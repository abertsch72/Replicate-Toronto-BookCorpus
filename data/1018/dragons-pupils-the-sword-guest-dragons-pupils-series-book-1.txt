Prologue
Fifth Century, China. 

Zhang lifted his calligraphy pen from the south wall of Anle temple, stepped back, stroked his long white beard, and smiled. He had been painting for three months, and now he had finally completed the last scale on the last dragon on the last wall of the temple.
‘What a masterpiece!’ the chief monk of Anle temple exclaimed. ‘Master Zhang, these have to be the best dragons you ever painted.’ He accompanied Zhang, followed by a large procession of monks, around the temple’s walls, now stepping back to see each of the four ferocious creatures in full, now leaning close to inspect the exquisite features such as a curve of a spur or a filmy twist of steam.
Following along the dragon’s long wangled tangled body, the group reached the end of the west wall, where the dragon met the dragonhead stretched around the corner from the south wall.
‘Look at these talons—they could definitely cut your finger,’ said one monk.
‘You could almost pull their whiskers,’ said another.
‘Master Zhang, how many dragons have you painted in your life time?’ asked the chief monk.
‘Well,’ Zhang stroked his beard. ‘Today I finished my ninety-ninth.’
‘Ninety-nine dragons! Truly incredible! I’ll apply for the Emperor’s permission to rename the temple the “Four Dragon Temple”.’
The chef monk heard a quiet babble behind him. He turned around. ‘What’s the matter?’
A young monk in his early twenties blushed. ‘Sorry, chief monk and master Zhang. I just noticed that there are no pupils on these two dragons.’
‘What? Let me have a look.’ The chief monk stepped forward, staring at the dragons’ eyes from only inches away. ‘Yes, you are right; there are no pupils in their eyes. Master Zhang, could you please explain?’
Zhang looked at the cloudless blue sky for a few seconds, and then said slowly, ‘I haven’t forgotten to paint their pupils. If I did, they would fly away.’
Surprised noises rose from the crowd of monks.
‘Please be quiet,’ the Chief Monk said. ‘Master Zhang, we cannot have pupil-less dragons on our temple walls. You know the Emperor visits annually. It would be unforgivable if the emperor noticed the error…’
‘Chief Monk, it is not an error; the dragons would fly away if I painted their pupils.’
More noise rose from the crowd.
The chief monk raised his hand for quiet. ‘Master Zhang, as the chief monk of Anle temple, I formally request that you paint the dragons’ pupils.’
Zhang looked at the endless blue sky for a long time, and then sighed. ‘All right, I’ll do it; but be prepared.’ Taking out his calligraphy pen, he made four rapid strokes on the wall. 
As soon as the pupils appeared in the dragons’ eyes, they winked and twisted their whiskers a bit; large chunky rain clouds gathered in the blue sky, and the two dragons wiggled their bodies. 
A bright bolt of lightning struck the walls, and they crumbled. The two dragons shook themselves and leapt into sky, against the heavy grey rain. There was a roar of wind and a howl of thunder, and they disappeared into the dark clouds. 
The two walls with the pupil-less dragons remained intact.








Part one

Saturday Morning

Perth, Western Australia

‘Time to go!’ Henry knocked on Liz’s bedroom door.
Turning her bedside light on, Liz glanced at her clock. ‘In a minute!’ Eyes closed, she dragged herself to the edge of her bed, searching the floor with her feet. A couple of minutes later, holding her shoes and a pair of socks, she walked downstairs slowly. While Henry held the flyscreen door open waiting patiently for his twin, Liz sat on the floor and put on her socks and sneakers.
‘Ready?’ said Henry.
‘Yeah, let’s go.’ 

	It was very foggy. Along the Swan River, jogging on the damp grass, Liz could only see five metres ahead. Through the heavy mists drifting above the water, a large flock of black swans emerged.
It was strange. Liz had never seen so many black swans before. Then, along the river bank, more and more birds came into sight—hundreds of pelicans, black water birds, seagulls, and ducks. What was going on here? These birds usually came out here at dusk, and in summer, not winter! Then she saw the reason—hundreds of little fish had jumped out of water and were flopping on the riverbank; the birds were having a feast.
Henry pointed at the birds. ‘What’s going on?’
Before Liz opened her mouth, a blast of screeching heralded a large group of white parrots swooping down at them. 
No time to think but act. Throwing herself to the ground, burying her face in the grass and crossing her arms behind her neck to protect her head, Liz felt the breeze from hundreds of fluttering wings only inches away. The noise was deafening. 
A few minutes later, although it felt like eternity, the world became quiet again. 
‘This is mad! Fortunate I…we both reacted so quickly; otherwise God knows what would have happened to us!’ Henry spat out bits of grass and gave Liz a hand up. 
Liz stared at the clusters of birds fighting for a share of the suicidal fish, said. “Yes I agree with you that something was wrong with those parrots: we haven’t seen them for months, and there have never been so many of them and being so aggressive.”
 ‘We’d better go.’ Henry said.
They resumed their jogging. 

	Across the Narrows Bridge and across the overhead pathway they ran, up the steep hill of Kings Park. It was hard to keep jogging on the zigzag uphill paths. After reaching the hilltop near the war memorial, Liz and Henry bent, hands on their knees, panting heavily. When they raised their heads again, the river, the bridge, and Perth city were nowhere to be seen. The only thing in sight was the mist drifting over the hill.
‘We’re already five minutes late.’ Henry glanced at his watch trying to encourage Liz to hurry up. 
‘I heard you,’ said Liz.
They jogged downhill towards a flat grassy area, and Li Ping and Sue materialised from the fog when they were only a few metres away. ‘Sorry we’re late,’ panted Liz.
‘It’s all right,” said Li Ping. “We’ve only been here a couple of minutes. Shall we start?’ 
While Li Ping walked among them, Liz, Sue and Henry started the slow, graceful Tai Chi movements, moving smoothly from the ‘Immortal Crane Stretching Her Wings’ to ‘Wild Horse Galloping’; then from ‘Single Arrow Shooting Two Eagles’ to ‘Fishing Moon from the Bottom of the Sea’. In the next hour, they accomplished the seventy-two cycles of Tai Chi.
‘You are doing very well,’ Li told Henry, ‘but recently you seem to have been losing your concentration a bit during class. Can you tell me why?’
‘We’ve been doing this Tai Chi for so many years, and now we’ve mastered all cycles you taught us, so it’s a bit boring. I wish that I could learn something more exciting, like hand to hand combat skills.’
‘Henry, you may think you have mastered all seventy-two cycles of Tai Chi, but I haven’t even started to teach you the real stuff yet.’
‘What do you mean?’
‘Do you know that Tai Chi can be used in real combat? Moreover, it is far more powerful than any other martial art you have ever heard about.’
‘You must be joking; these slow moves can be used in real combat?’ 
The fog had become much thinner, so now they could see quite a distance. Henry pointed at a tree near the footpath. ‘Look at that dog; it’s climbed a tree.’
Li turned around. ‘That is a bit strange.’
‘I almost forgot.’ Liz told Li about the strange behaviour of birds and fish earlier that morning.
The smile faded from Li’s face. She counted on her fingers, mumbling words that Liz did not understand; Mandarin, she assumed. A few minutes later, Li said. ‘That is all for today; I’ll have to fly to Beijing tonight, but I should be back in a couple of days. Hopefully, we can still have our class next Saturday.’
‘Are you going to teach us combat Tai Chi next weekend?’ Henry asked.
‘Wait and see.’ Li left.
‘I thought Li Ping was flying to Beijing on Tuesday,’ Sue said.
‘That’s what I thought. Sue, I feel so tired…’
‘If you’d gone to bed a bit earlier last night, you’d have had more sleep,’ Henry interrupted.
‘I had so much homework. I never have time to do it all, because I have so many after-school activities.’
‘Maybe you should drop some of them,’ Sue said.
‘That’s what I thought; actually I’m thinking of dropping Tai Chi class…’ Liz’s voice trailed off.
‘What? Are you serious? You can’t do that to Sue and me! Remember the combat Tai Chi?’
‘Henry, stop it. Liz, I have the same problem. My mother actually suggested dropping the dancing class.’
‘But you want to be a model…’ Liz said.
‘Mum doesn’t think it’s a good career for me.’
Liz glanced at her watch. ‘Let’s talk about this another day. Anyway, see you at the tree planting this afternoon.’ 

As Liz and Henry walked in the door, their parents came downstairs, seemingly ready to go out. 
‘Happy birthday, sweeties, I can’t believe that you’re fourteen years old!’ Their mother hugged Liz and then Henry.
‘Happy birthday,’ Liz’s father patted her head and then Henry’s shoulder.
‘Thanks, Dad.’
‘Dad and I are going to a swap meet (similar to car boot sale). Oh, I almost forgot; Dad’s going to cook a Sichuan banquet for your birthday tonight.’
Oh, no—not a Chinese meal for her birthday, particularly her father’s cooking! And he didn’t even have the courage to tell her directly. Liz shook her head and went upstairs to have a shower. 

‘A dozen scholars have gone missing from a conference in London…still under investigation…’ Pushing his empty plate aside, Henry read the newspaper while engulfing a large bowlful of rice bubbles, cornflakes, and soymilk. 
‘Here’s more news: rare parrots have been spotted near Wave Rock—they were supposed to be extinct two hundred years ago... Hang on, I can’t believe this—the government has approved the mining project!’ He pounded his fist on the table so hard that the contents of his bowl splashed over the newspaper.
‘I already knew.’ Liz did not raise her head from her part of the newspaper.
‘So what should we do? Just sit here and watch the multinational mining companies destroying another Aboriginal sacred site, and cutting down more forests? How can you sit there so calmly?’
‘Calm down, little brother. Sue told me that Fred has already organised a protest in front of the State Parliament House during lunchtime this Monday.’
‘Thank God for that. Why didn’t you tell me earlier? Where was I when Sue told you?’ 
‘It was yesterday. I forgot to tell you. Please forgive me, little brother.’
‘Can you please stop calling me “little brother”? It embarrasses me in front of others. I’m fourteen years old, for God’s sake. You’re only a few minutes older than me.’
‘All right, I promise I won’t call you “little brother” again, little brother … whoops, slip of the tongue.’ 
‘So tell me, what exactly are the arrangements for the Monday protests? When, where, and who are going to join the action?’ 
‘I really don’t know. Sue didn’t tell me any details; she had to rush home.’ 
Henry was going to say something but stopped. He was staring through the sliding glass door. ‘Mice!’ They both ran towards the door. In amazement, they watched the mice, dozen of them, scurry across the yard and disappear in a hole under the fence. 
‘Wow! Boy! I’ve never seen so many mice at once,’ exclaimed Henry.
It was even more astonishing to Liz that their cat simply sat and watched the mice walking under her nose. ‘What’s wrong with Molly? She’s just sitting there and watching.’
‘Maybe she’s become a vegetarian,’ joked Henry.
Liz laughed, and was about to reply when she heard screaming. She dashed to the front door, and burst out, Henry hot on her heels.
’Go away, go away, go away!’ Sue’s hands covered her eyes; her feet in elegant pastel joggers stamped, and her voice rose higher with every word. At her feet a group of mice scurried around her and across the driveway. Henry laughed.
‘Stop it, Henry.’ Liz put an arm around Sue’s shoulder. ‘It’s all right, just some harmless mice. They’re gone now.’
‘Ooh, I hate mice! Are you sure they’re all gone?’ Sue peeped through her fingers and put her hands down, looking around as if she feared a mouse ambush.
‘Come inside. Would you like a glass of water?’ No sooner were they inside than Sue started screaming again. This time Liz was inclined to join her. 
 ‘What’s wrong with you? It’s just a cockroach.’ Henry got a handful of paper towels from the kitchen, and picked up the huge cockroach; at least four inches long, and threw it into the garden, where it scurried under a bush. ‘All done.’ 
‘Aren’t you going to wash your hands?’ 
‘Later. What’s up?’
Sue took a deep breath. ‘Fred just found out that the mining company is going to open the mine this afternoon.’ 
‘What do you mean, open the mine?’ 
‘They’re going to blow up Wave Rock.’ 
‘What?’ Liz and Henry shouted at the same time.
‘Yes. So Fred and other EPP (Environmental Protection Party) members are going out there to protest, and they’ll be here to pick us up at quarter to nine.’ 
‘That’s right now.’ Henry stared at his watch. ‘Right, let’s go.’
‘But we haven’t told Mum and Dad,’ said Liz.
‘How do we do that? They don’t even have a mobile phone. Just write them a note. They always agree with us,’ replied Henry.
Liz scribbled a note while he grabbed water bottles and a pack. ‘Are you going in those clothes, Sue?’
Sue looked down at her miniskirt and cute little top. ‘They’re the latest fashion.’
‘Grab a pair of old jeans from my room. You can’t go to a protest like that.’ Liz saw Sue about to argue, and added, ‘They might get dusty.’
‘Oh. Right.’ Sue disappeared, and returned in an old pair of jeans and a baggy T-shirt. A toot came from the road.
‘Let’s go.’ Henry burst out of the door, the girls close behind. Liz looked at Sue, who was tying her hair back. Once she decided to do something, she didn’t do it half-heartedly. It was one of the things Liz liked about her. 
Liz grinned. ‘Let’s have an adventure.’

Wave Rock

The Four-Wheel-Drive-tourist bus was full of members of EPP. Liz was impressed that Fred had been able to hire the bus and gather so many people in such a short time. He was so efficient. Henry and Sue found seats together at the back, and the only place left was right next to Fred himself, who was driving. Liz slid into it, feeling shy. Fred smiled at her and she felt herself blushing. She was glad when he turned away again and concentrated on the road. Sue and Henry talked and giggled in the back seats, but everyone else was quiet for most of the long drive. Liz was glad she didn’t have to make conversation, because every time she was near Fred, her tongue tied up in knots, or said the most stupid things that made her groan inside. He’s just Sue’s big brother, she told herself, but it made no difference. 
Her hands were in the wrong place. She crossed her arms; it seemed an aggressive gesture. She moved her hands beside her hips, but felt very silly. Her face burned. She was sure Fred was laughing at her. 
Pretending to look at something on the far side of the road, Liz glanced at Fred. His handsome face looked very serious, his eyes focusing on the road. He might not have noticed what she was doing after all. Liz felt a bit easier and sat up, but at the same time, she felt quite disappointed. Whenever Fred looked at her, he was always serious. She had heard people say that Fred could become the youngest senator in Australian history, and that he might become Australian president—assuming Australia would be a republic one day. No wonder he had a sort of business-like manner. Liz couldn’t blame him; and besides, the only things she could ever talk to him about without embarrassing herself were environmental activities, like tree planting, or cleaning rubbish along the coast. He looked at her seriously then, and spoke to her seriously.
Liz wished that he would look at her in a different way, even in the way he looked at his sister. Sometimes, Liz felt jealous of Sue, who was able to laugh and joke with Fred. Sometimes they even wrestled together. Liz sighed.

The strange morning fog lifted as they drove south. They moved through the forested hills to York, and slid through the quiet Saturday streets. As the bus slowed coming to a STOP sign, Liz noticed a turtle near the lamp-post. Its head slowly stretched out of its shell, and it started crawling across the road. Cars roared forward, only centimetres away. The poor turtle contracted its head and legs back to its shell. 
‘Let me help it,’ said Liz.
‘Liz, I understand your feeling towards the turtle,’ Fred smiled at her. ‘I feel the same. Unfortunately, we don’t have time to help it; trust me, it’ll be all right.’ 
‘Look! More!’ Without meaning to, she pulled the lever that opened the door and jumped out. There were loads of them. She picked up two and carried them across the street to the grassy bank leading to the river. Behind her she heard footsteps as other EPP members climbed out and helped other turtles across. In a few minutes the work was done; everyone piled back into the bus and it drove off. Fred gave her a measured nod. 
‘You were right, Liz. Sometimes I forget that small things are important too.’ Liz looked at her hands, folded comfortably in her lap, and settled contentedly in her seat. 
A few kilometres later they passed a huge red kangaroo, dead at the side of the road. Then another, and another. The protesters, who had begun to talk a bit after the turtle incident, fell silent as they passed body after body. 
‘I didn’t know so many cars used this road,’ said Liz in a small voice. 
‘They don’t, usually,’ said Fred. ‘Or so many kangaroos, either.’ He slowed down a bit. ‘If a roo jumps out, all you can do is run straight into it. Otherwise you can skid and kill people.’ 
‘Are people more important than kangaroos?’ Liz asked. Fred smiled at her, but didn’t answer; he was slowing and turning off onto a forest track. As the bus made the turn, Liz saw police cars and flashing lights in the distance. 
The road was unsealed, just wide enough for the bus to drive on, and rough. Liz clung to her seat as they bumped and tilted along the narrow road. Now she understood why Fred was using a four-wheel drive bus.

They jolted along for almost an hour, and Liz felt her insides would never untangle. Just as she decided they would never reach Wave Rock, the forest fell away and, as suddenly as scenes changed in the movies, vast red desert dotted with low shrubby bushes appeared. The bus turned, driving along the edge of red gum forest. 
A group of kangaroos burst out of the forest in front of them. Fred braked sharply. Something thudded against the bumper. Fred stopped and climbed out; from his expression, Liz guessed that no kangaroo had been killed. Then, as he climbed back into the driver’s seat, hundreds of kangaroos bounded out of the forest into the red desert. Emus, the fastest running birds on earth, sprinted among them, and on the red sandy ground geckos, goannas, and blue tongue lizards crawled; black-headed pythons, tiger snakes, and dugites zigzagged; wombats, quokkas, wallabies, bush rats, echidnas, bandicoots, made a moving carpet rolling out across the vast red sand. Above, rainbow lorikeets, white cockatoos, crimson rosellas, tawny frogmouth owls, wedge-tailed eagles, and thousands of other birds darkened the bright sky and made thunder with their wings. 
The bus became dark. All Liz could hear were grunts and scrapes and flapping and panting. 

Twenty minutes later, the animals were gone as if they had never existed.
‘What’s going on?’ asked Sue, who had crept forward and had an arm over her brother’s shoulder as she stared at the dust cloud the animals had raised. 
‘It must be an earthquake coming. I read about it somewhere; whenever a disaster’s going to happen, animals escape like this. They have an instinct for sensing danger beforehand, and humans don’t,’ said Henry.
‘But Western Australia’s never had an earthquake,’ said Liz.
‘Then it must be a volcano eruption, except we don’t have any. No, I’ve got it—t has to be a bushfire,’ stated Henry.
‘Bushfires happen here all the time, but when did you see animals behaving like this?’ said Liz.
‘It must be a massive bushfire,’ replied Henry.
‘Well, whatever it is, we have to do what we have to do.’ Fred started the bus again, and everyone breathed the fresh moving air with relief.

Approaching Wave Rock, Liz wondered whether she would dare to fight the police if they tried to arrest her. Her stomach sank when she imagined being dragged into a police car. She imagined her parents watching her being arrested on television, and wished she had been able to speak to them before she came. They would worry. 
‘Here we are,’ Fred said, and the bus stopped with a jerk, pulling her out of her thoughts. She glanced around.
They were not the first to arrive. A small group of protesters had already chained themselves together and was chanting and waving placards. 
‘Animal rights party,’ Fred told her, waving at the woman who seemed to be in charge. ‘This way, everyone, and bring the chains.’ He led the EPP group forward, and they joined themselves to the chained group. A television helicopter hovered overhead, and then came down to land in a storm of dust. When Liz could see again, another group had arrived. 
‘Look,’ she said to Henry, who was chained next to her. ‘That’s Professor Smith.’
‘Who?’ asked Sue, on her other side.
‘Professor Smith. I met him at an environmental rally once; he’s a specialist in ancient religions and stuff. And that old man, next to him, isn’t that Mr. Dingo? The one who came to our school and talked to us about Aboriginal spirituality?’
‘So it is,’ said Henry. ‘Wonder what they’re doing here?’
‘Well, this is a sacred Aboriginal site, so perhaps they’re protesting too,’ said Sue. She flipped her hair. ‘Do you think we’ll be on television, because my hair’s a mess?’
But before the cameras could roll, a group of soldiers arrived, and things got hectic. Bolt-cutters appeared, and the line of protesters rolled and wriggled to make things difficult. Liz was vaguely aware of more people arriving, and scuffling and cursing as soldiers tried to clear people out and cordon off the area. The bolt-cutters came nearer and nearer; Henry had been cut free, and was being hauled to the back of an army truck. Liz twisted and heaved, trying to stop the soldier getting a grip on the chain, but she too was cut away and dragged to the truck. She had dust in her eyes. She heard Henry’s angry voice yell, ‘Take your hands off me’, and turned around, seeing two soldiers pinning Henry in the red dust. 
‘Let him go!’ Liz forgot her fear about fighting with police, and leapt onto the back of the soldier nearest her, kicking and punching. Then she felt herself lifted off and held in a strong grasp.
‘Please let him go. We‘re on our way home.’ Fred spoke calmly.
‘Let him go? He’s under arrest for assaulting a NSF soldier,’ one of soldiers said, wiping blood from his mouth.
‘I didn’t assault anybody. You grabbed me and pushed me first,’ Henry shouted, spitting red dust out of his mouth, and tried to punch the soldier. Fred grabbed him with his free hand and hauled him away. 
‘Stop it!’ Fred told him. He turned to the officer in charge of the soldiers. ‘Please let him go, and I guarantee that I’ll take him and the rest of my group away without any more trouble.’
‘Release him,’ the officer barked. ‘And now you lot get out of here!’
Fred led the twins to the bus, and gathered up the rest of the EPP members. Henry wiped his mouth with his sleeve. ‘If Li had taught me combat Tai Chi they never would have got me.’
‘Just as well, then,’ said Liz tartly. Henry gave her a dirty look and headed for the back of the bus, where Sue was already sitting. Fred started the engine. ‘What was Professor Smith doing here?’ she asked him.
He shrugged. ‘I didn’t get to speak to him, but someone said he tried to kill himself and the soldiers stopped him.’
‘My God!’ Liz was shocked. Professor Smith must have been really upset about something to go that far. She hoped that he hadn’t done it in front of the news cameras, or there would have to be a lot of explaining to anxious parents when she got home. She sat in silence all the way, wondering what, if anything, they had accomplished.

Birthday 

Liz and Henry arrived home just before dinnertime. Her dad had spent the whole day preparing the meal, and Sue was invited to have dinner with them.
‘Liz, thanks for leaving us the note; otherwise, I’d’ve had no idea where you were,’ Liz’s mother said.
‘I’m sorry, Mum…’
 ‘It’s all right this time, but next time when you embark on such a big adventure, I’d like to know beforehand.’
‘I promise.’ 
Liz felt enormous relief that her mother didn’t ask what happened at Wave Rock. She tried to justify her action because of the urgency of the event, but deep down she knew that she should have got permission from her parents first; after all, she and Henry were only fourteen. She promised herself that she would not be so thoughtless again.
Liz and Sue went upstairs to clean up. 
‘Sue, I’m sorry you have to endure tonight’s dinner. You know you could say no and I wouldn’t be offended at all.’
‘It’s not a problem. I enjoy your dad’s spicy dishes; they’re a good change from my mother’s cooking.’
‘I don’t mind Dad’s cooking so much as the ye olde China stuff that goes with it, all the Tao wisdom and ancient folk tales and stuff. I wish he would be more Australian.’
‘Well, I like your dad. He’s sort of… quaint. And I like those stories. They always seem to mean something more, just under the surface out of sight.’
Liz groaned. ‘Well, you’re welcome to them. Would you like to use the bathroom first, then we’ll go down and listen to the tale of the old man or the young girl and the horse or the chicken or the river, and eat moo shoo pork or something.’
Sue poked her tongue out at her on her way to the shower. 

‘Honey, these dishes smell wonderful!’ Liz’s mum announced as the family gathered around the table later that evening.
‘Be honest, Dad’s cooking has been quite good and consistent recently,’ said Henry.
‘They look so colourful,’ said Sue. They picked up their chopsticks and dug in.
‘This fish fragrant pork is the best you ever cooked,’ Henry commented around a mouthful of the spicy pork dish. ‘I like the aroma of the mixed but still distinguishable flavours of chilli, garlic, ginger, and spring onions, not to mention the melt-in-your-mouth meat strings.’
‘Enough professional comment from you,’ his mother said.
‘I like this tofu dish, but I wish that you hadn’t put beef mince in so I wouldn’t have to separate it from the tofu every time,’ said Liz. She caught Sue grinning at her and smiled back. ‘But it is delicious anyway. Thanks, Dad.’

Afterwards, in the living room, Liz and Henry unwrapped their birthday presents. Last of all was one from their father. He gave Liz a small rectangular package and Henry a large rectangular one. From the shape of Henry’s package, Liz guessed that it was books. Probably more Tao wisdom, she thought, like the ones they had got last year. Each twin still had them, untouched, on the bookshelves in their bedrooms. 
Henry pretended to be surprised when he opened his package. It was a book about Chinese philosophy. He thanked his father, and put the books on the coffee table. Liz wondered if her poor father realised that they had never, and would never, read the books he gave to them. She felt a little guilty, and decided to put more effort into being surprised and delighted by his gift. She opened the package carefully, trying not to tear the paper, and uncovered a dark green silk-covered box. She hugged her father. ‘Thanks, Dad. It’s beautiful!’ 
‘Aren’t you going to open it? Or do you just love the box?’
Liz felt her face burn. ‘Dad, I know there’s a Chinese calligraphy pen inside. I really like it. I do. I promise I’ll use it to write some Chinese characters, maybe for your birthday or Chinese New Year.’
‘Sue, could you please help me?’ Liz’s mum and Sue went to the kitchen.
Her father blinked and smiled at her, and Liz, remorseful, opened the lid. As expected, she found a traditional Chinese calligraphy pen inside: but it was not quite as expected. In fact, it looked very strange. Although she was no expert on pens, Liz immediately recognised that this was not a product of the ‘Made in China’ variety. Firstly, the ring binding the brush inside the shaft was not plastic, but some kind of bone. Secondly, at the end of the shaft, was a black ball, a most unusual item, made of a dark stone engraved with a Yin-Yang sign. The pen’s shaft was a reddish wood and, judging by the scars, had been well used. And finally, the brush hairs were loose, unlike the hairs of new pens that were always glued tightly together into a sharp point. 
‘It’s quite unusual. Where did you get it from?’ she asked.
‘I got it from...’ 
The lights suddenly went off. 
Liz’s mum and Sue came back in holding a cake each and singing ‘Happy birthday’; fourteen candles on each cake made the room quite bright.
While Liz looked at the floor thinking about the strange calligraphy pen and Henry danced about, impatient to get a slice. ‘Make a wish,’ said Sue, and Henry closed his eyes and blew his candles out with gusto. 
‘I bet I know what you wished for,’ Sue said when everyone was settled with a piece of cake. ‘You want to be a martial arts master, Henry, and you, Liz…’
Liz interrupted. ‘Well, I’m definitely not becoming a fashion model. I know what you’re going to say, but this time you’re wrong.’ Liz turned to her father. ‘Dad, tell us where you got this pen from.’ She explained about the pen to her mother and Sue.
‘I wanted to give you a surprise.’ Her father drank some of his green tea. ‘You might expect it to be a new pen, but you would never guess that I bought it at the swap meet this morning. Ha, I tricked you.’
Liz sometimes wondered if her father would grow up.
‘Let me have a look.’ Her mum picked up the pen. ‘The Tai Chi ball looks very cute. What‘s the writing on it?’ 
‘It’s a famous Chinese idiom, and can be translated as “the magic pen can paint a flower blossom’”,’ said Liz’s father. ‘Have you heard another famous pen-related idiom, “forming a full bamboo in your heart before you paint it”?’
‘No, I haven’t,’ Sue said, ‘but I’d like to hear about it.’
Liz put down her empty plate, picked up Henry’s book, and pretended to read. None of her father’s words registered in her mind; they were just a long series of blurred, meaningless noises that finally and thankfully came to an end.
‘Wow, that’s interesting,’ said Henry. ‘Can I have a look at the pen?’ he grabbed for it, and it fell out of the box onto the tiles. The shaft split, and a beam of light flashed from the crack as if there was a diamond inside. 
Liz bent and picked up her broken gift. 
‘I’m sorry, Dad, I didn’t mean to break it,’ Henry said. ‘I’ll get you another one, Liz.’
‘It’s very old. Maybe it’s time for it to be broken anyway,’ her father said. 
Liz turned it over in her hands. ‘Look! There’s another layer underneath.’
Everyone moved closer. Henry snatched the pen out of Liz’s hands. ‘The layer underneath looks a bit yellowish,’ he said, and used his thumbnail to push the crack wider apart.
‘Don’t! Be careful!’ exclaimed Liz, but suddenly the shaft broke into pieces like a pile of burned paper ashes. 
‘Whoops! Wow, look what we’ve got here.’ Henry brushed off fragments of the old shaft. The shaft underneath looked like bamboo, yellow with black patches.
‘Let me have a look!’ Their father suddenly became very excited. He stared at the bamboo shaft intensely. ‘This must be teardrop bamboo.’ 
‘What’s that?’ Sue asked. 
Even before her father spoke, Liz knew another Chinese story was on its way. ‘It is an ancient fairytale. After their emperor father died, two beautiful princesses wept in a bamboo forest; their tears dropped on the bamboo, staining them in beautiful patterns. People have called it teardrop bamboo ever since.’
‘It’s a beautiful story,’ said Sue.
 ‘I don’t like these kinds of Chinese fairytales, always sad and depressing,’ said Liz’s mum.
Good on you, Mum, always direct telling Dad what your thoughts are. Still, Liz thought, I wish I could be as kind as Sue. I wish I could enjoy Dad’s stories. But they are sad—or pointless—or both. Often both.
‘That’s part of Chinese culture, Mum. You should know that after living with Dad for the last twenty years. I just wonder if there’s another layer underneath the brush hairs.’ Henry pulled the brush hairs jokingly. To everyone’s amazement, a layer came out. 
‘What kind of hair is this?’ 
The brush hairs were different from usual. Liz knew that wool, horsetail, rabbit or wolf hairs were used in brushes, but these were much thicker. Besides, they were dark blue. 
Her father touched the brush hairs with a gentle finger. ‘According to legend, the Yellow Emperor of China received a Dragon Whisker Pen from the Four Sea Dragon King at his coronation.’ He mumbled softly as he spoke, as if his words were surfacing from long lost memories.
‘Well, that’s not much help; we all know that dragons don’t exist,’ said Liz.
‘Has anybody managed to prove God exists? Lighten up, Liz, it’s just a fairy tale,’ said Henry.
Liz took her pen off him before he could think of something else to do to it, and put it back in its box. Behind her, her father turned the TV on. It was a newsbreak. 
‘IPCC (The Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change) has just released a report establishing a link between human activities and global warming. Experts say that if we do not reduce greenhouse pollution significantly in the next ten years, it may be too late …’ 
Henry snidely commented, ‘We know that already, don’t we?’
‘Shush, Henry, listen.’ But the newsreader had moved on to the next item. 
‘An explosion at Wave Rock this afternoon has left several people dead….’ 
The three of them stared at the screen in shock. Soldiers with arms in slings were carrying stretchers; ambulances raced along the dirt road, sirens screaming; people milled helplessly, looking lost and frightened. ‘The shock has left many people disoriented and confused. Many say they saw monsters escaping from the rocks, soon after the explosion.’ The reporter stuck a microphone under the nose of a man with blood running down one side of his face. ‘Father McCabe, tell us what you saw.’
‘Hundreds and thousands of ancient monsters have been released. People are going to be slaughtered, eaten, and innocent people’s blood will flow on the streets…’ He raised a shaking finger and pointed at the rock, shouting, but the reporter had lost interest. He looked earnestly into the camera. ‘Whether or not the tale of the monsters is true, there is a mystery about the explosion. The mining company denies setting explosives, and has issued a statement deploring the destruction of this great wonder of the Australian landscape. Back to you, Dave.’
Behind him, Father McCabe’s hand shakily showed a black, gaping hole in the half-destroyed rock. 
Liz no longer heard what was being said; her mind was focused on the hole in the ruined Wave Rock. The old man’s words echoed inside her head over and over again. He had looked like a mad prophet, standing with his arm outstretched like that; and his words had the ring of truth.

Picnic

Sunday, 80 Kilometres East of Perth

The next day, Sunday, was fine. Liz and her family went to have a picnic at Lake Leschenaultia.
Sitting on the back seat of her mother’s car, Liz watched the landscape gradually change as they drove on: from the city high-rise to suburban houses, from car yards and shopping centres into hills, from concrete to trees. Their car climbed to the top of the hill, and there, in thick bush, was their picnic destination. 
People were everywhere, carrying huge eskies (cool boxes), fold-up chairs and tables, picnic rugs, cricket bats, and footballs. Australians loved outdoor activities.
Seeing Sue run towards their car, Liz rolled down her window and waved. Sue told them that they had a good picnic spot. As Sue directed, Liz’s mother parked her car close to the foreshore picnic area.
Fred hadn’t come. He rarely joined these kinds of family activities; too busy doing other more important things, as Sue explained each time. Even though she knew this, Liz had hoped he might call in for some unknown reason; she could think of millions of reasons.
Liz and Henry helped their parents carry things out of the car, and got the picnic area set up with all the paraphernalia Julie considered essential for outdoor living. 
‘Julie, would you like some ice?’ Sue’s mother asked Liz’s mother. She sat on the black fold-up chair, holding a glass of white wine.
‘What a good idea! Linda, you are so organised,’ Liz’s mother said.
‘Wen, what about a beer?’ Sue’s dad asked Liz’s dad.
‘Oh, sorry, beer? No, thank you, I’ve got one here.’ Liz’s dad took a bottle of beer out of the esky and put it in a beer-holder with an Australia flag and kangaroo on it, a Christmas present from Liz. Although he often seemed lost in his own world, Liz noticed he had become worse recently, particularly today; he mumbled some words to himself from time to time. Mandarin, she assumed.
Looking at her father, Liz sighed inwardly. She didn’t blame him for his lack of ability and disinterest in socialising with the others because of his introverted personality and not-so-advanced language skills, but it was his lack of courage that bothered her. For instance, once when Liz and her father were walking in the park, she overheard a conversation behind their backs. ‘Those Chinks come here and take away our jobs. We should send all of them home.’ Liz was angry and wanted to shout at the people, but her father had dragged her away. She wished that he was better at sticking up for himself. 
Liz suddenly felt she had to get away from the wine and the beer and the whole plastic outdoor scene. She jumped to her feet. ‘I’m going for a walk. Anyone coming with me?’ Without waiting to find out, she started walking along the lake’s white sand beach. Behind her, footsteps hurried and then slowed to her pace. Sue and Henry joined her. 
Even though it was winter the weather was quite warm, and the air was still. Liz breathed in deeply, trying to shake off her mood.
’Are you okay?’ Sue asked.
‘Sure. Let’s just go a bit further.’ Liz headed away from the lake, and they walked a few minutes into the thick bush. 
In front of them, the bush suddenly became sparse, like a deserted island in the sea, with dead tree trunks sticking out of the white sandy ground. 
Liz took out her new calligraphy pen, the birthday present from her father. A light beam shot into the sky. ‘Did you see the flash?’ Liz asked Sue.
‘Yes, I did,’ said Sue.
‘It must be the reflection of sunlight,’ said Henry.
‘I don’t think so; I saw it last night,’ said Liz.
‘So what’s unusual about it?’ asked Henry.
‘I’m not sure if it’s just my imagination, but I felt it vibrate and get hotter in my pocket,’ replied Liz.
‘Why did you bring it with you to a picnic?’ asked Henry.
‘I couldn’t stop thinking about it last night; there are so many unusual things about it. I have a strong feeling this is not just an ordinary pen,’ said Liz.
Henry shrugged. ‘Well, we can’t work out the secret by standing here. Let’s go and do something. What about canoeing on the lake?’ 
‘Good idea,’ Liz agreed. They followed Sue towards the lake. Sue suddenly stopped and screamed. Liz saw a snake, at least three metres long, in front of them.
‘Keep still, Sue, don’t move, be cool. Remember snakes can’t see well…if we don’t move …it’s all right now.’ The snake slithered into the bush.
‘Liz, get me out of here. What if there’s more, like yesterday?’ Sue was starting to panic.
‘Take it easy, Sue, we’re on our way out. Just follow me.’ Henry led the way, and everyone followed. 
Ten minutes later, they were still surrounded by bush.
‘I thought we only walked into the bush about 200 metres,’ said Sue.
‘Yes, it’s a bit strange. We should have been out ages ago,’ said Liz.
Henry took over. ‘Let’s use our brains. Obviously we walked in the wrong direction in the past ten minutes, but it’s not a big deal; I’d say we’re less than half a kilometre away from the lake foreshore. This is obviously not the right direction.’ Henry pointed in the direction they just walked from.
‘I remember we were heading east when we walked into the bush,’ said Liz.
‘Sun is there, so that must be west. Let’s go!’ Henry led the way.
 ‘We’re back to where we were,’ Liz announced twenty minutes later.
‘I don’t think I can walk any more, and I’m thirsty.’ Sue sat on the ground after checking for snakes.
‘I’m sure that’s west.’ Henry looked at the sun again. ‘I don’t understand how this happened. We should be able to get to the lake within ten minutes.’
‘Not if we’re wandering around in circles,’ Sue imitated Henry’s voice.
‘Very funny, ha ha, so you tell us which way we should go.’ Henry sat down too.
‘We don’t even know which directions we’ve tried.’ Liz flopped beside Henry and Sue. 
‘Henry, help…’ Sue’s voice trailed off.
‘Another snake?’ 
‘No, it’s a spider.’
‘Sue, it’s just a tiny one. Please don’t be so babyish and scared of everything,’ said Henry.
‘Henry, stop it. Sue, sit here with me.’ 
With her back to the deserted white land, Liz felt quite hot after all the fast walking of the last half hour or so. ‘That’s a nice breeze.’
Sue’s face changed. Liz thought she had seen another spider, but then she saw Henry’s face change too; she turned her head and suddenly felt freezing cold.

The Unexpected

Between the dead tree trunks sticking out of the bare white sandy ground, Liz saw thousands of creatures emerge from the bushes, moving towards them. The sky had turned dark, chunky black clouds blocked the sunlight, and strong wind started building up. Heavy rain would pour down at any moment. 
Burying her head against Henry’s chest, Sue clung to him tightly. Henry’s eyes opened wide, and his jaw dropped. Liz somehow managed to keep watching what was happening in front of her.
In the dim light the creatures kept coming, straight towards them. 
As the first group drew closer, Liz could just make out that they were human. Their clothing looked strange, but she was too scared to work out what was wrong with it. 
At last the two figures at the head of the crowd were only metres away. The one on the left was a tall, thin person. Despite his dirty worn-out clothes, Liz could tell that he represented some kind of authority. When she looked at the man beside him, she almost fainted. His head was not a human but a bear head. Under normal circumstances, she would have thought it was somebody with a bear mask on, but she could clearly see it was a real bear head and the body was a real human body. 
A red kangaroo appeared, hopping into the clearing hesitantly. The bear monster leapt forward, and struck it with his huge palm; the kangaroo, over two metres tall, was knocked high in the air, landing twenty feet away on the ground, dead. 
As the bear monster walked over and began devouring his prey, the tall thin man applauded, and then walked towards Liz and her friends. 
Liz’s heart pounded violently, and her palms became sweaty and sticky. She put her hands into her pocket to wipe the sweat away, and as she did, her fingers touched the calligraphy pen. 
The pen felt hotter than before. 
The monsters were screaming, stamping, cheering and whistling. To her surprise, Liz could understand what they were shouting. ‘Vampire King! Vampire King! Vampire King!’
The tall thin man, the Vampire King, was only feet away. 
Feeling the calligraphy pen in her pocket jump (or maybe she jumped herself), Liz had an idea. Suddenly standing, she held her pen, pointing it at the Vampire King.
Nothing happened. 
The Vampire King started laughing. Liz still held the pen towards him. He stretched his arm and grasped the pen. 
There was a loud explosion. 
A rainbow light beam jetted from the calligraphy pen, shot into the cloudy sky, and tore the dark clouds apart, letting a thin ray of the sunlight through. 
Holding his hand as if it had been burned, the Vampire King barked, ‘Kill them! All of them!’ 
Waving their long sharp claws, three vampires ambled towards Liz and her friends. Under the dim light, holding on to Sue and Henry, Liz stared hopelessly at the approaching vampires and their sharp fangs.
The vampires’ claws inched towards Liz and her friends. They were intentionally prolonging the process of killing their victims, to enjoy their terrified expressions. Liz held tightly to her friends and prepared to die.

A tree branch cracked, making Liz turn her gaze upwards. A black-haired woman appeared on the treetop from nowhere. She broke a thick tree branch, like snapping a corn cracker, and waved it at the three monsters near Liz. They were swept high into air, landing twenty feet away with heavy thuds. The branch did not touch a hair of Liz. 
The black-haired woman held her broken branch and jumped seven metres to the ground. She landed soundlessly, like a cat; holding the huge tree branch in one hand, she used her other hand like an axe to chop the spurs off. It seemed that her hand only moved once or twice, but the flying tree leaves and twigs told a different story; in a few seconds, she turned the branch into a two-metre stick with a pointed end.
The Vampire King neither moved nor spoke; nobody moved.
From a standstill, the black haired woman leapt to stand in front of Liz. ’Please give me the calligraphy pen,’ she said, holding out her hand for it.
Liz gasped: it was Li Ping, her Tai Chi teacher! But there was no time to talk, and Liz passed the pen over.
Sadness appeared briefly on Li’s face. Running around Liz and her friends, she painted invisible lines and circles on the ground and in the air. Liz felt the pen touch her face a few times. A few seconds later, Li completed her actions and stood still. Nothing seemed to happen.
The Vampire King spoke. ‘Who are you? Are you going to fight with all of us on your own?’ 
‘I don’t really want to fight with you by myself. I’d prefer to wait for my army to arrive, and then we can have a formal battle; however, I do want these three young people alive. Give them to me, and I may let you live a bit longer—at least not kill you today.’ As Li spoke Liz could see her twisting the calligraphy pen behind her back, as if she was painting invisible pictures in the air. 
The King and his vampires burst into loud laughter. 
‘What you’ve just done is quite impressive, but unfortunately not good enough for me to hand the three over to you. Do you really think you are able to rescue them from all of my men?’ He stretched his arms to show how many monsters he had.
‘I have given you the choice; go ahead if this is what you want.’ Li Ping pointed her wooden stick at him. The Vampire King waved his hand, ordering the three vampires that Li had knocked down earlier to attack her. 
Li never stopped twisting the calligraphy pen behind her back, even when the vampires were only metres away. The vampires came to a standstill, moving sidewards and positioning themselves in a half circle in front of her.
The Vampire King shouted, ‘Kill her!’ At the same time, he waved to another three vampires to kill the three. 
Liz felt her stomach sink as the vampire on Li’s right slashed his razor-sharp claw at Li’s neck.

Tai Chi Teacher

Li barely moved; her upper body turned slightly and the vampire’s claw seemed to skip over her skin, while her wooden stick pierced his heart. The vampire let out a high-pitched scream, falling to the ground and twisting violently. In an instant he turned into a rotted corpse. The smell was so bad that everyone gagged. Liz almost vomited.
A split second later, the claw of the vampire on Li’s left almost stabbed her neck. Li twisted her body leftwards; and grabbed the vampire’s wrist, throwing him upwards. The vampire’s body flew high into the air and landed on the jagged remains of the branch where Li had broken off her wooden stick. It penetrated his heart, and this second corpse hung high in the tree. There was a sickening sound of rotten cloth tearing, and the corpse fell apart, bouncing and crashing to the ground. 
Hesitating for a moment, the third vampire reached with both claws to grab Li’s neck. Li’s upper body bent backwards fast. The vampire’s claws clashed into each other centimetres above her eyes. Spearing her stick into the vampire’s chest, Li jerked her arm, knocking the third stinking corpse beside her feet.
In all this time, Liz did not see Li moved her feet at all; only her body moving, turning, twisting and bending as gracefully as a flower in the spring breeze.
The three vampires ordered to kill Liz and her friends hadn’t seen what happened to their fellows. Upon hearing shocked cries, they glanced around in time to see three piles of stinking dirt vanish into the ground. 
The Vampire King turned to the bear monster who still sat beside the half-eaten kangaroo, and barked, ‘Monster King, send your monsters to kill her!’
Wiping his mouth with his bloody hand, the Monster King shook his huge bear head. ‘I don’t like to eat humans, not my cup of tea,’ he said, and went back to his kangaroo meat. 
‘How dare you disobey! I’ll deal with you after I kill her.’ Furious, the Vampire King commanded twenty vampires to attack the woman, and ordered the three vampires to kill the three. 
Waving their long sharp claws, with shrill screams, the three vampires rushed at Liz and her friends. 
A golden cage suddenly appeared around the three; the vampires crashed into the cage and were knocked back high in the air. Liz and Henry cheered with excitement. Sue, who had covered her eyes, peered out to see what was happening. Liz thought she looked quite different; Henry looked a bit strange, too; but she had no time to have a closer look; her attention was taken up by the battle in front of her.
Moving like ghosts, the twenty vampires took the blink of an eye to cover the twenty-metre distance to Li, waving their broadswords, long knives, war axes, and other strange killing weapons, forming a circle around her. In the middle, holding only the wooden stick, Li Ping stood motionless. 
It became so quiet that Liz heard her own heart beating. 
Suddenly, Li threw her stick high in the air. From nowhere, a green sword appeared in her hand. It slashed the air once, twice, and, Liz saw the stick, still in mid-air, turn into a pile of wooden darts. Li hit the darts with her sword; as if she had set a bomb among them, they exploded, and shot whistling at the vampires around her. A few were killed instantly. 
With ear piercing howls, the remaining vampires dashed at Li, but she stood motionless until the first vampire’s weapon was almost touching her skin. 
What happened next was too fast for Liz to follow; but twenty seconds later, only two vampires still stood. 
Pointing her green sword towards the bush behind Liz, Li shouted, ‘Ji!’
Liz spun round, and her eyes opened wide: hundreds of soldiers marched out of the bush towards the monsters. Their armour and weapons looked strange: old and foreign. 
The bear monster gave a loud roar, grabbed his half-eaten kangaroo, and ran across the clearing towards the forest. Hot behind him, the animal headed monsters followed. 
Looking at the vampires left around him, and then at the oncoming army, the Vampire King took out a black twisted stick; he shook it, and a grey spark shot at Li Ping. She ducked, but a spark tore a piece of cloth off her shoulder before hitting the vampire behind her. He caught on fire and exploded. 
Leaping forward fast and ducking a second grey spark, A third grey spark bypassed Li’s chest by less than half a finger. Li pointed her sword at the Vampire King, shooting out two green beams, one onto his right shoulder and the other onto his wand. The Vampire King groaned, fell, dropped his broken wand, and sank into the sandy ground. 
Li pointed her sword towards the ground and gazed at the vampire crowd. The vampires gave panicky whistles and backed away, soon disappearing into the bushes. 
The black clouds overhead vanished and the bright warm sunlight beat down again. 
As soon as the vampires disappeared, the golden cage around Liz and her friends vanished. Liz, Henry and Sue ran towards Li Ping. Dark green liquid seeped from the wound on her shoulder, and her face was very pale. 
‘Are you all right?’ Liz asked.
Li sank to the ground and struggled into the lotus position, eyes closed and body motionless. Liz put her finger on her lips to indicate Henry and Sue should be quiet. The three waited in silence.
Half an hour later, the liquid leaking from Li Ping’s wound had turned pale pink. Li opened her eyes and took a cloth from her pocket. Her face was calm and relaxed, as if nothing had happened to her. Liz took the cloth and helped bandage the wound.
‘Wow, we had no idea how powerful you are,’ said Sue.
‘Oh man, you know how to fight,’ said Henry.
‘If the monsters had stayed a few more seconds, the tables would have turned,’ said Li.
‘But they didn’t,’ said Henry. ‘Wait a minute, where’s your army?’
Liz had completely forgotten the strange army. Now there was no sign of a single soldier; they had vanished into air.
‘Can you please explain what just happened?’ Liz asked her teacher, squatting back on her heels.
‘I know that you have millions of questions.’ Li looked at Liz, Henry and Sue in turn. ‘But for now, I have to go and do something about my injury. I’ll talk to you all tomorrow morning. Could you all please keep what just happened a secret? I’ll explain the reason to you later.’ 
Li rose gracefully, and in two swift steps disappeared. 
If she had not still been able to see broken tree branches and kangaroo blood, Liz would have believed that what had happened was all in her imagination. She rose shakily, and the three looked at each other in silence. At last Liz suggested that they try to find their way back to the picnic site. This time they found the lake foreshore easily.
‘Good, you’re back. For a moment, I thought we would be caught in a thunderstorm,’ Liz’s mother said.
‘Mum, did you hear any noises while we were away?’
‘No. Why?’
‘Oh, nothing, I thought I heard some noises while walking in the bush.’
‘It must be the birthday party on other side of the lake,’ her mum replied.
‘You could be right, Mum,’ Henry grinned at Liz secretly.
Liz didn’t know if she felt better or worse: why had nobody else heard anything?

Giant Panda

The alarm went off. 
Turning the bedside light on, Liz glanced at her clock. Time to go jogging, but she was sure she had turned the alarm off last night. Murmuring to herself that she wanted to sleep just a bit more, she reached to turn the light off. There was something different on her bedside table.
Liz made a bleary inspection: beside her open half-read book was her fairy clock, a glass of water and her old teddy bear; behind the glass of water at the corner, she found what had caught her eye earlier, a paper crane. 
She stretched her arm and picked it up.
It was a cute paper crane, like those Liz had learnt to make in her Japanese classes, but subtle differences told her that this was a Chinese version; only someone familiar with both Chinese and Japanese paper folding arts could tell the difference. 
Who put it there? Sue? She had lived in Tokyo for many years when she was little, while her parents taught English there. She was able to speak fluent Japanese, and knew how to make those famous Japanese paper cranes. But since Liz had already decided this was a Chinese one, it couldn’t be her.
Staring at the delicate little crane on her palm, Liz thought she saw it move. She blinked and peered closer: the crane stood up and, with its legs pushing against Liz’s palm, launched itself into air. 
She watched it fly around her head. Gliding in beautiful smooth curves, it descended towards her. Hurriedly she put her hands together to form a landing platform. It alighted gently and cocked its head, staring at her, then collapsed and unfolded, turning itself into a note written in Chinese characters. Li wanted to meet her in their secret hideout in Kings Park. 
How did Li Ping know about that? Liz had never told her about it. Still, if Li Ping could do magic to defeat monsters, she could know anything she wanted to know. Liz thought some more: she had remembered to turn off her alarm last night, and Li Ping had used her magic to turn the alarm on and put the paper crane on her bedside table. 
Liz dressed, and went downstairs as quietly as possible; she didn’t want to disturb anybody else in the house, but in the living area, she was surprised to find her parents already up. Her mother was reading a magazine. As she walked past, Liz glanced at the photos: Japanese gardens covered with little oval pebbles. Liz grinned to herself; she could not wait to see what the future backyard would look like: native Australia bush, the organic vegetable patch, and a Japanese garden.
The large anti-mine protest photo on the front page of the newspaper her father was reading reminded her—during today’s lunchtime, all high school students in the state were going to protest in front of Parliament House. 
‘Are you going to attend the protest today?’ her father asked.
‘Yes, we all are,’ Liz replied.
Henry came downstairs. ‘Why are you up so early? I thought you didn’t want to jog today.’
‘I couldn’t sleep, so I decided I might as well.’ 
‘Would you like me to join you?’ Henry gave her a meaningful look.
She stared at Henry, wondering if he was also invited to the meeting with Li Ping. His expression was a bit strange. He turned a bit towards the kitchen so their parents couldn’t see his hand; a similar note lay in his palm. 
‘Of course you can come,’ said Liz.

The morning breeze caressed Liz’s face, soft and smooth as silk, as they jogged along the river foreshore and up to Kings Park, where they followed the footpaths among the native trees, turning off between thick bushes to reach their secret hideout. Li Ping was there, smiling at them, alongside Sue.
‘How do you feel today?’ asked Liz.
‘Much better. I know you have many questions,’ Li Ping pointed at a large dead log on the ground, ‘so why don’t we sit down and talk through them?’
‘Can you teach me how to fight?’ Henry said even before they sat down.
‘I’d like to know where these monsters came from,’ said Sue.
‘What I’d like to know is what this calligraphy pen really is,’ said Liz.
Li raised a hand. ‘One thing at a time. Shall we start with the calligraphy pen?’ Henry shrugged and Sue nodded. ‘Nobody knows where it is from, or who made it; as long as people can remember, it was always there.’
‘My dad said that it could be the dragon whisker pen that the Four Sea Dragon King gave to the Yellow Emperor on his coronation,’ Henry interrupted.
‘Your father knows that story?’ said Li, ‘I have heard it too. Unfortunately, there is no evidence to verify the legend. However, I would like to show you something. Can I borrow your pen for a moment, please?’
Liz and her friends followed Li to a tree so large that it would take five people holding hands to embrace it. Liz anticipated something special was going to happen. 
Using the calligraphy pen, Li painted a picture of a giant panda on the tree trunk. 
‘It looks so real, almost alive—hang on!’ Liz saw something was wrong with the panda’s eyes. She took a close look. ‘Have you forgotten to paint pupils in the panda’s eyes?’ 
‘No, I haven’t forgotten—or rather, I left them out intentionally. Have you heard the Chinese expression about painting the dragon’s pupils?’
She never paid much attention to the stories her father told her, however she did remember this one. But everyone knew it was just a fairy tale. Suddenly, her eyes became bright.
‘Yes, the story was true.’ Li flicked her wrist gracefully, and two black ink drops flew into the panda’s eyes. 
8
Fast and Slow

Immediately, the panda blinked, moved its paws, and slowly climbed down the tree trunk. Li Ping used the calligraphy pen again, making a few strokes in the air. As the pen moved, a patch of bamboo appeared; the panda started munching the green fresh bamboo leaves. 
It was the first time the three had seen a real giant panda, and everyone watched it with great excitement. Looking at the tree trunk where the painted panda had been, Liz saw a panda-shaped piece of bark missing. Had her pen really transformed the bark into a panda?
 ‘Is this the same calligraphy pen that the painter used to paint the dragon’s pupils in the tale?’ Henry asked. 
Li Ping nodded and passed the calligraphy pen back to Liz. Liz stared at her pen. ‘But how could it be possible that my father bought it at a swap meet in Australia?’
‘I don’t know.’
‘Could you please tell us where those evil monsters came from?’ asked Sue.
‘They escaped from their magic prison after Wave Rock was destroyed by the explosion.’
‘Are you telling us that those monsters were living inside Wave Rock?’ Sue said.
‘Unfortunately I don’t know about the history of the prison and the monsters, but Professor Smith may know something. We could ask him later.’
‘OK, all the questions have been answered, now it’s time to teach me—er, us, combat skills,’ said Henry.
‘Well, in fact, you all have been learning the skills for years.’
‘Do you mean the slow Tai Chi movements can be used in real combat? Is that what you used yesterday?’ asked Henry.
‘I know it’s hard to imagine. Can I borrow your pen please, Liz?’ 
Li made some invisible strokes in the air. Gradually a creek appeared along the forest floor, flowing into an oval pond. Liz watched admiringly as Li painted a smooth-skinned rubber ball floating in the water, and then a long thick bamboo pole. Liz hoped that Li would teach her to use the pen like that. 
 Li passed the pole to Henry. ‘Try to push the ball under water.’
The ball was wet and slippery. Henry’s pole skipped away each time it touched. The more he poked, the faster the ball spun; in the end he had to give up.
‘Rather than head-on confrontation, Tai Chi does not use force against force. Instead, like a spinning ball, it deflects the opponent’s attack.’ Li painted a bamboo basket on the tip of the pole. ‘Now, try it again.’
This time Henry could easily push the ball under. Li told him to push it deeper under water. 
‘It’s getting harder and harder,’ he gasped; soon he couldn’t hold his position any longer, and he lost his balance and almost fell into the water. Li caught him in time. The ball popped out of the water and shot high into the air.
‘If water is stopped by a dam, it will wait patiently, accumulating energy. When it finds the smallest flaw, it will break the dam and burst out unstoppably. Similarly, Tai Chi retreats when its opponent advances, and as the opponent’s force reaches its limit, Tai Chi makes the enemy unbalanced, and then advances in full strength. The stronger the opponent’s attacking force, the stronger the Tai Chi fighting back.’
‘Sounds good, but how do you apply the theory in real combat?’ Henry challenged her.
‘Henry, would you like to step forward? Now punch me as fast and hard as you can.’
Hesitating initially, then without warning, Henry’s right fist punched at Li’s left shoulder, fast; however, as his fist almost touched her, Li twisted her shoulder slightly, just enough for Henry’s fist to miss its target. Her movement was casual, like doing a bit of a stretch.
‘All Tai Chi gestures are circular movements, so the attacking forces can be spun off. Henry, please keep punching.’
Henry used both of his fists to punch at Li continuously. 
Li gracefully twisted, rotated, and moved backwards and forwards. Just before each blow touched Li’s clothes, it landed in a void. Moving around Henry’s punches, Li spoke as if she was strolling in her backyard. 
‘Keep going, Henry. You can kick as well if you are tired of punching.’
Panting heavily, Henry seemed very happy to do some kicking and give his arms a rest. Like a soccer player, his kicks were powerful and fast; again, each kick was unable to touch even the surface of Li’s clothes. 
‘Fast and slow are relative. You have to agree that Henry’s punches and kicks are quite fast.’ Li put her hand up. ‘Henry, punch my palm.’
Henry’s shirt was saturated, as if he had just walked out of a shower. Now Li offered him a fixed target, he was more than happy to do as requested.
Liz watched him gazing at Li’s palm, about an arm’s length from him, and felt his desperation to win this round—a boyish thing, always wanting to win. Then he put all of his might into his right fist. 
As his fist almost touched her palm, instead of moving sideways Li withdrew her hand. Her palm moved backwards at the same speed as Henry’s fist; then she gripped his fist and gave a gentle twist. Henry lost his balance. Li’s right foot caught Henry just before his nose hit the ground. She lifted her foot, throwing him on his feet again. 
Henry used the back of his hand to wipe the sweat off his forehead. ‘Man, that’s cool.’ 
The girls both laughed. 
Liz thought about something: ‘Li, Henry is exhausted after just a couple of minutes of air punching.’ She looked at Henry, and he looked embarrassed when she mentioned ‘air punching’. ‘But you show no sign of tiredness at all, you’re not even panting. Is this to do with the Tai Chi meditation breathing techniques?’
‘Yes, but it’s also because I didn’t directly fight with him, but followed the flow—like strolling in the back garden—so why should I feel tired? Can you tell me what I just demonstrated?’ 
‘Henry’s punch was fast but so was the speed of your palm withdrawing, so Tai Chi is not always slow; it can become faster than the attack force,’ said Sue. Li nodded. ‘Because the speed of withdrawing your palm was the same speed as Henry’s punching, Henry’s fist was still, related to your palm; so you could easily grip his fist. This is what you meant by fast can become slow.’ 
Li applauded. ‘The reason we are doing the slow Tai Chi movements is to enable us to move faster than the fastest attacking force, making it relatively slow. Of course, in order to do that, one has to be extremely sensitive towards the attacking force. Can I please borrow your pen again?’
This time Li painted a Twenty-eight, the green parrot, on a lower tree branch. It looked beautiful and real. ‘OK, let’s paint its pupils.’ 
After Li’s pen touched the bird’s eyes, it turned and flew into the air. Liz only spotted a blur in the air, and the next thing she saw was that the bird stood on Li’s open palm. Then a strange thing happened; the bird made a few attempts to become airborne, but gave up every time. Liz wondered if Li had trapped the bird with magic.
‘Watch the bird carefully—it uses its legs to push off from where it stands, jump in the air, and fly away. I sense the pressure from the bird’s legs, and move my hand backward so it loses its ground; that’s why it is unable to fly.’ 
Li stopped moving her hand and let the bird flew away. ‘You must wonder what the connection between Tai Chi and a bird trapped on my hand is.’
‘I know,’ said Henry. ‘We need to be sensitive towards the attacking force. Whenever we are attacked, we sense the pressure and move backwards, forwards or sidewards to avoid the direct force.’ His face was full of satisfaction.
‘I agree in theory, but it’s not possible for humans to react fast enough to avoid attacks. You should know that, Henry; that’s why the goalkeeper doesn’t have time to react in a penalty shot,’ said Liz.
‘You’re right about human reaction time, but there are two exceptions.’ Li Ping handed the calligraphy pen back to Liz. Liz immediately dropped it on ground as if she had touched a hot iron bar.

Yellow Crane

‘Liz, sorry for the shock, but your hand will be fine.’ Li picked up the pen. ‘When we touch a hot object, our body reacts instantly, without waiting for our brain to process the signals.’
‘What’s the second exception?’ Sue asked.
‘It’s Qi.’ Li pronounced it like the beginning of the word ‘cheese’. When Qi is built up within your body, it forms a protective layer, reacting to foreign force at lightning speed.’
‘What is this Qi?’ asked Sue.
‘Qi can be simply translated as one’s inner energy, but it is far more than that. Sue, can you step forward please? Put your palms against mine.’ 
From the expression on her friend’s face, Liz imagined that something was happening inside Sue; her face was very calm, very relaxed, almost glowing. A couple of minutes later, Li moved away from Sue.
‘Sue, look at the tree branch over there. I want you to chop it off with your hand, like this; in Chinese Gong Fu, it’s called the Palm Knife.’ Li Ping chopped the air with her palm vertically.
‘What? Are you serious?’ Sue stared at her hand, and then at the thick tree branch. 
‘Go on, Sue, you can do it,’ said Henry.
‘Why don’t you try it gently first to see if it hurts your hand?’ said Liz.
Sue looked at Li Ping, and walked towards the branch slowly. 
It was thick and covered with dark rough bark. It would be very hard to chop it off even with an axe. Liz watched wood chopping competitions at the Perth Royal Show; this was not much thinner than the logs used in the Show.
Sue put her right hand in a vertical position, looked at Li Ping once more, and struck gently at the tree branch. 
Nothing happened, but Liz noticed that Sue’s worried expression disappeared; she looked more confident and chopped the tree branch a bit harder. It shook a bit, but didn’t snap.
‘Come on, Sue, harder.’ Henry looked excited.
Sue raised her hand high and chopped at the tree branch with all her might. With a cracking sound, the dinner-plate sized branch fell neatly off the tree. Sue stared at her hand speechless.
Henry clapped, whistled and cheered. Liz gave her a huge hug. ‘Well done, Sue’. She picked up Sue’s right hand and examined it closely: a delicate, pretty girl’s hand, no bruise, no blood, and not even a dusty mark, as if her hand hadn’t touched the tree branch at all. ‘How is this possible? What kind of magic did you put on Sue?’ 
‘It’s no magic; quite simple, actually. I injected Qi into Sue’s body, and she used the Qi to chop the branch off.’ 
‘Do you mean that Qi created an air cushion between Sue’s hand and the tree branch?’ asked Henry.
‘I don’t know if it’s the perfect description, but it’ll do for now.’
‘Was Qi enabling you to fly during your fight with the monsters?’ said Henry.
‘Unfortunately I haven’t reached the flying state yet. However, Qi can help you to defeat the earth’s gravity, so you can jump much higher and run much faster.’
‘So now I’m sure that you used Qi to shoot the green beams and injure the Vampire King,’ said Henry. ‘Why didn’t you use your Qi to kill all the monsters from the beginning?’  
‘There are limitations in terms of how much one can use Qi to attack others, just as you are unable to keep punching without some rest.’
‘If Qi is so powerful, why do we need to learn Tai Chi at all?’ said Sue.
‘Tai Chi is the Yin part, and Qi is the Yang part of Tao. We’ll need to use Tai Chi to avoid an enemy’s attacking force, and use Qi to attack our enemy; only when one’s Yin Yang forces are in harmony can one gain a high level of Tao power.’

Liz, Henry and Sue met again in Kings Park, but Li hadn’t arrived yet. Henry lay on the ground, staring into the tree above him. ‘How long since we started our combat Tai Chi lessons? I’d say three years by now. Li always told us that she’d teach us Far Shu, but how long do we have to wait?’
‘Henry, I don’t think that you should complain. Think how much we’ve learnt,’ said Liz.
‘It’d be fun to know some Far Shu (Chinese words similar to spell and curses), like that sword with the green light Li used to injure the Vampire King,’ said Sue.
‘I’m sure Li’ll teach us when she thinks the time is right,’ said Liz.
‘That’s what we are going to do today.’ 
They all looked up; Li stood on the tree branch above them, just like the time she appeared when they were captured by the monsters; but this time she wore a black top, black trousers and white cape. She jumped off the tree branch, flying through air like a white butterfly, and landed soundlessly. Liz would say Li was just like a big cat, except she was much more agile and fast than any cat in this world.
‘I’ve been in the tree since you arrived. Henry, you lay on the ground but didn’t see me.’
Henry looked embarrassed. ‘No one would expect someone up there.’
‘The first thing about learning offence is learning defence. Whenever and wherever you are, keep your eyes open. Your enemy could be anywhere and in any form, and they won’t formally announce they are coming, or wait for you to get ready.’
‘How do we manage to do that?’ Sue asked.
‘It’s a habit that takes a long time to form. You just have to practise it all the time so you are gradually able to do it automatically, like second nature…’
‘Are you all right?’ Liz saw Li’s face turn pale.
‘I don’t feel very well.’ Li suddenly threw up a mouthful of blood. She took a white handkerchief, wiping her mouth. ‘I underestimated my internal injury from fighting the monsters.’ She threw up more blood. Liz helped her sit on the ground.
‘Liz, I need your pen...’ 
Liz passed it to her. Li struggled to paint a giant crane on the ground. 
It was fascinating to watch the crane’s body gradually materialise. It was the same type of crane Liz had received from Li that morning, although of course this one was much bigger. 
The giant crane stood up and made a loud cry as soon as Li painted its pupils. Li gave the pen back to Liz. ‘Could you please help me up on to the crane? Thanks. There are many dangers and challenges ahead of you... I’m sorry I can help you no longer...’ 
She suddenly fell forwards, but managed to use her arms to hold tightly to the crane’s neck. With a loud cry, the crane carried Li high into the sky. Within seconds they melted into the white clouds. 
Looking at the white clouds floating across the endless blue sky, Liz felt tears flowing down her cheeks. She remembered the Chinese poem Li had told her about the yellow crane:
Gone the immortal, on yellow crane riding,
Since then, empty is the Yellow Crane Building;
After departing, the yellow crane will never return,
Only the white clouds, a thousand years floating, accompany me.

‘I want to fly on the crane, too. The crane...’ Liz cried out.
‘What crane?’ Liz’s mother stood in front of her bed. ‘Why are you crying?’
Liz wiped her eyes. ‘Have I been sleeping? What year is this? How long have I been asleep?’ She sat up.
‘Are you all right? You must be very tired from the picnic yesterday,’ said her mother soothingly.
‘The picnic, the one where we went to the lake, just after my 14th birthday?’
‘Yes. Don’t you even remember your own birthday? You’d better hurry up if you want to get to school on time and attend that protest.’ Liz’s mother turned towards the door.
‘Mum,’ Liz suddenly called.
‘Yes?’
‘I love you, Mum. I feel like I haven’t seen you for years.’ 
‘I love you too, sweetie.’ Liz’s mother left the room.

The Letter

Too many thoughts jammed up Liz’s brain; she stared at the large giant panda poster on the opposite wall, not knowing where to start. Then she thought about her calligraphy pen. Looking around her bedroom, she saw her jacket on the floor. Liz jumped out of her bed, not even noticing that she landed on the floor as soundlessly as a cat. Picking up her jacket and fumbling inside the pockets, she found the pen; its bamboo shaft was sparkling.
Although unable to remember anything about how to paint animals and turn them alive, maybe she had learnt something from the dream. She touched the pen to the wall. Nothing. She pushed it harder. Still nothing, even not a faint mark. 
What a shame; it was just a dream. Holding her pen with her eyes closed, she tried to relive her lovely dream; she and her friends had had such a good time, and learnt so much from Li.
Li Ping! 
Had Li recovered from her injury? Now Liz was really glad that what happened to Li in her dream was just a dream. She had to visit her. Glancing at the clock on her bedside table, she quickly scrambled out of her panda-bear pyjamas, dressed, and rushed downstairs. 
If she hadn’t put her hand over her mouth in time, she would have cried out: downstairs in the living area, her parents sat in exactly the same positions as in her dream. She wondered if she was still asleep. 
As she slowly passed her mother reading the gardening magazine and her father holding the newspaper with the mining protest photo on the front page, Liz heard her father say, ‘Are you going to attend the protest today?’ 
‘Yes, we all are.’ Her parents stared at her in amazement. ‘Did I say something wrong? Why are you staring me like that?’ 
‘Do you realise you’re speaking Mandarin?’ asked Henry, coming downstairs.
‘What? Am I?’ she said, startled.
‘I didn’t know that you could speak such good Mandarin,’ said her father.
Henry’s expression was a bit strange. He opened his mouth, hesitated, and then whispered, ‘Last night I had a weird dream…’
‘Hurry up; we need to go in a minute.’ She winked at him. He nodded.
‘Liz, here’s a letter from Li Ping. I found it in our letter box this morning,’ said her father.
There was neither an address nor stamp on it. ‘To Liz’ and ‘From Li Ping’ were written on the envelope. Liz didn’t open it. 

When they arrived at their secret spot, Sue was already there. Liz and Henry had run so fast that both of them were out of breath. By now, Liz was sure that she was no longer in a dream (however, from this moment onwards, Liz would refer to this weird dream as the long dream). This was reality. When she saw the expressions on Henry’s and Sue’s faces, she knew that they thought the same thing. She flopped down and got her breath back. ‘I had a very weird dream last night.’ 
‘Me too,’ said Sue.
‘Me three,’ said Henry.
‘I suppose we all dreamed about the same things,’ said Liz.
‘Tell us what happened in your dream,’ said Sue.
‘Why don’t you open Li’s letter?’ 
‘A letter from Li Ping?’ asked Sue.
Taking it out and opening it, Liz found a paper crane inside the envelope.
‘It’s the crane from my dream,’ exclaimed Henry and Sue at the same time. Liz put the crane on her palm, and they all stared at it. 
Blinking its eyes, the paper crane stood up, looked around as if greeting everyone, and then pushed its legs against Liz’s hand. Liz’s hand automatically moved downwards; the paper crane lost its support and failed to launch.
‘Wow, I can’t believe you can actually do that—I thought it was just a weird dream!’ Sue stared wide-eyed at the cross little bird.
‘We don’t have time for this. Let it fly,’ demanded Henry. Liz held her hand steady. Flapping its wings gracefully, the paper crane flew in beautiful curves around her shoulders, and then away. It circled back and flew ahead of them again.
‘I think we’re meant to follow it.’ The three leapt to their feet and gave chase.
A few hundred metres later, the crane circled a large tree until Liz and her friends arrived, and then glided towards Liz. As soon as it landed on her palm, it collapsed, unfolding into a letter from Li addressed to all three of them. 
After reading it silently for a few seconds, Liz put her hand into the hole in the tree trunk, taking out two items. She passed a black leather belt to Henry and a golden bangle to Sue. 
‘I knew Li would give her belt sword to me. Oh no, I can’t withdraw my sword. What’s wrong with it?’ Henry yanked fiercely, but without success.
‘I can’t activate my Yin Yang Ring either. Can you use your dragon whisker whip?’ asked Sue.
Taking her pen out, Liz shook her wrist a couple of times, but nothing happened.
‘What does Li say in her letter?’ asked Henry.
Liz read aloud: ‘You may already have figured out that what happened to you was not just a dream. Overnight you all have had three years of intense Tai Chi combat training, a special Far Shu, but you’ll only be able to keep your power under one condition.’ Liz paused, glancing at Sue and Henry, then continued. ‘The condition is that nobody must ever know about the dream or the events that happened on the previous day; otherwise, you will lose not only everything you gained from the dream, but also possibly some of your own memories as well. I have left you three masks that will help you to disguise yourselves during your actions.’
‘Where are the masks?’ Henry put his hand inside the tree hole, searched for a while, and shook his head. 
‘The first three pages in the diary are your emergency help pages. They should only be used in life and death situations,’ Liz continued to read the letter.
‘Where’s the diary? We haven’t even found the masks yet,’ said Henry.
‘I injured the Vampire King, but the monsters will come out soon. I estimate that at the most you have a week to get ready …’ Liz kept reading.
‘To get ready for what?’ asked Henry.
‘I don’t know. The letter stopped,’ Liz replied.
‘Let me have a look,’ Henry snatched the piece of paper from Liz’s hand, turning it over, holding it against the light, even reading it upside down. ‘I guess Li suddenly fell ill and wasn’t able to finish the letter, just like in our dream.’
‘I think you’re right,’ said Liz.
‘Where could Li be now?’ Sue looked worried.
‘I suspect she passed away,’ said Liz.
‘Do you mean she’s dead?’ said Henry. ‘How could she be? She’s magic, and in the dream she flew away to search for a cure.’
‘Flying away on a magic crane is a Chinese way to say someone has become immortal; in other words, it means Li died,’ said Liz.
‘Let me get this right,’ said Henry slowly. ‘Li is the only one we know who could beat the monsters, but she could be dead according to your interpretation. Thousands of ancient evil monsters are on the loose somewhere in the country, and could appear at any moment. We’re supposed to get a magic weapon each, but none of them works…’ He slumped on the ground against the tree trunk.
‘Maybe we should inform the government about the monsters,’ said Sue.
‘Nobody would believe us; besides, if we talk about what happened, we’ll lose our memory; so we wouldn’t be able to tell anybody. It’s like a catch twenty-two. We’re trapped. It’s like waking up in the middle of the night and finding monsters everywhere, but we can’t wake up the others…’ said Henry.
Sue sat beside him. ‘It shouldn’t be that bad. Surely, something must happen, or someone must come up with a way to save the world.’ 
‘Sue, I don’t know if these monsters will destroy the whole human world or if someone will eventually destroy them, but one thing is sure— people in Western Australia are in danger. Many of them will be killed before any help comes. We were lucky Li saved us. I wish I didn’t know about this, and then at least I’d have less time to worry about it,’ said Henry.
Liz knew Henry was right. She and her friends, by chance or by fate, had stumbled onto something so big that it was beyond their ability to handle it. Li’s intention to empower them overnight had been well meant, but her unexpected departure left them facing thousands of monsters alone and poorly prepared— even worse, because of the special Far Shu, they could not even tell anybody about the danger, let alone ask for help. 
‘Are you telling me that there’s no hope for us?’ Sue waited but nobody answered her question. ‘I want to become a fashion model… I don’t want to die…’ she sniffled.
‘Sue, the monsters haven’t come out yet.’ Sitting beside Sue, Liz put her arm around her shoulder. ‘We still have time to work things out— hang on; I remember Li mentioned Professor Smith might know something about the monsters.’
‘Yes, Li did say that, when I asked where the monsters were from.’ Sue stopped sniffling.
‘So that means that we should be able to talk to Professor Smith about the monsters,’ said Liz.
‘What are we waiting for?’ Henry asked, leaping to his feet. ‘Let’s go!’

The Charging Horse

The door of Professor Smith’s home was open. Seeing nobody around, Liz walked inside. Henry and Sue followed. It was messy; papers were everywhere; drawers were upside down on the floor. 
‘What happened? A break in?’ said Henry.
‘No. Otherwise the camera and laptop would be taken.’ Liz looked at her watch. 
Sue gasped. ‘I almost forgot. We have to attend the protest in Perth city.’
‘It’s only 11.30, so we should be able to make it; fortunately, it’s not far from here to the city,’ said Liz.
‘What are you talking about?’ demanded Henry. ‘We don’t have time to attend a protest. Evil monsters may be out at any moment, eating everyone in the city. What’s the point of protesting against a mine project?’
‘Here’s the point!’ Liz pointed to a photo stuck on the fridge with a magnet: against the background of Uluru, Professor Smith stood shoulder to shoulder with an Aboriginal elder.
‘Are you telling me Mr Dingo will be in the city today?’ said Henry.
‘Mr Dingo’s very active in environmental protection. He was at Wave Rock, and I can’t see why he’d miss today’s protest against the mine project,’ said Liz.
‘And Mr Dingo may be able to tell where the professor is,’ added Sue.
‘OK, if that’s the case, we’d better hurry.’ Henry was first out the door.

Liz, Henry and Sue walked down Murray Street Mall. Under the veranda of an old building, an old man with a shiny suit sang and danced, accompanied by blue jazz. Two blocks away, under the overhead footbridge, a musician took turn playing dozens of musical instruments including a didgeridoo; next to him was a pile of CDs for sale. Down the street, a short topless man with black skeleton tattoos was doing a sword-swallowing performance, attracting a large crowd of people. Around the corner, using coloured pencils, a female artist was in the slow process of finishing a huge fairy tale picture. Spreads around her were finished drawings. Liz saw a few police officers standing along the street.
So peaceful. These people had no idea what kind of danger lay ahead of them. Liz walked a bit faster; they must find Professor Smith. He was their only hope to save these innocent lives.
When she and her friends arrived in front of Parliament House, the protest had already started. Holding a loudspeaker, Fred spoke to thousands of high school students who were enthusiastically following his speech, cheering, shouting, and whistling. Gazing at Fred’s handsome face and listening to his inspiring words, Liz understood why so many girls were attracted to him. He had a charisma not many girls could resist.
‘Liz!’ Henry tugged her sleeve.
‘What?’
‘I can’t see Professor Smith or Mr Dingo, can you?’ asked Henry.
‘No.’ Liz tore her gaze away from Fred.
‘What should we do now?’ asked Henry.
Liz looked at the crowd and then Fred. ‘We join the protest.’
‘Are you crazy? We don’t have time. Remember— the monsters?’ said Henry.
‘Shhh, don’t mention it in public. I’m fully aware how dangerous our situation is, but I think we should still join the protest,’ said Liz.
Henry looked at Fred for a second. ‘If Fred wasn’t here, would we still participate in the protest?’
Liz blushed. ‘Henry, this is nothing to do with whether Fred is here or not. Remember that we only have ten years to reverse the greenhouse effect. Protest against the mine is as important as fighting the monsters for our survival. You know what I stand for. I can’t believe you said that…’
‘I’m sorry; the words just came out. But I still don’t think that we should waste time on the protest. Global warming is bad, but we have ten years to combat it. If we don’t find a solution to the… the other problem we’ve got, these people will be dead by tomorrow, and what’s the point of a clean environment if everyone is dead?’
‘But we may be able to find Professor Smith or Mr Dingo during the protest; besides, what else can we do? We’ve got no other option but finding Professor Smith,’ Sue said.
The speech was over. Fred walked in front of the parade, followed by two big football players holding a large banner saying ‘No more destroying our environment’. Thousands of high school students poured their energy into cheering and chanting as the long parade waved its way through the city.
‘All right, let’s see what happens,’ Henry said reluctantly.
‘Come on join in,’ Liz urged as Fred’s parade passed the three of them. They had to force their way into the parade.
Liz walked just one step behind Fred. Sue and Henry followed. Fred turned around, looked at Liz, and smiled. Liz smiled back happily. She was not sure if Fred was smiling at her or at Sue. She didn’t really care.

All the entrances to the main street were blocked off by police. Office workers stood along the street watching the parade; this was much more interesting than their boring office jobs. Horse-mounted police officers appeared, riding alongside the parade. When it turned on to Barrack Street, dozens more police on large horses blocked the way. The horses were enormous. Liz reckoned that their backs were higher than her head.
Fred stopped in front of the police horses. 
‘The parade is not allowed to go to Forrest Chase,’ said an officer.
As the news spread, the students behind became agitated, and a few dozen started to force their way ahead. Liz recognised them as part of the Animal Rights Party, famous for their bold actions. 
The police officers on horseback ordered them back.
Somewhere, glass shattered. Liz turned around and saw a few car windscreens had been smashed. She saw a group of students kick at shop windows, and more glass-shattering noises filled the air. She didn’t recognise the students; maybe they were from one of the tough neighbourhoods in the northern suburbs. 
A water bottle flew from the crowd, smashing into the nose of the officer in charge. He was knocked off his horse, crashing to the ground. Sitting up, with one hand holding his nose, he waved.
‘Charge!’
Without waiting, a large black horse charged straight at Fred. His mouth opened wide, but there was no room for him to get out of the way. In seconds the horse would trample him. Liz watched in horror as the hooves clattered nearer and Fred remained frozen in shock and fear. There was no escape. 
12
Aboriginal Dance

Acting automatically, with a single leap Liz covered the five metres between her and Fred, positioned herself in front of him and faced the beast. She hooked her hand under his arm, leapt mightily, and they both fell onto the footpath. 
‘Sorry for knocking you over— I was too panicky,’ Liz blurted out.
Fred blinked and focused on Liz’s face. ‘Are you OK?’ 
‘Thanks, I’m totally fine.’ 
Standing up, Fred reached his hand to Liz, pulling her up.
Fred held her hand! As if lightning struck, a warm current fizzed from her hand straight into her heart. Liz felt she would never be happier. Gazing at Fred’s handsome face, she promised that she would do whatever it took to protect him and all her beloved ones from the monsters. 
Screaming and the sounds of hoofs hitting the ground mixed into a chaotic symphony. More and more police officers appeared; some students were dragged into police vans. In the chaos, Fred was lost among the crowd and disappeared; the protest was over. Liz signalled Sue and Henry to follow her, and together they walked towards the city centre. 
As they turned the corner, Liz saw two homeless men walk slowly towards Kings Park. They looked a bit strange; they had wrapped their heads in large dirty rags so only their eyes were visible. She was about to mention them to Henry and Sue when something more important caught her eye. Under fluttering Aboriginal flags and anti-mining banners, a group of people were dancing accompanied by the heavy drone of didgeridoo music. An elderly man stood on one leg, watching.
‘Come on, join the dance,’ Liz ordered. Stamping their feet, shaking their hands, arms and shoulders, she and her friends joined in. More students followed. The dancing crowd expanded rapidly. Liz led the way round to the old man.
‘Mr Dingo, do you remember me?’ she asked as she danced around the elder.
‘No, I don’t.’
‘You taught us Aboriginal dance at our school recently, Kings College.’
‘I remember Kings College but I can’t remember every student.’
‘We also met on other occasions. I’m a member of EPP.’
‘Yes, I remember now. You were with Fred one time, but I don’t remember your name.’
‘That doesn’t matter. Mr Dingo, something isn’t right, and I need to talk to Professor Smith urgently. Can you help me?’
Mr Dingo looked around and then said quietly. ‘Someone is trying to kill him and he is hiding.’
‘What? Who is trying to kill him?’ Liz stood still in shock.
‘Don’t know. If you want to talk to him, go and wait under the Narrows Bridge at midnight tonight. I’m not sure if he’ll be there, but it’s worth trying. He was going to meet me there last night but he didn’t show up,’ Mr Dingo was looking worried. A large group of police was approaching the dancing group. ‘Say hello to the Professor for me,’ he called as he led his dancers towards the police. Soon their dancing sticks became weapons against the police batons. Screaming, shouting, and ambulance sirens became too much to bear. Liz, Henry and Sue disappeared into the crowd of bystanders. 

‘I still feel bad that we didn’t stay and join the fight with Mr Dingo,’ said Henry.
It was a few hours later in Liz’s bedroom. She had organised for Sue to sleep over so they could go out together later. ‘We have more important issues to deal with. You said that yourself earlier; you didn’t even want to join the protest.’
‘I know. I just wonder if Mr Dingo will be all right,’ said Henry.
‘He’ll be OK.’ Liz sat on her bed, took out the letter from Li, and stared at it.
‘What are you trying to find out? Haven’t we already read it a hundred times?’ said Sue.
‘I don’t know; so many things don’t make sense— if Li has time to teach us Tai Chi for three years, why can’t she tell us what happened to her?’
‘She may not be able to tell us anything in the dream. She could have been attacked while writing the letter. Do you think the people trying to kill the Professor also attacked Li?’
‘I don’t think so. Li is far too powerful for ordinary people. Remember she was fighting thousands of evil monsters.’
Liz took out her pen. ‘I know it’s a magic pen, but I just haven’t had much luck with it. I wish Li had had a bit more time so she could have taught me how to use it.’ She made a few strokes on the piece of paper, and then suddenly shouted. ‘Look what’s happening!’ 
They were all stunned, watching what happened in front of their eyes; the piece of paper curved and wrinkled as if it was being burnt by an invisible fire. A few seconds later, it stopped, but it was no longer a piece of paper— it had turned into a palm-sized diary.
‘It’s the diary Li mentioned in her letter.’
‘Why didn’t Li give it to us in the first place? If Liz hadn’t touched it with her pen, we’d never have found out the secret.’
‘It could be a precaution to prevent it falling into the wrong hands. Let’s have a look what’s inside.’ Liz opened the diary. It was blank; turning to the second page, she found it was blank, too. ‘So the first three blank pages are the emergency help pages.’
‘Let’s hope we don’t need any emergency help, then,’ growled Henry.
In between the next few pages, Liz found three masks the size of her palm. She spent a few minutes reading the Chinese words in the diary, and then she said. ‘Watch my face carefully.’ Her hand quickly stroked over her face. 
Henry and Sue couldn’t help gasping; in front of them, an Asian girl smiled at them shyly. ‘Me no spoke English good.’
‘Wow, that’s incredible!’
‘Can I try your mask?’
‘We have a mask each— and there’s more!’ Liz stroked her face again from her chin to her forehead. To her friends’ surprise, this time she transformed herself into Li Ping. ‘There are a few layers in our magic masks.’ 
‘Wow! Where’s mine?’ Henry reached for the diary, and Sue tussled him for it. 
‘I want to see what I’ve got. Do you think there’s one that would make me look like Anna Sinkovska?’
‘Who?’ Henry found his mask and smoothed it on. ‘What do I look like?’
‘Your science teacher. Quick, change it! What about me?’ Sue pranced, hand on her hip.
‘My grandfather before he shaved his beard off…’
They had a lot of fun trying on their masks until almost midnight. 
‘Should we tell Mum what we’re going to do?’ Liz said.
‘Are you crazy? Do you want to lose our new found power and memory?’ Henry almost shouted.
‘Shush, Henry. Liz, your mother will understand one day.’
‘I know. I just feel as if I’m going to do something wrong, sort of guilty.’ Liz raised her hand before Henry opened his mouth. ‘OK, let’s get out as quietly as we can, with masks on.’ She opened her window and climbed out. Henry and Sue followed.
They walked silently on the soft grass along the South Perth foreshore. Occasionally Liz turned and looked at Sue and Henry. Sue’s blond hair had changed into an Irish girl’s red hair, and Henry was a blond surfing boy. Liz knew she had an Asian girl’s black hair. How could the masks change their hair colour? She couldn’t believe how much her life had changed in the last two days; she and her family had gone to enjoy a sunny winter picnic yesterday, and now she was walking along the foreshore at midnight to meet a professor about evil monsters. 

The Narrows Bridge was not really narrow. The name referred to its location, the narrowest point of the Swan River. In fact, the bridge was quite wide: apart from a four-lane highway in each direction, there was also a railway track down the middle. The three peered into the shadows under the bridge, illuminated by pale lights on both sides. Nobody was to be seen. 
‘What are we going to do now?’
Liz looked at her watch: just a few minutes past midnight. ‘We wait.’
Henry fumbled with his new belt and paced backward and forward. ‘Who do you think is trying to kill Professor Smith?’
‘I don’t think it’s the monsters we encountered yesterday.’
‘I suppose you’re right, because the monsters wouldn’t know who the Professor is. But who else would have a motive to kill him?’
‘We’ll know the answer when the Professor turns up.’
‘That assumes he will turn up.’
‘Relax, will you, Henry? We’ve only been here five minutes.’
‘Let’s assume that it’s somehow related to the evil monsters, so there’s a good chance we may need to combat them tonight. I wish I could use my sword,’ Henry murmured to himself while marching backward and forward. He held the buckle of the belt. ‘I saw Li do this in the dream, just like this, to withdraw the magic sword. Wow— look what I’ve got here!’
A green sword gleamed in Henry’s hand.
‘Could I please have a look?’ Liz said. Henry gave an experimental swipe or two and passed it over reluctantly. It was about five feet long and two inches wide. Liz was unable to tell what kind of material it was made of, but it felt quite light and soft. She shook her wrist, and it made a pleasant humming. It seemed that the belt’s buckle had transformed into the sword’s hilt. It was decorated with a tiger’s body, and the sword grew out of the tiger’s mouth. In the background of the tiger-striped leathery hilt, two green eyes glowed in the dark. 
Liz passed the belt sword to Sue, who turned to Henry. ‘How did you withdraw it?’
‘I just did it, pulled it out.’
‘Can you put it back in the belt?’ After a brief examination, Sue gingerly handed the sword back to Henry.
Henry made a series of Tai Chi sword movements; interwoven green circles appeared in the air. Turning it around, he thrust it back into the belt. Like an icicle melting, it dissolved and became a normal black belt again.
‘What a magic belt sword! I wonder if my weapon will suddenly work.’ Sue took her bangle off, throwing it in the air. It spun and grew while making beautiful curves. When it glided back to her hand, it had grown three feet in diameter and shone with golden fire. She gripped the rim of the ring lightly; when her hands rose again, she had a ring in each; one was the original gold and the other glittered silver. ‘Ladies and Gentlemen, the Yin Yang Ring.’ 
‘It looks beautiful.’ After Sue had shrunk the ring back to a bangle again, Liz examined it closely; although its surface was badly worn, Liz could recognise a golden phoenix curved around its rim. 
‘Liz, try your weapon.’
Taking out her pen and shaking her wrist, Liz saw the brush of her pen suddenly grow longer and thicker, growing fast, like a jet of dark blue water shooting from a hose. In a split second, it grew nine metres long and thick as a tennis ball, a whip emitting rainbow sparkles. As if it was the ribbon in her gymnastics class, Liz shook her wrist, and rainbow loops and circles glittered in mid-air. ‘Ladies and Gentlemen, the dragon whisker whip.’
‘It’s great that our weapons work. Any idea why?’
Shaking her whip into a pen again, Liz thought for a while. ‘I think it has something to do with the magic masks.’
‘Are you telling me that if we take off our masks, our weapons won’t work anymore? I want to try it.’ Henry reached for his mask.
‘It won’t be necessary.’ A voice came from behind one of bridge’s huge pillars.

Professors 

Everyone turned around. A white-haired old man walked out from the shadow of a huge pillar. As he drew closer, Liz shouted, ‘Professor Smith, we’re …’
Professor Smith raised his hand. ‘Don’t tell me who you are; and don’t show anybody your real faces. I’ve been watching you since you arrived. You need to be more alert.’
‘Yes, Professor.’ Liz felt her face became hot.
‘I’m convinced you’re somehow related to Li Ping. Don’t tell me anything more— that’s good enough for me to trust you. Now listen to me very carefully…’ Professor Smith suddenly stopped, turning around. A group of black-cloaked figures emerged from shadows of the pillars. 
‘Professor Smith?’ asked the leading figure. 
‘Yes? Who are you?’
‘We are colleagues of Professor Brown in London. Let me introduce everyone to you.’ He spoke with a strong French accent. ‘I’m Dr Blanc; my specialty is ancient witchcraft; this is Dr Wolfgang, and his field is …’
‘Sorry for interrupting you, Dr Blanc.’ Professor Smith scanned the surroundings. ‘This is very important; how did you know to find me here?’
‘Quite simple— we traced you by following your Northern Star. I have to admit that Professor Brown told me about it…’
‘Oh, no, how could I not think about it earlier?’ Professor Smith used his fists to hit his head repeatedly.
‘What’s wrong, Professor?’
‘Dr Blanc, the situation here is much more complicated than we thought; we are not only dealing with thousands of monsters…’
‘That is what we are here for. We’ll look after you. Let me show you one of my French charms. Look at the rock over there.’ After a few rapid words, Dr Blanc swished a wand, and a pale green spark shot out, hitting a desk-size rock twenty metres away; it exploded.
‘It’s great, Dr Blanc, but I need to tell you about…’
‘Obviously you have not been convinced by the power of my wand. Dr Wolfgang, could you please cast one of your famous German spells?’
‘As you wish.’ Speaking a series of German words, Dr Wolfgang’s wand emitted a pale-blue spark, striking on a tree thirty metres away; the tree burst into flames. ‘My mistake!’ Dr Wolfgang mumbled a few more words and the fire was extinguished.
‘Thank you both so much for your demonstrations. Believe me, I do not doubt your power and ability to suppress and kill evil monsters; however, what we’re dealing with is far more dangerous than that.’ Professor Smith stopped abruptly, turning around, and shouted, ‘Who’s there?’
Liz saw nobody at first; then figures emerged from behind the huge pillars. The first shadow walked to the light: a vampire with long shiny fangs. He was carrying a torch and wearing a backpack. The group behind him all looked like him. Each had a torch and a backpack. 
‘Professor, leave them to us. Comrades, deploy your wands.’ Dr Blanc and his black-cloaked people spread out, wands drawn, and faced the vampires.
‘Dr Blanc, they are not vampires…’ Professor Smith’s voice was drowned by Dr Blanc and his comrades’ shouting; casting spells or charms, Liz assumed. 
In slick synchronised movements, the backpack vampires raised their torches, shooting out showers of red sparks. Dr Blanc and his comrades were cut to the ground one after another; most of them hadn’t managed to cast any spells. A few pale blue and green sparks from Blanc’s and Wolfgang’s wands did hit their targets but bounced off, dropping into the river and creating giant bubbles.
Professor Smith was in his seventies. Even so, in a split second he took out a short wooden stick and with a swift slash shot out a bright blue spark. The vampire leader reacted fast, ducking sideward and avoiding the spark. Still in the air, he fired a red spark straight at the Professor’s chest. 
Leaping forward, Liz cracked her dragon whisker whip. It flashed out; a dark blue jet with rainbow sparks, shooting at the vampire leader. He ducked again; the tip of the whip narrowly passed his body.
‘Don’t kill them, I want all three alive!’ The vampire leader shook his hand, and his torch-like object grew into a five foot long sword. Taking fast strides, he advanced on Liz.
As Liz’s whip flew out, Henry’s sword jumped out of his belt. Leaping forward, he bounced away the vampires’ swords. Then he heard Sue scream. Spinning around, he saw three vampires running toward Sue. She covered her face with her hands and screamed. Leaping back, Henry was just in time to block the vampires. With one hand he grabbed Sue’s arm, with the other he made a series of circles with his sword; the vampires were forced back. Sue’s face was pale and her eyes were full of terror. 
Liz heard Sue’s scream but was unable to help; the vampire leader was only feet away. In that short distance, her long whip was almost useless; she had to use the handle to block his thrusting sword. More than once, the sword missed her skin by only a finger’s width. At first she was panic-stricken: how could three kids hold off a bunch of vampires? But as she twisted and curled to avoid the sword’s deadly thrusts and slashes, she gradually calmed down. This was her first time in real combat, and she needed time to apply what she had learnt in practice.
She glanced back and saw that Henry was protecting Sue. Suddenly diving sideways, Liz flew towards the water. Still in the air, she twisted her wrist; her whip flipped straight at the vampire leader’s face, knocking him down. It wrapped around another vampire’s leg. Twitching her arm, Liz dragged the vampire to the ground; meanwhile, her body made a curve in the air above the water, and she landed on the riverbank twenty feet away from the group of vampires.
The vampire leader rose. Liz’s whip had made a long, deep cut down his face, and blood flowed down his cheek. He raised his hand, gripped the cut, and pulled. To Liz’s amazement, he pulled off a mask. He didn’t look like a vampire at all, now; rather he seemed a man in his late twenties. 
Liz didn’t have time to think about this. Being the right distance away from her enemy, her whip was operating at maximum power. It whistled, wiggled, danced and made hundreds and thousands of interwoven loops. Two vampires were whipped into the air and fell crashing down to ground. 
Bang! 
Black smoke burst among the vampires, and more explosions deafened her. The area filled with heavy fog-like black smoke. Liz heard a vampire shout that someone was on top of the bridge. She heard some thuds. It seemed that a few more vampires were down. Then came screams, human screams. 
Relying on her memory, Liz withdrew towards Henry and Sue. Tripping on a body, she made a side-tumble, just avoiding falling down. A weak voice came to her ears. ‘Listen to me carefully.’ It was Professor Smith. 
‘Yes, Professor, it’s me.’
‘One nine eight …nine four …one seven two…one four five. Remember, and go now. Don’t call the police…don’t tell anyone…’ His voice died.
‘Liz, where are you?’ 
Wiping her tears, Liz leapt forward, gripping Henry and Sue. ‘Let’s go.’ 
Under cover of the heavy smoke, she and her friends disappeared.

Internet Café

The rising howl of sirens and the flashing lights of an ambulance told Liz something was wrong. It was coming towards her home. 
‘Quick, into our bedrooms and into pyjamas.’ They hurried over the fence and sneaked inside the house through the window they had left open a few hours ago.
Liz had hardly put on her pyjamas when her mother knocked on her door. ‘What’s happened, Mum? So much noise!’ Liz tried to sound like she had just woken.
‘Your father fell down the stairs …’
‘Is he all right?’ Liz rushed towards the stairs but her mother reached out and grabbed her, stopping her from racing downstairs. 
‘He’s unconscious but still breathing. Don’t panic! I want the three of you to stay here, and I’ll ring you from hospital.’ Her mother rushed downstairs. From the noise below, Liz knew the ambulance had arrived. 
‘What happened to Dad?’ Henry poked his head round Liz’s door. 
Liz told him. She heard her mother open the front door and people tramp in; a few minutes later, the front door closed. Everything became quiet again.
‘What are we going to do now?’ Sue asked.
‘No much, except wait for Mum to call.’ Liz walked downstairs and sat on the sofa. Henry and Sue followed.
‘What were those backpack things? I still can’t believe that— they killed dozens of professors, just like that!’ Henry snapped his fingers.
‘I felt guilty about what happened; if we hadn’t been there to meet Professor Smith, he and the others might be still alive,’ Liz said in a low voice.
‘That’s why we should stay and fight to avenge their deaths,’ Henry said.
‘It’s my fault. I’m so useless, only able to scream.’ Sue paused, and then held up her torn top. ‘What a pity! Do you know that it’s the latest fashion?’
‘It’s terrible, so many deaths…’ Liz was unable to complete her sentence. There was a long silence, and then, ‘Do you have any idea who was on the bridge and saved us?’ said Sue.
‘I thought it was Li Ping at first, but that doesn’t make any sense,’ Liz sighed. ‘I have no idea.’ She remembered the numbers that Professor Smith had given her, so she told Henry and Sue. 
‘Could they be bank safe numbers?’
‘Henry, you read too many mystery books. They could be a phone number, maybe a mobile phone number. Let me write down the numbers: one nine eight …nine four …one seven two…one four five, and that’s it.’ Liz stared at the number in front of her.
‘Well, it doesn’t look like a mobile phone number.’
‘Or a bank safe number.’
‘What are the other possibilities? I wish we had a codebook.’
‘We could always search the internet…’
‘I’ve got it!’ Henry jumped up, turning on the PC on the nearby desk.
‘What are you doing?’
‘I know Sue was joking about the Internet search, but it reminds me that some hidden Web addresses are numbers.’ Henry flexed his fingers and began typing on the keyboard.
‘No, Henry.’ Liz turned the PC off.
‘Why? Don’t you want to find out?’
‘Yes, but not here.’
‘Do you think it may cause trouble?’
‘More than just trouble, danger— Professor Smith only told us about it when he knew he was dying, so we should be extremely careful how we proceed with this message.’
‘Do you think someone will trace us here if we log on to a web site?’
‘That’s one thing the Professor taught us before he died: you can never be too cautious.’
‘In that case, we’d better go to a net café in the city.’
The phone rang; it was Liz’s mother. She told Liz that her father had recovered soon after being admitted to the hospital. The doctor said it could have been the shock or a slight concussion from the fall. Anyway, he would have to stay in hospital for now. She said the x-ray confirmed his right knee was fractured, but it was the concussion the doctor was worried about. She’d organised Sue’s mother to stay with them that night.
Liz felt great relief that her father was all right. Soon Sue’s mother arrived. She told them to go back to sleep. Feeling exhausted, Liz fell asleep in no time.
When she woke up it was ten o’clock. She rushed downstairs, where Sue’s mother was having a cup of coffee in the living area.
‘Good morning, Linda. Any news about Dad?’
‘Your mother rang not long ago. Your father is in a stable condition; however, he’ll have to stay in hospital for a week for observation. Your mother said you can visit him this afternoon.’
‘Thank you very much, Linda; we need to go to the city this morning, and we’ll go to the hospital this afternoon.’
‘In that case, I’ll go home for now and visit your father later. See you all there.’

As soon as Sue’s mother left, the three headed out, Sue complaining bitterly about the top she had borrowed from Liz. The net café was located between a Japanese sushi restaurant and a large, cheap backpacker’s accommodation, right in the city centre. Looking through the large glass window and watching crowds of office workers enjoying their lunch break, Liz said, ‘Here should be all right. It’s in public, and we can see who’s coming.’
Sue left them to it and went off in search of a clothing store. Liz paid for a PC, and Henry typed the series of numbers into the web address bar. Feeling her heart pounding, Liz glanced around; nobody was paying any attention to them. Henry punched the enter key. The screen slowly grew black, and then white words emerged. Unlike a professional web site, it was very basic. Henry clicked on an icon with Professor Smith’s nametag, and an article gradually appeared on the screen. 
Liz took a deep breath and started to read. In the article, Professor Smith stated that exhaustive research proved that Wave Rock was a magical prison of ancient evil monsters. 
‘I knew something was wrong with Wave Rock.’
‘Shush. Keep reading.’
After stating the dangerous consequences of destroying the rock, Professor Smith wrote that, according to his research, modern human firearms were useless against these ancient evil monsters; they could only be destroyed by witchcraft and ancient weapons such as swords, spears, clubs, wooden sticks, bow and arrows, and the like. Although he was trying to persuade authorities not to proceed with the mine project, he doubted anybody would listen to him, so he wanted the council to be prepared. 
‘What council?’
‘Shhh.’
The article was short. Liz assumed people in the council knew what he was talking about.
Henry closed the article, and a white window popped up. A line of words appeared: Is this Professor Smith from Western Australia?
Henry typed rapidly; Professor Smith was killed by a group of vampires last night.
‘What are you doing?’ Liz whispered as another line of words appeared on the screen. Identify yourself; how did you get Professor Smith’s login?
‘We are …’ Before Henry managed to type any more, Liz gripped his wrist. ‘What are you going to say? Remember Li’s letter!’ 
‘Whoops— forgot about that.’ 
‘I’d better do this,’ Liz said, but Henry insisted that he was able to type faster. ‘I’ll be more careful this time.’ He typed We’re unable to identify ourselves, but we are Professor Smith’s friends. He told us the web address before he passed away.
I believe you. Let me introduce myself. I am Professor Brown, the president of the council.
Dr Blanc mentioned you.
Did you see him recently?
I’m sorry. Dr Blanc and some of his colleagues were also killed by the backpack vampires last night.
Did you say ‘Backpack’ vampires killed Professor Blanc and the people with him?
Yes.
There was a long silence.
‘What’s happened?’ Liz asked.
‘I don’t know,’ Henry said. ‘Let’s wait a couple of minutes.’
 ‘I think we should go. I feel creepy here.’
‘Come on, Liz, we’re in public. No vampires would dare come out in bright sunlight,’ Henry said.
‘Be quiet. Professor Smith said that they are not vampires. We should leave now.’
‘Just another minute; this is our only hope to get help.’
‘OK, sixty seconds and we’re out of here.’ Liz was fidgety and nervous; she stared out the window and was relieved to see Sue running towards the café. Finally, words appeared on the screen again. Tell me about the monsters.
They broke out of a magic prison, and it’s just a matter of a few days before hundreds or thousands of people could be slaughtered. Can you help?
Professor Blanc and the group of people with him were sent there to slay the monsters. There was another long pause. Last night the council was also under attack by the ‘backpack’ vampires; only a few members escaped. I need to find a few more people and then we’ll try to come to Western Australia as soon as we can.
‘I remember reading in the newspaper about professors missing from a conference in London,’ Henry said quietly. How soon do you think you will be able to arrive in Perth?
We will have to smuggle ourselves in.
Do you have any idea who these backpack killers are?
Some guesses, but not sure; they seem to be from a highly civilised world.
Are you telling us they are aliens? 
Sue came gasping into the café and hurried over to her friends. ‘Liz…outside…’ She pointed with a shaking arm. Liz peered out the window.
‘Wow, look at this!’ Henry exclaimed. Liz swung back again.
Yes, we believe they have been visiting and studying us for quite a while. They possess some extremely advanced technology, almost like they have decoded all ancient spells and applied them to their weaponry systems... The screen went blank. Henry hit keys and swore under his breath.
‘Henry, we have to go. Now!’ Sue stuttered.
Henry didn’t answer, but hit the keyboard trying to reconnect. Liz grabbed him. 
‘We’re going. We shouldn’t have passed so much information over the net…’ She dragged Henry from his seat even as a new window popped up.
‘There,’ Sue said in a muted shriek. Liz’s stomach sank. A group of people, each carrying a backpack, strode towards them. She recognised the leader in front. They did not look like vampires any more.

Homeless Man 

‘Quick; out the back!’ Liz said. Ignoring the protests of the café owner, the three hurried out to the alley and ran along it to the side street. Liz’s face was pale; she tried to swallow the lump in her throat. They climbed the overhead footbridge and fled down it to the opposite side of the street. Looking back, she saw the backpackers walk into the café. After a few seconds they appeared at the steps of the footbridge.
‘We’d better move. They’re walking towards us.’ The three speed-walked through a few shops and paused at the other side of the city arcade. 
‘They’re still behind us,’ Sue whispered.
‘How do they know!’ demanded Liz. It seemed the backpackers didn’t know where they were exactly, but were following some kind of trace she and her friends left behind. ‘How can they tell where we are, if they can’t see us?’
Henry suddenly said. ‘Of course! They’re tracing our scent, left on the chair and keyboard. Follow me, quick.’
As the escalator carried them to the underground food hall, waves of food smells hit Liz’s nostrils; she dodged among the hundreds of tables and people, feeling her stomach rumbling and reminding her she hadn’t even had breakfast yet; but she had neither appetite nor time for anything at the moment.
Henry led the way past Subway, the Sushi bar, Mexican food, the Middle East stall, and the Chinese BBQ noodle bar, and up the escalator to the ground floor again. They skidded through another food hall, then another. Henry certainly knew where all the eating places were, Liz thought wryly. When they had passed through the third underground food hall, Henry said, ‘We should take a bus and get out of the city before they trace us again.’ He led them to one of the free city circle buses at a fast trot, and they leapt aboard as it moved off.
There was no sign of the backpackers behind them.

They sat under a large tree on the Kings Park hilltop, staring at the sky over Perth, the Swan River, and the Narrows Bridge. Liz used both hands to cover her face.
‘What’s the matter, Liz?’ Sue put her hand on Liz’s shoulder.
‘I’m sorry; I just feel so helpless…’
‘Liz, we can’t just sit here and cry; hundreds of thousands of people’s lives are depending on us; we need to do something.’ Henry sounded quite angry. Liz shrugged and said nothing.
‘Henry, can’t you see what’s happened? Dr Blanc and dozens of his colleagues are dead, Professor Smith and Li Ping have died, and the few remaining members of the council in Europe are being hunted by the backpack killers. Nobody is coming to help us. What can we do with only the three of us?’ Sue slumped in misery. ‘And I haven’t managed to buy myself a new top!’
Henry groaned and threw himself onto the ground as well.
Sue said, ‘Look at that strange old man standing beside the post box! Now he’s walking towards the bush. I’m sure I’ve seen him before…’ She paused for a few seconds, and Liz and Henry sat up. Strange men were very interesting to them right now. ‘Yes, I remember now; I saw him in the protest march yesterday. Something’s not quite right about him.’
Liz squinted at the old man, now vanishing among the trees. ‘Yes, he does look a bit unusual.’
‘Do you think he’s a vampire?’ Henry asked.
‘Or one of the backpack killers,’ Liz said. 
Sue’s face suddenly became pale. ‘What should we do?’
Henry stood up. ‘I’ll go and capture him so we can find something out about our enemy.’ 
‘Wait…’ But Henry shot away before Liz managed to finish her sentence. She turned to Sue. ‘I have to go and help him. Sue, you stay here and wait for us to come back.’ 
‘All right, I should be fine here in public.’ Liz disappeared into the bush. Sue leaned back against the tree, glad she wasn’t being asked to help. She was still feeling shaken by her cowardice the night before, and didn’t want to get into a fight again. She looked around and saw more strange men walking towards her. Hesitating for a second, she stood and walked after Liz and Henry.
Sue walked cautiously through dense bush. It was darker here and there was no sign of either Liz or Henry. 
‘Hey you - stop!’
Sue turned. 
It was the old man. How could both Liz and Henry have missed him? She turned around, walking quickly out of the bush.
In the blink of an eye, the old man stood in front of her again. ‘Did you hear me? I told you to stop.’
‘Why should I stop?’ Sue glanced around; hoping Liz or Henry would show.
‘This is why.’ The man took up the dirty rag off his head and his face.
Sue felt faint. The vampire’s long fangs shone in the dim light, exactly as Sue remembered from the last encounter. Li Ping had saved her and her friends then, but she would have to save herself this time. She forced herself to gaze into the vampire’s glowing, sunken eyes.
‘You didn’t scream, impressive. I guess you don’t know who I am. I haven’t sucked fresh blood for a very long time, and you are the lucky one today.’ He advanced towards her.
Uncontrollably, Sue let out a loud scream, but her body was frozen by fear. The vampire stood in front of her and his sharp claws reached out towards her neck.
‘Freeze! Put your hands behind your head.’
Turning, Sue saw two police officers about twenty metres away, their handguns aimed at the vampire. They must have been patrolling along the nearby footpath and heard her screaming. Sue felt relieved— surely the vampire would run away.
‘What did you say, freeze? Why do I want to freeze? It’s not that cold.’ The vampire stepped past Sue towards the police officers.
‘Stop where you are! One more step, and I’ll shoot.’
‘Shoot? Go ahead.’
A round of rapid gunfire echoed in the bush. Bullets hit the vampire’s chest, but bounced away like popcorn.
‘What the hell …’ 
The police officer did not have time to complete his sentence; the vampire leapt forward, his sharp claws slashing the officer’s throat. Red blood shot high in the air. The second officer only managed two steps before fangs sank into his neck.
Sue’s throat was dry, unable to make any sound; her legs were shaking, unable to move. She stood, helplessly, watching the vampire. He dumped the second police officer, turned, and walked towards her.
16
Kings Park 

As the vampire’s claw touched her skin, she managed to move her legs, stumbling backwards; tripping on something, she fell. The vampire leapt, diving like a hawk.
Being able to move again heartened Sue, even though she was flat on her back. She felt a warm current circulate around her. In an instant, she rolled backwards on her shoulders, recoiled her legs, and kicked at the vampire—and he sailed over her head like a string-snipped kite. Making a scissors cross-kick, she flipped up onto her feet.
‘Well, I have to confess I underestimated you!’ The vampire gave a whistle. As the high sound echoed in Sue’s ears, two dozen vampires appeared from nowhere. ‘I’ll correct my misjudgement. You’re shaking!’
Sue was. As she shook her wrist, her bangle slid off, slipping into her hand. In front of everyone’s eyes, the little loop grew into a ring three feet wide; the rim of the Yin Yang Ring sparked gold.
‘Look what we’ve got here, a magic toy.’ The vampire leader chuckled in a high-pitched tone. ‘I want her alive.’
With a series of loud clunks, the vampires drew broadswords, war axes, maces and other ancient weapons, advancing towards Sue slowly and cautiously. She took a deep breath and let the air out slowly. In a couple of seconds her knees stopped shaking; it gave her a bit more confidence. The vampires suddenly sprang. Sue was shocked by their speed as they formed a circle around her. 
Although she had her new weapon and had practised her combat skills in the Long Dream for years, Sue had no faith that she could defeat these monsters alone. Listening to their armour and weapons clunk, watching their long sharp fangs getting closer and closer, she decided to run.
However the vampires were closing in from all directions; she was surrounded. Only one gap appeared. To her left was a huge tree so wide the vampires had to walk around it, so there was a gap in their formation. Without hesitation, Sue lifted her Qi upwards, feeling her body become very light. Her feet pushed against ground hard, and like an arrow, she shot towards the tree.
Behind, like a group of wasps, the vampires zoomed after her. Sue felt the wind of the first broadsword almost touching her back; she didn’t look, but waving her ring backwards in a smooth curve, she bounced on to the approaching sword. 
Clunk!
Her arm was jolted violently; she almost lost her ring. Immediately, she knew she had lost her touch— Tai Chi does not use force against force. But there was no time to think. She landed a metre in front of the tree and sprinted towards the tree trunk, touching it briefly as her body leapt ten feet into the air. Her right foot pushed on the trunk again, and she shot downwards at the nearest vampire. 
She saw him heaving his war axe upwards, chopping at her with enormous force. She thrust her ring towards the axe, but before touching it, withdrew quickly, and then landed it on the huge weapon. 
This time there was no clink. 
It took only a split second to complete the sequence: pushing her Yin Yang Ring and utilising the support from the war axe, Sue launched herself once more high into the air. Twisting at her waist, she did a forward midair somersault, landing ten feet outside the vampire’s circle. As soon as her feet touched the ground, she lifted her Qi upwards again and started to run.
But she was not simply running away— she used a special method, the Tai Chi Eight Palace Gong Fu, running in complicated patterns so her movements were completely random; there was no chance for the enemy to predict where she might move next.
As she ran among the trees, Sue realised that she was in the area of their secret hideout; she saw the giant panda shape missing from the large tree trunk ahead. Suddenly she felt more confident, with an advantage over the vampires. Twisting at the waist, Sue made a smooth curve right in front of a tree. The vampire behind crashed into the hard wood.
The vampires hadn’t been able to get her yet, but Sue knew she couldn’t hang on like this forever. ‘Where are you, Liz and Henry?’ While running, dashing, and leaping among trees and vampires, Sue repeated these questions in her mind. Suddenly, she heard Liz’s voice. 
‘Sue! Where are you?’
She leapt in the air and glided through the narrow gap between a broadsword and a war axe, looking around to find where Liz’s voice came from. ‘Liz, is that you talking to me?’ Sue asked aloud, but there was no answer.
A few seconds later, she heard Liz’s voice again. ‘Sue, where are you?’
‘Liz, I wish that you could hear me. I’m battling over two dozen vampires right now,’ Sue thought in her head. To her great surprise, she heard Liz’s reply in her mind.
‘Sue, I can hear you in my head. Henry and I got lost. It must be a vampires’ trick. Tell me where you are.’
Sue understood. She told Liz where she was. But the conversation made her lose focus. Soon five broadswords covered all possible escape routes. 
As the deadly swords closed in on Sue, a dark blue whip dropped from above. Sue gripped the tip of the whip and swung her ring in a circular motion, bouncing the swords away. In a swish, she disappeared from the vampires’ circle.
Once she was securely hugging the tree branch fifteen feet above ground, Liz’s whip appeared again; like an angry dragon waggling in the air, it whistled, twisted, and bit. Vampires were thrown into the air or knocked to the ground. With her whip making a large circle, Liz withdrew and then stretched out her arm; like an arrow, the whip shot out, penetrating a vampire’s heart; its body exploded.
Then Henry appeared: wrapped inside spinning green sword shadows, he bounced a vampire’s mace away and slashed his arm off.
Emboldened by her friends’ attack, Sue jumped from her branch, ducked a war axe, and slashed at a vampire’s leg. Blood gushed out. 
It was the first time Sue’s had ever seen so much blood. She felt repulsed; she wanted to throw up. She staggered a few steps backward, looking away. She failed to see five daggers fly out of the injured vampire’s sleeve, shooting towards her.
Liz saw the daggers. 
She leapt in front of Sue. Still in mid-air, she simultaneously kicked at the two lower daggers, captured the two higher ones, and clenched the last one between her teeth. Before her feet touched the ground, she twisted her wrists gracefully and threw two of the daggers at the vampire leader. As if she had been practising for years, she caught and threw the daggers in one smooth, circular movement. 
The daggers sank into the leader’s stomach; with an ear-piercing screech, he fell backwards and sank into the ground. The remaining vampires screamed in panic and ran, disappearing into the bush.
Liz spat the black dagger out. ‘That was close,’ she said, and collapsed.
17
The old man lost his horse

Rushing to Liz, Sue knelt beside her, shaking her shoulder gently, but there was no response. Liz’s face was grey. Henry knelt on her other side. 
‘Do you think it’s the dagger?’ 
‘I don’t know.’ Henry picked up the dagger, examined it carefully and threw it away. He checked Liz’s lips but could not find any cut or bruise. He examined her entire body; near the ankle on her right leg, he found Liz’s trousers torn a bit. Pulling the cloth away, he sucked a mouthful of cold air. ‘It looks bad,’ he said slowly. 
Sue peered at the ankle in horror. It was scarily dark, almost black, and the darkness seemed to be creeping upward.
‘Please, do something— quick!’
Henry held his two fingers up together forming the sword fingers, and jabbed at a series of points along Liz’s legs, arms, and shoulders. 
‘Do you think she’ll be all right?’
‘I hope so, but I’m not sure.’
Sue held Liz’s hand, put it against her face and sobbed. ‘Please Liz, don’t die…please don’t die…it’s all my fault…’
‘Stop it, Sue, it’s not your fault. If it’s anybody’s fault, it should be mine because I tried to capture the vampire in the first place.’
‘But still, if I hadn’t been so scared of blood, Liz wouldn’t have had to save me…’
Henry suddenly shouted. ‘The emergency help page from Li’s diary!’ 
‘Yes, the help page.’ She stopped crying and fumbled inside Liz’s pocket, found the diary. ‘Oh, but…’ She stared at the first blank page. ‘How do we get help?’
‘Let me have a look.’ Henry snatched the diary from Sue; the page in her hand was ripped out.
‘Thanks a lot, Henry!’ Sue said angrily, but immediately shouted. ‘Something’s happening!’ 
Traces of black ink were emerging on the white paper, finally firming into Chinese characters. Henry snatched again, and read. ‘“The frontier old man lost his horse.” Is that all we have here? An old man lost his horse?’ He crumpled the page and flung it down.
Sue picked it up and smoothed it out, frowning at the words. ‘Isn’t that some kind of Chinese idiom or story?’
‘Might be; but how helpful will it be to save Liz?’
Sue tucked the page inside the diary and put it back in Liz’s pocket. ‘Do you think the vampires will come back? Maybe we should go somewhere else. I feel creepy here.’
‘We can’t move Liz until she wakes up; otherwise I’m scared she’ll die. I don’t think the vampires will come back soon. If they do, we’ll just have to fight them. Let’s not worry about them, and have some rest.’
Sue didn’t think she would be able to stop worrying, but she did her best.

An hour later, Liz opened her eyes. Touching her injured leg briefly, she sat up with Henry and Sue’s help, and leaned against a tree. Henry briefly explained what had happened, and what he had done to stop the poison. ‘Liz, while you were unconscious we used the first emergency help page.’ He told Liz what was on the page.
‘It’s a classic Chinese four-word idiom. I know there’s a story behind it, but I don’t know what it is.’ Liz thought for a while. ‘I wish Li Ping had told us about the story.’
‘Why don’t we go and ask your dad about it?’ Sue suggested.
‘Sue, we don’t have time to find out about a Chinese story; the monsters may come back, and we need to do something about Liz’s injury,’ Henry said.
‘But it’s important to understand Li’s message; it’s our only hope at the moment. Besides, nobody here can help Liz with her injury.’
‘Look, I agree with you, but my dad would have no idea what Li Ping’s message is. All he knows are ancient stories for five year olds.’
Sue could be stubborn if she wanted. ‘Your dad knows more about Chinese culture than anyone we know— and don’t forget, he is always talking about Taoism, and Li Ping talked about it too, so there could be some connection there.’
‘Oh!’ Liz exclaimed remorsefully. ‘I completely forgot about Dad being in hospital. Let’s go and ask him.’
‘But how can you explain your injury to Mum and Dad?’
‘Could you help me stand up?’ As soon as her injured foot touched the ground, Liz felt as if a sharp knife was stabbing into her ankle. She let out a painful groan.
‘Are you sure you’re able to walk?’ Sue stared at Liz’s pale face.
‘I’ll be fine.’ Liz used her sleeve to wipe the cold sweat beads from her forehead. “I’ll say I twisted my ankle.’
‘I don’t think that’ll fool Mum and Dad; we need to work out something else.’
‘We have no other option. Let’s go.’

A couple of times, Liz almost fainted on the way to the hospital; however, when walking into her father’s ward she tried to be as normal as she could.
Liz’s father half sat and half lay on the hospital bed, his right leg covered with hard plaster; however, he looked cheerful. ‘What’s wrong with your leg?’ he asked Liz immediately she stepped into the room.
‘Nothing serious, just twisted my ankle a bit. Dad, are you OK?’
‘My knee bone was fractured from the fall, but it’s not a big deal. It’s my head that’s bothering me the most.’
‘Have you taken some painkillers?’ Liz asked.
‘Normal painkillers didn’t work, and the doctor isn’t sure if it’s related to the fall. That’s why I have to stay here a bit longer.’
‘Dad, do you know the story behind the idiom of ‘The frontier old man lost his horse’?’ Trying to act as normal as possible, Liz sat on the chair beside her dad’s bed.
He looked at her for a second. ‘Why do you suddenly ask that?’ 
‘Oh, we were just talking about this Chinese idiom, and none of us know anything about it,’ Henry said.
‘Well, in that case, let me tell you the story.’ 
He looked pleased. Liz and Henry had rarely asked him anything about Chinese-related topics. When they were young, he had tried to make the old Chinese stories sound interesting, but he was rarely successful. In the last few years he had given up. 
Today, under the most unlikely circumstances, Liz had to pretend to enjoy his talk. She sighed inside, and forced herself to listen to what her father had to say. 
‘A long time ago there was an old man who lived near the frontier in the north of China. He had a horse, and relied on it to carry goods to the market and to work in the field; the whole family depended on it to make a living. One day, the horse was gone. Although the old man and his son searched everywhere, they couldn’t find it.
‘The old man’s neighbour tried to comfort him. “You should not feel too bad. This kind of disaster could have happened to anyone.” 
‘The old man said, “But we don’t know if it’s a good or a bad thing yet.”
‘The neighbour thought he was too depressed to think straight. “Of course it’s a very bad thing. How could it be a good thing if you lost all your assets?”
‘The old man said calmly, “Let’s wait and see.”
‘A few days later, the old man’s horse came back to him, along with a few wild horses. The neighbour came to see him. “You’re right about losing your horse; it’s ended up being a good thing. Congratulations.” 
‘The old man said, “How can you be so sure it is a good thing?” 
‘The neighbour was puzzled. “Of course it is a good thing; you’ve got a few extra horses.”
‘The old man said, ‘Let’s wait and see.”’
Liz and Henry exchanged a look, but said nothing. 
‘The old man’s son tried to ride one of the wild horses but he fell off and broke his leg. The neighbour visited the old man. “I’m sorry to hear what happened to your son. You’re right again. It’s not a good thing to get the wild horses.”
‘The old man said, “How can you be sure that it’s not a good thing?”
‘The neighbour was completely lost. “Of course it’s not a good thing. How can it be a good thing if your only son broke his leg?”
‘The old man said, “Let’s wait and see.”
‘A few days later, a war broke out between China and its northern neighbour. All the young men in the village went to the war but none of them returned. The old man’s son was unable to join the army because of his broken leg; he was the only young man in the village to survive. The neighbour asked the old man one last time, “Tell me when you can be certain it is a good or a bad thing.” 
‘The old man said, “There is no absolutely good or bad thing: it depends on how you look at it.”’ 
Their father paused. ‘By the way, do you know where this frontier was?’
‘I think…actually I have no idea,’ Liz said, stifling a yawn.
‘It was the Great Wall of China.’ Her father paused again. ‘Do you know, there’s another Chinese idiom related to horses: “The old horse knows its way home”.’
Liz felt it had been a complete waste of time to asking her dad about the idiom, and she had no interest in enduring another story, but before she could say anything, Sue said that she would like to hear it. Sue sometimes was too polite, almost painfully polite. 
While her father told the story, Liz battled with the agonising pain from her injured ankle, the frustration of being unable to tell anybody about the backpack killers and the monsters, and the hopelessness of getting help from anywhere. It felt like eternity but finally her father completed his tale. All Liz had heard was that it was about an old horse that knew its way home. 
She tried to smile and spoke as politely as possible. ‘Thank you so much for telling us the stories, Dad, they’re very interesting. I really enjoy them. Where’s Mum?’
‘She went to do some shopping and should be back soon.’
‘We have to go out again. We have an appointment with… um… Li Ping this evening, so can you please tell Mum that we’re not coming back for dinner?’ Liz was relieved her mother wasn’t here or, she wouldn’t get away so easily; her mother would ask questions about the appointment. 
Looking at her father, Liz found her eyes moisten; she didn’t know what would happen to her, didn’t even know if she would see her parents again or hear her father drone on about Chinese tales again. Trying her best to stop the oncoming tears, she kissed her father on the cheek. ‘I love you, Dad.’
‘What are we going to do now?’ Sue asked after they were outside.
‘I suggest we go to Li’s apartment, and see what we can find there.’
Each step Liz felt searing pain on her ankle. She suddenly remembered the story of which a mermaid was happily dancing with the prince while enduring extremely pain. She would be more than happy dancing with Fred, and with the extreme pain that she endured now. What a stupid thought, Liz laughed at herself; how could she think about such a thing at such a time?

Li’s apartment was on the third floor of a riverside apartment building. When they got there, it was quite dark. Henry found the spare key to the door. When they were inside, Liz suddenly felt dizzy and fell to the floor. 
When she opened her eyes again, she saw Sue’s red eyes and Henry’s concerned face. ‘How long was I passed out?’
‘About half an hour.’
Turning her head, Liz saw something on the carpet. She picked it up; it was Li Ping’s Chinese passport, and there was a plane ticket inside it for a flight that night to Beijing and return on Saturday morning. 
Liz’s eyes suddenly became bright. ‘I think I’ve decoded Li Ping’s message!’
‘Really? What is it?’ Henry and Sue asked at the same time.
‘Go to China,’ Liz said slowly, and her insides kicked and she lost her initial excitement. ‘Look for the old man living at the Great Wall of China.’
‘Of course!’ Sue hugged Liz. ‘You’re a genius…’
‘But the Great Wall is over five thousand kilometres long!’ exclaimed Henry. ‘How do you know where this old man lives?’
‘The answer is here.’ Liz shook Li Ping’s passport. ‘Li was going to go to Beijing, so the Great Wall in Beijing is where I need to go.’
‘You don’t sound very enthusiastic. What’s wrong?’ Sue asked. Liz didn’t answer immediately. ‘Are you worried about going to China alone?’ 
‘Yes, I am. I’m actually very scared; there is so much unknown in front of me. I don’t know if I can do it…’ Liz’s voice trailed off.
Sue held Liz’s hand, tried to say something, but said nothing in the end.
There was a long silence. 
And then Henry said, ‘Liz, I’m sorry that I can’t go to China for you, and I know it’s very daunting to go, but you have to do it, not only to save yourself, but also everyone living here.’
‘I know that. I’ll do it.’
‘You’ll need some money. How much money do we have?’ 
They searched their pockets and found ninety-six dollars. Most of it was Sue’s shopping money for her new top.
‘You’ll need more than that. Should I go back home to get more?’ Sue asked.
‘We have to leave now if Liz wants to catch the flight.’ Henry looked at his watch.
As Liz stood on the footpath alongside Henry and Sue, waiting for a taxi, she worried aloud. ‘I don’t know if this is the right thing to do. I can’t let Mum and Dad worry about me again. Last time we went to the mine protest only for one day …’
Henry interrupted impatiently. ‘Liz, you’re on a mission to save hundreds of thousands of people’s lives, as well as your own. One day Mum and Dad will understand.’
Sue offered something more practical. Raising her hand she stroked her face, and in a blink she changed into Liz, and then Li, and back to herself again. ‘With the help of this mask, I can be Liz, Li Ping and myself; surely we’ll be able to make up some convincing stories to tell your parents.’ 
‘Li said we have one week to get ready at the most, so you’ll need to come back on Saturday...’ Henry said, but Sue interrupted him. She held Liz’s hand, and said softly, ‘Liz, if you can’t find any help by Saturday, you should stay there a bit longer. There are lots to see in China.’
Liz hugged Sue, and then Henry. ‘I’ll visit China and spend a long time there, but not this time. I’ll come back this Saturday whether I find any help or not. Please take care.’
The taxi came and Liz got in. While waving at Henry and Sue, she felt tears flow down her cheeks. She hoped she would come back alive.

The Long Story 

Opening her eyes, Liz looked around, and slowly the reality that she was in an airplane sank in. Glancing at her watch, she realised she must have been asleep or passed out for hours. Fortunately nobody was next to her; her seat was positioned near the toilets at tail end of the plane.
Feeling dizzy and headachy, she pulled herself to a sitting position. The throbbing pain at her ankle was now like a red-hot iron touching her bone at regular intervals. 
Better to do something to take her mind off the pain. Liz took out Li’s diary. 
Among the pages and pages of detailed explanations of Tai Chi, there was no mention of any contacts in China. Liz sighed. She took out her pen and stared at it. What a pity that she hadn’t learned how to write with it. 
She stroked the brush across a blank page at the back of the diary, wishing that Li Ping had had time to teach her how to use it. If she could paint things and make them come alive the way Li had, she would be able to create an army of magic soldiers, and then she would no longer have to worry about the monsters or the backpack killers. She would be able to paint many lovely animals, too— for example, a handsome horse to ride. 
While immersed in her daydream, she saw ink traces slowly appearing on the blank page. She thought her eyes were tricking her, but a few seconds later she was spellbound— the page in front of her eyes was full of Chinese characters. 
Looking around to ensure nobody had been watching, Liz started to read.
‘Liz, you’ll be the only person ever to read this story.’ Liz felt tears flow down her cheeks. How she longed to see Li again and get her help. Wiping the tears with a damp sleeve, Liz read on. 

Once upon a time in China there were three magic warriors, the most powerful and brave fighters against evil at the time. However great the dangers and difficulties, galloping on their magic horses they went to the four corners of the vast land of China to slay evil monsters; with deep respect in their hearts, people called them the ‘Wind and Dust Jian Ke Trinity’ (Liz knew that Jian Ke means Sword Guest in Chinese). Because of the colours of their capes, they were also called the Red, White and Black Cape Jian Ke.
One day they were informed that evil creatures were gathering in a secret cave, so they went to slay them, but found it was a trap set not only by the evil creatures, but also by the ‘good magic people’ who were jealous of Jian Ke’s success.
During the battle, the White and Red Cape Jian Ke were injured. Thanks to the Black Cape Jian Ke’s magic pen, the three of them managed to get out of the situation.
It was the last activity of the Wind and Dust Jian Ke Trinity in China. Gradually, time eroded people’s memories. Most people, including scholars, came to believe that the Wind and Dust Jian Ke Trinity referred to Lijing, Hongfu and Curled Beard Guest in the Tang Dynasty.

Li’s story was a big surprise to Liz, as it contradicted what her father had told her about Jian Ke during the Tang dynasty, and all the historical books written by both Chinese and western scholars. But maybe she hadn’t been paying attention. Liz kept reading.

In fact, the three had escaped to a mountain known to nobody but themselves, far from the human world. Using all the Far Shu he knew, the Black Cape Jian Ke tried to save the Red and White Cape Jian Ke’s lives.
After three days of great effort, the Red and White Cape were out of danger but too weak to go anywhere, so every day they did their meditation together to cure their internal injuries, while the Black Cape went out to find food for them. The irony was that this was the first time they had time for themselves; they didn’t have to rush around fighting evil.
Finally the White Cape Jian Ke felt strong enough to join the Black Cape outside, and then the Red Cape told her that he loved her.

Liz hadn’t expected the White Cape Jian Ke to be a girl. 

She liked both of her friends. Deep in her heart, she knew that she loved the Black Cape Jian Ke, and she knew he loved her as well. Because they didn’t want to hurt the Red Cape’s feelings, they had never said anything to each other.
She didn’t know what to say. Those few seconds felt like eternity. Finally, she said she needed time to think about it, and rushed out of the cave without looking at the Red Cape Jian Ke.

It was the end of the page. Liz turned it over but there was no word on the next page. As she wondered what to do, the words vanished and new words appeared.

Outside the cave, she saw a glimpse of the Black Cape Jian Ke disappearing behind the huge triple-peak-rock, and she knew he had heard the Red Cape’s confession. She wanted to tell him her real feelings, but wasn’t sure if it was the right thing to do; anyway, she followed him to the deep forest.
Seeing him sitting on the ground in the lotus position, she thought that he was doing his normal meditation, but this couldn’t have been further from the truth. As white smoke came out of his head, she knew in an instant that he was going to burn all his supernatural power, eventually ending his own life.
In just a single leap she reached him, but it was too late. All that was left in front of her was a pile of clothes; the Black Cape Jian Ke had vanished. She sat on the ground, tears rolling down her cheeks.
She didn’t know how long she sat there, one hour or two days; finally she decided to go back to tell the Red Cape Jian Ke what happened, but he was nowhere to be seen. Searching everywhere around the mountain, even using all her supernatural powers, she failed to find him. He must have followed her and witnessed what had happened. Maybe he somehow felt responsible for the Black Jian Ke’s self-destruction. Their most powerful enemies had failed to destroy them, but their own love had defeated the Wind and Dust Jian Ke Trinity. 
After wandering around the mountain for another few days, the White Cape decided to follow her lover, burn her power, and eventually end her own life. Sitting in the lotus position, she used a self-destruction Far Shu to burn all her supernatural powers. A feeling of enormous energy built up inside her like a volcano. She knew that everything would explode and be over in a few seconds.
Just then, a thought struck her like lightning. She realised that she had to live on, but it was too late: white smoke started emerging from her head. Instinctively, she applied San Gong Far Shu, which can boost one’s power a hundredfold to enable one to make a last strike against an enemy. Of course, the San Gong Far Shu is so strong it kills both combatants. However, the White Cape Jian Ke had run out of choices, and she hoped the two Far Shu would work against each other. She needed a miracle.
She felt an explosion inside her body. She saw her skin blow up like a balloon and burst. When all of her old skin had exploded, she had new skin underneath. By accident, she had invented a Reborn Far Shu.
In the split of second before she was going to die, she suddenly remembered the magic calligraphy pen was indestructible. If she could find the magic pen, she would be able to use it to discover where the Black and Red Cape Jian Ke were. And this thought had saved her life.
She rushed to where the Black Cape’s clothes were, hunting through them, but failed to find the magic pen. If the Black Cape Jian Ke were dead, the pen would be there with his clothes; therefore, he must still be alive somewhere. She promised herself, at whatever cost, to search the whole world and find her true love.
Liz paused, looked around and then kept reading.

The White Cape Jian Ke wandered around China trying to find the magic pen and the Black Cape Jian Ke; year after year, century after century, she searched. With the help of her Reborn Far Shu, every sixty years she became young again, but each time she used the Far Shu, she wondered if she would survive. She had been lucky so far.
Fourteen years ago, an I Ching prediction told her that, in order to find the magic pen, she had to travel towards south over the oceans. She left China for the first time.
The prediction brought her to Perth, the capital city of Western Australia. She knew that one day the calligraphy pen would appear in this ancient, but also new, land. Day after day, year after year, she waited patiently, living in the strange country. She managed to master the language; meanwhile, she also started a Tai Chi class.
One Saturday night just before going back to China, she saw a rainbow light shoot into the night sky. She knew she should go to China and do what she should do, but she had to stay and find where the rainbow light came from. Nothing could stop her after so many centuries of hard searching.
Unfortunately she didn’t manage to locate the rainbow light, so she did another I Ching prediction. Tomorrow she would go to the lake inside the bush, and find out…

Liz couldn’t believe there was such a long story behind her birthday present. At the same time, she suddenly understood why Li’s expression was so sad when she took the calligraphy pen back into her hand at last; in her mind, Li had always imagined that she’d see her lover when she finally found the pen. 
Liz turned the page and found descriptions of the San Gong Far Shu. Liz was fascinated that it could boost one’s power a hundredfold. For the rest of the flight, she studied the Far Shu that Li had used to save her life.
The cabin lights went on and the stewards started busily distributing breakfast to the passengers. As she closed the diary, Liz saw the characters of Li’s story disappear. To her amazement, in their place appeared a painting. 
At that second a steward bent over her with a tray, and she didn’t have time to take a closer look at the picture.


Part two

19
Taxi Driver

In his new, neat uniform, the young Chinese customs officer stared at Liz’s face, for what seemed minutes, glanced back at the photo on the passport, and then stared at her again. 
Were there flaws in her mask? Liz kept her smile going a bit longer until her facial muscles felt sore. Finally, after some heavy stamping, her passport was returned. 
Locking herself inside a toilet cubicle, Liz studied her face in her makeup mirror: a very attractive woman’s face. Although Li’s age was stated as thirty-two on her passport, her face looked, at the most, in the middle twenties, so that might be the reason the officer stared at her for an unusually long time. Maybe he was attracted by Li’s beauty as well. 
It was the first time someone had stared at Liz, not the way people look at a fourteen-year-old schoolgirl, but at a mature and attractive woman. Despite knowing it wasn’t her face being stared at, it made her feel something different; but she was unable to describe it.
Looking at herself in the mirror a while longer, Liz stroked her face from chin to forehead; in a instant, a shy, Asian-looking girl in her late teens or earlier twenties stared back. It was a very striking face, with willow-leaf shaped eyebrows and black diamond pupils in clear eyes, a tiny cute nose, and fresh cherry lips; all framed by shiny black hair. Last time she had put on this face she hadn’t taken a close look; now, although she would never admit this to anybody, she thought that she could see many of her own features in it.
As she stepped outside the air-conditioned building, the heat blasted her like a giant hairdryer. Her right foot seemed less painful when it touched the ground; maybe her nerves had become numb after enduring such pain for so long. Despite being able to move her arms and legs, she felt little strength left in her body.
For a second, she felt that someone was watching her. She glanced around, unable to see anything suspicious, and picked up her belongings, telling herself not to be paranoid. She heard a clear ‘ding’. Glancing down, she saw her pen on the pavement. Quickly picking it up, Liz felt that now everyone was watching her.
Beyond a sea of cars in the vast car park and the long queue of people waiting for taxies, there was a huge tourist advertisement board with a picture of the Great Wall. Liz couldn’t remember many of the Chinese stories her father had told her and Henry (maybe she hadn’t taken them in at all), but she did remember the most famous one associated with the Great Wall of China. 
Two and half thousand years ago, a young bride walked a thousand miles, looking for her newly wedded husband, who had been taken away and forced to build the wall. When she finally arrived, she was told that her husband had died and his body was buried inside the wall. Kneeling in front of the Great Wall, she cried for three days and three nights. On the third night, lightning struck and collapsed a large section of the wall; among the rubble she found her husband’s body…
Suddenly Liz could not think clearly. She was afraid she would faint again; leaning against the building, she slid slowly to the ground, panting rapidly.
‘Miss, do you need a taxi to get into the city?’ someone asked in Mandarin.
Liz looked up. A man in his middle twenties. It was quite strange, in the middle of summer, to see he wore a thick black long-sleeved Gong Fu shirt and a pair of long black loose trousers. He looked sleek, very athletic and more like a Gong Fu movie star than a taxi driver. Liz remembered she hadn’t had much money with her. ‘No, thank you; I’ll take a bus to the city centre,’ she answered in Mandarin.
‘Miss, all buses have just left, and you’ll have to wait a couple of hours before they return to the airport.’
She couldn‘t waste hours waiting for a bus. Liz could feel her injury getting worse again, and she desperately needed help even though she had no idea where and how to find it. She nodded. ‘In that case, I may take a taxi then.’
‘You don’t look very well. Let me carry your luggage.’
Liz had no luggage except the small daypack by her side. She struggled up and followed him, walking into the sea of taxis in the car park. She sank thankfully into the back seat. The backs of the front seats had been covered with stickers advertising traditional Chinese medicine. Liz recognised the Chinese characters for tiger bone and bear palm. ‘I think I’ll take a different taxi.’ The taxi driver glanced at her, and then laughed. ‘It is the tiger bone spirit, isn’t it? Please take it easy, Miss. They are fake tiger bones.’ He paused for a second, and then said, ‘Please stay, Miss. I’ll take them off right now.’ He leaned back and tore off a few stickers with tiger and bear characters. ‘Believe me; I do feel shame about them.’
‘Me, too.’ Liz sat down again. 
‘Thank you very much, Miss. Believe it or not, I love wild animals, particularly tigers. Would you like some herb tea? It’s free of charge, very good for hot weather like this.’ He passed a bottle to Liz.
After recognising the character for ‘chrysanthemum’ among other herb names that she was unable to pronounce, Liz drank a mouthful of the green liquid. The bitter taste cleared her head instantly. ‘Thank you very much, I feel better.’
‘Where do you want to go in the city?’
‘Actually, I need to go to the Great Wall.’ 
‘From your accent I can tell that you are an overseas Chinese. Yes, everyone should visit the Great Wall while in Beijing. Which part of the wall would you like to go to?’
Of course there are many parts of the Great Wall if it is over five thousand kilometres long— why hadn’t she thought about that earlier? It felt hard to breathe, as if a large chunk of rock lay on her chest. She finally said, ‘I really don’t know much about the Great Wall. Which part do you recommend?’
‘Well, the closest and most popular part is Badaling, about one and half hours’ drive from the city; the next most visited is Mutianyu, around two hours away. They both are very good. Most advertisement pictures are taken from these places.’
Where would the old man be living? Maybe not so close to the tourist areas, ‘I’m not into the standard tourist attractions. I’d like to see the real Great Wall, the authentic parts that haven’t been repaired.’
The taxi driver nodded. ‘I know such a place, about three to four hours away. I can take you there, but it would cost you five hundred Yuan.’
Liz looked in her wallet. ‘Sorry, I haven’t got enough money.’
‘In that case, I can take you to the city centre, and you can take bus No.99 at the south-west corner of Tiananmen Square. It’s called Simatai Great Wall; it’s much cheaper by bus.’ He started the car.
‘Thanks.’ Liz laid her head on the headrest and closed her eyes. 
She felt like she was riding on a roller coaster; her head was spinning at high speed. She heard the taxi driver say something, but it took her a while to work it out. 
‘You walk through this market to Tiananmen Square, and the bus stop is at other side. It should only cost you around one hundred Yuan.’
Liz paid him and dragged herself out of the taxi. ‘Thanks for your help, and the herb tea.’
The street was packed with stalls selling food, clothing, and souvenirs. Liz had to battle thousands of Chinese and foreign tourists who were bargaining loudly with the stall owners. Further down, a large group watched a Chinese Gong Fu and acrobat show. Liz heard the crowd giving a round of loud applause after the performer broke a pile of bricks with his bare hand.
After a few minutes walking, the street became quiet. Seeing the famous Tiananmen Square only a short distance away, Liz took a deep breath and prayed everything would be all right. Then she heard a girl’s voice. She was reciting a poem that Liz knew only too well.
‘“Gone the immortal, on yellow crane riding; since then, empty is the Yellow Crane Building …” Grandpa, I can’t remember the rest of the poem.’
Liz stopped, following the voice; she saw a girl in her middle teens sitting beside an old man. It was not entirely accurate to call him old: his white hair and long white beard put him in his late eighties, but his face looked only fifty. The pair sat on low bamboo stools behind a little bamboo table, and the large Tai Chi sign on the tablecloth caught Liz’s eyes.
‘This will be the last time I’ll tell you. Next time you’ll have to find it in the book yourself.’ He cleared his throat. ‘After departing, the yellow crane will never return; only the white clouds, a thousand years floating, accompany me.’
Liz looked at the Chinese characters on the table cloth: ‘If my words are not true, you need not pay a cent; if my words are true, a thousand pieces of gold are not enough: the magical fortune-teller.’ She was amused; it was quite an unusual way of advertising one’s business, and no surprise that there were no customers lined up.
‘Excuse me, fortune-teller, can you tell me my fortune?’ How ridiculous, Liz thought, as she heard the words come out of her own mouth. As if he could tell her what to do in China. She supposed that when one was desperate, anything was better than nothing.
‘Have you got enough money to pay me?’ the old man said in a deep voice.
‘Your sign says I don’t need to pay you a cent if you’re unable to tell the truth, and I don’t know if you’re able to tell the truth yet.’
‘All right, let’s wait and see: may I please touch your hand?’
Only then did Liz realised he was blind. Staring at his unfocused pupils, Liz reluctantly put her left hand on the table. The fortune-teller briefly fumbled over her palm and her fingers. He finished in a few seconds, but Liz had felt his hands: flexible and soft, not like an old man’s.
‘May I please also touch your face as well?’
Liz hesitated a few seconds but moved her head forwards. She felt his fingers stop momentarily at various Qi points, on her temple, under her eyes and under her nose.
‘So?’ Liz waited for him to tell her fortune.
He didn’t answer immediately; closing his eyes for a few moments, he spoke slowly. ‘You are not from China, but a very long way across oceans from another side of the world, right?’
‘You could tell that from my accent; anyway, go on.’
‘You are not well. The Yin Yang in your body is out of order, in a very bad state.’
‘Are you a doctor?’ Liz was surprised he could tell she was sick just from touching her hand and face.
‘Grandpa practised Chinese traditional medicine for many years, but nobody comes to see him anymore,’ the girl answered.
‘Can you please not interrupt us.’ He turned his head to the girl, and then faced Liz again. ‘You come to China not as a normal tourist but to seek help with your illness.’
Liz guessed that he could sense she breathed uneasily, and her face was hot, and so concluded she was sick. Many foreigners came to China to seek alternative medicine, so it would not be too hard to work that out. She suddenly felt dizzy again. She could not afford to waste time sitting here with a fortune-teller. She had to go to the Great Wall. 
Liz tried to keep her voice calm. ‘I’m not really sick, just catching a bit of a cold, and I’ll get over it in no time. I have to go. Because you haven’t managed to tell the truth, I assume I don’t need to pay you.’
‘Absolutely no need to pay, and I hope you recover from your cold soon. Enjoy your visit.’
Liz had seen photos of Tiananmen Square, but had not realised how spacious it was. The giant buildings in the background looked small against the vast space. Glancing at the Forbidden City across the huge square, Liz hoped one day she could visit it; but she had to go to the Great Wall now. 
Crowds of tourists wandered across the vast square, including groups of foreign backpackers. Liz checked her wallet and decided that she had enough money to take the bus to Simatai Great Wall. She bumped someone. ‘Sorry,’ she said, but soon realised she had made a big mistake. 
Two backpackers gripped her arms, one on each side. One of them said quietly, ‘Don’t make any trouble.’
A chill poured from her head to her toes. She knew instantly that they were the backpack killers. How had they followed her from Perth to Beijing? Had they been watching the airport as they did in Europe, as Professor Brown had said? 
Held by the two backpackers, walking towards a van ahead, Liz tried to move her arms but still felt little strength in her body. Nearby, more backpackers were closing in on them. 
She had to do something before they forced her into the van. 
Wriggling and struggling, she tried to drag her body to the ground. Her escorts tried to lift her up, and she moved her body upwards. They automatically tried to push her down again, and she dropped herself downwards fast; the men lost their balance, falling to the ground. Liz took off, running towards the street at the edge of the Square packed with thousands of shoppers and tourists, fifty metres away.
Within seconds, the other backpackers were following her in a fan formation, closing in fast.
Liz felt the dizziness again. No, I can’t faint now, she told herself. As a hand grabbed her arm, she twisted; the attacker lost his balance, but in those precious seconds the rest of the attackers caught up with her. 
She was surrounded.

Long Distance Bus

Dashing at the attacker in front of her, she gripped his upcoming hand, twisted, and saw him go down. Her knees suddenly gave way, and she was falling face down. 
Rotating in middle air, she landed on her back; as soon as she touched the ground, she rolled, fast; two attackers landed on the spot where she had been a split second ago.
Someone spoke Mandarin loudly, in a strong foreign accent. ‘Please don’t interfere. We are making a movie using hidden cameras.’ Liz recognised the voice of the leader of the backpack killers.
She rolled over, just in time to trip another attacker; she flipped up, staggered, narrowly missed being grabbed by an attacker, and bumped another attacker off balance; she fell backwards, landing on the back of the first attacker who was trying to climb up, sending him nose-down to the ground again.
Liz suddenly realised that she was performing the eight immortal drunken fists; the way she was staggering and bumping her enemy off balance imitated a drunk person’s behaviour, and the method of falling down and sitting on the back of her enemy, called ‘riding donkey backwards’, used her own weight to attack her enemy. Even though she could not recall learning the drunken fists at all, her body seemed to know what to do: her timing was so perfect that her attackers were always a moment too late to grip her. 
A large crowd had gathered, drawn by the fighting. Bystanders were commenting excitedly. Each time Liz outsmarted her enemy, they applauded and whistled. 
Liz wondered if the spectators thought of this as life and death combat, or a well co-ordinated, graceful, fluid dancing session. Perhaps the backpackers’ heavy breathing, rude shouting, and bleeding noses would tell them this was in earnest.
A thin layer of fog started blurring her vision. Her movements slowed. She knew she was going to faint. 
Then there was a loud bang, and thick smoke blanketed her head. Blinded, she heard footsteps around her, and then someone gripped her arm. With no strength left to struggle, her eyes closed against the stinging smoke, Liz felt herself hoisted over someone’s shoulder and carried away. 
A few minutes later she was put on her feet again. Opening her eyes, she found she was among millions of people on a busy street; the taxi driver from the airport stood beside her. ‘Who are you? Why do you help me?’
‘No time to talk; eat this, Chinese herbal medicine— it will give you energy.’ It was a black ball the size of a marble. Liz stared at it. ‘Please trust me; take it so you will be able to run. They will be here soon.’
Liz closed her eyes and put the black ball into her mouth. It was the bitterest thing she had ever tasted in her whole life; she almost threw up, but forced herself to chew and swallow. The man passed her a bottle of water and she drank. Immediately, she felt a hot current start from her stomach circulate through her torso violently, and spread to her legs and arms. She felt her strength returning. ‘Thanks, I can go now.’
‘Yes, you go. I’ll stay and distract them. Go ahead about a hundred metres, then turn left at the teashop; then go through the Hu Tong; at other side of Hu Tong there is a bus stop. Take bus number 72. The bus will stop at a roadside restaurant for a break.’ He handed Liz an ancient coin with a square hole in the middle. ‘Ask for the special chrysanthemum tea and pay for it with this coin and you’ll be looked after from there onwards. Can you remember all that?’
Liz put the coin in her jeans pocket and nodded. ‘Now, go.’ He disappeared in the opposite direction.
Taking a deep breath, Liz walked rapidly towards the teashop, negotiating her way among food stalls, silk shops, teahouses, restaurants, and thousands of people. She finally squeezed herself out of the crowd, popping into the Hu Tong. 
The Hu Tong were a maze of narrow alleyways connecting the courtyards of residential squares. Running past countless large wooden gates where older men and women sat waving their fans, dodging tricycles with mountainous loads, skirting Majiang tables with clicking tiles and clusters surrounding Chinese chess boards, Liz felt trapped in a labyrinth. She lost count of how long she had been running; eventually, she was out, and to her delight she spotted the bus stop right way. A number 72 bus was about to leave; she leapt aboard as it moved off.

She found a seat in the last row, squashed between two women. On her left, a peasant wearing a straw sunhat held three hens whose legs were tied together; on her right, a young woman held a baby that she breast-fed whenever he cried. The bus was unbearably hot, like a rice steamer. Liz felt sick again. Each time the bus drove over a pothole, the shock translated into a spasm of agony in her injured leg. She bit her lips to prevent herself groaning, but soon realised it was an unnecessary worry; what with the hens’ clucking and wing-flapping and the baby’s screaming, nobody would notice any sound from her.
As the level of the pain increased, Liz could almost feel the poison from her leg slowly spread into the rest of her body; her right leg must be completely black by now. She didn’t dare to look. 
After what felt like an eternity, she looked at her watch. She had only been on the bus for five minutes. How long before the break? No, she couldn’t sit there and count seconds for the rest of the journey; she needed to think about something else. 
Last time, her mother had been terribly worried about Henry and her while they were at the mine site. Liz couldn’t even imagine what her mother would feel if she knew that she was ten thousand kilometres away from home, injured and alone. Even though she knew that she had no choice but to do what she was doing, Liz still longed to hug her mother, and say sorry to her, but this thought was no happier than counting seconds. Liz switched her mind to another topic.
Ever since she could remember, her father had always talked about taking her and Henry to visit China, but somehow they had never managed to do it. She didn’t know if her father would feel angry or proud when he knew that she had gone to Beijing by herself. 
What would Sue and Henry be doing right now? She hoped Henry hadn’t encountered more vampires or backpack killers. Although she thought he needed to be more patient, she did admire his courage and his fearless spirit. 
The idea of blaming Sue for her injury never crossed her mind once. Liz felt deeply sorry for Sue; the poor girl had had to combat evil monsters and face their cruel reality, and blood— quantities of it. Liz tried hard to connect to Sue and Henry, the way they had done in Kings Park yesterday, but it didn’t work. 
What would happen to Fred if she couldn’t find help in time? He was brave and intelligent, fighting against the conservative government and powerful international companies, but he would be helpless against the monsters. He would need her to protect him. She had to find help, and she had to get back home in time, because she needed to save her loved ones, and all the other innocent…
Layers of fog slowly gathered over her vision, and the sickening dizziness returned. The pain increased. Liz had never imagined such pain existed. She felt her body was split in half. 
She was going to die, Liz told herself. The idea seemed quite appealing. If she gave up, closed her eyes, and let herself fall into the warm darkness, there would be no more pain, no more worries… 
Another shock woke her up as their bus drove into another pothole. She shook her head and forced herself back to reality. She could not give up; death was easy, and life was much more difficult. She had to live on so she could save her loved ones. 
Focus—she had to focus. 
Liz focused on the faces of her beloved ones, like a slide show, one by one— Mum, Dad, Sue, Henry, Fred …

‘The bus will stop here for twenty minutes. Please be back in time. We’ll depart in exactly twenty minutes,’ the ticket woman yelled above the noise. 
Looking through the cracked, mud-spotted windows, Liz could make out the blurry shape of a newly built ancient-style restaurant. She had a feeling of great relief. She had made it. Putting her hand inside her jeans pocket and touching the ancient coin, she followed everyone out of the bus and staggered towards the red restaurant door.

Tea Pouring Master

Although everyone gladly climbed out of the overworked and overcrowded bus, only the bus driver, the ticket woman, a citified-looking couple and Liz went to the restaurant. The rest stretched their legs nearby or sat under trees.
Dozens of huge round dining tables, each seating up to twelve people, were arranged neatly inside the restaurant’s large hall. A cluster of customers sat in one corner, drinking tea and playing Majiang. 
Liz chose a seat beside the window where she could see the front yard. Even though it wasn’t air-conditioned, ceiling fans made the restaurant quite pleasant compared with the scorching sun outside or the stifling air in the bus. Liz felt better.
‘Miss, would you like a cup of tea?’ a young waitress asked. 
Liz quite liked the waitress’ traditional white silk blouse and the series of jade bangles on both of her wrists. ‘May I have your special chrysanthemum herb tea please? Can I pay with this?’ Liz put the coin on the table.
The waitress’ eyes widened; she stared at Liz for a few seconds and picked up the coin. ‘Of course, Miss. Tea is coming.’ 
She went to the counter, coming back with a parcel on a tray. The wrapping was yellowish homemade paper, short pieces of straw still apparent on its surface. Turning over a little bowl that stood inverted on the tray, she poured the contents of the parcel into it. 
‘Since you are no stranger to us now,’ she said as she laid chopsticks in front of Liz, ‘do you mind if I ask who gave the coin to you?’ 
Although she spoke casually, Liz sensed a bit of jealousy in her tone. ‘A taxi driver, I don’t know his name— he saved my life, and told me to come to this restaurant.’
‘He is no taxi driver,’ the waitress spoke with pride. ‘What’s your name, if you don’t mind my asking?’
Chinese names had long been Liz’s favourite topic to discuss and debate with her father and Henry; her father told her that Liz can be used for both English and Chinese names, and it would be useful when she went to China one day. Today was the day, Liz thought.
‘Li Si, it means beautiful silk. What’s yours?’
‘Lin Huating, it means pictorial pavilion in the forest.’
‘Very poetic, I like your name.’
‘Oh, thanks, I like your name, too. Here is your tea pouring master.’
A waiter in a silky black Gong Fu outfit walked over holding an unusual teapot, a shiny copper pot with a spout at least a metre long. Standing about five metres away from Liz’s table, with one hand holding the handle of the teapot, his other hand made a few Gong Fu gestures; then he moved the teapot behind his back and bowed, and the long spout ejected a stream of water over his head, shooting at Liz. 
In her normal condition, Liz would have been able to move away easily to avoid the hot water stream, but at the moment she was unable to move even her little finger. She stared as the jet of steaming water curved in the air and landed in the little bowl centimetres away from her. Her jaw dropped; there was not a single drop spilled anywhere.
‘Drink it while it’s hot; it is good for you,’ the waitress smiled at Liz. She sounded a bit friendlier now.
Despite the burning hot water, after one tiny sip Liz felt a cold fresh current down her throat straight to her abdomen. The thin fog slowly dissolved from her vision; she could see clearly again—including a group of newcomers walking in.
Still carrying their large backpacks, in their jeans and thick long-sleeved shirts, the backpack killers walked in the front door, straight towards Liz. 
She had nowhere to run this time.
‘Masters, please have a seat at this table.’ The waiter with the long-spout teapot stopped the group of backpackers. 
The leader of the backpackers snorted, but sat at a round table about five metres from Liz; the rest seated themselves around the room, forming a half circle around Liz’s corner.
‘Masters, what would you like to have? Tea? Or dishes?’ the waiter asked in Mandarin.
‘Cha!’ the leader spoke in Mandarin with a strong foreign accent.
‘Service tea.’ The teapot waiter raised his voice. He made a few steps back, and stood beside Liz’s table. Lin Huating walked over swiftly, holding a large tray piled with little bowls. She put her tray on Liz’s table and picked up a bowl, twisting her wrist; it spun through the air towards the leader. 
Without blinking, the leader kept his gaze on the fast approaching bowl, and at the last moment flashed his hand up to grip it in midair. He missed; it suddenly spun down and dropped right in front of him.
‘So embarrassed for my poor trick, please forgive me,’ said the waitress, and then with both hands, she set spinning bowls in front of every backpacker. When she was finished, the teapot waiter took a step forward. ‘It’s time to show my poor trick.’
Watching the waiter’s graceful pouring, Liz felt amazed at how skilfully he was able to pour water in each individual cup from many different postures—bending over, standing on one leg, single handed— without a single drop spilled; but what was even more amazing was that he was actually performing Tai Chi, similar to what she had learned from Li Ping. 
Liz was also surprised to see steaming green liquid instead of normal water spurting from the teapot. There must be two separate compartments inside the teapot, she assumed.
The group of backpackers seemed to enjoy the performance as well. Liz thought there was an obvious reason— their target had nowhere to escape.
Noises came through the window; glancing outside, Liz gasped. From the south, two tractors drove in accompanied by loud engine thumping; from the north, a mini bus stopped with a screech of tyres; dozens of donkey carts emerged from both sides of the restaurant, all full of passengers. 
These were no ordinary passengers: they were armed with various weapons, short clubs with metal sparks, curved and straight great swords, bow and arrows, daggers, long spears. They gathered in front of the restaurant and chanted, ‘Kill foreign devils! Kill foreign devils! Kill foreign devils!’
It seemed the sudden noise distracted the teapot waiter’s focus; the hot green liquid stream, aiming at the cup in front of the backpacker leader, shot directly at his face.
Liz was impressed by how fast the backpacker leader’s reaction was. In the split second before the hot green jet arrived, he picked up the empty bowl in front of him. The scalding tea hit the bowl and splashed out over the two backpackers sitting beside him; they screamed. 
With an angry roar, the leader picked up a teacup full of the hot green liquid, throwing it at the waiter; but before it was launched, a bamboo stick hit the cup and it exploded. He shook his hand furiously, his face distorted with pain. 
Then, from the open window near Liz, a rain of bamboo sticks shattered the teacups in front of each backpacker. They all gasped with the pain of the burns on their hands and faces. 
The leader stood up and took out a torch-like object, and the other backpackers imitated him. Recent memories returned to Liz – images of Professor Blanc and his comrades being shot down by these objects flashed in front of Liz’s eyes. She wanted to scream, to warn people how dangerous those backpackers were, then she heard a very calm voice. 
‘If I were you, I would just leave. The liquid in the teacup isn’t nice green tea, but herbal poison. You need to seek help before it’s too late.’ Following the voice, Liz saw the taxi driver in the doorway. He turned and said to the armed people blocking the door, ‘Let them leave.’
The armed crowd parted, forming a corridor of swords, spears and clubs. 
The leader looked at the armed people, and then the taxi driver. ‘We’ll meet again.’
‘Not too soon, I hope.’
The leader and his followers walked out.
‘Thank you all for coming to help, my brothers and sisters.’ The taxi driver bowed to the large group. 
‘No problem, brother Shi.’
‘It’s pity we didn’t beat them.’
‘We should let them know who is in charge here.’
The taxi driver put his arms up to quiet the crowd. ‘They’ll come back soon. Could you please all pay full attention—anything suspicious, inform me immediately. Go back to your posts now.’ 
The group of armed people returned to their tractors, bus, and donkey carts, and disappeared quickly.
The teapot waiter said, ‘Brother Shi, why did you let them leave so easily?’
‘Cornered beasts can be very dangerous— and they are far more dangerous than cornered beasts,’ the taxi driver turned to Liz. ‘Let me introduce you to each other.’ He pointed at the waitress. ‘This is Sister Lin, nicknamed spinning fairy.’
‘I’m not his sister, I’m his fiancée.’
‘Nice to meet you, Sister Lin.’ Liz shook her hand.
‘This is brother Wu, nicknamed magic spoutless pot.’
‘How could you be called spoutless?’
‘Well, my name is Wu Hu, meaning five lakes, but friends jokingly called me pot less for the same pronunciation; later they called me spoutless instead because I do have a pot.’
‘But your teapot has a very long spout!’
‘Where is the long spout? I can’t see it.’ Wu Hu shook his teapot and the long spout disappeared.
‘What’s your nickname, brother Shi?’ Liz asked.
‘My name is Shi Sheng, it means rock sound.’
‘His nickname is magic bowless arrows.’ Lin Huating took a step forward, coming between Liz and Shi.
‘I see…’ Liz suddenly felt a sharp pain inside her head. She half-raised a hand, collapsing to ground. Through a haze of pain, she heard Shi Sheng say, ‘I need to take her to our grand master right now.’ 
‘How were you so sure she was the one?’ Lin Huating said.
‘The only thing in the world impossible to fake is one’s Gong Fu; her Tai Chi fists are beyond the reach of anyone we know, if not better than our grand master. And I also saw the pen she dropped at the airport— that’s how I found her; besides, our grand master has seen her already.’ 
‘I’ll go with you,’ Lin Huating said.
‘Me too,’ said the magic spoutless pot waiter.
Liz fell into complete darkness.

When she opened her eyes, Liz was half-riding, half-lying across an old shabby horse’s back, her arms dangling on each side of the horse’s neck. Wu Hu walked ahead holding his spoutless pot, and Shi Sheng and Lin Huating walked on either side of her.
‘She’s waking up.’ Lin Huating turned to Liz. ‘How do you feel?’
‘Not very good, I’m afraid,’ Liz tried to sit up and sound normal. ‘But I’ve been much worse.’
‘See the rock piles ahead— after that there are only a few miles to go,’ Shi Sheng said.
Liz looked ahead. Along the fog-covered valley, huge piles of rocks rose from the ground. She nodded. Then there was a long silence apart from the clear sounds of the horse’s hooves hitting the rocky mountain path. As they were almost at the rock piles, Wu Hu said suddenly, ‘Li Si, you know my spoutless pot is a magic pot. Would you like me to show you a few more tricks?’ 
‘Yes, please,’ Liz spoke with great effort, but tried to be as cheerful as possible.
Wu Hu put the spoutless pot on the tip of his index finger and spun it like a basketball player doing ball-tricks. When the spin stopped, the pot had grown five feet in diameter, a giant fat flat teapot. Everyone laughed.
Shi Sheng said, ‘I’ve never seen an uglier teapot in my life. You never showed this trick to me before. Can I please have a look at it?’
As Wu Hu passed his pot to Shi Sheng there was a loud bang, and a red spark exploded against the teapot’s side. Shi Sheng and Wu Hu were thrown into the bushes beside the path.
‘Take Li Si into the Rock Formation!’ shouted Shi Sheng. ‘It’s the foreign devils. Wu Hu and I will cover you.’ 
Lin Huating hit the horse hard on its flank. As the horse surged forward, Liz caught a glimpse of bamboo sticks and jets of green liquid flying from the bush. Her horse galloped among the towering rocks, and she wound her fingers in his mane and clamped her legs to try and stay on. The last thing she saw was Lin Huating spinning off her jade bangles, before a red spark exploded nearby and heavy fog blocked her vision. Even over the clatter of hooves and her gasps, Liz could hear Lin Huating shouting.

Inside the rock piles, the fog was thick. Liz was only able to see a few feet ahead. Her horse was still charging ahead violently and uncontrollably. Rock piles loomed and shrank as the horse carried her past, missing her leg by centimetres. Liz closed her eyes tight and prayed that they were not going to crash into the rocks.
She had no idea how long the horse galloped before it finally slowed a bit, and a bit more, and finally stopped. Its body dripped with sweat, as if it had walked out of a storm. Liz rolled off the saddle, holding the reins, and studied her surroundings. She knew she was in a deep valley between two huge mountains; she had seen that much before the attack. The rock piles were man-made, but their moss-covered surfaces showed their age, and they were enormous. Looking up, she could see them extending down the valley until they were lost in the fog. 
Leading the tired horse, Liz picked a likely-looking path. She limped along, gritting her teeth against the pain of her leg, realising that she was completely lost. Under the thick fog there was no way she could tell which way was out. She slumped to the ground in exhaustion and despair. She couldn’t believe that after so much hardship and so many deaths, and coming so close to finding the help she desperately needed, she was going to die among these rock piles.
She didn’t even have the energy to cry. She felt the last few drops of life draining out of her. She spoke to the old horse softly, ‘Old horse, I don’t know your name. I’d like to thank you for helping me escape from my enemy, but you can’t save my life. You don’t need to die with me here. Please go, and I hope you find your way home. Goodbye, old horse.’ She dropped the reins.
The horse seemed to understand her words. He sniffed at her shoulder and then slowly walked away. She watched him fade into the mist. ‘Old horse, I hope you can find your way home, old horse.’ 
Way home! Like lightning striking over the dark sea in her mind, Liz remembered something her father had said not very long ago— as a matter of fact, only yesterday. After he had told her the story about the old man who lost his horse, he had started another story, also related to a horse. Liz hadn’t paid attention, thinking it was just another boring old Chinese peasant’s tale, but she did remember it was about an old horse finding its way home.
What was the story? Liz wished that she had paid more attention to her father. Now the lives of herself and thousands of others depended on her memory of an old folk story. What was it? She ran her hands through her hair. Please, remember a bit more.
And then, suddenly, she got it. 
A surge of energy rushed into her limbs. She jumped up, chasing after the almost invisible horse.
She didn’t know how long she walked; the only thing she knew was that it was uphill all the way. When her eyes caught sight of a straw roof cottage, she knew she had come through. But she had used the last drop of her strength. 
Liz blacked out.

Needles

Strong scents made her sneeze. Liz felt wonderful. It took a while for her to work out why she felt so good— the pain was gone. Opening her eyes, the first thing she saw was the gauzy web of a mosquito net; then the corner of her eye caught a long, thin, silvery needle. 
She turned her head and more needles shone into sight; long, delicate, gold and silver needles stood along her arms, hands, and face; down her injured foot and knee. Liz knew they were acupuncture needles.
‘It’s great you’ve woken up. My grandfather said you might not wake until lunchtime, but I said you’d be up before breakfast, so I won the bet. My name is Fang— that means fragrant. What’s yours?’
Fang’s voice sounded clear and crisp, like a silver bell. Liz loved the sound of it. When she turned, her eyes opened wide: Fang was the girl who had been reciting the crane poem beside the fortune-teller.
Fang waved her hand to dismiss Liz’s amazement. ‘I know we’ve met before but you’ll have to wait till later to get the whole story. What’s your name?’
‘Li Si— beautiful silk.’
‘It’s lucky that my grandfather found you just in time; otherwise you’d have died.’
‘What happened to the others?’ Lin Huating’s scream still echoed in Liz’s ears.
‘Don’t panic, all of them are all right— at least almost all right.’ Fang told Liz that, despite the backpack killers’ powerful weapons, Shi Sheng, Lin Huating and Wu Hu had managed to escape through the rocks. 
‘Wu Hu lost his right arm but he is all right, and he wanted me to tell you that he should now be called armless and spoutless magic pot.’
Liz was horrified but smirked at his relayed message. ‘I’m so happy he’s alive. What about Sister Lin?’
‘A rock fragment hit her and broke her shoulder bone; otherwise, she is fine. Brother Shi got a few scratches but nothing serious.’ Fang paused. ‘We are all very interested to know what happened to you inside the rocks.’
Liz closed her eyes to get her thoughts together, and told Fang what happened: how she hadn’t remembered the details of the Chinese tale, whether they had ever slipped into her head at all, but how instead she figured out the essence of the story—that the old horse had the ability to find its own way home. She knew that animals don’t use their eyes like humans but depend on their instincts to navigate, and that the horse would follow its own course without the reins behind held by a human.
‘Wow, that’s incredible. Your father must be very knowledgeable about Chinese culture.’
‘Not really; but he knows an awful lot of folk stories.’
Fang sighed. ‘The fact is nowadays there are not many people who know much, or who are interested in knowing these stories. Anyway, something puzzles me— how could you know nothing about the Rock Formation, considering how good your Tai Chi is?’
Liz didn’t know how to answer that question. She could not tell Fang how she learnt her Tai Chi or she would lose her power. And she had no idea why the piles of rocks were connected with Tai Chi anyway. Then a voice flew in from outside the bamboo-matted curtain.
‘Fang, is that you talking?’ A white-haired, white-bearded old man, the fortune-teller, walked in. His movements were graceful and smooth, as if he was performing Tai Chi, and he was not blind at all. Liz felt relieved, because she didn’t need to answer Fang’s question, at least for now.
‘I really appreciate you saving my life. Could you please explain what happened…’
The grandfather put his hand up. ‘I know it’s a bit confusing at the moment but I promise I’ll explain everything later. I think we had better deal with your injuries first. Let me feel your pulse.’ 
He placed his index and middle finger on Liz’s wrist and closed his eyes. Liz knew that pulse feeling was the traditional Chinese way of diagnosing sickness. After few minutes he opened his eyes and smiled at her. ‘Your condition seems quite stable. I will remove the needles so you can get up and have a bit of fresh air.’ He took all the needles out. Fang helped her get up, and they all went outside. 

The fresh morning air, before the summer sun reached its full strength, felt cool and comfortable. The cottage was located on a flat piece of ground about halfway up the mountain, surrounded by piles of rocks. Beyond the rocks, fruit trees grew scattered over the mountain slope. As she stepped out of the little cottage, Liz’s eyes opened wide: a long wall wandered along the top of the next mountain and stretched into the endless horizon. It was impossible to put her admiration into words— how could she ever describe the beauty and greatness of the masterpiece of ancient Chinese civilisation, the Great Wall? The two-thousand-year-old wall undulated along the edges of steep cliffs, curled around high peaks, and dipped into deep valleys. She imagined soldiers in ancient armour patrolling the walls under scorching summer suns, and sleeping inside the watchtowers during freezing winter nights…
‘Great, isn’t it?’ Fang’s grandfather said.
‘Ah, yes, absolutely,’ Liz pulled her attention back. ‘Are you Shi Sheng’s grand master?’
‘I only taught him a few rounds of Tai Chi movements.’
She thought for a few more seconds. ‘Are you the Frontier Old Man?’ 
‘I’m an old man living at the frontier, and I do have an old horse, but I haven’t lost it yet, so I’m not sure if I qualify as the Frontier Old Man.’ Everyone laughed. ‘From a doctor’s point of view, I need to know certain things in order to apply proper treatment. You don’t need to tell me where, how or by whom you were injured, but I do need to know when, and what kind of treatment you have received since.’
‘Thanks for understanding that I’m unable to tell you many details about myself. I was injured the day before yesterday…’ Liz told him what Henry had done for her, and what her symptoms were; of course she didn’t mention anything related to the vampires or the Long Dream. 
‘I don’t know how and where you gained your power, but I sense strong Qi circulating in your body. Considering your age, it’s impossible for you to have such degree of Qi. I have already said that I don’t need to know about you more than you’re willing to tell me; however, I do notice that you are wearing some kind of mask. Please don’t panic— no one else would ever know about it; the only reason I know is because I applied acupuncture to your face.’
Liz nodded. ‘Thanks.’
‘I managed to stabilise your condition, but I’m unable to get rid of the evil energy within your body. This is not because it is too powerful to be removed; on the contrary, it seems that not much evil energy was there initially.’
Liz had to admire how accurate his diagnosis was. She had only received a tiny cut from the vampire’s dagger.
‘The problem is that the evil energy has mixed up with your Qi, and this increases its power. As long as you don’t use your Qi, the evil energy within your body will not be able to cause trouble for you.’
‘Do you mean I can’t use my Qi anymore?’
‘Each time you use your Qi, the power of the evil energy increases. In the end, it may grow out of your control.’
‘What are the consequences then?’
‘The evil energy will take over your mind and your body; you’ll become an evil monster.’
‘How long do I have before it’s beyond my control?’
‘Hard to say; it depends on many factors. However, you’ll know it yourself if it happens.’ Grandfather turned around and signed Liz to follow him. He walked downhill and stopped beside a heavy, moss-covered pile of rock. 
‘I’m unable to cure the evil energy for you, but I can teach you a meditation against it. It’s a very slow process, but if you practise the meditation regularly, you’ll benefit greatly. The method I’m going to teach you is called the Tortoise Hibernation. Tortoises can hibernate and stay alive for a very long time. The ancient Chinese observed Tortoise Hibernation and combined it with Tai Chi meditation, creating this unique meditation method. It can make your heart stop beating but you are still alive.’
‘How is it possible without blood supplying oxygen to the brain?’
‘The Qi keeps you alive.’
For the rest of the day, Liz followed Grandfather’s instructions, practising the Tortoise Hibernation. The technique shared many similarities with the Tai Chi meditation she had learnt from Li Ping, and it was quite easy for her to master the technique; for instance, if she modified the Nine Dragons Diving into the Sea from Tai Chi, then she could reach stage three of the Tortoise Hibernation. By dinnertime, Liz was able to reach stage seven of the meditation. 
Grandfather couldn’t hide his amazement. He was too courteous to ask, but Liz knew that he desperately wanted to know where she had learnt her Tai Chi. She wished she could tell him after all he had done for her, but she couldn’t. 
She wondered if Grandfather had some kind of relationship with Li Ping; there were too many similarities and connections between her Tai Chi and the Tortoise Hibernation for it to be a coincidence. 
‘When you are able to reach the thirteenth level of Tortoise Hibernation, your heart will stop completely and all of your Qi will disappear, and then a new stream of Qi will generate within your body. In this way you can get rid of all of the evil energy inside your body.’
After dinner, while Liz and Grandfather sat at the dinner table in the living area, Fang brought in a teapot and three little round handle-less cups. She poured green tea into each cup and passed them to Grandfather and Liz. 
As Liz withdrew her hand from her pocket where Li’s diary was to use both hands to accept the teacup, a piece of paper from Li’s diary dropped out of her pocket, landing beside Grandfather’s foot. He picked it up to give it back to her, but stopped when he saw the Chinese characters on the paper.
Liz saw them too; they were the four characters of ‘The frontier old man lost his horse’, the emergency help page from Li Ping’s diary that had brought her to the Great Wall.

Paper horses

‘Did you write these characters? They look very graceful and extremely energetic,’ Fang said, leaning over to look.
Liz knew that a person with trained eyes could judge one’s Qi just from looking at the calligraphy he wrote, and she knew Grandfather had a pair of such trained eyes. ‘I wish I could write like that. Unfortunately I haven’t had the power to do so. This was by a friend, and that’s all I can tell you. I hope you understand.’
Grandfather seemed to be making some important decisions in his mind. Finally he said, ‘Firstly I would like to apologise for my disguise as a blind fortune-teller when we first met; but there was a reason for that.’ He sipped his green tea and continued. ‘Last Sunday night, I had a special dream: one of my grand masters from one and a half thousand years ago told me that the magic pen’s new owner would come to seek my help. The dream was short and my grand master didn’t tell me details about when you’d come or what you would look like; however, she did mention that you were young, half Chinese and half foreign, and a girl.’
Last Sunday: that was when Liz and her friends had the Long Dream. Liz was very interested to hear what Grandfather had to say next.
‘I did an I Ching prediction and the result told me the time you’d arrive at Beijing airport, and that’s how Shi Sheng met you there. He picked you up after you dropped your pen.’
That explained the airport part, Liz thought.
‘But you don’t look half Chinese and half foreign, so I had to pretend to be the blind fortune-teller so I could feel if you wore some kind of mask. That was lucky, because I sensed your illness and gave Shi Sheng the medicine ball to keep you going for a while, and also gave you the special tea at the restaurant at the long-distance bus stop; otherwise, you’d have died before you got here.’
It was lucky, but Liz didn’t say anything.
‘The attack on the way here gave us an opportunity to test your knowledge about the Rock Formation, but it seems you know nothing about them, so I was not sure if you were the person my grand master indicated. However this piece of paper confirms you’re the one, because no one in this world is able to write like that — it’s no doubt my grand master’s handwriting.’
So that explained why so many strangers were willing to help her! Li Ping was his grand master. Liz was wondering if he knew that his grand master had been living in Australia for a while. ‘Thank you very much for trusting me and helping me, but I’m still unable tell you more than I have already.’
‘That’s all right. When do you have to leave?’
 ‘I have to be at the airport no later than 8 o’clock tomorrow night.’ 
Grandfather nodded. He calculated on his fingers for a while. ‘If that’s the case, we have lots to do before you leave.’
Liz noticed that his expression became heavy after the calculation. He took out a paper cut-out of a horse, black in colour, and put it on the table. Liz picked it up and looked at it closely; it felt like paper, but strong and thick, almost like some kind of ultra-thin leather. She put it back on table. ‘What is it?’
Grandfather picked it up. ‘Please follow me.’ 

A breeze blew over the hilltop, cool and pleasant. The night sky looked different from the sky in Australia; Liz was surprised at how bright the moon and stars were.
Grandfather chanted a few words in Mandarin, and then shouted quietly, ‘Ji!’
A black horse appeared, as if it had jumped out of a crack in the ground. Under the moon and stars it was silk and black silver; the saddle on its back and the bridle gleamed. Liz fell in love with it instantly.
‘Give it a go.’ Grandfather said.
Liz had hardly any horse riding experience, apart from yesterday’s involuntary horseback experience, the last time she sat on a saddle was six years ago during a family holiday. At that moment, Liz was amazed by her own action: she jumped off the ground, landing in the saddle as gently as a feather, rode away as easy and confident as if she had ridden a horse for her whole life. Fang applauded, and Grandfather smiled. 
After riding a few circles among the rocks, Liz dismounted. ‘It’s the most handsome horse I’ve seen in my life.’
Grandfather muttered some words; the horse disappeared. He opened his palm and there lay the paper horse.
‘What a magic horse! Please teach me how to activate it.’
So Grandfather taught Liz how to activate and deactivate the magic horse. After Liz tried the Far Shu a few times and was able to do it confidently, he handed over two more paper horses, one white and one chestnut.

Back inside the cottage, Grandfather went to his bedroom and came back with a silk-wrapped parcel. Inside were a neat bundle of black clothing, and a flash of red and white at the bottom of the parcel. Grandfather lifted out a black top, a Gong Fu-style tunic, and shook the creases out. A faint fragrance of strange spices tantalised Liz’s nose. ‘Try it on and see if it suits you.’
Liz stared at the row of golden buttons, wondering how long it would take her to do them all up; but as she shrugged herself into the tunic, it buttoned itself; it also shrank to fit her. Liz was speechless. 
‘As you can see, these are no ordinary clothes. They are woven from thousand-year-old spider silk soaked in magic herb potions for a hundred years. They have many magic properties, as you will find out for yourself.’
He showed her the rest of the bundle. There were three sets of black clothes: tunic top, loose trousers, leather boots, and leather gloves; there were also three capes, each a different colour: black, white and red. 
‘It’s quite late,’ Grandfather said. ‘Before we go to sleep, I’d like to give you one last item.’ 
Liz really could not imagine what more he could give her. 
Grandfather went inside his bedroom again, and came back with a box. Accepting the box from him, she opened the lid. Inside were countless paper cut figures. They held ancient weapons, wore ancient armour, and some of them were riding horses. She asked if they were magical soldiers, activated by Far Shu. Yes, Grandfather smiled sadly, they were magic soldiers.
Liz almost cried out; this must be the magic army Li Ping had called upon to combat the monsters. Unfortunately, Li Ping never got a chance to use them. But how could her magic army be here?
Grandfather was speaking. ‘…but unfortunately nobody has been able to activate them over the last one and half thousand years.’
‘Do you mean that this magic army is over a thousand years old?’
‘Yes. They are as old as the magic clothes and paper horses I just gave you. They all belonged to the three magic warriors, the Wind and Dust Jian Ke Trinity.’ 
Grandfather fell silent for a few seconds. ‘The reason they haven’t been activated for over a thousand years is because nobody has had sufficient Qi to do it. You may want to take them with you. One day you may be able to work out a way of using them. Listen: this is the Far Shu to activate them.’ He spoke the words and Liz repeated them, burning them deep into her memory. The Far Shu was simple enough to remember—it was the Qi required that really mattered.
Grandfather put the box on top of the pile of clothes, and tied a knot on the silk parcel. ‘Don’t worry about its size. You can reduce it.’ He mumbled some Mandarin and the parcel shrank to the size of a mobile phone. Liz was beginning to feel less surprised at such magic. She accepted the small parcel and slipped it in her pocket.
But she wondered: Li Ping did not actually have this magic army when she fought the monsters; the only logical explanation was that she painted their images using the magic pen, to deceive the enemy. As Liz was pondering this, Grandfather spoke again.
‘We had better all go to bed and have a good sleep. Tomorrow we have lots to do.’
Liz walked with Fang to her bedroom. ‘Where are you going to sleep?’ she asked, staring at the single narrow bed in the room.
‘It’s not a problem.’ Fang took a roll of bamboo-woven matting from a corner of the room, and unrolled it on the clay floor. ‘This is very cool and comfortable. Good night.’
Liz was surprised how it could possibly be comfortable. The bed, which was a bamboo matting laid directly over timbers, felt as cosy as a flat rock. In spite of this she was asleep as soon as she closed her eyes.

Something woke her. A tiny beam of light came through the wall near her head. Putting one eye close to the tiny gap, Liz saw Grandfather standing in the living room holding a candle. 
After listening for a while, he put the candle on the dining table and took down a worn-out poster of a smiling fat baby boy riding on a large fish that hung on the wall; underneath was a silk hanging with three portraits. The female face was Li Ping’s. One of the men she had never seen before, but Liz found the male portrait on Li’s left looked oddly familiar. It took her a few seconds to work it out. He looked like her father, strangely familiar and yet strangely different.
Grandfather murmured, ‘I hope I have made the right decision. Please forgive me if it is not, my grand masters.’
Liz’s mind buzzed. If her father was one of the Jian Ke, how could Li Ping not have recognised him after knowing him for so many years? Besides, he would have to be over a thousand years old, and Liz knew it was impossible; he was 45, according to his birth certificate and also confirmed by her grandma, her father’s mother. Surely it was a pure coincidence! Even ignoring the age problem, how could anybody imagine that her father was a Tai Chi grand master? He was relatively fit and played soccer and other sports with her and Henry sometimes, but he did not know anything about Gong Fu or Tai Chi. Liz laughed at herself. How could she even consider the possibility? It was probably a trick of the candlelight, that was all. Liz closed her eyes and was fast sleep in no time. 
24
Rock Piles

When Liz woke again, Fang was nowhere to be seen. She got up, quickly dressed and went outside. 
Under the raising morning sun, Fang and her grandfather were practising Tai Chi. it was beautiful to see their graceful movements against the background of the green valley and the Great Wall curling across the mountaintops. Although this was only the third day she had spent in China, Liz felt that she had lived here her whole life. She felt as if she had always known Grandfather, Fang, the taxi driver, the spout-less magic pot waiter and the spinning fairy—even the landscape, despite it being so different from dry, red Australia. Liz turned her attention to the Tai Chi.
To untrained eyes, all Tai Chi may look the same, but different schools of Tai Chi are quite different indeed; their methods of mind control, their movements, the sequences, are all unique. Watching Fang and her grandfather, Liz compared them with what she had learned from Li Ping: extremely similar, if not identical.
Grandfather and Fang stopped. ‘Did you have a good sleep last night?’
‘Yes, I feel much better. Thanks again for your help.’
‘Fang, it’s such a beautiful morning. Why don’t the two of you do some horse-riding among the rocks?’
‘What a great idea; I haven’t been riding for quite a long time.’
When they were mounted, Grandfather said, ‘Fang, why don’t you follow her in, and later she can follow you out?’ Fang nodded, and signalled Liz to go first.
Liz trotted ahead, passing a few piles of rocks and then many more. Fang followed closely.
When Liz had looked at them before, they had seemed to be heaps of huge rocks randomly scattered on the slope of the mountain, but as she rode among them they seemed to grow larger and taller. In a few minutes she was completely lost, unable to see either the cottage or the surrounding mountains, as if either she had shrunk to the size of an ant or the piles had grown into mountains. Liz turned. ‘Fang, is this a magic rock maze?’
‘I don’t know if maze is the right term; we call it the Rock Formation.’ 
‘Could you please lead me out of here?’
‘That’s what my grandfather told me to do before we came in.’
Liz followed Fang, making many turns, and finally they were out. Turning back, she saw the rock piles were the same as before. 
‘Grandfather, in the west, mazes are generally made of walls or hedges, and people can easily get lost within the complicated patterns of walled paths, but how is it possible to get lost among these rock piles?’
‘People get lost here in the same way they get lost in a large forest.’
‘But there aren’t as many rock piles as trees in a forest for people to get lost in.’
‘Ah.’ He dipped his head in agreement. ‘These rocks are not randomly scattered, but arranged in such way that they form extremely powerful forces; as a result, for those trapped inside, both the number and the size of the piles are almost infinite.’
‘So that’s why I felt they were like mountains.’
‘Three hundred and sixty one piles of rocks, arranged according to Tai Chi Nine Palace and Yin Yang patterns—believe it or not, this Rock Formation is capable of trapping a hundred thousand soldiers.’ 
Liz suddenly thought of something. ‘Are the rock piles I went through on the way here Rock Formation as well?’
‘Yes, they are. You were lucky that they were not activated. Formation theories have been around in China for thousands of years. Of course, the theories behind the formations go beyond just arranging a group of rocks; for example, Feng Shui is one simple application.’
Grandfather paused, checking if Liz was following. Liz nodded, so he continued. ‘The formation theories include some fundamental knowledge, such as the I Ching, Five-Element theory, Yin Yang theory, Eight Directions and Nine-Palace theory, Enchanted Gate theory and so on. Formation theory can be applied not only to rocks, but also to soldiers; it’s called military formation.’ 
As she listened, Grandfather explained how to apply the formation theory to battles. She had an odd feeling that she already knew what he was talking about, that she had learnt about it long ago—but how could she have learned it and then forgotten it until now? She had almost died inside the rocks. Only remembering her father’s story had saved her. Nothing had reminded her of these strange hidden memories uncoiling in her mind as Grandfather spoke.
She guessed that it had something to do with the way Li had empowered her and Henry and Sue, sort of artificially implanting memories and power into them during the Long Dream. Li’s unexpected departure meant that the memories hadn’t been organised properly. Perhaps they only remembered things when something triggered the memory. She recalled how she had known about the eight immortal drunken fists she had used fighting the backpack killers. She had even known the name. Liz was very pleased that she could remember the formation theories now, even though they would have been useful the day before yesterday—better late than never.
It took Grandfather until well after lunchtime to finish the explanations of the formation applications. ‘Are the fruit trees a formation as well?’ Liz pointed to the trees around the hill.
‘Yes, they are the wooden energy formation. We don’t have time to learn it today. Do you want to try the Rock Formation again and see if you can ride out by yourself?’
Liz rode into the rock piles again, and this time she went alone.
Even though the piles still looked like mountains, she could now identify the different paths and gates inside the formation; for instance, if she went through one of the eight life-gates, such as Blue Dragon Turning Its Head or Flying Bird Falling from Its Nest, then she knew the path led to a safe way out. On the other hand, if she went through one of the eight death gates, such as Red Sparrow Diving into River or White Tiger Turning Crazy, then she’d never get out of the formation again.
Liz rode slowly, trying to apply the theory to the practice; gradually, she could see the gates and their energy properties. Following the life-gates, she rode out of the formation.
‘Well done!’ Fang applauded.
‘You’re the fastest learner I’ve ever taught,’ Grandfather smiled. Suddenly he looked up and frowned. Following his eyes, Liz saw a thick beam of black smoke emerge from a watchtower on the Great Wall; a few faint smudges of smoke appeared further along the Great Wall in the distance.
‘Beacons!’ Fang shouted.
Grandfather quickly counted with his fingers, looking very serious. ‘I knew the enemy was coming but didn’t expect them so soon.’
‘What enemy?’ Fang asked. ‘Grandfather, do you know who they are?’
‘No, I don’t, but one thing is certain: they are not Chinese.’
‘I had better go,’ Liz said. ‘I think they’ve come after me. I don’t want to get you involved.’
‘There is no time to discuss that now; they will arrive at the fruit trees in a few minutes. Fang, take her and hide in the gate of the Blue Dragon Turning Its Head, and activate the Rock Formation. You will know when. Promise you won’t come back no matter what happens to me.’ He paused. ‘Go now!’
Tears rolled down Fang’s cheeks; she said nothing, and after gazing at her grandfather for a few seconds she dragged Liz back to the cottage. She picked up Liz’s passport and wallet. ‘Have you got the silk parcel?’
‘Yes,’ said Liz, feeling it in her pocket. 
‘Come.’ Her actions were swift, her expression sad, serious and concentrated. She pulled a wooden sword from under her bed and pulled Liz out of the house.
Liz was not used to being hauled around without explanation, but she said nothing until Fang dragged her to the first of the rock piles. Then she could keep silence no longer. ‘Wait a minute—I don’t want to just leave like this; at least I should say goodbye to your grandfather.’
‘There is no time for that. He has said goodbye to you.’ Fang tugged Liz inside. Her strength was amazing considering how slender her body was. Liz didn’t resist. They walked swiftly past a few rock piles and Fang motioned her to stop behind a large one. ‘We can watch from here and nobody will see us,’ Fang said.
There were a few gaps between the rocks, so Liz could see what happened in front of the cottage. She estimated that they were about fifty metres away. Holding a wooden sword in his right hand and a chicken in the other, Grandfather shouted something at the sky. It was too far away for Liz to hear his words, but it had the aura of some kind of Far Shu, she felt. He used the wooden sword to cut the chicken’s throat, and blood shot high in the air. Liz closed her eyes. She then heard his voice, deep and loud, clear, like thunder rumbling.
‘Ji Ji Wo Lu…Ling!’
Turning her gaze down the mountain slope, Liz spotted a group of strangely dressed figures speeding towards the fruit trees. They wore strange silvery uniforms and helmets, like spacemen’s suits, each carrying a backpack. Soon the group reached the fruit trees.
Green fog swelled above the treetops. Through the thinly spaced trees, Liz was able to see the uniformed figures walk backward and forward, as if they didn’t know where to go. They must have become lost inside the magic tree formation as she had among the rock piles. One of the uniformed figures took out a bright red ball, tossing it ahead of him; a blinding red ball of light exploded in the air, and red smoke started to spread and merge with the green fog. 
Fang gasped. Liz turned swiftly and saw Grandfather falling to the ground; his white beard and the front of his clothes were crimson. Liz made to go to, but Fang dragged her back down and shook her head firmly. Her face was filled with anger. She bit her bottom lip so hard that Liz could see blood on it.
They watched the group of attackers emerged from the trees, advancing on Grandfather. Stopping in front of him, they took off their helmets. They were the backpack killers who had killed Professor Smith and chased Liz all the way from Perth to China. 
Struggling hard, Grandfather managed to sit in a meditation position. The group of attackers surround him and watched curiously, while the leader wandered towards the cottage.
White smoke rose from Grandfather’s head. Liz’s heart pumped; she remembered the San Gong Far Shu in Li’s diary. Did Grandfather know how to use it, and was he applying it right now?
Suddenly Grandfather’s voice echoed in her head, just like Sue talked to her in her head in Kings Park. ‘Please send my best regards to my grand masters, from their forty-ninth grand disciple, Li Shi.’ 
Grandfather raised his wooden sword with both hands, eyes wide open, and roared. ‘Ji!’ The sword exploded; a sphere of red fog billowed out, engulfing the attackers. 
‘Grandfather!’ Liz’s tears poured out. She looked back at Fang. 
Fang raised her sword and sprayed a mouthful of blood on its wooden blade. She shouted. ‘Ji Ji Wo Lu…Ling!’
As the ground started shaking around her and the rocks grew larger and taller, Liz knew Fang had activated the Rock Formation. 
‘No time to cry now,’ Fang told her. Liz wiped her eyes, ashamed. Would she ever be able to control herself as well as Fang? ‘We need horses,’ Fang said.
Liz brought out two paper horses and spoke the Far Shu over them, and the two girls rode towards the deep end of the rock piles.

Following Fang, Liz rode silently in the darkness. Grandfather’s last image appeared in her mind over and over again. At the instant when Grandfather had sacrificed himself to save her, something happened inside her that had changed her forever. Thinking back, she knew what it was—she felt proud of her Chinese heritage. She no longer felt embarrassment about her father’s folk stories. She would never be bored by them again. How much she longed to see her dad and tell him everything that had happened to her in China!
Gradually, the city lights blinked into view. They rode through a large crop field and came to a motorway. Liz deactivated the paper horses and put them in her pocket. 
The two girls looked at each other in silence for a while. Finally Fang spoke. ‘There is a taxi over there waiting for you. You should be able to get to the airport on time.’
‘Fang, I promise you that I’ll get these backpack killers and avenge your grandfather.’
‘I forgot to tell you. My grandfather’s last words to me were to ask me not to avenge him.’
‘Why?’ Liz asked.
‘He didn’t believe in revenge. He always said that there is no absolute evil, and revenge will not solve a problem. I don’t agree with him on this point but I will obey his last words.’
‘Revenge or not, these backpack killers have to be stopped. What are you going to do, Fang?’
‘This is my homeland. I can handle myself.’
‘Will we see each other again?’
‘I don’t know, but I hope we do.’ She touched Liz briefly on the arm, and faded into the darkness.
Climbing into the taxi, Liz saw Shi Sheng behind the steering wheel. ‘I’m so sorry …’ Liz was unable to finish her sentence.
‘He was a very good man.’ Shi Sheng looked grim.

Inside the plane cabin, Liz watched the TV news. In a small country town in a remote area of Western Australia, dozens of people had gone missing. Police strongly denied foolish rumours that they had been abducted by monsters after an explosion at Wave Rock last Saturday. 
‘Not foolish—not rumours,’ Liz murmured to herself. She had no idea what she would do when she got back. During the whole flight, she prayed that she would not be too late.
25
Meditation

‘Have you heard the rumours about the monsters?’ the taxi driver asked in strongly accented English. 
Liz was on her way home from Perth airport. ‘Yes, I heard a dozen people are missing.’
‘If I were you, I wouldn’t choose to have a holiday in Perth right now.’
‘Thanks for the advice, except I’m not having holiday. I’m coming home.’
She directed the driver to Kings Park, where she checked the hideout. There was a note in the hole of the large tree. In order to stop further mining operations, earlier this morning Sue and Henry had gone with Fred and other EPP members to Wave Rock.
She felt lost. She had never thought that Henry and Sue wouldn’t be waiting for her. What should she do? Thinking for a moment, she decided to see her father. There were so many things she wanted to ask him. But she felt dizzy. She knew the evil energy within her body was active again. Immediately she sat against the tree, starting the tortoise hibernation meditation. As her Qi diminished, she felt the dizziness and pain slowly fade away. Then she heard noises; someone was walking towards her. 
Instantly she became alert, but half way through the meditation, she was unable to move. She wished she could become invisible. 
Three people came into sight; one of them was the leader of the backpack killers. How stupid and careless she was, doing the meditation like this! This would be the end of everything; she would be killed, evil monsters would freely wander the streets, Henry and Sue would struggle against the monsters hopelessly until their deaths, her parents, Fred and thousands of innocents would be slaughtered… Closing her eyes, Liz waited for the last moment.
‘I don’t see anybody here.’
Liz couldn’t believe her ears. She opened her eyes a slit and saw the killers only a couple of metres away. How could they not see her? Was this a joke, or a cat and mouse game? She quickly looked down in case they noticed her eyes moving, and barely suppressed a gasp. She had found the answer: her clothes against the tree had changed into tree bark, and against the ground her shoes and trousers were red and earthy. She blended into the background so well that nobody would be able to find her unless they touched her. What about her face? Had her face changed to the colour of tree bark as well? Since they didn’t see her, she assumed the answer was yes.
How could this have happened? Grandfather had told her the Jian Ke clothes had magic properties, but they were still in her pocket; had they somehow got on her when she made her wish? She dearly wanted to put her hand in her pocket and find out if the Jian Ke clothes were still there, but she knew instinctively she could not make one tiny movement.
‘No way; we all saw her walking in this direction,’ the killer leader’s voice replied.
‘My unit registers nothing of supernatural power around.’ The first one showed others his wristwatch. 
So these killers traced them by detecting their supernatural power, not from the scent they left behind! Liz guessed that the Tortoise Hibernation meditation had reduced her power to next to nothing. But hadn’t they tracked down Henry and Sue then? 
‘Your unit only works on certain types of supernatural power, not hers.’ He pointed directly at Liz, his finger only centimetres from her face. Liz shuddered. He turned back to the wristwatch man. ‘Forget about her. The rest will be finished at the mine site today.’
‘Terry, why do we have to help the Vampire King? Apart from his vampire army, there are thousands of animal monsters, surely they could manage to kill a few hundred protesters.’ The wristwatch person asked. Liz was surprised that an extraterrestrial had such an ordinary name.
‘After the Chinese woman injured the Vampire King, the monsters ran away and hid, so we can’t really depend on them to do anything.’ Terry paused, and gave an unpleasant laugh. ‘I may be able to make some use of these cowardly stupid, monsters.’
‘How will you find their hiding place?’
‘That’s not the difficult part—anyway, back to the Vampire King; I helped him recover from his injury, but he’s still too scared of the Chinese woman to come out of his hiding place. I have assured him that if the Chinese women and her army come out today they will be eliminated, so he’s finally agreed to attack the protesters at the mine site today.’
‘Why bother with the mine site? Wouldn’t it be easier just to come to the city?’
‘The mine site is close to his hiding place, and that’s how far he is willing to go. He is an absolutely useless ally.’
 ‘Why do we do all this? From Europe to Australia to China, we have killed so many people who possess supernatural powers, and released ancient evil monsters into the world, and now we even assist vampires to slaughter innocent people.’
‘Ronald, you know that we have to get the rocks underground here in Western Australia to save our own people, don’t you?’
‘No, I don’t.’
Terry gave an impatient snort. ‘Have you ever watched the news or heard people talking about issues?’
‘I’m only a military guy, I know nothing else but to do my duty; I don’t know why I was sent to Europe to kill the professors.’ Ronald had a short haircut and a sleek body build. His face looked a bit unusual, and watching him gave Liz the feeling of looking at a leopard.
‘You didn’t do your duty very well. I had to help you finished your mission.’
‘We killed most of them—only a handful escaped.’
‘Ronald, do you call a dozen highly trained, extremely powerful, knowledgeable professors a handful? They could have seriously damaged our plan if I hadn’t eliminated them for you.’
‘OK, Terry, you helped me, and now I’ve returned your favour. After you lost your whole unit in China, I dragged all of my men from Europe to help you out…’
That was the only good news for Liz since the beginning of the nightmare. At each encounter she had always had to run away, escaping from the backpack killers’ pursuit. Thanks to Grandfather’s self-sacrifice, they had had to pull out their troops in Europe, so now Professor Brown might be able to come and help them soon.
‘All right, I helped you out, and now you’re helping me, so we’re even.’
‘Man, it sucks —how could you lose your whole unit in China?’
‘I don’t want to talk about it.’
‘Do they have more powerful weapons than ours?’
‘Drop it, do you hear me? I don’t want to talk about it now!’
‘Be cool, man. OK, tell me why we have to save our own people and what these rocks can do for us.’
Terry walked a bit closer to Ronald and lowered his voice. ‘We have almost used up all our energy resources on USB. In twenty years’ time, we’ll have nothing to power our world. Can you imagine what it means to have no power?’ Liz had no idea what USB was.
Ronald thought for a few seconds. ‘Do you mean we’d have to live in the Stone Age?’
‘Yes, but that is only the minor problem.’
‘Man, tell me what the major problem is. You know I’m a doer, not a thinker.’
‘The problem is,’ Terry stopped, scanning around. Liz felt his eyes look past her a few times. Her heart pounded. Fortunately, Terry spoke again. ‘The problem is that all our enemies will come after us as soon as they know we’ve run out of power.’
‘Oh man, that is a problem. The enemy from D33 will come after me for sure, considering how many I killed there last month. So these rocks have the power we need?’ What was D33 Liz wondered.
‘Yes, the rocks here have very high power properties, and could keep us powered for another fifty years.’
‘Then what happens after fifty years?’
‘We’ll find rocks somewhere else, in another world.’
‘Since we’ve found the rocks here, why don’t we just dig them out and take them back home? What’s the problem?’
‘Ronald, you do know what this is?’ Terry said, and took a red marble-sized ball from his backpack. His hand disappeared inside the backpack as if it was not a solid object but an image. That was the best way Liz could describe it. 
‘Of course I know it, man. I’m not an idiot. It’s our energy ball.’
‘Right. Do you know how many rocks are required to produce just one of these balls?’
‘Just tell me, man.’
Terry paused, staring at the little ball on his palm. ‘It needs ten trucks of normal rocks to produce just one. Tell me, how many energy balls in your backpack?’
‘Hundreds? Thousands? I’ve never counted them.’
‘It’ll need a pile of rocks the size of a hill to produce enough balls to fill up your backpack, and that’s why we can’t just take the rocks home.’
‘So we process them here, and then take the energy balls home?’
‘The rock processing will poison the environment, and kill people and animals in these areas.’
‘That’s not our problem. Who cares?’
‘It is our problem. Our people are obsessed with Being Rights and environmental consequences, so we have no chance of processing the rock here.’
‘Why can’t we process the rocks somewhere else, like in D33? There’s a war there, and nobody cares about the consequences.’
‘These rocks need to be processed immediately they are mined, so we have no choice but to process them here. Ronald, can you think of a connection between the rocks and the monsters?’
After thinking for a while but without coming up with anything, Ronald kicked a little stone so hard that Liz heard it whistle past her ear. She hoped he wouldn’t kick another one; a few drops of blood might reveal where she was. Luckily, Ronald spoke again. ‘Man, I can’t see what the rocks have to do with vampires.’
Terry spoke slowly and patiently, as if explaining something simple to a five-year-old. ‘If we release the ancient evil monsters and make sure they can’t be destroyed by anyone on earth, they’ll create chaos and disaster here; when people are being slaughtered and enslaved by the monsters, we can come and be their only salvation.’ Terry raised his voice and appeared very excited. ‘Then, our media will shut up about Being Rights and environmental consequences and we’ll have no problem sending our army and openly mining here.’
‘Man, I’d never think that deep!’ Ronald paused. ‘I’ve killed many people but they were all enemies, armed soldiers. If we do what you just said, millions of innocent humans could be slaughtered. Wouldn’t that make us worse than the monsters?’ 
‘Humans slaughter millions of other creatures for their consumption each day; has anybody called them evil? Have any of our Being Rights activists tried to prevent Being Rights abuse on Earth? No! We collected evidence for almost a whole century and reported to our government, but they’ve done nothing. So in order to do great good, sometimes one has to engage with evil. What we’re doing is no worse than what humans do to other creatures.’
‘All right, I accept that we’re doing this for the greater good. Do you think that Chinese woman will spoil the party again today?’ 
Gradually, Liz was beginning to realise that they were not extraterrestrials as portrayed in science fiction novels and movies, but human beings with advanced technology, or at least that they had some connection with Earth humans.
‘All necessary precautions have been taken to make sure things go as smoothly as planned. If the Chinese woman joins the party, she will be eliminated. If she doesn’t appear, the Vampire King and his soldiers will have a good time enjoying fresh blood from the protesters at the mine site today, and thousands more in the city tomorrow, so either way our plan is fail-proof. We have to go now.’
And they left.

Liz waited for ten minutes, before slowly coming out of the hibernation. Now she knew two of the backpack killer leaders’ names, Terry and Ronald, and knew that they were after some kind of rock here in Western Australia. It seemed that the rocks were so important that they were willing to kill any number of innocent people.
Where did Terry say they were going to go? Suddenly, her stomach sank: they were going to the mine site. Liz took Henry and Sue’s note out: the protest at the mine site would start around lunchtime.
Her watch told her that it was only nine thirty. Her magical horse would get her to the mine site before lunchtime. 
She ran out of the bush, one hand feeling in her pocket for the paper horse, and then stopped abruptly.
Standing in the wide tree-less corridor between the thick bushes, Terry and his men were waiting for her.
26
Out of the City

‘I thought we’d have to wait much longer. I suppose you’re in a hurry to save your fellow activists,’ Terry said.
Liz didn’t need to look back to know that Terry’s men were behind her. Terry wouldn’t hesitate to kill her this time, so the question was why hadn’t he? Liz could only think of one reason: Terry had followed her to China and back but had not killed her because he wanted to know where Li Ping was. 
‘I overheard your conversation just then. We may be able to work something out more intelligently, rather than in the primitive way—slaughtering people.’ Liz’s Qi was slowly rebuilding, and she needed to stall time in order to gain her strength.
Terry’s face stiffened for a moment. ‘You didn’t ‘overhear’ our conversation. It was performed for you specially. Now you should realise what you are up against. You can’t win against USB; nobody can.’
‘USB? Is that the name of the world you come from? What does it stand for?’ Keep him talking, keep stalling. 
‘USB stands for the Universe of Supreme Beings; it’s the universe we’re from, a highly civilised world, unlike primitive Earth. Now, tell me who the Chinese woman is and where she is, so we can all be saved a lot of trouble.’
‘If I tell you what you want to know, what kind of assurance do I have that you won’t just kill me?’
Ronald walked a step closer and spoke slowly. ‘I promise we won’t kill you if you tell us what we want. As you know, we have very sophisticated Being Rights laws in our world.’
‘You’ve killed many people already, so I don’t see why you would spare my life.’ 
‘You know we’re not evil, killing people for the fun of it. We’re sorry for the people who died. We tried to get their co-operation, but most unfortunately they started to attack us, so in self-defence…’ Terry began. 
He was interrupted by Ronald. ‘If you’re not armed, we can’t kill you. It’s against our law.’
Liz felt her Qi steadily building up, but she needed a bit longer. ‘So if I co-operate with you, and don’t attack you, then you won’t need to kill me in self-defence; therefore I have no need to die. Am I right?’
‘Yes, absolutely; you’re a very intelligent girl. Why should I want to kill you?’ Terry sounded almost excited.
‘OK, let me tell you who the Chinese woman is. Her name is… Hang on, I’ve thought of something else.’
‘What?’
Seeing the eager expression on Terry’s face, Liz almost laughed aloud. ‘I know so much of your plan now, how can you trust me not tell anyone?’
Terry laughed too quickly. ‘Oh, we have very high magic technology, so we can erase that memory in your head, and you won’t remember a thing. To use one of your expressions, ignorance is bliss.’
Liz’s Qi was not only back, but more powerful than before her injury—the result of the Tortoise Hibernation meditation, she guessed. She gazed ahead as if thinking. Terry was seven or eight metres away, and her whip could reach up to nine metres, so with some luck she might be able to whip a gap and get away. 
She needed to go east and save her friends.
She slumped her shoulders and gave a resigned laugh. ‘In that case, I…’ As the group around her relaxed, Liz pulled out her dragon whisker pen in one slick arm-slinging movement and flashed it at her enemy; she leaped sideways without even thinking.
While still in the air, she saw Terry withdraw his weapon in a smooth move, but Ronald was faster. Liz was never quite sure what happened next; she saw Ronald bounce Terry’s weapon sidewards and shoot a red spark at her whip. 
It felt as if her arm had been hit by a train. Her whip flew out of her hand and landed at Terry’s feet. 
‘What are you doing?’ Terry shouted at Ronald.
‘There’s no need to kill her.’ Ronald turned to Liz. ‘You’re quick. Where did you learn to move like that? I wish I could have hand-to-hand combat with you some time.’
Liz eyed him cautiously. The back of her mind was busy, telling her that she had just used a Five Predator Tai Chi. As she had found in China, when the need arose, she reacted automatically. She assumed this was a result of Li Ping’s special Far Shu that had empowered her during the Long Dream.
Terry snorted. He picked Liz’s whip up and examined it. ‘Well, I have to say I underestimated your value to us. We have decoded most European witchcraft, but haven’t paid much attention to the Chinese forms yet.’
‘What do we do now?’ Ronald asked.
‘Kill her. I don’t think we’ll get any useful information from her.’ 
‘She’s unarmed. We can’t kill her now. I can try to get information from her,’ Ronald looked quite excited, and was ready to launch at Liz.
‘Don’t bother. My whole unit surrounded her in China but was unable to catch her—some kind of tricky martial arts. If you are unable to kill her, I’ll do it for you.’ Terry raised his torch-weapon.
‘No, you can’t, Terry, it’s against the law,’ Ronald shouted.
‘What a lot of rubbish. Law? This is not the USB, and we have to look after ourselves in the battlefield.’ His weapon was pointed straight at Liz, and all she could see was the dark eye at the end that would blink red sparks and end her. She knew it was too late for her to duck to avoid the hit. 
It was odd: she didn’t feel terribly scared. She kept her eyes wide, staring at Terry’s weapon; she wanted to see the spark that would kill her.
A bright blue spark shot out of the bush behind Terry, striking his right arm. It was torn off below his elbow and fell on the ground, together with his weapon. Terry dropped the whip, held his wounded arm and howled.
Liz threw herself to the ground instantly.
More blue sparks shot out. Screams burst around her. Rolling over, and over again, Liz grabbed the tip of her whip. She lifted her head slightly and quickly assessed the situation. Two more men were bleeding on the ground, and the rest were firing red sparks into the bushes. Nobody was paying attention to her any more. She flung her whip forwards and hit the head of a man. He went down.
Ronald took out a ball and threw it in the air. It exploded, creating thick grey smoke that spread over the open ground. 
Liz rolled sidewards under the heavy smoke circling her whip to spin a protective net above her. For a few seconds she could see less than a metre in front, then a sudden gust of wind lifted the smoke away and she could see again. There was no sign of Terry or his men. Even the injured ones had disappeared. A groan from inside the bushes, plus the evidence of broken branches, told Liz where her rescue sparks had come from. 
She rushed into the bush. Professor Smith half sat against a tree trunk covered with burn scars and deep black holes, as if it had been struck a thousand times by lightning. 
‘Professor Smith…’ Staring at his blood-covered front, Liz didn’t know where to start.
‘Don’t waste time on me. You need to go now…take this with you.’ He passed a blood-covered object to her. ‘It’s a diamond… special powers. It has been… keeping me breathing… but no longer... Keep it close… to your heart… it may save you …These killers… too powerful… run… save yourself…’ His head flopped sideways.
Her tears flowed silently. Then she remembered Fang’s resilience, wiped the tears from her cheeks and stood up straight. Professor Smith had died to give her this diamond. She would use it as best she could.
Wiping the blood off the jewel and staring at it, she wondered how it worked. A car horn blaring from the nearby road dragged her thoughts back to the present; in spite of Professor Smith’s instruction to save herself, she had to get to her friends. She had to get to the mine site. She took a last look at the man who had saved her life, and said quietly, ‘Thank you, Professor.’ She ran towards the road.
A white car was parked between two of the eucalyptus trees that edged the roadside; the keys dangled beside the steering wheel. She would have to drive out of the city first, and then ride her horse in the open fields of the countryside. It would cause too much attention to ride on the crowded city streets, along with hundreds of cars.
Liz had never driven before. But how hard could it be? She hesitated for a couple of seconds, then climbed into the driver’s seat and started the engine. 
Liz saw two men tearing around the corner, blocking her way to the road. ‘Get out of my car,’ one shouted.
‘This is a life and death situation, and I have to use your car to save hundreds of people’s lives. I can’t explain it to you now...’
‘Get away from my car!’ One of the men, huge and bulky, with a dark green spider tattoo on his arm, grabbed her roughly and pulled her out of the car.
Liz shifted a few inches, gently laying one hand on his arm; he fell to the ground heavily. ‘I’m sorry we have to solve the problem this way, but I have to go right now.’
His mate, even taller and bigger, dashed at Liz with a football tackle. Twisting her body, Liz watched him rush past her, and then she kicked backward, sending him headfirst into the bushes. Turning around, she was just in time to face the first man, who staggered up and punched at Liz’s head with all his might. A surge of anger surfaced. Liz stood until his fist was almost on her face; then she moved her head sidewards, turning her body. His forward force was so strong that his body rammed into her. She twitched her shoulder up and forward and he flew into the bush, thumping onto his friend who was in the process of climbing up. 
‘Sorry about that, guys; just think you’re doing the community a service.’ 

Liz wasn’t surprised at all that she was able to drive confidently; it was just like discovering that she could fight with Drunk Fists and Five Predator Tai Chi. She wondered what other skills Li had programmed into her brain during the Long Dream. 
As she drove towards the freeway, Professor Smith’s and Terry’s voices echoed inside her head: ‘Too powerful … save yourself…’; ‘You can’t win against USB; nobody can.’ Liz knew clearly that they both were correct—she had no chance of defeating either the backpack killers or the thousands of monsters. When she got to the mine site, she’d not be able to save any of her friends—all she would do was die with them. But what were her options?
Liz really wondered who had helped them when Smith was injured under the bridge. Li Ping could be ruled out, but who else was there? 
The only possible person Liz could come up was her father. Although the idea sounded ridiculous, she wanted to ask him directly. If it really was him in the Jian Ke portrait grandfather had in China, then he could help her activate the paper cut soldiers, the only hope she had of defeating the enemies.
Glancing at her watch, she quickly decided that it was worth wasting valuable minutes to check if he was able to help. Liz turned the car around and headed for the hospital. As she was getting out of the car, she looked in the rear vision mirror, and realised she still had her mask on. She smoothed her hand over her face and became herself, and feeling suddenly shaky at what she might learn, entered the hospital. 
Her father was alone in the four-bed ward. Liz felt like a long-lost child finally coming home; she wanted to tell her father everything that had happened—Li Ping, the Long Dream and the trip to China, her fear, pain, and loneliness. Tears blurred her eyes as she remembered that she couldn’t tell him any of it. 
She forced a smile on her face and blinked the tears out of sight. ‘How have you been, Dad?’ She hugged him hard. 
For a brief moment, Liz thought she saw him nod to her as if he understood everything she was going to say, but of course that was pure imagination. How could he possibly understand what she had been through?
‘I’m all right, the same as when you left not so long ago.’
Liz realised that Sue must have used her mask of Liz to visit her father before leaving for Wave Rock.
It was amazing. Liz no longer felt his voice was dull and boring; he even looked younger. She longed to tell him how his stories had saved her life more than once.
‘What happened?’ he asked her. ‘Has the protest been cancelled?’
Her father’s Chinese-accented English dragged Liz into reality—lying in the hospital bed was a middle aged man with a broken leg. ‘Oh no,’ she replied. ‘I just have a few things to deal with before we head off. Where’s Mum?’
‘She just went home.’
Looking at his weary face and his plastered leg, Liz sighed inwardly; there was no chance he was a disguised Tai Chi grand master. Even if he were, he’d not be able to go anywhere. Still, it was worth a try. No harm in asking… Liz decided to give it a go.
‘Dad, have you heard of the Jian Ke in China a thousand years ago?’ 
‘Are you talking about the Wind and Dust Jian Ke Trinity in the Tong Dynasty? Of course I know the story…’
There was no recognition on his face. Liz bit back her disappointment. ‘Of course, you’ve told me that story a hundred times. Never mind. I think I need to go now. Oh, one last thing—I found this box in a garage sale. It looks Chinese. Do you know what it is?’ As she passing the paper cut soldier box to him, she watched him closely. Please, please say you know it, Liz prayed in her heart.
There was no sudden recognition, no excitement, and no surprise. ‘The box looks ancient, and these paper cut figures look quite nice; they may be for a puppet show …’
‘Dad, I have to go…’
Her father suddenly did something quite extraordinary: his left hand still held the box, but his right hand patted the top of his head. ‘Sometimes my headaches are so bad that they feel like volcano explosions and I wish I could drop a Taishan Mountain on top of my head to crush the headaches.’
Liz sighed. After the experience in China, she had promised to pay attention to every single word he said, but now when she wanted them, there were no Chinese folk tales or old stories, just this strange behaviour he had being performing for her since she was five years old. ‘Dad, I really do have to go, right now. I hope you’ll feel better soon. I love you very much.’ 
She took the box from him, hugging him to say goodbye. Her eyes filled with tears; without the help of the magic paper cut soldiers, she would have no chance to survive the monsters and the backpack killers’ attack. And she would never see her father again.
27
Tornado

Liz drove as fast as she dared through the city towards the east. Passing the familiar river foreshore and her school oval, Liz felt they were so lovely and so memorable. It was strange. She had never looked at these ordinary things in this way until now—maybe the last time she ever would see them.
When she had woken from the Long Dream and realised how dangerous the situation was, she was scared but still felt there must be help somewhere. However even with Henry and Sue, she knew she couldn’t undertake the task of fighting thousands of evil monsters with no other help.
She had thought she was brave going to meet Professor Smith at midnight under the Narrows bridge, brave to communicate with Professor Brown in the internet café, brave to fight vampires in Kings Park and get injured, brave to go all the way to China alone; but always, she had believed that there was help somewhere waiting for her.
Now Liz realised that there would not be any immediate rescue; even if Professor Brown and his comrades made their way to Western Australia one day, all her closest friends and family would be killed long beforehand. She had witnessed so many people sacrifice their lives in order to let others live: Professor Smith, Dr Blanc, Dr Wolfgang and their colleagues, Grandfather… Liz knew now it was her decision time—sacrificing her own life to activate her magic paper cut army. 
She tried to take comfort in the idea that her sacrifice wouldn’t be in vain; however she knew that the paper cut soldiers would not be able to defeat the monsters. But at least they’d scare them a bit, and maybe buy some time to delay the attack on the city; maybe Professor Brown and his comrades would get to Perth in time.
Looking at the hills ahead, Liz suddenly felt a great flame of determination gust through her. Although she had lost all hope of getting help, she felt sure about herself for the first time in her fourteen years of life. She was going to take charge of her own fate. She was going to fight the monsters and the backpack killers.
Aiming at the hilltop ranges, Liz increased the pressure on the accelerator. 

As soon as she had passed the hills and was driving on the highway through farmland, Liz stopped the car and activated her magic horse. He was much faster than a car, and able to take short cuts, crossing farmland, hills, forests, and the vast red desert, rather than follow the roads. 
It was almost 11AM, and she had at least another half hour to go. The vampire army was most likely to attack when the protest began so she had to be there by lunchtime. Despite the whistling wind in her ears, and the way landmarks loomed fast and immediately disappeared behind her, Liz felt she was too slow and urged the horse to go faster—the vampires might be already at the mine site, Henry and Sue could be desperately fighting with the evil creatures right now, and Fred could have been captured by monsters! 
She tried to connect by using their Connected-By-Heart Far Shu to Sue and Henry but had no success.
Finally she saw the half-destroyed Wave Rock and a large group of protesters. There was no sign of vampires.
Breathing out deeply, she searched for Sue and Henry among the protesters. Stopping behind a thick bush, she dismounted her horse, deactivated it, and walked quickly into the crowd. 
There were thousands of protesters from different parties: EPP, ARP, Greens, Mother Earth, and some she didn’t know about. Many families with children had joined the action. The protesters were scattered over a large area at the edge of the forest. A few hundred metres away lay the ruined Wave Rock with a wide, deep hole in the ground in front of it; huge excavating machines stood ready to dig up the area. 
A small group of people faced the protesters. Liz recognised the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and guessed the four other people in smart business suits must be representatives of the mining company.
Someone walked up to the minister. It was Fred. Liz’s heart pounded faster. She stopped in the crowd and watched Fred intensely. 
Holding a megaphone in front of the crowd, Fred spoke clearly and calmly, so exciting and so soothing at the same time that Liz wanted to cry. Following Fred’s speech, the protesters cheered and clapped, and booed the minister and the mine company representatives.
Liz weaved her way through the crowd towards Sue and Henry. She elbowed Henry. 
’Sorry,’ Henry muttered, glancing around; he did a double-take and tugged Sue’s sleeve. Liz signalled them to follow her. 
They gradually manoeuvred themselves into the forest. When the thick bushes shielded them from the crowd, Sue lunged at Liz. ‘I’m so glad you’re back,’ she said, hugging Liz and crying.
‘Tell us what happened.’ Henry hugged Liz in his turn.
‘We don’t have time for that right now. Henry, put on your blond surfing boy’s mask, and Sue, the Irish red hair mask, quick!’ As they smoothed their hands across their faces, she took out the three paper horses, chanted the Mandarin words she had learned from Grandfather, and threw a paper cut-out in front of each of them. A beam of white smoke puffed out of the ground and three handsome horses appeared from nowhere. 
‘Wow! What magic!’ Henry caught the chestnut horse’s reins. ‘Does it have a name?’
‘Of course it has a name. It is called Fireball. Sue, yours is called Snowflake, and mine is Ink-Dust.’ Liz then told Sue and Henry very briefly what she had overheard from Terry this morning. ‘We have to be ready. They could be here any minute.’
As she spoke a hum of red wind curled swiftly towards the protesters. It grew rapidly, gathering dust and dirt, flinging tiny stones at the group and rising from a hum to a scream. The protesters scattered as the wind rose high above them, turning the sky red and catching at hats and roaring. Still growing, it swept through the crowd and spun away along the edge of the forest. The three dusted themselves off. Others around them were straightening their clothes and calling out to each other.
‘Fred! Fred!’ shouted Sue, flicking her head from side to side to find her brother. Liz jumped on her horse to see above the crowd. Where Fred and the minister had been standing was an empty, swept space of clean red dirt. The four business suits were gone; so was the minister; and so was Fred.
‘It’s the monsters, the tornado. Let’s go!’ Liz turned her horse, ready to gallop in the direction the tornado went. 
‘Stop!’ Henry shouted.
‘What’s the matter?’ Liz reined in her horse and turned around.
‘Over there.’ Henry pointed towards the desert.
Under fast-moving dark clouds, a whirl of red dust rose from the horizon, blowing towards them fast; in a few seconds, she could make out individual vampire soldiers running.
Looking from the direction Fred was taken to the fast approaching enemy, and then to the frightened protesters behind, many with crying children, Liz’s felt her brain spin. What to deal with first?
‘We need to do something with these people, Liz!’ Henry shouted.
‘But how can we fight so many with only three of us?’ said Sue.
Liz’s eyes focused on the vampires; they were now only a few kilometres away and closing fast. To fight the vampire army she would have no choice but to use the self-destruction Far Shu to activate her paper cut army—or would she? Liz could hear Li’s voice in her head: ‘Tai Chi does not use force against force…’ But how could she not use force against the vampires if she wanted to save the protesters?
Sweat beaded on her forehead and flowed into her eyes. She used the back of her hand to wipe it off, and as her hand touched her mask, an idea came to her. ‘Sue, go and start a bushfire; the larger the better, so the protesters will be forced away from here. Henry, come with me.’ As Liz changed her mask to Li Ping’s face she saw Sue fly into action, capable now that someone was taking charge. Sue activated her Yin Yang Rings and twisted her arm, and the golden ring launched into the air with a glitter of golden sparks; a moment later, the silvery ring flew in the opposite direction. The rings curved and swept back, colliding over the forest; showers of sparks cascaded into the treetops. The dry, oil-filled trees exploded into flames. 
The protesters, faced with another danger, gathered up their children and dropped their placards and ran. Within minutes they had all been driven away, out of the danger zone. Liz gave Sue a thumbs-up.
The vampire army was only fifty metres away. Liz mounted her horse and Henry and Sue followed her into the choking black smoke and red blaze. The three sat on their horses quietly as the vampire army drew near.
The sea of black soldiers stopped; there seemed many more than Liz remembered. The Vampire King stepped forward. ‘Where is your army?’ He bellowed. ‘It’s time for us to have a formal battle.’
‘What should we do?’ Sue whispered; her face was pale.
‘You both retreat; I’ll stay behind,’ Henry told her, and waved his green sword. Circles appeared in the air, accompanied by pleasant humming sounds.
‘We’re all retreating together,’ Liz said. Looking at Henry and Sue’s confused faces, she said firmly, ‘Trust me, I know what I’m doing.’ She raised her voice so the Vampire King could hear. ‘I don’t want to have a battle with you today; maybe another time.’ Liz turned her horse, and galloped away. Sue and Henry followed closely. 
Behind them, lightning cracked the dark sky, and rain poured down. 
28
Underground cave 

The black horse led the way, followed by the red and white horses; together they galloped across the red desert along the edge of the forest. They were riding so fast that it seemed the horses barely touched the ground; hills, farmlands and rocks zoomed into sight and zoomed away behind.  
‘Are they chasing us?’ Sue asked.
‘Yes, they are. These vampires can run fast,’ Henry reported, looking back through the heavy rain.
‘Do you think the vampires will go after the protesters?’
‘No, I don’t think so. The only worry in their king’s mind is Li Ping and her army. He won’t be interested in killing a few ordinary people right now.’
After another half hour of galloping, Henry said, ‘Liz, what do we do next? We’ll arrive at the sea soon.’
She signalled to Henry and Sue to stop; the horses raised their forelegs, kicked high in the air, and landed heavily on the ground. Liz pointed. ‘I saw the tornado disappear over there, it must be where the monsters’ nest is!’ 
They dismounted and ran to where the tornado had disappeared. They found themselves on the edge of a huge, deep cavity, making them feel as tiny as ants. A few gigantic trees grew out of the gash; they had to be at least three hundred feet tall. 
‘It’s the lake cave. The animal monsters must hide inside it.’ Liz remembered Terry saying the monsters hid deep underground.
‘Why have they stopped? What are they waiting for?’ Sue said, looking over her shoulder.
The vampire army had stopped about half a mile away, and were staring at them. Liz thought for a while. ‘I think the Vampire King suspects this could be a trap for him; or he may hope that we end up fighting with the monsters, so he can come and finish us off later.’
‘I can’t believe that we’ve ended up like this; with the Monster King waiting in front and Vampire King behind. So what’s your plan?’
‘Er…’ Liz hadn’t quite got around to formulating a plan; she had only planned as far as running this way. ‘Any suggestions?’
‘Why don’t we use an emergency help page from Li’s diary again? You just tear the blank page off, like this.’ He ripped the page out of the diary, read it, and frowned. ‘Water Margin Heroes?’
‘Isn’t that a classic Chinese novel?’ Sue said. 
‘I know that; don’t forget I told you about it. Can either of you figure out what we’re supposed to do?’ Henry said.
Liz thought, but nothing came to mind. ‘No idea. Now, please don’t argue but listen to me carefully.’ She told them how Terry had lost his whole unit in China, and Ronald’s unit had been withdrawn from Europe. 
‘Sue, it’ll get dark soon. You should be able to get away along the coast without vampires spotting you. It’s very important to tell Professor Brown about the monsters’ cave. Henry and I will rescue Fred. With any luck we can rescue him and kill a few monsters and backpack killers if they happen to be there.’
Sue thought for a moment. She said firmly, ‘Liz, I’m not going anywhere. I know that I’ve been scared and stuffed things up, and you worry that I’m not up to the mission. I can’t say I’m not afraid any more—I am—but I’m working on it. Please, Liz, give me one last chance, and I promise I’ll prove my worth. Remember, Fred is my brother.’
Liz gazed into Sue’s eyes for a few seconds, ‘OK, you can come with me, but promise you’ll listen to my commands.’
‘I promise I’ll do whatever you ask me.’
Henry seemed about to say something, but stopped; looking at the vampire army behind, and then the huge deep chamber in front, he said slowly, ‘Liz, I don’t know how to put this nicely. I know you love Fred, but this is not the right time and circumstance to show him your love…’
‘What are you talking about?’
‘It’s a suicide mission to rescue Fred, that’s what I’m talking about.’
Sue snapped, ‘A few minutes ago, you were willing to take on the whole vampire army by yourself and let Liz and me escape, but now you suddenly become a coward?’
‘Sue, the circumstances have changed. A few minutes ago, I had a reason to save you and Liz…’
‘Now we have to save Fred.’
Henry didn’t immediately respond; then he said. ‘We all like Fred in our own ways. Under normal circumstances, I wouldn’t think twice about going and rescuing him, even if it meant losing my own life; unfortunately, my own life, and yours, no longer belong to us anymore.’
‘What do you mean?’
‘Well, it seems that we’re the only ones, as far as we know, able to fight these monsters. I know there’s Professor Brown, but we don’t know if he’s are still alive or if he can get here. If we were killed today, the monsters could march into the city tomorrow. Is it the right thing to risk thousands of lives just to rescue a single individual, even if it’s Fred?’
Liz answered slowly. ‘Henry, you’re quite right, what you said, but there is also another aspect to this. The reason Terry organised the abduction and the vampires’ attack was to get Li Ping and her army out so he could destroy them all. Sure, we could escape and hide somewhere, but you know why the animal monsters and vampires haven’t attacked the city yet—they’re afraid of Li’s army. If there’s no rescue or counter-attack today, the evil monsters will be in Perth tomorrow. So even though we know it’s a trap, we still have to walk into it. But we can be smarter than that. I got some help from China.’
Taking out a handkerchief-sized parcel, she untied the knot, unfolded the silk wrapping, and chanted the Far Shu. Before Henry could ask a question, a layer of clothes appeared on him: a black Gong Fu-style top with a row of shiny gold buttons, loose black trousers, leather boots, black leather gloves, and a red cape over his shoulders. 
‘What magic clothes!’ Sue looked down at herself; she wore an identical outfit to Henry’s except that her cape was white, and Liz had a black cape. Sue stroked the material of her cape and flung it over one shoulder. Ever the fashion model, thought Liz, grinning inside.
‘They were the clothes of Jian Ke’s.’ She told Sue and Henry about their invisible magic properties. ‘Being invisible, we can go in unnoticed and seek an opportunity to rescue Fred. I promise you that we’ll sneak out if there’s no such chance.’ She paused, watching Henry’s expression, and then continued. 
‘One more point—while we’re inside the cave, the Vampire King won’t go and kill people, because he’ll want to find out what’s happening to us—so in that sense, we’re delaying the monsters’ attack on the city.’

It took them a while to climb down the thousands of zigzag wooden stairs attached to the deep chamber’s rocky cliff. At the entrance, Henry found a switch. ‘Don’t!’ said Liz too late: the dim cave lights flickered on.
Liz knew they were a hundred and seventy metres below the surface. Staring at a perfectly still lake, Liz felt she had just walked into fairyland: illuminated by the dim light, the water was like a magic mirror reflecting the millions of stalactites hanging from the cave’s ceiling. The wooden decking underfoot had one side against the rock wall, and the other resting on pillars inside the lake. They went single-file down the path, and reached a long bench. Liz suddenly remembered the special rock she had seen during their last visit. The tourist guide had told them that the reason she kept switching the lights off along the way was not only to create special light and colour effects, but more importantly to minimise the exposure of the special rocks inside the cave to the light. Holding a crystal rock the size of a football, she had put an electric torch against it. The solid rock was transparent, like a lantern. She had passed the rock around the group. It felt cold and wax-like, and quite light for its size. 
Was this the rock Terry was after? If it was, why had they started to mine at Wave Rock, two hundred fifty kilometres north of the Cave? Liz suddenly shivered: the only answer was that, deep underground, the whole south-east corner of Western Australia, from Wave Rock to the sea, was full of this rock; in other words, they were going to dig out a large chunk of Western Australia’s land mass.
Suddenly the lights turned itself off, and they were left in darkness.
‘Where should we go now?’ Sue’s voice interrupted Liz’s thoughts. 
‘I suggest that we start with this cave.’ Liz changed her mask from Li’s face to the Asian girl’s. ‘Let’s go’.
‘Should we get a torch?’ Sue whispered in the absolute darkness, unable to see her own fingers in front of her eyes.
‘We don’t want the monsters see us, do we? Liz, how do we make ourselves invisible?’ Henry asked.
‘Just wish that you’re invisible, and that the Jian Ke clothes will make us blend into the background.’
‘Let’s hope that’s true; in the darkness, nobody can verify it,’ said Henry.
‘Henry, please—trust me for once.’
They used their hands to fumble along the cave wall, walking blindly forwards. After ten minutes’, they approached some lights: on the caves’ ceiling, strings of glowing balls dangled only a foot above their heads.
‘They look so beautiful!’ Sue stretched out her hand.
‘Don’t.’ Henry gripped Sue’s wrist. ‘They’re not Christmas lights.’
‘Henry’s right—they look like glow-worm traps.’
‘You’ll be stuck to them if you touch them. Get down.’ Henry lowered himself, at the same time pulling Sue down; the glowing balls over their head suddenly dropped a few inches. 
On the ceiling, hundreds of bucket thick, foot-long worms appeared from nowhere, and strings with football-sized glowing balls dripped from their mouths and slipped downwards fast. Sue screamed. Looking in front of her and then behind, Liz saw light balls hanging all the way towards both ends of the cave. They were trapped. 
Henry pulled out his sword and swung it to slice a ball away, but the string stuck to the sword and started to withdraw upwards rapidly; more balls dropped towards him fast.
Twisting his sword, Henry sliced through the ball; like water, the glowing ball mended itself once the sword had passed through. Henry had to dive and roll to avoid another ball.
Liz and Sue were also on the ground, rolling fast backward and forward. Liz shouted, ‘Listen to me carefully, and do exactly as I say. Put your weapons away, and do the even number of the last thirteen circles of Tai Chi meditation, and then do the odd ones: start with Stopping Your Horse at the Edge of a Cliff, then Fish Leaping over the Dragon Gate; Phoenix Flying into Clouds, and then Dragon Diving into Deep Sea…’
Liz’s voice became softer and softer as dozens upon dozens of glowing balls fastened around her; soon she was covered with the sticky liquid. Her whole body was inside a huge gluey ball, like an insect trapped in amber. 
29
Platform 

Strong scents, the smells of animal fur, blood and other things she was unable to name, stroked Liz’s nostrils. Opening her eyes, she found she was tied to a wooden pole; layer upon layer of thick leathery rope wrapped her from shoulder to waist, but her legs were free. She struggled a bit; the ropes were too strong to be broken, and the wooden pole didn’t move at all.
Looking around, Liz saw Sue, Henry, Fred and other five people, including the minister, tied to other wooden poles: nine poles in a perfect line. Henry and Sue both looked at her and nodded. 
It was such a relief Henry and Sue were alive. When they had been engulfed by the giant glow-worm balls, Liz had known there was no way to escape, so she had taken a chance and guided Sue and Henry into the thirteenth level of Tortoise Hibernation so they wouldn’t be suffocated inside the gluey liquid. It was very risky; they might never have woken from the hibernation.
Now Liz felt her Qi increasing steadily, but she felt the evil energy inside her too. She guessed it was because she hadn’t meditated gradually into the highest level of Tortoise Hibernation. But there was no time to worry about that, so she turned her attention to the cave they were in. 
There was a flat area in the middle of a large cavity the size of a football field. It was illuminated by hundreds of abnormally bright flickering torches, some kind of magic, Liz assumed, around the rocky walls or floating in mid-air; the cave ceiling in the middle was so high it was lost in darkness. In front of the naturally-formed rocky platform where Liz was, a large crowd gathered and shouted, as if they were having some kind of celebration. Focusing more, Liz could see animal carcasses scattered around. That must be where the stink came from. A bear-headed, human-bodied monster stood on the edge of the platform and shouted to the crowd. 
Among the animal-headed monsters, there were some local animals from the area: dingos, kangaroos, wombats, lizards, tiger snakes, wedge-tailed eagles, cockatoos, crocodiles and many others; they looked ordinary, but they all spoke English. When her ear had become attuned to their animal accents, Liz realised out they were all shouting ‘Monster King’ to the bear-headed monster on the stage. 
With a loud roar, his body transformed completely into a huge brown bear. The Monster King waved his huge bear palms up and down to make the crowd quiet. ‘I have obtained reliable information that humans are going to attack my cave, our home. To be sure, I went out and investigated myself.’ He paused, and seemingly felt satisfied at not hearing a tiny noise. ‘There was a large assembly beside Wave Rock; the humans are having a war ceremony before launching an attack on us.’
‘How are they going to attack us?’ a white-haired chimpanzee-head monster asked. He must have held quite high rank, daring to interrupt the Monster King’s speech.
‘They will use some kind of machine to dig big holes in the ground until they reach our home. So we have attacked first, kidnapping the leaders. I’ll use them as our war ceremony sacrifices.’ The hall filled with animal bellowing, screaming and crying. A thick, deep roaring echoed through the cave. ‘Let’s have our sacrifices, and then—war with the humans!’
Nine bear-headed monsters strode up the platform; each, holding a shiny broadsword, stood in front of a pole. 
The monsters and animals became excited, pounding the ground with their feet, clapping their hands, banging their swords, or beating anything available to make a rhythm for their war dance. ‘Kill humans! Kill humans! Kill humans!’
The Monster King climbed onto a large boulder at one corner of the stage and raised his arm in the air. The crowd immediately became quiet. 
Liz knew that when the Monster King’s arm dropped, the bear monsters’ swords would land on their necks. She desperately tried to break the ropes around her body, but failed; her Qi had not fully recovered. Glancing at Fred, who was staring at the monsters in horror, Liz sighed. He would never know she was going to die trying to rescue him. She looked at Henry and Sue. Henry was glaring at the monster in front of him; Sue was shuddering with terror, her eyes squeezed shut. Liz wanted to say sorry. She had led them to their deaths because she was so confident that nobody would see them; she should have come by herself. 
Then she heard Henry shout, ‘Wait!’ 
His voice was loud, like thunder exploding in the air, and everyone turned and looked at him. Liz knew Henry had used a special Tai Chi, the Thunder Bolt. She felt relief: Henry’s Qi was fully recovered.
The Monster King signalled the bear monsters to put their swords down and walked towards Henry, halting in front of him. ‘Tell me why I should wait.’
‘My respected Monster King, could you please tell me why you want to kill us?’
‘I will tell you why, so you can die in peace—I knew you were going to attack my home—I was told by a very reliable source—so I struck first, taking these tribe leaders for my war sacrifice. I also am prepared to defend my home, and that’s how the three of you were captured…’
Henry interrupted him. ‘We’re not here to kill you—we just want to rescue our friend.’ He pointed at Fred. 
‘I won’t argue with you: humans have very strange logic. I learnt that a thousand years ago. You are going to die: that’s my final decision.’ The Monster King walked back to the rock he had stood on earlier.
‘Monster King!’ Henry shouted. ‘Please kill me first. I can’t bear to watch you kill girls in front of me. We humans normally don’t kill women and children.’
‘But you humans kill girl animals and baby animals! However, because you all will die soon, I’ll kindly grant your wish.’ He got back on his boulder, ‘As he wishes—kill him.’ The Monster King pointed at Henry.
The bear monster raised his sword high, and chopped at Henry’s neck with all his might. 
Stretching his neck as far as possible towards the fast approaching sword, as the sword almost touched his skin, Henry drew his head back, opened his mouth, and bit the sword; his right foot kicked at the bear monster with enormous force, sending him high in the air, off the platform. 
Even before the bear monster had hit the ground, Henry spat out the sword and made a sweeping kick as it fell. 
It shot at Liz. 
Liz was prepared. The sword whistled past her, slicing off a strand of the rope around her. That was enough for her: she directed a stream of Qi into her arms and exploded outward. With loud pops like firecrackers, the ropes burst into hundreds of tiny pieces. Even before getting her hands free, Liz caught the passing sword with her foot and shot it back at Henry. While the bear monster in front of her was still trying to figure out what had happened, she kicked him off the platform. 
Leaping towards Sue, Liz gripped the sword of the monster before he could react, twisting her body so her shoulder hit the monster’s chest; he was knocked off the platform. She used his sword to slice through Sue’s ropes, like cutting into soft cheese. 
Sue was free.
Meanwhile, Henry’s foot caught the flying sword, kicking it gently upwards; it changed course, and sliced through the ropes around his chest. He picked up the falling sword, took two giant leaps, and landed on the rock beside the Monster King. 
As the monster’s powerful paw with its razor-sharp claws swiped at him, he gripped the Monster King’s thick hairy wrist with his left hand and kicked at his legs; the huge monster fell on his bottom. Even sitting, the monster was a head taller than Henry; however, Henry twisted the bear’s arm behind his back, and pushed the sword deep against the thick fur on the throat.
The whole sequence was so fast that in no more than two seconds the sword that was supposed to chop Henry’s head off was threatening the Monster King’s life instead. 
The crowd gasped.
The remaining six bear monsters held their swords to the throats of the people still tied to the poles, including Fred.
‘Release Monster King,’ shouted the chimpanzee monster. 
‘Get all these bear monsters off the platform; otherwise, I swear I will kill your King,’ Henry shouted back, and his sword pressed against the Monster King’s throat even tighter.
‘Kill me or not, you won’t be able to get out of here alive,’ the Monster King roared, ‘Kill all the humans, and prepare for war. My son will be the new Monster King.’ 
And the great bear shape suddenly jerked his head forward. 
The crowd groaned in horror, and expected to see blood gush from the Monster King’s throat; however, their noise died slowly as neither blood nor sliced throat could be seen. Henry, sensing the pressure against his sword, had withdrawn his arm accordingly. The King twisted and contorted his huge body using his enormous strength, but was unable to get free of Henry’s Tai Chi grip.
‘Take it easy, Monster King,’ the chimpanzee monster shouted. He turned to the six bear monsters. ‘You—all get off the platform, now!’ He waited until they had left. ‘I’ve done as requested. Now it’s your turn to release Monster King.’
‘Not until I get a guarantee we can leave safely,’ Henry replied.
‘Humans can’t be trusted. I order you to kill them all!’ The Monster King roared again, but his struggle against Henry’s grip was in vain. Henry’s sword was still at his throat.
‘Monster King, I told you that we are not here to kill you, but to rescue our friend. How can we convince you we are not your enemy?’ asked Liz.
‘Release our king—it would prove you are not our enemy,’ shouted the chimpanzee monster from below. 
‘If I release your Monster King, will you let us leave safely?’ Henry said.
‘Yes, anything you want, as long as you release him.’
‘Can we trust their word?’ Sue whispered.
‘We don’t have much choice,’ Liz answered quietly, and raised her voice. ‘Please let the respected Monster King go.’
Henry stared at Liz for a second, and nodded. Without a sign of making any move, he floated backwards off the boulder and landed beside Liz and Sue.
The split second he was free, the Monster King leapt off the rock; his huge body dropped thirty feet, landing on the ground with a heavy thud. 
The chimpanzee monster raised his arm in the air. ‘Kill them all!’
Hundreds of animal monsters carrying weapons started climbing the platform.

Life and Death Bets

‘Stop!’ the Monster King roared.
The monsters stopped, looking back at the Monster King and then at his chimpanzee adviser.
‘You are not seriously thinking of letting them go, are you?’ the chimpanzee monster said.
‘Never!’ His huge palm smacked a rock the size of a desk, which exploded. ‘I have never had such humiliation in my entire life! I will tear them all into pieces with my own hands!’
Seeing the hundreds of monsters surrounding the platform, Liz knew it would be impossible to get out alive; she needed to work something out quickly. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if she could understand Li’s emergency help message? Water Margin Heroes. What could it mean?
Like lightning cracking the black sky of her mind, Liz suddenly understood. ‘Water Margin heroes! Of course, it has to be Water Margin Heroes. How could I not understand Li’s message? Water Margin is about a group of bandits who lived in a marshland. They formed a brotherhood and fought against the corrupt court. Each of them had their own reasons for joining the gang. Only those who were skilled in hand-to-hand combat and martial arts were qualified to become members.’ 
From her brief encounter with the Monster King, Li must have sensed that it was possible to persuade the Monster King and his followers to be friends —or at least not to fight.
Liz snapped her eyes to Henry and spoke in his head. His eyes brightened and he bowed to the bear. ‘Monster King, it was pure luck I defeated you—you were unprepared, so it should not really count. I suggest that we have some formal challenges, and that would be fair to everyone.’ 
‘Of course I was unprepared,’ the Monster King roared. ‘This time I will tear you to pieces, or smash you into a meat pie.’ He started walking towards the rocky steps.
‘Monster King, can I have a word with you please,’ the chimpanzee said something in the Monster King’s ear. It seemed the king didn’t agree with the suggestion initially; he shook his head and argued, and the chimpanzee spoke some more. After a few more rounds of argument, the Monster King reluctantly nodded. He spoke loudly, ‘As you admit yourself, you were purely lucky to defeat me, and I should kill you all for that; however, I do respect those who have courage and with genuine skill, so I’ll give you each a chance to prove yourselves.’
He paused, looking around at his monster fellows, and continued. ‘There will be three life-and-death tests, one for each of you. If you are beaten or injured, you all will be killed—understand?’
‘What happens if we win?’ Henry asked.
‘That’s impossible; nevertheless, if by some miracle you win all tests, I’ll let you free—all of you. But you don’t stand a chance. Now, let’s get some entertainment value out of you before you die.’
‘Where do we have these life-and-death tests?’ Liz asked.
‘On the platform, of course, so everyone can see.’ 
He led the way onto the platform, followed by the chimpanzee and the six bears with broadswords. On the way up, he accepted a war axe from another monster, tucking it under his belt. When he stood on the rock surrounding by his six bear monsters, the Monster King pointed at Sue. ‘You first.’
Sue’s legs were shaking. She felt ashamed about her fear but couldn’t help it. Looking at Liz and Henry’s concerned expressions, at the thousands of noisy monsters and Fred at other side of the platform, Sue knew she had no choice but to fight.
She saw the Monster King use his hand to draw a circle in the air over the platform. When he finished, a large white circle, six metres across, appeared on the dark rocky platform; at the same time, the nine wooden poles, some with people still tied to them, moved towards the back. So the Monster King had a few tricks. He was proud of himself; Sue could tell from his expression. Somehow, she felt much less scared about someone who behaved in such a childish way.
The Monster King looked down at his crowd. The monsters surrounding him shouted, showing their willingness to fight, but the Monster King shook his huge head. He signalled a tall woman behind the crowd to come forward.
Sue let out a deep breath—at least she was going to fight a human, not those scary animal-head monsters.
The Monster King called for silence. ‘You, the White Cape woman…’
Liz spoke. ‘Sorry to interrupt you, but I’d like to introduce ourselves. We are Jian Ke.’
‘JK, what kind of animal is that? I’ve never heard of it.’
‘Jian Ke is not the name of animal, but our title. It means Sword Guests. I’m the Black Cape Jian Ke, she is the White Cape Jian Ke, and he is ...’
‘I know—he is the Red Cape JK,’ the Monster King interrupted.
‘You are clever to work that out.’
The Monster King laughed happily. ‘Well, it’s quite simple and logical. OK, you, the White Cape JK—pardon me for calling you JK; it’s easier for me—you fight with Spider Monster. If you are blown, kicked, or smashed outside of the circle first, you lose the bet and you all will be killed.’
Spider monster? Sue wondered if she understood the Monster King correctly. Maybe his English wasn’t so good and he used the wrong word. The tall, dark-skinned, beautiful woman was no spider. 
Soon she realised how wrong she was.
The woman stood on the other side of the circle and let out a laugh. As her voice trailed off, two legs stuck out from each side of her ribs. They were huge and hairy. Then the spider monster’s human arms and legs started to transform into spider legs. The worst part was her head; Sue felt sick watching the huge hairy spider head grow. She had been so scared about a tiny spider in their picnic a few days ago—that was nothing compared what in front of her now. Sue smiled bitterly.
Her head spinning, Sue heard the Monster King say, ‘Good luck, white JK—she just ate her husband not long ago so she is full of energy.’ She saw him chop his hand down as he bellowed, ‘Start! No magic is allowed!’ He added another rule.
The circle was not very big after all. Once the spider stretched all of her eight long legs, she covered half the space. Sue backed away.
Without warning, the giant spider leapt into the air and flew at Sue like a blacklegged rain cloud. Sue did the only thing she could, dashing sidewards out of the spider’s way. Her body made a curve in the air, and landed just inside of the circle. 
Henry shouted, ‘Well done!’
Sue knew it was not that well done, because her leg was scratched. Imagining the spider’s hairy leg touching her skin, Sue felt revulsion. She clenched her teeth, forcing herself to swallow the bile that rose in her throat. She could not afford to show she was afraid.
Liz shouted, ‘Qi! Use your Qi.’
Of course—she needed to use her Qi. Sue remembered in the Long Dream she had chopped a thick tree branch with her bare palm, and her hand hadn’t even got dirty. Could she use her Qi now? As soon as she concentrated on her Qi, Sue felt a warm current flood her body fast, almost violently. She directed her Qi into her palm, and looked at the spider, only metres away. Her opponent hadn’t turned around, but moved all eight legs backward at Sue, trying to swipe her out of the circle. Sue focused on the legs, her left hand protecting her upper body; her right palm formed a palm knife and chopped at the upper section of the closest spider leg. Sue didn’t want to chop the spider’s leg off—just force her out of the circle; so she put a spin in her force.
The spider went spinning into the air, and dropped to the ground. As speedy as an arrow, Sue shot down and landed beside the spider at the exact moment her body crashed to the ground. She then jumped back up, light as a feather, landing on the platform gently. Raising her left hand to form a sword finger, she saluted the Monster King. 
‘We both lost the bet, Sir. I suggest that we make it a draw—do you agree?’
The Monster King automatically saluted back. ‘I appreciate your kindness in offering the deal, White Cape JK. But I still have to punish Spider Monster because she didn’t win—unless you want to take her?’
Spider Monster got on her feet, changed back to a woman, and begged the White Cape Jian Ke to take her as her slave.
‘This is the only way you can save her life—by being her master. This is our rule,’ the Monster King explained.
‘We don’t have slaves in our world. So OK, I will be your master. You are forgiven for your failure. My respected Monster King, could she still stay with you?’ 
‘Of course, I’ll look after her for you. She won’t be treated as one of mine from now on.’ He talked quietly with the chimpanzee for a few minutes. ‘Let’s not waste time; the second bet: you, Black Cape JK, have to fight with two of my soldiers. No circle this time. You have to knock both of them off the stage to win. One more rule: weapons and magic are not permitted.’ 
The Monster King ordered two crocodile-head monsters to the platform.
31
Horseback

Waddling along with their long heavy tails swinging behind, the crocodile-head monsters looked quite funny. Apart from their heads and tails, the rest of their bodies were human bodies. Liz was actually a bit taller than them, but they were much rounder, like thick tree stumps. Looking at their sharp teeth, Liz guessed why the Monster King decided to make her fight the crocs; her injured ankle hurt, and she expected that he had enough power to sense she had something wrong with her leg; it wouldn’t be easy to deal with two large crocodiles. But life was not supposed to be easy. Liz shook her head and gave a Jian Ke salute to the crocodiles. 
When they tried to salute back the same way, their short front arms made the action quite difficult, particularly putting their not-often-used fingers into the right position. The crocodile on the left spent almost two minutes to get his index finger and middle finger straight, but was unable to hold back the other fingers. Impatiently, the Monster King asked him to stop.
Almost laughing aloud, Liz felt she sort of liked them. ‘What are your names? My name is Black Cape Jian Ke. I’d like to know yours before we fight. If one of us is going to be hurt or killed, we should know who did it.’ 
‘We don’t have proper names. We are just called C1 and C2,’ the crocodile on Liz’s left answered.
‘So who is C1 and who is C2, then?’
‘I’m C1 and he is C2.’
‘How can I tell? You look exactly the same to me.’
‘Well, my tail is half inch longer than his, and I always stand on his left. So you know it is C1 if he stands on your left.’
‘My mouth is an inch longer than yours, and you are wrong about standing on her left. If you always stand on my left, you would be on her right, you stupid crocodile,’ C2 argued.
Liz was amused. ‘OK, I’ll try to remember what you look like. Are you ready to fight?’
The two crocodiles slowly positioned themselves so the three of them formed a perfect triangle. The Monster King shouted, ‘Start!’
His voice died in the air, but no one moved. 
C1 and C2 stood very still, staring at Liz. Their back legs were apart, and their front arms held back; they looked like two pieces of dead wood sticking out of the ground. But they were more like compressed springs, Liz knew; their muscles stored powerful energy that would explode at unbelievable attacking speed. 
There was no sound from the audience; Liz could have heard a needle fall. The tension in the air was too heavy to breathe. Then it happened. 
No one saw how C1 and C2 sprang up—they only saw two blurs shooting at Liz. 
Liz put pressure on her uninjured foot and jumped in the air. One foot stepping on C1’s upper jaw, she somersaulted and landed behind him. Her injured foot sent a spasm of pain to her brain. Liz felt a black shadow cover her eyes momentarily. 
After heavily landing on the ground, C1 and C2 spun around. Nobody would have believed they were so slow a few seconds ago. They repositioned themselves, one in front of Liz and the other behind; with no warning, they launched their second attack. 
Their teeth were within biting distance of Liz’s skin. They were attacking her at different levels: C1 attacked her upper body, while C2 went for her legs. It seemed that there was neither time nor room for Liz to avoid the attack, but Liz was faster. Jumping in the air, within a split second she used her right hand to push against the upper jaw of C1 and her left foot to kick C2’s bottom jaw; by doing that, she effectively aligned the two crocodiles at the same height. 
C1 and C2 crashed into each other in front of her. There were two heavy thuds as they landed on the ground unconscious. 
Sue made a Jian Ke salute to the Monster King, and said nobody won the game because nobody was off the platform.
Looked disappointed, the Monster King ordered C1 and C2, who were staggering to their feet, to beg Liz to take them as her slaves if they wanted to live. Liz didn’t say anything but accepted their appeal. 
After another consultation with the chimpanzee, the Monster King pointed at five of the bear monsters beside him and told Henry the rules of the game had changed again; they were not going to do the competition on stage any more, but instead, Henry would have to fight the five monsters on horseback. 
‘You win by knocking all of them off their horses. If a girl can deal with two of my fastest warriors, you should be able to fight five of my best horseback soldiers. If you can’t, you will die.’
‘I’ll take your challenge, but I also have two conditions.’ 
The Monster King looked surprised, and asked what Henry’s conditions were.
‘The first is that I don’t want you to punish these bear monsters, if by chance they lose the test; I don’t want to take any slaves.’ 
The Monster King said that he was more than happy to accept the first condition.
‘The second is that you release all of these people, regardless of who wins the last test. If they lose, your five bear warriors and you have to do me a favour in the future, whenever I want.’
The Monster King thought for a while, and said, ‘I accept your second condition as well. Can we offer you a horse?’
‘No, thanks, I have my own.’
At a long whistle, five horses fully equipped with saddles and lances trotted from one of the many side caves, and the five bear monsters mounted with a few clanks. They were ready. Five tall, strong bears, all in armour and helmets, on huge horses definitely represented a deadly threat. 
Henry took out his paper horse, tossing it in the air; it glided down in front of the platform. As soon as the paper horse touched the ground, Bang!—up jumped a shiny chestnut horse trotting happily in front of the platform. 
Nobody in the crowd had ever seen such a handsome horse; some of the monsters whistled and shouted to show their admiration. The Monster King waved his arm to silence the crowd. 
Leaping off the edge of the platform and making a series of somersaults in the air, Henry landed lightly in the saddle. He rode towards the centre of the cave; with one swift arm movement, a green sword was in his hand; his action was so fast that most of his audience didn’t see where he got his weapon from. 
‘Are you going to use your sword against their lances?’ the Monster King asked.
‘Yes, I am.’
The five armoured bear warriors sat still on their horses, forming a half-circle in front of Henry. The distance between them was a mere thirty metres; it would not take long for the horses to cover it. 
Every pair of eyes was staring at the Monster King’s arm. 
He chopped his hand in the air.
‘Start!’ 
Instantly, five bear monsters charged at Henry. Five long sharp lances aimed at his chest. Five galloping horses’ iron hoofs pounded on the rocky ground, leaving traces of five lines of dust behind in the echoing underground cave. 
At the exact moment the Monster King’s arm came down, Henry launched his own attack, charging straight towards the centre of the oncoming formation. 
The distance between Henry and his five opponents shrank fast: twenty-five metres, twenty metres, fifteen metres—when suddenly Henry’s horse turned sharply left and Henry lay back, flat against his horse’s back. The monsters’ lances passed just above his eyes with a noise of tearing air. Using the flat of his sword, Henry swiped one bear off his horse.
Past the wing of the monsters’ formation, Henry kept going for twenty metres, while the remaining four warriors turned their horses and faced him again.
The leader of the warriors gave orders; two horses trotted to get behind Henry, and one moved to his left, they were going to attack him from all four directions. With a roar, the riders on the four horses charged.
While the bears’ bellows still echoed in the air, Henry charged forwards; his sword touched the front bear’s lance, drew a half circle under it, and the bear was pulled out of his saddle in a perfect curve, landing on the ground with a thud. 
Three other lances were right behind him, one aimed directly at his back and one on each side. Switching his sword from his right to his left hand and swinging it backwards, Henry drew a beautiful curve that bounced the two lances, while his upper body twisted leftwards sharply. 
The tip of the last lance slipped past his rib, just under his armpit. He clenched his arm down in time to catch the last bear huge body. The sequence was so fast that everyone except Liz, Sue and the Monster King only saw two monsters flying sidewards off their horses and a last one dashing right under Henry’s arm. 
Galloping to the platform, Henry released the bear and saluted. ‘Sir, I hope I haven’t hurt your warriors.’ 
‘I have never seen anybody with the skill to beat five of my best bear warriors in my entire life!’ the Monster King roared.
The last bear monster caught by Henry stood up. He didn’t look sad, angry or disappointed; on the contrary, he seemed quite delighted. ‘It is my pleasure to be beaten by you, Sir. I’ll do any favour for you as you wish. I have really enjoyed the experience,’ he roared happily.
The Monster King beamed. ‘This is my only son, Brince. I thank you for your kindness in not hurting him. I respect people with real skill, the skill of using their hands and their weapons, not the ones with spells—that’s rubbish. As promised, you can ask me to do you a favour whatever and whenever it may be. But remember there will be only one favour.’
Henry’s horse trotted in a circle sniffing loudly. Henry pointed at Fred and the other people. ‘What about these people?’
‘I always keep my word. Please feel free to take them with you,’ the Monster King said. 
Liz twisted her wrist, and her whip made hundreds of loops and curves. When it turned back to a pen again, everyone was free from the poles; her whip had cut all ropes clean away.
‘You all are very good, I’m very impressed indeed. I saw such fighting skill only a few days ago. I wonder if you are related to the black-haired woman.’
‘She is our grand master. My respected Monster King, you mentioned you were informed about the oncoming attack. Dare I ask who this informer was?’
‘A single-handed vampire, this morning, while escaping from the attackers. The poor fellow lost one of his hands, and almost his life. I really appreciated his helping me avoid an unexpected attack.’
‘Where is this vampire now?’
‘He left to report to the Vampire King. Tell me: are you part of the attackers?’
‘No, we are definitely not. As we said before, we came here to rescue our friend.’ Liz gave a Jian Ke salute to the king. ‘My respected Monster King, we won’t be your enemy after you release these people, and I hope that we might become friends one day.’ 
‘Of course; we can be friends right now.’ The Monster King ignored his adviser’s gestures. ‘Kill a few deer, kangaroos, sheep and cows. Let’s have a feast to celebrate.’ 
‘I don’t think so!’
Everyone looked back; the voice came from one of the tunnels opposite the platform. As the voice died away, the Vampire King walked into the vast chamber, followed by his thousand-soldier strong vampire army. 
32
Formations

Silently, the animal monsters drew around the platform where the Monster King stood. The Vampire King’s marching army echoed in the huge hollow space. It seemed to take forever for all his soldiers to walk out of the tunnel. Finally it became silent again. Across vacant middle ground, the Monster King’s and the Vampire King’s armies stared at each other, like two groups of ancient statues.
Liz knew the Monster King and the Vampire King were busily calculating what their best options were; her own best option was to turn the Monster King against the Vampire King, or at least not against her. ‘We have a done-deal, my respected Monster King. I also believe you are in charge in your own home.’ Via her Qi, Liz made her voice loud enough for the Vampire King to hear from a couple of hundred metres away. 
The Monster King did not respond immediately, but after his adviser whispered something in his ear, he nodded. ‘Yes, my dear JK guests, I always keep my word. We have a deal indeed; you can take these people away any time you like. I’m the one in charge in my own home. I don’t take orders from others.’
‘Old Bear Monster, do you really think you can disobey me and get away with it? Even though I call you a king, you are nothing, absolutely nothing to me.’ His eyes scanning the animal monsters around the Monster King, the Vampire King raised his voice. ‘Hear me, you monsters. Your leader, Bear Monster, disobeyed me, and he will be punished severely, but you don’t have to be punished with him. Join me and you’ll be pardoned, or at least you can go away and be free. Make up your minds quickly. You don’t have much time to waste.’
Hubbub arose among the animal monsters. A few clusters started to move away from the Monster King and disappear down the nearby tunnels. Liz noticed they were mainly insects and similar creatures, spiders, caterpillars, mantises, and the like. However, some animal monsters who stayed looked worried.
The Monster King said nothing.
Liz knew the longer they waited, the more dangerous the situation would become. Although the Monster King had lost about half the monsters who had escaped with him from Wave Rock, the rest were too scared to openly go against the Vampire King. She suspected that they might also want to see how she was going to deal with the Vampire King, to assess if she was a worthwhile ally or not.
Leaving was not an option for the humans. Even if Liz and her friends chose to run from the Vampire King, they would not be able to find their way out—how could they pass the glow-worm trap? Therefore, the choice was clear—they had to fight the Vampire King and his thousand-strong army.
While thousands of different thoughts bounced inside her head, Liz was well aware that everyone was staring at her: Sue, Henry, Fred, thousands of pairs of eyes, all waited for her response. She had to do or say something. Liz gathered her thoughts and cried in a loud voice, ‘Vampire King, we are Jian Ke, and our duties are protect the innocent against evil like you. I suggest that we fight outside in the open space to avoid hurting others, what do you say?’
The Vampire King stared at Henry’s sword. ‘You’re the Chinese lady’s friends. Do you think that I’m stupid enough to go outside so your Chinese lady friend can ambush me…’
Liz suddenly felt a surge of hot current start from her injured ankle and throb upwards. She thought it was her Qi at first, but soon realised the evil energy had activated again; but this felt completely different from her previous experience, almost as if the evil energy was being controlled by an external force.
As soon as the idea burst into her mind, Liz glanced at the Vampire King again. It confirmed her suspicions. The Vampire King twisted his long, bony fingers as if he was gripping an invisible object in mid-air. With each twist, Liz felt the evil energy push up more. The Vampire King was going to force the energy to her head and take control of her.
She clenched her teeth and tried to use her own Qi to counterattack, to suppress the evil energy downwards. As the invisible struggle took place, Liz knew both her own Qi and the evil energy were boosted tremendously. Her body was reaching boiling point and was going to explode.
‘Goodbye, Sue, Henry and Fred.’ Her eyes moistened; she used all her self-control to stop the threatening tears so she could use the self-destruct measure to activate the paper cut soldiers before it was too late. Without her the magic soldiers wouldn’t be able to fight in formation, but at least they should cause some damage to the vampire army, and Henry and Sue might have the chance to escape.
Taking out the box of soldiers, Liz pulled her hair band out; her silky black hair spread over her shoulders like a waterfall. Putting the tip of her tongue between her teeth and biting hard, she felt pain and tasted salt. 
As white smoke rose from the top of her head, Liz felt the mixture of her Qi and the evil energy, now magnified a hundredfold by the self-destruct Far Shu, surge upwards. They would explode out of her head like a volcano. 
Volcano! Where had she heard that recently? 
—Her father, just this morning. While holding the box with one hand and tapping his head with the other, he had said, ‘Sometimes my headaches are so bad that they feel like volcano explosions and I wish I could drop a Taishan Mountain on top of my head…’
Thought struck fast as lightning. ‘Taishan Mountain Crushing Down’ was one of the most powerful and deadly Tai Chi methods of attacking an enemy. A fighter accumulated most of his Qi into his palm and smashed it on top of his enemy’s head, like Taishan Mountain crashing down. 
Opening her mouth and spraying a red fog of blood in the air, Liz held the box with her left hand, smashed her right palm on top of her head, and shouted. 
‘Ji!’
The energy from her right palm collided with the force exploding out of her head. The two streams united, changed direction, and burst from the only exit, her left palm. A bright arc shot from her hand, blowing the box high in the air. It twisted and opened, and a stream of paper cut people flew through the air like large snowflakes. They rained on the rocky ground in front of the platform, and Bang!—a beam of thick smoke burst into the air. As the smoke gradually disappeared, a square formation, nineteen rows by nineteen columns, three hundred and sixty one soldiers, appeared from nowhere. 
Liz blinked her eyes and took a deep breath. She was still alive. 
Now the energy had burst out of her, she felt great relief. Even better, it seemed that there was not enough evil energy left within her to enable the Vampire King to control her any more. Smiling happily, she turned to organise her magic soldiers into a military formation 
But as she tried to move, she felt suddenly frozen. She could not move her legs; from the knee downwards she was paralysed. She looked at her legs, willing them to work. In the back of her head, dimly, she heard the Vampire King begin the command for attack. There was no time to work out why and how her paralysis had happened.
Liz spoke calmly to Sue and asked her to get ready to battle. Nodding, Sue took out her paper horse, throwing it in the air; it glided to a stop below the platform and instantly a handsome white horse popped up. She leapt from the edge of the platform, somersaulting in the air, and landed on her Snowflake like a fallen leaf. Several of the monsters cheered and applauded, particularly the spider monster.
Sue rode forward, stopping beside Henry’s Fireball. As she waved her arm upwards, her golden bangle slipped off her wrist, spinning above her head. It grew larger and larger, spinning faster and faster. After a series of beautiful interwoven circles, it glided back to her hand. The bangle had transformed into a three-foot-wide golden ring, its rim sparkling.
Liz looked back at the Vampire King, just in time to see him wave his arm forward and order his men to attack. Equipped with lances, spears, war axes and other, strange-looking weapons, the soldiers made terrifying roars as they marched forward, like black sea waves.
Liz jerked her arm. The long dragon-whisker whip shot out, making hundreds of interweaving circles in the air. From nowhere, a black horse leapt out. Liz flicked her whip, wrapped it around the saddle, and pulled; she flew through mid-air and mounted Ink-Dust. Then, like a rainy cloud, the black horse and his rider galloped over the edge of the platform, glided, and landed gently on the ground. 
The two Crocodile Monsters cheered loudly. 
Her dragon whisker whip cracked; her soldiers started to spread outwards. Each took out a flag, waving it overhead. Different parts of the formation had different coloured flags; hundreds of flags flapped at the same time, a sea of waving colours.
There was another crack from her whip. The flags started waving in different motions, up and down, sideways, or circling, and gradually, different coloured fogs started to form over the square of soldiers. 
The first row of the vampire army was only metres away.
‘Henry, you stay where the green fog is. Kill anyone who gets close to you, but don’t chase them if they retreat. Sue, you stay with the yellow fog, and do the same. Please do exactly as I have said.’
Liz rode towards the rainbow-coloured fog in the centre. As the sea of black vampires poured into the formation, her whip made one last crack, and the different fogs started spinning faster and faster. The formation was in full operation.

Seated on Fireball, Henry watched in amazement: spiral green fog emerged from the ground, shot high into the air, and expanded overhead. Soon a group of vampires stumbled out of the thick curtain of green, seemingly confused where they were heading until they saw Henry only a few metres away. 
Charging forwards, Henry’s green sword made a deadly net over their heads; they screamed, running away. 
Henry didn’t pursue, as Liz requested. 

In the yellow foggy background, the group of black-clothed vampires stood out clearly. As she was about to cast her Yin Yang Rings, Sue saw a few yellow-armoured soldiers appear from the fog, as if they had materialised from the thick yellow cloud. 
While the magic soldiers’ swords and spears attacked the vampires from above, Sue’s Yang Ring made a pretty golden curve in the air, cutting a vampire in half; before the ring glided back to her hand, she threw out her silver Yin Ring; another vampire became headless.
The rest of the vampires let out a panicked cry, disappearing into the fog.

Seated on her horse and waiting, Liz heard desperate screaming as the vampires were killed by the magic soldiers. She had defeated five groups of vampires and killed dozens of them. Suddenly, she heard a crack; all the fog around her disappeared instantly.
A few hundred metres away, a dozen vampires stood in a row, each carrying a backpack. They raised torch-like weapons and sprayed a shower of red sparks at Liz and her magic army. Lying flat on her horse, Liz missed the red spark by half a centimetre. Three sparks hit her horse; it immediately shrank to a tiny paper horse with three burning holes in it. 
Rolling over, from the corner of her eye she caught Henry stabbing his sword into a vampire’s chest, and shielding himself from a cluster of red sparks behind the dead body. For a moment, Liz was puzzled that the dead vampire’s body didn’t decay instantly, but she hadn’t time to think about it just now. Her soldiers were turning back to burning paper cut figures. There was the hollow boom of a seashell blowing, and the remaining vampires stampeded forward and surrounded Liz.

Flying Rings

Henry swung his sword, deflected a heavy blow from a war axe, and sliced the vampire’s head off. Blood shot in the air. Henry turned quickly and, just in time, leapt forward and buried his sword into a vampire’s chest while the vampire’s broadsword was still raised high.
	Through gaps between vampire bodies and weapons, he tried to locate Liz and Sue. He fought his way towards Liz. He couldn’t remember how many vampires he had slaughtered. His face was covered with sweat and blood. It was a hopeless battle, as vampires swooped on him—like stepping on an ant nest, he just killed one batch of them and another batch filled their place.
His sword grew heavier and heavier. He knew it would only be a matter of time before he was killed, but he wouldn’t give up while he was still able to wield his sword. As he grabbed one vampire and swung him in front of him as a shield, he heard a loud roar.
‘Charge!’
There was no mistaking the voice of the Monster King. Henry watched the vampires around him move away, following a long seashell blast.
Although he had expected—or rather, hoped—that the Monster King and his army would join them against the Vampire King, Henry couldn’t believe it when it actually happened. Henry threw the dead vampire away, jumped on a high rock, and his eyes opened wide.
The Monster King, on his warhorse, raised his war axe and charged towards the vampire army. Behind him, a fully armoured bear cavalry followed. As well as the horseback bears, a team of rhinos were an unstoppable force. A group of crocodiles, led by C1 and C2, dashed at the enemy, and vampires were cut in half by their large scissor jaws. Siberian tigers charged with earth-shaking roars. Behind the tigers rushed a gorilla army, lions and wolves. Far to the left, vampires were being thrown against the walls by two giant pythons. 
Beneath the vampires’ feet, vines and plants suddenly leapt out of ground, wrapping their legs and dragging them into sharp thorns. Huge flowers on the vines opened and engulfed them. A group of red kangaroos jumped high, crushing the heads of the enemy; when they landed, they stood on their tails, their two strong back legs kicking, sending vampires flying backward. 
Hundreds of vampire bats took off like dark clouds, with shrill, high shrieks. 
The Monster King raised his war axe; his eagle squad launched, clashing head to head with the vampire bats. Feathers, blood, and bodies of eagles and bats dropped over the battleground.
The battlefield was filled with metal clashing, screaming, roaring, and whistling. The air smelled of blood, and the stink of vampire corpses. Rapidly, the black sea of vampires was diluted into different colours.
Suddenly feeling a surge of strength inside his body, Henry leapt off the rock, rushing towards the noisy battling clots not far away. 

With one arm to support her in a sitting position, Liz’s other arm waved her whip forming a protective net around her; the whistling whip bounced away arrows and daggers shooting at her and kept her enemies out of range.
It consumed an enormous amount of her energy to be constantly waving and twisting her long whip without a moment’s break. Her Qi and the evil energy inside her body collided and circled along her energy-channels; clearly, the evil energy had grown back rapidly. 
Liz felt numbness creep past her knees. She didn’t know how long it would be before her whole body became paralysed. Sweat blurred her sight. Her last drop of power had been used up.
She heard the seashell blowing. All the vampires surrounding her moved away except two. They were both huge, with broad shoulders. They had sensed Liz’s exhaustion and smelled her blood. The first one used his spear to touch Liz’s whip on the ground. There was no response; dropping his spear and taking out his dagger, he sneered, pushed the second vampire back and stepped forward. His hand grasped Liz’s hair.
Liz moved her head fast, and dragged his arm side-downwards. He lost his balance and his huge body crashed in front of her. She shrank her whip back to a pen, and stabbed into his eye, and the tip of the pen stuck out from the back of the vampire’s head.
The remaining vampire howled and stabbed at Liz with his long spear, but a sword chopped his arm off. From behind, Henry’s face appeared.
‘Liz, what happened to you?’
‘I’m afraid both my legs are paralysed, and my whole body will follow soon.’
‘Hold on to me tight.’ Henry put his arm around Liz’s hip and lifted her against him. She held Henry’s shoulder. 
‘Have you seen Sue?’ 
‘No. I’ll get you to a safe place and then find Sue.’ Henry took a deep breath, lifted his Qi, and carried Liz towards the rock wall at the chamber’s edge.
Clusters of escapers and their chasers went by. Sometimes it was animal monsters chasing the vampires and sometimes the other way around. Once or twice Henry and Liz became entangled in these small battling groups. Then vampire weapons were thrown into the air as soon as they touched Henry’s sword, as if there were a tornado around it; the weapons were followed by limbs or heads. Finally, Henry reached a tunnel opening off the cave. He stepped inside before anybody could see them. 
The magic lights of the main cave illuminated the tunnel quite brightly. Liz looked about. It wasn’t a tunnel at all—it was a dead end. They could see the rocky wall at the far end of the chamber, merely twenty metres away.
They both sighed, but said nothing. Henry straightened his shoulders. ‘Liz, you should be all right here for the moment. I’m going to go out and look for Sue, and I’ll be back to check on you soon.’ He dashed out.
After Henry disappeared, Liz tried to do the Tortoise Hibernation so she could reduce the evil energy on its way to dominate her whole body. The screaming, explosive sounds and various battle noises distracted her; when Henry rushed in again, she was nowhere near any state of meditation.
‘Have you found Sue?’
‘Not yet, just came back to make sure you’re all right.’
‘I’ll be fine here. Please go and find Sue.’
Liz gave up her meditation after Henry left for the seventh time. Each time he came back with more blood on his face and his hands. It seemed that no blood was able to taint the magic Jian Ke clothes but it was also worrying that he couldn’t find Sue. 
Liz started to consider alternatives to the meditation. Looking at her pen, she had an idea.

Henry ran into the deep end of the battling ground for the seventh time. 
Each time before he broke into the largest clusters, he always imagined Sue in the middle surrounded by hundreds of vampire soldiers; but he had failed to find her so many times that this time he decided to try his luck at smaller clusters; and he hit the jackpot. After chopping his way through a thin vampire wall, he saw Sue straight away; she was fighting shoulder to shoulder with C1 and C2. 
‘Sue, it’s me!’ Henry yelled. He sliced a head off one vampire, kicked another one into C1’s jaws, and bumped a third into Sue’s lethal ring. Under attack from both sides, the thin vampire wall collapsed. The remaining enemy screamed and run away. ‘Are you OK?’
‘I’m fine. Where’s Liz?’
Henry opened his mouth, but C2 knocked him hard and he fell onto the ground. A red spark hit C2’s shoulder in the spot where Henry had been standing; the crocodile was thrown into the air, knocked Sue to ground and promptly fell on top of her. 
‘Sue, are you OK?’ Henry crawled towards her, keeping as flat as possible. Red sparks shot around him, showering chipped rocks and dirt over his body. C1 and C2 both lay still. Henry and Sue had been saved by C2’s fast, brave action.
‘I’m still alive,’ Sue moaned. ‘I think C2 just broke my leg, but he did save my life.’
Henry heaved C2’s body aside and freed Sue from underneath. He made a quick assessment and decided that only Sue’s shinbone was broken. He told her to crawl with him towards the cave where Liz was. Behind them, red sparks kept pouring all around; but due to the angle of the ground, none of the deadly sparks hit them.
Slowly, they made it to the cave. 
‘Are you all right?’ Liz asked.
‘We’re alive.’ Sue collapsed.
‘Where are you injured?’
‘No big deal, just a broken shinbone; what about you? Henry told me your legs are paralysed.’
‘I’m fine at the moment, still able to use my arms. I heard lots of explosions. Are the backpack killers heading this way?’
‘Not sure.’ Sue lay on the ground and stared at the ceiling.
‘There’s only one way to find out.’ Henry jumped to his feet and dashed towards the cave mouth. Liz’s whip flashed out and knocked him down as a red spark shot into the cave mouth, exploded, and made a basketball-sized hole in the wall.
‘I guess we just have to find another way out.’ Sue sat up, took out a little makeup mirror, and twisted her wrist gracefully; a round mirror spun out, making a smooth curve, and landed in the newly-made rock hole.
Liz gazed into the tiny mirror and gasped. She saw the group of backpacker soldiers, dressed as vampires, still carrying their backpacks and each holding a spark-thrower, approach their chamber cautiously but rapidly. 
The distance shrank quickly: fifty, forty, thirty, twenty metres. 
Henry suddenly jumped up and shouted, ‘I’ll throw out my sword...’
Liz said calmly, ‘Henry, please be patient. We can ambush them when they get into the chamber. How far can you throw your sword? You only have the one sword, so what are you planning to use afterwards?’
‘I can cast one of my rings,’ Sue said. ‘I do remember that I learnt about remotely controlling my rings in the Long Dream, but I’m afraid to try it. I suppose that we have nothing to lose now.’ She twisted her arm and her Yang Ring made a beautiful golden curve, swished around the corner and flew out of the chamber.
Liz stared into the little mirror and saw the golden ring glide over the USB crowd, and the first USB man become headless. The spark-thrower fell from his hand and exploded. The rest dived behind rocks for cover.
‘Well done, Sue!’ Liz suddenly saw Sue’s shoulders shaking violently, and heard Sue let out a painful moan. ‘What happened?’
‘Wait a moment.’ Sue waved her arms as if she was holding an invisible rope attached to the spinning golden ring. With a pleasant whistling sound, the ring flew back into the chamber. Sue caught it in the air, sat down and panted heavily.
‘What happened then, Sue?’ Henry asked.
Sue got her breath back. ‘The good news is I’m able to control the ring so we can attack them remotely. The bad news is when the ring is hit, I feel the pain.’
‘They’re advancing again.’ Henry pointed at the little mirror.
‘I’ll keep them down.’ Sue’s ring flew out again.
‘Be careful…’ before Liz finished her sentence, in the little mirror she saw a rain of red sparks shooting at the ring. Looking back, she saw Sue’s face was pale and her shoulders were shaking uncontrollably. 
‘Get your ring back, Sue!’ Liz and Henry shouted at the same time.
As soon as her ring flew back to her hand, Sue spat out a mouthful of blood. 
‘The bastards,’ Henry cursed. ‘They’re going to destroy your ring.’
‘Yes, but it won’t be that easy.’ Sue threw her ring out again; however, this time she didn’t let it fly too far, and most of the red sparks hit the rocks outside the chamber’s mouth. 
‘Not a bad run, Sue.’ Liz felt a bit of relief. ‘As long as your ring is still flying, they’ll not dare to walk in, but we have to think of a solution.’ Liz saw the Monster King’s animal monsters and the vampire army were still glued together in battle. There was unlikely to be a quick victory for either side.
‘Yes, I agree. Any ideas?’ Henry asked.
‘I do have an idea: painting a real dragon so it can destroy these USB men for us. But the problem is I’m unable to use my magic pen.’
‘It’s pity that Li Ping didn’t have time to teach you in the Long Dream.’ Sue joined the conversation after getting hold of her ring again. She sent it spinning out again.
‘Li maybe already told you how to use the pen, but you forgot,’ Henry said. ‘Maybe you don’t need anybody teaching you, but you just haven’t got your mind in the right direction.’
Liz didn’t answer. She had been trying all her Far Shu and their combinations for a while with no result.
‘I don’t know if this helps or not.’ Sue caught her ring again. ‘I suddenly remembered the story your father told us on your birthday dinner, right after he gave you the pen. I can’t remember the exact title; something like you need to have a full bamboo in your heart before you paint it.’ She cast her ring out again.
Liz shouted. ‘Yes! Sue, you’re absolutely right!’ In that instant, Liz understood why she had been unable to paint anything before then. Closing her eyes, she let the image of a Chinese dragon slowly form on her eyelids: the stag horn, camel head, demon eyes, python body, carp scales, eagle claws, tiger soles, cow ears ... After every single detail was outlined, Liz opened her eyes.
‘Henry, can you lift me?’
Holding his shoulder, Liz twisted her wrist, and her whip turned back to a pen again. She stroked it over the rocky wall, and they all let out a cheer: a trace of black ink gleamed on the rock. 
Sue screamed suddenly; she was thrown sidewards, banging into the rock wall. She slid down and lay huddled and still. Liz glanced in the mirror and saw the soldiers step out of their hiding places and advance towards the chamber; they had shot down Sue’ ring.
Henry put Liz down and rushed to Sue. He held her and checked her pulse; she was alive. With a painful moan, Sue opened her eyes. ‘I think I’ve broken my arm or my shoulder.’
Henry felt Sue’s right arm from shoulder to wrist, and said. ‘You’ve dislocated your shoulder. Hold on tight.’ Holding Sue’s elbow with one hand, he gripped her shoulder. ‘Sue—ready, one, two, three…’ He suddenly pushed and then jerked Sue’s arm. There was a sickening click sound, and Sue yelled.
‘Are you OK?’ Liz asked.
Sue wiped tears and sweat off her face, moved her arm a bit, and then moved it a bit more. She gave a white grin. ‘As good as new, thanks.’
‘They’re getting closer,’ shouted Henry.
‘Liz, you’d better hurry painting the dragon, and I’ll deal with them.’ Sue spun out her silver ring. 
The USB men dived behind rocks and tried to shoot the silver flash with a storm of red sparks. ‘Well done, Sue!’ Liz and Henry turned back to the rock wall, and she started to paint the dragon.
Liz’s pen grew long, long enough to touch the top of the high chamber. She was amazed to see colour pouring from the pen onto the surface; shapes appeared in front of her eyes. It was almost as if her pen was driving her hand to bring what was in her mind into reality. Liz immersed herself in her task of creating a real dragon. Explosions, Sue’s moans, the noises of weapons crossing and creatures screaming faded. She progressed rapidly and smoothly. 
Every detail of the dragon was completed except the scales. 
The dragon was very long—enormous. Liz had painted it over the entire length of the cave, at least twenty metres long and two stories high. She wanted her dragon to be as powerful as possible. Looking at its talons, Liz nodded with satisfaction.
‘What a great dragon!’ 
Henry put Liz down, stepped back and enjoyed the painting. He turned to Liz and shouted suddenly, ‘Liz, your face.’
Liz realised what Henry was shouting about; she had been using her Qi to suppress the evil energy inside her body, but while painting the dragon, she had completely forgotten about it. Now she felt it creeping into her head and trying to take control. Her heart juddered, and she put her hand over it to still it.
Tortoise Hibernation was the first thing that came to Liz, and she immediately started the meditation, but something was wrong. She felt a stream of energy surge towards her head, almost like the self-destruction Far Shu she used earlier to activate the paper cut soldiers. Without thinking, she automatically struck her right palm down on the top of her head, but her left hand lay on her heart.
The mix of Qi and evil energy hit her hard. Liz was completely paralysed, unable even to blink her eyes.

Painting the Dragon’s pupils

Fortunately Liz was still able to see, hear and think. 
What should she do now? She needed to let Henry and Sue knew what had happened to her. She thought about connecting to Sue, but listening to her cursing and painful moaning, decided to try Henry first.
She concentrated hard, and Henry responded. ‘Are you speaking to me, Liz? I thought you were in meditation…’
‘Henry, listen to me carefully,’ Liz spoke slowly and firmly. ‘I’m completely paralysed. You’ll have to help me finish painting the dragon.’
‘What? You want me to finish the painting? Sue,’ he called, and told her the problem.
Sue was still focusing on her rings, and suffering badly from the pain of the damage being done. She gasped, ‘Whatever you have to do, just please hurry. I don’t know how long I’ll be able to keep going. They’ll shoot down my last ring at any moment.’
‘I don’t know how to use your magic pen,’ Henry said to Liz.
‘Henry, you’re my twin brother and we have same blood flowing in our veins, so you should be able to use it. Listen to my instructions and then imagine what each scale looks like; then paint it on the rock. If you picture it correctly, the pen will do it for you. OK, let’s start with the dragon’s belly.’
Henry began well. He painted a small section under the dragon’s belly.
‘Oh, hurry,’ Sue wept as pain swept over her. She flung her rings out again. 
Henry jabbed at the rock hastily. ‘There’s so much to do!’ He swept the brush over the rocks, trying to cover them quickly. As soon as the scales he painted were not the same as Liz’s instructions, they disappeared the minute he lifted the pen off the rock surface.
‘I can’t do this. It doesn’t work,’ Henry kicked the rock angrily.
‘Stop it, Henry. Calm down, and take a deep breath. Henry, please.’
He tried again but failed again. On his tenth failure, he shouted, ‘Sorry, Liz, I just can’t do it; it’s not my personality. I rather die in the battlefield than endure this kind of torture…’ He chopped his sword against a rock nearby, threw it on the ground and hit his head with his fists. 
‘I know you can do it. Please calm down.’ Liz repeated the words in her mind over and over again.
The battle noises and red explosion, mixed with Sue’s painful crying, filled Henry’s mind, but slowly he calmed down, took a few deep breaths and pushed the pen against the rock again. He failed again. He did not give up but tried again, and failed again…He took more deep breaths, closed his eyes for a moment, and tried once more. On his tenth try, a perfect scale stayed on the rock.
From time to time he became agitated and angry, but he managed to calm himself again. Slowly, slowly, the dragon was covered with scales. Finally, Henry completed the last scale on the dragon’s back. 
‘Now paint its pupils.’ Liz prayed that it would work.
Henry focused, and dabbed at the dragon’s eyes. Nothing happened. He tried again and again, getting more agitated as Sue’s screams became louder. Finally, he threw the pen to the floor. A sharp scream filled the chamber. Sue was thrown high in the air, and landed on the rock with a thud. Henry rushed to her. Liz, facing the rock wall, was unable to see what was happening. 
‘She’s breathing,’ Henry called to her. ‘Unconscious.’ He began to slap Sue’s face. 
Liz imagined the USB soldiers slowly emerging from their rocks and inching towards the chamber. They’d be cautious and slow at first, but when no ring flew out, they’d blast in with a deadly rain of fire. She wondered how long they had: five minutes? She rather doubted they would wait that long.
Her eyes were sore and dry from being unable to blink. She focused on the only thing she could see, one of the dragon’s claws. 
Had all hope been lost? 
Liz wasn’t scared of death. In a short time she had experienced many near-death situations. But she thought about Fred, sorry she was unable to save him, and about Sue and Henry, and Mum and Dad...DAD!!!.
Why didn’t she ever think about to trying to reach to him, to build a mind-connection with him? Liz heard the soft thud of cautious boots as the USB soldiers moved across the loose rocks outside; there was not a second to lose. She concentrated, trying to put her father’s image in her mind. 
Nothing.
An explosion blasted through the cave mouth, sending dust and rock and pressure inside. Red sparks flared close to where the three were hidden. Liz tried harder. Still nothing happened. 
She heard Henry shout. ‘Liz, I’ll get at least three of them so we can get even. I love you very much.’ Liz could visualise her brother standing behind a rock holding his sword.
This was her last chance. Liz poured all of her power into concentrating and connecting to her father. In that moment, Liz heard her father’s voice in his strong accented English, right behind her. ‘What’s wrong, Liz?’
Liz was unable to turn her head to see if her father really stood behind her, and she didn’t have time to waste. ‘I was paralysed during Tortoise Hibernation by some evil energy in my body; and I painted a dragon, but I can’t paint its pupils to bring it alive. Dad, if you are behind me right now, please help; otherwise, we’ll all be dead.’
‘Slow down, Liz; you’ll have time. Painting a dragon’s pupils needs extreme power—no one has ever been able to do it more than once. When painting its pupils, keep your eyes locked with its, so you’re the first person it sees, and then it will answer to you alone. You’ll be its master.’
‘Dad, I’m paralysed.’
‘I’ll help you to unblock your Qi channels, but remember that you only have sixty seconds before the evil energy takes over your mind…’
‘Thanks, Dad.’ Liz felt her father’s Sword Fingers and Palm Knife jab various spots on her back, her shoulders and her neck, in fast succession. It worked —too well—Liz was thrown high in the air as her Qi started circulating again. 
‘One, two, three…’ Liz counted in her head as she picked up her pen; she turned, and saw her father standing before her, but before she could say anything, the first soldier entered the cavern, his flame-thrower at the ready. He pointed it at Liz and steadied it against his hip.
He didn’t see Henry behind a corner of the rock. A green sword slashed through his neck. His head bounced among the debris, and his weapon exploded. Liz stared in fascination and horror.
‘Paint the dragon’s pupils!’ her father shouted.
‘Eight, nine, ten…’ Liz touched the dragon’s eyes delicately with her pen. Two shiny black dots appeared. Sparks lit the scales red. Turning, Liz saw six soldiers appear, their weapons blasting. The sparks shot over her head and blasted the rocks into flying splinters. Out of the corner of her eye, Liz saw her father disappear.
A loud roar!
It was so loud that it muffled the thunder of the battle, the cracks of the sparks. The dragon lifted his head from the rock, opened his mouth, and shot out a jet of water. The soldiers were blasted into mid-air, smashed against the rock wall, and turned into bloody meat pies. The weapons in their hands exploded.
The dragon stared at Liz without further action. She wondered if he had seen her when he first opened his eyes; the answer seemed to be yes. ‘Twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two…’ Liz counted as she jumped high, mounted the dragon, wrapped her legs around his neck and commanded, ‘Fly out.’
With another roar, the dragon launched himself and burst out of the cave. Liz had painted him over twenty metres long, but he was growing longer and bigger as they flew high in the air. She just had time to see the remaining group of soldiers shoot a rain of red sparks at her before she was lifted towards the ceiling. A few clusters of red sparks hit the dragon’s belly, but Liz only heard a few muffled hisses as if something on fire was being immersed in water. 
Thirty, thirty-one, thirty-two… Liz commanded her dragon to dive at the source of the red sparks. She got her whip ready, and when she was in striking distance, jerked her arm so that her whip shot out like a long broadsword. Two men were sliced down and their weapons exploded. As she was lifted upwards again, she looked back and saw the dragon’s tail knock three more men high in the air.
Forty, forty-one, forty-two… The dragon dived at the enemy. Liz focused on the only two who had taken off their vampire masks. Ronald and Terry: her whip aimed at Terry’s chest.
Ronald shot out two red sparks and hit the dragon in both eyes. The dragon’s huge body dissolved in a crackle of fire, and Liz found herself falling. A spark struck Liz’s chest, but her whip had already flashed out.
She felt explosions inside and outside her body as she crashed to the ground near the men. She could see grey smoke trickling from her mouth and nose. She smiled; she saw her whip penetrate Terry’s chest. 
Even when Ronald pointed his weapon at her she kept smiling and didn’t even blink. Ronald stared at her for a few moments and then, to her great surprise, saluted her. He took out a blue light ball and tossed it up, and a blanket of smoke covered everything.
When the smoke thinned and Liz could see again, the Vampire King’s hooked nose appeared above her. She heard his high-pitched laughing.
‘I will kill you this time.’ His claws stabbed at Liz’s eyes. 
He never saw the flying sword.
Liz smiled more as Henry’s sword penetrated the Vampire King’s heart. Then she felt a heavy blow inside her head, and fell into darkness.

Henry had rushed out of the cave just in time to see Liz and her dragon shot down. He saw the smoke and then the Vampire King leaning over her, and, threw his sword with all his power. The Vampire King’s last scream filled the huge cave. The battle stopped as everyone looking around to see what had happened. 
As soon as the vampire soldiers realised their king was dead, they panicked and ran towards the tunnels, but the animal monsters killed most of them before they got that far. 
The battle was over.

‘What happened?’ 
Henry heard Sue’s voice; she leaned against a rock to support herself. 
‘Liz is down.’ 
Lying still, Liz looked peaceful. She still held her dragon whisker whip. Sue struggled over to her, sank down, and cried.
Henry knelt and took Liz’s wrist. He looked at Sue in dismay. ‘There’s no pulse.’ 
The Monster King, now a human body and bear head, walked over. ‘I’m sorry she has died. She was the greatest warrior I ever saw.’
Henry didn’t answer him, still holding Liz’s wrist. The Monster King shook his huge brown head and walked away. 
Henry scanned the cave but was unable to focus on anything in particular. He felt detached from reality, as if he was watching a movie. Vampire and animal monster bodies were everywhere. Wounded creatures howled in pain. He saw the Monster King take some wooden containers and pass them to the bears behind him. They walked among the wounded, scooping out black sticky paste from the containers and applying it to wounds; gradually, the screaming stopped. The king and his bears used wooden sticks to stab the hearts of injured and dead vampires.
Through tear-blurred eyes, Henry saw two figures approaching. He wiped his eyes and recognised the two crocodiles, C1 and C2. They were still alive! Henry couldn’t imagine how they had survived the red sparks, but he was not too interested in that right now.
‘Don’t pull me back. I want to pay tribute to my master,’ one of the crocodiles said.
‘You need to behave yourself in front of our master’s best friends,’ the other crocodile replied.
‘Sorry, master’s best friend—I’m C1. May I pay my last respects to my master please?’ the first crocodile asked.
‘Me too—I’m C2’ added the second crocodile.
Henry moved aside to let the crocodiles close.
Kneeling in front of her, C1 stuck his long nose over Liz’s face and sniffed.
C2 tugged C1’s elbow. ‘What are you doing? Stop it.’
C1 sniffed for a few more seconds, and turned to Sue. ‘My master is not dead.’
Sue wiped her tears with the back of her hand, ‘What? How do you know she isn’t? Her pulse has stopped.’
‘I don’t know what a pulse is, but I can still smell her life.’
‘My dear White JK, C1 could be right. He has some special senses.’ the Monster King had walked over and joined in the conversation.
Henry’s eyes brightened. ‘Of course, she can’t be dead—we haven’t used the last help page yet!’

Potion

Sue fumbled inside Liz’s pocket for the diary. She tore the blank page off and read through; her expression became heavy. 
‘Is it another incomprehensible idiom or story?’ asked Henry.
‘No, it’s a potion, but almost impossible to make...’
‘Let me look!’ Henry was desperate.
‘No—I’ll read it out loud. We need to do it fast; we have to complete the potion in sixty minutes.’ 
‘I’ll keep an eye on the time.’ Henry pushed a button on his watch to start the countdown.
Sue cleared her throat. ‘It’s an ancient Chinese magic potion. First we need a pot. My respected Monster King, would you please kindly lend us a pot?’
‘No problem at all.’ The king put his huge hand into one of his many pockets and took out a tiny pot, not much bigger than a spoon.
‘It’s too small…’ But before Henry completed his sentence it grew into a pot large enough for three adults to sit in comfortably. 
‘What a magic pot!’ shouted Henry and Sue.
The Monster King laughed happily. ‘This is the least I can do to help your friend. I admire her courage and skill.’
‘OK, second step.’ Sue studied the potion instruction. ‘Red Cape Jian Ke, we need to apply the Five Elemental Yin Yang Far Shu to the pot.’ 
Sue and Henry held their palms over the pot. Gradually, colourful fog started forming inside green, red, golden, and black, curling around a multi-colour core, slowly at first, then faster and faster.
‘Next step.’ Sue hesitated a few seconds and said slowly, ‘Red Cape Jian Ke, you need to prick your fingers and drip blood into the pot.’
‘No problem.’ Henry withdrew his sword, ready to slice his fingers.
‘Wait, you had better listen to this first.’ Sue took a deep breath. ‘Each finger represents one tenth of your power. The more power you sacrifice, the better chance of the potion working, so you need to make your mind up how much power you are willing to sacrifice.’
Henry’s expression showed that he was making the hard decision—to gain supernatural power and be able to fight like a real sword guest had always been his dream, and now he needed to give that all up to save his sister. Sue sighed; she had her own hard decision yet to make.
In fact, Henry only hesitated for a couple of seconds, then laid his sword across the pot and grasped the blade firmly with both hands; the sharp edges cut all of his fingertips, blood dripping into the pot. A surge of colourful fog shot up and then subsided. Henry shook a bit and almost collapsed, but he gripped the edge of the pot to keep himself standing.
‘Put this on, stop the bleeding.’ The king smeared black paste on Henry’s fingers.
‘What is it?’ 
‘My magical medicine, to stop bleeding and pain at the same time. What are the other ingredients, White Cape JK?’
‘A brown bear’s toenails, teeth from a twenty-three-foot-long crocodile, the poison of a six-foot-tall spider and a piece of the liver of a hundred-foot snake.’
‘That’s all?’ asked the Monster King.
‘All the animals have to willingly donate their bits, and they all have to be one-and-a-half thousand years old.’
‘I can see why it’s almost impossible to make,’ said Henry.
‘I have all the ingredients you need—let’s start with me first,’ said the Monster King. ‘I thought you’d need my blood as well. Toenails—piece of cake.’ He walked towards the pot but was dragged aside by his adviser.
‘My respected Monster King, are you sure that you want to donate your toenails?’ Despite the chimpanzee monster’s whispering, Sue could hear what he had to say.
‘Why not? Not a big deal; I cut my toenails all the time.’
‘My respected Monster King, may I make myself clear on a few points?’ The chimpanzee glanced around and then whispered loudly, ‘When you drop your toenails into that pot, you are not merely losing your toenails,’ he paused, and stared at the Monster King’s face.
‘What are you trying to tell me?’
‘You will lose lots of your magic power. It’s your magic power they need to save her, not your toenails. If you don’t trust me, ask the White Cape JK.’
The Monster King looked up. ‘Is it true I’ll lose power if I drop my toenails into that pot?’
‘Yes, your most respected Monster King; but it doesn’t say how much power you’ll lose.’
The chimpanzee looked agitated, and spoke loudly. ‘You’ll lose a lot of your power, my respected Monster King. I’ll demonstrate for you.’ He leapt forwards, surprisingly fast, landing in front of Henry. Sue gasped as the chimpanzee monster’s hand gripped Henry’s arm. She knew how strong an ordinary chimpanzee could be, and this magical monster would be able to tear Henry into half, particularly now he had just lost most of his power.
Henry slithered sidewards a split second before the chimpanzee’s claws touched him. Henry’s two hands, fingers flat and touching to form a triangle, posed in front of him. Henry hissed. Sue knew instantly that Henry was using Snake Fist. Henry’s hands, like a snake’s head, stabbed at the chimpanzee’s vital energy points, to jam chimpanzee’s inner energy’s circulation, but the monster was too fast for Henry. Judging from his movements, Sue estimated that at the most, Henry had a tenth of his original power. This was a far more dangerous battle for him than all the previous ones added together; he didn’t have the agility to avoid the attack. She suppressed a scream as he was knocked high in the air, landed hard, and threw up a mouthful of blood. The chimpanzee leapt at him again. Henry was punched, kicked and thrown in the air, but the monster was unable to grab him. The monster sneered. ‘You should not have sacrificed so much of your power—now you can not even save your own life.’
‘We haven’t finished yet.’ Henry struggled up, wiped blood from the corner of his mouth, and posed in the Snake Fist posture again.
‘You’ll be finished right now!’ the chimpanzee shot out his long arm and gripped one of Henry’s hands. 
Sue felt her heart sink; Henry would have no chance to survive —he’d be torn to pieces in the chimpanzee’s powerful arms. Then she realised that Henry had made a life-and-death gamble—he had intentionally let himself be caught.
As soon as he was pulled close to his opponent’s body, the fingertips of Henry’s free hand rapidly stabbed at a series of points from the chimpanzee’s stomach to his chest. The monster froze like a statue. 
Sue let out a deep breath of relief. Henry had escaped certain death. If his inner-energy-jamming tactic had not worked, he’d have been torn to pieces.
Henry struggled to remain standing. ‘My respected Monster King, I’m sorry to have done this to your adviser. Could you please tell him that he can continue the fight later, but for now we need to make the potion. We don’t have much time to waste.’
‘Please release him,’ the Monster King said.
Sue picked up some small rocks and threw them at the statue. After the rocks hit a few points on his body, he was able to move again. With an angry roar he leapt at Henry, but after hearing the Monster King’s even louder roar he stopped and walked away reluctantly. He whispered to his king again but Sue could hear him clearly. ‘Now you know that there is not much power left in his body, so, my respected Monster King, do you really want to lose your power? I don’t see any value in saving her. All her magic soldiers have been destroyed, and so has most of the vampire army; the Vampire King himself is dead. Basically, we need her help no longer, so why should you make a sacrifice to save her life?’
‘What do you think we should do then?’
‘Kill them all, and you will be the real king in the world.’ The chimpanzee’s teeth showed yellow as he grinned widely.
The few seconds before the Monster King spoke felt like eternity to Sue. All their lives were tied to what the Monster King would say next. For some strange reasons, she even hoped the end would come soon so she didn’t have to face the hard choice she still had to make.
The Monster King thought for a few moments and shook his heavy head, ‘No! I don’t want to kill them, and I am not interested in being king of the world. She is a real warrior, one of the few I have really admired in my whole life. Regardless of how useful she’d be, I want to save her.’ The adviser wanted to say more, but the Monster King walked away firmly. Putting his left hand over the pot, ‘Are my fingernails OK?’ he asked Sue.
‘Yes, thanks, my most respected Monster King.’ Sue felt great relief; they had just escaped another potential disaster.
As the Monster King’s fingernails dropped into the pot, the fog surged up, and his body shook.
‘Are you all right?’ Sue asked.
The Monster King shook his bear head and laughed. ‘No problem at all. I haven’t lost much of my power, not much at all.’
‘Thank you so much for your generosity. We’ll be in your debt forever, my most respected Monster King.’
‘That’s what friends are for. What’s next?’
‘I’m happy to give my teeth to my master.’ C1 walked forward, but was pulled back by C2.
‘You’re not qualified. Your mouth is too short.’
‘I’m sure that I’m longer than twenty-three feet.’
‘C1, come here.’ The king interrupted their argument. ‘Open your mouth; hold tight, it’ll hurt a bit.’ He whacked C1’s teeth with his war axe. 
‘Here are three teeth, more than you bargained for.’ The Monster King threw the teeth, still dripping blood, into the pot, and turned around. ‘Spider girl, come forward to help your new master’s friend.’
The elegant, dark-skinned girl stepped forward. She laughed shyly. ‘Excuse me for this.’ Her laugh changed from a human sound into insect buzz. Her head transformed from a beautiful girls’ into a huge hairy spider’s. The spider put its mouth into the pot, and spat a stream of poison into it.
‘I haven’t seen a hundred-foot snake around,’ Henry said.
‘They are both over a hundred feet.’ The Monster King pointed at two monsters with snake heads. One of them was wounded, his front covered with dried blood; he was propping himself up against the other snake’s shoulder. The Monster King beckoned them forwards. ‘Elder snake, I need a slice of your liver. I hope you understand it’s crucial for us to save the Black Cape JK. You will lose your life but save our army.’
The wounded snake monster nodded. ‘Monster King, you are my master, and I always obey your orders, even if it means losing my life. I’ll die happy to know it would save our army of monsters. Please do it.’ He staggered forward, tore his shirt open to bare his chest, looked straight up, and held very still.
‘I’ll remember your loyalty and your contribution to our army.’ the Monster King swung his war axe, chopping at the snake monster’s chest. Henry hadn’t expected things to happen so fast; when he saw what the king intended, it was too late to stop him.
A war fork collided with the swinging war axe. The younger snake monster stepped in front of his wounded brother. 
‘What are you doing?’ the king roared.
‘Please, Monster King, kill me instead.’
‘You are underage! Only one thousand four hundred and ninety years old. Step away.’
‘No, I won’t let you kill my brother.’
‘How dare you disobey my order? I’ll kill you as well.’
Henry leapt forward. ‘Please, my respected Monster King, can I have a word with you?’
‘Wait a minute—I’ll kill these two traitors first.’
‘No, please don’t kill them. You don’t need to kill them.’
‘What? What do you mean I don’t need to kill them? Don’t you need a snake’s liver?’ the Monster King took one step back and stared at Henry.
‘Well, what I mean…’ 
Before Henry managed to finish, the young snake leapt sideways. His body changed as he launched himself in the air; his body stretched out and transformed into a huge python. 
He flashed toward Henry and wrapped him in thick coils until only Henry’s face was visible.

Jian Ke – The Sword Guest

‘How dare you? Release him immediately or I’ll kill you,’ the Monster King roared.
‘Kill me if you wish, but you know I’ll squash him into pieces if I die.’ the python spoke in a windy hiss. ‘Monster King, I’m not intentionally disobeying your order. My elder brother always looked after me as if he was my father. We both followed you and fought thousands of battles. If he had been killed in the battlefield, I’d feel happy for him—but not if he is killed for this woman, a human woman. We don’t need a human woman to protect us. Monster King, I’ll fight for you until my death.’
‘This is totally unacceptable. Release him, and I’ll only kill you and your brother; otherwise I’ll kill all your relatives. Do you want that to happen?’
‘Monster King, you know as well as I do I don’t have any relatives except my elder brother. Other snake monsters are unrelated to me.’
‘Please can I have a word?’ Henry struggled to take a breath. ‘Young snake, listen to me carefully: I can slice a piece of liver from your brother without killing him—that’s what I tried to tell Monster King earlier.’
‘You lie! How can you cut his chest open but not kill him? How could he not die after losing a piece of liver?’
‘It’s modern medical technology; we do this kind of operation in hospitals all the time. His liver will grow back to its full size soon after the operation,’ Sue said softly.
‘Young snake, release him and let him do the operation. This is my last order to you.’
‘You are all lying to me; you only want to save her life. You would not care if we died or not. How can I trust any of you?’
‘I give you my word, young snake.’ Henry said calmly. ‘If your brother dies after the operation, you can kill me in revenge.’
‘And how do I do that? If I release you now, I’ll be killed instantly.’ 
Noise was everywhere. Everyone was trying to find a solution but the others argued, particularly C1 and C2. Henry could not do much except struggle to take each breath. Then he heard a clear voice. 
‘Take me.’
It suddenly became very quiet. 
Sue said it again. 
‘Young snake, please take me instead. Release him and let him to do the operation. If you elder brother dies, you can kill me.’ She struggled to stand up on her uninjured leg, and hopped to within two steps of the huge python.
‘OK, let’s do that.’ The python wiggled and flashed out; Sue was entangled until even her face was invisible; Henry was thrown aside. 
He stood up, ‘Sue, are you OK?’
‘I’m OK,’ Sue said from inside the pile of python’s body, in an obviously painful voice.
Henry was stunned. Only a few days ago, Sue screamed at a few rats and cockroaches—now she was willing to be wrapped by a python. 
‘Don’t wrap her too tight so she can breathe easily.’
‘She’ll be all right. Just go ahead with your operation. Remember your promise.’
Henry walked towards the elder snake and the Monster King, ‘Monster King, can I have some of your ointment to stop the bleeding afterwards? Elder snake, can you change back to your snake form please?’
The elder snake monster nodded. He lay down, and wriggled, and in an instant there was a python. 
‘Monster King, can you please mark exactly where the liver is, so I can do the operation.’
The king marked a red circle the size of a dinner plate on the huge body. ‘Cut here. His liver is exactly twenty inches deep.’
‘Can you make him sleep?’
 ‘No, I need to check if he is still alive during the operation.’
‘That’ll be very painful,’ Henry argued.
‘I’ll be all right. Please hurry to save your friend’s life,’ the elder snake monster said.
‘OK, Monster King, can you get your bleed-stop ointment ready. We’ll need lots.’
‘I have plenty.’ the Monster King put the ointment container on the ground. It grew larger and larger, becoming the size of bathtub.
Taking a deep breath, Henry picked up his sword. He gazed at the red circle and suddenly stabbed into the python and sliced down. Blood gushed. Thrusting one hand into the wound to hold it open, he slid his sword inside; he twisted it slightly, withdrew, and held up a piece of blood-dripping tissue. Elder snake’s body wiggled violently; a rock exploded under the force of his tail. 
Henry thrust his sword into the huge ointment container, coming out with a large chunk of the ointment. He stuck the tip of his sword into the wound he had made, twisted a bit, withdrew, and wiped the rest of the ointment over the gushing wound. As soon as the cream touched the wound, it formed a black lump and the bleeding stopped.
‘Elder brother, talk to me! Are you still alive?’ the young snake hissed.
‘How do you feel, Elder Snake?’ Henry wiped the blood from his hand onto his shirt. His Jian Ke top still had no bloodstain at all, despite the amount of blood that had gushed on him during the operation.
The elder snake’s body lay very still, and then twisted a bit, and his huge mouth opened. ‘I’m all right. Red Cape JK, thank you for keeping me alive. Young brother, please release White JK.’
‘Quick! We need to make Liz drink the potion!’ Henry shouted.
Sue, thrown out by the young snake, held on to Henry’s arm and hopped towards Liz. Henry held his sister against his chest, while Sue fed her the newly-made potion. Everyone watched Liz’s reaction closely.
Liz’s body started to shake. The tremors became more intense. Black smoke came out of her mouth, nose and ears, forming a large black ball hovering over her face.
Sue knew the moment had come.
At the very end of the potion recipe, it was written that someone who had a close relationship with Liz had to inhale the black smoke; this was the only way to get rid of the poison; otherwise, it would be inhaled back into Liz’s body and she would die instantly. If the consequence of inhaling the black smoke ball had been death, Sue would have been more than happy to give her life to save Liz’s; but the choice was a far more difficult one —her face would be disfigured. It would be worse than dying to live with a vampire’s face, with long fangs, sunken eyes, and hooked nose. Sue would rather be dead, definitely.
But the reality was that she had to willingly inhale the poison smoke ball; in order to save her friend, Sue had to accept the fact that she would live with a disfigured face for the rest of her life. She could not even sacrifice her own life to do the task. 
While the python had entangled her, Sue had wished it would kill her so she wouldn’t have to make the decision, even though she had felt shame at the thought. She was selfish to have wished that. 
Sue made up her mind.
Becoming a fashion model was her lifetime dream, but now it seemed that she had to give it up, together with many of her other dreams, if she wanted to save her friend’s life. So be it. There were worse things in one’s life than disfigurement.
Sue closed her eyes and inhaled hard.

As the black smoke hovered over Liz’s face, Henry raised his hand to get rid of it, and then thought he had better ask Sue what to do first. Then he saw Sue inhale hard; the smoke moved towards her slowly. Without thinking, he did the same.

Liz opened her eyes, seeing a strange round lump of smoke hover over her. She saw Henry and Sue both inhaling hard. She immediately realised what they were doing. Without a moment’s delay, she inhaled hard as well.
The ball was torn into three parts and disappeared into each of their noses. Liz jumped to her feet and hugged Sue and Henry, who rejoiced with tears and cheers.
Epilogue

Henry and Sue explained to Liz what had happened, and Liz thanked the Monster King and his fellow monsters for saving her life. 
They discussed how Liz had survived a direct hit from a red spark. Henry’s theory was that the combustion of Liz’s Qi and the evil energy inside her body was so strong that the power of the spark was neutralised. 
‘This also helped to save my life.’ Liz took out the diamond and told Henry and Sue what had happened to Professor Smith. ‘Without the sacrifice of Professor Smith, Professor Blanc and his fellows, and Fang’s grandfather, our survival would have been impossible.’ Henry and Sue asked Liz how she managed to activate the magic soldiers. Even while she explained what had happened, Liz was wondering: why didn’t her father tell her the solution more clearly? If she hadn’t worked it out in that split second, she would have died. But she realised quickly: if her father had told her the solution earlier, she would not have been able to apply the self-destruction Far Shu—one had to truly believe it was a last resort or it would not work. Besides, if her father were one of the Jian Ke, he would know the consequence of directly telling Liz the Far Shu—revealing Liz’s identity and therefore causing her to lose the power gained from the Long Dream.
Since Liz had seen the silk portraits of three Jian Kes in China, she had wondered why Li Ping hadn’t recognised her father after knowing him for so many years. There was also an age problem—he was obviously not over a thousand years old. At that moment, Liz was amazed that she actually found a perfect explanation for so many impossibilities—her father was the reincarnation of the Black Cape Jian Ke.
Fourteen years ago, Li arrived in Perth at the same time as Liz was born, so it was not purely coincidence. Li must have known that he was the Black Cape Jian Ke’s reincarnation, and waited patiently for him to remember who he was in his previous life. Unfortunately when he remembered, Li never had a chance to speak to him. Liz shook her head sadly. She was surprised that she had managed to figure all of those things out at once; smiling to herself, she thought she might just have had a Taoist sudden-enlightenment.
Although Liz wanted to tell Henry and Sue how she had connected to her father, how he materialised behind her, how he unblocked her Qi channels and helped her paint the dragon’s pupils, she decided against it. Henry hadn’t seen or heard anything during their father’s sudden appearance, and she wasn’t sure if she had really seen him—the whole thing could have been pure imagination. But one thing was sure—her father did help her through all of those life and death adventures with his ancient Chinese folk stories, and now she wanted to know him better, or at least pay more attention to his tales. ‘We should never underestimate our fathers,’ Liz said as she finished her story.

Sue wasn’t sure if the poison smoke ball would disfigure her face because she only inhaled a third of it. Secretly she took her mask off and checked; everything seemed normal She was not convinced that everything would be fine in future, but she was happy to forget about it for a while. Of course, Sue didn’t tell either Liz or Henry about the disfiguration part. The Monster King put some kind of bad-smelling paste on her broken leg and it healed her injury in an instant so she was able to walk normally again.

Henry felt that he hadn’t completely lost all of his powers; maybe one tenth of them remained, as his best guess. After inhaling the smoke, he sensed some foreign energy circulating around his Qi channels. He was not certain if it was the evil energy Liz had experienced or something else; whatever it was, more energy would be better than none, as long as it didn’t cause him any trouble.

The Monster King forgave the young snake for disobeying his order, so everyone was happy. In the next couple of hours, Jian Ke, Fred, the minister and his companions and the animal monsters had a wonderful party to celebrate their joint victory over the Vampire King. 
The spider girl, now in full woman’s form with a beautiful girl’s face, demanded that Henry dance with her, one song after another. Because Spider Girl never let him go for the whole evening, Sue had good fun dancing with C1 and C2 instead. They wobbled their heavy tails in very funny ways.
Liz danced with Fred for the rest of the party. She blushed when Henry or Sue winked at her. From his gaze, Liz could tell that Fred had noticed her at last, and it made her extremely happy; however, she knew clearly that Fred did not love the fourteen-year-old school girl, but the Black Cape Jian Ke; besides, he already had a girlfriend. She did not want to think about that too much. She just enjoyed the moment.

Before they left, the Monster King gave Liz a bottle containing the remains of the potion. It was a magic bottle so it held a lot of the liquid. He showed them the tunnel leading outside, and said goodbye.
‘See you later, alligator,’ C1 waved to Sue.
‘In a while, crocodile,’ Sue replied laughing.
After the Jian Ke and the other humans disappeared into the tunnel, fireworks burst into mid-air.
‘Wow, that’s beautiful! I like the sword, the ring, and the whip,’ said C1.
‘You stupid croc, that’s the letters J and K. Together they mean JK. You need to be educated,’ said C2.
‘I knew that,’ C1 said.

Years later, underground cave explorers discovered a series of deep caves linking to Lake Cave, and many weapons and bones, both human and animal, in a huge chamber. The most interesting find of all was a huge painted Chinese dragon on the wall of a dead-end cave opening into the huge chamber. Archaeology tests dated the painting as one and a half thousand years old; but none of the experts in the field could explain how it could have come there, and it seemed it would be a mystery forever.

Author’s Note

I love fantasy and adventure stories. In the early years of my life in China, I was saturated with Chinese swordsman stories, particularly Louis Cha’s (金庸, Jīn Yōng) works. Later, after migrating to Australia, I started to read fantasy books in English. 

It was fascinating to see the cultural differences between East and West. In the East, the protagonists were always flying high in the sky and with super powers; in contrast, their Western counterparts usually had their feet set firmly on the earth. This really intrigued me, and made me wonder: what it would be like if I created a fantasy story and mixed east and west together?

Taoism (道, Daoism) is one of the oldest philosophies in the world, and has penetrated our daily lives; for example, Tai Chi, Yin Yang, and Feng Shui are all based on Tao. Taoism, rather than viewing the world in black and white, takes a more realistic and searching look at the grey. The classic example is Shakespeare’s famous quotation: “To be or not to be, that is the question”. For Taoism, it would change to “To be or not to be, that is the answer”. There are many books introducing Taoism to the west, and I would recommend The Tao of Pooh and The Te of Piglet if you want something easy to read to begin with. 

What I like about Taoism and Tai Chi is that they do not use force against force— a true way of using non-violence against violence. If we all viewed the world in more realistic ways and found more realistic ways solving conflicts, there would be far fewer wars and far less suffering, and this is one of the unspoken ideas behind my book.

My father had unconditional and blind faith in me to be successful, a kind of Chinese tradition (望子成龍). When I won the county math competition in high school, he told me that there were only a few more steps to go to become the world math champion. It is his unconditional belief in me that has kept me going with this book. Each time I wanted to give up, I would know that he was watching me from above.
