To my small prince 
To my family 
Because after all I am a tame fox 



Speaking of Dafne 
From child Dafne continually dreamt him/it. The man of the dreams was a true fixation. Breads and cartoons were grown to, and not rarely mother Dolores roused her/it in his/her cameretta to recite with conviction of it the most romantic scenes. The edge of the closet was perfectly lent to personify its rider, to which it often clinged hardly repeating the wisecracks of the episodes sights: 
«Oh, André, also I love you. The revolution waits us, but with I feel me to you to the sure one!» 
They were exhilarating scenes, an actress of cartoons deigns of Oscar. 
Spent Dafne the years of the innocence in the total conviction that a man of the dreams would also have arrived for her. And that day would not have been a closet but a young prestante with proper voice and enchanting aspect. 
Since the adolescence an awake and extremely original girl was shown. To the eyes of the contemporaries it often resulted strange, for many parents the classical girl with too many crickets for the head. It possessed an unbelievable dowry: it drew and it painted in sublime way. It was an eccentric creative. To twenty-four you/he/she would have purchased a reflex; after thousand photo, you go off to gust in alone two days, he/she thought that that gadget was prodigious, but it destroyed every thing. From his/her articulated point of view, the photo of precision exactly immortalized the things and the people as we sees her in the reality. For the most greater part of the people, this is the primary purpose of the photo; for Dafne, an injustice, that defined the beautiful and good homicide of the amusing part of the brain. 
Also its style was all of this that people often labored to understand. It never passed unnoticed. Naturally whimsical, one for which, in the good or in the evil, it always turns us. 
Did it have two piercing and three tattoos; butterfly, elf and tribal? Absolutely no. To adorn his/her body had chosen planned sketches and eccentric, that few would have had the opportunity of understanding; but it didn't interest at all after all her, that this happened. 
The day when Dafne went him to make the third tattoo, it entered the study a very refined girl, without doubt dressed of tall tailoring. Dafne observed the scene. The girl" serious" it hastily drew near to the counter and it turned him to the tatuatore, regardless of the people that anchor waited. 
«I want a dolphin on the right ankle, of around four, five centimeters; if I return to eighteen o'clock you make her/it in a hour?» 
Dafne didn't do in time to activate the silencer of his/her thoughts, and to big voice it expressed his/her opinion. 
«And then he/she wonders us because the dolphins are extinguished!» 
Ska, the tatuatore, looked at her/it for a long, endless instant and, nonchalant of the new client, he/she answered to the thought expressed by the friend. 
«Mah! Do you want to say that in the mesozoico they were tattooed the whole tirannosauro?» 
Dafne never understood because the girl" serious" went beating away the door and smashing her eardrums. But of sure, from those parts they would not have him more sight. 
The concept of fashion generally irritated her/it. Dafne had used for years the All Star when for the world they were sfigati shoes. When the world began to spend a fortune for those footwears, she stopped using her because he felt sfigata. It returned so, with endless appeasement, to the everlasting Clark color camel. Only when the fashion was years seventy, Dafne it seemed to the fashion. 
«When hands the leg jeans and bra in sight are one drugged! When the fashion imposes leg jeans with bra in sight are a correct tipa! You save the brain if I am me the crazy person!» 
This howled once to a friend speaking of fashion. 
I have not forgotten the physical description of Dafne. The delicate features of the face and the physicist were in perfect tuning with the personality; simple but out of the schemes, certain days left without words, in others they silently passed unnoticed. The color of its hair quickly changed; from the sixteen up to the twenty-six years you/he/she had changed innumerable shades. The recurrent tonality in its experiments had always been the red; red mahogany, red fire, black with flaming red locks, red carrot, red with traces of green on the points. Dafne would have lived painting, but life needed money. Already from ragazzina it feared that to paint would never have brought him of it enough. Not in Italy. But he/she didn't want to admit him/it, kind with his/her parents, that instead didn't lose occasion to do him him to notice. Often, approaching himself/herself/itself to the adult age, you/he/she was stopped to think about his/her future. He/she thought that perhaps you/he/she had not understood thing yet he/she wanted to do from great, and that it was better perhaps to return to a natural color of hair to look for the everlasting fixed place, in that frantic and hypocrite society in which you/he/she had had the adversity to be born. Crossed the crisis, it returned her in mind the love for the art, for the creativeness, what gave sense and life to every thing. Of hit cleared him and listened to music isolating himself/herself/itself from everything and from the ugly thoughts. It began to dream an ideal life; to be himself/herself/themselves in a cottage on top of a hill, contained by a small enclosure of colored wood, with one of those characteristics boxes of mail in American style and an I swing for two in the garden, in which to cradle him with the man of the dreams. Other times its preferred music transported her/it on the eyelash of a bluff; the wind disarranged her the long ones and thick hair. It was free. The dreams didn't guarantee money, but nobody could tear them to him. 
Dafne went away of house a lot of youth. In the first years of independence you/he/she was given to a variety of lavoretti, that somehow you/he/she was made pleasure, even though select to the solo purpose to disembark the almanac. You/he/she had worked for a long time in an art cafe. In that place, to her very dear, you/he/she had exposed various times his/her paintings, and this had thrilled her to excess. The art cafe had been its second house for a lot of time. You/he/she had worked us the first time in 2004, to twenty-four, and after various and tormented vicissitudes you/he/she was found to work again us a few years later. 
For one period you/he/she had collaborated with a social cooperative, brief experience but that you/he/she had allowed her to know very different reality from his; during the time of lunch it brought home meals to the sick or to the elderly ones of some peripheral districts in Milan, city where you/he/she had been born and grown. 
To hiss the people with a cold and incisive sentence was the genial peculiarity of Dafne. He/she didn't mind anything; that it knew you or less, for her it didn't do difference. If one is stupid it has the whole right to know him/it, this thought after having cooled someone. The truth and the purity of his/her own thoughts were for a long time untouchable dogmas of its life. Particularly it hated the injustices, above all those to load of people that judged defenseless. He/she didn't succeed in making him slip her I set, also at the cost to make himself/herself/themselves the blood water for matters not his/her. A particular anecdote to this intention was verified during the activity of the home meals. 
One Tuesday went to bring the lunch to Mrs Buzz, that called this way because of the sound of its bell; it seemed her one of that sonorous buttons of the television quizes. After having played him/it, immediately howled": The lunch has served!" Inexorably, the dog of Mrs Buzz got mad. After having announced his/her presence, Dafne took under the key from to the vase of cyclamens and entered. 
That particular Tuesdays, crossed the threshold of house, it placed the food and it directed as usual him in the kitchen to prepare. The lady was on his/her wheelchair, and she remained in an angle of the stay. When Dafne served capolino as the kitchen, it still flowed the elderly woman in his/her angolino, with in hand a silvered portafoto. It observed the photo of his/her/their daughter. 
«Here Christian was only twenty-six years old, have gone off her the day of the degree; is a good executive, rather managger, as say you young people! Be always very busy! But soon will see that calls me for the wishes! My mother, makes settantanove of it!» 
Dafne remained in silence. Did Mrs Buzz want to convince her or herself? 
The following day didn't touch to Dafne to bring the lunch the woman; definite however to pass to find her/it. The elderly one was very amazed in to receive that unexpected visit. Surprise stayed in even more the to see all of this that Dafne had brought her: sweets of every type, all rigorously tender and to test of denture. Mrs Buzz cried and thanked about ten times. 
After having eaten a sweet whole, Dafne asked to the lady if his/her daughter had called then her for the wishes. The woman had again the shiny eyes, that invaded that tired face of an overwhelming sadness. 
«Will surely have held back her in the office! Christian is so good, certain days cannot live just without her.» 
Dafne didn't say anything, the churches only at what time the badante would have arrived and if you/he/she could be her profit somehow. 
Before leaving the apartment, the girl stole for some instant the index book of the telephone and copied a number on his/her jail cell. Once in house it composed the number; on the other side they answered after two rings. 
«Salutes Christian, we don't know each other and you now excuse me since if I steal her precious time. I will try to put indeed us few to make her wishes for his/her settantanovesimo birthday.» 
Riagganciò without attending answer. 
That night Dafne fell asleep with sadness thinking about that tender oldie. Christian Vincents it fell asleep prey to the weeping, hopeful that did soon him day to go to his/her mother. 



Speaking of the parents of Dafne 
Dafne was born August thirteen th 1980 in Milan, with immense pain of mother his/her Dolores; a suffering of twenty-two weary hours. When it finally came to the light, all the presents were amazed; despite the long hours of work, its lines were made in little time rosy and extended as those of a doll. It was as if you/he/she had explained from immediately how much few would be upset in front of the difficulties of the life. 
Unique daughter remained. 
Dafne was grown in the clean feeling to be all of this that his/her parents would never have liked. In spite of this, was incredibly attracted among them, as if one strange chemistry tied them without reason, and she didn't even know how to explain him of it the motive. 
With the time you/he/she had understood that his/her parents could be as the fire for the small children: object of a great call but that inevitably, to every contact, it produces pain and disappointment. 
The situation was upset irreversibly when Dafne performed fifteen years. Its first year of classical high school was ended and you/he/she had been rejected. You/he/she would never have liked to attend that school of" bigots", as it defined the companions and the teachers that you/he/she had had the sorrow to know that year. 
From when it had memory, Dafne remembered pencil and piece of chalk as natural prosecution of his/her right hand. He/she wanted to draw and to live his/her best years among boys and teachers that loved the creativeness, rather than in the emotional piattume met in that school. Dafne hated extremely those that it defined" the alternative fighettis", or physicians' children, engineers and lawyers of the" Milan well", those that dressed of expensive rags make the false nonconformists and" they fight the system." His/her high school was full of it. 
The summer after the third average had been a terrible nightmare in the house of Dafne. His/her father said that the art was beautiful but that it had to leave to do her/it to the others. 
«Have to draw in the leisure time Daffy! Scribble is not at all a job! The job is what bread brings yourself in table. I won't pay you the school to learn to starve! Your mother and I have never had anybody that paid us the studies, and it looks what we are: workers of the cazzo without a lira aside!» 
Those words had been so often her repeated that, despite pits already a strong ragazzina and determined, you/they had created her an absurd sense of guilt. This way he convinced that it was correct to try with the classical one. 
It is sure what an active volcano can rest, to make silence and to appear a harmless hill, but in the bowel earth that burns always stays also. Dafne was one of that volcanos in apparent rest. Following the failure, an evening, definite to face his/her parents, with threatening air but at the same time extremely polite. 
«I cannot force to pay me to you a school that hate, therefore I will frequent in the daytime and I will look for a job for the evening. But I will do the artistic one.» 
This said, and with all the calm of this world it started to eat. 
To nineteen Dafne was dismissed by the artistic high school with the maximum one of the votes and a show of end year prepared, for good part, from his/her tables. 
But you/they had not been certain easy years. His/her mother had not allowed that she worked for paying him the school, and this had given her right to continuous recriminations. Despite everything, you/he/she was met with his/her husband, that continued instead to oppose himself/herself/themselves with energy to the choice of his/her/their daughter up to the last year. 
«You/he/she should work the evening and to make in the daytime his/her scribbles; so it understands what he/she means to work hard!» it sometimes howled dad Aldo. 
«We will pay her to us the school, exactly as we would have done for the classical one. When it will end to be a worker, while the other ones will be doctors and lawyers, then you/they will be done his/her, and it will get by!» it confirmed mother Dolores with false separation. 
Dafne didn't understand which of the two parents it behaved worse; if his/her father that didn't want to pay her school to avoid her a failure or his/her mother that he/she wanted to pay her/it to him in the hope of blaming her a failure. 
You/he/she had not succeeded in giving him a true answer, and you/he/she was never resigned to the idea that all the actions of that two were entirely tied up to the money. A daughter could give satisfactions however, also without becoming medical or lawyer. But this was a too abstract concept for a couple of cinquantenni that it probably looked for a ransom through his/her/their daughter, seen all of this that life had denied them. Dafne always hoped that his/her mother's attitude pits fruit of an extreme pride and that, after all, the woman wanted to leave her/it free to cultivate unintentionally his/her passion to admit him/it to his/her/their husband. Hope to which it tried to grab on for years. 
You metabolize these considerations, the girl started the worse one some adolescent rebellions; you/he/she would not be more properly made the scruples of the respectful daughter, doing what believed more opportune for herself. Out of the oppressive family boundaries, it would be alone had a good time. 
Already to sixteen you/he/she had tried a consistent number of drugs, to seventeen he/she regularly misused of it; you/he/she was intended to refuse the heroin thing that did without problems. Dafne wanted out andar of head, but you/he/she would never have allowed any substance to steal entirely her wish. 
In that period its excessive extravagance produced discussions to a little power on dir. His/her mother destroyed a dish when you/he/she discovered the first tattoos. 
But for the woman it was everything other the hit of grace in that period. An evening, during the supper, to the newscast they transmitted a news on the Pope. Without not even lifting the head from the flat Dafne he/she spoke: 
«Speaking of Pope, I don't intend to frequent the hours of religion anymore; a signature serves me for the school. It looks like minor wants to say incapable to intend and to want!» 
Where is the hit of grace? In the fact that the parents of Dafne were fervent Catholics. 
Not always the choices of Dafne were tied up to the pure taste to hurt them or however this thing happened not always in aware way. Dafne had not reached the religious refusal in unprovided way. You/he/she had listened to years of lessons and sermons on the matter, both to school and to catechism. Once read the Bible it found, from his/her point of view, numerous contradictions in comparison to the attitude typically Catholic. Definite so that you/he/she would not have allowed anybody anymore to enter his/her internal self to tell her if, who and as to pray. 
«I will never believe in a God that would allow the luxury that is in Vatican! Lourdes seems the business center of the holy water! And to believe in God doesn't serve to hymn him/it with other one hundred furred people on Sundays morning!» 
This told Don Peppe, when he/she met him/it one afternoon for road. 
Dafne understood that every choice of his was a stab for its family. But his had always been a double blade; it hurt them and at the same time it suffered for the constant received disapproval. You were an entity, a person, and as such it was not able and he/she didn't want to be only their copy for calm to live. You/he/she would have liked hopelessly a constructive dialogue, a comparison that unfortunately it seemed to never arrive. 
Also during the middle schools and the year of the classical one you/he/she had had the clean feeling of denied respect, yet its hair was of the natural color, it didn't smoke neither grass, neither cigarettes, frequented the mass and the time of religion. Then for them to do well or badly it was the same thing. They were cold and severe in every case, as from script. 
Aldo and Dolores were not bad people. The real problem didn't reside certain in the not love for his/her/their daughter. It was site, rather, in the absolute incapability to show him/it, as also in the extreme pride that united them. They never succeeded in giving test of their feelings. The received education and their lived complex had brought them to the complete emotional hibernation. A sweet or affectionate gesture was sign of weakness, thing that they could not afford. To show love and to grant him useless mawkishness, was for both one certain way to lose the control, and those two people hated extremely to lose the control. With his/her/their children it needed to use" baton and carrot"; sinned that, according to Dafne, the carrot you/they had lost her for road. 
The first years of marriage were a true struggle for the survival, without any certainty. His/her father had made every type of work, always rigorously in black and sottopagato. Most greater bitterness had sprung from the total absence of the family ones, in some cases for real impossibility, in others for pure indifference. It is sure what the two consorts learned soon not to need anybody, and they were also intended that nobody would ever have had nothing from them, you/he/she was also treated of a simple word of comfort. The Piedmontese factories were their first conquest of the north to the search of a stable job. With a stroke of luck they found good setup in the Milanese, where they definitely established him in 1979. 
Unfortunately, in this total and unnatural deprivation of the emotional sphere, Aldo and Dolores they raised an invisible and insurmountable wall, also with his/her/their daughter. To distance of years it was very difficult to establish if even between them some love had remained, or if rather the everything went on for the mutual respect of the sacred matrimonial tie. To the eyes of Dafne, only in two occasions they seemed accomplices and involved: during the mass and during the reading of the account in the bank. Just in this Dafne he/she saw their greatest contradiction: God and Money idolized in egual way. 
Unusual it was the touch of Dolores when definite to face with his/her daughter, by now teen-ager, the discourse on the sex. One Saturday evening, before the girl went out, you/he/she reached her/it in his/her room. 
«Dafne, has sexual relations?» 
Was the expression of his/her/their daughter enough for to make to understand her" certain, that believed?" The woman had a deprived reaction of logic. 
«In that school of toxic thing you were able out venir? Make an attempt to you not to return me home with the belly, Dafne! Remember well it every time that you go out of that door. how disgusting!» 
In reality, up to that evening, Dafne had jealously guarded his/her virginity. Dam was reserved in its world, and it would not be never granted to the first come. You/he/she had perhaps wanted to provoke his/her mother, he/she perhaps wanted to see its reaction. Had not you/he/she felt neither a word on the sure sex and on the risk of illnesses, neither a nice sentence of the type" we go together to the gynecologist?" Nothing of nothing, only an intentional sbotto. The only thought of the woman had been that to order to the daughter not to make to be impregnated. That Saturday Dafne went out with too many" perhaps" in the head and with the conviction that his/her mother considered her/it a puttana. A few times later, after a colossal drunkenness, you/he/she had lost the virginity with a boy of the fourth year that had been dying behind her for months, and that after that night you/he/she would never have recalled. 



Speaking of the man of the dreams 
Paradox of the paradoxes, the relationship between Dafne and his/her parents one day began to graze the normalcy; for the precision when, to twenty, the young woman went away of house. 
For the first two years it divided the apartment with two girls, a timid university student abundantly subsidized by his/her parents and a cubist that it maintained him the studies dancing in the disco. The two girls in matter were presences to a little irrelevant dir in the life of Dafne. They remained in his/her vanished memoirs as the tizies with which it halved the first lease. 
Ended the high school, Dafne thought more times to frequent the academy of art but the all it hardly diminished not immediately realized the number of years, increased by the cost of the straight lines and the material. It didn't even consider a second the idea to ask money to his/her/their parents, and also wanting, their point of view was spontaneously manifested after the examination of maturity: 
«If you will now decide yourself to make a serious faculty, then we can consider the idea to turn up us the sleeves and to pay you the university, but if you think about some other school from dead of hunger, not to count on us, this time seriously!» 
Dafne had withstood the years of the high school, over you/he/she would not have been possible. You/he/she had chosen the liberty; liberty from the senses of guilt, from the quarrels, from every sermon free borne. What during the adolescence had hurt her star more than every other thing, it was the total absence of" because"; if you/they had sometimes asked him him, Dafne you/he/she would have found that dialogue for a long time looked for, succeeding in explaining how come so much was hocked to be so different from them. You/he/she was embittered by the fact to have to discard pre-emptive the academy, but at least you/he/she would not have felt recriminations or threats anymore: you/he/she had chosen to begin to live without constantly feeling himself/herself/themselves inadequate. After all, according to Dafne, the art could not be taught in any academy, perhaps improved, but not taught; to twenty, or you have her in the blood, or you cannot invent her/it to you. The artistic high school had been enough, above all for a person that, as she, boasted an unbelievable natural dowry. To continue the studies, thought about something that was not too much binding and that you/he/she could open her a perspective of job. 
Dafne would have lived painting, but on this, it agreed as perhaps unconsciously with his/her father herself, it accepted; to paint was his/her life, but in the meantime it also had to eat. You left incuriosire from the advertising world, a very creative sphere that offered consistent working results in the Milanese. Many of his ex companions would be thrown on the graphics. Because not to try? After an accurate search, it chose a three year-old course in circle of communication and publicity, thanks to which refined particularly the design of the visual communication. 
The first periods it found job in a business center of the city, to the department you perfume. The salary part-time of that place was not quite badly, often rounded off from extraordinary. But as soon as job and study granted her truce, in a whatever angle of the city was defile for withdrawing something. 
That that in advertising circle Dafne labored to accept, it was that the computers were learning to draw to the place of the men. The everything was justified from the frenzy, from the elevated costs of that sector and from the tall possibilities that those cars furnished. The competitive advantage that you/they promised was indisputable, yet for Dafne it was very sad. 
It was 2001 when it began his/her school. It knew a lot of bright personalities, among aspirant arts designer, copywriter and about ten other figures tied to the world of the communication of mass. What studied liked her enough, even if its extremely reserved character indeed very in the middle of that jungle. The most greater part of that people would have made false papers to emerge, while Dafne, for his/her nature, it didn't not at all love to display its dowries. "The applauses are received, they don't wonder", this always said. 
Dafne knew the true love during that school; the man of the dreams very attended you/he/she had arrived. But as all the best cartoons years eighty, introduced him with more than few complexities. It was not a colleague of course, tantomeno a contemporary; to be similar to his/her originality, lost Dafne the head for the teacher of theories and techniques of the advertising communication of the third year. You were twenty-three years old. For everybody, he was Professor Roberto Chellini; for Dafne it became soon" Bob." 
When they were known, Bob had trentacinque years. It was an enigmatic man, of first I lead off glacial. It entangled with indifference men and women. The first graces to his/her professional fancy out of the schemes and to the safety of every reasoning of his, while with the women the presence was enough. All depended on the attractiveness of his/her lines, together to a slender and well defined physicist from years of swimming, passion that anchors cultivated in the free moments. Hair was long, often enlivened by curves to read, also for its habit to let them dry without aid of the phon gadget that hated. To school it imprisoned them in a tail. The dark blond of the head of hair was prematurely ploughed by locks color silver, that you/they created pleasant reflexes. Dafne often lost him to stare at them. The alone gesture of discostare the rebellious locks from the face it distracted three quarters of class. The face was accattivante, delineated by definite lines, that appeared hard to first impact. But what above every thing captured of that man, it was the look; eyes of an indefinite clear color, between the grey one and the green, that to the solo to cross they penetrated them as a vice to the stomach. 
It was decidedly the classical teacher that all the girls would like to have. 
For Dafne, Bob possessed the intrigue of the artist. That looks incravattato and impeccable from perfect advertising it hid some other. It was certain of it. Despite this positive impression of his, their relationship in the classroom had been icy for a long time, as if to skin, despite the attractiveness of both, something didn't work. Reason for which, the debut of their history was everything anything else other than idyllic. In the first two months of school you/they were observed a lot, with moderate insistence. In spite of this, their looks were communicated distrust. The interventions of Dafne were monosyllabic, contrarily of the other girls that always found a pretext to hold back him/it and to speak to us. Every lesson was edged by thousand doubts and questions; they idolized him/it in way to a little shameless dir. He didn't escape to gentleness, for how much you measure and with due separation. According to Dafne that adoration authorized him/it to feel himself/herself/themselves one" strafigo." It was this the principal defect of the girl: to rush himself/herself/themselves in hasty judgments, often inconclusive. It was an unintentional form of self-defence; it is sure what, because of this attitude, it collected the worse figuracces of his/her life. 
Everything began with a nervous exchange of wisecracks, with which she silently clarified that you/he/she would not be made to put the feet it makes a will, even from the more the teachers' osannatos. 
Dafne had the free afternoon from the job, and definite to stop himself/herself/themselves in institute to cross again the last lesson in sight of the tests of November. Cohabiting with a cubist, the first hours of Friday afternoon they were not never optimal for the study, since the girl started in the living room trying his eccentric" choreographies." 
In that same moment Bob, checking his/her purse, it realized to have forgotten in the classroom the essential his/her Black-Barry. It returned back and it found with amazement his/her fleeinger student, concentratissima on some notes. 
«I warmly hope that they are my clipboard. You/he/she is crossing again them with such a devotion!» the man apparently began with serious air. 
Dafne looked at him/it bored, even though surprised to see to fall him/it in the classroom. 
«Devotion? And even to Christmas he/she wants a candle on the desk?» shoal responded, with air of challenge. 
«You excuse me, it was only a wisecrack. I have realized only that she is the only one on winds people that it understands indeed the sense of my lessons. But I see that to lunch you/he/she is not fed of good humor therefore. The wishes her good weekend.» 
It grabbed the telephone from the drawer of the desk and he/she immediately left the classroom. 
Dafne, for the first time, you/he/she had found bread for his/her teeth. Stunned, it felt not to have understood anything. Despite you/they were always snobbed, Roberto Chellini esteemed her/it heavily beating him/it to him in face. 
Not succeeding in waiting for Monday, the runs behind as a fury: 
«Waits! Ehm, aspects!» it said with the fiatone. 
«Any problem for the you; problems?» he/she asked with a half smile of whom had very appreciated the gesture, carefully disguised as an icy look. 
«In effects I have ended the good humor, does he/she offer some of it? He/she sees, the lesson that I crossed again was his. even The would take advantage to ask her burdens explanation of it. Appreciate him/it, because it doesn't happen me every day to repent me for what I say.» 
After these words Dafne had mentioned him a timid smile. 
«I would say to pass to a mutual" you." And then I add that in how much supreme God, will go down from my altar and I will forgive you. Better humor I would offer you a coffee. However I am holding two dogs to a friend that is found in the United States; they are closed in the house from the ten. You understand well that could find of everything if I don't race to make to go out them. You could make me company.» it tried him, even though certain to have dared too much burdens. 
Dafne had listened to him/it with interest, struck from how much that cold" I know everything self" pits to the hand and ready to the wisecrack. 
«It won't be inconvenient?» Dafne winked, beginning to take tastes us. 
«Yes, you/he/she could be him/it; but for a student that wants to make publicity the good humor it is fundamental. And then the other students are run away away. You know, it is Friday.» 
Of sudden it drew near her, so much to be made an intoxicating perfume feel her; its tone did him serious. 
«From Monday I will be away for a week and I would like to give you the explanations that serve you before the tests; I have the problem of the dogs, but later I would return to the idea of the coffee, if you want.» 
«What serious tone!» the bacchettò her «evidently we are in two not to understand the wisecracks. I wait out, next to the parchetto.» 
In car Dafne was nervous. It didn't understand what it embarrassed so much her. You/he/she had gotten used to manage whatever situation with everybody. But something for the first time did her/it feel inadequate. Despite the first initial provocations on her" unsuitability", Dafne would never have made of the serious avanceses to his/her teacher. It didn't leastly accept that this desire was able only also to graze her/it; you/he/she would have made the figure penosa of all the other girls of the institute. But then because it felt him very embarrassed? What were those the famous ones" butterflies to the stomach?" It tried to think about all other. But then it looked at him/it with the tail of the eye and he/she thought about having never seen anything of so beautiful; it held a hand on the steering wheel, while the left was brought in front of the mouth, the index slowly passing himself/herself/itself among the lips. That was for him an enough usual gesture, especially in the moments of concentration or embarrassment. Dafne observed his hands, taking advantage of the moments in which one of the two abandoned him on the change or it systematized the fan of the warm air. It had long fingers and well you model. Then, the nth and fast look to the profile of the face. To that point, in the head of Dafne, every certainty shattered him; it tried as uncontrollable so unacceptable feelings. And that figure to its left resembled more and more to the man of the dreams that waited from a life. It looked for of resettare every absurd thought with banal attempts of conversation. 
They arrived to his/her house. Dafne communicated the preference to wait in car. The teacher thought that you/he/she was better to accept without objections. Nevertheless, once made to go out the dogs in front of the quarter of house, it recrossed the courtyard and it drew near definite to the car, bending himself/herself/itself on the car window to speak to her. 
«I would like that I entered only a moment; I have something to show you.» 
To Dafne the heart made a leap. An amazing feeling, liquid joy in vein, a sense of confusion ever tried before. He/she didn't know as to tame those feelings anymore. Anything he wanted to show her, it was not important; what counted it is that you/he/she had not left her in car to wait. 
Once gone beyond the threshold, the girl flowed the most beautiful portraits that you/he/she had ever seen; they were numerous, suspended here and there in a small and modern openspace. Dafne was invaded by a sense of ferment. They were unreal. 
«They are mine» he/she explained Bob «the last one is that, I have done him three years ago.» 
Dafne was strabiliata, it simply found that extraordinary paintings, so much not to be succeeded in checking his/her excitement. 
«Then an advertising are not alone everything spot and computer! You won't believe it, but it has been since September that I observe you, that listening what says, word for word; your genius in the subject was clear but. The also perceived other, and The wases not wrong me. Everything this is fantastic, they are fantastic! Before every other thing are a painter! And you are.» 
Dafne stopped him in the attempt to look for the correct adjective that didn't make to slip out in shameless way his/her feelings. 
Bob nervously passed the hands among the hair; you/he/she loosened them, then you/he/she bound them of hurry. It seemed tense. It set the hands come in front of the mouth. They settled some instant, embarrassed, up to that he spoke. 
«And am I? What am I/you/they? Because you know, I only feel me a big coglione in this moment. because The would like to see you naked in my living room and to paint your curves on to white sheet. and The ams to coglione because I/you/they have not succeeded in not telling you him.» 
Dafne looked at him/it with shelled eyes, without succeeding in answering, completely unarmed. The breath was made strenuous. It was the first time that he/she didn't know whether to come out of it and it was already the third time that that man succeeded to spiazzarla. To anybody else teacher would already have thrown something I set; but with him you/he/she was invaded by a dangerous exciting shiver. Fought to the improbable one, definite that owed to make to be transported. Anything had left in that house escaping, you/he/she would have regretted him/it of sure. Dafne the jacket removed from him and began to softly unbutton himself/herself/themselves the shirt that bandaged her the delicate forms. It went on to undress himself/herself/themselves, staring at him/it with bewitching look, lost in his/her eyes, firm and magnetic. It hoped not to be interrupted, up to that he/she remained in underclothes. Bob had in front of itself a naked half girl that drew near him with extreme sensuality; a slender and seductive figure. The him approssimò with fear. Hardly it was her to few centimeters it felt the shaken breath of it. The neck caressed her, for then to make to flow the fingers along the shoulder, accompanying down the suspender of the bra. It continued, up to discover her/it completely. With definite gestures, but at the same time apprehensive, it conducted her/it toward the couch. To that point she succeeded in pronouncing an only sentence with the only thread of possible voice. 
«And would you like to withdraw me teacher only?» 
Bob the he hurled I set with energetic passion cutting her breath with an intense kiss and load of desire. And it was not some one desire had been being born for a few times. After that first contact, accompanied by the first moans, Bob was not afraid some anymore; Dafne would not have stopped him. They lost in uninhibited and exciting preliminary, to unite himself/herself/themselves in an intense, long enjoyment. While him the it stirred above with vigor, Dafne discovered then as everything the sex done before you/he/she had been bleak and deprived of emotion. 
It was late afternoon, when they panted together the last time. Bob grazed for a long time her hair, in that period of a meddler red fire as the passion that you/he/she had just upset them. The time seemed an useless and distant dimension. Only the dogs that complained food brought them to the reality. 



Speaking of the Christmas 2003 
They spent two months from that overwhelming first meeting. Hardly possible, Bob and Dafne made the love with to regulate passion and involvement. 
The school where Bob taught you/he/she was a private institute. Despite this its history with Dafne could not be made public, both were aware of it. He wanted to protect his/her ethics and to certainly protect her from a notoriety few orthodox. You, wanted only instead to protect the indisputable professionalism of his/her companion. If a thing of the kind was known, the envy of the advertising aspirants would have caused him enormous damages. Both, protected besides, a clean relationship and coinvolgente, that spiazzati had them to the sudden one. 
Often, during the courses, he brought the boys in the room computer. It assigned them numerous exercises, passing from the various postings to observe its carrying out. When Dafne saw him/it stoop himself/herself/themselves on the bench of other girls, it went crazy; it observed with disgust the faces ammiccanti of those shameless geese. This way it finished the lessons with a good dose of nervousness. Instead he was able of to maintain a cold indifference, that she didn't bear, although it understood her/it. 
Then the lessons ended and all hastily changed classroom, while Dafne tried for the most part of to temporize. Other times it raced in bath, for then to return back when all if n'erano already gone; to that point Bob was only finally, free to grant her a sincere look, desirous to speak to her, to graze her hair, to quickly strip her/it to make the love. All statement in a breve but intense look. 
In the free afternoons he took the fuoristrada and it gave to pick her/it up; they often found again him to one hundred kilometers of distance, without not even realizing of it. They looked for and they visited places that Dafne had never imagined to be able to see. In the last years, Bob was very impassioned of landscape photo; really thanks to this passion, you/he/she knew amazing places, often to few street times from the grey Milanese frenzy. 
It was in that period that Dafne purchased his/her reflex, remaining in disappointed hurry of it; to the beginning it was certain that you/he/she would have been able to do his every passion of Bob, then it realized that the love was not to dress some tastes of the other, how much rather to unconditionally love them, maintaining settles the proper ones. 
Bob and Dafne often spoke of their passions. He had told her to have stopped having been painting for years. It was one of the rare references that it did her speaking of his lived. Dafne knew a lot of his/her actual habits and of his/her profession; its job returned him a lot of satisfactions, both as teacher that as advisor and esteemed creative. It was often adjourned to the foreign countries for then to begin bright collaborations. 
But who was Bob besides a fascinating man of success? Dafne had already been realizing for the first weeks that he was not quite inclinable to share too many aspects of his/her past, or perhaps, of his/her life. 
During that first months you/they had succeeded in frequently enough seeing him; stripped by the suits of the teacher, it was a very sweet man. It treated her as if it tried a truth and reality feeling. This way, Dafne very, quickly began to wonder what pits this feeling. But the fear to speak was him of it bulky. It was too soon, and it feared to make the figure of the ragazzina, that already wants after few weeks" to define the relationship." Definite therefore not to make to race too much the mind, their relationship living day for day. You/he/she was never fallen in love before then, and of sure you/he/she was never approached to a true man, greater than her. At the same time it knew well the masculine universe: sets in front of taming of it but you and I. thing we macaws? it begins the absolute panic, generally follows from an escape without return. You/he/she could not take this risk; without counting that their history was subsequently complicated by the difference of age aspect that she feared more than every other thing. 
«Sooner or later it will make me the classical discorsetto: you are too much youth for me, worths to be with a contemporary, we have different demands, when I will have fifty of them you would have less twelve of it. bla, bla, bla. The feels him/it to me!» 
This told Dafne the cubist, an evening when you/he/she had lifted the elbow because of the paranoia; and the cubist had given her an unexpected pearl of wisdom. 
«I knew that you would have made a greater. You are not really the type from the twenty year-old half cartridges that I see in the disco on Saturdays. If is not stupid doesn't do you him the" discorsetto", will see! And where the ricapitas an intelligent gnocca as you?» 
Dafne thought that you/he/she would have found in thousands of it, because Bob was more every day the most beautiful thing that you/he/she had ever seen. That evening Dafne also thought that that cubist had to be a deeper girl of what the appearance you/he/she told. But by now it was for deepening its knowledge late; Dafne would have changed later house the week. To a price imperdibile had found an old studio apartment to the doors in Milan, where alone would finally have been. 
During that cold December, the life of Dafne quickly changed. You hated oltremisura to lose the control, and Bob was provoking her really this feeling; you/he/she was dependent more from that man every day. You/he/she had always sworn to herself that he would be never" rincretinita" for anybody, but by now the heart you/he/she had departed for his where irrational, as a marble that begins to cross the prophetic tilted plan. Dafne you have to surrender, beginning to stagger on his/her same convictions, induced more and more by the attitudes coinvolgenti of the man. 
When it moved, Bob made to jump some appointments and definite to make her a surprise. 
«Today I help you with the I move, we buy some Christmas decorations and tonight I stay me to sleep from you; and for the whole night I would propose to make the love among these!» 
Bob was showing her the blue sheets electric that had seen before together the week in a negozietto of I Lick. Dafne had not said anything, you/he/she had admired only her. It was maddish that he had gained him/it. The color of that appreciated cloth was intense and spine-chilling, as what tried at that time. He had given her the sheets where together, for the first time, you/they would have made the love in a house all his/her. It was December 20 th 2003. 
They spent the whole afternoon to make the love. Moans and sighs had still made echo for times among those bare boundaries. Bob looked at her/it with wonder, caressing her hair and consuming her/it of kisses. You were lost among his/her braccias. It observed the wide shoulders of it, the tapered hands, the long hair silvered that only in intimacy he/she saw loose. The Dafne child returned with overbearance, thinking that that figure pits of big long better than his/her preferred heroes. Despite all of his/her head he/she didn't succeed in not thinking about all the fears that had invaded her in the preceding days. 
«Because you don't paint Bob anymore?» 
Dafne felt to have asked the first question that the most intimate side of that man could disclose her, desirous to do departs more concretely of it. 
«Be', every painter ago his/her time, Daf.» 
A kiss stamped her on the lips. You immediately gained the attempt of instant escape from the matter. 
«But what answer is it? You are an unbelievable painter, and it seems that you have stopped giving him importance.» 
Dafne he was visibly shaking, escaping further caresses, more interested to deepen the discourse. 
«You are the conceitedness person!» it sentenced him behind a bitterness smile. 
«And me known that you, oddly, continuous not to answer. After all go in bed from some, and I hardly know where live! Of thing I surprise me?!» it beat annoyed, immediately repenting himself/herself/itself. 
«Then it is this the problem. Let's put her/it so Dafne: I don't paint because simply I now do something more productive. Second thing, is here in two to go together in bed, and I has never forced you. Now, if you don't regret it, I go out to take something to eat.» 
Bob dressed and did for going out, but Dafne cooled him/it on the threshold. 
«Let's put her/it so teacher, returns to eat to your house. You don't do me any favor to be around me, and I would not like that I/you had put in head the contrary one.» 
«No, I have not put in really void head, I hope for you is sure of the things that you say.» 
«I am him/it Bob» Dafne responded, abruptly incaponita to have the best. 
«Well» it replied him. 
The man left the apartment followed by a veil of sadness that Dafne didn't perceive. You/he/she was imposed to hold the low look up to the complete closing of the door, some that crossing the look of it, you/he/she would have returned on his/her footsteps. 
The epilogue of the most beautiful day of its life had been devastante; in few wisecracks, you/he/she had told him all of this for which was intended to take time. On the other hand you/he/she had not felt anything encouraging; a fleeing man that didn't open to a true knowledge. It suffered a lot seeing to go away it, but for pride it didn't stop him/it. Dafne was already in love perdutamente of Bob but that day, despite the thousand tears, it held it settles his/her famous stubbornness. He/she didn't want to allow that feeling to cloud entirely her. This is what he/she thought that evening. The following days and the Christmas 2003, were instead a test hard and unprecedented. After that quarrel, Bob disappeared in the nothing. Initially Dafne was worried few; you/he/she was unconsciously excited by their first quarrel, already projected to an evening of little darlings and unbridled sex that you/he/she would have reconciled them. Then, not feeling him/it for days, it began to be afraid. The fear he made not terror as soon as it realized that its jail cell was out to every time. You cursed for not having him ever asked the number of the second jail cell. On that of the job they called him/it at least fifty times a day, you/he/she would certainly have found him/it power on. 
A fourth day it placed him in front of his/her house, hoping to perceive the arrival of the fuoristrada from a moment to the other. It didn't have references anybody that could help her/it. From the desperation he/she called the reception office of the school, but it was insane to find someone the day of the eve. And then thing would have asked? What would you/he/she be invented for looking for news? Also finding someone, you/they would never have given her personal information on a teacher. 
At eight o'clock in the evening Dafne left that accursed courtyard, it climbed on the grungy utilitarian bordeaux and it passed from his/her parents, to inform them that you/he/she would not have had lunch with them to Christmas. 
At two o'clock in the afternoon of December 26 you/he/she had received an invitation from some old friends of the high school, that cannot wait to wriggle out himself/herself/themselves from the meaningless herd of relatives that you/they invaded house during the parties. Dafne had cried the whole night among the sheets of blue satin, that accursed perfume of Bob it didn't give her truce. You dressed and it accepted the invitation of the ex companions. Alone you/he/she would have risked the madness. 
After the appetizer, lasted a couple of hours, the rebellious party continued to house of James, a native boy of London that had frequented part of the first year of high school with Dafne for then to retire himself/herself/themselves and to make the spool between Italy and England. 
James in that period would have given an arm to go out with Dafne, and you/he/she was very excited to the idea to see her/it again. You that evening had not even recognized him/it. It did a lot of work to remember himself/herself/themselves to have been his/her classmate, considered that when James united to the gang, she had already swallowed three heavy cocktails. 
James had been reentering for two months, and this time you/he/she had taken house and found a job semifisso as barman, even if its more consistent entrances arrived from other turns. It was a ragazzone from the reddish hair sprinkled of gel, a freckled and physical nose from player of retired rugby, of those that tracannano beer from morning to evening. In the last period it divided the apartment with two boys of the south, that had returned from the families for the parties. The house had carefully been furnished of every type of super alcoholic, at ten o'clock in the evening they were all completely you intoxicate. Dafne had warmingly been invited by a pair of friends to avoid the alcoholic party of the English, but the girl had not wanted to feel reasons doing of his/her head. Dafne never lost completely the control but that evening the head didn't respond and the heart hurt her; Bob ever missed not her as, you/he/she had not even called her for the wishes of Christmas, you/he/she had abandoned her. You/he/she could not accept that that man had taken the first useful pretext to send her/it to that country. Dipped in those paranoias, you/he/she was found again in the middle of about ten strangers to house of an English of which it kept on hardly remembering himself/herself/themselves. You/he/she had smoked anything you/he/she was passed among her hands and, after the last sip of humanly tolerable vodka, it estranged him from the group to the search of the bath. Found the door it lost the balance and it tumbled to earth, to few centimeters from the bathtub. When it reopened the eyes, he/she hardly remembered to be fallen. Despite it was stunned from the blow and from the alcohol, it indiscriminately felt the presence of someone: it was James, that tried to unthread her pantyhoses while already the breast semiscoperto touched her panting as a pig. 
Realized the all, Dafne it began to insult him/it and to strike anywhere, in the attempt to wriggle out himself/herself/themselves and to cover himself/herself/themselves; it seemed a crazy person, so much that the boy ran away instantly away, insulting her/it. 
Dafne was alone again, it felt him not to have a lot of strengths to rise again himself/herself/themselves; you/he/she had used the last to strike and to curse that hog. He/she heard a strange silence originate from the stay. The party had to be ends from some. You looked I set and realize to still wear the brief. Thanks to the sky James was too much drunk to succeed in stripping her/it with promptness. 
With movements it got up and it did for looking at himself/herself/themselves to the mirror. James reopened the door and the jacket threw her I set: 
«Here you have remained, only but considering that you do the difficult one you can go.» 
Dafne threw him I set a saponetta and it escaped away. You literally dragged to the car and it waited to the cold to be under the conditions to arrive to uninjured house. It was furious as a beast with that accursed English, but you/he/she had become rabid above all with herself. It thanked the sky to have wakened up in time. You/he/she had taken an enormous risk. 
Despite this, its head was not assembled only on that accident; it was badly for Bob. Turned on the car and it departed, crying. 
What had happened to his/her heart? As you/he/she had been able to lose the control to that way? Dafne had always detested his/her old companions that had lived the adolescence to torment himself/herself/themselves and to humble himself/herself/themselves for some beautiful boy. You/he/she had lived different relationships, but the heart had never been involved of it. You/he/she had been indeed perhaps a choice, or you/he/she had been only fortune. In that years you/they had often called her" he/she eats men", for the facility with which you/he/she was courted, despite the a little elegant style. Now it was her to make himself/herself/themselves the famous mental saws, it was her to have known the famous loving torment, and it was her that a suffering to forget you/he/she had risked to make sex from fainted with the filthiest of the individuals. 
Reaches house it didn't make a big parking lot, but how much less you/he/she had arrived whole. Once inside, it removed him the suits and runs from to wash him with hot water. It washed twice the teeth and it made big quantities of gargles to attenuate the taste of the alcohol. You surprised of as you/he/she had not vomited the soul. Later it realized only that he/she had not adequately eaten for three days. In the house it didn't have anything, correct some slice biscottata, of the tuna and some milk. Its instinct of survival complained later food but the day you/he/she would have worked only eight hours to the business center and the thought it made her forget the hunger. It aimed the alarm clock and it collapsed exhausted in a deep sleep, I don't deprive of nightmares. 
At seven o'clock in the evening of the day later, Dafne ended his/her turn. There had not been a lot of job, immediately after the Christmas it was always this way. Jessica, his/her person responsible to the department perfumes, you/he/she had made her find an envelope floods of creams and campioncini: 
«So much stuff is advanced this year, these I have left them for you; and sees your wax of today, they will serve you!» it said smiling. 
Dafne, in the last years, you/he/she had not given a lot of space to the friendships. Few people had transmitted her that trust of which it had need, and after the high school you/he/she had lost her for road. It was not interested to the thousand acquaintances to be able to call for an evening, few people you/they would have been enough for her, but sincere. In that situation, it regretted bitterly the loneliness; it was departed by now a week from the disappearance of Bob, and she didn't have anybody with which to relieve himself/herself/themselves. This way, when Jessica the churches the why of that does dejected, Dafne bursted in a desperate and uncontrollable weeping. 
The girl passed her a pair of handkerchiefs and a spaghettata proposed her to speak some. Dafne thought that that proposal pits a manna from the sky. 
After the supper it told of Bob, of as everything you/he/she had been born, of as him you/he/she had planted her in ace for the Christmas, and of the thousand doubts that made her burst the head. 
Jessica was very precise and sincere in to give his/her first impression. It was graduated in psychology, and this gave her an analytical and authoritative way in to furnish his/her own point of view. 
«It seems me evident that to your first taking of position this Bob is felt envoy with the shoulders to the wall; typical of many men with low autostima. And usually the escape is from manual. But you feel, allow me the frankness. Is you/he/she gotten married? Divorcé?» 
Dafne looked at her/it with confused air. 
«Is really this the point! I don't know anything! Nothing of nothing! I hoped that with to spend some weeks he/she spoke to me of itself, as I had done me. After two months I have desired to deepen our relationship to know more something. But you/he/she has appeared fleeing, and I believe that I/you/he/she am for the fact that doesn't want a true history. However I don't believe is gotten married. We were very often together, and he works so much indeed. When you/he/she would have had time for his/her/their wife?» 
Dafne nervously touched him his/her thousand bracelets, annoyed that he was able only also to think about a wife. 
«I don't know well you Dafne, and this perhaps helps me to have the maximum purity and objectivity; even if you/he/she was not gotten married, thing that believe me, would not absolutely exclude, I don't believe that Bob is trying what tries you. You it is evident you love him/it to the folly and you would like a concrete love story, and it is sacrosanto to your age. He doesn't have the same purpose, evidently. That's why it doesn't find sensible to speak to you of his/her things. He doesn't leave the beloved person to the first quarrel, not to Christmas and not in this way. Do you understand what I want to tell you?» 
The eyes of Dafne again dampened him; unequivocal sign that the words of the girl had struck her in full. Those just felt, were the doubts that had flooded her the brain from the principle, and someone had now beaten heavily them to him in face. 
«He/she wanted only to sweep, according to you?» he/she asked with suffering, before it went down her the nth one, sharp tear. 
«I believe that you are very beautiful, of a very rare vitality Dafne. Any man would be lost the occasion.» 
«But I there was!» howled Dafne lifting himself/herself/itself standing «there was when looked at there in class, when has desired me the first time, in the afternoons together! Let's have in common a world of things, acknowledged thing I looked for then making me a gift! Am I immediately me granted, and have we been going for two months in bed, because you/he/she would have had to make the whole rest of the teatrino?» 
«Because many men like it really this, Dafne. When they want some pure sex they go from the puttanes. But appagante is very more to do him/it with a woman in love perdutamente. And therefore they feed the falling in love, also without wanting him/it. Without forgetting the classical game hunter and prey, for then to boast around himself/herself/themselves some conquest. Do you know that honor to display to friends and colleagues the nth adventure with a student? Let's intend us Dafne, I wish indeed me that I/you/he/she am not the case of this Bob. But you are careful, certain men know how to be very scanty at times. And you parts handicapped, because you are not comparing yourself with a contemporary, but with a done man and ended.» 
«All absurd Jessica seems me» bofonchiò Dafne. 
«I have only a few years in more than you, but I have passed so many of it to be able to write us a book. And psychology is alone to the dawns to know indeed the universe of certain heads.» 
The second cup of American coffee poured her. 
«I didn't believe that you/he/she would have given me an I love you to Christmas; however I hoped it told me that we were a couple, that ended my third year we would have been able to go out to supper with his/her colleagues, it stuffed to see to the light of the sun, or even to introduce me to the family. I believed it tried something great despite the little time together. Instead I am afraid now to be done me of the nonexistent films.» 
It sipped his/her coffee, thinking that in his/her life you/he/she had not been so badly never. 
Dafne talked a lot to Jessica. After having dismissed the loving matter, the two girls realized to have in common a lot of things, among which the reluctance in to deepen too friendships and the loneliness that it at times tormented her. They intended to see him other times and to make shopping together after the parties; they fully arranged on the fact that the sales could make miracles, even in the worse moments. At eleven and half o'clock, Dafne wore his/her coat in violet velvet and dismissed him with a smile. 
All could imagine, but not that someone the same ones waiting out for house, sat on the sidewalks, in an icy night of end December. And you/he/she would ever have believed that that someone could be Bob. And instead he was there, wound in a black montgomery, with the long loosened hair, dampened by the cold to attend her/it. You was blowing in the hands, in the attempt to get warm himself/herself/themselves. It flowed the auto of Dafne and it lifted the look without stirring. You gone down by the car, and as soon as he/she saw him/it it was paralysed, as if a blade cools the same ones cutting the body, as if the heart had decided to squirt street from her breast. He/she didn't succeed in breathing. After a handful of seconds it stepped backwards, as to return to the auto; it did him/it up to beat us against with the back. You turned and it tried to open to run away away her. It trembled from the cold, it trembled from the anger, he/she didn't succeed in inserting that accursed key. He grabbed him from behind and before she could say anything, the hand gently leaned on her lips. With the other arm it encircled her life, crushing her/it to itself. 
«There is something that you have to know Daf. I pray you, it waits.» 
After a principle of rebellion, Dafne returned immovable, as to the beginning. It didn't feel colder; it was again, suddenly, among his/her braccias and it was as if everything the love that tried for that man the same flowing hot in the veins, fast. You turned and a long instant looked at him/it. You/he/she would have slapped him/it, you/he/she would have kissed him/it, it was everything conflicting; head and heart were fighting to the last blood. He was clearly infreddolito. Dafne him made account that had to have for a long time her expected. The heart had the best. That glacial and deep eyes had looked at her with supplication, bewitching her as every time. 
«It will be the case that you climb to take you a warm shower» it told her a vain attempt of indifference. 
They climbed in the house, Dafne delivered him a clean bathrobe. He had not said before still anything from the and only sentence whispered next to the car. You the same. 
Mezz'ora after Bob went out of the bath, still wound in the bathrobe with the damp hair; they were always very I just moved washed, with such a perfume to be invaded the room, whatever pits the product used for washing them. In to so damnedly see him/it beautiful, Dafne it labored not few to show him indifference. The heart beat madly her. 
«Because you have left here me to torment me as a crazy person?» churches her, breaking the ice that separated them. 
You/he/she had just murdered his/her pride with that sentence. But it needed immediate clarity. 
«Domenica, on that bed, you have succeeded in asking me the only question that could devastate me. You don't even imagine how much. Then you have cooled me, sending me street.» 
Dafne tried to intervene but Bob stopped her/it session stante. 
«No, I pray you, make to end me. I don't know what you think indeed of me. But that afternoon you have made me feel the classical stupid that sweeps with whatever understands ragazzina him under draught. I have had thousand occasions but not the you ever concretize once. I wanted you. If you believe in this, then I can finally give you the answers that you look for.» 
Dafne lowered the head, gesture that Bob interpreted as affirmative. 
«Then you still want to know, why don't I paint anymore and do I arrive from where?» 
Dafne returned to look at him/it, brim as a rope of violin. It was frightened to the idea of thing you/he/she would have felt. At the same time it felt strong the emotion for the sweetness felt a little before; he had realized every doubt of his and you/he/she had made her feel important. It was not one of the so many, it was not the one month-old adventure; you/he/she would not have lasted however perhaps, but of sure its feelings were correct and Jessica was mistaken. 
«I believe you. I would like to feel what you want to tell me. but take to seat nearby here, first» it said her with timidity. 
It was nearby hardly her, Dafne moved his damp hair from the face bringing them behind the ears; it passed his/her thin fingers on his/her uncultivated beard, then on the lips. They were about to do the one be crushed by the other, but they stopped him. It was time to listen what Bob had to say. 
«You have it foresees the picture to the entry? I had told you that that had been the last, painting three years ago.» 
«The extended woman on the bed.» bofonchiò voice low Dafne. 
«Really that» it clarified him. 
Dafne made local mind and tried to remember every detail of it; the body was of an extended woman on a bed, whose sensual forms were bandaged in a sheet. The colors of that painting were warm, fiabeschi for Dafne. The girl him made account that had always analyzed him from an artistic point of view, but it was not never mail the problem of who pits the owner of that fantastic body. Bob seemed to read her in the thought and continued his/her story: 
«That on the bed has been being Vanessa, my wife and great love of my life for the times of the university.» 
Dafne made a leap bringing himself/herself/itself on the other side of the room. 
«You have to make Daf end me, or I won't make her/it more to continue. I pray you listen to me!» 
Dafne was petrified, invaded by a prickle that it prevented her from feeling the body. Bob respected his/her separation and kept on telling. 
«I have lived in Pisa for five years. I arrived from Siena, where I/you/they were born and grown. I was nineteen years old when I moved me, it was the ottantasette; I went art to the university, and there I knew Vanessa. I met her during a lesson; it was the model that we would have withdrawn. They were all to the seventh sky, instead I was annoyed to the thought that such a young and beautiful girl appeared naked to about ten idiots.» 
Bob fixed the void, as him same reliving that scene projected in air, while Dafne made him jump away all I enamel him/it violet from the fingernails. 
«I don't do you her long. after one month Vanessa and The frequenteds there and in the novantaquattro we married there. You wanted to move himself/herself/themselves to Milan. Definite that was the best thing, because I wanted to realize me in my field and to show her how much I was worth. You organized events. From the life we wanted only the maximum one.» 
Listened to this last affirmation Dafne it brusquely interrupted him/it. 
«You could save me the details on your life of success? Do you go to the firm Bob, where is this Vanessa? And that enter it me in your perfect life of the cazzo?» 
The tears invaded her the disturbed face. It tried to hold back her, but it was her impossible. He remained where it was, passing himself/herself/itself the hands on the face and then among the hair. It was uneasy in serious difficulty. Attended once that to Dafne it seemed endless. 
«Vanessa is dead» it declared Bob with peaceful coldness «it is dead in the novantanove, after two years of pain and suffering. two years to be forgotten.» 
Bob's eyes, for the first time, they were done shiny, even if it tried to have self-control himself/herself/themselves with strength, to succeed in going on. 
«And that of her on the bed is the last portrait that I have done her. Later I have sworn to myself, that I would not have withdrawn anymore.» 
Dafne could not say anything. The breath the it stopped him in throat, as if the bellows had torn her from the breast and its blood you/he/she was stopped. It tried conflicting feelings. You cursed for the things that you/he/she had said a little before. You/he/she would have sunk gladly, very in low. 
He gathered everything this, thanks to the empathy that had immediately tied them from. It got up and it went nearby her, it leaned his/her forehead against that of the girl holding her head among the hands. 
«After you/he/she has disappeared from my life I have spent years of hell. Years full of job, loneliness, trips to the foreign countries, all in the attempt not to grant time to the pain. Then you have arrived and. The have tried unbelievable things. I have been afraid, fear to try something of strong. But you missed me, and I had to return from you, to tell you thing I brought me inside and to be able to finally restart.» 
Dafne was esterrefatta; you/he/she had listened to very strong things in the good and in the evil. But an only sentence now boomed her in head: it was him missed and he/she wanted to restart. 
«I don't want to know other, neither on his/her death neither on what you have passed. You will speak only of it when you will want to do him/it. I regret for your wife, I feel me a disgust for this. I could not know. but at the same time The ams happy. Felice because also I want to restart. Rather, to start, with you.» 
Two nobody could know as you/he/she would have gone, or for how much that prophetic desire would have lasted to live him. But they understood in hurry thing an instant you/he/she would be happened later; I still invaded by a strong disturbance they melted him in a kiss, between the tremor and the trepidation to belong anchors him. In an instant they were an alone thing, with a passion that only love and pain together could produce. 



Speaking of the summer 2004 
In May 2004 Dafne finished the course post he/she graduates. As it tries final, among the other tests, you/he/she would have had to prepare a small promotional country for a fictitious product of beauty. You/he/she had been a hard job, but you/he/she had drawn results discreet of it. Bob had been her of great help, kind on the most technical part, for which Dafne had an innate and unbelievable reluctance. 
The things among them were all right. Five months had been passing for that cold night when Bob had told her fast lines of his/her past history. Dafne had not felt his yet I love you, but he/she knew that for this it didn't have to make pressures; in December you/he/she had learned the lesson, both with him and with herself. Bob had labored to accept the idea of a new relationship, despite you/he/she had desire of it and need. Beginning the history with Dafne, it was as if you/he/she had finally told goodbye Vanessa and the senses of guilt, of this the girl was convinced. For Bob to express this feeling to words would have been another footstep, that she would have attended with patience. Dafne had tried to tell him that it loved him/it, but every time he stopped, fearing that he felt him in embarrassment or forced to return him the affirmation. This way, in different occasions, you/he/she had left him some post-its on the refrigerator or in the purse, so that Bob he/she read the I love you in his/her absence. 
The relationship satisfied them immensely, and the end of the school had removed from them the duty of the relationship teacher-discente. The only embarrassment for Dafne his/her parents stayed. To the moment he/she preferred that they didn't know anything; the comparison with their dull and conservative mentality would again have devastated her, and it didn't intend to make himself/herself/themselves ruin the most beautiful moment of its life. 
After a first experience of stage during the last quarter, Dafne was not quite convinced that its professional future could be the same of its companion. It loved to create publicity, but it hated the environment of job of the creative ones. You/he/she had realized from immediately that it dealt with a tub full of sharks, in which the wickedness and the envy reigned sovereign. It held a work in which, also thanks to Bob, you/he/she would have been able to excel and to insert him without problems, yet he/she didn't want to take advantage him of it because of his/her stubborn character. Or at least not at that time. 
The summer of 2004 was for her a binomial of happiness and frenzy; it was the first summer with the man of its dreams. But it was also time to look for a new job. Definite that his/her searches you/he/she would have addressed within the fumettistica and the manual sketch, even as storyboard artist, trying to remain in the field of the publicity bringing forth his/her passion. It hoped that the era of the personal computer had not killed entirely its expectations. Announce him in field of illustration they were not certain to his/her favor, and when its curriculum roused them you/he/she was discarded pre-emptive for scarce experience. All of this that opened her before was the possibility of free stage, that could not afford. 
«Accursed! You/they have not even asked me to see my sketches, they don't even know thing I know how to do and they discard me!» it howled a morning to relieve himself/herself/themselves to the nth one" we will make her know." 
Bob was not enthusiastic at all of that situation, and you/he/she was still it less when Dafne fixed an interview in an art cafe, not very distant from the zone of Brera. 
«Must be goes crazy Daf! How can you leave a place that doesn't satisfy yourself in perfumery to choose even more another useless of it? Without counting that the maid to do will hock you in more irregular schedules. Have you studied three years to end in a cafe indeed?» 
«Bob I don't know him/it! After the stage in spring I have understood that in that place of fighette I could never survive. This cafe not a lot of dista from Brera and you/he/she could get you hook me for what I want to do really. Of sure many more in comparison to a perfumery. It is in the meantime draught on some penny» he/she explained her some bothered by that fatherly attitude of Bob. 
«Daf, will waste only precious time, that you should invest from immediately to have experience in graphic and advertising field; it is a frantic world with notions and programs that change of month in month. If cut out yourself, when will finally return in you will have to restart afresh everything! We are in the 2004 Daf, Rafael and Michelangelo they would starve a today's day.» it replied Bob, that with the provocative last affirmation, it turned Dafne into to fury. 
«Indeed I don't understand you! You are a painter an artist! Should spur my true road to follow me and would have had to also do him/it you! You seem my father instead. As you have been able to allow the publicity to make the art set aside you? Indeed I don't understand!» 
The two included in hurry that with that discourses you/they would not have arrived from any part, risking only the to feed divergences, due to the different age, to the lived one and above all to the fact that Dafne reasoned of belly, while Bob was extremely rational. They silently decided that they would not have of it more done motive for discussion, giving priority to the beautiful one that that history gave them on the emotional plan. 
To end June Dafne left the job in the business center to begin to work to the art cafe. 
The owner, a thirty year-old man, was a playful and available type, despite of first impression was set in scorbutic way. You/he/she had tried the colpaccio of the activity thanks to a small fortune inherited by the grandparent. It called Alberto Moristani, but for the friends it was alone and exclusively Moris. It was of origin valance but the smell for the business, as for the beautiful life, you/they had conducted him/it to Milan. Someone Bruce also called him/it, for the vague similarity that tied him/it to a famous actor, especially in as for muscles, lack hair and dark look to the Die Hard. Its life was devoted to the fun. "It needs to work for living, not to live for working, and when he works it needs to have a good time him." This was his/her witticism. 
Seen the attractive aspect, the women were not never him missed; despite this, with anybody you/he/she had ever concretized a true history. It was an irresistible free spirit with the whole intention to remain us. 
To the interview with Dafne, Moris asked how come a titled artist was satisfied with to serve in a cafe. The answer impudent and little pander of Dafne brought him/it to immediately assume her/it. 
«I don't know thing to do yet from great, but of sure I have floods of it the boxes to sell perfumes in center. Alone the lease is not paid. And then you could expose some painting of mine in your cafe and me I could add to the curriculum that I have participated in numerous shows in the zone Brera. What do you say, am I enough motivated?» 
The two immediately entered tuning, and this allowed Dafne immediately to advance some application for the schedules of job. 
You/he/she had negotiated for two only evenings a week, guaranteeing opening and appetizers for the rest of the business days. Fortunately in the weekend the team was already to the suit, therefore Dafne succeeded in seeing more regularly Bob the possible. 
The job in the cafe was of big long more appropriate to a whimsical person as Dafne. In that place it finally felt him to his/her ease. Besides being pleasant, you/he/she was frequented by people of all the types, from the boys fashion victim of the appetizer of Friday evening, to the alternative ones of district parties to the art in all of his/her expressions. Moris organized numerous events giving space to emergent artists of every type. For Dafne that cafes it was the ideal place to look for hookups; for Bob, it was the worse place in which his/her girl could waste time. Besides the professional side, the idea of that change instigated in him a sudden jealousy. The perfumery gave little opportunity to masculine meetings, while the counter of a cafe was an I bring of sea, and his/her Daf was too much provocative and suddenly sociable to pass unnoticed. Bob had never believed that the difference of age was a threat, but in that period the idea that numerous contemporaries could approach began her/it to shake him/it. 
It revealed these thoughts for the first time, a warm night in summer. To the cafe an evening had been devoted to July four, proposing him/it American style, with tasting of typical dishes and the exposure of pictures of pop arts. 
Bob reached of surprise eleven and half o'clock. To his/her entry it found Dafne that toasted with a boy aldilà of the counter. The type, around twenty-five years of age, to his/her notice you/he/she was looking everywhere at her except in the eyes. 
Dafne hardly him/it on the door, with great exultation it made him sign to draw near. Bob, for all answer, it made back march and it returned home, leaving that Dafne completed the evening in the most total tension. 
Closed the cafe, it immediately went him to his/her house, nonchalant of the time. It stuck to the bell with the intent to wake up him/it, for then to understand that Bob didn't sleep at all. He/she heard his/her near voice, probably in saloon, that he/she invited her/it to do from itself; the door was open. Dafne found him/it sat to the feet of the couch. He/she wore only a pant of the overall and you/he/she had picked up the hair in a chignon. The television was power on, it transmitted to low volume the second time of a dvd that Bob for years you/he/she had devoured: The Crow of Alex Proyas. Dafne didn't believe in his/her eyes; Bob was drawing. It kept on doing him/it, despite her falls in the house in way rocambolesco. The initial desire to attack diminished him/it in an instant. It was amazed. You/he/she could imagine all but not that show. His/her man had taken back in hand his/her greatest passion. 
«God Bob, is stupendous.» you/he/she said with sweetness. 
«You have not even seen him» Bob coldly answered, without tearing off the eyes from the sheet. 
«The sketch will be certainly it, but me. The reporteds me to you. It is stupendous what I see, what you are doing, you.» 
The emotion cut her the voice, making her/it thin and almost imperceptible. At times, and especially in that moment, Dafne labored to become himself/herself/themselves account that that man so much accattivante and beautiful to remove the breath it was his. 
«You come to see then» he/she invited her/it him. 
Dafne allowed to fall the purse on the couch and bent him on the knees, to see better. He/she saw herself. The profile of its face looked downward, loose hair seemed I moved by the wind. The hand of man touched her neck winding him/it completely. It seemed that that few simple lines of carboncino spoke to her. 
«When I/you/they have entered to the cafe and I have seen you drink with that type I have not understood anything anymore; I know that it is yours to have to be kind, but that guy slobbered you I set. I feel me a stupid fifteen-year-old. but only The Khans look you I know, because The love you and.» 
Bob didn't continue. You/he/she had told him. An instant after having done him/it her looked in the eyes, in penetrating way, entirely lost. Dafne brought him the hands to the mouth, with the whole emotion that only that very attended I love you you/he/she could provoke. He/she kissed him/it with passion and transport, returning him about ten of I love you in the few instants of breath that that kisses left. They made the love. You/he/she had always been overwhelming, but that evening two nobody could imagine of better. To the four of the morning their exhausted and sweaty bodies slept the one on the other, I moved only by their breath. A little far it lay immovable, the first portrait that Bob did to Dafne. 
For the last week of August, he gave her their first vacation together: a trip to Santorini, an island that both saw for the first time and that he/she left them to little dir estasiati. Bob, a third day, you/he/she had already gone off around three hundred photo, she had made a squirt to pencil of the fabulous landscape; once in house you/he/she would have created a painting on cloth. 
That place was for them a heaven. You/they were really freed by every thought, from the fearless traffic of the metropolis, from the discussions on the job, from the jealousies, and from all of this that was not love and passion. They desired continuously. Dafne provoked him/it to every occasion and, as two eighteen year-old to the first experience, they hid him from some part and they were loved, regardless of everything and all, excited by the incessant shiver of those situations. 
This also happened to the last evening of vacation, while they were walking along the waterline. The sea was black, absorbed in a night without moon; more than to see him to it succeeded in feeling its odor and to listen to of it the endless rustle. In distance a river of people still slipped for the illuminated road flood of English that sipped the nth beer in the small cafes. Looking more on, so many lower case letters lights identified the residences of that island, that harmoniously climbed on the body of the old volcano. Dafne looked at estasiata that nighttime landscape. You still felt the buzz of the people for road, when he lifted her the suit. They used that bed of dark sand for their last love-filled night to Santorini. 



Speaking of dreams and reality 
The summer pleasantly ended. 
The autumn consumed him fast, and Dafne had not found a job that pushed indeed her to leave the cafe yet. Thanks to that place, as from her expectation, had happened often to receive some errands for deprived portraits or to fresco some locations. Also the modern presses, with that little that was granted to the computer, they came very well her. To beginning November a friend of Moris, owner of a studio, had contacted her to decorate a location of next inauguration. When the man saw that the girl also had inventiveness and preparation in advertising field, you/he/she gave her white paper for the ideation of poster and invitations. Dafne didn't believe in his/her eyes, when it began to perceive the poster for the center in Milan. It was a feeling appagante; they were not the accustomed to ones few people to see his/her job. This time the whole city he passed of hand in hand his/her ideas. Bob was perhaps right, that circle could be stimulating indeed. 
Dafne was full of expectations; the constant presence of his/her man, the first professional occasions, the relationship with his/her/their parents more extended. All made her presage a 2005 exceptional. 
The love story with Bob consolidated more him every day; the vacation in Greece had been the best position that you/they could give him. They fed the one of the other with extreme and increasing empathy. The passion was the invisible thread that united them, irreversibly. That perception of tuning seemed had been proving for every single day, and Dafne the young student didn't feel him anymore in nanny of the most beautiful teacher of the world. It felt more and more to belong him, to be his/her woman that that had succeeded in making to fall again it in the unpredictable game unreal called love after years. 
You/he/she had sometimes happened her to pass to pick up Bob from some evening of job or from some agency with which it collaborated. And it often scrutinized the colleagues with which he entertained for a regard or for a last working comparison. They seemed trentenni done with I stamp him/it, and that unfortunately seen with the eye of a mature man, you/he/she could be indeed a perfect die. You/they were wound in minute suits of tall tailoring, often with heel ten and tied up hair in impeccable way; nothing was left to the case. What Dafne observed with greater trouble, it was as those women they were always a lot of ammiccanti with Bob. They were sure of themselves, as if for them pits everything already writing and evident; women of success that had understood as it turns the world. In that instants of extreme mental masochism, Dafne looked at the image of herself returned by the small mirror of the car. What devil did it make us Roberto Chellini with one this way? What would you/he/she have done from great to be indeed to his/her height? For how long would you/he/she have been satisfied with the alternative girl that paints well and with which ago the love in overwhelming way? But, punctually, him saliva in car and it looked her/it as you/he/she had been the first woman it approves up to that instant. To the times its look was so intense that communicated her to be the only woman on the planet. And the restlessness that upset her/it as snow were dispersed to the sun. 
Despite the continuous confirmations of his/her man, Dafne often had more and more the feeling that Bob shared too much with her few of his lived. It was as if he didn't have history and past. Star saw well it with her, but you/he/she withdrew him to every question on his/her old life. 
His/her parents and his/her only brother lived in Tuscany, this was the only thing that Dafne knew. Bob never saw them. Thinking well of us, Dafne didn't even have him/it ever felt us speak on the phone. Its jail cell rang only and entirely for job or for evenings with friends and collaborators. 
A privacy or the privacy of Bob it didn't exist it was something that Dafne could not share with him? And if the last hypothesis had been true, as you/they would have been able to consider indeed him a couple? When these thoughts came her, the sense of guilt with which it subsequently made the accounts was logorante. After the discovery of Vanessa, to investigate was too much painful. You had already doubted of him to the beginnings, making the figure more penosas of his/her life. Perhaps the relationship with his/her/their parents was not idyllic, or probably they was high-ranked and he didn't want to talk him of a history to a girl so more youth without art neither part. Everything could be. After all, also she had not shared his/her love story with his/her/their parents yet, despite they lived to alone ten minutes from there. Dafne tried to be confident, sooner or later he would be confided, exactly as you/he/she had done her. Their characters were different entirely, and she had to do him of it a reason. 
Between happiness and paranoias it arrived again December; for the two it was time of first recurrences. 
Bob and Dafne had discussed more times to establish the day of beginning of their history. He was inclinable to choose the day when you/they made the love the first time, she didn't agree. He/she didn't want but the horrible period of his/her disappearance of the preceding Christmas it belonged to their official history. This way, an evening of beginning December, they were found to discuss once more of it: 
«I would like to cancel the Christmas flowed by my memory Bob. The don'ts want that belong to the memoirs of our official history! The date of beginning is that in which you have told me of Vanessa. When have you returned from me after that horrible days.» before continuing it drew near him, with to serves as dead cat «and then, gives you remember yourself how many times you have made me enjoy that night? I pray you, tell me that will be that the date in which will celebrate the anniversary! Eh?» 
«Princess goes, is all right for December 27» concluded he, stunned by those avanceses. 
«However I remember everything of that night, every single moment. as The remember everything burdens first time, of my pathetic scenes to confess you my forbidden desire, of as you had gotten away the suits, than courage I/you had had in to I give him/it. All Daf, I always remember all.» 
Resolved the matter of the date, Bob stopped her the wrists with delicate violence; then with a hand you/he/she began to go under her to the skirt of violet velvet. The smile and the look ammiccantes that had in that moments, were something that according to Dafne nessun'altro to the world possessed. They lost in an extreme pleasure, that pleasantly exhausted them. 
A few days later, Dafne asked thing to Bob he/she wanted to do to Christmas. He seemed not to have preferences. 
«We could go to Tuscany from yours if it suits you, I don't want to force to stay you to Milan. And then there has never been!» it proposed him with calculated naturalness. 
«Dafne, doesn't suit me. Of sure they will go to mountain. I don't believe is the case to unite us to them, considering that I don't love the classical Christmas of family overcrowding. Decidedly hypocrite. If you and I went alone from some part?» it immediately diverted Bob. 
«I thought that I didn't return in Siena to my cause, excuse. I wanted only to make to know you that I would have been available to follow you.» 
Dafne climbed on the mirrors; his had been one calculated provocation. It had the nth demonstration that Bob had closed with the past but that he didn't evidently want to share its motives. 
It accepted him/it, this time you/he/she would not have allowed any strange thought to ruin her Christmas; the main point was to be together. 
«Ok my love, idea to go away is perfect! Do I have to talk to Moris of it only and to find a moment to dine with mine before departing; even you could come, is it now that knows you, don't you believe?» 
Dafne remained surprised, Bob seemed not to make a fold, you/he/she drew near her and he talked her to an impassive look. 
«Your parents will never be me nice, and for what you have told me I won't be never it to them. Would they give you boredoms only, disqualifying our relationship; you want indeed to keep on torturing you?» 
«You are right on this, but I wanted to show you that for me you are important, and I don't have to hide me with anybody» some embarrassed responded. 
«But I am greater than twelve years, and it is noticed. And as if it was not enough I/you/they have already been gotten married. I don't believe that I would bear the thousand questions of people bigot. It would give indeed me boredom.» 
Bob realized to have exaggerated, and the you/he/she drew near trying to embrace her/it. 
«Excuse me, I am your parents and me however I am not anybody to offend them; more before my love, let's think of us more before. Because to try everything to also ruin us this Christmas?» 
«It is alone that they begin to ask a lot of questions on you. they know that to boy The have and it is one year that The stays it wanders. I don't have to show nothing to anybody, above all to them; but I don't even want to hide what it makes me happy. I am my parents and you however you are my companion.» it told her disappointed, allowing to be embraced. 
«We will make him/it Daf, soon. Let's take us time up to our anniversary, then we will see. The love you to go crazy.» 
To that I love you Dafne it blushed, as every time that it felt him/it in unexpected moments. But a thought of Bob ruined that instant of tender understanding. 
«Now that I think it, thing means that you also have to ask to Moris? If it doesn't give you the permission don't we depart?» 
«But what devil does he/she take you this morning? Moris is my head; that you like or no I have to ask the permission. He/she offers a lot me more than a maid job. I make the turns that I want, despite both the last arrived, and he/she believes in my talent. Have you already forgotten the extra jobs that I have done thanks to him?» 
«Yes, as no. However the head of a cafe remains. After all these months are anchors submitting your future to a cafe! You know well that in my circle I can offer you commission yourself thousand more valid times, that would help you to reveal you a name in little time. Without counting that that Moristanis it admires well other of you, anything else other than talent!» 
«Therefore is it this the point Bob? This, is not true only? Are you jealous of him? Because I choose his/her help instead of yours and because you believe that its interest goes over?» churches her extremely annoyed. 
«I don't believe him/it, it is sure. That Morises it slobbers behind yourself in shameless way Daf, a mile is seen; it doesn't do at all far anything that type. And this thing begins to give me seriously on the nerves.» 
Dafne could not do anything else other than to beat behind the door of itself and to go to make himself/herself/themselves a hot shower. After all, that jealousy brusquely revealed was a pleasure for her. Still wet and with the open bathrobe it reached in bed it and it was thrown astride him above. 
«You are really a jealous idiot!» it exclaimed, grabbing his/her hands and still leaning her to him on the damp breast. 
«You are mine and it don't have to desire you any other, have you understood Daf?» it said him with serious tone. 
«God that fear! Beautiful sketch, trembles everybody! Also you are alone my, therefore troubles to you if I still see you talk to those sciacquettes in suit with which jobs; that you tell me of them? Don't those slobber?» he/she asked with sarcasm, returning him the hit, satisfied. 
Bob didn't answer and was thrown her above with extreme desire. 
When he went out, Dafne returned in bath and made him the nth shade; it opted for an one-party mahogany. The wanted us the whole rest of the morning. 
Bob and Dafne spent the Christmas to Livigno. The initial intention was that that Bob taught her to ski; in reality they made a lot of sex, induced by the warmth of the rustic log cabin that entertained them. 
The evening of Saint Stephen saw them back. 
«Dear my, know that the surprises are not ended. Tomorrow evening we will celebrate our anniversary. I hope for you is ready for a special evening» it solemnly pronounced Bob accompanying again her/it to house «footstep to take you at eight and half o'clock. Ah, not to be to go crazy on thing to put you.» 
Dafne was touching the sky with a finger, rather it had as the feeling to go beyond him/it with all herself, to go over. 
The following day, to the nine of the morning, someone played to his/her door. Still gone down by the bed drowsy and it brought him to open; it was a private messenger with a big package for her. Any sender. 
Dafne fell him on the table of the kitchen to open him/it. While it was trying to tear the external ribbon, curiosity quickly invaded her/it, so much to be made her embarrassed movements. To the inside it found a red ticket, leaned on a white velina, that protected and it concealed the content of the mysterious package. 

To my eccentric artist, to whom has taken my heart after so much time. To my passion. Wear him/it for me. you will be the most beautiful woman of the world. My woman. 
To tonight love, your Bob. 

Dafne didn't hold back the tear of emotion how fast the face crossed her; for an instant he/she didn't even remember more than to owe to discard him/it. 
Inside the package it found an elegant suit in thin velvet and black veil of first tailoring. To adorn sleeves and part of the bodice some ribbons of satin. It was a lot of refined person, but at the same time it seemed to respect the originality of the girl. Adherent up to the sides, the breast bandaged her in a pronounced neckline. In the inferior part it slightly widened, with a showy cleft that allowed to glimpse its right leg. Bob knew so well her to have found something good taste but particular, in perfect" style Dafne." In the package there were also a pair of boots in black skin to middle heel, with a lace silvered that it wound the ankle. 
The heart of Dafne went madly. When the evening began to dress himself/herself/themselves, it already presaged that that occasion would have been unforgettable. 
Bob arrived punctual as a Swiss clock. Dafne had picked up the hair wearing a black bracelet that the red head of hair broke her. He/she wore the you cover suit that had found with the suit and it set out to the car. He opened her the door, with romanticism of other times. You jumped to his neck, thanking him/it. Bob estranged him an instant from itself to look better her at estasiato. Dafne reciprocated the look admiring the perfection of it. It was the first time that he/she saw him/it in dark suit. It had the loose hair with a small tail that imprisoned the locks more court and rebels. An elegant long coat mended him/it from the prickly cold of that evening. 
«Therefore? Where do we go so beautiful?» churches her, touching his hair. 
«In Brianza, but I won't tell you other princess!» 
After forty minutes Dafne in front of itself a hill, on which a construction of exceptional charm and prestige. 
«What a hit comes me, are we going to eat up there?» he/she asked excited Dafne. 
«You/he/she can be. Do you like?» 
You wound him/it in an energetic embrace, regardless that he was still to the guide, in an excavated stradina and a little illuminated. 
Bob had succeeded in booking a small room all for them; you/he/she was a prestigious location, usually turned to marriages, business suppers or particular events. 
After the cake and the nth cup of good wine, Bob brought Dafne on the external balcony, from where the two could dominate the whole underlying zone. Once sat, the takings the hands infreddolite and he/she spoke to her, visibly embarrassed: 
«You have been a gust of fresh air, you have made again me beat the heart. Today I can tell you with certainty that I would do madness for you, that I want you as companion of my life, that with which to share everything, also the small things. I would like that from tomorrow I left that apartment and I came by myself.» 
Dafne believed to have beaten the head, to be in a dream from which would sadly be waked up again. But at the same time it felt on the face the cold air of end December, and it understood that it was everything true: Bob wanted to bring her/it to his/her house to share every moment, and not more the occasional evening or the weekend. Vanessa was dead, and it was also this time it what Dafne believed his/her bulky ghost. Bob would have shared with her the house that first you/he/she had been them. Its memory would have been indelible, in the whatever house, in whatever place, and it was correct this way. But now, with that application, Bob was declaring her to want indeed to turn page. It began a new life. 
«I love you, I love you, I love you» it repeated Dafne. 
To Bob it resulted to sufficiently be an answer affirmative. They kissed with passion for a lot of time, regardless of the cold and of the waiter that made capolino to bring the bitterses, up to that, I invaded by the irresistible desire to do other, they abandoned in hurry that place to fly in auto. 
Fifty-fifty January Dafne was completely established in the new house; Bob didn't succeed in being convinced himself/herself/themselves of as his/her companion you/he/she had invaded three quarters of his enormous capacious closet. 
«I never throw anything, I grow fond too much me to what I buy! Does forgive love, in the next days threw qualcosina, ok?» 
«Qualcosina? You feel Daf, we will buy a new closet to systematize in the other room!» 
They bursted in a sonorous laughter. 
Dafne had hoped correct, 2005 was his/her year; and the beginning of their cohabitation had been the evident test of it. 
Shortly after the I move, the two finally decided to go to dinner from the parents of Dafne. To that point it was mandatory. In forecast of that event, Dafne had spoken a lot of Bob to the last weeks, telling the more possible, and asking the maximum discretion to his/her/their parents on the personal life of the man. His/her mother had twisted the nose because of the difference of age, his/her father was oddly seemed encourages of it. 
«At least it is a man and you/he/she can watch you, considering that we don't know a cabbage of that that combines anymore.» 
His/her mother, without denying himself/herself/themselves, it was surlier. 
«You waited for the first child to bring him/it to house?» churches bored. 
«No mother, brings tonight it after one year because I wanted to live me my history without making I count to any of it as am now doing! I would ask you to be kind with him, if it doesn't cost yourself too work. And you dad not to begin with the third degree on his/her economic condition and on the job.» 
Those recommendations directly ended to the wind. This way, to the second course, the father of Dafne shamelessly asked to Bob of thing you/he/she occupied him in the life. Dafne intervened of hit. 
«Be' dad, he is the living demonstration that you/he/she can be lived of art in very discreet way!» 
«From the love, can I explain him of thing better even I deal me. art is to word burdens vague, doesn't it seem yourself?» 
After that puntualizzazione of Bob, to Dafne the whole rest of the supper seemed paradoxical; his/her companion had captured the attention of his/her/their parents, pleasantly entertaining them in a discussion on thing was the marketing, of the demands of the consumer and thing you/he/she did him in everything this; his/her man was amazed you/he/she had made the miracle. 
«In short, the single person is mistrustful, suspicious, for some verses very more alarm clock. While the mass is for the most part inconstant and condizionabile. Well, in the advertising countries it needs to think about the mass to bring them with astuteness to make them incuriosire. To create them a need» disquisiva Bob, while the father of Dafne handed him the nth glass of wine. 
«Is true, have always told him that are manipulated by the publicity! It is beautiful that who works us admits him/it. Pits for me I would not buy anything else other than meat and wine, nient'altro. The rest serves only to give money to whom wants to sell us stronzate.» 
You lost in a fat laughter. 
«To us it doesn't interest that they are useful or futile things. They pay us to convince the people to try. But we always depart from real promises. Today the publicity cannot afford to found himself/herself/themselves on the lie. It needs to attract the attention, more than to manipulate. Then all depends on thing him it intends for manipulation. It is sure what today it will arrange with me, to make money is essential to distinguish himself/herself/themselves. And I work with whom distinguishes» it settled Bob, with the steadiness ammaliante with which it clarified his/her convictions. 
Dafne looked at him/it with a grimace; with that last sentence on to make money you/he/she had loosened better hardly the heart of his/her/their father as you/he/she would not have been able to do. 
The evening was a success, Dafne had gotten a lot more than what it was waited. Once in car, a sonorous laughter been granted. 
«I had told you that my father is an absurd tightwad and you you have not wasted time to speak of your huge position of success!» 
«You are perhaps telling me that I have licked him the culo? I have said what I/you/they are in reality. And then on the money I think indeed her as him, better abounding that to be in famine, seems you?» 
«Wow, is really a shark! I hope to never make you competition. However I am happy that has been all right; a hit is taken him to know that I/you/he/she economically pass well her to you. Strange that has not departed with the solfa on the marriage. You/they will have left him as fears for the second supper.» 
«Money apart, creeds that our history is all right him? What is he liked indeed?» he/she asked Bob with unusual worry. 
«But Bob! Do you have present thing they were waited by me that two? A young idle rasta, or at the most a street artist. you/they have hand known instead as you. Don't even have made an indication to the age or rebukes on the cohabitation. he/she wants to say that you have conquered indeed them!» it replied her enthusiastic. 
«And instead to you, does it miss the idea of the young rasta or the street artist?» he/she asked Bob some melancholy. 
You looked at him/it for a handful of seconds, stranita. He avoided the look, turning the face toward the car window and the right hand passing himself/herself/itself among the lips. They reached house without adding an only word. Once in bedroom Dafne turned him to Bob, with air of whom could not hold him anymore inside what it was about to say. 
«You can say to be me you person in love of your prototype of ideal woman? I believe to be distant years light from your kind of ideal woman, even if you have never made me see photo of Vanessa. Yet you love me, and you have not stayed to the suits that I wear or to my style. You have looked over the appearance. Be', I do the same. Your beauty and your way of don't make me desire nient'altro. And I know that for you it is the same, even if I will be never elegant and ambitious as it was your wife or as they are your colleagues.» 
«Not to speak of Vanessa Daf. It doesn't suit me. to sleep, is now better exhausted.» 
That evening fell through in a veil of annoying bitterness. To Dafne that answer of Bob is not even was not liked some; it made her evil that of the whole done discourse, Bob had heard the necessity to answer only to the last part. 



Speaking of Bob 
For last Saturday of February, Moris decided to organize a party to the pub for his/her birthday and churches to Dafne to help to organize him/it the everything. 
«Needs to buy the material, I want to make a party to theme, something of detail, all Brera will have to remember himself/herself/themselves my birthday! Daf you have some idea? This way we begin to prepare the invitations. Will you help me true?» the churches Moris. 
«You need to ask me him? Certainly that I will help you! Will be the birthday of the year! I now stop by Bob, so I already tell him that next weekend job. We feel there in the afternoon and you will see that I will already have thought about something.» 
«You feel Dafne, if you already have appointments it doesn't care, me.» 
You immediately interrupted him/it. 
«Any appointment already organized, calm. By now we cohabit and the time together doesn't miss us. I prefer only immediately to inform him/it.» 
It smiled at him and it did for racing to the car, but Moris followed her/it. 
«Because I have the impression that you have to ask him the permission? I have felt you the other day to the jail cell, you gave him explanations on the fact that I/you had asked yourself to work sometime longer. And then the times that it comes here it waits out yourself, and granché doesn't die from the desire to greet; you know, it was some that I wanted to tell you him.» 
«But what do you say? I don't even remember of what phone call speaks. it doesn't enter because he/she doesn't want to invades my spaces. It seems cold, I know him/it, but I assure you that it is not quite this way. A thing is certain: if it was able, it would never make me work!» embarrassed Dafne visibly responded. 
«It would never make you work here, perhaps.» 
«But what you say Moris not to distort. If you had the opportunity of breaking the ice you could also get along. Don't make the paranoiac! The fact is that Bob works to the exhaustion, and when you/he/she reenters he prefers to be at home first possible, that's all. The now escape!» 
It quickly climbed in car after having him given as a present an affectionate kiss on the cheek. 
Dafne had tried to justify Bob to the eyes of Moris. Despite this, the affirmations of its friend had shaken her. It was nervous for the fact that the antipathy of its man towards its head had been perceived, and somehow you/he/she had tried to collide with. 
Despite everything, some, hour later the news of that weekends worked instigated in Bob an immoderate reaction. 
«What it means that will work the whole weekend for his/her birthday party?» churches howling, after having beaten the hands on the steering wheel «it doesn't have them any friends to make himself/herself/themselves organize a party? Does it have to ask him/it to the employees? You should think about making interviews Daf, and you persist you instead to be in that postaccios to make to exploit you!» 
While Bob expressed his/her thought with vehemence, the car you/he/she suddenly seemed to be too tightened for both. Bob hardly parked the auto, Dafne shelled out in a second. He reached her/it grabbing her/it for a wrist. 
«What cazzo you do? Don't touch me!» it said her wriggling himself/herself/itself. 
Him the resumptions the arm forcedly driving her/it toward an alley that opened to their right. 
«Not to shout me in face in this way Daf, and when we are speaking do you do me the favor to listen, have you understood well?» 
You remained of plaster in front of that aggressive attitude; he held her/it against the wall with vigor. After some instant it found the words to react. 
«Now you allow me and you immediately get further yourself; not to force to give you for me a kick in the middle of the legs» it howled with decision. 
You released and runs toward the car, departing with a big sgommata. He leaned him to the wall and him it passed the hands in the hair, stunned to have lost the control to that way. 
That evening Bob remained until late out. After lunch you/he/she had had out of town a meeting of job, from which he freed a lot after supper. Dafne waited him/it for alarm clock. You/he/she had tried to read a book, but you/he/she had realized that mezz'ora had served her for the same page. It considered to the scene in the alley, and he/she didn't succeed in believing in that reaction spropositata. 
The noise of the keys in the lock made her try a sudden shiver. He emerged from the redemption, preceded by an enormous bunch of roses redheads. You looked at him/it with coldness, session remaining. Bob drew near, and you/he/she broke the ice. 
«Love, doesn't know what is taken me. Forgive me Daf, you are me missed to be gone crazy.» 
It handed her the flowers. You picked them up in hand and it leaned them on the tavolino of the stay; it felt him embrace from behind with a delicate hold. Bob began to kiss her neck, whispering her more times his/her excuses. You were angry, but more he went on to kiss her back, so much the anger slipped anymore away. Bob continued to murmur her his/her love and his/her excuses, with the voice that hand by hand he did more and more gasping. 
«I am jealous of you. The go crazy to the thought that you spend burdens time with somebody hilts.» 
Dafne didn't turn him, leaving that its lips kept on grazing her back, by now naked. Not as soon as it tried to unthread her bra, her taken back lucidity and he/she answered him: 
«For me it deals with job; I help him/it to organize a party in the place. The birthday is a pretext to call people back and to work with fun. Today I would also have liked to invite you, but with that reaction you have not left the time of it. Moris is only a friend, and it is my head.» 
Dafne would have liked other thousand things, to still explain his/her disappointment and to try to understand the nature of his/her gesture, but Bob was passing her fingers on the lips, inviting to kiss her to her. It looked at her with a lost look, as if void it mattered, whether not to induce his/her woman to make the love. With the other hand you/he/she had started over unthreading her bra. You didn't hesitate. They pushed on the couch and without withstanding over, Bob it slipped her inside, turning that disappointment into excitement. 
To the dawn of the day later Dafne woke up in unusual way: Bob was caressing her breast with one of the roses that you/he/she had brought her the evening before. It smiled at her and it removed from her the covers of back, discovering her naked body. 
That morning Dafne had a strange feeling: the gesture was exciting her/it so much, but it was afraid that, as the most beautiful rose, also Bob could hide her a prickly and painful side. It forgot not the ugly thought as soon as his fingers took the place of the flower. 
The period that followed was everything anything else other than best. 
Bob began his/her one man show war towards Moris. Every attitude of his, message or called they seemed to arouse doubts and unsuitabilities. The job in the cafe had become, in its head, the only obstacle for all of this that Dafne would have been able to do. With the time the situation became unbearable and the girl, its despite, he convinced that Bob saw the things in more objective way, both on the profession, and on the relationship with Moris. Its head was perhaps endeared indeed in particular way and her he/she didn't succeed in realizing of it, while Bob, from man, it was more able to appraise him/it. With these doubts in the head, in March 2005, Dafne told Moris that the moment had come to understand whether to do from great and that the place would have left. Moris looked at her/it for an instant, that seemed endless to her, without telling her void; then the takings the face among the hands and the forehead kissed her. 
«After all worths of better. Don't forget yourself of us eh? You will be always here the preferred client. Good luck, small!» 
You/they had worked together for less than one year but to both the eyes you/they were done shiny. Moris invented an urgent appointment not to face over that sudden regard, that for strange games of the fate, you/he/she would not have been a goodbye. 
Dafne spent the following weeks to convince herself to have made the best thing. In the meantime, Bob maintained her/it and, despite you/he/she often repeated her that they were a family, that momentary unemployment created to the girl a terrible uneasiness. 
«I have proposed you four names last week, and you have fixed a solo an interview» it said him with suspicious, during a supper. 
«I would like to choose alone the agencies to feel; I don't want recommendations, and I don't want to be looked at as that assumed because it goes in bed with Chellini. I didn't perhaps have to leave the cafe so in hurry.» 
Dafne did for abandoning the table, but suddenly Bob grabbed him from behind pushing her/it toward the living room. Dafne turned him amazed toward his/her man; he for all answer grabbed him for the neck immobilizing her/it completely: 
«You don't go from any part don't force to make me things of which would repent! The that cafes don't return us and the discourse is closed. You are indeed an ungrateful!» 
He/she left the taking and it went away, dashing the door of entry behind of itself, with energy. 
Dafne was on the couch, still incredulous for what had just happened her; you/he/she could not be convinced of as Bob you/he/she had immobilized her once more, threatening her/it. 
Its head seemed to explode, he had again been aggressive. You/he/she had seen an unrecognizable look as the time in the alley. This time you/he/she had gone over, in way difficult to accept. Yet you/he/she had accepted him/it in silence, without not even reacting. That sudden violence of Bob had entirely him subdued and, some, hour later Dafne would inexplicably have forgiven her. 
To the one at night Bob doesn't was not get back home yet. Dafne didn't even succeed more to think about what had happened. Ideas were other that tormented her/it: the fact that was late, the fear that Bob was around with another woman or the fear that you/he/she would not even have reentered. These doubts shook him, while the rest seemed ended in a dark angle of the brain. Everything could turn, the main point was that Bob returned from her. 
At two o'clock at night the man opened the door of house. Dafne the runs meeting and to that point something of absurdity happened; it threw the braccias to his neck and it excused him beginning to kiss him/it with emphasis. 
«We have lost both the control. My love, where have you been? Rather he/she leaves alone, it doesn't care. You are right on the job, I know him/it. The beg only you not to be I know for to long time away with the out jail cell.» 
Bob interrupted her/it with a kiss, of those that remove the breath. The whole discourse that had in mind to make to be forgiven had not served. Bob had bewitched her completely. 
They felt both that only to make the love would have been able to cancel that happened disagreeable, and so they ended on the table of the kitchen in unbridled effusions, as if nothing was happened. 
The respectful Dafne of herself was as disappeared. Besides forgiving him/it and to choose not to clarify what happened, part of the responsibility was assumed. The anger had disappeared, absorbed by the fear that he could leave her/it. You/he/she had imagined him among the braccias of some attractive colleague, or in front of the grave of his/her/their wife, reformed to have forgotten her/it for a ragazzina without any ambition. All that thoughts had made her die of fear clouding entirely the brutal gesture of Bob. 



Speaking of Cassandra 
That spring was very warm, and not only for the climate. Weeks had passed by the disagreeable happened, and Dafne had begun a stage remunerated near an agency with which Bob often collaborated. It was a place of prominence with clients of notable prestige. In the staff, it recognized different people that Bob had introduced her in past or that in other occasions you/he/she had seen of escaped together with him. One of these were a woman, that looked at Bob with clearer interest and that Dafne, obviously considered from immediately an enemy,: Cassandra, a rich and refined heiress of the Brianza, art director of profession. 
To the beginning of the stage, the owner of the agency had formally introduced the two women: 
«Cassandra will place side by side you on the graphic part, is one of our horses of race! From what says Roberto you are firm from some with the programs that interest us. This is a limit. From what you will see in this agency, the rhythm doesn't forgive, not even the interns. In two weeks you owe to have recovered all!» then the manager turned him to Cassandra, confirming the concept «I beg me Chessi, you/he/she has to use everything to the perfection in maximum two weeks.» 
Dafne hated that people spoke of her as if there was not, but she also knew not to be able to propose the usual his/her rispostacces to the owner of that place. If you/he/she had not been for Bob, you/they would never have considered her. Sbottando would have let his/her man lose the face, and you/he/she would never have done him. 
After the first week, Dafne had already reached the ceiling of the patience. Cassandra was among the most unpleasant women that you/he/she had ever known; it didn't lose occasion to disqualify her/it, exalting to big voice every difficulty of his, both with Bob and with the owner. 
«But as it is possible that has frequented the courses of your school and that I/you/he/she am so back?» it told one day Bob, during a break coffee. 
«I know him/it, and I think that sooner or later I will leave that place really for the superficiality with which you/they treat certain subjects. And however it was firm from a piece, from the time. Its winning paper is the head; it has a creativeness out of the commune, you should aim at that. Besides, you should see how it paints» Bob answered, trying to throw out his/her girl from the hindrance. 
«I don't know him/it, you should address then perhaps her toward some gallery of art. Even the publicity doesn't impassion him as you would like. You see, I don't believe is only matter of knowledge, rather of desire. To the moment I have to always see all of his/her jobs again, also the stupidest things» it pricked Cassandra. 
«No, the publicity likes her; surely it is spaesata. but you will see that when it will pass to the part most important creative and, he/she will know how to surprise you!» 
«Be', I hope that the ragazzina doesn't pretend to begin from creative manager. The mess-tin exists for everybody, Robi, anybody excluded. Difficulty to believe that you live together and that is not exploiting the" number one" of the sector to learn the more possible. Robi, I would be a sponge to your side» it told Cassandra the attempt to adulate him/it. 
«Be' Cassandra, does perhaps other when we don't work. otherwise it would seem me to live in to spot, don't you find?» it specified Bob with prickly sarcasm. 
«Ok, has recepito! However you would be able at least to invite to introduce her/it him a tantino more sober. You know how the boss reasons, also the eye wants its part.» 
«It is not a customer, and it won't have relationships with the clients. And however I don't believe that Claudio will make appreciations on Dafne, trusted!» 
«Correct for precise statement, it won't be a customer, but here, as you would owe well to know, in the moments of flood all have to know how to manage everything: to comfortably be to the pc or to find himself/herself/themselves to manage a photographic set with the clients that breathe you on the neck. The beautiful times are ended in which stuck us to his/her own armchair. It seems me that you are not very objective Roberto. In short, creeds that your Dafne can manage all this?» 
After this last question, Cassandra turned the heels and returned in the office. Bob remained of stone, crushed by an avalanche of thoughts, with in hand his/her coffee by now cold. 
The morning later, Dafne and he were absorbed in the bathtub, overflowing of foam. 
«These salts are beautifully, don't you believe love?» it said her massaging his legs. 
«Yes, excellent. you feel Daf, that you say of it if today we went to center to make burdens shopping?» 
«Thing you want to buy love? Do you have to take other pole? Shirts?» 
«Really I thought to of the suits for you, I want to do you some gifts. Do you know, even something nice, different, that exalt your physicist, that you say of it?» 
Dafne got up in hurry from the tub, it recovered the bathrobe and it more quickly squirted still in the living room. Only few second and it reentered in bath as a fury. 
«Even something style Cassandra? And even better changing the color of hair? What do you say of it?» 
«Be', if a day I saw your natural color I would not be sorry. you would be very beautiful certainly» it said him going out of the tub. 
«You are a stupid!» it howled her. 
«Qual Daf is your problem? Do you make me go crazy as six, but that there is badly if for once I desire to see you in another way? And then in certain environments it also needs to know him to adapt. Am I an alone stupid because I do you him to notice?» 
«No, are a stupid because among all the agencies of the world have brought me in the only flood of sows fighette, that spends the whole time looking me crooked and to convince you that I always mistake something! And not to tell me that this gimmick of the shopping is flour of your sack Bob! Do you have to put you in head that I will be never neither as Cassandra, neither has as Vanessa, understood?» 
Bob immobilized her/it against the wall, with strength. 
«Perhaps is not you clear that don't have to speak of Vanessa! And then hands in comparison to the people with which bushels collaborating, understood? Have you understood me Daf?» without attending answer he dispersed, leaving her on the wrists marks that remained her for different minutes. 
Dafne was in the bed, still in bathrobe. Bob entered and the you/he/she laid down him of side. 
«Dafne you cannot use that language with me; I am not a little boy to which to address as you want. You don't have idea of how much people will live in the unattainable dream to enter an agency of the kind. We try only to make a turn and to see if we find something that is well you and that you like. You have a so beautiful physicist that will be easy.» 
This way saying inserted under her hands to the bathrobe, to embrace more intimately her. 
Dafne opposed a first resistance. You/he/she was embittered, absorbed in his/her thoughts and in his/her humiliation. At that time to feel his/her hands bothered her, perhaps for the first time. You removed, speaking to him without not even looking at him/it in face: 
«If I am well with everything, then you should not ask to suit me to me for the style of somebody else.» 
Bob for all answer still tried to touch her/it; Dafne shifted him in more definite way. 
«It doesn't suit me, I don't believe whether to resolve so our discussions are helping a lot us of these times.» 
Bob still drew near her. 
«Not to pretend that I/you/he/she don't go you; I want you, and also you, as always.» 
It began to graze her/it with definite pleasantness, up to appease his/her resistance. 
«And if today I didn't want instead yourself?» churches her, with gasping breath more and more, despite the attempt to appear indifferent. 
«If I didn't feel yourself excited, I would already have stopped.» 
To that point his look was her so near to be stunned it as every time that it looked at her/it in that way; its hands were making the rest and Dafne him he abandoned. 
This time, after having made the love, they escaped every tenderness. He was dressed again and he/she invited her/it to do the same, always convinced to reach the shops of the center. 
 
In the weekend Bob prepared to Dafne a romantic supper. You/he/she had turned on candles of every type creating the ideal environment for his/her eccentric girl. 
Dafne got back home, and some instant remained on the threshold, pleasantly surprise. 
«Thing is?» 
Him the it drew near and it helped him to remove the jacket. 
«It is for you, for us; I/you/they have lately been very nervous. It is one stressful period for both, I want that this evening is perfect, love.» 
Dafne had spent days a lot of difficulties, you/he/she was felt diminished by his/her man, it felt not to be to the height of Cassandra during the job, a true fish water's fuor. It felt that everything escaped her of hand. He/she remembered the aggressive attitudes of Bob, more and more frequent, and it often feared to lose him/it. But not as soon as he called her/it love, of hit it returned sure and satisfied, and the doubts faded away. Bob was right, that was alone an ugly moment. You/he/she was allowed to blind from the comparison with Cassandra and this was ruining everything. If you/he/she was striven to improve, then that period would have passed. Dafne was made load of everything, also of what had never depended on her. And the gesture of that supper convinced even more that Bob respected her/it, and that you/he/she would never have been able to lose him/it, or you/he/she would have lost his/her same life. 
«I/you/they have been hateful in this period, and do you organize me a surprise?» 
«Perhaps I have also mistaken me Daffy, or you have perhaps misunderstood my intentions. I like as you are, I would like only that on the job I/you could give the maximum one. You have a good opportunity among the hands. Cassandra has noticed a certain hostility on your behalf. And despite this tomorrow you/he/she has invited us to supper, both!» 
Dafne withdrew him in an instant, everything had suddenly returned grey. 
«Have ruined everything! I don't have any intention to see that stupid over the schedule I work! I am me that I don't go her to genius, and I was not wrong me, considering that doesn't waste time to come to make the victim with you every time that is able! God Bob, has done me really a beautiful surprise of the cazzo!» 
Taken the jacket and he/she left the apartment. He didn't do in time to stop her/it. 
Shortly after Bob fell to the art cafe of Moris, some that would have found her there. It drew near to the counter and churches of her: 
«Dafne is in the back with Moris, you/they are smoking a cigarette, if it waits.» 
The guy didn't succeed in ending the sentence, that Bob beyond the counter had passed for reaching them. It made a big effort to sustain himself/herself/themselves peaceful. 
«I looked for you from some, also cellular sule. I wait you in car.» 
Moris got up and did for shaking his hand, but Bob already turned for leaving. 
«Dafne, doesn't believe that this guy is everything to place, allow me him. thing you macaws, his/her puppet? Because you don't go on to tell me as the things do they go and indeed because falls here so incazzata?» 
But Dafne was not prepared to the dialogue anymore, neither to remain more there a second, knowing that Bob was to few meters, clearly raged. It was an appalling feeling. 
«It is as I told you first Moris, we are some nervous ones because of the job, but everything is all right, normal administration. I have been wrong to come here without telling him nothing; I also had the silent telephone. I now escape.» it said of hurry wearing the jacket with apparent nervousness. 
«No Daf, you felt like speaking and to smoke a cigarette with an old friend; and that type has come to take back you as it does him with a dog that escapes from the garden. But are you prepared to be to the leash indeed? Or are you the strong girl that doesn't send her to say? Also the sudden way according to which you have resigned has never convinced me.» 
«You are right, I don't send her to say: you don't know anything of me tantomeno of my companion. Don't take yourself certain confidences. I greet you.» 
Dafne and Bob reentered to house. For the whole trip you/they were not said a word. Bob had not even looked at her in face. You/he/she had never seen him/it so tense. It was afraid to have made a great foolishness letting with the only person that the ability had to make to become furious him/it being found. 
Once arrived, Bob closed you/he/she brings her/it to the shoulders and you/he/she turned him to Dafne with dry tone: 
«You have done him he/she waits for or had you already programmed to go to find him/it?» 
«But thing you say? I was stopped by Jessica and I have not found her. and I know The have thought about serving me to beer as Moris. I don't see us nothing of badly! I don't make you the third degree when late or disappear! I pray you, now we leave alone and we let's sleep above, I don't want to quarrel.» 
It tried to draw near to him, but it was inclined with vigor. 
«It stays where you are, I don't believe in a word. Did day, want to do me her to pay? What motive did you have for being alone in the back? What did you want to show? What did you want there to do with that failure of the cazzo?» 
Bob had begun to howl. It threw to the air the pillows of the couch, for then to do the same with a vase of glass, shattering him/it in thousand pieces against the wall of the stay. Dafne was squirted in bath, frightened by that uncontrollable anger. 
Bob followed her/it beating on the door with strength: 
«You open and Daf I, that cazzo wanted to do respond? What did you want to show? Did you want to slander me with the first imbecile?» 
«You frighten me Bob, calmed. calmed The pray you!» 
On the other side it felt to beat and to still inveigh for some, before an anxious total silence even more. 
Dafne him made not account than time had passed. That apparent calm was interrupted by some hits on the door. Bob invited her/it to go out, with a tone of voice this time submissive and checked. Dafne was afraid, he felt shake and unarmed, but it opened him. Bob the takings in arm and it brought her/it toward the room. It began to strip her/it with delicate but definite movements. The look of the man was fixed on its face, intense. You would have liked to speak, not certain to make the love. The first feeling in to feel those hands was of tension, but more Bob went on, more her he allowed to transport from that apparent return to the normalcy, together with the pleasure that only with him you/he/she tried. It was happy for the fact that Bob was not angrier and that the same ones desiring; only for this reason you/he/she would never have stopped him/it. After having left her/it in laundry it loosened her hair and it began to kiss her/it anywhere. They were kisses from the bitter taste, but after the first instants they were inexplicably an alone thing. 
He hardly freed him of his/her immense pleasure, Dafne it got up and he/she talked him to breath still twisted. 
«Bob we have made the love? Because to me this time you/he/she is seemed different. I don't succeed in not thinking about what has happened before, when I am me closed in bath; and to what is happening us from some» and it lost him in a sudden outlet. 
«No my love, begs you not to cry. Have gone in beast to see you with that guy, know him/it! We have only to relax us and you will see that everything serene will return. I don't want to see to cry you.» 
Bob tightened her/it to itself in an energetic embrace, reassuring. 
«Tomorrow evening we go to dinner from Cassandra, so we ask her to make to be you home next Fridays; I want one long weekend to go together away. Do we need it, doesn't it seem you?» churches him with hurry, holding tightened the woman of his/her life, that unarmed he allowed to wind. 
«Because you don't bring me from your parts, in Tuscany? I have realized that for some reason you want to be far of it, but we perhaps need to feel us more united possible in this moment; for me it would be beautiful to see where you were born and grown.» 
When Bob finally answered her in affirmative way, the heart exploded her of joy, as didn't happen for a long time her. 
Dafne felt him complete close to Bob. Despite this, in the most intense period of his/her life, over him it didn't have anybody. You/he/she had allowed that history to isolate her/it from the old contacts, the all worsened by an environment of hostile job. Bob was his/her only point of reference, the only person indeed partecipe of his/her life, by now completely monopolized by the will of the man. 
The fear to lose this reference had made her weak, totally incapable to defend the dignity and his/her own liberty. With little work, Bob succeeded in making to absolutely feel her/it in guilt for futile things. 
The supper from Cassandra was very bad oltremisura. The woman didn't lose occasion to tell his/her guests to Dafne and the others the enormous success of the advertising countries that Bob and she had created together, without counting the short and elegant attire that had decided to show off, despite the not exceptionality of the event. To midnight you/they had remained only their three in the terrace of an attic that dominated on half Milan. 
«The trip remembers yourself to Hamburg, Robi? There him that there was to laugh, however has been without doubt our country more succeeded! And it had been knowing only us for a couple of months.» it specified with extreme antipathy. 
Dafne was nervous, you/he/she had never felt anything of the trip to Hamburg, neither of the two strong agreement. Besides it disdained the way with which Cassandra displayed the thing in the clear attempt to make her/it ingelosire. Then not lost time to exploit his/her prickly sarcasm. 
«Strange, Roberto has reported me in the detail of a lot of publicities of success but this of which you speak you/he/she has not even named him to me among the important jobs. But I am certain that has been a good collaboration.» 
Bob, once to the car, it sank in an enormous laughter. 
«Is unbelievable, are indeed a viper! You have destroyed her in the pride!» 
«Be', didn't I know what you had traveled together for job; you are really intimate then?» churches her with provocative tone. 
«Intimate are the lovers and the friends Dafne. You are only a colleague; I have known her/it since 2002, and that year we have been one day and a half to Hamburg to introduce a country, that's all. For the rest, I see only her when I collaborate with his/her agency.» 
«Yes, but she owes to have aimed to qualcos'altro in that trip besides the success of a country. And it still aims us expensive my. And if you were objective as you are him/it for Moris, you should see him/it.» it said Dafne with touch. 
«But Cassandra follows you in one of the most important agencies in Milan, that Morises he/she offered you a maid job. Before the jealousies the point has always been this. Now promise me that up to the end of your stage you will try to go her to genius. It is a good spring board Daf, few they depart from places as that. And it would be the maximum one if Claudio assumed you. But you/he/she has been clear: I count a lot, but it won't assume only you for gentleness in my respects. And however you could become essential as future freelance.» 
Dafne would never have contradicted him. It was to the seventh sky, because before the terrible instants of the days seemed enfeebled. Bob was serene again. You looked at him/it trying to imagine the bad look that you/he/she had seen to slip out from that eyes in those sad occasions. In that instant, the face of its man seemed incapable to dye him of so much anger. Yet you/he/she had seen her and lived, and it labored to free himself/herself/themselves from the fear that similar scenes could be repeated. 
Cassandra decided not to grant on free Fridays to Dafne motivating the all with the excessive massive structure of job. The country to which you/they were working would have departed to brief, and this didn't allow truce any component of the team, inclusive interns. The weekend in Tuscany was postponed to given to destine him. Dafne was not quite amazed of it. 
The first June the girl showed a poster to Bob. 
«Damage a party to the art cafe Friday evening; it will be a party completely devoted a seventies, with a complete exposure of works and photos of the period and music to theme. It would be nice to go together us, I adore the parties years seventy!» it proposed with submissive air fearing pits a desperate attempt. 
«And then as you could miss?» he responded, pacifically. 
«Indeed? Oh love, will be amusing!» it exclaimed enthusiastic. 
«No, I won't come Daf; Fridays are in Turin the whole day. I will give to take you in late evening. I beg only you to give the correct confidence to that type. I am trying to give you trust and I don't want to repent me of it.» 
Dafne had gained one note of bother in the tone of Bob, but it was happy to not to have had to discuss, and definite to appreciate his/her effort. That evening would have been a gold occasion to see old knowledges again and to forget the serious faces and you plan that it was forced to see in agency. 
That Fridays evening a true panacea revealed him. Bob missed her, but at the same time you/he/she was enthusiastic in to see Moris, the old colleagues and the usual ones affectionate of the place again. 
Toward half evening, from the stereo they went out the notes of Strange Days of the Doorses; Dafne was to the entry of the place in the middle of about ten people that you/they drank their drinks. Moris drew near her. In an instant of truce you/he/she had left the counter to grant him a cigarette. 
«Well succeeded evening, true?» he/she asked her putting an arm around her neck. 
«Your evenings are always it.» 
«I am happy that you are here; you were the last person that I expected me to see. The regrets for the last time, The have made your business and The didn'ts have to allow me» he/she affirmed Moris with involved air. 
«No, you don't have to excuse you of nothing, I/you/they have been a cafona; I thought that you would not even have drawn near» she responded. 
«How I would be able? Be and will be always the craziest employee that have had! That evening seemed that your vivacity had disappeared, that the solar ragazzina that I had had among the feet was extinguished. I wanted only to recommend not to allow you anybody to hinder what you are. But as all the non in demand suggestions, I could avoid.» 
It threw from the cigarette, some embarrassed for what had just said. 
«And him where it is?» he/she asked Moris with interested air. 
«It will come here later. However, already that we are in matter, I care to tell you that Bob is not what you have intended you. He/she works from crazy, and out of his/her world it is always very mistrustful. Then the cohabitation is not easy. It needs to come him I meet quite a lot.» 
Dafne labored to continue in the embarrassment not to find other valid justification for the attitudes held by Bob in the few occasions in which you/he/she was ended to the cafe. 
«Already, all things that for one as me they are distant years light. However, for what I have seen, a thing is very evident: it is jealous lost of its woman, and I believe that I would be also it me to its place!» concluded Moris, certain to have found the only way to throw out the friend from that enormous difficulty. 
To every way it was satisfied, because you/he/she had succeeded in telling her thing he/she thought, in the hope that she could reflect us above. You/he/she was excused before cleverly for the suggestion of the time, observing anchors him/it to him. Moris embraced him with affection, almost by instinct. It felt Dafne extended as a rope of violin. It was not before anymore the natural and spontaneous girl of, this it was clear. 
To the one at night Bob entered the place, finding Dafne to the table with some girls; you/he/she drew near and he asked her to accompany him/it to the counter to order a beer. It had the tired air, and she appreciated a lot his/her effort in to want him to stop. That man's apparition ever seen didn't pass certain unnoticed. A lot of girls were exalted for that attractive and mysterious presence, but Bob felt out place in unbelievable way. 
With Moris they were greeted as soon as, and Dafne looked for an immediate way to manage the uneasiness. 
«We go out? I want to smoke.» 
Bob nodded. It was silent, apparently calm. 
«You have had a good time?» he/she asked her with interest. 
«Yes love. but macaws me missed! Is it to you as you/he/she has gone to Turin?» 
«Well, but I tell you tomorrow. For tonight with the job I have closed, I am exhausted.» 
Dafne reentered for a fast turn of regards. Then they directed him toward the auto of Bob, parked a little far. 
Entered desert alley, they crossed two boys coming from the opposite direction; they decidedly had the air few sober. One of the two stopped him to stare at Dafne. It was James, the guy English with which the girl had had the disagreeable meeting during the disappearance of Bob. 
Dafne tried to ignore him but James not lost the occasion to be silent: 
«My darling! Be really you! Always very beautiful!» 
Bob went him before, but Dafne tried to hold back him/it. 
«You know this drunk of merda?» it immediately howled vexed Bob. 
«You talk to me? What his/her boyfriend you are? You are fortunate, with me you/he/she has done some the difficult one!» after this first frecciata, James turned to the friend «however you/he/she has some beautiful breasts!» 
Bob was him I set in an instant and you/he/she began to strike him/it. Dafne and the other boy succeeded to work in getting further him/it. Bob was a fury. Not as soon as James fell in earth, too much drunk to react, Bob returned in itself and dragged away Dafne. The girl was stunned, stopped by that unexpected scene. 
Once in house, Bob entered for first. Dafne followed him/it sobbing as a child. The man had driven as a crazy person without saying an only word for the whole journey. 
«Who cazzo was? And when cazzo you have given him confidence? Answer me!» 
«You/he/she has been when you have disappeared, during the first Christmas; I thought I/you had left me, I was desperate.» it told her among the hiccups trying to approach him/it, but Bob escaped, walking in stay as to lion in the cage. 
«Therefore did you already know me? And that cazzo has done us? Are you swept him/it to you?» 
«But thing you say? No Bob, swears you him! I/you/they have gone his/her home for a party. I have drunk some and that you/he/she has tried only us. But I swear you that nothing serious has not happened, it was drunk also him. I beg you Bob you have to believe me!» it begged her. 
Bob for all answer pushed her/it with strength. 
«Only tried eh? And your beautiful breasts you/he/she has imagined only her? According to you worth to be with a liar that makes him palpate to the first quarrel? And thing I should wait later me? You answer!» 
«Bob you you gone n'eri, has been also your guilt if I have been reduced to that way!» it howled Dafne in the attempt to excuse him. 
That further accusation let Bob, that began to strike her/it went crazy entirely. This time it was not a fast instinctive gesture. It beat her, so much to be broken her lip. After instants that seemed her endless, Dafne it felt truce from the hits. It stayed unarmed and painful for earth, until him it went to close him in bath, distorted. 
Dafne escaped in bedroom. The eyes went her on the specchiera, and at that time it realized only to have the bloody underlip. Bob went out of the bath, and their looks were crossed, for an endless instant. It fell her to the feet, tightening her legs and beginning to cry desperate. It kept on asking it excuses her, saying that it didn't understand what him had passed for the head. 
Dafne seemed not to react; the shock of that beating had estranged her completely. Bob conducted her/it in bath, you/he/she bathed her lips with sweetness, holding her/it hold among the braccias. It continued to caress her/it and to take care of her face, in the attempt to make to disappear that blood, evident sign of what had just done. Dafne didn't succeed in saying an only word, neither to react somehow. Silent and suffering, it continued to listen to his/her complaints and his/her excuses. 
«Everything my love will go. well The wills calm down me and will speak, The didn'ts want. my love The didn'ts want! I don't know what is taken me, I don't know him/it my love, forgive me, I/you/they have never been so jealous.» 
The takings in arm and it brought in bed her. Hold held her to itself the whole night, cuddling continuously her, except in the few moments in which you/he/she had surrendered to the sleep. 
To the morning Dafne opened the eyes. It was a hard hit to become himself/herself/themselves account that was not treated of a nightmare. Luckily it was Saturday, and you/he/she would not have worked. Gone down by the bed, still benumbed, you/he/she immediately was reached by him. 
«Love as you feel yourself? Do you want some tea some milk? Tell me something» churches suppliant. 
«Give me an instant Bob; I don't want anything, I pray you» she responded turning himself/herself/itself on a side, to give his shoulders. 
«Love goes, well but you tell me that you are well, I pray you.» 
«How I could be well Bob? As? Last night you were another, I didn't recognize you. You could kill that boy to kicks and you have also hurt me. I have never done you nothing, but you keep on not entrusting you» it said her bursting to cry. 
«No love I beg you not to say other. I have lost the head, I know him/it, but it is because I love too much you. I know that it is not a justification, but I am afraid to lose you and this it makes me react badly. I pray you forgive me.» 
Bob had an agonizing tone as a defenseless child on the point to be abandoned. Also crushed by that discouragement, it was beautiful in embarrassing way. His/her excuses, loaded of strong pathoses, were convincing so much that Dafne could not ignore him/it over. It tightened him/it beginning to reassure him/it. The victim consoled the executioner paradoxically feeling himself/herself/itself in guilt in to see him/it so tormented. 
Dafne had forgiven him/it. Again. It madly loved him/it, and that fond and thoughtful attitudes had still transported her in the most attractive dimension of their love story, that sort of passion and beautiful promises, of mutual trust and sweetness. Bob stayed nearby her the whole day. A small crust on the lip was all of this that he/she assiduously remembered that episode. 
Dafne had told in the detail thing you/he/she was happened in that sad night of Saint Stephen, and Bob had embraced her the whole time, listening with visible tension. 
«Because you didn't speak then of it? Do I want that our relationship is sincere, because I didn't know anything? I would have beaten him very before and expeditious to the first barracks. Daf, I want indeed to trust you, but so you don't help me.» 
It dragged her to itself, making to feel her the warm one of his/her open abdomen. 
«Bob, if Friday had arrived someone there would you be ended in barracks. and would you/he/she have been worth of it? I hope only that were so you intoxicate not to say anything.» 
«It won't say anything. It is only a pig. Import only me that has understood that it doesn't have anymore to look you. I would like a true family with you, and I don't want but a situation so.» 
Without finishing the sentence the face it covered him with the hands, to hide in vain the expression that dampened him to the alone thought of thing you/he/she had done once her reentered to house. 
You gained his/her state of mind and it seduced him/it before the ugly thoughts of the evening returned as before among them they were already it. They made the love, with the passion that only two completely fused souls the one to the other one could conceive. He kissed her/it in embarrassed way, for fear to hurt her. Dafne serenely drove him/it inside of itself, lost in his/her eyes, lost in that extreme love. 
You/he/she had just felt that Bob wanted a true family with her. He/she now knew that the eternity comparison with the importance of Vanessa was a nonexistent fear. In the desperation he had spoken of family, and she grabbed on to that hope forgetting the whole rest. Dafne still ignored that the episode of that Fridays night would have been replied soon, the first one becoming of a long series of disagreeable beatings, that you/they would be done less and less sporadic. 



Speaking of sick love 
In the turn of little time Dafne didn't even succeed more to suppose and to understand the causes that produced the anger of Bob. In a first phase, the motive scatenante had been the jealousy, but with the time, every motive seemed good to attack her/it, both orally and physically. Everything was born from the strong insecurity of Bob, that she totally paid, doing I load. The all ended with the the usual pathetic teatrino, followed by the overwhelming sexual spiral, that every time brought them in the pseudo normalcy of their relationship. 
In September Bob had programmed the long one and very attended visit in Tuscany, to make to know to Dafne his/her roots and the places in which you/he/she was grown. Nevertheless, a few days before the departure, you/he/she had received news from Cassandra for a possible candidacy of Dafne in an agency of his/her knowledge. When Bob had communicated her that you/he/she would have been the case not to depart because of the interview, Dafne went, predictably, on all the furies. 
«I don't believe it! Does it jump then again? And all for the recommendation of that harpy? How come doesn't it make me assume where he/she works her and where have I done the my fantastic stage? I tell you him me because, because doesn't want me among the feet when go to work from them! And then I am tired, tired to postpone this visit from yours! Because we don't owe Bob to go us?» 
Dafne had been taken by a sudden delirium, you/he/she was spitting him I set all of his/her frustration, nonchalant of the possible anger that would have been able to instigate in him. Instead Bob listened from the beginning at the end in religious silence. 
«Daf, tries to calm you.» 
«Me? Do I have to calm me? In two years have never felt you speak of them, neither of your brother, neither of other relatives, never! I don't know what discover doesn't like me! And then I don't want to make the graphics in an agency chosen by that woman. Be me disgusting, and I don't want to be as you, to live only of fottuto job!» it howled agitated in an only breath. 
Dafne had thrown out an enormous outlet, that had been being held within perhaps for months; you/he/she had done him/it with an arrogance that seemed not to belong for a long time her. He maintained the firm nerves, partly spiazzato from that sudden release of the companion. 
«I will pretend not to have felt. Last week you have planted me all those questions on as and when I go to the cemetery from Vanessa; then on where all of its things were. And now this nth placed on my parents. My past doesn't owe Dafne to concern you. Don't hinder yourself.» 
But Dafne was by now too incattivita to stop, and it threw him in face other insecurities and other hate for the interview that imposed her to do. It blamed him that to his/her cause and of the useless his/her stage, in the last six months you/he/she had not even had time for a painting. To that sentence Bob took the first object from the table and dashed him/it to him I set, for then to slap her/it with vehemence, up to that Dafne implored him/it to stop, excusing out himself/herself/itself for his/her outlet place. After having stopped, Bob was beaten you/he/she brings her/it to the shoulders, to reappear only in late evening. Dafne had coldly welcomed him/it, but he had thrown out of the pocket a velvety wrap, with inside a ring of white gold: 
«This is for making to forgive me and to show you how much I love you. I would like that I immediately wore him/it and I would like to make you a portrait with only this I set.» 
Of first I lead off, Dafne stayed dark, because of the nth beating of few hours before. After an instant its eyes shone, in front of that gift, of certain expensive. Besides, the idea that he wanted to withdraw her/it, more whatever gift excited her/it, returning her certainty that sooner or later Bob would have stopped to attack, that that would have returned some beginning her/it, his/her artist, his/her dessert lover. Dafne went on to the awareness that that whole evil was always mended by the precious instants in which Bob succeeded in surprising her/it. 
Bob is badly for something of the past that the tormented one, this was what Dafne you/he/she repeated him in the head. According to his/her hypotheses, after the death of his/her/their wife, you/he/she could have developed a sort of obsessive phobia, a constant fear to lose the beloved person, skipping so all the other affective and family relationships. You could not know what he/she meant to lose someone that is loved forever. The only thought chilled her/it. Made these considerations, it considered to his/her outlet and it felt him bad, paradoxically in guilt for the fact not to succeed in recovering him/it from that pain. 
Bob was his/her angel and his/her demon, present in ambivalent way in the same body and in the same soul. 
The day later Dafne was introduced to the famous interview, more to gratify Bob that for the fact to have changed mind. Despite the references and the opportunity, you/he/she was not assumed. 
To that news, Bob reacted very bad. It began exposing in way detached what he/she thought. 
«Cassandra has personally talked to the Mr. Cadets. You/they have still found your immature profile for the sought after position» it communicated him pouring himself/herself/itself to drink. 
«And would it be my guilt?» churches her, angry. 
«Have not ended! For your little experience, have only to thank that cafes of poveretti where have lost one year of time! But is the aspect that indeed bewilders me another; it was indeed the case to tell the Mr. Cadets that the publicity is not everything and that it doesn't need to plagiarize the people?» he/she asked Bob to narrow teeth, visibly angry. 
«I have said only what I thought.» 
«Have said only what would have guaranteed you to be discarded! Do you have it foresees the figure that Cassandra and I have done us?» it thundered Bob beginning to lose the control. 
«I am tired not to have freedom of speech anymore Bob! I always feel me under accuses, I feel me a puppet to your image and similarity! I try everything but they are never to your height! I am tired Bob, tired! Yes, I didn't want that place!» 
Bob didn't deny him. Her tone and the confirmation that you/he/she had sabotaged the interview, had vexed him/it; it was her I set in an instant. In those circumstances, what mostly shocked the girl, it was the metamorphosis of that look that so much loved. His ferocity in to strike seemed her/it untamable, literally turning him/it into an animal. In that occasion, Dafne didn't easily succeed in getting truce from the blows, so much to react, doing himself/herself/itself escape a desperate invocation of help. To the solo to feel entirely that word Bob sragionò. 
«Help? Do you need help now also? Do you believe me crazy? Or are you you to provoke me every time? Don't the slaps perhaps serve you to nothing today, does it perhaps serve you other, it is not true?» the churches in provocative way, dragging her/it in room. 
Dafne was desperate, incapable to defend himself/herself/themselves. It was as him same bewaring the scene of the outside, and that could not be the man that had known and that you/he/she had brought her thousand times to graze the sky with a finger. That man that was her above and that it stripped her/it with fury, it dragged her/it to the hell. Its attempts to wriggle out himself/herself/themselves, increased the unheard of anger of Bob, that went on to its bleak intention. For Dafne, the sex with Bob had always been the idyllic dimension that succeeded in leveling the things. This time you/he/she would not be happened. Bob was punishing her/it with the saddest gesture. It tried to penetrate her/it with strength, forcing her/it in the most painful sexual relation of his/her life. Only the ring of the telephone put an end to that humiliating, how much unbearable experience. Bob didn't answer, but you/he/she chilled, as if of hit had returned in itself. Dafne was asunder, morally and physically. He had beaten her by now so many times, but never with that impetus, and you/he/she had ever tried to violate her/it to that way. 
Bob had realized that Dafne would have been able to stop forgiving him/it and to suffer, looking for help. This the tormented one: Dafne was his and of nessun'altro. The whole night went by to the insignia of the pathetic excuses and the usual ones I will change, howled to big voice. But this time it labored to look at her/it in the eyes, shame overhung him/it. 
«Tonight I have understood that I can lose indeed you; when you have howled" help" you have killed me Daf. I have understood that you hold me a monster, a man from which to run away. And I become me account that I/you/they am him/it. But I want to change, to understand what is happening me, before is too late.» 
Dafne was reduced badly. This time the signs of the violence were evident, and you/they would have remained him/it for days. And those internal would not perhaps have gone away never. This trapped her/it in an unbelievable paradox. He/she didn't succeed only even in thinking about leaving him/it, because it loved him/it, always able to believe in his/her excuses. At the same time it was full of livid and, considering to that moments, it tried disgust. Bob had also dirtied their untouchable agreement that in which you/they melted soul and body. He asked her to strike him/it, he/she asked her to return him the physical evil that had inflicted her, the churches even to make the love, this time as their solo they knew how to do. 
«Bob I love you to die but I am afraid» confided her, lost in a resigned weeping «first were another, were not you! You the you are not at all taken. It was a normal divergence, as happens to so many couples. Instead we am ended on this bed, with tore me to you the laundry of back! You have looked for.» 
Dafne didn't succeed in concluding. If the telephone had not brought him/it in itself, he would have raped her, and she didn't even succeed in saying him/it. You/he/she would have been as to everything admit him/it to herself. Dafne would have preferred to have to whether to do with times and times of kicks and fists, rather than with that attempt of violence. In his/her unconscious you/he/she would have preferred even to be raped by a stranger, that to risk that abuse from the man of his/her life. Yet the love for him was, inexplicably, stronger. It was as if those violences fed him/it. Bob his/her mind and his/her heart; he succeeded in always giving her a good hope to go on, while the things, in reality, they worsened. To be with him had become painful, but even more spine-chilling it was the perspective to be without. Dafne had to do with one of that men that probably you/they would never be changed, that would have dominated her making her/it succube. It was as if it didn't have full conscience of all of this that suffered, even though aware that after the cohabitation, his/her man was turned into another person. Despite everything it was as if you/he/she could not do to anymore of it less, managed from useless senses of guilt and from an inexplicable unchanged feeling. Theirs seemed to be, from both the parts, a real sick love. 



Speaking of the true Bob. 
To beginning December, Bob, without granting her great possibility of objection, you/he/she had succeeded in making to enter Dafne another agency. It was mediocre in comparison to others, but it was without doubt a good territory to store experience and to remain in the environment. 
Dafne found that agency a more pleasant place in comparison to the pits of lions known up to that moment. The job didn't thrill her/it in unbelievable way, but at least he/she succeeded in producing something in autonomy, without more anybody that hold marked her/it. In comparison to the standard of the agency, Dafne was revealed from immediately the miliary stone, and for this they left her a lot of space, allowing to exploit at the most her tied up creativeness to that sector. The job had become the only outlet from that life of couple that alternated him between apparent serenity and sudden overcoming. 
The episodes of violence had become for Dafne it departs of its normalcy. You/he/she was convinced that they existed women that had to whether to do with sick men others that attended husbands or engaged addicts. You was found again to make the accounts with a violent. 
Despite you/he/she had been satisfied him/it on the tied up aspect to the profession, the jealousy of Bob and his/her continuous wish with to hold dark the really lived, they always offered him new you sprout for attacking her/it. Despite everything, Bob was the man from which Dafne didn't succeed in detaching himself/herself/themselves. It easily abused her without succeeding in making to be hated. Some days it beat her/it to the wall with strength, others it made her deliver fifty roses redheads in the office, without any particular recurrence. In the moments of calm, the most scheming man that had ever known stayed. In his/her social relationships, purely working, it was the same usual: impeccable, bright, detached but gracefully. At times it brought her/it with itself to some events. In public it seemed her to relive their history to the dawns, when he was his inevitable sweet Bob, admired by everybody, but that only she could have. 
Just before Christmas, the mother of Dafne gave to find her/it to discuss the details of the eve. In that occasion the girl was not remembered to hide a livid appeared on the wrist. After having arrancato excuses, account you/he/she was made that owed to pay greater attention. His/her mother had believed in the version of the fall, but you/he/she had not wasted time to launch her some battutinas. 
«You/he/she could not climb us that your stallion on the staircase to clean the farettis? It looks there that ugly stuff!» 
Dafne mentioned a forgery smile, of the series" to laugh for not crying." To get away himself/herself/themselves his/her mother of I return it immediately accepted the culinary proposals of the woman. He/she sent away then her alleging working excuses. 
The evening didn't miss the nth burst of Bob, that this time takings the pretext of the scarce communication of the fiancée. 
«You could ask me if it was a pleasure for me to pass the parties from yours, it doesn't seem you?» it nervously said. 
«I wanted that you/he/she had to be suffered. you/he/she has seen me the livid one on the arm, did it keep on asking questions, that The hads to I give?» 
«What questions?» it squirted frantic Bob. 
«Not to fear, has told her that I am fallen; I would like only that a situation so not ricapitasse more Bob. Me. The don'ts make dark her/it.» 
Bob drew near her to kiss her/it, that sentence you/he/she had calmed the initial impetus, usually followed by the usual beating. But she didn't seem pushing him/it street with resistance happy of it. This instigated again his/her anger, that this time didn't appease him. It conducted her with the shoulders to the wall, tightening her slender neck. He/she let her go only after having realized that Dafne breathed to work. The girl emphatically coughed for a few minutes after having dragged on the couch. Bob allowed to fall in knee on the floor, stunned from what happened; you/he/she had just referred him, and its self-control seemed to be reduced himself/herself/themselves, of time in time. 
The eve of Christmas was a disaster. Dafne was badly. Its body seemed to have reached the limit of the patience, not helped by the influence of season. In the last period he/she ate little, and his/her parents, an instant of his/her absence taking advantage, Bob you/they were turned to, with worried air. 
«Bob, but does this girl eat or she works and enough? You/he/she has always been thin, but it seems too much now indeed me.» churches his/her father with worry. 
«You/he/she is eating few in effects. December is one period of strong stress in our sector. A gratifying but intense job. I am absorbed also me, and I have perhaps neglected the thing; I am sorry it. I promise her that I will personally take care of it» Bob reassured him/it. 
To confirm the apprehension of the parents of Dafne, was one sudden shortcoming of his just before midnight. The two reentered to house. Dafne hardly succeeded in making himself/herself/themselves a shower, stunned by the tall fever and by the tiredness both physics how moral. It fell asleep exhausted, still in bathrobe. 
He/she had been sleeping by now for a couple of hours. Bob had remained in the room to watch an a little famous Japanese movie. The images flowed in front of its eyes, yet it seemed not to follow her, wound as it was in different thoughts. It was restless. The parents of Dafne had noticed the discomfort of his/her/their daughter, not due of certain to the fever. If Dafne had continued to somatizzare in that way, soon you/they would also have noticed him/it to the job. You realized that Dafne was exhausting the strengths. At that time of cold lucidity, it realized that you/he/she would have been able to lose her/it from a moment to the other. What its head did for holding her/it more neighbor, risked to make the opposite effect get him. He/she also thought to how many men would have been able to have her/it doing her/it them to his/her place. Finally, for an endless instant, Bob thought about the past. Stunned by those thousand reflections, it sank of hit in the panic; the only way that came him to mind to find immediate peace, was to reach her/it to make the love. Absolutely nonchalant of the conditions of the girl, it began to touch her/it. Dafne, because of the tall fever and of the medicines, he didn't wake up. 
Bob understood that the girl would never have had desire and strengths to make the love with him. Despite everything he/she wanted her/it, and seeing that sweaty body and semiscoperto, definite to go on in to kiss her/it and to touch her/it. To a line Dafne suffered a shiver of cold, that aroused her/it. It stayed immovable, with the lost look in the dark. It was naked and it felt the insistent effusions that Bob was granting with his/her unarmed body. It was stranita from that nth violation, to which stentava to believe. It faked to sleep, letting his/her desire to satiate him/it, that fortunately he exhausted in few instants; to her they seemed endless. Bob with that contact appeased his/her insecurities, by now in balìa of the fear. Numerous tears ploughed silent the face of Dafne that instead it realized, more and more shinily, the serious problems of the man. 
In the following days there was no indication to the happened one. Despite this, Bob realized that the look of the companion was dangerously far every more day. 



Speaking of past 
In the first months of 2006, the agency in which he/she worked Dafne had a big decrease of job. For such reason you/he/she was communicated her that for one undetermined period you/he/she would have worked only three days to week. The job liked her, also because you/he/she had succeeded in dealing himself/herself/themselves with some manual storyboards. Also the way according to which you/they had welcomed her had been positive. With a pair of girls you/he/she had exchanged the number, and every now and then he/she met her. Despite the actual working pleasure, that drastic cut of schedule didn't worry at all her. You/he/she would have started over looking for errands for portraits or frescos. And the occasions didn't delay to arrive. 
Bob was very taken from an advertising country and from the examinations of end semester of the school. In appearance they were enough serene months, as to define the life of Dafne serene pits by now a true ossimoro. To reach weekend without encountering himself/herself/themselves with his/her anger the maximum one had become some idyll. Yet, you/he/she had not considered the idea to leave him/it yet. Bob his/her mind and kept on trapping her heart. You/he/she had tried disgust for certain his/her attitudes, especially in to see to dirty him/it theirs impeccable and ardent sexual intimacy. Despite everything, he always succeeded in making the most precious creature feel her/it to the world, maintaining intact the ability to surprise her/it. You/they had tried to face the discourse of his/her violence but, inevitably, the compassionate outlets of Bob succeeded in making to feel her/it in defect: it was guilt of the stress. he/she didn't succeed in having self-control himself/herself/themselves. it kept on picking up him her with the person dark that it loved to the world without understanding its motive. And, despite the constant terror, Dafne believed him. From whatever point of view it analyzed the thing, it was literally incapable to give up him. This all it took is only for explaining his/her permanence in that house; you/he/she was disgusted, frightened, unhappy, but it was not ready to give up him. To you treat you/he/she was convinced indeed that with his/her love Bob would be recovered by that problem, hopeful of the fact that one day would have stopped indeed. 
Fifty-fifty February Bob had to leave Italy for a week. London would be brought to serve as chairman to a conference on the communication of mass. He/she asked to Dafne to follow him/it, but he/she personally heard the phone call between the head of the agency and she, that not the granted the necessary days of vacations, because of the schedule already meeting place. Bob was a lion in the cage; the thought to leave him/it to her tortured, but you/he/she could not allow that it lost the job after the weary difficulties to give him/it for him. 
Packing the suitcases, it looked at her/it for some instants, then it drew near her. 
«You won't make me regret having departed, true?» 
«But what do you say?» churches her with air stranita. 
In reality you/he/she had perfectly understood the allusions of the question. Bob feared an escape or some whim. The mind of Dafne it was confused. Bob thought about one disappearance of his, while she didn't distantly have even it considered. Who of the two it was the insane one? 
«He/she leaves alone, they were thoughts of the cabbage. If you go out I want to know him/it. And do I want to be calm Daf, of accord? And it avoids that old cafes, please» it sentenced with anxiety. 
It drew near her with demoralized expression. You kissed him/it. He/she wanted to feel been desired before his/her departure, or he/she perhaps wanted to engrave those feelings in the head trying to remember only those during his/her absence. They lost for a long time in those that had been for a long time their small erotic games. They made the love in energetic way. You howled his/her pleasure as it didn't happen for a long time. Some, hour later Dafne looked at their bodies still united, reflected in the mirror of the wall. It observed Bob, immovable under of her, in all of his/her statuary garishness, with the long silvered hair, I moved by the sweat and abandoned on the pillow. It observed for a long time then the face, that still preserved the expression pleasantly upset by the orgasm of it. It was that his/her Bob, it was that his image that it still loved hopelessly and that you/he/she would have liked to stop in the mind. It was February 12 th 2006. The day later, to the dawn, he would have departed. That departure, for Dafne, you/he/she would have changed everything. 
After having spent two hours to the telephone with Bob on the occasion of St. Valentine, decided Dafne that had to enjoy himself/herself/themselves somehow the days of absolute liberty that stayed her. In particular way, the girl was happy that his/her man had always detested the idea of the fixed telephone. The evening of February 15, Bob called her/it toward the eleven, before going to sleep. The silence gave him certainty that Dafne was at home. In reality, at 23.45 o'clock, the girl was already making capolino to the cafe of Moris. It was aware of to strongly betray the trust of Bob, but it was also aware of to have taken so many blows without never having done him/it. It was not calm with herself, but only with Moris you/he/she would have been able to make indeed two friendly chatters, and the desire was uncontrollable. Even if the contacts had not been frequent, their nice tuning rifiorì as if you/they were seen every week. They embraced with affection. Moris was radiant in to see her/it again, so much to get out of himself/herself/themselves the apron and to howl to the boys to the counter that would have made the client in honor of an old friend for that evening. 
They were departed two hours from that embrace of the beginning, and the two had talked to gust in an angolino of the cafe. You had told him all of his/her working developments and Moris it seemed enough pleased of it. However something told him that, in the private life of the friend, nothing pits indeed to place. It had at night confirmation disagreeable of it to the one, when the effect of the alcohol eluded entirely the defensive barrier that Dafne was built around. Moris had asked her a simple question. 
«And with him. the cohabitation is all right indeed as you want to make to believe?» 
To Dafne, in that instant, the world fell I set. You/he/she had held too for a long time the secret of his/her torments, so much not to be succeeded in pretending of nothing anymore. The affectionate tone of Moris, a bitterness of too much and the certainty that Bob was distant kilometers, brought her/it to a real psychological collapse. It began to cry as a baby to which you/they had torn away the most beautiful game. Moris hurried some fast matter to the cafe and entrusted one of his/her collaborators of the closing, thing that didn't easily happen, since on the job it delegated to work. But that evening a friend needed him, and by instinct definite to bring her/it to his/her house. To that point, after having tried to render less dramatic for a longer time possible, insistette so that Dafne told everything, up to that she removed the brake. 
«It is not everything perfect. Beat me, and him ago from a piece. To the beginning I/you/they have been done occasional, then you/he/she has become a routine. and The don'ts know thing anymore to I give» he/she confessed her of yarn, interrupted new by weeping. 
Moris threw a kick to the couch, doing himself/herself/itself escape different curses. It seemed to go crazy. It hardly realized that the thing had paralysed Dafne, the it drew near and the churches it excuses. 
«Forgive me small. From how long it goes on so with that bastard? You have to now tell me everything, everything!» 
Dafne, after a first hesitation, he allowed to drag from the events and it told of as the idyllic history with Bob you/he/she was turned into constant terror. He/she finally succeeded in freeing himself/herself/themselves of that enormous weight that in the time you/he/she had torn to pieces her, and to relieve himself/herself/themselves helped him to realize how much. 
But after the first agonizing story, Dafne didn't succeed in not speaking of his/her depth love for him, beginning to throw out numerous excuses and justification to those inexplicable violences. 
Moris understood that the mind of Dafne it was confused, that that of first you/he/she had been only a collapse, to which the girl, tried hopelessly to set remedy. 
«How you love he/she anchors him/it? How do you do to say that loves yourself and that you will resolve everything? Cazzo Daf, gives you barrel all day long. Have come to the alone cafe because there is not! And I bet that he/she doesn't know him/it.» 
Dafne started over crying; those truths beaten in face lacerated her/it. 
«I don't know anything of him, Moris, nothing; you/he/she has been gotten married, then she is dead. that's all. His/her family is in Siena, but you has never introduced me them, she doesn't speak to us and I don't know why. with me you/he/she has become obsessive, as if The weres the only person of his/her whole existence, and The don'ts understand as is possible, considering that you/he/she is such to bright hand. But I love him/it Moris, I love him/it hopelessly, and I don't know whether to do for understanding.» 
Dafne went on, and more he/she spoke, more it entered the detail. It told all the doubts that you/he/she had had to the beginning to the friend, of as him you/he/she had confined their life in an impenetrable sphere of crystal, of his/her being become more and more obsessive, and of his fleeing past, been firm to the fast story of the history of Vanessa. Dafne hoped that speaking would have found a logic of it to that situation, or perhaps a solution; but in this Moris, it didn't seem quite prepared to help her/it. 
«Have to leave him/it Daf, and to tell her/it that whole dog should go to the jail! As you have done not to report him/it till now?» it said him trying to keep the calm. 
«But what cazzo say, don't even try to think him/it! Don't be for this that have spoken to you of my facts! I want only to understand whether to help him/it, to understand what it torments indeed it!» it thundered her in aggressive way. 
To that point Moris changed attitude trying not to lose over the trust of the girl. 
«You feel, tomorrow leave me the first hours of the morning to systematize two things. Then we depart for Siena and we look for the family of this guy. You talk to his/her parents and you try to understand us something; and then I hope for so much that you do a reason of it and can leave him/it.» 
Dafne was amazed; you/he/she had never thought about the idea to look for the Chellinis. In effects, that could be the only concrete way to understand what it tormented Bob and thing you/he/she could make her help him/it. Of course, reapproaching them, he would have found again the emotional stability that by now you/he/she had lost entirely. In a first moment that detective adventure was seemed her insane. Then the instinct told her that worse of so you/he/she could not go. It jumped to the neck of the friend to thank him/it. You felt motivated to the idea to go to Tuscany and, to that point, also less in guilt to have told everything to Moris. In to do him/it, he/she knew to have betrayed Bob, and he/she knew to betray him/it oltremisura invading his/her past. But it owed to try to every cost. 
Moris had asked her to sleep to his/her house but her, already torn to pieces by the senses of guilt, it refused in dry way. 
«It is always for him? Do you think that if he/she knew him/it it would beat you? I beg you Dafne, he/she thinks once about you for. It doesn't suit me that you are alone to house» without attending answer it opened the read couch. But she reached him/it. 
«It is not this. I prefer to sleep to my house because here I feel me to uneasiness, and then I don't want.» 
«Thing you don't want? Don't you want to sleep from a friend because he is a crazy person? I won't allow more than that scoundrel hurts you, that I/you/he/she am clear.» 
«I will sleep to house my Moris, and tomorrow morning I reach you to the cafe. Not do fear, are better now. You are helping a lot already me. And then I have to look for more possible references on the parents of Bob, otherwise as we find them?» concluded Dafne in reassuring way. 
Later it drew near immediately him to give an affectionate kiss on his forehead. But Moris threw back instinctively the nape handing her lips. Dafne grazed her, spaesata from what was happening. Despite everything, with greater surprise, it temporized. Left half open the eyes, and in the turn of few instants he/she succeeded in feeling its language. It stayed immovable, up to feel to softly slip her/it among the lips, that you/they by instinct invited him/it to continue. But as soon as it felt his/her hands tighten her life, Dafne it got further of release in the most total embarrassment. They looked for an instant without end. You/they could almost feel each other, the heart to beat with strength against the breast. The complexion ambrata of Dafne showed an evident blush. The air in that room was paralizzante. In complete silence they set out toward the cafe, where Dafne had left the auto. They greeted to monosyllabic, still stiffened by the uneasiness. They renewed later the appointment for the day, without the least indication to what happened. 
Once in house, Dafne resettò for an instant that absurd accident. It rummaged as a crazy person in the attempt to find something that gave her a right-hand on the parents of Bob. You/he/she had shaken, you/he/she had never made a thing of the kind. If Bob had discovered what had happened that evening you/he/she would have massacred her. It is in certain instants, the head told her that if you/he/she would be deserved him/it. The terror shook him with greater overbearance. Yet it had to hold the firm nerves and to conclude something, because that occasion he would not be soon as ripresentata. Did it have to take advantage of it; who better of the parents of Bob, would you/he/she have been able to lend her a hand to understand? Moris was right. 
Dafne perfectly remembered that Bob had brought away different scatoloni, before she transferred him. If the era always explained as a reasonable choice to create new space. At that time, while it was being troubled to look for some bond with the family of origin, he realized that in that house every trace of its past life was nonexistent; only working papers, garments and communes objects. Suddenly he/she jumped among her hands the nth cartelletta, in which it found some certificates. More than the content, the address was decisive, written on one of the envelopes. 

Roberto Chellini 
Avenue Mazzini 154 
53100, Siena 

It was what it looked for, it was certain of it. It was there that you/he/she would have found his/her relatives. 
To the eleven of the day later, Dafne and Moris were in the truck stop, when to her the jail cell rang: 
«You go in car to answer or he/she will never believe that you are at home. Cazzo is a true obsession!» 
After mezz'ora the two was again in highway, next to the exit for Siena. On the navigator, Moris had inserted the street and the civic one that Dafne had furnished him. 
When the two went down from the auto, they were seen a ladylike condominium. Dafne fell him to the bells. With immense joy and adrenalinica fear read the name of Lucio Chellini, without doubt the father of Bob. 
You turned toward Moris and lit up a cigarette. 
«Thing I tell him? How devil I have to introduce me": hi to all I am your preferred daughter-in-law"?. I don't know not even if they know that I exist.» 
«You are calm Daf, waits that someone opens the front door and salts; when you are to the plan correct sounds, you present and you ask to be able to enter. The rest will come from itself. Try to be the impudent ragazzina that worked with me! And for anything call me on the jail cell; I don't know you, but I cannot wait to return in Milan.» 
Shortly after, Dafne was in front of the door of the parents of Bob, sets that you/he/she had hoped for a long time to visit with him. And it was there instead of hidden, as a secret agent. You/he/she would be raced hurriedly away, but he/she succeeded in invoking his/her old impudence and it played. 
It opened a man of average stature, from the short white hair, ahead enough with the age. It had the air a lot of aristocrat; it removed from him the reading glasses and it observed Dafne for a pair of seconds. 
«Hi, is she the father of Roberto, true?» 
He observed her/it anchor, to that point with mistrustful expression. Dafne had the clean feeling to have picked up a crab. 
«Who looks for him/it?» 
The answer, even though raw, it gave her confirmation to be in the correct place. 
«Yes, you excuse me. The ams Dafne his/her companion. Pleasure.» 
They followed second of strong obstacle. You handed his hand, but the man didn't reciprocate, staying firm on the threshold. Dafne would have liked to sink. It pursued with a question, the least appropriate one, seen perhaps the circumstances. 
«You/he/she has spoken to you of me, by chance?» 
«Dafne. as the famous statues.» it said Mr. Lucio with air of sfottò; then it lifted the tone of the voice addressing toward the inside of the apartment,: 
«Sofia, come here! This time I don't want there to enter!» 
The man got further, leaving Dafne on the door, petrified. It heard the voices shaken from the kitchen, then of the murmurs. It seemed her to be a criminal. Something didn't go, by now it was more evident. A woman arrived from the dark and irritable air. 
«You also enter, but only for an instant, we are busy.» 
Dafne followed the woman deciding not to mention any reaction. 
«You excuse the intrusion. I passed of here for job and I have thought about coming. As I told his/her husband I am Dafne, Bob's girl. ehm. Roberto.» 
Dafne was still in the redemption, timorous to penetrate him inside that apartment. 
«And is it him that you/he/she has told her that we live here? Is it of under?» he/she asked the woman with little touch. 
«In reality me. be', it is burdens complicated. I am alone here. I wanted to make something nice for Roberto» Dafne responded with sudden courage «in short, he has spoken sometimes to me of you, in more occasions you/he/she has told me that we would have come to find you but. The wanted to understand how like The have never seen you and felt in this whole time.» 
Dafne felt him miss the strengths and fell session on the couch, despite any invitation to sit down himself/herself/themselves. 
«We besides not knowing anything of her don't know anything of Roberto. From years. And if I have to tell her/it all it doesn't interest us to clarify her nothing, because simply he for us doesn't exist. I regret for her, indeed. But we don't want to know nothing of Roberto anymore, nothing!» 
Those words were a pneumatic hammer in the head of Dafne; they were its terror that was concretized, also doing himself/herself/itself more puzzling than the expectation. 
«Because? What has happened of so much serious? You excuse the frankness, but I had realized that yours was not an idyllic relationship, and I am certain that this thing upsets him/it. she is his/her mother, and The have need to know.» 
The woman brusquely interrupted her/it. 
«Feels, to me it doesn't interest. You seem me a girl to place, therefore I deduce that if it is together us it is because you/he/she has not discovered yet of what pasta is made, otherwise you/he/she would not even have approached him/it. Is not there his/her zampino behind this visit, true?» he/she asked the woman. 
«No lady, believes me! Is Roberto in England up to next Tuesday and doesn't absolutely know anything of this thing. but is thing that The would have had to know for even not approaching him/it? In short it has a difficult character, but I love him/it. and The regrets that you don't want to try to resolve your problems. Because this separation is perhaps causing him a big discomfort, believes me» it said Dafne with depth transport. 
But the woman seemed not to be doesn't even touch some of it. 
«I repeat, I don't want to feel other. I beg her, I/you/he/she allow us alone and if it is intelligent I/you/he/she find another of it. Roberto doesn't have problems, himself is a big problem, a serious error that we would never have had to commit.» 
«But lady, Roberto is his/her child! Doesn't it even have heart for the trauma that lived? How can you/he/she speak of him to terms of error? I beg her lady, I want only to speak to her a moment, I have need to understand.» it begged Dafne. 
«Trauma? Is it now him the traumatized one? That man is alone good to cry I am set! You/he/she has had what deserved him. Feels, it doesn't even interest me to deepen. I am not well, and you/he/she is excluded that this conversation goes on. Please, goes!» 
The mother of Bob implacably conducted her/it toward the entry. 
The father of Roberto had remained in an angle looking out of the window, as if all of this didn't even touch him/it. 
«Mrs., if it changed mind Roberto and The we macaws in Milan, we cohabit in his/her old house. Even if I now believe to have understood from who has taken for some things.» 
Together with those hateful people, in that house Dafne left every hope. You/he/she had conquered an only certainty: as feared, Bob had some secret. The hardness shone through by that parents concealed something more serious of simple family incomprehensions. You/he/she had not gotten answers, going away with many more doubts of before. Is it to that point as you/he/she would have done to get clarity? And had thing brought a mother to try so much disgust above all? The only reasonable answer was that the woman knew the violent lines of his/her/their child. Yet that insensitive wickedness left her/it amazed. 
Dafne was in elevator, you/he/she was returning to the plain earth and it looked him at the mirror. You felt terribly stupid and discouraged. It seemed her to be in the impetuous vortex of a nightmare without end. You had accepted soprusi and barrel in name of the love, in the hope to help him/it, and he had lied only her the whole time. But on how many other things you/he/she had done him/it? Whether to hide her that with his/her/their parents there was total closing? 
At seven o'clock in the evening Moris and Dafne were to the cafe. When she received the call of Bob, he/she succeeded in pretending for miracle that was everything to place; it told him to be homeward for road of his and him, after his/her usual sweetness on how much it missed her and how much it desired her/it, he/she greeted her/it. Dafne raced in the bath of the place, where Moris found her/it in full hysterical crisis. A passage asked him to house. It was a cold evening of February, and in the head of the young woman, thousand questions and suppositions they thundered with insistence. 
«Perhaps it also beat his/her mother? But to that point his/her father would have reacted, don't you find? Or even you/he/she has done him and then it is degenerate. in that houses it is clear that his/her parents don't want to help me.» it hypothesized Dafne with extreme confusion. 
It seemed a defenseless child. It fixed the void. The hiccups interrupted her the breath and Moris, in its mind, it cursed Bob for as you/he/she had reduced such a special girl, for which he/she didn't succeed in understanding anymore what it tried indeed. He/she thought about the evening before, an egoist feeling himself/herself/itself in to do at that time it. You hated for having brought her/it to Siena, but at the same time you/he/she had gone as it hoped; Bob was a lunatic that his/her parents didn't even want more sentirs to name. Dafne would not now have been able to be together us anymore. But a sentence of her, interrupted of hit this conviction of his. 
«Moris I don't know him/it, am I magnifying her/it too much perhaps. after all thing The have felt? Two ill-mannered that deny his/her child? If you/they had had so much to tell me because you/they have not done him? I will tell more you, the relationship with that two enters it something with its uncontrollable anger. certain parents succeed in ruining the people Moris, it is to datum of fact.» 
«But thing cazzo you say Daf? The datum of done is that you have lost the sense behind that type! Is to put aside from everything a violent, does it check yourself at sight, and do you now know that it is also a liar. and I give you still defend him/it? Dafne returns in you, for charity! Only for every time that has beaten you would have had to leave him/it! A man that lifts the hands against a woman doesn't deserve anything!» 
«You know what there is, Moris? There be that he was right on you! You have always had in mind to sweep me, since the beginning, and he has always known him! And last night I have also had my confirmation. Do you want to separate me from him to make your sparkling rider movements, true?» 
Dafne was visibly another person; he/she also vomited wickedness to hold his/her Bob in the reason, estranging from her whatever possibility to accept the failure of that history. 
«You don't even deserve an answer» it said Moris going away and beating the door. The run of Dafne was useless in the attempt to stop him/it. 
That house, without not even Moris, it seemed her a jail of sadness and loneliness. It voided a bottle of bitterness, collassando alone in the couch. To the morning you/he/she woke up by the jail cell: it was Marta, a colleague of the agency, that the churches how come you/he/she was not introduced in the office. Dafne arrancò some a little believable excuse. To the three calls of Bob of the time of lunch, he/she didn't answer. He was not worried granché; he/she knew her/it to the job, surely taken by some urgent matter. A message left her. Dafne was it pours again on the couch. At two o'clock in the afternoon he/she wrote a message to Bob, inviting to call him/it after back you are her, because the man day was frantic. It went to make himself/herself/themselves a long shower. It had to stay shiny, it had to organize all of his/her ideas, to apologize himself/herself/themselves with Moris and to understand whether to do with Bob. How was it able silent star and riabbracciare his/her man as nothing happened? And how many kicks would have taken if had told him him? 
Before stopping by Moris, Dafne brought him from the physician, to have a certificate to bring to the job and to ask a strong tranquilizer. 
In the late afternoon of that cloudy and I cool Friday 17, Dafne it entered to the cafe; last solo two boys to the counter, one of which, the most trusted friend of Moris, Daniel. 
«Hi Dani, is Moris in the back?» 
«No there is not. you/he/she has told me that it has appointments for to couple of days. I deal me with all self! Has not you/he/she told you him last night?» 
«I already knew about his/her appointments, but I believed to still do in time to find him/it; nothing, will try ago on the jail cell, thanks thousand, hi!» 
Dafne left the cafe, with the air of a person extremely disappointed that it strove him not to give to see him/it. It was strange, Moris would never have delegated the management of the cafe for two whole days, even to Daniel. It didn't dare call him/it, but it feared something had happened. 
After having strolled about for half Milan, been decided to reach the trilocale of the friend. Moris was in the house. 
When if it found her/it before, it hardly looked at her/it in the eyes. After the first seconds of embarrassment Dafne jumped to his neck, imploring to forgive her/it to it and excusing himself/herself/itself for the horrible things that you/he/she had told him. Moris stopped her/it, pronouncing closed the accident and accepting the excuses. Dafne noticed that the friend had been cold and unfriendly, as if excusing had done only her her a favor. This thing did her/it go crazy. All of this that concerned Bob seemed frozen in an angolino; at that time he/she wanted that Moris forgave indeed her, he/she wanted that the things returned as before. You/he/she would not have been able anymore by now to hold up alone that situation, and with Moris it felt to lose the only true friend. 
«Perhaps it is the case that goes, you will be busy thousand things» it said her desolate. 
«They are at home because it didn't suit me to work; I was incazzato, embittered, I thought indeed that between me and you there pits a beautiful relationship, but after your words of yesterday I have understood that it was everything lived in air.» he responded, while it was recovering and it folded up burdens shed suits in stay. 
«You are not to the cafe for our quarrel?» churches her with surprised air. 
«You have reduced her to a healthy desire to sweep, but I assure you that have not understood really nothing of me, nothing! Whoever to my place would have told you to leave him/it. From you waited me instead for you an applause? Or do you want that I/you/he/she come to pick him/it up in the airport with the festoons?» it released him from her and it returned to rearrange. 
«I hope to understand soon what I have not understood Moris. As it regards Bob. The don'ts know what The wills I give, but The know that The love him/it, only this.» 
It abandoned the apartment. He immediately directed him toward the door but it didn't do anything, he/she let her/it go. 
The evening later Dafne was on the couch, looking at Mullholland Drive, a film of his/her preferred director, David Lynch. It loved the sense onirico and to lines twisted of his/her films; his/her mind it wandered, scene after scene, and it morbidly needed at that time it. 
The bell of house brutally brought her/it to the real world. Pits it was convinced Moris, and idea liked her. But when it opened the door he/she saw entirely a different image from that that you/he/she had supposed: it was a woman, tall and extraordinarily beautiful. The long dark head of hair was impeccable. The green eyes were marked by a clear eyeshadow the fleshy lips underlined by a more intense color. He/she wore an adherent coat that drew her sides, a pant to low life and a shirt of silk from the pronounced collar. The redemption of house was flooded in an instant of an intense perfume. 
Dafne looked her/it at a pair of seconds, bewitched by his/her impeccable elegance. 
«Dafne, true?» he/she asked the woman, a glove removing himself/herself/itself. 
«Yes, but. her who is, gives you excuse?» he/she asked suspicious Dafne. 
«No, we don't know each other. Can I enter? I swear you that I am not armed and I don't want to sell you void.» 
Dafne winked, despite the wisecrack you/he/she had not distracted her from the mystery of who pits that woman. While he/she was still wondering how come an extraneous falls her in the house, the woman was already made road inside the residence. It was very sure of itself. It possessed ways and gait gifts. Dafne again tried to understand. 
«Allows me, can I understand who is and thing wants before entering to my house?» 
«Certain! Even if I have to admit that it is some embarrassing. however, Vanessa Ansaldo, to like.» 
Dafne stepped backwards turning pale rapidly, up to when it was found with the shoulders to the wall; only anchored to the wall he/she succeeded in standing up himself/herself/themselves standing. Vanessa went toward her, worried for the reaction of the girl. 
«No, not to approach you! Be me distant!» it howled bewildered Dafne. 
«Forgive me Dafne, but now I am me that I want to understand. My name is not you new, correct? Excuse if I seem you insensitive, but I would like to know what you/he/she has told you of me. What an I am ex furious wife? A murderess? You know, a reaction a tantino seems me excessive yours.» 
«Dead.» it whispered Dafne beginning to breathe to work. 
«Thing? What are you saying? Do you want that I/you/he/she take some water?» 
Dafne made him drive from the woman toward the couch. The head was as flood of air, a prickle stopped her the stomach and the limbs, as if you/they had just quartered her. It didn't understand, he/she didn't want to understand; once sat, he/she again jumped standing, getting further the woman with violence. 
«You are. you macaws her/it. wife?» he/she asked Dafne stammering. 
«Ex wife. And don't you know which effort both for me to return in this house. but that it means the sentence that you have said first?» 
Dafne he allowed to fall in earth beginning to cry without behavior. Vanessa remained of plaster in front of a similar crisis. But he/she was even more amazed when he/she heard what Dafne it howled desperate: 
«As you/he/she has been able? What does it mean? You were dead! Have you understood? Dead! He cried, it was everything true. What does it mean everything this? Who are?» the agonizing tears didn't allow her to continue, but Vanessa had understood, you/he/she had perfectly understood all. 
«Now calmed, I pray you, and tell me that you don't say seriously» it cordially said the woman, even though shocked. 
«Leave me alone, do leave me alone. thing you want from me, who macaws? Is it a true joke?» 
«He/she listens to Dafne, I/you/they are shocked how much you, believe me; I thought that you/he/she had told you thousand lies on my account, or that you/he/she had not told you really nothing. But I could ever imagine a thing of the genere.è gone crazy entirely!» 
«Because you are then here after this whole time? What do you want from me? Or did you look for him?» he/she asked Dafne with air schifata. 
«You are crazy? I/you/they have been out here more than a hour to verify out of town indeed me that pits. Sofia has called me the other day, not as soon as you have gone away from their house. You/he/she has treated badly you and you/he/she has been sorry; but he/she wanted to understand the why of your visit, and taken by the desperation you/he/she has asked my help. Roberto is a monster Dafne, a man of whom I/you/they have freed to work. And the same is worth for them. I have left Italy to free me of him, and now suit in Switzerland. You have to tell me everything Dafne, now I am me that I want to understand.» 
The story of Dafne was long and weary. Vanessa held her hand; to lines it nervously walked in to listen to the aspects of that history. It was aghast listening you her of Roberto and the history of his presumed and false death. 
Then it was the time of the story of Vanessa; some things coincided with the version of Bob. You/they were gotten married and beloved a lot. But the version of the facts changed after a few times, when Bob began to abuse her/it. 
«It was the hell Dafne. Also with me it began from a normal jealousy as you have told me you. The bright life that has described you, it shone only for him. It is not true that have lived together with Milan. Our life of couple is initiated and ended in Tuscany. When I have left him I came here; he followed me and he/she bought this house. it didn't accept the end of our marriage. Took Sofia my parts, were very objective. It sustained my decision to go away of house, it said that I deserved more. And it is not to find effortless a mother-in-law of the kind, believe me.» 
Vanessa took back breath, looking out of the window for some second. 
«When you have left him?» he/she asked Dafne. 
«In the' 97. But only in the' 99, the year of mine" tragic death", I have gotten the divorce. It followed me, it tormented me, you/he/she had come even to threaten me. But not only. An evening I came here to spit him in face my tiredness my nausea. He for all answer misused of me. It held me segregated for a whole night as a dog. Only to think is badly us.» 
«As you have done to free you?» he/she asked Dafne, horrified by what you/he/she was listening. 
«I succeeded in striking him/it and to race away, looking for help; I don't even know me as. But out I didn't call once anybody. Definite that would be alone run away, this time far, to the sure one. I went to Switzerland and I kept in touch with the parents of Roberto, the only ones to which I told of that night. Once to the sure one I blackmailed him/it: if you/he/she had not signed me the documents for the divorce, I would have gone right-hand to the police. Do you understand because the mother of Roberto was so incattivita?» 
Dafne was tense, shaken; it began to feel himself/herself/themselves in serious danger. Yet something of Vanessa upset her/it. 
«To be affixed here from Switzerland it is your way of doing him her to pay? Because I find it hard to explain me this sudden interest in my comparisons.» churches Dafne with to strange, shiny distrust. 
«No Dafne. You have been you to look for some truths and me I/you/they have come only to tell you her, considering that his/her parents don't have the strength anymore of it. Rather, I wonder me how come to want anchors him/it to help and to bear. You are so young.» it said Vanessa with prickly tone. 
«Because I loved him/it. The wills be crazy but it is this way. But you rather, as have you been able to decide to leave him/it and not to report a real sequestration? Rather he/she leaves alone, it doesn't interest me to know other. I want to remain alone, I don't want to speak of nothing anymore. I have to abandon this place before going crazy entirely!» it said despaired Dafne. 
«It won't be enough for you to leave the house Dafne, trusted» Vanessa uttered in definite tone. But Dafne responded her as many resolved. 
«I don't know to your times, but now it is a teacher and an advertising of relief. Have a certain position that for him is everything, and won't jeopardize her/it to make cazzate! And if it will do him/it, I kill him/it with my hands. The won'ts wait for burdens two years as you!» Dafne hysterically responded. 
«Dafne, every time that has beaten you and you/he/she has misused of you, you/he/she has done something that had to not be done, and its career won't be certain to stop him/it. The same will succeed to torment you. Think well of us. If stay in the parts, that man will say and will try everything! You would be the second failure. It is sick!» it replied Vanessa, shaking himself/herself/itself as if the thing intensely concerned still her. 
«Vanessa, thanks you to have told me everything, you have done what you owed but now enough, I pray you. Tonight I have seen a ghost, and my life is completely destroyed. I cannot bear more other» concluded Dafne bringing himself/herself/itself toward the door. 
Vanessa dismissed him with the extreme elegance with which you/he/she had arrived. 
Dafne that evening smoked about ten cigarettes and voided varied glasses; he/she wanted to forget everything, it felt him die. To you treat he/she believed to dream. You/he/she had just seen what had always believed a premature dead body. Vanessa had been for her the competition, the memory, the first great love of Bob and his/her greater suffering; you/he/she had been all of this that he had made her believe. 
To the morning it made a long bath. It kept on rubbing himself/herself/themselves with the sponge up to hurt himself/herself/themselves; he/she wanted to cancel Bob from his/her body, from his/her soul, to wash him from every single perfume of that house. It hurt. By now he/she knew enough, that day had to think about thing to do of its life. Definite that for the time being it was necessary to return from his/her parents. Also fearing that choice, he/she knew not to have alternatives. It needed a sure place and immediately available, above all for the first days. 
While it was opening the closet to wear something, it felt to play to the door. He/she quickly wore a bathrobe and runs to open: it was Moris with the breakfast. Dafne tightened him/it strong, so much to hurt him. It bursted in tears and it told everything, entrusting anchors him of his only true friend. 
«I already know thing you will tell me, but I won't report him/it. The pray you help to bring away me my things, The wills be well. I will go from mine for some and in the meantime I will try to speak to him. I have to make him/it Moris. I don't succeed in doing me of it a reason yet, it is too much everything absurdity, a nightmare.» 
Dafne put on the head among the hands, with immense discouragement. 
«Have only to promise me that will see him/it in a public place, not here and otherwise I kill not alone it with my hands Daf, I swear him/it! And you have to see to send him/it him to that country, not to favor him/it. Be sick Daffy, is a sick man! Have you now understood him? My mother, even in the worse one of the films I have felt things of the kind!» 
You softly caressed him/it, it didn't say anything. They remained embraced on the couch, with Dafne that kept on crying, asking to the friend because the same happening a thing of the kind. Its mind was so shaken not to be succeeded in some way in finding peace. More time passed, more it realized what happened. Moris had not responded, you/he/she could tighten only her and to make to feel her/it to the sure one. He/she anchors in tears, took Dafne his/her hand, gently bringing him her to the mouth and beginning to kiss her/it. Moris was amazed, but the excitement was as much, to immediately lose the control. He/she kissed her. He loved him, you/he/she had always loved her, and in that instant, feeling to pant her/it between the tears and the sighs of that agitated kisses, it understood that you/he/she had always desired to make the love with her, to feel her/it his/her, to have her/it. 
Dafne began to open him the shirt, while with extreme heat it kept on kissing him/it. Moris was tormented. You/he/she would have done instantly her his/her, but it hated the idea that happened in a moment of the kind. It was not so that you/he/she had imagined him/it. 
«No Daf, prays you. The pray you stop her/it» it told her brusquely getting further her/it. 
«Because Moris, doesn't desire me? I feel that you want me» it said her again trying to unthread him the shirt. 
«Thing you say? Certainly that I desire you, and you know him/it» it said him, almost bewitched «I desire you to die, but you are you that you don't want indeed me. You do only it for desperation, because you feel yourself alone. I don't want to reduce everything to an occasional sweep of which you immediately would repent, because I believe. The believe to love you. I believe to always have you beloved, from the first time that I have seen you. And hate to tell you that perhaps Bob is the first one to have I happen him/it.» 
To the sound of those words, the eyes were shelled her by the amazement. In reality, in his/her cuor, you/he/she had already realized him, but to feel made him/it a whole other effect. He/she didn't want to make to suffer him/it, but in that precise instant he/she wanted only to go on and to make the love. It was all of this that he/she knew. 
«Then you make the love with me, without thinking. I am in the abyss, I don't know anything. but The know that now The wants to be with you, and The know that it would make me be well.» 
After those words the bathrobe unthread him being naked among its braccias. He looked toward the ceiling, in the attempt to become distracted himself/herself/themselves and to take time, but when it felt the delicate breast of Dafne next to the face, Moris it overwhelmed her/it impetuous. 
A pair of hours later she slept deeply, exhausted because of that extremely difficult days. Moris was awake, perfectly conscious that that naked body doesn't be belong for a long time him, and that perhaps its soul and its heart you/he/she would never have had them. It tried to intensely enjoy himself/herself/themselves that instants, in which it was able he/she anchors to touch her/it and to admire her/it in his/her defenseless shine. 
When Dafne opened the eyes he there was not; it made an express turn of the house, but of Moris not even the shade. It hoped to find a ticket, but he/she again remained disappointed. Because andar street in that way? After a few times it was ready to go out; you/he/she would have gone from his, then in the cafe. 
Once open on the door, of forehead Moris was found, that was about to play: 
«There is out the van of the cafe with about ten scatoloni. The bring you them inside and I give you it decides which to use, ok?» 
Dafne was disappointed by that cold attitude and detached; suddenly they returned her to the mind the words of Moris of some hour before and he/she also remembered his/her own superficiality in to treat the thing. He had confessed her to love her and her, without a minimum of respect, you/he/she had reduced all to his/her selfish physical desire. Once in house, it thanked him/it for the scatolonis and then it grabbed him/it for a hand: 
«First you have told me some stupendous things; I will be seemed you a crazy person nymphomaniac, but I wanted only to tell you that those things I have felt her and I remember her to me.» the back of the hand kissed him, affectionately. 
«It was not the moment for some declarations, but I didn't want that I still believed that wanted only some sex.» 
«Moris I have never believed him! Never! That time I wanted only to hurt you. The wases angry with the world and with you that you tried to open me the eyes. Am crossing the hardest test of my life! Have lost the trust in myself, my thoughtlessness, has lost everything! And this me ago fear.» 
He tightened her/it. It looked at her with sweetness, caressing her long hair. 
«Not to fear, doesn't have him with you; you/he/she has been stupendous, and first you/he/she is cost me a lot of work to ignore you. But I know that it is not my moment. I will be nearby you. To have the most beautiful thing has been that has ever happened me. In the last days I was confused: I always thought of you, too much you missed me. But you now have to think only about putting again together the pieces, and to protect you from that bastard. The rest can wait. 


Speaking of a new life 
It was the first March 2006. 
From three days the jail cell of Dafne resulted out. Bob had called even the agency where he worked. 
«I regret Mr. Chellini, Dafne has given the resignations two days needle.» 
Bob began to understand that its fears were founded, and that Dafne had taken advantage of his/her absence for some whim. 
In the meantime she had returned from his/her parents; it was unbelievable as that place, that had oppressed her for years, a sure and pleasant nest you/he/she was revealed suddenly. Also to stretch the laundry with his/her/their mother, seemed the experience more appagantes that you/he/she could happen her. 
«Beginning to look for something, needs tomorrow a job, and then I will return to the old place read in lease. In spring it is simpler to find him/it, because they end the courses in the universities» it told his/her mother. 
«When you will decide yourself to tell me thing has happened with that your Roberto? You/he/she cannot have been ended for the evening to the morning. You have also left the job. Would I like to understand if it is the spring or there is under something?» 
«Mother you had promised him. No questions. I am badly now and I want only to forget. And remembers, for that man I am dead, here doesn't have to enter! Never!» 
«It is all right, it is all right, I wanted only to understand that heck has happened of so serious.» 
Before getting further it turned and with affectionate tone he/she again spoke exceptionally to her. 
«However you do with calm for the house; here nobody races behind you. Rather it is a miracle that you have considered us, once so much.» 
That fanatical vittimismo of his/her/their mother had always sent her in beast, but this time it slipped her I set with a smile; after having known the true wickedness, you/he/she had understood that in the life some things are not then the end of the world. Rather it appreciated the notable effort of the woman to communicate, I cut her, even though to his/her way. 
The day later Bob would have returned. Dafne had not decided anything yet; it spent the night without closing eye. To the seven of the morning he prepared; it jumped on board of his old compact car, directing himself/herself/itself to Linate. 
Attended a hour. The longest time of his/her life. The flight of Bob was late. Dafne thought that if you/he/she had not been for the other passengers, you/he/she would have learned more gladly than the fall of that airplane. 
At 10.30 o'clock around, the looks of Bob and Dafne were crossed, freezing him and making to palpitate her in a mixture of anger and fear. He/she knew that in that place there was until too people for a madman scene. You/he/she would have spoken to him in front of places of block, passengers and pilots that went on and back. That place was sure, but later what was about to tell him, its life would not be more perhaps it is. Yet it drew near him with air of challenge. He anticipated him, speaking for first. 
«Thing has happened? Do you have idea of as I have worked in these days to your cause? You will have to be convincing Daf. We go to the car» it enunciated with tense air. 
«No Roberto, won't go from any part. We won't make a cazzo of that that you want you anymore. It now suits you to be calm and to listen well to me: I know everything, everything how much of Vanessa. To be a dead body I have found her a crash!» 
Bob looked around with anxious air, careful; you/he/she showily turned pale, you/he/she was suffering. It grew loose the tie with gestures scoordinati and confused; it began to sweat cold. You started over speaking, little surprised by that reaction. 
«I won't do her/it long: you have to forget you that I exist; for you I am dead. dead indeed, in my houses. Don't approach yourself to none of my knowledge, not to try to look for me and you are away from me. If only I see your face from some part where you/he/she should not be, I will go right-hand to the police and I will say everything how much. I/you/they are also prepared to kill you with my hands. Tuneless that I wait two years to react before. Have already stolen me the most beautiful years, but is now ended! Have you understood me Bob? Ended!» 
You/he/she had vomited him all I set in an instant, without fear, without it howls, but with decision. In to see him/it so impotent, the whole suffering you/he/she was carburized in warm safety, all that that had lost for years. Bob was immovable, you/he/she nervously touched him the hair and you/he/she continued to loosen the tie; you/he/she was in full crisis of anxiety, its world built on the fear and on the lies had just collapsed him I set. He/she hardly succeeded to bofonchiare some word. 
«You/he/she has returned? Has you/he/she come to ruin me the life again?» 
«Not to speak of her! And not to ask a cazzo! It doesn't have to interest you. Now salts around first taxi and you disappear, and he/she remembers what I have told you Bob: to the before you do, I make you beat this time in the jail!» 
In to say the look it turned him/it toward two agents of the police that passed of there; the message was clearer than the same sun. Bob looked at her/it with anger and desperation, then you/he/she understood that you/he/she could not afford him/it and you/he/she lowered the draught, a possibility begging of you/he/she replies. 
«I love you Daf, you know him/it. You have to give me way of explaining you everything. It is for this that I lately was going crazy; it is everything legacy to her. I have to understand Daf, and I cannot lose you. This time I would not make her/it.» 
«You want to understand? You are only a crazy person if you think that I will still listen to dirty lies. End of the theater Mr. Chellini. It goes to the hell!» 
Dafne disappeared among the crowd without turning himself/herself/themselves. 
It was fierce of herself. You/he/she had treated him as it deserved. It climbed in car and it leaned the head on the steering wheel; unloaded the adrenaline been granted a weeping liberatorio, then Moris suddenly came to mind. It had immediately to tell him thing you/he/she had been able to do. He would have been very proud and this idea, unexpectedly excited her/it. 
Reaches the cafe he/she took Moris by the hand, conducting him/it in the back. It told him everything in a sol breath, excited for how much you/he/she had succeeded in doing. Moris lifted enthusiastically her from earth in an embrace. 
«But you won't have to lower the watch Daf, you know him/it. it is not quite said that will be only to make because you have asked him him. If you notice something strange you have to immediately call me, or to call the police. Vanessa is the living demonstration that that man can be dangerous, and I am not calm to know here it to Milan. The hopes indeed that you macaws not making to cazzata to leave him/it to free foot.» 
In to pronounce those last words, Moris had visibly shaken, it feared for the beloved woman, and it hated the idea not to be able ventiquattr'ore to be nearby her on twenty-four. You the face softly grazed him, as to reassure him/it; they were found in a situation already lived, that Dafne this time didn't want to stimulate. It didn't love him/it and it risked to delude him/it; at the same time it didn't understand that unbelievable and premature desire to refer the love with him. Its wish was weak and he was too involved for staying himself/herself/themselves. They kissed. The takings in arm leaning her/it on a piece of furniture, beginning to feel a first excitement of it. 
«Here hands not me to house.» Dafne whispered him between to kiss and the other. 
But Moris got further of release returning in itself. 
«No Daf, is not able» it said with frustration. 
«I regret Moris, I am me the fool, excuse me.» 
«You are not stupid. We desire there and it is not a guilt. However we don't have to relapse us. I don't want to expedite the times, you would repent of it and enough.» 
Dafne left the cafe containing a big desire to still cry. In the following days you/he/she would have begun to realize the lack of Bob and the whole absurdity that you/he/she had overwhelmed her. 
March went by and was one hard month. For the heart of Dafne you/they had never followed so long days. Of Bob, some sign; never a call, a visit to surprise, nothing of nothing. This made her/it serene, at the same time it played her strange. Or simply, too much beautiful to be true. 
A morning decided to call the mother of Bob. After a brief search it composed the number. He/she wanted to make sure him that him if you/he/she was not picked her/it up with them and it took advantage to make a thing that had not done yet of it: to thank to have sent her/it her Vanessa. Sofia didn't show signs of particular enthusiasm, it said only that the most correct thing had done. 
Moris had not approved that gesture, not understanding as Dafne was able only also to think about recreating a contact, even though indirect, with that man that by now it defined" animal." Among two a dead lock was created. Moris tried to forget the strong fed feeling, he/she preferred to be her near from friend rather than to lose entirely her. The job had proposed her to the cafe and her you/he/she had accepted, enthusiastic to have a second chance. You/he/she had offered her a part-time, because of other assumptions that you/he/she had had to do in the last year. Dafne succeeded in being in a serene environment and to earn us something; for her it was the maximum one in a moment of the kind. In the attempt not to think about anything and to occupy to full the day, it had ricontattato some operating ones of a social cooperative, that you/they proposed her to collaborate to some territorial projects. The cooperatives paid few, but Dafne thought that to help the other ones would have been a beautiful experience. His/her life as that of the phoenix, few revived to the time from his/her same ashes. More and more the girl realized often to give a different sense to the things, also to the smallest. It began with some doposcuolas, in which, together with the educators, it organized some laboratories of art. To April it began to bring home meals to the people in difficulty. Idea to return to make publicity nauseated her/it; the only thought remembered her the ugliest moments of its existence. 
Dafne took back pian plain possession of herself, but it was not simple; it also went to a psychologist, but as soon as the doctor began to investigate more than the due one, you/he/she put elegant to the meetings. After all, according to Dafne, nobody could enter indeed that suffering. You/he/she would have denied her, oppressed, granting her few small openings. An unbelievable strength of mind was allowing her to go on, cohabiting with the indelible memoirs of the violences, of the love that had tied her to Bob and of the bitter discovery that everything had been born on the base of absurd lies. But every now and then, inexplicably, thinking about the beautiful moments, he missed her as the air that breathed. Repressed that instants of nostalgia, buried the weakness to rediscover the anger. 
In this vortex of conflicting emotions, a lot of people would quickly be lost in the labyrinths of the depression. Dafne looked around instead him and it understood that there was still so much people with which to be able to regain the serenity, among which Moris. Also in house it was not badly. You/he/she had lived with a jailer, his/her petulant parents had become entirely bearable. 
To Dafne that new life seemed insipid, but it had the necessity to pad him and to grab on to those few certainties. 


Speaking of confusion 
In the last period, working to the cafe, to Dafne it happened to see Moris withdraw himself/herself/themselves with some client. The first time was not certain, but of a line made us case in every single occasion. Despite the certainty not to try anything and not to want other bonds, was very more serene when the attentions of that man were alone for her. 
An evening something more of a simple conversation happened with an affectionate client. To the cafe a young woman that was never sight had entered, a very fluorescent girl, in short skirt and tall heel. Not as soon as Dafne handed her the menù, the young churches of Moris. He went out of the back with radiant air; it immediately drew near for embracing the girl, that called Gloria. They gave the impression to know very well him. He/she invited her to drink something, but she specified that so you/they would have done you delay. Did Dafne observe with a lot of attention, and that state of mind bothered her/it; thing was that unbelievable desire to know who pits that girl? Because of the distraction broke a glass, and with enormous nervousness it went in the back to take broom and shovel. 
«You put the gloves before picking up the glass, I beg me» Moris recommended her, that had returned in the back to wear the jacket. 
«I didn't know what tonight you would be mancato.è Friday and there will be an unbelievable country house» he/she forcedly specified her with indifferent air. 
«Daf I know him/it, in fact it was not scheduled. It Glorifies is an old friend of family, we macaws grown together. He/she now lives in Verona, and I had not seen indeed her for so much time. It is here for an essay of music that there will be Sunday evening. Be a pianist! One aunt of mine entertains here her to Milan and therefore I take advantage to make to make her some turn of it» she explained him uninhibited. 
«Therefore will you hold her company the whole weekend? I ask you him because tomorrow, if you remember, I don't work.» 
«Calm Daf, will get by; I have asked to Sonia to make double turn.» 
Dafne deduced alone that Moris and Gloria would have spent together the whole weekend, as presumed. 
At two o'clock at night the last clients left the cafe. Dafne began to clean, Dani made box, while the other two boys, Sonia and Dimitri, cleaned the external zone. 
There was a lot of silence, they were all rather tired ones, when to the sudden one from the outside it thundered the voice of Dimitri. 
«Here is the great head! Well, where have you left her the bomb sexi? Here your supervision was not needed, you could also continue your evening!» 
«You are more and more coglione, Dimitri» Moris responded with irony entering to the cafe. 
«Forgive us boss, but this your friend had one I detach of thigh of another category! You do some the part of the sfigato to return alone here!» Dani intervened from the counter, while Dafne looked them at all and three with annoyed air. 
«You want a lot to still go on for? However, correct for information, it will have the thigh of another category but the blond platinum it is out indeed fashion.» 
After the prickly intervention of Dafne at the three was looked with dismayed air as children to which the ice cream has fallen for hardly earth. Alone took Dimitri the ball to the leap with friendly provocation. 
«But you know that if only could choose, I would be only with the redheads! Sinned that has spun never me!» 
They surrendered all to a sonorous laughter, up to when Dafne and Moris crossed the looks; they returned serious, with inexplicable embarrassment. Him taken some things and it waited that all had ended. The two was greeted and they did for going himself/herself/themselves each to his/her own auto. But Dafne returned back and reached him/it. 
«Moris, I am not sleepy. You?» 
«Ah yes? And thing you would like to do?» he/she asked her, spettinandola with nice movements. 
«I don't know him/it, you thing you have done tonight? Have you had a good time?» he/she asked Dafne in the attempt to make the tone more detached possible. 
«We have gone to a pizzeria of the center; I have brought her home toward midnight, any worldly program too much in short.» he responded fleeing. 
«Excuse and then? Do I want to say that is, thing you have done up to this time?» churches her without more reservedness. 
Moris didn't respond, simply it looked at her/it with an embarrassed smile. 
«Be'. we say that The have only brought her under house, to midnight. I had not seen indeed her for years, and you/he/she has been an impact some strange. Nothing of what however.» 
«I have understood everything. Be', me pleasure, is ago indeed a beautiful girl. Better that goes, it is slow indeed. We see us Sunday, if you are to the cafe.' night.» 
It tried to run away away, tormented by a state of mind that didn't want to make sense of himself/herself/themselves. Moris followed her/it and held back her/it. 
«Excuse but your desire to do something? I would propose to find a bakery that deprived some goodness, I still have hunger. Certainly that you are lunatic indeed, you!» 
To the four of the morning Moris and Dafne were eating a warm brioche, joking of the more and of the as two little boys. Of sudden she did him serious. 
«You have made the love?» churches without more delays. 
«Daf, me. that question is? I am me in strong embarrassment to talk to you of these things. you macaws not one friend of mines.» 
«Ok, so much I have understood» she uttered. 
«And thing you would have understood? Because know, I have not understood a cazzo instead, look at some! Because we are speaking of this? And if I/you had made sex with Gloria, thing it would change?» he/she asked Moris in annoyed tone. 
Was Dafne cross, and the unusual thing and that he/she didn't succeed to docks a true explanation; as you/he/she would have been able to give her/it to him? To think him/it with another did her/it go crazy, this it was by now evident. They were endless instants, in which Dafne extinguished entirely the rationality and reacted with the instinct. An instinct that told her to grab the face of Moris to kiss him/it. 
It was an unexpected kiss, craved for a long time by both, probably from the last time when you/they were interrupted in the back of the cafe. For him it was normal to desire her/it, it madly loved still him, perhaps more before. Instead you were spiazzata from that yearning, that would not have allowed this time to some rational thought to appease. He/she wanted him/it, he/she knew only this. It jumped to the place of guide, taking his hands and driving her with heat along his/her own body. Not succeeding in stopping himself/herself/themselves anymore, they moved him in the back seats, where they made him drag from those pleasant feelings. 
The dawn drew near with overbearance waking up a cloudy Milan. Dafne had fallen asleep. Moris would have tightened her for times, tormented by the thought that all could end, as it ends the night. Dafne opened the eyes and, after some movement to stretch the benumbed limbs, it gained a strange nostalgia in the look of the man. 
«It was so much time that I didn't feel me so protected; I am well with you, do you know him/it true?» in the face of Moris a smile stamped him to underline an immediate relief. 
«I feared that to the awakening you would be reformed. Also I am well with you, and I would not like to be with nessun'altra.» 
They abandoned to other effusions, up to that she proposed to return to take back his/her car. Comes on the place, they immediately noticed that something didn't go. Someone had broken a car window to the auto of Dafne. 
«But what devil is it?» he began, losing that few sleep that had begun to make himself/herself/themselves feel. 
«Scassatos have me the car!» Dafne exclaimed with nervousness. 
«Yes, but because to break the glass behind? Did you have something on the seats? What do I know, a purse?» 
«No, only the jacket, that is to his/her place there. But then that it means?» 
«Void Daf, will have been the usual foolish. I will do him/it mend from one friend of mine, you are calm. It checks well that there am everything and careful to the glasses.» 
The two polished up the big one. A strange silence had invaded that annoying moment. They covered the auto with a cloth of fortune that Moris had in the cafe. Then he brought her/it to house. 
«You feel Daf, tomorrow that programs you have?» churches him before leaving her/it, with the embarrassment of whom doesn't want to pose himself/herself/themselves to curious fiancé. 
«I had taken one day of vacations, but perhaps at five o'clock I will come to make opening, hoping to come upon me in the head!» it said her with air from seductive died cat. 
«Be', the head will owe first to swindle out a blonde friend fashion, even without creating diplomatic accidents. Then at four and half o'clock it will give to pick up the girl most scheming of Milan.» 
«Certain, enough that to avoid diplomatic accidents you don't have to give her some satisfies!» 
Moris was excited by the bother shown by Dafne. It was jealous of him, and this did him/it go crazy of joy. A night as that, you/he/she could change indeed everything. The kiss of regard was more passionate. 
This had distracted them both from the bad mood of a little before. If they were him/it said with clarity, but the attempt of theft was not the first thing to which you/they had thought finding the car of Dafne in that state. 

The day later, at 16.30 o'clock, Moris was in front of the house of Dafne, punctual as a clock. The two was given a kiss to die. You/they were hindered, as two little boys to the first appointment. In that new day that he/she saw together them, two nobody succeeded in making the first footstep toward more intimate gestures, almost for fear that the other one had changed mind. In reality, the night you/they were communicated only before the intention to live this thing to the day, with any intention to define her/it. Moris knew well the lived of Dafne. For him attends him to be together was seemed endless, but it was well aware that Bob was not such a distant memory. In the good and in the evil that man had disappeared from too much little. For all the doubts of the case, it was very difficult for both to understand what the correct attitude would have been once arrived to the cafe in presence of other people. 
In car you/they had spoken only of job; Moris had anticipated her that later the week would have been very binding. You was lost in the consultation of the notebook, to be able to reconcile the hours to the cafe with the job in cooperative. 
«It will be a difficult week; the neighbor I have the turn of the home meals on the other side of Milan. But I will make her/it, calm. You know, I like a lot to make company to that people, they are all so alone ones. Or I am only perhaps selfish, because the thought that is people that it has more serious problems of mine, it lifts me» he/she explained her to wander from a feeling of perennial embarrassment. 
«I am happy that you like, however I would like to ask you a thing if I am able» he responded while it was parking the auto. 
«Certain» it authorized Dafne in curious tone. 
«When you think about returning to do your true job? In short, that more creative. The ask you him because it doesn't happen me dark than to feel to speak to you of thing you want to I give indeed in the life, paintings or stuffs of the kind.» 
«Moris, does already something in the life. I work to the cafe and I follow some projects that I adore» she responded communicating a certain bother. 
«But am I happy that you are well to the cafe and with the educators. but is it what you want to keep on doing indeed? Or is it for him that you want to be distant from your true world? Because if fos..» 
Dafne didn't allow him to finish the sentence. You/he/she had gone down from the auto without not even deigning him/it of answer. To some meter it considered us, it returned back and it opened the counter. 
«Moris you don't even have to dare to name him/it. Does this have immediately to be clear since, have you understood me well? Who believe yourself to be? Have not allowed a shrink to make himself/herself/themselves my facts, and I won't allow him/it you! I am well to do what I do. And nobody will ever tell me more thing to do in the life, anybody!» 
Dafne abandoned the car again beating the door. In an only instant, Moris understood that all the miraculous progress that Dafne had done in those weeks, were pure illusion. You/he/she had succeeded only in disguising the suffering behind his/her innate grim, of which he was riappropriata. Of certain you/he/she was not facing his/her past, you/he/she was covering with sand only it, in attends him to forget him/it. Moris absolutely had to do something for her, even though in strong crisis in to decide what. Dafne had been very clear and he didn't want to lose her/it. At the same time he/she thought about the evening before, exciting and only, in which Dafne had confessed him to be jealous and to be well with him. This last thought thrilled him/it and didn't want to afford himself/herself/themselves false footsteps jeopardizing everything. 
Once in the cafe, Moris called to harvest all, before it began the cram of the appetizer of Saturday afternoon. 
«Boys, communicate well you a novelty: next week will deal there with to organize a show for the exit of a new comic strip or something of the kind. I have received the application from a small agency that has to organize her/it this morning. You/they have thought about our cafe as location. As I said first to Dafne, it will serve the maximum collaboration of everybody. We will prepare her with the direction of the owner of the agency, you will have to satisfy every application of his, as far as possible obviously. I anticipate you that from the tone is seemed me a true harpy! But it will bring us money and visibility, therefore I beg me. Monday, even if we are closed, we see us at two o'clock. It will come here with one collaborator of his.» 
During that discourse from great demanding head, Dafne had held the low head the whole time. It was reformed for the reaction spropositata of a little before, but he/she was firm in not to want to discuss anymore of his/her choices or of his/her job. It was too much a painful memory. To the solo to relive that type of discourse, even though with Moris, you/he/she had felt the stomach burn her strong. 
The afternoon went by calm. Moris had been away the whole time. The situation and the scene of Dafne made the context too embarrassed, therefore you/he/she had decided to hurry some matters that Monday would not have been able to do. Dafne always looked toward the door hoping to see to return him/it. You felt in guilt for what you/he/she had said, he/she believed to have ruined everything on to be born. At the same time, the feeling to again have problems with a man terrorized her/it. 
In evening Moris returned. Dafne immediately dragged him/it in the back. 
«You have seen your friend?» he/she nervously asked holding he/she anchors him/it for the jacket. 
«It is your way to ask it excuses me?» churches him with a smile just mentioned. 
He/she didn't leave her time to answer. Careful, it checked that nobody arrived. It opened the door on the back and it dragged Dafne in the cortiletto behind the place. It conducted her toward an angle in shade and it began to kiss her/it on the neck, then on the lips, with greater fashion always. You he allowed to overwhelm encouraging those hands that encircled her/it with uncontrollable desire. Shortly after they were forced to stay himself/herself/themselves, before it was too late. 
«I regret for today afternoon, me not.» he interrupted her/it, with to hand on the lips. 
«I know him/it. I didn't want indeed your excuses. I am me to have asked a pirla question. Do you have to be serene only, ok?» 
Moris kissed her/it anchor, before hearing the voice of Dimitri in the kitchen. 
«You don't know how much I want you Daf, but we have to reenter. I go first me.» 
At three o'clock at night the place was finally empty and systematized; the other boys greeted Moris and Dafne. The last car was still in manoeuvre in front of the place, that already the two was intents to undress himself/herself/themselves, covetous to refer the love. After some instant she was stretched out on one of the tables, gasping, while Moris stirred her above, involved as it was the first time. Dafne turned the head toward the showcase to his/her right and a masculine figure that observed them indiscriminately flowed. Blood froze her in the veins; it made a sudden leap and it got further Moris with strength, dragging him/it behind the counter. 
«There is a man! Looked us! It was immovable there, it was there!» it howled Dafne in full hysterical crisis. 
«Where Daf, where? Where have you seen him?» churches him, while it was holding her/it firm to reassure her/it. 
Moris wore the pant and brought out him to look for whatever presence in the outskirtses of the place. He/she didn't see anybody. After a few minutes it returned inside, worried for Dafne and for the reaction that had had. Locked and it began to lower all the curtains to panel, that you/they hid in an instant the sight on the outside. 
«I have seen him, I have seen him Moris, believe me, it fixed us.» 
«I believe you small, I believe you. You have only to tell me if you have recognized him. Have you seen him in face Daf? Was it him?» 
«No, have not seen well him, have seen him few second and then. then The wases stretched out however. perhaps the build could be. Moris I don't know him/it, The don'ts know him/it! Do you believe pits him? Do you believe that I/you/he/she want to hurt me?» 
Dafne was stunned. 
«For what we know from Vanessa, for the fact that is a lunatic, it would not surprise me. If only had reported him/it cazzo! From the suits, tonight you sleep from me.» 
Moris knew not to have tests to go to the police, neither for that evening, neither for the damages to the car of Dafne. And he/she knew not to be able to make too pressures on the girl. Despite this the tension was made ingestibile. 



Speaking of the event 
Moris had spent the whole Sundays with Dafne. Before in the house, then in the cafe. You/he/she had reassured her the more possible. The desire to go home of Bob to break his face had been strong, but not having any certainty, Dafne had prevented him from it. That situation was not the ideal to conquer its heart. But to be her near allowed him to show her his/her love and to protect her/it. And this was already enough for him. 
Monday, as preannounced, Moris would have introduced Daylight to the boys of the cafe. Daylight was the owner of the agency for which you/they had to prepare the event. That intense working week was a good way not to think about that sad epilogue of the weekend, in which the threatening presence of Bob had fluttered around them in bossy way. Moris was embittered, because you/he/she would have liked to remember that days as the most important of his/her life. Finally the most famous" head of cazzo" of Milan, as his/her friends had always classified him/it, it loved indeed someone. In passed an only history you/he/she had approached him/it to those feelings, but you/he/she had never perceived her in so overwhelming way. Of Dafne he was in love few to few, from his/her first rispostaccia to his/her extreme grim in to do what loved. To the cafe you/he/she had always seen her work with appointment and devotion, as in the breaks, when it made a fast squirt to some abandoned client to a table. Without counting his/her seductive presence, that he/she bewitched without work with a solo movement. Dafne was that correct the woman with which the idea of a serious history didn't make so much disgust anymore. It was aware that its desires were racing too much fast, but you/he/she would not have known how to prevent him/it. 
«You are Daylight Barnini, of the DB Art-Studios. His/her agency, as I had already mentioned you, it will occupy him of the publicizing and of the throwing of a new comic strip. I/you/they have been conducted here by us by a common friend. Daylight, they is the boys that work for me.» 
Daylight made an express turn of presentations and when it touched to Dafne, they had both the feeling to be already him sights more times. It was Daylight to declare him/it for before. 
«But certain, to the courses of the school Dante Communication! You were a first year when I frequented the year of improvement as art-director.» 
Dafne made local mind and he remembered. It was amazing as his/her mind it associated that girl to a masculine face, that the materialized later him before two seconds, so much not to do in time to answer to Daylight. 
«Hi to everybody! You apologize for the delay, I am Samuel Litrico, job with her in agency.» 
You looked around quickly and its interested look stopped him on Dafne. 
«You have also recognized her you, Sam? I was her correct saying that I had already seen her to the Dante. The girl with the style an eccentric pochino!» it declared Daylight with a to do that all gained as annoying and out place. 
«Sure that remember! Dafne, correct?» 
Dafne delayed an instant, because of the unpleasant irony gathered in the intervention of Daylight. At the same time it was caught in the act by the fact that that boy remembered his/her name, considering that for three years you/they had frequented the same institute, but in different progress always. Moris interrupted all the what is suitable, timorous of the fact that Dafne could return bread for pizza bread to the rich client. 
«Cabbage, knows here you everybody! Perfect, he/she wants to say that he will work better than the expectation. Dafne is our artistic pearl; it will be precious certainly for this preparation.» 
«Yes, I would say that he will work a big good!» he/she affirmed Samuel with a sort of turned wink to Dafne, wittily noticed by Daylight. 
The two had been engaged for a long time, you/they had put on together with the times of the school. Then the things had not worked and after a few months of job together, Samuel had left her for reached limit of the patience. Daylight was still instead in love perdutamente. You have to insist a lot because he didn't abandon the job, both to hold nearby him to him, both because alone hut would have closed in little time. You were the owner of the agency, but Samuel had always been his/her operational right arm, that bright and creative, contrarily of her, that had put only us money and title. Daylight represented in the concrete one the conviction of Dafne, according to which the art and the creativeness cannot be taught. You/he/she was gone out of that school as art director, but without Samuel nothing was not worth. 
For Daylight, to find a bright and nice collaborator to the cafe as Dafne was not at all a beautiful surprise. Even Samuel had" dared" to remember its distance name of years. It was so that, found an occasion to withdraw himself/herself/themselves with the ex boy, it immediately made him notice the thing. 
«Dafne. and how as does its name remember yourself? Did you know her? You have never talked to the time of the school of it!» it thundered with inquiring tone of whom waits for an explanation that won't be well ax. 
«What question! As you same you have remembered, we have attended the same school» he responded with indifference. 
«What it means? Also I have attended the school, and the face I remembered her/it. But the name no, considering that I didn't even know her/it. Certain days it seemed a stracciona.» 
«I didn't know her/it because there has been never way, but I am be liked. It has to be a bright tipa, and its style is perfect. And not for strength in malignant sense as you intend you. You give, you extinguish the cigarette and we reenter. It is really I, like a beautiful place both the spaces and the ambientazione. The event will come well.» 
«I will tell you Sam, to me it doesn't not at all convince, it exists of sure of better. I didn't have to listen to my cousin. But by now it misses a week, and the other place has given us hole. We squeeze well these types to do something how much less decent» she responded in complaining tone, detesting Samuel for as you/he/she had changed matter and for the enthusiasm shown towards Dafne. 
«Daylight, when you speak so you disgust me» it abruptly replied him, leaving her/it on the threshold with does stunned and a cigarette consumed among the hands. 
Dafne had perceived the two on the door, while it was commenting with Moris the antipathy towards that girl. 
«Here is throwing him the histories for the sorrisetto that has done me, sure as the gold! They have been being together for the times of the school. I remind me that he was resoundingly to the leash. Poverello! As you/he/she has done to withstand all these years with a tizia of the kind? Does he seem really to the hand, don't you find?» 
«And have you noticed him for a some interest that he was to the leash?» he/she asked Moris with a smile. 
«Moristani, if I/you had wanted that boy, trusted that would be taken him/it to me. To that times I was successful my, do you know? Sinned that in the first two years I spent too much time to draw and the last year to ruin me the life!» it said her with a final grimace. 
«Well expensive Daffy. Now resetta the antipathy for Daylight and he/she only remembers that she is a client, that that is his/her boy and that we will be all happily ever after ones if you will avoid to be too much expansive with him.» 
Smiled Dafne and a kiss sent him, but before getting further it turned the head and the last happy-go-lucky comment whispered him. 
«And is it alone not to vex her that I don't have to give confidence to Samuel, true Moristani?» 
As answered a napkin it arrived to her formed into a ball in face. 
Samuel Litrico had been born to Lugano from Swiss father and Roman mother. Motives for study had brought him/it to Milan, city from which you/he/she had not wanted to detach himself/herself/themselves anymore, first for Daylight, then for the beautiful life that an Italian metropolis guaranteed in comparison to the huge sadness of many places in which oltreconfine lives. Its copywriter career had influenced a lot also. Milan, city of fashion and publicity, were to little dir a strategic capital. It was a fascinating boy on the meter and eighty; the beautiful build was the result of an adolescence devoted to the hockey. Chestnut hair was rebellious, few careful as it was to comb them. In past you/they had had between the most varied hair styles and lengths: crest to fifteen, long rasta from the eighteen to the twenty-four, for then to decidedly assume more normal semblances with the advent of the caporal most greater Daylight Barnini. With the clothing you/he/she had not gotten great results; even though a lot of parish priest, the style of Samuel remembered a lot the rough casual of the nineties, of which a some Kurt Cobain had made avant-garde. That afternoon wore a pant wide of dark fabric and a beige cardigan, that it allowed to glimpse a lines blue pole and redheads. The decisive touch certainly, above all to the eyes of Dafne, it was the showy blue foulard that the neck wound him. 
They made a fast snack for then to begin to listen to the ideas of Daylight on as to proceed for the organization of the event. 
«Sam and I will deal there with the artistic part and espositiva, while his/her employees and she you will deal you with the tied up part to the catering and the service; I want that I/you/he/she am impeccable. I would also like the details on where you will furnish you for the food and thing to make to wear Saturday evening to the waiters. He/she knows as it is, people that count will arrive, both of the book industry and of other sectors. Does it understand what I intend, Mr. Moristani?» he/she explained Daylight with to make volutamente and forcedly authoritarian. 
Dafne intervened without delay. 
«You excuse if I intervene me, being only a maid, but I believe that perhaps the part of the catering and the service you/they should not work in too isolated way in comparison to the theme and to the preparation of the evening. Do I allow me to say him/it because I believe that the good result of an event departs above all from the good union of the team, you understand what I intend?» 
«No, it is not clear» it beat vexed Daylight. 
«Be', with an example it is better perhaps. If the comic strip spoke of the world western, it would be nice that the location and the food were to theme. In short, on a theme western, would personally avoid to propose of the sushi or of the food of nouvelle cousine.» 
An instant of spine-chilling silence spread impetuous for the whole room. Dimitri and Dani were cast had a good time glances, hardly holding back the laughters, while Daylight and Moris would have struck by lightning Dafne in a second. Samuel didn't decompose him instead, and after an open smile of approval it damped the embarrassing silence. 
«Yes, I believe that Dafne has centered the point. The comic strip is a noir. I believe that I could begin to make to see you something, to decide a preparation to theme. Do you certainly have good experience on the preparation of evenings in your place, and we have the whole intention to collaborate, true Daylight?» churches looking at his ex in reconciler way. 
«I had not understood that Dafne had experience in the world of the organization of events, however we will do as you say you Sam» it thundered Daylight with the usual admiration, to lines humiliating, towards his ex. A hour later Daylight took out his series and returned in agency for an errand. 
«I put at the most there an oretta Sam. You begin to study you the possible disposition, both of the tables and of the images. It is eye not to give too held up to the waiters» it pricked Daylight trying of bacchettare Samuel. 
«That is not only a maid, if you are reporting yourself to Dafne. Of art and preparations I believe knows a lot more than what allows to intend his/her employment to the cafe» it cooled her/it him in an instant. 
«Yes, but the frequented possession the Dante doesn't do of her a graphics, an artist or other. Otherwise after all these years he/she would not work in a cafe. I wonder me as has passed the examinations» it replied Daylight with the sour tone of whom was felt disqualified in front of everybody, and above all in front of the beloved man. 
«Hi Daylight, see you later!» concluded him not to enter tiresome and sterile polemics. 
Shortly after Dafne reached Samuel, that was about to light up a cigarette behind the principal door while the auto of Daylight still maneuvered in the avenue. 
«You come in the back to smoke, I make you company. Today we are closed and it is better to hold closed the principal entry.» 
«Certain, excuse me» he responded with extreme education. 
«But of thing? You give we go» it reassured him/it her. 
Once lit up the cigarettes the two they smiled him, already knowing that the first matter of conversation would have been the great head of the agency. 
«I believe to have bothered your girl before, with my suggestion on the job of team. I didn't want to put in discussion yours or his/her competences. I don't often succeed to silent star!» 
«And because you would have owed? You have done well. Daylight loves to often underline that she is the head, and in to do it more often sins still it of conceitedness. It is a discreet graphics, but it doesn't have the humility to accept his/her limits. And however. it is not my girl, dark not.» 
«Oh excuse me. I have taken him for granted. I remembered you as couple, and to see together you. today The have brought well also to house the my usual figuraccia!» it replied Dafne, whose blush underlined the embarrassment. 
«But no, imagine, not to excuse you. You have not gone very distant there; our history was born when I have known her the first year to the Dante, and in effects you/he/she is ended one year ago only» he/she specified him to reassure her/it. 
«How beautiful that proves still to work together. It is not from everybody. Also because, from as you speak of it, I don't believe that I/you/he/she am only a break of reflection.» 
«Good observer! For me it is ended stuff. The problem is that she still hopes us. It now hangs from my lips in embarrassing way, while when we were together I didn't do a correct of it. Ended the history I was about to leave the agency, but then I have seen her so desperate that didn't want to rage. Alone you/he/she would never have done her.» 
«And do you believe that can be a definitive setup?» churches her incuriosita. 
«Absolutely no. I am waiting only that she can go alone on. You/he/she should find someone of valid that can do her from right arm. But it is not easy. Good people prefer to go to well on its way agencies. And we am gearing to work. These of the comic strip, are the first big client that we have. All it takes is in short having a strong last name to go on, and until Daylight it doesn't understand him/it.» 
«You will be her near to limit the damages!» concluded Dafne understanding the situation. 
«Yes, really this way!» Samuel nodded. 
«Are indeed a good ex! It is fortunate» it said Dafne accompanying to those words a kind smile. 

To you are her, the boys were about to greet him. Daylight and Moris established the last organizational details. 
«Mr. Moristani, has made well it looks like the precise idea on the theme of the evening, on the comic strip that we macaws launching and on how many images must be exposed. Within tomorrow evening I will choose the definitive presses. At the most Wednesday I will make her also know the precise number of guests.» 
Daylight noticed the look worried about Moris 
«The indicative number is that of which you/he/she had already spoken on the phone. I have only now to prepare the poster and the mails with the references on the location, and to hope that is not cancelled there» concluded Daylight with the last pearl that covertly he/she denigrated the cafe of Moris. 
Samuel made a grimace of disapproval and intervened, having gained the thin irony of his ex. 
«Be', if gives cancelled we will eat more!» 
Then the youth drew near to Dafne. 
«I beg me, you study some as to systematize the location. We don't have a lot of time, and unfortunately our client, besides the time, you/he/she has not given us a big budget. But I am sure that something of detail will come to mind. Idea to hang the presses in so linear way as Daylight said it doesn't make me go crazy really at all. Account on you.» 
You dismissed squeezing her eye. 
A pair of, hours later Moris found Dafne that scribbled something with dreamy air and some childish. Approaching was noticed that on the enormous sheet that had in front of itself, the girl had proposed big part of his/her cafe in a squirt. The perspective was nearly amazing, considered that the only tool to disposition of the girl was the pencil. 
«Cabbage, is already to the work! It was some that I didn't see one of it. Is it to that it serves you propose my place on that sheet, considering that before you have that real?» churches him caressing her long loosened hair. 
«Be', it serves me to see how the pictures and the presses would be in a place rather than in another. Only imagination is not enough. This way an idea is gotten more real than the ended job.» 
Smiled Moris her and it bent him to give her the kiss that was denied for the whole day, when it noticed a letter B drawn in an angle of the sheet. It was certainly one of that scribbles that the hand spontaneously traces, while you/he/she is being assembled on something. For Moris it was a true disturbance to ascertain that it unequivocally concerned a B. 
«Be', it is time to go» it thundered him, changing mind on the kiss and getting further himself/herself/itself in abrupt way. 
«What you have?» 
Dafne didn't do in time to end the question that suffered it noticed what his/her hand you/he/she had produced in that angle of the sheet. It didn't have breath for a pair of seconds, and immediately taken to cancel him/it up to tear the sheet. In a flash it reached Moris in the back. 
«I come from you tonight?» he/she asked him with guilty air. 
«It is not so that you will resolve certain things Daf. Not being is not sweeping you another, not being is not sweeping you me. This is certain! And do you know qual it is the spine-chilling thing? As have succeeded in taking me for the culo! Without speaking of as know how to take for the culo yourself! Rather waits! Do I have a more interesting question: it bothers you that your Bob has not come to look for you yet? Should you perhaps call him/it and to tell him him. excuse Bob, Khan torment he anchors me burdens? I feel me some ignored!» 
«Enough!» it howled Dafne, trying hopelessly to put an end to that river in flood of wickedness. 
«I don't know what me has passed for the head! I don't know him/it cazzo! But of sure I don't wait with anxiety that he comes to hurt me! How can you think him/it? The other evening was terrorized! You are a stupid!» 
Dafne, after so much time, you/he/she had started over sobbing in the attempt to justify something. He didn't make him pity, and it continued his/her explosion of anger, incredulous of the fact that Dafne still thought about that monster. 
«Of the evil no! But you would perhaps like that it returned from you with a good explanation and the his/her thousand" I love you." Otherwise say me as cazzo I have to explain me that your scribble of his/her initial! He/she leaves alone, I am me the coglione!» 
Without attending further answer, Moris went out of the place inviting her/it with a gesture to do the same. It quickly disappeared once out, sgommando more times and abandoning Dafne without words, in the dark rent of that path. 



Speaking of return 
That evening Dafne fixed the red ceiling of the old his/her cameretta. The lost eyes in the void shone, with bitter discouragement. The last words of Moris played again her in head, hammering her/it. Also Bob was present that evening, bossily, painfully. You/he/she had begun to remember the times of the school, the moment in which you/he/she had seen for the first time all of his/her paintings, when as two young thieves set apart him for brief passionate instants between a lesson and the other, the time that he had touched her the first time, softly grazing her/it how come anybody you/he/she had done before. Then he/she thought about Santorini and the supper to the castle. Of hit the feelings and the river of anguish arrived that only a monster had been able to give her. But the thoughts wandered fast and autonomous, and after the torment, here that again he/she saw the images of that Bob that you/he/she had loved her and course in heaven, how come any other you/he/she would have been able to do, perhaps anymore. This torture was brusquely interrupted by the beep of an upcoming sms: 

I believe both better putting aside all for an instant. My mother has had an ischemia; I have to immediately go to Mantua. I want that Dani and you bring forth everything up to that I will be away, understood the event of Saturday. I need you because it serves someone of which to blindly entrust me. 
I would not ask you him if it were important. Be I ask afresh it to dependent. 
M. 

Dafne after twenty minutes had already parked his/her Peugeot bordeaux under house of Moris. The door hardly opened it was thrown to his neck, asking him as the things they were. Moris explained that you/he/she had been an enough light ischemia, but that sights the other complications, the physicians were not pronounced yet. It had to depart for being with the family up to implored danger. 
«I can come with you.» it proposed her with sweet tone. 
«I need here you Dafne. Of Dani I trust a lot me, you/he/she can hold opens me the cafe and to manage the things of every day, but you/he/she cannot organize an event with that harpy of Daylight. I have seen you in good tuning with his/her partner, therefore you have to stay to the cafe. Excuse, has now to put away some things. Dani passes at nine and half o'clock, so it accompanies me to Mantua and then my van it is held. Of sure it will serve you.» 
«But I can bring you me in Mantua, also immediately» it replied Dafne, suppliant. 
«No Daf, Dani will come, it is already definite. I want only now to assemble me an instant and to understand what cazzo to bring me.» 
«You feel Moris, I want to talk to you, and to know what I can do for helping you; not as my head, but as the man with which.» but Moris interrupted her/it not to feel things to which you/he/she would not have believed. 
«I am as whoever it would be to my place, worried for my mother. Of we will talk to my return; now excuse me, but I don't have desire of it.» 
«You will call me?» churches her on the door, with eyes to be stolen tenderness from a fawn. 
Moris interrupted him and reached her/it on the door. 
«Certain. You now go. You immediately salt in car and close you. There is around ugly people» it said with a tone that Dafne didn't understand entirely. 
The temptation to follow her/it for the staircases and to do her/it his/her in an instant was strong indeed. It desired her, also only for a long kiss. But the anger for what had happened it held back him/it, united to the anxiety for the sick mother. 

Dafne worked very hard the first days of that week; it divided him between the cooperative and the management of the cafe. The ideas on the preparation were plentiful, and this helped him not to think about the onerous burden that its life was at that time: the serious memoirs more and more of the three preceding years, the sudden transformation of the relationship with Moris and the constant fear that something dreadful was able anchors to happen. Also the event to be organized, in certain moments, it brought back her in the time, to that frenzy that only in the agencies of communication he breathed, when all sold the soul so that the wheel of the perfect slogan and the charming spot turned to the perfection. It was a world that Dafne seemed to hate with all herself, but that at that time it oddly attracted him in whirling way, finding again that creativeness that the maid apron could not give her. 
The mother of Moris was improving, but he had already decided to stay himself/herself/themselves to Mantua up to halves the following week; you/he/she was by now official that would not have assisted to the event. 
In the meantime, for Dafne, Samuel had become by now Sammy. The boy had not been sorry at all that friendly nickname, while you/he/she had resoundingly been bothering Daylight, that hated extremely the speed with which the two socialized. 
It was the day before the event. One day to a little frantic dir. Moris had never called Dafne, otherwise from how much insured. You/they had communicated twice only through message. Despite the desire to call him/it, the girl was braked by the context, fearing to bother him or to go trouble to the family. That silence was very sad. You/he/she had gotten further the only person that did her/it be better, the only hope to overcome indeed the past, a presence that somehow you/he/she had helped her to open the eyes. 

In the first afternoon, Daylight and the other boys of the cafe they were around for Milan to choose the last preparations of the sideboard. Its almost obsessive control for the details had oddly had the upper hand on the obsessive control towards Samuel, remained to the cafe with Dafne. The two went on to work on the preparation of the place. 
«I see you thoughtful today. Is it for the mother of Moris?» the churches Samuel with interest. 
«Yes, also. We say that it is not a beautiful period for two anybody. You are a careful observer» Dafne responded for diverting from a matter that uneasiness gave her. 
«I understand, let's grant then us the cigarette of the good humor» it cut short Samuel, gathering the embarrassment. 
«You know, me incuriosisce a thing; how come Daylight doesn't turn to an organizer of events for this evening?» he/she asked Dafne to definitely change discourse. 
«Be', you/he/she had thought of us, then you/he/she has discarded the idea because he/she wanted to directly check the thing. But I believe has also been a discourse of money. As I mentioned ago you days, we don't have a big budget, and with our actual resources we cannot overdo. This event would be able it stuffed to know better to give us some space. We have to hope that comes well, however.» 
«I understand. Then it is important that he succeeds in making a good evening. We are not the exclusive place that desired Daylight, but we will put her/it all.» 
«This place is fantastic, and it is spacious. And you have been super. I hope that can be collaborated together sooner or later, even in an agency all my.» 
«Wow, is ambitious! And you do well. Personally with that world I have closed. But we go on now, there is so much to do.» 
Also that was a key that for Dafne it was better not to deepen. Samuel, also in this case, it understood that it was not the case to ask questions. It found as in Dafne a fleeing exuberant person, and this fascinated a lot him. 
«You feel Dafne, already that we are there, I want to propose you a thing for tomorrow evening. I believe that the other boys will be enough to serve. Would I like to ask to be you with me to the reception of the guests, that you say of it then? After all you have been you our organizer of events. And tomorrow I would like to introduce you as such.» 
«Be', I, don't know.» bofonchiò her. 
«In short I don't want, that you serve to drink tomorrow! Not that there is void badly of, it is your job and I respect him/it. But this evening is also your work, and I would like you to have a different role. And then it serves me someone that makes me make two laughters while Daylight he will entertain with the world. Typical of a Milanese mole-entrepreneur!» 
It bursted in a sonorous laughter. 
«Be', I believe can be done; more than to welcome, could check that everything is all right. Also Dani had mentioned me to something similar, in effects.» 
«I would say that then it is definite, you will make supervision. As you have put to evening suits?» 
The two boys would have remained for times to speak, wound by a perfect tuning. The question on the evening suit had produced a nice blow and answer with which Dafne had tried to defend his/her sobriety, above all for the mental good of Daylight. 

It came so the prophetic evening. You/they had attended names known of the world publishing and similar. That events were often a way to unite creative personality, fluorescent and parties to whatever worldly event from which to be able to also draw the least profit, that pits of rincontrare known names, to strut the look of the moment or to end photographed in some city magazine. They were all very elegant ones, I understood the waiters. Dafne had purchased for the boys something that was to theme with the colors of the evening. Also for herself you/he/she had chosen a consistent look to the circumstance. You/he/she was not allowed to convince for the evening suit, but its apparition made to turn more than few men. Red hair was tied up in a soft chignon that allowed to fall some lock on the shoulders; the long tapered legs were bandaged in a black leggings semilucido, closed after all from a boot in skin. Above an adherent gilet of the same color covered an as many adherent white sweater to short sleeves. On the left breast a label with the logo of the art cafe and the name of the comic strip. You/he/she had created and gotten the same labels for all the boys of the cafe, detail that Samuel liked a lot it. Daylight made immediately to notice that also she had thought about something of the kind, but that unfortunately you/he/she had not had material time to create him/it. 
Dafne was radiant; many men made the accounts with his/her own companions, because of the long looks to that physical. That garments, however sober, they had on her an elegant and attractive aspect. The face, despite the thousand worries, it was extended and parish priest, veiled by a dark makeup on the eyes that you/he/she put in prominence of it the look and you/he/she accented the green tones of it. 
Daylight rigorously introduced him with a dark evening suit. It checked to the exhaustion every detail, also allowing himself/herself/itself to give some retouch to the knot of the tie of Dani. Also Samuel, the ragazzone of almost a meter and ninety from the notable physicist, made its appearance in an elegant beige suit. The attempt of Daylight to repair him the tie however it was vain; the knot was loosened volutamente, to safeguard at least partly the personal style. The art cafe was unrecognizable. Dafne had the impression not to have seen together never so many crystals and mirrors all. The sideboard included every type of tartine, sweets, icings and stuzzichini. About ten bottles of wine and sparkling wine adorned the table of the drinks, together with two big bowls of glass floods of punch. At twenty o'clock many of the guests had arrived, I already understood the rich parents of Daylight, fierce as not never that his/her daughter was entering to tense leg among the agencies of I detach Milanese. The evening seemed to take off in pleasant way, and Dafne was enthusiastic of it. It often checked the jail cell in attends him that Moris called, even with the excuse to know something. But an event to a little unexpected dir was about to upset her evening, irreversibly. All began when Samuel and she, intents to converse with an eccentric painter of Turin, were brusquely interrupted by Daylight, that drew near to the with an exhilarating smile ex throwing him/it to itself. The enthusiasm of what was about to announce, he/she clouded for an instant the bother to have found again it with Dafne. 
«Cannot understand Sam, has come! Was the surprise of which have not told you nothing! Does the teacher of advertising communication remember yourself that was to the Dante? Give, that piece of man that looked at all Roberto Chellini! You/he/she has come, you/he/she has come, you come to greet him/it!» 
Dafne felt a tear to the heart, he/she didn't hear nient'altro; the buzz of the guests and every other noise disappeared. Sammy had been dragged by Daylight toward the entry. Dafne hardly read a" see you later" in the labial one of the boy. A feeling of prickle and I chill the body it invaded her. He/she only succeeded in managing the end of the conversation with the painter, excusing himself/herself/itself. You lost some instant among the crowd, stunned. Fifty-fifty room was found, frightened by the fact that at that time the view pits suddenly free up to the entry. Nobody divided her/it from what you/he/she would have seen from there to little. It was this way. He/she indiscriminately saw the elegant figure of Bob, that was about to healthy Samuel and the parents of Daylight. It was not alone. With him, some colleagues, among which Cassandra, the hateful woman for which Dafne had worked in agency and that to the times you/he/she had been motive for more than few contrasts. And it was there now with him, radiant in to make his/her entry with the advertising one more genial and beautiful than all Milan. Took Dafne some shoves, petrified as it was in front of that scene. Bob had gone there, nonchalant of the fact that that place was tied up to her. Thousand thoughts were crossing her the brain, fast, confused. He could not know that she had taken back the job to the cafe: this was the only explanation with which Dafne could make sense of such an invasion of his/her spaces from Bob. Yet he/she remembered that evening when a man had spied her while he was kissing Moris, really inside the cafe. What to think? What to believe? Everything was maddish, absurd. Dafne knew well that every single thought would be crystallized not as soon as he had noticed her. It was the first time. Later at four months would be looked almost in the eyes, again. It was June 10. The moment didn't delay to arrive. By now inside the place, Bob was systematizing a rebellious lock that escaped from the tail, him falling on the face; in to do him/it you/he/she turned him toward right and his/her hand he was paralyzed along the cheek. You/he/she had seen her. They settled for an endless instant. Dafne had the feeling that also he was not waited for to see her/it, and that you/they were trying both the same paresi. You were hated terribly, because at that time nothing overhung his/her first thought": anybody, in the good and in the evil, you/he/she would ever have looked at her in that way." It was a spine-chilling look, inexplicable, that seemed to last times. 
Then, Bob unexpectedly, lowered the look for first. Taken back the gesture to settle himself/herself/themselves the hair and him it did wide with an icy smile, hand by hand that the known faces happened him before. You didn't detach him an instant the eyes of back. Bob began some conversation, as if nothing was happened, while one of the boys drew near him with a tray full of cups of white wine. Bob refused and he directed toward the nonalcoholic ones. It was not that the scene that for Dafne was waited. You/he/she had thought thousand times about the eventuality to meet him/it, and you/he/she had seen thousand different scenes in his/her head, but nobody foresaw his/her total indifference. 
Falls there and, despite everything, he/she succeeded in not looking at her/it. Dafne raced in the bath of the personnel, on the back. You closed inside and it fixed the mirror. The eyes were red fire, blinded by tears that you/he/she could not grant in public him. It waited until you/they had not disappeared, anger risucchiate and torment. You gave a fast rinsed and the makeup was repaired. 
It checked the telephone and it found a message of Moris. Dafne quickly read him/it: good job wished her and he/she specified that you/he/she would have remained waiting for a call of end account evening, to whatever time. Dafne threw away the jail cell, thinking only that the absence of Moris had avoided a true catastrophe. As you/he/she would have reacted if you/he/she had been there? After their sentimental developments and for the convictions that Moris had, you/he/she would have been of certain a big disaster. But for divine grace he was distant, and now that situation was his. Suddenly Dafne felt the stomach burn, an intense burning, that however it didn't induce her/it to run away, as it was natural that pits. It induced her to reenter in the room, for how much herself judged him/it an absurd instinct. It had to see him/it again. 
It hardly emerged out of the back it hysterically directed him from Dani, to understand as same the restocking of the sideboard going; meanwhile it looked for Bob with the look. It located him/it after some second. He/she talked to some people. Daylight and Cassandra were around still him as vultures. After some instant, Dafne and Bob they were to the opposite parts of the table of the sideboard. An only meter. It almost felt the perfume of it, what had always inebriated her, emitted by his/her hair by his/her skin. He timidly lifted the look, once more as intense as brief. Dafne didn't succeed in bearing such an indifference. Had you/he/she been her to say to consider her/it to him dead, but as it made him to be impassive in to see her/it again? And because you/he/she was allowed to accept the invitation, also knowing that that place was nearby her so much? A river of questions they alternated him in his/her head, contradictory. Despite the whole heart it hurt her, lines missed her the breath. 
Seeing that the other boys had everything under control, Dafne it escaped the looks of Daylight and Sammy, and it slunk away out of the place for a mouthful of air. He/she didn't know if and how much you/he/she would have been able to hold up that situation and it was tormented from the doubts. She didn't even succeed in understanding what pits the most greater difficulty. It was senseless. It felt the deafening one shout of that by now meaningless party, and without realizing you/he/she was brought in the dark path that conducted to the exit retrostante of the cafe of it. A lukewarm breeze caressed her the skin and disarranged her picked hair. To a line it felt not to be alone. Bob was to the beginning of the path. Dafne stepped backwards toward the door of the back, also knowing to have left her/it closed to key. It was found with the shoulders to the wall, petrified. Bob was illuminated by the light of the flashing insignia of the cafe. Despite Dafne it was alone and defenseless, that figure was everything anything else other than threatening. He remained where it was, to a pair of meters from her. 
«Me. The didn'ts know him/it» it said with intimidated tone, how much cold. 
«Thing?» it whispered her with a thread of voice, that almost seemed a desperate hiss. 
«What the evening was here, and that you still worked there. you/they have invited me and.» 
Bob drew near, putting the hands before, as soon as he saw that she was stumbling, in the attempt to step backwards. 
«I know him/it that you are invited. It stays far!» it told her disdainful tone. 
«Dafne I pray you, I won't hurt you. I don't make her/it to see you so terrorized. Me. The have not found anybody excuse not to enter. when my colleagues have parked here before to hit you/he/she is taken me, but by now we had arrived. I/you/they are not affixed here, if it is this that you think.» 
Dafne didn't succeed in answering, amazed in to hear again his/her voice. It stayed firm against the wall, up to that he/she saw him turn himself/herself/themselves and to leave, as to reassure her/it with the facts that you/he/she would never have dared to do nothing. Just before to turn the angle it still reassured her/it: 
«Now I will ask to my friends to bring me home, I cannot stay anymore, I wanted only to tell you him.» 
But as soon as it did for turning, instinctively she braked him/it. 
«That's all? Is it alone this that you have to tell me?» it told with a knot throat. 
He for all answer returned back and it arrived nearby this time to her, as if the kept indifference during the whole evening were enfeebled in the nothing. You had again stepped backwards but he didn't take care of, and it reached her/it. 
«Thing I owe Daf to tell you? Look me with a terror that I don't want to make to try you anymore, even for an instant. I would have so so many things to tell you and to ask you.» 
The breath of Dafne was made heavy, it kept on touching himself/herself/themselves the throat, thinking that you/he/she could explode. It felt the heart pulsate anywhere, over that in the breast. 
«Gotten further! I don't even know why I am speaking to you. Besides I believe that someone is looking for you with anxiety, therefore it reenters and you end your evening. And then. it thanks God that Moris is not here, otherwise you would have made to disagreeable figures with that people, trusted!» it said with to do aggressive, fought in that absurd ambivalence not to want him/it near but to have just held back him/it. 
«You believe me Daf? I pray you! I didn't know what we would have come here, otherwise I would never have joined to them» it whispered, after being outdistanced by her than at least half meter. 
«And do tell me, because you would not have come? Mistake or have you said that you didn't know to find here me? And are you now you however, that you shiver to the thought to have met me, it is not absurd?» churches her in rhetorical way, repenting himself/herself/itself after a second of that last sentence. 
It was not able and he/she didn't want to afford himself/herself/themselves to give him importance but despite everything you/he/she was doing him/it. It was unbelievable, but its heart was strongly bothered by the fact that Bob was thinking about leaving without opposing the least resistance and that, moreover, he was excusing for having entered to the cafe. It tried everything the contrary of what a normal woman would have tried to his/her place. 
«Rather is useless, that tell other tales of the cazzo on the terror to hurt me» continued her, capsize the situation and to treat him/it as deserved «you would escape in a second because fear that the police can call from a moment to the other! Or what can do him/it whoever knows your histories. Then not to offend over my intelligence.» 
«It is useless, I could not convince anymore you of nothing. It doesn't serve to anything, to nothing!» 
Bob did for leaving and, again, before turning the angle, he turned verse of her. 
«I will never thank you enough not to have reported me after what I have made you pass.» 
The hair that the wind was bringing him with insistence on the face and it continued removed. 
«However I will spend forever a fifty-fifty life. It is to this you have to believe.» 
«NO! I am me that that will live a fottuta life fifty-fifty Bob, me! I won't love anymore in the pure and innocent way with which I have loved you. Have destroyed me the life and I don't know why! Rather I know him/it! Because you are a crazy person and the crazy persons as you you/they should be confined only!» 
You/he/she had begun to howl, nonchalant that could feel her/it someone. Dafne could not see them, but to the sound of those words his eyes were made shiny. The man began to breathe with worry. 
«I have to go. now. yes, The have to go.» 
But her to that point he was approaching. You/he/she had felt his/her sentence suddenly broken by an asthmatic breath, and in few instants he/she saw him/it breathe to work. It seemed all except a performance. You/he/she would also be killed not to stop him/it and to leave to suffer him/it as a dog. Yet it held back him/it for an arm, feeling a strong shake. Both felt her/it. He fell with the back leaned to the wall, and it grew loose the tie. 
«You feel, of there it is full of people, and perhaps it is not the case to reenter in this state. To do you some favors, be clear not! I have the responsibility of this fottuta evening» it said her with dry tone, that however it hid an inexplicable worry. 
Bob was literally leaned to the wall, as him same to collapse from a moment to the other. It visibly turned pale, and its symptoms of worry didn't fade away. It looked at her in silence, even if with breath more and more shaken. Its look was tired, but always penetrating. 
«Thing you have?» churches her with different tone totally beforehand. 
«Nothing, happens me. often lately. but it is not anything. it now stops. You owe. you have to reenter, you also go. The waits here for an instant» he responded with evident work. 
«Thing often happens you? What is it?» insistette her not understanding what it was, even if in appearance it seemed a crisis of asthma. Bob was one of the healthiest and strong men whom had ever known and in the years of their history you/he/she had never seen him so weakened. 
«Dafne you have to reenter, me. The takes burdens air and. The wills be well.» 
Dafne held correct to listen to him/it, he lifted an arm and he/she succeeded in grazing her face with the the fingers, a brief instant. You had been firm, any sign, any footstep back. It was there, so much neighbor to the man of which to be afraid, at that time weak and harmless. Two nobody held that possible moment up to mezz'ora before, but he was consuming, even if Dafne to that point damped him/it running away away. 
In to reenter, what happened of worse it was able he/she anchors to happen; it was found before Cassandra. 
«But then I had seen correct, you are you. here explained where Roberto had disappeared. Was it with you out?» in to ask him/it it looked around him looking for Bob in the immediate proximities. 
Before the girl could answer her, Cassandra noticed the label that had to the breast: 
«Ah but do you work here? Be', were not the graphics and the publicity perhaps been suitable granché to such a rebellious girl as you, true?» he/she asked with malignant tone to put her/it in difficulty. 
Bob had just reentered and with the a little regular breath still you/he/she immediately turned him to Cassandra. Dafne didn't turn him, and he/she heard only the voice of it, with a shiver. 
«Cassandra, stop her/it! If you don't regret. The would like to go home.» 
It dragged her with itself to reach Daylight and the publishers of the comic strip. Dafne, once more, he/she wanted to try everything other: anger, bother, fear. The only feeling of that moment, was instead that positive to have been defended by him, quickly. 
«What Robi has happened you, you have a face. The wases not telling her nothing of badly, however. Did I hope that this event was a diversionary, and you does yourself instead still ruin the evenings from a ragazzina. saint sky Roberto, thing you Khan ever share with that tizia? Indeed I don't understand!» it commented her without reservedness. 
«I don't have intention to talk to you of these things. If you want to remain I call a taxi. Rather I believe, that I will call him/it however, I am not very of company. And however believe me, any woman to his/her place would have borne for a long time a dog as me. you don't know anything in reality» she confessed Bob leaving Cassandra with amazed expression. 
«No Robi, excuse me, I didn't want to be intrusive. It is alone that in these months I have seen you little. And I know that it is for the end of your history. I thought that in this occasion you would have been able to take back some contacts, even to have a good time together us. You/they have looked for you this whole spring. You have refused important jobs and all for. in short, for your personal problems. You cannot allow him/it!» it forcedly told her thoughtful tone. 
«I beg you Cassandra, thanks for the evening and the hurry. I will take back prestissimo with the job, now I have to go. Here it misses the air. I call you me.» 
He/she kissed her on the cheek. Then he/she greeted all and it brought him toward the exit. 
Dafne had observed far them from. It was still disoriented to have seen Bob again, to have spoken to us and to have seen him/it in that strange state. It tried a mixture of hate and bother but at the same time it kept on hearing again his/her words, oddly satisfied not to be is him indifferent. You hated for that feeling. You/he/she could not prevent her/it. It observed Bob and every single gesture of his towards Cassandra, woman that hated and that you/he/she would have beaten gladly. Then the lies of Bob and the spine-chilling history of Vanessa came to mind. You/he/she had been able to tell that his ex wife was dead. And then the whole suffered violence. Yet the obsession returned to Bob and Cassandra, arrived together with that party. Dafne would kill himself/herself rather than to accept him/it. It didn't feel the desire to warn the woman of the possible danger, there was only the wish not to see them near. The wish that she disappeared. And he felt lifted in to see that Bob went alone away. 
Dafne brought him to the exit just before him. Bob went out with so much rapidity not to see her/it. It crossed the road directing himself/herself/itself toward the parchetto in front of the cafe. It did a phone call and him it abandoned on a bench just illuminated by a lamp-post, with the head among the hands. Dafne looked him/it on the other side of the road, more and more surprise that he didn't have the in some opportunity attitudes persecutori or insistent. It was her that accursedly tried to reach him/it, and to be I set him. It felt only perhaps like feeling himself/herself/themselves superior in comparison to him, to redeem himself/herself/themselves in to treat badly it. But all of this didn't have sense. The only sensible thing, had to be to run away the most distant possible from him. Contrarily, few footsteps you/he/she was found again to from that bench, without being made him account to have crossed. 
«You have to tell me because. Whether to choose me and to do me all this? Because Bob?» he/she asked him revealing his/her presence. 
Bob turned, frightened by the sudden apparition, incredulous that had spontaneously returned him near. A mixture of joy and amazement it ploughed the features of his/her face. 
«Daf.» 
«Answer me! And already that there six, tell me if you were you last week, to break me the auto and to spy me with Moris!» 
«But what do you say? Which auto? And to spy you where?» 
Bob had immediately abandoned the bench. It had the disturbed air. Of first I lead off it seemed a sincere reaction, but to believe in Bob, whatever pits the feeling, was very difficult by now for Dafne. You/he/she had made her believe in the death of an alive and flourishing person, without never a doubt. Then which hangs you/he/she could give to his/her own meter of judgment? Every single word of Bob would have been able to contemporarily be true and false. It was a paradoxical communication in every instant. It was impossible to be sustained, impossible to trust himself/herself/themselves. Yet the heart kept on opposing the head. But you/he/she could not give him/it for him to see. 
«Is useless! You have been able to lie me on things that he/she anchors they make me come the shivers, I don't believe in an only word anymore, to anybody your pathetic sketch from man that it falls from the clouds.» 
«I don't know indeed about thing speak Daf! To spy you where, where were you with Moris?» 
«We were here to the cafe, a night, not to pretend not of.» 
«At night?» Bob interrupted her/it. You/he/she had immediately realized that its presence in the cafe was not alone tied to the job. 
«Therefore are you ended together? It is not possible.» it commented him bringing himself/herself/itself the hands to the nape and turning himself/herself/itself. 
Dafne shivered. Lost in those accursed feelings you/he/she had made a stupid movement. If indeed Bob had not spied never her, you/he/she had now been her to tell him of Moris, putting to risk herself and the friend. He/she thought about the old scenes, to the stories of Vanessa, and it suddenly felt him in strong danger. But on the point to run away it noticed that Bob didn't do anything of this to which she was thinking. It stepped backwards on the bench, and with signs of desperation it bursted in tears, as a child. 
«But then thing you want from me? Because you are here? Leave me dead Daf as me volevi.è all useless. It is not possible, I have conducted you right-hand among his/her braccias.» it said him, lost in that sudden outlet, lacerating. 
Dafne had turned his back, with the whole intention to run away. Those words broken by the weeping had stopped her. Bob continued, with a sentence that bewildered entirely Dafne. 
«They are in care at a psychiatrist Daf, more or less from when you have gone away. He knows everything. I have submitted him my life after I have.» 
It jammed. 
«After you have. thing?» churches her being distant. 
Bob hesitated anchor, for then to calm down himself/herself/themselves, to send down the knot to the throat and to tell what was happened after the end of their history. 
«I was about to do ends her/it Daf. After you have gone. And I/you/they have gone nearby there, believe me. After having you lost I/you/they have reverted ago in depression as years. I have understood that I had to make to help me, this time indeed. You/he/she is happened late, but they say that I am able he/she anchors to live a normal life to be well. I have kept to from all to assemble only me on myself. But cazzo is hard. This was one of the first occasions in which I accepted an invitation. Without you you/he/she has been a hell. I would have had to tell you everything, to tell you of Vanessa, of Thomas and of my reaction. I would have.» 
Dafne followed those words with a lot of pathos, when a name of too much it stopped his/her attention. 
«Who Thomas would be?» it interrupted him/it disoriented. 
«What it means who would be?» he/she asked more still Bob disorientated «you. you have seen Vanessa, you have told me that you knew everything.» 
Dafne had the clean feeling that everything was unreal even more. You/he/she could not hold up other truths, lies or other details on those people. Yet, the curiosity on that Thomas was immediately invasiva. You/he/she had been being run away by that torments for few weeks, that had reentered within immediately there with all the shoes, in a vortex from herself created. A vortex that did more and more him insidious. The arrival of the taxi interrupted that moment in which both, a little, shinily he was fixing, aware that something didn't return. 
«It is the taxi that I have called. I implore you Daf I have to speak to you, I have to explain you everything, and this time are also prepared to everything to show you that is the truth! Nothing will excuse me from the fact that I have beaten you and that I have lost you for my repugnant lies. But the physicians are helping me to face my past, all it depends from there. If we could see once only us at least.» churches him, in suppliant tone. 
«I will never come from you, I won't make me tell other lies. Parish priests and be well me. Tonight you/he/she has been an accident that won't have anymore to be repeated himself/herself/themselves. It is the only sensible thing. You salt on that taxis and leave forever Bob.» 
Dafne raced away, with the strength that only the arrival of the taxi had given her. He/she didn't want to feel nothing anymore, you/he/she could not reenter in that tornados of lies and falsehood. You/he/she was finding peace with a lot of work, it had to clarify the things with Moris, to give back sense to all of his/her life. You/he/she was not set for deepening there who pits Thomas, the cares of Bob and the thousand puzzle that you/he/she was created in few less than a hour. 
When it reentered to the cafe, Cassandra struck by lightning her/it to little dir. Dafne didn't do anything, its life was also already enough complicated without adding in the cauldron a report for aggression. Definite with success that indifference gave good satisfaction. Sammy reached her/it shortly after, asking her where that whole time had disappeared. That smiling boy and of good humor always transmitted her strong trust. This way it mentioned him to have seen his again ex, and that unexpectedly you/they had spoken, being very confused from what happened. It didn't make some indication on who pits and Sammy, despite you/he/she had noticed something, in his/her extreme discretion he/she didn't ask other. It was clear that the girl would not be unbuttoned, treating himself/herself/itself of an ex teacher. It was clear also that the end of the history between Dafne and the mysterious man was giving her an intense pain. Sammy noticed that the lines of Dafne were not not at all those radiant and extended of beginning evening. 
«I hope indeed that you don't have that faccinos upset tomorrow also! I will pass in the afternoon to bring away everything. Everybody will hardly go, away I will lend you a hand to remove the big one. You have been a fabulous companion of preparation. And he/she remembers that I want to see soon some your job!» 
Dafne adored the smile of that young. It was impossible not to be infects of it. Never as that evening it felt the need of a bright face that distracted her/it. Unfortunately Daylight tore soon him to him; whining to perdifiato had convinced him/it to celebrate the result of the event in a place on the other side of Milan. A" thanks also to you" it was what succeeded in reserving to the staff of the cafe. 

They were the five of the morning and Dafne he/she wagged him in the bed of his/her small room. He/she dreamt Bob, and he/she dreamt the just departed evening. In late forenoon its eyes opened wide him. It fixed the ceiling while he/she was thinking about the nightmares of the night. Then, of sudden, a thought struck by lightning her head. You/he/she had not written to Moris. 
It was her to find one message of his, received to deep night. Moris would have returned toward the time of lunch and you/he/she would have attended her to the cafe, in the late afternoon. 



Speaking of half truths 
Dafne had extinguished the jail cell without answering to Moris, and you/he/she was inserted in shower. While water slipped her along the body, the head it kept on thinking. An only worm seemed to gnaw her brain, giving her a physical evil. He/she thought about the last words of Bob on the fact that had tried to kill himself/herself/themselves. He/she thought about his/her amazement in to know that Vanessa had told her everything, but not of a certain Thomas, that from the tone of Bob a fundamental detail was seemed. Who was Thomas and what would you/he/she have been able to change in the spine-chilling reality of the story of Vanessa? Everything? Nothing? 
Then the mind it wandered, returning back to that evening when you/he/she had met her. Dafne strove him to remember, despite the shock of that moments it still petrified her/it. You/he/she was passing in review all the words of Vanessa that he/she succeeded in remembering, but never a solo indication to that Thomas. A sentence, among so many, it kept on playing again her in head: you wanted some truths and me I/you/they have come to tell you her. It was a sentence that to that point he/she left many points of question. Dafne he felt stupid to conceive that thoughts. The words of Bob would not have had to interest her/it more; you/he/she would only have had to rest and to return to the cafe to reconcile him with Moris. 
But it otherwise went. Dafne held extinguished the jail cell and it disappeared the whole day. In that warm Sunday of June, you/he/she had taken the car and driven for different time. You/he/she had returned in a place that had visited years first with Bob; you/he/she had been one of theirs first excursions together. Is sat in shore to a clear course of water. It felt the same breeze of that day, even though warmer, and deeply more melancholy. He/she remained for times with depressed air there. After all that months point had returned and to head, or it perhaps discovered plain pian that had never moved really. Departed very other time in car, before returning in Milan. 
In the meantime, to the cafe, Moris had tried at least twenty times to call her/it. You/they were left with the whole sadness of a history that staggered on to be born; only evidence was the visceral love of Moris. The indisposition of his/her/their mother had prolonged the agony of a necessary explanation. Fifty-fifty afternoon was made alive Samuel, stranito also him that Dafne was not present. 
«When we are greeted there last night you/he/she has told me that today you/he/she would have worked. Even you/he/she has had an unforeseen event to house.» it told Sammy Moris, noticing the nervousness of it, after the nth listening of the reception office of Dafne. 
«You/he/she can give him, but it is not from her to disappear so, I/you/they are worried. Yesterday you/he/she has not called also me, yet he/she knew that I was anxious to know something» it confided Moris. 
«Calm Moris, has gone last night to the great one! You have been here all fantastic ones to the cafe. And however Dafne. be', last night you/he/she has had burdens distraction. Do you know as they are the women with an ex around, no? It will be out still phase» it admitted Sammy with naivety. 
Dafne had often spoken to him of the strong complicity that tied her/it to his/her head. And he/she didn't believe that with that sentence you/he/she would have blabbed something of so much secret. But the expression of Moris withdrew him without control. 
«Thing? Excuse but of whom speak?» he/she asked Moris with an aggressiveness that didn't succeed in appeasing, as if he/she talked to a blade hammered in the abdomen. 
Samuel had realized to be incappato in an ugly blunder, but by now you/he/she could not change rout and it was found forced to answer, trying to mend, vaguer possible staying. 
«I believe pits his there ex among the guests of last night, but I don't know other, I have understood badly even. Excuse me but I have to load the van, otherwise Daylight kills me.» 
It did to go out in the hope not to have combined some country house. But Moris stopped him/it for an arm. 
«Excuse and you you have seen him this ex? Be' you know, I care for Dafne and I would like to understand better» churches Moris, trying to fake himself/herself/themselves the more possible a protective friend and some curious. 
«In reality I have seen her go out of the cafe, perhaps for a cigarette, and behind of her his is gone out, be' an ex teacher of ours. And then they have reentered one after the other, but even mistake. After all it is normal that they were greeted, considering that it was one teacher of his.» 
«Chellini was among the guests?» 
Samuel understood that you/he/she had guessed us, and once more it felt that you/he/she was speaking too much. 
«When you/he/she has reentered I have seen her disturbed and you/he/she has spoken to me of the presence of his ex. In short I have done two, more two.» he/she explained Sammy. 
Moris was whitened. You/he/she could not believe in those words. Bob had been in his/her place and you/he/she had perhaps done her some evil. 
«And do you feel, is you/he/she seemed you that that Chellinis you/he/she had told her or done do something disagreeable, or undesirable?» he/she visibly asked anxious Moris. Samuel to that point gained that there was something more complicated of the expectation. 
«Thing you intend excuse?» 
«Nothing of detail, wanted to understand what Dafne has told you, or if even you/they have had some power on discussion» it replied Moris, nonchalant of the fact that was involving Samuel in done deprived, putting him/it to uneasiness. 
«They owe to have spoken out, and I believe more than once. But nothing serious, this no. A normal discussion among ex. You had shaken, but you/he/she has talked me to calm. You/he/she has told me to be very confused because he/she didn't see him/it from some. You/he/she was surely upset, but above all, from what I have realized, from the fact that him not the pits still indifferent as it hoped. However I believe that you should ask to her, I am making me his/her facts without knowing her/it, and it is not nice.» 
Moris seemed paralyzed, with separation and forced breath it tried to return in itself to work. 
«Already. excuse me, excuse I know much me. Do you feel Samuel, would I like that this conversation was absolutely private, you can guarantee me him?» 
«Any problem, would have had perhaps to be silent from the beginning however.» the boy answered in total embarrassment. 
«No you have me as soon as, be'. you have not said anything of what, The ams me that too much curious. The now have to escape, he/she greets Daylight.» 
After ten minutes Moris had taken a break and you/he/she was squirted homeward of Dafne. Just before to arrive us on his/her jail cell a sms it arrived: 

Hi Moris, forgive not to have reached you to me to the cafe. I had need to be alone. I have to clarify some things. I will speak of it. I will speak to you of everything. To tomorrow. 

To Moris the world collapsed I set. Dafne was well, and of this was lifted. But the revelation that sprang was even more scioccante of it; the woman that loved had need to be alone about to clarify him the ideas on Bob. You/he/she had left her while it was drawing his/her initial as an in love high school student and the evening before if n'erano been out of his/her cafe as two communes ex engaged. Prey Moris to the anxiety decided to call her/it. 
«Dafne I was in thought. And I have not understood your message. Where are you? All to place? Are you alone?» churches him to gust, without not even waiting that she ended to say" ready." 
«Moris, is well. I am drinking a coffee in the truck stop; I wanted to make alone a turn. I am exhausted. excuse me. I would have called you tomorrow» it reassured him/it her, with the air of whom would have liked to postpone the conversation. 
«Excuse Daf, but we have not seen us for a week and I hoped to see you today or to feel you last night. Doesn't something go?» he/she asked with suspicious, trying to hold back the anger that was invading him/it. 
«Moris, is well. I also care me to see soon you, but today I had need to go out of that accursed city; last night benone has gone, but there was so to do what an instant I have not had» it nervously said her. 
«I already imagine. Are you sure that nobody is forcing you to be away Daf?» 
«Moris you are calm, are they in the truck stop, do you want to come to see?» 
«You feel, in effects there is too much country house in that place, I hardly feel you. Then we feel there when you want you.» 
Moris returned to the cafe. It was by now sure that Dafne was not held back by anybody and that, incredibly, she still tried something for that man. Before its doubts of the week were correct, and a stab to the breast would have hurt him/it less. Just entered to the cafe it reached the bath to vomit. 

It was dark when the car of Dafne stopped him in an avenue to her a lot of relative. It observed with severe look the entry of the residence aldilà of the road, while it was lighting up a cigarette. The time was not realized spent from when you/he/she had begun to look at those dark windows, but they were the 22.30 when a Jeep parked near the residence. Bob had the stunned air; he wore a pant of the overall and one t-shirt dark that you/he/she marked of it particularly the wide shoulders, doing himself/herself/itself ampler on the abdomen. Before entering house, unaware to be observed, it leaned him with tense braccia to the door bending the head in low, as him same taking back breath. It labored to stand up himself/herself/themselves standing. With difficulty it opened the door and it entered. Dafne was it sues to fix that door by now dam, made suspicious by those strange movements. You/he/she was seemed him drunk. The ratiocination told her big voice to gear the march and to race away; the instinct brought her/it to go down from the auto. It kept on scrutinizing the house, stranita from the fact that any light had still turned on. You brought to the entry and it touched the handle, the door was open. Dafne found again him in the redemption of that house, to her as hostile relative as. Thousand feelings were devouring her the heart and the stomach. It advanced in the faint light and in the silence. The spaces of the saloon were cleared by a lamp of last design, that Dafne had purchased back time. It was one of that reflectors that it sent forth a weak light. Dafne began to feel a deep breath, asthmatic, the same that you/he/she had heard the evening in the path before. Bob was I pour again on the couch, with the hands on the face; you/he/she tried to check his/her respiraton, uselessly. To that point Dafne called him/it for name, to reveal his/her presence before drawing near. He jumped in sat position, her to that point him he was nearby fiondata kneeling himself/herself/itself in front of the couch. 
«Dafne. you macaws indeed you?» churches panting. 
You had taken his/her face among the hands, then the forehead had touched him, sweaty. 
«I didn't want to frighten you, the door was open. but you macaws not well» it said in to low voice. 
«I/you/they are gone out for a turn. but of to line not. The didn'ts succeed in driving anymore. The didn'ts understand anything, The feels me to die, Daf.» he responded to work, while he/she was leaving that its torch slipped among her hands. 
«These are attacks of panic, it is not true? Does your psychiatrist know him/it? Are you/they giving you filths to pick up Bob?» 
«It seems me that the heart is. coop for Daf to explode. help me, The pray you» it begged him while it was huddling him on the couch as it was to child. 
You reached him/it, it tightened him/it to the breast caressing him the face; it felt his/her uncultivated beard among the fingers. 
«You feel Bob, now tell me something of your car ride. What road have you done? I have noticed some jobs at the end of the avenue and to moments I broke me against a chart.» 
He lifted the head of hit, for how much it cost him work to estrange from that body, that you/he/she had never thought about hearing again nearby so much. But the words of Dafne strongly had him/it incuriosito and it looked at her/it, with wide open eyes, as to understand if the girl the same taking around. You remained in silence, with the air of whom waited still for an answer. After some according to him taken back his/her position, leaned on her as a newborn on the breast of his/her/their mother. It began to tell her the turn that had done. More he/she spoke, more she asked minute details on the road, on the cross cars, on the passer-bys. It is more he responded, anymore the breath returned to regulate and the cold sweats were grown weak; up to that it stopped speaking fixing the void. 
«You have studied psychotherapy in the meantime?» he/she asked Bob with a weak smile. 
«I have read something on the strategic psychotherapy, I like a lot it. Move of the attention, seems me» she responded with a half smile. 
«I am tired Daf» bofonchiò, while the eyes were made shiny «as you have done to find here you while I was being badly? Are you my angel, it is not true?» 
«I don't know what I do here us; and if I think it I become crazy. It doesn't have sense, nothing of everything this has sense. I don't try anything of that that I should try. And this doesn't have sense.» 
Bob rose and this time takings him the face of Dafne among the hands. 
«I have to explain you so many things, Daf» it pronounced with conviction. 
«How when you returned to tell me the atrocious death of your wife? God Bob, has still that same look. Anything both, as could I believe you? It is for this that doesn't have sense that I am here.» 
He felt her/it wriggle out himself/herself/themselves, as him same ending the unexpected idyll of that moment. 
«Daf you are here and cannot deny that this is an important sign! You have not been afraid. Be here with me. The know him/it not to deserve anything, but The wants to understand what Vanessa has told you and to finally tell you the whole truth! Without more lies. Don't I have anything to lose, don't you understand him/it?» 
To that point Dafne nervously walked in the living room in front of Bob, been unarmed on the couch. 
«Bob, is not alone this! Was everything rottenness! Besides your repugnant lies there have been all those.» 
Dafne arrested him, the pain him riappropriava of his/her mind, again intense; it felt him as him same going out of the effect of a narcotic that had soothed his/her pain for the last mezz'ora. It continued with firm lucidity. 
«You have made me live in a colossal deception for years! I don't know why and I don't know if I want to know him/it, but it is this way. Vanessa, your parents, your departed dirts. You have created a castle of papers, that I saw solid and strong. But what hurts is that besides the damage, I have suffered the prank of your aggressions and your anger, that I didn't deserve!» 
Dafne was allowed to fall in earth in knee, beginning to cry and to throw out, finally in front of him, months of suffering and edge anguish 
«Have never done anything to deserve everything this! I didn't deserve him/it Bob, I didn't deserve him/it. The wanted only to be happy!» 
Dafne was howling those words in a crescendo of desperation. Bob had drawn near her and you/he/she tightened her/it to itself, from behind, while she kept on shouting how much you/he/she had loved him/it, as a broken disk. Bob cried together with her, silently, aware that at that time any word would have had sense. It kept on tightening her/it, waiting himself/herself/itself that from a moment to the other she would have escaped away, again. But Dafne stayed among his/her braccias, keeping on nervously stirring up to how worn-out, it didn't have strengths and tears anymore. 
After some, Dafne was still stretched on that carpet in the middle of the saloon, with the superior part of the body among the winding braccias of Bob. He/she slept, while he caressed her the face, hoping that that moment never ended. 
At three o'clock at night Dafne had a wince. It was on the carpet with a light quilt that covered her/it. Under to the head, the soft feathers of his/her old pillow. You turned and he/she saw Bob laid down on a side, next to her, perfectly awake, that looked her/it with the intensity that only its eyes were able of to transmit. You turned him on the other side, setting himself/herself/itself in front of him. 
«I have slept a lot?» churches, still stunned. 
«Yes, they are the three.» 
Dafne had had the instinct to check that it had all the suits I set. That fear went to contrast with the innocent image that Bob had in that instant; yet, certain memoirs were engraved in his/her mind, as branded to fire. It was to few centimeters from Bob, the man that had feared to see again for months. It was the same man from which Moris protected her/it a sort of psychopath that had invented the death of a woman and you/he/she had crushed her for months. They were there now, extended to look at himself/herself/themselves. You the first evening had treated badly him and he had not done anything inconsiderate to hold back her/it. That evening had found him/it in a compassionate state and you/he/she had helped him/it. Few gestures, holding him/it among the braccias. Despite the whole wickedness lived among those walls, you/they were held narrow to story and they now looked him, aware that that silence and that peace would be ended soon. 
«They say whether to fall asleep among the braccias than is someone the sign of greater trust that can be shown» it said him, timidly touching her hair «absurd you don't find?» 
«Already. I have relieved so so much perhaps what time I am not afraid of that that could do me anymore.» 
He looked at her/it, estasiato; the ambivalence of that situation was notable, she held him/it a monster but despite everything you/he/she had slept as a baby among its braccias. 
«I can tell only you that I am trying to go out of it, to understand because those things happened and to take care of me. It hurts Daf, ago so much evil to accept to have a problem of the kind, and to have made you those things.» he/she affirmed him. 
«It is for this that you have begun to have attacks of panic?» churches her, throwing on the head and leaning himself/herself/itself on the forearm. 
«I don't know him/it, you/he/she can be. I have not talked to the psychiatrist of this thing yet. And now you are here and me. The feels I know strange. It is as if God had listened to these months' prayers.» 
It made a brief break, perceiving her occhiataccia to the word" God." 
«Not to look me so, I am not crazy! Be' not entirely» it said him mentioning a smile. 
«God? Have you begun to beg God for me? If you were mister lie 2006 I would believe you.» 
The two laughed had a good time, Dafne was stranita to have succeeded in making a wisecrack in a similar context. You/he/she had come her natural. It was stretched out of side to what had considered for a long time his/her jailer, a man that potentially it was dangerous for his/her same life, but they laughed together at that time, in the attempt to render less dramatic the enormous anguish that overhung them. They knew that of there to few you/he/she would have been necessary to make light on all of this that had happened, on the sense that had to be there, one of side to the other. And this began with a raw question of him: 
«Daf, has thing happened when I/you/they have gone to London? I have need to understand» churches with steadiness. 
«Apart to discover that your wife was alive and flourishing?» 
«Yes, apart that.» 
Dafne understood that the sarcasm was out by now place. Its expression frowned him. 
«I am afraid to speak to you of thing has happened when you were in London.» 
He grabbed his/her hands with decision and severe expression. 
«Dafne I would not do you anymore of the evil! Don't speak so I pray you! You can now tell me everything. I know him/it that I have told you thousand times that I would not have you more beaten, and punctually I relapsed there. But it belongs to the past. and it is not only to psychiatrist to give me the strength to stop. You/he/she has been your absence to make to understand me. Speak to me Daf. The pray you, trusted of me, dark ounces.» 
«And with Vanessa? Also to lose her had made you go crazy. So much to persecute her/it for two years or mistake?» 
«To persecute? I want to understand if it is alone this that has told you» churches him irritated. 
«Is clear that will deny his/her words Bob, is so obvious! I don't expect me for some that you can confirm; it is for this that to listen to sense doesn't have you!» sbottò her, going off standing. 
«No Daf, this will be the moment of the absolute truths, because as soon as will go out of was also here forever, will do him/it knowing the whole truth! I swear you him.» 
Dafne thought about the other thousand oaths of Bob and the word truth used by him, it appeared by now a contradiction on to be born. 
«You feel Bob, tell me this nth truth, without worrying you about what I know me. Even also speak to me of that Thomas, of which I don't know anything.» 
Bob to feel those smiled words, but it was a bitter smile, that withdrew him/it notably. 
«You know, I have thought there, and in effects it was from stupid to think that the paladin of the truth was remembered to speak of the detail of Thomas!» 
«Bob goes» on you/he/she specified Dafne, that had put on session in front of him tightening his/her soft pillow among the braccias. 
«Vanessa and I are married there and initially we have lived in Siena. We were not here, as I had told you me. However, the marriage, asked shortly after her to transfer us to Milan. I wanted to make career and possession of his/her/their children. But I wanted to be away from my parents, with which I have never had a normal relationship. Your incomprehensions with your parents are cavolate in comparison to the grudge that ties me to those people.» 
Bob labored to continue. It swallowed continuously, looking for a way to go on. 
«Vanessa seemed to adore them instead, they were a lot of accomplices, above all with my mother.» 
While Dafne listened to those words, he/she remembered the tone and the rigidity of the mother of Bob in the few wisecracks that you/he/she had turned her: Roberto doesn't have problems, himself is a big problem. And then it considered to the enormous hurry of Vanessa towards his/her/their ex mother-in-law: You don't have idea of thing has passed that holy woman. 
«Vanessa was very influenced by my mother, and this thing irritated me. Then, an accursed day. The returneds home before the expectation from to course of updating to Florence. And I found my wife in the house with my cousin Thomas. Half-naked, in our bed.» 
Bob had changed expression, you/he/she was visibly humiliated in to tell that detail. Dafne was devastated from I bewilder him/it. 
«Thing? What devil.» it interrupted her, with the tone of whom could not believe in those last affirmations. 
«Is this way! Are prepared to immediately go to Tuscany, together! All the people of that family of the cazzo knew him/it, also my mother knew him/it! But has not this told you him the dear Vanessa, true?» 
Bob was standing, you/he/she had leaned the head against the glass of the window. 
«How it is able a family, a mother, Bob to support a betrayal of the kind? It is impossible!» he/she asked Dafne with suspicious, timorous that those new truths were the nth depistaggio of Bob. 
«You would explain better if I told yourself that that is not my mother? I/you/they have been adopted by the Chellinis, they are not their child. I have also stolen the whole documentation, if you want to have it confirms of it. You/he/she has beaten him to me in face when I was twelve years old. You/they have adopted me when they thought about not being able to have children.» 
Dafne didn't know what to say. This time it didn't find words, neither good, bad tantomeno. 
«Then magically, when I was nine years old, my brother was born. And from that day that woman has not done anything else other than to beat me in face how much reformed was not to have left me where I was! Of hit I was the degenerate child, that that was borne hardly. I was only a vivacious little boy, she has treated me for a life as the worse one of the iniquities! And that useless man of Chellini has never done anything, succube as you/he/she is of that woman!» 
Bob had begun to cry a mixed weeping to the anger, that that story made him throw out. Dafne didn't know what to do, twisted from such revelations and at the same time frightened that Bob could have another attack of panic, or worse, of anger. In a sea of subterfuges and lies, its heart told her that that mortifying truth was authentic. 
«Bob you come here and calmed. I won't listen more otherwise to a word.» 
He reached her/it, as it was a little dog just beaten up. It looked at her dejected and after some deep breath it continued. 
«Sofia knew about Vanessa and Thomas, and you knows what it did? Did it recommend her to leave me and to make himself/herself/themselves a life with my cousin; he was with the feet for earth, was it an advisor of success, a true Chellini, understands? While I was the failure dreamer, what wanted to make art and publicity! Vanessa confessed me that between Thomas and she it had been going on for months, covered by my mother. It tried to convince me that the ideas of my mother were true, that was a deluded without feet for earth, that she needed a done man and ended.» 
«And from there thing has happened? Has you/he/she left you?» 
«No. We tried to repair the things. I was prepared to forgive her/it. We transferred there to Pisa to estrange us from that mob, but it was an useless attempt. The first time that I found her/it in bath to the jail cell I slapped her/it. It was the first time that a woman touched, and I was badly to have done him/it. You didn't respect me anymore. In the turn of few it transferred here him with him to Milan. It is true, I have persecuted her for months, I wanted that it returned on his/her footsteps. I hated her for what had done me but I didn't want to lose her/it. I felt me a failure, as my mother said. I hated the fact that he/she remained with a true Chellini, I wanted how same with me, with Roberto.» 
Bob drank some water, exhausted from that weary story. Dafne had seen a lot of him: anger, pretense, pain. But you/he/she had ever seen that devastated expression. 
«Then the drop that made to overflow the vase was the discovery that a few months had failed before. He/she almost vomited him/it to me in face with pride, hoping that so I would have left her alone. In the uncertainty that that child could be mine, Thomas and she they decided to throw him/it street, without telling me him. It is to that nth stab lost the sense Daf. I brought her in my house, in this house, and I held her/it segregated a whole night. I was a monster, a true monster, a man that that stupid of mine and she. of Sofia, you/they had contributed created to. It escaped away then and to distance of a few months it arrived to me a letter with the documents of the divorce. If I/you had not signed them you/he/she would have reported me, and it added that my mother would have testified to his/her favor. Could you/he/she be my child, do you understand? I had never been a true child, and she had removed from me the possibility to be a true father to have my ransom. I didn't have to hurt her, I didn't have not to even do him/it to you, but. The wanted to true family, The have always wanted her Daf.» 
«Bob you take a break, you drink something, I have felt enough and I want that you calm I now pray you.» 
«No, I want to end. I owe. Only my brother had a minimum of humanity in this whole matter; to his/her way you/he/she was nearby me. It is a lawyer, and it followed my divorce. The last thing that told me after the sentence is that only the time would have shown to everybody that I could be successful, that a life could refer. And that I owed star away from our mother, because that woman would never be changed. Is regretted me to lose the contacts with him, but are prepared to look for him/it, so will tell you that is everything true! I would have so desire to feel him/it Daf. but The have never had the courage.» 
Bob took a break, almost not having the strength to go over. Dafne was incredulous, it almost feared to approach him/it; but you/he/she could not leave him/it without a contact, that immediately concretized in a caress. He kissed her hand, not succeeding in checking the immense desire to feel a more intimate proximity. You to this were not ready. And taken the distances. 
«Yes, we could call him/it, but it now interests me to understand because among us you/he/she has gone this way. In the job you have shown that you are the best, and with me you would have been able to have a sentimental ransom, did I love you and I respected you, whether not to confide you with me? Because all those crazy person inventions?» 
«Daf, not to talk to the past I pray you, I cannot bear him/it!» 
Bob didn't dare to ask her if she loved him/it anchor, you/he/she feared the answer more than every other thing. 
«When I have understood that you could make indeed me try the love, I have made the accounts with my past, with my fears. Vanessa, Thomas, my child, everything! I had to restart afresh. I have decided that owed to know about the existence of Vanessa, but in our present she had to be dead, and with her I hoped to make to die all the humiliations and my inconsiderate gestures. Only telling you that it was dead you/he/she would have been a matter taboo. But then you kept on asking questions on my parents, on my past and me. The have felt in trap. There was always then that Morises present, every man and every situation they were for me a constant danger. I have poured again on you the whole hate and the whole disgust that I brought me inside, from when I/you/they were born. Abandoned by mine true mother, treated a merda by the Chellinis, his/her cousin with which he was grown my wife and her you/he/she was brought away you/he/she had killed a child that could be mine. Daf I didn't want, but I/you/they have not succeeded to.» 
Bob jammed, the silence was spine-chilling. It seemed that it had been lasting for times, then resumptions to speak, seeking a well distant calm. 
«I cannot tell you other Daf, if not that I am indeed only now ready to face all of my life. And I am also doing him/it for you, my love, for us.» 
The heart of Dafne made a wince. To hear again again those words, my love, understood that that man still possessed his/her soul. Dafne remained in silence. You/he/she was embittered by the agonizing story of Bob, but it now seemed that finally the puzzle was complete. You/he/she could not justify Bob for what had suffered, but the excuses were notably incisive. Thousand questions consumed her/it but he anticipated him. 
«They were these, the things that you knew?» churches him. 
You responded only with the expression of the face, then it specified what he/she thought. 
«Needless to say you of no. They were similar in some points, but I didn't know anything of Thomas and his/her child. The history of his/her/their child is terrible. And your mother. be', Sofia is undoubtedly to sick woman. I understand that you have lived with the constant fear of the abandonment, but I also know how much I have suffered me and. The don'ts know him/it, it is everything too confused, surreal.» 
«Dafne I know him/it, and I have not told you these things to justify me. I want only now that you believe it, I/you/he/she believe indeed it. Me enough this for now.» 
«You know that I believe you. Despite everything. It is maddish, but it is this way. And I am afraid of this, I am confused.» 
«Also I am confused my love. And this thing of Vanessa torments me. Because after all these years you/he/she has returned to ruin me the life? For some verses I am happy that has put an end to the whole farce that I had created, but because you/he/she has looked for you? And as he/she knew of you and of the fact that I/you was alone here? You moved to Switzerland with that dog. Or at least this it was the last thing that I knew me.» 
Dafne swallowed, now it was his/her turn; for how much it didn't feel him in the position to justify him, it was afraid in to tell Bob of his/her trip to Tuscany however. It picked up the ideas and it started to tell. 
«Bob, has been me to conduct her/it to me, without knowing him/it. I was tired of your scenes, of your anger; you checked my life in obsessive way, I stayed with you because my love was stronger than every other thing, but it was time to react to look for explanations that you didn't want to give me. I was confided me with Moris. He has always respected me, you/he/she has never tried to do nothing before me and we left each other to you, and this I want that I/you/he/she am clear. When I have spoken to him of as the things they went, you/he/she has come to mind that going to your parents would have been able to understand there what it upset so much you. And so I have done.» 
Bob made a grimace in sign of deep bitterness. It hid the face among the hands, left half open Dafne the eyes, in the memory of his/her violent reactions. But Bob drew near her, gaining that fear in the eyes of Dafne; he talked her to tone more checked possible. 
«You have gone to them with Moris. The don'ts want to feel other. I hate me for this. If I/you had had the strength to face certain things you would never have done him/it. And I would not have contributed to make to become that man your hero. You/he/she has brought away you from me, another time has happened. and you/he/she has been only this time my guilt.» 
Bob didn't succeed in looking at her/it anymore. Dafne oddly felt him emptied by that sudden attempt of distrust. 
«Bob is not this the point. I am not Vanessa, have never been him/it! Moris has been the only point of reference in that period. Not that I have to justify me, but I don't want him to have guilts! You/he/she has realized that I was badly and you/he/she has helped me to make things clear in the only way according to which it seemed us possible. The rest has come later.» 
«No, not to speak, prays you!» 
Bob was uneasy, you/he/she seemed that the detail of its meeting with Sofia didn't interest him/it more; at that time it felt an ardent pain in to imagine Moris with Dafne, first in Tuscany, accomplices to its shoulders, and then in bed, where you/he/she had imagined them day after day, for months. 
«I don't do what to think about you two, since yesterday evening. Dafne I don't make her/it. I have made some progress, I have trying to change and to overcome all of my failures. And I have decided to do only it because I was convinced to be able to return from you as a different man, a man able to manage his/her jealousy to manage the most beautiful thing that could happen me. But then I think about Moristani, I think about every time that I saw him/it how a threat, and to the fact that I/you was right!» 
Bob was with the face hidden among the hands, a tear slowly the worn out expression outlined him. 
«No Bob, is not this way! You have to put to place the things to put aside from me. Have you allowed too people to ruin you, and won't you be with anybody until well you won't be well with yourself, don't you understand him/it? I would never have left you for anybody, because I love you to the point to go crazy for you!» 
Dafne again poured tears, tears that despite everything they had a less bitter taste, almost liberatorio, as liberatoria had been that admission scioccante. You loved him/it anchor, you/he/she had succeeded in telling him him, to tell him him. Bob reached her/it and their faces were grazed. They kissed, with almost violent impetus, it was as if they breathed after months of apnea. They didn't understand how much that kiss lasted. Any gesture had more sense, was as if their bodies didn't feel the dimensions of the time and the space anymore. He whispered her few words, interrupted; they panted, in the deepest kiss ever existed, that had darkened those data in a whole life. 



Speaking of great decisions 
That kiss monopolized the two without truce for different time. Bob tried to abandon her/it on the carpet, but she immediately opposed a light resistance that him you/he/she respected. 
«No Bob» it murmured her, had still been twisting for that last unthinkable minutes. 
«I know him/it, excuse me. I want you to be well my love. I love you, I love you to die.» 
It kept on whispering her many others I love you before its lips returned to feel the taste of those of Dafne. The two kept on kissing him for other long instants, but as soon as they understood that the bodies passionately desired other, they stopped him. They spoke up to the dawn, Dafne had wanted to tell all the lapels of his/her visit to the Chellinis, than the visit of Vanessa and all of this had twisted her that the woman had told and omitted, explaining that already that evening, in the little lucidity of the moment, a lot of things had him stranita. Both arrived to arrange on the fact that the gesture of Vanessa had been the final revenge, probably arranged with Sofia. Then Dafne told him of his/her new cohabitation with his/her/their parents and than its suffering had reapproached them. Dafne cared to clarify that the to be kissed him it didn't define anything; stranita was too from what happened to succeed in giving him a sense. Bob understood those words, yet you/he/she seemed to push toward a common objective, in the hope that from that night a real hope was born to restart. 
«I would like that tomorrow afternoon I came with me in session Daf; I would like to talk to my physician of that that has happened, of the fact that I can try indeed and not only to words. I would like to make this walk together, it would be important for me. I will have to begin some sessions of psychotherapy, that place side by side the run from the psychiatrist. We could go from one of the strategic physicians of which you spoke first» churches him grazing her face, from the disorientated expression. 
«Bob can be made, but first I have to systematize other things; I cannot return to see you as if nothing pits. I/you/they have gone on to these months. at least The believeds» it said her, firm. 
«You report yourself to him true?» 
Bob had begun to stir for the room, as to show indifference, but at that time to hold the firm nerves was not easy. And he/she knew not to be able him to allow errors. What tied him/it to Dafne it was a thin thread, fragile, that whatever wrong gesture would have been able to break, this time forever. 
«You have to trust me Bob. Don't you understand that your anger and your jealousy have always depended on this? You would not hurt anybody if it were for your insecurities. And it won't serve to a beautiful anything go to a psychiatrist if you don't understand this. I cannot disappear from the life of Moris because now it suits me so, it would not be correct. I have to speak to him» he/she affirmed her, conscious that this time you/he/she would not have surrendered to some pressure, also seeing Bob in difficulty. He had a different look what had brought her to fall in love him of it perdutamente years before. 
«Dafne I know him/it, I know him/it! It is alone that I don't know what was born indeed among you in this period, and this terrorizes me. That man has had the fortune to have you, and he won't let you easily go so much. A maniac considers me, a crazy person that wants to do anchors yourself some evil and will convince you, I know him/it.» 
Dafne approached him/it, and it tightened him/it strong, understanding his/her enormous effort in to maintain the firm nerves and the enormous fear to again be himself/herself/themselves without her. Dafne loved him/it anchor, and it was paradoxically happy that his sad lived had partly justified his/her behavior and his/her errors. It didn't feel him ready about giving him great demonstrations, but in that precise instant you/he/she would have tried everything to make to feel him/it to the sure one. You had never forgotten the good one of their history, and you/he/she would have paid gold to return to that moments. But Moris was strongly another present thought. You/he/she had disappeared for the whole day; he/she had not seen him/it for a week and you/they were not left quite well. You/he/she had otherwise imagined their next meeting; you/they would have reconciled, you/they would have spoken of the health of his/her/their mother and you/they would be made to crush by the passion typical of a history to the dawns. But then that unpredictable event had twisted every certainty: Bob that in its incomparable attractiveness it crossed the threshold of the Art cafe and her that in to see again you/he/she had tried him/it emotions ingestibili. You/he/she had been as if that shivers of pleasure terror mixtures had relighted her. Dafne had need to feel himself/herself/themselves lives, and for how much incomprehensible was, to see that man again had wakened up her from a numbness that it didn't belong her. Then the revelations shock was followed on Vanessa and on his/her/their child, and of hit the binomial one for a long time uncertain between Moris and Dafne a dangerous triangle had become, to which the girl owed to cancel a side. This was not even more her clear as soon as Bob, still among his/her braccias, it was pronounced in dry way, brusquely dissuading her/it from his/her thousand thoughts. 
«I will trust you, my love. I know that you will succeed in forgiving me, that you will return from me. I have mistaken all with you but the feeling that I try it makes you feel long live, and I know that you succeed in feeling him/it despite the whole evil that I have done you. I will wait up to when Moristani will be out of your life. Only then.» 
It softly got further him leaving her/it amazed in the middle of the room. 
«Bob I don't believe that you are in the position to put me pressure, you don't believe?» churches her timidly. 
«No, I am not him/it. In fact the choice is yours. You still sleep some, you can go to room if you want, it is not the case to get back home to this time.» 
After those words Bob collapsed on the couch, giving the shoulders to the rest of the room, understood Dafne. 
You were amazed. It perfectly understood what Bob you/he/she had told her; those words were damnedly coherent. Perhaps the felt most normal thing that evening. Yet the girl was spiazzata. Bob had a checked attitude, almost cold. This from a side was a pleasure for her; but from the other one you/he/she was felt refused, and this did her/it go crazy. 
To the eleven of the morning Dafne he woke up. Bob was not at home. It found one ticket of his in the kitchen. 

I have left you a clean bathrobe in bath and something for the breakfast. On the table there are yours old keys. Portal with you and he/she remembers that I will wait you, always. The have called my brother. You/he/she has been the thing most difficult that has done never. But I had to do him/it, for me, for us. Udine is transferred to, I want to go to find him/it, I hope together. The love you princess. 

Smiled Dafne, suddenly a touch of happiness had pervaded her. 
Moris, had spent instead the peggior night of his/her life. It was indeed a torment. Luckily on Mondays were day of closing, and up to the four of Tuesday the cafe would not have reopened; only this thought had given him a least relief. 
While Dafne abandoned his/her old residence, Moris was extended in the couch of his/her house, exhausted. The look was lost in the void and its right hand it stirred, while distractedly it was toying with a ring what would have liked to give the day to Dafne before. Moris had not cried after that revelation shock of Samuel. You/he/she had never been the type from desperate weepings, for any type of reason. You/he/she had always held back them, thinking that they were loser gestures. Despite this you/he/she was strongly tried, in the mind and in the physicist. You/he/she had vomited twice, as if the body tried to free himself/herself/themselves somehow from that feeling of disgust and pain. Its state of trance was interrupted by the sound of the bell. Dafne waited in the external landing, between terror and embarrassment. Moris already knew who was behind the door and so, with a simple" arrival immediately", taken time. Raced in bath and it was washed the face. It, looking himself/herself/itself at the mirror. It hardly opened the door it smiled and it welcomed Dafne with a strong embrace, as if nothing pits. You/he/she had decided to bring forth a sad intention, in which you/he/she would have pretended not to know anything, exactly behaving himself/herself/itself as would have done in normal circumstances. Dafne embraced him/it, a worm feeling himself/herself/itself for what would have had to confess him; but the enterprise was also more difficulty of the normal one, because Moris the spiazzò subsequently, kissing her/it with heat. Taken to the unprovided one it seemed to repay, but after a pair of seconds it stopped him/it. 
«Moris, doesn't see us from some, and I believe that we should speak» it timidly said making himself/herself/itself road in the saloon. 
He accompanied him toward the couch, grabbing her a hand. 
«Your mother as it is?» churches her without succeeding in looking at him/it in face. 
«Well, the worse you/he/she is passed. However I would like immediately to speak of as we are left last week there. I/you/they have been an idiot and I/you/they have been from dogs away from you. I become me account that I have treated badly you without you had done nothing. In short, for a scribble of the cabbage I have doubted our relationship and this is from immature person. To be in Mantua helps me to understand how much, for the first time in my life, hears the necessity to give a turn to my life» he/she explained everything of a breath to avoid interruptions. 
Dafne was amazed. Nothing didn't respond and he/she hardly succeeded in mentioning a smile. You waited for to find him/it angry, both for the quarrel of the preceding week, and for his/her disappearance of the day before. You waited that Moris would have made back march on their relationship, making her all simplest. The man was settling her instead his/her love and his/her wish to close that accident, complicating incredibly the situation. In to see her/it again, the instinct to attack was supplanted her/it by that not to want to lose her/it. It tried to do the impossible one, so that she didn't say anything on his/her reflections and on the meeting with Bob, terrorized to the idea that that done had twisted the things. 
«This is for you small my» it told her handing her an elegant opened wrap, that contained the solitary one. 
Dafne turned pale; the eyes were quickly filled with tears, that were not certain of happiness, and Moris understood soon it. 
«I know that you/he/she can seem soon for an official engagement, even it will seem you a madness, but as soon as I have seen him, to Mantua, I have decided that owed to be your. I want to give you the life that deserves» it said Moris extracting the ring. 
You were unarmed. He/she didn't succeed to proferir word. But as soon as he stuck out him to put her ring, Dafne he/she didn't succeed to keep silent anymore. 
«Moris, waits, I pray you» it said a tear drying himself/herself/itself. 
«Because to wait?» it continued him, absolutely aware that was putting her/it in strong difficulty. 
Dafne suddenly felt him to uneasiness in that place. You/they had been enough few times with Bob, to feel himself/herself/themselves an extraneous to few centimeters from Moris. It had to go out of it, also aware that would have massacred him. 
«I beg you Moris, you don't understand. Me. The ams not ready to thing of the kind, and you know him/it. Had we spoken to live this thing day for day. we don't practically speak there to week and you you present with to ring?» 
«Is only a ring! Together Dafne, you and I are strong, we can go to the great one. I/you/they have been your street of exit.» 
Dafne again interrupted him/it: 
«Moris he has returned. Bob has returned.» 
After these words the expression of Moris darkened, without however to show amazement. It didn't say anything, he/she remained sat. You continued. It feared that waiting would not have him more sort. 
«You/he/she has not returned making the crazy person or threatening me. You/he/she has returned in my head, in my heart, and I believe that you/he/she had not gone away never. The know him/it that it is absurd, and The didn'ts wait me for him. He would not even have approached me. You/he/she has been everything one case and. there macaws then things that The didn'ts know and that.» 
Moris got up from the couch of release, as if you/he/she had caught fire. 
«Enough! Do you realize the cazzates that you say? Be absurd. absurd! Has you/he/she crushed you for months, has you/he/she told you atrocious lies and do I now have to feel that you have him it sticks in the heart? And as would you/he/she have convinced you? How cazzo you have been able to turn him word?» 
«Moris I pray you.» it tried to speak her. 
«Silent! Do you know what there is again? What doesn't rub a cazzo of it! I have felt enough. Be the bleakest thing that has ever seen! And now leave, leave!» 
Moris cast away the ring and the wrapping, without looking at her/it more in face. 
«Moris I pray you listen to me, you have to know about the things.» it begged her. 
«Vattene Dafne, not to force to chase out you to me to kicks. you could also like which, it is not true?» Moris uttered with bad tone while it was going him to the entry to open her door. 
Dafne ran away. 
Some hour later it passed to the cafe. Taken all of his/her things and he/she greeted the boys. Before leaving that place he turned, and with a long nostalgic look he/she greeted that that had been indeed his/her second house, in the conviction that would not probably have him more magazine. 
Definite to spend the rest of the afternoon to house with his/her mother, to which it told to have seen Bob again and to have spent the night from him. His/her mother didn't know anything of what you/he/she had brought them to separate himself/herself/themselves. You/he/she had lived from near the suffering of his/her/their daughter, and it hoped in cuor his that the things could settle. The history with a greater man to the beginning had not convinced her, yet that" Mr. Chellini" you/he/she had ended with to like her. A mature man and with the very clear personal and professional ideas. It was the firm point that served to his/her daughter, eternally with the head among the clouds. 
The separation from Roberto had in fact brought his/her daughter to do very little work here and there without future certain, and this had upset a lot both her and her husband. The woman looked for for the first time in absolute to build a true dialogue that could approach her/it to the world of his/her/their daughter, and to succeed had also put aside us very of his/her pride. It didn't mention to certain and lasting bonds anymore as the marriage, despite you/he/she had never accepted the cohabitation. Also the occasional night with his ex it didn't belong to what that woman you/he/she could bear, however you/he/she was listening I discharge him/it some daughter in silence, to understand better thing was happening. Dafne kept on being vague on the difficult things to forgive to Bob, but of certain the confusion of that moment was more evident. After a long account of Dafne, his/her mother made an intervention that went over the thousand opinions that the girl could wait him from that woman. 
«You feel Daffy, it is some that I wanted to speak, and best moment doesn't perhaps exist. Your aunt Gilds you/he/she is referred long live. Later almost twenty years has heard the necessity to call his/her sister! I believe that the resounding gesture is due to draw near some old age.» to small giggle broke to certain emotion of the woman. 
«It is a few weeks that we have started over feeling us. Is it always my sister also, no? Pardon is perhaps the more difficulty of the teachings of God.» 
His/her mother him Dafne him taken a break, with the excuse to remove the boiler from the stoves. Its eyes were painted of emotion, that before that Dafne had never seen then. His/her mother had taken back the relationships with a part of his/her family, thing on which nobody would have betted only a cent. The woman pretended to turn himself/herself/themselves to take something. In reality you/he/she was taking other time to hide the signs of his/her emotion. Then it continued. 
«Be', the point is not this. It gilds alive to Paris. Alive there alone from when her husband is dead. It looks like you/he/she has not had children, and it has only some acquired nephew. It would be nice that I took yourself a break to go to know her/it. Does it care to see for now us all but your father and I again we cannot move, and is she picked up by an association, has not society, understood at all. in short, that say of it? Paris is not the city of the artists? You/he/she has told me that you/he/she is prepared to also entertain you the whole summer, if you want. So much you don't have certain a fixed place to be lost, here in Milan.» 
Those words were an unexpected revelation. Dafne had realized of hit that had a relative to Paris, thing that you/he/she had perhaps felt to say from child but that it had entirely removed. And you/he/she was now offered her to fly in the fantastic villas lumière. The the possibility introduced him to live one period in the city that had served as crib to an inestimable art. All the problems, the dissatisfactions and the evil that had surrounded her, suddenly seemed past in according to place. 
«Is. is the most beautiful thing that mother could happen, would have had to immediately tell me him! I would be happy to go to know aunt it Gilds. Was it that that the tourist guide did, true? In short, I could detach from everything for some! It would be perfect. Let's call immediately her, I want to speak to us!» enthusiastic Dafne exclaimed. 
It jumped to the neck of his/her/their mother, happy that the same finally offering support. To depart was that that more it served at that time her. Even if in the turn of few instants, while his/her mother looked for the index book of the telephone, a thought flew toward Bob. Then he/she thought about Moris, torn to pieces by the senses of guilt. That for Bob was instead a feeling that the he/she insinuated him in belly. It considered to that long kiss, to how much it felt him/it until inside the bowel. You/he/she would immediately have reached him/it. Bob was making a run to be well, and Dafne would never have liked to allow that in expectancy another woman, one as Cassandra, could draw even the benefits of it. He/she didn't succeed in imagining him without him, neither he/she distantly succeeded in conceiving him/it with another. But it now opened the perspective in Paris. You/he/she would have been able to disconnect the plug for some, to take him a deserved instant of truce. It was the most proper solution not to make himself/herself/themselves again drag from the events and from the passion. This time he/she wanted to ponder well, before starting again himself/herself/themselves in game; and idea to do him/it distant from everything and all was attractive, a true manna from the sky. Then it considered us, and you/he/she was terrorized by the fact that Bob would have been able not to wait for her/it. The whole night would be lost, among that conflicting doubts. It was time to choose thinking indeed about herself. Definite so that you/he/she would be striven not to feel him/it for a few days. You/he/she would have programmed his/her trip and, to done things, you/he/she would have gone to him. It was the only way not to change mind and to gather that occasion to the flight. 
The following Friday, Dafne he woke up prey to a nightmare. Bob had told her to have forgiven Vanessa. 

"Daf, is for this that I have not assiduously looked for never you after you have left me. You perhaps waited yourself that I pursued yourself as I had done with Vanessa, because my way irruento to love did you you to feel long live, and you cannot deny him/it. And I also know that you have remained badly there the other evening, considering that I have started sleeping on the couch ignoring you. And I have not insisted for making the love with you. this has made you go crazy, admit him/it. in reality, hook Vanessa, has loved always her. You/he/she had come only from you for it stuffed to leave. I now know him/it, and have chosen her. The hopes that to Paris you macaws happy. good summer and good life!" 

Dafne woke up suddenly, with those words that resounded powerful in the head. Bob, in dream, you/he/she had beaten her in face all of his/her fears and his/her most intimate feelings. The evening decided that it was the moment to go to find him/it. He there was not. Dafne entered with his old keys. It made a fast turn, noticing things that the other time had not observed. Bob had left their photos in many angles of the house; you/he/she had removed every portrait. It opened the closet and it found some garments of his in an angle, perfectly folded up and perfumed. He had taken care of them as heirlooms saved by a shipwreck. There were also of the dvds and some object. Returned in the saloon it realized that there was no more trace of alcohol. Abandoned on the couch, flowed Dafne some books: from the titles they were certainly manuals of psychiatry, that mentioned to bipolar troubles and of depression. Dafne realized that the problems of Bob were more serious than that that had realized. At that time it tried a deep hate for the Chellinis, above all for Sofia. His/her state of anxiety, on as to communicate him his/her imminent departure, it did even more him insistent. Toward the nine Dafnes he/she heard the auto of Bob that parked near the residence. Found the opened door his heart taken to beat fast. Any worry crossed its mind, Dafne was there. It appeared in the saloon and he/she saw her/it, more beautiful than the imagination you/he/she could return him her. Dafne wore a light suit, that the thin and sensual physicist bandaged her. Those forms and that suit of colored veils were the most beautiful idyll that he had ever scrutinized. Long hair fell on her shoulders, loose and I moved from so that to read. He looked her/it at estasiato. The green eyes of Dafne repaid that intense look shining in penetrating way. Also him that evening had the loose hair. The long head of hair striped of silver wound a relaxed face, even though surprised. Dafne had the nth confirmation to never have placed the look on such a beautiful expression. The white light of the lamp-posts, that entered from the great window of the saloon, illuminated only that scene. Only their breath interrupted the silence. It seemed that two nobody had intention to say nothing. They observed for a long time, before Dafne brought him toward the stereo. Everything was as you/he/she had left him. Taken their preferred cd, that of sonorous columns of Hans Zimmer, for then to go I meet him, definite. He was spiazzato from that release, and more it was still it from the fact to be wound by that slender form that had believed for a long time unapproachable. Dafne conducted him/it with the shoulders to the wall, pushing him/it from the abdomen. In point of feet it arrived to him to the height of the mouth, crossing the features of it with the fingers. With the lips it grazed him a cheek, feeling the pleasant perfume of his/her hair and the skin. Him closed the eyes in nanny of that exciting and unexpected gestures. Then it reopened them to look at her/it. It was about to tell her something, panting. But her the mouth softly covered him. Some second immovable properties remained, before she began to unthread him the shirt. It looked at him/it with a hypnotic look. You bent for perfectly kissing him/it on the graven abdomen, as he/she remembered him/it. It went up again keeping on grazing him/it with the lips, crossing his/her right side. It kept on kissing him/it coming toward the neck and the ear. He to that point could feel to breathe her/it with sweet intensity. Dafne began to pick him the lobe of the ear, while with the hands it held back him the braccias against the wall, as to want to conduct alone that game appagante. Dafne hardly returned to kiss his breast, again ignoring the lips, he felt his/her fresh hands grab him the belt of the pantalonis. Later some second was untying her/it to him. To that point Bob didn't succeed in inhibiting he anchors him to touch her/it. But she escaped from his hands, falling in knee in front of him; it dragged down with itself his/her garments, making to go crazy him/it. The naked body of Bob was against to the wall. The head was turned upward, the closed eyes were sometimes squeezed by the excitement, then to lines they were shelled, lost in the void. They returned the enormous pleasure that only that young woman was able to produce, so much intensely. He/she didn't succeed in holding back some strong moans, I made exciting by the deep stamp of his/her voice. On one side you/he/she would still have been firm to the wall for times, but after a few minutes it fell her I set. Their impetus, as in thousand other occasions, way of moving didn't leave him to him in room. Bob succeeded only in detaching himself/herself/themselves from her of few centimeters, to grab the covers on the couch. Taken to kiss her/it with extreme desire, excited as not never. Dafne was again among his/her braccias. This time he was free, naked not only from the garments, but from all the pretenses. Naked on his/her Dafne. They were thousand the gestures that it tried to bring before, in agitated way. With a hand it twisted her long hair, winding her back part of the neck. With the other one it tried to free her/it from the suit, with pleasant fashion. Anxious the breast kissed her through the delicate cloth. The face grabbed her, keeping on kissing her/it, for then to bring her/it itself, with those hands that Dafne adored, winding, from the long fingers. They were the hands of an artist, as you/he/she had always thought her her, able to mould every thing. The look of Bob remained for a long time on the face of Dafne stripping her/it without looking at the rest. In that moments of ecstasy it held a constant visual contact with his/her woman, as to transmit her every single feeling. Then it had the natural instinct to touch more intimately her, but it was frightened that she changed mind, or he/she remembered ugly moments. Distracted by these thoughts it hesitated, and she hastened. With an only look of agreement, Bob understood that you/they could finally grant him the one to the other, completely. He/she kissed her along the legs, and it did again her his/her, bringing her inside the sense of the true love. Not the sterile excitement, not the wickedness, not the desire of protection but the true love, that that had tried together only in the life. Any mistake, any fear, could injure that perception of absolute fullness. 
You had seized with all of his/her strengths to the body of Bob, when he reached the maximum enjoyment inside of her. They howled in unison, pleasantly torn to pieces by that last unbelievable mezz'ora. He remained her above, and its head abandoned him worn-out on her breast. Long perfumed hair was shed on the breast of Dafne, that uninterruptedly caressed them. The breaths were for a long time strenuous. He would never be gone out of the body of his/her great love. Accompanied by the notes of the CD that anchors it played, they were lost between new kisses and other effusions. 
The trill of the cellular phone of Bob interrupted everything. 
«I won't answer to anybody» it declaimed him with a half smile. 
«Who can be? It is late.» churches her anxious. Or only he/she snoops perhaps. 
«I answer, calm» it said him, having read her in the thought. 
You covered with the cover and it went to answer. Dafne understood that it was a woman, almost certainly Cassandra. Then that first thought of his was denied by his last sentence" Ok Giò there will be! Thanks thousand, are a friend!" 
«It was Giovanna creative manager of the agency in Turin with which collaborated last year. It seems that there am way of putting again me in game with a national country. And I believe both now to take back.» 
In to say these words you/he/she had immediately taken back his/her place next to Dafne, winding her/it in an energetic embrace. Taken to kiss her/it, happy that that evening seemed the beginning of a new life. Dafne understood that the enthusiasm was too much to the stars, and he/she thought that if you/they had started over making the love you/he/she would not have succeeded in telling him of Paris anymore or, you/he/she would not have succeeded anymore worse in departing. 
«Bob, has been stupendous, you/he/she is everything stupendous, also for your job.» 
He stopped her/it with a passionate kiss, of those that didn't leave way to be interrupted. They hardly detached her taken back his/her discourse to him. 
«Bob, would like now to speak to you, I would like to speak of us, of thing to do. and above all of to thing that concerns me and that you have to know.» you/he/she began with worry. 
«What Daf? What do I have to know? Because to me it seems all clear. Or does it still enter it with Moris?» 
«Moris is a closed chapter, perhaps never initiated indeed. And it also seems all clear for me. Rather it is him/it of, sure. Kind later tonight. Despite this, I have decided to spend the summer in Paris, from a sister of my mother.» it said her lowering him/it look fifty-fifty sentence. 
Bob felt a fist to the stomach, you/he/she felt the breath miss him for a long instant. Then he/she hardly succeeded to bofonchiare some word, as to realize better what had felt. 
«A. Paris. the summer?» 
«Bob is a thing that I have been deciding for a few days, you/he/she is an occasion that I didn't expect me» she responded while he got further incredulous. 
«An occasion? We have just made the love, I believed that he/she wanted to say that we were about to reconstruct our history.» 
«And it is so Bob, but I want to find again my serenity before doing him/it. I don't want to do him/it on the enthusiasm of a moment, not this time. My life is twisted more times in the turn of few months, it serves me time» it replied her trying to approach him/it. 
«It doesn't have sense Daf, bushels speaking in the whole summer distant. And when you would have intention to depart?» 
«Birth Monday morning.» it whispered Dafne with the voice that was strangled her in throat. 
«Cazzo Daf, is in two days! You have already decided everything! And have made the love with me before telling me him! This is not correct, don't I deserve a thing of the kind. and in the meantime thing The should I give according to you?» it told him altered and confused. 
«Could focus on your career and on your sessions Bob! Do we have to recover ourselves as people, before as couple, doesn't understand him/it? Have been separate for months, have hated you with all of my strengths, have been with another to try to cancel you! I need to take back breath before throwing again me in this history.» 
«To take back I say a word. however to throw again you among my braccias is not weighed you! Because you have made the love with me? Because, if you still needed time?» it pronounced Bob, while it was putting again together his/her suits in agitated way. 
«No Bob, cannot afford anymore than to speak to me this way! Have you forgotten what I have borne me for your love? Nessun'altra would have been prepared to listen anchors yourself, even for an instant! And despite all have listened to you and have given again you myself! But for you it is not enough, do you want everything and immediately, correct?» it shouted her furious. 
«You think that I can feel in guilt the whole life Daf? Or do you think that can be restarted, with you that you will treat me as a merda and you will blame me all to every single occasion? No, so is not correct! I believed that I wanted to forgive, to help to forget me. and you throw out instead your recriminations when you macaws with the shoulders to the wall.» it clarified him with extreme suffering. 
«They are not at all with the shoulders to the wall, simply I don't want to expedite the times to your liking! I don't feel me in guilt to have made the love with you, you/he/she was not programmed.» 
«You don't want to expedite the times» it replied Bob with light sarcasm «we have been a couple for years, do we know each other as our pockets, am I trying to overcome my past to live a normal history with the woman that I love, and don't you want to expedite the times? Was it perhaps with Moris that you didn't have to expedite them, doesn't it seem you?» 
«Perfect Bob! And then you talk to me of recriminations. Compliments!» it howled her, lifting himself/herself/itself standing and the suit nervously inserting himself/herself/itself. 
«Forgive me Daf, I am trying only to understand the coherence of that that you say and that you do. Because indeed I don't succeed in following you! Because you have not immediately told me that you were here for greeting me? Answer me! Because you have made the love with me?» 
«Have told you that was not programmed! I wanted to see you! I wanted immediately to tell you everything! Then I have seen you and I have not understood anything, because despite all I love you!» 
«You will go to Paris to put again in sixth your life, and you will leave here me to put to place mine, in the most delicate moment of all of our history. This is not what I consider love Daf.» it said him with steadiness and disappointment. 
«Bob is only a few months!» 
«Is here the difference among what try what evidently try you! For me a hour without you, in this moment, it is already intolerable.» 
«I am not saying that for me it will be easy. But cannot afford to insinuate that mine is not love! This indeed you cannot do him/it!» the eyes of Dafne were filled with tears. 
«Then hands me with you.» Bob answered provocative with tone, that Dafne perfectly gained. 
«And if I told yourself no?» in the same moment in which it asked the question, Dafne was afraid in to feel the answer. 
«No Dafs, would not do you nothing of badly, if it is what you were insinuating. I won't allow anymore simply anybody to humiliate me. All the suffered humiliations have brought me to become the dog with which you were before. You are right you know, I owe first to find again my dignity and to create my autostima, and I won't do him/it more with the violence. But I won't do him/it of certain becoming a little dog that always lowers the head. From you I want only something of clean, and you have now played dirty.» 
Dafne remained of plaster to feel those words. You/he/she was fought. The whole grudge of her entered conflict with his needs. In that instant they took awareness that to restart to those conditions, would have been a massacre for both. You with a knot in throat damped that painful silence. 
«So it doesn't work. The love cannot be enough Bob. And it is for this that I need to be distant for some. I would like to be nearby you. Alone God knows how much I would like him/it. But I have too anger to bury, before doing him/it. And I know that expediting the times we would ruin everything. It would be a life of recriminations, we would end up hating indeed us. We would end with to massacre us. The love doesn't withstand for ever, even between me and you. And I don't want to also ruin the only possibility to be together in normal knot.» 
«Yes, so it doesn't go. I know him/it» he responded, looking at her/it with a look that the soul penetrated her. 
It gave her a brief and intense kiss at the same time. It brought her inside the whole sadness of that that had the air of a regard. Dafne would never be stopped, you/he/she would have referred the love. Instead Bob turned her back and brought him in room. Before closing behind the door of itself, it bewared her/it with such an intensity of to remove the breath: desperation and love melted together. That last look gave her the certainty that nothing would have allowed Bob to forget her/it. Only the memory of that look would have given her the strength to stay to Paris. From that separation it was waited for to scar the wounds. It is alone at that time you/he/she would have been correct to return together. Yet that door that he/she was closed made her a terrible evil. He/she left Bob with the heart in pieces. He had submitted her his/her most intimate revelations and his lived of humiliation, and she was leaving him/it, even though for few months. 
It was not certain so that Dafne would have liked to greet him/it. 



Speaking of Paris 
The following Monday Dafne looked in Milan make more and more himself/herself/themselves small, from the porthole of his/her airplane. The breast hurt her, an acute evil: Bob was not never her missed as at that time. In that precise instant, he bewared the sky of the window of his/her room, crying as a child. It was June 19 th 2006. 
Dafne was amazed from aunt it Gilds. It was a minute woman of over fifty years, apparently fragile in the aspect but with a particular verve. He/she lived in an elegant trilocale in the heart of Montparnasse. It had been being widow for ten years and you/he/she had not had children. The lost possession the great love of its life, had dried up her. Then you/he/she had tried to give a turn to his/her existence, imposing himself/herself/itself to react. This way in 2003 you/he/she had founded a small female association, of which it was chairwoman, that dealt him with art, in all the forms of possible expression. Aunt and nephew immediately entered good tuning. The girl had never had the opportunity of knowing relatives from mother and those from father they were by now a distant memory. That woman seemed all of this that his/her sister or his/her mother, were not, and you/he/she would never have been. The fancy and the art from a part and a castrante, cold rationality from the other. Dafne labored indeed to believe that that woman was his/her relative, and you/he/she was embittered for not having her/it known before. 
Dafne spoke from immediately to it Gilds some relationship extremely conflittuale with his/her/their mother. With highest amazement, his/her aunt helped him to understand that the cold character of the greatest sister was due to big problem list lived by girl, that was always estate for itself for pride or humiliation. The grandparent of Dafne had been impossible parents. His/her father had istaurato a real regime of terror. It gilds you/he/she had had the strength to rebel running to France to alone twenty-two years. His/her sister had not forgiven him/it to him. Contrarily you/he/she had preferred to suffer that situation up to trentatré years, when he/she married the father of Dafne under consent of the demanding head of the family. The stories of his/her/their aunt were illuminating indeed. Dafne him made account than few knew his/her mother. 
Once in France, it Gilds you/he/she was gotten married; her husband and she didn't have a lira. They understood that the destiny would have been generous only if you/they had had the strength and the determination to build him/it to him. This way they succeeded in creating him from zero a discreet position; the apartment in which Dafne was found was the tangible demonstration of it. 
Having worked for years as it drives, it Gilds it knew whatever detail of that city. Paris was the most extraordinary place that Dafne had ever seen. During the years of the high school you/he/she had visited Rome, Praga and Barcellona, that of certain you/they had fascinated her. But Paris was the city of the artists for excellence. In the turn of little time, after the first customary visits with his/her/their aunt, Dafne purchased good ability to stir in independent way. It had good memoirs of French, and it took advantage to improve him/it of it. 
An evening, they walked along the Seine. The summer breeze gave truce to that that had been a very sultry day. While Dafne observed that idyllic panorama, his/her aunt asked her a sudden question, how much unexpected. 
«Beauty, would go then now you to tell me thing it upsets yourself so much?» 
Dafne remained spiazzata from that question. Taken time pretending not to have understood. 
«In that sense aunt?» 
«In the sense of the heart I imagine.» he/she answered it Gilds, with the whole endless wisdom of the houses. 
Dafne lowered the look suffering, but pleased that you/he/she could finally speak of what it tormented her/it. His/her aunt inspired her a lot of trust, and you/he/she had a great spirit of observation. 
«Be' dear, it has been being for three weeks that you fumble with that your jail cell, that however has not rung never. Do I deduce then that you coop waiting with anxiety that someone does him/it play, no?» 
Smiled Dafne; it was very stricken from the attention that his/her aunt, hardly known, you/he/she was already reserving her. That evening was long. Dafne told for thread and for sign his/her history, from the phase of the falling in love to the most painful details of the relationship with Bob. It gilds you/he/she had realized that his/her niece was not to the takings with any crush, but that story went well over its imagination. Word had not uttered for the whole time. Only some sign of caress, when the eyes of Dafne were made shiny. At the end of the long story, the girl concluded with a question, that the expression of a defenseless baby painted her. 
«Tell me aunt, have I done to come here well, true?» 
Gild he/she embraced him drying her tears. 
«Dafne, nobody can give you this answer. Unless you have done out of spite him, I can tell only you that to mine discreet opinion has been the correct choice. Rather you have been a holy to remain after all these intrigues and these endless revelations there. The would be run away very before. Nobody has dragged you on that flight and nobody ties here yourself. But now that there six, you could remain us up to that your heart won't be ready.» 
«But my heart is him/it aunt! I love him/it, I ever love not it as. On this I don't have doubts. He is still my only love. And I know what time you/he/she has told me the whole truth. It is alone that I don't succeed in forgetting to overcome the past. I am afraid that starts over hurting me, that with the time everything can return as before. But then I think about his/her look, that look of the last evening when you/he/she has greeted me. Fire is branded to in my mind. and it misses me as the air, aunt» it complained about Dafne. 
«I know you from little Dafne; but as it is often said, blood is not water. For this I should try disgust for Roberto, or as you call him/it you, Bob. But from what you have transmitted me, I understand that he is the first one to hate himself. And it now has to learn to love him. And your grudge would not have helped him/it.» 
«But my love perhaps yes.» Dafne responded with doubt. 
«You/he/she can be true also this, but he/she thinks about the fact that you won't be forever away. Take yourself your time, if you believe that can help to take back in hand your life. He will understand. If it loves yourself it will try everything to change indeed, and it will wait, even if it deals with months. You after all aspects from years. But only you can decide qual it is the most correct thing.» 
It gilds it seemed to have the most reassuring answers of the world. Despite the whole confusion, that trip had been a gust of fresh air for both. 



Speaking of future 
Bob, after the first terrible days of agony, you/he/she had decided that would be thrown headfirst on the job. It was the only thing that would have held him/it floating. Definite to return in the school where it taught. Besides it began to participate in the advertising country that you/they had proposed him to Turin. 
But once I taken the first working appointments, to follow them with attention was difficult indeed; the crises of panic didn't give him truce. In the turn of two weeks you/he/she was reduced to depend from ansiolitici and from every sort of medicine that could assuage that anguish. Because of these remedies him made account that its creative ability was not the same one anymore. It considered to the references that Dafne had given him speaking of the strategic psychotherapy, during one of his/her crises. He/she read something on the matter and after a brief search on internet it fixed an appointment. The progress with the psychiatrist had evidently stranded. It needed another support, above all now that had found again and lost Dafne, practically in the turn of an only week. That meeting was decisive. Thanks to that way of approaching to his/her problem, Bob discovered that that situation was surmountable. The crises of panic, the tied up episodes to the violence and the fear of the abandonment, were not sign of an incurable pathology that would have made him enslaved the whole life. Tantomeno would have had to soothe forever them with the medicines. You/he/she would have known and faced his/her limits without managing in the past. With that run you/he/she would have intervened on his/her present to recover from the that scripts put to face the depth pain that marked him/it into effect. Finally to Bob it seemed possible, it felt that thanks to the objective of those sessions you/he/she would be put again standing. He/she saw indeed a street of exit. 
But every evening, returning home, during a swim in swimming pool or listening to a song to the radio, the head it flew to Paris. You would not have been with him during that run. Dafne missed her as the oxygen. Despite this it was angry, he/she didn't succeed in sending down that escape. It accepted the motivations of it and rationally he/she understood her, but it didn't understand as a love and a passion you/they could be found again so strong, and the day later to succeed in getting further him of it. 
Fifty-fifty July something happened that would have distracted him/it from that thoughts, at least initially. It received a call of a friend, that reported him that Cassandra had had an ugly accident in auto. Bob raced in the hospital. The auto of Cassandra had been crushed by a tir while it was reentering out of town from a job. It was not in danger of life, but sees the description of the accident, it was safe for miracle. Bob succeeded in seeing her/it to distance of a couple of days from what happened. Entered his/her room, that image tore to pieces him/it enormously; Cassandra had numerous wounds in face and on the neck. It was firm in a rigid collar, the rest of the body seemed unharmed, except an ankle. He/she hardly saw him/it, the blue eyes of the woman were made shiny. To work he/she succeeded in hiding his/her embarrassment in the being it approves in that state from the man that it had been liking her for years. 
«I don't have to be a beautiful show, true? I am happy to see you.» 
«I believe that struccata you are very beautiful indeed instead. The have always seen you impeccable and I give you now seem to ragazzina instead, do I give you know him/it?» he/she answered her him, trying with success to damp the tension. In the meantime you/he/she had taken her hand. 
Cassandra had seen the death in face, and those wounds disguised an expression that Bob had never seen her. You/he/she had always lived her in working circle, sporadically to some supper. It was the surest woman of itself that had ever known. It was a cynic beast, in the jungle of advertising and admirers that it surrounded her/it. In that bed, it was fragile and defenseless. 
«You say that the signs will stay?» churches her timorous. 
«But what doing go think? Everything will return to place, on the face they are only ugly scratches» Bob reassured her/it. 
«It will be. but The have the neck and to part of the forehead bandaged; The don'ts believe that I/you/he/she am halo for ugly scratches. These guys don't tell me nothing» it sentenced, turning the face from the opposite part. 
He grazed her cheek, trying to make to turn her/it. 
«Cassandra you could die the other afternoon, and you have only an a collarino, some bandage and a bandaged foot. I would think about this. I succeed in seeing almost in full your face, and signs won't remain, believe me.» 
The face tired of Cassandra was marked by a pair of tears, that it dried in all hurry. 
The following week would have been low after all the checks of the case. Bob had already returned to find a couple of times her. The day before his/her exit he was there, and the woman was particularly nervous. 
«I don't want mine to come to be from me; I have known only the peace after having put three hundred kilometers of distance between me and them. they would be me The sets, it would be to nightmare!» about he complained her, while Bob helped him to put around away some of the shed magazines for the room. 
«Be' Cassandra, their daughter has had an ugly accident and you/he/she has a tied-up foot; in more she lives alone and you/he/she has to medicate himself/herself/themselves the wounds to the head and on the neck. Do you believe them so crazy in to want to be a few days from you?» churches him with sarcasm. 
«No Robi, knows him/it, and I adores them. But do I already know that me tartasseranno. The pray you, Khan The invent that we go out together and that The wills be from you? I pray you!» churches her with impudence. 
«I have met them and done know the day after your accident; it seems you that after five days can tell him that we are together?» it replied him, had a good time by that impudent application. 
«From the Roberto, we tell him that you are not felt her/it to you to talk him of it in the hospital to me in that state. Or let's tell only him that are great friends. Is this more believable no?» 
«I have understood Cassandra, could we also say him/it, but then thing you will do alone in the house? Is there someone that could lend you a hand to their place?» it investigated Bob. 
«I will get by me. I don't want anybody for house. And however I don't believe that I would have great choice. thousand idiots with which to make worldly life but any true friend. It will seem you strange, but you are the only one that has returned in the hospital three times.» 
Bob stared at her/it; you/he/she felt him very stricken from those words. Cassandra was exposed quite a lot. It was a very tied up woman to the appearances, yet at that time it seemed to show him his/her limits. Bob as woman had never appreciated her. Even if in past there had been no Dafne, you/he/she would never have tied with such a cynical person and social climber. But that face, for the first time without mask, it finally seemed him human. 
«Be', we begin to tell yours that you will be from me, then we discuss of it.» 
Smiled Cassandra. You/he/she had not often seen never Roberto Chellini out of the as job as in that period. His/her physical conditions it was not happy to, but that accident was perhaps creating this to which she had been inhaling for years: a small opening with that so fascinating man, and so suddenly thoughtful. 
Her with the parents of Cassandra it worked. They did the idea that that Roberto was the new secret lover of his/her/their daughter, therefore they didn't hesitate to leave her/it with him and to leave again. 
Once climbed in car, Bob turned to Cassandra with some embarrassment. 
«You feel, that say about being seriously from me a few days, up to that you will be better? I have started over working, you will have available house and time in perfect relax, but at least you won't be completely alone. There is a small stanzetta that we don't have. be', that have not used never.» 
Cassandra gathered the expression of Bob in to consider, without shade of doubt, to Dafne. Despite this his application did her/it go crazy of joy. That invitation was clear sign that with Dafne you/he/she was definitely ended. It didn't even serve to ask him him. And that invitation perhaps meant a new interest of Roberto in its comparisons. 
In reality he wanted only to be kind. He/she knew what he/she meant to feel himself/herself/themselves alone, and he/she didn't succeed in pretending not to have heard the words of Cassandra on the fact that the presumed friends had also left her alone in the hospital. What he/she didn't know, is that that woman was well determined to take advantage the more possible of that sudden situation, to get what also wanted. 
Cassandra entered house with the help of Bob. It found that residence very pleasant, even though modern. It scrutinized around for looking for possible traces of the presence of Dafne; it was happy more and more in to ascertain that there was not a lot of that it brought back to a female presence. Bob had removed every photo; that saloon was already enough soaked with memoirs, more than how much he succeeded in bearing of it. 
Cassandra was radiant, for how much it tried not to give too much it to see; you/he/she would never have thought that his dreadful accident could give her such an emotion. The colleagues were a lot of in adoration for that man, she had certainly been the number one in as for patience. It looked at him/it absorbed while he helped him to systematize some of his/her suits in a free chest. Bob wore a clear suit of flax, with a black sweater under to the jacket. The pantalonis were to low life marking the slender life of it. Cassandra saw every day clients and colleagues in suit, yet nobody brought them with more elegance and intrigue of Roberto. To his to stoop himself/herself/themselves toward the drawer, locks of long hair they escaped him from the elastic one or from behind the ears, ending on the face. This gave a greater intensity to his/her expression. In that brief instants Cassandra fixed his/her eyes; it was often difficult to establish exactly its color. They were simply magnetic. 



Speaking of to love surprises 
It was ferragosto. After some days of ugly time, Dafne and it Gilds they decided to finally make a trip very attended, to the famous Palace of Versaille. Dafne was excited as a child to the idea to see her/it. 
It was in Paris from two months and the thought to never have felt Bob it tormented her/it. You/he/she would have liked a solo sign, and it would have very wanted to give him/it. It is sure what July and August it was departed without two nobody succeeded in doing him/it. Dafne was not allowed to demolish; you were for becoming distracted himself/herself/themselves there, to understand whether to get ready himself/herself/themselves to the future, and it convinced him in continuation that not to feel the best thing was him/it. 
Together with his/her/their aunt, you/he/she had visited big part of the artistic attractions in Paris; it still missed so much to see, above all for a thirsty person of art as Dafne. 
But tourist activities were not left to him same. It gilds you/he/she had inserted his/her niece inside some activities of the association; this helped him to improve his/her French, that to the arrival few flowing was shown in the conversation. You/they were dealt with to organize a cineforum in half summer, entirely devoted to the Nouvel Vague. But to Ferragosto, it Gilds and Dafnes dispersed him, granting himself/herself/itself one day of absolute liberté. Together with the two women Bastien and Alizèe were united. Bastien was one of the acquired nephews of it Gilds; the mother of the boy was sister of the dead husband, as well as only love of his/her life. Alizèe had been being his/her fiancée for a couple of years. Both were twenty-eight years old. Bastien was a tall boy of average build; its skin was pale as that of a child. Hair was very clear, as the eyes. It was from a little reentered by the Blue Coast, but of that vacation its complexion didn't preserve some sign. Alizèe introduced him instead with a beautiful complexion and more definite lines, certainly helped by the Brazilian origins from mother. It was a girl in meat, from the extremely beautiful features of the face; the great black eyes and the lips well you draw they swayed the attention from the build some heavy. The two boys were happy to know and to accompany Dafne in that that promised to be a beautiful day. 
The visit inside the Palace was amazing. Dafne had never seen anything of the kind, both in luxury and in greatness. It stirred before and back for the great Gallery of the Mirrors, with dreamy air. To the sight of that enchanting place, satisfaction was uncontrollable. For years you/he/she had seen of it and read on the texts of school, but to be himself/herself/themselves of person there was a whole other thing. Ripercorrendo was the most famous places of its preferred historical period; the house of the sovereigns of France, killed by the greatest revolution of the history. 
While it is Gilding and Bastiens remained to rest himself/herself/themselves inside the stately gardens of the Palace, Dafne and Alizèe they decided to visit the Grand Trianon. For both it was the first visit to Versaille, and they had intention to see the of it more possible. 
A sudden indisposition of Dafne was to ruin that whole frenzy, that began to accuse sharp pains to the stomach. It found way of taking a seat and it tried to reassure Alizèe. He/she explained her that it was guilt of the tiredness, tied up to the fact to hardly have touched his/her lunch to the sack. He/she asked her not to speak to it Gilds of that indisposition without momentary doubt. The evening the four stopped him in a characteristic restaurant to dine, near Mont-Martre. Dafne understood that the hunger didn't have anything to do with it granché with its discomfort. Later the day went out of buon'ora, saying to it Gilds that a jump would have done to buy some warm croissantses. Once reentered, his/her aunt there was not, but you/he/she had left a ticket, informing her/it that you/he/she was due to escape because of some urgent matters. Dafne placed the croissantses, then it extracted from the purse a pouch smaller than it hid after all to his/her closet. 
That same morning, to more than eight hundred kilometers, Bob faced the third one sat by the new psychotherapist. 
That actual way of facing his/her problems you/he/she was strengthening him/it. It felt to hold his/her potentialities to succeed in transforming the limits in resources. And these changes were surprisingly rapid. You/he/she was discovering an internal strength indeed determined. As man emerged, first still that as I give birth, companion or worker. You/he/she was managing his/her distance from Dafne in mature way. It missed her, this was undeniable. But it tried to go on, preparing himself/herself/itself to the possibility to have to do without it, perhaps forever. 
Cassandra had not gotten a lot in the days when you/they had shared the apartment. Nevertheless their relationship he was done more confidential. Bob had helped a lot her to face the discovery that, as feared, some due scars to the accident would not easily have disappeared. In expectancy an aesthetical intervention would perhaps have been able to improve the things, but for the time being you/he/she was learning to accept that signs, that showily marked her part of the sottomento and the neck. This event had subsequently touched Bob, that had been her near to sustain its outlets and its discomfort. Or after all, she perhaps, helped in turn it to feel less only himself/herself/themselves and less absorbed from the job. You/he/she had known a side of humbler Cassandra of that of façade, and this had distracted a lot of his/her evenings. You was making mutual company in a sultry, and desert Milan because of the summer exoduses. 
Cassandra, even though upset by his/her incidental post, you/he/she had tried everything create with Bob an atmosphere that went over the friendly relationship. It was convinced that friendship was a good beginning, but he/she didn't want to consolidate too much her, otherwise you/he/she would have denied the possibility to be born to qualcos'altro. You would never have been satisfied with the friendship; you/he/she had been a beautiful footstep before, but its objective was not certain. Bob, seemed instead not to see other, if not an attractive and nice woman with which to spend some time. 
On August twenty-five Cassandra would have completed trentaquattro years; Bob asked her to call some common friend for a supper to house or a pizza in center. But she seemed inflexible. 
«For charity, I don't feel like seeing any Robi. It doesn't suit me.» it said burdens bored, for fact what he proposed her something in group. 
«But Cassandra, is closed in the house from half July! You/he/she could be a good occasion to see some people again. Mistake or have you told me you same that someone has looked for you?» it replied Bob. 
«Yes, but not because dies from the desire to see me, only because to the job I am irreplaceable, everything here. And in fact I will start over working from house, before makes to fail the agency.» it said her with conceited air. 
«You are too much pessimist on the personnel and too much sure of you on the professional one. If only I made some equilibrium among the two things, would be a perfect woman to get married! Don't you want to celebrate then?» Bob winked with witty air. 
Cassandra hesitated before answering. That sure and sharp frecciata of Bob had struck her in full. Him the inclusive ones, so the it drew near and the face grazed with her fingers. 
«Do something, pizza from me, with cold beer and a beautiful film! Can you/he/she go?» the churches with sweetness. 
«Yes, you/he/she can go» she responded blushing. 
Only that man had the ability to embarrass so much her. That clear eyes and depths succeeded to spiazzarla, always and however. "As you/he/she would have been if that look was loaded of desire? Would you/he/she ever have been able to be more meddler of so?" Cassandra would have given all to discover him/it. 
A few days before the birthday, Bob wandered in center in the attempt to purchase some thought that could throw her on the moral one. Among the shops still closed for vacations and the scarce knowledge of the tastes of the woman, the search was difficult. Despite this, Bob had a serene expression. To make something nice for a woman was a lot him missed. It found a shop of class that he/she sold intimate; definite to give her a good person. While the order put him/it in a sophisticated packet, he lost him among thousand thoughts. It began to wonder if that gift could be misunderstood. Of sudden it began to wonder you display her avances of Cassandra they were or less Royal, as you/he/she had always sustained Dafne. He/she anchors with these thoughts in the head, Bob entered the bath of a cafe of the center. After the hands and legacy to have washed the hair, an instant stayed to fix its image, reflected in the mirror. To that point, the thoughts fly well more distant. 
In that same instant, also Dafne fixed his/her image, with more stunned air, in the bath of his/her aunt it Gilds. Now it was certain that soon everything would be changed, without still succeeding in shinily establishing if in well or in badly. It gilds it entered bath, noticing that Dafne had not reached her to table yet. Smiled at his/her niece, that immediately was thrown to her neck. 
«I have to return in Milan!» it said Dafne crying. 
«Sure not to want to wait for some yet? I believe is wise that you I put back a few other days.» 
Dafne nodded, recognizing that the suggestion of his/her/their aunt was wise, as every time. 

The evening of August twenty-five Cassandra went out, direct homeward of Bob. You/he/she had decided to declare himself/herself/themselves, once and for all. It hoped that its birthday reserved her the most beautiful gift. 
After a fast appetizer, Bob lifted the telephone to order two pizzas. Cassandra looked him/it at estasiata: Bob had the untied hair and a very serene face. He/she wore a pant of dark flax, wide on the legs. Above, a shirt adherent to short sleeves, that it marked the harmonious chest and the wide shoulders of it. His was not an excessive musculature. It was everything well delineated, taken care of by those that Bob defined a healthy feeding and a healthy swim in swimming pool. Without counting a generous mother nature, that aesthetically had not neglected at all him. After supper, the two arranged the film to see. Just before to insert the dvd, Bob decided to give her gift. While Cassandra discarded his/her good person, an auto was entering the district, destined to arrive soon in front of house of Bob. 
Cassandra didn't make him miss the wisecrack; after a thanks, drew near enthusiastically to Bob with particular impudence. 
«I would have preferred that chose me something you.» it whispered after having moved his long hair behind the ear. 
Bob was embarrassed. It immediately damped the situation grasping the remote control to start the film. But Cassandra grabbed the remote control and threw him/it on the other side of the couch. It drew near to few centimeters from his face and the takings among the hands. 
«You cannot pretend not to have understood.» 
It immediately drew near him to kiss him/it. He threw back the head grabbing her wrists. 
«I regret Cassandra, but it am not the case, indeed» it replied him. 
«Thing is, I am not your type?» churches she, bothered by that refusal. 
«It is not this, I don't believe in the ideal types; I believe in the love. You are a beautiful woman. But I cannot now complicate the things. I regret indeed» he/she explained Bob. 
«Creeds in the love, but do I have the clean feeling that you don't do anything to try again it. because? Because you don't want to turn page? I would give you all myself, I would like only to be able to try. we have been well in this period, you cannot deny him/it.» 
After this raw declaration he/she didn't leave him time neither to answer, neither to get up. It grabbed him/it with decision and he/she kissed him/it. He tried to wriggle out himself/herself/themselves, but that kiss overwhelmed him/it, and after a first resistance if the granted ones. That woman had pursued him/it for years with silent devotion. The desire that Cassandra communicated him was contrasted to the refusal of Dafne. At that time Bob felt him desired, as you/he/she was the only man on the earth, feeling of which you/he/she had intense need. 
In that same moment Dafne went down from his/her auto, parked next to house of Bob. The girl had the feeling that the heart beat her on one side to the other of the breast. It was about to see Bob again, and it was about to speak to him of something of which it sticks he didn't persuade, but what time it made her/it happy. In to draw near to the door of entry it flowed that the great glass door of the living room had the lifted curtain; from the inside it filtered the weak light of the lamps and the power on television. Dafne decided to give one peered at before playing. It was certain that his/her Bob would have perceived on the couch, even exhausted after his/her trainings in swimming pool, perhaps abandoned to listen to music in bathrobe, with the hair still bathed, as you/he/she was usual to do after the shower; or you/he/she would perhaps have seen him make a game to chess with himself. But you/he/she would ever have imagined to see his/her Bob that kissed Cassandra. Dafne whitened. The blood the he froze in the veins, immobilizing her/it. It withdrew the head and he/she remained leaned to the wall letting then himself/herself/itself slip for desperate earth. It turned the content of his/her purse on the lawn, in the attempt to look for the keys of the auto. The anxiety and the dark confused her/it. Before you/he/she was go decided that you/he/she would again have looked. Now the scene was different. Bob had taken the distances from the woman. It hid the face among the hands, with nervousness; then he threw back the hair in an attitude that didn't not at all seem serene. It followed a caress of Cassandra, that the hair of Bob grazed with to do very confidential. Dafne didn't succeed in looking over, and it ran away. 
Cassandra tried to take back the physical contact with Bob, but this time he was firm in his/her position. You excused for being granted him that kiss, but its intention confirmed her not to want to go over, neither sentimentally, neither tantomeno physically. After having accompanied again her/it, it reentered to house. In front of the quarter of his/her residence something upset him/it; it was a strange feeling, that he/she didn't know how to make sense of himself/herself/themselves. Desire came him to take a seat on the step of the door of entry. The summer seemed ended, and the temperatures were not very generous anymore. The sky had thousand different colors, Bob would have looked at him/it for times. It was reformed for that kiss; for a long time you/he/she was felt abandoned, but he/she now knew that, for how much rationally it desired him/it, nothing could remove Dafne from his/her heart. You/he/she would have given all not to try that void. The summer was about to end and he didn't know anything of her. Not even a call. Lost in those thousand reflections, the look ended for earth: to its left it flowed a ticket. It picked up him/it and he/she saw with amazement that was a ticket of the Air France: for the exactness a Paris-Milan of the same day. Bob had a wince. 
It was the one of the morning. You/he/she would never be been able to fall to house of Dafne to that time. It was sure that that ticket was his. You/he/she had shaken, impatient. Felice for the fact that had returned, but frightened to the idea that you/he/she had seen him/it with Cassandra. As you/he/she would have succeeded in explaining her misunderstanding? Only the morning later, meeting her/it, you/he/she would have had his/her answers. 
That night Bob fell asleep to work, helped by a sleep aid. To the nine of the morning it was already in front of house of Dafne. From an auto, on the other side of the road, the parents of the girl went down at that time. Months had been being departed for the last time that you/they were seen. You had the very disturbed air. His/her father remained in auto and went away. Dolores crossed the road, going I meet him decided. 
«Roberto! Thing us ago here?» churches very amazed and some annoyed. 
«Safe Dolores. I regret indeed to disturb her/it; it gave me of the you the last time.» it said him to break the ice. 
«You/he/she has been being passed a lot for the last time. Does thing bring yourself here?» churches her looking for in awkward way the keys of house. It was nervous. 
«I know that Dafne has returned from Paris, I imagine both from you.» 
The mother of Dafne was immobilized, more and more brim. 
«Who tells you him that you/he/she has returned?» he/she asked Dolores in the attempt to take time. 
Bob noticed the embarrassment in the face of the woman. 
«I know him/it and enough. Do I beg her, is it in the house?» churches him firm. 
«You feel Roberto, I don't want there to enter these your matters. I know only that Dafne is not here. Don't ask me other.» 
That attitude made suspicious a lot of Bob, extremely convinced that the woman was lying. 
«Feels Dolores, I know that last night Dafne has come from me. However you/he/she has not played. I believe has seen me with a friend and you/he/she has perhaps misunderstood a certain thing. We are already a lot of incasinati, and I don't want more tender dormant our situation. I have need to see her/it, I beg her/it.» churches humbly. 
«Roberto she there is not for indeed. But you are right, you/he/she has come from you last night, it had to speak to you; then you/he/she has seen you with that other and you/he/she has returned here, destroyed. And this morning you/he/she is made to accompany again in the airport. It is a testona, it had to rest here to house, and instead.» he/she confessed the mother of Dafne, even though aware of to have already spoken too much. 
«I regret Roberto, but I have already told you more than what I was able. Dafne has been very clear» it continued Dolores. 
«Thing didn't have to tell me? What has you/he/she returned in Paris?» churches him, hoping to know about the other. 
«Nothing of nothing I had to tell you! You feel Roberto, I have also tried there to tell her that you were passing only perhaps an evening with a friend. But you/he/she is convinced to have you lost and he/she now wants to settle himself/herself/themselves in France. I believe that I/you/he/she am a madness in a moment so. but it is to testona. You/he/she has made us race to the airport to the seven of the morning» he/she explained the woman, evidently in disagreement with the impulsive choice of his/her/their daughter. 
«Dolores I have need to understand, does thing mean that he/she believes to have me lost? Is it convinced that I am with that woman?» he/she asked worried Bob. 
«Roberto, knows only that last night you/he/she howled as a crazy person, and my only thought was to calm her/it. It kept on repeating to have made a stronzata to have left you for so much time, that has pushed you among the braccias of another. and that its life didn't have anymore here sense. I don't understand there nothing. I have never known thing is taken you this spring, I believed that you would have gotten married. And you have made a big disaster instead. Just now.» 
Bob was confused, you/he/she didn't understand those half sentences of Dolores, that of sure you/he/she was not saying everything. It looked for so to favor the woman hoping to get information on Dafne. 
«You are right Dolores, on everything. Dafne and I finally have to restart, I have my guilts, that I bring behind me as a boulder; and Dafne perhaps has his after this summer. However I love her/it and I want to be together with her, to start over me, to marry her/it. I have need to see her/it, and she has to help me.» 
«Roberto, if he/she sees you arrive there, that he/she kills me. The fact is that. there is to thing that The ams not able. really The ams not able! I am convinced that certain things is goes said, the attitude of my daughter is unforgivable, but I has the tied up hands, indeed.» 
Bob didn't not at all understand the sense of those disconnected sentences. To anything that woman alluded, he absolutely had to have the address of Dafne to Paris. 



Speaking of life 
The following day, toward midday, Bob was on a direct taxi to Montparnasse. Reached the civic desired it paid the run and descents from the auto. It was found before a stately complex; reaches the front door it attended impatient the exit of someone. Shortly after it finally had in front of itself the door of the apartment of it Gilds. It was her to open. From the expression of the woman, it was clearly realized that they didn't serve presentations; you/he/she had recognized him/it. After the first seconds of embarrassing silence, it Gilds it broke the ice. 
«Saint sky! From the description had imagined you beautiful, but not so fascinating! It was now that decided yourself to arrive.» 
Gild spiazzato it had him/it; Bob was encouraged for that eccentric reception. 
Dafne was not in the house; you/he/she was spending a few times with the new friend Alizèe, near the cultural association of it Gilds. 
Bob was impatient, but to talk to that woman would perhaps have been able to clarify his ideas, before the prophetic meeting. They took a tea. 
«Well Bob, if you don't regret I know you with this name and I would like to call you so; by now I have accustomed there. Be', then already that there are I immediately invite you to give me of the you.» 
«Any problem Gilds. Do I have to deduce then that Dafne has spoken a lot of me?» churches him, intent to throw back the hair as was usual to do in situations that put him/it to uneasiness. 
«Yes, a lot. I would now like to know why you are really now here. Have you talked to my sister and my brother-in-law?» churches it Gilds with interest. 
«I am here because I know that Dafne has returned in Milan; you/he/she has come from me and you/he/she has seen me kiss another. And worse catastrophe could not happen. I want to know with that intentions you/he/she had returned and I would like to explain her what you/he/she has seen. He/she will never believe me, but that kiss I have not looked for him. But.» 
Bob jammed, not knowing whether to go out of it. 
«But you are always also a man. However I know everything. Interest me to understand what my sister has told you. You know, I would not like to speak of things that you don't know and how alone Dafne has the right to tell you» taken back it Gilds, ignoring some all of this that Bob tried to explain speaking of Cassandra. 
«Be', you/he/she has told me that Dafne had returned for speaking to me, that it perhaps has intention to move here himself/herself/themselves and that he/she believes that I have put with that other. I have to see her/it. I know that I don't have hopes, but I want to try us. You/he/she has seen me kiss a woman with which you/he/she has never gotten along, and that it hates. However I would like to make my state of mind understand her. The felts only me.» he/she explained Bob. 
«And that harpy has taken advantage of it. Don't fear Bob, Dafne is not stupid. He/she perfectly knows that that woman has exploited the situation. And it feels him guilty to have left alone you throwing you among his/her braccias. Sincerely I don't believe that Dafne has to reproach him something, and I believe that your history was already enough incasinatas without owing to add us a liaison with that tizia. However can understand that certain women know how to get what they want, and you are always also a man. know, macaws really two film types you others! How do you think about resolving this thing?» 
«I don't want to do anything else other than to tell Daf that I want to spend my life with her. For me we are to the moment zero. I want here to depart from with her. I need to give a turn to my life, I want to restart. I have made many errors it Gilds, but I don't want to feel me a discard the whole life. I want Dafne with all of my strengths, now or anymore. There is not a correct moment in which he is ready to be together. the people as me and Dafne macaws loved and enough, and they have to be together.» 
It gilds it was touched from that discourse. Bob had pronounced him with transport and conviction. 
«I believe that you are a man intelligent Bob; he feels, it is warned. It is Dafne you/he/she had anticipated him/it to me. Your moment zero has arrived indeed, but unfortunately I is not me that that you have to convince. And I wish indeed me that succeeds in finally reseting the moment, and to restart. It is necessary, as images.» concluded it Gilds. 
Bob didn't do in time to ask nothing on that last affirmation, that the cellular phone of you/he/she Gilds you/he/she interrupted him/it ringing. 
Bob immediately understood that you/he/she Gilds you/he/she had received a very serious call: 
«Attend-moi, j'arrive!» he/she abruptly answered. Then it turned him to Bob with shaken air: 
«Bob was Alizèe. we have to race in the hospital, Dafne is not well.» 
Once in auto Bob stormed you/he/she Gilds of questions. Its look was terrorized. You responded in vague way, explaining him that Alizèe had not gone down in details. 
In the hospital, it Gilds it began to ask information, then last Alizèe, that attracted his/her attention with some signs. The two spoke to French; Bob was not very strong, and you/he/she understood well little. They crossed a long corridor. 
«I can know what is happening? In that department you/they have put her?» 
Arrivals next to the room of Dafne, Gild it stopped a physician and he/she spoke to us a few minutes. Bob was frightened, perhaps you/he/she had never been him/it so much as at that time. When the physician got further you/he/she Gilds apart the takings and he spoke to him in very dry way. 
«You feel Bob, I believe that this thing concerns first you that whoever other. There is now a nurse that a flebo is putting her. It hardly goes out you can enter. Dafne is awake but it doesn't need quarrels and any type of stress; it will be already enough stressful to discover that you are here. Have you understood me well?» it thundered it Gilds with to do maternal. 
«Yes. but because it is here? Has you/he/she been a decrease of pressure an indisposition? What has you/he/she said the guy of first?» churches him with shiny eyes. 
It gilds spiazzata he/she remained from that look. You/he/she had felt speak from his/her niece of it, but to be himself/herself/themselves to few centimeters from that eyes was indeed a strange feeling. 
«You have to go to her, you will see that it will be well and it will tell you everything.» 
The nurse hardly went out, Bob missed the breath. It entered the room. Dafne was unarmed in a hospital bed. It had the closed eyes, its expression was visibly suffering. You/he/she could finally see her/it again; it drew near her with fear. It found her with a long head of hair chestnut dark. It was the first time that he/she saw that long and soft hair of their natural color. At the same time it was agonizing to see her/it in a hospital bed with the terror to discover its motive. Dafne opened the eyes. To that point Bob the runs nearby. You began to cry desperate trying to rise himself/herself/themselves. It began to howl disconnected sentences. 
«Bob are here! You have to tell him him you, have to say to save him/it to him, I beg you Bob, I don't understand if here you/they are doing enough. The implore you Bob.» 
Bob was amazed, and you/he/she understood less and less thing you/he/she was happening. It tried to reassure her/it. It tightened her strong and it tried to make to stretch her/it. You looked at him/it as if it didn't realize to have him/it there yet. At the same time its look begged help, and Bob tried to understand what you/he/she was happening. 
«Love you have to be calm. Am there now me, have you understood me? With whom have to speak Daf? What has my love happened?» he/she asked Bob keeping on tightening her/it. 
«They have to save him/it Bob.è our child! I pray you, have to check that they do everything the possible! I don't want to lose him/it, I don't want! I beg you love, help us.» 
Dafne was in full hysterical crisis. Those it howls they were agonizing. He was stiffened of hit. Its ears had indiscriminately felt the words" our child" and he/she didn't succeed in reacting anymore. It was an unique, even though agitated feeling. It gilds and the physician they entered the room, and only Bob returned at that time in itself. They invited him/it to move himself/herself/themselves, while Dafne kept on begging to help him/it their child to save her/it. The nurse invited all to go out. After a first resistance Bob got further, dragged from you/he/she Gilds. 
«Our child? Has you/he/she said our child? True Dora.è? Does Dafne expect a child?» he/she asked Bob under shock. 
«Yes Roberto, is this way. It had to be her to tell you him; even if I didn't want of some that happened in the hospital.» 
«Be' but do I have to do something, do I have to be with her. you/he/she has begged me to I give everything the possible. The pray you it Gilds, it is not about to lose him/it, true?» 
«Bob you have to calm you. The physicians have everything under control. Dafne would also give the life not to lose this child. You/he/she had already had some problem to the beginning, that it looks like he is ripresentato. You/he/she has been a threatened abortion, you/he/she can happen. But you/they have assured me that it is everything under control. It will have to listen to the physicians to the letter and you will see that everything will be all right. Dafne is alone frightened.» 
Bob nodded. It was stunned. From the happiness of that news you/he/she would be exploded, but the fact that that life was already in danger dragged him/it in an abyss of terror. 
A hour later anybody had still allowed neither to him neither to it Gilds to see Dafne. You allowed to fall on one of the chairs of the corridor: 
«Dafne has ever thought that this child would be able not to be my?» churches him with the turned look to earth, lost. 
«Some that you/he/she has thought of us, but you/he/she has immediately excluded him. It will have his/her certainties, otherwise you/he/she would never have come to look for you. And however a woman these things he/she knows her, trusted. You instead, thing you feel?» 
«I feel that I would like to enter and to tighten my child and she. And I also know to have conceived him/it in the most beautiful night that I will ever succeed to remember: two days before Dafne departed for coming qui.è so.» 
«Then we can say that also a man these things he/she knows her» it commented it Gilds with a warm smile. 
«It gilds, do tell me the truth now: Dafne would ever have told me some child?» churches him withdrawn. 
«Some that would have told you him, Bob. Last night we have spoken for a long time of it. The same wickedness of yours ex wife would never have done you. It loves too much yourself. He/she wanted only to wait for to overcome the third month, and to be less badly for what you/he/she had seen between you and your colleague. It was confused, convinced to have you lost, and he/she didn't want you to return only back because of his/her child. For the time being you/he/she would be transferred here, but then you/he/she would have told you him.» 

Mezz'ora after Bob was finally in the room, reassured by the physicians on the delicate, but stable conditions of Dafne and his/her child. 
His/her doubts and you torment they appeased him to the solo to see her/it. Dafne had the tired air, yet it strove him to hold the eyes open to be able to look him/it at the more possible. He was there finally and the hand tightened her. Anybody question, some sign of explanation. They knew that there was so much to say and to explain, but not there, not at that time. Now they were united from a living being to protect. He abandoned the hand on his/her abdomen; Dafne succeeded in feeling its heat. And for a long time, those of Bob were the most beautiful hands that you/he/she had ever seen and that you/they had ever touched her. 



Speaking of Amanda 
The light of the morning dispersed him weak inside a great stay. The mild air in Paris was penetrated by the great opened window. Bob was extended for earth, on a great carpet. You/he/she could perceive the reflexes of the curtains to stir sinuous on the ceiling. Of sudden its head turned him toward right and its arm it lengthened in the same direction; Amanda crawled verse of him. Bob intensely looked at her/it, then the face grazed her. It brought her itself and they began to play, as every Saturday morning. Its eyes were reflected in identical eyes, those of the most beautiful child that had ever seen. On the that smile furbetto and radiant, Bob didn't have some doubt. He/she perfectly knew from who had picked him up.
