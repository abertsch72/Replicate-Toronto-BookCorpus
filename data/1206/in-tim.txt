    “When you’ll (choose to) read this you will be probably searching for something or someone you need or used to make a need of. Remember though that it is in yourself that very personal-magic power you are looking for to help you build a bridge - be it of rainbows or strings pulled just perfectly yet mysteriously right - to whatever you are searching for. This is only something meant to make you laugh, to make you cry, remember or get a hint and show you that you are not completely alone into this world... perhaps to inspire you to be much more than the lost ‘poor thing’ you sometimes get to feel being or the invincible god that’s forgotten about his or her roots (they should be healthier and brighter, those roots of which we’re sometimes misled into thinking ours, other times illuminated to take heed of.).”

“As you dream of beauty and those better times to come /make come\, 
you do what you have to do
 *relax, hate. love...do something, don’t just stand there, 
feeling useless and helpless because that’s what they want!*
.
making the steps towards what you always wished for
deep down in your soul, your heart, your mind... 
When stuck in a tree-house we plan and we plan our escapes,
all those little escapades, 
our visions, our feelings, ourselves.”

- He doesn’t want us to do what we want or be how we feel; he doesn’t care if this is right or wrong, he simply wants things to be the ways he always wished for, the ways he spoke, his ways or no ways at all! 
* I used to believe in the freedom, of speech and feeling, in the freedom of showing, 
expressing what we believe to be our
legacy. 
A duty to maintain the flame of passions inducing the idea 
of being free.
I used to believe in us
as the luckiest duty, 
the luckiest fee.* 
- I don’t care what he wants! I want what I want and it will be the way I want things to be since I wish for something not sufficiently wrong so it hurt anyone the ways he’s hurting us! 
Two rebels, of one kind, 
two projects of one human type of reasoning. 
.
It starts with a “Do”, just like in a song for children
(the Von Trapp’s having a most wonderful time),
going down for a pleasant walk through the history of music
then up again,
once more on the same dancing and hopping around road
of things for the first time experienced, for the first time felt, 
unexplored yet, coming from some meddle and the mingle of all thoughts... 
(we belong to one another in various forms of synchronicity. 
.
- You were all just simple thoughts to me, in the very beginning of what you so beautifully, 
exquisitely and most wonderfully kept searching a name for and found: 
TIME
.
to you all:
When I’ll live my dream 
 I won’t be needing any sleep, 
the things that I’ll do will find their rest in me 
and I will find my rest in what I will choose doing; 
I will know what to do and I will always do the right thing!

My Poetical (?) Non-sense
.
 Purple Clouds projected on my window,
An image about Love’s consciousness is fleeting!
An image of nothing and all that’s to be, 
the basement of a home entitled “The whole of Me”
..
Feelings and life
.
This legacy was passed to me
Through tears and laughter...
It’s all in History!
Evolving genes are still writing
The destiny of who I am to be.
Feeling open and awake,
still building that fence...
Do you Remember the fence?
We used to call it “My Wall”
Reflection of a childish poetical nonsense!
.
Recurrent thoughts:
I’ll love you, forever
But don’t love me back
Unless you too need it
to make you feel alive.
-We will make it last!  the poor demon cried
Then left.
Recurrent wish:
- “If he will be happy this way then never shall we cross our ways!”

The Story:
So, when she was happy he was feeling sad
But this only lasted for minutes that cut
Some memoir, forgotten, on papers he’d burn
Along with his wishes to be loved in return.
.
She had asked for his joy and happiness full
Throughout all the life of one mortal fool.
And so, he was rescued and lived without her
The happiest moments one could have asked for!
One day he remembered her beautiful wish
and asked for her happiness in all great-fullness.
Awakening one morning,
Great joy in her soul
With no other reason but clouds being born.
.
She’s hearing the crawl of one silent soul
While smelling the tea in her cup made of stone.
The smell of dark coffee is so far away!
Lost back in a time like a painting’s cold stare.
All pain was in frames now, 
Still bound to forget
About this cold good medicine,
The pain’s new amend
“- I will let you be, I will let you live!”
I can only remember through tears in your sky
The flight of the angels
I once cried up and down
The spiral of thoughts and of feelings I had,
Resembling the music with which I was healed.
Reminders of the fights between the demons I wept,
Washed down with the movement lifting up their Faith.
.
Amnesiac hopes born back then are now humming 
.
Like a bee! 
So, rescued I felt! And so well, I was
Free!
...
Amnesiac feelings of pure love, still tempting me.
“-What’s pure though, here, honey? 
My angel! My hope!”
...
Continuing moving with full faith on my spiral
Believing in truths of One God’s Great New Power.
He’ll make it all happen,
So that I have some rest,
A break that’s too kind
From the confusing quest
of some peace
I don’t want enough
Since I keep looking back 
at some old and amusing matters of grip.
They’re one of a kind,
Contradictions in my mind.
.
Remember me now, can you see that poor fence?
We once used to call it “Our Wall” 
Then laugh loud through our tears!
While planting new seeds
Of kindness and care, pure joy, love and blessings
Sprung out of our real understanding!
.
An image of nothing and all that will be, 
the basement of a Home which is
 “The whole of Me”
.
Feeling open, still awake,
I’m building that fence...
.
Reflection of a childish poetical nonsense!
.
Have you heard about Irony?
It is cutting the veins of Eternity!
.
 ..
*Soft Menace, warm Menace, 
Little warning soul!*
..
*I saw you as a beautiful and gracious thing! A woman dancing on her field of love! 
A grave, perhaps, of someone else’ tears,
forgotten hopes and dreams
that were all left behind.*
.
In T[I’M]
.
Among Grand Trees which have seen a lot
I heard the echoes of your smiles
Cast upon this pot of Dreams…
I dream among the clouds of hopes
That lost grand battle against their freedom-hall.
.
One Time, More Fractional Illusions
I heard the echo of your smile
Against all odds!
Such comfortable Reason 
For my soul to be lifted-up!
Above,
‘am seeing echoes of your sights
and Treason.
.
Beyond these trees which have seen a lot,
Beyond these smiles and sighs,
Beyond the sight of Faith
In shadows of a plot,
I run a lot!
This Soul of Time, the shadow I am running from,
My own, it is,
Myself,
My soul…!
.
This Time has always felt faint echoes in our lives.
~ Why am I running, now? ~
Forsaken, do remember this Ant Reason!
Beyond this bending Time
And times that felt enough just right,
In spaces where enough was not enough to smile,
Where canvases of the good and kind
Lost tales of green, the greens were all the ground;
Still pawned…
Among warm times
Forgotten in some picture
We’re turning sounds alive…
.
We watch, we see, we touch but never learn too much!
.
~ only the necessary ~
?
in times of war
illusions of their honour, love and freedom
brought back
the life
into the blood of those who had no colour!
In times of wars and fights, deceiving thoughts on glory, praise and power
Drained life out of
The blood of those with colour.
.
A Frame of moments, fractional
.
~ an end in all Beginnings ~
.
all souls in one shall gather,
true colours facing colours on some other grade
being all light
and soon becoming Times’ new dark and thirsty
empty hollow.
.
Watch pictures echoing those trees which have seen a lot!
~
We’re just illusions of our times
And Time is our delirious delusion!
~
Watch out the mirrors of your sound,
The echo is just one
Illusion of their freedom;
Recycled times by Time!

Chaos, Cronos and their Love,
Dear Space,
debate and play
Around.
.
Reached my hand to touch the game-board...
Escape in a World of Dreams,
This
Made her re-think the position of her entire being
on his shield.
.
Reached your hand to save her 
from her much loved solitude!
..
Worlds in a feel, a heart’s plenitude!
...
We’re nothing but the dream of all the worlds we dream
About... cold tears,
In blood, they trust!
Ways of a fight to kill.
.
She reached her hand to stop those cold-blooded murders
of your pen!
But your knights have fought her and won...
on paper!
.
- Dear colleague Time, said mother Space,
We have so much to say to human race!
- Disgrace! his smiling answer.
- Their sorrow is the way to cold display of their feelings!
- I agree Dear Space! 
But look away...
They both smile their way,
Their thoughts create another day.
.
But Chaos didn’t like to feel them get along so well...
- Too close, he said.
A Touch, One Turn
and there was Time, 
exiled to the secluded
 Man-kind’s Land.

Exchange of feelings and of hopes
Forgotten on the wings of rope’s
Conclusion.

It’s snowing light!

Sparkling fights over that rainbow 
are happening!
I can see through your window...
Seclusion.
Break free...!?
-Don’t worry! I will be your friend for as long as you need me!

These selves of myself,
All stars that are gone

On bees that are humming,
On dark melodies,
On lights, all surrounding 
The cities’ new entries;
On wings that look desperate
To burn a new thought
Of whispers that mattered 
in a time of a god
that didn’t quite matter 
for you or for him...
That god was living and fighting inside you. 
You didn’t see through;
That god was inside me
And did help us too!
* 
And now
....
...The shame of being who I am... 
This Holy Shame!
..
.
.
*I know that I come from a place where I was hated and loved enough to be punished for both feelings. Do you know how it is, how it feels to be forced to pay for the hatred and grudge held-up against you for the same reasons they never change producing pain and suffering to anyone they feel that stands in their ways to what you have, to what you earned, to what was given, kindly offered to you, with love? Do you know how it feels to feel punished for the good-luck that finally came, after dealing with a lot of pain, being sent back to those days of nightmares and struggle with the demons which shouldn’t be fought by anyone alone? It was funny a moment, seeing that there is this new way of making things a little bit more bearable for me so you had fun, one more time, on the expense of those who trusted the ideal, the idea speaking of helping people through by the means and possibilities received.*
 .
Another one for the home
.
For everything taken away from you, by force,
more strength and the power to earn a lot more
someplace else - on the other side perhaps, an answer and your much loved call to action! 
For everything you lost for another one, you’ll get repaid. 
For everything you offer with love,
true love will you be offered and something beautiful 
more beautiful than taken away, by any mean, in any way! 
Be blessed with the ideal of love which can and will be true.
To the one who’s still seeking for the ideal, of love that is true!
.
In the mood for hope, my dear!

Machines to help you with your story,

And some more money to help!

… someone …
(a nobody)
some one
(a fool)
a nobody’s someone
(and someone’s just a nobody)

Machines for laughter and for sorrow,
Some other machines for cinder and joy 
to follow a panegyric path.
Rebirth of machines and story-whistles,
Some great strong machines you thought they might use so!
Be so!
… you say …
Machines that discovered that they were once someone
Before being sent killing human dreams and hopes
For a new world!
Some dreams to make a soul
Feel comfortable with the life it’s chosen;
Out of nowhere, out of blues and violets that look adorable
They got to sing!
.
~ !Sing out! ~
.
Machines to cry-out their love and their truths,
Rebirth of the visions of a living star in yourself!

The relic of another myth 
For which there’s proof of living.

“I should have evolved first and just then starting to follow a star!”
“Night-time falls in peace with the infinite...”
“While daylight appears to find ways to the treat of your minds.”
“As the darkness gets suddenly cut by the cold lamp’s light in the corner of my spot...”

“...touched by the honey in the storage room...”
“... brought there with the love and care one will always need ...”
“... as best friend, my lover ...”

“They find children to eat, to lead to the perfection of their work - a masterpiece! They find children to haunt and to terrify by night or day, they are looking for children-spirit to feed with every time they need to rest in peace. They steal children, your children, they eat their souls and they become better and better, they’re loved! - Will those spirits take revenge after their night gone? Will those children escape from their chains and their bombs and their nightmares and their crawls into in-existence? ‘It is my time to live, dear aunt! It’s my time to be out of your nightmares, out of your cold-blooded world, mom! It is my time to grow, dear father! My time to be someone!’ 
They each children for breakfast, they eat their pure lovely souls and spit them back at the world as poisons and pills for you to train once more; entities to put to your service. They ask to be treated as gods!”

The unjust justice
.
He helped me feel like a normal human, 
he helped me go through the hardest waste of time to take, 
He was there when I needed him, 
They were there, all of them, 
He helped me through my darkest times, 
the way he could.
Now happy
I am!
You got tired of fighting again and again.
.
this unjust justice against the past,
against the future that could have last 
for some time
... ever ...
               ...
The three dots in a row 
.
In a world that’s so obviously
born out of the darkness
of one soul...
.
A wormhole,
A stare,
.
A new life begins...
                               elsewhere!
You helped me feel like a normal human, 
You helped me go through the hardest waste of time to take, 
You were there for me in my times of need,
in those of despair and weakness; 
They were there, all of them. 
He helped me through my darkest times, 
You helped me the ways you could.
Now you’re in.
Welcome.
.
The same old yet so new!
A place where only fools keep wander? 
[Questioning everything]
You’re here!
You funk your happiness
because you’re afraid
of your own politeness!
..
Fundamentally true, 
                               fundamentally you!

The Finest Hypocrite
.
The light of the sun is beautifully casting upon the streets of the town,
The buildings all around,
Thanks, God for the warm caressing sun!
.
The greatest Hypocrite I am
The biggest cheat and lie,
But see, all hypocrites just get to kill or die.
.
And losers are the ones who feel for real;
Why feel for anybody here?
.
Why care, why bother why just not believe!
believe in - shhh {ut}...IT - glory, in whatever
you are doing?
.
Why bother, care for others if you just get...
- Oh, I ought to do that!
.
One smiley face, ‘cause this is how things work!
Into the world of facebook, business... human thing! (?)
.
Why be so crazy and believe in good?
Why learn from others?  ... how you should succeed!
Why do it well, and with a pure good heart?
[ Naivety]
Why not let their infections bother you along?
.
The whys can be so infinite, my friend!
Just let me breath myself out of this cunning spin.
.
I did it!
I am Me!
I am some star! The galaxies could bother look down
On.
.
At this moment in one time,
one sky, two separated yet together lives.
.
I’m FINE! 
God, bless you all, sweet dust is yet to come!

A tear to be dropped
.
The silence that gives back your freedom
is the one in which lies what you’re needing
and what you were given.
.
They’ll all try to make you feel better,
Feeling worse only because
you are not envious.
.
They will try to make you a human
.
Don’t be like me, darling,
it’s horrible!
.
To be punished for good things that you’re doing
and made listen to spreading wishes they don’t care about...!
To wish for others to do what you once dreamed of
Because they’d rip you off
your gifts
and your soul
claiming that you didn’t know
how to appreciate what they couldn’t bother for;
then, when they saw what you could make out of nothing:
-Oh, wow! I want that! I want her!
that love!...
.
{get back your everything}
.
this new Jesus they’re making of you
is not what you should be
{give: hope?}
.
!just breathe!
.
and feel happy with what and who you are,
‘cause nothing lasts forever
clichés, to have fun!
 .
..
Seeds of Trust
.
Happy Sadness if you must,
Live some sorrow of the past,
.
Happy living memories
Recycling your sweetest stories!
Making something beautiful
Out of things too sorrowful!
.
Destiny is yet to strike,
Make your living worth a while.
.
Worth for someone and for you,
Worth for me and the igloo
I have made just to have fun (?)
In my mind, I travel far!
.
Innocence was found in you,
happy moments helped you through,
dark old days you fought too well...
.
Never should you feel ashamed
for the human that you were
.
Never should you cause me pain
 + 
you’re that wonder of a star
shining just because you are
here or there
you’re part of it
brightly showing to succeed.
Light the path for them to land
and make sure to use the sand 
to make beautiful new homes
for the ones, you’re needing...
Form!

Square Issues
.
A Square,
A Stare
and a nightmare to wake-up from. 
“The key was what I kept looking for!”
.
So, here’s the piece of paper,
Square!
Decision: make use of that world
I once felt so trapped by;
a box of bouncing miracles going round
and round 
around, 
we moved into.
.
Thinking full circles
Were spirals which crawled
Out of the centre
Of One
Piece of Paper
For which I learned I cared.
That spiral which was drawn
By my movement
Went along with and against
My Time.
.
I want back there, where I felt I belong!
.
Still dancing, falling up and down
One Square made of Paper
I have learned to call
The Illusions’ Home.
.
Ordered decision:
Breaking out from it all!
With eyes that look too scared
To see that
I am
…
Breaking the Square!
.
The descent into this real world
Became soon painful.
..
“The key is what I look for!”
The key out of here!
‘The key to the entrance where I can take a real opportunity
to make something good and beautiful happen.’
.
(Oh, child, if you knew what’s to happen!)
..
It’s time
For me to learn
How to control
My tears of Square’s
Much sharpened hollow.
.
“I hope that key will help me snare
The cruelty of edges all too fierce
Of my Square Tears!”

-Die! Die! Die!
-Hurt us! Please do hurt us!
-I feel sorry for you, dear!
-Go ahead, hurt us again!
-Die! Die alone!
-You, together, alone!
-Oh, I’m sorry!
.
Feeling forced to feel sorry for you! 
I wish you didn’t feel at all! 
I wish I felt nothing at all! 
Just like before: Burn it all!
Feeling sorry for I got forced into hating you!
.
-They’re sorry for you!
-Go ahead, hurt them!
-Again?
.
-Lie! Lie! Lie!
-You will die…
-Alone!
-Live with us because we like you!
-Like me some more!
-Lie! Lie again!
-Together.
-Protect me again!
-Oh, brother!
~
-Is this past a new future or the future one past, all wrapped-up in this beautiful present we call our life?
-I am not mad at you, know this! I’d kill you with my love though!
-Oh, darling! I’ve been missing your sarcasms, do know!

~ When diving too deep into your thoughts 
Dissecting your soul into good little parts
Finding more answers than willing to learn
Hopes become shadows of what’s meant to burn. ~

Eight Forever:
Traces of Paint on the skin,
Lovely mornings
                                soon to come in my dream,
Some calls in life ... and the call!
True: Love is what we ask for...
but what are we willing to give?
steps: four...
Forever Eight:
A new life to begin this evening;
In a cup of tea, I am looking:
T H e r e I Am!
It’s late for me!
.
informative glance: computer shows eleven...
                                                                       p.m.
some sort of a prayer: I.a.”Take my pain away with that song of a sorrow I will never truly understand...
Hopefully!” 
:dreaming-pill:

Something like the pain that I have known and wanted gone
                                 Forever
                         (is it for too long?)
                      Out of our life-dream!
                                  : I.b. “Take away my pain with non-sense that makes sense 
                                                                                                                        only to us!”
:dream sequence:
No one else to wander,
No one to show our slumber
into faded sounds
of the grey shades of colours in a memory of feelings
once intense!
:awakening sequence:
Full of hoping dreams 
in blacks and whites
caressed by shades 
of their own greys
I wonder
WHERE
...
?
Present:
.
Here’s my sleep in black and white 
with tints of complements and colours of your skin:
Forever Eight
&
Eight Forever
in colours of the truths of different natures.
.
Looking for proves...
A glance at the moment:
People believing, they think!
.
*8*
.
Love is what they kill 
every day
Yet love is all they need!
*
We’re okay!
Say
...
..
In Time and thyme again
.
I was born yesterday
when troubles only seemed to be away,
brought back somehow
by the wisdom of your spirit...
by a thoughtful gesture, 
a nice old smile of reconciliation
with an old mind 
or by the memory of something ancient enough not to be feared,
something not to avoid
more than we should. 
.
I was born yesterday, 
do know the truth about who you are now, who you always were,
about myself, the aspirations to something new, 
renewed...
perhaps not the best idea of all.
I was and am the truth you couldn’t bear to watch ruined,
the one about myself you wouldn’t ruin for yourself; 
about our past and what we meant by future life and lives
we’ll speak and sing together, 
we’ll do those ‘whatever’ poems and songs...
whip and weep
forever
in the hearts and minds of anyone who’d live.
.
About those times of beauty, left behind, all washing out and pouring down our needs on worthy people,
the ones who wouldn’t bother to get up for the upper streets that make them wanderers forever
with no futures to think about
dreaming only about what they could have had,
about what they once had
but asked to forget about.
.
Not sad, only mad, at peace with what I’m supposed to do;
still full of hopes that are as foolish as a rose’s stubbornness to bloom
when there’s nothing better seen and appreciated
than the strong perfume of a great collaboration
based on the wishes of all those fools
everybody wants to become. 
.
What makes me more special, what makes you think that I’m too good
to be true? 
What makes you believe that I do not need anything at all? 
Why did it feel like regret?
Why was I so sad 
and where am I going from here? 
You like us kind and gentle like fluffy sheep.
I like that too... they seem to be very kind and generous to me. 
.
These wars, these arguments, these thoughts: why am I restless?
Don’t want to know? 
We’ll never be at peace until I’ll get to learn just HOW. 
..
I do not like to be fluffy and warm, 
I don’t appreciate this twist and switch, this turn; 
I’m wild: this is who I was, this is who I’ll ever be and like being!
..
I can be gentle and very kind
without being somebody else,
without the cruel ugly killing, without committing murder
or creating new sorrows for the poor!
I’m sorry if you think in other terms!
Not sorry to have bothered more for them!
.
With too much kindness you will be killed
if you have killed.
...
*
-What was it? curiosity strikes again: 
Were you concerned about me doing my duty too well?
Were you felling attacked by the possibility of me getting somewhere with who I always felt to have been?
Were you in need to rise above us all? 
Did you feel like being the one to have it all?
Were you afraid to lose what you had 
for someone like me? 
What was it? You needed to tell me about the wisest things on earth 
as if I didn’t know them;
wasn’t I applying them well, 
all those theories on how I should behave...?
we should behave. 
.
-What was it? The need to rule the world, 
to create something beautiful instead
and a punishment for the dead old poem
of a friend in need? 
-That’s stupid, do not be more than you should: 
someone who doesn’t care about anyone anymore
Since they’re all doing just fine
with or without you! 
*
How is it not feeling wanted or loved?
How is it not getting to feel useful anymore
and why did you have to put the blame on somebody else? 
Did you think you were teaching the lesson of cherishing and enjoying life
to the right and righteous ones? 
Did you believe you were nice and kind enough to the ones you’d take everything from
and let die, dry down under the sun of the most revengeful summer!
Did you believe that were going for being too stupid not remembering, giving-up our fears
and work for a better future: this fantasy of mine involving the future
and a future, kind!
Did you believe that we were going to stand just for nothing in return!?
Well, you were wrong! 
*
We all want more than we say we do, 
we all work for more.
We all walk and learn, 
we all share and we all care for something more than what we can see
here,
there,
anywhere we might set our grounds to, set a foot on, 
one land...
anywhere we might walk, talk and listen to our hearts!
anywhere we may say a prayer
or simply send a good thought for some nice humours.
Everywhere we go you share beauty with all your heart open
and see if we care...
our cold attitude is the one to lose it all
in the end!
This is all about you regaining your beauty in its entirety!
.
Transform the ugly and the poor in something beautiful!
Make beauty look into the eyes of beauty and recognize each-other!
seeing themselves as the ones they always were: 
more than they wanted to see or know about. 
Transform the ugly and the poor in something beautiful 
with the
rich spirit that they hold dear to: 
its’ shared, much loved and cherished! 
It’s warm and hot and cold
just like you need it to be!
It’s that everything you always wished to become
when nothing went wrong;
it is that thing you wished to become 
when everything was making you go through hard times
you most certainly didn’t deserve a trade for a curious thought
you should remember now...
an ugly gesture 
not to have done. 
.
Be wild and strong and crazy as you were
and learn.
Be proud, be amazing, be great;
be what they wanted you to be, just don’t be too awesome and great a spirit!
Don’t be too amazing a human being; 
don’t try to come back to our planet again
since you’re filthy,
we’re not!
As filthy as I am you probably are! 
We’re done now! 
I learned, you listened and took a decision too bad. 
I am only sorry to have met this dead end. 
...

How nice a thing
.
Oh, how nice a thing to know
that I do not exist to just about anyone, 
Oh, how nice and wonderful, 
such a relief 
to know that there is still time for me to discover a world
I never had the chance to know before. 
.
Do I know that right now it is all about roses that are black and white?
Did I understand this miracle of life?
Still, as I’m moving around here, haunting the past for its remnants
that excite my imagination,
a long put down, perhaps broken maybe restored beauty inside,
is lifting my head up to the sky to remember that something my spirit got lit from! 
 .
Around here, the wait for a spring regret
offers the air reigned by some smoke that’s not much appreciated
by the lungs that keep asking me to protect them. 
.
In wait for a clue, I’m asking for the poetry inside to rise again
under this crystal globe we learned; it is just okay to take it as a blob of magma covered with some crust
 on which the oceans have created  
lands and seas;
the oceans have produced diversity. 
.
In motion, survival issues to be studied and rewarded, 
Academies to be perpetuated
up on the chains of R_evolutionary thinking. 
Above, the chains are breaking, re-linking,
restoring their shiny old glory 
under the coating of The New;
renewed histories in an inventive scorn,
Patty K One.
.
I know
- do I know? - 
that eventually I’ll get to be broken once more.
I know, I’ve been doing the same thing,
confessing it all for too many times, 
but I keep wishing for a different destiny trap
- one that my pride wouldn’t get too hurt by so it produced more damage around - 
I know - do I know? - I should know by now
that I will cry once more, 
be broken like before
But at least I’ll be able to say 
that I also had some good time!
I also offered some nice enough smiles and smiling acts of betraying 
the Lord of Misery and Pain. 
(that would be betraying myself again)
In fun times, when funny times were simply okay
I’ll draw back this human thing I keep claiming to be,
no matter what you say or think about me,
no matter what you do,
forget me, rather than pity me!
.
-Splendidly spectacular, well spent futures you’ve thrown into the past,
times that worth a lot more 
than repeated billions of dollars filling your accounts 
but emptying your souls and draining your spiritual valuables 
for the fame that won’t mean a thing 
if 
you do not value the human brilliant love
for the Holy Traveller(s)
You’re all dependents to, 
with or without your knowledge; 
with or without your will! 
(oh, aren’t I lovely, a child?)
* 
No poem for you, there’s no poem for your evil genius mind
using your gift to prevent the beauty of human kind
to progress with no damage, 
no harm done to those 
too proud 
to become something disgusting and ugly, 
much uglier than the angel of Death himself! 
.
No poem for you, there’s no poem for you, 
You do not deserve it! 
Try not to think about how to love anyone and do it!
Try not to bother for Him, he’s not worried!
Try not to bother for Her! She’s not worried at all!
Try not to think about how to hurt those who hurt you,
they are not worthy of your time and money,
energy spent on something that wasn’t lovely 
for the mighty-strong ones and lonely. 
* 
If you feel that sorry for me, 
how come the only thing that you do is informing me
about your feelings? 
What should I be doing, now? 
Save you!? 
Show you some mercy, the lack of my pride?
Show you then that I can be a little proud
since you would not take just about anything from...
- not from me, not from another human being;
not even from a little animal grown ferocious to these days. 
.
-I do want more than this!
What seems to be wrong? 
Are you going to lose everything that you are?
What If I will improved? 
Is it something that you’ll miss or be forced to give-up to? 
.
Tough training getting it out of me, 
I’m letting it out - TO YOU! 
Yes! TO YOU: this time I’m not blind! 
You keep us down while you get higher and higher
living your wonderful lie that’s become your truth now! 
From a lie to a lie, to another high lie
tall and all-knowing! 
.
You’re filthy rich and you know it;
you care not for the famished or any famine;
You gave-up to your souls and managed to teach us all how to do that!
- should I bother to ask myself why, now? - 
- do I have to? - 
If you couldn’t convince us to willingly do wrong
you did it for us
and now who’s to blame, who’s to blame?
Your work, indeed: amazingly evil - annoying a spectacle to those like us.
.I was just showing.
How could I fall in love with all that? 
.Showing just how it Shows.
I’m falling in love though with the idea of fighting against it! 
Too bad I couldn’t make peace with this sorrowful link. 
too bad I could not regret a thing 
of what I’ve been saying. 
MEAN
.
Next time I will be mean
since being kind and nice brought me more pain than promised. 
.
There is no God strong enough to teach us the hard lesson
that He Himself taught to His people!
So never regret who you are
as long as you are keeping your spirit alive
carrying the flame inside with you.
.
BURN, BURN, BURN them all if that’s what you need!
Burn them or leave them behind with their game!
There will be a time when they will all die forever. 
.
Just try not to make me belong to a god that’s too cruel to care for what’s right or wrong
in this world! 
Just try to do that once more!
It will turn you and your entire world up-side down!
- perhaps the same way you tried to do with mine? maybe just some way! - 
Go high!
.
Now this is not a promise, not a countdown, not a game!
This is how all things will get to you and put an end to the misery of your soul. 
The  Certainty of a Strong Call!
..

In the corner of the room, darkened by the spirits of the man and the woman claiming to be the parents, a child was watching through them seeing all the hatred and resent unbearable and ugly; why the hate, why this crave of theirs for harming another human? Why this thirst for their souls? Why this pleasure of injuring someone? Why do they punish people? Why do they apply these cruel treatments to other beings? And why to me, their only child? 
- Here, drink this potion!
- No! 
- Drink it! It’s for your own good! 
- No! 
- Drink it, I say...
- Nothing bad is going to happen to you! 
- Last time you said this I almost died of dehydration! No! I won’t drink it! 
- Look, child! You have to drink this or else...
- I will stop being the subject of your twisted evil experiments right now! 
- Evil experiments? What are you talking about!?
- I know what you’re doing, witch! I know what you’re both up for! I heard something last night and I decided not to be part of it anymore.
- Child, this is for your own good! 
- This is for the good of the entire world! 
- No! I don’t care! I don’t care about the world! Screw your thoughts about the world! Screw your world! I’m out of here! 
And so the child, in a burst of angry pushes, twists and turns, grabbed a jacket and a pair of shoes left with some inspiration to his immediate reach and stormed right out the door. Nothing was heard of him again in those places but much got to be felt after he got himself rescued by the world he needed to understand and learn he was an important part of: the world of magic, science and miracles (one he thought he’d free himself from, one day, until the moment of truth; until he learned about his place and found his peace, equilibrium and desired energy to focus and accomplish his destiny.) - a world complete and beautiful enough for one to wish to fight for against those many wishing for it to be destroyed; a world in which dangers and dangerous minds weren’t allowed to make beauty and kindness disappear forever; a world where the beauty of competition and war was not something leading to a tragic event. A world for us all together, forever, accepting one another and ourselves for what we are and what we fought to be and become. It was the world in which the child learned the dosages of so called potions and potions to take and combine for the road; it was the end of the coldness inside and the fear of becoming The One for them all, despite all the enemies, despite all her charm under-cover; under the cover of someone beautiful he took revenge on the unworthy, evil and dangerous people - the so called stupid. 
.
Seek in yourself the answers to your questioning! 
Seek in your mind the memories that have brought you to this state of living a lie! 
Seek deep down in your  little world, go down, explore all the worlds
you once lived in and learned of. 
Learn now!
Seek now, into yourself, around yourself is everyone just basically the same. 
Go, seek the answers, the feelings and the thoughts to be combined, revealed;
go, seek, find answers - puzzling or not - and come back to show more of the ways of expression perceived
as the deal. 
..
I hate this past you sentenced me to, dear! 
I hate it so much, right now, can’t you feel? 
...
-You can kill a body but not the spirit itself! You ugly fighters!  You will never win!

To which spirit you choose to belong to? 
the clear voiced the bell of translucidities, 
charmed.

Sometimes!
We need some times
to

A short ode to...
.
Poetry: where my spirit burns and thunders! 
Poetry, where my soul wanders!
Poetry and music, 
Painting and expressions 
of 
those humans, kind, as we, rejected from the dangers of our hell, were.
Poetry, showing my dearest enemy,  hiding the loveliest friend!
Poetry, our lonely and only  true friend.
.
You’re poetry to me, my loveliest dear friend,
 and you don’t want to know about it,
don’t even want to hear about it, now. 
You must have grown too tired
or they must have eaten you alive. 
.
... Seriousness 
Alive...
.
Listen to yourself. You know what to do! 
You will fell what’s the right thing to do! 
Don’t listen to their infamous prides
despising you for not following blindly their say, 
their words, 
the ugliness of their spirits, cunningly trying to mislead you! 
Don’t listen to them! Listen only to yourself and what’s helpful to you! 
.
Alive...

The Twisted Hedonist
.
A way, a place, a land that you seek
Recreating from your mind 
using what was broken, got shattered or buried in the sand, 
using the memories of angels and demons who created 
the perfect fights for you to either become evolving or die; 
Hedonisia is the land you all seek! 
Holy shall it be made, 
so you can feel and think 
no matter what. 
- you’ll make it matter for you or for another one if not for yourself - 
-You! Make us matter for yourself, now!
.
out of pride or out of dignity?
Who knows better than you
.
Lord? 
.
Save or kill me!
.
Holier it is to live your life in peace
than do the killing, appropriate as it sometimes feels
to be; 
killing those who always killed
for the murderers out there who wouldn’t bleed, wouldn’t even think of it
- aren’t they smarter than anyone else on this Planet? -
 .
Hedonist purposes managing feelings and fears, orchestrating the killing,
murderous savings: they are holier than the ones set by your mind, 
perfect, as you were:
The mind of a creator.
 .
All hedonists trying to kill that perfection, 
judging, misjudging, learning, reforming;
rejoining perfected mirrors, 
making perfection out of imperfect killing;
all these tries of yours, these tries of mine, 
made this nonsense of a world become possible.
.
Loving terms of highs and bios: 
this perfect world where we can hate one another in peace and harmony! 
Don’t you love it!? 
How...? Do you like my perfect lying compound stand?
Never-mind! I don’t even know what I’m saying right now.
.
Is it the fever?
Is it the headache?
Is it because I lost all my faith in you?
When will I learn not to bother and just move with the flow of time?
‘Should have learned it by now!
.
..
Reciprocity 
.
What you see now, on this face
is the result of what you did for me.
Oh, dear! Thanks!
.
- Yes, thank you! - 
I didn’t expect anything this nice from your end; 
yet you’ve been most wonderful! 
.
                                                                                               A friend.
*
When ... when... when... 
Feeling like something to be disposed of; 
it’s been hurting and bleeding inside,
aching and craving for answers for longer a time than you might think as possible:
“So what, so what! said the world! So what!”
Their signs weren’t satisfying at all... 
Now I’m learning and learning... things about myself that I wanted forgotten, some buried...
“It is much easier to burn them all inside and let out only what’s gained the best shape possible”
when... when... when... 
“I’ve been trying to find that inner flame... that inner flame is hiding now and I still don’t know who to blame!” 
‘Ran faster and much heavier a pace,
saint furious mistake of messing with the devil, 
saint poison through my veins: to think that I was grateful for not knowing! 
Always been grateful for the times when sorrow leaves your heart;
Always been grateful for my learning-feelings times... always too grateful. 
.
..
When will I learn... oh, when? 
Please, pace yourself and watch it carefully, 
Don’t fly too high when you’re not ready, 
Don’t do the same mistake as I did: 
Be sure that you are ready. 
.
 Do, pace yourself, watch out! be careful...
Don’t fly too high when too soon,
make sure that you are ready for the mistake of your life:
the troubling fight for what you thought and felt to be our freedom.

*
One ugly fact: As dangerous as The Light! 
The feminist note-pad messages I’ve sent: No sorrow, no regrets!
“You let my boys be happy or else!” what can I say!
.
Don’t sorry!
..
 “I have upset an entire world and now I expect things to calm down and see our woods and our people resting happily as I do something for a dream.” 
.
One dream at a time, 
I need that world of mine to mean something. 
I need that dream of mine to be beautiful! I need it true! Will you help me?
And so, she promised to herself to help herself and get where she always wanted to be. 
And, so he did the same; now what do you expect from me? What is there to happen?

The Importance of being important
.
Importance issues, important you are.
Importance is fun: you don’t matter! Do matter, please!
You do matter to this world, to your son, to your daughter! 
You do matter to your mom’
You matter to someone!
Somebody will care for you, one day. 
Somebody will care! 
.
You are important to me, my child! Be proud!
Please be prouder of yourself and who you are! 
.
Learn how to be proud.
Be sent an angel to help you somehow, when in need!
rise from that decadence 
you were sentenced to!
 .
Be sent an angel, be sent some sign and a friend, 
Be sent the help you needed.
Please, rise above your situation and be a respectable human. 
 .
Advice from a coward that claims to be your friend
this way. 
 *
-Be proud! You were really good at this game! 
Really good! 
*
Be proud enough not to have lost now everything you fought for! 
Be proud enough not to let yourself ruined and crushed
by the very powerful who wouldn’t mind losing you!
forever, if they could.
.
-God, the sound of her voice really tells me about how much she cared! 
How much she cares!
Oh, wow! 
 .
If you do, I do and we do create that fantastic world to be built: together... accomplishing better dreams, greater perspectives, a million thousand years 
of repeating the beauty in the one you were! 
Built-up yourself! Get up and built-up your strength!

*
A healer in need, a healer indeed is what we need,
a healer to help in my times of sorrow and regrets.
A healer I wish to be when necessary, 
A healer through the art that I am applying... now breathe!
Couldn’t you hear me laughing at a good joke?
Couldn’t you laugh at a good one too?
Weren’t you able to be there for me as I was for you?
to you, I’m dead with the poems of the life I imagine: 
a fighter I am! A fighter for that idea of freedom to be gained. 
.
Importance issues, important you are.
Importance is fun: you do matter!

By the Time of Legends
.

The princess and her castle, 
an overrated story
that catches eyes and spirits
in front of the screens of cinema and television: 
A ticket out, is magic! 
Just never to forget: 
the ride, the learning passage
of dead towards the dead. 
A live come-back to life,
you’re feeling now alive!
.
Buy yourself the time of legends
and of human super-heroes,
buying motionless desire,
buying motives’ great new owl.
Find again the greatest sky-sign
telling you that mice might be around,
feeling though that logic’s being defeated 
by the greatness of a sentiment
pushing to
asking your why’s...
Why do I feel this way, now? 
Why am I so fascinated about...?
Oooh! That’s why!

But what did I do to deserve this? 
Did I kill you?
Did I curse you?
Did I confront you with the greatest nightmares
provoked by the actions of your bodies? 
Did the wheel turn
and, when that happened,
who else was there to be blamed
for the sorrow and the pain?
oh! Were your wishes to rule
no matter the consequences,
no matter the deal? 
.
The princess and her castle, 
a knight in shiny armour, buffoons and clowns, 
three or four mimes,
an overrated story, some say. on the streets of a glorious city.
Fine times of fun catching the eyes and spirits
in front of the screens,
inspiration taken for plays transposed into journeys; 
travelling from paper to different unit-machines, 
through melody and knowledge
of every  kind of beauty
you’re into.
A paper-back sketched hour
for cinema , TV and online freedom. 
.
A ticket out - it’s magic! 
A thing not to forget: 
the ride, the learning, the passage
of some dead towards the dead. 
A live come-back to life,
you’re feeling so alive!
Alive to live among the living,
together in a perfect lie.

It’s all in your head! 
Your head! 
My head!

Our heroes will help us, 
a good soul is brave
and braver that soul becomes
each and every day.
.
In training, in prayer, 
in gestures of hope;
the ones of true kindness and hate towards all things
they find hurtful.
.
I’ll find what I need and I want wherever I go;
what I want will become a mystery to you all.
What I’m searching for is something you will never learn from me
nor from the signs and whispers, 
the tales and gossiping.
..
-You will never know what I want, 
You will never hurt me again
knowing how to put an end to the happiness and joy of my spirit,
this soul of mine! 
this soul; 
you will never hurt us 
for being or not being as we were told.
..
In schooling, in spirit,
meditation and work,
in gestures of kindness that stand-up and fight against all things
our heroes known as hurtful in real life. 
..
Can you believe I still believe that I’m not the only one?!

A lover he once had, 
once (upon a time, a lifetime *#*once upon a dream)
and he was missing her like nobody else; 
the lady who created his lively dream was real,
but she was ill... 
with sorrow. 
.
Once, he had only, 
once upon a time-line.
The lady who created her didn’t even realised...
what for.

Disappointment Track

“This disease called happiness I wish I could infect an entire deserving world with!”

1. Perhaps!
 Much Better Now 
.
I just had to tell some more about her feelings;
less would have been, perhaps, much better!
.
-There is time for laughter and there is time for fun, 
there is time for a teardrop to fall down those words of mine, 
Pretending or not to be healing or killing what went wrong.
Will I ever be wrong!? 
Aren’t I just about now!?
There are so many questions, so many thinking ways, 
a scientist’s waiting to be loved again, 
a scientist who got arrested and feels he’d like to, 
she’ll love to, she’d just love to come back and be helpful
to you! 
*
You will never judge me!
so wrong, much too wrong,
for the things that I’m doing, for those things I have done; 
to speak well about the dangers, the truths and our lies, 
our lives got completed due to the foaming sparkle someone thought that you were.
Weren’t you much more!?
Aren’t you there!?
Wasn’t I pretending that everything went well
just for you
not to suffer, 
please don’t suffer anymore!
I am tired, too tired of bringing flowers and beauty to graves, 
I’d rather take care of our homes instead
- something not wished for
but acknowledged to be needed...
.
I felt we were living in hell...
sometimes beautiful, romantic,
some other times going down to where I wanted us out of
some time ago. 
 .
I will never find a way to speak well of those dead people doing it wrong, 
but I did, didn’t I? Aren’t I ? there are minds trying to understand how to make them okay, 
how to get into their brains.
.
-How to fix them, how to work myself out of this awful place...?
~sick and demented, that’s how they are, my demons! he confessed~
-I’m tired of these ‘special cases’! Don’t you have some better ones? 
-Just in case you’ll get there... where you needed; do know that whoever cared
doesn’t feel the same (for you) way anymore. 
.
Who cared if I needed, whatever I might have dreamed of, hoped or worked for? 
Who cared!? 
.
‘Why couldn’t you be a good friend?’ - this question’s too stupid for myself 
not even bothering for an answer thrown in the aether
to the hungry for a fight,
be it a friendly or a family’s light
quarrel.
-I will mind my business;
I know what you wanted and why! I know it, I guess that this is one last teardrop 
stupid enough to rise-up
 into my eyes and speak-up!
I couldn’t help it! I loved you! 
Just kill me for that!
.
A sense of purpose and meaning is what you need! 
A sense of importance in this sea of meek people. 
mild striped strings and powerful dreams to feed our hearts and our spirits!

The Soldier of Mercy
.
A soldier of mercy he was, 
and he cried, he cried, believe me, he cried so much
for what he had to do,
for his cowardry,
for not dying instead of killing her. 
“What to do? What to do!? God, please tell me what to do!? 
I thought it was a better choice to kill her than let her go through all that hell!
.
2. What to do? What to do!? 
.
I cannot kill another one! Not for the same thing! Not for the same... thing...
What to do? What to do!? The candles I’ve been lighting for her are not enough! 
What to do? What should I do when all the prayers and curses are not there to help me through? 
Please, don’t make me kill once more! 
I cannot let them all go free
and let them killed like that!? 
 .
What ... should... I... do.../\
.
?
Now.
.
He sits and cries and prays and yells at God and at himself: 
“Why couldn’t I be braver? why?” 
-I dream about the day when this will end! This stupid, stupid war!...
the one that’s not for them the ones taking it all,
taking advantage and letting us get killed or kill each other, day by day.
I HATE them! HATE them all! ... cold blooded evil acting and deceiving murderers! 
Great cowards not daring to get here and spit
(their own personal)
guts and blood,
*plus drive and thirst*
the ones they make us mark with tears,
our
territories.
*
“I’ll join your group! I will do anything!
-I want us to get done with this cruel slaughtering of our people!...
Yes, Yes! They are! They were, they are all our people!
All this is just a pretext for something that is called
the thirst for the sweetest taste of blood: the one that gets all mixed with something else
 and mixed-up-down to travel... messed-up life! 
That’s what we’ve got!”
.
“Give me the power, give me the strength to get up and fight for myself and my kid!
Please, Lord, I know that my mistakes were real, 
I want to know about redemption, I want to know about how it feels to be loved for real”,
he spoke, 
to be respected and cared for, 
to be able to feel at peace with the work I work for, In the nave of your garden:
- Out! Out! Out! Out of my garden you awful traitor! Out!
The serpent, upset with his god and himself, left the place to be venimous and respected somewhere else. 
 *
- You never really loved me!
- Now how did you know? 
- You never cared enough to find the better way to help me through! 
- Perhaps I wasn’t true to you, Mylady!
The queen, upset and tired with her sneak-peeck interfered:
- He has his job and you have yours! What went wrong? Please, find another way, the better way of rescuing everyone from their own troubles, dear child! 
- I will not, mother! I will learn how to live carefree and carefully! 
- You will not ruin this kingdom! 
- I won’t! I’ll simply do what is best for myself and whatever I can ... for you! 
(I will never forget what you did for me)
*
What was meant as cold fun became painful and awful - some-times to take! 
A joke, perhaps misplaced and nothing works the same
as they used to. 
A joke and its seriousness
standing up for a fight.
A joke that was more of its seriousness 
than seriousness itself was.

3. Beloved traitor-ship
..
~ the titles of the hypocrite ~
.
“Learning about envy and the importance of it,
Knowing that this is just a waste of time, accepting this feeling into my heart, not. 
I’d rather go crazy for learning  and work, for music and hope;
I’d rather be at peace with the entire world.”
Sweet interpretation of the ways I fight,
The ways that I use,
The ways that I made you all cry
..
for nothing, something good,
something beautiful,
something sweet.

-Knock, knock! 
-Who’s there?
-Are you there, contributor to our Saviour?

Journal wreck
“Those like me should be killed. We don’t have the guts to do the right thing for us, for ourselves! a friend said so - and what a friend! she managed to create an entire group of friends supporting her; does she know, did she remember the ancient Greeks this well? Yes, the too weak but very gifted, alone and helped to go through an interesting life under their watch or the ones willing to have some fun watching a loser struggle (or the struggle of someone who was not supposed to become a loser but... humm... fate... hummm.. family... humm... trust, love, respect... hummm... where is that wonderful gift? where did it fly... that trust and belief making me so deaf and blind!!?), they should be killed. We didn’t know how to keep on being strong and beautiful forever! And if we did, the power of the many always offers enough material for one to think deeper and deeper and get to a profound conclusion, not the stupid conclusion that “I got cursed (‘,baby’ or not)”, “I should do something about it (but doing it seems to get me nowhere)”, “Keep your hopes up (Okay, I’m going to ... keep them up! ... - above my head, safely, not in my throat or in my heart - I always hated the smell and taste of blood; now I remember why - it is horrible to have a bleeding heart, a bleeding life... I never liked the heavy smell and taste of blood.) and, of course, not to forget about “There’s no excuse for the way I’m behaving! It is now or never! I will never give-up! Rise, woman, rise! Be a man! (A tear drop and a smile - but shush!) I just have to move on! (oh, the plenitude coming with all that! I just had to think about it twice! Going for it!? Well... what about the right time?! The proper time for something to be properly lived? - with the proper spirit! The proper mind and soul!? The proper tools and training! The proper set of perspectives, goals, courage and attitudes, feelings too be used, why not? for the flavours that taste nothing like blood but contain the necessary stamina. Oh, yes, and the shield, the shields actually, the knives and swords and weapons, the knowledge and the brilliance, the understanding and the cures; all the cures to use when you need to and all the poisons too. Lovely character,  effortless tries and many wishes to make so they can come true forever for those who weren’t denied their own existence, their own achievements and their own selves being accused of bringing everything on themselves! (It was your fault! Your fault, only!- Bleach! a child sickened with this ‘damsel in distress’ feeling would react.)Lovely people, extraordinary characters, those of the ones thinking or believing that they know everything but what they need to know for themselves is to get what(ever) they want -properly done.” 
...
“I am going to be dead soon. Someone was strong enough and against me to put me through the ugliest test ever known in the world of peaceful times, a peaceful war led with words that sometimes feel like curses but are actual blessings while other times they simply are the truth they’re spelling. 
I am going to be dead soon and I hoped to have achieved something for my family that I eventually disappointed heavily. At least that... : at least that... Something for them to be useful and nice, helpful and kind. I am so sorry, my child! I am just a human... ‘was just a human when I decided to fight this way. Not sure which way is better now; not sure what to do for myself but I do know what you should do: don’t care too much about someone who doesn’t deserve you; just care enough not to get yourself into the greatest trouble and live your life the way you want, the way you were taught by your good parents. And please, don’t let yourself caught by surprise and put down by something that is completely wrong and accurate. Sometimes it is good to break a few rules and ‘laws’ of a society that doesn’t feel nor appear to be a healthy going for wealth one - but be careful about it and be smarter and brighter than your mom and dad: take their knowledge and make something of it with both eyes open wide and with the strongest spirit leading, your heart holding the map and guiding you brightly.”

Patience
- I hope this helps - 
_I hope this will be useful to you in your times of need_

But Patience is what you’ll come back soon to,
getting where you’re supposed to
get
all you need and want!
Get back your self-respect.

Call this my venom, call it the way you want
But just go out there and learn how to have some fun 
when nothing seems funny anymore;
when everything has been taken away from you
and you don’t exist anymore
for anyone that might have helped you be or become
- what? Happy? didn’t you live enough of that? - 
come on!
A dog was upset with me and myself upset with whatever I turned into
-not nice enough, not funny,
not brilliant enough for a homey? 
I should have known much better. You do go on and know much better than I did! 
*
With what I do here and now, 
With what I need to do, without knowing why, 
you’ll carry yourselves to the stars,
some of you getting to be ones;
There’s certainty that I’m catching, 
as fun and painful too: some people make it and some people break it;
remember: to be loved for who you are and what you do
IS the Key!
*
-Why is that I keep things going on this time,
this way?
why everything that I know is that I have to make a change?
and this change 
keeps keeping me down,
hauntingly
upset I am, without feeling,
in love with what I knew that felt great, without loving...
since love meant at a certain moment in time leaving;
provoking the pain that I wasn’t sure was safe 
for me or him or her 
to break the ugly unfair rules
(who gave us the right to think and judge? for our futures? For our own lives?) 
*
- I cannot trust them all to make things right - she bothered declaring.
I do not trust your world enough
So I can mind my own businesses and nothing but that;
this is my business too, I happen to have learned
by matters of heart. 
Forgive me!
Please, forgive a poor fool! 
Forgive my audacity! 
Forgive the ways I feel!
* 
Something awesome, something good, 
something generous, something amazing,
sour and cruel killer
(the sweetest heart hardened with cinnamon and flowers) 
something kind
for someone less fortunate 
but true. 
Something exquisite for someone who deserves a better truth.

“She will be the rock you deserve on your chests!”

“She will be your passions! She will be your fears! She will be your god!”

You made her this way!

Out of my personal time 
.
Above, clouds change faces and significance, 
our eyes sometimes watching can see the importance
of the difference they make, 
the inspiration to take and use, learn from, 
take time to meditate upon. 
-We know you, we always did! 
- We loved you and left you - behind, we thought, 
just the ways you did! 
- We are your work, 
the work made in silence, the work made with God. 
.
- It is us, the work of the Lord, the one above ‘em all!
we’re floating, reminding you of who you were, of who you are
and what you did for us; to us,
when only necessary a grasp! 
- We do not think, who thinks they know just better! 
We do not analyse what they believe to be:
the real path to follow!
* 
It is us the ones who are showing who and what you are,
~ the clouds ~
what you did so far and why! 
We are the work of the high, 
the darkness in the depths of those divine
new hopes emerged from
the light we’ve been carrying on with, transforming, 
our legacy 
shared for more
than what they were willing to believe in. 
*
- What was it? You needed a child to sacrifice, didn’t you?
- Don’t bother for me anymore, he spelled rarely, as if the words got read-out from the air he was staring at.
*
- You will never see me if you think that I was trying to hurt her!
I did! 
- You will never see me if you believe that I wanted to save her too! 
I did!

Salamander Hopes 
.
It crossed my way, she changed, hiding away 
from the firm steps 
of a loser;
There was a time, some time ago
when in between four eyes and two heads we spoke
and I said: No! 
I do not want to be your toy, trapped 
in a decent way of paying
for who I am: 
A skin resource, a hunter and a player.
A yellow-greened, at times upset to red;
the funny thing, 
the interesting exhibit,
Your salamander. 
.
Then life came by and showed me more
about the salamander I could have become
if not this stubborn. 
- Oh, yes! I said, with wit and wisdom in my heart,
my eyes, the brains erect: 
- They must be happy not having to work for their food! 
*
The hopes, Ah, yes! The hopes of high and great new altitudes! 
The hopes I had
to become the food for a greater family member, the snake! 
Now I wish to get back again, 
to that state of presence, 
existence and life
worth living,
.
- they call themselves friends and good neighbours, they are around here -
.
entitled with the dignity of the human. 
The hopes! Ah, the hopes!
The wishes to be more than a human 
are the very problem;
they made me get where I am now!
They turned me into this colourful thing that I am,
a peculiar reptile among her kind,
The Strange Salamander. 
.
Sometimes odd, other times unique,
peculiar a thing,
always the way I want to be,
the one and only, 
one of a kind,
The changing colours,
Luckiest one! 
“We’ve never met another one like this one!”,
the only specimen, 
extraordinary thing, 
The Funny Salamander.
*
It crossed my way, she changed, hiding away 
from the firm steps 
of a loser;
- Another loser of the game, oh well! I said.
She’s just a human, someone who needed to understand 
that it was over. 
I got to understand it too, I am now a lizard. 
They, maybe, love studying me, 
I might be getting strong applause!
But 
...
I felt trapped,
 when in a glass of  memories and creativity all shrunk to the size 
they believed
“It’s just as much as she needs”
“Besides, this way she’ll be much safer!”
- Well, yes! Agreed, I did feel safer.
But God, I loved it when I was remembered how it used to be when
allowed
to be wild, thinking myself free (to live) again,
knowing how to
...
A tag now speaks about my life
in parts of life:
Descending gracefully from the black to the white,
another combination of particles
covering for the colours of
my life.
 .
on different grounds,
variety in scenery 
and the proper food, all the fresh feelings - 
I’ll admit: I deserved it!
Don’t care about the proper mark or sign - too many signs, 
too different.
I’ll admit that I accepted it. 
  .
I hunt, what’s wrong with that? I am an animal, my friend!
I am a hunter and a friend of nature! 
I am 
The Salamander. 
..
.
S_He acts like an eagle but why isn’t she a super-star, my neighbour?
.
Angry and powered by anything that’d help:
right now, me hating your guts would be of that best help much needed. 
But I can’t slice you down so, these words will; 
one day you’ll pay for what you did to me...
Humm...-Friend! 
.
- Why can’t I go on with this thing? How did you do this? 
You kept enlightening me, us,
and now we feel that all this doesn’t matter to anybody else!
to anyone at all, I cannot see how I’ll get no frustration going on.
(at least we’ll keep on talking about the chemistry-roles!)
Perhaps I should have found another reason for us to spend more time out there
just doing what I care for: We?
MySelf now watching from above: “that’s such a lovely reason!” 
Am I just  one, just anyone? 
Right now, I am. 
The perfect end, for the great days-decision. 
.
Tomorrow I will be your friend, 
the day after tomorrow ‘will be the doomed to end 
a novel:
Now, why couldn’t I beat that unicorn fulfilling nightmares in those movies!? 
“Don’t mess with her! Don’t mess with me!”
I didn’t! 
How did that help?
Who messed with whom?
Perhaps confusion really meant something! 
.
Am I a nobody in a crowd? I am! I’m moving, working, hoping, living, doing something, people!
You’re callin’ all this: Living!
It is but it might mean also postponing
The new life prepared for you
.
...
To
Too
...
much
Too

Only the witch knows
(but the witch knows nothing)
..

Don’t tell me how I feel, the way you feel! 
Reproaches, unrealistic, becoming a real-deal.
(if you want it, only if you want this too!) 
Don’t tell me how to feel!
to love or not that YOU, this ME, the US!
Don’t tell me how to act
IN OUR ACTS!
-Please, do tell me who I am, in your eyes!-
-Wanna know your paths!-
Creators of a killing machine you are! 
It will be your responsibility, 
anything might happen from now on! 
(on your shoulders to carry what you did to us! since for us wasn’t too good to be true!)
They had to go on and try to murder you... for nothing... just what you received!
_did they believe that they’ll get more out of what they never meant to offer?_
The old laws, old as you will fall upon you, you..., you and only you! 
Creators of pathetic and pathetic losers!
Destroyers of ideals: creating what you are - now you’re ideals, wonderful, to be destroyed, destroyed!
Recomposed matter of the world you loved!
.
I hurt some feelings, can I hope for less than I got in return?
.
My life events weren’t so awful as it speaks, the entire irony too fake for me to bother for
 more than I still do; 
the flowers of violets, roses and princesses named Tiger-Nanny, 
Some delicate nymphs and a flower of hope, a star among the great, 
The Queen of the Night, 
behaving like nobody else. 
.
“I am everything I want to know, I’m everything I fought before and what I’m fighting for now,
In a certain amount of peculiar feel,
I am what I am, 
what you are.”
Looking to find places where to rest my troubled soul, for a while, my hurt mothers’ heart, 
my hurt pride, my tired and upset mind
-upset with what went wrong-
petulant insatiable sips of fresh air
my heart feeds with
during the storm. 
* 
The only thing that I’m going to take away from you is your life!
extraordinary mocking bird! 
Why did you have to mock the work of a poor devil, trying to follow the path described as the saint one!?
an example given to everyone to follow
_But only for their prides to get dressed-up with the greatest of glories_
Only with their prides made the queens of all shows! 
Only if proud, too proud for what you are,
for what you were!
*
-Where is the sunflower? 
Where are my trees? 
Where can I find some poppy-flowers and cherry-trees? 
Why does the man of a drinker I was
trying to save someone else from doing things wrong, 
haunting someone? 
I lost only to gain something in return; 
perhaps through the pain that I felt wasn’t well deserved. 
Musae coming here, 
they’re carrying the remnants of a soul, 
and music is my soul, the melody covered by a Stonehenge cover,
the one I always felt
it was meant to last forever. 
.
- I lost him! 
- I don’t care! I didn’t struggle so I get here for nothing!
- I lost him! What was I supposed to do? 
- I keep wishing to remember
and care some more. 
.
-How could I sleep for such a long time?
What did my soul do now? she asked!? 
- Oh, poor child, never ask too much of these questions; 
Remember only that every love story includes at least a moment painful.
.
Life events
..
Once upon a time... 
All these stories... all these fantastic dreams lived by amazing characters, 
the ones we need to hear about from time to time, 
it’s getting boring, it’s getting too hysterical, theatrical and fun... 
For whom, I ask? For whom? 
Not all of us can be that cruel! 
For whom? 
.
“Once upon a time... and the time was just about right in time for another visit paid to the lady of love blue, 
a paradise united for a room
where angels took their chances 
with a reason.”
.
In the sea of artists and creators all this means more than a set of accessories to refurbish the worlds we gather in one. In the sea of artists we are, as we get to choose, just another accessory reinventing itself  over and over again, until dust will speak about each and every one of us, showing what we were actually made  of.
..
“For I remember what happened and what you meant offering to me;
One time for being grateful, another one to be upset with - what went wrong?
I’m sorry if I hurt you: an object is an object for love to help around and hatred to kill the fun.
~ You are a human, good and kind! ~
*I have nothing against the human that you are! *
And this is no exception.
**
*
My hatred kills what’s wrong.”
*
He will love you forever, 
you will love him back! 
Let your heart heal and have the time of the needed repair. 
 ~
I’m talking easy ways, you’ll say; I’m saying it to myself again! now, take it as you need it!
-Get up on your feet, don’t just stand there! He wouldn’t like to see you this heart-broken!
-Be stronger!
~
 *
Hard it feels to be asked to choose between the people and things that you love, 
I know, ... I felt like this before, ... I know, I have been there before. But I know nothing.
I need a break from this state of mind, miserable.
.
“I want my share of guilt, thank you!”  s_he said. 
.
Out of sinners: now, your choice 
..
I made a life choice now what’s there to do
about it
than be punished again and again 
for doing what’s right among the living. 
.
Expected to kill someone who hurt me very bad,
Oh, never! I will always avoid getting that injured; 
Now how about a suicidal mission?
.
No way, I’ve learned my lessons a long time ago! 
This time I’ll just know the right place for anyone like me or her! 
I did it again, perhaps loved you much more than I should have! 
I’ll learn how to love less or perhaps even more, 
(who can tell? -  about the power preserved in there?) 
just enough so nobody got too hurt around here, 
the place and places where I seem to belong to, 
wherever I’d dwell. 
.
I’m tired of remembering the world, too small, I’ve visited some places,
I’m tired of being insecure and most wonderful; 
too tired of being sick, I’m sick of this disgusting interpreting! 
I wanted out for the revenge that I believed in! 
I wanted out for the new fresh beginning,
the exploration of a world of “the new” to which I seemed to have 
participated. 
_do I know what I’m talking about, though?- 
.
- A forced participation, does it count, should it count? 
Why do we keep counting the moments until
Some miracle happened?
How can we be that stupid? 
- Go on!
- How can we wish for and ask for much more of this?
.
- My highest hopeful dreams were beautiful! 
My aspirations, pale.
 right now it feels like echoing in time
since pride is taking everything away from those who really care! 
How could I not be disappointed with myself!? 
and why (shouldn’t I?)
How could I not be disappointed with the world I got to work for? 
mine.alone.trapped.in a lie
(ThaT’s BEutiFul.L)
.
So, yes! You will never forget me for this! You will see me and my face,
you will feel, you will learn, you will take notice again 
the fact that you wanted much more doesn’t bother her: 
only the actions of a real rescuer
of the heart.
Does a rescuer 
?
...
does he
...
anything 
for what he wants? 
.
Why can’t I love her? Why? 
.
Look above, see why! Your choices, that’s why! 
My choices were too
Hilariously true
...
sometimes! 
.
  I missed being a traitor, now what can I say!? 
We all have to do something wrong
for equality, equity?
Am I lost in the space of the totality of the word-meaning?
(or was it the meaning of the word that puzzled me or him?)
Hopefully not! 
Help us, my lord, my god! 
Help me help myself!
.
We can always bother to play 
a ridiculous way 
out of great trouble. 
The ways of a coward. 
The human race will never be more grateful! 
For this!
*
- Wasn’t I selfish thinking myself important for the job? 
- Selfishness is something you’ll need in order to run
your heart, your mind, that self of yours towards
an end of a story,
the beginning of a new road.
.
- I can be very hurtful, she told him one day. 
- I can be the same way! Everyone can!
This story can go on, 
it happens all the time, 
as humans tend to gather memories
in pockets, square and round,
in purses, in their minds...
on the roads of life remembered
just the ways you are.
The ways we are! 
* 
God, help me change this life of hell inside my mind! 
Help changing this into something beautiful instead... somehow! 
.
-But I don’t want to be blind, do not make me go blind! 
Help me be lucid so I did the right thing... (wrong) 
a work of art which isn’t meant to be easily done;
not easy as before! 
I was so sure that I wasn’t doing anything that wrong! 
For all the damage I provoked I pay in tears now, honey! Sweet-heart that’s melting in the pot... 
as the cubes they crush between their teeth
all crumble and turn into the potion 
changing the taste of all horrors produced. 
.
Rage! Rage against what can be used for us to dance beautifully!
The grace of Love for God! 
Perhaps, the other way around! 
And there goes time with different versions of the same old stories! 
Angels and demons
spoken about
living and fighting
for the same holy or not (yet) 
grounds. 
.
A proof of the lack of imagination we got forced to make our bursting rebellion shine. 
*
   I missed being a traitor, now what can I say!?

`to where it feels like home`
^
Come, my sweetest child! There is your book! 
On that table, round, you’ll see a pen and some paper 
waiting to be transformed into your work. 
- Go grab that pen and paper and the book! 
The desk I promised to have prepared for you
is waiting in The Room,
the magic room you once spoke openly about: 
“It feels like an eternal place where one can learn and create forever!”
- It is, my lovely child! It is! 
- It feels like home! 
*
Dear mother... 
this place is home to me!

That evening falling found them close
together.

“One day you will get your brand new computer. Right now you study!”

One Star sending messages,
out of the winds, a movement makes its shimmering shine
upon its glorious times,
down on the glasses of the windows
impressed and ready to be blessed and bless those children of time;
times for miracles extracted from experiences of beauty to rise
our spirits in spiritual perceptions 
of what’s become just one 
with all the burned decisions of their lives, 
our lives, 
our surfaces are now
 reflections of the kind
... 
of pearled screen-saving rainbow-particles;
enchant! 
Enchant the chanting tilts, 
the gamblers’ safe mode guilty gilts: - What did I do to deserve this? 
A window and a panel frame,
once broken in romantic flames,
they dream together on waves of precision, 
examining the reason of their flaws, 
exploring the labyrinths of their possible fresh starts and new homes. 
*
There, at the entrance of the hall, a fancy staircase showing off
her shy angelic beauty: 
- You are a foxy little shrew, come on, acknowledge... 
Let’s not get all too dressed-up for this night, shall we? 
.
The spirit’s high saying hello, goodbye, 
hello, goodbye
and in between salutes
the shows that must complete the world of tragedies and poems. 
.
They didn’t have the reasons to take me to the shore; 
I had to practice a little more: 
- I’m gonna practice and practice some more, until I learned this all by instinct, by heart
and sharpen this feeble sight of mine - too tired to see more of your beauty. 
*
-What’s this?
- You cannot break this! It will be forever, 
Our angels still believe in you and I, 
You and me, can still work it out together, 
please, don’t be afraid of us, of me. 
.
“Some just can’t live the way I did; 
it isn’t as if their ways were much better or worse! 
many were just the right people, 
entitled to live normal lives.”
Let them live, let them live, now!
.
Great times spoiled by your mocking birds -feed them cuties! 
they don’t know a thing!
the responsibility is all yours!
make them play around for their innocence to shine 
in your soul!
*
I trust you, I know that you will do the right thing, my child! 
Take care! Take care of yourself now!
Be always wonderful, 
always aware and at peace,
Strong.

To watch their monitoring shows 
as one is at their desk

- I don’t believe the times we’re living now! 
- And I... I never knew how much I needed to raise a child.
-Enjoy a time like this! 
I always saw myself a child enough to struggle on my own; 
-Now I can see, believe and act as if too beautiful
a woman to be true!

I’ll never be more able to say ‘Thank You’ for this gift
than now and every moment spent from now on
for bringing you-up where you belong to! 
For helping you help when down their among all those who help and need help.

She never was called mother, never loved as one before,
as she never had a child of her own to teach and take good care of;
she never felt more close to a child before. 
..
-I’m tired.
I would love some tea that wouldn’t make me feel as if I did something too wrong
to enjoy the time spent here. 
-This guilt of being happy! Illuminating. 
- We need a doctor, those like me, you know it!
.
-These people! I sometimes wish them all to rot in hell! 
I sometimes wish they felt the ways I felt 
- ...so they stopped judging? 
-I do not know, perhaps...
perhaps I just want them all out
feeling cold, craving for the good old hug, 
the kind old warmth 
of that human heart I always claimed to have had; 
...
why didn’t I choose to hide it better?

- This book is odd, too odd for me! 
What do you think she’s trying to say, the author? 
-With the entirety of the book? I do not know! 
But I can allow myself the luxury of interpreting it as a personal world
reflected upon the world outside
that’s been influencing her for a while,
teaching her greater and greater things
about the greatest of things and fancies. 
Universal matters of living 
‘la vida loca’. 
- You’re funny! There’s nothing crazy about this book
but the covers which are made of ‘personal gold, so to speak’  and with very expensive 
materials and tools! those look a little crazy-good, 
sometimes cozy
in a crazy way of seeing things, probably. 
(the kids stop and watch her closely; three scrutinizing painful looks enough to make her think about it)
... I’m guessing. (she smiles)
- Aren’t you interested in the hands that made it? 
- You can tell me? 
- They are written on the covers’ inner side
with magic invisible paint. Look! 
.
- I wonder how they made that ink! 
- One day I’ll surrender and show you something that was supposed to be kept as a secret.
- What!?

the owl outside on the tree near the window 
made herself heard. 
They both startled.
- That’s odd! She never speaks a sound, our outside guardian wise!
It would be better if we focused on the security of the house. 
Go check the northern and the west sides! 
I’ll check the other ones, my dear! 
Go find them all, the doors and windows to be well locked and let the second raven out! 
He’ll know what to do. 
*
- Two ladies, all alone! 
What did you expect? Not to be kind and gentle enough but wise and clever,
knowing how to take the right measures to help and protect themselves?
The armies of rodents got amazed and confused
learning that it was time for them to drop their spying on the girls
while eating their crops and vegetables in the yard. 
- The rave-eens!
Too late! The owls solved the case
by taking all the rest of them by surprise. 
- You guys are great, the ravens spoke! How many did you eat? 
- Only about fifty four, both. 
- Ah! Then we shall call this one even; 
we managed to have a pretty decent supper, 
this evening too. 
- Mysterious as always, these ravens!
- Mysterious indeed, my sister!  But a brother spoke too wisely once more
and told me that we’re awfully much more of a mystery to them
than they will ever be prepared to acknowledge!

Now, what do you want from me!?

drawing themselves,
 watching the surroundings with the prides of the ones knowing they’re helpful.
- What did you do for your community of ravens, Chica?
- I was never there, never there with them for them! 
I was never there, trying to be helpful! 
I was never there! 
- Silent Ravens, knowing who you are!
Knowing what you did for another one
to fall into the arms of the helpful lord of dances,
 for the unicorns you all admire on the screens and cups showing 
amazing on television
but too great for you in theaters, on streets...
all fighters need their times of rest,
their times of peace! 
.
All fighters up for more! They never wanted you to go there, where...! 
All theaters and shows need the spectacular! 
Depressed!? I’m sorry! That’s that! We need the most wonderful and varied pieces of fact
that don’t feel!
but act
A cold blooded machine, that’s what we all need around here! 
.
_I love my blood when rich and hot!_ 
Oh,
Chica, what did you do? Why couldn’t you handle too much to take? 
(for anyone as a matter of fact)
How come you weren’t that great!? 
Why weren’t you the most beautiful?
the most talented? The best?
Didn’t all their magic find a better rest in those truly loved?
For those who were lucky enough?
.
Chica, what happened!? Who was the great!? The smartest and brightest of all!? 
.
Surely not you since you slept without sleeping, 
you laughed without laughing 
at people.

You’re probably the one who’s learned all her lessons all too soon. 
We will never bother for someone like you anymore!

We do have the perfect machines to handle things better than you,

-The elephants have no chance, they say. Black birds with an interesting grip and a wonderful cheer,
mysterious humour, mysterious beaks,

but the Giraffe, that one knows more than she’s shown

HELP!

..
...
A most lovely love story: beginnings
..
I’m sure you’ll make the rest of it happen the ways you want 
so, why should I give you the entire story in this present now? 
Let us just wait and see
what is that life will bring, 
what is that will happen to all those feelings and humans, their peoples able of having and using a feeling. 
(most properly hoped for! most lovely a proper thought!) 
..
  It starts with a rumour, my story, and the rumour is quite discreet, occasionally bringing-up a demon or something alike to the awareness of the entire thing with a title. Noble. It’s nothing special, really! Only two lost souls that happened to find one another and recognise themselves as belonging to the same space, coming from the same outer-space burst of illusions.  They are sailing right now, around the world. Who knows which cruise they missed and which director’s media-publisher-heart got deeply hurt for not making (up?) a story for their perfect romance? They preferred it this way, their honey-Unearthly-moon of a time spent idealizing the idea of love. 
This is how the acid-lover inside me would describe the whole thing if we were talking about  a famous couple. But, since we’re actually speaking about two characters in a book that hasn’t been written by me yet, things appear to be normal and kindly protected from the follow of a storm-like splash of flaming and water-fall words which would show themselves capable of creating the perfect vapours for the trees in the rain-forests where they might just head on to and explore the strange lives of some friendly tribes. 
.
 - This is very pleasant a place... the sea, us sleeping for a change... I love this! ... I love you!
- What if I put a spell on you, darling! What then!? Would you keep loving me the same!? 
She bursts into a lovely bell-like laughter. 
- Of course, I would! I’d love you even more! 
- Is that so!? Knowing that I took you away from  the freedom of knowing the most perfect Charming!? 
Her laughter, coming from granted depths, became viral and he felt immediately infected by it. 
- No charming as good as a good charm... She takes a break and thinks about it, mildly, her mind away in distant times, the air brought back, a bitter trace of sadness coming to meet the light of her eyes, getting killed by the stubbornness of a sun that’s got all playful at this hour. I would love you more..., she went on confessing, because I’d love you just the same as I love you now.
- You mean, progressively wrong? 
- Ha, ha!... (they chuckle shortly) 
- Exactly! It doesn’t matter, really... if one is truly happy... and I am! So, whatever the charming magic potion you placed in my drink that night, the greatest! I’ll have to find myself a good provider of such things so I kept you forever in my claws! 
From the depths of his heart-cells, spreading to all the little cells in the body, a happy laughter was manifested with surprisingly discreet honours. This perfect dagger brought her smile on her face illuminating it so brightly that the sun got a little embarrassed and took away some of its brilliance spears that were cast upon her lovely face, letting her shine more as herself for the few priceless seconds before her slumber into a most pleasant floating dream.

- Wake-up! Wake-up!
Mom! Wake-up! There’s fire in the house! 
.
- What!... she tries to put herself together quickly looking for the towel to soak in the water-pool.  - What happened! Where’s Charleen!? 
- She’s in the house! Come! Quickly! 
.*.
A few hours later the three women stay out the building, half burned, half-stable enough, just like in a pictured commercial showing a before and after effect, having ice-cream and wine and laughing at the entire scandal brought upon the place. 
- We’re cursed! 
- Yep! 
- It’s all your fault, Chay! You brought this upon us! You and your infamous recipes for candid candle-work. 
- They’re not candid! Mom! 
- You’re no longer kids! Stop acting like ones! You are mature enough not to act like this! so please! 
- Serious as always! 
- You should come to my plays! You’d feel a lot more amused. We’re working on some comedy show now! That would loose you-up a little. 
- Sure, why not! Will they show me how to magically turn our necessities into ‘no problems’ at all? 
- Sure! You just have to be open minded! 
.
A good laugh and everything’s gone... except for the damages done that need to be repaired; then come the mortgages, the rents, the insurances... they are something that seems to be eternal. How could I not empathize with my serious character now and ask for those to burn and transform into ‘no problems, no worries at all?’! Only funny, interesting, hilarious... pathetic (getting there would mean I’m too rich to even know that the word ‘poverty’ exists! - oh, wait a minute! I just remembered: there was something in a dictionary, old stuff... I don’t know the occasion but I opened the thing and there it was, the word!) and other things that might just come in hand and help us breathe!

“Leading a life in perfect solitude offered her the chance to clear her mind and speak from the heart more often, without misjudging anyone, hurting only where things needed to get hurtful; things, not hearts... things that aren’t ill enough because hearts don’t need to be corrected. Hearts always know! 
- All of them? the child asked.”

My Angel is crying for us and I cry when not armed to teeth with all the weapons and covered by the protective bullet-proof waist-coats and suits.

What have we done?

You almost died because of her, 
she’s been avoiding getting cursed in any way, 
she’s been protecting her own shell
as if nothing else would count into the whole wide world!

Correcting the grounds

We never get to be too happy, 
well, never come-by, now! 
We’re never satisfied with the result!
But never came back any-how! 
We never take as much as we deserve, 
we’re either on one edge but counting on another
while dreaming of going further away,
spreading our wings and fly through
in time 
- forget about the space, forget about our grace, right now -
Just turned away from dangers, music’s speaking out loud;
the real one, not what I’ve been hiding from your lies. 
.
Forget about the space and concentrate 
on your pathetic bodily existent creature tent
in which the beauty of one teardrop which was true
has coiled inside one thought helping out what makes this good
feel good, as quality and love songs make amends.

Not going to bother about her anymore. 
Joy! Such a beautiful name! Joy! 
Why won’t you be my angel and save me from this rats-hole!

No!

Pauline 
.
A letter written in the silence of a meditative state of mind,
she watches the birds dancing the other way around.
She doesn’t feel that she belongs to her people anymore;
she never did, she never cared
she preferred to be herself, alone. 

Is is better to be someone else, a wreck among your people,
a saint deceived and sad, pretending that everything’s okay.
-...whatever might have happened,
- if...?
- no matter what you’ve done?
*
A letter written in the silence of 	
God, who wanted what they didn’t want
for her; 
a letter written for a strange new ‘Adieu’.
*
Pauline, my dear, your letters have been filling the gaps of timeless times now;
endless moments when nothing else but pain and suffering
was waiting for my end of a tunnel,
each and every day. 
I learned some, all by heart,
just like a poem or the lyrics of a song. 
I made myself so useful and extremely wrong
in front of  each and every comrade. 
.
I’ve spoken silenced-words to you, 
to them a thousand more, 
I loved each poem and each word you kindly recommended 
so, I’d better show that to the world. 
.
One heaven, we were taught we’ll fight for, 
one cruel, pathetic world
where everything will be just normal,
and no more blood. 
Now, I am here and thinking, 
again, again, once more, 
that all this wasn’t meant for one fat lie of a world; 
it was for them, I’m being used but I accepted thinking of our children
instead of trying, hoping for, doing just nothing.
.
“Aren’t we all disappointed, feeling deceived, now, dear?
Aren’t we wrong doing the killing 
of someone else’ home instead?”
.
-Is it, was it for our homes? indeed, my inner home feels broken.
Where are you now, my dear Pauline, 
to comfort my old days of shameless pride
taken on having
what these poor people never dreamed of
since they know 
they have to do the work of hardening the grounds
for their lost neighbours:
The Noble. 
*
Noble comprehension, fine sharp indicators,
full stop
searching for a punctuation mark

breakfast’s dull,
a must. 
We all need to relax sometimes.
*
Oh, the noble led us all to where we are, 
and I am feeling down, my heart all crushed in shame!
Oh, where! Oh where are you, my dear Pauline, 
to tell me more about how I’ll succeed 
in bringing peace to our freedom,
encouraging.

StormSon
.
A hero, he was, he’s gentle and kind, 
Today, at the funeral of the greatest heart of all: 
 - Couldn’t you resurrect her? 
- I wish I could... how could I if not even Cerebro
could?
.
- I’ll miss her, my Storm, I know that she wasn’t the real one,
still I’ll miss her. 
- The real one was gone for too long a time;
we needed this one to help our team 
defeat Gansthub.
.
- He’s dangerous a thing, Hrumbga! Look what he did there!
Him alone! 
- They really got a strong one on their side! 
- And now that this Storm’s gone... 
.
- The other one returned! 
.
- Look! it’s the real one! The real one in the sky!
A breeze caressed the face of a lovely child
offering to her the sweetest lullaby. 
- Go rest! You worked too hard for your exams! 
- But I don’t want to! I want to see the battle! 
I want to play this game! 
I am only a child! Please, let me understand
what is my duty now!?
Please, help me understand?
.
- Today!? Oh, dear! You’re such a darling! 
There will be no battle, now! Even the heroes need to sleep sometimes 
for their forces to gather
back stormed for something more,
the right time, 
the moment when asked for
the help they need. 
.
- I so much want to be like you! ... one day... this feeling will be true! 
- Be lucky as you are, my dear! 
Belonging to this team is dangerous and cruel! 
Belonging here means more than just one teardrop for you to be brave! 
It means to be doomed, 
it means to be broken and always on your own. 
It means to suffer badly enough for you to press ignore 
to any pain, to all potential suffering,
to anything related to the humane and human soul. 
It means to be much stronger and more cruel than you really are..., than you’d want to accept and deal with;
to confront with all the dangers and be able to smile again,
when there’s nothing to admire but the wrecks 
provoked 
by your wonderful fake heroes. 
- But you’re a team! You have a team! 
(Be willing to do your best and try to be the hero in which they can believe!) 
- We do understand that we’re lucky too, now, 
having a place to call our home; 
knowing that we do belong somewhere. 
Still, when the lights are off, after a battle that’s always hard to take,
depending on how many
involved, 
we’re each and every one of us alone
with our own problems and troubles to apply the cures to or embrace;
We’re helped only when we can’t handle things anymore. 
It can be cruel, it can be fun but very hurtful, dearest child! 
Remain a human for as long as you can!
.
- It will be helpful! It will be used well!
- Thank you! 
- Please, do remember, Cerebro is not a wonder toy
to serve 
your personal interests, only. 
You must learn how to be of help, 
put your knowledge and forces 
to the service of the community and our purposes
for that fantastic
beautiful dream of a world
that we’d like to speak of as ‘new’,
mostly
wonderful.
Something to take one away to the era of generosity and beauty. 
- This new obsession of yours with beauty! Where have I been? 
I managed to forget about your crazy ideals! 
- Don’t make me feel sorry I helped you when in need! 
Don’t make us punish you again
for what you did! 
.
- I won’t, I promise! I’ll be good! I have the very family, you see!? 
The one to support me and make me trustworthy! 
- Make feel that I can trust you. 
- ... that I can really be
part of the entire fanstamagorical
heroes-family!

The Cat and the Fish 
.
Measured spaces through measured paws creating a path through the hall
and out the door in the garden.
The Cat isn’t wonderful today!
The cat is to be feared, 
she is a hunter not a friend to the birds; 
for the first time in a thousand years
the cat began to call to the rise of the dead and sleeping genes
of whom she was before.
All those times, 
forgotten by the streets 
from where her mother came
right into the best of homes. 
.
The Cat had to go back 
.
.to the hunter origins,
learning how to have some fun. 
.
There is a fishbowl in a room, up to the fifth floor of the biggest house 
in all the neighbourhood.
The fishbowl, empty: 
now why is that? 
The cat’s extremely well shaped and sharp an eye she had.
Perceptive as they always are, 
sent all the info
to a brain that was responsive enough to ask for more details:

The cat’s admiring a cage, full of noisy and coloured surprises. 
“Oh, wow! If they weren’t this high and dangerously placed where they are for me!” 
The cat is listening to their singing!
“Oh, wow! If I could just get my paws on one bird!” 
a thousand pigeons and some quiet little herons around,
some eating seeds and crumbs, others only having a sip of water in a forgotten puddle of rain-water
where a group of cheeky ordinary Hirundinidae bathe and play.
.
Couldn’t I feel more damaged by this situation? - Hopefully not! 
- God forbid!

A cellar of celestial proportions he dreams the cellist 
as his cello-strings
pull out a memory to rise melodies in some hearts
that needed to burn more of their remembered times
of beauty, of charm;
enchanted poems and reasons
to enchant the luckiest presents around. 
A keyboardist’s celerity is spoiling some mellow flights: 
Surprise, surprise! 
-They’re all happy to watch his dangerous movements committing the crimes- 
.
- Oh, god! That’s insane! Now what can I say!? How could I ever compete with something like him?
As it seems that competition fell down at some feet
let us just rise a cup of beer, right about up there,
expecting everyone to have the best of their times 
admiring, applauding  and hating the one for his great gift and achievements. 
- They actually love ‘em!
- Yes, they do. 
Alright!
.
- I am only doing what I think that would be right
for a friend in need.
Perhaps I am crazy or a little mad
but pacing myself and meditation will help. 
I’m sure of it!

You won’t put the ugliness of your curse upon me!

Forget about Love, the real trouble here! Love only needed you to bake

Forever in debt to the family 
That doesn’t give-up on holding it tight to action:

don’t you think they kind of crossed the line and that they are abusing your kindness and generosity, 
my Time?
Don’t you think it might just not be your fault that the entire world moved on and along
with a plan
to make you feel and be much less than you really are
“for the sake of humanity”?

carréssant des nuages avec leur verts bougeons
et leur pétales de grace et de parfums. 
Silence.

Voilà, rien n’est perdu
et perdus nous sommes ailleurs, sans tes paroles, désirs, pardons;
 ces choses de bonne chance que nous nous souhaitons l’un l’autre:
Un monde entier trouvé à tes pieds
enveloppé
 dans la totalité des choses éloquentes simplifiées
pour être grands quand on est petits,
tout petits pour vous faire sentir
du vrai!

A Sonofadream

The kiss of Death is what I got for leaving you, 
I was promised something else, 
something beautiful instead.
.
I was looking for a way to support us all
but failed. 
Now I am back on the field, working for it, most certainly like never before. 
Soon I’ll be having the necessary money and then
I’ll be out of here, once more. 
I’ll give it one more try! 
I did! I ran away, for a second time. 
.
I was promised something else after this graduation of mine! 
I was dreaming of something great, of something amazing; 
I really believed that I’d shine
like no other! 
‘A school of fools!’ I was told I graduated, later that year,
when looking for a post-graduation training in a field
that had too little grass to be cut.
(I imagined that other fools got there first - well, what to do? - and chopped it all off!)
. 
Now I’m here; not dealing with the pain of not making it to the very top. 
I failed my parents, I failed my country, I failed the trap itself! 
What’s more out there to spell-out about my own self? 
.
So, here I am! I don’t want you to take me back or even care. 
I am not asking you to pity me, oh, god, please, don’t! do not share with me your problems either. 
The only thing about my sorrowful descent back on earth I wanted you to know about, I already spoke. 
You were right, You were goddamn right being wrong, sending me to hell that night. 
Some nice time to spend now, if you’d like! 
Perhaps we’ll meet as two old friends, some-time, when it’d feel at least okay to -
 having a chat about what’s been going on since I left.
(can you imagine all that?)
 You left for something else too. 
It’s been on the goddam television! 
It happens! You were right! It wasn’t meant to be.  
I lost just like you said it’d be! 
You ... both... 
(she watches the tops of her shoes) 
- Oh, look! I forgot to take care of my boots! I just remembered! 
I have to go back home, now! 
Goodbye! I hope you’ll have a nice time there with all the stars!

“It’s a lovely story the one that I am about to tell, 
about a woman and a man, 
a couple afraid to go to hell, 
too scared to meet with the devil. 
*before bed-time* 
.
A brother and sister, the children playing in the park
and the devil doing his and her job.... 
Instantly the words got gathered to spell a way, 
taking back home as many goods as possible. 
Happiness is my best choice, so I’ll remain inert! 
I am not going to touch that 
infernal burning gift! 
.
They kept taking and taking, 
much more is they all need
But the poor devil was now too afraid
to offer them more than they already had taken away
out of a thirst for a need.

  Kneel! by the forces of God, he’s put to the test, for another round,
asked to give it another try... a second try to the sec.

How can we please you?

“She used to have a lovely house with the loveliest garden, Mrs. Pettygrew. 
-Pettybrew, dear! That would be Pettybrew! 
Yes, right. Petty...brew. A garden where she used to plant flowers and sometimes little ornamental trees and ferns. She used to compete with some of her tulips and ferns at some of the fairs organised all over the state. Sometimes she won big prizes other times only a few dollars to cover for her expenses and troubles taken but she was happy. You could see her joy healthy as a rose blooming on her face. Now the place has turned into an exhibit of bush-art. No more ferns there, and almost no trees at all. Only two or three of the old live-wooden friends were kept. The rest got replaced with little ornamental, mostly  pot-trees that were meant to become a work of frisky-art with some roots to the place that got to be new for them as well as for everyone else around here. Quite a change, Mrs. Pettygrew... 
- ...hrmm...
- ah... Pettybrew’s place. I wonder if she likes what’s become of it!”

Stone-pane stories, with love

1. “- We just had to have a fight. Otherwise it would have been boring a life led around here! How to inspire if you don’t fight!? How to get to be noticed and noticeable, annoying a being to get the successful life we all imagined as “the most wonderful thing on the planet”? How else to be considered as a flavorous part of this existence, flavorous and fun (to be around, I hope). 
- Upsetting a thought as this one might be, a fight is a fight and a game is a game. Then again, this is not a game but our lives with which we do not want to play outside the sets, those studios and screens on which we pretend to be the ways we should be when attacked: real! 
- Huh! That sounds like a great win!
- I’m not sure if this is an irony, a joke or a try to escape the rest of the guests but instead of honey we’ve got some sour-cherries syrupy desert with which our coffee and tea go simply mad and wonderful at the same time so, do please, come and join us into the garden. 
- The garden!? 
- Pardon me, madam, but isn’t it too hot a time of the day to sit in the garden with the mosquitoes? 
- There are no more mosquitoes around here, sir Rupert, they’ve been fried. Instead we have some birds to enchant us with their singing, others to make a little charming noise and a few ones to keep their beaks silent in the honour of these most delightful days spent together here, at the Manor. 
- Of course, ... madame.... 
- Charming little silent birds. I wonder if they can actually sing! 
~ a bird *in his head, perhaps* sang an articulated verse of a poem ~
*We can! Yes, we can!*
(as they carry on with their conversation further away from the rest of the group, two gentlemen follow, noisily gesturing but speaking in settled voices, first one completed by the more civil number-two voice.) 
- It seems to me that everything nowadays is nothing but a job to do.... sometimes well, other times... well... Our children seem to be bored by the lives they’re living. Isn’t it a shame?!
- Most certainly our shame, sir Knowland. 
.
(a few steps away from this couple of friends, another conversation’s letting something out of the group) 
- I am not sure if this is a joke or a simple irony slipped but the requiem you proposed as an introduction to my party....
.
Everything seems to go on as usual; a place where time has stopped cutting ideas locked in the air of a pocket-watch-screen, letting aristocracy win back some times of glorious superiority.”

- Now things are bearable to watch
I want all those awful pricks right out
and taught how to behave
in my garden, your garden,
the one of our Eden!
NOW!

- I want those pricks to learn how to transform
their ways of telling parents
that they had done things wrong.

2. “A pleasant smell of coffee woke the child-up in soft waves of flavoured loneliness bringing the memory of a true friend with the breeze of the wind dancing its ways through the open window, filling with charm the room. She was much too young for coffee memories or memories of friendship like that, still, the strong impression made on her brains carrying her heart to realms of tenderness was comparable to that of nostalgia. Strange how coffee... 
- Oh, look! A spy! She was watching a new friend coming in to join the dance of a unicorn brought by the winds: a bee was humming around a flower of the imaginary that was supposed to stand proud in the vase. ‘What to read about? What book to start reading from the small collection up there, in the corner of news?’ she wondered. As she  got up for heading to the corner another bee entered the room, a wasp still checking the edges of the window as if afraid not to pass through before inspection. Pretty elegant spies sent around to keep me company. Would you be my friends? I mean, for today. Tomorrow will be another day, you’ll have to go for some flowers and fulfill your destinies and I’ll have to move on with mine. Still, some friendly company for a while wouldn’t hurt any pride, ...as long as I respect your ways and you respect mine, she gave away the thought her pointing-finger on her chin like guessing things out of the unicorn breath. The child was an elegant being, looking like a fairy-tale little princess, the daughter of a goddess and a king. Her simple room here, up to the country-side where they used to retreat as if normal people for a while, was a practice that used to help this child find friends more easily. They didn’t want to be that special, this special family! They loved their people; why not try to be around for them while having a good time with them, fighting their fights and joining them in recreational times? After all, this is the only way for them to behave like the best leaders when out of here and into the world they belong to, the one they came from to be. for a little while, just like them all, those who’d call themselves ‘normal people’.... - Am not in the mood for “The Dance of the Unicorn’ today, the girl spoke loud. I’ll take the book with me and a few more things to serve me well up on the hill where the oak’s telling his tales and old jokes to the winds and their birds, to the underworld and the skies! I’ll watch the sea hidden behind these hills and take some pictures too! I’ll make my painting shine and my words will feed those hungry birds singing around. Then I’ll be feeling free to run and dance and paint once more whatever I will get to explore with the ease of a breeze.”

- At least that, father...; 
at least this mom...!
At least we did try to do much more
than nothing for our land;
than nothing for your lands.

3. “Loneliness was a blessing for her. It can be a blessing always to someone needing for their times on their own,  Sometimes they last for longer than you might think - many getting used to it and wishing no more trouble - other times they last for the while it takes for one to get prepared for a different next stage. This special case we’re talking about, being kept company by such nice forms of existence nobody would ever think of messing or dealing with; since they don’t deal. There’s no deal other than what they know as the right thing to do. Always helped surrounding herself with the best aura, the best shape, the best, very much needed life-scents; only the ones you’d feel pleased with. So, every single human lived their own lives around her without being able to watch closely  this Étoile Rallumée, seeing instead Kynareth in all her splendour. 
To him, loneliness was a thing bearable as long as not deep enough a silenced echo revived. Always on the road he kept looking for the public spaces to offer him the pleasant humming of those normal humans feeding his tired brain and his hurt heart, a broken spirit, some might say, getting himself back on his feet. He didn’t deserve this, some might just say; others would be thrilled to see him crushed forever. You cannot be an important enough creature unless much hated and despised. Hard to take it all by yourself and very hard to learn this on your own as you learn you’re not taking it for your own well-being too but it is part of a deal that one day must get to its break so it set free the one chained with some honourable chains, if one give a chance to the perspective we’re watching things now from - nobody forces anyone into anything, these days; we only get trapped sometimes looking for our ways back to dignity and hope. And trust me, there’s a lot of hope to feed us all! There’s a lot of hope and dreams and love plus-minus other feelings flying around the flame.

Before the answers offered
there was a greater call
to action. 
Reactions are going to follow when done. 
Heavy utopia, I’m learning about myself, 
the rocks I have thrown to you
when I was a kid too hurt, 
a child you’d say, a child of our Lord,
 another one of the children of God. 
Seeking for answers, thinking they knew,
knowing that they had it all 
and everything was theirs to become
the greatest judges,
the strongest flaws,
the niches for survival acts to have the comfort to create
the comfort that we want. 
oh, and the comfort we want! 
We want, we want... 
all the comfort that we want

“It might not seem as if I do, to you, but I’m still crying, my soul is crying with you for all that felt and was unfair. How else could I show some care but by doing... doing whatever I can so we eased this stupid pain of ours, the stupid pain we need: much better than the one of not knowing how it felt. 
I will say that you’re dead to me, you’re probably the way you need to be. If not, I will be doing what I have to do, my best that is, to make things possible for you - but please, deserve a better truth!” 
*
No more garbage no more hell,
the utopian society we dream of, describe and dare to wish for
with such great ease, the ease of the ones not getting involved,
not taking action against what seems to be wrong. 
Wouldn’t you like some colour of a life that brings-out beauty
and the beautiful into your home? 
Wouldn’t you trade a naughty painful duty for a naughty but awesome one?
:
they say it is all about the perspectives you choose to use and embrace, 
I say the same; 
It is all about the power of our brains to help and be of help. 
It lies only in the brain
that power to make it and make a great stand. 
*
Partiality spoken, now I’ll get myself going on,
on this track I am up for making things happen:
some new road that’s old.
Could I have messed with my God, 
could I have chosen right? 
The best parents to help us through!?
Am I, a naughty, naughty reckoning racoon?
was it too hard for me using the word “creating”
when right or wrong to do, 
‘making the impression you wanted me to?
I guess it was,
perhaps only boring;
so long.

“In the wake of an owl pass she opened her eyes and there he was, the wolf. “Here, I brought you some food. You must be starved to death, poor thing!” - Don’t under-estimate me! You trained me well, didn’t you? “Yes, I suppose I did”, he sighed the words out like whistle. “Look, I’m sorry for what happened.” - Why? It wasn’t your fault they hated me that much! I don’t know why! Perhaps it was a test or something! “Looks more like a revenge to me!” The Raven spoke! - Oh, look at you! “I agree with the Raven. It does look like revenge; you know, family business!” - Yes, well... this should be only for my best! Now I am strong enough and having friends like you, I must say, makes one girl feel invincible. “Just don’t take yourself too seriously”, the Raven accused. “You bloody black-pain in the ass!” the wolf joked. “That’s me! Always a pain in the ass! Always a joke! Lucky you, though, when your rival almost slaughtered you on the battle field! I almost had enough of him, that day!” The girl and the wolf laughed. “Yes, you almost did so, didn’t you!?” Disrupted a moment by the thrill of a mouse trying to escape the claws of the white night-owl having a nice time chasing a chrysalis and finding real pray right under its beak. “A fat one”, the owl explained as he deciphered the code on their faces conserving curiosity like a treasure of gold. - Wow! You must have been very hungry. “No, dear! I was not! I just never miss an opportunity to have a nice meal.” Who knows when I’ll grab another one this easily!?” “Which reminds me, the wolf interrupted, of yourself and this nice little... what do you call them, burgers? I brought you!” - It’s actually a fancy piece of pie that looks like a sandwich, pretty close to the shape of a burger. They become more and more inventive with these easy meals; and I’m not there to watch them and enjoy the time. “There’s also something nice and pleasant in that bag! A surprise for you!” She opened the bag and discovered a little sweet treat she used to love having. - Oh, wow! These used to be my favourites! How did you know!” “I have my ways”, the wolf said watching the black-bird in complicity. “You do, don’t you?” the bird pointed out ironically. “I’d go for a lucky guess”, the owl spoke innocently distracted by the chrysalis she was fascinated by for a while. “Lucky guess, pff!” the raven puffed arrogantly. “See? That’s why I don’t hang-out with owls anymore. They tend to act childishly aloof.” - Humm... interesting combination! the girl observed. “What combination? What are you talking about?” the scrutinizing eyes of the raven matched the curiosity in the tone of the wolf asking. “This gift of yours! She opened her palm and showed them a sphere that in the light of a moon-spear of joy started glowing its surface bright and a little cold. After a few moments of silence the owl dared to ask using a gentle deep tone: -”Where did you get that from?” - I don’t know! I assume the Raven or the Wolf gave it to me. You said you had something special for me, didn’t you? she asked. The wolf’s amazement was great as he couldn’t speak anymore, thus showing that he had no idea of such a nice gesture he was about to be held responsible for. - I just woke-up in the middle of the night, she confessed, having this one in my palm. “It wasn’t me, dear, the one who placed this stone into your hand!” the wolf confessed. “Don’t look at me”, the Raven proudly rested her quest for an answer there”, among her wild friends.
..
I can be very funny, sometimes;
when I watch myself from a certain distance I realise how funny I was.
I didn’t know , it is true, how is that a bird can dance this beautifully, humanly 
but unearthly, somehow shining like a goddess, sometimes like a god.
I didn’t know that my science hurt you all so bad: 
In the end, our organisms were all to rot 
and make ourselves useful to the earth from which we were told that we came from. 
Right? 
Am I right? 
Yes, we were all treated like some kind of a garbage can for what we did or didn’t do;
(try not to be such a miracle to myself and You)
we were all treated with the disrespect and disregard that we want, because, if we’d like to be treated well,
for what we are and what we felt we were to become
we got ourselves either too pregnant or too down,
too much of a lousy piece of material to work with ‘till the end, 
if too good to be true then why not send her to hell,
so, she’ll send everyone to hell! 
Let us burn, burn, 
burn-out in hell for what we were, 
since we all fell
down from illusion, up for some passions, 
The passions of all saints, away for the storming well...
to where all our hearts and soups might dwell!
..
We’re scientists, my friends. 
We do have everything we want and dreamed of, everything we love to care about!
Not all of us are evil!
Not all of us are bad!
..
On unknown weaknesses, overwhelming food for the brains, 
a treat
for the spirit to burn
the entire sadness we’ve grown inside. 
I couldn’t do much better than then with no combined, somehow, conclusions to serve me as a starting point
 for some new papers;
excluding what is not to be excluded. 
But still, this thought that in acceptance we can create and hope for a result 
that is the vision in the past, not the one keeping going on in my head. 
I could always see the beauty you are capable of doing: kindly projected colours for our eyes to explore, 
a scientist combining delicacy with power, love with the tower of hope.
on the top-peaks of our Babylon
the orchestra calls our people to meditation;
we could,
I did imagine, I dreamed about this, 
frig around for a while!

- Hi! 
“Wake-up, girl! she spoke to herself! You’ve got work to do!” her face meeting its  reflection on the cold shiny door felt refreshed when her brains responded well to the medicine. Just as she was getting her relief from almost a painfully burning thought she heard the lock twisting and turning emitting vibrations that got her instantly awake. 
- Hi! 
- Ah, hi! The expression on his face a little puzzled. 
- I brought the documents you asked for. 
- Ah!... the documents, yes! 
- We need them for... oh, hi! I didn’t know you had company! 
- Hello! 
- Here, I’ll leave these on the desk and we could work on them later, perhaps... no, let’s work on this tomorrow. Now, I’ll get some things prepared too and you’ll show me your ideas about this picture we’re trying to create and things should be just fine!
He tried to mumble a few words, his eyes begging her not to go away but she didn’t notice. She was too caught-up in her ideas and ideals, all rushing through her veins, to get the clear mind to see what was actually going on. Keeping things simple seemed more like a better plan to her. Simply honest and true. 
- Bye! the lady behind him smiled her salute. 
- Have a nice time! She belled down her strong sparkling tolls! ‘Terrifying a life led in two’, she thought. ‘Terrifying led all alone, just like me. I sometimes wonder why we’re here. I sometimes seem to know the answers; hum! not feeling strong enough to live again!’ she surprised herself discovering.”
.
Wanting to believe that you can go through the entire thing once more, 
- forget about it - 
- always remember - 
-never forget, never hold grudge on -
-Uuuh!- 
Hard, tough-worded heart-felt emotions! For the sake of telling the truth. 
Too hard to face it, perhaps, so I’d rather die with dignity? 
Too hard to continue like this with no hope for redemption, 
no hope for that road
which would be happiness.
They have denied me the rights of being whatever I might have hoped for! 
*
Good friend, never bother again for a good friend in need: 
Don’t bother, don’t you bother for yourself!
Never think of bothering for anyone you see they need your help!
They’re not your friends!
*
The world was never there for you and you were never there for anyone at all!
HOw’s that for a kind old bastard you kept mocking with the name 
of something that used to be a saint,
no longer a friend of humanity;
No longer a friend for my friend, the caring... 
this train should have been left behind a long, long time ago. 
It’s not about my own faults coming back, I wish they weren’t here to make me fall asleep. 
I wish my fears were beaten by those tears. 
.
On the tracks of the train station she waits silently, 
courageous a minute of wait in between cold steel lines. 
There is this story, one that I wanted to write, 
I have only a brief comment to it and the shorts of it’s insights, 
it’s all about the heart, the art of one heart that’s trying to rewrite some version of a haunted by a memory
darkened soul.
In pain you were, a drink or a medicine, the sip of something hot or cold, 
to take away the pain! 
- Be my medicine tonight!
Be my star, be my hope! 
Let me do the same for you when you need it so!

 “The boy was looking up the fruit tree wishing for some berries and little prunes to take home. Up near the graveyard things seemed to be nice and kind enough, silence reflecting that there was no one around to see him. It was Father Ron’s property but he didn’t seem to be home that afternoon. -Perhaps he’s taking a nap. I might just take a few: they’re ripe! So, he reached for a couple of little prunes, then took a few more. A pocket full of little prunes he thought enough so the damage wouldn’t be too great and left. He looked up the house, checking the window once again, making sure that he wasn’t going to get caught. then he left for some berries. 
He kept filling a little basket all day long, taking it home where mother was about to tell a short little story to her little ones. 
- Oh, you’re back! And brought some berries too. 
- And a few prunes. One for each of us! They’re ripe! Here! he handed one to each sibling and one to his mom. 
- Where did you snatched these ones from? 
- I just took a few. Nobody will notice, don’t worry. 
- Okay, but don’t go fooling around on people’s properties taking away everything you feel like having! 
- I don’t do that. This was just it! I’ll never do that again, I promise. 
- Alright! Make that a promise to keep! 
Supper-time fell right in time for the bellies of the children to start growling. They ate a soup and afterwards they had some marmelade then they fell asleep, one by one giving-up the pleasant warm waves of their mothers’ voice telling a little bedtime story. The morning next day found them relaxed and happy. Right in front of their house a large basket full of little prunes holding a little piece of paper with a message in. The mother discovered the letter and read: ‘Have them, please, as they are ripe and were bound to perdition. I wasn’t going to eat them all and I thought that it is better for you to have them instead of the worms. I hope you’ll enjoy them. F.R.’
Father Ron smiled that day like a saint. The angel inside him spoke out a beautiful prayer then they had lunch and later on supper brought more light to the house. 
.
It is all about art, all about the heart that we’re losing; 
it’s all about gaining back what we want, leaving behind the coldness of the rock-heart of a star. 
It’s all about the faith we know as real, 
there is nothing more in between than the pain and joyous hubris, 
reflected up in blues and angry storms by the skies of our memories
growing cold. 
It’s all about making it happen, making it real, that dream, 
that burning wish you thought and worked for, 
sufficiently long a time for you to ask for what you want; 
in return for the favours of letting something cursed or blessed behind, for the needs of those humans
not letting themselves down
...
‘Keep hoping... dreaming, loving what I do,
actively
but I find myself deprived from the will of losing what I never wanted to become
- I’d rather die than be that sick and nauseating thing - 
(don’t call those humans) 
(don’t call them gods)
(they’re awfulness with legs and prides)
(to take them home, where they belong to - not)
(it’s a choice I will hate you forever forcing someone to ‘embrace’)
(not a path)
thus losing more than I was able to hope for.
~ take our embrace! ~

There is this story, this wonderful lovely story of life
I wanted to write about when found here, 
where everything seems to be asking for its beauty to kill the shame 
of being nothing but an object-subject, a moving sign on a map; 
-If only you knew what an honourable thing these times, to you!
If only you could guess! Perhaps not for the entirety of the place,
then again, relaxing, rewarding a time 
when spent out there with the friends that seemed to count - at least for a while, 
a short while, always too short a while. I could laugh and I could cry along with them, 
for the same reasons, for the same pains, for the same prize. 
.
There is this story, this story of life
I wanted to write about whenever too sad or preoccupied with myself; 
whenever things started to be meaningful. 
.
You are so beautiful! 
The light you came to spread around here, showing what I meant to you! 
The story of a beautiful child. 
It’s about letters that kept flowing in Pi. 
.
Eclectic values on the importance of the interpretation of all sorrows; 
I’m making myself laugh now as I realize that this reunion of stars doesn’t fit me well,
it’s only perfect for myself to pay for a pride hurt, a heart much loved, 
 much too hurt, I’d regretfully observe. 
.
-Newest precision created, 
moving round and around, 
a sound familiar bringing back the music that’s fulfilling my needs: 
-Why did you have to impersonate it with such cruel honesty? 
-Why and how can you be this perfect for me!? 
At this point, I’m not even sure if I’m planting the seeds of the truth or those of some brilliant irony
looking stupid enough to be counted as bliss 
and remembered  
for a whole fresh season-century in its entirety. 
They took away the bliss! 
They took away the meaning and the feeling of trust! 
Our hopes, once up, now crushed! 
And I am supposed to support them!
.
She’s still proud of herself, she is doing so well!
I could see her pride on his face! ? How did you get her spirit, monsieur, the loveliest fake? 
-Yes, I’ll take inspiration, I’ll take everything I can from you! One day all this will get to be very useful! 
And this is a promise! Not a warning, not for you to be blamed and feel ashamed!
*
“I prefer to live now because I know that if I succeed in doing something about my life and for myself then others will get helped too, others will do so too.”
Whoever is against me is against my god! 
Whoever is against a human doing nothing wrong is just against themselves and the entire world leading a life in; 
the world you attack is the world that will eventually attack you. 
.
What went so wrong? Aren’t we all in the same pot of glass-like honey-sea,
swimming and sipping the knowledge of others, 
giving a hand when forced by a heart 
that was meant to mend an awful scar? 
What went wrong?
You were sacrificed for your children, for your own child.
.
A destiny given through hopes, dreams and wishes, 
Through blood, through emotions, to reason that’s gathering living cells in one place. 
A destiny offered to each and every one! 
A teacher can always offer you one!
Teachers will always offer you one - hopefully a much better one. 
.
The Artist Way to no way, to nowhere we go, 
we struggle, we cry, we lose our faith in people, then we enlighten, 
we find our ways. 
-A saviour was sent to your rescue from what made you struggle in pain.
In a friend, they found their strength, in a pattern.
 But I still want to believe that the poor girl didn’t deserve such a treatment. 
A rescuer sentenced to rescue her, always! 
A boy in need will receive his angel to protect him. 
.
Unfortunately, I do not want to know what’s behind this old curtain. 
.
Afraid of being happy since everything seemed to be quite a menace. 
Afraid of loving people, gaining her courage back 
to get up from her bed and move on with a track 
about the love she wanted, the one she needed most. 
That’s never a good option for those who cannot offer to themselves 
another chance, another way, another time, perhaps. 
*

“I was willing to live the life you imposed and survive like a decent cunt - whatever that would mean, love! - learning from your angels, much gifted and long helped, learning from your saints, all treated the same. 
I’m not sorry for learning, for trying, and being gifted with the best parents in the world! When I woke-up, I did what I could and will keep doing it! I’ll break your stupid law and do something about this life of mine, this life of ours! You will not punish me and the ones that I love with your eternal sorrows! 
- This is The End of something that could have been beautiful for you. Are you going to decide on which side you should stay!? Since we all decided and well we did, it’s true. 
- I have no clue, I have no clue what they are talking about.
 - You!
 My family doesn’t deserve to be treated like garbage! My family will be respected and loved for as much love they can offer, for as much as they did for us and the world! My family is beauty! My family is love. My family is not you but those who really know how to give something that’s truly beautiful.” 
*
What about receiving? 
Are we entitled to receive something beautiful after offering something needed?
(someone asked)
*
What to do, what to do with something beautiful and true like you!?
What can we do? What can a demon do with something beautiful and true?
What can we do?
Why all those awful nightmares? 
Why don’t you speak of them too?!
A man and a woman, that speak of the hell they do,
the hell they apply to the ones
they consider 
perhaps too available 
to accomplish a miracle
then go live their hell.
*
On the road of progression I walk so I’d be strong and convinced that I can make it too. 
Never mess with a stranger too much, if you can! 
Believe that there’s a God who would know how to love you and stop punishing you 
for what you didn’t do 
to the world. 
.
“Stop punishing yourselves for what we did to you all!”
Stop punishing yourselves for praying or not for a daughter or a son! 
Stop punishing yourselves for thinking you create! 
Stop punishing the people who’d love to be with us, 
on the stage, in the real world, 
The places we know!

“-I don’t understand this concept of life you’re trying to convince me to embrace and live. I never liked your human bonds and family fights but tried to have some fun - unfortunately, one cannot mess with the house of hell on earth.  I thought I learned a few things, a few tricks about how things should be working but I failed. And now I see myself forced to make a choice that’s as bad as going out there and facing once more those real people having nothing to be ashamed of, nothing to feel uncomfortable about, nothing to bother them at all. I don’t want to be part of this anymore. She came to tell me the truth. The truth I was supposed to run away from. The truth I was..., I am going to use to make that change possible. I cannot live like this, anymore. nobody can. Nobody should. We should be able to be thankful for each and every day and night, for every achievement and for all the beautiful things accomplished. For the enlightenment, for the love and care, for the duties and the will to make something beautiful out of something terribly wrong and painful.  We can all do this, we’re all part of it. It’s just easier for some and heavier a job to take for others.  Okay, not a job, understood - still... sometimes we feel as if forced to take that job consuming our lives, turning us into the vermin one would never consider loving anymore because hatred proved better. I still cannot believe this, but the way this reason works is the way it always did: Better - in what way?  from which point of view?
- There is no concept. You live or you don’t. You embrace life and what’s in for you or you don’t. It seemed to me that you won’t embrace anything because you don’t know what’s been created for you. It must be the very fact that you don’t. Otherwise I’d be luckier and happier a child. Seeing you murdered and ... it just killed my dignity and my soul! I hate those pesky vermin! I hate those creators of miracles for others more than for the one who deserved something much healthier than before. 
- Define healthier! 
- Oh, boy!”

She is a shooting star, your faithful meteor coming to fulfil one dream, 
one wish at a time, 
she loves you all and somehow, maybe somehow you’ll all get what you want.
You cannot touch her though, this shooting star! 
You do not want to, she will fry and burn you away if you do so!
(She did that to all of us, she helped us get to feel like a star)
.
Stop punishing those people learning more and more about what doesn’t seem to be
so difficult!

Go find the child you left behind, 
go find the child you sent away 
with no protection and no aim, 
the one you frightened
with the past they lived, 
your monstrous living battle-field.

Not all of us get honey after a lesson like this applied! 
Not all of us available for some more of your lying thoughts of wisdom and love, 
nice living things for the love of God, 
all done in the name of God...
Am I still puzzled which god is used for what? 
Taught, educated, shown 
our ways, put all to our places
because you are the great and we are small, 
those small rodents that never crawl.

well, well, well.
Punish them well enough, 
well, well.

“- I cannot play with people’s feelings like that for real. I cannot be that way, I’ve seen how badly this can hurt - not all the nerves touched can answer brilliantly just like not all of them are bright and strong enough to help more life to be offered from the trouble taken to fry some eggs and prepare the most wonderful breakfast for a friend or a passenger around here, he spoke. I am a chef, you know!? A great one, the best one, actually. Only I’ve evolved. Now I am also a producer of shows. Would you care for a show to be bothered for?
- Sure! Let’s have some fun!
- Nobody makes things seem fun like this one, here! How does this one sound to you? 
- Interesting!
- This your note? 
“I got used to it as they got used to it too...Where did you get this from?

She starts checking her pockets as if there must have been something to find there. You! 
- Now, now! I didn’t went to look in your pockets. Look again. She checked them more carefully and found what she was looking for. 
- Ah! Ok. So this is another piece of the puzzle, right?
- Yep. 
- Finally getting somewhere, brother!
- Sorry, I don’t know you! Not my sister!

10. He didn’t need love, what he wanted was to live a peaceful life without getting haunted by feelings of all kind... Love was something long forgotten, something he got cured of. He’d stick to his principles, from now on, he’ll do the right thing; his ideas and thoughts he called his own, never bothering for anyone else but himself and those he could identify as worthy for the time given to be worthy of his merciful show of care: painless. - Always here, for you, for you, and for myself too. Always there, where I need to be, where I belong, where I’m supposed to be. 
He knows what to do and he knows why he does it. Love to him meant trouble, meant sickness and crushing hearts... the old experiences of history - well taught.  
- See? I didn’t have to go through all this useless life proposals to get to understand what is to be done for us never to ask why. 
For Sanctity and strength: 
- Here I am! Here I am! 
For a life that’s been squared. 
Make it fair, please make it fair!

For nothing, no one works as much as you do,

If it’s for nothing than I’d better find a way to kill myself

“Our God gave us the time to do something about our lives, our decisions, our high hopes and dreams! 
About our feelings, about our struggle, about our work; 
to extract knowledge from the world we lived in and made use of the ways we wanted
without harming too badly another human lie! 
How clean and how beautiful a soul from pure light!
How pure can it be 
to make us look much better than we could have ever dreamed? 
How funny a joke that’s hurting your kind heart? 
How stupid the reasons for which you thought you should fight? 

11. With her, all the inspiration he needed was right there, in front of his eyes, inside his heart, in his soul, out there, even if left alone he was never without her... Always with ‘his girl’! He couldn’t make it in any other way... that’s who he was... (that’s who we are! That’s who we are! a couple of ghostly images come by to ask for their sweet treat!). That’s who he was and he wouldn’t change that for anything in the world; he wouldn’t change his heart for anything and anyone; he had everything he wanted with her and because of her they managed to be happy all the time. Having everything you ever dreamed of because you have on your side the very one you need! can you imagine that? What kind of a protected angel, all-powerful and kind, most wonderful beauty is that?
Perhaps you know what I’m talking about, dear reader, perhaps you don’t but what none of you know is that there is a lady who did that for them both and a couple of other ones she thought deserving; a lady much hated for doing this - one lady hated by hell itself for getting the hell out of herself, inviting it to sent to the needed jobs the ones to protect such powerful long-lasting-love. A favour made with tears and deals of pain and blood only a woman can take... a world of mistakes that is kept alive by this mistake entitled: the woman. Who knows: hopefully someone will care about this kind of a world we’re speaking about. Perhaps I’m not seeing things wrong and women still get to be pretty and wonderful, no matter what, for the men they deserved... somehow.

How awesome, how nice?

‘There is no guilt much greater than the one of trying to save the world! 
I was told this before, there’s nothing new about it! 
I am not pretending to know it for sure! 
Just look around and see that many have said this before.
The same ways some, in other ways too; 
we’re only trying to find the perfect combinations 
for something that will never be explained. 
Strange love can never be explained. 
The real one’s even worse! 
It’s easier to take things as they are
and fight for what you believe in.
The world can never explain things better than it already did.

A loner someone was and since we do need some loners around here let’s just not let them go to a waste and offer them something sweet in return for their favours of not bothering us too much with their unwanted presence. Lonely as a loner this human presence learns something new every day and keeps exploring what was already explored, combining and offering the change of some rebirth of her fire. Go and see the fire in a heart all churches speak about. Go see the fire in the hearts of people having a nice time wherever they are! Go and see the fire in the people doing what they want, those things they love... Aren’t they the most beautiful thing on earth? Go see a doctor if you think that this was wrong!

 Die! 
Die for a new life!
Die forever from a world that got sickened with your infectious love! 
Die! Die! Die! 
Until there’s nothing else to do but live the way you wanted, 
the way that’s selfish but true!
Die, die, die! 
There’s no other duty but being true to yourself! 
Die, please, die! 
Help yourself out of there now! Disease of our world! 
Please try not to be more helpful!
Please try not to help this disaster continue!

The world of imagination,
 a perfect place  
most delightful, most beautiful!

Never spread ashes in this world which has nothing to say wrong about what you do! 
Die, die, die from the world 
too good to be true. 
Nobody can be too good to be true! 
If science can help, science will do! 
Die, die, die! Destroy what’s eating you alive, 
what’s making you ugly inside; 
What keeps you feel wrong about the right thing to do. 
Die, die, die for what you want and what you love, 
for who you want, for the ones you truly love!

The Idealist 
.
They are killing education and fun-education every day in this country and I an supposed to be okay with it? Shouldn’t I do something about it?! 
“It’s been a while since I found some way to be okay with who and what I am, with what I was doing for the immensity of needs and purposes one piece of paper (filled with curious concepts, story-lines and thoughts gathered to be kept forever in the recycling processes of what one might call creation) can produce. (Aren’t I too young for this, you’d ask! Perhaps I am, maybe I’m simply not...) 
Now I find myself at the cross-roads where I just make guesses about what to do for the best of a community that, inevitably affects other communities too. It’s a trend - common be it or not - that we speak of in every age of an empire brought back to pages of history, a place from where they can incite us to many different reverie-types, many different actions and reactions, producing and reproducing themselves constantly on different grounds, on different stages and screens, sometimes burning vividly inside someone’s daring and brave heart - enough a reason offered to imagine things their own ways... 
Thinking about ‘our own ways’ now... But, wait! No! I should be focusing on my purposes, many of which do have some educational value, like it or not, be it familiar a piece of an artistic element or intriguingly new a thing. 
I’ll simply leave a note to myself for when I’ll find it entertaining and fun enough to make a ‘run through the fields of gold’ like I was just about to do. 
So, yes! I am against this killing machine, not understanding, perhaps, that I am participating to the same show in which we inevitably get to feel the need of killing something for a new thing... Sometimes it manifests itself as a simple must other times it  is about replacing one thing with another, a sufficient activity great enough to do the killer of a job - the killing of a friend not being much of a friend. 
We kill thus, one another, destroy each others’ castles, if we can, and we do that every day for the same reasons (basically, the same). I kept asking like a fool: what about some reconstruction!? How would it be if... but it seems that I am talking to myself because... You hated me enough so I got here! In a state of confusion I might get to believe or make myself believe that it was all about love... but it wasn’t. It never is, all about love, no matter how much we try to convince ourselves that we can be that way!  We need a piece of a living star so we can go for the melting away  of all that hatred tool and make it slice and wound the not so innocent, healing the ones who...- my guess is that each and every one of you is going to pick their favourite; so why bother to be too specific, right now?  - Pick me! Pick me! a child would have the spirit and heart to say ... or do... Pick me! Pick us! ... Never cease loving those lovely children, please! 
Now, I am a fighter! This is who I always was! This is what I was trained to be! This is what I’ll always be! You cannot change the nature of a human being as you cannot change the nature of angels and demons! Can one change God? 
(we are god-like creatures! - this misconception can go on, in my opinion, as I choose to believe in something of this nature just like my cat chooses to show me when she ‘thinks’ it is time for a snack, a charming moment for her to be adored, time to play or just the time for us not to bother ‘the princess’!) A fighter, I am (sometimes going blind to the ugliness of some aspects in the individuals meeting with and their products’ results - lovely term, this one: products’ following this context.), a fighter and this is what I will always be! You cannot change the nature of who I am!    
Think about it this way: think that we can only imagine ourselves as changed during the process of our transformations; We put ourselves to tests, take examples, drop examples, recalculate, reevaluate the shape of who we are and who we’re waiting for to be (like) in our entirety. Then, one day, we get tired and we ask to be saved from the entanglement we’ve got ourselves into (so voluntarily that it became unwillingly!). We fight for that freedom and power to burn and burn ... and burn, once more, ... in the name of God,. .. in the name of Creation, ... 
Burn!

- One day all this will be over, he spoke to himself, and I will be up for and heading to The City of Life!”

Hopefully it is going to be a Dream Life! 
This Life: 
Another Gateway to our suicide.

- I killed myself! That is the truth! You had nothing with getting me where I am now! Did you!?

Did you really think that she was going to be (all) that forgiving?

Shock-waves and Safety-Pillows 
.
Do I want to be wise, now? 
I’m walking and waiting, pretending that I am meditating, 
exploring the possibilities of what I can imagine as cleaner and fancier, 
beautiful lies,
placed and projected to inspire our school-yards and the children of all ages 
to actions of hatred and love
transposed into the images,
a thing by frustrations provoked. 
Don’t you love it? 
This issued frost, the very fact that no one’s involved in your inner storms but the very abstractions 
called
feelings and hopes all broken?
By whom?
- Oh, by no one at all! 
I must have been confused all along!
I’ll just keep pretending that there’s nothing wrong! 
Why spit in the face some venom, some panic, some tears? 
*
Find a cure, find a cure,
find a place that’s secure
for your dangers to live decently a change.
*
Why show-off our troubling griefs, 
our pathetic intentions and our despicable feelings
...
of love? 
Ha ha! He he! 
They know how to deal with ‘these-type-of-things’. 
* 
Are you sure that you want my own life? 
It is sweet! Sweet and gentle, so kind, the kindest one carried by a spirit that’s been always around
for us all to embrace and create something nice from.
Burn, burn! Burn, now, just like torches, burn down the coldness of the knights
that never could put their weapons on the ground. 
Down, down, and of with your heads, 
It is finally their times to feel free to act more like a brave king and leader! 
Down, down and off with their heads, 
in the name of our queen, in the name of our kingdom! 
Down, down and off with their heads!
Those invaders, all real...
some time ago, they happened to be real. 
Why are you helping me cold, fine dressed-up for a party raven? 
..
If you need a reason then I need a goal, 
if you need my goal then give me an answer: 
Let’s burn! 
Burn, burn, burn out of here! 
These feelings of cold! 
Let’s burn all this iron and turn it into the blades that we need, the ones that we want! 
..
Down, down, burn it down, this tunnel, if you can! 
The catacombs are made of stone for the best reasons,
for the strangest doors to show you the faces of those you’ll never hurt, 
you’ll never know
...
they still remind you of 
someone you used to know;
our ravens, 
a lot of ravens
you couldn’t hate but help
and ask for, 
cry for and then forget: 
in time right to remember
They’re safe, they’re refined;
forget about losing their time with your estranged day-dreaming,
your concepts and your ideas moving
too fast,
perhaps not burning slowly enough. 
..
.
Empty words and words of meaning
.
I heard from you, it’s time for me to understand that I am nothing but a human being! 
It’s time to look for things You taught me about
in life,
It is time to create the new paths that we want. 
The recreation of our lost but much remembered loves and passions, 
meanings and thoughts; 
it’s nothing but concepts gathered for the fun and amusement of the old ones that never die. 
They know best, 
the ones who got to be eternal, 
the ones who went through hell
for what and whom they loved. 
..
They never play with fire like us, the children of True Love. 
I hate You! I hate you for this infernal poor show!
..
From less than expected you will make more,
but there’s always a condition, there’s always a rule to follow. 
We always fall in love with a good sorrow! 
We always find our peace beyond what’s great. 
The sacrifices He Did, 
Remembered forever, 
Forever will She be remembered. 
.
Please God, heal that soul I unfairly made cry and twist and turn around, for nothing! 
Please, Lord! It is you the only one to help us through!
.
“- Don’t let me die for your money! I will not die like this! 
I want to die for the love of God and His Amazing brilliance!”
.
- Upsetting as this might be, this is all true.
Please, let me cry once more for the fault of not being your son or you daughter anymore!
A good mother helped you succeed.
A good mother cared enough to take a deep breath and do the right thing. 
A good mother learned about what was possible for her to do and what was not.
.
“-Please God, help me help!?” 
Perhaps this is for another one! Perhaps we will mend 
That scar which wasn’t there to be healed
by her son, the healer. 
.
“- Love of my life! Where are you!? 
Where am I? 
What’s this?!”
*
Please, help me never lose the most beautiful gift!

Never help me never lose the most beautiful gift!

Thinking, 
no feelings, 
letting things flow;
open text-books to chase and bend
then run through ideas
with your self-hired head
paying the visits to the library-fun days. 
Some things are for me too, 
some others may escape through
this cracked tear of glass 
suspended 
above the grey menacing asphalts.
In between two angels

The Spectacle of Life
.
Two hands reaching out in the darkness of your times asking for a way out. 
Two hands of white marble-cold, bringing sanity to the tired and drained.
No more tears now, it’s over. Don’t cry for me now. 
Please, stop crying. 
.
Two hands out of hell reaching to the face of a human that’s been kept in tears for too long.
.in cries of desperation.
Wake up! 
Slapping the face wouldn’t help but shaking her when almost dead 
made her come back to life! 
.
Everything happens if only deserved. 
Take me out of this place! I’m not your toy to be played with! 
Why did you put me through this?
ONE OF THE MANY CHARACTERS ASKING FOR THE SAME THINGS. 
.
By the window an angel head was watching, eyes sorrowed, 
His face made me think about nothing more than what I had to know.
right there, on the spot, I had to make a decision.
Too many minds and hearts to think of; grew tired - I had to leave! 
-I should have left-
(she spoke to herself) 
.
He was sad, 
desperation was frozen on his pale face, 
his eyes lost in tears got darker and darker until one could never see them again.
.
A reflection on the surface of a window panel, white framed. 
Missing the outside world, she takes a few steps away, I do the same, watching how busy we are 
with our walk of shame, with our walk of pride, 
with our walks of hopes and denial.
(of things that we want to believe are not inevitable) 
.
The Sphinx shows its whiteness of teeth, important matters speaking,
about
the poet of the mountains enjoying the sound of the winds 
of a fresh morning flight you hear things, 
you know words, 
you feel breezes of emotions. 
So you feed your spirit. 
.
The Sphinx is enjoying its dedicated times 
to perfection of the ideals lost; 
a faint trace of tiredness: 
the Sphinx doesn’t ask for any other happiness than this one, 
The stone one!

The Glass Tear and The Paint One 
.
- A nightmare to you, I must have been, 
she confessed earlier that day
to the man in her dreams, last age, 
now standing in front of her with both eyes open wide, 
all ears 
and thoughts behind the unnamed colors 
of appearance
having the best of treats he ever had sliced down
for the feast of both sides. 
- I loved a lot! So many wings have flown away! 
Departed visions, 
lovable friends and neighbours. 
I am alone, in silence I stand
each day 
and meditate.
.
The grounds of time, hilarious in spaces between spaces;
they’re hue-ing things,
expanding
activity. 
there’s a lot of freedom in your wold, just believe so.
All turned into construction material 
the amounts of danger. 
But Time is Time
(he confessed and he cried)
(I confess and I cry) 
and I am who you are, 
and boy this feels spectacular! 
oh, why!
Wanna’ know why? 
Why didn’t you trust him goodbye?
.
So, I am Y
(let’s not be just too playful)
with words
.
- Rising-up! There’s still light inside the room of my torso-heart
I only have to find the courage to let it show through.
.
- A sweet monologue, those things I have said to you,
 never spoken, never reflecting the truth
in its entirety! 
- And I should be expecting for the miracle in my own hands to happen!

The Glass Tear depicted from the panel imagined as a work of art
Some-time! forgiven for a distant past that’s spinning round and round
In its circles, broken,
only dots can be seen
squaring roundly and vividly
in pairs of honey-bee
Amber-ed.
Regrouped two armies of the same kind and species,
collaborating:
White, inside  
enlightened.
.
Shared for a new age, 
something to hope for as the best of times emerge.
It’s linear, it’s round, 
its private places blending colours of infinite protection and guidance; 
it belongs to the path that destroys to construct,
a sound infiltrating and inspiring the gathering of what feels like lustful decisions
taken with no reason
-all the artistry in our poor human decisions!-
* the reasons behind this still fascinating the minds of those scientists called losers * 
-We all have to feel how it is to lose at some point in our lives, he declared.
-Life never forgives a man
as death never ceased to chase a unicorn. 
.
The Glass Tear’s been taken away from the work, original. 
A place for a tear like this one, please!
On the face of a mannequin?
On the walls of a friendly room? 
caught in the frame
of a love lost 
but
to be found
one day
asking for its wings back 
to gather and reflect 
emotions of in-congruent meanings. 
A tear of glass depicting life as it is. 
* unsatisfied a thing *
The one of paint is changing everything. 
 *
- That happened, the nightmare of last night! It’s over now! 
Why are you so upset and sad?
- Because... 
- You haven’t told me enough about your bad decisions in life!
- Perhaps some other time, kid! Some other time!
A good soul, He was, broken by the loss of those good times of youth
he could have lived for just a bit longer. 
To make him proud the child brought him only the best proves of love and respect
towards the mother they lost, the wife,
 the present taken away from early youth; 
She, as the phantom, kept walking along by their side, 
flying along the moment they took a car for a place that he spoke of as nowhere to be heading for! 
.
For the grace of the Lord and the fake saint who happened to understand how to hurt both of you! 
*
Jump! 
Jump off the building! 
You’re only a phantom, not a real thing! 
Jump!
* 
He is a good soul, not broken anymore, she did what she had to do. 
The phantom’s chasing healers made him forget all the pain. 
.
She is a good soul! A tear sparkling out as a miracle on her face, 
both broken a long time ago, 
defeated by death, defying the laws of gravity,
 both knowing how to deal with the pain, 
how to play and how to put an end to the game. 
.
A dream of tremendous power, put to sleep, 
waking-up the dead if needed! 
The glass of the tear greeting and meeting your souls
can cut quite wide openly. 
.
A dream of a tear that caught light from a sun shining bright.
In a tear of rage and sorrow, 
merciless hollow times
spoken they were, 
spitted out venom they offered
time after time.
The venom some of you offered was fine. 
A refined tear of paint: Come! 
Let us fly away from here! 
I’ll cut, if I must, 
You’ll heal with your lust for life!
.
The Glass Tear has spoken it’s colours, shapes and wings
out of the tunnel
of all hopes and dreams once broken. 
A glass tear and a foil of abstract paint. 
On eleven corners of gratitude, they fly.

Hell-Ping: The One
 .
Technical values of learning about the real world we live in; 
A prism I was so certain about, you can have a clue on the reality of a part
well played.
You either chose to belong or ignore
your inner-self’s call,
Your mind’s carving
Your spirit’s craving, 
You sit and observe, 
silently watching the stars burn, 
following your beautiful principles, 
the education and values of your home! 
You’ll always treasure
the work of your home 
done for you! 
*
I’m only a child loving the honey, sweet, 
the perfumes sweetness of the home that I was raised in
brought by the blessed bees of the kingdom.
A
Victorian story haunting our souls: 
- ...for how much longer, for how long? 
*
- I don’t want to be part of this haunt anymore! 
I do understand that this is all over and that I should simply move on with my life; 
There is no other curse to follow than the one of the right thing to do, 
the responsibility of your actions taken in the name of the fool that I was. 
.
-I won’t believe in your aliens again! a response.
I want to believe in that someone who was fair the very moment they saw you and your potential, 
The very moment they knew that playing with fire was not a good thing
bringing any power to the world we live in.
-If the ways you are playing it 
do the right thing for you and your kings... 
.
Crazy in love with the idea of a love lost forever since the rules of society have spoken: Eternal Tears of Sorrow they bring to a good heart 
but all that seemed to all of you to be The Perfect Right! 
Yes! If ‘tears’ is what you make happen and bring into the world then tears is what you’ll get,
So help us god! 
..
“Through actions and faithful cries on which you keep believing that this better world creates itself, 
a better life created: 
HELP! 
(aren’t we all hilarious to you)
(there’s something more to do)
(You stop my mission you... -a smile showing regret, despise, disgust-...pay!)
..
All these are my cries to you! 
What do you want now?

Victorian stories, all left behind,
all remembered
to carry the stone that’s become 
lighter and lighter.

Your heart will be released from that heavy burden you’re carrying 
For no one.

“We’re trying to save you but people don’t react the way they want! 
The ways they love, the ways of their prides! 
I want all the stupid prides crushed and broken now! 
I want my stupid ones to win!”

Your faith showing desperation, 
Hers showing that there’s something to do
about the preservation of the order of things.
Not having the courage to do the right thing!
.
She will, Oh he will! 
One Victorian story in which things will happen
quite the way they feel. 
..
“Let them be! 
Let them be! 
Their times of eternal happiness will bring back those peaceful times of happiness and glorious love 
You want!” 
..
- He, he! That’s never to happen! That isn’t real here! 
They slaughter and murder everything that’s good in the name of their lord! 
In the name of their cash-flow! 
In the name of God! 
In the name of whatever you want!

An industrial revolution, on misery based
Horizons that we imagine, 
projecting in our dreams the planned and well-dressed corrections 
of right and righteous things,
reflecting and protecting, 
reflecting upon your worlds, so true,
the inspiration needed, 
the times of action too. 
Constructiveness
(of choices) 
Queen of all money, true,
Real visions, you’d like broken 
On tears of hearts that broke
all rules!
.
*to get all that they want -you want- no matter who plays what, 
a sacrifice that’s needed: 
for that’s only an object not your entire heart!*
*
One tear will be sufficient 
from one heart that can heal, 
One wish from our heroes, 
a prayer, a gesture, 
be it cruel, 
One sign of mercy, true!
One for a loving father, 
One for the mother too. 
.
A sign got from the holy 
Not from your mountain dew. 
A sign received from mercy, 
Not from your lying truths. 
..
If irony is helpful, then irony will do,
just walk me through, settle the dew on the palm of a leaf alive. 
That’s all I have to say right now to all of you, miraculous talking flies!

A Bee-fly, a Bee-Dragon-Fly, 
a Bee-AntIque-fly
I am
in your eye.  
A saviour in all of us, 
A type of Christ revealed!

the credits for his own work - my work somehow too!?

The Amusing Child of Sorrow
. 
Never cry, never cry, 
An obsession for a heart that’s too hard and too strong 
for you to carry on with. 
.
How could I lose it, 
how could I? 
How!? 
.
Oh, child, That doesn’t matter anymore,
it happened too long a time ago,
It was taken away from you so you find your ways. 
It was taken away so you break the walls and paint something ...horrible. 
.
- We need pain, we need nightmares, we need sorrows! 
We want to share with you the same old spirit. 
.
- Of course, you do! Of course! 
Never ask for what you cannot handle things well with. 
Seriousness

It’s pouring golden lines and silver issues emerge speaking about how to keep yourself healthy as a rock - and carve your history painting on a stone that works too for someone too little for a cliff to even take a look-down to. Cliff! This guy used to be a miracle in the eyes of anyone meeting him. Now he’s just a wreck, a memory, sad, of the big deal he used to be. - Cliff, darling, I remember his wife belling around! Will you get the door? - Where’s Rupert? - He’s been dismissed. He has a family reunion once a year, remember? - Ah! Yes! - Well? Aren’t you curious who wants to keep us company today?
A big deal he was, this Cliff-man. A big shot, a friend of his used to say. ‘The man’ and ‘Cliff-man’ the jokers in town at each party thrown. Really something, the silverware we were made to have our fancy cuisine served.

Make things better now! It is you the all-powerful!
Isn’t it all about a collaboration!?
Wasn’t it meant for me to learn? 
She is learning how to help, 
She is learning how to ...
how to...
how to...
.
Just admit that you never wanted to help her but push her to the limits 
and break her! 
Didn’t she confess!? 
Shouldn’t we all confess
about the beautiful lives we lived, imagined, dreamed of;
Since we all read about things in books! 
If you want to know! 
You need to relax and learn about what you want to use for your creation elsewhere!

A strike of Endlessness
.
Where are my pills so I can overdose? 
A strike of endless serotonin and I’m out of this place in my mind
that’s too troubled to accept and like! 
Some call this a state of mind
...
whose mind is only for you and I to decide 
and think about or not, 
Someone else would have spoken to me about the state of a case;
Someone tried once to write something about such a poem hidden somewhere! 
A book-case I prepared for a drive back home, 
the home of my spirit, the one of my soul, 
(why are you weeping?) 
On a wall’s mortar and paint progress was over and over again
refurbished, renewed: 
A work of art they asked for and re-paid
for keeping stable. 
.
Hoarse sounds of wild decisions,
instinctual moves and movement 
based on good thinking. 
The R’s and the V’s,
serotonin levels too high! 
A must would now be to take them all down. 
Where are my pills?

“I can see where you’re going! You’re trying to make a monster of me! “
Last night a shining bright light came from you. The rays of light you generated passed through the thick, red-wine, royal curtain like spears of hopes and dreams attacking the illness and healing the soul. Your path to the knowledge of a wonderful life was drawn a long time before you realised it happening; mine is still a little doomed to this waste from which I keep hoping for a spirit - kind enough to resurrect me and my self-awareness so I helped myself bring back to life  the importance of such a sacrifice as the one of losing yourself -  being able to deal with this almost childish painful sentiment of failure that’s constantly making others seem happier; I loved being blind to my own emotions and connected to what seemed to be other peoples’ happiness. I hoped for more strength to deal with it though. In the end, it is the only thing that’s worth feeling - when found in such a situation: joy for other peoples’ joy and happiness ..to feed with. 
* 
You were watching our ignorant sleep last night; watching for our good wishes to come true in terms of a reality that we’ll have to accept as our choice even if we feel that it wasn’t quite so! Well, It wasn’t ... But we have chosen to be part of it as much as we could.
- Where are you, my loveless star! The loveliest star of all!? he asked as I was watching over one sleep of two entities long lost and forgotten by someone who simply couldn’t take it anymore. How could I judge that someone now? How!?
Last night the star shone brightly above us all. It was the best start of a morning for the star. 
*
Running towards the future with the angels in a dream, 
not being aware of all the grenades filling the fields
 off, I take off, getting myself to pay 
for something that you do not know in what amounts to count and number,
naming among those stars of the wonder you are - you learn. 
inspired by the spirit of the Angels of Mercy,
guided by the spirit of Love.

“I come from a history of people fighting for all the wrong reasons to make (appear to be) right; in front of their people, all the shiny armours and outfits adored, items of clothing for which many would have killed as many have learned enough from so they did it.
 I come from a history of people feeling either too good or too bad about themselves, a place where a day of rebellion can cost more than a thousand wars, if properly done a slaughter! I come from that history in which feelings meant much more than we tend to appreciate they do now; feeling angry and disappointed again at the innocent people you keep thinking you are. You really are! (Innocent, that is... as clear as whistled a statement.) 
I’m here, feeling dropped down by a history book that’s found ways of haunting all of us through the pages of  many variations of the term describing romance and the entire meaning of the terms that Romantic Ages can describe, finding my peace and equilibrium in every aspect of the ways we danced this dance:  “we all danced”! 
- Would you like to see my spears? Would you love to watch the wounds that our witches and wizards have healed so many times before so you had your nice little stories written for your better luxurious lives to live with no pain and troubles taken? Would you like to see the real sacrifices made in the name of a God who had enough mercy to give us permission to rest our restless souls, our restless minds and use the spirit for another cause of justice smashed and thrown into the air with the despair of someone showing to us how she felt, how you felt, how we all feel when deceived by what we acknowledged as our duty and the faith we must lead our lives with. 
I come from that history of people who won’t hear us anymore! Who won’t kill us because we can frighten them with our strong call to action. I’d rather fraternize with the Demon Girl you keep throwing your hard rocks at! She’ll find her stones and pebbles to cover you up with! She’ll move some mountains! She’ll support your causes! She loved you too. She fought for the same values and principles you’re using against the weak! -Oh! I’d feel such honour to be like thee! he spoke loudly and spit! A man is not the one who attacks a woman but the one who can protect her from getting harmed!

In the world of ideas 
hard rocks can be moved fast
with the ease and candour of all the children
having confidence in the love of God.

Shown in the sunshine, shown by the clouds, shown into the skies 
by armies of swallows and pigeons, crows and ravens, 
hawks and herons, little humming-birds and robins... and vultures! 
- I’ll never forget about your vultures - 
spoke an eagle heart
shown by the rain and the smell of fresh poisons
to kill all the rats. 
Washed down all the toxic events of the past, 
they find mercy and rescued they are by the evil-man’s crushed thoughts 
of mass destruction.

“The great thick walls of that imposing fortress school have spoken to her more than any nice word could have done, showing the prestige and honouring traditions, the valuable knowledge behind their shielded by perfectionism medieval polish, blessed by the Lord with thousands of years of progress in a hub, cherished and restored a beauty every time a need of such kind was imposed.  So, she’s chosen a place to have some rest and feed her soul with the potent nature and the beauty in the human spirituality found in the finest of expressions of arts; her mind fresh to begin believing the impossible was quite possible, we see her confident once more on the streets of European cities and villages, befriending people and doing something nice together before a nice show in the capital. Those nice people have no clue about who she is though: that good a make-up! That good a costume! That brilliant a variation and a show! (the impossible good, to be clear, for a change of perspective... right?).

Demon Girl, what have you done!? 
How could you fly so high
and leave us all alone? 
Oh, Demon Girl,
What is that you’ve been searching for!? 
Who gave you the rights to argue with the angels of all gods on Earth? 
.
Demon Girl! Why didn’t you turn all their world upside-down,
just like before!
Oh, Demon Girl, what’s preventing you for telling your demonizing-story 
once more!?
How could you expect so much love in return
for the favor of not knowing it all! 
For the favor-out of offering tears and praying for some hearts to be healed! 
Oh, Demon Girl! 
How could you believe in justice for all!? 
Dear, Demon Girl! 
be rescued by the Love of God 
and the Mercy of Heavens Above!

- I felt pleasantly haunted, last night, by a spirit guiding me through the halls of the right wing, he confessed to his friend. 
- Haunted?! Really?! ...
- Yes, ... she’s been guiding me through all the corridors and rooms, taking me to the libraries I needed to get to, showing me the books to read and search for; so I found all the information needed for my papers. 
- She...?! ... I believe that you need a girl-friend! his friend spoke heartily. 
- No, I don’t! ... You know, she’s been also inspiring me some theses and I’ve got some titles out of nowhere afterwards... you know, for our sciences of living literature classes! 
- Hah!... funny you should mention Lucy! She’s quite a character around here! the friend was heard speaking. 
- Lucy!? I didn’t...
As he lifted-up his head he could see that his thoughts expressed were no longer of interest to the hooked on reality guys sharing jokes and talking about the Shows of Lucy, one local star bringing all sort of sparkling notes of happiness that looked beautifully enchanting from the right distances to measure things up and down - just like a tailor, brave and most wonderful.  
*
Lucy came to brighten-up your days, 
bringing faithful charms to you, 
you kept ignoring the stairs of amber
she build with the charms of the enchanting diamond rings
she’s never accepted or worn. 
.
Lucy came bright and brilliant like an angel of love,
not caring about what you might understand of this term. 
She had no clue about your intentions
but she could feel the dangers and her protections stopped you
from hurting her. 
She’ll always be protected by her merciless angels. 
With Pride.

“How could I offend you so hard, my God! How could I offend myself with the wrath of these times that won’t accept us as part of the world unless we lower our heads and our selves to their levels of judgement and behaviour!?” 
..
Oh, Demon Girl! What have you done!?!
..
- You are the most beautiful presence in the world, now, but - you see - I was awake when I saw who did what and why and for what! Who lived intensely every single moment of beauty, who burned so many wishes of kindness and innovation inside so somebody else lived them happily; a stupid custom imposed by a stupid ignorant people: the people of that kind I do not wish to meet again! (earthly a gathering, your people, not having to do with a nation of any fools. - May I go on being a fool? she asked.) 
Her eyes met the hatred in his soul and then she understood that her dream-life was over. 
*
“I want them to feel terror! 
I want them to feel fright! 
I want them to shudder before me and behind my back,
 for all the wrath I felt - because of them - I’ll leave you all behind.”
*
“Now how to break a spell so wonderful and great!? 
- Use the power of your brains! 
-Use your will! 
- One needs the strongest will and the sharpest mind to continue with this hard time offered with such lust for life and destruction of anything that might have meant happiness in those heavens not needing this at all! 
- Yes, Shyng, do! 
- Thank you, sir! 
- You too! 
*
I’m sorry to have hurt you! 
If you needed some time alone
You had it
only couldn’t make much of it 
the very moment you should have done things
right.

“Place me there where I can cry for my greatest guilt, for my shames, for the grace of God! For my own grace and the one of the angels: place me there where I can pay for my mistakes, for all my sins, forever.” 
“Place me there where I can learn about what’s fine and what is better.”

 “I don’t want another girl! I don’t want to be mature enough for something else, just like our parents try to make us think! We’re not the Kings and the Queens of Old England anymore! I want us out of the troubles caused! They’re history now, we’re funny enough already speaking about how things affect the world that’s not affected by this anymore and we are done! We are done with those times! Let us bury them into the grounds of all books and burn them on the screens and stages, shoot them everywhere our sets and sites can shoot a star like that, flaming the past  for a future never to harm us again!  
So, no! Don’t harm me with your wisdom and your knowledge and don’t heal me of the love I want to feel! They can all scream and shout and yell back at the ways we feel! I want to take away whatever they hold dear to! Let’s see if they’ll be the same after the damage’s applied to them! 
No! Never try to heal me again from a sentiment of justice and love! Kindness and respect for what’s kind and beautiful!  
*
I know you! I know you as I know Myself,
You’re dangerous and harmful 
but healing a presence and Just a sorrow
to take
for a cry-out! 
In despair, for our solitude we pray, 
without knowing 
that this is where we’ll lead 
our people to.
In solitude we learn about the work of the Great and Greater than us
doing as our heart asks us to
For an escape from the solitude
we no longer hold dear sentiment for.
In companionship we search for a guide 
and guidance is in ourselves
when we choose 
someone to show us around!
Back to solitude, now, 
The solitude of three or four, 
it’s five sometimes, 
sometimes a little more: 
Those family issues we need to keep away from all danger. 
 ..
Fighting against my nightmares, my own fears and troubling issues
trying not to become a monstrous being, 
not knowing my potential and what I was meant to become.
I’m still filled with anger towards the wasted years of behaving like an angel of God, 
It seems to me that the people of God themselves want me out.
Perhaps I am mistaken, perhaps am funny too, 
You will never know because you don’t believe in me, 
You don’t know what love is, you never wanted to deserve it. 
Love was perhaps one answer,
hatred is one too.

“Are these sensations and feelings uniting us in blue-times, red-times - black! Fading away, becoming white stalking angels looking for the colours of the bright-gold ...  will never know unless we start looking for; - are they left behind, immense sensations of time and space expanding!? It’s all an illusion yet it becomes reality the moment we step into the buildings and gardens hosting their knowledge, the worlds proposed in the books we write, telling about what’s left of us... what’s wanted resurrected and passed on to the generations to follow.  Are these sensations real? They are just like the hunger for... the knowledge of... the lack of knowledge I feared so! Intensity of thunderous decisions we can only use the ways we’re capable of conceiving living as imagined the brightness of all matters of the living - inspired by the dead and wishing to protect... their kindness, real, still standing-up for something meaningful, as we speak, or write or paint... as we sing or play... a choice of interpretation of our collective feelings.

“After losing her father, the pretty little girl needed a long-time recovery. It was only them for a while and everything happened quite unexpectedly. She had nobody but him; she never knew her mother; alone, in the darkness of the room she cried until her sobbing faded noisily into the silence of an exhausted sleep. It was not only losing her only support. It was losing all of their dreams, together; all her dreams on how to make him proud one day - proud of being her father. Proud of being who he became to her - a mentor, a guide, an example to take... a hero. The only thing that kept her alive was a word said once by a thoughtful old lady and the presence of an enlightened spirit in which she could recognize her father’s loving warmth of soul; guiding her and asking her to go on and make him proud like she always used to so that, when they met in the afterlife they had something more to chat and laugh about.”
..
- God! Last night, in a dream, I cried like a baby! The other night we wept like children on a playground getting hurt by the majestic children who were trained more for a fist in a stomach, perhaps well deserved, than for a word filled with the wisdom we didn’t know or left behind for the poor to deal with! 
Last night I wept like a star: only arrows down to illuminate your sorrow-land for you to make a stand for a journey or to walk through this morning with pride. 
Last night I wasn’t aware of the dangers inside a woman’s heart! She almost slayed mine but I feel alright. She’s healed me from the sentiment of loser-ship... and from the one of real friendship. Last night the end happened and I felt cursed, just like before, the same ways getting it worse... a saint hated us for something he was deprived of... a saint taught her a lesson on how not to believe in any angel of God... in any angel of goodness and kindness in the world - the saint will  fix things, do not be too worried! The saint didn’t mean to do any harm to the world of the worthiest children of this almost round palace that’s still entitled to wear the name Earth.

- I must have messed with some natural orders and most certainly some prides got affected, the science-mind voice in his head spoke. Egos beyond my power of acceptance and understanding  got unleashed like demons kept in a cave for long enough a time to make them thirsty for chaos, destruction and war, once again. 
*
God, Help me!
Help us all! 
she yelled back at the skies
but the skies responded with lyrics in a song that wouldn’t offer the help but the stones to hit her in the face
if not trained how to defend. 
- 
Duck! Hide! Shield Yourself, Girl!
Hide and never come back to show us your pride and beauty!

Back in Cambridge, they kept learning under the guidance of their teachers as well as under the possession of that spirit knowing whom to guide where and what for to take an action of passing through the labyrinths of book-shops, libraries, saloons of science and literature, laboratories, cafés and gardens... -police departments of the entire palace got moved by the nothingness of a heart broken a long long time ago - it doesn’t matter for her, anymore. You can say and do whatever you want. She’s been too much of a fighter, back then in those times when she was given many reasons to put an end to it all... Stupid enough a thing not to do so; now she must live the stupid decision of keeping her face up into the winds of sorrow(less) active-despair with a smile, well imprinted on her face, so to bother you once more - just because it hurt! No better reason than this one!

“One day I’ll take you to the attic!” she made a promise to the young writer. “And another day will guide you to somewhere nice, a different place where they’ll make ou feel small but never trust them and take those words for sure! You should keep yourself away from their mighty wrath! Nevertheless, if good a heart there will be always an angel to the rescue! So have no fear! Just be aware of all dangers.They’re demons. They are limited to harming the good children of our planet as well as the bad guys. Don’t let yourself defeated by them. Have faith! Don’t sell your soul to the devil... and if you did so, by mistake or The Mightiest Divine Entity of the Universe might know how, please, consider me as the devil to get you out of there somehow... You’ll be feeling all powerful... and you’ll start thinking that it is yourself the one who did it; you’ll think you did it all by yourself... the power of your mind, rules, the one of your heart leads (perhaps the roles will change; then the heart will take the lead and will rule... the mind will subject itself to the values they’ll accept as their own and you’ll become their leader, their star.) I’m speaking nice words to you, right now, full of the remnants of a dangerous filth from which all of us had to rise at a certain moment in time. You’ll get yourself out of that sadness, young writer, heart of a poet... stupid rules breaker... bringer of Faith back into the hearts that keep asking for it, even if sometimes too strong an army of demons to put down. Be proud to be this kind of stupid and not the other way around! - the too proud of not searching for an answer, not studying, not trying. 
.
“One day I’ll take you somewhere nice and different a place so you can see how life and the world will evolve with you, to see how it would have been shaped without you and how it could have been if you met
either the lie of your lifetime
or the truth of all times!
. 
Locked in a crystal ball until all dangers pass; 
I’ll break it when the right time comes. 
Until then you write and dance and do what you have to do. 
I’ will come back to see you.

She must have hated me a lot, your lady! 
She must have had a reason too; 
forget-me-not!

how I ended-up damaging your family 
tree.

“She tried her best, I supported her in all her quest of helping you move away.
So, what kind of punishment should I expect now for not forgetting how to relive
a past that was sweeter than the one implied by your awful lies telling us all that your life was sweet 
when it wasn’t!? 
She did try her best and I helped! 
Things got out of my hand. 
You punished me severely
for my shameless acts of treason, 
for my awful prides
taken on the valuables stolen from your people, 
from your hearts
the symbols standing for love.

Try, my shy eagle, he doesn’t care if you get in trouble, 
abused and amused by this kind of a kid spoiled by the family,
 happy to see
that he can rise above anything and anyone
since he’s brilliant enough. 
He wouldn’t take another guess, a second try... 
he had enough of this charade. 
In moods for another one, kind. 
He doesn’t care and doesn’t look for any truth;
 he’d simply embrace his own cold belief
in what he knows and feels! 
belief in the highest levels of a spirit 
that’s lost all feeling.

Think why! 
See why! 
Feel why!
if you want!

Those things that I learned about seem distant in time, 
So calmly I’m watching the sunrise in our practice hall. 
I’m going down for a cup of coffee, 
a tea-drop would be nice! After all! I came an hour and a half earlier to practice some more! 
.
Calmly going down to see how they fit, those pictures of ours on the panel. 
The team is complete; I’m somewhere around here... I don’t even look as a dancer among them! 
Although they keep admiring some of my poses and the muscles, they say, look pretty enough for a dancer like me,
one on the levels everyone around here seems to remember as best. 
How can this be? Are they lying to me? 
(Just look into the mirrors and see! You will see!) 
- If you’ll like yourself more, you’ll be there, where you want! she spoke to herself as if trying to get convinced of the truth carried by those words. 
.

Don’t! Don’t! 
Heads up! Vision high! 
Don’t just stand there! 
Work with your arms! 
Pliez! Pliez!

Work again!
Work with your arms!

Forced into an outrageous marriage,

For all the mothers and fathers who knew how to care! 
For all the teachers wanting a better world to which they’d participate! 
To all the students crossing the roads for something beautiful instead of the ugliest pain.

For all the circles we gather, for a gentle touch of a finger remembering a dear one; 
a sentiment to heal a wounded soul with, 
a spirit to carry on with the knowledge of our world
that should be beautiful.

The amazing writers’ dream: 
The best of our times; 
the ones coming back to us,
 round and round, projected up there where we always believed we belonged: 
Down there, where we can have a hell of a wonderful time! 
The best of our times: 
The ones coming back to take us to when and where we feel that we can do anything! 
.
A place where repercussions for observing and investing in yourself are only allowed to be done well;
 where passions can replace passions and reinvest in yourself,
where training and the personal typing ends-up getting back or stealing 
from photographs and shows on stages and screens,
lost for a moment, quickly regained love-addicts
&
*the potions you sell!*
*God, those potions you sell!*
finding life in the essence of life itself;
 your souls ask for forgiveness, 
for Love was much to blind to see it all, 
embrace it all with no fear and no doubts at all. 
.
To see that I was hurtful, you were the same to me, 
to someone else, to other times, perhaps;
My present is the best one now,
 a gift I can’t forget: a painting imagined as fine and refined as I was allowed to think of; 
an aspiration for what’s love become to you all;
A lie to the future, a lie to your soul.
My present is the best one, offering things left behind
by those who knew just how to take the helping great love’s hand.

The teacher’s room
.
By the old drawing table a box’s being held, 
one holding the papers of a scientist’s lair, 
a secret chanson is sang right to him, 
he is using his mind to find our sonnet lumière.
As a charming story is being danced down below, 
in the chamber of mirrors for girls to learn how to be adored
the secret chanson is offered as a helping hand
to the greatest lovers of them all. 
They knew each-other in one life, one life tares them apart, 
they find themselves together again, together they die. 
= 
One time to be apart they had, back then, in a certain book 
that Marie was explaining to well to her kids. 
One time to be apart, 
as if forever this felt, 
then suddenly a poem - the place where their souls are getting saved. 
Now, nothing harms their love for one another as it had never did; 
their hearts put to the shelter of the tears of someone sweet 
enough to care. 
Now nothing can harm them since they are both blessed now, both blessed 
by a god that’s been fighting and crying for them. 
In a poem they met, in a story, in a song - in the nature of flowers and the rumours of fun;
a place where nothing can harm them since they are

.
The kind of a king, he was the chosen one, 
creating monsters of the newest type of fools, 
losers and winners exposed on television 
under bizarre shapes, wearing strange forms
of expression: - what could be the meaning of all that, to the creator him or herself?
(everybody loses something at some point in life, dear!)

A funny salad story, exposed on a new screen
I’m tired of staring at so, I’m minding my own businesses and crazy dreams.

“Give me the power, give me the strength to get up and fight for myself and my kid!
Please, Lord, I know that my mistakes were real, 
I want to know about redemption, I want to know about how it feels to be loved for real, 
.
to be respected and cared for, 
to be able to feel at peace with the work that I do, In the nave of your garden:
- Out! Out! Out! Out of my garden you awful traitor! Out!
.
The serpent, upset with his god and himself, left the place to be venomous and respected somewhere else.

Sweet interpretation of the ways I fight,
The ways that I use,
The ways that I made you all cry
for nothing, something good,
something beautiful,
something perfumed.

What kind of a doctor, what kind of a fool?

This novel is only at the point of asking questions so I’d know where to begin telling a story I hoped untold; 
I discovered a little earlier that it was already famous and very well known! 
.
His students sick, his patients weak and weary come to him seeking for the cure, 
-properly wired to be for a duty-
revenge taken against the mighty revengeful nature 
of human fights and fears; 
of human weaknesses in front of their own needs.
.
“How could I be this stupid and not give it a try!? 
but tried to commit murder 
instead of a pathetic suicide?!” 
The teenager is playing, his acting seems quite real, 
as mom and dad are watching 
their favourite night show, his brother a cartoon,
all three of them tired of their own reality
imposing rule after rule.
/To follow\ 
.
In such terms, spoken a little earlier in this show of a night, 
we end this theme in a terrible disappointment hoping for a lullaby. 
He is certainly right, for once in his lifetime spent with her, the woman; 
quite a surprise, this gift of mine: 
- Where did this come from? 
.
“How could I be so stupid and return to this!? 
How could I be this weak?! 
Not knowing how to pretend and how to put an end to this awful charade! 
This story is not for me! 
How to start, where to end?
How to...
humble and proud around
moving and asking myself: 
How could I...!?”

Blindly leaving words behind their lovely and graceful flight,
their loveliest wrath, their honest personal truths, 
Their wishes, their commands,
They will all be fought.
So win!

Storm manager, in time you’ll find the truth about yourself and what was possible; 
With all that help they offered to you, my dear, so true!
How could you still believe in me, myself or them to save or lose you? 
Still blind to all the knowledge to kill what’s to be killed, 
still blind to what you hated for no choice ever offered
in time to save your will, 
you beautiful good will!  
You save us all now, honey, if that’s what you wanted to do! 
You save us if you wanted us all doomed!

Blind and beautiful illusions 
flying above us all 
showing their graceful lovable wings in the light of day,
glowing in the darkness of the night
raining down on us their feathers of bright black and white 
memories.

My father was the greatest wizard of all, 
not the kind that would kill a human heart over and over again, 
not the one fighting crimes that never happened,
that never hurt anyone,
not fighting the innocent
but the poor in spirit, the poor in soul,
not loving and protecting
the heart of gold. 
My father fought, along with all the warriors, 
a warrior himself he was
at times,
He fought all evil, 
against their evil thoughts, he was... 
His black magic was never applied to anyone 
but those who couldn’t deal with love of the true and wonderful kind. 
But there are boundaries, you!
Know!
Not anyone can go through darkness coming out like a shining beautiful heart! 
Not all of us keep ourselves intact! 
Some fall into the abyss of their thoughtful shells, too dark. 
.
My father was the greatest wizard of all! 
He is the doctor of my soul!
A god among his kind of people!

  “It’s not about having fun but about trying to live a life in the most arrogant way of living it and that is trying to look as if everything is going perfectly well even when it isn’t, showing attitudes and outfits that reflect the joy that’s been taken away for the duty fell on the heads of those who didn’t have the power given by money to accomplish something pretty hard to accomplish, given the circumstances. But circumstances change and people ... well, they tend to change too, accordingly; nevertheless, the essence of who we are remains and deep down inside we’ll keep being who we always were, improving everything that we kept close to our hearts or in the secret chambers of our treasures-storage personal spaces. Weapons to kill or to exhibit, to use in a fictive or a real battle, messages to revive and send over mountains and seas and hills; Love letters to kill or lit candles in hearts that keep needing to be warmed and chilled by something. A pile of parts-studies, albums of art and books keeping knowledge away from the burning light damaging the support on which they got imprinted. Sometimes the human brain reacts the same as a piece of paper or canvas or some other material when exposed to Times’ and Spaces’ weather transitions. 
Time, coming from the human thoughtful interpretation of repetition in perpetual existential motion; Space, something that’s given, acknowledged and fought for in tries to manifest some dominance. Sometimes, this brain of the human controlling as much as it can doesn’t know how to react to corrosive poisonous snakes.... and sometimes it does; and when it does.... oh, when it does then... all the tears in the world burn and wash away the toxin, making-up a new medicine. Oh, the candles! Oh, the storms of thoughts and whispering feelings not wanting to show-off and speak-up! Oh, the dangers of the spears and daggers that can be used to stab us in the back! Uh! This ugly corrosive hideous paranoid mind! 
- But it’s here, it is happening right next to you, right near you! Can’t you see? How can you speak of any paranoia when things are just showing to be real to you?

(Living the paranoia dream! I’m frightened by your love now, dear! - cold bright fright and blaze...- not going to ignore the door-bell this time!)

- Out of hell! Go up there and meet those you always loved and cherished, those you cried for! (he started cutting the ropes on her wounded wrists.) Many they were, I must confess that I didn’t expect this! Nobody did! (as he moves around to grab something from an old barrel used as a stool she turns around not knowing how to respond to what’s taken her by surprise.) There, there! Cut the tears for me too. (he lifts his eyes). Oh, good, you weren’t crying for never seeing such an ugly chap again! Good! He, he... Here, take this jacket and this pair of shoes; they’re new. They’ll keep you warm through the dungeons of the castle and the iced lands of Karuchhrfaw. 
- Ka...
- Sounds like a place I’ve invented, doesn’t it!? He he! See!? You’re not the only one who can invent stuff! ... No, but coming back on some grounds of reason, if I may speak of such things around here... This place actually exists only some name it differently, that’s all. It’s a whole new planet for you, I know, but once you’ve gotten yourself out of here, you’re free to go anywhere you want... We do have some green things around here too... only they are far far away! And you’ll no longer fly on the back of any giant dragon-flies to see those places! You’ll have to walk for the wonderful treats! Around here good stuff comes with sacrifice and hard times ... well, you know it! It’s not like you had the time to forget about the whole thing already! I mean, look at you! You’re still here, looking at me, listening to what I say as if you didn’t get it! You’re free. Free to explore our wilderness. Go! And have fun! 
- ... yes... right... fun...( she made a few steps away then stopped remembering that being rude was not in her nature so she turned around to say: ... Thank you!  and so she did - but the man was no longer there. He vanished with the sound of keys and crickets saying goodbye to the coldest cell of the dungeons of hell.

Karl and his idea of freedom 

  This love-story was my heart and soul. I wrote it when I was in my first year of high-school. It was, of course, inspired by a girl whose face is still haunting me. I used to know her in a dream, I used to think about how I’d meet her and how I’d speak with her but every time I could see her alone, on the halls of our high-school I felt either confused or embarrassed about the stupid lines not sounding right. It was then when I realized that I was no relationship material but one of those solitary guys who should just mind their businesses. Mine is writing and being curious about the ways things work without getting too involved into life matters. I’m an expert on that! Everyone says so and I tend to agree with them. It is not that I didn’t give it a try but ... people give me the freaks! That’s how I ended-up fixing everybody with their best partner. Many still get along well, a lot of them  got married and have children and only two couples divorced but kept their relationship in good terms. So, I’m very good at making people find each other and get involved but lousy a boy when thinking seriously about making the brilliant move for myself. 
  So, I prefer writing my stories on which, I hope one day, I’ll get to feed my entire being with. I also hope that I’m going to make some real money and get out of poverty. Oh! Haven’t I mentioned it to you? We’re poor, me and my mother; unfortunately, you’d say with that distant cold empathetic pity which makes the sarcasms of life bring-up the sweetness in the irony of existentialism.  We live with bread, some flowers and weeds that I and my mother pick-up each Sunday during the church services. Sometimes berries and fruit of the trees that are nobodies’ to claim a seed and care-taking! It is done then, the picking and placing in baskets, when people cannot see us doing so, because they’re in church, busy singing praises to the lord and the saints trapped there to listen to them false a note or two or shine their glorious voices through (I sure hope they had enough food before their efforts of making their beautiful songs heart all the way up to the hills and valleys, the poor things!) while the old chattier gals’ in the corner-fun one start the analysis everyone’s dress, attitude, hairs. The truth is, I envy them. Sometimes we go to church to. I hear about my mother’s poor taste in using the same old-fashioned clothes released by the House of Style about five years ago -”That’s ages ago, style!” (Well, please know that it is immortal, she was smart enough knowing what to buy for herself, being sure what fits her and what doesn’t. Many have no clue, they just go with the fashion looking like idiots who happen to have enough money to afford to mock themselves horribly this way, not paying attention on the cracks of glasses and windows they provoked as they passed them by.) Anyway, we’re usually ‘hunting’ or ‘fishing’ for our food. This way we avoid some mockery, mom says. At least that. I had enough with mockery of all sorts of taste and colour! 
  Speaking of mockery and remembering my old love-story written; a friend claimed that she was the one who wrote it. I don’t know what on earth possessed me to show it to her - it seems that some souls never change, do they!? A thief-heart is still a thief-heart, isn’t it?  So, she claimed it was her story, I got informed by a rival of mine whose decency in not letting me swim in complete ignorance of the fact that I’m being screwed - allowing me to be aware of what’s going on around and behind my back - is to be appreciated. Poor friend, this amazing creature screwing me! Always dressed with the most expensive clothes this little city’s got to offer, always among the popular, always getting the attention she needs... She’s smart and funny sometimes but if her expensive clothing wouldn’t say something more about her than she really is, the gangs would be far-far away from knowing her. Not that bright of a creature, I believe. 
  So, I felt like hating her for a while, for stealing my work, of course; it was about my soul, you know it, I spoke in confidence earlier to you... I still have a few regrets showing it to her and asking for an opinion! Stupid me! I must have had a moment of weakness. Now everybody thinks that she is the brilliant one! She copied it and changed a few things, using her own hand and teachers made a star out of her. I hated her guts! I hated her from the bottom of my testicles combined with the one poured into my blood vessels from my myocardium’ s strength which is kind of awesome! All doctors were amazed. And all of them will be amazed when the bitch will get what she deserves. But there will be time for revenge. There’s time to take it back at her. Meanwhile I’ll just mind my own business. I have a new story on the roll which is actually a thousand times better. I’ll make her cry her entire mistake, her soul and heart, her blood and her spit in the eye back then when she dared to piss on my work with her pesky little scratches of ‘personal corrections’ and place her grotesque paw-like signature on! I’ll get it published, this new and brilliant one, and then I am going to salute her from the heights of my success, saying “Goodbye” forever! (and as to myself only to her I’d add: “Cunt!” in a lower tone - I’m much to well raised and respect my mother’s struggle too much to speak this one out-loud. But I’m honest enough too, so I admit that this is how I feel towards her guts at the moments which are supposed to be the present! How would you feel if you were in my shoes? Just asking a rhetorical question. No need for you to place a light upon this one!)
  I hate thieves! I hate abusers! And I hate myself for not paying more attention at the people around me, when it comes to making friends of my own; not knowing how to curse them right and blow their minds so they couldn’t hurt me and the ones I love anymore! 
  “I  was  in  Venice  when  it  happened. Right  in  front  of  my  eyes,  a  couple  of  bikes  have  crossed  their  front  wheels  like  two  bulls  fighting  for  the  same  spare-wheel...  or  some thing  alike.  Behind them,  on  the  race-track, thousands  of other bikes  were  fugue-ing, spitting fire out of the rubber of their back-wheels and rising a pleasant smell of smoking  dark-grey material fighting against the asphalt to wittily stay on the ground. 
  I didn’t speak to you, obviously, dear reader, as I can see how much you care already for this blabbing start of a novel; but I did catch your attention with the title and the riots caused around the book and its writer, didn’t I? The riots and the scandals because that’s where a real writer has to end-up his or her   graceful and dignifying existence on earth - in bloody scandal and filthy ways of leading an existence; or in outrageous, sometimes  even tragic behaviour. Yes, I raised my voice against God and His people as if it was His job to look upon this losers-ship filled with idiots fighting with words and images, for words and images healing and killing with sounds while the world is out there fighting for what’s really important: fuels, energy, gold, money..., in one word: power.  So, yes, the weakest of them all, the poet and the writer that has learned how to make himself useful to his country, and not only; 
I got myself into the army and now I’m one of the top soldiers to get a medal for killing the enemy with lots of courage; “the heart of a lion, his” the gang said once to a reporter; “He’s made of iron or stone! I don’t know! He got shot twice, still, no problem getting back on the field as soon as he could lift his arm”, my best friend declared.    “He’s alright!” the major said when asked an opinion. That’s what he says about all of us. At least the way he said it allowed me catch a glimpse of a little pride hidden in his hear. Most of the times he is not showing anything but a bitter trace of contempt on a tired as hell face. He’s no longer the cruel chap he used to be! He lost some of his friends around here, on the field, and this clearly affected his  personal armour. There’s also a rumour about him losing a young relative he didn’t seem to treat any differently, in which case, his dark mood is even more acceptable. But he’s fine with everybody as long as we do our jobs properly not putting to danger our missions.
  Right now I’m in permission; my cousin is getting married and I am the only close relative he wanted around except for his parents and hers. No wedding, only a simple ceremony - there’s no time for fancy stuff around here anyway! One might just release a bomb, by mistake, in an area that’s supposed to be protected, and blow us all up anyway. We’re pretty close to the battle field. They are planning to get married and take off, fly to Bali and find  a way of  making a living there. 
  They’re not pretentious people, they’ll find something. A job for each and a small house where they can raise a couple of kids, maybe get a dog or a cat, or both... a little garden in the backyard  with an apple tree and three cherry ones - was her idea of perfect place to live (it is some obsession of hers with cherry-trees) - of course, all this translated into whatever the heck Bali has to offer to them instead. Meanwhile I’ll just fry my bones in the sun, under the casket, all wrapped in the equipment that’s supposed to save my life but which is actually killing me these days. I feel that the end is near. I never had any problems with any equipment and any weather, it didn’t even bother me when the standard-procedures of a rainy weather got replaced with bad-weather-war-produced bullet-rain, all coming from the grace of the heaviest clouds of steel man-kind ever produced. ‘Was funny for a chap like me finding himself in the middle of such a ... thing... But I’m not afraid, which is quite odd; I was only scared when they bombed one of our tents, making us lose precious materials and a couple of soldiers that happened to be inside at that specific moment in a time becoming more and more unforgettable.  Strange how much we care for the unforgettable moments! Strange how we detach ourselves from the smell and taste of blood and the heavy odours of war once we leave behind everything that was so hurtful for the families in both camps. Strange how much distance we take from those painful moments in order to be able to use the money stained with blood we need so much for survival... “It wasn’t our fault! They started it!” we’ll say to ourselves to comfort our consciousness - just like we did back in our days of schooling, with ‘the enemies’ in the  playgrounds where we fought either for the pleasure of fighting or for the pride of winning a game; sometimes for sweets too. Once I did it for money. 
  Strange a moment for me here, in this town; strange how odd it feels to spend some of the money I’ve earned killing ‘the enemy’ I have no clue about - and thanks God I don’t know them because I couldn’t have done it if I had known any of them at all! 
  Strange a competition too and odd a couple fighting on their bikes like bulls for a wheel that’s been snitched by a funny priest. Odd a feeling to participate to such common life-events! Odd this looseness of the heart I forgot heaving for a breath of fresh air coming with the right package of fun to be enjoyed lively inside loud.  
I am a soldier and a writer now, and no, I won’t give up the next chapter ant that is something to give thanks to you, dear  readers who didn’t give-up reading this little introduction of mine. 
Have a funny, fun-break, or whatever you need until the next chapter of my book here entitled “Sharp Blade Cries” all written in the memory of those who sent us on the field with an equipment and the proper training so we came back alive, willing to tell our stories, willing to participate to what you’ll accept as ‘a normal life’. (Funny I should mention normality, now.)
Thank you mother, thank you father for not letting me down in my times of great need! Thank you, comrades, thank you family and friends! Thank you people still opening books, listening to us and those like us too. Thank you readers; thank you fans (of army-people). Thank you all!”

There is no special reason to think of, right now, for me not to start shooting at class-mates or teachers, trust me; given the situation back home, I feel pretty desperate; the bitch of a thief I spoke to you earlier is systematically getting on my nerves so I’d better find a way to take her off my table ‘cause I wouldn’t even consider cooking her for myself, the stinking goat of a filthy piggy-witch! I would though apply some terrorist attacks on her mind so she’d stop snitching and stealing other people’s works! Anyway! Enough with this, man! - I tell myself this all the time as  am aware that I’ll have to stick being my best friend since nobody is to be trusted around here. Not even a teacher. Last semester a brilliant chap in the third year accused a teacher of using a paper of his in a book he wrote without permission. What is that? Are we cattle to be chopped and used as food for the tables of those who already have their futures lined-up perfectly as we’re thrown away and treated like leaves in the wind after drained of all the good content they can get upon our skinned heads? “Succulent brains, you are! Don’t let them go to a waste!” a teacher said in one of our first classes here. I used to believe that I got the picture of it and understood the value of the words but, it gets clearer and clearer, these days, that I was nothing more than an imbecile thinking himself smart, capable and clever enough to  deal with this place and what’s to follow after - and that’s life, real life, be it with me engaged in University studies or on the work-field, or even worse, which is the ideal case, both.  
*
Go away! 
Get away from here! 
You don’t have any fears implemented by thoughtless families!
Ruthless friends to set you up
for their own children to rise and rise above
the circles of trust 
and the hearts filled with lust 
for anything that’s good in a lifetime spent
into the right daylight, 
the proper night fight,
ways of the good old right side.
-Of which sight- 
Of which fight
-to which right- 
whose fight, whose right 
-what a sight!-

  Every good warrior that’s come to me spoke the same: ‘It is not a real man and warrior the one who fights and abuses women and children, defenseless people, elder people and disabled people; people found in their weakest times or in their resting hours. All the angels agreed. There must be some truth in those words many cling on and share all the time! Looking for the ones adhering and sticking to the same -thinking-ways(?)- values as themselves. There is no crime more horrid than that of corrupting children for your non-dignifying purposes. Every great warrior has spoken to me and right they speak, every time they’re asked an opinion. A warrior of such kind, of the great, he was, in armies fighting for freedom he fought but one day he learned that he was used  by one infamous being, one of the kind he would kill, and then all hell unleashed... he prepared himself for the worst and planned how to put an end to this feast of the sneakiest beasts of all. 
One day he murdered his superior for asking him to do the wrong thing. From then on, he fights against every single creature that fraternises with the devils of the kind he holds his principles and values against since the beginning of the times of all angels! 
*
They’re right to be superior and act as the superior beings they are, 
they’ve earned their rights to do so, the angels and saints
 who have had enough with the filth of the world! 
As long as they’re sending their light to save us, the mortals who still have some needs,
there should be no argument against God’s will! 
As long as we do, what thought to be right for ages and ages going round and round, 
we should be alright. 
‘I am going to liberate myself from the chains of all past killing me!’
‘I am going to fight against all crime, somehow I’ll find a way to do it!’ 
‘I will escape from this cave of bitterness and sadness where nothing good grows!’ 
‘One day I’ll find my way out to your kind arms in which I’d be able to rest this mind of mine, terrorised by terror
and lied by deceiving gardens that walk of two feet, talk with a mouth watching us with eyes
staring down in the crown of screens’ mirroring and thoughts lingering,
longing for what they never knew, 
for what they always wanted to know 
only in terms of a ghost singing still at the Opera House in New York.
*
  Every good warrior who speaks the right truth is wrong on the side where all things must go wrong for them to feel right. Every good warrior looking for the truth has spoken right, acting the ways that honour the heart of the good God they carried inside. Every brave heart has done a mistake or two in a lifetime, but never could they do so wrong as not to be loved and forgiven for their mistakes, never! Every good warrior knows what his truth is and what he or she must fight for; they’ll always be warriors that won’t let themselves be deceived by anyone, following the light of their brave good hearts.

  Am I waiting for the end 
Do I wish for my times here to be worthy of something else?
Do I still keep some hopes-up somewhere out there? 
Is there an ‘out there’ left? 
What am I doing here? 
Hopefully not the worst thing one couldn’t live with after I closed my eyes! That would be too good to be true!
..
Am I waiting for the end? Is this really happening? 
Is she alright, Is he OK!? 
What is wrong with this head of mine seeing some of my characters,
some of my friends, 
something from another world to which I denied myself
the right to be part of... being part of it anyway, 
with or without my own knowledge or the knowledge of an old and dear friend. 
Not the enemy I wish to become.  
Not the one breaking you apart because I needed to.

“A creature coming from God! That’s what I was but they ruined me... First was this evil genius mind trying to make himself the king of someone, a lord, perhaps, luring children into being his slaves; don’t you love these ones? don’t you worship them? don’t tell me you don’t! Don’t even bother! And never tell me that you believe in their salvation - I saw their kind, I could hear and feel the damage they are capable of: too proud their kind to even bother for the ones they scared forever. Too proud of their astonishing achievement! 

I know his kind; appeared like a gifted angel saved by a miracle committing a god damned miracle, and yes, it was doomed and damned this miracle... How could I not be upset? How could you not? How could you accept?

Some do ask the questions and are ready to fall into the exploration once more. Some do believe that it’s worth to be a scientist - others couldn’t just die for that success to pull out the eyes of the abusers and haters of kindness and beauty; these others might just find a way to be just for once and thereon forever in their eternal lives as the Angels of God.”

I’m sorry!
I was wrong thinking her better than I am, than we are!
Please, do not go there, find another one; someone who’d care, who’d give you all the space and time you need;
she is not kind to us to you, 
you go do what you have to do,
 only don’t hurt her, please, the one
You so much needed.
Don’t hurt the one who loved you so!
Don’t turn her into those nightmares you were trying to escape from... 
Don’t

- It is not that I upset him for something that I’ve done! It is not that I was wrong in any way not appreciating myself at the real value. I isn’t because I didn’t know how to play so I didn’t lose! God, I hate myself for what I did or didn’t do to get at peace with myself and the world I was supposed to live in. I just couldn’t! When I’m sad I am this way because I couldn’t make it where I always felt I was belonging to. 
- And where is that? Everywhere except some places your enemies would simply love to see you so they can mock you instead of respecting you?!

- Where did they got all their knowledge from? Why did they have to use their power like this? Cold monstrosity, that’s how I call this! Cold cruel monstrosity; do you believe in us?! Do you believe in me?

- All those little stories that you tell,
About Snow Whites and Cinderellas making it to the top,
About heroes defeating their monsters... 
They are the loveliest wrap.
All those traditional stories about backgrounds telling tales of the hard times you had,
defeating dragons and terrible monsters,
hoping not be trapped into becoming one of them
in the very end.
“You know, after the storm there comes light...” they used to say. 
The weather’s showing it only too fun and well. 
“And better times still come after a cruel war or a battle.”
It came, the light, those times appear to be right for everyone; what now?
- Well, if Cinderella made it you should be okay... on the top

Mate!

- To me he was a hero, one that survived, my husband. One couldn’t convince him that what he was doing wasn’t right. He risked a lot saving me, so never ever speak ill of him in front of me again!
- Now that’s a beautiful way of showing the way you feel! And just how did you get to actually fall in love with him!? 
- I never fell in love with anyone. I’m not one to lose her head over anything or anyone. I was properly raised and very well trained, she responded in brightly tints of metal tales showing on her face, thunderous lightnings coming out her eyes!. 
- I see... quite a pair, you two though! Never thought someone can live this way and actually look this happy when all I can imagine is sadness and loneliness in two. 
- Well, don’t put yourself in our shoes, then! she smiled and turned around for a friend tapping her shoulder. 
.
- So, this is my idea, a fortunate time in that protection-hub, creator of beauty out of a hell of a situation!

- Now, here is Thor, the son of Jupiter (who by the way fucks many people and has tons of children) and Thor is one of those children of his nobody knows in the world that adores Jupiter. But he is much adored by his adepts and the people on Earth where he becomes a real hero, you know?
- Yes, I know! If you want to see him you should go to Comic-Con!

- Look, man! I don’t want to survive! Survival is stupid! Survival is wrong! What is right is to live! 
- Sometimes survival can offer people hope! 
- How would you like yourself in the shoes of a disabled by the superiority of others? By the majority of others! Don’t you think Death has her reasons to start paying back some tributes, some shows? Some life? 
- As far as I know, that’s the Angel’s of Retri...
- ... a job! You always see things as jobs! I see it as a duty and an honour!
- Way, man! We’re  basically talking about the same thing!
..
- This woman is strange; a lot of too-too trains. offered in vain. 
..
- Why would you make her pay the bills of her mothers?
- Because, she isn’t the good child we wanted. 
- Not the bad one, either! 
- See what I mean!? Too boring a heaven to live in. I’m sorry.
..
I was saved from eternal times of sadness, 
I was protected from getting harmed, 
I was trying to get away with my dreams and the try to have a beautiful life. 
I was loved and cared for by an angel that wanted me rather dead
than destroyed and defeated by someone as ugly as hell.
...
- They kept praying and painting and making the place a most beautiful one until their place got to be the most peaceful and wonderful one ever!
- You must be kidding me! Just like in a convent? 
- No, not really. Only a place created as a retreat for the damaged by a ruthless cruel world!

- .... there was this completely white bike outside the garden that completed the whole scenery! It appeared from nowhere and to nowhere it was taken after we sold the house!

- Are you superior because you already lived your most wonderful lives already?

- Around there respect is gained with the fist! Respect is gained sometimes with a lie! Respect is gained only when you get to harm someone... The question is: will there ever be justice made or we’ll just have to take matters in our own hands and start doing the killing?.

- If that was thinking then I don’t want to know!

- I need to see her again!
- Again!?

Heartless, ruthless bastards and their solitary ladies flying above our children’s heads!
-I  wanna be like them! I wanna be like them! our poor babies cry! 
- I want to be strong and ruthless for a change! I want myself invincible! And I want it now! I know that I won’t be wrong! I.am not ...wrong!
-  It was nothing but a bad dream, that’s all! 
- I tell you, there’s nothing to worry about...
.
- They’ll lead you where they want to, if you don’t run in time. It’s not that you haven’t been warned a long-long time before times changed, they never can change for someone not understanding the miracle of life embracing it no matter what... as if this wasn’t the first mistake back then! Being too natural and happy a child, not being aware.
.
- I will be ugly enough to fry you if you dare to try to force me into doing anything against my will; I will destroy you before getting the chance to deceive me once again!
.
- If I’m not brilliant nor will you be! 
If I will not be brilliant, you will never be! - 
*an awful smile of an equally proud hero*
.
- I tried to be like you, I wanted to be happy, you didn’t want me but for your historic ugly realities. U tried to behave nicely but you wanted me real; your most awful nightmare I’ll be for making me pay for something unfair! I may be sad and lonely, I used to know what love is. I cared, I offered, I helped... you didn’t want to love and protect me, now I am dead. Alive I’ll be and I will fly away, leaving behind the ugliness you wanted us to be fried with to help you burn and rot. You grew me tired of hoping and trying; you grew me sick of your twisted and evil minds!

“I am talking about you, most of the times,

Everything is ...
One way or another, 
About you and me,
- Me and you?
Us, finding ourselves and one another, 
Sometimes.”

”By the stone of miracle-sunny days, the stone of the moon was waiting for the werewolves to come and rescue her. The evil witch didn’t die, she knows how to survive. I tried to ban her from our world but she has lovely friends to come by my house and speak against everything I do. I’ll let them be the subjects of her fun and funny experiments - if that’s what they want!
By the stone of miracles she sat and wondered ‘what to do’ and ‘how to help’ her people out.”

- Oh, that’s an honour! Thank you! 
- Top five, mate! Top five! 
.
- Right there, by the part of the thrones one used to look up for their wealth and down at the starving people they always mocked and laughed at.
.
- It’s a world of possessions that seemed to rule out there, ...

A dream of magnificence is all that we want! 
A dream of being and becoming a star! 
A dream of amazing magnificence is
what we want, what we long for, 
a wish for our souls gone with the spirit,
one love for one home. 
The travelers’ speaking: 
One wish for one soul, 
a dream of magnificence is what we all want. 
One dream of magnificence 
is what will tare your spirit apart! 
Mine was fine, I was feeling alive even if dead!
This dream of magnificence that can tare us apart!
I felt like already there, riding my star-bike towards the skies, 
watching the moon smiling, then crying like a fool, for what the moon was already, 
the one and only spoon full of spices and sugar, filled with hopes and dreams:
That dream of magnificence is already gone, my dear!

- Well, you see? You have good things to offer from the good past you lived! ‘was helped to live a life of wonders!

.
- Que haces, querida? 
- Perdon!
.
- Done cursing, now what? Can I just simply go out there for a walk, do my thing? Maybe enjoy some painting? 
May I just fantasize about the lost times projected over me? May I embrace the lost beauty and live the childish dream of childhood? 
- Be... the f... you are, just live us alone!
- It is good to see the understanding you are! It fills my heart with the joy of the pure spirit of bright loneliness that found companionship in books and shows, the products of what used to be either fair or wrong in you and us all, the product of our experiences and imaginations combines; products of what we’ve seen and of what we spoken of or lied about.

- There a little bit of something good as there’s a little bit of something mean and wonderful in everyone of us!

- The finest way of saying, “I’m sorry but I will have to join the sellers for a piece of pie and a cup of tea, lemonade or for a beer.”
- I like wine. 
- Wine’s good. Wine will do for me too. 
- All the friendship that could have resulted out of this... madness... 
I’m sorry to have learned what you managed to create for yourself with us. Let’s just hope that you will never live it, that nightmare.

Vapeurs magiques!

- I was wrong, my child. Heaven is not something to deserve but something to fight for and earn in a competition that has nothing to do with any rules or values or kindness... 
- How come, father? 
- It’s about competition all the time; you cannot take pride on your own good will or actions... they’ll take those merits away... you’ll not be able to enjoy a life consumed by joy and happiness unless a murderer, a thief, an asshole... I’m sorry to have misled you! I’m sorry to have tried to make a worthy person of you... This world... I left behind a long long time ago... because it simply doesn’t deserve to be treated with any respect, attention and care.. they mock  our principles and values... they mock us for being good or kind, for trying to be honest... and at peace with ourselves... they mock us for looking for that trouble making us all happy: for being useful and kind, forgiving, with those we chose to give a try to and merciless towards those who deceived us greatly; it’d make them happy too only they don’t know how to  offer something good or kind so how could they value who and what we are?... I’m sorry, son! I’m sorry! If you want to be part of their world you’ll have to be like them and mess with the ugly... become an ugly thing... Just take care of your shell, make it look nice enough so they’d be ... mistaken forever, just the ways they like. 
- How do you want to hurt? In reality or simply say a word or two, show a little mercy when that would hurt some prides, show a little compassion or mock us all around? How would you like to be hurt, child? In reality or simply never hurt... because there is no reason to hurt or get hurt anymore...? 
.
- There’s nothing to lose from all this, girl! Only to win!

- He finally found his peace! Why couldn’t you let him live that peace? she asked. 
- Sometimes it is better not to ask. Just go on with your passionate goals or resurrect the memory of whatever you could have lived beautifully and loved.

“She always hated our youth, our wisdom, our energy and audacity to rise again and again, each time someone felt like doing a nice gesture of friendship or the one of an enemy; I’ll be your enemy if I have to, just don’t become the ugly thing they wanted you to become!

- The earth cracked and a miracle happened for a poor family working there, on the construction field. They found gold; it just came out after the sudden inexplicable break of a pipe in the ground. 
- Gold. hum, How come? Under the shape of... jewellery?
- Hmm no... it was pure gold, I tell you. Their daughter, the architect and their son the archeologist studied the place carefully and, after seeing that there was no piece of gold related to an artefact, they decided to keep it since they needed to pay for their research and studies. It was a miracle to them, I tell you! They never expected this to happen right before announcing they’d resign due to lack of sufficient funding. 
- So now they can go on studying? 
- They can do much more and they have great ideas ahead! They want to reconstruct some buildings the old-fashioned ways, make a cultural park around the ruins of some citadels, recreate a noble land lost a long time ago and the old villages around, kept in the best shape ever after the restoration. It’s madness, I tell you! Total madness!
- The loveliest and best madness of all!.

- Just when I thought that I was helping, I knew that I had found the perfect combination - you were loathsome - here you come and show me that I was all wrong, not caring for you all but caring for myself and for my son, my daughters and my children, all, they’re all my children: never meant to hurt them but they tried to little to become the better human that you were. Perhaps it is wisdom to ask for in return for a great favour!

- This report of yours is killing me!

Well... we need a little space, there must be some distance between us so I can do that... in some cases this distance measures in time too. Anyway, someone who would do just about anything to get what they want is someone who will never change. I can’t do just about anything... anything means quite anything... anything means ... anything - think about anything and see if you’d like that to happen to you. Then we’ll talk about it, okay?

“You can say whatever you want, 
see no matter what you want 
us to believe 
- this is perfect - 
*What are kids supposed to do, but feel free to play and believe in wonders?* 
(our children should believe in love and miracles!) 
* feel free to be one! Feel free to love the life you’ve been now offered! * 
(be careful though since justice comes around!) 
- be kind and gentle, strong and wrong! Be square like the fair and offer -

- You didn’t see the whore I am! Just wait until you look into the crystal bawl! 
- He he! I never thought this was quite possible! 
- See?
- The stinkiest one! He he he! 
- Excuse me, I am a professional! 
- He he he! 
(they both laugh and raise their glasses to their successful failure) 
- They say that in life we must first fail in order to succeed! I wonder why is that!
- How else could we become stronger? What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger! 
- And what kills you must bring you where? In heavens or hell! 
- Well, it depends. If you enjoy having the power of dealing with a hell of a situation and get yourself out of it victoriously then... you got yourself into the storm of the after-life effect. It can be cruel, it can be dangerous, it could be simply fun and wonderful. 
- And that would depend on the gravity of the facts? 
- That would depend on everything and everyone you managed to hold dear to, on way or another. 
- Isn’t that a bit ridiculous? I mean, how do you know? I mean for sure!
- You don’t. We never know for sure, we always look for a deeper understanding without knowing anything for sure. 
- Huh! Not my kind of thing. 
- Mine either. See, I do prefer to stick to the knowledge that is convenient to me. If I could change something, though, that would be us getting misled and deceived, cheated-on and utterly mistaken.

I should have stolen something from you, I should have pushed you to the limit and break you,
I should have taken the revenge I deserve 
for making me thirsty with anger! 
I’ll now how to walk, instead, I’ll know how to dance and how to fight, 
I’ll know when to smile, how to smile, 
I’ll know what to do so I get my well-to-do 
anywhere I go.”

“Is there a goddess or god to love me in my times of need? Is there an angel to care for me? Was my despair for nothing? My wishes, thoughts and dreams? Were all those prayers in vain? What about all our tears? 
.
- It seems to me that I am looking for trouble. I just have to get rid of this phantom called Guilt. 
.
- Don’t expect a star to care! They never care. They shine! It’s their job to shine and spread either too much warmth or too much coldness. 
..
- Don’t you get it!? You can’t just break someone’s heart like this then expect them to get over it! You cannot hurt somebody like that and then expect them to shine like a fresh immortal rose in the sun!
- Perhaps it was just not the right time! 
- Yeah! Perhaps she doesn’t want to forget so that nobody got her broken again! 
- Perhaps you’re not a man enough for her! 
- True. Perhaps,... neither are you.
.
- Back in those days when things felt like possible, no matter what... 
 “This sentiment of not doing, always, the wrong-right thing right-wrong... not being actually wrong.”
*
Weren’t you, perhaps, the scientist? A star! weren’t you?
Aren’t I?
Trying to find the clues for the fairest of goodbye?

Don’t lie to me!
- Lie to me!
- Never dare-you lie to me!
*
- So, did you do anything useful with my anger, with my wrath? Did you get what you wish for or this was all made for you to have some fun? 
..
- Words are words and they don’t matter as much as you think or feel right now! Not everything we say or do is a curse! A blessing and a part of life this is! And what you do, your wishes, purposes and tears, your laughter and your joy will never be in vain! 
..
- And you call this not premeditated and well organised a crime?!
..
“I’d walk for it. I’d run for it! 
I’d do whatever it takes!
I’d fight for it!”
.
-
- Why do I even bother!? Some say “one way or another!” Should I fight for anything? What for, so that you did it and I did what? 
- It’s just for us to have some fun, don’t bother!
- Why am I still trying to get there where I wanted to believe that I belonged? It seems to me that feeling is the greatest sins of all! 
.
- What is this? 
- The invincible assassin!... 
.
- Now see, here is the difference between you and me!
- I wouldn’t just do anything for it!
- You and I? humm...
.
- A few words about your character, please. 
- Hmm... he is kind and gentle and sweet and funny and I am missing myself not so, if you excuse me I’ll go get a cup of tea or something and pretend I didn’t just hear what I heard from you earlier. Sorry, bad moment, that’s all! 
.
- Now... Weren’t you a most brilliant investigator! Asking to see behind the face, behind the movement of an eye, behind a gesture and a smile?
..
- The worm was placed into her mind, she managed to fight it! The worm was eating her alive: she used it and made something beautiful out of her chained soul! How could you possibly think like that of her? How could you hurt them all?
.
- ‘The Rat House’! That is the name of the film!
- Isn’t that a book!?
- It’s actually a movie!
.
- I am the only one who didn’t understand that he had to kill himself, that I have to kill myself if I want anything much better. I am unique in my own way, some call this one a fighter, But what I am is what you are for not forgetting and not hurting another mom the way you got yourself hurt. Let’s hope this time someone will care about you and your son the same way that I did!
.
- God, I’m such a liar! I cannot believe myself sometimes!
.
- Life wasn’t too difficult for us, was it? 
.
- She needs a man mature enough to take it! Maturity is not necessarily age-linked or related to freedom.
- You think this’ll help?
- I don’t know, but I believe that your girl got herself into some trouble without knowing she did so... or did you...? 
(No...! You wouldn’t! You... couldn’t have...! done that!).
.
“Don’t fool yourself! Try not to flatter yourself, now, honey! 
	My gift to you, the shining miracle you always knew you were! 
Not understanding what was that you hated in me! 
Keep guessing that it was, perhaps, the fact that you thought yourself much wiser, 
perhaps much better than a tool to be used and left behind! 
Don’t fool yourself! 
Don’t flatter yourself too much, now, darling!”
.
.- Only he can help her, now! God, what have we done!?
- Don’t be so worried! We’ll think about something! There’s always something to be done... there’s always some hope left in a corner of one mind; always a gift. Always something to be done. 
- There must be, mustn’t it!? 
- Yes... there must be...some hope left somewhere.
.
- You don’t understand! I am supposed to cry now for everything I did, for everything I didn’t do, for what I couldn’t do...! I am supposed to lighten-up! I am supposed to meditate and think!
.
- After we’re gone, all this will not count for us anymore, you most certainly know this, don’t you? 
- Ah, what a sweet revenge of the dead and buried for their dead and forgotten temporary losers of the skies!
.
“I can’t seem to get out of my head this image of a little girl, an angel filled with resent, with hatred for not doing something for her... I couldn’t... perhaps... I should... have... I just lacked the presence in spirit to help, the one to guide me  so I helped... I wish I could say to myself that’s all for the best but I don’t feel this way. I don’t feel this way at all... Why can’t I stop feeling responsible for ... that poor little angel crying for help!... God, help her! Please!”
.
- You were an example to take, someone who’d keep looking for something great, to be great like you are!
- I am not great and you know this is true, I am who I am...
- Amazing: this is you!

.
- That’s how I call this! ...
-  a poem! It’s my life and it is a poem of a life!
.
“I don’t want back there and I won’t go back, be it okay with you or not, this decision of mine! a voice got heard right before the start of a strange melodic sound. 
-You must go there! I need you there! My world needs you there! 
A thunderous crash of luminous decay of power. Flashbacks of a second then the light back on. 
The extremely powerful riff of an electric guitar begins the storm.
- Fuck your world! I was deceived by your world!
I can’t trust anyone out there! How can I be of any help!? 
How could I? 
..
- A world of theirs where they can live the way they want, where they can steal and kill; where they can rule for being trained on how to do that! A world of miracles open to a society that doesn’t deserve it! Only, they needed someone who had the innocence to open the gates of heavens and have all the angels go down and fight for what’s  to fight for: only the righteous should win! Only the good-side. Don’t you ever judge someone too wrong. Don’t you ever kill the innocent.  Don’t you ever hurt someone too deeply! Don’t you ever create a monster out of a beautiful angel!
..
-Relax my child! 
from distant times a friendly voice helped through in the silence of a break. 
Then the riff picked-up from where it left and went on
throwing the garbage out.
(.or at least what was garbage to them.)”
.
- Don’t be a saint! Saints are fools! The fools of every nation and every single organization they meet. The world doesn’t need saints, my friend. The world needs good people, nice human beings to let themselves talked into believing in the idea of their freedom of choice and fighting for it, for whatever they need or feel the need to fight for. 
- Don’t be a saint! Saints die young and most of them deceived by their people! Then they fall in disappointment: for what? Did they believe they can change the world? 
- Thanks for the advice, I’ll keep that in mind! the answer came. A few moments of silence in the memory of something sad (it was just one experience, that’s all! An ugly experience - probably like these two - I should take a better look into their eyes, into their souls and see what lies in there, find my own cure from this sad theme.) You two are very good friends, he spoke. 
- Yes, we are! 
- Indeed! 
Though their smiles spoke a lot more to the kid.
.
- It’s just a feeling I’m catching! I’ll just have to wait and see what to do with it... and how to explain it through the expression itself. Isn’t that what we always do!? I mean, look around! 
..
(You saved her! Thank you! Thank you for saving him too!)
.
- Only to win this time! 
- Well, well, well.... 
..
Burn, burn, burn, 
Burn all the surplus of fun
in the shape of whom and what you love!
Creating an artwork for our spiritual home.  
..
- We had a most wonderful life together! I couldn’t have dreamed it in any other way! I simply couldn’t have! He was the love of my life and I simply couldn’t forget, I couldn’t think of another one to love more! I couldn’t! He was the love of my life and I tried to be and managed to be who and what he loved forever with all of his heart. His love  showed to me like nothing else in the world! I know now, that wherever my soul is, he is crying a tear out just like I am crying one. I was among the ones very loved, appreciated and valued; not among those lost and forgotten, thrown away for whatever a reason one might have to treat someone this way. I was and I am loved by everyone because he loved me truly. Even their hatred managed to save me, that loved I was. So, yes, I had real reasons to be proud! And I have real reasons to be angry and mad at the world for even thinking to take that away from me! I am talking about the greatest love anyone could think of, imagine or experience. It is what most of you have without realising you have it! It is what I had and lost! What am I supposed to say now? Thank you... “fake love?”
..
“She promised a lot and did what was allowed to do, breaking some rules, getting upset, sometimes even mad with herself! Then the world had to come and tell her what was all about, let her know who did what to whom... still, she wouldn’t believe every joke or tear for she knows that sometimes only a miracle can make peace with the hell of a decision someone else took for her to get back there where she could have been a star. It’s not about me or you. It’s not even about them. It’s about every single piece of human material wanting to get there - some have what it takes, others earn it, many do the lottery and a few win and conquer it all. I just happened to know that I could; I didn’t want to believe that someone is going to come one day and make a mess, a total wreck of myself and then expect me to think myself as the winner and be pleased with what I achieved. It takes a while to remember and learn that even if you knew, trained yourself and tried you didn’t do that quite so well that nothing interfered with ‘your master-plan’. 
- Man, one really must be prepared for the school you’re teaching! 
- I am not teaching you anything. I speak mostly from my experience and the one of those I managed to be around with and or read about. 
- Do you always speak like that, Sean?
- Well I trained myself to be  a doctor... a doctor of letters, first of all. When you see me on the street next time say: “Hey, doc! How are you?” Michael! Say it like that and we’ll be okay, we’ll be fine... I got my share, you got yours and we managed to show our little kid “The Place”. 
- What a beautiful story! You know, I kinda’ feel gay now! 
- A must, I’d  say, to be interpreted part, nothing more. ‘Come on! The stage is all ours: there are no women around. Somebody has to play the price and make a fool out of himself.”
.
Asking for justice, 
you’re one of a kind, 
one of those (either) treated unfairly 
(or) cunningly looking down,
up and down for a way out, 
out of their personal hell,
 out of their illusions that they can change the shape of the world, 
the ways in which things work
(for themselves)
For the things that you think that you must know.
.
- I want my share of guilt, now!
.
- The world needs both sides. You cannot eliminate one side, it’s like cutting the Planet in two. Then what? What you ‘ll see on the other-side you’ll either miss or wish to have; or, if that sad, remember you used to love to see the beauty contained by it and work for the bettering and the improvement where spotting a need.
.
- If I had some pride I would kill myself now. There is no reason to go on like this; I came to the feeling that it would be amazing and great to see you all in tears.
.
- A lack of responsibility is a lack of responsibility. When someone tries to turn you into what you are not and gets to make something awful out of something beautiful then something must be done! Don’t you think that someone should pay for what they have done to you, dear? ‘Cause I do!
.
- So, you do know something about true love, after all! 
- Go to hell! 
.
The greatest mistake I did, 
Haven’t I already confessed?
I was filled with mistakes, 
Couldn’t you see? 
What an awful thing I always held inside: kept wondering why, 
trying to solve a puzzle,
finding an answer to my prayers
- somehow you got to me and then more than I thought got fired out in the shape of a smoking note-pad -
.
- Gabriel, no! Don’t pull that... (a vase made of copper falls down on the floor) 
- Now, can we go and see that show? 
- In an hour or so! Until then, please, behave!
.
- I don’t understand you! Why would you choose that hour of extreme happiness if what comes after is only pain and suffering? Why? 
- To be honest, I’d go all the other way around but it seems that I don’t know how! They’re always stronger than what seems to be right for me! 
- Aren’t they lovely!? Aren’t they sweet? 
- Oh, well! I’ll just have to lose my faith in them, that’s all! I’m not going to make a religion out of this fight for everyone to win a battle for their own purposes and goals.
- Not without getting something out of it, most certainly. 
- Put it the way you want for yourself. I’m tired of fighting a crime that’s been there for ages and ages since the many had to win.
.
- How is this result of your great master-plan work? How do you feel? Don’t tell me there’s no master plan. You were a part of it! I tried like a fool to adapt. This bloody work of art of yours: the MaSTRe plan.
.
- You know what? I don’t even want to know how awful you feel right now! I don’t want to know it for sure. I believe that I can understand some things clearly. Who am I, who are you in this playful tragedy but a grain of sand, a little ant, a worm... Do you believe that a spirit can be held in any of those ones because they’re many more and you are only one? 
..
- Simsalladim he said and the magic chest opened.
- Did he find what he was looking for? 
- Only some old carpets. Some of them were magic and some, he found later, were hiding very important and valuable secret information with them.
.
- Have you ever heard of “The wish master”? Well, there you go!
- Wow! The music... the lyrics! The song!
.
Burn, burn, burn! 
All the surplus in the shape of a heart! 
Burn it so you can stay alive! 
Burn it so you died in peace,
For the love of God.
.
- If I cried enough for justice, if I asked, I prayed, I worked! If I sang and if I wrote, would you place my questioning and my answers right where they belonged?
.
- I always hated women like you! Don’t think that you can make it up here with an idiotic tribute paid for nothing, paid for your miserable call to a childish wish nobody wanted to come true to you around here anymore!
..
.
- Will you allow me to be your guide and your partner? 
- Sure, why not?!
.
It should mean something else, 
I don’t know how to make this change happen, 
I’m tired of suffering in vain. 
The short way would be the answer but there’s a long one imposed, 
All that should be forgotten
and I should work as before: 
at peace with what will come, 
fighting for whatever is fair,
fighting for my own people, 
the free and innocent who had nothing to do with this call; 
The free and innocent who didn’t mean any harm, 
the honest who wanted to apply some justice into this world.
.
- Impressive a naive! 
.
Not asking how could I have done something great!
Impressive a thing, 
Impressed by the beauty behind a face, 
Impressed by the ugliness too.
Impressive a naive, I didn’t have anything to lose
But fun was there for me to have, 
Impressed with the mind that you have worked on developing. 
Impressed by a naive he’s walking his ways towards the ends of a ghost’s lucidity! 
How could you hate us so much? 
And why don’t I believe in everything that I see or hear? 
.
- Quite impressive a ghost!
There is this planet that’s our tomb from which we send out messages
to the untold new heavens, 
it is not me that they are talking about 
it’s some memoir from a heavenly state of mind that I’m experiencing. 
You spoke to me about how much you cared
and what I meant to you, now you are away, away with the song I am looking for: 
I’m missing your songs, your ideas, your thoughts: 
Please, do be different, a little different somehow...
much different than I am, 
we’re still be the same, 
we’re still be the brothers and sisters
that went through hell and can understand. 
- Our hell was gentle enough with us, do know - 
- our God and his goddess-like angels helped us all -
through out pains, our aches, our tears and our sorrows.
.
- You lie to me and to yourself only to ease the pain, you say that everything is fine when everything is not okay, just okay; you’re doing too well not choosing too much, why didn’t you say anything about it earlier? 
- SO grateful to her god for nothing at all! It’s nothing what he did for you, my precious lovely one! 
- So grateful to her people, her parent and herself! Too grateful being able to ease her pain, your pain.
.
Bells are telling about 
Christmas, and prayers and dead people ringing themselves out;
Out, Out, Out, of the graves you were forced living! 
Get out there! 
Out with you, souls and zombies! 
Look at yourselves! 
Did you die? 
How was your flight? 
Out, out, out! 
Tell a story about the hell or heavens you lived! 
Out, out, out! 
Be alive and well!
.
- You’re hating a mirror of yourself doing her job!
.
“Heal me, please! Heal me of my nightmares! Heal me of my pain! 
Heal me! 
Save me from despair! 
Heal me! Someone save me from the ugliness inside! 
Please, save me from myself and the evil I!”
..
- You left me here, to waste a life in its entirety in the name of what!?!
-  I’m sorry... p...
- Oh! Right! And now I am supposed to be happy! all thrilled about what you did! May I pay for one more bill please! ‘Cause you’re perfect, coming right from the very perfect family that lied and cheated forever, forever got the things you wanted!
- Please! 
- No! Please! Fuzz-off!.
.
- I got healed! You will not infest me with what made me ill with sorrow and despair!
..
- I am happy for you! 
- Yeah, that’s why you cry! That’s why you’re hurting inside. 
- Don’t pity me and don’t explain to me how I feel. It wouldn’t change a thing... Just be happy for yourselves and what you achieved.
..
- So, her story was told for the sake of telling a story?
- More or less; so was his... and who knows how much of it was real and how much was only fake insertions?
..

*I loved seeing you happy, don’t take that away from me! 
I loved knowing that there is faith and strength enough 
for everybody to overcome a situation like this
then  live. 
.
..
- ‘Cause heroes need to stay alive, that’s why dude!
..
- Did you hear about heaven in hell? What about the hell in your heaven? Should you worry about losing both of them? Should I bother? Shouldn’t I? Get well soon, you hellish prison of love!
..
- It was a promise that she made and that was to make a twisted world be even more twisted than before! 
It was a promise made to destroy something that felt good for some but awfully wrong for others. It was a promise they made to carry on with a fight for whatever they want. 
- Yes, alright, but what do you want? 
- Right now, I want to leave it all behind for them to take it away as they promised and start a brand new existence elsewhere!
..
- Jason was the best friend I ever had! How could you do this to him?
- Oh, don’t be a moron! He left and never gave a sign. You’re still here; what kind of a friend is that.
- Well, there is a time for everyone to take off. Who knows, maybe we will meet again.
.
Jumping from one trap to another,
trying to dance as gracefully and powerfully as you can,
Around here things never seem to be normal,
just not the normal kind you wish to believe in.
Jumping from one trap to another, why not, it depends
On the people who are guiding you, helping you move or stay.
..
- Do not mess with the ways I choose to live something imposed by any force or creature! It is my choice, my god won’t ask from me to be just everything I do or write about literally! My god is God and he is proud, This Universe is proud enough not to prevent us from evolving, wishing working dreaming, doing something for one another! 
Don’t mess with the ways I have chosen to live some things that shouldn’t be imposed to anyone... at least I have some real friends to support me in my times of need! What do you have and why!? Just think about it!
..
- Do not invite me somewhere to feel unwelcome to participate or enjoy! Do not invite me anywhere unless you want me to be part of it: enjoy!
.
- One day, whoever broke you will pay... They never get away with this, you know this for sure. 
(a burst of laughter through tears and mucus revealed their minds working together)
- You’re funny! 
- Yes I am!
.
- Trust me, man! It is better not to exist at all than be destroyed that way! It brings trouble into the world, as you might already know, so, no; if I have to destroy some human body like that, then no. 
- What if they’re evil?
- They’re not. They’re human. They make their mistakes but they are human. Those who are not humans, those are to be helped for a recovery. They should be the ones getting the pills and treatments they need or just isolated, left alone or killed. 
- A spirit hurt cannot be destroyed! Know this, please. That’s why... that is precisely why....
..
- You’ll learn about your place, in time, don’t worry.
.
- Take the poison and make something of it! Make a joke, make a potion, make a miracle happen... do whatever you want, whatever you need to do. Make of this potion whatever you feel like doing.
.
 I will never be okay, now I know this for sure; 
not having the courage of doing that necessary thing for the responsibilities that I created for myself
 - willingly or not, I was available for a try. 
Now that I failed I’ll have to keep going on. 
There’s no other choice, no other choice given, when not having the courage of doing the right thing.
(wasn’t all that confusion goddam fun?)
.
- Forgiveness! Forgiveness is the answer, I tell you! One has to forgive in order to succeed. 
- But isn’t that a form of lying? 
- What? No... there is no lying if you truly forgive. 
- Well... as long as that won’t make me go back to the times forgiven and forgotten, I guess that I can actually agree.
.
- Just tell me the names under which I’ll be allowed to publish my works so I didn’t listen to you!
.
- There is a world out there that deserves to be destroyed, only to be destroyed!
.
See? I can slam some doors too! 
It is not that hard a thing to do 
once you took a little too much from the beautiful world you lived in!
See? I can act like a total bitch too!
Calling you all the names, saying what you are, 
what you may mean to me:
-perhaps you are, perhaps you’re not!-
One day you’d like to be one of those names in a particular way.
See!? I can be upset and evil!
 I can be the woman you want me to be; 
appeal to normality... since this is the normal you seek, the normal you make happen!
the normal way you lived.
The one you’re trying to do... You’ll never, never, never do me...
*
A fine bouquet of ‘Thank You’s!” to you
beloved heroes of infinite sorrow-land-lordship.

- In time you will see and find the utility of everything that’s been said or done. This acceptance ship is the losers ship! I hate you for forcing me into this losers-ship! I love you! ! I hate you!!
- You know, you should make-up your mind! 
.
- My ways will be better, she spoke.

In love with something once left behind, 
feeling like coming back home, 
feeling like going out there
for the find of a lifetime
forgotten to be remembered, 
remembered so we can forget.
.
Remembering something once left behind, 
hopefully not too poisoned a place to make you forget about yourself. 
Not going to ask you to be the same you were before if this is damaging to you, my dear! 
Sometimes wounds just have to be left alone to heal.
Sometimes wounds get to heal faster than you would believe: 
then you will finally know what is right and wrong; 
then you will see what is for you and what is not for you to be.
Sometimes wounds
...
have faith
(in something everyone has to believe)

- Those who constantly and sometimes obstinately ask for justice, keeping it on this same page are those who were treated unfairly, he spoke.
- You think so? 
- I know so! 
- What about those who fight against whatever might seem unfair? 
- Those are the real example of the human loved and appreciated for who they are. They were empowered to do so and that comes only with a great amount of love and care.They are the ones who weren’t changed or convinced to change somehow... Those who were not forced to change for the sake of some perfidious world.

Hear my cry - there’s no cry, 
hear my soul - there’s no soul
to have cared more. 
Hear my savage spirit
(fighting against crimes) 
killing, burdening, cursing
(back)
someone evil but kind
(do you know the evil but kind? They kindly sentence you and make you suffer no matter what you deserve)
I’ll kill in the name of that justice! 
I’ll kill for the pleasure of seeing real beauty; 
I’d kill for a good cause, I’d pray and spit fires in the name of my God. 
. 
Hear my words! 
They’ll resonate in you forever, 
I’ll make you find the truth behind them, some day; 
so please, deserve just more than an ugly and fastidious experience! 
.
- I never really loved you and you know that this is true... I could have loved you but you hurt me deeply with your decision to humiliate me this way, so... 
- There is no way of being humiliated that should be acceptable. Whoever forces us into knowledge like that is looking for something that isn’t the appropriate thing for any human, for any spirit, for anyone. 
- Oh, what a child you are! 
- Ah, I am dazzled by your maturity... 
.
- You are not going to use me the way you want! I don’t trust you! I don’t trust women and I don’t trust men... Here’s a lesson learned. Now let me learn about something else than the regret of being born!
.
- What did I say? I I wasn’t allowed to make it then you will be forced to? a bitter smile from both sides. 
.
- Unfairly accused some people, don’t you think? 
- Yeah! That’s why every time something unfair is about to happen... poof! Ans splash the fun in the eyes of those who think themselves better.
.
- I created a hopeful world for them to be the ways they like being! I don’t understand them now! What do they want from me?
.
- So, how’s class?
- It’s fine. May we not talk about it, please?
.
Know that I love acting more than anything else in the world. Still, I do have feelings and I can use them against you all. Just be unfair to me and unfairness is what you will get to be rewarded with.
.
- One more try! Give me one more shot at this one. 
- Here’s a shot of tequila. 
- And here a scar to bless and liberate from the dust and sweat all over it. 
(she turns around and throws it in the face of the one who planned a great charade to make her look more stupid than ever)
- Out of pride, dear! Out of pride!
.
- You don’t have the heart to commit any murder, admit it! 
- Just as you don’t have the heart to kill yourself when time comes, dear.
* 
Maybe we’re right, maybe we’re wrong, 
maybe you should have fought better. 
If acceptance means failure then no. 
.
- I couldn’t have lost what I didn’t have, you see, I couldn’t have lost her money. I needed to do what I did, she was too ugly for me and my people - We need our perfect swans to be happy and develop beautifully.
.
- It depends on how you see things, what you detect as happiness and what as a regret.  
- I regret not killing someone. 
- I regret not ending a nightmare. 
- I regret not loving more.

- So, I said to him ‘You do not love me for who and what I am! You only love the image of this body of mine which is of interest and you’ll hold dear to as long as it will be animated by the proper spirit. 
You do not love me! You never loved me for who and what I am!’
- And how did he respond to all that?
- Oh, I don’t remember. It was all a long-long time ago... 
- How could you not remember? 
- I don’t know! I simply forgot!
.
- Oh, what a dream, what a dream we lived! The most beautiful dream of all! How could I repay you all for this dream, this beautiful dream!? Oh, the beautiful amazing dream we lived!
.
- In a state of calm acceptance they worked together as a team. Men like her have to look for “the one”, Women like her have to choose properly from the very beginning and demons have to do their demonic work. 
- Not happy with the results. 
- Who would be? 
.
- You won’t get me with that fake innocent look, Mr., so don’t even try, don’t you dare... don’t...
.
- It’s hard to carry her around sometimes, it’s hard to take this little queen of ours! She’s tough a girl! 
.
- A boy, A boy! They have a boy! It’s a boy!
(they’re raising their glasses for the boy.)
- A prince. 

- ...a star!
.
We need both sides to survive,
This world has stupid fights that need to be carried out, 
For the world to be a better one outside there. 
There is the family of the divine and here the one reflecting all the wars in the history of hell
(on Earth, they say!)
I wish for our fights to be fought the ways clouds moved on the sky that beautiful day, the child asked. 
Only the child wasn’t a child anymore, 
The child was asking to be a child for some more time
to be able to carry-on with the duties.
.
I gave you as much as I could, 
I’m sorry that the stories I offered to you were not as good as you might want them to be. 
I shared with you some knowledge, some passions to be developed.
I shared as much as I had to share, now I am doing what must be done to get myself out of here:
this state of mind that’s restless, this state of mind of the poor. 
I dared to create a character, I dared to believe in it. 
I dared to believe in myself and my fairness
and now I feel incomplete.
 .
- Are you having fun, keeping us like this, under your smart eye, she screamed. Is this funny to you, letting us get traumatised then traumatise us some more? 
- She is very angry, your girl!
.
- So cool!
.
- I am sorry to have taken you as an example! I am sorry to have even tried to take an example in life...
.
- So, how’s school? 
- School is fine! School is ... relaxing, as always. She smiled with faint sadness on her face. 
.
- I felt that I could be a part of it! 
.
- If it’s not one way then it will be the other! If it’s not under the cover of my face and body it will be under the cover of somebody else and still this justice I’m speaking of will be done one day!
.
- You are, I am, we all are, don’t worry... don’t get too far too early! Please! Only in time. 
- Prepare yourself for the battle of your life!
- I also felt the spirit helping, I loved every second of it, but then, when I found out what I was supposed to do... God, please, forbid. I cannot kill... I’d rather wait ...
- But in a war one’s forced to kill, and so they did! 
.
- Please live your after-life in peace and leave me alone!
.
- My brothers and sisters, we will fight together, no matter where we are, we’ll stick together as always. Let’s have as much fun as we can.
.
- So, I did the mistake of my life. We all do mistakes. It depends on how you wish to look at them.
.
- God, I was sure that I wanted to be happy but you convinced me somehow! Aren’t you brilliant! Aren’t I wrong?
.
- The garbage that speaks ill of you is the garbage that should be left behind! The garbage to forget about. Don’t ask me why! Please, do not ask why! Don’t care! Let’s just leave it out there, down there! Behind.
.
My own work, my own decisions, 
these tries of mine to hide-reveal, hide-then reveal
(myself) 
all seem to be against me, somehow, dear! Oh, dear!
My characters, my names and my pseudonyms, all scream, they scream... 
even the true and real ones want to be unreal;
What could I tell them now, Oh, dear! 
What could I possibly tell all of them no that I can see and hear what they all have to say? 
- Please, do learn, said a teacher, and try to be yourselves, as much as you all can. 
- Please, be who you are only better, 
Please be yourselves, the best ones ever!
Your kind and real supporter.
.
- A freaking example I found in this one! An example, I tell you! In him and her and a few others who actually did something with their lives. Be those pathetic or not!

- I will find you in books, in paintings, in music... you will live forever, in my heart, in history and arts, in stories and sciences. I will look for you forever... so help me God, she said. 
..
- To her some freaking rest would be awesome! 
- Some rest will be fine just not the kind of resting time you’d normally think of. 
.
- Why did you want me there, with you? why did you save me if the only thing that I was for you was junk? How much fun can you have doing this to someone who didn’t do the wrong a god is tempting her doing?
..
- I met with the wrong person, that’s all! No big deal! Some people get born in the wrong families! Now, that can end-up in a tragedy!” 
..
*Night-crawlers, night-killers of ugliness and evil, right.*
.

Did you find the truth you were looking for? 
Did you find the one? 
Did you try to realise something more than what you have become?

.
- Look! It’s the Artists’ Fault! The Artists’ Fault! ....
- Come and see! It is The Artist... The Artists’ Fault!.
- Come and see it! See the Artists’ Fault!
.
- Oh, and how we pay! How we pay for daring to say something, for impersonating, expressing... telling on you! - We’ve been telling on you!!! 
- Oh! How we pay! 
- How we pay!
For telling on you.
*
“These truth collectors! What can we do!?”
.
For as long as you can take it, dear! 
Only for as long as you can take it somewhere you don’t feel like belonging to.
.
For you I was a nobody, nobodies are always ignored, 
you don’t see me but I’m there, 
Helping you swallow the heavy stone in your throat. 
But nobodies care about nobodies, 
nobodies love nobodies, 
nobodies help nobodies.
..
Lost in time, trying to forget
about tragedies and motifs of murderous hells
brought back on earth, brought to the attention of our melodramatic minds, 
psychotic dreams start working the worlds that we combined 
in our heads, 
these minds of ours uniting, distracting the pages of journals and albums remained walking on two feet
to separate them from the hell of being locked in the dark-room of a photographer
or the cell of a dungeon, 
visiting the rooms of a palace to see, observe and be told
that some dreams really get to be born and reborn then lived;
this dark matter of the poet - complete!
.
Pages from a journal 

Once upon a time - because I must, you must, they should (start everything with a poem and or a formula of such kind for the sort of things we do) - there was this gypsy-girl who needed to be loved; Her skin too white for a gypsy, her teeth very well lined, a baby needing a tragedy to happen into her life so she could bring her gift out - the tragedy happened one day when someone left a set of toys, brushes and paints at her door with a note: “Please, take her to school!” - a warm warning from... a friend, lets say. Or for someone who’s just had enough seeing the misery and occasionally the pain some people still bring-up children into. This almost gave a heart-attack to gramps’ who wasn’t sure of such miracles but the mother was devastated. She couldn’t believe her eyes. The child picked-up a brush and handed it to her mother: - Take! ... Make! 
- You make! The mother said dimly refusing to be part of ‘the game’. The child took out a sheet of paper as if she knew what she was doing and started drawing lines. Strange a light poured out of the baby-girl and covering the grounds of her activities. Mother was more and more amazed; not only that she could not believe her eyes but she could not believe herself and the force with which she felt drawn by this pleasant warm light inviting her to see for herself: the miracle! Was right there in front of her, the little girl just drew a car that was well done for any child but for a baby-girl: a miracle! “So, I must! I must send her to school! But how!? An angel! An angel that was, sending her the materials! An angel that was leaving a note! I must find a way for her!” And so she did. 
A lovely story, you may say, but part of a situation that isn’t this great because there are boundaries, and many they are when not born in the ‘proper family’ around here. Hard a time to get everything that they needed to do as asked to and tough some times coming after because a past is something that can be very revengeful a thing, haunting pleasantly the ones who had it all from the very beginning and doing it with shameful pride of the very ugly and hateful who’d damage the miracle of losing ‘one of their preys’ in favour of the good life they never had the courage to make a sacrifice for. As if the three had any heaven to be taken away from! Their only heaven was their souls under the protection and love of  a thing superior to everything, a spirit not wishing for good souls to go through misery forever. A spirit asking for a sacrifice that’s possible to make for each and every one of us and which sweetens a bitter time, offers useful hopes by opening a window when a door gets shut... or finds another door to open, in case people stay to stick on their stiff grounds when probably not the case. As they tend to do that, so they usually do; it’s gravity’s fault, we all know it! No secret there. The mystery though remains the same for everyone: how did they know where to go and which door to knock at, where did they get all the materials and how to explain the inexplicable gift of the little gypsy-lady who was lucky to be found by a saint. 
The girls’ mother kept all the notes and the packages in a box. She spoke of memories she’d like to keep when asked about the reasons she had to do what she was doing, not losing any of the pieces of the ‘gifted puzzle’. That’s how the box was named after a while, when in the new apartment, clean and warm, they managed to get a TV set and watch their ‘first movie’. That was the title of an obscure film: ‘The gifted puzzle’ one in which the mother of a very gifted child could recognize herself and her family. Strange a fact, to see and feel that you belong, somehow, to the   lands and seas of places you don’t know yet but remember through flashbacks of memories someone else must have lived intensely there, when the picture got taken and the film conceived. 
A lot of time, a lot of energy... a lot of hopes paid for the adventure of this family that got itself protected by someone who wouldn’t give-up until a destiny changed. “Why should they live like that? Why not make a miracle happen instead! Why not let it reflect beautifully on the other side, like... we all wished it had!?” But the other side isn’t about miracles; the other side isn’t about living it beautifully but giving a hard time to everyone and we keep hoping and dreaming that this is not a harm done with the pleasure of doing any harm but with the wise precision of the old knowing that this way their people will appreciate the value of things, of their lives and their sacrifices, much more. Perhaps, one day, they’ll get to appreciate one another as the souls they are, more for the spirits they show and the goals they make use of the knowledge they gather and produce than for the families got born into and the money they have. 
Another day 
(two doors slammed! I have annoyed a neighbour. So, what!? I’ve been annoyed too by many ugly facts and acts of ‘kindness’)
.
 Expect me to trust you, 
see if I can, 
maybe you’re also curious why, my fake friend. 
Just when did you actually give a damn!? 
.
It was all just about doing business with you, that’s all! 
.
“It seems to me that he likes seeing the gibbons ruining his life everywhere! It seems to me that he doesn’t want them to change a little, or a little more!  - Now that’s a change I’d love to see around here! I’m tired of the place where people are not dignified with their quality of the human they tend to be and keep on working on being! I’m sick and tired of you showing us the little ants we are compared to you! I’m tired of being shown that I don’t belong anywhere because you don’t belong anywhere either! I’m tired of being at the mercy of those who have no mercy!  Asking to make a sacrifice that’s supposed to be made for something and someone else than you imply, realizing that the sacrifice is universal and that, in the end, the stronger fighter wins, no matter what! We need those angels of justice! I want those angels to come back and crush the ones who are getting on my nerves this time with their ugly superiority! I accepted their business terms! It is time for them to respect mine!”  
.A second other day
“How do you feel God? Knowing that somebody else can do with a soul of yours what they want and take pride on that!? Aren’t they free enough!? Weren’t they too proud to spit it to my face, showing their superiority in front of you and your armies? Weren’t they too arrogant a thing throwing dust in our eyes? I thought that I felt the same as you did! I thought Your wrath was my wrath, your justice was my justice! Your good sane pride mine. Was I wrong?” I recall the day I was more of a young and foolish thing to ask this sort of questions as if any god would stand in a child that never learned how to crush all her demons forever and use them as puppets in her shows... isn’t that a payback to look nice as it lights-up a space properly, evenly hanged on the wall?
A third other day
I feel more disappointed at myself than ever. Last night I felt that it was my fault the quarrel started by two friends who didn’t have a clue what they were talking about or doing. I suppose that I have to have a fault of some sort, otherwise things wouldn’t look down and back at me the way they do. A fault of some sort we all have to carry on with. Unless we want ourselves dead and buried, which can be... well... I do feel buried under a pile of talking and sometimes yelling leafs. I just wish for myself never to last for more than the minute needed to do the right thing as a leaf of this kind. Ugh! I tend to make myself sick, all the time, with nonsense of this kind! Perhaps it is the breakfast I didn’t have or the try to lie to my stomach that it had enough to eat already... one must be more useful to the world and not too much of a consumer, does he? (she?) 
A fourth other day
I feel as if I lost everything. By the kindness of the Universe  and the stubbornness I got invested with, by the grace of God and the mercy of His angels, by the faith I kept digging for and the tears I shed, I was granted permission to say something, do something... be the way, I have to admit, I kind of am. Not complete but feeling more and more well paced and doing the right thing. It’s not always comfortable doing what’s right. Not when your heart tells you to jump out of bed and runaway like a crazy fool because... there’s no reason to be afraid of anything and anyone (as if I wasn’t well trained and informed!). I’ll either become the invincible amazing robot or I’ll have to find a decent way for myself to rot. 
..
The perfect traveler, I am,
With kindness carried all the way 
up and down. 
I’m learning how to make a living and get myself moving around,
For the purposes that I had
still linger in my mind as a thought 
that’s possible to make come true. 
It’s only an illusion, one little act of kindness and mercy! 
.
Please, forgive me, if this seems wrong to you! 
To me it was the nicest way of offering an alternative
to saying: Thank you! 
.
Many days of nonsense followed, 
many of new hopes and dreams, 
many stories told to be re-told, untold figures
dancing in the air;
spoken wishes to our families above.
.
 Only this one counting, the one following, 
a page in  the history of every woman or man, 
A page in the history of every child
living a life that’s heavenly shaped no matter where you’re going, 
no matter what you’re saying, 
because you know what to say and to whom, because you know how to share
the beautiful things and aspects of your kind: the kind.
.
Be beautiful like heaven forever and shine like a burning star! 
.
One of those days ...
// Apathy doesn’t mean happiness. Waiting for that day when you’ll have the heart and state of mind to enjoy your life again is not even close to happiness... not to speak about the perfect environment or the perfect tools and means of coming-up with a trave0-llogue. We are all travelers in our own ways... please, pardon these errors... I meant on our own ways which will prove to be the ways others have already lived a plentiful life. 
I’m in a state of monumental steadiness caught on the move; my soul, anaestetised so I felt no pain at the waking of my self crushed in a battle led last night with some host that was so deep into a darkness that I cannot remember the battlefield or the fight itself; I can only feel what’s left of the battle: some muscles well toughened and strong now. You cannot defeat me! You cannot beat me now, you monster! I’m not a weak child anymore! I am, perhaps, the one blessed with the power of going on even if... embarrassing a placement under the eyes that have fun on the expense of our suffering, on the expense of our, more or less, childish events and goals. 
This gift of mine! Sometimes feeling as a blessing other times as if a curse fell down on me. Sometimes I just feel like running away! I beg for anger, then, I beg for sorrow to feed me so I got something else out of the bitterness I remember having us awake and able for putting a fair price on everything and learn about the value of a saint purpose in life. 
I hear some friends telling me that they gave me the purpose in life, that I had nothing before them... then how come my purposes and wishes come from darker eras of ignorance of one another existence; times when we didn’t know each-other but dreamed of meeting one another and see what we can get out of this holy discrepancy of products dropped in the world so we learned better about the best and how to get to be the best... the elite.. the... what am I writing about? 
The only day that counts
   I am the night and met the day. At our meeting a brand new species of skies emerged but it only lasts for too short a time of transition to be given the importance it has. The way it feels though expands the limits of our imagination and the one of our feelings’ power to reach another soul and influence a mind working on its own at a time when nothing speaks about the space you don’t want to spend your entire existence in more than your hurting and very hurtful spirit. 
I met the night when I was the day and when I became the night I had to meet the one who was instead the day. Just like a goddess meets the eyes of a god now and she acknowledges him as her god! They can shine the way they choose... together they will shine for quite a while! 
   I have chosen to finish a story that is asking for me to have what it takes to make it happen... It’s a beautiful one, gathering a whole world, actually! But I have to put some kind of an end to an era making me feel less than I was able to accomplish. It is not for my own good, yet it is. It didn’t start as a thing done for myself included but now, with the passage of each minute, I kind of fear that it was done a little for myself too, for my hubris’s hunger. I let myself driven by a current and now... The day met the Night and the night was holding excruciating fires inside ready to spit themselves out on the fuses to be lit in the memory of those someones who left but kept being always dear to us! The night burned and brought out to daylight a different type of energy, another type of fun, the product of a new sun. 
   There they were, I could see them!
   It’s a She&Him story, of course, due to the limitations of my own traumatized and traumatising self not being capable of accepting that He is going to live without Her forever; - It can’t be! My self’ would revolve and revolt! He has a duty! He’ll always have one! It’s in his nature, be it to write a poem or a story and history itself! He needs Her! Without her his exile will be completely useless! A complete waste of time and resource; a waste of self! He must live with her, even if not together in the common acceptance of the term! He must remember Her and cherish her presence, acknowledge her beauty and accept his own. She will always be part of his soul, no matter what! As He will always be part of Her soul, They may choose to live the lives of those who have nothing to lose; they may choose to lose it all so they gained something else in return. They may think themselves gay, for a while, they may think themselves straight: deep down inside they’ll both know that they belong to one another, as one spirit unites them for the same love of gold, the same passions, the same goals. That precious gold-mine from which they’ll always extract the beauty and polish to make believe and reach deep down those souls they can truly love for what they’ve earned: the liberty to do what they want. Consequences? Perhaps, if their deeds won’t bring ravenous confusing blades cutting down the trees of life breathing for life.
   Perhaps it is too late for me to think about being saved or establishing the grounds for my own happiness - already got to this conclusion. I kept feeling that I was dedicated a song, an old one, saying that I must have left a long time ago! That I didn’t know the right time. Saying I was pathetic and funny enough a thing in the world not knowing how to keep a spirit intact and follow with the stubbornness of a bull, the cleverness of a wolf and the wit of a fox the best instructions for me to built the roads and bridges we need for our New Rom, so we had a chance to a fair revival. “Once upon a time...” there was ... there is... there will (always) be... something left to show, to tell about, to be taught and to learn.”
.
They were there, into the light of the sun keeping all the beautiful nostalgia safe, taking one precious memory after another out to evenly share with the individuals chosen and with the kindness deserved or needed - to each and every one a precious gift of this kind. I felt blessed with being chosen to chose what I wanted to do! I felt illuminated by the power of such great love that nobody and nothing can destroy, not even love itself, not even God. It’s got out of His hands, so to speak. And true love is true, and it’s love; you cannot really think of it in any other way! It grinds and it moves things, it dances and struggles to make itself survive in a good heart like nothing else! They were there, together, two friends who have forgotten about the nightmares of any evil brotherhood asking to kill one another, asking to commit acts of betrayal towards the beauty in human nature thus betraying human kind itself. They were there, two students, brilliantly bathing into the (sun)light that’s been halved for two camps sharing the same beliefs: to live that magic of a healing power beyond any imagination, beyond any reason... beyond and far away from any traumatic event.
One nice memory
Her place used to smell like coffee and cherry-syrups and jam. We used to go there and play in her garden until tea-time, when freshly baked cookies and biscuits, cup-cakes and little home-made snacks, created with her own hands, were waiting for us on a round table on which rested the most flavoured teas that she could ever make of all the plants in her gardens and the best lemonades. Too bad sometimes we were allowed to have those warm, the lemonades - hot days we are talking about, when an ice-cube or two won’t make a difference, that hot! But she was getting herself prepared for each year to bring more freshness and more fruity lemonades and pies. God, those pies! I’m such a child, right now, wishing for a pie like that to be served to me the very same way, in the very same garden by the very same spirit who was more than happy to be where she was, not by someone who got forced to do this for a while so she’d get off to the times and places she’d feel comfortable with. Around here. everybody is unsatisfied with the choices the skies made for them: they all seem to have lost their paths, their happiness... They all must remember that they were either more or on their ways of being more than what they actually are; a bunch of people forced into getting a job that doesn’t seem to fulfill any of their other needs but the monetary one. Only that won’t bring them back their lost souls; now, what to do when you don’t have a soul anymore? When you don’t guide yourself according to the reasonable concepts of human reality and start thinking yourself a god among nobodies without knowing where you’re heading to because the many slice and cut pieces of you as if a loaf of bread? 
I want to relive a moment like that, a moment sweet and innocent. I want into that garden where I can have a hot lemonade full of fruit and where, if I dare to say a word against it, the lady would just cut me with one of her sharp -bladed words inviting me to leave it on the table if not satisfied and find a better one wherever I’d be asked to pay for it a price that would be fair and gather loads of tired-to-be-themselves-or-somebody-else faces with which to make-up a beautiful story and sell it for some real money. If only that would buy her more ice-cubes!
..
..
I wish I could feed with pure light like saints do!

They cry and they cry-out,
their desperate voices, tired fights, their evil crawls because they can, 
they have nothing else to do for us, for them; 
they move and change, they change nothing and everything;
feeling okay

If you still want they can show gratitude asking for more hopes offering hopes, 
dreams of opportunities and crawling tears.
They cry and they cry-out their possible lives, 
all lived and left behind. 
They curse an ideal, that is why they will live high! 
When we cry we want our hearts to shine above all people,

You were all just simple thoughts to me, in the very beginning of what you, so beautifully,
exquisitely and most wonderfully kept searching a name for and found:
TIME
  






















Stage requirements
.
1. the possibility of creating a rotating pyramid on which sides
to be projected various short scenes.
(darkness falls after 3 to 4 slow spins/rotations)
2. inside the pyramid
we have only the skeleton of the pyramid where something is happening: a scene of your choice;
a story told:
a). a monologue;
b). a dialogue;
c). a story told to a group of people around a lantern/light;
outside the pyramid there can be rain happening.
*the small introduction gets swallowed by a great white light coming from the lantern*
**spectators should be given protection glasses during the show/**
3. From a burst of flickering light
(yellow-bright-white_yellow-bright-white)
a character appears.
she/he starts singing
(duplicated visually with the help of a panel- a shadow, first)
(then, as if made of light waves, a human figure)
*if we have as first character a woman then a man is to be brought on the stage*
**if the opposite... well, do the opposite**
The other character interprets parts of the rhythmical writing in a theatrical way.
*opera insertions*
**pamphlet**
***classic interpretations***
****comedy and tragicomedy****
*****drama interpretations*****
*******joining on the stage the first character for a duet*****

(at the end of the duet, the same light that brought them on the stage will surround them as darkness falls)
(a dream-like music: expressing the origin of life ???)
(approx. a minute of darkness where light-bugs creatures appear to entertain the public)
*complete darkness - price: 20 to 30 sec.*
4. The stage gets progressively illuminated:one corner: one tear-like suspended chair in which a conversation takes place;
another corner: the same thing;
a third corner: an third interaction(perhaps with the public)
*they are logically inter-connected, they seem to offer answers to one another, these corners*
**at times they get broken, the logic, the connections and the answers become absurd**
(a lack of an answer giving some space, at times)
***a come-back of logic gets reestablished (funny, entertaining-way preferred)***
~ irony and sarcasm seen as saviours of the world which falls into a short time of blackness, noisily ~
the crash brings-up another moment on the stage, this time completely illuminated.
5. The cubes.
We can see all the cubes but nothing moves and more light is projected on the active cube
(in the first half of this part)
*
the second part gets all mixed-up[…]
half of the stage is progressively thrown into darkness; this darkness will dance around the stage to let light reveal the real source of the words spoken.
cubes where nothing is happening but is expected to happen are put into the light;
from cubes where no light is cast, conversations start;

the initially lighted cubes get progressively left behind by the source of light that’s looking for the real speakers.
*
by the time we get to see which cube is active, activity there stops and some other cube that’s found into darkness becomes active; the light follows its course of slow progressive search.
(in the end all cubes are shown in a state of motionless-active-pose)
(light and darkness play the thunder prediction)
*thunder falls unexpectedly, right before our public gets bored*
**out of the darkness falling, little blue light-bugs appear**
(the opposite of the natural light-bugs in the beginning -?-)
***the light-bugs start growing; from little blue spheres they turn into large spheres***
****inside these spheres uncertain activity is seen****
6. The Spheres
(one by one, the spheres are brought in front of the stage)
(the ones left in the background are mostly silent)
*sometimes the spheres in the background play the role of a choir*
(from each sphere a human or human-like creature tries to escape)
*only an angel manages to get out from one of the spheres*
**he/she is dancing around creating a tornado-spiral of all the spheres, moving faster and faster**
***the dance ends with the angel in the center, taken by one sphere turning into a tear-chair***
(the angel rests on that chair that’s lifted up, above the other spheres that go down)
***one by one, the spheres get broken and their trapped characters get out***”
“**the angel’s face: sad, looking down to watch them all getting out of their spheres and dance together**
(dance among great waves of blue light coming from a burst of energy provoked by the breaking spheres)
(all dancers start asking for the angel to come down for them)
(the angel is taken higher and higher)
(the dancers show great sadness and despair)
(the angel fades into the darkness above)
(the dancers fall down and weep, some faint)
(a dark couple dances among all the victims of sadness)
(their final pose brings the angel back down)
*only as pure light*
The stage is illuminated brightly.
(special glasses needed for the public eye)
we can hear drops of rain, wind playing in the trees of all seasons,
sea-waves and birds singing,
crickets and the joy of children playing happily;
we hear soft music bringing back the physical world the public is used with.
The stage is empty on a panel that fades away while each character is brought back to life by the simple pass-by of the angel.
All characters bow in front of the public form the very place they were found and resurrected.
7. The cubo-spheres
The panel is brought back in front of the stage.
Projections of cubo-spheres evolving appear;
they start growing life inside:
moments in a cafeteria, moments in a battle (with pillows?), a city-life-event, a festive moment, a casual life-event,
nothing special, a glimpse at an office activity, a job done by a worker, a bike, a police-man and a few pedestrians crossing a street, a day in a park, a day of holiday etc.
8. The end
(while these moments are still rolling)
The panel gets broken by a first character, then all the others follow.


*** Another idea is to place some of the characters in hammocks or in cocoon-like constructions from where they can perform their disrupted communication acts.

Optional additives:
.
1. The show can benefit from an extension: perhaps a short artistic musical moment (dance of the kind the director chooses);
.
2. The show may have multiple extensions: parts that weren’t used can find an interpretation and those that were used re-interpreted in a completely different manner;
.
3. A short movie can be made of one or two descriptive moments at a choice then a follow created, on the spot, on a stage: an improvisation;
.
4. The event (if a choice to make an event of it) can end with beverage and snacks taken among artworks like paintings and craft-work, sculptures and photographs and human paintings and sculptures, occasionally interacting with the participants.

**
The end that’s to be marked by a form of lights-show may be interrupted by a group of actors going wild among the participants, taking some of them for a short dance or a spin then picking one live-human-art and runaway with it waving goodbye.
