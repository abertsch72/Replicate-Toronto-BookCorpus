Writing Prompt #1 — Premature Sale
Prompt: You want to sell your soul to the devil, but you find out your parents already did when you were a baby. You must now sort it out with underworld collections.

“Finally!” I said to myself, as the line moved forward and I became second-in-line. My hands in my pockets, I glanced around the dingy room that was Underworld Collections.

Half of the lights were burnt out; the white tiled ceiling had yellowed spots, reminding me of urine; and the floor tiles were cracked, large, jagged chunks broken off.

Along the far wall were dozens of torn cushioned seats, each seating an abhorrent creature that even the best horror writers couldn’t conjure. I thought Lovecraft’s work was horrifying… Jesus, he knew nothing of true, utter, horror.

Monstrosities sealed below Earth’s surface, things that never seen the light of day, some creatures so pale and transparent, others brilliantly colored with gold and silver and seemed to transcend humanity, living in some sort of fourth dimension; others travelling from the outskirts of space, others from a place without time or space, some with enormous, tendril wings, and so on… I could go on forever describing the abominations.

The thing ahead of me moved aside, and at last, I was next. I shuffled to the moldy counter, and peered through the opening in the spider webbed glass. A heap of flesh met my gaze, or at least, I believed it did. It had no eyes, no mouth, and endlessly rippled, mounds of yellow-black skin continuously rolling over itself. 

“Uh, yes, hi. My parents sold my soul before I was born, and I’d like to have their sale transferred over to me. I’m eighteen now, so I’m legally — well, legally in the States — allowed to have it… So, can I have that done?”

Silence. Not a moan, groan, or a word came from the thing on the other side. After a few moments, as frustrating grew, a large stack of forms fell from the ceiling in front of me. Without pondering how they came to be, I flipped through them quickly, finding that it was at least a hundred pages long. A pen fell on top of them shortly after.

“So I need to fill this out? When is this due?”

Again, not a word, but a date burnt itself into the papers. They were due by tomorrow.

“Tomorrow!” I shouted. “How the hell am I going to do that?”

Silence.

“For fuck’s sake… Fine, whatever. Can I take a seat over there and do this? Great, fine, thanks.”

And so, for the next twenty some-odd hours, I sat in an uncomfortable chair, hunched over, and scribbled away. The next day, I waited in line for another five hours, and finally handed over the forms. I was then told by another sheet of paper that I would receive a letter in the mail with the results within one thousand business days.

Truly, it was hell.





























Writing Prompt #5 — Angels’ Haste
Prompt: God is gone. What angels remain are out of a job.

He wrapped his muscular arms under my arms, lifting me from the ground, and we were off. Raised into the sky, the wind whipping me, I peered between my dangling feet to see the city rush underneath us in a gray blur. This wasn’t the first time I rode with Angels’ Haste, but I never got used to flying. Beyond the angel’s shining frame, two enormous, brilliant wings flapped. To break the monotony, I asked him a question.

“How’d you get started doin’ this?”

He said in a hollow, but soothing voice. “Many years ago, we did not have to perform such acts. We worked for a mighty man, a man named God, Jesus to some. He was the King of everything and everyone, a gracious, kind, forgiving man. However, as time went, belief in Him dwindled, nearly vanishing completely. How can a King rule without His people? And thus when there were not any more believers, no more to worship Him, He left. I do not know where He went, nor do I know even if He is still alive.”

The angel sighed, continued. “We, the angels, the servants of God, had nowhere to go, nothing to do. We were faithful to the very end, but what were we to do once our God abandoned us? Heaven was no longer a place of pure bliss, it became vacant, desolate, the warmth it possessed left with Him. Thus, after much time of deciding, we came up with the idea of Angels’ Haste. We could help those who need it, without Him, and be given something to do while we wait.”

“Wait for what?”

“For His return, of course. He returned before, and I believe, we all believe, He will return again. We do not know when or how He will return, but in our hearts, in our very soul, we believe He will. Thus, as we wait, we do this, carry men and women from one place to another with the gift He gave us.”

We were descending, my hair pressing against my forehead, and my shirt pushing up my stomach. The skyscrapers passed by, and the millions of windows became a blinding white. Down on the sidewalks and streets hundreds of people scurried around like ants.

Seconds later, I stood on the ground, straightening my shirt. The angel kept afloat with his wings, his silver hair bobbing with his movements.

“So how much do I owe ya’?”

“Nothing, nothing at all, sir. But what I ask of you is to pray. Pray to Him for His return, and through this, I will be paid for my services.”

“Alright bud, I’ll do that. Thanks for the ride, have a good one.” I said, waving while turned and walked away. I heard the whooshing of his wings behind me and when I glanced back, he was gone. I had no intention of praying, little good it did in the past, so why do it now? Plus, Angels’ Haste beats taking a taxi any day.
































Writing Prompt #6 — Death’s the Cure
Prompt: People have stopped dying. Scientists can’t figure out why. You are a priest who has just graduated from seminary. You find Death terrified and hiding in the darkest corner of creation.

I couldn’t believe my eyes. It was one thing to hear about him, but another to see him, albeit trembling in a corner of an old monastery in the middle of nowhere. But it was him, from his bone feet to his shadowy black cloak.

“Hello?” I said, lowly.

He had his head shoved into the corner, and from the sound of it, he was weeping. He wiped his face with his arm, then whispered, “Hello.”

I wiped the dust from the front pew and sat, setting my hands together on my lap. “What’re you doing here?”

“What do you mean?” He snapped.

“Well, you’re death, the Death. Aren’t you supposed to be out collecting souls, or something like that?”

“Who’re you to tell me what I’m supposed to be doing, Priest? Yes, I know of you, I know of everyone who lives. But that’s all worthless now, isn’t it? You’ve read the paper; you’ve seen on your precious television.” The words were as if they seeped out his bones in a stream of tar.

I remembered the front page, and any news station you turned to, covering the same story: People stopped dying. They couldn’t explain it, nor could the scientists, but it happened. The video recordings of people jumping from bridges, staying underwater for hours, setting themselves on fire, and so on. None of them died, none of them could die.

I never became curious to take my own life, but perhaps I was less masochistic than the masses. Regardless, if people weren’t meant to die, it was God’s way.

“Yes,” I said. “I’ve seen. People can’t die, do you know why?” 

“No, of course I don’t. Why would I know that Priest? I’m the Collector of Souls, the Bringer of the Dead, the Reaper! You want answers like that, ask your Lord.”

I ignored his vehemence. “Why were you crying, just now?”

“I wasn’t crying, merely sleeping.”

“Are you certain, Death? I could swear that I hear—”

He leapt to his feet, standing nearly eight feet tall, and looked down upon me through the gloom within his hood. His skeletal face was a distance in the shadows within, but I caught a fiery where his eyes would be. The cloak’s hem rippled like water, and swayed on the stone floor as if it had life of its own. If he would’ve had his scythe, I probably would’ve soiled my clothes.

“I was not crying, flesh-bag. Sleeping, I was sleeping.” Black fog rolled out from the gloom, dissipating above him.

I patted the seat next to me. “Why don’t you sit down, and talk to me about this whole mess? Even if you weren’t crying — which you weren’t, of course — it sounds like you need someone to talk to. I’m a good listener.”

He seemed beside himself, and he started fidgeting. He wanted to vent, but at the same time, he was Death, not some priest’s parish. At last he came to a decision, and floated to the pew and sat next to me, sending small tufts of billowing smoke around him.

“It’s just,” he began, “what am I supposed to do if no one is dying? My whole existence is to collect souls and bring them to where they need to go… Well except for the good ones, those are out of my hands, but the others, those are my territory. But now no one is dying, no one is getting sick, no one is doing anything but living their damn lives. What about me? I was born into this and now it’s irrelevant. I cannot start anew, I cannot begin to collect lively souls, I cannot do anything of the sort.”

“Maybe it’ll change?”

“Doubtful, Priest. Once He has decided, it’s usually forevermore… Unless humans create something that can kill themselves off, but why would they do that? They already have a million things that can kill them, even the stuff they drink and eat kill them! If nothing now does the trick, what could possibly do it?”

“Bombs?” I said, dumbly.

“You people have bombed countries, and some people still live to this day. God I hate to see what your planet is like in a year or two with all the war that’s going to occur. If no one can die, the next war will be endless.”

I mulled over some thoughts. “What don’t you go to another planet? I’ve heard there’s life elsewhere in the cosmos.”

“Maybe, but they're not human yet. I’d have to wait millions of years for them to get to the point you are at now, and even then, do they even have souls? It’s a big risk to invest time and travel to another planet to find that they don’t have souls.”

“Have you tried killing the people yourself? You know, the bad ones of course: the rapists, the pedophiles, and so on.”

Death looked up, as if staring off into a vista I couldn’t see. “You know…” he began, “you might be right. Maybe— but aren’t you a priest, a man of God? Shouldn’t you be teaching peace and love and acceptance?”

He was right, but also wrong. “I believe those who do hellish acts upon innocent victims should be punished… You’re the cure for it. Perhaps the only way for those to die, is to be killed by Death himself.”

He leapt to his feet, whipped around, and grabbed my hand. His fingers were solid like marble, and sent a chill up my arm, settling into my chest. The world became dark, numb. My head felt heavy, as if filled with mortar, and my lungs crackled when I tried to breathe. 

“Shit,” Death muttered, and released my hand. Life came fluttering back.

“Sorry, but thank you. That has to be it, I must be the one who kills them. Life is the disease and my scythe is the cure. Now I must be off, hopefully you’re right Priest.”

The cloak’s ends twisted, spiraling into the air, and formed a malformed portal. In a piercing echoing pop, he vanished into it. And that was the last time I saw him, though it wasn’t the last I heard of him.

The following morning, as I sat in my kitchenette and drank coffee, there were dozens of reports of people being beheaded. They couldn’t explain how it was happening, or who was doing it, but it was happening. I smiled and whispered, “You’re welcome.”


Writing Prompt #7 — Vampiric Retail
Prompt: You’re a vampire that works in retail so you know who deserves to die.

“Can you get me that one, on the top shelf?” The heavy-set woman asked from her electric wheelchair.

“Yes, not a problem.” I said, scaling two of the shelves to reach the top. The toy squeaked as I grabbed it. I pulled it down, and held it out to the woman.

“Not that one. That one!” She shouted, pointing with her pudgy finger, a curtain of flesh hanging from her arm. The faint blue tint of her veins pumping through the fat was tempting, but my annoyance overcame my desire for a drink.

“Oh, my apologies miss, hold on.” Again I climbed the shelves, shoved the toy back, and grabbed the other. As I pulled it down, I realized it was exactly the same, except it was pink instead of blue. Could a dog notice the difference? And if so, would it even care?

I held it out to her. “Is this the one you wanted, miss?”

I could tell from the way her brow furrowed and her folds wrinkled over her forehead, that this was not what she wanted. Another one of these people, I thought.

“No! That’s not the one I want, jackass! I want that one! That one right there! Next to the blue one, the green one! Do you even know how to do your damn job?”

After I apologized profusely, I repeated the same act as before, and held out the green squeaky toy. And of course, this was not the one she wanted… 

“Jesus H. Christ! Can’t you tell colors? Have you ever seen something green? That toy is yellow, not green! God, how could someone like you get a job here? This place used to have standards, but not anymore! Screw it! I’m going home!” She slapped her hand down onto the handle that made the wheelchair move, then she left.

I watched her drive down the aisle, and followed her to the sliding glass doors. She stopped by a van parked in the front handicap spot. The night sky was starless and the only light around was the sodium parking lot lamps.

*

“Do you need any help getting into your vehicle, miss?” I asked, appearing behind her.

She jumped and jerked to find me standing nearby, my arms behind my back. Her door already partially open, her sausage fingers gripping the metal handle attached to the van’s exterior. 

“No, I don’t need any damn help from the likes of you. I can do it on my own, I’m an American and I can do anything anyone else can do, especially get in my own damn car you son-of-a-bitch.”

Silently I watched her struggle and use every ounce of strength to wrench herself from the wheelchair and into her front seat. Sweat stood out on every portion of her, and veins enlarged in her neck. I licked my lips.

She slammed the door shut, reversed out of the space, and drove away.

*

“Do you know that what I held was actually, indeed, green and not yellow? And did you know that I do well at my job, save for those incompetent few who spew stupidity in such degrees it can drive a person to kill?” I asked, appearing in the passenger seat of her van. She drove on the highway, no other vehicles for miles. I was thankful it was the middle of the night on a weekday.

“Jesus Christ! How’d you get— Get out of my damn car you freak!”

“I will, please pull over.”

She did.

Before she realized what was happening, I leaned over the center console, and stretched open my jaw. My fingers punctured her neck, tasting like biting into an old tired. But the taste is not what I longed for, it was the blood and I drank, oh, did I drink.

Blood gushed over my lolling tongue like water breaking through a dam. Down my throat, into my stomach, where it sloshed like rum in a glass.

I drank until I could no longer. Euphoria flooding my senses. My expanding mind seemed to reach the cosmos.

I smelt the roadkill fifty miles away, saw a deer grazing in the high grass a hundred miles beyond that. I clenched my fingers, released a gasp of air, and allowed myself an orgasm — thankfully, we, the Undead, do not produce semen or my work uniform would’ve been soiled.

The lady passed during my drink, which I was grateful for. I didn’t want to deal with her cries of ecstasy and pain after I finished.

“Goodbye, miss.” I whispered, setting a green squeaky toy onto her dashboard, and vanished.

*

I left the staff lounge’s bathroom, my black hair pulled back, my face and mouth washed, and entered the retail fray once more.

I walked the aisles until I heard a question from behind. Turning, I found a heavy-set man, sitting in an electric wheelchair, asking for me to get him a toy from the top shelf.

“Which color would you like, sir? Yellow or green?” I said, smiling.






















Writing Prompt #9 — The Cute One, CutyPy'th
Prompt: There is the Old One, the Great One, the Many Angled One, the Sleeping One and then there is you, the Cute One.

“...And then there is you, the Cute One.” The Judge said, pointing at me with his splayed skeletal finger.

“Wha— What do I do?” I squeaked.

“You, CutyPy’th, dwell in the unnamed land beyond Gumdrop Valley in the Crystal Candy Tower, atop its highest peak, among the bubblegum clouds and licorice lightning. The Tower stands far from the S'mores Forest and Hot Cocoa Sea, far from the reaches of anyone or anything. You wait there to be summoned by an unknowledgeable child.”

I waddled forward to the Judge’s monolithic Stand, baby ducks quacked, little sheep baa-ed, and kittens meowed with each step. “Then what?” I whispered, gripping the cold stone, standing on tiptoes, peering into the gloom covering the Judge’s face.

“Then you go to them. You ride upon your mighty rainbow speckled unicorn, tear through the skies as if they were paper, and rip open a portal to the child’s lair. Upon entering, you push the child’s sanity into the abyss of mania.”

A silence fell over the room. The Old One sat in its mound of ash and dust, its six eyes closed while steams of sand poured over its eyelids; the Great One in its mountainous chair looked out into the vast distance, seemingly peering at something we couldn’t possibly see; the Many Angled One hovered in the air, its thin crystal frame twisted, turning, transforming itself into a new geometric shape every moment, possessing no eyes, nor mouth; and the Sleeping One, the Old One’s sibling, covered in soot and charred debris, lay upon a bed throne covered in rubble, loudly snoring.

“Then what do I do?” I asked, my high-pitched voice shattering the silence.

“Once the child is manic, lost in a haze of happiness and joy and giggles and smiles, you return to your lair atop Crystal Candy Tower. You wait for another child to summon you, then repeat the cycle. Between summons you can do whatever you like, as the unnamed land beyond Gumdrop Valley is yours to do with as you wish.”

I bit my top lip, furrowed my fuzzy brow, and nodded. I turned away from the Judge, ripped open a pink portal, sparkling with shimmering stars and multicolored marshmallows, and leapt in.

I was a god, an Old God, and I was to serve my duty in the universe, one child at a time.



































Writing Prompt #12 — A Superhero’s Lament
Prompt: You are a superhero. Unfortunately, there are no super villains, so you just kinda use your powers to make your life easier.

Up at 7 AM once again. At the speed of light, I go from the bed into the bathroom, shower, shave, and shit; then, to the dresser, grab my clothes, put them on; teleport to the kitchen and cook steaks and eggs, devour them within seconds; then outside, in the air, flying towards some random location overseas I’ve picked out just to bid my time with.

Every day’s the same, without a challenge, a real purpose. Even chores done within milliseconds, they’re still chores. I have the powers of a god but don’t have an enemy to slay or battle. Life feels endless, which it might be — I’m not sure how long I live, maybe thousands, if not millions of years. I’m the sole proprietor of my species, the rest choosing not to travel from Planet QX to Earth. I vividly remember the day I told them I was going to travel across the milky way and the solar system to planet Earth. They all looked at me like I was an idiot… I guess they were right.

My Creators tried to convince me to stay, ensuring me that there was nothing there for me but never-ending boredom. At first I would be excited with a place entirely new, from the grass to the ocean, to the sky to the sun, but soon I would become stagnant. There weren’t monsters to fight in the sand valleys, there weren’t atrocities dwelling underneath the ground waiting to be vanquished in the catacombs of our ancestors, there weren’t challenges or diversities to face and grow from. There was utterly nothing worthwhile.

Well… I didn’t listen and shot across the span of space and arrived on Earth a few minutes later. It was wonderful. The sights of the mountains, the deep blue of the oceans, the technological inventions, and advancements. Most humans were attractive and beautiful, so pleasing to look at it and be among. But, after a week of traveling from one city to the next, to one country to another, everything started blurring together. People were essentially the same around the world, maybe different colored or had different body shapes, but when broken down, the same.

So I took to fighting crime, but runaway robbers were no match, mass shooters trembled beneath the sheer weight of my fist, even terrorists threatening catastrophic destruction were wiped out with a flick of the wrist. The world soon settled into peace and there were hardly any crimes or wars happening. The leaders of each country thanked me, praised me for my work, and throughout each ceremony as I idly stood, daydreaming, I wanted to scream into the roaring crowd: “I only did this because I was bored!”

I land somewhere in Asia, on top of a mountain that hides in a blanket of clouds. It’s snowing but thanks to my adaptive blood, I don’t feel cold. I find a rock jutting out of the whiteness and sit. I rest my head on my hand and stare into the foggy landscape. After a couple of hours, some hikers trek up the mountainside with pulleys and ropes and large bags filled with gear.

They ask for an autograph. Before they come close enough with a crumpled piece of paper and pen in their shaking hands, I take flight and go to another random location.

“Ugh,” I murmured. “Maybe I'll return home…”

































Writing Prompt #14 — Vanishing Metal
Prompt: All metal suddenly ceases to exist.

The vibrations from the massive speakers on the stage shook the ground, the rafters, the entire building Slayer performed in. Men and women ran in a circle in the center of the floor, pushing, shoving, banging their heads, and throwing the devil’s sign into the air. Others in the crowd watched as Kerry King broke into the second guitar solo of “Raining Blood.” The song was reaching its peak and everyone felt the energy swelter, swelling, building. 

Here.
It.
Com—

Before the audiences’ wide eyes, Slayer had disappeared. Not only the band, but their instruments and speakers as well. Stillness crashed over the crowd like a wave. For a few moments they all stopped and stared aimlessly at the empty stage. Then there was screaming and shouting and cursing, hordes of metal fans rushed the stage to search for their favorite band while others sprinted out from the suffocatingly warm building into the parking lot.

Most took out their phones and checked Facebook, to find not only had Slayer disappeared but so did Metallica, Pantera, Hatebeed, Sepultura, Cannibal Corpse, Six Feet Under… Every metal band in the world had vanished.

A teenage boy with gauged ears and a septum piercing dumbly looked around at the people in the parking lot and asked: “Now what?”














Writing Prompt #22 — A Death Date
Prompt: You’re a horror movie victim who has been avoiding death by telling the monster that you’re “busy” and that you “have plans.” Today, the monster confronts you at lunch, determined to schedule a convenient murder date.

I read the newspaper and ate my chicken salad out on the patio of Marco’s Eats, the warm, summer breeze wafting over me. My cell phone rang and, putting down the paper, I picked it up and saw it was the same dumb, annoying person from before. I set down my phone, and picked up the paper again.

I went to take another bite when someone sat in the chair across from me. He was more of a thing than a person, and his deep-seated, dark green eyes gleamed under the sunlight. He looked normal out in the open, but I knew when night fell his true, ugly form would be revealed.

“You’ve been dodging my calls,” he said, flatly.

“Well I’ve been busy. I have a life, you know.”

“You’re avoiding the problem here, and you know it.”

“I’m sorry,” I said sarcastically, “but I don’t think not wanting to die is a problem.”

“It’s a problem to me, and you know that. Every other person lets it happen quickly, but you… God, you’ve been the worst. You’ve managed to avoid it once, twice, then a third time, and now miraculously your schedule is too full.”

The waiter came over, and the thing across the table asked for a black coffee and a chicken sandwich, on wheat bread.

“I have a job and friends—”

“Bullshit. You don’t have any friends. I know because I killed them all!”

“Well I still have a job and an apartment to clean and…”

“Look, I get it, I really do. When I died, it was the worst. It was in the 1600s, I was burnt at the stake for being a heretic. Have you ever been burned alive? No? That’s what I thought. Your pain will be not even a quarter of that. I like to do things quick and easy, no mess, no fuss, just in and out and it’s done.”

“How did you come back?” I said, trying to change the subject.

His food was placed before him, and he thanked the waiter. He took a bite of his sandwich, and said: “Worshippers. Apparently I was an important person to them for God only knows. They raised my corpse out from the swamp I was tossed in afterwards. They were nice people, the worshippers. They gave me clothes, food, allowed me to feast on their newborns to regain my strength and flesh and… Wait, we’re not talking about me! We’re talking about you.

“Now, when are you available?”

“Uh… I don’t know,” I muttered, picking up my cell phone and going through the calendar. All the days were empty, but I kept scrolling. “I’m packed for weeks and weeks. Is the winter good for you?”

“No, I’ll be in Alaska then. There’s some truckers who scheduled their dates while they’re working.”

“What about spring?”

“What day?”

“April 20th.”

“No, can’t do it; way too many stoners scheduled for that day. They thought it was a joke when they agreed, but they’ll find my work isn’t a joke.”

I grumbled. This was annoying. “What about May 5th?”

He leaned back in his chair, faced the sky, and closed his eyes. “Yes, that should be fine. May 5th. Any time in particular? Are you a morning person or a night owl?”

“Might as well be night, so at least I got my whole day to myself.”

Nodding, he sat forward, opened his eyes, and finished his sandwich, then downed his coffee. “Good, good. So, then I will see you on May 5th.”

“I guess you will…”

“Goodbye,” he said, throwing a ten onto the table, and left the restaurant, disappearing in the crowd moving up the sidewalk.

“Jesus Christ,” I whispered, the reality of the situation just hitting me. “I just signed my own death warrant.”



































Writing Prompt #24 — The Demon of Wich
Prompt: You’re making a sandwich for lunch. Out of boredom, you draw a pentagram with ketchup on some bread. Consequently, you accidentally summon a bread-sized demon.

“Haha, ho ho! You summon thee, the Demon of Wich!” The nearly microscopic demon proclaimed, standing on the slice of bread. He had two horns jutting upwards, and a pronged tail slithering around his leg like a snake.

“No, nothing like that,” I said. “I was trying to make a ketchup sandwich and—”

“A sandwich of ketchup, you say?” he said, looking down at the ketchup covered bread he stood on. “This symbol here is my Gram, thus clearly you were summoning the Demon of Wich!”
“No I was not. I was making a sandwich and—”

“Summoning the mighty, the powerful, the Demon of Wich!”

“No, Jesus Christ! I was just making a damn sandwich and thought it’d be funny to draw the symbol in ketchup, then—”

“You summoned the Demon of Wich!”

“Yeah, that… Now what?”

“The Demon of Wich is powerful. So powerful in fact that he grants two choices to those who summon him. The first one is for the Demon of Wich to return to his fiery land of Wich, and the seco—”

“I choose the first option,” I said.

“But you have not heard the second option!”

“I don’t need to. I choose the first.”

“Bu—” he tried to say.

“No, first.”

Tears swelled over his oval eyes and his tiny hands balled into fists. He crouched and put his head down. Faintly, I heard sobs coming from his shaking body. “Just like all the others…” he whispered.

“Hey, look, I—uh… didn’t mean to make you cry. C’mon man, it’s okay.”

“The Demon of Wich does not… does not weep, you puny human.” He said, sniffling, wiping his eyes. “He merely got something in his devilish eye.”

“Hey, what about that second option? I bet it’s really good,” I said, smiling, patting his back with my finger.

“You are just saying that because you made me— I got something in my eye. Is that correct, human?”

“No, never. I’m actually curious to know what else the… the great and powerful Demon of Wich has to offer.”

A grin crept over his face as he straightened. He wiped his eyes again. “The second option the Demon of Wich has to offer is for the summoner of him to be always accompanied by him, to the end of days!”

“Always? Like all the time?”

“Yes, that is correct.”

“Is there a way for me to choose option two, but you only come when summoned?”

“Hm… That may be possible, human. No one has ever chosen option two before. I suppose that can be done if you—”

“I choose option two.” I quickly said.

He jumped into the air, smiling. “Wonderful! Now from this time henceforth, I, the mighty, the powerful, the great, the Demon of Wich will accompany you until the end of time!”

“Great,” I flatly said. “Now can you do me one thing?”

“Yes? What is it?”

“Can you get off the bread, so I can eat my lunch?”

He looked down at the bread, now with tiny holes where he stood, then looked back at me. “Of course, of course.” He walked to the crust, and jumped off. “Enjoy your food, my companion.”




































Writing Prompt #25 — The Haunted Toaster
Prompt: “A haunted toaster?” “I swear, it’s real. You put something, anything in there, push down the thingy and in a minute the food pops up haunted. Toasted haunted. A toast ghost. Go on and try it if you don't believe me.”

“So you’re saying if I put this bagel in, it’ll come out haunted?” Joe asked, sliding two slices of a cinnamon raisin bagel into the toaster.

“Yeah, basically.” Tom said. A pile of crumbled toast sat on the counter by him, the smell of burnt bread filling the kitchen.

Joe pressed the toaster lever down. “What happens to them? Do they come out with horns, or glowing eyes, or do they float? What makes them haunted?”

“Oh, you’ll see Joe, you’ll see.”

What could possibly happen? he thought, facing the toaster. A cold sweat formed over him. Would his bagel come out with fangs, would it want to devour him and everything that he ever loved? Or would it have sentience, glow with an eerie aura, and levitate, cause mayhem and mischief to everyone in the house for all eternity? Or would it be like the things from those stories, becoming a Great One, a thing with unimaginable shapes and colors?

The toaster dinged and the bagel popped out. Instinctively Joe grabbed them, and set them onto a paper plate. They… looked… normal? He bent and inspected them up close, finding no fangs, no ghost-like features, no tentacles, nothing but dough. He smelled them, but they smelled fine.

“Hey, uh, Tom… There’s nothing different about this bagel.”

“Bite it, just bite it.”

Joe shrugged, took a slice, and bit into it. His chewing slowed until he stopped altogether.

Tom came over to him. “Taste different, huh?”

Joe nodded.

“That’s because anything that goes into that toaster comes out as bran.”

“Jesus Christ,” Joe said, with his mouth full. “It’s awful. We gotta get rid of this thing.”

“I know buddy, I know.”






































Writing Prompt #27 — Second Chances Aren't Always the Best Option
Prompt: You made a deal with Death to never die until every human is dead. One day Earth explodes except you’re not dead.

I endlessly floated in space — days, maybe weeks, maybe years passed — I couldn’t tell and I lost count after a day or two. During that time I thought about the day Death came to me.

I sat in my living room, reading a book, when a burning pain exploded in my chest. I gripped my chest, dug nails into flesh, trying to reach into my body and pull whatever hurt out. I couldn’t catch my breath, no matter how much air I gulped.  Sweat and tears streaked my face as I toppled onto the floor. Then, he appeared, looming like a black monolith.

“I’ve come to take you,” he said with a hollow, deep voice.

“No— please,” I grunted, turning onto my back, the pain ebbing like fiery waves. “I’ll do— anything— please.”

Death glanced over my apartment, then looked down at me. “This is a small place to live in and, look, you don’t even have a view.” He glided to the French doors, overlooking the small lot in-between apartment complexes. Death slid the door open, leaned out. “And it smells, too.” He returned inside and appeared before me again.

If I wasn’t dying, I would’ve wondered why Death was so strange. “Life,” I gasped.

“What?” He bent forward. “Didn’t hear you, got to speak up.”

“Life!”

He laughed, holding his stomach. “Life! Why does everyone want more than what they have? ‘Give me more! I don’t deserve to die yet! Please, please, blah blah blah!’ Annoying species, you are. You know some animals accept and recognize when their time comes? They make the best of what they have, lie down, and let go? Why can’t you be like that? Always want more, stay a little bit longer, even if it’s for naught.

“But luckily for you, you poor soul, I will grant you never-ending life. I’ve been meaning to test this out, so why not now. I will grant you immortality, but once all human life has ended, I will come to you and take your life.” He knelt and poked my forehead. A cold, numbing sensation spread across my face, settling in the back of my head like snowdrift. “That sound good?”
I nodded, feverishly.

“Fine.” He spread his skeletal palm over my face, and a Novocain numbness flooded into me and I immediately blacked out.

But, now I’m here, floating in space. The Earth exploded and the Sun died out. Blackness gives way to more blackness.

“Looks like you’re in a pickle. Pick, pick, pickle.” He laughed from somewhere in the nothingness surrounding me. “God I loved that show. Too bad there’ll never be a reunion.”

“Just kill me already.” I said, flatly.

“Oh? Yes, I almost forgot. No, I won’t be killing you, not today at least.”

I strained my eyes to look into the darkness in front of me, finding nothing. “What— Why?”

“You’re not the only human who survived.”

“Bullshit.”

“No — you would think that — but no. There’s still a couple hundred floating elsewhere in this Oblivion; some were smart enough to build their own space shuttles before disaster struck and what-not so they could live in space. I think they’re trying to find sustainable life on other planets.”

“But, but—”

“You accepted the bargain, now you must deal with it.”

“But I’m out here! In the middle of fucking nowhere, literally nothing!”

Before his voice disappeared, he said: “Like the old saying goes, ‘Don't ask for what you can’t handle.’”







Writing Prompt #30 — The Vampiric Origins of the Black Plague
Prompt: After vampires are discovered and start explaining additional details of history, they reveal the true story of the bubonic plague.

“Sit here? Very well then,” he said, sitting on a stool by the table. The chandelier above blanketed the room in a soft, warm glow. The walls creaked under the weight of the downpour, and wind howled against the window.

“So you want me to explain how, what you humans considered, the Black Death was caused? That’s a dark period in our life, not for the obvious reasons, but because a foolish vampire caused it all. It brought shame to all Night Walkers from the shores of Ireland to the mountains of Colorado.” He sighed, tucking his silvery hair behind his ear.

“It’s not accepted to feed on sick things, especially not animals. It hasn’t yet been explained scientifically, but from hundreds of years of experience and retelling the old tale, we — vampires, Night Walkers, the Undead — accept it as truth.

“Somewhere in Europe in 1328 there was a vampire named Matthieu who stalked the streets of some town — there’s holes in the story if you couldn’t already tell. It’s been over six-hundred years, so that’s bound to happen — one night and came upon a herd of rats in an alley. Large ones with sharp teeth and grimy, grubby paws and slimy fur. The streets of this unknown town must have been empty, for he attacked these creatures, devouring one after another until he came to the last one, lying in the center of the herd. The rat was sick with something, no one knows what, but in spite of this, Matthieu bit into it like a ripe fruit.

“Instead of being torn apart like the others, this peculiar rat took to the vampiric venom — we all have this, it’s why those who’re bitten hardly fight back. It’s a numbing substance. — and started acting wildly. Matthieu backed away from the creature, watching as it came back to life. Its beady eyes became a dull garnet, its fur going gray, and its teeth into canines.

“Before he realized what he had done, the creature took off down the alley, disappearing into the fog drifting in from the sea. He was a fool for not giving chase,” he sighed, “but nonetheless, he turned away, apparently satisfied with the meal, and returned to the streets.

“Sometime later, walking the same street, creeping through the same alleys, he came upon the same rats amongst garbage. Their appearance hadn’t changed, but their demeanor had. There was intelligence in their eyes, the way they followed him as he passed, the clacking of teeth against each other. If it wasn’t for the fog, he might have noticed each one had bite marks near their necks, coagulated with blackened blood. The passing of our venom into the sick rat must have — what’s a good word? — mutated, and when it was passed into a healthy creature created the disease that you call the Black Death.

“After a while, Matthieu went from one town to another, but in each place he noticed that the rats were all the same. Soon, he realized that he must have started the strangeness that one, dreadful night. Then, in 1320, the Black Death came upon Europe like the hand of the Devil, wiping out villages, towns, even cities. No matter how high the stone walls people built, no matter how much they fortified their kingdom, it came upon them and devoured them whole.

“The stories of Matthieu are no longer told after 1321. Some say he died from the disease — though unlikely, for diseases that affect humans do not affect our kind —, and others say he was killed by a stake to the heart. I, personally, believe that one night in a dark alley the same rat he affected all those years ago appeared out of the gloom, and it fed upon him, like he did it.”



























Writing Prompt #33 — Even Demons Will Play with Dolls
Prompt: The demon looked confused as he found himself summoned into a pink room, covered in princess posters and unicorn stickers. In front of him was a girl that looked about 5 years old, hugging a teddy bear and jumping up and down excitedly saying “yay yay yay, it worked!”

The incantation was read. The underworld shook. Through fire and brimstone, he rose and tore across the abyss. A vortex of fleshy colors swirled around him, formed, took shape, and entered him. He closed his eyes, and when he opened them he stood in a room far pinker than anything he had ever seen. Posters with various female humans in different poses were plastered to the walls, and sprinkled around them were colorful, shiny stickers of horses with horns, and tiny cherubs with glittery wings.

His sigil was drawn on the table he stood upon. A tiny, plastic knife blanched red and a paint set lay by it; a wrinkled sheet of paper was on the floor, the incantation scribbled in orange crayon.

“Yay! Yay, yay, yay! It worked! It worked!” A little female human cheered across the room, sitting on a plastic chair ringed by stuffed animals. A small doll house stood in the center of them, partially open.

“You summoned me?” he asked, his voice grating, as if his throat ground gravel to a fine dust.

She jumped up, throwing her hand in the air, which had a small mark across the palm, and pointed towards Him. “I did! I did!”

“For what purpose? Only those who require removal of a human life summons me.”

“To play! Daddy’s not home, and mommy’s sleeping!”

“You summon me… to play?” A fine scarlet mist escaped his lipless mouth, rising and settling against the ceiling. The plaster began to melt, drips of white falling on his horned shoulders, the table.

“Yes! I need someone to be Ken! Girls can’t play as boys—”

His amber eyes glowed, and as if a storm cloud passed, the room darkened. The snaking lines etched up his body ebbed with fiery light, illuminating the room. The child sat back down. More mist seeped from him, from his pores, his eyes, became a suffocating smog. The paint, walls, the table beneath him, began to melt, burn, blacken.

“You summoned me!”  he roared, stepping off the table, collapsing behind him. “To play? Do you know who I am, child?” The carpet singed around his hoofed feet, the reek of burnt plastic filling the room.

A veil of tears covered her eyes, streamed down her chubby cheeks. She balled her shirt collar in her hand, and gnawed on her lower lip. The girl spoke in between sobs. “Yes… I wanted someone to play with… Daddy’s— daddy’s always gone, and— and mommy’s always sleeping… She takes pills… We— we— we moved here for daddy’s work. I have… I have no one to play with.”

He loomed over the girl, peering down through the red mist. The demon glanced back to the table, seeing the paper with his incantation, the plastic knife, and his symbol, now destroyed.

“You summoned me little human,” he said, the glow of his eyes and body waned, and disappeared. “Thus, I will do your bidding this once.” Light fell into the room through the window once more, reflecting off the pink walls, vibrance swelling in the room. The mist quickly dissipated.

The demon crouched, took the doll that must have been Ken into his claws, and asked: “How do we begin, then?”




















Writing Prompt #37 — The Devil Took It
Prompt: You had always heard the phrase, “Beat the Devil out of it” but never thought too much about it. One day you’re beating a rug out, and the Devil actually comes out of it. 

He— it— something with horns and a tail toppled out from the rug my mother had given me when I moved out. The thing hit the concrete walkway, rolled, and petered out in the grass.

What the hell is that?

I didn’t know what to do. I dropped the rug, and slowly walked over to the dark red thing.

“Uh—”

“What the hell was that for?” it moaned in English.

It rolled over onto what I believed to be its stomach, and pushed itself up with two tiny arms into a sitting position. Its thin, snake-like tail coiled around its waist as it cracked its back.

It looked up at me with deep, amber eyes. “Why the hell did you do that? That really hurt.”

“I, uh… was…” I backed towards the walkway.

“I, uh— was, uh,” it said, mockingly, “just spit it out already!”

I pointed to the rug. “I was cleaning and…”

“Weren’t you told that devils live inside those things?”

My mouth hung open as I nodded.

“I guess you never listened to your creators, huh?”

I didn’t reply, but it continued on.

“Humans, Jesus…” it removed a case from somewhere behind its body, flipped it open, took a black strip from it, and plucked it into its mouth. It flicked its claws, and the end of the black strip ignited. It took a drag. “Never listen, do they? Don’t care about what or who lives in what, only that their things are tidy and clean.”

“Are you saying,” I said, “you lived in there?”

“Of course I did! Didn’t you see me come tumbling out like some idiot? Or are you one of those blind ones?”

I shook my head. “I’m not blind.”

“It was rhetorical,” it said flatly. “Anyway, it doesn’t matter, really it doesn’t. Just put me back and we’ll call it a day. No harm, no foul.”

“Put you back?”

He exhaled sickly green smoke. “Yes, put me back. Didn’t your creators explain this to you?”

I shook my head, again.

It palmed its face, shaking its head. “Jesus,” it muttered, “this species…” It sighed. “Okay, all you have to do is lay it out flat, and place me in its center. I’ll do the rest.”

“Okay.” I dumbly nodded.

I rolled out the rug on the walkway, and gently scooped the demon up.

“Watch where you’re putting your hands!”

It was warm, like carrying a ball of laundry fresh out of the dryer. I placed it in the rug’s center.

“Good job, good job. Surprised you could manage to do that.” It rolled its eyes. “Well, nice talking to you. Next time, ask before cleaning another’s possessions.”

It snapped its claws, then it was gone, leaving behind a puff of red-orange smoke. I watched it drift away with the breeze, then gently, cautiously, rolled the rug up and brought it inside. I put it in the hallway closet, never touching it since.

When my mother came over the next day, asking where her rug was, I told her: “The devil took it.”




Writing Prompt #39 — Satin, Ruler of Heck
Prompt: You are Satan’s younger brother, the ruler of Heck.

They always loved him more, I thought as I moved down the marshmallow and gingerbread walkway, always believed that he would be the only ruler in our family; thought that I would do nothing in comparison, but here I am creators, here is Satin, Lord of Heck.

A smiling, soft blue serpent spun out from a honey pond.

“How are you this day, Satin?”

I nodded. “Well, doing well — and yourself?”

“Every day I remain here, is every day that I am splendid.” The serpent spun once more, then dived into the honey.

Ruler! Overlord! Top dog! No one can disagree, no can argue; no one dares to.

The gingerbread path rose up the sprinkled chocolate hill, and weaved down into the black licorice and dark chocolate forest. A billowy peppermint striped squirrel crawled from one of the trees, peering at me with twinkling, orange eyes.

“Greeting Satin! What are your plans for this day?”

Slave, peasant— I own him, own all of this forest.

“Oh, not much this day, little one. Perhaps just a stroll through the land, making sure everything is in order.”

“Do not tire yourself out, Lord — wouldn’t want you to be too exhausted for the gathering.”
Ah, the gathering; where they come as one and grovel, beg at my feet. If only the creators could see me then...

“I ensure I will not. Good day, little one.”

“And to you, too!”

I left the forest and continued along the path to a clearing cut from the cinnamon grass. Multi-colored gumdrops rimmed the clearing. In the center stood my throne, crafted from hard candy and spearmint sticks. I sat upon it, waiting.

Droves came, laughing, dancing, smiling into the clearing: squirrels, deer, rabbits, chinchillas; serpents; large, grinning behemoths with butterscotch swirling up their horns and nutmeg on their breath; tiptoeing titans standing fifty feet tall, carrying cauldrons upon their shoulders, brimming with warm apple cider; long, sinewy things with shimmering, rainbow wings and mouths issuing hot cocoa for all to enjoy.

They gathered around me.

Ah, my people, prisoners of Heck...

“What is on the agenda today, Lord?” a titan asked.

“There is only one thing, and that is to prepare for a newcomer to Heck.”

They clapped, cheered, jumped up and down.

“Who?” a rabbit asked.

“He goes by the name Chris Cringle.”

If only my creators could be here now, I thought, grinning.















Writing Prompt #40 — In His House at R’lyeh, Dead Cthulhu Annoys Kayakers
Prompt: Cthulhu arrives, he’s 14 feet long and likes to flip over kayaks and canoes. It’s all a bit underwhelming compared to what we expected. 

“C’mon!” Jake shouted as his canoe flipped, sending him crashing into the cold, murky lake. “Damnit!”

Susan rowed over in her canoe, and helped him flip his over and get him back inside. “What happened?”

“It’s that asshole,” he spat.
“Who?”

“You know the one,” he said, nodding towards the water. It bubbled. “Look, see, he’s even laughing about it.”

“Are you sure it’s him?” she asked, as they began to row towards the shore.

“Yeah, I’m sure.”

“How?”

“Just look,” he set his paddle across his lap, and pointed towards a family in kayaks. One by one, a small, thin tentacle rose from the water, gently wrapped around each kayak, and yanked it towards the water. Their kayaks flipped, some even picked up once the people were poured out and skipped across the lake as if they were stones.

“See!” Jake said.

“Oh, that is annoying,” she said.

“Absolutely.”

“Why do you think he does it?”

“No one will ever know.” He began rowing again, maneuvering around her. He looked forward to being on land again, at least he wouldn’t have to deal with him there.

“Why not?” She followed him, rowing faster to keep up with him.

“That’s the thing about Elder Gods,” he said, “we can’t comprehend their reasoning.”






































Writing Prompt #42 — Father Puts a Stop to His Overreacting Children
Prompt: The world is in chaos. People are rioting in the streets, claiming that God is bringing about the end of times. Thing is, you don’t remember saying that. It’s about time you head down to Earth to set these humans straight.

“Okay, look here,” I said, standing before the crowd. “I never said it was the end of times.”

The crowd was slack-jawed with wide eyes, after they finished gasping, screaming, and fainting. 

“I still don’t know how you got—”

A building behind me collapsing, crashing into a burning, brick heap. I sighed.

“Anyway, I don’t know how you came to that conclusion.”

“The bible—” someone said.

“What?”

A skeletal man pushed through the crowd, coming to the front. “The bible says judgment day was coming, and by the way this country’s going, we believed that it was upon us.”

I rubbed my eyes with my fingers as I shook my head. Jesus Christ… 

I pointed at them and they jumped. If it was any other situation, I would’ve laughed. “Look, it’s not judgement day, nor will it be anytime soon. The sky would be on fire, it would rain ash and brimstone, there would lava bubbling up from fissures in the Earth. When judgment day is here, you’ll know it.”

“But—” the man started to say.

“But nothing, my son. Now return,” I shouted, my voice booming from the clouds, “to your home, to your families, treat each other as equals! Repair the damage you have done! If you choose to run rampant through the place that I have created, judgment day will be upon you, but not by the ending of the world but by my hands alone.”

Most stood dumbly while others put down their weapons and torches, turned, and walked away, back to their homes, to their loved ones. The ones that remained didn’t move, as if they were now statues. One by one, I walked to them, touched their forehead and they fell unconscious.
Someone will deal with them later.

Once the crowd dispersed and those who remained were fast asleep, I vanished from my creation.

Oftentimes, I regret making that place.


































Writing Prompt #47 — The Family and the Disease
Prompt: We lock our doors at night, not to keep people out, but to keep what we become in. 

We stay in to protect those outside, at least that’s what my grandmother said before she passed. Back in the day the Family — our Family — had a larger problem with their, what I like to call, disease. Now some may believe it’s not a disease but a gift, a gift from someone from somewhere up above or down below, depending on who you ask. Either way, for as long as I can remember — for as long as anyone in my Family can remember, that is — we’ve always had this disease. No one knows how it came to be, how to cure it, or even how to manage its symptoms.

But what we do know is that it only takes effect after nightfall. We thought maybe it was the UV ray, but after testing with a UV light device we found that we were wrong. Then we thought it was infrared light, which as with the UV light, found that wasn’t the case either. Then, there were other strange and, oftentimes, stupid tests, like the temperature  change from day to night, or the color of the sky or the way grass is cut and it was all just some kind of allergy.

No, no, and… no.

Either way, doesn’t matter now; honestly, it doesn’t. It’s here and it’s staying — no changing that. Our Family lives in a cabin off in the woods — for the populace’s protection, not ours. It has six bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a few dozen acres filled with trees, bushes, some creeks, and what seems like thousands of critters and animals. Our ancestors purchased the land for a dime, and their offspring built on it. Older folks live on the first floor, younger ones on the second, the youngest up in the two-bedroom attic. To give an idea, I am only fifty-years-old in human years, though I feel, think, and look about twenty. The others in the house… Well, I can’t say the same. Some look fifty but are actually eighty, while the oldest look a hundred but in reality are two-hundred. Age is a finicky thing with the disease. Anyway, back to the attic, that’s where I live. I only leave to use the facilities and grab something to eat.

It’s night now. Every door is locked, even the bathrooms and the trapdoor to the basement. It’s cloudy, but according to the radio, that’ll pass and it will be an open, black sky. The weatherman also said the moon will be out and full — which always makes the disease much, much worse.

First my skin will stretch like bubblegum, then, my oiled back hair will sprout in tufts, billowing over my shoulders. Then comes the cracking, the endless sharp pains of my bones breaking, mending, breaking, mending, until they are in a form more canine than human. At first it’s a horrible pain, but like all horrible things in life, you get to use it after a while. And, following the snapping and rearranging on my insides, the muscles will tighten, becoming sinewy and stronger; my teeth cut into jagged points that tear flesh effortlessly; and my fingernails will elongate, sharpen to even finer points.

Then, lastly, the coup de grace, is my mind slips into a bestial, primordial whirlpool of nothingness. I no longer think, but act; no longer ponder, but pounce; no longer hunger, but starve. The basic instincts consuming my consciousness scream, reverberating through my long, muscular limbs and malformed bones to eat, to devour, to piss and shit and fuck without shame, without exhaustion, an endless source of lycanthrope power.

Ah, the clouds have cleared.

The moon’s full.

Sorry, but the disease calls.


























Writing Prompt #52 — I Saw Mommy Underneath the Mistletoe
Prompt: I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus, underneath the mistletoe last night. Nine months later mommy gave birth to a suspiciously rosy cheeked baby.

It had been nine months since I saw my mother kissing a large man, who wasn’t my father, wearing a red suit lined with white fur. It was as though time skipped ahead; one moment she announced she was pregnant — by whom? I asked, to only be told I was being silly, it was my father, of course — and the next she was in the hospital, feverishly pushing and screaming obscenities at my father who held her hand so tightly I believed I heard from the waiting room his bones grinding together.

In a rush of days, of family coming and going from the hospital room, of piss-poor coffee and stale food from the kitchen, from work to the hospital, then back again, eventually it came to the day we could take the child home. My father had difficulties with the baby seat until he tossed it across the backseat and told my mother to hold the child as he drove. I sat next to the upturned seat, holding it so the hard plastic couldn’t dig into my side.

Home was another whirlwind of annoyance and learning. It had been so long since they had a baby in the house, twenty years or so. My father took it in stride and my mother, save for over-worrying, did as well throughout the summer and fall, but once December rolled around, something changed. Not with my parents, no, but with the baby.

His cheeks plumped and rosy. His tiny fingers became doughy. My mother said he hadn’t gained weight, but anyone holding the child knew that wasn’t true. His eyes became a crystal-clear blue and glistened under the fire’s glow coming from the hearth. His soft brown hair lightened to the point it looked almost silver. Day after day more changes came, more and more things that I, and my father, noticed. The weight gain, the reddening of his now bulging nose, the way it was drawn to the tall evergreen sprinkled with lights and bulbs in the study, the giggling when bells rang or the fire crackled, and its extreme cravings for cookies and cold milk.

My father took to the drink. Although he hadn’t questioned my mother, he knew deep down that the child he had welcomed into his home, into his arms, was not his. I discovered this one night after he had gone asleep. He left his notepad out next to the decanter, scribbled with dates and mathematical equations. If the baby was born on August 25, that meant… More notes, scribbled text: We didn’t make love on the 25th that night, hardly the entire month — busy with presents and work and family… Jesus, my wife… No, but… Must be!

But, it was all doubt and suspect, heresy without evidence, until Christmas morning. I went into the baby’s room, who was already awake, his fat fingers wrapped around the brim of the crib, his blue eyes wide and wondrous, his silver hair wafted over his forehead. His small mouth formed an O and it seemed he was trying to speak. Which at the time I thought was odd, babies couldn’t speak that early, or so I believed… I crouched and turned an ear to his moving lips.

“What are you trying to say?” I whispered.

After a few still moments… 

“Ho… ho… ho.”































Writing Prompt #62 — Demon’s Caffeinated
Prompt: You’ve just opened your first cafe, but unfortunately the exact building you opened your cafe in happens to be the exact “landing” zone for the upcoming demonic invasion. However, after the portal opened, the army was stopped on their tracks to enjoy your products. 

“...And it used to be called Cafe Carl, but when the portal opened, I switched it to Demon’s Caffeinated. Oh, wait, Fred just came in, hold on,” I said to the gorgon hunched over the counter, and shouted over the din of demons sitting around the dark stone tables, holding goblets brimming with their favorite drinks, “Hey, Fred! How’s it going?”

Fred stopped mid-stride near the back, raised one of his thirteen, skeletal hands, and came to the counter. “Living, and you?”

I patted the gorgon on his rocky shoulder, and he shuffled off with his drink. Before Fred arrived, I made his favorite, a chocolate mocha with brimstone shavings, and set it on the counter. “Same, same. How’s the kids?”

Fred picked up the drink, inhaled the volcanic scent, and his lipless, craggy mouth formed a smile. “I—uh—what? Oh, the kids? All little spitfires, but what can you expect, they did come out of the demigoddess’s blood spitting, gaping hole after all.”

“Okay, okay,” I nudged his gray, stone arm, laughing, “you don’t have to brag about it.”
He chuckled, the sound of gravel crunching. “Can’t help myself.”

“Hey, buddy!” a squat demon with gnarled horns spat behind Fred. “If you’re done chit-chatting, can I order my drink now? I have shit to do today.”

Fred glanced behind him. “Oh sorry, I gotta go see those guys over there anyway. How much do I owe you, Carl?”

I shook my head and waved him off. “On the house.”

He nodded, raised his cup, and disappeared into the crowd.

The squat demon came to the counter, placing his three-fingered paws flat onto it. He looked up at the menu behind me. “Can I get… Uh… A peppermint volcano latte with soy, and pure whipped souls on top, please?”

“Yeah, sure, that’ll be fifty democoins.”

“What!” he shouted, his hands forming fists. “It used to be twenty!”

“Use to be, yeah, but pure whipped souls are hard to come by nowadays. Prices go up — inflation and all that. If you want, you can get the same drink without the whipped souls for thirty-five.”

He scratched his reptilian skinned neck, scanning the menu once more. “Okay, instead of the latte — can I get a chocolate strawberry cappuccino with a twist of sins of the damned? How much would that run you?”

“About twenty democoins… Sins of the damned are easier to come by.”

He nodded. “You’re telling me. I'll take it.”

“Great,” I said, as he dropped two hexagonal, crimson stones onto the counter. I pushed them into a box beneath, and turned around to set his drink.

After I handed him the goblet, he groaned and walked off.

Not even a thanks, asshole, I thought before a tall, blackened creature came to the counter.
“Can I get, uh… What’s a hellfire latte?”

I rolled my eyes, but smiled. The demons were a lot like those they tortured, even if they didn’t know it.















Writing Prompt #63 — Paperwork of the Afterlife
Prompt: When you die, you're asked to fill out a feedback form: “Which design did you purchase? How did you find the human form? Rate from one to five stars. Did you find opposable thumbs useful? Any comments, suggestions, other feedback?”

When I opened my eyes, I was no longer looking at the ceiling as blood seeped from my forehead, but sitting in a crooked chair in an empty room. The linoleum floor had an ugly pattern, oily water dripped in the corners from the yellowed ceiling, and the green walls appeared moldy. A clipboard was on my lap, the metal clamp pinching a pen and a single sheet of paper. It read: Feedback & Suggestions of Life, below in tinier lettering: To Potentially Improve or Enhance Those Still Existent or Those Who Will Become Existent.

I glanced around again, to reaffirm I was the only person there. I took a deep breath as I looked to the form again, and smelled onions. Five questions were below the title. I removed the pen, uncapped it, and considered the first question.

Which design did you purchase?

“Design?” I muttered. “Purchased?”

After a moment, I put: I don’t know… Boy design?

The second question: How did you find the human form?

“Uh…” I wrote, Okay, I guess?

The third: From one to five stars, how would you rate your experience?

Two and a half, sometimes three.

Fourth: Did you find the opposable thumbs useful?

Absolutely.

And the last question: Any comments, suggestions, or other feedback?

I tapped the pen against the tablet, scratched my nose, then rubbed the bullet hole in my forehead. I hummed as I wrote down: Maybe make it a bit easier? Like, make money not as important or make enough of it for everyone? And religion, I don’t know, make it not such a big deal — don’t remove it — just… make it less important. Oh, and can people calm down about everything? Someone saying something doesn’t mean they should shoot that person in the head, really.

At the bottom was a line for Date of Passing, Date of Signature, and Signature. I filled those out, capped the pen, and slid it back under the metal clamp.

A bell chimed from somewhere, and a seam ran down the far wall. The two sections parted like sliding doors and a tall woman wearing a black suit with crimson trim strode over to me. Her silver hair was tied back and her eyes glowed amber. “All done?” she asked.

“I—uh—ah, yeah,” I handed her the tablet.

She skimmed it over, and tucked it under her arm. “Wonderful. Now,” she turned aside, pointed with a jagged finger, and spoke quickly, almost too quickly for me to understand, “go through that doorway, take a left, then a right, and another left and you’ll be at the Office of Transference. There they’ll have you fill out some other forms, and after that you’ll be directed to the Office of Acceptance and Positioning. There they’ll have you fill out more forms, then have you choose where’d you like to go and come to terms with that — if you need it, of course. Then, after, you’ll be transferred to the Office of Transportation, where, as the name states, you’ll be transported to the place you chose previously. Got it?”

I dumbly nodded.

“Wonderful. Well, have a good rest of your afterlife,” she said, then vanished, leaving behind a cloud of red mist.

I sat for a while in silence, staring at the doorway that would lead to a never-ending cycle of forms and offices, wondering if I should bother going or just stay there. A bit later, I prodded the hole in my head again, looking around once more, and sighed, standing. I walked to the carpeted hallway with its floral wallpaper, inhaled deeply, and crossed the threshold, following the lady’s directions.








Writing Prompt #65 — A Party Ruined by an Undead
Prompt: “I promise I’ll always come and see you on your birthday” It was sweet when he first said it. But dad’s been dead for 5 years and you wish he’d stop. 

“Happy birthday to you,” my family sang around the table, “happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear Michelle, happy birthday to yo—” The sound of snapping, like breaking twigs, and something thudding against the floor silenced everyone. We turned to my father, standing off to the side. His decayed tongue loosely hung from his gaping mouth as he knelt to pick up his jaw from the floor.

“God,” my mom sighed, “c’mon Frank…”

“Imsawry,” he moaned, snapping his jaw back into place with a loud pop. He rotated it, licked his gray lips, and said again, “I'm sorry. Let’s not worry about it, okay? It’s Michelle’s birthday.” He faced me. “C’mon sweetie, blow out your candles.”

So annoying, I thought, rolling my eyes, as I blew the lit thirteen candles sticking out from the white frosting. I wished for my friends to be here instead of my dad, as the flames disappeared.
Everyone began to clap—

Snapping and thudding, again. We turned to see dad’s two-fingered hand had broken off at the wrist and hit the wall, then fell to the floor.

“Jesus Christ, Frank,” Richard, my step-dad, said, “can’t you keep yourself together?”

“Well, Dick,” my dad said, walking to his hand, “it’s kinda hard after being gone for so long. We all don’t have the benefit of all being like you, Dick.” He shoved his hand back into the wrist, rotated it, and returned to the table. “So, my baby, what you wish for? A new TV? An iPod?”

I shook my head, rolling my eyes again. God, why is he so annoying?

My mom must’ve seen my face because she quickly turned on the lights. “Let’s cut the cake!”

After everyone was given a piece of cake on paper plates, I sat on the couch. MTV was on, but muted. Richard and my mom sat on the end of the couch, while the rest of my family sat or stood, talking around the house. Dad was on the floor in front of me. I couldn’t help but his attempts to eat his cake. Every time he would lift it on the plastic fork, his hand would shake and the piece would fall back onto the plate. He tried again, and again, until he was successful once, but the chewed cake oozed out from the holes in his cheeks. It ran down his face, dropping into his lap and rolling onto the floor. He turned to ask me a question, and his leg smeared it into the carpet.

“Frank!” My mom shouted, setting her plate down. “You got cake on the carpet!”

“Oh?” He moved over, looking. “What? Oh, I did. I’m sorry. I’ll clean that up.” He stood, and his arm holding his plate snapped off, and fell to the floor.

My mom’s mouth opened, and Richard’s temple bulged.

“Shit— I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’ll clean that up, too.” He picked up his arm, shoved it back into the socket, and moved towards the hallway leading to the kitchen. “The cleaning supplies still under the sink?”

My mom rose, clenching her hands. “You know Frank, why don’t you just leave?”

The air in the room became palpable. I looked from mom to dad, then mom again. Dad stood in silence for a moment, ran his hand through his patchy, clumpy hair, and said: “You know what, Marsha, I come out of the grave for one day a year, for her,” he pointed at me, “and all you and Dick have done is treat me terribly. For what? What have I done that's so bad?”

“Uh… I don’t know, Frank, how about decomposing in front of the whole family, or stinking up the whole house for weeks, or, I don’t know, dying in the first place!”

He jabbed a finger at my mom. “How dare you blame me for dying! It wasn’t my fault!”

“You were found with a needle in your arm, Frank,” Richard said, standing. “You had a fucking needle in your arm! Your skin was white and you pissed all over yourself! How is that not your fault!”

“You know what Dick, stay out this — this a family matter!” He pointed at the ground. “And this is my family, not yours!”

Richard shook his head. “Oh you know what Frank— I’m more a part of this family than you ever will be. You’re dead! You’re gone! Hell, even your own daughter doesn’t want you showing up to her birthdays anymore!”

It looked like he had been slapped. My dad looked at me, his eyes wide, mouth closed. I’m sure if he could still cry, he would have. “Is that true, sweetie? That you don’t want me around anymore.”

Tears formed over my eyes, falling down my cheeks. I bit my lower lip, nodded. “You’re—,” I whispered, “you’re embarrassing.”

He stared without speaking, then turned to mom. “Fine, I’ll go. Even if my own daughter doesn’t want me here, who I promised to see every year, I’ll leave. I’ll see you both,” he pointed to Richard and mom, “in Hell.” As he strode to the front door, his knee collapsed and he crashed to the floor. When he tried to catch himself on the wall, his fingers snapped back and tumbled onto the carpet.

“Oh my God, Frank,” my mom hissed, shaking her head.

He crawled over and picked up his fingers, muttering, “Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know,” then set his legs and got up, and left.

It was the last time I saw him.
























Writing Prompt #66 — Adam’s Amorphous Alehouse
Prompt: You’ve recently started college and have found an extremely well-paying job ad for a bartender working the graveyard shift. You arrive for your interview to learn that the bar is strictly for supernatural creatures and monsters. They hire you.

It was a month into the new job at Adam’s Amorphous Alehouse. I wiped down the counter, glancing around the empty bar. We opened in ten minutes. There were wooden and stone tables of varying sizes strewn about, some had regular chairs, others had mounds of stone, and others were just hunks of rock. Doorways of all different colors lined all three walls, while one circular one jutted from the ceiling. They were crafted differently with different materials — some worldly, some not — while others possessed illogical contours or entirely new, incomprehensible shapes.

A chime sounded in the distance, signaling it was time to start. I dropped the rag into the wash bucket beneath the counter, reached down and gripped the lever protruding from the floor. I inhaled, exhaled, pushing it forward. All the doorways pulled open, some whining as metal scrapped against metal, others grinding with stone against stone, and a few let out guttural moans.

A fury of noise, of bodies, of shapes pouring from the doorways, from the ceiling, seeping, and oozing from the floorboards. A blur of colors and designs and patterns that an amateur to the bartending world or the world beyond would lose their mind to. Before I registered what was happening, I was taking orders, filling drinks with cheap beer and souls of the innocent, handing kegs brimming with golden elixirs, and goblets and basins etched with archaic runes, spilling with kaleidoscopic colors, to floating creatures, to monsters hanging from the ceiling by sinewy arms, to shadowy beings looming in four-dimensional space over me as if I stood in an empty plane of existence.

I kept my brain from reeling, kept my lungs from locking up, kept from crying or laughing or pissing myself. The rush was always the worst. After a while, maybe an hour, maybe days, maybe weeks — time didn’t work the same in the triple A as it did outside — everyone was settled, sitting at the tables, or floating above them, or existing in a place in-between their world and the bar. They would be gone soon, they always were.

I wiped the sweat from my forehead, sat back and poured myself a beer. The cold drink cooled my churning my stomach. My mind calmed and my hands gradually stopped shaking. It wouldn’t last long, it never did. The opening rush would start again soon. Five minutes here is fifteen years elsewhere.

The bar emptied and the doorways automatically sealed themselves.

Another chime in the distance. I set my empty glass down, sighed, and leaned forward, gripping the lever. I inhaled, exhaled, shoving it forward.

The doorways opened. They were upon me again.


































Writing Prompt #71 — The Golden Cup of Coffee
Prompt: There is a legend about a man who lives high on a treacherous mountain who will brew the most delightful, delicious, invigorating cup of coffee for anyone brave and strong enough to climb the mountain. You’re a rich, adventurous youth, and you want to know the secret of this legendary brew.

The stout, old man sits on a small plush stool in the center of his home on the mountain. Dozens of bags, full and spilling, of coffee lean against the walls, except for a door in the back, behind a counter where a coffeepot and three porcelain cups are. The beans’ aroma is almost overwhelming, a wave of dozens of different roasts and flavors. I’m tempted to cover my nose, but I don’t want to appear weak.

“So, you’ve come for the Golden Cup of Coffee, too? Like the ones before you?”

I nod. “But not just that — I’ve come to purchase the recipe as well.” My grip on the suitcase handle tightens.

He shakes his liver-spotted head. “Not for sale. You have traveled great heights to reach here, so you will be rewarded with a cup — nothing more, nothing less.”

I shake my head. “That’s not how this’ll work. I’m a wealthy man. I could buy this mountain, this home, and everything inside it, but I don’t want to do that. The rumor is that the Golden Cup of Coffee possesses unworldly powers, and I just want to know how it’s made, that’s all.”

The man stands slowly from his stool, his knees popping. He raises a gnarled cane from the ground and props himself against him. “You’re not the first person to offer me money. Nothing here is for sale.”

My temples begin to throb, and I grind my teeth. Just take the money, old man.

“Money has no value here,” he says, smiling, “but since you have traveled such a long way, I will show you how the secret ingredient. Does this suit you?”

I crack my jaw, nod. “Yes, fine — if that’s all you can do.”

I follow the old man past the counter to the door in the back. He places his palm beneath the copper doorknob and a click issues from it, then he pushes it open. With a wave of his hand, he says, “Come.”

I step into a dark room, unable to see anything but the floor under me, lit only by the light spilling from the main room. I turn back to the man, who I think is still by the door, but the door slams shut and clicks, and a golden light blare. I wince and cover my eyes with my arm, facing the room again. The light dims, and I see the man standing near a large vat of swirling, sparkling golden liquid. Up close, I smell honey, coffee, milk, a tinge of citrus.

“This is what gives my coffee what you call unworldly powers,” he says.

I lean over the rim, peering deeply into the cosmic looking substance. “What’s it made from?” I ask. If I could figure out that, then maybe I could have it created. I wouldn’t have to buy it from him.

“Greed,” I hear him say before my feet are off the ground, and everything becomes gold.



























Writing Prompt #74 — An Unexpected Hand
Prompt: It’s three in the morning. You’re on your usual browse through the internet before you go to sleep. You sit up to plug your phone to charge and try to put the charger into the outlet. Like every night, you miss every time. Suddenly, a hand grabs yours from under the bed. “I’ll help,” a voice says.

“Shit!” I pulled my arm back, my heart racing. “Why do you have to do that?”

The wrinkled hand plugged the charger into the wall. My phone dinged, notifying me it was now charging.

“It’s fun,” the familiar, wispy voice said, giggling, from under the bed, “why else?”

“Well stop doing it.” I lay back, my head sinking into the pillow.

“And if I don’t?”

“Then back to the cellar, with the rest of the Dark Ones.” I said with my eyes closed, grinning.

“You wouldn’t do that again, would you?”

“I would.”

“Oh, you,” the voice spat, “just you wait. One day we’ll figure out how you escaped the Abyss, then we’ll get you and you’ll be sorry.”

“Uh huh,” I nodded, “all right. Well when that happens, let me know.”

After a few silent minutes, the voice said: “Love you, dear.”

“Love you too, grandma.”








Writing Prompt #75 — A Kind Possession
Prompt: You are a demon. After too many good deeds, you become “possessed” by the spirit of a nice person, who forces you to do good things in Hell.

Someone had gotten inside me, possessed me. It was like having a child in my head with controls to each of my dozen limbs. I tried tearing the spirit from my mind by pouring lava into my head; had other demons scrape my skull’s insides clean with their tendrils and claws; even let the spirits of the damned try to remove the possession, but nothing worked.

It was awful.

I revolted when I knelt and helped a man from a pike-ridden hole in the brimstone; I screamed when I pulled a group of women down from the barbed nooses dangling from stalactites; I nearly wept scooping the bloated husks out from the blood sea. They smiled, thanked me, even going so far as to say they loved me for helping them.

It was never-ending altruistic chores. People in Hell were meant to be suffering, meant to be tortured, yet I was helping them, easing their pain. I was thankful when it happened so much that the higher ranked demons took notice. I wanted to explain the possession, but they didn’t bother to listen.

They finally ended my suffering by strapping my limbs to the walls, piercing them with spikes, and tethering my neck, submerging my head in lava. Although I still live, tormented by my imprisonment, it’s all the better, for being generous and kind was truly hell.















Writing Prompt #77 — The House Before the World Tree
Prompt: The world tree is in your backyard. And you are getting pretty tired of how the gods are knocking at your door to see it.

Originally, it was amazing to have gods knocking on my front door, though they were only doing so to pass through my house to get to the World Tree in the backyard. Odin, Loki, Thor, Freya, Frigg, and so on. But soon it became less amazing and more annoying. At any time during the day — while I was sleeping, watching TV, taking a shower, or going to the bathroom — there would be knock at the door and I would have to let them in. Of course, I tried not doing it, ignoring their pounding, but I quickly learned that wouldn’t work, for the gods wouldn’t be held back by a slab of wood. At least they paid for a new door.

It wasn’t even just the knocking, but the way they would lumber through the house as though it was a barn. Their boots or feet thick with mud, leaving streaks across the hardwood. Gods who had massive weapons would aimlessly carry them, tearing holes in the ceiling, knocking over potted plants, hanging pictures, knick-knacks, and books. And, they weren’t average height, they were giants, at least ten feet tall or more. Enormous shoulders and backs and chests, huge muscular arms, and legs, all covered by steel or gold plating. They reeked, too. I don’t think there was a shower or bath where they came from, or on top of the World Tree.

Eventually I sold the house to them and moved a town over, living off the exuberant amount they paid for the two-story condo. And, when I’m alone, sitting in silence in my new house, I wonder if they think of me, wonder if I played as much a role in their lives as they did mine… I hope if so, that I was as annoying to them as they were to me.















Writing Prompt #82 — Too Much of a Good Thing
Prompt: When a vampire feeds on you they rapidly wither and die, while your own youth and vitality is restored. For centuries you have sought out and allowed these vile creatures to seduce you in order to sustain your own existence and end their reigns of terror in a single night.

June 13, 1902

Oh, what an evening it was. Exciting! Thrilling! I have not had a night quite as this since the Blood Moon of seventy-six. There must have been ten, twenty of those vile, blood-sucking bastards out tonight. All of them, every last one, gone; withered. Presently they’re a pile of ash and soot that the wind will blow to the river by the afternoon. Where they belong, where they have always belonged. Filthy, hideous creatures. No wonder they must only travel by night, no surprise they stay hidden in the shadows and feast on the weak-willed women of the city.

It makes me nearly ill feeling them within me — coursing in my veins, my lively flesh. However, it's a small price to pay to live forever.

God! My eyes are wide and my lungs are open and my heart beats against my chest just like when I was a boy. The air is crisp and smells delightful.

Dawn is upon me and I must meet Gregory soon. Adieu.

June 20, 1902

This night and the last has been splendid. Beyond splendid. Magnificent. Nearly fifteen tonight! Fifteen! How many of these vile monsters exist in the city? How many more beyond its boundaries? Do they come on the ships? Do they hide in the docks or in the cellars of the abandoned foundries? If only I knew. If I did, I would venture to these places and allow them to drink until they could no longer. I would laugh and smile and watch as they crumble to dust before my feet.

Gregory had the audacity to suggest that I am becoming too engrossed in this endeavor. That I was, “stepping too far into the darkness,” he said. What does he know, truly? He’s not an immortal, like me. He’s as mortal as any other person you see gallivanting around the city. I have removed dozens of these abominations and I will not cease until every last one of them are gone. Not only for my deceased family, but for the world.

Just giving it thought makes my blood run hot. I must go for a walk. Allow the sun and wind to wash away this frustration.

June 23, 1902

I have discovered where at least a hundred dwell. In a dilapidated bread factory near the docks. An enormous place with shattered and boarded windows. Even though it has not been in use for what seems eons, it’s insides still smell of yeast. Likely the tainted water. However, beneath the smell, there's the stench of the undead, of blood, of decay. This evening I will walk into their domain and allow them to feast. I will even ask Gregory to join me. For him to see first-hand what I do. For him to understand that these creatures are nothing more but dust devils, and I am doing the work of man, of God. I will give them what they want. And I, most importantly, will get what I want.

June 30, 1902

Seems only fitting the last entry in this diary will be my own. Laurence, that terrible night, took me to an abandoned factory. He was thrilled. He was like a boy in a sweets shop. He was like a youth undoing a woman’s dress for the first time. What a fool he was. What a fool I was — though I was the luckier fool of the two.

It was madness once inside. Laurence stood in the center of that enormous place and shouted for them to come. Screamed at the top of his lungs while he undid his collar and let the pale skin of his chest and neck free. He summoned them… And they came. Dozens, hundreds of them leaping from the scaffolding and lurching from the shadows and seemingly appearing from the darkness itself. They were upon him and I could no longer see who was, what was what. I stood by the door we broke to gain entrance, horrified.

I pissed myself, like a babe.

Laurence was laughing, screaming, rallying them until his laughing changed to screaming, to bloodcurdling wailing. He shouted for me to help, shouting for God to save him, shouting for his mother and father and sister who died years ago in a gang attack. Then, there was silence and the horde retreated back into the darkness and shadows, and what remained of Laurence was only his clothes, his jewelry… Not blood, not dust, not a flake of skin.

Laurence was not one who understood that too much of a good thing is awfully bad. And, unfortunately so, he did that night, that terrible, terrible night.




Writing Prompt #83 — Spells, Summons, and Other Sorceries Support
Prompt: Like with technology, there are those who practice magic and don’t fully understand it, you're Magic Support and deal with the issues your clients have regarding magic.

“Hello, thank you for contacting Spells, Summons, & Other Sorceries support. How may I assist you?” I ask.

“Yes, uh— hello— oh God,” he says. I hear heavy breathing, and wind whipping behind his voice. “It’s getting bigger.”

“Hello, sir? What seems to be the problem?”

“Right, right. I was given this book — a big, thick book with metal straps — and, uh— shit!” The whipping grows louder, stronger. Wind comes through the headset, wafting my hair.

“Sir, please continue.”

“Yes, so my great grandpa Merl gave me this book and I read through it — you know, because it’s a book and I was curious — and I found a page about, what I think was, talking about wind. So I—” Wind overwhelmed his voice. Wincing, I keep my eyes closed as a mighty gale blows from the headset through my office, rattling my trinkets and charms, flapping pages of the tomes lining the false-walls. 

“Sir!” I shout, running through the memorized pages of windlore. “You summoned a Wind Deity. If I’m correct, its name is Eurus’oth, the All-Consuming Maelstrom of the East.”

“All consuming!” I barely hear.

“Yes! You must read the last line of the page and recite his name towards the eastern wall three times! Then — and only then — will it be sent back.”

“OK—! Got— book. —page! What was—” The wind completely overtakes his voice. “—it is! OK!
To the East,
From this place—”

A typhoon erupts from the headset. I chuck it onto the floor. Papers and pens and other office supplies spirals out from under the desk, spilling all over the carpet and into the aisle. I grip my dress’s hem and hold it down for dear life. The one day I forgot underwear.

Soon, unexpectedly, the wind gradually peters out until nothing issues from the headset. I cautiously pick it up and slip it back on. “Sir?” I hear nothing. “Sir, are you there?”

“Yes,” he gasps, “yes I’m here.” He laughs. “I did it, it’s gone, sweet Mother of Mary, it’s gone.”
I smile, push my bangs back behind my ears. “That’s wonderful to hear. I’m glad everything worked out for you. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?”

“No, not anymore. Thank you.”

“You’re welcome. Have a good day.”

I hang up but not a moment later, another comes in.

“Hello, thank you for contacting Spells, Summ—”

“OH GOD! IT BURNS! MY SKIN IS MELTING! HELP ME!”























Writing Prompt #84 — A Demon in Disguise
Prompt: A demon was sent to send you to hell disguised as your dog, but it turns out he likes being a dog.

There he is, sitting at the table, eating his disgusting human food.
I trot down the hallway towards him, my freshly cut nails no longer clicking on the hardwood.
Dumb human, too. Just took me in without a second thought. Didn’t bother to wonder if he brought a demon into his home or not.

I stand behind him. He’s munching on something that sounds like breaking pebbles.

No more wasting time.

I brace my four legs. My snout trembles and tears, my bristling shaggy fur standing up. The air teems with energy, electricity. Hellfire courses from my paws and—

“Here boy,” the man says, slurping from his bowl then setting it down on the floor. “Have the rest of my milk.”

Oh?

I stop, everything happening within and outside my body retracts and calms. I slowly walk to the bowl and sniff. Sweet. Chocolaty. I take a lick and my nerves tingle. Oh, this is good. I lap and lap until the bowl’s dry, but I continue to lap to ensure I’ve gotten it all. The man has to take the bowl from me and I bark. He pats my head, it feels wonderful, before he goes and puts the bowl into the sink.

I follow him into another room where he lays down. He pats the cushioned seat by him, and I hop up and lay next to him. He scratches behind my ears, and rubs my stomach. Warmth unlike Hell flows through me with each scratch. Comfortability unlike the Pits of the Damned rings through me with each rub. I feel complete. I feel whole. I feel as if I would die for this human. Oh Satan— oh sweet Lucifer, this is amazing.

Soon he falls asleep, his hand still resting on my stomach. I can’t help my breathing as it matches his. The lull of slumber encroaches over my mind. He’ll live today, but tomorrow, he may… live still. I let my tongue dangle from my mouth as I allow sleep to come.



Writing Prompt #87 — Mr. Young’s Asset
Prompt: You’re a lawyer-wizard who gives objects temporary sentience so they can defend themselves from asset forfeiture. 

“Docket 24-C. Frugus v. Young.” the bailiff said, and stood at the side of the judge’s bench.
The judge rapped her gavel and my client and I stood at our table. “What are we here for today?” she asked, looking down at the case sheet.

“We’re here, Your Honor,” I said, “for an asset dispute of my client, Mr. Young. He’s not with us today. Unfortunately, he passed two nights ago.”

“And what is the asset that is being disputed?”

The other lawyer, an oily, bald man with a suit two sizes too small, rose from his chair. His client sat back and grinned, the fat pockets of his sides bulging between the chair’s armrests. “A commode, Your Honor. My client worked for Mr. Young for years, ever since he was a boy, doing his farm work and tending to his lawn and garden. He has every right to it as Mr. Young’s children.”

“A commode?” the Judge asked.

“Yes,” I said, “a commode; a toilet; a privy; a latrine; a loo; a bog—”

“All right, that’s enough,” the Judge said, waving her hand. “So, the dispute is about a toilet. Why? Why is it so important?”

“Because” the other lawyer jumped in, “it’s one-of-a-kind. Mr. Young has it specially produced in a foreign country. It’s perfectly crafted for—” the lawyer coughed into his hand, grinned, “—for use, Your Honor. It's made from rare materials hardly available today, at least cheaply.”

“And your client, Mr. Frugus, believes he’s owed this?”

“Absolutely. Like I said before, he’s been with the family for decades and has used the asset multiple times. If I’d be so bold, Your Honor, he has an affinity for it.”

The Judge glanced at Mr. Frugus, who smiled, revealing yellowed teeth, and padded his thin, damp hair down. She looked at the file, then me. “So, Mr. Fredrick. It says here that you’re a Lawizard. Is that right?” I nodded. “And, from my understanding, you can give life to objects that normally can’t or shouldn’t have it, is that correct?” I nodded again. “So, really, I don’t need to be involved in this ruling, do I? Please bailiff, bring in the asset.”

The bailiff turned and passed through the doorway in the back of the court. He returned a moment later, pushing a dolly with the asset on top. Its ivory and peridot encrusted frame gleamed under the light, its seat crafted like shallow, silky waves, its tank carved perfectly to support the back of anyone, and had a golden handle. I had never sat upon it but seeing it made me wish I could, wish I could use it for hours. It was placed in the center of the court.

“OK, Mr. Fredrick. Please use your talents on the asset and we’ll let it decide who it will go to.”
“Wait, Your Honor, can we—” the other lawyer tried to say, but the Judge waved her hand. “If an asset can decide on its own, then we should let it.” The lawyer dwindled.

I removed my wand from my briefcase and walked to the toilet. I placed my hand onto the tank, then tapped it five times, in between my fingers. Tiny sparks issued from each point and slithered over the tank, the seat, the base.

Its seat raised. “Hello! Hello! Holy I can talk!”

“Yes, yes, you can talk, now shush.” I said, and turned to the Judge. “Your Honor.”

“All right. Asset,” she said, “we are deciding where you will be placed. Mr. Frugus, over there, says he deserves to own you, says he used you many times before. Would you like to be placed in his home, or with your previous owner’s — Mr. Young — children?”

The toilet scrapped as it slowly turned to Mr. Frugus, who smiled and waved. It began to rattle and tremble. The seat raised, fell, raised again, fell. “God… no. The horrors… The horrors of that man… Even as a boy… God, no! The children! Give me to the children!” Its words became incoherent screams. Quickly I tapped it five times with my wand, and its seat lowered and it was silent.

“Now you see Your Honor, it’s clear the asset wants to be placed with the children.” I said, returning to my table.

“Look here—”

The Judge rapped her gavel. "It’s decided. The asset will be returned to Mr. Young’s children, and Mr. Frugus will not be given the asset. Court adjourned.”

The court was silent as I returned my wand to my briefcase, except for the sobbing of Mr. Frugus, who still sat in his chair, crying into his hands.






































Writing Prompt #89 — The Help from Under the Bed
Prompt: With a large birthmark and an old, antiquated family name, her bullies were vicious. Her mom was getting more depressed, her dad more violent. That’s when, in line with the rest of her tragedy, a grotesque monster came out from under her bed. To her surprise, however, it had come to help.

She sat in bed as the thing clawed at her blankets and floor, wrenching itself free from underneath the bed. She didn’t hide or scream or hardly blink as it bubbled and rose to her ceiling fan. It reeked of rotting oranges, sour strawberries.

The thing turned to her, towering, looming, its flesh rippling and shifting like the surface of the sea. Eyes deep in the wells that must’ve been its head smoldering like old embers, and the couple arms hanging from its sides were thick like tree trunks. It had no legs, nor feet, it was entirely flat, solid, like a wall.

“Aren’t you afraid, my child?” it asked in a heavy, grating breathing, sounding from all sides of the room.

She shook her head.

“Is that so? How come?”

She shrugged, her eyes locking with the creature’s. It stood silently for a few moments, then said, “Ah… You’ve seen worst, been treated the worst… Is that so, my child? What’s a monster to those beyond that door, beyond that moonlit window?”

A flash of recollection crossed her mind. She pulled down the collar of her nightgown and looked at the light red birthmark spilling down her collarbone, her shoulder, her upper back. The girl let the collar go as she looked back at the thing matching its shape.

“Yes, that’s the mark— my mark. Some are touched at birth, my child. You were touched, as you can tell, with your voice gone. It was a trade if you will. I come to those only who need it, even if they’re uncertain they do.”

She thought: What are you going to do?

“Mistreat those who’ve mistreated you, is that not clear?” It stretched over her, blocking out the moonlight coming in through the window. “Now, lay down, close your eyes and dream…” A faint fog drifted from it, smelling of lilacs and daisies. “Dream of places far, far away,” it continued, its husky voice lightening, soothing, “places with endless emerald valleys and aqua skies and lush jungles brimming with small, queer animals.”

Her eyes grew heavy as she inhaled the soft scents tickling her nose, calming her heart. Her eyes closed.

“When you awake; all those beyond that door, beyond that window will be gone, carried to a place like your dream, but one not filled with whimsical wonderment, but with rust and ash, umber and smoke,” was what she heard before she fell into slumber.































Writing Prompt #94 — Genres Coming to Life
Prompt: The first convergence happened years ago. Children’s books began to leak into our world. Years have gone by with the emergence of other genres from high fantasy to dystopian sci-fi. We have managed to learn the next one will appear, Lovecraftian Horror.

We never understood why or how it happened, but we learned to accept and live with it. At first it wasn’t so bad — worlds and what they contained leaked from children’s books. Brightly colored animals, landscapes, candy, and toys and cheery, accepting slogans that made us feel nostalgic and warm. Then, as though whatever this thing was, moved from one aisle in the library to another; other things leaked out from other genres.

Fantasy was next. Trolls shouted, elves carried bows and arrows; knights and warriors and Vikings screamed blood-calls, holding their massive weapons high above their heads. Their worlds came with them, ones with lush, massive forests; groaning mountains eclipsing the sky; swamps bubbling with life dwelling in their depths; shimmering green valleys and plains… 

Then science fiction: ships zipping into space; cyborgs and humans modified by technology, allowing them to teleport and speak foreign languages and see-through walls and fly. Giant things had probed ears and wide, oval gray eyes and slits for noses; short, stubby things with only one ruby eye and wide mouths, stretching endlessly; small, cute things tittering and weaving around the air… 

They were all acceptable. We learned to live with them and they, too. We built zones and fences and other things so each place could have their own section of the world. They were intelligent enough to understand, intelligent enough to allow separation between worlds… But from what the Genretists discovered, the next genre to come was not one we would be able to accept, one that would not accept us.

An author by the name of HP Lovecraft was coming. He wrote about titanic, uncaring gods that are far, far older than time and space itself. These gods will come to life. They would not care who or what we are, or what we have built. They will cause madness, they will cause the end of times, the end of reality as we know it. Gods with inhuman names that feel wrong in the mouth, with names that when spoken it feels more like vomiting than speaking.

But, we’re preparing by reading his work, by understanding the impossible, by hollowing out the earth and building bunkers and the like. These gods may care so little for humanity that they may ignore us, they may see the world as empty save for the specks of life in the earth and drift to another planet or cosmos.

We can only hope, for that’s all we can do. Our minds are the only things we truly have since the genre-leaking began, and if we lose that, we lose everything.






































Writing Prompt #95 — A Vampire Afraid of Flesh
Prompt: You’ve become a vampire, problem is you have issues with physical contact, and biting necks is so intimate… 

“Can you hold your neck out a little more, please?”

The excitement of changing, the rush of adrenaline and fear coursing through my veins; everything has built up to this point immediately stops, like an orgasm wrenched away. I open my eyes and look at him. His pale face nearly glowing under the moonlight, his silver hair shimmering, his wide, red eyes gleaming. “I’m sorry, what?”

He points at me, then returns his hand back under his cloak. “Can you put your neck out more?”
I shake my head. “What do you mean? Why can’t you just do it like I am?”

He smiles, revealing sharp canines, and runs his hand over his forehead, his hair. “Well, uhm… Can you just put it out more for me, please?”

When I turn to him my auburn hair falls back over my neck, covering the spot I so desperately want punctured. “Why can’t you take me as I am? I’ve read your kind love to do that. The touching, the closeness, the intimacy.”

He giggles, looks towards the woods surrounding the park. “Well, you see, miss, I am— I am not one for intimacy of that sort.”

I blurt out a laugh. “Holy— a vampire afraid of flesh.”

His brow furrows, as he glares. “I’m not afraid of it, just… Just not fond of it.”

“Jesus Christ,” I say, slapping my hand on my forehead. “How do you even live if you have to ask people to do this? I can’t believe they’re willing to give up the pleasurable part of it.”

“I’ll have you know that I live just fine,” he says, turning his nose up, “and there’s been plenty of people willing to accommodate my… My affliction.”

“Your affliction?” I laugh. “Give me a break. You’re just afraid of a little skin touching, afraid that those cold dead hands may touch something warm and alive. You’re like a child who wants to play tag but never wants to be ‘it.’ You can’t have one without the other.”

“I’m not a child,” he says, his red eyes beginning to glow. He grits his teeth. “I haven’t been a child for eons.”

“Sure looks like you’re one now,” I say, turning away from him. “Like a child who can’t handle what it's meant to do, meant to be. Doesn’t matter now anyway.” I wave my hand carelessly in the air. “I’ll find a real vampire to turn me, not some trembling ghoul who pisses himself when presented with a little skin.”

What feels like a cab runs over me. Decrypted breath stings my nose and I taste churned soil and rotting corpses. Two hot-brands pierce my neck as claws tear at my gown, dig into my skin, prob at my now burning bones. I moan, shutting while my insides swell and burst and oh God does it feel amazing.

“I’m no child, wench,” I hear him growl as he swallows out the old, spitting in the new. “Never speak it again, or our next encounter will be your last.”

























Writing Prompt #98 — The Therapeutic Succulent
Prompt: For years you’ve talked to your plants as a form of therapy. One day, one of your plants begins to talk back to you sharing its assessment of you.

“It’s just I don’t know what to do anymore,” I said, pacing around the room, “really I don’t. If it’s not one thing, it’s another—”

“Your inability to make decisions has led you to this point, and refusing to make a choice will continuously lead you here.” I heard a wispy voice say from somewhere in my room. I spun around, searching for the voice. “Not with just this decision,” the voice continued, “but all others that will inevitably come in the future.”

“Hello? Who’s there?” I asked, looking from the bed to the closet to the dresser. “Who said that?”

“I have spoken.”

It came from the dresser, near the potted succulent sitting atop.

“Who?” I said.

"I."

It was definitely near the plant. I opened a drawer and ruffled through my underwear. Nothing.

“Who is I?”

“I am I.”

I opened the next drawer, finding nothing there either.

“Can you just tell me who you are?” I spat, straightening, glaring towards the succulent.

“I am speaking.” The succulent’s bright green leaves shook with each word. “I am I.”

I stepped back; the wind pushed suddenly from my lungs. “You— what?” I took a deep breath, exhaled. “You can talk?”

“A lot of species can and do,” it said, leaves jingling.

I ran my hand through my hair, glanced around the room, and looked at the plant. “But… How? Why?”

“I have always been able to speak, but I have chosen not to until this moment. Why? Why is because you have spent many years speaking about your issues and problems with life and I have absorbed them like the water in my soil. You are about to embark on a new chapter in your life, Gary, and I believe that you will need to hear my advice.”

“Oh?” I said, “and what advice can a plant give?”

“My advice is the same as what I said before. You are indecisive and continuously find yourself in predicaments that you are not confident in or knowledgeable of to understand. You make rash decisions due to this, and nearly a hundred percent of the time, they are incorrect. You are anxious and depressed, more so the former than the latter. You are young but not young enough for it to be an excuse. You will move out from this place and have your own house, and that frightens you but you believe you will be fine because the other people of your race have done it and continue to do it without much issue. But the fear is still there and—”

I snatched the plant from my dresser, and stomped over to the trash bin and chucked it in.

“Throwing me away Gary will not solve the problems that you have, especially the ones of intimacy you’re currently having with Megan—”

I wrenched the trash bag from the bin, tied it tight, then opened the window. The cold wind bit my warm skin. I still heard the plant through the plastic. “And, yet you still continue to make rash decis—”

That’s all I heard it say before I tossed it outside and slammed the window shut.

If I had wanted a therapist, I would’ve gone to one.









Writing Prompt #100 — What’s Dead Remains Dead
Prompt: You are a necromancer who secretly helps the police by bringing back the spirits of murder victims so you can question them about their deaths.

Dave and Tommy roll a body in on a metal gurney. The steel double-doors close behind them. Their police shields clipped to their belts gleam briefly under the bright fluorescence as they push the body underneath it.

“We got ‘nother, Nate,” Dave says, stepping away from the gurney. Tommy follows suit.
“I see that,” I say, sliding a bookmark into the book I was reading, and set it onto the steel counter. I slide off the stool and walk over to the corpse. “And what do you want to know this time, boys?”

“He was stabbed to death—” Tommy begins, but I wave him off.

“I asked what you want to know, not how he died.” I look down at the bumpy white sheet draped over the metal bed. Splotches of red seep through near the man’s abdomen.

“We wanna know what we always do,” Dave says, “how he exactly died and who killed him. He was a very important man and—” I wave him off, too, like his partner.

“Doesn’t matter who he was, is, or what he’ll become.” I look through the blaring light. “Just be quiet and don’t interrupt. Remember what happened last time? You still have those nightmares, Tommy?”

His pudgy face beads in sweat. He wipes his forehead, stares at the ground. “Not.. not as much.”
I nod. “Good, good.” I look at Dave. “And you? How’s the bleeding?”

He shifts his weight, hooks his hands in his pockets. “Better, doesn’t hurt as much going to the bathroom, but… Doc says it’ll heal in a couple weeks.”

“Wonderful, wonderful.” I look back down at the corpse. “Let’s begin.”

I rip the white sheet off the man. His brown hair wafts and settles. His pale skin matches the dozen other corpses I’ve handled. The multiple stab wounds in his side still ooze congealing blood. I remove the scalpel from the workbench and quickly etch thin symbols down his limbs and around his belly button. I toss the bloodied scalpel back onto the bench, and take the tub of baby fat and paintbrush and gently draw a wavering line of fat around the symbols until they all meet at the belly button. I still find it odd it smells like butter. I take the scalpel again, and cut a seam in the center of the lines of baby fat, ending at the man’s middle.

After setting it back down, I press my fingers in a tub of ashes and run them along the lines, whispering words long forgotten by people. With every gibbering syllable, the overhead light darkens, darkens, darkens, flickers, goes out. The white cement walls rattle. My words echo into the abyss pressing upon the room, reverberate off the arching, all-encompassing vertebrate of the dwelling gods. A dark haze veils my vision and my nerves ignite with flames, licking the insides of my flesh.

The overhead light swings, the tools on the table are shaking, the glass cases filled with tools and ancient books are trembling violently. The palpable air swells, vacuuming around the corpse and I. Sweat pours from under my arms. I shout the last word and press my thumb to the man’s navel and lapis flames erupts from the baby fat, seeping into the center seam, spreading to the symbols, which glow ruby and amethyst. His chest shutters, shutters, then he sits up and Dave and Tommy scream although they’ve seen this a dozen times.

I stand back, the light flickers back on, and the world steadies. I exhale and wipe my hands on my pants, and run my arm over my forehead. “All right, his spirit’s back,” I say, “now get your answers and get out.” I move back to my stool, pick up and open my book, removing the bookmark. Tommy and Dave’s voices dwindle to a whisper as the man learns to use his mouth again, learns to talk again, learns to comprehend the world. It’s a slow process — always is — but soon he gets the handle of it and the police get what they want.

I glance up from my book as Tommy moves around the man and holds down his shoulders, and Dave takes out the hexed Glock he always carries. People are made of routines. The man starts to fight back, screaming, crying, but Dave’s quick, pressing it to the man’s temple and pulling the trigger. No mess, no blood. The bullet rattling inside the brain doesn’t damage its physical innards, just the spirit. What’s physical is dead and remains so, even when resurrected.
With a wave, the boys in blue leave and I return to my book.

I’ll deal with it later.
