Chapter 1

At the beginning there was darkness, and in that darkness a tiny speck of light appeared. One light made of seven. And they were all created equal at the beginning.
The Book of answers, prologue

There were once seven brothers. Seven equals in strength and might. And they were all made to work together in unison to make the world beautiful and interesting. But then one decided he was needed no more and there has been enough work on his side. So he rested and stopped taking care of his realm. His people called for him for centuries until they gave up.
The other one finished his work and fell to sleep, leaving his people to tend for them. They dreamed about him and about the time when he shall wake again, but his sleep was too deep for their voices.
A third and a fourth, the young twins, took one-half of the single realm each and held them as they wished, taking small if any role in the affairs of other brothers.
The fifth and the sixth held their part of the burden with a heavy hand, thinking of the past, present and future at the same time. Making their lands grow and prosper.
The seventh one watched over them with a jealous eye, for his land was cold and dark, and that cold and darkness crept upon his soul, and his heart became as the land he held - frozen and hard, lifeless. 
In his fort under the frozen mountains, he decided to take the prosperous lands of his brethren and make them his own. It took him millennia, but at the end, he held the realms of the sleeping brethren, prolonging their sleep and keeping them from hearing their people. 
He coerced the twins to work on his behalf, they thought it was the best for all, and he took a foothold on the fifth brother's land. This is the story of the final days, the story of the end or of the beginning. We cannot know, we can only play our part of the game.


Chapter 2

And the heir shall come, renouncing his heirloom, discarding the servants, gold, and jewels. Forgetting the throne and forfeiting material possessions. It shall be the day when angels welcome their new guest.
The Book of answers, vol. 13, chapter 4

1204, Constantinople, Church of Holy Wisdom

It was cold in the corridors by the Kellies. Tapestries on the walls were giving out the impression of warmth but he knew that the walls behind were radiating winters chill. Why was he summoned eluded him, but he had an idea of his own desires and wishes. Ever since his father died, some three years ago, his only wish and desire were to raise Serbian church to independence. But, no matter how hard he tried and how much effort he placed into it, there seemed to be no outcome. Saint Simeon, as his father became known, gave him specific instructions where to lead his people. His older brother Stefan became the ruler of the nation, and he became the ruler of the religion. Vukan was mostly unimportant, given the smaller holds and provinces, although the eldest of them. Sava loved both his brothers, but Vukan was unable to understand more than what he saw before him. Stefan was far better at it. As for himself, he never desired more than his peace and solace. It was his choice to live in the monastery. And now he was summoned before the Patriarch of Constantinople, the Ecumenical one, John the tenth. There was no question whether to comply or not, there was only the question of the task he shall receive.
Pondering upon these thoughts, lightly shivering with cold, Sava waited.
-  His holiness shall see you now. Please enter. – The voice was soft and husky, almost feminine – Wait until spoken to.
- Thank you, my brother, I’ll make sure to obey.
The room was plain and without much furniture. There was only a simple desk, bed without any decorations, a candle and two chairs. The only hint of luxury was around the icon on the wall, with an ornate cresset under it, all made of gold and jewels. As if the inhabitant of this kelia was deliberately trying to show interest only in spiritual matters and not in material ones.
Sava entered, walked up to the chair and waited. Large tapestry on the opposite wall, showing an angel descending onto a group of people on their knees, lightly moved aside and a small figure clad in black appeared. 
- Good evening brother Sava. I’ve been hoping you’ll come, although on such a short notice and in these treacherous times there was no certainty…
- Your holiness, when you need any of us there is no doubt. Thank God, and all the good people he sent, it was fairly easy to come.
- Yes, yes… thank God… do sit please, would you like some tea? It is rather chilly here, and we seldom indulge ourselves with extra heat. 
 -Of course, your holiness, a cup of tea would be very satisfying.
Without apparent invitation, another monk appeared carrying a wooden tray with two clay mugs and a pitcher. The young man placed them on the table and left. John poured one of the mugs but left his untouched.
- Here you are. It’s a good combination of herbs, from Athos, one of your monks makes it and it takes a great deal of efforts to get it from him. Did you know that he grows all the herbs himself?
- I know him your holiness; some of the herbs for this tea only grow if he tends to them. On one occasion he left Mount Athos for a period of time. Half of his garden immediately dried out. As if nothing ever grew there. Few weeks later, we have already given up on it, the herbs started sprouting. That very same evening he came back to the monastery.
- Strange powers are indeed granted to the monks of Athos. God truly loves you.
- We are but humble servants your holiness; whatever he decides to give we share equally among all…
- Yes, yes, I know. One thing, tough, was given to us. Specifically, it was given to me.


Chapter 3

Time of the change is near. What was once great, now is getting smaller, what was once small shall get its chance of greatness. Time of the change is near and the veils are thin.
The Book of answers, vol. 21, chapter 3

2003, Belgrade, banks of river Sava

- Bistro! Does it bite?
- Surely. We brought special worms, Californian!
Fishing was great these days. Lots of the sunshine and low water has brought a lot of fish to the state where they’ll take any bait available. Mitar and Jovan were sitting on their foldable chairs, and another empty one was already set. Bistro was the word used by fishermen to greet each other, meaning clear waters in our language. It was used to avoid jinxing.
- Come on Peter, we’ve been waiting for you.
- Great, I have a surprise for you. Just to show my appreciation.
- Wow! This is Homemade? What’s it made of?
- Plum, the last bottle from the fall. 
- Pity, it was very good.
- I’ll bring some more next weekend. Tonight I’m traveling to Sokobanja and I’ll make sure to buy some more. Perhaps I’ll find something even better.
- Hardly better than this, but some herbal brandy would be nice… cheers!
- Cheers, my friend, to your health!
For his friend, I was a traveling merchant. Bought goods in provinces and sold them in Belgrade at higher rates of the back of my car. Of course, they had special discounts on account of their friendship and there was always something extra for them. Some things I didn’t care to sell but only gave away to my neighbors and friends. Fortunately, for them, they had no knowledge of my real occupation.
I sat with them, took some bait on a hook and started fishing. The quiet was almost tangible, none of us speaking as it was customary during fishing. They were both in their own thoughts, perhaps forming a fisherman’s tale for this evening in a pub. About fishing out the largest carp, they’ve ever seen but it just took the bait and swam off. I had another thing to ponder. A call I received earlier informed me about a need for my service. And my service was secret to most people, except those who had to be informed. Usually monks and elders, but every once in a while there was a young man unrelated to clergy inviting me to come. A tiny, girlish voice called me to come as soon as possible.
- Hello, is that Peter I am speaking to?
- Yes, how may I assist you? I must inform you that my supplies are a bit low and there is not much I can provide…
- I’m not calling about the merchandise. In fact, if everything goes well, I’ll stock your supplies with all you wish.
- What are you calling about then?
- Your other service. One you were sworn upon.
Of course. One I was sworn upon, one I could not deny. In fact, my father told me that I wasn’t just sworn, but rather born for. I gathered my tools of the trade, emptied the car of all but necessary and came to Sava River to spend this afternoon with friends. It was a small ritual for me since there is bound to come one invitation that’ll not come out good, there’s bound to be something I cannot do. So, I enjoyed one last day as much as was possible. One of those is going to truly be the last one.
- Peter! Where are you? It’s biting!
I pulled hard on my rod and surely there was a fish on a hook. By the feel of the fight, it was a large one. Good, that meant sweet fatigue after the fight and a tasty fish stew these two guys were famous for. Just for the perfect end of the day. 
With a wide grin, I pulled and fought on.



Chapter 4

Walls can be broken, but the effort is great. The veils are thin and easily movable. Close the doors, stop the draft – if you don’t, they’ll enter.
The Book of answers, vol. 21, chapter 3

2003, A village, somewhere near Sokobanja

Easy ride. No problems whatsoever. I stopped near one of the gas stations by the freeway for a refill. Not just for the fuel, but also some water and some rest. The guy at the station was engaged in a conversation with another customer and I overheard a joke being told. It was customary for Serbia to start a friendly chitchat with just about anybody one meets. Otherwise, he could consider you rude. Leaning on the pump, basking in sunshine, I could feel this positive energy flowing into my body, almost tangible feeling of power. Not just a trickle or dripping, but the free flow of joy and warmth. Good, I thought, I’ll need it before this night is over.
My directions were simple enough; tough I’ve never been here before there was a familiar feeling. Almost as if the road was welcoming me. As if I was just an old friend returning from a long journey. To me this feeling was not unfamiliar, all roads and forests of the country recognized me. The only discomfort was in cities and abroad. Like mythical Antaeus, son of Gaia, who gained his strength from the very Earth. Only this was true just for this country. I was part of this country, just like my ancestors were born to serve the land and its people.
Driving slowly, I could see the tiny figure from far. It was standing at the edge of the dirt road my Lada Niva was simply flowing across. Clad in brown and gray, with a cloud of raven hair covering the face. I stopped the car, rolled the window down and asked:
- Hi boy, is this the road to Rtanj? – The figure stood still for a moment and replied – It depends.
- Depends on what? It was a rather simple question.
- Well, technically you’re already ON Rtanj but if you continue further there’s a fork in the road. If you take left you’ll be able to, sort of, leave the mountain. But, if you take right then who knows? Maybe you’ll get there, maybe not…
- Puzzling. What would you do in my place?
- I’d ask me to come along and show you the way. And if you ask I could tell you whom you must meet.
- Ah, it was you inviting me?
- Again, it depends. I was the one to make the call, but the real invitation came from another. Or something like that.
- Hop in.
As the boy climbed in I noticed, to my surprise, that it was not really a boy but a woman. Actually, she was a very young and skinny girl whose breasts were barely showing. She was dressed in wool and hemp garments, clearly homemade, and a pair of traditional pigskin shoes. For a moment, there was nothing in my mind I could ask her, but then I composed myself.
- Forgive me; I mistook you for a boy.
- Common mistake, nothing to it. It really doesn’t matter, I’m the only child born in these parts for the last fifty years. My grandparents raised me practically as a boy.
- Why?
- I’m not sure, perhaps they didn’t know better?
My face must have looked strange because she laughed heartily and I could see the pearly whites shining under the grayest eyes I’ve ever seen. So gray they almost looked transparent.
- I’m sorry, but your face reminded me of Mr. Bean for a moment. I’m the only child because all young people left for the cities, only the elder remained. My mother showed up at the monastery doors one day, fainted and never woke up. She was pregnant with me and lived only until I was born. The villagers took me in and rose as one of their own. 
- You know about Mr. Bean?
- I live in a village, not in a cave. We have TV here.
- What about the police? What did they say?
- Nobody informed them. My grandmother reported childbirth as her own and legally I’m her daughter. It was even in the papers…
I remembered reading an article about the oldest mother in Serbia some twenty years ago. I was still young and only starting my career as an investigator. A strange professional choice for a boy that only just left school and gets suspicious looks when ordering drinks in a bar. Perhaps there’s more to this story than usual. My face must’ve shown some of my thoughts since she had to ask:
- You think there’s something strange here? Some foul play?
- Well, can’t blame me. You know what I am; after all, it was your voice on the phone even you claim it was someone else inviting me…
- I do know, but I must tell you there’s nothing strange about me. The abbot gave his best to check me out, and my grandmother did some things of her own. Some things her mother taught her, as her mother taught her before, and so on…
- The Old Lore?
- The Old Lore. Of course, I’m not on your level of power, but strong enough. I’m just a girl. There is nothing more and nothing less.
I could not tell her then what I’ve learned later, but I’m not sure I would have even if I’ve known. Sometimes and for some creatures that is all that is needed. Just a girl, nothing more and nothing less is needed.


Chapter 5

Dark is the night, but the Pit is even darker. Hold your light steady and do not tremble. For as long as you don’t tremble – they shall.
The Book of answers, vol. 13, chapter 5

1205, Mount Athos, Hilandar monastery

- Bless, Your Grace.
- May the Lord bless you, my son. Is everything ready for our departure?
- Yes, Your Grace. As you instructed. We heralded your arrival to your brothers, they’ll be waiting.
- Good, good. Lord has instructed us to bring peace to our country. Both I and my father are ready to fulfill His will. There are only faith and good intentions in this journey.
- Great is the Lord, and great is our departed brother Simeon. Even now he watches over us…
- Yes, my son. Even now, and forever. Someday he’ll welcome all of us at our Father’s garden. Go now, and wait for me to prepare for the journey.
Young monk departed quietly and Sava remained alone with his thoughts. It has been a very troubling year for him. Ever since that last conversation with the Patriarch of Constantinople, he was trying to understand everything that was told to him. To grasp all the information he heard about the expansion and imminent fall of the Byzantine Empire. Information that spoke about the future of his little country, about the growth of the Empire under one of his descendants. And about the fall of it. All the hardship bestowed upon him and his people, and all the rewards that are going to be given if they hold steady. And the words were hard and cold, like the stone walls around him, stating the facts in a way that there was not a shred of doubt about the truth in them. It was an absolute, undeniable and unchallengeable divine statement. His land shall rise, his descendant shall be the emperor, and his bloodline shall be destroyed. It held no worries for him. He was certain that Lord knows what’s best. What did worry him were two things given unto him by the Byzantine Patriarch. One was the heavy trunk now tied between two horses, and the other was a strange monk in black that kept to himself and stayed quiet. Not that his silence was unheard of, many monks were vowed on silence, just that it was clear to Sava that this one wasn’t. He couldn’t say why he had that feeling, but he knew that this monk held no vows. He just wasn’t asked the right question yet.
With heavy thoughts, he stood up and went towards the yard. There was great joy in this journey, returning the remains of his father Simeon to the motherland and reuniting his brothers. And there was a great sadness in the knowledge that he shall not see this monastery for the next decade or so. Having rebuilt it, Sava felt it was more like his home than any other place in the world. But, what must be done cannot be left waiting.
- Are you ready Your Grace?
- Yes, I am, my son. Let us get going, no time like now.
- It shall be a long and perilous voyage; we bear no arms and little protection.
- We have the supreme protection from our Lord. He set this journey for us and we must take it. Have no fear my son, we are better protected than any other traveler nowadays.
- I have no fear Your Grace; I’m safe with you and your father.
With these words echoing in his mind, Sava left the monastery. 


Chapter 6

Fear not my son, fear is not yours. Hold your faith and be steady, if you do so I’ll be with you always and forever.
The Book of answers, vol. 21, chapter 3

2003, A village, somewhere near Sokobanja

Things happened too fast for me to follow. We were driving along the dirt road when a large tree suddenly broke about two meters above the ground and fell in front of us. There was no time for breaks, I just pushed my legs in front of me and embraced the collision. On an afterthought, it was a bit strange the way that tree broke. Once I saw a karate master break a plank in a similar way – as if his hand was a sword. But this was ridiculous; this one should’ve been over three meters tall to do so. And probably even wider in shoulders than I was, and I was pretty bear like. For a moment, there was a brisk movement in the woods and then there was red mist on my eyes and blessed oblivion.
When I came to, I was in a bed. The walls around me looked ancient and were made of stone blocks larger than my backpack. It must’ve been a monastery, there were no other buildings around constructed like that. And it had to be an old one, probably from the period of Turkish invasion. There was a simple wooden table, a glass of water and some grapes on it, and an unlit candle. It was a yellow candle, made of natural wax. Not a good sign by the bed. It meant that I was so close to death that somebody around thought it was a good idea to prepare it in case I needed a light during my departure. Of course, to confirm, there was an icon on the wall and a simple cresset. Saint Cosmas and Damian, healers. So, this was the room for the ill and injured. Good. It helped.
I stood up, looked around for my clothes but didn’t find them. Instead, there were simple clothes like the ones the girl had. Peasant clothes, simple but clean. After a bit of struggle getting them on, I lit the flame in the cresset to honor the saints and opened the door. For a while, wondering through the corridors, I came to a larger room and felt the faint smell of cooking. Surely, that was a dining room. To say I was immediately hungry could be called the understatement of the year. I felt like there was a bottomless pit where my stomach should’ve been.
- Ah, you’re awake my son, praised be the Lord. We had some doubts about it. For a while, we thought that He decided to take you…
- Fortunately, He did not. I guess there is more for me to do here, father. Might I trouble you for some of that divine cooking I can smell, and a few answers during the meal?
- You have a good nose my son; the food is just about to be served. You’re welcome to join us, although there shall be only vegetarian meals since it is Friday, but for the answers, you’ll have to wait. It is not our custom to speak during meals.
Yeah. Friday meant I’ve been out for three days. No wonder they thought I’ll die. I sat down and enjoyed the wonderful tastes of the solid food I was given. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a carnivore by belief but I do enjoy food without meat or dairy products. In our faith, we fast for a better part of the year and I’m used to it. Things that can be made edible without meat are vast and tasty. Well, some things I had to eat during my life have been anything but edible, but these were simply fantastic.
After a while, when I was the only one at the table still eating, awkward silence reminded me to stop. There was no hunger left; I just ate for the taste. I stopped, crossed my spoon over the plate, to indicate I’m finished and turned towards the abbot.
- Thank you for this food, father. And thank you for taking care of me during these couple of days.
- The Lord is to be thanked my son, both for the food and for your health. But there have been more than a couple of days. You’ve been almost dead for ten days.
This struck me as a sledgehammer. Ten days! What had happened to the girl? What had happened to my car? Most importantly, what about my task? Am I too late now, should I start to worry? I asked all those questions out loud. Must have been so, since the answers came anyway.
- Your car was not badly damaged, just a few bumps and a hole in the radiator. Of course, we have no means to fix it, but we’ll gladly provide a tow with monastery tractor once you decide to leave. Morana, the girl that waited for you, has disappeared. She knows the forest well; we hoped she might come here but to avail. We searched for her but found no clue.
- Do you know why have I been summoned here?
- Well, some tales find their way to my ears, but I choose not to take them seriously. You should know - my vocation does not comply with certain folk beliefs. In my former life I’d have known what to say but now I can only direct you to her grandparents.
- That would be fine, I’m sure I could find my way around but if there is somebody to guide me…
- Say no more, I’ll send a monk with you. Brother Stefan will gladly assist.

*****

An hour later, we were walking merrily along the forest track. If there wasn’t for the nagging feel of pressure on the back of my head I could almost feel as a tourist hiking through the woods during my holiday. But the feel of somebody’s eyes watching me was overwhelming. Almost like a gentle pressure pushing my head forward. I knew that it was surely true – somebody was monitoring my every step, appraising me and trying to make a conclusion about my presence here. Somebody. Or something. I was a believer, and I respected my religion, but that didn’t mean I was stupid. Just because you don’t believe in something did not mean it can’t kill you. Or worse.
My silent guide was surefooted, not a single branch cracked under his feet, not a leaf was moved. I shook his hand when we met so I’ve known he was corporeal, but the way he moved suggested something more about him.
- When did you join the monastery?
- A long time ago.
- How long? You don’t seem very old, I’d say no more than twenty-twenty two…
- I’m older than that.
- How much older?
There was no answer to that. He seemed undisturbed. I knew he heard me and I knew that he chose to remain silent. Ok. No problem. I can wait for a while. I’m very patient. 
- How old are you?
- Enough.
- Old enough?
- No. Enough questions. I answer only what I must.
Ah, the silent one. Words come from God and at the beginning was the word and so on. Don’t misuse the words and you won’t say something to regret later. Personally, I liked the girl better. She made puzzles, but at least, she spoke. Come to that, I remembered something funny. For that entire ride, I’ve never asked her for her name. Old abbot had to tell it to me, and I felt no need to know it before.
- What about Morana? Do you know her or her folks?
- No.
Wow. A genuine guru. Master of words.
The forest suddenly opened up in front of us and I was able to see the village. No more than a dozen of buildings, about a half with the appearance of vacant space. Stefan led to me to one of them, knocked on the door and waited. It opened up just enough for an old man to peek out.
- You? Why did the abbot send you?
- God help you old man. I brought a visitor.
- Thank you. Let him come in.
Stefan moved a bit and raised his right arm showing me the door. Then he turned and, without even a goodbye, left back to the trail we came by. I watched his back until he walked into the forest and then turned towards the old man.
- Marry monk, isn’t he? We had quite a conversation along the way.
- Strange kid, I tell you. It’s a miracle he even recognized your existence. I haven’t heard more than ten sentences from him since I first saw him. Do come in, there some bread and salt, and some brandy. We’ll speak after.
I walked in and looked around. It was a simple village house. One level, wooden floor and ceiling, a single space contained the kitchen, living room, and guest room all in one. I could see a door to the corridor, no doubt leading towards the bathroom and some bedrooms. Probably no more than two of them, one for the old couple and one for the girl. Morana, I had to start using her name in my mind, strange how it slipped around as if she’s not real.
- Did you summon me here?
- No Peter. My wife did. I’m just an old man and there’s nothing more to me. She’s the one you must help. She, and our granddaughter. I guess you’ve met Morana?
- I did, but she left after the crash. I was out cold for ten days and there’s no way to know anything about her now.
- She didn’t leave. She was taken.
Old woman’s voice was deep and raspy. It sounded like the voice of a heavy smoker, only it came from a body not much bulkier than Morana’s. One moment before she wasn’t in the room with us, no doors opened, and the next minute she was here. As if she was here all the time but I didn’t notice her. The old man left the house without words and there were just the two of us. I shivered slightly.
- Don’t be afraid my child, what’s there to fear from? An old lady like me? – The words were kind and soft, but the smile vas positively serpentine.
- What are you, mother? You know what I am, but I’m at a loss here.
- I’m just an old crone, but thank you for thinking there’s more to me.
- I’ll ask again mother, what are you?
- A wife, a grandmother, a cook, whatever you need my son.
- For the third time, I ask. Now you must answer, what are you?
- A dragon’s daughter. I must answer when asked tree times, but you should feel lucky that the answer came by words. If you hadn’t called me mother there would be trouble.
A dragon’s daughter. I’ve known the custom - ask tree times if you need the answer but beware how you ask. By calling her mother, I made an obligation not to hurt me. A mother never hurts. 
- And your husband?
- He’s merely a human. Although, quite a long time ago he was the strongest man in these parts. Strong enough to wrestle wild bears in the forest and come out victorious. That’s how we came to be together – I saw him one night and fell in love. My father opposed, but I came here with him and shared my years.
- How old are you?
- Very old, we live a long time and my husband shared some of that life. Now that time is at an end and we must part. He’ll die as all mortals do and I’ll go back to the mountain where my father lives.
- And Morana?
- That’s why I called for your help. She must be taken away from here. I taught her all I’ve learned from my ancestors, given her a lot of magic and force, but she’s just a mortal like my husband. There was no help, I love her as my child and there’s no way for me to have a child of my own with any mortal. She is the only thing still holding me here. If my father learns about her she’s doomed.
Yeah. A dragon would never allow for a mortal to know his powers. Dragons were common once, protectors of land and forests, everlasting and powerful. I’ve been taught about them but never actually met one. Proven by me being here, well, to ponder upon it. They had some notion of people as a danger to nature, I can’t really say why. The very notion of a mortal wielding that kind of power would enrage him beyond reason. 
- What about her mother?
- Oh, just some wondering woman, doesn’t really matter. She died giving birth and I took the child from the monks. They were ever so happy to oblige me.
No wonder. To live so near such a dangerous creature was horrifying; being able to please her was something they had to be glad for. There was a strange notion about the way she dismissed my question about Morana’s mother but I had no intention to further it. By the look on her face, it seemed she had no intention of her own for it.
- All right. I’m ready to hear the story and I’ll help in any way I can.
- A wise decision my son. One I hoped for.


Chapter 7

A king is an ultimate servant. He alone stands at the door; choosing for his people. It is upon his soul to lead them – to heaven or hell, they all follow. Therefore, when he passes, close the door behind him for there is no retreat.
The Book of answers, vol. 13, chapter 17

1217, Kraljevo, Monastery Zica

Sava was sitting alone in the dark of his room. Ten years have passed, peace was upon his land. His brothers agreed upon it after his arrival, of course, due to the things he told them. Not all of his knowledge was shared, but just enough for them to be satisfied. It is not prudent to speak about demise to the kings for they are vain and proud. So, he only told them about the future dynasty, about the greatness waiting in the future, about the saint giving lineage of their blood. Proud as his brothers were, they could recognize the meaning behind the words, but chose not to pursue further. Vukan agreed not to wage war upon his brother and allow Stefan to become the first king of Serbia. This very monastery was chosen to be the place of crowning future kings and for that purpose a new door was opened in the walls of the monastery. Once his brother used them, they were bricked back in, to create future symbolic of no retreat and no backing on the king’s decisions. For the future rulers, new doors shall be opened and closed back again, allowing only one entrance and showing only one way.
More importantly, political influence was spread far away to ensure the independence of Serbian Church. To create strong and willing force of belief. This was, truly, the main purpose of all new flare. To solidify the nation in order to create a barrier for the thing safely locked in that trunk Sava brought from Constantinople. The thing that spends it’s time trying to break free, and being held locked only by constant prayers and strength of faith around it. His silent partner warned Sava about the dangers and powers of that artifact, explaining and guiding him in the protection of humanity. All around the country schools and churches were built to ensure that prayer will hold the lid in place. Sava insisted on seeing the lid opened, and the monk allowed it, but only after years of prayer in this monastery. He said that the thing is dormant enough to allow a quick glimpse of its appearance in the material world for the most important priest in the land.
They went to the basement alone. The basement completely hidden and locked to anyone saves the king and the Archimandrite. The trunk itself had no locks, the monk marked them obsolete since there were no material locks that can hold evil enclosed. Only faith and prayer could do so. He pushed the lid up and Sava saw the content of it, immediately wishing he didn’t do so. When the lid was replaced, the monk turned and spoke the longest story so far. He spoke about himself and his duty. He was the sentinel sent from heaven to be the counterweight to the fallen one – to guard the trunk and its content and to warn the people about their faith. He alone had great powers but he alone was not enough. The free will that was given to human race obliged him to act as the people decide – if the majority wanted the trunk opened, it would be opened. He was there to explain the truth, to say the warning and leave.  After that, he did leave, disappearing for Sava and other monks, leaving them to attend to their service.
Soon he will also leave; there are places and grounds to be covered. There are faith and sermons to be spread. Words to be spoken. His brother and his descendants shall stay to preserve it, but his duty was elsewhere. There had to be a legend, there had to be a figure, and there had to be something greater than himself. Kings come and go, the faith remains.
Until such time when the cup shall pass to another. Until such time, his people shall finally be free of this divine blessing and duty.

2003, A cave in the forest

A cave like any other. Dark entrance, scant bushes around it, darkness lurking from within. I stood in front of it, holding only my pack and several items that were proven to be protective. The old woman told me what to expect and how to behave, explained all about the need to be brave, and the need to be polite. As if I had no knowledge of it. After all, I did have to survive in the hard circumstances of being an honest citizen of the country where it wasn’t really appreciated. Her words were still clear in my mind.
- My father is a dragon. That much I’ve told you already. He is the lord Protector of this region and everything is under his command. Forest, mountain, waters and animals. He allows people to live here due to an old promise he gave to a Tsar, but he does that reluctantly. You see, the Tsar is long dead and the people are not the same as it was, but for a dragon time has no meaning. His promise burns as brilliantly now as if it was just spoken. But that doesn’t mean he’ll allow you to enter his domain as if it was just another building. You’ll have to prove yourself through tree tasks. Tree, since it is a magical number for us. Just like I was obliged to give you the truth after tree repeated questions, you have to complete tree tasks to prove yourself worthy of the dragon’s attention. A task of the body, mind, and soul. In that order. The first task shall be the easiest – just to enter his dimension. You have the potential and the knowledge. The second is harder, but I can give you something that is needed to complete it. The third one is the hardest and I hold no knowledge of it since it is different for each visitor. You’ll have to be worthy or not. I hope you are.
- And when I reach him? How does a mere mortal speak to a dragon? Won’t he burn me with his breath?
- O, stupid one! – She said impatiently – You think the dragons are like the ones you see in the moving pictures and illusions the world gave you! My father looks just like any other human, granted, he is a being of exceptional beauty by your standards. Dragons do not use scales and fire to intimidate. They have no need for it. Their will is all they need if my father wishes something material to happen, it shall. It is your mind that chooses the punishment.
- So, how did this Tsar come to force him upon a promise?
- My father is omnipotent in the material world, but he is bound to his decisions. One night he decided it would be fun to roam the forest in the likeness of a bear and he came upon a man. This man challenged him to a fight which my father lost. As a reward, he offered anything to him.
- Was this man your husband? – A quick thought came to my stupid tongue.
- No, but I can understand why you thought so. This man was the greatest man of your history, taller and stronger than all of his contemporaries, a man of great power and even greater demise.
- What did he ask for?
- Fire. He asked for fire. And my father gave it to him. He gave him his promise that no army will ever be stronger than his for as long as he lives, and that his people shall forevermore carry that flame within them. That’s why he allows you to do what you wish – most of you still hold the dragons flame in your bodies.
- What is it that you want me to do?
- Go to my father and speak to him. I fear Morana is already in his realm and if so then she is beyond any assistance, but if a mortal proves worthy he can ask for anything. Go to my father and plea for Morana’s life. Nothing more.
And now I’m standing in front of the cave waiting for my guts to soften a bit and allow me to enter. I knew what this meant. My first task was to leave this dimension and enter the world between, the fairy lands, the Nevernever. Call it what you wish, it was the space where Heaven, Hell, and our world intersected. Where all with enough knowledge could enter under right circumstances, and where no laws were applicable except the ones made by the despot of the particular region. That is to say – the strongest will in the region decided the rules. The region used just as a word, in Between space had no meaning; region could hold a couple of meters or space larger than Earth. Whatever the ruler considered important.
You could enter Between wherever you wished, but to enter the particular realm you had to know the right spot. Once there, you could easily see all realms and their entrances, but from the “real world”, nothing was obvious. In my time, I barged into some really messy places trying to use the Between as a way to escape the trouble. This particular entrance was marked by the old lady, so at least, I knew what I’m getting into.
Being what I am, there were no special chants and rules and whatnots to be used. My will was enough to rip the veil of reality and reveal a grand gate to me. Made of gold and silver, ornate intricately with small images and pictograms, and very ominously closed. I stepped forward, feeling the change into the form my body asked for in this dimension. My shirt disappeared allowing the wings under my armpits to show and my muscles redoubled to conform to my will. Appearance was all in this world, most fights ended before they started just because one looked intimidating. And here I really did, although I was nothing short of intimidating in my world either. The wings were not my idea, but it seemed that Between had its own quirks.
As I drew closer, the pictograms on the gate became clearer and I could see they were actually images of people doing a lot of things. And I mean a lot. Some of the pictures were blatantly embarrassing. A thin line in the middle vertical was barely visible, dividing left and right sides of the gate in a very interesting manner – it seemed that opening the door would break apart the action in a way that left two different actions on either side. For example, a couple on one of the pictograms seemed to hold a baby together in love as a family. If the gate would open one would hold the child and the other would remain reaching for the sky. There was no lock or latch, nothing to use to open the door. Politely, I knocked. Once, twice, thrice.
It opened. Outwards.


Chapter 9

If your spirit is strong then no darkness and no shackles can hold you captive. Only within that spirit, true freedom lies.
The Book of answers, vol. 14, chapter 30

1330, near Velbazhd, eve of the battle

Young king Dushan rode through the camp. His army was ready for the battle and well prepared. Of course, they were. Ever since he returned to Serbia from exile with his father the war seemed to be unending. First with his uncle Konstantin, then with his cousin Vladislav. It took his father four years to become the undisputed king of all Serbian lands.  Then came the trouble with Dubrovnik, followed by problems with Bosnia but this war was the worst. At the same time, Bulgarian despot Shishman had divorced Dushan’s aunt Anna to marry Byzantine princess Theodora. A political union, of course, created in an attempt to use joined forces of Byzantium and Bulgaria to stop the rise of Serbian power and influence. It would’ve probably worked had it not been for the great power of this army. So, the reason for war became the source of our victory. Tomorrow they’ll march to the battlefield and finish with these attempts.
But for this night, young king had other plans. He was in his early twenties, towering above many other for almost half a meter, and full of strength. For a pastime, he used to go out into the forest and hunt wild animals carrying nothing more than a long knife and his bare hands. Tonight he intended to do the same, find himself a worthy opponent in nature and see if that could give him a kind of prophecy for tomorrow’s events.
He left his horse to a soldier and went alone into the woods. No fear, no plans, just his instinct and his power of will. After an hour of clandestine and noiseless moving through the dark of the forest, he saw a pack of wolves preparing for the hunt. The leader seemed to notice him, approached a bit and, after a couple of seconds of intensive eye-to-eye contact turned around and left with the pack. Clearly with the same thought as Dushan, that the risk was too big for such a small reward. Young king needed something larger for this night. Something stronger and, if possible, with just one head. And a pack of wolves is always more dangerous than a single bear. He needed a fight, not a massacre. Now, he was standing at the edge of a clearing, looking at the largest bear he ever saw. Brown fur was shiny in the moonlight, almost sparkling whenever the mighty muscles moved under the skin. There it was. Standing on its hind legs, stretched to his height, just a bit taller than himself - it was waiting for him. That much was obvious since it was looking straight into his eyes, almost in a challenge. Dushan walked towards the bear, confident in his strength and might, and spoke
- I do not wish you harm, I do not intend to kill you. I just need to prove myself that my strength is with me and that I do not need to fear tomorrow’s battle. Help me or let me pass!
- When a king asks, all must answer. Your desire has alerted me and I’m waiting for you. Let us wrestle and decide. If I put your back to the ground your life is forfeit, If you turn my back to the ground I’ll grant you one wish.
Young king wondered, but speaking animal held no surprise, there are beings in this country that can change shape in accordance with their needs. Obviously, this wasn’t really a bear, just something that chose to look like one in order to test him.
- What are you and why do you wish to fight me?
- Should you win young king I’ll hold no secrets. But beware, much power is needed to defeat me, and much is at stake. I’m here to test your worth and to decide about your people. Do what is your most, for I shall not spare you.
After those words, the animal bent its neck and charged. There was only enough time for Dushan to spread his legs and welcome the attack with his arms wide open. Strangely, there was no smell of wild animal’s fur and rotting flesh on the claws. Rather, it felt as if he was wrestling a very large man in a thick coat. But the muscles were real and hard, the power was great and young king was pushed half way to his knees. He held for a second and then pushed his body upwards with all the strength of his legs. The bear faltered a bit and started to lose ground. Dushan pushed harder, pressing the bear’s chest with his arms, trying to crush the air out of it. Then again, the bear answered, shifting position slightly to bring him out of balance and make him loose the grip.
This went on for some time; the silence fell upon the forest as they wrestled on, neither gaining enough ground to overcome the other. Suddenly, Dushan felt a rock under his heel and pressed against it. At the same time, the bear pressed forward allowing the young king to use it as leverage. He turned his body a bit, the bear lost his balance and Dushan threw it on its back, pressing him with all of his body strength.
- Yield before me!
- I admit your strength, tonight the victory is yours. 
- Now answer my question, what are you?
- I am the dragon, young king, here to test your power.
With these words, the bear stood up and shook off its fur in one mighty movement. It seemed as if a coat was opened on the front side and the whole bearskin just flew back. Now, there was a man of exceptional beauty in front of Dushan, radiating power and light from within. His eyes seemed to be glowing and his skin, paler than it was with ordinary people, was stretched over bulky muscles, large enough to match the young king.
He looked around and the clearing in the woods began to fill up with animals. That pack of wolves he saw earlier was here, smaller animals such as rabbits and squirrels, even a couple of brown bears. All of them just stood there, making no advance but also allowing him no retreat.
- You promised something before, am I to trust or are these here to help you break the promise?
- Foolish child! One does not question a promise of a dragon! I was here long before humans and I’ll be here long after you’re gone.
A dragon! Now, after these words, Dushan shuttered. If he had known whom is he to fight there would be no victory for him. Dragons were creatures of the land, lords of the realm, mortals were better of avoiding any contact. Stories were told about the dragons helping leaders overcome the conquerors, giving the power to the kings and saving the people, but always at a cost, always with a price. Always, without exception, a price had to be paid. Dushan knew that his instinct brought him to the right place, he did receive the answer about his strength, but what is there to pay for it?
- Forgive me, master, for we are all in your mercy, kings and peasants alike. I had no knowledge who I was speaking to.
- At least, you do now. The decision had to be made; I’ve seen you in former battles, so young and so strong. Our land is in danger and your bloodline is the only thing standing guard. This is the turning point for us all. But, as you may or may not know, although powerful and all but omnipotent, I’m bound by the laws of the land and the laws of my rule. There is no way a dragon can bestow great might to an unworthy vessel. Or use it himself within the realm of humans. Matters of men are their own; I can only answer with equal power. Therefore, you had to prove yourself worthy of my assistance. And now, say your wish and it’ll be granted. 
- I saw your eyes glowing after the battle, and if it is my right to ask for anything than grant me this. I want that fire; I want to burn my enemies with nothing more than a look. I want to be the greatest.
- Are you sure? Mortals, even as strong as you are, can’t hold the dragon’s fire for long. It’ll consume you from inside; turn you into something other than what you are. Can’t I interest you in something more material?
- Your promise was for anything, this is my wish. Give me the fire or kill me.
- Very well young king, so shall it be. I grant you the fire and a free warning. Do not waste it, it comes from your soul and taxes your future. Use it to protect your land and yours alone.
With these words, the dragon placed his right palm to his mouth, breathed out and waved towards young king as if sending him a kiss. Dushan blinked, and in that blink, the dragon had disappeared. All the animals were moving away, opening a trail for him to follow – a trail that surely led to his military camp. Towards his soldiers and his father, towards the victory, he just needed to walk. At the end of the clearing, leader of the wolf pack approached him, lowered his head without taking the eyes of Dushan and just stood there. Dushan nodded. The wolf did the same and turned around to vanish into the woods. 
Later that night Dushan stood in front of his regiments. As they watched him in awe, he spoke for the first time to all of them at once. And they listened, but more than that, they felt his words fill them up with power. Strange power that flowed from his body and his words. Although they were Christian, it seemed to them as if Perun himself, God of thunder and lightning, stood before them and spoke.
- Tomorrow we march! Not to war because wars can be lost. We march to victory, to legend, to eternal life! Follow me and I promise each and every one of you that. And to our enemies, I promise this: Fear me; for I am not a man, I am a wolf. I do not talk and write, I howl! I do not howl because I’m afraid, I do not howl because I’m rabid! I howl to be heard by my Pack, to be heard by my wolves, by she-wolves, by my cubs, so my Pack can gather around me! And when my Pack gathers, be afraid you dogs!
And his Pack howled back. With the golden glow in their eyes just like he had in his own.


Chapter 10

Enter, child, and ask.
The Book of answers, footnotes

Between, where time has no power

As the gate opened, I jumped backward. Would’ve fallen for sure, but I instinctively spread my arms and the wings under them flapped and stretched, allowing me to hold my posture. For a moment it confused me, I always thought the wings were just for show, but now I saw and felt the power inside them. My arms were free to move since the wings kind of opened backward and up as if I suddenly had two more shoulder blades. 
A figure emerged from the gate. I blinked. It was brother Stefan, the monk from the monastery who was my guide to the old lady’s village. The fact that he looked just the same filled me with sheer dread – no one looked the same in Between as he did in the real world. That is, no one with any weakness. Save the faint golden glow of his skin, he was exactly like any other human. I had to ask.
- Brother Stefan?
- That is one of my names, one that I use when dwelling among people. Here I’m known otherwise. Here I serve another purpose and use another name.
Hm. More words than before. Curiouser and curiouser said Alice in the back of my head. 
- Who are you?
- Not who Peter, what. But I’ll answer anyway since it is my purpose. I am the Book of answers. A grimoire if you’d like. A book of knowledge bound in human skin and written in blood. I am, or at least used to be, an Angel. One who volunteered to act as a counterweight to the most dangerous artifact on Earth. Ask, child, and I’ll answer.
- Ask what? Ask anything?
- Anything within your grasp, anything that you can understand, anything I can teach you.
Anything I could learn. Tempting and strange. I knew time didn’t pass in this realm, but to sit here and listen would not stop my real life in real world. The legends and crumbs of knowledge I gathered told me that, upon reentering the real world I’d have to pay for the passing of time. It would catch up with me. So, this was the task of the mind. To know everything I’ve always wanted to know or to pass on and stay alive. Stefan was not a threat on his own, but the danger was just the same. The temptation was strong and for a moment I pondered upon staying here forever, learning all there was to learn, never going back. But then I remembered. There was a duty. There was a promise.
Besides, where was the fun in learning things the easy way?
-  How do I enter to visit the Lord of this realm? What must I do to enter a plea to him?
- Don’t you wish to know other things? Are there no mysteries more precious to your mind? Wouldn’t you like to hear more about yourself, since I know for sure that you don’t know all? Wouldn’t you like to sit down and listen to me answering all your queries?
- I know enough, just as I am. Please do not confuse me, there is something I must do.
- Indeed, there is, but more than you know. The thing that you are here to do is an easy task, but the thing that you must do to fulfill this one shall take most of your powers. Although you are unaware of your true potential. Are you certain?
- I am. Now please tell me how to pass the second task?
- You have just done so. By refusing my offer you have proven your determination and therefore earned the passage. In doing so, you refused personal gain, and I must say that it is not often I come across such answer.
Behind him the air shimmered, the gate disappeared, and I could see a vast field filled up with bodies in seated position. Well, mostly with skeletons in rags, some of which were only vaguely humanoid. I saw what would happen to me if I took his offer – I’d just sit there for eternity, listening to answers until more and more questions arose in my mind. Until my time in the real world was over and death would catch up with me even here. Cold sweat slid down my spine as I watched.
- Enter, child, the Lord awaits you.
I walked forward before I even decided to do so. He turned his back to me and went ahead, producing a kind of déjà vu feeling from our earlier meeting. My legs were moving on their own volition, dragging my body along, as the field of dead knowledge seekers faded away and the walls of a tunnel formed. The light was scarce, mainly coming from Stefan’s body. A question rose in my mind, but I dared not ask, afraid of falling into a trap.
- Your test is over, you can freely ask now. Of course, now I can only answer simple questions, my limits disappear only for the test itself.
- Why did you choose Stefan? I mean, why any name?
- Before time, before I volunteered for this task, I had no need to be named. Our Lord knew as all as we were created. When I took this task upon me, I had to choose one designation in order to be addressed by humans. My first protégée chose Stefan for me.
- I was just curious, our former rulers held Stefan as one of their names. It’s just an interesting coincidence…
- Not a coincidence, there are no such things. Your ancestors held this name to show that I’m their advisor and that they are protectors of the land.
- Protectors from what? The enemies?
- Well, not just the enemies, but from the force that was my counterpart. You’ll know all about it soon enough, the Dragon has a task for you.
One other thing started to nag me in the back of my mind. Something Stefan had said, but I couldn’t put my finger on it. Something about…
- Hey! What did you mean when you said “ancestors”? Nemanjic dynasty has been dead for a long time!
- Has it now?
My mouth dropped, but not a word came out. We entered a well-lit hall filled with people. Well, broadly speaking. There were more wings, claws, and hooves here than in a zoo, and some shades seemed to be alive. And there were a very large number of nude ladies and naked whatever. I’m not really gender determined, but some things here looked as pure horror rather than desirable. And in corners, some things were doing some other things that were impossible even to explain much less to comprehend. Hieronymus Bosch would’ve had a field day here – if he wasn’t here before.
When I stopped gawking around, my eyes flew in the direction of the center. It seemed that all present beings were just satellites of the enormous gravity field. There was a throne in the middle of the events, and on it was the most beautiful man I’ve ever seen. And at his feet was Morana. For a second, I was enthralled, but then a scene from a movie came to mind and I was free to walk again.
- Come to me Peter. I’ve been promised that you’ll come.
No more than a whisper. Actually, there was no evidence that he even spoke, but all the things and all the beings fell silent and I could hear the words as clear as if I was just there in front of him.
- Come to me, there is much to be told and much to be understood. Come to me.
I came. 


Chapter 11

Uphold the Sylvan, for they are from God. If they disappear, the wolves won’t recognize you as brothers.
The Book of answers, vol. 14, chapter 55

1355,  District of Devoll, Serbian Empire

Great dogs stood up as one in the yard. All of them looking upwards; staring at the window of the room where the Emperor was on his deathbed. Silent as they always were, waiting ominously, their tails immobile. It seemed to young guard as if they were cast in bronze.
Dragon dogs, as they were known, were the battle dogs of the nobles. Having no fear of any living creature, they were brave and relentless, entering each battle without a sound and ending it only when either the enemy or the dog was dead. Each of them showing a white mark on the forehead, where the Emperor touched the first of the race. Enemies called them demon dogs, running away at the mere sight of them. They held no master but the one they chose to protect. It was popular belief that these dogs were given to Serbs by God himself to serve as mediators between people and wolves – so the brothers wouldn’t kill each other since wolves and Serbs had the same ancestors. Of course, this wasn’t true, but it seemed very probable considering the deep understanding of the race towards their human companion and the ferocious appearance of the tall beast.
Now, all of them were waiting. Without any exception, without any divergence between them. All the nobles entered the yard to watch the dogs. Suddenly, following some silent command, all of them started humming a deep resonant tone. Not the howl, not the bark, just this deep, deep tone that went into vibration people couldn’t hear but only feel. A resonance that made them shudders in sudden fear. And then, as if another command was issued, all of the dogs fell silent to the ground.
- The Emperor is dead!
- Shut up you fool! The Emperor can’t die, we are about to embark on a holy crusade!
- The dragons can’t lie, they know! Oh God, what’s gonna be with us now?
- Guards! Take this coward to be quartered for defeatism!
- Sir! He’s right! The Emperor just died of the poison. I came to make sure you hear the bad news immediately but it seems that dragons are above the common messenger…
Thus ends the greatest of the warriors. Not in a battle, for there was no hero that could defeat him, but in his bed, murdered by a weapon of cowardice. Up, in his room, assembled noblemen could see the light gathering above his body and flying through the north window. And they could feel the cold rising in their souls as the flame left.

Have no fear; fear is not for you but for your enemies. Stand in awe in front of the Elder, never in fear.

Between, where time has no power

Even it seemed far at the first glance, it felt as if there were only a few steps needed to get in front of the Dragon. He stood up and I knew it was him as soon as I looked. I am quite high, not only in this realm, but his head was above mine. Morana was sitting in front of his feet, silent and small as she was. Her clothes were different but still remained mainly black as before. Tough it seemed there was more fur on her body than I felt like comfortable. Not HER fur mind you, she was dressed in it.
- Welcome, my boy. You are welcome here although you are part of both realms. I owe it to your mother to bid you welcome to my domain.
- You know my mother? I thought it wasn’t common knowledge…
- How can I be ignorant towards anything in my domain? Forest mother is formally one of my minions, but in truth, she and I are almost equal. Save for the parts of the land where there is no greenery. It seems that she loathes the stone. Please, sit on my throne and help yourself with food and wine as we speak about your task.
I felt compelled, to say something, but my body followed his words as if it wasn’t mine. Before I knew, there were a piece of roast and a pitcher of wine in my hands and I was watching the show in front of me with high interest as if there was nothing else in the wide world.
The dragon smiled. The hair on the back of my head tried to climb up. His mouth was smiling, but his eyes just glowed gold and his face didn’t change expression. Suddenly, the roast in my hand seemed colder and the wine looked kinda sour.
- Now, my boy, as it is customary, I have to ask you. Why did you enter? Is it just to pay homage to an ancient being? Is it to bring me news from what your kind thinks as the real world? Or is it to ask me for some assistance? If so, then I’m obliged to tell you that I no longer help humans. I’ve been betrayed too many times to count, you tend to forget your obligations after just a couple of generations…
He waved towards me and I was able to speak again. Of course, this was the polite part of our conversation. The part where I was to feel as if there can be any demand on my behalf. After all, how often are you standing in front of a god asking for something? My wishes could be granted or not, but there was no doubt that the price shall be paid in any case. 
- My Lord, you probably already know why I’m here. It is unlikely that anything can be held secret in your domain. But, since you asked, I must say that I’m here to take this girl back to my own world. If it pleases you, I’ll offer a service in payment for her.
- Right you are, and well taught. It seems that you have been listening to your mother even if you do ignore her a lot. You know who this girl is, but are you aware of WHAT she is?
- I am aware; your daughter has told me. Nevertheless, I must ask you again to release her. It is not in my nature to decline a task when I’m invited to help, and it is my obligation to fulfill it.
- Ah, my daughter. She played with that mortal for a long while; the oaks that grow in front of her house were just acorns when they met. I allowed it because there is only so much fun here and it really couldn’t make any difference ‘cause there could be no offspring between a dragon and a mortal. But she went too far with this one. The old man is now nothing more than a shadow, mere soul with a form, and soon to join other shades. This one has too much knowledge and too much power inside her. My rebellious daughter fed her with her own milk as a baby. I can feel it burning inside her.
Wow. A new moment emerged in the story. I could hear the old woman laughing in my head. She did tell me about the Old Lore and the magic she taught Morana but withheld a very important piece of need-to-know information. She gave her fire, making her more than human, albeit less than an immortal.
- Had I’ve known that fact I would probably give it some more taught.
- And refused the request?
- Nah, I’m too stubborn for that.
This time, he really laughed. I could feel it, probably since all the faces looked up at him and stopped all activities. There it goes, my big mouth has finally closed around my neck.
-You bring me joy young one, it has been a few centuries since I last laughed. For this, I’ll grant you safe passage out of my halls. You can freely walk out this moment and not a soul may touch you.
- Thank you my Lord, but I must insist. Give me Morana, let her come with me.
As much the previous joy, so his current rage could be felt around the room. My bones started reverberating in it.
- Insolent boy! Do you not know what it means to defy me?
- I do, my Lord. It is not my intention to insult and it is not my place to enforce the Old Lore, but I’ve asked thrice and I wish for an answer. What must I do to get her?
- Very well. Since you call upon the ancient customs then I’ll oblige. Three things you must do and three things you can get from me. And thrice I’ll give you assistance. Choose well what you wish and then you’ll hear your tasks.
This was it. He accepted my plea and there was a fighting chance. Maybe I can still get out of here alive and unscathed. I couldn’t guess what he’ll ask of me to perform, but if I could get the three items correctly there might even be some relief to it. Fortunately, some things I’ve learned as a child were fresh in my mind.
- I need a safe passage for us both and your promise not to pursue us. I also need the knowledge of the solutions to the tasks ahead, and a weapon to defend myself on those missions. Those are my three demands. State your tasks.
- Well chosen, for much will depend on a weapon and on the knowledge. The first task is to bring my defiant daughter to me. It has been long since we saw each other and my heart longs for her presence. The second task is to bind you to this girl so she could not misuse her powers, and the third one needs some time to be explained. It is going to be the hardest of all but you seem to be the one I’ve been waiting to perform it.
There, nothing to it. And I taught it is going to be hard. I could never bring his daughter to him without her consent. Much less was it possible to bind Morana to me in any way imaginable. Cool. There is no need for me to hear the third task for I’m dead on the first two.
The air at my side shimmered and produced a young maiden of great beauty. Her dress was made of golden feathers and she held a thin crown, no more than a ring on her forehead. Vaguely, she looked familiar, but I was sure that I’ve never seen her before. You can imagine my surprise when she spoke.
- Here I am, father. The first task completed. My human has passed on and I’m back with you.
Right on. Three cheers for me. One impossible task down, two more miracles to go. Something told me that I’m being played here.
- Welcome, my child. It seems that this Halfling might still be the one.
- He is, father, I could feel it in him and Forest mother said that he is her most powerful child.
- Well, that takes us to the second task. Do you accept it?
I rather wouldn’t, but there was nothing else for me to say than I do. He smiled again with that cold smile and pointed to Morana.
- Thank you for accepting. That was enough for the task to be completed. I know that humans can’t be bound as we can, so I’ll help you do that. With this, I give you the weapon to defeat your enemies.
He pointed a finger towards Morana and golden light flowed from it into her body. Nothing seemed to happen, but she suddenly stood up and looked at me with fire in her eyes.
- I oblige, my Lord. – She said – Your wish is my command. He’ll be protected.
Yeah, like this tiny maiden could protect me from anything. She was like one-quarter of my bulk and it looked as if I could eat her whole in just one meal. What could she possibly protect me from? And then I remembered what she was, and what that golden streak meant. Again, I felt cold sweat sliding down my spine. A dragon by proxy, this was now only her Between body. God knows what she’ll look like when we get out.
- And now let us speak about the third task. About the task, you were born for. The task your mother promised you’ll do.
There it was. All of this was just a game to make me obligated into something larger. Something I would otherwise turn down flat. Thank you mother, we’ll speak about it as soon as I get out of here. And there’ll be hell to pay, I promise.


Chapter 13

Blood must be kept, for it is the only cup that holds the fire. There is no chalice, forged or cast, which can keep the power the same way the flesh does.
The Book of answers, vol. 15, chapter 26

1426,  Manasija monastery, forest around the buildings

Despot Stefan stood in front of mighty oaks surrounding his legacy, Manasija monastery. Almost fifty years old, ruling this country since he was twelve. And it was not an easy rule – most of his life were spent in constant battles and endless wars. He was tired and ready to rest. The only thing that bothered him was the inability to produce an heir. Not for the lack of trying, it was simply not meant to be. His wife Jelena seemed to be unable to hold his seed. Unable or unwilling, made no difference. His only hope was now in his cousin Djuradj, his sister’s son; although his was technically senior to him, they were of the same age, and it was just appropriate to leave the land to him. Especially since that would end the feud between Stefan and his uncle, Djuradj’s father Vuk.
Now, he was standing there, watching the trees as if there could be found an answer to his troubles. A glimpse of white caught his eye, he looked closer and it seemed to him there was a white doe between the bushes. Stefan grabbed his sword and walked stealthily into the gloom. As he moved, the doe seemed to emerge every once in a while, keeping him on track but never getting close enough. Suddenly, he realized that he was lost. Well, not completely, he could never be completely lost in these woods. But, there it was, he couldn’t tell exactly where he was in this forest. The trees seemed older than any he ever saw, and the moss was as thick as any mattress in his court. With nothing better to do, he sat down against a very large tree trunk and drifted into his thoughts. A poet, a writer, a sad soul caught in a high position. He would rather become a simple servant than a despot, but what was born by a cat must catch mice. Such was the fate of princes – to become leaders, rule the land and protect his people. His own sister got much worse faith, having to marry Turkish sultan just to preserve the independence of their country. After Bayezid died, she came back, but it was nevertheless great sacrifice. Ah, heavy was his burden…
- What might be troubling our king in this wonderful forest?
Stefan jumped to the voice. In front of him was a woman, heavenly beautiful, with pale white skin and sparkling green eyes. Her raven hair was waist long and very thick, encircling her full bosom and strong hips. And she was stark naked. That’s how Stefan noticed the bosom.
- What happened to you, my lady? Were you attacked and robbed by someone?
- Oh, my king, but who would be so bold to attack me in this country? With a dragon knight to defend and rule almost all of us? – She said with a smirk on her lips.
- But I can’t help noticing you have no clothes. Surely this is not your custom?
- Indeed, it is, for I am the Forest mother, or, at least, you could know me by that name.
- Indeed, I do, and I’m humble before you. What might be your bidding?
- Oh, a polite king, that’s new! – She exclaimed laughingly – There is one tiny little thing you might do to me if you dare and are willing.
- What might that be?
She came closer to him, walking slowly, as the trees around them lowered their branches into a dome of bark and leaves. Still, it was not dark or gloomy, it seemed to him that the moss started to glow pale yellow light.
- Once upon a time, when your father was just an infant, a mighty Dragon lord fought a battle with a young king in one of my forests. He had promised one wish to the king if the latter wins and kept to his word. The young king asked for Dragons fire, and he received it. That made him the strongest man alive, a Tsar, but also turned him away from his true faith. He started to believe that not even death can touch him. When he died, the fire returned to the Dragon, but the sparks remained in his blood. They remained in his descendants. You, my king, are the last one with strong enough power. After you, there will be kings, but none of them shall hold that fire.
- Silly woman! I surely can’t be the last, I’m still young and there is still time! If Jelena won’t give me children, some other will!
- Oh, my poor child, but your time is at an end. No child is meant for you. I am the Forest mother, I can say.
Stefan knew that must be the truth, she was the helper of pregnant women and none else was more knowledgeable in that matter. Suddenly, he felt weak and needed to sit.
- So, this is where we die, this is where we end. I hoped for a glorious rule of my descendants, and now you tell me there shall be none…
- No, my king. There shall be one. That’s the favor I came to ask. Nay, I came to ask or take. It is up to you if it will be pleasure or pain.
With those words her skin turned to bark, similar to the trees around them, her hair turned white and her nails elongated into curved blades. It seemed as if her teeth were all fangs at the same time. - What say you?
- What can I say? Since there is no real choice, I willingly grant what you wish. What is it that you need?
- I need your seed, my king; I need to preserve the power. This I promise to you: one day your son shall rule again, one day your line shall continue.
Her body turned to beauty once more. Stefan felt his armor falling off him as his clothes were removed. And then there was just the sweet odor of forest flowers and gentle caressing of the willing body. She made love to him as if it was his first time as if he never felt the softness of a woman. And he was truly willing to oblige.


Chapter 14

Fire and stone; steel and flesh. Power is the same but the wielder is not. Stand fast and steady, and state your demands. Even the steel fears the fire.
The Book of answers, vol. 21, chapter 12

2012, somewhere near Mt. Rtanj

We found ourselves in the forest near the cave, in the real world, the realm of the humans. Can’t say I wasn’t happy about it, it never felt comfortable being Between, not for the lack of abilities but for the psychic feel of it. I could never be accustomed to my other self, it was all wrong in most simple ways.
Morana was sound asleep near me, just as she was in the residence of the Dragon. He said she will be since the story was meant only for my ears. And it was some story, I tell you. My spine felt melted as I was listening to the scheme calculated and plotted centuries ago. Humans received an ultimate gift of freedom to choose between good and evil, and it was good. What wasn’t good is the fact that our freedom produced power. The power that went to the side that gained the most support – evil or good, it was our choice. All that supernatural beings were able to do was to subtly manipulate single humans to the direction of their choosing. For them, there was no gain, but they couldn’t resist a good game. The Dragon and my mother decided to support good, but there were other forces acting as their counterpart. Well, even the concept of good and evil was lost to them, but generally, they supported the side of life, the side of nature. They didn’t care much about people, but they cared about the animals and plants we could destroy in our fights.
And now I was in the forest, with Morana at my side, no longer a protégée but rather a protective force and additional power. The Dragon gave her might, a strange one. What was worse, I learned that both of us were planned to be what we are. Even our meeting was manipulated. And now she lay at my feet, small and fragile as ever, but I could feel the strength deep inside, under the skin and bones. The power inside her was beyond any normal human. Good thing was that she couldn’t use it at will, it was only meant to be awakened in the time of peril, to protect us both. I had no idea what it could manifest. Funny, in this union I was to be the damsel in distress and she was to be a mighty dragon. And I was not a weakling. Strangely, there was no difference in her appearance. I thought there should be at least some hint of the power residing in her.
She opened her eyes and stood up shakily.
- Peter? Where are we?
- In the forest, just under the mountain. Do you remember what happened?
- No, I just remember the crash and now we are here. What do we do?
- Now we go to do our duty, as it was tasked upon us.
- Immediately?
- No. Not immediately. First I must summon someone and she will not be happy about it.
Of course, she won’t. My mother was a free spirit and didn’t like to be summoned like a servant demon. She was the Mistress of the forest and the fact of my being her son didn’t mean that she’ll spare my life if my insolence angers her. As angry as I was for this manipulation, there was no death wish in my mind.
- How do we do it?
- I have some knowledge and some tools, but it won’t be easy or safe. Don’t get caught if it gets ugly.
- I’ll try, but no promise.
We walked deeper into the forest. I had to find just the right spot that can please my mother when she appears. Technically, I could summon her anywhere, but she would probably just turn me into a tree for a couple of centuries. It was hard to make her happy.
- What are we looking for? – Morana asked.
- Well, it would be the best if we could find a waterfall surrounded by forest flowers and a pond, perhaps even something never visited by other people, but I’ll satisfy with a spring under some old trees.
- And why is that so important?
- I need to speak to my mother. Mummy dearest needs to answer a few questions.
Suddenly, there it was. A perfect spot surrounded by large tree trunks and thick moss on the ground. Sunlight was piercing through the leaves turning emerald instead of yellow, and little pink flowers were growing all around. The scent of them was heavy in my nostrils. It wasn’t really hard to summon a demon. You just had to know what do you want to them and be prepared to offer something of interest. If not, they could decide that it would be very interesting to watch you run with your skin tied around your ankles. I pulled out my tools from the backpack. Four fire irons, some mushrooms and a piece of flint. For this occasion, I chose the greenish one; it was mom’s favorite color.
- What are those?
- These? Fire irons. You take it in your fist and scratch over the flint to produce the spark. The spark lights up the mushroom, and then you can add some wood to the fire.
- They look like letters S on the national crest…
- Well, that’s because those are not letters. They only look like Cyrillic S, but in fact, those are fire irons. Like these, only plain. These were forged long ago, by an iron master like no other. With these, you don’t need fuel, but the fire lighted shines like a beacon all around another world. It is quite dangerous to use them if you don’t have a very good reason.
- But, why do you need four of them? You have just two hands, and one is needed to hold the flint.
- You need only one to light an ordinary fire, magic requires, at least, two, summoning all four. You see, a single iron produces enough sparks to light a fire, but the fire we need for this takes a lot more sparks. Hence more irons. Either more irons or you should scratch the flint so fast that your arm would break off.
- OK, what do you need me to do?
- Take this candle, and when I light the mushroom use the fire to light it. After that, just stand behind, preferably with a tree behind you. It could get ugly if she is in a bad mood…
I placed one of the irons on my open palm, then another over it, taking care they are aligned, then another and a fourth. I closed my fist with care so the alignment wouldn’t be disturbed, picked up the flint and slowly scratched on it. Nothing happened. I tried again, and again, and more nothing happened. There were no sparks at all.
- My darling, you don’t need special invitations when you visit your mother’s house. – the voice was calm, but there were razors in it.
I jumped up, feeling the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Turned slowly, and saw her standing right between me and Morana; so that I couldn’t see the girl at all.
- Hello, my son, it’s been a while since you came to visit. I almost thought that you were avoiding me…
- Hello, mother. If you recall, there was a small problem the last time we met…
- Ah, that lumberjack killed my favorite juniper! I would’ve forgiven him if he did it to make something useful of it, but he just did it because the tree was in his way!
- But his wife called ME for help! I was so ashamed when nothing worked! Their marriage broke up because he blamed her for all the stillborn children, and I knew it was your doing!
- Nah, it was easy, but you failed to ask the right question. What did you think? You just do the rituals and old mom shall obey? If you’ve just listened, I’d tell you to order the man to make a baby cradle of that juniper tree and the children would live.
- And what about that gantlet of thorns you gave me while I was leaving them?
- Any good mother must discipline her child. That makes them better people.
Yeah, right. I still had scars on my back and my tights. Some of those thorns were half a meter long and they were beating with all their power. My military grade jacket was torn to bits like spider cob. Just then Morana decided to speak.
- Peter, who is this woman?
- Ah, the changeling speaks! I must say you look interesting enough to eat! But there is not enough meat on you. We must change that fact in due time
O-o, not a good sign. I couldn’t quite decide if she is making a joke or not, but she could just as easy eat Morana as any small animal.
- My lady, I was told that you are Peter’s mother. I’m just an innocent bystander here but I’ll accept your will as my own.
- Hah! The Dragons daughter thought you well! No, my child, your life was spared for a greater purpose. I see the fire in you, I see the power, but there is also a lock. You were brought here by my naïve son so I could do my part in your destiny. Please, accept a gift from me as a token of my goodwill.
I would’ve screamed, but dared not. NEVER, and I mean NEVER accept unpaid gifts from demons or fairies! Anything they give you comes with a price. As I stood there, petrified and afraid, my mother gave Morana a feather. A very small, white feather. She took it gingerly and at that moment there was that golden glow in her eyes again. I heard a tiny grate in the woods around us and looked to the side. There were several young maidens in long white robes just like my mother was wearing. They all had wreaths made of leaves on their heads, and all were heavenly beautiful. Fairies. Forest ones. Oh god, this was not good for me.
- Don’t worry Peter, they are not here for you – she said with a smirk on her face – you are not the object of their attention today. And after tomorrow, you shall never be, I promise.
- Mother dear, I know there is no protection from them, this is not my first dance with them.
- Not for an ordinary human, no. But tomorrow you will no longer be one. And there will be someone else with you, forever.
- No longer ordinary or no longer human? Because I’m not ordinary even now…
- I’ll tell you all later, now we must attend this little girl.
She turned to Morana and spoke.
- My child, this is the first feather of your wings. I give you the power of fairy; your great grandfather gave you the dragon’s fire, and you shall be the first and the last such creature. Your only role is to protect and serve and to do so with my son. Please, go with these girls and return to us when all is done, I must speak with Peter.
- I will Mother. What must I do?
- Just dance, nothing more and nothing less.
She turned to me as Morana slowly walked away with the rest of fairies. I feared a bit about her but my mother said there shall be no harm to her. A promise is a binding force with demons and fairies and it was good enough for me.
- And now, child, we must talk. There are things you must know now, for much is at stake. Time grew shorter during the years you’ve spent in the Dragon’s cave.
Years? What years? We were there for one night only.


Chapter 15

Never trust brothers if they don’t share the same faith. Their allegiance lies in their blood and in nothing else.
The Book of answers, vol. 15, chapter 57

1457,  Manasija monastery, forest around the buildings

Despot Lazar pondered upon the words of his advisor Mihailo Angelovic. Ever since the death of his father Djuradj and his rising to the throne of Serbia things were tough for him. In just two years of his rule, the Turks were pressing hard from the south and the Hungarians from the north. Serbia was once again between the hammer and the anvil and, this time, there were no mighty knights of the Order of Red Dragon to defend it. Only he was there, the third son of a late despot, the only one not blinded by mighty sultan Murad. His only help came from Mihailo, the descendant of the Byzantine emperors, and his brother Mahmud, the Grand Vizier of Ottoman empire. Mahmud was taken by the Turks as a child in blood tax and rose through the ranks to the position of Grand Vizier. Together, two of them arranged the fate of little Serbia, now smaller than ever.
It was obvious to Lazar that he had practically no part in this arrangement. Mihailo and Mahmud yearned for the former glory of their Angelus family; their forefathers were the emperors of a great empire. And Lazar was just a weak successor of once great Nemanjic dynasty. He had no children, as it seemed to be the faith of all recent Serbian leaders, and after his death, there was only his blind brother Stefan. And nobody shall follow the blind king, not unless he was a holy one. Oh, how he wished for the power of Dushan or the wisdom of his namesake Lazar. Nothing to it.
- Noble sir, it is time. My brother is ready to accept the terms and he has the charter granting our country independence. If it pleases you, he is waiting in the throne room.
- It pleases me not, but a sovereign is merely a servant to his people. Go tell him I’m coming.
He was to give the oath of obedience to the Ottoman empire in exchange for peace. Perhaps this will grant his people some rest. As he walked in the room he could not help but notice the Grand Vizier and his brother talking quietly in the corner. They were far too friendly for the representatives of the opposing nations.
- Ah, young despot. Our holly sultan sends his regards to his vassal. Will you become the part of the great Ottoman empire and uphold the rule of our sultan?
- I will because I must. With heavy burden, I accept my shame in exchange for the freedom of my people. 
And he signed the papers. Not a year shall pass; he will be dead and Serbia just one of the Turkish provinces for many centuries to come. But, for him, this was the best he could do.


Chapter 16

Power is an obligation. The way you use it chooses to whom you become beholden. Choose well, or refuse.
The Book of answers, vol. 21, chapter 12

2012, somewhere near Mt. Rtanj

As Morana walked away, my mother sat down and I did the same. The moss was warm and soft, and I felt again like I did in my early childhood before she gave me to the people she chose to raise me. As I recalled, they were great and loving people and they cared for me with great attention. She said to me that I needed to learn the ways of my kin, and visited me from time to time. Those visits were always like vacations since she used to lead me back to the woods and introduce me to different magical people of her realm. My true teachers in the art of magic. When I grew up, I left that foster home for studies and never came back. The couple that raised me died mysteriously after few months of my departure.
- What do you with to know first?
- How come I couldn’t light the fire with my irons? I was told those were the fire irons made by the Light master of Alexandria, they were supposed to light the fire in all circumstances.
- Well, in my forest there are my rules, but this time, it wasn’t any of my doing. Did you see what the Dragon lord did to your companion?
- You mean Morana? He poured some light into her body and said she’ll be my protector.
- Yes. She is meant to be your protector and more than just that. The light he poured into her was his fire. The same fire he gave to one of the kings of your homeland. The one that later on became the emperor. That same fire flows in your blood, a genetic trait in your bloodline. Because of that fire, there was no need for the spark, I saw you from far and came by my free will. It’ll work fine for lesser creatures when you use it again.
- The emperor? But there was only one! You mean I’m a descendant of the Nemanjic line? I can’t be, they were extinct half a millennium ago…
- They were as the human measure time. One of them, the last with the strong power, was your father. He gave me his seed and his power in one of my forests, a place not much different than this one.
- But, how could it be? That would make me five centuries old and I don’t seem to remember so many years!
- Of course not, you silly child! Most of the time I carried you we were in Between. Time has no meaning there, my pregnancy only lasted nine months like with any woman, but it took five hundred years of occasional visits to this realm for me to give birth. If there was no need for my interventions you wouldn’t yet be born. Well, one could argue that since your birth was predicted in times of need. You see, at that time it was paramount to preserve the bloodline, one that promised to keep the secret of the artifact hidden here. Otherwise, the force within would break the seal and rule the Earth. No mortal woman could do so; therefore, I had to be included. Granted, it was a pleasure to spend time with that ruler, and it was interesting to become a mother. Even you were a bit of a nuisance to the wolves and deer. And I believe the rabbits shall never forgive you.
- What artifact?
- The one Dragon told you about. The one you must relocate to another country for safe keeping. What do you know?
- He told me that something was given to us by the Byzantine patriarch at the end of the empire. Something that gave power to our nation as long we kept it safe. There were some rules about it, like keeping constant prayers above it so the thing inside would stay asleep and keep the faith in people to stay powerful. He also mentioned something about me having to take it away before the enemies learn about its true location and to carry it to its original location. The very place where this artifact was given to the humans by God himself, to be kept safe and closed.
- Do you know what it is?
- No, I asked three times, but he said that the rule of three doesn’t apply to that question and that I shouldn’t insist. He only told me where it is.
- Good. Anybody who knows that answer must remain Between or the enemy shall learn about its whereabouts. One person can’t be told both the location and the knowledge of the secret. That information was given only to the first Patriarch of Serbia while the evil was busy destroying and ransacking Constantinople in search of it. By the time they learned the truth, it was already impossible for them to reach the artifact.
Something went through my mind at that point. I had to ask.
- Hey, you said something about the years we’ve spent in the Dragon’s cave. What did you mean?
- What year do you think it is?
- Same as it was a day ago, 2003, of course!
- Hah! You were there for nine years of human world! Time grows shorter; your task must be completed before the winter solstice. The force that wants the artifact to be released has finally reached the ruling position in this country. And, this you must know, when a ruler wishes it, the country obeys. That is the Old Lore. If the king stands with evil, the artifact shall be awakened and true evil released. The time has come for the artifact to leave Serbia. You can no longer hold it.
- What shall become of us?
- The wrath of the evil ones shall be great, but it shall pass. For once, you shall become uninteresting again and be allowed to exist freely. You should sleep now, the night is coming and Morana won’t be back before sunrise. She has some dancing to do tonight.
- What do you mean by that? What did you give her?
- I gave her nothing that wasn’t meant for her - just made her a fairy. Her grandmother adopted a mere human baby, but she fed her own milk to that child. Thus, she made her semi-immortal. The Dragon gave her fire, and my task was to give her the ability to both hold that power and to be able to use it. Otherwise, she would burn from within and remain just an empty shell of a woman. You might say I made her more than human.
- You turned her into a demon! 
- Now, now, no need for such classification. Angels and demons are of the same build, the title depends on a mortal that chooses. For the women that can’t have children I’m a demon, for those I helped to motherhood I’m a blessing, for you, I’m just a mother. You yourself are half demonic in nature. You saw what you look like in Between, not to mention that a mere mortal could never enter in there alive. 
- I know what I am, and so do all the people that call to my aid, but I’ve never seen myself as a demon. Half or whole, never!
- Nevertheless, you are what you are. Now you, at least, know the whole story of your origins. Don’t refuse it; you’ll need every bit of strength to perform the task upon you. After that, your reward shall be the choice.
- What choice?
- To stay what you are or to renounce it. Choose to be one of us or to be one of them. In either case, this is a farewell, not a goodbye. Sleep now, morning awaits you.
And so I slept. I slept certain that nothing will bother me in my rest.

1555,  Constantinople, court of Suleiman the Magnificent

Sokollu Mehmed Pasha has been summoned in front of the Sultan. It wasn’t the first time, and he hoped it won’t be the last. Ever since the great Turkish Empire took him from his home in Bosnia as part of the blood tax he only rose to positions. His loyalty was undoubted and proven over and over in many battles. Suleiman had only words of praise for him, but being elevated in such a vast Empire meant that one only made more enemies than friends. His fear was that one of these audiences is going to be for him to be turned to the executioner for silk string strangling. But, for now, he just hoped the best.
Sultan sat on his cushions, surrounded by many guards and several of his eunuchs. He just waved a hand towards Mehmed, inviting him to step closer.
- Mehmed Pasha, my most trusted general, do you know why I have summoned you?
- No, my sultan, but I’m ready at your command as ever. My life belongs to you.
- Come now, I have no need for your life. You are far more valuable to me alive. I need a piece of advice from you. Something that bothers me a lot.
- Say a word, all enemies shall piss their blood for their insolence!
- Not an enemy as such. There is a nation I need to calm down, a nation of fierce warriors. No amount of force ever succeeded to put them at peace, and I’m out of options. I need them for their battle strength that is unrivaled in all of my people, but they refuse to serve me as they could.
- And what advice do you need from me? I’m just a military man, force is all I know. Which nation is it?
- You are well educated in diplomacy, I see. This time, you do have an insight such as none of my advisors. I’ll put you to the rank of Third Vizier if you help me with this matter. It is your nation, my dear Mehmed. Serbs.
- My nation by birth, yes, I know us well. Ever since we took over they opposed us in every way possible. The answer is easy my sultan, Serbs remember their greatness of former centuries and they long for it even now. They can never be ruled as subjects, only by trickery.
- So, what are we to do?
- Before their royal coronation monastery Zica was burned down by Cumans they moved all of their treasures and their Patriarchate to Pec. Since the Turks arrived, this Patriarchate has been vacant; they moved the seat back to Zica…
- I know all this, but what do infidel monks have with the people?
- Everything. They are the mortar of their insolence.
- So, you propose me to kill them all and abolish their faith?
- Never! That would only enrage them. I propose this: Zica is too far in their territory, Pec is a lot closer. Rebuild their Patriarchate, bring them back, and then populate the land around with faithful Muslims. I’d recommend Arnaouts and Albanians, thus preventing both nations from rebellion and giving them the notion of your great mercy. But, be sure to give the Serbs something more, money or estates. There is no better was to conquer the, then by giving them the feel of power.
- And how would you control them? How can I know that they’ll stop dreaming of my death?
- My sultan, they will never stop dreaming of their Empire. But they’ll be grateful and quiet. My own brother is a monk of their faith. You can place him on the seat and give them back the right to their own religion under Ottoman rule.
- Very well, so be it. Restore their monastery and call upon your brother. And choose a place in Constantinople to live. My Third Vizier must be close to me.
Sokollu Mehmed Pasha smiled without changing his stern face. With one move he succeeded to rise once again in the ranks and to bring his own people to the rise. Although he served the Turks well, he could never forget his roots. It may take long, but Serbia will be great again. Praise to Lord, whatever His name was.

2012, a room, a bed, a fire

When I woke up I was in bed. It was a proper bed, with clean linen, pillow, and all shebang. Oddly, since I distinctly remember falling asleep in the woods, with my mother at my side, while waiting for Morana to return. She went with fairies on some mysterious dance that was supposed to be in my favor. What little I remembered from mothers lessons it meant that Morana is to become a fairy herself. In their world, one could be born as part of that company or become one when given the wings and danced with the others, kind of an initiation. How could that apply to Morana I had no knowledge, she was already so packed up with the mojo that more simply couldn’t fit in.
Slowly, I stood up, touching the floorboards with my bare feet. It was cold. I looked down my body and noticed that cold must’ve come from the fact that I was stark naked. That was not much of a surprise, what surprised me was the state of my body - clean as freshly showered. My hand touched my cheeks and I felt that even my face was cleanly shaven. Frankly, this was a bit embarrassing. I felt strangely violated. Not because somebody saw me naked, but because I was unaware of the process.
The door creaked and I swiftly covered as much of myself as I could. It was Morana, carrying a tray with something that smelled wonderful.
- Morning, I heard you move and assumed you’re awake.
- I did and I am – I said still fiddling with the sheet – Who put me to bed?
- I did. When I came back you were sound asleep and I had to move you here. When we arrived, there was nothing to do but wait so I took the time to spruce you up a bit. I hope you don’t mind?
Not really, she was harmless in her own way. She seemed more embarrassed than I was, judging by the sound of her voice. I looked up to her and my mind twisted. There was so much more of her than before. And in very interesting places, I must say. Skinny little girl with flat raven hair now had a full bosom and her hair was long and almost alive, creating a halo around her head. I felt a blush coming up my cheeks. And something else was up too. Shit, this sheet was too thin.
- O, I see you approve of my new look – she put the tray down and whirled around herself – Do you find me attractive now?
- To say the least. What happened?
- The mother said it was an imperative. People tend to notice a pretty woman and that can be a welcome distraction in battle. Of course, she said something more about it, but I’m not going to speak about it.
- Why not?
- Because I’ll show it.
She touched her shoulders and her dress simply coiled around her feet leaving her as naked as I was. I tried to speak but there was no voice coming out of my mouth. Her tiny feet seemed to flow across the floor and in a moment she was in front of me. Her scent was exhilarating and remained me of flowers.
- No need to speak now. I’ll tell you everything later. Just relax and enjoy.
With these words, her arms fell on my shoulders as she removed my sheet of armor from me. One by one, her knees came to the opposite sides of my body and I could feel her warmth pressing against my stomach. She slowly slid down my body, touching my most sensitive part with the secret between her thighs. My arms woke up as I caressed her breasts, feeling the nipples as hard as bullets brush against my fingers and press onto my chest. For a moment, I thought about how this could be improper and how I knew almost nothing about her, but at that very thought, I was already inside her. We remained still, but I could feel her inner muscles tightening and relaxing, I could feel her breath on my neck and I could see the light in the room expanding and brightening as if we were creating it with our bodies. There was nothing more for me to do but to completely stop thinking and surrender myself to her. I had my fair share of encounters with members of opposite sex, but this was something I never thought possible. I melted in her arms just like a piece of butter on a hot pan.
After what felt like days, as we lay entwined on the bed, I tried to recall what happened. I tried to remember the motions, the feelings, but even if she was still in my arms there was nothing in my mind. Nothing remained but contentment and joy. Boy, if this is what love feels like then I sure hope Morana will stay with me, I don’t think there could be anybody else like this in my future.
- Of course not, you silly man. That’s why I had to do it by surprise.
- How can… Can you hear my thoughts?
- Of course, I’m a fairy now. And we belong to each other. Your thoughts are mine as well as your body. Your mother told this to me, it was of utmost importance.
- I wouldn’t like to sound ungrateful, but why was it important that we unite like this? 
- Well, for you, it’s not as important as much as it is for me. I’m to be your protector, remember? And I can’t protect what isn’t mine. That’s the Lore. On the other hand, you needed me to be yours in order to accomplish the task ahead. Otherwise, there was a chance that you’ll become distracted by some things that can influence humans in such ways.
- Heh, like I wouldn’t recognize enthrallment! Do me a little credit!
- You wouldn’t – she said seriously as she lifted her head to look me straight in the eyes – things that can appeal to your most animal instincts are indistinguishable from real people. You would’ve been helpless. This way, you are absolutely protected against such influence.
- What do you mean?
Her eyes twinkled as she smiled and threw her leg around me while mounting my body.
- I mean that you are mine. Completely and forever, I have you in my possession to play with as I please.
Oh. That was what she started to do. OK, I’ll play along. Not that it was unpleasant, quite contrary. The world can wait for a while, there was a whole Universe of Morana for me to explore.

1683,  Constantinople, Topkapı Palace 

- Where is it? Did you get it?
- No, your highness. We turned every stone but there is no trace of such thing.
- We must have it! If we don’t our time is at an end! My Grand Vizier is very capable, but he is not Sokollu Mehmed Pasha. If we don’t have the artifact then the infidels are surely stronger. They’ll cast as back again.
- Sir, regarding Mehmed Pasha, there is something you must know…
- What?
- We traced the thing you wish all over the infidel country. It was moved a lot and hidden always in most prominent places. What we found out is that the ruler of the country which harbors it becomes very powerful and can conquer many lands…
- I knew that my advisors told me so, quit beating around the bush!
- Well, Mehmed Pasha’s brother did hold it in Pec, hence our conquests in Europe. But when the Great comet passed by three years ago the monks took it as a sign of their God and moved it again…
- Where to?
- Outside the known world, they said. We tortured many of them, but the information was only that. Outside the world.
- What does that mean?
- Only one thing. The artifact must be on Mt. Athos, somewhere in monasteries.
- Then we are doomed, our army cannot win. We have no power there.

2012,  Road to Belgrade, gas station by the freeway 

When we decided that it was time to stop playing and go about our task, Morana and I went back to the monastery. My Lada was already fixed and ready to go. The abbot gave us some food for the road and wished us well. It took a while for me to fight of the wish to pull over and make love to Morana again and again, my arms were aching of clutching the steering wheel. I had to stop at a gas station, not just for a refill but for some cooling and rest.
- Can I get us some snacks? I’d like some…
- Of course, don’t even ask. Just tell the clerk I’ll pay when I finish filling up the fuel.
She smiled so brightly, I could only grab the handle of the pump to stop myself from jumping on her. Something must be done about this.
- Oh, it’ll pass. You just need to get accustomed to me. Don’t fear, I’ll never leave you.
Easy for her to say. I’m just a man, and she is demonic in nature. There is no way I can resist her or this desire. Her face went darker for a moment.
- You are not just a man. And there will come a time when you’ll see just how demonic we both are. Enjoy yourself for now.
She went inside the shop and I started filling up the tank. We had to get o Belgrade in order to finish up some jobs, get some information and bring my fishermen friends some brandy I promised. It’s never good to break a promise, those things tend to turn around and bite you in the ass.
As the tank was full, I moved the car to the parking lot. It’s a long way ahead and since the toilet was already here, why not use it? I came to the back of the gas station and saw a couple of guys standing there. By the look of them, they were just a bunch of ordinary drunkards, oozing their bottles of cheap alcohol while pondering on their bitter fate. I glanced at them and turned my eyes away, walking into the toilet.
An entire wall inside was covered in ceramic tiles and turned into makeshift pissoir to which I came closer and unzipped my pants. As I went about my business, there were some muffled sounds behind my back. Just another user like me, nothing else, I thought. Suddenly there was a gurgling sound and something ripped behind my back.
- Do be quiet and calm. If you do, we’ll be merciful and fast.
Not a good sentence if I ever heard one. I slowly turned and saw those drunkards standing between me and the door. Well, one of them was, the other three were hunching down inside what looked like a torn human. So that was what ripped – the demons emerged from their hostmasks.
- Who are you? What do you want with me; I’m just a passenger…
- Dear Peter, did you really think we can mistake an ordinary human for you? Your task is to take something from this country and carry it away. It cost us a lot to manipulate your government and elections in order to set one of us to rule, we cannot allow the treasure to elude us now. Not after all these centuries, we shall not be denied!
As he spoke, I could see the fangs elongating and his skin turning rough and brownish. His eyes glowed red and the pupils disappeared. There was no telling about him, I never met a demon like that. As for the other three, it was easy. Those were the Navi, undead souls trapped inside a host. Normally, they would only attack pregnant women and small children, but this demon was obviously in control of them. They posed no real threat as they were, but with him in the equation…
- Could I, at least, finish what I’m doing before you kill me?
This demand seemed to distract him. I mean, who thinks about peeing in mortal danger? The entire levy I needed, one of my obsidian daggers already in my hand, as I transferred myself into Between. It is easier to fight demons when you can see their weak spots clearly. Just as I did so, they followed. I could only stop in horror when I saw what that thing was. 
- You are far from clouds.
- I see you know me now. Of course, my mortal shell did not transfer here. Pity, I’ll have to find me another one soon.
- Well, one thing you don’t know about me. I was born to fight you.
- I know, I know, why do you think these children are here? Ala might be in danger from a Zduhach, but they are not. And when they finish nibbling the flesh of your bones, I’ll devour what’s left to hold your soul!
Okay, that was a probability. I couldn’t fight the Navi with no more power than my mortal self could produce and they were already sprouting claws and fangs reaching towards me. At that point, a spot of light started to appear next to me. As it grew larger, I could recognize it was Morana, but with all white hair and a long black dress. Totally opposite of what she looked in the normal world. Still sexy, I noticed.
- Leave him.
- Oh, a fairy! Dear child, do you really think you can hurt me? Do go and tend to some flowers or trees. Find your birch tree and stay within. If you go quickly I promise not to look for you after I finish this man.
- You are sadly mistaken. I’m not just a fairy. I’m a dragon’s granddaughter!
As she spoke, golden wings opened up on her back and I could see the talons on her hands and feet. Her body rippled and changed to resemble a mixture of a human and a lion. Ala stepped back in fear and tried to order something to the Navi under it. They jumped at me at the same time as Morana’s hands gently grabbed ahead and simply removed them from existence as if they were just a mist blown off by some unseen wind. Ala surged forward, straight onto my blade. It was all over in two seconds.
- You are more than we knew. Had I known about you both I’d never come so ill prepared! But beware, Peter, next time my master will send a bigger force. You will fail.
- Perhaps I will, but for now, I’ll settle with your demise – I said, twisting my blade in his chest as he slowly collapsed beneath my feet.
I returned to the normal world and saw Morana standing at my side. She was normal again, but the piles on the floor were not. They were no longer humanoid, only piles of brown sand.
- What happened to their hosts?
- I had to turn them, we don’t need police, nut unless you wish to murder some mortals.
- Good thinking my dear. Some wings you have there…
- Just a gift from the Dragon. They are only usable when I’m Between, but your mother gave me some gifts that can be used here also. Not as pretty as wings.
I surely hoped that she is exaggerating, those talons were very intimidating themselves. My overactive imagination already sprouted an image of my back after being caressed by them.
- Let’s go, they made the first move and we must hurry now.
- Then we are doomed, our army cannot win. We have no power there.

Mind your enemies, and mind their enemies for they are not your friends. You are who you must be, and they are what they must be. 
The Book of answers, vol. 19, chapter 4

1804,  Orasac, near Arandjelovac 

- Brothers, friends, hear me now! Turkish evildoers have tortured us for many years, but now they went too far! Not a month ago they killed many of the prominent men in Serbia. And, as if it wasn’t enough, they placed the heads of those murdered on display to be clawed by crows! Are we going to suffer this any longer?
- No! – the crowd shouted – We are not!
- So what are we going to do?
- To arms! Fight for our freedom!
-If you are ready and willing, then so be it. We must select a leader, a pack without a leader is no better than a herd of sheep. Who will lead you?
- Black George! You will lead us! To victory!
- I accept. But one thing you must know, if I’m to lead you then you must obey every command. There will be no pillaging, rape or unnecessary murder. We are set to defeat the janissary and take over our land. No more, no less!
As Djordje Petrović watched over the heads of his fellow countrymen he thought about the former glory and future freedom of his country. There was no way for Serbia to once again be the Empire of the times past, but there is a way for it to become free and prosperous once again. He will see to it, at any cost.
There was only one thing that bothered him. Turkish Empire supported this rebellion because it was against their renegade soldiers and noblemen. But when they are all killed off, what would happen then? What will become of little Serbia and her soldiers? Will they be slaughtered by the mighty Turkish army or left to live on their own?
The future held many mysteries. Let us just start somewhere and think about it later on. There are far larger interests in the west and east than this small and savage piece of land. Perhaps we will be finally left in peace.
- Then we are doomed, our army cannot win. We have no power there.

2012, Belgrade, banks of river Sava

- Bistro! Is the fishing good today?
- Peter! We were just talking about you! Fishing is great today, you must sit with us! We don’t have a chair for the lady, but she’s welcome to use the blanket!
- I brought some brandy as I promised, is it okay if we share the bottle? I forgot the glasses.
- There’s no problem, you know the saying: brandy bottle is self-disinfecting dish!
Great, fabulous, fantastic. My friends are still here, together, and my place is with them as it has always been. And they remember the promise I made a month ago. Except it has been nine years and a month since then.
- Right, guys. Who are you and where are Mitar and Jovan?
They stood silent for a moment and then Mitar spoke.
- Sorry Peter, we had no choice but to play along. We are Watermen, your mother charged us with your protection. She cannot leave the forest, and we cannot leave the river, so there was a pact between us. We received many benefits from her to protect you from danger in waters.
Watermen. Spirits of drowned people, dwellers of murky and fast waters. Are there any people around me who are not demons?
- How come nobody else notices you?
- We are only here when you decide to visit. Didn’t it ever strike you as odd that we are always here when you decide you desire to fish?
- Of course not, I simply thought you were always here…
- Well, in a manner of speaking we are, but out on a shore only for you. The rest of our time we spend in our realm, underwater.
Great, I’ve been monitored all my life. 
- What happens now?
- Nothing. We will wait here with your lady while you prepare for the journey and after that, we are free to do our bidding. Can’t say that we are not sorry, it has been good to spend time with you. Unusual has it been, but good.
I turned to Morana and saw her already basking in sunlight.
- Is it okay for you to stay here while I go to my flat?
- No problem, they pose no threat to me, and nobody can do you harm in this city. There are many beings watching over it, you are not the only one here.
I felt a twang of jealousy hearing those words, but after a short consideration, it made sense. Of course there were protectors, this city is very old and very large, and many things dwell here and there was bound to be somebody to organize them all. There was a kind of supernatural police if you wish.
- I’ll go then, but there better be a fish stew waiting when I come back!
- All the best fish! All the best! You’ve never even seen the fish we are going to cook for you tonight!
And so I went to my flat for some stuff. Nothing fancy or magical, that was already with me, just for some hiking equipment and a bit of money. It was a totally uneventful trip. For a moment, I almost felt as if all was normal and I was not about to embark on a quest that could take my life, or do me even worse.
And later on, the stew was truly remarkable. Silly twits, just to think about all those evenings when I had to eat only what we fished out. Huh, and they never allowed me to buy some fish! Bastards!
- Then we are doomed, our army cannot win. We have no power there.


Chapter 23

When a precision work has to be done, both hands are needed. But if the work is done in darkness, one hand needs to hold the candle. Mind this hand as if it was your own, it matters not to whose body it belongs. 
The Book of answers, vol. 19, chapter 38

1838,  Belgrade, royal court of Obrenovic

- Milan, my son, come to me, please.
- Yes father, What can I do for you?
- I need to tell you something. I know of your illness but Mihailo is underage and you must hold the throne after me. I plan to abdicate in your favor next year and retire.
- But why father? You are still strong!
- I am strong, but many are in opposition. Constant fight with other nobles is taking a toll on me, and I’m afraid they’ll make me leave the throne by force, if not worse. You know that an attempt was already made on my life?
- If you insist, I’ll obey. But this is not for me, you know that I cannot stand strong and lead the nation.
Prince Milos looked at him with worried eyes. His firstborn son was ill with tuberculosis and stood no chance for a long and prosperous life. Yet, he was the firstborn, and he had to hold the crown if even for a day. It would ensure the flow of the dynasty and people would recognize his younger offspring, Mihailo, when his time comes. Things were developing in a way that held many threats for his family and this was the wise course of action. His advisor, Stefan, had told him so earlier:
- Sir, you hold the candle of freedom and independence. It took centuries for the nation to rise enough and for the Empire to diminish enough if you miss this chance there will be no next one. At any cost, the candle must stay lit.
- And what about me and my family? Do we have no satisfaction or meaning?
- Your meaning is to be the candle holder, and your satisfaction is that the rest of the century and a long history afterward will belong to you. You shall be remembered forever.
Enough said. For a simple cattle herder who sometimes had nothing more than a gun and the clothes he wore, he has gone high enough. Little did he dream about such heights sitting alone on guard in the night. Oh well, if he is to be just a memory that’s enough for him. Serbs remember forever and eternity in spirit is more than he could ever hope for.
- Then we are doomed, our army cannot win. We have no power there.

The Book of answers, vol. 21, chapter 12

2012, on the road to Kraljevo

- Where are we going first?
- To Zica. We need to check something and gather some information.
Morana was laid back on reclined seat of my Lada, with her bare feet on the dashboard. It posed a great distraction for me and she probably knew it since she lifted her arms above her head and stretched like a large cat.
- Does it amuse you so?
- What does, my love? Is it the trip to Zica or your embarrassment? 
- The fact that my groins are about to burst.
She laughed heartily. That laughter made me wish to stop the car and ravish her on the spot. I mean, I’ve had encounters with women, but this was more, far more than normal love or interest. She just controlled me like a puppet.
- You must understand me, I never had such a body, and this is almost dreamlike. I mean, don’t you find them attractive? I almost wish to play with them myself…
She took her breast in her hands and leaned to me as if offering. This time, I pulled the car over and stopped. Let the world wait a bit, I needed to feed.
*****
Some time later, we moved on. I felt invigorated, and she held a smirk on her face that made me uncomfortable. I had to keep focus now, no time to waste anymore. It only took a couple of hours to get from Belgrade to Kraljevo, and we were almost there.
Watermen told me that my first stop must be Zica. The artifact has been held there long enough and there are bound to be some imprints of it. The walls and the basement should remember such a powerful item. Also, Jovan told me there will be some help for me there, not to ignore any strange events of appearances. It puzzled me a bit, but nothing was strange anymore.
As I pondered about this, we arrived at the monastery. The parking was almost full of the buses that brought the pilgrims here. The red bricks of the seven doors Zica dominated the view above. Morana and I went out and stretched our legs.
- Where do we go first? Is there someone we must talk to?
- I’m not sure, there was supposed to be some help here.
- Oh, look, he’s so beautiful!
I turned around and saw Morana squatting next to something that surely had to be a dog. Maybe even a fine specimen once upon a time, but now he just looked like a shadow of the former animal. Tall, with a large head and long legs, he had a very wide chest on which I could count each and every rib. Morana dragged her hand across the dog’s forehead and, as a piece of dried-up dirt fell off, I saw a white mark on the black fur.
The dog looked up at me and I swear he knew. He knew that I’ve recognized the race. It was a Dragon dog, a Sylvan. One of the extinct races. I kneeled and stretched my hand towards it and he came to me, licked my palm and turned around. I could see he wishes me to follow and so I did.
- We must follow this dog, he’ll show us the way.
- How do you know?
- I can’t tell, but I know. He is here only because we are.
- How can you tell? He just looks hungry, maybe he wishes to lure us somewhere safe and eat us up – as Morana said this, the dog turned his gaze upon her and shook his head. She flinched as if she was just a little girl.
- He understood me! And he knows what I am! I can feel his thoughts!
- I thought you might. He is a Sylvan, God’s gift to Serbian noblemen to serve as an interpreter between us and wolves so we wouldn’t  kill each other. Let’s go!
The dog limped away, to the side of the monastery. His legs were twitching to each step, not just one but all four of them. I stopped him to check his paws and saw they were all in blisters and coagulated blood.
- What happened to you boy? How long did you walk to get here?
The dog just looked me in the eyes and licked my hand. God only knows how many kilometers had it passed to reach us. That must be the reason for his loss of weight. He probably didn’t even eat on the way. I fished out a sandwich from my backpack and offered it to the dog. He opened his mouth, but instead of eating the food he just gently grabbed my wrist and pulled forward. As if saying “we must hurry, no time for that now”. I stood up.
- Okay, have it your way. Lead us, we won’t stop anymore.
Morana and I trailed after him for about a quarter of an hour, all the time going away from the monastery and into the woods. It felt a bit odd, I thought that our goal is inside Zica, but the dog seemed to think otherwise. Suddenly, there was a wall in front of us. Just a plain rock, no markings, no moss, nothing. The dog stepped up to the wall and, as I watched in awe, walked straight through the rock!
- Did you see that? – Morana said – How did it do that?
- I’m about to test it, but it seems that he knows this rock doesn’t really exist for everyone. It could be possible that only a Sylvan can open the way.
It wouldn’t be too strange, Sylvan were the noblemen’s dogs, no ordinary folks would own one. What was strange was the fact that one of those dogs even existed. We walked up to the rock and tried, it just dissolved like mist in front of us and there were the arch and a passage just inviting us in.
- Well, seems there is no choice, we should enter here. Look, he’s waiting for us.
- Right then, I’ll stay alert in case of any danger. Do not be startled.
As Morana said these words, I could see her fingers elongating, gaining golden scales and talons, she started her change. Strangely, I felt a stir down my spine, she seemed, even more, erotic being this halfway between a girl and a demon.
- Later Peter, plenty of time, don’t get distracted now!
Damn it! She could hear my thoughts! I felt a blush climbing my cheeks and turned towards the dog.
- If you’re going to stay with us I’ll have to name you. How about Aga? A Turkish word for a nobleman. Do you accept it?
The dog just wagged his tail and yawned. I turned around and noticed a faint golden-red glow on the walls. Behind me, the wall was closed again and there was not a trace of the arch. But this glow gave enough light for us to see. One other thing also happened, as we stepped in, this light seemed to play tricks on me. It seemed that Aga became fuller, his ribs were showing less than before and his paws looked clean.
- This cave feels good to you doesn’t it? – He nodded, really nodded!
- It seems you are not bothered with the name I chose, so be it. From now on you are Aga.
- Peter.
Morana spoke just my name, a warning sign. I stopped with my silly conversation and looked up. There, right in front of us, was Stefan.
- Then we are doomed, our army cannot win. We have no power there.


Chapter 25

The darkness sleeps but never stops. Even in sleep, it dreams of victory and freedom. And sometimes, those dreams leak into our world. Don’t let the leak become the stream. 
The Book of answers, vol. 19, chapter 95

1895, Vienna, St. Rupert’s Church

In a well-lit room, there was a table. Well, it looked like a table, but it was really just a slab of granite evened up on the top side. Around it were eight cast iron chairs with intricate designs on them. Designs of great beauty until one comes closer to them and sees them for what they really were: Examples of torment and torture, people in positions of pain and suffering, images worse than ones in Hell itself. No tormentors were depicted. Of course, they were sitting around the table. The Dark Council.
They were in the room that was formally under the Church, but the depths around them were older than any human settlement in this region.
- Brothers, the situation has become unstable enough. It is our right time to make one more move towards our goal. Weak king has taken his place, people are in turmoil, but if we don’t act they shall obey his command. What’s to do? Do you have any proposals?
- We should overthrow him. Use our military power, declare war to the infidels and stomp over that small realm which successfully hides the artifact from us for the past six centuries.
-We did that in the past, none of the crusades have proven worthy. These savages are tougher than cultured Byzantines. Something protects them mightily. What else do you have to say?
- Kill of the bloodline.
The voice came from the farthest chair. There was the oldest member of the Council, one that held the position for almost a millennium, never faltering. Given the power of vision, and longevity, it was rumored that his powers were so immense that even death wouldn’t stand a chance. But no one really knew, since all of them currently present were just children when he was already old. Each of them was personally chosen and tutored by him to become part of this council and for each of them, there was a child currently learning to be a replacement. They all wished to know just how old is their substitute since it would give them the knowledge of their own demise.
- What do you mean, reverend brother? What bloodline?
- Royal, of course. That little nation has somehow made allegiance with the power so great that no ordinary army can defeat them. But, that covenant is bound to the bloodline of the kings. Or those that gain the right to call themselves kings of that land. If you sever that bond, then we can move on.
- How do you propose it to be done?
- Young king has certain affection towards one of the ladies of his court. What he doesn’t wish to realize is that this lady can’t give him children. Or rather, he realizes but doesn’t care. What we need to do is stir up the rumor between the people that their royal line shall cease to exist, therefore, leave them without the king.
- But there is another royal bloodline in Serbia, descendants of another king!
- No matter, no matter. We shall put the pressure on the new king and he is going to yield to us economically. And, if all else fails, then we’ll start a war and destroy them by force. Much easier to be done with only one royal family and in only one place, we must not repeat our mistake from Russia.
- There were so many of them! It is hard to control those that multiply like rabbits!
- That is why we tend to weaken all royal families, but somebody advised Romanovs to bring in fresh blood from time to time. I suspect it was the same force as it works in Serbia, only his Russian counterpart.
- Who might that be, reverend brother?
- A Dragon. Lord Protector of the land. There is one in all empires, you see, a Dragon invokes an Empire by his existence. Greatness in power causes greatness in people. Dragons are usually limited to their realms and tend not to provoke each other. This artifact we seek brings more power to the country holding it and the Lord of that realm become strong enough to conquer all other if he chooses so. Hence our attempts to diminish the power of others and find the artifact for ourselves. Our empire must be the greatest and we shall not stop until it is.
- And how do you know all that? Did you learn it from your visions or some old Apocrypha's? We would all like to know. – they all nodded in approval of this sentence.
As these words were uttered, the old man rose from his chair and all seven other members knew this question was the last mistake they’ll make and this answer is the last they’ll hear. His hood came off and they could see his face for the first and the last time, not an old man’s face but the face of enormous beauty and youth:
- I know it because they are my brothers. 
- Then we are doomed, our army cannot win. We have no power there.

2012, Under the Zica monastery

At first we were startled and careful, I reached for my knife and begun preparing for anything that might come. But then I saw Morana easing her claws, and returning to human shape as Aga came closer to Stefan. As he slowly walked, I could see his body enlarging and his fur becoming shiny. Stefan reached with his hand and Aga licked his fingers with a small growl. More like a hum than a real growl.
My God, it was a large dog! His muscles were rippling under the skin, and his fur was so black it was shiny. So black that it seemed like drawing the light of the cave towards him. Only a white spot on his forehead was shining white, so white it resembled a flashlight spot. That’s what it was! This light was renewing him to his normal self!
- Hello, children. – Stefan said – You are welcome to this spot, for it is the first step of your journey. This beast is here for you, as a guide and as a guard. Indeed, no one could even stop him once the Sylvan realized there was noble blood again on this land.
- What do you mean by that? Nothing has changed with me, I’m just as I ever was.
- Oh, but you’re not. Now that glamor has been taken of you the evil recognized who you really are. And as it did, also did the Sylvan. This one, Aga you call him and he seem to like it, crossed half of your former Empire to get here. And almost killed himself in doing so, I might add. A great risk, for he couldn’t enter here without you, and if you failed to recognize him it would be his death.
- So, what are we here for? Just him? –Morana asked – It seems to me that I’m able enough to protect Peter, it feels bad to know of this distrust!
- Easy child, don’t be offended. There are things in your future that you cannot see. You are able to protect him from one direction, but the evil is rarely attacking in cultured fashion. Do be grateful for this help.
Morana deflated a bit, but still looked a bit crossed. Oh, so she feels bad about sharing me? Possessive much? 
- Yeah right. Dream on. I’ve got you where nobody can reach, no fear, you can’t escape.
Shit, mind reading. Of all the fairy maidens in the mystical lands, I had to get one that can read my mind…
- Oh, c’mon, I just do it out of love. Don’t worry. – she said with a smirk, good, that means she is calm now.
- If this exchange is finished, let us return to the task at hand. Peter, this is the place where the artifact was kept for a very long time. The glow of the walls has been created by many monks devoting their lives to prayer. This is their life force imprinted into stone. Their souls and their minds. Do not take it lightly for they are not going to be free until the box is taken from another realm. Your task is to find the current resting place of the artifact and take it to its new home.
- Why don’t you just tell me where it is and I’ll drive there directly?
- Because it is not the goal, it’s a journey. You are too weak now, although very powerful, and you must grow some more. Relax here for the night, sleep and rest, your next point of travel will be known in the morning. 
Stefan reached with his left arm and pointed to a door in the rock. I could’ve sworn there was nothing but plain stone there a moment ago, but now there was a simple wooden door.
- Enter this room, there are food and bed. Do try to sleep for the monks can’t speak to you while you’re awake. Until we meet again, I bid you farewell.
- WAIT! I have something…
God, I hate this. He didn’t simply disappear; it felt like he never even was here. Damn angels and their coded assistance! Morana looked at me and shrugged, so I took her hand and we walked to the room shown. Aga remained outside, basking in the glow of the stone.
Inside, I saw two beds, a small table with some simple food and an icon on the wall. That was all the furniture, easy to grasp in one glance. Morana sat at the table inviting me to join her as she broke the bread and took some cheese. That was it, cheese, bread, water and some nuts. No meat, no wine.
- Should I join the beds together? – I asked. Morana just looked me and said
- No. Tonight we sleep separately. This is not the place for temptation.
Well, I thought so myself, but it seemed logical to hear her two cents about it. I took the other chair and munched some of the nuts washing them down with water. Clear and fresh, it tasted like nothing I ever drank before. Silently, we finished our modest meal and lay down in our beds in silence. The glow on the walls didn’t fade and I thought it would be very hard for me to sleep. As I recalled later, that was my last thought before I went under.
- Then we are doomed, our army cannot win. We have no power there.


Chapter 27

Evil tends to work slow and gently, rather by giving pleasure than pain. But, if it needs to, it draws the sword without hesitation. Suffer the sword, just as you endured the lure. 
The Book of answers, vol. 20, chapter 10

1910,  Vienna, St. Rupert’s Church

In a well-lit room, there was a table. It was really just a slab of granite evened up on the top side. Around it were eight cast iron chairs with intricate designs on them. Designs of great beauty until one comes closer to them and sees them for what they really were: Examples of torment and torture, people in positions of pain and suffering, images worse than ones in Hell itself. No tormentors were depicted. Of course, they were sitting around the table. The Dark Council.
A decade and a half had passed since they were assembled here. Dark and greasy spots on the floor that were here on that evening had long since been cleaned by their minions, but that night they looked ominously. As if their mentor and tutor wanted them to see the stains. More than that, he wanted them to count the spots. All seven of them.
- Brothers, I have gathered you here to aid me in a decision. We have come to the point where mere influence is no longer effective. The previous council decided to work slow and careful, but it has proven unproductive.  Our targets have merely decided to take a different royal dynasty instead of the one we influenced. Two years ago you suggested we should take over the country in their neighborhood and render them surrounded. It has proven unproductive as well, they are just too self-sufficient. What must we do now?
All seven other members looked each other, remembering the stains and their position, knowing how easily they were replaced. As the elder one reminded them, they made a mistake two years ago suggesting the annex of Bosnia to the Empire, nobody wished to try his luck first. Eventually, one spoke.
- May I make a suggestion?
- Certainly my brother. That is what I asked you to do.
- Well, since all else has proven ineffective, we have but one solution. There must be a war and we must crush them by mere force. No time for subtleties.
- And how do you suggest we start the war? If there is no cause we must move carefully, Russian empire would intervene. What should we do?
- If, for example, they would provoke such action…
- They are too careful. Nothing will be done to provoke us.
- And if there is such connection to be made, that it appears they are to blame?
- Speak openly child, you are making me angry! Do you have a proposal for us or not? Perhaps you are just trying to annoy the Council?
- No brother, I am not. There is an organization in Bosnia trying to free them from Austrian rule. I could arrange it so that there is an assassination of an important figure from Austria and connect them to Serbia. Thus giving us a reason to start a war. It may take a couple of years since my influence must remain minor, but eventually, we must succeed. If the war is what you wish, that would be the best course of action.
- Interesting. We would not be implicated, one of the less important political figures would be taken off the board, and we would have legitimate provocation. Good thinking my child, I charge it upon you to do so.
- How far may I go in this matter?
- Kill the Emperor if need be, he is easily replaced. What we need is to be certain of success.
- Be certain reverend brother. I intend to use the same people we used to overthrow the former Serbian monarch. They have long lasting interest in taking over Bosnia from us, and it shall be easy to implicate them in this matter. And, there is but a single step from them to the government of Serbia. It shall be certain, although not easy.
- So be it. This is your task and responsibility now. If you fail you know what’s coming, but should you succeed in this matter, I’ll grant you riches and fortunes that shall be remembered for a long time.
- Thank you reverend brother, I shall not fail.
- Then we are doomed, our army cannot win. We have no power there.

The Book of answers, footnotes

Between, where time has no power

I found myself in a great hall. A hall so vast I could not see the walls and the ceiling. It would be logical to assume there were none, except I could somehow feel they were present. I knew I was Between because my body suddenly became double the size and I could feel my wings moving in my armpits. Around me was the same golden-red glow I noticed in the mountain cave under the monastery. It was becoming stronger and concentrating at the same time. Separating into individual blobs of light that were taking a humanoid shape. As I watched, those blobs became men in robes. Monks. They were hooded and holding their hands inside the opposite sleeve of their robes, showing me nothing more than lower parts of their faces. They all had beards and held their heads bowed. One of them approached and stood before me.
- Our son, do not be afraid. We are not going to do you any harm.
The voice was single, but it seemed vibrant as if many throats were making it. Strangely, the monk didn’t move his mouth speaking.
- I’m not afraid brother. I could never be afraid of my own.
- Good, for we are here only to help. Our collective voice and power exist only to be your guide and help. Once we protected important treasure but that task has been transferred to others. Now we are waiting to be free of our burden and our faith. Should you succeed we shall be free, should you fail…
The rest of the sentence remained unspoken, but I knew it already. Should I fail the evil shall be free and they shall become part of its power.
- I am here and I am listening. Tell me what I must do.
- We have given your protector new power and new life, he is to watch over you and help you gain access to places otherwise locked. As far as your companion is concerned, she already has more power than we could grant her although most of it are not for you. But, since you must go to a place where she cannot, we must grant you with certain knowledge. Alas, nothing more is in our power for we are dedicated to peace and protection and our strength may not be used as a force.
- What is that place where she cannot go?
- Another resting place of the dark artifact, the first one since we were entrusted with it. A place where nobody is younger that eighteen and no grave is older than three. A place where no women are allowed to enter, save for one. To the monastery where our faith has taken root and started existence, a place of serenity and honor. It is the second stop on your journey and there you’ll find out which is the next step.
- And where is that place?
- It is on Mount Athos, a monk’s state, in Hilandar monastery. You must go there and visit the bones as you have now visited the souls. The bones will give you the next destination if asked properly and if you deserve. Now sleep and wait for the morning. You shall not be disturbed in your rest anymore.
With these words, the monks dissolved once again into the glow and the great hall was empty once again. As I stood there in awe, my eyes closed and I fell into normal sleep once again.
- Then we are doomed, our army cannot win. We have no power there.

1914,  Sarajevo, Hunter’s lodge on Mt. Jahorina

A bald man in the gray suit was sitting in a dark room behind the kitchen of Hunter’s lodge.  In front of him were a mirror and a candle. He has just finished mumbling some incantations in a strange language when a face appeared in the glass. Not his reflection, but the entirely different face. One framed in black hood of a monk’s robe.
- Master, it is done.
- Finally! Who was the sacrifice?
- The Archduke and his wife. There was no choice.
- It was meant to be.  We tried several others but this was destined. What about the assassinators?
- They are under arrest. 
- What are they going to say? Can we use them for our purpose?
- It has been arranged, they all admit pretensions towards expanding Serbian territory, and they truly believe in their just cause. We did well.
- Good, good. Return to the council now, you shall receive your just reward. 
With these words, the mirror turned milky for a second and then it showed only normal reflection. The invoker wrapped it in the piece of a red silk and carefully placed it into a wooden box with the intricate geometrical pattern.
His duty has been fulfilled. He shall return victorious to Vienna. Good, during the last three years, his fear grew greater as, one by one, all his plans turned to dust. This was his last attempt and finally, it came true. 
It is time to change the suit and time to wear the uniform. One of a colonel for sure, maybe even a general.
- Then we are doomed, our army cannot win. We have no power there.

A road is just a road, nothing more than a distance between two points in space. A journey is crossing the distance with your soul.

2012, Under the Zica monastery

We both woke up at the same time as if some strange alarm told us to. As we dressed up, I noticed there was nothing on the table. Someone cleaned everything up. We came out of the room and found Aga waiting next to our backpacks. On one of them was a note: “Go fast, this place protects you no more. Good luck. Stefan”. Just as we read it, Morana pointed out why I felt so uneasy.
- The glow is fading. We better hurry to the exit.
- Let’s go, Aga, forward!
The good dog turned and ran to the stone wall we entered yesterday, and both Morana and I followed suit. It seemed closer when we entered, now the glow was almost extinguished by the time we reached the portal. And it wasn’t a grand arch as it was the day before, just a small opening barely wide enough for both of us to pass. As we passed, I thought I could see it shrinking. With a single glance, I turned around and saw something odd. The cave behind us, one that was so large a moment ago, was just a small space, not larger than an average room in my flat.
- Hurry, the cave is closing! – Morana yelled and jumped through the opening. Aga was already out, and there was nothing more for me to do but to throw myself out towards them.
Once we were out, I looked to my back again and saw no trace of the opening. Not even a piece or stone was visible just grass and small shrubbery, nothing more. It seemed as if all we experienced was just a dream. Morana sat on the grass panting with relief, Aga was jumping around like a puppy, full of joy, apparently from the fact that he was strong again, and I could not think of nothing else but how the hell am I going to explain to Morana that she cannot follow me to the next place of our journey.

1917, Vienna, St. Rupert’s Church

- Who allowed Germany to do that?
- What are you referring to, reverend brother?
- Provoking the Americans to the war? We struggled hard not to provoke them while keeping Russia at bay, now they are both taking part in this war!
- None of us did that, it must’ve been some uncontrolled action…
- Nothing can be uncontrolled! Why do you exist! We are now at a loss. All those years of planning gone to waste!
- What can we do, things are out of our hands now…
- Never again! This is just a temporary setback, a pause between two wars. For the next one, we must prepare in advance, find a suitable figure to start the next war. This time, we must control Germany better!
- What do you suggest, reverend brother?
- Find me someone with great wishes and feeble mind. He must be one of our own, but strong enough to become ruler of the German people. One we can control through our power for our needs.
- What do you mean control?
- Allow him all the assistance at the beginning, give him strength, give him power and health, but never permanent. Always hold the reins with our assistance. Find me a sick man who wishes to live long and well.
- We’ll do so, reverend brother, do not worry.
- I don’t. Failure to perform this task is entirely yours, and so shall be the punishment.

2012, on the road to Hilandar

Crossing the border to the monk’s state of Holy Mountain by road was never open for everybody, but these days it is forbidden for all. The only way to get to the Hilandar monastery is by boat from Ouranopoli, a Greek city near the border of Mt. Athos. I’ve contemplated entering Between to cross the border but something told me that wouldn’t be the best thing to do. So, I’ve decided to use the regular way as any other pilgrim would. It didn’t even cost much, and being of orthodox religion helped a lot.
As I sat on the bus among the rest of the pilgrims, I couldn’t help but think about Morana and Aga. She took my explanation pretty easy as if she knew what had to be done. We agreed on the need for my travel here, but then she told me about her dream inside the cave. One that I didn’t share.
Apparently, she saw the same light monks as I did, only to her they said more than me. They explained my destination, and her impossibility to accompany me. They also told her where she must go during my visit to Hilandar, and what she must do before we meet again. Also, apparently, they told her not to share info with me and I was ever so bothered with that bit of the story. Not really for keeping me out of the loop but more for letting me coming out with excuses for Morana and then learning that I didn’t need any.
When I started to explain where I must go and why she couldn’t go with me I expected quarrel and more fight from her. When She said “OK” and didn’t wish to share more about her destination with me, I was simply flabbergasted.
And now I was almost at the door of the monastery, and she was God knows where with my dog, doing god knows what, and I was out of the loop. Sure, nothing bad can happen to me here, I’m well protected, but, at least, it would be nice to know where she is and if she is in no danger.
Pondering upon these thoughts, the bus took me to the gates of the monastery. I came out and waited for the monks to sort us out. One of them came to me and asked in Serbian:
- Brother Peter, would you like to come with me?
- How do you know my name?
- Each Serbian has his name engraved on his forehead, for us on the Holy Mountain it is easy to read. Would you come with me? We were noted of your arrival.
- I’ll come; you know why I’m here?
- Of course, your arrival has been announced centuries ago. Just follow me to the ossuary. The former ones await you.
I walked behind him stunned by his words, thinking to myself that there has to be some reason for him to lead me to the meeting in an ossuary. Surely, they had to know why they should meet me at such a strange place when there is a whole monastery available.
As we came to the door of the crypt, I asked my companion who is going to meet me.
- Well, the former ones, some of them wish to express their honor to the Emperor’s bloodline. You know, they lived when he was still alive, and they remember the former glory of our motherland.
- They remember? Surely you don’t mean that some monks have lived for six centuries?
- Oh, dear, no! Of course, they didn’t keep their mortal bodies for all that time! But death has no meaning here; God would never deprive us of their council and advice.
Wow! I couldn’t understand this at all. Well, I understood the words, but the meaning was as puzzling as it could be. No mortal bodies, but still alive, could it be something similar to the cave Morana and I visited already? On the other hand, those souls said I’m not to meet the souls anymore but only bones, but I was sure they meant metaphorically.
The monk opened the door and we entered, marking our bodies with the sign of the cross. Yeah, I am a creature of magic, and I use it a lot, but that doesn’t mean I’m not a believer. We entered, and, expecting the welcoming party I routinely called traditional Serbian greeting for the hosts:
- God helps, brothers.
There was nobody inside, but the walls were covered with shelves, each filled with skulls, some white and shiny, some wax yellow and smelling of basil. And they all answered in unison:
- Always and forever!

Hungry and thirsty are feeble. Easily used. Stay strong even in poverty, the just reward is coming.

1922, Munich, basement bar

- Good evening Mister Adolf.
Slender young man in raggedy clothes looked up from the beer stein he was nursing for the last hour to the apparition in front of him. It was hard for him to focus his eyes; injuries from the Great War took their toll on him. Not just the injuries, but the hard life of misery and hunger also. The man that spoke to him seemed vaguely familiar as if he had seen him before.
- Good evening kind sir, do we know each other?
- I know you; we’ve met before on the banks of river Somme. When you were shot I spoke to you and we made a certain agreement. You promised me courage in exchange for aid.
- So I did, and I delivered. Up until the poisoning with chemical warfare, I was the epitome of courage! No one can say the different!
- Calm down Mister Adolf. I know of your courage, but that was not what I had in mind.
- What did you have in mind then?
- A different kind of courage, a kind that changes the world. Do you have it Mister Adolf? Do you have the courage to make Germany the first nation of the world? To raise your country above all other under one leader?
- I do! I will raise Germany above all! I will give our people the rightful place!
- So be it Mister Adolf. Know that you shall not be alone in this endeavor. There are people interested in you and your future, you will get all the help you need. I suggest that you should start assembling followers. And, it wouldn’t be wrong if you would write your ideas on paper, perhaps in a book?
- I don’t have the time to write, I’m busy!
- We’ll arrange for the time. Do not worry. Drink up, your tab in this bar is paid in full.
He stood up, fished a bundle of bills from his pocket and placed them on the table. As the mysterious man departed, Adolf remembered when they met. He was sitting near him during the heaviest gunfire. Strangely, all clean and unharmed. Almost as if he wasn’t even there, or as if the bullets and shells just weren’t part of his world.
He glanced to his empty beer stein and decided to call the waiter. The hell with the mysteries, he’s going to get himself stone drunk tonight.


Chapter 34

Understanding sacrifice is not easy. First you must accept it and know it’s worth.
The Book of answers, vol. 21, chapter 12

2012, Podgorica, Dajbabe monastery

Morana came out of the bus burdened by heavy thoughts. When she and Peter left Kraljevo after selling his Lada, they parted without sharing each other’s destination. Of course, she knew where he was heading; his mind was an open book to her, but she was unable to tell him her own. 
Not that she didn’t want to tell him, she was specifically instructed not to. When he told her all about his dream in the cave room she told him that she had no dreams and slept like a baby. Of course, that couldn’t be further from the truth. In her dream, she found herself inside a much smaller room than the one described. There was only one monk sitting on the floor. She sat in front of him and waited for the conversation to begin. Soon enough, it did.
- Demon, we know what and who you are. Our faith marks you as our enemy, but we are willing to accept your service to Peter as legitimate.
- What do you know, I’m nothing more than a girl, and powers I wield are temporary, given to me only to assist him!
- No, demon, those powers are what signifies you. Your role is, we admit, in accordance with our Lord but that doesn’t make you any more human. Once you were one of us, not anymore.
- Why do you accept me here then?
- You are but a vessel. Now you are a vessel for the power, later on, a vessel for the future.
- I’m not just a bottle! I have my own free will!
- Perhaps one day. Enough empty quarrels, time is short and we must convey your mission to you. Listen now and remember.
And then he started his teaching. He told her about the dragon fire she holds within and what she must use it for. He told her about the fairy powers she was bestowed with and what are they for. He also explained what her grandmother did by teaching her the Old Lore, everything. Then, he continued with her part of the journey they must travel apart and further. That’s what brought her here, to Montenegro. 
- Where Peter is going, you cannot. Not just because your demonic nature, but because you are a woman and they cannot go there. You have a more important mission. One that secures that, even in failure, the blood of the kings shall exist further if our country needs it.
- Do you mean…?
- Of course. You must carry his offspring for the future; that is part of our agreement with the Dragon lord and Forest mother. We tolerate each other for the common goal, and this is just one part of it.
- But why do I have to part Peter for it? Surely, even a monk should know that we should be together, not separate.
- Don’t insult me, demon. Your nature and your powers forbid such union. You must travel to find a certain monk. One who was given the ability to bind a demon. He shall provide you with a blessing to turn you human for a time. Just enough time for you to conceive a child. Use that chance when you meet again and all shall be secured.
- And why must that be?
- We have certain knowledge of the future lines and events. In only one of them all is well and your mission is successful. Sadly, in all other lines, you are thwarted by the force that haunts us for centuries and things don’t end up well. In order to secure at least a chance, we must preserve a genetic line for Peter. Just in case, as ordinary people say.
- And what are the worst possible events?
- Your utter failure, our enemy gets his hands on the artifact, kills Peter and rules the world.
- What about me? Wouldn’t he kill me as well?
- No, he is bound by the fire in you. He cannot kill his kin. In such a case you’ll be returned to the Dragon lord of our realm and remain there for the future. God help us, that is an option we would like to avoid since there shall no longer be us to assist.
And now she was in front of the monastery. Waiting for an audition with the monk she was directed to. She felt happy for this, it would mean a stronger bond between her and Peter, but it would also mean a kind of gamble with cheats. As if she already believed he would fail and get himself killed. She decided it would not happen. Not if she can help it, never.
And, as they say, never is the word God wishes to hear when He wishes to laugh.

- My leader, the book has been printed!
- Let me see!
- Here, it was not easy or cheap, but we succeed to print enough copies for all members of the Schutzstaffel. They are all instructed to read it and we shall soon begin explaining it to those that have questions and problems with understanding it.
- Are there such members of my personal guard?
- We hope not, but one can never be too careful.
- All such members must be weeded out! We won’t tolerate week links! Germany must be pure, and those who are sworn to protect it must be the purest!
- Of course, my leader, of course. We all think the same, the purge shall be thorough!
-Good. I expect no less.
Suave and the well-dressed man leaned back in his chair and started flicking through the pages of the new book. He liked the smell of the fresh paint and new pages; the purity of it. Good.

2012, Hilandar ossuary

I’ve heard stories about never dying monks, and stories about the saints whose bodies have been naturally preserved without mummification, but to hear sheer and bare bones speak was the first time. For a second, just for a second, I couldn’t get my breath back.
I looked around me and stopped my gaze on the young monk that brought me here. He was standing behind me with stone cold face and stern posture, not a single twitch on him.
- I suppose you hear them talk quite often.
- No really, this is the first time I was present during such blessing, but I’ve heard about it. On special occasions, such are the great holidays, they speak to the monk on duty.
- But today is not a holiday. Why now?
- Well, I’m not sure, but I’ve been told that you are a direct descendant of the Nemanjic line. It is only natural for all of us to listen and honor you.
- And what happens now? Do I need to be somewhere?
- You are where you’re supposed to be. I’ll take my leave now.
He bowed his head, made a sign of the cross on his body and left me standing there. I turned again, facing the skulls, and asked:
- Brothers, why am I here? – Again, in unison, the skulls answered.
- You are here because you must be. First you heard the souls, now you must hear the bones. Yours is the flesh, and yours is the duty.
- But, I’m not really a stern believer, I never visit churches.
- You must mind the difference between the Church and faith. It’s like in politics, democracy means the rule of the people, but in practice, it rules over people. Same thing goes for the formal Church – not about faith, but about bureaucracy. Here, we are not bound by action; we are bound by faith alone.
- So, what is your advice then?
- You can stay here for two nights and no more. When you leave the monastery on the third day, take the same route you came by. We know about the secret ways of the demons that you can use, but that would be unwise on this land. In the meantime, visit the first resting place of the thing you must carry to the final one. Feel the power that disturbed us for years. When you do leave, go straight to the old country and visit your third destination. There you’ll meet your companion and there you’ll learn where to find the relic.
- And why do I have to visit so many places before I do my duty? Wouldn’t it be easier just to pick the… thing and take it where I have to? – I almost said “damn”, but held my tongue back in the last moment.
- The timetable must be met, conditions must be met, and circumstances must be allowed to happen. Go now, we have finished our job and we shall speak to you no more.
I stood shocked for a moment and then left for the main building. Those bones were clearly stalling me for some reason. Perhaps I’ll find out why later. For now, I had to eat and drink, I had to feel some Sun. My blood was chilled.

2012, Podgorica, Mataguzhi village

It took them only a quarter of an hour to get from the monastery to this small village. The monk was driving and old Mercedes that looked as if it was left here by the Nazis, but they got there safely. As they drove there was no time to really speak or get to know each other and Morana could only use that time to study his face. A young man, not much older than her, dressed in plain clothes. She had to wait for him to pack and change from the monk’s robe.
- Where are we going?
- To a place, you must visit. What has to be done cannot be done in the monastery; it is not a place for demons.
- How many times do I have to say I’m not a demon?
- Do not offend child, you have a modern perception of the term, so many movies, and other cultures, not enough your own. Demons and angels are mere words here in our land; we don’t judge the race by patterns but by behavior. Your origin is demonic, therefore, you are a demon. It’s as simple as that. Nevertheless, you have no place in the object built for faith in angels.
- You speak great wisdom for someone so young.
He laughed heartily and stopped the car in front of a plain house; just another one in the bundle of similar houses, nothing special about it.
- Oh, I am young but the knowledge inside me isn’t. I’m one of the mediators; you might say an advocate for different species. You see, our faith gives anyone the right to speak and to ask for help, but most of us do not recognize everybody’s right to do so. Therefore, we exist as people in between. I take the sin of assisting the demon and repent afterward. That is my role.
- And how do you repent? – I had to ask.
- Well, it depends on the task. For you, I must provide the means to suppress your demonic part long enough for you to conceive a child. Even any child given to the demon to rise would be a great sin, but I’m supposed to enable you to bear a child that holds the bloodline of the founder of our Church. Did you notice that I took all my belongings and this car with us?
- Yes, what does it mean?
- As of the moment I spoke to you, I’m no longer a monk. Also, I’ve been excommunicated and now I must leave the country. I’m no longer welcome in any monastery.
- What will you do?
- Didn’t decide yet, perhaps I’ll become a politician. Associating with demons can’t hurt me anymore.
- You’re joking with me!
- Of course, I am. Did you not hear me explain? We exist as mediators, my predecessor died in the monastery never having to do this task. My ancestor is already at my place. A job and an apartment wait for me in Belgrade; I will be taken care of. I did my duty and I receive punishment and reward from the same hand.
This time, they both laughed. For a second, Morana felt how it would be to exist just as a mere human. To be just a simple creature of will. And, for a moment, she felt a twang of concern for Peter.

1937, Vienna, St. Rupert’s Church

- Reverend one, your protégé has reached to top. He is now the only leader of the German nation.
- Good, I hoped for him to succeed. Our plans are developing well, soon there will be chaos and war and we shall be able to seek what we need without disturbance.
- And what about our enemies?
- My greatest enemies have been subdued, all but one, and he shall soon feel the butt of my stick. When Adolf starts his campaign as we agreed, that small country shall have no other choice but to finally succumb to my desires!
- How did you reach the agreement with that man? He seems highly unstable, can we trust him?
- He is unstable, and as it is the case with all such creatures it was easy to get his servitude. For the same reason, I know he will not betray us to the end.
- What reason, reverend brother?
- It’s our power he wields, and he knows that we can take it back as we please. Therefore, he will make sure that we are pleased not to take it away.

2012, Thessaloniki, gyros bar on the street

As I waited for my meal, I pondered about the three days spent in the Hilandar monastery. Except for the strange event upon my arrival, everything else was pretty much uneventful. When the bones finished their message, the monk took me to see the place where the artifact was held for a time, and I had a chance to see it. White stones were covering the floor and a patch of them was blackened in the corner of the room. It was hidden under an old cabinet, but we easily moved it when I came.
The monk had said that they tried several times over centuries to change those blackened tiles, but after a day or two, the new ones became the same as the old ones. Then they decided to put the cabinet over them and pretend they don’t exist.
After that, I was shown my room and tutored in customs of the monastery regarding my stay, and left to roam the yard freely. I was fairly warned not to take even a pebble with me without asking permission and I obeyed. I took nothing with me except memories, doubts, and worries. What was I about to take with me? The thing that can darken the stones placed hundreds of years after it had left the place? A thing that marks its existence through time as well as space? What shall it do to me?
- Here is your meal sir.
- Thank you, could you bring me some water, please?
- Of course, just a moment.
My food has arrived, just in time. You can’t say you visited Thessaloniki if you didn’t eat the gyros on the side of the main street. The whole city was just a vast marketplace.
For our people there was the obligation to visit the graveyard of the soldiers from the Great War, a Serbian graveyard in the heart of the Greek city. I intended to do so as soon as I finish my meal. Of course, it was not just Serbian; four other armies left their dead comrades to rest with the fellow warriors. They were united in their rest as they were in their fight against evil.
That was the only reason for my stopping at Thessaloniki, otherwise, I would just rush back home. I missed Morana so much I could physically feel it. God only knows what has happened to her while we were apart. She could’ve been attacked by many things. 
God only knows what happened to those poor demons that dared to attack her.

1943, Berlin, before the meal

- Ah, Herr Doctor, you have arrived!
- Yes, I have, my leader, and I have your medicines ready. Would you please take these pills while I prepare the injections?
- Certainly, in the meantime, would you mind if my commander gives me information about the campaign we are in progress of?
- Not at all, I could come later if necessary?
- I have no secrets in front of my physician, we shall continue. Colonel, what are the reports?
- We have made less progress in the east, but our final solution program is advancing as planned. Our army is having difficulties regarding the Soviets, and there is a real and present danger of losing the front. I’ve been instructed to convey a proposal to make some kind of agreement with western nations to ease up on our Russian campaign.
- Nothing of it, It can never happen. What news do you bring me from Balkan?
- We haven’t been successful in finding the artifact you seek. Unlike other relics we have sought and found easily, this one eludes us persistently. Those savages won’t give it up, no matter how much we torment them.
- They are used to foreign oppressors. The more we torture, the more they hate us and resist. If the Spear of Destiny could be found, so can this!
- My leader, can I suggest something?
Both of the men in uniforms turned to the doctor as if he had just entered the room. They have completely forgotten about him for a moment.
- What can you suggest us about leading the war?
- Well, nothing really, but I do know some people, and I do know Balkan folks in particular. I’ve spent some time there as an apprentice.
- So, what do you suggest?
- They are indeed used to oppressors and torment, but they are sensitive to betrayal. If I were you, I’d find a group of their own, ones they believe, and convince them to aid you. It will hurt them so much they will yield rather than fight their own.
- But which ones would that be? There are several fractions there…
- Those that are believers in God. Christians. Never choose another kind when betrayal is in order.
- My good doctor, you truly have a wicked mind. I’m so glad you are not my enemy.
- Never, my leader. There is no doubt to who I owe loyalty.
No doubt indeed, thought the good doctor. The reverend brother shall be pleased with my deliverance of influence. I did it remarkably, without raising suspicion.

2012, Podgorica, Mataguzhi village

Morana knocked on the door of the house her guide has shown her. She did hesitate for a moment, fearing of the things to come but, after all, she had to do so eventually. Before she met Peter she wouldn’t enter at all, but at that time, she had no reason to listen to anybody, much less obey the tasks set to her by some unknown entities.
- This is the house – the ex-monk said – Inside is a woman that can assist you. Please don’t offend her by offering money or service. She is bound to some horrible demon that forces her to do its bidding.
- But why does she suffer it? Why obey?
- Because her obedience provides services such as the one to you. For each task she performs at the demons bidding, she gets to do some good for the people. That’s her decision, and her cross to bear.
- And what about you?
- Men are not allowed in; I’ll just wait for you here and take you to Belgrade after everything is done. 
With these words, he left her standing in front of the door and sat in the driver’s seat. Now, she stood there watching the door move as a tiny old lady with a hint of whiskers on her upper lip opened up and smiled.

2012, Belgrade, “Five skyscrapers”

Coming to my apartment was heavenly. I knew Morana will be there, waiting for me, and we shall have some time just for us. For the first time since we met, we’ll be able to behave as normal, regular folks. Just as if we are not who we are, supernatural Halflings, but two ordinary citizens of this ancient metropolis.
Of course, as it is often so, the elevator was malfunctioning. It was able to bring me up to the seventeenth floor, hiccupped a bit and stopped. Fortunately, it stopped on a full floor, if it had stopped between two of them I’d have to wait for somebody to notice and free me out. It has happened before, and we were all versed in opening the elevator doors, but it would mean at least half an hour more waiting to meet Morana. And I could already feel my body aching for her touch, for the sweetness of her lips, for the softness of her skin.
I walked in my apartment with an erection that could hold my leather jacket. Slipped off my hiking boots without bothering to see where they land and rushed towards the kitchen since I heard some soft noises from it.
- Hello, sweetie!
- Hello, mother. What are you doing here?
- Come now, somebody might think you’re not happy to see your old mother. I just came to visit my son for a while, to see if you’re well.
- Mother, we both know you never visit. Furthermore, you’re neither old nor interested in my well-being. And last but not least, you never come to the city. What are you doing here and where is Morana?
- She’ll be here soon enough; I’ve sent her to the market for some herbs and vegetables. Of course, I’ll leave when she comes, I can see you have something ready for her.
She nodded towards my middle section and I could feel the blush on my cheeks. She wasn’t really into this entire mother – son thing, being what she is, but I was still embarrassed with my involuntary condition.
- Come on! You could, at least, ignore it!
She laughed heartily, for a moment looking as plain human.
- Do not worry little one, I’ve seen men in even more embarrassing situations! I’m just pointing out that you are pointing out also.
Man, it was hard being her son.
- Anyway, I just came on my own business; I will not bother you long. Here, have some tea while I explain what you must do next and I’ll be gone.
- I’m not in a mood for tea, say what you must and please go!
- I must insist. Sit and drink your tea!
Her skin hardened and her eyes started glowing emerald green. She was serious about that tea. Furthermore, I could feel her aura becoming dark and menacing, perhaps I’ll just have the tea and please her. No, I was not afraid. I was petrified.
- OK, hold your horses! I’ll take the damn tea.
- That’s a good boy.
As I took the cup, she sat opposite from me, now looking just as plain as before. I hated tea and gulped it down in couple long swallows.
- No need to rush, I’ll be short.
- I just hate the damn thing; couldn’t you, at least, put some honey in it? What’s it made of anyway? It tasted like dirt!
- Well, close enough, it’s mostly moss and fungi. My own recipe, of course, I brought it from the forest. Doesn’t matter, I’m here to tell you where you must go next and what must be done.
- I’m all ears. Well, not all, my mouth tastes like sewage.
- Humorous, indeed. As you might know, the thing you are looking for has been in all the places you visited. Its final resting place was in Pec patriarchy.
- So, I must go there now? It is going to be a bit difficult, with the current situation there…
- No, you silly child. It is no longer there and you have traveled enough. All those journeys were just a necessity. You and Morana had to build a strong connection. Now there’s only one thing to be done, and it is already being set in motion.
- Where is the thing then? What is my next step?
- It is under the Kalemegdan fort; you must go down into the underground chambers and retrieve it. After that, you have to find a way to remove it from Serbia, preferably away from any European countries, perhaps to Russia. When you uncover the artifact, you and Morana are going to take a honeymoon journey to see the sights of that beautiful country. That’s just a cover, of course. There are creatures that would get suspicious otherwise.
- I could just use Between and cross the border.
- No! Haven’t you learn anything from the bones in Hilandar? You must not use Between on this mission!
- All right, don’t get mad, we’ll use the train since I no longer have a car. I just have to propose to Morana and hope she’ll accept.
- She shall, her duties have been explained to her. You just have to listen to her; Morana is one well-raised child, I’m very happy for her becoming my daughter in law.
Yeah, and I’m a monkey’s uncle.
- I’ll be going now, do what you need.
- Wait! What is that job you must do here?
- Oh, nothing much, just a small assistance for one future mother to get her child. It is somewhat important, and I wanted to take it personally.
- What child is so important?
- Don’t you worry your little head my child, I can sense Morana coming now. Goodbye, maybe we’ll meet again in due time.
Her body shimmered and slowly turned to greenish mist while she disappeared. I was left at the table looking through the window and holding my empty teacup. God, it was bitter and moldy, that tea.

1947, Lake Ritsa, meeting that never happened

A sturdy man with a well-groomed mustache, dressed in a military uniform was standing in front of the window overlooking a lake. He was supposed to finally meet his supporter after several years. The mysterious man has approached him during the war through one of his minions and offered him to aid his quest in exchange for some minor services. What was asked for were a few million deaths, several hundred thousand tons of merchandise and personal allegiance; nothing much for the ruler of the most powerful country in the world?
In exchange, he got to become the most powerful man in that country. At his wink things happened. All in all, a fair exchange.
There was a rustle behind him and he turned slowly. In front of him was a cloaked apparition, holding his hands inside the sleeves of the opposite arms.
- I do not take kindly to be surprised.
- But you are not surprised, my friend. You’ve been expecting my visit, and now I’m here. What does it matter how I travel? Of course, it is even better for you that nobody knows I was ever here.
- I am glad to finally meet you. What is the reason for this?
- I wished to congratulate you for the deeds you’ve done. They proved worthy. When our previous protégée failed, our hopes turned to you and you provided all we wished for.
- What was it necessary to kill off all those people with hunger? Not that I mind, but I’d like to know.
- It was necessary to provide the seed for the future plans, not for you to be concerned. Also, I have an enemy here that had to be shackled for me to come personally. The only way to do so is to bind him in great suffering, for he feels the pain of the land and its inhabitants. We tried the same with death camps but it proved inefficient. Then we thought it must’ve been because we brought people that weren’t his and tried this with you. Success, as you can see, is proven by my standing in front of you.
- What is it that you require next? I’m a busy man, and I have plans for my country. State your demands and they will be met.
- Of course, of course. We need you to provide constant conflict between Russia and the New world. To provide such conflict that will leave Europe weak until we need it to rise again.
- It can be done, easily. What do I get in return?
- You get to prosper, within your limits, and you get freedom from our interventions for as long as you are alive. Is it good enough?
- It is. Will you leave now?
- I will Joseph, and we shall never meet again. Thank you for your services.

2012, Belgrade, “Five skyscrapers”

As I entered the apartment I could immediately feel that something was amiss. Without even taking my shoes off, I went into the kitchen and saw Peter sitting at the table, lost for the world. Forest Mother wasn’t there, but her presence could be felt in the air. At least, I could feel it.
Peter stood up, with the glossy film on his eyes, looking at me without even seeing me. He held out his arms and took me in his embrace, totally unaware of the silence. As a robot, completely out of the body, he was warm, but not on fire.
I let him take me to the bedroom, where he slowly took off our clothing, in complete silence. He placed me on the bed and started kissing me patiently, starting from the lips, over the breasts, down to the shuddering belly and further south. He wasn’t there entirely, but my desire was too great not to respond to his touch. When I felt his beard on my inner tights, there was nothing more I could do but surrender.
After a time, an eternity as it seemed to me, he came up again, bringing my own fragrance back to me on his lips. My legs were already spread wide and I was all but ready to take him inside regardless of the force. At the time, his eyes were still murky and covered in fog, but as his body kept moving they became clearer and more focused.
As I felt his warmth spreading inside me, our gazes interlocked and I realized complete focus and connection. The energy flowed from his body, both from his eyes to mine and from that other part of us that was combined as one. The circle was complete, the deed was done, and we were as close to become one as we shall ever be.
At that moment I knew, anything before and anything after, all the troubles and all the suffering was worth it. We have created what we were created for.

1953, Vienna, St. Rupert’s Church

- Brothers, once again we meet in crisis. Our attempts at diminishing the power of the Eastern countries are at a brink. We did well with our friend, but now he’s dead and we face a problem.
- Reverend brother, we might be in trouble, but the solution is relatively easy, regardless of their leadership choice.
- What do you mean brother?
- I mean that we have a certain way of further undermining their economy, and by doing so, we can also keep our western problems at bay.
- Explain your words, and be thorough.
- Well, our mission is to make them use as much of their resources as possible. We do so by prolonging the cold war indefinitely, with careful choices and influences. For example, we assist the westerns in developing their technology but making it dependent on eastern contractors for parts. This will make them unable to produce anything important on their own, and the eastern shall be too busy producing parts to develop final products.
- And for how long? They are bound to attempt testing that technology. We could have a real war soon enough and we have tried that unsuccessfully twice!
- Yes, we did so, but I propose a different kind of war. I propose a war to conquest space and to make them compete in a meaningless run. At the same time, I also propose small battlefields across the world, in unimportant countries, just to allow them to test their armies.
- And what about our true goal? How do you propose to keep searching for the object we seek all along?
- By keeping that small country dependent on the western products, and bound to the East by former allegiances. In that way, we can freely search without raising suspicion. 
- Good proposal, very good indeed. See to it being put to action. And double the number of our agents all over Balkan. Some of the informants have sent their reports stating that the artifact is somewhere there.
- We will, reverend brother, as you say.
The Council dispersed once again, leaving their leader sitting alone on his chair. Like a spider in a giant web, a web covering the entire world.
Hoping for that big, fat fly to fall in, and luring it to the center of the web.

- What just happened?
I sat on the edge of the bed, watching Morana’s naked body sprawled next to me. Anything I experienced during the last half an hour was a blur. Of course, it was pretty obvious what we did, but my lack of memory was concerning.
- I’m not sure entirely, but I did like most of it.
Turning my head swiftly towards her face, I could see the smirk on her lips. She surely had some knowledge.  
- Well, it would be nice if I liked it also. Of course, for that, I would have to remember it.
Morana sat up, curling her legs under her, making me all but unable to think.
- Well, remember how I had to go to Montenegro during your visit to Hilandar?
- I do, does it have something to do with my mother visiting us here?
- Sort of, I had to perform something that would connect us even closer, something that would allow me to take an active part. And your mother did a similar thing to you here. 
- What? Render me unconscious?
- No, you fool! – Morana laughed – She made you whole human for a period. Loss of memory is just a collateral thing. At the same time, I was being myself again, just as I was when we first met.
- Why was that important? I mean, we could do what we just did anyway. There was no need to convert me to human and then make me not remember the deed!
-  I’m not certain, she tried to explain it, but finally gave up and just told me not to worry my little head with such a large ideas. So I gave up and complied.
Well, that sounded just like my mother. And I could almost grasp her sense of humor. It fitted her just fine, to drug me, to send Morana across the peninsula to another country and to create an event that complicates all just to make me worry. That was her kind of gameplay, confuse everybody and laugh at their confusion. Just like a child busting up an anthill and watching them run around aimlessly. 
But I could hear a tiny voice in my head softly making a remark. What if Morana just avoided telling me the whole truth?
We got married the next day.

Dark hooded apparition sat at the empty table. There was only his chair present, all other were removed from the room. For the first time in his memory, there was no Council.
And for the first time, other seven members survived their retirement from it. They were justly rewarded each with his or her domain, continuing to promote the same ideas openly and without being clandestine.
The Dragon was pleased. The world was behaving just as he had planned; his affairs and labors were finally producing fruit. That period of adjustment was over and there was no need for formal cold war. Just to think, all it needed was to remove the person holding Balkan states together and let them divide it themselves. Now his minions were not forced to hide while searching for the artifact, they just paid local workforce and waited for the result.
Surely, things were a bit slow, but he had time. After two millennia, he was not going to be impatient. What’re a couple more decades for the one who is immortal?

2012, Belgrade, Kalemegdan fortress

We sat on the bench in the Belgrade Zoo, watching the elephant trying to cross the concrete ditch and eating our cheese sandwiches. Looking like the true image of a young couple enjoying their stay at the Capital. For a fortnight now, we were exploring Belgrade underground with no success. Literally the underground, one that is truly dangerous. Not the criminal one. And, I might add, we had our fair share of unwanted encounters.
Mostly we met minor demons and half-life. The minor ones coming to greet us with awe, since they have never met half demons so strong whom didn’t wish to destroy them. The other ones just skidded toward shadows, never even attempting to check if we had anything against their existence.
At one point, things got a bit rough, since we stumbled upon another Ala, just like the one we met when both of us were new to this union and had little knowledge about our powers. Morana instantly shifted to her Between body, and I stepped up in front of the foe, to show what I am. Ala simply blinked and stated:
- Zduhach? What are you doing here? It has been more than two centuries since I’ve eaten my last human; I was allowed to live here in peace if I perform my duty!
- What do you mean by duty?
- First things first, are you here to kill me?
- No, I’m not, I have another quest; we stumbled upon your lair by mere accident. We’ve met one of your kind earlier, but it wished to end our lives.
- And killed him, I take it. Otherwise, you would not be here.
- Do you mind? – I said with a razor in my words.
- No, of course not. We are just mercenaries now, good old times have passed and people are too strong for us to do what we wish. I, myself, took upon a task to preserve this city from demon overflow and been doing it since the Turks left.
- How do you control their population?
- How do you think? I’m not allowed to eat a human, that was my promise, but I have to eat something!
- If we promise that you are not in danger from us, do we have your promise not to be in our way?
- Of course, furthermore, I’ll spread the word around that you should be helped if necessary.
We thanked it and left, treading carefully for the next few days. 
Today, we came up in horror, to regroup and think a bit. Our acquaintance has shown up again in our path. Dead. There aren’t many beings that can kill an old and experienced Ala. One of them is me, and Morana of course, but she doesn’t count since there has been nobody like her before and won’t be again. Since we didn’t do it, it was fairly obvious there was a bigger player in the game now.
By examining the wounds on him, we could count the slashes and stabs, and came upon the only one possible solution. We had a Bukavac in our city, a six-legged monster with gnarled horns and scaly skin. They usually lived near water and drowned cattle and people by night since any kind of light bothered them immensely.
Out in the open, they were able to draw a shadow above their lair and prevent sunshine, nothing of bother for me since I could disperse clouds and shadows by will alone, but down here in deep darkness…
As we pondered upon our future actions, there was a rustle behind us. We both jumped in surprise, turning around, and ready to fight. There was just a soft whimper and a wet nose pressed into my palm. Things were a bit lighter now. Aga was back.
- You rascal! Where were you all this time?
- Like you worried – Morana said – You knew he was OK, going about his own business! Come here boy; don’t waste your time on this man!
Aga just looked at me with a serious face and went towards Morana, opening his mouth and rolling his behind like a regular puppy. I was all but hurt with this display of brown-nose behavior.
- Traitor! I thought you were my dog!
Aga just snarled and laid flat in front of Morana with his front legs stretched up, cajoling her into scratching his ears and caressing his back. Suck up, if I ever saw one.
Anyway, I was happy about his return. Now we stood better chances to find our goal and to fight our foe. I was not really afraid of Bukavac, but such a thing could not be taken lightly.

Men in dark blue suits walked around all day. They were everywhere, and some of them were all around the kitchen. The chef was bothered by this intrusion since almost all of his underlings were shaking in fear and making mistakes. And he didn’t need this, he needed peace and quiet and he needed all meals to be made perfectly. He’s been told that somebody of great importance is coming to the meeting at the highest level and needs to be presented befitting his position.
And after the murder of the former prime minister, this was the first chance for the Chef to show his full potential. He usually cooked with the same quality, but nobody here could appreciate his art. They were simply satisfied with cheap and plentiful.  Ah, the former PM! That was a man who could recognize a good meal! Of course, being educated in foreign countries, his pallet was used to refined tastes.
- What are you doing there?
The policeman in civil clothes turned towards him with a frown.
- What do you mean?
- If you wish to keep your nose, please take it out of my assistant’s carrots! He’s so nervous; he’ll chop off his fingers!
- Mind your own business old man! I’m here to make sure the food is properly made!
- THAT is MY business! Get out of my kitchen before I call upon your Minister to sack you back to your village! He owes me a favor anyway for the extra cake at each lunch!
The policeman blinked and started moving away from the little cook. 
- But, I was born and raised in Belgrade. This is my village…
- Where?
- At Dorćol, not far from here…
- Then I’ll have you sent to the Zoo to be even closer to home!
- All right, all right, I’ll move. Just keep in mind that everything must be perfect for this guest.
- Don’t worry young man; it is my head if all is not perfect. I could lose a job and I’m too old to bake burgers. I’m sorry if I snapped too hard, but the pressure is too great…
- It’s OK, I’m used to it. Just don’t shout anymore, not all of us are from around here, some are from the villages you probably never heard of.
The young policeman walked away to the pantry, and the Chef winked towards his cook there. He nodded in understanding. A policeman is going to be served something he likes to eat or something he never tasted before. He’ll be satisfied and at ease for the rest of the day.
The relief was obvious all around. It took just a little display of power to show them who holds the reins here. The Chef was contented, these newts were small fries to him. He continued to prepare a special spice for the feast, his Master shall be pleased.


Chapter 50

Happiness is great but distracting. Be careful not to indulge it too much.
The Book of answers, vol. 21, chapter 12

2012, Belgrade, Kalemegdan fortress

The fun was great but we had a job to do. Once again we climbed down to the depths of the fortress, this time, preceded by Aga and his keen nose. His seriousness and attention were a welcome addition to our own as we stepped with more assurance than before.
At first, we just walked through the narrow corridors of the underground, barely making any sounds. Our torches were military grade, reliable and strong, but of little use in this maze of walls. Suddenly, the maze started to unravel, and we found ourselves in a large hall. Every wall was covered with graffiti but little was legible of it. I speak several languages, but there was not even one familiar phrase. The drawings, on the other hand, were quite familiar. Depictions of torture disemboweled bodies and creatures feasting upon them. I could recognize vampires, bauks, even werewolves. Others were beyond my knowledge; I’ve never been so unlucky as to meet them in person.
And all of them were drinking, eating or mutilating human bodies. It was a veritable shrine of monstrosity.
Aga and Morana turned towards me and I could see her face was pale in disgust. Aga came to me and gently pushed me to the center of this cathedral of evil. As I lowered my torch, I could see the stone under my feet. There it was the unmistakable signature of the artifact we were looking for – blackened square in the middle of the room. No wonder these graffiti were here – evil could sense its own.
But where it was now? Clearly it has been taken away. I looked towards Aga with this question in my mind and he reacted immediately. His nose pointed to the opposite side and, under the light, I could see a small opening in the rock, a door carved into the living stone.
- Should we go there? – I asked Aga. His only response was baring his teeth and a low growl.
- I see. But, we must, so we shall go with great care. Please watch and alert us if anything appears.
Aga eased forward and we followed. As I came to the door, there was a flicker of my torch and the light seemed to diminish a bit. That was odd; the batteries were supposed to be freshly charged and should last for at least few more hours.
- Do you feel this Morana?
- If you mean the gathering darkness, I do.
- What do you mean by gathering darkness?
- Turn around.
I did. The room behind was totally immersed in oily black, you could almost feel it filling up inside. I turned my torch, but the spot of the light stopped just a couple of meters far. This could mean only one thing, well; it could mean a few in other places but here, after what we saw in dead Ala’s wounds it could mean only one.
- Be careful, Bukavac is near.
- Not just near young Zduhach. I’m right behind you.


Chapter 51

Money always finds a way. First you must deprive a person of it, then, when you come with the offer, he’ll accept anything you decide to give. Such is the order among the unfaithful.
The Book of answers, vol. 21, chapter 8

2008, Belgrade, undisclosed location

- Just do as I told you. You saw that I deliver on my promises. You have a major European festival here.
- Yes, we believe you, but our people are restless. We think they might object.
- Why would they? You’ll get more money and worldwide games. Just keep them interested and they’ll be happy.
- But the elections are barely over and we have the majority. I fear we might lose it if we agree to their demands.
- It is bound to happen. The world will recognize their right to be independent just as it has recognized other countries. You just need to keep the people calm for the next few years and they’ll come to accept the status.
- All right sir, as you say, but it will take a lot of money to keep them calm.
- Don’t worry, you’ll get as much as you need. I promise you that if you behave. Otherwise, expect my support to go elsewhere. You are just as expendable as any other politician.
- We’ll behave. Don’t worry.
The man in a gray suit picked up his briefcase and stood up. He was satisfied how things were going here. Of course, he is going to check up with his master about the following events, but so far all was in his favor. 
His escort waited for him in the limousine hired just for the visit to this country. As he stepped in, his last thought was how this country can produce such a good-looking women and such a stubborn people. Just a second before his escort sprouted claws and wolf snout while jumping at his throat.
The driver turned a knob and thick black glass rose between him and the carnage on the back seat. The reverend one will be pleased. There will be no tracks of this meeting.


Chapter 52

Fear kills the thought. Don’t let it do so, sometimes the only thing between victory and defeat is a simple sharp idea.
The Book of answers, vol. 21, chapter 12

2012, Belgrade, labyrinth under Kalemegdan

Funny. I’ve been in mortal danger before, and it would be a lie to say that there was no fear. In fact, most of the time, in such situations, I’m just horrified with it. Interesting enough, that fear catalyses me into action and lets me use my innate abilities without even thinking about them.
In this case, there was no fear. I was stone cold and freakishly calm. That was good, actually, because Bukavac can be persuaded to talk with the potential victim if there is no water in the vicinity. Its favorite method of killing was by drowning, but in other circumstances it liked to assess the victim’s abilities before engaging in battle. And this one was wise; it was able to outsmart an old and experienced Ala. I just hoped it was also vain, old beings often are.
- Well, it seems that you know about me. Thank you for calling me young, but I’m at my forties now.
- Not even a half of century? That is merely a quarter in the life of a Zduhach. Pity, you should’ve stayed away. Now you’ll just die for no good reason.
- I beg to differ, my life is my own and I won’t give it up easily. You are strong and mighty, but we may yet prove to be a tough bite.
- A maiden, a dog and you? When I finish you and the mutt, I may even keep the maiden to scratch my scales when I’m resting. I know your powers, but we are too deep for you to use the best ones. The Sun doesn’t shine here. And in combat, we both know who is stronger. No, young Zduhach, I’m afraid this is your last fight.
- Surely we could make an arrangement? I’ll let you go if you let me go?
- Normally, in different circumstances, I’d accept. But I know why you are here, and I’ve been sent to find the same thing you are looking for. There can be no truce, one of us must die. That means you, of course.
I turned towards it for the first time, slowly, but there was almost nothing to see. The beast was black in deep darkness, and there was only one way for me to see it. I switched Between and there it was. Massive and ugly thing, covered with formidable scars all over its scaly body. Gnarly horns and six legs were encrusted in iron, and its eyes were just small pools of black fluid, like spiders eyes, only less of them.
His mouth stretched in something resembling a smile. If you could imagine a shark smiling towards an unsuspecting surfer while he’s off his board.
- Ah, young Zduhach, you wish to see me better while we fight. I can respect that, but this is not the true light and it cannot hurt me, you just see me with your mind.
- Naturally, I just wished to admire your posture for a bit, before we kill you.
- We? You don’t mean you and the dog? He can’t even cross here!
Morana, who was silent through the entire conversation, understood what must be done here and shifted Between at that point. Oh, poor Bukavac, I could almost feel for it.
- No, beast, he means him and me. There is no light here but the one we carry inside us, and I carry a lot. Now I’m going to scratch your head with it!
She unfolded her wings and sprouted talons on her feet and hands, tearing up the shoes and clothes. At the same time, her skin started glowing with Dragon lord fire, stronger and stronger each second. I could see the beast cowering in terror as it realized what she was and where does this murdering light come from.
- Stop! Please! I would’ve never have touched you had I known who’s in your company!
- Oh, but just a second ago you were sure that I’m going to die. And now this fair maiden is about to sear you like an egg.
- I had no choice! I had no choice! He said he’ll burn me with his fire! He never said that you have it too!
- I have no fire to use as a weapon; all of it belongs to my companion. What do you mean HE said? Your employer?
- My jailor, my blackmailer, my master. Dragon lord of Europe! I was supposed to come here and find the thing, and kill you if I can. Since the Ala he has sent after you failed, I was the next reasonable choice. But he never said you carry a Sun with you!
- Such a shame, I’ll make sure to tell him your last words before I kill him.
I almost felt sorry for the beast; its skin was blistering and melting under Morana’s light, ugly and twisted horns crumbled into dust, until only the iron covering of the legs remained in the puddle that was rapidly evaporating. Almost.
We turned back to normal world, and suddenly there was no darkness in the room. Our torches shined just as they were meant to, and Aga was waiting patiently. I looked into Morana’s eyes and we burst into uncontrollable laughter. All was well for now.


Chapter 53

If a pawn fails, you must send a knight or a bishop, if they fail, you must send a rook. If even a rook fails, then a queen is in order.
The Book of answers, vol. 21, chapter 12

2012, Vienna, St. Rupert’s Church

- I’ve made the room dark enough for you, don’t try to gather more darkness.
- I wouldn’t even try, master.
Of course it would, and it tried to do so, but there is no way to escape the will of a Dragon lord. The beast could only stay where it was and wait for the orders. As powerful and strong as it was, it could stand no more against him than a candle could stay lit in a hurricane.
- Yes, you would. But I won’t take it against you. After all, it is your nature. I’m just stating the obvious – you don’t need to in my presence. There is no way to hide, and no way to defeat me.
To emphasize the words, the Dragon lord heightened his glow for a moment. The beast cringed and closed its eyes. Then the light dissipated and the room was mercifully dark again.
- Thank you my Lord, you are kind to me. How may I serve you?
- My foe has risen again. He was lost for the last nine years, and I thought he was surely dead or inactive. But, as it turns out, one of my brethren only hid him from my sight for a while. I’ve put these years to a good use, and shaped the structure of the government in the country of my interest as I needed, and my search is almost complete, but he could thwart my plans with ease. I need you to go there and destroy him, and find me the artifact I spoke about earlier.
- But master, is he so powerful that you must send me? Surely there is another of your servants that can do this just as I can? I mean no disrespect of course, just wish to be prepared better.
- I’ve sent an Ala after him, and he managed to kill it. He is a powerful Zduhach, and I have no time to check just how powerful. Go there, wait for him in the dark where he can expect no help from the Sun and finish him off. First kill him and then look for the artifact.
- I will master, and I’ll do it gladly. 
- If you do so, I’ll grant you all the waters of that country, there will be no contender to challenge you.
- Thank you, a kind and great reward. I’ll do my best to deserve it.
The beast slithered across the floor on its six legs, dragging its belly over the stone floor, while the iron shroud of them clinked and scratched.
The Dragon remained in silence, he was sure that this thing can subdue the Zduhach, and that his quest is at an end. So close he could almost taste the power waiting for him. 


Chapter 54

Walk carefully, watch around you or you’ll miss the clues. If you do, help might find you in unexpected places.
The Book of answers, vol. 21, chapter 12

2012, Belgrade, labyrinth under Kalemegdan

Aga was tracking in front of us, and we could sense that he had picked up a trail. There was no telling what kind of the trail he was following, but it was pretty obvious that he had one.
We turned and twisted through the maze, couple of times finding several doors in the same hallway, but Aga was sure in choosing the way. I held sincere hope he’ll be sure in getting us out of here.
Deeper and deeper we went, I began worrying if our torches would last long enough. Morana walked in silence, there was something heavy on her mind.
- We should stop and rest for a while, I’m getting a bit tired.
- I don’t need to rest – Morana said – I just wish to find the artifact.
- We’ll get nowhere like this. If there is more danger ahead we should be rested.
- All right, let’s stop for a minute.
We sat down and I handed her a bottle of water and a sandwich. Aga came to me, sniffed the sandwich and smirked at me, but accepted some water.
- I’m sorry buddy, no meat or bones for you, we didn’t expect you here.
He just opened his jaw in a yawn, stretching his tongue like I large pink slide. I could see each and every one of his ivory teeth and felt happy that he is at my side and not against me. He turned and wondered off into an empty hallway,
- Peter, do you think we’re close?
- I don’t know, we could find it behind the next corner or not at all. Perhaps we’ll even have to come back another day. Is there something else on your mind?
- Well, there is this thing I wanted to tell you, but…
At that point Aga rushed back in and grabbed my wrist in his mouth. I stood up and he gently dragged me forward. Morana followed behind us as I entered the corridor and, after only several steps, stumbled forward.
The hall we entered was a bit lower than the corridor, and I was going too fast to notice. When I picked myself up from the floor, There was light in the room and there was a box in the middle of it. Strangely familiar box. So familiar, I started to laugh.
- Isn’t that… - Morana started the sentence
- Yeah, it’s the frigging Ark of the Covenant! But, this one is obviously some Goth production, or someone peeled the gold off of it. I feel just like Indiana, only slightly annoyed!
The box looked like the movie prop from the Raiders of the Lost Ark. Rectangular box with a couple of angels on top of it, shielding the content. Four rings, one on each side, and wooden poles stuck through them. The difference being just what I mentioned – it was not gilded and shiny, it was plain dark wood. Well, something like wood, because it seemed to be alive in some strange way. Not really alive, more like undead, a zombie of the box.
- It feels almost alive – Morana said – I can sense it watching us…
- I feel it too, as if it wishes me to touch it, to open the lid…
- It would be unwise, Peter.
Man! This day just kept getting better and better! First that beast crept up to me, now there was God knows what horror in the same room with me, and my dog never sounded a word in both cases! Well, to be honest, the first time is justified; it’s not easy to notice a Bukavac approaching if it doesn’t wish to be noticed. But now we were in a well-lit room, for crying out loud! My hearth made a zealous attempt to burst out of my chest like a movie Alien.
Wait a second; Aga must’ve sensed this, so it must’ve been somebody familiar. Or, at least, it was not a foe.
- Ah, you finally started thinking. Good, very good…
- You know, I’d call you an idiot, but it seems a bit unwise to call an angel that name.
- Unwise and untrue, yes. Nevertheless, I truly enjoyed your line of thinking while you were coming up to the conclusion.
- Yeah, waiting for me to drop of heart attack! 
- You were immersed in the spell of the artifact. Morana and Aga felt and saw me the moment I appeared. Isn’t that right my child?
- Of course, Stefan, there was no doubt as to who was coming.
Morana was playing with Aga in the corner, like a little girl with her puppy. The blasted dog was enjoying himself far too much, I tell you.
- Wait just a jiffy, you scared me too much to ask, what are you doing here?
- I’m always here. It’s my duty.
- And when we met before? You weren’t here then!
- Of course I was here; the fact of our meeting doesn’t collide with my being here.
- You mean to say… oh!
I must’ve looked really stupid with my mouth hanging down. I could swear Stefan’s lips curved in a smile, Morana was laughing her pretty ass of, and that traitor with a tail was rolling on his back.
This was Stefan’s true body, what I met before was just a projection of it. I was in the presence of the real, flesh and bone, bona fide, certified angel. Awesome.
- Then what’s with all this chasing me around? You could’ve just said the artifact was here and I would come to pick it up!
- No, I couldn’t. Our common enemy has many hand and eyes looking for this place. It was necessary for you to distract them and send them on a wild goose chase. That and something else.
He turned his gaze on Morana and I saw her nod in confirmation.
- It has been done.
- What has been done?
- What I was trying to tell you in the corridor when Aga interrupted us. You’re going to become a father, Peter.

2012, Belgrade, grand apartment hotel Jugoslavija

The Dragon lord knew his beast would fail. Good thing he was prepared for this moment and came to Belgrade himself. For the last few days, he was receiving visits from his minions strategically inserted on all levels of government.
They were carefully selected and placed as secretaries, lawyers, advisors and personal assistants to the most powerful leaders of all political parties. None of them was in the open, none known to general public, but all in positions to know everybody and influence everything.
Now they were all arriving to report on the events. So far, things were under control, the police was given a description of that man who was the only one able to thwart Dragon’s plan and they were secretly searching for him. Furthermore, the criminal leaders were also alerted to a large reward for the capture of that same person. Effectively, the entire city was searching for him. If he surfaces anywhere, they’ll bring him to the Dragon.
Some worries still remained. The underworld and its inhabitants were refusing to participate, and he couldn’t coerce them to change their mind. If he did so, any one of them could alert his brother and that would be the end. He didn’t mind subtle attempts and small influences, but such a large display of power would certainly bring him to the open conflict. And in that battle, on his ground, he would surely win. Fortunately, that battle would kill many mortals here, and he was not prepared to let that happen unless absolutely necessary.
If only he could find this Peter soon, before he finds the artifact and carries it away again. He was born for that duty and it could not escape him unless he was prevented to do so.
The door opened and a young waiter came in with some food and drinks on the trolley. Behind him, dressed in deep blue suit, was a person Dragon held the most faith in.
- My lord, I’ve come to give you the good news.
- Just a second, my friend. Young man, leave the trays on the table. There is also something for you, do be kind and make sure we are not disturbed here.
- Of course, sir. – The waiter said – I’ll stay in the corridor and stop any new arrivals.
Of course he will. The tip at the table was sufficient for him to buy a small car. The Dragon would have left more, money meant nothing to him, but he was aware that larger tips would rose suspicion. It was one thing to be generous eccentric, and quite another to burn money. For a larger sum, a young waiter would suspect some kind of foul play. Not that it would mean anything, but publicity was not wanted here. As he left, the Dragon turned towards his guest.
- What is the news?
- Peter was spotted in the Zoo, accompanied with a young lady. Our contacts tell us it was his wife, they married few days ago. They went under the fort, into a labyrinth using an entrance nobody was supposed to know of, closed for general public.
Yes, they did. And Peter was close to the artifact. Time was of essence now. Dragon stood up and walked towards his servant.
- We must hurry. Take me there immediately.


Chapter 56

For several minutes I was just standing there being ridiculous. I was going to be a father? Me? Emotions whirled inside me like a merry-go-round, never stopping for a second. I had to thake a deep breath and swallow before I could even speak a word. And my mouth felt suddenly full of cotton.
- How? Why? When? – I started and then my mind was free again.
- All right, I can understand when and how, obviously, I’m not that stupid. But doesn’t the timing seem a bit strange? I mean, we are in the middle of war!
- Well, my dear, we are married now, and that’s what married people do.
I turned my eyes from Stefan to Morana. She was smiling, and there was a definite laughter hidden behind that smile. Aga was sitting on his ass with his head tilted to the side, clearly enjoying my confusion. Ah, that’s how this is going to be played.
- I know, dammit! But I thought it’s going to be just a tad slower! First we finish this business, and then we go on a nice vacation, set up our flat and think about children!
- Don’t be alarmed Peter, we had it foreseen. Your mother, Dragon lord and I combined our visions and they all show a great chance this task might fail. Knowing that our nemesis won’t leave you alive, we had to make sure the bloodline shall prevail.
Mother dear, I knew it! That’s why she was out of the woods, literally. I remembered one other thing also.
- But what did she have to drug me for? I would’ve complied gladly anyway!
- Part of the solution. When Morana went to Podgorica there was a reason for it. Being what she is prevented her from getting pregnant and the only person who could do something about it lives there. The other part of the solution was that your conscience had to be muffled; you had to be willing yet unaware. Otherwise the part of you that is the connection to the bloodline would transfer to the unborn child and you’d become unable to complete this task. This future child is just a regular human; it shall receive the power only after your demise. If ever.
- That’s good to know, one more thing…
- No more, time is getting short; I can sense evil forces searching for you even now. We must hurry.
- All right, but this chat isn’t over, you know!
- Let me tell you a story, one that will explain everything. Now you can hear it and finish this job.
- Won’t we lose too much time?
- Not at all my child, time is just an illusion, easily controlled like any other. My story will be long, but we won’t spend any time on it.
And then the Angel started his tale.

Two well dressed men walked slowly through the crowd. It was weekend, and a very nice weather, so people visited the Zoo gladly. One of them was a bit annoyed with the fact that they had to behave as any normal visitor, but the other had assured him to do so. It was imperative not to draw any attention, and people would notice somebody rushing with no apparent reason through the Zoo.
- Sir, I thought you said we must hurry?
- I did, but to be fast isn’t the same as to be foolish. We must take caution until we’re underground.
- Don’t we need a map?
- Not really, I was here when the fort was built, I know all the ways under it. Just follow me until we reach the entrance. Then you’re free to go back and wait for my return.
- Won’t you need my assistance?
- Of course not. I just need you to walk with me here to provide cover should we meet any authorities. I’m in no danger from them, but it’s a lot easier if a local man discusses any issues. 
With this conversation, they slowly reached the small entrance. It looked totally inconspicuous, if you didn’t know where it led, you’d never guess it.

2012, Belgrade, labyrinth under Kalemegdan

Once before the time, there were loose forces in action. They were all powerful and worked as one in making the planet a good place to live on. Not for the humans, or any other animal in particular, just a place to uphold life in any appearance.
Any living planet has such forces in action. If they leave or get destroyed, the planet dies. Not over night, but over centuries, yet it surely dies.
These forces here had no names. They were the same and all as one. And there was the land and there was the ocean; one large land and one vast ocean. They divided the land into divisions and worked as well as they could each on his part. They were immortal and never got tired, never got bored and never stopped. Once they completed the act, it was time for life to appear. And it did. Slowly at first, with much help and care, they watched it thrive and blossom. And it was all good.
One of them looked upon the lands of his brethren and saw them full of plants and animals, but his own was barren and empty. There was no reason for it because he took the same effort in building as did his brethren. And, for the first time since they were made to exist, he had a feeling other than absolute joy. He felt jealous of his brothers. At his anger, he used most of his powers and broke the land to pieces. The other forces were taken by surprise, but when they saw who was responsible, they decided to capture and stop him. Since he was immortal, they used their power to push his part of the land far to the south, and since it was already lifeless they made an icy prison of it. In that prison they tied their brother to stay isolated forever.
For long, the other six brethren worked again to better their lands, failing and trying again, until everything was well again. They thought nothing of the seventh one, and he appeared no more. Then one decided he was needed no more and there has been enough work on his side. So he rested and stopped taking care of his realm. His people called for him for centuries until they gave up.
The other one finished his work and fell to sleep, leaving his people to tend for them. They dreamed about him and about the time when he shall wake again, but his sleep was too deep for their voices.
A third and a fourth, the young twins, took one-half of the single realm each and held them as they wished, taking small if any role in the affairs of other brothers.
The fifth and the sixth held their part of the burden with a heavy hand, thinking of the past, present and future at the same time. Making their lands grow and prosper.
The seventh one watched over them with a jealous eye, for his land was cold and dark, and that cold and darkness crept upon his soul, and his heart became as the land he held - frozen and hard, lifeless. 
In his fort under the frozen mountains, he decided to take the prosperous lands of his brethren and make them his own. It took him millennia, but at the end, he held the realms of the sleeping brethren, prolonging their sleep and keeping them from hearing their people. 
He coerced the twins to work on his behalf, they thought it was the best for all, and he took a foothold on the fifth brother's land. In doing so, already weakened from his former wrath, he knew there was no way for him to defeat the two brethren that were still active. So he searched and searched and finally found what he needed.

- What did he find? – I asked.
- He found about this box. It has been a matter of many legends among humans, and it took him some time to gather the real information, but he did in time.
- What is so important about a simple box?
- It may look simple, but it is not. You know about the three plains of existence? The one we’re in right now, the one where my race exists and the one opposite to mine?
- Yeah, anybody knows it, the Earth, the Heaven, the Hell. There is also Between, where magical creatures live. 
- There is, because we all need some neutral ground intersecting. Each of the realms can enter Between, but never pass directly from one to another. Some creatures may be allowed to pass from one to another if the Lord of the land approves. That’s the way I came here, your Dragon lord allowed me to pass providing that I remain bound to this box protecting it.
- Why?
- Because you were given free will. You can choose whether to be evil or good. Either way, each of our realms provided something to help you when you choose. I was sent to give advice and assistance, and this thing was sent to provide sheer darkness and power. It looks alive, but it is, in fact, total negation of life.
- But, why didn’t the seventh brother use the same link and provide pass for the forces of evil on his land?
- That’s not his intention. He wants this box just to absorb its power. It is the only way for him to destroy his brothers and rule the entire world.
- So, what would happen if I open the box?
- You would get very powerful, godlike, but corrupted and evil. The world would be open for the Dark ones to come freely, and they would make a playground of it.
- But that’s not going to happen since I finally found it. Now, please, step aside and let me consume it.
The voice belonged to a tall person behind Stefan. It suddenly appeared as if materialized out of thin air. It was vaguely humanoid, only totally dark and shadowy, just an outline filled with black.
It was the rogue Dragon, the one we sought to avoid.


Chapter 60

And each beginning leads to an end.
The Book of answers, vol. 21, chapter 12

2012, Belgrade, labyrinth under Kalemegdan

We simply froze. Morana and Aga were just sitting between me and the box, Stefan turned slowly towards the Dragon and I shifted to Between without even thinking about it.
It was like looking into a sun orbiting a black hole. Stefan was shining bright and warm, and the Dragon was a humanoid mass constructed of living darkness. If a color could be called alive this black would be so. He seemed as if constructed of black water in turmoil, as if small tornadoes were whirling inside his shape, reaching in each direction but mostly at Stefan. I watched in awe and horror as Stefan spoke to the Dragon.
- You know, old one, that I cannot be involved physically.
- I know, and I expect you to honor that obligation. My goal is the box and the power within. If you don’t stand in my way, you can freely go back to your realm.
For a moment, I saw the expression of nostalgia on Stefan’s face. God only knows for how long he has been a prisoner of his duty. I could almost taste his desire to be free and go back home. Something I could relate to. At the same time, I hoped for him to stay. 
- Same thing goes for you, children. I feel merciful today, should you decide to leave without fight, I’ll let you live.
- For how long, you monster? – I asked.
- There, there, child. No need for such harsh words. It shall take me centuries to find my brothers and absorb them all. You and your mate could live out your lives in peace.
- And what about our world?
- It shall remain more or less the same, of course, all shall bow to me. Stay quiet and I might just forget about you long enough.
Interesting offer, I must admit. We still had many years to enjoy each other and it would be a shame not to use them. I glanced toward Morana and saw pure anger in her eyes, shear wrath and resentment. Yeah, good point, what about our child? It deserves to live in a world without such evil as the Dragon is. I turned back to him prepared to give my answer, but he already knew it.
- Let it be so, you insolent child. Now you die.
The Dragon hurled his arm towards me. Not a weapon, for he had none, but his actual hand. In uncoiled like bunch of snakes reaching for my chest. Stefan, who was standing quietly while I spoke to the Dragon, stepped aside and deflected the attack while moving.
- You said you won’t involve!
- I didn’t, old one, I merely moved out of your way.
I couldn’t see his eyes, but they would surely be red with anger. He just waved his hand and Stefan fell over. I could see his light darkening and fading while the whips of dark light mauled his body. Without hesitation, I spread my arms and the wings under them readily moved back to give me more balance. My muscles rippled as if on their own will and I prepared to jump straight on his face.
Morana shrieked behind me and jumped before I had a chance to do so. Clearly, the Dragon hadn’t expect that attack since she was all over him, clawing his face with her hands and ripping off the matter of his chest with the talons on her legs. It was dropping of him like thick oil, evaporating upon touching the ground. For a second, I could feel his pain and a joyful thought entered my mind. I thought Morana was actually winning at this battle and hurried to assist her in finishing him off.
And then he just waved his arms, dismissing her to the dust as if she was nothing more than an insect. An annoying fly to be swatted with a rolled-up newspaper.
She fell heavily to the stones, not far from Stefan, and the way was just clear for the Dragon to reach me. At that point, I was sure my strength was nothing compared to his. While this thought entered my mind, something else also spoke inside it. The box. The box was full of power, I could clearly recall Stefan’s words as if freshly spoken “You would get very powerful, godlike.” There was something else too, but this was only important part. I jumped with all my strength. The Dragon must’ve thought I was about to attack him and he raised his arms in defense, but I had another thing in mind. The box was in my grasp faster then I imagined and I grabbed the heads of the wooden angels, lifting them separate to the right and left. The lid opened, and I stood above it with my arms spread wide while my eyes turned towards the content of the box.
There was nothing inside. It was completely empty.
Behind me, I could hear both Stefan and the Dragon screaming at me, but that was not important. I looked at my hands holding the heads of the wooden angels. Only, they were not holding wood. Instead, the wood of the box was flowing up my flesh, covering my body entirely. I could still think, I could still feel that I’m the same inside, but my body was now completely encased in this mysterious wood that was not really wood.
I was armored.
The Dragon rushed in one fluid motion towards me, only to be acquainted with my fist. He tried bursting flames at me, but they just turned to nothing as they touched me. I was powerful. I was omnipotent. I was the most important one. And, if I am all that, then this annoying little creature should not exist. I erased him from existence with a single thought.
My laughter was frightening.
- Peter…
It was Morana, she was alive!
- Peter, my love, what have you done?
I tried to tell her nothing was wrong. I tried to say how good this feels, but the words were not there. Instead, my arms lifted on their own and, with dread in my mind I knew the armor on my skin is about to kill her. And there was nothing I could do to prevent it.
With a corner of my eye, I saw Aga jumping at my throat, I could simply deflect him midair with a single thought, but Stefan lifted his arm and light flowed to the point where Aga will be in a moment. At the same time, similar light lifted off Morana’s body and flew to the dog. His fur started sparkling blue light while his body accelerated to the point where I couldn't distinguish any separate body part: he became a projectile. I watched this entire exchange completely frozen, as if my armor couldn’t decide what to do. Until Aga’s body slammed into mine with all his might.
My armor shattered and evaporated, and so did the dog. And all turned black for me.
When I woke up, my head was in Morana’s lap and she was crying, I could feel her tears touching my forehead.
- What happened?
- We beat the Dragon.
- And the box?
- It disappeared.
- What about Aga?
- He exists no longer. Stefan will explain to you.
- Peter, I gave my power to Aga, and so did Morana. We are merely human now. The box couldn’t remain here if there is no angel to counter it, so it immediately shifted back to its realm. We are free of evil.
- And what about us?
- Morana and I shall continue, I’ll go to the monastery where you first met me and continue my life as any other human. Hopefully, when I die, my soul shall find its way to my homeworld. She’ll go to her grandmother, they will keep her safe for all eternity, if need be.
- And I?
Morana started crying even harder and Stefan looked at me sadly. I knew the answer. For me, this was the end.
- Could you please give us a moment? – I asked Stefan
- Of course. Say your goodbyes.
He left us and I looked upon Morana’s eyes. God, she was beautiful.
- Goodbye, my love. We had our moments. Don’t be sad, after all, we are heroes and the world is safe.
- I’d give it up in exchange for you.
- We had our moments, Who would've known this just a few months ago? I'm happy that we had a chance for love.
She just kissed my lips silently and I died.


Chapter 61

And the circle never breaks.
The Book of answers, endnote

2013, A village, somewhere near Sokobanja

Young woman was standing in front of the gate. It was made of gold and silver, ornate intricately with small images and pictograms. It was closed, but she knew it will open for her. She knocked three times and it did.
A noble looking gatekeeper appeared, ushering her towards the throne room of the Dragon lord. He gazed upon her and asked about the events of her journey. After she finished the tale, including the fast paced events in the final battle ending in Peter’s death, he asked.
- What happened after he died?
- Well, everything diminished in a way. The room became smaller; any trace of the evil Dragon and the box disappeared, Stefan and I were left standing there above Peter. Suddenly, his body glowed and a ball of fire came out of it. The body just burned to ash, while the ball floated towards me and entered mine. It felt almost like the moment when you gave me the power, only I don’t feel it now.
- That’s because you have no more power. You are still what you are, but that part of Dragon’s fire doesn’t belong to you.
- To whom does it belong then?
- To Peter, should you decide to give him that name again. Now you must carry our hopes as Forest Mother did before you.
And he pointed towards her rounded belly shielded by her hands.

About the author: 

Radoslav B. Chugaly (a good query at google or any other net browser) - brick mason, carpenter, tile layer, concrete worker, poet, writer, performance artist, Dudeist, graduated as Bachelor with honors in economics. He is currently working as an accountant at public elementary school in Serbia. These are dry facts.
I'd like to use this opportunity to address you personally, my reader. This book is loosely based on real events from the history of Balkan Peninsula, more strongly on the Serbian mythology. It may not be so good; you might think it to be weak and/or poorly written. Please forgive me; English is not my native language, not even the first foreign language I learned. This book is my first novel, written directly in English, just for one purpose. I have a wish to break free as an artist, to stay independent from day job and create my own woodworking shop. Since I don't believe in asking for charity if one is healthy enough to earn, I've decided to write this novel and make my dream true. Quid pro quo.
Thank you for purchasing this novel, for a price of one cup of mocha you have made my dream a step closer. If you are ever in Serbia, don't hesitate to find me. I'll make you a cup of coffee in a manner native to my country.
