Chapter 1: Revealing Past

*Ridley and Sofia stood inside a cave and stared at a divine, rainbow-coloured shield, watching the aura dance with calm faces.*

Sofia: "Valhalla.." *She spoke under her breath, listening to the faint sounds of waves crashing outside.*

Ridley: "Sofia-"

Sofia: *She snapped out of her daze, facing Ridley with a smirk.* "So, this is where you did it?"

Ridley: *He nodded his head, as images of his confrontation with Pepper flashed in his head.* "Yes."

Sofia: (Game over to her.) *She licked her lips, smirking in an evil-like manner.* "So-?"

*Ridley walked towards the aura, causing Sofia to gasp in confusion.*

Sofia: "What are you doing? It'll burn you!-" *She stepped forward, shouting in an echoing voice.*

Ridley: *He reached forward and the aura instantly burnt his hand, violently pushing his arm back.* "Argh-"

Sofia: *She ran up to Ridley and glanced at the burns, looking at him in concern.* "What was that about?"

Ridley: *He shook his head and lifted his hand to his face, watching burnt skin flake off his fingers.* "The light is absolutely beautiful, yet completely unforgiving-"

Sofia: *She looked across his face, causing her to pout in response.* (He's upset-)

Ridley: "All because of my elemental affinity."

Sofia: *She gently grabbed his hand and closed her eye.* "Quick internal light, INVOKING AURA"

Ridley: *He paused with widening eyes, watching warm light heal his burns.* "S-Sofia.." *He mumbled to himself in shock, as the light dimmed with the Rostical.*

Sofia: *She opened her eyes and stepped back, looking at the aura in the corner of her eyes.* "The raw Radiatons won't let you in."

Ridley: "Right.." *He looked at his hand, staring at it in a memorised-like manner.* (Wow, only Gabby treated me like this, as an equal, nothing more, nothing less-)

Sofia: *She bent forward, looking at Ridley in confusion.* "Has something happened?"

Ridley: *He shook his head, lowering his hand with a smile.* "Sofia, come with me."

Sofia: "Huh?"

Ridley: "There's something I want to show you." *He glanced at the aura and turned around, starting to walk down the dark cave.*

Sofia: "Arh? Yeah sure." *She grunted in confusion and stared at his back, watching his body suddenly puff into a cloud of smoke.* "Wait!-" *She enthusiastically leant forward and flashstepped, causing dirt to spiral in the air.*

--

Ridley: *He suddenly appeared in front of a wide cave, waving smoke out of his face.* "I feel like I can trust you." *He spoke in a serious tone, stepping into the cave.*

Sofia: *She appeared behind Ridley outside the cave, looking slightly flustered and confused.* (That was a long flashstep.) *She hissed in thought, observing the outside of the cave.*

Ridley: "The seal deteriorated."

Sofia: *She focused her attention on Ridley's dark figure, slowly taking a step towards him.* (Going inside another cave-?)

Ridley: "I think it's time." *He mumbled to himself, sounding lost in thought.*

Sofia: "What is this abnormal behaviour, Ridley?"

Ridley: "This is where it all started from." *He looked up with determination, suddenly walking forward in an urgent manner.*

Sofia: (What did he mean that he can trust me? Didn't he before-?)

Ridley: "Sofia." *His voice echoed from down the cave, catching her attention.*

Sofia: *Her silver eyes shined in the poorly lit cave, as she stepped inside it.* "..."

Ridley: "Sofia?"

Sofia: "I'm here-" *She flashstepped and appeared by his side, looking at him with a confused smirk.*

Ridley: *He walked towards the end of the cave and stopped, rubbing the rocky wall in thought.* (The seals burnt out.)

Sofia: "What was here?"

Ridley: "Something happened and triggered his awakening.."

Sofia: *She observed the area, noticing black charcoal-like markings on the walls, ground and roof.* "I don't recognise these symbols or any of these glyphs." *She sounded unsure, looking up and down in a curious manner.*

Ridley: "They were all forbidden-" *He noticed a black ring on the ground and walked towards the middle of the area, stepping inside the ring.*

Sofia: (Forbidden? There're dozens of glyphic remains-)

Ridley: "You're the second person I've ever taken here."

Sofia: "Second?"

Ridley: "I took Zayden here."

Sofia: (The third seat captain.) *She stepped forward, causing small rocks to scrape under her foot.*

Ridley: *He sat down and crossed his legs, glancing at Sofia.* "My best friend and I found out how to make our dream come true." *He stared at the ground and reached out, rubbing the black markings.*

Sofia: (Huh?) *She paused, looked down at Ridley in confusion.*

--

*Gabriel and Riddle sat inside a well lit, dungeon-like room, deep in conversation.*

Gabriel: *He sat on a high wooden chair, kicking his legs in a happy manner.* "That Raphael man was amazing!"

Riddle: *He sat on a stool, leaning against the wall.* "I know!" *He looked at Gabriel in recollection, chuckling in disbelief.*

Ridley: "Although it had been three months since encountering Raphael, I still remember it as if it were three days ago."

Gabriel: "Ridz, I know you're naturally talented at everything, but even your powers were out of his league."

Riddle: "You're not wrong, Gabby." *He smiled, looking up to the ceiling in wonder.*

Gabriel: "So, before Raphael left us, he blurted out something about Radiatons being stronger than Neurons and Astragons."

Riddle: *He nodded his head and stood up, walking across the room.* "Did you know..?" *He frowned in thought, picking up a long, ruler-like stick which rested against the stone wall.*

Gabriel: "No, what?" *He slightly smirked with annoyance, staring at Riddle with anticipation.*

Riddle: "Having such power could help achieve our goal?" *He waved the wooden stick, glancing at Gabriel.*

Gabriel: "The power of light, a whole new affinity." *He leant back, adjusting the glasses on his face.*

Riddle: "Speaking about affinities, do you remember my experiment?" *He took several steps to the side and placed the ruler-like stick on a large whiteboard which hung off the wall.*

Gabriel: "Your choosing of the elements? So what did you decide to pick as your element? Ground or lightning?"

Riddle: "Oh, Gabby. You remembered." *He paused, looking at Gabriel with a smile.*

Gabriel: "Of course!"

Riddle: "Well, I want to show you."

Gabriel: "Show me? Here-?"

Riddle: "Hmm?" *He scanned across several long tables with laboratory-like items on them, focusing his attention to a Rosterology console.*

Gabriel: *He looked over to where Riddle stared at, gasping in response.* "N-No-" *He leant up, shaking his head.* "Not my air cooling Rosterology device!"

Riddle: "Sorry, Gabby, it never worked anyway."

Gabriel: *He chuckled and sighed, slouching in defeat.* "I-I know."

Riddle: "You ready?"

Gabriel: "Yeah!"

Riddle: "Watch this." *He closed his eyes and focused, causing his face to twitch with concentration.*

Gabriel: (Out of lightning and ground, I think Ridz will pick lightn-)

Riddle: "NIGHTSHADE" *He opened his eyes with determination and a stream of black lightning shot out of his hand, hitting the Rosterology console.*

Gabriel: "Wha-?" *He gasped and jumped in fright, falling off the wooden chair.* "Gah!-"

Riddle: "Hmph-" *He focused on the stream of lightning and pushed forward, causing the console to suddenly blow up.*

Gabriel: "Ah!-" *He listened to the explosion and ducked in a defensive manner.*

Riddle: "Phew-" *He relaxed his shoulders and smiled triumphantly, focusing his attention back to Gabriel.*

Gabriel: *He grabbed the wooden chair and pushed himself up, leaning over it in an awkward manner.* "What was that?"

Riddle: "Ha ha-" *He lowered his arm and walked over to Gabriel, helping him back onto his feet.*

Gabriel: "So, you did pick lightning?" *He pretended to know, looking at Riddle for clarification.*

Riddle: *He shook his head, twiddling his fingers.* "It looks like lightning, but that was just the Remenistal I used."

Gabriel: "If it wasn't lightning, what else could it have been?"

Riddle: "It's what I like to call darkness."

Gabriel: *He looked away, regaining his composure.* "Darkness? Ahem-" *He brushed dirt off his clothing, pushing his glasses up with one finger.* "Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot."

Riddle: "Gabriel, you're the only person who is as smart as me. I'd never insult your intelligence!"

Gabriel: "Humph." *He grunted in respect and faced Riddle, glancing at the destroyed Rosterology console.* "So, explain yourself."

Riddle: "Do you remember our fight with those abnormal Scoldrants?"

Gabriel: "Umm-" *He had flashbacks of the Scoldrants turning into shadow and merging into one.* "Y-Yes?"

Riddle: "Before Raphael destroyed them with his light-based Remenistal, I was able to collect part of their element as a sample."

Gabriel: "W-Wow." *He gasped under his breath, quickly walking towards the whiteboard.*

Riddle: "So, by using the shadow-"

Gabriel: "This makes sense-" *He unintentionally ignored Ridley and drew glyphs on the whiteboard, followed by lines of mathematical-like formulas.* "I thought your experiment was wrong."

Riddle: "Wrong?"

Gabriel: "Well, at least, I couldn't figure out the mechanics behind it-" *He stepped back and stared at the whiteboard, nodding his head.*

Riddle: "Gabby?"

Gabriel: "You changed the formula of how your Neurons percept the affinities, and it's exactly as you said-" *He mumbled the rest of the sentence, staring at the whiteboard in a researcher-like manner.*

Riddle: (So, he's figured it out-?)

Gabriel: "And since you haven't used Remenistal before, you-"

Riddle: "I was able to change my natural affinity with shadow, as Neurons are more flexible-"

Gabriel: *He glanced at Riddle, chuckling to himself with a widening smile.* "Amazing, gahaha!"

Riddle: "My new Remenistal powers are amazing, but-"

Gabriel: "That light Raphael used-" *He paused, sighing in a jealous manner.*

Riddle: (The light is far superior to anything I could have ever imagined.)

Gabriel: "Well, at least you've got a powerful element to show off now." *He turned around and faced Riddle, trying to brighten up the mood.*

Riddle: *He paused and looked down, kicking a broken piece of the Rosterology console he blew up.* "But you know what ticks my nerves?"

Gabriel: "You don't have to tell me, it was before Raphael left, wasn't it?"

Riddle: "Yes." *He nodded his head, slightly frowning in recollection.*

Gabriel: "He got me angry, such a waste of power." *He stepped away from the whiteboard and made his way towards the wooden chair.*

Riddle: "I know." *He turned around and leant on the stone wall, rubbing his arm in thought.*

*Sounds of busy footsteps and crowd-like chatter could be heard up outside, catching Gabriel's attention.*

Gabriel: *He looked up to the roof, listening to the chatter.* (Silver Wind Island is a little busy today.)

Riddle: (There's only one flaw in manipulating an affinity-) *He raised his arm, opening and closing his hand.* (And that's due to it not being a natural procedure.)

Gabriel: (The power of light..) *He looked down and scanned across the dungeon-like room in thought.* (How did Raphael harness it?)

Riddle: (It's a very difficult learning curve to grasp how to effectively use Remenistal-) *He watched a slight shadow-like residue envelop his fingers.* (Being a researcher, I know it's better to learn to walk before you try to start running.)

*Riddle sighed and lowered his arm, looking at Gabriel.*

Gabriel: "Hmm..." *He mumbled, noticing the burn marks around the Rosterology console.* "Ridz."

Riddle: "Yes?" *He coughed, focusing his attention to Gabriel.*

Gabriel: "If you were able to take a part of the Scoldrant's shadow as a sample for your affinity, why not-?"

Riddle: "Why not take a sample of the light?"

Gabriel: *He smiled, nodding his head in agreement.* "Well, even though he says you need Radiatons, there's nothing in any sort of formula supporting Radiatons." *He shrugged his shoulders to help support his opinion.*

Riddle: "The manipulation of light." *He nodded his head, twiddling his fingers.* "That's what I intend to do."

Gabriel: *He adjusted the wooden chair and sat down, looking over to the whiteboard.* "Intend to do? But you said it yourself. That can't be possible, Ridz."

Riddle: *He looked down, shaking his head in disgust.* "I respected that man in holy armour until-"

--

Sofia: "Shadow?" *She sounded disgusted while playfully smirking at Ridley.*

Ridley: "I knew so little back then." *He looked annoyed at himself.* "I didn't even know what powered these Shadiatons of mine."

Sofia: *She stepped closer to Ridley, flicking her ponytail over her shoulder.* "What did Raphael say?"

Ridley: "Such a waste of a gift."

Sofia: (This means a lot to him-) *She looked at Ridley, unsure what to say.* (This would be much easier if I could view his memory with a Crystalline Blossom-)

Ridley: "He threw our dream in our faces." *He looked up to Sofia and frowned in recollection, triggering another memory.*

--

Raphael: *He entered a forest with Riddle and Gabriel walking by his side.* "Make it hasty, thy did not expect to waste so much time on mere Scoldrants."

Riddle: *He stepped through a Reality Sekai and looked behind him to the rippling air.* (He knows his way around The Twilight Forest, even Gabby and I occasionally take a wrong Spacial Funnel or Reality Sekai and our knowledge is said to rival Scoldrant Users-)

Raphael: "Thy should have already addressed the situation with Silver Wind Island and be arriving home by now, yet, the former is still pending."

Gabriel: "Home?"

Raphael: "That is none of your concern." *He sighed without looking at Gabriel.*

Riddle: *He looked at Gabriel, focusing his attention back on Raphael.* "So what is a Valkyrie?"

Raphael: "The strongest being, humph." *His cape slightly flapped behind him, listening to the sounds of waves crashing in the distance.*

Gabriel: "What brought you here?"

Raphael: "The Shadiatons-"

Gabriel: "No, I mean otherwise."

Raphael: "A mission, which that too, is none of your concern."

Riddle: "That light bending you did. Why don't you protect cities, towns, villages-?"

Raphael: "Why would thy?"

Riddle: "H-Huh?" *He mumbled in shock, slightly leaning forward to look at Raphael's face.*

Gabriel: "What Ridz is trying to say, is that we want to protect the lands, but we don't have the power to do so."

Riddle: "But you do. So why don't you protect the lands? You're the strongest entity, as stated by yourself."

Raphael: "Thy have no intentions to do so. Thy will report back to my home and follow orders."

Riddle: "But, you're the strongest being-" *He shook his head in disbelief.* "You can protect everything! Lower the rate of crime, create peace with order-"

Raphael: "Such far-fetched ideas. There will always be evil in this world."

Gabriel: (Is this man joking?)

Riddle: "Evil? Sure there would be, but it would be controllable-"

Raphael: "What our superiors say, evil is necessary."

Gabriel: "Necessary?!"

Raphael: "Without light, you've got no life. And without darkness, you've got no soul. Both are needed to become whole."

Riddle: "But-"

Raphael: "Enough."

Gabriel: "A-Ah-?"

Raphael: (Peace is already obtained in Valhalla-)

Riddle: "I don't understand why you're coming across like this-"

Raphael: *He grunted with annoyance as he continued to walk to his destination.* "It is your childish dream, not mine."

Gabriel: (Peace, a childish dream?!)

Raphael: *He looked up, glancing at the sun's location.* (Thy better go, The Wise has summoned all The Sacred Knights after sunset.)

Riddle: "What about the lands-?"

Raphael: "Such annoyance-" *He frowned, glancing at Riddle and Gabriel.* "Thy will ignore Silver Wind Island and leave immediately."

Riddle: *He gasped with hurtful eyes.* "We didn't mean to be a nuisance-"

Gabriel: "Sir, Raphael, we are merely admiring your powers, why not help us save the lands-?"

Raphael: "This world is beyond saving." *He looked back up, causing a sudden burst of light to blind Riddle and Gabriel.*

Riddle: "Ah!-"
Gabriel: *He closed his eyes, quickly covering his face behind his glasses.* "Wha-?"

Riddle: (The air is artificially warm-) *He squinted his eyes, trying to spot Raphael in the light.* (This wasted power!)

Gabriel: (Is he leaving?) *His glasses reflected the bright light as a gust of wind pulsed around the area where Raphael stood.*

--

Sofia: (That sounds like Raphael alright.) "What happened after that?"

Ridley: "After the light vanished, he was gone." *He slowly stood up, forming fists on his sides.*

Sofia: "So what did you two do?"

Ridley: "We walked to Silver Wind Island, and back into Gabriel's research room."

Sofia: "I see."

--

Gabriel: "I hate to say, but I think we should move on-"

Riddle: "Move on...?" *He mumbled under his breath with no enthusiasm.*

Gabriel: *He paused and pointed to a box-like device, hiding his low morale.* "The Rosterology device to help filter Neuron impurities in the water?"

Riddle: "..."

Gabriel: "Ridz?" *He spoke in a defeated manner, waiting for Riddle's reply.*

Riddle: "No."

Gabriel: "Ridz, we have the same dream, but we can't do anything about it. We'll find another way-"

Riddle: "We have an opportunity to protect the lands like we've envisioned!"

Gabriel: *He sighed and focused his attention to the uncomfortable appearing Riddle.* "How?"

Riddle: "The reason why I couldn't take a sample of the light Raphael used was because of a couple of reasons." *He looked up and spoke in a thoughtful manner.*

Gabriel: "Alright, humour me, Ridz."

Riddle: "Number one. I was just amazed at his entity, and two, I would've required more time."

Gabriel: "Where are you going with this? You have dark Remenistal powers, one of a kind."

Riddle: "No."

Gabriel: "No?"

Riddle: "Experiment or not, it can't be one-of-a-kind." *He started to get excited over the topic.* "His power-"

Gabriel: "Okay, I don't see why you're getting so worked up about this. Yeah, we found someone with the power, but he lacks the integrity to do anything, so what?"

Riddle: *He paused and turned away, smirking in recollection.* "What was your latest experiment?"

Gabriel: (He totally just ignored me.) ".. The free Astragon shield generator?"

Riddle: "That's it. A shield powered by the free Astragons which flow in the air everywhere."

Gabriel: "What about it? It was a failure, the shield not only absorbed nearby Astragons but also drained the people inside the shield."

Riddle: "It was intended to protect travellers going from and to Silver Wind Island."

Gabriel: "I'm still not following you."

Riddle: "I never thought I'd ever do something like this, but I caught myself plotting a plan." *He sounded uncomfortable as if he was worried to tell Gabriel.*

Gabriel: "Ridz?" *He sounded weary, staring at Riddle's back in confusion.*

Riddle: *He walked over to a bench full of Rosterology devices, picking up a backpack-like bag.* "These powers I acquired are merely a stepping stone to help achieve our goal."

Gabriel: "Really?" *He gasped, as he discreetly smiled with hope.* "We definitely will, just not with Raphael-"

Riddle: "I'll tell you my plan along the way. If you disapprove, let me know and we'll stop at any moment." *He violently shoved stones into the bag and zipped it up.*

Gabriel: (If it's towards our dream, I wonder what would be so bad for me to disapprove?)

Riddle: "Sound good?" *He faced Gabriel with a smile, adjusting the straps to the bag on his back.*

Gabriel: "Arh, sure?" *He pushed up his glasses and stood up, tapping his toes to readjust his boots.*

Riddle: "Great." *He nodded his head in determination and ran towards a ladder with excitement.*

Gabriel: *He pulled his robes to make himself more comfortable, walking towards the ladder.* (Ridz, you've always had a way to pump me up or motivate me by words alone.) *He smirked to himself.*

Riddle: *He leant up and grabbed the ladder with focused attention, awkwardly climbing up.* "We're one step closer to our goal-"

Gabriel: (Motivational or not, I don't like it when Ridz is like this-) *He mumbled in thought, watching light shine around the ladder, as Riddle opened the door.*

Riddle: (I'm so nervous-) *He took a deep breath, glancing around the busy city.* (Am I actually going to do this?)

Gabriel: (Because if I don't keep up with him he gets pretty frustrated.) *He looked down, noticing Riddle's shadow move on the floor, as he stepped outside.*

Riddle: "Come on!" *He shouted with an echoing voice, alerting Gabriel.*

Gabriel: "Coming!"

--

Sofia: "What happened next? It's weird knowing there aren't any captains or warriors in this story."

Ridley: "Captains? Ah, that reminds me."

Sofia: "Of what?"

Ridley: "I'll tell you in a moment-"

Sofia: "OK." *She nodded her head.*

Ridley: *He closed his eyes and clapped, causing black glyphs to form on the back of his hands.* (Awaken!)

----------

*Metallic rattles echoed from the halls of Sorrowprax, as warriors moved about in the lower levels.*

*Four captains in warrior's armour jumped as if Ridley's voice startled them.*

Slender Man: "Y-You heard our master, l-let's go." *His voice muffled through an armour helmet.*

Silver-Haired Woman: *She adjusted her helmet and glanced at the slender warrior.* "Yes, whoever defies him, unforgivable!" *Her hair waved in her face, causing her to blow a blue streak out from her vision.*

Axe-Wielding Man: "How boring." *He grunted with a deep voice, adjusting two folded axes on his back.*

Green-Haired Woman: *She blew out a steam of mist as if she was smoking.* "You heard him, let's go."

*The four captains flashstepped one by one out of a small dark, laboratory-like room.*

----------

Ridley: "Okay." *He opened his eyes and lowered his arms, coughing to clear his throat.* "Sofia."

Sofia: "Y-Yes?"

Ridley: "I told him my plan, my very wrong plan. And-" *He paused in recollection.* "He accepted."

--

*Riddle and Gabriel flashstepped in the middle of an open field, surrounded by trees.*

Gabriel: *His blonde hair flapped in the breeze.* "Where have you taken us?"

Riddle: "South West of the continent."

Gabriel: *He grabbed his glasses with both hands and squinted his eyes, looking into the far distance.* "Is that The Elemental Tower in the distance?"

Riddle: "Yes." *He stepped to the side, glancing over his shoulder.*

Gabriel: "What is it? Do you sense something?"

Riddle: "I haven't had the chance to investigate, but there were rumours about the elemental city going to ruins-"

Gabriel: *He quickly interrupted Riddle with a cough, catching his attention.* "So how do you intend to start your plan?"

Riddle: "Oh? Erhm, with these-" *He rocked forward, flicking the bag off his back.* "And your barrier-"

Gabriel: "Right, right." *He stepped closer, causing Riddle to mumble the rest of his plan.*

----------

Raphael: *He walked across a large floating island, causing sunlight to shimmer off his armour.* (I never thought Cassidy would betray us over that woman.) *He shook his head in disappointment and listened to a stream of water, watching it fall off the island like a waterfall.*

*Several winged women glided in circles and flapped their feathered wings, suddenly diving into the clouds in a playful manner.*

Raphael: *He sighed and rubbed his shoulder, grunting in recollection.* (That night, the fight with our cousins was frightening.) *He had flashbacks of several villagers manipulating the elements.*

*A dove dived down and flew past Raphael, causing him to gasp.*

Raphael: *He quickly looked over his shoulder and watched the dove fly into the distance with widening eyes.* (The Wise? Why do they want me?)

*Raphael spun around and stared at vacant sky, focusing on the space.*

Raphael: "Humph-" *His eyes shined gold, causing a large castle to warp into his vision.* (I better go-) *He flashstepped, causing long strands of grass to swirl around where he stood.*

-

*Raphael flashstepped under a ray of light in a dark room, instantly kneeling down in respect.*

The Wise: "Raphael, being an active Sacred Knight on duty, thou are to investigate another Shadiaton signature."

Raphael: "Another-?"

The Wise: "Why do thou speak? We didn't ask thou a question." *An elderly voice echoed with authority.*

Raphael: "My apologies, continue." *He spoke in an apologetic manner, keeping his head lowered.*

The Wise: "We don't usually send a Sacred Knight to merely check abnormal signatures, but Shadiatons with such latent power cannot be ignored."

Raphael: "If I may?"

The Wise: "Go ahead."

Raphael: "What is the urgency with Shadiatons?"

The Wise: "Radiatons, its power is varied upon emotions. Shadiatons' power is derived from one's drive.. In the hands of an egotistical mortal, it is possible to create an imbalance."

Raphael: *He looked confused.* "Thy thought it had to do with corruption?"

The Wise: "Radiatons and Shadiatons are not only sources of energy, but they are also elements-"

The Wise: "After the corruption and destruction of our mortal cousins, anything that threatens that balance needs to be eradicated."

Raphael: "What is your definition of balance?"

The Wise: "It appears Raphael's freedom may be influencing his respect-?"

Raphael: "Forgive me-" *He intensely stared at the floor.*

The Wise: "What do thou think is happening down there? When was the last time Madora reached out to us?!" *A woman's voice mumbled to the man speaking, causing Raphael to slightly look up in confusion.*

Raphael: "The Wise?"

The Wise: "Eliminate any darkness you encounter. That is all." *A man's stern voice shouted at Raphael in response.*

Raphael: "Yes." *He nodded his head and slightly leant up, flashstepping out of the room.*

--

*A ray of light blasted down from the sky and hit the ground, causing grass and rocks to swirl around it.*

Raphael: "Hmm?" *He proudly stepped out of the expanding sphere of light and looked around, observing an open field.* (This is where the Shadiatons were detected-)

*Raphael paused and noticed the area was quiet, giving the feeling of it being secluded.*

Raphael: (Surrounded by trees? Perhaps the creatures live in the forest, like the scum they are-)

*An arrow whistled through the air at incredible speeds directly towards Raphael, generating visible swirls of wind around it.*

Raphael: *He sidestepped with widening eyes as the arrow flew through his hair.* "Through my hair!-"

*Black lightning sparked from the forest, suddenly striking towards Raphael's back.*

Raphael: (Hidden from the shadows-?!) *He sidestepped and twirled around, causing the lightning to pierce through his cape past him.* (That was close!-)

*Another four arrows shot past Raphael's head, causing him to audibly gasp.*

Raphael: (I was not expecting this!-) *A thin cut opened across his cheek.*

Riddle: *He stood in the midst of trees, as his body glowed a shade of blue.* "Crimson Shade." *He shouted with an echoing voice, purposely positioning himself in the shadows.*

Raphael: "Thy heard thou!-" *He spun around and faced the direction of Riddle's voice, pointing towards it.* "HOLY LA-"

*Black and red lightning fell from the sky and sparked around Raphael, causing the ground to explode.*

Raphael: "Argh!-"

Gabriel: "Harh-" *He jumped into the clearing, pulling the string to his bow.*

Raphael: "Pathetic-"

Riddle: "DEMONIC SIOVANCE" *He revealed himself and cupped both hands towards Raphael.* "Harh!-" *Winds blew around him and a black glyph drew itself under Raphael.*

Gabriel: "Ithna Ashara Shot!" *He flicked the string to his bow back and fired a dozen arrows towards Gabriel, watching them soar through the air.*

Raphael: (Thy can't move-?!) *He looked down in shock as several arrows shot into his chest.* (That's the glyphic symbol for Holy Lance but slightly different!-)

*Black strings flicked up from the glyph, suddenly wrapping themselves around Raphael's legs.*

Raphael: "Power of Radiatons!" *His eyes shined gold, violently disintegrating the surrounding shadows.*

Gabriel: *He pulled the string to his bow as far as it could go.* "Windstream Shot-" *He released the string, shooting an arrow made of wind towards Raphael at high speeds.*

Raphael: "Blasphemy-" *He quickly focused his attention to the arrow and braced himself, blocking the wind with his hands.*

Riddle: (He blocked it-?!)

Gabriel: (Don't underestimate my arrows!-)

Raphael: *He suddenly slid on his toes back due to the force.* (Strong!-)

Riddle: "NIGHTSHADE" *He enthusiastically pushed his hand forward, blasting a stream of black lightning through Raphael's knee.*

Raphael: *He gritted his teeth in pain, watching the amour around his knee shatter off.* "This-"

Gabriel: "Ridz, now?!"

Riddle: "Do it, Gabby!"

Gabriel: *He threw a clear stone at Raphael, causing a transparent bubble-like shield to appear around him.* "Great."

Riddle: *He smirked with growing accomplishment, watching the shield solidify around Raphael.* (Excellent!-)

Raphael: *He watched the wind-based arrow suddenly vacuum into the shield, causing him to lower his arms.* (The Astragons in that pitiful Azure Burst disappeared?)

Riddle: (It should by theory absorb the Astragons in my Remenistal-)

Raphael: "This abomination! Thou lowly peasants!-"

Riddle: "Darkened volt, burn a cross and cause the opponent to halt, let your existence fade-"

*Wind started to vacuum the surrounding area into the shield, causing its texture to thicken.*

Raphael: *He glanced at the shield then to his knee, frowning in thought.* (How utterly disgusting! To be harmed in such a manner.)

Gabriel: (Ridz only acquired his new Remenistal powers recently, and look at the level of techniques already at his disposal.)

Raphael: *He gritted his teeth, ripping the arrows out of his chest with a twitching eye.* (Something is draining me-)

Riddle: "Argh!" *Dirt blew up into the air around him and a strong gust blew it away.* (I'll put everything into this! After previous observations, light is weakened to dark just as much dark is to light!)

Raphael: *He threw the arrows away in disgust, quickly looking at Riddle in shock.* (Shadiatons? Those abnormal signatures?! They came from him?!)

Riddle: "NIGHTSHADE" *He pushed forward, blasting a tree-sized, dark-as-night lightning towards the shield.*

Gabriel: *He watched the lightning hit the shield, covering his ears with growing discomfort.* (The lightning sounds like screeching strings!)

Riddle: *He watched the lightning swirl into the shield, causing it to slowly burn black.* (Everything is going according to plan.)

Raphael: *The golden shine of his eyes faded, cueing him to drop to the ground in exhaustion.* "This cannot-"

Riddle: *He poured a continuous stream of black lightning into the shield, watching his arms violently shake.* (His power shows! This amount of Astragon input would've sent a dozen men to sleep by now-)

Raphael: "Be-" *He took a deep breath, shaking his head in a confused manner.* "-Possible."

Gabriel: *He started to slide towards the shield as its vacuum intensified.* "No-"

Riddle: (That's it-) *He watched the shield drain the rest of his lightning, causing him to step back in exhaustion.*

Gabriel: *His hair flapped in his face, as the shield continued to push him forward.* (It didn't work! Ridz said the shield would've exploded due to-)

Raphael: *He noticed the darkness in the shield block his vision.* (Thy will not allow these lowly peasants succeed in whatever they are doing!) "HOLY LA-"

Riddle: *The shield suddenly exploded, causing a pulse of smoke-like shadow to waft past him.* (Excellent-) *He sighed in thought, ignoring burns around his hands.*

Gabriel: *He stumbled back as the vacuum-like pull stopped.* (The explosion of the shield-)

Raphael: *He gasped in pain and awkwardly leant back, shrouded in a cloud of thick smog-like darkness.* (Thy have never experienced this before-?)

Riddle: "Now, the affinity changeover!"

Gabriel: "What? Now?!" *He gasped, looking at Riddle in shock.*

Riddle: "Yes!" *He grunted with all his concentration, causing identical glyphs to draw themselves under Raphael and Gabriel's feet.* (If I lose an ounce of focus he will break free.)

Gabriel: *He held a handful of arrows and gently placed one on the bow, pulling the string back.* (I'm sorry-) *He aimed the bow at Raphael, suddenly shooting six times in a skilful and fluid manner.*

Raphael: *His body bounced back, as the sounds of arrows piercing his flesh could be heard.* "Arh-" *He looked to his arms, noticing three arrows pierced in each.*

Riddle: *He watched the glyphs pulsate darkness, causing him to slightly lower his arms with less focus.* "It's ready."

Raphael: *He waved the air across Riddle, suddenly gasping at his hand in shock.* "How did thou drain my powers?"

Riddle: "We absorbed all your Astragons."

Gabriel: *He stepped closer and lowered the bow as if Raphael wasn't a threat any more.* "And every arrow I shot had a powerful paralysing elixir around the tip."

Raphael: *He chuckled in a low tone, catching Riddle and Gabriel's attention.* "Thy don't need Astragons and thy'm immune to any status alignment!" *His body shined white.*

Riddle: (As predicted, he's releasing Radiatons! Excellent.)

Raphael: *His smile slowly faded.* "Huh?" *He grunted with a dropping jaw, watching two streams of golden sand swirl out from his eyes.*

Riddle: (I needed the Radiatons for the process to initiate.)

Gabriel: (For the good of the lands..) *He took a deep nervous breath, closing his eyes in a guilty manner.* (For the good of the lands.. I need to keep telling myself that.)

Raphael: "W-What?!" (My limbs are growing heavy.)

Riddle: *He watched the golden sand dance and swirl in the air, as an air current pushed it towards Gabriel.* (Focus! Focus! Focus!)

Gabriel: *He gasped and opened his eyes, as the sand poured into his mouth and eyes.* "Kahg-"

Riddle: *He shook his head and dropped to one knee, causing the wind to die down.* "I think that-"

Raphael: *His body seized up.* (Without my Radiatons, thy don't have the self-healing ability.) *His body started to shake.*

Gabriel: *He dropped to his knees which knocked the glasses off his face.* "I don't feel so good."

Riddle: *He took a deep breath and stood back up, watching Raphael continue to shake.* (Gabby's poison must affect him now.)

Raphael: *White orbs started to float up from his body.* "This is inconceivable! This cannot be possible! Thou two are mortals!" *He dribbled, staring at Riddle and Gabriel with anger filled eyes.*

Gabriel: *He stood up in a proud manner, glancing at Raphael with a mature expression.* "If this worked, I promise you I'll use it for the greater good."

Raphael: "Thou fools, love was not given to-" *His body fully disintegrated into white orbs, which pulsated and shined into the sky.*

*A gust of wind blew across the clearing and took evidence of the glyphs with it.*

Riddle: *He paused and listened to the sounds of wind blowing through the forest.* "G-Gabby?" *He wiped his forehead and faced Gabriel, looking at him in concern.*

Gabriel: "I don't think it worked, Ridz." *He opened and closed his hands, shaking his head in failure.*

Riddle: *He paused in disappointment and looked down, noticing Gabriel's glasses on the ground.* "Well, your eyes-" *Sticks cracking in the forest caught his attention.* "Who's there-?"

Scoldrant: *It roared from the trees and stamped its hairless leg into the clearing, facing Gabriel and Riddle with hunger-filled eyes.* "Graoofth!"

Riddle: *He gasped in shock, facing the Scoldrant in fear.* "It's one of those violent ones!"

Gabriel: "No! What's that doing here?"

Riddle: "Maybe the commotion with Raphael attracted it?"

Gabriel: (Just our luck!)

Riddle: (I can't use any Remenistal! I'm all tapped out-)

Gabriel: "Luck? Maybe this is what we deserve! Committing a terrible crime for nothing!" *He picked up the bow, pulling the string in distress.*

Riddle: "I'm sorry, Gabby."

Gabriel: *He sniffed and shook his head with watering eyes.* "Don't be." *He flicked the string and a blast of white light soared through the air, exploding the vicinity around the Scoldrant.*

Riddle: *He watched the light explode into a massive dirt cloud, listening to the sounds of thick trees snapping in shock.* "What-?!"

Scoldrant: "Skerarh!" *It screeched in disbelief, watching parts of its body vaporise into light.*

Riddle: (Wow-) *His jaw dropped, as a delayed gale-like force pushed him back.*

Gabriel: *His eyes widened as his clothes and hair rapidly flapped backwards.* (Did I do that?)

*The wind and dirt settled, allowing Riddle and Gabriel to regain their composure.*

Gabriel: *He lowered his head and paused, slowly moving his arms and legs.* "Th-This power?"

Riddle: "Gabby, communication, what's happening?"

Gabriel: *He looked up and faced Riddle as if he was in pain.* "Ridz-" *He spoke under his breath and ran up to Riddle, tightly hugging him in a hopeful-like manner.*

Riddle: "Gabby-?"

Gabriel: *He stepped back, smiling in excitement.* "Let's go."

Riddle: "H-Huh? W-Where?" *He looked at Gabriel puzzled.*

Gabriel: "Back to Silver Wind Island and find the list, then onwards to The Guild's Tavern."

Riddle: "Umm, okay-" *He hesitantly agreed to Gabriel's desire, unsure how to respond.*

Gabriel: *He smiled and closed his eyes, tilting his head up to the clouds.* (Teleportation, I can easily grasp what Astragons to gather and the symbols to draw-) *A purple glyph drew itself under his feet.*

*A light flickered on the ground caused by Gabriel's glyph, catching Riddle's attention.*

Riddle: "Huh?" *He mumbled and stared at the flickering light, slowly walking towards it.* (Gabby's glasses?) *He picked up the glasses and looked to his side, staring at Gabriel's glyph.*

Gabriel: *He watched the glyph shine brighter, as it made a humming sound.* "It's ready-"

Riddle: "R-Right." *He tightly held the glasses and ran towards Gabriel, stepping on the glyph.*

Gabriel: "Hmph!" *He clapped his hands, causing a blinding light to teleport them out of the area.*

--

Sofia: (My love defeated, Raphael.) *She froze in shock, taking the time to register what Ridley said.* (I always knew he was amazing, but no mortal could have possibly ever defeated a Sacred Knight.)

Ridley: "I hope I'm not boring you."

Sofia: *She gasped and enthusiastically shook her head.* "No, not at all! I'm not sure if it's your storytelling, but it seems rushed at the moment.. Didn't you take time to see if Gabriel was alright?"

Ridley: *He shook his head, frowning in recollection.* "Maybe it is my storytelling, or maybe both, but Gabriel didn't give me a chance to check on him until we made it back to Silver Wind Island."

Sofia: "Hahehahe, you should level up the pacing of your story."

Ridley: *He smiled with a mixture of his emotions.* "He was so preoccupied with what was happening with his body, he didn't even have time to tell Shadah or Ruhan.."

Sofia: "Harh?"

Ridley: "His wife and son."

Sofia: "OK-" *She nodded her head as if she wanted Ridley to continue his story.*

Ridley: "I remember the particles of light and the noises they made when I was on the glyph-"

--

*A white glyph began to draw itself in the middle of a dungeon-like room, causing it to light up.*

Gabriel: "Phew-" *He stepped off the glyph, taking a deep breath.*

Riddle: *He stumbled off the glyph, glancing to each side with disorientation.* "Gab-" *He shook his head in confusion, dropping to one knee in fatigue.*

Gabriel: *He turned around in shock, quickly bending down to Riddle's aid.* "Ridz?"

Riddle: *He started to sweat and pant.* "I think it's merely the effects of teleportation."

Gabriel: "Will you be okay? Should I use the Rosterology scanner-?"

Riddle: "Ha ha, I'm fine. I've felt like this before in one of my previous experiments. It just means either my Neurons or Astragons are out of sync."

Gabriel: *He leant up, smiling in relief.* "Good!"

Riddle: "So, what about you? Are you in pain? Do you feel stronger? Any side effects? Was the experiment successful?!" *He started to overexert himself, causing Gabriel to chuckle in flattery.*

Gabriel: "Gahaha. I'm great, not in any pain at all and I feel much stronger." *He formed a fist, symbolising to Riddle he was in good shape.*

Riddle: "Good."

Gabriel: "If there're any side effects, I wouldn't know about it." *He scanned the area as if he was looking for something.* "And I'm pretty sure you can see if the experiment was a success or not."

Riddle: "So why are we here? Maybe you should have some rest or at least let me do a diagnostic scan-"

Gabriel: "I feel absolutely fine." *He smiled and went to push his glasses up.* "Huh? My glass-"

Riddle: "Here?" *He smiled, twirling Gabriel's glasses around with his finger.*

Gabriel: "It looks like I don't need them any more?"

Riddle: *He walked over to a bench and gently placed the glasses down.* "You said the list. So I guess you're here for this then?" *He placed the backpack-like bag on the table, picking up a sheet of paper.*

Gabriel: "The list?"

Riddle: *He nodded his head, waving the sheet of paper.* "You were looking for this, correct?"

Gabriel: "You know me too well." *He smirked, nudging his head to the paper.* "What does the first one say?"

Riddle: "Discover the disappearances of several villagers surrounding The Swirling Marshes-"

Gabriel: "Right!" *He waved his hand, causing a white glyph to form itself on the ground.*

Riddle: *He turned around in shock, glancing at the glyph.* "What, like now?"

Gabriel: "Well, I am." *He walked towards the glyph, staring at Riddle.*

Riddle: "Oh?"

Gabriel: "But, I want you to be by my side-"

Riddle: "We're basically brothers, I'll always be by your side."

Gabriel: "And so you should, this is our dream." *He closed his eyes and vanished in a flash of purple light.*

Riddle: (Gabby...) *He rolled up the sheet of paper and walked forward, stepping on the glyph.*

*The glyph hummed and a sudden flash of blinding light teleported Riddle out of Silver Wind Island.*

--

Sofia: "So, from what you told me, this is a little out of Gabriel's character."

Ridley: *He ran his hand along the wall as if continuous flashbacks kept flooding his mind.* "Not really when you think about it."

Sofia: "Harh?"

Ridley: "He was finally able to obtain our dream, anyone would've been like that."

Sofia: *She looked down, taking the time to think about it.* "I suppose so, having a dream or target is what keeps the game going."

Ridley: "No matter what I do now or how many times I play it in my mind, I'm always left amazed at how much good we did that day."

Sofia: "What makes you say that?"

Ridley: *He turned around and stared at Sofia, causing her to look up at him.* "We did the entire list on that one day." *He smiled with happiness.*

Sofia: *She observed his facial expressions.* (The accomplishment in his face, only a true winner can express such a victorious smile.)

--

*Insects buzzed above slowly moving mud which expelled steam.*

Riddle: *He hunched forward filled with fatigue, watching Gabriel stand tall in front of him.* (I've exhausted all my Neurons.)

Gabriel: "Please, Ancioldrant!" *He looked up, yelling at a large cockroach-like creature.*

Ancioldrant: *It towered over Gabriel, twitching its head in an insect-like manner.* "No, I enjoy feasting on those petty travellers." *Its deep croaky voice sent shivers down Riddle's back.*

Riddle: (That was a tough battle, and Gabriel shows no signs of fatigue.)

Gabriel: "Bless the spirits." *He looked down and stood in a serious manner, catching the Ancioldrant's attention.*

Ancioldrant: "Harh-?"

Gabriel: "ORPHAN'S CRADLE" *He zigzagged his arms and clicked his fingers.*

Riddle: *Vibrations caused the mud around him to bubble.* "Huh? Gabby-" *He looked down to the mud while sounding worried.*

Gabriel: *He smirked, as his body shined a shade of white.* "Don't worry-"

*A large celestial serpent slithered into the air, lighting up the area with its radiant shine.*

Ancioldrant: "A Summonce Scarbra?"

Riddle: (Is that creature alive? Is this really Gabby's doing?!) *He froze with uncertainty, staring at the growing serpent in shock.*

Gabriel: "No, it's not a Summonce Scarbra-"

*The serpent sprouted feathered wings and opened its jaw, alerting the Ancioldrant.*

Riddle: (Wow.)

Ancioldrant: "Allow me to feast on travellers in peace! Attack like a blinding avalanche, Geodust Gollem-"

Gabriel: (Now-)

*A massive white pulsar shot out from the serpent's mouth and hit the Ancioldrant, causing the area to suddenly become quiet.*

Gabriel: *He turned around and walked towards Riddle, causing the serpent to disintegrate into a swirl of light.* "Next on the list?"

Riddle: *He froze in amazement, looking at the Ancioldrant with a dropping jaw.* "...-"

Ancioldrant: "Clhick!" *It clicked and twitched with struggle, blocking the pulsar of light with its antenna.*

Riddle: "It blocked!-"

Gabriel: "Ridz, as what you would say, focus." *He smirked and clicked his fingers, causing a blinding purple light to teleport them out of the marshes.*

Ancioldrant: *It clicked in pain, as a massive shockwave-like pulsar exploded around it, erupting waves of mud into the air.* "Clhick, clhick-"

*Mud-like Scoldrants hopped away from the wave like frogs, ignoring loud thunder-like noises which rumbled from the light.*

Ancioldrant: "The light, it burns!" *Its body suddenly disintegrated into the expanding light.*

*The waves of mud suddenly blasted in all directions, covering the trees and surroundings.*

--

Ridley: "Could you shed light on what attack that was?"

Sofia: "Orphan's Cradle.. Herm?" *She placed a finger on her lips, humming in thought.* "I remember being told that everything was passed down from Radiatons."

Ridley: (Passed down? It's like instinct... That's extraordinary.)

Sofia: "So maybe summoning was also passed down too?"

Ridley: "So you think it was a summoning?"

Sofia: "Possibly, it's not unheard of someone using their parents Ougi's only just after acquiring their powers."

Ridley: "Interesting. Although, I think it was just a strong Remenistal?"

Sofia: *She shook her head, looking up in thought.* "If it wasn't a summoning, then it could've been a type of Ougi or Grand Remenistal."

Ridley: (Even to this day, there's still so much stuff to learn. It's so strange, the more knowledge I acquire, the more I realise how little I actually know-)

Sofia: "I wouldn't know for certain. It wasn't until recently I unlocked mine." *She smiled, staring at Ridley with golden changing eyes.*

Ridley: "Passed down.." *He smiled for Sofia and her new eyes.* "Not really solid evidence, but I suppose there's nothing else to guess what kind of technique Gabriel used."

Sofia: "Erumph." *She grunted, nodding her head in agreement.*

--

*A massive crowd circled around the lowest level in Silver Wind Island, staring at Gabriel and an abnormally large man with anticipation.*

Gabriel: "Foul beast, you dare disguise yourself within this beautiful community?!"

Riddle: *He stared at Gabriel from the front of the crowd.* (This Scoldrant has been spreading lies and hate between the citizens to make them despise the ruler.)

Gabriel: "You have no right to take that shape of a man!"

Scoldrant: *It snickered as all of its hair fell off at once.* "I had a few believers, and I would've gotten away with the assassination of the ruler-" *It sidestepped and revealed Grey and Ordin unconscious on the ground behind it, causing several people to gasp.*

Gabriel: "Humph." *He smirked on one side of his mouth, reaching into the air.* "You will meet the same fate as all my other foes!" *White aura materialised around his hand and fluidly moved, forming itself into a bow.*

Villager: *She nervously watched from the crowd, staring at Ordin in disbelief.* (How did that Scoldrant take down the ruler and Ordin? I've seen Ordin fight and his skills have been unmatched.)

Scoldrant: "Rarr!" *It screamed with a darkening skin colour, causing veins to pop out around its neck and arms.*

Gabriel: "Revealed your true self.." *He watched the bow solidify into its shape.*

Girl: "Wow, his bow is made of light!" *She spoke under her breath in pure amazement, causing nearby villagers to nod their heads in agreement.*

Gabriel: *His body shined a shade of blue, catching Riddle's attention.* "Humph."

Riddle: (Gabby has only started to tap into the powers of Radiatons-)

Gabriel: "Swift Prism." *He pulled the string and fired an arrow of light, which suddenly blasted into a ray of light.*

Scoldrant: "Harh-" *It jumped to the side, closely avoiding the ray of light.* "Misssssed-"

*The light suddenly stopped just behind the Scoldrant in mid-air and exploded into a holy prism, trapping it inside.*

Riddle: *He listened to the crowd awe at the light, causing him to chuckle.* "..."

Scoldrant: *It punched the shield, trying to break free.* "What is this?!" *Its roars couldn't be heard outside the shield.*

Gabriel: *He glanced at the bow of light and flicked the string, causing the prism to implode.* "What's done is done-"

*Silence filled the air, as the crowd silently watched tiny white orbs float into the sky.*

Gabriel: "Fellow citizens, you have nothing to fear!"

*The crowd cheered and roared in delight to their hero, breaking the circle around him.*

Riddle: *He smirked, nodding his head in amazement.* (Good work, Gabby!)

Villager: *A man raised his arm, catching nearby villagers' attention.* "A victory celebration is in order!"

Gabriel: "Gahaha, I'm sorry, but there are other people in need!" *He smiled with gratitude, as a purple glyph formed under his feet.*

Riddle: *He smiled and stared at the crowd, admiring Gabriel's applause.* (This happiness.. Peace-)

Gabriel: "Hurry up." *He mumbled without moving his lips, nodding his head for Riddle to come.*

Riddle: *He snapped out of his daze and nodded his head, running towards the glyph.* "Sorry."

Villager: "We'll have one nonetheless, in your honour!"

Gabriel: *He smiled, listening to the villagers' yells and roar of cheers.* "That was close, if you didn't give me the tip of using a technique like that, then that arrow would've missed."

Riddle: "You're fine." *He glanced at Gabriel, smiling in a modest manner.*

Gabriel: "No, Ridz, the arrow could've missed and shot a villager." *He kept a straight face, as a blinding light teleported them away.* "Thank you."

*Sounds of continuous applause and chatter echoed throughout the city.*

--

Sofia: "You were amazing." *She smiled, staring at Ridley with shining gold eyes.*

Ridley: "Thank you, but I wasn't the one doing the work though."

Sofia: *She pouted, glancing across the cave with perfect vision.* "..."

Ridley: "Sofia? What's the matter?"

Sofia: "You were there when I woke up.. All these years, and you've never told me these stories." *She sounded annoyed.*

Ridley: "Oh?"

Sofia: "Either way, continue, I'm really fascinated where this is going."

Ridley: *He nodded his head, looking up in recollection.* "After doing several quests like that, we came to our last one."

Sofia: (Last one?)

--

*Cold gusts of wind blew snow across a white ground.*

Riddle: *He looked up, shivering in thought.* (This battle went very quickly, I didn't even participate in this one.)

Gabriel: *He landed on the ground, causing his feet to sink in the snow.* "Phew-"

*Three white baboon-like Scoldrants fell onto the snow, lying motionless in awkward positions.*

Riddle: *He tightly held onto himself, as he endured the cold, watching white orbs float up from the Scoldrants.* (He's getting better and better.)

Gabriel: *He turned around and sighed in relief, walking up to Riddle.* "Did you want to head back to Eon City-?"

Riddle: "Somewhere else! Where it's not snowing."

Gabriel: "Got it-" *He smiled and clicked his fingers, instantly teleporting them out of the snowy terrain in a flash of purple light.*

-

Riddle: *He gasped and awkwardly stepped forward, squinting his eyes with disorientation.* "Oh dear." *He shivered and started to relax, spinning around with a smile.*

Gabriel: "Better?"

Riddle: *Sunlight shined on his head as he walked away from Gabriel, inspecting the area.* "Yes, next time I'm bringing the correct garments for that type of environment."

Gabriel: "Gahaha, my apologies. I don't really feel the cold as much as I used too."

Riddle: "So-" *He looked around, raising an eyebrow in confusion.* "Where are we?"

Gabriel: *He stood in front of a cave's entrance, staring at Riddle's back.* "Here, take a look at what I found."

Riddle: "Hmm?" *He turned around, facing the cave.* "What's special about this one?"

Gabriel: "You know when we both went through our crazy brainstorming?"

Riddle: "Which one?"

Gabriel: "Gaha, but seriously?"

Riddle: "Yes I do?"

Gabriel: "Well, this is where I like to think-" *He turned back around, staring at the cave with a smile of nostalgia.* "-Secluded from the people and at peace."

Riddle: "Haha." *He laughed in a nervous manner.* "Now you're the one that's talking weirdly."

Gabriel: *He smiled, rolling his eyes.* "Don't be mean."

Riddle: "Sorry, sorry." *He coughed and regained his composure, taking a step forward.* "So, why are we here?"

Gabriel: *He paused and turned back around, staring at Riddle.* "Ridz.."

Riddle: "Yes?"

Gabriel: *He closed his eyes and smirked with a widening smile.* "Umm..-"

Riddle: "What is it? You're starting to worry me."

Gabriel: "I wanted to show you-" *He spoke with excitement, slowly opening his eyes.* "-This-" *He revealed his beautiful golden coloured eyes.*

Riddle: *He gasped, taking a step back in disbelief.* "G-Gabby."

Gabriel: "These are the holy eyes Raphael had."

Riddle: "That's so amazing!" *He spoke under his breath and smiled in amazement, slowly walking towards Gabriel.*

Gabriel: "I know!"

Riddle: "How?"

Gabriel: "I don't know. I was just thinking up little scenarios about our dream and suddenly I felt this warmth flood into my eyes."

Riddle: "I really don't understand? You were just thinking and that somehow activated your powers?"

Gabriel: "Yeah?" *He shrugged his shoulders, staring at Riddle in a dumbfounded manner.*

--

Sofia: "Hahehahe, my love. Radiatons are emotion induced."

Ridley: "Well, I didn't know at the time." *He spoke with a smile, glancing at Sofia.*

Sofia: "I wanna hear more on Gabriel's levelling up!"

Ridley: "Well-"

--

Riddle: *He stood outside the cave with Gabriel and looked up, smiling at the setting sun.* "It's been a very long day."

Gabriel: "What makes you say that, Ridz?"

Riddle: "The list-." *He looked at Gabriel, unintentionally staring at his golden eyes in a fixated manner.* "We completed the whole thing including, all the current quests at The Guild's Tavern."

Gabriel: "A very good effort, but what's your point, Ridz?"

Riddle: "The quests were projected to be completed in at least sixty times the amount it took you to do it."

Gabriel: *He shook his head, frowning in disagreement.* "You're wrong."

Riddle: "Excuse me?"

Gabriel: "Sixty times the amount it took us to do it."

Riddle: (Oh, Gabby.) *He smiled in thought, glancing at the cave to his side.* "So why did you take us here?"

Gabriel: *He glanced at the cave, looking at Riddle with a smile.* "Because now I'm ready to sit down and discuss how we're going to accomplish our dream."

Riddle: *He discreetly smiled, focusing all his attention on the conversation.* "Oh, excellent."

Gabriel: "This feels really weird?" *He looked at his hands and shook his head, pulling a weird facial expression.*

Riddle: "How so?"

Gabriel: "We're finally discussing our dream. No more hypothetical questions, this is it."

Riddle: "Haha, I know! Do you have anything in mind?"

Gabriel: "Well, now that we've eliminated all the current threats, I was thinking we should focus on hate."

Riddle: "Hate?"

Gabriel: "The emotion that causes evil."

Riddle: "So, you're aiming for peace?"

Gabriel: "Wasn't that our dream?"

Riddle: *He looked down to the ground, taking the time to think about it.* "When I think about it, I didn't think about focusing on people either."

Gabriel: "Unfortunately, there are some people that will stand in our dream's way."

Riddle: "You're absolutely right!"

Gabriel: "Next, we should advance our civilisation by having readily available information for all villages and cities, I don't agree with keeping information to one city or database."

Riddle: "That sounds great, Gabby!"

Gabriel: "So, I'll need that genius brain of yours to help me plan how to do that."

Riddle: "Hmm, hate...?" *He placed a finger on his chin, humming in a brainstorming-like manner.*

Gabriel: *He shook his head, watching Riddle frown in deep thought.* "I'm stumped. I don't know how to tackle hate or what to do with the people from stopping our dream from coming to fruition."

Riddle: "Gabby, just having a quick thought-"

Gabriel: "Let me hear it." *He eagerly interrupted Riddle.*

Riddle: "It was the feeling I had when the citizens of Silver Wind Island were applauding you."

Gabriel: "Hmm?" *He leant forward with growing interest, motioning Riddle to continue with his hand.*

Riddle: "It would be nice to have a few good-hearted followers help us out."

Gabriel: "Have different sources of people helping us.." *He looked shocked and nodded his head in agreement.* "See I wouldn't have thought of that."

Riddle: "Maybe an incentive like, having their power ranked?" *He shrugged his shoulders as if he wasn't sure it was a good idea.*

Gabriel: "We'll have plenty of time to-to.. To-" *He awkwardly spoke under his breath and coughed.*

Riddle: *He tilted his head in curiosity.* "Gabby?"

Gabriel: *He placed his hand on his throat, quickly swallowing to say something.* "Was just a slight tickle in my throat."

Riddle: "Oh, okay-"

Gabriel: "Argh!" *He gagged and bent forward, holding his stomach in pain.*

Riddle: "Gabby, not funny-"

Gabriel: "Grah-" *He wheezed and gagged, suddenly vomiting on the ground.*

Riddle: *He stepped back, staring at the vomit with widening eyes.* "What's going on?!"

Gabriel: "I don't know!-"

Riddle: *He leant down, touching Gabriel's shoulder in concern.* "Your Neurons and Astragons have overworked themselves?" *He sounded confused and glanced around Gabriel, unsure what to do.*

Gabriel: "Neurons and Astragons are-" *He grunted in pain, wiping his mouth in disgust.* "-Energy, they can't be tired."

Riddle: "I-I know.."

Gabriel: "It's not possible."

Riddle: "I know!"

--

Ridley: "Tssk." *He gritted his teeth, placing one hand on the wall.*

Sofia: "My love?"

Ridley: "I apologise, I seem to be getting a little emotional."

Sofia: "It's fine."

Ridley: "Fine? It strikes me as odd that you're fine with such a weakness."

Sofia: "Hahe, yes, weakness is disgusting."

Ridley: "Oh?"

Sofia: "But a player works best when they're emotionally attached to their goal."

Ridley: "Haha, of course."

Sofia: "Hahehahe."

--

Gabriel: "This is ironic-" *He staggered forward and dropped to his knees, speaking and appearing visibly upset.*

Riddle: "What's ironic?" *He took a step back, staring at Gabriel in a guilty manner.* (Is this my fault?)

Gabriel: "I did something terribly wrong."

Riddle: "What?"

Gabriel: "You know your experiment that you used to let me gain these powers?"

Riddle: "Y-Yes."

Gabriel: "Well, I wanted to surprise you by doing the same thing."

Riddle: "For what purpose?"

Gabriel: "By having your affinity use all four elements at once." *He whimpered in pain, gritting his teeth.*

Riddle: "When did you do these experiments?"

Gabriel: "Just before our confrontation with Raphael."

Riddle: "How, you had no time?"

Gabriel: "The reason why I was shocked when you told me about the affinity was because-, argh-" *He wheezed, noticing his fingers shake in a sickly manner.* "It kind of felt like you ruined the surprise."

Riddle: "Why? Experiments considered advanced are usually conducted by myself-"

Gabriel: "I thought I found the right formula, so I needed to test it. On my way to tell you, I found an Elementalist."

Riddle: "Really?"

Gabriel: "It worked-" *He coughed, looking up to Riddle.*

Riddle: "But?"

Gabriel: "Something overloaded the poor girl and she suddenly exerted aggressive-like behaviour."

Riddle: (Sounds like it must've altered the way her body responds to Neurons or Astragons if she responded in such a manner-)

Gabriel: "Her pupils dilated and completely turned into black. Before I had a chance to do anything, she fled."

Riddle: "Why didn't you tell me sooner?"

Gabriel: "I was embarrassed-"

Riddle: "Your embarrassment caused this woman-" *He noticed Gabriel struggle to breathe in exhaustion, causing his anger to subside.* "Okay, so why did you tell me now?"

Gabriel: "Something is burning inside."

Riddle: (What a coincidence that he wanted to surprise me with such a feat-) "Gabby, what symptoms are you-?"

Gabriel: "I don't think I'll make it."

Riddle: "Huh? Don't talk like that!"

Gabriel: "Ridz?" *He paused, glancing at Riddle in surprise.*

Riddle: "We haven't even diagnosed the condition or-"

Gabriel: *His fingers violently cracked backwards, causing Riddle to cover his mouth in shock.* "Argh!"

Riddle: (What is happening?!)

Gabriel: *His nose started to shrivel, as a gust of wind slowly began to swirl around him.* "Sorry-"

Riddle: "Sorry for-?!"

Gabriel: "Karh-" *His eye's golden shine faded, as it slowly started to glow an eerie yellow colour.*

Riddle: *He jumped back in fright, staring at his eyes with a dropping jaw.* (His eyes, they're not golden any more?!)

Gabriel: "Ridz, it hurts!" *His voice suddenly changed in tone.*

Riddle: *He took quick overwhelming breaths, trying to analyse the situation.* (His voice sounded odd like a Rosterology console from the research laboratory.)

Gabriel: "I-I, can't control my emotions?" *His face changed from anger to sadness to fear.*

Riddle: *He gasped and lowered his arms, scanning Gabriel with his eyes.* "I d-don't know what's happening."

Gabriel: *He hissed in pain, watching parts of his skin shed off his arms.* "My skin burns!"

Riddle: (His skin?! Are they scales?!) *He thought in terror, intensely staring at Gabriel's arms.*

Gabriel: "Ridz, you need to use the device to seal-" *He paused in mid-sentence, yelling in pain.*

Riddle: "The technique I used to subdue hurricanes?"

Gabriel: *He enthusiastically nodded his head in pain, watching his eyebrows sway to the ground.* (My eyebrows?!)

Riddle: "Gabby?"

Gabriel: *He ignored the loss of his eyebrows, looking at Riddle.* "I know you're smart enough to make quick adjustments to use it as a-"

Riddle: "As a barrier type seal." *He angrily shook his head, stamping his foot in frustration.* "I could, but stop talking like this-"

Gabriel: "Like-?"

Riddle: "Like you're done for!-"

Gabriel: "Look at me!" *He shouted and shoved his fingers in his face, watching them dislocated several times by themselves.*

Riddle: "I...-"

Gabriel: "Please, Ridz. I wouldn't ask anyone else."

Riddle: "A-As researchers, we know not to give up when things look grim-"

Gabriel: "And being a researcher I know what I'm talking about."

Riddle: "..."

Gabriel: *He squinted his eyes in pain, listening to sounds of bones cracking.* "I can already feel the aggression consuming my body."

Riddle: *He hesitantly nodded his head with watering eyes.* "Alright-" *He stood up straight and looked around, mumbling in thought.* "I'll need to find a good place-"

Gabriel: "In the cave." *He spoke in pain, as the winds around him grew stronger.*

*A strong gust of wind caused Riddle to slightly bend back, catching his attention.*

Riddle: *He stared at the wind, glancing at Gabriel.* (I only just realised, this sudden wind is Gabby's energy! The sheer level of his power is causing such a manifestation-)

Gabriel: "H-Hurry!-" *His eerie yellow eyes glowed brighter, as small rocks tumbled across the ground away from him.*

Riddle: *He noticed Gabriel's body slightly change shape.* (He doesn't have long-)

Gabriel: *He started to sweat, noticing the air warp around him.* "Ridz, something is building up."

Riddle: (That Elementalist he spoke about... If the same happens to him-)

Gabriel: "Argh!" *He yelled in pain, as a yellow vortex pulsed in a circular-like motion.*

Riddle: "Gah-"

*The force pushed Riddle across the ground, causing his eyes to glow a shade of yellow.*

Riddle: "Ouch-" *He applied pressure on his toes, causing him to stop.* "W-What was that?" *Darkness enveloped his body, causing his eyes to revert back to normal.*

Gabriel: "Argh!" *He shouted in agony, as the yellow vortex blew into the distance.*

-

*The yellow vortex pulsed through a thick forest and brushed past docile Scoldrants.*

Scoldrant: *A yellow-haired sloth-like Scoldrant dropped a handful of leaves and started to become aggressive.* "Grooeewuth!"

*Bird-like Scoldrants flapped from the treetops and violently screeched, diving towards other Scoldrants without the yellow eyes.*

Scoldrant: *A boar-like Scoldrant started to run away from the flock of aggressive bird-like Scoldrants, watching them fly after it.* "Oarrrrh."

-

*A school of fish-like Scoldrants with yellow eyes swam around a shark-like Scoldrant, slicing it with their fins.*

-

Gabriel: "Ridz, thank you."

Riddle: "Why are you thanking me?! Look what I've done to you!" *He grabbed Gabriel's arm, as tears ran down his face.*

Gabriel: "H-Here-" *He clicked his fingers, causing bright white light to blind Riddle.*

Riddle: "Ah-?" *He blinked and found himself deep inside the cave, causing him to look at Gabriel in shock.* (He can still teleport-?!)

Gabriel: "Ridz!"

Riddle: *He nodded his head and wasted no time, starting to prepare his experimental seal.* (I'm so sorry, Gabby!)

--

Sofia: (Wait? A cave? Experimental seals?) *She whispered in thought, glancing across the cave.*

Ridley: "It took nearly all I had to activate the glyphs without any preparation."

--

Gabriel: "Please hurry." *He groaned, as several differently coloured glyphs spiralled around him.*

Riddle: *He didn't respond to Gabriel, as he focused all his attention on the glyphs.* (I can't believe-)

Gabriel: *He watched layers of differently-sized glyphs draw themselves in the air and symbol-like glyphs appear on the cave walls and ground.* (I knew you could do it-)

Riddle: (I can't believe this is happening!-) *He sniffed and focused, watching the glyphs glow brighter.*

Gabriel: "Ridz." *He spoke softly, as if he knew this was his last moment.*

Riddle: "Y-Yes?"

Gabriel: "Continue our dream? Be it in this world or the next." *He smiled and a small prism-like glyph spiralled around his head, causing him to slowly fall into a deep slumber.*

Riddle: *Tears ran down his face.* "I will! I'll find a way to cure this weird reaction!" *His sad filled voice echoed throughout the cave.*

--

Sofia: "Ridley." *She spoke under her breath in shock, watching Ridley stare at her.* (I find weakness in a man very unattractive, but, it is different with Ridley.)

Ridley: "Sofia."

Sofia: "Yes?"

Ridley: *He took a step towards her, placing a hand on his chest.* "I love you, so I want to give you something."

Sofia: *She gasped, stepping back in shock.* (-.. Love?) "W-What?"

Ridley: "When I said I could trust you, it wasn't in general, but with something specific."

Sofia: (Specific?)

Ridley: "With what I'm about to do, it will give you powers that rivals my own."

Sofia: "Rivals?"

Ridley: "And that is what I can trust you with, knowing you are equal in power to me-"

Sofia: *She shook her head and ran up to Ridley, hugging him with a smile.* "I too can give you a gift!"

Ridley: "Are you ready?"

Sofia: *She nodded her head and stepped back, exhaling with emotion.* "Are you ready?"

Ridley: *He smirked with slight sadness due to the retelling of his flashback.* "Okay, I'm not sure what you're going to give me, but don't move-"

Sofia: (This wouldn't have been an option previously.) *She smirked and watched Ridley step forward, standing face to face with her.*

Ridley: *He took a deep, collective breath, watching shadow swirl around his body.* (Giving her my powers-)

*Darkness swirled in a watery-like stream, rippling away from Ridley and closer to Sofia.*

Sofia: *Golden sand streamed from her golden eyes, swirling towards Ridley.* (Giving him my powers-)

*The streams touched, causing them to violently swirl around each other.*

Ridley: *He watched the streams repel away from each other before they swirled into his eyes.* "Argh-"

Sofia: *Gold and black streams swirled into her eyes, causing her to gag in confusion.* "Gah-"

*A small force popped around their heads, causing them to step back and face palm in pain.*

Ridley: "W-What happened?" *He scrunched his eyes shut, applying pressure on his forehead.*

Sofia: "The darkness went into me?"

Ridley: "What was that golden stream-?" *He looked at Sofia in shock, causing him to stop in mid-sentence.*

Sofia: "W-What is it?" *She looked at Ridley, self consciously touching her cheek.*

Ridley: "Your eyes?"

Sofia: "What about them?" *Her eyes widened, revealing one eye black and the other golden.*

Ridley: "Your eyes are black and gold!" *The iris in one of his eyes dilated, as it slowly shined gold in colour.*

Sofia: "Your eye-?"

Ridley: "What an unusual feeling-" *He blinked in disorientation, as a swirl of shadow pulsed in his other eye, causing it to turn black.*

Sofia: "Your eyes are like that too!"

Ridley: "Wait? If we transferred our powers of equal and opposite magnitude, then it will cause severe damage on-" *He mumbled to himself, causing him to gasp with realisation.*

Sofia: "Ridley?"

Ridley: "We're temporarily going to experience tremendous pain."

Sofia: "Tssk..? No pain, no gain."

Ridley: "Not to sound childish, but I don't want you to see me like that."

Sofia: *She nodded her head in understanding.* "Me neither-" *Four flashsteps echoed behind her, causing her to turn around.*

Ridley: *He covered his eye that shined gold.* (I better make this quick, I'm already feeling a migraine-like headache coming along-) "I've been expecting you four for some time."

*The four warriors dropped to one knee, causing their amour to echo in the cave.*

?????: *A green-haired woman looked up to Ridley.* "On behalf of my comrades, we apologise."

Sofia: (The number ones.) *She smirked evil-like, licking her lips.*

Ridley: "You are forgiven, Pickles."

Pickles: "Sir." *She nodded her head, causing her green hair to fold over her forehead.*

Ridley: "I've awoken the four of you because I need you to confront certain party members, who consistently attempt to stop my plans."

?????: *A woman with silver hair with blue streaks twitched in shock.* "That is unforgivable, master!"

Ridley: "Dakota, I admire the respect, but I'm speaking."

Dakota: "Please forgive me." *She formed fists in a self-hatred-like manner, lowering her head in respect.*

Ridley: "I want you to take the time to search whoever you find first and defeat them."

?????: *A buff man with two large axes tied to his back, half smirked in confusion.* "Search for what?" *His deep voice caused Sofia to look at him.*

Ridley: "Brazza, I'll have Sofia show you the energy signatures in my absence."

Brazza: "..." *He flicked his head to move hair out of his face, looking away in a tough-like manner.*

?????: *A slender man with pale skin kept his head lowered, intensely staring at the ground.* "You're leaving?"

Ridley: "Hmm?" *He looked down, staring at the man intrigued.* "Yes, but I've seemed to have forgotten your name?"

?????: "Isaac, s-sir."

Ridley: "Dakota, Pickles, Brazza and Isaac, I'm entrusting you with this high priority mission-" *He walked past Sofia and the captains, as he made his way outside the cave.*

Sofia: *She looked past the captains, watching Ridley walk away.* (Ridley...)

Ridley: "Don't let me down." *He spoke with an echoing voice, before flashstepping out of the cave.*

Sofia: (Thank you for telling me your story-)

Brazza: "Ah hem?" *He rudely coughed, purposely catching Sofia's attention.*

Sofia: "Tssk." *She snapped out of her line of thought, glaring at Brazza annoyed.*

Brazza: "..."

Isaac: "Umm-" *He spoke with a frail voice, catching Sofia's attention.* "S-Sir spoke about us defeating people?"

Sofia: "Yes, you'll be their bosses, haheahe."

Pickles: "How will we find them?"

Sofia: *She closed her eyes and a runic stone materialised in her hand, catching the captains' attention.* "These are the Neuron signatures of those the Consultant is having troubles with-"

Dakota: "How did you manage to collect the signature of the unforgivable party members?"

Sofia: "He travelled with them and discreetly analysed their Neurons signatures."

----------

Ridley: *He flashstepped into another cave, causing his footsteps to echo.* "Phew-"

*Ridley took a deep and walked to the side of the cave, placing one hand on the damp wall.*

Ridley: (Gabby-) *He sighed in thought, looking down in an upset manner.* (I miss you.)

*A faint Scoldrant's roar echoed outside the cave, causing Ridley to snap out of his emotional train of thought.*

Ridley: (I promise I'll complete our dream.)

*Ridley stepped away from the wall and looked down the cave, listening to the sounds of the ocean outside.*

Ridley: (I must be showing signs of fatigue, I anticipated to flashstep directly to the divine entrance-) *He slowly inhaled and stepped forward, flashstepping further into the cave.*

*Sounds of dripping water echoed deep inside the cave and the walls were lit with a natural eerie green colour.*

Ridley: *He thought to himself in mid-flashstep, watching the walls move at high speeds past him.* (Concern's Gate. I've been making regular appearances in this cave-)

-

*The aura at the end of the cave responded to Ridley's presence, causing rainbow coloured lights to dance off the walls.*

-

Ridley: (It felt awkward but also a little satisfying telling Sofia about Gabriel-) *He ran around a bend and smirked, staring at a blurred rainbow-like shine ahead.*

----------

Sofia: (My stomach and throat are starting to feel strange-) *She walked past the captains, as all four had their eyes closed.* (I better go, showing signs of weakness means an instant game over for me.)

Pickles: (This energy signature is quite similar to mine.) *She smirked in thought, blowing mist out of her nostrils.*

Sofia: "You have no continues, so don't lose!" *She shouted with authority, flashstepping out of the cave.*

Brazza: (The freak finally left us.) *He half smirked in thought, keeping his eyes closed.*

Dakota: *Her eye twitched while mumbling in deep concentration.* (Searching for one of the Neuron signatures given to me-)

Brazza: (If the Consultant is so powerful, why doesn't he end these people himself?) *He grunted to himself, focusing his Neurons and Astragons.*

----------

Ridley: *He flashstepped in front of the rainbow coloured shield, causing a swirl of dirt to spiral around him.* (It was a risk giving Sofia the strength to rival my powers, but just as calculated-)

*Ridley smirked and stepped forward, reaching towards the holy aura.*

Ridley: (She gave me her Radiatons in return.)

*Ridley thought with hesitation, holding his hand directly in front of the aura.*

Ridley: (The colours move as if I'm no longer a threat?) *He reached forward and watched his hand go through the aura, causing him to gasp with a dropping jaw.* (This is it...)

*Ridley stepped back with a widening smile, looking at his hand with shock and disbelief.*

Ridley: "I better wait for the effects of the Radiatons to fully merge into my body-" *He mumbled to himself, grinning at the aura.* "It will be painful, but I don't care right now."

Chapter 2: Holland's Tale

*Keno and Holland walked through a gloomy forest, scaling up a massive mountain.*

Keno: *He looked up and stared at thick clouds, which caused the area to seem like dusk.* (He's been quiet for quite sometime.) *He mumbled to himself, as Holland slowly followed him from behind.*

*The fireball-like Scoldrants slowly floated around Keno and Holland, keeping the area lit.*

Holland: "It feels like a part of me has died-"

Keno: *He walked into a clearing and stopped, observing his surroundings.* "Holland."

Holland: "..."

Keno: "Perhaps these strong emotions have clouded your basic knowledge." *He placed his hands on his waist, leaning back in pain.*

Holland: "What are you talking about-?"

Keno: "That's something you need to figure out for yourself." *He sighed and shook his head, slowly facing away.* (The Sacred Rostic Tribe is up near the peak.)

Holland: "Keno?" *He looked at Keno, watching him stare up towards the mountain's top.*

Keno: (It gets darker the further up the mountain we go, perhaps keeping my summonses active-)

Holland: "Keno."

Keno: "Holland, you will learn a lot about our kind-"

Holland: "Don't I already?" *He sighed with sadness, trying to suppress his emotions.*

Keno: "Yes and no. You'll know more, but that's if you're granted to do the pilgrimage."

Holland: "If I'm granted? Why can't you just tell me what you know-?"

Keno: "Come on, we can talk as we walk." *He kept a fixated stare on the mountain's peak, slowly hobbling up the slope towards it.*

Holland: *He jogged with a bounce towards Keno, looking at him in confusion.* "What pilgrimage? What's a pilgrimage?"

Keno: *He smirked, chuckling in his old brittle-like voice.* "Heh."

Holland: "What's so funny?"

Keno: "You."

Holland: "Me?" *He watched the fireball-like Scoldrants continue their perfectly timed circles, continuously providing light in the area.*

Keno: "You've exceeded over top-classed Scoldrant Users, and yet, you hardly know anything about us. I find it funny."

Holland: "Well, you've got a weird sense of humour."

Keno: "You already knew that."

Holland: *He awkwardly smiled and sniffed, scratching the back of his head.* "Umm, yeah."

Keno: "Good to feel you're a little better now."

Holland: "What are you talking about? That didn't make any sense? How would you know what I feel?"

Keno: "You're definitely still filled with sorrow-"

Holland: "How-?!"
Keno: "-Nature was telling me how you were feeling." *He purposely interrupted Holland.*

Holland: *He gave Keno a strange look, shaking his head in confusion.* "Wha-?"

*Keno nudged his head downwards, causing Holland to notice glowing vegetation around his feet.*

Holland: (The environment-)

Keno: "And a pilgrimage is something like a journey."

Holland: "Just another word for a journey?" *He looked behind him, noticing they were high up on the mountain, past the canopy level of the forest below.*

Keno: "And your journey, pilgrimage, finishes at the end. It's like a test to prove one's self."

Holland: "Oh." *He sounded as if he didn't care.*

Keno: *He leant forward and moaned, as the mountain became steeper.* "Holland-" *He accidentally knocked a rock, causing it to tumble down the slope and into the forest behind him.* "What do you want?"

Holland: *He glanced across the mountain in thought, staring at old grassy clumps in several ditches.* (What do I want? Hot babes with nice curves? No.. Maybe what Freya and I wanted to do-)

Keno: "Holland?"

Holland: (I just realised, we stopped pursuing our goal when this yellow-eyed disease started corrupting Guardians-) *He nodded his head and looked at Keno.* "I want to find the firebird Scoldrant."

Keno: "The legendary firebird?"

Holland: *He nodded his head again, looking at Keno in a serious manner.* "It was what me and Freya were going to do."

Keno: *He smiled and focused his attention back to the peak, enthusiastically stepping over several ditches.* (What a coincidence.) "We're almost there."

Holland: *He looked up, noticing a white full moon in the eerie blue sky.* "Why is the moon full?! Why is it full already? The Rubistral!-" *He gasped and started to panic, catching Keno's attention.*

Keno: "I'm not sure why that would cause you to panic, look behind you."

Holland: *He looked over his shoulder and past thick clouds in the sky, noticing a second moon.* (Another moon-?)

*A loud wolf-like howl caught Holland's attention, causing him to look back towards the peak in a curious manner.*

Keno: "Don't be alarmed, it wasn't a wolf-"

Holland: "I-It was a howl but it spoke?"

Keno: "No one spoke, it was a howl-"

Holland: "He said hello?" *He spoke to himself as if Keno was an idiot, looking around in confusion.*

Keno: *He glanced at Holland with widening eyes.* (He could understand what that man said?)

Holland: "That was weird."

Keno: *He held his throat and the fireball Scoldrants suddenly disintegrated, causing the area to seem much darker.* (So by that howl, I think they know we're here.)

Holland: *He grew bored trying to find where the howl came from, focusing his attention on Keno.* "You asked me, now I'll ask you. What are you doing here, Keno?"

Keno: *He walked around large pillars of rock, which rested horizontally across the mountain.* "When I bumped into you at The Twilight Forest, I told you I'm trying to find the tribe."

Holland: *He sniffed, nodding his head in recollection.* "Yeah, I remember that."

Keno: "I finally found their location-"

Holland: "How?"

Keno: "It's not really import-" *He noticed Holland's interested face, causing him to sigh with a smile.* "Through the environment and Scoldrants."

Holland: "Oh, awesome." *He mumbled, slightly smiling with sadness.* "Why do you want to see them?"

Keno: "I need to ask them how to stop the yellow-eyed disease from spreading." *He looked up and paused, before frowning with determination.* (Almost there.)

Holland: (That's similar to my mission, to find out why several of the Guardians had yellow eyes.)

*Keno and Holland stopped at the peak of the mountain.*

Keno: "Word has gotten around about a mass Scoldrant purge."

Holland: "Purge?"

Keno: "Think about it." *He sounded upset, as his tribal-like markings glowed through his clothing.*

Holland: (A purge...?) *He paused in thought and gasped, exhaling in realisation.* (That's disgusting!) *He frowned and formed tightening fists.*

Keno: (This is a tricky Reality Sekai to open-) *He watched the air warp in front of him, as it reacted to his markings.* "As part of your family, please let us in!"

Holland: (Why should innocent Scoldrants take blame for what the others have done?) *He gritted his teeth, as images of violent yellow-eyed Scoldrants flashed in his mind.* (And the ones at fault are not fully to blame!)

*The air swirled and opened like a portal, as two human-sized ladybug-like Scoldrants flew past.*

Keno: (A Spacial Funnel...?)

Holland: "..." *He looked down to his feet, frowning in thought.*

Keno: (I can hear your thoughts, go play-) "Shine!" *A glyph formed in the air above him and a ladybug-like Scoldrant flew out of it.*

Shine: "Woooshiiish." (Thank you.) *It thought with appreciation and flew after the other two Scoldrants in a playful manner.*

Keno: "Holland Breeze." *He spoke with authority and glanced at Holland, before walking into the portal.*

Holland: *He looked up and scratched his chin, watching Keno warp out of his sight.* "Ah, right." *He spoke with respect and slight anger due to his previous thought, stepping into the Spacial Funnel.*

--

Keno: *He watched the area warp around him, feeling gusts of wind gently waft to each side.* (It's dark-)

*The winds intensified and swirled into a blue wave-like image, before blowing past Keno and Holland, causing them to close their eyes.*

Holland: (What an unusual Spacial Funnel!-)

--

Keno: *He stepped on ground and slowly opened his eyes, sighing in relief.* "We passed through the Spacial Funnel."

Holland: "Ah-" *He slowly opened his eyes, glancing at Keno.*

Keno: *He stared in front, mumbling to himself in confusion.* (Is this it? Are we finally here?)

Holland: (Freya, sniff any abnormal scents and-) *He looked down and paused with realisation, sighing with lowering morale.*

Keno: "After a very long walk, we're finally here."

*Holland and Keno stood on the outskirts of what appeared to be a village.*

Holland: *He took a deep breath and ignored his feelings, leaning towards Keno.* "Was that a Spacial Funnel? I've been through Reality Sekai's more smoother than that."

Keno: *He faced Holland, ignoring his question.* "I'm sure you will be understanding, but don't make a fuss when you see their appearance."

Holland: "Ah, sure?"

*Howls, growls and chatter echoed from the village, catching Holland's attention.*

Holland: "Huh-?"

Keno: "You're like a baby, let's go."

Holland: "Baby? What did I do?"

Keno: (Asking baby things, like if that was a Spacial Funnel..) "Are you coming?" *He spoke in a baby-like manner, slowly walking ahead.*

Holland: *He sighed, slightly annoyed, rolling his eyes with a smirk.* "Coming."

*Keno and Holland cautiously walked to the entrance of the village, noticing old wooden houses ring around the village.*

Holland: (Those houses look as old as Keno!) *He thought in a playful manner, thinking of Lance.*

Keno: *He continued to observe his surroundings, noticing a large rocky cliff poke out on the ledge of the mountain they stood on.* (We must be up fairly high-)

*Hill mounds which contained cave entrances, circled in between the wooden houses and around the outskirts of the village.*

Holland: (This place-)

Keno: (This village is well lit by the bright moonlight-) "Holland-" *He mumbled, slowly staggering into the village.*

*An enormous campfire caught Holland's attention, noticing a ring of tribe members lying on the ground around it.*

Keno: *He watched human-shaped figures move past the fire, as several tribe members made their way to the other side of the village.* (There they are-)

Holland: "This reminds me of home."

Keno: (Home?) *He looked at Holland, sighing in a guilty manner.* "You're meant to prove how good you're going to get, so you can come back to the village?"

Holland: *Keno's words triggered a flashback of when he revealed Freya for the first time.* "R-Right." *He paused and lowered his head, catching Keno's attention.*

Keno: "Hmm?"

Holland: "No." *He spoke under his breath, slowly shaking his head.*

Keno: "Excuse me?"

Holland: "How am I meant to do that-" *He looked up, staring at Keno with emotion.* "-Without Freya-?"

?????: "Whoa, back down, bitch! I'm here to help you out, hey."

Keno: "Who-?"

Holland: "That voice sounds familiar." *He mumbled to himself, looking towards the commotion.*

Blake: *He leant on one side and appeared frustrated, staring at a man with a wolf's face.* "The nerve! You unsexy animal."

Holland: (Him?) *He stormed towards Blake, puffing out his chest.*

Blake: "Pfft! If my info ain't good enough-" *He folded his arms.* "Then I'll take my leave!"

Holland: *He stopped and stood tall as if he monitored the situation.* "Is everything good here?"

Blake: *He turned around and noticed Holland, giving him a feral look.* "Oh, one of PKMY's friends." *He hissed in a condescending manner, before glaring back at the tribesman.* "And my info is important, hey!"

Tribesman: "I told you, the chief needs to know about this-"

?????: "Gerowh-"

*A growl suddenly caused the entire village to stop making sounds, drawing their attention to the cave-like entrances.*

Keno: (The chief-)

Holland: (What's going on?) *He looked to his side, watching a large figure shuffle from a cave towards him.*

Blake: (He's larger than I thought.) *He stopped his loud-like behaviour, silently staring at the figure with anticipation.*

Keno: (I hope this goes well-)

Blake: "That's the leader-" *He hissed, glancing at the wolf-faced man in disgust.* "I thought you said he wasn't seeing anyone-"

Chief: *He continued to walk forward and stepped into the moonlight, revealing he had a fox's face and was covered in thick, bronze fur.* "I feel the presence of a tribe leader."

Keno: "That would be me." *He walked closer, drawing the chief's attention.*

Chief: "What brings you to The Sacred Rostic Tribe?" *He spoke with respect and authority.*

Blake: "Who's the old geezer?"

Holland: "That's Keno. Show him respect."

Blake: "Fufufu, my respect is earned, not given." *He rolled his eyes as if he didn't care.*

Keno: "I am here to share information regarding-"

Chief: "The disease that threatens our ecosystem, our fellow Scoldrants, and even our well-being?"

Blake: "Say whaa?"
Keno: "You're exactly right." *He hid his surprise.*

Chief: *He tilted his head up, causing his fox-like eyes to shine in the moonlight.* "And who is your companion?"

Blake: *He looked up and stared at the moon, admiring the faint rings of light around it.* (Does he know why I'm here?) *He looked back down, staring at Keno.* (Or is that old geezer here for a similar reason?)

Keno: "Ho-"

Holland: "Holland Breeze, pleased to meet your acquaintance." *He lowered his head in respect.*

Chief: "Hickhick." *He chuckled in an animal-like manner.* "I like this one, you've brought him up well."

Holland: *He looked at the chief, scratching behind his head with a modest smile.* "Thank you."

Chief: "And who is this one? Causing discomfort in my tribe?" *He looked at Blake with twitching whiskers.*

Blake: "Blake-" *He spoke with a hiss and stepped forward.* "I'm here to tell you information about the demon."

Chief: "Demon?" *He growled and pinched his whiskers, pulling on them with growing curiosity.*

Blake: (Not even talking about The Rostical Guild, but.. Should I reveal the information that Cam, like, told me?)

Keno: "Blake was it?"

Blake: *He noticed the tribesman, Keno, Holland and the chief looking at him, causing him to nervously cough.* "Cam-, I mean-, the ex-number one captain found the Consultant's databanks and there was, like, an entry regarding an experiment."

Chief: "Experiment?"

Holland: (Why would the number one hang around him?) *He thought in a condescending manner, glancing at Blake.*

Blake: *He placed a hand on his waist, nodding his head to the chief.* "Yea, an experiment which caused the yellow-eyed disease."

Chief: "What is this experiment?"

Blake: *He paused as if he felt guilty revealing the information.* "We were in a rush, but it was something to do with affinities."

Holland: *He folded his arms, taking the time to observe the village in detail.* (Huh?) *His eyes widened as he noticed all the tribal members were animal-like in appearance.*

Tribesman: *He walked away from Blake and towards the chief.* "Please don't let them be a distraction, let us go on the pilgrimage and obtain the summoning!"

Chief: "Let me ask the spirits for advice, leave me be for now." *He turned around and started to walk towards the large cliff.*

Blake: *He raised his eyebrows, staring at the chief's back in an unimpressed manner.* (Sure, just walk off like that. Are you, like, serious? Wat an unsexy bear.)

Tribesman: (What are those disgusting people doing in our village?!) *He tightened his fists and gritted his teeth in anger, showing his wolf-like teeth.*

Blake: *He sighed and rolled his eyes, glancing at the village.* (What a rank village, smells like a barnyard-)

Tribesman: *He slowly spun around, discreetly looking at Holland, Keno and Blake.* (I'm so angry these people can flush our kind into hiding just because of our appearance.)

Blake: (So, they won't help me? I made it all the way here for no reason?) *He thought to himself with growing emotion.* (Fine then!) "Pfft, Scoldrant Users..." *He glanced at the village in a judgemental manner, readying to turn around.* "Having feral animals for a best friend, that's pretty pathetic-"

Holland: *He grabbed Blake by the scruff, slamming him against the side of a wooden house.* "What are you doing here?"
Blake: "Yuck-" *He choked out the word.*

Holland: "You heard me!"

Blake: *He quickly got over his initial shock, looking up to Holland with an emotionless face.* "Why do you care?"

Holland: "Why do you care? You don't even have a Soul Linked partner!"

Blake: *He frowned and formed fists.* "I don't want one-"

Holland: *He paused and forcefully let go of Blake, staring at him with emotion.* "What did you say?"

Blake: "Who needs a feral animal? I certainly wouldn't want one following me around all the time-"

Holland: *He leant forward, suddenly punching Blake across the face.* "You're disgusting." *He uttered in anger and turned around, walking back towards Keno.*

Blake: *He held his face in shock, staring at Holland's back with a dropping jaw.* (That bastard.)

Keno: *He looked up to Holland with a wise face.* "Was that appropriate?"

Holland: "..."

Keno: "Holland, you've tagged along completely uncertain about what you're getting yourself into." *His frail voice sounded worried, catching Holland's attention.*

Holland: "What are you talking about?"

Keno: "You're going to go on a pilgrimage."

Holland: "I am? Since when?"

Keno: "You will find the answers you seek, if you make it."

Holland: *He shook his head in confusion, leaning forward as if he wanted to know more.* "If I make it?"

Keno: "It's very dangerous."

Holland: *He paused and looked down, scraping his foot back and forth in the dirt.* "So?"

Keno: *He smiled.* "The answers you seek will be found in the pilgrimage."

Holland: "..."

Keno: "Trust me."

Holland: (Keno's smart... He knows whatever is wrong, or what actually happened to Freya, will be answered in his trial thing.)

*Holland looked at Keno, scratching behind his head with contemplation.*

Holland: "I'm not afraid."

Keno: "Good." *He closed his eyes with a smile, as if he considered the conversation over.*

Holland: "So-" *He mumbled and spun in a circle, observing the village.* "The villagers don't seem to care we're here."

Keno: "..."

Holland: *He unintentionally stared at their dark figures, due to the poor lighting.* "They're just lazying around, or-"

Keno: "I can feel their emotions, they are very powerful."

Holland: "How powerful?"

Keno: "Does it matter?"

Holland: "..."

Keno: (But, I'd guess their power is close to vice-captain level.)

Chief: *He stood on the edge of the cliff with his eyes closed, slowly raising his arms.* (I understand your thoughts completely-)

*The chief looked down and noticed three eagles standing at the ledge of the cliff.*

Chief: "Thank you for your knowledge." *He turned around, causing the eagles to flap away and into the air.*

Blake: *He watched the chief slowly walk back into the village, rolling his eyes in disgust.* (I just wanna get out of here. I can't believe I let those stupid idiots convince me to do this!)

Keno: *He opened his eyes and tilted his head, watching the chief walk up to the tribesman.* "..."

Blake: *He placed one hand on his waist and shook his head.* (Nah.. My sexy spice and the cripple are just tryna help me out. I'm.. Being a bully right now, hey-)

Chief: "I have spoken with the Guardians, and they have let me know-" *He paused, watching the wolf-like man growl in suspense.*

Tribesman: "Yes?"

Chief: "That the path has opened."

Tribesman: *He growled in excitement.* "S-So, I can go?!"

Blake: "Aye? What has opened?"

Tribesman: *He rolled his eyes, gritting his canine-like teeth.* "Well-"

Chief: "Sebastian, your strong will to go on the pilgrimage has served you well-"

Sebastian: "Yes!" *He punched downwards in excitement.*

Holland: "It's opened?" *He mumbled to himself in confusion, staring at Sebastian.*
Keno: "..."

Sebastian: "Great, I'm off! I'll be back with the wishing phoenix feather." *He turned around, facing the exit of the village.*

Chief: "Wait. I won't let you go alone."

Sebastian: "Seriously?" *He slouched, facing the chief.*

Blake: "Fufufu." *He rubbed his hands together.* "Wait, does that mean I can go to this thing now?"

Chief: *He observed Blake, noticing the slight glow on the ground around his feet.* (He is strong.) "Yes-"

Blake: "Bitch, please." *He pretended not to care, smirking in a victorious manner.*

Keno: "Oh, and could Holland go, too?" *He stared at the chief, discreetly pushing Holland forward.*

Holland: "Ah, yeah?"

Chief: (He too is powerful.) *He observed Blake and Holland, growling in thought.* (Holland appears to only have three summons and a Soul Linked partner, while the other focuses on the diversity of summons and his own skills.)

Sebastian: "I can go by myself-"

Chief: "The three of you are to go."

Holland: *He looked around and stared at the other tribe members, scratching the side of his face in confusion.* "Just the three of us?"

Chief: "It is a dangerous pilgrim, you three are to work together! Go now."

Blake: (Wait? Why am I suddenly going on a pilgrimage?!) *He rolled his eyes and shook his head in an annoyed manner, rubbing his cheek in slight pain.*

Sebastian: *He nodded his head, glancing at Blake and Holland with a bored expression.* "Let's go then." *He started to walk away, catching Blake's attention.*

Blake: "Watevs."

Holland: *He stood on the spot, watching Blake and Sebastian leave the village.* "What-?"

Chief: (Sebastian, you're underestimating the danger that awaits you.)

Blake: *He glanced at the chief.* "I wanted to chat to ya, hey."

Chief: "Your question will be answered at the pilgrimage."

Blake: *He walked backwards allowing him to face the chief while walking away.* "You don't know wat I-"

Chief: "Your partner."

Blake: *He hissed with widening eyes.* (Why does everyone know wat I want already?)

Keno: "Go." *He walked past Holland towards the chief, as if he was going to talk to him.* (Good luck, Holland.)

Chief: (Sebastian, you're underestimating the danger that awaits you.)

Holland: "Ah?" *He mumbled in a deep voice, jogging after Blake and Sebastian.*

Chief: "So, I suppose you want to talk?" *He sounded welcoming.*

Keno: "Yes."

Chief: "This way." *He opened his hand, facing one of the caves.*

Blake: *He looked confused and watched the chief and Keno face one of the caves.* (So.. I'm really going on, like, an unsexy pilgrimage now?)

Sebastian: *He frowned and stepped outside the village as his face started to warp inwards, revealing a man's head.* (I won't let my tribe down. I'll obtain the information from our ancestors and I'll obtain the power to protect us from the yellow-eyed disease.)

----------

*Blake, Holland and Sebastian walked down the mountain's slope towards a forest, ignoring the twinkling stars in the calm night sky.*

Holland: *He awkwardly walked in between Blake and Sebastian, glancing to each side.* "So-"

Blake: "Shut it-"

Sebastian: "You both shut up. Don't talk and we will all get along fine-" *He growled, stroking hair-like whiskers.*

Blake: "Grouchy, hey." *He rolled his eyes at Sebastian.*

Sebastian: "I could've done this myself."

Blake: "Pfft." *He glared at Sebastian, hissing to himself in an offended manner.*

Holland: *He rolled his eyes, scratching his arm in thought.* (No matter who I was with, I'd never feel alone with you by my side... Freya.) *He looked down to his feet as if he was expecting Freya to be walking by his side.*

*Howls echoed from the peak of the mountain, causing Sebastian to smile.*

Sebastian: (I won't let you down.)

Blake: "Oi." *He strutted over several ditches, looking to his side at Holland.*

Holland: "What?" *He sounded annoyed at Blake as he stepped on levelling ground towards a forest.*

Blake: "Nothing." *He looked away, walking into the forest.*

Holland: "Umm, hey, guy?" *He mumbled to Sebastian.*

Sebastian: *He sighed.* "What?"

Holland: "Back there, everyone looked like an animal-"

Sebastian: *He suddenly stopped, aggressively facing Holland.* "What about it? Huh?"

Holland: "Whoa, back down, I have no problem with what they look like." *He raised his hands, waving them in an innocent manner.*

Blake: *He sighed to himself.* (I know wat it feels like. I want to be nice to that unsexy Sebastian guy, but it almost feels embarrassing in a way, it's weird.)

Sebastian: *He noticed Holland's sincerity, causing his anger to slowly fade away.* "Sorry-" *He quickly turned away and continued walking.*

Blake: *He quietly observed Sebastian, following him in a mature manner.* (I can understand what he felt then.. He just didn't have to be a dick the moment I saw him.)

Sebastian: *He ducked under a tree branch as he continued to walk through the forest.* "What we look like-"

Holland: "I'm actually a little insulted you think I would discriminate on appearance."

Sebastian: *He paused in response and focused his attention on moving around the terrain.* "Sorry, I've had some negative experiences involving my appearance."

Blake: *He glanced at Sebastian.* "There's nothing wrong with you, well, except the fugly clothes you wear."

Holland: "Speaking about appearances, I noticed you look like a human?"

Sebastian: "With Astragons, we can suppress our appearance."

Holland: *He closely inspected Sebastian, nodding his head in understanding.* "I can see the slight Scoldrant traits in you still-"

Blake: "Yeah, you had a wolf's face before, now it's normal?"

Sebastian: "Normal?" *He frowned, giving Blake a feral look.* "I don't want to talk about it."

Holland: "Don't stress." *He shrugged his shoulders, casually placing his hands on the back of his head.*

Sebastian: "It will take a few hours to get to our destination."

Holland: "Where are we going?"

Blake: "You don't know anything, tssk." *He rolled his eyes, noticing the ground and environment glow green around their footsteps.*

----------

*The chief and Keno sat on a dirt ground in the middle of an underground cave.*

Chief: *He swayed his hand in the dirt, watching it glow green around his fingertips.* "Well-" *He spoke with suspense, closing his eyes.*

Keno: "Hmm?"

Chief: "They're getting along already."

Keno: "Holland can get along with anyone."

Chief: "Anyone?"

Keno: "Well, he doesn't get too close to just anyone."

Chief: (He seems like a heart-warming fellow-) *He concentrated and opened his eyes, looking at Keno.* "The pilgrimage will test his might."

Keno: "Yes.."

Chief: "Hickhick-" *He chuckled with a distinctive animal-like growl.* "Do you remember yours?"

Keno: "I nearly died twice." *He smiled, staring at the chief with anticipation.*

Chief: "Three times, hickhick." *He purred, as he brushed himself under his chin.* "Where is your companion?"

Keno: *He licked his lips, mumbling in recollection.* "I encountered two Ancioldrants."

Chief: "Two? What happened?"

Keno: "Kosmo, our Soul Link was at its peak, so we could've defeated the Ancioldrants with all our might."

Chief: *He shook his head, as if defeating them wouldn't have been an option.* "Yes?"

Keno: "So we disabled them, at a cost of losing Kosmo's physical form."

Chief: "Why be upset? We know what you can do."

Keno: "I know, but at my old age, it will take a very long time."

Chief: "I see, did the same thing happen to your companion?"

Keno: "Similar, but Holland's companion sacrificed herself in order to keep him alive."

Chief: *He shook his head.* (She sacrificed herself..? And it's moments like that people conveniently turn a blind eye for. Accepting Scoldrants is too easy apparently, yet Scoldrants lived on this land way before humans emerged.)

Keno: *He observed the chief's sudden deep in thought-like stare.* (I have no idea what he's thinking, but I feel like I can agree with him.)

----------

*Holland followed Blake and Sebastian through a flat terrain, surrounded by thick tall trees.*

Sebastian: "For the last time, we're heading West to Turnback Cave."

Blake: (Turnback Cave? Isn't that where Rachael is going? Will I see her there?) *He paused and looked confused.* (Why did I just get excited then? I want to show them I'm not a bully, but I shouldn't be, like, getting excited over it.)

Sebastian: "Happy?" *He growled at Blake as if he was tired of being pestered by him.*

Blake: "Why there?"

Sebastian: *He rolled his eyes, causing Blake to roll his eyes in response.* "Because that's where Guelalia Cranners is."

Blake: (The volcanic catacombs.) "It's not like I was told anyfing, hey."

Holland: (What are they talking about?) *He sighed to himself, silently watching them bicker to each other.* (But I won't bother asking, they'll just be annoying..)

Sebastian: *He stepped around a thick tree, walking ahead of Blake and Holland.* "What are you two doing here anyway?"

Blake: "Pretty sure your chief asked us to, aye."

Sebastian: "No, you could've easily said no."

Holland: "To be honest I don't have a clue, I respect Keno's wisdom-"

Blake: "Who is Keno?" *He hissed.*

Sebastian: "Obviously the old man he was with." *He grunted.*

Holland: "Yeah."

Sebastian: "You guys are Scoldrant Users, so where are your partners?"

Blake: *He paused with a frown in response to Sebastian's question.* "..."
Holland: "Ah...?"

Sebastian: *He growled with a sigh.* "I didn't want to talk to either of you, and when I do, you don't say anything."

Holland: ".. My partner passed away recently." *He spoke under his breath as if it was a struggle to say.*

Sebastian: (What?) *He growled in thought in shock.*
Blake: (His what?) *He looked surprised, slightly missing a step.*

*The sounds of the leaves rustling in the wind could be heard and eagles squawking in the distance echoed several times.*

Blake: *He noticed Sebastian looking at him.* "Mine apparently didn't want to be my partner and ran away."

Sebastian: *His eyes widened in shock.* "Oh.."

Blake: "..." (I bet he feels like an ass now.)

Holland: (I feel pretty awkward.) *He awkwardly coughed, scratching the side of his head.* "So, want to shed some light on this pilgrim we're going on?"

Blake: (Yeah, I want to know too.)

Sebastian: (They don't have a clue. As to be expected from outsiders-)

Blake: "Aye? So we're going onna silent pilgrim quest thing?"

Sebastian: *He sighed, looking at Holland.* "The pilgrimage varies between classes."

Holland: "Classes?"

Blake: "Like strength wise?"

Sebastian: "No, like Scoldrant Users, Rostical Users, Sacred Dancers, Singers-"

Blake: "We get it."

Holland: (Keno mentioned something like that before.)

Sebastian: "Well, like The Rostical Trials, our variant of the pilgrimage, tests our power and makes us stronger if we succeed."

Blake: *He sighed with boredom, playing with his hair in a feminine manner.* "..."

Holland: "Oh-" *He clicked his fingers in recollection, walking slightly faster to catch up to Sebastian.* "That reminds me."

Sebastian: "Hmm?"

Holland: "Why weren't any of the tribe members excited to see us, or excited for the pilgrimage? And why send only three of us?"

Sebastian: "There are several reasons. One would be, even though there are heaps of Scoldrant Users scattered across each continent, we're the last type of our kind."

Holland: "Oh, fair enough."

Sebastian: "You guys said earlier that I looked normal."

Blake: *Sebastian's words drew his attention to the conversation.* (Hmm? I didn't mean it to sound so, like.. Sassy, hey.)

Sebastian: "My fellow tribe members weren't excited for us, because the survival rate of the pilgrimage is very low."

Blake: "How low?"

Sebastian: "..." *He continued to walk forward, as if he knew exactly where to go.*

Holland: "Well, how low?"

Sebastian: "Twenty members left for the pilgrimage, only one came back."

Blake: "One?" *He hissed to himself, covering his mouth in disbelief.*

Holland: "Who?"

Sebastian: "The chief."

Blake: "Rite.." *He hissed under his breath.*

Sebastian: *He observed Holland and Blake, growling to himself in a curious manner.* (Nobody told them? They really intend to do this pilgrimage blind? Either way, they aren't running away.)

Blake: *He frowned with anxiety, brushing his fingers through his hair.* (Shit.)

Holland: (The odds are against us!)

Blake: (This was like, totes, not planned. Did that cripple already know?)

Sebastian: "I'll be doing this to get rid of this disease that corrupts all of our brethren."

Blake: "Uhm, like I said, you don't hafta worry about that. The guild is, like, onto it, hey."

Sebastian: "What was this about the yellow-eyed disease?"

----------

Keno: "Only you returned?!"

Chief: *He grunted, nodding his head in response.* "I was the only one who could summon though, so I had another set of allies to aid me."

Keno: "What happened to the others?"

Chief: "Several died merely due to the lack of connection they had with the environment."

Keno: (The environment?)

Chief: "Others couldn't get over their emotional confrontations and died."

Keno: (They died because they couldn't face their emotional confrontations? I don't remember dealing with that-)

Chief: "Others had trouble releasing their Scoldrant powers-" *He paused, purring in thought.* "And we actually had three Scoldrant Users from your tribe with us."

Keno: "Oh?" *He sounded interested, looking up in recollection.* "I vaguely remember our neighbouring village, they sent several of their top class Scoldrant Users on the pilgrimage, they didn't return."

Chief: *He nodded his head again for confirmation.* "Their Soul Links broke, which caused them to die."

Keno: (Their Soul Links broke?) *He remained silent with a curious expression on his face.* "The pilgrimage I took focused on a perfect Soul Link."

Chief: "..."

Keno: ".. I know there are slight differences in each pilgrim, but what kind of pilgrimage is the current one?"

Chief: "The legendary trial of course?" *He spoke in confusion, as if he thought Keno already knew.*

Keno: *He gasped with widening eyes.* "Are you telling me I sent Holland on a death wish?!" *He stood up in shock, slightly angry at himself.* "What a fool! I wanted him to learn about it, not experience it first-hand!-"

Chief: "..."

Keno: *He swayed his hand and two Summonce Scarbras materialised in his palm.* "I will go-"

Chief: "This is better for Holland." *He remained calm, watching Keno ready himself to leave.*

Keno: "With all due respect, I don't see how this would be better for him-"

Chief: "It seems you hold Holland close to you, so-"

Keno: *He ignored the chief and focused, causing the Summonce Scarbras to glow.* "We need to-"

Chief: "I know you're very powerful, but we both know Holland is nothing without his companion. Surely you of all people can relate to that right now?"

Keno: *He looked at the chief, shaking his head.* "But-"

Chief: "Besides, two of three can summon. Sebastian is also one of the few tribe members who fully understands the Scoldrant in him."

Keno: "Meaning what?"

Chief: "He is no push over. Please sit back down, and let's hear what the environment says about their journey?" *He stared at the Summonce Scarbras, motioning his hand towards the ground.*

Keno: (I suppose the massive power boost would serve Holland well-) *He sighed, causing the pearls to disintegrate into the air.* (And what the chief mentioned, Holland is better off doing this.)

----------

Blake: *He sighed as if he didn't want to talk.* "Apparently defeating the demon will stop the yellow-eyed syndrome."

Sebastian: (A creature is the reason for all this destruction? Why would a Scoldrant do this to its own kind?)

Blake: "So-" *He strutted beside Sebastian and looked ahead.* "What's the point in going through all this?"

Sebastian: "The Scoldrants that have been affected for some time will not be cured when or if the source is destroyed."

Blake: "Say whaa?" *He hissed in shock.* (Does that mean that those losers are doing watevs they're doing for noffing?!)

Holland: (Demon? It feels like I'm missing something here.)

Blake: "Then what do you plan to do about it?"

Sebastian: "Obvious? Use the feather to summon something to help us."

Blake: "What if there isn't a summon-?"

Sebastian: "There will be!"

Holland: *He slightly walked behind Sebastian and Blake, scratching his facial hair in confusion.* (There's definitely something else going on.)

Blake: "How y'know though?"

Sebastian: "We've been talking to the environment across the lands for some time. We know."

Blake: "Pfft, I'll be defeating the demon with my bitches so I don't care what y'know, hey."

Holland: (The demon.. The strange condition.. It feels like, if I didn't encounter Ashton, Lance and Alicia, I would've ended up finding this demon they keep talking about.)

Sebastian: "Don't disrespect my words."

Blake: *He giggled with a hiss, rolling his eyes at Sebastian.* (He obnoxiously ignored my realistic thoughts of this pilgrimage's outcome-) *He paused in mid-thought.* (Realistic? I'm starting to sound like those losers Nathan and Rachael.)

Holland: *He grunted as if he was about to talk.* "So-"

*A growl croaked from the treetops, causing Holland to look up puzzled.*

Holland: "..." *He walked in front of Sebastian and Blake, looking at the branches with heightened vision.*

Blake: "Wat are ya doing?"
Sebastian: "Man?"

Holland: "Huh?"

Blake: *He looked up towards the branches.* "A Scoldrant?"

Sebastian: "I don't sense-"

Scoldrant: "Graith."

Sebastian: "Huh-?!" *His eyes widened in shock.*

*A sabre-toothed Scoldrant jumped down from the treetops, suddenly slashing Holland across the shoulder.*

Sebastian: (It's a strong beast type!-)
Blake: "Fufufu.. Bitch, really?"

Holland: "Argh-" *He stumbled backwards, bumping into Sebastian.*

Scoldrant: *It growled and faced the party, licking the blood off its claws.* "Graithh."

Holland: *He gasped in shock.* "Look at it!"

Blake: "It has the yellow eyes." *He sounded upset but showed no signs of sorrow.*

Sebastian: "How-? I couldn't detect it!"

Blake: (I couldn't sense it either-)

Sebastian: *He stepped back and pushed Holland forward, staring at the Scoldrant with frustration.* "Dang it."

Holland: *He looked behind him, noticing Sebastian's facial expression.* "I agree." *He mumbled in a deep voice, raising his arm.*

Blake: *He focused on Holland's hand.* (I know the feeling of those Astragons!-)

Holland: "I'll use a summon to-"

Sebastian: *He violently grabbed Holland's hand, forcefully lowering it to his side.* "You can't hurt our cousin!"

Blake: "Please. You think this mindless Scoldrant is our cousin-?"

Scoldrant: *It stood in a battle-ready pose and growled, staring off Blake, Holland and Sebastian.* "G-r-r-r."

Sebastian: *He looked at Blake with anger-filled sadness.* "We.. We can't."

Holland: "I don't like hurting Scoldrants either, but what are we meant to-?"

Blake: "Bitches, please-" *He strutted in front of Holland and Sebastian and opened his hand at the Scoldrant, closing his eyes.* (You're mine!)

Scoldrant: "Rawr-" *It became wary of Blake's arm, causing it to jump from side to side with cat-like agility.*

Sebastian: *He stared at the Scoldrant, gasping with widening eyes.* "Get out of the way!-"
Holland: *He gasped and stepped forward.* "Fireflies!-"

Scoldrant: *It pounced towards Blake with its claws pointing outwards.* "Graith!"

Blake: "Humph." *He opened his eyes as a tattoo-like marking drew itself on the Scoldrant's thigh.*

Scoldrant: "Graith-?" *It prematurely landed, sliding on all fours across the ground.*

Blake: *He watched the Scoldrant suddenly stop, causing dirt to flick on to his shoes.* "Now that's how ya get shit done around here."

Sebastian: *He observed the Scoldrant in confusion.* (Huh? She came to a complete halt?)

Holland: *He looked at the Scoldrant, observing the tattoo-like markings.* (I vaguely remember that on the Scoldrant we fought back in The Twilight Forest.)

Blake: "Good girl." *He cockily smirked, running his fingers through the Scoldrant's fur.*

Sebastian: *He closed his eyes and focused, causing a heartbeat-like glow to pulse around his feet.* (The Scoldrant's anger suddenly vanquished?!) "Astonishing."

Holland: "Nicely done."

Sebastian: *He opened his eyes and smirked, as if he knew how Blake stopped the Scoldrant.* "You've Soul Linked with it."

Blake: "Yeah."

Sebastian: "That's a very useful ability."

Blake: "Uhm, thanks." *He awkwardly accepted the compliment.*

Sebastian: "Thanks." *He brushed dirt off his bare feet and walked past Holland, making his way towards a clearing.*

Holland: *He stepped to the side and started to follow Sebastian, frowning with curiosity.* "Thanks for what?" *He held his shoulder in pain, staring at Sebastian's back.*

Sebastian: "Thanks for not hurting our cousin."

Blake: *He nodded his head in appreciation.* "It's OK, aye."

*The Scoldrant closely walked by Blake's side, occasionally making deep lion-like noises.*

Blake: (So we're heading to the Guelalia Cranners, aye..) "What about the poisonous gases?"

Sebastian: "As being a part of nature, we all should be fine."

Blake: "What's that supposedta mean?!"

Sebastian: "What it's supposed to mean? Exactly that!"

Blake: "I'm not sure if you got the, like, memo, hunni, but I'm not part of the tribe! I'm kinda going in blind, aye."

Holland: *He observed the clearing around him and slowed down, staring at a steep, curved-shaped hill in the distance.* (What a weird hill.)

*Sebastian and Blake stopped and turned around, facing Holland in confusion.*

Sebastian: *He looked over his shoulder, staring at what Holland was looking at.* "That-" *He glanced at Holland, pointing behind him to the hill.* "-Is Turnback Cave."

Holland: *He lowered his arms and observed the hill, pouting in thought.* (Turnback Cave.. Freya, you would've been so excited to explore this new cave with me...)

Blake: *He stared at Holland, as a cool gust of air gently brushed past him.* "I heard about some warriors getting sent on missions near The Turnback Cave, and never returning."

Holland: (I nearly forgot, this guy is a warrior.) *He cautiously glanced at Blake, watching his dark red hair flap to one side.*

Sebastian: *He glanced at the Scoldrant by Blake's side, triggering flashbacks of him settling it down.* "What are your names?"

Blake: "Huh?" *He hissed under his breath, looking at Sebastian as if he wasn't expecting that question.*

Sebastian: "I'm Sebastian."

Holland: "Holland." *He spoke in a deep voice, slightly smirking in a respectable manner.*

Blake: "Call me Blake, aye."

Sebastian: "Blake, Holland, good to meet you."

Blake: "Are we like besties now? Wat's with the sudden change of heart?"

Scoldrant: "Graith!" *It growled in a supportive manner.*

Blake: "Shh." *He hissed with a feminine giggle and rubbed his fingers through the Scoldrant's fur.*

Sebastian: "If we have to risk our lives together, I, at least, want to get along."

Holland: *He nodded his head with a smile, slowly walking towards Sebastian and Blake.* (I like this guy.)

Blake: "W-Watevs." *He rolled his eyes and folded his arms, looking away.*

Holland: "I just want to let you know, I've never been here before."

Sebastian: "Really? To Turnback Cave?"

Holland: "Yeah."

Blake: (That cripple chick knows her stuff, and she seems certain I'll be able to find the answer to my questions.) *He sighed, rolling his eyes again.* "Let's get this thingy then I can find where it is, then I'll be true to our kind."

Holland: "Huh?"
Sebastian: "What?"

Blake: "Nothing, jeez." *He looked at the Scoldrant, causing her to lower her back.* "I'll meet you at the entrance." *He hissed with emotion, jumping on the Scoldrant.*

Scoldrant: "Graithh." *She stood up and stepped to the side, prancing towards the entrance of Turnback Cave.*

Holland: *He watched Blake ride the Scoldrant towards the cave, glancing at Sebastian.* "Is there really a summon that can cure this disease?"

Sebastian: "To be honest, I'm not sure." *He continued to walk forward, looking at Holland.* "I hope so."

Holland: *He smiled and nodded his head.* "That's the spirit. If you have a positive attitude, you'll receive positive things, it's quite simple."

Sebastian: *He smirked with hidden doubt.* "You seem pretty cool."

Holland: "Ha ha, thanks I do try."

Sebastian: *He chuckled and slowly exhaled, growling with recollection.* "Actually, you seemed pretty sad when I glanced at you in the village."

Holland: "Yeah." *He smiled with sadness, looking down to his feet.* "I just miss her, that's all."

Sebastian: *He showed interest, staring at Holland with an empathy-filled face.* "Do you mind if I ask, how you two met?"

Holland: "The story dates back a long time ago, I was at Eon City-" *He looked at Sebastian noticing a curious smile on his face.* "You know where that is?"

Sebastian: "That's in the snowy region on the other continent?"

Holland: *He nodded his head, looking up in recollection.* "Yeah, well-"

----------

Keno: "We've talked a lot about your tribe's past..." *He looked down, staring at large tribal-like markings which glowed around him.* "But, what will happen in the future?"

Chief: "I envision a future where we can freely walk the land without being frowned upon."

Keno: "Oh?"

Chief: "Those strange and unwanted looks."

Keno: "I can kind of relate to how you feel, when Kosmo and I walked into villages-" *He licked his lips and coughed to stop his voice from croaking.* "The villagers would give Kosmo strange looks."

Chief: *He enthusiastically nodded his head.* "That's what I'm talking about."

Keno: "There was even a time where Kosmo was threatened out of a village."

Chief: "Even with you in presence?"

Keno: *He nodded his head, causing the chief to growl in disgust.* "I decided to leave and we took refuge in a nearby forest."

Chief: "If you were there, then why?"

Keno: "Because the villagers were attacked by a yellow-eyed Scoldrant the day before."

Chief: *He unintentionally snarled, causing his wolf-like teeth to show.* "That's exactly why we need-" *He paused in mid-sentence and frowned, causing his cat-like eyes to dilate.*

Keno: "Need to?"

Chief: "We need to find a cure to this disease!"

Keno: "I agree."

----------

Blake: *He looked up to the stars, rubbing his fingernails in thought.* (Every time I look up at night, it reminds me of you, babe.)

*Blake smirked and watched Holland and Sebastian walk into a clearing, causing him to pose in a carefree manner.*

Blake: "Wazzup?" *He leant against the sabre-toothed Scoldrant and waited with a sigh, watching Holland and Sebastian walk towards him.* "So, we're here."

Scoldrant: "Graithh." *She growled in agreement.*

Holland: *He walked up to Blake and stopped, focusing his attention to Sebastian.* "..."

Sebastian: "Yes we are." *He stopped next to Holland, glancing at the Scoldrant in a worried manner.* "But the Scoldrant needs to-"

Blake: "Yea I know." *He stepped forward and closed his eyes, causing the tribal-like marking to disintegrate off the Scoldrant's body.*

Scoldrant: *She shook her head in confusion as if she was just waking up.* "Grraiwth?"

Blake: "There."

Scoldrant: "Grai-?" *She glanced at the party and instinctively stepped back, suddenly sprinting away at blinding speeds into the distance.*

Holland: *He watched the Scoldrant run out of his sight, looking at Blake in confusion.* "It would've been smart to have the Scoldrant help us."

Blake: "You serious?" *He looked at Holland like he was an idiot.*

Holland: *He paused and thought to himself.* "Oh, the air."

Sebastian: *He looked to his side into the cave.* "Yes, the poisonous air would've harmed her."

Holland: "Her-?"

Blake: (Oh, the air.) *He thought in a dumb-like manner, rolling his eyes at Holland's slow response.* (Probs the only good thing about The Black Brigade is that none of 'em were stupid.)

Holland: "Like I said, I've never been here before." *He awkwardly chuckled.*

Blake: "Well?" *He turned around and peered inside the cave, causing the party to focus their attention to the cave's entrance.*

Holland: *He leant forward and squinted his eyes, scratching under his chin.* "It's a fork, what way to take?"

Sebastian: "I'll find out shortly." *He walked into the cave and gently felt along the wall.* "It's hard to figure out-" *He closed his eyes and started to concentrate.*

Blake: *He looked up and observed the cave.* (You wouldn't think that somefing apparently so important to them would be, like, in a plain boring cave like this.)

Holland: *He looked at his hand, mumbling in thought.* (I have no idea what to expect, this whole experience has been made up from on the spot decisions.)

Blake: *He tapped his foot with impatience and leant to one side, placing his hand on his waist.* "Hurry up?"

Holland: (Freya always hated when I did things on a whim.) *He smirked at himself.*

Sebastian: "Okay, we take a left and follow a single path until we hit a dead end."

Blake: "Dead end? That's stupid?" *He hissed.*

Sebastian: "No-" *He shook his head and opened his eyes.* "The path is for us, I can open the special path through the Guelalia Cranners."

Blake: "Wat's with the tone on us?"

Sebastian: "Well anyone can access Guelalia Cranners."

Holland: "..." *He quietly stood in the background, closely listening to the party.*

Blake: "Oh, I kinda get it." *He looked up in thought, staring at the cave's roof.*

Holland: (But I don't.) *He sighed to himself.*

Blake: *He focused his attention in front, looking into the pitch black cave.* "It's night, we can't see a thing!"

Holland: *He nodded his head in agreement, looking at Sebastian.* "How would people travel throughout the cave?"

Sebastian: "The cave usually lights up during the day and some parts of the cave have glowing moss." *He walked further into the cave, listening to his voice echo.*

Blake: *He watched Sebastian's image fade into the darkness.* "Wait, wut?"

Holland: "Dude, how can you see?" (Even with Freya's eyesight, it's still so dark in there.)

Sebastian: "I have natural Scoldrant eyes, I can see in the dark."

*The sounds of Sebastian's voice slowly changed pitch as he turned around, causing his eyes to light up light a wolf's.*

Blake: *He looked in the direction he saw Sebastian's eyes light up.* "You expect us to follow your voice or some crap-?"

Sebastian: "Yes! I'll lead the way."

Blake: *He crossed his arms, shaking his head.* "You've gotta be losing it if you think I'm following you in there."

Holland: *He watched Blake bicker to Sebastian's dark figure in the cave.* (I got it-)

Sebastian: "We have no time for this." *He turned around and his footsteps echoed away.*

Blake: "Too bad-" *He arrogantly shrugged his shoulders and closed his eyes, looking away.*

Holland: "Come to me." *He opened his hand, causing a light red pearl to materialise in his palm.*

Blake: *He noticed a light red-coloured glyph materialise and spiral in the air.* "Huh?"

Holland: "Fireflies!"

*A swarm of fireflies flew out of the rotating glyph and brightly lit up the area, causing Blake to smirk in amazement.*

Blake: (They're pretty.) *He reached out, watching a firefly fly onto his finger.*

Sebastian: "Guys?" *His voice echoed down the cave, catching the party's attention.*

Holland: "That's better." *He smirked at Blake and started to run into the cave, admiring the swarming bundles of light.*

Blake: "Don't run ahead of me!" *He swayed his arm and watched the firefly buzz around him, before running after Holland.*

----------

Keno: *He looked down, touching his chest.* (This entire ordeal with the pilgrimage... It makes me miss you even more, Kosmo...)

Chief: "Keno, we'll need to focus. If we're to follow their adventure, I'll need your help."

Keno: *He looked at the chief, nodding his head.* "Yes."

----------

Holland: *He kept a steady jogging pace, watching the fireflies light up the thin path ahead of him.* "Where-?" *He went around a slight, rocky bend and noticed Sebastian, staring at a dead end.* (Sebastian?)

Blake: *He smirked at the fireflies.* (This is an unexpected, yet super sexy summon to have. But they don't seem practical in a fight, tho.)

Sebastian: "You guys took forever." *He spoke with a growl, keeping a fixated stare on the wall.*

Blake: (Forever? Did he like sprint here?) *He hissed in thought while enthusiastically stamping down the path.*

Holland: "Sorry." *He came to a stop, taking a deep breath.*

Blake: *He slowed down and stood next to Holland, frowning in a bitchy-like manner.* (I was the first here, so why am I the last one to make it?) "So wat now?"

Sebastian: "What now?" *He placed his hands on the wall.*

Blake: "You tell us, hunni."
Holland: *He looked at Sebastian, raising an eyebrow in curiosity.* "What now? You're not sure?"

Sebastian: "..." *A tribal-like symbol appeared on the middle of the wall.*

Blake: *He focused his attention to the glyph.* "Do we gotta do anything? Like, so we're not standing here doing nothing, aye?"

Sebastian: "No-"

*The wall suddenly became transparent and glyphic-like symbols appeared in lines like sentences.*

Blake: *He discreetly smiled and leant to one side, pretending to look at his fingernails.* (This is sexy.. Actually, it feels familiar.)

Holland: (Daylight-?!)
Blake: *He squinted his eyes as bright light shined from behind the wall Sebastian revealed.* (It's so bright! Is that the magma?)

Holland: (Thanks-) *His thoughts and the light caused the fireflies to disintegrate into the air.*

Sebastian: (I'm excited-) *He unintentionally growled with growing anticipation.*

Blake: "The symbols, wat do they say?"

Holland: *He leant forward, inspecting the lines.* "I've seen those used in my village, but I can't understand it."

Blake: "It feels like I've seen 'em before, but... I don't recognise it either, hey."

Holland: *He looked at Blake in agreement.* "Yeah."

Sebastian: "It reads-"

Blake: "Aye? You can read it?!"

Holland: "Shh, let him read-"

Blake: "Shh? Bitch, please-"

Sebastian: *He touched the symbol, running his hand along it.* "Those who wield manifestation summons must confront and resolve unknown issues."

Blake: *He paused, slowly focusing his attention on Sebastian.* "And?"

Sebastian: "That's it." *He spoke as if he didn't know, lowering his arm.*

Holland: "Hmm?"
Blake: "So, unsexy-"

Holland: "Does that riddle mean anything to anyone?" *He shrugged his shoulders, shaking his head in confusion.*

Blake: "Nope."

Sebastian: "Maybe it doesn't apply to us?" *He thought with an idea, looking back to Holland and Blake.*

Blake: "So?" *He hissed, motioning his hand for Sebastian to enter the newly opened path.*

Sebastian: "Now our pilgrimage starts." *He stretched his arms and took a deep breath with anticipation, taking a step forward.*

Holland: *He watched Sebastian walk into the new area, glancing at Blake.* "Well-"

Blake: (Pfft-) "You can go first."

Holland: "Okay." *Blake's words caused him to take several steps towards the bright area ahead.*

Blake: *He noticed Holland stop, causing him to hiss in confusion.* "Why ya stopping?"

Holland: "Let's not keep him waiting." *He took a deep breath, stepping through the entrance.*

Blake: (Wat-evs.) *He rolled his eyes, shaking his head in a condescending manner.*

Holland: *He squinted his eyes and observed the rocky, desert-coloured area, watching spurts of fire flare out of the ground.* (Whoa, I didn't imagine this-)

*Rocks scraped under Holland's feet, causing Sebastian to become aware of his presence.*

Blake: *He took a deep breath, mentally readying himself.* (Why am I nervous? Cam, I wish you were, like, here to help me, hey.)

Sebastian: "It's exactly how I envisioned it. The red-rock terrain, the orange brightness, and-" *He listened to the sounds of popping magma in the background.* "The sounds-"

Blake: *He shook his hands and strutted into the area, looking to each side in disgust.* "Well, it's hot and stinky in here, aye."

Sebastian: "..." *He ignored Blake's complaints, continuing to observe the area around him.*

Blake: *He walked towards Sebastian and Holland, noticing the faint orange glow on their skin.* "..."

Holland: *He stopped next to Sebastian, observing the area with him.* "How long do you think this will take us?"

Sebastian: "The path itself isn't very long."

Blake: *He stood next to Holland and leant to one side, sighing to make his presence known.* "So-, karh-?" *He suddenly coughed, as smoke-like steam wafted past the party.*

Holland: *He coughed with a frown, waving his hand in front of his face.* "That must be the dangerous gases Keno was talking about."

Sebastian: "Yes." *He growled in agreement, watching the poisonous gas waft by.*

Blake: (Lucky we always have an Astragon coating. That's why captains are able to take killing hits without dying so quickly.)

Holland: "This entire area is like a rocky chamber-" *He looked around with heightened vision and noticed in the middle of the circular-like cave, was a pit of lava.* "It looks like we're in a volcano."

Blake: "Tssk." *He rolled his eyes, placing a hand on his waist.* "We are."

Holland: "First time being here-"

Blake: "Rite? Me, too. But I still at least know about this place, hey."

Sebastian: *He wiped a thin layer of sweat off his face and looked up, pointing towards another cave entrance.* "See up there?"

Holland: *He followed the circular path which ringed around the walls with his eyes, noticing another cave entrance.* "Yeah?"
Blake: "Wat's up there?"

Sebastian: "That's where we gotta go-" *He bent forward, growling in pain.*

Blake: "Aye?"
Holland: "Hey man, do you feel-?" *He stopped in mid-sentence and held his stomach, frowning in pain.*

Blake: *He looked at Holland and Sebastian in confusion.* "Stop being such girls and let's-" *He hissed with widening eyes, frozen with pain.*

Sebastian: *He growled and blinked, revealing his wolf-like eyes.* "Argh-"

*A wolf-human-like Scoldrant blasted out of Sebastian, catching his attention.*

Blake: "Wha!-"
Holland: "Argh-"

*Three Summonce Scarbras of yellow, light red and grey in colour materialised in front of Holland.*

Blake: (Wat are they?!) *He stared at the lights with widening eyes.* (This feeling! They're his Summonce-)

Holland: "H-Huh?" *A purple glyph shined and rotated in front of him, causing him to look down in shock.*

Blake: *A white, purple and blue Summonce Scarbra materialised in the air in front of him.* (These are mine?!) "No-"

Sebastian: *He looked in front, watching the wolf-human-like Scoldrant and the six Summonce Scarbras, disappear into the air.* (What's happening..?)

----------

*Destiny drank from a pond surrounded by a herd of Scoldrants, suddenly disintegrating into the air.*

--

*The fireflies buzzed deep in a cave and the cave suddenly dimmed, as they disintegrated into the air.*

--

*Twotters stood on the side of a cliff staring at the moon before suddenly disintegrating into the air.*

----------

Blake: *He reached out and paused, noticing nothing happened.* (Wat?! Skuxx?! Amanda?!)

Holland: "Phew." *He sighed in relief and stood up straight, glancing at Sebastian and Blake.* "What was all that about-?"

Blake: "I-I can't summon?!"

Holland: "What-?"

Blake: "My sexy Skuxx and Amanda?! I can't even summon that stupid girl!"

Holland: "Who's Skuxx-?"

Blake: "You fool." *He hissed at Holland as if he should've known better.*

Sebastian: *He awkwardly breathed and dropped to his knees, holding his throat in discomfort.* "C-Can't breathe." *He wheezed each word, catching Holland's attention.*

Holland: *He bent down, holding Sebastian up with his arm.* "What's wrong?"

Blake: "Umm, hello? Breathing-"

Sebastian: "The riddle-" *He coughed, frowning with realisation.* "The Scoldrants under our control have gone-" *He grunted in pain.*

Holland: "Why did this suddenly happen now?"

Blake: "It must be the pilgrimage thingy, aye."

Sebastian: "I understand-... Need my Scoldrant back."

Blake: (That thing that escaped him must be his inner Scoldrant? And he can't, like, breathe in this atmosphere without it.)

Holland: (Crud-)

Blake: "Oi-" *He clicked his fingers at Holland, catching his attention.* "Take Seb back to the path and I'll go find this Scoldrant."

Holland: *He nodded his head.* "Sounds good." *He adjusted his grip around Sebastian's arm, preparing to lift him up.*

Blake: *He stepped to the side, staring at Sebastian with full attention.* "What do I do?"

Sebastian: *He wheezed, looking up to Blake.* "The chief said he had to fight his inner demon.. Just f-fight it-" *He yelled in pain and collapsed out of Holland's grip.*

Holland: "We're trusting you." *He glanced at Blake and grabbed Sebastian under the arms, dragging him back towards the path they came from.*

Blake: *He looked at his hands, tightening his fists.* (I'm not sure if that Holland guy got any stronger, but I also excel in physical combat, even better than our last fight-)

*Blake closed his eyes and sighed, twiddling his fingers.*

Blake: (Despite the loss of those three, I still have all my other Summonce Scarbras?) *He opened his eyes, shrugging his shoulders in confusion.*

*A loud wolf-like roar echoed from above, catching Blake's attention.*

Blake: *He looked up with determination and started to run up the spiral, rocky path.* (Hope this bitch ain't tough.)

Holland: *He dragged Sebastian down the dark cave and rested him against the wall, sighing in a worried manner.* "You alright?"

Sebastian: *He started to breathe normally and leant up, becoming aware of his surroundings.* "Yeah, the air was intoxicating." *He coughed and rubbed his throat.*

Holland: "So, for people like me who don't get it, what happened?"

Sebastian: "It didn't make sense until after the fact. This is one of the pilgrimage's tests."

Holland: "So our summoning ability is gone?"

Sebastian: "No, you can still summon, it's actually the Scoldrants that were taken away."

Holland: *He paused in thought, attempting to understand what Sebastian said.* "I don't get it."

Sebastian: *He shook his head.* "It's not really important, I can sense all your summons gone."

Holland: "That's a little unfair don't you think?"

Sebastian: "What?"

Holland: "Well, I pictured all of your tribe members going into the trials and losing your Scoldrant powers, causing you to suffocate to the gases."

Sebastian: "Yes, that actually happened-" *He gasped and his eyes turned into a wolf's, as he unintentionally growled like an animal.*

Holland: *He leant back startled.* "Ah-?"

Blake: *He ran up to the entrance and leant forward, grinning at the party.* "Done! C'mon, bitches."

Sebastian: *He formed a fist and stood up, nodding his head in understanding.* "That was quick, how did you manage to defeat it so fast?"

Blake: *He shrugged his shoulders.* "Y'know, I dunno, aye." *He smirked and turned around, facing the path the party had to walk up.*

Holland: (That was quick.) "Ready then?"

Sebastian: "When you are."

Blake: "We're ready." *He hissed in an annoyed manner and started to walk away from the party.*

Sebastian: "Blake-" *He jumped forward and jogged back into the magma lit area, walking behind Blake.*

Blake: "Wat?"

Sebastian: "Thank you."

Blake: *His eyes widened.* "... OK."

Sebastian: (Okay? What kind of acceptance is that?)

Blake: (I'm still getting used to this type of recognition-) "When I pursued Sebastian's Scoldrant thingy, I nearly fell off this path several times-" *He glanced at the rocky ledges, focusing his attention back in front.* "So be careful, aye."

Sebastian: "Alright, will try."
Holland: *He stepped closer to the wall, glancing at the ledge.* "Yeah, thanks."

Blake: *He discreetly smirked in confusion.* (These men are complimenting me?)

Holland: *He started to walk up the path with Sebastian and Blake, looking down to his feet.* (My feet are hot.. Why do these trials always consist of rocky paths along the wall?)

Blake: (The path is really thin here-) *He looked down, watching bright yellow magma slowly swirl in a pool.* (I can feel a current of hot air-)

Sebastian: *He noticed Blake leaning further and further down the path, watching him fall forward.* "Blake!-" *He quickly grabbed Blake's shoulder and pushed him back onto the wall.*

Blake: "Ah-" *He momentarily froze with fear and shock.* (I wasn't expecting-)

Sebastian: "Try not to look down."

Blake: "Y-Yea." *He shook his head, slapping himself across the face in frustration.* (I'm such a dirty lamp.. Even after warning them about the ledges, I-)

*A horse's sneeze echoed further up the path, catching Holland's attention.*

Holland: *He looked up and stared at the bottom of the next path, which ringed a level above him.* "Did anyone else hear that?"

Blake: *He regained his posture and leant off the wall, continuing to walk along the path.* "Nope."

Holland: "Sebastian?"

Sebastian: "No I didn't."

Holland: "Oh, okay then." *He scratched his head in confusion.*

Blake: "Thanks, aye."

Sebastian: *He smirked at Blake, showing his canine-like teeth.* "You're right."

Blake: "Faster we do this, the faster I can get back to the stupid guild." *He took several quick steps and moved in a jog-like motion as if he wanted the party to run with him.*

Holland: "I can't disagree." *He smirked and started to run with Blake.*

Sebastian: *He awkwardly started to run after Blake, trying to suppress his growing nervousness.* (Everything will be fine until we confront the phoenix.) *His hair bobbed up and down, as he ran with a slight spring to his feet.*

----------

Keno: "What's that I'm feeling?"

Chief: "They're about to face their first inner confrontations."

Keno: "..." *He looked back down to the green, glowing glyphs, licking his lips in suspense.*

----------

*The party steadily ran up the spiral path, listening to the different tones of their heavy breathing.*

Blake: *He ran onto a platform, noticing the path widen.* "The path gets bigger, so you bitches don't need to worry-" *He paused in mid-sentence and cautiously stopped, causing Holland and Sebastian to awkwardly stop next to him.* (A Scoldrant? I can feel it somewhere-)

Holland: "What is it?" *He looked at Blake puzzled.*

Sebastian: *He sniffed and instinctively growled, looking to each side in an aggressive manner.* "I sense something-"

*A horse suddenly dived past the party from behind and glided in front, landing on the path.*

Holland: *He smiled, stepping forward in excitement.* "Destiny!"

Destiny: *She intensely stared at the party and sneezed, stamping on the path in front of her.* (Turn back.)

Holland: "Why?"

Sebastian: *He looked at Holland puzzled.* "Who are you talking to?"

Blake: "He's talking to the Scoldrant." *He spoke as if he understood what Holland was experiencing.*

Sebastian: "Oh, this must be his battle-" *He looked in front of the path and failed to see anything.* "We have to sit this battle out."

Blake: "Why?" *He hissed in disagreement.*

Sebastian: (From what the chief told me, we'd be unable to help fight it regardless.) "If he's mastered the Soul Link between this summon, then it would've already sided with us."

Blake: "But I defeated your Scoldrant for you?"

Sebastian: "Well-"

*Destiny and Holland slowly faded away, causing Blake to hiss in shock.*

Blake: "Ah?! Where'd they go!?" *He spun around in confusion.*

Sebastian: (Good luck.) *He growled in thought, looking in the area where Holland had stood.*

Blake: *He faced Sebastian full of confusion.* (He's standing on the spot without a sign of surprise on his face, it's as if he knew this was gonna happen.) "Why..?"

Holland: *Everything around him was pitch black.* "This looks like an Ougi or Grand Rostical." *He mumbled to himself, looking around puzzled.*

Destiny: (Although I came to you, you never progressed our power.)

Holland: "Wha-? What are you talking about?" *He stared at Destiny who stood out due to the darkened background and her vibrant colour.*

Destiny: (We never trained, you never used my potential!) *She stamped her hooves into the ground, startling Holland.*

Holland: "Well.." *He unintentionally pulled an unusual facial expression, as if he didn't know what to say.* "I-..?"

Destiny: (I will show you what I'm compatible of!) *She sneezed and stood in a battle-ready pose, spreading her wings.*

Holland: "H-Huh? You want to fight-?"

Destiny: *She flapped her wings once, causing a wave of dirt to swirl away.* "Meeheehee." *She leant forward, gliding towards Holland at a fast speed.*

Holland: "Grr-" *He rolled to the side, closely avoiding her wing attack.*

Destiny: *She swooped in a circular motion and turned around, facing Holland.* (Not bad, but you never used my Azure Burst! Not even once! Screaming Gale.)

Holland: "Screaming what-?"

Destiny: *She flapped her wings in mid-air and tilted at an angle, revealing her stomach.* "Meehehe."

Holland: *He raised his arms in a defensive manner.* (I have no idea what she plans to do-)

Destiny: *Silver wind swirled from her wings and blasted towards Holland.* (My power, you have completely underestimated it!)

Holland: *He watched the wind blow past him, slicing sand and rock past him.* (Dang it!)

Destiny: *She slowly descended, landing on the ground.* "Meeheehee."

*The wind died down, causing Holland to lean forward in confusion.*

Holland: "Why are you attacking me-?" *He deeply inhaled, before coughing out dirt.*

Destiny: "..." *She sneezed and galloped towards Holland.* (I respect those who use my power to the fullest!) *She jumped and glided into striking distance.*

Holland: *He swirled his body and leant to one side, avoiding Destiny's wing attack.* "Wha-" *He watched Destiny land on the ground next to him, sliding back.*

Destiny: *She placed weight on her front hooves and quickly kicked Holland in the chest, knocking him off his feet.* "Meeheehe."

Holland: "Kah-"

Destiny: (Screaming Gale!) *She spun around and faced Holland, flapping her wings.*

Holland: *He gritted his teeth in pain, listening to swirling wind howl around him.* (Hard to breathe-)

Destiny: "Meehehe!" *She flapped harder, watching the silver wind blast chunks of rock off the ground.*

Holland: *He shouted, as the rocks plummeted past his face.* "Gah!-"

Destiny: *She stood on all fours and scraped her hooves on the ground, preparing to charge.* (Why should someone as weak as you wield my power?!)

Holland: *He fell and hit the ground, sliding back in disorientation.* "Oof-"

Destiny: (Why?!) *She shouted in thought and flapped once, blasting herself into the air.*

Holland: *He came to a stop and quickly looked up, staring at Destiny in an urgent manner.* (What can I do without any powers-?!)

Destiny: *She flew directly above Holland and leant down, diving towards the ground at incredible speeds.* "Meehehehe."

Holland: *He stared at Destiny with widening eyes and quickly rolled on his side, avoiding her devastating attack.* "Grr-"

Destiny: *She felt the ground rumble, as the rocky ground cracked under her hooves.* (You have nothing to strike me back with?) *She looked to her side at Holland, watching him stand up with a worried expression.*

Holland: (I don't know what to do.) *He stepped back and his foot slid on a loose rock, causing him to glance down.* (The rock slid under my foot, I almost-)

Destiny: (Well?!)

Holland: *He mumbled in thought.* (The rocks... Maybe if I-)

Destiny: (Don't answer me then!) *She prepared to attack and flapped once, causing her to glide across the ground towards Holland.* (Screaming Gales.)

Holland: "Now!" *He grunted at himself and ran forward, sprinting towards Destiny for a collision.*

Destiny: (Huh?) *She sneezed in shock and proceeded to flap her wings, causing silver wind to swirl out.*

Holland: "Here-" *He shouted with anticipation and jumped up, landing on top of Destiny's neck.*

Destiny: (Get off!-)

Holland: "How about this for brains?" *He applied all his body weight on Destiny's head, causing her nose to touch the ground.*

Destiny: (You!-) *She enthusiastically flapped her wings and blasts of silver wind exploded the ground around her head.* (Argh!-)

Holland: "It worked!" *He coughed as a dirt cloud formed up around them.*

Destiny: *She squinted her eyes, as rocks violently swirled around her face.* "Meeeheeehee!"

Holland: "Whoa-" *A blast of wind knocked him off Destiny, tumbling him out of the dirt cloud.*

Destiny: *She flapped one wing to blow away the dirt.* "Br-r-r-r."

Holland: *He spread his legs and sat in a casual manner, patting dirt off one side of his arm.* "..."

Destiny: *She stood up and trotted to the side, facing Holland.* "..."

Holland: "What happens now?" *He mumbled with uncertainty and looked at Destiny who silently stared at him.*

Destiny: (Using your head.. I like, and respect that.) *She turned around and started to trot away, causing Holland to step forward in confusion.*

Holland: "Where-?"

Destiny: (If you don't use me to your fullest, expect another round.)

Holland: "What-?" *A yellow pearl materialised in his hand and the area reverted back to normal.*

Blake: *He leant to one side and rolled his eyes, hissing in an annoyed manner.* "There you are."

Sebastian: (Blake seems to alter how he acts towards us?) *He discreetly sighed in relief, smirking at Holland.* (He made it.)

Holland: (Destiny's gone?) *He lifted himself up and looked around puzzled.* (That was... Different-)

Blake: "Oi, you were gone for a fair bit, c'mon." *He impatiently hissed, wiping sweat off his forehead.*

Sebastian: "It wasn't that long-"

Blake: "Bitch, lemme over exaggerate."

Holland: *He looked around in a slight daze, nodding his head in understanding.* "Yeah, go on."

Blake: "Hmph." *He looked at Sebastian and started to run up the path.*

Sebastian: *He ran after Blake and focused his attention ahead, panting in an animal-like manner.* "He's probably just confused by the confrontation with one of his summons."

Blake: (He's confused?) *He hopped over a loose rock and looked to his side, glancing at Sebastian.* "How could ya possibly know that?"

Sebastian: "I took as much knowledge from the chief as I could."

Blake: "Wha-?" *He unintentionally snarled, glaring at Sebastian in complete confusion.*

Sebastian: "He had experience doing this pilgrimage, only a fool wouldn't listen to someone with experience."

Blake: "Ah, watevs."

Sebastian: *He looked over his shoulder, awkwardly breathing through his mouth.* "Holland!"

Holland: *He snapped out of his daze and started to jog along the path, looking up.* (They're already a level above me-) "Wait for me!"

Blake: "Huh?" *He gasped and slowed down, spinning around in fright.*

Sebastian: *He slowed down, looking curious at Blake.* "Something wrong?"

Blake: "I heard something, aye."

Sebastian: (His summon?) *He watched Blake suddenly disappear, causing him to stagger back in a patient-like manner.*

Holland: *He looked at his hand and formed a fist, smirking in thought.* (It's good to have you back, Destiny.)

*Buzzing sounds echoed in the distance, causing Holland to stop.*

Holland: *He looked around, as he tried to pinpoint where the noise came from.* (I'm not going crazy, I thought I-) *He cautiously stepped to the ledge and peered down to the lava.* (-From here?)

*A swarm of fireflies shot up from the lava and startled Holland, knocking him on to his bottom.*

Holland: (They were camouflaged with the brightness of the lava!-)

Fryfry: (Why.. Why was someone like you given our power?) *The swarm swirled in a cluster above Holland, as the area turned into darkness.*

Holland: (Not again-) "What are you talking about? Season gave me the-"

Fryfry: (Then answer this, what is our name?)

Holland: *He reached behind his back and a yellow pearl materialised in his palm.* (This time I'm not alone-)

Fryfry: (As we thought!)

Holland: *He jumped back on to his feet and ran forward, charging towards Fryfry.* "How am I meant to remember your name if I was never told it!"

Fryfry: "Zzzzzzzzbzzz." (Such an insult.)

Holland: *He gritted his teeth and formed a fist around the pearl effectively hiding it.* "Harh-" *He ran into striking distance and raised his arm, punching towards the clustered swarm.*

Fryfry: (Myrror Shield.)

Holland: (Another move I've never heard of?!) *He mumbled, as the outer fireflies crossed paths, forming a glass-like reflective shield.*

Fryfry: "Bzzzst." *They buzzed in a formulated-like manner, watching Holland punch the shield.*

Holland: "Karh-" *He gritted his teeth and the shield shined, pushing him back into the air.*

Fryfry: (We don't want you as our master.) *They watched Holland scrape along the ground.*

Holland: (You wanted me to use you at your fullest? Well, I'll definitely satisfy your needs!) "Go!" *He threw the Summonce Scarbra into the air, watching a yellow glyph shine above him.*

Fryfry: (What is this?) *They buzzed from side to side, as if they were looking up.*

Holland: "Help me!"

Destiny: *She flapped out of the glyph and dived down, landing next to Holland.* (You've released me already?) *Her voice sounded surprised.*

Holland: (I'll need all the help you can give me.)

Destiny: "Meeeheeehee." *She sneezed in acceptance and stamped her hooves on the ground, staring at the swarm of fireflies.*

Fryfry: (What are you waiting for? The master who doesn't even know our name!)

Holland: "Let's go." *He mumbled to Destiny and leant forward, charging towards Fryfry.*

Destiny: *She flapped high into the air, causing a pulse of dirt to swirl away.* "Meehehe."

Holland: *He smirked and formed a fist, preparing to punch Fryfry.* (Let's do this, Destiny!)

Destiny: (Screaming Gale.) *She flapped downwards, blasting silver wind on top of Fryfry and Holland.*

Holland: "W-What?" *He looked down in shock, noticing his feet slide across the ground.* (The wind is pushing me-) "No, Destiny-"

Destiny: (Do you want me to hold back?) *She stopped flapping her wings, causing the wind to die down.*

Holland: "No!" *He yelled at Destiny, as if he knew his answer could lose her respect.*

Fryfry: (Myrror Shield.)

Holland: *He noticed fireflies buzz around his head, staring at their lights with widening eyes.* "Crud-"

Fryfry: "Bzzst." *They watched a mirror-like shield blast Holland back, knocking him across the ground.*

Holland: "Oof-" *He tumbled across the ground, tightening his arms.*

Fryfry: *They watched Holland slowly come to a stop, noticing small streams of dirt puff around him.* "Bzzz bzzz zz bzz."

Destiny: *She swooped down and landed, standing next to Holland.* (What's the next move?)

Holland: *He grunted and stood back up, ignoring the grazes on his elbows and knees.* (Who would of thought a shield could be so effective.)

Destiny: (A shield is pointless if there's nothing for it to block against.)

Holland: *Destiny's thoughts triggered an idea, causing him to smirk.* "You're right."

Destiny: *She sneezed and glanced at Holland, before focusing her attention back to Fryfry.* (What's the plan?)

Holland: *He closed his eyes and focused.* "I don't see why I couldn't do this before-"

Destiny: (Holl-) *A blue string spiralled out of Holland and connected into her.*

Holland: *He started to frown, causing more blue strings to spiral out, connecting him with Destiny.* (You understand right?) *He opened his eyes and formed fists, standing in a proud manner.*

Destiny: (Our Soul Link!.. Yes, I know what your intentions are.) *She flapped her wings and flew straight up into the air.*

Holland: (What can it shield if I have no intentions of attacking it? Unlike Destiny, I have to change the way I fight if I want to win this battle.) *He started to run towards the swarm.*

Fryfry: *They noticed Holland charging towards them.* (You can't break our shield without being knocked off your feet-)

Destiny: (Screaming Gale.)

*Silver wind howled downwards towards Holland and Fryfry.*

Holland: *He formed a fist and raised it into the air, as if he was going to punch Fryfry.* "Take this."

Fryfry: (Myrror Shield-) *The wind hit Holland's back, causing his speed to dramatically increase.*

Holland: *He skidded across the ground and past the mirror-like shield which shined past him.* (Wow, one of my ideas worked.) *He watched the swarm of fireflies buzz around him.*

*The silver wind reflected off the shield and blasted away from Fryfry.*

Fryfry: (We know another move-)

Holland: *He closed his eyes and concentrated.* (Focus, just gotta focus.)

Fryfry: *The swarm suddenly started to buzz in a violent-like manner, causing their individual lights to brighten.* (Notorious-)

Holland: (Holland, you can do this!) *Blue strings connected from the fireflies and into Holland, causing the swarm to suddenly stop buzzing.*

Destiny: (I see.) *She flapped from a bird's eye view, hovering in mid-air.* (He is finally being smart and understanding his summons.)

Holland: "Well, Fryfry, I had no idea you could use a shield too." *His words caused the shield to vanish and the swarm to separate around him.*

Fryfry: (What? What did you just say?) *The swarm became more relaxed, as they flew in a slow, calm manner around Holland.*

Holland: "Fryfry, it's a pleasure to know your name."

Fryfry: *The swarm swirled in lines away from Holland and disintegrated into nothing, as a light red pearl materialised in the air.* (Don't forget it.)

Holland: *He looked back up and noticed Destiny disintegrate into nothing, watching the area revert back to normal.* (Dude, a shield!)

*Holland grabbed the Summonce Scarbra and inspected it, smiling in a goofy, masculine manner.*

-

Sebastian: *He followed Blake and ran with a slight leap, allowing him to catch up.* "You're stronger now."

Blake: "Ya reckon?" *He sighed and wiped sweat off his forehead again.* (I didn't do much fighting or take any damage, but I'm a little puffed out.)

Sebastian: "Also-" *He continued to jog up the path with Blake, awkwardly glancing behind him.* "Do you think we should wait for Holland?"

Blake: *He panted in exhaustion, shaking his head with uncertainty.* "I do and don't."

Sebastian: (Blake's a little tired from confronting both his summons in a row.)

Blake: "If he's too busy fighting his summons, then I'll need your help." *He sounded worried, triggering a flashback of the white Summonce Scarbra disappearing in the air.*

Sebastian: "You look pretty concerned? What kind of summon is it?"

Blake: "It's not a summon, but a Summonce Scarbra of someone I know."

Sebastian: "I don't understand."

Blake: "I don' know if I'll be able to defeat her even with all my summons-"

Sebastian: "And me."

Blake: "Aye?"

Sebastian: "You helped me, I'll help you. That's all there is to it." *He blinked and revealed his wolf-like eyes.*

Blake: "Yea, sure." *He half smirked, looking ahead with a lack of enthusiasm.*

-

Holland: *He tilted his head upwards, listening to Blake and Sebastian's conversation.* (Man, sounds like they're nearly at the top already.)

*Holland kicked his heel and started to jog up, feeling the numerous cuts on his arm.*

Holland: (I personally didn't realise how strong those two-)

*A sonic shockwave exploded the path in front of Holland, causing rocks to crumble.*

Holland: "What?!"

*Blake and Sebastian nearly lost their balance, as the path rumbled under their feet.*

Sebastian: *He looked down the path in shock, frowning with contemplation.* "Should we?"

Blake: "Tssk! I suppose we should help him-"

*A bird-like screech echoed at the end of the path, drawing Sebastian and Blake's attention towards the cave-like entrance.*

Holland: *A dirt cloud masked the damage the shockwave caused.* "What is it now?" *He mumbled with impatience, looking around in a cautious manner.*

Twotters: *She gracefully leapt from the dirt cloud and faced Holland, licking her paw in a casual manner.* "Meow."

Holland: *He stared at Twotters, listening to her purr in confusion.* "..."

Twotters: "..."

Holland: "..."

Twotters: (So, you-) *She calmly continued to stare at Holland, swaying her tail from side to side.*

Holland: "Yeah..?"

Twotters: (-How many times have you released me?)

Holland: "Ahh.." *He paused and looked at his hand, counting his fingers in thought.*

Twotters: (Once, not that it matters. You just need to keep me interested in being your aid.)

Holland: "Your attitude is different from the others."

Twotters: *She slowly stepped closer to Holland, causing her whiskers to extend.* (No, just more reserved I suppose.)

Holland: "Umm, okay then-"

Twotters: (Harmonic Pulsar.) *Her whiskers bent forward and touched, causing a visible swirl of sound which echoed like violins to form into a ball.*

Holland: *He frowned and stepped back, standing in a battle-ready pose.* (I have to fight even Twotters-?)

Twotters: "Meow-" *She jumped forward and a blast of sound exploded around Holland.*

Holland: "Crud-" *He instinctively covered the sides of his face, as violin-sounding winds blasted around him.* (Her sound alone hurts!-)

*Holland stood on the spot motionless, watching the area around him turn to darkness.*

Holland: (Why am I just standing in one spot like a fool?!)

Twotters: (Soft Acoustics.) *A professional-sounding violin materialised as grey ribbons in the air.*

Holland: (The sounds manifested as these things?) *He watched the grey ribbons swirl around him, effectively dulling his battle attributes.*

Twotters: "Purr.."

Holland: *He lowered his arms and his eyes twitched, watching the ribbons fall to the ground.* (Those ribbons made noises like that musical instrument Twortz used-)

Twotters: (I was watching your previous fights. Release them.)

Holland: *He gritted his teeth and looked annoyed, forming fists.* (She knows about Destiny and Fryfry!-)

Twotters: (I will make him release them. Sorrow Chorus.) *She opened her jaw and the sounds of slow, low-toned violins echoed, causing Holland's vision to blur.*

Holland: (My eyes?!)

Twotters: (These status attacks can be quite deadly if stacked upon each other.)

Holland: "Dang it!-" *He threw a yellow and a light red pearl into the air, causing two glyphs to spiral above him.*

*Destiny and Fryfry flew out of their respective coloured glyphs.*

Twotters: *She purred, watching the party line up in front of her.* (I don't recall you sending out multiple summons before.)

Holland: (Neither did I, but-) *He looked fatigued, glancing at Fryfry and Destiny.* (She's right.) *He breathed heavily, gently touching his throat.* (That pressure feeling I get when I release a summon has already doubled-)

Twotters: *She watched Holland mumble in deep thought, frizzing her fur in response.* (I won't give him time to think.)

Destiny: *She listened to the sounds of an echoing violin, drawing her attention to Twotters.* (Holland?)

Twotters: *She watched a swirl of visible sound form into a ball in front of her.* (Harmonic Pulsar.)

Holland: *He stared at Twotters, helplessly shaking his head.* (I don't know what to do.)

Fryfry: (Holland?)

Holland: "Umm-"

Twotters: "Meow." *She jumped forward, blasting the ball of sound towards him.*

Holland: "No-" *He raised his arms in a defensive manner, causing Fryfry to swarm in front.*

Fryfry: (Myrror Shield.)

*The ball of sound hit the shield and bounced back, exploding into different sounds of violin several feet away.*

Holland: *He watched the dirt swirl around the area the ball exploded.* (Awesome-)

Twotters: "Reowyl!" *She frizzed her fur, hissing with annoyance.*

Holland: (Okay, think about Twotters' moves.. I can deflect it with Fryfry's shield-)

Fryfry: "Bzzst." *They buzzed behind Holland, as if they was waiting for Twotters' next move.*

Holland: (Also, sounds can be nullified by other sounds and can be manipulated by wind.) *He hit himself on the head, trying to hasten his thoughts.* "Okay, I got it!"

Twotters: (Already?) *She thought to herself and bent her whiskers, touching them together.* (Harmonic Pulsar.)

Holland: (Well, my other two plans didn't fail, why not try this too?) *He thought to himself, causing Fryfry to swarm near Twotters.*

Twotters: (I neither respect or disrespect Holland.. But, I need him to be aware I'm not just a gift to be given out!)

Destiny: (She's continuing to gather Neurons into her Harmonic Pulsar.) *She thought with a sneeze, alerting Holland of the threat in front of them.*

Twotters: (I'll charge enough power into this Azure Burst, it'll cause my foes to become deaf!) *She jumped forward, blasting the ball of sound towards Holland.*

Holland: *He nervously gulped, stepping back in a worried manner.* "Quickly!"

Destiny: *She gathered her attention to the ball of sound and flapped downwards, blasting silver wind towards it.* (Screaming Gale.)

Holland: *He watched the silver wind push the ball of sound back, bracing himself incase his plan didn't work.* "Good! Destiny, now!-"

Destiny: "Meeheehee." *She slightly tilted angle, changing the direction of the silver wind.*

Holland: *He watched the wind push the ball of sound towards Fryfry, causing him to nod his head in concentration.* (Good-)

Fryfry: (Myrror Shield.) *The fireflies moved from side to side and a reflective-like shield shined around them.*

Destiny: *She continued to flap her wings, observing the battle scene.* (A combination of our attacks.)

Fryfry: *The shield reflected the ball of sound and silver wind, bouncing it towards Twotters.* "Bzzzst." *The swarm swirled backwards, as the shield prematurely disintegrated.*

Twotters: "Grayroewl!"

Holland: *He discreetly smirked with shock, amazement and anticipation, watching the ball of sound enveloped with silver wind blast in front of Twotters.* "I'm feeling like Lance and I'm gonna say-"

*The area around Twotters violently exploded with ear piercing sounds.*

Twotters: "Gwraylle!" *Her screech echoed with a chord of violin, as she disintegrated into the air.*

Holland: "-I'm awesome-" *He watched a pulse of dirt blast around where Twotters stood, revealing nothing but deep cracks in the ground.*

Fryfry: (It worked!)
Destiny: (Great work, Holland!)

Holland: "Thanks." *He mumbled with appreciation and stared at the ground, smirking to himself in thought.* (I wasn't sure it would've worked.)

Twotters: (You show understanding that you can wield my power, use it wisely.) *Her voice echoed, causing Holland to look up.*

Holland: "Yeah!" *A grey pearl materialised in his hand, as the area reverted back to normal.*

Destiny: "Meeheehee." *She sneezed in a proud manner, disintegrating with Fryfry into the air.*

Holland: "Alright, got them all." *He panted with a triumphant-like smirk and took a moment to rest, noticing a gap in the path.* "Twotters' shockwave broke the path-"

*Blake and Sebastian yelled in pain, instantly catching Holland's attention.*

Holland: *He gasped and looked up, noticing orbs of Neurons float in the air.* (What's going on up there?!) *He shouted in thought and prepared to run, quickly glancing at the path.* (Crud, I can't jump over that..)

*Holland frowned in thought and looked back up, staring at the orbs of light.*

Holland: "I got it-" *He stepped to the side and suddenly ran off the path, jumping down towards the magma.* "Let's go!-"

Destiny: *She flew out of a spiralling glyph and dived under Holland, catching him on her back.* (What is that Neuron signature?) *She flapped her wings and glided, waiting for Holland to adjust himself.*

Holland: (Don't know, but we'll find out.) *He looked up with determination, cueing Destiny to fly up towards the roof.*

*An eruption of rocks and boulders exploded from the highest path, instantly alerting the party.*

Holland: *His hair flapped around his ears, as he stared at the falling boulders with widening eyes.* (What's happening up there-?!)

Destiny: (I won't be able to avoid all the rocks in this limited amount of space.) *She sneezed and skilfully tilted angle, avoiding several boulders.*

Holland: *He looked up and noticed a boulder plummeting towards his head, causing him to gasp.* "Ah-?!" *He braced himself, watching a reflective-like shield suddenly bounce the boulder to the side.* "Whoa-"

Destiny: (Thank you!) *She continued to fly up, watching the swarm buzz around her.*

Fryfry: (We can freely use ourselves if you're in danger.) *Their words caused Holland to smile.*

Destiny: (We're almost there-) *She flew to the top of the path and landed, instantly noticing the cave entrance sealed by boulders.*

Holland: "No-" *He grunted in failure, staring at the sealed entrance with lowering morale.*

Twotters: *She casually pounced off the roof and spiralled in the air, landing on Holland's shoulder.* "Meow."

Holland: "Twotters? Where did you come from?" *He mumbled under his breath, looking up to the roof in confusion.*

Twotters: *She moved her whiskers, causing violin strings to echo.* "Meow-"

Holland: *He focused his attention to Fryfry and Destiny.* "What are we going to do-?"

Twotters: "Reow!" *She flicked her whiskers in an aggressive manner, causing the sounds to blast the boulders away, revealing the entrance.*

Holland: *He smirked, staring at the entrance in a victorious manner.* "I'm not alone-"

*Holland gasped and instinctively closed his eyes, watching an eye with a purple ring around its iris slowly open in a dark room.*

Holland: (What? Something flashed in my head-?) *He mumbled in thought and opened his eyes, shaking his head.* (A vision-?)

Twotters: "Meow!" (Let's check out what happened.)

Holland: "Ah-?"

Destiny: "Meehehe." *She sneezed and galloped forward, diving into the cave-like entrance at a fast speed.*

Holland: (A tunnel-?)

*Fryfry swarmed in front of the party and lit the cave up, allowing Destiny to keep her fast speed.*

Destiny: *She tilted angle, flying in a skilful and confident manner.* (It's not long.)

Fryfry: *Several fireflies strayed behind, buzzing around Holland.* (We feel a powerful summon up ahead.)

Holland: *Another image of the eye flashed in his mind, causing him to place a hand on his head in disorientation.* "Argh-"

Twotters: *She started to slant to one side, causing her to dig her nails into Holland.* (Hold on, or you'll fall-)

Holland: "Y-Yeah-?" *He moaned and frowned with concentration, focusing on his surroundings.*

Destiny: *She flew out of the tunnel, gliding into a large, naturally blue-lit area.* (What is this place?) *She slowly flapped her wings and bent her legs, landing on the dark-coloured rock.*

Twotters: (This area is all cool in colour, completely different from the path before.) *She purred in thought, causing Holland to nod his head in agreement.*

Holland: (It's lit by blue magma?)

Fryfry: *They noticed yellowy-white orbs float near the walls, causing their individual brightness to fade.* (Our senses, this area is affecting it.)

Holland: *He hopped off Destiny and placed his hand on her body, looking up in a curious manner.* "This whole area looks like it was made by a volcano?"

Destiny: (I wouldn't know-) *She sneezed, withdrawing her wings.*

Twotters: "Meow-" (Where are we?)

Holland: "I've never been here before, so I don't know where-"

*Moans caught Holland's attention, causing him to step forward in a cautious manner.*

Holland: "Huh-?" *He noticed Blake and Sebastian on the ground, causing the fireflies to provide him with light.* (There they are!)

Blake: *He lay on his back and coughed, smirking at the ceiling in thought.* (Arcadia.. I don't like these stupid tests, but I feel pretty good when I pass 'em.. Sounds stupid-)

Sebastian: "I can't believe you have a summon that strong." *He lay on his stomach and laughed with a slight growl, blowing dirt away from his mouth.*

Blake: "She's not really a summon I've used before, hey."

Sebastian: "Either way, we completed it."

Blake: *He nodded his head and looked to the side, smiling at Sebastian.* "We did it, bestie."

Sebastian: "Yeah." *He growled in an animal-like manner, smiling in relief.*

Holland: "Blake-" *He stepped forward and his eyes rolled back, causing his legs to buckle.* "Seb-"

Blake: *He watched Twotters, Fryfry and Destiny disintegrate all at once, drawing his attention to Holland.* "Aye-?"

Holland: "T-Tired.." *He spoke under his breath and fell face-first onto the ground, causing Sebastian to become alert.*

Sebastian: "Holland?" *His voice echoed.*

*The area became black and an image of the eye flashed in Holland's mind, causing him to wake up.*

Holland: "Huh?" *He scratched behind his head, looking to each side with squinted eyes.* "Where am I now?"

*Holland mumbled in a deep voice and slowly stood up, staring at the darkness.*

Holland: (Pitch black-?)

?????: (You! Why are you wasting your life?!)

Holland: (That voice?!) *He enthusiastically spun around, gasping with hope.*

?????: (You were given a second chance and you throw it away?)

Holland: "Freya! Where are you?!" *He shouted with emotion, intensely staring at the darkness around him.*

?????: (Look at you-)

Holland: (I can't believe it!-) "Where are you?!"

?????: (Why throw your second chance away?!)

Holland: "Without you, a second chance is meaningless!" *He swayed his arms, portraying his emotion.*

?????: (Do you know what an insult it is, seeing you mope around after giving you my everything!)

Holland: "Knowing you died-"

?????: (Our Soul Link is unbreakable! If you're alive, then I'm alive! How can you be so foolish to not understand the basics!)

Holland: *He gasped, as Freya's words triggered several flashbacks of Keno talking.* (He knew.. The whole time, but then again, how could I forget?)

Freya: *She opened her eyes and the markings over her body glowed, revealing her position.* (In order to break the seal, you need to show me if you're worthy of harnessing my power.)

Holland: "Freya, I could never hurt you-"

Freya: "Grr-"

Holland: "Freya, please-"

Freya: *She gargled water and opened her jaw, preparing to attack.* (Gargling Whirlpool.) *She jumped forward, barking out a vortex of water towards Holland.*

Holland: *He gritted his teeth and looked away, as if he knew he had to fight.* (Damn it.)

*Three glyphs rotated in front of Holland, catching Freya's attention.*

Fryfry: *They quickly swarmed in front of Holland and raised a reflective-like shield, bouncing the attack back.* (Myrror Shield.)

Freya: "Rawr?" *She growled with widening eyes and jumped to the side, watching water splash past her.*

Holland: "..."

Freya: *She landed with ease and tilted her head in a curious manner, staring at Destiny, Fryfry and Twotters.* "Gruff?"

Twotters: (Freya-) *She leant forward, standing in a battle-ready pose.* (We will break the bond and allow you to be with us once more!)

Holland: "What are you talking about?" *He stared at Freya, watching her tribal-like patterns glow in a pulsating manner.*

Freya: (Flash Hound.) *She growled in a violent manner and flashstepped, appearing behind Destiny.*

Destiny: (Huh?)

Freya: (Ice Fang.) *She opened her jaw and two fluoro ragged beams bit into the back of Destiny's head, causing her to sneeze in pain.*

Destiny: (Arh!-) "Meheheeehee." *She bent on her back legs, kicking the air with her front hooves.*

Holland: (I can't-)

Twotters: (Soft Acoustics.) *Grey ribbons swirled around Freya, lowering her battle attributes.*

Freya: "Graff-" *She shut her jaw, causing the ice to shatter away.*

Destiny: *She quickly galloped away from Freya, causing the residue ice to shatter off her body.* (That hurt-)

Freya: (Sonic Roar.) *She raised her snout and howled upwards, causing a sphere of sound to ripple the party back.*

Holland: *He slid across the ground, intensely staring at Freya.* (My little girl is so powerful-)

Freya: *She lowered her head, watching the ribbons violently disintegrate into nothing.* "Graff!"

Twotters: *She elegantly slid on all fours, stopping next to Holland.* (Her roar was the opposing frequency, disrupting my Soft Acoustics!)

Fryfry: *The swarm buzzed in a disorientated-like manner.* (Holland!)

Holland: "When I connected the Soul Link with the three of you, I felt more understanding on how you felt. I realised my actions affected you all in different ways-"

Freya: (This is no time for speeches, you've always been a man of action!-)

Holland: "And that is probably what got me in this mess-"

Freya: "Grrr-r-r-r."

Fryfry: "Bzzst!" *They quickly swarmed around Holland in a wary manner.* (Her Neurons increased tenfold!)

Holland: (What-?!)

Freya: (Ougi!)

Destiny: "Meehee." *She sneezed and scraped her hooves into the ground, bracing herself with anticipation.*

Freya: *She suddenly gargled flames and stared at Holland with a growing body.* "Grarh!-"

Twotters: "Meow?" *She looked up, staring at Freya with a dropping jaw.*

Holland: (I've always been a man of action, and I always will be-)

Freya: *She looked down at the party, as two wings of fire flared out of her back.* "Horrand!"

Destiny: *Shadows flickered around her as Freya's wings lit up the area.* (The power of an Ancioldrant!-)

Holland: *He smiled as if he found a different resolve.* "I'm not going to change, but I can do things differently." *He shook his head and chuckled at himself, causing the party to look at him in confusion.*

Twotters: *She glanced at Holland, hissing in a worried manner.* (Has the stress caused him too much strain?)

Destiny: *She ignored the blood which ran down her neck from her back, watching the swarm of fireflies buzz around her.* (Is something wrong, Holland?)

Holland: "No." *He paused, glaring at Freya with confidence and determination.* "We can do this."

Freya: *She intensely stared at Holland, showing her teeth for intimidation.* "Horrand, if roo can't show me the shrength, then roo can't relrease the brond!"

Holland: "I don't know what bond you're talking about, but-" *He closed his eyes and visualised three orb-like pearls.*

Freya: (A wise speech won't give you a sudden powerup to fight me...) *She growled in thought, frowning at Holland.*

Holland: (When I understood my summons, I also understood a little about me-)

Freya: "Roo don't have the power!"

Holland: (This is too important for me to mess up.) *He continued to visualise the three pearls, watching blue strings materialise between the three, effectively connecting them to each other.*

Freya: "Horrand?!" *She stepped forward and prepared to attack, upset due to Holland's lack of response.*

Holland: "Freya, we'll always be together.." *He mumbled and opened his eyes.* "Hi-Ougi."

*Destiny, Fryfry and Twotters looked shocked, as Holland's markings glowed on their bodies.*

Freya: "Grwhat?" *She growled with a dropping jaw, watching a shade of blue shine on Destiny, Fryfry and Twotters' body.*

Holland: "Winds howl and swirl with your might-" *He shouted with an echoing voice, cueing Destiny to look up and flap her wings.*

Destiny: *She spiralled into the air and enthusiastically flapped her wings, blowing a strong tornado-like gale around Freya.* "Meeheeehee!"

Freya: *She watched the wind swirl around her, which suddenly lifted her hind legs up off the ground.* "Grah-?"

Twotters: *She braced herself in a trance-like manner, as if she knew what was happening.* "..."

Freya: *The tips of her claws scraped into the ground, as she continued to be lifted higher into the air.* (How-?! How could Holland do this in the short amount of time I left him?)

Holland: "Flashes come before me and slice-" *Fryfry became bright and flew at high speeds, causing lines of light to slash Freya.*

Freya: *She growled in a deep tone, squinting her eyes in pain.* "Grr." *Streaks of blood followed the lines of light, as Fryfry lightly sliced across her face and body.*

Holland: "Sound waves erupt the ground and explode-" *Twotters released a high-frequency screech, causing the ground to explode underneath Freya.*

Freya: *She looked down, watching a swirl of shard-like rocks float in the tornado-like gale.* "Grah-?!"

Holland: "SUMMONCE COMBO" *He shouted and watched the wind die down, dropping Freya and the shard-like rocks to the ground.*

Freya: *She crushed the rocks under her body, causing a pulse-like dirt cloud to blow around her.* (What? What just happened?)

Destiny: *She gently flapped her wings and landed beside Holland, kneeling down in an exhausted manner.* (Such power ran through my wings and being.)

Twotters: *She purred with fatigue, watching her whiskers retract.* "Meow.."

Holland: *He noticed Freya dwindle in size, as she lay motionless on the ground.* "F-Freya?"

Fryfry: *Several fireflies disintegrated, as they swarmed towards Holland.* (Her power is dwindling.)

Freya: *Her wings made of flames burnt out, causing the area to dim.* (Good-)

Holland: *He stepped forward in concern, causing Twotters to pounce in front of him.* "Huh-?"

Twotters: (Be on guard!)

Freya: (Seems like knowledge and instinct flows naturally to you now-) *She whimpered, coughing out flames.*

Fryfry: (She is no longer a threat.)

Freya: (Your heart and our bond, you will know what to do when you call my name.)

Holland: "Call your name-?"

*The party including Freya disintegrated into nothing, causing the area to revert back to normal.*

Holland: *He stood on the spot in confusion and noticed Sebastian walking towards him.* "I'm so confused-"

Sebastian: "You disappeared again."

Blake: *He inspected the walls, looking over his shoulder to Holland.* "The bitch must've confronted his summon as well, and without our help."

Sebastian: "You've been gone for about ten minutes." *He growled in an animal manner, checking to see if Holland was alright.*

Blake: *He smirked in respect and turned around, power walking towards Holland.* "Fufufu, not bad, hey."

Holland: "So, what happened?"

Blake: *He stopped in front of Holland and opened his hand, revealing several Acro Berries.* "You defeated your inner bitches."

Sebastian: "..."

Blake: *He shoved the berries into Holland's mouth and looked at his finger in disgust, wiping it on Holland's shirt.* "Eww-"

Holland: *He chewed on the Acro Berries, causing him to become alert with energy.* "What's going on?" *He leant up and placed his arms over his head, stretching his back.*

Sebastian: "Before you came in, we had just defeated Blake's crazy summon."

Blake: "Then you, like, totally disappeared, so I inspected the area."

Sebastian: "If you didn't come by the time we recovered our energy, we would've went back to get you."

Holland: *He looked at Sebastian, nodding his head in appreciation.* "So, where are we?"

Sebastian: "This is the last part of the pilgrimage." *He spread his arms and spun around, observing the blue lit area.*

Blake: "You weren't gone for long, so you haven't missed much."

Holland: *He stood in a casual manner, brushing dirt off his clothes.* "So, do we pray or do a tribe-like dance?"

Blake: "Fufufu, you really don't have a clue, aye."

Holland: "That kinda doesn't answer my question."

Sebastian: "We wait-" *He looked up to the ceiling, growling with a sigh.* "For the legendary Scoldrant."

Blake: *He faced Sebastian, walking up to him.* "Shouldn't we call it an Ancioldrant instead?"

Sebastian: "Well-"

Holland: *He looked at his hand, as their conversation became background noise.* (Freya-?)

*Holland placed his hand on his chest, frowning in thought.*

Holland: (My chest and markings hurt...) *He mumbled, triggering several flashbacks of his fight with Freya.* (I think I know what you meant now-)

*The area rumbled and vibrated, catching the party's attention.*

Holland: *He snapped out of his thought, looking at Blake and Sebastian.* "A tremor?!"

Sebastian: "No!-"
Blake: "It's here!" *He shouted with a slight hiss, causing the party to stand in battle-ready positions.* (Those Acro Berries Seb gave me were a lifesaver!)

Holland: "So what are we looking for?"

Sebastian: "You know the-"
Blake: "Haven't you been listening to a thing at all?! The firebird, the phoenix."

Holland: (Phoenix?) *He whispered in thought, reminiscing the times he had with Freya when she was younger.* (The legendary bird, of course!)

Blake: *He rolled his eyes at Holland, focusing his attention on his surroundings.* (I can feel its presence, but I don't know where. I'm kinda glad we're in the rite section, tho.)

Holland: (Maybe all this stress is giving me a strain.) *He held his head, scratching it with disorientation.*

Sebastian: "You alright?"

Holland: "Yeah." *He coughed, lowering his arms.* (I forgot the legendary bird. That's one of the reasons I followed Keno in the first place.)

Sebastian: "The tremors!-"
Blake: "Here it comes, bitches!"

*A bright, red phoenix emerged from the blue magma below and flew high into the air, lighting up the area.*

Sebastian: *He slightly squinted his eyes, staring at the figure made of flames.* (Its presence has made the area seem like day!)

Phoenix: (You have passed your inner selves, your bonds and Soul Links.)

Holland: (This creature is made of fire-?!)

Phoenix: (I am the Guardian of Turnback Cave and the keeper of The Staff of Memories. Considering you entered this route, you are Soul Linked-based creatures.)

Blake: "Oi, that sounds condescending!"

Sebastian: *He put his hand in front of Blake's face, motioning him to be quiet.* "Shh."

Phoenix: (In order to battle, it must be on my terms!)

Blake: "Say wha?! That's unfair!-"

Holland: "What are your terms?"

Blake: "Bitch, you're just gonna bow down to these terms?"

Sebastian: "Sshh." *He growled in a worried manner.*

Phoenix: (You are to fight with one summon each. If successful, I will grant a part of my power to those who desire it.) *Its voice echoed with the sounds of its burning wings.*

Sebastian: "Staff of Memories?" *He growled in confusion.*

Holland: (If Sebastian doesn't know, then we certainly wouldn't.)

Phoenix: (But I should not assume you're here for my power or to fight. What is it you desire?)

Sebastian: *He shook his head.* "No, you're right! But we aren't here for that staff."

Blake: "While we're here, why not get the staff as well?"

Sebastian: "Don't be greedy." *He grunted so only Holland and Blake could hear.*

Holland: "I agree with, Seb. Let's just do what we're meant to do-"

Blake: "Watevs, I guess the faster I don't have to see you, the better." *He rolled his eyes, placing one hand on his waist.* (Sorry, Rachael.)

Phoenix: *It screeched like an eagle and spread its fire wings, creating gusts of unimaginable heat.* (Then prove yourselves when you're ready!) *It kept a respectable distance, waiting for the party to make their move.*

Sebastian: "Right." *He bent forward and growled as his body started to transform.*

Holland: *He looked at Sebastian in shock, watching a coat of fur cover his body.* "H-Huh?"

Blake: "Did you think Seb was the only human looking one? Remember our talk from before, or weren't you listening to that either." *He hissed, watching Sebastian's nose and ears extend in an animal-like manner.*

Holland: (My head isn't with me right now-) *He shook his head in response, noticing Sebastian's completely new wolf-like form.* "Whoa, cool-"

Blake: "Righty, here goes nothin'." *He closed his eyes and opened his hand, kissing a materialising white pearl in his palm.*

Holland: (Your heart and our bond, you will know what to do when you call my name.) *Freya's words echoed in his mind.*

Sebastian: *He formed a fist, watching the muscles bulge in his arm.* (It's been a while since I fully released my inner Scoldrant.)

Holland: (My heart-) *He mumbled in thought, placing one hand on his chest.* (Our bond-) *He slowly exhaled, placing his other hand down onto his markings.* "Freya!" *He punched in front and touched his hands, causing a large purple glyph to spiral in front of him.*

Sebastian: *He growled and looked over his shoulder, glancing at Blake and Holland.* (They must be summoning their strongest ones.)

Holland: *He pushed forward and watched Freya jump out of the glyph, causing him to smile in shock.* "Freya-"

Freya: *She spun around and charged for Holland.* "Grrr-"

Holland: *He stared at Freya with a gasp, stepping back in shock.* (Was it too good to be true-?!)

Freya: "Grarh-" *She jumped up and pounced on top of Holland, knocking him onto the ground.*

Holland: "Freya, no-" *He squinted his eyes, tilting his head away.*

Freya: *She licked him all over his face.* (I missed you!)

Holland: *He slowly opened his eyes, chuckling with a widening smile.* (I've missed you, too!-)

*A golden swirl warped around a woman in holy armour, catching Holland and Freya's attention.*

?????: "Blake, this better be important, thy was talking to Ginger, Rachael and Luna."

Blake: "Oh, Arcadia bitch, this is important." *He looked past Arcadia and nudged his head, causing her to turn around.*

Arcadia: "Impudence-" *She stepped back as the phoenix's light shimmered off her armour.*

*Holland and Freya walked in between Arcadia and Sebastian, staring at the phoenix.*

Sebastian: "Are you ready?" *He looked at the party, waiting for their response.*

Phoenix: *It looked down, staring at Holland, Blake, Sebastian, Freya and Arcadia.* "Will this be the party to fight me?"

Sebastian: "Yes!"
Holland: "Yeah!"
Blake: "Damn rite, bitch!"

Arcadia: (Fighting such a powerful foe, thy better be careful. Blake, thou insolent fool! Thy wasn't expecting something like this!)

Freya: "Ruff!" *She barked at the phoenix, growling with confidence.*

Phoenix: *Blue flames erupted underneath it, covering its entire body.* "Be on guard, fellow creatures connected to nature's life." *The blue flames died out and revealed a miniature version of the phoenix.*

Blake: "Why did it shrink in size? It would've been easier to attack us when it was huge-"

Arcadia: "Don't give it ideas, thou insolent fool." *A halberd materialised in her hand.* "By the holy laws thou shall be taken care of!"

Holland: *He looked at Arcadia with a strange look.* (What kind of summon is she-?)

Freya: (Holland, don't get distracted. We've finally been reunited, so I don't want-)

Holland: "Say no more, I got it." *His words boosted Freya's morale, causing her to wag her tail.*

Phoenix: *It screeched and flapped its wings of fire.* "Show me what you've got." *It dived towards the party, burning the air in its path.*

Blake: "Let's do this!"

Arcadia: (Thy would usually say a confident taunt, but this creature is a protector of one of the weapons.)

Sebastian: *He gritted his wolf-like teeth.* "I can handle this-"

Arcadia: "It must be a team effort!"
Blake: "No you can't!"

Holland: "Don't try and be the hero."

Sebastian: "Grah-?"
Holland: *He ran in front of the party, frowning with anticipation.* "Freya!"

Freya: *She jumped over the party, landing in front of Holland.* (Gargling Whirlpool.) *She barked a vortex of water towards the phoenix.*

Arcadia: (Water? Those types of Scoldrants usually breathe out fire!) *She watched the phoenix dive into the water, causing the vortex to instantly evaporate.*

Sebastian: *He noticed the phoenix's dive lose no speed towards the party.* "Get out of the way!"

*Holland and Freya responded and jumped to the side out of the phoenix's path.*

Phoenix: "Kreeeeii." *A blaze-like trail scorched past the party, as it flew past at amazing speeds.*

Blake: *Flames danced on the ground next to him.* "How are we meant to touch something that's completely covered in fire?!"

Sebastian: "I knew it was a phoenix, but the chief never mentioned its entire self was made of fire."

Holland: (Freya's attack had no effect at all!) *He tightened his body in a worried manner.*

Freya: (Holland, we've been through so much-) *She growled in recollection, triggering images of Zayden's attack piercing Holland's chest.* (When I saw you like that, the power that released in me-)

Holland: *He looked up in recollection as if he viewed her memory too.* (I see-)

Freya: (I can't grasp that power freely, but-)

Holland: (But maybe I can!)

Freya: "Gruff!"

Phoenix: *It spiralled through the air and dived directly down towards Blake.* "Krreeii."

Blake: *He looked up in shock.* "Oh shi-"

*A wave of fire exploded on top of Blake, causing Sebastian and Arcadia to slide back.*

Arcadia: "Blake!" *Splinters of flames scorched past her.*

Blake: "Arcadia, I'm good." *He flashstepped behind Holland and coughed, as parts of his clothes smoked due to the flames.*

Holland: *He watched a burst of flames circle in the area the phoenix dived on.* "It lost its shape-"

Arcadia: "Thou are good?" *She watched Blake pat out the smoke on his leathered garments.* (Why did thou just stand there?)

Blake: (I just wasn't like, expecting it alrite?!)

Sebastian: *He squinted his eyes as the separation of flames caused the area to brighten.* (I never imagined it would look like this!)

Blake: *He paused as if he was waiting for something to happen.* "Its body exploded-?"

Holland: "Maybe we won?"

Arcadia: "Unlikely. All three of thou should be able to grasp the feeling of life Neurons! Don't be foolish."

Blake: (The bitch is rite. I can feel the Ancioldrant's Neurons loud and clear-)

Sebastian: (How did the chief fight something like that!-)

Phoenix: *Its beak and wings emerged from the flames and the fire swirled around, forming the bird-like body.* "You all are quite diverse."

Arcadia: "Take note, Holland Breeze."

Blake: "Spoke too soon, bitch." *He hissed at Holland while keeping focus on the phoenix.*

Arcadia: *She noticed the phoenix's distorted figure.* "An opportunity! Serenity Burst." *She pointed forward and a burst of light popped around the phoenix's wing.*

Phoenix: *It screeched, as the wing vanquished with the light.* "Light?"

Sebastian: "That got him!" *He noticed the damage Arcadia caused on the phoenix, growling in accomplishment.*

Blake: "Him? I actually can't sense its gender."

Sebastian: "It was-"

Arcadia: "Just a figure of speech." *She spoke as if she knew what Sebastian was going to say.*

Sebastian: (That fight we had with her. I feel better having her as our ally now.)

Phoenix: *It flapped its fiery wings and faced the party.* "Hmmm."

Arcadia: "Everyone, stand in battle-ready poses!" *She shouted while spiralling the halberd with an open hand.*

Phoenix: *It looked at Arcadia.* "Despite being a summon, a Sacred Knight is not welcome in these trials-"

Blake: "Wait, no!-"

Arcadia: *She squinted her eyes with a displeased appearing face.* (Thy have no intentions of leaving.)

Phoenix: (Really?)

Arcadia: (Blake Hegarty with the assistance of Sebastian Morena completed the trial, thus unlocking the use of my abilities and power in this fight.)

Phoenix: *Arcadia's words echoed in its mind.* (I respect this-)

Arcadia: *She glanced around her, noticing time had frozen in the area.* (It surely does not sound like thou are respecting this.)

Phoenix: (Unless you were obtaining the staff, I cannot allow someone of your power to assist them in this fight.)

Arcadia: (Explain why?)

Phoenix: (Because they would easily win.)

Arcadia: *She looked surprised.* (And therefore, they will not truly earn the importance of winning.) *She nodded her head once as if she understood where the phoenix was coming from.*

Phoenix: *It noticed Blake, Holland, Sebastian and Freya not moving.* (In a Spacial Funnel?)

Arcadia: (The Voice of On's Astragons, it allows me to create spatial alterations in our thoughts.)

Phoenix: (You prove my point furthermore.)

Arcadia: *She smiled.* (Understood.)

Blake: "-We had to fight-"

Phoenix: *It noticed the sounds of popping magma, cueing it to focus back to the party.* (Thank you for understanding.)

Sebastian: *He growled with twitching whiskers.* "I agree! You can't just dictate what summon you want to fight-"

Phoenix: *A plume of flames erupted from its side, forming a wing.* "CELESTRIAL LANCER" *It flapped its wings and hundreds of swords formed around Arcadia, causing the party to gasp.*

Arcadia: *She stared at the solid appearing swords, lowering her halberd.* "Thy accept your desire."

Blake: *He hissed in shock.* (That bitch doesn't even want to help me.)

Arcadia: *She looked at Blake in an apologetic manner.* "This is a sacred event held for Scoldrant Users, despite my being, thy am still not welcome."

Blake: "Watevs." *He hissed, hiding his disappointment.*

Arcadia: "..." *She closed her eyes and disintegrated into the air, causing a white pearl to form into Blake's hand.*

Blake: *He looked down and hissed.* "..."

Phoenix: "She made the right choice-"

Blake: *He looked up with a growing frown.* "I said, watevs!" *He squeezed the pearl and felt it disappear, before charging towards the phoenix.*

Phoenix: *It tilted its head, causing the swords to flare down at Blake.* "I used to be the Guardian of this entire continent!"

Blake: *He started to flip and cartwheel towards the phoenix, watching the swords of fire jab into the ground around him.* "You think I care!?"

Holland: "Freya, help him!"

Freya: *She stared at Blake, triggering flashbacks of their previous fight.* (Why-?)

Holland: (Right now he's part of the party!) *His words caused her to disregard her feelings.*

Freya: "Growlith!" *She charged towards Blake, digging her nails into the rock to increase her speed.*

Sebastian: (I can reduce my body weight to that of a leaf!-) *He growled and bent his knees, jumping high into the air.*

Blake: *He flashsided several feet, allowing him to weave and avoid the other fire swords.* (I could still win anyway!)

Sebastian: (Compared to those two, my natural abilities topple theirs, but having partners-) *He watched Freya hop to each side, closely avoiding the bright swords, which burst into flames upon touching the ground.*

Holland: *He focused, causing his tribal-like markings to glow on Freya, further boosting her speed.* (I can now help my summons! And to think I had this ability the entire time!)

Sebastian: *He looked down across the battlefield, glancing at each party member.* (I admire my cousins.)

Blake: "Fufufu, this is nothing-"

Phoenix: *It swayed its wing, causing several swords to predict Blake's somersaulting.* "Got you."

Blake: *He looked up with widening eyes and stared at the swords move towards him in slow motion.* (I'm not touching the ground, I can't flashstep!-)

Freya: (Sonic Roar.) *She rolled to the side and barked out a visible shockwave, causing the falling swords above Blake to explode into flames.*

Blake: (Yuck!) *He landed on his hands and flicked his feet, observing his shadows flash on the ground due to the brightness caused by the explosion.*

Holland: (That was close.)

Blake: "Thanks!" *He flipped onto his feet and ran with his arms behind his back, as his body glowed a shade of blue.*

Freya: "Gruff!" *She barked in appreciation and leant back, jumping around several swords.*

Blake: (These damned swords!-)

Phoenix: "CELESTRIAL LANCER" *It screeched and waved its wing, firing off more swords made of solidified fire.*

Blake: (I'm not a fan of using my Azure Bursts, but here we go! I didn't become a captain solely on using my summons and abilities!-) "Sonida Lotus." *He spun around and swayed his arms as an orange wind-like aura swirled around him.*

Freya: *She noticed Blake suddenly stop in one spot, causing him to become vulnerable to the swords.* (Gargling Whirlpool.) *She aimed her snout, before barking out a vortex of water towards Blake.*

Sebastian: *He looked down and noticed the swords flare into striking distance around Blake.* (It's going to-)

*Water spiralled around Blake shielding him from the phoenix's attack.*

Holland: "Nice work, Freya!"

Blake: (I didn't need her help, but I totes appreciate it!) *He tightened his hand, causing the aura to form a massive fist around his arm.*

Sebastian: (Roharnia?!)

Blake: "Niyah!" *He punched forward, causing the aura to burst all the swords in its path towards the phoenix.*

Holland: "Whoa-"
Sebastian: "Grah?!"
Freya: "Gruff!" *They shouted and barked in shock, watching the water sprinkle in the multiple bursts of flames.*

Phoenix: (My Celestrial Lancer!)

Blake: *He looked up with a tiring hiss and noticed a path of fiery rings leading directly towards the phoenix.* (A clear path!-)

*Blake started to run directly towards the phoenix again, materialising a small green-coloured orb in his palm.*

Phoenix: *It faced Blake, opening its beak.* "FLAME BOLT" *It screeched out a massive fireball directly towards Blake.*

Blake: (Its Neurons and Astragons are crazy, but at least I can expect only fire Rostical-) *He stopped in mid-thought and hissed in disbelief.*

Sebastian: *He gasped, quickly focusing on his extending nails.* "Supersonic Scratch." *He pointed down and scratched the fireball, splitting it in two.*

Blake: *He watched splinters of fire blow past him.* (A long-ranged Azure Burst-) *He looked over his shoulder, glancing up at Sebastian before quickly focusing in front.* (Who woulda thought that Seb was experienced enough to manipulate his falling speed due to Astragons.)

Holland: *He watched the swirls of fire blow past Blake's sides in amazement.* "Whoa, Seb cut it from all the way other there!-"

Sebastian: (I've got your back, Blake.) *He growled to himself in thought.*

Blake: "Harh!" *A Spacial Funnel warped behind him and vines shot out past him, whipping towards the phoenix.*

Phoenix: *It clapped its wings and a pulse of flames burnt the vines before it even touched it.* "Such a waste of Neurons-"

Blake: *He flashstepped directly in front of the phoenix, sliding along the ground.* "Y'know, I've always been picked on, you think I'd let some Scoldrant tell me otherwise what I can and can't do?!" *He squinted his eyes due to being close to the phoenix.*

Phoenix: "Suicidal!"

Freya: *She spread her legs, digging her claws into the ground.* (Sonic Roar.)

Sebastian: (Blake's charging another Azure Burst, but he better be quick! The phoenix will not let him charge his attack!) *He looked down to his feet, noticing they started to shake.* (I won't be able to stay up here for much longer.)

Blake: "They say this Azure Burst feels like a barrage of punches! Three finger snap-flashing fist strike." *He pointed his fingers and started to poke them at fast speeds.*

Sebastian: *He started to fall down, noticing small pockets of flames explode from the phoenix's back.* (If this doesn't work, I'll have to use my attack I've kept hidden even from the chief.)

Phoenix: *Small bursts of flames exploded from its back due to Blake's attacks.* (I'm staggered! I can't attack!)

Blake: *His fingers became red and started to burn.* "That's it-" *He backflipped away from the phoenix and spiralled in the air, barely avoiding a shockwave-like bark.* "Wah-"

Freya: "Gruff!" *She barked in an apologetic manner.*

Phoenix: *It looked down and noticed the holes in its chest caused by Blake's attack.* "Damage caused by your mere fingers-"

Blake: *He landed on his feet and slid back, watching the shockwave hit the phoenix.* "Tssk-"

*The shockwave violently exploded into flames, blasting one of the phoenix's wings off.*

Blake: "Oi, tell the stupid Scoldrant to watch out, that nearly hit me!" *He awkwardly hunched forward and watched the wing hit the ground, as he attempted to ignore the burning sensation in his fingers.*

Freya: (I didn't mean for it to be that close!) *Her growls echoed in Holland's mind.*

Holland: "It was an accident-" *He glanced at Blake, pointing to the phoenix.* "Not now."

Blake: *He wiped sweat off his forehead with his forearm as he attempted to ignore the burning sensation in his fingers.* (It hurts-)

Freya: (It worked?) *She watched fire slowly swirl around the phoenix, forming into a wing.* (It keeps recovering!) *She growled at the phoenix with a dropping jaw.*

Holland: *He gritted his teeth, frowning in thought.* "What next?"

Blake: (It takes the damage, but its regeneration, it's way way way too fast!)

Sebastian: "Pyrenees Distant Maul." *He sliced downwards and sword-like claws sliced the phoenix in half.*

Blake: "Sexy, Seb! Fufufu." *He giggled in amazement, watching metallic vine-like nails sway in the air.*

Holland: *He watched Sebastian's claws retract and their metallic-like appearance fade.* "What kind of technique was that?"

Sebastian: "Grr-rah." *He harshly landed on the ground and casually stepped back, as if he felt no recoil.* "My inner ability. I can control my body to any way I want."

Blake: *He took a deep breath and wiped sweat off his face, looking at the phoenix with uncertainty.* "We did it?"

Phoenix: *The fire stopped separating and swayed back, slowly merging back together.* "Now I shall attack-"

Holland: (Freya, can you feel that?)

Freya: (Those Neuron signatures! It now has killing intent!)

Sebastian: *He growled in shock, tensing his shoulders.* "No! Ougi."

Blake: (His Ougi! He didn't get to properly utilise it when we fought Arcadia-)

Sebastian: "Kararehe Mana."

Holland: *He watched Sebastian grow in size.* (It doesn't feel like I'm contributing much to this fight!) *He formed fists.*

Freya: *She intensely stared at the phoenix with heightened vision.* (His attack didn't work! It keeps healing!)

Holland: (Dang it!) *He intensely stared at Freya, causing blue strings to become visible.* "I think we can do this, Freya."

Blake: *He noticed the strings in the corner of his eye, drawing his attention to Holland and Freya.* (Wow, look how many links there are between those two.)

Sebastian: *He frizzed his fur and showed his canine-like teeth, tightening his claws in an aggressive manner.* "Grarh!"

Holland: *He closed his eyes and visualised three pearls.* (I'm not sure if this is okay-) *He visualised Freya, watching the blue strings around her react to his thoughts.* (But I want us all to be together-)

*Blue strings shot out from Freya and connected into the pearls, causing Freya to growl in pain.*

Sebastian: *He watched his claws shine like metal, before sprinting towards the phoenix.* "Grarhh!"

Freya: *She watched the strings become darker in colour, before transforming into golden strings, causing both her and Holland pain.* "Kark-"

Blake: (The colour?!) *He hissed in thought with widening eyes.*

Holland: (They're-.. They're golden-?) *He frowned in pain, holding his breath.*

Freya: *She slowly staggered next to Holland, listening to the sounds of swords scraping against each other, as Sebastian moved his hands at incredible speeds.* "Growlith?"

Holland: (Freya-) *Freya's ear twitched, causing him to touch his ear in shock.*

Freya: (Our Soul Link has become even stronger?)

Phoenix: "FLAMING PILLARS" *It screeched and waved its regenerated wings at Sebastian.*

Sebastian: *He dodged lines of fire in an animal-like manner, slashing past the phoenix.* (No matter what I do-)

Holland: (I can feel.. Everything.) *He thought to himself in amazement, intensely staring at Freya.*

Sebastian: *He slid back and turned around, pouncing towards the phoenix with his arms in front.* (-It keeps regenerating!)

Blake: *He stared at the golden strings with widening eyes.* (I've only seen a golden Soul Link twice, one was Keno and the other was Cameron-)

Phoenix: *It quickly flew upwards and extended its wings, flapping a tunnel of flames downwards towards Sebastian.* "Raiding Blaze."

Sebastian: "Gra-?!"

*An explosion of blue flames knocked Sebastian into the air and towards the party, catching Blake, Holland and Freya's attention.*

Sebastian: "..." *He tumbled past Blake and scraped along the ground, growling in pain.*

Blake: *He turned around in shock.* "?!"

Sebastian: (This power.. I need... I need to complete this pilgrimage.)

Blake: *His back faced the phoenix, causing his face to slightly darken.* "Seb?!" *He stared at Sebastian who rolled unconscious on the ground.*

Holland: "Is he-?"

Freya: *Her ear twitched.* (No, I can hear his heartbeat.)

Holland: *He gently touched his earlobe, nodding his head in agreement.* (Me too.)

Blake: (I'm tired of being so weak and watching the people who're actually nice to me get hurt!) "I'm gonna get you!"

*Blake hissed in an angry manner and started to puff through his teeth, pumping himself up with confidence.*

Blake: "Ougi." *He turned around and faced the phoenix, forming fists.* "Huh-?!"

*The phoenix hovered directly in front of Blake, lighting up his face and the surrounding area.*

Phoenix: (You don't even possess an Ougi right now.)

Blake: (I can combine all my summons-)

Phoenix: (Burn!) *It spread its wings and flapped them in a clap-like manner.*

Holland: *His face lit up due to a fiery explosion around Blake's head.* (When did the phoenix get in such close-range?!) "Blake!"

Blake: "Grh-" *A swirl of fire wrapped itself around his head, causing him to lose consciousness.*

Phoenix: (A critical hit and you still wield an Astragon layer around your body? I had anticipated to burn your flesh-)

Holland: "Let's do it my best friend. My little girl."

Freya: "Ruff!"

Holland: "Ougi." *The golden strings became transparent and invisible.* "Ancioldrant Freya." *Glyphs formed around Freya, causing her to grow in size.*

Phoenix: (This human has acquired the final bond with his partner?)

Freya: "Prick on somerone your own wrize." *Fire exploded out of her back, forming two magnificent wings.*

Holland: *He quickly sighed, noticing his knees buckle.* (My legs are feeling heavy..)

Freya: (Flash Hound.) *She flashstepped into the air above the phoenix.* (Ice Fang.) *Her teeth glowed a shade of fluoro blue and two streams shot down towards the phoenix.*

Holland: (Freya's so fast, it doesn't even know where she is-)

Phoenix: *It spun around, as it scouted for Freya's location.* (Where-?) *Strings of water splashed on its head, as the heat expelled from its body melted the ice.* "Up?"

Freya: *She pounced down and violently landed on the ground, causing the rock to crumble around her paws.* (Aerial Pounce.) *Swirls of fire stringed around her, as the phoenix's shape broke in two.*

Holland: (She pounced right through its body!-) *He smiled in astonishment, keeping his focus on Freya.*

Phoenix: "Gravel and sand manipulate to my command, move like a drill and make them feel-"

Freya: (Tangrowth Slash.) *Her claws extended and swivelled like vines.*

Phoenix: "COMET'S VEIL" *It suddenly blasted a comet-like boulder out of its body towards Freya.*

Freya: "Crah!-" *She twitched her legs and her claws swirled around her like a whirlwind, effectively slashing the fireball around her.*

Holland: "Freya, do what I did with Destiny's attack!-" *He shouted, recalling the time Destiny combined Twotters' sound attack with her silver wind.* "Use your Sonic Roar and combine it with the water!"

Freya: (Gargling Flaming Wheel.) *Liquid-like flames dripped out of her mouth and she barked, causing a vortex of fire to burn the phoenix's fire.*

Holland: "No water!"

Freya: (Sonic Roar-) *She quickly barked out a shockwave, blasting the phoenix's head into a swirl of flames.*

Holland: "Keep it up!"

Freya: (Flash Hound.) *She flashstepped into the distance and dug her claws into the ground, causing her to instantly stop.*

Holland: (She's so fast!-. Over there!-) *He quickly looked to his side, staring at Freya.*

Freya: (Sonic Roar.) *She awkwardly tilted her head back, as if she was holding the shockwave back.*

Holland: (Now combine it!)

Freya: (Gargling Whirlpool.) *She looked at the distorted image of the phoenix and barked out a blast of sonic water, which moved as fast as an arrow.*

Holland: *He watched the force behind Freya's attack move the dirt on the ground.* "Wow-"

*The high pressured swirl of water shot straight through the phoenix, hitting the wall behind it, causing several rocks to tumble into the blue magma.*

Freya: *She stuck her tongue out and panted, watching steam sizzle off the phoenix's body.* "Gerahh.."

Holland: "Good work!" *He watched strings of flames spiral where the phoenix was.* "It put out most of the phoenix's fire!"

Phoenix: "Never in such encounters has a mere Scoldrant reduced me to this extent-" *Its voice echoed from the small traces of fire.*

Holland: (She's getting weak, I can feel it-)

Phoenix: "But, not good enough-"

Holland: "What?!"
Freya: "Gruff?!"

Phoenix: "Kreeeeii." *Blue flames erupted out from the rock in the ground and merged into its fire, slowly forming into a bird-like figure.*

Holland: (It still can recover-?!)

Freya: "Horrand, rym done.." *She watched the blue phoenix flap its wings, before focusing her attention to Holland.*

Holland: (It's blue now?) *He gritted his teeth, watching his sweat drip off his hands.*

Freya: "Horrand?!"

Holland: "Okay-" *He looked up, bracing himself with determination.* "Hi-Ougi."

Phoenix: *It faced Holland, watching its flames move in a fluid manner.* (I haven't had time to stabilise the fire to form my entity yet-)

Holland: *He shouted with enthusiasm, throwing three pearls into the air.* "Winds howl and swirl with your might-"

*Destiny materialised into the air and flapped her wings, causing a tornado-like gale to appear around the phoenix.*

Blake: *He started to regain consciousness.* "Huh?" *He noticed the wind push the phoenix up into the air with widening eyes.*

Holland: "Flashes come before me and slice-" *Destiny disintegrated and Fryfry materialised around the phoenix.*

*The swarm became bright and flew at high speeds, causing lines of light to slash the phoenix.*

Blake: (It really is similar to my summons.. I haven't used my Ougi in a long time-) *He watched the fireflies disintegrate into the air.*

Holland: *Twotters materialised in the air above Holland.* "Sound waves erupt the ground and explode-"

*Twotters released a high-frequency screech, causing the ground to explode underneath the phoenix.*

Sebastian: *He moaned and twitched as he slowly regained consciousness.* "Argh.."

Freya: (I know what to do.)

Holland: "Follow by your epic down-ward waves of fire-" *Freya leapt high above the tornado and look down to the phoenix, as her wings of fire extended.*

Freya: "Grah-" *She enthusiastically flapped downwards, causing a volcanic-like eruption to blast towards the ground.*

Sebastian: *He stood up with a cough and slowly walked towards Holland in pain, watching the fire swirl with the wind.* (What a neat follow-up of each attack.)

Holland: "SUMMONCE COMBO"

*Freya dived down and flapped her wings of fire, elegantly landing next to Holland and Sebastian.*

Freya: "Ruff!" *She wagged her tail in confidence, watching her wings extinguish.*

Holland: *He looked at Sebastian in a worried manner.* "How are you feeling? You took a big hit."

Blake: "Yea, wat he said." *He hissed with a smirk of respect.*

Sebastian: "I'm alright-"

Phoenix: "I must commend your efforts, but that still isn't enough-"

Holland: "What?!" *He dropped his shoulders in disbelief, watching the strings of blue flames slowly merge back together.*

Blake: "After all that?!"
Sebastian: "No way!"

Blake: "..." *He sniffed with growing determination.*

Freya: "Gerwooo..." *She whined in a defeated manner.*

Blake: "Ougi." *He strutted towards the phoenix and eight pearls materialised in the air around him.*

Holland: "Blake?"

----------

Chief: *He panted, as sweat ran down his hairy cheek.* "They're standing their ground against the phoenix."

Keno: *He gasped.* "They're already fighting it?!"

Chief: *He nodded his head with a face full of concentration.* "All three might actually survive!"

Keno: (Thank The Astral Plains.) *He smiled with excitement and relief.*

----------

Blake: "Phew-" *He backflipped away from the phoenix and its flames, landing next to the party in exhaustion.*

Sebastian: "Whoa." *He growled in shock, staring at Blake in an impressed manner.*

Blake: "They were pretty sexy, rite?"

Holland: "Wow, that was like mine, but with eight different combos."

Blake: *He took deep breaths, dropping to his knees.* "Well, I do try, hey."

Holland: *He focused his attention back in front, noticing the phoenix slowly regaining its body image.* "Again?!"

Phoenix: (It looks like I'm nearing my limit too-)

Blake: *He whimpered and stood on all fours as if it was a struggle to hold himself up.* (Yuck! This Rasticsplash or side-effects to using that Ougi takes its toll on me. I forgot why I hardly use it. And now that my sexy cripple is in it too-)

Sebastian: "Hi-Ougi." *He growled like a lion and sprinted at the phoenix.*

Blake: *He looked at Sebastian with a squinted eye.* (Wat he just say?)
Holland: "Hi-Ougi? I thought he couldn't summon."

Blake: "I dunno, he's a little different from us if you hadn't noticed."

Holland: (He's right. How are you holding up, Freya?)

Freya: (I'm very tired, but I will keep going!) *She gritted her teeth, struggling to hide her exhaustion.*

Sebastian: (Use the Scoldrant within me-) *He noticed the area fade into darkness, causing him to suddenly stop.*

Holland: "Why did he stop?"

Blake: "I dunno, ask him aye." *He spoke with awkward puff-like pauses, rolling his eyes.*

Sebastian: *He jumped to the side and adjusted his position, lining himself up with the phoenix.* (Focus-) *He looked at his nails, watching the air warp around them.*

Blake: "It's like dark, so, he must be using his Hi-Ougi, hey."

Holland: "You're right.."

Sebastian: "Hypersonic Slash." *He raised his hand and enthusiastically slashed downwards.*

*A loud glass-like screech cut downwards and exploded the ground into a 'V' shape, causing the fire of the phoenix to extinguish.*

Freya: "Growlith?!" *She yelped in shock, staring at Sebastian's back in disbelief.*
Blake: "Yikes!"
Holland: (It was an aura-based attack, but I didn't see any visible Roharnia.)

Sebastian: (My Ougi and Hi-Ougi are similar-) *He turned around and faced the party, causing the area to revert back to normal.*

Blake: *He looked past Sebastian, observing the area behind him.* (There are no more flames?!)

Holland: *He smiled in accomplishment.* "We did it?"

Blake: "'Bout time." *He smirked in a cocky manner, struggling to stand up straight.*

Sebastian: *He panted in an animal-like manner and dragged his feet towards the party, noticing steam swirl around the nails of the hand he used.* "So now we should gain access to the item."

Blake: *His legs buckled slightly.* "That was harder than I thought."

Sebastian: *He shook his head in disagreement.* "I thought it would've been harder."

Blake: "Pfft." *He folded his arms, looking away.*

Sebastian: "Thank you."

Holland: "You're welcome?" *He faced Sebastian, looking at him in confusion.*
Blake: (Why's he thanking us?)

Sebastian: "I can't believe I was going to do it all alone-"

Phoenix: "Why so excited? Who said you won?" *Flames strung up from the ground and its entire entity appeared above the party.*

Holland: "No." *He mumbled under his breath, looked up with a gasp.*

Blake: *His eyes widened.* "How can we stop this thing?" (My Ougi allowed me to summon them, but-)

*Blake opened and closed his hand, causing him to shake his head with frustration.*

Blake: (I can't summon anything else! If only I had my sexy Amanda with me!) *He hissed in thought, frowning at the phoenix.*

Sebastian: *He looked at his claws, noticing charcoal grazes and slashes engraved on them.* (I'm nearing my-..) *He thought in a weary manner, slowly lowering his arms in defeat.*

Holland: "..." *He stood in silence as if he gave up the will to fight.*

Freya: (Holland, what's with that look?!) *She trotted in front of the party and lowered her head, growling to catch their attention.*

Holland: *He looked down and smiled at Freya, glancing at the party with boosted morale.* "I'm not going to give up-"

Blake: (Wha-?)

Holland: *He walked next to Freya and faced Blake and Sebastian, forming fists.* "If you two aren't?"

Blake: *He smirked with respect, nodding his head.* "I ain't giving up either!" *He strutted next to Holland and stood by his side.*

Sebastian: *He growled in agreement and looked up to the phoenix, walking next to Blake.* "As a member of the last tribe of my kind, I won't give up!"

Holland: "As a member of an endangered kind, I won't-" *He took a deep breath.* "-I can't give up!"

Blake: "And coming from someone who doesn't know wat he's a member of! Me neither!"

Phoenix: *The sounds of its scorching wings could be heard.* "You three must've trained a long time to reach this point-"

Blake: "Damn rite we did, bitch!"

Holland: "Haha, what he said!"

Sebastian: "Grrrah!" *He growled in a supportive manner.*

Phoenix: "I deem you all worthy."

*The party suddenly gasped in a triumphant manner and looked at each other, readying to celebrate.*

Phoenix: "But, I only have power to give the reward to one person." *The phoenix's offer caused the party to gasp in betrayal.*

Blake: *He looked down and paused in thought, suddenly forming fists in anger.* (I wanted to find where it is-)

Holland: "I'm fine with either Blake or Sebastian to have whatever it is." *He spoke in a deep voice, placing his hands on his head.*

Sebastian: "Huh?" *He looked at Holland as if he was a fool.*
Blake: "..." *He hissed in thought, glancing at Holland in disgust.*

Holland: "I got my reward." *He smiled in fatigue and bent down, scratching Freya behind the ear.*

Blake: "..." *His disgusted look slowly turned into a smile.*

Freya: "Gruff!"

Blake: (Seb, the impression he's given me this entire time... This thing means more to him than me.) *He looked at himself angry and started to walk away.* (This is so unfair!)

Sebastian: "W-Where are you going?"

Blake: "I don't care about this stupid thing, so watevs."

Sebastian: *He closed his eyes and relaxed, causing his body to slowly revert back to human.* "I can't explain how much I appreciate this."

Holland: "Don't be-"

Phoenix: *It slowly flapped to the side, facing Holland.* "Please leave."

Holland: *He nodded his head and turned around, watching Blake leave his sight.* "Freya." *He mumbled and started to walk away, causing her to trot by his side.*

Phoenix: (Despite encountering many bad people rudely demanding my power, it's nice to see people like this-) "Come." *It spoke to Sebastian with authority, slowly descending to the ground.*

Sebastian: *His eyes watered in happiness, as he stared at Holland and Freya's back.* "Thank you again! If you two don't leave the village before I get back, tell the chief I-"

Holland: *He stopped at the cave-like entrance, looking over his shoulder to Sebastian.* "Yeah?"

Sebastian: "We did it!"

Holland: *He nodded his head in response and smiled, walking into the cave.* (Freya.)

Freya: (Yes?) *She quickly trotted into the dark cave, causing her eyes and markings to light up.*

Holland: (I'm happy to have you back.)

Freya: (I'm happy too-) *She instinctively sniffed the air, focusing her attention ahead.* (Where did Blake go? I can smell his scent, he's not far away.)

Holland: (He can flashstep, I'm surprised he still could after that battle.) *He looked down the tunnel, squinting his eyes.* (Even with my heightened vision, it's really hard to see-)

Freya: (Why did he leave like that?)

Holland: (Maybe his personality?) *He shrugged his shoulders and glanced at Freya, admiring her glowing tribal markings.* (That was probably the only way he could deal with giving something up.)

----------

Blake: *He flashstepped outside Turnback Cave, instantly dropping to his knees in exhaustion.* (If I couldn't track my own foot imprints, I would've got lost in the darkness-)

*Blake punched the dirt and whined in a feminine manner.*

Blake: (I was so close to finding the location-) *He slowly exhaled and lost consciousness, falling face-first into the dirt.*

----------

*Fireflies lit up the cave and buzzed outside Turnback Cave.*

Holland: *He walked out and instantly noticed Blake lying motionless on the ground.* (So he did make it out-) *He stepped forward and bent down, flipping Blake onto his back.*

Freya: "Gruff?"

Holland: *He gently nudged Blake on the cheek in a manly manner.* "Hey, man."

Freya: (You shouldn't move people when they're unconscious-)

Holland: "Oops." *He looked at Freya, pulling an awkward face.*

Blake: (Why I defy nature? I was born like this-) *He whimpered and started to regain consciousness.* "Wah?"

Holland: *He observed Blake's eyes, ensuring he was okay.* "You alright-?"

Blake: *He slapped Holland across the face and rolled back, causing Freya to growl.* "I-I'm fine." *He stood up, brushing dirt off his chest in an annoyed manner.*

Holland: "Are you coming back to the village?"

Blake: "Why? So I can tell them I failed?" *He hissed and looked away.*

Freya: "Grrr." *She growled as if she was talking.*

Holland: *He looked at Freya, slightly chuckling in response.* "Freya-"

Blake: *He glanced between Freya and Holland before looking slightly paranoid.* "Wat's so funny?"

Holland: "She said she wants someone with intelligence to come back to the village with us."

Freya: "Gruff!" *She barked in agreement.*

Blake: *He smirked and paused, scratching under his arm in modesty.* "Watevs." *He turned around and started to walk towards the village, suddenly dropping with buckling knees.*

Freya: *She stared at Blake, causing the purple ring to spiral around her iris.* (There's an Astragon disturbance around his legs.)

Holland: (Got it-)

Blake: "Dammit." *He hissed, hitting his feet.*

Holland: *He closed his eyes and Destiny flew out of a yellow glyph which instantly appeared in the air.* "Hey, hop on her."

Blake: *He watched Destiny land in front of him, staring at her intimidated.* "W-What? Why?"

Holland: "Go on, she won't bite."

Freya: "Growlith." *She flapped her feathered wings, which materialised and grew in size.*

Destiny: "Meeheeehee." *She trotted up to Blake and leant to one side, allowing him easy access to her back.*

Blake: "Well, if ya need someone intelligent to come with-" *He awkwardly stood up, placing his hand on Destiny's back.*

Holland: "And it beats walking any day." *He carefully straddled Freya, causing her to flap off the ground.*

Blake: "Yea." *He hopped on Destiny as if he had experience doing so.*

Holland: *He watched sand and dirt pulse away from under Freya.* "Alright, let's go."

Blake: "Rite!"

Freya: "Gerooh!" *She glided away from the cave and flew up into the air, spreading her paws in a proud manner.*

Holland: *He smirked, watching Destiny and Blake closely follow them.* "Haha-" (What a sense of victory.)

Freya: *She looked down, staring at the treetops.* (Our Soul Link.)

Holland: (What about it?)

Freya: (It's got that same quality feeling I've encountered before.)

Holland: "Huh?" *He leant at an angle, looking at Freya's head.*

Freya: (It's the same feeling I used to get when encountering captain levelled warriors.)

Holland: (Captains?)

----------

*Strong winds swirled around the phoenix, causing strings of dirt to whip around the volcano-like terrain.*

Phoenix: "So that is what you desire?"

Sebastian: "Yes!" *He yelled at the top of his lungs, as the scorching wind muffled all sounds.*

Phoenix: "Have instinct take control and you'll know how to obtain the feather you desire."

Sebastian: (How to obtain the feather?) *He stared at the phoenix, watching the air slightly warp in its presence.* (I have no idea what to do, and the only instinctive thing I feel-)

*Sebastian looked down and growled in deep thought, placing a hand on his stomach.*

Sebastian: (Is this strong gut feeling which is absolutely crazy to act upon.)

Phoenix: "Hurry, my patience draws near."

Sebastian: (But my gut feeling-) *He scrunched his eyes shut, mentally preparing himself.*

Phoenix: *It slowly floated up, looking down to Sebastian.* "Do you want to turn back?"

Sebastian: *He started to sprint towards the phoenix, keeping his eyes tightly closed.* (My gut feeling-)

*Sebastian's legs bulked and thickened as they became Scoldrant-like.*

Sebastian: (Is to jump into the phoenix.) *He growled in thought and opened his eyes, jumping like a tornado towards the phoenix.*

*Sebastian whiskers singed as he jumped into the phoenix, causing swirls of fire to spiral around them.*

Phoenix: (The feather is now yours!)

Sebastian: *His clothes singed off his body, revealing his foetus-like position.* (Blake, Holland.. Thank you again for allowing me to complete this pilgrimage!)

----------

*Destiny and Freya flew upwards, easily scaling up an enormous mountain, skilfully avoiding pillars of ruin-like rock.*

Blake: (It's night.. We're in the right area.)

Holland: "We completed the pilgrimage."

Blake: "How so? Like, the sole reason for going there was to better myself, hey."

Freya: "Gruff?" *She barked in confusion as she flapped her wings several times keeping her and Holland in the air.*
Holland: "Besides that selfish comment, in my opinion, you already have."

Blake: "Bitch, please-?"

Holland: "Seriously. Just look at how we first met. I know it was a long time ago, but now, you've become much stronger. You have powerful summons, a stronger Ougi than me, Azure Bursts, the ability to flashstep faster than normal people, you cared for Sebastian and helped me out too."

Blake: *He looked away with blushing cheeks.* (I'm not used to this type of recognition.)

Holland: "And besides, we owe to tell Sebastian's tribe what happened."

Blake: *He slowly nodded his head.* "Watevs."

*Destiny and Freya gently landed at the mountain's peak, causing the air to swirl and open like a portal.*

Holland: (The Spacial Funnel to The Sacred Rostic Tribe-) *He jumped off Freya, watching Blake hop off Destiny.* "We're here."

Blake: *He slowly inhaled and looked at Destiny, nodding his head.* "Thanks for the ride, aye."

Destiny: "Meeheehee." *She sneezed in appreciation and retracted her wings, looking at Holland.* (It's time.)

Holland: (Time for-?)

*Freya and Destiny disintegrated into the air, causing Holland to step forward in shock.*

Holland: (Freya-?!) *He gasped in thought, looking to each side in disbelief.*

Freya: (I'm always here, you know how to call for me. But you need your rest too.) *Her voice echoed in Holland's mind, causing him to relax.*

Blake: "Have you got any idea what to say to these people?"

Holland: "You mean our people?"

Blake: *He chuckled and stepped forward, walking into the portal.* "Yea."

Holland: *He inhaled and braced himself, hesitantly walking through the portal.* (I have no idea what to say.)

*Blake and Holland walked into the village and was greeted by the entire tribe staring at them.*

Blake: *He silently stared at the tribe, listening to the faint sounds of wind howling in the distance.* (This is quiet.)

Holland: "How awkward." *He mumbled and stopped next to Blake.*

Blake: "Fufufu, I know, rite?" *He hissed in agreement, watching Keno and the chief walk out of the crowd.*

*A dark coloured man dressed in green pants, a red short-sleeved shirt with red dyed bones as anklets and bracelets shuffled behind Keno and the chief.*

?????: (Oh my, are these the two that left with Sebastian?) *He scratched behind his ear and reached down, holding onto a tooth tied to a black string around his neck.*

Blake: "Aye, it's the geezer and hairy fox-" *He hissed under his breath and quickly looked away as they stopped in front of him.*

Keno: "Holland-"

Blake: (Here we go.. The usual scolding of failure.)

Holland: *He instantly looked down, slightly frowning with embarrassment.* "I'm sorry, we didn't get the-"

*Keno bowed down in front of Holland and Blake, causing them both to look down in confusion.*

Blake: *He stared at Keno with widening eyes, hissing on his breath.* "W-What are you doing?"

Keno: "Blake and Holland-"

Holland: "Keno, what are you-?"
Blake: "Yea-?"

Keno: "I recognise your powers and potential, and I'm honoured to call you two, family."

Holland: *He stepped back in disbelief, covering his mouth in a feminine manner.* (I'm going bonkers-)
Blake: *He gasped, shaking his head in disbelief.* (This can't be happening. Keno, our leader is bowing down to me?!)

*The tribe members cheered, roared, screeched and yelled in celebration for Blake and Holland.*

?????: *He released his grip on the tooth and clapped several times.* (They completed the pilgrimage.)

Blake: *He stared at the animal-like tribe members in amazement.* "Fufufu, I must be dreaming, hey."

Chief: *He looked into the distance, slightly smiling in sadness.* "I sense Sebastian has reached the end and obtained the feather."

?????: *The chief's words caused him to look into the distance.* (Sebastian..)

Keno: *He stood up, facing Holland with a proud face.* "I'm sorry, I knew it was a dangerous pilgrimage, but I hadn't realised the one I forced you on was-"

Holland: "Don't worry-" *His eyes watered, causing Keno to look confused.*

Keno: "Don't worry? Did I not explain myself properly-?"

Holland: "I have her again." *He smiled with emotion, touching his chest.*

Keno: (Oh, Holland..) *He hobbled closer and slapped Holland on the cheek.*

Holland: "H-Hey-?"

Keno: "A Scoldrant User can't be alive if his Scoldrant has passed away."

Holland: "My bad." *He smirked, causing him to sigh with realisation and understanding.*

Blake: *He looked past Keno and observed the cheers of the tribal members, causing him to smirk in confusion.* (They couldn't wait to get rid of me.. Now that I did somefing for them, their attitude conveniently changes-)

Chief: "Blake."

Blake: "H-Huh, yea?" *He was distracted by the celebrating tribe members.*

Chief: *He took a large step up to Blake, touching his shoulder.* "The environment spoke to me about you-"

Blake: "Aye?! Wat did the bitch say?" *He hissed in a betrayed-like manner, stamping the dirt in disgust.*

Chief: "Despite no Soul Links, we're always connected."

Blake: "And? I already know this. How else do we connect to the environment-?"

Chief: "You don't need to have Soul Links to be connected to something." *He purposely ignored Blake and spoke with a simplified tone in his voice as if he was trying to imply something.*

Blake: "..."

Chief: (He doesn't understand.) *He thought to himself with a growing smile, revealing his canine teeth.* (Bhavik?) *He glanced at the tanned man behind him.*

Bhavik: *The chief's thoughts caused him to step forward.* (Memories, reveal to him.)

*The ground around Blake's feet suddenly glowed green and lines shot through the planet, taking his vision with it.*

Blake: (What's going on?!)

*The lines suddenly shot out of the ground and revealed glowing red dragon eyes.*

Bhavik: "Hymm?" *He tilted his head to one side as if he was intrigued by the information he received.* (So that's where his Soul Linked partner is.)

Blake: *He suddenly gasped with realisation, covering his mouth with both hands.* "Is that really-?" *He spoke through his hands, fixating all his attention to the chief.*

Chief: *He nodded his head in response as if he knew what Blake was going to ask.* (Thank you, Bhavik, for showing him the way.)

Bhavik: (A little cruel to hide that fact after completing the pilgrimage, riight?)

Chief: (He had to prove to himself, or his history will merely repeat itself.)

Bhavik: (Hehehmm, I was just being facetious.)

Blake: (That was it? My partner that rejected me all those years ago?)

Chief: "We're celebrating Sebastian's-, no, the party's accomplishment."

Blake: (I don't believe it... I went out to all four corners of the land, and the answer was right under my nose..)

Chief: "Despite the celebrations, I have a gut feeling you two still need things to do, so feel free to leave or stay whenever." *He turned around and started to walk towards the fire, watching tribe members dance in circles around it.*

Blake: "Where are you going?" *He hissed at the chief in confusion, staring at his fur covered back.*

Chief: "It's not common to see such happiness and commotion happen in the village like this, I desire to be part of it."

Blake: ".. OK." *He looked down with a slight smile and leant to one side, placing a hand on his waist.*

Chief: (There'll be a few more bad times to come, but nature sees a bright future ahead of us.) *His body became a silhouette as he danced with a member next to the fire.*

Keno: *He smiled, as he admired and respected Holland as an equal.* "Go."

Holland: "What?"

Keno: "You've gained one of your loves, Freya." *He looked over to Blake, sighing with a widening smile.* "And you look like you're about to cry."

Blake: *He breathed through his mouth and bit his lips, trying to hide his emotions.* "He showed me-"

Keno: "Perhaps you two should leave before losing some of that hero-like stigma." *He chuckled in a teasing manner.*

Blake: *He sniffed and looked at Holland, noticing he had the same facial expression.* "I'm gonna go."

Keno: "Oh, and Blake?"

Blake: "Y-Yea?"

Keno: "You're welcome back to the village anytime, including you too, Holland."

Blake: *He gasped, slowly turning around in thought.* (I'm welcome back to the village?)

Keno: "Blake?"

Blake: *He discreetly smiled and shook his head, slowly walking away.* "I-I don't care."

Holland: (Freya, our quest is finally over.. But, I won't go back to the village until I help my friends defeat the Consultant-)

Freya: (I can feel what you feel.. I know.) *Her echoing growls sounded as if she was tired yet happy.*

Keno: "Will I see you back at our village?"

Holland: "I'm going to go, too." *He spoke as if he didn't want to leave, but had to.*

Keno: *He nodded his head in understanding.* "I'll see you shortly."

Holland: "Shortly? What do you mean? How do you know-?"

Keno: "Just a gut feeling." *He smiled and turned around, watching the members perform a tribe-like dance around the fire.*

Holland: *He took a deep breath and turned around, quickly jogging up to Blake.* "Blake was it?"

Blake: "Yea?" *He stopped, facing Holland in confusion.*

Holland: "We never had a proper introduction, my name's Holland."

Blake: *He looked at Holland as if he was an idiot.* "You already know my name?"

Holland: "Well, you're not a bad guy, so friends?" *He spoke in respect, presenting his hand.*

Blake: *He stared at Holland's hand in shock.* "Umm-"

Holland: "No?"

Blake: "Yea." *He smirked, grabbing Holland's hand.* "You're a top guy yourself, aye."

Holland: "I dunno about you, but I wasn't expecting a response like that." *He nudged his head over his shoulder, focusing Blake's attention on to the tribe members.*

Blake: *He chuckled, nodding his head in agreement.* "I wasn't expecting that from Keno either, respecting us as equals to him." *He sighed, looking at Holland with emotion.*

Holland: "Yeah."

Blake: *He paused and looked away, as if he didn't want to be there.* "I've been shown the way, so see ya." *He stepped back, flashstepping out of the village.*

Holland: "See you later.." *He smiled, watching swirls of grass and dirt spiral where Blake stood.*

*The sounds of cheers echoed from the fire, due to the celebrating tribe members.*

Holland: (Meeting Keno, encountering the legendary bird, learning a Hi-Ougi, having Freya back..)

*Holland sniffed and wiped his eyes with his shoulders in a manly fashion.*

Holland: (PKMY, I need to talk to you.) *He mumbled in determination, silently walking into the portal out of the village.*

-

Bhavik: (Are you sure?)

Chief: *His eyes reflected the fire's light as it danced around it.* (He is about to confront his partner. Holland has satisfied what he's desired, but Blake has a few more struggles to deal with.)

Bhavik: (Sounds like it'll be a little enervating.) *He sighed in thought and played with the tooth around his necklace.* (But we owe him a great deal of reverence for his actions, riight?)

Chief: (You are the second strongest in this tribe.) *His tone implied he wanted Bhavik to leave.*

Bhavik: (Good grief. Hehehmm.) *He smiled and nodded his head, casually walking out of the village.*

Chapter 3: Teresa's Tale

*A purple glyph flashed in a secluded, ancient appearing ruins surrounded by a tropical forest, causing a flock of bird-like Scoldrants to flap away.*

Teresa: "...-" *She glanced at the ancient pillars, staring at thick vines which spiralled down them and into the ground.*

*Teresa stared into space with an emotionless face and suddenly collapsed face-first off the fading glyph.*

Teresa: "T-Tcch-"

*The metallic sound of her armour hitting the ground echoed, causing the wildlife to become quiet.*

Teresa: *She panted, lying motionless on the solid ground.* "Mother-"

*Teresa rolled onto her back, ignoring the pain caused by The Grand Seal.*

Teresa: "Why...?" *She raised her arm and reached towards the sky, whispering to herself.* "Why would you show yourself only to say goodbye? How... Selfish."

*Teresa rolled to her side and swayed her arms in an exhausted manner, sitting on her knees.*

Teresa: "An overwhelming fight..." *She whispered under her breath, ignoring a damp mark she left on the ground.*

*The wildlife started to make noises again, as Teresa slowly stood on her feet.*

Teresa: *She took a deep breath and stood up straight, flicking feral-like hair over her shoulder.* (The constant headache this seal is causing is very-)

*Teresa stepped forward, squishing weeds under her metallic boots.*

Teresa: (-Troublesome.)

*Teresa looked up and noticed the large set of stone stairs, which towered up above the treetops.*

Teresa: (I have precisely enough stamina and Neurons remaining to flash-) *Her image appeared above the stairs and she fell backwards onto her back.* (-Step-)

*Teresa coughed and struggled, as she attempted to stand back up.*

Teresa: "Why can I not-?"

*Another flock of bird-like Scoldrants flapped off a nearby tree, flying into the sky.*

Teresa: *She stopped and took another deep breath, trying to relax.* "If I were to see myself now, I would say, what a prime example of such tedious, pathetic-like behaviour-"

*Teresa revert back into an emotionless doll and regained her posture, standing back onto her feet.*

*Monkey-like Scoldrants jumped off vines and branches, jumping across the path.*

Teresa: *She watched the monkeys jump into the forest, screeching out of her eyesight.* (Being here again-)

*Teresa looked down the stone path which was surrounded by trees, noticing it led to the old ruins.*

Teresa: (Although it was not long ago, I hardly remember those old hieroglyphs that are engraved on the stone walls.)

*Teresa reached underneath her belt, pulling out a small crystal.*

Teresa: "Those who see with their own eyes and feel with their own hearts, can not be fooled by words alone."

*The hieroglyphs glowed in response and filled with colour, causing the Spacial Funnel to open up.*

Teresa: "The Lost City."

*Teresa staggered towards the Spacial Funnel and stopped in front of it, looking at her hands in thought.*

Teresa: (Despite my physical appearance, I will not allow people to see myself in such a weakened condition.) *She looked determined and proudly entered the Spacial Funnel.*

*Villagers in robes walked across the maze-like paths of stone, unaware of Teresa's sudden entry.*

Teresa: "..." *She watched people pray around a large statue, noticing a small rainbow shine in the sprinkles of water caused by the water fountain.*

Teresa: (I sense that Joy and Chrisma are still absent from this city.) "Tcch."

*Teresa stared at the statue of the woman with wings, before looking towards Joy's house in the distance.*

Teresa: (I predicted she would have returned already.)

*A woman holding a basket of flowers and a watering device walked past Teresa, entering the city.*

Woman: *She gasped and froze on the spot, noticing Teresa's armour and warrior-like appearance.* "O-Oh a w-warrior?"

Teresa: "I pose no threat, continue with your daily routine." *She walked down the path, ignoring the woman's response.*

Woman: *She stared at Teresa's back in fear, accidentally dropping the basket of flowers.* (A warrior?!)

Teresa: (Perhaps I should have take the appropriate effort to care for my appearance, it would serve an inconvenience if people were distracted by something trivial such as my condition.)

Woman: (How did the warrior get in? Please leave us be!) *She prayed to herself and awkwardly picked up the flowers, keeping a fixated stare on Teresa.*

*Teresa's image disappeared, causing the woman to jump in fright, dropping the watering device.*

Teresa: *She appeared in front of Joy's house and touched the door, causing a spiralling glyph to appear.* (The rate of bad events which occur in the city is almost nil-)

*The glyph made an unlocking sound, cueing Teresa to gracefully walk into the house.*

Teresa: (Yet she seals her house to this extent?)

*Sounds of child-like laughter and footsteps could be heard outside, causing Teresa to look over her shoulder in annoyance.*

Teresa: *She shook her head and focused her attention back in front, walking up the stairs.* (Tcch, children..)

*Teresa stood at Joy's room and opened the curtain, letting herself in.*

Teresa: "Hoh?" *She instantly noticed the Crystalline Membrane which held her memories.* (I.. I should watch it-)

*Teresa hesitantly looked away and unclipped parts of her armour, allowing her to take them off.*

Teresa: (After changing into my warrior garments-) *She started to take off her clothes, revealing her bare, smooth skin.* (My appearance has suddenly caused me such annoyance.)

*Teresa clipped her metallic boots off and walked into a small room, containing a small tiled, cube-like shower.*

Teresa: (It is rather trivial that others would waste such vital energy worrying about other's appearance.)

*Teresa stepped inside the cube-like shower, noticing thick, black glyphs painted on the tiled walls, each with different designs.*

--

*More villagers gathered around the statue outside, as they chattered amongst themselves.*

--

Teresa: (How will I remove The Grand Seal without Joy's, or even Chrisma's assistance-?) "Tcch."

*Teresa grunted at herself in slight frustration, as water swirled out of glyphs and around her.*

Teresa: *She placed her hand on the wall, looking down to her feet.* (What has caused me to choose this action? An action I swore to never see through.)

*Dirt and dried blood cleansed out of her hair and drained with the water, which swirled into the glyphs.*

--

*Terra, Joy and a child form of Chrisma sat on their knees in Joy's room.*

Terra: *She adjusted the pillow under her legs and took a deep breath in preparation, nodding her head at Joy.* "I am ready."

Joy: (I would ask if she's sure about this, but she's risking being executed by the Consultants for even being here.)

Chrisma: *She drew different elemental glyphs on a piece of paper with crayons.* "This glyph is water." *She smiled to herself oblivious to what Joy and Terra were doing.*

Joy: *She shuffled across the floor and kneeled face to face with Terra.* "My preparations are complete." *She nodded her head, spreading her hands in front of her face.*

Terra: "Will.. This hurt?"

Joy: "Perhaps."

Terra: *She calmly spoke with an emotionless face, staring at Joy's palms.* "I see."

Joy: (The death of Tarlea has affected us all. But the one who appears to have suffered the most, is Terra.) *She clapped her hands and spread them in an articulate manner, causing small glyphs to spiral in the air.*

Terra: *She watched a small glyph rotate in front of her head, observing its glyphic markings in detail.* (Despite being a small glyph, the level of detail inscribed in its formula is something above Grand Rostical.)

Joy: (I need to be precise-) *She pushed forward, causing layers of glyphs to expand towards Terra's head.* (If I mess up just one Astragon portion, it could cause permanent damage to her Rostical usage.)

*Joy pushed forward, causing the glyphs to spiral faster.*

Joy: (Now!) *She frowned in deep concentration, shooting a black beam through each glyph.*

Terra: *The beam hit her forehead and made sizzling sounds.* (I am not sure if this is the right thing to do, but, I want this..)

Chrisma: *The beam caught her attention, causing her to lower the crayons.* (Aunty Joy is drawing on Terra's head?)

Joy: *She squinted her eyes and twirled her fingers, adjusting the glyph's rotation.* (Things are going perfect at the moment.)

Terra: *The black beam moved with the rotating glyphs forming an engraved glyph on her forehead.* (With this, I don't... Don't...-) *Her eye twitched as she purposely withheld the signs of pain.* (With this, I do not fear emotional damage, and can merely focus on physical injuries. That is an intelligent and logical ideal for a warrior.)

Chrisma: *She stared at the tattoo markings on Terra's forehead, awing in a child-like manner.* (Wow, it's a glyph?!)

Joy: *She gasped in relief and slouched forward, lowering her arms.* "It is done."

Terra: *She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, slowly exhaling in accomplishment.* "I see." *She leant back, causing her armour to rattle.*

Chrisma: *She stood up with concern, awkwardly tugging her robes.* "H-How does it feel, Terra-?"

Terra: "Children will speak when spoken to." *Her cold sounding words caused Chrisma to step away intimidated.*

Joy: "Terra?"

Terra: *She opened her eyes and stood up in a proud manner, slowly turning around.* "Everything appears to have gone according to plan, it is dire I return before the Consultants know of my disappearance."

Joy: (Did I do the right thing..?) *She stood up in silence, watching Terra leave her room.*

Terra: *She had a flashback of a large midnight coloured rose.* (Teresa's Blossom...)

Joy: "Terra?"

Terra: "Hmph, Terra?" *She started to walk down the stairs, whispering in thought.*

Joy: *She stepped out of her room, staring at Terra's back in a worried manner.* "Terra?!"

Terra: "People will now refer to me as Teresa-" *She spoke in a monotone and suddenly flashstepped out of sight.*

Joy: *She looked down and sighed in a guilty manner.* (Teresa...?)

-

Terra: *She suddenly appeared at the entrance of The Lost City, looking at her hands in thought.* (I feel... As I should... I do not feel..)

*Terra slightly frowned in determination, flashstepping out of the city.*

--

*Teresa adjusted sleeves around her wrists, as she walked into the room with damp hair.*

Teresa: *She closed her eyes, placing her hands behind her neck under her hair.* (People change, that is understandable, yet, one would not think of themselves to be the one that has changed.) *She referred to herself, as she flicked her hair out of Joy's green robes.*

*Teresa opened her eyes and looked at her armour and garments, which was neatly folded and stacked in a pile on the floor.*

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She rubbed her forehead in pain.* "I do remember, although hazily, The Grand Seal weakened to an extent of self-removal-"

*Teresa stopped in mid-sentence, as the seal caused her more pain.*

Teresa: "Despite this, it has not broken on its own accord."

*Teresa mumbled to herself, focusing her attention on the Crystalline Membrane.*

Teresa: *She deeply inhaled, bracing herself for something she didn't want to do.* "One is as strong as one's weakness. This weakness of mine is revolting." *She held her chest, causing the robes to scrunch and wrinkle.*

*Teresa took several steps towards the Crystalline Membrane and slowly bent down, hesitantly picking it up.*

Teresa: *She sat down on her knees and closed her eyes, cupping her hands around the crystal.* (From where I left off.)

--

*Suns, Jewel, Eliza, Tyre and Teresa leant forward in exhaustion.*

Tarlea: *She flicked her hair and stared at the party who formed a line in front of her.* "Very good."

Eliza: (Very good? My Rostical stood no chance against her power.)

Jewel: (She saw through all my illusions.) *She heavily breathed through her mouth.*

Teresa: (Mother is amazing, she never witnessed my flashstepping ability before, and she saw right through it in a moment's use.) *She held her shoulder with discomfort, smiling to herself in respect.*

Suns: "I mixed fire and ground to create swirls of lava. I even mixed water and lightning to create static volts, nothing worked against you."

Tyre: "Dude, she blocked my boulder-smashing punches with one hand." *He grunted in an arrogant manner, causing Suns to nod his head.*

Jewel: "So, what did we do well at then?" *She spoke with a high and timid voice, looking at Tarlea for feedback.*

Eliza: *She nodded her head, intensely staring at Tarlea.* (Tarlea isn't even sweating.)

Tarlea: "The utilisation of each party member's greatest attributes."

Eliza: "Huh?"

Tarlea: "For example, Suns covered Tyre's long-range weakness."

Tyre: "Pftt." *He rolled his eyes, discreetly smirking in a flattered manner.*

Suns: *He smiled and nodded his head, wrapping his arm around Tyre.* "Yeah."

Tarlea: "Jewel, although your illusions were of no threat, the distraction they caused served Terra's and Eliza's powers respectively."

Jewel: "Heetee-"

*Four large explosions of dirt erupted behind the party, instantly catching their attention.*

Jewel: "The ground rumbled?" *She sounded surprised, looking down in confusion.*

Suns: "Huh?" *He glanced over his shoulder, turning around in a curious manner.*
Tyre: "Eh?" *He stepped away from Suns, looking towards the explosions.*

Eliza: "What is it?" *She looked at Teresa, waiting for an explanation.*

Teresa: *She closed her eyes, whispering in concentration.* "Sensing now-"

Tarlea: (What could it be?) *She looked at the dirt cloud and squinted her eyes as if she tried to see through it.*

Teresa: *She shook her head, exhaling in confusion.* "N-Nothing?"

Jewel: *She held her breath and closed her eyes, causing the air to warp around her head.* (I sense-) *She gasped, looking at the dirt cloud in an alerted-like manner.* "It's three Ancioldrants."

Eliza: "Why would they bother showing themselves? Our combined power would be a repellent to any Scoldrants, even Ancioldrants."

Tarlea: (Eliza's right, something doesn't make sense.) *She stood in a cautious battle-ready pose, staring at the dirt cloud.*

Tyre: "Ancioldrants? Is that it?" *He sounded disappointed as if there was no longer a threat.*

Tarlea: (And if something doesn't make sense, then something isn't right-)

Tyre: "That's nothing for us-"

*Three large, violent dragon-looking Ancioldrants stamped out of their dirt clouds, staring at the party with killing intent.*

Tarlea: *Her eyes widened, as she leant to one side in shock.* (Those Neuron signatures!)

Suns: "What a crazy entrance for Ancioldrants, though."

Tarlea: (I've never felt an Ancioldrant of this power before.) *She thought to herself in a worried manner, watching the massive dirt cloud swirl around their legs.*

Tyre: "I reckon we can take 'em." *He grinned and formed fists, punching them together.*

Eliza: "I agree." *She skipped in front of the party and a green glyph shined under her feet.* "With the power of the northern winds-"

Tarlea: *She shook her head, keeping her fixated, worried-like stare on them.* (Those Ancioldrants have the power equivalent to number one!)

Teresa: *She continued to observe the slow-appearing Ancioldrants, suddenly gasping in thought.* (No! They're stronger.)

*Tarlea looked worried at the party with a sense of responsibility, knowing she was stronger than them.*

Ancioldrant A: "Prepare to be punished-"

Ancioldrant B: *Its scales were slightly darker in tint compared to the other two.* "FLAME BOLT-" *It breathed out a fluoro red ball, suddenly shooting it at flashstepping speeds.*

Tyre: "This will be nothing-" *He spread his arms without worry and an explosion violently burnt across his face, blasting him far back into the distance.*

Eliza: "Tyre!" *She screamed at the top of her lungs, looking back in shock.*

Jewel: *A trail of smoke drew her attention downwards, causing her to gasp in disbelief.* "I-Imp-Impossible!"

*Jewel stepped back in terror, intensely staring at Tyre's arm on the ground.*

Teresa: *She inhaled with shock and disbelief, as her hair flicked back due to the force of the Ancioldrant's Rostical.* (A low levelled Rostical did that!-)

Tarlea: *She gritted her teeth, slowly reached over her shoulder.* "Suns, prepare a teleportation glyph!"

Suns: "Tyre... His Neurons have f-faded-"

Tarlea: "Suns!" *She shouted in a stern manner, watching sparks scatter around her arm and sabre.*

Suns: "Got it!"

Eliza: *She looked at the Ancioldrant, frowning with watering eyes.* "I'm going to-" *Vine-like scales shot up from the ground, piercing holes throughout her body.*

Teresa: "Eliza!" *She screamed and flashstepped to the side, avoiding a vine-like scale.*

Eliza: "Karh-" *She gasped one last time before falling to the ground.*

Teresa: "No!" *She looked sad, watching Eliza's body disintegrate into tiny white orbs.*

Suns: (Impossible!) *He stood in a defensive stance, as he mentally prepared for the teleportation glyph.*

Tarlea: "Two number ones-" *She sounded irritated and firmly held her sabre, as her image disappeared.*

Ancioldrant A: "FLAMING STORM-"

Tarlea: *She appeared above the Ancioldrant, watching fire ignite on the ground and ring towards the captains.* "Harh!" *She dived and sliced downwards, landing on the ground with ease.*

Ancioldrant A: "?!" *It awkwardly stopped, causing the fire to extinguish into the air.*

Tarlea: *She watched the Ancioldrant's head slice off and fall to the ground, causing her to smirk.* "..."

Teresa: (The fire-?) *She focused her attention in the distance, noticing Tarlea gracefully swaying her sabre in a victorious manner.* (She's fast.)

Suns: "Where did Tarlea go-?" *He noticed Teresa's fixated stare, causing him to look into the distance at Tarlea.* (Oh-)

Tarlea: *She looked towards the closest Ancioldrant and crossed her arms, watching four flower-like glyphs rotate in front of her.* "Magnanimity Decibel."

Ancioldrant B: *It glanced at Tarlea, opening its massive jaw.* "You will die-"

Tarlea: "Hermph-" *She pushed forward, blasting a barrage of blue rose petals towards the Ancioldrant.*

Ancioldrant B: "K-Ker-argh-" *It moaned in pain as the petals sliced past it.*

Ancioldrant C: *It watched Tarlea from a safe distance and it suddenly glanced to the party.* (Destroy my two comrades? I will finish off the task given to me.)

Tarlea: (Those Neurons?!) *She quickly spun around, facing the last Ancioldrant in shock.*

Ancioldrant C: "Sonic Roar." *It lunged forward with a dropping jaw, roaring out a sonic shockwave towards the party.*

Tarlea: *She glanced at the sonic shockwave, stepping forward in desperation.* (Too late!)

Suns: "Alright! I've prepared the correct amount of Neurons and Astragons, I will commence the tele-" *His body suddenly exploded followed by the sonic shockwave.*

Teresa: *She gasped and raised her arms in shock, as flesh rained down around her.* "S-SS-S-Suns?!" *She screamed in horror, quickly flicking a piece of flesh off her shoulder.*

Tarlea: *She looked at the Ancioldrant with a serious face.* "Foul creature, what brings you here?!"

Ancioldrant C: (My Sonic Roar only killed one of them?) *It focused its attention on its comrade watching its body slice to pieces caused by Tarlea's Azure.* "You-"

Tarlea: *She pointed the sabre to her feet, feeling the Ancioldrant's body rumble the ground with a serious smirk.* "Answer me!"

Ancioldrant C: (She's powerful!) *It groaned with shock and focused its attention back to the party.* "There are two left!"

Tarlea: *She looked back to Teresa and Jewel.* "Why are you focusing on them?! You witnessed the power I wield, I can do the same to you!"

Ancioldrant: "HOWLING GALES" *It ignored Tarlea and groaned the Rostical, as it stared at Teresa and Jewel with widening eyes.*

Tarlea: "Tcch-"

Jewel: *She took awkward, overwhelmed breaths of fear, as a sudden swirl of wind sliced the grass around them.* "T-Teresa!" *She squinted her eyes, frozen with terror.*

Teresa: "Blast!" *Her hair and cape rapidly flapped in the wind.*

*Chunks of ground burst open around Jewel and Teresa, causing them to slide back due to the force of the wind.*

Tarlea: "Humph." *She appeared in the air above the Ancioldrant, swaying the sword to her side.*

Ancioldrant C: "Grahf?" *It looked up surprised.*

Tarlea: "Icicle Stroke." *She frowned and enthusiastically slashed the air, slicing a line of blue ice down the Ancioldrant's face.* "Tcch-"

Ancioldrant: "That hurt!-" *It leant back and scrunched its eyes shut, violently reacting to the ice.*

Tarlea: *She flashstepped next to Teresa, causing a swirl of dirt to blow behind her.* "Terra, I will activate the teleportation glyph myself, see how the others are going."

Teresa: *She stood in shock, as a continuous flashback of Suns exploding replayed in her head.* "..."

Jewel: *She squealed, as she slid back due to the powerful winds.* "We're trapped in this wind, we can't do anything!"

Tarlea: "Tcch-" (She's right-) *She gripped her hands around the sabre, closely observing the swirling wind's current.*

Jewel: *She glanced over to Tarlea, causing her hair to cover the side of her face.* "Tarlea?" *The winds blocked out her voice, causing Tarlea to unintentionally ignore her.*

Tarlea: "Air Slash." *She sliced the air and a visible air slash hit the wall of wind.* (Due to the number one training, even I'm slightly worn out-)

*The wind's strength drastically dwindled, causing Jewel to lower her arms in disbelief.*

Jewel: (Amazing-) *She watched the wind's current alter and break, causing the howling to stop.*

Teresa: *She continued to stand on the spot frozen in fear.* "..."

Tarlea: (That Ancioldrant's Remenistal was powerful.) *She inhaled, as another explosion erupted from the ground in front.*

Jewel: "W-What was that?"

Tarlea: "The Rasticsplash caused by both our wind-based attacks."

Jewel: *She nodded her head and looked over to Teresa, noticing her fear-like body posture.* "Tarlea, I will check-"

*A scaly tentacle shot out from the dirt cloud, wrapping itself around Jewel's waist.*

Jewel: "Arh!"

Teresa: "J-Jewel." *She gasped under her breath, shaking her head, unsure what to do.*

Tarlea: "Tcch-" *She observed the scaly tentacle, frowning in thought.* (This Ancioldrant used the dirt cloud caused by our Rasticplash as an opportunity to attack! Its actions seem unnatural-)

Ancioldrant C: *It roared, shattering the ice off its face.* "How dare you!"

Tarlea: "Power of the forbidden spirits, come to my command, with seraphic powers-"

Ancioldrant C: *Its eyes shined yellow and it stood straight on all fours, watching Jewel fling into the air.* "Three remaining, allow me to make that two." *It groaned and dug its tail further into the ground, tightening its grip around Jewel.*

Jewel: "L-Let me go!" *She listening to leather-like noises, as the vines crushed her muscles.*

Tarlea: "TELEPORTATION" *She shouted, watching a purple glyph flash on the ground.* "Terra-" *She quickly looked to her side at Teresa, shouting in an urgent manner.* "The glyph is-"

Teresa: "Jewel!" *She reached behind her back and sparks scattered, as she twirled the Pentarang in her hand.*

Tarlea: "Terra! The Ancioldrant is far too powerful in your condition!" *She had images of slashing Teresa across the body.* "The training is too exhausting-"

Teresa: *She sprinted towards the Ancioldrant, crossing her arms with emotion.* "Magnanimity-"

Ancioldrant C: *It opened its jaw and multi-coloured flames poured out from its mouth.* "Bakana Flare."

Tarlea: *She glanced over to the Ancioldrant, staring at Teresa with widening eyes.* "Terra, don't! It used a powerful-" *She yelled in front and couldn't move, as if she was restricted to the teleportation glyph.*

Ancioldrant C: *It puffed, causing a wave of multi-coloured flames to blast in front of it.* (Besides the woman who took out my two comrades, the other two cannot withstand my flames.)

Teresa: "Tcch! Ougi." *She gritted her teeth and quickly swayed her arms, as the area lit up around her.*

Jewel: *Her jaw dropped, as she watched the flames intensify towards her from the Ancioldrant's mouth.* (It's going to burn me!)

Teresa: (Suns! Tyre!-)

Jewel: "Teresa, leave! I can sense an active teleportation-" *She screamed with desperation, implying for Teresa to leave on the glyph.*

Teresa: "Bakana Flare!" *She cupped her free hand and raised it to her face as she continued to charge towards the Ancioldrant.*

Tarlea: (Terra is full of emotion, we can get out of here now if she leaves with me on the glyph.)

Teresa: "Harh-" *She pushed forward and a multi-coloured, volcanic-like eruption blasted in front.*

Ancioldrant C: "Karh!" *It roared, increasing the flare's speed of multi-coloured flames towards Teresa.*

Tarlea: (It just applied Neuron pressure in the attack!-) *She watched an explosion of flames swirl in strings, as the two flares collided into each other.*

Jewel: "No!-" *She covered her face, as burning flames scorched her arms.* "It-It hurts!" *She squinted her eyes, watching flames splinter past her.*

Teresa: *Her hair pulsed back, as she pushed both arms at the flares, attempting to push her flames forward.* "Argh, it's too strong-" *She screamed and flipped backwards due to the force of the flames.*

Ancioldrant C: *It watched the fire extinguish leaving steam, smog and differently coloured fire patches on the ground.* (Although my attack was stronger and pushed the woman back-)

Teresa: *She panted on the spot, grunting at herself in an annoyed manner.* (We used the same technique, but mine was weaker!)

Ancioldrant C: (-It was not enough to scorch either of my targets.) *It glared at Jewel and its eerie yellow eyes shined, causing its scaly, vine-like tail to tighten.*

Tarlea: (It's going to kill Jewel! The window of opportunity to leave with Teresa unharmed has left!) "Blast." *She tightened her hands, dropping her sabre.*

Jewel: "Eeek-" *She exhaled and a loud snap cracked, causing her body to instantly flop in a lifeless manner.*

Ancioldrant C: "Two left." *It showed its sharp teeth, giving the illusion it smiled.*

Tarlea: *She flashstepped in front of Teresa and stood proudly, intensely staring at the Ancioldrant.* "I used this once in Valhalla-" (The technique which inspired this foolish nickname of yours.)

Teresa: *Her vision blurred and Tarlea's voice mumbled.* (All my senses have been impaired, am I that drained?)

Tarlea: "Ougi."

Teresa: (Jewel, Suns, Eliza, Tyre... No.) *She breathed heavily and looked up to Tarlea, coughing in exhaustion.*

Ancioldrant C: "What, Valhalla? Have you been there?" *It chuckled in a scary, croaky voice, as if it didn't believe her.*

Tarlea: "Teresa's Blossom." *The area became pitch black and orbs of visible Neurons started to float in front of her.*

Ancioldrant C: *It groaned in shock, intensely staring at the orbs of light.* "I was forewarned about you."

Tarlea: *The orbs whirled and sprinkled into the ground.* (Forewarned?)

Teresa: *Her body lifted off the ground as if there was no gravity.* "H-Huh?"

Tarlea: "Don't worry, my Ougi distorts the Astragons by bending the space-" *She tapped her toe and slightly floated up.* "Gravity hasn't been affected but the space has."

*A human-sized flower bud grew up from the ground, catching Teresa's attention.*

Teresa: *She loudly gasped, covering her mouth in shock and anticipation.* "I-Is this really your Ougi?" (I can count on one hand the number of times I've seen it.)

Tarlea: "This powerful Ougi is named after the previous Valkyrie."

Ancioldrant C: *Its eyes widened.* "I am the strongest out of the three sent to kill you-"

Tarlea: *The flower blossomed into a massive white rose with teal shadowing around the petals.* "I try not to use this as it's a guaranteed death."

Ancioldrant C: "Then why didn't you use it in the first place?" *It spoke hiding its fear.*

Tarlea: "I don't believe I'm in any position to take lives-"

*White glitter shined around the rose, causing twinkle-like sounds to swirl in the air.*

Tarlea: "Have mercy on your spirit." *She twirled around and faced Teresa as if the fight was over.*

Teresa: *She struggled to touch the ground, scraping her toes on the grass.* (What is that flower? I don't remember seeing it before. It's beautiful.)

*Petals of the rose drifted off the bud and floated in the air, catching the Ancioldrant's attention.*

Tarlea: "It's similar to our Azure." *She carelessly pushed back and the petals sliced through the air.*

Ancioldrant C: *It noticed the petals and prepared to react accordingly.* "Harh?" *It tilted its head back, noticing the petals waft behind it.*

Teresa: (My eyes couldn't track the flower's movements!-) *She dropped to the ground and squinted her eyes, as the area reverted back to normal.*

Ancioldrant C: *It bent to one side, as its legs sliced off its body.* "Haha."

Tarlea: "Why laugh? Your body has been sliced over four-hundred times in critical areas-"

Teresa: (Mother..-?)

Tarlea: "The cuts were so clean your body has yet to react to the damages." *She spoke with an emotionless face and looked at Teresa, taking a deep breath.*

Ancioldrant C: *It glared at Teresa, knowing it was about to die.* "The death of your friend and mother could have been avoided if you chose to overcome your fear and stepped onto the glyph." *It chuckled, as its body collapsed into a forming dirt cloud.*

Tarlea: *She sighed and tripped on her feet, causing her to awkwardly place one leg forward.* (After that excessive training and by using my strongest Ougi, I'm very weak-)

Teresa: *She froze in fear, watching the dirt cloud expand around the Ancioldrant.* (Its body sliced in slabs like food!)

Tarlea: (What that Ancioldrant said, it was talking to my Terra?) "Are you injured?"

Teresa: "N-No." *She shuffled her feet towards Tarlea, losing her professional-like composure.*

Tarlea: "The teleportation glyph will not stay active that much longer, so-"

*A dark spear suddenly and violently shot up from the ground piercing Tarlea in the chest.*

Tarlea: "Kah-?" *She looked down in shock, intensely staring at shadow-like smog which enveloped the spear.* (My heart?)

Teresa: "M-Mother?!" *She shook her head and leapt forward, grabbing Tarlea with a hug-like motion.*

Tarlea: *She grabbed the spear and twisted her wrist, causing the spear to disintegrate into tiny black orbs.* "Go!"

Teresa: "N-No-"

Tarlea: *Her eyes shined gold and she kissed Teresa on the forehead.* "There."

Teresa: "There?" *She whimpered, avoiding eye contact.*

Tarlea: *She ignored Teresa, stroking her hair in a motherly manner.* "Terra, use it wisely as I did."

Teresa: *She shook her head in confusion, attempting to pull Tarlea back towards the glyph.* "L-Let's go?"

Tarlea: (I feel his presence, I knew it-) *Her findings caused her to push Teresa back.*

Teresa: "W-What-?"

Tarlea: "Go, now."

Teresa: "I-I don't know-" *She shook her head, as tears ran down her cheeks.* "I'm not leaving you!-"

Tarlea: "I'm sorry-" *She pointed at Teresa, glaring at her with an emotionless face.*

Teresa: "J-Just tell me what's-"

Tarlea: "Typhoon's Pulse." *She nudged her finger and a blast of wind pushed Teresa into the air.*

Teresa: "Why-?!" *She tumbled across the ground towards the purple light, causing the glyph to instantly flash in response.*

Tarlea: *She watched Teresa disappear with the fading glyph, causing her to look down to her chest in accomplishment.* (It's the least I could do for you...)

--

Teresa: *She dropped the Crystalline Membrane, looking around Joy's room in confusion.* (From that moment, I earned the title of number one. Swore oath on my mother's behalf to the Consultants, and created The Grand Seal.) *She thought to herself as if she needed reminding and paused, as tears ran down her emotionless face.*

*Drum beats and orchestra-like singing could be heard outside, causing Teresa to unintentionally frown.*

Teresa: (Nevertheless, Joy not being here caused this visit to be an entirely waste of precious time and resource.)

*Teresa stood up and suddenly smashed the Crystalline Membrane with her foot, facing the curtain to leave the room.*

Teresa: (I suppose I came for sanctuary. I have restored most of my stamina, despite my wounds already being healed-)

*Teresa felt the floor rumble, drawing her attention to the sounds of men and women singing outside.*

Teresa: "Tcch-"

*Teresa frowned in thought, listening to loud musical scores outside.*

Teresa: (The Purafetic Ceremony, what a pointless and insignificant ritual, it is unfathomable that people waste such energy on a thing.)

*Teresa thought to herself in disgust and flicked the curtain open, gracefully walking down the stairs.*

Teresa: "Humph." *She stepped outside and stopped, looking around in shock.*

*Moonlight shined on the city, causing the stone pathways and houses to glow a holy blue.*

Teresa: (Night-?) "Sunset has passed already?"

*The drums and musical talent stopped, drawing Teresa's attention towards several villagers.*

Teresa: *She stepped forward and walked along the path, observed the passing villagers' faces.* (Their exhausted faces, how pointless.) *She unintentionally thought in a condescending manner, walking past the statue towards the exit of the city.*

Man: "You know, I never thought it would've been that awesome." *He spoke loudly to his girlfriend who stood next to him, as they threw stones in the water fountain.*

*A young girl noticed Teresa in the distance and started to skip down the path towards her.*

Teresa: (What is this twinkling feeling?) *She stopped and looked to her side, staring at the statue.* "Tcch, so far everything I have done-"

*Teresa looked annoyed and stepped to the side, walking towards the statue.*

Teresa: "-Has caused me to lose respect in myself, why resist these abnormal and pointless thoughts furthermore?" *She mumbled to herself, as a relaxing breeze wafted past her.*

Young Girl: "Wow-" *She rudely stopped beside Teresa, staring at her in awe.* "You look fantastic!" *She giggled and flicked the robes which flapped off Teresa's arms.*

Teresa: "Such useless words are meaningless." *She sternly swayed her arm away and continued to walk towards the statue.*

Young Girl: "Huh?"

Teresa: "Little girls should keep quiet and listen to their parents." *She had a flashback of ignoring Tarlea's words to step into the teleportation glyph.*

Villager: *She looked puzzled and shook her head with ignorance, skipping after Teresa.* "My name is Violet."

Teresa: "Violet? A colour? Tcch, how pointless. A name is a name, it does not matter what that name is."

Violet: "You contradicted yourself?"

Teresa: *She glared at Violet, as she continued to walk towards the statue.* "Inconceivable!"

Violet: *She tilted her head at an angle.* "You're really strange, has anyone told you that?"

Teresa: "No one would dare." *She stopped in front of the statue and stood still, unsure what to do.*

Violet: "Well-?" *She gasped in happiness, realising what Teresa was doing.* "You're here for the ceremony, aren't you?! Wee hee!" *She skipped up to the statue, twirling around in a childish manner.*

Teresa: "Why would I perform such childish-?"

Violet: "It makes me happy." *She rudely cut off Teresa and skipped forward, gently placing her hand on the statue.*

Teresa: "Happy?" *She sounded unimpressed, staring at Violet's back with an emotionless face.*

Violet: *She turned around and faced Teresa, stamping her foot in front of Teresa.* "You know, happy, like this-"

Teresa: "Hoh?"

Violet: *She pulled her cheeks up with her fingers, making a clown-like smile.* "See."

Teresa: "It was childishness like that, that caused the downfall of my mother, such an inexcusable behaviour-" *She gritted her teeth, glaring at the statue.* "Tcch." (I despise myself.)

Violet: "Hey!" *She stepped forward, grabbing Teresa's arm.* "When I get sad, I do this to make me happy."

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She quickly looked away with a disgusted face.*

Violet: "Mummy and Daddy told me to do something I like when I'm sad. And I like the ceremony."

Teresa: *She looked down to Violet and remained silent.* (Such a childish view on the subject, no matter what this girl says, she can not change my mind.)

Violet: "I dance when I'm sad and I dance when I'm happy." *She started to shake Teresa's arm, filling herself with excitement.* "Why don't you do The Purafetic Ceremony with me?"

Teresa: *She pulled her arm out of Violet's grip and stepped back, turning around.* "Because the mere thought of doing something so trivial saddens me. Humph."

Violet: "...?"

Teresa: (As I earlier predicted, what a waste of time, I could already be halfway to Surpreon by now!-)

Violet: "If you're already sad, and if the dance makes you sad-"

Teresa: "Such assumptions!" *She shouted in a stern manner while walking away.*

Violet: "Huh?" *She slightly tilted her head, staring at Teresa's back in confusion.*

Teresa: "You assumed I am sad, how childish-"

Violet: "Then, what have you got to lose?"

Teresa: "Hoh?" *She stopped in mid-step, staring in front with widening eyes.*

Violet: "That's what Daddy says, because I acted the same as you."

Teresa: *She abruptly turned around, glaring at Violet.* "You dare say my reaction is that of a child's?!"

Violet: "N-No, no, no, no." *She shook her head for further clarification.*

Teresa: "Lance is a man-child and petulant, being compared to such a trait is unfathomable and inconceivable!"

Violet: *She raised her arms while continuing to shake her head.* "I mean, I know how you feel-"

Teresa: "I do not feel anything!" *She stormed up to Violet, pointing at the statue.* "If I do the insignificant dance, I will not magically regain anything!"

Violet: "I guess you're right. Since you obviously done this before."

Teresa: *She breathed heavily and placed a hand on her forehead in frustration, due to Violet's childish answers.* "I have merely watched on numerous accounts."

Violet: "Then how do you know-?"

Teresa: *She grabbed a handful of Violet's robes and leant closer, staring into her eyes for intimidation.* "Children should not talk back."

Violet: *She stood on her toes and nodded her head in respect, purposely keeping quiet.* (She's scary.) *She watched Teresa let go and start to walk away, causing her to step back in shock.*

Teresa: "This is coming from someone who calculates all encounters and meticulously plans ahead."

Violet: *She stared at Teresa's back, scraping one foot forward.* "..."

Teresa: "It is an insult when someone judges something when they have yet to experience it for them... Selves." *She stopped in realisation, gasping with widening eyes.*

Violet: "Umm, I know you told me not to talk, but you said you haven't done the ceremony yourself?"

Teresa: "I-Indeed.." *She spoke as if she knew where the conversation was headed.*

Violet: "So, how do you know what the outcome will be?"

Teresa: "Obviously by calc-"

Violet: "How would you plan ahead with that?" *She looked at Teresa with sincerity, squeaking like a child.*

Teresa: *She turned around, facing Violet with an emotionless face.* "Tcch! I will prove to you that I am correct." *She walked towards Violet, as a faint glow shined off her hair caused by the moonlight.*

Violet: "How will you do that?" *She tilted her head and braided her hair like a child.*

Teresa: "I will perform The Purafetic Ceremony, and I will teach you a lesson. Never question another's action of experience if you have yet to experience it for yourself."

Violet: "Umm, okay!" *She smiled obliviously to what happened.*

Teresa: *She started to tap her feet, as she readied herself to do the dance.* "I will-"

Violet: "What are you doing?!" *She stamped her foot, pouting like a child.*

Teresa: "Are your eyes deficient? I am clearly starting the dance."

Violet: "You have to wait a little longer." *She looked up, staring at the bright blue moon.*

Teresa: "Stop being a nuisance, there is no need to wait."

Violet: "Shh you-" *She pointed up, trying to draw Teresa's attention to the sky.*

Teresa: "Hoh-?"

Violet: "I've done this a lot, but..." *She lowered her arm, sighing in a nervous manner.* "This will be the first time I'll be doing it by myself."

Teresa: *She stared at Violet with an emotionless face.* ".. If you shh me again, I will-"

Violet: *She noticed villagers slowly approaching in the distance.* (They must have finished their rest.) "When the moon is at its peak, we can draw the freshest Astragons, or Neurons, I forget."

Teresa: "Humph, I have no need to waste further time-"

Violet: "B-But you're going to prove me wrong, right?"

Teresa: "Tcch." *She hesitantly nodded her head, gritting her teeth in an annoyed manner.*

Violet: "Wee hee, okay so-" *She skipped up to Teresa and held her hand.* "Move your feet like this-" *She looked down, adjusting her feet in a starting position.*

Teresa: (How pitiful-) *She looked down with a sigh, mimicking Violet's stance.*

Violet: "Right, now, feel the Neurons in the air as they swirl the space."

Teresa: "Your logic is incorrect, Astragons are-"

Violet: "Who cares?" *She squealed and let go of Teresa's hand, slowly spinning in a circle.*

Teresa: "Ah?" *She looked confused, awkwardly copying Violet's movements.* (I will prove this foolish child wrong.)

*The city glowed slightly brighter due to the moonlight, as the moon drifted to its peak.*

Violet: "Do you feel it?" *She giggled and spun around again.*

Teresa: (I can not get the rhythm, I can not enjoy this, this is not enjoyable.) *She swirled around and stopped, causing her hair to gently fold over her face.*

Violet: "Let our soul and spirits become free-" *She softly sung under her breath, crouching down.*

Teresa: *She crouched to the ground, as she looked to her side at Violet.* (Perhaps the girl served a use after all, if I decided to do this-) *She jumped up at the same time and rocked her bottom from side to side.* (I do not know any of the lyrics or scores to this dance.)

Violet: "Remove the origins of our life Soul Link and become free like the holy breeze you crafted for us." *She flicked her hair in circles and leapt forward on one toe.*

*Villagers started to crowd around, purposely keeping quiet.*

Teresa: *She stared at the statue with an emotionless face and her arms swayed in front, causing her eyes to widen.* (My arms? They moved by themselves-?) *Her face lit up with curiosity, intrigued by the unknown.*

Violet: "..." *Her face filled with serenity, as she moved her arms in a fluid manner.*

Teresa: *She stepped back and forth, mimicking Violet's steps perfectly.* (No, my arms did not move on their own accord. I knew what to do?)

*Several villagers sat down and started to hit drums, giving a beat for Violet to step to.*

Violet: "The passion of emotion, the fury of battle, the love of fear, the fear of love-" *She flipped forward and jumped up, spinning in the air.*

Teresa: *She mimicked Violet's movements with ease, landing on one foot.* (How does this girl possess such acrobatic skills?)

Violet: "Feel our drive through our emotion!" *She started to sing with emphasis and emotion, as her movements became more extreme.*

*Teresa and Violet's dance synced with the drumbeats, matching Violet's singing.*

Teresa: (I sense power from her?) *She glanced at Violet who appeared to be in her own world.* (Those energy signatures! How foolish on my behalf, she is a Score User!)

Violet: "Throw away our distant heartaches and attract the positives motions!" *She closed her eyes and threw her arms in the air, causing a massive blue glyph to draw itself under her.*

Teresa: *She instinctively closed her eyes and started to enthusiastically dance with Violet.* (My body, what is it doing?) *She started to breathe through her mouth and The Grand Seal started to react.*

Violet: "We will never back down, no matter what troubles we face, this is our life!" *She spun in a tight circle, giving the illusion she twirled on ice.*

Teresa: *She slightly opened her eyes, watching the area turn black like an Ougi.* (My forehead hurts... But, I do not care?)

Violet: "I said, this is our life!-"

*Villagers in robes jogged behind Teresa and Violet and started to dance.*

Violet: "Open the path that lets us live the way we want!" *She enthusiastically rocked back, swaying her arms up and down in a gymnastics-like manner.*

*Teresa and Violet started to sweat, ignoring the row of villagers who danced in their shadows.*

Violet and Teresa: "Watch our bodies move in sync to the battle notion of our hyped up motion!"

*The drums echoed due to the Astragons, which warped the midnight atmosphere around them.*

Violet and Teresa: "You can't possibly expect us to break down!"

Teresa: *Her eyes twitched, as tiny black orbs started to eat itself off her Grand Seal.* (Argh, it hurts but-) *She spun her arms in front and kneeled down, watching her hair flap upwards.*

*Blue glyphs shot up from the ground and spiralled around the villagers.*

Violet and Teresa: "Never back down, it's now and forever!" *Their voices echoed, as if they were casting Rostical.* "We just want to live the way we want! It's not yours, but our life!"

*Violet, Teresa and the villagers jumped high into the air and somersaulted towards the ground.*

Teresa: *She landed on the ground with ease, slightly smiling in concentration.* "I am going to be what I want, I want to live for what I desire and I have the desire to live!"

*Teresa closed her eyes and inappropriately rocked her body, moving her back in a fluid motion.*

Violet: "Let our sorrows be heard and ignored!" *She stopped and enthusiastically looked up, reaching for the sky.*

Teresa: *She opened her eyes and reached towards the moon, as The Grand Seal disrupted and disintegrated into the air.* "Let our sorrows-"

Violet: "Be heard-"

Teresa: "-And ignored!" *She watched light fill the area, as it reverted back to normal.*

Violet: *She watched the blue glyphs disintegrate into nothing, holding her chest with one arm in exhaustion.* "Done."

Teresa: "Done..?"

Violet: "I feel really good, wee hee." (I wonder if the cut I have healed like Tanja's?)

Teresa: *She breathed deeply and looked at Violet triumphantly.* "That was amazing-"

*The villagers applaud each other and yelled in happiness, catching Violet and Teresa's attention.*

Teresa: *She gasped in shock and covered her mouth, witnessing the crowd around her.* (What is this feeling? Scared?)

Violet: *She inhaled, wiping her face with her robes.* "Look at everyone, I'm embarrassed."

Teresa: "Embarrassed? I see."

Violet: "So-" *She pulled up the sleeve to her robe, observing a large scar across her arm.*

Teresa: "Hoh?" *She looked at the scar, placing her finger on it.*

Violet: "W-Wow, it's healed! I only did this a few days ago."

Teresa: "Inconceivable."

Violet: "The Purafetic Ceremony uses the freshest Astragons." *Two villagers ran from the crowd, shouting out Violet's name.*

Teresa: (The purest of Astragons? It is plausible it contains healing properties-) *She focused her attention on the villagers and looked uncomfortable, glancing at Violet.* "I thank you."

Violet: "Thank you, too-"

Teresa: "..." *She looked to the side, sighing with a disappearing image.*

Violet: (Wow, she disappeared!-) *She smiled in the space where Teresa stood, recalling the brief time spent with her.*

Female: "Violet!"

Violet: *She looked up to the villagers, taking a deep breath.* "Mummy, Daddy, it worked, wee hee."

Female: "You should be more careful, honey!"

Male: "Violet, you should let us know what you were doing, we were worried sick."

Violet: "You're right, sorry." *She nodded her head, showing her arm.* "But look, it's healed."

Male: "You should've waited until Joy or Chrisma returned-" *He spoke with annoyance, suddenly smiling in a relieved manner.*

Teresa: *She suddenly appeared inside Joy's house, instantly collapsing to the floor.* "W-What-?" *She gasped and inhaled with a stutter, listening to the sounds of cheering villagers outside.* "My forehead no longer hurts-"

*Teresa wheezed and looked to the ground with widening eyes as if she was going to throw up.*

Teresa: "What is this-? Memories? My Journey? The day at The Library-?"

*Teresa slightly squinted her eyes, watching sweat drip on to the floor.*

Teresa: "The moment I encountered Lance, Ashton and Alicia-" *She gasped under her breath, recollecting the events of her journey.*

*Teresa groaned as the onslaught of memories overwhelmed her.*

Teresa: *Images flashed in her head of each party member looking at her strangely, due to her emotionless answers.* (I have been horrible.)

*Glimpses of Ashton flashed in her head, causing her to gag in despair.*

Teresa: "No! Ashton! Millard! Cassandra!" *She shook her head consumed with sorrow and disbelief.*

*Drums and vocals could be heard, as the villagers performed another version of The Purafetic Ceremony.*

Teresa: *The background sounds became mute.* "I had no idea what I missed-... Half of this quest, half of which I have paid no attention to."

*Teresa gasped again, gritting her teeth in realisation.*

Teresa: (Those people have befriended me despite having such a cold heart.) *She punched the floor, causing the area to rumble and lights to flicker.*

*Teresa whimpered in emotional weakness and rolled to her side, watching her fingers shake.*

Teresa: *Images of Ridley smirking caused her to stop whimpering.* (Ridley!)

*Teresa suddenly frowned with anger and stood up, wiping the tears off her face.*

Teresa: "How dare he do what he has done! He enslaved mother-" *She grunted in rage and faced the door, mentally preparing herself.* "I do not know how, but I will confront Ridley myself!"

?????: "Teresa, I don't have much time left."

Teresa: *She turned around in shock, instantly noticing a woman bent over on the stairs.* (I did not sense her!)

?????: *Her hair covered her face.* "Time is vital."

Teresa: *She stood straight with a red puffy face, proudly taking a step forward.* "Explain yourself!-"

?????: "The Consultant wants to obtain the power of light-" *She wheezed, causing her figure to distort.*

Teresa: *Her eyes widened.* (It's an illusion.) "J-Jewel?!"

Jewel: "Yes, but-" *Teresa's image disappeared, causing her to awkwardly stop in distress.*

-

Teresa: "But?" *She appeared underground in a dark room, catching Jewel off guard.*

Jewel: "Oh?" *She sounded surprised, looking at Teresa's dark figure.* "I don't think I have much time left."

Teresa: "Here-" *She flashstepped and touched a glyph, causing the room to light up.*

Jewel: *She panted in exhaustion against the wall, struggling to hold her head up.* "W-What are you doing? I-I just wanted to forewarn you about-"

Teresa: "It is fortunate you showed yourself, I would have forgotten about the orb altogether."

Jewel: "Please listen-"

Teresa: *She reached behind her back, staring at Jewel with watering eyes.* "B-Be quiet, save your energy."

Jewel: "You don't understand-"

Teresa: *She pulled her arm forward, revealing a small clear orb.* "This can heal any Neuron or Astragon disorder."

Jewel: *She paused in shock, awkwardly licking her cold, flaky lips.* "No, it's too late."

Teresa: *She shook her head, walking over to Jewel.* "This orb-"

Jewel: "K-Kerh-harh." *She suddenly wheezed, as black, gooey-like blood oozed out from her nose.*

Teresa: *She noticed the blood and bent down, placing the small orb in Jewel's hand.* "This was given to me by someone whom I can trust."

Jewel: *She closed her eyes and gasped in pain, as her body started to react to the orb.* "Th-There's something I want to tell you."

Teresa: "Save your-"

Jewel: "-When we were attacked, Tarlea showed me this, in a Crystalline Membrane."

Teresa: "How?"

Jewel: "Through-"

Teresa: "How are you alive?" *Her eyes were in a continuous glaze-like state.*

Jewel: "Sorrowprax, after that day, I encountered Tarlea there numerous times."

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She looked away, hiding her interest.*

Jewel: *She struggled to lift her arms, causing Teresa to frown.* "Here...-"

Teresa: "Despite your condition, I do not like to repeat-"

Jewel: *She placed her fingers on Teresa's temples causing her to gasp.* (I can show you the memory through my power-)

--

Tarlea: "Typhoon's Pulse." *She nudged her finger and a blast of wind pushed Teresa into the air.*

Teresa: "Why-?!" *She tumbled across the ground towards the purple light, causing the glyph to instantly flash in response.*

Tarlea: *She watched Teresa disappear with the fading glyph, causing her to look down to her chest in accomplishment.* (It's the least I could do for you...)

*Tarlea grunted and held her chest, causing streams of blood to run down her arm.*

Tarlea: "Three powerful Ancioldrants happen to strike after a very strenuous training session-"

*A spine-chilling breeze blew past Tarlea, causing her long blonde hair to flap in front of her.*

Tarlea: "Beings that possessed colossal strength and the ability to hide in a mere Spacial Funnel were able to mask their presence completely?"

*Tarlea looked down, observing the blood streams on her arm and hand, caused by the dark spear.*

Tarlea: "At first, I believed they hid in a Reality Sekai-... But it doesn't make sense-"

*All dirt and traces of the Ancioldrants disappeared in another gust of wind.*

Tarlea: "Just after being forced to use my Ougi which temporarily drains my Neurons completely-"

*Tarlea whispered to herself, as blood dripped from her mouth.*

Tarlea: "Which only a few people know about its weakness, then a spear coincidentally pierces me in a critical area-... Show yourself!"

Ridley: *He flashstepped in front of Tarlea and stepped back to a safe distance, smiling in disappointment at himself.* "Oh? Dang, what gave me away?"

Tarlea: *She frowned in anger, slightly tilting her head down.* "You bastard."

Ridley: "Ouch, Tarley, you don't mind if I call you that?"

Tarlea: "I've been loyal, why?!"

Ridley: "To be honest, your morals are higher than mine, and I could see you getting in my way."

Tarlea: "In your way?"

Ridley: "Well, whenever I initiate my plans in the future." *He continued to smile, taking several cautious steps towards her.*

Tarlea: *She gritted her teeth, which was red of blood.* "What a ridiculous-" *She bent forward, violently coughing up blood.*

Ridley: "Tarley-"

Tarlea: "Get rid of the ridiculous smirk, it sickens me."

Ridley: *He appeared slightly offended, trying to analyse her sudden disrespectful attitude.* "Oh, Tarley, afraid of death?"

Tarlea: "If you thought I would get in your way-"

Ridley: "Please don't play me as a fool, I knew you were already second guessing my orders."

Tarlea: *She smirked and dropped to the ground, looking at Ridley with double vision.* "So you knew?" *She squinted her eyes, as grass poked around her cheeks.*

Ridley: *He looked at his fingernails as if he didn't care for Tarlea.* "Oh, yeah, sure. So, I'm here to give you an offer."

Tarlea: "Before that, why did you kill the number ones?"

Ridley: *He paused, taking the time to think about it.* "I admit, it was unfortunate, but in order for me to accomplish my ambitions I can't let anyone get in my way."

Tarlea: "Tcch." (I don't even know what his plans are, but it really does sicken me.)

Ridley: "I have an offer-"

*Moans caught Ridley's attention, causing him to look past Tarlea.*

Ridley: "Hmm?"

*Ridley suddenly flashstepped next to Jewel and looked down, inspecting her with a surprised smile.*

Ridley: (Well, well, well, she's still alive. I do need someone of number one material to test the black orb on. Or, at least, when I create it.) *He smirked and clicked his fingers, causing Jewel to disappear in a cloud of darkness.*

Tarlea: "What about, Terra?"

Ridley: *He turned around and flashstepped next to Tarlea, kneeling down with a smirk.* "Who?"

Tarlea: "Teresa."

Ridley: "Ah, her-" *He chuckled and stood back up, slightly walking around Tarlea.* "She definitely has inherited your natural abilities, hasn't she?"

Tarlea: "What will you do with her?"

Ridley: "Well, from her perspective, you were attacked by three Ancioldrants. She has no idea what really happened now, does she?" *He smiled, cupping his hands in a professional manner.*

Tarlea: "No-" *She admittedly revealed, coughing out more blood.*

Ridley: "Before something else interrupts us. I have an offer for you."

Tarlea: "..." *She lay motionless, waiting to hear Ridley's proposal.*

Ridley: "I can heal your wounds, but under one condition."

Tarlea: "Healing?" *She spoke under her breath, triggering a flashback of kissing Teresa's forehead.* "Tcch, you have no holy powers."

Ridley: *He sighed with annoyance, keeping his composure.* "Stop getting sidetracked-"

Tarlea: "What condition?" *She wheezed and gasped, lowering her head on the ground.* (I don't have much longer.)

Ridley: "You'll be bound to my orders, that's all." *He shrugged his shoulders and smirked, symbolising it wasn't a big thing.*

Tarlea: "At what cost if I break this condition?"

Ridley: "Your powers will go into me and you'll die, simple as that."

Tarlea: (He wants my Radiatons?) *She looked away without moving her head.* (I would like.. I want to farewell my children-)

Ridley: "Tarley?"

Tarlea: (.. Caesar's captain exams will be coming up shortly-)

Ridley: *He continued to smirk, closely observing Tarlea's facial expressions.* (She must be considering it-)

Tarlea: (Terra's number one ceremony, heh, she'll obviously make the mark for it. And Amy, with no Remenistal powers-)

Ridley: (Although she might want to think faster, it would seem she's reaching towards the critical loss of Neurons.) *He opened his hands, revealing tattoo-like markings akin to a Self-inflicting Glyph.*

Tarlea: "Even if I comply, how would you create this offer-?" *She looked at Ridley, instantly noticing the markings around his hand.* "Forbidden!"

Ridley: "Forbidden?"

Tarlea: "Those markings are from the lost ages of Radiaton-filled Elementalists. Those glyphs were designed to keep The Sacred Knights from ever breaking their moral codes."

Ridley: "Oh my, knowledgeable, as expected from the great Tarlea Seraph."

Tarlea: "How do you possess such knowledge-"

Ridley: "Come on, Tarley. You should know, time isn't your friend right now?"

Tarlea: "Please explain the point of this entire ordeal. I was following your orders as leader of The Black Brigade."

Ridley: "That is true, yet, with this, you are bound to not betray me." *He smirked and bent his knees, presenting his hand closer to Tarlea's face.*

Tarlea: (I would've said no instantly, but I want to see my children grow up-) *She sighed in sadness, as her bloody fingers twitched with coldness.* (-And to have a proper farewell, before I see everyone in The Astral Plains.)

Ridley: "Last chance." *He spoke in a stern voice, unintentionally showing his impatience.*

Tarlea: *She awkwardly smiled in pain, gritting her teeth.* "Okay."

Ridley: "Splendid." *He smirked and shook Tarlea's hand, causing the black lines to burn into her skin.* "Although, the damages your body sustained will still need to be healed."

Tarlea: *Her arm twitched, as the black lines travelled up.* "Healed?" *She grunted in pain, trying to keep consciousness.*

Ridley: *He opened his other hand, revealing a blue stone.* "I forget what these items are called-"

Tarlea: "Genesis Stones."

Ridley: *He smirked at her knowledge, grunting in respect.* "As you know, I don't possess the power of light, so I'll need to freeze your entity-"

Tarlea: "W-What-?!"

*The stone in Ridley's hand glowed and an ice pillar shot up from the ground, sealing Tarlea in crystal-like ice.*

Kath: *She flashstepped next to Ridley, causing the grass to pulse around her.* "Is it completed?"

Ridley: *He turned around, bowing in respect.* "Yes, it is."

*Four captains flashstepped behind Kath and Ridley, causing their armour to rattle in the breeze.*

Kath: "Excellent-" *She stared at Tarlea in the ice, pushing her glasses up with one finger.* "Take her to a room and await further instructions."

Ridley: "Yes." *He looked around and paused in confusion, expecting to see a different scenery.*

Kath: "Why am I waiting?!" *She closed her eyes and sounded annoyed, which alerted the captains to flashstep in front of her.* "Prepare the teleportation glyph!"

Captains: "Ma'am." *They all spoke at the same time, as they started an incantation.*

Kath: *She focused her attention back to the crystal, watching the ice sparkle in the sunlight.* (Tarlea Seraph. I have flashback-like dreams from Valhalla... Our Radiaton filled eyes...)

Ridley: "What are you thinking about?" *He spoke with an emotionless face, watching purple lines draw themselves on the ground.*

Kath: "Why exactly do we need to freeze her? Why not bind or seal her in a Reality Sekai?"

Ridley: "It will halt her body, so we'll be able to heal the damage she received from my attack."

Kath: "Hermm? Too bad we don't have a technique to heal."

Ridley: *He stared at the captains in silence, watching purple light shimmer off their armour.* (The power to heal-)

Kath: (Having Tarlea, an entity stronger than a number one completely under our control-) *She smirked in thought, as her eyes glowed an eerie yellow colour.*

Captains: "Ready!"

Ridley: (This warrior system seems to be playing into effect quite neatly.) *He watched the captains hold hands, causing a wide ranged glyph to teleport them out of the area.*

--

Teresa: "I see." *She faced away from Jewel, trying to hold back her tears.*

Jewel: *The dark veins on her face and body were no longer visible.* "Yes, he pretty much used me as an experiment."

Teresa: "Th-That is terrible!"

Jewel: *She stood up as if she regained her energy.* "I know where he could be."

Teresa: "How would that be possible? The only times I have sensed his power was when he confronted us with his true identity-"

*Teresa spoke in desperation, having a flashback of the fight in Surpreon's central.*

Teresa: "And when he posed as Riddle." *She had flashbacks of walking past him in the corridor of Season's manor.*

Jewel: "This-"

Teresa: *She looked over her shoulder, staring at Jewel's hands with anticipation.* (What could it be?)

Jewel: *She grabbed her arm and tightly held it, causing steam of shadow to rise around her fingers.* "I still have his darkness in me. I can track it before it fully dissipates into the air."

Teresa: *She tightened her fists and closed her eyes, causing tears to run down her face.* "He was already bad-"

Jewel: "Teresa?"

Teresa: *She opened her eyes and faced Jewel, frowning with anger filled eyes.* "I will take him on myself!"

Jewel: *She silently nodded her head and looked to the door leading outside.* "..."

Teresa: (My adventure with the party, I have missed so much-) *She silently thought to herself.* (It feels like, I have not been part of this story, as I had no care at all. I will avenge you mother and all those who suffered by the monster's hand!) *She frowned at an image of Ridley in her head.*

Jewel: "Teresa?"

Teresa: "Let's go." *She grunted in a low tone as if she was the acting party leader.*

*Teresa and Jewel flashstepped out of the underground room and out of The Lost City.*

Jewel: *The area blurred past her as she ran at flashstepping speeds.* "I've picked up his Neuron signature!"

Teresa: *She ran with her arms swaying behind her back, looking to her side at Jewel.* "Already?" *She slightly smirked with anger, as if she knew she was going to hurt him.*

Jewel: *She focused her attention ahead, squinting her eyes with concentration.* "Yes."

Teresa: (I will get him!) *She started to run faster with a widening smile, grunting to herself with rage.*

Jewel: (Although, his Neuron signature is different? How is that possible? What changed? Or is it just the darkness leaving my body?)

----------

*A purple glyph formed itself on vacant land near the outskirts of Skyler's Isle.*

PKMY: *She stepped off the fading glyph and collapsed onto the ground.* "Mummy."

*PKMY mumbled and shook her head, frowning in recollection.*

PKMY: "Mummy says I have to let go.." *She grunted to herself and stood up, looking over her shoulder into the distance.* "Purge."

*PKMY whispered in sadness and inhaled the salty air, as the wind carried the ocean's smell and sounds.*

PKMY: *She faced away from the ocean and started to walk inland.* (You didn't have to go, Purge, mummy-) *She thought with quivering lips and bent forward, flashstepping into the landscape.*

----------

*Jewel and Teresa flashstepped into a backwater village, causing surrounding dirt to blow away.*

Teresa: "I do not sense him?" *She looked at Jewel worried.*

Jewel: *She quickly looked to each side, nodding her head with a frown.* "You're right, to the next location." *She motioned her head to follow, flashstepping out of the village.*

Teresa: "Ridley, I will wipe the floor with you." *She whispered to herself in anger, as her image disappeared.*

Chapter 4: PKMY's Tale

Tarlea: "That was a long time ago and I've dealt with the turmoil. But Amy, you're also trapped with emotions, but for opposite reasons."

PKMY: "How?! My emotions give me my drive-"

Tarlea: "Love."

PKMY: "W-What-? Shut up, what do you know?!"

Tarlea: "I know far more than I let on. Don't try and forget something because it hurts, the good moments in our lives including the bad ones make us who we are today. You aren't weak to give up on a lover, it means you're strong enough to let go."

PKMY: "I don't want to let go-"

Tarlea: "And therefore trapped, completely oblivious to those who care for and love you."

*PKMY grunted in recollection and flashstepped into an ordinary grassy valley, focusing her attention to a calm lake.*

PKMY: *She walked towards the lake and stopped, staring at a small cottage-like village in the distance.* (Memories are already flooding back.)

*PKMY wrapped her arms over her shoulders, comforting herself in thought.*

PKMY: (To think, my life changed in this little shithole-)

*Sunlight shimmered on a small running stream in the background and random patches of yellow flowers grew near the lake.*

PKMY: (This was after Teresa and Season entered into the ranks of the warriors.)

*A large windmill slowly spun in a clockwise motion, powered by the wind in the nearby village.*

PKMY: *She stepped forward and stared at the lake, watching the water glisten in the sun.* (This place.. Became hidden in time..) *She flashstepped across the tiny lake, causing a path-like stream of water to burst into the air.*

*PKMY flashstepped on the outskirts of the backwater village, as spraying water glittered around her.*

PKMY: *She waved the water away, slowly walking towards the village.* (I never would've thought I'd visit this place again-)

*The wind eerily howled, causing the old wooden houses to creak.*

PKMY: *She stepped into the village and looked to each side, closely observing her surroundings in detail.* (This place has been abandoned for ages.)

*PKMY stood under a tree next to a miniature bridge, listening to the distant sounds of running water.*

PKMY: (My story occurred years ago..)

*PKMY looked up, ignoring the buzzing sounds of cicadas in the background.*

PKMY: (When I was fourteen before I slowed the ageing process via Astragons.) *She held her arm and looked up through the branches, sighing with growing loneliness.*

--

*A woman with long blonde, curly hair stood on one knee, dressing a young red-haired girl in a palace appearing room.*

Woman: *She held the girl by the shoulders, awkwardly smiling in a motherly manner.* "It's for the best."

Girl: "But-"

Woman: "No buts, Amy. Darkness is lurking, growing stronger... I don't want to put you in that position."

Amy: "..." *She frowned and pouted, looking down to shiny, new appearing floors.*

PKMY: "The colours in the room were bright and vibrant, always giving it a sense of royalty. Red, blue, brown and green carpet-like material hung off the walls for decorative purposes.. Heh, it's funny how your memory recalls things like decoration. I find it so annoyingly selective."

Woman: *She sighed in a weary manner, looking at Amy from top to bottom.* "Your new dress looks beautiful on you-"

Amy: "Mother-. I don't want to go!-"

*A man dressed in holy garbs barged into the room covered in sweat, intensely staring at the woman*

Man: "Please excuse me, Tarlea!-"

Tarlea: *She focused her attention away from Amy and to the man.* "Not right now, can you not see I am in the middle of something important?"

Man: *His body shook in fear, slightly facing the door.* (She must be stressed, she's never rude like that.) "I-I am sorry, captain!" *He spoke in respect and bowed, quickly leaving the room.*

--

PKMY: (This happened way before I became a warrior, and... Before that horrible day-) *Her red hair gently swayed in the soft breeze.* (When I found out she died from an Ancioldrant attack.)

--

Tarlea: *She listened to the man's footsteps fade into the background.* (They must be present, or close-)

Amy: "Mummy-"

Tarlea: *She focused her attention back to Amy, smiling in a proud manner.* "I am sorry, what was that?"

Amy: *She tightly held onto her dress, trying to hold back her tears.* "I don't want to go."

Tarlea: *She ignored Amy with a sigh and fixed up her hair.* "There, all done." *She kneeled up and faced Amy towards a mirror.*

--

PKMY: (To think, my hair use to be as long as Teresa's or that I loved wearing dresses..) "Tssk." *She casually leant against the tree, rolling her eyes in recollection.*

--

Amy: *She stared at herself in a mirror.* "But why do I have to go? I want to be a warrior, too."

Tarlea: "Terra and Caesar are warriors, that doesn't mean you have to be one as well."

Amy: (I just want to be like Caesar and Terra.) *She pouted, looking over her shoulder to Tarlea.*

Tarlea: *She shook her head as if she could understand Amy's thoughts.* "You have your own abilities to focus on-"

Amy: "I-I want to be like them!"

Tarlea: "Amy.. Your father, a powerful member of The Wise once told me-" *She paused, waiting for Amy to respond.*

Amy: "Yes..?"

Tarlea: "Find what you excel in and go past your limits, make yourself known! Because, to be forgotten is far worse than any death."

Amy: "I-I don't understand...?"

Tarlea: "You will one day.."

Amy: (What has that got to do with me being a warrior?)

Tarlea: *She paused and looked concerned, as the atmosphere became visibly heavy.* (That Neuron signature! It's undoubtedly Consultant level!) "And now we have to go."

Amy: *She noticed Tarlea's deep in thought facial expression.* "Mummy?"

Tarlea: (But who? Millardestel seems to be good-natured and Kathalestel seems oblivious, it must be Ridley-)

Amy: "Ahem?"

Tarlea: *She quickly focused on Amy and smiled.* "I don't want my youngest becoming a warrior too."

Amy: "You won't have to worry-"

*Loud yells were heard outside, instantly catching Tarlea's attention.*

Tarlea: *She grabbed Amy's arm with a fading smile.* "We need to leave now. They're here!"

Amy: (Who's here-?)

Tarlea: "Power of the forbidden spirits, come to my command, with seraphic powers-"

Amy: "Why are we leaving anyway? I thought this palace was the divine-"

Tarlea: "TELEPORTATION"

Amy: *She gasped with uncertainty and looked down, watching lines draw themselves on the ground.* "Mummy?!"

*The glyph formed two triangles and rotated around Amy and Tarlea, instantly teleporting them out of the room in a flash of purple light.*

-

*A female-figured warrior with the number twenty-nine on her back, ran across a large hallway.*

Twenty-Nine: (This is a mountain-sized palace.) *She ran towards Ridley, noticing a party of warriors clustered around him.*

Ridley: *The warrior's echoing footsteps caught his attention.* "Oh well, that's no good."

*A man without a helmet with the number twenty-six on his back armour looked at Ridley in confusion.*

Twenty-Six: "Sir?"

Ridley: "Twenty-six?"

Twenty-Six: "What do you mean, that's no good?"

Ridley: "Is it not obvious-?" *He spread his arms, shaking his head.* "We haven't found anything."

Twenty-Six: "How do you know?"

Ridley: (Valhalla... Tarlea, you crafty lady, without any evidence, I'll have to play the dumb card...)

Twenty-Nine: *She ran up to Ridley and kneeled down, panting through her helmet.* (As a tax debt collector, I excel in great long distant durability, but this palace.. I'm exhausted.)

*The massive hallway of the palace was huge, causing the slightest sound to echo. Walls were pure white and a bright red carpet with yellow Remenistal glyphs rolled all the way down the floor.*

Ridley: "Speak."

Twenty-Nine: (The Consultant, he's very frightening to be around.) "Sir! The targets were not found. And an activation of a forbidden Remenistal was used just a moment-"

Ridley: "Don't you think I know that?" *He smirked, glancing at the warrior on her knees.*

Twenty-Nine: "Y-Yes."

Ridley: *He looked at each warrior, humming in thought.* "Kath, Millard and friends will never find out about this. Understood?"

The Party: "Yes, sir!" *Six different voices echoed together, as they loyally agreed to Ridley's commands.*

Ridley: (I only took a six-member party for this secret mission.) *He mumbled in thought, placing his finger on his lips.* (I have a feeling Tarlea is planning a betrayal and I was hoping to catch her out today-)

Twenty-Nine: *She kneeled up, causing her armour to rattle with a slight echo.* "What would you like us to do now?"

Ridley: "Although, this isn't the actual city of Valhalla, this is one of its divine palaces, are you sure there aren't any people here?"

Twenty-Six: "That is correct, I have yet to encounter anyone."

Ridley: *He looked slightly disappointed, closing his eyes in defeat.* (They're long gone.. I did find it strange that we could enter its Astragon barrier so easily.. Pity, I would've enjoyed searching for a culture that hides in these halls-)

Twenty-Six: "Orders, sir?"

Ridley: *He sighed and opened his eyes, glancing at each warrior.* "Let's leave, I have other things I need to prepare."

*The warriors nodded their heads and adjusted their armour, preparing themselves to leave.*

-

*A glowing glyph formed itself on top of a small grassy hill and Tarlea and Amy suddenly appeared in a flash of purple light.*

Tarlea: "Phew." *She stepped off the glyph, swaying hair out of her face.* (I tried to minimise the Neurons in the teleportation to reduce the chance of being tracked. I could have teleported much further than this if I hadn't..)

Amy: *She struggled to stand and fell backwards, whimpering in confusion.* "I feel sick."

Tarlea: "No time, we need to move." *She grabbed Amy's hand, pulling her up with ease.* (Be strong my little one.)

PKMY: (That crazy woman is my mummy. You wouldn't think someone so beautiful would be the strongest being alive, right?)

Amy: (Eww, there's dirt on my hands.)

Tarlea: *She heard people chatter in the background, causing her to scan the area around her.* "It appears a small village is near."

Amy: *She rubbed her hands together, trying to brush off the dirt in disgust.* "Where are we going?"

Tarlea: "I am sorry, Amy. I want you to be in a safe place-"

*Amy and Tarlea felt an earthquake, causing them to lose their balance.*

Tarlea: (What?!) *She quickly turned around, staring into the distance in shock.*

Amy: "M-Mummy-?!" *She screeched in fear, grabbing onto Tarlea's robes.*

*Mountains in the far distance cracked in half and crumbled to pieces, causing Tarlea to gasp with widening eyes.*

Amy: "W-What's happening?!" *She watched a massive amount of land slowly rise into the sky.*

Tarlea: (The divine people?!) "It is happening-"

-

Ridley: "W-What-?!" *He shouted as ruins caved down around him.*

Twenty-Six: "S-Sir-?!" *He shouted in shock, as a large pillar collapsed on top of him.*

Twenty-Nine: "Twenty-six!-" *She screamed in shock, as the ground burst open underneath her.*

Ridley: "What is happening-?!" *He grunted to himself and leant to one side, as the floor erupted at an angle.*

Warrior: "C-Consultant-?!" *She shouted in desperation, catching Ridley's attention.*

Ridley: (These are pure-hearted warriors, I do not wish to leave any of them-)

*Human-sized boulders started to rain down around the party, causing Ridley to grit his teeth in desperation.*

Ridley: (I have no choice!-) *He grabbed the two closest warriors out of harm's way, suddenly disappearing in a puff of darkness.*

Warrior: "Captain-?!" *He shouted and watched the swirl of darkness fade into nothing, before falling into a massive gasher.*

-

*A large dirt cloud exploded around the base of the mountain, causing waves in the ocean to violently crash away.*

-

*A woman roughly the same age as Tarlea flashstepped in front of Amy.*

Amy: "E-Eek-" *She stepped back in shock, watching the woman's long black hair sway in the breeze.*

Tarlea: "You're slightly late." *She spoke to the woman, keeping a fixated stare on the rising land.*

?????: *She ignored Tarlea, glancing to each side in a cautious manner.* "Wasn't the Consultant tracking you?"

Tarlea: "Yes-"

Amy: *She awkwardly smiled, regaining her composure from the previous tremor.* "M-Madora!"

Madora: "And my little mighty temper!" *She smiled back, quickly looking back to Tarlea in a serious manner.*

Tarlea: "Due to the Consultant's presence.. The Wise have seriously decided to approve of such an action-?"

Madora: "He was in the city a moment ago, surely they wouldn't be rising it with him in it."

Tarlea: "I am not entirely sure-"

Madora: "Deary?"

Tarlea: "It's plausible they'd want to crush him in its process?"

Madora: "Despite being a Consultant, The Wise still have their moral codes."

Tarlea: "You're right-" *She watched the land rise above the clouds, suddenly fading out of sight.* "And thank you, Madora."

Madora: "That's okay, my dear." *She slowly exhaled and looked at Amy who was filled with uncertainty.* "It's okay." *She smiled in a reassuring manner, placing her hand on Amy's shoulder.*

Tarlea: "Whatever happens to me, promise me you will look after the promised three?" *She turned around, looking at Madora.* (My lovely children.)

Madora: "I will." (By the prophecies, I've been told about your demise, Tarlea.. I saw a mirror-like prison, then, I heard waterfalls on every side.) *She slightly frowned in thought, due to the knowledge she knew.* (Troubling enough, I can't tell you or the consequences will impact innocent people.)

Tarlea: "Please be careful with her, she cannot use Remenistal and neither possesses the power of Neurons or Astragons to effectively use Rosterology items."

Amy: *She glanced at Tarlea and looked confused, whimpering in silence.* (I don't understand what anything means when mummy talks like that.)

Madora: "I see." *She nodded and stepped forward, placing her hand on Amy's head.* "You will need to go, they may need your assistance."

Tarlea: "Indeed-" *She focused her attention back to the distance, shaking her head in disbelief.*

Madora: "Tarlea?"

Tarlea: "The power of Neurons, Astragons, and Radiatons are overpowering everything."

Madora: *She looked past Tarlea and gasped with widening eyes, noticing clusters of sparkling white light, orbs of light and streams of warped air.* "They're all visible."

Tarlea: (The rising of Valhalla must require that much power for them to be all in physical form.)

Amy: "I-I've never seen such a Rasticsplash before." *She spoke in fake-like amazement, trying to include herself in the conversation.*

Tarlea: "No, honey. We call that Roharnia."

PKMY: (And to think, I was dumb as shit, too-)

Madora: *She looked at Tarlea, nodding her head in response.* (The Consultant.) "It's amazing how just one person can cause so much trouble."

Tarlea: "The Consultant who questions my loyalty took advantage of Kath's yellow-eyed condition. Then Millard disappears, and the whole nature of the warrior system changes-"

Amy: "Mother?" *Her soft voice caused Tarlea to bend down, looking at her with emotion.*

Tarlea: *She smiled and held Amy's cheeks, kissing her on the forehead.* "Don't ever forget me?"

Amy: "Won't I see you again?"

Madora: *She noticed their intense faces, causing her to turn around for respect.* (We just had our time of peace, I long for the day when that will return.)

Tarlea: "I'm sure you will, Amy."

Amy: "When will I see you?"

Madora: "..."

Tarlea: *She brushed Amy's arms, removing the wrinkles in her dress.* (You won't for a while, I will be too busy-)

Amy: "Mummy?"

Tarlea: *She looked past Amy, staring into space.* (Considering the plans to defeat the Consultant draws near-.. I also need to train Terra, as she'll be taking my position once I help your father with The Wise...-)

*Tarlea snapped out of her thought, looking at Amy in the eyes.*

Madora: *She slowly exhaled through her nose and tilted her head up.* (Tarlea is having a lot to process right now.)

Tarlea: (I don't want to leave you like this, but performing the strongest known Remenistal takes a lot of preparation.. Seraphic Gate....)

Madora: "Your mother is the number one ranking warrior, you must understand the duties and responsibilities she holds?" *She remained facing away, as she spoke with a serious tone.*

Amy: "..."

Madora: "Tarlea... I'll see you soon." *She implied for Tarlea to expedite her farewells.*

Tarlea: *She looked up, staring at Madora's back.* "Yes, I hear you loud and clear. Thank you."

Madora: "Hmph." *She grumbled, nodding her head in understanding.*

Tarlea: *She focused her attention back to Amy, brushing her red hair behind her ear.* (Falling in love with a member of The Wise, it's near impossible of him to leave Valhalla.)

Amy: "Mummy?"

Tarlea: *She smiled with motherly love and stood up, regretfully turning away.* (I'll miss you-)

Amy: "Mummy-?"

Tarlea: "..." *She stepped forward, flashstepping out of the area.*

Amy: "Mummy?!" *She gasped and screamed at the top of her lungs, reaching out into the air.*

--

PKMY: *She vaguely remembered glimpses of Tarlea's smile.* (That was the first time I saw mummy smile.. And until recently, the last time too.)

--

Madora: *She approached the nearby village and stopped, causing Amy to bump into her.* (What is that?)

Amy: "Madora-?" *She looked in front, noticing the air blur in confusion.*

*A woman dropped buckets of water and struggled to breathe.*

Woman: "H-Heavy-"

Madora: *She scanned the area, noticing the villagers collapse on the spot.* (One by one?)

Amy: "The air feels thick.. Mador.. Ra." *She mumbled under her breath and fell forward, losing consciousness.*

Madora: *She squinted her eyes with annoyance and looked into the distance, watching chunks of land continue to rise into the sky.* (The sheer power of energy is causing people to fall unconscious.)

*Madora bent down and gently picked Amy up, carrying her to the village with ease.*

Madora: (You need your rest.)

-

Ridley: *He lay on the ground with two unconscious warriors around him, slowly regaining consciousness.* "Ah-?"

*Ridley leant up with a grunt, placing his hand on his head in disorientation.*

Ridley: "What was that? Why did the entire area collapse into itself, and what was that unknown force pushing us out-?"

*Shadows on the ground caught Ridley's attention, causing him to look up with widening eyes.*

Ridley: "F-Floating?!"

-

*Several villagers mumbled in confusion, as they slowly regained consciousness, causing the backwater village to sound more lively.*

Amy: *She moaned and slowly woke up, finding herself on a bed inside a small wooden room.* "Where, where am I?"

Madora: *Her voice whispered in the wind.* "I'm sorry, Amy, it seems I'm needed urgently."

Amy: "Mad-Madora?" *She slightly leant up, looking around in a daze-like state.*

--

PKMY: "I remember..." (The room was small and confined. Everything was made of wood and had no bright colours... The wood on the walls were damp and were cold to the touch..)

*PKMY subconsciously scratched the bark on the tree, grunting in recollection.*

--

Amy: *She shivered, drawing her attention to white sheets flapping in the breeze.* (Cold-)

--

PKMY: (That stupid bitch had a torn up, dirty rag of a sheet and-) *She gritted her teeth with emotion, looking back up to the swaying tree branches.* (-Using it as a curtain for a window!)

--

Amy: *She shivered again and inspected the windowless window, scratching sleep out of her eyes.* (Who puts a bed just under a window?)

*Knocks were heard on the door, catching Amy's attention.*

Amy: "Come in?"

?????: *A woman in feral dirty clothes stamped in, hissing in response.* "About time you woke up."

Amy: "Who are you?" *She unintentionally leant back, looking at the woman intimidated.*

?????: "Call me, Hilton."

Amy: "OK, hello Hilt-"

Hilton: "So it seems you're an orphan now? I heard you were of royalty-"

Amy: "Yes-"

Hilton: "Don't expect anything special here, girl."

Amy: *She rubbed the back of her neck in pain, causing her to feel the pillow behind her.* "Umm-"

Hilton: "What is it?!" *She grunted with annoyance and leant forward, frowning at Amy.*

Amy: "Hilton, there are rocks in my pillow-"

Hilton: "You want me to help you? Is that what you're trying to tell me?!" *She hissed in disgust, glancing at the pillow.*

Amy: *She nervously rubbed her arms, slowly nodding her head.* "Umm, yes?"

Hilton: "Like I said-" *She glared at Amy and spat in her general direction, slowly turning around.*

Amy: "...!-"

Hilton: "-Don't expect to be treated like a little princess here, you bitch." *She hissed with a smile and walked out, slamming the door behind her.*

Amy: *She sat on the bed with a dropping jaw in shock, taking the time to register what happened.* (What happened? Why am I here? Where did Madora go?)

--

PKMY: (Believe it or not, I was a little princess like Alicia. I know, you're laughing too, right? After a few months, I got used to the life of being trash.)

--

Amy: *She filled buckets of water from a nearby lake, looking to her side at a small boy with red, amber-coloured hair.* "We're getting better at this."

Boy: "Aha, yeah." *He giggled in a feminine manner, listening to the turning sounds of the village's windmill.*

Amy: "I used to hate going through the forest to get to the water, but now I find it quiet and peaceful."

Boy: "Ah ha! I like it 'cause it's hidden in the forest behind the village." *He spoke with a high and fragile voice while leaning forward to fill another bucket up.*

Amy: *She watched the boy scoop the bucket in the water, noticing cuts on his arm.* "How's your scratch, Blake?"

Blake: "I-It hurts, but it's getting better, fufu."

Amy: *She smiled and nodded her head.* "Good."

Blake: "They didn't hurt me as much as they usually do."

Amy: *She smiled with concern.* (I hate how they pick on him because he's not as boisterous as them.)

Blake: "Umm, we'll play again soon when-"

*A man's deep voice yelled in the background, causing Blake to whimper in fear.*

Blake: "I-I better go." *He smiled Amy off and picked up the buckets.*

Amy: "Yeah." *She stood up and held a bucket in each hand, watching Blake walk in the opposite direction towards an old wooden house.* (Having these buckets filled with water makes them very heavy.)

--

PKMY: "Tssk-" *She stared at the miniature bridge and frowned in recollection, triggering more vivid flashbacks.* (I understand kids should know their place, but authority figures should also show a level of humility.)

--

*Amy walked into the village with an awkward face and stumbled across a miniature bridge, making struggling sounds.*

Amy: "These are really heavy."

Hilton: *She leaned against the house, staring at Amy in a lazy manner.* "Hurry it up, you little bitch! Don't you want to cook soup for dinner tonight? Is that what you're trying to tell me?!"

Amy: "No ma'am!" *She shuffled faster and spilt some water.*

Hilton: *She walked up to Amy and violently pulled her hair, causing her to spill more water.* "Watch your feet, you clumsy dumb filth. Now, hurry it up! I want dinner ready in two hours!"

Amy: (My hair-) *She dropped one of the buckets and rubbed her head in pain with watering eyes, watching Hilton walk away.*

Hilton: (Stupid, dirty lamp.) *She stamped over wooden logs which acted as stairs and walked inside her house.*

Amy: (Dirty lamp?!) *She gasped in shock as if she wasn't expecting to hear a voice.*

*Amy looked down and noticed the buckets near empty, causing her to turn around in a weary manner.*

Amy: (In the palace.. I took all the good things there for granted..) *She sighed in sadness and paused, mentally preparing herself to make her way back to the small lake.*

PKMY: (What I learnt from that day was, always be grateful for the good things you've got. Learning that at the age of fourteen was really helpful in my future experiences.)

*As Amy made her way through the eerie forest, she suddenly heard laughter, which instantly caught her attention.*

Amy: (Someone's laughing?) *She thought in shock and held the buckets in one hand, facing the sounds of the laughter.*

*Amy scrunched her dress near the knees, causing the material to slightly lift up, revealing her feet.*

Amy: (I haven't heard laughter around here at all..) *She whispered with a mixture of interest and curiosity and started to run towards the laughter, causing the wooden buckets to bang against each other.*

--

PKMY: *She looked across her shoulders and down to her feet, observing dirt-like graze marks on her skin.* "Heh-" (I used to hate getting dirty, so I'd even lift my dress up to not get the dirt on the bottom.)

*PKMY purposely rubbed her hands in the dirt and paused, shaking her head at herself with a smirk.*

--

Amy: *She jogged on her toes through the forest, ignoring her surroundings.* (It came from here-)

*Amy almost fell forward and stopped to catch her breath, noticing someone near the lake.*

Amy: "Who-?"

*A young man danced near the lake and noticed Amy in the corner of his eye, causing him to awkwardly stop.*

Amy: "Eek-" *She quickly stepped back with growing shyness and shuffled behind a tree, looking down to the ground.*

?????: "Who's there?!" *He faced the tree, bending his knees in a battle-ready pose.*

Amy: "I-I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you." *She nervously leant to the side, revealing only her eyes.*

?????: "W-Who are you?" *He sounded cautious, keeping his battle stance.*

Amy: "I'm Amy." *She nervously giggled, swaying the buckets by her side.* "What's your name?"

?????: *He straightened up and smiled, relaxing to Amy's presence.* "My name is Purge."

Amy: "It's nice to meet you." *She smiled and leant forward against the tree.*

Purge: "So-"

Amy: "So?"

Purge: "You going to come out from there? Haha."

Amy: "S-Sorry." *She nervously staggered to the side and held the buckets in front of her, taking quick glances to observe Purge.*

--

PKMY: "Purge." *She felt the smooth tree underneath the bark she unintentionally picked off.* (The only guy I've ever met who looked good in loose leather.)

--

Purge: *He nervously scratched his arm, observing Amy in wonder.* "You seem upset? Do you want me to do something spectacular to try and get a smile on that face?"

Amy: "On my face?" *She looked shocked, touching her nose in confusion.*

Purge: "Yeah, you know, smiling and whatnot?" *He awkwardly chuckled, rubbing the back of his head.*

Amy: (He's strange.)

Purge: *He looked uncomfortable, causing him to look around for something to say.* "So.."

Amy: "Yes?"

Purge: *He closely observed Amy, noticing the buckets.* "Oh? Are you getting water?"

Amy: *She looked at the buckets and lifted them up, causing her to spill the remaining water.* "Yes, I need it for dinner."

Purge: "Let me help you."

Amy: *She watched Purge walk up to her, causing her to shake her head in response.* "You d-don't have to-"

Purge: *He grabbed the buckets and faced the lake.* "I haven't seen you around."

Amy: "..."

Purge: "You must be the girl Blake talks about." *He smiled and walked towards the lake, bending down to one knee.*

Amy: "O-Oh, you know Blake?" *She watched him fill the buckets up with water.*

Purge: *He stood up, watching the water gently ripple away.* "Yes I do, he's a good-hearted kid."

Amy: "He definitely is. How do you know him?"

Purge: "He's my stepbrother."

Amy: "He's a good friend of mine."

Purge: "I heard how you protect him when he gets bullied." *He faced Amy and carried the buckets on each side with ease.* "I've been meaning to thank you for some time."

Amy: *She smiled at Purge's help and stood by his side.* "He's a nice boy and he's really funny."

Purge: *He nodded his head and wobbled the buckets, implying to leave.* "Let's go."

Amy: "S-Sure, thank you." *She slightly bowed in appreciation and started to walk forward, causing Purge to follow.*

Purge: "You're not from around here, are you?"

Amy: "What makes you say that?"

Purge: "The way you talk and look."

Amy: "Th-The way I look?" *She gasped and looked down to see what was wrong with her.*

Purge: "N-No, you're the first person I've met who's really easy on the eyes."

Amy: "S-Sorry?"

Purge: "Ah-" *He looked down in embarrassment, ensuring he didn't spill any water.*

Amy: *She slightly smirked, as she realised what Purge meant.* "Umm, the way I talk?"

Purge: *He coughed to clear his throat and awkwardly chuckled.* "You don't talk like the people in this village or neighbouring villages for that matter."

Amy: "Oh, I come from a palace."

Purge: "Really?! What are you doing here then?" *He spoke in amazement, giving Amy all his attention.*

Amy: "My mother had to leave."

Purge: "Why?" *He walked around a thick tree, quickly focusing back on Amy.*

Amy: "She was needed somewhere else."

Purge: "And what about your father?"

Amy: *She looked through the gaps in the forest, noticing the village in the distance.* "He's a noble, I don't get to see him much."

Purge: "I'm sorry to hear that." *He looked down to the ground.*

Amy: "It's alrigh-"

Hilton: "Amy!?" *Her screams echoed, catching Amy's attention.*

Purge: *He pulled an awkward face in response.* "She sounds charming."

Amy: "Hehe, I better go."

Purge: "Oh, y-yeah." *He stuttered in disappointment and carefully handed the buckets to Amy.*

Amy: "I thank you."

Purge: "I will see you around." *He smiled, watching Amy worry about Hilton.*

Amy: "Umm.. OK, bye." *She turned away and carefully ran out of the forest without spilling the water.*

Purge: *He watched Amy leave his sight, causing him to smile in thought.* (Wow, she's different?) *He slowly turned around and started to walk away.*

PKMY: "I was so nervous... I don't know why.."

*Amy walked into the village and noticed Hilton and several other villagers scattered around, trying to find her.*

Hilton: *She heard the buckets hit each other, instantly drawing her attention to Amy.* "You stupid dumb dirty lamp of a girl! Get back here right now!"

*Hilton violently face palmed in disgust, focusing her attention to the villagers who assisted her.*

Hilton: "Thank you for helping." *She watched the villagers nod their heads in response, before walking off.*

Amy: "I was just filling the buckets up with-"

Hilton: *She stormed up to Amy and slapped her across the face.* "You're making dinner, and going straight to bed!"

Amy: (Right away?) *Her stomach growled.* "Am I having dinner?"

Hilton: "Unlikely."

Amy: "But, I'm hungry." *She whimpered, trying not to cry or show emotion.*

Hilton: "Are you trying to say I care? Is that what you're trying to tell me?"

Amy: "Ye-"

*Hilton bent forward and pinched Amy's fingers, causing her to drop the buckets.*

Hilton: *She quickly grabbed Amy by the hair and turned around, dragging her towards the house.* (Stupid girl.)

--

PKMY: *She raised her hand, looking at her palm in thought.* (Besides the following nights to come, I made sure nobody ever treated me like that again. If it meant that I was hardly liked, called a tomboy or my sexuality being questioned, so be it!)

--

Amy: *Her feet scraped along the wooden floor, squirming to each side in pain.* "You're h-hurting me-"

Hilton: *She violently threw Amy onto the bed and faced the door, quickly flicking strands of red hair out of her fingertips.* "By sunrise, I'm leaving for a meeting. When I come back and find out you made a fuss, I will hurt you. Do you understand?"

Amy: *She eagerly nodded her head, afraid to say anything.* "..."

Hilton: "What?!"

Amy: "Y-Yes!" *She quickly crawled to the middle of the bed and placed her head in her lap, while tightly hugging her legs.*

Hilton: "Hmph." *She raised her nose in the air and stormed forward, slamming the door behind her.*

Amy: "...-"

Hilton: "Why did I agree to take that girl in?"

Amy: *She listened to the sounds of the door locking, followed by footsteps creaking away.* (This is horrible!)

*Amy lay on her side and curled herself into a tiny ball, staring out of the window.*

Amy: (Mummy, I miss you, and the palace.) *She shivered in distraught, slowly falling to sleep.*

--

PKMY: (When I think about it, Valhalla reminds me of the palace I used to live in when I was younger.) *She thought to herself and shook her head, quickly dismissing the thought.* (Those were terrible nights, but thankfully they lightened up.)

--

*Birds chirped in the morning light, slowly waking Amy up.*

Amy: *She yawned and stretched, staring at the wall with a bored expression.* (Hmm, it's quiet?)

*Amy suddenly gasped with realisation and smiled, looking to her side.*

Amy: (Hilton isn't here!) *She hopped out of bed and grabbed a long faded pink dress, quickly putting it on in a child-like manner.*

PKMY: (The cleanest thing I owned was that same dress I wore the last time I saw mummy..)

*Birds continued to chirp and a warm breeze blew through the windowless window.*

Amy: *She shuffled to the door, reaching out with uncertainty.* (I hope she didn't forget to unlock the door again.) *She opened the door and sighed in relief, walking out of the room.*

*Amy stepped outside and noticed a group of villagers surrounding a young girl who appeared frightened.*

Villager: "This dirty bitch."

Old Man: "Chris." *He spoke in a stern manner and looked at the man, cueing him to be quiet.*

Chris: "..."

Old Man: *He focused his attention on the girl, sighing with disappointment.* "Imogen, how could you possibly take a loaf of bread?"

Imogen: "It wasn't me." *She whimpered, pushing herself off the wet dirt.* "It was gone when I woke up."

Chris: "I saw her, let's execute her." *He smirked, discreetly licking his lips in anger.*

Old Man: "Chris, no."

Chris: "Why? The dirty thing stole it." *He pointed down to Imogen, causing the other villagers to talk amongst themselves.*

Amy: *She took a deep breath and walked up to the old man, catching his attention.* "If food was stolen then it was a Scoldrant."

*The villagers gasped and stared at Amy with shock as if they weren't expecting a child to speak up.*

Old Man: "A Scoldrant you say?" *He looked up and thought to himself, causing him to nod his head with a smile.*

Chris: *He listened to villagers whisper in agreement, talking about sightings of a Scoldrant.* (A Scoldrant? Really?!) *He frowned, gritting his teeth in annoyance.*

Old Man: "That settles it. Imogen is free to go."

Imogen: *She gasped, looking around in happiness.* "..."

Chris: "But-" *He stepped forward in disagreement and watched the villagers walk away one by one, causing him not to bother.*

Old Man: (Chris, he's been acting strange lately. I will talk to him soon when this Scoldrant ordeal has been sorted out.)

Chris: *He glanced at Imogen and Amy in disgust and walked away, tightening his fists.* (That filthy bitch. I wanted to see her killed, but now I can't.)

Imogen: *She walked up to Amy and hugged her with a widening smile.* "Thank you so much."

Amy: "Hehe, that's OK."

Imogen: "My name is Imogen, what's yours?"

Amy: "It's Amy, it's a pleasure to meet your acquaintance."

Imogen: "Wow, you speak so formal. And, you sound like such a-" *She stepped back and looked up, thinking of a correct word to use.* "-Like a princess."

Amy: "A princess-?" *She smiled in modesty, causing Imogen to eagerly nod her head.*

Imogen: "I mean it." *She smiled, staring at Amy in amazement.*

Amy: "It feels like I'm new here myself, but I haven't seen you around before?"

Imogen: "I'm in this orphanage because my parents lost their fortune, so we're here temporarily to work our way into Silver Wind Island."

Amy: "Temporarily? Hehe, that sounds good." *She looked down to her bare feet, mumbling as if she wanted to say something.* "Umm..?"

Imogen: "Yes?" *She leant forward with innocent curiosity.*

Amy: "I was wondering, did you take it?"

Imogen: *She looked at Amy in a serious manner, shaking her head.* "No, I didn't. I woke up and the bread was gone."

Amy: *She nodded her head and gently brushed her hair behind her ears.* (Hmm, but why would someone take a loaf of bread?)

*Two boys spun in circles in a playful manner and noticed Chris angrily storming towards them.*

Chris: "Stupid girls..." *He mumbled with an angered glare, causing the children to quickly separate and move out of his way.*

*The boys turned around and watched Chris rush back into his house, slamming the door behind him.*

Chris: *He sat on a chair and stared at the loaf of bread on the table.* (What's next?) *He grunted in thought.*

Amy: "Why was that man so angry at you?"

Imogen: "Chris? I don't know. He frightens me. I think he might like me?"

Amy: "Eww, isn't he like thirty years old?" *She scrunched her face in disgust.*

Imogen: "Heh." *She giggled, punching Amy on the shoulder.*

Amy: *She rubbed her shoulder, looking at Imogen surprised.* "W-What was that for?"

Imogen: *She looked confused, awkwardly chuckling in response.* "Eh? It was a joke?"

Amy: "Joke?"

Imogen: "You silly girl." *She smiled, gently punching Amy on the shoulder again.*

Amy: "OK?" *She smiled in confusion, brushing dirt off her dress.*

Imogen: "Hey, let's go to my house. My stepmother isn't home."

Amy: *She smiled, eagerly nodding her head in acceptance.* "Yes."

--

PKMY: (Back then, Imogen was the butch-i-est girl I had ever met-)

*PKMY smirked in recollection, punching her hand in a boisterous manner.*

PKMY: (And her alone, apart from Blake, was my only proper female friend I had outside royalty life. We spent several months together until-)

--

*Birds chirped outside causing Amy to wake up with a stretch.*

Amy: *She rolled to the side and jumped out of the bed excited, hopping into the faded pink dress.* (I better hurry-)

*Amy looked down at herself, nodding her head in approval.*

Amy: *She quietly stepped outside and noticed Purge, quickly skipping up to him.* "Oh, hello."

Purge: *He turned around and stuttered, as Amy's presence caused him to smile.* "H-Hey."

Amy: (I'm always happy when I see him.) *She smiled, stepping slightly closer to him.*

Purge: *He slightly frowned, looking at Amy with growing anxiety and stress.* "..."

Amy: *She noticed Purge's worried facial expression, causing her smile to fade.* "W-What's wrong?"

Purge: "Shh." *He placed his hand over her mouth and stepped back, cautiously looking around him.*

Amy: "Purge-?"

Purge: "Come quick." *He started to walk towards the forest, cueing Amy to closely follow.*

Amy: "What's going on?" *She tiptoed over the miniature bridge, curiously staring at his back.*

Purge: "Haven't you noticed all the kids in this village are slowly disappearing one by one?!" *His tone became serious.*

Amy: "It's because they've been transferred to a family? Or they finally made it out of the orphanage?" *She had a flashback of Imogen saying her parents wanted to get into Silver Wind Island.*

Purge: "No.." *He stopped and looked down, forming fists.* "I heard it's because they are killing them."

Amy: "Who-?"

Purge: "The adults!"

Amy: *She stepped back, frowning at the thought.* "That isn't funny."

Purge: "No, I'm serious! Apparently, they're doing it so a Scoldrant doesn't attack the village?"

Amy: "You sound confused?"

Purge: "I don't know what to believe."

Amy: "W-Well." *She looked down to her feet, trying to think about it from a mature perspective.*

Purge: "..." *He silently held Amy's hand, leading her into the forest.*

Amy: (What is Purge saying? Why would he say that?)

*The peaceful, yet eerie forest caused them to feel at comfort.*

Purge: "I like our long talks, talks that last all day." *He hinted to do it again, changing the conversation.*

Amy: *She smiled, which caused him to smile.* "Yes."

Purge: "I think, we should definitely talk again."

Amy: "Hehe, yes."

Purge: *He slowly walked through the forest and smiled in happiness, as if he temporarily forgot his problems.* (To the lake where I first lay my eyes on her.)

--

PKMY: (No matter how many times I replay that scene in my head, the conversation always gets me so confused-.. First, he's forewarning me about the danger, then we walk off smiling?)

*PKMY scratched her head in confusion and grunted as if she was continuing her line of thought.*

PKMY: (Later that evening, after spending the entire day talking to each other next to the lake.)

--

*Purge and Amy sat on the ground near the lake, giggling at their warped reflections.*

Purge: "Wow."

Amy: "What is it?"

Purge: *He grabbed her hand and smiled with blushing cheeks.* "I'm glad I met you."

Amy: *She gasped with widening eyes, looking away with red cheeks.* "M-Me too."

Purge: "There's something I want to show you."

Amy: "OK-"

Purge: "If you promise not to tell anybody."

Amy: "I-I won't." *She shook her head, giving Purge her complete honesty.*

Purge: *He smiled and stood up.* "Okay, I'm ready."

Amy: (Ready for what?)

Purge: *He closed his eyes and took deep breaths, readying himself.* "Swift might, at my command, AIR SWIRL"

*A swift breeze skimmed along the water's surface, causing the water to ripple several times.*

Amy: *She instantly stood up in amazement, giggling in disbelief.* "Wow, you can use Rostical!"

PKMY: (It was a pathetic attack, but at the age of sixteen, using Rostical without any training or guidance is pretty amazing.)

Purge: "Rostical?" *He smiled with confusion.*

Amy: (This is the first time I've seen someone use Rostical besides Terra, Caesar, Madora and mummy.) *She awkwardly reached for his hand and pulled him down with her.*

Purge: "Rostical, is that what my ability is called?"

Amy: "Yes." *She giggled at Purge's lack of knowledge.*

Purge: "I can tell you another secret." *He smirked, staring at Amy with excitement.*

Amy: "What?" *She smiled back at him, looking at his face in detail.*

Purge: "I use the winds to give me a boost when I run, that's why I'm really good at sports."

Amy: "Hehe."

Purge: "So, what exactly is Rostical? Can other people use the winds too?"

Amy: "Well, what Rostical is-" *She slowly inhaled and held her breath, preparing to go into a detailed conversation.*

-

Chris: *He woke up with red animal-like eyes.* (Did I just sense Rostical?)

-

*Hilton stood at the entrance of the backwater village with several other women, looking at each other with sad filled faces.*

Woman: "I can't-" *She covered her mouth, staring at the village in shock.*

Hilton: (We only just got back... But it gets worse every time-)

*One of the women started to cry hysterically, causing Hilton to comfort her.*

Hilton: "It's okay."

-

*Amy and Purge giggled on the dirt and ignored the fading light due to the setting sun.*

Purge: *He held Amy in his arms, as she used him as a pillow.* "Rostical, using fire out of nothing."

Amy: "Yes. I've also seen people manipulate the ground as if it were clay."

Purge: "That would be amazing to use." *He chuckled, staring out with amazement.*

Amy: (Huh-?) *She moved out of Purge's arms and looked behind her, staring through the forest.* "Did you hear that?"

Purge: "It's probably that mean woman again. Go-"

Amy: "What?"

Purge: "I don't want you getting in trouble." *He quickly stood up and gently pulled Amy up onto her feet.*

Amy: "I-I." *She whispered, intensely staring into Purge's eyes.*

Purge: "What is it?"

Amy: "You make me happy." *She quickly and nervously wheezed out the words, looking down with blushing cheeks.*

Purge: *He blushed and bit his bottom lip with a modest smirk.* "What about Imogen and Blake?"

Amy: "Umm..."

Purge: *He smiled, staring at Amy in thought.* (I'm happy they're friends. Thanks to Amy, Blake's self-esteem has really helped him out with the bullies.)

Amy: *She looked up in confusion.* "I haven't seen her in the village lately..."

Purge: "And what about Blake?"

Amy: "And Blake makes me happy too."

Purge: "Oh.." *He pretended to be hurt as if Amy's previous compliment didn't mean anything.*

Amy: "But you're... Different."

Purge: "Haha-"

*Faint echoes of male villagers and distressed women could be heard through the forest, catching Amy and Purge's attention.*

Purge: *He looked into the direction of the village, twitching with anxiety.* (All the villagers are definitely there.) "Go."

Amy: "I don't-"

Purge: *He placed a finger on Amy's mouth, causing her to close her eyes.* "I will see you tomorrow morning, just after sunrise."

Amy: "O-OK." *She gently touched his hand and moved his finger away, opening her eyes.*

*Amy and Purge silently stared at each other with tension, unsure what to do.*

Amy: "We've talked longer than this before, why do you want me to go-?"

Purge: "I don't want you to get in trouble, remember?" *His words caused Amy to turn around and face away.*

Amy: "OK-" *She took deep breaths and started to run back to the village with bright red cheeks.* (Purge..)

Purge: (Amy..) *He regretfully sighed, watching Amy run out of his sight once again.*

PKMY: (Wow, I used to just think his name. That's a little embarrassing, who knew me and Alicia were so alike.)

Purge: *He smiled and looked into the lake, sighing in satisfaction.* (I can't believe I showed her my secret...)

*Purge picked up a pebble and threw it into the lake, causing it to ripple.*

Purge: (I wonder what happened to Imogen though?)

*Sounds of owls started to hoot in the forest, drawing Purge's attention to his surroundings.*

Purge: (It's getting dark, and it gets very cold out here after sunset.) *He swayed his hand, causing a gust of wind to blow the tree branches to one side, giving him a clear path to his home.* (And I better help Blake with dinner before he burns it again.)

-

Chris: *He sat on an old wooden rocking chair, keeping a fixated stare on the wall.* (I shouldn't, I wouldn't, I couldn't, but I did..)

*Chris stopped rocking and noticed the villagers walk past his house, listening to their conversation.*

Hilton: *She held onto the woman who cried, stroking her head.* "It's okay."

Woman: *She sniffed and held Hilton's hand, acknowledging her efforts.* "Imogen... I didn't want to."

Hilton: "That's why I tell everyone, do not get attached to the children." *She mumbled in the woman's ear, trying not to cry herself.*

Chris: *He smiled and chuckled evil-like, rocking back in the chair.* (I grow tired of this village.. I will summon him shortly.)

?????: "Happy-?" *A man's voice echoed in the wind, causing Chris to lean forward in shock.*

Chris: "H-Huh?" *He looked around in an anxious manner, slowly shaking his head with dismissal.* "I must be tired..? I should summon-"

*The sheet to Chris' window blew open, causing him to look over his shoulder in fright.*

Chris: *He instinctively held his breath, quickly scanning the area with his eyes.* "Nothing?"

*Chris slowly exhaled and started to relax, watching the curtain sway in the night's breeze.*

Chris: "Maybe I need sleep-?"

?????: "Ahem?"

Chris: *He gasped and stared in front with widening eyes.* (A warrior!?) "You're early."

Warrior: *He listened to the men calm the distress women, causing him to smirk in disgust.* "..."

Chris: *He watched the villagers enter their houses, causing the village to suddenly become quiet.* (They calmed down sooner than expected-)

Warrior: *He coughed, drawing Chris' attention.* "Have you done what we asked?"

Chris: "There are still several kids left."

Warrior: "If you don't want your entire clan wiped out. I highly recommend you do what the Consultants ask."

Chris: "Hmph, fine."

Warrior: "The higher-ups are fighting at the moment." (With this floating land business.) "So we need no interruption from any hero wannabes."

Chris: "...-"

Warrior: "Kill the children, which intimidates the villagers, which gives a sense of authority and so forth.. That's how it works."

Chris: "I know what the plan is." *He spoke in a rude manner as if he didn't want to be lectured.*

Warrior: *His fingers violently twitched, drawing his attention to tattoo-like markings on his hand.* (This Self-inflicting Glyph is hurting me... But I need it to flashstep, otherwise I'm too weak to do so without the power-up.)

Chris: "Is there anything else?" *He mumbled with annoyance.*

Warrior: "I will follow up shortly." *He flashstepped out of the room, causing the sheet to flap open again.*

Chris: (I have no choice, it will need to be done.) *He stood up and sighed, noticing Amy stealthily enter her house.*

--

PKMY: (After a whole year of being there. It was that day, the day I completely changed.)

--

Amy: *She woke up and glanced across the room, noticing it was pitch black.* (Did I wake up too early?) *She leant on the bed and looked out the window, squinting her eyes in confusion.* "How odd?"

*Clouds were incredibly thick, to the point it blocked out the sunlight. Vibrations were constantly felt along the ground and loud bangs echoed like thunder.*

Amy: (It must be a storm..) *She stood up in curiosity and slid into her dress, facing the door.* "Hilton? Did you want me to cook the early feast again?"

*The room was quiet and only the creaks of wood under Amy's feet could be heard inside the house.*

Amy: (She would've responded even if she was asleep. She's definitely not here..?)

*Scratching sounds of timber came from the window, instantly catching Amy's attention.*

Amy: "H-Huh?" *She slowly spun around and noticed Purge attempting to climb over the window.* "Good morning."

*Amy smiled and quickly fixed up her hair, staggering towards him.*

Amy: *She stopped at the window, causing her smile to widen.* "What are you-?"

Purge: *He grabbed Amy's hand and pulled her through the window, waiting for her to stand up straight.* "Run-"

Amy: "It's too early-"

Purge: "Hurry!-" *He whispered under his breath and pulled her arm, running towards the forest.*

Amy: "What's wrong?" *She awkwardly ran behind Purge, as he continued to pull her with urgency.*

Purge: *He ran into the forest which seemed darker than usual and stopped, looking at Amy in a serious manner.* "They plan on killing us!"

Amy: "Why would they?" *She shook her head half asleep as if she didn't believe him.*

Purge: "I've known you for eleven months! Are you saying you don't believe me?"

Amy: "No.. It's-"

Purge: "It's what?" *He started to become upset, causing Amy to take the conversation more seriously.*

Amy: "Why would they kill us for no reason?"

Purge: "I heard a warrior is on their way!-"

Amy: "A warrior-?!" *She gasped under her breath.*
Purge: "-And I'm still not over that rumour about the Scoldrant killing people."

Amy: "On their way, do you mean here?" (And I forgot about that rumour Purge mentioned to me before.)

Purge: "Yes, here!"

Amy: *She scratched under her eyes and became alert.* "I'm sorry, of course, I believe you."

Purge: "Great, let's go-" *He stepped to the side and started to run through the forest, closely followed by Amy.*

Amy: *She increased her running speed to catch up with Purge.* (I've seen Purge serious before, but, he seems almost frightened.)

Purge: (I don't want anything to hurt Amy-) *He noticed Amy and smiled as if his worries disappeared.*

--

PKMY: (Now, despite doing this ourselves, if I saw anyone do this, I'd probably vomit-) *She slowly walked through the orphanage, triggering another flashback.*

--

*Amy and Purge ran with synchronisation and stared into each other's eyes while avoiding the forest's terrain.*

Purge: "If something happens.. I want you to know that I.. Uhh, arr, ahem." *He talked as if he had something in his throat.*

Amy: "Are you OK?" *She subconsciously grabbed his hand and slowed down to a stop.*

Purge: *He slowly inhaled and faced Amy, taking deep breaths due to the run.* (Gee, this is harder than I thought.) "I-I-I.. Like you!" *He unintentionally spoke with a deeper voice, closing his eyes in suspense.*

Amy: "I like you too?" *She sounded confused and stared at Purge, shaking her head as if she didn't understand.*

Purge: "That's not what I-"

Amy: "Are you sure you're OK? Your cheeks are red.. I can feel the heat from here.. I don't think that was from the run-"

Purge: "That's not what I meant!" *He opened his eyes with a sudden burst of confidence, quickly looking away.* "I like, like you."

Amy: *She stepped back with a dropping jaw and took quick breaths, staring at him with blushing cheeks.* (Purge..) "Umm.."

Purge: "It's okay if you don't, I thought you should know. We shouldn't stop, let's keep going." *He turned around and started to run again, trying not to show any emotion.*

Amy: "Mhmhm." *She nodded her head and started to chase after him, discreetly smiling to herself.*

--

PKMY: (He pretended not to be upset, but he failed to hide it.) *She smiled to herself.* (We ran for what felt like hours, and suddenly, we just stopped-)

*PKMY chuckled in recollection as if she was enjoying telling the tale.*

PKMY: (It was like our current troubles temporarily vanished.)

--

*Amy and Purge slowly walked into a small clearing deep inside the forest, comfortably holding hands.*

Amy: *She looked ahead and noticed the lake shimmering in the moon's light.* (It's the lake-)

Purge: *He silently looked at Amy, catching her attention.* "So.. What do you think, about me liking you?"

Amy: *She suddenly pushed herself forward and hugged Purge, causing him to almost fall over.* "Purge.." *She smiled and closed her eyes, embracing him.* "I do too."

Purge: *He embraced Amy in his arms, unintentionally smelling her hair.* "I want us to leave together."

Amy: (Madora told me to never leave the village until she returned.) *She hesitantly paused, regretfully shaking her head.* "I c-can't."

Purge: *He stepped back out of her arms and looked at her as if she had just betrayed him.* "W-Why?"

Amy: "My mummy's close friend told me I'm not allowed to leave without her coming to get me."

Purge: "..." *He became silent, unsure what to say.*

Amy: "It's not that I don't want to, I really do, but-"

Purge: "Stop saying but." *He took a massive step towards her and slowly leant forward.*

Amy: (What are you doing-?)

*Amy naturally closed her eyes and felt his warm breath down her neck.*

Purge: "..."

*They wrapped their arms around each other and became captivated in their first kiss.*

--

PKMY: *She sighed and walked towards the forest.* (Every time I think about this.. It brings up warm feelings, but at the same time, it makes me feel sick.)

*The creaking sounds of the wooden houses became softer, as PKMY walked further away from the village.*

PKMY: *She held onto herself and rubbed her arm, entering the forest.* (Even healed, my body still hurts from the battle with mummy.)

*PKMY observed the familiar forest with nostalgia, triggering vivid scenes of that night.*

PKMY: (I wonder...)

*A strong cold gust of wind blew past PKMY, slightly bending the treetops.*

PKMY: *Her face was red, as she continued to walk through the forest.* (There it is-)

*PKMY confronted a massive tree near the lake and stopped, rubbing her finger across the bark.*

PKMY: "Heh." (It's still there.) *She smiled, gently feeling man-made markings on the bark.*

--

*Purge and Amy slowly tilted their heads away and smiled, taking the time to register their new experience.*

Amy: "Was.. That a kiss?" *Her body trembled, as she slightly leant back in amazement.* (What is this feeling?)

Purge: *He held her hand, chuckling in response.* "Do you still want me to leave alone?"

Amy: *She stood on her toes and kissed him again, leaning back in disagreement.* "No! I will go with you."

Purge: "Despite what your mummy's friend says?"

Amy: "Despite!" *She enthusiastically smiled, sucking on her lips.*

Purge: "I'm happy to hear that." *He smiled in happiness, taking a deep breath.* "O-"

Amy: "P-"
Purge: "-Kay, Amy."

*Amy and Purge paused and pulled strange facial expressions, trying to understand what was said.*

Amy: "Hehe, that sounded funny."

Purge: *He chuckled in agreement, rubbing her arm in a caring manner.* "That didn't sound bad."

Amy: "Back where I used to live, I heard the other girls talking, and..."

Purge: "And?"

Amy: "Their boyfriends gave them nicknames."

Purge: "Boy-friends?" *He spoke under his breath in realisation, causing a smile to consume his face.*

Amy: "Mhmhm." *She nodded her hand, while gently biting her upper lip.*

Purge: (A nickname?) "How about, Pee-okay-Amy?"

Amy: "No." *She stared at him and waited, implying for him to guess again.*

Purge: "Pee-okay-mee?"

Amy: "Nope." *She shook her head in a cute manner, waiting for his next guess.*

Purge: "How about Pee-on-me?"

Amy: "Hehe, eww." *She frowned and shook her head with a smile.*

Purge: "I got it! Pee-kay-me?!"

Amy: "I like-"

Purge: "Nope, my mind is made up-" *He stubbornly looked away, as if he no longer cared for her input.* "Your nickname will be, Pee-kay-me."

Amy: "Hehe, OK."

Purge: "Cool." *He grunted in accomplishment, wrapping his arms around her.*

Amy: (I feel.. Safe.)

*Sounds of moving water could be heard, as the lake's surface rippled from the cool night's breeze.*

Purge: (This is the happiest moment-...) "I want this feeling to last forever."

Amy: "Forever?"

Purge: "Yes." *He looked around and stared at the thickest tree in the vicinity, letting go of Amy.*

Amy: "Purge?" *She looked up with a smile, wondering what his intentions were.*

Purge: "Forever, right?" *He held her hand and gently pulled her forward, slowly walking towards the tree.*

Amy: *She tightened her grip on his hand and stopped in front of the tree, looking at Purge in confusion.* (Forever?) "What exactly are you doing?"

Purge: "I'm going to write our names on this tree."

Amy: "With what?"

Purge: "This-" *He lifted his foot up and took out a butter knife which was concealed in his shoe.* "I keep it for protection."

Amy: "OK." *She rested her head on his shoulder, watching Purge attempt to cut the bark on the tree.*

Purge: *He stuck out his tongue in concentration, struggling to write his name.* (Nearly-)

Amy: *She smiled at his attempt and squinted her eyes, reading the letters he engraved on the tree.* "Purge."

Purge: *He waved his wrist around to relieve the pain and chuckled in a defeated manner.* "Okay, this isn't going to be as easy as I thought. Your nickname is too big, haha."

Amy: "Hehe, why don't you try shortening it?"

Purge: "Shortening it? But-?"

Amy: "I will still know it's me." *She giggled at Purge, swaying to each side in a flattered manner.*

Purge: "You're smart! How about this-?" *He leant forward and stuck out his tongue, cutting the letters PKMY on the tree.*

PKMY: (I don't know what he was going to protect with a butterknife? Maybe spread it? Heh, he was still able to engrave letters in a tree, though.)

Amy: "I like it!" *She reached forward and wiped the sap which dripped under the letters.*

Purge: "Cool. You are to use those letters as your name." *He joked around, as he admired his work on the tree.*

Amy: "I will!"

Purge: *He looked at Amy in shock, staring at her in amazement.* "You will?"

Amy: "To prove I care for you.. I will use those letters to remember what we have." *She paused and suddenly swayed to the side in a sickly manner.*

Purge: "Amy? You look a little pale-"

Amy: "I-?" *She suddenly swayed forward, dropping to her knees.*

Purge: "W-What's wrong?"

PKMY: "I don't know?" (It must be something to do with the Neurons or, I don't know, whatever mummy always talks about?) *She had a flashback of falling unconscious in front of Madora.*

Purge: "Here-" *He pulled her up onto her feet and held her, as he started to walk back to the village.*

PKMY: "Where-?"

Purge: "I think it's for the best if you restore some of your stamina."

PKMY: "I think you're right-" *She looked down, noticing her toes scrape with each step.* "Purge, I can't walk properly-"

*Before PKMY finished her sentence, Purge bent forward and carried her on his back.*

Purge: "The plan is to take it easy, get some rest, gather our belongings and we'll leave tomorrow, for good."

PKMY: "Y-Yes." *She spoke under her breath, nodding her head in exhaustion.*

Purge: (.. Blast! I kind of wanted to go now-) *He looked over his shoulder, glancing at PKMY in concern.* (But there's no way we could've gone tonight, even I'm pretty tired myself.)

--

PKMY: *She slowly exhaled, staring at the old appearing markings on the tree.* "Purge and PKMY."

*PKMY looked up and loudly sighed, suddenly gritting her teeth in frustration.*

PKMY: "Purge... You idiot!" *She shouted and punched the tree, causing leaves to spiral down.*

--

Purge: *He carefully helped PKMY through the window, glancing to each side in confusion.* "There-"

PKMY: *She lay on the bed and looked at Purge, smiling in appreciation.* (When I think about it, I haven't slept very well, that's probably why I got so weak-)

Purge: "I don't know why Hilton isn't here, but, I better go. Knowing my luck she will return just as I leave."

PKMY: "Hehe." *She smiled in understanding and nodded her head as if she didn't want Purge to go.*

Purge: *He looked up, staring at the clouds in confusion.* "We'll leave as soon as the sun rises."

PKMY: "Why so early?"

Purge: "Even though it's dark, it's still the middle of the day. So please make sure you get plenty of rest before we go." *He smiled and looked behind him, readying himself to leave.*

PKMY: "Excuse me, mister." *She made herself comfortable, pulling the blankets up to her neck.*

Purge: "Yes?"

PKMY: *She looked up to her forehead.* "Ahem?"

Purge: *He smiled and jumped inside.* "You're not obvious, are you?"

PKMY: "Hehe."

Purge: *He leant over the bed and rolled his eyes in a playful manner, kissing PKMY on the forehead.* "High maintenance."

*A loud bang came from outside, causing Purge to step back in shock.*

Purge: (I should get out of the house-) *He turned around and jumped through the window.*

PKMY: (That came from the front of the house, Hilton?)

Purge: "Pss-t." *He popped his head through the window and looked at PKMY.* "Goodbye." *He smiled and left immediately without waiting for PKMY's response.*

PKMY: "..." *She smiled and rolled to the side, quickly falling asleep.*

--

*Flower petals glided and swirled over the ocean, as the waves shimmered in the sun's light.*

PKMY: *She flashstepped into a field of flowers, listening to waves crash against the cliff in the distance.* (Here.) *She coughed, tightening her fists with emotion.*

*A warm gust of flower petals blew across the field, causing PKMY to frown in recollection.*

PKMY: (This stupid field, meadow, wateva it is.)

*PKMY walked over towards the cliff and looked down, watching the waves crash against the rocks.*

PKMY: (Wait a minute-) *She stared out into the ocean, squinting her eyes in a curious manner.* (Is that where one of The Unknown Territories Alicia and what's his face entered?)

--

Purge: *He leant on the windowless window, watching PKMY sleep in her bed.* "AIR SWIRL"

*A gust of wind blew the sheets off PKMY, causing her to gasp in fright from her deep sleep.*

PKMY: *She looked over to the window, instantly noticing Purge.* "Y-You scared me."

Purge: "Sorry. Are you feeling better?" *He spoke with urgency and glanced to each side, ensuring nobody could see him.*

PKMY: "Yes-"

Purge: "Let's go." *He leant over the window and reached for PKMY, twiddling his fingers.*

PKMY: "Why? Is it already time to go?"

Purge: "Chris-"

*Vibrations rumbled across the ground and screams echoed, causing PKMY to throw the sheets off the bed.*

PKMY: *She stood up and grabbed Purge's hand, hopping out of the window.* "What happened?"

Purge: "It must've happened yesterday and we didn't even notice!" *He started to run towards the forest, ignoring his surroundings.*

PKMY: *She looked around and instantly noticed houses burning to the ground.* "What-?"

*PKMY gasped in shock and looked down with widening eyes, staring at several villagers lying motionless in awkward positions.*

PKMY: "What happened?!"

Purge: "It's Chris!" *He stepped over a pool of blood, keeping a determined stare on the forest.*

PKMY: (There are bodies just outside the house!) *She closely followed Purge consumed with fear.*

Purge: "Please ask questions when we get out of the vill-"

*Two houses exploded in fire, causing PKMY to screech in shock.*

Purge: (No-no-no-) *He started to run and glanced over his shoulder, ensuring PKMY was safe.*

PKMY: "How is Chris doing this?!" *She ran after Purge, swaying to each side in a feminine manner.*

Purge: *He reached for PKMY's hand as he continued to run.* "He somehow summoned a Scoldrant."

PKMY: *She looked shocked, grabbing onto Purge's hand.* (What?!)

Purge: "Or, I think that's what it is."

*They entered the forest and a piercing roar echoed, causing them to fill with fear.*

Purge: *His lips quivered in fright, as he tried to hide his fear.* (PKMY's breathing, she must be petrified-)

PKMY: "That sounds so scary." *She spoke under her breath, inhaling deeply and loudly.*

Purge: "Don't worry, I know Rostical. I will protect you." *He ran deeper into the forest and slowed down, allowing PKMY to catch her breath.* "I will protect you with my life."

PKMY: "Purge-" *She shyly smiled and looked back, causing her to focus on her thoughts.* "So, w-what happened?"

Purge: "I was heading home after doing my daily chores.. And Chris walked into the village's centre and started to blabber crazy words."

PKMY: (Crazy words?) *She slightly bent forward, taking deep breaths.*

Purge: "Then suddenly that.. Thing came and started to.." *He paused and frowned in disgust.*

PKMY: "Purge?"

Purge: "It started to kill the villagers, one by one."

PKMY: *She gasped and stepped back, causing a stick to crack under her foot.* "I've never heard of an ability to summon a Scoldrant before."

Purge: "Neither did I."

PKMY: (My mummy knew a lot of things, but she never mentioned something like this before-)

Purge: "Let's go, far away from this place."

PKMY: "Sure! I'll go anywhere with you."

Purge: *He prepared himself to run and noticed PKMY's frail posture.* "Here." *He turned around and bent forward, motioning PKMY to jump on.* "Get on."

PKMY: *She smiled and hopped on his back, causing her long red hair to dangle in Purge's face.* "I-I'm not too heavy, am I?"

Purge: *He stood up straight, causing PKMY's hair to naturally move out of his face.* "Don't be ridiculous." *He placed his hands under her bottom and started to run, listening to owl's hoot and the rustling of leaves.*

PKMY: *She smiled in comfort, trying not to make any unnecessary movements.* "Far away." *She whispered, staring ahead with new hope.*

--

PKMY: (I don't know how long he ran for, but he didn't stop or even slow down.) *She looked down, watching the flowers flow with the wind.*

--

*Purge ran through the forest and looked around, maintaining his running speed.*

Purge: *He inspected the area, mumbling in thought.* (We've passed our lake awhile ago. I don't think I've ever been this far.)

PKMY: "Purge?"

Purge: "Yeah?"

PKMY: "I feel safe with you.. I haven't lied to you and I never will."

Purge: "What is it? What a strange thing to say."

PKMY: "I just wanted to say, I'm really scared." *She looked up and noticed smog caused by the fire, which covered the sky.* (I can't tell if the sun has set or risen yet, the smoke looks thick... Is it really from the village?)

Purge: "I'm glad you feel that way."

PKMY: "Being scared?"

Purge: "No, about not wanting to lie."

PKMY: "Yeah."

Purge: "But, I've already lied to you." *He ran out of the forest and into a field of flowers.*

PKMY: "What?!" *She gasped in shock and instantly hopped off his back, staring at him with growing anger.*

Purge: "Don't be mad-"

PKMY: "What did you lie to me about?!"

Purge: "When I said I liked you."

PKMY: *She covered her mouth and stepped back in disbelief.* "Y-You lied about that?"

Purge: *He nodded his head in a guilty manner.* "I lied-"

PKMY: "H-How could you?" *She turned around and prepared to run away, overwhelmed with emotion.*

Purge: *He quickly grabbed PKMY's arm and pulled her forward, causing her to stare into his eyes.* "I lied because I don't like you.."

PKMY: *She awkwardly shook her head, staring at him with watering eyes.* "I-"

Purge: "It's because I love you."

PKMY: *She looked surprised, silently staring at him with a dropping jaw.* (My throat.) *She quietly stepped forward and hugged him tightly.* (How, what can I-? What do I say?)

Purge: *He smiled and looked down, holding her with comforting arms.* (Don't push yourself. Don't say anything.)

*Another wave of petals blew in the breeze past them, causing PKMY's dress and hair to sway to one side.*

PKMY: "Purge, I-"

?????: "Har-harh!"

PKMY: "Huh?" *She placed a hand on Purge's chest, looking behind her in shock.*

Purge: *He frowned and stepped away from PKMY.* "I thought I ran far from the village?!"

Chris: "I knew I missed people." *He spoke with an opened mouth and stood awkwardly on the spot, covered in blood.*

Purge: "S-Stay back!" *He stepped forward, pushing PKMY behind him.*

Chris: *His eyes glowed an eerie yellow.* "I'm here to kill you!-. Argh." *He bent over in pain and rubbed his head, as a massive wolf-like Scoldrant appeared out of the forest.*

PKMY: *She stared at the house-sized Scoldrant with widening eyes, trembling in fear.* "I-I h-haven't seen something, that b-big before!"

Purge: "It's huge." *He grunted to himself with a worried expression.*

Chris: "Well, it's time to kill you, then my head will feel better. Lulu, kill these people now."

*The giant Scoldrant roared in response and prepared itself to attack.*

Warrior: "I'm sorry, but-"

Chris: "Huh?" *He slowly looked behind him, staring at the darkness in the forest.* "What are you doing here?"

Purge: *He stepped back, holding PKMY close to him.* (Who is he?)

*The warrior walked out from the forest and stepped into the field, glaring at the flowers in disgust.*

Warrior: *He stood next to the Scoldrant which towered over him, discreetly groaning in pain.* (This Self-inflicting Glyph has done more damage to me than expected?) "Sorry, but this experiment was classified as a failure."

Chris: "A failure? Why?! What was an experiment?!"

Lulu: "Grrr." *She looked to the side, growling at the warrior.*

Chris: "It's fine, Lulu." *His words caused her to settle down.*

Warrior: "The Neurons have corrupted you." *He discreetly unsheathed his sword and glared at the Scoldrant in the corner of his eye.*

Chris: "Corrupted?! What?!"

Warrior: (In the ranks, I'm in my early twenties, but this life-threatening glyph has boosted my power to that of a vice-captain!) *He spun around and faced the Scoldrant.* "Failure!" *He threw the sword into Lulu's neck, causing Chris to gasp with widening eyes.*

Chris: "Lulu?!"

Lulu: "Grarh-" *She roared and collapsed onto the ground, causing a pulse of flower petals to blow away.*

Warrior: "Hmph, that was too easy. I thought I was going to have to fight really hard."

PKMY: *She shivered due to the cold and fear.* (That man struck that huge scary Scoldrant with no problems.)

Chris: "You promised if I do this, you wouldn't kill me or anyone from my clan."

*White orbs started to rise from the Scoldrant and Chris, catching Purge's attention.*

Purge: "What's happening to him?!"

PKMY: "Why are the white balls rising from Chris too?" *She seemed more fixated on the white orbs coming from Chris than the white orbs themselves.*

Warrior: *He stared at Chris and chuckled, shaking his head.* "People from the Scoldrant clan?"

Chris: "Scoldrant clan?" *He wheezed and coughed out blood, holding onto his neck.*

Warrior: "Pocket Scoldrants, a band of animals, freaks? I'm sorry, I don't know what you call yourselves, but-"

*The warrior glanced at Purge, focusing his attention back to Chris.*

Warrior: "If you kill a Scoldrant or the Scoldrant User. They both die." *He chuckled in an evil-like manner, glaring at Chris with confidence.*

PKMY: (They both die?)

Purge: *He stared at Chris and noticed his eyes fade, changing from yellow to blue.* (His eyes are back to their normal colour...?)

Chris: *He stared at his companion and fell to the ground, wheezing on his last breath.* "I'm so sorry, Lulu."

Warrior: *He watched Chris and Lulu burst into tiny white orbs, slowly swirling into the air.* "Truth is, the Consultant already found a number one material person to use the black orb experiment on, what was her name? Ruby? Or was it Jewel?" *He mumbled to himself knowing Purge and PKMY could still hear him.*

PKMY: (This is terrible.) *She stepped behind Purge and tightly held his side, discreetly staring at the warrior as if she was hiding.* (I hope the warrior will just leave.)

Purge: "What are you going to do?!" *He bent at the knees and spread his arms in a defensive manner.*

Warrior: *He silently walked to the cluster of fading white orbs and picked up his sword, sheathing it back into its case.* "I'm going to kill you of course."

PKMY: (Kill?!)

Warrior: "About, now?" *He adjusted the strap to the sword around his waist and faced Purge, suddenly charging towards him.*

Purge: *He looked at his hand and faced PKMY, staring at her with a mature expression on his face.* (AIR SWIRL)

*Purge suddenly pushed PKMY off her feet and she flew across the field, causing the warrior to chuckle in confusion.*

PKMY: (No!) *Before she landed, a gust of wind lifted her up, causing her to land safely.*

Warrior: "That's a little rude, hitting a girl." *He pulled out the sword and ran into striking distance, raising it into the air.*

Purge: *He quickly focused his attention back in front and unnaturally swayed to the side, closely avoiding the warrior's strike.* "...-"

Warrior: "How-?" *He grunted in shock and stepped to the side, quickly jabbing forward.* "Hah-"

Purge: *He slapped the sword away, causing a pulse of wind to blow the warrior's body to one side.* "...-"

Warrior: *He quickly regained his composure and adjusted his grip on the sword, taking a more casual approach to Purge.* (Hmm? A Rostical User in an orphanage? Who would've thought-)

Purge: "You look surprised." *He cautiously stepped back, purposely keeping the warrior's attention on him.*

Warrior: "It's not uncommon for people to use Rostical outside the warrior rankings, but it's always a shock."

Purge: "..." *He silently stared at the warrior, as if he needed to use all his concentration on the fight.*

Warrior: "Who would've thought I'd have to use this on children."

Purge: (This-?)

Warrior: "Double Slash." *He jumped forward as his body glowed a shade of blue, slashing Purge at blinding speeds.*

Purge: "Argh-" *The force of the warrior's attack pushed him back.* (Fast!-)

Warrior: *He jumped forward, raising the sword in preparation.* "Triple Slash."

Purge: "No-" *He gasped in shock, instantly noticing blood, running down his arm.* (It felt like the previous attack missed-)

Warrior: "Too late!" *He swayed his shoulders corresponding to his swings, slashing Purge three times at incredible speeds.*

PKMY: (Purge!)

Warrior: (With this Self-inflicting Glyph, I won't lose to children, Rostical Using or not!) "Cloud Cutter." *He flicked the sword, causing a sudden slash to bleed on Purge's cheek.*

Purge: (I can't focus the words with him striking me-)

Warrior: "Can't switch between offensive and defensive? Shame, you inexperienced dirty lamp-"

Purge: "Swift might, at my command, AIR SWIRL" *He pretended to hold a sword and swung his arm downwards, watching sparks scatter off the warrior's armour.*

Warrior: "Wha-?!" *A sharp gust of wind sliced his hand off.* "Argh!"

Purge: "I'm only getting started!"

Warrior: *Purge's surprise attack caused him to stand on the spot in confusion.* "My, hand?" *He looked down, intensely staring at his left hand on the ground.*

Purge: *His knees buckled, as they became weak.* (Using Rostical weakens me, but I won't let him know that.)

Warrior: "How did you use Rostical, you little dirty lamp?! Not even I know it yet!" *The sword wobbled in his hand, as anger filled his body.*

Purge: (Why is he confused now? I thought he knew I could use Rostical-?)

Warrior: "Actually using an incantation boosted-" *He uttered in pain which overcame his anger.* "My hand, the pain, argh!-"

*The warrior fell onto the ground and placed his bleeding arm close to his chest.*

Purge: (It looks like that will stop him from pursuing us, I don't want to kill anyone.) *He turned around and ran up to PKMY, hugging her with growing relief.*

Warrior: "Ougi..." *He muttered under his breath, glaring at Purge's back.*

Purge: "Are you okay?" *He looked at PKMY and smiled, taking a deep breath.*

PKMY: "I'm OK."

Purge: "Good! Now let's go."

PKMY: "You did it." *She spoke in amazement and stepped to the side, readying herself to leave.*

Purge: "See, I told you. I will protect you with my life-" *He stopped in mid-sentence and gasped, looking down with widening eyes.*

PKMY: "What-?" *She gasped, noticing the warrior's sword slither through Purge's chest.*

Purge: *He stared at the sword, watching it warp like a snake.* "How-?"

Warrior: "Slithering Slicer." *He pulled out the sword and stopped moving his wrist, causing the sword's image to revert back to normal.*

Purge: "..." *He looked confused, frozen with shock and disbelief.*

Warrior: "I heard your cute little talks before.." *He chuckled as blood poured out from his arm.* "Since you're in love, why not pierce you through the heart? How ironic."

PKMY: (Is? Is this a nightmare?) *She froze in terror, staring at the blood-drenched sword.*

Purge: *He staggered to each side, trying to stay on his feet.* "Y-You're hand, it was sliced off..?"

Warrior: "Oh, I hope you liked my acting back there. This Self-inflicting Glyph has been burning every part of my body for quite some time. In other words, I can't feel pain right now."

Purge: *He coughed out blood which ran down his chin.* "Ru-" *He gagged and fell to his knees, intensely staring at PKMY in desperation.* "R-Run."

PKMY: *She shook her head with watering eyes.* "N-No!"

Purge: "You have to."

Warrior: "Ha! Isn't this touching-?"

PKMY: "Why do you do this? Don't you realise you ruin people lives?!"

Warrior: "Does it concern you? You're going to die by me, so...?"

Purge: *He pushed her away, purposely blowing a gust of wind in her face.* "Run."

PKMY: *She nodded her head and stepped backwards, causing her to look at her feet in betrayal.* (Why are my legs moving? I don't want to leave his side!)

Warrior: "You're next, little girl."

Purge: "Leave her alone! Please." *He whimpered and collapsed onto the ground, watching flowers sway past his face.*

Warrior: *He looked down, glaring at Purge in disgust.* "You little girl." *He grunted and focused his attention on PKMY, frowning with killing intent.*

Purge: "No.." *He watched the warrior walk past him and towards PKMY.*

Warrior: "I also find red-haired people disgusting." *He groaned, raising the sword to his face.*

PKMY: "Ah." *She tripped on her foot and fell backwards, landing in the swaying flowers.*

Purge: "No!" (Get up, Get up! Get up! Get up!) *A strange wind-like sound soared around him and the nearby flowers sliced into the air.*

Warrior: "Hmm?" *He turned around with an intrigued expression.*

Purge: "I said." *He stood up with rings of petals, which swirled around him.* "Get away from her!" *He groaned, as his face filled with anger.*

PKMY: (Purge?)

Warrior: "No worries." *He casually turned around and started to walk towards Purge.*

Purge: *He ignored rings of petals which pulsed away from him.* (I don't know how I'm still standing.. It feels like I'm holding my breath underwater and if I exhale, I'll drown.)

Warrior: "I'm lacking a killing blow. My Ougi maybe an advanced technique, but it doesn't have that killing edge to it."

Purge: "Swift might, at my command, AIR SWIRL" *A gust of wind blew in front of him towards the warrior.*

Warrior: *He watched the flowers blow into the air, as the piercing wind cut them in its path.* "It's not fast enough." *He moved to the side and avoided the attack, smirking in a taunt-like manner.* "Pathetic."

Purge: "Argh-" *He swayed his arm to the side, causing a screeching gale to blast towards the warrior.* "CYCLONIC WINDS-"

Warrior: *He grunted in shock and stepped forward, flashstepping out of the wind's way.* (Cyclonic Winds, one of our captain's trademark Rostical-)

Purge: *He felt his blood-soaked shirt and sighed, lowering his arms in a defeated manner.* (I couldn't protect you, Amy.. This is what I can do for you.) *He closed his eyes and the air around him warped, radiating a white glow.*

Warrior: "What are you doing? Entertaining me with glittery effects? What a fitting way to die."

Purge: "Defensive winds, swirl and soar, offensive gusts, grand winds blow throughout my spirit, DIVINE TORNADO"

Warrior: "What Rostical is that?!"

*A white tornado swirled around Purge and pulsed, pushing the warrior off his feet.*

Warrior: "What-?!" *He shouted in surprise as he was thrown into the air, listening to his armour violently rattle in the wind.*

Purge: "Arg-garh-" *He gargled blood and looked up without moving his head, watching the warrior fly in a large circle around the wind.*

Warrior: (The wind is powerful but, I don't feel any cuts?) *He slammed into the ground near the forest.*

Purge: (Please-) *He focused his attention on PKMY and staggered towards her as if his intentions were to get the warrior away.* (Please body.. Just a little longer.)

Warrior: *He leant up and took deep breaths, firmly holding onto his sword.* (It wasn't damaging because the Rostical was immature?)

PKMY: "P-Purge." *She stuttered in fear, quickly standing up.*

Warrior: (Even though I don't feel any pain, I don't think my body will last long, I've been losing a lot of blood.) *He stared at the blood around his handless arm.*

PKMY: "P-Purge!" *She shook her head and quickly ran towards him.*

Purge: "..." *He smiled at PKMY and suddenly collapsed to her feet, coughing out more blood.*

PKMY: (I hate this-) "Purge!" *She squealed and dropped to her knees, holding Purge in her arms.*

Purge: "This is f-for, you."

PKMY: "What?!"

Purge: "Some lady told me this." (I think her name was Madora?) *He slowly repositioned himself and sat on his knees, holding onto PKMY's shoulders.*

PKMY: "Please conserve your energy-"

Purge: "Neurons and Astragons activate, the winds give me impenetrable hope, MYSTIC BOOST"

*Purge's body shined white and the aura-like light moved along his arms and into PKMY.*

PKMY: "Ah!" *She screamed in pain, watching the light drain into her body.*

Warrior: *He breathed heavily and stood up, angrily watching sweat drip off his chin.* "Don't take it personally, but I got a one hundred percent mission rate. I need to finish this."

PKMY: *Her eyes glowed and she stood up with confidence.* "Swift might, at my command, AIR SWIRL"

*A gust of wind soared in the distance and struck the warrior from behind, causing a flash of sparks to scatter off his back.*

Warrior: *He violently spun in the air and hit the ground, coughing in shock.* "Such, power and speed!-"

PKMY: *She sniffed and frowned.* "Swift might, at my command, AIR SWIRL" *She bent down on her knees and skimmed the ground with her arm, causing another gust of wind to slice the area she motioned.*

Warrior: "Ah!" *A gust of wind knocked and pushed him up into the air.*

PKMY: "..." *She watched the wind blast his body across the field as she stood up, standing in a battle-ready pose.*

Warrior: "You won't-" *He tumbled through the air and spread his legs, preparing to land.* "Gherh-" *He touched the ground and skidded across the flowers, gagging in anger.*

PKMY: "I don't want to kill you."

Warrior: *He watched sparks suddenly scatter off his metallic boots, causing him to notice the ground was rock.* "Don't want to kill me?"

PKMY: *She nodded her head, grunting with a frown.* "Yes-"

Warrior: "Too bad for you, because I will-" *He grunted with killing intent and jumped forward, slipping on a loose rock.* "Ahhhh!-" *He fell back off the cliff and screamed, falling into the water.*

PKMY: (There was a cliff?) *She gasped in surprise and jumped towards the cliff in one motion.*

*White orbs floated up from the dark ocean, as choppy waves glistened from the surrounding light.*

PKMY: *She stepped back and looked up as the orbs floated high into the air.* "..." *She quickly turned around with worry and fear, running up to Purge.* "Purge!"

Purge: "Heh, did we get him?" *He smiled, as PKMY bent down and held his arms.*

PKMY: *She started to cry, enthusiastically shaking her head.* "Please don't die!"

Purge: "I.. Love you." *His arms became transparent and swayed into white orbs while retaining the shape of his arm.*

PKMY: "I don't want you to die!"

Purge: "..."

PKMY: "Please, I don't want you to die! I don't want you to die! Please, please, I don't want you to die!"

*Purge's arms suddenly burst, causing the white orbs to rise into the air.*

PKMY: "N-No..."

*The wind changed direction and blew at all angles, causing the petals to swirl around PKMY and Purge.*

Purge: "Don't let anyone pick on you.." *He smiled with a weakened voice.*

PKMY: "I won't!"

Purge: "Always stand up for yourself.."

PKMY: "I-I will!"

Purge: *He paused and licked his lips as if he was dehydrated.* "I really do love you..."

PKMY: "I love you too!" *She screamed in pain, as her tears glittered in the floating orb's light.*

Purge: *His face was blank.* "PKMY.."

PKMY: "Y-Yes?!"

Purge: (I can't feel my body.) "I-"

PKMY: "I'm going to get revenge on all warriors. I'm going to kill them all!" *She rocked back and forth in anger.*

Purge: "No!"

PKMY: "What?!" *She paused, looking surprised.*

Purge: "Don't go on a revenge-driven rampage. Don't fill your life with anger. I learnt it myself.. I took revenge on my parents' murderer, and.."

PKMY: "A-And?"

Purge: "Nobody wants to house a murderer.. Even if that man was a killer himself."

PKMY: "Purge.."

Purge: "I was depressed, until I met you." *He spoke under his breath, as tears ran down his face.*

PKMY: *She whimpered, tightly holding onto him.* "I don't want you to go."

Purge: "You're a beautiful girl. Don't let people walk over-" *He stopped in mid-sentence, coughing up more blood.* "-Don't let people walk over you, but don't lose your kindness."

PKMY: "I.. Will..." *She closed her eyes and cried hysterically, unintentionally wiping her tears on Purge's clothes.*

Purge: "You were my light. I gave you my powers... I just want you to be happy.."

PKMY: *She suddenly fell forward, as Purge's body disintegrated into white orbs.* "Purge?!"

*PKMY suddenly paused in disbelief as if she wasn't expecting it to happen.*

PKMY: "Purge!"

*PKMY uncontrollably shook and leant back, screaming at the top of her lungs while crying.*

PKMY: "Purrrrrgggggeeeeee!"

*PKMY wheezed as if she was being strangled and curled up into a tight ball, hysterically crying in the field of flowers.*

--

PKMY: *Tears ran down her face as she silently stared out into the ocean.* (You made me happy.) *She collapsed onto the ground.* (And that was my story... How is one meant to let go, of something that is really important?)

*A gust of petals blew over PKMY's shoulders, causing her to look behind her.*

PKMY: *She stared at the cross in the middle of the field, looking down with quivering lips.* (Purge...)

----------

*Holland flew through the clouds on Destiny's back, scanning the area.*

Holland: "I sense PKMY around here." *He mumbled, closing his eyes.* (Freya, how can I sense her, so well?)

Freya: (It's because the three of us are somehow linked.) *Her voice echoed in Holland's mind.*

Holland: *He felt his stomach and thought to himself with a semi-smirk.* (I've got butterflies.)

Freya: *She lay on solid ground in a pitch black area and sighed.* (I can't wait to see PKMY.) *She thought to herself, as she rested in Holland's inner-self.*

Holland: (I've got my Freya back, and I got this happy feeling-) *He smirked and noticed Destiny start to decline, causing him to gasp in excitement.*

Destiny: (We're almost here.)

Holland: *He looked down, watching the ocean crash along the sides of a cliff.* (Cool scenery.)

----------

PKMY: (After that, I became lonely and shut everyone out. I joined the rankings and fast-tracked my way to the second strongest captain of that generation.. Once you start to slow down the ageing process, years begin to blur..)

*A cold sea breeze wafted past PKMY from behind, causing the flowers to sway around her.*

PKMY: (And, here I am now... I never would've stopped and thought-) *She paused, as a wave of emotion flowed through her body.* (-What have I become-?)

*Destiny elegantly glided down and flapped her wings, landing onto the flowery field.*

PKMY: "H-Huh?" *She turned around without care, due to her emotional state.* "A Scoldrant?" *Her vision was slightly blurred, due to crying.*

Holland: *He hopped off Destiny and stared at PKMY, nervously smiling in confidence.* "I wanted to see you."

Destiny: *She sneezed and withdrew her wings, tightening them against her body.* (She doesn't seem to realise you're standing in front of her?)

Holland: "Thank you." *His words caused Destiny to nod her head in understanding, before disintegrating into nothing.*

PKMY: "See me? Who?"

Holland: *He took several steps closer and looked down, mumbling in a deep voice.* "How about getting up?"

PKMY: "Oh?"

Holland: *He observed PKMY's sad filled face, causing him to frown in thought.* "Umm.."

PKMY: "..."

Holland: "Do you want me to do something, I dunno, spectacular? To try and get a smile on that face.."

PKMY: "On my face?" *She looked shocked and touched her nose, causing her eyes to widen.*

Holland: "Yeah, you know, smiling and whatnot?" *He awkwardly chuckled, trying to boost her morale.*

PKMY: "H-Holly-" *She gasped under her breath and quickly stood up, facing Holland.*

Holland: *He discreetly hid his confusion, as he inspected PKMY's face.* (Are those tears?)

PKMY: "I-" *She shook her head, forming fists.* "I can't express-"

Holland: "If you can't, then don't." *He smiled, shrugging his shoulders as if the answer was obvious.*

PKMY: *She ran into Holland's arms and tucked her head, instantly and heavily starting to cry.* "I've been lonely for too long."

Holland: *He looked unsure what to do, rubbing PKMY's shoulders.* "Don't say anything if it will make you feel awkward."

*PKMY nodded her head in response to Holland's deep voice.*

Holland: *He looked up, smirking in recollection.* "You wouldn't believe what I got up to."

PKMY: *She smiled with sadness and stepped back to face him.* "Oh yeah-?"

Holland: "Herh-?" *He suddenly wheezed and instinctively stepped back in shock, watching a purple glyph rotate in front of his chest.*

PKMY: *She sniffed in confusion, observing the glyph in detail.* "Holly-?"

Freya: "Grarh!-" *She pounced out of the glyph and tackled PKMY across the field, causing flowers to snap into the air.*

PKMY: "H-Huh-?"

Freya: *She held PKMY down with a growing body, opening her jaw.* (Sonic Roar-)

PKMY: *She gasped in realisation and quickly spiralled out of Freya's grip, backflipping away.* "Freya?"

Freya: "Grarh!" *She looked at PKMY and barked out a visible shockwave.*

PKMY: *She swayed to the side and easily avoided the shockwave, watching it explode a tree in the distance.* "... Freya?"

Holland: *He looked surprised.* "Freya!-"

Freya: *She turned around and viciously growled at Holland.* (Don't you dare interfere.)

Holland: *He stepped back in shock, unsure what to say.* (I've never seen her like that.)

PKMY: "Holland, is this a trick-?!"

Freya: *She viciously barked and glared at PKMY, gritting her teeth.* (Don't talk like I'm not here!)

PKMY: "W-What did I do-?"

Freya: (You!)

Holland: (Freya never gave me the impression she was angry at PKMY-)

Freya: (When Holland needed you, you turned your back on him!) *She had glimpses of PKMY flashstepping out from Holland's reach.*

PKMY: "I-I-I.." *She looked shocked as if she forgot that scenario.* "I don't need you to-"

Freya: *She gargled water, slowly raising her snout.* (If you want it to come to this, then so be it!)

PKMY: "Pfft." *She frowned in a defensive manner.*

Freya: (But don't dare deny, not only his feelings, but yours too!-) *She shouted in thought, watching water string on the sides of her mouth.*

PKMY: "What's it to you?!"

Freya: (Gargling Whirlpool.) "Grah!-" *She jumped forward, barking out a vortex of high pressured water.*

PKMY: *She grunted with widening eyes and jumped forward, flipping over the strings of water.* (Where did she obtain this level of power-?!)

Freya: (You left when you were needed the most!)

Holland: *He slightly looked away, as if he could agree with her.* "..."

PKMY: *She landed and slipped on a sudden string of water, causing her to spiral off balance.* "Tssk-"

Freya: (Sonic Roar.) *She quickly barked out a visible shockwave, hitting PKMY back.*

PKMY: *She crossed her arms and frowned, sliding back across the ground.* "Dammit-" *She stopped with a struggle and swayed to the side, causing the ground to burst open.*

Freya: *She momentarily paused, watching flower petals swirl around PKMY.* (She deflected my attack-)

PKMY: *She wiped her mouth with the back of her hand, looking at Freya in seriousness.* "So where do you want to go about this?"

Freya: "Grr?"

PKMY: *She sighed as if she could understand Freya's confusion.* "Tell me straight up what's this about?"

Freya: (You don't deserve him! That's what this is about!)

PKMY: "Eh?" *She closed her eyes and formed a fist.*

Holland: "Freya-"

Freya: "Grrr!" *She violently growled, causing Holland to be quiet.*

Holland: (Freya upset PKMY, I can feel it-)

Freya: *She squinted her eyes in a happy manner and slightly bent her legs, preparing for PKMY's predictable attack.* (Good, she didn't like what I said.)

PKMY: *She opened her eyes in an aggressive manner, suddenly charging towards Freya.* "Harh!" *She raised her arm and formed a fist, readying to hit Freya.*

Freya: (Gargling Whirlpool.) *She tilted her head up and barked out a vortex of water.* "Grah-"

PKMY: *She flashstepped next to Freya and grabbed her ear, preparing to punch her in the side of the head.* "I do deserve him. And it's not your word to say otherwise!"

Freya: (Aerial Pounce.) *She jumped using her hind legs, causing her to spiral forward out of PKMY's grip.* "Grumff."

PKMY: "I will get serious on you." *She spun around and faced Freya, placing both hands behind her waist.* "Don't you ever say I don't deserve him again!"

Freya: *She glared at PKMY then to Holland, slowly shrinking in size.* "..."

PKMY: *She stared at Freya with a fading frown.* "Knowing you wouldn't stand a chance?!"

Freya: "..."

PKMY: "Aren't you gonna say anything?! I do deserve him!"

Freya: (I'm glad, I wanted her to say it.) *She ignored PKMY and thought with an impressed tone, suddenly disintegrating into the air.*

*PKMY paused in confusion, staring in the area where Freya stood.*

PKMY: "Huh?" *She gasped with realisation, glancing at Holland slightly embarrassed.*

Holland: *He awkwardly scratched behind his head, as if he felt responsible.* "I had no idea that would've happened-"

PKMY: *She smirked in recollection and sighed at Freya's actions.* (That stupid Scoldrant planned this entire little thing-)

Holland: *He shook his head and waved his hands, emphasising his innocence.* "Freya, sh-she was excited to see you and and-"

PKMY: "W-Wateva." *She ran up to Holland and grabbed his arm, flashstepping out of the field.*

*Holland and PKMY appeared in a quiet meadow and the faint sounds of the beach could be heard.*

Holland: *He looked around in confusion.* "Huh?"

PKMY: *She observed Holland's body language.* "You seem confused, but not due to the flashstepping?"

Holland: "No, I'm used to being transported now. Are you mad about Freya-?"

PKMY: *She shook her head.* "Holly, thank you for coming for me." *Her words surprised him.*

Holland: "I wanted to-"

PKMY: *She leant forward and gently kissed him.* "Be quiet."

Holland: "Be quiet-?"

Lezard: "Lezard wants to make a quick breaking-the-wall announcement. We're sailing out of PG waters and into the depths of adulthood! If you're squirmy or awkies like me and want to skip past this, do so. It's not as adult as The Rostical Guild's naughty scene, but if you wish to skip it, go to the next chapter, then go back up to the first scene skip you see and read the rest of this chapter! But, if you're a dirty dastardly deviant, please enjoy! Bwarharharh."

PKMY: *She kissed him again and sucked on his upper lip, causing him to be quiet.* "I said be quiet." *She violently ripped off his shirt and ran her fingers along his chest.*

Holland: "What are you doing?" *He pretended not to enjoy it.*

PKMY: "..." *She pushed him down, causing him to fall back onto his bottom.*

Holland: "What-?"

PKMY: "Shh." *Her face filled with desire and concentration, as she swiftly straddled him.*

Holland: *He smirked with slight confusion as if she was playing a joke on him.* "Want me to be quiet-?"

*PKMY passionately kissed him and started to become more enthusiastic with her body motion.*

Holland: *He gently placed his hand on her thigh, rubbing it with his thumb.* "..."

PKMY: *She started to breathe heavily, leaning face to face.* "How do I know, I'm not just another one of your girls?"

Holland: *His eyes were half closed, as he focused his attention on PKMY's face and body.* "Because, I no longer craved this from you."

PKMY: "Eh?" *She continued to kiss him, purposely rocking her body back and forth.*

Holland: "It feels like more-" *He mumbled and brushed his fingers through her hair, as he leant forward to kiss.* (But I won't deny, I've been wanting this for ages.)

PKMY: *She slightly looked down to Holland's legs, biting her lip with a smirk.* "What's-?"

Holland: *He smirked and started to kiss down her neck, gently stroking her skin with his tongue.* "Shh."

PKMY: *She leant back and sighed under her breath, as if she enjoyed his kissing technique.* (Oh my gosh-)

*Holland lifted his knees, causing PKMY to lean back.*

Holland: *He adjusted several straps to PKMY's clothes and slowly undressed her with enthusiasm.* (She's so light, but when she moves, I can feel it so deeply-) *He mumbled in thought with a loss of mental concentration.*

PKMY: *She sighed again and swayed her arms, allowing Holland to take off her clothes.* "Holly-"

Holland: *He admired PKMY's body, inspecting it with his hands.* "You're so smooth-"

PKMY: *She leant forward and gently bit his bottom lip, filling him with excitement.* (I'm getting butterflies, but they aren't butterflies-?)

Holland: "Man..." *He licked his lips in response, watching PKMY undo his pants.*

PKMY: *She loosened his belt, sliding her hand into his pants.* (I kind of wanted this for some time.) *Her cheeks glowed pink, as she breathed through her mouth.*

Holland: (That feels-) *He tilted his head back, slowly exhaling with a smile.*

PKMY: "A-AIR SWIRL" *Her mumbles echoed and a swirl of wind blew around them, catching grass and dirt.*

Holland: *He smirked and leant forward, passionately kissing her.* "Hmm.."

PKMY: *She wrapped her arms around Holland's head, noticing the tornado-like wall of wind.* (No one can see, privacy.)

Holland: *He leant back and noticed the wind, as he moaned with pleasure.* "I'm all yours-"

PKMY: *She placed her free hand on Holland's chest and pushed him back, looking down in amazement.* "W-Wow-"

Holland: *He looked down, staring at what was in PKMY's hands.* "Y-Yeah.." *He smirked in a proud manner, gasping in pleasure.*

PKMY: *She gently ran her finger along his thighs and waited for Holland's reaction, as if she was teasing him.* (Nothing seems to matter right now, I just want this-)

Holland: *He suddenly frowned in determination and grabbed PKMY by the hair, violently spiralling on top of her.* (I've never felt like this, it's like I can't control myself-)

*Holland quickly reached down and leant forward, causing PKMY to shout in pain.*

PKMY: "A-Ah-" *She tightly closed her eyes, leaning back into the grass.*

Holland: "It's so-" *He struggled to push any further, before suddenly sliding forward in pleasure.*

PKMY: (This feeling.. It's even better than fighting!) *She slowly opened her eyes with a dropping jaw, watching Holland lean forward for another kiss.*

Holland: *He passionately kissed PKMY while rocking back and forth, moaning as he focused on their tongues.* (I feel like I'm light-headed, this is amazing-)

PKMY: *She suddenly leant back, wrapping her legs around Holland's waist.* "H-Holly-"

Holland: *He frowned with a pant, admiring PKMY's body.* "You look amazingly hot!"

PKMY: *She took short quick breaths, quickly rolling to her side, riding Holland.* "Yea?" *She spoke under her breath in pleasure, as if it was a chore to speak.*

Holland: "And beautiful." *He rested his head on the ground, smiling in bliss.*

PKMY: *She suddenly leant back while rocking and gasped with widening eyes.* "What is this rushing-?!"

Holland: *He gasped for air and frowned in pleasure, as he moaned with a dropping jaw.* "I feel it, it's-"

*PKMY and Holland moaned and screamed at the same time, expressing the rush of pleasure they were experiencing.*

-

*Holland and PKMY lay on their backs and breathed heavily, staring at the clouds in exhausted and satisfied manners.*

Holland: "You're the first woman I ever talked to after, you know."

PKMY: *She looked to her side and smile, panting in amazement.* "You were on a pilgrimage."

Holland: "You used to be royalty?" *He licked his lips, taking deep, short breaths.*

PKMY: "That's nothing. You encountered a phoenix." *She sounded impressed.*

Holland: "An orphanage? I heard they were bad places for kids." *He sounded shocked.*

PKMY: *She leant up and looked down to Holland.* "Umm."

Holland: "What is it?"

PKMY: "Mummy said I needed to meet someone, but I have no idea how to." *She looked confused, changing the mood of the conversation.*

Holland: (Mummy?) *He leant up and brushed grass off PKMY's back.* "Who? Don't you think she would've told you?"

PKMY: "She said, I need to control my ability, and in her mind she said, look for a woman named Arcadia."

Holland: "Arcadia?"

PKMY: "Yea, it's not a name you often hear." *She spoke with seriousness and smiled at Holland with bright red cheeks.*

Holland: (Where have I heard that name before-?) *An image of Blake's summon caused him to click his fingers in realisation.* "Blake said Arcadia."

PKMY: *She looked shocked and smiled in hope, before suddenly looking away with disappointment.* "You got my hopes up for a moment, you shit." *She punched Holland on the shoulder and stood up, tightening the straps to her clothes.*

Holland: "Huh?"

PKMY: "Even if Blake knows her, he's a hard person to find too."

Holland: *He stood up and stretched, adjusting his garments for comfort.* "Well, I was going to say, Freya would've got her scent, but since your hopes are so low-"

PKMY: *She turned away and folded her arms with an annoyed grin.* "I'm listening."

Holland: *He touched his chest with one hand and his tribe markings with the other, mentally preparing himself.* "Go-" *He punched forward, causing a purple glyph to spiral in front of his chest.* "Freya?!"

Freya: "Ruff." *She glided out of the glyph and flapped her wings, touching the ground beside PKMY.*

PKMY: *She glanced at Freya, hiding her excitement to see her.* "..."

Holland: *He closed his eyes and kissed a materialising yellow orb in his palm.* "Help me out, Destiny!" *He threw the orb into the air, watching a yellow glyph spiral in the air.*

Destiny: *She flew out of the rotating glyph, looking down at the party.* "Meeeheehee."

Freya: *She looked to the side, glancing at Holland.* (Holland?)

Holland: "..." *He looked at Freya, nudging his head to PKMY.*

PKMY: *She faced Freya, awkwardly patting her head.* (Holly said you-)

Freya: (Know Arcadia's scent, I can already track her.) *She sniffed the air, flicking her ears with heightened hearing.*

Destiny: *She landed next to Holland and sneezed, scraping her hooves in the ground.* (Another trip?)

Holland: *He looked at Destiny, running his hand along her nose.* (I get the feeling this will be a long one.)

Destiny: *She stamped her foot in excitement.* (Okay.) *She trotted towards PKMY.*

PKMY: *She looked down to Freya with a surprised face.* (How did you know what I was going to ask?)

Freya: (I can see and hear everything Holland experiences.)

PKMY: "E-Everything?"

Freya: *She stared at PKMY with a blank expression on her face.* "..."

PKMY: "F-Freya?"

Freya: (Things he doesn't want me to see or hear he can shut out, you filthy lady.)

PKMY: *Her eye twitched with embarrassment and anger.* "Who you calling filthy?!" *She gritted and showed her teeth, purposely growing like an animal.*

Freya: (It was obvious what you two-)

PKMY: (Die!) *She lunged towards Freya with bird-like claws, frowning with killing intent.*

Freya: "Herwrooh." *She zigzagged out of PKMY's reach and quickly ran up to Holland, wagging her tail.* (I got the scent!)

Holland: "Great, PKMY?" *He smiled, oblivious to what just happened.* "Or can I call you Amy-?"

PKMY: *She formed a fist, frowning at Freya with a twitching eye.* "Do so and I'll smash your face in, Frollando."

Holland: "Oh." *He sounded disappointed.*

Destiny: *She trotted next to PKMY and leant to one side, allowing her to jump on.*

PKMY: "But, if no one's around, I suppose you could." *She rolled her eyes at Freya and smirked, hopping on Destiny's back.*

Holland: "Right!" *He grinned and straddled Freya, scratching behind her ears.* "Lead the way, Freya."

Freya: "Gruff!" *She howled in agreement, readying herself.*

Holland: *He leant forward in preparation.* "I'm ready."

Freya: "Grooowh!" *She barked with a growing body and flapped her wings, causing dirt to gust away.*

Holland: "Come on, Amy and Destiny!"

PKMY: "Eh?"

Holland: "You two won't be able to keep up us!"

Freya: "Growlith!" *She ran forward and flapped her wings, diving into the air at incredible speeds.*

PKMY: "Oh yeah?!" *She frowned with a smile, forming another fist.*

Destiny: (That was a challenge!) *She spread her wings and flapped once, blasting up high into the air.*

PKMY: *She quickly held onto Destiny neck in fear and squinted her eyes, as her hair rapidly flapped to each side.* (Crap!)

Holland: "Haha." *He looked behind him while keeping a firm grip on Freya, watching Destiny and PKMY slowly approach him.*

PKMY: *She leant to the side and smiled, enjoying the scenery down below.* (This is amazing. Thanks, mummy and thanks Purge. If it weren't for you two, I wouldn't be who I am now.)

Destiny: "Meehehehe."

PKMY: *She looked at Destiny in confusion, causing her to look at Holland.* "Wat's she saying?"

Holland: "She said you shouldn't stare down like that, or you might fall off."

PKMY: "Wateva." *She stared at Holland, as Destiny flew alongside Freya.*

Freya: (Her scent is far, it will be a while.) *Waves of wind blew against her fur.*

Holland: "No worries."

PKMY: *She glanced at Freya.* (It's going to be a while?) *She grunted and rolled her eyes.*

*PKMY, Holland, Freya and Destiny flew into the distance, as they followed the scent to Arcadia.*

Chapter 5: Season's Tale

*A purple flash momentarily lit up a darkened cave, as swirl-like sounds echoed in the area.*

Season: *He stepped off the fading glyph and clicked his fingers, causing a bright red glyph to shine under his feet.* "Turnback Cave, oh how I never wanted to come back here." *His mumbles slightly echoed with his footsteps.*

*Bat-like screeches could be heard deep within the cave.*

Season: *He inspected the cave, triggering images of Ivan, Cyril and Mae's faces to flash in his mind.* (The Purity Emerald I received from that warrior back then.)

*Season walked with a slight limp, recalling the white star-shaped crystal.*

Season: (I diagnosed the Neurons embedded in the crystal, and pinpointed the effects it used to create a Purity Zone.)

*Season stopped at a door-sized entrance and stepped forward, causing rocks to fall off a ledge.*

Season: *He looked down, watching the rocks splash into water.* (I reconstructed the formula it used and created something similar to a vaccine, which I then pumped into my own Neurons.)

*Season sidestepped and shuffled along the cave wall, keeping his focus to his feet.*

Season: (Hence giving me the ability to never have my Rostical sealed or disabled.)

*Light shined from a massive hole in the roof, giving the caved in area visibility.*

Season: (Just being here reminds me of when we were confronted by those hungry Scoldrants.) *He sighed and jumped onto a pile of rock, causing the red glyph under his feet to disintegrate away.*

*Season inspected the area, noticing the water glow a natural green colour which slightly lit up the dark areas the sunlight from the roof didn't.*

Season: *He spun around, noticing peculiar charcoal lines on the rocks.* "Judging by these markings, Cyril must've used his Ougi."

*Shadows of birds moved across the cave floor, as they flew high in the sky.*

Season: *He looked around and continued to inspect the rock formations and markings.* "Everything has been preserved, not many people go here."

*Season became engrossed in the area, as if he was reenacting what happened in his absence.*

Season: "Unless their physical bodies transferred to The Astral Plains, I might as well see if-" *He mumbled to himself and closed his eyes, listening to the sounds of water dripping.* (I can sense their bodies!)

*Season focused and started to gather Astragons, causing a swirl of wind to blow around the cave.*

Season: *He quickly opened his eyes and three purple lights flashed under the rocks in different areas of the cave.* "I've been meaning to do this for some time now-"

*Season looked up with squinted eyes and a purple glyph suddenly flashed under his feet, teleporting him out of the cave.*

--

*A purple glyph drew itself on the ground outside and Season appeared on it, causing a pulse of dirt to blow away.*

Season: "Hmm.." *He stepped off the fading glyph and noticed three human silhouettes enveloped in stone.* "Ivan, Mae, Cyril-..."

*Sand blew off the stone silhouettes as a strong burst of wind blew across the area.*

Season: "I've dreamt of doing this for a long time, that is why, I know what I want to do, and say."

*Season shook his head in disappointment, as another strong gust of wind rapidly blew his robes to one side.*

Season: "I won't say this for selfish reasons nor to get it off my chest, but merely because I want to say this-"

*Screams echoed in the distance instantly catching Season's attention.*

Season: *He quickly glanced in the direction of the screams, humming in a curious manner.* "Screams? The closest village near The Turnback Cave would be-"

*Season mumbled in recollection and concentrated, cueing a glyph to begin drawing itself on the ground underneath him.*

Season: (Is this fate?) *He looked into the distance and noticed a trail of smoke rise into the sky, sniffing the distinctive smell of ash being carried in the wind.*

*The last line connected, forming the glyph under Season's feet, causing it to glow purple.*

Season: "I will be back." *He stared at the silhouettes and looked down with an emotional sigh, disappearing in a flash of purple light.*

----------

*Warriors scattered across a backwater village, dragged villagers one by one to a woman with the number twenty-six on her back armour.*

Twenty-six: *She stared at houses engulfed in flames and listened to constant crying, causing her to smirk.* (I need to impress the Consultant-)

*The smog caused the area to be slightly darker, giving the illusion the flames were larger than normal.*

Twenty-six: *She stood in a proud manner, focusing her attention to the approaching warriors.* "Over there." *She pointed to a line of villagers and took pleasure, as they stood on their knees like hostages.*

Hundred and Six: "Yes, ma'am." *He shouted in understanding and threw two small children on the dirt, watching them line themselves up with the other villagers.*

Twenty-six: (Things seem to be going in order-)

?????: "P-Please, stop! Why are you doing this?!" *A mature appearing man bound by three warriors, staggered up to twenty-six.*

Twenty-six: "This village mysteriously lost contact with the Consultants for quite some time." *She frowned in disgust and stepped forward, slapping the man across the face.*

?????: *He licked his lips and spat out blood.* "We just don't want your help."

Twenty-six: "It looks like you do." *She pointed to the burning houses, keeping a fixated glare on the man.*

?????: "You did that!-"

Twenty-six: "Shut up." *She screamed, backhanding the man across the face.*

?????: "You won't get away with this-"

Twenty-six: "Get him in line with the others-"

Season: *He appeared behind twenty-six and stepped off the fading glyph.* "What's going on here?"

Twenty-six: *She quickly spun around in shock.* "W-Who?!"

Season: *He looked around surprised at the damage of the village.* "Such violence."

?????: "H-Huh?" *He whispered to himself in disbelief, intensely staring at Season in shock.*

Twenty-six: "Who are you?! Answer me!"

*A woman screamed on her knees, catching Season's attention.*

Woman: "No!" *She shook her head, staring at a house on fire.* "My life's work is in there!"

Season: "This is catastrophic!" *He stepped forward and faced the house.*

Twenty-six: "You fool, don't be a hero, there're over fifty warriors located in this vicinity."

Season: "That's fantastic-"

Twenty-six: *She gagged in disbelief, frowning at Season's lack of care.* "And another thirty nearby!" *She looked over her shoulder and noticed ten warriors staring at Season in shock.*

Hundred and Thirty-seven: *He looked at the screaming woman and stamped towards her while rolling his eyes.* "Get up and be quiet!"

Season: "..." *He ignored number twenty-six and contemplated what to do.*

Twenty-six: "How dare you ignore me! Get him!" *She screamed at the warriors, causing them to jump with fear.*

Season: *He looked over his shoulder and noticed the warriors slowly approaching him.* "Before you attack me-"

*Season spoke with an echoing voice as a blue glyph shined under his feet.*

Season: "AQUA LIQUID" *He swayed his arms towards the burning houses, motioning a sudden wave of water around the fire.*

Woman: *She watched the wave of water swirl around her house, causing clouds of steam to sizzle from the windows.* "B-Bless the Astragons!"

*Villagers awed in surprise, watching the water extinguish the fire.*

Twenty-six: (A Rostical User!) *She stared at the water in awe and gasped in realisation, quickly frowning in anger.*

Season: "I won't harm any of you.. To an extent-" *He mumbled the last part of his sentence, readying himself.*

*Two warriors ran towards Season, raising their swords in anger.*

Season: (One hundred and thirty-seven? Putting three digit ranking warriors out on the front lines, what is Ridley planning? Maybe he's given up on the warrior system Kath and Millard spent so long to develop.)

*Season jumped back and cupped his hands, watching swirls of wind gather around them.*

Seventy-eight: "You won't harm us? Dream on!" *He ran into striking distance and ignored the growing power of wind around Season.*

Season: "FLURRY STYX" *He waited for the warriors to clutter before pushing forward, blasting a condensed ball of wind into the ground.*

Twenty-six: *She watched an explosion of dirt cover the surrounding warriors in shock.* "W-What?!"

Season: "I won't deny that fear is a good motivational tool."

Seventy-eight: "Argh!" *He wheezed and rolled to the side, grunting in the middle of the dirt cloud.*

Season: *He pointed at the dirt cloud and nudged forward, causing the dirt to swirl in a ring-like wave.* "WIND'S PULSE" *He spoke with a bored expression on his face, watching the swirl effectively clear the dirt away.*

Twenty-six: (That was two elemental affinities!-) *She gasped in thought, staring at the warriors lying motionless on the ground.* "H-How dare you!"

?????: (That's him!...) *The warriors who bound him let go, as they prepared to attack Season.*

Twenty-six: "Get up or the Consultant will destroy you all!" *Her threats caused more warriors to focus their attention on Season.*

Season: "Warriors, you don't have to fight!" *His powerful voice caused them to temporarily stop.* "Stop and think to yourselves, is this what you really want to be?" *He motioned his hand across the wet, charcoal houses.*

Sixty-four: "W-Well I don't want to, but my family has been threatened, if I don't obey the Consultant's orders-"

Twenty-six: "Shut up! Nobody asked for your life story!"

Sixty-four: "..." *He hesitantly nodded his head, slowly pointing a sword at Season.*

Season: *He sighed.* (The battle with mother has rekindled my powers once to their former glory..)

*Five warriors strategically surrounded Season and suddenly charged towards him at different angles.*

Season: *He smirked and stamped his foot, causing water to splash out of the ground.* "AQUATIC DIVIDER"

*Season swayed his arms to each side and two waves violently slammed into two warriors.*

Forty-nine: *A wave of water blasted a warrior past him, causing him to look over his shoulder in shock.* (I felt the power of Neurons in that water!)

Eighty-seven: *He whimpered and fell to the ground, drenched in fading water.* "H-Hurts.."

Season: *He ducked under a sword slash and raised his arms.* "PIERCING CLOUDS" *He lowered both arms and a wave of smog hit the surrounding warriors, causing them to wheeze to their knees.*

Forty-nine: "Kark-" (Felt like a punch in the stomach!)

Season: *He noticed a cluster of four warriors charging towards him.* "Oh dear-" *He stood up and pointed towards the warriors.* "WATER'S PULSE" *He nudged forward and a ring of water burst in front of the warriors.*

Twenty-six: *She watched the four warriors tumble back, as water sprinkled to the ground.* (He's powerful, I wasn't expecting someone like him to be in this backwater village.) "Everyone, get him!"

*Another twenty or so warriors raised their weapons and began to charge for Season.*

Season: *He sighed and raised both arms.* (I will use a strong technique, but intentionally miss-) *A bright yellow glyph shined under his feet.*

Twenty-six: *She stared at the glyph with gritted teeth, impatiently glancing at the warriors.* "Come on! At least get into striking distance before he prepares his Rostical!-"

Season: "Lightning pulse like veins, true power recharge and discharge and flow through the easiest current, LIGHTNING STRIKE"

*Warriors readied their weapons as they ran into striking distance.*

Season: "Pointless-" *He mumbled under his breath.*

Twenty-six: *She looked at Season in shock.* (That wave of Astragons-?!)

*Thick streams of lightning fell from the sky and exploded the ground in front of each cluster of warriors.*

Twenty-six: *She watched the lightning spark away, revealing the fear-filled warriors.* "U-Useless.."

Ninety-two: "I-I can feel the st-static!-"

Season: *He noticed the warrior's lack of will to fight, causing him to stare at twenty-six.* (The instigator-) "I have no desire to harm you either, lower your intent to hurt and-"

Twenty-six: "Shut up! As acting leader of this party-" *She reached behind her back and unsheathed a long sword.* "I will kill you myself."

Season: *He watched twenty-six charge towards him and looked past her, noticing a man stand up in anger.* "Revenge is not a great way to deal with grief or anger-" *He bent down to the ground and felt the dirt around him.*

?????: (Leader of the warriors?) *He grunted in anger, staring at twenty-six's back armour.* (I'll show her-) *He started to run after her, forming fists.*

Season: *He discreetly cut his hand on a sharp piece of rock on the ground.* "LIFA BLOSSOM" *He raised his arm and punched the ground, causing the dirt to harden.*

?????: "Huh?" *He looked down surprised as a massive tree shot up under him and threw him high into the air.* "G-Get me down!" *He looked down, watching the branches grow leaves.*

*The warriors and villagers gasped in awe as the tree garnered increasing attention.*

?????: *He looked down to the ground in shock.* (I'm up high! How-?! Where did this tree come from?!)

Twenty-six: *She looked behind her, staring at the tree in shock.* "What-?"

Season: "GROUND SHAKING" *He punched his fists together and punched them forward.* "Harh-" *He shouted with focus, watching differently-sized pillars of rock blast up around twenty-six, effectively trapping her.*

Twenty-six: "No-?!" *She tried to move her arms and legs, causing her to scream in frustration.* "Argh!"

*The warriors observed the tree and pillars of rock, causing them to lower their swords.*

Season: *He noticed the warriors' behaviour changes, causing him to stand in a more relaxed manner.* "I'm not saying to be weak and give up on anger and hatred-"

Twenty-six: "Shut up!" *She screamed in anger, continuing her desperate struggle to break free.*

Season: "Don't give up anger and hatred as they are a good source of energy, but-"

Twenty-six: "Kill him! Destroy him!-"

Season: "Be quiet." *He raised his hand at twenty-six and twisted his wrist, causing the pillars of rock to tighten.*

Twenty-six: "Argh!-" *She wheezed due to the growing pressure of the pillars, causing her to drop the long sword in pain.*

Season: "You need to learn how to focus that energy."

*Several warriors threw their weapons on the ground and bowed to Season.*

Season: "Rise! Don't fear my Rostical! I do not use it to obtain loyalty."

Forty-nine: *He looked confused and slowly stood up.* (What does he want from us then?)

Season: "I want this violence to stop!" *He shouted in a stern manner, looking over to the man stuck in the tree.*

?????: (Violence? Said the one that put me in a tree!-)

Season: "Dustin-" *He paused, sighing in an apologetic manner.* "I'm sincerely sorry, I took longer than I thought."

Dustin: *He stopped moving in the branches, staring at Season in shock.* (He remembered?)

Season: *He snapped his fingers and a gust of wind knocked Dustin off the tree.* "From now on, you are free to choose whatever path you want to walk on."

Dustin: *He stared at the ground in shock and braced himself for landing.* (I'm going to-) *A swirl of wind cushioned his fall, allowing him to step forward as if nothing happened.*

Season: *He scanned in front of him and observed the warriors and villagers, who stood in an army-like fashion.* "For those who wish to live their own lives, continue what you're doing, or you can choose to follow me-"

Forty-nine: "Choose to follow you? I've got nowhere to go?! I was picked up at Eon City when my parents died! Sorrowprax is all I got!"

Season: *He nodded his head.* "I promise as the leader of Surpreon, I can offer accommodation, places to work-"

Twenty-six: *She hissed towards Season, purposely interrupting his speech.* "You won't get away with-"

*Several warriors stood in front of twenty-six and cut her off, keeping their attention to Season.*

Twenty-six: "Why you!" *She hissed under her breath, glaring at the warrior's back, trying to remember their rankings.*

Season: "As warriors, I clearly remember one of the main moral codes, which seems to have obviously been lost in this generation."

Forty-nine: "W-What's that?" *He shouted with sincerity while keeping his brute-like attitude.*

Season: "Help those that are in need!" *He waved his hand across the destroyed village, shaking his head in disgust.*

*Several warriors observed the damage they caused, sparking chatter amongst themselves.*

Season: "I give you the choice."

Sixty-four: "What choice?" *He held his stomach, standing up with an awkward hunch.*

Season: "For those who choose to make the right choice, yet their choice, then head to Silver Wind Island."

Sixty-four: "Silver Wind Island-?"

Eighty-three: "So, you're not gonna fight us?" *He shouted out with a condescending tone, causing several warriors to chuckle in agreement.*

Season: "No."

Eighty-three: "That means you're weak!"

Season: *He ignored the warrior and focused his attention on Dustin.* "Dustin, that promise I made to you all those years ago." *He spread his legs and closed his eyes.* "I will show you why people call me, Season!"

Dustin: "..." *He stared at Season with widening eyes, unsure what to say.*

Season: "I, Caesar Seraph, will show you my power!"

*Thick clouds formed out of nowhere and started to rain, causing the warriors and villagers to look up.*

Season: *He stood still and raised his arms, frowning in deep concentration.* (Neurons, Astragons, affinities, splice, bend the elements, create life-)

Eighty-three: *He watched green vines sprout from the ground, noticing the rain extinguish the remaining fire.* "What the dirty lamp-..?"

Dustin: *He gasped in amazement and looked to each side in a childish manner, watching the village fill with green.* "Th-The crops!-"

Villager: "The crops are growing!"

*Flowers bloomed from the plants, causing a woman to gasp in disbelief.*

Woman: "Th-The vegetation! They're being revitalised!"

Eighty-three: *He reached up and took off his helmet, glancing to each side with a dropping jaw.* (That man is creating life...)

Sixty-four: *He watched the rain cleanse the charcoal and damages caused by the fire.* (I've never seen anything like this-)

Season: *He opened his eyes, as a swirl of wind and water pulsed away from him.* "Change the seasons!" *He yelled, causing several trees to erupt up from the ground.*

Warrior: *A tree with bright green leaves grew in thickness next to him.* "A-A-Amazing." *He touched the tree in amazement and brushed his hand along the leaves, causing water to flick off them.* "Is this really the power of Rostical?"

Season: *He stepped forward slightly drained and turned around, facing the warriors.* "I hope you all make the right choice-"

*Before anyone could respond or congratulate Season, a purple glyph suddenly flashed and teleported him out of the village.*

Eighty-three: *He held his hand out to catch the falling rain, mumbling to himself in shock.* "I take my statement back."

Dustin: *He gritted his teeth and ran out of the village, ignoring the Rostical's beauty.* (He can't do this.)

Twenty-six: *The pillars of rock disintegrated and released her, causing her to step forward in relief.* "How insolent, double digits come with me, triple digits report back to Sorrowprax!-"

Fifty-five: *She paused and took her helmet off, revealing her long brown hair.* "Do it yourself." *She threw her sword on the ground next to twenty-six and started to unbind the villagers.*

Twenty-six: "You dare-?!" *She looked around, noticing she was surrounded by warriors who opposed her.*

----------

*A purple glyph drew itself on the ground near the three stone silhouettes, blowing sticks and dirt away.*

Season: *He stepped off the fading glyph and looked at his hands, smiling in thought.* (Mother completely healed my stamina, or maybe I'm not used to being at my fullest potential again. I don't feel tired at all.)

*Season mumbled in recollection, triggering several flashbacks of him using the teleportation glyphs.*

Season: "It feels great keeping my promise."

*Sunlight shined brightly as the smog faded with the rainclouds Season summoned.*

Season: "Ivan-" *He stepped to the side and focused his attention on the stone sculptures, walking towards one of them.* "I will return to Silver Wind Island and tell Grey about your admirable heroism, and to give you the honour you deserve."

*Trees swayed in the wind, causing the distinctive sounds of leaves rustling to be heard.*

Season: "Cyril-"

*Season looked to the side and spoke to the next sculpture, walking in front of it.*

Season: "I was never fond of brute strength warriors, but believe it or not, I learnt a lot of things from you.. And ironically one of those things were-"

*Season took an emotional breath, as if he mentally prepared a speech a long time ago.*

Season: "You made me realise, even people who aren't very smart can give or teach you some amazing things."

*Season ran his finger along the stone sculptures, stopping in front of the last one.*

Season: "Mae-" *He took another deep breath, staring at the sculpture as if he didn't know what to say.* "I actually had a whole speech planned out, but.. I'm just going to use your catchphrase, the same catchphrase you used to scold Ivan and Cyril for-"

*Season smiled with emotion, staring at the sculpture in recollection.*

Season: "The time for grieving is over."

*Butterflies flapped past Season and the vegetation appeared vibrant, due to the sunlight.*

Season: "I miss you all, but if it wasn't for the pain I endured because of my selfishness-" *He had flashbacks of running out of the cave, causing him to frown with regret.* "I wouldn't be the person I am now. I won't turn my back on the people I care about ever again-"

*The sound of sticks cracking caught Season's attention, causing him to look over his shoulder.*

Dustin: *He ran through the bushes and stopped as soon as Season was in his eyesight.* "You-" *He bent forward, placing his hands on his knees in exhaustion.*

Season: "Dustin? Why did you follow me?"

Dustin: "W-What did you do?"

Season: "I kept my promise-"

Dustin: "No, the warriors apologised after you left and started to help rebuild the village."

Season: *He looked shocked, before smiling in a proud manner.* "That's a good thing, I don't see where you're coming from?"

Dustin: "If you possessed manipulative powers from the start-" *Season startled to chuckle.* "What's so funny?!" *His tone was filled with annoyance.*

Season: "Of course not-"

Dustin: "Not? Not what?"

Season: "I don't possess any manipulative abilities. I was not blessed with such powers."

Dustin: "So then, why-?"

Season: "But, Dustin." *He spoke in a serious manner and stepped to the side, facing Dustin.* "That day.. I wanted to thank you again for releasing me."

Dustin: *He paused, shaking his head with a frown.* "You said you were going to revitalise the village."

Season: "I just did-"

Dustin: "Look at me!"

Season: "..."

Dustin: "You haven't aged at all, how long was I meant to wait for you?!"

Season: "What's done is done, there's nothing I can do now."

Dustin: *He looked frustrated and angry.* (He's.. Right though-)

Season: *He walked up to Dustin, observing his facial hair and battle scars.* (He looks older than me-) "Dustin, I envy you."

Dustin: "W-... Huh? Don't insult me, you've got powers to create life!-"

Season: "Your courage is amazing-"

Dustin: "Then take it, let's swap! I'll have Rostical and you can have my courage-"

Season: "LIGHTNING SLICE" *He clicked his fingers, causing lightning to spark around his hand.*

Dustin: *He gasped with widening eyes, intensely staring at the lightning.* (Lightning!)

Season: *The lightning shaped itself into a spear, forming in between his fingers.* "Having power doesn't solve everything!"

Dustin: *His face lit up due to the lightning.* (Is he going to kill me?) *He stood straight with a serious face, hiding his fear.*

Season: "Harh!" *He suddenly threw the spear past Dustin and two human-sized bee-like Scoldrants fell to the ground.*

Dustin: *He looked behind him, noticing the Scoldrants' wings and insect-like legs twitch on the ground.* (Scoldrants-?!)

Season: "You want power? Courage is power, look at you." *He observed Dustin's proud and brave face.*

Dustin: *He focused his attention back to Season, shaking off his uneasiness.* "But-"

Season: "I would've run away.. If I had your courage, my closest friends would still be with me. You are someone of real leadership."

Dustin: "This conversation is everywhere, why am I good at being a leader?"

Season: "Please keep up, it's because of your courage. The reason those warriors chose to withdraw or lower their weapons was due to a leader figure they saw before them."

Dustin: *He raised an eyebrow in confusion.* "What are we talking about?"

Season: *He stepped forward, placing his hand on Dustin's shoulder.* "I respect your bravery, I understood that when I placed you in an awkward position that long ago."

Dustin: "..."

Season: "Lead by example, teach the warriors what truly matters."

Dustin: (By example?)

*Season slid his hand away, as he turned around to face the stone sculptures.*

Dustin: "Teach them what?"

Season: "That's something you already know."

*A large glyph drew itself on the ground around the stone sculptures, causing Season to walk closer to them.*

Season: "Maintain the crops which now bloom with life."

Dustin: "You're leaving?!"

Season: "Yes. I've decided to finally join the party on their quest."

Dustin: "The party?"

Season: *He stopped next to the sculptures, facing Dustin with determination.* "I can't rule Surpreon at ease knowing there's such a great threat outside."

Dustin: "Your visit, was it coincidental?"

Season: "How so?" *His face glowed purple due to the activating glyph.*

Dustin: "How the warriors took over the village."

Season: "I'm not sure. A lot of strange things stopped me from visiting earlier."

Dustin: "Like what?"

Season: "It doesn't matter, maybe it was just meant to be?" *He shrugged his shoulders as he quickly dismissed the thought.*

Dustin: "This feels weird-"

Season: "All emotions make us what and who we are, embrace them. Don't run away as I did."

Dustin: *He stepped forward.* "I've been selfishly blaming you for not coming sooner. So, thank you."

Season: "You're very welcome." *His voice echoed as he disappeared with the glyph.*

Dustin: *He paused and turned around, touching his chest.* (He saw something in me-) "Lead by example, huh?" *He mumbled to himself and started to walk back to the village with a widening smile.*

----------

Season: *He watched the area blur and swirl around him, as he waited patiently on the teleportation glyph.* (I don't have the heart to move them from their resting place-)

-

*Season and the three human, statue-like silhouettes, appeared in front of Turnback Cave in a flash of purple light.*

Season: *He looked at the statues, glancing at the cave's entrance.* "Dustin-?"

*Season observed the area around him and noticed Dustin had left, before watching purple light fade with the glyph.*

Season: (The warriors, seeing Dustin, the houses, maybe it was more than coincidence after all?)

*Tremors vibrated along the ground, caused by the volcanic activity deep inside the cave.*

Season: "There's nothing I can do or say to justify what I did, but I will live on happy having your personalities engraved in my memories." *He clapped his hands and focused, causing a white glyph to form itself under the statues.*

*The glyph started to glitter and vines started to grow around the statues.*

Season: "You three were the best things to ever happen to me." *He looked down to the ground, triggering a flashback.*

--

*Season, Mae, Cyril and Ivan watched a beautiful sunset on the beach.*

Mae: "It's pretty."

Cyril: "It's orange." *He grunted and rolled his eyes, purposely mocking Mae.*

Ivan: "Haha."

Cyril: "What are you laughing at, rodent." *He playfully punched Ivan on the shoulder.*

Mae: "Guys don't understand the magnificence of this." *She shook her head in a condescending manner, waving across the sky.*

Season: *He smiled and nodded his head, looking to his side at the party.* "That was one of our longest missions."

Ivan: *He nodded his head, stroking his RPG bag in recollection.* "Mae, y-you're holding up fine."

Cyril: "Ivan." *He moaned at Ivan in annoyance, as if he shouldn't have mentioned that.*

Ivan: "S-Sorry."

Mae: "N-No, it's fine."

Season: *He looked at Mae with a sad expression on his face.* (During our mission, we found a small tribe East off the coast of The Elemental Tower.)

Cyril: "Now that our buddy Season here brought it up, we might as well talk about."

Season: "Sorry." *He leant back, pulling an awkward face.*

Ivan: "Mae, your fellow Scoldrant Users were-"

Mae: "Killed, I know." *She looked down and sighed with sorrow, nodding her head in acceptance.*

Cyril: "How can you do it?" *He admired her strong will.*

Mae: *She looked up to the sky, flicking hair out of her face.* "Life is too short, why let something that's already happened keep you down?"

Ivan: "But-"

Mae: "The time for sorrow is over, keep your head up high, things can only start to look better when you've hit rock bottom."

Season: "Mae-"

Mae: "I've already grieved over it.. And I won't let it keep me down." *She smiled and her eyes glazed in the setting sun.*

Cyril: "A little girly for me, but I'm glad to have an awesome gal like you in my party."

Ivan: *He wiped a tear from his cheek and sniffed, smiling in a pretended masculine fashion.* "Y-Yeah, girly."

Cyril: "Herherh! I like being a warrior, but it kinda feels like we're not doing it right."

Mae: *She looked at Cyril, nodding her head in agreement.* "..."

Season: "Right, as the party leader, I'll see to it!" *He formed a fist, smiling in determination.*

Mae: "To..?" *She smirked and waved her hand, implying for Season to continue.*

Season: *He glanced at each party member, frowning with a widening smile.* "That we'll only have good moments from here on out."

Cyril: "Now you're talking!"
Mae: "Hehe."

Ivan: *He smiled, leaning forward in interest.* "W-What's the plan?"

Season: "Well-"

--

Season: *Tears ran down his face, as he recalled the memory.* (Now, I have new companions, and that is why I'm going to help them in their quest.)

*The vines' growth around the sculptures slowed down, due to nearing completion.*

Season: *He looked up, watching purple and white flowers bloom on the vines.* (My friends, be the Guardians of this amazing cave.)

*The vines stopped growing and tightened, forming a solid professional-like wooden shrine.*

Season: *He observed the shrine which grew over the cave's entrance like an enclosure.* "Before I leave-"

*Season wiped the tears away and took a deep breath as if he hadn't finished talking to his friends.*

Season: "I managed to make it back to Surpreon-" *He stared at the shrine and smiled, as if he knew they'd be proud of him.* "I quickly gained the trust of the previous ruler who fell ill due to old age. I then became the successor and have been ever since. I couldn't have done it without any of your help."

*Season paused as if he struggled to internalise what he really wanted to say.*

Season: "I'm sorry I was a coward.."

Mae: "Life is too short, why let something that's already happened keep you down?"

Season: *He sniffed and sighed, lowering his head.* "It doesn't matter if you live ninety or nine hundred years, life is too short-"

Mae: "The time for sorrow is over, keep your head up high, things can only start to look better when you've hit rock bottom."

Season: *He slowly raised his head.* "I will keep my head up high, not for myself, but for my friends."

Mae: "I've already grieved over it.. And I won't let it keep me down."

Season: "Farewell my close friends."

*Season spoke in gratitude and turned around full of closure, slowly walking towards a forming glyph.*

Season: *He sniffed again.* (I should rest at Silver Wind Island for refuge, then head back to Surpreon to find out when The Rubistral Moon is-)

*Season stopped on top of the glowing glyph, looking up to the sky.*

Season: (It's nearing the full moon.)

*Season closed his eyes and disappeared in a flash of purple light, causing a swirl of dirt to spiral in the air.*

Chapter 6: Lance's Tale

Chrisma: *She spun around in amazement and groaned, tugging on her robes.* (So much has happened-)

*Dirt and dust floated in the beams of light which shined through the hole in the roof.*

Chrisma: (I'm standing in the last Unknown Territory! I travelled to another world! I can't wait to tell you Joy and Lupton!)

Lance: *He shook his head in shock while placing a hand on his head.* "..."

Tyler: *He stared at Lance in disbelief, holding onto the strap to his RPG bag.* (That was a shock, finding out Kairi or Miss. Lighten knows about Rostical.)

Lance: "I don't..." *He mumbled under his breath, triggering images of Kairi's reaction to the glyph.*

Kairi: "Remenistal?!"

Lance: "Wat did you-?"

Kairi: "T-Tell Celest to use The Voice of On to remove Leon's seal!"

Chrisma: "Oh bless." *She looked at Lance, whispering under her breath.*

Madora: *She kept her eyes shut, trying not to display her overwhelming emotion.* (Tarlea...)

Alicia: "Lance?" *She stood by his side and nudged his shoulder.*

Lance: "I want to see-"

Madora: "Celest?" *She opened her eyes, staring at the debris scattered across the floor.*

Lance: *He faced Madora, nodding his head in a serious manner.* "Yea."

Madora: "But-"

Lance: "But?" *He grunted and stepped forward with sudden impatience.*

Madora: "I just sent you through a Spacial Funnel to a world without Rostical."

Lance: "Aye?"

Madora: "I did this without any circumstances to boost my power."

Lance: "Huh?"

Madora: "Despite being an Ougi, I usually have the certain and specific requirements to open a Spacial Funnel of that calibre-"

Lance: "Wat are ya saying?" *He grunted in frustration, wanting to know why he can't get transported.*

Tyler: "It means, she might not have the power to transport us right now."

Lance: "Wut?"

Tyler: (He's really blunt at times...)

Madora: "The vast ocean between the two continents is troubling to teleport over when you're weak."

Lance: "I'm not weak?"

Chrisma: "She meant herself." *She looked at Lance, cupping her hands.*

Tyler: *He looked at Madora, observing her carefree expression on her face.* (She doesn't look worried, she must have some other plan-)

Lance: "So, wat does this mean?" *He grunted softly as if he only cared about leaving.*

Alicia: "..." *She nervously stared at Madora in suspense for Lance.*

Madora: "There is another way to enter Valhalla, and that's by visiting Arcadia."

Lance: "Well, that's settled, send us there." *He folded his arms and looked away as a child, attempting to prematurely end the conversation.*

Alicia: "L-Lance." *She nudged his side.*

Lance: *He sighed under his breath, rolling his eyes.* "Please?"

Alicia: "..." *She smiled, nodding her head in a proud manner.*

Madora: "Oh my, just a moment." *She closed her eyes.*

Lance: *He stared at Madora with a disapproving face.* "Seriously? Wat are you doin'?"

Madora: "I'm checking how much energy I have left."

Lance: "I thought you were like the kingdom of Astragongs 'n' stuff?"

Tyler: "Lance-"

Lance: "Oh, wateva, your highness."

Tyler: *He sighed under his breath as if he was over Lance's immaturity.* (How can someone in their twenties still be so immature?)

Lance: "Aha, no response, I win-"

Madora: *She opened her eyes, catching Lance's attention.* "I can only send two of you-"

Lance: "Me 'n' Alicia, let's go." *He impatiently grunted, as if the answer was obvious.*

Madora: "What about-?" *She tilted her head to Tyler and Chrisma, waiting for their response.*

Tyler: "It's fine." *He smiled with a sigh, holding onto his RPG bag.*

Chrisma: "But-, I-, Valhalla-"

*Tyler purposely and obviously coughed, causing Chrisma to hesitantly nod her head to say it's fine.*

Lance: "See they're fine!-"

Tyler: *He rolled his eyes in a mature manner.* (Gee, thanks Lance.)

Madora: *She looked at Lance and Alicia and hummed in thought, glancing between the two.* "Alicia, you're in charge."

Lance: "Great, we're off!-. Wait, wat?!"

Alicia: "Tee hee."

Lance: "Don't laugh!" *He quickly faced Alicia in disgust, pointing at her with a slight hiss.*

Alicia: "Grottom bottom."

Madora: "I want someone with a mature-" *She stared at Lance, cueing her to pause with a sigh.*

Lance: "Oi, there's nothin' wrong with my bottom!" *He awkwardly looked over his shoulder, trying to stare at his lower back.*

Alicia: *She ignored Lance, focusing her attention on Madora.* "Madora?"

Madora: "Ahem. I want someone with a mature state of mind to make their way through Sakura Village."

Lance: *He stopped what he was doing, looking at Madora.* (Sakura Village?)

Alicia: "But I've never heard, or even read anything about Sakura Village."

Madora: "You will be fine."

Lance: "Yea I know, I'll be there." *He folded his arms, smirking like a child.*

Alicia: *She smiled, looking at Lance in the corner of her eye.* "What would you like us to do?" *She spoke with a serious tone and face.*

Madora: "I predict you might have a few troubles getting to Arcadia, but once you do, let her know you're allies of Celest, Locki and myself."

Alicia: *She took a deep breath and nodded her head, standing with leadership.* "Right."

Tyler: *He observed Alicia, noticing her leadership-like stance.* (Alicia looks, odd. Standing like that, it doesn't suit her personality.)

Lance: "Wateva, stop actin' tough." *He grunted at Alicia, looking around like a child.* "Old fart, where's the glyphy thingy?"

Madora: "My, my, still so full of life, aren't you?"

Lance: "Still not interested, and I'm taken now."

Tyler: *He chuckled at Lance's behaviour, quickly pretending he didn't find it funny.* (That's so rude.)

Madora: "Send my greetings to Celest and Locki for me."

Alicia: "I-I will."

Madora: *She smiled in appreciation.* "Good luck."

Alicia: "Thank-"

Madora: "..." *She snapped her fingers, causing Lance and Alicia to disappear in a flash of aurora coloured lights.*

Chrisma: *She paused and looked down, whimpering in disappointment.* (I really wanted to go see Valhalla.)

Tyler: *He scratched a pimple on his face, looking to his side at Chrisma.* "Don't look so down."

Chrisma: "Umm, oh bless." *She spoke with no enthusiasm, putting on a fake smile.*

Madora: (I wonder what kind of events will take place now?)

Tyler: *He glanced around and blew out of his mouth in boredom, adjusting the RPG bag's strap around his shoulder.* "So, what do we do?"

Madora: "I won't be able to send you to Surpreon, but once my Neurons have restored a little, I can send you to Silver Wind Island."

Tyler: "And we can teleport from there." *He spoke while nodding his head.*

Madora: "Exactly."

Chrisma: (Silver Wind Island is close to my home, I could even pay everyone a visit-) *She paused, yawning in thought.*

Tyler: (I've got myself in a routine, it feels strange not to fill in any reports or detailed schematics.) *He nervously rubbed the RPG bag with his thumb, trying to think of something to say.*

Chrisma: *She had images of The Lost City and smiled, slowly shaking her head in dismissal.* (No, I can't go back home without Joy and Lupton.)

Tyler: *He mumbled in thought and suddenly raised an eyebrow in curiosity, looking at Madora intrigued.* "So, umm, how exactly can they get to Valhalla?"

Chrisma: "Tyler?"

Tyler: "I kind of assumed the path in Concern's Gate was the only way to enter it."

Madora: "It is."

Chrisma: "Only way to enter it? Wharh?" *She groaned, bending forward in confusion.*

Tyler: "Then, why would you send them to Sakura Village?"

Chrisma: "Isn't it because you were too drained?"

Tyler: "Hmm? You could've sent them to Concern's Gate later." *He mumbled in agreement, waiting for Madora's answer.*

Madora: "The path is the only way one can physically enter Valhalla."

*Tyler and Chrisma glanced at each other with dumbfounded faces and paused, looking at Madora in confusion.*

----------

*Lance and Alicia both stepped forward with a loss of balance, inspecting the area around them.*

Lance: *He looked down and stamped on dirt ground, noticing patches of brown grass, scattered across the area.* (This place looks feral-)

Alicia: "Wow." *She instantly noticed an enormous wooden fortress, which circled around itself, acting as a defensive barrier.*

Lance: "So, now that we're outta Madora's wrath, I'm the leader." *He sniffed his finger, looking at Alicia with confidence.*

Alicia: "N-No."

Lance: "Aye?" *He grunted with a shocked frown, quickly picking his nose.*

Alicia: "I-I've been made leader-"

Lance: "Pssht! Just because you're beautiful doesn't excuse this dumb-dumb, cow-cow of a personality."

Alicia: "W-What ever."

Lance: *He gasped sarcastic-like, waving the finger he picked his nose within Alicia's face.* "Do you want an award for a little bit of character development?"

Alicia: "Eww-" *She gently slapped his hand away, causing him to chuckle with an evil frown.*

Lance: "Yay, wow, you can talk back now-"

Alicia: "Says the grottom bottom who is having a sook because he's not in charge." *She smiled, pretending to be professional.*

Lance: "Well, why I never." *He sarcastically gasped and folded his arms, looking away in respect.* "Lead the way, captain Alicia."

Alicia: *She tried to hide her smile and started to walk towards the wooden fortress, causing Lance to follow in a sheep-like manner.* "I don't see how one could get in-"

Lance: "Me neither." *He sighed under his breath, placing his hands on his head.*

Alicia: *She closer inspected the fortress, shaking her head in confusion.* "There's no door."

Lance: "Beats me." *He shrugged his shoulders, purposely putting in no effort.*

Alicia: "Lance, help me." *She sounded annoyed, causing Lance to walk faster.*

Lance: *He lowered his arms and walked by Alicia's side, grunting in a defeated manner.* "Ya lucky, I just decided to help."

Alicia: "Why?" *She sounded distracted, as she kept her attention to the wooden fortress.*

Lance: "Why? Umm-" *He looked up in thought, slowly sticking his finger back his nose.* "Only, because I want to find out what my mother was talking about."

Alicia: *She smiled in appreciation, knowing what Lance's true intentions were.* "Okay."

Lance: "So, wat's the prob?"

Alicia: *She pointed to the fortress, biting her bottom lip in disappointment.* "There's no entrance, and there're no signs of people to ask."

Lance: "Ask?" *He grunted with a feral tone, leaning to one side in confusion.*

Alicia: "To ask how we can enter the fortress."

Lance: "But there's nobody around, aye."

Alicia: "..." *She looked at Lance annoyed, as if she just explained the problem.*

Lance: "Wat about the people in the wooden bowl?" *He grunted, pointing at the fortress in confusion.*

Alicia: *She nodded her head in agreement.* "We need to find some way to get attention."

Lance: "We need attention? But seeking attention should be your speciality."

Alicia: *She stopped and sighed, focusing her frustration on to Lance.* "L-Lance-"

Lance: "But, ya know, I'm pretty good at that too." *He raised his hand in the air and shot out a small stream of lightning, causing the surrounding area to light up.*

Alicia: *She smiled, watching the lightning disintegrate into nothing.* (Good idea, Lance.)

Lance: *He lowered his arm and smirked, shaking his wrist.* "Well?"

Alicia: *She looked around and lowered her shoulders with disappointment.* "Nothing, no response in sight."

Lance: "Aye?" *He stepped back as if was about to enjoy the moment.*

Alicia: "Lance-?"

Lance: "Hey, please cover your ears." *He sounded protective and caring, rubbing his hands together in excitement.*

Alicia: "Yep." *She eagerly nodded her head and covered her ears, bracing herself for the unknown.*

Lance: "THUNDER BOOM" *He spread his arms and clapped, causing four echoing thunders to rumble through the air.*

Alicia: (I felt the air vibrate!)

Lance: "Hermm?" *He lowered his arms, looking around with suspense.* (That was pretty loud-) *He glanced at Alicia and motioned his hand, causing her to lower her arms.*

Alicia: "A-Anything?"

Lance: "... No-" *He tilted his head and concentrated, trying to listen to the area.*

Alicia: (Maybe I should use Icicle Edge? Or Healing Rings for the light-)

*Lance heard noises faintly echo in the wind, instantly catching his attention with a gasp.*

Lance: "Wait-?"
Alicia: "Did you-?"

Lance: "Oi, I heard stuff coming from the other side of the fortress bowl thingy!" *He smirked in accomplishment, looking at Alicia.*

Alicia: "Yay-"

Lance: "We got the attention we needed and you didn't even have to fart!"

Alicia: "L-Lance!-"

Lance: "Settle it down, turbo. Was only jokin'." *He smirked, nudging her in a playful manner.*

Alicia: *She nervously brushed her hair behind her ear and held onto Lance's arm, waiting for something to happen.* "Did you think it worked?"

Lance: *He nodded his head, intensely staring at the fortress.* "Nah, I definitely heard somethin'-"

?????: "Ey, who is foolish enough to cause havoc on this village?"

*A woman with a deep voice yelled out from the fortress, causing Lance to chuckle.*

Alicia: (Can she see us?)

Lance: "Who uses the word foolish-?"

Alicia: "Ahem." *She took a deep breath and stepped forward, acting as party leader.* "We are here to see Arcadia."

?????: "Ey, Arcadia?" (She did not tell me she was expecting other visitors-) "What business do you have here?"

Alicia: "Under orders of Madora-"

?????: "Ykkt!"

*Two large logs violently rumbled and moved on their own accord, forming an entrance.*

Lance: *He stared at the gap-like entrance, nodding his head in approval.* "Nice-"

?????: *She walked out of the gap and faced Alicia, confronting her in an intimidating manner.* "Ey, Madora? You must be lying." *She crossed her arms which were covered in white bandages.*

Lance: *He looked shocked and slightly leant forward, closely inspecting the woman's long black hair and facial features.* (She looks Asian.)

?????: (The Remenistal Thunder Boom-) *She glanced around the entrance of Sakura Village and slightly squinted her eyes.* (It appears these two are the only-)

*The woman paused in thought, watching Lance awkwardly and blatantly stare at her.*

?????: *She shook her head and closed her eyes momentarily as if she was feeling the air around her.* "Judging by your Neuronic signatures and Astragon output, you two are Remenistal Users."

Lance: "Whoa, Teresa!-"

?????: (He appears to be a dunce. I shall ignore his trivially predictable, yet, illogical future requests and statements.) *She ignored Lance with an emotionless face while staring at Alicia.* "Ey, I am waiting for your response in reaction to my accusation."

Alicia: "No, I'm not lying!" *She shook her head, taking notice to the woman's beautifully long black hair.* "Are.. Are you related to her?"

?????: "Ey, it is just the hair." *She hissed as if she was asked that question quite often.* "Arcadia is very busy right now."

Alicia: "B-But-"

?????: (The female appears to be annoying, too-) "Ey? No buts." *Her words caused Alicia to nervously and silently bite her bottom lip.*

Alicia: (Madora said-)

Lance: "Sorry, Alicia." *He mumbled under his breath, puffing out his chest in a confronting manner.* "Ah no-"

?????: "Yohoho!"

Lance: "We need to see her now."

Alicia: "Lance-" *She looked over her shoulder, glancing at Lance as if she wasn't expecting his response.*

?????: "Yohohoho, ey, puffing out your chest?"

Lance: *He purposely shook his head, implying the woman's voice was bad.* "Wateva."

?????: *She shook her head in disgust.* "Your body posture does not affect me in the slightest."

Lance: "And I thought Twotters' laugh was bad-"

?????: "If you want to see her so badly, perhaps you would not mind fighting me for such a reward?" *She smirked and bent at the knees, standing in a battle-ready pose.* "Please respond?"

Lance: "Ha! You're on!"

Holland: *He walked out from the gap and towards the woman, distracted by thought.* "Hey, is there anything wrong? Freya can smell-"

*Holland looked up, instantly noticing Lance and Alicia with a dropping jaw.*

Holland: "Hey, what are you two doing?!" *He happily yelled out in surprise, catching the woman's attention.*

?????: *She looked over her shoulder, staring at Holland in shock.* (Huh?)

Alicia: "H-Holland?"
Lance: "Hey-hey, Holland!-" *He frowned at the woman with a widening smile, as if he was happy to see Holland.*

?????: (This man knows this pathetically poor-statured woman with an obvious confidence problem and the dunce?)

Lance: "Want to help us fight this woman?"

Holland: "Nah, Ginger will beat me." *His own words triggered a flashback of a comet smashing into PKMY.*

Ginger: "Ey, Holland, you know this half-wit? Please respond." *She focused her attention back to Lance, standing in a more casual manner.*

Lance: "Halfwit?!" *He shouted, stamping his foot in a child-like manner.*

Ginger: "Perhaps dunce would suffice?"

Lance: "Wat's that?"

Ginger: "Precisely."

Holland: *He stopped next to Ginger, happily looking at Lance and Alicia.* "Ginger, this is Lance and Alicia."

Ginger: (Ey, Lance and Alicia? So I'll finally get to meet them...) *She thought with an emotionless face, ensuring the bandages around her arms were tight.* (Arcadia has mentioned these two in the past, yet, judging from words alone, I am simply underwhelmed what the future holds for these two.)

Alicia: "Come on, Lance." *She whispered to Lance and started to walk towards Ginger and Holland.*

Lance: "Call me a halfwit." *He mumbled to himself and followed Alicia, frowning in a child-like manner.* (And wateva a dunce is, aye.)

Alicia: "I'm pleased to meet you." *She stopped and bowed in respect, nervously biting her bottom lip.*

Lance: "Well I'm not, pssht."

Ginger: *She spun around and faced the village.* "Remember, Arcadia is in deep thought." *She sighed in a mature manner, flicking her well-groomed hair over her shoulder.*

Holland: "Arcadia?" *He looked at Ginger puzzled, as if he didn't know what she was talking about.*

Ginger: "That is who they want." *She started to walk towards the village.*

Holland: *He looked at Alicia and Lance, raising an eyebrow in confusion.* "Is that why you two are here?"

Lance: "Yea."

Holland: "Oh, and here I am thinking you two were visiting us."

Lance: "Aha, yea nah." *He rolled his eyes and walked past Holland, closely following Ginger.*

Alicia: (Lance...) *She paused, staring at his back in a worried manner.*

Holland: "What's up?" *He slightly hunched forward, mumbling to Alicia in curiosity.*

Alicia: "He's cranky because he's impatient."

Holland: "No, why are you here?" *He nudged his head and started to walk towards the village, cueing Alicia to follow.*

Alicia: "Oh, tee hee." *She giggled at herself, cupping her pendant with both hands.*

Holland: "Ha ha, so?"

Alicia: "Umm, we need to go to Valhalla."

Holland: "Valhalla again?"

Alicia: "Y-Yep, we need to see some people."

Holland: "Oh, fair enough-" *He mumbled in thought, recalling the time the rainbow coloured aura repelled him onto the ground.* "Why here? What about Concern's Gate?"

Alicia: "Madora couldn't send us there."

Holland: "You were still with Madora?"

Alicia: "Yep." *She paused and paid more attention to the gap-like entrance, as she walked closer to the village.*

Holland: "It feels weird how we've all separated."

Alicia: "I agree!" *She looked at Holland, eagerly nodding her head in agreement.*

Holland: (Glad it's not just me-)

Alicia: *She watched Ginger and Lance leave her sight, causing her to pout in thought.* "How come you came out? If you hadn't, Lance might have ended up fighting her."

Holland: "Don't worry, Ginger tried to fight us too."

Alicia: "Sh-She did?"

Holland: "Yeah, and I came out because Freya smelt familiar scents outside."

Alicia: "Really?" *She looked amazed, rubbing the pendant with her thumbs.* "That's awesome."

Holland: *He smiled in response.* "Yeah, she is-"

Lance: "Whoa!" *His awes echoed from behind the wooden fortress, catching Alicia's attention.*

Holland: (That was my reaction too.)

Alicia: "Lance." *She walked slightly faster, past the fortress and looked at Lance, watching him stare out into the village.*

Lance: (Every village looked unique or old-fashioned, but this place has a completely different feelin' to it.)

Holland: "Hmph." *He smirked and leant against the wood as it closed up behind him.* "Not bad, hey?"

Lance: *He looked down in amazement, smiling with a dropping jaw.* "I rekon, it's wicked."
Alicia: "It-It's beautiful."

Lance: *He coughed and deeply inhaled, readying himself.* "Thick cherry blossom trees filled the village with a vibrant pink colour."

Holland: (Haha, not this again-)

Lance: "Polished well-maintained wooden bridges arched over a small lake, made of stone-"

*Lance scanned across the village and squinted his eyes, picking his nose in thought.*

Holland: "Ha ha, glad to see he hasn't changed."

Alicia: "..." *She smiled to herself in thought, knowing the relationship between them.*

Ginger: (Yoh? The Radiaton User-) *She faced Lance while playing with the bandages on her arms.* (Ey, Lezard does this? Is this a trend outside the village?)

Lance: "The top of wooden houses had unusual and spectacular designs, which gave a visitor a foreign feeling."

Ginger: *She looked at Lance in disgust, momentarily waiting for him to admire the village.* (How trivial...)

Lance: *He chuckled in amazement, continuing to admire the village.* (I've always dreamt to visit Japan or China-)

Alicia: *She smiled at Lance's reaction to the village.* (He's so cute.)

Ginger: (What a dunce.)

Holland: *He noticed Alicia's smile towards Lance, causing him to smirk.* "Smiling at Lance I see?"

Alicia: "I, umm, n-no." *She blushed in denial.*

Ginger: (Why is he smiling like a crazed Scoldrant?) *She shook her head and turned around, starting to walk away.* (Ey, Lezard. I thought he was the weirdo.)

Holland: *He leant off the wood and made his way towards a house with a polished wooden veranda.* "So, you want to see Arcadia?" *He mumbled in a deep voice, scratching the side of his arm.*

Lance: "Oh yea." *He spoke in a dumbfounded manner, as if he forgot what he was doing.*

Alicia: *She walked up to Lance and grabbed his arm, quickly following Holland.* "How long have you been here for?"

Holland: "Not long, PKMY has almost finished her training."

Lance: "Huh? Docta Jingles is here?"

Ginger: (Almost finished? Surely not. I successfully hit her with a Comet's Viel-)

Holland: "Ha ha, yeah she is." *He chuckled, walking around an expensive-looking garden towards the house.*

*A distinctive sound of bamboo hitting rock could be heard, causing Alicia to quickly look behind her in shock.*

Alicia: "W-What was that?"

Lance: *He ignored Alicia, listening to his surroundings.* "Sounds of gushing of water could be heard filling something to the top."

Ginger: (Yet, he continues to do so. How trivial, illogical-) *She paused and shook her head at herself.* (Negatory, it does make sense. Ensuring the fact he is indeed, a dunce, then his personality has been justified.)

Holland: "..." *He stepped onto the veranda and slowed down, waiting for Lance and Alicia to catch up.*

Alicia: "What is that? It sounds like water filling something hollow up?" *She looked around in confusion, as she stepped onto the veranda.*

Lance: "Ooo-" *He clicked his fingers in realisation, as if he knew what the sounds were.* "It's one of those garden thingys, where water fills a hollow stick and it falls over making that sound."

Alicia: "Oh wow-" *She smiled with surprise and understanding.* (I never would've thought of that.)

Holland: "It was annoying at first, but then again, I realised I was friends with Lance, so it was all good."

Lance: *He smirked, placing his hands on his head.* "Oh, I'm sorry, that was so funny I forgot to laugh."

Alicia: "Tee hee-"

Holland: *He paused, mumbling with contemplation.* "Ah, not to interrupt, but don't be freaked out by PKMY."

Alicia: "H-How come?" *She stared at Holland, nervously biting her bottom lip.*

Lance: "I already was, so I have no problem." *He grinned in a childish manner and suddenly glanced to each side, distracted by the uniqueness of the village.*

Holland: *He looked at Lance and nodded his head, focusing his attention on Alicia.* "Okay?"

Alicia: "Yep."

Holland: "Appreciate it." *He nodded his head and smiled, facing a green door with red frames.*

Alicia: (Why was Holland worried about us meeting PKMY?)

Holland: *He stepped forward and touched the red flames, causing the door to burn into flames.* "She's in here-"

Lance: "Holy flamin' shit nuggets!-" *He gagged in shock, pointing at the door-sized wall of flames like a child.* " Literally! Flamin'-"

Holland: "Shh." *He watched the flames extinguish, allowing him to step into the house.*

Lance: "Wat a crazy-" *He hesitantly followed Holland into the house, inspecting the door frame in a paranoid manner.*

Alicia: *She held onto Lance's elbow and looked behind her, watching the door reappear in a pulse of flames.* (Wow-..)

Lance: *He looked at Holland to inquire about the door, instantly noticing Arcadia sitting in a wooden wheelchair.* (What the-?)

PKMY: "Holly-?" *Her back faced the party as she sat in a meditative-like position.* ".. Lance and Alicia? I'm surprised you two are here."

Lance: "Aye?" *He stared at PKMY's back in confusion, raising an eyebrow.* "How-?"

PKMY: "You're surprised and a little freaked out. Alicia's nervous as ever."

Alicia: "H-How-?"
Lance: "W-?!"

PKMY: "Wat are ya talkin' 'bout? You're crazy."

Lance: "A-Arh.." *His eyes widened in shock.*

Alicia: "Wow-"
PKMY: "Wow, that's amazing, PKMY."

Alicia: "Y-Yes?" *She spoke in astonishment and looked up to Holland, as if his previous attitude finally made sense.*

?????: *The woman wheeled herself closer to PKMY, oblivious to Alicia and Lance's presence.* "Your training is almost complete."

Holland: *He looked at the woman in the wheelchair and stepped to the side, revealing Lance and Alicia.* "Arcadia, my friends are here to see you."

Arcadia: "Oh?"

Lance: "Nah, let's not do that thing where we change topics-" *He pointed at PKMY's back in confusion.* "Wat the flamin' fudge!"

Arcadia: "Heh." *She smirked and wiped tears off her cheeks, avoiding eye contact.*

Lance: "W-Wat?"

Arcadia: "Such a simple mind-"

Lance: "You-"

Holland: "Amy is empathic." *He quickly answered Lance's question to prevent an argument to occur.*

Lance: "Oh.." *He settled down and stared at her back with growing interest.*

Alicia: "A-Amy? Empathic?"

PKMY: "Ahem." *Her eye twitched.*

Holland: "I mean, PKMY."

Arcadia: *She looked at PKMY from an altered perspective and smiled, watching gas-like aura swirl around her.* "She's learning to channel and focus those powers."

Lance: "Kool." *He sighed under his breath, as if he didn't care.*

Alicia: "What does it do?"

Lance: "It's just where they can like feel what you feel or some crap."

Holland: "Ah-.." *He pulled an awkward face, glancing at Arcadia and PKMY.*

Arcadia: *She closed her eyes.* (Hit yourself.)

Lance: "Truth hurts-?" *He suddenly slapped himself across the face, causing him to gasp at his hand in betrayal.*

Holland: *He snickered, as he tried not to laugh.* (Sorry, Lance, but that was funny.)

Arcadia: (That's what it can do.) *She opened her eyes and looked at Alicia while making herself more comfortable on the wheelchair.*

Alicia: *She stood still overwhelmed with emotion.* "..."

Lance: *He grunted and rubbed his cheek, frowning with impatience.* "We're here to go to Valhalla."

Alicia: *She nodded her head.* "We've been asked by Madora, to see our comrades-"

PKMY: "Celest-"

Arcadia: "And Locki."

Lance: "Oi, stop that, it's freaky-" *He suddenly slapped himself across the cheek again.* "Wha-?"

PKMY: *She smirked with her eyes closed.* (Damn, sucks I can't learn how to do that-)

Lance: *He squealed like a child, staring at his hand.* "Why-?"

Arcadia: *She squinted her eyes, causing Lance to slap himself once again.* "...-"

Lance: "Gah-?!"

Alicia: "So, will you be able to help us? Please?"

Arcadia: *She silently looked at PKMY, staring at her in thought.* (PKMY's training.. Her level of raw, natural power-) "Fortunately for you two, PKMY no longer needs supervision in this part of her training."

PKMY: (Heh-)

Arcadia: "Come-" *She swivelled around and wheeled herself to another room, hidden behind a mat-like curtain.*

Holland: "Good luck you two." *He smiled and walked over to PKMY, watching Lance and Alicia awkwardly follow Arcadia across the room.*

Lance: "Thanks." *He stared ahead and mumbled to Holland, stepping into the next room.*

Alicia: "Th-Thank you-" *She walked past Holland and smiled in appreciation.*

PKMY: "Remember, confidence and concentration." *She grunted with her eyes closed, triggering a flashback of mud exploding in her face.*

Alicia: *She gasped in shock, as if PKMY's thoughts triggered a flashback.* (That time in the forest, when PKMY helped me learn Aqua Liquid-)

-

PKMY: *She flicked hair out of her face, wiping the water off her hands.* "Why did you lose concentration-?!" *She stepped forward and slipped on the mud, falling onto her back.*

Alicia: *She laughed, quickly covering her mouth.* "Are you okay-?"

PKMY: *She grunted in anger and glared at Alicia, noticing mud on her cheeks.* "You must have mud on your hands?"

Alicia: *She lowered her hands and noticed the mud which slowly dripped off her fingers.* (When I touched the ground.)

PKMY: "Your concentration was sloppy!"

Alicia: "Sloppy?" *She raised her arms, allowing PKMY to watch the mud slop off.*

*PKMY and Alicia stared at each other in silence before randomly and suddenly bursting into laughter.*

-

Alicia: "R-Right." *She looked down with a smile and walked off into the next room.*

PKMY: *She smiled in recollection, keeping her eyes closed.* (Being covered in mud.. I completely forgot about that, heh.)

Lance: *He looked across the room and noticed several silk-like mattresses on the floor.* "There're only beds in 'ere, aye."

Arcadia: "And your point?"

Lance: "Pssht, what, you want us to sleep or somethin'?" *He chuckled and looked behind him to Alicia.*

Arcadia: "Yes? Don't you want to enter Valhalla?"

Lance: "Aye?" *He pulled a feral face and glanced at Arcadia, as if she was stupid.*

Arcadia: "Sleeping is the key."

Lance: "Aha, and what, sneezing is the lock?"

Alicia: "Sleep?" *She spoke under her breath and looked up in thought as if she knew something.*

Arcadia: "Not many people know, why not tell your stupid boyfriend what you're thinking?"

Alicia: "W-What I'm thinking-?"

Lance: "Stupid?!"

Alicia: "I've heard distant rumours about a Diareamer, someone with the ability to walk across distant lands-"

Arcadia: *She sighed loudly, pointing to the silk-like mattresses in frustration.* "I grow tired of the same explanation, you two try and fall asleep and I'll take care of the rest."

Lance: *He stretched his back and took initiative, quickly resting on one of the beds.* (With all the fightin', and walkin', I was kinda tired anyways-) *He yawned and closed his eyes, placing his hands on his stomach.* (And goin' back home.)

Alicia: (I'm not really tired-) *She yawned, causing her to cover her mouth in shock.* (How-?)

Arcadia: (I'm sending the boy's feelings to her, so I only need one person to feel sleepy-) *She watched Alicia lay down next to Lance, quickly making herself comfortable.* (-In order for the whole party to fall asleep.)

Lance: *He started to snore and took deep breaths, before mumbling in his sleep.* "Lightning... Blast.."

Alicia: *She looked to her side and smiled at Lance, slowly closing her eyes.* (Why am I so sleepy?)

Arcadia: *She looked down to her lap, smiling with sadness.* (Ginger has been upset with me before, but not like this..)

----------

Alicia: *She woke up with a gasp and awkwardly stepped forward, noticing she stood on The Divine Path.* "W-Where are-?"

Arcadia: *She stepped forward, catching Lance and Alicia's attention.* "You are obviously staring at The Divine Path."

Lance: *He stared at the path's radiant glow.* "We're awake?"

Alicia: *She looked down and admired the land below.* "We're already here?"

Lance: "B-But we were just-" *He glanced at Arcadia, noticing she was standing up.*

Arcadia: "Yes, we're here, and it is my duty as a Diareamer to-" *She walked forward, firmly grabbing onto Lance and Alicia.*

Lance: "Where'd the crazy wheels go?!" *He motioned his arms in a wheelchair-like manner.*

Arcadia: "A Sacred Knight has no limitations." *She whispered under her breath and concentrated, causing the party to disappear in a swirl of golden light.*

----------

*Pickles, Brazza, Isaac and Dakota concentrated with their eyes shut and focused on glowing glyphs, which spiralled around their heads.*

Brazza: *He opened his eyes and smirked, swaying hair out of his face.* "My target's been located, hmph."

Pickles: *She slowly opened her eyes, frowning in deep thought.* (I've located mine, too-) *She slowly exhaled mist and watched the glyph around her head shatter away, glancing at Brazza.*

Dakota: "Unforgivable!" *She shouted and opened her eyes, causing the spiralling glyph to shatter into nothing.* "I found those fiends! Unforgivable!" *She frowned and licked her lips, swaying her long silver hair out of her face.*

Isaac: *He mumbled and the glyph spiralling around his head shattered, causing him to nervously open his eyes.* "I-I have located my target."

Brazza: "What now?"

Dakota: "Go after them of course!"

Pickles: (My target.. I tracked and pinpointed her location, but her signature suddenly disappeared.) *She brushed her hands through her green hair, frowning in deep thought.* (I have no choice but to terminate her-)

Isaac: "Once we kill our targets, the plan is to meet up?"

Brazza: "Actually, helping the closest captain would be better."

Dakota: "Yeah." *She groaned under her breath, chewing the blue strand of hair in the corner of her mouth.* "That sounds like an excellent plan."

Pickles: "Unlike the previous captains, we are Elementalists."

Isaac: "Y-Yeah." *He stuttered with confidence and punched his fists together, causing a loud boulder-like crumble to echo in the cave.*

Brazza: (As Elementalists, we have slighter better fighting attributes than Rostical Users. But in the end, it doesn't really matter-)

Dakota: "Let's begin our preparations and kill them!"

Isaac: "R-Right!"
Brazza: "Hmph." *He grunted, nodding his head in agreement.*
Pickles: "Naice." *She smirked, forming a fist in confidence.*

----------

Lance: *He watched the area warp past him at amazing speeds.* (This feels similar to a teleportation glyphy thingy, but it's not-?)

*Arcadia stepped out of a swirl of fading light, staring at an enormous castle-like structure.*

Arcadia: "It's my duty to send thou to your destination." *She carelessly let go of Lance and Alicia and started to walk towards the castle.*

Alicia: "Ah-" *She stepped back with a loss of balance and started to fall, catching Lance's attention.*

Lance: *He leant to the side and caught her with ease.* "Watch it, dopey bitch."

Alicia: "Th-Thank you." *She watched Lance help her forward with a smile, rubbing his arms as if it comforted her.*

Lance: *He ensured Alicia was on her feet before letting go.* "Oi-" *He stared at Arcadia's back and frowned.* "Wait."

Arcadia: "..." *She ignored Lance and continued to walk away.*

Celest: "Welcome back, Alicia." *Her voice caused Arcadia to pause on the spot.*

Arcadia: "Celest?" *She looked up, watching Celest float down from the sky.*

Celest: (Excellent work, Arcadia.) *She gently flapped her fluoro white wings and touched the ground, standing in a professional manner.*

Lance: "Oi, she's got wings too!-" *He stared at Celest in astonishment, watching her radiant wings of light burst into nothing.*

Locki: *He suddenly appeared in a flash of white light, catching Arcadia's attention.* "You are dismissed, Arcadia."

Arcadia: "Yes." *She nodded her head and closed her eyes, causing a golden swirl to warp around her.*

Alicia: "Th-Thank you, Arcadia-" *She smiled in appreciation, watching Arcadia disappear in a swirl of fading light.*

Arcadia: (Thy wonder what is so important about those two?)

-

Arcadia: *She thought to herself and woke up in the wheelchair.* "Thy can't tell if Lance is strong or not-?"

*Arcadia watched Lance and Alicia sleep on the silk-like beds, as her eyes reverted back into their normal colour.*

Arcadia: *She stared at Alicia with a left red-coloured eye and right hazel-coloured eye, watching sprinkling, glitter-like aura swirl around her pendant.* "-And she merely has Radiatons-"

----------

Celest: "What an unexpected surprise."

Alicia: *She looked at the castle, observing its imperial-like pillars, roof and structure.* "We're here because of Lance's mother."

Locki: "Oh, yes?"

Lance: "My mother, Kairi Lighten-"

Celest: *She froze in shock, staring at Lance with widening eyes.* "That name."

Locki: "Celest?"

Celest: "One of my friends who disappeared some time ago."

Locki: "That wouldn't be the same Kairi, the Remenistal User who was with the Elemental User?"

Celest: "Yes." *They mumbled to themselves, causing Lance to frown with impatience.*

Lance: "Arh, hello?"

Celest: *She coughed and stepped forward, as if nothing happened.* "What exactly are thou seeking?"

Lance: "My mother-, Kairi said to tell Celest.." *He paused, trying to recollect what Kairi said word by word.*

Celest: "Yes?"

Lance: "Umm, to use The Voice of On to remove Leon's seal." *He shook his head with emotion, shrugging his shoulders in confusion.*

Celest: (Leon? Kairi? Thy do not believe it...)

Locki: *He glanced at Celest, noticing her out of character facial expression.* "Ahem."

Celest: *She quickly regained her composure, looking at Alicia.* "Alicia."

Alicia: "Y-Yes-?"

Lance: "Oh, wat?! Good way to totally ignore me."

Celest: *She looked at Locki, nudging her head towards Lance.* "Locki?"

Locki: *He nodded his head in understanding and faced Lance.* (Celest has been wanting to do this for some time, now she finally has the opportunity.)

Alicia: "What's going on?"

Lance: "Question of the year, aye?!" *He grunted with frustration, due to the lack of response.*

Locki: "Lance, come with me."

Lance: "Huh? Why?" *He whined and pointed at Celest like a child, as if she was the one to give him answers.*

Celest: "Alicia, do you mind if we talk?"

Alicia: "O-Of course not."

Lance: "Oi?!"

Celest: *She walked up to Alicia with a smile, unintentionally ignoring Lance.* "Thy am pleased to hear so-"

Lance: "No, I'm here to see you-"

Alicia: *She stepped to the side, glancing at Lance.* "H-He's right-"

Celest: "We shall be leaving-"

Lance: "No, I don't want to separate-"

Celest: "Thy see." *She spoke in a stern voice and touched Alicia's shoulder, disappearing in a flash of white light.*

Lance: "Dammit." *He grunted with a slight frown, discreetly looking at Locki in the corner of his eye.*

Locki: "Lance. Let's take a walk?" *He motioned his arm across the vast amount of floating lands.*

Lance: (Why bother talkin' back? It's not like I get any answers when the story suddenly gets random and fast paced like this.)

Locki: "Lance?"

Lance: (I'll just go with the flow..) *He sighed and quietly nodded his head in a defeated manner.*

Locki: *He stepped to the side and faced the sun which shined brightly in the distance.* "To use The Voice of On, thou will need to enter your mind." *He started to walk in the direction of the light, causing his armour to shimmer with every step.*

Lance: "Huh-?" *He looked up in shock, quickly shaking his head in dismissal.*

Locki: *He stopped, looking over his shoulder to Lance.* "Thy said-"

Lance: "Whoa, slow down shit-a-tron, I need to talk to Celest."

Locki: "Do thou even know what about?"

Lance: "..."

Locki: "Hmm?"

Lance: *He looked away with a childish frown.* "... No."

Locki: "Uphold some sort of respect, or we won't be of any help."

Lance: *He grunted and gritted his teeth.* "S-Sorry..."

Locki: *He nodded his head in acceptance and started to walk away.* "So, from the quick information Arcadia told us, we will need to use The Voice of On."

Lance: *He looked confused and slowly followed Locki, staring at his back.* "Could you just tell me wat you mean? I'm tired of all these riddles, aye."

Locki: "When someone learns a new technique, Remenistal or Rostical, they go through what we call a personal trial."

Lance: "Why?"

Locki: "Only Celest remembers the trials induced by The Voice of On."

Lance: "Once again, why?" *He listened to their footsteps echo on the stone ground, as a gentle gust of wind blew past him.*

Locki: "That isn't explained, but thy personally believe-" *He paused with a wondrous smile and looked up, causing a circular white platform to light up under his feet.*

Lance: (Shit, shit, shit-) *He hastily grunted in thought, quickly stepping on the platform, watching it levitate off the ground.*

Locki: "It's because, The Voice of On's power is far too great for us to comprehend." *He watched the glyph rise past the higher levels of the castle-like structure.*

Lance: *He kept quiet, as he tried to understand what Locki meant.* "So, we go through some inner-trial when we learn new stuff?"

Locki: "Correct."

Lance: "When I learn stuff-" *He had flashbacks of feeling ill before using a new Rostical.* "But-?"

Locki: "If thou're unsure, ask as many questions as thou see fit. Thy would prefer that than thou making errors later down the track."

Lance: "Well, if we go through an inner-trial that we apparently can't remember, how does that happen in the few seconds of feelin' like crap to actually usin' the Rostickal?"

Locki: "Hard to grasp the idea, isn't it? All this happens instantaneously." *Warm sunlight shined on his holy armour, as the glyph continued to rise towards the top of the castle.*

Lance: *He stared at the puffy white clouds.* "Why bring this up?"

Locki: "Celest and thy are good friends, we've been companions for a very long time now."

Lance: (Good for you.) *He sighed in thought, rolling his eyes.*

Locki: "She even knew me the day thy acquired my celestial wings and eyes.. She has told me things she has not told anybody else."

Lance: "..." *He looked at Locki, pretending to understand what he was talking about.*

Locki: "Which is why thy can remove the seal myself."

Lance: "Oh!" *He gasped with realisation, slightly smirking at the thought.* "That's why you can help me?"

Locki: "Exactly."

Lance: "Rightio." *He sounded slightly confused, nodding his head in determination.*

*Shadows skimmed across the clouds and floating islands, as people flew through the sky.*

Lance: *He noticed the skimming shadows, causing him to look up in curiosity.* "By the way, how can people fly with wings? Isn't it a little unrealistic?"

Locki: *He chuckled at Lance's sheer stupidity.* "The wings are filled with Radiatons that slightly repel against the Astragons, which allow flight."

Lance: "Not the aura lookin' ones, the feathered ones-"

Locki: "They act in the very same manner. Some members of The Wise are even able to hover off the ground due to the sheer repel of Astragons."

Lance: "Oh, OK, fair enough." *He grunted in satisfaction, noticing the glyphic-like platform rise above the castle.* "Oi, we passed the castle."

Locki: (Thy better start taking action-) "Thou see up there?" *He pointed up into the distance, glancing at the highest floating island.*

Lance: *He squinted his eyes, staring at the floating island in confusion.* "Yea?"

Locki: "That is where thou'll be training."

Lance: "Train? I don't wanna train." *He spoke under his breath, slouching his shoulders.*

Locki: "Was it not obvious?"

Lance: "I'm already strong enough, aye!"

Locki: "Thou will need to do so, in order to get rid of the seal."

Lance: "Why is there a seal in the first place?" *He looked at his body, as if he was unsure where or what the seal was.*

Locki: "Thy don't know.."

Lance: "Well that didn't sound great." *He spoke in a sarcastic manner, noticing Locki's lost in thought face.*

Locki: "Due to the lack of knowledge of said seal, thy was not sure where to commence the training."

Lance: "Huh?"

Locki: "Thy had the option of The Astral Sanctum, The Glacial Castle, or at the peak of the divine kingdom we just passed."

*Locki mumbled in thought and pointed below, drawing Lance's attention to the castle.*

Lance: "Huh? Wat wat?" *He looked around, scratching his head as if he was lost.* "All I see are kool lookin' islands and waterfalls, I don't see any of these castles or kingdoms you speak of."

Locki: "Open your eyes then." *He stepped to the side, causing another golden glyph to activate in mid-air.*

Lance: "W-Wat are you-?"

Locki: *He stepped off the platform, causing it to fade underneath Lance's feet.* "..."

Lance: "G-Gah!-" *He jumped onto the next glyph and gasped in fright, watching the previous glyphic-like platform fade away.*

Locki: "Lance, we're going to the peak of the castle."

Lance: "You mean the one down there?" *He grunted in a condescending manner, staring at the castle below.*

Locki: "No-" *He watched the platform rise above the last floating island, slightly smirking with anticipation.*

Lance: "Then, wat castle-?" *He mumbled the rest of the sentence, as he stared at an enormous white and gold castle on the floating island.*

Locki: "This castle." *He noticed the glyphic platform stop at the edge of the island, causing him to step onto the grassy land.*

Lance: "Aha-" *He grunted in a childish manner, stepping on the land before Locki.*

Locki: (This boy is very troubling.) *He watched the golden glyph rotate behind him, before disintegrating into nothing.*

Lance: "So-?"

Locki: "Come." *He spoke in a stern manner, walking towards the castle.*

Lance: (This is awkward.) *He silently followed Locki and looked around, whistling with a carefree attitude.*

Locki: "Can thy ask thou something?"

Lance: *He stopped whistling and looked at Locki, walking slightly faster.* "Yea, wat is it?"

Locki: *He looked to his side at Lance and struggled to speak.* "Have you seen, Pepper?"

Lance: "No, I haven't, aye."

Locki: "Oh.. Okay."

Lance: *He looked up in thought, placing his hands on his head.* "When I think 'bout it, I haven't seen her in a while."

Locki: "Thy-" *He looked down and watched his boots slightly shine gold, as another materialising glyph spiralled underneath him.* "-Thy see.."

Lance: "Huh?" *He looked down in shock as the glyph spiralled up, levitating them into the air.* "Another glyph?!"

Locki: "... Yes?" *He looked at Lance in confusion, as if it was obvious there was another glyph.*

Lance: *He watched the glyph hover towards the massive castle, causing him to look at Locki, intrigued.* "Why you ask if I seen her?"

Locki: "That is not your concern." *He spoke in a deep voice and folded his arms, staring at the castle.*

Lance: "OK." *He coughed and looked away slightly intimidated.*

Locki: (Pepper, where are thou?)

Lance: *He observed the castle's magnificent structure in detail, as the platform continued to rise higher.* (It would be awesome if I could have a holiday here-)

*A flock of doves flew past the party at head level, causing Lance to gasp in shock like a child.*

Locki: *He coughed and placed his hand near his mouth, hiding his condescending smirk.* "We're almost there."

Lance: *He sniffed his finger and pretended to be cool, covering up his reaction.* "So... Wat's with all the platform thingys?" *He awkwardly pointed at the glyphic platform, glaring at the flock of doves in the distance.*

Locki: "For transportation?"

Lance: "Nah, I mean, like, why not just go whoosh-" *He swayed his hands around his head.* "-And teleport us straight there?"

Locki: "Would thou appreciate teleporting everyone everywhere? It's reckless to use power if it's not a requirement in reaching one's goal."

Lance: "But, we could be there now-?"

Locki: "Humph. Thy'm not wasting energy teleporting thou at your leisure because thou're too lazy to walk." *He grunted in a stern manner, causing Lance to stop.*

Lance: *He sighed, staring at the castle.* "Well, wat's so special up there?" *He pointed at the peak of the enormous castle as they hovered closer towards it.*

Locki: "A room filled with sacred glyphs, glyphs which channel one's mind and spirit."

Lance: "Channels it where?"

Locki: "It differs from one to the other, but its uses are quite vast."

Lance: "Aye?"

Locki: "Other than Celest using it as a water mirror to view the land below, thy use it to keep in touch with my inner-darkness."

Lance: "Why?"

Locki: "To keep my Radiatons at full strength, and if you say why, it's because of an event that happened in the past. One Sacred Knight lost his mind due to a Neuronic and Radiaton build up."

Lance: "Wat happened?"

Locki: "He ended up exploding into a ball of light, destroying several houses and homes."

Lance: (Whoa-) *He looked surprised, staring at Locki with widening eyes.* "Nah, I was just gonna say that houses are usually homes, but tomaytoe-tormartoh."

*The glyphic platform stopped at the top of the castle, cueing Lance to awkwardly step forward to keep balance.*

Locki: "Thy see." *He sounded annoyed and stepped off the glyphic platform onto the castle, walking towards a large divine-like entrance.*

*Strong gusts of wind blew Lance forward, followed by sparkles of light caused by the disintegrating glyph.*

Lance: *He flicked his swaying hair out of his face in a childish manner.* (This place is seriously awesome!)

*Lance chuckled in thought and turned around, admiring the unimaginable beauty below.*

Lance: *He deeply inhaled, staring at hundreds of floating islands across the sky.* (Even that flowery smell is awesome.. But I definitely wouldn't say that out loud though, aha.)

*The sounds of Locki's echoing footsteps drifted Lance's attention to the castle.*

Locki: *He walked into the quiet castle, listening to the distinctive changes to the sounds of his armour rattling.* (Once thy finish my current duties, thy will ask Celest about finding Pepper.)

Lance: *He inspected the castle, noticing Locki out of his sight.* "Oi! Wait for me!" *He shouted in a panicked manner, quickly running into the castle.*

Locki: *He walked up white, royal-like stone stairs, keeping a professional posture with every step.* "Thou know, thy'm quite curious to find out what this seal is about now." *He spoke as if he knew Lance could hear him.*

Lance: *He jumped over multiple steps, quickly catching up to Locki.* "Umm, yea me too, aye."

*Several women with feathered wings walked down the stairs, causing Locki to smile.*

Locki: "Greetings." *The women nodded their heads in respect, as they quietly stepped past them.*

Lance: *He awkwardly shuffled against the wall, closely avoiding their wings.* "I've been thinkin'-"

Locki: "Ouch?"

Lance: *He lowered his shoulders and sighed.* "Not you too?"

Locki: "Tomatoes are a hard thing to think about." *He stepped into a large cathedral-like room, looking at Lance.*

Lance: *He stopped next to Locki, noticing coloured light shine on the floor through a multi-coloured window.* (I get a churchy vibe here-)

Locki: "Thou see the divine pedestal over there?"

Lance: "Yea, I'm not blind." *He grunted in a rude manner, purposely staring at the pedestal.*

Locki: "Look into it." *He stood on the spot and stared at Lance, as if he was waiting for him to walk towards it.*

Lance: *He stepped forward and felt lines engraved on the polished stone ground, noticing they travelled up along the walls.* "..."

Locki: (The water is of unknown properties..)

Lance: "I guess that's my cue." *He rolled his eyes and started to walk to the pedestal.*

Locki: (Thy will monitor him just in case anything happens. When thy used this to acquire my Ougi, Celestrial Lancer, thy almost fell into a coma-)

Lance: *He stopped and stared at the pedestal, sighing in an unimpressed-like manner.* "Dude, I just see my reflection." *He watched his face warp in the ripples of the dark blue liquid.*

Locki: "It will react to your Neurons and Astragons.." (And memories.)

Lance: "Newgongs 'n' Astragongs, aye? I don't get it!"

Locki: "It will work soon, it's-" *His voice muffled near the end of his sentence, causing Lance to frown in confusion.*

Lance: "Wat?" *He stared at his warped reflection, trying to listen to what Locki was saying.*

Locki: "Thy.. Suppressed.. Power-, confusion-." *His words mumbled as if he spoke with a loss of reception.*

Lance: *He blew in frustration, looking to his side at Locki.* "Huh? He's gone? That's a bit rude-"

*Lance looked down to the pedestal, noticing it was gone.*

Lance: "Where-?" *He looked up, suddenly finding himself in a gold, Egyptian-like room.* "Umm, what?"

*Old Egyptian stone stairs suddenly moved like escalators across the ceiling, instantly catching Lance's attention.*

Lance: *He looked up and stared at the stairs in disbelief, watching streams of sand pour from the cracks.* "This is somethin' out of a mummy movie..."

*Lance quickly spun around and observed the area in detail.*

Lance: "Fire danced on long wooden torches which were attached to metal railings on the wall-" *He looked down, kicking the floor.* "Golden-square tiles patterned across the golden walls and floors."

*Lance silently looked to each side and listened to the sounds of grinding rock, coming from the moving stairs.*

Lance: "So, what the flyin' butt nuggets am I meant to do?"

?????: "Hehe." *A familiar sounding giggle echoed from a dark corridor.*

Lance: *He paused, staring at the dark corridor with uncertainty.* "Who's there?!"

?????: "Hee heehee."

Lance: (Well, I'm not one of those idiots who keep sayin', who's there and hello-)

?????: "Hehehe."

Lance: "So, I guess I'm meant to follow the freaky giggles?" *He sighed and started to run towards the dark corridor, avoiding the random streams of sand caused by the moving stairs.*

PKMY: *She flashstepped in front of Lance and shoved her hand in front of his face, causing him to awkwardly stop.* "There will be moving targets, prove to us you're of natural talent in Remenistal."

Lance: "Hey-"

PKMY: "Understood what we said?"

Lance: "What are ya talkin' 'bout?"

PKMY: *She sighed, placing a hand on her waist.* "We are not the woman you know of, this is merely a form you've interpreted as your instructor."

Lance: "Wateva, you crazy little red head." *He stuck out his tongue and raised his shoulder, waiting for PKMY to punch him.* "H-Huh?"

PKMY: "Enough games, we have more important stuff to do."

Lance: *He gasped, pointing at PKMY in shock.* "You're really not-"

PKMY: "We are pleased you have comprehended that."

Lance: (Alright-) *He paused, staring at PKMY with uncertainty.* (I think I need to pay more attention to what's goin' on.)

PKMY: "You've summoned us here, now listen."

Lance: (What have I got myself into now?) *He stood in a mature-like manner, giving PKMY his undivided attention.*

PKMY: "In order for us to do what you desire, you need to earn our respect."

Lance: *He gritted his teeth and hesitantly bowed to one knee.* "..."

PKMY: "Get up, attack the targets at sixty. Once you do that, you'll go on to the next." *She stepped away from Lance, cupping her hands behind her back.*

Lance: "Sixty what? Next what?"

PKMY: *She nudged her head past Lance, staring at the wall.* "You should focus your attention to other places-"

*A loud screech caught Lance's attention, causing PKMY to discreetly smirk to herself.*

Lance: "Shit, wat now?" *He grunted and turned around, noticing several lizard, fish-like Scoldrants crawling along the walls.* "Wat?!" *He looked back to PKMY, staring at her with anger-filled confusion.*

PKMY: "Umm, Lightning Blast?" *She pushed her hand forward, pretending to be Lance.*

Lance: "Tssk-" *He spun around and aimed towards the closest Scoldrant.* "LIGHTNING BLAST"

*A blast of lightning caused the surrounding Scoldrants to lower their heads in fright.*

PKMY: (Not many people can access this level of inner-self-) *She glanced at the detailed patterns on the walls and observed the flickering fire as Scoldrants moved past it.* (He has yet to know the advantages of using his strength here. He must go all out.)

Scoldrant: *It hissed, flicking out a long-forked tongue.* "Hisssskt." *It crawled along the wall and pounced towards Lance.*

Lance: *He ducked under the Scoldrant, glancing at his free hands in confusion.* (Man, I've got no weapon!)

*A serpent-like Scoldrant slithered out of the ground, opening its horse-like mouth.*

Lance: *He glanced at the serpent-like Scoldrant, pushing his hand towards it.* (LIGHTNING BLAST)

PKMY: *She watched a stream of lightning spark through the Scoldrant, causing it to disintegrate into nothing.* "...-"

*A cluster of spider-like Scoldrants crawled towards Lance.*

Lance: *He awkwardly leant back, facing the cluster of spider-like Scoldrants.* "THUNDER BOOM" *He spread his arms and clapped his hands, knocking the Scoldrants back by a wave of sound.*

PKMY: *She looked behind Lance, watching a human, ape-like Scoldrant materialise behind him.* "Hmm?"

Scoldrant: "Argh and screech!" *It laughed like an ape and charged towards Lance with dagger-sized claws.*

Lance: "LIGHTNING BLAST" *He turned around and watched a sphere of light grow in his palm, before blasting a stream of lightning into the Scoldrant.*

Scoldrant: "Pain and death!" *It laughed like an ape and watched the lightning violently shoot out of its back, before disintegrating into nothing.*

Lance: "Gah-" *He spun around without a moment's hesitation, focusing his attention to a cluster of snake-like Scoldrants.* "LIGHTNING PULSE" *He swayed forward in a fluid manner and clapped his hands in front, blasting a ring of blue lightning which rumbled like thunder towards the cluster of snake-like Scoldrants.*

PKMY: *She slightly smirked, watching the Scoldrants violently twitch in the flashes of blue, vein-like lightning.* (The poor boy is limited to one element, yet he doesn't allow that to be a weakness.)

Lance: "LIGHTNING BLAST" *A blast of lightning sparked between several bat-like Scoldrants in the air, causing them to spiral downwards.*

Scoldrant: *A small squid-like Scoldrant fell from the ceiling, squirting out a stream of black water.* "AQUA LIQUID-"

Lance: "THUNDER BOOM" *He clapped his hands, causing the stream of water to blow away in the loud thunder-like rumbles.*

PKMY: (Let's see shortly when I adjust his next opponents' elemental affinity immunity.)

Scoldrant: "Tskk-t-t-tsss." *A huge fish-like Scoldrant with scaly legs expanded and blew out a cannon of water.* "HYDRO CANNON"

Lance: "Shit- THUNDER BOOM" *He pushed forward and the water exploded just in front of him.*

PKMY: *She held her hand out to her side, watching the water spray into her palm.* (He's stupid, but smart at the same time. This may be just as interesting as Celest's first visit.)

Lance: "Oh yea, you stupid puffer fish! LIGHTNING BLAST" *He pointed at the Scoldrant and a stream of lightning blasted through the Scoldrant, hitting the wall behind it.*

Scoldrant: "Tss-" *It violently twitched with an expanding body, ignoring the wave of flames which pulsed around the lightning on the wall.*

Lance: *He lowered his arm and watched the Scoldrant disintegrate into nothing, noticing the flames on the wall.* "Nice! That hasn't happened before!"

*Lance smirked and quickly looked serious, as five Scoldrants leapt from the ceiling directly towards him.*

Lance: *He looked up and gritted his teeth, frowning with anticipation.* (Dammit!-)

PKMY: *She watched the Scoldrants fall on top of Lance, purposely piling up on each other.* (What's he going to do?)

Lance: "THUNDER BOOM" *A loud thunder rumbled followed by a wave of vibrations, which could be felt in the air.*

PKMY: "Hmm?" *She grunted with an unimpressed facial expression.* "Was that it-?"

Lance: "Get, off!" *He shouted, as the thunder knocked all the Scoldrants at different angles away from him.*

Scoldrant: *It hit the floor and tumbled across the ground before slamming into the wall.* "G-Bharh-"

PKMY: *She casually stepped to the side with an emotionless face as a Scoldrant tumbled past her, hitting the wall behind her.* "Hmph."

Lance: *He opened and closed his fists, frowning in excitement.* (I'm not even tired yet and my hands feel fine, my fingers usually get numb by now.)

*Lance smirked and looked up, pointing towards another swarm of Scoldrants with owl-like wings.*

Lance: "THUNDER BOOM-" *His eyes widened and his arms moved on their own accord.* "Huh?"

*A white glyphic shield grew from Lance's arm and spiralled, expanding in front of him.*

Lance: *He stared at the glyph in front of his arm, causing him to gasp in shock.* (It kinda feels like one of them medieval shields that clip onto your arm-)

Scoldrant: "Kiiiii." *It flapped its owl-like wings and hooted visible rings of sound, hitting the shield.*

Lance: "Crap-" *His arm wobbled as the shield withstood the attack, noticing it rumble like thunder with every hit.*

PKMY: *She smirked once more.* (His Remenistal just levelled to the next stage.)

Lance: *His face was bright due to the glyph.* "Wat the-?" *He lowered his arm, causing the shield to disintegrate away.*

Scoldrant: *It slithered along the ground and opened its mouth at Lance.* "Tskccss."

Lance: (The shield thingy was kool, but I want to use my original Thunder Boom-) "THUNDER BOOM" *He pushed forward and a white glyph spread from his arm, acting as a shield.*

Scoldrant: "Tckss." *It jabbed its face towards Lance at blinding speeds.*

Lance: "Where-?" *He lost sight of the Scoldrant's attack and the shield suddenly flashed, causing a slight thunder to echo in response.*

*Lance looked to the side in shock, watching the Scoldrant flip backwards onto the floor.*

Lance: "H-Huh? Kool."

PKMY: (He's a very quick learner.) *She snapped her fingers and all the Scoldrants vanished except for one made of rock.*

Lance: *He looked around in disorientation, noticing the rock Scoldrant.* "One left? Too easy." *He moved forward, causing the shield to disintegrate.* "LIGHTNING BL-"

Scoldrant: *It held its hands, causing its arms to merge together.* "Kra-" *It suddenly shot a ball of rock in a cannon-like fashion, which flew past Lance's head and violently exploded the wall behind him.*

Lance: "Shi-" *He looked over his shoulder, staring at the damage with widening eyes.*

Scoldrant: "Kra!" *Another rock fired out of its arms like a cannon.*

Lance: "THUNDER BOOM" *He raised his arm and the white glyph expanded in front of him.* "Krr-" *Thunder rumbled, as the shield blocked the rock.*

PKMY: (He already incorporated the new Remenistal's form. Only experienced Remenistal Users can distinguish, or even use both versions of the Remenistal.)

Lance: *He watched the rock crumble to pieces, noticing his shield in perfect condition.* "Ha! You're nothin'."

Scoldrant: *It growled, as if it could understand Lance's taunts.* "Krrarrh." *It clustered its body together and formed a ball, catching Lance's attention.*

Lance: *He looked at his palm, tightening his fingers.* (It's been a while since I've actually fought somethin'-)

Scoldrant: "Kra." *It started to spin at incredible speeds, causing the ground to spark behind it.*

PKMY: "We don't do this often, but here's a tip. Run."

Lance: "Wateva, it's just a spinnin' boulder now!" *He straightened his arm and pushed forward, blasting a stream of lightning towards the ball of rock.* "LIGHTNING BLAST"

Scoldrant: *It rolled towards Lance and hit the stream of lightning causing loose strings of electricity to spark around it.* "Kra!"

Lance: "Dirty shit nuggets!-"

PKMY: "Told you-"

Lance: "It didn't!-" *He grunted with widening eyes and enthusiastically jumped to the side, barely avoiding the Scoldrant's charge.*

Scoldrant: "Krahh!" *It violently smashed into the wall, causing deep cracks to form around it.*

Lance: *He looked alert and quickly stood up, standing in a battle-ready pose.* "Tssk."

Scoldrant: "Grharh." *It slowly rolled away from the wall, repositioning itself towards Lance.*

PKMY: *She watched the boulder roll on the spot and started to spin at fast speeds.* (Why isn't he running-?)

Lance: *He stared at the dark corridor and hesitated, noticing sparks flash under the boulder-like Scoldrant.* "Wateva." *He spoke on a high note and charged towards the corridor, noticing the lack of width between the walls.* "It won't get me now-"

Scoldrant: "G-Gharh!"

Lance: "Wat?!" *He looked behind him and noticed the Scoldrant rolling down the corridor after him.* "What, is this some stupid adventure movie or somethin'?!" *He squealed, as he continued to run down.*

?????: "Hiyarh!"

Lance: *He reached the end of the corridor and ducked, as a green mallet swung towards his face.* "Crap!-" *He rolled forward and tumbled across the ground.*

?????: "Herh-?" *The mallet smashed the boulder into pebbles.* "Oh, I missed."

Lance: *He stared at the short woman.* (She just smashed that Scoldrant into nothin'!) "Thanks for that, who are you?"

?????: "Mindy, forgot me already?" *She rested the mallet over her shoulder and faced Lance.*

Lance: "Dimny?" *He looked up in thought and frowned in recollection.*

Mindy: "It's Mindy." *She frowned with an evil-like smirk.* "And don't thank me, that was meant for you."

Lance: "Aye?" *He stood up and clicked his fingers, causing static to swivel around his fingertips.* "I don't remember ya, sorry."

Mindy: "I'm the first captain you encountered, and the first enemy to make you feel true pain." *Her words triggered a flashback of Lance's ribs breaking as she hit him with her mallet.*

Lance: *He gasped in recollection, touching his chest in shock.* "Ain't you dead? Wat are you doin' here?"

Mindy: "To get revenge." *She smirked evil-like, as she dangled the mallet to her side in one hand.*

Lance: "Bring it!"

Mindy: *She flicked her hand and threw the mallet up.* "My pleasure." *She caught the mallet in mid-air and charged at Lance, smirking with confidence.*

Lance: (I've watched Pepper fight, there are only a few ways people can swing a mallet-)

Mindy: *She ran into striking distance and spun her body, grabbing the mallet with both hands.* "Hah!" *She quickly smashed the mallet in front of Lance who instantly ducked.*

Lance: *His hair blew to one side, due to the force of Mindy's swing.* "Sh-Shit-" *He watched Mindy awkwardly spiral to the ground, as if she wasn't expecting him to dodge the attack.*

Mindy: "H-Huh?" *She hit the ground with her mallet and awkwardly leant forward in shock.*

Lance: "Too bad for you, I've gotten stronger." *He stood up with confidence, sniffing his finger.*

Mindy: "I-I missed?" *She looked at Lance, keeping her awkward hunched over posture.* "What did you say?"

Lance: *He straightened his arm at Mindy's head, glaring at her with an emotionless face.* "LIGHTNING BLAST"

*A stream of lightning hit Mindy in the face, causing her to drop her mallet in pain.*

PKMY: *She slowly walked into the room from the dark corridor.* "Lightning won't work."

Lance: "Wateva, don't need your advice-" *He grunted in a condescending manner and lowered his arm, watching the lightning violently spark against Mindy's face.*

Mindy: *She dropped to her knees, instinctively trying to wave the sparks of lightning out of her face.* "K-K-"

Lance: "Aha, see? I just owned her-"

Mindy: *She giggled in pain and shook her head, slowly standing up unaffected by Lance's Rostical.* "Ouch."

Lance: (Wat the? How could she get up with ease?!)

Mindy: *She wiped her mouth with her arm and smirked, picking up the mallet.* "My turn."

Lance: *He stepped back intimidated, bracing himself with anger.* "DRAGON'S BREATH" *He waved his arms, causing static to scatter on either side and he jumped on one foot.*

Mindy: "What are you-?"

Lance: "Take this!" *He punched forward and a vortex of red lightning hit Mindy directly on the face.*

Mindy: "Ouch, it hurts!" *Her armour rattled, as the lightning generated a wind-like force.*

Lance: *He half smirked, focusing his attention on the vortex of lightning.* "See-"

Mindy: *She grinned and shook her head, unaffected by the powerful vortex of lightning.* "Joking."

PKMY: "You better watch out, lightning doesn't affect her."

Mindy: *She glanced at PKMY and giggled, causing Lance to lower his arms in shock.* "Yes-sir-ee."

Lance: "Wat the flamin'-?" *He stood on the spot, staring at Mindy in a dumbfounded manner.* (Lightning doesn't affect her.)

Mindy: *She stepped forward in confidence, watching the red lightning spark away.* "That was fun." *She slowly walked towards Lance knowing he couldn't hurt her.*

Lance: (I only know lightning-)

Mindy: "How should I kill you? Smash your skull in on itself?" *She spoke with a happy tone and slammed the mallet on the ground, cracking the floor.* "Or should I use an Azure Burst?"

Lance: *He slowly stepped back, countering Mindy's progressive steps.* (I only know lightning, and I don't have a sword!)

Mindy: "I got it! I'll break your legs by the knees and crush your face in!"

Lance: (Lightning Blast, Pulse, Breath... Boom... Only-) *He paused with widening eyes, as if he remembered something.*

Mindy: *She swayed the mallet above her head, readying herself to kill Lance.* "Bye-"

Lance: "NIGHTSHADE" *He straightened his arm and pushed forward, blasting a stream of black lightning towards Mindy.*

Mindy: *Her eyes widened and she gripped the mallet in her hand, quickly somersaulting to the side.* "Hah." *She gasped in desperation, closely avoiding the lightning.*

PKMY: *She stood near the wall with her arms folded, showing an instance of interest.* (That appeared like lightning, but it wasn't the affinity, even Mindy could tell that. Does he possess Shadiagenicons?)

Lance: (Nightshade is the only non-lightning Rostickal I've got-)

Mindy: "Take this." *She quickly regained her composure and ran into striking distance, raising the mallet behind her.* "Gone!" *She swung the mallet at high speeds and the mallet suddenly repelled back out of her hand.* "H-Huh?"

Lance: *He stared at Mindy from behind a white glyph, which rumbled like thunder.* "That was close."

Mindy: *She observed Lance's face with a dropping jaw, listening to the rumbling sounds of her mallet hitting the ground behind her.* (He, looks serious-)

Lance: "NIGHTSHADE"

PKMY: *She closed her eyes, mumbling in thought.* (This would be too easy for him, we need to amp the difficulty-)

Mindy: *Her face filled with fear, like it did when Alicia used her Rostical.* "N-No-" *She gasped to herself, triggering vivid flashbacks of Alicia's Icicle Edge.*

Lance: "Yea-" *He blasted a stream of black lightning into Mindy's face, watching it flash behind her.*

Mindy: "Oof-" *She bent forward with a loss of breath, as the sparks puffed like shadow into nothing.*

Lance: *He smiled, watching black static puff into smoke around his hand.* (Wat she said before was right, I was really scared of her back then-)

Mindy: *She stood up straight and looked shocked, gently touching her body surprised.* "Ha!"

Lance: "Wat!" *He spoke in disbelief, looking straight at PKMY for assistance.* "Why didn't it work?"

PKMY: "Her Remenistal defence has tripled in magnitude, you need to somehow rise your Remenistal's power."

Lance: "How am I meant to do that?!"

PKMY: *She shrugged her shoulders.* "Not sure, how else would you boost your Remenistal?"

Lance: "For a teacher, you're really lousy!"

PKMY: "Heh." *She nudged her head to Mindy who was in striking distance to Lance.*

Lance: "Oh shi-" *He stepped back surprised, as a white shield expanded from his arm.*

Mindy: *She looked annoyed and stared at the shield, as her mallet glowed red.* (His shield is strong-) "Shattering Stones."

Lance: *He inhaled with fear and straightened his arm, causing the glyphic shield to spiral in front of his hand.* "NIGHTSHADE" *He pushed forward, causing a stream of black lightning to blast through the shield towards Mindy.*

Mindy: *She swayed to the side, easily avoiding the stream of lightning which puffed into smoke.* "Missed-"

Lance: "NIGHTSHADE"

Mindy: *She swung the mallet across, deflecting the Rostical to the side.* "Want to try again-?"

Lance: "NIGHTSHADE"

Mindy: *She stopped and hit the lightning away with her mallet, taking another step closer.* "No use.."

Lance: "No!" (How can I boost the power?!) *He frowned with desperation, purposely recalling his times with Millard and PKMY.*

Mindy: "Now, you're mine." *She raised the mallet, watching it glow red.*

Lance: (Come on, how can I power it up?!) *He shouted in thought, completely ignoring his surroundings.*

PKMY: *She looked at her hand surprised, watching her fingers twitch.* (My entity is here, yet my power, he's calling out for-)

Lance: (The words.) *He touched his throat in a sickly manner, glaring at Mindy with a change of attitude.*

Mindy: "Shattering Stones." *She swayed to the side and swung the mallet, easily smashing the glyphic shield with ease.*

Lance: (The words, I get it now!-)

Mindy: "Ougi." *She spoke under her breath and stepped back, holding each end of the mallet.*

Lance: *He frowned with anticipation, as if he didn't care what Mindy said.* "..."

PKMY: (He's gathering Neurons?)

Mindy: *She clapped her hands, causing the mallet to crush into nothing.* "Grounding Mallet."

Lance: "Where'd the mallet go?"

Mindy: *She motioned her hands as if she held the mallet and watched aura swirl in between her fingers, forming into a mallet.* "..."

PKMY: (Roharnia-based Ougis are dangerous once mastered, simply due to their complexity.)

Mindy: *She watched the mallet-like aura grow five times her size, causing her to hysterically chuckle in excitement.* "Hah harh!" *She slammed the aura mallet on top of Lance, watching the ground shatter around it.*

Lance: *He appeared several feet away, staring at Mindy with an emotionless face.* "..."

Mindy: *She gritted her teeth, watching the aura swirl back in her hands.* "Now your face!-"

Lance: *He looked at his palms, slightly smirking in a nervous manner.* "There's a spark in no time, let your colours burst and shine, allow your existence to fade, NIGHTSHADE"

*Lance straightened both arms and a ball of darkness grew in between his hands, catching PKMY's attention.*

PKMY: "Mindy, you better watch out."

Mindy: "I'll be fine." *She shouted, as the aura grew in size once more.*

Lance: "Harh." *He pushed forward and blasted a stream of black lightning which was double the size of Mindy's body towards her.*

Mindy: "How-?!"

Lance: *He watched the lightning smashed into her body, causing the aura-based mallet to swirl into nothing.* (This drainy pain-like feelin' I get, it's similar to when I used Dragon's Breath for the first time-)

Mindy: "Arhhhhhh." *She screamed in pain, listening to her own echoing screeches.*

Lance: *He leant forward, as the lightning disintegrated into a thick stream of shadow.* "Whoa-"

Mindy: "..." *Her body collapsed to the ground and faded away.*

Lance: *He looked at his hands in shock, mumbling to himself in astonishment.* "That was also the size of my Dragon's Breath."

PKMY: "Not bad, you successfully defeated her, we are slightly impressed."

Lance: "Well, I'm glad you're impressed." *He rolled his eyes.* "I mean, you lot be impressed."

PKMY: "Now you can only use your Ougi."

Lance: (So this thing knows I've got an Owgee.) "Don't I get to rest?"

PKMY: "Are you tired?"

Lance: "Well, no. I just want to know wat's goin' on-"

PKMY: *She clicked her fingers.* "Haven't you learnt from previous times? Keep your attention to your opponent."

Lance: "She faded away. There's no one-"

?????: "Hello." *She reached over her shoulder and pulled her arm forward, causing sparks to scatter.*

Lance: *He stared at a young woman dressed in pink-coloured armour and hair.* "Who are-?"

Wendy: "Wendy!"

Lance: "U-Umm.." *He paused, as if he couldn't remember who she was.*

Wendy: "So-" *She spoke in disgust and pointed a large bow at Lance, squinting one eye to aim.*

Lance: "So..?"

Wendy: "I will get revenge on you." *She whispered under her breath, pulling the string back.*

Lance: *He stepped to the side and stared at Wendy in confusion.* (Despite not gettin' any answers at all from PKMY or whatever it is-) "I guess I'll just listen to what she has to say.." *He lowered his head and mumbled.* "Ougi."

PKMY: (Heh.)

Wendy: *She gasped and withdrew the bow, looking to each side in suspense.* (An Ougi? Where?)

Lance: "Blasted shit nuggets-" *He tightened his left arm and formed a fist, raising it to the side of his face.* "Subzero Volt." *He straightened his right arm, opening his hand at Wendy.* (I've got this-)

Wendy: "What?" *She noticed fog slowly expel from Lance's fingertips, watching it drift towards her.*

Lance: (When I think about it, I haven't used my Owgee very often-)

Wendy: "Harh-" *She spun around and pulled the string, firing an arrow at the mist, causing Lance's right arm to spasm in response.*

Lance: *His eye twitched with concentration, as the arrow broke the fog's shape.* "..."

PKMY: (The boy has a very complex Ougi.) "Your manipulation is far too weak, someone with a wind affinity could easily blow away that slow-moving mist or fog."

Lance: *He ignored PKMY, frowning in thought.* (Shut up and let me concentrate-) *He swayed his arm, causing the fog to move faster.*

Wendy: (From my sister's memory, despite being a long-ranged user, it will be better to fight mid-ranged.)

Lance: (Now, if I move my left hand, it shoots the-) *He moved his wrist and a bolt of fluoro blue lightning shot out of the fog and past Wendy.* "Why did it miss?!"

PKMY: "Because she moved the fog."

Wendy: "With my arrow, remember?!" *She ran towards Lance with a smile, pulling the string back.*

Lance: "THUNDER BOOM" *He pushed his right hand forward and nothing happened, causing him to look worried.*

PKMY: "You can only use your Ougi."

Lance: "No fair, this is my inner-self, I should be able to do what I want!" *He hopped backwards and moved his wrist, causing more bolts of blue lightning to shoot past Wendy.*

Wendy: *She jumped around the bolts of lightning and flashstepped directly in front of Lance.* "Pulse Shot." *Her body glowed a shade of blue.*

Lance: *He waved his right arm in a circular motion and threw his hand into the air.* "How about this?!"

*The fog circled around Wendy and bolts of lightning sparked at every angle.*

Wendy: *She flashstepped into the air and spiralled backwards, landing outside the ring of fog.* "Tssk, it got me a little." *She looked at her shoulder, noticing it was burnt with charcoal under a layer of ice.*

Lance: "It would be good if Ougis had different levels, I'm growin' tired of usin' the same move."

PKMY: *She shrugged her shoulders, effectively hiding her smirk from Lance.* "It's your Ougi."

Lance: *He swayed his right arm which controlled the fog.* (I've managed to boost the speed of the mist, but-) *He flicked his wrist and bolts of lightning shot towards Wendy.*

Wendy: "Pestering me with your lightning!" *She flashstepped several feet away and fired an arrow towards Lance.*

Lance: *His eyes widened as he quickly leant to one side, listening to the arrow's piercing sound as it barely missed his head.* "..."

Wendy: "Missed!"

Lance: (That was close!) *He ignored the fog and focused more attention on Wendy.* (I somehow need more lightnin'-)

PKMY: "This is boring me, you've got several hours to master your Ougi."

Lance: "Wat?! Hours?!"

PKMY: "Yes, so?" *She turned around and vanished.*

Wendy: "Hey, your opponent is here!" *She pulled the string back and aimed for Lance, ignoring the waves of fog around her.*

----------

Locki: *He watched Lance stare into the pedestal in a trance-like state.* (He's been staring at it for some time now.)

*A dozen people in dark robes flashstepped around Locki, catching his attention with widening eyes.*

Locki: "Th-The Wise." *He spoke in shock, quickly bowing to one knee.*

The Wise: *A woman figure stepped forward.* "Rise, you are part of The Wise now."

Locki: "Y-Yes." *He stood up, looking at each member of The Wise in respect.* "What business brings you all here?"

The Wise: "We want you to check The Philosopher's Heart."

Locki: "Me?" *He pointed at himself in confusion.*

The Wise: "Desperate times call for desperate measures, we need to see if it reacts to any of The Sacred Knights."

Locki: "But I'm no longer-"

The Wise: "Even though thou are now a member of The Wise, thou're still currently classed as a Sacred Knight."

Locki: (Until the new generation has been selected to take my place.) *He nodded his head in understanding.*

The Wise: *A man figure folded his arms, coughing to catch Locki's attention.* "Thou don't mind?"

Locki: "O-Of course not, thy will go as soon as possible."

The Wise: *A tall figure turned away.* "Let us know immediately."

Locki: "Of course."

*The Wise flashstepped out of the cathedral appearing room, leaving behind gentle gusts of wind.*

Locki: *He smiled, looking up to the coloured glass.* (Thy'll finally get to see what it looks like.)

----------

PKMY: *She faded into the room and noticed Lance lying on the floor.* ".. He.. Died?"

Lance: "Nope."

PKMY: *She leant back surprised and walked towards him, inspecting the room in a curious manner.* "Where is your opponent?"

Lance: *He pointed up to the golden ceiling.* "Up there."

PKMY: *She looked up and stared at jarred ice surrounding a ring of charcoal with widening eyes.* (What happened?!)

Lance: "I'm guessin' you wanna know what happened?" *He grunted, as he leant up and looked at PKMY.*

PKMY: "Please."

Lance: "It was actually your words that helped me out."

PKMY: "Please explain?"

Lance: "When you said it was my Owgee, well, you were right, it's my Owgee.. So, I didn't know why I couldn't control it the way I wanted to."

PKMY: "Show me."

Lance: "Nah-"

PKMY: *She clicked her fingers and Wendy suddenly appeared before Lance.* "Now."

Wendy: "I won't go easy." *She pulled the string back.*

Lance: "Wat?! No fair! You can't just snap your fingers then bam, everythin' is the way you want-" *An arrow slashed Lance across his shoulder, causing him to jump up on his feet.* (Crap.)

PKMY: "We're waiting?"

Lance: "Ougi."

PKMY: *She slightly smirked.* (I've dealt with much more difficult people than you.)

Wendy: *She stood back and braced herself.* (I won't let him get me.)

Lance: "Blasted shit nuggets, Subzero Volt." *He motioned his right hand around Wendy, causing the fog to move at high speeds around her.*

PKMY: (His fog, it's moved at least five times the speed it originally was!)

Lance: *He frowned with concentration.* "Take this." *He flicked his wrist and blue bolts sparked around her.*

Wendy: *She jumped high into the air and aimed downwards, pulling the string back.* "No! You take this."

PKMY: (Although the mist's speed dramatically increased, she was still able to dodge-)

Lance: "Cloud-nine Volt." *He jumped back and withdrew his right arm, causing the fog to spiral in front of him.*

PKMY: "Eh?"

Wendy: *She gritted her teeth and struggled to aim the arrow.* (The mist formed a wall, I can't see where he is-)

Lance: "Hiyarh." *He pushed forward with both arms and a barrage of blue lightning bolts flared out of the fog.*

Wendy: (He's waiting for me to descend into those lightning strikes!)

PKMY: "Same mechanics as his normal Ougi, yet it slightly variates for different battle effects."

Wendy: *She looked down at the thunderstorm appearing attack.* (I will shoot my arrow through the mist and hopefully this will-) "-Hit him!"

*Wendy fired the arrow towards the mist and watched suddenly burst into flames, before freezing into an ice shard.*

Wendy: "Damn-" (It didn't even reach the mist!)

PKMY: (The raw amount of Neurons he pours into the lightning is astonishing-)

Lance: (My favourite part-) "Zero-volt Blender." *He wobbled both wrists and swayed both his arms, motioning the fog directly towards Wendy.*

Wendy: *She watched the fog swirl towards her.* (I can't flashstep in mid-air-) *She aimed the bow downwards and fired an arrow at the ground, causing her to blast back onto the ceiling.*

PKMY: *She watched the fog hit the roof, as Wendy flashstepped before impact.* (He's using the fog to attack? But his lightning is the damaging aspect of his-)

*Blue lightning scattered like veins along the roof, freezing zigzagged lines from the fog.*

Lance: *He smirked, as he looked to his side.* "I kinda feel where you're gonna flashstep-" *He swirled both arms towards vacant space.*

Wendy: *She appeared near Lance's side, readying herself to release the string.* "I'm too quick-" *The fog crashed directly on top of her, causing blue lightning to static around the fog.*

Lance: "..." *He slightly leant back and squinted his eyes, as the bright blue lightning flowed through Wendy's body.*

*The fog thickened, as it continued to crash on top of Wendy.*

PKMY: (He condensed the lightning into the fog and used it as a weapon, this boy.)

Wendy: "Kah.. Ck." *She dropped the bow and her eyes rolled back, as she lost consciousness.*

PKMY: (Remarkable how slightly changing the way his Ougi works, he's able to effectively use it in different ways.)

Lance: *He lowered his arms and sighed.* "Ya know, I'm not even tired.. And thanks."

PKMY: *The fog disappeared, revealing Wendy frozen in mid-sized chunks of ice.* "Thank you for what?"

Lance: "Well, if you didn't put the idea in my head, I wouldn't have manipulated my Owgee thingy." *He wiped his nose, sniffing his finger in a smug-like manner.*

PKMY: "We are slightly impressed, but we've got one more test for you. Upon completion, you would have proven that you deserve-"

Lance: "Stop talkin' and lemme at 'em." *He looked around the room full of confidence.*

PKMY: "You have to use a powerful attack, as one can't be defeated without the other."

Lance: "Wat does that mean?"

PKMY: "..." *She clicked her fingers, causing Wendy and Mindy to appear before Lance.*

Lance: "Two... Seriously?"

Wendy: "I'll make sure my aiming is at one hundred percent!" *She smirked and reached behind her back.*

Mindy: *She pointed her mallet at Lance, frowning with determination.* "I will win-"

Lance: "You've said that so many times it's gotten borin'!"

Wendy: *She tightened her hand, readying to release her bow.* "You!-"

Lance: "You're mine, I'm gone, wateva." *He grunted, as sparks of electricity swirled around his hands.* "LIGHTNING BLAST" *He straightened his arm towards Wendy and a blast of lightning struck her through the head.*

Wendy: "Kyah-" *Her eyes rolled back, as she fell back onto the floor motionless.*

PKMY: "Hmm?" (He must be full of confidence, either that, or he wants to end things quickly.)

Mindy: "Sister!"

Wendy: *Her body twitched and she slowly stood back up.* "Ouch."

Mindy: "Ha harh!" *She laughed in Lance's face, facing him with growing confidence.*

Lance: *He stepped back in shock.* "W-Wat!"

PKMY: "At the same time."

Lance: *He started to grind his teeth, forming a fist in thought.* (I needa use somethin' big, like-) "Lightning strike both sides-" *He flapped his arms downwards, causing lightning to scatter on both sides.*

Wendy: *She noticed the thickness of the lightning.* (He's gathered a lot of Neurons in this Rostical!-) "Mindy, stop him!" *Sparks scattered from her back, as she aimed the bow at Lance.*

Mindy: "Got it-"

Lance: "Flashing and flowing, call upon the secrets, summon the beast of roaring thunder-"

Mindy: "No you don't!-" *She sprinted towards Lance, as her body glowed a shade of blue.* "Shattering Stones-"

Lance: "DRAGON'S BREATH" *He jumped on one foot and punched the air, causing a vortex of green lightning to rumble towards the sisters.*

Mindy: "Green?!"
Wendy: "Mindy!-"

PKMY: *She covered her face, as a bright green light blinded her.* (We don't believe he's realised how much stronger he's become in here.)

Lance: "..." *He watched the lightning flare through the sisters, watching them fall to the ground in a synchronised-like manner.*

PKMY: *She watched the lightning flash away, observing Lance's facial expressions.* (We're curious to know what his drive is-)

Lance: "Done." *He lowered his arm, shaking his hand in relief.*

PKMY: *He paused and smirked, catching Lance's attention.* "... Or is it?"

Lance: "Aye?"

PKMY: "..." *She nudged her head downwards, causing Lance to look down.*

Mindy: "Ah, that-" *She shook her head, ignoring the rising steam around her caused by the lightning.* "That h-hurt."

Wendy: *She stood up and dropped the bow on the floor, watching steam rise off the ground around her.* "Our turn?"

Mindy: "Yes." *She threw the mallet away and stood next to Wendy.*

Lance: "How can they be all fine 'n' dandy?"

PKMY: "Arrogance."

Lance: "Nah! It's a fact, 'cause my lightnin' even caused the ground to steam!"

PKMY: "..."

Wendy and Mindy: "Hi-Ougi."

Lance: "Oh, come on." *He whined and focused his attention on the sisters, cautiously stepping back.*

Wendy and Mindy: "Sisters come together and unite the bonds by birth, fast and swift as an arrow, powerful and sturdy as a hammer, PROWESS STAMPEDE"

Lance: *He watched them stand side by side, getting themselves ready.* (Sittin' here waitin' for them to attack really annoys me, but what else can you do?)

Wendy and Mindy: *They pointed their arms towards Lance and several small red and green glyphs spiralled in front of them.* "The wall of power will stop you in your tracks."

Lance: *He looked down towards his feet, raising an eyebrow in confusion.* "But I ain't movin'?"

PKMY: *She slightly smirked.* (Even facing the power of a Hi-Ougi, he still retains this attitude.)

Wendy: *She spiralled her hands, causing the red glyphs to spiral the other way.* (I will make him beg for his life!)

Mindy: *She clapped her hands and held them, causing the green glyphs to glow brighter.* (I will break every bone in his body!)

Lance: "Wat are ya waitin'-?"

*A fluoro blast of red light shot out from one of the glyphs, hitting Lance on the shoulder at blinding speeds.*

Lance: "Kah-" *He bent forward, as he fell backwards in sheer shock, listening to the sound of his bones cracking.* "W-W-?!"

PKMY: (For their strength, the Hi-Ougi is remarkably powerful, but at the cost of being simple in design.)

Wendy and Mindy: "Had enough? Want to beg for your life?"

Lance: (I can't feel my right arm!-) "B-Beg? Yea right!" *He quickly spread his legs and adjusted his stance, standing up straight with a frown.*

Wendy and Mindy: "Take this-" *They pushed forward, causing two glyphs to light up.*

Lance: *He froze on the spot and gasped with widening eyes, watching a fluoro green and red light fire towards him in slow motion.* "TH-THUNDER BOOM"

*A white glyph expanded from Lance's arm, as he bent his legs to brace himself.*

Lance: "Ah!-" *The white glyphic shield shined and shattered, as a hammer and a mallet bounced back.*

PKMY: *She watched the green mallet and red hammer hit the ground, shattering the golden tiles.* "..."

Lance: *He lowered his arm and looked down, taking deep breaths to settle his sudden fatigue.* "Hammers and mallet? Are we gonna hit boxes and fight turtles too?!"

Wendy and Mindy: *They looked at each other and stared into each other's eyes, as if they were connected.* (Even though we shot only two projectiles, he somehow managed to block them-?)

Lance: *He glanced at the mallet and hammer in the corner of his eye, hiding his pain.* (That's what those lights were-)

Wendy and Mindy: "Here it comes." *They yelled in a victorious manner and jumped forward, causing all the glyphs to shoot out red and green lights.*

Lance: "Crap-" *He stepped back, helplessly staring at the glyphs with widening eyes.* "THUNDER BOO-"

*Four red lights hit Lance on the chest, causing him to bend forward in pain.*

PKMY: (Three of his ribs just broke-) *She watched him wheeze for air, as if she didn't care about his condition.* (So, is this his limit?)

Lance: *He coughed up blood, which splattered on the floor.* "I-I.. I hate losin'." *He looked up, noticing the glyphs burst into nothing at the same time.* "Was, th-that, it-?"

Wendy and Mindy: "Don't be ridiculous!"

Lance: *He smirked, showing his blood-covered teeth.* "There's more glyphs, aye!"

Wendy and Mindy: "How unprofessional of us, using this technique against a lowly peasant like you."

Lance: "Totally unprofessional, you non-professional dirty lamps-"

Wendy: *She looked at Mindy with widening eyes.* "Did he?"

Mindy: "You sickening, dirty lamp." *She grunted in anger, causing Lance to smirk.*

Wendy and Mindy: "Time to end this." *They focused all their attention to Lance, clicking their fingers.*

Lance: *He wheezed, focusing his attention on the pain.* (This pain, it feels like my ribs are poking into my lungs-)

PKMY: *She noticed light glow off the floor, causing her to look up intrigued.* "Hmm?"

Lance: *He quickly looked up and noticed the red and green glyphs spiral above him.* "Hyiarh-" *He gargled blood and coughed, completely startled by the glyphs' new location.*

Wendy and Mindy: "Hah harh!" *They raised their arms and dropped then, causing the tips of mallets and hammers to poke out of the glyphs.*

PKMY: (The boy's completely vulnerable...-)

*A swarm of mallets and hammers which looked like flashes of red and green lights, showered on top of Lance.*

Lance: *He covered his head as the ground burst open around him.* (No-..)

*The ground rumbled with every flash of light, causing a dirt cloud to smother the air around Lance.*

Wendy and Mindy: "That is it. Good work, sister." *They faced each other and stepped back, causing the glyphs to fade away.*

Mindy: "Phew." *She took a deep breath, holding her chest in fatigue.*

PKMY: *She quietly stared at the dirt cloud, as silence filled the air.* (Yes, that appears to be it. He did good, we guess we will ask what he wants of us-)

Lance: "It hurts!"

Wendy: (He's still alive?) *She gasped with widening eyes, intensely staring at the dirt cloud.*

Lance: "Burn with fury!" *He shouted with an echoing voice, as red light flickered in the dirt cloud.*

PKMY: (What?!) *She stared at the red light in shock, lowering her arms with interest.*

Lance: *He was blinded by the dirt cloud, staring at his hand which was covered in black tattoo-like lines.* "Untouchable flames-"

Wendy: "What did he say?!" *She noticed the red lights grow in brightness, revealing Lance's silhouette in the dirt cloud.*

Mindy: "I don't know, I thought we had him?"

PKMY: *She lost her composure, stepping back in surprise.* (Grand Remenistal!)

*The room lit up with an intense light that blinded Wendy, Mindy and PKMY.*

Lance: "Haarh!" *He shouted at the top of his lungs, as only the sounds of scorching fire could be heard.*

--

*Wendy and Mindy's charcoaled bodies lay on the floor.*

PKMY: *She lay on the floor motionless, taking a deep breath to recollect her composure.* "We.. How..?"

*PKMY slowly placed her hands on the floor and pushed herself up, watching steam sizzle off the tiles.*

PKMY: "Th-That was not his power.." *She gently touched the side of her face, feeling a graze-like burn mark on her cheek.*

*Lance awkwardly lay on the floor with holes burnt through his clothes which puffed out smoke.*

PKMY: (Nothing can harm us! We adjust our Astragenicons' coating due to knowing the true potential of who calls upon us, that attack obviously exceeded his own-) *She clicked her fingers, which instantly restored her appearance.* (-Which is the sole reason why we were damaged in the process.)

*PKMY scanned across the room and waved her arm, causing the room to appear in its original condition.*

PKMY: *She clicked her fingers, causing Lance to gasp into consciousness.* "So-"

Lance: "Ah, it hurts!" *He whined in pain, struggling to breathe.*

PKMY: "I fully restored you.."

Lance: "... Oh.." *He coughed and stood up, instantly touching his chest.* "My ribs-?" *He felt his clothing which looked new in appearance.*

PKMY: "Fully restored."

Lance: *He had glimpses of red rings made of glyphic platforms, spiralling around his body and arms.* (Wat was that?)

PKMY: *She walked up to Lance and leant to one side, placing a hand on her waist.* "How have you come into possession of such power?"

Lance: *He shrugged his shoulders.* "I dunno." *He looked down, as if he was hiding something from her.*

PKMY: (Little does he know, we have the ability to read memories...) "So, why have you come to see us?"

Lance: ""O-Oh-" *He quickly looked up, staring at PKMY in the face.* "My mother said I have a seal inside of me."

PKMY: "Hmm?"

Lance: "And that it needs to be unlocked by The Voice of On."

PKMY: *She nodded her head.* "Over there." *She waved to the golden wall, causing a silver door to warp and reveal itself.* "Enter, we give you the ability to remove it."

Lance: *He sighed and stared at the door, as if he didn't know what to do.* "What do I need to do?"

PKMY: "Nothing."

Lance: "So, I don't need to swim the ocean or learn somethin' so ridiculous, to help me win?"

PKMY: *She tilted her head in confusion.* "Merely touching the seal shall have the required effects of removing it."

Lance: "Oh-"

PKMY: "You finally have the doorway to what you seek, why do you stand there?"

Lance: *He shook his head and walked towards the door, mumbling in nervousness.* "Yea, you're right."

*Lance stopped and opened the silver door, revealing a dark room similar to a throne room.*

Lance: "It's really dark in there-"

PKMY: "It is dark-" *She suddenly stood behind Lance, causing him to jump in fright.* "Go inside."

Lance: "Yea, wateva-" *He stepped inside, causing blue lightning to light up the room.* "Whoa-"

PKMY: *She followed Lance, staring at the lightning in wonder.* (Intriguing.)

Lance: "This looks like one of them Unknown Territory rooms-"

*A multi-layered, sphere-like glyph responded to Lance's voice, instantly lighting up.*

PKMY: *She looked at the glyphs, watching a fluid-like lightning swirl inside, as if it was trapped.* (Those glyphs? What kind of seal is this?)

Lance: *He stared at the glyphs which contained the fluid-like lightning.* (The lightnin' reacted to me bein' here. It's hard to imagine, but I feel like that's what just happened.)

PKMY: *She kept her thoughts to herself.* "Well?"

Lance: *He looked over his shoulder, glancing at PKMY.* "So, I just gotta touch it?"

PKMY: "Hmm." *She nodded her head, causing Lance to look back to the seal.*

Lance: *He stepped forward and touched the glyph closest to him, causing the sphere-like seal to suddenly shatter like glass.* "Whoa-" *He stepped back and withdrew his hands, as if he did something wrong.*

PKMY: *She examined the lightning more closely, watching it static in one spot.* (This lightning!-)

Lance: "The seal.. It's lightnin'?"

*The lightning suddenly swirled in a fluid-like manner and sparked into Lance, as if he was a conductor.*

PKMY: (If we're right, why would anyone wish to seal such power in the first place? Is it due to trivial traditions making a mixture of the two powers taboo?)

*The lightning completely absorbed into Lance, causing the room to become dark.*

Lance: "Gah..." *He felt his body and faced PKMY, raising an eyebrow in confusion.* "I, don't feel any different?"

PKMY: *She walked up to Lance and closed her eyes.* "As we guessed, we sense the power of an Elementalist in you." *She opened her eyes and clicked her fingers, causing torches to ignite along the walls.*

Lance: "Elementalist? Umm, kool? So...?" *He motioned his head for PKMY to give him more information.*

PKMY: "That is all."

Lance: "I don't feel any different-" *He sounded disappointed, shaking his head in confusion.*

PKMY: "..."

Lance: "So, all that, was a bit pointless?"

PKMY: "We wouldn't say pointless."

Lance: "OK, why shouldn't I say pointless?"

PKMY: "You should have more control over your element, a hybrid of a Remenistal User and an Elementalist is not common."

Lance: (Yay me.) *He selfishly rolled his eyes, as if he was unhappy with the reward.*

PKMY: "Either way, what you have acquired here will be passed on."

Lance: "Passed on?"

PKMY: "Out of your inner-self."

Lance: "Kool.." *He spoke with low morale, keeping his attention on PKMY.*

PKMY: "Also, we feel you may like this, Magnetic Rumble."

Lance: "Magnetic Rumble?" *His arm rose by itself and a white glyphic shield expanded from his arm.*

PKMY: "Now you have your Thunder Boom and Magnetic Shield."

Lance: *His face lit up due to the white glyph, as he admired it with a smile.* "Oh, wicked, thanks-"

PKMY: "We are not sure if we'll see you again, but take care." *She snapped her fingers and the area turned to darkness.*

Lance: *He blinked and noticed his reflection in the pedestal.* "Huh?" *He looked around and noticed the cathedral-like room.*

Locki: "Oh, so you're done?"

Lance: *He shook his head with a mixture of frustration and confusion while facing Locki.* "Y-Yea-"

Locki: *He walked towards Lance, listening to his footsteps echo on the polished floor.* "What happened?"

Lance: *He unintentionally ignored Locki, distracted by thought.* "Do you hear that?" *He tilted his head downwards and looked in the corner of his eye, as he tried to listen to something.*

Locki: "No?"

Lance: "Sword of Memories?"

Locki: "The Sword of Memories? Thy haven't heard of that in a while-" *He looked up, mumbling in recollection.* "Thy am sure that is still in The Ancient Forest."

Lance: "Ancient Forest?" *He uncomfortably covered his ears, as his body started to fade.* "It's really loud."

Locki: (He's waking up-) "Well, thy hope thou got what thou were trying to achieve."

Lance: *He stared at Locki with respect, lowering his arms.* "I did, thank you." *He spoke with an echoing voice, as he disappeared in a swirl of golden light.*

-

Lance: *He looked around, staring at complete darkness.* (It sounds like an argument-)

Ginger: "If this information is correct-"

?????: "No!-" *A man's deep voice shouted.*

Lance: (So loud!)

?????: "You might know what's best, but I'm doing this!"

----------

Lance: *He moaned and rubbed his eyes.* "Huh?" *He leant up and looked at Alicia sleeping beside him, causing him to smile.*

?????: "I'm going, it will help!" *The man's yells came from the other room, catching Lance's attention.*

Lance: (Whoever is yellin', it's pissin' me off.) *He grunted and stood up, walking towards the other room.* (I'll try not to kick the person's arse-)

Ginger: "Ey, Nathan! You can not leave, we are very close to fighting the demon. Please respond."

Nathan: *He stopped and turned around to face Ginger.* "That's exactly why I need to go and get The Sword of Memories, so I can wield the ultimate sword."

Ginger: "Yoh?"

Nathan: "And since when did you care?"

Ginger: *She looked hurt but quickly covered it up with a frown and then an emotionless face.* "If you desire me to join the guild, then should not our objectives line up?"

Nathan: "What?"

Ginger: "Coincide?"

Nathan: "No-, it doesn't matter-" *He turned around and noticed Lance at the door, leaning against it.*

Lance: *He pretended to act cool, while sighing under his breath.* "Ultimate sword? Well, I'm goin' to get this sword, aye."

Ginger: (That foolish dunce.)

Nathan: "You? I think not." *He looked at Lance with a flustered face, causing him to smirk in response.*

Ginger: *She rolled her eyes at Lance, focusing her attention back to Nathan.* "But you do not even know what Unknown Territory it is located in-"

Nathan: "So? I'll just check them all!-"

Arcadia: (Thy have just sent him the locations. Another committable offence in Valhalla's eyes.)

Ginger: *She grunted in frustration, playing with the bandages on her arms in an angry-like manner.* (If Silver Wind Island is truly in trouble-) "And I am telling you, it will take too long-"

Lance: "The Ancient Forest."

Ginger: *She paused and slowly looked at Lance, staring at him in shock.* "Huh?"

Nathan: "Lies. Not even she knew-"

Arcadia: *She stared at Lance with golden eyes.* (His emotions. He is telling the truth? How did he come to find this information-?)

Nathan: *He looked surprised and smirked, slightly turning away.* "Well, I'm off."

Ginger: (The Ancient Forest?) "That is on the other continent! Please respond."

Nathan: "That's fine, I've still got Dawn's stupid Rostical thing." (Thanks again, Rach.)

Lance: "A sword? Well, that means it's mine. I'm coming too, aye."

Nathan: "It's mine." *He competitively smirked at Lance.*

Ginger: *She rolled her eyes, looking at the back of her bandaged-covered hand.* (Boys.. Their attitudes are biologically logical, but to me, its purpose presents the opposite effect on me. How utterly unattractive.)

Lance: *He looked over his shoulder, sighing in a defeated manner.* "Wateva, I guess you can have it-"

Nathan: *He smiled in a triumphant-like manner.* "Realised you'd lose to me?"

Lance: "Nah, I don't want to leave Alicia."

Arcadia: *She glanced at Ginger.* (If he intends to go to an Unknown Territory, thy highly suggest for someone to go with him.)

Ginger: (If Silver Wind Island is in danger, I desire to go there.)

Arcadia: (Ginger..)

Ginger: (I do not care. And I do not desire to go to find a sword that does not benefit me in any manner. Please respond.)

Arcadia: (Alicia Riseley will be in our care. He has nothing to fear.)

Ginger: (Ey, Arcadia. I am starting to grow tired of you.)

Arcadia: (Please. There is so much I can tell thou!)

Ginger: *She paused.* "She will be fine, I am here."

Lance: "Nah-"

Ginger: (Too bad-)

Arcadia: (Try harder.)

Ginger: (Yoh? Do it yourself!-)

Arcadia: (Ginger! Thy can't blatantly tell people what thy see-)

Ginger: "Arcadia, PKMY and Holland are here as well."

Lance: *He paused as if he thought about it.* "No, I don't want to leave her."

Ginger: "Ey." (There is your answer. Perhaps go yourself.)

Arcadia: (Do thou understand everything thy do is for the greater good?)

Lance: "Damn, got excited for nothin'... Next time, aye."

Nathan: "Humph." *He chuckled at Lance, smirking in a taunt-like manner.*

Lance: "Shut up and get rid of that stupid smile."

Nathan: *He observed Lance's posture.* (I don't think he's under Arcadia's influence-) "Hmm, sounds like this sword is mine."

Lance: "..." *He stared at Nathan and frowned in an annoyed manner.*

Nathan: "Only brave people could aim to get the sword, not a coward like yourself."

Ginger: "Ey, Nathan, we found the demon's location-"

Lance: "Aye? A coward?" *He smirked and stepped towards Nathan.* "Like what this lady said-" *He rudely pointed at Ginger.*

Ginger: "Ey, dunce? Do not point that dirty finger in my general direction! Please respond!-"

Lance: "Alicia's fine. So let's go."

Ginger: (He completely ignored me!)

Nathan: *He looked annoyed and interested at the same time.* "Fine-" *He glanced at Ginger with a serious face, catching her attention.*

Ginger: "Ey, Nate.. With this information-"

Nathan: *He continued to stare at Ginger with his serious facial expression, causing her to stop what she was going to say.* "..."

Ginger: "Nathan, Rachael will not be happy-"

Nathan: "As a guild, we're equals."

Ginger: "But-"

Nathan: "If the party comes, tell them I'll be coming back with an ultimate weapon."

Ginger: "Yoh? You addressed the guild as a party?"

Lance: "Not to interrupt your stupid band of heroes you've got goin' on-"

Ginger: "Yoh? I am far from stupid. I possess a high level of intelligence-"
Nathan: "Band of heroes?" *He grunted under his breath with gritted teeth.*

Lance: "But a coward? Ha, I bet you're gonna be the one who'll be the coward." *He cockily smirked, trying to get a reaction out of Nathan.*

Nathan: *He attempted to hide his fists.* (I'm not the same person I once was. I'm not going to fight him because I disagree with what he says.)

Ginger: *She shook her head in a condescending manner.* (That guy brings the worst out of Nathan-)

Nathan: *He firmly gripped around the stone Rachael gave him.* (Activate the stupid Rosterology device-) *He turned around, as a purple glyph drew itself on the floor.*

Arcadia: (Thy'm trying my best to accommodate my friends and keeping in The Wise's order...)

Nathan: "Well, I would like to have someone witness me getting the sword."

Lance: "You made a funny, that's exactly what I was goin' to say." *He walked towards the glyph and stepped on it, picking his nose without care.*

Nathan: "How dare you step on my glyph first! That's such disrespect." *He grunted in frustration, trying to make his childish response sound mature.*

Ginger: "Umm-?"

Nathan: "I'll see you shortly, say hi to Luna for me." *He stepped on the glyph and nudged Lance, sending Ginger off with a smile.*

Ginger: (So arrogant.) *She mumbled and shook her head, watching him disappear with the glyph.*

Arcadia: "Ginger-"

Ginger: "Ey?" *She tilted her head to one side.* "Who is Luna?"

Chapter 7: Alicia's Tale

*Alicia stood with Celest on the edge of a floating island, staring at the clouds below.*

Celest: *She ignored the constant wind which gently swayed her hair to one side.* "Aliciana."

Alicia: "E-Excuse me?" *She looked to her side, causing her hair to flap in her face.*

Celest: "Your name?"

Alicia: "N-No, it's Alicia."

Celest: "Oh, thy beg your pardon."

Alicia: *She gently moved her hair and smiled, biting her bottom lip in a curious manner.* "That's okay."

Celest: "Thou're-" (Thy probably don't need to be so formal-) "You may be wondering the reason why I wanted to see you."

Alicia: *She paused and held her arm in a nervous manner.* "Y-Yep."

Celest: "You've come to the realisation you have Radiatons?"

Alicia: "Yep." *She nodded her head, glancing at her pendant.*

Celest: "People of Valhalla, their powers work differently to others."

Alicia: "You mean how Radiatons work with emotion?"

Celest: "That is true, but no."

Alicia: *She tilted her head with growing curiosity.* "S-Sorry?"

Celest: "We train to develop our powers, while non-divine beings train to receive powers then develop those powers."

Alicia: "I don't understand?"

Celest: "It might be a little different with you."

Alicia: "W-Why?"

Celest: "Because you weren't raised in an area with Radiatons." *She closed her eyes and spread her arms, embracing the wind with a smile.*

Alicia: *She smiled and did the same.* (The smell is beautiful.)

Celest: *She opened her eyes and looked serious, licking her lips in recollection.* "Alicia, you may not remember, but you graced me with your presence once before."

Alicia: *She felt the wind press against her cheeks, nodding her head in agreement.* "Yes, when I was with Millard, Teresa-"

Celest: "No, your Astragon Projection came to Valhalla when you were sealed in the glyph."

Alicia: "When I was in the glyph? What glyph?"

Celest: "The Unknown Territory's glyph."

Alicia: "Oh?" *She sounded surprised, causing her to open her eyes.*

Celest: *She looked down to Alicia's feet, watching the grass sway in the wind.* "I'm glad you're still wearing the garments I gave you."

Alicia: "Huh?" *She quickly looked down at herself, observing her divine-coloured robes.* "You gave me this?"

Celest: "Did you not question the change of garments?"

Alicia: "I-.." *She paused as if she didn't understand the situation.*

Celest: *She closed her eyes, nodding her head in understanding.* "You learnt how to control the flow of Radiatons in your eyes." *She opened her eyes revealing its trademark golden colour.* "Radiatons react to emotion. Excitement is the best emotion to flow."

Alicia: (I'm always excited, even just being here.) *Her brown eyes faded into a beautiful golden colour.*

Celest: *She leant forward and smiled at Alicia's eyes.* "Just like I remember. You must be excited, your eyes are vibrant in colour."

Alicia: (Wow, they're golden like Pepper's?!) *She gasped in thought, causing her to become more excited.*

Celest: "I'd like to show you something rare, only The Wise are allowed to enter-" *She turned away from the ledge and took a slow, deep breath.* "Unless you have permission, of course."

Alicia: "W-Why?"

Celest: "Sorry?" *She looked over her shoulder, staring at Alicia.*

Alicia: "I mean, we shouldn't if we don't have permission."

Celest: *She admired Alicia's kind personality, as she took several steps away.* "They've brought you up well."

Alicia: "H-Huh-?"

Celest: "It's fine."

Alicia: *She watched Celest walk away, cupping her pendant in confusion.* "But-"

Celest: "Hermph." *She clicked her fingers, causing a blinding light to flash in Alicia's face.*

Alicia: "Ah-?!"

Celest: "And here." *Her hair flapped downwards due to a sudden teleportation.*

Alicia: *She blinked several times in disorientation and gently touched her red cheeks caused by the constant wind.* "Where-?" *She looked up and gasped with widening eyes, spinning around in amazement.*

Celest: "This is what we call The Astral Sanctum." *She stepped forward on polished floors, causing her steps to sound like high-heels.*

Alicia: "Wow." *She stared at an enormous slightly dimmed room and noticed glass cabinets containing holy relics, weapons, stones and body parts, which were scattered all the way down the sanctum.*

Celest: *She slightly smirked to herself, giving Alicia time to admire the scenery.* (It is a holy area, bask in its glory.)

Alicia: *She noticed several lights in metallic cylinders shining upwards along the walls, listening to faint, choir-like music which could be heard in the background.* "W-Wow-" *She gasped again, noticing differently-shaped glyphs drawn in detail on the walls.*

Celest: *She coughed, catching Alicia's attention.* "Alicia, have you heard of something called The Swarming Light Flight?"

Alicia: "No?"

Celest: "I would like you to join, it's a game we play."

Alicia: "Oh?"

Celest: "But I will explain that a little later. We are here for something far more important." *She spoke with urgency and started to walk away, causing Alicia to quickly follow.*

Alicia: "What is it you want to show me?" *She listened to the faint music and glanced at each glass cabinet, trying to see what items were inside.*

Celest: "Our most treasured item." *Her high-heel sounding footsteps and proud body posture made her appear very professional.*

Alicia: "Why do you want to show me your most treasured item?"

Celest: "Do people need a reason for everything?" *She continued to walk through the sanctum and towards a wall with three oval glyphs overlapping each other.*

Alicia: "Well-" *She noticed Celest walk straight towards the wall, causing her to stutter in confusion.* "C-Celest, what are you doing? There's a wall-"

Celest: *Her golden eyes shined, causing the wall's glyphs to shine and fade.* "We wouldn't keep our most sacred treasured item so easily accessible."

Alicia: "R-Right.." (I feel a little silly now.)

Celest: "Do not fret, it's similar to Surpreon's doorway-" *She walked through the wall and her footsteps echoed away.* "Follow me, come quick." *Her words echoed from beyond the wall.*

Alicia: *She quickly stepped through the wall, watching the glyphs slowly reappear behind her.* "Celest-?"

*Alicia's face lit up, as balls of warm light floated like fireflies in a circular-shaped sanctum.*

Alicia: *She observed the ancient-like sanctum in amazement, unsure what to say.* "Where, are we?" *She spoke under her breath in wonder, causing Celest to face her.*

Celest: "The room of Radiatons."

Alicia: *She took a deep breath and relaxed, gently rubbing her pendant with one hand.* "This room, such a strange feeling.."

Celest: "Senior members of The Wise believe this is the origins of Radiatons."

Alicia: "The origins of Radiations?" *She stared at the orbs of light in a mesmerised-like manner, before focusing her attention back to Celest.*

Celest: "Yes." *She observed the sanctum with Alicia, pointing to one of the orbs of light.* "Rumours have stated that each one of these orbs is the Radiations of the past Sacred Knights."

Alicia: "They're trapped here?!"

Celest: *She smiled.* "Their Astragons have passed." (It makes me happy how pure her heart is-)

Alicia: "What is this feeling?" *She spoke with a mixture of emotion, noticing the sanctum's warm choice in colours.*

Celest: "It's also been said that, what we're feeling now-" *She touched her chest, causing Alicia to nod her head in response.* "-Is that of true hope, warmth, bonds, and the comfort of peace."

Alicia: "How does that explain this feeling?" *She opened her hand, forming a fist in amazement.*

Celest: "They are the certain mixture of emotions, or the recipe of causing our powers to be at their peak."

Alicia: *She mumbled in acknowledgement, biting her bottom lip in a curious manner.* "Speaking about emotions, you said excitement works best with the golden eyes, what other emotions affect Radiatons?"

Celest: "A valid question, but I will explain later." *She broke eye contact and swayed her arm around the sanctum.* "This room, this room is the keeper to The Philosopher's Heart!"

Alicia: "Whose heart?"

Celest: "An item only the chosen Valkyrie can-"

*The sounds of footsteps echoed towards the room, grabbing Celest and Alicia's attention.*

Celest: *She frowned, quickly standing in a battle-ready pose.* "..."

Locki: *He walked through the wall and instantly noticed Celest and Alicia staring at him.* "Celest?"

Celest: "What are you doing here?" *She unintentionally sounded angry, due to being startled.*

Locki: "The Wise wanted to see if the heart reacted to me, and thy could ask thou the same question?"

Celest: *She exhaled in relief, smiling at Locki.* "The same, but with Alicia."

Locki: "Thy see." *He looked around the room as if it was his first time seeing it.*

Alicia: *She placed her hands on her chest, glancing at Locki.* "Locki, the feeling this room gives me is indescribable."

Locki: *He deeply inhaled and slowly nodded his head in agreement.* "It is such a privilege taking step into this holy sanctum."

Alicia: (This is his first time? Maybe this room is even more special than Celest says.)

Locki: *He watched the orbs of light move about.* (Alicia, this feeling is indeed indescribable.) "What does it look like?" *He spoke softly and excited which was out of his character.*

Alicia: "I-I haven't seen it."

Celest: "Yet."

*The orbs made holy, divine-like sounds as they moved about in the air.*

Alicia: "What-?" *She glanced unexpectedly at the closest orb, intensely staring at it in a wary-like state.*

Locki: "They've suddenly started resonating Radiatons-?"

Celest: "I'm preparing for The Philosopher's Heart."

Locki: *He grunted in realisation, focusing his attention on Celest.* "Please proceed."

Alicia: *She stared at the wall from where Locki came from.* "Anyone could enter in here?"

Celest: "Anyone with Radiatons."

Alicia: "Isn't that a little unsafe?"

Locki: "Radiatons are only acquired to those who are of divine blood."

Celest: "So, no mere mortal could ever access such a sanctum."

Locki: "The same rule applies to The Imperial Glacial Castle."

Alicia: "Imperial-?"

Celest: *She looked at Locki, before slowly focusing her attention to the ceiling.* "I'm going to take her there soon, one at a time would be best?"

Locki: "Of course."

Alicia: (I'm so confused, but, at the same time I'm happy they're doing this for me.)

*A glyph made of golden circles materialised on the ceiling, catching Locki and Alicia's attention.*

Locki: *He stared at the glyph with widening eyes as his armour glistened in its presence.* (Those glyphic formulas? They are similar to a sealing Remenistal, but thy have never seen these before in my life!)

Alicia: *She watched the glyph slowly spiral down to the ground, causing it to shine brighter.* "Wow-"

Celest: *She intensely stared at the glyph, causing her golden eyes to pulsate.* (It takes a lot of Radiatons to access the key.)

*The glyph expanded across the floor, causing the room to light up in a gold treasure-like colour.*

Locki: (Despite reaching top class in The Sacred Knights and even becoming a member of The Wise, to witness such an occurrence-)

*The glyph made the sounds of a door unlocking, cueing it to begin a mechanical-like spiral.*

Alicia: *She stared at the spiralling glyph, causing her to lose balance.* (It looks like the room's spinning.)

Locki: *He spun around, as the orbs of light spiralled in the opposite way to the glyph.* (Impressive, this is just, impressive-)

*Particles of glittering light clustered towards the middle of the glyph.*

Alicia: *She listening to echoing twinkling-like sounds in amazement, as her eyes and pendant sparkled in the lights.* (Are those sounds coming from the light?!)

Locki: (Something is happening in the centre of the sanctum.)

Alicia: "Wow." *She spoke with an echoing voice, causing her to touch her throat in shock.*

Celest: *She watched a golden pedestal rise up from the ground, causing her to smile with a dropping jaw.* (I've witnessed this phenomenon several times, and every single moment, it has left me with my mouth open-)

*The orbs of light suddenly clustered above the pedestal and began forming a circular shape.*

Locki: (The orb, its light is growing in brightness.)

Alicia: *She squinted her eyes, as the ball of light became blinding.* "I-It's really bright-"

Celest: "The Philosopher's Heart."

Locki: "Th-The-, the, the heart?" *He spoke under his breath in disbelief, covering his eyes with one hand.*

*The orb's light faded and revealed a silver orb, which floated above head level.*

Alicia: *She stared at the silver orb, nervously biting her bottom lip.* "I've never seen such a silver that looks like that before."

Celest: "Even now, thy do not know how an item can solidify itself from light alone."

Locki: "..." (Thy am speechless-)

Celest: "Locki-"

Locki: *He coughed and recollected his authority-like posture.* "Thou do not need to tell me."

Alicia: "Tell him what-?"

Celest: "Shh." *She placed a finger over her mouth, staring at the orb with anticipation.*

Locki: *He stepped closer to the orb and reached out, closing his eyes.* (Please choose me.)

Alicia: (What is he going to do?) *She stared at the orb, noticing no reaction to Locki's presence.*

Celest: "My condolences, Locki." *She lowered her head in respect, causing him to open his eyes in disappointment.*

Locki: (Blast the Astragons.) *He formed emotional fists and sighed in release, slowly stepping away in a defeated manner.*

Celest: "Alicia?"

Alicia: "U-Umm." *She nervously stepped towards the orb and closed her eyes.* "What do I do?"

Locki: "Simply talk to it, try and grab a connection."

Celest: "..." *She nodded her head even though Alicia couldn't see her.*

Alicia: (Okay, can you hear me? How are you?)

*Cheers carried by the wind could be heard outside, catching Locki's attention.*

Celest: (Tssk, oh well.) "No response either."

Alicia: *She opened her eyes and leant back with failure.* "I-I'm so sorry."

Locki: "Well, thy must attend the stadium with The Wise." *He glanced at Alicia and looked back to Celest, pointing behind him.* "Do what thou have to do, thy will meet thou there."

Celest: "Thou will."

Locki: "It was good seeing thou again, Alicia." *He turned around and started to walk away, stepping through the wall.*

*The glyph and pedestal faded, causing its gold, treasure-like lighting to fade away.*

Celest: *She watched the silver orb disintegrate into a wave of glittering light, noticing the sanctum revert back to its original condition.* "It was a blessing to be in The Philosopher's Heart's presence."

Alicia: *She looked down, tightly holding onto her pendant with both hands.* "I-I failed you-"

Celest: "You don't need to be sorry, my dear. You are not at fault." *She walked up to Alicia and gently placed a hand on her back, before slowly walking towards the wall.*

Alicia: *She shuffled her feet and looked to her side, staring at Celest in a guilty manner.* "I-It wasn't my fault?"

Celest: "Moving on. About this game, I mentioned to you previously."

Alicia: "The Swarming Light Flight?"

Celest: "Yes. One of the main incentives why I want you to do this-" *She walked through the wall, listening to the change of their footsteps.*

Alicia: "W-Why?" *She walked slightly faster, causing Celest to lower her arm.*

Celest: "Because the winner gets to view the origin of Radiatons."

Alicia: *She quickly glanced at a glass cabinet which contained a ruby-like crown.* "Origin of Radiatons? Didn't you say it was the room we were just in?"

Celest: "Hmm, then think of it as the purest of Radiatons."

Alicia: "O-Okay. What does it do?"

Celest: "It instantly unlocks your full potential."

Alicia: (Fullest potential?!)

Celest: "People who have been chosen for special events are selected to view this."

Alicia: "What kind of special events?"

Celest: "Knighthood into The Sacred Knights, dark affinity users, S-classed missions-" *She paused, shaking her head.* "It's not important."

Alicia: "If it unlocks your potential, why don't you do it to everyone?"

Celest: "The reason why we don't do it often, is because people who are weak at heart, have a high chance of dying."

Alicia: "R-Really-?"

Celest: "Don't stress, though, you'll need to focus all your attention on the game."

Alicia: "But.. A high chance of dying?" *She whispered to herself, awkwardly listening to their footsteps.*

Celest: "Alicia.."

Alicia: "Okay." *She nodded her head as she tried to keep up with the conversation.*

Celest: (I understand this is a lot to take in, please bear with me, Aliciana.)

Alicia: "With the game, what is it?"

Celest: "Swarming Light Flight, it's similar to playing tag but-" *She stopped and faced Alicia, elegantly leaning against a glass cabinet.*

Alicia: *She stopped and looked at Celest, noticing her serious face.* "T-Tag?"

Celest: "Love, the Radiant wings are lit by love, have it be family, friends, morals, items or partners, focus the love and image two sets of wing-like glyphs from a bird's eye view."

Alicia: "Love.." *She half closed her eyes and thought to herself.*

Celest: "Close your eyes and-"

Alicia: *Wings of radiant light suddenly exploded on each side of her back.* "Y-Gerh-" *She bent forward with a loss of breath, exhaling with a dropping jaw.*

Celest: "Don't push yourself-"

Alicia: "I d-didn't need to imagine anything..." *She spoke in confusion, noticing the floor slightly shine from the light of her wings.*

Celest: *The glass around her shined white.* (Those are the largest Radiaton-based wings thy've ever seen!)

Alicia: *She looked to each side in the corner of her eye, glancing at the radiant wings.* (Wow! I can feel my wings! They're like another set of arms.. If that makes sense..)

Celest: *She stared at the wings in a proud manner.* "To release your wings, just simply expel the Radiatons."

Alicia: "H-How do I do that?"

Celest: "In a similar manner to your Healing Rings or other Radiaton-based Remenistal."

Alicia: "I-I'll try-" *She slowly exhaled and stood up straight, causing the wings to disintegrate into tiny white orbs.*

Celest: "Good work."

Alicia: "Umm, did I do it right? Or would you like me to do it the proper way?"

Celest: *She retained her professional posture.* "Proper?"

Alicia: "Imagining the two glyphs? I didn't imagine anything-"

Celest: "Let's go."

Alicia: "Go?" *She looked startled, staring at Celest in confusion.* "Go where?"

Celest: *She paused and stared into the glass cabinet, staring at a pair of bronze gauntlets.* "It's a little nasty of me."

Alicia: "Sorry?"

Celest: "Pushing you into the game without having much training." *She leant off the cabinet and started to silently walk away.*

Alicia: "..." *She followed Celest, staring at her back in a curious, lost-like manner.*

Celest: "Well, no training."

Alicia: (So, I'm going to be participating in this game..?)

Celest: *She stopped and looked up to the ceiling, staring at enormous detailed glyphs.* "But, I believe in you."

Alicia: *She stopped behind Celest and smiled.* (I don't know what's expected of me.)

Celest: "And here is the game." *She clicked her fingers and a flash of white light, teleported them out of the area.*

-

Alicia: *She squinted her eyes and suddenly felt a nice, warm breeze blowing against her face.* "Outside-?"

*Alicia whispered to herself and noticed an enormous floating mountain in the fading light.*

Alicia: *She stood on a small floating island, awing at the mountain.* "Was that always there?"

Celest: "Yes, but you can only see it if you know of its presence."

Alicia: *She noticed several people fly through the air around the mountain.* "Are the games held on the mountain?"

Celest: "No." *She pointed up towards hundreds of people flying across the sky.*

Alicia: *She looked up and gasped to herself, unintentionally smiling in excitement.* "B-But, I've never flown through the sky before."

Celest: "You'll be fine, I just want you to have fun, it's only a game."

Alicia: "But, what about the incentive-?"

Celest: "Stop with the buts, have fun." *She reached behind her back and pulled out a pair of golden goggles smothered in a swirl of sparks.*

Alicia: "What are they for? They look similar to what Pepper wears around her neck."

Celest: "You wear them, so the wind doesn't hurt your eyes."

Alicia: *She nodded her head in confusion.* (How would the wind hurt?)

Locki: "All candidates, start your warm-ups, the game will begin shortly." *His voice echoed through the wind clearly.*

Alicia: *She looked around for Locki's voice, nervously shivering in excitement.* "Umm-"

Celest: "What's wrong? Are you cold?"

Alicia: "N-No, I don't often feel the cold. I'm just a little nervous and I have butterflies in my stomach, it almost feels like it's Battling Oxident."

Celest: *She smiled and drifted her attention to the sky.* "Put your goggles on and meet up with me." *Radiant wings exploded from her back, causing her to slowly drift up.*

Alicia: *She stepped forward in panic and tapped her back as if she forgot how to access her wings.* "H-How-?"

Celest: *She looked down and watched Alicia panic with a smile.* "Love!"

Alicia: "T-Tssk." *She grunted in a rushed manner as two massive wings exploded from her back.*

Celest: (Aliciana-) *She nodded her head and looked up, blasting high into the sky.*

Alicia: "I-I-" *She awkwardly squirmed, trying to put the goggles over her head.* "C-Can't-"

*Alicia finally placed the goggles on her face and adjusted them until she was comfortable.*

Alicia: *She sighed in relief and lowered her arms, noticing her wings bend in a fluid manner with the wind.* (I need to take PKMY's advice and relax..)

*Several men with feathered wings flew around Celest, as they warmed up for the games.*

Man: "Hey, Celest!"

Celest: "Why hello, good luck this game."

Man: "Yeah, I've been strengthening my wings!" *He smiled at Celest and flapped his wings, causing a powerful gust of wind to blow past her.*

Celest: *She hovered in mid-air, smiling back at the man.* "Very good!"

Man: "Aura-based wings are better for manoeuvrability, and physical wings are better for speed."

Celest: "So, practising on your strengths?"

Man: "That's exactly what thy have been doing!" *He smirked in confidence, pointing behind at his wings with his thumb.*

Celest: "Smart, hope that works out for thou."

Man: "Thank you, for your blessings." *He smiled and flew away with his quiet party members.*

Celest: (Thy always enjoy the fun atmosphere during these games, it is one of the few times even The Wise sit back and relax-)

Alicia: *She awkwardly floated up and nudged her head on Celest's breast.* "O-O-Oh dear, e-e-excuse me." *She nudged herself away and drifted several feet back, avoiding eye contact.*

Celest: "Don't be sorry, it was an accident." *She smiled and floated towards Alicia with her legs swaying behind her.*

Alicia: "Well, I finally got them on." *She pointed at the goggles in a victorious manner.*

Celest: "Mission completed?" *She slowly inhaled, enjoying the soft warm breeze.*

Alicia: *She smiled with blushing cheeks as her hair gently swayed to one side.* "Y-Yep!"

Celest: *She watched Alicia's pendant dangle in the air, due to floating at an angle.* "Any questions so far?"

Alicia: *She tried to position herself upright, focusing her attention on Celest.* "So, it's like tag?"

Celest: "Yes. Two blue ribbons will materialise on your sides-"

Alicia: "Really? When? What?" *She looked at her sides, filled with excitement.*

Celest: *She hid her smirk, ensuring to keep her professional-like composure.* "The aim is to rip them off the other players."

Alicia: *She focused on her breathing and slowly exhaled, trying to relax.* "You said the winner-"

Celest: "As thy said before, don't worry about that."

*Party-sized groups of women and men flew together in clusters, cheering their excitement towards the other players.*

Alicia: "If it's just a game, why are the winnings so-"

Celest: "When thou win, thou'll understand."

Alicia: "When?"

Celest: "Yes, when."

Alicia: "I c-can't-"

Celest: "Don't ever say thou can't. It's as simple as that."

Alicia: ".. Okay..."

Celest: *She noticed Locki flying towards a peculiar position in the air.* "It's about to start-" *She flew forward and hugged Alicia.* "Thou'll be fine."

Alicia: "Celest-?"

Celest: *She flew back and suddenly blasted through the air towards Locki.* (Thy've always preferred to be a supportive type, rather than being a frontline offensive type.)

*A party of four women with radiant wings flew past Celest, giggling in excitement.*

Celest: *She smiled at the women without losing speed or direction.* (But, when watching the games, thy always want to participate.. Thy'm sure it won't be a problem if thy request to partake in the next game.)

Alicia: "It's about to start?" *She looked confused, as a blue ribbon materialised on each side of her waist.*

Locki: *He held a handful of blue ribbons, raising them above his head.* "Due to noticing several young adults with newly acquired wings, be feathered or radiant-"

*Locki's voice loudly echoed across the sky, catching all the contestants' attention.*

Locki: "-I'll briefly explain the rules." *He purposely positioned himself in the air in a particular way, giving the illusion he stood on the air.*

Alicia: (Rules-) *She glanced at Locki and tried to stop drifting in the wind, kicking her legs in a swimming-like manner.*

Locki: "Merely go up to your opponent and pull on the ribbons-" *He placed the ribbons on his waist and ripped them off as a demonstration.* "The ribbons will fall off and eventually disintegrate into Radiatons. There is no need to keep the ribbons."

*Locki paused and listened to the sounds of the wind blowing, as all chatter came to a halt.*

Locki: "The last two finalists, or the last two to have kept one or two ribbons, will test their might through the eye of a tornado!"

Celest: *She watched the more mature-looking people chatter amongst themselves.* (They've competed in these games for some time.. They only seem to get excited near the end-)

Locki: "Begin!" *His words suddenly caused groups of people to instantly separate, cueing cheers of enthusiasm and excitement to fill the air.*

Celest: *She hovered next to Locki, smiling at the competitiveness of the swarming people.* (What a sight..)

Alicia: "B-Begin?" *She whispered to herself, as her hair gently flapped to one side.*

Child: "Tee heee, gee bee!" *A small child with abnormally large feathered wings glided past Alicia, ripping one of her ribbons off.*

Alicia: *She spun around and watched the ribbon float down towards the clouds.* "No-" *She flew backwards accidentally knocking into a woman who flew at high speeds.*

Woman: "Argh-" *She spiralled out of control, as she kept her speed and momentum.* "No!-" *She hit another four members, as they violently collided into each other.*

Alicia: *She covered her mouth in a guilty manner, watching eight ribbons float downwards, before disintegrating into nothing.* "S-Sor-"

Man: *He dived directly towards Alicia, flapping his feathered wings in determination.* "Harh-" *He flew into striking distance and punched her in the chest, causing her to deeply cough.*

Alicia: "Ah!- Ouch!" *She coughed again, holding her chest in shock.*

Girl: *She floated on small weak radiant wings, pointing at the man.* "That's cheating!"

Man: *He looked up to Locki, Celest and members of The Wise, ensuring they weren't looking.* "Hah-" *He flew to the side and spun around, kicking the girl downwards.*

Girl: "Eek-" *Her two ribbons floated above her, as she dived towards the clouds.*

Alicia: *She gasped, watching the girl fall through the clouds.* "That's horrible!"

Man: *He looked over his shoulder and stared at Alicia, smirking with a mean expression on his face.* "Thy want to learn how to use Holy Lance."

Alicia: *She tightened her hand and scrunched the robes around her chest, nervously frowning at the man.* "..." *She leant to one side, blowing at an angle with the wind.*

Man: "Thy desire that Remenistal, so thy gotta win!" *He stuck out his tongue and faced the mountain, preparing to fly towards it.*

Alicia: "I-I-..."

Man: *He sighed and looked at Alicia, noticing her fluid-like wings.* "Thou don't even have your second release, don't bother me." *He flapped his wings and flew towards the mountain.*

Alicia: "N-No, that's... Unacceptable." *Her wings burst and moved like razor blades.* "That is selfish, mean, horrible, and, and, just mean."

Man: "Have a cry, I'll get your ribbon shortly!" *He shouted, as the wind carried his voice.*

Alicia: "Humph!" *She tilted forward and blasted towards the man, causing her hair and pendant to rapidly flap behind her.*

Man: *He looked behind him and was surprised by Alicia's offensive nature.* "Well, a chaser? Thy've been in these games long enough to know how to handle people like thou!"

Alicia: "People like me?"

Man: "Yeah, losers!" *He tilted his head down and blasted towards the clouds, causing a trial of glittering-like residue to spray from his wings.*

Alicia: "Hermmff." *She wheezed and tilted angle, slowly gaining more speed than the man.*

Man: (She's able to keep up, even at this speed?) *His feathers quickly and individually flapped on his wings.*

Alicia: *She watched the man skim the top of the clouds, causing their puffy-like appearance to distort.* (I, can get him.) *She had flashbacks of Lance, PKMY and Celest's supportive faces.* (I will do it for them!)

*Alicia braced herself and frowned, suddenly diving into the clouds.*

Man: *He looked behind him and noticed a splash-like appearance in the clouds.* (Maybe thy gave her too much credit, she couldn't control the momentum of her speed?)

*The man flapped his wings and kept his speed, looking down at his shadow on the clouds.*

Man: (Even if she could keep her speed under control, she wouldn't be able to deal with the pockets of wind holes around here.) *He smirked and looked up, staring at several people with feathered wings.* (Who's next-?)

*A rush of wind caused the man to tilt to his side, causing him to spread his arms with widening eyes.*

Man: "Thy know the wind currents from the back of my hand, there isn't an air rip around here-" *He stopped in mid-sentence, as he watched one of his ribbons spiral past his face.*

Alicia: "W-Who's slow now?!"

Man: "Above!?" *He looked up and was blinded by the sun's light.*

Alicia: *She dived down at incredible speeds, snatching the man's other ribbon.* (Tee hee.) *She smiled and flew into the clouds out of sight.*

Man: *He froze with surprise, staring at the hole Alicia left in the clouds with a dropping jaw.* "I.... Can't believe this." *He sighed with frustration and paused, slowly drifting towards the mountain in a defeated manner.*

Locki: "All players who have lost their ribbons, fly on to the mountain and cheer on your allies, friends or family!"

Alicia: *Her hair, pendant and robes flapped upwards, as she continued to dive through the clouds.* (The clouds actually feel puffy.) *She felt her cheeks and closed her eyes, causing her to giggle.* (I feel like Lance is watching me.)

*Sunlight shined on Alicia, causing her to open her eyes.*

Alicia: *She burst out of the clouds and stopped in mid-air, causing a trail of cotton-like streaks to puff away from her.* (I'm under the clouds? But sunlight is still shining-?)

*Several yells and laughter could be heard above the clouds, filling Alicia with excitement.*

Alicia: (I wonder if anyone down below can see me right now?) *She looked down and watched waves in the ocean crash along a golden shore.* (I want to play this now.)

*Alicia giggled and bent her knees, blasting up through the clouds.*

Alicia: (This feeling is amazing!) *She smirked in confidence, watching the clouds brush past her.*

*A man chased a woman whose radiant wings sparkled behind her.*

Man: *The sparkles blew in his face, which disorientated him.* "Thy'm quicker than thou!"

Woman: *She stared ahead with all her concentration.* (He's close!-)

Alicia: "Tee hee." *She flew up in between the man and the woman at incredible speeds.* (How come I can fly faster than them?) *She looked down and noticed a ribbon in each hand as she continued to fly upwards.*

Man: "What?!" *He grunted, staring at his waist in shock.*
Woman: "Huh?! My ribbon!"

Locki: *He scanned across the sky, noticing Alicia fly into sight.* "Wow, the size of her wings."

Celest: *She smiled, nodding her head in agreement.* "Just like her father's, don't thou think?"

Locki: "Hmm." *He grunted in agreement, watching Alicia fly in circles around multiple players.* "He was a good man, who died protecting Valhalla."

Celest: *She looked down with sadness.* "Yes..."

Locki: *He coughed and faced Celest.* "How long have thou been training her for?"

Celest: "Thy haven't, why do thou ask?"

Locki: "Thou haven't? She's flying in circles around the other players-"

*Five players dived down in front of Locki, causing blasts of wind to rapidly blow his robes to each side.*

Locki: *His hair flapped over his face, as he watched the five players chase after each other.* "That looks fun."

Celest: *She watched three ribbons swirl away from the five players, causing her to smile in thought.* (Thy'll never forget the excitement when a Sacred Knight is chosen due to their acrobatic performance displayed in these games.. Thy think that could also be a variable why people take The Swarming Light Flight seriously.)

Alicia: *She held four ribbons in one hand as they rapidly flapped around her wrist.* "You're fast." *She spoke to a woman with radiant wings who flew slightly in front beside her.*

Woman: "You're? Where are your manners?!" *She reached down and placed her hand over the ribbon, ensuring it was still there.*

Alicia: *She bit her bottom lip with a growing smirk.* "I-I'm sorry, I'm just complimenting you."

Woman: ".. Thou're fast too." *She flew at high speeds, causing her body to slightly rock to each side.* "Thy'm good at the risk flight."

Alicia: "Risk flight?"

Woman: "Watch, if thou want to get my ribbon." *She smirked and flew towards the mountain, cueing her wings to move like razor blades.*

Alicia: *She swirled her body and followed the woman's flight pattern with ease.* (Risk? It's a little troubling that I have to keep asking questions.) *Cold winds blew against her face.* (That slightly burns my cheeks-)

*Alicia paused and stared at the woman in realisation, becoming aware of the goggles.*

Alicia: (Thank you Celest for the goggles..)

Woman: *Her long ponytail flapped to all sides, as she flew several feet away from the mountain.* (Risk flight, flying or gliding incredibly fast, near obstacles.)

Alicia: *She noticed the woman fly dangerously close to the mountain.* (What is she doing?!)

Woman: *She quickly flew at an angle barely avoiding chunks of rock, which poked out of the mountain.* "Hehe, let's see if she can keep up now?" *She reached her arm out and touched the mountain, causing a wave of dirt to swirl in strings behind her.*

Alicia: *She flew behind the woman and lifted her legs, avoiding several roots which dangled from the mountain.* (This, is, close-)

*Alicia looked up to the woman and flew through the dirt, causing her to cough as she breathed through her mouth.*

Alicia: *She shook her head and squinted her eyes, focusing her attention back on the woman.* (She's-She's going to hit the mountain!)

Woman: *She elevated and brushed her fingers along long strands of grass.* "Do thou want the ribbon, or not?" *She smirked and flew into shade, due to the mountain blocking the sunlight.*

Alicia: *She avoided several shards of rock and flew into the shade, causing her to shiver.* (The wind is much colder here-)

Celest: *She looked down and noticed Alicia, chasing after the woman extremely close to the mountain.* (Aliciana, please don't be reckless!) *She looked slightly worried, ignoring the sounds of cheerful squeals from above.*

Woman: (Once she gets close enough-) *She paused, skilfully avoiding the uneven pillars of rock and vines from the mountain.* (-That's if she doesn't slam into the mountain first-)

Alicia: *She spiralled in the air and avoided the rocks, suddenly gasping as a vine cut her on the arm.* (This must be the risk part? I think I understand now.)

Woman: *She held her shoulder in pain, triggering images of her violently hitting the mountain from a previous game.* (That scar was tough for my mother to heal-)

Alicia: (I need to focus! What is she planning?) *Her hair flapped behind her.*

Woman: (At the right moment, thy'll flip above her and dive down, taking the ribbon before she even realises what happened!) *She smiled at her plan, glancing behind her at Alicia.*

Alicia: (What is she smiling about?)

Woman: *She focused her attention back in front, slowly gaining more speed.* (With my technique of the risk flight, thy was able to reach the semi-finals once.)

Alicia: (Maybe she wants to out-speed me? Or, make me use all my energy just following her-?) *Her foot clipped on a shard of rock, which pointed out at an awkward angle.* "Ouch!"

*Alicia squealed and violently spiralled around, as pieces of rock shattered around her.*

Woman: *She smirked and flew on a side, quickly looking behind her.* "Was that her hitting the mount-?" *She grunted in confusion and paused, slowly focusing her attention back in front.* (She's gone?)

Celest: *She looked back down and noticed falling pieces of rock.* (Aliciana!-)

Locki: "Don't do anything irrational."

Celest: "Th-Thy know."

Woman: "Well, she wasn't that bad thy guess. She kept up with me for a long time-" *She flew at an even faster speed, causing her to squint her eyes.* (The last game when thy focused on the small fry, the top tier players went for each other nearly placing me as a finalist.)

Alicia: *She flew directly towards the woman like a torpedo.* (My wings are starting to feel even lighter-)

Woman: *She stared at Alicia flying directly at her with an emotionless face.* "I-Is that-? That girl?! A head-on collision?!"

Alicia: *She kicked her foot on the mountain, causing her to spiral at an angle.* "Got it!" *She grabbed the ribbon, as she flew downwards away from the woman.*

Woman: *She slowed down oblivious to what just happened.* "How, did, thou, do, that?"

Alicia: *She let go of the ribbon and spiralled back up to the woman.* "Did you say something? The wind was blowing in my ears."

Woman: *She came to a halt and stared at Alicia with shock.* "How did thou get in front of me?"

Alicia: "W-Well, PKMY would've been annoyed with me-" *She spoke with awkward pauses, as she took quick, short breaths in exhaustion.* "-She would've yelled at me for following you that long."

Woman: "Pee-kay-me? Why?"

Alicia: "Because you mastered the risk flight. So I decided to fly around the mountain and hopefully confront you, and it worked."

Woman: "Thou went around the mountain." *She motioned her hand in a circle, causing Alicia to nod her head.* "But the mountain is huge."

Alicia: "I know-" *A cheerful scream caught her attention on the other side of the mountain.*

Woman: "..."

Alicia: "I better go, tee hee." *She spun away and blasted up into the sunlight.*

Woman: *She looked up in shock, causing her to smirk in respect.* (Thy haven't seen her face before, but, she is someone thy don't mind losing against.)

Locki: *He slowly scanned the sky, silently counting the people with his lips.* (There's only five-) *Alicia flew above the mountain, catching his attention.* (Six remaining.)

Celest: (Aliciana!) *She gasped in thought, hiding her smile.*

*Massive yells and whistles echoed from the mountain, as crowds of Valhalla citizens cheered the remaining players.*

Locki: *He watched three men with radiant wings stare at each other in a triangular-like pattern.* (What are they going to do?)

*The three men bent forward, causing their wings to move like razor blades.*

Celest: "Hmm?" *She watched the men charge towards each other, causing the crowd to cheer.*

Alicia: *She noticed the commotion in the corner of her eye, causing her to gasp.* (No, they're going to hit!-)

*The crowd moaned in pain, as the three men slowly fell towards the clouds.*

Locki: (What a waste of three people.) *He tried to contain his excitement, watching five ribbons drift in the air.*

Celest: (They lost all their ribbons with that brutal collision-) *She rolled her eyes in disappointment and scanned the sky.* (We're nearly down to the two finalists.) *She showed more interest in the game, as she also tried to contain her excitement.*

Alicia: *She drifted with the wind and thought to herself.* (So, there's a large man with bright aura wings, and a small woman with feathered wings, and-) *She quickly spun around and gasped to herself.* (Huh? Then there's only three of us left?!)

Man: *He glanced over to Alicia who floated in the distance and faced the woman.* "Let's get rid of the small fry and compete in the finals?"

Woman: *She smirked in a competitive manner and kicked her leg, causing her to face Alicia.* "Sure."

Man: *His aura wings moved like razor blades and he suddenly blasted towards Alicia.* (Thy want the finalist to be strong, an honest challenge!-)

Woman: *She flapped her wings and flew at amazing speeds towards Alicia.* (Thy was so close to winning before, thy've trained many months for this!-)

Alicia: *She gasped, staring at the man and woman intimidated.* (Oh no-) *She quickly turned around and blasted down towards the clouds.*

Locki: *He looked shocked, watching the man and woman quickly catch up to Alicia.* (She exceeded my expectations.) *He thought to himself as if Alicia already lost.*

Celest: (Those two topple her with experience-) *She watched them fly into striking distance.* (They already caught up to her!-) *She leant forward in suspense, as the three players flew into the clouds.*

Locki: *He sighed in disappointment, staring at three splash-like holes in the clouds.* "Thy wanted to see what happened."

Alicia: (They are the fastest I've ever encountered-) *The woman flew next to her and reached for the ribbon.* "N-No." *She flew slightly faster and out of the woman's reach.*

Woman: *She watched the ribbon flap around her fingertips before Alicia dived out of range.* "Missed-" *She straightened her body and reached out, trying to grab onto Alicia's foot.*

Man: "Let me get her instead!" *He flew past the woman, causing her to tumble forward.*

Woman: *She spread and flapped her wings, causing her to stop in mid-air.* "No thou don't-" *She blasted through the clouds and looked around slightly lost.*

Alicia: *She spiralled in the air, purposely keeping a fixated stare in front.* (Why did they team up against me?!)

Woman: (Thy can't see through the clouds, but, thy'll follow the lights of their radiant wings-) *She flew forward, staring at four moving lights in the clouds.*

Man: "Give it up, new girl, thy'm too experienced for thou!"

Alicia: *She remained quiet as she bit her bottom lip.* "I think, it's here-" *She quickly paused and shot directly upwards, causing the surrounding clouds to pulse like a wave.*

Man: "Amateur flight moves-" *He blasted directly up but at a faster speed.*

Woman: *She noticed the light from their wings fly upwards, causing her to tilt angle.* (Since thy lagged behind, thy'll be able to pick up speed by using this angle and catch up easily.)

*The clouds around the woman started to move past her at an increasing speed.*

Alicia: *She shot out of the clouds and was instantly blinded by sunlight.* (The sunlight-?!) *She closed her eyes and suddenly stopped in mid-air, causing her hair to violently whip upwards.* (The sunlight, my plan.. I think I missed it-)

*The man and woman shot up from the clouds at unbelievable speeds and was instantly blinded by the sunlight.*

Man: "No!-"
Woman: "Can't!-"

*Suddenly two rock-shattering sounds echoed through the air, instantly catching Locki's attention.*

Locki: *He kicked his leg and spun around, noticing large rocks fall down.* "What was that?"

Celest: *She twirled around in confusion, watching the rocks fall into the clouds.* "Alicia?"

Alicia: *She tilted her body and looked up in shock.* "I-It, worked." *She spoke under her breath and smiled, watching the man and woman drift away from the mountain.*

Man: "My nose!" *He held his nose with both hands in pain, ignoring the dripping blood which ran down his wrists.*

Woman: "My forehead!" *She rubbed pieces of rock off her forehead, noticing blood on her fingertips.*

Alicia: (I can't believe one of my plans worked.) *She giggled, which caught their attention.*

Man: "Why you laughing?! The game still isn't over!-"

Alicia: "Tee hee, I win, yay." *She victoriously felt her red, cold cheeks.*

Woman: "Thy don't believe it." *She looked down, watching four blue ribbons float away in the breeze.*

Man: *He noticed the ribbons disintegrate into the air.* "Thy-Thy... Lost."

Locki: "Wow, thy wasn't expecting this to happen."

Celest: *She coughed in disbelief, glancing at Locki.* "Fantastic! Locki?"

Locki: *He shook his head in realisation and faced the crowd on the mountain.* "There will not be a finalist, as there is only one person remaining-"

*Locki's words caused cheers and boos to echo from the mountain.*

Locki: "That concludes The Swarming Light Flight." *He shouted in a concluding-like manner, watching several people fly off the mountain.*

Celest: *She hovered over to several members of The Wise.* "Excuse me." *She straightened her legs as if she stood on the air and bowed to one knee in respect.*

The Wise: "Yes?" *His old frail voice spoke with a sense of authority, as he faced Celest hidden behind the robes.*

Celest: "Do thou mind if thy take the winner to her winnings?"

The Wise: "Thou wish to take the winner to The Imperial Glacial Castle?"

Celest: "Th-That won't be a problem?"

The Wise: "That is fine, thy'm sure the other members would enjoy the sun's light once in a while." *He sounded as if he was smiling.*

Celest: "Thy thank thou, for your generous respect."

The Wise: "That is all." *He turned around and floated towards another member of The Wise without evidence of wings.*

Celest: *She stood up and smiled.* (Excellent-) *She faced Alicia who floated in the distance.* "Thy feel, very happy-" *She spoke to herself and stepped forward, disappearing in a flash of white light.*

Man: "HEALING RINGS"
Woman: "INVOKING LIGHT"

Alicia: *She watched differently-toned light swirl around the woman and man.* (Wow-)

Celest: *She suddenly appeared in front of Alicia, waving light out of her face.* "Thy am proud."

Alicia: "C-Celest." *She looked startled as if she did something wrong.*

Celest: "What are thou doing?"

Alicia: "Them-" *She watched the man and woman heal each other's wounds, causing her to smile.*

Celest: (The two who crashed into the mountain-) "They're healing each other?" *She spoke in confusion, as if it was nothing important.*

Alicia: "It's just nice seeing something like that."

Celest: "Oh-" *She discreetly smiled to herself, admiring Alicia's appreciation.*

Alicia: "Why did Locki say the games were over? Something was next?"

Celest: "What do you mean next?"

Alicia: "He said after the tag, there's something involving a tornado?"

Celest: "You won. It has only happened twice in history when there was only one finalist."

Alicia: *She pulled the goggles down, letting them dangle around her neck.* "I w-won?" *She spoke under her breath, covering her mouth in disbelief.*

Celest: "Yes." *She smiled, spreading her arms apart.*

Alicia: "Tee hee, hehe." *She flew forward and hugged Celest.*

Celest: *She kissed the top of Alicia's head, slightly rocking to each side in happiness.* "I knew you could do it."

Alicia: "If I won, we should go and get my reward?" *She spoke with awkward confidence.*

Celest: "A reward you deserve." *She clicked her fingers and they disappeared in a flash of white light.*

-

*Celest glided out of white light, causing surrounding glass-like ice to shimmer in response.*

Celest: *Her wings burst into white orbs, causing her to land on the glass-like floor.* (Thy am proud she won, even without any training, and it being her first game.) *She spun around, watching Alicia float out of the fading light.*

Alicia: *Her wings disintegrated, causing her to awkwardly land on the floor.* "W-Where are we?" *She looked down and stared at her clear reflection in the ice.*

Celest: "This-" *She spoke with an echoing voice, spreading her arms far apart.* "Is The Imperial Glacial Castle."

*Enchanted music could be heard throughout the gigantic castle. Light moved along the ice, as if the ice or light tilted angles. Slight sounds of moving ice could be heard outside.*

Alicia: *She tapped her feet and listened to it echo.* "Everything is made of glass, the walls, floors-" *She looked up, staring at her upside down reflection.* "The roof, everything." *Her jaw dropped in amazement, as mist blew out of her mouth.*

Celest: "It's not glass, it's ice."

Alicia: "H-Huh? Doesn't it melt?"

Celest: *She let out a chuckle, causing her to cover her mouth.* "Excuse me."

Alicia: "What's so funny?"

Celest: "You remind me of the first time I was allowed in here." *She looked up, watching raindrop-like ice shards glitter near the ceiling.*

Alicia: "What is that music?" *She continued to look around, trying to pinpoint the sound.*

Celest: "Do you like it?" *She started to walk backwards and looked at Alicia, waiting for her response.*

Alicia: "Y-Yep."

Celest: "The instrument The Wise implemented here, is something called an ocarina."

Alicia: "I like it." *She subconsciously followed Celest, listening to the sound with a smile.*

Celest: "You know the ancient deity I showed you?"

Alicia: "The floating orb?" *She walked by Celest's side down a hall-like room, triggering images of the silver orb and golden room.*

Celest: "We say that the item is located in here for added protection, it was my idea." *She smiled.*

Alicia: "Wow, you're smart too."

Celest: "Don't flatter me, it'll get you anything you want."

Alicia: "Tee hee-" *Celest's reflection on the floor caught her attention.* "If it's ice, how come you're not slipping?"

Celest: "I'll have you answer that question first."

Alicia: "Ice is my element, I don't slip on ice." *She spoke in an innocent manner.*

Celest: "If someone even with an ice affinity slipped, then we could've hidden The Philosopher's Heart here after all."

Alicia: "Tee hee, and you?"

Celest: "It's all Radiations." *She spoke with a smile and turned around, walking forward.*

Alicia: *She looked past Celest's back and noticed a door frame which blended in with the atmosphere.* "I almost didn't notice the doorway."

Celest: "Because everything is made of ice?"

Alicia: *She nodded her head.* "Yep."

Celest: *She walked through the doorway and made her way towards a set of ice stairs, which spiralled up.* "I know every room to this castle, so we'll get to the destination very quickly."

Alicia: "Th-That's good."

Celest: "Hmm." *She grunted in agreement, elegantly walking up the ice stairs.*

Alicia: "I-If you don't mind me asking, what is the reward?"

Celest: "I do not mind you asking, please don't feel nervous."

Alicia: "I-I'm not."

Celest: "Your nervous-like stutter is a clear indication you are, and your reward is having The On Resonance."

Alicia: *She took a deep breath and bit her bottom lip, closely following Celest up the stairs.* "Okay."

Celest: "You said you wanted to know what other kind of emotions work with our Radiatons?"

Alicia: *She instantly looked interested, eagerly nodding her head.* "Yes."

Celest: "Sadness causes our Radiatons to lose power, but it causes a Rasticsplash to occur with every attack."

Alicia: "Wow." *She whispered to herself, waiting for Celest to continue.*

Celest: "Desperation, anger, rage, are the emotions which amplify our power in strength. Whilst, loneliness and jealousy, are the only two emotions that negatively lowers all of our power's attributes."

Alicia: "Loneliness and jealousy, got it."

Celest: "Love, is obviously the strongest emotion, therefore, the biggest factor of our power."

Alicia: "Yep." *She enthusiastically nodded her head in agreement.*

Celest: "Friendship boosts our healing power."

Alicia: *She looked down, watching her step in recollection.* (When I think about it, I only just realised, healing my friends seem to work easier for me, rather on someone I don't know-)

Celest: "And lastly, the drive to protect, that boosts the radiant or feathered wings."

Alicia: (Drive to protect?)

Celest: ".. I've been meaning to ask." *She quietly walked up the stairs, pausing in thought.* "How was your life?"

Alicia: "I'm sorry?"

Celest: "How was it? Living with your parents." *Her tone was low and serious.*

Alicia: "It was ordinary." *She looked slightly puzzled, due to Celest's odd question.*

Celest: "..."

Alicia: "Although I had an incident with a Scoldrant when I was young, it was near a lake-"

Celest: "I mean, how did it feel?" (Thy watched thou grow up by using The Divine Pedestal.) *She had images of observing the land below through the water-filled pedestal.*

Alicia: "I, don't know how to answer that."

Celest: *She shook her head in dismissal.* "Excuse the strange questions, we're here." *She stepped on the last step and admired a small throne-like room.*

Alicia: "That's okay." *She stepped by Celest's side, looking across the room in disorientation.* (Everything looks the same to me.)

Celest: "And, here is your reward for completing the game." *She gently placed her hand on Alicia's back and stepped forward.*

Alicia: *She stopped and paused, looking at Celest in realisation.* "But-"

Celest: "What is it?"

Alicia: "You said earlier, I could d-die?"

Celest: *She looked at Alicia, noticing her pendant sparkle in the ice's presence.* "One is needed to have both the divine eyes and wings."

Alicia: (I have them both!)

Celest: "And a great way to know if you're strong enough to withstand it, is by using the games as a pre-trial."

Alicia: "..."

Celest: "Alicia?"

Alicia: "Okay, that sounds understandable." *She whispered to herself, as if she had another question.* "Then what about the feathered wings?"

Celest: "They grow with the body, but like radiant wings, Radiatons need to fill the wings in order to take flight."

Alicia: "Oh, so they can't fly without having the Radiatons in them?"

Celest: "Well, yes. One of the advantages of feathered wings is the ability to glide once you're able to walk."

Alicia: *She unintentionally smiled, noticing several reflections of Celest's image in the ice.* "That's amazing."

Celest: "Let's continue, unless you don't want your reward?" *She smiled at Alicia and walked forward.*

Alicia: "..." *She quickly followed Celest and stopped in the middle of the room.* (There's nothing? Just ice...)

Celest: *She looked to her side, noticing Alicia's confused face.* "Don't be fooled by the room's appearance."

Alicia: "Why?"

Celest: "The Voice of On is highly potent here." *She took several steps back and walked out of the room.*

Alicia: *She looked over her shoulder at Celest.* "W-Why are you leaving?"

Celest: "Long ago, I had already received the power of The On Resonance." *She stepped on the stairs, glancing at Alicia.* "I don't need it again."

Alicia: "Umm, okay.." *She looked lonely and confused, nervously glancing around the room.*

Celest: "I'll be just outside, if anything happens, I'll be here for you."

Alicia: "You'll be just outside-?" *Her voice became mute, causing her to touch her throat in shock.*

*The ocarina and the constant sounds of moving ice suddenly stopped.*

Alicia: (Everything is quiet.)

*Alicia noticed white sparkling powder blow off the ground, walls and surrounding ice, watching it swirl around the room.*

Alicia: *She looked back to Celest for assistance, noticing the ice covered the exit.* (No! I'm trapped!)

Celest: (Good luck, Aliciana.) *She looked at her hand, unaware of the ice which covered the doorway.*

Alicia: *She silently yelled out Celest's name.* "..."

*The powder wafted near Alicia, causing her to hold her head in pain.*

Alicia: (My head, it feels like it's going to explode.) *She stuttered in thought and dropped to her knees, covering her eyes in pain.*

-

Alicia: *She heard sounds of howling wind, causing her to become alert of her surroundings.* "Where am I?" *She noticed she could talk, causing her to lower her arms.*

PKMY: "Another visitor?" *She stood in a secluded field, watching knee-high white flowers sway in the wind.* "Outside? That's refreshing."

Alicia: *She looked around ignoring several flowers, which brushed against her arm.* "PKMY, where are we? I was in a room made of ice-"

PKMY: "We are not PKMY."

Alicia: *She observed PKMY with a serious face and her eyes shined gold.* "A being not of this land?"

PKMY: *She smiled in shock.* "Correct."

Alicia: "The white powder from The Unknown Territory, I remember that. But this didn't happen before."

PKMY: "Your powers weren't fully awakened."

Alicia: "Oh." *She stepped back and tensed up, preparing to fight.*

PKMY: "You don't need to prove yourself by fighting."

Alicia: *She discreetly sighed in relief, cupping her pendant.* "G-Good?"

PKMY: "But how do you feel, knowing that you've killed people?"

Alicia: *She gasped and stepped back startled, causing her to crush a flower behind her.* "I-I had to."

PKMY: "Striking Mindy, we believe her name was."

Alicia: "M-Mindy-?"

PKMY: "She wasn't even watching."

Alicia: "W-What do you mean?"

PKMY: "You struck her from behind." *She took a step forward and leant to one side.* "She was merely following the instructions of her superiors, and you murdered her for that."

Alicia: *She stepped forward, enthusiastically shaking her head.* "No, it was in self-defence."

PKMY: "What about Lucky?"

Alicia: "It was Ridley who-"

PKMY: "By your own memories, your attack killed the Guardian which in turn, killed Lucky."

Alicia: "That was an accident."

PKMY: "You're classing the death as an accident? Was it accidental you used your Remenistal on the Guardian?"

Alicia: "No-"

PKMY: "You're a healer, a divine being said to protect life. You've saddened us by your murderous intent!"

Alicia: *Her eyes watered.* "But-"

PKMY: "You're pathetic, not worthy of Radiatons."

Alicia: "I-I'm not pathetic."

PKMY: "You are, so easily broken by words."

Alicia: "I'm not a murderer, I'm not a killer, I'm not pathetic, I'm Alicia Riseley! I don't even want to fight!"

PKMY: "Then why do you fight?"

Alicia: "B-Because I have to."

PKMY: "You think proud or inspiring words will bring back the life you've taken?"

Alicia: *A cold gust of wind blew around her, causing a few strands of hair to flap over her shoulder.* "My friends have told me, not to let anyone talk or walk over me."

PKMY: "We are just not anyone!"

*Alicia looked down, tightening her grip around the pendant for comfort.*

Alicia: "I-I know the actions I've done, I know they're inexcusable, but the decisions I chose to do, were in the best interest-"

PKMY: "Are your words true to their meaning?"

Alicia: "Y-Yes!"

PKMY: "Then-" *She smirked with respect and her image disappeared.*

Alicia: "Where.." *She whispered under her breath, watching the flowers sway in the vacant field with blurred vision.*

PKMY: *She reappeared behind Alicia, staring at her back.* "You're worthy of your reward."

Alicia: *She looked slightly startled and silently wiped her tears in confusion, slowly turning around.* "Huh-?"

PKMY: "Do you know what you are?"

Alicia: *She intensely stared at PKMY, pretending to be fine.* "Alicia-"

PKMY: "I said what?" *She reached down and brushed her fingers along a swaying flower in front of her.*

Alicia: "Someone with Radiatons?"

PKMY: "No, what do you hope to achieve?"

Alicia: "Now?"

PKMY: "On your quest with your friends? You stick out like a sore thumb."

Alicia: *Her eyelashes were wet, due to the tears.* "My appearance?" *She spoke softly, glancing down with low morale.*

PKMY: "You have no reason to be with them. You have no personal drive."

Alicia: "I want to be by their side! And heal the wounded!"

PKMY: *She paused and walked closer to her.* "That's what we wanted to hear from the start. Your power, we can give you the strength of the title you've already been chosen for."

Alicia: "W-What does that mean? I've been chosen for what?"

PKMY: "You get to heal more people, you get to protect those who matter to you."

Alicia: "Yes." *She sniffed and looked up, awkwardly smiling with hope.*

PKMY: "Then by your permission, we welcome you as a Sacred Knight."

Alicia: *She silently opened her mouth in shock.* "..."

PKMY: *She stood face to face with Alicia and raised her arm.* "For someone who hasn't been in contact with Radiatons for very long, your efforts have been recognised." *She touched Alicia's forehead, causing her to squeak in pain.*

Alicia: *She stepped back and unintentionally frowned with pain.* "S-Sacred Knight.." *She squinted her eyes, rubbing her forehead and around her eyebrows.*

PKMY: "But, there is one cost to pay for such power."

Alicia: "Cost." *She sounded disappointed at the offer, as if she knew she wouldn't like it.*

PKMY: "An offer of good gesture, we'll allow you to finish off your current quest."

Alicia: *She stopped rubbing her forehead and lowered her hand, revealing an 'S'-shaped tattoo on her forehead.* "Is that it?"

PKMY: *She stepped back and concentrated, spreading her arms.* "Just a moment-" *Golden streams of sand poured up from the ground and swirled around Alicia's robes.*

Alicia: "What's happening?"

PKMY: "Your new title, the garments will be indestructible like your healing Remenistal."

Alicia: (I'll be able to heal people without worrying about fainting, not that it has happened recently-) *She watched the area blur and swirl around her, causing her to lose train of thought.*

PKMY: "As a Sacred Knight, you are no longer restricted to the formula of Astragons and Neurons, meaning, all your Remenistal will have a boosted Radiaton effect."

Alicia: *She listened to PKMY's voice echo, as her garments changed colour and texture.*

PKMY: "All your base attributes such as stamina, Remenistal resistances, offences and affinity are almost doubled in power."

Alicia: *She watched the air stop swirling, noticing PKMY staring at her.* "What happened-?"

PKMY: *She looked at Alicia, noticing white tight robes with golden lining, which covered her from top to bottom.* "Now you look like a Sacred Knight."

Alicia: "Wow."

PKMY: "Now, about the price you have-"

Alicia: *She giggled, looking straight down at herself.* "My robes, they're beautiful-"

PKMY: "Excuse us? It's disrespectful to do that."

Alicia: "O-Oh-" (I just interrupted her-) "I'm sorry." *She stopped admiring her clothing and stared at PKMY with all her focus.*

PKMY: "The price you have to pay, is to leave all your emotional attachments of the land below." *She waited for Alicia's reaction, knowing there would be a problem.*

Alicia: "Okay."

PKMY: *She looked surprised, as if she wasn't expecting that response.* "Really?" (Hmm, maybe we underestimated this girl's drive-)

Alicia: "Yep." *She nodded her head in confusion and looked down at the swaying flowers.*

PKMY: "We weren't expecting you to agree. Leaving behind emotional attachments are a hard thing to do."

Alicia: *She paused and stared at PKMY, nervously holding onto her arm.* "Sorry, I don't really understand what you mean."

PKMY: "Whatever attaches you to the land below, you must ignore them, and focus on the duties as a Sacred Knight."

Alicia: "You mean things that make me angry, upset, happy-?"

PKMY: "Yes."

Alicia: (Leaving everything behind?) *Her eyes widened in deep thought.*

PKMY: "Now realising what is expected of you, what is your decision?"

Alicia: *She bit her bottom lip and looked uncomfortable, avoiding eye contact.* "Even.. Love?" *She spoke softly as if she was afraid to hear PKMY's answer.*

PKMY: *She stared at Alicia in confusion.* "Did we previously make it unclear? Yes, all emotional attach-"

Alicia: "No!" *A cold gust of wind violently blew around her, causing all the flowers to turn red.*

PKMY: *She noticed the flower's change in colour.* (Such emotional power! This woman has incredible latent potential!-)

Alicia: "M-My mind is made up!"

PKMY: "Are you sure-?"

Alicia: "I'm positive!"

PKMY: "It's necessary in order to be a Sacred Knight-"

Alicia: "Then take the power!-" *She spread her arms, symbolising she no longer wanted her powers.* "I'm not losing Lance."

PKMY: "You don't get a choice in the matter, a Sacred Knight is far too important than a selfish emotion you hold with another."

Alicia: "I've always cared about what other people think, but this time, let me be selfish. My love for him is-"

PKMY: "Merely an attachment, an obstacle, blocking you the power of a Sacred Knight!"

Alicia: "I do get a choice-" *She yelled at PKMY with emotional enthusiasm.* "I'm the happiest I've ever been-"

PKMY: "..."

Alicia: "I won't ever sacrifice love for anything." *Radiant wings burst out of her back, as she proudly confronted PKMY.*

PKMY: "Think about the decision you're making. What about all the people you're going to let die by not accepting the power to heal them."

Alicia: "I'd rather be dead than to not experience love for myself!" *She shouted with watering eyes, as the flowers slightly bent back due to the force of her radiant wings.*

PKMY: "Don't you want to heal, save lives? When we lay eyes on you-" *She paused and held the side of her head in disappointment.* "You're more pathetic than we first anticipated."

Alicia: "N-No, I want to heal, save lives-"

PKMY: "Then we don't see what the problem is-"

Alicia: "But I want to do it, by Lance's side. Why can't I have both?"

PKMY: "Rules are the rules. You won't be able to heal effectively without the power boost worthy of a Sacred Knight."

Alicia: "I'm already an efficient healer-"

PKMY: "You haven't tasted the power you currently wield.. Release yourself from the bond with the boy and join Valhalla, that way you'll get to keep those powers-"

Alicia: "No-" *Tears ran down her face and her wings moved like razor blades, causing the flowers to violently sway around her.* "No, I can't do it."

PKMY: *She paused and folded her arms.* "Then, give yourself time to think about it."

Alicia: "Why? My mind is already made up."

PKMY: "All Sacred Knights faced this same situation, and all of them made the right choice! You aren't the only person to react in this manner."

Alicia: "I-.." *She scrunched her eyes shut and shook her hands with emotion.* "I won't-" *Her voice loudly echoed, causing her to open her eyes in confusion.*

*The sparkling white powder swirled around Alicia and pulsed into a large sphere away from her, twinkling into nothing.*

PKMY: "Come to us in your physical form, when your answer is to accept the responsibilities of a Sacred Knight." *Her voice echoed in Alicia's ear.*

Alicia: *She noticed her reflection in the ice and sniffed, taking deep, emotional breaths.* (I'm back?)

Celest: "Alicia-?" *She quickly stepped into the room, alerted by Alicia's loud yells.* "Alicia, is everything fine?!"

Alicia: *She faced Celest and slowly nodded her head.* "I-I'm fine." *She sniffed again, quickly wiping the tears away.* "Sorry."

Celest: "Hey, sshh." *She slowly walked up to Alicia and hugged her in a motherly manner.* "Everything will be fine."

Alicia: "I-I was faced with a hard ultimatum." *Her words muffled, as Celest continued to comfort her.*

Celest: "Thy know, thy went through the same thing."

Alicia: *She slightly leant back, looking up to Celest with a saddened face.* "And what was your answer?"

Celest: *She looked away slightly frustrated.* "I can't help you."

Alicia: *She nodded her head in understanding, slightly buckling at the knees.* "I'm starting to feel weak."

Celest: "You might be awakening."

Alicia: *She looked away and back to Celest.* "Could I please ask you a question?"

Celest: "Sure." *She let go of Alicia and smiled in concern, brushing her hair out of her face.*

Alicia: "Why have you been so nice to me?"

Celest: *She quickly turned around and started to walk away.* "I like your new garments."

Alicia: "Oh, th-thank you." *She looked down and sniffed.*

Celest: "Now don't strain yourself, I'll see you soon."

Alicia: *She covered her ears in disorientation, listening to loud echoing sounds.* "Do you hear that?"

Celest: "No."

Alicia: "W-Wait, you didn't answer."

Celest: *She stopped, discreetly looking at Alicia's reflection in the ice.* "..."

Alicia: "Why are you so nice to me?"

Celest: *She smiled and faced her.* "The answer will cause you stress-"

Alicia: "..." *She lowered her arms and a golden swirl caused her to fade away.* "T-Tell me-"

Celest: *She took a nervous breath and twiddled her fingers.* "Because I am your mother."

----------

Alicia: *She gasped and woke up in the bed.* "W-What?" *She whispered, looking around disorientated.*

PKMY: *She walked into the room and coughed, catching Alicia's attention.* "I thought you might be awake-"

Alicia: "I told you already!" *She leant up, shouting with a frown.*

PKMY: *She looked slightly startled.* "Wat?"

Alicia: "I told you, my mind is already made up!-"

PKMY: "Shut it, princess." *She grunted and rolled her eyes.*

Alicia: *She looked startled.* "PKMY."

PKMY: "Yea, talk to me like that again and I'll hit you in the face like I do with Lance." *She grunted, purposely forming a fist.*

Alicia: *She awkwardly looked away.* "Y-Yes."

PKMY: *She sighed as if she was discreetly happy to see Alicia.* "So, you're finally up."

Alicia: "Yep-" *She paused and stared at PKMY.* "How did you know I was awake? Was I making noises?"

PKMY: "I could sense it."

Alicia: "Sense? How-?"

PKMY: *She closed and opened her eyes.* "You're feeling surprised and a little vulnerable, I can sense your feelings."

Alicia: *She looked to her side and stared at the vacant bed next to her, noticing wrinkles in the silk-like sheets.* "Where is Lance?"

PKMY: (I revealed I could sense emotion, but she's too busy worrying about Lance-) *She sighed and leant to one side, folding her arms.* "He's off to get some sword, it's more relaxing now that he isn't here." *She smirked.*

Alicia: *She looked down and ran her fingers down across the bed.* "H-He left, just like that?"

PKMY: *She sighed and rolled her eyes.* "He didn't want to leave, but knowing me and Holly are here put him at ease."

Alicia: "Oh, okay-"

PKMY: "Anything else, your majesty?" *She grunted and slightly frowned.*

Alicia: "N-No, sorry."

PKMY: *She grunted with a smirk.* "So, did you go to Valhalla?"

Alicia: *She gently rocked back and forth, looking slightly ill.* "Umm.."

PKMY: "Herm?" (She doesn't look so-)

Alicia: "..." *She closed her eyes and a small wave-like pulse moved along the blankets, catching PKMY's attention.*

PKMY: (What was that feeling?) *She closed her eyes with interest.*

Alicia: (I feel something drawing my being-) *She suddenly felt the rainbow-coloured aura which ignited deep in Concern's Gate.* (The aura! It calls for me.)

PKMY: *She opened her eyes at the same time as Alicia.* (She's grown stronger, much, much stronger.) *She hid her findings as she lowered her arms.*

Alicia: *She shook her head and looked around, as if she just woke up.* "Has anything happened?"

PKMY: "I've completed my training, I'm waiting for Arcadia's permission to leave."

Alicia: "Waiting for permission? You?"

PKMY: *She walked up to Alicia and punched her on the shoulder, causing Alicia to whimper.* "She tutored me, I have to show her respect."

Alicia: *She awkwardly giggled and looked up to PKMY.* "She tutored you?"

PKMY: "Why sound so surprised?"

Alicia: "Well, I had the feeling you knew everything." *She spoke with a sense of respect.*

PKMY: *She smiled and reached down, helping Alicia onto her feet.* "I'm hungry too, let's grab something to eat, eh?"

Alicia: *She looked surprised and held her stomach, smiling in agreement.* "Yes, I'd like that."

PKMY: *She started to walk with Alicia, stepping into the next room.* "Eh? What's wrong?" *She looked at Alicia in confusion, walking towards the green door with red flames on it.*

Alicia: *She looked at PKMY startled.* "I didn't say anything."

PKMY: *She raised an eyebrow in a curious manner, placing her hand on her chest.* "You have a weird lost feeling."

Alicia: (Wow, that's how I feel right now, PKMY's amazing.) "Umm. I don't like how we're all scattered."

PKMY: "Heh." *She smirked as she made her way to the front door.*

Alicia: "What's so funny?"

PKMY: "I was actually feeling the same thing."

Alicia: "Really?"

PKMY: "Yea, even Holly said the same thing-" *She watched the door burst into flames and noticed Holland step through the dying fire, filling the room with light.*

Holland: *He noticed PKMY and Alicia, causing him to put on a fake, sleazy-like smile.* "Why hello there, lovely ladies."

PKMY: "Spoke too soon." *She smiled due to Holland's presence.*

Alicia: *She smiled and looked surprised.* "Holland-"

PKMY: *She playfully frowned at Holland, unintentionally interrupting Alicia.* "Hello yourself, you feral ogre."

Holland: "Dang, that hurt, Docta Jingles!" *He held his chest, pretending to be hurt.* "Kiss me better?"

Alicia: *She watched PKMY storm towards Holland.* "Kiss? Holland, that's a little inappropriate-"

PKMY: *She kissed Holland on the lips and walked outside, waiting on the veranda.* "Let's go, Holly, we're getting something to eat."

Holland: "Food? I'll happily invite myself." *He spoke in a deep voice and smiled, quickly waving Alicia out of the house.*

Alicia: *She rudely and unintentionally pointed at Holland, staring at him with a dropping jaw in shock.* "W-What're you-?"

Holland: "I was just checking up on you and saw PKMY already doing her thing."

Alicia: "N-No, I mean-"

Holland: "You coming? You must be hungry." *He spoke with a smile and stepped outside, waiting next to PKMY.*

Alicia: *She stepped onto the veranda and continued to point at Holland.* "Are you two-?"

PKMY: "Don't get sidetracked by little things." *She grunted at Alicia.*

Alicia: "R-Right." *She lowered her arm.*

PKMY: *She started to walk away, leading the party off the veranda.* "Don't keep me waiting again."

Holland: *He smiled and walked with Alicia along a beautiful vibrant garden, closely following PKMY.* "Did you know PKMY can read emotions now?"

PKMY: "She sure does." *She grunted in an arrogant manner, triggering flashbacks of Alicia being more concerned over Lance.*

Alicia: "Y-Yep." *She nodded her head, admiring the cherry blossom trees in the village.*

Holland: "Well, Alicia. Get me in the loop, what's the conversation been about?" *He looked down to Alicia, placing his hands on his head.*

Alicia: "I just wanted to know how everyone is going."

PKMY: "Since we haven't been a party for a while."

Holland: "Yeah, I know what you mean-" *He mumbled and looked up.* "I kinda miss Lance's jokes, Tyler's strict get-go attitude, and-"

PKMY: "We get it."

Holland: "Okay, okay-"

PKMY: "Good." *She smirked in a victorious manner.*

Alicia: "I wonder where Teresa and Season are? I hope they're okay."

PKMY: "They're strong, you don't need to worry about them." *She smiled and continued to lead Holland and Alicia through the village.* "Tyler, he's probably at Surpreon."

Holland: "Doing his paperwork?"

Alicia: *She shook her head.* "He was with us last."

PKMY: "Who was with you?"

Alicia: "Lance, Tyler and Chrisma." *She stepped on neatly trimmed grass, ensuring she didn't step on anything breakable.*

Holland: "You guys left Tyler and Chrisma alone?"

Alicia: "Oops, umm, Madora was there too." *She mumbled the last part as she awed at falling sakura leaves, which blew past her on to the ground.*

PKMY: "I have a feeling we'll all meet up soon."

Alicia: "Y-Yes."

Holland: *He scratched under his chin.* "Definitely, we have to, we can't let the Consultant get away with what he's done."

Alicia: *She noticed burn marks on Holland's hand, causing her to stop walking.* "Here-"

Holland: *He stopped and faced her.* "Huh? My burns? Don't worry, it's nothing. I've already tried to get them healed-"

Alicia: (I know some wounds leave a scar when healed, but something feels different-) *She closed her eyes and white rings spiralled around Holland, instantly healing the scars and his non-visible wounds.*

PKMY: *She looked over her shoulder and smiled.* (The power of light.)

Holland: "Wow, thanks!" *He rubbed his hands and then his stomach.* "That slight background aching pain, it's finally gone."

Alicia: *She smiled with blushing cheeks in a modest manner.* "You're welcome."

PKMY: "Now you can stop whining."

Holland: *He looked at his hands in amazement and formed a fist with a confident smirk.* "I actually forgot you could heal."

Alicia: *She stared at Holland's perfectly healed skin in confusion.* "How could you forget that?"

Holland: "Ah?"

PKMY: "You forgot because you see Alicia as a friend, not a tool to heal."

Holland: "Yeah, I already knew that-" *He looked down to Alicia and smiled in appreciation.* "What would we do without you?"

PKMY: "I surprisingly agree with him-"

Holland: "Hey, play nice." *He smirked at PKMY, who smiled back at him.*

PKMY: "Being a healer, you've helped the party numerous times. We really do appreciate you."

Holland: "If my Astragons were ever reborn, I'd want to come back as someone with Radiatons."

PKMY: "Eh? Wat if you came back as a woman?"

Holland: "I'd have big bouncy boobs, of course."

PKMY: "Heh." *She rolled her eyes and her stomach growled, causing her to frown.* "Blah, why build a dry mess on the other side of the village?!"

Alicia: *She remained quiet, looking at her hands in thought.* (Healing...-)

Holland: "Thank you again-" *He mumbled and walked past Alicia, taking a deep breath.*

PKMY: "I'm starving!" *She grunted, slightly increasing her walking speed.*

Holland: "Well, I'm hungry, too-" *He yelled at PKMY, purposely trying to get a reaction.*

Alicia: *She ignored PKMY and Holland's conversation, as she slowly lost track of thought.* (To heal others, maybe I should really think about it... Going to Valhalla, giving up my attachments to heal..?)

Chapter 8: Alchemy Confusion

*A cold strong sea-breeze blew Tyler, Chrisma and Madora's hair to one side, as they stared at Silver Wind Island.*

Chrisma: "Oh, get in! You made it, Madora."

Madora: *She leant forward in a weary manner.* "I was going to send you two here by yourselves." *She exhaled slowly and stood straight, deeply inhaling through her nose.*

Chrisma: "Huh?"

Madora: "After dropping you two off, I was going to proceed to see what the results on The Rubistral Moon were."

Tyler: "In Surpreon?"

Madora: "Yes."

Chrisma: "But, you're here? This isn't Surpreon." *She groaned in an oblivious manner.*

Tyler: (Really?)

Madora: *She relaxed, looking down to the waves.* "I decided to take refuge in this city before doing so."

Tyler: (That's a smart move, she looks really drained-)

Chrisma: "What are we actually doing here?"

Tyler: "We said this before, I'm going to use their resources to get back to Surpreon."

Chrisma: "Oh bless."

Madora: *Her long black hair blew in the wind.* "Once I have rested, I will start reuniting the party and see what actions follow."

Tyler: "That sounds like a great idea, Madora."

Madora: "Thank you, deary."

Chrisma: "So, let's enter Silver Wind Island? Whoup whoup." *She jumped into the air and stepped near the cliff, facing the island.*

Madora: *She pointed at the island with a silver pearl which materialised in her palm.* "The key."

Chrisma: *She stared at the pearl and looked over to the island, groaning with excitement.* "..."

Tyler: *He heard the groans, causing him to slowly look at Chrisma.* "..."

Chrisma: "Now, transform!" *She raised her arms into the air, noticing the island react to the pearl's presence.*

Madora: "Please, I need concentration-"

Chrisma: "Whoup whoup!" *She groaned under her breath and watched the island warp, as a swarm of Silver Triplets swirled around it like a tornado.*

Madora: "We have time to chatter later."

Tyler: "I agree."

Chrisma: *She lowered her arms, nodding her head in acknowledgement.* "S-Sure." (I can see why Joy respects this lady.)

Tyler: *He looked down to his RPG bag, brushing dirt off it.* (I didn't pay much attention to their research areas-)

*Tyler looked up and noticed Madora walking across the aura-like path, causing him to hesitantly follow.*

Tyler: (I wanted to check their facilities, but I was too busy talking to Grey. I wonder what advancements they have over Surpreon?)

----------

Lance: *He walked with Nathan across a grassy field, noticing slight patches of sand.* "Gah-"

Nathan: (He's such a complainer... Reminds me of the first time I got to know Luna-)

Lance: *He looked over his shoulder, noticing the air warp due to the heat.* "The desert sucks."

Nathan: "Maserio, I love warm weather."

Lance: "Good for you."

Nathan: "I thought bringing you along would motivate me into getting the sword faster, but you're just annoying me."

Lance: "Well, you are motivatin' me."

Nathan: "Explain?"

Lance: "I picture holding the sword and rubbin' in it your face." *He smirked, causing Nathan to frown.*

Nathan: "Have fun rubbing the sword, I'll be using it to slash your face."

Lance: "Ooo, Natalie came up with a comeback!"

Nathan: (Natalie?) *He attempted to not react to the name.* (He even calls me what Luna does-) *He walked up a slight hill, noticing trees in the distance.*

Lance: "Nothin' to say?"

Nathan: *He ignored Lance, noticing the vegetation.* "There it is, The Ancient Forest, East off Maserio."

Lance: "The forest? In front-?" *He squinted his eyes and stared at orange and red trees in the distance, causing him to stop.* "That ain't the forest."

Nathan: *He stopped and faced Lance in frustration.* "No, this is The Ancient Forest."

Lance: "I was there before, and it was green."

Nathan: *He rolled his eyes.* "Fine, go to your version of The Ancient Forest."

Lance: *He folded his arms like a child and watched Nathan walk off.* "..."

Nathan: (I'm really grateful for my bloodline abilities regarding the landscape. Should be a change of season since he was there last.)

Lance: "Tssk, wait." *He grunted and flailed his arms, following Nathan in a defeated manner.*

Nathan: *He walked into the forest, looking up to the large trees filled with bright orange and red leaves.* "I can't wait to get The Sword of Memories."

Lance: "Nah don't be, 'cause it's mine!-" *He jogged up to Nathan, glaring at him in a competitive manner.*

----------

*Madora, Tyler and Chrisma stood in front of the massive castle, listening to the busy-like chatter in the background.*

Chrisma: "The great castle of Silver Wind Island-" *She looked behind her, noticing hundreds of people walking about.* "It sure is busy today."

Madora: "Tyler, the castle-" *She grabbed Tyler's attention and walked towards the door, staring at the flapping flags.* "-There are five levels-"

Tyler: "Or six including the roof, I've already been here before."

Madora: "Oh?" *She sounded surprised and stopped in front of the door.* "Okay then." *She smiled at Tyler and stepped into the castle, causing the door to ripple around her.*

Chrisma: "Didn't we need a key to enter? Joy always uses a key." *She groaned in confusion, stepping through the door.*

Madora: "I only need a key to enter the city, nothing more."

Tyler: (Wow, that's Madora for you.)

Chrisma: "Of course." *She mumbled in respect towards Madora.*

Tyler: *He stepped on the long thin red carpet, glancing at Madora.* "I think you can rest on the third floor?"

Madora: "No, the second floor. The third floor is their research area, the fourth floor is the weaponry and fifth floor is the royal floor."

Chrisma: (I've seen Grey, he's really nice to Joy, but very mean to Lupton and myself.)

Madora: "Please, don't make a fuss in these halls." *She stopped at the stairs and started to walk up, holding onto the white rail for support.*

Chrisma: "Right, not in the halls, whoup whoup."

Tyler: *He observed the pale walls, climbing up the stairs.* "So, Chrisma, what will you be doing?"

Chrisma: "I need a bit of rest myself." *She cued a yawn, waving her hand in front of her mouth.* "So, I'll rest with Madora."

Tyler: "Oh, sound reasonable." *He reached the second floor and faced Madora and Chrisma, as if he was ready to part ways.*

Madora: "If you haven't left for Surpreon before I wake up, I'll come and see you."

Tyler: "Sure, that would be great. You two get some rest."

Chrisma: *She stood next to Madora and faced Tyler.* "Will you be fine walking the castle without permission?"

Tyler: "I've been here before, so they know my face. I'm sure if I said I was friends with Season and Madora they would understand."

Madora: *She smirked as she turned around.* (He's smart.) "See you, for now, Tyler." *She walked down the corridor and turned left into a room.*

Tyler: *He watched Chrisma walk down the corridor.* "You too, Madora."

Chrisma: "Good luck with your research, Tyler." *She smiled at him, tugging on her robes.*

Madora: *She inspected the room, smiling in relief.* (A bed, perfect.) *She hobbled over to the bed, causing items in the room to move on their own accord for her convenience.*

Chrisma: "Oh, bless you both." *She groaned to herself and walked into the opposite room to Madora, plummeting herself on the bed.*

Tyler: *He rubbed his eyes and moved his shoulders, facing the stairs.* (I know I'm tired, but I won't be able to get any sleep.) *He grunted and moved the RPG, walking up the stairs.* (Season said several times that Silver Wind Island's research facilities are the same as Surpreon.)

*Crowds of laughter could be heard outside, giving the castle a serious-like atmosphere inside.*

Tyler: "There's something I want to do." *He reached the third floor, which had a wider and longer hallway than the other two.*

*Tyler paused to himself and listened to echoing chatter down the corridor, taking a deep breath.*

Tyler: *He nervously kept to himself as he walked down the corridor.* (It's weird, I can't really work with noise, but when it's typing or researcher-like mumbles, I'm fine.)

*Tyler reached the end of the corridor and turned left, awkwardly placing an arm over his RPG bag.*

Dawn: "Keep all data found by their fight with it-" *Her words caused several researchers to run around the room.*

Researcher: *She stood in front of Dawn.* "The opponent, there was no distinguishable affinity-"

Dawn: *She intentionally ignored the researcher and frowned in deep concentration, looking over her shoulder.* "And calculate the differences from previous encounters. Also, don't forget the fight with the Champion, Nathan, Karol, Luna, in The Twilight Forest!"

Four Researchers: "Yes ma'am!" *They spoke at the same time, lowering their heads in research.*

Dawn: *She snapped her fingers, pointing to a man in white researcher-like garments.* "Don't forget the forbidden Remenistal activated in Synthoss' blood!"

Researcher: "The Black Brigade?"

Dawn: "Of course! Research needs to find out how she's activated the royal bloodline's ability!"

Researcher: "Ma'am."

Dawn: "I'll find out how she manipulated powers to that of a number two captain!"

Researcher: *He discreetly looked at Dawn in the corner of his eyes, typing in a worried manner.* "You seem to be very stressed-"

Dawn: "For research, leave me be!" *She spoke rudely to the researcher and turned around, causing her to notice Tyler at the door.* "If it isn't the little, smart one."

Tyler: "H-Hi-"

Dawn: *She smiled and sighed in an exhausted manner, walking up to him.* "Can I help you?"

Tyler: *He formed a fist near his mouth and coughed.* "I-I just wanted your permission to use one of your consoles for my own research?" *He nervously looked away in a cute-like manner.*

Dawn: *She tilted her head at an angle, pulling a facial expression as if she wanted to hug him.* "Of course you can."

Tyler: "Thank you." *He looked around the room, noticing a vacant Rosterology console.*

Dawn: "Excuse my bad attitude, research and I have been through a lot. What brings you here?"

Tyler: (Whatever happened to me that day-) *He unintentionally ignored Dawn, mumbling in recollection.* (That time when we all..-)

Dawn: *She watched Tyler drag his feet to the console.* (That face... It's a researcher's thought in progress, I can relate-) *She coughed with a discreet smirk, catching Tyler's attention.*

Tyler: "Oh?" *He paused, looking over his shoulder to Dawn.*

Dawn: "Before you delve into your work, how's things on your end with the Consultant?"

Tyler: "We found out about his weakness, but I haven't been able to find out when."

Dawn: "Wow, what is it?"

Tyler: "The Rubistral Moon."

Dawn: "That sounds great for research!"

Tyler: "Yeah, we discovered that it happens in cycles."

Dawn: (They've found out about the Consultant's weakness... The Consultant... And we haven't found anything! I need to focus back on our task!)

Tyler: "The timing is crucial because-"

Dawn: *She coughed and shook her head as if it no longer interested her.* "Well, let me know if you need anything."

Tyler: *He paused and nodded his head in understanding.* (She was obviously in the middle of something-) "You too.. I've got good knowledge on a lot of things, if you ever find yourself needing another set of eyes-"

Dawn: "I may take you up on that offer if I ever do need it." *She adjusted the professional-like glasses on her face.*

Tyler: "O-Of course." *He smiled and sat down in front of the Rosterology console, ensuring to keep eye contact for respect.*

Dawn: "I will leave you be, research waits for no man!" *She spoke under her breath and nodded her head, before storming away.*

Tyler: "Thank you." *He smiled in appreciation and faced the screen, suddenly looking serious.* (I want to know what the heck happened back then...)

Dawn: *She stopped next to a researcher who typed at a quick pace and hovered over her shoulder, staring at the screen.* "Any luck?"

Researcher: "None thus."

Dawn: *She impatiently gritted her teeth and looked away.* "Let me know what research says otherwise."

Researcher: "Yes, ma'am." *She resumed her quick typing, intensely staring at the screen.*

Tyler: (When that strange occurrence happened... Nothing happened for me, and only me..) *He mumbled to himself, recalling Chrisma's Healing Rings, Lance's Subzero Volt and Alicia's Ice Dragoon.*

*Tyler removed the RPG from off his head and gently placed it next to him, leaning it against the chair.*

Tyler: "Okay.." *He twiddled his fingers and leant over a keyboard-like screen, quickly typing in an experienced manner.* "Ra-gna-rok."

Rosterology Screen: "Searching.."

Tyler: (I might not have even spelt it right-)

Rosterology Screen: "Eight hundred-dash, results found."

Tyler: "Eight-?" *He leant back, looking at the screen surprised.* "How about-?" *He typed again, sticking his tongue out in thought.*

Rosterology Screen: "One-dash, result found."

Tyler: (Ragnarok, Ougi, and I get one result.)

*The screen changed colour and showed an image of a man with grey hair.*

Tyler: (Who is this man? He's wearing ancient, Greek-like clothing, and holding a crossbow-) *His eyes drifted from side to side, as he scanned the text next to the picture.*

Dawn: *She leant back on a manager-like table and watched the researchers lean into their work, listening to the constant sounds of typing in the room.* (So much as happened recently...)

Tyler: *He leant closer to the screen and smiled.* (Wow, interesting.) *He wiggled his bottom on the seat in excitement, making himself more comfortable.* (Ragnarok, a master crafter said to have created the most powerful man-made weapon.)

*Tyler frowned with concentration, ignoring several high-heel sounding footsteps which echoed from the corridor.*

Tyler: (Not much is known about how the weapon works, but it's said it calls upon the surrounding Astragons for unlimited energy.)

*Several researchers came into the facility holding mugs, carefully blowing rising steam away from them.*

Tyler: (It was said, he made the weapon to help win-) *He shook his head in confusion, as he reread the sentence.* (-A triad war? On his last words he said, no man could harness the weapon's power-)

*Tyler scrolled past of an image of a weapon changing shape, cueing him to read another passage.*

Tyler: (He was confident in his words due to being a Diareamer, he remembered the words The Voice of On told him. In order to harness the power, hearing their voice is a requirement.)

*Tyler scratched an only pimple on his face, scrolling to the next page.*

Tyler: (Their voice acts as a key, to understand how it works.) "This log doesn't make any sense to me." *He mumbled, continuing to read the text.*

Researcher Woman: "I found the affinity levels of the surrounding Scoldrants, like requested, ma'am."

Dawn: "Excellent, research prevails."

Tyler: (People were fixated on his strength, despite being a Diareamer, he could not wield the power of Remenistal nor was a bender of elements-)

*Tyler stared at the same man wielding an enormous crossbow.*

Tyler: (Shortly before his death, he laughed at anyone who tried to copy his reign of glory, he even mumbled the ingredients to the weapon.) "The ingredients? So Ragnarok is a weapon that can be created?"

*Tyler spoke in confusion and continued to mumble to himself in fascination.*

Dawn: "Could I also get a detailed list of all known Azure Bursts for Grey? He requested a new battle log book to be published shortly." *She watched several researchers nod their heads in acknowledgement.*

Tyler: (The ingredients...) *He blew through his mouth, concentrating on the text.* (Mythril, Scoldrant's bone and Tyrant's fluid-)

*Tyler leant back and sighed in a defeated manner, slowly shaking his head.*

Tyler: "What on Earth is a Tyrant's fluid?" *He grumbled to himself, scratching his head in recollection.*

Dawn: *She placed her hands on her waist and looked across the facility at the working researchers.* (Things are running smoothly around here, even with all the drama and grief we've been put through.)

Tyler: (What unusual ingredients.) *He stood up and started to walk out of the facility in a trance-like state.*

Dawn: *She watched Tyler walk towards the door, noticing the RPG bag on the floor next to his seat.* "You forgot your bag."

Tyler: *He glanced at Dawn before walking out of the facility.* "I'll be back, thank you for letting me know anyway."

Dawn: "For research!" *She fist pumped the air above her, causing her to quickly adjust her glasses.*

----------

Nathan: (Part of me was hoping he'd just leave.) *He listened to their footsteps crunch on dry leaves as they quietly walked through the forest.*

Lance: "The ground was covered in orange, red and brown leaves-"

Nathan: "You've been doing that stupid Lezard thing for ages, he's not here, quit it-"

Lance: *He pointed at falling leaves like a child.* "As strong gusts of wind blew across the forest, it caused the area to rain leaves."

Nathan: (The more I've grown to love Lezard like a brother, the less his traits didn't bother me. I've only just noticed, when this guy started doing it, how much it infuriates me.)

Lance: "Several trees had no leaves, which gave the forest a sense of loneliness."

Nathan: (The forest? He's a tree whisperer?) *He rolled his eyes.*

Lance: *He looked to his side at Nathan, raising an eyebrow in boredom.* "So to break this silence, are ya goin' to tell me about the sword?"

Nathan: ".. Well, my current sword-" *He touched the sword, which was tied to his waist.*

Lance: "Nice-"
Nathan: "-Is made of mythril, which is the strongest alloy a sword can have. But The Sword of Memories' is far superior to mythril."

Lance: "Aye? Wat does that mean?"

Nathan: "It can slice through any other weapon, including this one."

Lance: "Kool." *He looked up, watching orange and red leaves rustle in the wind.*

Nathan: "It can make a novice sword user, be in the league of masters."

Lance: "Wat makes it so, kool?" *He said the word cool in a different tone as if he wasn't sure what word to say.*

Nathan: "They say it contains the skills of multiple users."

Lance: "Hence the name, Sword of Memories, I get it. Too bad for you, I'll get to use it with my awesome skills."

Nathan: *He stopped, causing leaves to crunch under his feet.* "You're giving me the impression you think you're better than me?" *He touched the handle of his sword, waiting for Lance's response.*

Lance: "Oh really? I am." *He smirked and faced Nathan.*

Nathan: "Then-" *He looked to the side and noticed two walls of bricks leading to an entrance underground, before focusing on thick vines which crawled along the walls.* "Should we warm ourselves up before we enter the-..?"

Lance: (It's the entrance! We got here so fast, aye! I remember it took me, Ash, Millard and Teresa so long to get here.)

Nathan: (The..?) *He pointed at the entrance of The Unknown Territory as if he didn't know what it was called.*

Lance: "Thingy?"

Nathan: "Yeah." *He shrugged his shoulders as if he was happy with that answer.*

Lance: "Alright." *He reached behind his back and pulled his arm forward, causing sparks to scatter around his withered looking sword.*

Nathan: (That sword..) "Look at the condition of your weapon."

Lance: "Yea, wat about it?"

Nathan: "A sword user's abilities and self-respect can be distinguished through their weapon. Yours is old, chipped and very unappealing-"

Lance: "Wat are ya tryin' to say?" *He looked offended and unsure how to respond.*

Nathan: "You fight with no respect."

Lance: "And, you'll be gettin' none of that either-"

Nathan: (They act the same, but I can tell the slight differences between him and Luna.) *He inhaled deeply as he tried to control his emotions.* "This is a warm-up."

Lance: "Right?"

Nathan: "So whatever happens when we get the sword, I'll be happy to fight you seriously then?"

Lance: "So, we fight for real when we get the sword? Sounds like a plan to me." *He pointed the sword at Nathan.*

Nathan: "Hemph." *He sighed with disrespect and unsheathed his sword.*

Lance: "Umm, ready when you are?"

Nathan: "I'm-" *He gripped the sword with both hands and jumped forward into striking distance.* "-Ready."

Lance: *He raised the sword, readying to block Nathan's sword swing.* "Wat a lousy stri-"

Nathan: *He hit Lance's sword and sliced to the side, pushing him back.* "Hemph-"

Lance: *He took several steps back with widening eyes, staring at Nathan.* "Huh?"

Nathan: *He ignored the recoil-like sound which echoed from Lance's sword.* "You're meant to say, worthless?" *He jumped forward back into striking distance, raising the sword.*

Lance: "Tssk-" (He pushed me back!) *He raised his sword in a defensive manner.*

Nathan: *He struck downwards and his sword came to a halt on Lance's sword.* "You're able to hold your own."

Lance: (He's so damned strong!)

*Lance took another step back, crunching more leaves under his foot.*

Nathan: "I guess you're stronger than you look-"

Lance: "Y-Yea-" *He grunted through his gritted teeth.*
Nathan: "Hermph-" *He struck his sword across, pushing Lance back onto his side.*

Lance: *He squinted his eyes as the falling orange leaves flapped over his arm.* "Tssk-" *His feet dragged along the dirt ground, before coming to a stop.*

Nathan: *He ignored the leaves, which spiralled off the ground caused by the commotion.* (Some people think that warming up is not smart as you waste energy, while others including me like to stretch their muscles first. From experience, it's more beneficial in the long run.)

Lance: *He regained his posture and stood straight, holding the sword with both hands.* "Wow, not bad-"

Nathan: "Can we not talk?" *He ran towards Lance, raising the sword in the air.*

Lance: (Cocky bastard-) *He jumped to his side and rolled on the ground, catching Nathan off guard.*

Nathan: *He looked down with widening eyes.* (What kind of stance is that-?)
Lance: "Grr-" *He leant on one knee, slicing across Nathan's side.*

Nathan: (Damn!-) *He quickly flicked his wrist and the sword jabbed into the dirt, blocking Lance's strike.* (Releasing or dropping the sword from your hand isn't good in battle, but sometimes you've got no choice-)

Lance: *He withdrew his sword and jumped behind Nathan with a frown.* (He threw the sword into the ground and blocked my strike!-)

Nathan: (He went for my side that I left completely open-) *He quickly turned around and noticed Lance's sword heading directly towards his head.*

Lance: (I'll scratch his face, so I can-)

Nathan: *He ripped the sword out from the ground, causing clumps of dirt to flick into the air.* (See if you can comprehend this sword technique-) *He moved at heightened speeds and spun around, tightening his grip on the sword.*

Lance: *He watched Nathan spin around with his arm and sword extended, blatantly missing him.* (Huh? Where was he strikin'-?)

Nathan: "Hmph-" *He smirked, watching Lance continue his lunge-like motion towards him.*
Lance: "Ha! You missed!-" *His arm wobbled and he watched his strike move away from Nathan.* "Wha-?"

Nathan: *He looked to his side as Lance leant forward in confusion.* (By slicing the air, it causes different patches of resistance, so he doesn't understand how he just completely missed me-)

Lance: (I missed just like him? But-) *He stared at the tip of his sword with a dropping jaw.* (Why did I-?)

Nathan: *He smirked to himself and jumped forward, pointing the sword at Lance.* "Hmph."

Lance: *He quickly faced Nathan and stepped back for support, raising the sword in a defensive manner.* (Tssk, I want to attack him already-)

Nathan: *He slashed Lance back and forth with ease, listening to violent ching-like sounds echo with each hit.* (He's able to hold his own-)

Lance: *He quickly swayed to each side, blocking Nathan's elegant sword strikes.* (This guy!)

Nathan: (But for someone who doesn't fight with respect, he will never understand the ways of the sword.)

Lance: *He gritted his teeth, as sparks flashed off his sword with every strike Nathan landed.* (He's good, I'll give him that-)

Nathan: *He firmly held onto the sword with widening eyes.* (Critical!) *He leant back and sliced downwards with his shoulders.*

Lance: *He flashstepped to the side of Nathan and slashed the air across Nathan's face.* "..."

Nathan: "Flashstep?!" *He looked to the side with widening eyes and flashstepped to the ground on all fours in front of Lance.* "Double Slash." *He raised the sword and pointed it at Lance.*

Lance: *He gasped like a girl and stepped back.* "C-Crap-?"

Nathan: (Gotcha!-)
Lance: *He noticed Nathan's sword didn't move, giving him time to step back out of striking distance.* "Ya know, you've got to swing the sword to damage-" *He suddenly coughed and bent forward in pain.*

Nathan: "Hermph." *He closed his eyes with growing confidence and slowly stood up straight.*

Lance: "Ah, you got me?!" *He coughed again, feeling himself in confusion.*

Nathan: "That's enough of a warm-up, don't you think?" *He smirked and sheathed the sword back into its scabbard.*

Lance: "How did you-?!"

Nathan: "You're fine, I didn't cut you deeply-"

Lance: "Cut?!" *He grunted in confusion, shaking his head.* "You didn't move your sword, flamin' shit nuggets-"

Nathan: (Everything I've experienced.) *He lowered his arms and faced the entrance to The Unknown Territory.* (Attempting to best Rostical Users, it makes fighting another swordsman rather easy-)

Lance: *He grunted in a dissatisfied-like manner, pointing at Nathan as if he cheated.* "Nah, you didn't even move your arm?"

Nathan: "I've mastered that Azure Burst. I moved the sword and my arm at blinding speeds."

Lance: ".. True-" *He stood up straight and placed the sword behind his back.* "Well, I hate to say, but that's pretty kool." *He smirked as the sword became invisible.*

Nathan: "So I see you're bleeding a little." *He pointed to a cross-like cut on Lance's arm, causing him to smirk in a victorious manner.*

Lance: *He placed his hand on his arm to hide the wound, noticing a thin cut on Nathan's cheek.* "You're bleedin', too." *He walked past Nathan and towards the temple's entrance, listening to the leaves crunch under his feet.*

Nathan: "Hmm?" *He touched his cheek, noticing a speck of blood on the tip of his finger.* (Not bad.) *He grunted in a proud manner and turned around, quickly following Lance.*

Lance: *He continued to walk forward, noticing the brown-green vines dangling around the entrance.* (I wonder-)

Nathan: (I wasn't born yesterday, I could tell from Arcadia's body language that I could be facing danger in here..) *He opened and closed a fist.* (That's why I wanted a warm-up, to get the Neurons flowing through my muscles.)

Lance: *He looked down at the entrance, noticing a moss-covered staircase which led downwards.* "Kool."

Nathan: *He slowed down, staring at Lance's back with growing caution.* "What is it?"

Lance: "I was kinda worryin' that the entrance wouldn't be open."

Nathan: "Why? What makes you say that?"

Lance: "I don't know-" *He had a flashback of him stepping on a trap sealing the entrance.*

Nathan: "It's open, so it doesn't matter."

Lance: *He nodded his head, placing his hands on his head.* "I gathered by my friend's reactions, that the Unknown thingys collapsed after Zayden activated the glyphs."

Nathan: "I vaguely heard that they did collapse actually." (By one of the members of The Black Brigade-)

Lance: "Yea, see." *He grunted and walked down the stone stairs, watching his step.* "Watch your step, aye. Don't wanna be one of them idiots that activates the traps."

Nathan: "Traps? Got it." *He ducked under and avoided the vines while stepping down the stairs.* "So, have I fought you at Battling Oxident?"

Lance: "Nah, I don't think so. I don't remember fighting many sword users like myself."

Nathan: (On our level?) "Same." *He followed Lance into the temple, noticing all the sounds start to echo.*

----------

*Several people sat around square tables in a library-like room, reading ridiculously thick books.*

Tyler: *He sat on a square table by himself surrounded by several books, which lay open on the table.* (Tyrant's fluid, a special fluid from aquatic Scoldrants. The main ingredient used to form shape of Rosterology items.) "Hmm, interesting." *He gently lowered the book and reached for another.*

*A man who wore a green Scoldrant-shaped hat, shuffled down the bookshelves.*

Tyler: (Tyrant's fluid are rare, but common in crafting or weapon zones.) "Hmm?" *He closed the books and neatly stacked them, slowly standing up as if he had something planned.*

----------

*Brown leaves pulsed away from Nathan and Lance's feet, gliding across the damp floor inside the temple.*

Lance: "Not this mazy corridor thing again."

Nathan: "Not so loud, your voice echoes in my ear like ten times."

Lance: "Ten? I think someone is over exaggerating." *He rolled his eyes, purposely raising his voice.*

Nathan: *He looked annoyed, causing slight wrinkles to appear above his nose.* "Just focus on getting the sword."

Lance: "Yea, I can say the same to you."

----------

Tyler: *He faced Dawn and two researchers, as they stood outside the research facility.* "Any idea?"

Dawn: "Hmm." *She looked down and hummed in thought, holding her glasses by one hand with two fingers.* "There's definitely a weapon shop on the lower level of the city." *She looked up at Tyler, handing over his RPG bag.*

Tyler: "On the lower level?"

Dawn: "Yes, near the end."

Tyler: "Oh great, thank you."

Dawn: "So what were you doing in there?" *She leant to the side, looking past Tyler at the library.*

Tyler: "I was reading a few books with topics I didn't find in the databanks. And whoever decided to build the library across the room to the research facility is-" *He paused as he tried to find the appropriate word.* "Awesome."

Dawn: "Yeah, research has its ways." *She smiled in appreciation as if it was her idea.*

Tyler: *He adjusted the RPG bag and put the strap over his shoulder, resting one arm over it.* "I will be back shortly, I'm thinking about seeing Season at Surpreon."

Dawn: "I'm sure that could be arranged."

Tyler: "Great." *He smiled and turned around, looking down the corridor.* "Thank you, again."

Dawn: "We have to help our allies-"

*A researcher ran out of the facility, instantly catching Dawn's attention.*

Dawn: *She stepped to the side, facing the researcher.* "Is the Azure Burst list completed?"

*The researcher nodded her head, causing Dawn to power walk into the facility.*

Tyler: *He walked on a mission down the corridor and hopped down the stairs.* (Alright, so if this person has this fluid then I can obtain all three ingredients with ease.)

*Tyler smiled in thought and looked down the second level, before hopping down the next set of stairs.*

----------

Nathan: *He tried not to touch the walls, keeping to himself.* "Everything is very narrow and confined."

Lance: "Oh, quit your sookin'."

Nathan: "I'm not sooking, I'm merely stating a fact."

Lance: "Facts, borin', you sound like Teresa-"

Nathan: "What did you say?"

Lance: "Wateva."

Nathan: (He is incredibly immature. In comparison, I don't think Lezard is immature, he's just him. This guy really gets on my nerve.) "Let's just continue, we're getting closer, I can feel it now."

Lance: "Are you a Scoldrant User, how can you feel it?" *He rolled his eyes, smirking in a cocky manner.*

Nathan: *He leant forward and spun Lance around by his shoulder, grabbing his neck.* "Don't-"

Lance: "Wha-?"
Nathan: *He slammed Lance against the rock wall, slightly leaning forward in an intimidating-like manner.* "-Ever talk or class me as something. I'm Nathan, simple as that."

Lance: *He looked shocked.* "Yea, it's fine. I don't like people givin' me titles either."

Nathan: (Now his attitude has changed again? Maybe he's immature by choice?) *He looked surprised, slowly letting go of Lance.* "Really?"

Lance: "Yea, I didn't know you were the type of guy-" *He coughed while rubbing his neck.* "-To care about somethin' like that, to be honest."

Nathan: "Oh, sure." *He sounded regretful of his actions and awkwardly walked past Lance, continuing down the corridor.*

Lance: (Maybe I should act more mellow around him?) *He cleared his throat while looking at Nathan's back.*

*Nathan and Lance quietly walked through the maze-like temple, listening to their differently sounding footsteps echo off the tight stone walls.*

Lance: "We arh.." *He coughed to clear his throat again.* "I went a different way to this, I almost got there instantly." *He implied to take the other route behind him.*

Nathan: (My instincts have never let me down when it's come to exploration or the terrain.) "Maybe, but the other ways were dead ends, or had traps." *He sounded sure of himself as if he could tell which were the wrong ways to go.*

Lance: (Maybe it was a one-time-only-way type thing, or-) *He scratched the back of his head and looked back, while awkwardly following Nathan.* (I dunno, it's not important to worry over.)

----------

*Tyler listened to the sounds of a water fountain, entering a garage-like facility.*

Tyler: "H-Hello?" *He yelled out, nervously looking around for a response.*

Blacksmith: "Ah, good day, hermm." *He grunted and hobbled towards Tyler from another room.*

Tyler: "H-Hello."

Blacksmith: "How can I help you? Need some smithery done on your weapons, hermm?" *He tried to wipe several grease-like smears off his face with the back of his hand.*

Tyler: "A-Actually, I'm here for an ingredient."

Blacksmith: *He wiped his forehead with his arm, trying not to use his fingers.* "Like what, hermm?"

Tyler: "Tyrant's fluid?"

Blacksmith: "Hmm, I've got some, what have you got in return?"

Tyler: "R-Return?" *He sounded surprised as if he wasn't expecting to give something back.*

Blacksmith: "Did you think I'd give you some rare material for nothing?"

Tyler: (Actually I did expect that, how bad of myself to assume that.)

Blacksmith: "Well? Are you wasting my time, hermm?"

Tyler: "U-Umm-" *He looked down, patting the RPG bag with the arm he rested it on.* "I've got berries, scanners, Genesis Stones, I've even got-"

Blacksmith: "Did you say, Genesis Stones?" *He lowered his arms, leaning forward in interest.*

Tyler: "Yes?"

Blacksmith: "How'd you get one of them, hermm?" *He sounded excited.*

Tyler: "I crafted them."

Blacksmith: "But how?"

Tyler: "When there were lightning storms."

Blacksmith: "I use them as energy sources to run this place." *He swayed his arms around the garage-like area, looking up to the ceiling at the lights.* "Unlike the old days, I'll never go back to using my own Neurons again, hermm."

Tyler: "Yes." *He nodded his head in a mature manner, acknowledging what the man was saying.*

Blacksmith: "I'm running low and I've been meaning to get some for a while now-" *He sighed, wiping his forehead with his arm again.* "But I've been very busy creating all these weapons, hermm."

Tyler: "Sure, I can give you five, if you let me use your facility, help me out a bit, and-"

Blacksmith: "The use of the Tyrant's fluid?"

Tyler: "Yes?"

Blacksmith: "That sounds like a fair deal to me! You'll be saving me a lot of money by giving me those stones."

Tyler: "Great, I need mythril, and Scoldrant bones too."

Blacksmith: "I've got plenty of Mythril, as that's the trademark of Silver Wind Island."

Tyler: "Excellent, and what about the Scoldrant bones?"

Blacksmith: "And Scoldrant bones are needed for several shields I make, hermm."

Tyler: "Thank you, I appreciate your kindness."

Blacksmith: "I'm also grateful for those Genesis Stones."

Tyler: (I was a little scared that this guy or girl might've been some mean, butch person.) *He sighed in relief as the Blacksmith led him into the facility.* (I see I still have some old habits from Earth.)

----------

Nathan: *He observed the walls, allowing Lance to impatiently shuffle past him.* (That's another trap.. People designed structures like this temple by creating the paths to get to the throne room and then expanding the temple or sanctums around them. By doing this, with trained eyes, you can tell which is the right way to go.)

Lance: (He's obsessed with checking every single room or hallway we pass-) *He walked in front of Nathan and stepped around a blind corner, noticing a large room to his left.* (Maybe he can tell wat ways are dead ends, aye.)

Nathan: *He shook his head and observed the area in detail, following the sounds of Lance's footsteps.* (Nothing so far.)

Lance: *He instantly noticed the five glyphs, which were engraved on the walls.* "There?!" *He whispered under his breath with widening eyes.*

Nathan: "We're close, I know it.." *He walked towards the end of the path.*

Lance: (I remember-) *He stopped at the doorway and turned around, waiting for Nathan to step into his line of sight.*

Nathan: *He walked around the blind corner, noticing Lance's facial expression.* (His face!-) "Is this it?"

Lance: "Yea-" *He turned back around and walked into the room, slightly smiling in a nostalgic-like manner.*

Nathan: *He observed the walls.* (Looks like the way to go-)

Lance: *He stopped in the room and placed his hands on his head.* "Well, this is where the glyph was, but I didn't remember seein' a sword then.. And I don't now."

Nathan: *He loosely followed Lance into the room, causing his metal belts to jingle.* "Maybe it's in a secret compartment? This is definitely the throne room."

Lance: "That would sound about right." *He lowered his arms and playfully kicked the air, while looking around the room.*

Nathan: *The tip of his foot tripped on a ridged line on the ground, catching his attention.* "A glyph?" *He looked up to Lance, staring at his back.*

Lance: "Yea, they used to be glowing, aye."

Nathan: "No-" *He focused his attention to his feet.* "What's this?"

Lance: *He stared at the glyphs on the wall, picking his nose in thought.* "Yea, I dunno aye." *He didn't pay attention to Nathan, focusing all his attention on the wall.* (It seems so long ago when we travelled together, Ash.. I miss you so much.)

Nathan: *He bent down on all fours and blew dirt away, gently rubbing the ridged line.* (It's a massive glyph-)

*Nathan paused and followed the line with his eyes, scanning the ground in a circular motion.*

Nathan: (It circles around in the middle of the throne room.)

Lance: *He walked closer to the wall, placing his hand on the glyphs.* (They ain't glowin' anymore.. Is it 'cause they've served their purpose?)

Nathan: *He closely inspected the lines, taking mental notes.* (To give me a better chance against Rostical Users, Ginger showed me diagrams of different glyphs for each Rostical affinity.)

Lance: (Being here gives me memories of Ash and Millard..)

Nathan: (So this glyph rings around.. Ginger said rings are usually used for supportive Rostical. Maybe this does something to reveal the sword?)

Lance: *He sighed and faced Nathan, shaking his head.* "There isn't that much here, maybe it's in another room?"

Nathan: "Are you sure your information was correct? About it being in The Ancient Forest? There are another four Unknown Territories you know." *He grunted, as he continued to inspect the ground.*

Lance: "He-" *He paused and thought of Locki.* "My information is definitely correct, aye."

Nathan: *He kept blowing dirt away on the ground.* "Okay."

Lance: *He watched Nathan crawl to the middle of the room, causing him to grunt in disgust.* "Seriously, get up."

Nathan: *He felt the ground and instantly stopped.* "Hey!" *He leant up, keeping one hand on the ground.* "I think I found something."

Lance: "Serious?" *He quickly jogged over to Nathan and looked down, staring at lines in confusion.* "Wat am I lookin' at?"

Nathan: (It's old.) *He closed his eyes, placing both hands together on the ground.* (It might even just be designed for architecture purposes-)

Lance: "Umm, I don't see anythin'-?"

Nathan: (Glyphs already engraved or drawn on things just need Neurons.. Similar to the teleportation devices Dawn gives us..)

Lance: "Uh, hello?"

Nathan: (It's really old.. But maybe it will work-) *The glyph made an unlocking sound, as Neurons poured into the glyph.*

Lance: "Whoa, you actually found somethin'." *He sounded surprised and listened to awakening mechanical-like sounds.*

Nathan: *He opened his eyes, purposely keeping in pose.* "You, doubted, me?" *He spoke with pauses as he focused all his attention on the glyph.*

Lance: "Yea." *He grumbled in disrespect, folding his arms like a child.*

Nathan: "You better start showing me respect-" *The glyph shined purple and started to rotate, causing the ground to move.*

*Sounds of stone moving and rocks crushing could be heard, as small dirt clouds puffed out of the ground.*

Lance: "Whoa-" *He stumbled and fell backwards onto the floor.* "It feels like an earthquake."

Nathan: "Earth? Quake?"

Lance: "Oh, not now-"

*The floor stopped moving and suddenly released a bright purple flash, blinding Nathan and Lance.*

-

Nathan: "Ah-" *He moaned, lying motionless on the ground.* (It just used a large amount of Neurons to activate!-)

Lance: "Shit..." *He rubbed his head and groaned.* "-Nuggets.."

Nathan: (Why did it take so much out of me?) *He noticed a change in the room.* (We teleported!)

Lance: *He looked around with blurred vision.* "It's darker than normal in 'ere."

Nathan: *He coughed and sneezed, managing to stand back on his feet.* "That was-"
Lance: "Shit?" *He grunted under his breath, rubbing his eyes.*

Nathan: *He stood up straight and placed a hand on his shoulder, cracking his neck.* "That was different from a normal teleportation glyph-"

*A beam of light which shined in the middle of a small room caused Nathan to stop in mid-sentence.*

Lance: "Wat?" *He shook his head and sniffed, standing up in a disorientated manner.*

Nathan: "The Sword of Memories." *He grunted under his breath as he stared at a floating sword.*

Lance: *He quickly became alert and faced the sword, watching specks of dust drift past the beam of light.* (It's floating in the light.)

Nathan: *He quickly ran up and grabbed the sword, causing another blast of purple light to blind them.* "Argh-"
Lance: "Gah-?!" *He crossed his arms, covering his eyes.*

Nathan: *He heard leaves rustling in the wind, causing him to blink several times.* "Huh?"

Lance: *His hair blew in the wind, causing him to rub his eyes in disorientation and frustration.* "We're outside now?"

Nathan: (It teleported us outside? Maybe it was a defence mechanism.)

Lance: "That's lame! But I guess it saves us the walk out."

Nathan: *He slowly swayed the sword in front, causing the sword to make a holy surreal-like sound.* "Wow, it's amazing. It feels like a feather and at the same time it feels sturdy and power-"

Lance: "Wait, no! I want the sword."

Nathan: *He smirked, waving the sword in Lance's direction.* "You want it?"

Lance: *He reached behind his back and paused.* "Yea, I do."

*Nathan and Lance stared at each other, as a gust of wind filled with bright red leaves blew past them.*

----------

*Waves of sparks flew past the Blacksmith and Tyler's head, as a constant saw-like noise echoed in the garage-like facility.*

Tyler: *He wore protective clothing, which was covered in black grease smears.* (This is hot.) *He intensely looked down at the sparks, as sweat dripped off his face.*

Blacksmith: *He leant back, causing the sparks and sound to stop.* "The ingredients mixed perfectly, let them settle and you get to choose its shape."

Tyler: *He relaxed his posture and lowered a Rosterology device he was using to heat the ingredients.* "Mixed already?" *He sounded exhausted, slowly blowing through his mouth.*

Blacksmith: "You've been at it for some time, give yourself some praise."

Tyler: *He lifted up the face shield and sighed with an accomplished smile.* "Great, thank you for your work."

Blacksmith: "Any time. I'm waiting for the swords I recently crafted to cool down before I'm able to transfer them." *He implied he had nothing to do anyway.*

Tyler: "Ha ha, sure." *He nodded his head, watching the Blacksmith walk away.* (Now, for my lessons-) "I'll be back shortly."

Blacksmith: *His back faced Tyler, as he inspected the swords.* "Take your time, it won't settle for a while, hermm." *He picked up a shard of crystal, waving Tyler away.*

Tyler: (I've got three long-range weapons in mind.) *He walked near a workbench and gently placed the Rosterology device on it, picking up his RPG bag.*

Blacksmith: *He started to scrape the swords with the shard of crystal, causing sparks to scatter.* (That man, he surprised me-)

Tyler: *He walked through the garage-like facility and stepped outside, squinting his eyes due to the sunlight.* (Okay, my time management has been great.)

*Tyler adjusted the strap to the RPG bag and inhaled deeply.*

Tyler: (Ashton, you would be proud.)

Blacksmith: *He grunted, as he continued to scrape the crystal against the swords.* (I dislike those snobby researchers who think they're better than everyone else, but he was different, hermm.)

*The Blacksmith wiped sweat off his forehead with the back of his hand, grunting in approval.*

Tyler: *He opened the flap to the RPG bag and reached inside, pulling out an ordinary, wooden bow.* "I will practice in their research facility."

*Tyler spoke to himself and stepped around the water fountain, beginning his long walk back to the castle.*

----------

Lance: *He frowned and ignored scattering sparks, while pointing his sword at Nathan.* "Grr-"

Nathan: "I think you're underestimating The Sword of Memories."

Lance: "I think you're underestimatin' me."

Nathan: "Do you really want to go through with this? I will try this time."

Lance: "Yea, I want that sword."

Nathan: "Then, with honour, you may go first."

Lance: *He firmly held the sword, as his facial expression became serious.* "Make me strike first? You're seriously askin' for a beating."

Nathan: *He smirked, as he lined the sword with his face.* (He's confident.)

----------

Dawn: *She watched Tyler standing on a platform on the far end of the facility.* (I like how he delves into his work with such passion.. But, if he wanted to practise, why not go to The Entarlia Dome?)

Tyler: *He stood in an empty field of pale-green grass.* (Unlike our research facility, they have a Reality Sekai platform. We should definitely use one of these back home-.. I mean, Surpreon.)

*Tyler held the bow and carefully examined it, stepping forward on the grass.*

Tyler: (This is a steep learning curve-)

Dawn: *She looked in a monitor and observed him pulling the string to the bow with an arrow.* (This is the drive of someone that respects research, too.)

Researcher: "Dawn." *He drifted her attention to the paperwork in his hand.*

Tyler: *He pointed and aimed the arrow at a bullseye in front of him.* (I was never good at hand-eye coordination.)

*The bullseye stood on a wooden, tripod-like holder with several holes already in it.*

Tyler: *He tilted his head and let go of the string.* "..." *He watched the arrow fly towards the bullseye, causing him to smile.* "Yes?!"

*Tyler gasped with anticipation, watching the arrow miss the target.*

Tyler: "Oh.. I missed altogether."

Researcher: *She looked over to Tyler, watching him pull the string to his bow back.* (I haven't used the Reality Sekai simulator he's on. Only childish immature warriors use things like that.) *She rolled her eyes, focusing her attention back to the screen in front of her.*

Tyler: *An arrow appeared in between his fingers.* (Now!) *He fired the arrow and watched it completely miss the target.* "Gee-whiz! I missed... It was even further away than last time!"

Dawn: *She glanced at Tyler placing the bow back into his RPG bag, before pulling out a large crossbow.* (A crossbow-?)

Researcher: *He looked at Dawn puzzled.* "A brain like yourself is interested in weapons?"

Dawn: "Oh, no. I once used a crossbow myself, for research."

Researcher: "Really?"

Dawn: "But, that's the past. Focus on the digits, you're losing time!" *She sounded annoyed, which prompted the researcher to get back to work.*

Tyler: (Actually, before I test out the easiest option, this crossbow, I should use my other selection-)

*Tyler shoved his free hand into the RPG bag, pulling out a handful of daggers.*

*A researcher walked into the room holding a stack of paperwork and noticed Tyler, pointing towards the roof with nothing in his hand.*

Dawn: *She looked back into the monitor, noticing the daggers.* (He's going through a process of elimination. Reminds me of when I learned how to harness my Ougi.)

Tyler: (Okay-) *He frowned with confidence and aimed the daggers, throwing them all in one arm swing.*

*Tyler watched the daggers stab into the ground just in front of him.*

Tyler: "Oh.." (Well, I'm glad nobody saw that-) *He awkwardly stuttered in thought, raising the crossbow.*

*The researcher shook his head at Tyler and walked towards Dawn.*

Tyler: *He pulled the string back which automatically clipped the arrow into place.* (This doesn't cause strain on my fingers like the normal bow.)

*Tyler half smirked and held a handle at the bottom of the crossbow, readying to fire the arrow.*

Tyler: "Now-"

Chrisma: "Tyler!" *She jumped next to him, causing him to shoot the crossbow upwards.*

Tyler: *He looked up, trying to see where the arrow was fired.* (Where did it go-?)

Chrisma: "Whoup whoup!"

Tyler: "Chrisma?" *He lowered his head as if he didn't want to be disturbed.*

Chrisma: *She rudely inspected the area, stamping her feet on the grass.* "Is this real?"

Tyler: "It's a simulator, similar to Battling Oxident."

Chrisma: "Oh, wow-" *A strange honk interrupted her, causing her to look around in confusion.*

Tyler: "Huh?" *A duck-like Scoldrant fell out of the sky and landed on the ground with an arrow poking out of its belly.*

*Tyler and Chrisma silently stared at the motionless Scoldrant.*

Chrisma: "Did I-?" *She groaned, pointing at the Scoldrant.*

Tyler: "Yeah." *He nodded his head, staring at the Scoldrant.*

Chrisma: *She awkwardly pointed behind her.* "I think I'll just go over here now."

Tyler: *He watched her quickly leave the area, causing him to sigh in relief.* (I have full confidence in my research, but, I'm having no luck with these long-range weapons. So, even if my work is a success, I won't be able to use it.)

*Tyler shook his head in frustration and raised the crossbow, pulling the string back.*

Dawn: *She noticed Chrisma hovering over researchers, as they typed on their consoles.* "What are you doing?!"

Chrisma: *She quickly faced Dawn like a child.* "Whoup whoup!" *She groaned in excitement and waved her arms in the air, running out of the facility.*

Tyler: *He slightly squinted his eyes, aiming the crossbow with full concentration.* (Once more without distractions-)

*Tyler pulled the crossbow's trigger and lowered his arm, watching the arrow completely miss the target.*

Tyler: "Missed again? Even without the worry of pulling the arrow, I still can't do it." *He threw the crossbow into his RPG bag and walked off the platform, causing the scenery to revert back to normal.*

Dawn: *Tyler's footsteps caught her attention.* "Tyler?"

Tyler: "Oh, yes?" *He stopped and faced Dawn, hiding his failure.*

Dawn: "Don't you have something to say?"

Tyler: "Oh. Thank you very much for letting me use the simulator."

Dawn: *She nodded her head once, causing Tyler to walk out of the facility.* "So-" *She spoke to a nearby researcher, looking at several stones in her palm.* "Are your findings true to their word?"

Tyler: *He stood outside the facility and looked up in thought, walking across the corridor to the library.* (I've got a little more research to do.)

Chrisma: *She stood at the stairs, tugging on her robes in a curious manner.* (Was that Tyler?)

Researcher: *He stood next to Dawn and stared at the stones in her palm with a smile.* "Yes."

Dawn: *She moved the stones with her fingers, whispering in amazement.* "So, the exterior of the stones can actually alter the travel of a teleportation glyph in mid-transport?!"

Researcher: "All thanks to Ginger."

Dawn: "For research!" *She fist pumped the air above her, causing several researchers to do the same.*

----------

Nathan: (Despite wielding this sword, it takes a while to get used to a weapon. All swords are never made the same, so you need to adjust your grip, the amount of Neurons and the sharpness of the blade.. I trust my skills and I'll get to use this sword, but this shouldn't be a representation of how good I can be with it-) *He frowned and slid one foot back.* "Make your move!"

Lance: "You're on!" *He jumped forward, causing swirls of leaves to move around him.* "Harh!" *He slightly jumped up and swung the sword downwards.*

Nathan: *He tilted the sword and blocked Lance's strike with ease, causing him to glance at the sword with widening eyes in shock.* (There was no force in that swing-)

Lance: *He grunted and spun around.* "Hah!" *He struck upwards in an uppercut-like motion.*

Nathan: *He tilted the sword horizontally and blocked the strike with ease.* (There was no force again?)

Lance: (His sword didn't budge!?)

Nathan: *He flicked his wrist and Lance was pushed back, causing leaves to spiral around his feet.* (No.. He swung his whole body in that strike.. It's this sword!)

Lance: *He observed Nathan staring at the sword.* "Take a good look, that will be the last time you'll get to see your reflection before it's mine."

Nathan: "Unlikely." *He ran towards Lance and jumped into the air, raising the sword.* "This sword is, unreal-"

Lance: *He grabbed his sword with both hands and pointed upwards.* "You're open."

Nathan: *He dropped the sword on Lance's, causing red, blue, white and green sparks to scatter.* "This is strange?" *He slightly applied pressure on his sword, speaking in a curious manner.*

Lance: *He gritted his teeth, as he struggled to keep his sword up.* "W-Wat?!" *His eyes slightly squinted with each spark Nathan's sword caused.*

Nathan: "I'm not even trying."

Lance: "Grah-" *He slashed downwards to the side and sidestepped, firmly holding onto the sword.*

Nathan: *He looked shocked as his sword touched the ground.* "Huh?"

Lance: (He's wide open again-) *He sliced the sword across Nathan's face.*

Nathan: *He felt Lance's sword make contact with his nose.* "..."

Lance: (Got him-)

*A multi-coloured spark knocked Lance back, causing him to stumble and fall to the ground in shock.*

Nathan: *His arm suddenly appeared above his head.* "That was close." *He rubbed his nose with his left hand.*

Lance: "H-How-?"

Nathan: "I could already move my arm at blinding speeds, but considering this weapon is as light as a feather, I can swing it even faster with less stress on my muscles-"

Lance: "Tssk, wateva!" *He jumped up and stood in a defensive battle position.*

Nathan: *His body glowed a shade of blue.* "Azure burst, Double Slash." *He lunged forward and bent forward in front of Lance without moving his sword.*

Lance: (Somethin' doesn't feel right-) *He listened to two swift swings sway in the air, causing him to quickly jump back in confusion.*

Nathan: (Good intuition-)
Lance: *His sword suddenly flicked from right to left, as multi-coloured sparks scattered past his sides.* (He didn't swing his arms again!)

Nathan: (He unintentionally blocked that move.) *He stood straight with a relaxed expression and pointed the sword upwards.* "Ready when you are." *He grunted with a confident smirk.*

Lance: (Blasted shit nuggets, he can move the sword so fast I can't see it. I could always use my lightning and-)

Nathan: "You ready? You want my sword, don't you?" *He abruptly grunted.*

Lance: (Nah, I won't use Rostickal until he uses it. I don't know why, but I want to fight and see where my sword skills get me.) *He intensely stared at Nathan, frowning deep in thought.*

Nathan: "I gave the opportunity, you chose not to accept." *He lowered the sword to his side and ran towards Lance.*

Lance: *He stepped back, as he became alert.* "I don't need ya stupid offers." *He grunted and ran forward, raising the sword.*

Nathan: (What a predictable move swing.) *He glanced at Lance's sword then to his feet.* (His agility and awkward movements put me off guard and cause me to miss him.)

Lance: (It's actually hard not to use my Rostickal.)

Nathan: (If it's his awkward movements-, then I should-) *He leapt downwards, slashing the sword across Lance's ankles.*

Lance: "Tssk-" *He flashstepped, causing a pulse of leaves to swirl around where he stood.*

Nathan: *The sword screeched as it sliced through the air and he watched a line of leaves blow with the swing of his strike.* "Hmm."

*Nathan looked behind him and flashstepped, causing another gust of leaves to blow into the air.*

Lance: *He appeared behind where Nathan stood with the sword readied in both hands.* "Now you're-. Huh?"

Nathan: *He stealthily appeared behind Lance and raised the sword.* "Hah!" *He slashed across Lance's shoulder, causing a string of blood flick through the air.*

Lance: (Shit, my shoulder!-) *He gritted his teeth in pain, looking in the corner of his eye behind him.*

Nathan: *He lined the sword against his face and pointed it at Lance, preparing for a critical hit.* (This will end the match without inflicting him with a mortal wound-)

Lance: "No you don't-" *He twirled and spun around while ducking.*
Nathan: *He jabbed forward missing Lance.* "Tsst-"

Lance: *He sliced across Nathan's waist.* (Got him!-)

Nathan: "Hermph." *He jumped back and slashed at a tilted downwards angle, hitting Lance's sword away.*

Lance: *He gritted his teeth, noticing Nathan fluidly adjust the sword in his hand.* (Shit-)

Nathan: (It's amazing how another sword user is able to still stand before me-) *He slightly frowned in determination and jumped forward, slashing downwards towards Lance's head.*

Lance: *He swung the sword and blocked Nathan's attack, causing multicoloured sparks to scatter.* "Gah-" *His arms shook, as he tried to push Nathan's sword off his own.*

Nathan: *He stepped forward and pushed with his body, knocking Lance back.* "Hermph-"

Lance: "Tssk-" *He applied pressure on his toes and he suddenly stopped, causing leaves to blow back.* (The back of my shoulder, it stings-)

*Lance hid his exhaustion and stood up straight, facing Nathan with a serious frown.*

Nathan: "I won't lie, you're surprisingly good with your sword."

Lance: "Hey, you ain't bad yourself." *He unintentionally showed Nathan some respect.*

Nathan: "But, I'm getting ready to finish this fight."

Lance: "Oh yea?"

Nathan: "Yeah." *He appeared in front of Lance and slashed downwards.*

----------

*People sat around the square tables in the library, quietly mumbling to each other.*

Tyler: *He slouched over the table on his elbow, holding his head with one hand.* (No matter how many books I read about long-ranged weapons. Only bows, daggers and staffs are mentioned.)

*Tyler rubbed his temple in frustration, reading a thick book in one hand.*

Chrisma: *She peaked around the corner and stared at Tyler sitting at the table by himself.* (I wonder what he's doing?)

Tyler: *He shook his head, flipping through the pages.* "I don't know-"

Chrisma: *She tiptoed through the library and sat opposite to Tyler.* "..."

Tyler: *He noticed the table move, causing him to slightly tilt the book.* (Who was that-?)

Chrisma: *She smiled as she waited for Tyler to lower the book.* (Look, look, look-)

Tyler: (Chrisma?!) *He coughed and raised the book, pretending he didn't see her.*

----------

Lance: "So, how come ya so positive you'll win?" *He scraped swords with Nathan and jumped back.* "Well?" *He jumped forward and slashed across, downwards and to the side.*

Nathan: *He smirked and slightly swayed to each side, swiftly blocking Lance's continuous swings.* "I just know."

*Red and brown leaves slowly fell from the swaying tree branches in the wind.*

Lance: "Tssk-" *Multi-coloured sparks scattered around his sword.*

*Lance and Nathan stepped back and forth, as they sliced, stabbed, struck and jabbed their swords on an even level.*

----------

Tyler: *The table violently shook, causing his elbow to rock to each side.* (I can't believe it, why does she do this to me?) *He moaned with frustration and embarrassment.*

*Chrisma rolled across the table which drew the attention of the entire library.*

Woman: *She lifted a book in front of her face and leant to her side, discreetly glancing at Chrisma.* "What is she doing?"

Man: "I have no idea." *He mumbled to the woman next to him, staring at Chrisma.*

Tyler: *He lowered the book and sighed.* "Chrisma-"

Chrisma: "Oh? Hello." *She rolled on her stomach and stared at Tyler with a smile.* "How are you?"

Tyler: "Good..."

Chrisma: "Okay." *She continued to stare at him.*

Tyler: "I'm researching and I need to focus on my work."

Chrisma: "Okay." *She nodded her head.*

Tyler: "Thank you." *He raised the book and started to read.*

Chrisma: "..." *She heavily sighed, causing Tyler's eye to twitch.*

Tyler: *He closed the book, placing it on the table.* "What is it, Chrisma?"

Chrisma: "I, I just want to go paintbowling again."

Tyler: "Paintbowling?" *He had a flashback of Chrisma shooting him with paintballs.*

Chrisma: "It's fun-" *She groaned in excitement, nodding her head.*

Tyler: "It hurt."

Chrisma: "It's even more funner." *She groaned, pretending to shoot several of the people in the library.*

Tyler: "A shooter?!" *He gasped under his breath, staring at Chrisma's hand movements with widening eyes.*

Chrisma: *She stopped pretending to shoot the people, looking at Tyler in confusion.* "Tyler?"

Tyler: "You're a genius! I have to go-" *He quickly stood up and suddenly ran out of the library, adjusting the strap to the RPG bag.*

Chrisma: *She looked over her shoulder puzzled.* (What strange behaviour? I'm glad I don't act like that in front of anyone.)

----------

Nathan: (His sword techniques are on point, but his footwork-) *He dropped to the ground, slashing across Lance's legs.*

Lance: *He jumped over Nathan's slash and hopped backwards, keeping the sword pointed in front.* "..."

Nathan: *He instantly stood up and faced Lance, swaying the sword to his side.* (Great reaction-)

Lance: (That was close-)
Nathan: *He suddenly jumped forward, plunging the sword for Lance's chest.* "Hermph."

Lance: *He slashed across blocking Nathan's swing and ignored a wave of multi-coloured sparks which blew past him.* "..." *He gritted his teeth and leapt forward, violently slashing downwards.*

Nathan: *He blocked the strike with ease and smirked, as his body glowed a shade of blue.* "Hermph."

Lance: "Air Slash!"
Nathan: "Air Slash."

----------

*Tyler and the Blacksmith stood inside the garage-like facility, hovering over glowing red liquid.*

Blacksmith: "I'm amazed, and you say this was your first time, hermm?"

Tyler: *He stared at the liquid in a weary manner, nodding his head in response.* "Today was my first time doing something like this."

Blacksmith: "You must be naturally gifted at crafting."

Tyler: "Thank you."

Blacksmith: (Despite such abilities, he was able to create something I've never seen in my smithery lifetime...)

Tyler: "When can I do it?" *He spoke with anticipation, glancing at the Blacksmith.*

Blacksmith: "I suppose it's a little early for compliments, you've done the hardest part."

Tyler: "What's next?" *He spoke in respect, giving the Blacksmith all his attention.*

Blacksmith: *He stared at the red liquid, hiding his amazement.* "You've got to make the shape now."

Tyler: "Alright, I know it." *He spoke in determination, putting on yellow, metallic-like gloves.*

Blacksmith: *He watched Tyler dig his fingers into the sap-like liquid.* "Merge the shape and I can adjust the correct Rosterology symbols, to help induce the level of Neurons we pump into it."

Tyler: "Alright-" *He frowned in concentration.*

Blacksmith: "Excellent, hermm. Ensure not to be quick or too slow." *He appeared very interested in Tyler's work.*

Tyler: (I've never crafted anything to this level before, it's much harder than one would think-)

----------

*A strong wind howled in the forest, blowing the leaves in a circular motion around Lance and Nathan as they staggered back in opposite directions.*

Lance: *He awkwardly leant forward, glaring at Nathan.* "You knew the same move as me!"

Nathan: *He stumbled back and raised the sword in front of him.* "I had a feeling you would know some sword art Azure Bursts."

Lance: *He panted through his mouth, wiping his lips with the back of his hand.* "Well, here's another for ya."

Nathan: "Bring it."

Lance: *He tightly held the sword with one hand.* "Forty five, Streaming Sword." *Spirals of electricity sparked around his sword.*

Nathan: *He stepped back surprised, staring at the electricity.* (Elemental sword arts-) *He smirked in a slightly worried manner.*

Lance: "Harh-" *He skipped forward and hopped towards Nathan, raising the sword above his head.*

Nathan: "Such movements, trying to intimidate me?" *He quickly moved back, watching the electricity spark above Lance around the sword.*

Lance: "Yea." *He cockily stuck out his tongue, readying himself to slash Nathan.*

Nathan: "Hermph." *He took a deep breath and closed his eyes.* "Ougi."

----------

Blacksmith: *He hit Tyler's back in amazement.* "You have instantly gained my full respect, hermm."

Tyler: *He held something heavy with both arms.* "It's amazing, I created this?"

Blacksmith: "Gahahaha, enjoy the feeling while it lasts."

Tyler: "Why?"

Blacksmith: "When you've created many things, the feeling goes away sooner rather than later."

Tyler: "I've helped my peer-.. I've helped my friend create Genesis Stones, RPG bags and similar devices, Rosterology accessories and other stone-based creations, but this feeling is-"

Blacksmith: "Say nothing else, I understand, hermm." *He sounded jolly and proud of Tyler's work.*

Tyler: "Just wow." *He mumbled to himself, admiring the item in his hands.*

Blacksmith: *Someone rang a bell outside, catching his attention.* "I've got a customer."

Tyler: *He nodded his head, as the Blacksmith walked out.* "I better make sure it works well with the RPG bag-"

*The Blacksmith's deep voice could be heard from the other room, as he had a conversation with a woman.*

Tyler: "I've created poorly-made stones before, and the bag rejected the item, or at least, it wouldn't store in the Spacial Funnel."

*Tyler opened the flap to the RPG bag and inserted his creation, watching his hand slide in with ease.*

Tyler: *He gasped under his breath, smiling in relief.* "It works-"

Blacksmith: *He walked into the room, interrupting Tyler from his thought.* "Excuse me, your friend is here."

Tyler: "Excuse me?" *He faced the Blacksmith, instantly noticing Chrisma.* "Chris!- Wha!- How-?"

Chrisma: "I've come with good news."

Tyler: "Yes?" *He spoke on a sigh, adjusting the RPG bag around his shoulder.*

Chrisma: "I went to visit Madora-"

Tyler: (More like annoy her.)

Chrisma: "And she told me, she sensed Season heading this way."

Tyler: *He started to smile, squirming with growing excitement.* "Really?"

Chrisma: "Yes."

Tyler: "I'm going to wait outside for him."

Chrisma: *She smiled, tugging on her robes.* (Oh, bless him.) "Have fun."

Tyler: *He removed the yellow, metallic gloves and placed them on the table, readying to leave.* (Wait.. What will she do...?)

*Tyler sighed again, regretfully looking at Chrisma.*

Tyler: "Would you like to greet Season too?"

Chrisma: "Of course, bless you for offering! Whoup whoup."

Tyler: (Season, feels like I haven't seen you in ages! I can't wait to show you what I've accomplished all by myself.)

*Tyler smiled in thought and rubbed his RPG bag, looking at the Blacksmith.*

Tyler: "Thank you, sir, for your hospitality."

Blacksmith: *He nodded his head.* "I'd be happy to pay you if you decide to come back and make more of those things."

Tyler: *He awkwardly chuckled and smiled, walking past the Blacksmith.* "I'll take it into consideration."

Chrisma: "More of those things?"

Tyler: "Let's get going."

Chrisma: *She followed Tyler and paused, groaning in a curious manner.* "More of those things-?"

Tyler: "..."

*Chrisma and Tyler left the garage-like facility and squinted their eyes, smelling the air outside.*

Tyler: "Let's just focus on what we're doing now."

Chrisma: "Alright! To the entrance of the city, whoup whoup!" *She groaned in excitement, drawing unwanted attention from nearby people.*

----------

Nathan: (If I had cut any more, his protective Astragon barrier would break and he'd get inflicted with life-threatening damages.) *He rolled his shoulder and raised the sword, looking at his reflection in amazement.*

Lance: *He sat on his knees with the sword jabbed into the ground for support.* "You-" *He took quick breaths, leaning over the sword in exhaustion.*

Nathan: "You withstood my Ougi."

Lance: "Barely."

Nathan: "Well, I guess we'll see what other powers this sword has."

Lance: "W-Wat do you mean?"

Nathan: "I've been fighting on my raw skill, and the basic standards of the sword."

Lance: "Basic standards?"

Nathan: "You know, how the sword feels and its durability, etcetera."

Lance: *He grunted and stood up, placing all his weight on the sword.* "Well, bring it! It's my sword anyways!"

Nathan: *He ran his finger down the sword and admired its appearance, glancing at Lance.* "Your sword?"

Lance: "Pssht." *He purposely gave Nathan a feral look.*

Nathan: (He wants to fight even after seeing what I can do? Fine!-) "Here it is." *He ran up, raising the sword to his side.*

Lance: "No fancy move swings this time?"

Nathan: "Nothing fancy!-" *He yelled and slashed across Lance's neck.* (He better watch out! I'm pouring Neurons into my strikes now!)

Lance: *Multi-coloured sparks jumped off his sword, as he blocked the swing.* "Whoa-"

Nathan: *He quickly lunged back, slashing the sword across Lance's head.* "Hermph."

Lance: *He staggered back and quickly stepped to the side, managing to keep his balance.* "Ha, I didn't fall on my ass." *He grinned, sticking out his tongue.*

Nathan: "The sword is amazing." *He tilted his hand, admiring the sword's structure once again.*

Lance: "But I blocked-" *The sword in his hand cracked and snapped in half.* "Wat?!"

Nathan: *He looked down, cockily staring at the broken piece of sword.* "Look how clean that cut is."

Lance: *He stood in silence and fell onto his back, shaking his head in amazement.* "Man, holy flamin' icy shit buckets."

Nathan: "So, you've accepted defeat?"

Lance: "Well-"

*Crunching leaves caused Lance and Nathan to stop talking, drawing their attention in the same direction.*

Nathan: (It's a captain?) *He stared at a man in confusion.* (How long has he been here?)

?????: "I missed what happened, but I wouldn't accept defeat." *He mumbled in a deep voice and rocked his head, flicking hair out of his face.*

Nathan: (Is he just a wanderer, or-?)
Lance: *He stood up and brushed leaves off his pants.* "Who the shit kittens are you?!" *He snapped at the man and frowned, trying to hide his exhaustion.*

Nathan: "Introducing yourself without revealing your name is disrespectful." *He sounded annoyed, slightly facing the buff looking man.*

?????: "Respect? No one can comprehend true respect-"

Nathan: "I know all about respect, without mentioning your name is disrespectful already."

?????: "Names? The name's Brazza." *He smirked and folded his arms with a proud expression.*

----------

*A strong cold sea breeze brushed against Chrisma and Tyler's back, as they waited outside Silver Wind Island.*

Chrisma: "That was nice of your friend to give you the stone to activate the city's defence."

Tyler: (Dawn-) *He placed the item into his RPG bag and closed the flap, nodding his head with a smile.* "Yeah it was, wasn't it?"

Chrisma: "Also, what was that Blacksmith talking about?"

Tyler: "About?"

Chrisma: "He wanted to pay you for something?"

Tyler: (Still on about that-) "Oh, well-"

?????: "Well, I wouldn't know either, what does the Blacksmith want to pay you for?"

*A woman with silver hair flashstepped in front of Tyler and Chrisma, startling them both.*

Tyler: *He subconsciously stepped back behind Chrisma, watching the woman's silver hair with blue streaks sway in the wind.* "W-Who are you?"

Chrisma: (Flashstepping usually means the person is powerful.) *She froze on the spot, staring at the woman with an obvious intimidated-like expression on her face.*

?????: "Dakota, who are you?"

Chrisma: "I-I'm-"

Dakota: "And you two aren't strong, whose was that powerful Neuron signature I picked up then?" *She looked around in confusion, staring out into the distance.*

Tyler: "I'm not sure who you're talking about. I think you have us mistaken for someone else."

Dakota: "Unforgivable!"

Tyler: "A-Ah-?" *He squealed, slightly hunching behind Chrisma.*

Dakota: "Well, under orders of the Consultant, we must cause havoc."

Tyler: (The Consultant!)

Chrisma: "H-Havoc?"

Tyler: "We?"

Dakota: "To cause havoc, drama must fill the hearts of people. So, by killing you two, drama will happen, and that will cause havoc." *She smirked and took a step closer to Tyler and Chrisma.*

Tyler: (Oh no!) *He trembled in fear, using all his concentration to drag one foot back.*

Chrisma: "W-Well, you don't scare me! Whoup whoup!" *She jumped on the spot, trying to hide her fear.*

Tyler: "Chr-"

Chrisma: *She looked over her shoulder to Tyler, winking with confidence.* "I-It's fine-"

Dakota: "Fine? Kiss the rain, WATER STORM"

Chrisma: "Wha-?" *A blast of water slammed into her chest and knocked her back off the cliff.* "Argh!" *Her scream echoed as she fell towards the ocean.*

Tyler: *He couldn't look behind him, as his body froze with fear.* (Chrisma!)

Dakota: "What I used was Rostical, but I can't use Rostical. It was fake, did you like it?" *She giggled, tilting her head in an owl-like manner.*

Tyler: "..." *His arms shook with fear.*

Dakota: "No answer? Unforgivable!" *She took several intimidating steps towards Tyler.* "This is for my master!" *She smirked, pointing at Tyler.* "You're next!"

Chapter 9: Valhalla

*Ridley held himself tightly around the ribs in a poorly lit cave while bending forward in pain.*

Ridley: *He sighed in relief, causing him to relax his shoulders.* "The pain.. Has finally passed." *He relaxed his body and slowly stood up, taking a deep breath.*

*Rainbow coloured aura became active and lit up the cave, reacting to Ridley's relaxed-like state.*

Ridley: (The necessary precautions have been followed-) *He brushed his knees several times and faced the aura.* "Now that my body has become accustomed to the power of light, I can finally enter the holy light, without a worry of exposure to Radiaton poisoning."

*Rainbow coloured lights danced on the cave walls, cueing Ridley to face the aura and shuffle towards it.*

Ridley: (Sofia told me that a previous Sacred Knight, long ago, used a focused and condensed source of Radiatons that was lethal.. Understanding the dangers and taking that into consideration, unprepared exposure to this gateway is a chance I could not take.)

*Ridley reached forward and stepped through the rainbow coloured aura, causing a bright white light to blind him.*

Ridley: (This feeling, such excitement!) *He squinted his eyes, stepping onto a path.*

*Flying rock-like Scoldrants flew under the transparent path, causing Ridley to gasp in amazement.*

Ridley: *He shuffled forward in pure ecstasy, as he admired his surroundings.* "A mere path has caused me... Such delight."

----------

Locki: *He walked through an imperial-like castle, listening to the sounds of his footstep echo.* "Thy have an idea to help recall the Valkyrie's power-"

*Locki suddenly stopped and felt his arm in pain as a black glyph hidden under his armour caught his attention.*

Locki: "Hermm?" *He looked up and flashstepped, causing a strange movement-like sound to echo.*

----------

Celest: *She intensely stared into the pedestal, watching Alicia eat with Holland and PKMY around a picnic-like table.* (Thy can't tell what she's thinking, but, she's definitely thinking about something-)

*The distinctive sound of a flashstep echoed into the room, discreetly catching Celest's attention.*

Celest: *She continued to stare into the pedestal, as if she didn't care who it was.* "What can thy do for thou?"

Locki: *He looked surprised and started to walk towards Celest.* "Thy've picked up a disturbance on The Divine Path."

Celest: "Thy haven't sensed anything, nor have the sensors detected anything of unusual origin."

Locki: "That merely means no one from the land below has entered-"

Celest: "..." *She showed no signs of concern, watching Alicia awkwardly smile at PKMY and Holland.*

Locki: "Nobody has been given permission to go on The Divine Path, yet someone is on it as we speak!"

Celest: *She stepped back, causing the images on the water's surface to ripple away.* "Of course." *She lowered her head in respect and flashstepped.*

Locki: "Thank you." *He prepared to leave the room and a flicker of light shined on the edge of the pedestal, causing him to walk towards it.* (This has been causing me unnecessary grief for quite some time.)

*Locki walked up to the pedestal and hovered over it, listening to the chirping sounds of doves outside.*

Locki: "Show me Pepper." *He placed his hands around the pedestal and looked at his reflection.* ".. N-Nothing...? Thy don't see why it won't show her."

----------

Ridley: *He coughed and covered his excitement with his professional-like composure.* "Sofia-, no. I've planned this for some time-"

*Ridley tapped his foot on the aura path, forming a fist in determination.*

Ridley: "After long and detailed talks with Sofia, I must unlock the divine powers to their true potential-" *He stepped forward and Celest flashstepped in front of him.*

Celest: *Her eyes widened in shock as if she wasn't expecting anyone to be on the path.* (Locki was right!-)

Ridley: "..." *He stared at Celest with an emotionless face.*

Celest: "Thou, who are thou?"

Ridley: *He covered his mouth in shock.* "A celestial being!"

Celest: *She noticed his strange reaction to her presence, causing her to become alert.* "How do you possess Radiatons? I can sense them from you."

Ridley: "I highly desire to talk more, but I need to-"

Celest: *She appeared in the air directly in front of Ridley, violently kicking towards his face.* "Tcch!-"

Ridley: *He stared at Celest's foot with widening eyes, as things moved in slow motion around him.* (Her speed, I didn't even notice when she flashstepped. I'm only able to move in Tarlea or Teresa's speed for a few instances-) *His image appeared behind Celest.*

Celest: *She watched her foot come into contact with the side of Ridley's head.* "Got-" *His image vanished, causing her foot to side-sweep the air.*

Ridley: *He stared at Celest's back and stood up, as if he was getting ready to leave.* (She hasn't spotted me yet. I don't want to fight-) *He looked away, flashstepping off The Divine Path.*

Celest: *Her feet touched the path and she looked around shocked.* "Thy don't understand?" *She shook her head puzzled, glancing behind her up the path with a worried expression on her face.*

Ridley: *He flashstepped onto a small floating island, standing in ankle-high grass.* "I... I-" *He covered his mouth in amazement, as his eyes lay upon the beauty of Valhalla.*

*A floating mountain slightly warped in a weak Spacial Funnel and the sounds of a waterfall could be heard.*

Ridley: *A strong gust of wind snapped him out of his trance-like gaze.* "I... Have to do it, I must stop getting sidetracked." *He shook his head, quickly scanning the sky.* (Sofia said if nothing has changed, then the area I'm seeking should be-) *He flashstepped and appeared in front of a massive glass-like castle.*

--

Celest: *She flashstepped into a cathedral-like room, instantly noticing Locki near the pedestal.* "Locki-"

Locki: *Celest's fatigued-like breath instantly caught his attention.* "What is it?"

Celest: "A man, with Radiatons, thy did not recognise him, nor did he me."

Locki: *He closed his eyes.* (An intruder with Radiatons? The only plausible situation that would cause this to happen, is if one of our kind gave away their powers. But, only a few members of Valhalla have left-) *He quickly opened his eyes in shock.* "P-Pepper?" *He whispered in pain as the thought flashed in his head.*

Celest: "What about her?"

Locki: "..." *He remained silent.*

Celest: "Locki?"

Locki: (No, that's not possible!) *He grunted and flashstepped.*

Celest: *She looked puzzled due to Locki's unusual behaviour.* "..."

--

Ridley: *He looked down to the dirt ground, inspecting the edges of the island.* (I'm fascinated to know what keeps these pieces of rock in the air. I know they used a lot of power when they found out I planned to enter the city long ago, but, all these years have passed, and these islands are still in the air.)

*Ridley stared at the castle and ran towards a massive hole in the ice which acted as an entrance.*

Ridley: *He entered the castle with a slight wondrous-like smirk.* (Sofia specifically said not to flashstep in this castle.) *He reminded himself, as he slightly slid on the floor's surface.*

--

Locki: *He flashstepped on The Divine Path and looked around.* "No-" *He grunted to himself and flashstepped away with a disappearing image.*

--

Ridley: *His footsteps sounded like he was on glass, as he ran through the castle with an unfamiliar expression on his face.* (Such an odd feeling, on top of the already slur of fantastic emotions. I have not a clue where I am, but I know where to go.)

*Pillars of ice connected the floor to the ceiling, similar to Valhalla's royal-like castle.*

Ridley: *He looked to his side and stared at window-like holes in the wall, noticing clouds slowly drift by.* (Simple ecstatic-)

--

Locki: *He suddenly appeared in front of the glass-like castle, watching it sparkle in the sunlight.* (The Imperial Glacial Castle, what would a mysterious intruder do in there?) *He jumped forward, giving the illusion he glided across the ground.*

--

Ridley: *He ran on a slight curve and felt the wind, as the path he took spiralled along the outside of the castle.* "I couldn't imagine how they created this structure."

*Ridley whispered out loud and admired the castle's structure, keeping himself occupied.*

Ridley: "It simply amazes me."

Locki: *He noticed Ridley up ahead, as the sounds of his armour rattled together.* "Intruder! Halt!"

Ridley: (Already-?!) *He quickly glanced behind him without losing speed.* (Faster than I expected, much faster-)

Locki: "Thy say, halt!"

Ridley: (That man's voice, such a sense of power. No person has given me that sense of feeling before-)

Locki: (Thy've roamed these halls near the beginning of their lifetime, thy can easily move faster than anyone else.) *He ran with confidence, slowly closing the gap between them.*

Ridley: (If I make one wrong turn, this situation could become deadly-) *He quickly scanned the path ahead, noticing a doorway along the wall.* "Here."

*Ridley took a sharp turn, causing him to slide along the floor.*

Locki: (Radiatons or not, he's still not experienced enough to run on these floors.) *He slightly smirked, listening to a window-like wiping sound.*

Ridley: "Oh dear-" *He jumped on the wall and bent at the knees, swaying to the side.* (Focus-)

*Ridley concentrated and jumped off the wall, effectively increasing his running speed.*

Ridley: "Great! I used my unfortunate mishap and turned it into a good thing."

Locki: *He listened to Ridley's footsteps echo away with widening eyes.* (Such a manoeuvre! He's proven he is skilled, there's no need to engage in combat to understand this-)

*Locki took the sharp corner without losing speed or slipping, watching Ridley run up glass-like stairs.*

Ridley: (I hear his footsteps, it doesn't sound like he lost any speed either.)

Locki: "Halt! Thy offer mercy, allow time to talk."

Ridley: "I will be happy to, but I need a sense of comfort before doing so."

Locki: "Thy beg your pardon?!"

*The gap between them continued to slowly close as they skilfully ran up the glass-like stairs.*

Ridley: (Despite giving myself the right amount of time to get used to the Radiatons-) *He raised his arm in front of his face, noticing darkness evaporate out of his skin.* (-My shadow affinity is still weakened to light. Once my potential is unlocked, my weaknesses will become neutral, causing these fantastic beings to no longer be a threat.)

Locki: (How dare he not answer me!) "Where are thou going?!"

Ridley: "Could we please chat later?" *He smiled and jumped on the last step, running through an ordinary room completely made of ice.*

Locki: *He continued to run up the stairs, noticing Ridley no longer in his sight.* "There's nothing up there!"

Ridley: "So, you've moved the room?"

Locki: "Moved the room?" *He questioned himself in confusion and suddenly gasped in realisation.* "No!"

Ridley: *His smile grew wider at Locki's reaction.* "Oh, but yes." *He ran halfway across the massive room, focusing his attention to an unnoticeable door-sized entrance.*

Locki: (It can't be-) *He jumped over the last step, intensely staring at Ridley's back.*

Ridley: "The winnings of The Swarming Light Flight."

Locki: (This man is more of a threat than thy originally anticipated!-) "The divine art-" *He straightened his arm and aimed it at the middle of Ridley's back as he continued to run after him.*

Ridley: *He glanced behind him at Locki with a fading smile, avoiding eye contact.* (I sense a great power from him.)

Locki: "Bright as the holy sun, number eighty nine-" *He raised his other arm and formed a triangle with his fingers.* "CRIMSON BEAM"

Ridley: *He enthusiastically sprinted and leapt towards the room.* "I think I've almost achieved my first goal-"

Locki: "Harh!" *A fluoro red pulse splashed around his hands and a straight beam blasted towards Ridley at incredible speeds.*

Ridley: *He landed on his shoulder and frowned in pain, sliding into the room.* "Ouch-"

Locki: *The beam's blast caused him to stop due to its force.* (Am thy too late?!)

Ridley: "Crimson Beam? I've never witnessed that Remenistal before-" *He awkwardly crawled further into the room and ignored the ice as it shined red around him.*

Locki: *He stared ahead with shimmering red armour, blinded by the beam's fluorescent light.* (Did that stop him?!)

Ridley: *The beam touched the tip of his foot and instantly ignited into flames.* (Upon impact-?!)

*Before Ridley responded to the flames, the room's walls enclosed in ice, blocking and breaking the beam.*

Ridley: *He stared at the bright crimson flames which pulsed across the ice on the other side.* "The fire burns!"

Locki: (Blast the Astragons!) *He separated his hands which completely dispelled the beam.*

Ridley: *He grunted in pain and focused on his leg, turning his body into smoke.* (Quickly-) *He raised his leg, causing swirls of shadow to drift around it.* (Extinguish-)

*Ridley's body reverted back to normal without the fire, watching smoke puff around his boot.*

Locki: *He banged on the ice, gritting his teeth at Ridley's warped figure on the other side.* (Two scenarios will happen-)

*Locki formed a fist and punched the ice, causing the area to rumble in a glass, shattering-like manner.*

Locki: (He will either become much stronger and become a threat, or, he'll die at the mercy of The Voice of On. Thy will not be able to interrogate to him whichever occurs.)

*Locki gritted his teeth and formed another fist in a helpless manner.*

Ridley: (Saved by an automatic locking system. Sofia, my love, you were right on every account-) *He stood up and looked around, patiently waiting for something to happen.* "I'm ready?"

Locki: *He stopped attempting to get in the room and stepped back, sighing in a defeated manner.* (Then, thy must prepare for the worst.) *He turned around, flashstepping out of Ridley's sight.*

Ridley: *He looked in the corner of his eye to where Locki stood.* (The gentleman is gone. He may have given up earlier than I expected-)

*Ridley noticed his fingers twitch in excitement, causing him to close his eyes.*

Ridley: (I feel like a child. Needing to control my breathing to ease this excitement-) *He opened his eyes and noticed he stood in a different location.*

*Sunlight shined on one side of Ridley's face as he stood in an ordinary room with a massive window acting as a wall.*

Ridley: (Where am-?)

*A holy light shined through the glass, giving the room a slight yellow glow.*

Ridley: (My inner-self?)

*A man who resembled Millard appeared in front of Ridley.*

Millard: "We've been drawn out again?"

Ridley: "That form, Millardestel, you cannot be him."

Millard: "This is the form you see as a teacher or mentor."

Ridley: *He paused and twiddled his fingers, acting in a professional manner.* "Am I safe to call you the essence, The Voice of On?"

Millard: *He looked at Ridley in a serious manner.* (This man-) "How do you know?" *He raised his arms and the entire world around Ridley started to rumble.*

Ridley: *He looked shocked and quickly bowed to one knee, lowering his head in respect.* "I would like to tell you my plan, and you may wish to do whatever you like to me after."

Millard: "Excuse us?" *He appeared surprised and lowered his arms, causing the vibrating rumbles to stop.* "We are listening."

----------

Locki: *He flashstepped into a dark hall under the only ray of light which shined on the ground.* "The Wise!"

The Wise: *The sounds of flashsteps could be heard as members of The Wise filled the room.* "What is such urgency?"

Locki: "A man infiltrated Valhalla, and is using The On Resonance for an unknown agenda."

The Wise: "We've been monitoring the situation, and we shall take action."

Locki: "Why only take action now? It was thou yourselves who told me, the best way to prevent a problem is by nullifying its foundation-"

The Wise: "But also to assume innocence. The intruder may have good intentions-"

Locki: "Excuse this, but good intentions? Who would have good intentions if they broke into-"

The Wise: "Thou only lack wisdom, by assuming innocence it's possible to see."

Locki: "To see what?!"

The Wise: "He may have needed refuge, for example."

Locki: (A place to stay-?) *He stuttered as if he had nothing to say.* "..."

The Wise: "Despite what we say about assuming innocence, we were wrong."

Locki: *He gasped with widening eyes.* (The Wise admitted they were wrong?)

The Wise: "Retrieve your two fallen allies."

Locki: "Thou mean, release them from their sentences?"

The Wise: "We understand the rules are sacred, but Valhalla is far too important to let two powerful allies go to waste."

Locki: *He nodded his head in slight confusion.* "Of course."

The Wise: "Thou are dismissed."

Locki: "Right." *He turned around and flashstepped out of the room.*

The Wise: "Thy believe it's time we took action." *A woman with a powerful sounding voice spoke in the dark.*

The Wise: "Yes, only if it becomes any more ill ridden." *An old man's voice croaked, causing mutters of agreement to echo.*

The Wise: "That sounds reasonable." *Her powerful voice ended the conversation.*

----------

*Millard stared at Ridley who bowed on his knees in the empty room.*

Millard: "We have listened to your story and-" *He paused.*

Ridley: *He looked up to Millard and appeared emotionally vulnerable.* (I've told him my plans, my drive, I suppose if he declines the thought, then maybe I'm wrong-)

Millard: "We have accepted your request." *He turned around, slowly taking off the cone-shaped hat.*

Ridley: "I appreciate your consideration and kind gesture."

Millard: "Ensure no more innocent lives are lost, even at the cost of your dream."

Ridley: "I-I understand." *He lowered his head in respect and looked up to notice the room of ice.* "M-Magnificent."

*The ice moved on its own accord, revealing an exit to the room.*

Ridley: (My power-) *He lifted his arm and a ball of light grew above his palm, causing him to smile.*

*Glitter-like light dripped off the ceiling in a water-like manner.*

Ridley: "Hmph-harh-haha." *He laughed and spun around, causing a ring of light to spiral around him.* "Harh!-" *He spread his arms and the ring of light blasted around the room, causing the walls to crack.*

*The ice made glass-like screeches as it slowly restored itself.*

Ridley: *His stomach rumbled as if he was hungry.* "I feel so refreshed, but I can't stand here and drool over this power. I have to move on-" *He disappeared in a flash of light and shadow.*

----------

*Locki and Celest power-walked down a tight tall corridor.*

Celest: *She walked by Locki's side, listening to their footsteps echo.* "..."

*The roof was as high as a mountain and the area was lit by a green moonlight-like glow. Blue lightning which acted as cell-bars contained several people inside small rooms behind them.*

Locki: *His armour shimmered in the faint green light, as he silently walked down in thought.* (The Wise, releasing two of my comrades...)

Celest: "Are thou slightly excited?" *She kept her focus ahead, staring at a large cell at the end of the corridor.*

Locki: *He looked at the large cell, noticing massive blue streams of lightning static to each side.* "Why should thy?"

Celest: "Seeing your two allies."

Locki: "Celest, for someone who has had more time clocked on in life, thy am surprised by your childish questions."

Celest: "And as someone who has more time clocked on in life, thy am surprised thou haven't come to the realisation of how important allies and friends are in one's life." *She hissed and walked slightly faster than Locki.*

Locki: *He appeared surprised, watching Celest stop in front of the large cell.* "Are they conscious?"

Celest: "No, now awaken them."

Locki: "Could thou do it?"

Celest: "No, they are your friends."

Locki: "Okay." *He stepped next to Celest and paused, taking a deep breath.* "Lorilei, Cassidy, awaken."

----------

Ridley: *He stood in front of the ice castle and slowly inhaled, basking in a warm gust of wind which blew around him.* "The power of light has been awoken at its fullest."

*Ridley smiled and exhaled, watching a ray of light blast down from the sky.*

Ridley: (Is there someone in there?) *He noticed a silhouette of a man in the ray of light.*

Cassidy: *He stepped out of the fading ray of light, facing Ridley with a frown.* "Infiltrator, please explain yourself."

Ridley: "Despite me admiring your kind. I've already spoken to the entity whose opinion I only cared about-" *He had a flashback of talking to The Voice of On in Millard's form.* "I have nothing to say to you."

Cassidy: *He flapped his feathered wings and stepped forward in a battle-ready manner.* "Then thy will make thou talk."

Ridley: *He smiled and stepped back to the edge of the island, keeping eye contact with Cassidy.* "I see."

Cassidy: "Do not try anything stupid. Thou will fall to your demise."

Ridley: "I see." *He continued to smile as he relaxed his body and leaned over the edge.* "Why must you be so violent? This land, city, or area, is amazing."

Cassidy: *He reached behind his back and pulled forward, watching sparks scatter around his bamboo staff.* "Thou had many chances to talk, it seems action is required to take thou-"

Ridley: *He spread his arms with a widening smile and fell back off the island.* "Goodbye."

Cassidy: *His wings twitched in shock, as Ridley fell out of his sight.* "Thou fool, thou were needed alive!" *He angrily threw the staff to his side which disintegrated into white orbs and he sprinted off the island.*

Ridley: (To be a Sacred Knight, death is needed to lose all attachments to the living-)

Cassidy: *He glided downwards and noticed Ridley falling in the distance.* (That fool!) *He shouted in thought, holding a materialising pair of goggles in his hand.*

Ridley: (I can't do that, as I could never lose the will to leave behind our dream.) *He squinted his eyes and positioned himself in a torpedo-like manner, falling at incredible speeds towards the clouds.*

Cassidy: *He adjusted goggles around his eyes and flapped his wings, diving after Ridley.* (Thy can easily catch him-)

*Sparks of white light flashed around Ridley, catching Cassidy's attention.*

Cassidy: (What was that?) *He stared at Ridley, noticing a cloud of light swirl around him.*

Ridley: *He reached forward towards the clouds and prepared to dive through it.* "Come forth-" *A sudden burst of light caused him to slow down and glide, allowing him to swiftly fly above the clouds.*

Cassidy: "How did he-?"

Ridley: "Ha ha, haha." *He ignored the bright light behind him as he reached into the clouds, watching his arm move in it.* "Bwahahahahahaha!"

Cassidy: *He watched the light's brightness fade, causing him to instantly notice Ridley's radiant wings.* "Impossible!"

Ridley: "Perfect, absolutely perfect."

Cassidy: (How does he possess the divine wings?!) *He flapped his wings and followed Ridley, staring at him from a bird's eye view.*

Ridley: "These wings, simply amazing." *Darkness grew from his ears and covered his eyes, acting as a black visor.*

Cassidy: *He flew through a pocket of wind, causing him to unexpectedly fly downwards.* "Blast the spirits-" (Thy need to remember, thy've only just been awakened-)

Ridley: *He looked up over his shoulder, watching Cassidy awkwardly dive down after him.* "Personally, I thought I would've had more trouble, considering the difference in experience between us, in regards to flying-"

Celest: *She dived downwards and shattered one of Ridley's wings.* "..." *The momentum of her speed caused her to dive through the clouds.*

Ridley: *Glass-like shards of aura spiralled around him.* "W-W-?"

Locki: "CRIMSON BEAM" *He appeared in a pulse of light under Ridley.* "Harh!" *A fluoro red pulse splashed around his hands and he pushed forward, blasting a straight beam towards Ridley at incredible speeds.*

Ridley: *He spiralled downwards, causing his wing to bend in a fluid manner.* (I can't control the angle I tilt on-) *An eruption of flames exploded around him, blowing his hair and nearby clouds to one side.*

Cassidy: *He flew next to Locki and flapped his wings, standing on the air with a smile.* "Too easy-"

Ridley: "Tssk-" *He gritted his teeth and watched the flames turn to ash, as swirls of shadow surrounded him.*

Cassidy: "W-Was that Shadiatons-?"

Celest: *She flashstepped above Ridley as rings of cloud appeared around her.* "ARCADIC PULSAR LOTUS" *She punched downwards and a gust of white aura took form of a hand, smashing into Ridley.*

Ridley: "Ah-" *His face crunched under the fist-shaped aura, gritting his teeth in pain.*

Celest: "Harh!" *She swayed her arm, punching Ridley with the aura downwards.*

Ridley: "Oof-" *He blasted through the clouds, violently smashing into a field of flowers.*

*Locki, Celest and Cassidy flew towards the floating island.*

Ridley: *His body twitched in pain.* "Attacking me like that so suddenly, I didn't expect it."

*Locki, Celest and Cassidy stood in front of Ridley, watching him twitch on the ground.*

Celest: "How did thou enter Valhalla?"

Locki: "How did you obtain your powers?"

Cassidy: "..."

Ridley: *He coughed and leant up, wiping blood from his lips.* "That was powerful, another Remenistal I've never seen before."

*Ridley quickly glared at Celest and chuckled, slowly standing up in pain.*

Ridley: "So, where were we?" *He smiled and picked a flower out of his hair.*

Cassidy: "Answer their questions!"

Ridley: "How did I get here?" *He spread his arms and smiled.* "All this wouldn't have been possible without Sofia's help."

Locki: "Sofia...?" *He grunted in confusion and looked down in thought.*

Ridley: "And what about my powers?"

Locki: *He crossed his arms, placing them on his waist.* "Did you get them from Pepper?"

*Locki's question startled Celest and Cassidy, causing them to glance at him in shock.*

Ridley: "Pepper? Oh no, I merely sliced her head off."

Celest: *She gasped and focused her attention back to Ridley, covering her mouth in shock.* "..."

Locki: (Not possible without Sofia's help....?)

Cassidy: (No way! It's not possible!-)

Locki: *Sounds of metal scraping echoed, as wings of sparks splintered on his sides.* "If that is true, thy will slaughter thou myself!" *He pointed the black and red swords towards Ridley's face.*

Ridley: *He smirked.* "Aren't we meant to let go of our attachments-?"

Locki: *He skipped a step forward and flashstepped in front of Ridley.* "Pathetic scum." *He grunted, glaring into Ridley's eyes with anger.*

Ridley: "But-" *He wheezed out the word, causing him to look down in confusion.* "Oh.." *He noticed Locki's swords stabbed through his stomach.*

Locki: "That explains why Pepper's location cannot be found." *His eyes watered with sorrow and anger.* "What in right justice did thou have for killing her!?"

Ridley: *He looked up with an emotionless face, as the black visor disappeared in a puff of smoke.* "I wouldn't have been able to lay my eyes on this living wonder."

Locki: "Thou sicken me."

Celest: "L-Locki.. He's meant to stay alive so we can ask him where he retrieved those powers."

Cassidy: "Pepper... Gone like that? Thy won't believe that." *He mumbled in disbelief.*

Ridley: *He raised his hand.* "White ash, swirl with life and cause the opponent to halt, let the spirits fade, HOLYSHADE" *His eyes shined a beautiful golden colour and a stream of white lightning knocked Locki back across the ground.*

*The force caused strings of blood to splash off Locki's swords as they violently ripped out of Ridley's stomach.*

Locki: "Such force!-" *He tripped and tumbled across the ground, causing flowers and grass to rain on top of him.*

Celest: "Locki!" *She formed fists and readied to attack Ridley.*

Locki: *He stopped and frowned, slowly standing up.* "Kah-" *His hands started to shake, causing him to drop the swords.*

Ridley: *He held his stomach, as blood seeped through the corner of his mouth.* (I won't be able to heal, but I should acquire their rapid healing abilities.)

*Members of The Wise flashstepped in the air in front of Ridley, blowing the flowers in all directions.*

Lorilei: *She stepped off a fading glyph of purple light and stood next to Locki.* "Are you okay?" *She spoke with a high tone, proudly spreading her wings.*

The Wise: "Your demise is absolute, repent for your sins and thou-"

Ridley: *He covered his mouth with watering eyes.* "Oh my-" *His words muffled through his hands.*

The Wise: "What is it?"

Ridley: "I could never harm any of you. Please, I would be eternally happy if you accepted me into your group."

Locki: "Are thou joking?" *He coughed, puffing out his chest with growing emotion.*

Celest: "Thou are no Diareamer. Stop dreaming!"

Cassidy: "No way we'll have thou be with us."

The Wise: "We will not fall under such obvious tricks."

Ridley: *He shook his head.* "No, I've dreamt of carrying out justice with the power of light-"

Celest: "What thou said about Pepper-"

Locki: "Ougi, CELESTRIAL LANCER" *He opened his palm towards Ridley and five red sword-like rods appeared.*

Ridley: (Celestrial Lancer?!)

*The swords burnt the grass and flowers around them, catching Ridley's attention with a dropping jaw.*

Ridley: "Amazing-"

Locki: "Harh!" *He formed a fist, causing the swords to blast towards Ridley.*

Ridley: *The swords of fire moved around him in slow motion.* "Forceful sounds, radiate the ground, as deep as abyss, DARK STYX" *He smirked, watching darkness cover the swords.*

Locki: *He stared at the swords, puffing through his nose in anger.* "What is this?!"

Ridley: "Merely under my control-" *He clicked his fingers and the swords shot off towards Celest.*

Celest: *She gasped as two swords struck into her stomach.* "Ka-?!"

Lorilei: "MYSTIC SHIELD" *She snapped her fingers and a white shield blocked the three other swords.*

*The Wise watched the swords flare into flames before extinguishing into the air.*

Cassidy: "Locki!" *He grunted, watching Celest fall to the ground.*

Locki: *He ignored his own wounds and ran over to her.* "Quick healing shot, HEALING IMPLOSION" *Light glowed in her wounds, cueing it to start rapidly healing.*

Celest: *She pushed Locki away, frowning at Ridley.* "Pepper! Zougoi." *She screamed with an echoing voice, catching everyone's attention.*

Ridley: "Zougoi?"

Lorilei: "Something stronger than a Hi-Ougi, the strongest level an Azure Burst can go."

Ridley: "Don't be ridiculous-"

Celest: "Number seven-hundred and eighty two, SYNTHUS-CELESTIC SUMMONCE AVALON" *Her entire body shined blue and warped, suddenly moving like liquid.*

The Wise: "Besides me, who else was aware of Celest's power?"

Cassidy: "Not me-" *He looked up, speaking with a sense of respect.*

Locki: *He watched Celest float into the air with widening eyes.* "A Zougoi?"

Cassidy: (Not even Locki knew?)

The Wise: "This is not a normal thing, but merely her ability. There is no such thing as an Azure Burst stronger than a Hi-Ougi."

Ridley: (Exactly my thoughts.)

Cassidy: (I was about to say, a Zougoi, never heard of it.) *He watched Celest's body swirl into a ball of pink liquid.*

Lorilei: "Her ability is a power similar to Rostic Dancers."

Ridley: *He wiped the blood from his mouth, pointing at the ball of liquid.* "NIGHTSHA-"

Celest: "Begone." *She transformed into a twenty-foot woman covered in pink armour, causing the party to gasp.*

Ridley: *He paused with widening eyes, unsure what to do.* (My Nightshade can't damage something of that size-)

Celest: *She watched a materialising javelin longer than the island appear in her hand.* "Repent!" *She swayed the javelin across Ridley at blinding speeds.*

Ridley: *He flashstepped into the air and gasped, watching the island crack.* (She's strong-)

*Half of the island exploded and fell down, losing its float-like ability.*

Ridley: (Impossible?!)

*Cassidy, Lorilei and Locki rocked back and forth, as the island violently rumbled underneath them.*

Ridley: *He looked down and observed the damage Celest caused.* (The sheer power, that divine woman sliced the island with a stroke of her spear!)

*Radiant wings erupted from Ridley's back, causing him to hover in the air.*

Ridley: "A-Are you the Valkyrie? How could you obtain the holy power?"

The Wise: "What are thou talking about?"

Ridley: "The item only the Valkyrie can use."

Locki: "What are thou talking about?"

Ridley: "The item. How does it actually work? The prototypes, the dark orbs, they didn't work. What is the missing variable?"

Locki: *He chuckled with an anger-filled smile.* "It works like The Weapons of Memories, there's no way a filthy mortal could ever hope to replicate-"

Celest: "Thy'll show thou what The Astral Plains looks like!"

Ridley: *His eyes widened as Celest swayed the javelin again.* "Tssk-"

Cassidy: *He listened to a sonic-sounding shockwave screech through the air past Ridley.* (Fast!-)

Celest: *She sighed with exhaustion and dropped to one knee, causing her armour to rattle and the island to rumble.* (.. That's enough-)

*A bright pink light swirled around Celest, catching Lorilei's attention.*

Lorilei: (It didn't last long, was it because she was wounded beforehand?)

Cassidy: *He watched the pink light fade, staring at Celest in the air.* (She's normal size again?)

Locki: *He glanced at Celest, watching her float to the ground.* (She's reverted back to normal.)

Ridley: *He patted himself and stared at Celest in confusion.* "That was pointless, releasing such power for only a swing that didn't even damage the opponent-"

Celest: *She looked down to her feet, shaking her head with growing sadness.* "No, thou're wrong."

Ridley: "Wrong-?" *A ring of blood splashed around his wrist and his hand suddenly sliced off.* "Grarh!-" *He watched his hand fall through the sky with widening eyes.* (Argh-)

Celest: "Thy sliced the vein that carries the most amount of Neurons to the brain, thou don't have much longer."

The Wise: "Enough, we shall banish thou!"

Locki: "Thou're not even worthy to rot in Valhalla!"

Ridley: *He held his wrist in pain, watching blood drip towards the island.* "Please, I beg of you. Reconsider having me by your side-"

Locki: "Thy can never forgive thou!" *Images of Pepper flashed through his mind.*

*The Wise, Locki, Lorilei, Cassidy and Celest stood in a line and looked up, facing Ridley.*

The Wise: "Don't hold back!"

Locki: "Humph." *He grunted in confidence, readying himself with a frown.*
Celest: "..."
Cassidy: (Thy won't!-)
Lorilei: "Oh my, this is upsetting." *The air around her warped as she began to gather power.*

Ridley: "Please-"

The Wise, Locki, Lorilei, Cassidy and Celest: "Begone! INTER SEAL"

Ridley: "But, I want to join you-" *Symbols appeared all over his body and he suddenly materialised on The Divine Path.* "The Divine-?"

*An unknown force pushed Ridley off his feet and knocked him through the rainbow-coloured aura.*

-

*The aura flashed as Ridley smashed through it, momentarily lighting up the rocky walls.*

Ridley: "Oof-" *His grunts echoed in the cave as he violently hit the ground.*

*Ridley rolled across the cave's floor, watching dirt swirl around him.*

Ridley: *He lay on the ground motionless, taking quick short breaths.* (That was, upsetting.)

*Ridley wiped a tear from his eye and looked at his handless arm, watching blood drip on to the dirt.*

Ridley: "It hurts, everything hurts." *He stood up and faced the rainbow coloured aura.*

*The aura responded to Ridley's presence and it suddenly vanished, causing the area to appear darker than normal.*

Ridley: *He brushed off dirt around his wrist and noticed a new hand slowly growing from his wound.* "I guess.. I will continue on with our plan.. The mission was successful after all."

*The cave was quiet and cold as Ridley stood on the spot motionless.*

Ridley: *He sniffed and stepped forward, twiddling his newly formed fingers.* "Hmm?" *He stopped and looked into the distance.* (That power, it's familiar?)

----------

*Sofia kicked Teresa onto the ground, glancing at the entrance to Concern's Gate.*

Teresa: *Her body was limp due to exhaustion.* "This is bad, I can sense him-"

Sofia: *She stepped forward and grabbed Teresa by the scruff, smirking in an evil-like manner.* "I don't care who you sense." *She tightened her grip around Teresa's robes and flashstepped.*

Teresa: *The area became dark as it blurred past her at blinding speeds.* "Tcch-"

Sofia: *She flashstepped into a clearing lit by torches, deep inside the cave.* "Ridley!" *She shouted with an echoing voice, watching light flicker around the torches.*

Ridley: *His image appeared from the shadows.* "Sofia?" *He paused in confusion, as if he wasn't expecting to see her.*

Sofia: "Ridley." *She faced Ridley with a smile, holding Teresa hidden behind her.*

Ridley: "I've got good news, the mission was a success and everything you told me was true."

Sofia: *She lowered her head in respect and smiled.* "I have more good news to tell you. I have something you might want to see."

Ridley: *He felt his newly healed fingers and smiled, rubbing his hands together.* (This is splendid! Even though I'm slightly fatigued from what happened in Valhalla, my hand and stomach have already healed themselves.)

Sofia: "Heetee-" *She chuckled and threw Teresa onto the dirt, staring at her with her cold silver eyes.*

Ridley: "What have you got there?" *He stepped closer to Sofia, walking out of the shadows.*

Teresa: "T-Tcch-" *She groaned in pain and coughed, causing dirt to blow away.*

Ridley: "Teresa Seraph?" *He looked down to Teresa in shock, suddenly smiling in a curious manner.* "How?"

Sofia: "I caught her and her friend heading straight here."

Ridley: (Teresa might have sensed the commotion due to my banishment? She was always good at reading things she shouldn't-)

Sofia: "So, I killed her friend and took Teresa down." *She looked down to the ground and chuckled in disrespect, focusing her attention back to Ridley.* "She was strong, but I had no trouble."

Ridley: *He glanced at Sofia then to Teresa.* (I forgot, Sofia's as strong as me now, even Teresa should no longer be a problem.)

Sofia: "My love?"

Ridley: "This is excellent news." *His gratitude caused Sofia to smile.*

Teresa: "I w-will defeat you." *She spoke with exhaustion and struggled to move her body.*

Ridley: *He smirked in a serious manner and started to walk towards the weakened Teresa.* "We shall see about that?" *Shadows puffed around his hand and solidified into a black sword.*

Sofia: (Amazing how he summons shadow to form his weapon.) *She whispered in thought, looking at the black sword with growing interest.*

Ridley: "I will end your life now. You've interfered with my plan for the last time."

Teresa: "Pl.. Plan?"

Ridley: (Ultimate peace.) *He frowned, glancing at his hand.*

Sofia: "Ridley?" *She seemed surprised at his sudden reaction.*

Ridley: "I'm not very happy."

Sofia: "W-Why?" *She seemed upset for Ridley.*

Ridley: "I was finally able to confront the holy beings-" *He sighed and looked at his sword.* "Those very beings I dreamt over for so long.."

*Ridley had flashbacks of Locki and Celest attacking him, causing him to shake his head in frustration.*

Ridley: "I'm just, not happy at this present point in time." *He continued to walk towards Teresa.*

Sofia: *She paused, flicking her ponytail over her shoulder.* "Would you like me to leave?"

Ridley: "Oh, not at all." *He stopped and hovered over Teresa.*

Teresa: *She looked up, gritting her teeth.* "Tcch-"

Ridley: *He held the sword with both hands and slowly raised it over Teresa's head.* "This is it." *He spoke with an emotionless tone, glaring at her with cold eyes.*

----------

*PKMY, Holland and Alicia sat around the picnic table, leaning back with content faces.*

Holland: "That hit the spot." *He burped with satisfaction, staring at the empty dishes on the table.*

PKMY: "Pig."

Holland: "Oh, what?"

Alicia: "It was enjoyable." *She smiled and agreed with Holland.*

Holland: "See?"

PKMY: "Wateva." *She looked away and hid her smirk, watching the vibrant pink sakura trees sway in the wind.*

Holland: *He opened and closed his hands.* "I think your healing abilities are amazing, Alicia."

Alicia: "O-Oh?" *She focused her attention on Holland.*

PKMY: "I'm still a little jealous myself."

Alicia: "R-Really?" *She gasped in disbelief.*

PKMY: "..." *She folded her arms, nodding her head.* "Don't be so surprised-"

Holland: "Yeah, if I had the power to heal, I'd heal everyone."

PKMY: "Wat about the bad people?"

Holland: "Even the bad people."

Alicia: *She lowered her head, causing her hair to cover her face.* (Healing? Curing sickness... But, I love him..)

PKMY: "Go ahead and heal the bad people, stupid ogre."

Holland: *He glanced at PKMY, smirking in a competitive manner.* "Oh, I will! Healing Rings-"

PKMY: *She watched Holland spiral his hands around her face.* "Oh, really-?"

Alicia: "M-May I ask a question?"

*PKMY and Holland focused their attention to Alicia, looking at her with curious faces.*

Alicia: "Umm-" *She kept her head lowered, causing PKMY to impatiently lean forward.*

PKMY: "Yea?"
Holland: "Shoot?" *He burped with his mouth closed, placing his hands on this back of his head.*

Alicia: "If you could heal as many people."

Holland: "But I can't-?"

PKMY: "It's a hypothetical question, Holly!"

Holland: "Jeez, sorry Docta Jingles."

PKMY: *She punched the table in anger, implying she didn't want to play games.* "Continue, princess."

Alicia: "Y-Yep." *She bit her bottom lip, looking down to her lap.* "What would prevent you from using the power to heal people?"

Holland: "Well, nothing." *He yawned, not knowing the importance of her question.*

PKMY: "I'd agree with Holly-"

Alicia: *She stood up, taking a deep breath in understanding.* "Okay, that's all I wanted to know."

PKMY: "Eh?"

Alicia: "Th-Thank you." *She stepped around the table and started to walk away.*

PKMY: "Wait, where are you going?"

Holland: "That was a little abrupt?"

PKMY: (Something is wrong.)

Alicia: (Maybe I'm being selfish-..) *She whimpered in thought, forming fists.* (I'll go back to Valhalla and-)

Holland: "Alicia?" *He stood up and shouted in a deep voice.*

Alicia: "I-I'm leaving."

PKMY: "No, you can't-" *She bent back and flipped over the seat, staring at Alicia's back.* "There are powerful Scoldrants that reside around these lands-"

Alicia: "I have to go."

Holland: "Alicia, listen to her! I can't even hold a connection with these Scoldrants-"

Alicia: "I don't understand what you mean." *She continued to walk with a saddened face.*

Holland: *He quickly followed Alicia with PKMY.* "I can't Soul Link with these Scoldrants, they're vicious due to the yellow-eyed illness-"

Alicia: *She paused and shook her head, standing at the entrance to the village.* "M-My mind is made up."

PKMY: "I don't think that try hard will like you leaving."

Alicia: "Tell Lance, I love him."

*Holland and PKMY stopped behind Alicia, staring at her back in confusion.*

Holland: "Well, you need to see Arcadia or Ginger to get out of the village, neither of us knows how to open the gates."

Alicia: *She ignored Holland as she spoke with an emotionless tone.* "Goodbye."

PKMY: *She leant to one side annoyed, folding her arms.* "Wat you mean, goodbye?"

Alicia: "It wasn't good enough-" (My decision, it's not good enough-)

PKMY: "Was it the food?" *She looked up to Holland slightly annoyed.* "Princess, stop seeking attention and-"

Alicia: "..." *A purple glyph drew itself under her feet and she disappeared in a flash of purple light.*

Holland: *A gust of wind blew in his face, watching the light fade with the glyph.* "T-Tele-portation?" *He looked down to PKMY with a surprised expression.*

PKMY: "Wha...?" *She gasped in shock, unsure what just happened.*

Holland: "Did Alicia have one of Season's Rosterology items?"

PKMY: "No.. Go get Arcadia or Ginger, she might be outside!"

Holland: "Right." *He turned around and jogged towards the wooden house.*

----------

*A bright purple glow filled the narrow caves of Concern's Gate with light.*

Alicia: *She stepped off the fading glyph and stared at the cave's wall.* "My presence, hear my voice-" *White light sparked along the walls and a rainbow coloured aura shined brightly.*

*The coloured aura danced on the walls, filling the air with warmth.*

Alicia: *She intensely stared at the aura with an emotionless face.* "..."

*Alicia ignored faint echoing sounds deep inside the cave which unknowingly belonged to Ridley, Sofia and Teresa.*

Alicia: "My new home welcomes me." *She sounded upset and walked through the aura, causing it to warp around her.*

--

*Moonlight shined on The Divine Path, causing the aura to radiate a blue-like glow.*

Alicia: "I will accept Celest's-"

*Someone stepped through the rainbow coloured aura before it faded away, causing Alicia to turn around.*

?????: "Hello." *She smiled at Alicia, brushing her green hair out of her face.*

Alicia: *She looked shocked and faced the woman.* "W-Who are you?"

?????: "I'm known as Pickles."

Alicia: "I'm Alicia, pleased to meet you." *She hid her emotions, staring at Pickles' shiny green hair.*

Pickles: "Out of the selection we had, I wanted to see a healer. I wonder how well you can fight."

Alicia: *She stepped back in an intimidated manner.* "Please, I don't want to fight."

Pickles: "Sorry, neither of us have a choice." *She tensed her body, readying herself to fight.*

----------

*PKMY and Holland walked across a garden and paused as Ginger ran out onto a veranda, instantly catching their attention.*

Ginger: "Ey, there is a captain-classed hostile approaching this village! Please respond!"

Holland: "Alicia might be out there!"

PKMY: *She focused her attention on the entrance.* "Never met whoever it is, but their intention is to cause us harm."

Holland: *He tilted his head up and folded his arms.* "They'd be a fool to fight us."

PKMY: "Heh, not just looks, are ya, Holly?" *She grunted and looked up at him with a smile.*

Arcadia: *She wheeled out of the house and noticed Ginger standing on the veranda staring out towards PKMY and Holland.* "Ginger-"

Ginger: *She frowned at PKMY and Holland's carefree attitude.* "What is this trivial banter? Has Arcadia's training failed you?!"

Arcadia: (This was much sooner than expected.) *She touched her forehead, trying to hide her overwhelming emotion.* (All of this is happening one after another. Thy cannot keep up-)

Holland: "I'll fight if this captain wants to hurt people, but is this our problem?"

PKMY: *She cracked her neck to each side and sniffed with a smirk, punching her fists together.* "Hell yeah."

Holland: "Hahaha, very good." *He shouted with his deep voice and scratched his shoulder, before readying himself.*

Arcadia: "Ginger, please, the entrance."

Ginger: "Yeoshh." *She swayed her arm towards the entrance, causing the logs to move on their own accord.*

Arcadia: *She glanced at PKMY and Holland, watching them intensely stare at the wooden fortress.* "Go, your exit is now accessible!"

*The logs moved further apart from each other, revealing the entrance to the village.*

Arcadia: (Be safe.)

PKMY: "OK." *She grunted and sprinted forward with her arms swaying behind her.*
Holland: "Thanks." *He grunted at Arcadia and chased PKMY outside the village.*

*A pillar of rock covered the entrance behind Holland, causing him to look over his shoulder.*

Holland: "Looks like we're by ourselves for now-"

PKMY: "It doesn't look like she's here." *She sounded upset, brushing her hands through her hair in confusion.*

Holland: "Alicia?!" *He shouted out with concern.*

PKMY: "Are you thick? I just said she's not here."

Holland: "Where could she have gone?"

PKMY: "Hmm.. What was that light? It couldn't have been a teleportation glyph, what else could it be?" *She grunted at herself, frowning in thought.*

Holland: "Do you think it was this captain?"

?????: "Wasn't me, s-sorry." *He jumped out from the ground as clumps of dirt erupted around him.*

Holland: *He instantly stared at the man, gasping in thought.* (He was in the ground?!)

?????: "Maybe it was a teleportation glyph?" *He smirked in a cocky manner, trying to get a reaction.*

Holland: "Hrmm-" *He puffed out his chest and stood in a confronting manner.*

PKMY: "Who are you?!" *She formed a fist and looked annoyed, staring at the slender man with pale skin.*

?????: "Your death bringer, Isaac."

PKMY: "Eh? Death bringer?"

Isaac: "N-Not that I think it really matters, since I'm going to kill the b-both of you."

Holland: *He smirked, exhaling through one side of his mouth.* "If you think so."
PKMY: "Eh?" *She snapped out of her worried-like train of thought, glancing at Isaac.*

Isaac: "W-Who to kill first?"

PKMY: "You want me to smash you in the face?" *She smirked evil-like, taking a step forward.*

Isaac: "I-If you can, definitely." *He nudged forward and two house-sized boulders blasted up from the ground, hovering in the air.*

PKMY: *She looked up with widening eyes.* "Ground affinity-"

Isaac: *He moved his fingers and small shards of rock shot up from the ground, ringing around PKMY and Holland's ankles.* "Now you c-can't move-"

PKMY: "Heh." *She smirked, as if she wasn't worried.*

Holland: *He tried to lift his legs, causing the shards to dig into his skin.* (No good-)

Isaac: "Grrr-" *He threw his arms forward and the boulders slammed into Holland and PKMY, knocking them across the ground.* "I want to be the first person in m-my party to kill their target." *He grunted with anger and excitement.*

Chapter 10: Number One

*Lance, Nathan and Brazza intensely stared at each other, ignoring a wave of red leaves which blew past them.*

Nathan: (Looks like he has axes tied to his back, meaning, he's a powerful but slow fighter.) "What do you want from us?"

Brazza: "The Consultant finds you both a threat." *He mumbled in a deep voice, speaking in a lazy-like manner.*

Lance: "Wat did ya say?"

Brazza: "That was such disrespect." *He glared at Lance in anger, reaching behind his shoulder.*

Lance: "Have a cry-"

Brazza: *He grabbed the handle to one of the axes and flicked it, causing it to disconnect from the armour.* "Then I will end you first-"

Nathan: *He stepped in front of Lance, raising the sword with both hands.* "As the wielder of The Sword of Memories, I will defeat you."

Brazza: "Hmph." *He smirked and tightened his fist, causing the blades of the axe to extend.*

Lance: *He looked to the ground and observed the sword Nathan sliced in half.* (That sword sliced my sword like it was butter, that Brendza guy shouldn't underestimate it.)

Nathan: "A normal person wouldn't tell, but when you said Consultant, you had no respect in your words."

Brazza: "Because I don't respect him-"

Lance: "Wut?"
Nathan: (He doesn't respect his superior?)

Lance: *He raised an eyebrow, looking at Brazza in confusion.* "You don't respect the boss-?"

Brazza: "Someone who gets someone to do their own dirty work-"

Nathan: *He grunted as if he instantly understood.* "Is pathetic."

Brazza: *He nodded his head, raising the axe to his side.* "At least you won't be boring."

Lance: "You're doin' this outta boredom?"

Brazza: "Yes." *He mumbled in a deep tone.*

Nathan: "I give you the option to leave now, before we fight."

Brazza: "Huh?" *He looked slightly shocked.*

Nathan: "What is it?"

Brazza: "I was going to say the exact same thing."

Nathan: *He smirked.* "Let's go?"

Brazza: "Right." *His image disappeared, leaving an eruption of swirling leaves.*

Nathan: (What-?!) *He looked to each side, hiding his shocked reaction.*

Lance: "Huh?!" *He spun around like a child, trying to find Brazza.*

Brazza: *He flashstepped above Nathan with the axe raised above his head.* "..."

Lance: *The sounds of wind drew his attention above Nathan.* "Shit-" (Brenda's fast.) *He stepped back several feet.*

Nathan: "Hah!" *He looked up, slashing the sword above him.*

Brazza: *He descended into Nathan's strike and kicked, causing the armour around his feet to spark.* "Hmph." *He spiralled in the air and landed, swaying the axe towards Nathan's face.*

Nathan: "Tsst-" *He sidestepped avoiding Brazza's swing which made a hollow-like noise.*

Lance: *He noticed Nathan's hair move in the wind.* (That axe was really close to his head-)

Nathan: "Air Slash." *He sliced the sword across, screeching a visible air slash towards Brazza.*

Brazza: *He flashstepped several feet back and pointed the axe in front.* "Bring it."

Nathan: (Does he honestly expect to block-?)

*The sounds of distorted metallic-like scratches echoed from Brazza's axe.*

Nathan: *He mumbled with widening eyes.* (He!-)
Brazza: *He watched the air slash wave on the end of his axe, blowing his hair and nearby leaves back.* (Strong-)

Lance: "Shit nuggets-"

Brazza: "..." *He twirled the axe, breaking the air slash into a swirl of wind.*

Nathan: (He blocked the air slash with the top of the axe!) *He watched scattering winds cut past Brazza's armour and face, leaving behind faint scratches.*

Brazza: *He smirked and flicked his wrist, spiralling the axe in a casual manner.* "Hm-"

Nathan: (This isn't good-)
Brazza: *He flashstepped to the side of Nathan.* "Ph-" *He leant forward and held the axe sidewards, readying to slice Nathan in two.*

Nathan: "Double Slash."

Brazza: (An Azure Burst-) *He stepped back and sliced across, causing multi-coloured sparks to scatter off his axe.*

Nathan: *He frowned with focus, readjusting his hand on the sword.* "Air Sl-"

Brazza: "Argh-" *He spun his body once and threw the axe downwards, slamming it on top of Nathan's sword forcing it into the ground.*

Lance: *The ground vibrated, causing a pulse of leaves to blow away from Brazza.* (Crap!-)

Nathan: *He swayed forward, due to the unexpected power hit.* (The force behind that strike! I can't get him off it!)

Brazza: *He looked down and smirked, watching Nathan's sword dig into the dirt.* "Aren't you strong enough to lift my axe?"

Nathan: "Ergh-" *He struggled to lift his sword off the ground, as Brazza applied more weight on the axe.*

Brazza: "This is a little boring, liven it up and use Rostical." *He moaned in a bored manner.*

Nathan: *He gritted his teeth and frowned.* "I won't ever use Rostical." *He bent at the knees and adjusted his hands on the sword.*

Brazza: *He stared at Nathan's hands.* "Attempting to lift-?"

Nathan: (I've seen many Azure Bursts, some seem like simple commands to forcefully move Neurons throughout the body-..) *His body glowed a shade of blue.* "Flying Upper."

Lance: *He watched Nathan swing the sword in an uppercut-like motion.* "Nice-"

Brazza: "..." *His axe was knocked back by a line of multi-coloured sparks.*

Lance: *He fidgeted as if he wanted to join in the fight.* "..." *A red leaf spiralled down from the branches above and landed in his hair.*

Nathan: *Sounds deepened and the leaves moved in slow motion around him.* (He seems skilled, but there's something that gets me worried about this opponent.)

Brazza: *He glanced at Nathan's hands and fingers around the sword, causing his eyes to widen.* (A sudden Neuron build up!-) *He kicked back and slid on the leaves away from Nathan.*

Nathan: *He looked confused, as he concentrated on Brazza's movement.* (Why did he retreat? I don't use Rostical, how was it possible he knew I was going to use a critical hit?)

Brazza: (He's skilled-) "But skill alone won't help you out."

Nathan: (Oh really?) "I've had no troubles since, and I won't now."

Lance: *He stared at Brazza who gave Nathan all his attention.* "Ya know, I'm your opponent too?!"

Brazza: "Shush you, you don't even have a weapon."

Lance: "Well-"

Brazza: *He rudely sighed over Lance and flicked the axe in his hand.* "So, guy with the sword, make your move." *He smirked with confidence.*

Nathan: (This foe, even with this sword, I feel like I'm on edge-) "What are you? Black Brigade? New division of captains-?"

Brazza: "How about I show you? But first, show me what you got?"

Nathan: (What did that mean? He'll show me..) "No."

Brazza: *He sighed, lowering his head.* "'Kay then."

Nathan: *He frowned.* "'Kay what?!"

Brazza: "What I can do..." *He lowered his axe to the side and crossed his arm.* "This-" *He opened his palm and a scattered stream of red lightning sparked away from his hand.*

Lance: *He looked surprised, as Brazza's lightning made a loud static sound.* (Lightning!)

Nathan: *He stared at the lightning in a fixated manner.* (Damn, what a fool!-) *He gritted his teeth.* (Of course, someone as strong as him would possess Rostical.)

Brazza: "So, I've got this in the bag-" *He glanced at the fading lightning, blinking in confidence.*

Nathan: *He stared at Brazza with an emotionless face.* (What am I going to do? Lightning and water, I hate those elements!)

Brazza: *He closed his eyes and breathed deeply through his nose.* (When I'm finished with these guys, I'll go find the next strongest opponent-)

Nathan: (I won't-) *He grunted in anger, causing a vein to pop up under the skin on his neck.*

Brazza: (The Consultant gave us several targets to annihilate.) *He looked up, listening to the leaves rustle in the wind.*

Nathan: *He tightened his grip on the sword's handle.* (I won't be defeated by him, just because he uses Rostical!) "I won't!"

Lance: "Oi, give me the sword-" *He whispered with a grunt, trying to grab Nathan's attention.*

Nathan: (I'm not used to this sword to avoid lightning, one touch and it'll be the end of me..)

Brazza: (I can't find Pickles, but the quality of Neurons I'm feeling everywhere... It's actually hard to tell who'll need my help-)

Nathan: (I have to use speed! There's no other choice!) *Leaves swirled around him, catching Lance's attention.* "Hah!"

Lance: *He stared at Nathan and looked shocked as his image disappeared.* (Where did he go-?)

Brazza: *He sighed, opened his eyes in a casual manner.* "Settle down-" *He noticed Nathan's sword slicing across his face.* (What?! I didn't feel his flashst!-)

Nathan: "Skill can topple anything!"
Brazza: *He slammed the axe upwards with widening eyes.* "Hmph."

Nathan: *Multi-coloured sparks splintered in his face, as the force of Brazza's swing knocked him back.* "Tsst."

Lance: "Close.."

Nathan: *He slid back and stabbed the sword into the ground, causing him to instantly stop.* "H-How?"

Brazza: "Ha ha, you could do better than that." *He smirked, raising the axe in front of his face.*

Nathan: *He tilted his wrist, inspecting the sword in confusion.* "How could your axe block this weapon?"

Brazza: "True potential is far superior than your skill-"

*The axe made an unusual sound, causing Brazza to tilt it in curiosity.*

Brazza: "Huh-?" *The axe shattered and snapped in half, crumbling on the ground next to his feet.*

Lance: *His eyes widened in shock.* "Whoa."

Nathan: *He smiled and quickly became serious.* (At least the weapon finally lives up to its title.)

Brazza: *He grunted and carelessly dropped the handle to the ground.* "Fair enough."

Nathan: (This is where it'll get hard. Since I shattered his weapon, he's got no choice but to use Rostical.)

Brazza: (I don't know how he was able to do that-) *He clicked his fingers and red lightning sparked around his arms, forming into a blade.*

Lance: (Whoa!)
Nathan: (The lightning? It's a weapon?!)

Brazza: *He slightly smirked, pointing the axe made of lightning at Nathan.* "Now you're gone."

Nathan: "I'm gone?" *He spoke in a low tone and raised the sword.*

Brazza: *He flashstepped directly in front of Nathan, jabbing his axe towards Nathan's face.* "..."

Nathan: *He quickly leant back and swayed underneath Brazza's strike, causing red shadows to flash on his face.* "...-"

Brazza: *He raised his other arm and sliced another axe downwards, watching it cut into Nathan's neck.* "...-"

Nathan: *His image appeared beside Brazza, slicing the sword for his neck.* "Hah!-"

Brazza: *He flashstepped behind Nathan, jabbing both axes in a scissor-like manner.* "...-"
Nathan: (His position-) *He noticed the red light appear on the leaves on the ground, cueing him to quickly flashstep behind Brazza.*

Brazza: *He sliced Nathan's fading image with a growing, frustrated frown.* "Hmph-" *He flashstepped to Nathan's side.*

Nathan: *He flashstepped face to face with Brazza, slicing in front, causing blood to drip around his feet.* "Hah!"

Brazza: (He hit me!-) *He flashstepped several feet back.*

Nathan: *He flashstepped in front of Brazza, slicing the sword back and forth twice.* "Double Slash-"

Brazza: *He flicked his axe's up, blocking both strikes.* (This guy-)

Lance: *He watched flashes of bright red light, followed by multi-coloured sparks appear around Nathan and Brazza.* (Holy shit!-)

Brazza: *He sliced downwards, cutting Nathan near his knee.* "Hmph-"

Nathan: "Tsst-" *He grunted and leant to the side his leg was cut.*

Brazza: (There!-) *He swayed his other arm, slicing the axe towards Nathan's chest.*

Nathan: (Such a simple attack!-) *He raised the sword, blocking Brazza's attack.*

*Multi-coloured sparks splintered in between Nathan and Brazza's faces as their weapons came to a stop.*

Nathan: (This lightning feels like metal! Is this what her bow feels like-?!)

Brazza: *He smirked.* (Does he forget this is lightning?) *The red lightning suddenly thickened, brightening its blood-red colour.*

Nathan: (I can feel the heat on my face!-)

Brazza: "Now die!" *He watched the axe suddenly lose its shape, stringing up and around Nathan's arms.*

Nathan: "Argh!" *He swayed his sword to the side and the force pulsed him and the lightning apart.*

Brazza: *He stumbled back and looked surprised, noticing a strange aura disappear from Nathan's sword.* (How? The Rasticsplash should've-)

Nathan: (If I hadn't used Hard Blade and utilised the aura from the Azure Burst to block the contact with his lightning, that would've been a game changer-)

Brazza: (Why didn't my lightning strike through his body?) *He thought to himself in curiosity as the lightning formed back into their axe-shaped weapons.*

Nathan: (I'm really nervous.. Should I activate a Self-inflicting Glyph?) *He took a deep breath and slowly exhaled.* "Ougi."

----------

Tyler: *He shivered in fear, watching the silver-haired woman stare at him.* "W-What-?" *He gulped and awkwardly inhaled, trying to say something.* "H-Have I done something to offend you?"

Dakota: "You help the enemy-, my master, you upset him." *She jumped forward and formed a fist.* "Unforgivable!"

Tyler: "No-" *He quickly ran to the side and avoided eye contact.*

Dakota: "Are you joking?" *She stopped, watching him run a circle around her.*

Tyler: "N-No, I'm not joking."

Dakota: *She kicked under her and jumped into the air, causing wet dirt to pulse away.* "For my master, accept this!" *She waved her arms and strings of materialising water whipped through the air towards Tyler.*

Tyler: *He continued to run in a large circle, staring at the ground in front of him.* (I hope she grows bored and leaves, one of the ways to tire a bully is to ignore them-)

*A string of water splashed in front of Tyler, causing him to cautiously slow down.*

Tyler: "Water-?" *The string of water suddenly exploded into several eruptions of high pressured spurts.*

Dakota: (Got him.) *She landed on the ground with a smirk.*

Tyler: *His legs flapped above him, as the water's pressure pushed him off his feet.* "Argh-" *He spiralled down and coughed out water, violently hitting the ground.*

Dakota: "Harh!" *She swayed her arms and swirls of materialising water spiralled into the air.*

Tyler: *His hair dripped of water.* "Karf-" *He coughed and leant up, awkwardly holding onto his RPG bag.*

Dakota: *She swirled the water with her hands above Tyler.* (This is incredibly easy, master you'd be impressed.)

Tyler: *He gasped and looked above him, staring at the water with widening eyes.* (She can control the water like nothing I've ever seen before.)

Dakota: (Now my beautiful element, detonate-) *She lowered her arms, watching white foamy water explode around Tyler.*

Tyler: *He closed his eyes, as water violently erupted from all sides.* (This is so scary!)

*The noises of Dakota's water overpowered the sounds of the crashing waves in the background.*

Dakota: "Now-" *She spread her arms, causing the water to wave away from Tyler.*

Tyler: *He lay on the ground drenched in water and coughed, slowly raising his head.* "Arh-"

Dakota: *She walked towards Tyler, causing the water on the ground to separate away from her feet.* "Now, before I do my master the favour, I need you to tell me if I missed anyone?"

Tyler: "Anyone?"

Dakota: "To kill?"

Tyler: "N-No-"

Dakota: *She bent down, grabbing Tyler by the hair.* "Unforgivable! Tell me!"

Tyler: "I-I don't know what you're talking about-?"

Dakota: "Ha!" *She violently let go and stepped back.*

Tyler: "W-What are you going to do?"

Dakota: "..." *She clicked her fingers and a blast of water erupted under Tyler, pushing him into the air.* "I'll get the information I need-" *She spun around and kicked Tyler on the side, blasting him through the water.*

Tyler: "Pain-" *He wheezed under his breath and tumbled back, rolling across the ground.*

Dakota: *She watched water slightly rain on Tyler, due to the force of her kick.* "Get up!"

Tyler: *He stopped rolling and whimpered, lying still on the damp ground.* "P-Please, l-leave me alone-"

Dakota: "I'm not going to leave you until I complete the mission my master has assigned me."

Tyler: *He stood up and hunched forward, holding his side in pain.* "I w-won't fight."

Dakota: *She noticed her reflection in a nearby puddle, causing her to touch her head.* "You won't fight?" *She grabbed a pinch of hair and purposely flicked a blue streak to the middle of her face.*

Tyler: "N-No, so please leave-"

Dakota: "Then, I'll make it quick for you." *She yelled in anger and sprinted towards Tyler.*

Tyler: *He wheezed in fear, as Dakota charge directly towards him.* "P-Please!-"

Dakota: *She formed fists, ignoring the blue streak of hair which flicked in her face.* "..."

Tyler: *He shuffled one foot back and forth as he tried to move out of the way.* (Move, move!)

Dakota: *She raised her fist and jumped into striking distance.* "The end."

Tyler: "No-" *He stepped backwards and fell over, accidentally avoiding her punch.*

Dakota: *She looked downwards in shock, as she fell forward.* "Huh?"

Tyler: *Dakota's foot tripped on his shoulder, causing her to tumble across the ground.* (Ouch-)

Dakota: "Unforgivable!"

Tyler: *He stood up and turned around, nervously frowning in thought.* (I have to be strong!) *He reached into the RPG bag and stopped, tightly holding onto something.*

Dakota: *She rolled and tumbled onto her feet, sliding on all fours in an animal-like manner.* (How dare he!)

Tyler: (I've never been good at sports, please work-) *He pulled his hand out of the bag and leant back, throwing a red crystal at Dakota's back.*

Dakota: *She stood up and stamped on the damp dirt, slowly turning around to face Tyler.* "I've got strong offence-" *A red crystal moved in slow motion in front of Dakota's face.*

Tyler: *He took deep breaths, closely observing the crystal with anticipation.* "..."

Dakota: *The crystal glowed and a blast of flames suddenly exploded, pushing her off her feet.* "Rostical-!?"

Tyler: *He nervously threw his hand into the bag and spun around, throwing a green crystal under Dakota.* "..."

Dakota: *She frowned at Tyler, waiting for her to land.* "You will-"

*The crystal glowed and a hurricane-like pulse, blasted Dakota to the side, knocking her off the cliff.*

Tyler: *He gasped in surprise and stared out across the cliff, listening to the howling wind fade.* "..."

Dakota: "No!" *Her screams echoed, as she plummeted towards the ocean.*

Tyler: *He took deep breaths, trying to relax.* (Did that actually do it?)

*Tyler nervously rubbed his side and cautiously walked towards the cliff.*

Tyler: *He stopped and nervously took a deep breath, readying himself to look over the cliff.* (I won't know if I don't check-)

*A tidal wave suddenly erupted up from the ocean and rose high above the cliff, causing Tyler to squeal in shock.*

Tyler: *He stepped back with a dropping jaw, as the area turned dark due to the wave's shadow.* "W-What?!"

Dakota: "I'm the strongest water manipulator." *She rode the wave and stared at Tyler from in the air.* "How dare you hurt me to this extent!-" *She rubbed a slight burn mark on her cheek in anger.*

Tyler: (This is bad.)

Dakota: "I will kill you!"

Tyler: *He shivered on the spot, as his clothing dripped with water.* (How..? What can I do to get myself out of this-?)

Dakota: "Answer me!" *She screamed, causing Tyler to jump in fright.*

----------

Ridley: *He smirked, watching Teresa twitch on the ground.* "What are your thoughts on the matter?"

Teresa: "M-Matter?" *She mumbled with exhaustion, struggling to even move her body.*

Sofia: "..." *She listened to the sounds of dripping water echo deep in the cave, as she silently stared at Ridley.*

Ridley: "Someone raised and known as a prodigy, only to be killed by my hands, and without even having to battle?" *He smirked in amazement, keeping his black sword pointed at Teresa's head.*

Teresa: "Make it quick." *She grunted in defeat.*

Ridley: "So be it." *He jabbed the sword into the ground which made an echoing sound of fruit being stabbed.*

Sofia: "Nicely done, Ridley! Heetee."

Ridley: *He sighed and pulled the sword out of Teresa's head.* "Thank you, Sofia. I feel much bet-" *A slash mark appeared across his cheek, causing him to stop.*

Sofia: "Ridley?"

Ridley: "What... Is this?" *He started to bleed down his neck.*

Sofia: "What's that?"

Ridley: *He felt his cheek in shock, staring at the blood on his finger with widening eyes.* "I don't-"

Teresa: *Her image appeared behind Ridley.* "You scum!" *She emotionally screamed, listening to it echo several times.*

Ridley: *He gasped and quickly turned around in shock.* "What?! How was that possible?!"

Teresa: "You essentially killed my mother! I can not forgive you!"

Ridley: "H-How? I stabbed you-"

Teresa: "Never forgive you!" *She screamed and frowned with quivering lips.*

Ridley: "Emotions? This is an unusual sight-" *He coughed out blood and looked down, noticing a sword through his chest.*

Teresa: *She stood straight and faced Ridley with pride.* "She stabbed you in the chest, you do not have long now."

Ridley: *He looked over his shoulder and noticed Sofia holding the sword behind him.* "S-Sofia?"

Sofia: "Heetee." *She grinned evil-like as her image warped.*

Ridley: *His eyes widened in shock, staring at Sofia's distorted image.* "Who are you?"

Sofia: *She lowered her head, watching her entire body warp into a completely different figure.* "Don't you remember me?"

Ridley: *He coughed out blood, watching it drip around his feet.* "No?"

?????: *She looked up and smirked, staring Ridley in the eyes.* "I'm Jewel."

Ridley: *He grunted, hiding his surprise.* (That experimental number one!)

Teresa: *She reached behind her back and pulled her arm forward.* "Now-" *Sparks lit up the cave.* "Let's end this, Jewel!"

Jewel: "Sure thing."

Ridley: (No-)

Teresa: *She swayed to the side, readying to throw the Pentarang.* "Air-"

Ridley: "MANIPULATE, DARK STATE" *A wave of darkness pushed Jewel back and caused Teresa to step back in suspense.*

Teresa: *She stood out of attacking range, watching the darkness dissipate in the air.* (I will not allow the Rasticsplash of his Rostical to reach me again.)

Ridley: "D-Do you think you two could defeat me?"

Jewel: *She awkwardly stepped back and waved her hand to the side, causing the darkness to puff away.* "With that wound, it's likely."

Teresa: "This place, Jewel?"

Jewel: *She smiled and lowered her head.* "Illusions..." *Her voice echoed, as the area blurred and started to swirl.*

Ridley: *He looked around surprised, as bright light blinded him.* "What's happening?"

Teresa: (Do not be reckless, Jewel! Illusion-based Rostical are one of the most consuming abilities to use.)

Ridley: *He grunted and squinted his eyes, staring at bright golden sand.* "Maserio?"

Jewel: *She looked up, smiling in accomplishment.* "Heetee."

Ridley: *He gently placed a hand on his chest, frowning in thought.* (This stab wound will cause me a hassle. I've only just healed my hand and stomach-)

Teresa: *She spread her legs for a sturdier stance, causing sand to swirl around her feet.* "Pentarang!" *She shouted, raising it to the side above her.*

Jewel: *She warped behind Teresa and watched from a safe distance.* (Don't give him any mercy, Teresa!)

Ridley: "Hey, hey, let's talk this over, what do you say?" *He awkwardly smirked at Teresa, shaking his hands as if he didn't want to fight.*

Teresa: "Humph." *She leant to one side, throwing the Pentarang directly at Ridley.*

Ridley: "..." *He frowned and disappeared in a puff of smoke, causing the Pentarang to miss.*

Teresa: "Tcch-"

Ridley: *He appeared behind Teresa and stared at her back.* "I'm quite shocked at this tactical strategy." *He spun around and pointed at Jewel.* (Darkened volt, burn a cross and cause the opponent to halt, let your existence fade-) "NIGHTSHADE"

Jewel: *She firmly held a sword with a pink handle, looking at Ridley in an unexpected-like manner.* "Night Shade?"

Ridley: "Why, yes." *He smiled and pushed forward, blasting a stream of black lightning through Jewel's head.*

Teresa: "Jewel!" *She screamed and gritted her teeth, watching the black stream of lightning puff into smoke.*

Jewel: "Karh-" *She coughed out blood and fell backwards, reaching for the sky.*

Ridley: *He smirked, watching Jewel fall to the ground in slow motion.* "And you, Terra-"

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She quickly glanced behind her, watching the Pentarang slowly spiral back towards her.*

Ridley: *He suddenly flashstepped in front of Teresa, pointing directly in her face.* "NIGHTSHADE"

Teresa: *She leant back in shock, quickly raising her arm.* "Typhoon's-"

Ridley: *Black lightning suddenly sparked through Teresa's head, causing her arms to flop to her sides like jelly.* "You can't beat me-" *He heard a giggle, causing him to instantly look over his shoulder at Jewel.*

Jewel: *Her arms and legs streamed like sand and her giggle echoed in different tones.* "You're in our world now."

Ridley: *He watched a gust of wind blow Jewel's sand-like body into the environment.* "What-?!"

Teresa: "Indeed-" *Her body puffed into sand and swirled into nothing.*

Ridley: *He slightly frowned in frustration.* (This is bad, how did I get this deep in her illusion?)

*A warped image of Teresa sliced across Ridley's face.*

Teresa: *She firmly held the Pentarang, watching it touch his face.* "Humph."

Ridley: *He quickly twirled to the side barely avoiding Teresa's slash.* (Blast-) *He gritted his teeth, noticing strands of his hair waft past him.*

Jewel: *A gust of sand revealed her image behind Ridley.* "..." *She squinted her eyes in determination, stealthily raising her sword.*

Ridley: *He noticed another cut-like stream of blood run down the side of his face from his ear.* (This cut, I should be thankful I was able to react to Teresa's amazing speed-)

Jewel: *She pulled her arm back and lunged forward, violently jabbing the sword towards Ridley's back.* "Harh!"

Ridley: "..." *He looked in the corner of his eye in a serious manner and flashstepped, causing Jewel to take large awkward steps forward.*

Jewel: "Missed!" *She hissed to herself and looked around.*

Ridley: *He flashstepped far in the distance and squinted his eyes, as the bright sunlight shined off the sand.* (This is dangerous-)

Teresa: *Her image appeared in front of Ridley.* "Harh!" *She sliced the Pentarang across Ridley's neck.*

Ridley: *His eyes widened and he bent back.* "Kerh-"

Teresa: *She watched blood string from Ridley's neck with a smile.* "..."

Jewel: *She warped in a swirl of sand by Ridley's side, jabbing the sword into his arm.* "..."

Ridley: "Argh!" *He grunted, watching Jewel violently rip the sword out of his arm and prepared another attack.*

Teresa: *She raised the Pentarang, as another image of her appeared behind Ridley.* (Look at what this man has made me become!) *She gave Ridley a cold stare, as her body glowed a shade of blue.*

Ridley: (They're all in close range! Quick!-) "With my holy powers unlock the white lights, silently gather and make what is right, MANIPULATE, SERENE STATE"

*A circular wave of light erupted from the ground around Ridley and spiralled into the air.*

Jewel: *She stepped back, looking up in shock.* "Light?"
Teresa: *She stared at her copy with a shocked face.* "Another affinity?!"

Ridley: "Harh!" *He swayed downwards and the wave of light suddenly crashed on top of Jewel and the two copies of Teresa.*

*Ridley took a deep breath, watching a pulse of sand erupt into the air.*

Ridley: "This certainly wasn't expected-" *He held his arm in pain as blood ran in between his fingers.*

Teresa: "Not expected? We have merely started-" *Five copies of Teresa confronted Ridley.*

Ridley: (Five?!) *He shook his head in a dizzy-like manner and frowned with growing fatigue.* "NIGHTSH-"

*Two metallic streams soared through the air behind Ridley, suddenly piercing into his shoulder-blade.*

Ridley: (What is this?) *He looked down and noticed the metallic boomerang-shaped weapon piercing out of his chest.*

Teresa: *She stood on one knee and held the Pentarang in the distance, staring at Ridley's back.* (I missed his heart! I struck too high.) *She frowned and ripped the Pentarang out.*

Ridley: *He coughed out blood, frowning in thought.* (Damn that Stylus of Memories!-)

Jewel: "Heetee." *Her laugh eerily echoed and she materialised as Gabriel.*

Ridley: "Th-That voice?" *He spoke under his breath, looking at Jewel with double vision.*

Jewel: *Gabriel stepped forward, facing Ridley.* "Ridz, what are you doing?"

Ridley: *He lay his eyes on Gabriel, causing him to instantly ignore his surroundings and pain.* "G-Gabby?" *He whispered to himself in disbelief.*

Jewel: "Yes, Ridz. Why don't we stop this nonsense?"

Ridley: "If, you want to?" *He spoke softly and unsure.*

Jewel: "That would be great." *Gabriel smiled and stood in front of Ridley.*

*A red glyph shined under Teresa in the distance as she focused her attention on Ridley with squinted eyes.*

Ridley: "H-How is this possible?"

Jewel: "I've been watching you-"

Teresa: *She raised one arm in front, causing her hair and surrounding sand to blowback.* "VOLCANIC ERUPTION"

Ridley: *The ground burst open, causing him to look down in shock.* "Gabby?"

Jewel: *Her image materialised into herself.* "Nope, heetee." *She bent back and flashstepped, causing sand to swirl away.*

Ridley: "J-Jewel." *He frowned in anger.* "How dare-" *An eruption of fire-like lava exploded underneath him, causing him to yell in pain.*

Jewel: *She appeared next to Teresa, swaying her arms downwards.* "How are things?"

Teresa: *She concentrated on her eyesight.* "Things are going well, another five critical hits and he shall be finished."

Jewel: (Five more?) *She stared at the bright lava, smirking in an evil-like, confident manner.*

Ridley: *He spread his arms, causing the fire-like lava to extinguish around him.* "How dare you take that appearance!"

Jewel: (Wow, he broke free?) *Hot gusts of wind blew past her face.* (Hot!-)

Teresa: *She covered her face in shock as her hair rapidly flapped over her shoulders.* (Although it was not boosted with its incantation, he blocked the flames with only his physical being.)

Ridley: "You!" *Smoke rose from noticeable charcoal marks on his clothing.*

Teresa: *She glanced at Ridley in confusion, looking at Jewel in a worried manner.* "What form did you take? I have never seen him display such negative emotion-"

Ridley: "How do you know about Gabriel?!" *He frowned in rage, slowly facing Jewel and Teresa.*

Jewel: "Oh? I just read your memories and took the form you-"

Ridley: *His image suddenly appeared above Jewel.* "Now I'm mad!"

Jewel: "Wha-?" *She looked up with widening eyes.*

Teresa: (His speed increased by several levels!-)

Ridley: "Bloody Eruption." *He punched down and blood-like water crashed on top of Jewel.*

Jewel: "Eek-" *Her voice bubbled, due to the water.*

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She looked at the water with gritted teeth.*

Ridley: *He looked at Teresa with anger filled eyes.* "..."

Teresa: *She looked up to Ridley and frowned.* "Azure-"

Ridley: "Crimson Shade." *Black and red lightning fell from the sky and hit Teresa, as it channelled through her body and hit the ground beneath her.*

Teresa: "T-Tcch-" *Sand pulsed around her before she fell to the ground.*

Ridley: *He landed heavily on one knee in exhaustion, watching Teresa land face-first into the sand.* "Done."

*The red water drained into the sand and revealed Jewel on the ground motionless.*

Ridley: *He glanced at Jewel before holding his arm.* "The force of my attack and the correct timing of water caused her to drown."

*White orbs started to evaporate off Teresa and Jewel, causing Ridley to smirk.*

Ridley: "You put up a good fight, prodigy." *He turned around and started to walk away.*

----------

*Alicia and Pickles silently faced each other, listening to the wind howl outside The Divine Path.*

Pickles: (The wind... It sounds so lonely.) *She sighed and tapped her feet on the aura-like path.* (Sturdy, like solid ground-)

Alicia: *She stared at Pickles with an emotionless face.* "I'm actually not a fighter, you see, I was born in-"

Pickles: "Please, could we simply fight? I don't want to know anything about you or your history."

Alicia: "Why?"

Pickles: "Because it will sadden me furthermore."

Alicia: "..."

Pickles: "We will fight."

Alicia: (I have no time for this.) "ICICLE EDGE"

Pickles: *She appeared surprised and looked up to the forming ice spears.* "Out of all the information we were given, you were the one not to like violence."

*The ice hardened into sharp appearing spears and suddenly shot down towards Pickles at incredible speeds.*

Pickles: (Fast!-) *She swayed her arms above her head and curved ice pillars rose above her.*

Alicia: "Information?"

*The spears smashed against Pickles' ice, causing them to shatter.*

Alicia: *She noticed the curved ice pillars, cueing her to lower her arms.* "You, control ice?"

Pickles: "Yes." *She bent down on all fours and closed her eyes.*

Alicia: "I-I don't like violence-"

Pickles: (Glacia's Edge.)

Alicia: *A wave of ice shards erupted from the ground towards her.* "Huh?!" *She gasped in shock.*

Pickles: (I'm slightly shocked about her attitude, maybe our information was wrong?) *She kept her eyes closed, envisioning Alicia's body and the wave of ice rumbling towards her.*

Alicia: *Her body glowed a shade of blue.* "Icicle Stroke." *She karate chopped upwards, causing a curved slash-like stream of ice to materialise in front of her.*

*Alicia jabbed her arm forward, slicing the ice towards Pickles in a defensive manner.*

Alicia: "..." *She watched the ice collide and smash against Pickles' upcoming ice, causing multiple glass-like shattering sounds to echo.*

Pickles: *She slowly opened her eyes filled with concentration.* "I see." *She stood up and held two dagger-shaped ice shards in each hand.*

Alicia: *She stared at Pickles with an emotionless face, ignoring shards of ice which shattered past her face.* "I need to do something important."

Pickles: "Is your life more important?"

Alicia: *She looked down and silently stared at the aura.* "..."

Pickles: *She ran on her toes towards Alicia.* "Ice, such a wondrous element." *She moved into striking distance and slashed the ice shard across Alicia's face.*

Alicia: "Eek-" *She fell to the ground and a thin slice of blood ran down her nose.*

Pickles: *She pointed the ice shard to the ground at Alicia.* "I was hoping we could talk more." *The ice shard slowly extended, catching Alicia's attention.*

Alicia: "I've been fighting non-stop lately-" *She stared at the ice-made dagger Pickles flicked in her hand, noticing a slight reflection in it.*

Pickles: "..."

Alicia: "The fighting, I'm tired of it." *She raised her arm in a defensive manner.*

Pickles: (I know that tired feeling.) *She tightened her grip and the ice suddenly doubled in size, stabbing Alicia in the hand.*

Alicia: "Arh!" *She squealed in a high pitch tone and withdrew her arm.* "AQUA LIQUID" *She pushed her hand forward and a wave of water knocked Pickles back.*

Pickles: "Water?!" *She stepped back and clicked her fingers, watching the water instantly freeze.*

Alicia: *She stared at the splash-like ice sculpture covering Pickles.* "..."

Pickles: "Impressive." *She formed a fist and flicked her wrist, causing the ice to shatter.*

Alicia: *She shuffled back onto her feet and cautiously glanced at Pickles.* "G-GLACIA'S EDGE"

Pickles: "..." *She swayed her body and spun around.* "Ha!" *She slapped downwards as an ice pillar shot up from the ground.*

Alicia: "H-Wha-?!" *She watched Pickles slap the ice pillar into pieces, noticing it shatter away from her.*

Pickles: "The two of us using ice was coincidental, I'm going to be one of your worst opponents."

Alicia: (She is strong enough to shatter my ice with a slap!-) "W-Why?"

Pickles: "..." *She tightened her hand, causing an ice-made dagger to erupt in her hand.*

Alicia: (She uses ice too...) *She took a deep breath and bit her bottom lip.* "SHINING RAIN" *She raised her arms and lowered them, causing spears of light to rain down on Pickles.*

Pickles: *She gripped onto the ice dagger and raised it above her head, as it took shape of a shield.* "What element is that? Wind?!"

Alicia: (My Rostical? It feels like I haven't even used one yet-)

Pickles: *Her arm violently rocked back and forth, as the shield of ice blocked the spears of light.* (What is this?!)

Alicia: "AQUA LIQUID" *She swayed her arms and a wave of water rumbled towards Pickles.*

Pickles: "Water? It's basically ice-" *She glanced at the wave of water with a lack of concentration and nudged her foot towards it, causing it to instantly freeze.*

Alicia: *She pointed one finger at Pickles, watching the light continue to rain down on her.* (She is very strong, this could get very serious-)

Pickles: *She slightly looked past the ice shield, noticing a white glyph in the air.* (The rods of light are coming out from that glyph.)

Alicia: *She quickly glanced up The Divine Path, frowning in confusion.* (Why isn't anyone from Valhalla helping me?)

Pickles: *She threw the shield upwards and hit the white glyph, shattering the spears of light away.* "That light, it must've been condensed fire?"

Alicia: "SERENITY SWIRL" *She focused her attention back in front and four thin beams of light shot out from her finger, violently spiralling towards Pickles.*

Pickles: *She squinted her eyes and observed the beams of light which spiralled into striking distance.* (It's de-bonding the Neurons and Astragons in the air around it!) "Ougi, Divinity Shard." *She dropped to the ground and formed a square with her fingers, causing a blue ice wall to erupt in front of her.*

Alicia: (Ougi?!) *She watched the beams of light bounce off the wall and shoot into the air.* "It was deflected?"

*Alicia spoke under her breath, watching the beams of light sparkle before disintegrating into nothing.*

Alicia: "I never used that Rostical before, maybe I used it incorrectly?"

Pickles: *She stood up and walked around the ice, facing Alicia in a proud manner.* "My Ougi works similar to that move you just used."

Alicia: (Like Serenity Swirl?)

Pickles: "It repels all type of Neurons, it's as simple as that."

Alicia: "I've never heard of something like that."

Pickles: "Said the one with the unusual Remenistal." *She pointed up to where the light spears originated from.*

Alicia: *She formed fists and lowered her head.* "Just go away."

Pickles: "..." *She rubbed her wrists together and raised them in the air.*

Alicia: "Frosted skies reveal the truth, please with the power strike forward, FREEZING HOLLOWS" *She blew through her mouth and a pulse of mist blasted towards Pickles.*

Pickles: *She focused her attention on the sky outside The Divine Path.* "Bend, manipulate, focus-"

*Growing clouds materialised above Pickles and slowly expanded across the path.*

Pickles: (Manipulating the weather has always been my speciality.)

Alicia: *She watched the mist blow against Pickles like a miniature blizzard.* (I used this once in front of PKMY, she said it was something like a freezing storm.)

Pickles: *She gasped in shock and watched the miniature blizzard blow past her, as ice shards formed on one side of her body.* (I was too busy focusing the clouds inside this area I didn't notice I was getting directly hit by her Remenistal!)

Alicia: *She watched the mist fade away, noticing Pickles' frozen-like body.* "It was good meeting you." *She turned around with an emotionless face and started to walk up The Divine Path.*

Pickles: *The ice around her body suddenly shattered away and she stepped forward, glaring at Alicia's back.* "Don't talk like you've won the battle-"

Alicia: "'O holy powers draw towards me, HOLY LANCE" *She didn't turn around, ignoring a glowing white glyph which materialised underneath her.*

Pickles: "Turn around-"

*A white glyph shined under Pickles' feet and white strings suddenly wrapped themselves around her arms and legs.*

Pickles: "What is this?" *She looked down and gritted her teeth, trying to pull her arms up.* (This rope-like Remenistal isn't breaking.)

Alicia: "..."

Pickles: *She stopped struggling, looking at Alicia in a serious manner.* "Ougi-"

Alicia: (Now, I will go-)

Pickles: "Divinity Shard." *A blue wall of ice shot up in front of her, causing the glyph underneath to shatter and dissipate into nothing.*

Alicia: (She stopped the Rostical from completing.) *She turned around, spreading her arms.* "Unwritten holy laws, strike down my foe-"

Pickles: *She shook her hands, watching the once binding strings of light fade off her arms.* "There's nothing you can do-"

Alicia: *She looked up, noticing white ribbons float through the clouds.* "SHINING RAIN"

Pickles: *She stepped forward as thunder rumbled from the clouds.* (The clouds are steadily growing in size-) "Water is the energy source for ice, don't you agree?"

Alicia: "I've frozen over lakes to get to the other side." *She flicked her wrist, causing the ribbons to move like razor blades.*

Pickles: "Once it begins to rain, this match will be over." *It started to sprinkle.*

Alicia: "I-I will make sure it doesn't rain-" *She waved her arms downwards, blasting the spears of light towards Pickles.*

Pickles: "Harh!-" *She jumped to the side and backflipped down the path, avoiding the spears of light.*

Alicia: *She watched The Divine Path flicker each time the spears hit the ground.* (She's too experienced to get hit by that-) *She swayed her arms in thought, causing the spears of light to dissipate away.*

Pickles: *She flipped onto her knees and looked up to Alicia, flicking green hair out of her face.* "Time is not your friend."

Alicia: "Ougi." *She whispered under her breath with an echoing voice.*

Pickles: *Her eyes widened and she became more alert, as a ball of ice slowly grew in front of Alicia.* (It's taking shape to something! What is it!?)

----------

Isaac: *He smirked and stared at the massive dirt cloud, as several boulders floated around him.* "T-Too much for you to handle?"

PKMY: *She jumped out of the dirt cloud and slid across the ground on one foot, straightening her arms at Isaac.* "FLAMING WHEEL"

*PKMY shouted with an echoing voice, watching a swirl of fire spiral along the ground around Isaac.*

Isaac: *He rolled his eyes with a confident smirk and kicked the ground.* "Heh-" *A puff of dirt blew out the fire.*

PKMY: "Tssk!"

Holland: *He stood inside the dirt cloud, looking to his side from where PKMY jumped out from.* "Go!"

*Destiny flew out of a forming yellow glyph, watching it spiral behind her.*

Holland: (Did you get that?) *He shouted in thought, watching Destiny fly behind him.*

Destiny: (Yes. Screaming Gale.) *She tilted backwards and flapped her wings, blowing the dirt cloud towards Isaac.*

Isaac: "Argh!" *He closed his eyes, feeling the sand scrape past his face.*

Holland: (Her plan worked!) *He watched the floating boulders around Isaac fall to the ground.*

PKMY: *She looked up, watching Destiny flap in the air.* (Holly, keep the dickwod busy and I'll prepare a critical.)

Holland: *He nodded his head.* "Destiny, prepare your second move."

Destiny: (Yes!) *She flew high into the air and faced Isaac, extending her wings.*

Holland: "Fryfry, help us out!" *He shouted, watching a materialising light red pearl glow in his palm.*

Fryfry: *They swarmed out of a spiralling red glyph, cluttering together.* "Bzzzst."

PKMY: *She placed both hands behind her waist and pulled forward, causing wing-like sparks to scatter from her back.* (Ryukku-)

Isaac: *He shook his head and grunted, watching the dirt cloud clear.* "G-Grrr-ah-" *He pushed his arms up as if he was lifting weights and the boulders floated back into the air.*

PKMY: (I'll build up some Neurons in my arms and-)

Isaac: "Herourgh." *He pretended to throw a ball over his head, causing the boulders to blast towards PKMY and Holland.*

PKMY: "Wat?!" *She stared at the boulders with widening eyes.*
Holland: *He stepped back.* "Destiny!"

Destiny: (Feather Buster.) *She flapped her wings and feathers rained down in front of Holland.*

Fryfry: *They swarmed in front of PKMY and separated, causing a shield to light up.* (Myrror Shield.)

PKMY: *She watched the boulders hit the shield and deflect to the side.* (Whoa?)

Holland: *He started to relax, watching the feathers break down the boulder.* (Nice.)

Isaac: "Grr, what are those f-feathers made out of?!"

PKMY: *She watched Fryfry lower the shield in shock.* (Thanks-)

Isaac: "H-Here!" *He flashstepped on the ground next to Holland and kicked under his feet.*

Holland: "Arh!-" *Isaac swept him off his feet.*

Isaac: *He spun around and punched the ground, blasting a rock pillar towards Holland's face.* "N-Now die!"

Holland: "Crud!-" *He leant back, watching a shower of feathers crumble half of the rock pillar to the side.*

Destiny: (Feather Buster.) *She flapped her wings, gliding around.* (That was close, Holland-)

Isaac: *He smirked and raised his fist, readying to punch the ground again.* "Hah-"

PKMY: "Shit face!-"

Isaac: "What did you call-?"

PKMY: *She flashstepped above Isaac in the air, looking down at him.* (Move outta the way.)

Holland: (Got it-) *He noticed Isaac look up to PKMY, giving him time to stumble away.*

PKMY: *She fell into striking distance and swiftly moved her arm, slicing the Ryukku across.* "Yahoo!-"

Isaac: "Karh-" *He rocked to one side, as a deep slash mark appeared on his neck.*

PKMY: "Heh-" *She placed a hand on her side and the air rippled like water.* "Flying palm strike." *She pushed downwards and the ground exploded around Isaac.*

Isaac: "Argh-" *He tumbled across the ground and flipped onto his legs, continuing to slide backwards.*

PKMY: *She landed on one foot, twirling the Ryukku like a fan's blade.* "Heh."

Holland: (She's become much stronger since I last saw her fight in The Twilight Forest.)

*Destiny flew in a large circle and waited to aid the party, causing Isaac to look up in anger.*

Isaac: (That Scoldrant is really aggravating me!-) "Harh!" *He punched forward and spears of ground shot up towards Destiny.*

Fryfry: "Bzzz." *They swarmed around Destiny and blocked the spears with its shield.*

PKMY: *She suddenly flashstepped next to Isaac and smirked, leaning forward with a raised fist.* "Grah-" *She punched Isaac on the face, causing her knuckles to crack.* "Argh-?"

Isaac: *He looked surprised at PKMY's presence.* (She flashsteps faster than me, no! Maybe even faster than Brazza-)

PKMY: *She flashstepped away from Isaac and reappeared in a safe distance.* (My hand, his face was hard as a rock!) *She grunted in thought, rubbing her knuckles in pain.*

Holland: (Come on out!-) *He shouted in thought with an echoing voice, watching Twotters elegantly pounce in front of him.*

Isaac: "Cave Hounds." *He punched the ground and two dogs made of stone erupted out from two dirt clouds.* "S-Sick them!"

PKMY: *She flicked her wrist to overcome the pain.* "I'm not going to go down over something so shitty, loser! ICICLE ED-"

Isaac: *He flashstepped behind PKMY and formed a fist, punching her in the back of the head.* "Ha-"

Holland: "Dammit! Amy!" *His distress alerted Twotters into action.*

Twotters: (Harmonic Pulsar.) *She faced Isaac with extending whiskers and touched them, causing a visible swirl of echoing violin to grow in front of her.*

PKMY: "Tssk-" *She frowned in pain and shook her head, twirling around.*

Isaac: "Rock Pillar." *He stamped forward and two thin pillars of rock shot up and hit PKMY's wrists, skilfully knocking her weapons out of her hands.*

PKMY: *Without losing her twirling's momentum she quickly jabbed forward, punching towards Isaac's face.* "Hah!-"

Isaac: *He blocked PKMY's fist with a sturdy arm movement.* "...-"

PKMY: *She gritted her teeth with widening eyes, hiding her pain.* "Tssk-" *She quickly grabbed onto Isaac's arm and flicked her legs up, kicking him across the face.*

Isaac: *He swayed to the side, squinting one eye.* "P-Piercing Land." *He kicked the ground and a spear-like rock shot up, hitting PKMY in the chest.*

PKMY: "Gah-" *She slid back and stopped, discreetly glancing at graze marks on her arm.* (Even his arms feel like stone-)

Isaac: *He quickly grabbed the spear-like rock before it touched the ground and sprinted towards PKMY.* "I-I can see your death-"

PKMY: "Tssk." *She gently held the back of her head and leant to one side, flashstepping out of Isaac's view.*

Twotters: "Reow-" *She jumped forward and a blast of sound instantly exploded around Isaac, causing rock to erupt into the air.*

Isaac: *He raised his arms as shards of ground hit his head.* "Using my own element against me!"

Twotters: *She quickly faced the two dog-like stone sculptures and pounced forward, blasting a ball of visible sound towards them.* (Harmonic Pulsar.)

Isaac: *He watched the ball of sound hit the sculptures and blasted them back into crumbles of sand, listening to chords of echoing violin.* "D-Damn you, Scoldrant! Swirling Sandpit."

*The ground acted like quicksand around Twotters, causing her to hiss in fear.*

Twotters: *She tried to pull her paw up, watching it sink into the swirling sand underneath her.* (Holland! I can't get out!)

Holland: (I'll get you!-)

Isaac: "Ha ha." *He laughed at Holland who ran to Twotters' aid.*

PKMY: "Hey-" *She grunted and held the Ryukku in each hand.*

Isaac: "What-?" *He looked to his side and saw PKMY's fist before being smashed onto the ground.*

PKMY: "Heh." *She smirked watching Isaac roll on the ground in shock.*

Isaac: *He slowly leant up and held his face, smiling at PKMY.* "How're th-those knuckles of yours?" *He lowered his hand, revealing a crack in his skin.*

PKMY: "I used part of my weapon this time-" *She noticed sand on the Ryukku's handle.* "Heh, didn't hurt at all."

Twotters: (Holland!)

Holland: "I'm coming." *He grunted at Twotters and jumped over chunks of rock, watching her continue to slowly sink into the quicksand.*

Isaac: *He stood up and looked at PKMY with an angry face.* "I'll show you s-something that will hurt!"

PKMY: *She sighed in a bored manner and jumped up, throwing a Ryukku downwards at Isaac.* "Swift Storm."

Isaac: *He stepped back and bent at the knees, preparing to block the Ryukku.* "The t-two of you have strange abilities-" *A blast of silver wind caused him to slide back.*

Destiny: (We will win in numbers.) *She flapped her wings, blowing a strong constant gust of wind at Isaac from high in the air.*

PKMY: *She touched the Ryukku in her hand, causing a brown glyph to form around the other Ryukku in the air.* "Yahoo!" *She flicked her finger and a swarm of Ryukkus suddenly showered towards Isaac.*

Destiny: *She stopped flapping and focused her attention away, quickly diving towards Twotters.* "Meehehehe."

Holland: *He bent down and grabbed Twotters, pulling her out of the quicksand.* "Destiny!-" *He grunted, as he threw Twotters into the air.*

Twotters: "Meow." *She casually landed on Destiny's back and glided across the battlefield.*

Isaac: *He grunted and pointed up, ignoring the Ryukku which shot in the ground like bullets.* "C-Come on."

*A large boulder shot up from the ground and hit PKMY out of the air.*

PKMY: *She awkwardly landed on the ground, wiping her mouth in pain.* "Dammit-"

Isaac: "Hah!" *He stood in a powerful-like stance and formed a fist, controlling the boulder he used to just hit PKMY with.* "H-Hah!" *He punched behind him, causing the boulder to drop downwards.*

Holland: "Amy!-" *Freya suddenly shot out from a spiralling purple glyph in front of his chest, instantly growling at Isaac.*

PKMY: *She looked up and noticed the boulder which fell directly above her.* "Ah-" *She quickly rolled out of the way and the ground rumbled, as the boulder cracked upon impact.*

Isaac: *He looked at his arm and shoulder, ripping out several Ryukkus in frustration.* (Stupid girl!)

Freya: (PKMY?!)

PKMY: (I'm alright.. His attacks are slow but they hit hard. He also takes advantage of his slow-moving attacks by setting up multiple attacks at once.)

Holland: *He watched the sandpit stop moving as the ground reverted back to normal.* (He also catches us off guard with random quick attacks-)

Isaac: *He looked around, stepping back in an annoyed manner.* "There's h-heaps of you!" *He smirked as if he knew his presence was worth multiple opponents.*

Freya: *The purple ring around her iris rotated, causing her vision to zoom into Isaac's face.* (Why is he smiling?)

PKMY: "You're the one that wanted to fight!"

Isaac: "F-Fine, I'll just get straight to it then! Ougi." *He leant forward as if he had a hunchback.*

Holland: (Amy be careful-)

PKMY: "Don't baby me, I'm fine, shithead." *She grunted at Holland, causing him to smile and focus his attention to Isaac.*

Isaac: "Rock Copies." *Sand slowly spewed out from the ground and piled up, looking like miniature volcanoes.*

Destiny: *She watched from a bird's eye view.* (What's going on? Should we attack him now?)

Holland: (Seems like he's wide open-)

PKMY: (No, don't! He's poured a condensed sphere of Astragons around him, he'll likely counterattack! I know it sucks, but we gotta wait for him to get out of that phase!)

Twotters: *She gently dug her claws into Destiny and leant to the side, watching the sand continue to pile up.* (Intriguing.) *She thought with no emotion.*

Freya: *She growled through gritted teeth, frizzing her fur up in an intimidating manner.* (Is he a Rostical User?)

Holland: (Maybe.) *He looked unsure.*

PKMY: *She frowned and straightened her body posture.* "..."

Isaac: "Th-This should be fair now." *Four piles of sand grew to the height of Isaac and started to take shape.*

PKMY: "Huh?" *The forms moulded themselves into Isaac, causing her jaw to drop.*

*Five copies of Isaac stared at Holland and PKMY, as they all smirked with evil-like frowns.*

Holland: "There's five of them." *He grunted and stepped back, as a grey pearl materialised in his palm.*

PKMY: (This won't just be a walk across the park as I was anticipating.)

----------

Brazza: "Ougi?" *He mumbled with his deep voice and smirked.*

Lance: "I don't know wat's goin' on.." *He grunted under his breath, unsure what to do.*

Nathan: (He's smiling?) "You won't be smiling after this-" *The sword suddenly lost its image.*

Lance: *He had a flashback of Nathan using his Ougi at Battling Oxident.* (I remember now, I did watch his match after all.)

Brazza: (The sword? Is it invisible-?) *He noticed a falling leaf cut in half above Nathan, causing him to notice the position of his arm.* (It can't be invisible, he didn't swing his arm upwards for the leaf to-)

Nathan: "I won't give you time to analyse my Ougi-" *He jumped towards Brazza into striking distance.*

Brazza: (I better take this loser for real.) "Jolt Cage." *He spread his arms and strings of lightning enveloped his entire body, giving the illusion he was in a cage.*

Nathan: *His arm lost its image as he frowned in concentration.* "..."

Brazza: *He folded his arms and smirked, as the lightning danced around him.* (Look at him try.) *He moved his tongue in his mouth, watching Nathan grunt in deep concentration.*

Nathan: *He paused and watched the lightning continue its defensive-like dance.* (I'll focus all my Neurons into this Ougi, condense my Astragons around the sword, break his defences and strike-)

Lance: "Your attack! It's having no effect!"

Brazza: *He glanced at Lance and looked back to Nathan with a confident smirk.* "Your dumb friend is right, not even my lightning is being distorted by your Ougi-"

Nathan: *He smirked as if he already knew.* "That's because I haven't struck yet."

Brazza: "Wha-?" *A stream of lightning broke its movements and scattered behind him.* "Huh?!"

Nathan: *He took a step forward, causing the leaves on the ground to burst away.* "..."

Brazza: *He looked to the side with widening eyes.* (I can't believe this-)

Lance: *He noticed deep slash marks appear on the ground around Nathan.* (I remember this attack, it pushed Angler back even when she was in her crazy fighting mood.)

Brazza: *His hair flicked around his face, as swirls of visible wind sliced the air around Nathan.* (How is this wind being generated?! The force of his strikes-?)

Lance: *Slight gusts of wind blew past him and cut his cheek.* "Ah, shit-!?" *He held his cheek in shock, quickly stepping back in a wary manner.*

Brazza: *He spread his arms, attempting to fix the distorted lightning.* (I'm an Elementalist! Master of my element and yet this man is keeping me on edge!)

Nathan: (I've learnt to incorporate the Air Slash Azure Burst with my Ougi.)

Brazza: *He watched his lightning disrupt in a pathway-like manner, leaving him vulnerable.* "Dang it-" (More!) *He pushed both arms forward, causing the lightning to intensify.*

Nathan: (The thickness of his lightning grew-)

Lance: "Oi, Natalie, I've seen your Ougi, it won't be enough to defeat that Brendza guy!"

Nathan: (Natalie? Is he seriously a guy version of Luna-?)

Brazza: "Brendza?" *Static sounds buzzed from the thick streams of lightning.*

Lance: "Was it Brenda-?"

Nathan: "I've long mastered my Ougi since when you last saw it."

Lance: "Are you sure-?"

Nathan: "Hemph-" *He smirked and his entire body disappeared.*
Brazza: "H-Huh?" *He groaned in a deep voice.*

Nathan: *He ran in slow motion towards Brazza.* (Unlike flashstepping, this technique causes immense strain on all my muscles.) *He cautiously stepped over the lightning, avoiding their frozen-like streams around Brazza.*

Brazza: "Where did he go-?"
Lance: "He flashstepped again?!"

Nathan: *His image appeared next to Brazza, slicing his shoulder-blade.* "Harh."

Brazza: "Ah!" *He swayed down and shot rays of lightning, which burnt the airborne leaves around him.*

Nathan: "..." *He disappeared before the bolts of lightning touched him.*
Brazza: (Missed-)

Lance: *He raised his arm over his face, watching the rays of lightning shoot out of Brazza's hand.* (This Brenda guy makes my Lightning Blast look like shit-)

Nathan: *His image appeared below, slicing Brazza across the knees.* (How do you like it?)

Brazza: "Crud!" *He looked down at Nathan's disappearing image and bent at the knees, gritting his teeth.*

Nathan: *He swirled around Brazza, carefully avoiding the lightning in slow motion.* "Hermph-" *He appeared face to face, slicing downwards before disappearing.*

Lance: (This looks like one of them speedy-ninja attacks in an RPG-)

Brazza: *He watched blood drip down his chin, causing him to frown in a serious manner.* (He won't last long if he keeps bugging me like this-)

Lance: *He looked shocked, watching Nathan's image disappear and reappear around Brazza.* (Nathan might be owning Brenda, but somethin' doesn't feel right?)

Brazza: *He looked to his side and watched Nathan slash the sword across his waist, before flashstepping out of his sight.* (That hurt!-)

Lance: *He continued to watch in awe, as Nathan effectively cut Brazza all over his body.* (He's flashstepping before Brendza can even respond to the attacks!)

Nathan: "Harh." *He appeared above Brazza and both his arms were blurred, as cuts formed all over Brazza's face.*

Brazza: *Streaks of blood dripped down his chin, as thin cuts continued to form over his face.* "Not cool."

Nathan: *He stayed in mid-air, smirking to himself in thought.* (By swinging my arms at blinding speeds, it acts as a propeller, keeping me airborne-)

Brazza: "Thunder Boom." *He punched his hands together, causing a magnetic-like pulse to knock Nathan onto the ground.*

Nathan: (Arugh!-)
Lance: *The pulse suddenly expanded and the force knocked him off his feet.* "Whoa-"

*Leaves rained down from the nearby trees, due to Brazza's attack.*

Brazza: *He listened to the thumps of Lance and Nathan hitting the ground.* (He pushed me this far? At this rate, I'd need to rest before going after the next target-)

Lance: *Leaves landed on his face, causing him to open his eyes.* (That's goin' to be the last time I get knocked on my ass-) *He grunted and slowly stood up on his feet, brushing leaves off his shirt.*

Nathan: *His arms twitched in pain, as he looked at large veins, which showed all over his arms and hands.* "That's s-skill.."

Brazza: *He raised his arm, wiping an ongoing stream of blood around his eyebrow, attempting to stop it from going into his eye.* (He hasn't even used Remenistal? I can't believe this. Dakota would laugh in my face-)

Nathan: (That was skill.. But it wasn't-.. That pure level of skill I took so long to achieve-) *He panted and kneeled up off the ground, watching his sword twitch in a heartbeat-like manner.*

Brazza: "Well-" *The armour-like bracelets on his wrists shattered onto the ground.* "My armour? H-How did you do that?!"

Nathan: "I'm more surprised-" *He coughed, shaking his head.* (Was that it? He's still standing..)

Brazza: "About what?"

Nathan: "That none of your body parts had fallen to the ground." *He took deep breaths.*

Brazza: "I won't deny that the skill you expressed was life-threatening, but you gotta be an all-rounder." *He winked in a taunt-like manner and stood up straight, rubbing his knees as if nothing happened.*

Lance: (I thought Nathan cut him at the knees, I wouldn't expect someone to just suddenly stand-)

Brazza: "Aight-" *He smirked in confidence and stared at Nathan.* "Payback."

Nathan: "Get over yourself-"

Brazza: "Righto? Ougi."

Nathan: "H-How? Not with the damage, I dealt on you!" *He mumbled in disbelief, staring at Brazza in a defeated manner.*

Brazza: "You provided some entertainment, but now, this is where it finishes for you-"

Lance: *He noticed Nathan's weakened condition, causing him to run up to Brazza.* "Dude, you won the fight, aye."

Brazza: "Don't interfere." *He turned around and punched Lance in the stomach, as streams of red lightning zigzagged around his fist.*

Lance: "Karh-herh." *He wheezed, twitching in a frozen-like manner.*

Nathan: *He stared at Lance's back in shock.* (.. Why-?)

Brazza: "Hmph." *He pushed his fist further, causing Lance to blast backwards.*

Lance: "Gah-" *He rolled across the ground, as strings of red lightning zapped around his stomach.*

Nathan: (I can't move my legs..) *He looked to his feet in a worried manner.* (A repercussion of being in such a highly advanced and stressful flashstep.)

Brazza: "Hmph." *He smirked and looked back to Nathan, raising his hand.*

Nathan: (Damned Rostical Users!-)

Brazza: "Boring." *He clicked his fingers and bright yellow lightning as thick as trees struck down from the sky.*

Nathan: "Argh!" *A ray of yellow lightning hit him in the stomach, causing him to yell in pain.* "K-Karh!.."

*The leaves around Nathan became crisp and suddenly wrinkled charcoal-black caused by the heat.*

Lance: *He grunted and covered his eyes, as bright lightning shot from every angle around the forest.* "Th-This is crazy!-"

Nathan: (Luna.. Bella.. Rach, everyone.. I'm sorry.)

Brazza: "They say natural storms of any element are always more powerful than man-made Remenistal.." *He watched several tree branches violently snap in half, listening to the breaking bark with a smirk.* "But I've actually never seen lightning as thick as mine."

Nathan: *His body violently twitched and he released the sword.* "N-N-No-"

Brazza: "Truth is, I could've stopped your heart from just a tiny zap of lightning, but I chose to fight you with respect..." *He stood in a casual pose, causing the thick lightning to suddenly burst into separating strings of vein-like lightning.*

Nathan: *He suddenly threw up and collapsed to his side, struggling to breathe.* "N-Nnngh-"

Brazza: (He's still alive?)

Nathan: "N-Nnn-..." *He gagged for air and stopped twitching as his head became limp to one side.*

----------

Dakota: *She spread her arms, keeping balance on the massive wave she rode.* "You!"

Tyler: *He gasped and looked around helpless.* "... Y-Yes...?"

Dakota: "That face of yours, it looks like you pissed yourself, but I can't tell because you're already drenched like a soaked rodent!"

Tyler: "I-I..." *He nervously twitched, unsure what to say.*

Dakota: *She glared downwards at Tyler, as the water splashed around her feet.* "Knocking me off the cliff, unforgivable!" *She motioned both arms towards Tyler and two waves spiralled from her sides.*

Tyler: "H-Huh!?" *The waves crashed on the ground and they exploded in a line forming a wall of water.*

Dakota: (Aquatic Rapids.) *She clicked her fingers and the water erupted into a swirling vortex around Tyler.*

Tyler: *His hair rapidly flapped due to the movement of the water's current.* "Wait!-" *The waves collided against each other, causing him to hold his breath in a swirl of bubbles.*

Dakota: *She smirked and cautiously amplified the water's pressure.* (I'll be sure not to ever get surprised like that again.)

Tyler: *He squinted his eyes shut, firmly holding onto his RPG for comfort.* (Am I going to die?)

Dakota: *She focused on the water, sighing in a bored manner.* (If the pressure doesn't break his body, he'll drown for sure.)

*A white flash shined in the water, causing Dakota to lean forward in shock.*

Dakota: "What was that?" *Her whispers were consumed by the noises of the moving water.* "Does he have more tricks in that bag?"

?????: "MYSTIC SHIELD" *A woman's voice echoed as she hummed on a high note.*

Dakota: "W-Who's there?" *She scanned across the ground and over her shoulder, shaking her head in confusion.* (Where-?)

?????: "Up here!"

Dakota: *She looked up and noticed an eagle's wing slap her across the face.* "Graoth-" *The wave under her momentarily lost its current, as she wheezed in shock.*

Tyler: *He choked and wheezed on all fours, as water streamed from his hair.* "I-I thought that was the end.." *His pants sounded confined in the small glowing shield, causing him to look around in shock.* (A shield? Whose shield? Chrisma's?!)

*Tyler squealed in thought, watching the swirling water gush around the shield.*

Dakota: *She grunted and noticed a woman riding on the back of a large eagle.* "Whoever you are, for my master I will defeat you!"

?????: *She flew on the eagle across the cliff, gliding towards the swirling water.* (Tyler..)

Dakota: "Answer me!"

?????: "..." *She pointed towards the light in the swirling water and opened her hand.* "MYSTIC SHIELD STRIKE"

*The shield suddenly popped, exploding the water around Tyler.*

Dakota: (My water!)

Tyler: *He coughed and took a deep breath, instantly staring at Apollo in confusion.* "J-Joy?"

Joy: *She nudged her foot, causing Apollo to flap his wings.* "Does Season know his good researcher and friend, is putting himself in such danger?!" *She smiled as Apollo glided around Tyler, causing her robes to flap.*

Dakota: (Unforgivable...) *She formed fists and looked down, staring at Joy from high up in the air.* "Grrarh!" *She screamed and bullets of condensed water shot towards Apollo.*

Joy: "Water can't be shot from this distance-" *A pebble-sized water hit Apollo on the wing and exploded through the other side.*

Apollo: *He squawked in pain, as red feathers floated past the wound.* "..."

Tyler: "Ah-" *He squealed and raised his arms in a defensive manner, watching the feathers slowly sway to the ground.*

Joy: (I'm sorry, feathered friend! If I didn't underestimate her power, you wouldn't have been hurt-)

Apollo: "S-Squar-" *He flapped, stabilising his flight.*

Joy: "Frigid stress no more hiding-" *She closed her eyes and sung on a low note, raising one arm above her head.*

Apollo: *He glanced over his shoulder and noticed Joy awkwardly holding onto him by one hand.* (I'll keep it stabilised for her-) *He tilted his wings and shifted weight, causing him to glide smoothly for Joy.*

Dakota: *She noticed a blue glyph swirl around Joy's arm.* "Ice!"

Joy: "Release and bring upon your frozen wrath-" *She opened her eyes, intensely staring at Dakota.*

Dakota: "No!" *She screamed and clapped her hands forward, shooting more water-made bullets at Joy.*

Joy: "FRIGID DISTRESS" *She dropped her arm and moved her hand in a circular motion, causing a snake-like swirl of ice to slither in front of her.*

Tyler: *He looked up, frozen in fear.* "...-"

Joy: (Quick!) *She watched the ice slither to the side in a defensive manner, effectively freezing the water bullets in mid-air.*

Apollo: (She used the Remenistal itself to shield us-)

Dakota: *She watched ice pebbles fall to the ground, causing her to grunt with impatience.* (Being close range would be more effective with these type of opponents-) *She pushed forward and the wave rumbled over the ledge and across the ground towards Tyler.*

Tyler: "J-Joy!" *He stood up with a gasp and turned around, starting to run towards the forest.*

Joy: (I won't be able to help him if he runs into the forest-) "Do you have any special skills or even Remenistal?" *She calmly spoke to Apollo.*

Apollo: "..." *He shook his head as if he could understand her words.*

Joy: (Okay-) *She glanced at Dakota, watching her surf the wave towards Tyler.*

Dakota: "Unforgivable!"

Joy: "MYSTIC SHIELD" *She hummed on a high note, causing a silver shield to rise in front of Dakota.*

Dakota: "Arh?" *She hit the shield and her body fully pressed against it, as a powerful current crashed on to her back.*

Joy: *She watched water spray on the sides of the shield, causing her to smile in relief.* "Tyler, it's fine, she's!-" *She looked to the side and watched him disappear into the forest, as the trees hid his presence.*

Apollo: (Knowing she could reach us before-) "Sqcork." *He flapped his wings, gently hovering higher into the air.*

Dakota: *She closed her eyes and punched the shield, causing a powerful pulse to suddenly push the water current back.* (Un-for-givable!)

Joy: *The water stopped moving, causing her to look down at Dakota.* (Why did it stop so suddenly?)

Dakota: *She opened her eyes and the water swirled into a whirlpool around her, causing Joy's shield to shatter.* (That boy, I won't let his actions be ignored.) *She touched the burn mark on her face, growling in recollection.*

Apollo: *He squawked and flapped his wings, flying higher into the air.* (I've only seen that level of manipulation by one person-)

Dakota: "I will impress my master by presenting all your heads!" *She spun on one foot and faced upwards, opening her hand at Apollo.* "Crashing Pool."

Joy: *She looked down and noticed Dakota staring up at them.* "I don't think a water-based Remenistal could reach this high without the aid of natural elements."

Apollo: *He continued to fly higher into the air, looking down at Dakota from a bird's eye view.* (A pure Remenistal User can't reach this high-)

Joy: *She glanced at the treetops, pouting in thought.* (But I don't want to underestimate her again-)

*A swirl of white foamy water suddenly formed a sphere around Apollo, causing Joy to gasp with widening eyes.*

Joy: "Dive!-"

Dakota: (Drown!) *She closed her hand, causing the sphere of water to implode before Apollo could respond.*

*Dakota breathed heavily and stamped on the ground, causing a small pulse of water to circle around her.*

Dakota: *She flicked her wet hair over her shoulder, scanning the forest.* "I can't sense him..? Come to think of it, I never could sense him."

Tyler: *He panted through his mouth as he ran through the forest.* (Don't look back! Go through as many Spacial Funnels and Reality Sekais as possible!)

Dakota: *She flicked her hands up, causing a wave of water to gush out of the ground.* (Maybe he's good at masking his Neurons and Astragons?)

*Dakota pushed forward and rode the wave towards the forest with killing intent.*

Tyler: *He jumped over roots and quickly hid behind a thick tree.* (I can feel the rumbles of that woman's water.) *He shivered in fear, tightly closing his eyes.* (It's really cold-)

Dakota: "You've left pretty visible footsteps to track." *Her yells caused Tyler to gasp in fear, drawing her attention to a thick tree.* "Found you!"

Tyler: (How did she catch up so fast?!)

Dakota: "Unforgivable! I said I found you!" *She smiled and the wave of water slowly separated under her feet, causing her to touch the ground.*

Tyler: *He sat in the foetal position, slightly rocking back and forth.* (Please leave me alone!-)

Dakota: *She raised her hands, causing blades of water to swirl around her.* "Now-"

?????: "Joy, Apollo, take her!"

*A man shouted, causing Dakota to quickly look behind her in anger.*

Dakota: (He tricked me? Using this obvious trail as a distraction to get back into Silver Wind Island?) *She lowered her arms, causing the water to splash on to the ground.*

Tyler: *He heard the water gushing away, causing him to slowly open his eyes in confusion.* (Why is she leaving?)

*Tyler silently peaked around the tree and noticed streams of water moving on their own accord out of the forest.*

Dakota: *She jumped in a dive-like manner out of the forest, as water erupted behind her.* "You're smarter than I thought, boy." *She noticed Joy and Apollo standing on the ground, causing her eyes to widen.*

Apollo: *Dakota's presence caused him to raise his wings.* (There she is!)

Dakota: "How are you two alive? That Remenistal-based Azure Burst should've crushed that Scoldrant's wings?!"

Joy: "You're rushing yourself, you've had several occasions to ensure we were defeated."

Dakota: "Well then-" *She clapped her hands and water rumbled from the ocean.* "How will you survive the pressure of the ocean depths itself?!"

Apollo: *He felt the ground rumble, causing him to flap his wings in a wary manner.* "Sqcork."

Dakota: "Well?"

Joy: "But we quickly thought of a plan."

Dakota: "Plan?"

Chrisma: "-Give me some light-" *She sung with an echoing voice and cupped her hands, watching a red glyph flash under her feet.*

Dakota: *She grunted with a frown and looked to her side, staring at Chrisma with a surprised expression.* "How-?"

Chrisma: "FLAME BOLT" *She pushed forward and four fireballs shot towards Dakota.*

Dakota: "Grr-" *She punched downwards, causing a wave of water to erupt on her side.*

Joy: (She's able to create a significant amount of water in such a short amount of time. Why was Chrisma and Tyler fighting such a thing-?)

Dakota: *Fire stringed around the water as it blocked Chrisma's Rostical.* "How did you survive the fall?"

Chrisma: "Whoup whoup." *She ignored Dakota, cupping her hands.* "FLAME BOLT" *She pushed forward, shooting two small fireballs at Dakota.*

Joy: (Without the incantation?)

Dakota: "Aqua Talons." *She screamed and scratched the air, slicing the fireballs with scratch-like water streams.*

Chrisma: *She watched the fire splinter into nothing, causing her to tug her robes in a worried manner.* "..."

Dakota: "You know, there's only one thing that's annoying me."

Joy: "And what may that be?"

Dakota: "The gap in our power, and yet, you still haven't fallen by my hands."

Joy: "If you believe in yourself, you can achieve anything in your grasp."

Dakota: "Ha ha harh."

Chrisma: "She's right!-"

Dakota: "Fine, Ougi." *She sounded serious and suddenly faced Joy, sprinting towards her.*

Joy: *She stepped back in shock.* "MYSTIC SHIELD" *She hummed and a silver shield rose around her and Apollo.*

Chrisma: *She gasped, watching Dakota run into striking distance towards Joy.* (Joy!-)

Dakota: *She sprinted past Joy and Apollo and jumped off the cliff, causing her hair to rapidly flap to each side.* (My favourite element, become as one-) *She thought with a calm face, diving into the rough and violent ocean.*

Joy: *She looked over her shoulder in shock, pausing in confusion.* "Did she decide to end it herself?"

Apollo: *He looked around with a spiralling purple ring around his iris.* (Nothing? But she did say Ougi.)

Chrisma: "J-Joy!" *She sounded excited to see her.*

Joy: "My, your aura has become much brighter, been on any adventures-?"

*Rocks around the cliff behind Joy suddenly crumbled, causing the shield to violently crack and shatter.*

Joy: (I don't-?) *She gasped in confusion, watching glass-like shards of shield spiral past her.*

Chrisma: "Joy!"

Dakota: *She rose up from the ocean, floating in a pool of water.* (My Ougi draws the Astragons in the water allowing me to breathe in it.) *Her arms and legs whipped like tentacles, as the layer of water formed a strong hold around her body.*

Joy: *She turned around and faced Dakota, observing the water in shock.* "I don't know why I didn't see it sooner. Remenistal cannot do that, you're an Elementalist!"

Dakota: "Yes-" *Her voice sounded bubbly due to the water.*

Chrisma: "Get in?! How can she talk in the water-?"

Dakota: (It took me years to acquire this level of manipulation.) *She waved her arm and whipped the water tentacle in the air, watching it extend with a smirk.* "Ha!"

Joy: *She listened to the snap-like sounds, noticing the tentacle whip towards her.* "Oh my! Watch out, Apollo!-"

Dakota: *She swayed her arm and the tentacle swept Apollo and Joy across the head, knocking them onto the ground.* "Ha! Lucky your necks didn't snap! More fun for me!"

Chrisma: "Joy!" *She watched Joy and Apollo slide on their sides, before lying motionless on the ground.*

Dakota: "All my Azure Bursts have increased in strength by three times. Now, time to die.." *She glared at Apollo and Joy and crossed her arms, tensing her fingers in a claw-like manner.*

Chrisma: "FLAME BOLT" *She cupped her hands and pushed it towards Dakota, shooting a barrage of fireballs at Dakota.*

Dakota: (Huh?) *Several fireballs hit her in the face and stomach, causing steam to instantly sizzle.*

Chrisma: *She groaned with buckling knees and fired off another barrage of fireballs, as flashes of red light shined off her cheeks.* (All are direct hits!)

Dakota: *She yawned, watching the flames extinguish.* (That didn't even push me back.) *She smiled and leant down, slithering on her water tentacles like a snake.*

Chrisma: (No effect!)

Dakota: "My Ougi is ongoing until I run out of water." *She smirked, motioning her head behind her to the ocean.*

Chrisma: (The ocean...) *She gasped in realisation and stepped forward with widening eyes.* "Joy, we have to retreat!"

Dakota: "Hahahaha harh, unforgivable! Retreating is a coward's way out." *She raised her left arm and the tentacle whipped high into the air.*

Chrisma: *She lowered her arms, shaking her head in a defeated manner.* "N-No..."

Dakota: "Did you know, a water's current has the strength to literally rip a body in half?" *The tentacle straightened as a water current visibly rushed into the tentacle.*

Joy: *She coughed out water and placed her hands on the ground, trying to raise her head.* "C-Chrisma, run-"

Dakota: "Too late." *She grunted, as she slammed the tentacle directly on top of Chrisma, causing the ground to crack and rumble.* "Hahahaha harh." *She watched an eruption of water burst into the air.*

Apollo: *His feathers were drenched with water.* (Flying will be much harder now, I better retreat and rest-) *He squawked as his body disintegrated into white orbs.*

Dakota: *The tentacle lost its solid-like current and whipped in the air like jelly.* "You're next, Joy." *She smirked and faced Joy, who sat on the ground slightly exhausted.*

Joy: *She looked at Dakota and gasped, causing her to cough.* "O-Oh my?!"

Dakota: "Yeah, I heard your name." *She smirked and her tentacle suddenly exploded, causing her to squeal in fright.*

Joy: *She watched her tentacle spray down like rain.* "What?"

Dakota: "What did you do?!" *She glared at Joy in anger, causing the ocean to rumble.*

Joy: "That was not my doing-"

?????: "It was my doing." *He smirked, as he stood in front of Chrisma, watching it rain down around him.*

Dakota: *She glanced at Chrisma who stood behind the man.* (She's unharmed!?)

Joy: "Cameron." *She sighed in relief, causing Dakota to frown in response.*

Cameron: "Fight someone on your own level." *He stepped forward, watching water rise from the ocean behind Dakota.*

Dakota: "My own level?" *She squinted her eyes in anger, as the water reformed the tentacle that exploded.*

----------

*Sandy gusts of wind blew past Ridley, as he walked away from swirls of white orbs.*

Ridley: *He watched the desert-like environment suddenly revert back into the cave.* "That was a splendid fight, ladies."

*Ridley rubbed the side of his head and started to walk out of the cave, listening to his feet scrape against the ground.*

Ridley: (I have two things left to do before I set up the Spacial Funnel to leave this world.)

*Ridley frowned in determination and looked ahead, noticing bright light shine at the end of the cave.*

Ridley: *He buckled at the knees and quickly stepped to the side, resting on the wall.* "Oh dear.. I haven't been in such a weakened condition, since-"

*Ridley spoke under his breath and looked down, taking deep breaths.*

Ridley: "Before I acquired my dark affinity."

*Moving shadows at the end of the cave caught Ridley's attention.*

Ridley: "I better keep going. I'd be more at peace knowing no person can simply catch me off guard." *He stepped away from the wall and faced the light, taking another deep breath.*

*Sounds of dripping water echoed throughout Concern's Gate.*

Ridley: *He regained his composure and ran towards the light, jumping out of the cave into the bright sunlight.* "W-What?!"

*Ridley looked around surprised and noticed desert, causing him to shake his head in disagreement.*

Ridley: "Maserio?! What has happened-?!"

*Jewel and Teresa flashstepped on each side and jabbed their weapons towards Ridley's head.*

Ridley: "Impossible-?!" *He bent back and watched sparks splinter past each other's weapons.*

Teresa: "Tcch-"
Jewel: "I thought we had him then!-"

Ridley: *Shadow enveloped his hand, as he formed a fist.* (I'm still in the illusion-)

Teresa: "Hmph-" *She elegantly spun around and sliced the Pentarang across Ridley's stomach.*

Ridley: *He watched blood flick on to the sand, listening to fabric rip.* (Argh-) *He held his stomach in pain, keeping more attention on Jewel.*

Teresa: "..." *She continued to spin and sliced the Pentarang across Ridley's face.*

Jewel: *She closed her eyes and started to dance with a glowing shade of blue.* "By the Sacred Dancers, Azure Burst, number seventy eight, Mind Spalbinder-"

Ridley: *He quickly ducked under Teresa's attack and jumped to his side, facing Jewel.* "I apologise, but two against one isn't fair-"

Jewel: *She opened her eyes, watching Ridley stand face to face in shock.* "Wha-?"

Ridley: *He punched Jewel in the face, causing a shadow-like ring to puff around her head.* (Relying on Teresa to back you up-) "You shouldn't have closed your eyes this close to an opponent-"

Jewel: "Kahk-" *The force of Ridley's punch caused her skull to crack.*

Teresa: *She watched Jewel's eyes roll back, as she dropped on her knees.* "Tcch-"

Ridley: "Teresa-"

*Jewel giggled in an eerie echoing-like manner, causing Ridley to pause.*

Ridley: *He cautiously stepped back, staring at Jewel in confusion.* (Another illusion?)

Jewel: "Heetee." *Her body turned to sand and her laugh echoed in the distance.*

Ridley: (I won't be fooled by the same trick-) "DEMONIC SIOVANCE"

*A black glyph drew itself on the ground in the distance, causing Teresa to face Ridley in confusion.*

Teresa: *She held the Pentarang with both hands, slightly frowning with a smirk.* "Where are you aiming?"

Ridley: "I've been fixated on your natural abilities. They're the same as mine."

*Dark-blue strings wrapped themselves in the air from the glyph in the distance.*

Teresa: "Hoh?"

Ridley: "Naturally born with an incredible growth in power, intelligence, stamina-"

Jewel: "Grah!" *She screamed in pain, as her body warped on top of the dark glyph.*

Teresa: *She quickly glanced to Jewel, watching her struggle with widening eyes.* "How did you-?"

Ridley: "One on one." *He wiped blood which ran from the corner of his mouth.*

Jewel: "..." *A dark spear suddenly shot up from the glyph and straight through her chest.*

Ridley: "Excellent-"

Teresa: "Jewel!"

Jewel: "Kak-" *She coughed out blood and fell to the ground.*

Teresa: *She frowned and focused her attention back to Ridley, tightening her grip around the Pentarang.* "I will make you pay for that!-"

Ridley: *He looked around in confusion and stared at Teresa puzzled.* "The illusion is still active? I know I struck the real Jewel, so why hasn't it ended?"

Teresa: "Her illusion was powerful-"

Ridley: "There have only been two number one captain ranking warriors who excel in illusion-based Remenistal and abilities, none of such with this power."

Teresa: "It is an illusion far surpassing your insignificant expectations, as it was supported by my Neurons." *She grunted in anger.*

Ridley: "I see." *He spoke in understanding, observing the desert-like terrain around him.* (So, I need to take down Teresa too-)

Teresa: "I have acquired the strength to topple even your power."

Ridley: *He glanced at Teresa in an annoyed manner.* "What are you talking about?"

Teresa: *Her eyes shined a beautiful golden colour.* "It will be a requirement to fight you with my entire potential."

Ridley: *He gasped, quickly noticing the distance between him and Teresa in a cautious manner.* "Your eyes, Tarlea's power.. It was in you this whole time."

Teresa: "..." *She stood in a powerful stance, as sand swirled around her.*

Ridley: *He chuckled.* "You've been jealous of the power of light for some time."

Teresa: "How would you know what I desire?"

Ridley: *He ignored Teresa's question.* "Ha ha, your mother gave you that power-"

Teresa: "Silence-"

Ridley: "That very power you chased after for so long-"

Teresa: "Silence at once!"

Ridley: "And, you couldn't even activate it-" *He chuckled, slightly covering his mouth.* "Because you had your emotions sealed." *His chuckle turned into laughter.* "What an ironic joke-"

Teresa: *Her eyes flashed gold and her image disappeared.* "Harh." *She appeared above Ridley, looking at him from a bird's eye view.*

Ridley: "Hmm-?"

Teresa: "Typhoon's Pulse." *She pointed down and an explosion of sand erupted around Ridley.*

Ridley: *He flashstepped out of the explosion and scraped his feet into the sand, as he continued to move backwards.* (Too bad for her, she was moments too late.)

Teresa: *Her image appeared directly in front of Ridley.* "Ougi."

Ridley: *His eyes widened as Teresa's hair flicked in his face.* (She's really going all out-)

Teresa: "Suffer in the incandescent plumes of my hatred for you, Bakana Flare."

Ridley: "NIGHTSHADE" *He grabbed Teresa with one hand and pointed the other in her face.* "Ha!"

*A strong blast of wind circled around Ridley and Teresa and an eruption of multi-coloured flames burnt Ridley from the feet up.*

Ridley: "Ker-Kerh-" *Before the flames consumed his body, a stream of black lightning struck Teresa in the face.*

Teresa: "Kargh-" *She awkwardly gagged with widening eyes, as the lightning struck through the back of her head.*

*Splinters of flames swirled around the multi-coloured eruption, as pulse-like blasts blew the sand back.*

Teresa: "Tcch-" *Her image appeared in the distance, watching the flames burn Ridley alive.* (Just a second later and that lightning would have made contact.)

Ridley: *He flashstepped in the distance behind the intensifying flames, hidden from Teresa's line of sight.* "M-My-" *He spoke under his breath, dropping to his knees in exhaustion.*

Teresa: *She felt a black vein-like burn mark on the side of her cheek, which travelled up to her eyebrow.* (That may scar-) "Tcch-" *She gritted her teeth and cautiously looked around.* (Despite a direct impact, I still sense his being-)

*The flames disappeared revealing Ridley on his knees.*

Ridley: *He stared at Teresa in the distance, hiding his exhaustion from her.* "You're incredibly fast, avoiding my Nightshade at such a close range."

Teresa: "Avoiding my Ougi at close range-" *She yelled in the distance, as if she didn't care what Ridley had to say.*

Ridley: "..."

Teresa: "No, surviving my Ougi at such a range is impressive."

Ridley: *He grunted in shock, as Teresa's voice came from behind.* "What-?" *He looked over his shoulder, noticing another copy of Teresa behind him.*

Teresa: *She smirked, watching blue flowers grow around Ridley.* "Flora Dasher."

Ridley: *He looked back in front, noticing Teresa in the distance.* (Two copies-)

Teresa: *She smirked, watching Ridley and her copy stand in the distance.* "Sacred blood throughout thy veins, I say heed thout command-"

*The flowers bloomed and suddenly shot out bullets of condensed sand without warning, violently hitting Ridley from every angle.*

Ridley: "Argh-" *The sound of a bone cracking caused him to wheeze and drop to his knees.*

Teresa: *She looked down at Ridley with a cold expression, watching him cough out blood.* "..."

Ridley: "Kah-" *He frowned with gritted teeth and flashstepped out of the barrage of pebbles, causing the copy of Teresa to disappear.*

Teresa: *She glanced to her side, noticing a trail-like stream of sand swirl into the distance.* (He still managed to flashstep out of the way?)

Ridley: *His image appeared far in the distance, sighing in relief.* (I won't be able to take much more damage-)

Teresa: *She stepped forward and her image disappeared, causing sand to erupt into the air.* "Running is useless."

Ridley: *He coughed with widening eyes and turned around to face Teresa, pretending he wasn't intimidated.* "Fighting me is useless-"

Teresa: "SOUTHERN CROSS" *She spoke with an echoing voice, watching golden lines draw themselves underneath her feet.*

Ridley: *He looked down to his feet, discreetly observing the expanding glyph in amazement.* (It's massive, it looks like a cross.)

*The glyphic cross formed circles and released bright light, resonating unusual sounds.*

Ridley: "No-" *Light burnt his arm, causing him to grunt in pain.* (The shadow is violently reacting to Teresa's Rostical!)

Teresa: "Time to finish this off..."

Ridley: *He frowned and yelled at the top of his lungs.* "Astragons at my command, no mercy for the damned, with all my might, DARK STRIKE" *He cupped his hands and punched the glyph, causing a black pulse to shatter the light.*

Teresa: "Hoh?" *She stepped back and avoided the dissipating darkness, watching Ridley stand up with a pant.*

Ridley: "H-How do you intend to finish this off?"

Teresa: *She dropped the Pentarang and formed fists with watering eyes.* "Why will you not die already?!"

Ridley: *He inhaled deeply and smirked, regaining his composure.* "I can't-"

Teresa: "I will finish this off by using my mother's Grand Rostical." *Tears ran down her cheeks.* "This is for you-"

*Teresa firmly spread her legs and cupped her hands, as the area turned to night.*

Ridley: "T-Teresa's Blossom!?"

*Teresa nodded her head, as visible balls of Neurons materialised in the air.*

Ridley: (Roharnia?!) *He thought in fear, knowing the power of Teresa's attack.*

Teresa: (The hardest part is creating the Reality Sekai.) *She began to concentrate, causing Ridley to step back in distress.*

Ridley: *The area lit up, as a ball of light floated past him.* "Do you think I'd let you use something like that?"

Teresa: "Do you feel the surges of power?" *She spoke with her eyes closed and smirked, as if she knew what Ridley was feeling.*

Ridley: (To think, she'd know that Remenistal-) *He shouted in thought and paused, quickly regaining his composure.* "Ougi."

----------

Alicia: "Please come to my aid and fight alongside me, Ice Dragoon." *A massive dragon-shaped ice sculpture stood next to her, as mist expelled from its mouth.*

Pickles: "That Scoldrant-like appearance, are you an Elementalist?"

Alicia: "No-"

Pickles: "No matter-" *A dragon's arm of ice erupted up from the ground and grabbed her around the neck.*

Alicia: "I think it does matter." *She whispered with an emotionless tone.*

Pickles: "Karh karh-" *She choked and glanced at the ice around her neck, raising her arm.* "..."

*A shard of ice erupted around Pickles' hand and shattered, taking form of a mallet.*

Pickles: "K-Karh-" *She smashed the mallet on the dragon's arm, causing the ice and mallet to shatter.*

Alicia: "My Ougi's ice is much stronger than before, it doesn't shatter easily-"

Pickles: "One is only as strong as one's weakness." *She flashstepped in front of Alicia and raised a scythe of ice behind her head.* "Harh!-"

*The ice dragon moved in front of Alicia and withstood Pickles' attack, causing the scythe to shatter.*

Pickles: *The force of hitting the hard ice caused her to stumble backwards in shock.* (I only cracked the ice!-)

Alicia: "..." *She stared at Pickles with an emotionless face, noticing a crack in the dragon's body.* (If that managed to crack the ice, she must've intended to kill me with that strike-)

Pickles: *She brushed shavings of ice off her hands, staring at Alicia in thought.* (If she isn't an Elementalist, what is with that Remenistal?!)

Alicia: "ICICLE EDGE" *She shuffled backwards and watched spears of different sizes fall towards Pickles.*

*A shield of ice burst up from the ground, landing itself into Pickles' hand.*

Pickles: "..." *She swayed to the side, throwing the shield upwards.*

Alicia: *She watched the spears of ice fracture on the shield, listening to glass-like shatters.* (Despite my new power, her ice matches mine-)

*The ice dragon quickly raised its arm with thickening ice and slammed it like a mallet on Pickles.*

Pickles: *She pushed herself forward and slid on a path made of ice at incredible speeds, barely avoiding the ice dragon's attack.* (That was close-)

Alicia: (She's using the ice to move... Like I did at Battling Oxident.)

Pickles: *She noticed a splash-like explosion of ice shards form along the ground around the dragon's arm.* (You wouldn't think that sculpture could move so fast.)

Alicia: *She unintentionally bit her bottom lip with an emotionless face.* "..."

Pickles: (I'll use the speed of my slide to land a critical on her.) *She slid towards Alicia, as a halberd made of ice shattered in her hand.*

Alicia: "GLACIA'S EDGE" *She spoke under her breath, watching pillars of ice erupt from the ground.*

Pickles: *She swayed to each side, avoiding the pillars of ice.* (They're random, it's hard to predict-)

Alicia: (I learnt to fight like this by watching Lance-)

Pickles: (That Neuron build up!-) *She gasped with widening eyes and jumped high into the air, as an ice pillar erupted up, smashing the path of ice she rode on.*

Alicia: (She's fast-)
Pickles: "Herh-" *She landed on the aura path and punched to the side, shattering the pillar of ice.*

Alicia: (She's fast, as well as strong-) *She flicked her fingers, causing more pillars to violently erupt around Pickles.*

Pickles: *She sidestepped barely avoiding one pillar and spun around, smashing the halberd into another pillar.* "Herh.." *She breathed in fatigue, as the ice shattered away from her.*

Alicia: "Ice Dragoon!"

*The ice dragon responded to Alicia's voice and quickly spun around, facing Pickles.*

Pickles: *She looked to her side at the ice sculpture.* "I won't let you get in my way-"

*The ice dragon's arms extended and suddenly shot towards Pickles, opening its claws.*

Pickles: *She watched its arms continue to extend, as it readied to grab her.* "Attacking me straight on will not work-"

*The ice dragon's tail erupted from the ground behind Pickles, wrapping itself around her neck.*

Pickles: "Kak-?!"

Alicia: (It has to be done-)

Pickles: *She struggled to breathe, as the tail lifted her up off her feet.* (No!-)

*The ice dragon rammed its claws into Pickles' chest, causing blood to stream down its icy fingers.*

Pickles: (Damn you-) *She frowned in thought and dropped the halberd, listening to it shatter on the ground.*

Alicia: "..." *She silently watched Pickles' feet dangle in the air and prepared to turn around.*

Pickles: (I learnt this technique from observing a natural plant in The Twilight Forest-) *She closed her eyes and wheezed, as a pulse shattered the surrounding ice around her.* "Argh-" *She dropped to her knees and inhaled deeply for air.*

Alicia: *She gasped and looked shocked.* "H-How?"

Pickles: *She stood up and brushed ice shavings off her legs, watching skin-coloured ice cover her wounds.* "A plant, it stores Neuron-like energy by the sun and it absorbs Astragons in the air."

Alicia: "A plant stores Neurons and absorbs Astragons?"

Pickles: "Very good at repeating what I said.. When prey are in striking distance, it puffs out the energy in one burst. Essentially anyone can possess this simple technique-"

Alicia: *She looked at the armless ice dragon and glanced back to Pickles.* (Help!)

*The ice dragon roared and breathed out a sudden burst of mist towards Pickles.*

Pickles: *She gasped and faced the dragon, staring at the gust of mist.* "I thought-" *Her head suddenly froze, as the mist blew past her.*

*The ice dragon roared and ice erupted from its body, reforming its arm.*

Pickles: *She punched the ice around her head, causing the thin layer of ice to shatter.* "Grr.." *She looked annoyed, ignoring distinctive red scratch marks around her neck.*

Alicia: (My Ougi can restore itself! And it doesn't even weaken me to use it, not like last time-)

Pickles: (This is annoying me.) *She spread both arms and ice erupted and shattered around her hands, revealing two long swords.*

Alicia: *She looked shocked and stepped forward.* "Ice Dragoon!"

Pickles: *She quickly inspected the ice dragon's structure, watching it raise its arm to attack.* "The weak spot is-" *She ran towards the ice sculpture and ducked under the dragon's slash-like scratch.*

*The ice dragoon opened its jaw and shot its shard-like teeth at Pickles.*

Pickles: *She grunted with widening eyes and twirled around, slicing the shards of ice with her long sword.* "Naice." *She whispered in an impressed manner, keeping her running speed towards the dragon.*

Alicia: *She cupped her hands and a blue glyph shined under her feet.* "POLAR SNAP"

Pickles: "Here-" *She ran into striking distance and jabbed the swords into one spot near its leg, causing its leg to crack like glass.*

Alicia: *She watched snow swirl and float around pickles.* "..."

*The ice dragon spun around, sweeping its tail along the ground.*

Pickles: *She jumped up ignoring the snow and smirked, watching the ice continue to crack along its leg.* "Nearly."

*An eruption of ice exploded from the side of the dragon and formed an arm, instantly jabbing towards Pickles.*

Pickles: "Wha-?" *She spiralled towards the ground and crossed the long swords in front of her, blocking the attack.*

*The ice dragon's third arm rattled, as it tried to break Pickles' swords.*

Pickles: (I have to use the pulse again!-) *She closed her eyes and opened them with widening determination.*

Alicia: *She watched the arm and long swords suddenly crack and shatter to the ground.* "..."

Pickles: *She landed on the ground with ease and stepped back, exhaling smoke-like mist.* (That was too close.)

Alicia: "Ice Dragoon!" *Her words caused the dragon to open its jaw and shoot out several ice shards.*

Pickles: *She quickly ducked and rolled behind a nearby ice pillar, avoiding the ice shards.* (They were fast-)

Alicia: "Bind her again with-" *The ice dragon completely shattered, which slightly rumbled the path.* "W-What?!"

Pickles: *She smirked, as she held a large spear made of ice in both hands.* "That was an impressive Ougi-" *She walked out from behind the ice pillar and pointed the spear at Alicia.*

Alicia: "H-How, what happened to it?"

Pickles: "The weakness with ice is similar to glass, once its integrity has weakened, the damage will spread throughout the entire structure. But, you know, I never thought of creating something like that with my ice, I only shape weapons-"

*A white speck of snow landed on Pickles' nose, causing her to look around in confusion.*

Pickles: "Where did this-?"

*The snow quickly clustered around Pickles and imploded into a star-shaped ice block around her.*

Alicia: (It seems Polar Snap has a very slow startup-)

Pickles: "Argh-" *She screamed and shattered the ice around her before falling to her knees.*

Alicia: *She looked to where the ice dragon was, glancing at the piles of ice left behind.* "..."

*Thunder rumbled from the darkening clouds and it started to rain heavily, causing Pickles to smirk.*

Pickles: "Time has worked against you." *She panted, watching puddles form on the path around her.*

Alicia: *She shook her head feeling vulnerable.* "No-"

*Sounds of scraping glass echoed from the puddles of water, catching Pickles' attention.*

Pickles: "Now-" *She swayed her arms to her side and sprinted towards Alicia.*

Alicia: "FREEZING HOLLOWS" *She took a deep breath and blew a sudden gust of mist towards Pickles.*

Pickles: "Ougi-" *A wall of ice rose several feet in front of her, repelling the mist.*

Alicia: "GLACIA'S-" *Swords of ice shot up from the ground, stabbing her through her shoulders.* "Argh!"

Pickles: *Swords of ice shot up around her and she caught them, failing to lose any speed.* "Harh!" *A sheet of ice curved up from the ground, causing her to slide up into the air.*

Alicia: *She bent forward in pain, watching ice violently spike around her feet.* (I can't do this, like how I am.)

*Alicia's eyes shined gold and she waved her arms, shattering all the ice around her.*

Alicia: (I've come here for a greater purpose, I won't let her stop me!) *She pushed herself forward and she slid across the path.*

Pickles: *Her green hair flapped behind her, as she looked at Alicia annoyed.* (I wasn't expecting her to break free, I was going to use a powerful aerial attack-)

Alicia: *Her hair and pendant flapped to each side.* (From what I've seen, this Rostical-based rain will have to eventually stop..)

*Alicia slid past a puddle, causing two small trail-like streams to freeze over.*

Alicia: (Maybe if I pass the time, her attack will run out of Neurons or Astragons?)

Pickles: *She held the sword at an angle and swayed her arms, causing curved spikes, spears, pillars, boulders of ice to blast around Alicia.*

Alicia: *She slid back and forth barely avoiding the array of icy objects which blasted around her.* (Argh-) *The top of an ice spear slashed her across the arm, as she slid past it.*

Pickles: (I can't get a hit! Her slide-like skid is troubling to keep up.) *She spun around and threw the swords downwards.* (But, she isn't the only one who rides along the ice!)

Alicia: *She slid in a curve-like motion, giving the illusion she ice skated.* "I know a plan-" *Two swords suddenly stabbed her in the leg and lower back, causing her to tumble across the path.*

Pickles: *She landed on the ice-covered ground and watched Alicia slide over chunks of ice face-first.* "About time." *She slowly inhaled and power-walked towards Alicia.*

Alicia: *She formed a fist and released it, shattering the ice from her leg and back.* "I-I-" *She coughed and moaned in pain, trying not to move.*

Pickles: *She stopped and hovered over Alicia, slowly exhaling smoke-like mist.* "Time is up."

*A thick spear grew from a nearby puddle and Pickles grabbed it with one hand, snapping it off.*

Alicia: (PKMY says, analysing what you've experienced and learning from that is vital to be an intelligent fighter...) *She whispered in thought and recalled her entire fight with Pickles.* "Before-"

*Alicia whimpered and rolled onto her back, staring at Pickles in a defeated manner.*

Pickles: "Please-" *She lowered the spear, as if she wanted to hear what Alicia had to say.* "You were like a fish trying to push back a glacier, you had no chance.."

Alicia: "Before I go, my strongest move, a combination of three elements! Water, light and ice!" *She pointed at Pickles and smirked, as if she won the battle.*

Pickles: *She gasped, stepping back with widening eyes.* "Ougi-"

Alicia: "HEALING RINGS"

Pickles: "Divinity Shard." *She quickly formed a square with her fingers and watched a wall of ice shoot up, flicking green hair over her shoulder with anticipation.* (At this close range, my Ougi won't completely repel her attack, but it should keep me safe.)

Alicia: *She closed her eyes as light illuminated around the ice, causing her to stand up.* (Is this.. What it feels like?)

Pickles: *She stared at the glowing light in an unimpressed manner, causing her to look to each side puzzled.* "For a strongest technique, only glowing light is rather disa-"

*Pickles cautiously looked around the ice and appeared surprised, staring at Alicia in confusion.*

Alicia: *She stood in a powerful appearing battle stance completely healed.* "I-It was a long shot, but that was my plan."

Pickles: (She's completely healed!) "No matter, the water is everywhere now." *She shook her head and smirked, watching water drip off her fringe.* "I can easily rack up the damage you just healed-"

Alicia: *She shook her head and flicked her hair backwards, spraying water over her shoulder.* "Not if I use my Grand Rostical first-"

*The glow from the path dimmed, as the area became pitch black.*

Pickles: "G-Grand Remenistal!" *She gasped and stepped back in a terrified manner.*

----------

*The five copies of Isaac stood in a clustered group, facing off Holland and PKMY.*

Isaac: "I think it's time we f-finish this-"

PKMY: "You finish this? Please, I have absolutely no idea how you got that idea-" *She paused and thought to herself.*

Isaac: "What i-idea?"

PKMY: "The idea that you're going to win." *She smirked and loudly sniffed, leaning to one side in confidence.*

Isaac: "W-What are you talking about?" *He spoke in disrespect and leant against another copy of himself.*

PKMY: "I guess, I was a little weary from my previous fights." *She cracked her neck and knuckles and flicked her wrist, causing the Ryukku to spin like a fan's blade.*

Holland: "Amy?"

PKMY: "Holly's strong too." *She walked up to him and smiled, nudging her head at Isaac.* "Let's walk all over this guy."

Holland: *He smirked, nodding his head with sudden confidence.* "Yeah, alright."

PKMY: "Alright-" *She glanced at Isaac, pointing the Ryukku at him.* "Wateva your name is, me and Holly are going to OHKO each one of you."

Freya: (OHKO?)

Holland: (One hit knock out.)

Isaac: "Ha ha ha, you're h-hilarious!"

PKMY: *She flashstepped in front of Isaac, as her body glowed a shade of blue.* "Sonic Drilldriver."

*PKMY flicked her wrist and watched the Ryukku spin like a fan's blade, before ramming it into Isaac's face.*

PKMY: "Heh-" *She smirked and listened to a saw-like noise, watching Isaac's head explode into rocks.*

Destiny: (Wow-) "Meeheehe." *She sneezed in amazement.*

Holland: *He held his throat, frowning in understanding.* "That's enough, thanks, everyone." *He clicked his fingers, causing Twotters, Fryfry and Destiny to disintegrate into the air.*

PKMY: *She smirked evil-like, watching three copies of Isaac jump away from her.* "Cowards!"

Isaac: *He stepped back in shock, watching his clone crumble to rubble.* "How-?"

PKMY: "Blast, I was hoping that was the real one."

Isaac: *He stood the closest to PKMY and looked angry, forming fists.* (The real one?)

*Isaac shouted in anger and punched the ground, causing a ring of spear-like rocks to erupt out of the ground around PKMY.*

Isaac: "Take th-this! Piercing Chain Land-"

Freya: *She swooped down at incredible speeds and hovered in front of Isaac, flapping her wings in his face.* "Growlith!"

PKMY: *She noticed Isaac focusing his attention to Freya, causing her to jump high into the air.* (Thanks, Freya.)

Freya: (Gargling Whirlpool.) *She leant back and barked out a vortex of water.*

Isaac: "Water alone won't work-"

Freya: "Blarh-" *She watched the vortex of water hit Isaac, pushing him back several feet.*

PKMY: *She stopped rising and looked down, slowly spinning towards the ground in a dive-like manner.* (I used this technique once on a defensive whip user, the dickhead's attack bounced right off due to my devastating spin and speed, heh.)

Isaac: *He crossed his arms and blocked the water, causing the ring of spear-like rocks to drop to the ground.* "Told you, water-"

PKMY: *She started to generate a swirl of wind around her, as she spiralled in a bullet-like manner.* "Raging Swirling Strike."

Isaac: *He lowered his arms and shook water off his hands, looking up in confusion.* "Huh?"

PKMY: *She spread her legs, causing her spiral movement to stop.* "Harh!"

*PKMY punched Isaac on top of the head, causing his entire body to shatter into pebbles.*

Freya: "Ruff!-" *She yelped in shock, staring at Isaac's shoe-like remains on the ground.*

*The force of PKMY's punch caused a shockwave to pulse around her, violently blowing grass and dirt back.*

Freya: "Grr-" *She suddenly blew back and leant forward, struggling to flap out of the force.*

PKMY: *She landed on the ground with ease and noticed Freya caught in the force's rip.* "..." *A green glyph shined under her feet.* "AIR SWIRL"

*A gust of wind sliced the air in front of Freya and stopped the force, allowing her to move.*

Freya: "Awhroo!" *She flapped her wings, flying high into the air.*

Holland: *He smiled at PKMY's efforts to help Freya.* "Two down, huh? I want a piece already!" *He shouted, punching his fists together in excitement.*

PKMY: "All yours, Holly-" *She flashstepped behind Holland, causing a pulse of dirt to swirl around her.* "But, if you take your time, I'll be back at full force."

Holland: *He smirked, standing on the spot in preparation.* "...-"

PKMY: "I might even have enough energy to punch you too-"

Holland: *PKMY's slight threat caused him to act.* "Freya! Ougi!"

Isaac: *He frowned, cautiously staring at PKMY and Holland.* (They took down two already!? They had the same power as me, the original!)

Freya: "Grr..." *Her growls deepened to a state of being intimidating and her body grew in size.*

Isaac: "You've got another thing coming if you think we're going to stand here and do nothing. All of us, focus on the one target!"

*The two copies of Isaac nodded their heads, flashstepping in a triangular pattern around Freya.*

Freya: "Greroalyth." *She lowered her head and gargled flames, glancing at the Isaacs around her.*

PKMY: *She smirked and pushed herself away from Holland, causing her to slide back along the ground.* "I haven't properly used this yet."

Holland: *He stepped back and noticed PKMY wasn't there, causing him to look over his shoulder.* (Amy? What's she doing?)

PKMY: "O' fiery spirits feel my power and awaken. Sacrificial glyphs form and spiral, open the gates to The Astral Plains-"

*An enormous red glyph drew itself on the ground around PKMY and glowed with a bright, fluorescent dark shadow.*

Freya: *She glared at the Isaac who stood in front of her.* "Ice Fang." *She opened her jaw and eight fluoro blue strings suddenly extended from her teeth, violently jabbing into Isaac.*

Isaac: *The strings hardened into ice and he struggled to move.* "This won't work-" *He yelled, causing boulders to erupt from the ground around him.*

Holland: (Finish him, Freya!)

Isaac: *He stamped the ground, causing two boulders to collide in a scissor-like motion in front of him, shattering the ice away.* "Ha ha harh-"

Freya: "Sonic Roar." *She roared out a visible shockwave, causing the ice, boulders and Isaac to explode backwards.*

Holland: (Good work!)

Isaac: (Another copy down!) *He gasped, shaking his head in disbelief.* "N-No-"

PKMY: "Show me, prove to me that the legends are true-" *She danced on the glyph, as spirals of unreadable text formed themselves in the air.*

Freya: *She growled in a deep croaky tone and looked behind her, glaring at another copy of Isaac.* "Gearrrr." *She sighed out a blast of flames, slowly looking away.*

Isaac: "Y-You th-think I-I'm s-sc-scared-?!"

Freya: "Flash Hound." *Her image disappeared and she reappeared next to Holland, discreetly withdrawing blood-covered nails.*

Holland: *He smiled and touched Freya's leg, looking up at her in a proud manner.* "Good work, that's enough."

Freya: "Ryes-" *Her body disintegrated into tiny white orbs, gently blowing Holland's hair to the side.*

Isaac: *He coughed and wheezed, awkwardly standing on the spot motionless.* "..."

Holland: "Huh?" *He looked up, focusing his attention on the motionless Isaac.*

Isaac: "W-When did-?"

Holland: (Why is he-?) *He watched the ground suddenly explode around Isaac, as his body sliced in half.* "Whoa!-"

Isaac: *He watched his other copy crumble to the ground.* (That Scoldrant, it must've slashed the rock copy while flashstepping past him!-)

Holland: (How did that happen-?)

Isaac: "W-Well, th-that's-s, n-nothing!" *He shouted with an angered stutter and faced Holland, hiding his fear.*

Holland: "I think we accidentally left the real one last?"

PKMY: "Dark flames cover the skies, rain down and bring forth your total destruction-" *She smirked, as several multi-layered glyphic rings materialised around her.*

Isaac: (Those symbols?!) *He looked past Holland, intensely staring at the spiralling glyphs around PKMY.* (That's one of the strongest forbidden Remenistal! I thought that was lost in the ages!-)

*PKMY stood up straight and raised her arms into the air, causing the glyphic rings to spiral high into the air.*

Holland: *He looked up, watching stars flicker in a space-like image inside the massive circular glyph.* "What technique is this, Amy?"

PKMY: "METEOR SWARM"

Isaac: "W-What, n-no!" *He stuttered with widening eyes, watching the area turn to darkness.*

Holland: *He grunted and stepped forward, as PKMY's glyph lit up the area with its red glow.* "I'm not letting you have the last hit, Hi-Ougi."

Isaac: (Now a Hi-Ougi?!) *He stuttered on the spot unsure what to do or say.* "..."

----------

Brazza: *He sniffed and smirked, staring at Nathan's motionless body.* "Boring-"

Lance: "Wat is your deal?!" *He stood up in anger and walked towards Brazza.* "I'll pick up the sword and kill you myself!"

Brazza: "Hehe." *He shook his head in a condescending manner.* "The sword? Who needs weapons when you're an Elementalist."

Lance: *He stopped, staring at Brazza in a cautious manner.* "Aye?"

Brazza: "This-" *He casually raised his hand and clicked his fingers, causing a red sword-like stream of lightning to spark in his hand.*

Lance: "So, I can do that with my sword?"

Brazza: "Remenistal can't be used in such a manner, only an Elementalist can use elements as weapons like this." *He smirked, as his armour flickered in the lightning's presence.*

Lance: "Why ya smirkin'?!" *He grunted with growing impatience.*

Brazza: "I can't believe your friend didn't know any Remenistal, and he tried to take me on."

Lance: *He noticed Brazza's injuries.* "You took a beatin' yourself!"

Brazza: *He stepped to the side and faced Lance, causing the lightning to flash away.* "Fine, you're next?"

*Brazza reached behind his back and twitched the axe, causing it to detach itself from the armour.*

Lance: (Unlike Nathan, I've got Rostickal up my sleeve.)

Brazza: "C'mon, if you're so eager to fight me, then bring it." *He shook his head as if Lance was an idiot.*

Lance: *His eye twitched.* "..." *He ran towards Brazza and raised his fists.*

Brazza: "Is this guy for serious? He doesn't have a weapon." *He spoke to himself in disbelief.*

Lance: "Yea, I'm serious-, and I'm right here-" *He frowned at Brazza, running into striking distance.*

Brazza: *He mentally lined the axe up with Lance, waiting for him to step into a closer range.*

Lance: (I'll use the force of my running speed and punch Brenda right in the face!) *He stopped moving his feet, causing him to slide across the ground towards Brazza.*

Brazza: "Wow, I'm afraid." *He raised the axe and struck it downwards.*

Lance: "Shi-" *He prematurely stopped himself and rolled to the side.*

Brazza: *The axe jabbed into the ground, blowing leaves into the air.* "You're a fast little guy, aren't you?"

Lance: *He jumped up and straightened his hand at Brazza.* "Yea, I am."

Brazza: *He looked at Lance's arm puzzled, as he pulled the axe out from the ground.* (I don't sense he's strong enough to use Remenistal-)

Lance: "LIGHTNING BLAST" *A stream of lightning instantly flashed in a ball and blasted towards Brazza.*

Brazza: *He stepped back in shock and used the axe to defend himself against the lightning.* (Crud, who is this guy?) *Metallic rattles came from the axe, as it glowed red.* "Arh, hot!-"

*Brazza grunted and dropped the axe, shaking his hand in pain.*

Lance: *He twitched his fingers, as the lightning scattered into nothing.* "Too hot to handle?" *He smiled at his joke, causing Brazza to roll his eyes.*

Brazza: "Yes? Obviously." *He cautiously picked up the axe and twirled it in his hand.*

Lance: *He rolled his eyes and glanced at his empty hands.* (Only an Elementalist, aye?) *He smirked, as blue lightning sparked around his arm.*

Brazza: "You know Remenistal." *He mumbled to himself in an impressed manner and smirked, waiting for the axe to cool down.*

Lance: *The blue lightning took shape of a sword.* "Ready."

Brazza: *He focused his attention to Lance and paused, pointing at the lightning in confusion.* "That's not possible?"

Lance: *He unintentionally ignored Brazza, as the blue stream of lightning broke its current and sparked to the sides, burning the leaves on the ground.* (Oops?)

Brazza: "Remenistal can't be manipulated like that, but you..?"

Lance: *He grunted and focused again, causing blue lightning to form into a sword in his hand.* (Wow, unlike Rostickal, where I gotta add an ongoing surge of Newgongs-)

*Lance mumbled in thought, swaying the lightning as if it was a futuristic weapon.*

Lance: (-I just have to pour power into the shape and that's it?)

Brazza: "But, you just used Remenistal so you can't be an Elementalist-"

Lance: "Dude, enough chat." *He slightly lowered the lightning sword, glaring at Brazza in a serious manner.*

Brazza: *He snapped out of his disbelief and looked annoyed, flicking his head to move his hair.* "Now I'm liking what you have to say." *He mumbled in a deep voice and stood in a battle-ready pose, raising the axe.*

Lance: *He raised the lightning sword, causing blue lights to flicker off his face.* (He's coming-)

Brazza: (I'll take down this loser and help whoever needs my help.) *He suddenly ran into striking distance and slammed the axe directly towards Lance's face.*

Lance: *He stepped back in a defensive manner, quickly lining the sword across his face.* "Argh!-"

Brazza: *He watched splinters of lightning spark around his axe, as Lance blocked the strike.* (Dang it.)

Lance: "Tssk, you're hell strong."

Brazza: *He showed struggle in his face, as he held the axe with both hands and pushed downwards.* "It won't budge."

Lance: *He bit his lips in struggle, trying to hit away the axe.* "Grrr-"

*The axe nudged closer to Lance's face, as the lightning cut into the axe.*

Brazza: *He looked shocked.* "These are mythril axes-"

Lance: (Too close for my comfort-) "THUNDER BOOM"

Brazza: *A strong rumble-like vibration caused him to let go of the axe which remained in the air attached to the lightning.* "Say what-?"

*A loud wave of thunder knocked Brazza off his feet, pulsing the leaves back.*

Lance: "Grr-" *He slashed the lightning through the axe, causing a strange metallic-like hum to resonate.* "Phew-"

*The axe snapped in half and fell to the ground.*

Brazza: *He touched the ground and slid back, trying to break out of the force.* "Hmph-"

*A string of red lightning swirled around Brazza's legs, causing him to suddenly stop.*

Brazza: (A sound-based attack? He's definitely using Remenistal. So-?) *He stared at the blue lightning in Lance's hand, watching its zigzag-like stream form the shape of a sword.*

Lance: (Despite recently pullin' this power outta my ass, it's so easy to get. It just, comes so naturally to me, aye.) *He swayed the lightning sword as if it was a wand, watching it light the area with its blue glow.*

Brazza: (How is he manipulating the lightning like that?)

Lance: (The lightning is weightless, and it cuts through mythril.) *He admired the lightning and looked at Brazza in a serious manner.*

Brazza: "Fine, let's see whose is stronger." *He clicked his fingers and two swords made of red lightning zapped in between his fingers.*

Lance: "Yea-" *He stared at Brazza's red lightning, pointing the sword at him.* "Bring it."

Brazza: "Hmph." *He smirked and jabbed the lightning forward, causing lightning to blast towards Lance.*

Lance: "H-Huh?! It extended!-" *He grunted in shock.* "MAGNETIC RUMBLE" *He raised his arm and an expanding white shield spiralled in front of him, causing the blue lightning to scatter.*

Brazza: *His arm suddenly twitched with resistance, as the lightning hit Lance's shield.* (What did it hit? Whatever it is, it's stronger than I thought-)

*The red lightning scattered away from Lance and flashed into nothing, causing Brazza to grunt with contemplation.*

Lance: *He lowered his arm, causing the glyph to disintegrate.* "You had me shocked when the swords extended into a stream of lightning, but, that was nothin', aye."

Brazza: *He rolled his eyes and face palmed, shaking his head.* "Who would've thought, that you knew defensive skills."

Lance: "Pssht." *He rolled his eyes and face palmed, pretending to be Brazza in a childish manner.*

Brazza: "Don't get too excited."

Lance: "Back atcha." *He smirked, as a yellow glyph glowed under his feet.* "Smear upon the skies-"

Brazza: (Remenistal, huh.)

Lance: "Blue waves crashing down-" *He straightened his arm at Brazza and a ball of light grew in his palm.*

Brazza: *He puffed out his chest and leant forward, straightening his arms.* "Take this-" *Red swirls of lightning flashed around his arms.*

Lance: "LIGHTNING BLAST"

Brazza: "Arh!"
Lance: "Harh!" *They pushed forward and blasted a stream of lightning at the same time, watching the steams violently collide into each other.*

Brazza: (Even-) *He mumbled in thought, noticing swirls of purple flames string in the middle of the lightning.*

Lance: *His hand twitched, as his yellow lightning slowly pushed forward against Brazza's red lightning.* (I've never compared lightning before, so this is a weird sensation-)

Brazza: *His arms wobbled and the leaves around him blew back.* (The force behind this guy's lightning is overwhelming-)

Lance: "Aha, my lightning too strong for ya?" *He yelled, watching his lightning consume seventy percent of the stream.*

Brazza: (Remenistal is stronger in my opinion, but that's not what makes us Elementalists great-) *He smirked and twitched his fingers with anticipation.*

Lance: "Why smile? I'm winnin'!-" *He paused with a fading smile, noticing Brazza's lightning warp and slither in a fluid manner.*

Brazza: (It's the manipulation!-)

Lance: "Wat?" *He unknowingly mumbled to himself, as a large burst of purple flames ringed around the lightning.* (I can actually feel the change in his lightning!-)

Brazza: "Here!" *He pushed forward.*

*A pulse knocked Lance's lightning slightly back, causing him to look at the lightning in confusion.*

Lance: "Why is your lightning warpy instead of zigzaggy-?"

Brazza: "..." *His lightning suddenly blasted forward and swirled around Lance's like a snake.*

Lance: *His face lit up, as Brazza's lightning continued to swirl around his lightning directly towards him.* "Shit-" *He stepped to the side, causing his lightning to separate and disintegrate into the air.*

Brazza: (He broke the stream? What a fool-)

Lance: "Smear upon the skies and envelop your might, thunder roar down-" *He watched the red lightning swirl past him with widening eyes.*

Brazza: "You're gone." *He flicked his wrist, causing the fluid-like stream of lightning to bend towards Lance.*

Lance: "LIGHTNING PULSE" *He clapped his hands in front and a ring of blue lightning rumbled like thunder.*

*The stream of red lightning hit Lance's blue ring of lightning, causing small bursts of purple lightning to scatter the air.*

Brazza: *He watched his lightning string around his arms in a recoiled manner as Lance's blue lightning withstood his attack.* (It won't budge!)

Lance: (Brenda's lightning is so strong, I can't even push this ring forward-)

Brazza: "Tch, whatevs." *He clicked his fingers, causing his lightning to flash away.*

Lance: *His lightning sparked away, giving him time to take a deep breath.* (Damn...-) *He looked at his hands in confusion, watching sweat drip down his face.*

Brazza: *He cautiously stared at Lance, taking the opportunity to think of what happened.* (I've fought several lightning-based Remenistal Users, but this guy has a force that neither I or them had.)

Lance: (I got a strange feelin' every time I used my Lightning Blast... That doesn't mean..?) *He touched his throat with widening eyes, causing him to smirk in understanding.*

Brazza: *He noticed Lance's new body posture, causing him to raise his arms.* (Looks like thinking time is over-)

Lance: "LIGHTNING BLAST" *He pushed forward, blasting a stream of yellow lightning at Brazza.*

Brazza: *He swayed to the side, causing three streams of red lightning to scatter in front, blocking the attack.* "Hmph-"

Lance: *He started to run in a large circle around Brazza and straightened his arm, blasting another stream of lightning at him.* "LIGHTNING BLAST"

Brazza: "Hmph." *He flashstepped to the side, avoiding the stream of lightning.*

Lance: *He stopped and enthusiastically leant forward, blasting another stream of lightning directly towards Brazza.* "LIGHTNING BLAST"

Brazza: "Jolt Cage." *He spread his arms and stood in a red cage of lightning, watching it withstand Lance's attack.*

Lance: "Damn-" *He lowered his arm and frowned with concentration, straightening his arm again.*

Brazza: *He folded his arms and stared at Lance, safely standing behind his cage of red lightning with a confident smirk.* "Give it up-"

Lance: "Smear upon the skies, blue waves crashing down, LIGHTNING BLAST" *He pushed forward, blasting a thick stream of bright yellow lightning at Brazza.*

Brazza: *He watched the lightning violently hit his cage of red lightning, noticing bright purple flames splinter past his face.* (Whoa-)

Lance: (No effect-) *He lowered his arm, causing the lightning to spark away.*

Brazza: "That last attack had more juice, but you're still a far cry from ever reaching my lightning."

Lance: *He gritted his teeth, staring at the lightning in an annoyed manner.* (Still?!)

Brazza: "Hehe-" *He spread his arms, staring at the cage of red lightning with a happy smile.*

Lance: *He touched his throat again, readying himself.* (I got it! The words!-) "Flash of the storm, smear upon the skies-"

Brazza: (Flash of the storm?)

Lance: *He watched five streams of fluoro yellow lightning swirl into a ball around his hand.* "Blue waves crashing down, chain reaction-"

Brazza: *He grunted with widening eyes, taking a step back.* (That power? I've never felt it before-)

Lance: "LIGHTNING CHAIN BLAST"

Brazza: "Chain?! Wha-?!"

Lance: "Hah." *He pushed forward, blasting five streams of warped lightning at Brazza.*

Brazza: *He clapped his hands and tightened them, readying for Lance's attack to spark into striking distance.* (I will use a sonic pulse to-)

Lance: *His arm lowered by itself which broke the stream.* "Huh?" *He watched the lightning warp and stream around Brazza.*

Brazza: *He watched two streams of fluoro yellow lightning hit his cage, causing it to instantly zap away.* "My cage?! How-?"

*A stream of lightning swooped over Brazza, burning several floating leaves into yellow flames.*

Lance: (My lightning is movin' on its own?)

Brazza: (What is this lightning? It moves like an Elementalists' but powered like a Remenistal Users'-)

Lance: (Lightning Chain Blast?) *He looked at his hand, smirking in amazement.*

Brazza: "Spark Cannon." *He spoke in a deep voice and swayed to the side, blasting five red balls of lightning at a moving stream of lightning.* (Gotcha-)

*Brazza smirked, watching the balls of lightning hit the stream, causing them both to scatter and flash into nothing.*

Lance: (What an awesome Rostickal!)

Brazza: *He noticed a nearby stream of lightning swirl towards him, causing him to quickly flashstep several feet away.* (The lightning seems to be following my Neuron signature-)

*Brazza frowned and swayed his wrist, flicking a swirl of lightning at the stream, causing them to scatter and flash into nothing.*

Brazza: (Last one-) "Resonating Clash." *He punched above his head and quickly punched downwards, releasing a serenity-sounding thunder to echo in a pulse.*

Lance: *He covered his ears, watching the lightning pulse and scatter away in shock.* "Aye?"

Brazza: *He took a deep breath and slowly regained his composure, staring at Lance in curiosity.* "What are you?"

Lance: "Aha-" *He lowered his arms and looked at his nails in a cocky manner.* "Looks like my lightning is pretty good."

Brazza: "Hmph, arrogant much?"

Lance: "It's not like I haven't heard that before." *He stuck out his tongue and smirked.*

Brazza: "Disrespectful.." *He grunted on his breath, frowning at Lance's attitude.* "Ougi."

Lance: "Oh yea? Owgee." (This guy is fast, so I better use my other variants-) "Cloud-nine Volt."

Brazza: *He pointed both arms in the air.* "Supreme Strobe Light Storm." *Lightning as thick as trees struck down around him.*

Lance: *A thick blast of lightning hit the ground next to him, causing him to lean away.* "Whoa-" *The lightning pulsed into the ground, causing the ground to explode and the leaves to burn.*

Brazza: (My lightning is fearful, but when the Rasticsplash kicks in, it's terrifying.)

Lance: *He stared at the leaves with widening eyes.* "S-Shit nuggets-"

Brazza: "Heh, kinda glad to see that arrogant face of yours disappear like that."

Lance: "Tssk-" *He squinted his eyes in concentration, as fog wafted into a wall in front of him.*

Brazza: (The lightning in my Ougi has killed several of my opponents in one strike alone-) *He stood still, as more lightning strikes struck down in random places.*

Lance: (Why isn't lightning shootin' out yet-?) *Lightning sparked in the fog, causing him to smirk.* "'Bout time-"

*Lance pushed both arms forward and a barrage of lightning bolts flared out of the fog towards Brazza.*

Brazza: *He noticed the barrage of lightning bolts.* "W-Whoa-" *He waved his arms down and a thick stream of lightning blasted down in front of him.*

*Lance and Brazza's lightning made contact, causing an instant explosion of bright red flames to blast around the lightning.*

Brazza: *The force of the explosion knocked him high into the air and into the trees.* "Argh-" *He flew through the branches and felt the leaves brush past him, watching his arms and legs sway in the air.*

Lance: (I ain't one of them people in the movies-) *He watched the bright red flames extinguish, cueing him to sway his arms to control the fog.* (-No way I'll just stand there and let the enemy plot or recover-)

*The sounds of snapping tree branches and rustling leaves could be heard, as Brazza fell onto the ground.*

Brazza: *He landed on his stomach, grunting in pain.* "Our lightning-" *He spoke on a grunt, holding his chest in pain.*

Lance: *He paused momentarily, causing the fog to waft in a motionless-like manner.* "..."

Brazza: "Our lightning must've been of opposite magnitude, for an explosion to instantly occur like that."

Lance: "Zero-volt Blender." *He stepped to the side and motioned the fog forward, watching it swirl towards Brazza.*

Brazza: *He coughed out smoke and leant up.* "That was a shock-"

Lance: "Harh!" *He angrily motioned downwards, causing the fog to crash on top of Brazza.*

Brazza: "Argh!" *Blue lightning scattered like veins along the ground, causing a circle of flames to ignite around him.*

Nathan: (I promise!) *He shouted in thought and slowly regained consciousness with a cough, noticing the leaves on fire.* "H-Huh? What's going on?" *He rubbed his head in pain, quickly wiping tears from his eyes.*

*Nathan listened to the sounds of muffled thunder, causing him to notice the electrified grey fog crashing on top of Brazza.*

Nathan: (What is that?!) *He watched leaves rustle off their branches, noticing they ignited into flames.* (That mist is burning the leaves before they make contact with it-?)

Lance: *He held his hands out and pouted with all his concentration, continuing to crash the electrified fog on top of Brazza.* "..."

Nathan: *He watched blue strings of lightning spark in the fog.* (Blue lightning-)

Lance: (Not yet-) *A bead of sweat ran down in between his eyes as it followed the growing wrinkles in his face.*

Nathan: (That man, Lance.. He's controlling this? Is this Rostical?)

Brazza: *His hair rapidly flapped and some singed into ash, as he was forced on his back.* "Grrrerh-" *He frowned in pain as red lightning was stopping the fog from fully collapsing onto him.*

Nathan: (He possessed this power? Then why didn't he use it against me!?) *He gasped in thought and looked slightly insulted while staring at the vein-like lightning in shock.*

Lance: *He lowered his arms and looked down as if the battle was finished.* (That's it..)

*The fog slowly stopped moving, lightening its current-like pressure on Brazza.*

Brazza: "Gah-" *His grunts of struggle came from the fading stream of fog.*

Lance: *He looked back to Brazza and watched the fog waft away, leaving no traces of lightning.* (Looks like Brendza's lightnin' stopped too-)

Brazza: "Mist? With lightning-?" *He grunted in respect as he lay motionless on the ground.*

Nathan: *He looked to his side and noticed The Sword of Memories lying on the ground next to him.* (He didn't use the sword?)

Lance: *He sniffed and wiped the sweat from his forehead.* "Bah-.."

Nathan: "Y-You did it?" *He sounded shocked and picked up the sword, standing up with a grunt.*

Lance: *He took a deep breath and shook his wrists, looking at his fingertips with a smirk.* "Wow, using lightning doesn't burn or tingle my fingers anymore. An Elementalist." *He sounded happy and slowly walked over to Brazza, listening to the leaves crunch under his feet.*

Nathan: (Did he say Elementalist?)

Brazza: "You won..." *He mumbled in a deep voice, taking the opportunity to catch his breath.* "You're as strong as a number one."

Lance: *He stopped next to Brazza and looked shocked.* (Number one?)

Nathan: *He swayed the sword to his side, walking over to Lance.* "How did you beat him?"

Lance: "I learnt different ways of usin' my Owgee."

Nathan: (Like how I learned to incorporate my Azure Bursts..)

Brazza: *He nodded his head in respect, slightly smirking at Lance.* "Finish me."

Lance: *He looked down to Brazza with a serious face.* "..."

Nathan: *He glanced at Lance.* (His eyes, he has no intention of killing him.)

Brazza: "Anyone?"

Nathan: *He focused back to Brazza.* (When I fought him, I didn't feel the blood-thirst hostility I usually do when fighting a warrior. Lance must have picked that up too.) "No-"

Brazza: "Don't give me that-"

Lance: "Nah, you were a respectable opponent to fight, aye. Someone who didn't use cheap tricks-"

Brazza: "This is an insult, just end me already."

Nathan: *He completely ignored Brazza and sighed.* (What he said-)

Brazza: "At least you won't be boring."
Lance: "You're doin' this outta boredom?"
Brazza: "Yes." *The conversation played in Nathan's mind.*

Nathan: "There's something you said that bothered me."

Brazza: *He twitched his fingers and moved his legs, trying to regain feeling in them.* "What...?"

Nathan: "You say, you do this out of boredom?"

Brazza: "Yeah." *He mumbled and stood up carefully, looking at Nathan and Lance with a tired expression on his face.*

Nathan: "Why?"

Brazza: "Nothing excites me anymore besides risking my life, so fighting keeps me alive."

Nathan: "There are stronger opponents out there, explore, satisfy your boredom in other ways."

Brazza: *He unintentionally rolled his eyes as if he didn't want to hear it.* "..."

Lance: "Ya know what seems borin' to me? Waitin' to get killed in a fight. With your power, I'd be like spendin' my time, shootin' lightning bolts across valleys, pshh pshh pshh-"

*Lance poked the air to each side, causing Nathan to look at him strangely.*

Nathan: (He's like Luna and Lezard but combined-)
Lance: "And, don't forget the thunder to scare some people, aha." *He clapped his hands, shrugging his shoulders.* "I dunno, aye."

Brazza: *He smiled, wiping dry blood off his face.* "I might just do that."

Nathan: *He tapped the sword on his leg, catching Brazza's attention.* "I also wouldn't mind a rematch, when I get used to this sword."

Brazza: "You know-" *He looked down and smirked at the burnt leaves on the ground.* "For someone who can't use Remenistal or even command the elements, you were a worthy and respectable fighter."

Nathan: *He smirked, nodding his head in appreciation.* "When I clashed blades with you, I didn't feel any evil intent in your actions."

Brazza: "Hey, I just say how it is, I was bored." *He shrugged his shoulders and rocked his head, flicking hair out of his face.*

Lance: *He smirked in a mature-like manner, presenting his hand to Brazza.* "Thanks."

Brazza: *He looked down at Lance's hand in confusion.* "Thanks for what?"

Lance: "Teachin' me how to use my Elementalist powers. I couldn't really find a good use for it since I had a diverse lightning Rostickal roster already."

Brazza: "I didn't teach you anything, though."

Lance: *He closed his eyes, smirking like a child.* "Wateva."

Brazza: "So, you're a hybrid." *He grunted in a deep voice, trying to comprehend the idea.*

Lance: *He opened his eyes and looked serious.* "Yea, it seems so."

Brazza: (That would explain a lot of things-) "No problamo." *He shook Lance's hand in a manly manner.* "Also, you having the same affinity, I wouldn't mind helping you out, since you didn't kill me."

Nathan: "I don't think he was going to kill you-"

Lance: "Shut it, Natalie. Let him gimme some of this help." *He spoke with anticipation, smirking in a childish manner.*

Nathan: *He smiled slightly and turned around, admiring the sword in his hand.* (Does this mean he's giving me the sword even though I blacked out...?)

*Nathan paused and stared at his reflection in the beautifully crafted sword, noticing his face reflect his negative thoughts.*

Nathan: (Bella.. I haven't forgotten about you.)
Brazza: *He focused his attention on the handshake and closed his eyes, tightening his grip.* "..."

Lance: "Wat has tightenin' my hand got to-?"

Brazza: *Red lightning streamed from his hand and swirled up to Lance's shoulder.* "Our abilities are similar to our distance cousins."

Lance: *He watched the lightning swirl into his arm, glancing at Brazza with a dropping jaw in confusion.* "Wat..?"

Brazza: "It's an ability to help family members with the same affinity..." *He mumbled and let go of Lance's hand, stepping back.* "There, you've got my Ougi now."

Lance: (What?) *He looked at his hand and formed a fist with a widening smile.* "Thanks?"

Nathan: *He stopped his line of thought and focused on Lance and Brazza's conversation.* (He's got an Ougi? Just like that? I don't understand how that would work-?)

Lance: "So, I can like, call a lightning storm 'n' stuff now?" *He spoke in excitement, as if he was going to abuse the power.*

Brazza: "You need to be careful with lightning."

Lance: "Aye?"

Brazza: (Back in my training days-..) *He shook his head as if he had no time to explain.*

Lance: "Brendza?"

Brazza: "Here-" *He spoke in a deep voice, presenting a blue crystal to Lance.*

Lance: "Wat's this?"

Brazza: "A captain classed warrior that doesn't know what a Crystalline Blossom is?" *He spoke in a confused, playful-like manner and focused, causing a red dye to fill the crystal.*

Lance: "Aye? The Crystalline Blossom is now red?"

Brazza: "Actually, it's a Crystalline Membrane now."

Lance: "Aye-?" *He grabbed the crystal in confusion, slightly shaking his head.*

Brazza: "Just pour Neurons into it when you're ready."

Lance: "Umm, OK?" *He slowly reached behind, causing the crystal to disappear.* "Wat's on it?"

Brazza: "I'm off, catchya."

Lance: "Wait, when should I look at it?"

Brazza: "..."

Lance: "Well, do you know where the Consultant-?"

Brazza: "Shush." *He suddenly flashstepped out of the forest, blowing a spiral of leaves into the air.*

Nathan: (He's able to flashstep after fighting both of us-)

-

Brazza: (Failing to kill them.. This means I've officially betrayed the Consultant.) *He mumbled in thought as things moved past him in slow motion.*

-

Nathan: *He looked at the sword.* (It doesn't feel like I've earned this sword.)

Lance: "Oh.." *He sighed in accomplishment and turned around, glancing at Nathan's back.*

Nathan: (He won the fight and he never used that level of Rostical against me..)

Lance: "So, lemme guess, a teleportation glyph outta here?"

Nathan: "Yes-" *He quickly turned around and faced Lance, sighing with an emotional face.*

Lance: "Whoa, settle down-"

Nathan: "I took the time to think about this, and-" *He frowned with hesitation, presenting the sword in both hands.* "I want you to have this-"

Lance: *He awed at the sword with a dropping jaw, slowly reaching out.* "Well-"

Nathan: (I want to complete our goal all with my own efforts.) "Take it!"

Lance: *He gently grabbed the handle, raising the sword in amazement.* "Wat changed ya mind?"

Nathan: *He looked down, staring at the ash left by the leaves.* "You defeated the opponent I failed to do so."

Lance: *He had flashbacks of using the lightning sword.* "No-"

Nathan: "Don't insult and disrespect me! I'm giving up ownership of the sword-"

Lance: "Nah-"

Nathan: "Huh?" *His determined anger faded to confusion.*

Lance: "First Brendza and now you, shove this respect thing up your ass."

Nathan: "Up my arse?" *He looked and sounded disgusted.*

Lance: "I don't need a solid weapon anymore, I've got my lightning now." *He shoved the sword against Nathan's chest and stepped back, symbolising he didn't want it.*

Nathan: "Solid?" *He held the sword in his arms, looking at Lance in confusion.* (Does that mean he really didn't use it in his fight?)

Lance: "Look-" *He clicked his fingers and blue lightning took shape of a sword in his hand.*

Nathan: *He stared at the lightning in a dumbfounded manner, glancing at Lance in shock.* (Moves similar to Luna's bow-) "Where did you-?"

Lance: "With my fight against Brendza." *He swayed his arm, causing the lightning to scatter and flash into nothing.*

Nathan: "But.. This is The Sword of Memories-"

Lance: "Pssht, who cares. I got ma lightning of I'm gonna zap the shit outta ya memories."

Nathan: *He paused, staring at Lance with an emotionless face.* "That's not a weapon?"

Lance: "Gah-" *He face palmed, slightly shaking his head.*

Nathan: "Either way, I still can't accept-"

Lance: "Yea, ya can."

Nathan: "But you defeated the opponent-"

Lance: "Now, let's get outta here." *He ignorantly ignored Nathan, glancing to each side for an exit.*

Nathan: *He paused and smiled with gratitude.* "I guess, I would be a better owner to wield such a weapon."

Lance: *He rolled his eyes and walked past Nathan.* "Wateva."

Nathan: "Thank you." *He mumbled in appreciation, as he pulled out a stone from a small leather sack around his belt.*

Lance: (You're welcome..) *He sniffed his finger, pretending not to care.*

Nathan: (I think that solidifies my theory of him acting immature and not being immature.) *He tightened his grip on the stone, causing a purple glyph to draw itself on the ground.* "Dawn's teleportation glyphs don't take long to activate, be ready."

Lance: "Where to?"

Nathan: "Sakura Village." *He looked at the glyph, sheathing the sword into a cover which stretched to fit its size.*

Lance: "Right." *He nodded his head, watching the glyph glow purple.*

Nathan: "Like I said, her glyphs don't take long, be sure to get on." *He walked onto the glyph and stepped to the side, looking at Lance.*

Lance: "Wateva."

Nathan: (He wanted this sword and now he gives it up so eagerly?) *He placed a hand on the sword and disappeared in a flash of purple light.* (I guess the same thing could be said about me?)

Lance: *He slowly inhaled and stepped towards the glowing glyph.* (Nathan can't use Rostickal.. He was kinda nothing without that weapon against Brendza.)

*Birds flew above the treetops and chirped, causing Lance to look up in thought.*

Lance: (Why keep something if you don't need it? Another saying of Ashton's I never understood until now.) *He chuckled at himself and stepped on the glyph, instantly disappearing in a flash of purple light.*

*Nathan watched the area blur and swirl around him, causing him to squint his eyes.*

Nathan: (I'll master this sword-) *He reached over his shoulder, causing the sword to turn invisible.*

----------

Joy: "What took you so long?"

Cameron: "I calculated Lupton was still too weak to battle, so I sent him to Silver Wind Island-"

Dakota: "Excuse me! I'm still here!" *The water around her whooshed, as a powerful current circulated around her.* "I am number one-"

Cameron: *He looked at Dakota with a bored expression.* "Knowing your title is helpful. I will not be incredibly shocked this time." *He had glimpses of Teresa's emotionless face.*

Dakota: "This time?"

Cameron: "Never mind-"

Dakota: "Who are you? You're wearing a warrior's armour."

Cameron: "That does not concern you."

*Joy and Chrisma ran towards each other and held hands, as Dakota focused all her attention to Cameron.*

Joy: "We'll watch from a safe distance." *She firmly held Chrisma's hand and started to run away.*

Chrisma: "Get in-" *She groaned under her breath and glanced over her shoulder, watching Dakota intensely stare at Cameron.* "She's powerful."

Joy: "So is Cameron."

Dakota: "Does not concern me? Unforgivable! Who do you think you are? You're not a captain!-"

Cameron: "I am not a captain?"

Dakota: "I heard all captain classed warriors have been exterminated from the rankings."

Cameron: *He reached over his shoulder and grabbed onto something.* "I see." *He flashstepped directly in front of Dakota.*

Dakota: "You can flashstep!-"

Cameron: *He formed a fist with his left hand, while keeping a grip behind his back.* "Thank you for pointing out the obvious-"

*Cameron punched the water on Dakota's chest, causing a vortex of water to blast behind her back.*

Dakota: *She gasped with widening eyes, watching bubbles violently swirl in her water-like armour.* "You're stronger than I thought-"

Cameron: "Your water shield is stronger than I thought-" *He pulled his arm forward and sparks scattered from a blue sword with glyphic symbols engraved on it.*

Dakota: "A sword?"

Cameron: "Really?" *He spoke with an emotionless tone.*

Dakota: "Condescending, unforgiv-" *Cameron's image vanished, causing her jaw to drop with shock.* "Where-?"

Chrisma: (He's gone!) *She gasped in thought, quickly looking around puzzled.*

Joy: (Just like Terra, I can't pinpoint where he-)

Chrisma: "U-Up there!" *She pointed up in the air in amazement, revealing Cameron's position.*

Dakota: *She puffed her lips and smirked, slowly looking up in a casual manner.* "..."

Cameron: (How troublesome. I was going to end the fight just now-) *He held the sword with one hand and clicked his fingers, causing a blue glyph to spiral in front of him.*

Dakota: *She whipped her tentacles and readied to attack Cameron in the air.* "Bring it!-"

Cameron: "ICICLE EDGE" *He swayed his hand down and blasted a thick spear of ice at Dakota, instantaneously freezing her right tentacle.*

*The spear hit the ground and rumbled in an explosion of ice, freezing the dirt around Dakota.*

Chrisma: "Oh, get in!" *She groaned on her breath in amazement, causing Joy to look at her strangely.*

Dakota: *She awkwardly held her right arm out, watching mist evaporate off the ice in shock.* "Scrah!" *She screamed, causing the ice to shatter in a pulse of water.*

Cameron: "How annoying-" *He flashstepped on the ground next to Dakota, causing a wave of dirt, ice and water to swirl around him.*

Dakota: *She looked in the corner of her eye, glaring at Cameron with a dropping jaw.* (I can't react-)

Cameron: "Take this." *He spiralled around and slashed the area across Dakota's arm, watching water sprinkle around his sword with a smirk.* "Too slow."

Chrisma: (He didn't even touch her!-)

Dakota: "Grr-" *She flicked her arm, causing the tentacle to whip towards Cameron.*

Cameron: *He flashstepped moments before the tentacle hit the ground.* "Hermm."

Joy: (Amazing speed! It looked like she hit him from this angle!)

Cameron: "..." *He lowered the sword to his side, causing Dakota to frown in disgust.*

Dakota: "How dare you taunt me!"

Cameron: *He looked away with a serious facial expression.* "..."

Dakota: *Red water covered her vision.* "What?!" *She looked to her side and noticed her arm had been sliced off.*

Chrisma: (Wow! He did get her after all-)

Dakota: "What you did is unforgivable!-"

Cameron: *He pointed the blue sword at Dakota, causing her to stop in suspense.* "As number one, I took the time to mix my Ougi and Grand Remenistal into one powerful attack."

Chrisma: *She stared at Cameron, awkwardly tugging on her robes.* "He's amazing." *She lustfully moaned out loud, causing Joy to give her another strange look.*

Dakota: *She flicked her body to the side, causing her arm and contaminated water to splash on to the ground next to her.* "Did you say number one?" *She disrespectfully sounded condescending.*

Cameron: "Indeed." *He ran his finger along the engraved markings on his sword, as if Dakota wasn't a problem.*

Joy: *She looked down and stared at Dakota's arm, which was covered in red water.* (He sliced her arm and she doesn't show any signs of pain. His sword must be very sharp or he has excellent sword skills.)

Dakota: "Why don't you tell me about this combined Ougi and Grand Remenistal?"

Cameron: "Of course."

Dakota: "..." (He seems like a talker, I'll gather all my Neurons and focus on a groundbreaking critical hit, and end him with one hit.)

*Dakota frowned in disgust and focused, causing her water-made armour to swirl with a current.*

Dakota: (If what he says is true, as an ex-warrior, this attitude of his is unforgivable!)

Cameron: "My Ougi extends this blade's length and allows me to warp its structure. Very powerful in itself."

Dakota: *She sucked her bottom lip in concentration, as her hair swayed in the current.* (Need a little more time-) "And your Grand Remenistal?"

Cameron: "My Grand Remenistal is wind-based, merely powerful air pockets with a sharpened gust due to the precision of Astragons. Together, the combinations allow me to use a force-"

Dakota: "Blabber blabber blah-"

Cameron: "Herm?"

Dakota: *She laughed and flashstepped above Cameron, giggling in an evil-like manner.* "Ethereal Rapids."

Cameron: *He looked up and appeared without worry.* "Ougi, Grand Remenistal-"

Chrisma: (Ethereal Rapids? That sounds familiar.) *She watched the area turn into night, noticing all sounds become mute.* (I can't hear any of the outside noises.)

Dakota: "Harh!" *The sounds of rumbling water could be heard in the distance.*

Cameron: *He dropped his sword, which suddenly shattered before it hit his feet.* "A Storm of Swords, AIRBORNE RAZOR"

Joy: *She wisely observed the battle from a safe distance with Chrisma.* (Their power levels are enormous-)

Chrisma: "I'm a little scared, Joy."

Joy: "..."

Chrisma: "What if he doesn't win?"

Joy: "At their level... Essentially, whoever gets to hit first, may win the fight-"

Cameron: "Let the steel storm begin-" *He looked to his side, watching a sword materialise in the air next to him.*

Dakota: *She stood on the air, watching the water around her become fluoro in colour.* "Huh?"

Cameron: "..." *He nudged his head, causing the sword to violently shoot towards Dakota with an extending blade.*

Dakota: "What did you say?!"

*The sword pierced through the air with an echoing screech, violently stabbing Dakota in the shoulder.*

Cameron: "It does not matter-" *Blood and water ran down the sword before it shattered into nothing.*

Dakota: "Gah-" *She bent forward in pain, holding her stomach in shock.* (I couldn't even see that sword!)

Chrisma: *She felt the vibrations along the ground, causing her to notice the fluoro white water rumbling towards Cameron.* "The water's going to get my man! MYSTIC SHI-"

Joy: *She placed her hand on Chrisma's shoulder, causing her to stop.* "One of the unwritten conditions of Ougi, Hi-Ougi and Grand Remenistal, is the fact no one else can chant or attack in the darkness-"

Chrisma: "So, he's defenceless?"

Joy: *She shook her head for clarification.* "This Ougi was not meant for us."

Chrisma: "Oh?"

Cameron: *He looked up and faced Dakota, shooting a materialising blade in his hand.* "Enjoy the eye of the storm-"

Dakota: *She focused her attention on the blade and hit it with her tentacle, causing a long stream of sparks to scatter off the blade.* (I can't hit it away!-)

Cameron: "Humph-"

Dakota: *She leant at an angle and spurted the water to one side, blasting herself to the ground.* "Grr, unforgivable-"

Cameron: *He twisted his wrist, causing the blade to unnaturally curve and spiral down towards Dakota.* "Keep focused, captain."

Dakota: *She quickly looked up with gritted teeth and flashstepped several feet to the side, causing a trail-like stream of water to follow her.* "It bends-?!"

*Dakota shouted under her breath and watched the sword hit the ground, violently exploding it upon impact.*

Cameron: *He focused his attention on Dakota, squinting his eyes in concentration.* (She will eventually step into my storm's fury-)

Dakota: (I was too excited readying to kill this warrior with my final attack, I didn't realise he was doing the same-) *She growled like an animal, watching a wave of water swirl around her body.*

*Five blue sword blades quickly extended out of the ground, violently stabbing Dakota through the legs.*

Dakota: "Argh-" *She screamed in pain, as the water tentacles supported her body.*

Cameron: *He ran in a large circle out of striking distance, as several more blades materialised around Dakota.* "Slice! Harr!"

Dakota: "Grarh!" *She swayed her arms around her body and whipped the tentacles, causing slash-like sparks to scatter off the surrounding swords.*

Cameron: (Impressive-)

Dakota: *She watched the blades snap in half, freeing her.* "Damn you, unforgivable!-" *She quickly rolled to the side and slid on her water tentacles, avoiding several shooting blades.*

Cameron: *He quickly flicked his hand at Dakota, causing three blades to spiral downwards.* "..."

Dakota: "..." *She looked up and slithered around the blades which closely stabbed into the ground around her.*

Cameron: *He waved his arm upwards, causing eight blades to curve towards Dakota from behind.* "..."

Dakota: *She quickly spun around on her leg-like tentacles and swayed to the side, causing a massive wave to crash on top of the blades.* "Grrr!"

Cameron: *He enthusiastically opened his hands, causing blades to extend out of the ground around Dakota.* "Done.."

*The blades violently and suddenly pierced through Dakota's body at different angles, causing her to whimper with a dropping jaw.*

Dakota: "Heerh?!" *She wheezed, causing several penetrated blades to rattle from her back.*

Cameron: *He listened to the rumbling water, drawing his attention towards it.* "I need the final blades to materialise-"

Dakota: *She coughed out blood which floated in her water-made armour.* "Too late, it's in striking distance-"

Cameron: *He jumped high into the air, avoiding a string of white fluoro water.* (Close-)

Dakota: "Now it's my turn!" *She screamed while gargling blood, motioning her arms towards Cameron.*

Cameron: *He watched several eruptions of water swirl towards him.* (The water's power and trajectory moves in a similar manner to my swords-)

*Cameron suddenly flashstepped on the ground, causing a pulse of water to swirl around him.*

Joy: (Fast!)

Cameron: (My final attack is drawing near-)

*A swirl of water with immense pressure, swooshed Cameron off his feet.*

Dakota: "Hahaha, unforgivable!" *She screamed out blood, as she watched Cameron tumble in the current.* "Drown, you self-titled number one!"

Chrisma: (He's in the water!-) *She gasped in thought, staring at the water with widening eyes.*

Cameron: *Bubbles swirled around him, as he spiralled and flipped in the violent current.* (This is bad-)

Dakota: "Drown! Hahaha-" *She paused with a smile on her face, as sixty swords materialised around her.*

Joy: *She silently looked around with amazement.* (I've been told that materialisation of solid objects is the strongest level of manipulation. This man.. These amount of swords... Extraordinary.)

Cameron: *The water smashed him against the ground, causing his ribs to crack.* (Solid? The floor-?) *He coughed out differently-sized bubbles, as a string of red liquid swirled out of his mouth.*

Dakota: "Being crushed by tones of water... This won't be the end, you'll drown before-"

*The swords suddenly stabbed her in every direction, causing the area to revert back to normal.*

Cameron: *He noticed two swords pierced through her head, causing him to smile before closing his eyes.* (Direct hit...)

Chrisma: *She watched the water drain into the ground, causing her to notice Dakota's motionless body.* "Huh?!"

Joy: "You don't have to look, Chrisma-"

Chrisma: *She stared at the swords pierced in Dakota's body, causing her to cover her mouth and eyes in disgust.* "Bless the Astragons." (I was focused on the water, I didn't notice her body-)

Cameron: *He flopped on the ground saturated in a pool of water, lying motionless on his back.* "..."

Joy: "Oh dear, he's not breathing!-"

Dakota: *The swords disintegrated and her body twitched with life.* "Karh!" *She inhaled deeply and coughed out blood, looking around surprised.*

Joy: *She intensely glared at Dakota with a surprised expression.* (She was stabbed through the head!)

Chrisma: "J-Joy..." *She stepped back in terror, awkwardly pointing at Dakota.* "H-How-?"

Dakota: *She wheezed and coughed, as the water faintly swirled around her body.* "This water instantly purifies damages I receive. In addition to this, this water is salt-"

Joy: "What an impossible ability to have!"

Chrisma: "Joy?"

Dakota: "Hehe... Mwuahaha, unforgivable!" *She hissed under her breath and slowly stood up, whipping a tentacle to the side.*

Joy: *She held Chrisma's hand and looked worried.* (Not even Cameron could defeat her.. What chance do we stand?)

Dakota: *She looked to the ground and noticed her arm, causing her to bend down and pick it up.* "That is why I am favoured by the Consultant. He recognised my ability and took me under his wing."

Joy: *She glanced at Cameron, who lay motionless.* (I can't heal him when she's around.)

Dakota: *She focused all her attention to her arm and watched the water swirl around it, as it began to reattach itself.* (I couldn't take the time to do this when he was still alive.)

*Joy and Chrisma both heard a noise and suddenly looked to the forest with shocked faces.*

Dakota: "You two aren't a threat, you wouldn't even be able to break through this water!" *She raised her arm with all her concentration, watching the skin reattach itself.*

Joy: "Who-?" *She whispered under her breath, watching a man run from the forest directly towards Dakota.*

Dakota: (It won't be hard to restore the blood flow through my arm-)

?????: "Ougi."

Dakota: *The man's presence startled her, causing her to look down in shock.* "Y-You again? I thought you fled like a coward into the forest."

Tyler: *He shook his head, throwing his hands into the RPG bag.* "Mastered state of Alchemy and Crafting I show you, Ragnarok."

Dakota: "You possess no Neurons or Astragons, like a mere peasant of a backwater vill-"

Tyler: *He threw both hands into the air and a puddle of white liquid splashed above him.* "I can do this!" *The water swirled around his arms and hands, as it took shape of a bazooka.*

Dakota: *She raised her arm in confusion, causing the water tentacle to whip in the air.* "What kind of weapon is-?"

Tyler: *He clipped the trigger in a shotgun-like motion and the sounds of the bazooka charged up.* "You can underestimate my strength, but not my intelligence-"

Dakota: "What kind of weapon makes those sounds-?"

Tyler: "It took the highest level of my intelligence to craft this-" *A fluoro green ball shot out of the bazooka and exploded in front of Dakota.*

Dakota: *A pulse of water erupted in front and behind her, causing her to gag with widening eyes.* "..."

Joy: "How-?"
Chrisma: "What-?!"

Tyler: *The bazooka made a laser-like sound, as it began to charge up.* "..."

Dakota: *She looked down to her stomach and silently opened her mouth in shock and disbelief.* "Gah, niyah-" *She wheezed in terror, as she stared at a visible hole in her chest.*

Tyler: "I-I'm sorry." *He stuttered in fear, as he clipped the trigger and aimed for her head.*

Dakota: "U-Unforgivable." *Her silver hair with blue streaks washed down her face, as the water-made armour lost its current and splashed to the ground.*

Tyler: "SURREAL PULSAR"

*A fluoro green ball shot at Dakota's head, causing a splatter of white orbs to float from the debris of her head.*

Tyler: "..." *He sighed and lowered the bazooka, watching it liquefy into nothing.*

Joy: *She covered her mouth in shock, watching the white orbs float high into the air.* "T-T-Tyler?" *She gasped in disbelief, watching him stand on the spot motionless.*

Chrisma: *She quickly ran towards Cameron, swaying her arms in an urgent manner.* "Ougi, HEALING RINGS"

Tyler: "..." *He looked up and stared at the swirl of white orbs drifting through the wind.*

Joy: "Ougi?" *She looked to the side, watching Chrisma hover over Cameron.*

Chrisma: *She cupped her hands and sung, causing the light in the area to slightly dim.* (Please don't be too late.) *Symbols appeared around her body and small rings glowed under Cameron.*

Cameron: *The rings spiralled around his chest, causing him to violently and painfully cough out water.* "Kar-ough." *He automatically rolled to his side and coughed out more water.*

Chrisma: *She smiled in relief and stepped back, sighing in a relaxed manner.* "Phew-"

Cameron: "Th-Thank you." *He wheezed while speaking in a professional manner.*

Tyler: *Cameron's coughs caused him to snap out of his daydream-like stare.* "Oh...?" *He turned around, resting an arm over his RPG bag.*

Joy: "I'm overwhelmed with what just happened." *She cautiously approached Chrisma and Cameron, as if she was still under threat.*

Tyler: *He silently walked towards Chrisma and Cameron, nodding his head in response.* "..."

Cameron: *He leant up and stared at the light, placing an arm over his knee.* "I wasn't expecting that."

Chrisma: "She survived your attack."

Cameron: *He coughed in shock as if he didn't remember.* "That was not possible, I watched a sword pierce her-"

Joy: "Despite such a lethal attack, let's not dwell on the information right now-" *She glanced at each party member, focusing her attention back to Cameron.* "Let's use this time to recover and recollect ourselves."

Tyler: "..." *He stood next to Joy, silently nodding his head in agreement.*

Cameron: "And despite such words of wisdom, we must take action-"

Chrisma: "Please stay still." *She focused on the white rings, which continued to spiral around Cameron.*

Cameron: "..."

Joy: "Excuse me, allow me to help." *She shuffled next to Chrisma and held her hands out, causing the light of the rings to brighten.*

Cameron: *He closed his eyes, taking a deep breath.* (This Remenistal, the light, it make it easier to breathe.)

----------

*Teresa and Ridley intensely glared at each other, ignoring a wave of sand which blew past them.*

Teresa: "This Ougi is said to instantly kill, no matter who the opponent is-"

Ridley: (I must stop her from using that technique-) "Daathic Nightwing."

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She frowned at Ridley, watching shadows move like flames around him.*

Ridley: (Summoning Astragons from The Astral Plains is not an easy thing to do, that's why my Ougi has only been used three times-)

Teresa: *The orbs around her whirled and sprinkled into the ground.* (Her exact words-)

Ridley: *He focused, causing the shadows to form themselves into a dark, skeletal-like creature.* (At this rate, it won't have enough time to materialise-)

Teresa: *She stared at Ridley with all her concentration, causing her hair to float on their sides, as if there was no gravity.* (That creature he is summoning, what an abomination.)

*The dark creature's bones cracked and extended, forming bone-like wings.*

Ridley: "Her Ougi or your Grand Remenistal-" *He suddenly floated off the ground and into the air with clusters of sand, causing him to look down in confusion.* "Wha-?"

Teresa: "Do not fret, my Grand Rostical distorts the Astragons by bending the space-" *She tapped her toe and slightly floated up.* "Gravity has not been affected, but the space has."

*A human-sized flower petal grew up from the ground, causing Ridley to discreetly gasp in terror.*

Ridley: (This is not looking good-)

Darkwing: "Skree!" *It screeched in distress and twitched as if it was stuck.*

Ridley: (The lack of gravity has halted my Ougi's manifestation!)

Teresa: *She stared at the flower bud in front of her.* "Flora filled with pure Neurons, use the nectar and form a divinity spectre, as one with nature and as one with power! I'll show you the power of top tier and what it takes, to become the level of a prodigy-"

Ridley: "No!" *He mumbled to himself and kicked his legs, trying to touch the ground.*

Teresa: "Humph-"

*The flower blossomed into a massive white rose with teal shadowing around the petals.*

Ridley: *He instantly stopped moving and crossed his arms in a defensive manner.* "This, you're a true prodigy-"

Teresa: "TERESA'S BLOSSOM"

*White glitter sparkled around the flower and its petals floated off the bud, drifting into the air.*

Ridley: "You're consumed with emotion, why not think this through-?"

Teresa: "No, I was foolish! I must apologise to Lance, Alicia, Amy-... Everyone."

Ridley: "Because you couldn't understand their emotion?"

Teresa: "Precisely." *She pushed forward and the petals sliced past Ridley at blinding speeds.*

Ridley: *The gravity and lighting returned to normal, as he dropped onto the sand.* "..."

Teresa: *She sighed in relief, elegantly landing on the sand.* "You were indeed a powerful enemy, but, I fail to see how you had not already been defeated, up until now, of course."

*Teresa scanned the desert-like area and noticed Jewel lying motionless on the ground.*

Teresa: "Jewel-" *She whispered to herself in concern, taking a step forward.*

Ridley: *He twitched his arms and leant up, as blood ran down his nose, ears, eyes and mouth.* "..."

Teresa: *She gasped in shock and disbelief, watching Ridley awkwardly stand on his feet.* "I-Inconceivable!"

Ridley: *He moaned in a dizzy-like state.* "It felt like blades-" *He bent forward and two sets of radiant wings erupted from his back, causing pieces of his garments to tear off his back.*

Teresa: *Her eyes widened, as a pulse of sand spiralled underneath Ridley.* "H-How?"

Ridley: "I won't lie to you-" *He floated into the air.* "You would have ended my quest right here and now if I hadn't unlocked my potential."

Teresa: "H-How-?" (That Grand Rostical exhausted almost, if not all of my Neurons. I can not fight any longer!)

Ridley: *His left eye shined gold and his right glowed black.* "This power is exactly what I desired." *One of his radiant white wings shined a fluoro black, as the other remained white.*

Teresa: "How-?"

Ridley: "This is the end, farewell, Teresa Seraph." *He raised his hands, as a white and black aura healed his wounds.*

Teresa: *She gasped in disbelief, shaking her head in a vulnerable-like manner.* "This power, this is not possible."

Ridley: "I know-" *He pushed his hand forward and a sudden burst of black and white beams spiralled towards Teresa.*

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She raised her hands, readying to block the beams.*

Ridley: *He gently floated down to the sand, looking at his hand in amazement.* "I'm curious to know what's happening myself? Perhaps the shadow and light have finally mixed together?"

Teresa: *Her hair rapidly blew back and her face lit up.* (This magnitude of power!-)

Ridley: "And a direct hit-"

*An explosion of darkness enveloped by white swirls caused the ground to shake like an earthquake.*

Ridley: "Well, that's what it feels like to be in an illusion." *His wings disintegrated as soon as his feet touched the ground.* "I didn't like it at all."

*The sounds of Teresa's screams echoed from the fading colours of black and white light.*

Ridley: "..." *He turned around and started to walk into a random direction, as if he no longer cared about Teresa.*

Teresa: "I am sorry, mother.." *She whispered with emotion, collapsing face-first into the sand.*

Ridley: *He closed his eyes, rubbing his cheek in thought.* (Her Neurons, I never would've thought I'd be the one to feel them disappear.)

Teresa: "I failed you-" *Her eyes rolled back, as she sighed out her last breath.*

Ridley: *He watched the area revert back into the cave, causing him to smirk in a victorious manner.* (I'm very weak... This confrontation has set me back, four to five hours.)

*Ridley looked over his shoulder and sighed in a satisfied manner, before focusing his attention back in front.*

Ridley: "Fair well, ladies." *His footsteps echoed, as he made his way outside the cave.*

*Teresa and Jewel lay motionless in their own pools of blood.*

----------

Alicia: "Please excuse if this isn't strong. I've only recently learnt the words for my Grand Rostical."

Pickles: *She stood in confusion, exhaling smoke-like mist.* "You've never released your Grand Remenistal?"

Alicia: "Th-That's right."

Pickles: "I don't know much about it, but every technique should automatically be used at least once when learned-"

Alicia: "This is very unlike me to interrupt, but this is a must-" *She closed her eyes and a bright blue glyph shined under her feet.* "PIERCING POWDER SNOW"

*Alicia spread her arms and the ground froze into a thick layer of ice.*

Pickles: *She tapped her feet on the ice, sighing out mist in an unimpressed manner.* "You froze the ground? So what?"

Alicia: *Pillars of ice exploded in a line on both sides of the path.* "This frozen fortress-"

*The pillars curved and connected above, causing the ice to form a fortress around them.*

Pickles: *She glanced at the surrounding ice with blue lips.* (Not even I can create this much ice in such a short amount of time, and I'm an Elementalist! Maybe if I could unlock how to use my Elemental Rage.)

Alicia: *She casually clicked her fingers, causing walls of ice to explode behind her and Pickles.* "Now, neither of us can leave."

*The frozen fortress blocked the sounds of the outside and everything echoed.*

Alicia: *She looked outside the ice fortress, watching water run down the sides.* "..."

Pickles: *She flicked green hair out of her face and over her head.* "What is this called again?"

Alicia: "Ougi, come to my aid and fight alongside me, Ice Dragoon."

*Nine ice dragons erupted from nearby ice pillars and they promptly circled around Pickles.*

Pickles: (Nine?!) *She spun around in shock, trying to hide her sudden and growing fear.* "How-?"

Alicia: *She appeared directly in front of Pickles, as ice exploded around her feet.* "..." *Her hair and pendant flicked forward, as if she came to a sudden halt.*

Pickles: "You know how to flashstep?"

Alicia: "... I'm in a hurry, I've made the choice."

Pickles: *She shook her head in confusion.* "Choice-?"

*Three ice dragons roared and reached out with extended arms, grabbing onto Pickles' arms.*

Pickles: "Grah-" *She screamed in pain, as the dragons stuck their claws into her body.*

*A snowy gust of wind spiralled around Alicia and Pickles and grew in power, acting like a blizzard.*

Pickles: *She squinted her eyes, as a spear made of ice erupted in her hands.* (It's like I'm outside Eon City!-)

Alicia: *She noticed the spear and flicked her head, causing two ice dragons to open their jaws in response.* "..."

Pickles: "This won't hold me-"

Alicia: "Unarm her." *She watched the ice dragons violently bite into Pickles' wrists, causing her to drop the ice spear in pain.*

Pickles: *Her hands twitched, as blood ran down her arm and down the ice dragons' head.* (I can't feel my arm-) *She tried to move, causing the three dragons to apply more pressure.*

Alicia: *She stared at Pickles with an emotionless face, ignoring the growing blizzard around her.* "..."

Pickles: "Grr!-" *The ice rattled around her, as it responded to her distress.*

Alicia: "Blizzard, inhale the burning fury to fight-" *She watched the snow's movement change in response to her voice.*

Pickles: *She glared at Alicia, spitting out a cube of frozen blood.* (Damn you-)

*A tornado-like blizzard tightly howled around Pickles, causing her skin to freeze and burn.*

Pickles: (It hurts!-)

Alicia: "This is over-" *She turned around, causing the surrounding ice to crack and shatter.*

Pickles: *The blizzard suddenly died down, leaving her hair frozen.* "M-My skin..."

*Sparkles of light shimmered off the spiralling shards of ice in the air.*

Pickles: "Wait-" *The spiralling shards of ice violently imploded on to Pickles, blowing a pulse of mist across the path.*

Alicia: *She raised her arm and slowly tightened her hand, causing a glass-like crumbling sound to echo.* (Tighten-)

*The ice around Pickles condensed into a large thick pillar, trapping her inside.*

Alicia: *She exhaled in sorrow and pouted with an emotionless face, slowly walking up the path towards Valhalla.* (Celest, I will see you now-)

*Alicia ignored the fragile sounds of the ice breaking, as the frozen fortress slowly shattered part by part.*

Pickles: *She made a croak-like sound, as she inhaled for air.* "Harh... Harh... Harh..." *She awkwardly stood on the spot and dropped to her knees, as chunks of ice fell off her body.*

Alicia: *She grunted in an annoyed manner, as a purple glyph drew itself under her feet.* "Why didn't it work?" *A purple light flashed and she stepped off a glyph right next to Pickles.*

Pickles: "T-Teleportation?" *She panted and looked at the ground, noticing Alicia's feet.* "I-I have an ice affinity."

Alicia: *She nodded her head in agreement and raised her arm with killing intent.* "Okay, ICICLE EDG-"

Pickles: "What is this choice?! You are not the person I was told about."

Alicia: *Pickles' words caused emotion to fill her eyes.* "I've been given the choice, to be selfish and keep what makes me happy, or, to make others happy."

Pickles: "Is that it?" *She grunted and fell face-first onto the path.*

Alicia: *She stared at Pickles' beautiful green hair, which lay along the path.* "You have no idea-"

Pickles: "No, I don't."

Alicia: *She slightly frowned in an annoyed manner.* "Then why talk about the choice?!"

Pickles: "At least, you were given a choice."

Alicia: "H-Huh?" *She lowered her arm in a curious manner, as if she wanted to hear what Pickles had to say.*

Pickles: "I wasn't given a choice on what I wanted."

Alicia: "What do you mean?"

Pickles: "The Consultant told me what was expected of me and how to do it." *Her words were slightly muffled, due to speaking to the ground.* "If I was given the choice, I'd choose the choice that would make me happy."

Alicia: "And that would be?"

Pickles: "To let me go on my own adventure, to explore the world. Not this meaningless fighting, fighting where I have no desire to be part of.."

Alicia: (Where is this rage of mine coming from?)

Pickles: *She coughed and twitched as if she could not move.* "Some of us felt like slaves to him, blinded by orders and a pretence of love, as if we were stray attention seeking dogs.. Bound by Remenistal or obligations, whatever the reason, we owed him our lives."

Alicia: (The choice that makes you happy?) *She stepped away from Pickles, cupping her pendant with widening eyes.*

*Sounds of scratching glass could be heard, as the last remaining ice disintegrated into nothing.*

Pickles: *She moaned in pain, causing Alicia to whimper with hesitation.* "Please, make it quick."

Alicia: "W-What have I become..?" *She covered her mouth in disgust and turned around.* (What have I become?!)

*Alicia closed her eyes, causing a tear to run down her face.*

Pickles: *She closed her eyes, twitching with anticipation.* "When you're ready-"

Alicia: "HEALING RINGS"

Pickles: *She had a vague flashback of Alicia using Healing Rings, causing her to open her eyes in confusion.* "What-?"

Alicia: *She suddenly ran up the path, shaking her head at herself.* (Some people aren't even given choices.. I thought I was making the right decision, but I can still heal people even if I choose for myself.)

Pickles: *White rings healed her cuts and cured the blue coloured skin she had on her arms and face.* "W-Why did you heal-?"

*Pickles slowly lifted her head, placing her hands on the path with growing energy.*

Pickles: "She's gone?" *She looked up the path and whimpered, trying to stand on her feet.*

Alicia: *She ran onto grass and looked across Valhalla, wiping tears off her face.* (I've made up my mind. The decision I should've made in the first place. My original decision.)

----------

Isaac: *He looked up to the sky, as the area around him was pitch black.* (Meteor Swarm?) *He grunted in thought, watching twinkles of red light flicker in the sky.*

PKMY: "Heh." *She stood straight and motioned downwards, causing spark-like rain to flash into the ground.*

Isaac: "Huh-?" *He looked down, watching smoke stream out of small bullet-like holes in the ground.*

Holland: "What was-?"

*A fireball shot down at blinding speeds, exploding into bright red flames upon impact.*

PKMY: *Her hair violently blew back, as she watched the flames expand with a widening smile.* "Haha heh."

Isaac: *He noticed the entire area light up, drawing his attention to the mass flickering lights above.* "Are they all meteors?"

*Another massive meteor-like fireball hit the ground, causing an enormous pulse to crack into the ground.*

Holland: *The ground violently shook under his feet, causing him to lose balance.* "Whoa!-"

Isaac: *His eyes widened and shined red, as he intensely stared at the flames.* "Th-This Remenistal!-"

*A wave of fireballs smashed into the ground at amazing speeds, causing the ground to crack around Isaac.*

Isaac: "Ground Shaking." *He punched to the side, causing a wall of differently-shaped pillars of rock to block the swirl of bright flames.*

*A small fireball hit the wall of pillars, instantly exploding them past Isaac's face.*

Isaac: *He gasped with widening eyes and quickly punched the air above his head with both hands, causing a volcanic-like eruption of sand to explode in between him and the flames.* "Dust Storm."

*Isaac stepped back, watching the flames consume the swirling eruption of sand.*

Isaac: (Ground is meant to be strong against flames!-)

PKMY: *She noticed several fireballs hit the eruption of sand, watching it explode into clumps of lava-like strings.* "Heh-"

Holland: *He covered his face, squinting his eyes in shock.* (This level of heat is similar to the phoenix I encountered with Sebastian and Blake!-)

Isaac: "Argh!" *He screamed into the air, watching bright flames scorch the area around him.*

Holland: (I can only hear him-) *He looked over his shoulder, noticing the glyphic spirals around PKMY.* "Amy?"

PKMY: "Not done yet-"

*Another swarm of meteors hit the ground around Isaac, violently exploding into multiple eruptions of flames.*

PKMY: "Heh, yahoo!" *She shouted in amazement and noticed the red glyphs in the air fade, causing the area to revert back to normal.*

Holland: *He slowly lowered his arm, watching smoke waft into the air from the ground.* (There's no way someone could've survived-)

Isaac: "You dirty!-..." *He grunted with an echoing pant, kneeling inside a greenstone prism.*

*Isaac stood up, causing the prism to crumble into a pulse of green coloured dust.*

PKMY: "Wat?" *She spoke under her breath, staring at Isaac in disbelief.* (He survived-)

Isaac: *All his hair was burnt off and he coughed out smoke.* "You! Dirty lamp!" *His cheeks were red and black as the fire had badly burnt his face.* "I-I'm going to get r-revenge-"

Holland: *He jumped forward, coughing in a confident manner.* "Did you forget about me?"

Isaac: "You can d-die too!" *He grunted in rage, watching his armour crumble off his body.*

Holland: "Hi-Ougi." *He shouted with an echoing voice and threw three pearls into the air, watching Destiny spiral out of a forming glyph.* "Winds howl and swirl with your might-"

Destiny: *She spiralled into the air and enthusiastically flapped her wings, blowing a strong tornado-like gale around Isaac.* "Meeheeehee!"

Isaac: "Huh?" *He stepped back and looked to each side, noticing the winds swirl around him.*

PKMY: *She watched Isaac become airborne, causing her to smirk.* (That's my Holly.)

Holland: "Flashes come before me and slice-"

*Destiny disintegrated and Fryfry materialised around Isaac, causing him to gasp in shock.*

Isaac: (Where did these Scoldrants come from-?!)

*Fryfry became bright and flew at high speeds, causing lines of light to slash Isaac.*

Isaac: "Gah-" *He coughed out blood and frowned in anger, watching the fireflies disintegrate into the air.*

Holland: *Twotters materialised in the air above Holland, catching Isaac's attention.* "Sound waves erupt the ground and explode-"

*Twotters released a high-frequency screech, causing the ground to explode underneath Isaac.*

Freya: (I know what to do.) *She jumped out of an expanding purple glyph which spiralled in front of Holland's chest.*

Holland: "Follow by your epic down-ward waves of fire-"

*Freya leapt high above the tornado and look down to Isaac, as fire swirled and formed into wings.*

PKMY: *She looked up with a dropping jaw.* (Wings of fire?! Freya! Awesome-)

Freya: "Growlith!" *She flapped down, causing a volcanic-like eruption to blast downwards.*

Isaac: *His arms and legs shattered off like rock.* "Harh." *He moaned under his breath, noticing his skin crumble off his face.*

Holland: "SUMMONCE COMBO" *Freya dived down and elegantly landed in between Holland and PKMY, blowing a pulse of dirt from her fire-based wings.*

*The fire tornado extinguished into splinters of flames, leaving Isaac high in the air.*

Isaac: "...-" *He spiralled down and landed heavily on the shards of rocks on the ground, causing a pot-like shatter to be heard.* "Argh-"

PKMY: (He's strong if he was able to survive those two attacks right after each other.) *She leant on one side and folded her arms, staring at Isaac's motionless body.*

Isaac: "I-I-I-I-I, won't g-give up!" *He grunted in anger as he gasped into consciousness.*

PKMY: (He doesn't even have arms or legs...)

Holland: "How-?"

Isaac: "Brazza might have the most dangerous affinity, Pickles might have the most intelligence, Dakota might have the best ability, but, I'm the sturdiest killing machine."

Holland: *He sighed, looking at PKMY as if he didn't know what to do.* "What can we do?"

PKMY: *She smirked and walked up to Holland, rubbing his arm.* "I've been wanting to do this for some time."

Holland: "Do what?"

PKMY: "Heh-" *She closed her eyes and her whispers echoed in Holland's head.*

Holland: *He smirked in response, biting his bottom lip in a curious manner.* "I'd like to give it a shot."

PKMY: "Now?"

Holland: "Yeah-"

Isaac: "You two don't have time to blabber-" *Rocks crumbled from the ground and connected to his body, slowly reforming his arms and legs.*

PKMY and Holland: "Hi-Ougi." *Freya wagged her tail and disintegrated into white orbs.*

Isaac: "..." *He leant up with a recovering body and paused, staring at Holland and PKMY in a defeated manner.*

*PKMY and Holland punched fists together, causing small red glyphic rings to spiral around their arms.*

PKMY: "With the power of my Rostical-"

Isaac: *He watched the light in the area fade, causing him to grit his teeth in desperation.* (It's become dark again!-)

Holland: "And the power of my summon-"

PKMY and Holland: "We command thee to bring forth your total destruction-"

*Aurora lights waved and swirled in the sky.*

PKMY and Holland: "SCELDRANT'S COMET"

Isaac: *He looked up and closed his eyes, as if he knew he couldn't survive the attack.* (Blast them-)

*An enormous comet enveloped with aurora light plummeted from the sky and crashed into Isaac.*

PKMY: "Yahoo-" *A force caused by the comet blasted her off her feet.*

Holland: "Amy!-" *The force pushed him back, causing him to tumble backwards.*

*The forceful wind suddenly died down, as the area reverted back to normal.*

PKMY: "Tssk-" *She spiralled in the air and landed perfectly on her feet.*

Isaac: "K-Kakk-k..." *He sighed under his breath and closed his eyes, suddenly pulsing into a wave of sand.*

Holland: *He sat on the ground and watched the sand blow away, before looking behind him to PKMY.* "Phew."

PKMY: "Wow." *She gasped in amazement, hiding her exhaustion.*

Holland: *He stood up and took a deep breath, brushing dirt from the back of his head.* "Not bad."

PKMY: "That was awesome, Holly."

Holland: *He sniffed and scratched the side of his cheek, smiling in a proud manner.* "Because it was us-"

*A purple glyph drew itself on the ground, causing PKMY and Holland to become alert.*

PKMY: "Dunno about you, but I'm up for more."

Holland: "Yeah." *He nodded his head and stared at the glyph with anticipation, standing in a battle-ready pose.*

*Nathan and Lance stepped off the glyph causing it to fade away in a flash of purple light.*

Holland: "Lance, Nathan." *He lowered his arms, sounding surprised to see them.*

PKMY: "You were a little late, you just missed out on the best fight-"

Nathan: "There was a fight here, too?"

Lance: "Wateva-" *He rudely looked around, as if he didn't care.* "Where's Alicia? Inside the village?"

PKMY: *She formed a fist, grunting at Lance with a twitching eye.* (That little shit.)

Nathan: *He scratched his head and walked past Holland and PKMY, acknowledging them with a nod of his head.* (I can't wait to show the guild what The Sword of Memories looks like.)

Holland: *He noticed Lance's worn out expression.* "So, what happened?"

Lance: *He mumbled and sighed, placing a hand on his stomach.* "I'm starvin'! I'll tell the three of ya with something to eat-"

PKMY: "There's something about that."

Lance: "About that? Wat?" *He sighed in an annoyed-like manner as if he was too tired to care.*

Holland: "It's about Alicia."

Lance: *He froze and looked at Holland in concern.* "What about her?"

----------

*Tyler, Chrisma, Joy and Cameron faced Silver Wind Island, as a cold sea breeze wafted in their faces.*

Joy: "That was an amazing feat." *She glanced over to Tyler.* "Amazing to the both of you." *She quickly looked at Cameron who had Chrisma hanging off his arm.*

Tyler: "I'm not really happy how I defeated her, but thank you." *He spoke in a mature manner, as he stared at the tornado of Silver Triplets.*

Cameron: "I appreciate the feedback, Joy." *He looked at Chrisma in concern and leant forward, mumbling in her ear.*

Chrisma: "Oh, taken?" *She groaned in disappointment.*

*A purple glyph formed itself on the ground behind the party, instantly catching their attention.*

Cameron: *He turned around with a proud face, puffing out his chest.* "Who goes there?"

Season: *He stepped off the glyph and sighed in a satisfied-like manner, greeting the party with a smile.* "Hello there, friends."

Joy: "Oh my!"
Tyler: "Season!" *He shouted with a widening smile.*

----------

Ridley: *He flashstepped in mid-air and landed on small white pebbles, listening to them crunch under his feet.* "It would seem the last fight has ended with the number one ranking warriors.."

*Ridley glanced over his shoulder, listening to the howls of sandy winds blow in Maserio.*

Ridley: "How troubling... Although they were powerful, none possessed The Elemental Rage. The final limit of an Elementalist, whereas all potential unfolds in elemental fury-"

*Ridley paused and looked down in recollection, sighing in disappointment.*

Ridley: "It's too bad my first impression of Valhalla was a horrible one. The way I entered, it was to be expected."

*Ridley mumbled to himself and closed his eyes, slowly shaking his head.*

Ridley: "But.. I left them a present to remember me by." *He smirked and opened his eyes, staring at Surpreon.*

----------

Alicia: *She stepped off a purple glyph, instantly noticing Locki, Celest, Cassidy and Lorilei.* "L-Locki, C-Celest."

Celest: *She quickly turned around, facing Alicia in shock.* "Alicia."

Locki: "This is a terrible time, Alicia." *He sounded stressed and concerned.*

Alicia: "W-Why, what happened?"

Lorilei: "The Imperial Glacial Castle was compromised." *She spoke in a high voice, causing Alicia to look at her in an unfamiliar-like manner.*

Alicia: "H-How?"

Celest: "We don't know how, but it was the Consultant."

Alicia: (Ridley.) *She looked into the distance and admired the glistening ice castle, which sat neatly on a floating island.*

Locki: "His energy signature has somehow changed and therefore-"

Cassidy: "Is untraceable."

Alicia: "Oh okay." *She empathised with the party, cupping her pendant with both hands.*

Lorilei: "How possessed Radiatons, is that how he could get in undetected?"

Locki: "Most likely." *He sounded displeased.*

Celest: "So, thy take it thou're here to give your answer?"

Alicia: "Y-Yep-"

Celest: *She felt her stomach, causing her eye to twitch in pain.* "Locki, there isn't much thy can do, please excuse us?"

Locki: *He nodded his head in approval.* "Do what thou have to."

Alicia: "W-Well-"

Celest: "..." *She ignored Alicia and walked directly towards her, placing a hand on her shoulder.*

Alicia: "I-I can just tell you now-"

Locki: *He watched Alicia and Celest disappear in a flash of white light.* (What to do? No mere mortal has ever stepped foot on these holy grounds since it first ascended into the clouds.)

Cassidy: *He gritted his teeth in anger, recalling the events with Ridley.* "Thy still think we should all go right now and finish him!-"

*The Imperial Glacial Castle made an unusual sound, drawing the entire party's attention towards it.*

Cassidy: "What was that?"

Lorilei "Locki?"

Locki: "Thy've never heard it make that sound-"

*A sudden and violent dark eruption caused the castle to explode in half and the island to crack.*

Lorilei: *She stared at the shattering ice in disbelief.* "Oh, my-?!"

*A shadow-like pulse exploded underneath the castle, causing the island it sat on to slowly descend towards the clouds.*

Locki: *He dropped to his knees with his mouth open.* "..."

Cassidy: "Th-Thy don't...." *He froze on the spot, covering his mouth in disgust.*

*Several screams could be heard, as people witnessed the explosion.*

Lorilei: (This can't be tolerated.) *She appeared upset and unsure what to do.*

Cassidy: *He gritted his teeth, as his face twitched with emotion.* "Thy-" *He shook his head and started to run towards the descending glass-like ruins.*

Locki: "C-Cassidy!"

Cassidy: *Locki's words caused him to stop.* "Don't stop me-"

Locki: "We need to-"

Cassidy: "Let me check for any casualties in the explosion! Thy am sure thou have better things to do, like consult The Wise with what just happened!" *He spread his wings, as if he knew Locki would approve of him.*

Locki: *He nodded his head.* "Of course, go."

Cassidy: "..." *He stepped on the edge of the floating island and flapped his wings, flashstepping out of sight.*

Locki: (Pepper-) *He shook his head in anger.* "Thy must confront The Wise." *He disappeared in a flash of light.*

Lorilei: "Sofia..." *She whispered to herself, watching people fly towards the ruins.*

----------

*Clouds spiralled around the tip of a large mountain which housed forests, cliffs and caves.*

Sofia: *She hovered in the air, floating above the edge of a massive cliff.* "This power-" *She paused and listened to a radiant, hum-like sound coming from her black and white wings.*

Sofia: *The black and white wings disintegrated from her back, causing her to land on the cliff.* "This power, everybody will suffer game overs from now on."

*Sofia smirked evil-like and turned around, staring at the setting sun.*

Sofia: "Hahehahe."

*Sounds of prehistoric-like Scoldrants squawked and screeched in the background.*

Sofia: "With this power, I was able to find this-" *She spread her arms and fell backwards onto the ground.* "-Mount Kingdom Hall."

*Sofia licked her lips in an evil-like manner, staring up to the orange sky.*

Sofia: "A powerful Guardian in ancient times once protected The Philosopher's Heart here." *She giggled to herself, knowing she wasn't allowed to know such information.* "I can't believe one of Ridley's pawns was able to free all of them.. No, who's going to supply power to Sorrowprax now?"

*A red and black glyph glowed on Sofia's arm, causing her to lean up.*

Sofia: *She inspected the glyph and sighed, looking down with growing sadness.* "I will meet with Ridley for the last time, until we both gain control of each other's land."

*Sofia slowly stood up and rubbed the glowing glyph in determination.*

Sofia: "At least I get to have our Neurons and Astragons mix together, with the power of a Hi-Ougi." *She smirked at the thought and shook her body, sighing in pleasure.*

----------

*Tyler, Cameron, Joy and Chrisma faced Season, staring at him due to his unexpected appearance.*

Joy: "Season! Where have you been?" *She looked at Cameron who nodded his head in agreement.*

Season: "My apologies, I had to deal with personal affairs."

Cameron: "It is about The Rubistral Moon."

Tyler: *His eyes widened, as word of the moon caught his interest.* "W-What about it?"

Cameron: "We have been waiting to tell you with such urgency-"

Chrisma: (Yes!) *She groaned, eagerly nodding her head in agreement.*

Joy: "It even caused us to go out and look for you-"

Cameron: "When we realised you were not in the city."

Season: "Hmm?" *He started to look worried, noticing their stressed faces.*

Joy: "The cycle shows that the Neurons-"

Season: *He took a step forward, symbolising his sudden distress.* "When is it?"

Cameron: "In two days-" *He looked to the side and glanced at the setting sun.* "Well, three, if you include this sunset."

Tyler: *He gasped, squealing in thought.* (Two days?!)

Season: (Two?!) *He shouted in thought, staring at Cameron with widening eyes.*

----------

*The Astral Sanctum was quiet. Orbs of light made a holy-divine like sound, as they floated in the air like fireflies.*

?????: "Something calls..." *A woman's holy voice echoed throughout the sanctum.*

*The glyph made of golden circles vibrated and activated, slowly spiralling down to the ground.*

?????: "My power of light, is being used for the wrong reasons..."

*The golden glyph expanded across the floor, filling the sanctum with its treasure-like colour.*

*The glyph made the sounds of a door unlocking, as it began to spiral, causing particles of light to cluster towards the middle of the sanctum.*

*Twinkling sounds echoed around a rising golden pedestal, causing the orbs of light to float towards it.*

*The orbs of light clustered and merged into one, forming a circular shape.*

*The light faded revealing a silver orb, which hovered around head level.*

?????: "The Philosopher's Heart, activate." *Her divine voice echoed, causing the sounds of a device being turned on to come from the silver orb.*

*Platforms of silver glyphic rings spiralled around the silver orb, causing it to shine a fluoro white.*

*The orb's light liquefied and expanded, slowly taking shape to something.*

*The shape took the form of a woman completely naked and the light faded, as she slowly touched the floor.*

?????: "The Astral Sanctum?" *She looked around in a lost-like manner, slowly closing her eyes in thought.* "Thy have not seen this in a while."

*Long hair covered her face and breasts, keeping them hidden from sight.*

?????: "It would seem disaster has come not only to Valhalla, but the land below." *She opened her eyes and observed blue glyphic-like tattoos which covered her entire body.*

*Distress sounds of people could be heard as Valhalla's people responded to the destruction of The Imperial Glacial Castle.*

?????: "It is time, as Valkyrie, thy must do something about it." *She took several steps across the sanctum, causing sparkling light to swirl around her ankles.*

###

Michael: "Good flaming gravy, you made it! Thank you very much for reading! Without you, our heroes wouldn't have the incentive to continue on with their adventure! I hope you continue on and join us for the next part of The Rostical Users!"

*Michael giggled and continued to type with a widening smile.*

Michael: "If you thought this was a delicious adventure, or Neurons forbid, a poopy story, please give us a rating and review, it'll help others find our adventure! And.. Thank you again!"

*Michael stopped typing and glanced at the screen, pictured looking at you, yes you! The reader.*

Michael: "So, the Valkyrie?! Am I seriously going to leave it on a cliffhanger like that? Shiiiiit, no shame, Michael! No shame!"

Lezard: "Hello friends! Lezard found this part of the story fascinating and all that, but what about The Rostical Guild? Join Lezard's tale with his harem and our adventure in defeating our big villain!-"

Michael: "No, Lezard! And there is no Lezard harem!-"

Lezard: "Oooo! The drama! The coarse language! The bad writing!-"

Michael: "Ahem! If you have any delicious questions, feel free to email me here. I'm also on Facebook and Twitter! I find any feedback scrumptious and I will always reply back.
Hope to hear from you, little silly sausage!"

- Michael. R.

Either way, it's revealed that Teresa or Terra, had the power of light the entire time, but couldn't activate it, due to not having emotions. I was saddened with what happened during her last fight, but... *Sad face.*.

Season, at this point in the story/tale/adventure whatever, it felt like I was the medium instead of the writer, so I was shocked when Season revealed to us he was a coward.

After his closure with Dustin and his old party members, he wasn't heard of since until right at the end of 'Number One'.
