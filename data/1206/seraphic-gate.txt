Chapter 1: Black and Gold

Ridley: *He noticed the party step back with intimidation.* "Well-" *He smirked and clapped his hands together.* "This will be a very awkward fight if you all intend on being consumed with fear." *He smiled at each party member, waiting for their response.*

Lance: *He grunted and placed his hand on the side, hiding his anger.* "That smirk-"

Ridley: "What about it?" *He touched his lips, looking at Lance in confusion.*

Lance: "I won't ever forget it." *Lightning sparked and swirled in between his fingers, forming itself into a sword.*

Ridley: *He noticed the lightning, lowering his hand in a curious manner.* "I'm intrigued? What Remenistal is that?"

Cameron: *He reached over his shoulder and grabbed hold to something.* "Humph-" *His image disappeared leaving behind a swirl of sparks.*

Lance: "It's an ultimate Rostickal!" *He took a step forward and flashstepped, causing a pulse of grass to blow where he stood.*

Ridley: "Ultimate Remenistal?"

PKMY: "Tssk-" *She punched her fists together and charged towards Ridley.*

Season: "Tyler, Lezard, Holland, be on guard, the fight has finally started-" *He slowly stepped away from the party and a brown glyph formed itself under him.*

Tyler: (The final battle... This is it!...)

Freya: *She stood next to Holland.* (When do you want me to strike?)

Holland: *He shook his head, patiently waiting.* "Right now we'll just get in the way-"

Lance: *He appeared next to Ridley with the lightning sword raised.* "..." *He stared at Ridley's head, quickly slicing downwards.* (Got him?!)

Ridley: *He arched backwards barely avoiding the lightning.* "Did you seriously think you could possibly perform a sneak attack on me?"

Lance: *He watched the grass burn around his lightning in shock, as if he wasn't expecting Ridley to move.* (Dammit-)

Ridley: "Haha, you're certainly a funny one-"

Lance: "You!" *He raised his arm and took large steps towards Ridley, aimlessly slicing the lightning across his face.*

Cameron: *His image appeared in the air above Ridley.* "Humph-" *He looked down, raising his blue sword with glyphic symbols engraved on it.*

Ridley: *He avoided Lance's strikes without raising his arms.* (From above?) *He thought to himself, keeping his focus on Lance.*

Cameron: "Air Slash." *He waved the sword downwards, slicing a visible air slash towards Ridley.*

PKMY: "Yahoo-" *She somersaulted and flipped towards Ridley.*

Lance: "Avoid this then-" *He gripped the lightning with both hands, causing the lightning to double in thickness.* "Harh!" *He raised his arms and sliced it downwards.*

Ridley: "Aha, the folly!" *He raised both his arms and caught the visible air blade in one hand and the lightning in the other.*

Lance: "W-Wat?!" *He gasped in disbelief, watching the lightning dance in Ridley's hand.*
Cameron: "Preposterous!" *He looked down with a shocked face.* (He caught it with his bare hand!-)

PKMY: "Harh!" *She flipped into striking distance and kicked the ground, jumping over Ridley.*

Ridley: "Oh, what a sigh." *He flicked his wrists, causing both the air blade and lightning to shatter away.*

Lance: *He stumbled back with disorientation.* "Arh-?"

Ridley: "Hmm?" *He tilted his head up and watched PKMY jump above him in a spiralling motion.*

PKMY: "Raging Swirling Strike." *She swayed her arms and suddenly spiralled faster in the air, violently kicking Ridley in the face.*

Ridley: *He moved his arm at an amazing speed and blocked her kick with his hand.* "Flexible little one-"

PKMY: *Her hair and clothes flapped forward, due to suddenly stopping.* (How-?)

Ridley: "On Kath's behalf, I won't accept your betrayal to the warriors." *He smirked at PKMY, tightly holding onto her foot.*

Lance: *He clicked his fingers and lightning swirled in his hands, forming another sword.* "Don't act tough, I can do this all day!?"

Ridley: "Hmm? I see-"

PKMY: "Tssk." *She frowned with anger and pointed both hands at Ridley.*

Ridley: "With my power open the dark gates, silently gather and consume the hate-" *His arm shook, as he kept a firm grip on PKMY's foot.*

PKMY: *She tried to kick her way out of Ridley's grip, watching a green glyph spiral in front of her hands.* "AIR SWIRL-"

Ridley: "MANIPULATE, DARK STATE" *He pushed PKMY into the air and he twirled around, causing swirls of darkness to spiral around his hands.*

Cameron: *He landed on the ground and pointed the sword at Ridley, as his body glowed a shade of blue.* "Streaming Sword."

Ridley: "Please accept this token!" *He flicked his wrists up and a wave of darkness erupted from the ground, slamming into Lance and Cameron's stomach.*

Lance: "Bah-"
Cameron: "Gah-"

Lezard: "I know he's Consultant level, but it's not like he's even trying."

Holland: "..."

PKMY: *She looked down from the air, gritting her teeth at Ridley.* (He threw me this high with a wave of his hand?) *She kicked her legs, causing her to spiral back into striking distance.*

Ridley: *He looked back up, staring at PKMY surprised.* "Oh? Kicking off the air by creating a platform of Astragons, allowing you to alter course? Amazing." *He mumbled to himself with a smirk.*

PKMY: *She touched the ground with her toes and tightened her fists, readying to punch Ridley in the face.* "Shut it-"

Ridley: "NIGHTSHADE" *He straightened his arm and a ball of shadow grew in front of his palm.* "Goodbye, red-haired capt-"

*A pillar of rock erupted up from the ground and smashed into Ridley's chest, causing an instant dirt cloud to form around him.*

Season: "GROUND SHAKING"

PKMY: *The tremors caused her to lose balance.* "Tssk, watch where you're using your Rostical!" *She looked behind her at Season.*

Season: "Not now!-"

*A stream of black lightning blasted out of the dirt cloud and into PKMY's shoulder, causing her to scream.*

Holland: "Amy!"

Fryfry: *A swarm of fireflies flew out of a spiralling red glyph, which instantly materialised in the air.* (Myrror Shield.) *The outer fireflies crossed paths in front of PKMY, forming a glass-like reflective shield.*

Ridley: *He watched the black lightning flash in front of the shield.* "Oh? You blocked it?"

PKMY: *She watched the shield shine, causing the black lightning's stream to break.* (Thanks, Fryfry.)

Fryfry: "Bzzzst."

Ridley: "Marvellous-"

Lezard: "HEALING RINGS" *He waved his arms in the air and white rings spiralled around Lance, Cameron and PKMY.*

Tyler: "Here-" *He reached into the RPG bag and quickly threw his hand in the air.*

Ridley: "Oh-?" *He watched a green gas spiral around PKMY, before fading into nothing.*

Tyler: "Acro Berries!"

Ridley: *He raised his arm and casually waved it to one side, instantly blowing the dirt away* "Hmm? This is no good."

*Ridley shook his head, watching Lance, Cameron and PKMY stand back on their feet, as if nothing happened.*

PKMY: *She lowered her head and gritted her teeth.* (Not a good start-)

Ridley: "Lezard, I like your father's hat." *He watched the rings of light fade, causing him to glance at Lezard.* "It suits you-"

Lezard: "Don't you dare!"

Cameron: *He tightened his grip on the sword and flashstepped next to Ridley.* "Humph." *He sliced the air across, causing Ridley to step back.*

Ridley: "Wow, that was close-"

Lance: "LIGHTNING BLAST" *He straightened his arm and a stream of lightning blasted towards Ridley from behind.*

Ridley: "Forceful sounds, radiate the ground, as deep as abyss, DARK STYX" *Shadow enveloped Lance's lightning, causing it to swirl around him and towards Cameron.*

PKMY: "Lance, stop it now!"

Lance: "Tssk-" *He looked at PKMY in shock and quickly lowered his arm, causing the lightning to disintegrate away.*

Cameron: *His eyes widened, as strings of lightning sparked past his face.* "..."

Ridley: "Oh, so close!" *He smiled with failure.* "I'm hoping one of you destroys yourself-"

PKMY: "Shut up! Seven finger snap-flying palm strike." *She placed her hand behind her side, flashstepping in front of Ridley.*

Lance: *He aimed for Ridley's side and pushed forward, blasting a stream of lightning towards him.* "LIGHTNING BLAST"

PKMY: "Harh!" *She pushed her hand into Ridley's chest, causing a water-like ripple to envelop her hand.* "Heh, you're gone-"

Ridley: "Oh, really?" *He mumbled in a bored-like tone, casually grabbing onto her wrist.* "Snap."

PKMY: "Snap?" *She looked confused, as she tried to pull herself away.*

Ridley: "Oh yes, the snapping-" *He flicked his wrist, causing PKMY to collapse to the ground in pain.*

PKMY: "Argh-"

Ridley: "Tssk, tssk, Lance-" *He swayed his free hand to the side, backhanding the lightning away from him.*

Lance: *He lowered his arm, frowning in shock.* "How the-?"

Ridley: *He focused his attention back to PKMY, tightening his grip.* "Haven't heard that snap yet-"

*A ring of fire flared in Ridley's face and exploded, allowing PKMY to kick herself out of his grip.*

Ridley: "My, Caesar-" *He slid back along the grass, waving smoke out of his face.* "What a strong burst of Neurons-"

Season: "FIRE'S PULSE" *A ring of flame extinguished around his hand.*

PKMY: *She slid back along the ground on her toes, noticing an instant bruise which formed around her wrist.* (He was going to break my wrist!-)

Lance: *He sighed with anger and clicked his fingers, causing lightning to spark.* "Air Slash." *He raised his lightning sword, watching Ridley slide across the ground.* "Harh." *He slashed across his shoulder and a visible air blade sliced through the air towards Ridley.*

Ridley: "Meaningless-"

Cameron: *His image appeared directly in front of Ridley.* "Hmph-" *He lunged the sword towards Ridley's neck.*

Ridley: "Sword of arts, this sword is the start, rot and decay, haste and make no delay, ROTTING SWORD" *A black sword puffed like smoke in his hand.*

PKMY: "Tssk." *She shook his hand, watching Cameron's sword touch Ridley's neck.* (Got him-?!)

Ridley: "Good reflexes, Cameron-" *He flicked his wrist and moved the black sword at blinding speeds, blocking Cameron's strike.*

Cameron: *He watched sparks flash off his sword in shock, as if he wasn't expecting Ridley to block his attack.* (It is smoke-)

Ridley: *He looked past the swords, smiling at Cameron.* "Very strong-"

Cameron: *He leant forward with gritted teeth, attempting to jab the sword through Ridley's black sword.* (I can not break it!)

Apollo: (It just shows what kind of level his Neurons are at!-)

Ridley: *He raised his other arm and pointed it to his side without losing eye contact on Cameron.* "You've become much stronger-" *He caught an air blade which screeched from Lance's direction.*

Cameron: *His arm and cape blew in the wind, caused by Lance's attack.* (Have I underestimated the Consultant's power?)

Ridley: *He flicked his wrist, causing the air blade to swirl away.* "Useless-" *He smirked and straightened his arm towards Cameron's face.* "NIGHTSH-"

PKMY: *She flashstepped next to Ridley.* "Double Smack." *She spun around and backhanded Ridley across the face.*

Ridley: "Oof-?!"

PKMY: *She spiralled around and slapped downwards, flicking his nose.* "Heh-" *She placed her hands on the ground and lifted her legs in the air, kicking him in the stomach.*

Ridley: *He leant forward, pretending to ignore PKMY's kick.* "Strong, Amy-"

Lance: "Air Slash." *He sliced his lightning sword downwards, causing a line of dirt to blast towards Ridley.*

PKMY: "Thanks, shithead!-" *She stood on one hand and looked up, forming a fist with her free hand.* "Airs pulsing, searing and soaring, rippling strike."

Ridley: "Hmm, oh what shall I ever do?"

Cameron: "Die!" *He grunted in anger.*

Ridley: "I can't do that-" *He slashed the sword, knocking Cameron back.*

Cameron: *He awkwardly stepped back, watching black and blue sparks scatter off his sword.* (Not possible! His Neurons are at a level where a jab from my sword could not break its structural integrity-)

Ridley: "Swirling shadows flock, with the motion all will block, darkness strikes hearts with fear, NIGHT SPHERE" *A whirl of mist-like shadow swirled around him, forming into a barrier.*

PKMY: "Harh." *She punched towards Ridley's feet and a pulse of shadow swirled in front of her.*

Ridley: *He noticed a punch-like dent in the shield outside, causing him to glance at PKMY.* (That would've smarted.)

PKMY: (My Neuron-filled punch! It was blocked!) *She flipped back up, landing on her feet.*

Ridley: *The ground suddenly burst next to him and a slash-like trail of shadow puffed in the air above his shield.* "Oh? Another Air Slash, Lance? Not bad."

Lance: "Shut it, will you?!" *He ran towards the shadow-like sphere, straightening his arm at it.*

Tyler: "Season, do something?"

Season: *He shook his head, recalling the time Ridley manipulated Lance's lightning.* "Knowing he can alter the course of Rostical, I don't want to risk it-"

Cameron: *He flashstepped next to the sphere and held the sword with both hands, watching an aura swirl around it.* "I will break your barrier! Hard Blade."

Ridley: "All in attacking range? Oh dear." *He clicked his fingers and the shield exploded, knocking Cameron, PKMY and Lance into the air.*

Lance: "Shit!-"
PKMY: "Tssk!"
Cameron: "Tcch-"

Tyler: "This isn't looking good-"

Lezard: "HEALING RINGS" *He raised his arms and white rings formed themselves around Cameron, PKMY and Lance before they hit the ground.*

Holland: "Alright, Freya, now it's our turn-" *He took a step forward, preparing himself to run.*

Ridley: "Now, now-" *He quickly glanced behind him to the Spacial Funnel.* (It still requires some time-) "Why don't we talk about this?"

Lance: *He grunted and leant up, watching the light heal his grass burns.* "No-"

Ridley: "To be honest, Lance, I don't blame you for your disgusting attitude."

Lance: "Wat?"

Ridley: "You are that weak you couldn't even save your beloved best friend."

Lance: *He swayed his arm to the side, causing lightning to swirl into a sword.* "H-Huh?"

Ridley: "If only you were stronger, he would still be alive."

Season: "What is he-?"

Ridley: "I can see it now.. He'd be having a giggle at one of your jokes and just being friendly."

Lance: *He looked shocked and stared at the ground, as the lightning in his hand swirled away.* "I.."

Season: "Lance, don't fall for it!"

Ridley: "Oh, Season, you seem quite cheery."

Season: "What's that supposed to mean?!" *A blue glyph formed itself under his feet.*

Ridley: "Oh? You don't know, do you?!" *He chuckled, casually swaying the black sword to each side.* "Surpreon, it's completely destroyed."

Season: "W-What?" *He stared at Ridley and paused in shock, causing the glyph to slowly fade away.*

Ridley: "I knew about the barrier, and, let me tell you. It was strong." *He smiled and sighed.*

Season: (He can't be telling the truth-) *He dropped to his knees in disbelief.* (How would he even know-..?)

Ridley: "Cameron, why are you attacking me? I have no idea why you would betray me?"

Cameron: *He stood up and faced Ridley, ignoring the white rings which spiralled around him.* "You betrayed me!"

Ridley: "No I didn't? You're my number one. I've put a lot of trust into you."

Tyler: (The barrier? I told him the barrier...) *He shook his head with a dropping jaw, looking at his hands in shock and disgust.*

Cameron: "You sent Sofia to kill me!"

Ridley: "Sofia? That low ranking captain? Don't be absurd! Is this why you never came back to Sorrowprax after your mission with Teresa?"

Cameron: "Teresa was an ex-number one ranking captain!"

Ridley: *He gasped in shock.* "Was she really?"

Cameron: *He paused and hesitantly lowered his sword.* "Y-You did not know?"

Holland: "Don't believe his lies, Cameron! Let's get him, Amy-"

PKMY: "I-I can't-"

Holland: "Why?" *He grunted in confusion, keeping his focus on Ridley.*

PKMY: "H-Holly-" *She held her head in pain and her knees buckled.* "Grr, it hurts!"

Holland: *He looked at PKMY worried, glancing at Lezard.* "What's wrong?!"

Lezard: *He shook his head.* "She's completely healed."

Holland: "Dang it, Amy!" *He ran up to PKMY to see if she was hurt.*

PKMY: "Their emotions, their sudden sadness. It hurts me-"

Ridley: "Oh, you care for each other. It's cute seeing how you all have bonded-"

Holland: *He frowned and looked at Ridley.* "You have nothing to say to me!" *He stood up, causing Freya to growl.* "Let's get him!"

Freya: "Ruff!"

Ridley: "Well, it's true. I have nothing to say to you." *He swayed the black sword, as if he didn't care about the party's presence.*

Lezard: "Lezard will back you up!" *He adjusted his hat and stood in a battle-ready pose.*

Holland: *His muscles bulged and he charged directly for Ridley.* "Freya-" (Gargling Whirlpool behind me to trap him, and I'll attack with several punches.)

Freya: *She pranced behind Holland, growing in size.* (Got it!) *She growled in thought and raised her snout, gargling water.* (Gargling Whirlpool.)

Holland: *He raised his fist and ignored a vortex of water which spiralled around him towards Ridley.* "You seriously need to stop smiling!"

Ridley: "But, I'm excited that I've nearly completed our plan?" *His hair flapped, as strings of water blasted past his sides.*

Holland: *He ran into striking distance, forming a fist.* "Good for you!-"

Ridley: "Good for me." *He looked at Holland with a widening smile.*

Holland: (He's not even attempting to raise his sword against me!-) "Harh." *He squinted his eyes and punched Ridley in the face.*

Freya: (That pain? What happened?!) *She barked in thought, keeping a steady vortex-like swirl of water around Holland and Ridley.*

Holland: "What?" *He grunted in pain as his hand came to a complete stop.*

Ridley: *He stared at Holland's fist.* "Your fist was very close-"

Holland: *He stared in front of him in shock.* "Why?"

Cameron: *He held Holland's fist with an emotionless face.* "I am sorry, I thought you had betrayed me."

Holland: "Answer me, Cameron?!" *He gasped in disbelief.*

Cameron: "Will you forgive me?"

Ridley: "Of course." *He silently smirked at Holland from behind Cameron.*

Holland: *He noticed Ridley's face, causing him to frown.* "H-He's lying!-"

Cameron: "Air Slash." *He waved his sword past Holland, slicing a visible air blade into the distance.*

Freya: "Owroo-?" *She quickly leant forward and jumped to the side, as the ground exploded where she stood.* "Grah?" *She slid on her side across the ground, staring at Cameron with heightened vision.*

Cameron: *He watched the water lose its current, causing it to splash around him.* "Why would he lie? It is understandable once I have heard his side of the story."

Holland: "Cameron."

Cameron: "I am number one of the warriors, I must uphold that title. ICICLE EDGE" *He pushed Holland away and raised his arm, causing a large ice lance to form above him.*

Holland: *His legs shook, as he slid back from Cameron.* "Damn it! Freya."

Freya: "Ruff!" (Aerial Pounce.) *She bent her legs and jumped high into the air.* (Sonic Roar.) *She barked out a visible shockwave towards Cameron.*

Cameron: "Humph." *He pretended to throw a spear, causing the ice to blast into the air towards Freya.*

Holland: "Freya!-" *He watched the shockwave shatter the ice lance into a scattered spray away from her.*

Freya: (I'm fine-) *She extended and flapped her wings, staying in the air.*

Cameron: *He flashstepped in front of Holland and kicked him in the gut.* "Hmph-" *He pushed his foot further and blasted Holland across the ground towards Tyler and Lezard.*

Holland: "Ah-" *He tumbled on the ground, causing Fryfry to swarm towards him.*

Fryfry: *It buzzed around Holland and raised their shield, causing him to gently slid along the ground.* "Bzzz."

Holland: *He noticed he slowed down and looked over his shoulder, noticing the shield.* "Thanks."

Ridley: *He sighed and placed his hand on his temple.* "Cameron, keep him busy. Once I complete my plan, I'll deal with Sofia myself."

Cameron: *He nodded his head in a professional manner and raised the sword, pointing it at the party.* "Of course."

Apollo: (Cameron, listen to me! I do not believe this is the right thing to do-)

Cameron: (The notion of Sofia telling the truth is a fallacy.)

Ridley: (A loyal number one-) *He slowly turned around and walked towards the Spacial Funnel.* (Such idiocy.) *He shook his head with a smirk.*

*A cold gust of wind blew across the vacant land.*

Lezard: "His mind games impacted the entire party with offensive capabilities." *He mumbled with a loss of hope, causing Tyler to look at him.*

Tyler: "Cameron, w-what are you doing?"

Holland: *The shield shattered as the fireflies disintegrated into nothing.* "He's not listening to reason!" *He stood up straight and stared at Cameron.*

Tyler: *He took short deep breaths.* (This, this, this is not how I imagined-) "-This shouldn't be turning out so bad!"

Lezard: "Not you too, Tyler-?"

Tyler: "Cameron, you're intelligent like Teresa! Why are you being so easily fooled?!" *He yelled with emotion, causing Freya, Holland and Lezard to look at him in shock.*

Freya: *She circled in the air and kept a close eye on Cameron.* (His stance, there is no opening.)

Cameron: "I was a fool to think the Consultant meant any harm towards me!"

Tyler: "No! I thought you were part of the party!" *He reached into the RPG bag, squealing with emotion.*

Cameron: *He focused his attention on Tyler's arm.* "Remove your hand from the bag, or-"

Tyler: "Or you'll what? Defeat me? Kill me?" *He took a step closer, causing Lezard to grab his arm.*

Lezard: "I don't feel any Neurons from you, don't be foolish, young one."

Tyler: *He gently pushed Lezard's hand away.* "I-I'm fine."

PKMY: *She sat on her knees panting while watching Tyler shuffle past her towards Cameron.* (I feel such an immense feeling of fear coming from him-)

Tyler: "Well?!"

Cameron: "I have only seen you use your unusual Ougi-" *He glanced at Season, watching him stare at the ground.* "Perhaps you know something else..."

*Cameron mumbled to himself and squinted his eyes, looking back to Tyler.*

Cameron: "But you have no fighting skills, do not be childish!"

Tyler: "In my opinion, you're the one that's being childish!" *His heart thumped through his shirt.*

Cameron: "My loyalty is with the Consultant-"

Tyler: "Fine, then I'll fight you myself." *His fingers twitched with fear.*

Cameron: *He sighed and pointed the sword at Tyler.* "If you wish to end it, so be it."

----------

Sofia: *She giggled at Lorilei and Cassidy, watching them look at her.* "You two are just staring at me, how boring!"

Cassidy: "I'll show you boring!" *He reached behind his back and pulled his arm in front, causing a string of sparks to scatter around his arm.*

Sofia: "Oh?" *She looked at the sparks with slight excitement.*

Cassidy: *He held a divine bamboo staff which was four times larger than his body.* "Why did thou betray us?!"

Sofia: "'Cause you were all boring."

Lorilei: "That's not good, Sofia."

Cassidy: "You bitch." *He held the staff with both hands and tightened his grip, swirling his arms and hands.*

Lorilei: *She watched the staff move at near blinding speeds, listening to its hollow, whoosh-like sounds.* "This is madness, Sofia."

Sofia: "In order to level up, you need to step up the difficulty." *She licked her lips, giggling in an evil-like manner.*

Cassidy: "You're ill!-"

Sofia: "The only person that can give you opportunities, is yourself!"

Cassidy: *He frowned at Sofia, spinning the staff at an increasing speed.* "Then you will suffer."

Sofia: *She ignored Cassidy, admiring his skill with the staff.* "Hah? That's nice-"

Cassidy: *He raised the staff behind him in one hand and charged towards Sofia, causing her to look alert.* "Betrayal is not tolerated-"

Sofia: (I better take Cassidy and Lorilei seriously-) *She reached to her thigh and raised her arm, causing a wave of sparks to scatter behind her.* "Yee harh!"

*Sofia raised her arm and swirled a large leather whip above her, catching Cassidy's attention.*

Cassidy: "A whip.. Like I said to you many times-" *He spun around and jabbed the staff past Sofia's head.*

Sofia: *Her ponytail violently flapped around the staff.* "Missed."

Cassidy: "Whips are not a good choice of weapon."

Sofia: "Hahe hahehahe-" *She opened her mouth in excitement and flicked her wrist, causing the whip to slither towards Cassidy.*

Cassidy: *He quickly leant back and whacked the staff across Sofia's face.* "Humph." *He jumped to the side, barely avoiding the whip.*

Sofia: "Hahe, ouch-" *She looked to the side where Cassidy hit her.*

Lorilei: *She looked down, noticing a crack in the stone from where Sofia's whip landed.* "She has Neurons inside the whip!-"

Sofia: "Hahe-" *She laughed at Lorilei and flicked the whip back into the air above her.*

Cassidy: "Give up-"

Sofia: *She paused and stepped back, trying to contain her excitement.* "Sticky Smash."

Cassidy: "Humph." *He ignored a growing shade of blue around Sofia's body.* "Harh." *He spun around while spinning the staff in the opposite direction.* "Ha!" *He slammed the staff across Sofia's face, knocking her head to the other side.*

Sofia: "Hahe!" *A small stream of blood ran from her lips, causing her to lick it.* "Delicious-"

Cassidy: *He spun the staff in one hand as he stepped back, looking at Sofia in disgust.* "You were always strange, but you weren't ever like this."

Sofia: "How would you know?" *The whip slithered towards Cassidy, as if it had a mind of its own.*

Cassidy: "Darn it-" *He spun his body and the staff.* "Harh!" *He whacked the tip of the whip away, causing a stream of sparks to scatter.*

Sofia: *She watched the whip slightly flick back, due to Cassidy's swing.* "You've grown weak-"

Cassidy: "What are you talking about? You're the one that seems weak-"

Sofia: "Hiyah-" *She waved her arm across, snapping the whip towards Cassidy's face.*

Cassidy: "Sphere of Might." *He hit the staff on the ground, causing a sphere-like pulse to blow the whip into the opposite direction.*

Sofia: "Haheha!" *She smirked, discreetly watching the whip pierce through the air on its own accord.*

Cassidy: *He frowned at Sofia, pointing his staff at her.* "Is your defeat that hilarious?"

Lorilei: *She looked to the side and gasped.* "Cassidy!-"

Sofia: *She watched the whip slither into striking distance, suddenly wrapping itself around Cassidy's wrist.* "Hahe, whips aren't a good choice of weapon?"

Cassidy: "How-?" *He spoke under his breath, listening to the leather tighten around his wrist.* "You didn't move your arm-?"

Sofia: "Gotcha-"

Cassidy: ".. I'll have to use it already?" *He threw his staff into the air, causing Sofia to look up in disappointment.*

Sofia: "Given up-?"

Cassidy: "Ougi-" *He flicked his wrist, causing the staff to spiral downwards.*

Lorilei: (Smacking Platoon-..)

Cassidy: "One-"

Sofia: "Harh?" *The staff slammed itself on top of her head, causing her to squint her eyes and grit her teeth.*

Lorilei: "Lines merge and confuse my enemy, NORTHERN LIGHTS" *She formed two fists and punched in front, causing needle-like lights to disorientate Sofia.*

Sofia: "Hah?" *She rapidly blinked in discomfort.*

Cassidy: *He noticed the whip's grip weaken, allowing him to pull his hand free.* "Two-" *He waved his hand upwards, causing the staff to slam Sofia under the chin in an uppercut-like motion.*

Sofia: "Kerh-"

Cassidy: "Three-" *He twirled around and threw his hand downwards, causing the staff to smash Sofia across the cheek.*

Sofia: "Ah-" *She leant down, watching the staff spiral across the ground.*

Cassidy: "Four-" *He cupped his hands and threw them to the side, watching the staff suddenly whack Sofia across the face.*

Sofia: "Hahe-" *She smirked, noticing a slight graze mark on her cheekbone.*

Cassidy: *He twirled around, causing the staff to spiral in the air behind Sofia.* "Five!-" *He pretended to swing the staff in front.*

Lorilei: *She watched the staff slam and whack Sofia in different directions.* (Locki considered Cassidy's Ougi very bland, yet very effective.)

Sofia: *She continued to open and close her eyes, ignoring the constant and consistent strikes of Cassidy's staff.* (I'm going to have to use these powers already?)

Cassidy: *He angrily swung his arm and watched the staff soar through the air around Sofia.* (I've dealt about three critical hits.)

Sofia: (It hurts-) *She smirked in pain and stared in front in a blind-like manner, as the staff slammed against the side of her head.* (Hurry up vision-)

Lorilei: (Her vision, the Rostical is wearing off-) "ARCTIC FUNNEL" *She watched snow spiral and cluster around Sofia.*

Sofia: (It's getting cold-?) *The snow touched her skin and ice suddenly exploded on her arms, causing her to grunt in pain.*

Cassidy: "Ha, I have no idea why the mistress was worried about you-" *He raised his arms and dropped them, causing the staff to slam on top of Sofia's shoulder.* "Six-"

Lorilei: (You wanted to be a Sacred Knight.. You didn't get what you wanted, so you've become this?) *She raised her hand in front and opened her hand, as a red glyph glowed around her.*

Sofia: *She frowned at Lorilei and Cassidy, ignoring her beaten up appearance.* "Haheha, even with both of you, I'm still a few levels ahead-"

Lorilei: "FLAME BOLT" *She shouted with an echoing voice and pushed forward, blasting several fireballs at Sofia.*

Sofia: *The balls of fire shot into her chest, shattering the ice and exploded.* "Arh-" *She tumbled back and collapsed onto the rocky cliff, lying on her back.*

Cassidy: *He smirked and flicked his wrist, causing the staff to spiral back into his hand.* "Mission completed?"

Lorilei: "Oh my, it would appear so-"

Sofia: "Hehehahehaheha." *She lay motionless on the ground, chuckling with her eyes closed.*

Lorilei: *She focused her attention back to Sofia, raising her arms in a defensive manner.* "..."

Sofia: "Who's the mistress? And, mission completed?" *She slowly stood back onto her feet and opened her eyes.*

Cassidy: "We can defeat you, you're already been weakened-"

Sofia: "Hee hee hee." *Her eyes shined a beautiful golden colour and she raised her arm, causing the whip to twirl in the air.*

Cassidy: (She's activated her Radiatons to the point her eyes changed colour-)

Sofia: *She dropped her arm, causing the whip to make a loud slap-like sound.* "This is merely the beginning of your game over!" *She smirked with confidence and stood up straight unaffected by the damage she received.*

Lorilei: "Be careful, Cassidy, there's something off about her." *She whispered to Cassidy in a wary manner.*

----------

Cameron: *He stood on the spot in confusion, watching Tyler charge towards him.* "..."

Tyler: *He frowned with gritted teeth, ignoring the fear induced sweat on his face.* "Ougi-"

Cameron: *He flashstepped directly in front of Tyler and punched him in the gut.* "If it makes you feel any better, I am not entirely pleased with this-"

Tyler: "Gerwarh-" *He wheezed over Cameron's arm and coughed out blood.* "B-But-"

Cameron: *He raised his sword, hesitantly glancing at the back of Tyler's neck.* "Forgive me-" *He looked to the side and quickly flashstepped away from Tyler, blowing wind in his face.*

Tyler: (Huh?) *He dropped to his knees and instinctively held his stomach, looking up in confusion.*

*Brazza and Pickles flashstepped in front of Tyler and faced Cameron, standing in battle-ready poses.*

Holland: *He stared at Brazza and Pickles' backs.* "It's you two from before, what happened to the Scoldrants?"

Freya: "Ruff." *She dived down next to Holland and barked in agreement.*

Brazza: "Their eyes faded and their violent attitude disappeared."

Holland: "What?" *He gasped to himself.*

Freya: (Their eyes, faded?) *She looked up to Holland in confusion.*

Lezard: (The yellow-eyed disease disappeared? Does that mean the guild was successful?!)

Ridley: (I won't allow that pestering party to distract me furthermore!-) *He raised his arms and started to concentrated on the Spacial Funnel.* (None of them are no longer a threat to me.)

Pickles: *She glanced at Cameron in confusion.* "Weren't you with the party?"

Cameron: *He noticed their uniforms.* "Aren't you loyal to the Consultant?"

Brazza: *He shrugged his shoulders.* "I got bored of him."

Pickles: "And I'm making my own choice."

Cameron: "Disgusting-"

Tyler: *He awkwardly inhaled and looked up to Brazza and Pickles.* "I don't understand-"

Pickles: *She looked over her shoulder to Tyler and back in front to Cameron.* (As number one candidates, the reason why a number two cannot become a number one is due to extensive training from such a young age.)

Lezard: "HEALING RINGS" *He waved his arms around Tyler, causing white rings to spiral around him.*

Tyler: *He closed his eyes, taking a deep breath of relief.* (I can breathe better now.)

Lezard: (Just in case-) "Quick internal light, INVOKING AURA"

Tyler: *A swirl of light flashed around his stomach, causing him to look at Lezard in appreciation.* (No more pain-)

Lezard: *He tipped his hat at Tyler, focusing his attention on Cameron.* "..."

Pickles: *She stared at Cameron, exhaling smoke-like mist.* (The fundamental rules are imprinted through training, so in a sense, it's understandable why he's acting like this-)

Tyler: *He stepped forward and adjusted the RPG bag's strap, walking in between Brazza and Pickles.* "Cameron, he was lying to you."

Cameron: "I do not believe he was-"

Tyler: "If you can't believe my words, then trust me as a friend!"

Cameron: *He looked at his sword in confusion.* "..."

Apollo: (Cameron?)

Cameron: (Be quiet, Apollo.)

Lezard: *He hobbled up to Tyler, Brazza and Pickles.* "Blake is no longer part of the warriors, that would mean he's your enemy, too?"

Cameron: "B-Blake?" *He mumbled and looked down.*

Apollo: (There is no way I would accept Blake as our enemy!)

Cameron: "Tcch." *He formed fists, failing to control his growing emotionally confused-driven state.*

Brazza: *He noticed Ridley in front of the Spacial Funnel.* (Let's see how strong he is-) *He smirked and rocked his head, flicking hair out of his face.*

Pickles: "People sometimes choose to ignore what their friends say because they're in denial, they don't want to believe it's true!"

Cameron: *He silently stared at the ground, pretending not to listen.* "..."

Brazza: (Right, Pickles has got this-) *He flashstepped behind Ridley and raised his arm, causing bundles of red lightning to swirl down his arm.*

Ridley: *He looked behind him and sighed.* "Even lying to Cameron, I was hoping he had the power to fend you all off-"

Brazza: *The lightning's power intensified, as it violently sparked across his face.* "Harh!"

Ridley: "Or at least-" *He faced Brazza and casually grabbed his arm, causing the lightning to spark away.* "-Keep you all occupied before the Spacial Funnel had completed."

Brazza: "What? Let go-"

Ridley: *He flicked his wrist, causing Brazza's arm to crack.* "Oh well, you're all expendable-"

Brazza: "You! Ougi-"

Ridley: "Useless-" *He grabbed the black sword and effortlessly rammed it into Brazza's chest.*

Brazza: "Karh-" *He held his breath with widening eyes.*

*Pickles and Cameron looked at Ridley in shock.*

Pickles: "Brazza!" *She stepped forward to flashstep.*

Tyler: *He quickly grabbed Pickles' hand.* "Don't-"

Ridley: *He ripped the sword out and raised it above Brazza's head.* "You couldn't even kill your intended targets-"

Brazza: *He awkwardly pointed in Ridley's face, frowning in desperation.* "Pfft-"

Ridley: "None of you did-" *He bent forward and sliced through Brazza's body, tapping the ground with the tip of the sword.*

Brazza: "Karh-" *Blood ran down the sides of his mouth and small white orbs floated from his back.*

Tyler: *He covered his mouth with both hands, watching Brazza's body burst into tiny white orbs in disgust.* (Did I imagine that, or did Ridley just slice through that man's body-?!)

Pickles: *She grunted in anger as bursts of ice exploded in her hands.* "You!"

Holland: *He looked at PKMY and stepped towards her, grunting at Freya.* (Come on-)

Freya: *She looked at Holland, watching him run towards PKMY.* (Coming!)

Holland: *He looked worried and kneeled down, trying to see PKMY's face.* (Amy?)

Freya: *She trotted next to Holland and growled in frustration, watching PKMY shiver with emotion.* (Get up!)

Tyler: *He stared at Ridley and took a deep nervous breath, looking at Pickles.* "I-I will assist."

Pickles: *She nodded her head and flashstepped above Ridley.* "We served you, and you treated us like nothing!-"

Ridley: "What a sigh, this is what I created? Rebellion captains?" *He looked up, raising the black, blood covered sword.*

Pickles: *She watched the ice shatter into sword-like spears, pointing them down at Ridley.* "It was your methods as a leader that led to this-"

Ridley: *He pointed at Brazza's white orbs in a taunting manner.* "It was actually your methods that led to that-"

Tyler: "Ougi! Mastered state of Alchemy and Crafting I show you, Ragnarok." *White liquid swirled out of the RPG bag and around his hands.*

Pickles: "Argh!" *She threw the swords of ice downwards at Ridley.* "This is my choice!"

Ridley: "Well it's not a good one-" *He sidestepped, avoiding one of the ice swords.* "Not a good one at all-" *He waved his hand above his head, backhanding the other ice swords away.*

Pickles: "The decision of my choices shouldn't be affected by what anyone has to say!" *She landed on the ground and cupped her hands, hiding her anger for Brazza.*

Ridley: "Such folly! I don't need to be taught morals!-"

Pickles: *She charged towards Ridley and tightened her grip, causing an eruption of ice to explode around her hands.* "Maybe you do!"

Ridley: *He discreetly frowned at Pickles, as if he wasn't impressed with what she said.* "I'll shatter whatever you come up with-"

Pickles: "I've increased the density of the ice in this one!-" *She screamed with emotion and watched the ice shatter into a large scythe, raising it behind her.*

Tyler: *The liquid formed itself into two handguns and he aimed them at Ridley.* (I can do this!)

Pickles: "Harh." *She stepped into striking distance and sliced the scythe at an incredible speed, causing it to screech through the air.*

Ridley: *He ducked and jumped back, as he attempted to move out of range.* (She's faster than I predicted-) *He stepped back on one foot and moved to the side, as the scythe scratched his cheek.*

Pickles: "Naice!" *She gritted her teeth with concentration, as she continued to barely miss Ridley's head.*

Lezard: *He noticed the cut on Ridley's cheek, causing him to unintentionally smirk with hope.* (Blood! He's not immortal.)

Ridley: "Now it's time for you to join your comrade-" *He pushed himself back and raised the sword.* "DEMONIC SIOVANCE"

Pickles: *She pointed the scythe at Ridley, watching it shatter to pieces.* "Watch the level of my Elementalist abilities-"

Ridley: "Why did you destroy a perfectly good weapon-?"

Pickles: "Harh.." *The shards of ice formed into needles and they all suddenly pointed in Ridley's direction.*

Ridley: (I see-) "But useless-" *Several fluoro green bullets shot past his head, causing him to look at Tyler in the distance in shock.* (I didn't even sense those projectiles-)

*A blast of ice needles shot into Ridley's right arm, causing him to drop the sword in pain.*

Ridley: (How-?) *He discreetly frowned in an annoyed manner.*

Pickles: "Don't lose your concentration!" *Ice erupted under her and she blasted herself forward, sliding on the ice towards Ridley.*

Ridley: "Exactly right, captain-" *He flicked his arm, causing the ice needles to shatter away.*

Pickles: "Try an ice mallet-" *She ignored Ridley and suddenly stopped with a wheeze, watching dark-blue strings wrap themselves around her legs.*

Ridley: "Enjoy your last moments-" *He sighed in disappointment.*

Pickles: *She tried to step forward, causing more strings to wrap around her legs.* (When did he use this-?)

Ridley: "Regardless of your ranking, as a captain classed warrior-" *He looked down, watching the black sword puff into smoke.* "This is appalling."

Pickles: "My last moments?" *She watched ice explode and shatter into swords in her hands, slicing the dark-blue strings off her legs.*

Ridley: *He ignored what Pickles said, noticing the cut strings puff into smoke.* (She broke some of the Remenistal's form-)

Pickles: "I will freeze your existence-"

Ridley: "Once I take control of my new land. I'll ensure violence like this, never gets to see the light of day again."

Pickles: "It's not over!-" *She looked down and stared at a glowing black glyph underneath her, readying to slice the remaining strings away.*

Ridley: "It is." *He cupped his hands towards Pickles and concentrated, causing a wave of strings to wrap themselves around her arms.*

Tyler: "Aim better, Tyler!" *He closed one eye and pulled the triggers, causing several more green fluoro bullets to blast towards Ridley.*

Pickles: *She struggled and watched the strings wrap around her ice swords, shattering them into nothing.* "Ougi-" *A dark spear suddenly shot up from the glyph and straight through her chest, causing her to fall to the ground.*

Ridley: *He lowered his arms and stood in a calm manner.* "There.."

Cameron: ".. They were captains, yet, he kills them without mercy-"

Tyler: *He overheard Cameron and frowned at him in response.* "Because he doesn't care about you!"

Apollo: (Why are you being so foolish?! This is not like you!)

Cameron: *He paused with shock and realisation.* "I-I, was manipulated-" *He paused again and looked at Tyler.* "So easily.. Tyler-"

Tyler: "It's fine, it's acceptable for now." *He spoke through gritted teeth.*

Cameron: *He nodded his head in a guilty manner and looked at the party, watching Lance, Season and PKMY lay on the ground.* "You three!"

Pickles: *Orbs floated from her fading arm and she turned around to face Brazza.* (He's gone-) *She looked up, watching white orbs float into the sky.* (I can't move body-)

Ridley: *He walked past Pickles as if she was no longer a threat.* "..."

Tyler: (Pain! Suffering!) *He shouted in thought with quivering lips, pulling the triggers on his handguns.*

Ridley: "..." *He smirked, blocking Tyler's bullets with his bare hand.*

Pickles: *She tilted her head down, causing her green hair to cover her face.* (I know my voice won't be heard, but... I leave everything to you all-)

PKMY: (I leave everything to you all-) *Pickles words echoed in her head.* (Everything.. To us?)

Holland: *He nudged PKMY's shoulder in concern.* "Come on, Amy, get up!"

Lezard: *He watched Pickles slowly fade away into orbs of light.* "HEALING RINGS"

Pickles: (I can't feel my arms-) *She ignored Lezard's glyphic rings which materialised around her.*

Lezard: *He watched the rings spiral around Pickles, noticing the lack of holy-like glow around them.* (There's no light-)

Pickles: "..." *She closed her eyes with a smile, suddenly bursting into tiny white orbs.*

Lezard: "Blast it-" *He mumbled to himself and focused his attention back to Ridley.* (I'm sorry father and mother monster, that's two people I couldn't save!)

Tyler: *He started to look frightened as Ridley slowly approached him.* (My bullets, he's blocking them with his bare hands!)

Ridley: "I've seriously grown tired of all this violence you kids seem to bestow upon me."

Tyler: "W-Why don't you stop?"

Ridley: *He stopped and looked at Tyler in shock, as if he was insulted.* "That's a very silly thing to spout." *He smiled and raised his hand.* "Farewell, Tyler-"

Tyler: *He lowered his arms and tightly held onto the handguns, noticing a shade of blue glow around Ridley.* "No-"

Ridley: "Crimson Shade." *Black and red lightning sparked above Tyler before blasting down towards him.*

Cameron: *He flashstepped in the air above Tyler with a smile.* (How foolish I was-)

Ridley: "Oh?"

Cameron: "Argh-" *He grunted in pain, as the black and red lightning struck into his back.*

Tyler: *He looked up in shock.* "C-Cameron!-"

Ridley: "Well, this is touching-"

Lezard: *He grabbed his cone-shaped hat and hobbled up to Holland, Freya, PKMY, Lance and Season.* "Everyone, Tyler has no Neurons or Astragons, so please explain to Lezard why he's the only one fighting?!"

Lance: *He shook his head and slowly stood up.* "Dude, he messed with my head big time." *He felt his head, feeling slightly ashamed.*

Season: "My city, my people-" *The flashes of lightning caught his attention, causing him to look up.*

Tyler: *He watched Cameron blast heavily on to the ground, causing him to twitch in fright.* "..."

Cameron: "Oof-" *He rolled across the ground and lay motionless, as a small flame burnt his cape.*

Lezard: "With the divine power of the holy spirits, scattering light, HEALING RINGS" *He focused his attention on Cameron, as bright rings of light materialised around him.*

Holland: "Amy?"

PKMY: "I-I will be fine, g-get him." *She touched her chest and spoke in an unsure manner.* (The surge of emotions, I can't shake it, the feeling, it is so intense I am literally having trouble moving my body-)

Lance: *He glared at Ridley, as confidence and anger started to fill his body.* (That bastard.)

Ridley: *He glanced at the Spacial Funnel, as he started to walk towards the party.* "I'm flattered you all came to celebrate the awakening of my plan. But really, there's no need to get too excited."

Holland: *He ran towards Ridley and formed fists.* (Everyone, are you with me?!)

Freya, Destiny, Fryfry, Twotters: (Yes!) *Their voices echoed in Holland's mind, boosting his morale.*

Holland: "Hi-Ougi."

Ridley: *He stopped, looking at Holland.* "I'm sorry, did you say hi, Hi-Ougi?"

Tyler: (Phew, he's no longer interested in me-)

Holland: *A yellow, light red and a grey glyph spiralled above him.* "Go!"

Destiny: *She dived out of the glyph and flew towards Ridley.* "Meeheheehe."

Ridley: "A Scoldrant? Oh ridiculous-" *He straightened his arm.* "NIGHTSHADE" *A stream of black lightning blasted past Destiny and towards Holland.*

Destiny: "Meehehe-" *She quickly flapped away, avoiding the black lightning.*

Holland: *His eyes widened.* "Fryfry!-"

Fryfry: (Myrror Shield.) *A red glass-like shield blocked the black lightning in front of Holland.*

Holland: (Time to get started-)

Destiny: *She reacted to Holland's thought, causing her to suddenly fly high into the air.* (Okay-)

Holland: "Winds howl and swirl with your might-" *Destiny flapped her wings, causing a tornado-like gale to swirl around Ridley.*

Ridley: "You delay what is obviously going to happen." *He sighed with boredom as the howling gale swirled around him.*

Holland: "Flashes come before me and slice-" *Destiny disintegrated and Fryfry materialised above and under Ridley.*

Ridley: "Am I meant to be impressed? Scoldrant Users are fascinating, but they're weak in comparison to-"

Holland: *The swarm became bright and flew at high speeds, causing lines of light to slash Ridley.* (Show him we aren't weak! We're just as strong as everyone else!)

Ridley: *He noticed thin, needle-like cuts on his arms, causing him to whack nearby fireflies away.* "Pests-"

Holland: "Humph-" *He stepped to the side and lined himself up with Ridley, watching the fireflies disintegrate into the air.*

Freya: *She glided above Holland.* (Ready-)

Twotters: *She pounced out of the glyph and high into the air above Holland.* (You there-?)

Freya: (Yes, I got you-) *She flew under Twotters, spreading her wings.*

Twotters: "Meow-" *She landed on Freya's back, looking down to Ridley.*

Ridley: *His hair flapped in a circular motion, as he looked at the wind with a tired expression.* "Have you finished? I promise to make your death quick-"

Holland: "Sound waves erupt the ground and explode-" *Twotters released a high-frequency screech, causing the ground to explode underneath Ridley.*

Ridley: "Oh dear?" *He looked down to his feet in shock.*

Holland: "Follow by your epic down-ward waves of fire-"

Freya: *She flew above Ridley who was trapped in the tornado.* "Grrr-" *Fire swirled around her back and formed wings.*

Twotters: (Harmonic Pulsar.) *Her whiskers touched, causing swirls of visible sounds to ripple in front of her.*

Freya: *She flapped down, causing a volcanic-like eruption to blast downwards.* (Combine!-) *The violin-like sounds blasted downwards with the fire and crashed on top of Ridley.*

Holland: (With all of you by my side-) *He sprinted towards Ridley as the fiery tornado died down.* (The power of your Screaming Gale, Notorious Twilight, Frenzy Symphony and Sonic Roar-)

*Holland glared at Ridley and ran into striking distance, raising his fist.*

Ridley: *He stepped forward, waving fire away from him.* "I wasn't expecting-" *He looked up, noticing Holland's fist.*

Holland: "SUMMONCE COMBO" *He punched directly onto Ridley's chest, causing a massive howling-like screech to echo the air around him.*

Ridley: "Argh-" *His hair rapidly moved back and he slowly tilted his head down.* (What is-?) *He watched sparks of firefly-like light, swirl around Holland's fist.* "A mere man cannot use power like this-"

Holland: "I'm a Scoldrant User." *He grunted and yelled, pushing his fist forward.*

*A red flash blasted Ridley back and exploded the ground around him, blowing dirt and grass into the air.*

Ridley: *His feet scraped along the ground.* (Impressive.)

Holland: *He panted and held his throat, causing Twotters and Freya to disintegrate into nothing.* (I think that might've hurt him-) *The dirt faded and revealed Ridley standing on the spot with a big grin on his face.*

Ridley: "That was spectacular, but I'll have to show you what a real punch is."

Holland: "How-? How are you still standing after that?"

Ridley: "Merely by standing on my feet after withstanding your incredible punch?" *He smirked with sarcasm.*

Holland: "You know what I mean!"

Ridley: "I've got a few tricks up my sleeve, but-" (Let's see how strong my Shadiatons are after being powered by the Radiatons-) *He chuckled to himself, knowing he was going to hurt Holland.*

Tyler: "Holland, get out of there!" *He kneeled on one knee and the handguns turned into liquid, forming over his shoulder into a bazooka.* "I'll get him-"

Holland: *He stared at Ridley and stepped back, proceeding to take Tyler's advice.* "I-"

Ridley: *He jumped forward and flashstepped in front of Holland, forming a fist.* "Bloody Eruption."

Holland: "Crud!-"

Ridley: "Haha!" *He punched Holland in the gut and blood-like water exploded around his fist.*

Holland: "Urgh-" *He bent down and coughed out blood, glancing at Ridley in a helpless manner.*

Ridley: "What a pathetic expression on your face." *He nudged forward and a pulse of blood-like water blasted Holland into the air.*

Tyler: "Wha-?"
Lance: "Huh!" *He watched Holland fly past the party and hit the ground, violently rolling across the grass.*

PKMY: (Holly!-) *She intensely stared at the ground, covering her ears with a mixture of emotions.*

Ridley: *He clapped his hands and quickly glanced at the Spacial Funnel.* "Any more takers?" *He smirked, looking back to the party.*

Lance: "Yea, me!" *He puffed out his chest and lightning formed itself into a sword in his hand.*

Ridley: "Oh please-" *He smiled in appreciation, glancing at the Spacial Funnel again.* "I still have time it seems."

Lance: "Glad ya have time!-" *He yelled and flashstepped directly in front of Ridley, ramming the lightning directly towards his face.*

----------

Cassidy: "Why do you keep saying game over? It's childish and pathetic."

Sofia: *Her cold golden eyes widened with anger.* "Excuse me?"

Cassidy: "You heard me! Ougi." *He grabbed the staff and held it like a spear, preparing to throw it at Sofia.*

Sofia: "Hiyah!" *She twitched her wrist above her head and moved the whip, suddenly flicking it towards Cassidy.*

Lorilei: "Cassidy, it will be a critical!"

Cassidy: *He nodded his head in acknowledgement and closely observed the way the whip moved, readying to hit it away.* (The moment I knock her whip out of the way, I'll proceed to use my Ougi.) "Now-"

Sofia: *She giggled and vibrated her wrist, causing the whip to vanish.* "Haheahe."

Cassidy: "Huh?" *He changed his stance from offensive to defensive, looking around in confusion.*

Sofia: (Gotcha again.)

Cassidy: (The whip lost its image-) *His arm tugged, which caused him to notice the whip wrapping itself around his wrist.*

Lorilei: (Her speed and power has increased-)

Sofia: *She glanced at the staff in Cassidy's hand, as a shade of blue glowed around her body.* "Imperial's Right."

*The whip violently zigzagged from the handle and curled up towards the end, suddenly ripping off Cassidy's arm.*

Cassidy: "Argh!"

Lorilei: "Cassidy!" *A blue glyph shined under her feet.*

Cassidy: *He frowned in pain, holding the staff in a defensive manner.* (What a cheap trick-)

Sofia: "Sticky Smash." *She flicked the whip above her, motioning her abdomen in a sexual manner.* "Here we go-"

*Sofia lunged her arm forward, causing the whip to wrap itself around Cassidy's staff.*

Cassidy: *He looked at the staff and tried to pull Sofia towards him.* "I'll finish you!"

Sofia: "Hahe." *She flicked her wrist as if she pulled back a fishing rod and the staff flung out of Cassidy's grip.*

Cassidy: "No!-" *He watched the staff spiral into the distance behind Sofia.*

Sofia: "Hahe." *She waved her arm, snapping the whip to her side.* "You're in my striking range!"

Cassidy: "I may not have my weapon, but-"

Sofia: "Carasmic Swirl." *She hopped on her toes and spun around, causing the whip to spiral around her like a tornado.*

Cassidy: "Karh-" *The sounds of ripping fabric could be heard, as deep slash marks tore his clothes apart.*

Sofia: "Hehahe." *She watched smears of blood land on the ground around Cassidy with each whip.*

Lorilei: "AQUA LIQUID" *She slapped her hand across the air and a wave of water hit Sofia.*

Sofia: "Hah?" *She stumbled back onto her feet and stopped spiralling, spitting out water.*

Cassidy: "Argh-" *He watched blood gush out from his shoulder.* (My arm-)

Lorilei: "Cassidy, fly up and allow yourself time to heal!"

Sofia: "Come on, just come on." *She sung and laughed, suddenly jumping towards Cassidy.*

Cassidy: "Ougi! Harh."

Sofia: "I grow bored of you now." *Her cold eyes and tone sent shivers down Cassidy and Lorilei's back.*

Cassidy: "Smacking Platoon!" *He motioned his hand in a come here-like manner, causing the staff to spiral back towards Sofia's head.* (From behind, this will be a critical-)

Sofia: *Her eyes shined gold and suddenly turned black.* "Hehahe-" *The staff smashed into the back of her head, causing Cassidy to smile.*

Cassidy: "That's what overconfidence-" *The staff shattered behind Sofia's back and crumbled to the ground.* "W-W-What-?"

Lorilei: *She glanced at the broken pieces of Cassidy's staff on the ground in shock.* (That could not be possible-)

Sofia: "Whip Smack-" *She violently flicked the whip across Cassidy's face, causing deep slash marks to appear on his face.*

Cassidy: "Argh-" *He felt his face in shock.* (She only struck once yet I received many cuts-)

Sofia: "Crescent Snap." *She spun around and flicked the whip upwards.*

Cassidy: *He sidestepped to avoid the whip.* "..." *The whip altered course and whipped him under the chin, lifting him up off his feet.*

Sofia: "Ougi."

Lorilei: "Cassidy!-" *She looked up frozen with unexpected fear, watching blood drip on to the ground from Cassidy's body.*

Sofia: *The whip glowed red and suddenly vibrated.* "Blood pure like the ruby, divine leather- Take the power you need, Multi-Vein Snap."

Cassidy: *He gritted his teeth in pain, as he started to descend.* "Kargh-"

Sofia: "Hehahee-" *The handle of the whip sprouted another seven whips, which swirled around her.*

Lorilei: (There are eight whips in total?!)

Cassidy: "You won't get away with this, I promise you'll meet the mistress-"

Sofia: "Boring-" *The whips zigzagged like veins and shot into Cassidy's body, keeping him above the ground.*

Cassidy: "Kark-" *He gargled blood and his legs twitched.*

Sofia: (This technique steals the Neurons in whatever body it pierces and gives it to me. If I'm near maximum stamina, my lovely whip stores the energy for me when I need it. It's good to reiterate the battle rules so it's fresh in the mind!) *She giggled evil-like.*

Cassidy: "Kark-k-k." *He violently twitched in pain.*

Lorilei: "Cassidy!"

Sofia: "Game over." *She flicked her wrist and the whips ripped Cassidy's body to pieces.*

Lorilei: *She covered her mouth in disgust, watching clusters of white orbs float from Cassidy's body parts.* (You monster!)

Sofia: *She raised her arm and flicked the whip, causing it to become one.* "Looks like my Ougi finished. But, could you please thank Cassidy for the snack?"

Lorilei: "S-Snack?" *Her lips wobbled with anger and sorrow.* "T-Terrible-"

Sofia: *She sighed and rolled her eyes.* "Out of The Sacred Knights, you, Locki and Pepper were the only fascinating ones to watch. Do some fancy Grand Rostical, hahe?" *She blinked and revealed her golden coloured eyes.*

Lorilei: "I'll show you fancy Remenistal!"

Sofia: "Yay me." *She clapped her hands in excitement.*

Lorilei: *She closed her eyes and mumbled an incantation to herself.* "Defensive winds, swirl and soar, offensive gusts, grand winds blow throughout my spirit-"

Sofia: *She looked bored and ran her finger along the whip.* "This is getting boring! I wonder what your blood will taste like? Sweet I think-" *She flicked her wrist and the whip instantly wrapped itself around Lorilei's neck.*

Lorilei: "Karh-" *She opened her eyes in shock, instinctively grabbing the whip with both hands.*

Sofia: "Game over-" *A cluster of light shined in the distance, catching her attention.* (Behind the ferns?!) "Who's there!?"

*A pillar of ice shot up from the ground and slammed into Sofia's stomach, knocking her back.*

Lorilei: *The whip lost its grip, causing her to sigh in relief.* "Ah-"

*Celest and Alicia proudly stormed into the clearing, catching Sofia's attention.*

Celest: "Are you both-?" *She noticed Cassidy's remains before they disintegrated into tiny white orbs.*

Lorilei: "Sh-She's become much stronger than she was before." *She threw the whip on the ground and stepped back, rubbing her neck.*

Sofia: *She giggled and brushed ice off her stomach.* "Celest, it's a pleasure to meet you. Oh, and that girl I met back at that backwater village." *She smirked evil-like, glaring at Alicia and Celest.*

Celest: "Be on guard, Alicia, it seems she's awoken her divine powers." *She whispered to Alicia, as she stared at Sofia's golden eyes.*

Alicia: "R-Right."

Celest: *She raised her arm and a white sword materialised into her hand.* "Sofia, this cannot be tolerated."

Sofia: "I've heard that before." *She smirked and snapped the whip to her side, taking several steps towards Celest and Alicia.*

Lorilei: (She seems to have completely forgotten my presence?)

Alicia: (She's always been scary, but now there's something else about her-) *Sofia giggled, interrupting her train of thought.* (-That makes her even more frightening.)

Sofia: (As I did with Cassidy, I'll let them underestimate me, then I'll strike with my love's power-) *She smirked evil-like, biting her bottom lip with excitement.*

----------

Ridley: *His face lit up, as Lance's lightning sword came into contact to his nose.* "Ouch-" *He quickly grabbed the lightning with his hand, causing electricity to spark up his arm.*

Lance: *He looked shocked, staring at Ridley's hand with widening eyes.* (He's touching my lightnin' sword?!)

Ridley: "I'm impressed, your lightning is this sturdy." *He smiled in a calm manner, watching the electricity string up his arm.*

Lance: *He grunted and gritted his teeth, trying to ram the lightning sword into Ridley's face.* (I can't push it any further.)

Ridley: "How is your Remenistal doing this? Or is it an Azure Burst? Streaming Sword maybe?" *He tightened his grip on the lightning and formed a fist, causing it to splinter and spark away.*

Lance: "Huh?" *He bent forward in shock.*

Tyler: (No, Lance is open-) *The bazooka made a charging sound and suddenly clicked, causing him to aim it towards Ridley.*

Ridley: "Now it's your turn to say your farewells." *He smirked in Lance's face.*

Tyler: (Now!-) *He shot a large fluoro green ball at Ridley.*

Ridley: "Forceful sounds, radiate the ground, as deep as abyss, DARK STYX." *He pushed Lance back and pointed at the fluoro green ball, causing darkness to envelop it.*

Tyler: "Darkness?"

Ridley: *He stepped to the side, as the fluoro ball shot past him.* "You're aiming is good, you just lack experience-"

Tyler: (Missed!)

Ridley: "Here's a little life lesson, if you're ready to strike your foes then prepare to receive the same treatment" *He faced the ball and motioned his arms up.*

Tyler: *He watched the ball unnaturally alter course and fly into the air.* (He's manipulating it?!)

Lance: *He stood up straight and faced Ridley with a frown.* "I'm not the type to wait." *He straightened his arm at Ridley.*

Ridley: *He spun around and pointed at Tyler, motioning the ball towards him.* "I wonder if you can block this attack with your hands, too?"

Tyler: *He watched the ball shoot towards him.* "N-No-" *The bazooka disintegrated off his shoulder and he stood up in an urgent manner.*

Lance: *He watched lightning spark around his hand, causing him to slightly smirk.* "LIGHTNING BLAST"

Ridley: "ROTTING SWORD" *He threw his hand at Lance and a black sword puffed like smoke towards the lightning.*

Lance: *He noticed the black sword and quickly lowered his arm, stepping to the side.* "Tssk-" *The sword flew past, slashing the side of his arm.* "Arh-"

Season: *He ran up and stood in front of Tyler.* "Might, strength, fury, courage, form these emotions in array of mighty pillars, GROUND SHAKING" *A pillar of rock erupted in front of him and an explosion of green light exploded it into a scattering debris cloud.*

Tyler: *He squinted his eyes and covered his face with his arms, as pieces of rock flew past.* (Season.)

*Trails of dirt wafted past Season and particles of green light disintegrated into the air.*

Season: "I was not expecting him to use mind tricks, I won't let my guard down this time." *He grunted with confidence and raised his arm over his shoulder, grabbing hold of something.*

Lance: "NIGHTSHADE"

Ridley: *His eyes widened and he kicked the ground, causing him to slide back.* "NIGHTSHADE"

Lance: "Harh!-" *He pushed forward, blasting a stream of black lightning from his hand.*

Ridley: "Hmm." *He casually raised his arm and a blast of black lightning streamed towards Lance.*

*The two streams of lightning collided and instantly started to push Lance back.*

Lance: "A-Argh." *He grunted and slid back, watching Ridley's lightning consume his.*

Ridley: (Now, to add a little more Neurons-) *He twitched his finger, causing Lance's lightning to suddenly break and scatter.*

Lezard: *He watched Lance's lightning flash into nothing, causing Ridley's lightning to blast towards him.* "Lance! Sidestep away from it now!-"

Lance: "G-Gah-" *He gasped and flashstepped to the side, watching the black lightning stream past his face in fright.*

Ridley: "Oh, so close." *He smiled, lowering his arm in confidence.* "Your Nightshade had no chance against mine-"

Season: "Fierceful storms, rain from the divine spirit of purity, power of the beast roaring through the waves, lend me your strength-" *He stamped his foot on the ground, causing water to spurt around his foot.*

Ridley: *He looked back, watching a massive wave of blue water erupt behind him.* "Oh, water? This technique is very easy to avoid-"

Lance: "Oi!" *He shouted, drawing Ridley's attention back in front.*

Ridley: "It's Ridley."

Lance: "Roar with the skies might-"

Season: "AQUATIC DIVIDER"
Lance: "THUNDER BOOM" *He spread his arms and clapped, causing the grass to blow forward towards Ridley.*

Ridley: "Hmm?" *He stared at Lance, raising his hand to defend himself.*

Lance: "You're going to need more than your hand against me, shard nugget!-"

Ridley: *A sudden gust of wind pushed him back, causing him to smirk with disappointment.* "Is that it-?" *Loud thunder clashed and blasted him back off his feet.* "What-?!"

Season: (Good work, Lance-) *He stamped his foot again and another wave erupted in the air in front of Ridley.*

Lezard: *He stared at Ridley from the side, watching two powerful walls of water grow in size.* (He's trapped-)

Lance: (I can't see-) *He frowned, staring at the wave of gushing water.*

Ridley: *He slid back on the grass and slightly bent his knees, causing him to instantly stop.* "Crushing me with water? Really-?"

Season: *He clapped his hands and the waves rumbled towards each other.* "Yes-" *An explosion of high pressured water crashed around Ridley.*

Lance: *Water rained down on top him, causing him to slightly step back.* (Did that get him?) *He watched the violent water suddenly lose its current and splash on to the ground.*

Ridley: *He stood on the spot awkwardly and collapsed to his knees, watching water drip from his hair.* "I, I think that got me."

Season: "Yes." *He whispered to himself.*

Lance: "Ahah, yeah!-"

Ridley: "Joking-" *He stood up with a smirk and faced Season.*

Lance: (Jokin'?) *His eye twitched with anger.*

Ridley: "What a powerful Remenistal User you are."

Season: (I put a lot of Neurons into that Rostical!-)

Lance: "What a powerful person you are-" *He sarcastically grunted with anger.* "Get over yourself, aye!"

Ridley: *He glanced towards Lance, watching his image disappear.* "Hmm-?"

Lance: *He flashstepped beside Ridley, violently grabbing his arm.* "Avoid this, you're soakin'!-"

Ridley: "I grow ridiculously tired of you."

Lance: "LIGHTNING CHAIN BLAST"

*Fluoro yellow lightning sparked up Ridley's arm, causing him to grit his teeth.*

Ridley: (I can't move?) *He frowned at Lance, uncontrollably twitching with each spark of lightning.*

Lance: *He noticed the lightning spark down his hand, causing his eyes to twitch in pain.* "H-How can you grow bored of this?" *He spoke through gritted teeth and smirked.*

Ridley: "I'm sure you might remember this Grand Remenistal, Lance." *He smirked and shook his head with slight excitement, trying to overcome the lightning.*

Lance: "Who cares! Arhh!" *He yelled, causing swirls of lightning to string in a large area around him.*

Season: *He cautiously stepped back, watching the lightning move in a fluid manner.* "...-"

Ridley: (His Neurons!-)

*Strings of lightning sparked through Ridley and Lance's body, causing them to twitch in pain.*

Lance: (The water, my lightning's gettin' me, too!-)

Ridley: *His mouth opened in pain, as his body violently twitched.* "A-Argh-"

Lance: *He coughed up blood and let go of Ridley's arm, causing the lightning to scatter away.* "Th-There-" *He sighed and stepped back, as lightning jumped in the puddles around him.*

Ridley: "Hahaha." *His body suddenly puffed like smoke, causing Lance to gasp.*

Season: (A copy?!)

Lance: *He frowned, ignoring slight vein-like burns on his arm.* (Dammit-)

Ridley: "Splendid, simply superb." *His voice echoed in the area, causing Lance to glance to each side.*

Lance: "Where?"

Season: "Behind you!"

Lance: *He quickly spun around, noticing Ridley appear in a puff of smoke.* (Shit-)

Ridley: *He smiled at Lance, clapping his hands in an impressed manner.* "That wasn't a standard Remenistal, did you create it?"

Lance: "Shut up!" *He straightened his arm at Ridley and focused, causing a pulse of wet grass to blow away from him.* "LIGHTNING-"

Ridley: *He suddenly flashstepped in front of Lance and stamped on his foot, punching his arm away.* "Hmph." *He kneed Lance in the chest and punched him across the face, slashing a black sword across his face.*

Lance: "Shit-" *He fell to the side and noticed a slash-like stream of smoke sway from Ridley's materialising sword.*

Ridley: *He stepped back and kicked Lance off his feet, before punching him onto the ground.* "Despite fading my existence, your lightning hurt-"

Lance: *He coughed, looking up at Ridley with a cocky smirk.* "Good."

Ridley: "Rude." *He spoke with a frown and violently stamped on Lance's chest, pointing the sword in his face.*

Season: "FLURRY STYX" *He pushed forward, blasting a ball of visible wind towards Ridley.*

Ridley: *He looked to the side and moved his sword in a defensive manner, blocking the ball of wind.* "Season-"

Lance: *He coughed and tried to breathe, attempting to punch Ridley's feet off his chest.* (Get off me!)

Ridley: *His hair blew back, as he watched the ball of wind violently scrape against his sword.* "I recommend you use your incantations-"

Season: "Your advice has been heard.. Thank you." *He spoke in a condescending manner.*

Lance: "THUNDER BOOM"

Ridley: *He gasped with widening eyes, looking down to his feet.* "You-"

Lance: "Hah!" *He clapped his hand and pushed Ridley back with an echoing thunder.*

Ridley: *He slid back and shook his head, clicking his fingers around his ears.* "How pitiful-"

*A massive pillar of rock slammed into Ridley's chest, causing his sword to puff into smoke.*

Season: "GROUND SHAKING"

Lance: *He stood back up and cracked his neck, intensely staring at Ridley.* (That, dickhead.)

Ridley: *He swayed to the side, bursting the rock pillar into sand.* "I'll get straight to it. NIGHTSHADE LANCE"

Tyler: *He looked behind him, observing the party members.* (Lezard is focusing on healing Cameron and Holland, PKMY seems to be regaining her consciousness-)

Lance: (Nightshade Lance, where have I heard that before-?)

Ridley: "He acquired a taste of my power-"

Lance: "Shut it." *He grunted and ignored Ridley, rubbing the vein-like burns in pain.* (I took that damage for nothin'-)

*Dark strings suddenly shot up from the ground and wrapped themselves around Lance, causing him to wheeze in pain.*

Lance: *He stared at the dark strings, gasping in recollection.* (I remember this!)

Ridley: *He discreetly looked up and watched the clouds spiral around a plummeting black spear.* "Unlike Demonic Siovance, you won't be able to break yourself free-"

Tyler: *He looked up and noticed the spear.* "Season!"

Season: "I know-" *He stared at Lance with desperation.* "Endure the piercing sounds, hurricanes might, ball of force-"

Lance: "I-I can't-" *He gritted his teeth, trying to break free from the strings.*

Season: "FLURRY STYX"

Ridley: "..." *He silently stared at Lance, watching him struggle with anticipation.*

*A visible ball of wind grew and expanded in front of Season, causing his hair to blow to each side.*

Season: "Harh!" *He pushed forward, shooting the ball of wind towards Lance.*

Lance: *The black strings made stretching sounds, as they tightened around his arms and legs.* (These things stretch, I can't break-) "Damn you-"

*A blast of wind suddenly hit Lance in the back and exploded, pushing him across the ground.*

Ridley: *He watched the strings snap before the spear plummeted into the ground, causing it to crack and rumble.* "Well, I wasn't expecting that to happen."

Lance: "Tssk-" *He slid on the ground, squinting his eyes in pain and shock.*

Tyler: (Season knocked Lance out of the way! How smart-)

Season: "It's not good for a full-fledged Rostical User to go on the offensive frontline." *He walked towards Ridley, away from the party.*

Tyler: "S-Season?"

Season: "But, mastering vast amounts of differently-styled Rostical, I'll be able to hold my own."

Ridley: *He looked at Season with a smile.* "Seeking revenge because I destroyed your precious city?"

Season: "I personally believe you're bluffing-" *He looked back to Cameron.* "It wouldn't be the first time you lied."

Ridley: *He closed his eyes with confidence, preparing to give Season a speech.* "Exactly-"

*Ridley opened his eyes and gasped, as a storm of ice shards erupted up around him.*

Ridley: "A-Ah!?" *Small thin cuts formed around his hands.*

Season: *Sparks scattered around a large red trident, which stood taller than him.* "-FRIGID STORM"

Ridley: "You-"

Season: "Smear upon the skies, blue waves crashing down, LIGHTNING BLAST" *He pointed his trident and a massive swirl of lightning blasted towards Ridley, blowing the surrounding grass away.*

Ridley: "Useless, once again. Must I repeat myself-?"

Season: "Ground and water draw each other's power, liquefy and harden, LIFA BLOSSOM"

Ridley: *He straightened his arm and blocked the blast of lightning, blowing his hair back.* "Hermm?" *He looked down and paid attention to the rumbling ground around him.*

Season: "Lightning pulse like veins, true power recharge and discharge and flow through the easiest current-" *Lightning scattered like veins in the air above Ridley.*

Ridley: *His arm twitched, as he continued to block the lightning.* "I can't hear you, speak up?"

Season: "..." *He hit the ground with the bottom of the trident, causing the dirt to harden and crack underneath Ridley.*

Ridley: *He frowned and focused, causing shadow to envelop Season's lightning.* "DARK STYX"

*Ridley swayed to the side, pushing the thick stream of lightning past him.*

Ridley: (The Rasticsplash behind that Lightning Blast was high up.)

Tyler: *He stared at Season, covering his mouth in amazement.* (Oh my gosh.)

Ridley: *He looked back down, drawn to the sounds of hardening stone.* "What is this-?"

*A massive large tree erupted out of the ground and sprouted up, lifting Ridley into the air.*

Ridley: "Blast it-" *Branches trapped his arms, as the tree continued to grow and widen.*

Season: "LIGHTNING STRIKE" *He waved the trident downwards and a blast of lightning fell from the sky, sparking through Ridley.*

Ridley: "A-Arh!-" *The leaves and branches around him caught on fire, catching PKMY's attention.*

PKMY: *She panted heavily, watching the fire flicker in the tree.* "Season..."

Tyler: (I have a bad feeling-) *He squealed in thought, focusing his attention towards the party.* "Lezard, please help out Season!"

Lezard: "Oh?" *He looked over his shoulder, causing the bangles to sway from his hat.*

Tyler: "I have heaps of Acro Berries in the RPG bag!" *He reached into the bag and ran towards Holland, who was still unconscious.*

Lezard: "Alright!" *He lowered his arms, causing rings of light to stop spiralling around Holland and Cameron.*

Lance: *He curled up in a ball on the ground, groaning for air.* (I can't breathe.. Somethin' winded me-)

Season: "My Rostical explodes deep in the hot abyss, with the seraphic blood I wish to end this battle! DIMENSION CRISIS" *He spun around and pointed the trident at the burning tree.*

Ridley: *He grunted in pain, as small strings of electricity ran between him and the nearby branches.* (What a combo-)

Season: "Harh!" *He flicked the trident and an enormous purple firework-like explosion rippled and exploded the tree into a massive pulse.*

Ridley: "Ah-" *The tree, fire and purple firework disintegrated into the air.* "What was that-?" *He mumbled under his breath and became limp, collapsing onto the ground.*

Lezard: *He held his cone-shaped hat and looked at Season, standing in a defensive manner.* "I'm here to help you out."

Season: *He glanced over to the twitching Lance.* "Please heal him for the moment."

Lezard: "O-Okies." *He nodded his head in respect and faced Lance, raising his arms.* "HEALING RINGS"

Ridley: "Hahaha." *He placed his hands firm on the ground and slowly straightened his arms.* "Marvellous, simply superb." *He grunted, as he lifted himself up in pain.*

Season: (He's grown much weaker?) *He mumbled in confusion and looked up, noticing the moon slowly glow red.* (Perhaps it's weakening him-)

Ridley: "Hahaha! I will use the full extent of my shadow affinity!" *He grunted in anger as his fists suddenly enveloped with shadow.*

Season: (How he stands up after receiving one of my best combos amazes me.) *He raised the trident above his head.* "Taste the power of crushing currents, devour the sacred waters-"

Ridley: *He flashstepped face to face with Season, causing him to stop his incantation.* "Sword of arts, this sword is the start, rot and decay, haste and make no delay-"

*Ridley adjusted his fingers as if he was holding a sword, gently placing it against Season's chest.*

Ridley: "ROTTING SWORD"

Season: "Karh?" *He wheezed and looked down, as a black sword materialised through his chest and out his back.*

PKMY: *She tightly held her chest with a dropping jaw.* "Season?!"

Tyler: *He leant over Holland with a handful of Acro Berries and stopped, listening to PKMY scream.* "PKMY-?"

PKMY: "No!" *She screamed at Ridley, causing Tyler to look.*

Tyler: "S-" *He gasped in despair, staring at the sword with widening eyes.* "Season!"

Ridley: *His eyes glowed yellow.* "I haven't released this much darkness in a while."

Season: *Blood dripped down the side of his mouth.* "HOLARH RWARE"

Ridley: *He tilted his head in confusion and leant closer to Season, smiling in a confident manner.* "I beg your pardon, what did you say, your final words?"

Season: "S-SOLAR FLARE"

Ridley: "What-?" *He leant back with widening eyes.* "-Did you say!?" *He looked down and noticed the trident touching his stomach.*

Season: *He coughed and smiled in pain.* "Heard me?" *He wheezed out the words, as clusters of light shined in between them.*

----------

Sofia: "I'm getting excited, ladies." *She licked her lips, staring at Lorilei, Alicia and Celest.*

Celest: *She pointed the white sword at Sofia.* "Time to repent!"

Sofia: "Sure-"

Alicia: "ICICLE EDGE" *She waved downwards and a shower of ice spears instantly blasted down in front of her towards Sofia.*

Sofia: "Yee harh!" *She spun around and flicked the whip above her, shattering the ice spears in one stroke.* "Is that all you got? Seriously? Hahehae-"

Lorilei: "FLAME BOLT" *She cupped her hands and pushed forward, shooting eight fireballs at Sofia.*

Sofia: "Tssk, now this is getting fun." *She skipped towards Lorilei and swirled the whip above her.* "Haheha." *She sliced the fireball in several halves, causing her to giggle in an evil-like manner.*

Celest: *She suddenly appeared in front of Sofia shrouded by a cluster of light, lunging the sword upwards.* "Horh."

Sofia: "Harh." *She looked down and quickly tilted her head back, as Celest's sword scratched her chin.* "Ouch-"

Alicia: *She cupped her hands and a blue glyph shined underneath her feet.* "POLAR SNAP"

Celest: *She spun around, stepping back from Sofia.* "Cerenity Wave."

Sofia: *She slowly tilted her head forward, glaring at Celest with an excited smirk.* "Hahe."

Celest: *She waved her arms towards Sofia, slicing two waves of white light.* "Hermph."

Sofia: *She watched the light slice past her face, causing her to giggle in ecstasy.* "Wow-"

Celest: *She smirked, watching the light dissipate around Sofia's cheeks.* "Not used to a high-level Radiaton-based Azure Burst, are you?"

Sofia: *Two thin cuts appeared on both sides of her face.* "Hahehaha-" *Snow swirled and clustered around her head before exploding into a large chunk of ice.*

Lorilei: "Turn to dust and sand, watch it vacuum your sins, SWIRLING SANDPIT" *She focused her attention to the rocky cliff, causing its hard appearance to slowly warp into sand.*

Sofia: *She flicked her wrist and the whip smashed the ice surrounding her face.* "Arh-"

Celest: *She threw the white sword into the air and pulled her hand back.* "ARCADIC PULSARE"

Alicia: "FREEZING HOLLOWS" *She leant forward and blew out a pulse of mist, instantly freezing Sofia's whip.*

Sofia: *She swayed her arm towards Celest, trying to flick the whip.* "Hah?"

Celest: "Hermph." *She punched forward and a gust of white aura took form of a hand, suddenly grabbing Sofia around the chest.*

Sofia: "Ah-?" *She noticed her feet had started to sink into the sand below.*

Alicia: "Kiss the rain, WATER STORM" *A blue glyph drew itself underneath her and she motioned her arms upwards.*

Sofia: "Haheha-" *A blast of water slammed into her chest, causing her to wheeze and cough.*

Celest: *She tightened her hand, causing the aura to apply more pressure around Sofia.* "Lorilei, Alicia, use a sharp, multi-based attack, now."

Alicia: "N-Now?"

Lorilei: "We must take advantage of her bound-like state."

Celest: "..." *She nodded her head as she continued to apply more pressure on the aura-made hand.*

Sofia: *She heard stretching leather and looked down, watching the aura tighten around her chest.* (It's a tight fit-)

Celest: "Aliciana!"

Alicia: "O-Okay!" (Something piercing and multi-based? Got it!-) "Unwritten holy laws, strike down my foe-"

Lorilei: *A green glyph spiralled around her feet.* "HOWLING GALES"

Alicia: "SHINING RAIN" *She raised her hands and focused, causing spears of light to move like razor blades above Sofia.*

Lorilei: *The glyph disintegrated and visible waves of wind sliced the air towards Sofia.* (This will be her end.)

Sofia: *She frowned in struggle and looked up, hiding her fear.* (This isn't good-)

*Black and white radiant wings blasted out from Sofia's back, ripping Celest's aura-based hand apart.*

Celest: "Argh-" *She held her hand in pain, as blood ran down a cut.* (She broke free by using the force of her wings!)

Sofia: "How's the recoil damage, Celest? Hahehahe-" *She slowly lifted herself out of the sand, catching Lorilei's attention.*

Lorilei: *She stared at Sofia's wings in shock.* (Black and white?!)

Celest: "Aliciana!"

Alicia: "Y-Yes!" *She swayed her arm down, blasting the spears at Sofia.*

Sofia: *She stood on her toes and spiralled around, avoiding the spears of light.* "Haheha."

Alicia: *She watched the spears stab into the ground and sink into the sand around Sofia.* (Missed-)

Sofia: "Come and get me!" *She looked up and blasted high into the air, causing a large swirl of sand to spiral where she stood.*

Alicia: *She looked up, as Sofia's image appeared like a dot in the sky.* "W-What are we going to do?"

Celest: *She dragged one foot forward, as silver radiant wings exploded from her back.* "It's obvious."

Alicia: "...-"

Celest: "Chase after her, of course-" *She bent her knees and looked up, suddenly blasting off the ground and into the air.*

Lorilei: *She focused, causing her wings to warp and materialise behind her back.* "Aliciana, was it?"

Alicia: *She looked confused, glancing at Lorilei.* "Please call me Alicia."

Lorilei: "Come on-" *She flapped her wings and looked up, suddenly flying high into the air.*

Alicia: (We're going to fight in the sky?) *She looked scared with a slight smirk, as two massive wings of radiant light exploded from her back.*

*Alicia looked up in determination, as her wings lit up the area around her.*

Alicia: "I-I'm coming-" *She blasted high into the air at incredible speeds, quickly flying past Lorilei.* "Let's get her-"

Lorilei: (She's fast!) *She looked ahead, staring at Alicia's magnificent wings.*

----------

Season: (At this range, Solar Flare should rip his body to pieces-) *He looked at the trident, causing him to chuckle.*

Ridley: "You sneaky bastard-"

*A beam of white light with fluoro blue shading blasted straight through Ridley and into the distance.*

Ridley: *He gasped and let go of the black sword, listening to the sounds of his robes rip around the beam of light.* "A-Argh!"

Season: *He coughed out blood and watched the sword puff into smoke, allowing him to stumble backwards.* (It hurts-)

Lezard: *He leant over Lance and spread his arms, watching white light pour into Lance's body.* (This silly sausage kept moving out of my Healing Rings, so it's easier to heal him close range.)

*An echoing, whoosh-like sound hummed through the air, causing Lezard to look up in curiosity.*

Lezard: "What-?" *He spoke under his breath, watching the bright beam pulse through Ridley and across the land.*

Season: *He buckled at the knees and grabbed the trident with both hands, using it to support himself.* "Did you enjoy my Grand Rostical?"

Ridley: *The beam's size shrunk before it faded into particles of blue twinkles.* "Argh-" *He hunched forward in pain, covering a large hole in his stomach with both hands.*

Season: "I've created something stronger, another variant of the Rostical you encountered before."

Ridley: "What-ck are you babbling about?" *He groaned under his breath, struggling to keep eye contact with Season.*

Season: "I-I.. Will show you."

Ridley: *He closed his eyes.* (I will confront whatever power he says he possesses. Then, I'll unleash the other side...)

Tyler: (How can Ridley stand with such a ridiculous wound?)

Ridley: (The same power that killed Teresa Seraph, and, that experimental number one, Jewel..) *He slightly smirked to himself and opened his eyes, watching blood run down his hand.*

Season: "My Rostical explodes deep in the hot abyss-" *He grunted, raising the trident above his head.*

Ridley: (That incantation?)

*Ridley had a flashback of the purple firework which exploded the tree in a pulse.*

Ridley: (That was a powerful move, but he has already used that. Maybe the damage has affected his memory-?) "Hahaha."

Season: "Grander than the seven stars of The Astral Plains, blast, ignite, brighten the area with your spectacular array-"

PKMY: *She looked around, noticing the area become pitch black.* (I haven't seen you use this before, Season-)

Season: "I shall a-tear your insignificant bonds, with the seraphic blood, this battle will finish!-" *Rings of purple glyphs spiralled all around his body, blowing his hair and robes to each side.*

Tyler: *He stared at the purple lights which shined brightly off the glyphs around Season.* (What kind of Rostical is this?)

Ridley: *His hair blow back, as he stared at the purple glyphs in a worried manner.* (That pure level of Neurons he's gathering, it's actually a growing worry-)

Season: *He grunted and pointed the trident at Ridley, causing him to lean on one side.* "DIMENSION CASCADIA"

Ridley: "Dimension Cascadia?" *He bent at the knees and braced himself.* (It would be foolish to flashstep now, I've seen incidents where the Rasticsplash alone ripped warrior's limbs off-)

Season: (If Ridley decides to withstand this Rostical, it will blast him into pieces-) *Sweat ran down his face.* (And if he flashsteps, then he'll be torn apart-)

Ridley: (He's already wounded, maybe his attack won't-?) *A purple firework-like explosion blasted above him, causing him to instantly slam face-first into the ground.*

Lance: *He mumbled and leant up, noticing his arms completely healed.* "I feel heaps better-"

*Lance grumbled in appreciation to Lezard and focused his attention on Season, noticing purple sparklers flash in the air.* "Everything is black? Is it a Grand Rostickal? What have I missed?"

Lezard: "Season has prepared an unusual Remenistal-"

*Blasts of red, orange and purple fireworks exploded all around Ridley, causing thunder-like rumbles to echo from the explosions.*

Season: *He dropped to his knees and panted, supporting himself off the trident.* (I have not witnessed anything surviving that devastating Rostical-)

*The watching party members noticed the area revert back to normal, leaving a multi-coloured smoke cloud around Ridley.*

Lezard: "That was a delicious Remenistal, even Ginger would've been jealous over it.." *He spoke to Lance, watching the smoke cloud waft away.*

Ridley: *He awkwardly stood on the spot with an arm torn off.* "That, was, unexpected, Season."

PKMY: *Her eyes widened in disbelief.* (How?)

Season: "You still stand? Despite-" *He took a deep breath of exhaustion.* "Despite your shadow affinity, there is nothing special about you-"

Ridley: "On the contrary-" *He stood up straight and revealed the hole in his stomach completely healed.*

Lezard: *He watched Ridley spin around, purposely revealing his healed wound to the party.* (That hole from Season's Solar Flare, it's completely sealed up?!)

Tyler: "How can he-?"

Holland: *He grunted, as he slowly awakened.* "T-Tyler?"

Tyler: "Take it easy for a-a bit-" *He looked back to Holland, smiling in a caring manner.* "Let the items I used on you course through your body."

Holland: *He nodded his head in understanding.* "Thanks, Tyler."

Season: "On the contrary?" *He wheezed each word, looking at Ridley with double vision.*

Ridley: "I'll show you why I'm special." *He closed his eyes and smirked.*

PKMY: *She closely observed Ridley and looked surprised.* (Something about his aura has changed-)

Ridley: "What makes me special, is-" *He slowly opened his eyes, as veins and bones shot out from his missing arm.*

Lance: "Huh?" *He watched the veins and bones form themselves into a skinless arm.*

Ridley: "Haha, I have the power of light-" *His golden eyes shined at Season, as skin covered the flesh and started to form an arm.*

Season: "What-?" *He stared at Ridley's eyes in disbelief.*

Ridley: "Now that my wounds have healed-" *He looked down and formed a fist with a smirk.*

PKMY: "That smirk-" *He grunted to herself and gritted her teeth.*

Ridley: "Phew, it was good spending time with you, Season-" *He flashstepped face to face to Season and touched his neck.*

Season: *Blood ran down his chin and on to Ridley's hand.* "How, just... How?"

Ridley: "Can't comprehend my divine eyes?" *He giggled and looked at his newly healed hand.* "White ash, swirl with life and cause the opponent to halt, let the spirits fade, HOLYSHADE"

*Ridley's golden eyes shined and a stream of white lightning blasted through Season's neck.*

Season: "Kerhgh-" *He dropped the trident and stumbled back, causing PKMY, Tyler and Lance to shout in shock.*

Ridley: "Just fall already?" *He spoke on a sigh, lowering his arm in a confident manner.*

Season: "No-" *He whispered in a defeated manner and fell backwards.*

PKMY: *She flashstepped behind Season, catching him before he hit the ground.* (It would be stupid to ask if you are OK-)

Season: "..."

PKMY: (Dammit, Caesar.) *She looked at Season, staring at the burning flesh around his neck.*

Ridley: "Oh, PKMY, great work catching him-"

PKMY: "Shut your ugly face-"

Ridley: "When odds are against Sofia, she notices that if the party fights individually and not as a cohesive team she'll win the fight-"

PKMY: "I told you to shut up!" *She flashstepped, causing Season to hit the ground.*

Ridley: *He leant back startled and looked around.* (Where did she go?)

Tyler: "No.." *He gasped under his breath, staring at Season in shock.*

Lance: "Sh-Shit-" *He intensely stared at Season, quickly glancing at Lezard.* "G-Go, now."

Lezard: "R-Right." *He stood up and held his hat, awkwardly running towards Season.*

Ridley: *He glared at Lezard.* "You think I'll let you heal all these party members-?"

PKMY: *Her image appeared in front of Ridley in mid-air, causing him to lean back with widening eyes.* "Tssk-"

*PKMY motioned her arm back and punched in front, causing a pillar of ice to erupt in Ridley's face.*

PKMY: "GLACIA'S EDGE" *She landed on the ground with ease and raised her arm, revealing a Ryukku pierced through her hand.*

Ridley: *He stumbled back, as needles of ice splintered around his head.* "That-" *He violently rubbed his eyes with growing disorientation.*

PKMY: "Tssk-" *She ripped the Ryukku out of her hand and faced Ridley, walking towards him in a powerful-like manner.*

Ridley: *He covered one eye with his hand and gritted teeth, staring at PKMY.* "I was not expecting an incantation boosted Glacia's Edge to slam me in the face-"

PKMY: *She swayed her arm and a swirl of fire spiralled around Ridley.* "FLAMING WHEEL"

Ridley: *He glanced at the fire and looked surprised.* (It's boosted?) *The flames erupted high into the air around him, causing hot blasts of wind to blow in his face.*

PKMY: *She reached out and a spear of ice grew in her hand.* "ICICLE EDGE" *She threw it like a javelin towards the swirling fire.*

Ridley: (She's somehow able to boost her Remenistal without the incantation. Or perhaps, I'm underestimating her? She's also able to use different affinities-)

*An ice spear suddenly shot through the fire and directly towards Ridley, causing a spiral of mist to evaporate off it.*

Ridley: "Blasted, woman! I've never liked redheads-" *He raised his arm and backhanded the ice spear, causing it to shatter away.*

PKMY: *She stepped back, watching the last swirls of fire spiral around Ridley.* (I missed him?)

Ridley: "How are you doing that?"

PKMY: (My Ougi?) "Like I'm going to tell ya."

Lance: *He stood up and formed fists, causing rings of blue lightning to spark around his wrists.* "Oi, Docta Jingles! I'm helpin'!"

PKMY: *She looked at Lance in the corner of her eye.* "I won't complain."

Tyler: *He watched Season lay on the ground unconscious, frowning with watering eyes.* "You! Ougi! Mastered state of Alchemy and Crafting I show you-"

*White liquid spiralled out of the RPG bag and into Tyler's hands, forming two handguns.*

Tyler: "Ragnarok."

Holland: "Amy?" *He leant up, watching PKMY kick and punch towards Ridley.*

Ridley: *He quickly swayed to each side, barely avoiding PKMY's strikes.* "Fast-" *PKMY's fist flashed in front of his face, causing him to stumble back.*

PKMY: *She kicked across Ridley's head, causing him to duck.* "Tssk-"

Ridley: (She really is fast-) *He closely observed each of PKMY's limbs with his golden eyes.* (But these eyes can easily track physical movements to the slightest-)

PKMY: *She punched forward, causing Ridley to step to the side.* "You're slowing down, yahoo." *She bent down and quickly jumped into the air, causing Ridley to look up in confusion.*

Ridley: *He gasped with widening eyes.* "Dang-" *He quickly ducked, as a stream of lightning blasted above his head from behind.* "Lightning!?"

Lance: "-BLAST" *Lightning sparked around his arm, which was pointed at Ridley.*

Holland: *He stood up, holding his chest.* (That was so close.)

Tyler: "Arh!" *He pulled the triggers, watching fluoro green bullets shoot towards Ridley.*

Ridley: *He faced the direction of Tyler and frowned, blocking the bullets with his hands.* "Not this game again-"

PKMY: *She dived directly in front of Ridley, stabbing the ground with her Ryukku.* "Heh-" *She looked up and smirked, as a deep cut slashed Ridley down the face.*

Ridley: *Small bullet-like holes of fabric suddenly blasted off his shoulder and into the air.* "Blast?!"

Lance: "Nice!" *He smirked at Tyler in the distance and formed a fist, causing more blue lightning to swirl around it.*

Ridley: *He frowned and looked at his shoulder, noticing green, mist-like residue sway from the bullet holes.* "You-"

Tyler: (Finally got him!) *He frowned in determination and continued to pull on the triggers, shooting more fluoro green bullets at Ridley.*

Lance: "LIGHTNING-"

Ridley: "That's quite enough! My Grand Remenistal came to me thanks to the power of light!"

PKMY: "Light-" *She spiralled the Ryukku in her hand and threw it into the air.* "Lance, move back-" *She backflipped away from Ridley, giving herself distance from him.*

Ridley: *He raised his arms, as his wounds closed and healed themselves.* "ORPHAN'S CRADLE" *A cluster of soft appearing orbs floated in the air from his hands.*

Lezard: "What are they?" *He mumbled in curiosity, as the light from his hands slowly closed the hole in Season's chest and neck.*

Cameron: *His armour rattled, catching Lezard's attention.* "I am not sure what it is, but it is clearly long ranged." *He spoke with a raspy voice, staring at Ridley in confusion.*

Lezard: (Long range? When I think about it, most of Ridley's attacks have been close or mid ranged.)

Tyler: *He looked behind him to Lezard and Cameron, keeping his handguns aimed at Ridley.* "How would you know that?"

Cameron: "It is something a warrior picks up on, we are not safe here."

Holland: *He coughed and dragged his feet towards Lezard, looking down to Season.* "How is he?"

Lezard: "Believe it or not, Ridley unintentionally bypassed the major arteries and blood vessels. I won't deny he's in critical condition, but I can heal the damages once I fully close the wounds."

Tyler: *He smiled at Lezard in gratitude and stared in front to Ridley, readying his fingers on the triggers.* (Good, I was really worried-)

Ridley: "Spread your justice!" *His words caused the orbs to float towards certain party members.* "Tyler, for annoying me-"

Tyler: "H-Huh?"

Ridley: "Holland, for surviving my attack. Lezard, for healing, and Cameron, I certainly haven't forgotten your betrayal-"

PKMY: *She watched the orbs float towards the party members he announced.* "Holly, get Fryfry!-"

*The orbs rippled and shot rays of lasers at the party members, causing them to violently twitch in pain.*

Tyler: "Help-arhh!"
Cameron: "Inconceivable!-"
Holland: "Fry-"
Lezard: "Wowza!" *Their skin sizzled and instantly burnt due to the lasers.*

Lance: "No!" *He shouted, watching Tyler, Holland, Cameron and Lezard collapse to the ground.*

PKMY: (Everyone!)

Ridley: *He smirked and watched the orbs of light spiral around the party members, releasing continuous laser beams.* "What a beautiful Grand-"

Lance: "Stop it!-"

Ridley: "Haha, I haven't forgotten you, Lance."

Lance: "H-Huh?"

Ridley: *He faced Lance and pointed both arms towards him, causing a cluster of white orbs to spiral towards him.* "I can finally say goodbye-"

Lance: *His face lit up and the area around him shined white, as he watched the orbs float into striking distance.* "Shit-" *He grunted under his breath and raised his arm, bracing himself for pain.*

----------

Sofia: *Her ponytail rapidly flapped behind her.* (There is no way those three can keep up with me-) *Darkness grew from her ears and covered her eyes, acting as a black visor for goggles.*

Celest: *Glittering aura moved like liquid around her eyes and hardened into a white pair of goggles.* (Sofia-) *She flew through a strong air rip, causing her to sway to one side.* (She's got the upper hand!)

Alicia: *Golden goggles materialised across her face and over her eyes.* (Thank you again, Celest for the goggles-) *She adjusted the goggles and looked up, watched Sofia blast through the clouds.*

Sofia: *She glided above the clouds and giggled, firmly holding onto the whip.* (I'll use the clouds as a distraction and attack with brute force-)

Alicia: *She blasted through a swirl of clouds in front of Sofia.* "ICICLE-"

Sofia: *She gasped in fright, looking at Alicia with widening eyes.* (How did she keep up-?!) *She instinctively and quickly swayed her arm, flicking the whip in front.*

Alicia: "EDG-" *The whip slashed her across the face, causing her to spiral in the air.*

Sofia: (Fast..) *She watched Alicia slowly descend, causing her to grin in satisfaction.* (But completely inexperienced.)

Celest: (Aliciana!) *She shouted in thought, focusing her attention on Alicia.*

Alicia: *She whimpered in confusion, trying to move her body.* (My wings, why can't I-?!)

Celest: (No!) *She leant forward and straightened her body, causing her to fly faster.*

Lorilei: *She flapped her wings, struggling to maintain a fast speed.* (I haven't used my wings in some time! Right after I released my Radiatons, I was captured-)

Sofia: "Haheahe." *She looked away and soared through the clouds, licking her lips in an evil-like manner.*

Lorilei: *She watched Celest fly at incredible speeds, attempting to catch Alicia.* (I'm very slow compared to everyone!)

Celest: "Got you!" *She grabbed Alicia's hands and stopped in mid-air, discreetly sighing in relief.*

Alicia: *Blood ran down her nose.* "W-What?" *She mumbled and looked up to Celest, as if she didn't know what happened.*

Celest: "It's called Tangled Wings-"

Alicia: *She took a deep breath and gently leant back, floating in the air next to Celest.* "What is that?"

Lorilei: *She flew next to Celest and flapped her wings, taking a deep breath.* "Oh my, what happened?"

Celest: "Tangled Wings."

Lorilei: "Oh, I remember my first time-"

Alicia: "S-Sorry, but-" *She spun around and looked at Sofia, watching her hover over distant clouds.* "Why is she staring at us?"

Celest: "She's taunting us." *She hissed to herself, frowning in an annoyed manner.*

Lorilei: "She might also be planning something."

Alicia: *She wiped the blood from her nose, triggering flashbacks of Lance and PKMY's impatient attitude.* "C-Could we talk and attempt to pursue Sofia?"

Celest: "Hmm." *She smirked in agreement and her radiant wings moved like razor blades, causing her to blast towards Sofia.*

Sofia: (About time! I was getting so bored!) *She puckered her lips with boredom, as she waited for Celest to fly into striking distance.*

Alicia: *She glanced at Lorilei and focused her attention back to Sofia, readying herself.* "Come on!" *She leant forward and flew at amazing speeds through the air.*

Lorilei: *She flapped her wings with effort and caught up with Alicia.* (I'm getting used to my wings again-)

Alicia: *White puffy mist blew past her, as she soared through the clouds.* "What is Tangled Wings?"

Lorilei: "It's a term usually used in The Swarming Light Flight-. Oh?" *She paused, looking to her side at Alicia.* "Do you know what that is?"

Alicia: "Yep."

Lorilei: *She nodded her head, continuing what she was going to say.* "When new players are struck or hit in mid-air, their bodies seize up. This usually goes away when you gather more experience."

Alicia: "O-Oh." *She sounded interested, keeping her focus ahead.*

Celest: "Give up, Sofia, it's three against one!"

Sofia: "About time you caught up!"

Celest: *She pointed the white sword at Sofia, flying into striking distance.* "What!?"

Sofia: "Hahe-"

*A dark-red whip suddenly slithered through the clouds, violently stabbing Celest in the leg and arm.*

Celest: "Argh!" *She screamed in pain.*

Sofia: "Sticky Smash." *She smirked and raised her hand, revealing the whip in her hand.* "Hahe." *She looked down, watching the whip dangle in the clouds below her.*

Celest: *She gritted her teeth, frowning at Sofia.* (She used the clouds to conceal her strike!)

Sofia: "You were once known to be a very frightening warrior, Celest." *She pulled the handle up, causing the whip to violently rip out of Celest's body.*

Celest: "Tsst!" *She held her breath, trying to overcome the pain.*

Alicia: "Lorilei, b-back me up!"

Lorilei: "Oh my, of course!"

Alicia: *She flew past Celest, causing a trail of cloud to follow her.* "Harh."

Sofia: "Oh?" *She smiled in Alicia's face, who flew into striking distance.* "You're not very intimidating-"

Alicia: "Cerenity Stroke." *She waved her arm and a stroke of white light sliced Sofia across the arm.*

Sofia: "Ah!?"

Alicia: "FREEZING HOLLOWS" *She took a deep breath and leant forward, suddenly exhaling a blizzard-like vortex of mist.*

Sofia: "Hahe-" *She quickly spun around and blasted across the clouds, away from Alicia.*

Alicia: *She hovered in the air and lowered her arms, watching the mist glitter into nothing.* (She flew out of my Rostical-)

Celest: "Aliciana, heal me along the way-" *She grunted in pain and tilted her body's angle, readying herself to fly after Sofia.*

Alicia: "O-Okay!"

Celest: (How careless of me-) *She blasted across the clouds towards Sofia.*

Alicia: *She pushed herself forward and flew by Celest's side, quickly looking behind her in a curious manner.* (Where did Lorilei go?)

Celest: "Aliciana."

Alicia: "Sorry, HEALING RINGS" *Rings of light spiralled around Celest's arm and leg.*

Sofia: (That pawn-) *She watched blood run up her arm due to the force of her flight.* (Her light-based Azure Burst was sharp-)

Lorilei: "LIGHTNING BLAST"

Sofia: *She gasped and looked down in shock, watching lights flash in the clouds like a storm.* "Hah-?"

*A thick stream of lightning shot through the clouds and blasted towards Sofia's face, lighting up the nearby clouds.*

Sofia: "A-Ah-" *She came to a sudden and complete stop and pushed herself back, barely avoiding the stream of lightning.*

Lorilei: "Amazing manoeuvrability!" *She shot up through the clouds, causing a swirl of white mist to spiral around her.*

Sofia: "Haheha, fun!" *She spun around, raising her leg to the side of her head.* "Roaring Beast Kick."

Lorilei: *She flew in front of Sofia and hovered in the air, straightening her arm.* "LIGHTNING BLAST" *A blast of lightning channelled itself towards Sofia.*

Sofia: "Herh!" *She kicked the air in front and an invisible wave knocked the stream of lightning to one side.*

Lorilei: (She blocked my Remenistal!-)

Sofia: "This is fun-" *She spiralled up and giggled, looking down at Lorilei.*

Lorilei: *She hovered backwards, keeping her distance from Sofia.* (I've seen Sofia's aerial abilities, I will not underestimate her.)

Sofia: "But playing chasing wasn't as fun as I thought, so let's see some acrobatic flying skills!" *She shouted at Lorilei knowing Celest and Alicia could hear, as they flew into striking distance.*

Celest: *She stared at Sofia's back and focused, watching a glass-like sphere materialise in front of her.* "MYSTIC SHIELD STRIKE" *She pushed forward, blasting it towards Sofia.*

Sofia: "Oh really? MOONLIGHT REFLECTION" *She spun around and an oval, reflective-like ripple pulsed in front of her.*

Celest: "Moonlight Reflection?!"

Lorilei: "Oh my!" *She gasped in shock, catching Alicia's attention.*

Alicia: "What's special about that Rostical?"

Lorilei: *She watched the sphere hit the shield, causing it to ripple back.* "Mystic Shield's predecessor-"

Sofia: "Harh!" *She pushed forward, blasting the glass-like sphere back at Celest.*

Celest: "How-?" *She spun around and hit the sphere with the side of her sword, watching it shatter past her.*

Alicia: "W-What happened?"

Sofia: "Hahehahe." *She hovered in the air and lowered her arm, causing the oval shape shield to fade away.*

Celest: "Unlike all reflective skills, Moonlight Reflection is the only Remenistal that is able to fully deflect an attack."

Alicia: "W-Wow." *She whispered under her breath, staring at Sofia in shock.*

Sofia: "I'm a boss outta your league!"

Celest: "Tsskt." *She frowned, raising an arm into the air.*

Lorilei: (An opening!) *She shouted in thought and straightened her arm, aiming it at Sofia.*

Celest: "HOLY LANCE"

Lorilei: "LIGHTNING BLAST"

Alicia: "ICICLE EDGE"

Sofia: "Hahe hahe, Rostical from three different angles-?" *She giggled and flicked the whip above her, causing it to grab hold of the air.*

Celest: "Humph." *She swayed her arm down, watching a white lance screech through the air towards Sofia.*

Sofia: "Yee harh!" *She pulled herself up, as the white lance screeched past her.* "Wow, that sounded frightening!-"

Celest: (So close!-)

Alicia: *She waved downwards, causing four ice spears to blast towards Sofia.* (I just need one to defeat her-)

Sofia: *She looked up to the ice spears and waited for them to plummet into striking distance.* (Waiting.)

Celest: (They're going to hit!-)

Sofia: (Now!-) *She hunched forward and twirled around in a defensive manner, causing her radiant wings to shatter the four ice spears.*

Alicia: *She gasped in shock, watching the ice fall towards the clouds.* (She shattered them!-)

Sofia: (Wings are full of Radiatons, I've always wondered why it was never used in combat to this extent.) *She leant back, shattering the excess ice off her wings.*

Lorilei: *She flapped her wings and faced Sofia, who stood in the air above her.* (We need to start combining our skills, to create a powerful combination Sofia can't resist-) *She pushed forward, blasting a stream of lightning towards Sofia.*

Sofia: *She licked her lips in excitement and spun upside down, pushing herself off the air towards the lightning.* "Haheahe."

Lorilei: (She's diving directly towards my lightning! Has she gone mad?!)

Sofia: "Hiyah!" *She purposely spiralled in circles down the lightning towards Lorilei.*

Lorilei: (Impossible!)

Alicia: "Frosted skies reveal the truth, please with the power strike forward-" *She placed her hand in front of her mouth and pretended to hold a straw, puckering her lips.* "FREEZING HOLLOWS"

*Alicia took a deep breath and puffed out glitters of ice, suddenly exhaling a blizzard-like vortex of mist.*

Celest: *She looked at her hand, forming a fist.* (No damage? The speed of Aliciana's healing is on par with some experienced members of The Wise!)

Lorilei: "FLAME BOLT" *She cupped her hands and pushed them forward, shooting balls of fire at Sofia.*

Sofia: "MOONLIGHT REFLECTION" *She quickly flew away from the fading stream of lightning and blocked the fireballs, bouncing them back towards Lorilei.*

Lorilei: *She gasped with widening eyes and quickly flapped her wings, flying to the side.* "Oh my."

Celest: *She looked at Sofia in determination and leant forward, suddenly blasting towards her.* "Harh!"

Sofia: "Hehahe." *She discreetly glanced at Celest in the corner of her eye and spun around, raising her arm.* "Harh!" *She flicked her wrist and the whip sliced the air in front of Celest.*

Celest: *She quickly stopped out of the whip's range, listening to it whoosh past her.* (I can't read the flow of that whip!-)

Sofia: *She stared at Celest and smirked, swirling the whip above her.* "Can't read it, can you?! Haheahe-"

*A pulse of mist instantly froze the whip, causing Sofia to pause in mid-sentence.*

Sofia: *She looked up and watched boulder-size chunks of ice explode on the whip, causing her to descend.* "H-Huh?"

Celest: (An opportunity!) *She flew towards Sofia, firmly holding onto the white sword.*

Lorilei: (Perfect-) *She pushed upwards, blasting a stream of lightning towards Sofia.* "LIGHTNING BLAST"

Celest: *She flew face to face to Sofia and raised her arm.* "Goodbye-"

Sofia: "H-Huh?" *She looked up and watched Celest fly into striking distance, startled.*

Celest: "That will hurt you."

Sofia: "That-?"

Celest: *She lowered the sword and quickly flew to the side, watching a stream of lightning shoot through Sofia's side.*

Sofia: "Argh!" *She screamed with squinted eyes.*

Celest: "Harh!" *She grabbed the sword with both hands and sliced it downwards, causing Sofia to cough in astonishment.*

Sofia: "You cut me?!" *She shouted in shock, watching blood drip off her forehead.*

Alicia: "'O holy powers draw towards me, HOLY LANCE" *She raised her arm, running it through her hair.* "Celest, watch out!"

Celest: *She looked over her shoulder to Alicia and nodded her head, slowly drifting away from Sofia.* "..."

Alicia: "T-Take this!" *She dropped her arm, causing a lance made of light to plummet towards Sofia.*

Sofia: (Damn this!-) *She pushed herself towards Celest, causing her to avoid the lance.*

Alicia: *She gasped in frustration, watching the lance of light shoot through the clouds below.* (How did it miss-!?)

Sofia: "Hah!" *She kicked across Celest's face at amazing speeds.*

Celest: *She quickly blocked Sofia's kick with her sword, frowning in confusion.* "The additional weight on your whip, how are you not falling-?"

Sofia: "Hah!" *She punched towards Celest's face.*

Celest: "Cerenity Stroke." *She waved the sword downwards, causing a slash-like line of light to block Sofia's punch.*

Sofia: "Hiyah!" *She quickly slapped away the fading light and jumped forward, kicking Celest across the cheek.*

Celest: "Oof-" *She spiralled to one side and bent her knees, as if she landed on the ground.*

Alicia: "Celest!-"

Celest: (Blast the Astragons!) "Harh!" *She jumped towards Sofia with her sword raised.*

Sofia: "Now it's time to raise the difficulty." *She spoke in a serious manner, catching Celest's attention.*

Celest: "You've been wounded-"

Sofia: "Which will heal due to my accelerated healing!" *She spoke in pain, covering the burns on her side.*

Celest: "Thy do not need to hear any more words!"

Sofia: "..." *She suddenly leant forward and flipped across the air towards Celest.*

Alicia: (It's like she's flipping on the ground-)

Celest: "Useless-" *She quickly slashed across Sofia's face, watching her flip over her swing.*

Sofia: *She flipped onto her feet and quickly flicked her arms, slapping the whip across Celest's face.* "Harh!"

Celest: "Oof-" *Ice shattered off the whip across her face.* "Urgh!-"

Alicia: "Celest!" *Her wings moved like razor blades, allowing her to blast towards Sofia.* "Icicle Stroke."

Celest: (It felt like it drained my-) *She sighed and lost strength to her limbs, causing her to fall.*

Sofia: "Hahehahe-" *She licked her lips while watching her burns from Lorilei's lightning close up.*

Alicia: "Harh!" *She waved her arm and a stroke of blue ice sliced Sofia across the face.*

Sofia: "Tssk-" *She slapped her cheek, shattering the ice off her face.*

Alicia: "Blast it-"

Sofia: "My turn!-" *She spun around, swinging the whip with her.*

Lorilei: "Move back, Alicia! The whip extends!" *She had images of the whip extending and attacking Cassidy on its own accord.*

Sofia: "Yee harh!" *The whip slithered like a serpent and flicked towards Alicia's head.*

Alicia: "FREEZING HOLLOWS" *She quickly puffed out a pulse of mist and a wall of ice exploded in front of her.*

Sofia: "Nah uh-" *She flicked her wrist and the whip violently shattered the wall of ice with ease.*

Alicia: *She quickly flew backwards away from Sofia, causing her pendant and hair to flap in front.* "Th-Thank you for the warning-"

Lorilei: *She nodded her head in appreciation and reached back, suddenly pushing towards Sofia.* "LIGHTNING BLAST"

Celest: *She looked up and watched a stream of lightning spark towards the evasive Sofia.* (Mortal be damned, thy'm out already?) *She dropped the white sword, causing it to disintegrate into swirls of light.*

?????: "Given up? Thou've taught me to never give up."

Celest: "H-Huh?" *A ray of pink light instantly healed and revitalised her.*

?????: *A man appeared in a cluster of light above Celest and caught her arm, causing her to stop falling.* "Now that thou're better, let us defeat Sofia."

Celest: "Locki!" *She smiled in hope, nodding her head in agreement.*

Locki: (Sofia? She is alive?!) *He looked up and observed Sofia, watching her giggle at Lorilei and Alicia.* (She hasn't noticed my presence yet-)

Celest: "Locki?" *She flew up, hovering by Locki's side.*

Locki: *He took the opportunity to watch Sofia's fighting style, frowning in a worried manner.* (Her power rivals our own! How is this possible?!)

Sofia: *She smirked, as she flew to one side avoiding several balls of fire.* "..." *She flew to the other side avoiding spears of ice.* "I'm starting to grow tired, even of this-"

----------

Lance: *The orbs fired laser beams, causing him to grunt in pain.* (Shit, they burn!)

PKMY: *She flashstepped next to Lance and grabbed his arms, squinting her eyes at the beams.* (Flashstep, idiot!-)

Lance: *PKMY's voice echoed in his head.* (Don't you think I'd try-?!)

PKMY: "Tssk." *She grunted in frustration, quickly flashstepping with Lance out of the area.*

Ridley: *He sighed and smirked, lowering his arms.* (The damage is done..)

*Lance and PKMY appeared in front of Season, Lezard, Tyler, Holland and Cameron, as the area reverted back to normal.*

Ridley: "Wasn't that a splendid skill?"

Lance: "Ah, my legs are numb-" *His legs went limp, causing him to collapse onto the ground next to PKMY.*

PKMY: "Wat are you doing?!" *She looked down to her feet, frowning in frustration.*

Ridley: "Oh? Don't be so hard on him, those Radiaton filled beams numbed the receptors."

PKMY: "Receptors?"

Ridley: "From an energy perspective, it impacts the way the Neurons and Astragons interact with each other, from a biological perspective, it impacts the neuron's cell bodies in which how they transmit information."

PKMY: "Tssk-" *She stood in a battle-ready pose, triggering flashbacks of her fight with Pepper.* (It was similar to what Pepper used on The Aspestosis Ship.)

Lance: *He lay on his side and twitched his arms, trying to move.* (Dammit!)

Ridley: "So out of everyone here, this is as far as you all got?"

PKMY: *She looked behind her to the party with a saddened face.* (Everyone, get up!)

Ridley: "Hmm? What exactly are you doing?" *A black sword puffed in his hand and he casually walked towards PKMY with evil intent.*

Lance: "P-PKMY, do it, do it."

PKMY: (He just called me PKMY-) "D-Do wat-?"

Lance: "Get him." *He moaned in frustration as if he was angry at himself.*

PKMY: *A heartbeat pulsed through her body.* (Their will, I can feel it-)

Ridley: "Have you given up? That strange look on your face? It's hilarious to watch."

PKMY: (I can hear your voices, the voices of your drive-)

Holland: (Must protect, Freya, Amy, everyone-)
Season: (I must not let our mother's death be in vain!)

Tyler: (I want the fighting to end!)
Cameron: (Betrayal, you have caused too much stress-)

Lezard: (Father and mother monster! I cannot forgive you! I will seek revenge!)
Lance: (That heap of shit, I have to beat you, I have to! Ash!)

PKMY: *She closed her eyes and inhaled deeply.* "I can feel their drive!"

Ridley: "Their drive? Oh goody?" *He chuckled, as he continued to walk closer to PKMY.* "You're the only one left, if it was this easy, I should've done it from the start-"

PKMY: *She opened her eyes and raised her hands, forming fists.* (This energy.)

Ridley: *He stopped and thought to himself.* "Oh, that's right, I don't feel right hurting the innocent."

PKMY: (This energy!-) *She glanced at her fists and looked at Ridley, staring at him in determination.*

Ridley: "Hey, I'm a nice person. Please go home."

PKMY: "W-What?" *She looked at him startled.*

Ridley: "Go home, so you don't have to die-"

PKMY: "Tssk-" *She stepped forward with a disappearing image and reappeared in front of Ridley.* "Mountain's might and power, ninety three flash strike, Emperor's Fury."

Ridley: "Oh? So this is your decision after me offering you-"

PKMY: "Harh!" *She punched the air in front of Ridley, causing her hair to blow back.*

Ridley: *He sighed and raised his hand to block her fist.* "Why don't you learn-?"

PKMY: *A sudden and extreme force, pushed Ridley back.* "Yarh!"

Ridley: "Oh my?!" *He looked shocked and watched his feet slide back in amazement.* "You're very strong-"

PKMY: "Grarh!" *Her hands lost their image and a wave of fists punched Ridley on his sides and shoulders, causing him to look alert.*

Ridley: (This is naturally a very powerful Azure Burst, but.. This force, it shouldn't be this strong-)

PKMY: (This isn't exhausting my Neurons?! But this sudden power-) *She quickly grunted in pain, as her muscles visibly wobbled in her arms.* (-This power is causing immense stress on my body-)

Ridley: *He focused his attention on the fists, causing him to lean back and forth at amazing speeds.* (A way to avoid a powerful attack is to match its speed-)

PKMY: (He's avoiding-) *She grunted in thought.* (I have to go faster-)

Ridley: "You caught me off guard for a moment, but now I'm fine." *He spoke in a relaxed manner, continuing to avoid PKMY's aura-like fists at amazing speeds.*

PKMY: *She jumped forward with blurred waves for arms, ignoring her flapping hair.* "Tssk-"

Ridley: "MANIPULATE, SERENE STATE" *A gust of light erupted from the ground and spiralled into the air above PKMY.*

PKMY: *She stood straight and raised her arm towards the light, causing its image to appear.* (What is my arm doing-?) "Myrror Shield." *Fireflies materialised into the air above her.*

Ridley: "Take consequences for your decision!" *He waved downwards and the lights suddenly crashed on top of PKMY, exploding the ground around her.*

PKMY: *The light faded and the shield shattered before disintegrating away.* (What!? How?!)

Ridley: "Hmm?" *He watched the dirt fade and revealed PKMY standing as if nothing happened.* "You're standing as if my attack had no-"

PKMY: *Her image disappeared and reappeared in the air above Ridley.* "SOLAR FLARE" *She punched downwards and a beam of white light with fluoro blue shading, blasted towards Ridley.*

Ridley: (When did she learn this technique?!) *He jumped forward avoiding the beam, which hit the ground behind him.*

PKMY: (Missed!-) *She watched Ridley run away from her.*

Ridley: *He looked up to PKMY with a smirk and flashstepped.* "NIGHTSHADE-" *He flashstepped on the ground directly underneath PKMY.*

PKMY: *She noticed Ridley, causing her to snap her fingers, disintegrating the beam.* "Hmph-" *She slowly fell towards the ground, frowning at Ridley.*

Ridley: "Hah." *He straightened his arm above his head and a stream of black lightning blasted towards PKMY.*

PKMY: (Striking me in mid-air-) *She grunted, forming a fist with a frown.* "LIGHTNING BLAST" *She punched in front, watching yellow lightning blast towards Ridley.*

*Ridley and PKMY's lightning connected, causing black and yellow strings of lightning to spark in the air.*

PKMY: (I need to land on the ground-) *She pushed forward and her lightning intensified, causing her to slowly descend.*

Ridley: *He lowered his arm with PKMY, watching her land on the ground to safety.* "I'm intrigued-" *He watched black lightning spark around his hand, as PKMY's lightning disintegrated into nothing.*

PKMY: *She quickly leant to the side, watching Ridley's black lightning blast in the air past her.* "..."

Ridley: "When did you come to the possession of all these new Remenistal? And since when have you altered your elemental affinity-?"

PKMY: "Fierceful storms, rain from the divine spirit of purity-"

Ridley: "It's rude not to answer back!"

PKMY: *She flashstepped behind Ridley.* "Power of the beast roaring through the waves, lend me your strength, AQUATIC DIVIDER"

Ridley: (Season's trademark Remenistal!-) *He gasped in shock, watching two waves of water explode on either side with widening eyes.*

*The two waves suddenly slammed into each other, crushing Ridley's body.*

PKMY: (Something broke, I heard it-) *She stepped back and turned around, flashstepping in front of the party.*

*The party members lay in awkward positions unconscious on the ground, causing PKMY to raise her arms.*

PKMY: "Sacred light of Radiatons cluster and form, aid and replenish what has been lost, SOOTHING LIGHT" *A ball of light gathered in the air above the party.*

Ridley: *The water violently crashed around him before draining into the ground.* "Ah-" *He dropped to his knees, causing his black sword to puff away.* (My body has already begun to heal itself-)

PKMY: *She looked up and dropped her arms, causing beams of light to fall and explode on each party member.* (This power? I understand it, but I don't know how-)

Ridley: *He stood up with a smirk and cracked his bones.* "Ah, back into place-" *He held his shoulder in pain before walking towards PKMY.*

PKMY: *She faced Ridley and frowned.* (This is bad, I can't feel my legs.) *Her fingers uncontrollably twitched.* (My body can't handle whatever this power is!)

Ridley: "Now, I'll let the light shine against my darkness, and have the darkness aid the light-" *One of his eyes shined gold, while the other became black.*

PKMY: "Stop talking-?!"

Ridley: "This is the end-" *He instantly flashstepped, causing a sonic-like screech to echo the air.*

PKMY: *She watched the ground explode where Ridley stood, stepping back in reaction.* "Fast?!" *She suddenly slammed face first into the ground, causing a pulse of grass to blow around her.*

Ridley: *His image suddenly appeared where PKMY stood.* "Hmm?" *He cracked his fingers with a smile.*

PKMY: "Karh-" *She coughed in shock, lifting her face out of the grass.*

Ridley: "Hmm?" *He listened to glittering-like noises, causing him to notice the light healing the party members.* "Foolish woman-" *He waved his arms over the light, causing the beams to twinkle away.* "I don't know how you received such a power-up, but I can't tolerate this-"

PKMY: *She wheezed in pain and coughed again, spitting out dirt.* (What hit me!? My lung? One of my lungs has been punctured!-)

Ridley: *He looked annoyed and sighed.* "I gave you the opportunity-" *His image suddenly appeared over PKMY and he lifted his leg.* "This is your own doing-" *He instantly kicked PKMY on the side, blasting her across the ground.*

PKMY: *She tumbled across the ground as if she was a rag doll.* "Ergh-" *She opened her eyes and tried to slide on her feet.*

Ridley: "Now it's time for you to die, Amy Seraph."

PKMY: (I can't-) *She hit the ground a certain way, causing her to spiral in the air.* (-Get my grounding-) *She spiralled upright and straightened her legs, tapping the ground with her feet.*

Ridley: "Trying to stop yourself?" *He appeared above PKMY in slow motion and grabbed her arm.* (I'll be happy to help-)

PKMY: *She flew past Ridley and violently swayed back, due to the force of being grabbed.* "Gah!-" *She grunted in pain and watched her arm extend, causing her clothes to rip.*

Ridley: "Suddenly stopping like that would hurt, no?"

PKMY: *Her wrist cracked around Ridley's grip, causing her to grunt in pain.* "Argh-"

Ridley: "Here you go." *He threw PKMY down and watched her slam into the ground, causing a spiral of dirt to swirl around her.*

PKMY: "Karh!" *She wheezed out a sigh.*

Ridley: *He landed on the ground and a black sword puffed into his hand.* "Like your sister, I will ram this through your head." *He took several steps forward and hovered over PKMY, raising the sword at the back of her head.* "You could have chosen to prevent this."

PKMY: "N-No-" *She wheezed and leant up, awkwardly standing up.*

Ridley: *He looked at PKMY surprised.* "You stand up.. I'm really impressed." *He lowered the sword in amazement.*

PKMY: "LIGHTNING-"

Ridley: "Haha, no." *He shook his head and stepped forward, suddenly ramming the sword through PKMY's heart.*

PKMY: "Herharh-?!" *She gasped with a dropping jaw, allowing blood to ooze out from the sides of her mouth.*

Ridley: "Sofia told me, the heart is the hardest organ to heal. Fascinating, I would've guessed that the brain would be, but it is what it is"

PKMY: *She gargled and coughed out more blood.* (Heart?)

Ridley: "But you lot seem to always surprise me, so I won't take any chances-" *He ripped the sword out and raised it behind him, pointing the tip at PKMY's face.* "Die-"

*A sudden gust of wind blew past PKMY, causing sparks to scatter around Ridley's black sword.*

Ridley: *He watched the sparks scatter past PKMY's face with widening eyes.* "You've got to be kidding me?!" *He shouted in shock, intensely staring at Teresa and Jewel in disbelief.*

Jewel: *She panted in exhaustion.* "We blocked the attack successfully, Teresa."

Teresa: *She held the Pentarang over her head and flicked her hand, pushing the black sword back.* "Indeed!" *She grunted in anger, watching Ridley take a few steps back.*

PKMY: "..." *Her eyes rolled back and she became limp, falling back.*

Jewel: "Oh no-" *She quickly lowered her sword and grabbed PKMY, catching her before she collapsed onto the ground.*

Ridley: "How?"

Teresa: "Your death, I can see it!"

Ridley: "I killed you? I felt your Neurons deplete, completely."

Teresa: *She stood up straight and held the Pentarang with both hands.* "Jewel, focus your attention, we will kill him this time."

Jewel: *She gently placed PKMY on the ground and stood up, raising her sword.* "This time, we will not lose!"

Ridley: *He looked annoyed with a slight smirk.* "Alright, round two." *He pointed the black sword at Teresa and Jewel.*

----------

Sofia: *She spiralled over a funnel of gushing water and laughed at Lorilei flicking the whip across her face.* "Haheha-"

Lorilei: "H-Huh-" *A loud slapping sound echoed from her cheek, causing the funnel of water to lose its current.*

Sofia: "Hahehahe." *She watched the water splash and fall towards the clouds like rain.*

Alicia: "ICICLE-"

Sofia: "Edge?" *She blasted towards Alicia as she flicked her arm, causing the whip to instantly wrap itself around Alicia's neck.*

Alicia: "A-Ah?!" *She placed both hands on the whip, trying to loosen it.*

Sofia: *She watched Alicia attempt to pull the whip away from her neck.* "Trying to break my whip's hold? Hahe, I'll snap your neck before-"

Locki: *He blasted up and uppercut Sofia with an incredible force.* "Harh!"

Sofia: *She blasted back in surprise, letting go of the whip.* "Ah-?!" *She spiralled in the air, frowning in pain.* (No!-) *Her wings shined, causing her to instantly stop in mid-air.*

Locki: *He raised both arms and reached behind his back, pulling them forward.* "Thy will finish this!" *He held a large black sword in one hand and a red sword in the other, ignoring wing-like sparks on his sides.*

Sofia: *She smiled, showing blood in between her teeth.* "Locki."

Locki: "How?"

Sofia: "Hah?" *She licked her lips, sucking the blood around her mouth.*

Locki: "Thou were petrified."

Sofia: *She paused, glaring at Locki with her cold eyes.* "My love saved me."

Locki: "How?"

Sofia: "He took the time to save me.." *She hissed under her breath, as if she held a grudge against Locki.*

Locki: "What thou have done is a breach in Valhalla's rules!"

Sofia: "Do you think I care?! You all left me for dead! You thought it was my game over and didn't know I had a continue!" *She screamed out of character.*

Locki: "Regardless of what transpired, that isn't an excuse-"

Sofia: *She frowned with watering eyes.* "You disgust me."

Locki: "Being hurt doesn't excuse you for acting like a bad person! Surviving pain doesn't grant you privilege."

Sofia: *She giggled and shook her head as if she didn't care, blatantly ignoring Locki.* "Now it's time."

Locki: "Time for what?"

Celest: *She flew up next to Lorilei, inspecting her wounds.* "Are you okay?"

Lorilei: *She covered her face, as blood ran down her arm from her cheek.* "Y-Yes." *She spoke with a high tone of voice, trying to cover up the pain.*

Alicia: *She breathed heavily, as sweat ran down her face.* "Don't underestimate her-"

Locki: *He watched Sofia's whip fall through the clouds, causing him to smirk.* "Don't make me repeat myself! Time for what?!"

Sofia: "Time for me to raise the difficulty levels again. But, this time.. The jump in difficulty will be vast-" *She giggled and one of her eyes shined gold while the other turned to black.*

Locki: *He intensely stared at Sofia's eyes, hiding his confusion.* (Her wings and eyes-?)

Sofia: "Harh!" *She pushed forward, soaring through the air towards Locki.*

Locki: "A frontal attack? That won't work-"

Sofia: "Bloody Eruption."

Locki: *He raised the swords in a defensive manner.* (An Azure-?)

Sofia: "Yiharh!"

Locki: "One on one, thy can beat thou!" *He sliced the swords in front, slashing Sofia across the face.*

Sofia: "Hah!" *She became oblivious to Locki's slashes, as blood-like water swirled around her left fist.*

Locki: "D-Do thou not feel pain-?"

Sofia: *She stuck her tongue out in excitement and noticed Locki's shocked reaction, as she unnaturally flicked her legs up.* "Strike one!"

Locki: (She broke through my offensive so easily!-)

Sofia: *She kicked Locki's arms away and flew face to face, punching him in the gut.* "Hiyah!-"

Locki: "Owh!" *He leant forward, as blood-like water exploded on his sides.* "Water?"

Sofia: *She smirked and applied pressure on her fist.* "This will cause your ribs to-"

Celest: "Locki!"

Sofia: "Grr." *Her eye twitched in anger, causing her to blast Locki back.*

Locki: *He stared at a ring of blood-like water pulse in a large circle from his chest.* "Powerful-" *He slid across the sky, holding his shoulder.*

Sofia: *She blasted directly towards Locki and raised her right fist.* "I'm not done with you yet, strike two! Holy Eruption."

Locki: *His eyes widened in shock.* "CELESTRIAL LAN-"

Sofia: *Light-like liquid swirled around her fist and she uppercut Locki in the face, causing an explosion of white water to blast in his face.*

Locki: "Tuoff-" *Sofia's fist tilted his head up from under his chin, causing him to look up.*

Sofia: "And for the finishing strike! Strike three." *She pushed her fist and shouted, uppercutting Locki high into the air.*

Locki: *He stared at a ring of white water pulse in a large circle from under his chin.* (Argh-)

Sofia: "Haheha." *She shot up and floated above Locki.* "Ougi."

Alicia: (That scary woman, she's even faster than me!)

Lorilei: (What did Locki say to her? The way she fought us and the way she's fighting him now, it's like day and night.) *She panted in exhaustion, glancing at Celest.* "Go, help Locki, he's getting thrown around!"

Celest: "Yes-"

Sofia: "Darkness of wicked blood, light of pure heart, combine your forces and show 'em what I can do!-" *A swirl of blood-like liquid swirled in her left hand, as a light-like liquid spiralled in her right hand.* "Holy Red Eruption."

Locki: *His arms slightly twitched in alert.* (Thy can't respond in time!-)

Sofia: "Harh!" *She punched both fists into Locki's chest and pushed forward, causing him to instantly plummet towards the mountain.*

Celest: "W-?!" *She watched an eruption of dirt and rock explode on the mountain.*

Alicia: *She looked at the mountain, watching an expanding dirt cloud form around Locki.* (He hit the mountain almost instantaneously!)

Sofia: *She giggled, as swirls of red and white liquid swooshed in the direction of the dirt cloud.* "Hahehahe-" *She spread her arms and blasted towards the mountain, shaking the water from her fists.*

Locki: *He coughed out dirt and pushed a large log off his chest.* (Four ribs have broken-) *He wheezed and leant up.* "Where are my-?" *He looked around for his swords.*

Sofia: *She landed heavily on the ground, catching Locki's attention.* "Now, where are ya?" *She giggled angrily, inspecting the dirt cloud in a blind-like manner.*

Locki: (Thy won't be able to self-regenerate my body in time for me to merely flee from her-)

?????: "I say, what are you doing, Sofia?"

Sofia: "Hah?" *She stopped and stared through a cluster of dirt, squinting her eyes in a curious manner.* "Who's there?"

Locki: *A woman walked past Locki, causing him to smile in shock and disbelief.* "Thou're an adult?"

?????: "..."

Locki: *He smiled with watering eyes.* "Thy tried so hard to object to your banishment!"

?????: "Locki, I've missed you-"

Sofia: "Who's there?!" *She raised her arm and waved her hand across, causing the dirt to instantly blow away.*

*Sofia stepped back in shock, intensely staring at the woman with long blonde hair.*

Sofia: "Y-You!"

Locki: "Pepper."

Pepper: *She walked in front of Locki and stood in a proud manner, staring at Sofia with an emotionless face.* "I say, you dare defy the order created by The Wise?!"

Sofia: "H-How? M-My love, k-killed you!"

Pepper: "I say, enough questions." *She reached over her shoulder and pulled her arm forward, causing the area to momentarily light up.*

Sofia: *She watched sparks scatter around Pepper's mallet.* "How, are you alive?"

Locki: *He coughed up blood and held his chest, staring at Pepper's back with a smile.* "H-How?"

Pepper: "The spirit is indestructible, as a Sacred Knight, I was given another chance."

Sofia: *She gritted her teeth and raised her arm.* (I know he killed her, he was positive!)

Pepper: *She lowered her arm and dropped the mallet to her side, causing the ground to rumble.* "Although, I will not give you any chances!" *She flicked her wrist, causing the mallet to swing in the air next to her face.*

Sofia: "Grr." *She waved her hand across, causing a long stream of sparks to scatter around her whip.*

Locki: (Her whip? Thy saw it fall to-) *He groaned in pain, losing his track of thought.*

Pepper: "Enough talk! Shattering Stones." *She jumped forward across the ground, giving the illusion she glided above it.*

Sofia: "Grah-" *She grunted and stepped back in shock, as if she was afraid of Pepper's presence.*

Pepper: *Her body glowed a shade of blue and she raised the mallet, leaping into striking distance.* "I say, take this-"

Sofia: "Whip Smack, Crescent Snap."

Pepper: *Her mallet glowed red and she slammed it forward.* "Herh-"

Sofia: *She bent back and watched the mallet scrape across her chest.* (Close!-)

Pepper: *She spun around keeping the spinning momentum and skipped towards Sofia.* "Harh!" *She swayed forward, slamming the mallet directly towards Sofia.*

Sofia: "Herh-" *She leant to the side in an evasive manner and watched the ground smash around Pepper's mallet, causing her to tumble back.*

Pepper: *She quickly looked up, ignoring the blonde swirls of hair in her face.* (Did I hit her? I felt it skim her-)

Sofia: "Hah!" *She spun around and suddenly slashed Pepper across the face with her extending whip, flicking it behind her.*

Locki: (Pepper?!) *Objects blurred around his eyes.* (Am I unconscious? In a dream? Or am I.. In The Astral Plains?)

Sofia: (I know I'm stronger than her, so why does something feel off with her?) *She crouched down and tightened her grip on the whip, readying herself.*

Pepper: *She stood up straight and tilted her head, flicking her hair over her shoulders.* "I say, is that all you got-?"

Sofia: "Herh-" *She leapt into the air over Pepper at incredible speeds, purposely letting the whip flick her across the face as she passed.*

Pepper: *She looked up in pain and frowned at Sofia, raising the mallet next to her face.* "..."

Sofia: *She landed on the ground and ran around Pepper, frowning with determination.* (She didn't move from her spot, didn't my awesome hit work?)

Pepper: "SERENITY SWIRL" *She swayed her hand at Sofia without looking and a vortex of light spiralled directly towards her.*

Sofia: *Her face lit up, as she watched the light become blinding.* "Grr-" *She looked up to a thick tree above her, bending her knees.* "Hah!" *She jumped high into the air and flicked the whip, causing a large branch to snap off like butter.*

Pepper: *She watched the light explode in the distance.* "Missed the target-" *She looked up and watched Sofia run along the falling branch.*

Sofia: *She stood on top of the falling branch and looked down with a smirk, as her ponytail flapped upwards.* (This branch will crush her-)

Pepper: *She flashstepped on the branch next to Sofia.* "Sacred blood throughout thy veins, I say heed thout command-"

Sofia: "..." *Her eyes widened and her jaw dropped, as she stared at Pepper in shock.*

Pepper: "SOUTHERN CROSS"

*Golden lines drew themselves on the branch around Pepper and travelled underneath Sofia's feet.*

Sofia: (No, I have to get out of the glyph's range!-) *A bright light shined from the glyph, as it made unusual sounds.*

Pepper: "Humph." *The glyph became blinding and the sounds of Sofia screaming could be heard.*

Sofia: *She fell off the falling branch, as steam sizzled off one side of her body.* (This hurts-)

Pepper: *She flashstepped in mid-air next to Sofia.* "Nine finger snap-majestic pulse." *An arc of light glittered around her finger and she pointed it at Sofia.*

Sofia: *She stared at Pepper's finger in shock.* "Don't-"

Pepper: *She flicked her finger and the light disappeared.* "You clearly had multiple chances to surrender-" *A small arc of light slammed into Sofia's chest and exploded.*

Sofia: "Gah-" *Her arms and legs swayed, as she lost control of her limbs.*

Pepper: *She spun around and radiant wings blasted from her back, causing her to float in the air.* "Pitiful-" *She watched Sofia hit the ground, causing a loud thump to be heard.*

Sofia: *She looked up with blurred vision and stared at the lights generated by Pepper's wings.* "You-. No!-"

*The branch fell on top of Sofia, causing the ground to rumble and dirt to puff into the air.*

Locki: "P-Pep-Pepper?"

Pepper: *She floated down to the ground and looked at Locki, slowly approaching him.* "Locki."

Locki: "How? Did you survive?"

Pepper: "No." *She flicked her long blonde hair over her shoulder and kneeled down to Locki.* "There is something I need to tell you."

*Celest, Lorilei and Alicia flew towards the mountain.*

Celest: "We need to help Locki-"

Darkwing: "Skree."

Lorilei: "Oh my? Did you hear that?" *She flapped her wings, slightly slowing down.*

Alicia: "No, those creatures." *She looked around frightened, catching Celest's attention.*

Celest: "What creatures-?"

*A black cloud of shadow flew off the side of the mountain and flocked directly towards Celest, Lorilei and Alicia.*

Lorilei: "What are they?"

Celest: "A cloud?"

Alicia: "They are skeletal creatures we believe are the Consultant's doing."

Celest: *She stared at the flock of Darkwings with widening eyes.* "There's too many to count!"

Darkwing: "Skree!" *It flapped its wings, as it flew through the air.*

Celest: "Why couldn't thy sense these before?" *She stopped, hovering in the air.*

Alicia: *She spiralled back and silently stared at Lorilei and Celest, noticing their anxious faces.* (I really dislike those creatures!)

Locki: "W-What do you need to tell me?"

Pepper: "How I was given life."

Locki: "Given? So, you were dead?"

Pepper: "Yes-cghk" *She gagged, causing Locki to look at her in shock.*

Locki: "What?" *He looked down and noticed black veins growing out of Pepper's chest, stomach and neck.*

Sofia: *She grunted in rage as she covered one eye in pain.* "Game over!" *She screamed as blood poured down her arm.*

Locki: "What are-?" *He closely inspected the veins with double vision.* (Whips?)

Sofia: *She sniffed and wiped her face, smearing dirt across her cheek.* "Haheahe!"

Locki: *He heard screeches in the distance, causing him to look into the air in confusion.* "What is that?"

Sofia: "The army of Darkwings! I summoned them to kill your other party members, hahehaheaheahea."

Pepper: *Blood ran from her wounds and dripped on to the ground.* "What is this?"

Sofia: "My Ougi! Multi-Vein Snap."

Pepper: *She gasped and dropped to her knees in front of Locki.* "It's draining-"

Locki: *He watched Sofia's black vein-like whips move through Pepper.* "G-Get them out!"

Sofia: *Her visible wounds started to heal and close up, causing her to sigh in pleasure.* "Your Radiatons, are filled with hope, love and warmth. It tastes so nice-" *She raised her hand and licked the blood off her fingers.*

Locki: *He helplessly stared at Pepper with desperation.* (This infuriates me, I can't do anything-)

Pepper: "With your attack, you have determined your own fate!"

Sofia: "Hah? I've determined my own fate?" *She stood up straight and lowered her arms, picking shards of bark out of her healing waist.* "How? I'm all healed now and I've punctured several of your major organs."

Pepper: *The 'S'-shaped tattoo appeared on her forehead.* "Your being will be purified."

Locki: (Something feels odd with Pepper-) *He looked at her in confusion.* (She's been struck with life-threatening wounds, yet, she talks as if she's going to win-)

Pepper: "This will take a moment, but once you realise what is going to happen. You will tremble and cry in fear-" *She looked over her shoulder, staring at Sofia with cold eyes.*

Sofia: *She grunted, as she hid her intimidation.* (How dare she intimidate me!) *She frowned and pulled the handle back, violently ripping the whips out of Pepper's back.*

----------

Ridley: *He watched Jewel take several steps towards him.* (Despite these two ladies being number one in ranking. My power has-) *A heartbeat pulsed through his body, causing him to gag and stumble forward.* (What?)

Teresa: *She glanced over her shoulder and looked at PKMY, watching her lay on the ground in a worried manner.* (Even knowing Ridley's power, he has still managed to incapacitate the entire party?)

Ridley: *He coughed and stood up straight, hiding his sudden loss of composure.* (That was a sickly feeling-) *He looked up into the sky and noticed the red moon.*

Jewel: "I will not fail this time!" *She panted with her mouth open.*

Ridley: (Blast, The Rubistral Moon is already taking its toll on me-) "I have no time for this."

Jewel: *She glanced at PKMY and the surrounding area.* "Teresa, move her out of the way and we'll tag team this disgusting tyrant!"

Teresa: "Indeed." *She hesitantly lowered the Pentarang and reached down to pick PKMY up.*

PKMY: "Memories.. Urhh.."

Teresa: *She noticed PKMY's skin sizzle and burn, causing her to discreetly gasp with widening eyes.* (What has Amy done to receive these burns?!)

*Teresa quickly analysed the burns, picking PKMY up.*

Teresa: (It is as if she has come into contact with a highly concentrated burst of Neurons? I do not see any Roharnia, thus, is not plausible?)

Ridley: (This fight could have turned out for the worst-) *He raised his hand, watching the tip of his fingers twitch.* (Regardless of my morals, I have no choice but to kill them all before my powers are drained to the moon.)

Jewel: *She flashstepped in front of Ridley.* "Take this-"

Ridley: *He looked up and smiled.* "Harh!" *He punched her in the face, causing an eruption of darkness to explode around her.* "Hmph-"

Jewel: *She stumbled back and suddenly warped into the air.* "Which one is the real one? Hee Tee." *Her voice echoed in every direction.*

Ridley: (Another illusion?)

Lance: *He started to breathe normally, causing him to stand up with a grunt.* (What's happening?)

Ridley: (She fools people by the eyes and hearing, and depending on her stamina even touch-) *He closed his eyes.*

Jewel: "Hee tee tee."

Ridley: *He opened his eyes and raised his arm, as a black sword puffed into his hand.* (I have no time for this, seriously-)

Lance: *He slowly exhaled through his mouth, wiping stress-induced sweat off his face.* (That was a shit feeling.. It felt like the same achin' you get from the flu.)

Ridley: "Found you-" *He shouted in a serious manner and flashstepped above the ground several feet away, violently ramming the sword into the vacant air.*

Jewel: "Kah-" *Her image warped and appeared in front of Ridley, silently staring at him with a dropping jaw.*

Ridley: *He landed on the ground, sighing in accomplishment.* "It's a shame I couldn't use your powerful illusions to my advantage."

Jewel: "H-How-?" *She spoke under her breath, as blood ran in between her eyes and down her nose.*

Ridley: "You can't fool me twice." *He let go of the sword and stepped back, watching Jewel struggle to stay on her feet.*

Teresa: *She held PKMY in her arms and gasped.* (Jewel's Neuron signature!-) *She quickly turned around, instantly noticing a black sword pierced through Jewel's head.*

Ridley: "This time, no more surprises, please. Astragons at my command, no mercy for the damned, with all my might, DARK STRIKE"

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She stood up and faced Ridley in anger, as her body glowed a shade of blue.* "Typhoon's-"

Jewel: *Darkness covered her head, causing tears to silently run down her cheeks.* (I'm sorry, Teresa-)

Ridley: *He turned around and clicked his fingers, causing the shadow to explode.* "Who's next?"

Teresa: "Jewel!"

Lance: "Sh-Shit." *He watched Jewel's body collapse to the ground with widening eyes, as terror filled his body.* (Her head just exploded!-)

Teresa: "You!" *She screamed in anguish.*

PKMY: *Her hair floated as if she was in water.* (This feeling-...) *She coughed out more blood and her vision blurred as she jumped in and out of consciousness.*

Lance: *He suddenly flashstepped and stood next to Teresa, facing Ridley with anger.* "I feel a little better from his last attack, let's kick his ass, aye."

Teresa: "Let's do it." *She grunted with growing rage, as Jewel's body disintegrated into tiny white orbs.*

Ridley: *He faced Teresa who raised the Pentarang and Lance whose lightning sparked in his hand.* "Did I strike a nerve?"

Lance: *He stepped forward and raised the lightning sword.* "Watev-"

*The Spacial Funnel warped and a clear image of a train appeared in it.*

Ridley: "Oh?" *He turned around with excitement and looked back to Teresa and Lance.* "A little more delayed than I expected-"

Lance: *He glanced at the Spacial Funnel and paused, tilting his head in disbelief.* (It can't be-)

Ridley: "But, I bid my farewell." *He smiled in happiness and flashstepped in front of the Spacial Funnel.*

Teresa: *She stared at the train, lowering the Pentarang in confusion.* "What is that Rosterology device?"

Lance: "I-It's a train."

Teresa: "A train?"

Ridley: "Finally!" *He stepped through the Spacial Funnel and his hair instantly blew back, as he stepped on the top of the moving train.*

Lance: *He noticed a country-like landscape the train railed through.* "That's several suburbs away from Dee Highs!"

Teresa: "Tcch, come on!"

Lance: "D-Damn right!"

*Teresa and Lance flashstepped in front of the Spacial Funnel and braced themselves, watching Ridley walk down the train.*

Teresa: "We won't have long-"

Lance: "L-Long for what?"

Teresa: "Until the lack of Neurons and Astragons take its toll on us."

Lance: "G-Got it."

Teresa: "I do not believe I would have said this several months ago, but we fight as equals, comrades, Lance."

Lance: "Aye?" *He looked to his side, ignoring his rapidly blowing hair caused by the Spacial Funnel.*

Teresa: "I have no desire to experience any more loss of those that I value."

Lance: "Let's do this." *He nodded his head and stepped through the Spacial Funnel.*

Teresa: *She stepped forward and her hair and cape instantly blew back, as strong winds howled past her.* "What is this?" *She squinted her eyes and raised her arms, trying to block the wind.*

Lance: *He slightly lost balance as the train vibrated under his feet.* "Wat are you doin'!?"

Ridley: "Huh?" *He turned around in shock, as if he wasn't expecting their presence.* "You followed me? Haha, the folly! My powers aren't restricted here!"

Lance: "But, I got the advantage."

Ridley: "Oh?" *He glanced over his shoulder and stared into the distance, noticing several large buildings.* "Magnificent." *He unintentionally ignored Lance, smirking with accomplishment.*

Lance: *He looked past Ridley and noticed the buildings.* "Shit, we're heading into the city."

Teresa: *She looked behind her, noticing the warped air.* "At the very least, the Spacial Funnel is following us."

Lance: "Yea."

Ridley: "Come? I don't mind waiting, you'll eventually be drained of your Remenistal." *He chuckled to himself, focusing his attention back to Lance and Teresa.*

----------

*Swarms of Darkwings spiralled around Celest, Alicia and Lorilei in the air.*

Celest: "We have to take them out in one go!"

Lorilei: "But how? I'm getting tired."

Alicia: "W-We have no choice!"

Lorilei: "Oh my, you're right! I just have to deal with it." *She flapped her wings and spun around, watching the Darkwings spiral around her.*

Alicia: (They move like a school of water Scoldrants.)

Locki: "Pep.. Per.." *He mumbled under his breath, staring at her with watering eyes.*

Sofia: "Haheahe." *She giggled and looked down, staring at the vein-like extensions on her whip.*

Pepper: *She coughed out blood, causing Sofia to giggle in response.* "Foolish."

Sofia: "Foolish?" *She flicked the whip, causing it to become one.* "You're losing a lot of blood, so I'll let it slide, pawn." *She grabbed the whip with both hands and licked the blood off it.* "Hahehahe."

Pepper: *She smiled with satisfaction as blood continued to pour on to the ground.* "The end for you is near."

Sofia: *She noticed the large growing blood puddle underneath Pepper.* "You keep saying that, but I see your game over, it's inevitable."

Pepper: "Have you forgotten who is said to defeat you?" *She dragged her feet as she slowly turned around and chuckled, facing Sofia with her head tilted down.*

Sofia: *Her eyes widened.* "What of it?" *She hissed in frustration.*

Pepper: "How slovenly."

Sofia: "Excuse me?!"

Pepper: "Are you ready?" *Her garments slowly glowed and started to warp.*

Sofia: "For what?" *She stepped back and flicked the whip to her side, causing it to slap the air.*

Chapter 2: All for One

Ridley: (This is excellent.. Just as I theorised-) *He smirked at Lance and Teresa, watching his hair rapidly flap on his forehead.* (At the cost of The Rubistral Moon's drawbacks, my Neurons and Astragons are not fading away-)

*Ridley looked at his hand and formed a fist, chuckling to himself in thought.*

Ridley: (Not the very slightest.)

Lance: *He raised his lightning sword, staring at the black sword in Ridley's hand.* "Alright, let's get him."

Teresa: "Let us make this quick-" *She stepped forward and flashstepped, causing a momentary shift of the wind's current.*

Lance: "Aha." *He chuckled at Teresa's impatience and watched her suddenly appear behind Ridley.*

Ridley: *He watched Lance chuckle, causing him to frown.* "I don't see what you've got to be happy about-?"

Lance: "Pssht." *He jumped forward and ran towards Ridley with a fading smile.* "..."

Ridley: (Despite being the number one nuisance-) *He stared at Lance and smiled in a condescending manner.* (They're still easily manipulated-)

Lance: *He ran into striking distance, causing him to look serious.* (This guy can't last forever, look how many people he's already fought-)

Ridley: *He firmly held onto the sword and jumped forward, slashing across Lance's shoulder.* "Hmph-"

Lance: "Grr-" *The lightning flashed, as he blocked Ridley's strike.*

Ridley: "You've become faster! I was certain I just struck you then."

Lance: "Just shut up, will you?!"

Teresa: (Using Rostical would not be wise here-) *She stealthily stepped forward, noticing an opening in Ridley's stance.*

Ridley: "Why so cranky, Lance?"

Lance: *He slashed to the side, watching Ridley block his strike.* "Just. Shut. Up."

Ridley: *He held his sword out, watching Lance's lightning violently spark against it.* "Rude-"

Teresa: "Harh." *She raised the Pentarang and jumped forward, slashing Ridley down the back.*

Ridley: "Argh!" *His eyes widened in shock.* (She was behind!-) *He glanced over his shoulder at Teresa.* (Why didn't I notice?! Has this excitement gone to my head?)

Lance: "Ya better look at me!" *He grabbed the lightning with both hands and flicked it to the side, pushing Ridley's sword away.*

Ridley: "The folly-"

Lance: "Pssht, I don't know what that means, but-" *He dropped himself on the train's roof and jabbed the lightning towards Ridley's ankle.* "Hah."

Ridley: *He lifted his leg up, avoiding Lance's jab.* (Still primitive battle positions-)

Teresa: "Humph." *She sliced the Pentarang at blinding speeds across Ridley's head.*

Ridley: *He hunched forward and ducked under Teresa's swing, watching strands of hair blow past his head.* "M-My hair?"

Lance: "Harh!" *He tilted the lightning upwards, jabbing it forward.*

Ridley: *He quickly grabbed the lightning's tip with his hand and pointed the other at Lance's head.* "DARK-"

Teresa: "Shattering Slice." *She spoke in a calm manner and sliced the air downwards.* "Humph."

Ridley: *His eyes widened, as he threw Lance's lightning sword to the side.* (Blast it-)

Lance: "Huh-?"

Ridley: *He jumped forward on top of Lance, riding him along the train.* "Ah-?"

Lance: *He slid across the train, watching his lightning sword spark away.* (Dammit-)

Ridley: *He quickly looked behind him, watching the air shatter like glass.* (That was close, Terra-)

Lance: "Get off me! LIGHTNING BLAST" *He pushed his arm forward and a stream of lightning blasted through Ridley's shoulder and into the air.*

Man: *He drove in a blue car down a country-like road, bobbing his head and hand to the beat of the music.* "'Cause I'm acceptable my way-" *He chuckled and turned the radio down as the music finished playing.* "Man, that song pleases the one and only, Pierce."

Ridley: *He stared at the stream of lightning and grabbed Lance's wrist, causing it to crack several times.* (That hurts-)

Pierce: *He noticed a stream of lightning in the mirror, causing him to swerve off the road.* (What was that?!) *He popped his head out the window and stared at the passing train.* "Filming a movie? Right on!" *He smirked and nodded his head in approval, watching Teresa walk on the train.*

Lance: (LIGHTNING PULSE) *He grunted as rings of blue lightning spiralled around his wrist, causing Ridley to let go.* "Argh-"

Ridley: "Grr." *He raised the black sword, quickly jabbing it towards Lance's head.*

Lance: "Ah!" *He moved his head to the side and the sword sliced his cheek and ear.* (Shit!)

Ridley: (Close-.. It's stuck.) *He frowned in thought, wiggling the sword in an annoyed manner.*

*Several girls giggled inside the train, closely reading from one manga book, oblivious to their surroundings.*

Ling: "Hooh?" *She sat in the train by herself and look up to the roof, instantly noticing the tip of the black sword.* "Oooh?" *She lowered a schoolbook she was reading from and rested it on her lap, squinting her eyes at the sword.*

Teresa: *She flashstepped in the air above Ridley, watching him stand over Lance.* "Typhoon's Pulse." *She lowered the Pentarang and pointed her free hand down at Ridley, aiming at his head.*

Lance: *He noticed Teresa in the air, causing him to struggle.* "Ah, shit-"

Ridley: "Stop struggling, it will only hurt for a little bit-"

Lance: "Gah!-" *He hit Ridley with his elbow and rolled to the side, causing him to gasp in shock.* "C-Crap!" *His hair flapped at an angle as he leant over the edge, staring at the train tracks.*

Teresa: "Humph." *She pushed forward, causing the wind to momentarily blow around her.*

Ridley: "Hmm?" *He looked up and the roof suddenly exploded around him, as an immense blast of wind blew a hole in it.* "Ah-?"

*The hole created a vacuum-like suction, causing Ridley to stumble forward and fall into the train.*

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She flashstepped next to Lance and grabbed his shoulder, pulling him up.*

Lance: *He awkwardly nodded his head at Teresa.* "Th-Thanks-"

Teresa: "Come-" *She turned around and leapt down into the train.* (Every single action requires more Neurons and Astragons. I had to focus more Astragons than normal around my body to ensure maximum efficiency in my aerial performance-)

Ridley: "NIGHTSHADE" *He ran down the cart and pointed his arm behind him, as a stream of black lightning blasted towards Teresa.*

*The passengers screamed and yelled in shock as they all ducked their heads in response.*

Teresa: *She landed on the floor and noticed the lightning, crossing her arms in a defensive manner.* "Tcch-"

Lance: *He fell from the roof and collapsed in front of Teresa, gritting his teeth.* "MAGNETIC RUMBLE" *He shouted and raised his arm from the floor, causing a white shield to expand from his hand.*

Ridley: *He ran into the next cart and noticed security officers running towards him.* (People of justice?)

Teresa: *She watched the black lightning spark against the shield directly in front of her face, causing her hair to flap backwards.* (Ridley..)

*Teresa stared at Ridley's back, listening to the shield's rumbling thunder.*

Teresa: "He is getting away." *She grunted with impatience, catching Lance's attention.*

Lance: *He stood up, causing the shield to disintegrate with the black lightning.* "Is that impatience? An emotion, aye?"

Teresa: "Tcch." *She jumped on the top of a nearby chair in between two passengers.*

Bob: *He looked at the roof, staring at the hole in fear.* (What's happening?!)

Billy: "Ooooowh." *He froze in fear and slowly glanced up Teresa's leg, causing his nose to start bleeding.*

Teresa: (He will not get away-) *She jumped forward and ran on her toes on top of the seats towards the next cart.*

Lance: (Ha.) *He quickly ran down the cart, smirking at Teresa's unusual behaviour.*

Security Man: "Hey, you! Sit down! Are you causing a fuss?" *He noticed Ridley's black sword, causing him to tighten his grip on his handheld radio.*

Ridley: "No fuss at all-" *Shadows expanded from his arm in reaction to a hooded man on a nearby seat.* "Hmm? My darkness likes your presence?"

Hooded Man: "Get lost 'yo."

Ridley: *He flashstepped on a vacant seat in front of the hooded man, suddenly lunging the sword through his head.* "Justice-"

*Passengers screamed at Ridley and the security man dropped the radio in fear.*

Security Man: "H-He-He, teleported?!"
Woman: "Blood!" *She screamed in terror, avoiding eye contact with Ridley.*

Teresa: "Harh!" *She appeared on top of a chair behind Ridley and elegantly leant forward, slicing the Pentarang downwards.*

Ridley: *He quickly placed his foot on the window and pushed himself into the aisle, jumping out of Teresa's strike.* "I keep barely avoiding-"

*A flash of light shined off the metallic linings of the chairs around Ridley, causing him to glance to his side.*

Lance: "Harh!" *He lunged his lightning sword towards Ridley's face.*

Ridley: *He adjusted his footing and flicked the sword across, causing sparks to rain on a nearby woman.* "Grr-"

Bing: "Eeeek-" *She screamed at the sparks as she curled herself up into a ball.*

*The rows of chairs four isles from Teresa's swing, suddenly exploded in half.*

Teresa: *She pulled the Pentarang out of the floor with an emotionless face.* (I was not expecting him to use the area to his advantage-) *She glanced at the window to her side, noticing a crack in the grass where he placed his foot.*

Lance: *He watched several passengers roll off the chairs in terror.* (Shit, everythin' is so fragile-) "Oi, Teresa, be careful aye."

Teresa: *She raised her arm, ignoring the pieces of metal and plastic which snapped off the Pentarang.* "It is too confined-"

Ridley: "Hmph." *He smirked and clicked his fingers, causing a pulse of shadow to push Lance back.*

Teresa: "Tcch, Typhoon's-"

Ridley: "DARK STYX" *He pointed at Teresa and smirked.* "You know, I'll manipulate your attack right back at you."

Teresa: *She froze, undecided what to do.* (He is right-)

Lance: *He stumbled back and the train rocked, causing him to hit the ground.* "Shit nuggets!"

Ridley: "Haha." *He turned around and ran past the speechless security man and towards the next cart.*

Lance: *He jumped up in anger and stared at Teresa who raised the Pentarang behind her shoulder.* "Wat are ya doin'?!"

Teresa: "Air Pentaraid." *She threw the Pentarang and it sliced through the air down the aisle.*

Lance: "You can throw that thing? I guess it is shaped like a boomerang."

Ridley: *He noticed a cluster of women, causing shadow to swirl around his wrist.* "Oh? More villains."

Big Nose Woman: "Beat it, tosser."

Ridley: "Oh my." *He smirked in astonishment.* "HOLYSHADE" *He straightened his arm at the women, causing them to laugh.* "Oh?"

Big Nose Woman: "Holy shade?"

Crow Neck Sally: "Aha, you're a tad far from da comic store, luv."

Ridley: "Oh really? Thank you." *He smirked as white lightning sparked through their heads and into the chairs, exploding their limbs in the process.* "Marvellous-"

*A flash of light whooshed through the air and suddenly slammed Ridley on the side of the head, smashing him out of the train through the glass window.*

Ridley: "Ouch-" *He rolled down a grassy hill, as shards of glass spiralled around him.*

Teresa: (Direct hit.) *She watched the flash of light spiral back towards her.*

Lance: *He noticed Ridley tumbling across the road, causing him to run towards the window.* "How did he-?"

Teresa: "Go!"

Lance: "Shit-, right-, wateva." *He pushed his arm towards the window.* "THUNDER BOOM" *A clash of thunder shattered the glass, causing the air to vacuum outside.*

Woman: *She covered her ears in astonishment while squinting her eyes in a defensive manner.* (Superheroes?! Nah! They have to be making a show, where is the director?! This is dangerous!) *She watched Lance jump out of the window and tumble down a slope towards the road.*

Teresa: *She raised her arm and caught the returning Pentarang.* (How is he using Rostical without being exhausted?) *She pondered to herself at Lance before jumping out the window.*

Ridley: *He kicked the ground and jumped high into the air, causing a trail of dirt to sway from his boots.* (Hmm, at least I've reached my new city.)

*Ridley glanced to his side down the road and observed the buildings in excitement, watching cars drive by.*

Lance: "LIGHTNING BLAST"

Ridley: *He landed on the road and sighed at Lance, facing him with growing boredom.* "If you're going to be slightly frustrating, could you please use different Remenistal at least?"

Lance: "Eat some shit nuggets, loser!" *He pushed forward, blasting a stream of lightning towards Ridley.*

Ridley: "How old, how about I spice it up? DARK STYX" *He swirled his hands towards the lightning, causing darkness to envelop it.*

Teresa: *She flashstepped next to Lance, blowing a pulse of dirt around her.* "Magnanimity Decibel." *She crossed her arms and four flower-like glyphs rotated in front of her.*

*Teresa pushed forward and a barrage of blue flower petals sliced the air towards Ridley.*

Lance: *A car started beeping at him, as it drove up the road at a fast speed.* "Sh-Shit, get off the road!-"

Driver: "You get off the road, you halfwit!"

Ridley: *He warped the lightning and swayed his arms forward, blasting it back to Lance.* "Haha." *Shadow spiralled from his shoulder, causing him to look at the driver in the car.*

Driver: "I said, get off the road, you heap of shits!"

Ridley: "I see-" *He looked at the lightning, discreetly nudging his hands.*

Lance: *He watched the lightning blast back towards him, causing him to quickly raise his arm in response.* "MAGNETIC-"

Teresa: *She noticed the lightning suddenly stop, causing her to glance at Lance impressed.* "You can now shield attacks from afar?"

Lance: (Huh? Why did it stop-?) "I-It's not me, aye."

Ridley: *He motioned his arm and the lightning shot into the car, causing it to instantly explode high into the air.* "There."

Lance: *The force of the explosion knocked him across the road.* "Argh!"

Ridley: *He looked up and watched an explosion of flames swirl from inside the car, causing the shadow to fade away.* "Justice."

Lance: *He slid on one side of his face across the road, rolling onto the grass.* (My face bloody scraped across-, I hate this feelin'!-)

Teresa: *Her hair blew to one side, as she ignored the flames of the car.* (The lack of Astragons has affected this Azure Burst's startup time?) *She focused on the four glowing glyphs in front of her.*

Ridley: "Now-" *Blue flower petals suddenly swayed past him, slicing his arms, legs and chest.*

Teresa: "Humph." *She grunted in satisfaction, watching cuts form all over Ridley's body.*

Ridley: "Blast it! Swirling shadows flock, with the motion all will block, darkness strikes hearts with fear, NIGHT SPHERE"

Teresa: "I will continue this Azure until your body slices to pieces!"

Ridley: *A swirl of mist-like shadow swirled around him, forming itself into a barrier.* "Such anger, Teresa Seraph. It's not healthy to bottle it up." *He chuckled as the car hit the road and exploded again.*

Lance: *He slowly stood up and ignored the graze-like marks on one side of his face.* (Not good-) *He frowned, holding his shoulder in pain.*

Teresa: (I am being starved of Neurons and Astragons-) *She panted and started to sweat.* (It is taking its toll on me now-)

Ridley: *He clicked his fingers and the shield burst, pulsing away the flow of petals.* "Haha." *He faced the city and flashstepped out of the area, causing the road to crack where he stood.*

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She gritted her teeth and frowned, looking at Lance in frustration.* "Let us pursue him immediately."

Lance: *He shook his head, stepping onto the road.* "The city is huge, he could be anywhere!" *He lowered his arm, speaking in a defeated manner.*

Teresa: "Always troubling!"

Lance: "A-Aye?"

Teresa: "Who else would possess an energy signature here?!" *She grunted and faced the city before flashstepping off the road.*

Lance: "Oh.. Yea." *He looked awkward and watched the dirt swirl where Teresa stood before flashstepping into the city.*

Ridley: *His image suddenly appeared in front of a man.* "Hello."

Man: "Harh?" *He stopped and gave Ridley a strange look.*

Ridley: *He rammed the sword into the man's chest and smirked.* "You were quite the naughty gentleman. The shadow reacted to your presence the most so far-" *He paused and quickly looked behind him in a frustrated manner.* (Why haven't their powers been drained yet?!)

*Teresa and Lance flashstepped on a wide pavement, a street away behind Ridley.*

Ridley: *He heard the train breaking in the distance, which drifted his attention towards the top of a large pillar of stairs.* "Hmm?" *Shadow enveloped his entire body, causing him to smirk in disbelief.* (We've got a lot of work to do, there are so many impurities around here-)

Lance: "Smear upon the skies and envelop your might, thunder roar down, LIGHTNING PULSE" *He clapped his hands in front and a ring of blue lightning rumbled like thunder.* "Gah-"

*Lance pushed forward causing the ring of lightning to slowly rumble towards Ridley.*

Ridley: *He noticed people jumping away from the lightning in astonishment.* "You shouldn't freely use Remenistal like that, you could hurt the innocent people-"

Teresa: *She flashstepped on top of a car, causing all the windows to smash and shatter on to the pavement.* "Give it up!" *She panted, as sweat ran down her chin.*

Ridley: "I'd imagine it's hard to breathe-" *He turned around and smirked, purposely ignoring Teresa.*

Teresa: *She stared at Ridley's back, pointing her finger at him.* "Do not ignore me-"

Ridley: "Hmph-" *He ran towards the set of stairs in the distance, easily running out of the lightning's range.*

Lance: (My lightning doesn't move as fast as it usually does-)

*The lightning hit a nearby store and exploded the doors off their hinges, causing people inside to scream.*

Teresa: "L-Lance-" *She lowered her arm and sighed with fatigue.* "Surely you know, we can not let him escape-"

Lance: "I know, I know." *He sounded worried and looked up, watching Ridley jump over the stairs in one leap.* (At least he's headin' to the train station-) *He had glimpses of the Spacial Funnel.*

Teresa: "Tcch-" (I will merely slow him down, I must regain my composure and adjust to my handicap-) "Go, Lance! I will catch up!-"

Lance: "U-Umm, got it." *He took a deep breath and ran towards the stairs.*

*People walked into the street oblivious to what happened and they noticed Teresa on top of the car.*

Teresa: (When I was previously here, I did not use this amount of energy.. Our internal Neurons are running out of battery life..)

*The crowd whispered and pointed at Teresa, slowly clustering into small groups around the car.*

Teresa: "Tcch." *She bent her knees and flashstepped off the car.*

*The crowd around the car gasped in shock, as a large dent burst itself on the roof.*

Ridley: *He ran into the train station and directly towards a large group of people mixed with business and casual clothing.* "Now-"

*Ridley flicked the sword up and sliced two men from behind across the neck.*

Man: *He watched the men's head roll off their shoulders, causing him to yell at Ridley in shock.* "What?!" *He reached to his side under his jacket and pulled out a handgun.* "D-Damn you, freak!"

Ridley: *He stopped and looked at the man, noticing the handgun in his hand.* "Oh-?"

Man: "Arh." *He aimed the gun and pulled the trigger, shooting at Ridley.*

Ridley: *Sparks flashed off his shoulder, as the bullet fell to the ground.* "Hmm?"

Man: "Huh?" *He held the handgun in a frozen, confused-like state.*

Ridley: "A pebble?" *He looked down to the bullet and sighed in a bored manner, focusing his attention to the large group of people.*

Man: (Why hasn't he dropped to the floor-?)

Ridley: *He stepped to the side and started to run towards the man.* "How unfortunate."

Man: *He gasped at Ridley, aiming the gun at his head.* (Maybe I missed?!)

Ridley: "It's saddening you had to do such an act, my shadow isn't responding to you." *He mumbled to himself, pointing his hand at the man with the handgun.*

Man: (I'm off duty, I wasn't expecting-) *A black glyph drew itself on the ground underneath him and dark-blue strings shot up, wrapping his hands together.* "Bloody-?!" *The strings applied pressure, causing him to drop the handgun.*

Ridley: "An insult to attack your new ruler, guider, peacekeeper-" *He raised the sword and changed direction, running towards the large group of people.*

Man: *He looked down to the handgun, noticing the black lines on the floor.* (I can't break free! It's like rubber! What's with this strange graffiti-?!)

Ridley: (Die.) *He clicked his fingers and a dark spear shot up from the glyph, straight through the man's chest.*

Lance: *He flashstepped into the train station and panted, noticing the man collapse to the ground.* "Why isn't anyone runnin'?" *He mumbled to himself, watching Ridley run towards the large group of people.*

Teresa: *Her image appeared next to Lance and she bent down to catch her breath.* "Those Rosterology devices-" *She pointed to a train and watched it slow down, listening to its brakes screech.* "-Are quite loud-"

Ridley: "Haha." *He smiled in excitement and spun around, slicing off a woman's arm.*

Woman: "Argh!" *She screamed before collapsing onto the floor.*

Ridley: "Next-" *He twirled himself around and stabbed the sword into a man's face.*

Teenager: *He frowned in fright and readied himself to strike Ridley from behind.* (Does this twat think he's from a cartoon?!)

Ridley: *He suddenly flashstepped in front of the teenager, causing his beanie to flap off his head.* "So young, yet, so vile."

Teenager: *He looked at Ridley with widening eyes.* "What the f-?" *He squealed the last word, as his head sliced off his body.*

Ridley: *He quickly spun around, throwing the sword into a woman's neck.* "Justice feels sweet."

*A man in a wrestler's uniform watched Ridley from a bench, forming fists in disgust.*

Wrestler: *He stood up and grunted to several tough appearing men next to him.* "Let's take him, he's scrawny looking!-"

Ridley: "Oh?" *He spoke as if he could hear the man, watching the sword puff back into his hand.*

Wrestler: "I'll hold him and you guys grab the sword off him before the cops get here."

Ridley: "Cops?" *He flashstepped above the wrestler and sliced the air downwards, causing the ground to crack.*

*Ridley elegantly landed on the ground and stood up straight, smirking in satisfaction.*

Wrestler: "Kah!" *He threw up blood before falling towards the ground face-first.*

Ridley: "Any more villains that wish to be heroes?" *The group of people screamed and scattered the area around him.* "There's still.. Seven more people that need to be eradicated-"

*The concrete cracked, as blue flowers grew from the ground and blossomed.*

Ridley: "Oh? I'm not used to the wildlife here, they look familiar-" *One of the flowers behind him shot out a bullet of condensed sand.*

Teresa: "Flora Dasher." *She pointed at Ridley from a distance, squinting one eye in concentration.*

Ridley: *He flipped and ducked, avoiding the barrage of sand bullets.* (Terra!)

Lance: "This ain't kool.." *He took a deep breath, glancing at Teresa.* "He doesn't seem to be affected at all, aye."

Teresa: *A layer of sweat covered her face.* "I am getting quite tired."

Ridley: "MANIPULATE, DARK STATE" *He stamped his foot and a wave of shadow squished the flowers around him.*

Teresa: "T-Tcch, my Azure-" *She lowered her arm, frowning in exhaustion.*

Ridley: "Hmm." *He noticed clothing on the sword, causing him to pull a disgusted look.* (Leftovers of those that were eradicated.) *He flicked the sword in the air and watched the piece of fabric fall to his feet.*

*A train pulled into the next station, catching Lance's attention.*

Lance: "Huh?" *He looked at the train, instantly noticing the Spacial Funnel above it.* "There-"

Teresa: *She watched the train enter a tunnel, causing her to gasp.* "The contraption! It is gone!"

Lance: "No, it's just gone on the other side of the gate." *He pointed past a set of escalators and through a glass-like bridge, which connected the escalators together.* "There's a station just beyond it."

Ridley: *He turned around and faced Teresa and Lance, watching them stand in the distance.* (How troubling these children are-) "DARK STRI-"

*Shadow swirled from Ridley's shoulder, causing him to turn around.*

Ridley: "This level of evil is sickening-" *He looked up and noticed a man running up the escalator.*

Teresa: "Then explain to me exactly where the contraption is stationed."

Lance: "We've got about five minutes until the train leaves." (But they shouldn't leave, there's a big hole in the roof-) *He grunted in thought, triggering a flashback of Teresa jumping into the train.*

Ridley: *He stared at the man and slowly took several steps towards the escalator.* (Time has barely passed since being here, and I'm already striking massive judgement-)

Lance: *He flashstepped next to Ridley, slicing the lightning sword across his face.* "Hah."

Ridley: *Blood stringed across the floor from a burnt slash, which instantly appeared on his cheek.* "You got me."

Lance: *He skilfully swayed around Ridley in an evasive manner, suddenly dropping the sword in front of him.* "Air Slash."

Ridley: "Oh my-" *He jumped to the side and raised the black sword, slashing the visible air slice in half.* "Hmph."

Lance: (He cut it in half!) *He stared at Ridley and ran backwards, raising the lightning sword.*

Teresa: (Despite these conditions, Lance's Neurons just jumped up several stages!)

Lance: "Air Slash." *He sliced the air in front and a visible air slash carved itself a path towards Ridley.*

Ridley: "Again?" *He flicked the sword in front of his face and lunged forward, readying to hit the air slash.* "Harh!"

*Ridley blocked the air slash, causing sparks to scatter off his sword.*

Ridley: *His feet slid back, as winds blew in his face.* (Strong-)

Lance: (Come on, I gotta do this-) *He grunted to himself with impatience.* "THUNDER BOOM"

Ridley: *His sword violently vibrated.* (If move out of the way-)

*Ridley leant forward, causing him to stop sliding back.*

Ridley: (Then he'll probably charge directly towards me-) *He moved his body to the side, causing the air slash to slide along his sword and past him.*

Lance: *He watched Ridley elegantly step past the air slash.* (Damn, I put a lot of power into that one-)

Ridley: *He looked back and watched the air slash hit a nearby vending machine, causing it to explode.* "Marvellous-"

Lance: *He ran towards Ridley, causing the lightning sword to lose its stream and spark away.* "Almost!"

Ridley: "Almost? You essentially withdrew your weapon-"

Lance: "Harh!" *He clapped his hands together and a loud thunder rumbled through the air shattering nearby items containing glass.*

Ridley: "Loud-" *A pulse of thunder slid him back across the floor.* "You've accomplished nothing!"

Lance: *He ran into striking distance and straightened his arm at Ridley.* "LIGHTNING-"

Ridley: *His body glowed a shade of blue and he formed a fist.* "Harh!" *He punched forward.* "Bloody Eruption."

Lance: "Bloody wat?!" *Blood-like water splashed in his eyes, as Ridley punched him across the face.* "Gah!-" *He fell onto the ground and slid away from Ridley.*

*Swirls of newspapers wafted past Ridley in a strong cold breeze.*

Ridley: "What was the point of all that? Charging at me like the fool you are." *He smirked and rolled his eyes, shaking the blood-like water off his hand.*

Lance: "Gotcha in position!"

Ridley: "Position?"

Lance: "Now!" *He shouted, awkwardly lying on his side.*

Ridley: (Now?) "What are you talking about?" *He mumbled in confusion.*

Teresa: *She flashstepped next to Ridley, raising her arms.* "Bakana Flare."

Ridley: *He looked shocked.* "Your Ougi!-"

*An eruption of multi-coloured flames burnt and blasted Ridley into the air with incredible force.*

Lance: *He watched Ridley smash through the glass in between the escalators and through a large neon sign.* (Whoa-)

Teresa: *She watched sparks rain around the broken wires of the neon sign.* "..."

Ridley: *He slammed on the side of the train and spiralled across the roof directly into the Spacial Funnel.* (Argh!)

Teresa: (To think.. A last minute plan executed by Lance worked...) *She discreetly smiled in an impressed manner.*

--

Ridley: (Argh-) *The area warped around him and he instantly found himself staring at Lezard, Tyler, Cameron and Holland surrounding PKMY.* (Back here?!)

--

Lance: *He watched swirls of multi-coloured flames spiral in front of Teresa before extinguishing out.* "Y-You all good, aye?" *He stood up slightly intimidated.*

Teresa: (The projection of the force I aimed the Consultant in-) *She looked at Lance and nodded her head in accomplishment.* (It blasted him back into the Spacial Funnel-) "We have no time to lose."

Lance: *He ignored the sirens, which echoed in the background.* "I-I know-"

Teresa: (I am at my limit-) *She grunted and flashstepped out of Lance's sight.*

Lance: *He glanced around admiring the train station before a party of police officers ran into the station.* (Shit-) *He lowered his head and avoided eye contact, flashstepping out of the area.*

--

Ridley: "Those fools." *He shouted in anger and inhaled deeply, stepping away from the Spacial Funnel.* "I've decided-"

*Teresa and Lance stepped through the Spacial Funnel, instantly noticing Ridley with an angry face.*

Ridley: "I've decided I'm going to kill you here before I re-enter the Spacial Funnel!"

Lance: (He's pissed.) *He stepped back, ensuring Teresa was next to him.*

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She looked annoyed and slowly exhaled, facing Ridley with anticipation.*

Ridley: "I was at fault for being compelled by my Shadiatons! I should've focused on you two from the start and stopped you then and there!"

----------

Pepper: "I feel the fire, the flames burning in my soul." *She closed her eyes, as blue glyphs drew themselves all over her body.*

Locki: *He stared at the glyphs in amazement and astonishment.* "Th-Those markings-"

Sofia: *She noticed the glyphs on Pepper's body in confusion.* (They look like Self-inflicting Glyphs, but blue?)

Celest: *She firmly held onto her white sword and sliced four Darkwings in the air in front of her, watching them puff into dust.* "Aliciana, thy hardly feel Locki's aura. Go and heal him!"

Alicia: *She spun around and faced the mountain, noticing the swarm of Darkwings blocking her way.* "I-I can't-"

Lorilei: "LIGHTNING BLAST"

Celest: "Zougoi." *She raised her arms and closed her eyes.* "Number seven-hundred and eighty two, SYNTHUS-CELESTIC SUMMONCE AVALON" *Her entire body shined blue and warped, suddenly moving like liquid.*

Sofia: "Huh? What now?" *She gasped in frustration and leant to the side, looking up into the air.* "A sudden burst of Neurons and Astragons-"

*Sofia noticed several Darkwings plummet out of the sky surrounded by static electricity, watching them puff into dust.*

Alicia: *She watched Celest grow into a giant-sized set of pink armour.* (Wow-)

Celest: *She raised her arms above her head, watching a growing javelin materialise in her hands.* "Harh!" *She sliced downwards and a massive aura-like stoke sliced the Darkwings.*

Sofia: *She watched hundreds of dust-like clouds puff into nothing, causing her to frown in anger.* (My pawns!)

Lorilei: *She pointed at the clearing Celest created and shouted, alerting Alicia.* "Go!"

Alicia: *She frowned in determination and her wings moved like razor blades, blasting her across the sky.* (I won't give up!)

*Alicia spiralled in the air, diving directly towards the clearing Sofia stood in.*

Alicia: (Celest was right, I can hardly feel Locki's-)

Sofia: *She watched Alicia dive towards her.* (I will give you a game over just like Cassidy-)

Pepper: "Humph-"

Sofia: "Harh?" *She focused her attention back to Pepper.*

Alicia: *She took a closer look at the mountain and instantly noticed Sofia staring at a woman.* (Who is that?)

Pepper: "Alicia, stand back!" *She spoke and her voice echoed like it was on a speaker.*

Alicia: *She looked shocked and hovered in the air.* (I could hear her clearly-) "D-Do I know you?"

Pepper: "I say, Sofia, if you can't understand by now-"

Sofia: "Understand what?!" *She grunted with annoyance.*

Pepper: *Her clothes suddenly scorched with bright white flames and a gust of wind unnaturally blew them off her body.* "It slightly displeases me you have yet to understand."

Sofia: "W-Where did those flames come from-? Put some clothes on!"

Alicia: (Is that Pepper? She looks older than me!)

Pepper: *Her skin became a fluoro teal colour, causing her to smirk.* (The Sacred Knights-)

*The sun's light slightly dimmed, causing the area to become darker.*

Sofia: *She looked around startled.* (It's dark? Is she using an Ougi?!) "I'm not going to sit here and watch you power-up! Hahehahe!" *She jumped towards Pepper and tightly held the whip's handle.*

Pepper: "I feel it-" *She gasped, moaning with pain and pleasure.*

Sofia: "Freak?!" *She flicked the whip towards Pepper's face.*

Pepper: *She spread her arms to each side, causing light to glitter from the sky.* "My memories!" *The glittering light swirled down around her waist.*

*A ball of light materialised in the air above Pepper and slowly descended towards her chest.*

Sofia: *She smirked, as the whip slithered through the air towards Pepper's forehead.* (With this attack, the whip will go straight through her head!)

Pepper: *The ball of light pulsed over her body, causing warm gusts of wind to waft around her.* "..."

*The whip touched Pepper's forehead and suddenly stopped, blasting away in a repelled-like manner.*

Sofia: "Harh?" *She watched the whip wobble back in confusion.* (It didn't penetrate?!)

Locki: *He smiled, watching the glittering light continue its spiral-like cluster around Pepper's waist.* "The light is filled with Radiatons, Astragons and Neurons."

Alicia: *She watched the ball of light merge into Pepper's chest, noticing her skin ripple like water.* (What is that?)

Locki: *He watched the ball of light completely go into Pepper's body, causing him to gasp in realisation.* "The Philosopher's Heart! Thy knew it! Pepper is..."

Pepper: *The swirls of glittering light made serenity sounds, as strings of robes materialised around her legs and arms.* "The power of the spirits within me-"

Alicia: "C-Clothes are being materialised on to her body without a Rosterology device!"

Sofia: (What is this power?!) *She intensely stared at Pepper with widening eyes.* "You're somehow skipping levels!"

Pepper: "Awaken!" *The blue glyphs on her body shined a fluorescent colour, as arcs of golden light clustered in the air.*

Sofia: *A blast of energy flicked the surrounding branches and leaves back.* "W-What is going on?!" *She started to sweat with frustration and anxiety, as her ponytail rapidly blew backwards.*

Pepper: *She swiftly lifted her leg into the air and spiralled around, as her hair and robes elegantly twirled around her.* (Sacred Knights, thy require your power!)

*Strings of bright white light twirled around Pepper's shoulders, as armour attached themselves on top of her robes.*

Locki: (Impossibly magnificent.. Thy don't even know if that makes sense, but that's what thy feel.) *He watched the air glitter around Pepper in amazement.* (The honour, pride, glory, valour, what we, as The Sacred Knights fight for!)

Alicia: (It's beautiful-) *She stared at Pepper with glittering eyes, due to the different sorts of light which spiralled around her.*

Pepper: "Hermph-" *She continued to spiral in a graceful manner, as golden light shined the colour of her armour.*

Sofia: (Golden armour?!)

Alicia: "The light's colour went into the armour?" *She spoke under her breath in amazement.*

Pepper: "Harh." *She tapped her toe on the ground and she spiralled into the air, as swirls of dove feathers blew around her.*

Sofia: *She gasped with widening eyes, unintentionally gripping onto the whip's handle with anxiety.* (Even with my love's affinity, her power is nearing mine! And it's continuing to rise!)

*Whirlpools of crystal clear water strung and splashed from the surrounding trees.*

Sofia: *She watched a stream of water swoosh past her.* (Is she absorbing their liquids like my whip?)

Pepper: (Cleanse divine water!) *The water swirled around her long golden hair, causing it to appear shiny as if it was gelled.*

Alicia: (Pepper's movement..) *She admired Pepper's new, shiny-like hair, triggering a flashback.*

-

*Alicia and Lance walked past several shops with differently-sized televisions, illuminating the glass display they sat behind.*

Alicia: *Lights from the televisions caught her attention.* "H-Huh?" *She mumbled to herself and faced the glass, focusing her attention to one screen.*

Lance: *He stopped, looking at Alicia.* "Oh, this isn't Adventure Land-"

Alicia: "Wow." *She stared at the screen showing an animated television show.*

Lance: *He walked behind Alicia, looking at the screen with a smirk.* "I like fantasy stuff." *He nervously announced, holding onto her waist.*

Alicia: "It's pretty." *She smiled, causing Lance to smile comfortably.* "The lady-" *She pointed to the glass, watching strings of light spiral around a woman.* "She's transforming?!"

Lance: "That's Sailor Eclipse or something, they fight bad guys under moonlight 'n' stuff." *He sniffed and pretended to be cool, watching the credits roll up.*

Alicia: "Wow." *She quickly faced Lance amazed, causing him to chuckle with blushing cheeks.*

Lance: "A-Aha, yeah." *He awkwardly smirked, scratching the side of his head.*

-

Alicia: (This, she-.. She looks just like that!)

Pepper: *Yellow lights which looked like stars flashed around her lips causing them to become glossy.* (Hear my thoughts my einherjar!) *Her voice echoed to the party members around her.*

Sofia: "Open your eyes and stop this ridiculous show of flashing lights! If you're going to attack me, then do it!" *She screamed angrily, effectively hiding her fear.*

Pepper: *She spiralled to the ground and a pulse of pale light shined off her skin.* "Attack thou?"

Sofia: "Y-Yeah!"

Pepper: *The light slowly returned to the area and she opened her eyes, causing droplets of water-like sparkles to scatter past her face.*

Sofia: "You even have sparkling tears? All this is for show!-"

Pepper: "Thy will not attack thou."

Sofia: "Haheahe, because you're weak!-"

Pepper: *She looked at Sofia with her surreal fluoro teal-coloured eyes.* "Thou will not be attacked, thou will be slaughtered-" *She dropped her arms, causing a pulse of dove feathers to spiral around her.*

Sofia: "W-W-What-?" *She stepped back and frowned.*

Locki: "The.. Valkyrie..." *He spoke under his breath, as if he was privileged to witness her transformation.*

Sofia: "How dare you! You know the powers I wield?!"

Pepper: "Thy say, thy do understand what level your Radiagenicons and somehow Shadiagenicons are at, they are pitiful." *She raised her arms to look at her hands, noticing her robes, armour and body shine in the light.*

Sofia: "Pepper!"

Pepper: "Hoh?" *She spoke calmly and looked at Sofia with a solemn face.* "The markings of the selected Sacred Knights will be returned to me."

Sofia: "W-What-?!"

Pepper: *She clicked her fingers and Locki, Alicia, Lorilei and Celest appeared in line on the ground beside her.* "One missing?"

Celest: *She looked at Pepper slightly disoriented.* "Mistress-?"

Pepper: "No matter-" *She waved her arm across The Sacred Knights and they all fell unconscious.*

Sofia: (What is she doing!?)

Pepper: *The 'S'-shaped tattoo shined on her forehead.* "This vessel has now been completely healed." *Five more sets of the 'S'-shaped tattoo materialised and spiralled around her own, forming a circular-shaped glyph.*

Sofia: "Vessel? Healed? You can die." *She angrily held the whip with anticipation.*

Pepper: "Impossible."

Sofia: *She showed her teeth, grinding them in anger.* "Tell me what just happened!? You aren't Pepper, are you?! You're strong but not this strong!"

Pepper?: *She took a step forward, causing bright green grass to form around her foot.* "Thou witnessed the awakening of the Valkyrie."

Sofia: "Gah!" *She stepped back as a wave of terror filled her body.*

Valkyrie: "Thy can feel the emotions resonating from thou."

Sofia: *She frowned in anger, snapping the whip to her side.* "Unless you're empathic, that's impossible!"

Valkyrie: "The flow of Radiagenicons is filled with emotions." *She chuckled in a condescending manner, causing Sofia to scream in anger.*

Sofia: "Valkyrie? Reading my emotions?!"

----------

Lezard: *He sighed in a serious manner, gently placing the cone-shaped hat on the ground beside him.* (I have to do this for you.. Although I don't like violence, I have to do it.)

Tyler: "What's wrong, Lezard?"

Lezard: "Radiatons weren't the only thing I was blessed with.. I also obtained my mother's Grand Remenistal."

Tyler: "S-Sorry?"

Lezard: "..." *He shook his head as if it didn't matter.*

Cameron: "We have not even executed our plan to bind him." *He mumbled with failure, staring at Teresa and Lance's back.*

Holland: "Amy, Amy.." *He held PKMY in his arms and stared at her in a worried manner, mumbling under his breath.*

PKMY: *She twitched into consciousness and opened her eyes, looking around with a dizzy-like stare.* "Everyone's emotions, they're getting stronger-"

*PKMY wheezed in pain and looked at each party member, as if she was overwhelmed by their presence.*

Holland: "What's getting stronger? Their emotions? What is happening to you? I thought you completed the training?!"

Ridley: "So, who should I kill first?"

Teresa: *She panted and looked at Lance.* "His tone sounds different."

Lance: *He ignored Teresa, shouting at Ridley.* "Obviously you're the one that's goin' to go down-"

Lezard: "Lance! Teresa! Brace yourselves for the Rasticsplash!" *He stood up and raised his arms into the air, catching Lance's attention.*

Lance: "The Rosticksplash?" (He's just a healer?) "What healin' moves could-?"

Lezard: "Pockets of fire, burn, blazing havoc scorch-"

Ridley: "Hmm?" *The area became black, causing him to look around annoyed.*

Lezard: "Change the glyphic seals-" *Red glyphic symbols and seals materialised in the air around him.* "Pour down, pour your heart's content with all you got!-"

Teresa: (This Neuron signature!) "Lance, be careful!"

Lance: "Aye? OK." *He nodded his head in respect, standing in a defensive manner.*

Lezard: "FADING SUNS"

Ridley: "Fading Suns? Where have I heard that before?"

Lezard: "Arh." *He yelled at the sky and a beam of yellow magma crashed down on top of Ridley.*

*Plumes of fire flared in front of Lance and Teresa, causing them to grunt with shock and anticipation.*

Lance: (I can feel bursts of cold then hot air-)

Season: *He watched Lezard drop to the ground unconscious, causing the magma and area to revert back to normal.* "Even though PKMY somehow started to heal us-" (I'm still too weak to fight-)

Tyler: *He panted and pushed himself towards Lezard, quickly inspecting him.* "H-He's breathing-"

Ridley: "That's it!" *He swayed to the side, blowing a wave of smoke and splinters of fire away.*

Lance: *He looked at Ridley and noticed half of his face was burnt, causing him to look surprised.* (Wow, who knew Lizard could actually do that-)

Ridley: "Now, I'm actually mad!" *He glared at Teresa and Lance, causing the grass to swirl around him.*

Lance: "I'm not waitin'! LIGHTNING-"

Ridley: "Get out of my sight!" *He shouted in anger and stamped his foot, causing an eruption of darkness to blow Teresa and Lance towards the party.*

Lance: "Garh-" *He blasted into the air, coughing out a puff of shadow-like smoke.*
Teresa: "H-Hor-pmh-" *She blasted through the air, crossing her arms in a defensive manner.*

PKMY: (The drive, the power!) *She started to whimper with sadness, happiness, excitement, fear and anger.*

Holland: (Amy... What's wrong with her?!)

Freya: (I don't know... I can't sense what she's experiencing..?)

PKMY: (I feel you all!)

*Lance and Teresa tumbled across the ground and stopped in front of the party.*

Season: "Teresa, Lance!" *He grunted, trying to stand up to their aid.*

Teresa: *She grunted and pushed herself up off the ground, watching sweat drip off her face.* (This is not good.. I have replenished the Neurons and Astragons lost.)

*Teresa's knees buckled, causing her to look at her hands in confusion.*

Teresa: (Yet, I am still exhausted.. I have clearly underestimated what I have endured the past few days.)

PKMY: "Teresa.."

Teresa: *She looked behind her to PKMY.* "Not now."

PKMY: "But, this power, it's burning me-" *She moaned in agony, causing Holland to grunt in frustration.*

Lance: "Blah-" *He spat out dirt and slowly stood up, frowning at Ridley.* "Right, you're angry, so am I aye!"

Season: *He looked at Lance and Teresa, observing their posture in a curious manner.* "Lance, did you let Teresa do all the work?"

Lance: "Aye?"

Teresa: "No, why do you ask?"

Season: "You're fatigued, while Lance isn't."

Lance: "I dunno-"

Ridley: "I've got it!" *He chuckled in realisation, slowly raising his arms.*

Teresa: (Now that Season has brought it to my attention-) *She focused her attention back to Ridley, standing in an exhausted battle-ready pose.* (Why is Lance's stamina superior to mine?)

Ridley: "I thought they had mixed, but I was wrong-" *Black lightning sparked in one of his hands, while white lightning sparked in the other.* "They merely accepted each other."

Teresa: "He appears to be taunting us, I will take advantage of the situation and strike."

Lezard: *He moaned, which caught Tyler's attention.* "D-Did, Lezard do it?"

Tyler: "Save your energy-" *He reached into his RPG bag and pulled out another sack of Acro Berries.*

Ridley: "Knowing this also explains Madora's illusive powers! Hahahahahaha." *He chuckled in disbelief and clapped his hands together, watching the two coloured lightning form into one.*

Teresa: *Her eyes shined golden, causing her to raise the Pentarang which re-materialised back into her hand.* "I see an opening!" *Her image disappeared and she reappeared behind Ridley.* (I will silently strike-)

Ridley: *A pulse of aurora light flickered in front of his hand.* "Bahahaha."

Lance: *He noticed the glimpse of aurora light, causing him to look around.* "Old fart? The granny's here?"

Ridley: "So, this whole time-" *His image disappeared and he suddenly reappeared directly in front of Teresa.* "She had shadow and light too?"

Teresa: *She looked at Ridley with widening eyes.* "What was that light-?"

Ridley: "Aurora element?" *He grabbed Teresa's shoulder and violently threw her towards the party.*

Teresa: (What-?!) *She landed heavily and tumbled across the ground, causing her to land awkwardly effectively breaking her wrist.* "Tcch!-"

Season: (I heard a bone breaking!)

Lance: *He glared at Ridley, triggering flashbacks of the entire fight.* (How much more can this guy tank!?)

Ridley: *He landed on the ground with an enormous smirk, watching Teresa slide on her side.* "This power!" *He clicked his fingers and swirls of aurora flashed around his hands.*

PKMY: "G-Kah!" *Her eyes moved from side to side.*

Holland: "What's happening?!"

PKMY: "Everyone's memories."

Teresa: *She rolled on her side and coughed, causing her hair to sway in her face.* "H-His power-" *She moaned under her breath and withdrew her left hand, causing Lance to run over to her.*

Lance: "Teresa."

Teresa: "His power is twice as strong as it was before!"

Ridley: "I wonder!-" *He flicked his hands and an explosion of aurora cracked the ground in the distance.* "Hahaha, exceptional!"

PKMY: "Everyone's memories!" *She screamed and curved her back upwards out of Holland's hands.* "It burns!"

Lance: *He looked over his shoulder, staring at PKMY in shock.* "Wat's happenin' to her?"

Holland: "Oh, you know, besides being stabbed through the chest!" *He unintentionally yelled at Lance with anger.*

Lance: "T-True.." *He spoke in an apologetic manner and helped Teresa up, slowly walking towards PKMY.*

Season: "It seems she acquired some sort of power-up, a mixture of our abilities, but her capacity can't take it."

Teresa: (Something to do with her empathic powers?)

Cameron: "We do not have time to figure out her condition, our opponent-"

Lance: *He looked over his shoulder, watching Ridley play with the aurora in his hands.* "It looks like he's busy for now."

Cameron: *He gritted his teeth, glancing at each party member.* "...-"

Apollo: (Cameron?)

Cameron: (The best option to take would be to retreat-)

Apollo: (But, Cameron-)

Cameron: (I understand. It is not a plausible action we can take.)

PKMY: "Memories-"

Holland: "You keep saying that." *He shouted at PKMY, pouting in a helpless manner.*

Lance: *He stared at PKMY, observing her with an emotionless face.* (She's starting to sweat-)

Tyler: "Sh-She's looking really pale." *He unintentionally kept his voice low, trying to avoid eye contact with Ridley.*

Lezard: *He awkwardly chewed on the Acro Berries, glancing at PKMY.* "This is no good.. Who the fishcakes will tell me off now?"

Lance: "Teresa or Season, you guys are usually good with this shit?" *He spoke in a worried manner, watching Season shake his head.*

Teresa: "I sense her Neurons are dangerously fluctuating." *She stepped forward and lost balance, causing Lance to catch her.*

Lance: (I think.. We might not win-) *He thought with anger and frustration.* (The good guys are meant to win.)

Teresa: *She coughed and breathed through her mouth.* "Also-" *She glanced at PKMY with a worried look.* "The bonding with Astragons are also fluctuating."

Lance: "Wat does that mean?!" *He grunted.*

Season: "From what I'm gathering-" *He coughed and wiped blood from his mouth.* "She's releasing abnormal amounts of Neurons in her body."

Tyler: "The bonding with Astragons? That means she's absorbing Astragons or releasing them?"

Cameron: "Why can she not turn off whatever is causing this condition?"

Holland: "I think she could normally, but with those wounds-" *He mumbled and stopped in mid-sentence.*

Lance: "I still don't understand?"

Teresa: "From what I am seeing and sensing-" *She paused with widening eyes, catching Season's attention.*

Season: "Teresa?"

PKMY: "I can see it, it's like I'm there!"

Lance: "Oi?" *He looked at Teresa, implying for her to continue.*

Teresa: "She is either going to die-"

Season: (No!-)

Holland: (Amy?)

Tyler: "Or?"

Teresa: "Or, she is going to lose her ability to use Rostical." *Her words caused Season, Tyler and Lance to gasp.*

Holland: (Amy, no!) *He scrunched his eyes shut and gritted his teeth.*

PKMY: "M-Memories-" *She leant up with a gasp, releasing a pulse of wind around her.*

*The wind pulsed across the party, causing them to gasp at the same time.*

-

Wendy: "Whoa-" *She took a step back, lowering the bow in shock.*

Season: *He stamped his foot, causing a pulse of water to splash around his ankle.* "AQUATIC DIVIDER"

Wendy: "I-Is that, Grand Rostical?"

Ashton: "Grand-?"

Teresa: "Grand Rostical is a stage above normal Rostical."

Lance: (Although this is going to get nerdy, I find that pretty kool.)

Teresa: "Grand Rostical can only be used by someone who excels at Rostical, or possesses a Pure Jade, which is a powerful Rosterology item with condensed ons."

Ashton: "..." *He closely observed the water around Season's foot in amazement as it continued to gush out of the ground.*

Teresa: "Or, once mastering a specific Rostical, the user can formulate a stronger variant."

Ashton: "Resulting in Grand Rostical?"

Teresa: "Precisely. And lastly, one who is near death is able to use all their Astragons and Neurons at will."

Lance: "We didn't say anythin' and you still give us a crappy explanation."

Teresa: "Such immaturity is tiresome to be around for so long."

Lance: "Pssht, wateva."

Ashton: "Thank you, Teresa, for the explanation."

-

PKMY: "Stuff this! It's still growing in size!-" *She threw one of the Ryukkus on the ground and straightened her arm.* "Ougi."

Lizard-tongued Woman: "An Owgi?" *She looked intrigued, speaking in a snake-like manner.*

PKMY: *She opened her hand and braced herself, ramming the Ryukku through it.* "Incantation Exploitation."

Chrisma: "Get in!-" *She gasped in fright as if she wasn't expecting PKMY to stab herself.*

*The chief and tribal members looked at each other in shock, focusing all their attention on PKMY.*

Alicia: "Ougi?" *She whispered to herself in surprise, biting her bottom lip.*

PKMY: *She threw the Ryukku to her side, causing it to slide across the ground.* "Let's see wat its reaction will be?"

*Cameron and Holland felt their tribal markings in shock, causing them to glance at PKMY with surprised faces.*

Cameron: (This woman, is she a Scoldrant User too?)

-

Keno: "Holland." (This is the only way to make you understand.)

Holland: *He gathered his attention to Keno.* "Yeah?"

Keno: "I will show you the power gap in our powers." *He stepped back and faced his Scoldrant, causing a blue string to materialise between them.*

Holland: *He lowered his hands, causing Freya to jump into his arms.* (What's the difference? It looks the same-)

Keno: "Kosmo-"

*Hundreds of golden strings suddenly materialised between them, causing Freya to yelp in shock.*

Keno: "What you're seeing now, is the connection between every available Neuron and Astragon point, gate and slot."

Holland: *He looked shocked and amazed with widening eyes.* (They're golden-)

Keno: "When your bond forms even further-"

Holland: *He watched Kosmo suddenly disintegrate into nothing, causing him to gasp.* "What happened to-?!"

Keno: *He stood up straight, forming fists in a powerful-like manner.* "..."

Holland: "What happened-?"

Keno: *He chuckled, raising his hands.* "You have no idea what our kind can do-"

Freya: "Grr-" *She growled at Keno, causing Holland to pat her head.*

Keno: *He stared at Holland, as a large green glyph spiralled above him.* "This is the power of a Soul Link-"

*A Scoldrant made of wood suddenly appeared in front of Holland, binding him in vines.*

Holland: "Ah!-" *He looked shocked, staring at Keno in confusion.*

Keno: "Barck, enough."

Barck: "..." *It looked over its shoulder and nodded its head before disintegrating into nothing.*

-

Tarlea: "You have your father's ability."

PKMY: *She sniffed and looked at the blood around her hand, recalling the time she used her Ougi.* "Using no incantations to-?"

Tarlea: "Your empathic ability, learn how to control it." *She bent forward and hugged PKMY, scratching behind her head in a motherly manner.* (Look for a woman named Arcadia.)

PKMY: *She nodded her head and looked at Tarlea, as if she was going to cry.* "I missed you, mummy."

Tarlea: "I've missed you too." (Your ability can take down Ridley, even The Sacred Knights are jealous of your power.)

-

Kairi: "But I'm serious though, Luna. I'm sorry for not being truthful, and I'm sorry to not having the means to sealing your abilities."

Luna: "My abilities? Why?"

Kairi: "You were born after we started our new lives on Earth. Firstly, we didn't exactly know what would happen to children born of an Elementalist and a Remenistal User, but we figured since Earth has no Neurons or Astragons, it wouldn't affect you."

Luna: "Yea?" *She implied she wanted to know more.*

Kairi: "There is no reason, evidence or science that can currently explain my intuition, but the moment you started shutting yourself away, I knew it was dormant Neurons and Astragons at work."

Luna: *She cupped her mouth and nose with both hands.* "Don't think science can explain a blind chick seein' through the eyes of a Scoldrant, aye."

Kairi: "Yeah.." *She spoke with a smile.*

Luna: "Throughout the years, some people related to Scoldrant Users can't explain why or how I'm a Scoldrant User."

Kairi: *She nodded her head in agreement.* "It's usually a hereditary ability to Soul Link with Scoldrants, but Leon used to hypothesise these little what ifs all the time. He used to think, what would happen if someone entered our world without Neurons and Astragons? What happens when someone is born? What makes their elemental affinity? What makes them eventually acquire the Azure Bursts they'll be able to use?"

-

Rachael: "What's your theory?"

Dawn: "Thank you, research-" *She spoke under her breath and dropped to her knees as drone-like machines burst into white liquid.*

Ginger: "Well, think of our limits as one container. But, in Luna's condition-"

PKMY: "Condition-?"

Season: "Continue." *He mumbled, rubbing his chin in an interested manner.*

PKMY: (Wateva.)

Ginger: "I believe she has two containers. So her potential is twice as much as ours."

Luna: (Wat's she tryin' to say?)

Destiny: (I think she's complimenting you?)

Season: "Why do you believe Lance has two of these containers?"

-

Muffin: *She held her arms above her head, looking back to the fire.* "We are mixing a splice of elements into the fire-"

Cakes: "To make the fire yum yum for the foods in our tum tum."

PKMY: "Wat are you on..?"

Jester: "We're just adding elements into the fire to make the food extraordinary."

Berry: "Water." *He shouted out and watched a small blue glyph rotate in front of his hand.*

Pepper: *She watched the green fire dance into a swirling cluster of purple flames.* "Wow!"

PKMY: (Impossible?!) *She stared at the purple fire in disbelief.*

Jester: "It's ready." *He announced in a triumphant manner.*

PKMY: "How is the fire changing colour?"

Jester: "Exactly what we just said?"

PKMY: "I haven't heard or seen this technique used anywhere, what do you call it?"

Berry: "We haven't named it anything."

Cakes: "We have acquired it through the ages."

Jester: "Not to sound like we're talking down to you, but you can't learn the Elemental Splicing."

Pepper: "Elemental Splicing? Isn't that a name?"

PKMY: "Heh?" *She smirked at Pepper, grunting in respect.*

Jester: *He paused.* "I suppose it is." *He awkwardly adjusted his hat.*

PKMY: (So, that strange Rostical Teresa used, must've been what they call Elemental Splicing.) "What was the Rostical called? Serenity something.." *She mumbled to herself, rubbing her chin in thought.*

-

Lance: "A thin layer of mist covered the old, damaged, decaying floors."

Holland: (Just like Millard..) *He smiled at Lance and looked down the massive hallway, noticing many rooms on each side.*

Tyler: (Lance describing the scary environment is making this scary place even more frightening! I can feel my heart pounding.) *He whimpered in thought, tightly holding onto Alicia.*

Holland: *He nudged Lance, looking behind him at Tyler and Alicia.* "Which one is the bigger girl?"

Lance: "Aha." *He smirked, continuing to walk down the hallway.*

?????: "Elementalist." *A voice whispered in the mist, catching Lance's attention.*

Lance: "D-Did you hear that?" *He stopped, looking around frightened.*

Tyler: "This is no time for jokes, Lance."

-

*Wendy and Mindy's charcoaled bodies lay on the floor.*

PKMY: *She lay on the floor motionless, taking a deep breath to recollect her composure.* "We.. How..?"

*PKMY slowly placed her hands on the floor and pushed herself up, watching steam sizzle off the tiles.*

PKMY: "Th-That was not his power.." *She gently touched the side of her face, feeling a graze-like burn mark on her cheek.*

*Lance awkwardly lay on the floor with holes burnt through his clothes which puffed out smoke.*

PKMY: (Nothing can harm us! We adjust our Astragenicons' coating due to knowing the true potential of who calls upon us, that attack obviously exceeded his own-) *She clicked her fingers, which instantly restored her appearance.* (-Which is the sole reason why we were damaged in the process.)

-

*A man walked into Alicia's village, observing the fire-based damage.*

?????: (I was too late?)

Karol: "Lezard?!" *He ran into the village, tripping on his own foot.* "Oof-" *He fell to the ground, coughing out dirt.*

Lezard: "Karol, I was too late." *He walked forward, continuing to observe the destruction of the village.*

Karol: "Umm-"

Nathan: *He walked over Karol and grunted, picking him up with one hand.* "Were we really too late?"

Trevour: *His armour rattled, as he staggered into the village.* "Whoa, this situation looks temperamental!" *He mumbled in shock, staring at the glass on the ground.*

Karol: *He brushed dirt off his pants, looking at Nathan.* "F-Fanks, Nafan."

Nathan: "Lezard?" *He mumbled, sympathising with Lezard.*

Lezard: *He noticed Millard's cone-shaped hat, causing him to rub his arm in a comforting manner.* "He was here."

*Nathan, Karol and Trevour walked towards Lezard, watching him pick up the hat.*

Lezard: "I will avenge my mother and father's death." *He brushed charcoal off the hat, placing it on his head.*

-

Raphael: "Kah!-" *He shouted causing golden strings to visibly swirl out of his body.* (These Soul Links!)

*The golden strings extended from Raphael, attaching themselves to Pepper and Cassidy.*

Cassidy: (Thy can feel their heartbeats-) *He gasped and smiled, watching golden strings connect to Lorilei.*

Pepper: (This feeling is indescribable.) *She whispered in amazement, as the golden strings connected to Locki.*

Woman: "Thank you." *She looked down, watching her grey hair swirl in her face.*

Pepper, Locki, Lorilei, Raphael and Cassidy: "The Sacred Knights, purity of spirits, we alone will purify the doubts in your heart."

*The air suddenly blurred with power, giving the appearance it was raining.*

-

Millard: "Even if there was a chance you could find her, you'd need to go to Silver Wind Island or join the warriors."

Rachael: "No way we're joining the warriors."

Millard: "I don't blame you." *He spoke of relief as if he didn't want them to.*

Twortz: "..."

Karol: "They're bad peeple."

Rachael: "I have a question we kinda skipped."

Millard: "Yes, little monster?"

Rachael: "What is different between an Elementalist and a Rostical User?"

-

Ginger: "I have a theory, please respond?" *She glanced over to Luna, catching her attention.*

Luna: *She walked up to the guild, looking at Ginger in a curious manner.* "Yea, you've got my permission to speak."

Destiny: "Yeup." *She hovered behind Luna, landing on her shoulder.* (Be nicer, Luna.)

Luna: (Wateva. I'm too tired to give a shit.)

Rachael: "What's your theory?"

Dawn: "Thank you, research-" *She spoke under her breath and dropped to her knees as her drone-like machines burst into white liquid.*

Alan: "It looks like we've finally cleared those things out of the city."

Rosemary: *She coughed into her elbow and nodded her head, as floating boulders merged back into the ground.* "Oh my, I'm so tired."

Frog Woman: "Me too, ribbit."

Ginger: "Well, think of our limits as one container. But, in Luna's condition-"

PKMY: "Condition-?"

Season: "Continue." *He mumbled, rubbing his chin in an interested manner.*

PKMY: "..."

Ginger: "I believe she has two containers. So her potential is twice as much as ours."

Luna: (Wat's she tryin' to say?)

Destiny: (I think she's complimenting you?)

Season: "Why do you believe Lance has two of these containers?"

----------

*The party moaned at the same time and leant forward, holding their heads.*

Tyler: "Did anyone else just see that?" *He mumbled in disorientation, looking down to the grass.* "I.. I saw things I never witnessed myself."

Cameron: "That reminded me." *He grunted.* "I thought PKMY was a Scoldrant User because I saw Soul Links escaping her-"

Ridley: "Nothing can defeat me now! My powers rival even the master of Astragons! Madora herself!" *He swayed his hand, causing a swirl of aurora coloured light to explode the ground around him.*

Teresa: "We have failed."

Lezard: "Oh goodness, don't say that."

Cameron: "The Consultant's power-" *He stared at Ridley, causing the purple ring around his iris to spiral.* "It is immeasurable."

Season: (It's true. I've never seen anything this strong before. It's even stronger than mother's-)

PKMY: "Lance, he can-" *She grunted in pain, trying to grab the party's attention.* "He can withstand this pain and use the power-"

Lance: "Wait, wat?"

Holland: "PKMY thinks you can somehow use the power without taking damage." *He watched PKMY nod her head for confirmation.*

Tyler: *He clicked his fingers.* "That flashback of the whole double capacity thing."

Season: "Perhaps."

Holland: "It's like her empathic powers have created links between us all, that explains those flashbacks, her strange state, the ability to heal-"

Teresa: *She glanced between PKMY and Ridley as if she didn't know who to focus her attention on.* "Her Neuronic signatures are flowing in an inverse manner and her Astral readings are not circulating."

Lance: "Aye?"

Season: "It's like she's trying to contain a fire that's burning all the wood."

Tyler: "Once it's extinguished-"

Lance: "Then give it to me."

Teresa: "Hmm? But, if you can withstand its power, the damaging effects should still take its toll on you."

Lance: "Huh?"

Season: "You will lose your ability to use Rostical."

Lance: *He paused with widening eyes, causing all sounds to become mute.* (My powers? My Rostickal? Everythin' I've done, was to get stronger... To just sacrifice it..)

Tyler: "I thought the analogy of the w-wood and the fire was-"

Ridley: *He focused his attention on the party.* "Now that I've grown used to these new powers..." *He mumbled to himself, smirking in a confident manner.*

Tyler: "G-Guys, I think he's finished."

Ridley: "I can kill them all with a stroke of the arm." *He sarcastically waved his hand over to the party for his own amusement.*

Lezard: "H-He's coming." *He spoke with sarcasm, trying to cover up his exhaustion.*

Lance: *He looked at PKMY and slowly tilted his head to the side, staring at Ridley.* (Ash.. I'd ask what you would do, but-)

Tyler: "Ah?" *He watched Ridley slowly approach the party, causing fear to consume his face.*

Lance: (It's so damn obvious.) *He smirked, looking up in determination.* "Do it."

PKMY: "He can do it? He can."

Holland: "Amy, he will do it."

PKMY: *She opened her eyes and reached up to Lance.* "Take-" *She gargled blood.*

Lance: *He reached down, trying to hear what she was saying.* "Wat do I do-?"

PKMY: "Ah!" *She grabbed his arms and golden strings materialised around her body.*

Holland: (Soul Links?)

*Golden strings shot out from PKMY and into each party member.*

Season: "What?" *He looked down in disbelief.*

Tyler: "W-What is this excitement? This feeling?"

Season: *He glanced at Tyler.* "Neurons."

Tyler: *He gasped to himself.* "Is this what it feels like to have Rostical?!"

Ridley: *He noticed the golden strings, causing him to smirk.* (I have to admire their attempt to defeat me so.)

Lance: "A-A-" *The golden strings suddenly shot into his chest, causing him to drop to his knees.* "Garh!"

Teresa: (I can feel everyone's heartbeat!-)

Cameron: (I can feel what everyone is feeling.)

Apollo: (Me too!)

Lezard: (Jinkies, who was that?)

Apollo: (He heard me?!)

Tyler: (I can hear their-) *He gasped.* (Your thoughts-)

Lance: *His hair suddenly grew and stopped at his shoulders.* "Ah-" *His nails turned black and his eyes shined a fluoro purple.* "A-Ah."

*The entire party besides Lance fell unconscious, which startled Ridley.*

Lance: *A swirl of wind blew his hair to the side, dying each strand into a violet colour.* "Kerh.."

Ridley: "Don't you dare tell me, you all decided to finish it yourselves?!"

Lance: *He slowly stood up, causing his bones to crack.* "Gah-"

Ridley: "What is wrong with your hair? Why is it an amethyst-like colour?"

Lance: *He faced Ridley and smirked, revealing Freya's canine-like teeth.* "Nothin' wrong with it." *He mumbled with anger and excitement.*

Ridley: "Your eyes, are glowing. It's violet? Purple? What's with the sudden colour changes?"

Lance: "You will die now." *He stepped forward, causing the ground to crack.*

Ridley: *He looked at Lance's foot in shock.* (I can't sense his Neurons?) *He smirked with uncertainty.*

Lance: "All the people you've killed-"

Ridley: "Oh well, I'm not going to be lectured by someone a mere fraction of my lifetime-" *Swirls of aurora spiralled around him.*

Lance: "Their will is passed on to me."

Ridley: "Ah huh?"

----------

Sofia: "V-Valkyrie? Don't try and be funny! Pepper-"

Valkyrie: *She took a step closer, causing Sofia to raise the whip.* "Power of Radiagenicons, strongest healing revitalise my brethren, PHOENIX TRANQUILLITY, HEALING RINGS. SOOTHING LIGHT"

Sofia: (Pepper didn't- doesn't know healing-)

*A ray of pink light and a beam of white light fell from the sky, crashing on top of the party.*

Sofia: *She watched glowing white rings spiral around the party.* (She used three healing Rostical almost simultaneously-)

Valkyrie: "They will be fully restored in a matter of moments." *She stared at Sofia with an emotionless face.*

Sofia: "Ah!" *She screamed in fear and flicked her hand towards Pepper, causing the whip to spiral towards her.* "Sticky Smash."

Valkyrie: "Trivial, absolutely trivial." *She spoke in a condescending manner.*

Sofia: *The whip suddenly wrapped itself around Pepper's arm as if it had a mind of its own.* "Gotcha!"

Valkyrie: "It would seem so."

Sofia: "Hah!" *She pulled her arm forward, violently ripping Pepper's arm off.*

Valkyrie: "Hmm?" *She looked down without any emotion.*

Sofia: (Why didn't she scream in pain!? I just ripped off her arm!) *She flicked the whip back, causing it to let go of Pepper's arm.*

Valkyrie: "Heh." *She chuckled while keeping her emotionless face.* "Your techniques are so slovenly."

Sofia: "Ah!" *She spun around and sliced the whip across Pepper's face at amazing speeds.*

Valkyrie: *She looked to the side where the whip hit her.* "..."

Sofia: "..." *She spun around keeping the momentum and flicked her arm up in an uppercut-like motion.* "Whip Smack, Crescent Snap."

*A loud slapping sound echoed from Pepper's face, as the whip whacked her under the chin.*

Sofia: "Hahe-"

Valkyrie: *She took another step forward unaffected by Sofia's attacks.* "Thy say, is that all?" *Her voice was deep and stern, causing Sofia to unintentionally lower her head.*

Sofia: "Grrr." *She stepped back and grabbed the whip's handle with both hands.* "Carasmic Swirl." *She slashed the air in front of her and a swirl of light which moved like a whip spiralled towards Pepper.*

Valkyrie: *She watched the whip made of light spiral into striking distance.* (A Radiagenicon-filled Azure Burst-)

*The whip-like light suddenly pierced Pepper through the chest, causing Sofia to laugh in astonishment.*

Sofia: "Hahehahe." *She snapped the whip back to her side and watched Pepper step forward holding her wound.* "Guess your little transformation was just for show!"

Valkyrie: "..."

Sofia: "Let's try it again, but this time, it will be your head! Carasmic Swirl." *She held the whip's handle with both hands and tightened her grip.*

Valkyrie: "The actions thou've done. If thou stop now, thy will kill thou swiftly-"

Sofia: "Haheheha." *She flicked the whip in front, causing a swirl of light to spiral towards Pepper.*

Valkyrie: "So be it-" *She raised her hand revealing golden streams of blood running out of her chest.* "Thy will no longer offer thou the luxury of a swift death."

Sofia: "Done!" *She smirked and flicked the whip of light towards Pepper's head, listening to it snap through the air.*

Valkyrie: *She caught the light in her hand, causing it to violently screech.* "Thou are powerful, but your power is equivalent to an insect when compared to mine." *She formed a fist, disintegrating the light prematurely.*

Sofia: "Arh?" *She stepped back and stopped, bumping into a tree behind her.* (Her power momentarily rose above mine, but now I can't sense it? Something just feels, off-)

Valkyrie: "It will be my turn to strike-"

Sofia: (No! It's just nerves-) *She shook her head and jumped forward towards Pepper.* "Yee harh! Sticky Smash."

*The whip moved on its own accord and wrapped itself around Pepper's remaining arm.*

Sofia: "Now you'll be armless! Haheahe-"

Valkyrie: *She grabbed the whip with her hand and tightened her grip, causing it to spark.* "Hoh?"

Sofia: "What is making my whip spark?"

Valkyrie: "My power."

Sofia: *Her black and gold eyes flickered, as the sparks travelled up the whip.* "Wharh-?" *She let go of the whip, as it combusted and exploded into tiny pieces.* "Im-"

Valkyrie: "-Possible?" *She looked at her missing arm and nudged her head, causing another arm to instantly erupt out of her wound.* "That is better-" *Her arm was slimy as she formed a fist.*

Sofia: (She just regenerate an entire arm!-)

Valkyrie: "Quick internal light, INVOKING AURA" *A swirl of light flashed around her chest, healing her wounds.*

Sofia: (She healed herself?) "H-How did you do that?!"

Valkyrie: "Hmm? My new arm looks naked, does it not?" *She raised her arm, as golden bangles materialised around her wrist and blue glyphs drew themselves around her fingers and arm.*

Sofia: "We can't heal ourselves!"

Valkyrie: *She straightened her arm and a clear crystal-like sword materialised in her hand.* "Hmm.." *She held the sword by a silver handle which reflected the surrounding objects.*

Sofia: *Her eyes widened in shock and she looked nervous, looking at her hands in realisation.* (My whip!)

Valkyrie: "What will thou do now, Sofia Ripples?"

Sofia: "Grarh!"

Valkyrie: "FLAME BOLT" *She casually and elegantly nudged her hand forward, shooting ten balls of bright red flames at Sofia.*

Sofia: (Rostical!-) "Neurons draw, Astragons to my command, Radiatons move to my will, four corners meet and combine, MOONLIGHT REFLECTION"

*An oval-shaped ripple swirled in front of Sofia, causing all ten fireballs to pause in mid-air.*

Valkyrie: "Moonlight Reflection.. Even a divine Remenistal is dirtied by your slovenly words-"

Sofia: "Grarh!" *She screamed and swayed forward, blasting the balls back at Pepper.*

Valkyrie: "MYSTIC SHIELD-" *She lowered her arm and watched a golden shield instantaneously spiral around her, blocking the balls of fire.*

Sofia: "Haheahe! Like a taste of your own-?!"

Valkyrie: "-STRIKE" *She watched the shield burst, blasting the balls of fire back into different directions around Sofia.*

Sofia: *Massive bursts of bright red flames exploded, flapping her ponytail to each side.* "How-?!"

Valkyrie: "Humph." *She watched the shield's shattering glass-like aura form into balls, suddenly blasting towards Sofia.*

Sofia: *She gasped with widening eyes, quickly flipping over the glass-like balls.* (A triple combo?!) *She landed and screamed in thought, listening to the glass shatter behind her.*

Valkyrie: "Thy can feel the confusion.."

Sofia: "Shut up!"

Valkyrie: "By purposely releasing the shield prematurely, it created a pulse of Astragenicons and which done at the correct corresponding time, bounced back the Remenistal."

Sofia: *She shook her head in frustration, ignoring branches of burning leaves which fell to the ground.* "You've somehow cheated the game!"

Valkyrie: "Do thou now understand what thy have said to thou from the start-?"

Sofia: *She screamed at Pepper in frustration and looked up into the sky past the swirling swarm of Darkwings.* (Then I'll fight to my advantage-) *Black and white radiant wings erupted from her back, catching Pepper's attention.*

Valkyrie: "Oh?"

Sofia: "Hahehahe, you may have been better back then, Pepper." *She grunted in anger and a wave of smoke puffed around her eyes, solidifying into a black visor.*

Valkyrie: "Better?"

Sofia: "But I've been practising my flying techniques for years!" *She suddenly blasted into the air, causing swirls of dirt to scatter where she stood.*

Valkyrie: "Thy see-" *She pointed the sword into the air, aiming it for Sofia.* "Ougi, Radiant Lancer." *Her sword shattered into pieces and she flicked her wrist, causing a sword made of aura to shoot out from the handle.*

Sofia: *Her ponytail flapped in the air behind her.* (I'll use the Darkwings as fodder, then I'll hide in the clouds and use my Ougi-) *She smirked in a worried manner.*

Valkyrie: "Hermph!" *She lunged the sword upwards and the aura extended, violently piercing through the air.*

Sofia: "Darkwings-" *A sword of light stabbed her through the shoulder, causing her to gasp in fright.*

Valkyrie: "Thy have become weak-" *She spread her arms, as six blue radiant wings erupted from her back.* "Hermph."

*Pepper flicked her arm to the side and sparks scattered from a re-materialising crystal sword.*

Sofia: *She held her shoulder in pain as the light disintegrated.* (What kind of Azure or Rostical was that?!)

Valkyrie: "..." *She blasted into the air and her image disappeared, giving the illusion she flashstepped.*

*The ground cracked and exploded, due to the force of Pepper's jump.*

Sofia: *She heard an explosion from the mountain, causing her to look back.* (A dirt cloud?)

Valkyrie: "Indeed."

Sofia: *She gasped and looked in front.* "How-?"

Valkyrie: *She lowered the sword to her side and pointed her hand at Sofia.* "The divine art bright as the holy sun number eighty nine, CRIMSON BEAM" *A fluoro red pulse splashed around her hand and a straight beam blasted towards Sofia at incredible speeds.*

Sofia: "Locki's!-" *She raised her hands, as the beam slammed into her arms.* "Arh-grarh!" *She frowned in pain, as she slowly floated back due to the force of the beam.*

Valkyrie: *She lowered her arm, causing the beam to disintegrate away.* "Air Slash." *She spun her body and sliced upwards, causing a visible air slash to screech towards Sofia.*

Sofia: *She stared at the burns on her arms which visibly and slowly healed.* "You-" *She looked up and quickly raised her hand, blocking the air slash.*

Valkyrie: *She watched the clouds behind Sofia cut in two.* "..."

Sofia: *She frowned in anger and her eyes shined, allowing her to throw away the air slash.* (Sharp-) *Blood stringed down her hand.*

Valkyrie: *She watched the air slash smash into the mountain, causing a massive explosion to rise.* (Her hand was meant to be cleanly sliced off-)

Sofia: "Darkwings, get her!" *She screamed at the top of her lungs, causing a swarm of Darkwings to dive towards Pepper.*

Valkyrie: *She casually looked to the side with her beautiful golden eyes.* "Raining Fury." *She raised the sword against her cheek and jabbed the sword like a missile, bursting a Darkwing into swirling pieces.*

Sofia: "There're heaps, haheahe-" *She licked the deep cut on her hand, smirking at Pepper.*

Valkyrie: "Thy see." *She faced the Darkwings and spread her legs, as if she stood on the ground.*

Sofia: (Pepper's eyes changed colour.. I didn't even notice.)

Valkyrie: "Sacred blood throughout my veins, thy say heed thout command, SOUTHERN CROSS" *The glyphic cross formed circles and a bright light emanated from the glyph, which made unusual sounds.*

Sofia: *She noticed Pepper focusing her attention to the Darkwings that dived into striking distance.* "Grarharheharh." *She spun around and blasted towards a set of multi-layered clouds.*

Valkyrie: "My power is different-" *She raised her arms, causing the glyph to separate and levitate above her, creating a 3D-like glyph.* "Herh!" *She tapped her foot, causing a blinding light to shatter the nearby Darkwings.*

Sofia: *She flew through puffy clouds and slowed her flying speed.* (My shoulder-) *She placed her hand on her shoulder and looked at the blood on her hand.* (It's healed, but it's still stinging-)

Valkyrie: *She noticed another swarm of Darkwings dive towards her.* (Sofia was correct, there are many-) "Ougi, Angelic Celestic Siren." *She hummed on a soft-high note and a pulse of silver wind blew from her mouth.*

Darkwing: "Skree-" *Its eyes glowed silver, causing it to suddenly stop.*

Valkyrie: *She watched the swarm fall under her control.* "Destroy the others-" *Her words caused the swarm to screech and turn around towards the other Darkwings.*

*Several Darkwings violently dived into each other and others shot skeletal arrows in the air.*

Valkyrie: *She turned around and faced the direction where Sofia once stood.* (She must have finally understood my power and has fled?)

Sofia: *She panted and reached to her sides.* (My beloved whip-) *Sparks scattered from her sides and she held a whip in each hand.* (These are weaker, a Black Brigade variant.)

Valkyrie: *She glided through the air, causing her robes and hair to gently flap on her sides.* (She's masking her power.) *She thought with an emotionless face, scanning the sky for Sofia.*

Sofia: (I can feel her, she's still far away. I'll take the time to regenerate these burns and then strike using the clouds like I did with Celest-)

Valkyrie: *She glanced at a set of clouds in the distance and faced it.* "Cloud Cutter." *She flicked the sword, causing an invisible force to screech.*

Sofia: "What-" *She flew to the side, as the clouds sliced in half revealing her position.*

Valkyrie: "HOLY LANCE" *She watched a stroke of light fall from the sky and past Sofia.*

Sofia: *Blood strung from her arm, as a deep slash mark appeared on it.* (That Holy Lance was fast-)

Valkyrie: "HOLY LANCE" *Her wings moved like razor blades and she soared through the air towards Sofia.*

Sofia: "Ah-" *She spun around, barely avoiding the lance.* (This isn't possible!)

Valkyrie: "HOLY LANCE"

Sofia: "More-" *Her wings flared, allowing her to swirl in the air with unnatural movements.*

Valkyrie: "HOLY LANCE, HOLY LANCE, HOLY LANCE, HOLY LANCE, HOLY LANCE, HOLY LANCE" *She flew into striking distance, causing her to raise the sword.*

Sofia: *She danced along the air, avoiding each devastating lance.* "Grah-" *A cut formed downwards on her cheek and another on her foot, causing sparks to scatter off her armour.* (The sheer force, the Rasticsplash of the lances are slicing the air on to my body-)

Valkyrie: "Slithering Slicer." *She vibrated her wrist, causing the sword to slither like a snake.*

Sofia: *She looked up and smirked with exhaustion.* (That's all the lances-)

Valkyrie: *She flashstepped face to face to Sofia and slashed the sword across her body.* "Hermph-"

Sofia: "Bwgarh!" *She spiralled in the air, due to Pepper's slash.* "Keh-" *Her wings flared, causing her to stop in mid-air.*

Valkyrie: "Hermph." *She glided towards Sofia with the sword raised.*

Sofia: "Ah!" *She grunted in anger and flashstepped behind Pepper.*

Valkyrie: "Ougi, come to my aid and fight alongside me, Ice Dragoon."

Sofia: "H-Harh?" *Boulders of ice materialised and exploded in the air, shattering into dragon-like sculptures.*

Valkyrie: "Kill her." *She spoke calmly, staring at the clouds in front of her.*

Sofia: (She isn't even bothering to turn around to face me-) *The dragons roared, causing mist to escape their mouths.* "Tssk-" *She spun around and blasted high into the air.*

Valkyrie: *She slowly spiralled around and watched four ice dragons fly after Sofia.* (Thy am curious, to what drove this woman of the light-) *She watched Sofia shatter two dragons by twirling her whips like a tornado.*

Sofia: "Yee harh!" *She crossed her arms, placing them on her chest.*

Valkyrie: (To this-)

Sofia: *She tightened her arms and kicked her legs, suddenly spinning herself around.* "Hah!" *She extended her arms and sliced downwards, shattering the other two ice sculptures.*

Valkyrie: *She disintegrated into strings of white light and materialised under Sofia.* "Thou exceeded my expectations to defeat the ice sculptures."

Sofia: "Gah." *She looked down in shock and frowned.* "Roaring Beast Kick." *She leant forward and dived down at Pepper.*

Valkyrie: *She threw the sword in the air to her side.* (Perhaps thy'm seeing this all wrong. There are some spirits that are just naturally bad, life's outliers-)

Sofia: "Hahehahe!" *She dived into striking distance, causing her to raise her leg.*

Valkyrie: "Infinity Fury of Kicks." *She stood on one leg and kicked the other across Sofia.*

*A loud thump could be heard, as Pepper and Sofia's legs connected.*

Sofia: *She grunted, trying to kick Pepper's leg away.* "Get, off!-"

Valkyrie: *She motioned her arms under Sofia and slowly raised them in a fluid manner.* "Power of the deep depths, let our power roar like thunder, and shatter like ice, heed our words, ETHEREAL RAPIDS"

Sofia: "H-Huh-" *Rumbling could be heard, causing her to look down.* "W-Wha-?!" *A river-sized gush of fluoro white water erupted up, taking her with it.*

*Rainbows shined from the sprinkles of water which sprayed into the air, as the violent current enveloped Sofia.*

Valkyrie: *She swayed her arm towards the water and moved her fingers, causing it to swirl to her command.* "Child's play-"

Sofia: "Skrah!" *She screamed which caused the water to suddenly burst in a pulse away from her.*

Valkyrie: *She lowered her hand and elegantly flicked her hair over her shoulder.* "LIGHTNING STORM" *Clouds spiralled and instantly formed above Sofia.*

Sofia: (That won't be enough to-) *Water dripped from her hair in front of her eyes, causing her to gasp.* "No-" *Lightning which fell like rain flashed around her.* "Argh!" *Her body violently twitched from side to side.*

Valkyrie: *She soared through the air towards Sofia.* (This game of chase is tiring-)

Sofia: *Her band which held her ponytail together lit on fire.* "Shrarh-" *The lightning faded, causing her to bend over in agony.* "H-Have I met my match?"

Valkyrie: "Perhaps." *She spoke with an emotionless face, hovering at a close distance to Sofia.*

Sofia: "Fine, I'll use Rostical." *She coughed in anger.*

Valkyrie: "Oh really? How cute. SILENCING FORCE" *She opened and closed her hands at Sofia.*

Sofia: "How cute? You're going to get a game over now!-" *She stopped in mid-sentence and looked shocked, touching her throat.* (I can't talk?!)

Valkyrie: *She raised her arm and the crystal clear sword materialised back into her hand.* "Herh." *She dived towards Sofia, pointing the sword forward.*

Sofia: (She's diving at a speed where I can react and attack accordingly-) *She spiralled in the air and over Pepper.* (Harh.) *She flicked her arm behind her, causing the whip to wrap itself around Pepper's sword.*

Valkyrie: (Thy continue to underestimate her-) *She swiftly spun around and faced Sofia, ignoring her hair and robes that flapped around her.*

Sofia: (Grarh-) *She stared at Pepper and flicked her other hand, swirling the other whip above her.*

Valkyrie: "Thou're skilful at wielding two whips."

Sofia: (Harh.) *She frowned in response, slicing the whip downwards towards Pepper's head.*

Valkyrie: *She tilted the sword's angle, causing it to slice the whip to pieces.* "Hermph-" *She flashstepped as the whip sliced the air where she stood.*

Sofia: *She looked at the sliced whip in frustration and threw it away, causing it to fall through the sky.* (Grr-)

Valkyrie: "Enough evasive abilities, thy am ready to end this battle."

Sofia: *She slapped the air with her whip, causing it to make a crack-like sound.* (Sound?) "I-It's finished." *She coughed to clear her throat.*

Valkyrie: "It was preferable when thou did not speak-"

Sofia: "Ougi-"

Valkyrie: "That whip will not endure the Ougi you used on me before-"

Sofia: "Darkness of wicked blood, light of pure heart, combine your forces and show 'em what I can do! Holy Red Eruption." *A swirl of blood-like liquid swirled in her left hand, as a pulse of light-like liquid spiralled in her right hand.*

Valkyrie: (She has two Ougis?)

Sofia: *She ran on the air towards Pepper with her fists raised.* "Harh!"

Valkyrie: "Ougi, Celestrial Lancer."

Sofia: "Wha-?"

*Five swirls of fire burnt themselves into the shape of a sword, causing the air to warp around them.*

Valkyrie: *The swords solidified and pointed towards Sofia.* "Hermph-" *She clapped her hands and the swords shot at blinding speeds, stabbing into Sofia's waist.*

Sofia: "Arh!" *She screamed in pain, as the clothes burnt around the swords.* (Get her!)

*Several Darkwings escaped the ones controlled by Pepper and they swarmed towards her.*

Sofia: *She smirked, as blood ran out of her nose.* "They'll get you!"

Valkyrie: "Perhaps." *She straightened her hand behind her.* "Shattering bonds, my Radiagenicons explode and implode the power of light, SERENITY SWIRL" *She opened her hand and several twirls of light blasted through the air towards the Darkwings.*

Sofia: (She's just staring at me with those condescending eyes!-) "These are hot!-" *She punched the swords, trying to break free.*

Valkyrie: "Hot? DIAMOND'S EDGE" *Sounds of scraping glass echoed in the wind.*

Sofia: (Diamond's Edge? I remember Lorilei using that-) *She looked down and braced herself.*

Valkyrie: *She raised the sword and held it with both hands.* "Hermph-" *She sliced horizontally and a slash of ice erupted, covering Sofia.*

Sofia: *The fire swords instantly extinguished due to the ice's pressure.* (Ice is only good to pierce the body-)

*The slash-like line of ice grew and expanded, as continuous chunks of ice exploded on top of each other.*

Sofia: (It hurts!-) *Veins showed themselves on her skin, as the freezing ice started to burn her body.*

Valkyrie: *She clicked her fingers, causing the small mountain of ice to shatter.* (Now to finish her-) *Glitters of light shined in her face, as the ice spiralled towards the ground.*

Sofia: *She slowly descended in a motionless manner, watching ice crack off her arms.* (I've never encountered a power like hers before!)

Valkyrie: (Where?) *She lost track of Sofia due to the glittering light.*

Sofia: (I can't move! Move!) *Her arms, legs and wings twitched.*

Valkyrie: *She scanned the area and noticed the shine of Sofia's radiant wings.* "There." *She placed her hand behind her back.*

Sofia: *She coughed and looked worried.* (She's stronger than me! I have to get out of here! Ridley, my love, I won't fail you-)

Valkyrie: "ARCADIC PULSARE" *She reached out and a gust of white aura took form of a hand.*

Sofia: "Gah-" (I have to retreat! How immensely, completely and utterly pathetic of me!) *Her black and white wings flared and moved like razor blades.*

*Sofia raised her arms and wiped the blood from her nose before adjusting the black visor around her eyes.*

Sofia: (Full speed-) *She shot through the air away from Pepper.*

Valkyrie: *The hand-like aura swirled and twirled through the air towards Sofia.* (My power is limitless, thy feel no signs of fatigue-)

Sofia: *She showed her gritted teeth, as she breathed through her mouth in desperation.* (I've forgotten where the Spacial Funnel is-) *She swayed to each side avoiding puffs of cloud.* (-To get out of here!)

Valkyrie: *She motioned her arm with the aura, increasing its speed.* "Hermph-"

Sofia: *Her hair elegantly, yet, violently flapped behind her.* "Arh!" (I just remembered where the Spacial Funnel is!-)

Valkyrie: *She opened her hand and quickly closed it, causing the aura to grab on to Sofia's ankle.* (Now your demise is inevitable.)

Sofia: *Her eyes instantly widened in shock, causing her to look at her ankle.* "Grah!"

Valkyrie: (Now thou're in the grasp of judgement.) *Her voice echoed in Sofia's mind with an intimidating tone.*

Sofia: (Get this aura off of me!) *She formed a fist.* "Bloody Erup-" *A lance of white light shot down from the sky, piercing her through the chest.* "Karh-"

Valkyrie: *She leant back and enthusiastically swayed her arms.* "Since thou use whips, perhaps thou may appreciate this-" *She flew in a large circle and quickly spiralled her body, causing loops of the aura to travel towards Sofia.*

Sofia: "What is she doing-?" *The loop spiralled up and violently flicked her upside down.* "What!?" *Another loop threw her across the sky and whipped her towards the mountain.*

Valkyrie: *She watched Sofia being flung into the mountain, causing a massive explosion of dirt and vegetation to rise.* (On the other side of the mountain, away from my Sacred Knights.)

*Pepper shook her wrist, causing the string of aura to disintegrate into nothing.*

Valkyrie: (The only cure for the pain that your existence creates is death. Your purification will end in solitude, which will complement the doleful expression on your face.)

Sofia: *She moaned and dragged herself off several sharp rocks.* "W-Wh-" *She coughed out dirt and looked around.* (She used the aura to swing me into the mountain, like a whip.)

*Sofia attempted to push herself up and collapsed onto the dirt.*

Sofia: (I can't-) *She spat out blood.* (Not yet.)

Valkyrie: "Majestic light, motion forth and put forward what is inevitable, the ancient twilight power of the radiant beings grant me all your strength-"

*Unreadable symbols and hieroglyphs materialised in the air, causing light to shimmer off Pepper's armour.*

Valkyrie: "All spirits bow down to this almighty power, thy say tremble and wither down before my knees-" *A massive white glyph spiralled in the air behind Pepper.*

*The glyph made chime-like sounds and expanded, causing several rings to form and rotate around it.*

Valkyrie: "To fight me such is your reward, SACRED SWARM" *She swayed her arms back and threw them in front towards the mountain, causing the glyph to shine.* "Hermph-"

*Thick blinding streams of light erupted out from the glyph and past Pepper, leaving trails of glittering dust-like light behind them.*

Sofia: *Missile-like screeches could be heard in the distance.* (What are those noises-?) *Twinkles of light could be seen through the dirt cloud.*

Valkyrie: *Her hair and robes flapped forward, as continuous streams of light erupted past her towards the mountain.* (It was hard not using these high levelled techniques right away-)

*Explosions of light caused the mountain to rumble, causing Pepper to look serious.*

Valkyrie: (Otherwise this vessel would have died instantaneously.) *She watched chunks of boulders roll off the mountain, tumbling through the sky.* (It was a necessity to wait until the fusion of Radiagenicons was complete.)

*Streams of light continued to explode into the ground, bursting large rocks into the air.*

Sofia: *She spiralled and flopped through the air as waves of light exploded on all sides.* (What's that?) *She looked in front and watched an arm sway past her face and into the distance.* (That's mine?)

Valkyrie: *The glyphs and light around her disintegrated into the air, causing her to lower her arms.* (Thy am pleased to see the entire mountain did not shatter to that Remenistal.) *She smirked, watching the dirt settle around the mountain.*

Sofia: *She lay on the rubble and looked at her arm, noticing it was missing.* (It was!)

Valkyrie: *She stood on the air with an emotionless face.* (Despite her wicked intent, it still saddens me when a life begins to fade away.)

Sofia: (Regenerate-) *She focused on her missing arm and nothing happened, cueing her to look surprised.* (My power has dwindled to this? Perhaps I can take advantage and hide in the dirt cloud-?)

Valkyrie: "Power of the forbidden spirits, come to my command, with seraphic powers, TELEPORTATION" *She disappeared in a flash of purple light.*

Sofia: *Her wings distorted and flashed, bursting into nothing.* (Her Neurons-, she's very far away, all I need to do is crawl in the rubble and maybe she'll think I'm dead-)

Valkyrie: *A purple glyph flashed on the ground next to Sofia.* "Hmm?" *She stepped off the glyph and looked down to Sofia with condescending eyes.*

Sofia: "Teleportation? How?"

Valkyrie: "Thou dare insult me?"

Sofia: "B-But my love sealed all tele-?"

Valkyrie: "Thou think a mere seal could stop me from using my power?"

Sofia: "I'll just have to raise the difficulty again to defeat-"

Valkyrie: *She spread her legs, causing her hair and robes to flap around her.* "Thy will now use the strongest Remenistal-" *She breathed heavily and started to concentrate.*

----------

Lance: *He looked at Ridley with a twitching eye and formed fists, ignoring his long purple hair which flapped around his shoulders.* "You have no idea wat is gonna happen, do ya?"

Ridley: "To be quite honest, with these aurora powers, I'm not fussed with whatever power-up you have received."

Lance: "Heh-" *His long hair waved in the wind, as he stared at Ridley with anticipation.*

Ridley: "Well then-" *He smirked and flicked his hands, causing the ground to explode around Lance.* "That was easy-"

Lance: "I rekon." *He grunted, as he stared at Ridley's back.*

Ridley: "Oh my-?!" *He quickly spun around.*

Lance: *He bounced forward and jumped up.* "Hah!" *He kicked the air and an invisible force pushed Ridley along the ground.*

Ridley: "Ha!" *He slid back and waved his hand, causing a stroke of aurora to slice past Lance.*

Lance: "Tssk." *He watched the aurora light sway behind his shoulder, noticing a string of blood run down his arm.*

Ridley: *A swirl of aurora spiralled around his feet, causing him to instantly stop.* "..."

Lance: *He smirked at Ridley and landed on the ground, watching water spiral around his arm.* (Water-?)

Ridley: (I don't understand.. I know for a fact Lance can only use lightning.)

Lance: *He watched the water pulse away, leaving his shoulder completely healed.* "Heh."

Ridley: (The water healed his wounds?) "Oh well-"

Lance: *He raised his arm and green lightning sparked in between his fingers, taking shape of a sword.* "Come on, coco butts." *He bent at the knees and flashstepped several feet face to face to Ridley.*

Ridley: *He watched the ground explode where Lance stood, causing him to lean back.* "Hmph."

Lance: "Harh!" *He sliced the sword across Ridley's face.*

Ridley: *He ducked, avoiding the slice.* "Too slow-"

Lance: *He suddenly kicked Ridley in the face, knocking him back.* "I dunno why I never thought of this, hey." *He raised his other arm and red lightning sparked, taking form of a sword.*

Ridley: *He wiped his mouth and stood up, looking at the green and red lightning.* (Duel wielding?)

Lance: *He ran forward at incredible speeds and slash upwards and across.* "Air Slash."

Ridley: *He swayed to each side, avoiding the air slashes.* "Pathetic-" *He coughed in shock, as the air slashes cut into his back.* (How-?! He manipulated them?!)

Lance: *He flashstepped face to face to Ridley and crossed the lightning, slicing in front.* "Heh." *He smirked, as lightning splintered past his face.* "Wow."

Ridley: *Lightning sparked up his arm.* "Blast- ouch" *He stumbled back, coughing in shock.*

Lance: "You should be more careful when handlin' lightning, someone more experienced with the element taught me that."

Ridley: "Careful?"

Lance: "Blockin' it with your hands is a safety hazard."

Ridley: *His eye twitched in anger.* "Don't lecture me, boy."

Lance: "FLAMING WHEEL" *He clicked his fingers, causing an eruption of flames to spiral around Ridley.*

Ridley: *He frowned and stamped his foot, causing a pulse of shadow to extinguish the flames.* "Lance-"

Lance: "Yea?" *He appeared behind Ridley, jabbing the swords towards the back of his head.*

Ridley: *He spun around in shock and raised his arms, watching two black swords puff into his hands.* "ROTTING SWORD" *He blocked Lance's jabs, watching lightning travel up his arms.* "Argh."

Lance: "Aha, usin' two swords? That's pretty tough-" *He smirked and leant forward, forcing Ridley back.*

Ridley: "Hmm-"

Lance: *He jumped forward, slashing and slicing the air in front of Ridley.* "Heh."

Ridley: *He continuously stepped back avoiding Lance's strikes.* (When did he obtain this swordsmanship-?) *He triggered a flashback of observing Cameron's fighting style.* (Cameron?!)

Lance: *He spun in an acrobatic manner, kicking directly onto Ridley's sword, blasting him back.* "Ha."

Ridley: *He slid back and frowned, swaying the black sword to the side.* "Regardless, I will defeat-"

Lance: "LIGHTNING CHAIN BLAST" *He pushed forward, blasting five fluoro yellow streams of lightning at Ridley.*

Ridley: *He watched the lightning curve into striking distance, causing him to slash them away.* (They are following my Neuron signature?!) *He shouted in thought, watching the streams of lightning swirl back towards him.*

Lance: *He flashstepped behind Ridley, slicing across.* (Aha.)

Ridley: *He quickly moved the black swords at blinding speeds, hitting all five streams of lightning back.* "Tssk." *He quickly ducked under Lance's strike and jumped up, avoiding two streams of yellow lightning behind him.*

Lance: *He looked up and smirked, filled with confidence.* "Heh."

Ridley: *He landed on the ground and leant back, readying himself.* (I'm amazed these streams of lightning haven't broken after being hit a few times-)

Lance: *He suddenly appeared directly next to Ridley, kneeing him in the ribs.* "Heh." *He swayed to the side, allowing three streams of lightning to spark into Ridley's shoulder.*

Ridley: "Argh-" *He shouted, causing a pulse of shadow to suddenly disintegrate the lightning away.*

Lance: "Whoa, settle down, man." *He jumped towards Ridley, slicing the lightning sword downwards.*

Ridley: *He ignored his burns and raised his sword, blocking Lance's strike.* "Tssk-"

Lance: "Yahoo." *He pushed forward, blasting Ridley across the ground.*

Ridley: *He tumbled back and hit the ground, quickly sliding onto his feet.* "How-?"

Lance: *He flashstepped under Ridley, sweeping him off his feet.* "Heh-" *He jumped on his hands, kicking Ridley up into the air.*

Ridley: "Why you!-" *He looked down, throwing a black sword directly onto Lance, causing the ground to burst around him.*

Lance: *He flashstepped in the air next to Ridley, jabbing the lightning towards his face.* "Hah!"

Ridley: *He quickly slashed the lightning away, causing electricity to spark up his black sword.* (Blast the Astragons-)

Lance: *He flashstepped above Ridley and raised his arms, clapping them downwards.* "THUNDER BOOM"

Ridley: *He looked up in shock, before suddenly being shot into the ground.* "Kah-" *He coughed in shock, listening to echoing thunder rumble through the air.*

Lance: *He flashstepped above Ridley, hovering in the air.* "Emperor's Fury." *He watched aura swirl around his fist, causing him to punch it directly into Ridley's back.*

*Lance smirked, watching Ridley's body puff into smoke, causing his fist to touch the ground.*

Ridley: *He appeared in a puff of smoke in the distance, causing him to frown at Lance.* (I have this immense power, so why am I being-?)

*Ridley shouted in thought, causing aurora coloured lights to swirl in his hands, taking shape of swords.*

Ridley: "Excellent, now-" *He took a step forward, watching Lance's image appear directly in front of his face.*

Lance: "Tcch." *He jabbed the lightning directly towards Ridley's forehead, causing him to smirk in a victorious manner.*

Ridley: *He quickly crossed his aurora swords in front of his face, causing Lance's lightning to suddenly repel back.* (Huh?)

Lance: *He stumbled back, as the ground exploded in the distance where he punched Ridley.* "Wha-?"

Ridley: *He grunted and nudged forward, pushing Lance back with a pulse of aurora.* "Haha!"

Lance: "Wat's funny?" *He smirked and watched from a bird's eye view, as his hair flapped in the wind.*

Ridley: *He looked up startled.* "I beg your pardon?" *He looked in front and noticed Lance sliding back.* (There's two!? Like Teresa!-)

Lance: "Oi-" *He shouted from the air, catching Ridley's attention.*

Ridley: *He stared at Lance in the air, who appeared to hover over him.* (Which one do I strike?)

Lance: *He smirked, staring at Ridley from the air.* "Ougi." *He spoke with a widening smile, placing one hand in front and the other over his shoulder.*

Ridley: (Ougi? A lightning-based Ougi must possess a powerful Rasticsplash-)

Lance: *He continued to slide back on the ground.* (I dunno why I'm able to move so easily, maybe he's just bein' slow?) *He bent at the knees, causing him to stop sliding.* "Forty five-" *He raised the two lightning swords next to his head.* "Streaming Sword."

Ridley: "Streaming Sword?" *He quickly looked back in front at Lance.*

Lance: "Wat 'bout me?" *White liquid materialised and swirled around his hands.* "Mastered state of Alchemy and Crafting I show you, Ragnarok." *The liquid formed a bazooka and he shot a green fluoro ball at Ridley.*

Ridley: *He jumped back and covered his face, as a green pulse exploded the ground high into the air.* (I was barely able to react in time-)

*A green and red stream of lightning blasted through the dirt cloud, towards Ridley.*

Ridley: *He gasped in shock and flashstepped to the side, avoiding the green stream of lightning.* "Tssk." *He hit the red stream of lightning with both his swords, repelling it back.*

Lance: *He flashstepped behind Ridley and threw away the bazooka, causing it to disintegrate into white liquid.* "'Sup?"

Ridley: *He slid across the ground causing his feet to wobble and he looked back in shock.* "Harh!" *He waved behind him and sliced Lance with his aurora sword.*

Lance: *He flashstepped back, avoiding Ridley's strike.* "Close, man."

Ridley: "Tssk-" *He spun around and raised the sword, facing Lance.*

Lance: "Hittin' an armless man? Weak as!" *He shouted at Ridley's back and dived out of the dirt cloud with the lightning swords raised.*

Ridley: "Gah-" *He looked over his shoulder, frowning at the Lance copy behind him.*

Lance: "Gah? Wat's that?" *He smirked at Ridley, watching him look behind him at his copy.*

Ridley: *He quickly looked back in front, glaring at the weaponless Lance.* "Be quiet."

Lance: "Wateva." *He glanced at the aurora swords, causing him to take several steps back.*

Ridley: "This ability, you have the same weakness as her-"

*Ridley slashed the air to his side, causing the Lance in front of him to choke and fade away.*

Ridley: "Hah, knew it-" *He smirked and turned back around, focusing his attention to the Lance with the lightning swords.*

Lance: "Aha jokes!" *He flashstepped in the air and pointed down to Ridley.* "Tangrowth Slash."

Ridley: *He focused on the Lance running towards him, causing shadow to swirl around his head.* "DARK-"

Lance: *He ran into striking distance and sliced the lightning sword downwards, ripping Ridley's clothes.* "Ha-"

Ridley: "Take this!" *He spun around and slashed Lance across the face, causing the lightning's swirl to stop.*

Lance: "Huh?" *He watched the lightning swords spark away in shock.*

Ridley: "Enough of you!" *He leant forward and jabbed the aurora swords into Lance's chest, watching his image fade away.*

Lance: "Not bad-" *Black vine-like nails shot down and stabbed Ridley on the top of his shoulders.*

Ridley: "Grah!" *He clapped his hands above his head, causing an aurora pulse to explode around Lance in the air.*

Lance: *The ground shattered as he flashstepped on all fours in the distance.* (He may not be quick, but his attacks require no startup time?) *He tilted his head at an angle, raising an eyebrow in confusion.* "That sounded smart-" *He mumbled and stood up.*

Ridley: *He flashstepped into striking distance and slashed the sword across, causing a visible aurora air slash to slice towards Lance.* "Think quick-"

Lance: "No worries-" *He straightened his arm at Ridley, ignoring the aurora slash.* "SOLAR FLARE"

Ridley: "Excuse-?" *His face lit up, as a white beam with blue fluoro shading blasted towards him.* "Grahh." *He crossed the swords and blocked the beam.*

Lance: *He raised his vacant hand and wobbled it around.* "Why limit myself?" *He mumbled and straightened his other arm towards Ridley.* "SOLAR FLARE"

Ridley: *He gritted his teeth and slowly stood his ground, as strong winds blew past him.* "What did he mumble?" *He gasped, as another beam slammed into him, causing him to slide back.* (Two?!)

Lance: *He smirked, as his hair blew back.* (Nice.) *He watched the two beams string and scatter at the end, as Ridley continued to hold his own.*

Ridley: (What am I going to do? I feel the density of these swords weakening-) *The beams started to pulse, causing him to smile.* (Why was I worrying? He must be growing tired, the beams are pulsing-)

Lance: "I realised, you never answered me when I said 'sup."

Ridley: *He looked behind him in shock, as he continued to slide back due to the beams.* (He flashstepped behind me while this Remenistal is still being executed?!) "This, I haven't seen-"

Lance: "Me neither." *He interrupted Ridley and looked at his purple hair, flicking it in disgust.* "I dunno 'bout you, but I don't like it."

Ridley: "What are you talking about?!"

Lance: "I guess a Hi-Ougi is up." *He looked away, shrugging his shoulders.*

Ridley: "You can't Hi-Ougi-"

Lance: "Hi-Ougi." *He smirked like a child as if he was about to prove Ridley wrong.* "With the power of my magic, and the power of my summon, I command thee to bring forth your total destruction, SCELDRANT'S COMET"

*An enormous comet enveloped with aurora coloured light plummeted from the sky and crashed into Ridley.*

Lance: *He watched a bomb-like explosion swirl into an aurora coloured mushroom cloud.* "Ooo, that'll leave a mark-" *His hair rapidly blew back.*

Ridley: *He flashstepped into the distance and instantly noticed a stream of smoke coming from his handless arm.* (When I flashstepped, I left part of my arm vulnerable to the beams-)

*Ridley looked up, watching a pulse of dirt and grass blow past him from the comet's explosion.*

Ridley: "Powerful-"

Lance: "Thankies." *He appeared several feet away from Ridley.*

Ridley: *He looked surprised, glaring at Lance in shock.* "How did you-?!"

Lance: "Hi-Ougi."

Ridley: "Yes, how did you-?!"

Lance: *He stared at Ridley's back, watching him twitch in shock.* "You OK?"

Ridley: *He looked behind him, noticing another copy.* "Where did you obtain this power?"

Lance: "Hi-Ougi."

Ridley: *He gasped with widening eyes, quickly looking back in front to the other copy of Lance.* (Two copies, each using Hi-Ougis?! This isn't possible! Not even I can!-)

Lance: "You were talkin' to me first, right?" *He stepped forward, drawing Ridley's attention.*

Ridley: "No matter-" *He swayed his arm, causing a swirl of aurora to envelop it.* "I will-"

Lance: "Mastered state of Alchemy and Crafting, pour the Neurons and Astragons into Ragnarok's formula, form and merge into our strongest creation!-"

Ridley: (Ragnarok?!)

Lance: "That's borin'!" *He smirked, staring at Ridley's back.* "Streaming sword, Icicle Stroke-"

Ridley: (But, Teresa-Terra's whatever ability is merely incredible speed, using two Ougis simultaneously-, no! Using two Hi-Ougis simultaneously!-)

Lance: *He watched the liquid glow and form around his body, slowly taking shape of a vehicle.* "Awesome!"

Lance: *He watched ice explode into claymores in each hand and noticed lightning spark inside them, causing the ice to glitter.* "Ice-chain Claymores."

Lance: *Another copy appeared on top of a turret, causing him to smirk in amazement.* "Whoa!"

Ridley: (I.. I can't believe what I'm witnessing-)

Lance: "Elemental Ragnatank." *The tank made charging sounds, causing him to aim the turret at Ridley.*

Lance: *He swayed the claymores to his side, jumping towards Ridley.* "You're gone!"

Ridley: *He frowned in anger and spun around, staring at the glittering ice claymores.* "No!"

Lance: *He jumped into striking distance, slicing downwards.* "Hah!"

Ridley: *He swayed to the side and avoided Lance's strike, watching the grass freeze and burn around his claymore.* (A manipulation of two elements?!)

Lance: *He raised the ice claymores, slashing across Ridley's face.* "Hmph."

Ridley: *He quickly blocked it with a cloud of aurora, noticing parts of it freeze and shatter to his feet.* (This technique? I don't believe it-)

Lance: *He flashstepped just behind Ridley and half smirked in a serious and confident manner.* "Hmph."

Ridley: *He watched slash-like strings of lightning freeze into cut-like ice around his body.* (How-?!) "That's enough, you foolish boy!"

Lance: *He squinted his eye, holding the turret with both hands.* "SURREAL PULSAR" *He shot a fluoro green, cannon-like ball of energy towards Ridley, causing the area to shine lime.*

Ridley: *He spiralled around and waved his hand, causing a swirl of aurora to hit Lance on the shoulder, twirling him around.* "Face your opponents!"

Lance: *He awkwardly faced Ridley and raised his ice claymores, readying to attack.* "Actually, you shouldn't force someone to do somethin' if-"

Ridley: *He twirled around and kicked Lance across the face, before flashstepping high into the air.* (Activating these aurora powers were amazing in itself.. But, this foolish boy!)

*Ridley looked down, watching the cannon-like ball explode where he stood.*

Lance: *He slid out of a green fluoro mist-like wave, noticing a crack in his claymore.* "Man-" *He spun around, throwing the broken claymore at Ridley.*

Ridley: *He hovered in the air, discreetly glancing at the tank in the corner of his eye.* (That Surreal Pulsar.. That was a Grand Remenistal in itself!-)

*Ridley frowned and focused his attention to the claymore, violently jabbing his aurora sword towards it.*

Ridley: (Trying to strike me in the air? It won't work-) *He watched the claymore shatter at the end of his sword, causing him to smirk.* (See.)

Lance: *He leant forward inside the tank, causing it to roll towards Ridley.* "Aim!"

Lance: *He looked down and nodded his head, aiming the turret at Ridley.* "Yea."

Ridley: (That ice weapon looked more studier than I thought-) *Streams of thick yellow fluoro lightning broke out of the ice, electrocuting him.* "Gargh."

*Ridley shouted in agonising pain and fell towards the ground, awkwardly landing on his feet.*

Lance: *He held the ice claymore in one hand, smirking at Ridley.* "Aha-"

Lance: "FLAME BOLT" *He pushed forward, shooting a cannon-like ball of fire towards Ridley.* "Awesome."

Ridley: *He noticed the area glow a red colour, causing him to awkwardly look to the side.* (That Hi-Ougi is still active?!)

Lance: *He sat inside the tank, watching lights fade away in a shutting down-like manner.* "We have enough for one more attack!"

Lance: *He looked past the fireball, aiming at Ridley.* "SURREAL PULSAR"

Ridley: (Damn-) *He listened to another laser-like shot echo from the tank and frowned, disappearing in a puff of smoke.*

Lance: *He smirked and lowered the glittering ice claymore, watching the tank disintegrate into nothing.* (Heh, that was awesome.) *He watched the cannon-like balls explode, squinting his eyes at their brightness.*

Ridley: *He appeared far into the distance, noticing a green and red explosion caused by Lance's tank.* (That type of Rosterology device.. It was similar to the world I was just in-)

*Ridley heard a crack and looked down, noticing blue flowers blossoming out of the ground.*

Ridley: "What?"

Lance: *He flashstepped next to Ridley, watching the flowers bloom.* "They look girly, but watch out!"

Ridley: *He frowned at Lance's attitude and flashstepped, as the flowers shot condensed sand bullets.* (How troubling. I'll bind his arms and legs.) *He frowned in thought, watching the area blur past him.*

Lance: (Where-?) *He scanned the area and noticed Ridley's image appear out of striking distance.* (There's our main man.)

Ridley: *He stepped back and looked at his missing hand, mumbling in recollection.* (Think, Ridley.. Calm yourself down and think rationally..)

Lance: *He dropped his ice claymore, watching it shatter away with a string of thick lightning.* (I don't know why.. But my confidence.. It's like, I can still feel the fear I had, but this confidence just outweighs it.)

*Ridley took a deep breath and slowly exhaled, trying to calm himself down.*

Ridley: (He's able to use his party members' abilities, the same as PKMY.. Not only that, he's also gained their attributes.. He moves like Teresa, chains his attacks with well-executed combos like PKMY, wields a sword like Cameron, possesses Remenistal power equal to Season, self-regenerates like he has Radiatons, controls that unusual weapon Tyler somehow gained into possession, and moves in an animal-like manner at dire times as if he were a Scoldrant User-)

Lance: *He watched the flowers wither and die, shrivelling back into the ground.* "Yep, that was a Flora Dasher alright."

Ridley: *He watched his hand regenerated itself, causing him to twiddle his newly formed fingers.* "Now-" *He flicked his wrist, causing a puff of aurora to form into a sword.*

Lance: *He looked at Ridley in a carefree manner and raised his hand, forming a fist.* "Really?" *He spoke to himself and smirked.* "Hi-Ougi."

Ridley: *Blood-like swirls of water spiralled around the aurora swords.* "I'll get you, young man!" *He stepped forward and started to charge towards Lance.* (I haven't exhausted half of my stamina, but it seems flashstepping around him has served me no good.)

Lance: *His hair turned into purple flames and fire swirled around his fists.* "Two fires burn as one and ignite our resolve, Solar Flare Snap."

Ridley: (Fire? His hair?!) *He ran into striking distance and jabbed the sword forward.*

Lance: "Wouldn't you be saying somethin' like-?" *He looked up in thought and waved his hand, knocking Ridley back with the fire-like aura around his hand.*

Ridley: *He slid back with a frown, watching his aurora sword distort into a wave of aura.* (His Roharnia must be on the opposite frequency to mine.)

Lance: "Don't keep chargin' at me like that, you foolish boy." *He rocked his head to each side, speaking in a stupid tone.*

Ridley: *He stopped and bent his knees, readying himself to charge.* "You're exactly right."

Lance: "Aha, wut?"

Ridley: *He grunted and quickly ran back into striking distance, as another aurora sword swirled into his hand.* "Take advice from the skilled and you shall be rewarded-"

Lance: "I don't like ya attitude-" *He punched forward, causing a blast of fire to burn past Ridley's head.*

Ridley: *He stepped to the side, ignoring the flames.* "Ougi."

Lance: "Ougi? Kool-"

Ridley: *He jabbed the sword towards Lance's chest.* (Alright, it was a quick plan-)

Lance: *He caught the sword with his burning hand and smirked.* "That was fast."

Ridley: *Another aurora sword puffed into his other hand, causing him to raise it.* "Harh!" *He lunged the other sword towards Lance's face.*

Lance: *He caught the sword with his other hand.* "Didn't see that comin'-"

Ridley: "Rotting Swarm."

Lance: "Aye?" *Black, white and aurora swords materialised around Lance and shot into his arms and legs.* "Argh!"

Ridley: *He smirked, trying to pull the swords out of Lance's grip.* "I knew you would've had some sort of defensive skill if I went for your head or chest-"

Lance: *His eye twitched in pain.* "Trw-u-u-ue." *His voice gargled on water.*

Ridley: "Gargling blood already?" *He smiled.* "Marvellous-"

Lance: "Gargling Whirlpool." *He coughed out a vortex of water in Ridley's face.*

Ridley: *He let go of the swords, causing them to puff into swirls of aurora.* "Via the mouth?" *He mumbled to himself, watching water drip off his face.*

Lance: *He frowned, watching more swords stab into his body.* (Damn.)

Ridley: "Did you just spit in my face!?" *He spoke in realisation, wiping his face in disgust.*

Lance: "Nah-" *He wiped the dripping water off his chin.*

Ridley: *He cautiously stepped back, observing Lance.* (So, the only things that have worked are combos and multi-based attacks-)

Lance: "These effin' swords!" *He opened his mouth and an orchestra of violins played, rippling the air around his head.*

Ridley: (What the Astragons is that?!)

Lance: "Frenzy Symphony." *He shouted out a vortex of sound, disintegrating Ridley's swords around his body into nothing.* "Phew-"

Ridley: (The number two's Azure Burst?!)

Lance: *He glared at Ridley, ignoring the blood which streamed down his arms.* "DRAGON'S BREATH" *He hopped on one foot and punched towards Ridley, causing a serpent of lightning to roar thunder.*

*Thick red streams of lightning sparked around the serpent, causing flashes of light to brighten the surrounding area.*

Ridley: (How can he possess such power? I've researched nearly my entire adult life to obtain this power!-) *He turned around and jumped high into the air, as black radiant wings erupted from his back.*

Lance: *He looked up and watched Ridley fly high into the air, ignoring thick streams of red lightning flash across his face.* "Flyin'? No fair!"

Ridley: *He looked behind him and noticed the mountain-sized dragon-like serpent closely follow him through the air.* (It's following me?!)

Lance: *He watched the lightning spiral higher into the air, causing the area to darken around him.* (It's like a storm..)

Ridley: *He spiralled further into the air, keeping his distance from the lightning.* (This level of manipulation would require immense Astragons-)

Lance: *He looked at his wrist and shook his head, as if he was hiding something.* (I'll save that for last-) *He spread his arms, causing a small purple ring to spiral around his feet.*

Ridley: "Harh!" *He sliced behind him, causing a visible black air slash to break part of the dragon's head.* (At the very least it's not indestructible.)

Lance: "My Rostical explodes deep in the hot abyss, grander than the seven stars of The Astral Plains, blast, ignite, brighten the area with your spectacular array-" *The purple rings expanded, forming into a glowing glyph under his feet.*

Ridley: *He watched the lightning continue to slither after him.* (My plan to bind him failed, what to do next? Think, Ridley, think.)

Lance: "I shall a-tear your insignificant bonds, with the seraphic blood, this battle will finish!-" *The rings of purple glyphs rose up and spiralled all around his body, blowing his purple fire-like hair to each side.*

Ridley: (I will nullify his lightning with-) *He straightened his arm behind him, causing white lightning to spark around his aurora sword.*

Lance: "DIMENSION CASCADIA"
Ridley: "HOLYSHA-" *An explosion of purple fireworks knocked him off course, causing the lightning to catch up and to violently static the vicinity around him.*

Lance: *He grunted in deep concentration and kept a fixated stare on Ridley, slowly raising his hands into the air.* (This Rostickal is wicked!-)

Ridley: *He spun around, watching red lightning stream all around him.* (What was that blast?! Whatever it was, I'm now trapped in this-)

*Lance watched purple fireworks explode all across the sky, listening to their thunder-like rumbles with each explosion.*

Lance: (It's like a new year celebration or somethin'! Man.. I shouldn't have given Season a bad time about it before.)

Ridley: *Thick streams of static lightning and explosions of fireworks around him caused his body to violently shake in pain.* (Evade!-) *His wings moved like razor blades, causing his image to disappear.*

Lance: *He noticed Ridley's image vanish, causing him to lower his arms.* "This is so kool-"

Ridley: "Cool?" *His image appeared in a cluster of aurora swirls behind Lance.*

Lance: "Aye?" *He looked over his shoulder, ignoring the flashes of lightning shine on the grass around him.*

Ridley: "Time for some black lightning, since you seem to like it so much!" *He grunted and smirked with anger.*

Lance: "Yea! Lightning's the bomb." *He quickly covered his mouth in shock.* "The bomb? Why did I say somethin' so lame-?"

Ridley: *He straightened his arm at Lance, causing him to pay attention.* "Darkened volt, burn a cross and cause the opponent to halt, let your existence fade-"

Lance: "There's a spark in no time, let your colours burst and shine, allow your existence to fade-" *He straightened his arm towards Ridley.*

Ridley and Lance: "NIGHTSHADE" *They shouted and watched black swirls of lightning spark around their hands, cueing them to blast two thick streams of lightning towards each other.*

Ridley: (His Nightshade has a different incantation?)

*The lightning connected, causing sounds of scraping glass to echo.*

Ridley: *He grunted in shock, watching his wrist violently shake.* (Nightshade was one of the first Remenistal skills I learnt. I've mastered this, why is it on par with his!?)

Lance: "Does it confuse you?"

Ridley: "Hmm?"

Lance: "Why I'm so strong?"

Ridley: "Humour me."

Lance: "I have the drive and hopes of all those you defeated."

Ridley: "Don't make me laugh. I have an important dream to follow. I have an important destiny in front of me."

Lance: "Destiny?"

Ridley: (To keep peace-)

Lance: *He glanced at the lightning.* "Seems like neither are budgin' at all, should we try somethin' else?"

Ridley: "This isn't a game!" *He grunted and used both arms, causing his lightning to thicken.*

Lance: *His arm started to shake.* (His lightning is pushin' mine back-)

Ridley: *He smirked as if he knew he'd win.* (If he tries Teresa's technique again, I know what to do.)

Lance: *He smirked and flashstepped, causing Ridley's massive stream of black lightning to blast across the land.* "Myrror Shield." *He appeared behind Ridley, as fireflies materialised in the air around him.*

Ridley: *He spun around on one foot and shot out a massive stream of white lightning.* "Harh harh!"

*A red glass-like shield expanded in front of Lance and instantly shattered to the touch of Ridley's white lightning.*

Lance: *He stared at the lightning with widening eyes.* "It broke-?" *The lightning shot into his chest and blasted out his back, causing him to choke in pain.*

Ridley: "As predicted."

Lance: *He stumbled back and dropped to his knees.* "Man-"

Ridley: *He raised both arms in the air and focused, causing a massive swirl of aurora to sway above him.* "I'll slice your body in half!"

Lance: (Shit-) *He looked down, watching water swirl around the hole in his chest.*

Ridley: *He opened his hands, causing the aura to slowly take shape of a sword.* "Are you ready, for justice?"

Lance: *He slowly pointed his finger at the forming aurora sword above Ridley.* "Typhoon's Pulse." *A hole suddenly shot into the aura-like sword, causing it to lose its shape.*

Ridley: "Useless-" *He swayed his hand and the aurora filled the hole back in.*

Lance: *He coughed and his fire-like hair extinguished back to normal.* "No-" *The fire around his hands swirled out, causing him to place his hands on the ground in exhaustion.*

Ridley: "Looks like you're at your limit."

Lance: "That lightnin', how did you use somethin' so strong?"

Ridley: "Well, since you're about to die and asked nicely, I guess I'll tell you." *The sword's appearance hardened, causing him to grab it with both hands.* "With the knowledge of Remenistic formula, I used the incantation then inscribed the glyph to Holyshade on my arm."

Lance: "Inscribed?"

Ridley: "It was something Vanguard discovered when fighting a Remenistal User named Ginger."

Lance: "I don't-"

Ridley: *He nudged his head at his arm, revealing glyphic markings cut into his skin.* "See?"

Lance: "That's pretty kool." *He observed the markings and grunted in pain, slowly standing up.*

Ridley: *He flashstepped in front of Lance, lunging into striking distance.* "Yeah, it sure was-" *He firmly held the massive steel-like aurora sword and quickly spun his body, slicing down Lance.*

Lance: "Ougi-" *He flashstepped far into the distance and sighed in pain, dropping to the ground.* "Incantation Exploitation."

Ridley: *He hit the ground and awkwardly stepped forward, nearly losing his balance.* (That man! Flashstepping the moment my attack connected-)

Lance: "METEOR SWARM"

Ridley: "Tssk." *He frowned at Lance, watching aurora lights shine in the ground from his sword before erupting into the air.*

Lance: (Not sure if it's the excitement, but I'm startin' to feel something, not good-)

Ridley: *He stared at Lance who kneeled far in the distance.* (How can he flashstep? My lightning-)

*Ridley frowned at Lance triggering a flashback of the white lightning shooting through his chest.*

Ridley: (I got him in a critical area-) *A meteor plummeted through the sky and crashed into the ground near him, causing it to explode and rumble.*

Lance: *He started to sweat, as he looked up with his bright violet eyes.* (Nice-) *He smirked, watching hundreds of meteors flicker in the sky.*

Ridley: *He looked up with a dumbfounded look, dropping the aurora sword with widening eyes.* (I have to focus a lot of Neurons in this!) "Swirling shadows flock, with the motion all will block, darkness strikes hearts with fear, NIGHT SPHERE"

*A black sphere of shadow rose around Ridley, forming into a shield.*

Ridley: "MYSTIC SHIELD" *A white shield flashed over the dark shield around him.* (Meteor Swarm.. But, how?!)

*Ridley looked up with gritted teeth and braced himself, watching meteors flicker directly above him.*

Lance: *He watched violent eruptions and explosions of bright orange fire form around Ridley.* (I have a feelin' this didn't or won't kill him.) *He watched patiently, as the area consumed with blazing fire.*

Ridley: *He crouched in a foetus position, as the area outside the shield flickered with flames.* (Come on, almost finished-) *Sounds of cracking glass could be heard, as a small stream of flames spewed into the shield.* (Argh. Hot!)

Lance: *A heartbeat-like pulse thumped through his body, causing him to look behind him at the party.* (Aye?)

*Lance watched the party slowly regain their consciousness in the far distance, causing him to smirk with exhaustion.*

Lance: (Looks like they get to see the Consultant dickhead, get his arse handled by me-)

*The last of the meteors smashed into the ground, causing the flames to slowly die out.*

Ridley: *He took deep breaths, as the white and black shield shattered to the steaming ground around him.* "My-" *He spoke under his breath and panted in anger, as sweat dripped off his face.*

Lance: *He grunted and stood up with gritted teeth.* (I'm almost out of ideas.)

Ridley: "It was getting very hot in there." *He mumbled to himself and slowly stood up, noticing his burns slowly stop healing themselves.* (Excuse me? My self-healing abilities have slowed down to the point where it will only heal half?)

Lance: *He shook his head and dropped to his knees.* "I can't feel my legs, shit!"

Ridley: *He sighed in anger, looking at Lance with satisfaction.* "Now I can finally sense he's almost at his limit.."

Lance: (I just summoned meteors..) *He chuckled in thought and stared at the ground, noticing his arms shake.*

Ridley: *He took a step forward towards Lance and stopped.* (Before I carelessly walk into attacking distance, it seems he's able to use all the techniques of his party members.) *He stretched and cracked his body.*

Lance: *He wiped sweat off his forehead with his shoulder and grunted.* "Wat's takin' him so long?"

Ridley: (If I mentally brace myself with every possible technique those party members possess, then I won't be so surprised like I have been for most of this fight.) *He smirked in realisation and flashstepped.*

Lance: *He watched Ridley's image disappear, causing his eyes to widen in shock.* (He's making his move-)

Ridley: "Hello again." *He flashstepped into striking distance in front of Lance and smirked.*

Lance: (He could still flashstep!-) *He looked surprised and frowned, hiding his shocked feelings.* "You shouldn't be smirkin'-"

Ridley: "Oh, but why?" *He spoke with an upbeat attitude, concealing his exhaustion from Lance.*

Lance: "I beat you."

Ridley: "Admirable attempt... But a worthy foe? Never." *He cautiously walked up to Lance and looked down with an enormous smirk.* "I will finally end your miserable suffering."

Lance: "I think it's time to use my strongest Rostickal."

Ridley: (Stronger than Meteor Swarm and Solar Flare?) *He stared at Lance and chuckled.* "Alright, sure, finish me." *He bent down and smirked in Lance's face.*

----------

Sofia: "Y-You can't defeat me? I win the game-"

Valkyrie: "Astragenicons perform and dance the sacred steps, Neuragenicons light up and form yourselves-"

*Two glyphic rings spiralled in front and behind Pepper, catching Sofia's attention.*

Valkyrie: "The seeker and master of Remenistal thy ask upon the Radiagenicons to give life-"

*The glyphs expanded around Pepper, slowly spiralling around her.*

Valkyrie: "Our emotions and beings become one and harness the power of our bonds-"

Sofia: (What is she doing? The strongest Rostical? Don't make me laugh!) *She watched a pentagram-shaped glyph spiral around her and she dragged herself along the ground, trying to squirm away.*

Valkyrie: "The words of a healer, purity of spirits, thy alone will purify the doubts in your heart. Forbidden and secretive knowledge thy demand, The Voice of On let me hear your words-"

Sofia: *She watched a mass of symbols, glyphs and unreadable texts float in the air, forming glyphic-like walls around the pentagram.* (This is a ridiculously long incantation, perhaps she's bluffing?! To teach me a lesson?!) "Yes, a lesson! Hahehahe-"

Valkyrie: "The shape of this holy pentagram form the door to your existence-"

*A white platform made of symbols drew itself underneath Sofia, causing her eyes to shine.*

Sofia: *She watched the glyphs around her glow in reaction to Pepper's voice.* (What?!)

*Sigil-like glyphs and unreadable symbols rose up from the ground, generating powerful swirls of wind.*

Sofia: *Her eyes widened in shock.* (She's serious-) *She watched the air suddenly blur with power, giving the illusion it was raining.*

*The glyphs vibrated and hummed under Sofia, causing light to glitter around her.*

Valkyrie: "Any last words?"

Sofia: "No more continues.." *She paused and stopped struggling to move, unintentionally exhaling in pain.*

Valkyrie: "What?"

Sofia: "I'm sorry, my love." *She looked up into the sky, smirking in a defeated manner.*

*Swirls of solidifying light slowly drew themselves towards Sofia, clustering around her.*

Valkyrie: "SERAPHIC GATE"

*A bright white beam violently exploded from the glyphic platform, erupting high into the air.*

Valkyrie: *She looked up, watching the clouds shine and spiral around the light.* "May the Radiagenicons ease your spirit to The Astral Plains."

Sofia: (You filthy dirty lamps left me for dead and I'm the one that suffers like this? Hahehahe, make things right, my love-)

*The clouds sizzled and the light pulsated, causing the air itself to vibrate.*

Valkyrie: (It took two seconds for Seraphic Gate to reach the thermosphere? A side-effect of The Philosopher's Heart taking so long to be activated.)

Sofia: "Game over." *She closed her eyes, as her body burnt and vaporised into the light.*

Valkyrie: *She looked away and stared past the blowing trees into the distance.* "Power of the forbidden spirits, come to my command, with seraphic powers-"

*Small orbs of white light floated into the sky, as the glyphs, symbols and texts disintegrated into the air.*

Valkyrie: "TELEPORTATION" *She suddenly disappeared in a flash of purple light.*

*Pepper stepped off a fading purple glyph, blowing ferns, grass and dirt away.*

Valkyrie: "Comrades-" *She walked towards the unconscious party members and clicked her fingers, causing them all to gasp awake.*

Alicia: "W-Wharh?"
Celest: "A-Argh?"
Lorilei: "O-Oh?"
Locki: "P-Pepper." *He gasped and leant up, causing his armour to rattle.*

Valkyrie: "Thy sensed another problem that disrupted order of peace, where is this man?"

Lorilei: *She stared at Pepper in awe.* (She's beautiful.)

Locki: "Pepper." *He smirked with amazement.*

Valkyrie: "Listen and concentrate! This vessel has suffered no permanent damages, but she will if my spirit is contained for an extended duration-"

Celest: "Excuse the intrusion, mistress. Alicia, where was the Consultant said to be?"

Alicia: "Th-The-"

Valkyrie: *She nodded her head, as if she could understand Alicia's thoughts.* "Thy understand-" *She waved her arm and the party was blinded with a bright flash of white light.*

----------

Ridley: "So what is this special Remenistal?"

Lance: *He looked down and appeared sad.* "I never used it because it felt wrong."

Ridley: "Wrong?"

Lance: "It reminds me of what happened."

Ridley: *He frowned, suddenly punching Lance across the face.* "Foolish, wasting my time like this."

Lance: *He leant to the side, spitting out blood.* "Tssk." (I'll have to put my everythin' into this, even the last Newgong and Astragong of my being.)

Ridley: *He slowly stood up straight.* "You probably don't have anything-"

Lance: "Untouchable flames, splinter from the divine spirit, burning courage engrave my immense power, scorch thout foe-" *He quickly shouted out the incantation and jumped up with all his strength, lunging himself towards Ridley.*

Ridley: *His eyes widened in sheer shock.* "What incantation is that-?"

Lance: "PHOENIX BLASTER" *He punched Ridley in the gut, as an eruption of black flames blasted Ridley in the air.*

Ridley: *He coughed out blood which sizzled and turned to steam before it flicked out of arm's reach.* (These Neurons!-)

Lance: *Black lines spread all over his body from the phoenix tattoo which was kept hidden under his bangle.* (Old man...)

*Lance collapsed to the ground and rolled onto his back, watching the flames screech like a bird.*

Lance: (Millard.)

Ridley: *His arms and legs burnt into ash.* (No, my dream! Our dream!) *His hair singed into nothing and his skin burnt, due to the black flames which enveloped him.*

Lance: *He watched the black fire splinter in the breeze.* (He just got.. Owned.)

Cameron: *Bird-like screeches caught his attention, causing him to look up.* (What the lost Astragons is that?!) *He shouted in thought, staring at the black flames with widening eyes.*

Ridley: (Gabby, all I wanted was to acquire peace.. People understand pain, that's why, I needed to do the things I did, in order to obtain peace-)

*Ridley looked up, staring at a light only he could see.*

--

*A younger version of Ridley and Gabriel chased each other through a peaceful appearing forest.*

Gabriel: "No, Ridz!" *He chuckled and jumped into a running stream, hopping onto the other side.*

Ridley: "Haha!"

Gabriel: "I'm so happy we finally decided what we're going to do in the future!"

Ridley: "Yes!"

Gabriel and Ridley: "Peace!"

--

Ridley: (We became friends because of a horrible Neuron illness we both had when we were younger.. The similarities in pain, that allowed us to understand each other.) *His clothes started to wither and charcoal, puffing away into ash.*

--

Gabriel: "We'll make sure nobody ever suffers the way we did." *He chuckled at Ridley, skipping over rocks in a playful manner.*

Ridley: *He giggled in a child-like manner, enthusiastically nodding his head.* "Right! I'll be by your side until the end of time!"

Gabriel: "No, we'll stand by each other's side 'til the end of time!" *He quickly spun around and leant down, helping Ridley onto the rock next to him.* "We'll be the heroes that spread peace and justice across the lands."

Ridley: "Yeah!"

--

Ridley: (When you've been cut you begin to heal, so, I had to inflict the people of darkness with pain.. If everyone understood what pain felt like, then every person would be able to understand one another-) *He closed his eyes, causing tears to run down his cheeks before evaporating into steam.* (The irony is in the diverse group that has sought my death, it proves that our theory of pain is true-)

Lance: *His vision blurred and his breathing slowed down.* (This power is escapin'..) *The Soul Links became visible to each party member before snapping off like strings.*

Ridley: (Would I have done things differently? Maybe the methods, but I wouldn't change the goal.. If anything, I hope my death births good things from you meddling children.. I hope I get to see you again, Gabby-) *The fire phoenix suddenly and violently exploded into a massive black flare in the sky.*

Lezard: *He regained consciousness and felt hot gusts of wind, causing him to look up towards the sky.* "..."

Tyler: *He groaned and sighed, noticing a strong wind blow downwards.* (The air, it's hot-) *He looked up and instantly stared at the black flames in amazement.* (It's huge!-)

Teresa: (Inconceivable! He has surpassed even the Consultants themselves!)

Lezard: *He watched the fire swirl in the sky.* (Powerful and beautiful, like my parents.)

*Lezard held onto his cone-shaped hat, slightly surprised he was still wearing it.*

Lezard: (Father, mother monster.. Sister monster.. Please, everyone be safe!)

Holland: *He stood up and noticed Lance lying on the ground.* "His breathing-" *The purple ring around his iris spiralled, magnifying his vision.* "He's not breathing!"

PKMY: *Her skin appeared blue, as she twitched with an emotionless face.* "H-Holly-" *She whispered, catching his attention.*

Holland: *He looked down and noticed her appearance, filling him with terror.* "N-No-" *He dropped to the ground beside PKMY.*

Season: *He leant up with a grunt-like mumble and stared at the plumes of black flames, watching them disappear from the sky.* "D-Did Lance really do it?"

Tyler: "W-We have to see if he's alright."

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She awkwardly stood up in pain, ignoring her pale appearing skin.* "I-I will get him-"

*A blinding white light flashed in front of the party, drawing all their attention towards it.*

Season: "Who's there?"

Cameron: *He blinked several times, noticing five party members in the fading light.* "I do not recognise-"

Alicia: *She stepped forward, causing the party to relax.* "Where's Lance?"

Tyler: "Over there-" *He urgently pointed in front behind her.* "But hurry, he's not breathing."

Alicia: "N-No-" *She gasped with sudden terror and quickly turned around.*

Valkyrie: *She watched splinters of ash swirl in the air and took a step forward, grunting with respect.* "The Consultant's power was equivalent to Sofia's, yet, you all were able to defeat him."

Season: *He looked at Pepper, causing him to smile with uncertainty.* (Is that-?)

Valkyrie: "Thy am impressed."

Lorilei: "Mistress?" *She sounded surprised.*

Valkyrie: "Thy will fully heal all your wounds, but, it won't stop the inevitable sleeping your bodies will require. Tell me where to send thou all."

Season: *He smiled in disbelief and hope, as if he wasn't sure if he should say anything.* "Th-The Sheridan."

Valkyrie: *She glanced at Season and nodded her head, as if she could read his mind.* "Thy understand-" *She raised her hand and readied to click her finger.*

Tyler: "Pepper?"

Valkyrie: "Hmph." *She chuckled with a slight smile and clicked her finger, causing a strong blast of white light to blind the party.*

Chapter 3: Relaxing Tenses

Lance: "Hmm..." *He moaned and slowly opened his eyes, finding himself lying on a bed.* (Huh?) *He moaned again and blinked, glancing across an unfamiliar room with blurred vision.*

Alicia: *She slept in a wooden chair, awkwardly resting her head on the bed by Lance's feet.* "Sh-She's beautiful-the lights-she looks like Pepper-"

Lance: *He leant up, welcoming Alicia with a smile.* "Hey-"

Alicia: *She inhaled loudly through her nose and leant up, watching the pendant dangle from her neck as she leant over the bed.* "H-Huh?"

Lance: "'Sup, shit nugget?" *He mumbled with a widening smile.*

Alicia: "You're-?" *She looked at Lance and smiled in excitement, rubbing her eyes.* "You're up."

Lance: "Yea, I thought so too, but since you said it, I definitely know I'm awake now, thanks-"

Alicia: *She quickly stood up and jumped on top of Lance, giving him a warm hug.* "You're finally awake."

Lance: *He smirked and held her tightly while lovingly kissing her on the head.* "So, how long have I been asleep this time?"

Alicia: "Seven days."

Lance: (A week!-)

Alicia: (I'm so happy you're okay.) *She whispered in thought, cupping her pendant in happiness.*

Lance: "That's a long time, aye.." *He brushed hair out of Alicia's face.*

Alicia: "Yep."

Lance: "Wat's everyone doin'? Where are we? Wait-" *He unintentionally spoke with a rising voice and leant up, looking at Alicia in a worried manner.* "Wat happened to the Consultant?!"

Alicia: "Shh-" *She looked to each side and pointed across the room, drawing Lance's attention to patients resting in single beds.*

Lance: "My bad."

Alicia: "Umm-" *She closed her eyes and slightly frowned with concentration, biting her bottom lip.*

Lance: *He focused his attention back to Alicia, hiding his smile.* "Wat are ya doin'?"

Alicia: *She leant back in concentration, waving her hand across Lance's body.* "With my new abilities, I can feel damages with my Radiatons."

Lance: "Aye?"

Alicia: "It's like, running your hand along a smooth surface, and when you feel a ditch or a bump, that's where the damage is."

Lance: (Stupid beautiful bitch..) *He rolled his eyes and chuckled with blushing cheeks.*

Alicia: *She nodded her head in a reassuring manner, opening her eyes.* "You're alright to get up."

Lance: "Pssht, I was gonna get up anyways."

Alicia: "Tee hee."

Lance: "Now, you wanna get off of me? It's goin' to look suss if someone walks in."

Alicia: "Tee hee, yep."

Lance: "You must be losin' weight too, you didn't crush my bones like ya used to." *He smirked and gently held Alicia's arm, helping her off the bed.*

Alicia: "Let's go for a walk, I can tell you what happened."

Lance: "It better be epic." *He slowly raised the sheets and inspected his body, nodding his head in approval.* (I got clothes on this time-)

*Lance grunted and jumped out of the bed, stretching his arms in a child-like manner.*

Lance: "So-" *He looked down to polished floors and up to the roof, raising an eyebrow in confusion.* "Did ya mention where we were?"

Alicia: "We're in the castle of Silver Wind Island." *She walked into the hallway and spun around, facing Lance with her arms behind her back.*

Lance: "And everyone else?"

Alicia: "Excuse me, grottom bottom."

Lance: "Aye?" *He stood at the doorway and looked at Alicia with a curious and puzzled smirk.*

Alicia: "Tee hee, isn't my company good enough?" *She slightly swayed to the side, giggling in an innocent manner.*

Lance: *He walked into the hallway and stood on the long red carpet.* "Nah, wateva." *He chuckled and gently kissed Alicia on the lips, holding her hand in a loving manner.*

Alicia: "Season and Tyler are in the research facility a few floors up."

Lance: "Why don't we say hello?"

Alicia: "Umm, Season-" *She looked down, tapping the red carpet with the tip of her foot.* "He requested to do something by himself." (.. He seemed really sad-)

Lance: "OK, wat about the others?"

Alicia: "Holland left the city to defeat some of the remaining skeleton creatures."

Lance: "Skree?"

Alicia: *She nodded her head, looking back up to Lance.* "Lezard said they're called Darkwings."

Lance: "Darkwings.. Does that mean we lost?" *He spoke with anticipation, looking at Alicia in a serious yet mature manner.*

Alicia: "S-Sorry?"

Lance: "If those creatures are still left, then the Consultant is still alive?"

Alicia: *She giggled and rubbed his arm.* "You defeated him with a Grand Rostical no one besides Lezard and Teresa had seen before."

Lance: *He looked down, discreetly smiling in relief.* (So, that defeated him-) "Watta 'bout Teresa and Docta Jingles?"

Alicia: "PKMY woke up a few days earlier than you. She was in a critical condition for some time."

Lance: "And Teresa?"

Alicia: "She's with her."

Lance: "So, where are they?"

Alicia: "They went for a walk, I'm not sure where they are now."

Lance: "Why?"

Alicia: "Because I was with you, waiting for you to wake up."

Lance: (.. I don't deserve her, aye.) *He started to walk down the stairs with Alicia and half smirked to himself, looking away with blushing cheeks.* "Oh, fairo."

----------

*Holland, Nathan, Blake and Cameron walked through a thick forest.*

Nathan: *He looked around with the sword raised, as strings of dust blew over his shoulder.* "Do any of you sense any more?"

Holland: "I think we might have got them all."

Blake: *He strutted up to a nearby tree and placed his hand on it, causing Nathan to stare at him in a curious manner.* "They say-"

*Blake paused and looked up to the rustling leaves as if they were communicating to each other.*

Blake: "There's apparently a Spacial Funnel somewhere up ahead hey."

Cameron: *He glanced at the party, nodding his head in a professional manner.* "It would not hurt to check."

Nathan: "This is the last area Dawn said those creatures spawned from, we might as well ensure it's all been checked."

Holland: "Yeah." *He grunted in agreement.*

Blake: "And, for all we know, those fugly things could breed-" *He stepped away from the tree and pulled a disgusted look, shivering at the thought.*

Nathan: *He stepped forward, causing the party to walk deeper through the forest.* (Walking through this forest peacefully.. It's relaxing, but I've somehow grown used to Lezard being annoying.)

----------

*Teresa and PKMY sat on an ancient stone bridge, listening to bird and monkey-like noises from the forest around them.*

PKMY: *She glanced behind her and stared at the long set of stairs which travelled up, giving the illusion it led towards the sky.* "It's fine to admit it."

Teresa: "Tcch."

PKMY: "I miss her too." *She looked down to her lap, playing with a string of grass in her hands.*

Teresa: "Indeed." *She looked through the cracks of the trees, staring up into the sky.*

PKMY: "So, this is where you created that seal-?" *She looked at Teresa and reached up, gently running her finger along Teresa's forehead in a sisterly manner.*

Teresa: "No, there is a city located on the top of these stairs, hidden in a Spacial Funnel."

PKMY: "Eh?"

Teresa: "It is where Joy, Lupton and Chrisma are from."

PKMY: (Her friends..) *She nodded her head in understanding, refocusing her attention back to the grass in her hand.* "You were always so secretive."

Teresa: "It was my role as a number one captain. The less you knew, the better."

PKMY: "Yea.. Makes sense." *She sighed under her breath.*

Teresa: "Nevertheless, I owe you an apology."

PKMY: "Eh?"

Teresa: "I am sorry."

PKMY: "Sorry for wat?"

Teresa: "The way I have acted towards you."

PKMY: "I-?"

Teresa: "Amy. I had not realised it then, but I focused on my own desires."

PKMY: *She looked at Teresa in confusion.* "You never acted badly towards me."

Teresa: "Although that is true, I never treated you like a sister."

PKMY: "Terra.."

Teresa: "And for that, I apologise."

PKMY: (It's obvious she's finally removed the seal.)

Teresa: "I have treated everyone who cared about me, with-?"

PKMY: "No emotions."

Teresa: "Precisely."

PKMY: "Don't apologise. I would've done the same if I was in your position."

Teresa: *Her eyes shined gold.* "It was ironic to the point of almost feeling like a punishment, that when I sealed my emotions, I also sealed this power."

PKMY: "How is that irony?"

Teresa: "I ran through many simulations to find the best results in defeating the Consultant, one of the variables that impacted those results was my emotions. It was evident that I had to remove the variable if I ever desired the most favourable outcome, and then the incidents that transpired with mother-" *She paused as she started to grow emotional.*

PKMY: "It's OK-"

Teresa: *She unintentionally ignored PKMY.* "Without emotions, I truly believed I would be a better fighter-"

PKMY: "And you were."

Teresa: *Her eyes watered and she leant on PKMY's shoulder.* "Indeed."

PKMY: "Why are you sad? We defeated the Consultant."

Teresa: "Hoh?"

PKMY: "Your emotions, it's also kinda wearing off on me too." *She pretended to smile.*

Teresa: *She sniffed and smirked.* "I have felt uneasy though."

PKMY: "Why is that?"

Teresa: *She pushed herself off PKMY's shoulder and wiped under her eyes.* "These past few days have been unnaturally quiet."

PKMY: "You mean relaxing?"

Teresa: *She smiled and nodded her head.* "Hmm."

PKMY: *She looked down with a worried expression on her face.* "There's something that's been on my mind that the Consultant said."

Teresa: "Yes?"

PKMY: "He told Season he destroyed Surpreon-"

Teresa: *Her eyes widened as if she forgot.* "I have forgotten!" *She stood up with urgency.*

PKMY: "Wat?" *She looked up puzzled.*

Teresa: "It is true. We need to assist Season."

PKMY: "I-It is true?" *She spoke under her breath, slowly standing up in shock.*

Teresa: "Here-" *She closed her eyes and freed her mind, causing PKMY to gasp.*

PKMY: *Images of Surpreon in ruins, flashed in her mind.* "No..."

Teresa: "Just before we left this sunrise, Season was taking Tyler to Surpreon to check his findings. I can not believe something to that extreme and importance slipped my mind."

PKMY: "In your defence, your memory has been cloudy since you've had problems with that Grand Seal."

Teresa: "Indeed-" *She presented her hand to PKMY.*

PKMY: "Let's be there, for our big stupid brother."

Teresa: *She smiled.* (Caesar.) *PKMY grabbed her hand, causing their images to disappear in a flash of white light.*

----------

*Season and Tyler stood next to each other inside the research facility, watching Dawn prepare the researchers for a glyph.*

Dawn: *She glanced at Season and Tyler, pushing her glasses up with one finger.* "It should be ready shortly."

Season: "That would be excellent, thank you."

Tyler: *He smiled, adjusting the RPG bag.* (It's great how we're able to teleport now.)

Madora: *She flicked her long black hair and sighed, hobbling into the research facility.* "I just thought I should let you know I'll be returning back home for a while-"

Tyler: "Madora!"

Season: *He turned around and greeted her with a smile.* "How are you feeling?"

Madora: "Oh." *She looked at Season and Tyler startled as if she wasn't expecting them and smiled.* "I'm feeling much better, thank you."

Season: "Splendid."

Tyler: "Umm, s-so.." *He looked at Madora and paused.*

Madora: "Deary?"

Tyler: "If you don't mind me asking, what was wrong with you?"

Dawn: "Although, we aren't entirely sure what was the cause of it, thanks to research we now have speculations about the pulse."

Madora: "..." *She chuckled to herself as if Dawn was right.*

Tyler: "The pulse?"

Dawn: "The pulse which disabled the ability to teleport."

Tyler: "Ah." *He nodded his head in an interested manner, giving Dawn more of his attention.*

Season: "Hmm? What has the pulse got to do with Tyler's question?"

Dawn: "Research believes that the pulse was indeed the factor which rendered Madora in that dull-like daze."

Madora: *She hobbled towards Season, slowly nodding her head in agreement.* "I am one with Astragons. As fortunate as it may sound, it seemed when the Consultant was defeated the seal broke, and therefore, allowed me to return to normal."

Season: "Surely you could have prevented or found a way to block the symptoms you displayed?"

Madora: "Perhaps, but if I had known about the pulse sooner, I may have been able to do so."

Season: (As I thought, but I wanted to satisfy my curiosity-)

Researcher: "Ma'am. It's ready!"

Dawn: "Excellent, activate it now."

Researcher: "Yes." *He grunted and faced the Rosterology console.*

Dawn: *She rubbed several bandages on her arms caused by a Darkwing attack.* "The glyph is being prepared now." *She glanced at Season and walked away, hiding the pain in her arm.*

Season: "Thank you."

Madora: "How is everyone? I heard from Alicia that these creatures broke into the castle."

Dawn: "Yeah, we're fine." *She bent down and shuffled through papers, brushing Madora off with a wave of her hand.*

Madora: "There will be a time to congratulate your efforts later."

Tyler: (Later?)

Researcher: *Several images popped up on the screen, causing him to nod his head.* "Activating the glyph now."

Madora: "So, what are you two doing now?"

Season: "Hermm." *He mumbled awkwardly.*

Tyler: "T-To Surpreon-"

*A purple glyph drew itself on the ground, catching Tyler's attention.*

Madora: (Surpreon-) *She looked up and smiled.* "Be sure to come back here. We'll need closure."

Season: "Closure?"

Madora: "Yes." *She turned away, suddenly disappearing in a flash of aurora light.*

Season: *He stared in the space Madora stood, nervously pondering to himself.* (What Ridley told me.. I hope that it isn't true.)

Tyler: *The last line of the glyph connected, causing it to glow purple.* "Season." *He stepped towards the glyph and faced Season, waiting for his response.*

Season: "Oh right, hohoho." *He turned around and walked straight past Tyler towards the glyph.*

Tyler: *He watched Season disappear in a flash of purple light, causing him to smirk in admiration.* (Being away from Surpreon for so long, I actually kind of feel homesick.) *He chuckled to himself and shook his head, taking a step towards the glyph.*

?????: "Tyler."

Tyler: "Sorry?" *He turned around and noticed Chrisma slide into the room with a childish smirk on her face.*

Chrisma: "Tyler! Oh, get in?!" *She groaned under her breath, running towards Tyler.*

Tyler: "I'm sorry, got to go-" *He quickly trotted onto the glyph and disappeared in a flash of purple light.*

Dawn: *She stood up and slammed her hands on the desk she was using, looking at Chrisma in frustration.* "No yelling or running in the research facility!"

Chrisma: "Oh bless-" *She faced Dawn and nervously grabbed onto her robes, bowing in respect.* "Sorry."

Dawn: "What have you got to say for yourself?!"

Chrisma: "For.. For research?" *She fist pumped the air above her head, causing Dawn to nod her head in approval.*

Dawn: "For research!" *She shouted, fist punching above her head.*

Chrisma: *She smiled with boosted morale, groaning in excitement.* "Whoup whoup!"

*Joy and Lupton walked into the facility and noticed Chrisma.*

----------

Lance: *He walked down the stairs and stopped in the hallway, watching Alicia walk down the steps.* "Pepper.."

Alicia: "I know." *She spoke in recollection, smiling at Lance's reaction.*

Lance: *He smirked, shaking his head in disbelief.* "Wow, that's Angler for ya."

Alicia: *She skipped off the stairs and giggled, facing the exit.* "But you really should've seen what she looked like-"

Lance: *He firmly held Alicia's hand making sure she didn't trip over his feet, as she walked towards the door.* "Same old same old?"

Alicia: "No." *She shook her head, rocking their hands back and forth.* "Even before she transformed, she was already beautiful."

Lance: "Aye?" *He flicked his long brown hair out of his face, giving Alicia a strange look.*

Alicia: "S-Sorry?"

Lance: "Beautiful? She's like twelve, freak."

Alicia: "N-No, she looked like Teresa's age."

Lance: "You don't say?" *He mumbled and noticed the door ripple, causing him to stop.*

Lezard: *He hobbled into the castle and sarcastically gasped the moment he noticed Alicia and Lance.* "Why hello there, silly sausages!"

Alicia: "Lezard." *She smiled and bit her bottom lip, excited to see him.*

Lance: "'Sup?"

Lezard: "Why-?" *He held onto his cone-shaped hat with one hand and pointed to the ceiling with the other.* "The roof of course."

Lance: "Rightio-" *He rolled his eyes.*

Lezard: *He noticed Lance's hair, causing him to sarcastically hiss in disgust.* (It's suddenly long? Was that because of what happened in our fight with the Consultant?) "Ouchies! Hisssst."

Lance: "Huh?" *He looked at Lezard in confusion.*

Alicia: (Tee hee, Lance hasn't even noticed.)

Lance: "Wat is it now? Sausage eating puppies?"

Lezard: (Sausage eating puppies? Lezard might use that!) *He shook his head as if Lance was wrong.* "I'd like to say, you look better with shorter hair."

Lance: "Hair?" *He brushed his hand through his hair and grunted in shock, causing him to let go of Alicia's hand.* "Wat the-?" *He spoke under his breath, looking at his hair in confusion.*

Alicia: *She giggled at Lance and stepped closer towards him, looking at Lezard in a protective manner.* "I like it any way he wants."

Lance: "Aha, thanks, grottom bottom, but, I'll definitely be cuttin' this."

Alicia: "Whatever, you dirty butt biscuit."

Lance: *He chuckled, covering his mouth with his hand.* "Aha, wat?"

Alicia: "Tee hee, you heard me."

Lance: "Ahahahaha, ah hahaha." *He laughed hysterically, smiling at Alicia with warm welcoming eyes.*

Lezard: "Butt biscuit? I swear, children these days." *He shook his head in disappointment, adjusting the cone-shaped hat.*

Lance: "Ah wateva."

Lezard: *He coughed and stepped to the side, moving away from the door.* "I actually came here to see how you were, Lance."

Alicia: *She observed Lezard.* (His tone isn't sarcastic, he's serious.)

Lance: "Huh, why?"

Lezard: "Before you become the centre of attention, I wanted to personally thank you."

Lance: (The centre of attention?)

Lezard: (Those flames-) *He silently dropped to his knees and bowed.*

Lance: "W-Wat are you doing?" *He spoke in shock, quickly looking behind him in embarrassment.*

Alicia: (Why is he bowing to Lance?)

Lezard: "I witnessed the Remenistal you used to defeat the Consultant."

Lance: "Oh.." *He focused his attention back to Lezard, staring at him in a serious manner.*

Lezard: "Millard was my father."

Alicia: *She gasped as if she didn't know.* "Really?"

Lance: *He silently stared at Lezard as if he already knew.* (It wasn't like it was obvious or anythin'.)

Lezard: *He placed his hands on his knees, intensely staring at the floor in respect.* "Believe it or not, child.. I wasn't very popular."

Alicia: (Lezard..)

Lezard: "The only people I've ever looked up to, were my parents.. You, Lance.. Have my total gratitude."

Lance: *He paused, keeping his mature-like facial expression.* "Get up."

Lezard: *He looked up, emphasising his seriousness.* "I truly mean that."

Lance: *He noticed Lezard's emotional face, causing him to look surprised.* "W-Why?"

Lezard: "You've given me a personal closure."

Lance: "I think a lot of people have felt closure on his death, aye.."

Lezard: "No.. It felt like you did it for fath-, Millard."

Lance: "..."

Lezard: "Father monster.. He entrusted you with his power. He saw something in you, that he didn't see in many."

Lance: "..."

Alicia: *She noticed Lance's silence, causing her to nudge him.* "Lance?"

Lance: "I arh, err-" *He awkwardly mumbled, looking away in an uncomfortable-like manner.*

Lezard: "He used to believe, that the heat of his flames was determined by his drive to protect the people he cared about-" *He paused, looking back down with watering eyes.* "His-, your Phoenix Blaster was as hot as the sun."

Lance: *He smiled, as a tear ran down his face.* "..."

Lezard: "I'm probably not explaining myself properly, bwarhah-" *He chuckled, wiping his eyes.*

Alicia: (I wish I was there to help you, Lance.)

Lezard: *He stood up and looked down, brushing away the wrinkles in his robes.* "Even if the Consultant was defeated, nothing could have compared to being defeated by my father's own Grand Remenistal."

Lance: *He smiled with happiness and sadness.* "Yeah."

Lezard: *He sniffed, trying to recollect his composure.* "I took longer than I thought, I better leave you two to it. My guild members are in the emergency room as we speak."

Alicia: "W-Why?"

Lezard: "They confronted what Luna calls demon dick and was victorious against him."

Lance: (Him?)

Lezard: "Please excuse me." *He smiled at Lance in appreciation and stepped forward, hobbling past them down the hallway.*

Lance: *He looked over his shoulder and watched Lezard awkwardly hobble up each step.* (.. That was weird-)

Alicia: "Lance."

Lance: "Yea?" *He looked at Alicia, holding her hand.*

Alicia: *She wiped the tear from Lance's face, looking at him in confusion.* "What was with that reaction when he was thanking you?"

Lance: *He looked down to the polished floors and back up to the doors.* "Let's go, I want some fresh air." *He started to walk to the doors and gently tugged Alicia's hand, causing her to follow him.*

Alicia: "W-Well?"

Lance: "I've never been thanked like that before in my life." *He looked at Alicia with an emotionless, mature-like face before stepping through the doors.*

Alicia: *She stepped through the doors and sunlight shined outside the castle.* "Even if that was the case, why were you awkward about it?"

Lance: *He deeply inhaled the air and tightened his grip on Alicia's hand.* "I didn't know what to say."

Alicia: "Oh-"

Villager: *He whispered to a woman holding a basket of purple flowers and blatantly pointed at Lance.* "Is that him?"

Woman: *She silently stared at Lance and shook her head.* "No."

Villager: "Oh-"

Lance: *He stared at the man and woman, giving them a feral look in response.* "Man, pointin' at people is rude."

Alicia: *She giggled.* "Yep."

Lance: "Wat are you gigglin' at?"

Alicia: "..." *She let go of Lance's hand and skipped down the road-like path towards the entrance.*

Lance: "Or not?"

Alicia: *She looked to her side and noticed piles of rubble, caused by the damage of the enormous Darkwing.* (I hope everyone was fine during that attack-)

Lance: "Oi." *He chased after Alicia, causing her to ignore the rubble and run faster.* "When I say oi, it doesn't mean run faster!"

----------

Tyler: *He watched the area blur and swirl around him.* (I'm nearly home-) *He closed his eyes in thought, resting one arm over his RPG bag in thought.*

*A purple light flashed and winds blew in Tyler's face, causing him to slowly open his eyes.*

Tyler: *He looked down and felt his body, discreetly smiling in relief.* (Good-)

Season: "W-What?" *He whispered to himself in disbelief, catching Tyler's attention.*

Tyler: *He looked up and noticed Season staring at a large shadow.* (The sun, I can't see.)

Season: "I-? What-?"

Tyler: "Season?" *He sounded worried and quickly walked towards Season, ignoring the scorched pebbles on the ground.*

Season: "S-Surpreon...?"

Tyler: "Why haven't you gone inside yet-?" *He walked up to Season and noticed his face, causing him to quickly look in front.*

Season: "Th-This can't be, correct?"

Tyler: "Huh?" *He gasped with widening eyes and took a step back, covering his mouth with both hands.*

Season: *He slowly walked over the pieces of wood and rock, staring in front with a dropping jaw.* "I-It's gone..." *He placed his hand on Surpreon's outer layer and awkwardly leant forward, stepping through the crack in the wall.*

Tyler: *His eyes watered and he quickly ran towards Season.* "It's my fault, Season-" *He tripped over a piece of rock and fell onto the ground, causing his RPG bag to make the noise of bottles rattling against each other.*

Season: "My home.." *His voice sounded distorted, as he awkwardly stepped inside the city.*

Tyler: *He frowned and gritted his teeth, staring at a graze on his arm.* "Season-"

Season: "Th-This is un-..." *He spoke under his breath and shook his head, continuing to inspect the damage and ruins of the city.* "-Believable."

Tyler: *He listened to Season's faint gasps, causing him to quickly stand up.* (Season..)

*Tyler frowned in thought and ran forward in an urgent manner, awkwardly hopping over the debris.*

Tyler: *He reached up and jumped through the crack in the wall, causing the RPG bag to rattle.* "What does it look..-?" *He looked around and gasped, lowering his arms with growing sadness.* "Like..?"

Season: "My home.. Our home." *He slowly dragged his feet towards piles of charcoaled wood.*

Tyler: "Everyone.." *He sniffed and triggered images of the villagers saying hello to him, causing his eyes to water.*

Season: "Do you hear it?"

Tyler: *He silently watched Season stop in front of a clutter of debris.* "N-No?"

*The wind eerily howled through the cracks of the city, giving a sense of emptiness.*

Season: "All their voices." *He dropped to his knees and picked up a piece of wood, watching it crumble out of his grip.* "Can't you hear their screams?"

Tyler: *He pouted with quivering lips, trying to hide his guilt and sadness.* "I, umm." *He paused and looked down.*

Season: "The Consultant, how-? Why would he do something like this?" *He breathed slowly, trying to keep himself calm.*

Tyler: "I don't know."

Season: "All those innocent people." *He shook his head in disbelief.*

Tyler: *He slowly twirled around, staring at the city's wall.* (That's where the research facility used to be.)

Season: "I-I've failed."

Tyler: "What?" *He unintentionally gasped in disrespect, looking at Season.*

Season: "As a ruler, I've failed. I wasn't able to protect this city."

Tyler: "But-"

Season: "You know when Ridley mentioned destroying this city-" *He paused and sniffed.* "In the back of my mind, I thought he was just putting me off guard mentally."

Tyler: *He stared at Season's back, silently wiping tears off his face.* "You didn't fail-"

Season: "Tyler!"

Tyler: "H-Huh?" *He jumped in fright and gasped.*

Season: "I know you're trying to make me feel better, but in the end, I was not there for my people. They all died because of our involvement with the Consultant. Their deaths are pointless, it was meaningless!" *His voice deepened, as he held back the tears.*

Tyler: *He looked up and wiped away more tears.* (I hate this feeling-)

Season: "I'm not empathic like PKMY, but I can feel their pain." *He looked up and started to cry.*

Tyler: (I've seen Season at his worst.. But, this is horrible to see.)

Season: "A ruler never leaves his people.."

Tyler: "..."

Season: "As a ruler, you eventually learn that no matter how dark things seem to get, there is always someone to fight for, always someone to protect.."

*Season paused and whimpered in sadness, causing Tyler to hold his chest with emotional pain.*

Season: "Do you understand, Tyler, what a disgusting ruler I am?"

Tyler: "..."

Season: "This city was my life.. It was my drive, it was my honour, it was my pride!"

Tyler: *He stared at the ground, watching his tears drizzle around his feet.* "..."

Season: "A ruler makes sacrifices, and I was too bloody selfish."

Tyler: "B-But, fighting the Consultant wasn't selfish-"

Season: "Then explain to me what you're seeing now?!" *He shouted in sadness, causing Tyler to awkwardly pause.* "Allow me to tell you. It's the aftermath of someone pathetic."

Tyler: "Pathetic?" *He spoke in disgust, watching snot dripping out of his nose.*

Season: "Take another look around you.. Observe the damage, the failure... Garharharh.." *He cried in a wheeze-like manner, giving the illusion he made an awkward chuckle.*

Tyler: (These walls contained many memories-) *He sniffed and formed a fist, rubbing his eyes.*

Season: "As far as I'm concerned, I'm a disappointment to myself, and I disrespected all the previous rulers-"

Tyler: (I can't!-) *He breathed through gritted teeth, scrunching the RPG bag's flap with both hands.* "It's my fault."

Season: "Don't blame yourself-"

Tyler: "I-I told him about the city's shield-"

Season: "You, what?" *He slowly shuffled on his knees, facing Tyler with uncertainty.*

Tyler: "I-" *He opened his mouth and rubbed his eyes before wiping his nose in a child-like manner.* "I told him about the city's shield, if it wasn't for that, he might not have known how to-"

Season: *He looked at Tyler with sadness, as his tears sparkled in the sunlight.* "You.. Revealed the city's secret?"

----------

*PKMY and Teresa's image suddenly appeared inside the castle surrounded by a swirl of light, finding themselves in the hallway just outside the research facility.*

Teresa: *She glanced down the hallway and then to PKMY.* "We are here-"

PKMY: *She gasped and fell slightly back disorientated.* "You're flashstepping is crazy."

Teresa: "You get used to it."

PKMY: (I thought I already was-)

Teresa: "But that was no flashstep."

PKMY: "Eh?"

Teresa: *She smirked and walked into the research facility with pride.* "Has anyone seen Season?" *She spoke loudly and scanned across the room expecting a response.*

Dawn: "No yelling or running in the facility!" *She waved her hand above her head, focusing all her attention to several sheets of paper.*

Chrisma: *She turned around and noticed Teresa.* "Ah-"

Joy: "Terra." *She smiled and slightly bowed in respect.*

Teresa: "Have you seen Season?"

Lupton: "Yeah, they both went to Surpreon."

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She turned around and watched PKMY stagger in the facility with gritted teeth.*

PKMY: *She rubbed her face and looked up to Teresa.* "Is he here?"

Teresa: "They have already left."

PKMY: (They've already left..) *She grunted in thought as if she was analysing the situation.*

Joy: "The glyph is still active-" *She took several steps to the side and revealed dark purple lines on the ground.*

PKMY: "Heh." *She stared at the glyph and smirked.* "All it needs is Neurons and we're good to go."

Teresa: "Precisely."

Chrisma: "Ah? Could I come?"

Teresa: "No." *She walked past Lupton, Joy and Chrisma, towards the lines on the ground.*

Chrisma: "Oh bless.."

PKMY: "Ya need some help?"

Teresa: "Negative." *She flicked her hair and pointed towards the lines, causing them to glow purple.* "It is ready."

PKMY: "Already?"

Teresa: *She looked over her shoulder to PKMY and silently walked on top of the glyph.* "Indeed." *Her voice echoed before disappearing in a flash of purple light.*

Joy: (Terra seems different?) *She pondered to herself in a curious manner.*

PKMY: "Heh." *She smirked and stormed up to the glowing glyph.* "Ask her yourself." *She grunted to Joy, before disappearing in a flash of purple light.*

Joy: "Oh my?" *She looked startled as if she wasn't expecting PKMY to respond to her thoughts.*

Dawn: *She glanced at the glyph, quickly fist punching the air.* "For-"

Chrisma and Dawn: "Research!"

Chrisma: "Whoup whoup."

*Lupton and Joy glanced at Chrisma, face palming with mature expressions on their faces.*

----------

*Thick trees swayed above Holland, Blake, Cameron and Nathan, as they continued to search for Darkwings.*

Blake: "I'm getting tired, hey." *He whined in a feminine manner.*

Nathan: "Suck it up." *He swayed the sword on his side, tapping his leg with it in boredom.*

Blake: "Watevs."

Cameron: "Heh." *He smirked to himself as his armour rattled with each foot step.*

Holland: (Freya, do you feel anything?)

Freya: (No.) *Her voice echoed in his mind.*

Nathan: *He glanced over his shoulder at Blake.* "How much further until we find this Spacial Funnel?"

Blake: "I dunno." *He shrugged his shoulders.*

Nathan: *He frowned and grunted.* "Well, you're not much help."

Blake: "Well you weren't saying that when I summoned my sexy Anci-"

Nathan: *He sighed and nodded his head.* "Yeah, don't push it though."

Blake: "OK."

Cameron: (I should have got you to sweep from a bird's eye view.)

Apollo: (A little late for that?)

Cameron: *He smirked and folded his arms.* (Yes.)

Nathan: "Holland, what have you been doing with yourself, my old friend?"

Holland: *He looked at Nathan, watching him lead the party.* "Well if you hadn't noticed, I finally found a Scoldrant, whom I've connected with."

Nathan: "Oh yeah?" *His voice sounded as if he was smiling.*

Holland: "Her name's Freya."

Nathan: *He chuckled and placed the sword on the back of his neck, resting his hands on each end.* "That's great, I'm happy to hear that."

Holland: "What about you? You have the tribal markings, and the bloodline, have you found one?"

Nathan: "Nope." *He spoke in a carefree manner, causing Blake to smirk.*

Blake: (The shit we've been through, Nathan doesn't need no Scoldrant.)

Mio: (Oh?) *His deep, dragon-like voice echoed in Blake's mind.*

Blake: (But I sure do, without you, I'd just be sexy, not sexily amazing.)

Mio: (You're such a bother.)

Blake: (Watevs.) *He rolled his eyes, strutting by Cameron's side.*

Holland: "You sound pretty happy?"

Nathan: "I've got what I wanted."

Holland: "The sword?"

Nathan: "Of-"

Blake: "Memories." *He enthusiastically waved his arms around.* "Ever since he got back with that stupid sword, that's all he emphasises, aye."

Nathan: "Aye." *He smirked as if it was an inside joke.*

Blake: "Oh shut up." *He hissed in an annoyed manner.*

Holland: "Would you ever try and find your destined partner?"

Nathan: "One day." *He smiled and looked to the ground, watching sunlight dance on the dirt.* (Luna's Destiny could use a playmate-)

Holland: "So, who's the special lady?"

Nathan: *He looked up in confusion.* "Huh? What are you talking about?"

Holland: "You can't fool me, Nath." *He smirked, raising an eyebrow full of curiosity.*

Freya: (I can sense his attachment too.) *Her words caused Holland's smirk to widen.*

Blake: "Fufufu."

Cameron: *He half smirked and stared at Nathan, waiting for his response.* (Who is it?)

Blake: (C'mon, it's the scary blind chick.)

Holland: "Is she attractive?"

Freya: (Holland?!)

Holland: (Shh.)

Freya: (Grr-)

Cameron: (Oh? Luna Lighten if memory serves me right.)

Nathan: "Well, there's no one special, but I think Luna's really attractive."

Holland: "Luna?" *He sounded surprised.*

Blake: *He giggled and walked on a side, so he could see the whole party.* "Why do you care?" *He smirked at Holland as if he was expecting something interesting.*

Holland: "I think she's Lance's sister."

Nathan: "From what I've gathered, yeah."

Blake: "Anywho, what do you mean, really attractive?"

Nathan: "Huh?"

Blake: "You're like, her Scoldrant bitch."

Nathan: "Oh really?"

Blake: "Fufufu, stop denying it."

Nathan: "Hmph." *He smirked and kept his focus ahead, hiding his growing smile.*

Cameron: "Nonetheless, regarding your previous question, Holland." *He slightly looked over his shoulder and glanced at Holland, speaking towards him for respect.* "Attractive? Was that not slightly shallow?"

Nathan: *He smiled and nodded his head.* "Yeah, Holland."

Blake: "Yea, like-" *He looked up, twirling his fingers through his hair in a feminine manner.* "There's no point in having a sexy Scoldrant if it doesn't have any umph."

Holland: "Umph?"

Nathan: "Cameron, translation?"

Cameron: "He is implying, there is no point in having a flashy attack if it does not have the strength to back it up."

Nathan: (Still didn't make sense, but I get what he means now.)

Holland: "Jeez, gang up on me." *He scratched behind his head, mumbling with his deep voice.*

Blake: "So have you and Amy-" *He pointed with each hand, jabbing his fingers together in a childish manner.* "Are you together yet?"

Holland: "Umm, yeah, I think?"

Blake: (He thinks?)

Holland: (That reminds me.) *He looked down and smirked in recollection, triggering a flashback.*

--

Holland: "I've been thinking about this for some time. And-"

PKMY: *Her eye twitched with impatience as if she wanted to leave with the party.* "And?"

Holland: ".. I want us to grow old together."

PKMY: "H-Huh?" *She stepped away, facing Holland in shock.*

Holland: "Well, yeah. That's what I want."

PKMY: "I-"

Holland: *He noticed PKMY struggling to talk, causing him to smile.* "Let me know how you feel about it after we defeat the Consultant?"

PKMY: *She nodded her head in relief.* "Yea." *Her face became red.*

Holland: "Alright-"

Lance: "Oi, hurry up!-" *He walked with the party down a slope, shouting over his shoulder at PKMY and Holland.*

PKMY: *She formed a fist, looking past Holland.* "My name isn't oi!"

Lance: "Oi!" *He smiled and poked out his tongue, picking his nose.*

PKMY: "That's it!" *She cracked her knuckles and ran towards Lance.*

Lance: "Ah! Halp!" *He jogged past Lezard and Tyler, running in front of the party.*

PKMY: "Get back here!"

Lezard: "Bwarharh." *He chuckled, watching PKMY chase after Lance.*

Alicia: "Tee hee." *She kept focus on Lance, cupping her pendant with both hands.*

--

Nathan: "Amy?"

Holland: *He looked at Nathan, staring at his back with a smirk.* "I'll properly introduce you to her when we all meet up again."

Nathan: "Alright, I'll keep you on your word."

Blake: *He looked at Holland with curiosity.* "A Scoldrant User, aye."

Holland: "Ah? Yeah?" *He raised an eyebrow in confusion as if the answer should've been obvious.* "Didn't you figure that out back at The Twilight Forest?"

Blake: "Well, Nathan's markings are on the back of his shoulder. Mine's under my wrist. Cameron's is on his shoulder. Where's yours?"

Holland: "Ha ha, umm."

Blake: "Don't think umm is a body part." *He rolled his eyes.*

Holland: "Well, here-" *He lowered his hand.*

Blake: "Oh-"

Cameron: "Surely we would have encountered this Spacial Funnel by now, Blake?" *He spoke in a stern manner, quickly focusing the conversation back to their agenda.*

Blake: "Hmm, you're rite." *He nodded his head in agreement.*

Nathan: "Maybe the trees were lying?"

Blake: "Nah, they wouldn't."

Cameron: *He slowed down and stopped, causing the entire party to slow down.* "So what is the objective?"

Nathan: "I say continue walking."

Holland: "I want to find the Spacial Funnel."

Blake: "I'm getting tired, hey." *He whined and stood at an angle, slightly leaning on Cameron's shoulder.*

Nathan: "Then do what?"

Holland: "I dunno." *He shrugged his shoulder, scratching the facial hair around his cheek.*

Cameron: "We have been asked to help repair the damages done to the city."

Nathan: "And that could take time."

Blake: "I'm really tired from our big fight, aye."

Nathan: *He had flashbacks of an enormous dragon made of crystal and sand.* (It was the biggest fight I've ever had..)

Holland: "Well-" *He mumbled with uncertainty, causing Blake to frown.*

Blake: "Could someone make up their mind-?"

?????: "Skree." *A loud screech echoed in the distance in front of the party.*

Nathan: (Huh?) *He quickly looked in front, raising the sword.*

?????: "Skeree!"

Nathan: "Was I the only one that heard that-?" *He went to turn around, watching Blake, Cameron and Holland run past him towards the sound.*

Blake: "My bitch is sensing heaps of movement, hey."

Holland: "Freya agrees!"

Nathan: (That's right, they've got enhanced Scoldrant-like hearing-) *He lowered the sword and started to run after them, frowning in determination.*

----------

Tyler: *He stared at Season with glazing eyes.* "Season?"

Season: "..." *He silently ran his fingers through the charcoal on the ground.*

Tyler: "Season?" *He sniffed, waiting in suspense for Season's reaction.*

Season: "..." (My people, my home, my life-)

Tyler: "Season?!" *He stepped forward, trying to grab Season's attention.*

Season: "Please, leave me a-alone." *He mumbled and sniffed, noticing black smears on his arms from when his tears mixed with the charcoal.*

Tyler: *He leant back and sucked his lips in, trying not to cry.* "F-Fine." *His nose was red and puffy.* (Fine!) *He sniffed and turned around, running towards the crack he used to enter the city.*

----------

*Teresa and PKMY suddenly appeared in front of Surpreon in a flash of purple light.*

Teresa: "And here it is."

PKMY: *She slowly stepped forward in disbelief, covering her mouth in shock.* "H-How?"

Teresa: "I do not know."

PKMY: "Surpreon, it felt like a neighbour to my home."

Teresa: "Season is probably-"

Tyler: *He whimpered and struggled to step through the crack.* (I'm so ashamed-) *He jumped outside and sniffed, running towards the glyph with his eyes shut.*

*Tyler gritted his teeth and squealed with emotional fists, unknowingly running towards Teresa and PKMY.*

PKMY: "Tyler?"

Tyler: *He focused his attention on wiping his eyes, failing to notice their presence.* "My fault-"

Teresa: *She stepped forward, causing the scorched pebbles to crush under her foot, catching Tyler's attention.* "You are at fault in regards to what exactly?"

Tyler: *He gasped and stopped, facing PKMY and Teresa.* "N-Nothing."

PKMY: "Hmm?" (His nose is red and puffy, his aura is filled with guilt and grief-) "What happened?"

Tyler: "N-Nothing." *He sniffed and nervously brushed his RPG bag due to habit.*

Teresa: "If there is a foe that has hurt our friend, then I shall engage in combat."

PKMY: (Friend? Heh.)

Teresa: "Do not take my words lightly, Tyler. I am true to my words."

PKMY: *She stared at Tyler as if she was reading a book.* (I see-) *She stepped forward and flashstepped, causing the surrounding dirt to gently blow away.*

Tyler: *He chuckled in sadness and shook his head like a child.* "No, there are no foes, Teresa."

Teresa: "Then, explain the situation."

Tyler: "I-It doesn't matter." *He took several steps past Teresa, intending to step on the glyph.*

Teresa: *She grabbed Tyler by the shoulder and unintentionally cracked it, causing him to gasp in pain.* "It matters to me."

Tyler: "W-Well-" *He stepped back out of Teresa's grip and faced her with a sad filled face.*

PKMY: *She flashstepped behind Season and placed her hand on her waist.* "Seas-" *She took a few moments to observe the destruction of Surpreon.* (This, is horrible-)

Season: *He looked over his shoulder and slowly stood up.* "PKMY."

PKMY: "A-Ah-" *She coughed and looked at Season, ignoring the distracting ruins around her.* "What happened?"

Season: "Are you blind?"

PKMY: "About Tyler?"

Season: *He looked down and sighed.* "He-"

----------

*Lance and Alicia sat on the edge of the cliff outside the city, watching the waves crash against the land below.*

Lance: "So, where is Angler now?"

Alicia: "I don't know. She disappeared with Locki, Celest and Lorilei."

Lance: "Ah." *He grunted in understanding, ignoring his long hair which swayed in the wind.*

Alicia: "Lance."

Lance: "Yea, shit nugget?" *He smiled and looked at Alicia in the eyes, gently placing his hand on hers.*

Alicia: "Why do you call her Angler?"

Lance: "Hmm? Well, because of her hair."

Alicia: "I, don't get it." *She smiled awkwardly, slipping her fingers through Lance's.*

Lance: "You don't get a lot of things."

Alicia: *She frowned.* "Whatever, grottom bottom."

Lance: "Just be lucky you're beautiful."

Alicia: *She bit her bottom lip with a smile.* "S-So, what has her hair got to do with anything?"

Lance: "You know those angler fish with the lures 'n' stuff?"

Alicia: *She slowly shook her head.* "No?"

Lance: "Like, deep in the ocean, them fish with the glowin' lures? Angler fish?" *He grabbed a strand of his hair and swayed it in front, pretending it was a lure.* "Didn't I explain this ages ago?"

Alicia: "U-Umm.." *She looked confused, continuing to shake her head.*

Lance: "Well, that's where I got it from." *He looked away nervously and smiled at himself.*

Alicia: *She looked at Lance's hands and noticed his grey coloured fingernails.* (He must've given it his all to defeat the Consultant.)

Lance: *He slowly looked down and twiddled his fingers.* (They said my power would eventually drain away-)

Alicia: "Why did you do it?"

Lance: "Huh? Do what?"

Alicia: "Accept the offer to defeat the Consultant knowing what will happen."

Lance: "So you know?"

Alicia: "Y-Yep." *She looked down with a serious face.*

Lance: "If you know wat will happen, why ask the question?"

Alicia: "I want to know why? You always smiled when you looked at your lightning, sometimes even when you're fighting."

Lance: (I do?) *He slowly looked at Alicia in shock and let go of her hand, placing his hands in his lap.* "You noticed?" *He mumbled with flattery.*

Alicia: "Tee hee." *She giggled and looked away.*

Lance: *He sighed and looked up to the sky.* "Makin' me get all corny again, you're lame."

Alicia: "That's miss shit nuggets to you."

Lance: "Aha, well-" *He sighed again and looked at Alicia who stared at him in the eyes.* "The thought of dyin' and not seeing you again, it made my decision not even worth thinkin' about."

Alicia: (Wow-) *Her face instantly turned red and she gasped with laughter.* (My face is all red.)

Lance: "Happy now?" *He awkwardly smirked, as the wind blew his hair in his face.*

Alicia: "Yep." *She quickly leant forward, pecking Lance on the cheek in a nervous manner.*

Lance: (Cute.) *He smirked and looked at Alicia, as if he wanted to ask a question.* "Say?"

Alicia: "Y-Yes?

Lance: "Umm, you mind givin' me a haircut?"

Alicia: "Tee hee, sure." *She reached up, brushing Lance's hair out of his face.*

Lance: "Right, we'll go back to the city 'n' get some scissors."

Alicia: *She had a flashback of Pickles using ice-based weapons.* "No-" *She shook her head and cupped her hands, catching Lance's attention.*

Lance: "Wat are ya doin'?"

Alicia: "I can cut it with this-" *She applied pressure against her hands, causing a small ice-like dagger to extend out of her palm.*

Lance: "Nice." *He watched the ice sparkle, nodding his head in approval.*

Alicia: "Okay-" *She reached forward, causing Lance to lean back.*

Lance: "Whoa, settle down, tiger!"

Alicia: "Sorry?"

Lance: "I think we better stand for this."

Alicia: "Okay."

Lance: "Have you done this before?" *He stood up and reached down, gently helped her up.*

Alicia: "I used to cut the children's hair in my village all the time."

Lance: "Oh, the kids?"

Alicia: "Yep. So I guess that was perfect practice to cut yours."

Lance: "Oh, I keep forgettin' how hilarious you are."

Alicia: "Tee hee."

Lance: "You can be quiet and cut my hair now?"

Alicia: "How would you like it?"

Lance: "I dunno, just so it isn't longer than Docta Jingles."

Alicia: "Umm." *She inspected the back of his head.* (On the Sheridan, I liked his hair when it was long everywhere, so-) *She mentally prepared herself before grabbing a cluster of Lance's hair.*

Lance: "For my final words, I just wanted to thank my friends and family-"

Alicia: "Shh." *She slapped him on the shoulder, causing him to laugh and stop.*

Lance: "Alright." *He coughed away his smile and tried to be serious.*

Alicia: *She raised the dagger made of ice and flicked her wrist, causing strands of hair to blow away in the sea breeze.* "It cuts easy-"

Lance: "And I'm still alive-"

Alicia: "Shush you-" *She mumbled in concentration, grabbing another handful of hair.*

Lance: "Aha, sorry, beautiful."

----------

*Holland, Blake and Cameron urgently ran through the forest, closely followed by Nathan.*

Blake: (I don't fink I've said it, but your warnings have been amazing!)

Mio: (You do realise, I can sense what your feeling and thoughts.)

Blake: (Rite.)

Mio: (But.. You are welcome.) *His echoing words sounded hesitant.*

Blake: "Hmph." *He smirked while retaining his frown.*

Cameron: "I can feel a Spacial Funnel!" *He stared in front, running with his arms swaying behind his back.*

Blake: "Yea-"

Holland: *The purple ring around his iris spiralled, causing him to nod his head.* "I see it."

Mio: (There are Spacial Funnels and Reality Sekais that are sealed, be sure to unseal it-)

Blake: (I hear ya-) *He pointed his hand in front, causing the air to warp.*

Cameron: "Blake?"

Blake: "Just in case it was sealed, I've unsealed it."

Cameron: (Blake has one of the best abilities to connect with things, be it Scoldrant, trees or even Spacial Funnels.)

Apollo: (I know this.)

Cameron: *He smiled in response.* (Affirmative.)

Nathan: *He smirked and ran faster, causing him to run with the party.* "Alright, same plan as before."

Holland: *He glanced at Nathan as he flashstepped in line with the party.* "Two of us team up and fight from left to right?"

Blake: "Umm, it's right to left."

Cameron: "If the plan is effective, there is no need to change strategy."

Nathan: *He ignored the party's conversation and looked ahead, staring at the warping air in thought.* (I've got to be careful with these Spacial Funnels, I keep landing awkwardly by the way I jump through them-)

Cameron: "Left to right, right to left. It is the same thing." *He smirked and jumped forward into the Spacial Funnel.*

Blake: "Yea, wat he said." *He smirked at Cameron and jumped into the Spacial Funnel.*

Holland: "You ready?" *He shouted at Nathan and ran faster, smirking in excitement.*

Nathan: *He watched Holland fade and disappear in front of him.* "Always-" *His voice warped as he ran into the Spacial Funnel.*

----------

*Doves flew in a flock over a large magnificent castle which floated on an island above the clouds.*

*Locki, Celest, Lorilei and members of The Wise bowed in a line, inside a large cathedral-like room.*

Valkyrie: *She proudly walked into the room, causing everyone to lower their heads.* "Rise." *Her stern voice echoed, causing the party to slowly rise.*

The Wise: *A small elderly woman looked at the Valkyrie.* "Thou have summoned us for what reason, mistress?"

Valkyrie: "Repairs to the damage the man known as Ridley has caused."

Celest: "Damages?"

Valkyrie: "The Imperial Glacial Castle, Silver Wind Island and its royal castle. And Surpreon."

The Wise: *A tall old man looked at the Valkyrie in confusion.* "All with respect, mistress, but to help the peasants below?"

Valkyrie: "All spirits are of equal, that is all thy see."

The Wise: "Yes, thou're exactly right, mistress." *He looked away with respect.*

Valkyrie: "Thy will return shortly, but it is expected that repairs will be established."

Everyone: "Yes, mistress."

Valkyrie: "Excellent, my noble einherjar." *She spoke in respect and smiled with love as gold and silver strings spiralled out of her body.*

Pepper: "Karh-" *She stepped forward and panted in exhaustion.*

Celest: "Mistress?"

Pepper: "Mistress?" *She sounded confused and looked around in a puzzled manner.*

Locki: "Pepper."

Pepper: *She looked at Locki, confirming her identity.* "What happened?"

*Several members of The Wise looked at each other and nodded their heads, as if they already pre-discussed something.*

The Wise: "Pepper Captian."

Pepper: "Y-Yes?" *Sweat started to drip down her face.*

The Wise: "We owe thou a massive apology."

*Celest, Locki and Lorilei looked to their side, staring at The Wise in shock.*

Pepper: "I say, what about yeah?"

The Wise: "Punishing thou, when thou weren't at fault."

Locki: *He formed a fist, keeping his emotionless face.* "..."

The Wise: "We have discussed this beforehand, and, we humbly wish to ask of thou, to accept our apology?"

Pepper: "Yes."

Locki: "With all respect to The Wise, Pepper, thou should not so eagerly accept their apology."

Celest: (In a sense, I agree with Locki.)

Pepper: (If it wasn't for them, I wouldn't have had the opportunity to make friends with everyone.)

*Pepper smiled in thought and stepped forward, readying to answer The Wise.*

Pepper: "I-" *Her eyes rolled back and she fell forward, slipping into unconsciousness.*

Locki: *He stood up and flashstepped, allowing him to catch Pepper before she fell onto the floor.* "She's exhausted."

Lorilei: "Oh my-"

The Wise: "And, Lorilei Gales."

Lorilei: "Hmm?" *She sounded nervous as she avoided eye contact with each member of The Wise.*

The Wise: "Due to the Valkyrie's influence, we may need to revise our long-lived rules."

Celest: *She stood up and slowly walked towards Pepper and Locki while keeping eye contact with the old man speaking.* "What are thou saying?"

The Wise: "Perhaps rules may need to be updated to suit the needs of the current trend or generation."

Lorilei: "Oh dear, I still don't grasp what you're trying to say?" *She spoke in confusion with her high in tone voice.*

The Wise: "For the time being, until we fulfil the mistress' request, thou are free to walk on Valhalla soil once again."

Lorilei: *She smiled to herself.* (For a moment, I thought they were going to banish me again or send me back to that prison-)

Celest: *She smiled, glancing at Lorilei in the corner of her eye.* (How curious! The Wise has never admitted to changing the rules before!)

Locki: (She's back to her normal age in appearance.) *He admired Pepper's armour and face.*

The Wise: "The mistress awakened when Pepper lost her life, has it been confirmed if she was somehow resurrected or if she has received a Sacred Knight's secondary chance?"

The Wise: "Resurrection isn't possible!" *She gasped in disbelief.*

The Wise: "This is our mistress we're talking about! Surely such a miracle isn't out of her reach."

Celest: "With respect, does it matter if she has or hasn't? She still breathes the air, her heart beats, her Neurons burn and Astragons flow-"

The Wise: "It would be wise to know in case she was to ever lose her life."

Celest: *She looked displeased but hesitantly nodded her head.* "Thy will check the mistress' memories to confirm."

Locki: *He discreetly rubbed Pepper's cheek with his fingers and smiled.* "Thy would like to move Pepper to an appropriate area for a swift recovery."

The Wise: "That is fine, dismissed."

Locki: "Thy would like to offer my appreciation." *He looked at Celest.* "Thy will be back momentarily."

Celest: "Indeed, take her somewhere safe."

Locki: "Definitely." *He smiled with seriousness and disappeared in a flash of white light.*

Celest: *She turned around and faced Lorilei.* "Lorilei, thy'll need assistance in preparations to repair The Imperial Glacial Castle."

Lorilei: "Of course."

The Wise: "We shall begin preparations ourselves."

Lorilei: "Understood-" *She watched each member of The Wise place hoods over their heads, before flashstepping out of the room.*

Celest: "This way." *She motioned her head and walked away, causing her footsteps to echo throughout the room.*

----------

PKMY: *She looked at Season annoyed.* "We both know Tyler, are you seriously blaming him?"

Season: "I don't know what to think!" *He grunted with sadness and frustration, as tears ran down his face.*

PKMY: "If you don't know what to think, then tell me, what's going through your mind?" *She leant on her side and impatiently tapped her foot.*

Season: "It's not like you can't tell?"

PKMY: "I want you to say it out loud."

Season: "My home is destroyed, that's all I can say for now."

PKMY: "How do you think Tyler feels?"

Season: "He told Ridley the barrier, I don't see why he would do that."

PKMY: (I haven't checked Tyler's memories, so I can't say for sure-) "Are you telling me Tyler wanted to betray you?"

Season: "I-I don't know."

PKMY: "Did he explain it to you?"

Season: "No-" *He sniffed and gritted his teeth.* "I don't need a lecture from my younger sister!"

PKMY: "Huh?"

Season: "You-"

Teresa: "Although, I may not be older or more experienced in terms of emotion, Caesar, but is this not childish?" *She spoke with an emotionless face, stepping through the crack with Tyler by her side.*

Season: "I-"

PKMY: "It's clear you're clouded with emotions, this isn't you talking right now." *She glanced over to Tyler, watching him stare at the ruins around him in sadness.* "Teresa-"

Teresa: (I understand-) *She grabbed Tyler's elbow and their image disappeared, causing a pulse of charcoal to sway along the ground.*

Season: "What am I meant to do?"

PKMY: "Tssk-" *She looked past Season and watched Teresa and Tyler's image appear behind him.* "Didn't you always tell me there are two sides of every story?"

Season: "Probably-"

PKMY: *She stormed up to Season and leant forward, frowning in his face.* "I can feel great sadness coming from you."

Season: "..." (You don't need an ability to know that.)

PKMY: "Tssk." *She discreetly grunted in an annoyed manner, as if she heard Season.*

Teresa: *She looked at Season's back, staring at the glimpses of PKMY's red hair.* (Where is she going with this?)

PKMY: "But-" *She looked past Season and to Tyler.* "I can feel the same sadness from him."

Season: "Who-?"

PKMY: *She closed her eyes and reached forward, placing her hand on Season's shoulder.* (Listen.) *Her voice echoed in Season's mind, causing him to stop.*

Season: (Listen to what-?)

Tyler: (I'm horrible, I'm terrible, he's home, their home, my home, our home-) *He thought to himself in anguish, as he stared into space with an emotionless face.* "C-Can I go-?"

Teresa: *She quickly grabbed Tyler's shoulder, causing him to stop in mid-sentence.* "Do not underestimate an empathic's ability to understand the situation."

Tyler: "..." *He looked down with a twitching eye, due to stress and frustration.* (If only I had known Riddle-, I mean Ridley was the bad guy, I would have never decided to help him.. I only helped him because Season liked him!)

Season: *He closed his eyes and concentrated, as if he was listening to a phone call.* (Tyler's voice or thoughts, are echoing into my head-)

Tyler: (Season, my role model. How could he forgive me? How can I forgive myself-?)

Season: "I've heard enough." *He opened his eyes and stood up straight.*

PKMY: "You've heard enough?"

Tyler: *He looked up in confusion, staring at Season with puffy red eyes.* (They didn't say anything.)

Season: "I see what you're doing, Amy."

PKMY: "Eh?" *She tilted her head in confusion, pretending to play innocent.*

----------

Blake: *He stepped through the Spacial Funnel and found himself in a large village with several straw-made huts.* (Here?)

Cameron: "Did we enter the wrong Spacial Funnel?"

Blake: "Nah, Mio picked stuff up in here too."

Holland: *He stepped forward, standing next to Blake while observing the village.* (This looks similar to the village of Rostical Users.)

Nathan: *He lowered the sword, looking to each side.* "There's something about this village.."

Blake: "This feeling, it's familiar."

Mio: (Yes.. Those bothersome people..)

Blake: (Don't worry, bitch..)

Mio: (Hermm?)

Blake: (Together, words won't hurt us, hey.)

Mio: (Herumph.) *He chuckled in a deep, dragon-like voice.* (I have never been worried about you mortals.)

Blake: (Fufufu, watevs.)

Nathan: (Blake's right, this village does look familiar-) *Realisation flooded his face.* (Here!-)

Holland: *He looked at Blake, raising an eyebrow in curiosity.* "Reminds you of what?"

Nathan: *He nudged Holland with a nostalgic smile.* "Home."

Holland: *His eyes widened and he took another glance at the village, causing him to smile.* "What's our village doing all the way over here?"

Nathan: (I'm surprised, too. I wonder why our home is here.)

Cameron: *He reached over his shoulder, causing his blue sword to turn invisible.* "How curious."

Blake: "Babe?"

Cameron: "Before I joined the ranks of the warriors-" *He took a step forward, causing his armour to rattle.* "Even before I was put in training to be number one-"

Blake: "Oh, here we go, aye." *He rolled his eyes at Cameron, pretending to yawn in a bored manner.*

Cameron: "Oh?"

Blake: "Fufufu, just joking! Tell us more about what happened in ancient times."

Cameron: *He hid his smile, keeping his professional composure.* "I do recall the elders being able to communicate to Spacial Funnels and Reality Sekais."

Blake: "Like me?"

Cameron: *He nodded his head.* "This ability allowed them to transport the entire village itself."

Nathan: (I vaguely remember the village moving, but with what Cameron just said.. I never knew Scoldrant Users could reach that far with their Soul Links.)

Nathan: "This is our home.. So.."

Blake: "Where is everyone?" *He scanned across the village, hissing in a curious manner.*

Nathan: *He nodded his head, glancing at each party member.* "Can't any of you three sense-?"

Mio: (Blake!)
Apollo: (Cameron!)

?????: "Skree."

Holland: *He quickly looked towards the screech, causing the purple ring to instinctively spiral around his iris.* "That was-"

Nathan: "Let's get it."

Blake: "I know rite." *He hissed in determination, causing the party to run towards the screech.*

Cameron: (Location?)

Apollo: (Towards the hut to the left!-)

Cameron: *He ran at incredible speeds around a large hut, instantly noticing an old man.* (Huh?)

Apollo: (Cameron!)

Cameron: (I see them!) *He noticed the old man standing in front of fifty villagers and Scoldrants, spreading his arms in a protective manner.*

Blake: *He ran next to Cameron and stopped, looking towards the man in shock.* "Wha-?"

Mio: (It's him!)

Blake: (The villagers, they're all on the ground except for-)

Nathan: *He flashstepped next to Blake and noticed the old man, ignoring a swirl of straw and dirt which pulsed around his feet.* (Keno!)

Holland: *He jogged around the hut and noticed the party members staring in front of them in shock.* "What's happening?"

Keno: *He looked behind him at the tribe members, staring at them in a serious manner.* (This isn't good, these creatures took down our best Scoldrant Users in several attacks.)

Man: *He moaned with a fish-like Scoldrant by his side.* "S-Sorry, elder-"

Keno: "I-It is fine." *He grunted and looked back in front with a worried expression.*

Holland: "Keno!" *He ran towards Keno, catching the entire tribe's attention.*

Blake: "C'mon." *He hissed at Nathan and Cameron and ran up to Holland.*

Female: *She covered one eye which was red due to blood.* "N-Narh?"

Keno: (Holland, Blake, Nathan and Cameron.) *He thought to himself in surprise.*

Female: *She looked at the party and quickly observed each member, noticing the lack of Scoldrants by their side in shock.* "Only Scoldrant Users can enter-" *She coughed and sighed, slowly falling unconscious.*

Blake: (They've been attacked.)

Cameron: (Their condition supports that those entities were recently in this Spacial Funnel.)

Apollo: (Those entities called Darkwings.)

Blake: *He glanced at Cameron.* (Cam, there's no signs of them unsexy creatures.)

Cameron: (It is plausible that these Scoldrant Users defeated them-)

Man: *He leant against a beast of long white fur and stared at the party, growling in realisation.* "It's the losers-"

Blake: "Tssk-" *He glanced at the man in the corner of his eye.*

Mio: (I will tear out his eyes from their sockets!)

Man: *He looked at Holland, spitting blood out from his mouth in disgust.* "The people who can't even Soul Link with our fellow cousins-" *He glanced at Nathan, shaking his head in disappointment.* "The people who throw our tribal ways in our face."

Nathan: (Really?) *He slightly smirked in response.*

Man: *He glanced at Blake, causing the beast behind him to chuckle in a condescending manner.* "The embarrassment of the tribe-"

Mio: (Embarrassment?)

Blake: "Tssk." *He frowned and gritted his teeth, forming fists by his side.*

Man: "And-" *He looked at Cameron and stopped, as if he had nothing mean to say.* "Cameron?"

Old Lady: "Them? How dare they show their faces-" *She wheezed and struggled to breathe, disgusted by the party's presence.*

Holland: (They're all wounded.)

Nathan: (From everything I've been through, I don't seem to care for name-calling.) *He ignored the villagers, glancing at Keno in a mature manner.* "What happened here?"

Keno: "These creatures with bones and shadow." *He paused, looking to each side in a wary manner.*

Blake: "Why are ya looking around? They're not here?"

Keno: "They're able to freely enter and exit the Spacial Funnel without the use of the portal."

Holland: (When could they do that?)

Freya: (They didn't show any of those abilities before?)

Holland: *He frowned in thought.* (Or at least, they never used it in front of us.)

Cameron: "Then we will defeat them."

Apollo: (I agree!)

Keno: "Perhaps-"

Teenage Boy: "No way! I remember those losers anywhere. They can't do squat." *He rudely pointed at the party, despite his bleeding wounds.*

Girl: "Yeah!"
Old Man: "I agree, they have no power-"

Blake: "Totes unsexy." *He folded his arms and looked away.*

Old Man: "Or the right to be here!" *He held his bloody arm in pain, causing a large fish-giraffe-like Scoldrant to lick his wounds.*

Keno: "As the tribe leader, I will take care of the matter-" *He closed his eyes.* (Kosmo!)

Man: "Elder, you shouldn't. Those creatures already tore apart all of your summonses!"

Holland: (The Darkwings tore all of Keno's summons?)

Freya: (I don't know about you, Holland. But I'm getting the vibe these Darkwings may be different from the ones we fought before.)

Keno: *He sighed in fear, trying to ignore the wounded villagers behind him.* "Kosmo, help me out!" *He yelled with a frail voice.*

Cameron: "Can he do it?"

Blake: "I've seen Keno fight, he should have no problems aye-"

Darkwing: *It warped in front of Keno, suddenly stabbing him in the stomach with its bone shard-like arm.* "Sk-k-kree."

Nathan: *His eyes widened in disbelief.* "How-?!"
Holland: "Keno!"
Cameron: "There it is!"

Blake: *He looked up, hissing in surprise.* (It's big!-)

Mio: (It doesn't matter! Don't show such weakness after being disrespected like that again!)

Blake: (Rite, bitch.) *He frowned to himself in acknowledgement, quickly hiding his surprise.*

Darkwing: "Skarh?" *It looked at Holland, Cameron, Blake and Nathan in shock, causing it to casually fade away.*

Freya: (I can't sense its movement! It's like it has the ability to freely slip through Astragons!)

Keno: *He wheezed and coughed out blood, dropping to the ground.* "B-Blast-"

Nathan: *He noticed Blake and Holland readying themselves to run to Keno's aid.* "Don't!" *He took a step forward, quickly putting his hands in front of them.*

Holland: "What are you doing, bro?"

Blake: "Oi, bitch?" *He waved at Keno implying that he should help him.*

Nathan: "We'll take down the creatures first."

Holland: "But Keno-"

Cameron: "I concur with Nathan. It is wise to take the creature down."

Nathan: "Thanks."

Cameron: *He nodded his head in response, glancing at Keno in a professional manner.* "Despite the Darkwing's ability to fade in and out of the Spacial Funnel, how exactly did the entire village-?"

Keno: "There was over a hundred, they merged and became four-" *He coughed and gargled.*

Cameron: (I see.)

Apollo: (So they merged like they did at Silver Wind Island.)

Cameron: "Then we can not give them the opportunity to merge furthermore!"

Apollo: (Sqcork!) *He squawked in agreement, echoing in Cameron's mind.*

Nathan: *He raised the sword and looked around.* "Looks like we'll have to fight."

Blake: "Yea.. I'm not worried, hey."

Nathan: "You should be. These seem to be on a different level to the ones we fought back in Silver Wind Island."

Blake: "Fufufu, I've got my good friend and my soul mate with me, hey."

Mio: (Excuse me?)

Blake: "And the strongest and sexiest Ancioldrant."

Nathan: *He suddenly smirked.* "Damn right!"

Holland: "Four?"

Cameron: "One each obviously."

Blake: "Yep."

Apollo: (Summon me!)

Cameron: (Understood-) *He placed his hand on his shoulder, causing spirals of purple glyphs to swirl around his hand.*

Mio: (It is time to show these disrespectful mortals what we can do!)

Blake: (This knowledge-?)

Mio: (Using the tribal markings, it is the easiest and quickest way to access each of our powers!)

Blake: (Ya couldn't, like, tell me this before?)

Mio: (With what opportunity? You were such a bother and did not allow your body to rest when we were becoming one!)

Blake: (My bad.) *He placed his hand under his left wrist, causing spirals of purple glyphs to rotate around his arm.*

Freya: (Holland!)

Holland: *He placed a hand on his tribal markings and the other on his chest, causing a purple glyph to expand and spiral in front of him.* "I'm ready."

Blake: "I can sense 'em."

Cameron: "Me too."

Holland: "Same here." *He grunted in a deep voice, slightly smirking with anticipation.*

Nathan: (I can't sense like them, but I can pick up the slightest of movement.) *He glanced around and swayed the sword in concentration, causing it to make a holy surreal-like sound.*

Keno: (I leave the rest to you-)

Man: "This is hopeless-"

Old Woman: *She nodded her head in agreement, glaring at the party members.* "We'll die while being laughed upon by our weakest-"

Holland: "Freya!"
Cameron: "Apollo."
Blake: "Lend me your strength!-" *He bent down and dragon-like wings burst out of his back and his skin started to scale.*

Mio: (Take it!)

Blake: (The power of an Ancioldrant-) *He smirked as his scales became glossy and his eyes changed to that of a dragon's.*

Old Woman: "His appearance?"
Man: "Holland found his Soul Link?"

Nathan: *He looked to the side and smirked.* "Sword of Memories!" *His image disappeared and he reappeared in the air, causing several villagers to gasp.*

Teenage Boy: "He can flashstep like a captain?" *He squealed in shock, causing purple rings to spiral around his iris, heightening his vision.*

Nathan: "Humph!" *He sliced the air and multicoloured sparks scattered off a Darkwing, which warped into his slash.*

Teenage Boy: "He attacked the creature before it even made its presence known?!"

Freya: *She pounced out of the glyph and landed on all fours.* "Grr."

Holland: "Get straight to it! Ougi, Ancioldrant Freya."

Freya: (Already?)

Holland: (They're invisible!)

Freya: *Her wings dropped off and flames scorched out of her back, acting as replacements.* "Grarh!" *Her loud thunder-like roar sent shivers across nearby Scoldrants.*

Keno: *He watched a blue pig-like Scoldrant squeal in fear due to Freya's presence.* (Impossible?!)

Apollo: *He dived out of the glyph and spiralled high into the air like a torpedo.* (Ready when you are!)

Cameron: (Great, patience is the key-) *He calmly looked to each side in a professional manner.*

Blake: *His vision was blue and green.* (Having different dimensional vision can be handy-) *He smirked and blinked, causing his vision to become purple.* (I can see heat signatures, movement in the air, and-)

Mio: (There!)

Blake: *He ran on all fours and jumped in the air, flapping his wings which increased his flying speed.* "-Fluctuations in the Astragons!"

Darkwing: "Skr-" *It warped into the village and Blake tackled it onto the ground, causing its ribs to instantly shatter.*

Blake: *He squinted his eyes with a smirk as strings of dust from his bursting ribs swayed past his face.* "Fufufu!"

Cameron: *He froze momentarily and quickly spun around.* "There!" *He pointed into the air, causing Apollo to instantly alter his flying direction.*

Apollo: "Sqcork." (Got it. Screaming Gale.) *He flapped his wings in the direction Cameron pointed towards and a gust of silver wind blew downwards.*

Darkwing: *It appeared in vacant space in front of Cameron.* "Skree-" *The silver wind blew its shadow and surrounding dirt back.*

Cameron: *He reached behind his back and sparks scattered around his blue sword.* "Hmph-" *He flashstepped directly in front of the Darkwing.*

Darkwing: *It noticed Cameron, causing it to raise its arm in reaction.* "Sk-?" *Its shoulders twitched, struggling to move its arm.*

Cameron: "Is the wind's resistance too great for you?" *He held the sword with both hands and sliced it downwards, slicing off the Darkwing's arm.* (Apollo, step it up!)

Apollo: (Feather Buster.) *He flapped downwards and dagger-like feathers jabbed into the ground and into the Darkwing.*

Cameron: *He sidestepped and avoided the feathers as small bursts of bones cracked in the Darkwing's chest.* "Humph." *He smirked and flicked the sword behind him, causing blue sparks to scatter from a feather.*

Apollo: (Sorry!)

Cameron: (It is fine-) *He raised the sword, which glowed green and the symbols glowed blue.*

Man: "W-What's happening? They're fighting these things on an even level!"

Keno: (I momentarily let my pride get in the way of my decision making.. I should have known better how amazing these individuals have become.)

Cameron: "AQUA LIQUID" *He waved the sword across as a swirl of water stringed around the sword, taking shape of a serpent.*

Old Man: (I knew Cameron was amazing, but, being able to use Rostical while simultaneously using his Scoldrant while keeping focus with his swordplay!-)

Darkwing: "Skrarh-" *The ground cracked and ripped up behind it in the powerful gust of wind.*

Apollo: "CYCLONIC WINDS" *He flapped downwards, causing a constant gust of wind to immobilise the Darkwing.*

Old Man: *He gasped with a dropping jaw.* (And a Rostical Using Scoldrant!)
Darkwing: "Skree!" *Its screech sounded distorted due to Apollo's wind.*

Cameron: "Die." *He flicked the sword and the serpent spiralled around the Darkwing.*

Darkwing: *It opened its jaw and aimed a spear-like bone at Cameron, ignoring the water surrounding it.* "Sk-"

*Cameron tilted the sword and the water suddenly crashed around the Darkwing, exploding its body.*

Darkwing: "Skerarh-" *Its screeched echoed over the sounds of breaking bones and rumbling water.*

Cameron: "Hmph." *He smiled, watching the bones crumble to dust followed by a shower of water.*

Old Man: (That was so quick!) *He thought with widening eyes.*
Cameron: "Easy-" *He spoke in a confident manner and turned around, watching Blake attack the Darkwing.*

Blake: *He looked at his hands and scrunched his fingers, causing green, fluoro dragon-like claws to extend over his polished nails.* "Fufufu-"

Darkwing: *It sliced its arm across Blake.* "Skree!-"

Blake: "Too slow! Scorching Claws." *He lunged forward and straightened his fingers, violently jabbing them through the Darkwing's shoulder.*

Darkwing: "Sk-"

Blake: *He ripped its arm off and slashed its chest, slicing off all of its ribs.* "You had no chance, bitches."

Man: "That embarrassment is slicing its bones like butter!"
Darkwing: "Skree-" *Its skull cracked and changed shape into a bow, aiming it in Blake's face.*

Blake: "Dragonised Hammer." *He chuckled and rammed his hand through the Darkwing's head, causing its body to suddenly puff into dust in spirals of green flames.* "Fufu, didn't even hafta use my Ougi."

Mio: (Fufufufu.) *He chuckled with his deep voice, causing Blake's dragon-like eyes to momentarily flash with power.*

Nathan: *He landed on one foot and flicked his sword up, slicing off the Darkwing's arms and legs with a sway of rainbow coloured sparks.* "You don't stand a chance."

Man: *He watched from the middle of the villagers.* (He didn't even make contact with the creature and its limbs still sliced off?!)

Nathan: (To think, I learnt battle techniques from our little Karol-) *He grunted and suddenly spun around on his one foot, slicing the air around him.* "Harh!"

Blake: *He looked at Nathan with an altered visual perspective, watching the wind sway green around his body.* (If I had your eyes before fighting Nath, maybe I could've defeated him in several shots.)

Mio: (Why not now?)

Blake: "Fufu." ('Cause he's one of my bitches now.)

Mio: (Bothersome..) *He chuckled in a condescending manner.*

Darkwing: "Skra-" *It watched its ribs shatter off its body from invisible air slashes, noticing flashes of rainbow coloured sparks swirl around its bones.*

Blake: (It doesn't have any legs or arms, we've almost finished this, aye.) *He spoke with a sigh and placed one hand on his waist.*

Nathan: *He faced the Darkwing, flashstepping directly in front of its face.* "Umph."

Darkwing: *Its body quickly warped and faded, causing Nathan's sword to slice the air where its head was.* "Skreee." *Its screech echoed around Nathan.*

Nathan: "Hmm-" *He skilfully landed on the ground and quickly raised the sword, listening to its echoing screech.* "Just missed?"

Darkwing: "Skrah!" *It appeared behind Nathan and leant forward, jabbing its arm through his back.*

Nathan: *He looked down in shock, noticing the Darkwing's skeletal fingers twiddle in his chest.* "A-Ah-"

Keno: (No! Nathan!)

Cameron: *He watched from a distance and stared at the Darkwing behind Nathan, noticing its new form.* (It regenerated its legs and arms fairly quickly-)

Darkwing: *It ripped its arm out and noticed its fingers, looking at them in a curious manner.* "Sk?"

Blake: *He watched Nathan smirk, causing him to look confused.* (Why is he-?)

Mio: (Check the Darkwing's claws.)

Blake: *He glanced at the Darkwing's fingers.* (There's no blood.)

Nathan: "Harh!-" *He spun around and sliced the Darkwing's hand off.*

Darkwing: "Skr-?!"

Nathan: *His image appeared in the air behind the Darkwing.* "..."

Keno: (What-!?) *He thought with widening eyes.*

Blake: (It hasn't even noticed the copy behind it-)

Darkwing: *It stared at Nathan in front of it and raised its other arm, readying to attack.* "Skree!"

Nathan: *He firmly held the sword behind him and he slashed across the back of the Darkwing's neck, causing its body to suddenly puff into dust.* "Harh!"

Cameron: "Two copies!" *He mumbled to himself with a dropping jaw.* (Like Teresa-)

Nathan: "That's what I'm talking about-" *He looked down at his other image through the dust and noticed a hole in his shirt left by the Darkwing, watching his image fade away.*

Holland: *He frowned at the Darkwing as it slashed the air across Freya.* (Keep dodging-)

Freya: *She ducked and jumped over its arms.* (Its nails are sharp, I can hear it screeching through the air-)

Holland: (Don't think about that, you're doing great!)

Nathan: *He landed on the ground and placed the sword over his back, causing it to vanish.* (Holland's the last to defeat his one, I don't know if I should help him out yet.)

Holland: "It's all yours."

Freya: *She jumped to the side and quickly jumped to the other side, avoiding the Darkwing's strikes.* "Sonic Roar." *She roared out a visible sound wave, blowing off the Darkwing's arm.*

Holland: *He quickly stepped to the side, as an arm of bone flew past him.* (Great.)

Apollo: (She spoke?) *He flapped his wings, watching from a bird's eye view.*

Nathan: (Ha, what am I saying? He doesn't need my help.)

Freya: "Gargling Whirlpool." *She raised her snout, as water splashed from the sides of her jaw.*

Darkwing: *Its skull cracked and instantly took shape of a bow, shooting out a skeletal arrow at Freya.* "Skree-"

Holland: (Ignore the water, avoid the bone!-)

Freya: *She barked a vortex of water above her.* "Grarh-, Flash Hound." *She flashstepped up into the air above the vortex of water.*

Holland: *He watched the skeletal arrow shoot through the air where Freya stood and jam itself into a hut, exploding it into an eruption of straw.* (That was close!-)

Freya: "Ice Fang." *She opened her jaw and two blue fluoro ragged beams extended from her teeth, biting into the vortex of water underneath her.*

Holland: *He watched the beams merge with the water, freezing it.* (Huh?)

*The freezing water swirled into two thickening streams of ice, causing Holland to smirk in amazement.*

Holland: (Nice.)

Cameron: *He watched a vortex of ice spiral down towards the Darkwing.* (A combination of three Scoldrant-based Azure Bursts.)

Darkwing: *It looked up and stared at the vortex of ice, shooting another skeletal arrow towards it.* "Skree." *It watched the ice shatter around the bone, causing it to screech in excitement.*

Freya: *She listened to the sounds of glass shattering, watching the skeletal arrow sway around the ice.* (It destroyed my ice, as I hoped-)

Cameron: (Its projectile wasn't strong enough to pierce the ice and Freya-)

Darkwing: "Skrarh!" *It instantly shot out another skeletal arrow, directly towards Freya.*

Freya: "Aerial Pounce." *Her image disappeared, causing the arrow to pierce through the air and into the distance.*

Apollo: (That was another close call.)

Cameron: (Yes. If she had not mastered that Azure Burst, she would have got stabbed-)

Freya: "Grarh!" *She suddenly appeared in the air next to the Darkwing with her legs tucked in.* "Grr." *She extended her legs and smashed the Darkwing's shoulder.*

Darkwing: *A pulse of bones, shadow and dust scattered past it, due to the force of Freya's attack.* "Sk-"

Freya: "Flash Hound." *She flashstepped and reappeared behind the Darkwing, spinning in circles along the ground.*

Darkwing: "Skrr-" *Its legs suddenly blew off and blasted past the tribe members, causing them to stare at the legs in shock.*

Holland: (Wow-) *He smiled proudly as ice spears rained down on the Darkwing.*

Darkwing: *It screeched with disorientation.* "Sk-"

Freya: "Sonic Roar." *She quickly focused her aim and roared out a visible shockwave, exploding the Darkwing's head.*

Blake: *He sighed and started to walk towards Holland.* "Took your time, ya big show off."

Freya: *She watched the Darkwing puff into dust.* (Is that all of them?) *She looked around and gargled, dribbling out strings of fire.*

Cameron: (Holland and Freya played that entire fight with a complete consecutive chain of attacks.)

Apollo: (It was quite a combo-) "Sqcork!"

Keno: *He intensely stared at Blake, Nathan, Cameron and Holland.* (They defeated all four!-)

Holland: "That's all, great work, Freya."

Freya: (Great!-) *She trotted towards Holland and Blake.*

Blake: "The ice spears, was that intentional? 'Cause, like, the Darkwing shattered your ice."

Freya: "Ruff!" (Yes, it was intentional.)

Blake: "Then what if it didn't shatter the ice to create the spears?"

Freya: (Then the swirl of ice would've crashed on top of it.) *She wagged her tail with excitement.*

Blake: "Nice strategy, hey." *He nodded his head in approval.*

Mio: (I thought you were the weakest, as you took the longest to defeat your opponent. But, I am also impressed.)

Holland: (Thanks-)

Mio: (Don't be bothersome next time, just defeat the opponent.)

Holland: "Right." *He nodded his head at Blake and stared into his eyes, as if that was his way of communicating with Mio.*

Freya: (I understand too!) *She barked in thought, staring at Blake.*

Holland: *He smiled at Freya and chuckled to himself.* (She's grown-) *Cameron and Nathan flashstepped next to him, blowing straw and dirt around their legs.*

Nathan: "I know that was four, but are there any remaining?"

Mio: (His caution is warranted, search with all types of Astral and Neuronic fields at our disposal.)

Blake: "I got this, hey." *He glanced across the village with different types of visual perspectives.* "Nah, all good."

Cameron: *He faced the tribe members and Keno, readying himself to shout.* "It appears all targets have been neutralised."

Blake: "Huh?" *He noticed the entire village stare at them with disbelief.*

Mio: (This displeases me! If these lowly humans have the audacity to show you disrespect, I will feast on their Neurons!)

Blake: (I appreciate it, but it's OK. I'm used to it-)

Mio: (It is not okay! They will perish! The choice is in their actions.)

Freya: (Why is everyone staring at us?) *She glanced at Holland and unintentionally drooled fire on to the ground, sizzling the dirt underneath her.*

Holland: "I don't know." *He spoke under his breath, unsure what to do.*

Blake: (They ain't even saying unsexy shit.. They're just staring..) "Is there something on our faces, or wat?"

Man: "I.. Don't-"

Woman: "Amazing."

Scoldrant: *A snow bear-like Scoldrant stood on all fours.* (They're amazing-)

Apollo: *He dived through the air and shrunk in size, landing on Cameron's shoulder.* (Cameron.)

Cameron: (Are there any remaining outside the village's Spacial Funnel?)

Apollo: (Negative. All targets have indeed been neutralised.) *He squawked, spreading his wings in a proud manner.*

Holland: *He watched Freya return to her normal state, noticing her wings made of fire swirl and extinguish into nothing.* "We've got to heal Keno's wound-"

Keno: *He listened to the party with heightened hearing and slowly stood up.* (Thank you, Kosmo.)

Holland: (He's getting up-?)

Keno: *He smiled and slowly controlled his breathing.* "Kosmo has already been healing me, from within my inner-self."

Holland: (Awesome.)

Nathan: "That's all the creatures." *He spoke in an accomplished-like manner, glancing at each party member.*

Blake: "Yea."

Nathan: "We have more stuff to do back in the city." *He mumbled in his deep voice to the party.*

Holland: *He looked at Nathan and Blake, grunting in agreement.* "Not to be sudden, but we got to go."

Cameron: "Indeed-" *He turned around.*

Nathan: *He glanced at Keno and turned around, taking a step forward.* "Sorry, it's important-"

Man: *He stood up in an urgent manner.* "Wait." *His words caused the party to face him with curiosity.*

Chapter 4: Restorative Initiative

Alicia: "There." *She stepped back and opened her hand, causing strands of hair to blow away in the wind.*

Lance: *He turned around with an innocent face and looked up, staring at the hair on his fringe.* "Does it look good?"

Alicia: "It's what it looked like before I left you on the Sheridan."

Lance: "So.. Does it look good?"

Alicia: "It makes you look more rugged, like Holland."

Lance: "Umm." *He flicked his hair on the side.* "Is that a good thing?"

Alicia: *She bit her bottom lip, taking a step closer.* "It looks even better-" *She stood on her toes and wrapped her arms around Lance's neck before kissing him.*

Lance: *He smirked and opened his eyes.* "So, I'll take that as a yes."

Alicia: "Y-Yep, tee hee." *She giggled, admiring his new hair.*

Lance: "Wait, so you think Holland is rugged?" *He smirked with slight jealousy.*

Alicia: "Don't know." *She stepped away and giggled, pretending to be mean to Lance.*

Lance: "Nah, wateva." *He crossed his arms and pouted, turning away like a child.*

Alicia: "I guess, I'll have to go to the city by myself."

Lance: "Good, humph."

Alicia: *She quickly jogged towards the city.* "I might say hello to Holland."

Lance: "Oi, wait for me!" *He turned around and quickly jogged after Alicia.*

Alicia: "You can't catch me-"

Lance: *He smirked and flashstepped behind Alicia.* "Rawrr." *He caught her in his arms, causing her to squeal with laughter.* "Aha, gotcha."

Alicia: "Tee hee."

Lance: "So, Holland looks good?" *He awkwardly looked away, sounding a little serious.*

Alicia: *She faced Lance, looking at him with a smile.* "You look way better."

Lance: "How better?" *He pouted.*

Alicia: "Over this much." *She spread her arms far apart.*

Lance: "Not good enough."

Alicia: "Over infinity."

Lance: *He smirked and slowly leant forward, closing his eyes.* "Good-" *He gently kissed Alicia on the lips.*

Alicia: *She leant back, causing a sound to pop from her lips.* "H-Huh?" *She touched her mouth and smiled with uncertainty.*

Lance: *He smirked and bit his bottom lip.* "That smackin'-pop sound was pretty kool."

Alicia: "Tee hee-" *She pulled Lance's hand towards the city.*

Lance: "OK." *He rolled his eyes.* (I feel pretty good right now-)

Alicia: "Let's go."

Lance: *He rolled his eyes again as Alicia led him towards the city.* "So eager, aren't ya?"

Alicia: "I just feel that we should help out."

Lance: "Why?"

Alicia: "I-I just feel a little guilty."

Lance: *He smirked with a tiresome face.* (I don't really want to help, but I'll do it for her any day.)

Alicia: "Lance?"

Lance: "Alright, wateva."

Alicia: *She smiled in response.* (It's been so serious lately that this feels really nice.)

Lance: "Ya know, I love you so much, aye." *He sighed with blushing cheeks and looked up to the sky, placing his hands on the back of his head.*

Alicia: "Tee hee, I love you, too! Maybe I should cut your hair more often?"

Lance: "You get points for bein' beautiful, points for not killin' me, but ya lose some for tryin' to steal my humour."

Alicia: *She smiled and bit her bottom lip with a growing smile.* (What a grottom bottom.)

----------

PKMY: "You see what I'm doing? Wat am I doing?"

Season: *He turned around and faced Tyler ignoring PKMY.* "You fool." *He mumbled to himself.*

PKMY: "Eh?" (So wat's your move, Season?) *She thought to herself, watching Season hobble towards Tyler.*

Season: "This has pointlessly escalated."

Tyler: "H-Huh-?" *He looked up to Season, sniffing in confusion.*

Season: (Blast you, Amy-) *He stood in front of Tyler and hugged him.*

PKMY: "Heh." *She smirked, watching them hug in satisfaction.*

Teresa: "Hoh?" *She looked at Season and Tyler, placing a hand on her waist in confusion.* (Now they are hugging? Perhaps Amy did something?)

Tyler: *He closed his eyes and sniffed, whispering in Season's ear.* "Are you angry?"

Season: "No-" *He sighed in disappointment.*

Tyler: "..." *He opened his eyes, looking at the ruins over Season's shoulder.*

Season: "Overcome with emotions, I failed to listen to your point of view." *He stepped back and sniffed, wiping his eyes with his robes.*

Tyler: "B-But, I haven't explained-"

Season: *He shook his head.* "It doesn't matter."

PKMY: "Going by your own memories, Season." *She turned around and stared at a pile of rubble.* "The time for grieving is over."

Season: "Y-Yes." *He looked over his shoulder to PKMY in shock.*

PKMY: "Why so shocked?"

Season: "You know, reading people's memories is a little invasive."

PKMY: "Heh." *She shrugged her shoulders with a smirk as if she didn't care.*

Tyler: "U-Umm, let me explain-"

Season: *He shook his head with a smile.* "Like I said, it doesn't matter. I was shown your memory."

Tyler: "Oh, h-how?"

PKMY: "Me, idiot." *She mumbled and continued to inspect the area.*

Teresa: (It appears I need to relearn how emotions work.) *She sighed to herself, shaking her head full of confusion.*

Season: "I'm slightly embarrassed how I let my feelings control my personality like that."

Tyler: "Don't be."

Season: "Oh?"

Tyler: "If you didn't respond like that, then you wouldn't have been a good leader."

Season: (Tyler?) *He stared at Tyler in a dumbfounded manner.*

Tyler: "Because it shows you care." *He sniffed and nervously looked down.* "Even at your worst, I envy how you handle things."

Season: "Don't be silly-"

Tyler: "Like how you're able to stand there just after-"

PKMY: "Tyler."

Tyler: "A-Ah, yes?"

PKMY: "He's stopped, shut up."

Tyler: "Oh-"

Teresa: "On the contrary, PKMY, one thing I have learned, is to not hold or bottle up one's emotions."

PKMY: "True."

Season: *He nodded his head in agreement.* "I'm fine. I've already grieved about this while I was recovering in Silver Wind Island."

Teresa: "..."

Season: "Just seeing the ruins with my own eyes shook me off guard."

Tyler: "Y-Yeah."

Season: "Tyler, I'm sorry. You're one of my most trusted companions, I don't want to lose that."

Tyler: "Y-You won't." *He smiled with a red puffy face.*

Season: *He smiled and brushed his hand through Tyler's hair in a brotherly manner.* (I have a slight headache.)

Teresa: "On my travels, I once heard this. You do not need certain people in your life, except for those who value you in theirs."

Season: "Teresa." *He mumbled.*

PKMY: (Heh, not bad, Teresa.) *She smirked in amazement and kept her back facing them, pretending not to be involved with the conversation.*

Tyler: "S-So-" *He nervously held his RPG bag and looked at each party member.* "What happens now?"

Season: "I'm not entirely sure." *He looked across the ruins, shaking his head.* "Go to Silver Wind Island?"

Teresa: "Is it not quite obvious?" *She spoke in confusion, causing Tyler and Season to look at her.*

Tyler: "What is?"

Season: "Please explain."

Teresa: "Rebuild."

Tyler: "Sorry?"

Teresa: "Build anew."

Season: "I don't know-" *He spoke in a weary manner, glancing at the piles of ruin.*

Tyler: (It would take a long time.)

PKMY: "One thing I didn't like about Surpreon." *She mumbled, catching Season's attention.*

Season: "I don't find jokes like that funny-"

PKMY: *She frowned, ignoring Season in an arrogant manner.* "I always wanted a large water fountain."

Season: "Don't be foolish-"

PKMY: "And I'm picturing three stone statues, to represent the new Surpreon."

Tyler: "Statues?"

Season: *He shook his head with a frown and looked over his shoulder, glancing at PKMY in frustration.* "This conversation has grown past my patience!"

PKMY: "Heh." *She turned around and grinned.* "I agree with Teresa, the longer we delay plans to repair, the longer we've got to wait."

Teresa: "Hoh?" *She looked at Season and waited for his response.*

Season: "It would take too long, all of my resources disappeared with the city."

Tyler: "I agree that it will take some time, but I'll be willing to help out."

Teresa: "I too, will have the intentions to assist if need be."

PKMY: *She rolled her eyes with a smile at Teresa.* "Yea, count me in."

Season: "I don't know-"

Tyler: "Yeah, what have we got to lose?"

Season: "Nothing-" *He paused in thought.* "-Time?"

Teresa: "If you do not keep yourself busy, you may exhaust the same amount of time pondering on the destruction of Surpreon."

Season: "Oh.."

Tyler: "Yeah.."

PKMY: (Teresa, she's throwing out these deep good sentences.)

Teresa: "Hmm?" (Did I say something inappropriate?)

PKMY: (Nah, don't worry about it.)

Teresa: (I will not.)

Tyler: "So, what do you say?" *He grasped the strap of the RPG bag, looking at Season in suspense.*

Season: "..."

PKMY: "Well?!"
Teresa: "Hmm?"

Season: "Oh, alright." *He smiled in defeat.*

Tyler: "Yay." *He smiled with slight sadness.*

PKMY: "Yahoo!" *She jumped up and smirked, punching the air in front of her in excitement.*

Teresa: "This is great." *She placed her hand in front of Tyler's face with an emotionless expression.*

Tyler: "U-Umm, what's wrong?" *He leant away from Teresa's hand feeling uncomfortable.*

Teresa: "I have witnessed Lance do this, hit it."

Tyler: "O-Oh, haha." *He awkwardly chuckled and slapped Teresa's hand for a hi-five.*

Teresa: "Indeed." *She looked at PKMY and Season with gratification.*

PKMY: (Heh-) *She chuckled in thought, hiding her emotions from Teresa.*

Season: "Where to start?" *He brushed dirt and charcoal off his robes, glancing around the city.*

PKMY: "Well, let's head back to Silver Wind Island."

Teresa: "Precisely what I was going to say-" *She looked at Season, flicking her hair over her shoulder.* "You mentioned your resources have depleted."

Season: "Yes."

Teresa: "It is obvious and encouraged to find more."

Season: "Right!"

Tyler: *He sniffed and smiled with excitement.* "I-If it's okay with you, Season, I've always wanted to have a garden with certain flowers to scent the air. After Battling Oxident, it usually gets a little smelly."

PKMY: "I agree! Man, people stink."

Season: "Alright."

PKMY: "I'd request a cabin to drink and relax, I've grown to like guild taverns."

Season: "Hohoho, alright."

Teresa: "I personally will see a significant improvement if you channel a special teleportation glyph from and to Silver Wind Island."

Season: "That's actually an excellent idea."

Teresa: "Of course? It was mine, was it not?"

Season: "Hohoho, I like this new Teresa."

Teresa: "Hoh?"

PKMY: *She started to walk towards the crack in the wall.* "Righto, we've already started to make plans, don't forget it, Tyler."

Tyler: "N-No, I won't!" *He watched PKMY step through the crack.*

*Teresa, Season and Tyler started to walk towards the crack to exit the city.*

Season: "You don't have to help if you're too busy."

Teresa: "Family should be one's first priority."

Season: "But-"

Teresa: "Humph." *She stepped through the crack and walked towards the glowing glyph, which responded to PKMY's presence.*

Tyler: *He followed the party out of Surpreon and reached into the RPG bag, pulling out a notepad.* (Alright, a list-) *He focused his attention on the pad and started to write on it, stopping in front of Season, PKMY and Teresa who all stood on the glyph.*

Season: *He grabbed Tyler's bag and pulled him on top of the glyph.* "PKMY, these statues, what did you have in mind?" *The area started to blur and swirl around him.*

PKMY: "Heh, don't worry, I've already got it figured out." *The party disappeared in a flash of purple light.*

----------

*Blake, Nathan, Cameron, Holland, Apollo and Freya stood in a line facing the entire village.*

Girl: "..." *She slowly approached the party, causing Freya to growl.*

Blake: *He leant to one side and placed his hand on his waist.* (Wat's happening?)

Mio: (Honestly, after that disrespect, I'm surprised we aren't just heading back. We have accomplished what we came here for.)

Nathan: *He listened to Freya's growls intensify the closer the girl shuffled towards them.* (What are we doing here? The was a reason why I left my village long ago-)

Girl: "Umm-" *She quickly showed her tribal markings under her arm, which instinctively caused Freya to become docile.*

Freya: "Gruff." *She wagged her tail in a welcoming manner.*

Girl: *She leant forward and pet Freya on the head.* "Wow, her fur is really soft!"

Man: *He stepped forward in astonishment.* "How, did-?" *He pointed at Holland, Blake and Nathan in shock.*

Middle-Aged Man: "I don't see what the excitement's over? They're the fails of the tribe-"
Blake: (Piece of unsexy shit-)

Old Woman: "Yet, it seems these failures have saved the entire tribe."
Blake: (Hey?) *He looked surprised at the old woman's response.*

Middle-Aged Man: "Oh, how?" *He sounded unconvinced.*

Keno: (He was unconscious when they saved us from those creatures.)

Old Woman: "From what I witnessed, they displayed teamwork, they displayed power, three displayed high-level Scoldrant integration. And lastly, they defeated the enemies the entire tribe could not, including our elder."

Middle-Aged Man: "Well-"

Nathan: "This feels awkward." *He mumbled to Holland.*

Holland: "But a good awkward?" *He mumbled back.*

Nathan: "Yeah." *He smirked.*

Blake: "No wai, this is getting, like, annoying, hey."

Woman: *She noticed Blake's skin revert back to normal.* "How did your body do that? You had wings."

Blake: "..."

Apollo: (Blake.. We are in their home.)

Blake: *He hissed under his breath.* "My partner-"

Keno: "It's a unique bloodline from one of our relative cousins."

Woman: "Oh?" *Her spider-like Scoldrant crawled up to Apollo and inspected him.*

Apollo: (If it moves an inch, attack it!)

Cameron: *He half smirked in response.* (Are you frightened of arachnids?)

Keno: "Our cousins have become one with their Scoldrant counterparts. It seems Blake has done the same?" *He looked at Blake for confirmation.*

Mio: (He's correct.)

Blake: "Yea, pretty sick aye."

Keno: "Ah, Cameron, one of our finest Scoldrant Users. It's a pleasure to see you again."

Cameron: "And it is you."

Nathan: "What exactly did you want us for?"

Blake: "Question of the day."

Keno: "I'll tell you briefly-" *Mature members of the tribe gathered around Keno, causing him to turn around.*

Blake: (Who are they?)

Mio: (From their scent, one of the oldest tribal leaders.)

Blake: (Aye?)

Holland: "Keno?"

Nathan: *He looked at Blake, noticing his facial expression.* "Any idea?"

Blake: "Apparently, one of the oldest leaders?"

Nathan: (What?!)
Cameron: (What business do they have with us?!)

Keno: *He looked over his shoulder to the party.* "Please wait here for a moment."

Nathan: "Okay." *He watched Keno and the mature tribe members walk towards a hut.*

Blake: "We can't be too long aye." *He whispered to the party, reminding them of their other duties.*

Cameron: "I concur with Blake."

Nathan: "Depending what they want, we'll just have to tell them we got to go."

Holland: "Hmm, or at least tell them we'll be at Silver Wind Island?"

Cameron: "That is the best logical suggestion."

Blake: "Like, wasn't that wat we were gonna do anyway?! Yuck, this is annoying!"

Holland: *He glanced at Blake in confusion.* "Hey, when could you do that with your body?"

Blake: "Oh? You mean how I summoned my Scoldrant through my body?"

Mio: (Your Scoldrant?)

Blake: (Don't have a sook because of my choice of words.)

Holland: "Yeah, you looked like the tribe members we encountered with Sebastian."

Blake: "Pretty kool, amirite?"

Cameron: "Tssk."

Blake: "Oi?"

Cameron: "I can not believe you did not show me already."

Blake: "Sorry."

Cameron: "Just do not do it again. I expect to be the first person to witness whatever power-up you receive."

Blake: "Rite!"

*An old woman and man approached Nathan, catching his attention.*

Nathan: "Can I help you?"

Old Woman: "Our Soul Links have weakened, which has caused us to age prematurely-"

Nathan: "Umm?"

Old Man: "But certainly you haven't forgotten us?"

Nathan: *He awkwardly stared at the man, slowly shaking his head.* "I don't.."

Mio: (They've got a similar scent.)

Blake: "Oi, Nath, my sexy bitch says they've got a similar scent to you."

Nathan: *Blake's words caused him to look at them closer.* "Huh?"

Old Man: *He chuckled, watching realisation fill Nathan's face.* "I was getting worried for a moment."

Nathan: "Father? Mother?" *He sounded surprised, catching Holland's attention.*

Holland: (They look really old?)

Apollo: *He glanced at Holland.* (Soul Link improves and prolongs longevity to both partners.. If something happened to their Soul Link, maybe their real age is showing.)

Old Man: "We see you still haven't obtained your companion."

Nathan: "No-"

Old Woman: "Nor invested the time to train with Rostical."

Nathan: "No." *He looked down and was filled with angst.*

Old Man: "You're not a Rostical User."

Old Woman: "Or a Scoldrant User."

Nathan: *He gritted his teeth.* "No, and no."

Blake: (They're just titles, wrinkly hags.) *He rolled his eyes, purposely keeping his thoughts to himself.*

Holland: "Hey, not sure if you remember me-" *He took a step forward, trying to catch Nathan's parents' attention.* "But you shouldn't categorise him-"

Blake: "Or give him a title, aye." *He hissed in a defensive manner.*

Cameron: "And it is common knowledge that not everyone can train to learn Remenistal. It has necessary requirements."

Nathan: "Guys." *He mumbled as he stood frozen, stricken with the authority figures in front of him.*

Old Man: "Nathan, it's true we wanted you to be a Rostical User."

Old Woman: "It was so you would be a better person."

Nathan: "A better person? You both shoved your idealistic views on me. You didn't give me the chance, or ask me what I wanted!"

Old Woman: "That is true."

Nathan: "And now look at me." *He hit his chest with both hands several times, emphasising himself.* "I've mastered the sword arts, I've acquired the strongest sword, I've learnt how to flashstep-"

Mio: (For his limitations and what he does to fight, he is undoubtedly the strongest swordsman I've ever witnessed.)

Blake: (Yea, it was totes unsexy having to fight him.)

Old Man: "And now look at you." *He smiled proudly.*

Nathan: *He froze when he noticed his father's smile.* "No!" *He frowned and took a step forward.* "You don't deserve to give me that look!"

Old Woman: "Look how big you've become-"

Nathan: "I've spent my entire drive becoming something I wanted-" *He reached behind his back and pulled forward, unsheathing The Sword of Memories.*

Old Man: *He watched rainbow coloured sparks scatter the air in amazement.* "I saw you fight-"

Nathan: "Stop talking like you're proud of me!"

Blake: "Errr.." *He glanced at Cameron with a growingly awkward face.* (This is totes awks.)

Cameron: (I concur-)

Holland: "Blake, Cameron-" *He caught their attention and started to walk away.*

Blake: "Oh thank-" *He rolled his eyes in relief and turned around, strutting towards Holland.*
Cameron: "Let us go-" *He spoke to Freya and Apollo, before walking towards Blake and Holland.*

Blake: *He leant on his side and crossed his arms, nudging his head back at Nathan.* "How long ya think this will go for?"

Holland: "We still gotta find out why Keno wanted to talk to us."

Mio: (I'm also quite intrigued with what those bothersome and disrespectful people have to say for themselves.)

Cameron: "I have learnt something from being with the warriors."

Blake: "The moral codes?"

Holland: "Discipline?"

Cameron: "Negative."

Blake: *He smiled and looked at Cameron.* "Then what?"

Cameron: "Everything happens for a reason."

Holland: "Hmm?" *He sounded shocked.*

Blake: *He giggled and looked down to the dirt ground.* "Yeah, they kinda do hey."

Cameron: *He nodded his head and looked to his side, watching Nathan argue with his parents.* (For a reason, even if we can not explain it at the time, it just happens.)

----------

*Aurora lights swirled in front of five stone pillars and a water fountain which sat in the middle.*

Madora: *Her hair flapped to each side and she opened her eyes, as aurora lights discharged off her body.* "Back home-"

*The five stone pillars made beautiful sounds, causing Madora to chuckle in response.*

Madora: "Ah, it seems you've missed me too?" *She spoke to the stone pillars and stepped on a platform, slowly staggering towards the water fountain.* "I'm here just for my own curiosity."

*Sounds of waves echoed around the small village, giving a relaxed secluded-like feeling.*

Madora: "Now that the Consultant has been defeated, including Sofia."

*Madora hobbled to each side and moved her head, causing her hair to move behind her shoulder on its own accord.*

Madora: "Even the yellow-eyed demon, Gabriel..." *She stopped at the water fountain and leant forward, staring into her own reflection.* "What is in store for us next?"

*The water rippled and shined aurora colours, causing Madora to nod her head.*

Madora: "So, this really is the end of all the drama." *She sighed in disbelief and smiled with happiness.* "So it's time for rebuilding and recovery it seems."

*The water fountain reverted back to normal and Madora turned around, facing the four small huts.*

Madora: "I believe I will take a few items with me before making my way back to Silver Wind Island." *She stopped and smiled to herself.* (Knowing that the Valkyrie has finally awakened, it almost feels like I'm not alone any more.)

*Madora shook her head and chuckled at herself, hobbling towards the closest hut.*

----------

Holland: *He watched Nathan hug the old woman and man before stepping away.* "I think it went well."

Blake: "Probs, he isn't having a cry any more." *He shrugged his shoulder, sounding optimistic.*

Cameron: "Hmph." *He chuckled.*

*Keno and the mature tribe members shuffled out of the hut and instantly walked towards the party.*

Blake: *He focused towards a hut.* (The old geezers went in there while we wait like idiots, yuck!)

Apollo: (Their heightened emotions are plateauing.)

Blake: (Oh? Reunion is ova?)

Apollo: (You don't care?)

Blake: (Nah, I do for him, but I don't, like, care about parents, hey.)

Mio: (It's justified, trust me.)

*Keno and the mature tribe members shuffled out of the hut and instantly walked towards the party.*

Blake: (About time.)

Mio: (I am just as impatient as you.)

Holland: "Looks like something is going to happen now."

Cameron: "It would seem so."

Nathan: *He watched his parents walk towards Keno.* (I feel so good.) *He looked at his sword and smiled, walking towards the party.*

Blake: "How are ya?"

Nathan: *He smirked, placing his hand on Blake's shoulders.* "Seems like I misunderstood my parents and they misunderstood me."

Blake: "A better story than me, fufufu."

Nathan: *He shook his head.* "Who needs them. You've got us now."

Blake: *He looked confused.* "Should I call ya pops?"

Nathan: "Haha ha ha."

Keno: *He coughed and faced the villagers.* "May we have everyone's attention!"

*The villagers and Scoldrants instantly stopped talking and gave Keno their full attention.*

Cameron: "An announcement."

Blake: "Wat is this about?"

Mio: (Let us just go.)

Blake: (Sounds good.)

Cameron: "Source for information." *He glanced at Nathan, catching Holland's attention.*

Holland: "Did your parents mention anything, Nath?"

Nathan: "I don't know, and no." *He shook his head and stopped next to Cameron, staring at Keno in confusion.*

Keno: "I would like to introduce you all, to the new high ranking members of the tribe." *His words cued four old women to carefully walk beside him.*

Holland: "High ranking?"
Nathan: "Oh?" *He sighed with disappointment, as if he was expecting something better.*

Blake: "Aye?" *He sounded confused, glancing at Nathan.* "You know more than me about the village's rituals."

Nathan: "We're just witnessing a graduation or something."

Cameron: "It would seem so."

Blake: "Are ya freaking serious?"

Nathan: "Out of respect, we should watch whoever is receiving the ceremony."

Blake: "Not being a dog, but we didn't have to wait for this, aye."

Mio: (Despite how they treated you, respect their culture.)

Blake: (Total, watevs. Wat makes you suddenly on their side? They disrespected us first.)

Mio: (Just wait..)

Blake: *He looked intrigued.* (You know somefing, don't ya?)

Holland: "I've only ever seen one ceremony, where a high levelled Scoldrant User became an elder to a new tribe."

Nathan: "So?"

Holland: "This is that ceremony."

Cameron: *He nodded his head, folding his arms in a professional manner.* "It is the highest distinction one of our kind can-"

Keno: "I would like to take the privilege of bestowing Holland Breeze, Blake Hegarty, Nathan Brails and Cameron McClutchie, the honour of these sacred items."

Holland: "What?" *He gasped in disbelief.*
Blake: "Say wha?"
Cameron: "Hmm?" *He looked startled, unintentionally lowering his arms.*
Nathan: "W-Wait, sorry-?" *He placed the sword behind his back, causing it to warp and disappear.*

Freya: (Did he mean us?)
Apollo: (Addressed to us?)
Mio: "..."

Keno: *He paused, giving the party and the villagers time to register what he said.* "..."

Nathan: *He shook his head.* "I'm not a Scoldrant-"

Keno: "Please present the four piercings to these extraordinary men!" *His words cued the women to step up to each party member.*

Blake: *He looked down and noticed green and purple feathers, in a form of a piercing.* "Oh my-" *He hissed under his breath, covering his mouth with both hands in shock.*

Cameron: (This can not be.)

Apollo: (Cameron..) *He spoke in disbelief.*

Mio: (The highest honour a Scoldrant User can receive.)

Blake: (When did you know?)

Mio: (Don't be bothersome.)

Women: "Please accept this." *They spoke at the same time with different pitch tones.*

Keno: "Although-" *He turned around, facing the villagers in curiosity.* "Despite being spoken and agreed upon with the highest ranking order of the tribe members-"

Apollo: (Does this mean they accept Blake?)

Cameron: (I do not know.. I am quite flabbergasted in regards to what is happening right now.)

Blake: (You say this is the highest ranked ceremony, but they were just disrespecting us?)

Mio: (It would seem the people that matter don't feel this way.)

Keno: "Is there anyone to disagree with this?" *He shouted with his old yet powerful voice, waiting for a response.*

Holland: (I can't believe it.) *He smiled in shock.*

Mio: (There you go, it's time for the truth.)

Keno: "With the power of the tribal leaders-" *He scanned across the village and smiled to himself, slowly facing the party.* "We acknowledge your power and hereby promote you all to high ranking Scoldrant Users!"

Nathan: (Despite not being a Scoldrant User..) *He thought in a slow-like manner, staring at the piercings with widening eyes.* (They're still considering me Guardian level?)

Blake: *He smirked at the feathered piercing.* (Guardian? Bitch please, we're Ancioldrant level.)

Keno: *He spoke with a proud smile, staring at golden strings inside Blake, Holland and Cameron.* (They've done it.)

Holland: "High... Ranking." *He spoke on his breath in amazement, triggering a flashback.*

--

Holland: "We found it." *He ran into a small village which concealed itself with its surroundings.*

Freya: *She closely followed Holland, sticking her tongue out.* "Geroow."

Holland: (Ah, there's someone-) *He ran up to a man, who fed a Scoldrant from his hand.* "Do you know where Keno is?"

Man: "I don't know." *He grunted and looked down, noticing Freya.* (A Scoldrant User?) "Arh, he's in there." *He stepped to the side, pointing to a straw made hut.*

Holland: "Thanks." *He chuckled and ran towards the hut in excitement.*

Freya: *She stopped behind Holland, staring at the door with curiosity.* "Grarh?"

Holland: "Shh." *He slowly walked into the hut, noticing Keno with his eyes shut.*

Keno: *He appeared to be doing a form of Tai Chi with his Scoldrant.* "Excellent, flow between each other-" *He kept his eyes closed and slowly stood on one leg, gently swaying his arms.*

Holland: *He stepped on the bamboo-like floor, catching Keno's attention.* "Oops-"

Keno: *He opened his eyes, staring at Holland with an emotionless face.* "Oh? So you didn't run away?"

Holland: "No?" (Nice to see you too.)

Keno: "Hmm?"

Holland: "What is it?"

Keno: "You have a different aura about you?" *He noticed something move in Holland's shadow.* "What have you got behind there?"

Holland: *He smiled, looking down to his side.* "I'm ready."

Keno: (Ready?)

*Freya trotted from behind Holland, obediently sitting next to him oblivious to her surroundings.*

Keno: (Good work!) *He happily thought to himself with a calm face.* "Ready for what?"

Holland: "I'm ready to become Guardian rank."

Keno: "Guardian?" *He tried to conceal his laughter.* "Excuse me? Is that a joke, Holland?"

Holland: *He puffed out chest, looking at Keno with seriousness.* "No, I'm not."

Keno: "I understand this means a lot to you."

Holland: "Yeah-"

Keno: "I've watched you grow up, and I can see myself in you."

Holland: "Okay?"

Keno: "So, I'll tell you what I should've been told."

Holland: "Sure?"

Keno: "You are nowhere near that level-" *He looked down, sighing to himself.* "You're pathetic for even thinking that."

Holland: "Huh? What do you mean?"

Keno: *He heightened his hearing, listening to Holland's heartbeat.* (It seems my words have hurt him, but he's good at not showing it.)

Holland: *He puffed out his chest, slightly frowning with determination.* "I'm stronger!-"

Keno: *He looked at his partner and sighed.* "Show me, the connection."

Holland: "Okay." *He spoke as if his motivation vanished.*

Freya: "Harwooh?"

Holland: *He faced Freya, closing his eyes.* (I learnt how to do this-) *Two fluoro blue strings materialised from his chest.*

Keno: *He leant on his Scoldrant for support, watching the faint strings tug between their chests.* "I'm waiting?"

Holland: *He opened his eyes, looking confused.* "That was it?"

Keno: "Holland." (This is the only way to make you understand.)

Holland: *He gathered his attention to Keno.* "Yeah?"

Keno: "I will show you the power gap in our powers." *He stepped back and faced his Scoldrant, causing a blue string to materialise between them.*

Holland: *He lowered his hands, causing Freya to jump into his arms.* (What's the difference? It looks the same-)

Keno: "Kosmo-"

*Hundreds of golden strings suddenly materialised between them, causing Freya to yelp in shock.*

Keno: "What you're seeing now, is the connection between every available Neuron and Astragon point, gate and slot."

Holland: *He looked shocked and amazed with widening eyes.* (They're golden-)

Keno: "When your bond forms even further-"

Holland: *He watched Kosmo suddenly disintegrate into nothing, causing him to gasp.* "What happened to-?!"

Keno: *He stood up straight, forming fists in a powerful-like manner.* "..."

Holland: "What happened-?"

Keno: *He chuckled, raising his hands.* "You have no idea what our kind can do-"

Freya: "Grr-" *She growled at Keno, causing Holland to pat her head.*

Keno: *He stared at Holland, as a large green glyph spiralled above him.* "This is the power of a Soul Link-"

*A Scoldrant made of wood suddenly appeared in front of Holland, binding him in vines.*

Holland: "Ah!-" *He looked shocked, staring at Keno in confusion.*

Keno: "Barck, enough."

Barck: "..." *It looked over its shoulder and nodded its head before disintegrating into nothing.*

Holland: *He rubbed his shoulder, checking to see if Freya was alright.* "What was that Scoldrant? Where did Kosmo go? And why are you standing up straight?! Weren't you having troubles with your back-?"

Keno: "I am, but I don't have my normal worries when I'm like this." *He deeply inhaled, slowly releasing his breath.*

Kosmo: *It rematerialised next to Keno, glaring at Holland.* "..."

Keno: "There is something very important I need to tell you."

Holland: "What about my other questions-?"

Keno: "Now that you've Soul Linked, whatever happens to either of you, will happen to the other."

Freya: "Gerooh?" *She tilted her head to one side in confusion.*

Holland: "What do you mean?"

Keno: *His posture weakened, causing him to lean against Kosmo.* "This is your greatest strength and now your greatest weakness."

Holland: "..."
Freya: "Grarff?"

Keno: *He looked at Freya, nodding his head in understanding.* "I mean, for example, whatever happens to Kosmo, happens to me."

Holland: "What about death?"

Keno: "That too-"

Holland: (What-?!)

Keno: "The Soul Link, we both benefit from this. The Scoldrant's life is significantly prolonged and we receive special gifts-"

Kosmo: (And even a best friend.) *Its voice echoed in Keno's mind, causing him to smile.*

Holland: *He shook his head in confusion, ignoring what Keno said.* "But I've already established a Soul Link, I'm ready to become a Guardian, despite the power gap-"

Keno: "Simple minded! It took me seven years to have Kosmo evolve!"

Holland: "E-volve?"

Keno: "I have not found the correct term, but it's when the Scoldrant reaches a certain physical or emotional maturity."

Holland: "How come I haven't heard of this before?"

Keno: "There are a lot of things you don't know. Summonce Scarbras, Tnardloicna Users, Evolve, The Sacred Rostic Tribe, Scoldrant-induced Azure Bursts."

Holland: "The Sacred Rostic Tribe-?"

Kosmo: (Others are approaching-)

Keno: *He glanced at Kosmo, nodding his head in recognition.* "You need to leave, Holland-"

Holland: "Wha-?! Why?!"

Keno: "You've set a bad example for the children, so please, for me-"

Freya: *She looked up and noticed Holland's face, causing her to growl at Keno.* "Grarf!"

Kosmo: (Silence!) *It glared at Freya, causing her to whimper in Holland's arms.*

Keno: "Get stronger and prove to the village what you've become."

Holland: *He puffed out his chest and frowned, shaking his head.* "I'm not going."

Keno: "Tssk, tssk, Holland." *He looked at Kosmo and nodded his head.* "I'm not asking you to leave, I'm telling you to leave."

*Kosmo suddenly flashstepped in front of Holland, hissing in his face.*

Holland: *He stepped back as a blast of wind pushed him back.* (Whoa, wow-) "Okay, fine."

--

Holland: *He smiled with watering eyes, catching Freya's attention.* "I remember that."

Freya: (Holland?)

Holland: (We.. We did it..)

Freya: "Gerooh?"

Holland: (Our dream.. The phoenix and now this.)

*The women carefully presented the piercings with both hands to each party member.*

Keno: *He purposely coughed, causing the party to slowly grab the piercings.* (Days like this aren't common. Having a random encounter with old tribe members and then promoting them to the high rankings-)

Holland: "A-Are you sure?" *He looked at Keno with uncertainty.*

Keno: "Yes." *He smiled proudly, watching each party member raise the piercings to their eyebrows.* "And don't worry, the feather's size is adjustable."

Holland: *He clipped the piercing through the hole in his eyebrow and the feather's size decreased.* "Wow-"

Freya: *Holland's new piercing suddenly materialised in her eyebrow.* "Gruff?"

Blake: *He took out his old piercing and eagerly placed the new one in.* "How does it look?" *He whispered to Cameron, as he lowered his arms.*

Cameron: "Excellent."

*The women stepped away and Keno started clapping, causing the entire village to applaud the party members.*

Holland: *His eyes watered in happiness.* "I don't know what to say."

Cameron: "It is a great honour receiving this."

Nathan: *He smiled with emotion, unsure what to say.* (Despite titles being so easily thrown around.. Maybe I was wrong with my own heritage's point of view?)

Freya: (Holland.. Why are you getting upset?)

Holland: (I'm happy, I've been wanting this for a very long time.)

Freya: "Ruff." *She wagged her tail in happiness for Holland.*

Blake: *He looked up and stared at his new piercing, playing with the feathers.* "U-Umm, old-.. Keno."

Keno: "Yes?"

Blake: "I just wanted to let ya know, that the chief and his tribal members are at Silver Wind Island."

Keno: "Oh really?" *He mumbled to himself and looked across the village in thought.*

Nathan: "Oh-" (This excitement has made me lose my track of thought.) "Keno, and respected elders."

Keno: "Nathan?"

Nathan: *He shook his head and stood up straight, looking at the mature tribe members behind Keno.* "We have business to deal with in Silver Wind Island-"

Blake: (Get our prize and dash afterwards? Fufufu. You can tell he's the type to dine and dash.)

Keno: *He raised his hand, causing Nathan to stop talking.* "Our new high ranking members have business to do in Silver Wind Island, also our distance cousins are residing there too."

Man: "Distant cousins?"

Keno: "The ones that portray the appearance of their partners." *His words caused gasps and mutters to ignite through the villagers.*

Blake: (Am I the only one that listens around here? This was already said before..)

Mio: (It must be my influence.)

Blake: (Fufufu, sure, tell yourself that, my sexy Ancioldrant.)

Nathan: (Keno's body language.. Does he intend to come?)

Keno: *He noticed the villager's interest, causing him to smile.* "If it's no inconvenience-" *He faced the party again, slightly bowing with respect.*

Cameron: (He is bowing to us?)

Blake: *He looked just as surprised as Cameron.* (It's totes unusual to hear you stutter.)

Cameron: (I had not anticipated this type of action-)

Keno: "I-, we would like to accompany you to the city." *The villagers and Scoldrants behind him roared, screeched and whistled in agreement.*

Nathan: "With the Scoldrants?"

Cameron: "Hmm?" *He glanced at Nathan in a curious manner.* "Why would that be a problem?"

Keno: *He stared at Cameron.* "Scoldrant Users have been frowned upon."

Cameron: "Really? How childish."

Nathan: "Are you seriously telling me, Scoldrant Users were never frowned upon in Sorrowprax?"

Cameron: "Negative."

Blake: "Nah, babe. They are."

Cameron: "At least, never to my presence then."

Holland: *He smiled and formed a fist.* "That would be awesome, in times like this, only fools would not be willing to accept us."

Blake: "Yea!"

Nathan: *He glanced at the villagers, noticing the dried blood on their skin and clothes.* "What about all their wounds?"

Cameron: "As a Scoldrant User, our ability to heal is twice as fast." *He smiled at Apollo.*

Apollo: "Sqcork!" *He flapped his wings in agreement.*

Blake: "Why are you asking such unsexy questions?"

Nathan: *He placed one hand on the side of his head.* (I think I'm a little flustered from meeting my parents-)

Blake: "Anywho, our cousins are in the city and peeps are totes liking them, hey."

Keno: *The crowd cheered at Cameron and Blake in agreement, causing Keno to chuckle.* "Alright, off to Silver Wind Island!"

Holland: *He smiled and wiped away the tears of happiness.* "Alright!"

----------

*Lance and Alicia entered the city with smiles, listening to the lively sounds of the people.*

Lance: *He deeply inhaled and sniffed, touching his nose.* "Hey, no more salty air."

Alicia: "Yep." *She smiled at Lance and watched him walk forward, causing her to skip by his side.*

*The surrounding citizens heard Alicia and Lance, causing them to stop working.*

Lance: *He noticed the people stare at him with interest faces.* "Umm, OK?" *He gave the surrounding people a feral look.*

Alicia: "It looks like everyone has already started cleaning-" *She noticed a large group of people gathering around the castle.*

Lance: "Wat's happenin' now?" *He noticed the clustered group of people and sighed, holding Alicia's hand.* "Let's check it out."

Alicia: "Yep." *She walked with Lance down the road-like path towards the cluster of people.*

Season: "So, after this shocking news!-" *His voice echoed, catching Alicia and Lance's attention.*

Lance: "Wut?" *He grunted in confusion and started to jog.*

Man: *The footsteps of Alicia and Lance caused him to turn around.* "Huh? Hey! That's him!" *He yelled and pointed at Lance, causing nearby people to turn around and stare at Lance.*

Alicia: "Th-They're staring at us."

Lance: "That's him?" *He mumbled to himself, suddenly frowning in response.* "Wait-" *He let go of Alicia's hand and stood in a defensive manner.* "You want a piece of me or somethin'-?!"

*Clusters of citizens yelled in excitement and cheered at Lance.*

Lance: "H-Huh?" *He stepped back in shock and looked at Alicia.*

Alicia: "I don't know." *She shrugged her shoulders in confusion.*

Man: "Everyone! This is the man that shot that destructive creature to The Astral Plains!"

Woman: "The one that shot the mansion-sized lightning!?" *She quickly turned around and looked at Lance, starting to clap her hands in excitement.*

Season: *He stopped in mid-sentence and gathered his attention to the cheering crowd.* "Lance?" *He yelled out with uncertainty.*

Lance: *He shuffled through the cheering crowd and into the clearing.* "Ah?" *He looked at the people, awkwardly waving his arm in acknowledgement and gratitude.*

Alicia: "Tee hee-" *She closely followed Lance and noticed his awkward wave, causing her to giggle.*

Man: "You're a hero!" *He shouted out to Lance, smiling in his presence.*

Lance: (Hero?)

Woman: "Please, take these, my hero!" *She presented a basket of bread and flowers to Lance.*

Alicia: "He's fine, thank you." *She smiled at the woman in gratitude, hiding her jealousy.*

Lance: *His face was red as he made his way towards Season.* (This is so embarrassin'.)

Season: "Alright." *His voice echoed from a glyph which shined under him.*

Alicia: (The glyph underneath Season is amplifying his voice like Battling Oxident.)

Lance: *He had images of the people's smiling faces.* (That was definitely a new experience for me-)

Season: *He raised his arms, catching the citizen's attention.* "That's enough for now!" *His voice caused the constant chatter to quieten down.*

Lance: *He noticed Tyler, Teresa, PKMY, Ginger, Lezard, Karol, Rachael and Luna.* (Looks like nearly everyone's here-)

Tyler: *He quickly walked up to Alicia and Lance.* "We're discussing preparations to rebuild Surpreon."

Alicia: "Rebuild Surpreon? What are you talking about?"

PKMY: "Shh." *She hissed at Lance.*

Lance: "Why did you hiss at me, I didn't even-"

PKMY: "Shhh."

Lance: "Wateva."

PKMY: "Wateva."

Lance: "Wateva your-"

Season: "Ahem." *His voice echoed loudly.* "Let us ignore our differences and work together, and through our combined efforts, let's bring forth the restoration of our famous landmark, Battling Oxident!"

Ginger: (That is my cue-) *She stepped forward and stood next to Season.* "As the representative of Silver Wind Island, I'd like us to fully support Surpreon one hundred percent! Please respond!"

Chief: *He growled from within the crowd.* "You have the support of The Sacred Tribe Members!"

Trinity and Infinity: "And us!" *They clapped each other's hands from within the crowd.*

Elizabeth: "Yes!"
Lehi: "Damn straight!"
Victoria: "You have our support!"

*The Rostic dancers nodded their heads in agreement, causing nearby cheers to grow louder.*

Trinity: (I'm so pleased-) *She looked at her parents then to her people in dancer-like garments while holding Infinity's hand with growing happiness.* (We did it-)

Twenty-Six: "And you have support from the warriors!" *She raised her fist, causing several warriors to cheer.*

Ginger: (How astonishing.. Such support. Asking people for volunteer work, I had not calculated such a large turnout.)

Rachael: *She leapt off the castle and landed on her feet before dropping to her knees while punching the ground with one fist.* (Looks like everyone is here.)

*The crowd cheered in Rachael's presence as she respectfully and quickly jogged past Ginger and Season towards the guild.*

Luna: "Rach."

Rachael: "Long time no see, guys."

Lezard: "Ooo, welcome back."

Rachael: *She smiled and looked past Lezard.* "Nathan."

Lezard: "No, it's Lez-"

Nathan: "Hey."

Holland: *He walked in front of the crowd, closely followed by villagers.* "And the help of the-"

Keno: "Scoldrant Users!" *He walked through the crowd and clustered in a group at the front.*

Madora: *She suddenly appeared in front of Season in a flash of aurora light.* "Don't forget me!"

Luna: *She smiled and straightened one arm, holding Nathan's hand.* "Welcome back, Natalie."

Nathan: *He shuffled forward and kissed Luna on the lips.* "Good to be back, shit nugget."

Luna: *She leant back in disgust.* "Hold up!"

Season: "I would like to thank everyone for their kind intentions to help us restore Surpreon!"

Ginger: "Ey-" *She looked over her shoulder to the castle doors.* "A teleportation glyph is being prepared as we speak!-"

Dawn: *She ran outside the castle holding a large white stone with purple lines carved in it.* "Here-" *She ran past the guild and in front of Ginger and Season.*

Season: (Dawn safely activated a teleportation glyph to Surpreon.. Impressive, the issue is that we needed a large ongoing glyph to allow volunteers to freely enter-)

Ginger: "Ey, Dawn, is it ready?" *She mumbled so only Dawn and Season could hear.*

Dawn: *She held the stone with both hands and raised it above her head.* "Hah!" *She slammed it on the ground, causing it to shatter everywhere.*

Lezard: "Chatters and whispered could be heard amongst the crowd in response to Dawn's strange behaviour-"

Luna: "Shut it, Lizard-"

Lezard: "Lezard."

Blake: "Watevs."
Luna: "Wateva."

Lezard: "Ooo, it's the whatever patrol."

Ginger: *She watched a massive purple glyph engrave itself on the ground.* (Those Astragons. It would appear whatever occurrence hindered teleportation has now been lifted.)

Dawn: "There." *She sighed in relief, watching the glyph slightly glow purple the more the patterns formed.*

Ginger: "Yeoshh."

Dawn: "For research." *She fist punched the air above her and smiled in relief.*

Chrisma: *She hobbled up to Lezard and fist punched the air.* "For research!"

Lezard: "Woop woop."
Chrisma: "Whoup whoup." *They wiggled their bottoms at the same time.*

Luna: "Eww."

Season: "Perfect. When you're ready, collect your things and meet us at Surpreon!" *He yelled with motivation before walking towards the glyph.*

Lance: "Wait, wat's goin' on?" *He watched Season disappear in a flash of purple light.*

PKMY: *She stormed past Lance.* "You know, after all this, you still don't get things! We're rebuilding Surpreon because it was destroyed, so shut it and help us." *She grunted and rolled her eyes, walking towards the glyph.*

Lance: "Gee, someone's cranky."

Alicia: (Surpreon was destroyed, that's horrible.)

Ginger: *She held her breath and slowly exhaled.* "Ey, Rachael, Luna, please assist Dawn in collecting whatever Rosterology items she needs to work expeditiously."

Rachael: "Sure thing."

Luna: "Got it."

Ginger: *She ran up to the glyph and faced the guild.* "Are you coming?"

Lezard: "It was scrumptious talking, but we delightfully need to go."

Chrisma: "Ooooo, shit your face! I'm helping this amazing man out!"

Blake: "Oh gross, she even does that unsexy ooo thingy." *He hissed in disgust.*

Karol: "Surpreon is damaged, let's halp." *He skipped towards Ginger.*

Teresa: *She walked with a professional strut towards the glyph.* "Let us assist him now." *She spoke in a stern tone and took a step forward, causing her image to disappear in a flash of purple light.*

----------

Season: *He stared at the destruction of Surpreon with his hands on his waist.* (This will take a lot of hard work-)

Teresa: *Her image appeared next to Season.* "How long do you think this will take?"

Season: "As long as it needs."

Teresa: "Hoh?" *She looked at Season in confusion.* "What kind of answer is that?"

*Lines of people stepped off the glyph and started to walk towards Surpreon.*

Season: *He watched villagers start to sweep the ground and take away the cluttered debris.* (It could take months, even years-)

Lance: "Oi."

Season: *He turned around puzzled.* "Lance?"

Lance: "So-" *He looked to his sides, as the party gathered around him.* "Wat do ya want us to do?" *He smirked and puffed out his chest, sniffing his finger in a cocky manner.*

Season: "Well-" *He looked behind him and pointed to the cracks on the walls.* "Clearing out the clutter, then repairing the cracks."

*Chatter echoed throughout Surpreon, as Scoldrant appearing people, tribe members, dancers and warriors helped each other lift heavy items out of the city.*

Lance: "Got it!-"

Chapter 5: Acceptable My Way

Madora: *The area around her swirled aurora colours.* (I wonder what PKMY has sent me to do-)

*Echoing whirls howled around Madora as brown and black colours mixed with the aurora.*

Madora: *The area started to slowly stop spinning, causing her to look around.* (The overwhelming support to help rebuild Surpreon has been tremendous, even the Valkyrie used spatial Remenistal to help expedite the process.)

*An aurora glyph drew itself on the ground, causing swirls of dirt to spiral in the air.*

Madora: *She smiled in thought.* (Throughout the millennium, I have enjoyed times of peace, but I have never witnessed so many clans uniting in such a manner. Goes to show just how much productivity people can produce when they set aside their differences and focus on one task.)

*The glyph flashed, revealing Madora standing in the middle of the aurora glyph.*

Madora: *Her long black hair flicked high into the air as the glyph dissipated.* (Due to their efforts, the reconstruction of Surpreon has been a complete success.)

*Loud eagle-like squawks echoed in the far distance and warm gusts of wind blew past Madora, gently blowing her hair forward.*

Madora: "Now what did she say?" *She mumbled to herself and looked up, staring at the entrance to Turnback Cave.*

*The rocks on the top of Turnback Cave unnaturally swirled up as if something had erupted out of it.*

Madora: "Everything has been in such good motion, even the preparations of a Battling Oxident had been announced a while back." *She chuckled to herself.* "Come to think of, I believe Battling Oxident is almost upon us."

*The sunlight shined brightly on the landscape and the sounds of Cicadas could be heard.*

Madora: *She walked towards the entrance of Turnback Cave and noticed the statues.* "These are quite peculiar." *She whispered to herself, listening to bat-like screeches echo deep in the cave.*

*Madora elegantly raised her hand and clicked her fingers, causing a large aurora glyph to draw itself on the ground.*

Madora: "Either way, my respect for the party has increased tenfold after the downfall of Ridley. So I don't mind doing tasks like this for them." *She suddenly disappeared in a flash of aurora, leaving behind thick swirls of dirt where the glyph materialised.*

----------

*Several lion-like men carried large boulders through Surpreon and placed them on the outer layer of the city. Chatter was constant and several food stands were available to the workers. The walls were white and the ground was a grey marble. Large brick houses had smoke rising out of chimneys and tall pine-like trees swayed in the breeze.*

PKMY: *She grunted as she pushed a large green polished brick into place.* (Nearly there-) *She leant back, wiping sweat off her forehead in accomplishment.*

Celest: *She walked out of a large house with Locki and looked up, noticing a newly designed sign with the words 'INN' on it.* "The rooms are designed just like Valhalla's."

Locki: "Thy was impressed we replicated it so well."

Celest: *She nodded her head and noticed PKMY standing in a large circle of green polished bricks with three pedestals in the middle.* "Good work, Locki."

Locki: *He looked at Celest, shaking his head.* "No."

Celest: "Locki?"

Locki: "We should share the gratification. Good work."

Celest: "Hmph." *She grunted with respect and focused back to PKMY, making her way towards her.*

PKMY: *She frowned and violently held the Ryukku, carving several glyph-like lines into the stones.* "Grr-"

Celest: "PKMY."

PKMY: "Huh?" *She leant back and sat on her knees, placing her hands against her legs.* "Oh?" *She looked over her shoulder, staring at Celest and Locki.*

Locki: "Perhaps thou should take a break."

PKMY: "I've almost done my part-" *She grunted and raised her arm, pointing the Ryukku in front of her.* "Just a few more lines and the glyph will be completed."

Celest: *She looked over towards a large manor, noticing a large purple glyph on the ground.* "What is that?"

PKMY: "Ah-" *She wiped more sweat off her forehead and inspected the area.* "That's Battling Oxident."

Locki: "Celest, perhaps we should take advantage of this freedom?" *He stared at the glyph in an intrigued manner.*

Celest: "Yes, thy've watched Battling Oxident via the water mirror, but it would be nice to see it firsthand-"

*A flash of aurora lights caused Locki and Celest to step away, catching the nearby people's attention.*

PKMY: "You're late."

Madora: *She stepped off the blinding glyph, as it slowly faded away.* "Oh dear, these were slightly heavier than I thought." *She stepped to the side and revealed three human-shaped statues.*

Celest: "What are they?"

PKMY: "I'd like them to be placed on these pedestals when you're ready."

Madora: *She quickly observed the city.* "Things are looking better every time I come back here."

Locki: "Indeed." *He grunted in agreement.*

Madora: "Where is everyone?"

PKMY: "They're outside the city taking a break."

Celest: "A break?"

PKMY: "Lance, Holland, Alicia, Teresa, Tyler, Pepper and Season all finished the construction of Surpreon's manor and the entrance to the city-" *She nudged her head behind the party, causing them to notice several women walk through the walls into the city.*

Locki: (They've already fixed the entrance-)

PKMY: "With the entrance and the cabin, I can tell you I am over Reality Sekais and Spacial Funnels."

Madora: "Some people don't have the spatial awareness to deal with them."

PKMY: "Eh? I'm too much in a working mood to appreciate those comments."

Madora: "And what about the other party?"

Celest: (The guild?)

PKMY: "They finished the tasks Ginger allocated to them, and now they're focusing on the teleportation glyph to connect the cities together."

Madora: (Ooo, that will be a tough job.)

Celest: "Nevertheless, please get everyone when the sun sets."

PKMY: "Why?"

Celest: "Did thou not desire to try the new cabin?" *She looked over to an extended part of Surpreon and stared at a large wooden house.*

PKMY: "Heh."

Madora: "I think you should take your own advice, take a break. You look exhausted."

PKMY: "Tssk, just a little more and-"

Madora: "I can move these statues with the help of Locki and Celest."

Locki: "Thy see no problem with that."

PKMY: *She looked at Madora, Celest and Locki and looked away feeling peer pressured.* "Alright, I'll have a break." *She rolled her eyes and stepped out of the ring, placing the Ryukkus behind her waist.*

Madora: *She watched the Ryukkus warp and fade before focusing her attention on Celest.* "Celest, is there a feast or some sort of celebration happening after sunset?"

Celest: "Yes."

Madora: "Oh, I guess an old person like me wasn't invited-"

Celest: "Do not be ridiculous, of course, thou're welcome."

PKMY: (Blah, old people conversations-) *She shivered and faced the exit to the city.* "Right-"

Madora: "Have fun, deary." *She chuckled, glancing at PKMY in the corner of her eye.*

PKMY: "Wateva." *She grunted with respect and flashstepped out of the city.*

Locki: *He smiled and stepped into the ring, walking past Madora towards the statues.* "Hmm?" *He stared at the statues with golden eyes, running his finger along one of them.*

Madora: "Shall we get started?" *She smiled and clapped her hands, looking at Celest.*

Locki: *He stepped away from the statues, glancing at Madora.* "These eyes, thou realise these statues are-?"

Madora: "Indeed I do, deary."

Celest: "Did she want them in any particular order?"

Madora: "No, dear." *She smiled and faced the statues with a large sigh.*

PKMY: *Her arms swayed behind her back, as the area blurred past her.* (Everyone's worked their asses off-)

*PKMY's image suddenly appeared on the shore, causing an eruption of sand to wave around her.*

Holland: *He sat on the sand with his arms behind his back.* "Huh?" *He instantly noticed PKMY, causing him to smile.* "Amy."

PKMY: *She smiled and walked up to him.* "Where is everyone?"

Holland: *He looked away with a smirk.* "Don't know, you might kick me out of the city again."

PKMY: *She smirked and plunked herself next to him.* "I could feel how exhausted you all were, so shut it, you feral ogre."

Holland: "Oh? Nice try, trying to make me feel better."

PKMY: *She grabbed Holland's arm and rested her head against it.* "I'm tired."

Holland: "Too bad-"

Lance: "Rawrr!" *He jumped out of the bushes behind Holland and threw a wet ball of sand at PKMY.*

PKMY: *She hunched forward as the sand splattered over her back.* "You-"

Tyler: *He staggered out of the bushes and threw two handfuls of wet sand at PKMY.* "Haha!"

PKMY: *Her eyebrow twitched in anger.* "You little shits!-"

Alicia: *She ran out of the bushes and past Holland, throwing wet sand balls at him.* "Harh!"

Holland: "Argh, what-?" *He mumbled with frustration.*

Teresa: "Humph." *Her image appeared in the air above PKMY and Holland.* "Hmph-" *She threw four sand balls downwards, exploding them on PKMY and Holland's head.*

PKMY: "Grr-" *She gritted her teeth, growling with growing anger.*

Teresa: *She elegantly landed on the sand and started to directly walk towards the shore.* "Direct hit."

PKMY: "Wat is going on?!" *She stared at Teresa's back and stood up in anger, raising her fists.*

Holland: *He rubbed sand out of his hair with a smirk.* (The plan was to only get Amy-)

PKMY: "Lance, Tyler, you two are my first targets!" *She watched the entire party run towards the water.*

Lance: "Shit, it's happenin' just as we planned!"

Tyler: "R-Right." *He squealed in understanding, intensely staring at the water.*

Destiny: *She dived out of the bushes and flapped her wings, gliding towards Lance and Tyler.* "Meehehehe." *She galloped across the sand and lowered her neck, picking Tyler up from in between the legs.*

Tyler: "Ah-" *He awkwardly grabbed Destiny's mane, pulling an awkward face in fear.*

Lance: *He looked over his shoulder and smirked, watching Destiny gallop behind him.* "Ah-" *He jumped back and landed in front of Tyler on Destiny's back.*

Tyler: "Ah, watch it! I nearly fell off-"

PKMY: "You're all gonna get it!" *She screamed and ignored chunks of sand falling off one side of her face.*

Lance: "I'd be more worried about her!" *He grunted with a fixated smile on his face.*

PKMY: "And why are you all in your undergarments!" *She shouted in disgust and took several steps forward, dragging her feet through the sand.*

Alicia: "Tee hee-" *She giggled as radiant silver wings erupted out of her back.*

Teresa: *She half smirked.* "It appears we have effectively taunted the enemy!" *She yelled out to the party, as white wings erupted out from her back.*

Destiny: *She flapped her wings and flew above the glistening water's surface.* "Mee hee."

Tyler: (We're in the air!-)

Lance: *He looked down at his reflection and placed his hand into the water, causing a line of water to spray past Destiny.* "Kool-"

Tyler: *He leant to one side, watching the water sprinkle past him.* "W-Watch it."

*Teresa and Alicia blasted across the water and flew next to Destiny.*

PKMY: *She stamped her foot and looked at Holland.* "They're all flying, this isn't fair!-"

Season: *He hobbled out of the bushes and waved his arm, causing a wave of sand to crash on top of PKMY.* "Oh, watch your step, you two." *He laughed and ran onto the shore, as the water swirled and bent to his will.*

PKMY: *She grunted in rage, causing her face to light up a bright red colour.* (When I get my hands on them, including Teresa and Alicia-)

Holland: *He stood up and smirked as a purple glyph spiralled in front of him.* "Then we'll have to fly too."

PKMY: "Eh?"

Freya: *She pounced out of the glyph and slid across the sand.* (I saw what happened-) *Her body tripled in size and she extended her wings.* (Let's get them!)

PKMY: *She smirked with enthusiasm.* "Now she's talking!" *She grabbed Holland's hand and stepped forward, pulling him towards Freya.*

Holland: "I'm sitting on the fron-"

PKMY: "I'm on front!" *She smirked as if she knew what Holland was going to say.*

Freya: (Quickly get on, they're making distance-) *She bent down, preparing to carry PKMY and Holland.*

PKMY: *She hopped on Freya's back and stared at the party, as their image started to become dots in the distance.* "They are getting far-"

Holland: "You haven't seen how fast Freya can really fly." *He hopped on Freya's back and placed his hands around PKMY's waist.*

PKMY: "I've seen her in Battling Oxident-"

*Freya blasted high into the air, causing a large pulse of sand to erupted when she stood.*

Teresa: *She looked behind her past the trail of water and noticed Freya flapping directly towards them.* "Everyone, be on guard!"

Tyler: "Haha!" *He squealed with excitement.*

Alicia: "Should we scatter?" *Her hair and pendant rapidly flapped behind her.*

Season: "That's a feasible plan." *He rode on a large wave, glancing at Alicia.*

Lance: "We thought we lost ya for a moment!"

Season: "Hohoho, don't be foolish." *He smirked and continuously looked behind him.* "Freya is fast, isn't she?!"

Tyler: *He held Lance by the waist and looked behind him.* "Oh no!" *He yelled and looked to his side at the party.* "They're getting closer!"

PKMY: *Her hair rapidly flapped across her forehead.* "Freya, I want you to swerve a little and use the momentum to sideswipe them, does that make sense?"

Freya: (Use the speed of a dive and tilt at an angle, hitting them with my wing?)

PKMY: "Yes! Yahoo!" *She grinned with anger as she slowly approached the party.*

Teresa: "Everyone, scatter formation!"

Lance: "Don't tell me, sista!"

Teresa: "We are not of blood relations?"

Lance: *He ignored Teresa, gently kicking Destiny on her sides.* "Come on, horsey!"

Destiny: "Meeheeheehee." *She hunched forward and flapped her wings, causing her to blast straight up into the air.*

Tyler: "Woooo." *He screamed with excitement and fear.*

Lance: "Ahaha, dude you're screamin' in my ear!"

Alicia: "Tee hee." *She looked up with a smile, watching Destiny, Lance and Tyler fly towards the clouds.* "Teresa?"

Teresa: *She slowly rattled to each side, causing her to shake in mid-air.* "It appears I am not used to these wings."

Alicia: "Tee hee." *She held Teresa's hand and her wings moved like razor blades, causing her to fly at a faster speed.*

Teresa: *She noticed Alicia's wings, causing her to gasp in thought.* (There are different speed levels? Impressive-)

Season: *He watched Alicia and Teresa fly into the air.* "Don't worry about me!" *He continued to ride the wave by himself.*

PKMY: "I'll be leaving no witnesses! Hehehe!" *She screamed and laughed like a maniac.*

Holland: (Haha, she's really into it, isn't she-?)

Freya: (I like it.) "Gruff!" *She focused her eyesight on Season and flapped her wings at an angle.* (Your first victim, Amy.)

PKMY: "Yea!"

*Freya flew into striking distance, causing PKMY's evil smirk to widen.*

Season: *He looked over his shoulder and gasped.* "No-"

PKMY: "Bwahaha." *Freya swooped to the side and clipped Season with her wing.*

Season: "Farewell, friends!-" *He tripped on the wave and tumbled across the water like a stepping stone.* "Argh-" *He wheezed, slowly sinking into the water.*

Teresa: *She looked behind her, causing her hair to blow across her face.* (PKMY shifted Season's footing, causing him to trip on his own Rasticsplash, quite impressive.)

Holland: "That's one!"

PKMY: "Yahoo!"
Freya: "Arhwooo."

Lance: "Shit, did you see how she totally just owned Season!"

Tyler: "N-No, I was looking in front-"

Lance: "There-" *He pointed to the ripples in the water, showing how far Season was knocked across the water.*

Tyler: "Eek-" *He closed his eyes in fear and excitement.* "Higher!"

Lance: *He smirked and leant on a side to see Destiny's head.* "You heard him."

Destiny: "Meeheehee." *She flapped slightly harder and faster, causing them to ascend higher.*

PKMY: "Who should be next?" *She grinned evil-like and looked to her left at Alicia and Teresa.*

Holland: "Get the girls!" *He had a flashback of being hit by sand-balls thrown by them.*

PKMY: "Right!" *She leant at an angle, causing Freya to tilt her right wing up.*

Holland: (Ever since Amy learnt how to connect her abilities through the power of a Soul Link-) *He smirked in thought, admiring PKMY and Freya's teamwork.* (-Those two seemed to have bonded beyond my comprehension.)

Teresa: *She glanced at Alicia, struggling to keep a steady flight.* "I wish to announce, Season is down! I repeat, Season is down!"

Alicia: "Oh no!" *She quickly scanned the sky behind her and noticed Freya, ignoring her flapping hair and pendant.* "A-And it looks like we're next!"

Teresa: "Hoh?"

Alicia: "They're flying after us."

Teresa: "Any strategic plans?"

Alicia: "N-No, you?"

Teresa: "Indeed. We maintain enough speed until PKMY flies into striking distance."

Alicia: "Yep."

Teresa: "Then, by using the correct amount of Astragons, we spiral up for a split encounter-" *The tips of large waves clipped her toes, causing bursts of water to spray behind her.* "Then we counterattack."

Alicia: *She looked to her side, staring at Teresa with a blank expression.* "U-Umm, yes."

Teresa: "I believe doing that will give us a chance to win."

Alicia: (Spiral above for a split encounter? What am I meant to do?)

Teresa: "Are you ready?" *She stared in front with determination, causing her hair to swirl above her.*

Alicia: *She admired Teresa's beauty.* "Yes, I'm ready."

Teresa: "Excellent-"

PKMY: "Bwarh!" *She suddenly dived down and landed on top of Alicia's back, causing an eruption of water to blast in Teresa's face.*

Alicia: *She blew out bubbles and looked up, slowly swimming to the surface.* (She was following us, when did she have the time to get above us?!)

Teresa: *She looked to her side in shock, awkwardly swaying away from the explosion.* (She dived from the sky and tackled Alicia into the ocean! I did not predict she would jump off Freya!-)

Alicia: "Arh-" *She inhaled deeply and wiped her nose, looking at Teresa.* "Fly, Teresa!"

Teresa: "Affirmative!"

PKMY: "Heh." *She popped her head up next to Alicia, smirking in an evil-like manner.*

Alicia: "Tee hee, make sure you get Lance big time. It was his idea."

PKMY: (Oh, it was? That's a shock!) *She squinted her eyes in excitement, answering Alicia with her facial expressions.* (Freya! Holly!-)

Holland: (We hear you!)

Freya: *She glided above the water and nicked her legs in the ocean, causing sudden spurts of water to splash behind her.* (Brace yourself-)

PKMY: *She raised her arm and spread her fingers, allowing Holland to grab her hand.* "Yea-"

Holland: "Nice idea by jumping off Freya."

PKMY: "Heh." *She nodded her head and looked at Teresa, ignoring the water dripping off her face.* "You're next!"

Teresa: "Hoh?"

Freya: *She blasted towards Teresa and easily caught up to her.* "Gruff!"

Teresa: *She glanced behind her and gasped in shock, quickly focusing ahead in determination.* "Tcch."

PKMY: *She smirked as Freya tailgated Teresa through the air.* (Heh.)

Holland: (She's surprisingly slow.)

Freya: (She's only recently unlocked her ability to fly, I wasn't this fast either, remember?)

Teresa: (Stick to the plan.) *She thought to herself, ignoring the danger behind her.*

PKMY: (Heheh, almost-) *She leant forward and reached out, as Teresa's legs slowly drifted into reaching distance.*

Teresa: "Humph-" *She curved her back and unnaturally spiralled backwards, twirling above and over Freya.*

Freya: "Grarh?" *She looked up in shock, causing her smooth glide to wobble.*
PKMY: "Eh?" *She looked up, frowning in a competitive manner.*

Alicia: (So that's what she meant! I could've done that if she didn't word the sentence so strangely.)

Holland: (Did she purposely allow us to catch up, or did she use her lack of speed as an advantage?)

Teresa: *She flew behind Freya, causing her to half smirk.* "It appears I am now chasing after you-"

PKMY: "Nah!" *She stood up and the wind pushed her on to Holland, causing him to smirk.* "I'll get you as I did to the princess!"

Teresa: "Hoh? Do you think you can?"

PKMY: "Heh." *She jumped above Holland and tapped his shoulder with her toe, pushing herself towards Teresa.*

Teresa: "Such a frontal dive is easily avoidable-" *She swayed to one side, watching PKMY dive past her.*

PKMY: "Shit-" *She grunted, crashing into the water below.*

Holland: (You know what to do?)

Freya: (Yes.) *She flapped her wings and suddenly flew on a side.*

Teresa: "Hmph." *She stared at the splash and smirked, grunting with satisfaction.*

Holland: "Sorry." *Freya hovered in the air, causing Teresa to look in front startled.*

Teresa: "Harh-?" *She slammed into the side of Freya.*

Holland: *He scratched behind Freya's ear.* (You alright?)

Freya: (Didn't feel anything.)

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She slowly fell towards the ocean and splashed into the water.*

Lance: *He looked down, watching from high in the air.* "Looks like it's just us left."

Tyler: *He looked down and gasped.* "W-We should descend!"

Lance: "Wat, why?!"

Tyler: "What if she knocks us off Destiny and we plummet from this height!"

Lance: "The fall would be nothin', aye, we got that Astragong shield thingy-"

Tyler: "But.."

Lance: "But wat?!" *He grunted in an annoyed manner.*

Tyler: "But.. I'm not strong like you all.. My body doesn't generate the epithelial field of Astragons."

Lance: *He thought to himself in realisation.* (Shit, he's right-)

PKMY: *She reached up and giggled.* (Excellent-)

Holland: *He helped PKMY back onto Freya.* "Next-" *He spoke with a smile, wrapping his arms around her waist.*

PKMY: *She looked up, smirking with anger.* "The try hard and teacher's pet are left."

Freya: "Growlff." *She flapped her wings and flew across the water.*

Teresa: *She pushed herself up and stood on the water.* (Tcch, that was slightly enjoyable-)

*Alicia and Season rode on a wave and stood on the water next to Teresa.*

Season: "All aboard, hohoho." *He chuckled and swayed his arms, causing the wave to expand underneath Teresa.*

Alicia: (Even though I can fly, I still find it amazing how Teresa can stand on the water like that.)

Holland: "Freya, pick up the speed."

PKMY: "Yea, the faster we go, the faster I'll wrap my hands around that shit's neck." *She pretended to choke the air, causing her to smile.*

Freya: "Gruowlth!" *Her wings extended and she flapped harder.* (Brace yourselves!-) *She suddenly soared through the air directly towards Destiny, blasting a wave of air behind her.*

*Holland and PKMY slightly leant back, due to the speed Freya flew at.*

PKMY: (Now this is flying!) *She unintentionally giggled like a girl, causing Holland to smirk and tighten his grip around her waist.*

Tyler: *He watched Freya soar through the air with widening eyes.* "Eek!"

Lance: "Huh?! Oh shi-?!" *He yelled and pushed forward, causing Destiny to quickly swoop downwards.*

Freya: *She flew past Destiny and her tail nicked Tyler on the head.* (Missed.)

Tyler: (She touched me!) *He squealed in thought, unintentionally digging his nails into Lance's waist.*

Destiny: *She wobbled and flew on a side, due to the force of Freya's strike.* (That was close.)

Lance: "Crap, that's so unfair!-"

Freya: *She flapped her wings and spiralled upwards, suddenly floating in the air.* (Quickly recover your balance-) *She spoke to PKMY and Holland as she faced Destiny.*

PKMY: (Damn right!-) *She wiggled her bottom, adjusting herself more comfortably.*

Lance: (Freya can like, fly in circles around us-)

Tyler: "We're doomed!" *He squealed with fear.*

Lance: "Dude, I'm not your bitch, watch the nails, aye."

Tyler: "S-Sorry."

PKMY: "My victims, don't fret, you'll soon be eaten by the salty waters!" *She purposely spoke like a witch as she pointed at the ocean below.*

Lance: "Aha, your voice finally suits your appearance-"

PKMY: "Wat!?" *She yelled in anger.*

Tyler: "St-Stop taunting her!"

Lance: "Come on, dive downwards, I've got a plan."

Destiny: (Got it-) *She thought to herself.* "Meeheeehee."

Tyler: "You? A plan? We're doomed!" *He squealed in terror.*

Holland: (We're good, Freya.)

Freya: *She flapped her wings to keep herself afloat.* (Okay-) *She looked down and tilted her head, blasting towards Destiny.*

Lance: *He looked behind him and noticed Freya, causing him to inhale deeply.* "Alright-"

Holland: (Nearly there-)

PKMY: *Freya flew into striking distance, causing her to lean up.* (I'll show you to throw sand at me!-)

Lance: "Now, zigzag on the ocean's surface!"

Holland: "Huh?" *He watched Destiny suddenly dive at a steeper angle.*

PKMY: "No! Don't let my victims escape!" *Her words caused Freya to dive down after Destiny.*

Tyler: "W-Why are we going to zigzag?!" *He spoke awkwardly, watching them dive towards the water.*

Lance: "You're the nerd, why don't ya figure it out?"

Tyler: "No, we're going to cra-ash!"

Destiny: *She violently flapped her wings and water erupted on each side, as she forced herself to a complete stop above the water's surface.* "Meeheehee."

Tyler: "Oh my gosh!" *He quickly squealed in shock, ignoring his frizzed up hair.*

Destiny: "Meehehe!" *She flapped several times and flew across the water, causing Lance to smirk.*

Freya: *An explosion of water blasted all around her, as she shot across the water.* (My aerial skills are superior to Destiny's.)

Tyler: *He looked behind him and noticed Freya slowly gaining speed.* (Freya didn't even stop-)

Holland: *He smiled as they flew out of the explosion of water.* (Perfect skills, Freya.)

Tyler: *He had flashbacks of each party member in the water, causing him to panic.* "N-No, I can't do it!"

Lance: "Can't do wat-?"

Tyler: "Farewell, friends-" *He let go of Lance and flew back, off Destiny.*

PKMY: "Heh." *She smirked, watching Tyler skim past her across the water.*

Lance: "Damn, it's just us-"

Destiny: *She started to zigzag across the water, causing spurts of water to erupt on each side she zigzagged on.* "Meehee."

Freya: *Spurts of water splashed in her face.* (The water is stinging my eyes-)

Lance: *He looked behind him with curiosity.* "Aha, sucked in. Lance for final villain!" *He laughed, as he focused his attention back in front of him.*

PKMY: "That idiot somehow found a strategy!"

Holland: "I guess we'll have to cheat."

PKMY: "Cheat?"

Holland: "For you-" *He mumbled and leant forward with a smirk, looking at Freya.*

PKMY: (How?)

Holland: "Ougi."

Freya: "Gruff." *She showed her teeth, giving the illusion she was smirking.*

Holland: "Brace yourself."

PKMY: "Yea." *She tensed her legs and arms.*

Lance: "Guess I'm just too good for you-" *He looked behind him and gasped in shock.* "Where-?"

Freya: *She flashstepped in front and hit Destiny with her wing, causing Destiny to instantly disintegrate away.* "Gruff."

Lance: *He stared at PKMY in shock as he fell towards the water in slow motion.* "Noooo!"

PKMY: "Ahahahaha."

Holland: *He smirked and watched Lance crash into the water.* "Revenge completed?"

PKMY: "Not quite."

Holland: "Oh?"

PKMY: "Sorry, babe."

Holland: "Huh?"

PKMY: *She smirked and looked at Holland.* "You know, I was able to quickly read something while we were chasing after my victims." *She leant to the side and reached up, rubbing Holland's neck in a caring manner.*

Holland: "Yeah?" *He mumbled in a deep voice, enjoying the neck rubbing.*

PKMY: "How you were part of the plan."

Holland: "Huh?" *He quickly gasped, as if his cover was blown.*

PKMY: "Yea-" *She pushed Holland to the side and watched him fall off Freya.*

Holland: "No!" *He shouted with a smile, bracing himself to hit the water.*

PKMY: "Now, my revenge is completed!" *She raised her arms above her head in a victorious manner.* "Who else is happy?"

Freya: "Ruff!" *She roared out a bark in agreement.*

PKMY: "If any one of you do that again-" *She pointed down at the party, who rode on Season's wave.* "Then you'll have another thing-" *Several balls of sand hit her in the back of the head.* "Wat?!"

Pepper: "I say-" *She blasted past PKMY at an incredible speed.*

*Freya and PKMY leant forward due to the sudden rush of air.*

Pepper: "Continuous threats lose their value after repetitiveness." *She soared across the ocean towards the shore in the far distance.*

PKMY: "Get her!"

Freya: (Certainly-) *She quickly faced Pepper and pounced forward, flashstepping into her general direction.*

Pepper: *She looked back with her golden eyes and smirked.* (Freya is able to not only flashstep, but in mid-air too-) *She suddenly blasted directly up, causing a pulse-like wave to swirl on the water.*

Freya: *She flew out of her flashstep and flapped her wings, turning around to face Pepper.* "Gruff-"

PKMY: "Haha-" *She spread her arms and smirked with a frown, readying herself to catch Pepper.* "Where-?"

Freya: (She's gone?)

PKMY: "Didn't you flashstep directly in front of her?"

Freya: (I did-?)

Pepper: "I say, up here!"

PKMY: "Huh?" *She looked up and noticed Pepper flying towards the clouds.*

Freya: (I won't let her escape-) *She flashstepped upwards, causing an explosion of water to ripple where she hovered.*

Pepper: "I say, remarkable speed yeah?" *She flicked her legs, causing her to spiral to one side.*

Freya: "Grr-" *She flashstepped above, in the direction where Pepper flew.*

Pepper: "A little slow-"

Freya: *She glanced to her side as Pepper flew past at incredible speeds.* (How is she dodging us before we even step out of-?)

PKMY: *She looked up, staring at Pepper with a competitive frown.* (Doesn't matter-)

Pepper: "Hmph." *She smirked and came to a sudden stop, causing her long hair to flap above her.*

PKMY: (Alright, it's a big risk, but let's try this-) *She stood up and flashstepped off Freya.*

Pepper: *She spun around and looked down, staring at Freya with widening eyes.* "Where did-?"

PKMY: *She flashstepped behind Pepper and grabbed her from behind.* "Heh-"

Pepper: "How-?" *She gasped in shock and looked down, staring at PKMY's arms.*

PKMY: "I knew chasing you wouldn't have been an option, so-" *She spoke as if it was obvious what she did instead.*

Pepper: "I say, I underestimated you."

PKMY: "Yahoo-" *She flicked her leg and they started to spiral.*

Pepper: "Ah-?" *She hair spiralled around her head and her wings disintegrated.* "I say-"

PKMY: "Then say it." *She grinned evil-like and kicked herself off Pepper.*

Pepper: (I failed?) *She thought to herself in shock as she spiralled towards the water.*

PKMY: "Looks like it!" *She started to fall, alerting Freya.*

Freya: *She flapped her wings and swooped underneath PKMY, catching her on her back.* "Growlith!"

PKMY: "Awesome save! I didn't hurt you, did I?"

Freya: (No, I'm still in my Ancioldrant form.)

PKMY: *She sighed in relief and scratched Freya behind the ears.* "Let's meet them on the shore and see if they dare throw any more at me."

Freya: "Ruff." *She floated in the air, causing the strong sea breeze to blow against her fur.*

Pepper: "I say, it looks like I've been defeated-"

PKMY: *She looked down and watched a small splash ripple in the water.* "Heh, there goes Pepper."

Freya: "Gruff!"

PKMY: "Alright, I'm over it." *She spoke with a satisfying sigh and pet Freya, causing her to slowly descend towards the shore.*

Pepper: *She popped up on the surface and spat out a stream of water.* "Argh-"

Season: *He rode a wave with Alicia, Teresa, Tyler, Lance and Holland.* "Hello, Pepper."

Lance: "Good news, we're acceptin' passengers on the Season express!"

Season: "Hohoho." *He chuckled and bent down to help Pepper up.*

Pepper: *Season pulled her up out of the water and onto his, causing her to stare at it in amazement.* "How? Am I standing on the water?"

Tyler: "Season's pretty amazing-" *He stamped his foot on the water.* "It's solid."

Lance: *He scrubbed his hair to dry it.* "She got us good, aye."

Holland: "Haha, sure did."

Teresa: *She slightly bent down and wrung water out of her hair, staring at Holland.* "I was not expecting her to turn against you."

Alicia: "Y-Yeah, weren't you going to tell her at the end?"

Holland: "She used her empathic powers."

Lance: "Lame."

Holland: "Haha, it certainly caught me off guard."

Season: *He smiled with concentration as he pushed the wave towards the shore.* "Besides being wet, it went according to plan."

Pepper: "It did." *She mumbled in a deep voice and smiled in satisfaction.*

Freya: *She straightened her legs and flapped her wings, causing gusts of sand to blow away.* "Awroo." *She landed on the shore and howled with victory.*

PKMY: *She sighed and faced the ocean with a smirk.* "I think we make a good team." *Her words caused Freya to wag her tail in agreement.*

Freya: *She turned around and watched the party step onto the sand as her body slowly shrunk in size.* (I think we make a good team too.)

Alicia: *She quickly skipped up to PKMY and hugged her.* "I'm sorry!"

PKMY: "Hehe, don't worry about it."

Lance: "Yea, she got us back epically."

PKMY: "Sure did."

Teresa: "She surprised us."

PKMY: "I know."

Season: "She didn't hesitate and got us almost instantaneously."

PKMY: "Really? Cool."

Holland: "Even foresaw the hidden villain."

PKMY: "I certainly did."

Pepper: "And I say, she incorporated Freya's mid-air flashstepping ability."

PKMY: "Pretty smart."

Tyler: "And she filled us up with fear and excitement, I nearly wet my pants."

PKMY: "Oh yeah-"

Lance: "Wait-"

PKMY: "Wat?"

Tyler: "I arh-umm, nothing."

Season: "Phew, after such excitement nearly the whole day has passed." *He placed his hands on his waist and leant back to crack his back.*

Pepper: "I think we deserved that time of fun, yeah?"

Lance: "Yea."

Holland: *His stomach rumbled which cued Tyler an idea.* "I'm hungry."

PKMY: "You're always hungry." *She smirked and walked up to him.*

Freya: "Ruff." *She flapped her little wings and jumped up onto PKMY's shoulder.*

Tyler: "Well it's nearing sunset, so I better plan the feast."

PKMY: "Sunset?" *She looked up in thought.* "Oh, we better head back to Surpreon."

Lance: "Pretty sure we were goin' there anyways."

PKMY: "Pretty sure, we could've spent a little longer on the sand."

Teresa: "Precisely."

Lance: "Wateva, just go on then."

Tyler: "Do you mean, more resting on the sand or Surpreon?"

Lance: "Surpreon, your highness." *He grunted and motioned the party forward, cueing them to slowly start walking.*

Pepper: "Who else is tired, yeah?"

PKMY: "Of Lance? Yea."

Lance: "Oi-"

Alicia: "Tee hee, don't be mean to him."

Lance: "Yea, look who's finally on Lance's side."

PKMY: "Wateva." *She rolled her eyes.*

Tyler: *He looked at Pepper, nodding his head.* "I am."

Holland: "I'm a little beat too." *He mumbled, placing his hands behind his head.*

Lance: "I'd be lyin' if I said the excitement hasn't worn me out a little." *He placed his hands on his head like a child.*

Alicia: "Me too, tee hee." *She bit her bottom lip in excitement.*

PKMY: "I'd say it's more satisfying than tiring." *She walked through the forest, grinning in an evil-like manner.*

Tyler: *He stepped over small sticks to avoid them from crunching.* "I-If it's possible, nobody goes into the kitchen area."

Season: "Not even me?" *He spoke with a gasp, pretending to be shocked.*

Tyler: "N-Nope."

Holland: "Oh, how come?"

Tyler: "Because I'm cooking a surprise."

Holland: *He quickly lowered his hands and rubbed them in excitement.* "Now you're talking."

Freya: "Gruff!" *She wagged her tail in excitement.*

PKMY: *She smirked and paused in realisation, causing her to frown.* (This isn't my excitement-) *She looked at Holland.* "I can't believe how excited you get over food."

Holland: "Haha, whatever."

PKMY: *She frowned with a childish smirk.* "Heh." *She focused her attention back in front.* "Well, Tyler, I've got a surprise too."

Tyler: "Oh?"

PKMY: "Well actually, it's more directed for Season."

Season: "Oh really? What is it?"

PKMY: "Err-"

Lance: "Then it wouldn't be a surprise." *He rolled his eyes.*

Season: "Oh my, yes, you're quite right, ho ho ho."

Teresa: "A surprise?" *She spoke with complete confusion.*

Tyler: "You know, a surprise?" *He awkwardly tried to explain it.*

Lance: "Perfect explanation, Tyler." *He sarcastically clapped his hands.*

Tyler: "I-I don't know."

Alicia: "Well, doing something that catches people off guard."

Teresa: "Oh? Similar to when in combat, the opponent uses a technique that catches you off guard?" *Silence filled the party.*

Pepper: "Well, yes." *She raised her hand and flicked one of her ponytails over her shoulder.*

Teresa: "Hmm?" *She mumbled in thought.*

PKMY: "Well, we're almost there." *She stepped into the clearing and noticed Surpreon's new white outer shell.*

Season: "Excellent-"

PKMY: "Alright, let me go check and see if it's ready!" *She turned around and faced the party before flashstepping out of sight.*

Holland: (Get some rest-) *He reached out and watched Freya glide towards his arm before disintegrating into nothing.*

Teresa: "Tyler, what exactly would you consider, a surprise?"

Tyler: "Umm-" *He placed his hands near his shoulder by habit, as if he was holding the RPG bag.* "Well, like someone baking the party a cake larger than a person."

Holland: "That would be awesome." *He smirked, implying he liked the idea.*

Pepper: "Someone being able to fly with me." *She giggled at Alicia and Teresa.*

Alicia: "Someone saying they umm-" *She nervously looked down.* "Saying they liked you."

Season: (Oh young love.)

Lance: "I may not be Tyler, but since we all decided to answer. Wat would be shockin' for me, would be seein' Alicia dance, Pepper fart, or hearin' you sing." *He chuckled at himself like a child.*

Teresa: "Hoh?"

Alicia: "Lance." *She sounded annoyed.*

Tyler: "Tssk-" *He sighed at Lance.*

Lance: "Wat?" *He looked at the party with innocent confusion.*

Season: *He shook his head and rolled his eyes.* "Considering the continuous hard work we put into restoring Surpreon, I want this evening to be filled with laughter."

Lance: "Wharh? Say wat?"

Pepper: "What?" *She innocently answered Lance's question.*

Lance: "N-No-" *He grunted at Pepper and stopped.* "Wateva."

Holland: "You mean, just to have a relaxing one?"

Season: "Yes."

Tyler: "But I still got filing-"

Season: "No paperwork tonight okay, Tyler?"

Tyler: ".. F-Fine." *He looked down, hesitantly nodding his head in agreement.*

Teresa: "That indeed sounds reasonable."

Alicia: "Yep, tee hee."

----------

PKMY: *She flashstepped in front of the inn and instantly noticed the statues on the pedestals.* (Perfect-)

*PKMY smirked in a proud manner and stepped forward, flashstepping directly in front of the statues.*

PKMY: *She took a deep breath and bent down, placing one hand behind her waist.* "Alright-"

*Celest and Locki walked out of the cabin with smiles, casually walking towards the statues.*

Celest: *She noticed PKMY with a Ryukku carving lines in the pedestals under the statues.* "PKMY?"

Locki: *He faced PKMY, quickly glancing around.* "Where is everyone?"

PKMY: "Give me a moment-" *She stuck her tongue out and scratched the Ryukku to the side, connecting the last line.* "There-"

*PKMY smiled and placed the Ryukku in her mouth before backflipping out of the circle of bricks.*

Celest: *She walked up to PKMY and stared at the statues in confusion.* "When we assisted Madora with the statues, we noticed thou were engraving a glyph."

PKMY: "Yea." *She muffled her words, taking the Ryukku out of her mouth.* "I asked Season for the glyph and he unintentionally assisted me."

Locki: "Thy don't understand?"

Celest: (Neurons?) *She looked to the side, watching the glyphs shine blue.*

PKMY: *She watched water suddenly spurt out from the middle, causing her to punch the air in a victorious manner.* "Yahoo!"

Locki: "A water fountain?" *He looked down, noticing the ring of bricks.* "Why didn't thy see this before?"

PKMY: (It looks even better than I thought.) *She smiled with accomplishment and leant back, twirling the Ryukku with her finger.*

Celest: "Can you use water? Thy find that element very interesting to watch."

PKMY: "Nope."

Locki: "If this is not your affinity, then how?"

PKMY: "Heh, that's why I got one of Tyler's Rosterology devices-" *She paused and scratched sand out of her hair.* "Then I implanted those devices, in several of the stone bricks."

Celest: "Oh?"

PKMY: "And combined with one of Season's glyphs, resulted in this."

Locki: (A combination of crafting and Remenistal.. How intelligent-)

PKMY: *She placed the Ryukku to her side, causing it to warp and become invisible.* (They should be here shortly.)

Celest: "Good work, PKMY."

PKMY: "Thanks, I'll be back-" *She looked behind her and noticed the party walking through the entrance, causing the walls to ripple like water.* (Too bad if I wasn't ready yet-)

Teresa: "I am intrigued to know what this surprise is."

Season: "You're not the only one." *He sounded as if he was smiling.*

Lance: *The sounds of the water fountain caught his attention.* "Well, the surprise stands out like dog balls."

Tyler: "What does-?"

PKMY: *She flashstepped in front of the party and smiled victoriously.* "Well-" *She stepped to the side and pointed at the water fountain.*

Alicia: "Wow-"

Tyler: "I always thought Surpreon needed a water fountain." *He spoke with a smile as if he was happy with the surprise.*

Lance: "Why?" *He gave Tyler a strange look.*

Tyler: "It soothes the mind."

Lance: "Huh?"

Teresa: *She had flashbacks of the water fountain in The Lost City.* "The sounds of water induces better mentality."

PKMY: "It's a smart person thing."

Lance: "Oh, you're hilarious."

Season: "..." *He paused, silently staring at the statues with widening eyes.*

Holland: "Amy said this was directed at you, Season?"

Season: "A-Are they what I think-?"

PKMY: "Y-Yea."

Season: ".. Thank you." *He glanced at PKMY and walked up to her, giving her a tight hug.*

Lance: "Ooo, someone has a new admirer!"

Teresa: *She noticed Lupton, Chrisma and Joy walk out of the inn.* "They are siblings." *She whispered to Lance before walking towards the inn.*

Lance: "They're wat?!"

Pepper: "Siblings."

Lance: *He sighed and leant forward, face palming at Pepper.* "Yeah, thanks, Angler."

Pepper: "Any time." *She smiled, causing Lance to sigh again.*

Alicia: "Where are you going, Teresa?"

Teresa: "I will join the party before or during the feast." *She continued to walk ahead.*

Celest: *She walked with Locki towards the party.* "Thy'm glad PKMY brought thou all before sunset."

Pepper: "How come, yeah?"

Celest: "We wanted to let thou know that we'll be having the feast inside the new cabin."

Lance: "Kool." *He muttered to himself.*

Season: (I haven't actually been in there since they added the flooring.)

Locki: "Thy also wanted to ask, who would like to help me-?"

Lance: "Nope."

PKMY: "How about let him finish?" *She grunted past Season at Lance.*

Lance: "How 'bout let 'em finish.." *He grumbled in a childish tone.*

PKMY: "Why you-"

Pepper: "I will, yeah." *She smiled at Locki.*

Locki: "Pepper.." *He spoke under his breath, looking at her with a widening smile.*

Celest: "There is another reason why thy gathered thou all here, thy wish to discuss the possibility of making Valhalla accessible to the public." *Her words caused the entire party to look at her in shock.*

Locki: *He looked to the side, watching Teresa stop in front of Lupton, Joy and Chrisma.* "Should we wait for her?"

PKMY: "I can let her know."

Celest: "Excellent, please come this way." *She turned around and started to walk towards the cabin.*

-

Joy: "What is it, Terra?"

Teresa: "I wish to do something-.." *She spoke with uncertainty, catching Joy's attention.*

Joy: "Oh my, speak of it?"

-

Season: *He watched the party walk past him as they closely followed Celest.* "Amy, thank you."

PKMY: *She chuckled as if she was surprised by his continuous appreciation.* "Caesar, you big buffoon, you're my older brother-"

Season: "Oh be quiet." *He smiled and hugged her again.*

PKMY: *She closed her eyes and smiled.* "I'm not going to lie, I was a little worried that maybe you'd take my surprise the wrong way."

Season: "Wrong way?"

PKMY: "Well, yeah.. Your old party members."

Season: *He shook his head, tightening his hug.* "It's an amazing thought, the idea of Cyril, Ivan and Mae, watching over this new city."

PKMY: *She grunted in appreciation.* "That's what I was hoping you'd think-"

Celest: "PKMY, Season!-" *She yelled out to them, causing them to separate.*

Season: *He quickly faced Celest, nodding his head in understanding.* "On my way-"

Celest: *She stood outside the cabin, watching Season and PKMY walk towards her.* "..."

Teresa: *She watched the party enter the cabin before looking back to Joy.* "So, in regards to what I just told you."

Joy: "Yes?"

Teresa: "Will there be any inconveniences?"

Joy: *She smiled in shock as if she was surprised by Teresa's offer.* "N-No-"

Chrisma: "Oh shit your face." *She giggled, tugging on her robes in excitement.*

Lupton: "Your plan strikes me as odd." *He grunted and squinted eyes in a curious manner.*

Teresa: "Please repeat what I have asked of you?"

Joy: "The specialised glyphs created from our home."

Chrisma: "The glyph used for Battling Oxident."

Teresa: "..." *She nodded her head at Joy and Chrisma, focusing her attention on Lupton.*

Lupton: ".. But?"

Teresa: "Hmm?"

Lupton: "You mentioned choreography, but what about the-?"

Teresa: "It is simple, I will merely show and tell them beforehand."

Joy: "Before we start off, why not discuss how you removed The Grand Seal?"

Lupton: "Removed?"

Chrisma: "But you've been with us the whole time Joy? You didn't have time to remove it."

Teresa: *She chuckled and nodded her head.* "For the favour, I am requesting, I see no problems telling you what happened."

----------

*Pepper and Locki floated high above the clouds with their radiant wings, watching the sunset together.*

Pepper: "I say, the conversation about making Valhalla accessible took me off guard."

Locki: "It was actually the mistress that brought it to The Wise's attention."

Pepper: "Oh?"

Locki: "She stated or at least showed us, that the times have changed, and our rules may not be of the same value as they once were."

Pepper: "Really?" *She smiled to herself.* "How do you think they'll do it?"

Locki: "Thy'm not too sure, to be honest."

Pepper: *Her soft jelly-like wings shined off Locki's armour.* "Losing my memories, forgetting about you, it must've been hard on you, yeah?"

Locki: "Pepper-" *He faced her and admired her face, causing him to place his hand on the side of her cheek.*

Pepper: "Locki?"

Locki: "Thy missed thou."

Pepper: *She shook her head with a smile.* "Please don't feel the need to be formal with me."

Locki: "But the mistress-"

Pepper: "Locki."

Locki: "Understood." *He smiled.*

Pepper: *She admired Locki's smile.* "I've missed you too."

Locki: "It was hard just watching you, worrying about you."

Pepper: *She looked down and smiled again, staring at the slight red glow in the clouds.* "You didn't have to-"

Locki: "Seeing you in a younger form, it was hard, but-" *He paused with a smile.*

Pepper: "But?" *She placed her hand on the opposite side of his face.*

Locki: "Don't ever leave me again."

Pepper: *She silently giggled.* "It's not like I did it purposely."

Locki: "But still." *He slightly frowned, waiting for Pepper's answer.*

Pepper: "Promise."

Locki: *He smiled and pulled her closer to him.* "Good-" *He spoke sternly and leant forward, gently kissing her on the lips.*

----------

*Lance and Alicia sat on a large orange rock on the outskirts of Gasher Hills.*

Lance: "I'm glad things finished when they did." *He stared at Surpreon in the distance.*

Alicia: *She smiled and looked up, staring at the twinkling stars.* "We haven't completed Surpreon just yet."

Lance: "No, I mean the Consultant."

Alicia: "Sorry?" *She looked at Lance and held his hand.*

Lance: "Things were getting pretty hard."

Alicia: "The Consultant was strong, I didn't have to fight him to know that."

Lance: "No."

Alicia: "Then, what do you mean?"

Lance: "Just.. The heavy feelin' of responsibility, it was just gettin' really hard."

Alicia: "Oh." *She nodded her head in understanding.*

Lance: "So, I'm kinda glad it finished when it did."

Alicia: "I thought you were holding yourself well."

Lance: "Yea, I did-" *He paused.* "I was-" *He sighed.* "I dunno, what're your thoughts?"

Alicia: "I like having responsibility."

Lance: "Good for you, I like watermelon."

Alicia: "Pfft, whatever."

Lance: "Oh wateva?" *He swayed his arm in front of Alicia.* "You're meant to be like, oh my jolly grottom bottom goodness."

Alicia: "Jolly grottom bottom goodness?" *She gave Lance a strange look.*

Lance: *He stared at Alicia pulling the strange face.* "Well maybe, feral grottom bottom sadness?"

Alicia: "Grumble bum." *She mumbled and looked down, trying not to smile.*

Lance: "..."

Alicia: "..."

Lance: "Pssht-" *He gasped with laughter, quickly covering his mouth.*

Alicia: "Tee heeehehe."
Lance: "Ahahaha." *He laughed and wrapped his arm around Alicia.*

Alicia: "We should start to walk back to Surpreon, Season looked like he wanted to discuss something with us."

Lance: "A little longer?"

Alicia: "Why? We should go before it gets dark."

Lance: "'Cause, I'm enjoyin' the moment with you." *He mumbled, placing his chin on her head.*

Alicia: *She smiled and closed her eyes.* "What about the-?"

Lance: "Shut up." *He smirked and wrapped his other arm around her.* "Don't worry 'bout gettin' there on time."

Alicia: "O-Okay."

----------

*PKMY and Holland sat on the edge of the water fountain, watching Rosterology devices light up Surpreon.*

PKMY: *She gently touched his piercing and bit her bottom lip with a smirk.* "I like it."

Holland: "Yeah, so does Freya." *He exhaled through his nose as he smiled with modesty.*

PKMY: "Congratulations." *She proudly rubbed his arm.*

Holland: "I guess it shows how strong we got because those creatures were easy to defeat."

PKMY: "Well you are strong."

Holland: "Not even Keno could defeat them."

PKMY: "Don't make me repeat myself, because you are strong." *She grunted, hitting his shoulder with a smirk.*

Holland: *He nodded his head and scratched his cheek.* "Yeah."

PKMY: *She watched several lamp-like lights flicker on, lighting up Surpreon furthermore.* "Not bad."

Holland: *He looked over his shoulder, watching the water flow.* "There's something I want to ask."

PKMY: "Yea, wat is it?"

Holland: "Umm.." *He had a flashback of walking through the forest with Blake, Cameron and Nathan.*

--

Blake: "So have you and Amy-" *He pointed with each hand, jabbing his fingers together in a childish manner.* "Are you together yet?"

Holland: "Umm, yeah, I think?"

Blake: (He thinks?)

Holland: (That reminds me.)

--

Holland: "There's something Blake said to me, that I want to clear up."

PKMY: "Yea?"

Holland: "Well.."

Freya: (Just say it.) *She growled in thought which echoed in Holland's mind.*

Holland: *He looked at PKMY.* "Are we a couple?"

PKMY: *She paused, looking at him in confusion.* "Aren't we?"

Holland: *He awkwardly half smirked with confidence.* "Well, I'm clearing it up. Amy Seraph, you are my girlfriend."

PKMY: "Holly-.."

Holland: "I may get repetitive and annoying at times, but I promise I'll protect you, care for you, and.. Never stop loving you."

PKMY: "Uh.." *She gasped with widening eyes, unsure what to say.*

Holland: "Is that acceptable?" *He smirked in a cheesy-like manner, scratching behind his head.*

PKMY: "Y-Yes!" *She enthusiastically nodded her head, staring at Holland with blushing cheeks.*

Holland: "Cool, now we're official! It's good to know what we are now, instead of just assuming."

PKMY: *Her entire face turned red.* "Yea."

Holland: "So-?"

PKMY: "Shut up-" *She quickly flipped onto Holland's lap and grabbed each side of his head, passionately kissing him.*

Holland: *He leant back and opened his eyes with a smirk.* "Maybe I should speak through the heart more often?"

PKMY: *She smiled, biting her bottom lip.* "Heh." *She slowly shuffled off Holland, taking a deep breath.* (My heart is pounding.)

Holland: *He inhaled deeply through his nose and smirked, sighing in accomplishment.* (Phew.)

Freya: (Was that so hard?)

Holland: (Shut up.) *He thought with a smirk, noticing PKMY's serious facial expression.* "What's wrong?"

PKMY: "Umm, I know you already call me Amy.. But, I don't mind if you keep calling me by that name now, if you like?"

Holland: *He smirked, slowly nodding his head in agreement.* "Alright."

PKMY: "That's if you want-" *She nervously shook her head.* "Actually, you can call me whatever you want."

Holland: "Alright, shit nugget."

PKMY: *She gasped and looked up at Holland, frowning with a twitching eye.* "Eh?"

Holland: "Ha ha, I'll settle with Amy."

PKMY: "Hmph." *She smirked in an annoyed manner.*

Holland: *He sniffed the air, causing his stomach to grumble.* "The feast is ready."

PKMY: *She sighed and rolled her eyes.* "You and your food."

Holland: *He jumped up and offered to help PKMY up.* "Food is my best friend-"

Freya: (Grr-) *Her growl echoed in Holland's mind.*

Holland: "Number two best friend."

PKMY: "Wateva." *She smirked and whacked Holland's hand away.* "I'm not a little girl-" *She stood up and faced the cabin.*

Tyler: *He opened the cabin's thick wooden door and stepped outside, noticing Holland and PKMY.* "The feast is ready." *He yelled out, waving his hand above his head.*

Holland: "Right on time."

PKMY: "Heh-"

Holland: "We're coming!" *He yelled out in a deep voice, causing Tyler to walk back inside.* "Amy?" *He looked at her with anticipation.*

PKMY: "Heh, go."

Holland: "Right." *He formed a fist in excitement and ran towards the cabin.*

PKMY: (What a loser.) *She smiled to herself, as she slowly walked towards the cabin.*

----------

Lance: *He shivered, causing him to hop off the rock.* "Alright, get on-" *He shuffled in front of Alicia and bent forward with his back facing her.*

Alicia: "O-Okay-" *She moved and scraped her legs along the rock, hopping on Lance's back.* "You really don't plan to carry me all the-"

Lance: "Pssht." *He smirked and flashstepped, causing a pulse of sand to blow away.*

----------

PKMY: *She reached for the thick wooden door and stopped.* "Hmm?" *She looked towards the entrance and noticed Lance carrying Alicia into the city.* "Hey!-" *She yelled out.*

Lance: *He flashstepped next to PKMY and sighed with a smile, carefully lowering Alicia onto the ground.* "We missed anythin'?"

PKMY: "The feast is being served."

Lance: "You were gonna eat without us..?"

PKMY: "Seems like it." *She opened the door and waved her hand for Lance and Alicia to enter.*

Lance: "Ahem, ladies?" *He stepped to the side, allowing Alicia to walk in front of him.*

Alicia: "Tee hee." *She smiled at Lance with warmth before skipping inside.*

Lance: *He looked at PKMY.* "And-"

PKMY: "Get inside."

Lance: "Y-Yes-" *He quickly power walked inside.*

PKMY: "Heh." *She smirked in a victorious manner, staring at Lance's back.*

Lance: *He sniffed several times, causing him to smile in reaction.* "The smell of food filled the air and the general atmosphere was pleasant."

*Lance observed the cabin and chuckled in approval as if it was the first time seeing it.*

Lance: "Wooden rails separated sections of the cabin-"

Alicia: (Grottom bottom explaining things again, tee hee.)

Lance: "The design had an arched shape and several tables circled around a stage-like platform. All signs of wood were polished and lights dangled from the roof."

PKMY: *She closed the door behind her and rolled her eyes at Lance, walking towards him.* "That does smell pretty good."

Lance: "Yea."

Alicia: *She spun around in amazement.* (Like Season and Lance, I haven't actually been in here since after they refurbished it.)

Lance: *He looked down, noticing a dark red carpet.* (The carpets look like a cinema's or a casino.)

*Lance looked up and noticed several thick, pub-like tables with long wooden seats attached to them.*

Lance: (And this area looks like a pub, kool-)

PKMY: "Walk faster." *She grunted, awkwardly shuffling behind Lance.*

Lance: "Then walk 'round me." *He grunted back at her.*

*Season, Pepper, Lezard and Holland sat at a table and noticed PKMY, Alicia and Lance, causing them to wave to catch their attention.*

PKMY: *Glass-like sounds echoed from a bar, triggering a flashback of the tavern.* (This reminds me of that tavern, right before Lezard took us to The Twilight Forest.)

Lance: *He looked around with a satisfied smile.* (I really like this cabin-pub thing.)

Alicia: *She skipped up several steps, walking towards the table the party sat at.* "It's larger than it looks from the outside."

Lezard: "Of course, silly sausage." *He giggled, sarcastically wiggling his bottom in the seat.* "It's just like Surpreon."

Season: *He stood up and swayed his arm across the table.* "Please."

Alicia: "Th-Thank you." *She smiled at Season and walked up to the table, noticing the cutlery already set.*

Season: "I'm really impressed with the place." *He slowly sat back down in his seat, watching Alicia sit down on the opposite side of the table.*

Alicia: "Yes, I wasn't expecting it to look like this."

Lance: "Oi, this cabin ain't bad aye." *He grunted and sat down next to Alicia, causing her to unintentionally smile to his presence.*

PKMY: "I'm not even sure this place should be called a cabin." *She grunted in amazement.*

Season: "So, what are your thoughts on this new extension of Surpreon?"

Lezard: "Lezard believes it's spectacular." *He giggled, inspecting the area around him.* "It reminds me of the entertainment area in Silver Wind Island."

Pepper: "I say, I really like this area, yeah?"

Alicia: "Y-Yep."

PKMY: *She nodded her head at the party for a greeting and sat next to Holland, looking up to the ceiling.* "I like the lighting."

Lezard: "It does seem rather mystifying."

PKMY: *She glanced at Lezard and slowly nodded her head.* "If it weren't for you, we might not have been able to defeat him."

Lezard: "The feelings are mutual!"

PKMY: "Heh."

Season: "So, there's something I would like to discuss." *He leant closer to the table and sat up straight, emphasising his seriousness.*

Lance: "Yea?"

*Tyler, Celest and Madora walked through restaurant-like swinging doors, holding trays of food.*

Holland: "A-Ah." *He stared at the food and raised his finger, politely telling Season to be quiet.* "The food has arrived."

PKMY: "Holly.." *She grunted in an annoyed manner.*

Season: "Hoh-hohoho." *He laughed at Holland and looked away, focusing to Tyler and the dish in his hand.* "Yes, we can talk in a moment."

Pepper: "I say, Tyler must've worked hard, it smells better than usual, yeah?"

Lance: "Yea." *He grinned at Pepper.*

Tyler: *He walked up to the party and slid the tray across the table, causing them to gasp in amazement.* "Here-"

Holland: "Wow!" *He stared at the tray full of food, causing his stomach to rumble loudly.*
Lance: "Nice!"

Tyler: "Help yourselves." *He smirked and turned around, slowly walking towards the swinging doors.*

Madora: "Oh dear-" *She carefully placed the tray on the table and quickly stepped to the side, stopping in front of Tyler.*

Tyler: "M-Madora?"

Madora: "You sit down, you've done enough, deary."

Tyler: "Ha ha, a-alright." *He chuckled and happily sat down next to Season, staring at an empty plate in front of him.*

Season: "This looks amazing." *He spoke on his breath, glancing at the wide array of foods on the trays.*

Lance: *He watched the trays expand, revealing more foods.* "Holy-"

Lezard: "Haunted fish-cakes!" *He interrupted Lance, squealing in a sarcastic manner.*

Pepper: "Haunted?"

PKMY: "Fish-cakes?" *She grunted at Lezard, raising an eyebrow in disgust.*

Holland: "Where's the fish-cakes?"

Lance: "Face palm." *He sighed, shaking his head with a smile.*

Lezard: "You say face palm? Bwarharh, love it!"

Lance: *He stared at the trays with a hungry smile.* "How does it expand like that?"

Tyler: *He looked at Lance, smiling in a modest manner.* "I crafted the actual dishes. Once they leave my hand, the Astragons slowly expand-"

Holland: "Chicken wings!" *He mumbled with a deep voice in excitement, reaching over the table.*

Tyler: "It may not be a good surprise, but, I prepared my best dishes."

Pepper: *She stared at the food, causing her stomach to rumble.* "The smells are divine."

Holland: "Hmm." *He held three chicken wings and chewed with delight.* "This is your best yet, Tyler."

Celest: "Another for our wingless heroes." *She carefully held the bottom of the tray and walked up to the table, smiling at the party.*

Alicia: *She watched Celest slide over the dish, noticing it filled with chocolate covered cupcakes.* "Yum!" *She leant over and grabbed several cupcakes, placing them on her plate.*

Tyler: *He picked up a chocolate cupcake, glancing across the table.* "Where's Locki and Teresa?"

Holland: *He looked over his shoulder, noticing Rachael, Luna, Blake, Nathan, Karol and Ginger sitting on another table.* (I wanted to say hello to them, but-)

Freya: (Stop thinking, continue eating!)

Holland: (Haha, I was too hungry.)

Pepper: "Locki had to go back to Valhalla, and Teresa-" *She noticed Teresa walk into the cabin with Lupton, Chrisma and Joy.* "There."

Tyler: *He looked past Pepper, keeping a fixated stare on Teresa.* "Thank you, Pepper-"

Pepper: *She nodded her head and licked her lips, before stuffing a large cream doughnut into her mouth.* (It even tastes divine.)

Tyler: *He chewed on the cupcake and watched the party eat the food with happy faces.* "I'm glad everyone likes it-"

Lance: "Shh, eat!"

Luna: *She wore a beautiful black dress with black earrings and lipstick.* "Damn! Oi, quick fingers?!" *She grunted with her mouth full.*

Tyler: "Q-Quick-?" *He looked over to the other table, noticing Luna glancing at him.* "What?" *He whispered under his breath.* "No! Not you, too!"

Luna: "Aha! Couldn't ya make a small mac burger? Or somethin' like that?"

Tyler: "I've got a few Fast Lawyers."

Luna: "Unareckseptable." *She frowned and chewed on a chicken wing.*

Lezard: *He giggled, staring at Lance.* "He grunted and forked down pork with roasted potatoes in one mouthful."

Lance: "Sshh."

Teresa: "On my mark." *She spoke in a stern voice, watching Joy, Chrisma and Lupton nod their heads in agreement.*

Chrisma: (How exciting!) *She groaned in thought, trying to keep her excitement contained.* (I would've never of thought Terra would do this.)

*Rachael unintentionally ran her fingers along a beautiful blue dress, glancing at Nathan, Luna and Karol who sat on the opposite table to the party.*

Rachael: "Don't worry about me-"

Luna: "But, Rach-"

Nathan: *He wore a tuxedo over his normal clothes with gelled hair.* (Rach..) *He put his hand on Luna's shoulder, causing her to sigh with sadness.*

Luna: "Nath.."

Karol: *He sobbed, intensely staring at Rachael.* "Waichael."

Rachael: *She chuckled, smiling at the guild.* "I'm fine, seriously-"

Luna: "Will you tell us later, or not?"

Rachael: "I will, promise-"

Madora: "Excuse me, Rachael." *She hobbled towards the table, carefully holding a tray in each hand.*

Rachael: "Madora-" *She leant to the side, allowing Madora to lean over her.*

Madora: "Thank you, deary." *She slid the trays along the table, watching the guild's morale boost.*

Rachael: (These couldn't have come at a more perfect time.)

Karol: *He gasped with a widening smile, which complimented his butler apparel.* "What kinds of foods are these?!"

Rachael: "Hehe, they're desserts from my world."

Madora: "Dig in! It's the least I could do for the strongest guild that walks these lands."

Karol: "W-Wright!" *He shouted in a victorious manner, eagerly reaching towards the trays.*

Ginger: "The strongest guild that has ever walked these lands. A rather anecdotal statement, but upon hearing it fills me with illogical joy." *She spoke with a smile.*

Blake: *He was dressed in a white suit, wearing purple lipstick and nails.* "Fufufu, it's got a good ring to it, hey."

Mio: (I am proud of you.)

Blake: (Fanks, babe.)

Mio: (I am not your babe. Bothersome human.)

Nathan: (They're right. I should cheer up.)

Destiny: (We both know how Luna felt. I'm getting the same vibe, even her scent is the same back then.)

Nathan: *He nodded his head at Destiny, cueing him to reach towards a piece of chocolate.* "I can even smell how nice this dessert is!"

Ginger: "I am detecting a significant source of sugar in these consumables."

Karol: "Drink?!" *He looked at Ginger, excitedly.*

Ginger: *Her eyes widened.* "Zaind's illogical beverage."

Blake: *He moaned in amazement as he ate a cupcake with two fingers.* "This is delicious."

Rachael: "This yummy food is why obesity is a health issue."

Blake: "Obesity? Wat's that?"

Ginger: "I only know the definition due to descriptive purposes. The state of being grossly fat or overweight."

Blake: "Eww, just use your Neurons to burn the extra calories away? Like, seriously?" *He hissed as if the answer was obvious.*

Luna: "We don't have Newgongs, remember?"

Blake: "Oh, from Earff?"

Luna: "Yea."

Tyler: *Teresa made eye contact, causing him to motion his hand over to the table.* "She better hurry up, at this rate everything will be gone."

Season: "Hohoho, I don't think you're wrong, Tyler." *He chuckled, biting into a caramel filled muffin.*

Teresa: *She looked behind her at the busy tables harbouring different parties.* (This vicinity has a very festive feeling to it.) *She looked at the party, walking towards the table.*

Alicia: *She looked up and noticed Teresa, causing her to shuffle down the seat.* "Lance-"

Lance: "Rawl grwoods." *He spoke with his mouth full and shuffled down, giving space on the seat for Teresa.*

Teresa: "I appreciate the gesture-" *She sat down and stared at the food with an emotionless face.*

PKMY: "Teresa, try these things." *She picked up a mint ball covered in green jelly.* "It's nice."

Teresa: "I still see no need-" *She grabbed the jelly off PKMY and looked at it with a strange face.* "To make consumables with such pointless flavour. If it has the nutrients the body needs-"

Holland: "But the brain-" *He licked his fingers.* "It's true the body needs nutrients, but the brain needs flavour."

Teresa: "Such an insignificant-" *She shoved the jelly into her mouth and her eyes instantly widened.* "This is-" *She quickly scanned the table and noticed PKMY reaching for the last one.* "Tedious."

PKMY: *She looked up in confusion.* "Wat is?"

Teresa: "Your assumptions on consuming my last consumable-" *She gracefully slapped PKMY's hand away and quickly snatched the last jelly.*

Tyler: *A smile consumed his entire face, as he proudly watched Teresa enjoy his cooking.* (Haha, such a great feeling.)

PKMY: "Alright, settle."

Lance: *He wiped his mouth.* "Yea, I didn't think I'd ever say anythin' like this to you, Teresa, but the food isn't gonna run anywhere-"

Teresa: "Excuse me?"

Lance: "N-Nothin'." *He quickly looked away in a defeated manner.*

Lezard: "This food, Tyler, it's like a party in my mouth." *His eyes rolled back and he moaned with excitement.*

Tyler: "Ha ha, thanks?" *He quickly glanced at the party with an awkward face, causing Lance and Alicia to snicker.*

Holland: "So, Season, before the food rudely interrupted you-"

Season: "Hohoho." *He chuckled at Holland's humour.*

Holland: "What did you want to talk about?"

PKMY: *She chewed on a bubblegum-like marshmallow, looking at Season with growing interest.*

Season: "Alright, I wish to discuss Battling Oxident."

Lezard: *He smiled as if he already knew.* (Is he going to officially announce its restoration?)

Teresa: "Hmm." *She nodded her head and swallowed.* "I have indeed noticed the glyph outside has been repaired and is also activate."

Season: *He nodded his head at Teresa, wiping caramel off his chin.* "First thing in the morning, Tyler and Dawn will be leading Silver Wind Island's researchers."

Lance: "Great?" *He rolled his eyes as if he didn't care.*

Alicia: "What have the researchers got to do with Battling Oxident?"

Season: *He ignored Lance and looked at Alicia.* "They will be organising a special fund-raising Battling Oxident."

PKMY: "When will it start?"

Season: "When the sun is at its peak."

Lance: "As in tomorrow?"

Tyler: "Yes."

Season: "But, unlike any other Battling Oxident, there have been numerous amount of requests."

Lezard: (Requests? This is new to Lezard.)

Pepper: "What are they, yeah?"

Season: "The requests are asking for those who defeated the Consultant to enter."

Lance: "I don't get it?"

Season: "They wish to see you all fight."

PKMY: "Really?"

Season: *He silently nodded his head, as he sipped from a cup.* "..."

Lance: (They want to see us?) "Kool." *He smiled in a flattered manner, reaching for a chocolate bar.*

Holland: "That's awesome."

Lezard: "Spectacular."

Season: "Since this will be a special Battling Oxident." *He smirked with excitement, readying to reveal his plan.*

PKMY: "Yea?"

Season: "I'll allow the ability to bend some rules."

Teresa: "Hoh?" *She looked intrigued, as she stuffed her mouth with marshmallows.*

Season: "You will be given the option to choose who you wish to fight, and, the option to change the battle scenery is given from the first battle."

Pepper: (Change of scenery from the first battle? Excellent.)

Season: "Also, all limitations will be removed, so you may exert as much Neurons or Astragons as need be."

Lance: "I'm in, where can I sign up?"

Season: "Lance.." *He spoke with seriousness, staring at him in a concerned manner.*

Lance: "Oh? You already signed up all our names again?"

Season: "Maybe.. You shouldn't fight?"

Lance: "Huh? I don't know wat ya mean?"

Season: "About your condition, I don't think you should fight."

Lance: "N-No, I'm fine."

Tyler: ".. Season knows best-"

Lance: "And it's my life. And I want to fight." *He sounded annoyed.*

PKMY: "Show some respect?"

Lance: *He leant forward on the edge of his seat, dropping the food on his plate.* "No-"

Season: *He looked down.* (He's right, perhaps I'm letting my concern take over my compassion-)

Pepper: "Season?"

PKMY: *She glanced at Lance, observing his facial expressions.* (He's really frustrated.)

Alicia: *She noticed Lance look slightly upset.* "Season, he hasn't lost any of his power-"

Season: "Yet-"

PKMY: "Season, she's right, don't be a loser."

Lance: *He looked at PKMY slightly startled.* "Y-Yea, wat she said."

Holland: "Season?" *He sounded as if Season was being too harsh.*

Season: *He sighed.* "Okay."

Lance: *He exhaled in relief.* "How 'bout no more surprises, aye." *He grunted and relaxed back into his seat.*

Teresa: (Surprises.) *She looked over her shoulder past Rachael's guild and stared at Joy, Chrisma and Lupton who sat on a table with Madora and Celest.*

Chrisma: *She looked at Teresa, noticing her nod her head.* "Terra's ready."

Lupton: "Was she serious?"

Chrisma: "Oh, I hope so, we got everything she asked for."

Joy: *She nodded her head.* "She did say she completed The Purafetic Ceremony."

Lupton: "Are you two up for it?"

Joy: "I memorised the words quite easily."

Lupton: "I already forgot."

Chrisma: "Oh shit your face." *She gasped at Lupton in shock.*

Joy: "Don't worry. Lupton's not a Score User. We, on the other hand, are required to have good memory."

Chrisma: "To know all the incantations?"

Joy: "Yes."

Lupton: *He nodded his head, smirking at Chrisma.* "Yea."

Chrisma: "Oh-"

Lupton: "Besides, I'm not doing it anyway." *He grunted and stood up.*

Lezard: *He smiled in happiness, watching Chrisma and Joy stand up.* (I wonder if they're talking about Lezard and how amazing he is?)

Madora: "Oh?" *She looked to her side, glancing at Lupton.* "What are you lot talking about?"

Celest: "Herm?" *She looked at Joy, Chrisma and Lupton, chewing with her mouth closed in an interested manner.*

Joy: "Please don't mind, it's meant to be a surprise."

Madora: "Oh deary me." *She giggled with excitement.*

Celest: "A surprise?" *She whispered in thought.*

PKMY: *She frowned at Season, wiping chocolate off her cheek.* "How do we enrol in the matches?"

Season: "You simply need the consent of the person you wish to fight and tell Madora."

Lance: "Huh? Why the old fart?"

Season: "Because she'll be the spectator."

PKMY: "Really?"

Tyler: "Why aren't you doing it, Season?"

Pepper: "That's new, yeah?"

Lezard: "Is there anything else?"

Season: *He intentionally ignored all their questions.* "That is all."

Lance: "This is kool." *He smirked and leant back, trying to contain his excitement.*

Holland: *He slid his empty dish away with satisfaction.* "What is?" *He mumbled and looked at Lance, placing his hands behind his head.*

Lance: "I get the feelin' this is all about us."

Alicia: *She nodded her head, cupping her pendant with a smile.* "I-I got that vibe too."

Lupton: *He shuffled away from the table and discreetly made his way towards a box-like Rosterology console, which was stationed on the wall.* (Alright, I can't believe we're going to do this.)

Lezard: *He looked over his shoulder, staring at his guild members.* "Well, I better tell my guild about what's happening with Battling Oxident."

Season: "Oh, that would be splendid, thank you."

Lezard: "No problemies." *He smiled at Season and stood up.*

PKMY: (Problemies?)

Lezard: "And-" *He looked at Tyler.* "Thank you for these sensational deliciously marvellous exceptional dishes, you fantastic majestic silly sausage." *He smiled and hobbled away from the table.*

Tyler: "You're welcome?"
Alicia: "Exceptional dishes?"
Holland: "Fantastic majestic-"

Lance: "Oh, not this again." *He waved his hand in frustration, causing the party to laugh.*

PKMY: "No, but seriously, problemies?"

Alicia: "Tee hee."
Lance: "Aha, nah, I reckon, aye!"

Lezard: *He jumped down the stairs and hobbled towards the table harbouring his guild.* "Ooo, I've got sensational news to tell you all."

Ginger: "Ey, Lezard?" *She shuffled down and created a vacant seat for Lezard.*

Blake: "About time someone wanted to join us, aye."

Lezard: "Naww, now I feel bad. Did you miss me?"

Blake: "Well-"

Luna: "It was definitely quieter without ya."

Blake: "Fufufu."

Rachael: "What's the news?"

Lezard: "Well, it's about Battling Oxident."

Karol: (A Battling Oxident? I want to enrol in one, at least once.) *He discreetly pouted, crossing his arms like a child.*

Rachael: "What is it?"

Luna: "Don't be gettin' us all excited and then pause for suspense."

Lezard: "Oh good gravy, how horrid of me, well-"

Teresa: *Purple lines drew themselves on her throat and formed a glyph, causing it to glow.* (I am ready.)

Lupton: *He stared at the Rosterology console in front of the wall.* (I don't know about Joy or Chrisma, but I'm ready.)

PKMY: "Hmm?" *She glanced at Teresa in a curious manner.* (Why are you suddenly feeling nervous and excited?)

Teresa: "Hmm?" *She glanced around not noticing PKMY's question.*

PKMY: (Teresa?)

Holland: "Well, I know who I want to fight."

Lance: "Me too-"

Season: "If it's possible, I'd like to keep it discreet."

Alicia: "H-How come?"

PKMY: *She frowned at Teresa before her attention slowly drifted back towards Season.* "Discreet? Discreet about wat?"

Season: "Battling Oxident-" *He glanced at PKMY before scanning across the table.* "With the person you'd like to fight, just ask them, and if they agree, let Madora know."

PKMY: "Heh, got it." *She smirked, punching a fist into her hand.*

Lance: "Can we ask more than one person?"

Season: "Of course, remember what I said? There's no rules or limitations."

Lance: "Awesome."

Tyler: "Why do you want it to be a secret?"

Season: "The superiors or higher bidders usually get the rosters before the fights even happen.." *He paused, looking down with a serious smile.*

Tyler: "Season?"

Season: "I have a feeling, this may be the last time we'll be together for a long time."

Alicia: "..."

Season: "So-" *He looked up, trying to keep a high morale.* "I wanted the people to be awed, even the spectators."

Lance: "Aye?"

Tyler: "I'm not following either?"

Season: "I don't want anything to be predetermined, even I'll be surprised-"

Lance: "Dude?" *He raised an eyebrow in confusion.*

Season: "Just for the memories?" *He looked at Lance as if that would satisfy his curiosity.*

Lance: *He shrugged his shoulders, nodding his head.* "Sounds kool to me."

Tyler: (If it's a surprise, then nobody would be able to bid on a match?) *He thought to himself in a curious manner as if he was trying to find Season's hidden motive.*

Pepper: "I say, I'd be happy to create more memories." *She smiled and pushed her empty dish away, looking at Season.*

Season: "Excellent."

PKMY: (So, he pretty much wants to make this Battling Oxident something to be remembered..)

Season: *He sighed in a satisfied manner and looked at Teresa, noticing the glowing glyph on her throat.* "What is-?"

Lupton: *He touched the device on the wall, causing the light around the tables to turn off.* (Now-)

Nathan: *He looked up in frustration.* "Who turned off the lights?"

Blake: *His eyes suddenly blinked into a dragon's, giving him night vision.* "My sexy eyes can still see pretty good, hey."

Cameron: *His image suddenly appeared next to Blake.* "..."

Blake: "There's my sexy man."

Alicia: *She stared at the glowing glyph on Teresa's throat.* "I-Is something wrong?"

Teresa: "..."

Season: "The glyph, has it got something to do with The Grand Seal?" *He sounded worried, readying himself to stand up.*

Teresa: *She ignored Season, gently touching the glyph on her throat.* ".. I wish to give you all a surprise."

Season: "Teresa?"

PKMY: "Is that why you're ignoring me?"

Lance: "Teresa? A surprise? No offence, but it'll probably be lame comin' from-"

Teresa: "..." *She ignored the party and stood up, stepping away from the table.*

PKMY: "Teresa-?"

Teresa: "Whoaooh-ooo-ooo-oooh." *Her voice echoed with an auto-tuned tone.*

Lance: "Wha-?!" *His jaw dropped in shock.*

Lezard: "Oh my word-" *He quickly looked over his shoulder, staring at Teresa in disbelief.*

Teresa: "Some people say I'm cold-hearted, some people say they're all that." *She strutted up to the stage-like platform, catching the entire party's attention.*

Pepper: "I say-" *She spoke with a dropping jaw in shock.*

Alicia: *She watched Teresa quickly spin around and face the audience, causing her hair to spiral around her head.* "T-Teresa?" *She whispered to herself in astonishment.*

Joy: *She stood on the stage behind Teresa, hidden in the dark.* "Now." *She whispered to Chrisma, who patiently stood next to her.*

Chrisma: "For research, whoup whoup." *She whispered, nodding her head at Joy in understanding.*

*Chrisma and Joy suddenly raised their arms in the dark, causing five glyphs to materialise in the air above Teresa.*

Joy: *She concentrated and stared at the glyphs, causing their lines to quickly connect.* (These are the musical glyphs back from our home.)

Karol: *He gasped, staring at the glyphs in amazement.* "H-Holy Neurons!"

Luna: "What is it?"

Karol: "Those glyphs are from my citee."

Nathan: "The Lost Ruins of Estel?"

Karol: "Y-Yheah."

Holland: *He watched a red, blue, green, yellow and white glyph glow in symphony, causing him to choke in sheer shock.* "Kgarh-?"

Teresa: "But you know what? I really really don't care!" *She stamped one foot forward and held it there with a smile.*

*A beat vibrated visible airwaves from the red glyph, causing Teresa to kick her leg.*

Season: *He stared at the glyphs with widening eyes.* (Parts of these glyphs are a hybrid combination of the glyphs used at Battling Oxident! I don't even recognise the rest!-)

*The green glyph started to visibly vibrate, causing a bass sound to echo.*

Teresa: *She swayed to each side with the beat.* "Back in the times, I was told." *She quickly tilted her head up and bent her knees to the beat of the music.* "Only failures make mistakes."

*The yellow glyph started to visibly vibrate, causing techno-like sounds to fill the air.*

Teresa: "Those who were told, that they were a mistake." *She spread her arms and flicked her head to each side.*

*Luna, Rachael, Tyler and Lance started bobbing their heads to the bass and techno music.*

Blake: "What filthy music is this-?"

Teresa: "You fail." *She pointed in front of her and slowly shook her bottom as she lowered herself to the floor.* "'Cause you fell into their ways, hey-aye."

*The white glyph visibly vibrated, causing techno-like sound effects to echo from it.*

Holland: *He started to clap his hands.* "Her voice sounds like she's using Rostical-"

Teresa: "Truth is." *She spoke deep in tone, causing the music to suddenly change. She slowly swayed her leg in a sweeping motion.* "No one's a mistake, no one's a failure!"

Joy: "Quickly!" *She whispered to Chrisma and held her robes, running onto the stage behind Teresa.*

*The blue glyph shined and slowly vibrated, causing a faint electric guitar to play in correspondence to the soft beat.*

Teresa: "You say I'm crazy." *She jumped up with enthusiasm, causing the music to become loud with a good beat.*

Joy and Chrisma: "Unacceptable." *Their high voices echoed nicely in the background.*

Teresa: "You say I'm sad." *She pretended to wipe a tear off her face.*

Joy and Chrisma: "Unacceptable."

Teresa: "I say, we are who we are." *She flicked her head, causing her hair to swirl above her head.*

Teresa, Joy and Chrisma: "'Cause I'm acceptable my way."

Teresa: "You say I'm great." *She rocked herself to the side with each beat.*

Joy and Chrisma: "Unacceptable."

Teresa: "You say I'm perfect." *She raised her hand in the air above her head.*

Joy and Chrisma: "Unacceptable."

Teresa: *She slowly lowered her hand down her body.* "I say, we are who we are-"

*Teresa, Joy and Chrisma jumped in the air at the same time and twirled around.*

Teresa: "'Cause I'm acceptable my way." *Her voice echoed throughout the cabin, as more party members started to move their body to the music.*

Lezard: "Simply beautiful, her voice is strong, kind, beautiful and-"

Blake: "Shhh, I'm listening aye."

Teresa: "You only like me, when I'm done your way." *She formed a cross with her arms in front of her chest and inhaled deeply.* "Just, there's no way I will change-"

Teresa, Joy and Chrisma: "Hey-aye."

Teresa: "You say I'm fake, 'cause I have my say." *She rocked her shoulders to each side and lowered her head, causing her hair to dangle in front of her face.*

*The red glyph started to vibrate more, causing the beat to become more distinctive.*

Teresa: "You say I'm great, when it's your way." *She quickly pointed to each side and raised her head with a smirk.*

Celest: *She slowly looked at Madora in shock.* "Is she intoxicated?"

Madora: *She unintentionally stared at Teresa with amazement.* "Wow, look at her go-"

Teresa: "But there's no way I will change-" *She formed a cross with her arms in front of her chest and inhaled deeply.*

Teresa, Joy and Chrisma: "Hey-aye."

Teresa: "I say, we are who we are." *She jumped to her side and looked in front with a serious smile, swaying her arm back and forth.*

*Joy and Chrisma waved their arms above the heads and swirled around, creating a good fluid-like motion.*

Teresa: "'Cause I'm acceptable my way." *She jumped up and raised her arms, causing the music to suddenly become more intense.*

Joy: *She cupped her hands.* "Whoaooh-ooo-ooo-oooh."

Teresa: "'Cause I'm acceptable my way." *She lowered her arms down her body and to her feet.*

*The blue, green and white glyphs vibrated, causing the guitar, bass and techno sound effects to become more dominating.*

Karol: *His eyes started to water.* (I can't express how much I appweciate this!)

*Teresa, Joy and Chrisma danced to the music, slowly stepping away from the front.*

Teresa: *She stood straight with an emotionless face as the music became more docile.* "He says I'm big at weight." *She started to strut towards the front of the stage with each word.* "But it's acceptable that way."

Joy and Chrisma: "Acceptable my way." *They raised their arms and pretended to slice the air in front.*

*Joy and Chrisma closed their eyes and clapped their hands.*

Teresa: "She says I'm bad at the face." *She placed her hands on her face.* "But I'm acceptable my way." *She spun around and opened her mouth with a smile.*

Joy and Chrisma: "Acceptable my way." *They slapped their face, mimicking Teresa's body posture.*

Alicia: *She stared at Teresa with her eyes and mouth wide open.* (Teresa-?!)

Teresa: "If you don't respect yourself." *She spun around and raised her hand, holding it in the air behind her.* "How will you respect your friends?" *She slapped her bottom, causing several of the fodder men to whistle.*

Lupton: *He choked on his saliva with a smile.* (Oh my-)

Lezard: "Oh my gravy." *He coughed and quickly placed a napkin on his nose.*

Karol: "Why is your nose bleeding?"

Lezard: "Hush now, little one."

Teresa: "Don't hide or seal your emotions." *She shook her head and finger with a disapproving face.*

Tyler: *He held a fork and knife in the air frozen in disbelief.* "I-Is this fake?" *The party ignored his question as they were frozen in shock themselves.*

Teresa: "'Cause only the unacceptable are made that way." *She leant forward and pointed at her forehead with both hands.*

*Joy and Chrisma quickly strutted behind Teresa.*

Teresa: "You say I'm crazy." *She jumped up with enthusiasm, causing the music to become loud with a good beat.*

Joy and Chrisma: "Unacceptable."

Teresa: "You say I'm sad." *She pretended to wipe a tear off her face.*

Joy and Chrisma: "Unacceptable."

Teresa: "I say, we are who we are." *She flicked her head, causing her hair to swirl above her head.*

Teresa, Joy and Chrisma: "'Cause I'm acceptable my way."

Teresa: "You say I'm great." *She jiggled her arms and winked with a smile.*

Joy and Chrisma: "Unacceptable."

Teresa: "You say I'm perfect." *She raised her hand in the air above her head.*

Joy and Chrisma: "Unacceptable."

Teresa: "I say, we are who we are, 'cause I'm acceptable my way." *Her voice echoed throughout the cabin.*

*Teresa, Joy and Chrisma jumped in the air at the same time and twirled around.*

Teresa: "You only like me, when I'm done your way."

Cameron: (This is not the same woman I fought-)

Teresa: "Just, there's no way I will change-" *She formed a cross with her arms in front of her chest and inhaled deeply.*

Teresa, Joy and Chrisma: "Hey-aye."

Teresa: "You say I'm fake, 'cause I have my say." *She waved her arms to each side and lowered her head, causing her hair to dangle in front of her face.*

*The red glyph started to vibrate more, causing the beat to become more distinctive.*

Teresa: "You say I'm great, when it's your way." *She quickly pointed to each side and raised her head with an evil-like grin.*

Alicia: (She sounds and looks so pretty-)

Teresa: "But there's no way I will change-" *She formed a cross with her arms in front of her chest and inhaled deeply.*

Teresa, Joy and Chrisma: "Hey-aye."

Teresa: "I say, we are who we are." *She jumped to her side and looked in front with a serious smile, swaying her arm back and forth.*

*Joy and Chrisma waved their arms above the heads and swirled around, creating a good fluid-like motion.*

Teresa: "'Cause I'm acceptable my way." *She jumped up and raised her arms, causing the music to suddenly become more intense.*

*Joy and Chrisma quickly tiptoed back leaving the front of the stage to Teresa.*

Season: (When did she have the time to rehearse this?!)

Teresa: "These are my choices, not yours, even if it's gold or bold." *She started to skip to the left while fist pumping above her head.* "Don't opinion-ate if you can't relate, only relate until you've felt the same heartache." *She twirled around and stopped.*

*Joy and Chrisma started to clap their hands to the beat.*

Teresa: "It was foolish to run away." *She cupped her hands and pounded her chest like a heartbeat.* "Just because I couldn't relate." *She skipped to the right of the stage.*

*Joy and Chrisma spiralled around, purposely twirling their hair and robes around.*

Teresa: "Don't run and forget your feelings, brace all emotions, brace your being." *She crossed her arms above her head, rocking her waist to each side.* "They say, we are who we are, 'cause we're acceptable our way."

Joy and Chrisma: "Our way."

Teresa: "Everything happens for a reason, so don't fight it, please don't fight it."

Joy and Chrisma: "Don't fight it."

*Teresa, Joy and Chrisma formed a line and they started to sway both arms and a knee in each direction.*

Teresa: "You say I'm crazy." *She jumped up with enthusiasm and clapped her hands above her head.*

Joy and Chrisma: "Unacceptable."

Teresa: "You say I'm sad." *She pretended to wipe a tear off her face with both hands.*

Joy and Chrisma: "Unacceptable."

Teresa: "I say, we are who we are." *She grabbed her hair and pretended to pull it out.*

Teresa, Joy and Chrisma: "'Cause I'm acceptable my way."

Teresa: "You say I'm great." *She jiggled her arms and winked with a smile.*

Joy and Chrisma: "Unacceptable."

Blake: "It's jiggling, eww."

Lance: *He smirked, pointing at Teresa in a childish manner.* "Docta Jingles."

Holland: "Haha."

PKMY: "Wat?!"

Teresa: "You say I'm perfect." *She raised her hand in the air above her head.*

Joy and Chrisma: "Unacceptable."

Teresa: "I say, we are who we are, 'cause I'm acceptable my way." *Her voice consistently echoed as they danced to the music.*

*The music started to die down as its volume slowly echoed out.*

Teresa: "There's no way I will change." *She slowly swayed her body, as she started to relax.*

Joy and Chrisma: "No way I will change." *They shook their heads in a calm-like manner, as they also started to relax with the music.*

Joy: "Whoaooh-ooo-ooo-oooh." *She sang on a high note, as her voice echoed numerous times.*

Teresa: "'Cause I'm acceptable my way." *Joy's voice continued to echo.*

Chrisma: "Whoaooh-ooo-ooo-oooh."

*Teresa closed her eyes with a smile, waiting for their echoes to fade away.*

Teresa, Joy and Chrisma: "'Cause I'm acceptable my way."

Teresa: "There's no way I will change." *She sung on a high soft note as the music almost faded away.*

Joy and Chrisma: "No way I will change." *They sang on one note until the music finally faded.*

Teresa, Joy, Chrisma and several people in the audience: "'Cause I'm acceptable my way."

Teresa: *She opened her eyes and gasped with laughter at what she just did.* "That is all." *She panted and looked to her side at Joy and Chrisma.*

Lupton: *He watched the five glyphs disintegrate into nothing, causing him to become alert.* (That's my cue-) *He played with the Rosterology console, causing the lights to flicker back on.*

*Every single person in the cabin stood up clapping, whistling and laughing in amazement, as they applaud and cheered Teresa, Joy and Chrisma for the performance.*

Tyler: *The fork and knife fell out of his hands and on to the plate.* "Wow-" *The entire party stood up and whistled for Teresa.*

Lance: "Holy. Mother. Effin'.. Shit.."

Holland: "Whoa.. That was amazing!"

Alicia: *She shook her head in amazement and giggled, enthusiastically clapping her hands.* "Go, Teresa!"

Season: "Hohoho." (I don't believe it, Terra.. Outstanding.)

PKMY: *She jumped up onto the seat, raising a fist into the air.* "Awesome! Yahooo."

Pepper: "I say, best performance yet!"

Tyler: "I never knew she could sing."

Pepper: "But, everyone can sing, yeah?"

Holland: "I think he means, she can sing really good."

Teresa: *She looked at Joy and Chrisma who were out of breath.* "D-Did that go well?" *She heard the laughter echo from every direction in the cabin.*

Chrisma: "Of course?"

Teresa: "But, the laughter."

Joy: "Laughter of cheers." *She smiled with a proud face.*

Teresa: *She smiled and laughed with embarrassment and satisfaction.* "Excellent."

Chrisma: *She noticed the standing ovations, causing her to cover her mouth, overwhelmed with excitement.* (Oh shit my bless!-)

*Several villagers, researchers, warriors, dancers and tribal members started to leave as if they only stayed to watch Teresa's performance.*

Karol: *He stretched after admiring Teresa's performance and yawned.* "I think I better get some sleep."

Nathan: *He nodded his head.* "I'll have an early night, too."

Luna: "Aye? Why so early, Natalie?"

Nathan: "For Battling Oxident."

Rachael: *She smirked, nodding her head in agreement.* "Sounds like a plan."

Luna: "Rach." *She grunted with a whisper.*

Rachael: "Am I in any condition to fight?"

Luna: *She looked surprised.* "Yea?"

Rachael: "I will see." *She spoke with a tired smile and slowly stood up, placing both hands on the table.*

Karol: "Nee hee, let's go, Nafan?"

Nathan: "We'll see you tomorrow."

Lezard: "Battling Oxident. How long has it been since we've had the last one?"

Ginger: "Irrelevant."

Cameron: *He smiled at Blake.* "I was hoping we could enjoy the night sky?"

Blake: "Hey?" *He hissed with a growing smirk.*

Cameron: "Has your enjoyment of describing the astronomical phenomenon been depleted?"

Blake: "Fufufu, nah. Let's go."

Rachael: "All of you, have a great night."

Cameron: "I concur."
Blake: "Thanks, my sexy bitch."
Ginger: "Indeed."
Luna: "Cheers."
Destiny: "Yeup."
Nathan: "Will do. Thank you."
Karol: "Yooh tooh!"
Lezard: "Toodles!" *The entire guild besides Luna and Ginger stood up, all walking in different directions.*

Rachael: *She watched Nathan and Karol speak to Madora, before giving herself time to see her herself.* "Madora?"

Madora: "Oh, Rachael Taylor?"

Rachael: "They say you're the master of Astragons. Could I please speak to you for a moment?"

Madora: "Of course."

Chapter 6: Battling Oxident

Lezard: "Sunlight shined brightly upon the arena of Battling Oxident." *He mumbled to himself and hobbled up the stairs with the guild closely following, watching the charms sway from his hat.*

*Sounds of constant chatter filled the air as thousands of people gathered, easily giving off a lively atmosphere.*

Lezard: "People grunted and moaned, as they shuffled into the spectator seats."

Male Warrior: *He shuffled down a row and sat down with his warrior-like party members, holding a bowl of food in excitement.* "I heard this will be one of the best Battling Oxidents-"

Female Warrior: *She sat down next to him, causing her armour to rattle.* "Stop talking, I'm already getting butterflies!" *She leant over and reached into the bowl, eating some of his food.*

Madora: *She stood next to Season's chair and scanned across the spectator seats, watching the rows quickly fill up.* (I just checked the roster, and I personally believe, this is going to be the biggest one yet-)

Rachael: *She led the guild up the stairs, walking towards one of the few vacant rows remaining.* "We've got a long line-up of matches."

Lezard: "The party closely followed our Razzypoo in a line-like formation."

Ginger: "Ey, Lezard?"

Lezard: "Yes, my favourite spice?"

Ginger: "Be quiet."

Blake: "Fufufu."

Lezard: "Ouchies." *He sarcastically wiggled his bottom, causing Luna to roll her eyes.*

Luna: "I don't wanna see that-" *She awkwardly pointed at Lezard's bottom in disgust.* "-All in my face."

Destiny: (Yeup.) *Her meow of agreement echoed in Luna's thoughts.*

Lezard: "Okay, okay, I'll be serious now, no more picking on Lezard."

Karol: *He observed the many spectator rows, causing him to pout in confusion.* "This arena looks like it's in good conwitchion."

Luna: "Condition."

Karol: "Condishion."

Luna: *She nodded her head.* (It is in good condition-) "I don't recall anyone repairin' Battling Oxident, why's that?"

Ginger: "It is separate from Surpreon."

Blake: "'Cause of the Spacial Funnel, hey?"

Cameron: "Indeed."

Karol: (I was gunna ask why it didn't look damaged.) *He thought to himself in a satisfied manner.*

Blake: (Despite Battling Oxident being worldly known, I've never had the chance to participate due to being part of the warriors.)

Nathan: "Our matches are not said to start until theirs has finished."

Luna: "Ah huh."

Blake: (So we fight each other after Amy's party-)

Rachael: "Did any of you catch what the rosters were?" *She shuffled down the row and sat down.*

Lezard: "No, dear child, I only know the number of matches."

Rachael: "Damn, same." *She looked to her side and glanced at each guild member, watching them shuffle down the row.* "Anyone else?"

Ginger: "Negative."

Blake: "Na."

Karol: "Nope."

Cameron: "Nor do I know such relevant information."

Nathan: "Looks like we'll be fighting blind, Rach."

Lezard: "Lezard thinks that's what Season wanted."

Ginger: "It could be argued that either knowing or not knowing the matches beforehand would generate the most excitement."

Blake: "I fink knowing the matches would create the most excitement."

Luna: "Nah, not knowin' is more excitin', aye."

Destiny: (Yeup!) *She meowed in agreement.*

Rachael: *She looked down to the arena, staring at the vacant sandpit.* "Before we get involved in the games, I just wanted to say awesome work to Karol and the twins for pulling off that amazing score, dance."

Lezard: *He sat down next to Rachael and enthusiastically nodded his head.* "It was fabulous, it was equally as good as Teresa's song and dance."

Nathan: (I was actually really surprised by it.)

Luna: "The song My Friends, wonder who they were about, aye."

Karol: "Nee hee."

Rachael: *She discreetly noticed Nathan smiling at Karol, causing her to smirk.* (Karol in a way has depended on Nathan throughout our entire guild's lifetime.. But, in the end, it turns out Nathan also depended on Karol-)

Karol: "Ah, shucks." *His face went red, as he plunked himself on the seat.*

Nathan: "You should be proud, it was a good performance."

Karol: *He gasped, staring at Nathan with widening eyes.* "Y-Yooh really think?"

Nathan: "Yeah." *He smiled and glanced to the side, watching Blake and Cameron sit down.*

Cameron: "This is interesting." *He spoke in a professional manner, observing the arena in amazement.*

Nathan: "Interesting?" *He mumbled to himself and glanced around as if he was expecting something.*

Ginger: *She observed Cameron, adjusting the bandages on her arms.* "Ey, Cameron, what is with that illogical facial expression, please respond?"

Blake: "Prob like me.. He never had the opportunity to admire things like this, hey." *He smirked and looked to his side, staring at Cameron for confirmation.*

Cameron: *He looked down, staring at the armour on his legs in a serious manner.* "Precisely right."

Karol: "That's no good."

Lezard: *He played with the cone-shaped hat, looking at the arena in a bored manner.* "So, how long until-?"

Madora: "May I have everyone's attention, please?!" *Her voice echoed throughout the stadium, causing the loud chatter to stop.*

Lezard: "Delicious timing-"

Blake: *He leant towards Cameron and pointed at the arena gates.* "And that's where they walk into-"

Luna: "Shh, it's startin'-"

Blake: "Watevs."

Rachael: "Both of you." *She grunted with a mature frown, causing them to stop their bickering.*

Madora: "Battling Oxident has been a ritual between villages, cities and communities. It's one of the only two sports, tests or trials known across the lands-"

*The growing crowd cheered loudly, causing Madora to look annoyed before suddenly smirking at their excitement.*

Madora: "So having said that, let's start off with the first match!"

*The crowd cheered louder as they focused their attention to the two gates.*

Rachael: (Here we go.) *She smiled with excitement, noticing the crowd's cheers fade away.*

Destiny: *She watched someone walk out from one of the gates through Luna's eyes.* (Everyone's excitement just changed to anticipation.)

Luna: (Yea, I'm gettin' that same feelin' as if we're at The Agoura Marbles.)

Destiny: (Yeup!)

Pepper: *She slowly walked into the arena, dragging the mallet in the dirt beside her.* (She asked me some time after Teresa's beautiful performance-)

PKMY: *She power walked into the arena from the other side, instantly catching Pepper's attention.* (Back then on the ship..)

*PKMY frowned in recollection, triggering a flashback.*

--

Pepper: *She jumped forward and flew into the air, looking down at the party.* "SHINING RAIN" *She formed a fist and punched downwards, blasting razor blade-like spears of light towards PKMY and Teresa.*

Teresa: *She watched several spears of light hit the deck, instantly bursting planks of wood into the air.* "Humph-" *She stepped forward with a disappearing image.*

PKMY: *She watched the spears of light plummet towards her.* "Shit-" *She bent forward and flashstepped before the light fell into striking distance.*

Pepper: *She smiled, noticing the destructiveness of her Rostical.* "All that was from one attack."

--

PKMY: (She was just throwing me and Teresa around..)

Pepper: (She sounded very eager to fight me.)

PKMY: (Today will be different.)

Pepper: (Now that I remember who I am, I'm able to draw out that fire any time I want-)

PKMY: *She stopped in the middle of the arena and smirked, leaning to one side.* "Ready when you are."

Pepper: *She stopped in front of PKMY and played with the handle of the mallet.* "Thy am ready, yeah?"

PKMY: "Now that you're an adult, I'll have no worries smashing you up."

Pepper: *She chuckled in a competitive manner.* "Thy see."

Madora: "Pepper, please choose your environment to battle on!"

Pepper: *She silently stared at PKMY and smirked, watching the area blur and swirl.* "Welcome to-"

Blake: *He stared at the arena, keeping his focus on PKMY.* (The arena in transforming-)

*The crowd suddenly awed in amazement, watching Pepper and PKMY stand in a hall completely made of glass-like ice.*

Pepper: "The Imperial Glacial Castle."

PKMY: *Her eyes widened as she looked around in shock.* (She has the upper-hand-)

Madora: "First match, PKMY versus. Pepper!"

PKMY: *She sniffed in a serious manner, focusing her attention back on to Pepper.* (I'll never let an opponent get to me-)

Pepper: *She tapped her fingers on the mallet's handle, stepping forward deep in thought.* (As a Sacred Knight, I'll ensure her defeat will not clash with my pride.)

PKMY: (Not after what I've been through-)

Madora: "Commence!"

PKMY: *She grunted with widening eyes and suddenly sprinted towards Pepper, raising her fist with determination.* "Harh!"

Pepper: "I say-" *She quickly tensed her arm up and spun around throwing the mallet in an uppercut-like motion at incredible speeds.*

PKMY: *She quickly jumped to the side, watching the mallet sway past her head.* "Heh-"

Pepper: "Hurling Might." *She held the mallet with both hands, swinging it like a bat towards PKMY's face.*

PKMY: *She gasped with widening eyes.* (A critical hit!-) *She quickly cartwheeled to the side, barely avoiding Pepper's strike.*

Pepper: *She listening to the glass-like floor vibrate, due to her attack.* (She's got fast agility-)

PKMY: *She jumped forward and pointed two fingers at Pepper, stepping into striking distance.* "Two finger snap-quick double strike."

Pepper: *She quickly swayed to each side, avoiding PKMY's fingers jabs.* "Hmm-" *She watched her hair flap over her shoulder from the force of PKMY's attack.*

PKMY: "Double Smack." *She quickly spun around and jumped up, chopping across Pepper's face.*

Pepper: *She let go of the mallet and quickly blocked PKMY's chop with her forearm.* "Hermph-" *She leant forward and pushed PKMY back, catching the mallet before it touched the floor.*

PKMY: *She slid back and glanced at her hand, noticing it was red from where she hit Pepper.* "Tssk-"

Pepper: "Hammer Spin." *She swung the mallet and a howling wind pushed PKMY further back.*

PKMY: *She gritted her teeth and raised an arm, covering her eyes from the wind.* (She intends to use the Azure Burst's technique as tailwind and buffer-)

Pepper: *She jumped forward, giving the illusion she glided above the floor.* (Jumping in the wind's current allows me to move faster without exhausting as much Neurons as I usually would-)

PKMY: "Crippling might, twenty two finger, wind gales strike." *Her image suddenly disappeared, causing several people from the crowd to gasp.*

Pepper: (She flashstepped?)

PKMY: (Looks like she's stronger than me with that mallet of hers-)

Pepper: *Her eyes shined gold, causing PKMY's image to blur into her vision.* (No! I see her-)

PKMY: *She walked to the side, watching Pepper glide towards her in slow motion.* (She's adjusting herself towards me? I'm in a constant flashstepping state, how can she see me?)

Pepper: *She leapt into striking distance and leant back, elegantly raising her leg.* "Infinity Fury of Kicks."

PKMY: *She stared at Pepper's leg, watching her move in slow motion.* (Wateva, I'll stick to the plan-)

Pepper: (After all you've gone through, you still underestimate these eyes of mine?) *She focused on her leg, causing the muscles to visibly spasm in preparation.*

PKMY: *She frowned at Pepper's slow-moving image and swayed forward, jabbing her hand at blinding speeds.* (Hah!-)

Pepper: "Hmph-" *She quickly kicked across PKMY's face at blinding speeds, causing a sudden thump-like sound to echo.*

*PKMY and Pepper's image suddenly appeared to the audience in a different stance.*

Karol: "W-Woah-"

Luna: "Nath, she moves like you."

Nathan: "Yeah, Pepper is also able to move her legs at the same speed."

Pepper: *She spun around, kicking PKMY across the face.* "Hmph-"

PKMY: *She spiralled out of the flashstep, violently hitting the floor.* "Dammit-"

Pepper: *She leant forward and white radiant wings erupted out of her back.* "Hermph-"

PKMY: *She quickly leant up, noticing a white glow in the ice structure surrounding Pepper.* (She kicked me out of my flashstep with a slightly faster attack..? That's something someone very experienced could do-)

Pepper: "I say, to fight a Sacred Knight, you are truly blessed."

PKMY: *She glared at Pepper, discreetly observing the wings behind her back.* "Shut up-"

Pepper: "Okay-" *She flew towards PKMY at incredible speeds, suddenly grabbing her around the neck.*

PKMY: "Karh-" *She looked shocked, watching Pepper tilt her head back.*

Blake: (C'mon, Amy.. You didn't even have time to react!)

Pepper: "Hermph-" *She looked up and her wings moved like razor blades, catching PKMY's attention.*

PKMY: (Her wings-?!)

Pepper: (When fighting wingless opponents-) *She jumped up, blasting high into the air.* (To save energy, I will use the gravitational pull to assist in the win..)

Karol: (They're flying towards the ceiling? Is she going to smash PKMY into it?)

PKMY: "Grr-" *She angrily grabbed Pepper's wrist with both hands.*

Pepper: *Her wrist started to crack around PKMY's grip.* "Grah-" *She threw PKMY forward and smashed her into the roof, causing sparkles of ice to splinter around her.*

PKMY: *She grunted and opened her eyes, watching the ice sparkle past her face.* "Tssk-"

Pepper:*She hovered in the air and looked up to the roof, staring at PKMY.* (An attack with the force of cracking this castle's interior.. PKMY, that would've hurt you far more than you're letting on.)

PKMY: *She violently punched into the ice next to her and grabbed hold of the roof, keeping herself from falling down.* (Shit, that hurt-)

Pepper: "This fight has gone for too long."

PKMY: "Eh? Too long? It's only just started."

Pepper: "Hmph."

PKMY: Wateva! AIR SWIRL" *She violently pushed her free arm forward, causing a gust of wind to force Pepper back on to the floor.*

Ginger: (That Air Swirl Remenistal is clearly mastered.)

Pepper: *She casually stood on the floor and ignored the wind, watching the shards of ice blow around her.* "Hmph." *She smirked to herself, looking back up to PKMY.*

PKMY: *She noticed Pepper's smirk, causing her to frown.* (I hate when people smirk like that in battle!)

Pepper: (Is she trying to force me to my knees? I endure the resistance of wind all the time-) *She stepped back and stood on her toes, readying to dive up towards PKMY.* (This force is nothing to me-)

PKMY: (Fine, take this then!) *She suddenly jumped off the roof and pulled her hand to the side, causing the air to ripple like water.* "Seven finger snap-flying palm strike."

Pepper: (I will finish her with my-) *She paused in thought and looked across the other side of the room, noticing the mallet lying on the floor.*

PKMY: (Yeah focus your attention somewhere else!-) *She smirked, diving directly above Pepper.*

Cameron: *He intensely stared at Pepper, slightly shaking his head in disappointment.* (You should never look away from your opponent.)

Pepper: (She isn't the only one that may understand people's thoughts-) *She casually looked back up to PKMY, placing her hand to the side.*

PKMY: *She lunged into striking distance, shouting with anticipation.* "It's too late!-"

Pepper: "Seven finger snap-flying palm strike."

PKMY and Pepper: "Harh!" *They pushed their palms forward, causing a loud screech to echo in between their hands.*

Pepper: *Her hair violently blew back as she tried to push PKMY away.* "I say, you're strong."

PKMY: "Same-" *She frowned with a smirk and tried to push forward, watching her arm wobble.*

Rachael: (They're evenly matched?)

PKMY: *Her hair violently swayed to each side, as distinctive sounds of clothes ripping could be heard.* (Tssk, the Rasticsplash!-)

*A sudden burst of wind forced Pepper and PKMY back, causing the audience to gasp.*

Pepper: (Her Azure Burst matched my power!-)

*Pepper and PKMY intensely stared at each other, sliding away in opposite directions.*

PKMY: "Let's try that again! Seven finger snap-flying palm strike."

Pepper: "Nine finger snap-majestic pulse." *An arc of light swirled around her legs and hands, causing her to instantly stop sliding.*

PKMY: *She placed both hands to her side and the air started to ripple.* (Don't recall using the long-range version in a while.)

Pepper: "Hermph-" *She pointed at PKMY and the arcs of light around her vanished.*

Lezard: (The light vanished?!)

PKMY: "Harh!-" *She mentally aimed at Pepper and nudged her hands forward, releasing a white aura which pierced through the air.*

Pepper: *She stepped to the side and flicked her finger, causing a small arc of light to slam into the white aura.* "..."

PKMY: "Eh?" *She watched the different textures of white aura push themselves back and forth in the air.*

Lezard: "What a sight, you sometimes see Remenistal connect in such a manner, but not often with Azure Bursts."

Ginger: "Ey, I concur."

Lezard: "Don't you regret not learning the finger snap Azures, Rach?"

Rachael: "Nah, I'd rather punch you in the face instead of poking you to death."

Lezard: "Bwarharh."

Rachael: "To be serious, I'm a master at Hapkido, might as well use the best tools in my arsenal, right?"

Luna: "Who're you tryin' to convince? We already know you're badarse."

PKMY: (I put a lot of Neurons in that damned Azure!)

Pepper: *She glanced past the aura, staring at PKMY with an emotionless face.* (I see an opening!-) *She flashstepped, causing the ice to crack under her feet.*

PKMY: *She continued to wait and see which aura was stronger.* (Come on-)

Pepper: *She flashstepped next to PKMY and smirked, holding the mallet next to her.* "Seventy-seven divinity strike."

PKMY: "Tssk-" *She quickly faced Pepper, hiding her shock.* "Three finger snap-flashing fist strike." *She pointed her fingers and stepped back in a defensive manner.*

Nathan: (Her reaction time is about the same as mine-)

Pepper: "Hermph." *She grabbed the mallet with both hands, slamming it forward at PKMY's face.*

PKMY: "Grah-" *She flicked her finger and sparks scattered off Pepper's mallet.*

Pepper: *She looked surprised, staring at PKMY with her blue eyes.* (She deflected my swing with her fingers-?!) *She spun around and slammed the mallet towards the side of PKMY's head.*

PKMY: *She stepped back and flicked her finger, diverting Pepper's swing.* "Tssk."

Rachael: (How is she missing with a mallet at such a close range?)

Pepper: (I see-) *She spiralled around in slow motion.* (She's using the Azure Burst purely for defensive purposes-)

PKMY: *She glanced from side to side, carefully inspecting Pepper's movements.* (I won't be able to keep this up, she's moving too fast.)

Karol: (She's attacking in a continuous spiral-like manner!)

Pepper: *She moved at quick and sharp speeds, continuing to slam the mallet towards PKMY.* (I have yet to get a solid hit in-)

PKMY: *She flicked both hands in front and deflected Pepper's strikes, ignoring the waves of sparks.* (Time to use Rostical I guess-)

Pepper: *Her body glowed a shade of blue.* "Herh-" *She grunted and her eyes shined gold as she flicked the mallet upwards.*

PKMY: *She gasped and crossed her arms, as the force pushed her slightly back.* (Such a sudden gap in strength!-)

Pepper: "Hurling Might." *She spun around and slammed the mallet into PKMY's gut.* "Harh."

PKMY: (Gerh-) *She wheezed as if she was going to throw up.*

Nathan: (A direct hit!)

Pepper: "Hermph!" *She continued to spin around with PKMY on the end of the mallet.*

PKMY: *She awkwardly leant on one side, due to the spinning motion.* "FLAMING-"

Pepper: *She quickly stopped and watched PKMY fly back into the air.* "Thy say, not finished!-" *She jumped up and flew towards PKMY, raising the mallet behind her.*

Karol: (Whow, she can fly so elegantlee!)

Ginger: *She watched the mallet glow red.* (Having wings is a huge advantage, it is illogical to point out something so obvious, but still-)

Pepper: "Shattering Stones."

PKMY: *She coughed out blood, watching Pepper fly towards her in slow motion.* "Harh!?"

Pepper: "Herh." *She slammed the mallet against PKMY's chest and blasted her back, smashing her into the wall.*

Luna: (Whoa-)

PKMY: (Shit..-) *She fell forward and collapsed onto the floor, as shards of ice rained on her back.*

Pepper: *She slowly floated down to the ground, elegantly placing her feet on the floor.* "..."

Madora: "It appears PKMY is unable to battle, Pepper is the winner!" *Her voice echoed throughout the stadium as she watched the area revert back to normal.*

PKMY: *A cool revitalising wind completely healed her wounds.* "Ah-" *She gasped and puffed out dirt, holding her head in disorientation.*

Pepper: *She placed the mallet over her back, causing it to become invisible.* "That was fun." *She walked up to PKMY and reached down to help her out.*

PKMY: "Heh-" *She raised her arm and allowed Pepper to pull her up.* "Sure was."

Pepper: "We better-"

PKMY: "Get off the arena?" *She smirked, causing Pepper to smile in agreement.* "You know, you're pretty good."

Pepper: "Hmph, you mean, not being a child and having no memories?"

PKMY: "Heh." *She smirked, brushing dirt off her legs.*

Lezard: "That was a fast battle."

Cameron: "I believe all these matches will go relatively quick."

Nathan: "What makes you say that?"

Luna: "Spill the beans."

Cameron: "There are no beans to spill?"

Ginger: "That is a logical answer."

Lezard: "Ooo, where's the beans-?"

Rachael: "Because?" *She spoke in an annoyed manner.*

Cameron: "When powerful opponents fight, battles do not seem to last for too long."

Lezard: "Yes, but why?"

Cameron: "By reflecting on my vast amount of empirical experience, I have concluded that every action is not wasted, time is crucially acknowledged and devious stratagems are kept to a minimum-" *He shook his head, staring at the arena.* "Furthermore.."

Ginger: "Furthermore? You should not need prompting to continue your dialogue."

Cameron: *He focused his attention on PKMY and Pepper, watching them walk closely alongside each other out of the arena.* "There is a certain essence of respect when fighting someone stronger than you."

Luna: "So, wat are ya sayin'?"

Karol: "Th-That stwong peeple won't be afraid to give up, or waste time on twying to deceive the enemy."

Cameron: "Precisely."

Lezard: "Ooo!" *He shivered, sarcastically giggling to himself.* "That was splendid, Karol."

Karol: "Nee hee."

Ginger: "Ey, Cameron, I have to disagree with you."

Cameron: "Oh? Explain your reasoning behind this statement."

Ginger: "It is not when powerful people engage in combat, it is when fighting someone of your own calibre."

Rachael: "I can agree to that."

Cameron: "I see."

Ginger: "But you are right about something-" *She looked back to the empty arena.* "Everyone here is powerful."

Rachael: (She must be relating the conversation about Niklauseh.)

Madora: "Next match is-"

Holland: *He staggered into the arena.* (I wanted to fight her because Amy always looks up to her.)

Teresa: *She gracefully stormed into the arena, suddenly appearing in the middle.* (Despite being my younger sister's partner-) *Swirls of dirt blew around her feet.* (I will end this very quickly.)

Luna: "Flashsteppin' into the arena? Wat a try hard."

Karol: (It's that sckary woman!)

Madora: "Choose your arena!" *She shouted in excitement, listening to her voice echo around the spectator seats.*

Holland: "Got it." *He closed his eyes and the area burred and swirled, suddenly changing into a forest.*

Teresa: *She stood on the spot unaffected by the change of scenery.* (Location does not matter-)

Holland: *He opened his eyes and looked around with a smile.* (Looks exactly like The Twilight Forest.)

Madora: "Holland versus. Teresa!-"

Chapter 7: Holland Versus. Teresa

Madora: "Begin!"

Holland: "Alright-" *He held three Summonce Scarbras and readied to throw them in the air.* (I'll go all out! I've heard crazy things about her fighting skills from Amy-)

Teresa: *She continued to stand on the spot, looking at Holland with an emotionless face.* "..."

Karol: "Sh-She's just standing there?"

Holland: *He threw the three orbs into the air, keeping a close eye on Teresa.* (I've got numbers on my side-)

Rachael: *She slightly leant forward, watching with interest.* (I always found Blake and Luna's abilities very fascinating.)

*Destiny, Fryfry and Twotters flew, swarmed and pounced out of their individual glyphs.*

Holland: "Go!" *His words caused Destiny, Twotters and Fryfry to charge towards Teresa.*

Teresa: "..." *She leant back and started to run forward, staring at Holland with an emotionless face.*

Destiny: "Meehee-" *She watched Teresa's image suddenly appear above her in shock.*

Teresa: "..."

Destiny: (What?! How?!) *She looked up, flapping her wings in slow motion.*

Teresa: "..." *She gently placed her hand on the back of Destiny's head.*

Destiny: "Meehee-?!"

Teresa: "..." *She pushed down and violently slammed Destiny into a thick tree.*

Fryfry: "Bzzz-" *They swarmed around Teresa.* (Notorious Twi-)

Teresa: *Her image disappeared and she reappeared directly in front of Holland, causing the surrounding ferns to blow back.* "..."

Holland: *He coughed with fright and stepped back in slow motion.* (Crud!-)

Teresa: "I understand you are a powerful Scoldrant User-" *She placed her finger on Holland's chest.*

Holland: *He looked down in shock, shaking his head with a frown.* "I've got Fryfry and Twotters still-" *He grunted and raised his fists.*

Teresa: "Negative."

*The swarm of fireflies suddenly dropped to the ground one by one and Twotters suddenly blasted to one side.*

Blake: "Wat?!"
Luna: "Holy shit?!"

Nathan: "Language-"

Twotters: (I felt a hit-) *She slid across the grass in a limp-like manner, hissing in pain.*

Teresa: "Typhoon's Pulse." *She nudged her finger forward and a loud pop of wind caused Holland to silently drop to his knees.*

Holland: "Gah-" *He collapsed to the ground and Destiny, Fryfry and Twotters disintegrated into nothing.*

Madora: "I-It appears Holland is unable to battle!-" *She spoke in shock as if she wasn't expecting the match to end so quickly.* "Teresa is the winner!"

*Madora shouted with an echoing voice, watching the arena revert back to normal.*

Holland: *A cool breeze completely revitalised him.* "Ah-"

Teresa: "Hmph." *She stared at the gate and started to walk towards it.*

Rachael: (That's cold, I thought they were friends-?)

Teresa: *She stopped and frowned in an annoyed manner.* "Tcch-" *She turned around and faced Holland, slowly walking up to him.*

Holland: (Wow, I had no chance-) *He stared at the dirt, shaking his head at himself.*

Teresa: "Your drive to fight was exceptional." *She stood next to Holland and presented her hand, offering to help him up.*

Holland: "Thanks." *He spoke in appreciation and grabbed Teresa's hand, pulling himself up.*

Nathan: (Wow, Teresa completely defeated him. I knew she was strong, but far out-)

Madora: *She watched Holland and Teresa leave the arena.* "Next is-"

Lance: *He walked into the arena, causing the crowd to cheer.* (Aha, weird!)

Ginger: *She looked at Lance, causing her to glance at Luna.* "That man who saved my city, is he really your brother? Please respond."

Luna: ".. Yes."

Lance: *He cockily smirked, walking into the middle of the arena.* (I have no idea why he wants to fight, but I see him as a mate. So I'm not gonna turn him down-)

Tyler: *He staggered into the arena while nervously holding the RPG bag.* (Lance was always rough. He was always out there. He was something I could never be.. So, I want to see how well I can do against someone like him. I want to see how much I've grown!)

Madora: *She watched Tyler stop in the middle, cueing her to speak.* "Choose your arena!"

Tyler: *He looked up in Madora's general direction and nodded his head, sucking on his lips with concentration.* (I want to battle in-) *The arena blurred and swirled, catching Lance's attention.*

Lance: (Let's see what Tyler can come up with.)

Tyler: (Here-) *He smiled nervously, watching the area suddenly warp into Surpreon's centre.*

Lance: "Huh? We're outside the battle thingy's sphere?"

Tyler: *He stopped directly in front of Lance and shook his head.* "N-No, it's just the arena."

Lance: "Oh right."

Madora: "Lance versus. Tyler!-"

Chapter 8: Lance Versus. Tyler

Madora: "Begin!"

Lance: "Hey, wateva happens, don't worry 'bout it?"

Tyler: "O-Okay."

Lance: "Ladies first."

Tyler: "Here I come." *He quickly shoved his hand into the RPG bag and leant to the side, throwing out a red crystal.*

Lance: *He watched the red crystal fly towards him.* "Huh-?" *An explosion knocked him across the ground and into a food market stand.*

Ginger: "A Genesis Stone?"

Tyler: "Ougi!" *He shouted with an echoing voice, shoving both hands into the bag.*

Lance: *He leant forward, causing oranges to roll on the ground around him.* "Aha, wasn't expecting that-"

*Lance smirked and slowly stood up, wiping his lips with the back of his hand.*

Lance: "Not bad, Tyler-" *He grunted to himself and flashstepped in front of Tyler.*

Tyler: *He gasped in shock and stepped back, watching white liquid form in his hands.* (A flashstep-)

Lance: "Sorry, man." *He raised his arm and watched a stream of lightning shoot out of his hand, forming itself into a sword.*

Tyler: *He tightened his grip around a newly formed shotgun and pointed it at Lance's face.* "Ragnarok-"

Lance: *He looked at the shotgun with widening eyes and raised his arm in slow motion.* "MAGNETIC RUMBLE"

Tyler: *He shot a scattered burst of green bullets in Lance's face.* "A-Ah-" *He squealed at himself as the force knocked him slightly back.*

Lance: *A white shield expanded from his arm and blocked the scattered bullets, instantly shattering in reaction.* "Shit-" *He stumbled back and slipped on an orange, causing him to fall on the ground.*

*The sounds of thunder echoed due to Lance's shield.*

Rachael: (The Rasticsplash in these matches have been on a different level.)

Ginger: *She slightly smiled while observing Tyler's facial expressions.* (He is surprised at his own power, perhaps I should ask Dawn more about his Ougi.)

Tyler: *He frowned with determination and stepped down to one knee.* "Okay-" *The shotgun moved like liquid and formed itself into a bazooka, catching Nathan's attention.*

Nathan: "What kind of weapons is he using?"

Luna: "The first one was a shotgun-"

Rachael: "And this is a bazooka."

Nathan: (A bazooka?) "From your world?" *He grunted in confusion, quickly focusing back to the match.*

Rachael: "Yeah."

Nathan: "I see."

Lance: *He stood up and smirked with a frown, brushing dirt off his arm.* "Kool-"

Tyler: (Cool? How come he's getting up so easily-?) *He looked frightened and waited for the bazooka to charge up, listening to its laser-like sounds.*

Lance: *He pointed at Tyler with a carefree expression on his face.* "LIGHTNING BLAST"

Tyler: "What? No-?"

*A stream of lightning blasted towards Tyler and instantly struck through his chest and out his back.*

Tyler: "K-Karh." *He gasped and looked down in shock before collapsing on top of his bazooka, which disintegrated into tiny white orbs.*

Blake: (Whoa, violent.)

Madora: "It appears Tyler is unable to battle! Lance is the winner!"

*A revitalising wind brushed against Lance and Tyler, healing their wounds.*

Lance: *He ran towards Tyler as the area reverted back to normal.* "Are you OK?" *He grunted in a worried manner, helping Tyler back onto his feet.*

Tyler: "Y-Yeah."

Lance: "You did freakin' awesome." *He chuckled, smirking with a proud face.*

Tyler: *He gasped with a smile.* "D-Do you really think so?"

Lance: "Thinkso? I know so." *He wrapped his arm around Tyler's head.* "That explosion at the start, I thought this was gonna be an easy fight, but you sure showed me wrong."

Tyler: "B-But you easily beat me-?"

Lance: "A shotgun!" *He chuckled with amazement, purposely interrupting Tyler from talking.*

Tyler: "Well-"

Lance: "When could you change your Owgee thingy's form?" *He spoke with a smile and looked at Tyler, walking out of the arena.*

Madora: "Next is-"

Season: (After everything we've seen-) *He hobbled out into the arena, causing the crowd to cheer loudly at his presence.* (-I've been getting the vibe I'm the weakest out of the three of us-)

PKMY: *She power walked into the arena and looked at Season, stopping in front of him.* (So, I'm curious, Caesar.)

Season: (Oh?)

PKMY: "Why did you want to fight me?"

Season: "I guess to see who's stronger?"

PKMY: "Well, that's you, right?"

Season: "But-"

PKMY: "Don't give me the whole, just because I was ranked two and you three."

Season: "That's exactly-"

PKMY: "My Ougi? You don't need an Ougi to be a better fighter, you're a Rostical User, not a brawler!" *She interrupted Season as if she knew what he was going to say.*

Season: *He nodded his head in understanding.* "We'll see."

Madora: "Pick your arena!"

Season: "I was going to choose the ocean's surface to fight."

PKMY: "Oh no, that's mean!" *She grunted, triggering flashbacks of awkwardly hopping on the water's surface.*

Season: "But-" *He smiled as the area blurred and warped into a grassy field with one tree.* "Well?"

PKMY: *She smiled to herself, staring at the small pond next to the lake.* "M-My home."

Season: "The Great High Plains."

PKMY: (I didn't think I'd ever see it again, after..-) "You're an awesome brother."

Season: "Hoho, I don't hear that often."

PKMY: *She chuckled and rolled her eyes.* "You big doofus-"

Madora: "Season versus. PKMY!-"

Chapter 9: Season Versus. PKMY

Madora: "Let the battle begin, now!"

Season: *A red glyph instantly flashed under his feet.* "Flames consume and burn my Astragons-"

PKMY: "Heh, straight to it. I like that-" *She stepped back as a red glyph flashed underneath her.* "Flames consume and burn my Astragons-"

Season and PKMY: "HEAT LANCE" *They pushed forward and four curved streams of fire blasted towards each other.*

PKMY: *She stepped to the side and flashstepped in front of Season.* "Heh."

Season: *He looked shocked as an eruption of flames exploded behind PKMY, due to the fire connecting.* (I can't-) *He stepped back in shock, quickly reaching over his shoulder.*

PKMY: *She placed both hands on her waist.* "We both know what a Rostical User's weakness is." *Sparks scattered around her Ryukkus.*

Season: (Blast the Astragons!-)

PKMY: "Harh." *She spun the Ryukkus, quickly jabbing them into Season's chest.*

Season: "Ah-"

Blake: *He smirked.* (It's over! That's my bitch.)

Mio: (Don't be so hasty!)

PKMY: *She hopped back ripping them out.* "That went pretty fast-"

Season: *He coughed out blood, placing both hands in front.* "I'm not done!"

PKMY: "Huh?"

Nathan: (He didn't even have time to unsheathe his weapon-)

Season: "SOLAR-"

PKMY: *Her eyes widened and she gasped in fear.* (Shit!-)

Season: "-FLARE" *He pushed forward and a beam of white light with a blue fluoro shading blasted towards PKMY.*

PKMY: "Dirty lamp!-" *Her face lit up and she quickly did the splits on the ground, ducking forward in desperation.*

Ginger: "Solar Flare?! Please respond!" *She leant forward, intensely staring at the beam in amazement.*

PKMY: "Tssk-" *She frowned with an opened mouth as grass and dirt swirled in her face.*

Season: *The beam's light intensified, causing him to squint his eyes.* (She couldn't have flashstepped in time-) *He lowered his arms, causing the light to slowly disintegrate away.*

Ginger: (A Solar Flare at such a close range, the Rasticsplash alone would have damaged her-) *She gasped in shock, staring at PKMY through the fading particles of light.*

PKMY: *She sighed in relief, focusing her eyesight to Season's legs.* "Harh!" *She quickly swept the ground and kicked Season off his feet.*

Season: "What!?" *He slowly fell to the ground with a face full of surprise.* (I missed-?!)

PKMY: "Airs pulsing, searing and soaring, rippling strike." *She raised her hands over her head, causing the atmosphere to blur and swirl with distortion.*

Rachael: (So this is what I should expect.) *She glanced across the plains, observing the entire battlefield.*

PKMY: "Harh!" *She dropped her hands at Season, releasing a ragged beam of red light towards him.*

Season: *His shoulder touched the ground and the beam slammed itself into his stomach.* "Kargh-"

*The beam blasted Season back across the ground, causing strands of grass to swirl in a trail around the beam.*

Rachael: (That's a powerful Azure!-)

PKMY: *She sighed and slowly stood up, noticing slight grazes on her hands.* (That Solar Flare-)

*PKMY looked behind her and noticed a slight 'V'-shaped pattern on the grass caused by Season's Rostical.*

PKMY: "That was close-"

Season: *The beam disintegrated, leaving a hole in his clothes.* (Damn-) *He frowned in thought and slid across the grass, before slowly coming to a stop.*

PKMY: *She focused her attention back to Season, watching him struggle to move.* "..."

Season: (I want to-, but I can't move.. When she stabbed me with her weapon-) *He sighed in a defeated manner, becoming limp.*

Madora: "It appears Season is unable to battle! PKMY wins!" *She watched the grassy plains warp back into the arena.*

PKMY: *She ran up to Season as a revitalising wind caused him to stand back on his feet.* "Hey."

Season: "Hello." *He coughed and brushed grass off his shoulder.*

PKMY: "Ah-" *She awkwardly looked away.*

Season: *He noticed PKMY's awkwardness and smiled, placing his hand on her shoulder.* "Come on, the next fight is about to start."

PKMY: "Yea."

Madora: *She watched PKMY and Season walk out of the arena.* "Next is-"

Pepper: *She ran into the arena, swaying her mallet by her side.* (I always found her intimidating, but the way she asked me for a challenge-)

Teresa: *Her image appeared in the middle of the arena, causing dirt to swirl around her.* "Tcch-" *She raised her hand, gracefully flicking her hair over her shoulder.*

Rachael: *She looked surprised.* (She is so fast-)

Nathan: (I can't wait to challenge her in our matches.) *He slightly smirked with excitement.*

Pepper: *She ran to the middle of the arena and stared at Teresa, placing the mallet on the ground in front of her.* "Teresa, good luck to whoever-"

Teresa: "We are about to engage in combat. Discussions are pointless at this present point in time." *She stepped forward and looked up to the sky, waiting for Madora's words.*

Madora: "Choose your arena!"

Pepper: "Pointless? Fair enough-" *She closed her eyes and the arena blurred and the colours darkened as the sky turned to night.* "This is nostalgic."

Teresa: *She looked around puzzled, as bright moonlight lit the ruins of an ancient city.* "What is this?"

Pepper: "This is the city of the Elementalists. My last mission as a Sacred Knight."

Teresa: "Hoh?"

Madora: "Pepper versus. Teresa!-"

Chapter 10: Pepper Versus. Teresa

Madora: "Commence!"

Nathan: "This will be an interesting match."

Lezard: "Ooo-" *He sarcastically shivered.* "Lezard agrees! He can feel it in his bones."

Pepper: "I say, prepare yourself-"

Teresa: *Her image appeared face to face to Pepper.* "Indeed, I have already done so-" *She kicked Pepper in the chest at blinding speeds, causing her to blast back into the air.*

Pepper: "Ka-erk-" *Her arms and hair swayed forward, as she smashed through a rock pillar and into a castle-like wall.*

Nathan: "Whoa, see!" *He chuckled with amazement.*

Pepper: *She fell off the wall and collapsed onto the stone ground.* "Argh." *She looked up, ignoring streams of sand which poured on top of her from the cracking rubble.*

Teresa: *She stepped forward, purposely crushing a piece of ruin-like debris.* "Hmph-" *Her image disappeared causing the sand to pulse away.*

Luna: "Whoa, the one with the ponytails-?"

Rachael: "Pepper."

Luna: "Yea, well she didn't even have time to grab her weapon." *She stared at the mallet resting on the ground with the handle poking up.*

Pepper: *She slowly stood up and grunted, looking around in a serious manner.* "Where is she?"

*Pepper whispered to herself and noticed the mallet in the distance.*

Pepper: (I better get-) *An image of Teresa appeared in front and behind her, both raising the Pentarang with killing intent.*

Teresa: "Humph!" *Both copies of Teresa glowed a shade of blue.*

Pepper: *She gasped in thought, discreetly glancing over her shoulder.* (From behind too-?!)

Teresa: "Mirror's Divide." *Both images of Teresa slashed the Pentarang across Pepper.*

Pepper: "Gah-" *Sparks scattered off her amour and a trail of blood stringed from the Pentarangs.*

Teresa: "Humph-" *Both images spun around, raising the Pentarang over their heads for a follow-up attack.*

Pepper: *Her eyes shined a beautiful golden colour.* "Sacred blood throughout my veins, I say heed thout command, SOUTHERN CROSS"

Teresa: *Her eyes widened as a gold glyph expanded on the ground.* "Tcch-"

*The glyph made unusual sounds before a blast of blinding light pushed Teresa back.*

Blake: *He watched only one copy of Teresa slide out of the blinding light.* (The Rostical worked, I only see one copy-)

Pepper: *She noticed streams of blood on her hand and followed them up her arm, noticing a deep slash mark across her shoulder.* "I say, good-"

Teresa: *She jumped high into the air and landed on top of a pillar, straightening one leg to the side.* "Long-range Lotus." *She kicked downwards and a fluoro blue wave hit Pepper on the shoulder.*

Pepper: *Her feet scraped on the side along the ground, watching sparks flash off her metallic boots.* (She isn't holding back-)

Teresa: *She quickly repositioned herself, pointing her finger at Pepper.* "Typhoon's-"

Pepper: (Now I will get serious!-) *She bent forward and flashstepped.*

Teresa: *She lost her focus as Pepper flashstepped out of her line of sight.* "Tcch-"

Pepper: *She flashstepped next to her mallet and firmly grabbed it, lifting it off the ground.* "...-" *She looked over her shoulder to Teresa and flashstepped again.*

Teresa: *She looked towards the area where Pepper's mallet was and noticed the swirls of sand.* "Tcch-"

Pepper: *She flashstepped in the air in front of Teresa and her body glowed a shade of blue.* "Harh!"

*Teresa and Pepper's hair slowly flapped to each side as they stared at each other in slow motion.*

Pepper: *Her mallet glowed red and she held it like a baseball bat.* "Shattering Stones."

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She bent her knees and jumped high into the air.*

Pepper: "Harh!" *She swung down and hit the pillar, causing a crack to zigzag to the bottom before bursting into pieces.*

Karol: "S-So strwong-"

Nathan: "Shh-"

Pepper: *She looked down past the crumbling pillar and stared at a large growing dirt cloud on the bottom.* (Missed!)

Teresa: *Her hair and cape flapped downwards, as she continued to rise higher into the air.* (Her aura has changed-)

*Teresa thought to herself in concern and elegantly straightened her hands in front, staring at Pepper.*

Teresa: "Shattering bonds, with calm Astragons, and forceful Neurons-" *A white glyph formed and drew itself in front of her hands.*

*Teresa's Pentarang reflected the light emitted from the glyph, instantly catching Pepper's attention.*

Pepper: *She looked up and noticed the glyph, hiding her shock.* "Thy see-" *She quickly flashstepped onto the ground for better footing.*

Teresa: *Her face glowed as the rotating glyph shined in front of her.* "SERENITY SWIRL"

Pepper: *She raised her arms towards Teresa.* "Shattering bonds, my Radiatons explode and implode the power of light, SERENITY SWIRL" *She pushed forward and a vortex of light blasted into the sky towards Teresa.*

Ginger: (Two of the same Remenistal but with different incantations?)

Teresa: *She raised her arm, causing two beams of light to spiral out of the glyph and into the air above her.* (I remember her Serenity Swirl on the ship-) *She dropped her arm, causing the beams of light to spiral downwards.*

Pepper: "..."

*The beams of light connected and made a violent whoosh-like sound, cueing a delayed howling gale to blow throughout the ruins.*

Teresa: *She stood on the air and frowned, focusing all her concentration on the glyph in front of her.* (I was expecting some resistance at first, but it feels like my Neurons just hit a brick wall!)

Ginger: (I love it when Remenistal connects like this.) *She smiled and leant forward, watching debris blow across the ruins in excitement.* (It is a beautiful sight, Remenistal at its top existence-)

Pepper: *She smiled in a victorious manner, watching her light suddenly shoot through Teresa's.* "Humph."

Teresa: (It burst through my Rostical!-)

*The vortex of light moved through the air at an unrealistic speed and hit Teresa, causing waves of light to explode around her.*

Teresa: (Inconceivable-) *She lost her composure and stared at the moon, falling towards the ground.*

Rachael: "Wow."

Teresa: *She coughed out blood and slowly kicked the air, causing her feet to face the ground.* "Tcch-"

Pepper: "I say, finish this match, it is over!" *She lowered her arms, looking away in a confident manner.*

Teresa: *She landed heavily on the ground, causing it to crack.* "I have been through worse. VOLCANIC ERUPTION" *She raised one arm in front of her and shouted, causing the ground to crack under Pepper.*

Pepper: *She stared at Teresa in shock, ignoring the bright red light coming from the ground.* (She's no longer weakened to the Radiaton's effects?)

Teresa: (I have placed an immense level of Neurons into this Rostical!)

Pepper: "Ougi, Angelic Celestic Siren." *She hummed on a soft-high note and silver wind blew from her mouth around her.*

Teresa: "You had plenty of opportunities to flashstep out of my Rostical's range-" *She stopped in mid-sentence and gasped as her eyes turned to silver.*

Pepper: "I say, if I flashstepped then you wouldn't have prepared the Remenistal, yeah?" *She smirked and casually stepped off the cracks, noticing their lava-like glow.*

Teresa: (What-?!) *She gritted her teeth in struggle, slowly lowering her arm.*

Pepper: *She looked at the cracks in the ground, causing her to glance at Teresa.* "It looks like it's ready."

Teresa: "T-T-Tcch-" *She grunted and hesitantly dragged her feet, slowly walking towards where Pepper stood.*

Pepper: "Defeated by your own Remenistal."

Teresa: (I can not move my body!-)

Pepper: *She held her eye in pain, as a tear of blood ran down her cheek.* (She's powerful, my Ougi will not last long-) *She nodded her head, causing Teresa to raise her hand.*

Teresa: "Tcch-" *A red glyph flashed under her feet and an eruption of lava exploded beneath her, causing several of the spectators to gasp in disgust.*

Rachael: *She slightly squinted her eyes.* (It's just as bright as the Meister siblings.)

Madora: (Terra-) *She didn't wait for the lava to stop.* "It appears Teresa is unable to battle! Pepper wins!"

*The area started to revert back to normal, causing the Rostical to prematurely finish.*

Teresa: *Her skin was black and she fell to the ground.* (Is this how devastating my own power is-?)

Pepper: *She flashstepped in front of Teresa, catching her in her arms.* "I say, are you okay?"

Teresa: *A revitalising wind healed her wounds, causing her skin to revert back to normal.* "S-Such an Ougi-"

Pepper: *She tilted her head on a side with a smile.* "Thy tend to only use it on Scoldrants or other beings."

Teresa: "Hoh?"

Pepper: "Because I don't feel right controlling other people."

Teresa: "So, I should take it as a compliment? The fact you were forced to go against your own moral code to take me down?"

Pepper: "Hmph. You're not only quick on your feet?" *She smiled as if she was impressed with Teresa's deduction.*

Teresa: *She slowly regained her awareness and stood on her feet.* "I believed I had seen it all."

Pepper: "My Ougi works similar to how Rostical Users use illusions."

Teresa: (Jewel..) "You affect the senses by asserting you own Astragons into the opponent?"

Pepper: "Close, I insert my Radiatons into the opponent's bloodstream via my siren. I then manipulate the opponent's Astragons and control it through a connected resonance of Neurons."

Teresa: (Impressive.)

Pepper: "I am curious to know more about your ability."

Teresa: "Understood-" *She glanced at the audience and stepped to the side, focusing her attention to the gate.* "Let us go, we can talk in the waiting area."

Pepper: *She nodded her head and picked up the mallet which rested on the ground next to her.* "Yes."

Madora: *She watched Pepper and Teresa flashstep out of the arena.* "Next is-"

Holland: *He walked into the arena and slowly exhaled, keeping himself relaxed.* (He's been an awesome, and entertaining friend. So, I want to see how well he goes.)

Freya: (Why?) *Her voice echoed in Holland's mind.*

Holland: (Maybe to take him seriously? To compare strengths? I'm not sure.)

Lance: *He ran into the arena and stopped in the middle.* "Oi, ya big ogre."

Holland: *He smirked and raised an eyebrow.* "Hmm?"

Lance: "Pick ya arena already-"

Madora: "Choose your arena!" *Her voice caused Lance to cockily smirk at Holland.*

Holland: *He touched his chest and tribal markings, watching the arena blur around him.* "Come out!" *He punched forward and a purple glyph spiralled in front of him.*

Lance: *A large fern suddenly slapped him across the face as the area turned into a thick damp forest.* "Aye?" *He grunted with a frown, violently flicking the fern behind him.*

Freya: *She jumped out of the glyph and landed on all fours, facing Lance in a welcoming manner.* "Ruff."

Lance: "Oh shut it, fleabag-"

Freya: "Grr." *Her docile like personality towards Lance quickly changed into aggressiveness.*

Luna: (It's like a clearin' surrounded by thick bamboo looking trees.)

Destiny: (I like it yeup!) *Her voice echoed in Luna's head.*

Madora: "Holland versus Lance!-"

Chapter 11: Holland Versus. Lance

Madora: "Let the battle begin!"

Lance: *He noticed thick patches of differently-shaped ferns, causing him to grunt in frustration.* "Why'd you pick such a stupid level?!" *He stared at Holland who stood on the spot with his arms folded.*

Holland: "'Cause." *He smirked with confidence.*

Lance: "Sorry, man, but wateva-" *He straightened his arm and pointed it at Holland.* "LIGHTNING-"

Freya: "Bwarh!" *Her bark gargled from behind Lance.*

Lance: "Wha!?" *He sounded shocked and turned around at a wall of ferns.* "I heard-"

*A vortex of high pressured water swirled through the vegetation and hit Lance, knocking him onto the ground.*

Lance: "Bah-" *He flicked water off his hands, looking at the wall of ferns.*

Freya: *She ran through the long ferns, circling around Lance.* (What a good environment to choose.)

Lance: (The dumb dog is usin' the forest as a cover.. I can't see her.)

Holland: *He smiled, watching Lance stand back up with an angry face.* (I thought of you this time.)

Freya: "Ruff." *She barked in appreciation, causing Lance to quickly glance on his side.*

Lance: *He brushed wet hair off his forehead and spun around, keeping a close eye on the moving ferns.* (Gotcha!-) "LIGHTNING BLAST"

*Lance quickly raised his hand and pushed forward, blasting a stream of lightning through the ferns.*

Holland: (You're far off, Lance.)

Lance: "Aye?" *He watched the lightning string in between several branches in confusion.* "Why didn't it catch on fire?"

Holland: "I figured you would use your lightning to burn away the environment, so that's why I specifically chose the arena to be a rainforest."

Lance: "Rainforest? Wat's the point?"

Rachael: "Seriously?" *Her disappointed tone, caused Luna, Nathan and Blake to chuckle.*

Holland: "Everything is damp, wet."

Lance: "Wet, hey?" *He smirked and pointed to the ground.* "LIGHTNING BLAST" *He shot a stream of lightning in the ground and watched bursts of dirt and grass fly up into the air.*

Rachael: "At least he's trying."

Luna: "I am not related to him."

Rachael: "Hehe."

Lance: "Nothin'?"

Freya: (Sonic Roar.) *She stared at Lance's back and opened her jaw, barking out a visible shockwave.*

Lance: "H-Huh!" *He quickly spun and faced the sound in shock.* "You're-? Blargh!-" *He suddenly bent forward in pain, as the shockwave hit him in the stomach.*

Freya: *She pounced out from a cluster of ferns and stared at Lance's back, running towards him with extended claws.* "Gruff-"

Lance: (The damn dog was behind me-?!) *He wrapped his arms around his stomach, staring at the ground in pain.*

Freya: *She leapt through the air over Lance and pounced into the wall of vegetation behind him.* (This is too easy.)

Lance: *He grunted and stood up straight, pretending he wasn't hurt.* "Oi, come out."

Holland: (You can literally run in circles before he can react to your Azure Bursts.)

Lance: *He spun around and clicked his fingers, causing a stream of lightning to form itself into a sword.* "I won't hurt ya-" *He pointed the sword in front of him with a slight smirk.* (Much.)

Holland: (Keep it up, Freya.) *He stared at a cluster of bushes as if he knew the location to her whereabouts.*

Lance: *He stepped away from nearby ferns, swaying his sword to each side in a paranoid manner.* "Come on out-" *The wet leaves of the ferns slightly flickered light, due to his lightning.*

Freya: *She pounced out of the ferns towards Lance.* "Gruff."

Lance: *He looked up and smirked.* "You really are a dumb dog-"

Freya: (Aerial Pounce.) *Her speed drastically and suddenly increased, allowing her to jump on top of Lance.* "Grah-"

Lance: "Stupid-" *He stumbled back and pointed the lightning at Freya, readying to ram it through her side.* "Sorry, flea-"

Freya: "Grah-" *She bent her legs, flicking Lance's arm away with her tail.*

Lance: (The shit just tail whipped me!-)

Freya: "Gruff-" *She kicked forward, knocking Lance off his feet and into the air.*

Holland: (Awesome work!)

Lance: (What the friggin' dirty shit nuggets?!)

Freya: *She elegantly landed on all fours and wagged her tail.* "Ruff."

*Several villagers in the audience cheered with amazement.*

Lance: *He awkwardly landed on a small bush, causing his lightning sword to lose its swirl and spark away.* "You're cheerin' on the wrong person!"

Freya: "Gerooh!" *She howled into the air in a victorious manner.*

Lance: "Stupid dog!"

Freya: *She squinted her eyes at Lance and growled, separating her legs for a better stance.* (I'll have to burn-)

Holland: (It's fine, this isn't a real forest.)

Freya: (Okay-) *Liquid-like flames dripped out from the sides of her mouth, catching Lance's attention.*

Lance: "You might want to get that checked out-"

Freya: (Gargling Flaming Wheel.) *She leant forward, barking out a vortex of flames towards Lance.*

Holland: "..." *He watched the fire burn the surrounding vegetation.*

Lance: "Huh-?" *He stood up and stared at the flames, causing him to step back in shock.* "Shit-" *He stepped to the side and flashstepped out of the flame's range.*

Holland: *He looked to each side, trying to spot Lance.* (Be on guard, Lance is usually a full-frontal fighter.)

Freya: "Gruff!" *She bent her knees and lowered her head, preparing for Lance's inevitable attack.*

Lance: *He flashstepped behind Freya and ran towards her, raising his hand for an attack.* "Flames? Wait, I thought it was water-?" *He tripped on an ankle high bush, causing him to fall face first into the ground.*

Holland: (I used to trip over in forests all the time when I was younger. Checking your surroundings has become second nature to me.)

Freya: *She jumped into the air and spun around facing Lance, landing on all fours.* (Holland?)

Holland: (How about that Ice Fang?)

Freya: (Ice Fang.) *She opened her jaw and her two longest teeth shined a fluoro blue.*

Lance: *He looked up and noticed two streams of ice zigzag towards him.* "Huh-?"

Freya: "Grah-" *She closed her jaw and the streams bit into Lance's arm, causing him to yell.*

Holland: "Good work, Freya!"

Lance: (Holland?) *He discreetly looked to the side and formed a fist, causing a swirl of lightning to shatter the surrounding ice away.* (I'm an idiot!)

Freya: (Have I fought Lance before?)

Holland: (I don't think so, well, not at least seriously, why?)

Freya: (His lightning, he's never made me feel fear before-)

Holland: (His lightning frightens her-?)

Lance: "THUNDER BOOM" *He punched the air towards Freya and rumbles of thunder shattered the remaining ice.*

Freya: (Aerial Pounce.) *She jumped high into the air and looked down, watching a line of vegetation blow back due to the thunder.*

Lance: "Smear upon the skies and envelop your might, thunder roar down-" *He clapped his hands and a ring of blue lightning sparked around them.*

Holland: (Be careful, Freya, I've seen him use this before, it moves very fast!) *He watched Lance stare at Freya from the ground.*

Freya: *Her ears, tail and fur flapped in the air.* (Got it! Sonic-)

Lance: "LIGHTNING PULSE" *He quickly spun around and pushed forward towards Holland.*

Holland: "Huh?" *A ring of blue lightning rumbled like thunder towards him.*

Freya: (Holland!)

Holland: *He grunted in alert and stared at the lightning, quickly jumping to the side.* "Argh-" *The lightning touched his foot and travelled up his body, causing him to yell in pain.*

Lance: "Owgee, Brazza's Supreme Strobe Light Storm." *He raised his arms and lowered them, causing lightning as thick as trees to strike downwards.*

Luna: *She smirked, watching the lightning blast on top of Holland.* (I wonder whose Owgee is stronger? Mine or his?)

Destiny: (Yours is effective at binding the opponent with a mass combo of arrows inside a Reality Sekai, yeup!)

Luna: (True.. But, I've also got our Hi-Owgee in terms of power.)

Destiny: (Yes!)

Holland: (It burns!-) *He scrunched his eyes shut in pain as he twitched back and forth.*

Freya: *She growled at Lance and flapped her wings, causing her to stay in the air.* (Gargling-) *Lightning struck on top of her back and slammed her into the ground.* "Grarh-oowel!"

Holland: (I can't!-) *He gritted his teeth and tried to move.*

Freya: (I can't move my body!)

Lance: "Whoo." *He stretched and smirked, watching strings of lightning flash around Holland and Freya.*

Holland: (I can't-..) *He sighed and fell unconscious while his body continued to violently twitch.*

Madora: "It appears Holland is unable to battle! Lance wins!" *She watched the area revert back into the arena.*

Lance: *He took several steps towards Holland as a revitalising wind awakened him.* "You all good?"

Holland: *He quickly stood up and grunted, stretching his back.* "Yeah-" *He held his throat, causing Freya to disintegrate into nothing.* (How about you?)

Freya: (The wind healed me, thank you-) *Her voice echoed in Holland's mind.*

Holland: (But still?)

Freya: (To be honest, I'm pretty sure I felt your heart stop at one point..)

Holland: (Crud! Your instincts were right, his lightning is definitely dangerous-)

Lance: "Oi! Let's get goin'."

Holland: "Yeah sure, good match." *He mumbled and scratched the back of his head.*

Lance: "Aha, sure was. The trick where the dumb dog kept sneakin' around me in the bushes, I bet that would've been pretty funny to watch."

Holland: "Ha ha, it was."

Lance: "Pssht, wateva." *He smirked and quickly walked with Holland out of the arena.*

Madora: "Next is-"

Season: *He hobbled into the arena and stood in the middle.* (I'm rather shocked with this match request-)

Tyler: *He staggered out of the gate and into the arena.* (I asked Season for a match-)

Luna: "Tyler?" *She leant forward in shock.*

Rachael: "What?!" *Her eyes widened in confusion.*

Lezard: (He doesn't know Remenistal and can't use Azure Bursts? Despite having the title of quickfingers, I'm not sure how well he can hold his own against Season!)

Tyler: (This way, I can show him what Ragnarok can really do-) *He stopped in the middle and nervously held the RPG bag's strap around his shoulder.*

Season: "Are you okay, Tyler?"

Tyler: "..." *He silently looked away as if he was hesitant on fighting Season.*

Season: "Tyler-?"

Madora: "Choose your scenery."

Tyler: (This was my favourite area besides work-) *He closed his eyes and the area blurred.*

Season: "Hmm?" *He looked around, noticing differently-shaped coloured blocks which acted as obstacles.*

Luna: (Wow, awesome!)

Rachael: "Cool!" *She bounced to the edge of the seat with nostalgic excitement.*

Season: "Where is this?" *He noticed black paint smeared across the ground and on the coloured blocks.*

Tyler: "Dee Highs, the paintball area."

Ginger: "Ey, Rachael, why so excited, please respond?"

Luna: "She used to manage this area."

Ginger: "This entire area? Impressive." *She spoke with a smile, looking back to the arena.*

Season: "Oh?" *He looked around, intrigued.*

Madora: "Tyler versus. Season-"

Chapter 12: Season Versus. Tyler

Madora: "Begin!"

Season: "Remember, you can give up at any point during the battle-"

Tyler: "Ougi." *He threw both hands into the RPG bag and quickly ran behind a block out of Season's eyesight.*

Blake: "This will be a boring fight, hey." *He pouted.*

Karol: "H-How come?"

Blake: "He's got no Neurons and Astragons, lame if ya ask me."

Cameron: "Do not underestimate his power. He was able to defeat a number one ranking captain."

Rachael: "He what?"
Luna: "Wut?" *Their gasps caught Nathan's attention.*

Blake: (A captain?!)

Rachael: "Number one? Really?"

Cameron: "Indeed." *He nodded his head as he recalled Tyler blasting Dakota's head into tiny white orbs.*

Season: *He sighed and pointed his hand at the block.* (I really didn't want to fight you, Tyler-) "DIMENSION CRISIS" *Small purple rings clustered in between his hands and he flicked his hand at the block.*

*A purple firework exploded against the block, causing it to explode.*

Rachael: "I'm really curious about Tyler's Ougi, but Season has the complete upper hand."

Ginger: "I concur."

Cameron: (Despite his Ougi, Season does have the complete upper hand.)

Ginger: "I want to know how he can use the Ougi, it is not logical or explainable."

Season: *Black smoke quickly masked the area as the firework burnt the plastic.* "Tyler?" *He stepped forward, shouting out in a worried manner.*

Lezard: (Dimension Crisis looks like a similar Remenistal affinity Karol uses.. It can't be categorised in the basic elements and doesn't have Radiatons to be classed as light-based, maybe it's Shadiatons?)

Season: *He watched the smoke eventually clear, revealing nothing but black grass.* "T-Tyler?!" *He started to panic.*

Blake: "Fufufu, did he just blow up that guy to nothing?" *He leant forward with a smirk.*

Nathan: "Surely Madora would've said something already."

Blake: "Hmm, true aye."

Tyler: *He sat on the ground resting his back on a block with his hands still in the RPG bag.* "Mastered state of Alchemy and Crafting I show you, Ragnarok." *He threw his hands out and white liquid swirled around his fingers.*

Season: *He looked up and faced the direction where Madora would be, only staring at a large warehouse.* (Blast it-)

Tyler: *His face slightly flickered, due to the swirling light.* (I have to give it my all. For some reason, I'm more nervous than when I was fighting that captain.)

Season: *He took a deep breath.* (If the battle hasn't finished, then he's obviously still-)

Tyler: *He jumped up from a block far away, causing Season to gasp in relief.* (One of the reasons why I spent most of my time creating and practising this weapon-)

*Tyler squealed in thought and pulled the triggers to two handguns, shooting green fluoro bullets at Season.*

Season: *Several bullets shot into his arm, causing small streams of green smoke-like residue to evaporate off tiny holes in his robes.* "AQUA LIQUID" *He swayed his arm and a wave of water crashed in front of him blocking the other bullets.*

Tyler: *The handguns turned into liquid and started to change shape.* (I want to show Season how much I've grown. I want to be the best researcher-)

Season: *He looked down and gently placed his finger in one of the bullet holes, causing him to hiss in pain.* (These wounds are akin to a Rasticsplash.)

Tyler: *He quickly ran towards another maze of blocks, taking advantage of Season's distracted attention.* (I'll do what Freya did with Lance and utilise my surroundings.)

Rachael: *She watched Tyler hide himself in between two blocks, triggering flashbacks of many paintball games.* (Not many people know this, but Tyler was actually very good at paintballing.)

Season: *He moved his arm and observed his wounds with a proud smile.* (Alright-) *He focused his attention to the blocks, looking around where he last saw Tyler.* (He's hiding again?)

Tyler: *He held a large metallic tube.* (I devised this form specifically for this type of scenario-)

Season: (I used to deal with Scoldrants and warriors that hid within the environment-) *He stamped his foot and a swirl of liquid spiralled around his leg.* "AQUATIC DIVIDER"

Tyler: *He felt vibrations along the ground, causing him to look puzzled.* (I better fire it now-) *He pointed the large tube into the air and slightly tilted it behind him.*

Season: (This should get him out of hiding.) *He swayed both arms and watched a large wave sweep across the blocks.*

Tyler: "Huh?" *He looked to his side and stared at a large wave, rumbling towards him.* "N-No!-"

Season: *He mumbled in a curious manner, looking to each side.* (I heard him.)

Tyler: *The wave brushed past him, causing him to tumble to the side.* "Blah-" *He awkwardly landed on the tube and coughed out water, accidentally pulling the trigger.*

*A big green ball misfired out of the cannon-like tube and hit a nearby block, creating a large fluoro green explosion.*

Cameron: "That explosion, at such a close range to Tyler, he will-"

Tyler: *The explosion caused a pulse of water and wind to blast him out of hiding.* "Argh-"

Season: *He watched Tyler slide into his vision, noticing the tube in his hand.* (So he's able to change the shape of the weapon? How quickly and how often can he do that?) *He mumbled to himself, looking at the green explosion in amazement.*

Tyler: *He quickly stood up and stepped in a puddle, watching Season point both hands towards him.* (Too bad the grenade launcher didn't work out well. Luckily, I've been able to speed up the transition between different forms-) *The long tube turned into liquid and swirled around him.*

Season: *A swirl of visible wind howled in between his hands.* "FLURRY STYX" *He cupped his hands and pushed forward, blasting a condensed ball of wind towards Tyler.*

Tyler: *The liquid formed into a medieval-like shield.* "Argh-" *The wind hit his shield and he blasted back across the ground.*

Rachael: (A shield?)

Tyler: (It's strong-) *He thought with a struggling frown and watched the wind pulse away from his shield.*

Season: (He used a shield to wall my Rostical? That is such a strange Ougi-)

Tyler: *A spike erected out of the shield and he aimed the shield at Season in a defensive manner.* (I have to prove how good I am.)

*Tyler watched the spike shine a fluoro green, cueing him to nudge the shield forward, blasting the spike towards Season.*

Season: *He raised his arm and spun around, pointing his hand at Tyler.* "PIERCING CLOUDS" *A curved cloud-like smog waved in front of him.*

Tyler: (Please work!)

*The green spike hit the cloud and momentarily stopped before piercing through the Rostical and towards Season.*

Ginger: (Tyler who can not use Remenistal has the ability to pierce through it!) *She watched the green spike spiral out the smog, making its way towards Season's head.* (He simply astonishes me.)

*Ginger paused in thought and shook her head in amazement as if she couldn't believe what she was witnessing.*

Season: (How-?!) *He quickly stepped to the side, watching the spike blast past him.* (Close-)

Nathan: *He watched the spike shoot through the air and into the warehouse.* (Not many projectiles can pierce through Rostical. Luna and Rach are a different case though-)

Tyler: *Another spike erected out of the shield and shined a fluoro green.* (I can do this!-) *The spike shot itself out of the shield and blasted towards Season.*

Season: (I know I can avoid this, but-) "Winds, gentle and agile, gallop with pride and take on your natural prowess." *He spun around raising his arm.*

Ginger: (He used the Remenistal's incantation-)

Season: "PIERCING CLOUDS" *He dropped his hand at Tyler, causing a thick cloud of smoke-like smog to wave towards Tyler.*

*The green spike hit the cloud and momentarily stopped, causing several members of the audience to gasp with anticipation.*

Tyler: *He looked past the shield, staring at the spike in shock.* (My projectile is having trouble going through, he must've put more Neurons into the Rostical-)

*The smoke-like smog pulsed, causing the spike to wobble.*

Blake: "He's actually doing pretty good, hey."

*Suddenly the smoke and spike disintegrated into a pulse of green vapour.*

Tyler: (His Rostical withstood the spike?! This weapon was designed purposely for breaking through Rostical!)

Season: (They blocked each other!) *He frowned in thought, watching the cloud and vapour slowly fade away.* (I was hoping my Rostical would block his projectile and continue to blast towards him.)

Tyler: *He ran towards Season and aimed a bazooka for his head.* "I can do this!"

Season: *He gasped and stepped back as the bazooka made laser-like charging sounds.* "Might, strength, fury, courage, form these emotions in array of mighty pillars, GROUND SHAKING"

Tyler: "Harh-" *He shot a large green fluoro ball, causing him to stumble back.*

Season: *He reached behind his back and sparks scattered around his large red trident.* (I never would have thought-)

*A thick pillar of rock erupted up in front of Season, blocking Tyler's projectile.*

Season: (I never would have thought I'd have to go serious on you, Tyler-)

*The pillar of rock shattered into pieces behind an explosion of green swirls.*

Season: *He watched rocks fly past his face in shock.* (The projectile's strength shattered my boosted Rostical with ease!-)

Tyler: *He quickly dropped to one knee and aimed the bazooka at the large dirt cloud which enveloped Season.* (I can't believe I'm doing it!-)

Season: *He waved his trident and the dirt cloud instantly blew away.* "Good work, Tyler-"

*Season spoke with an emotionless face, pointing the trident at Tyler.*

Lezard: *He stared at Season, observing his body posture.* "He's serious now."

Season: "Powers of the never ending red, beat and skip through the winds, FIRE'S PULSE" *A ring of fire burnt the air at the end of trident.* "Harh."

Tyler: *His bazooka glimmered red before a ring of flames swirled in front of him.* "N-No-" *He spoke under his breath, staring at the flames with widening eyes.*

Season: (Sorry, Tyler-)

Tyler: *The ring of flames suddenly burst, pushing him off his feet.* "Oof-"

Ginger: *She watched Tyler fly back in the air, causing him to drop the bazooka.* "Now the match has been determined."

Lezard: "My delightful spice? Why do you say that?"

Ginger: "Because Tyler's trump card is now out of his grasp."

Tyler: "Argh-" *He awkwardly hit the ground and moaned in pain.*

Season: *He swayed the trident in the air as arcs of lightning zapped down it.* "Drums of terror from the skies, flash down and amplify, LIGHTNING SLICE" *He swayed the trident and a spear of lightning shot towards Tyler.*

Tyler: *He coughed and wheezed, tightly holding onto the RPG bag.* (I know how Season fights-) *He squinted his eyes in determination and randomly rolled to one side out of the way.*

Luna: "Wat a trooper." *She grunted with a giggle, watching Tyler roll out of the Rostical's range.*

*The lightning struck through the ground, causing a trail of dirt to explode into the air.*

Tyler: *He squinted his eyes in fear, listening to the echoing thunder.* (Come on, Tyler-)

Nathan: (If Tyler didn't move, that lightning would've pierced right through his body.)

Tyler: (Tyler! You can do this!) *He grunted and stood back up onto his feet, as a white liquid spiralled in the air around his hands.*

Ginger: "Yoh?!" *She whispered to herself.*

Season: *He watched the liquid form itself into a strange long weapon.* (Not only did he just roll out of range, the weapon somehow traces back to him because I saw him drop it-)

Rachael: "Is that what I think it is?" *She stared at the weapon Tyler held.*

Luna: "It is, but he's in close range?"

Rachael: "I didn't think I'd ever see one of those again."

Lezard: "Close range? Is it a long ranged weapon?"

Luna: "..."

Blake: "Wat is it, bitches?"

Luna: "Ya face." *She grunted at Blake.*

Blake: "Fine."

Tyler: "A little strange using it like this but, a sniper rifle shoots pretty quickly-" *He pulled the trigger and a stream of green smoke blew through Season's shoulder.*

Season: "Ah-?!" *The trail of smoke entered the warehouse, causing a blast of green light to shine inside.*

Cameron: (That projectile!-)

Apollo: (Cameron?)

Cameron: *He stared at the arena with the purple rings spiralling around his iris.* (Our eyes could barely keep track of it!-)

Tyler: *The weapon turned to liquid and formed into two handguns.* (My heart is pounding so hard-) *He started to run towards Season, pointing the handguns in front.*

Season: *His knees buckled and he looked down, noticing blood run down his arm.* (That instantaneous projectile severed several nerve endings. I can't move my arm-)

Tyler: "Let's do this, Ragnarok!"

Season: *He lowered his head and the trident.* (Time to end this-)

Tyler: "H-Have you given up-?" *The area turned to night.*

Season: "Water droplet change and transform this place, particles be one and let my power swirl throughout your spirit-" *Blue glyphs spiralled in the air around him.*

Karol: "It just became dark."

Ginger: (Those Neuron signatures.. Now he is serious.)

Season: "Open the gate to the lost Astragons taken by your serenity-" *The ground turned to liquid, causing small waves of water to splash around his ankles.*

Cameron: *He watched the ground around Tyler's feet ripple like water.* (It is like they are standing on water.)

Tyler: (Grand Rostical?!) *He stared ahead in a blind-like manner and aimed while shivering with growing fear.* (This is where he stood!-) *He started to shoot bullets in the darkness in front of him.*

Season: "Fill and crush anything that stands in its way, TSUNAMI'S IMPLOSION"

Tyler: (For some reason, I wasn't expecting him to use Grand Rostical!-) *He stepped forward and an implosion of white foamy water violently exploded around him.*

Rachael: "Why is he shooting when a Grand Rostical has commenced?"

Blake: "Probs desperation?"

Ginger: "Affirmative. At this tactical point in battle, he has nothing to lose by trying. His Ougi has already displayed destructive capabilities in regards to Remenistal."

Season: *He ignored the green bullets which shot past him, focusing all his attention on Tyler.* (Sorry-) *He enthusiastically swayed the trident above him, causing a giant swirl of water to erupt out of the water-like ground.*

*Season pointed the trident at Tyler and the water suddenly and violently imploded around Tyler, creating bursting ripples of water to pulse away from him.*

Tyler: "Argh-" *He dropped the handguns and fell forward, falling with the water around him.*

Madora: *She watched light fill the area and noticed Tyler lying unconscious on the wet grass.* "It appears Tyler is unable to battle, Season is the winner!"

*Madora watched the arena revert back to normal, causing the audience to cheer in amazement.*

Rachael: *She watched the nearby crowd roar in excitement.* "Hehe, they're pretty loud."

Ginger: "Ey, Rachael, it is Season, it is only logical they would-"

Rachael: *She shook her head, causing Ginger to stop speaking.* "That's not the only reason."

Ginger: "Please respond?"

Lezard: "Maybe Lezard could answer that."

Luna: "Alright, shoot?"

Lezard: "Being with their party for a little while, I noticed-" *He licked his lips, adjusting the cone-shaped hat.* "That unknowingly to Tyler, he's actually quite well known in Surpreon."

Blake: "So?"

Lezard: "People know about his lack of power."

Ginger: (So, they are just as amazed as I am then?) *She focused back onto the arena.*

Season: *He sighed as a revitalising wind healed his wounds and restored his robes.* "Tyler-" *He sheathed the trident back behind his shoulder, causing it to become invisible.*

Tyler: "A-Ah-" *He slowly dragged his feet under him as he awkwardly stood up.*

Season: "That was very impressive!" *He spoke with the utmost joy and respect.*

Tyler: "Y-You're just saying that." *He stood up and held his RPG bag in a sad manner, avoiding eye contact.*

Season: "Hohoho, no no."

Tyler: "No?" *He looked at Season as if he wasn't satisfied with the answer.*

Season: "Come, I'll explain how serious I am in the waiting area with everyone else!"

Tyler: *He smiled with failure.* "Okay."

Madora: *She watched Season and Tyler leave the arena.* "Next is-"

PKMY: *She stormed into the arena, forming a fist in determination.* (I want to see if you've become as strong as me-)

Alicia: *She walked with a slight skip to the middle of the arena.* "PKMY." *She smiled and lowered her head in respect.*

PKMY: "No, we're equals, don't do that with your head-"

Alicia: "Sh-Shut up, I'll do what I want."

PKMY: *Her eyes widened in shock.* "Heh-"

Madora: "Choose your scenery!"

PKMY: "Go on." *She leant on her side, placing one hand on her waist.*

Alicia: "R-Right-"

*The area blurred and suddenly glowed as it responded to Alicia's thoughts, revealing they stood on The Divine Path.*

PKMY: *She appeared slightly startled, looking down at the aura path.* (The road leading to Valhalla?)

Cameron: (Another location I am not familiar with.)

Apollo: (Perhaps a new Reality Sekai? I am not familiar with it either.)

Lezard: (The Divine Path?)

PKMY: *She looked at Alicia and smirked, standing in a battle-ready pose.* "You better watch out."

Alicia: "I-I will-"

Madora: "PKMY versus. Alicia-"

Chapter 13: PKMY Versus. Alicia

Madora: "Begin!"

PKMY: *She frowned with a widening smirk and ran towards Alicia, forming a fist.* "Harh."

Alicia: "I-ICICLE E-"

PKMY: *She jumped into striking distance and lunged forward, punching Alicia in the gut.* "Tssk, don't be a drag-"

Alicia: "Flashing of the lights-"

PKMY: *She looked up, staring at Alicia in shock.* (She's unaffected by my punch-?)

Alicia: "MYSTIC FALLS" *A spiral of light flashed from the ground and blinded PKMY, slamming itself into her stomach and chest.*

Cameron: (The light blinded then shot into PKMY? What an effective combo in itself-)

PKMY: *She wheezed and a sudden burst of light knocked her across the path.* "Tssk-" (I didn't read her emotions in time-)

Alicia: "Icy swirls draw to the skies, frosted water lend me your power, GLACIA'S EDGE"

PKMY: *She backflipped and stood up straight, holding her stomach with discomfort.* "Winds that be, power of might strike with fury, AIR CUTTER"

*A blade of wind shattered the ice pillar which erupted from the path towards PKMY's face.*

Alicia: *She watched glittering shards of ice splinter away from PKMY.* "D-Dirty shit nuggets." *She whispered to herself, keeping a calm collected composure.*

Rachael: (Out of the entire guild, I think I'm the worst at reading enemy signatures, so, I find it really impressive that someone can shatter a Rostical attack before it even comes into play.)

PKMY: (I'm no fan of long range-) *She grunted in thought and jumped forward, flashstepping in the air above Alicia.*

Alicia: *She looked up startled.* "Icy swirls call down upon me, frigid skies grant me power, ICICLE EDGE"

PKMY: "Icicle Edge? That's too easy to block-"

Alicia: "Unwritten holy laws, strike down my foe, SHINING RAIN" *Ribbons of light formed around the growing spears of ice which materialised above PKMY.*

PKMY: *She looked behind her and pointed her hand at the manifestations of Alicia's Rostical.* "FIRE LAN-"

Alicia: "'O holy powers draw towards me, HOLY LANCE" *She raised her arms as a blue, white and bright white glyph flashed under her.*

Blake: "Using three Rostical at the same time? Sexy, fufufu."

Mio: (So bothersome.)

PKMY: "Tssk-" *She quickly kicked her legs and spiralled, avoiding a large lance made of light.* (This is bad-)

Ginger: (Even aerial-based opponents have trouble avoiding Remenistal in the air, she is at a disadvantage.)

Alicia: *She closed her eyes and wobbled to each side as if she was seasick.* "I-I-"

PKMY: (Grr-) *Spears of light and ice shot past her in slow motion as she elegantly landed on the path.*

Alicia: *She opened her eyes and smiled with confusion.* (The incantation! I know the words for my Grand-)

PKMY: *She kicked her legs and spiralled along the path, skilfully avoiding the spears.* "Heh-"

Cameron: *He watched the last ice spear fall down, causing him to shake his head.* (What a wasted opportunity.)

PKMY: *She smirked in a condescending manner, slowly standing up straight.* (By using a combination of three falling type Rostical, she had the upper hand while I was in the air-)

Alicia: "HOLY LANCE"

PKMY: *She stared at Alicia, purposely kicking a shard of ice in a taunt-like manner.* (But failed miserably because she just stood there and watched-)

Alicia: *She watched a long lance of light plummet on top of PKMY, causing the path to flash a blinding light.* (I'm sure that hit her-)

Blake: "The crazy bitch!" *He hissed in shock, slightly rubbing the nail polish off his fingers in a worried manner.* "Is Amy-?"

PKMY: *She flashstepped near Alicia with a short of breath.* "Hurling shockwave snap-" *She clicked her fingers and swayed her arm back, causing a water-like ripple to envelop her hand.*

Alicia: "H-Huh?" *She looked to her side, staring at PKMY in shock.* (She's really fast!-)

PKMY: "Flying palm strike-" *She pushed her palm at Alicia and thin tunnels of wind whirled towards her.*

Alicia: *She squinted her eyes as her hair violently blew back.* "POLAR SN-"

PKMY: "Double Smack." *She flashstepped to Alicia's side and backhanded her across the face, unaffected by her own wind.*

Alicia: "Eek-" *She stepped back in pain, waving her hand in front of PKMY.* "Icicle Stroke-"

PKMY: "Hmph-" *She flashstepped to the other side and spun around, slapping Alicia across the mouth.*

Alicia: *She held her lips in pain, disorientated by PKMY's wind.* "Kiss the rain, WATER STORM"

*A waterfall-like vortex shot up from the path, causing the wind from PKMY's Azure Burst to die down.*

Luna: (That's a kool water Rostickal!)

Destiny: (Water version of Trevour's Dust Storm!)

Alicia: "Icicle Stroke." *She quickly looked at PKMY and swayed to the side, slicing a wave of ice towards PKMY.*

PKMY: "Really?" *She faced Alicia and punched the ice, watching it shatter past her arm.* "Pathetic, princess-"

Alicia: "Kiss the rain, WATER STORM"

*A waterfall-like vortex shot up from the path, separating PKMY from Alicia.*

PKMY: "Really?" *She quickly cartwheeled around the water and spun around on her toes, stepping back into striking distance.*

Rachael: *She stared at the water and shook her head in confusion, looking down the row to her guild members.* "What did she hope to achieve by doing that?"

Luna: "Yea, she wasted a lot of Newgongs with that water, and the red-haired chick just cartwheeled around it."

Lezard: "Now now, children, there's a reason for everything."

Luna: "Or maybe you're just givin' her too much credit?"

PKMY: "Three finger snap-flashing fist-"

Alicia: "Hi-Ougi."

PKMY: "Eh?" *She gasped and quickly backflipped away from Alicia, landing on her knees.* (I had an opportunity to attack, but she said Hi-Ougi-)

Alicia: *She smirked, watching her pendant sparkle to her will.* "Tee hee."

PKMY: *She patiently waited and noticed the water of Alicia's Rostical lose its current, splashing across the path.* (She's laughing? Was she bluffing, or-?)

*The area turned into darkness, instantly catching PKMY's attention.*

Cameron: "How can she Hi-Ougi without a second person?"

Blake: "Maybe it's like, how we can? By using the close bond of our Soul Links, we're able to use Hi-Ougis without the partner being nearby."

Luna: "But she ain't no Scoldrant User."

Blake: "I dunno, hey? I was just trying to help." *He hissed, focusing back to the arena.*

Alicia: "Power of the deep depths, let our power roar like thunder, and shatter like ice, heed our words, ETHEREAL RAPIDS"

PKMY: *She watched white foamy water rumble towards her from a distance.* "Heh." *She closed her eyes and slowly and deeply inhaled.*

Ginger: "Ethereal Rapids is a Remenistal that can not be beaten once it is set up."

PKMY: "Bestow, the cloudy abyss of gravel, MANIPULATE"

Blake: "You can preach that, my spice. I totes remember captains losing to that Rostical." *He watched the air become visible, causing him to tilt his head on the side in a curious manner.*

Karol: (The air?)

Blake: "Wat's she planning?"

Ginger: "I do not know."

Cameron: "Nor do I-"

Luna: "Just freakin' watch, aye."

PKMY: *She glanced at the visible air currents with a smirk.* "Winds that be, power of might strike with fury, AIR CUTTER"

Alicia: *She swirled her arms in a fluid-like motion, controlling the devastating current towards PKMY.* "S-Sorry, PKMY!-"

Cameron: *The purple ring spiralled around his iris, allowing him to see waves in the water's current.* (Her Astragons are flowing in the water.)

Apollo: (It should? It's her manifestation.)

Cameron: (Not to this extent. People usually control the elements via the Astragons around the Remenistal. She has somehow implemented Astragons inside the actual water as well.)

Apollo: (Wait, do you see that? It looks like there is an infusion of Radiatons in the water, too.)

PKMY: *The air current swirled around her and she stood in an offensive manner.* (I've got to relax-) *She nervously thought to herself, staring at the incoming current.*

Alicia: *She swayed her arms, staring at PKMY in a serious manner.* (I will quickly crush her under the water-)

Blake: (It's unlike Amy to not move out of the way.) *He thought in a worried manner and stared at PKMY with heightened vision, watching a tidal wave curve over her.*

Ginger: (It is too late for her to flashstep, it is over-)

PKMY: (I can feel the water vibrating under my feet.. This will be a test of my concentration-) *She suddenly ran towards Alicia and the water crashed around her.*

Alicia: *She watched the water violently swirl around PKMY.* "H-Huh? It didn't crash on top of her?!"

Karol: "What happened?"

Ginger: *She chuckled with a smirk.* "She is using the wind to manipulate the water."

Blake: (So that was her plan.)

Cameron: "Impressive, but it can not last for long."

Ginger: "I concur."

Nathan: "Why?"

Rachael: "Look at the volume of water?"

PKMY: *She noticed a wave of the water break out of the current and crash towards her.* "GLACIA'S EDGE" *She punched to the side, causing a pillar of ice to freeze the water.*

Rachael: *She quickly glanced at Nathan.* "See, water already broke out of her air current."

Alicia: *She watched PKMY jump into striking distance.* "Tundra's edge, split, carve, define your limitations-"

*The rush of water quickly swirled around PKMY and Alicia, blocking the spectator's view, causing several people to boo with anticipation.*

Lezard: (This is amazing to watch-)

*The water suddenly imploded around PKMY and Alicia, causing them to float and cough out bubbles.*

Rachael: *She stared at an enormous sphere of water, noticing PKMY and Alicia inside.* (Wow.)

Alicia: *She held her breath as the water's inner current swirled her in circles.* (Why is the water attacking me too-?)

PKMY: *She kicked her legs and swayed her arms, preventing the water from tumbling her in its current.* (That incantation before-)

*PKMY drifted in the water, triggering a flashback of Alicia's previous incantation.*

PKMY: (Her Neurons and Astragons felt like she was about to use Grand Rostical-)

Alicia: (My Grand Rostical! I have to complete it!-) *She crossed her arms above her head.* (But for me to complete it, I need to stop this-)

PKMY: (But those words, I've never heard or seen an ice-based-)

*The water's current started to vacuum around Alicia, causing PKMY to intensely stare at her.*

PKMY: (Her ability to manipulate this volume of water with such ease!-)

Alicia: (This is our technique, I should control it!) *She swayed her arms in front, causing the water to violently pulse and swirl around them.*

PKMY: *She coughed and landed on the path, hiding her amazement.* "Heh-"

Alicia: "Tundra's edge, split, carve, define your limitations, with the four stars facing east, west, north and south-" *The water instantly froze in its swirling momentum.*

Luna: (Holy shit!) *She smirked, staring at the fluid-like ice formations.*

PKMY: (It is a Grand Rostical!)

Ginger: *She stood up in shock.* "Ice?!"

Blake: "So wat?"

Ginger: "I do not possess an ice Grand Remenistal!"

Alicia: "Radiate the points and change the osmosis' patterns of nature's wrath-" *A thick layer of ice froze the path and pillars of ice erupted up from the ground.*

Blake: (A frozen fortress?) *He discreetly glanced at Rachael, triggering flashbacks of crystal.*

Mio: (It looks similar to what happened.)

Blake: (I know-)

PKMY: *She flinched to one side as an ice pillar exploded next to her.* (Shit-)

Alicia: "Howling blizzard, sleep and dominate-" *She casually flicked her fingers, causing a wall of ice to erupt behind PKMY.*

PKMY: "Tssk, trying to trap me?" *She frowned and spun around, punching the ice pillar.*

*PKMY gasped in shock and withdrew her fist, watching the ice crack.*

PKMY: (The quality of ice is completely different to her usual power-)

Alicia: "PIERCING POWDER SNOW"

*A thick gust of snow blew like a blizzard around the entire area.*

PKMY: *Her skin slightly turned blue and small ice needles scratched her body in the howling blizzard.* (This just can't be-)

*PKMY started to shiver, causing her to point her hand at Alicia.*

PKMY: "FLAMING WHEEL"

*A glimmer of light flickered around Alicia before a cold gust of snow extinguished it.*

Alicia: *A thin layer of ice froze the water on her body.* "..." *She noticed PKMY shivering, causing her to look at her arm.* (Is it cold? I can't tell-)

PKMY: *She looked astonished and stared at the snow, vigorously rubbing her arms to keep warm.* (There's a build-up of Neurons-)

*Snow clustered and fell like rain before the entire path erupted into a glacier's peak.*

Lezard: *He leant back in shock, watching a pulse of mist rise up into the sky.* "Wow-"

Alicia: *She clicked her fingers, causing the ice to shatter and the light to return to normal.* (That-)

*Alicia took a step forward and her knees buckled, causing her to sigh out mist in exhaustion.*

Alicia: (That took a lot out of me-)

PKMY: *She coughed and collapsed to her knees.* (Too, cold-)

Alicia: "Give up-"

PKMY: *She looked up with a frown and fire swirled on the path around her.* "FLAMING WHEEL" *She nudged her head up, causing the flames to erupt into a tornado.*

Karol: *He watched the tornado of fire swirl around PKMY in confusion.* "What is she doing?"

Cameron: "Perhaps warming herself up?"

Ginger: "That is the logical answer."

PKMY: *Her hair swirled in a circle as the flames stopped her from shivering.* (She has become so much stronger. I wouldn't have ever expected her to perform an ice-based Grand Rostical.)

Alicia: *She held her arm, patiently watching the fire swirl around PKMY.* (What is she doing?)

PKMY: "Right-" *She grunted and stood up, causing the fire to string around her.*

Alicia: *She stared at PKMY and discreetly frowned as if her efforts were in vain.* (She's not shivering anymore-)

PKMY: "My turn!-" *She announced before flashstepping in front of Alicia.* "Harh!" *She punched Alicia in the gut with a smirk.*

Alicia: "Karh-" *She wheezed and coughed, trying to inhale for air.*

PKMY: "Come on, you had plenty of time! You could've at least raised your arms-"

Alicia: *She quickly grabbed PKMY's wrist with both hands.* "You're r-really strong."

PKMY: *She tried to pull her fist away.* "How? Let go-"

Alicia: *She looked up to PKMY with a nervous smile.* "No-" *Her eyes shined golden and silver radiant wings erupted out of her back.*

PKMY: (Her Radiaton wings!-) *She formed a fist with her other hand.* "Hah-"

Alicia: "ICICLE EDGE" *An ice spear blasted down and stabbed PKMY through the elbow.*

PKMY: "Argh!-"

Cameron: (That was fast.)

Apollo: (Almost as fast as yours?)

Cameron: (Negative.. It was faster.)

Alicia: *She panted with exhaustion and stepped forward as her wings moved like razor blades.* "Herh-arh!"

*Ice moved behind Alicia and she flew across the path, suddenly blasting high into the air.*

PKMY: *She looked down in shock, triggering a flashback of punching Alicia in the gut.* (She didn't avoid my punch on purpose!-)

Alicia: *She quickly spun around and faced the path.* "..."

PKMY: *She looked at the path, hiding her fear.* (Does she really intend to drop me from this height-?)

Alicia: *Her wings flared and she dived forward, plummeting towards the path.* (Okay-)

*Alicia let go of PKMY's wrist, causing them to slightly separate in mid-air.*

PKMY: "Heh, n-no way!-" *She quickly grabbed Alicia's hand.*

Alicia: *She stared at her hand in shock.* (My plan?!)

PKMY: "Yahoo!-"

Madora: *She squinted one eye with pain-like anticipation, watching PKMY and Alicia slam into the aura-like path.* "Ouch-"

*PKMY and Alicia slightly bounced off the aura and rolled to their sides, lying motionless.*

Blake: (They instantly fell unconscious-)

Rachael: "Their fall had such force, I think both of their Astral shields broke."

Madora: "It appears Alicia and PKMY are unable to battle, it's a draw!" *She watched the area revert back to normal as a revitalising wind restored their wounds.*

Rachael: "They're still unconscious-"

Teresa: *She flashstepped over PKMY and softly slapped her on the cheek.* "Amy-"

PKMY: "A-Ah-?"

Lance: *He flashstepped over Alicia and rubbed her cheek with his thumb.* "O-Oi."

Alicia: "L-Lance?"

PKMY: *She stood up and noticed the dirt layered arena.* "Shit-" *She coughed and ran up to Alicia.* "We better go-"

Alicia: "R-Right." *She nodded her head with a sense of urgency as PKMY helped her onto her feet.*

PKMY: "Thanks." *She grunted, looking at Teresa and Lance.* "But, you two better get off-"

Madora: "Next is, Teresa versus. Lance."

Alicia: "O-Oh-"

PKMY: "Heh, come on." *She wrapped her arm around Alicia's waist and flashstepped out of the arena.*

Chapter 14: Teresa Versus. Lance

Madora: "Choose your scenery!"

Teresa: *She faced Lance who stared at her with a smirk.* "Hoh?"

Lance: "Oh, hohoho yourself."

Madora: "Pick your arena!"

Teresa: *She nodded her head at Madora, mentally preparing herself.* "A suitable area to fight, would be-"

Lance: "I'm pickin' it."

Teresa: ".. It does not bother me-"

Lance: "Done!"

Teresa: "Hoh?" *She looked around, slightly confused.* (It is just the arena in its normal form?)

Madora: (Oh deary me, Teresa was meant to choose the scenery-) "Let the battle begin!"

Teresa: *She stared at Lance's smirk with an emotionless face.* "What is with the smile?"

Lance: "'Cause I get to beat you again."

Teresa: "Again?" *She slightly frowned and spread her legs, scraping them along the ground.* (Annoying man-child-)

Lance: "Naww, did I say somethin', not to your likin'?"

Teresa: "I believe the match has started, but before you win, why did you choose this?" *She glanced across the arena.*

Lance: "I've always been a fan of cameos 'n' nostalgic stuff, aye. To answer your question, don't ya remember? This is what the arena looked like when I beat you before-"

Teresa: "I see. Winds howling and feeling the cold serenity, soothing compassion rise this empty shell-" *She whispered as the sand swirled around her.*

Lance: "Wat are ya blabberin'?" *He raised his arm and lightning strung out of his hand, forming into a sword.*

Teresa: "Humph-" *She smiled and flashstepped face to face to Lance.* "CATAGORY NINE"

Lance: "Tssk, LIGHTNING-"

Teresa: "Did you know this has the power of a cyclone?"

Lance: "W-Wat-?!"

Teresa: *She pushed forward and a sudden gust of wind blasted Lance back at flashstepping speeds.* "Humph-" *She gracefully spun around with a slight smirk as if the match was over.*

Lezard: *He watched a massive dirt cloud wave across Lance's side of the arena.* "Oh dear, where did the silly sausage go?"

Nathan: "Yeah, did he flashstep-?"

Lance: *Rocks and dirt exploded around him as he smashed into the wall of the arena.* "Kargh-" *He coughed out blood and wheezed with widening eyes, falling face-first into the dirt.*

Madora: "W-Wow-" *She coughed, realising her voice echoed throughout the arena.* "It appears Lance is unable to battle, Teresa wins!"

Teresa: "Good fight, it was close-" *She smirked at her attempted sarcasm and started to walk towards the gate.* "But it appears I have grown slightly stronger since the last time we engaged in combat-" *She spoke in a taunt-like manner, flashstepping out of the arena.*

Rachael: "The shame, that was a one hit knock out."

Luna: "Aha." *She chuckled, nodding her head in agreement.*

*A revitalising wind blew across the arena, causing Lance to twitch into consciousness.*

Lance: *He coughed in shock and looked around with astonishment.* "Where? What? How-?" *He stood up and wiped dirt off his face, moving his arms in a karate-like manner.* "Where are ya-?"

Madora: "The match is over, please leave the arena!"

Lance: "O-Over-?" *He spoke in confusion, triggering a flashback of being slammed into the wall.* (Damn, I got bloody owned!) *He frowned in thought and turned around, quickly running towards the gate out of the arena.*

Madora: "Next is-"

Holland: *He walked into the arena with his hand on his shoulder, stretching his arm.* (This battle is important to me.)

PKMY: *She power walked into the arena and stopped in the middle.* (So, Holly. I'm curious, what's with this fight-?)

Holland: "Doesn't matter-" *He spoke in an abrupt-like manner, causing PKMY to raise an eyebrow in confusion.*

Madora: "Choose your scenery!"

Holland: *He stared at PKMY and smirked in a loving manner.* (I'd usually say ladies first-)

PKMY: (He's temporarily blocked out my ability to read him..)

Holland: *He kept a fixated stare on PKMY, ignoring the blurred and swirling arena around him.* (But you would probably knock me out-)

PKMY: *She found herself in a quiet grassy meadow, listening to the faint sounds of waves in the distance.* "This is where we-.." *She observed the area with blushing cheeks.*

Madora: "Holland versus. PKMY, let the battle begin!"

Chapter 15: Holland Versus. PKMY

PKMY: "So, wat are we going to do, Holly?"

Holland: "Ougi-"

PKMY: "Ougi."

Holland: "Ancioldrant Freya." *Freya pounced out of a purple glyph which flashed in front of him.*

PKMY: "Incantation Exploitation." *She stuck her finger in her mouth and bit on it, causing a small stream of blood to run down her hand.*

Freya: *Her body grew in size and she gargled liquid-like fire.* (Holland, why did you want to fight her?)

PKMY: "Yea, Holly?"

Holland: "Because."

Madora: *She noticed several nearby villagers becoming frustrated.* "I said, the match has begun!-"

PKMY: *She ran towards Freya with her arms swaying behind her back.* "ICICLE EDGE"

Freya: *She stood on her hind legs and pointed her front paws at PKMY.* (Tangrowth Slash.)

*Vine-like nails shot out of Freya's paws and pierced through the air, screeching directly towards PKMY.*

PKMY: "Tssk-" *She sidestepped and waved her hand down, causing an ice spear to pierce downwards.*

Karol: *He watched PKMY stand in the middle of the vine-like claws in amazement.* (She has such confidence.)

Freya: "Grr-" *She swayed her paws, causing her nails to move in a scissor-like manner across PKMY.*

PKMY: *She quickly jumped high into the air.* "HEAT LANCE"

Holland: *He looked up in shock.* (Freya, above!)

Freya: *Her ear twitched and her nails instantly detached to the ground, causing another set to grow.* (Flash Hound.)

*Freya flashstepped just as the ice spear stabbed into the ground which exploded into an eruption of ice.*

Karol: (That was close.)

Ginger: (That Icicle Edge was boosted to its maximum capacity.)

PKMY: (I forgot she can flashstep-) *She landed on the ground with ease and backflipped across the field, facing vacant space.*

Lezard: "What's she doing?"

PKMY: (I've experienced many battles to know where the most common place to flashstep-) *She pushed forward and thirty lances made of flames arched out of her hand.*

Karol: "Whow, it's like a swarm of fire!"

Freya: *She flashstepped and her eyes reflected red, as PKMY's flames burnt through the air towards her.* (How did she-?!)

Lezard: "Holy fish-cakes-" *He spoke in amazement, leaning forward with anticipation.*

Freya: "Gruff-" *She pounced to each side, listening to the flames scorch past her.*

Holland: "Keep at it, Freya!" *He shouted in a worried manner, watching the flames extinguish in the far distance behind Freya.*

Freya: (Flash Hound.) *She quickly flashstepped in the air, looking down to the fire lances.*

PKMY: "Heh-" *She looked down, smirking at Freya's back.*

Karol: "H-How-?"

Nathan: "She has a good sense at where the opponent will flashstep-"

Karol: "I don't get it, Nafan?"

Lezard: "Our delightful PKMY flashstepped moments after Freya flashstepped."

Karol: *He slightly pouted in frustration, looking back to the arena.* (I'm closely watching the match but I'm still having trouble keeping up-)

PKMY: "Emperor's Fury." *She punched downwards, causing an aura-shaped fist to smash into Freya's back.*

Freya: "Gerooh!-" *She howled in pain, causing Holland to buckle at the knees.*

Holland: (My back!-)

PKMY: "Hah!" *She pushed forward, blasting Freya into the fire lances' explosions.*

Rachael: (PKMY purposely punched her towards the fire-)

Holland: "Hi-Ougi!"

*Freya suddenly disintegrated, barely avoiding the explosions of flames.*

PKMY: "Huh-?" *She spiralled in the air and landed on the ground with ease, looking at Holland in shock.*

Holland: "Winds howl and swirl with your might, flashes come before me and slice, sound waves erupt the ground and explode, follow by your epic down-ward waves of fire-"

PKMY: (A Hi-Ougi-) "Holly-?!"

*Destiny materialised behind Holland and flapped her wings, causing a tornado to swirl around PKMY.*

PKMY: *She crossed her arms in a defensive manner, watching the grass sway around her.* "Tssk-"

*Fryfry materialised around PKMY and sliced her with their speed and light.*

PKMY: (Shit! They felt like little heated needles!-)

*Twotters materialised in the air and fired off a swirl of violin-like sounds, bursting the ground under PKMY.*

PKMY: "Tssk-" *Shards of rock sliced past her face, causing her to close one eye in pain.*

Freya: *She re-materialised above the tornado.* "Gruff-"

PKMY: *She looked up, gasping with widening eyes.* "Shit-"

Freya: "Growlith!" *Wings of flames erupted from her back and she flapped downwards, causing a firestorm to scorch PKMY's arms.*

Holland: *He ran through the tornado, ignoring the flames and floating pieces of rock.* "SUMMONCE COMBO"

PKMY: "W-Wat-?" *She slid back and suddenly floated in the air, caused by Destiny's wind.* (Shit, I lost my grounding!-)

Holland: *He punched directly into PKMY's chest, causing a loud echoing howl to be heard.* "Grrr-"

PKMY: "H-Hawli-?" *She wheezed under her breath in shock as if she wasn't expecting Holland to punch her.*

Holland: "Herryarh!" *He pushed his fist forward with a frown, blasting PKMY out of the tornado and across the ground.*

Cameron: (He used his Hi-Ougi to get Freya out of harm's way, and at the same time, keeping PKMY on edge with an offensive-like nature.)

Apollo: (That is good thinking.)

Cameron: (Precisely my thoughts-) *He stood up and looked at the party, catching Blake's attention.*

Blake: "Where ya going, babe?"

Mio: (Don't call him that in public-)

Blake: (Shut up!)

Mio: (Bothersome.)

Cameron: "I will be back shortly. Please excuse me." *He turned around and shuffled down the row, causing Blake to smirk.*

PKMY: *She tumbled across the grass before coming to a stop.* "Grr-"

Holland: *Twotters, Destiny and Fryfry disintegrated into nothing.* "Phew-"

PKMY: *She groaned in frustration and kicked the ground, jumping back onto her feet.* (Ouch-) *She held her chest in pain, glaring at Holland in anger.* "That hurt."

Holland: *His eye twitched as if he regretted hurting PKMY.* "Go, Freya."

Freya: *She flashstepped in front of Holland and faced PKMY.* (I don't want to hurt her-)

Holland: "Don't say that, I'll change my mind-" *He grunted.* (I have to do this.)

PKMY: *She raised one arm and the area became pitch black.* "O' fiery spirits feel my power and awaken-"

*Massive red glyphs lit up the area, causing the crowd to awe in amazement.*

Ginger: "M-Meteor Swarm?!"

Luna: "Aye?"

Ginger: "One of the four lost Remenistal."

Lezard: "Ooo, sounds exciting?" *He giggled in a sarcastic manner, looking at Ginger.*

Ginger: "The four strongest Remenistal, one of each of the basic elements."

Rachael: "What are they?"

Ginger: "As I have already stated to you, you wield the strongest ground-based Remenistal-"

Nathan: "Desert Dragon."

Ginger: *She nodded her head.* "Next is Florian Driver."

Karol: (Wind-)

Ginger: "And lastly, Tsunami's Implosion."

Rachael: (That's a technique Season knows-)

Nathan: "What makes them so lost? I've seen three of them-?"

PKMY: "Sacrificial glyphs form and spiral, open the gates to The Astral plains-"

Nathan: *He looked back to the arena.* "Actually, about to see all of them."

Ginger: "They were deemed too dangerous and their incantations were purposely lost."

Nathan: (They were feared. Similar to the back story of Dragon's Roar.)

Rachael: "Either way, let's continue enjoying this match."

Lezard: "Right."

Holland: *He ignored the red spiralling glyphs, intensely staring at PKMY with a frown.* "I have to do this!"

Freya: (Why?)

Holland: "I have to beat her."

Freya: (To show your masculinity?! Dominance?!) *She thought with a disgusted tone, causing Holland to shake his head.*

Holland: "To prove, I'm the one that can protect her! To show her I'm stronger than her!" *He shouted with determination.* "By showing that, I can protect her!-"

Freya: "..."

Holland: "To show her, she can feel safe with me around!" *He yelled with emotion, causing hundreds of golden strings to become visible.*

Freya: *She glanced at the strings which connected her to Holland.* (Okay-)

PKMY: *She danced on the red glyph as large crimson glyphic rings formed in the air.* "Show me, prove to me that the legends are true, dark flames cover the skies, rain down and bring forth your total destruction-" *She paused and hesitantly stared at Holland as if she didn't want to use her Grand Rostical.* "METEOR-"

Holland: "Hi-Ougi."

PKMY: *She paused with confusion.* "You already used-?"

Freya: *Her body glowed and shined as if her fur was made of foil.* (The words-)

Holland: (When you're ready.)

Freya: (Ready!)

Holland: "Swirling shockwaves of flames and aqua-"

*Freya jumped high into the air above PKMY and shattered several glyphs like glass, causing several members of the audience to look up.*

PKMY: "-SWARM" *She lowered her arms and nothing happened.* "What?"

Nathan: *He chuckled and glanced at Ginger.* "Some lost forbidden thing."

Luna: "Aha, I reckon, it did nothin', aye."

Ginger: (The Scoldrant jumped through the glyphic rings and disrupted the Remenistal from activating..) "Each one has a weakness."

Lezard: "Please respond?"

Ginger: "Yohoho." *She chuckled, nodding her head.* "It is only logical."

Blake: "Rite, how does logic play a part in this?"

Ginger: "By the logic of, you are only as strong as your greatest weakness."

Blake: "Pfft." *He slowly focused his attention back on Freya, suddenly hissing in disbelief.*

Freya: *She curled up into a ball and spun around roaring out visible shockwaves, vortex's of water and swirls of flames.* "Groawrr."

Blake: (That level! Their Soul Link bond!-)

PKMY: *She looked up with a dumbfounded expression on her face.* "Tssk-" *She quickly ran over a string of flames and ducked under a pulse of water.*

*PKMY cartwheeled around a wave of visible sound and flashstepped out of a flurry of fire.*

PKMY: *She frowned at Holland, trying to sprint towards him.* "Tssk-" *She quickly flashstepped, avoiding a vortex of high pressured water.*

Karol: (Whow, she moves so elegantly, she would probably make a great dancer!-)

Holland: "Tangrowth of icy fangs entangle the opponent in our jungle-"

PKMY: *She flashstepped into the distance and panted, holding her chest in pain.* (I can't get close to Holly to knock him out of the Hi-Ougi-)

Freya: *She landed on the ground and dug all fours into the grass.* "Growoo." *She raised her head and howled, as hundreds of blue fluoro vine-like nails erupted out of the ground.*

PKMY: *She looked up in shock and stepped back, watching the fluoro nail-like streams blast towards her.* "Where is Freya getting these new moves from-?!"

Blake: (What level is this?!)

Mio: (A level we should possess..)

Blake: (Their breathing has even synchronised!-)

PKMY: (I need to get close-) *She jumped forward and one of the vine-like nails brushed past her hand, causing her skin to freeze.*

Luna: (Wow.)

Destiny: (That's amazing, yeup yeup!) *Her words echoed in Luna's mind.*

Luna: *She nodded her head in agreement.* (Yea!)

PKMY: *She gracefully avoided all the vine-like streams of nails, trying to hide her obvious exhaustion.* (That punch really affected me-)

Holland: "Flash-strike with all your might, now I lend you my power, release the hidden genes-"

Freya: *She flashstepped in the air in front of PKMY.* "Grarh." *She bit into PKMY's arm and flashstepped before she could respond.*

PKMY: "Argh-?!" *She shouted in anger, watching blood pour out from deep toothmarks in her skin.*

Freya: *She reappeared in the air behind PKMY, slashing her across the back.* "Growlith."

PKMY: "Argh-" *She spun around and hit Freya across the head.* "Wha-?" *Her hand went straight through her head as Freya's image appeared on the ground.*

Nathan: (What?! It took me years to master each step, focus on Neuron usage and Astragon control which led me to my flashstepping speeds, but now a Scoldrant can do it?!)

Freya: "Grrarh." *She violently bit into PKMY's ankle, causing her to collapse on one side.*

PKMY: "Grr-" *She gritted her teeth and quickly kicked her leg, sweeping under Freya's feet.*

Freya: *She flashstepped in front of Holland, causing a wave of grass to blow in PKMY's face.* "Uw-uw-uwoooh."

PKMY: (Dammit!)

Holland: "I call forth the strongest bonds of a Guardian! FREYA'S FRENZY"

Freya: *She flashstepped high into the air and spun around at blinding speeds.* (Frenzy!) *Swirls of fire, water, sound pulsed around her.*

Rachael: *She watched the elements hover around Freya in amazement.* (She's able to hold the projectiles, similar to Luna-)

Holland: "Now strike!"

Freya: *She stopped spinning as fluoro blue nails shot out around her.* "Grarh!" *She looked at PKMY and flapped her wings, blasting everything towards her.*

PKMY: *She looked up and stared at the combination of attacks, shaking her head in a defeated manner.* (Holly-)

*The fire, water, sound and nails collided on top of PKMY, causing an explosion to crack and distort the ground around her.*

Holland: "H-Harh-" *He stepped forward and held his throat in a sickly manner, watching Freya instantly disintegrate away.*

Karol: *He watched the light return to normal, focusing his attention to the dirt clouds around PKMY.* "What an awesome Hi-Ougi."

Luna: "True, but compared to yours, it's nothing."

Blake: "Yeah, which one?"

Luna: "Aha." *A purple flash came from behind her head, revealing Destiny floating above her.*

Karol: "Ah, shucks."

Destiny: "Yeup!" *She meowed and floated down, purposely sitting on Luna's lap.*

PKMY: "A-Ah-" *She moaned inside the dirt cloud, causing the crowd to become quiet.*

Holland: (That was my all, Amy.. If you can still stand, I'm done-)

*The dirt clouds blew away in the breeze and revealed PKMY, lying on the ground motionless.*

Blake: (Wow, he beat her?)

Madora: "It appears PKMY is unable to battle, Holland and Freya wins!" *She watched the field blur and warp, reverting back into the arena's original condition.*

Holland: *He deeply inhaled the restoring breeze, allowing him to run towards PKMY in a worried manner.* "Amy, Amy?"

PKMY: *A cool breeze restored her stamina.* "Holly?"

Holland: *He bent down on one knee and picked her up into his arms.* "I'm really sorry." *He stood up, watching PKMY's legs dangle over his arm.*

PKMY: *She rubbed her eyes and frowned, punching Holland on the chest.* "Why did you do that?"

Holland: "You should know why." *He smirked.*

PKMY: (His thoughts and emotions, I can hear and feel them now-) *She stared at Holland as if she was reading a book.*

Holland: "Well?"

PKMY: *She half smirked and looked away.* "Yea, but I want to hear you say it."

Holland: "Well-"

Madora: *She watched Holland carry PKMY out of the arena.* "Next is-"

Teresa: *Her image appeared in the middle of the arena, causing swirls of dirt to blow around her.* "Humph."

Cameron: *He proudly walked into the arena and stood in the middle, facing Teresa with an emotionless face.* "Hello."

Teresa: "Pointless talk-"

Cameron: "Is irrelevant in this type of scenario?"

Teresa: "Hoh? Precisely."

Madora: "Choose your scenery!"

Cameron: "Another rematch."

Teresa: "It appears so."

*Teresa and Cameron smiled at each other in a sense of respect, ignoring the changing area around them.*

Rachael: (Those two, they're so much alike-) *She watched the area warp into a running river.*

Cameron: *Water splashed around his feet as he stood on the river's surface.* "I could not think of an appropriate destination to engage in combat with."

Teresa: "Nevertheless, the environment or scenery is not entirely necessary."

Cameron: "Although, depending on one's abilities, it-"

Teresa: "May alter the victor."

Cameron: "Indeed."

Madora: "Teresa versus. Cameron!-"

Chapter 16: Teresa Versus. Cameron

Madora: "Let the battle begin!"

Teresa: *She reached behind her back and stepped forward.* "My Rostical roster has increased vastly since I last encountered you."

Cameron: *He leant forward, reaching behind his back.* "So has my self-awareness." *Sparks scattered around his arm and blue sword.*

Teresa: *She pointed the Pentarang at Cameron, watching sparks swirl around it.* "Self-awareness?"

Cameron: "I am no longer limited to the Consultant's instructions."

Teresa: "Please keep in due consideration, I am no longer limiting myself in that manner too."

Cameron: "Oh?"

Teresa: "I was suppressing my Neurons to an overwhelming point, to keep my signature below the Consultant's radars."

Cameron: "I have noticed one thing, and would like to confront you with a question."

Teresa: "Hoh?"

Madora: *She noticed several impatient grunts throughout the spectator seats.* "The match has begun."

Teresa: "Surely with our calibre, we could multi-task?"

Cameron: "Humph." *He chuckled.* "My thoughts exactly-" *He flashstepped, causing a pulse of water to explode where he stood.*

Teresa: "So-" *Her image disappeared, causing a pulse-like wave to ripple where she stood.*

Luna: (So, these are the number one captains..)

Destiny: (We've only encountered The Black Brigade, Vanguard, and Niklauseh, all of which were in the top three.)

Luna: *She nodded her head.* (I'll be damned if Vanguard wasn't an effin' number one! That battle on top of The Elemental Tower was one of our worst, aye.)

Destiny: (It was terrifying!)

Luna: (I don't think that Klaus guy was a warrior, but goin' by wat Ginger says, he's probably number one in power, too.)

Destiny: (We'll find out by watching this fight.) "Yeup!"

Teresa: *She stepped forward as the water flowed in slow motion.* (His base speed has definitely increased-)

Karol: "Where are they?"

Blake: *He stared at the river with heightened vision.* "They're still there, hey."

Karol: "In a flashstep stayte?"

Blake: "Yea."

Teresa: *She flashstepped several feet away from where she was and spun around, slicing the Pentarang across the air.* "So, what is this question?"

Cameron: *He flashstepped in the line of Teresa's swing.* "The question is in regards to the manner in which we speak-" *He blocked Teresa's swing, causing blue sparks to splinter past his face.*

Rachael: *She watched water erupt behind Cameron in amazement.* "The sheer level of Teresa's swing is causing the water to explode behind him.."

Lezard: "Devishly frightening."

Teresa: "And about such trivial things, what of it-?" *She quickly stepped to each side as Cameron's sword screeched past her head.*

Cameron: "Is it a number one trait?" *He jumped towards Teresa while slicing the sword at blinding speeds.*

Teresa: "Negative."

Cameron: *Another image of Teresa appeared behind him.* "Your ability is undoubtedly one of the best I have encountered-" *He spun around and sliced the air in a tornado-like fashion.*

*Rings of sparks scattered around Cameron as they flashed off each Pentarang.*

Apollo: (Awesome work! We will not be fooled by her ability again!)

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She frowned and lunged forward, jabbing the Pentarang towards Cameron's face.*

Cameron: "Humph-" *He quickly flicked the sword up and blocked Teresa's jab.* "AQUA LIQUID" *He swayed behind him, blasting the Teresa back with a high pressured wave.*

Blake: *He watched a wave of water push Teresa down the river before her image faded to nothing.* (Nicely done, Cam-)

Teresa: *She frowned, struggling to push Cameron's sword back.* "You have become remarkably strong-"

Cameron: *He flashstepped behind Teresa and slashed the sword across the back of her head.* "Negative, I was always this strong-"

Teresa: *She spun around, slicing across his face.* "Humph-"

*A loud metallic clash echoed in between their weapons, causing silence to fill the crowd.*

Teresa: *She grunted in struggle, watching a violent pulse of water blast around them.* (An evenly matched attack-)

Apollo: (Cameron, her Neurons increased and the Astragons slightly distorted around her! You know what that means!)

Cameron: (Indeed-)

Teresa: *Another copy stepped on the water behind Cameron, instantly slashing the Pentarang across the back of his neck.* "Hermph!-"

Cameron: *He flashstepped into the air, spraying water on Teresa's legs.* (I barely avoided that!-)

Teresa: *She looked up to Cameron and noticed strands of her hair waft past her with widening eyes.* "My hair-?"

Apollo: (You did it!)

Cameron: (We did it!-) *He looked down, staring at two copies of Teresa.*

Teresa: *She held several strands of her hair, looking up to Cameron in frustration.* (Perhaps I was expecting similar results from our previous fight.. I was not expecting this-)

Cameron: "ICICLE EDGE" *He swayed down and blasted a thick single ice spear at incredible speeds.*

Teresa: "Ho-?" *She looked up and gagged as the ice spear pierced right through her head.*

Karol: *He watched the water around Teresa instantly freeze, causing him to squeal in amazement.* "H-Holy Neurons!-"

Teresa: "Kah-" *She dropped the Pentarang which shattered the ice and sunk into the water.*

Teresa: *She watched her other image disappear as the ice around her shattered away.* "Tcch-"

Cameron: *He smirked, looking back to the unharmed image of Teresa.* "What is the matter?"

Teresa: *She touched her cheek and shattered ice off her skin.* "Nothing."

Cameron: "You say I have become remarkably strong-?" *He flashstepped in front of Teresa, slicing the sword across Teresa's face at blinding speeds.*

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She quickly swayed her arms upwards, hitting Cameron's sword with her Pentarang.*

Cameron: "Displeased that your face was struck?" *He stumbled back, half smirking at Teresa.* "Since when did you care over such trivial things-?"

Teresa: "I do not care-" *A thin cut appeared above her nose, just under her eyes.* "Tcch-"

Nathan: "This is a little intense."

Karol: "Y-Yheah."

Cameron: *He quickly lunged forward, violently stabbing the sword into Teresa's chest.* "Harh!"

Blake: "Yea bitches, he got her!"

Luna: "Not quite, aye-" *She carefully inspected the area through Destiny's heightened vision.*

Teresa: "..." *Her image faded, causing Cameron to lunge a step forward in shock.*

Cameron: "Illusion?!"

Teresa: "Harh." *She appeared above Cameron and sliced downwards.*

Cameron: *He awkwardly looked up before fixing his body posture.* "Hmph." *He leapt forward, giving the illusion he flew above the water.*

Teresa: "He avoided-" *A large cut formed on the water before exploding.* (He knew blocking the attack would have been pointless. So he dodged instead-)

Cameron: (All these copies, it is not an illusion, it is her ability!) *He grunted, triggering a flashback.*

--

Cameron: *He looked to his side, watching Teresa land on the damp ground.* "There have only been two survivors to withstand my Ougi."

Teresa: *She watched blood run down her arm in shock, facing Cameron.* "Hoh?"

Cameron: *He stepped to the side, swaying his sword behind his back.* "Can you really-?"

*The sword suddenly extended, piercing through the forest towards Teresa.*

Teresa: "Inconceivable!-" *She pushed herself back, watching the blue sword stab into the ground.*

Cameron: "Count yourself as the third person?"

Teresa: *She stumbled back, staring at the sword.* (He can extend his sword's length? But at what speed and distance? Once I find out, it will be easy to-)

Cameron: *He flicked his wrist, causing another sword to shoot out from the sword.* "My technique may be simple, but it is also complex-"

Teresa: *She gasped with widening eyes, as the other sword sliced past her arm, stabbing into a nearby tree.* (Another sword somehow materialised from the body of his already extended sword-)

Cameron: "I will not allow you to analyse my techniques!" *He raised his arm, causing a sword to erupt from the ground, stabbing Teresa through the chest.*

Teresa: "Karh-?" *She looked down and stared at the sword poking through her chest.*

Cameron: "I was asked to bring you back, they did not say you were needed to be in top condition."

Teresa: "Hermph-" *Her image disappeared, causing the sword to drop to the ground.*

Cameron: "What?!"

Teresa: *Her image appeared on top of a branch, looking down at Cameron.* "Using the environment to your advantage-"

Cameron: *He quickly turned around, as the sword reverted back to its original state.* "How-?!"

Teresa: "Typhoon's Pulse." *She pointed her finger at Cameron and jabbed forward, exploding the ground around him.*

--

Teresa: *She stood on the air, staring down at Cameron with an emotionless face.* "..."

Cameron: *He raised the sword to his face and faced Teresa, instantly slicing the air in front of him.* "Air Slash."

Nathan: (Learning skills from both Ordin and Cameron has made me so much stronger-)

Cameron: *He watched the air slash slice through the air towards Teresa.* (I wonder how she will dodge this?)

Teresa: *She dived down and landed on the water with one foot, raising her hand.* "What did you hope to-?"

Cameron: *He flashstepped behind Teresa, slicing a visible air slash directly behind her.* "Air Slash."

Teresa: *She gasped and quickly spun around at amazing speeds, staring at the air slash with widening eyes.* "Tcch-"

*Teresa slapped the air slash to her side, causing an eruption of water to explode just behind her.*

Cameron: (She knocked it past her with no effort.)

Teresa: "Typhoon's Pulse." *She poked her finger at Cameron.*

Cameron: "Air Slash." *He shouted, slicing another visible air slash towards Teresa.*

*A massive wind pulse-like explosion, erupted the water in between Cameron and Teresa high into the air.*

Teresa: *She slid back and glanced at the Pentarang, causing her to unintentionally smile.* "..." *She swiftly raised the Pentarang behind her and watched the water rain down, staring at Cameron.*

Cameron: *He watched the water rain on the river's surface before staring at Teresa with an emotionless face.* "Do you remember? This is where we engaged in combat."

Teresa: "..."

Cameron: *He glanced to his side, noticing the tall trees in the distance.* "They are just like how I remember-"

*A flash of light pierced the air and slashed Cameron across the cheek, causing a trail-like swirl of water to blast past him.*

Cameron: (Her weapon?! She can throw it!)

Apollo: (When I think about it, she did not release her weapon before!)

Teresa: *She stood forward in an arched-like manner as if she threw something.* "Humph." *She stood up straight and smirked as her image disappeared.*

Cameron: *He touched his cheek in shock and observed the blood on his hand.* (I do not recall her using that weapon either. So it appears it may be long-ranged too-)

*Cameron quickly leant on the side, dodging Teresa's flashstepping punch.*

Teresa: *She stepped forward on one foot and kicked to the side, watching her foot touch Cameron's neck.* "...-"

Cameron: "GLACIA'S EDGE" *A thick pillar of ice shot up from the water, blocking Teresa's kick.*

Teresa: *She watched the ice shatter and fall into the water, causing her to step back in a cautious manner.* "..."

Apollo: (Cameron! When did you learn Glacia's Edge?!)

Cameron: *He ignored Apollo and raised the sword, staring at Teresa in a serious manner.* "I respect your abilities and attributes, but do not ever confront me without a weapon-"

Teresa: "Hoh? Ougi."

Cameron: *He gasped and lost his composure, causing his foot to sink into the water.* (That Ougi!-)

--

Teresa: "Ougi." *She spoke with an emotionless face, sending shivers up Cameron's spine.*

-

Teresa: *She stepped through swirls of multi-coloured flames, walking across an ash-covered ground towards Cameron.* (Using my Ougi has weakened me so-)

Cameron: *He lay on his back, watching balls of flames burn on top of the river.* "Hu-"

Teresa: "Do not even try."

Cameron: *He appeared sick and looked pale.* (This woman?)

--

Cameron: *He frowned in recollection and quickly dropped to the water, sweeping under Teresa's feet.* "Harh!"

Teresa: *Cameron knocked her off her feet.* "Tcch-"

Cameron: *He glanced at Teresa and vibrated his body, watching her fall towards the water in slow motion.* "I know you can somehow flashstep in mid-air-"

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She frowned with gritted teeth.*

Cameron: "But-" *He stood up and lunged the sword towards Teresa's face.*

Blake: *He giggled in excitement.* (Yes, he won!)

Cameron: "Even you can not react to this in time-"

*A flash of light spiralled through the air and blue sparks suddenly scattered in front of Teresa's face.*

Nathan: "Huh?"

Cameron: *He glanced down and noticed his sword jabbed into the water.* (My sword was deflected?! I had clearly aimed it towards her head-?!)

Teresa: "Humph-" *She smirked with relief and her image disappeared before she touched the water.*

Cameron: "How was my sword deflected? She did not wield her weapon to do so?" *He quickly mumbled in thought, raising the sword out of the water.*

Apollo: (It was her weapon, Cameron! Sqcork.)

Nathan: *Images of the Pentarang flashed in his mind.* (Such a unique weapon, and toppled with such a powerful ability, she's certainly a powerhouse.)

Cameron: (Her weapon?)

Apollo: (To the side!)

Cameron: *He looked to the side, noticing a flash of light spiral away in the air.* (I see..)

Teresa: *She flashstepped into the distance, catching her Pentarang in mid-air.* "Hmph-"

Apollo: *He blasted out of a spiralling glyph in front of Cameron, flying directly towards Teresa.* "CYCLONIC WINDS"

Blake: (Apollo!)

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She frowned and faced Apollo, enthusiastically pushing forward.* "CATAGORY NINE"

Ginger: (Catagory Nine.. Its power once rivalled a category nine storm, the storm annihilated villages-)

Apollo: *He enthusiastically flapped his wings, watching a wall of water explode high into the air.* (Her wind matches mine in Neuronic power!)

Cameron: (No need-) *He jumped forward and slid across the water's surface one foot at a time, giving the illusion he was ice skating.*

Teresa: *Her hair violently flapped backwards.* (Tcch-)

Cameron: *He slid around the water and noticed Teresa, cueing him to raise his sword.* "Air Slash."

*Cameron sliced a visible air slash towards Teresa, watching the water ripple underneath it.*

Teresa: (I have to do this?) *Her image suddenly disappeared, causing the water generated by the two winds to suddenly crash on top of where she stood.*

Cameron: *He watched his Air Slash slice into the crashing water, causing another eruption of water to explode.* (How troublesome.)

Apollo: (I felt no residence in my wind-?)

Teresa: *She appeared above Apollo, raising a leg to her face.* "Long-range Lotus." *She kicked downwards, causing a fluoro blue wave to slam into Apollo's back.*

Apollo: "Squar!-" *He screeched and plummeted into the water, instantly disintegrating into a pulse of white orbs.*

Lezard: (Teresa, for that splitting moment, released all her Neurons to avoid that situation Cameron and Apollo placed her in.)

Cameron: *He watched feathers sway down in a line from Teresa's foot, causing him to frown in anger.* (My lower back.. It hurts!) "Flame Stroke."

*Cameron lined the sword up with Teresa and sliced to the side, causing a slash-like string of flames to cut Teresa's arm.*

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She flashstepped back onto the water and faced Cameron, ignoring the pulse of water around her.*

Cameron: *He stared at the slash-like burn mark on Teresa's arm.* (Are you at optimum levels?)

Apollo: (I am okay.)

Teresa: "Cameron. Surely you have not forgotten what I said?"

Cameron: "Hmm?"

Teresa: *She cupped one hand in front of her face, causing the water to float in the air around her.* "Bakana Flare." *She pointed at Cameron and suddenly a multi-coloured flare of flames erupted towards him.*

Cameron: *His eyes widened as he helplessly stared at the flames.* (It is too wide to flashstep away!-) *Red and green flames stringed past him, as the wave of fire flared in front of him.*

Teresa: "A direct hit." *She mumbled with confidence, watching the water instantly steam to the fire's presence.*

Apollo: (If you can not move out of the way, then block it!)

Cameron: *He frowned and braced himself, as the wave of flames crashed in front of him.* (Argh!-)

Nathan: *He watched the multi-coloured flames push Cameron across the water at a fast speed.* "How is the fire not consuming him?"

Blake: "He's using the Astragons as a repellent." *He sounded distracted as he stared at Cameron in a worried manner.*

Cameron: (Blast it-) *He held the sword across his body, placing one hand behind it for support.*

Nathan: "This doesn't look good! He was hit directly by her Ougi."

Rachael: (I haven't been able to gauge Cameron's power, so I'm not sure how well he'd do against an attack like that-) *She watched the flames distort the river's current, causing the water to glisten.*

Karol: "The water is sparkling different colours."

Ginger: "It is logical, the flames are of different colours, so the water will reflect it as such, please respond."

Lezard: "Don't be so spicy, just enjoy it."

Rachael: "Lezard."

Luna: "Nah, I'm on his side."

Lezard: "Holy fish-cakes, you are, Loonzamotto? I mean, yippee!"

Rachael: "Luna?"

Luna: "Sometimes, you don't need to know how it works, you just have to appreciate what's lyin' right in front of you."

Destiny: "Yeup!"

Cameron: *His hand started to sizzle as the sword started to glow orange.* (This sword can not break, but my hand can-) *His feet violently shook, as the water rushed above his ankles.*

Teresa: (To my knowledge, he does not have an affinity towards fire, thus, he can not tank my Ougi-)

Cameron: *He frowned, opening his mouth in desperation.* "I am number one!"

Nathan: *He gasped in shock, watching the flames splinter past Cameron.* (He still has that amount of Neurons?!)

Cameron: *He quickly leant forward and bent at the knees, causing the wave of flames to stop.* "Harh!" *He yelled at the top of his lungs and swayed his entire body.*

Teresa: (Are my eyes deceiving me, or has my fire temporarily stopped?)

Cameron: *He sliced the sword to his side, causing the flames to burn past him.* "Powerful-" *He took a deep breath and stared in front at a trail of steam which sizzled above the river's surface.*

Lezard: "Oh my."
Karol: "Holy Neurons."

Blake: "Fufufu, that's Cam for ya." *He smiled proudly.*

Teresa: *She noticed several fish float above the water, caused by the fire.* "Tcch, impress-"

Cameron: *He flashstepped face to face to Teresa, raising the sword in a serious manner.* "Hi-Ougi."

Teresa: *She raised the Pentarang and pushed herself back, causing her to slide across the water away from Cameron.* (What a fool, for a moment I was vulnerable-)

Apollo: (I hear your thoughts loud and clear, my partner!)

Cameron and Apollo: "Dreaming Zodiac." *Their voices echoed out loud, causing several people in the audience to grunt in confusion.*

*Rachael, Luna, Lezard and Karol gasped at Cameron.*

Nathan: "That's Arcadia's Ougi, isn't it?!"

Luna: "Ah huh."

Teresa: "Dreaming Zodiac?" *She frowned in confusion as if she didn't know how it worked.*

Karol: (Dweaming Zodiack.. Arkaydia..)

Cameron and Apollo: "Prepare to be cleansed."

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She spread her legs and pointed both hands at Cameron.* "Sacred blood throughout my veins, I say heed thout command-"

Man: "When that guy in the warrior's armour speaks, there's another voice?"

Woman: *She looked to her side, shrugging her shoulders in confusion.* "Maybe it's the echo from the Rostical?"

Man: "Maybe, but they were different voices-?"

Teresa: "SOUTHERN CROSS"

Cameron: (Focus on the negative energy-) *He looked down and started to concentrate, as dark-blue crescent cuts sliced the air around him.*

Apollo: (Add just enough Astragons to manipulate the energy into physical form-)

Teresa: *She ignored Cameron and raised her arms.* "I know the true incantation now-" *Her eyes shined gold.* "Shattering bonds, my Radiatons explode and implode the power of light-"

Blake: *He covered his eyes, as clusters of blinding light shined around Cameron and Teresa.* (I can't see what's going on-)

Mio: (Use my vision!)

Blake: *His eyes changed into that of a dragon's, giving him altered vision.* (Thanks, bitch.)

Mio: (For the last time, I am not your bitch.)

Teresa: "SERENITY SWIRL"

*A blinding flash followed by saw-like metallic sounds screeched through the arena.*

Lezard: "Jinkies!" *He sarcastically wheezed, covering his eyes in disorientation.*

Blake: (Amazing..)

Rachael: *She squinted her eyes while covering Karol's.* "Luna or Blake, any idea what's going on?"

Luna: "It's just looked like they were cuttin' the air in front of them, aye."

*The blinding light faded and revealed Teresa and Cameron both hunching down in a tired-like state.*

Apollo: (She blocked our scratches and slashes.)

Teresa: *She breathed heavily through her mouth.* (Two incantation boosted light-based Rostical was only enough to block his Hi-Ougi!-)

Cameron: *He struggled to stand up straight and he pointed the sword at Teresa.* "Ready when you are."

Teresa: *She smiled and held the Pentarang to her side.* "Indeed-"

Cameron: *He flashstepped off the river and on the end of a branch in the distance.* "Over here-" *A pulse of wind blew around him, causing the branches to sway downwards.*

Teresa: "I am quite aware of your location-" *She looked down at Cameron.*

Cameron: *He slowly turned around in shock.* (I was looking at her image! She really is fast!)

Teresa: "Humph." *She flicked her hair over her shoulder and waited for Cameron to make his move.*

Cameron: *He smiled with respect and ran on his toes up the branches towards Teresa.* "Harh!" *He raised the sword with both hands and sliced downwards.*

Teresa: "Herh." *She hopped back on each branch on her toes, slicing the Pentarang across Cameron's sword.*

Karol: *He watched sparks scatter off their weapons with amazement.* (There's no way I could compete with those tooh.)

*Cameron and Teresa both flashstepped and appeared on the tip of the tallest tree.*

Lezard: *He scanned across the landscape.* "Where-?"

Nathan: "Over there?" *He pointed at the tree in amazement.*

*Teresa and Cameron shouted in the heat of battle as their weapons clashed together, causing sparks to temporarily light up their faces and armour.*

Cameron: "Your battle skills are seriously amazing."

Teresa: "I too recognise your fighting attributes." *Her hair flicked to the side followed by a line of blue sparks.*

Cameron: *He continued to slice the sword at Teresa at blinding speeds.* "I still have my Ougi, A Storm of Swords, also, my Grand Remenistal."

Teresa: "And I still have my mother's inspired Grand Rostical."

Cameron: "Then, if we both recognise our skills-"

Teresa: "Then the purpose of this fight has been decided?" *Blue sparks scattered past her face.*

Cameron: *The Pentarang jabbed past his head.* "My thoughts exactly."

*Teresa and Cameron lowered their weapons and they stepped back on separate branches.*

Teresa and Cameron: "I forfeit the battle." *They shouted at the same time.*

Luna: "Wut?"
Blake: "Wat?"
Nathan: "Ha." *He smirked as if he could understand their intentions.* (I get it.. The match was about respect-)

Lezard: "Oh jolly goodness, what?"

Rachael: "Oh why?"

Madora: "I-It appears Teresa and Cameron have forfeited the battle." *She ignored the boos which echoed from the audience.*

Ginger: "How illogical? Pick a match, go out all, then forfeit? The time to forfeit would be at the start of the match. Please respond?"

Madora: "It's a draw." *She shouted, watching the scenery revert back to normal.*

Cameron: *He nodded his head and turned away from Teresa, facing one of the gates.* "It was nice having closure."

Teresa: "Indeed."

Madora: *She watched them flashstep out of the arena, causing her to make her next announcement.* "Next is-"

Season: *He hobbled into the arena.* (If memory serves me right, this is my second last battle-)

Lance: *He ran into the arena and stopped in the middle.* "Hey hey."

Season: "Greetings."

Lance: "So, let's get started?"

Season: "Of course."

Madora: "Choose your scenery!"

Season: *He closed his eyes and the area blurred, causing the arena to become dark.* "I'm not fond of this environment either-"

Lance: *He looked up and noticed he was in a large cave.* "So why did ya pick somethin' like this then?" *He shook his head, grunting in disappointment.*

Season: *He glanced at numerous human-sized rock pillars which eroded out of the rocky ground.* "Well, I can say this with confidence-"

Lance: "And I say this with confidence.. Your voice reminds me of the fat guy dressed in red and white-"

Season: "..."

Lance: "Nah, jokes. Wat is it?"

Season: "This arena.. I can say for certain, that you're the strongest lightning-based user I've ever encountered."

Lance: "Ch'yeah." *He smirked and cockily sniffed, wiping his nose with one finger.*

Season: "And that is that."

Lance: "Despite the weird compliments, I just wanted to know why ya picked this feral cave, but, thanks?"

Season: (I'll let you figure it out-)

Madora: "Season versus. Lance-"

Chapter 17: Season Versus. Lance

Madora: "Let the battle begin!"

Lance: (Well, I hate waitin'-) *He grunted in preparation and stepped back, straightening his arm at Season.* "Smear upon the skies, blue waves crashing down-"

Rachael: (Straight into it, that's a Lighten for you, hehe.)

Lance: "LIGHTNING BLAST" *He pushed forward and blasted a stream of yellow lightning towards Season, effectively lighting up the cave.*

Season: *He quickly hobbled behind a rock pillar, watching bright flashes of light appear on the ground.* "Frostic stars, rain forth-"

Lance: *He watched the lightning string in front of the rock pillar before sparking away.* "Huh?" (The rock thingy resisted my lightning?)

Luna: "Rach, I've seen some types of rock explode in the presence of my lightning arrows, while others seem to take some time to do anythin', why's that?"

Lezard: "Fascinating question, Loonzamotto."

Luna: *She rolled her eyes, smirking in a playful manner.* "Wateva."

Rachael: "Think of them like my weapons, I find lapis lazuli better suited as daggers, crystals for gauntlets and diamond as shields."

Luna: "Yea?"

Rachael: "Each with different textures and attributes, it's pretty much the same for this."

Luna: "Sounds simple enough."

Lezard: "Ooo, where's the long explanation of how it works?"

Blake: "Sorry, Lizard wants a slap?" *He hissed with a twitching eye.*

Ginger: "Different stones are produced unalike of each other, for example, Rachael's lapis lazuli-based weapons are usually formed by contact of metamorphism of limestones which-"

Lezard: "Lezard's joking, jeez, everyone's so serious today." *He sarcastically wiggled his bottom, focusing his attention back to the arena.*

Ginger: "Ykkt-" *She looked displeased.* "Do not ask a question if you have no intention of knowing the answer, please respond?"

Lezard: "Understood!"

Lance: *He observed his surroundings and noticed the numerous rock pillars around him, causing him to grunt in realisation.* "The cave, I get it now-"

Season: "FRIGID STORM" *He jumped from behind the rock pillar and pointed at the ground below Lance.*

Lance: "Aye?" *He looked down and a blast of ice needles spiralled past him.* (That hurts!-)

Season: "Taste the power of crushing currents, devour the sacred waters-"

Lance: *He squinted his eyes in pain, staring at Season.* "Roar with the skies might-"

Season: "AQUA-"
Lance: "THUNDER BOOM" *He pushed forward and a rumbling thunder forced Season back onto a rock pillar.*

Season: "Oof-" *He grunted and staggered to the side, quickly stepping away from the rock pillar.*

Lance: "Smear upon the skies and envelop your might, thunder roar down, LIGHTNING PULSE" *He clapped his hands and a blue ring of lightning spiralled around his wrists.*

Season: (Hasn't he realised he can't use lightning here?) "Flames consume and burn my Astragons-"

Lance: "Harh!" *He pushed forward and the ring of lightning rumbled like thunder towards Season.*

Season: "...-" *He sighed with a smile, watching the lightning alter course.*

Lance: *He watched his lightning hit a nearby rock pillar.* "Huh-?!"

Season: "HEAT LANCE"

Lance: "Wait! Why did it do that?!"

Season: *He ignored Lance as his fire brightly lit up the massive cave.* "Take this!" *He pretended to throw a spear, hurling six fire lances towards Lance.*

Lance: (What the hell is goin' on!?) *He stepped back and raised his arm, watching the fire flare towards him.* "Vibrating molecules, heat, expand, repel, MAGNETIC RUMBLE"

*A white glyph expanded from Lance's arm and rumbled like thunder, blocking each fire lance.*

Season: *He watched the flames splinter past Lance, causing the cave to slowly dim back into darkness.* (I don't recall him having a powerful defensive Rostical-)

Lance: *He lowered his arm, causing the shield to disintegrate into nothing.* "..."

Season: (I'll use the environment around me-) *A brown glyph zigzagged under his feet.* (To boost the affinity's power of-)

*Red lightning stringed on Lance's sides, causing Season to stare at him in a wary manner.*

Lance: "Lightning strike both sides, flashing and flowing, call upon the secrets, summon the beast of roaring thunder-" *He hoped on one foot towards Season, ignoring the flashes of red lightning around him.*

Man: "That's the amazing Rostical he used back at Silver Wind Island!" *A man shouted, eagerly pointing at Lance in amazement.*

Rachael: *She listened to the crowd around her gasp in excitement.* (Hehe, Lance..)

Season: (Dragon's Breath, I better not risk this one-) *He quickly hobbled behind a rock pillar and casually rested his back on it, taking a deep breath.*

Lance: "DRAGON'S BREATH" *He jumped forward, punching the air in front of him.*

Rachael: (I wouldn't mind seeing how well my abilities handle against this Rostical-)

*Strings of red lightning lit up the entire cave as they made static-like sounds.*

Rachael: *She watched thick lightning consume the entire cave as it slowly flared towards Season.* (It's strong, thick and wide, but it's very slow. Similar to an uncontrolled Aubergine Blossom.)

Karol: "Yooh can actually hear the lightning!"

Ginger: "Ey, K-Karol? It is definitely mastered."

Season: *He looked to his side and watched small strings of lightning flash past the rock pillar, exploding the ground in front of him.* (Oh my-)

*Season looked slightly worried, unintentionally pressing himself harder against the pillar.*

Season: "No matter how strong, the density of these rocks should withstand any lightning!"

Lance: *He looked surprised, listening to Season's voice.* "Yea? We'll see!"

*The lightning took shape of a dragon and roared out thunder as it slithered past Season and down the cave.*

Karol: (Lightning, it always looks really sckary.) *He watched the lightning crack the cave's walls, causing him to twitch in fear.*

Season: "As predicted, I felt nothing except for some slight sparks that touched me!"

Lance: "Sparks?" *He grunted to himself with a frown.*

Season: "Why don't you give up?" *He tilted his head up, yelling out from behind the rock pillar.*

Lance: "There's a spark in no time, let your colours burst and shine, allow your existence to fade, NIGHTSHADE" *He straightened his arm and a stream of thick black lightning blasted towards the rock pillar.*

Season: "You really take a while to learn things-" *The rock pillar vibrated against his back and a stream of black lightning shot out of his chest.*

Lance: *Black lightning swirled around his hand.* "Yea I heard you. These rocks can take any lightning no matter how strong." *He spoke in a feral tone, pretending to be Season.*

Luna: "Sh-Shit-"

Blake: "Bitch, please!" *He hissed under his breath in amazement.*

Lance: "Looks like that wasn't lightning-" *He smirked to himself, shaking his wrist.*

Season: *He held his chest, stumbling into Lance's vision.* "I-I thought it was lightning-" *He spoke in pain, struggling to stand on his feet.*

Lance: "Nah, to be honest, I low-key don't actually know wat kind of element it is, aye-"

Season: "I never took you as a liar, Lance!"

Lance: "Pssht, I ain't no liar-" *He flashstepped in arm's length away from Season.* "Sorry, I gotta fight you seriously, you're really strong and I know that."

Season: *He looked at Lance in shock, causing him to step back.* "..."

Lance: "Roar with the skies might, THUNDER BOOM" *He pushed forward and a growl of thunder knocked Season back into the wall.*

Season: *He grunted and held his hands in front, causing glyphic purple rings to spiral in front.* "DIMENSION CR-"

Lance: "Ougi, Zero-volt Blender." *He pushed forward and a funnel of fog hit Season, causing streams of vein-like lightning to scatter along the wall.*

Season: "Argh!" *He closed his eyes in pain as wind blew in his face caused by the fog.*

Luna: *She smirked to herself, watching lightning string along Season's arms with magnified vision.* (Not bad, big stupid brother-)

Lance: *He lowered his arms, causing the fog to evaporate away.* "I've become pretty awesome hey?" *He smiled and watched Season drop to the ground.*

Madora: (I don't believe it-) "I-It appears Season is unable to battle, Lance wins!" *She watched the area revert back into the arena.*

Season: *A cool wind healed his wounds and removed the charcoal markings on his robes.* "You have-"

Lance: *He smirked and walked up to Season, helping him up with respect.* "Kool idea with the rock cave thingy by the way."

Season: "Hohoho, I'm glad you're no longer a sore winner."

Lance: *He rolled his eyes with a smirk.* "Wateva."

Madora: *She watched Lance and Season walk out of the arena.* "Next is-"

Pepper: *She walked into the arena with her head lowered, staring at the differently-shaped footprints in the dirt.* (After being told by Celest what happened with Alicia in Valhalla-)

*Pepper paused and stood in the middle of the arena, chuckling to herself in wonder.*

Alicia: *She walked into the arena and stopped in the middle, facing Pepper.* "H-Hello."

Pepper: "Aliciana."

Alicia: "N-No, please just call me Alicia."

Pepper: "I am very curious as to why you decided to challenge me?"

Alicia: "Well, Season said in the cabin during the feast, that the rules were lifted."

Pepper: "Hmm?"

Madora: "Choose your scenery!"

Alicia: "Well, I don't actually want to fight you."

Pepper: "You? Don't want to fight?"

Alicia: "N-No-"

Pepper: "Then why are you wasting my time-?"

Alicia: *The area blurred and became brighter than normal.* "We will still fight-"

Pepper: *She looked down and noticed clouds.* "I say-?" *She started to fall, causing radiant wings to erupt out from her back to keep her afloat.*

Alicia: *Large radiant wings burst out from her back.* "Everywhere in Valhalla, there were always references to how good you were. Even Sofia said you were better."

Karol: "Nee hee, whow, they're in the sky!"

Pepper: "You're assuming I know what you're talking about-?" *A blue ribbon materialised on each side of her waist, causing her to look down in surprise.*

Alicia: *Her hair swayed in the warm breeze as blue ribbons materialised on her waist.* "I think you know."

Pepper: *She smiled with nostalgia and looked at Alicia, as her eyes shined gold.* "I say, you did participate in the games?"

Alicia: *She closed her eyes with a smile and opened them, revealing bright golden eyes.* "Yes."

Blake: "What's happening?" *He hissed, raising an eyebrow in curiosity.*

Rachael: "I have no idea."

Lezard: "Oh my? Those ribbons.. This couldn't be-.."

Luna: "Couldn't be what?"

Ginger: "Ey, Lezard, please respond."

Lezard: "The Swarming Light Flight." *He smiled in recollection, quickly glancing at each party member.* "I'll explain everything as it goes along-"

Pepper: "I say, I am quite shocked, you've made a name of yourself."

Alicia: "Tee hee, it was fun."

Pepper: "What did you come?"

Alicia: "First."

Pepper: (First?!)

Madora: *She admired the sky and coughed.* "Pepper versus. Alicia-"

Chapter 18: Pepper Versus. Alicia

Madora: "Let the battle begin!"

Alicia: *She looked up and bathed in the sunlight.* "...-"

Pepper: "The match has begun."

Alicia: "Tee hee-" *She spun away from Pepper and blasted through the sky at incredible speeds.*

Pepper: *She watched Alicia fly away, noticing sparkles of light glitter from her wings.* (She may have come first, but if I was enrolled in the game too.)

Lezard: (Even Alicia has unlocked her radiant wings, am I the only one that hasn't grown as much as the others?)

Pepper: *She kicked herself into the air and slowly hovered in the breeze, observing Alicia's flight movements.* (To challenge me into this game, she must have confidence.)

Alicia: *She skimmed above a thin layer of cloud, aimlessly flying into one direction.* (I wonder if Pepper is as good as everyone says she is.)

Pepper: *Her wings moved like razor blades and she leant forward, focusing her attention on Alicia.* "Time to start thy guess-" *She shot herself through the air at blinding speeds.*

Rachael: "Her image blurred, did she flashstep in mid-air?"

Lezard: "It seems like everyone can do it now, oh golly."

Alicia: *She looked behind her and noticed a beam of light heading towards her.* (That light? Is she using Rostical-?)

Pepper: *Her ponytails rapidly flapped as she flew into striking distance.* (Those ribbons shall be mine-)

Alicia: (No! That light was!-. She's the quickest I've ever encountered-)

Pepper: *Her image appeared face to face with Alicia.* "..." *She smirked and looked down, reaching out to grab one of Alicia's ribbons.*

Alicia: "A-Arh-" *She looked shocked, quickly hitting Pepper's hand away.*

Pepper: "Hermph-" *She blasted forward and palmed Alicia on the chest, pushing her back with ease.*

Alicia: *Her hair and pendant flapped in front of her face.* (She's so powerful!-) *Her wings flared, causing her to instantly stop.*

Pepper: "Humph-" *She appeared behind Alicia, reaching for a ribbon.*

Alicia: "W-What-?! ICICLE EDGE" *She shouted in shock, causing a line of twenty ice spears to plummet behind her.*

Pepper: "I say-" *She quickly withdrew her arm and flew back, watching the ice spears slice down in front of her.*

Alicia: (I have to-) *She looked down and suddenly spiralled towards the land below, diving into several layers of cloud.*

Pepper: (She's fast-) "Humph-" *She kicked her leg upwards and pushed down, diving towards Alicia.*

Rachael: (It's amazing how these women can fly through the air like that.. I know I've seen a lot, but, sometimes I still compare things to Earth.)

Blake: "Oi?!"

Karol: "W-What's wrong, Blayke?"

Blake: "I just realised, they aren't fighting-"

Luna: "Yea, but when do you get to see something like this?" *She watched Alicia spiral through the clouds, closely followed by Pepper.*

Blake: *He watched Alicia dive out of the clouds, causing him to nod his head with a smirk.* "Fufufu, true."

Alicia: (I know she's right behind me-) *She looked to her side and noticed a dark coloured cloud, causing her to point at it.*

Pepper: *She squinted her eyes, flying through the clouds in a blind-like manner.* (Regarding experience, I have the upper hand.)

Alicia: "Kiss the rain, WATER STORM" *She waved her arm back and a waterfall-like current whooshed out of the cloud.*

Ginger: (Using the water in the cloud to boost her Remenistal!) *She thought in amazement.*

Pepper: *She dived out of the cloud and instantly noticed the incoming current with shock.* "SHINING RAIN"

*Pepper quickly raised her arm towards the water and several blades of light blasted from her hand.*

Ginger: *She watched the light shoot into the water, causing it to explode and burst.* "Impressive-"

Alicia: *She looked back and gasped.* (She stopped it? That was much faster than I thought-)

Pepper: *She stopped and stood on the air, watching Alicia fly off into the distance.* "Power of the forbidden spirits, come to my command, with seraphic powers, TELEPORTATION"

*A purple glyph drew itself on the air underneath Pepper, causing her hair to sway upwards.*

Alicia: *She tilted on her side, causing her to glide at an angle.* (I remember when I first met Pepper-) *She smiled and a sudden flash of purple light under her caught her attention.* "Huh-?"

Pepper: *She flew upwards snatching a blue ribbon from Alicia's right side.* "Hermph."

*Pepper smiled and looked at her fist, watching the ribbon flap in between her fingers.*

Pepper: (She's fast, but skilled? Hardly.) *She let go of the ribbon and watched it spiral away.* (Now, for the other-)

Alicia: (She already got one!) *She frowned and flew towards Pepper at a fast speed.*

Blake: "OK, so they gotta steal them ribbons, aye?"

Lezard: "Yuppers."

Karol: "So, Peppa is winning." *He looked at Lezard, watching him nod his head in response.*

Alicia: "Frosted skies reveal the truth, please with the power strike forward-" *She flew in front of Pepper and stopped, causing her clothes to rapidly flap to one side.*

Pepper: *She faced Alicia, smiling in a confident manner.* "You have an aspiring drive, confronting me like this-"

Alicia: *She took a deep breath and opened her hand, placing it in front of her mouth.* "FREEZING HOLLOWS" *She blew out a gust of mist which instantly froze Pepper.*

Ginger: *She watched the air sparkle in the mist cloud around Pepper.* (A near perfect execution in timing-)

Pepper: *Ice shards formed behind her due to the freezing gust.* (Cannot move-)

Alicia: *She floated closer to Pepper and snatched one of the ribbons off her waist.* "And-" *She contained her victorious excitement, reaching for the other.*

Pepper: *Her golden eyes shined and she twitched, shattering the ice around her.* "Hermph-" *She reached behind her back and spun around, slamming the mallet into Alicia's face.*

Alicia: *She blasted through several clouds, with her arms swaying in a limp-like manner.* (Arh, my face!-) *Blood ran down her nose, causing her to hold it in pain.*

Blake: "Whoa!" *He chuckled with amazement.* "Did ya see that? She got smashed!-"

Luna: "Kool."

Rachael: "I agree." *She smirked and formed a fist.*

Pepper: *She looked down at her remaining ribbon.* "From the gap in our experiences, she should consider that alone, a victory-" *She mumbled and looked back up, watching Alicia continue to fly back.*

Alicia: (Stop-) *Her wings flared and shined, causing her to stop.*

Pepper: "Majestic light, motion forth and put forward what is inevitable, the ancient twilight power of the radiant beings grant me all your strength, all spirits bow down to this almighty power, I say tremble and wither down before my knees, to fight me such is your reward-"

Alicia: *Blood gushed down her arm, causing her to squirm in an awkward manner.* (It won't stop bleeding!)

Lezard: (Looks like several of her blood vessels burst-)

Pepper: *She casually raised her arm by her cheek and white lines materialised in the air around her.* "SACRED SWARM"

Alicia: *She noticed a large white glyph form itself behind Pepper, causing her to become defensive.* "Ougi."

Pepper: *She swayed her arms back and threw them in front towards Alicia, causing the glyph to shine.* "Hermph-"

*Thick blinding streams of light erupted out from the glyph and past Pepper, leaving trails of glittering dust-like light behind them.*

Alicia: *She stared at Pepper, listening to missile-like screeches echo in the distance.* "Please come to my aid and fight alongside me, Ice Dragoon."

Pepper: (You did well.) *She watched the nearby clouds swirl around the streams of light, as they spiralled like missiles towards Alicia.*

Alicia: *She watched five ice dragon-like sculptures materialise in front of her.* (Get Pepper!-)

*The streams of light spiralled into striking distance and hit the ice sculptures, causing a flash of light to echo the sounds of shattering glass.*

Pepper: *She watched miniature explosions of light flash like lightning in the clouds around Alicia.* (Dead on target-) *She pushed herself forward and blasted towards Alicia.*

*The lights dissipated and disintegrated into tiny white orbs, blowing away in the wind.*

Alicia: "A-Ah-" *Chunks of ice shattered around her and plummeted through the sky.*

Pepper: *She flew past Alicia, snatching the other ribbon.* "I say, got it."

Madora: *She looked confused.* (Does this mean the match is over? I'm not sure if I should announce it or not.)

Alicia: (My Ice Dragoons.. Were instantly-..) *She started to slowly fall, due to lack of concentration.* (Those lights...)

Pepper: *She opened her hand and watched the ribbon spiral away.* "The match has ended."

Alicia: "Y-Yes." *She spoke under her breath as if she knew she couldn't fight any more.*

Madora: *She nodded her head.* (That's all I needed to know-) "It appears Alicia has lost the match, Pepper wins!"

*Madora watched the sky slowly revert back into the arena, causing Alicia and Pepper to float towards the ground.*

Pepper: *She gently stepped on the dirt, causing her armour to rattle.* "..."

Alicia: *A gust of wind caused her pain-filled face to disappear.* "Argh." *She coughed and wiped her face, watching the blood disappear.*

Pepper: "Alicia." *She slowly walked up to her, smiling in a guilty manner.*

Alicia: "L-Let's get off the arena."

Pepper: (I'm always too rough-) "S-Sure."

Madora: *She watched Pepper walk with Alicia out of the arena.* "Next is-"

PKMY: *She stormed into the arena and smirked, rubbing her hands in excitement.* "Finally-"

Lance: *He ran into the arena and smirked, stopping in the middle.* "It was bound to happen, aye."

PKMY: "Wat?"

Lance: "Us fightin', idiot-"

PKMY: "You're the idiot."

Madora: "Please choose your scenery."

Lance: "Wateva."

PKMY: "Wateva your wateva, so wateva and shut it wateva and, oh yeah? Wateva!" *She grunted, folding her arms in anger.*

Lance: "Jeez, I was just gonna ask how you're feelin'-"

PKMY: "Wat?"

Lance: "Pssht, aha. Like I care what you're feelin'-"

PKMY: "Shut it-" *She grunted, watching the area blur and swirl around her.* ".. But, I do agree with you, though."

Lance: "Aye?"

PKMY: "Here-" *She closed her eyes and concentrated, causing a flashback to trigger in Lance's head.*

--

PKMY: *She bent at the knees, flashstepping high into the sky.* "Airs pulsing, searing and soaring-"

Teresa: (She intends to finish the battle now!)

Lance: "Not that move again." *He placed one foot back, looking up with a mature expression on his face.*

PKMY: "Try blocking this." *She raised her arms above her head, causing the atmosphere to distort around her.* "Rippling strike."

Lance: (I've got to put every ounce of energy into this one shot.) *He stabbed the sword into the ground, taking a deep breath.*

PKMY: "Harh!" *She dropped her arm, releasing a red rippling beam of light towards Lance.*

Lance: "Smear upon the skies, blue waves crashing down-" *He placed both hands in front of each other, yelling at the top of his breath.* "LIGHTNING BLAST"

*Bright yellow lightning blasted towards PKMY's rippling beam of light.*

Teresa: *She watched the Rostical collide, causing an abnormally loud humming sound to echo across the plains.* (PKMY, you are using at least thirteen percent of your maximum power-)

Lance: *His hair whipped to each side, as the lightning pushed back and forth.* (I can feel a vibration going right up into bone-)

*The grass under the Rostical suddenly burnt and scorched into flames, as violent gusts of wind pulsed across the plains.*

Teresa: (These level of Neurons are too high-) "PKMY, you have to stop or this location can be detected by Neuron and Astragon readers!"

*The loud humming drowned out Teresa's voice, as strings of lightning flashed vein-like in the air.*

Lance: *He glanced at his hands, noticing blood seeping through his fingernails.* (I can't hold it for much longer-)

PKMY: *She remained in the air, as swirls of fluoro red waves blew past her.* (One day, I can't wait to fight this dickhead at my full capacity.)

Lance: *His face wrinkled in pain, as he whimpered with lowering morale.* "N-No-"

*The humming suddenly stopped, as an explosion erupted, spewing out black smog.*

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She covered her face, watching Lance and PKMY smash across the ground.*

PKMY: "Herh!-"
Lance: "Ooof!"

Teresa: "This match is officially over!"

--

Lance: "..." (Whoa.. That was ages ago.)

PKMY: "So, yea, shithead. I've been keen to fight you for a while now too. But no limiters this time."

Rachael: *She watched the arena change, causing her to smile.* "Look, Luna."

Luna: "Wow-"

Destiny: "Yeup!" *She purred in amazement, causing Luna and Rachael to giggle.*

Blake: "Is this?"

Luna: "Yea.."

Blake: "Sexy." *He nodded his head in approval.*

Mio: (Their world.. Fascinating.)

Blake: "Fufufu, even Mio's amazed."

Luna: "Aha."

Mio: (Don't be so bothersome.)

PKMY: *She awkwardly stood on cement, looking to each side in shock.* "What..?"

Lance: "Heh, you like?"

PKMY: *She stood in the middle of a car park, standing at the front of Fast Food Enterprise.* "Where-?"

Lance: *He flared his nose and took a deep breath, causing him to glance at the store.* (I can even smell work..)

PKMY: *She spun around in complete confusion, awkwardly glancing at the cars around her.* "Where am I?"

Lance: "Aha." *He smirked and clicked his fingers, causing lightning to stream out of his hand.*

PKMY: *Her eye twitched, watching the lightning form into a sword.* "Don't laugh at me because I asked a question!"

Madora: *She sighed at their bickering.* "PKMY versus. Lance!-"

Chapter 19: PKMY Versus. Lance

Madora: "Let the battle begin!"

PKMY: "Alright, prepare yourself, try hard."

Lance: "Oh yea?!"

PKMY: "Yea-" *She formed a fist and flashstepped.*

Lance: *He quickly shuffled back and accidentally hit a car behind him.* (This is Earth, it's my turf. Aha, did I just rhyme? Yea, 'cause this match is mine! Man, I've become lame-)

PKMY: *She suddenly fell from the sky and karate chopped Lance's lightning sword, causing its stream to break.* "Double Smack-"

*The lightning travelled up PKMY's arm causing her to grit her teeth in pain.*

PKMY: (The Rasticsplash-)

Lance: *He noticed PKMY twitch, causing him to stick out his tongue.* "Ha, sucked in-"

PKMY: "Tssk-" *She grunted with widening eyes and ignored the pain, punching towards Lance's face.*

Lance: "Arh-" *He quickly leant on a side and watched PKMY's fist smash through the car's window, causing its alarm to go off.*

Blake: "Eww-" *He covered his ears in disgust.* "What's that feral sound, aye?"

Nathan: "Turn your hearing down."

Blake: "Yea, yea."

Lezard: "I agree, Blakey-boy. That sound is pretty horrid to the ears."

PKMY: *She cartwheeled to the side and kicked Lance in the ribs.* "Harh!"

Lance: *He leant to one side in pain.* "Argh-"

PKMY: *She quickly punched Lance in the gut, causing the car's windows to shatter.* "Not so funny now, eh, shithead?"

Lance: "Nah, it's hilarious aye-"

PKMY: *She frowned, glancing to her side at Fast Food Enterprise.* "Arh!"

*PKMY spun around and kicked Lance at blinding speeds, knocking him towards the store.*

Lance: *He tumbled across the car park and grunted, quickly standing back up.* "Oi, PKMY?"

PKMY: *She faced Lance and took a step forward, listening to glass crunch under her foot.* "Wat?"

Lance: "How can you walk in the daylight? You're like, a redhead 'n' stuff-"

PKMY: *She flashstepped on Lance's side and kicked him across the face.* "Hah!"

Lance: *He staggered back and touched a small graze mark on his cheek, caused by PKMY's kick.* (Damn she kicks hard-)

PKMY: "Show me respect!-" *She yelled with fury and kicked Lance with her whole body, smashing him through Fast Food Enterprise's doors.*

Luna: (Aha, you should my stupid brother!)

Rachael: "Why couldn't they fight at our old school? Would've been good to see that get smashed up instead."

Luna: "Aha! I reckon."

PKMY: "Yahoo-" *She smirked with confidence and ran towards the store.*

Lance: *He hit the dining room floor and slid on his back with his legs kicking the air.* "Shit-" *He swept several chairs, causing them to tumble on top of him.*

PKMY: *She dived through the hole in the door and rolled on the floor.* "Heh." *She stood up and wiped glass off her back.*

Lance: *He hit his head on a table leg, causing him to stop.* "Argh-"

PKMY: *She casually walked on the shattered glass across the dining room.* "Heh." *She smiled at Lance, who awkwardly stood back up.*

Lance: "Wipe the smirk off ya face, dirty redhead-"

PKMY: *She jumped forward giving the illusion she flew across the floor.* "Shut it-" *She jumped into striking distance, visibly tensing her leg muscles.*

Lance: *He stepped to the side in shock and his foot slid on a piece of glass.* "Crap-"

PKMY: "Try hard!-" *She spun around and kicked Lance across the face.*

Lance: "Oof-" *He twirled to the side and leant over the table, spitting out blood.*

PKMY: *She flipped forward onto Lance's back and kicked her legs, forcing him across the table.* "Heh-"

Rachael: "She's riding him like an animal, how embarrassing."

Lezard: "Eww, it's Battling Oxident gone wild!"

Lance: *He frowned as his face rubbed against the table.* "Get the hell off me!-"

PKMY: *She bent her knees and jumped off Lance's back, spiralling into the air.* "Did you know, when we first fought, I used a little over ten percent of my power?"

Lance: "I know you're a teacher 'n' all-" *He pushed himself off the table, wiping the smeared blood off his face.*

PKMY: "..." *She moved in the air slowly, staring at Lance in a curious manner.*

Lance: "But, ten percent? Sorry, I didn't sign up for maths-"

*Lance formed a cup with his hand and spun around in a fluid motion, pushing a stream of lightning towards PKMY.*

Lance: "LIGHTNING BLAST"

PKMY: "Eh?" *Her grin instantly faded as she watched the lightning blast towards her.* "Tssk-"

*PKMY crossed her arms in front of her face in a defensive manner, bracing herself for the lightning.*

Lance: *He awkwardly stepped to the side, causing the lightning to stream past PKMY.* "Dammit."

PKMY: *She looked to her side startled.* "Haha, you missed me! Wat an idiot-"

*The lights on the ceiling around PKMY suddenly exploded sparks, causing the crowd to awe.*

Karol: "What happened?"

Rachael: "I think he missed due to his fluid, blind-like body movement."

Karol: "But, how?"

Rachael: "Kinda like spinning around and then throwing a rock, your aim isn't the best."

Karol: "Ah! Fanks, Waichael."

Lance: "Pssht." *He smiled and faced PKMY, watching her slowly fall down.* "You gotta teach me how to move in the air so slowly like that, it'd be kool."

PKMY: *Sparks flashed in front of her face, causing her to look disorientated.* "Tssk, you gotta show me you're worth training-"

Lance: "Rightio. Roar with the skies might-"

PKMY: (Incantation to Thunder Boom?) "You know, I'm good with sound-based attacks-"

Lance: "Good for you then-" *He looked down at the dining room table and punched towards it, causing a rumble of thunder to knock it off its hinges.* "THUNDER BOOM"

Lezard: *He watched the table spiral up and hit PKMY, knocking her out of the air.* (Using the available tools around him, marvellous, Lance-)

PKMY: *She awkwardly landed on the chairs Lance had knocked across the floor beforehand, causing her to wheeze over its leg.* "Stupid-" *She grunted and swayed her hand, snapping the chair's leg with ease.*

Lance: *He glanced to the counter and ran towards it, listening to the chairs tumble across the floor.* "Come and get me, fugly oranga baboon-like monsta."

PKMY: "Wat you call me?!" *She growled in anger and kicked the ground, causing a force to push herself back onto her feet.*

Nathan: *He watched the chairs spiral away from PKMY.* "And I thought Luna was crazy-"

Luna: "Oi?!"

Lance: *He readied to jump on to the counter, glancing at PKMY with a childish smirk.* "What did I say? Fugly shit buckets?"

*Lance chuckled and hopped on top of the counter on all fours, looking back to PKMY.*

Lance: "Where-?"

PKMY: *She flashstepped on the counter and kicked downwards towards Lance's face.* "Harh!"

Lance: *He quickly pushed himself to the side and slid off the counter, watching her foot sweep above his face.* (Close-)

PKMY: *She awkwardly spun around and kicked a register screen, smashing it to pieces.* "Shit-"

Lance: *He stepped behind the counter and quickly ducked, watching parts of the register stab into the condiments bar behind him.* (So strong!-)

Lezard: (He barely avoided that-)

PKMY: *She grunted in frustration and turned around, watching Lance run towards the back.* (Why does he keep fleeing?)

Lance: *He quickly wiped blood off his cheek, noticing cut-like slashes on his arm.* (I know I had shit days at work, but now I can officially say I had the damn register logged into me-)

PKMY: *She flashstepped on top of the fry station, causing fries to spiral around her feet.* (He's slow to react, but his reactions are almost instantaneous-)

*PKMY ran on her toes across the oil in the fry machines, watching Lance run down the production line.*

PKMY: "Come here!"

Lance: "Nope."

PKMY: "You stupid dick!"

Lance: "At least I don't look like one!"

PKMY: "Grr!" (The lack of respect!-) *She grunted in frustration and jumped high into the air, grabbing hold of the ceiling with the palm of her hands.*

*The deep fryer PKMY jumped off suddenly cracked and exploded oil, burning the plastic around it.*

PKMY: *She placed her feet on the ceiling, ignoring the salt which sprinkled off her shoes.* "Tssk-"

Ginger: (That Rosterology device with the boiling liquid, fascinating.)

PKMY: *She raised her arms and hung off the ceiling, glancing at Lance from a bird's eye view.* (Just focus the Astragons around the soles of my feet-)

Lance: "Aye?" *He looked up as he ran through the kitchen towards the crew room.* "You're a spider now? Suits you well-"

PKMY: "Tssk-" *She ran upside down along the ceiling, acting as if it was the ground.*

Lance: (For someone who is really strong, she gets angry pretty easily-)

PKMY: "AIR SWIRL" *A visible green airwave knocked Lance around the ankles.*

Lance: "Sh-Shit-" *He tripped on his foot and headbutted the window to the manager's office.*

PKMY: "Heh-" *She spiralled down and landed on one foot with ease.* "Crippling might, twenty two finger wind gales strike." *Her fists vibrated and her arms became invisible.*

Rachael: "Can't she get, that he's taunting her?"

Lezard: "She's hot-headed?" *He shrugged his shoulders, adjusting his cone-shaped hat.*

Lance: *He leant against the wall and stood up, as PKMY stormed up to him.* "Hey now, don't be all serious 'n' stuff-"

PKMY: "Grarh!" *She punched towards Lance's face.*

Lance: *He quickly moved to the side and watched five fist marks crack the glass before shattering it.* "Th-That was bulletproof!-"

Karol: (She threw one punch and five cracks appeared on the glass!-)

PKMY: *She pulled her arm to the side and threw another punch towards Lance's face.* "Harh!"

Lance: *He raised his arm while shuffling to the side.* "MAGNETIC RUMBLE" *A white shield expanded from his arm.*

PKMY: "Tssk-" *She punched the shield, creating a loud thunder rumble.*

Lance: *His eyes widened with surprise as he watched PKMY's fist vibrate against his shield.* "Y-Yea, my shield is unbreakable!-"

PKMY: "Heh-" *She pushed her fist further into the shield, causing it to shatter.*

Lance: (Man, she's crazy-) *He turned around and prepared to sprint towards the stockroom at the back.*

PKMY: *She noticed Lance's left hand sway back, causing her to grab it at blinding speeds.* "Gotcha!"

Lance: "Pssht-" *He grunted, trying to slip his hand out of her grip.*

PKMY: "Harh!" *She spun around and punched his elbow, causing the bone to crack out of his skin.*

Lance: "Arh!" *He yelled in pain which echoed down the hallway.*

PKMY: "Now for the other-"

Lance: "No!-" *He stepped forward and faced PKMY with his eyes watering.*

PKMY: "Naw, gonna cry-?"

Lance: "LIGHTNING PULSE" *He pushed his right hand at PKMY and a blue ring of lightning slammed her back into the kitchen.*

PKMY: *She stumbled back and fell onto her back, sliding all the way down the kitchen.* "Tssk-"

Lance: *He took a moment to stare at his left arm in pain and shock.* (Come on-)

*Lance sniffed and took a deep breath before running towards the back.*

Lance: (I've got a plan-) *He gritted his teeth, purposely trying not to look at his arm.* (I hope it doesn't fall through though.)

Luna: (Despite how my brother acts to others, he's actually quite the cry baby, like Tyler..)

Destiny: (So, nobody knows?)

Luna: (Nope.)

PKMY: *She watched Lance run out of her vision, causing her to frown in anger.* (He's probably going to hide, then attack me from behind something-)

*PKMY frowned in thought and slowly stood up, brushing grease off her legs.*

PKMY: "Well, your little plan won't work!"

Lance: *He quickly ripped a fire extinguisher off the wall and ran towards a door at the end.* (Alright, almost there-)

PKMY: "Ougi-" *She bit her finger causing blood to run down her hand.* "Incantation Exploitation."

Lance: *He kneeled against the door and held the fire extinguisher in between his legs, pulling the trigger with his right hand.* (Alright-)

PKMY: "METEOR SWARM" *She raised her arms towards the ceiling and closed her eyes.*

*A large red glyph spiralled in the air above the Fast Food Enterprise store.*

Ginger: "Despite getting warmed up, it was illogical of her not to use that Remenistal sooner."

*Several meteors engulfed with bright flames suddenly plummeted out of the glyph and smashed into the store.*

Lezard: "Oh my-"

*The meteors caused all windows to burst at the same time and a massive explosion caused bright flames to erupt out of the roof.*

Luna: "I can feel the heat on my cheeks! Did that get Lance?"

Nathan: "What about PKMY? She was standing in the complex too? She was completely vulnerable."

Rachael: "Rostical, that's your department, Ginger."

Ginger: "It is possible to lessen the power of Remenistal at a cost of it not harming you."

Rachael: (Kinda like friendly fire-)

Blake: "Then why doesn't everyone like, do that?"

Ginger: "The drastic drop of power is sometimes not worth it, and besides-" *She coughed to clear her throat.* "Only powerful Remenistal Users can use such a highly advanced technique."

Rachael: "You saying she's not?"

Ginger: "Oh, I never said that."

*The doors to the store flew across the car park, catching the crowd's attention.*

PKMY: *She power walked out of the doors, ignoring the scorching flames around her.* "Heh, I sure showed him."

*PKMY stopped and leant to one side, looking up in confusion.*

PKMY: (Why hasn't Madora ended the match yet?)

Lance: *He jumped out from behind a car and straightened his right hand at PKMY.* "Like old times?"

PKMY: "How did you get out-?" *She spoke under her breath and shook her head, hiding her shock.* "Wateva."

Lance: "Smear upon the skies, blue waves crashing down, LIGHTNING BLAST"

PKMY: "This will be stronger." *She faced Lance and raised her arms.* "Airs pulsing, searing and soaring, rippling strike."

Lance: *He fired a stream of lightning which blasted towards PKMY.* (I hope this gets her-)

PKMY: *She dropped her arms towards Lance, releasing a rippling red beam of light.* (Now, at my full strength-)

*The attacks connected causing an abnormal loud humming sound to echo throughout the area.*

Destiny: (They're evenly matched-)

*Strong pockets of wind blew across the car park, blowing rubbish and dirt into the air.*

Lance: *He focused with all his concentration, ignoring strings of lightning which flashed in front of his face.* (It's not budgin'.)

PKMY: *She looked shocked.* (The beam hasn't moved forward, and I'm going all-out?!)

Luna: *She noticed the air slightly warp under Lance and PKMY's attack.* (It's like their attacks are heatin' up the tar or somethin'?)

PKMY: *Her hair flapped back and forth, due to the random bursts of wind.* (I won't be able to keep this up-)

Lance: (Time for some Elementalist bendin' aye-) *He drifted his attention from PKMY's beam to his lightning.*

Ginger: (The Neuronic cost for each attack are vastly different, but her Azure Burst is comparable to his Remenistal.)

Lance: (Shit, I think the tar is startin' to melt!) *He focused and watched his lightning move more fluidly, allowing it to swirl around PKMY's beam.*

Ginger: *She slightly squinted her eyes in an envious manner, playing with her robes.* (That must be the Elementalist power within him.)

PKMY: *She noticed the lightning swirl towards her.* (Stupid boy-) *She bent her knees and jumped high into the air, causing her beam to fade away.*

Lance: "Pssht-" *He looked up with gritted teeth as if he wasn't expecting PKMY to move out of the way.*

PKMY: *She looked down and watched the swirling lightning spark and scatter away.* (Our powers were even!)

Lance: *He puffed and ached in pain, causing him to glance at his arm.* (Damn, I can't focus properly with the damn bone stickin' out-)

PKMY: *She landed heavily on the ground and smirked at Lance as sweat dripped off her chin.* "Boy, I'm gonna break your other arm." *She threatened him with a slight sense of respect.*

Lance: "Oh yea?" *He stepped back and his foot slightly sunk into the soft tar, hiding his pain.*

PKMY: "For the last time, yea!" *She stood up straight and ran towards Lance with her arms swaying behind her back.*

Lance: "I know this area really well-" *He took several more steps back and suddenly ran behind a car out of PKMY's vision.*

PKMY: "There's no point in hiding-" *She ran towards the car Lance ran behind and started to flip towards it.* "Doesn't matter what kind of Rosterology device you hide behind-"

Lezard: "Jinkies! What the Astragons is he planning?"

PKMY: "I'll just blow everything that can hide your measly arse-" *She jumped on top of the car and looked down, noticing Lance pointing the fire extinguisher at her.*

Lance: "True-" *He sprayed white foam in PKMY's face and threw the extinguisher at her.*

PKMY: *She closed her eyes and instinctively caught the extinguisher.* "AIR SWIRL"

*A gust of wind blew the blinding foam away, causing Luna to roll her eyes.*

Luna: "A fire extinguisher? Now he's just lookin' petty."

PKMY: "Cheap tricks?! Giving yourself more time to flee-?"

Lance: "Nope-" *He hopped on one foot as swirls of red lightning flashed around him.*

PKMY: "Wat are you doing-?"

Lance: "DRAGON'S BREATH" *He hopped forward and punched the air towards PKMY.* "Harh." *A house-sized swirl of lightning flared towards PKMY.*

PKMY: "It's not incantation-boosted, even in my state, I can withstand it!"

Lance: "Number one, I don't think ya can-"

PKMY: "You don't think? I'll take this Rostical without even flinching!-"

Lance: *He ignored PKMY's taunt.* "Number two, I know this area well-"

*The lightning hit PKMY and sparked in between her arms and legs.*

PKMY: *She endured the lightning, grunting with a sense of struggle.* "You keep saying that-"

Lance: *His left arm twitched with pain as sweat ran in between his eyes and down his nose.* (You think I could've picked a less humid day, aye-)

PKMY: *She stopped twitching and looked at the lightning, causing her to smirk in accomplishment.* "See-?"

*The lightning sparked through PKMY's body before swirling down into the car.*

PKMY: "Heh, I didn't feel a thing-" *The extinguisher in her arms suddenly exploded, causing her to awkwardly sway back.*

Lance: *He quickly ducked and squinted his eyes, covering his face with his right arm.* (Whoa-)

Rachael: *She looked surprised.* (Using the fire extinguisher like that, how I didn't see that-?)

*The car under PKMY suddenly exploded into a violent mushroom-like blaze.*

Luna: "Holy shit!-"
Lezard: "Wowza!"
Karol: "Eek-"

Lance: "I also know the things in the area, and I know cars blow up." *He dropped to his knees and sighed in a victorious manner.*

Madora: *She watched a trail of thick black smoke rise away from the flames.* "That didn't look good." *She whispered to herself in shock.*

PKMY: *She closed her eyes in pain as she leant forward and collapsed off the burning car.* (It hurts-)

Madora: *She looked through the smoke and flames, noticing PKMY lay unconscious on the cement.* "It appears PKMY is unable to battle, Lance is the winner!"

Blake: *He watched the area revert back to normal, revealing PKMY lay motionless on the dirt.* (Amy..)

Lance: *He stared at PKMY ignoring the revitalising wind.* "Ouch-" *He grunted in pain and looked at his arm in shock.* (The bone-?) *He raised his left arm and noticed it was healed.*

PKMY: *She twitched and moaned.* "A-Garh-"

Lance: *He ran up to PKMY and bent down to see if she was alright.* "Hey-?"

PKMY: "Good work."

Lance: *He smirked with surprise and gratitude.* "You too aye."

PKMY: "Can it, I lost."

Lance: *He helped her onto her feet.* "Are you good to walk?"

PKMY: "Yea."

Lance: "Just in case, I totally didn't mean anythin' I said." *He scratched his nose, awkwardly looking away.*

PKMY: "Heh-" *She smirked and punched Lance on the shoulder before flashstepping out of the arena.*

Lance: *He rubbed his shoulder in pain.* "Oi, wat was that for?! I just apologised!" *He flashstepped out of the arena after PKMY.*

Madora: "Next is-"

Season: *He hobbled into the arena holding the trident to his side.* (I have to go all-out. I've learnt from my match with PKMY that this won't be easy-)

Teresa: *Her image appeared in the middle of the arena, causing a pulse of dirt to swirl around her.* "..."

Season: "Terra.." *He mumbled under his breath, catching her attention.*

Teresa: *She stared at Season with an emotionless face.* "Are you sure regarding your intentions to fight me?"

Season: "I could say the same to you."

Teresa: "Hoh?"

Madora: "Please choose your scenery!"

Teresa: "Nevertheless, this is for you." *She closed her eyes and smiled, focusing her attention on her thoughts.*

Season: "For me-?"

*The arena blurred and swirled, slowly becoming white in colour.*

Season: "This-" *He watched the arena change, causing him to look around in awe.* "This is Valhalla, isn't it?"

Teresa: "Indeed."

Season: (Amazing..) *He chuckled in thought, listening to the crowd's excited reaction.*

Teresa: "This location-.." *She admired the scenery, triggering a flashback.*

--

Locki: *He squinted his eyes due to the setting sun.* (It's getting dark in here-) *He clicked his fingers, causing fire to ignite in torches around the castle.*

Lance: *He looked around startled, staring at a nearby torch.* (Shit, that scared me.)

Teresa: *She looked over her shoulder, watching the moon slowly rise.* (Sunset already?)

PKMY: (Time here is slightly different? Maybe due to the Astragons or even these Radiatons?)

Millard: "I'm really sorry for interrupting, but I need to go, it's urgent."

Celest: "I know you can be trusted-"

Locki: "But this needs to be said."

Celest: "Regarding The Divine Path-"

Lance: "Yea? How come three people couldn't come through the aura thingo?" *He rudely interrupted Celest, pointing behind him like a child.*

Locki: (How annoying.)
PKMY: (Interrupting asshat.)

Celest: "People with Sha-, dark arts, Scoldrants, sickened Scoldrants, Neuron damage and any other non-divine beings, are not allowed through."

Lance: "Oh."

Millard: "You were saying, Celest?"

Celest: "If any one of you reveal our presence, you all will be punished."

Millard: "Of course." *He spoke with respect, looking at each party member.* "The party nodded their heads in agreement-"

Locki: "You are free to leave."

Lance: "Umm-"

Locki: "What is it?" *He grunted with annoyance and authority.*

Lance: "Me and cow-cow pow-meow stinky-foul, are goin' too."

Locki: *He tilted his head in confusion.* "Who?"

Alicia: *She lowered her head.* "Me." *She looked at Teresa and PKMY.* "Teresa? PKMY?"

PKMY: (I'm staying here.) *She ignored Alicia, rudely looking away.*

Teresa: "We will meet you back at Surpreon."

PKMY: "..."

Teresa: "There are several things we need to know."

Alicia: "O-Okay."

Millard: "Let's go."

Celest: "The glyphic platform will not activate without Radiatons."

Lance: "Then how-?"

Celest: "..." *She waved her hand across Millard, Alicia and Lance, causing them to disappear in a flash of white light.*

PKMY: "Eh? Where did they go?"

Locki: *He closed his eyes, taking a deep breath.* "On The Divine Path."

--

Teresa: "It is the hallway of the massive castle the party and myself walked upon with Millard."

Season: "I see."

Madora: "Season versus. Teresa-"

Chapter 20: Season Versus. Teresa

Madora: "Let the battle begin!"

Teresa: "I have noticed you have released The Trident of Memories."

Season: "Well, with an opponent like yourself, it's to be expected."

Teresa: "I see. I will now engage in combat."

Season: "Thank you for the warning-"

Teresa: "Humph-" *Her image disappeared and she reappeared directly above Season.*

Season: "Defensive winds, swirl and soar, offensive gusts, grand winds blow throughout my spirit, tunnel its power through the almighty clouds and pierce anything that stands in its way-"

Teresa: "Typhoon's Pulse." *She spoke with an emotionless tone, pointing downwards.*

Season: "DIVINE TORNADO" *He pointed the trident up and a massive gale blasted Teresa high into the air.*

Teresa: *She spiralled and tumbled in the air before slamming into the ceiling, cracking it upon impact.* "Tcch-"

Ginger: (My Remenistal counterpart, I will enjoy our fight, Season.)

Season: *He watched Teresa place her hands on the ceiling to regain her composure, as green lines started to draw themselves on the ground around him.* "Power of the white lights absorb and synthesise the natural power, patiently gather and redirect at the supreme power you hold and lend us-, SOLAR FLARE"

*Season grabbed the trident with both hands and pushed it up, causing a huge white beam with fluoro blue shading to flare towards Teresa.*

Teresa: *She looked down surprised as the area lit up around her.* (His large roster of Rostical makes him a tricky opponent to-) *Her image disappeared the moment the beam crashed into the ceiling, causing chunks of white rock to fall towards the floor.*

Season: *He glanced around and noticed several blue flowers sprout from the floor.* "Might, strength, fury, courage, form these emotions in array of mighty pillars, GROUND SHAKING"

*Season hit the trident next to his feet and the ground curved with a pulse, squishing the flowers flat.*

Rachael: (Nice. He pulsed the ground like it was water! It took me ages to acquire that level of power.)

Teresa: *She flashstepped directly in front of Season, kicking towards his face.* "Long-range-"

Season: "PIERCING CLOUDS" *He swayed his trident, causing a stream of cloud-like smog to crash on top of Teresa's foot.*

Teresa: *She kicked the smog and blasted back, sliding across the floor.* "Typhoon's Pulse."

Season: "WIND'S PULSE" *He waved his hand and watched a ring of wind spiral at the end of his trident, jabbing it forward.*

*A pulse of wind whooshed in between Teresa and Season, suddenly cracking the ground underneath it*

Teresa: *She flashstepped next to Season and swayed at an angle, elegantly elbowing to the side of his head.* "Hmph-"

Season: *He spun around her elbow, slicing a wave of lightning in her face.* "LIGHTNING SLICE"

Teresa: *She swayed back and stepped to the side, hitting the lightning away all in one fluid-like motion.* "Tcch-"

Season: "AQUA LIQUID" *He swayed the trident up, causing a wave of water to slap Teresa in an uppercut manner.*

Teresa: *Her image suddenly disappeared, causing the water to unnaturally splash back into its original manner.* "Flora-"

Season: *He gasped and quickly spun around, jabbing a stream of thick lightning from the tip of the trident towards Teresa.* "LIGHTNING BLAST"

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She frowned and stepped back with a disappearing image, causing the lightning to blast straight through where she stood.*

Season: *He frowned and looked to each side, raising the trident in a defensive manner.* "Hmm.."

Teresa: *She appeared behind a large pillar and peaked to the side, discreetly staring at Season with a frown.* "Tcch-"

Karol: "Holy Neurons, what a battle."

Blake: "Fufufu, damn rite, fam."

Karol: "Nee hee." *He giggled at Blake, focusing his attention back to the arena.*

Ginger: (His Remenistal skills easily equals my own. He used two Grand Remenistal with ease while showing no signs of fatigue.)

Destiny: *She stared at Season with altered vision, watching an aura sway around him only she could see.* (He's scared.)

Luna: *She reacted surprised to Destiny's observation.* (Really? Doesn't seem like it-)

Season: "My Rostical explodes deep in the hot abyss, with the seraphic blood I wish to end this battle! DIMENSION CRISIS" *He quickly pointed the trident to his side at a nearby pillar.*

Teresa: *She watched Season point the trident directly towards her.* "How did he-?"

*Teresa stepped forward and flashstepped as a purple firework exploded the space around the pillar, causing pockets of dust to swirl away from the cracks.*

Lezard: "Wowza-"

Season: "Lightning pulse like veins, true power recharge and discharge and flow through the easiest current, LIGHTNING STRIKE" *He raised his arm and two streams of lightning spiralled down, swirling around the trident.*

Lezard: *He adjusted his cone-shaped hat, watching the two streams of lightning swirl around Season's trident in a controlled manner.* "First ground, then wind, then water and now straight to lightning. He must be powerful."

Ginger: "Ey, Lezard, that much is evident." *She nodded her head in agreement, twitching with excitement.*

Teresa: *She flashstepped far down the hallway and watched Season drop the trident to his feet.* (I understand Rostical can strike from afar, but there is no way-)

*A thick stream of lightning struck through the ceiling and blasted towards Teresa, bursting debris into the air.*

Teresa: (How does he know where I flashstep-?) *She stepped forward and her image disappeared, barely avoiding the lightning which cracked the stone floor.*

Luna: "That was close!-"

Destiny: "Yeup!"

Rachael: (His lightning's speed even rivals some of Luna's Rostical-)

Season: *He spun around and pointed the trident behind him.* "Icy swirls draw to the skies, frosted water lend me your power, GLACIA'S EDGE"

Teresa: *Her image appeared in front of Season.* "Magnanimity-" *A thick ice pillar erupted up and shot towards her chest.* "Tcch-" *She raised her hand and flicked it to the side, smashing the ice away effortlessly.*

Season: "Taste the power of crushing currents, devour the sacred waters, AQUA LIQUID" *He waved the trident across Teresa and a large wave rumbled above her on one side.*

Teresa: *She bent at the knees and pointed at the water.* "Typhoon's Pulse." *She pushed forward and the water crashed prematurely.*

Season: "Frostic stars, rain forth, FRIGID STORM" *Swirls of ice needles spiralled underneath Teresa before erupting up into the air.*

Ginger: (Frigid Storm's power is boosted by the previous Remenistal's water, very skilled!-)

Teresa: *The needle-like ice slashed her arms, causing small strings of blood to run down her hands.* "Shattering gravel feel the heat of courage, burning passion fuel this dark void, VOLCANIC ERUPTION"

*The ground cracked underneath Teresa and an eruption of lava exploded around her, instantly melting the ice.*

Karol: "Sh-She just used the fire on herself?!"

Rachael: *She nodded her head and thought to herself, triggering a flashback of PKMY using Flaming Wheel on herself.* "I think she's using it to melt the ice."

Ginger: (She is definitely skilled enough to lower her Neurons to the point of self-immunity.)

Season: *He stared at the wall of lava which blocked his vision of Teresa.* "Drums of terror from the skies, flash down and amplify-"

Teresa: *She raised her arm and formed a fist, causing the remaining ice to crumble away.* (The ice has successfully melted-)

Season: *He spun around and raised his free hand, firmly holding onto a streaming lightning lance.* "LIGHTNING SLICE"

*Season quickly stepped back and lunged forward, throwing the lightning lance at the lava.*

Teresa: (Now, I will increase my physical prowess and strike him in a critical area-) *She flicked her hand and the lava swirled away.* "Huh-?"

*The lightning lance hit the ground in front of Teresa and instantly flashed, violently electrocuting her.*

Lezard: "How did it-?" *He mumbled to himself and leant forward, taking a closer look.*

Rachael: (I see! The water left by the melting ice-)

Season: "Powers of the proud brown, beat and skip through the winds, GRAVEL'S PULSE" *He flicked the trident above him and a ring of rocks burst in front of Teresa's face, knocking her back.*

Teresa: *She stumbled out of the puddle and gritted her teeth, waving a clustered dirt cloud away from her face.* "Tccsht-"

Karol: "Th-This is the first time I've seen that sckary woman being hurt."

Nathan: "I agree-"

Ginger: "That is the power of a Remenistal User-"

Teresa: "Long-range Lotus." *She kicked the air across Season and a fluoro blue wave stroked towards him.*

Season: "Ground and water draw each other's power, liquefy and harden, LIFA BLOSSOM" *He raised the trident and a tree instantly sprouted out of the ground, blocking the fluoro blue wave.*

Teresa: "Inconceivable, Caesar!" *She grunted in frustration, pointing both hands at Season.* "Winds howling and feeling the cold serenity, soothing compassion rise this empty shell-"

Season: "Endure the piercing sounds, hurricanes might, ball of force-" *He spun around as a swirl of visible wind whirled in front of him.*

Teresa: "CATAGORY NINE"
Season: "FLURRY STYX" *He suddenly stopped and stared at Teresa, hitting the ball of wind with his trident like a bat.*

Teresa: "Humph.." *Powerful winds swirled around her, causing her to stand on the spot in a confident manner.*

Rachael: "I can't really see the wind, but I can definitely hear it."

Lezard: "You're certainly right, Razzypoo."

Blake: "I can visibly see the wind with my eyes, but I don't get wat's happening, hey?"

Ginger: "Ey, Blake? Teresa's wind is swirling around her in a defensive manner, while Season's is condensed into a ball, slowly nudging its way towards her."

Blake: "Now it makes sense. I just see everything whooshing, fufu."

Season: "You better move, Terra-" *He pointed the trident at Teresa, trying to contain his smirk.* "My Rostical isn't something to be taken lightly of."

Teresa: "My Rostical is strong, there is no need to move-"

*The ball of wind shot past Teresa's wind and hit her on the chest, causing her echoing wheeze to be heard.*

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She kneeled down to the ground, ensuring to keep her arms straightened at Season.*

Lezard: "Frozen fish-cakes, she received a critical hit but it didn't stop the flow of her Remenistal."

Nathan: (That's determination.)

Ginger: (Despite my mastery of Remenistal, even I get cancelled out of an incantation if I get hit the wrong way!)

Season: *His robes rapidly flapped, as strong winds blew past him.* (Her Neurons, it's picking up in power. I need to stop her Rostical from gaining any additional power-)

*The tree branches Season created rapidly swayed back due to the wind.*

Season: (One is able to apply consistent Neurons into a Rostical through their body movement-) *He focused his attention to Teresa's arms, causing him to frown in determination.*

Teresa: *She stared at Season with an emotionless face, watching the wind push him back.* (I know what my next three moves will consist of-)

Season: "Spiralling lightning, instantaneously pierce, CRESCENT VOLT HOOK"

Teresa: *A powerful crescent-shaped purple lightning instantaneously pierced her arm, causing her to withdraw it in pain.* "Tcch-"

Season: *He slowly stopped sliding back, as the wind gradually died down.* "Smear upon the skies, blue waves crashing down, LIGHTNING BLAST"

Teresa: (Season-) *She grunted in an annoyed manner, watching steam sizzle around her freshly burnt wound.*

Blake: (This is such a sexy intense match-) *He giggled in a feminine manner and looked to his side, staring at the empty seat next to him.* (Cam, get your butt here, you're missing out..)

Teresa: "Magnanimity Decibel." *She crossed her arms ignoring the pain and watched four blue flower-like glyphs rotate in front of her.*

Season: "Power of the white lights absorb and synthesise the natural power, patiently gather and redirect at the supreme power you hold and lend us-, SOLAR FLARE" *He pointed the trident at Teresa and a white beam with fluoro blue shading blasted towards her.*

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She hissed with widening eyes and flashstepped out of the beam's range, causing the glyphs to shatter away.*

Rachael: "She can't actually set up an attack."

Season: *He looked to his side and noticed Teresa pointing at him.* (Her speed always surprises me-)

Teresa: *She slightly squinted one eye, aiming her finger at Season.* "Typhoon's Pulse."

Season: "Sturdy might show your patience, materialise the condensed nature and hold the crystalline might, stand tall and defend yourself against all harsh conditions, the power of bold and beauty combine, GRANITE COFFIN"

Ginger: (A forbidden Remenistal!)

Teresa: *Her eyes widened and she flashstepped high into the air.* (That is a dangerous move!-) "Season!"

Season: "This is a match-" *He raised the trident and pointed it at Teresa as a massive blue glyph formed itself on the ground around him.* "Water droplet change and transform this place, particles be one and let my power swirl throughout your spirit, open the gate to the lost Astragons taken by your serenity, fill and crush anything that stands in its way, TSUNAMI'S IMPLOSION"

Teresa: "Tcch, Grand Rostical-" *Thick rings of water materialised in the air around her and they suddenly imploded with a rip's current.*

Karol: "Whow-"

Nathan: (Remenistal.. He just stands there.. It's cheap! No skill!)

Season: *He discreetly looked down, watching clear liquid form on the ground.* (As soon as she touches the ground, it will seal her-)

Teresa: "Sacred blood throughout my veins, I say heed thout command, SOUTHERN CROSS" *A gold glyph drew itself underneath her and a flash of blinding light exploded the water around her.*

Season: *He listened to an echoing odd-like hum sound, drawing his attention back on Teresa.* "Blast it-"

Teresa: "Ougi, Bakana Flare." *She frowned and stood on the air, pointing two fingers at Season.*

Season: *He watched the water float around Teresa as if there was no gravity.* (The nerves are starting to get to me.)

Teresa: "Herh!"

*A huge flare of multi-coloured flames erupted from the floor, crashing like a wave towards Season.*

Blake: *He stared at the flames.* (If that touches him, he's gone.)

Season: "My Rostical explodes deep in the hot abyss, grander than the seven stars of the Astral Plains, blast, ignite, brighten the area with your spectacular array, I shall a-tear your insignificant bonds, with the seraphic blood, this battle will finish! DIMENSION CASCADIA"

*Glyphic rings formed around Season's trident, catching Destiny's attention.*

Destiny: (That's the pretty Rostical he used outside Silver Wind Island!)

Luna: (Ah, the fireworky one?)

Destiny: "Yeup." *She purred in response.*

Teresa: *She pushed forward, causing the flames to swirl over Season.* (This will end the battle-)

*Blasts of red, orange and purple fireworks exploded all around the fire, distorting its shape.*

Season: *His robes flapped in the opposite direction to each firework explosion.* (Now-) *He sighed in exhaustion and leant forward, supporting himself off the trident.*

Ginger: (Not that I am against him, but it is good to finally see some fatigue.)

Season: (I'm finally at my limit-)

Teresa: *She slowly descended, watching the fire extinguish into scattering splinters of flames.* "It appears you are now at your limit." *She pointed at Season.*

Season: "..." *He took deep breaths, looking up to Teresa.*

Teresa: "Despite your calibre in Rostical power, my stamina is far superior to yours-" *She touched the ground, causing the liquid to instantly solidify into crystal up to her waist.*

Season: "Y-You may be correct-" *The trident slipped causing him to fall to his hands.*

Teresa: *She gasped in terror, staring at the crystal with widening eyes.* (This Rostical was still in effect?!)

Season: "Hohoho.."

Teresa: *She squirmed and pointed at the crystal, hiding her fear.* "Typhoon's Pulse."

Ginger: (It is useless-)

Teresa: *Her hair violently and suddenly flicked up as a strong blast of wind hit the crystal.* "Nothing?"

Luna: *She stood up and glanced down the row.* "Excuse me."

*Each guild member focused all their attention to the match, they unintentionally ignored Luna.*

Luna: "Oi, move it."

Lezard: "Ooo, everyone make room for Loonzamotto." *He announced to the guild, causing them to withdraw their legs without losing sight on the match below.*

Nathan: *He smiled at Luna, causing her to smile back.* "Don't be long, you'll miss out on the other matches."

Rachael: "And if you do, our matches start right after theirs."

Luna: "Yea, yea."

Destiny: "Yeup." *She purred at Destiny and hovered after Luna.*

Karol: (A few matches left and we finally get to fight!)

Season: "To be very honest-." *He stared at Teresa with an exhausted face.* "I had my doubts about winning against you."

Teresa: "Blast it!-" *She screamed with frustration and started to punch the crystal, causing loud thump-like noises to be heard.*

Rachael: (The sounds of her punches are crazy!)

Season: "Teresa-"

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She frowned, continuously punching the crystal around her waist.* "I am currently bound-"

Season: "Give it up, Teresa-"

Teresa: "Ougi-"

Madora: *She carefully inspected the crystal around Teresa.* (Although it has solidified, it's still growing, if it reaches her chest, it could-)

Teresa: *She gritted her teeth with emotion, pointing both hands to her abdomen.* "Bakana-"

Madora: "Teresa is incapacitated to move-"

Teresa: "No!-" *She screamed and quickly looked up towards the sound of Madora's voice.*

Madora: "Season defaults as the winner!" *She announced with an echoing voice, watching the arena revert back to normal.*

Teresa: *She sighed in a defeated manner, watching the crystal fade away with the scenery.* "How embarrassing." *She regained her composure and took a deep breath, causing her to relax.*

Season: *A revitalising wind blew across the arena, causing him to chuckle in a more casual manner.* "I think that was a really good match."

Teresa: ".. Indeed."

Season: "Although, I wasn't expecting you to get caught by that Rostical." *Images of Teresa punching the crystal flashed in his head.*

Teresa: *She silently nodded her head.* "I momentarily forgot you had used it, or, at least, I was not expecting the liquid to be ongoing."

Season: "Oh?"

Teresa: "Distracting me with that water-based Grand Rostical."

Season: "Oh-" *He smiled in appreciation, brushing dirt off his robes.* "Well, it was a good match."

Teresa: "Humph." *She smiled with respect.* "Good work, Caesar."

Season: *He smiled and nodded his head, placing the trident behind his back.* "You too-"

Teresa: "I will eventually see you in the waiting area-" *She didn't wait for Season's response as her image disappeared out of the arena.*

Madora: *She watched Season hobble out of the arena.* "Next is-"

Lance: *He excitedly ran into the arena and stared at the gate, smirking in a cocky manner.* (Dude, this is goin' to be awesome.)

Luna: *She casually walked into the arena and stared at Lance, stopping in the middle.* "Hey."

Lance: "Wat's up?"

Luna and Lance: "The sky." *They both laughed at each other.*

Madora: "Choose your scenery!"

Luna: "Ladies first?"

Lance: *He smirked, watching Luna's long white hair sway behind her.* "If you tell me how ya got that hair."

Luna: "I looked at your face and it scared the shit out of me, oh, and the colour, too."

Lance: "You're so funny-" *He rolled his eyes, watching the area blur around him.*

Luna: "Hmm?" *She looked around with a satisfying smirk, listening to the sounds of train tracks.* "Nice, I like it."

Lance: *He rocked to each side as he stared outside the train they stood in.* "Yea, had this mean idea when I slaughtered the bad guy."

*Lance pretended to punch someone in the face and leant back, cockily sniffing his nose.*

Luna: "Slaughtered? Nah, I bet you got smashed outside the window."

Lance: "Huh?" *Her words triggered a flashback, causing him to fold his arms.* "Pssht, wateva."

Madora: "Lance versus. Luna!-"

Chapter 21: Lance Versus. Luna

Madora: "Let the battle begin!"

Lance: *He clicked his fingers causing a stream of electricity to form itself into a sword.* "Heh-"
Luna: *She clicked her fingers causing a stream of electricity to form itself into a bow.* "Heh."

Lance: "Pssht-" *He bent his knees and jumped five seat rows towards Luna, raising the lightning sword.* "Harh!"

Luna: *She stepped back, raising the bow without a worry.* "Come at me-"

Lance: "Oh I will-" *He stepped into striking distance and slashed the sword down, striking Luna's bow.*

Luna: *She watched Lance's arm shake, causing her to smirk with confidence.* "Not bad-"

Lance: *He watched his lightning sword spark against her bow, causing him to grunt with frustration.* "Why isn't it-?"

Luna: "Hmph." *She chuckled as if she was enjoying Lance's struggle.*

Lance: "Huh?" *A small zapping light repelled his sword back, causing him to step back.* "How-?"

Luna: "I was an Elementalist first."

Lance: "Really?" *He spoke in amazement, quickly looking confused.* "But I wasn't-?"

Luna: *She ran forward, slicing each end of the bow at Lance.* "Too bad my power-ups don't revolve 'round you!"

Lance: *He started to walk back and swayed to each side as Luna violently swayed the lightning bow at him.* "You're slow-"

Luna: *She jumped forward and leant to the side, slicing across.* "Tssk-"

Lance: *He quickly stepped to the side and raised his sword, blocking Luna's strike.* "Hrr-" *He grunted, watching the lightning violently spark against each other.*

*Small strings of lightning flashed off their weapons and zapped through the nearby chairs, bursting several into flames.*

Luna: "Grr-" *She pushed forward, knocking Lance back.*

Lance: *He stumbled back and quickly raised the sword, readying himself for another attack.* (Damn, gettin' pushed back by my once emo little sister!-)

Luna: (Destiny, keep your eyes on him!) *She jumped forward and firmly held onto the bow, watching it stream in between her fingers.*

Destiny: (Yes!) *Her voice echoed in Luna's mind.*

Lance: "Hah!" *He swayed his sword in a defensive manner, blocking Luna's strikes.*

Luna: *She continued to jab each end of the bow at Lance, ignoring the glimmering light from metallic objects around her.* (My electricity is stronger, but he's quicker at movin' it-)

Lance: *Seriousness filled his face as he concentrated on blocking Luna's continuous strikes.* "Your weird lookin' sword is able to push mine back, but mine doesn't push yours back."

Destiny: (Does he think you use a sword?)

Luna: "You're an idiot-" *She hopped backwards and pulled the string.* "Dodge this-"

Lance: *He grunted with realisation.* (I am an idiot! It's a bow!-)

Luna: "Windstream Shot." *She released the lightning string, firing an arrow made of wind at Lance.*

Lance: *He looked shocked and flashstepped on top of a nearby seat, causing its hinges to snap.* (Crap-)

Nathan: *He watched the arrow blast through the train and out the back, causing distant shatters to echo.* (That's Luna! I know she'll win.) *He smirked to himself.*

Luna: *She glanced to her side and smirked while pulling the string back.* "Your stop!"

Lance: *He raised the sword and stared at Luna in confusion as light bounced off his face caused by the lightning.* "Aye? My stop-?"

Luna: "Seraphic Volt." *She shot an arrow of lightning at Lance, smashing him through the window behind him.*

Rachael: "Nice."

Lance: (Shit!-) *He grunted with a frown as shards of glass spiralled and swirled around him.* (This is just like my fight with Ridley-)

*Lance landed and tumbled across a grassy hill, quickly standing on his feet.*

Lance: (Damn-) *He frowned and stared at the train as his feet scraped back across the hill.*

Luna: *She jumped off the train and spread her legs, landing on another hill.* "Argh-"

*Luna rocked back and forth, trying to gather her balance.*

Lance: "Ha! You almost fell over!-"

Luna: "Seraphic Volt." *She ignored Lance and raised the bow, quickly firing arrows of lightning at him.* (He is goin' to totally underestimate me.)

Destiny: (But why? He's seen you fight outside the city.)

Luna: (I dunno, he's somehow really observant but not at the same time.) *She skilfully pulled and flicked the string, shooting more arrows at Lance.*

Destiny: (At least we know what he can do!)

Luna: *She watched small streak-like explosions burst along the ground behind Lance caused by her arrows.* (Damn right, Dest! I think the days of us underestimatin' people are over.)

Lance: *He ran to each side dodging the arrows.* "Why don't ya come a little closer?!"

Luna: "Seraphic Volt." *She frowned with an emotionless face, firing off another lightning arrow.*

Lance: *He dodged the last arrow, quickly observing the country-like environment around him.* "We're in the middle of Dee Highs and the city, why don't we go all-out? There're no obstacles here, aye."

Luna: "Seeking Streaming Bolts." *The size of her bow doubled in size and she pulled the string back.*

Lance: *He looked at Luna, standing on the side in a defensive manner.* (Despite what I'm seein', it doesn't feel like Luna is as strong as me-)

Luna: *She smirked and released the string, shooting blue missile-like beams of zigzagged bolts high into the air.* "Now-"

*Luna lowered the bow, causing it to return to its normal size.*

Luna: "Powers of the relaxing green, beat and skip through the winds, WIND'S PULSE"

Lance: *He raised the sword above him, watching the blue bolts circle like fish.* (Wat are they doin'-?)

*A ring of wind circled in front of Lance and burst, knocking him back.*

Lance: "Ah!-" *He fell to the ground as his nose started to bleed.*

Lezard: (Wowza! His nose just broke! All the beautiful lasses in the guild are much stronger than they look.)

Luna: *A yellow glyph shined under her feet.* "OK-"

Lance: *He stood up with a grunt and wiped the blood which touched his upper lip.* "I'm not afraid to smash ya face in!-"

Luna: "Spiralling lightning, instantaneously pierce, CRESCENT VOLT HOOK" *She clicked her fingers and a powerful blast of purple lightning instantly zapped across Lance.*

Lance: *He leant back and flashstepped several feet back, watching the lightning zap the air where his head was.* (Shit!)

Luna: *She raised her arm.* "Lightning pulse like veins, true power recharge and discharge and flow through the easiest current-"

*Lightning flashed like veins in the air above Lance, catching his attention.*

Luna: "LIGHTNING STRIKE" *She lowered her arm and a thick burst of lightning struck downwards.*

Lance: "Now's my chance-" *He squinted his eyes at the lightning and stepped back, flashstepping out of Luna's sight.*

Luna: "Huh?" *She looked startled and watched the lightning dissipate with growing confusion.* (Where did he go?)

Destiny: (Let me check for his Neuron signature!)

Rachael: (Observe your surroundings, Luna!) *She thought in frustration and formed a fist, causing her gloves to stretch.*

Destiny: (Below!)

Luna: *She looked down at the bottom of the hill and noticed Lance straightening his arm at her.* "So, I've heard a few things about you."

Lance: "Smear upon the skies, blue waves crashing down, LIGHTNING BLAST" *A stream of bright yellow lightning blasted towards Luna.* "Oh yea, wat?"

*One of the blue bolts in the air flashed down in front of Luna and blocked Lance's lightning.*

Lance: (Huh?) *He watched the yellow and blue lightning disappear in several violent flashes.* (It's like my Lightning Chain Blast..)

Luna: "They say you're brave, powerful, a protector, a leader, and even a role model. What a laugh!"

Lance: ".. W-Well, it ain't that funny."

Luna: "Oh, it is." *She grunted with a sigh.* "All you know is lightning 'n' thunder."

Lance: "Umm, so do you?!"

Luna: *She ran her hand through her silky looking white hair.* "Yea."

Destiny: (What're you trying to do?!)

Luna: (Piss him off.)

Lance: *He gritted his teeth and formed fists as red glyphic rings spiralled around his left wrist.* (I'll show you just thunder 'n' lightnin'!)

Luna: (Destiny, gimme a boost-) *She bent down and jumped high into the air.*

Lance: "Untouchable flames, splinter from the divine spirit, burning courage engrave my immense power, scorch thout foe-"

*The area darkened and black flames swirled around Lance, causing the air to warp around him.*

Destiny: (Luna! His Neuron power! I can't sense it!)

Luna: (Huh-?) *She looked down, gasping in shock.*

Lance: "PHOENIX BLASTER" *He waved his hand upwards, causing the swirl of black flames to screech.*

Luna: (Fire?! Since when could he-?!)

Lance "Go!" *He shouted and pointed at Luna, watching the flames take shape of a bird.*

Luna: "Destiny!"

Destiny: (Yeup!)

Luna and Destiny: "Hi-Owgee." *She shouted with an echoing voice, watching the black phoenix flap its wings towards her.*

Rachael: (It's too fast-)

Luna: "Mitochondria, feed on my Neurons! Electrons discharge, voltage self-induct and power me up. Together, we will stomp-" *She paused in mid-sentence.* "Shit-"

Lance: *He watched the phoenix hit Luna and an explosion of black flames pulsed across the air.* "Heh-"

Nathan: "Oh no!-" *He quickly stood up in fear, catching Karol's attention.*

Karol: "What's wrong, Nafan?"

Ginger: *She looked at Karol and sighed.* "Ey, K-Karol? Did you forget the limiter has been removed? With that strange Grand Remenistal he possesses, it is plausible-"

Nathan: *He looked into the air and noticed Luna smothered with flames.* "Th-There she is!-"

Karol: (It's plawsable.. Sometimes I forget how serious this is.)

Blake: (She got knocked up pretty high.)

Luna: *She fell towards the ground as black streams of smoke spiralled away from her.* (I've never seen him use that before-)

Lance: *He watched Luna plummet towards the ground with a fading smile.* (.. Maybe I shouldn't have used that-)

Destiny: (Luna! Manipulate the Astragons around you!)

Luna: *She focused with widening eyes, causing her plummeting speed to slow down.* "Tssk-"

Lance: (Huh? Am I trippin', or did she-?)

Luna: *She stared at the ground, slowly pulling the string to her bow and shot an arrow of wind into the ground.* "Yargh-"

*A pulse of wind pushed Luna slightly back, allowing her to land safely on the ground.*

Lance: (I do the same thing with my Thunder Boom-)

Luna: (He's not even worth it-) *She hunched forward, causing strands of white hair to fall in front of her face.*

Destiny: (Not worth what?)

Luna: (He's not even worth me using my Owgee or Hi-Owgeel! I will defeat him with mere attacks!) *She frowned, gritting her teeth in anger.*

Destiny: (We were just about to use our Hi-)

Luna: (Enough! That shithead is goin' down!)

Destiny: (Wasn't he meant to be the one to get angry?)

Lance: (Somethin' is different 'bout her, what is it?)

Luna: "Not worth it!"

Lance: "I know what it is." *He smirked, catching Luna's attention.*

Luna: "What?!"

Lance: "Unlike my epic character development, looks like you haven't changed at all."

Luna: "Character development?" *She spoke under her breath in confusion, trying to understand what he was talking about.* "Been hangin' 'round Lizard?"

Lance: "Wat about Lizard? You like pickin' on ya guild members-"

Luna: *She frowned and flicked her fingernail, cueing her lightning to violently spark around her hand.* "My guild means everythin' to me, shit nugget!"

Lance: "There's that annoyin' dumb stupid sister I've always known." *He looked up and waved his hand in front of his face as if he didn't care about Luna.*

Luna: "Grrr! Seraphic Volt." *She raised her lightning bow and pulled the string back, firing an electric green arrow.*

Lance: "Pssht." *He smirked and flashstepped several feet away.* "Another tantrum-?" *A flash of electricity struck past his face, burning the side of his cheek and ear.*

Luna: *She stood on her feet and inhaled deeply, pulling the string back.* "I won't miss next time!-"

Lance: "Wateva."

Luna: "Seraphic Volt Swarm." *She grunted and released the string, firing another four green electric arrows at him.*

Keeper: *She intensely watched the match from the spectator rows.* (She's impressive! Firing off multiple arrows with one flick of her bow, phrhrhr.) *She chuckled in thought, smirking at Luna's fighting capabilities.*

Lance: *He stepped to the side and flashsided a foot away, barely avoiding the arrows.* (What the? Why could I only flashstep-, that-, far-?) *His vision blurred and he stepped forward in fatigue.*

Blake: "What's happening?"

Lezard: "His Grand Remenistal, it just took a while for the loss of Neurons and Astragons to catch up to him."

Lance: *He covered one eye, panting in realisation.* (Millard's phoenix Rostickal-)

Luna: *She ran in a large circle around Lance, keeping her distance from him.* "Harh! Windstream Shot." *She pulled the string and fired off an arrow of wind effortlessly.*

Rachael: (Good battle strategy, Luna-)

Lance: "THUNDER BOOM" *He looked alert and punched forward, blocking the air-made arrow with a sound of thunder.* (It must've drained me-)

Luna: "Seraphic Volt Swarm." *She flicked the string, suddenly shooting eight green lightning arrows at Lance.*

Lance: (Damn!-) "LIGHTNING CHAIN BLAST" *He pushed forward, blasting eight streams of fluoro yellow lightning at Luna.*

Rachael: *She watched Lance's lightning fluidly swirl around Luna's arrows before exploding into pulses of static.* (His lightning homed in on the arrows and exploded? When did he know something like that?!)

Lance: *His legs buckled, causing Luna to gasp with opportunity.* (Crap-)

Luna: "Magnetic Storm Shot." *She violently pulled the string and fired off a purple arrow.* (This will catch him off guard.)

Lance: *He shook his head as his vision continued to blur.* "THUNDER BOOM" *He punched the purple arrow, causing it to explode into a purple static cloud.*

Luna: *She continued to run in a circle.* "Bolt Charge Shot."

*Luna suddenly stood on her toes and squinted one eye, aiming a materialising yellow arrow at Lance.*

Lance: *He shook his head with disorientation.* "..."

Ginger: *She stared at Lance with empathy.* (I know what he is feeling, that exhaustion, I have felt it many times in my past during Sakurai's training.)

Luna: "Harh!" *She fired the small yellow arrow, shooting it towards Lance at incredible speeds.*

Lance: *He ignored the purple static cloud and faced Luna with a loss of breath.* "THUNDER BOOM" *He punched the air in front of him and the arrow exploded into a blast of yellow cloud.*

Nathan: (That's the arrow with condensed Astragons-)

*A visible pulse rippled the air from the yellow cloud and hit Lance, exploding the grass around him.*

Lance: "Gah-" *The force violently pushed him back and he stumbled to the side, losing balance.*

Luna: "Sub Lunar Divider." *She elegantly pulled the string back and lifted one leg, facing the sky above her.* "Ha!" *She shouted with a frown, firing a blast of blue air into the sky.*

Lance: (Shit, come on, focus-) *He looked down, staring at his feet with double vision.*

Luna: *She jumped forward and continued to run around Lance, smirking to herself in thought.* (Thank you, Destiny.)

Destiny: (Why?)

Luna: (If you didn't shroud your Astragons around me, that fire.. It would've determined this match, aye.)

Destiny: (You're welcome..)

Luna: (But? Your tone.)

Destiny: (Your attitude, Luna. Don't get too cocky.)

Luna: (I know.)

Lezard: *He mumbled to himself in thought, noticing Lance's disorientation.* (Father monster was a Consultant, he had a personal limit of four Phoenix Blasters.)

Lance: (Man, is this the first time I used that Rostickal or somethin'? I'm so freakin' drained.)

Lezard: (Lance maybe powerful, but he used an advanced level of Grand Remenistal. It's surprising he hasn't passed out yet.)

Luna: *She stopped moving and pulled the string back as an arrow made of wind shined like the full moon.* "Lunar Gale."

Rachael: "Luna seems to be giving it her all."

Ginger: "Ey, Rachael? Perhaps that is just how things are with siblings."

Nathan: "Not quite. She hasn't used her any variations of her Ougi, or has she released Destiny."

Luna: "..." *She released the lightning string and the wind arrow pierced through the air, shooting straight through Lance's arm.*

Lance: "Argh!" *He yelled in pain and stumbled back into the purple static cloud, causing him to violently twitch in more pain.*

Luna: *She watched the purple static cloud puff away, leaving Lance disorientated.* (Perfect-)

Lance: "Gah-" *He frowned and looked at Luna, straightening his arm at her.* "LIGHTNING-"

*A massive waterfall-like pulse of blue air collapsed on top of Lance's arm, causing the distinctive sound of bone breaking to be heard.*

Lance: "Argh-?!" *He shouted in confusion, watching his arm instantly bruise to the attack.*

Karol: (That was Loona's Sub Lunar Divider?)

Lance: "That's it-" *He awkwardly stared at Luna and straightened his arm at her.* "Smear upon the skies, blue waves crashing down, LIGHTNING BLAST"

Luna: "Ya ready?" *She pulled the string back and focused.*

Lance: "Are you?"

Luna: *She pulled the string further back and smirked with anticipation.* "Lunar Shockwave."

Lance: "Hah!" *He pushed forward, blasting a stream of thick yellow lightning at Luna.*

Luna: "Hmph-" *She watched the lightning blast towards her, causing her to release the string.*

*Bursts of water-like eruptions of air blasted towards Lance and collided into his lightning, causing a low popping sound to echo.*

Blake: (Not bad-)

*The lightning mixed with the water-like air and exploded, causing chunks of the hill to burst into the sky.*

Luna: (I take back what I said, let's do this.) *She bent her knees and swayed her arms down, causing the lightning bow to spark away.*

Destiny: (Yeup.)

Luna: "Come on out!" *She clapped her hands and tightly held them together, frowning with all her focus.*

Lance: (My arm..) *He grunted in thought, trying to keep a fixated stare on Luna.* (What's she blabberin' about now-?)

Destiny: *She hovered out of a materialising purple glyph behind Luna.* "Yeup!"

Luna: "Sorry, bro." *She raised her arm, causing Destiny to swirl into silver liquid.*

Rachael: "Awesome work, Karol." *She watched the silver liquid form into a magnificent silver and black bow.*

Karol: "M-Me?"

Rachael: "If it wasn't for your Hi-Ougi integration, she wouldn't have been able to utilise her one like this-"

Luna and Destiny: "Hi-Owgee, Amperes Lightning Flare-"

Lance: *He took deep breaths and his vision started to repair itself.* "Right-"

*Two waves of silver wind crossed Lance, causing a sudden blast of vein-like lightning to erupt high into the air.*

Ginger: "Yoh!-" *She tilted her head up in amazement.* (The lightning shot into the clouds!)

Lance: "W-Wat was that?" *He coughed out blood and dropped to his knees, collapsing onto his face.*

Karol: "That was weally quick, like a flashstep."

Rachael: "It was almost instantaneous-"

Blake: "My eyes, it was much faster than a flashstep-"

Nathan: "A flashstrike?"

Blake: "Yea, bitch."

Luna: *She sighed in relief and lowered her arm, causing the silver and black bow to splatter into liquid.* "Ch'yeah."

Destiny: *She re-materialised in the air from a ball of silver liquid and shook her body, hovering above Luna.* "Yeup."

Madora: "It appears Lance is unable to battle, Luna wins!" *She announced, watching the area revert back into the arena.*

Lezard: "Lezard wasn't sure who would win that match."

Rachael: "I'm more impressed Lance was able to fight like that with bone literally sticking out of his arm."

Lance: *A revitalising wind restored his clothes and healed his wounds.* "Well-.."

*Lance groaned and stood up, brushing dirt off his legs.*

Lance: "I want a rematch."

Luna: *She walked towards Lance, raising an eyebrow in a curious manner.* "A rematch? Why?"

Destiny: (Asking for a rematch so soon?)

Lance: "'Cause I won't use that Grand Rostickal so early on in the battle."

Luna: *She glanced across the arena, then to the audience.* "Let's get off."

Lance: "Yea." *He nodded his head and smiled at Luna.* "Man, since when did you get so top-tier?"

Luna: "Pssht, always have been." *She cockily smirked and sniffed her nose.*

Destiny: "Yeup-eup." *She purred in agreement, causing Lance to roll his eyes with a chuckle.*

Madora: *She watched Luna and Lance casually walk out of the arena.* "Now, the final match before the intermission!"

*Madora's words caused the crowd to anxiously cheer in excitement.*

Karol: "F-Final match!" *He squeaked with excitement.*

Rachael: (This is it.) *She formed a fist, leaning forward with anticipation.*

Lezard: "Ooo, I'm so excited, I'm having puppies." *He sarcastically giggled, wiggling his bottom on the seat.*

Blake: "Say wha-?"

Nathan: *He discreetly looked at Lezard and Blake, rolling his eyes at them.* (I'm excited too, I just don't have to display it like that.)

Madora: "Our last combatants are!-"

PKMY: *She flashstepped into the arena.* "Heh-" (Since the first match started-)

*PKMY placed her hands on her waist and pulled forward, causing two swirls of sparks to scatter around her Ryukkus.*

PKMY: (This is the match I've been truly looking forward to.)

Teresa: *Her image appeared in the middle of the arena and she stared at PKMY.* "Hoh? Releasing your weapons already."

PKMY: "Don't play dumb, Terra-" *She quickly stopped in mid-sentence and looked at Teresa surprised.*

Teresa: "What is it?"

PKMY: "You're just as excited as I am." *She half smirked and spun the Ryukkus like a fan's blade.*

Teresa: "It was a worthless assumption on my part, believing I could hide that from you." *She smiled and raised her arm, reaching behind her back.*

Madora: "Choose your scenery!"

PKMY: "Do you have anything in mind?"

Teresa: *She raised the Pentarang in front of her face, ignoring the swirls of sparks which scattered around it.* "I believe this may be a quick and extravagant match. So somewhere with space."

PKMY: "Well-" *She grunted and watched the area blur, suddenly smelling the ocean in a cold breeze.* "How about this?"

Teresa: *She looked around with a satisfying nod.* "Where we fought the Consultant."

PKMY: "Yea." *She stood in the middle of the large vacant land, watching the grass sway in the strong wind.*

Lezard: *He stared at the battlefield, triggering flashbacks of healing the party members from Ridley.* (The Lost Land.)

Teresa: "It is acceptable."

PKMY: "Kool-"

Madora: "PKMY versus. Teresa!-"

Chapter 22: PKMY Versus. Teresa

Madora: "Let the battle begin!"

PKMY: "As you said, I'll make it quick."

Teresa: "Hoh?" *Her image disappeared.*

PKMY: "Cra-" *She quickly looked back in shock and flashstepped.*

Teresa: *Her image reappeared slicing the air when PKMY was.* "Humph-"

PKMY: *She flashstepped behind Teresa, jabbing both Ryukkus forward.* "Harh!"

*Two copies of Teresa split from the Ryukkus, causing the audience to awe.*

PKMY: "Wha-?" *She looked to each side in shock, unsure which one to strike.*

Teresa: *The copy on PKMY's right raised the Pentarang.* "Shattering Slice."

PKMY: (I felt the Ryukkus jab into something! Did she split on the millisecond-?)

Teresa: *The copy on PKMY's left raised her arms.* "Shattering bonds, with calm Astragons, and forceful Neurons, SERENITY SWIRL"

PKMY: *She quickly backflipped and spun the Ryukkus so the blades faced behind her.* "Mountain's might and power, ninety three flash strike, Emperor's Fury."

*PKMY punched towards each copy of Teresa, causing visible aura-like fists to smash both copies simultaneously.*

Teresa: *Her cheek had a slight graze mark as the copy on PKMY's right disappeared.* "Tcch-"

PKMY: (Gotcha-)

Teresa: *She noticed a wave of visible punches as PKMY continued to punch the air in front of her.* (Breaking my ability so soon, impressive-)

*Teresa stepped back and flashstepped out of the attack, causing the grass to pulse where she stood.*

PKMY: *She lowered her arms and closed her eyes, inhaling with concentration.* (You're good with sensing, Terra. But now I can read the flow of your tracks, too-)

*PKMY chuckled in thought and opened her eyes with a smile, frowning in determination.*

Nathan: (I can't believe PKMY closed her eyes when fighting someone like Teresa-)

PKMY: "Sonic Drilldriver." *She spun around while twirling the Ryukkus in each hand.* "Harh."

*PKMY leapt several steps like a ballerina and spun the Ryukkus to blinding speeds.*

Karol: (She moves her weapons like a fan's blayde-)

Teresa: *Her image appeared in the line of PKMY's attack.* "Tcch-" *She slashed the Pentarang across and it was instantly deflected back with rings of sparks.* "Inconceivable?!"

PKMY: "My weapon's speed now outmatches your strength-"

Teresa: *She looked shocked and stepped to the side, readying to flashstep.* "..."

PKMY: *She lunged forward and sparks splintered off the Pentarang.* "Heh."

Teresa: (Tcch! I can not flashstep with Amy's weapon-)

PKMY: *The invisible Ryukkus screeched like a saw on Teresa's Pentarang.* "Yahoo." *She smirked, taking several steps forward with confidence.*

Teresa: *She smirked and stepped back with every step PKMY stepped forward.* "Humph-"

*Teresa suddenly flicked the Pentarang up, knocking PKMY slightly back.*

PKMY: *She quickly adjusted her posture, taking several steps towards Teresa.* "..."

Teresa: "Hermph-" *She spun around, jabbing the Pentarang towards PKMY's face.*

PKMY: *She tilted her wrist and changed the angle of the Ryukkus, causing another saw-like screech to scratch the sides of the Pentarang.* "Whose weapon will break first?"

Teresa: "You spout such folly, it is a weapon of memories, it can not break." *She stepped back and twirled towards the ground.*

PKMY: "Wat are you-?"

Teresa: "Your weapon's speed is as strong as its weakness-" *She jumped forward with the twirling-like motion and slashed the Pentarang across, causing PKMY's arms to touch.*

PKMY: "Argh!" *She screamed in pain and let go of the Ryukkus, causing them to spiral into the air.* (My wrists!-)

*PKMY glanced at Teresa and quickly did the splits, avoiding two streams of the Pentarang.*

Karol: "What-?" *He paused in confusion.* "-Happened to her arms?"

Nathan: "Due to the speed that PKMY was spinning them, when Teresa hit her weapons-"

Ginger: "It essentially created a violent Rasticplash, which caused them to recoil in a perpendicular-like motion towards herself."

Karol: *He looked at Ginger slightly confused.* "Like when yooh hit a metal pole on a rock and the vibrations hurt your hands?"

Lezard: "Exactly right, little monster!"

Teresa: *The Pentarang withdrew itself.* (I have not been holding myself back.)

PKMY: *She remained on the ground and took a deep breath in thought.* (I'm nervous-)

Teresa: (No time to recollect yourself!-) *She ran forward at incredible speeds, instantly slicing the Pentarang across PKMY's face.* "...-"

PKMY: *She ignored the pain in her wrists and quickly rolled to the side, listening to the Pentarang whoosh over her head.* "Tssk-"

Teresa: *She leapt to the side and raised her leg, side kicking PKMY in the stomach.* "Hah-"

PKMY: "Oof-" *She grabbed Teresa's leg with both hands and front flipped on top of it, punching towards her face.* "Harh!-"

Teresa: *She let go of the Pentarang and waved her hand, slapping PKMY's fist away.* "Tcch-" *She flicked her leg to the side, causing PKMY to land on the ground.*

PKMY: *She jumped towards Teresa, kneeing her in the stomach.* "Yarh!-"

Teresa: *She leant forward and elbowed PKMY's knee to the side before punching her in the face.* "Direct-"

PKMY: *She backflipped several feet and suddenly jumped forward, kicking towards Teresa's head.* "Ha-"

Teresa: *Her image disappeared and reappeared above her Pentarang.* "Tcch-"

PKMY: *She watched her feet move through Teresa's fading image, causing her to gasp with widening eyes.* (Fast-)

Teresa: *She tapped her foot on the Pentarang and flicked it up off the ground, catching it in mid-air.* (I am not sure if it is her empathic abilities-) *She looked to the side, watching PKMY land on her knees.*

PKMY: *She ignored her bleeding nose and held her stomach, frowning in frustration.* (She hit me with the speed of her flashstep.)

Teresa: (But she is significantly better at reading the flow of my movements-) *She flashstepped in the air just above PKMY.* "Humph-" *She firmly held onto the Pentarang, jabbing forward at PKMY's head.*

PKMY: *She punched the ground to her side, causing her to slide the other way across the grass.* "Yahoo-" *She used the momentum to backflip and flashstep higher in the air behind Teresa.*

Teresa: *She landed on one foot and held the Pentarang by the middle, causing two metallic streams to extend over her.* "Hmph-"

PKMY: *She gasped and quickly jumped in mid-air as if she stood on the ground, barely avoiding the two metallic streams.* (Close-)

Rachael: *She stared at the metallic streams in an impressed manner, causing her to discreetly glance at Nathan.* (These weapons of memories are awesome.)

Teresa: "Hoh? A game of flashstepping?"

PKMY: "Why not? Icy swirls call down upon me, frigid skies grant me power, ICICLE EDGE"

Teresa: "In a game of speed, it is very unlikely you will succeed against me-" *She flashstepped in mid-air and suddenly kicked PKMY in the stomach.*

PKMY: *Her eyes widened in shock.* "Shit-" *She gasped under her breath, looking at Teresa's foot with a dropping jaw.*

Teresa: *She pulled her arm forward, revealing the Pentarang in its retracted state.* "It was a good match-"

*Teresa spoke with an emotionless face, ramming the Pentarang towards PKMY's stomach.*

PKMY: (No!-)

*A lance of ice violently fell on top of the Pentarang in between PKMY and Teresa.*

Teresa: *She watched the ice explode on top of her weapon, causing her to squint her eyes as a pulse of mist blew in her face.* "Such a reckless move-"

PKMY: "Heh." *She coughed and grabbed the end of the Pentarang.* "You might be faster-"

Ginger: (An Icicle Edge at such a close range, PKMY could have risked damaging herself-)

PKMY: "But how much flexible?" *She kicked her legs behind her, causing her body to curve.*

Teresa: *She watched PKMY's feet curve above the back of her head.* (What is she-?)

PKMY: *She kicked Teresa on the shoulder and spun around, adjusting her hands on the Pentarang.* "Hah!" *She kicked Teresa across the face, keeping her U-like shape.*

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She frowned and twitched her wrist, attempting to shatter the ice off her weapon.*

PKMY: *She straightened her body and tensed her legs, readying to kick Teresa on the head.* (Here's a critical!-)

Teresa: "Humph-" *She raised her arm, catching PKMY's foot in the palm of her hand.*

Rachael: (PKMY moves like a cheerleader with those yoga-like kicks-)

Blake: "Amy sure is flexible, hey." *He mumbled to himself.*

Lezard: "They're still fighting in the air and without wings!"

PKMY: (I'm not keen on this, but with Teresa, being reckless will be the only way to throw her off guard.)

Teresa: "Ophelia's Cutter."

PKMY: "Raging flames, fall down, snatching heat-" *She noticed the Pentarang lose its image, causing the ice to instantly shatter away.*

Teresa: "Now, time to end this-" *She tightened her grip on PKMY's foot, causing the boots to stretch.*

PKMY: "Tssk-" *She pushed herself up and jumped, kicking herself off Teresa and into the air.*

Teresa: "Humph-" *She looked up and flashstepped in front of PKMY in mid-air.*

Nathan: (She can't get away from Teresa.)

PKMY: "Tssk-" *She gritted her teeth and frowned at Teresa.* (I can't flashstep in the air like her! Jumping off Astral platforms is already hard for me to do as it is-)

Teresa: *She waved her blurred arm across PKMY's body.* "...-"

PKMY: (I can't complain! I've got to learn, this is the area where she excels in-) *Numerous cuts sliced across her body, due to the invisible Pentarang.*

Teresa: (My ability to vibrate my body and adding an additional step to flashstepping results in the creation of an image-like copy of myself-)

PKMY: "Kah-" *She silently coughed with a dropping jaw, watching blood string off her cheek.* "FLAMING WHEEL"

Teresa: (By using a similar process, I can vibrate my wrists to the extent where my weapon loses its image. Such a supposedly advanced technique is child's play to me-)

PKMY: *A ring of fire ignited and swirled in a large circle on the ground underneath her.* "Harh!" *A tornado-like swirl of fire erupted into the air around her.*

Teresa: (What-?!) *She watched the fire around PKMY engulf her invisible Pentarang and hand with widening eyes.* "Tcch!-"

*Teresa quickly flashstepped on the ground next to the fire, watching steam swirl around the Pentarang.*

Karol: *He noticed Teresa's hand in perfect condition.* "How? The fire engulfed her hand?"

Ginger: "She moved at a speed where the fire had no time to react to her presence."

Karol: "Oh, ohkay." *He nodded his head in understanding.*

PKMY: *She waved her hand, causing gaps to appear in the spiralling fire.* (There it is-) *She looked to the side and noticed the two Ryukkus flicker light caused by the fire around her.*

Teresa: (That Flaming Wheel.. How reckless! When did Amy start to fight like this?)

PKMY: (I need to get them!-) *She fell down and spiralled in the air, elegantly landing on the ground with bent knees.*

Teresa: "Shattering Slice." *She sliced the fire and the air shattered like glass, causing the flames to instantly swirl to nothing.*

PKMY: "Karh-" *She suddenly dropped to her side as a large deep cut formed across her ear.* (I wasn't expecting that-)

Teresa: "A direct hit-"

PKMY: "Grr-" *She stood on all fours and frowned at Teresa, flashstepping out of sight.*

Lezard: "Flaming fish-cakes, these battles just get better and better."

Teresa: "Humph-" *She lowered the Pentarang to her side and raised her left hand at the Ryukkus, which stuck up out of the ground.* "Here is the proper incantation I learnt from Pepper's fight-"

*Teresa mumbled to herself, glancing at her hand in a confident manner.*

Teresa: "Shattering bonds, my Radiatons explode and implode the power of light, SERENITY SWIRL"

Nathan: *He stared at Teresa, watching her hair and cape flap behind her straightened arm.* (She is really fast, I can't wait to fight her in our matches-)

Luna: *She shuffled down the rows with Cameron, catching the guild's attention.* "Have we missed anythin'?"

Rachael: "Besides possibly my favourite match? Yes?"

Luna: "Aha, damn."

Cameron: "I see."

Nathan: "How come you fought? Our matches don't start until after this."

Luna: "Dunno-" *She shrugged her shoulders and sat next to Nathan, causing him to smile.* "Wanted to smash his face in, sooner rather than later?"

Blake: *He smiled, watching Cameron sit down next to him.* "You did good, hey."

Cameron: *He tried to hide his smile.* "Much appreciated."

Blake: "Much appreciated? You're a loser fufufu." *He chuckled and focused his attention back to Teresa and PKMY.*

Teresa: (Despite PKMY's highly advanced attributes, in the end, she does not have Radiatons-) *A vortex of light spiralled through the air towards the vacant space around the Ryukkus.*

PKMY: *She flashstepped in between the Ryukkus, instantly grabbing the handles with each hand.* "Hmm?"

Karol: "How did she-?"

PKMY: *She noticed the area become bright, drawing her attention to the vortex of light which swirled into striking distance.* "Crap!-"

*PKMY quickly grabbed the handles and flashstepped at a faster speed than usual.*

Luna: *She watched several strands of grass cut and swirl into the area where PKMY stood.* "Was that faster than normal?"

Lezard: "Indeed it was, Loonzamotto."

Luna: "Aye?" *She shook her head, implying she wanted to know why.*

Lezard: "It's just adrenaline, you silly sausage, bwarharh."

Luna: (So adrenaline works with flashsteppin' too?)

Teresa: (I was hoping that technique hit her-) *She frowned in thought, watching the ground violently explode in the middle of small clusters of white light.*

PKMY: *She appeared in the distance facing Teresa, wiping blood off her cheeks and nose.* (I need to fight more reckless! I won't be able to stand a chance against her if I don't!) "Hi-Ougi."

Teresa: "Hoh?"

PKMY: "With the power of my magic, and the power of his summon, we command thee to bring forth your total destruction-"

Teresa: *She noticed the air fluctuate aurora colours around PKMY, causing her to step back in an alert-like manner.* (What move could she possibly be using?)

Cameron: (Another single Hi-Ougi?)

Teresa: (I would usually attack now, but due to her recent unpredictable attacks, it prevents me from freely striking her-)

PKMY: *She pointed up as aurora lights waved and swirled in the sky.* "SCELDRANT'S COMET"

*An enormous comet enveloped with aurora light plummeted from the sky, violently crashing on top of Teresa.*

Rachael: "A direct hit?"

*The ground violently rumbled as a massive sphere of dirt and grass exploded into the air around the impact.*

Ginger: "Ey, Rachael? Yes, it was, logically speaking." *She leant forward in suspense, listening to the crowd around her gasp in amazement.*

PKMY: *She sniffed blood, frowning with anticipation.* (Did that-?)

Teresa: *Her image appeared in the air, far away from the explosion.* (Singular strikes do not work against me-)

PKMY: "Tssk-" (I thought that got her!-)

Teresa: "Air Pentaraid." *She gripped the end of the Pentarang and started to twirl her body.*

PKMY: *She frowned at Teresa and spun one of the Ryukkus in her hand, throwing it into the air.* "Swift Storm."

*PKMY raised her arm and watched a brown glyph spiral around the Ryukku, causing it to stop in mid-air.*

PKMY: "Harh!" *A swarm of Ryukkus suddenly shot into the air towards Teresa.*

Teresa: "Humph." *A cluster of Pentarangs swirled in front, before raining down towards PKMY.*

*Loud metallic echoes rumbled through the air, as the Ryukkus and Pentarangs collided.*

Cameron: "Materialisation of such Azure Bursts.. This is a match of supreme skills."

Blake: "Now that's sexy." *He giggled, watching firework-like sparks flash with every collision.*

Karol: "It's pretty-"

Nathan: "Ahem."

Karol: "Arh, it's awesome." *He purposely spoke in a deep voice, causing Luna to roll her eyes with a smirk.*

Teresa: *She stopping twirling her body and floated in the air, watching the rare sight.* (I had not realised we possessed such a similar Azure Burst, or perhaps I forgot about that too-?)

PKMY: *She sidestepped as a copy of her Ryukku spiralled through the air and stabbed into the ground next to her.* (I've got no choice, I'm really nervous-)

*PKMY sighed while spinning the other Ryukku in front of her.*

PKMY: *She suddenly stabbed her hand, causing her eyebrow to twitch.* "Ougi."

Blake: "Shit's about to go down, bitches."

Lezard: "Woof?"

Cameron: "Why does she stab herself?"

Ginger: "For the blood.."

Nathan: "Karol?"

Karol: "Teckniques sometimes require a blood sacrifice."

Cameron: "I am listening."

Karol: "Uhm." *He looked down and nervously flared his nose as if he didn't know how to explain it.*

Ginger: "Think of it as an incantation or dance ritual."

Cameron: "Oh?"

Ginger: "It is a requirement for supreme abilities."

Cameron: "I see.."

Apollo: (Instead of saying an incantation, something like blood is needed?)

Cameron: (I will ask more in-depth once Battling Oxident is over.)

Apollo: (Sounds like a superb idea!)

PKMY: "Incantation Exploitation."

Teresa: *She stared at PKMY and noticed blood running down the Ryukku.* (Her Ougi?) "Tcch-" *She frowned and grabbed the Pentarang before flashstepping out of sight.*

PKMY: "METEOR SWARM" *She raised her arms, watching a massive red glyphic ring materialise high in the air.*

Ginger: *She looked up, observing the glyphic ring with widening eyes.* (That formula!-)

Teresa: *She flashstepped next to PKMY, firmly holding onto the Pentarang.* "Tcch-"

PKMY: (Next to me-?) *She stared at her reflection in the Pentarang with widening eyes.*

Teresa: "Harh." *She sliced the air across PKMY's neck.*

PKMY: *She spun around and quickly ducked under Teresa's strike.* "Garh-" *Her hair rapidly flapped back as she ignored the screeching sound of the Pentarang.*

Rachael: (That was close-)

PKMY: *She pointed the Ryukkus at Teresa and jumped towards her in a dive-like manner, kicking her leg to the side.* "Raging Swirling Strike." *She used the momentum of her kick, allowing her to skilfully spin her entire body.*

Teresa: *She quickly placed the Pentarang across her stomach, blocking PKMY's corkscrew-like attack.* (I believe we are reaching the climax of this battle-)

*A meteor plummeted into the ground behind Teresa, causing a massive explosion of bright red flames to scorch the area around it.*

Ginger: (Her Ougi even works on a Remenistal such as Meteor Swarm?!)

Teresa: *She frowned with gritted teeth, ignoring the scorching flames behind her.* "Flora Dasher."

PKMY: *She kicked her legs and spiralled several metres back, firmly landing on both feet.* "Double Smack."

*PKMY jumped forward and slashed across, watching sparks scatter in the direction of her attack.*

PKMY: "Wat-?" *She spoke under her breath.*

Teresa: *She watched the sparks splinter in between their weapons with a slight smirk.* "..."

Karol: "What happened?"

Luna: "She moved the boomerang at blinding speeds like Natalie."

PKMY: *She frowned at Teresa.* (Damn, you.)

Teresa: *Another meteor slammed into the ground, causing a rumble-like shockwave to make her step forward.* "Tcch-"

PKMY: *She smirked at her opportunity and suddenly slashed upwards, causing a stream of blood to instantly run down Teresa's eye.* "Hah-"

Blake: "She got her!-"

PKMY: *A bullet of condensed sand shot her in the leg, causing her to yell in pain.* "Argh-"

Rachael: "And also her."

Teresa: "Time to use my speed to the advantage-"

PKMY: *She frowned and sniffed in pain.* "METEOR SWARM, METEOR SWARM, METEOR SWARM, METEOR-"

Teresa: "What are you doing?! Despite the ability to skip the incantation, using that Rostical numerous-"

PKMY: *She ignored Teresa and jumped to each side on one foot, avoiding the shower of sand bullets.* "-SWARM"

Teresa: (Foolish girl.)

PKMY: (Shut up-)

*Meteors plummeted in all directions across the land, causing flares of bright explosions to burst the ground around them.*

Karol: "G-Gah-" *He covered his face due to the bright flames.*
Cameron: "Inconceivable!"

Lezard: (Jinkies! There's fire all around the girls!)

Ginger: (Her Meteor Swarm, its power is equivalent to my Grand Remenistal-)

PKMY: "METEOR SWARM"

Blake: (Another one-?!)

Ginger: "That level of power, it is illogical!" *She quickly stood up, catching the guild's attention.* "Please respond?!"

Lezard: "This.. Is a Consultant level battle."

Teresa: *She slightly squinted her eyes as walls of flames trapped her inside with PKMY.* (Foolish-)

PKMY: "GLACIA'S EDGE"

Teresa: *She jabbed the Pentarang forward shattering the erupting ice pillar in front.* "Magnanimity Decibel-"

PKMY: "ICICLE EDGE" *She grunted and swayed her arms down.*

Teresa: *Four flower-like glyphs drew themselves in front of her.* "Tcch-" *She quickly stepped back, barely avoiding the ice spear which jabbed into the ground.*

Luna: *She watched Teresa's glyphs disappear.* "That was a good way to stop her using her Azure Burst."

Ginger: "Surprisingly good observation." *She watched the ice spear explode along the ground, slowly sitting back down.*

PKMY: "GLACIA'S EDGE" *She punched up, blasting a pillar of ice towards Teresa.*

Teresa: "Typhoon's Pulse." *She leant back and jabbed her finger forward, smashing the ice pillar into two waves past her.*

PKMY: "AIR SWIRL"

Teresa: *She swayed to the side and kicked a visible wave of wind, listening to it whoosh around her leg.* "Such trivial-"

*Teresa suddenly gasped in pain, causing her to intensely stare at her knee.*

PKMY: (I can feel her pain.. The Rasticsplash of that Rostical shattered her shin-)

Teresa: "Magnanimity Decibel." *She pushed a barrage of blue petals from four flower-like glyphs which instantly materialised in front of her.*

PKMY: "Huh-?" *She screamed in pain as a wave of flower petals sliced past her shoulder.* "Argh!-"

Nathan: (That was a fast start-up to that Azure Burst-)

Teresa: *She awkwardly stepped forward, purposely not placing her body weight on her wounded leg.* "Tcch-" (It is impressive her shoulder did not slice off her body.)

Lezard: *He looked up, watching hundreds of lights flicker in the growing glyphic ring.* (This is just the start of it..)

PKMY: *She glanced at her shoulder, watching blood pour down her arm.* (The amount of Meteor Swarms I used, Teresa was right, it was foolish-)

*PKMY intensely stared at Teresa, anxiously forming a fist.*

PKMY: (But, hopefully, I beat her and the wind restores me before I even feel the negative effects.)

*PKMY smirked at her plan and leant forward, sprinting towards Teresa.*

Teresa: *She raised the Pentarang behind her and gracefully charged at PKMY.* "Humph-" *She ran into striking distance and a meteor crashed in between them.*

PKMY: "Kargh-" *An explosion knocked her into the air and a swirl of fire burnt one side of her hair.*
Teresa: *She spiralled through the air, releasing her grip on the Pentarang.* "Herh." *She wheezed and belly-flopped onto the ground.*

Nathan: "Whoa!" *He chuckled in amazement, watching the girls lay motionless on the ground.*

Madora: *She watched another swarm of meteors crash on the land, igniting more bright flames to scorch the battlefield.* (That level of force.. No normal person would be able to withstand such crushing power-)

Karol: *The sounds of the scorching flames caused him to lower his head in fear.* (Even the sounds of their fire is sckary.)

Blake: "Wicked-" *He stuck his tongue out in excitement, playing with his tongue bar.*

Luna: "That's it?" *She spoke with closure, readying herself to leave.* "Our matches, aye."

Madora: "It appears PKMY and Teresa are unable-"

Teresa: *She slowly kneeled up and panted as her hair covered her face.* "T-Tcch-"

PKMY: *She twitched her legs as she regained consciousness.* "Dammit-" *She grunted and stood up, swaying to each side with a loss of balance.*

Madora: (Oh dear?) *She looked surprised, watching their shadows flicker to each side, due to the swirling fire around them.*

Rachael: "Luna-" *She spoke under her breath, drawing Luna's attention back to the fight.* "Show them respect and watch until it's finished."

Luna: (But I thought-) "Wateva."

Teresa: *She looked over her shoulder and stood up straight.* "This is not tolerable."

PKMY: "Wat is?"

Teresa: "You, to be on equal footing with me as a fighter!" *She screamed and faced PKMY with anger.*

PKMY: *She looked shocked, ignoring pulses of incredibly hot wind as more meteors exploded behind her.* "W-Wat?" *She whispered to herself in confusion.*

Teresa: "I was number one. I strived to become the best I could. Being the ultimate fighter was one of the things I had over you."

PKMY: "D-Don't be stupid!" *She stepped forward and frowned.* "You've got so much more going for you than you might think!"

Teresa: "Tell me!-"

PKMY: "Leadership, serenity, knowledge-"

Teresa: *She straightened her arm to the side and clicked her finger, causing the Pentarang to spiral off the ground.* "Such tedious things are not worth mentioning-" *The Pentarang flew into her palm and she raised it next to her face.*

PKMY: "You've got mummy's light-"

Teresa: *She frowned, staring at PKMY with killing intent.* "Tcch-"

Karol: "I dhon't understand, what's happening?" *The guild unintentionally ignored him.*

Cameron: (I can relate, the sense of power being taken away from you. That strange type of jealousy will eventually go away.)

Apollo: (It is ironic that she is the one to experience it now, no?)

Cameron: (Indeed.) *He mumbled in thought, triggering flashbacks of Teresa's Ougi.*

Teresa: "So, I will show you, the second person to witness my Ougi."

PKMY: "Second person?" *She sounded confused, wiping sweat and blood off her face.* "Heaps of people have already seen it."

Teresa: "Hmph.." *She chuckled with an emotional smirk, causing PKMY to gasp with realisation.*

PKMY: "A-Another Ougi?"

Teresa: *She tightened her grip on the Pentarang, causing a blade to flick out of the end.* "Indeed. Prepare yourself, as I will take my speed to its highest potential!"

PKMY: *She raised her hands and gasped, noticing she had no weapon.* "Shit-"

*Teresa's image disappeared, causing PKMY to gasp in shock.*

Teresa: *Several fiery explosions in the distance moved in slow motion.* (Now!-)

*Teresa suddenly appeared in front of PKMY, blowing a wave of cold air in her face due to her speed.*

Rachael: (After being hit that close with a meteor, she can still move at such a level-)

Teresa: "Endure my speed-"

PKMY: *She stepped back in shock.* "Arh-?"

Teresa: *She flashstepped before PKMY could respond to her presence.* "Moving as fast as the wind-"

*Teresa slashed PKMY across the back of her head, causing a string of blood and hair to flick in the air.*

Blake: "Shit-" *He watched strands of red hair sway past PKMY, as he observed the fight with his dragon-like eyes.*

Cameron: "What is it?" *He stared at Teresa as the purple rings spiralled around his iris.*

Blake: "Even with these eyes, I'm having trouble keeping focus on Teresa, hey."

Cameron: "Indeed."

Blake: *He glanced at Nathan and chuckled in a condescending manner.* "Feel sorry for you bitches."

PKMY: *She spun around, forming a fist.* "Emperor's-? Where-?"

Teresa: *She jabbed the Pentarang in the back of PKMY's leg.* "As fast as sound-"

PKMY: *She twirled around, kicking the air where Teresa was.* "Wha-?"

Teresa: *She slashed PKMY on the forehead from the air.* "As fast as blinding movement-"

PKMY: *She looked up in shock.* "ICICLE-" *Teresa's image disappeared, causing her to lower her arm.*

Teresa: *She flashstepped behind PKMY and slashed downwards.* "As quick as reaction-" *She flashstepped to the side, slicing the Pentarang across PKMY's left wrist.*

Lezard: "Th-There're two copies?"

Luna: "Nath, this is like your Ougi, right?"

Nathan: "K-Kinda."

Luna: "Oi?"

Nathan: "She moves faster than me, way faster.."

Ginger: "Ey, Nate? You must give yourself more credit."

Teresa: *She appeared on the ground behind PKMY, slashing her ankle.* "As quick as Rostical-"

PKMY: "Double Sm-" *Teresa's image disappeared before she completely turned around.*

Teresa: *She flashstepped high into the air.* "As quick as Azure, blinding as light, agile as water-" *She sliced the air at blinding speeds, causing invisible air slices to slash PKMY across her arms and face.*

PKMY: "Urg-?!" *She crossed her arms above her head, ignoring the exploding ground around her.*

Cameron: (It seems PKMY has lost the match?)

Nathan: *He carefully watched Teresa.* (Despite her speed, her Ougi is actually very similar to mine, so, you aren't exactly wrong, Luna-)

Teresa: "Can-you-endure-such-momentum-?"

PKMY: (I can't feel these cuts, but I'm getting weak-) *Her left hand sliced off, causing her to gasp in terror.*

Luna: "When-?"

Nathan: "When Teresa slashed her wrist."

Teresa: *Her image appeared directly in front of PKMY.* "I think not-"

*Eight copies of Teresa appeared at every angle around PKMY, causing the audience to cheer in amazement.*

Teresa: "FLASHSTEPPING FLASHSTRIKE"

PKMY: *All copies of Teresa sliced in front, causing PKMY to cough out blood.* "Y-You're not the only one that created a technique-" *She gargled and coughed out more blood.*

Teresa: *She flashstepped in front of PKMY as the other copies vanished.* "Excuse me?"

*Teresa panted and dropped the Pentarang on the ground next to her.*

PKMY: "Flames consume with a swift might, burn the Astragons at my command, HEAT-CUTTER SHURIKEN" *Fire burst around her right hand and started to solidify, giving the appearance and illusion of a spinning shuriken.*

Ginger: (That fire looks like my shurikens!-)

Cameron: (That is what she used against that massive skeletal-like creature.)

PKMY: *She pushed forward and slammed the solid fire into Teresa's stomach.* "Gah-"

*A massive explosion knocked PKMY back into the air, scorching all of her colourless arm hair.*

Teresa: "Garh-" *The explosion blasted her back and she stumbled across the ground, coughing out blood.*

Luna: "Holy shit-" *She grunted under her breath, staring at the bright swirling flames.*

Destiny: (I find it interesting how we're able to distinguish the meteors' flames with the attack she just used.)

Teresa: *She struggled to lean up, causing her eyes to shine golden.* (I have to-) *She exhaled and became limp, rolling to the side unconscious.*

PKMY: (Can't hear-) *She fell face first on the ground and instantly fell unconscious.*

Blake: "Wat a way to end the battle!"

Rachael: "Yeah."

Madora: "I-It appears PKMY and Teresa are unable to battle! It's a draw!" *The crowd cheered as the area reverted back into the arena.*

Lezard: (Amazing. I believe we all did our best when we fought the Consultant, but none of us could go all-out like that without the risk of hurting someone.)

*A revitalising wind healed Teresa and PKMY's injuries, causing them to gasp into consciousness.*

PKMY: *She moaned and opened her eyes, placing both hands in front of her.* "H-Huh?" *She looked at her left hand in relief and pushed herself up.*

Cameron: *He watched PKMY awkwardly stand on her buckling legs.* (Despite being healed, standing up straight after an overwhelming fight, it is impressive-)

PKMY: "Teresa-" *She turned around and noticed Teresa walking up to her.* (She's unaffected-)

Teresa: "You fought well-" *She mumbled with respect and hugged PKMY, causing her to gasp.* "I believe I owe you an apology?" *Her tone sounded unsure.*

PKMY: *She smiled and hugged her, shaking her head.* "You're my big sister if I like it or not. I look up to you."

Teresa: *She smiled and stepped back.* "Indeed."

PKMY: *She sighed in a satisfying manner, glancing across the dirt.* "Let's get off this arena. Even I've grown tired of battles."

Teresa: "Indeed." *She raised her arm and clicked her fingers, causing the Pentarang to spiral into her hand.*

PKMY: *She concentrated on her hands and the Ryukkus materialised in the air in front of her.* "You never showed me that Ougi before, speaking of that, you never told me you had two."

Teresa: "Hoh? When did you know that solid fire type Rostical?"

PKMY: *She grabbed the Ryukkus and placed them behind her waist, causing them to disappear.* "Well, I admired your skills.."

Teresa: "Hoh?" *She looked at PKMY puzzled and stepped to the side, slowly walking towards the gate.*

PKMY: "You know, your Serenity Swirl."

Teresa: "Oh." *She continued to smile and brushed dirt off her chest, nodding her head in understanding.* (So she used the same formula in order to create another hybrid-based Rostical.)

Madora: *She watched PKMY and Teresa leave the arena, causing her to chuckle to herself.* (You must be proud, Tarlea.)

*Madora chuckled again and hobbled towards Season's chair.*

Madora: (Luckily we have the intermission, my legs are getting tired.)

*Teresa and PKMY walked into the waiting area and noticed the entire party waiting for them.*

Lezard: *He leant back in the seat, glancing to each side at his guild members.* "So, what are your thoughts on that match?"

Ginger: "It was enjoyable."

Rachael: "It was crazy." *She stood up, causing the entire guild to stand up.*
Luna: "It was insane." *She started to shuffle down the row.*

Nathan: "I prefer to participate in the fights themselves, rather than watch. But, it was overwhelming, even to watch."

Lezard: "Ooo, sensational reviews, everyone." *He giggled sarcastic-like.*

Madora: "Everyone, take this opportunity to rest and we'll begin the next set of matches momentarily." *She announced with an echoing voice, watching several people stand up and shuffle down the rows.*

Nathan: *He punched his hands in excitement.* (Now it's my turn to fight.)

Karol: (I'm excited, they finally allowed me to enter in a Battling Oxident, nee hee!) *He giggled to himself and followed Blake and Cameron down the stairs.*

----------

Lance: "Right, apparently there's like another set of matches comin' up."

Alicia: "So let's go."

Pepper: *She noticed the party cluttering the middle of the waiting area.* "I say, we should hurry."

Alicia: "Yep."

Season: "That was a splendid fight." *He spoke to PKMY and Teresa, as he started to walk out of the waiting area.*

Tyler: *He followed Season, enthusiastically nodding his head in agreement.* "Yeah, those meteor swarms looked really scary."

Holland: *He walked up to PKMY and kissed her.* "It was a good match."

PKMY: "Heh." *She smirked in a modest manner, causing Holland to kiss her again.*

Holland: "Freya kept barking with fear every time it was a close call."

PKMY: "Pfft, she should have nothing to worry about." *She spoke with a smirk, stepping out of the waiting area.*

Freya: (Growlith!)

PKMY: "Heh." *She chuckled as if she heard Freya and started to walk up the large stairs towards the spectator seats.*

Lance: "Well well well." *He grunted at Rachael and Luna, watching them walk past the party towards the waiting area.*

Rachael: "Lance, everyone." *She glanced at each party member in the eye, acknowledging their presence.*

Lance: "Time for you to give us some entertainment, aye." *He grunted with a competitive smirk.*

Luna: "Pssht, that wouldn't be hard."

Lance: "You're just upset 'cause I beat you."

Luna: "Bah, if there's a sudden hailstorm, I swear it needs to hit some intelligence in him, aye!"

*Ice blocks gently knocked on Lance and Luna's heads, causing them to quickly look up in shock.*

Lance: "Th-That's wat happens when you say stupid shit like that-"

Ginger: "Negative. That was me. The statement of knocking intelligence into you overwhelmed me and compelled me to act on illogical thinking." *She stared at the Lightens with an emotionless face, revealing two ice blocks remaining in her hand.*

Rachael: "Hehe, let's keep going."

Lance: *He looked at Luna, displeased.* "Your mate."

Luna: "Unfortunately." *She looked equally displeased.*

Nathan: *He smiled and shook Holland's hand.* "That piercing suits you well, my bro."

Holland: "Thank you."

Blake: "Some good fights, but I'm totes sure that our fights are gonna be super sexy." *He strutted down the stairs, purposely ignoring a possible response.*

Teresa: "Enough trivial conversations. Let us move towards the rows the guild previously occupied before they are taken." *Her stern voice caused her party to quickly and quietly follow.*

Lezard: "Ooo, my delicious spice? You should have asked Teresa for a fight! That would've been a feast for the eyes."

Ginger: "Ey, Lezard? I consume nutrients, minerals and carbohydrates through my mouth."

Luna: "Yea, Lizard, jeez." *She grunted, sarcastically rolling her eyes.*

Alicia: "G-Good luck." *She smiled to Rachael's guild, causing them to nod their heads in acknowledgement.*

Lezard: "Thankies." *He smiled and adjusted his hat, stepping into the waiting area.*

Lance: "Thankies? Pssht." *He mumbled and chuckled to himself as if he missed Lezard's sense of humour.*

Teresa: "Despite being healed, I am sure there is a consensus of us all feeling key signs of fatigue."

PKMY: (Once again she's right, I can feel it. We're all feeling tremendous fatigue.)

Lance: *He ignored Teresa and observed the spectator rows, stamping up each step like a child.* "The party climbed up the stairs past several rows filled with audience members."

Season: "Putting emphasis on these descriptions of yours now?"

Lance: "Aha, I gotta spice it up, or it'll get borin'!"

Season: "Hohoho."

Lance: "You, on the other hand, Santa, need to change that laugh of yours."

Tyler: *He looked at Teresa, nodding his head.* "Yeah, my shoulders hurt, and my legs ache and-"

Lance: "We get it, Tyler."

Tyler: "O-Oh.."

Lance: "Mister awesome shuffled down the vacant row Rachael and her squad of goons left behind-" *He chuckled, plunking himself on the seat.*

Season: "Hohoho, now it's our time to enjoy the fights?" *He smiled, waving Alicia to shuffle down first.*

Alicia: "Tee hee, yep." *She held her pendant in a feminine manner and sat down next to Lance, placing her hands on her lap.*

Lance: *He picked his nose in a carefree manner, watching the party sit down.* "Phew, I reckon that was by far the best Battling Oxident evarh!"

Tyler: "Yeah, I got to be in it."

Pepper: "I say, you did very good too, Tyler."

Tyler: *He giggled and adjusted the RPG bag's strap with modesty.* "I-I do try."

Season: *He chuckled and glanced down the row at the entire party.* "We all did well."

Holland: "So what are we waiting on?"

PKMY: "People to do their business."

Holland: "Huh?"

PKMY: "Like, eating, drinking, stretching their legs, come on, Holly. You're not that dumb."

Holland: "Haha, my bad."

Teresa: "Also, the allocated time regarding this intermission helps prepare the fighters for battle."

Season: *He nodded his head.* "Indeed, that's how it works."

PKMY: *She heard a voice, causing her to glance at Holland.* "Did you say something?"

Holland: "No?"

PKMY: "But I-..?"

Holland: "Was it Freya?"

PKMY: "I don't think so. It was a male's voice."

Holland: "It's probably just your head. You did have a big fight."

PKMY: "Yea.."

Lance: *He glanced at Alicia's hand and took a deep breath, nervously placing his hand on it.* "W-Well, these better be good matches, just sayin'."

Alicia: *She looked at Lance's hand and smiled, placing her fingers through his.* "I'm sure they will be."

PKMY: "I agree." *She looked down to the arena and leant on the side, using Holland as a pillow.*

Madora: *She waited patiently, noticing the rows slowly fill back up.* "Thank you all for waiting. We will begin the next set of matches!"

*The crowd cheered with excitement, causing the standing people to hasten their paces.*

----------

*Jester stood in a large cinema-like room, nodding his head in reassurance as he watched several villagers placed stage props around him.*

Jester: (Excellent.) *He faced and stared at a large stage, standing in front of rows of red seats.*

Lemon: "Jester, are you sure I get to play Lance and Luna?"

Jester: *He looked to the side and smiled.* "Of course! You helped me obtain the memories from the guild and their party."

Lemon: *He looked up to a pulsating glyph on the roof.* "Sounds like Battling Oxident is finishing."

Locki: *He walked down a cinema-like aisle, staring at Jester's back.* "How are the preparations?"

Jester: "Please finalise all the opening acts."

Lemon: "Of course! Everything is complete and everyone is where they're meant to be."

Jester: *He smiled in response and turned around, staring at Locki while nodding his head.* "Actually, it's completed."

Locki: "Completed? This is excellent news."

Jester: "All my actors are in place and are ready to go."

Locki: "Thy am pleased with the quick ordeals."

Jester: "Quick?" *He sounded confused.* "It has taken quite some time to plan this."

Locki: "Oh, excuse myself." *He slightly bowed in respect.*

Jester: "It is fine." *He took off his cone-shaped hat and smiled.*

Locki: "Thy will be informed when Battling Oxident has finished-"

Jester: *He looked up to the glyph.* (Wasn't he listening to the matches?)

Celest: *She appeared in a flash of white light, temporarily brightening up the poorly lit area.* "Phew-"

Locki: *He faced Celest with a welcoming smile.* "Thy was just about to talk about thou."

Celest: *She nodded her head and readied to talk, inspecting the area around her.* "Battling Oxident has finished."

Locki: "It took longer than I thought."

Celest: *She focused her attention on Locki, placing a hand on her waist.* "I lost count, but thy'd say there were over twenty matches in total."

Jester: "Whoa, it's an absolute delight to have you two take audience to our -"

Locki: "Inform Madora to initiate our plans."

Jester: "Oh.."
Celest: "Right away." *She stepped back and disappeared in a flash of white light.*

Locki: "Sorry to ignore thou, that wasn't my intentions."

Jester: *He nodded his head with a smile.* "I am quite pleased that you are doing this."

Locki: "Hmph." *He smirked, looking at Jester.* "It's our gift. Our thank you."

Jester: "Thank you?"

Locki: "If it weren't for their efforts, the mistress-" *He looked down.* "Pepper-" *He mumbled, looking back to Jester.* "Wouldn't be here."

----------

*Crowds of people walked out of Battling Oxident leaving it quiet and empty, causing floating glyphs to rotate up and down the spectator rows, sucking up all the remaining rubbish.*

Lance: *He glanced across the arena he stood in while stretching, smirking at the large group of party members.* "It's like a freakin' reunion."

Rachael: *She spoke in exhaustion, wiping sweat off her forehead.* "That last match was tough."

Lezard: "It was sensationalably spectacular." *He sarcastically wobbled his bottom.*

Blake: "That last match with the ice was super sexy!"

Karol: "Nee hee. Fank yooh!"

Alicia: "You certainly made me eat my words, Karol! Tee hee."

Rachael: "Yeah, thanks, Ty for making me look like a fool."

Tyler: "Haha. Practice what you preach?"

Blake: *He admired Ginger's new outfit.* "I hate to say, but you wear it wai better than me."

Ginger: "I have noticed a sudden response in strange and illogical behaviours."

Blake: "Oh? Like wat?"

Ginger: "Well-" *She pointed behind her, drawing Blake's attention to Tyler as he stared at Ginger with a bleeding nose.*

Blake: "Oi, guy? You have a nosebleed? Did ya not get healed up in the fight or somefing?"

Alicia: "We can help!"
Lezard: "Whitemages unite!"

Tyler: "I-I-" *He looked away, dabbing a handkerchief around his nose from his RPG bag.* "I'm fine, Alicia, Lezard."

Ginger: "After extensive observation, there appears to be an irritation with his nasal canal when I am in sight."

Blake: "Gross."

Luna: "Aha-" *She leant on Ginger's arm with an evil smirk.* "Boy, you've got a lot of anime to catch up on."

Ginger: "Please respond?"

Luna: "'Bout the nosebleedin'."

Ginger: "Yoh?"

Luna: "Somethin' somethin' sweaty heart, I'll fill you in later, aye."

Rachael: *She sighed and walked ahead.* "That final match was full on!"

Lance: "I admit, there were some kool battles."

Blake: "Nah, there were too many draws."

Rachael: *She smirked, keeping to herself.* (Only because we're equally as strong as each other.)

Season: *He hobbled up to Ginger.* "I was quite impressed with your fighting abilities."

Ginger: "As I were to you-"

Luna: "Wat do ya mean? You were all like-" *She started to motion like she was a robot.* "In my calculations, we will be logical and borin' and now we can't compute-"

Lance: "Pssht, look at you tryin' to be kool, aye."

Luna: "Warnin', warnin'-, douche detected!"

Lance: "Aye?!"

Pepper: "I say, I was surprised you were able to incorporate The Agoura Marbles in a match."

Nathan: "I honestly wasn't expecting such a hard fight."

Teresa: "I had completely underestimated this entire guild. I will make this clear, if we were to engage in combat again, I will fight initially at my full power."

Nathan: *He nodded his head while being slightly distracted as he glanced at Luna.* "I can't wait."

Lance: *He folded his arms, looking to the side.* "The old fart and the divine chick walked onto the arena." *He grunted, catching the party's attention.*

Cameron: (Divine Chick?)

Apollo: (He talks in a peculiar way, do you agree?)

Cameron: (Indeed.)

Luna: *She focused her attention to Madora.* "It's Ginger's sister."

Ginger: "Ey, dunce?"

Luna: "Wut-?"
Lezard: "Ooo-" *He giggled in excitement, quickly facing the direction Lance looked into.* "It's Madora and Celest."

Teresa: "Is there a problem?" *She stepped to the side, facing Madora in a curious manner.*

Lance: "Don't tell me we're gonna have more matches?"

Luna: "No way, I'm done."

Madora: *She confronted the party and guild with a strange smirk.* "I-"

Lance: "Dude, if you're gonna ask me out, just wanted to let you know, I'm with Alicia now-"

PKMY, Teresa, Season, Tyler, Rachael, Luna and Alicia: "Lance."
Luna: "Douche." *They all grunted with impatient tones.*

Lance: "Whoa-" *He turned around, facing the party with a shocked face.*

Lezard: "Not even Lezard could get a delicious response like that!"
Alicia: (Tee hee.)

Madora: "I believe there is a cinematic event held in all your honour."

Pepper: "Cinematic?"

Rachael: "Like a movie?"

Blake: "I don't get it, hey."

Karol: "Me neither."

PKMY: "Wat is it?" *She leant on her side and placed her hand on her waist.*

Ginger: "Please respond?"

Pepper: "Yeah?"

Holland: "Will there be food?" *He placed his hands over his head.*

Nathan: *He smirked and nodded his head, listening to his stomach growl.* "Food would be good."

Celest: "Refreshments will be provided."

Lance: "Well, I'm in."
Holland and Nathan: "Same."

Luna: "Sounds good."
Alicia: "Yep."

Lezard: "Yummy, Lezard can taste the excitement already."

Celest: "..." *She waited in the distance, listening to Madora converse with the party.*

Season: "Where and what is it?"

Madora: "In Silver Wind Island, and as Rachael said, a movie."

Rachael: "There's a movie in our honour?" *She mumbled under her breath, causing Luna to shrug her shoulders in response.*

Luna: "Beats me, aye."

Alicia: *She had a flashback of Lance taking her to the cinemas.* "I-I can't wait."

Pepper: *She looked at Madora, tilting her head to one side in curiosity.* "What are we waiting for, yeah?"

Madora: *She glanced at Celest, causing her to walk towards the party.* "Waiting for?"

Pepper: "I say, yes, what are we waiting for?"

Cameron: "..."

Madora: "Oh deary me, absolutely nothing." *She smiled and clapped her hands, causing a blast of aurora to blind the party.*

----------

*Lance, Alicia, Season, Teresa, PKMY, Holland, Tyler, Pepper, Rachael, Luna, Nathan, Karol, Ginger, Lezard, Blake and Cameron found themselves in the cinema-like area.*

Lezard: "Lezard thinks it would be easier for the writer and you, the readers, if we just say guild or Lance's party from now on, because no person wants to read nearly two sentences of names, wowza!"

Luna: "Wut?"

Lezard: "Nothing, Loonzamotto."

Luna: "Wateva, Lizard."

Lezard: "It's Lezard-"

Luna: "Wateva."
Lance: "Shut it."
PKMY: "Be quiet."
Blake: "Watevs."

Karol: *He stepped forward and fell onto his face.* "Argh-"

Nathan: "G-Get up-" *He mumbled and quickly helped Karol up before anyone noticed.*

Lance: "Where-?"

Locki: *He noticed the party, causing him to clap his hands, catching their attention.* "Ah, everyone!"

Rachael: "What's going on-?"

Blake: "We'd like some answers aye." *He folded his arms, hissing in an annoyed manner.*

Mio: (I agree. The lack of answers is quite bothersome.)

Locki: "This is your present." *He smiled, as Madora and Celest walked up to him.*

Season: "Present?"

Chapter 23: Food Play

Luna: "Our reward?" *She impatiently grunted, eagerly looking at Locki.*

Locki: "Please, everyone sit and make yourselves comfortable. Thy'll explain to you all what is happening." *His words caused the party to split in two.*

Lance: "Basically this looks like a high-end cinema, OK-?"

*PKMY, Teresa, Season and Holland sat in a row together, cueing the rest of the party to shuffle down another row.*

Lance: *He held Alicia's hand and shuffled down the row behind PKMY.* "It really does look like the movies." *He unintentionally whispered by habit.*

Pepper: "Moovys, yeah?" *She sat on a seat next to Alicia, glancing at Lance in a curious manner.*

Lance: "Gah, I'm not explainin' this again."

Alicia: "Tee hee, it's-"

Luna: *She looked to the right side.* "Call me a slave to routine, but I've always liked the right side of the cinema." *She sounded disappointed.*

Rachael: *She shrugged her shoulders.* "I don't really care as long as we all get seated together."

Luna: "Shit, Rach! It's packed. I dunno if we will, aye."

Lezard: "But, it's empty-"

Nathan: "That's the point." *He mumbled in his deep voice and followed Luna to the other side of the aisle, opposite to Lance's party.*

Lezard: "How delightful." *He spoke in wonder, observing the cinema-like curtains and ceiling.*

Nathan: *He looked over his shoulder, watching Ginger, Blake, Cameron and Karol sit in the row behind him.* "I don't have a clue what's happening."

Lance: *He looked at Locki who stood on the stage under a bright spotlight.* (Make this quick.) *He thought to himself in an impatient manner.*

Locki: "Thank you all, for your time." *He slowly walked across the stage, causing the spotlight to follow him.* "As Celest or Madora should have mentioned, refreshments will be supplied throughout the play."

Nathan: "Play? Do any of you know what's happening?" *He mumbled and looked at each guild member, watching them shake their heads in response.*

Locki: "We will have two plays, both following your adventures." *He smiled, motioning his arm across the rows the party sat in.*

Lezard: "Whose adventure?"

Locki: "The adventure with the Consultant, and the other following the yellow-eyed demon."

Luna: *She raised an eyebrow in confusion, causing her to glance at Nathan and Rachael.* "How could he possibly-?"

Teresa: "How could that be plausible? It could not be possible for you to know what happened on our.. Adventures."

Blake: "Yea?" *He hissed in agreement, folding his arms.*

Locki: "Through several means-"

PKMY: "Like?"

Locki: *He sighed with frustration as if he didn't want to explain it.* "Madora, The Astraseeker, through Celest's inspections, through memories. It was not hard to record what happened."

Lance: *He nodded his head.* "I'm satisfied with that."

Tyler: "But-?"

Lance: "Oi, stop askin' questions. It's like lettin' the teacher keepin' us from goin' home, aye."

Tyler: "But, I like school."

Lance: "Gah-" *He sighed, face palming at Tyler.*

Tyler: (Well, except for the bullies-)

Locki: "Continuing on." *He slowly walked across the stage.* "Each character will be played by the kind members of The Remenistic Village."

Pepper: (The village of Rostical Users?)

Jester: *He hobbled onto the stage and waved at the party.* "Hello, everyone."

Locki: *He watched Madora and Celest sit down in the front row, causing him to walk towards them.* "Jester will now explain himself."

*Locki spoke to the two parties in respect and jumped off the stage, causing his armour to rattle.*

Madora: "I'm excited for this play." *She smiled, watching Locki sit next to her.*

Jester: "So, for those who haven't met me, or Astragons forbid, even forgot me. My name is Jester."

Lezard: "Hi, Jester!" *He giggled in a sarcastic manner, waving his hand above his head.*

Lance: "Wat an idiot." *He grunted.*

PKMY: "I reckon." *She smiled at Lance, causing him to smile back at her.*

Jester: "For the first part of the play, we will be following, Lance, Teresa, PKMY-"

Season: "Our party, thank you."

PKMY: "Heh." *She chuckled at Season's respected but impatient tone.*

Jester: *He nodded his head.* "Each member of our village will play a character, and I will be the narrator."

Alicia: "Someone narrating our quest?" *She looked at Lance in confusion.*

Lance: "This could be kool." *He smirked as if he was unsure he liked the idea or not.*

Jester: "But before we start, I wanted to say, that whatever happens, we mean no offence."

Holland: "..."

Jester: "And you may leave at any time." *He paused in a serious manner, watching the party nod their heads in agreement.*

Lance: (Wat would offend us?)

Jester: "Alright!" *He sounded excited and happily hobbled towards a stool on the edge of the stage.* "Ahem."

*The lights around the stage shined slightly brighter, causing the party to become quiet.*

Lance: (This really does feel like a movie. Feels like the ads just finished.)

Jester: "I feel the intro doesn't relate, so I'll sum it up-" *His voice echoed, as the lights focused away from him and to the stage.*

Season: (His voice. Sounds like Battling Oxident, another use of my glyphs?)

Alicia: (The intro?)

Jester: "It was a scary night in The Swirling Marshes. Warriors ran from the Consultant, and bam!-" *His yell startled Karol, Lezard, Tyler and Alicia.* "She got 'em!"

Luna: *She tried not to laugh.* (She got 'em?)

Lance: (The Consultant got the warriors? I don't remember this-?)

Jester: "The scene changes to Dee Highs-"

?????: "So like, my name is Apple Lawyer, and you can't say-" *He looked up as if he forgot his lines.* "Well, whatever I said in the story. Okay, Lemon?"

Lemon: "Yea yea, like I'm hardcore!"

Apple: "Lemon! Try and take this seriously!"

Jester: "Apple had a slight sook at Lemon, you see, lemons are quite sour and apples are sweet." *He chuckled and winked at the audience.*

Lance: "Lemon?" *He noticed Season, Holland and Tyler slightly chuckle at him.* "Wait, is that meant to be me!?"

Lemon: "I'm Lemon Lighten, and I'm gettin' crazy shit nuggets."

PKMY: "Hehehe!" *She burst out into sudden laughter, causing Holland to quickly cover her mouth with a smirk.*

Lemon: "Dirty dirty, butt nuggets."

Luna: "Ahahahah!-" *She quickly covered her mouth.*

Lance: *He frowned and folded his arms.* "What the f-?"

Apple: "Oh goodness, how unacceptable." *He stamped his foot and pouted like a child, staring at Lance with a ridiculously obvious lazy eye.* "I better start work, so, you quickly go do your thing."

Lemon: "Yeeerh, no worries."

?????: *He stood behind the front counter and peeked through the glass cabinet, staring at Lemon in a jealous manner.* "I-I Trifle, want be Apple friend!"

Tyler: "Huh?"

Lance: "Aha." *He grinned at Tyler.*

Tyler: (Is that meant to be me? Why do I sound stupid-?)

Jester: "Skip scene!" *The stage warped inside a large tent with tables of strange artefacts.*

Season: (The stage transforms? Once again, similar to Battling Oxident's arena-)

Jester: "And now we find Lemon confronting Mandarin."

PKMY, Lance and Pepper: "Mandarin?"

Mandarin: "Oh, deary me-" *She croaked in excitement, smiling at Lemon.*

Lemon: "Nah, I don't go for oldies."

Mandarin: "But, I want you." *She moaned with lust and growled at Lemon, pretending to claw the air.*

Madora: "Oh deary me." *She laughed and looked at Celest and Locki, hiding her embarrassment.*

Lance: "Aha, knew she wanted me."

Mandarin: "Please, before I can no longer control my urges, take this plot device stone, so you can transport out of here."

Lemon: "Aye, say whaaart, oldie?" *He looked at her in disgust, face palming at her presence.*

Jester: "And Lemon hand faced with embarrassment."

Lance: (Hand faced?)

Mandarin: "I said, take it, it's for free." *She threw the stone in Lemon's hand and flicked her long black hair to the side, blowing glitter in his face.*

Lemon: "Ah, my eyes-?!" *He grunted and bent down, rubbing his eyes in pain.* "You stoopid-"

*Lemon looked up with squinted eyes, noticing she was gone.*

Lemon: "Oh?"

Jester: "Lemon takes a long walk-" *He smiled, watching the stage flash to Lemon walking down different streets.* "And after encountering Raisin Taylor and Mango Hambridge at the local library-"

Rachael: (Raisin Taylor and Mango Hambridge? Does he mean, me and Mel?)

Alicia: *She leant closer to Lance while keeping her attention to the stage.* "What is this?"

Lance: "These were the events leading up to me 'n' Ashton wakin' up in this world."

Alicia: "W-Wow." *She whispered in amazement and disbelief.*

Jester: "We skip scenes to the night of Sceldrant's Comet. All supervised by the best and amazing manager, Tummy."

*The stage warped with Apple, Raisin, Mango, Trifle, Lemon and Tummy on the roof of Fast Food Enterprise.*

Lemon: "Yo-" *He shouted at the party, catching their attention.* "You dirty butt nuggets, who all will be like my best friends after this adventure."

Lance: "Tssk-" *He raised an eyebrow and frowned.* "He's makin' me look like a fool."

PKMY: "I think he portrays your character very well."

Lance: "Funny."

Tummy: *She rolled her eyes at Lemon and bent forward, looking into a telescope at the night sky.* "Apple, please settle down Lemon."

Apple: "Of course, what are goody-goody guys for?" *He ran next to Lemon and folded his arms, staring into space with only one eye focused on him.* "What are you doing?"

Lemon: "Well-" *He rummaged through his bag and pulled out a glowing stone.* "I got this from an old mysterious lady who tried to hook up with me."

Madora: "..."

Trifle: *He held a red texture and jabbed dots on his face which acted as pimples.* "Y-You're such a loser, Lemon."

Lemon: "Dirty feral, butt nugget."

Apple: "Good gravy, Lemon!"

Trifle: "You word me hurts!" *He squealed in a dumb-like manner, pretending to scratch one of the obviously fake pimples on his face.*

Lemon: "Psssssssssht-" *He face palmed with annoyance.*

Jester: "Lemon hand faced!"

Lance: (Hand faced?)

Tyler: (I'd say I was insulted with the texture dots, but it's kinda true.. My acne was that bad.) *He awkwardly smiled to himself, feeling his smooth pimple-less face.*

Tummy: *She noticed the light of the stone in Lance's hand, light up the entire area.* "What's going on?"

Jester: "A flash of white light blinded the party, causing the area to swirl around them. Change scene!-"

*Jester glanced to the audience in a serious manner, catching their attention.*

Jester: "Chapter two." *He winked and focused his attention back to the stage.*

Lemon: *He moaned and slowly regained consciousness.* "A-Apple?"

Apple: "B-Be good, unacceptable, no, unacceptable-" *He mumbled in his sleep.*

Lemon: "Apple!"

Apple: *He gasped and woke up.* "Unaccept-. Oh, Lemon?" *He looked around puzzled.* "Where are we?"

Lemon: "How the flamin' butt nuggets would I know?"

Apple: *He stood up and brushed dirt off his pants.* "I don't think we're in Dee Highs anymore."

Lemon: "Really." *He gasped.* "Flamin' icy butt nuggets!-"

*A witch-like screech echoed in the distance, instantly catching Lemon and Apple's attention.*

Apple: "A screech? A cry for help?" *He pointed in front of him as he ran down the dirt path, pretending to be a super hero.*

Lemon: "Don't forget about your flyin' butt nugget sidekick."

Lance: "Wat is this shit-?"

Jester: "Whoa!" *He gasped towards the audience and watched a large spider-like Scoldrant, hunching over a woman with a large witch-like nose.* "Who will save her? Apple? Lemon?"

Witch-Nosed Woman: "Eeeeek."

Lemon: "Holy!-"

Apple: *He stared at the spider in shock.* "G-Good gravy!"

?????: "Hi, little monsters." *He hobbled into the area and smiled at the witch-nosed woman, holding a cone-shaped bowl on his head.*

Lezard: (Is that..?)

?????: "FLAMING WHEEL" *He quickly hobbled up to the Scoldrant and waved red glitter across it.*

Scoldrant: "Sk-k-k." *The man in a cheaply designed spider's costume, collapsed to the ground and twitched his legs in defeat.*

*Ginger and Season chuckled under their breath.*

Witch-Nosed Woman: "My hero!"

Apple: *He stamped his foot, pouting his lips.* "I-I was meant to be the hero-"

?????: "What is your name, little monster?"

Witch-Nosed Woman: "A-Avocado, yours?"

?????: "Milky." *He nodded his head and adjusted the cone-shaped bowl which acted as a hat.*

Lezard: *He smiled with slight sadness at the man playing Millard.* "Cute.." *He mumbled to himself.*

Apple: "Milky, Avocado, where are we?"

Milky: "Well, due to copyright purposes, we just call this, the land or continent."

Lemon: *He stared at Avocado with a goofy smile.* "Wow, Avocado is really pretty!"

Avocado: "W-What?"

Lemon: "I mean, I'm suppressing my desire for you, so I'll just pay you out and be mean until we get over our awkwardness and become awesome, like a super-duper couple 'n' butt nuggets." *He looked away and sniffed.*

PKMY: "Wut?"

Lance: "I. Don't. Know." *He spoke slowly in confusion.*

Tyler: (Haha.) *He smiled at Lemon while overhearing Lance and PKMY's conversation.*

Milky: "You little monsters shouldn't be in here, it's dangerous. You could drop your keys."

Apple: *He checked his pockets and sighed in relief, purposely jingling his keys.* "All good-"

Lemon: "So like, move the plot 'n' butt nuggets, just sayin'."

Avocado: "All of you, come to my village because that's what we apparently do when people save our lives."

Milky: "Only on one condition."

Avocado: "Of course?"

Milky: "If we go to Surpreon, to help find my keys."

Apple: "Halp? Sounds like the work of a goody-goody." *He smiled with a lazy eye.*

Lemon: "Right." *He grunted.*

Avocado: *She stared at Lemon.* "Lemon...."

Lemon: "Wat?"

Avocado: "I don't know, I'll just randomly say your name. Please get used to it."

Lemon: "Wateva, flyin' butt nuggets."

Avocado: "Lemon..."

Lemon: "Tssk." *He face palmed at Avocado.*

Jester: "Lemon hand faced!"

Milky: "Please excuse me. I have important business, like trying to find my keys. But hopefully, I'll see you lovely little monsters again." *He adjusted the bowl hat before walking away.*

Avocado: "But I thought we were going to help you?"

Milky: "You were until the writer of this play realised I left the party at this part of the story."

Avocado: "Oh-"

Jester: "Now after our heroes, Lemon, Apple and Avocado spend the night at the village. Avocado is granted permission to leave her village. After a desperate struggle against their first encounter with the warriors-" *He stopped and gasped at the audience.*

Lance: (This is so bad, who would enjoy this-?)

Lezard: "Ooo! What happens next?!" *He shouted in excitement, causing Lance to frown like a child.*

Jester: "Well, after a few scenes, our heroes finally continue their adventure to The Library, in the hope to find some answers!"

Lance: "The Library, pssht, that was borin'." *He muttered to Alicia.*

Lemon: "The Library? Blargher, this is borin', holy butt nuggets." *He grumbled to Apple, walking down a dirt road-like path.*

Alicia: *She looked at Lemon, then to Lance.* "Tee hee-"

Lance: "Shut it-"

Apple: *He suddenly gasped and stopped, glancing around with a lazy eye.* "Something-?"

Lemon: "Holy butt nuggets, wat's wrong, Apple-?"

Avocado: "L-L-L-Lemon.." *She whispered to herself.*

Apple: "My goody-too-shoe senses are tingling, someone's in trouble."

Avocado: "Senses?" *She quickly looked at Lemon.* "Lemon..." *She whispered under her breath.*

Apple: "Oh, no-" *He spoke in a casual manner, pulling out his keys.* "It was just my keys poking into my leg-"

*A strange yell echoed from within the bushes that surrounded the party.*

Apple: "Come, let's go, my sidekicks!" *He pointed in front of him and ran through the bushes, keeping his arm awkwardly straight.*

Lemon: *He rolled his eyes and sighed.* "Wat a child-"

Avocado: "Excuse me?"

Lemon: "Runnin' through the bush like that-" *He coughed in a mature manner and suddenly ran through the bushes with his arms swaying above his head.*

Avocado: "L-Lemon."

Apple: *He stood in front of a cave's entrance, listening to his surroundings.* "In here." *He waited for the party to catch up before running inside it.*

Lemon: "Tssk-" *He watched Apple run inside the cave in a frustrated manner.*

Avocado: "L-Lemon." *She whispered to herself.*

Jester: "Our heroes enter the scary cave, then bam!" *His loud voice startled Karol, Tyler and Alicia.* "Something happens."

Lance: *He leant forward, grunting to Holland.* "This is where we meet you I think."

Holland: "Oh?" *He looked intrigued with a slight smile.*

Apple: "W-Who is here?" *He ran into a sandy clearing surrounded by torches which lit up the area.*

Lemon: *The wall exploded and he watched a man run out of it.* "Who are you?"

Man: "No time! Quickly! The Guardian!" *He ran past the party and out of the cave.*

Holland: (Haha, now I remember, that's me.)

Freya: (Oh! I remember too!) *Her voice echoed in Holland's mind.*

Jester: *He intensely watched the party run through the cave.* "Come on, you can do it! Run, run, run!-"

*Jester stopped and glanced at the audience, causing him to cough in a professional manner.*

Jester: "Don't worry, our heroes safely made it outside."

Apple: "Good gravy-"

Man: "Gravy? Yumm." *He dribbled and moaned with pleasure.*

Lance: "Is he dribblin'?"

Holland: "Ha ha."

Avocado: "S-So-" *Before she spoke to the man she quickly looked at Lemon.* "L-Lemon." *She whispered his name and quickly glanced back to the man.* "S-So, what were you doing in there-?"

Lemon: "And what's ya name?"

Man: "People call me Hungry." *He spoke with an accent, causing Lance to laugh through his lips.*

Lance: "Aha, nice accent, Holland."

Holland: "Haha, I don't even know where that's from."

Apple: "Well, hungry. I'm apple, she's Avocado, and-"

Lemon: "Lemon." *He sniffed and looked into the sky with confidence.*

Hungry: "Oh, and don't forget my trusty companion-"

*A black dog-like Scoldrant ran out of the cave, catching Hungry's attention.*

Apple: *He pointed at the Scoldrant in shock.* "Good gravy!"

Hungry: "Good gravy? Yumm." *He dribbled and moaned with pleasure.*

Lemon: "Worms much?" *He face palmed.*

Jester: "He hand faced-"

Lance: "It's face palm!-" *He frowned, shouting out from the audience.*

Jester: "Shhh!" *He placed his finger over his mouth and focused his attention back to the characters.* "So, Avocado stared at Frey-" *He coughed, quickly correcting himself.*

Holland: (Haha, I really like this.)

Jester: "So, Avocado stared at the black Scoldrant in fear, before our friend Hungry introduces her."

Hungry: "Arh, don't worry, she won't bite."

Apple: "Oh?"

Hungry: "Her name is Fish-Fingers."

Fish-Fingers: "A woof." *She spoke in a deep man's voice.*

Holland: *He chuckled at himself.* (This is hilarious.)

Hungry: "It was great seeing you people. I got to go now with Fish-Fingers."

Fish-Fingers: "A woof."

Lemon: "Laters!"

Apple: *He stamped forward and smirked with a lazy eye.* "Come! Our faces are needed for more good!"

Tyler: "Our faces?" *He mumbled and smirked in confusion.*

Apple: "Heroes, away!" *He straightened his arm and ran into the distance, through the bushes.*

Avocado: "L-Lemon." *She whispered and stared at him with an emotionless face, before suddenly chasing after Apple.*

Alicia: "Tee hee." *She giggled with slight embarrassment and looked to her side at Lance.* "Do I really do that?"

Lance: "Aha yea. I've caught you sayin' my name a lot."

Alicia: "O-Oh."

Lance: "Didn't I pay you out about it before-?"

Jester: "Shhh." *He grumbled to the party.*

Pepper: "I say, why tell us to be quiet-?"

Jester: "The writer's favourite character is coming up in this next scene."

Teresa: "Hoh?"

Jester: "So, after an intense workout up the stairs to The Library, our heroes find themselves spying on their first captain encounter."

Apple: "I don't know what to do?" *He glanced at the party with a frightened expression on his face.* "Any thoughts?"

Lemon: "Butt nuggets?"

Avocado: "Lemon?"

Apple: "I agree with Avocado, we should wait out a little while longer-"

PKMY: "Hehe, she didn't say anything."

Season: "Indeed." *He smiled with PKMY, as they stared at Avocado.*

Lemon: "Nah, I'll get 'em-"

Woman: *A woman concealed in robes leapt in front of the party.* "Shh-" *Her sudden entry caused the party to jump back in shock, loudly knocking several books on to the ground.*

Warrior: "C-Captain?" *He watched the party awkwardly and obviously hide behind a single bookshelf.*

Captain: *She stared at Avocado and Lemon's bottom, which obviously poked out from the sides of the shelving.* "There is no one there, I'll meet you at the next village."

Warrior: "But-"

Captain: "I am Tinky Three!"

Warrior: "Yes."

Tinky Three: "Don't make me wait, I'll go get some tax!" *She grunted and flashstepped out of the area.*

Jester: "Wasn't that scary everyone?" *He shivered in a sarcastic manner, glancing at the audience in shock.*

Luna: "Tinky Three?" *She gave Rachael and Nathan a strange look, causing them to chuckle.*

PKMY: (He's way to overenthusiastic.)

Holland: (Haha, I'm getting into it.)

Jester: "So now-" *He watched the party step outside, cueing him to speak.* "Our heroes have left The Library with this mysterious woman in robes."

Lemon: "So, who are ya?"

Woman: "People call me, Taco." *She stared at the party and suddenly stood on one leg.*

Teresa: "Hoh? I do not recall standing in such a tedious and awkward posture-"

Jester: "Sh-Sh-Shhh."

Avocado: "You talk so interesting."

Taco: "Perhaps it is an unusual and inspiring way of misinterpreting the way one is able to speech."

Lemon: "Wha-?"

Apple: "I agree, you're so smart, Taco."

Taco: "Please, it is-" *She clapped her hands and pulled the same pose.* "Taco."

Apple: "Got it, Taco." *He chuckled.*

Teresa: (This Taco. She made utterly no sense with that previous sentence structure and incorrect choice of words?)

Lemon: "Right, enough talkin'-" *He stepped forward and slipped, rolling down the slope.*

Avocado: "No, he's going to die! Lemon!" *She screamed at Lemon, who rolled down the three-foot slope.* "Lemon!" *She yelled out again, causing the audience to chuckle.*

Alicia: *Her face slightly turned red.* "U-Umm-" *Lance wrapped his arm around her, causing her to smile.*

Apple: "Look!" *He pointed to the small village with a lazy eye.* "Halp is needed!"

Lemon: "But that chick was like, teleportin' 'n' stuff. She could fire butt nugget lasers or somethin'?"

Lance: (Butt nugget lasers..? I like it.) *He smirked to himself.*

Apple: "Fighting is unacceptable, unacceptable."

Lemon: "We got it-"

Apple: "Un-accept-abool!"

Avocado: *She stared at Lemon with an awkward smile.* "L-Lemon-"

Taco: "I am the great, majestic and beautiful-" *She clapped her hands.* "The Taco."

Rachael: "Hehe, their party seems really-"

Luna: "Idiotic."

Blake: "Fufufu, I know hey."

Nathan: "Haha."

Karol: "Nee hee, they are kinda different."

Ginger: "Ey, retinue, I concur. Their behaviour is quite illogical, please respond."

Rachael: (Coming from us it feels like double standards, hehe.)

Lemon: *He brushed dirt off his clothes and glanced around.* "Oh looky here, a sword neatly and conveniently placed for me to grab it!" *He quickly picked it up and ran into the village.*

Avocado: *She awkwardly played with her witch-like nose, looking up to Taco.* "C-Can you fight?"

Taco: "Taco does not fight-" *She clapped her hands and stood in the pose.* "I am a researcher, nothing more, nothing less."

Teresa: "Hoh?" *She elegantly brushed her hair out of her face.* "This poor imposter of me even uses weak posture and passive voice misuse."

Tinky Three: "Now, I'm being mean because I'm powerful, rawr!" *She grumbled at the scared villagers.*

*Taco, Apple, Lemon and Avocado hid behind a crate and stealthily observed Tinky Three's behaviour.*

Lemon: "We should get her!" *He whispered, slamming his fist into his palm.*

Apple: "Shh!-"

Tinky Three: "You there, in hiding!" *She pointed at the small crate the four party members crouched behind and quickly pointed to another stack of crates, causing a small boy to walk out.*

Apple: "Phew, that was close."

Taco: "Perhaps it was this excellent hiding spot?"

Lemon: "I rekon."

*Several frightened villagers stared at the party's bottom which poked out from behind the single crate.*

Apple: "I've got a plan!"

Taco: "Taco does too." *She whispered to the party, causing them to nod their heads.*

Tinky Three: "I'm using you as a pet or something, can't really remember my line." *She grunted at the little boy.*

Apple: *He ran from behind the crate and ran towards Tinky Three.* "Unacceptable!"

Tinky Three: "Hmm?" *She raised her arm and an inflatable plastic mallet popped into her hand.*

Apple: "I'm acceptable my way." *He sang and waved his bottom, causing Tinky Three to stare at him in confusion.*

Lemon: "Aha! Let me shoutout revealing my sneak attack!" *He hopped off a nearby roof and slashed the sword downwards, causing the pendant around Tinky Three's neck to fling into the air.*

Tinky Three: "Harh!" *She hit Lemon with the mallet, causing a duck quack noise to come from the mallet.*

Lance: (Aha, a duck? What the-?)

Tinky Three: "Harh!" *She pushed forward and blasted Lemon back through a small house and into a tree.*

Jester: "Awesome special effects!"

Avocado: "ICICLE EDGE" *Her pendant shined blue and it suddenly popped open, revealing a hidden compartment.* "Harh!" *She threw several ice cubes at Tinky Three.*

Tinky Three: *The ice cubes touched her, causing her to scream in immense pain.* "No!"

Jester: "Tinky Three collapsed onto the ground and died."

Lance: "Has this been asked yet, but why did ya need the pendant to use Rostickal?"

Alicia: *She looked down, shaking her head.* "I don't know. I don't need it now to use it though."

Teresa: "Allow me to interject, after observing Alicia's Neuron capacity, it appeared that without proper guidance, the Rosterology item served as training wheels."

PKMY: "That isn't unheard of. Once her capacity started increasing, the need for her to rely on the pendant became redundant, right?"

Teresa: "Correct-"

Jester: "Shh!" *He growled at the audience, focusing everyone's attention back to the stage.* "Taco gathered the party members under Avocado's instructions."

Taco: "Why was it a necessity to gather them?"

Avocado: "I-I can heal them-" *She held the pendant with both hands and flicked a switch, causing it to shine like a flashlight.* "HEALING RINGS"

*Avocado hovered over Apple and Lemon and pointed her pendant at them, flicking the switch on and off.*

Lezard: *He stared at Avocado's flashlight-like pendant.* "Bwarharharharh." *He wiped his eyes with laughter.* (The power of light, using a flashlight. I don't know why, but I found that hilarious.)

Blake: "Do you need a glass of water or somefing? I'm trying to watch this play, hey."

Lezard: "Oh, beg my forgiveness, Blakey-boy." *He spoke in a sarcastic manner, causing Blake to roll his eyes.*

Apple: "Ah, I feel healed?"

Lemon: "Me too?"

Taco: "This woman surprises Taco!?" *She glanced at Avocado in shock.*

Jester: "After all this excitement, our heroes go on a long adventure to their next destination, Surpreon. Avocado gives the viewers some history, but that's boring." *He shook his head with a dissatisfied face.*

Alicia: "Huh?"

Holland: "Haha." *He covered his mouth and looked behind him to Alicia.* "Sorry."

Alicia: "Th-That's okay-"

Jester: "And now, our heroes are at Surpreon!" *He clapped his hands in excitement, watching Taco, Avocado, Apple and Lemon enter the city.*

Taco: "We must see the ruler!"

Lemon: "This will be lame."

Jester: "Lame indeed, Lemon. Skip to the part where we confront the ruler of Surpreon!"

*Taco, Lemon, Apple and Avocado bowed down in front of the ruler, who sat in a royal-like chair.*

Ruler: "I am Sausage."

Season: *He chuckled and adjusted his hands on the arms of the chair.* "Sausage, I see."

Sausage: "You all should know, Battling Oxident is coming up. So that is all." *He clapped his hands and looked away.*

Jester: "Oh, I almost forgot, Apple and Lemon were shocked when they saw Trifle in the city."

Lance: *He smiled to himself.* (I was shocked when I saw Tyler for the first time, I actually felt a little relieved in a sense-)

Jester: "So how about we go to the scene with Trifle?" *He glanced at the stage and giggled to himself in excitement.*

Trifle: "What's Battling Oxident? Shouldn't Taco and Avocado already know?"

Avocado: "Lemon.." *She quickly whispered at Lemon, causing Rachael's guild to silently stare at her in confusion.*

Taco: "Of course, Taco knows." *She quickly stood in the pose and clapped her hands.* "But the viewers don't."

Trifle: "Oh!" *He nodded his head.* "Battling Oxident is a food eating contest, whoever eats the most twinkies wins the battle."

Lemon: "Sounds easy enough."

Season: "Twinkies?"
PKMY: "Twinkies?"

Tyler: "Ha ha." *He shook his head with a smile.*

Trifle: "Now, you should all rest up-" *He watched Taco, Avocado, Apple and Lemon walk away.* "Oh, and Avocado and Apple, please take a stroll outside."

Apple: "Why?"

Trifle: "For plot purposes."

Apple: "Oh sure-"

Avocado: "L-Lemon."

Taco: "Hoh? You confuse Taco." *She gave Avocado a strange look, watching them walk out of the research facility.*

Jester: "So, our heroes stay at the inn and night falls. As Trifle suggested, Avocado and Apple take a stroll outside Surpreon for plot reasons."

?????: "You!" *She grunted in anger.*

Apple: "Oh good gravy! Who are you?!"

Avocado: "L-Lemon." *She gasped to herself in shock.*

?????: "I am Tinky Two! How dare you hurt my sister!"

Jester: "Cue battle theme!" *He shouted, causing a generic battle them to play in the background.*

Apple: "Unacceptable!" *He ran towards Tinky Two, forming fists in determination.* "Un-accept-abool!"

Tinky Two: "Harh!" *She kicked Apple in the stomach, causing a duck's quack to echo.*

Apple: "You'll have to do more than that to take down a hero!-" *He looked up in pain, staring at Tinky Two with a lazy eye.*

Tinky Two: "What eye do I look at?! Harh!" *She pushed forward and blasted Apple across the ground.*

Apple: "Argh-" *He slammed into the wall of Surpreon and fell unconscious.* "Unaccept-"

Avocado: "N-No-" *She stepped back in shock.* "ICICLE EDGE" *She reached into the pendant's compartment and quickly threw ice cubes at Tinky Two.*

Tinky Two: *The ice cubes touched her feet, causing her to fall to the ground motionless.* "N-No-"

Avocado: "I feel weak-" *She looked at the compartment and noticed it was empty.* "I ran out of Neurons-" *Her eyes rolled back and she collapsed to the ground.*

Jester: "Frightening, wasn't it?!" *He glanced at the audience in fear, quickly looking back to the stage.* "So after a few struggles, Apple decides to become stronger, so he asks Taco for help."

Lance: (So, that's what made Ash train.)

Teresa: (I remember his emotional face, and I was filled with confusion and curiosity. So, I agreed to take him to PKMY with me-)

Jester: "But our other heroes weren't forgotten. Sausage gave Lemon and Avocado a mission to find Milky!"

Pepper: "I'm confused with all these names, yeah?"

Alicia: "Season asked Lance and I to go find Millard while we waited for Ashton to come back."

Pepper: "Thank you." *She smiled in understanding, focusing back to the stage.*

Karol: (This is weally interesting-)

Jester: "Skip to next scene!"

*Taco and Apple found themselves in The Great High Plains, catching PKMY's attention.*

PKMY: (This is where I train Ashton-) *She smirked with anticipation and excitement.*

Taco: "And here is your instructor-" *She watched a large bulky man stagger up to Apple.*

Apple: "W-Who are you?"

Man/Woman: "I am Pudding, and I'll be teaching you some nifty Rostical tricks."

Apple: "A pleasure to meet you, Pudding."

Pudding: "And so you should." *She/He snorted and spat out spit to her/his side.*

PKMY: *Her mouth dropped in shock.* "W-Why is there a man dressed in my clothes?"

Lance: "Ahaha." *He pointed at PKMY like a child and laughed.*

PKMY: *She turned around and frowned.* "Want me to smash your face in!?"

Teresa: "Do you two have to bicker everywhere we travel?" *She spoke sternly and with authority, causing Lance and PKMY to stop.*

Jester: "So after an intense training session with Pudding, we skip scenes to Avocado and Lemon's story."

*Avocado and Lemon ran through a forest and were suddenly confronted by a large teddy bear.*

Avocado: "O-Oh no, a Scoldrant!"

Lemon: "Blast it." *He grunted and looked worried.*

Avocado: "L-Lemon.."

?????: *A woman holding a large inflatable mallet ran past Lemon and Avocado and hit the teddy bear, causing it to fall over.* "I say, a lot of things." *She spiralled in the air and landed in front of Lemon and Avocado.*

Avocado: "W-Who are you?"

Woman: "I am Pork."

Pepper: "Hey, that's me, yeah?" *She smiled in excitement, glancing at each party member for confirmation.*

Alicia: "Yep." *She nodded her head with a smile.*

Lemon: "Where you come from?"

Pork: "I don't know."

Lemon: "Where'd you get that mallet from?" *He poked the mallet, causing it to squeak like a dog toy.*

Pork: "I don't know."

Jester: "Well, to sum up this chapter. Avocado and Lemon's mission was a failure. Apple learns a great technique through Pudding's training. And now we're ready for Battling Oxident!"

Madora: (I wonder how everyone is taking this play.) *She smiled to herself, watching the scene change.*

Sausage: "Welcome to this game's Battling Oxident! Contestants, get your twinkies ready!"

Lezard: *He stared at a long thin table with several contestants behind it, watching them raise twinkies to their face.* (Oh, that's right. It's a food eating contest-)

Sausage: "Ready! Begin!"

Apple: *He shoved four twinkies in his mouth.* "I've trained, I can't let Pudding down!-" *He mumbled with his mouth full.*

PKMY: (Heh.)

Jester: "So, let me sum up this chapter."

Season: (Twinkies? Hohoho, oh dear-)

Jester: "Well, the champion completely beats our heroes, but no fear! After it finishes, we get a splendid surprise!"

Avocado: *She walked out of Battling Oxident's sphere and glanced around Surpreon.* "Where-?"

?????: "You!"

Avocado: "W-Who-?"

?????: "My sisters!" *She grunted with anger and stared at Avocado with evil intent.*

Avocado: (It's Tinky One!)

Tinky One: "I'll kill you!"

Avocado: "N-No-" *She held a handful of ice cubes and readied to throw them at Tinky One.*

Tinky One: "That won't work on me!" *She flashstepped in front of Avocado and smirked, poking her with a stick.*

Avocado: *She watched the stick gently tap her arm, causing her to scream in pain.* "P-Please-" *She spoke under her breath, collapsing to the ground.*

Tinky One: "No mercy, I will end you!" *She over enthusiastically pointed the stick at Avocado's head.*

Alicia: *She kept to herself, triggering flashbacks of Cindy's lightning piercing through her leg.* (I thought I was going to-..)

Tinky One: "Now, die!-" *A spray of red glitter hit her back, causing her to screech in agonising pain.*

Avocado: "W-Who..?"

Tinky One: "Damn, you-.." *She dropped to her knees and fell to the ground, lying motionless.*

Milky: *He hobbled up to Avocado, who lost consciousness.* "Little monster! I hope she's okay!" *He adjusted the bowl on his head, staring at her in a worried manner.*

Jester: "So our poor little hero, Avocado was sent to the inn for emergency recovery!"

PKMY: *She stared at Avocado, discreetly forming a fist.* (I didn't know she suffered like that-)

Jester: "Even Taco was shaken up and confronted Sausage wanting to know what was happening."

Pepper: "Sausage is Season, yeah?" *She leant towards Alicia for confirmation.*

Alicia: "Tee hee, yep."

Jester: "Sausage explains he was searching for Milky for information to the five Unknown Curries."

Lance: "Unknown Curries?"

Teresa: "Perhaps he means The Unknown Territories."

Jester: "So after a few heart-warming scenes, our heroes, Milky, Taco, Lemon and Apple embark on their adventure to the first Unknown Curry. The Ancient Curry."

Lezard: "Sounds mystifying."

Luna: *She rolled her eyes at Lezard.* (What a loser.)

Destiny: (But our friend?)

Luna: (Of course!) *She spoke in an annoyed manner as if it was obvious.*

Jester: "Although I'm a big fan of adventure, we are on a time limit, so another scene change."

Madora: (Despite seeing future events and knowing about the prophecies. It's quests and long adventures like this, I don't or can't foresee-)

Jester: "Our heroes enter the mazy Ancient Curry and encounter our first proper villain!" *He whimpered at the audience with a frightened look and focused his attention back to the stage.*

Lemon: *He ran into an ancient-like room and stopped.* "Who are you?!" *He stared at a man in a scientist coat.*

Man: "They call me Zucchini."

Lemon: "Flyin' butt nuggets?!"

Zucchini: "Bwahahahaha." *He raised his hands to the wall, causing one of the five glyphs to glow and spiral.* "It's alive! Alive! Bwahahrahahraha."

*Zucchini chuckled with insanity and spun around, twirling his scientist coat behind him.*

Lemon: "F-Freak."

Lance: (Zayden.. He was a freak.)

Zucchini: "Please choke on one of those butt nuggets you mentioned, bwarahaha." *He turned around and threw a smoke bomb under him, causing him to cough.*

Lemon: "Gah!-, he flashstepped?" *He shook his head in defeat as Zucchini ran out of the smoke cloud.*

Zucchini: *He ran past Lemon and out of the room.* (To the next Unknown Curry-)

Lemon: "If only I could flashstep.." *He grunted, blatantly ignoring Zucchini.*

Jester: "Apple and Milky finally found Lemon filled with confusion."

Lezard: "Ooo, why were they confusled?"

Luna: (Confusled?)

Jester: "It seems they took ages trying to find the room Lemon found in an instant. Plot hole? I think not, but still."

Lance: (I remember that, all they had to do was take a turn at the corridor thing and there was the room-)

Jester: "Well, our heroes set their next destination to The Sandy Curry."

Lance: "Sandy Curry?"

Teresa: "Despite the tedious name changes, it is following the course of the mission correctly."

Jester: "Now, in The Sandy Curry we are confronted by Zucchini once again! What will our heroes do?!" *He gasped to the audience.*

Lezard: "Lezard don't know about you, silly sausages, but this is getting interesting." *He watched the stage change scene with all his attention.*

Zucchini: "Bwahahaha, now the curry will be mine!"

*Taco, Lemon, Apple and Milky ran into the room, catching Zucchini's attention.*

Zucchini: "Oh?"

Apple: "Doers beware, it is me, Apple Lawyer here, to stop your fiendish ways! And I'll make you pay." *He pointed at Zucchini, staring at him with a lazy eye.*

Zucchini: *He spun around and twirled his scientist-like coat.* "Too late!" *He pointed to the second glyph which started to glow.* "It's alive! Bwahrahrarh."

Apple: "Too late?!"

Taco: "This attitude displeases, the Taco." *She clapped her hands and stood in a pose.*

Lemon: *He frowned at Zucchini.* "Nah, ya feral butt nugget-"

Avocado: "L-Lemon." *Her voice whispered in the air, causing Lemon to awkwardly look around.*

Alicia: "I-I wasn't even there." *She sounded annoyed, staring at the stage in an unimpressed manner.*

Zucchini: "None of you can stop the Consultant from having the curry!" *He threw a smoke bomb under him and quickly ran towards the party.*

Apple: *He ignored Zucchini who ran right past him and sighed.* "We lost him."

Taco: "Flashstepping, how tedious."

Milky: "Off to the next Unknown Curry!"

Lemon: "Right, we'll get him."

Apple: "That's what heroes do!" *He smiled and pointed in front of him with a lazy eye.*

Taco: "With the help of me, Taco, his defeat will be inevitable." *She clapped her hands and posed.*

Teresa: "Tcch, despite these characters having similar characteristics, I do not see any relatable traits with this Taco." *She frowned, causing PKMY and Holland to giggle at her.* "Hoh? Was there something in my fact that is humorous?"

PKMY: "N-No."

Holland: "Not at all, Teresa." *He mumbled in a deep voice, trying not to laugh.*

PKMY: (Oi, control yourself, your giggles are brushing off on me too!)

Holland: (Ha ha, it's too funny-)

Jester: "So our heroes take a long walk towards the next Unknown Curry!"

Madora: (More walking? Deary me, I should have presented them with means of teleportation much sooner-)

Jester: "I was going to skip to the next confrontation with Zucchini, but this moment made me awe."

Apple: *He looked into the distance and stared at an island, frowning to himself in determination.* (Taco, Milky, Lemon.. They're all counting on me-)

*Apple pulled out a bubble wand and inhaled deeply, raising it above his head.*

Apple: "MYSTIC SHIELD STRIKE"

*Apple blew air in the wand and bubbles scattered in front of him, causing Milky to cheer in excitement.*

Milky: "Come on, Apple! You can do it, you little monster!" *He adjusted the bowl on his head.*

Apple: *He watched the bubbles burst, causing him to stamp his foot and whimper.* "Some hero I am..-"

Taco: "Tcch, this displeases Taco by twenty eight point three percent."

Milky: *He looked towards the island and observed the ocean, noticing its choppy waves.* (The waves are too violent for our little monster.)

Lemon: *He gritted his teeth and sighed, staring at the waves across the ocean.* "You're my bestie, Apple!"

Apple: "O-Oh, good gravy." *He looked at Lemon in shock.*

Lemon: "I know you can do it!" *He smiled, boosting Apple's morale.*

Apple: "Lemon.."

Milky: "Come on! We're counting on you, you little monster!"

Apple: "This little monster hero! I can do this!" *He enthusiastically raised the bubble wand and spun around.* "Harh!"

*Apple inhaled deeply and leant back, blowing into the hole with his eyes closed.*

Taco: *She watched a stream of bubbles float above the rough water and merge, forming themselves into a bubble-made path.* "You did it, Apple!"

Milky: "We knew it!" *He raised his hand and knocked on the bowl, causing a hollow noise to echo.*

Lemon: "Yea!" *He quickly waved his hands above his head like an idiot.*

Jester: "An idiot indeed." *He sighed and faced the audience.*

Teresa: (That was an impressive feat by Ashton. Even containing us in his Mystic Shield on the ocean's bed.. I do regret not being able to help him.) *She thought with an emotionless face, unintentionally forming a fist.*

Jester: "Now, for our third confrontation with Zucchini! The activation of the third glyph." *He gasped in shock, causing Lezard to giggle in excitement.*

Lance: "Wait, who's he callin' an idiot?" *He grunted to himself, frowning at Jester in realisation.*

Jester: "Our heroes are in the throne room, staring Zucchini off!-"

Zucchini: "Too late, nothing can stop my mission." *He watched the third glyph glow and spiral.* "This curry will be mine in no time!"

Lemon: "No more flashsteppin', we will get ya!" *He ran towards Zucchini and raised his hand.*

Zucchini: "My captain ranking will defeat you." *He spun around and slapped Lemon on the cheek.*

Milky: "Oh no! A critical hit!"

Lemon: *He over enthusiastically spun around and collapsed on the ground next to Zucchini.* "I'm out-" *He moaned in pain as if he was severely beaten.*

Lance: "They're seriously makin' me look so stupid."

Alicia: "..." *She rubbed Lance's arm, causing him to smirk.*

Apple: "My turn." *He shouted with a lazy eye and pointed the bubble wand at Zucchini, blowing several bubbles towards him.*

Taco: *Her hands were tied to a pair of cheaply made handcuffs.* "If Taco was not bound, Taco would help."

Zucchini: *He stared at the slowly moving bubbles and waited.* "Hmm-" *He awkwardly looked around before stepping into the bubbles.* "Argh! Such power-"

*Zucchini purposely jumped back and rolled onto the floor, emphasising the damage he received from the bubbles.*

Apple: "Excellent, my Mystic Shield Strike did it!"

Zucchini: "You all!-" *He fake coughed and slowly stood up, grunting in anger.*

Milky: "We will what?"

Apple: "Yeah! Good unacceptable gravy." *He nodded his head and stepped forward, standing next to Milky for support.*

Zucchini: "None of you will get to taste the curry once my mission is completed!" *He threw a smoke bomb under him and ran past the party.*

Milky: "Blast, flashstepping-" *He grunted to himself before the area started to shake.*

Taco: *The handcuffs suddenly opened up, freeing her.* "Excellent, how convenient-"

*Several people with cone-shaped hats stood behind the stage and vibrated a large piece of foil, causing the sounds of thunder to be heard.*

Taco: *She looked up and tilted her head, listening to the thunder.* "We must leave. This place will fall in on itself."

Apple: "I agree!"

Milky: *He noticed brown streamers fall from the ceiling.* "The little monster is right-"

Taco: "Taco is always right."

Lance: *He pointed at the brown streamers in confusion.* "Wat's with the brown strings?"

Tyler: "I think they're meant to be streams of sand."

Lance: "Now that makes sense."

Alicia: "What did you think they were?"

Lance: "Tentacles."

Tyler: "What-?"

Jester: *He clapped his hands and smiled, watching Apple wave his bubble wand to each side.* "After another save by Apple, the party resided at Eon City, the city covered in snow."

Rachael: "I think everyone would know by now what Eon City is."

Luna: "Aha, I reckon."

Season: (Eon City..) *He thought to himself in recollection, causing him to smile.* (The snow is usually pure white after terrible storms, it's a very beautiful sight-)

Jester: "To me, the chapter is spent recovering and our heroes find themselves back at Surpreon."

Lezard: "Back at Surpreon? What about the curry?!"

Jester: "Why you ask? Because they ran out of leads and don't know where the fourth Unknown Curry is."

Pepper: (I say, the party went through a large ordeal-)

Jester: "So Taco confronts Sausage and tells him the bad news."

Taco: "Sausage, we have appeared to run out of leads and do not know where the fourth Unknown Curry is."

Sausage: "Oh dear?"

Tyler: (Jester just said that?)

Jester: "So after a stressful evening, our heroes find the opportunity to take some time off at the nearby beach."

*Taco, Milky, Trifle, Avocado, Lemon and Apple played in the water.*

Jester: "It wouldn't be a classic RPG without a luxurious beach scene. I can picture the fanboys thinking about our girls in their swimsuits!" *He giggled, focusing back to the stage.*

Milky: "This was fun, you evil little monsters." *He chuckled and hobbled out of the water, slowly making his way to the RPG bag.* "Oh dear-?"

*Milky lifted the bowl off his head, causing an eruption of water to explode on top of him.*

Jester: "Oh dear indeed! The RPG bag is missing."

Lezard: "Missing?" *He gasped to himself as if he was fully immersed in the play.*

Jester: "Oh, by the way, it stands for Rostical Powered Globe, the more you know." *He winked at the audience.*

Lance: "Wat, really?"

Tyler: *He nodded his head.* "In its prototype stages, only Rostical Users could power up the Neurons created to utilise the portable Reality Sekai. They've obviously advanced the glyphic formulas since then."

Lance: "And the globe part? It's a bag."

Tyler: "It's advertised these days as limitless, but back then, they speculated that it could only fit the same amount of mass as the planet."

Lance: "Only?"

Season: "You've done some research, Tyler."

PKMY: "Isn't he a researcher? Dumbarse."

Season: "Hohoho, I meant it as a compliment."

Ginger: *She frowned at the person playing Millard.* "Why was there so much water in his ridiculous hat? It is illogical."

Rachael: *She shrugged, looking over her shoulder to Ginger.* "I think it's meant to be for laughs."

Ginger: "Ey, Rachael. But nobody is laughing?"

Luna: "Aha." *She purposely chuckled, eavesdropping on Ginger's conversation.*

Jester: "So-" *He spoke in an annoyed manner, implying for the audience to be quiet.*

*Taco, Trifle, Avocado, Lemon and Apple ran onto the shore behind Milky.*

Avocado: "W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-" *She purposely stuttered as if she was making fun of Alicia's personality.* "Lemon."

Trifle: *He glanced at Avocado in confusion.* "Yeah, Avocado say, where RPG bag now?"

Tyler: "I don't talk like that-"

Milky: "I don't know, little monsters." *He spoke in shock and looked down, noticing footprints in the sand.* "These tracks! They will lead to the culprit."

Tyler, Alicia and Lance: *They looked at each other at the same time.* "Felix." *They mumbled to themselves, before looking back to the stage.*

Jester: "Oooh, who's good at mystery novels? Guess who it is!" *He paused and coughed.* "So, back to the story. Our party go through the forest and encounter the culprit."

Taco: "Turn around slowly, listen to what Taco says!"

Lemon: "Dirty thief!"

Avocado: "L-Lemon."

?????: "It is me, Fudge!" *He grinned and turned around, holding the RPG bag in his hand.*

Lemon: "Fudge, I'm Lemon and you're goin' down!"

Avocado: "L-Lemon." *She whispered to herself.*

Apple: "Another fiend?" *He pointed at Fudge with a lazy eye.*

Taco: "Taco says, get him!"

Fudge: "Not with my Rostical power!" *He quickly bent down and started throwing rocks at the party.* "ROCK SLIDE"

Milky: "Ground affinity!" *Several rocks bounced off the bowl on his head.*

Fudge: *He noticed Avocado and suddenly moaned with joy.* "Who is that?!" *He played with the pebbles in his hand, winking at Avocado.*

Lemon: *He grunted in anger and pointed at Fudge, hiding his obvious jealousy.* "Stoopud fudge nugget!-"

Trifle: *A pebble knocked him on the foot, causing him to scream like a girl.* "The pain! Me hurt yes?!"

Apple: "Violence is unacceptable?!" *He suddenly rolled on the ground, emphasising his frustration.* "No more violence."

Pepper: "I say, why is he rolling on the ground?"

Lance: ".. You're askin' the wrong person here.."

Taco: "Taco wants to know, what we should do?"

Milky: "We have no time for this-" *He concentrated and instantly threw red glitter in front of him.*

Fudge: *He gasped and watched the glitter sparkle in the light.* "T-Too hot-" *His limbs went numb and he collapsed onto the dirt.*

Taco: "It appears the sheer heat of your Rostical caused him to faint."

Milky: "It seems." *He smiled, sprinkling the excess glitter onto the ground.*

Avocado: "T-Trifle! I-I can heal you." *She ran up to Trifle and held her pendant with both hands, flickering the flashlight on and off in his face.*

Trifle: "Argh, me good feel much better." *He sighed in relief, trying not to squint at the flashing light.* "Thank you."

Lemon: "Humph." *He stormed up to Fudge and picked the RPG bag up.* "Got it!"

Taco: "Cue victory music!" *She started to do the robot, causing the party to dance like idiots.*

*Rachael, Luna, Nathan, Lezard, Karol, Blake, Cameron and Ginger laughed amongst themselves.*

Season: "So is this what you do when I'm not around?"

Lance: "Wateva." *He tried to be serious and watched the party dance, causing him to snicker.*

Alicia: "N-No."
Holland: "Ha ha." *He chuckled, scratching his facial hair.*

Pepper: "I say-" *She whispered to herself as a widening smile consumed her face.*

Teresa: *She glanced at Season with a slight frown.* "Enough insults."

Season: *He tried not to laugh.* "I'm not insulting anyone. It was you who said it's following the mission correctly-"

*Teresa silently folded her arms and ignored Season by staring at the stage.*

Jester: "The party spends some time together, obtaining a little more character development." *He nodded his head.* "Then we receive news from Surpreon about Zucchini's location!"

Teresa: (If I recall, this is where-)

Lance: "Ashton-"

Alicia: *She tightened her grip around Lance's hand for support.* "You don't have to watch this."

Lance: *He smiled which slightly twitched with sadness.* "It's fine, thanks."

Jester: "Back at Surpreon-" *His words cued the stage to warp into the research facility.* "Our heroes await Sausage's teleportation glyph-"

Lance: (I always hated waitin' for those stupid glyphs to charge up-)

Jester: "After getting the green light to go-" *He pulled on a party popper, causing streamers to scatter across the stage.* "They teleported into Zucchini's territory."

Zucchini: *He grinned like a mad scientist and stared at the party.* "Taco, I better bind you." *He threw a smoke bomb on the ground and ran directly towards the party.*

Apple: "Where-?"
Taco: "Taco can not see the hostile!"
Avocado: "L-Lemon."
Lemon: "Aye?!"

Zucchini: *He ran past the party, directly towards Taco with a smirk.* "I'm glad I learnt how to flashstep-"

Milky: "Watch out Apple and Lemon, he just flashstepped." *He looked around puzzled, trying to find Zucchini's location.*

Taco: "Taco senses him, he is very close-" *She gasped and noticed Zucchini directly in front of her.*

Zucchini: "Harh!" *He threw a small web-like net over Taco's head, causing her to pointlessly struggle.*

Taco: "Taco can not break free!"

Lemon: "Shit butt nuggets!"
Apple: "Good gravy."
Milky: "Frightening crazy monster."

Zucchini: "Now, you all will suffer."

Apple: "Not if we can help it." *He frowned in determination, pulling out his bubble wand.*

Milky: "Yeah." *He skipped on one leg and swayed red glitter in front of him.*

Lemon: "And I fail with no power! But I'll still recklessly charge for you, 'cause I'm a winner."

Lance: ('Cause I'm a winner? Really..?)

Jester: "Now, this is where Zucchini reveals his ability that disables Rostical!"

Ginger: (An ability to disable Remenistal-?)

Jester: "Frightening, until Taco somehow reveals Zucchini can only disable one element at a time. So our heroes muster up a plan and use their different fighting skills to their advantage."

*Lemon, Apple and Milky swarmed around Zucchini, slapping him across the face.*

Luna: "Great battle plan, guys."

Lance: "Ahh, shuddup."

Jester: "Things were going well until a horrible event happens." *He sighed and sniffed, emphasising his sadness.*

Tyler: "..."

Jester: "Zucchini decides to go all-out and prepares to strike Lemon for a killing blow."

Zucchini: *He raised a large stick and ran towards Lemon, pointlessly growling in anger.* "Harh!"

Lemon: *He awkwardly leant on the ground and panted in exhaustion, looking up to Zucchini in shock.* "No!-"

Apple: "I got this!" *He jumped in front of Lemon and blew several bubbles towards Zucchini.*

Zucchini: *He gasped at Apple's sudden movement, watching the stick poke into one of the bubbles.* "Arh-?!" *An explosion of bubbles enveloped the area.*

Apple: *He gasped and looked down.* "..."

Ginger: (That looks like a mastered Bubble Blast Remenistal.. Once a sphere of condensed Astragons bursts, it erupts into another cycle of spheres. And those spheres being bubbles-)

Apple: "Good gravy.." *He noticed Zucchini's stick poking him on the chest, causing him to cough out tomato sauce.*

Zucchini: *The bubbles popped around him, causing him to notice the stick.* (In the heart?)

Apple: "Un-accept-abool."

Zucchini: "Brawhawrhawrh." *He chuckled like a crazy scientist and watched Apple collapse into Lemon's arms.*

Rachael: *Her smile suddenly faded into realisation.* (What...?)

Lemon: "Y-You!" *He stared at Apple in disbelief and grunted in anger.* "LIGHTNING BLAST" *He shouted, throwing a yellow streamer at Zucchini.*

Zucchini: *He held the streamer against his chest and violently twitched, stepping back in pain.* "I-I won't be defeated-" *He threw a smoke bomb and ran out of the area.*

Lemon: "No!-" *He looked down and quickly hovered over Apple, pouting in a serious manner.*

Apple: "Stay strong, you'll become the person I've always seen in you.. Unacceptable."

Lemon: "You're my hero!"

Apple: *He smiled and looked at Lemon as if he had lost his vision.* "G-Good gravy-"

Jester: "Touching-" *He waved his hands in front of his face, as he tried not to cry.* "I'm not good with sad scenes, so we'll be skipping past the sad moments..."

Lance: (Ash...)

Jester: *He coughed to clear his throat.* "Lemon decides to seek the same teacher Apple did. Instead of trying to find a way home, Lemon now decides to walk the path of revenge!"

PKMY: *She stared at Jester, intentionally not looking at the other party members.* (A sudden wave of sadness just filled the air..)

Pepper: (I never met this Ashton, but may the spirits bless him in The Astral Plains-)

Holland: (No, Ashton...)

Freya: (So, that's how...)

Alicia: "A-Are you okay?" *She whispered, looking at Lance in a worried manner.*

Lance: "Y-Yea." *He rubbed her hand with his thumb, slowly nodding his head.*

Jester: "Alright, Taco takes Lemon to Pudding's domain-" *He coughed and sniffed, trying to move the play along.*

Rachael: (Ash..)

Luna: "You all good, Rach?"

Rachael: "Yeah." *She smiled, trying to hide her obvious sadness.*

Destiny: (I'm worried about Rachael.)

Luna: (I am too..)

Destiny: (...)

Jester: "After a long training session, Lemon finally acquires the power of Rostical!"

Taco: *She glanced at Lemon, watching him stand at the edge of The Great High Plains.* "Taco wants to know, is he able to leave?" *She stared at Pudding's raging muscles.*

Pudding: "He'll have to- shit-damn-wateva-" *His/Her head twitched.* "He'll have to wait here in order to recover from the strenuous training."

Taco: "Taco sees." *She nodded her head.*

Tyler: (Why did Pudding's speech suddenly go weird for a moment?) *He thought to himself in a curious manner.*

Lance: "Wait, was that the syndrome that starts with a tee?" *He spoke with a frown as if he couldn't remember the name.*

Tyler: "Lance, that's mean."

Lance: "N-No, I'm being serious, aye."

Jester: "Now, the first time skip, well, not including the prologue. Let me brief you in. Lemon recovers for several months after learning his new Remenistal and leaves Pudding's care."

Lance: (I remember... That was when things started to get serious.. Well, after Ash.. That's what it felt like.) *He thought to himself in recollection, continuing to rub his thumb along Alicia's hand.*

Jester: "On Lemon's adventure, he encounters Pork and Hungry, and together, they make their way to Surpreon."

Holland: *He looked at Pepper with a smirk.* "We're finally back in the story."

Pepper: *She nodded her head and smiled.* "I say, excellent, yeah?"

Jester: "After Lemon, Pork, Hungry and Fish-Fingers browse Surpreon, they discover another Battling Oxident is being prepared by Trifle."

Tyler: (I was really proud about my work-)

Jester: "We also soon find out, Avocado.. Is with.. The villain!" *He spoke in a slow and excited manner.*

Lezard: "Sh-She was?!" *He spoke in suspense, giving Jester all his attention.*

Jester: "But we don't know that yet!"

Season: (Ridley.. I honestly had no idea who he was..)

Jester: "So Avocado, after mentioning Lemon several times, investigates the fourth Unknown Curry!"

Teresa: (The Sacred Waters.)

Jester: "After a stir of events, the sanctum's own Guardian activates the glyph-" *He stared at the audience.* "Which isn't a good thing."

Alicia: *She had images of Lucky which caused her to look down.* (Lucky..)

Lance: "It's OK.." *He reassured Alicia, staring at her in a worried manner.* "I'm with you."

Alicia: "R-Right."

Jester: "If you couldn't have guessed, it was the villain who corrupted the Guardian!"

Alicia: (It was Ridley?)

Jester: "Now, this is where we focus on the individual characters which I personally love! We explore Hungry's story, featuring Fish-Fingers. We later find out Milky is actually a Consultant, then we find out Taco is actually an ex-captain."

*Jester shook his head in an overwhelmed manner, causing himself to chuckle.*

Jester: "Talk about a plot twist!" *He smiled and looked back to the stage.* "After all this, everyone is reunited back at Surpreon!"

Ginger: (Interesting-)

Jester: "So, now we're at Sausage's manor for another comic-relief chapter."

Pudding: *She/He staggered towards Taco.* "I'm angry at you because of those!"

Taco: "Taco does not understand your intoxicated dribble-?"

Pudding: *She/He pointed at Taco's chest.* "Why are yours- shit-bitch-dick-dammit-" *His/Her head twitched.* "Jingly."

Lemon: *He pointed at Pudding.* "Looks like she's Docta Jingles." *He spoke with a smirk, motioning his hands as if he had large breasts.*

*Holland chuckled with Lance, causing PKMY to grunt in realisation.*

PKMY: "Th-That's where the nickname came from?" *She looked at Holland awaiting confirmation.*

Lance: "Yea-"

PKMY: "OK."

Holland: *He glanced at PKMY in confusion.* (Knowing her, I thought she was going to attack-)

PKMY: "After the play, I'm going to slaughter you both." *She spoke in a calm manner and stared at the stage with a happy smile.*

*Holland and Lance shivered at PKMY's calm threat.*

Jester: *He glanced to the audience.* "And that's why, children, drinking is bad-"

PKMY: (Drinking is bad my ass-) *She grunted to herself, folding her arms at Jester.*

Jester: "But that scene was hilarious, just wanted to say."

PKMY: (I'm glad you found it so hilarious.) *She thought to herself with growing anger.*

Jester: "So now we skip to where the quest becomes a little serious."

Sausage: "We believe there is a place to find the last Unknown Curry."

Villain: "That would be excellent."

Hungry: "A floating city.."

Trifle: *He nodded his head at Hungry.* "But it's only rumours."

Lemon: "We might as well give it a try?"

Taco: "Taco agrees."

Avocado: "L-Lemon." *She whispered to herself.*

Jester: "So let me sum this chapter up due to budget problems."

Season: (Budget problems?)

Jester: "Our heroes end up in Valhalla, the holy floating city above the clouds. Really mystical if you ask me." *He giggled at the audience like a child.*

Rachael: (The areas Arcadia has shown me, it really is amazing-)

Jester: "During this time, Milky senses something unusual. After Avocado mentions Lemon's name several more times, they confront Milky wanting to know what the problem is."

Alicia: (I keep mentioning his name? Really?) *She sighed at herself.*

Jester: "Milky decides to leave Valhalla with Lemon and Avocado, while Taco and Pudding decide to stay with the divine people."

Alicia: "I remember how dark that night was-" *She whispered to herself in recollection.*

Jester: "Now here's the twist, the Consultant confronts our three heroes and takes Milky away from them!"

Lezard: (Father... Mother monster..) *He adjusted the cone-shaped hat with a serious face.*

Jester: "Please enjoy this high budget fight scene!"

Consultant: "You and those darn meddling children, and that feral dog-" *Fish-Fingers suddenly popped on to the stage and disappeared.* "-Have meddled in my plans for the last time!"

Milky: "Oh, honey monster-"

Consultant: "Let's fight, and we'll see who's the bigger monster!" *She reached into her pockets and smirked.*

Milky: "I see, I have no choice!" *He adjusted the bowl on his head and hobbled towards the Consultant.*

Consultant: *She spun around throwing her hands out of her pockets and two swirls of red and green glitter hit Milky.* "A-hah!" *She raised her arms and blew green glitter out from her hand.*

Milky: "Such power!" *He yelled at the top of his lungs before throwing a pocket of orange glitter at the Consultant.*

Karol: (Their choreography is well done-) *He watched the two actors fight in a dance-like manner, ignoring the sparkling glitter around them.*

Milky: "This is all I've got!" *He staggered back and concentrated, holding a large handful of white glitter in both his hands.*

Consultant: *She copied Milky's stance and concentrated.* "Take this!"

Jester: *He watched the Consultant and Milky throw glitter at the same time, causing an explosion of white, green and red glitter to swirl across the stage.* "Whoa! Did you all see that?!"

Lezard: *He stared at the glitter in a trance-like state, watching it fall on to the stage in slow motion.* (I bet it was an amazing fight-)

Luna: (We only just started to develop our Soul Link then, but I remember how terrifying that power was.)

Destiny: (Yes! I never felt anything like that before.)

Jester: *He chuckled in disbelief at the audience.* "Scene skip! The aftermath of the horrid fight."

Lemon: *He stood in horror with Avocado, watching Milky and the Consultant slowly lose consciousness.* "No, I started to respect your Milky ways!"

Milky: "M-My Milky ways, are sarcastically great."

Lemon: "Yea, I'm your little monster."

Avocado: "L-Lemon-" *She coughed and shook her head.* "I-I mean, Milky."

Lezard: "..." *He smiled with watering eyes, causing Luna and Nathan to comfort him for support.*

Milky: "Here-" *He struggled to lift his arms, slowly placing it on his head.* "Ensure it's left where it can be seen, for a nice symbolic meaning."

*Milky took the bowl off his head and presented it to Lemon.*

Milky: "I wasn't bad for an old monster, was I?"

Lemon: "Nah, you were an epic old monsta." *He smiled, gently taking the bowl in respect.*

Avocado: "No-" *She looked away and cried like a witch.* "I'm melting.. Melting."

Tyler: "That's really sad."

Season: "I agree."

Lemon: "Come, Avocado. Let us hold hands and finally express our feelings in denial, inspired by that emotional scene."

Avocado: "Lemon-" *She sniffed through her witch-like nose, watching Lance hold her hand.*

Lemon: "We'll embark back to Surpreon." *He placed the bowl on the ground and started to walk out of the village.*

Avocado: *She walked by Lemon's side.* "Lemon, Lemon, Lemon-"

Lemon: "Wat?"

Avocado: "N-Nothing, I needed to say your name four more times before the scene finished."

Lemon: "Flyin' butt gravy nuggets, that was thr-"

Avocado: "L-Lemon-"

Jester: "So after this scene, we skip to the next chapter."

Holland: (So Millard died with the other Consultant.) *He nodded his head in understanding.* (I know it was said, but it was easier for me to see it.)

Jester: "We have a little flashback of the horrible villain-" *He quickly hissed at the audience, startling Tyler and Lezard.* "Then we discover that one of our heroes, Sausage, has fallen ill!"

Lezard: "Oh no, not Sausage!"

Jester: "Don't fret, Trifle is on his first mission with Pudding and Hungry, and they're on their way to find a cure!"

Holland: *He smirked and placed his hands in front of PKMY and Tyler, causing them to hi-five it.* "It was awesome."

Tyler: "S-Sure was." *He nervously smiled.*
PKMY: "Heh." *She smirked in agreement.*

Jester: "So our heroes run through the dangerous forest, The Twilight Forest, with the help of an unexpected friend-" *He glanced at Lezard with a smile.*

Lezard: "Yay, that was me, silly sausages-"

Luna: "Lezard-"

Lezard: "Sorry."

Jester: "And after things start to look pretty grim, they finally find the location to the cure." *He coughed and watched the stage warp into a different part of the forest.*

Trifle: *He looked up at Pudding's large muscles, as he/she towered over him.* "B-But, how we can get there up?" *He pointed at a white flower, which grew on the tip of a large tree.*

Pudding: *He/She sniffed and flexed her/his muscles.* "It would be easy as- shit-damn-crap-poop-"

Trifle: "Ah.. Y-Yes-" *He heard loud roars in the surrounding forest, causing him to squeal like a little boy.*

Pudding: "Dangerous Scoldrants-" *He/She mumbled to him/herself before running towards the tree.* "Don't look back!"

Trifle: "For Sausage, I'll do this for Sausage, the Sausage everyone looks at when things get hard!"

Lance: *He giggled like a child.* "Oh really, Tyler?"

Tyler: "N-No?" *He shook his head with innocence.* "It just sounds out of context."

Lezard: "Really, quick fingers?" *He smirked at Tyler, sounding seedy.*

Season: "Everyone, please watch PKMY and Tyler save me." *He spoke with a slight smile.*

Trifle: *He ran after Pudding, listening to the sounds of heavy footsteps behind him.* "Oh no, I'm going wee to my pants!"

Pudding: *He/She jumped onto the tree and started to climb it.* "I have to get this flower!-"

Trifle: *He squealed and looked behind him.* "No!" *He watched four pink fluffy rabbit-like Scoldrants hopping after him.*

Pudding: "Hold them off!" *He/She screamed in determination, as he/she reached towards the flower.* "I can't reach the flower-"

Trifle: *He squealed again and looked up, starting to panic in fear.* "W-Why, it's in length arm's?!"

Pudding: "Well-" *He/She flicked the flower with her fingers, purposely missing it.* "We gotta wait until the rabid Scoldrants come into striking distance."

Trifle: "Why?!" *He stood under the tree and squealed like a girl, squirming on the spot.*

Pudding: "For suspensive purposes!-"

Trifle: "Th-They're going to us eat!" *He waved his hands to his sides and turned around, facing the incoming Scoldrants.* "No!-"

Pudding: *He/She noticed the rabbits about to attack Trifle, causing her to grab the flower on cue.* "Got it!-"

Trifle: *The area blurred around him.* "Please, I'm trying not to wee wee my pants."

Lance: "Ahahahaha, wee wee."

PKMY: *She smirked and glanced at Tyler.* "I did smell something strange-"

Tyler: "O-Oh be quiet you two."

Alicia: "Yeah, stop picking on him."

PKMY and Lance: "Wateva."

Holland: "Hmph." *He chuckled to himself.*

Jester: "Phew-" *He sighed in relief holding his chest.* "That was frightening."

Lezard: "It was!" *His guild members stared at him with annoyance.* "What? It was?"

Jester: "Luckily due to their hard efforts, they were able to give Sausage the cure for his stricken illness. Several chapters later, we're given a little more depth into Taco's character."

Teresa: (The Grand Seal. This would have occurred around the time frame these events happened.)

Jester: "We are introduced to Taco's friends, but seriously, the only one worth mentioning is Cupcake. That female is hilarious-"

Cupcake: "Oh shit all over ya face." *She groaned at Taco with a feral hardcore-like face.*

Taco: "Insinuating to dispose of all your waste on someone's face, this displeases Taco."

Cupcake: "Oh, get in badly! Whoup whoup!"

Jester: "Haha." *Several people chuckled in the audience.* "Hil-arious."

Tyler: *He face palmed with a slight smirk.* (That's how I remember her.)

Teresa: (There is no arguing that Chrisma can not handle her excitement well, but she does not act like the complete fool portrayed here.)

Lezard: *He noticed several guild members giggling at Chrisma's character, causing him to slightly pout with a frown.* "You're all jealous that you're no longer part of Lezard's harem."

Jester: "Well, after this chapter. Sausage decides to take Lemon on a personal training session, because really, the villain completely destroyed the entire party."

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She looked to the side annoyed, triggering images of Ridley using his dark affinity Rostical on her.*

Season: *He had a flashback of using Piercing Clouds against Lance.* (Lance did well in that session.)

Jester: "Sausage successfully taught Lemon how to flashstep and Lemon used that to his advantage during the next Battling Oxident."

Tyler: "Wasn't it a food eating contest?"

Jester: "Yes? He flashstepped to each twinky."

Tyler: "...-"

Jester: "So after the sub-plots and more character development, we're back on the story!" *He smiled at the audience.*

Pepper: (All this is really interesting, since it feels like I've missed most of this.)

Jester: "After a few key plot devices, our heroes are told they need to find Mandarin. So they embark on another quest to find the Astragon ghost ship, scary!"

Pepper: (I remember The Aspestosis Ship-)

Jester: "They find the item to find Mandarin to find the location to find the next Unknown Curry." *He took a deep breath and nodded his head with a sigh.* "That was a mouthful."

Locki: *He nudged Madora.* "You're back in the story."

Madora: *She smiled and nodded her head.* "Oh deary me."

Jester: "Soon after, our heroes find themselves in a village of awesome Remenistal Users." *His words caused several cheers to echo from behind the stage.*

Pepper: (I say, he's talking about himself-)

Jester: "So after exploring the best village, they end up seeing a familiar face. One they haven't seen in a while."

Blake: (A face they haven't seen in a while?)

Mio: (This play is bothersome to me. I do not care.)

Blake: (Ah, don't be such a downer, hey.)

Lezard: "Who was this familiar face?"

Jester: "Someone from their hometown." *He spoke under his breath, causing Rachael to gasp in confusion.*

Rachael: "Huh?"

Luna: (Who would that be-?)

Jester: "Unfortunately, Mandarin had to send her home-" *He sighed, shrugging his shoulders.* "'Cause no one liked her, not even the Neurons or Astragons themselves."

Tyler: (Melinda..)

Jester: "So our heroes left the amazing village to continue their journey to the last Unknown Curry."

Alicia: (I remember that day, I was really excited and nervous-)

Jester: "Skipping a few scenes, we encounter Tummy! But she didn't like Pudding so they fought."

PKMY: (Because of the Rachael incident..)

Jester: "Meanwhile, Avocado, Lemon and Taco found themselves with the villain at the last glyph. Well, the joke was on him because Avocado did it!"

Alicia: *She had flashbacks of the white light swirling around her, as her body disintegrated into tiny white orbs.* (I remember that pain, no matter how many times I remember-)

*Alicia held her chest and grabbed the pendant's chain, running her fingers along it until she reached the pendant itself.*

Alicia: (The pain, it's indescribable.. I never want to feel that again-)

Jester: "But, our little Avocado went to sleep for a little while."

Rachael: "Why?"

Jester: "Ah, my first question from you." *He giggled to himself.* "The repercussions caused by sealing the last glyph, of course, the villain knew of this. That dirty sly, but-"

*Jester looked up and sounded positive, causing PKMY to unintentionally smile.*

Jester: "Things will eventually come to a happy ending, so don't let this drama turn you away! We learn about the villain's history via flashback, and it was unusually touching for me."

Lance: "Huh?"

Alicia: "I-I don't know." *She shook her head, staring at the stage in confusion.*

Jester: "Then we learn more about Pork and The Sacred Chops."

Pepper: "Me again, yeah?"

Jester: "And boy, that scene with her old party members, it was an awesome fighting chapter-"

*Pork, Lorilei, Locki, Cassidy and Raphael danced around a large snake-like Ancioldrant.*

Jester: "And they used their five-way Hi-Ougi. A splendid victory if you ask me.. Around this time, we're introduced to the mighty guild!" *He waved his hand across Rachael's guild with a smile.* "And they lead our heroes to Silver Wind Island."

Blake: "Yeah bitches, the mighty guild." *He smirked, causing Nathan, Rachael and Luna to smile.*

Jester: "So after another rally of interesting character development chapters, we encounter Zucchini once again!" *He gasped at the audience before looking back to the stage.*

Rachael: (This is when I found out that bastard killed my Ashton-)

Zucchini: "K-Karkark." *He bent forward with a large hunchback, laughing like a crazy scientist.*

Jester: "Be careful, Hungry and Lemon!" *He watched Zucchini hysterically laugh at them.*

Season: *He smirked at Zucchini and nudged PKMY.* "Looks like there's a boulder under his shirt."

PKMY: "Heh, yea."

Zucchini: "Nothing can defeat me now."

Lemon: "But you destroyed my hero!" *He yelled in anger.*

Zucchini: "Y-Your hero? The Consultant is my hero."

Lemon: "You dirty butt nugget!"

Zucchini: "I-I basically defeated his version of my hero-" *He shook his head and slowly turned away.* "As a scientist, I failed."

Lemon: "Why?!"

Zucchini: "I only live for the Consultant, my idol, my role model, my hero. I defeated your hero, I'm disgusted in myself."

Lemon: "Wait a blazin' shit nugget! You can't suddenly go all good on us, you're an evil villain, no one is meant to relate to you!"

Zucchini: "If I've got fans, then maybe I'm not that much of a failure?" *He smirked and tapped his head with the stick, causing him to discreetly drop a smoke bomb under him.*

Lemon: *The smoke enveloped Zucchini's feet.* "H-He's gone?"

Jester: "I don't know about you, but I didn't expect the ending of Zucchini to be like that." *He shook his head.*

Rachael: (Me neither, so it was hard to stay angry at him..) *She looked up to the ceiling with an ill-appearing face.* (Or maybe it was Ashton..?)

*Rachael coughed and wheezed, quickly wiping a layer of sweat off her forehead.*

Rachael: (Ash would've wanted me to forgive-)

Jester: "So afterwards, our heroes find a way to restore Avocado when finding out she was sealed into the curry's glyph."

Lance: (I was really happy, a wave of relief rushed through my body-)

Jester: "This little scene was heart-warming for me, because, Lemon offers his own life energy to help restore Avocado back to normal." *He smiled.*

Alicia: *She looked down to her lap and smiled.* (Although I still believe I'm not worth anyone's life, what Lance wanted to do.. I don't know how I was blessed with someone like him-)

Jester: "So our four heroes, Lemon, Mandarin, Cupcake and Trifle try and find the glyph of the fifth Unknown Curry."

Madora: "Oh deary, I forgot about this."

Celest: "About what?"

Locki: "Hmm?"

Madora: "This is when we-"

Jester: "They find the glyph and restore Avocado back to normal!"

Lance: (Alicia..) *He discreetly glanced at Alicia and sighed in a loving manner, catching her attention.*

Alicia: *She noticed his unusual facial expression, causing her to look at him worried.* "What's wrong?"

Lance: "I-I didn't mean to get your attention." *He paused and quickly looked at the stage with blushing cheeks.*

Alicia: "N-No, tell me." *She leant slightly forward to get a better look at his face.*

Lance: "It's just, it reminded me how much I missed you."

Alicia: "Lance-"

Lance: "Let me finish. It reminded me of how upset I was. I-I was-" *He slowly inhaled.* "Really sad without you. Having you come back instantly filled that void and-" *He paused and shook his head speechless.*

Alicia: *She covered her smile with an empathetic frown.* "It's alright." *She placed her hand on top of his.* "I won't leave you again. I promise."

Lance: "Hmm." *He slowly nodded his head as if something else was bothering him.*

Jester: "Now, Mandarin decides to reward our heroes by upholding Lance's promise by showing Avocado his hometown. Then bam!-" *His yell caused Tyler and Karol to jump in fright.*

Tyler: (His voice always startles me. It's like one of the speaker-like glyphs is near me.)

Jester: "She sent 'em to Dee Highs with her magic!"

Lemon: *He woke up in a park with Avocado.* "Ah?"

Avocado: "Lemon." *She whispered his name with a passion.*

Lemon: "Ah yea?"

Avocado: "N-Nothing?" *Wild screams caused her to become alert.* "Sounds like someone is getting hurt badly!"

Lemon: "Come on, let's check it out!" *He ran towards the screams which echoed from behind a set of park orientated trees.*

Cupcake: "Whoaroah! Oh, shit all over ya faces." *She rode a child's swing while hysterically laughing.* "Whoup whoup!" *She barked at the children, causing them to run away screaming.*

*Several of the audience members chuckled.*

Jester: "It becomes even better! Scene skip."

Tyler: "Yep." *He face palmed in a frustrated manner.*

Jester: "After more hilarious antics with Cupcake, we find ourselves at everyone's work!"

Rachael: (Fast Food Enterprise.)

Cupcake: *She sat in the dining room with Trifle and stared at a burger in confusion.* "Wharh!? What is this?"

Trifle: "G-Give it bite."

Cupcake: "It probably won't taste-" *She took a little nibble from the burger and she gasped.* "I'm gonna shit over everyone's faces!"

*Cupcake stood up with a roar, causing Trifle to squeal in shock.*

Cupcake: "Nomnomnom." *She started to devour the burger like a pig.*

Trifle: *He discreetly looked across the dining room and noticed all the customers staring at Cupcake in disgust.* "Oh gosh my, I'm so embarrassed."

Jester: "Ahaha." *He chuckled and glanced at the party.*

Lance: "Oi, Tyler?"

Tyler: "Yes..?" *He spoke with low morale, knowing Lance was going to say something mean.*

Lance: "That went pretty well for your first date-"

Holland: "Ha ha, haha!" *He burst into laughter, causing him to quickly look at Tyler in an apologetic manner.*

Tyler: "Lance, you're a dick."

Lance: "Aha, you saw it comin', though?"

Tyler: *He smirked, silently nodding his head.* (Yeah, haha.)

Jester: "Scene skip!"

Season: *He smiled to himself, watching the scene change.* (I wonder what happens next?)

Cupcake: *She stood in a line holding a paintball gun.* "How does it work?" *She pointed the gun in Trifle's face.*

Trifle: "You pull the little trigger with finger your." *He demonstrated by pulling his finger as he stared in front of him, listening to the instructor.*

Cupcake: "Oh-" *She pulled the trigger with curiosity, causing a paintball to shoot in Trifle's face.* "H-Huh? Oh, get this shooter in?!"

Tyler: *He moaned and rubbed his cheek.* (They hurt no matter how close or far away you're shot-)

Cupcake: *She looked concerned at Trifle, then suddenly smiled in an evil-like manner.* "Whoup whoup!"

Jester: "Achievement unlocked. Cupcake for secret dungeon villain."

Cupcake: "I'll be shitting on everything that moves!" *She raised her hands above her head and started to shoot all the players in sight.*

Trifle: *He rubbed a large red dot on his cheek which oozed black paint.* "The game started hasn't yet!-"

Cupcake: "Bwahrahrahr. MYSTIC SHIELD STRIKE" *She screamed in excitement, shooting all the players in the face.* "Whoupster whoup whoup."

Trifle: "What does whoupt whoupt even mean?!"

Cupcake: "It means-" *She quickly faced Trifle and smirked.* "Die!" *She pointed the shooter at Trifle.* "SOLAR FLARE-"

Jester: "This is too gruesome to watch! So let's skip to the scene where our heroes are transferred back to the land of Remenistal!"

Ginger: "Affirmative! Remenistal!"

PKMY: "So, Tyler, with what Lance said, you thinking about Chrisma being your girlfriend?"

Lance: *He heard PKMY and instantly hissed with laughter.* "Ahahaha."

Tyler: "B-Be quiet."

Season: "Hoho-" *He chuckled and covered his mouth.*

Tyler: "Not you too, Season."

Holland: "I'm sure she'd call you quick fingers too-"

Tyler: *He gasped in betrayal, causing Alicia to giggle.* "E-Even Holland?!"

Jester: "So since we're skipping the fights, we'll ignore the big family feud!"

Pepper: (Family feud?)

Jester: *He took a deep breath and stared at the audience.* "After one of the biggest fights in the entire adventure, we find out that the villain is finally on the move!"

PKMY: (Family feud? What a shit way of explaining it-)

Jester: "For those who don't know, he intends to open a Spacial Funnel to enter a new world."

Villain: *He popped onto the stage and glanced at the audience.* "I am now on the move. I intend to open up a Spacial Funnel to enter a new world."

Jester: "But none of our heroes knows this just yet!"

Lance: "Then how did you know that the villain was makin' his move if we didn't even know-?"

Jester: *He ignored Lance and kicked his feet on the stool.* "We skip past more heart-warming character tales, oh!" *He snapped his finger as if he almost forgot something.* "Nearly forgot, Taco removed her emotional seal."

Teresa: (He must have skipped a considerable amount, it was not long ago I removed The Grand Seal.)

Jester: "Now with her emotional seal gone, her character has slightly changed-" *He stared at Taco who popped on to the stage.*

Taco: "This displeases Taco, whoup whoup." *She clapped and waved her hands above her head with an emotional smile.*

Jester: "Aha, oh Taco, I don't know how you're the writer's favourite."

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She folded her arms in a professional manner, looking away from the stage.*

Jester: "Now, we come up to my favourite non-fighting scene involving Hungry and Pudding."

PKMY: "Hungry and Pudding? Oh no-" *She grunted to herself.*

Holland: *He looked at PKMY in shock.* "He couldn't possibly mean-"

PKMY: (Please don't show it, please don't show it, please don't show-)

Hungry: *He held Pudding's hand with a romantic smile.* "Are you ready?"

Pepper: "I say, this is romantic. When did you two find the time to relax-?"

Pudding: "I want to violently rip your clothes off-"

Pepper: *She stared at the stage in confusion.* "Huh?"

PKMY: "..."

Pudding: "And give you the enthusiasm of a hundred hungry Battling Oxident competitors-"

Hungry: "One hundred hungry twinky eaters?" *He smirked as if he enjoyed the idea.*

Jester: "If you know what she and-or he means." *He winked at the audience with a cheesy smile.*

Tyler: *He looked confused.* "I don't get it."

Alicia: "Me neither."

Holland: *His face turned red.* "I wouldn't worry over it-"

PKMY: "Y-Yea, ignore it-"

Hungry: "I'm ready when you are."

Pudding: "I am, take me!"

Hungry: *He took a nervous breath and smiled.* "Okay!"

Jester: "They held hands tightly, then they did it!" *He squealed like an excited child.*

Lance: "Oh my-" *His jaw dropped as he realised what the scene implied.*

PKMY: *Her face turned as red as a tomato, causing her to slightly slide down the seat in embarrassment.* (I can't look at anyone, I can't believe they portrayed what me and Holly did, to everyone!-)

Holland: *He chuckled and scratched behind his head.* "So what?"

Season: "PKMY?" *He gasped in shock, causing PKMY to curl up into a tiny ball.*

Teresa: "This displeases, Teresa." *Her voice caused the entire party including PKMY to laugh.*

PKMY: (Heh, thanks.)

Teresa: (Hmph.) *She nodded her head in response, acknowledging PKMY's appreciation.*

Jester: *He waved a fan in front of his face as blood ran down his nose.* "Alright, ahem. Several chapters later, we find out about the villain's weakness!"

Cameron: (The Rubistral Moon.)

Jester: "This revelation sparks the party to find his location. So after a few side quests and favours, our heroes hop on board the Sheridan."

Season: (And then we set sail to The Lost Land to confront the Consultant.)

Jester: "I'm a little sad, we're two scenes away from the finale, so.. Lemon defeats the villain!"

Lemon: *Swirls of black glitter spiralled across the stage and over to the audience.* "That's for Milky and everyone!"

Alicia: *She looked up and watched black glitter spiral on to the party.* (Pretty-)

Pepper: "I say, you need to tell me what happened, yeah?"

Tyler: *He looked at Pepper, nodding his head in agreement.* "Sure."

Jester: "Then after this scene, our heroes are rushed back into recovery."

PKMY: (I didn't like that feeling-)

Holland: *He glanced at the red-faced PKMY.* (She was mumbling and stuttering most of her words, it was a little frightening, but she recovered really well-)

Jester: "Then we begin, the rebuilding stage."

Tyler: (Surpreon-)

Jester: "And then, they lived happily ever after." *He giggled and stood up off the stool.*

Lezard: (Ever since the Consultant was defeated, I've felt like a new person.) *He sniffed slowly, brushing black glitter off his arms in satisfaction.*

Jester: "And there you have it. The end!" *He rushed into the middle of the stage, causing all the members who played the party to run onto the stage.*

*The entire party stood up and clapped, cheered and whistled.*

Lezard: "Encore! Encore!"

Lance: "Aha, besides relivin' some of the shit moments. It was awesome!"

Teresa: "Indeed. It was fascinating reminiscing on some of these events with emotions." *She smiled at Lance, continuing to clap at Jester and the actors.*

Tyler: "You've been quiet, Pepper?"

Pepper: *She shook her head, implying nothing was wrong.* "It was fascinating."

Luna: "That went by quickly."

Rachael: "Hehe. I didn't know they went through so much."

Blake: "Amy's actor was hilarious."

Nathan: "I think it was on point."

Lezard: "Bwarharh."
Karol: "Nee hee."

Alicia: *She looked at Lance before glancing at each party member.* "D-Despite bringing up awkward moments and reminding me of sad times. It just reassures me how much you all are my friends."

Teresa: "I-I concur." *She sounded surprised and smiled.* "I consider you all a valuable asset to my life too."

Holland: *He smirked and stared at each party member.* "Hug time-?"

PKMY: "Pfft, no Holly."
Teresa: "I will pass on this hug-"
Tyler: *He awkwardly smiled.* "N-No, thank you-"

Jester: "Now-" *He watched several actors sweep up the glitter.*

Lance: (Oh wat now?)

Jester: "We will begin the guild's quest." *He smiled and quickly hopped back onto his stool, causing the audience to slowly sit back down into their seats.*

Blake: "Yeah, bitches! This will be an awesome tale."

Rachael: "Hehe, Healing Monarchs, anyone?"

Ginger: "Healing Monarchs.. The Hi-Ougi that transcends Remenistal itself.." *She spoke in amazement, triggering images of black and orange butterflies shrouded in holy light.*

Jester: "Healing Monarchs?" *He pointed at Rachael and Ginger.* "Hey, that's a spoiler!"

Rachael: "Sorry. Please go on."

Lezard: "At least another character understands the respect about spoilers-"

Luna: "Shut it, Lizard."

Lezard: "It's-"
Blake: "It's Lizard." *He spoke with a deeper voice and shook his bottom to each side, pretending to be Lezard.*

Lezard: "Well! Excuse me! Words can break these old bones! Ooo!" *He stood up and fled from the scene, causing Blake to look at his guild members in shock.*

Blake: "I didn't mean-"

Rachael: "It's okay. He's Lezard."

Luna: "If he can't take wat he dishes out, then that's on him."

Ginger: "I concur."

Nathan: "Should we see how he is?"

Karol: "No! Our story is about tooh come on!"

Jester: "Alright." *He coughed to clear his throat, causing the spotlight to only shine on him.*

Cameron: *He blankly stared at Blake.* "..."

Blake: "Wat?" *He sounded sad as if Cameron's look upset him.*

Jester: "Alright." *He coughed to clear his throat, causing the spotlight to only shine on him.*

Lance: *He looked at the stage and waited for the intro.* (This will be interesting-) *He shook his head in disorientation.*

Holland: (I wouldn't mind knowing what Nathan and his party members did.)

Lance: (Huh-?) *His vision blurred and he saw double, causing him to look sick.*

Alicia: *She smiled at the stage and looked at Lance to ask him a question.* "L-Lance?" *She whispered and stared at him in shock.* "Are you okay?"

Lance: "Y-Yea-"

Alicia: "You're pale, sweating and-"

Lance: "Actually, no, I'm not OK-" *He quickly and silently stood up and ran outside the cinema-like area.*

Jester: "We begin our adventure with Karol-..."

Alicia: *She noticed the party watch the actors move on the stage, causing her to discreetly stand up and walk outside.* (What's wrong with him? Food poisoning?-)

Lance: *He sat on his knees and violently threw up in a small bin, sighing to himself in disorientation.* "Blah-" *He stood up and wiped his mouth in disgust.*

Alicia: "Lance-" *She stared at Lance's back, watching him lean on the side of a wall.*

Lance: "I-I don't feel too good." *He moaned with a child-like whine.*

Alicia: *She walked up to him and placed her hand on his back.* (His Neurons and Astragons-) *Her eyes widened and she gasped.*

Lance: "M-My powers are goin' away, ain't they?"

Alicia: *She hesitated to answer.* "Y-Yes."

Lance: "D-Damn."

Alicia: "Is that why you had that bothered look on your face before?"

Lance: "No."

Alicia: "Then what is it?"

Lance: "If this happens like Twotters, then.. I'm goin' to have to go home."

Alicia: *She paused and rubbed his back in confusion.* "..."

Lance: "S-Somethin' has been on my mind ever since I woke up after the fight."

Alicia: "Y-Yes?"

Lance: "I-..."

Alicia: "Lance?"

Lance: "I-I want you to come home with me, and be mine-"

Alicia: *She paused with widening eyes.* (Lance..)

Lance: "B-But, I completely understand if you want to stay here."

Alicia: "Stay here?"

Lance: "Aha-" *He sniffed with watering eyes.* "I don't really want to leave this place either.."

Alicia: "Why?"

Lance: "Lightning Blast?"

Alicia: "Tee hee.."

Lance: "But, seriously?"

Alicia: *She shook her head even though Lance couldn't see her.* "I made a promise."

Lance: "A promise?" *He thought to himself, triggering flashbacks of Alicia healing the sick.* "To look after someone here?"

Alicia: "No-"

Lance: "Or a Sacred Knight duty?"

Alicia: "No."

Lance: "Then wat?"

Alicia: ".. To never leave you."

Lance: *He paused with a dropping jaw and slowly turned around, facing Alicia with a smile.* "I love you."

Alicia: "I love you too."

Lance: "I want to kiss you right now, but I kinda just threw up, aye."

Alicia: "Gross, tee hee."

Lance: *He smiled into Alicia's eyes and his knees buckled.* "Arh-?"

Alicia: "N-No-" *She took a step forward in shock.*

Lance: "Gah-" *His eyes rolled back and he fell unconscious, collapsing onto the ground.*

Alicia: "Lance!" *She screamed and dropped to her knees over him.*

*Loud thuds followed by laughter came from inside the stage.*

Alicia: (Focus-) *Bright white rings materialised and spiralled around Lance.* "HEALING RINGS"

----------

Lance: "A-Ah." *He slowly opened his eyes with blurred vision.* "A-Alicia?"

Alicia: "R-Right here." *She watched Lance struggle to stand up, causing her to help him onto his feet.*

Lance: "Wat happened?"

Alicia: "Your body is reacting to the disappearance of Neurons and Astragons."

Lance: "Oh-"

Alicia: "You hit your head, but I healed it." *She held his hand with a worried look.*

*The doors behind Alicia slammed open as the party slowly walked out.*

Season: "Ah, Lance, Alicia, you both missed out on the performance."

Lance: "Missed out? It was a short play, aye. It mustn't have been a good adventure, aha."

Tyler: "A short play?"

Lance: "Yeah? It's only been like ten minutes."

Season: "Ten minutes? You've been gone for more than two hours."

Alicia: (His perception of time is fading.. That means he's almost run out of Astragons.)

Pepper: *She stepped forward, oblivious to the severity of Lance's condition.* "I say, we are asked to attend Silver Wind Island's castle on the next sunrise."

Lance: "Huh? Why?" *He coughed and stood up straight, causing Alicia to smile and step away.*

Season: *He shook his head.* "I don't know myself."

Lance: "I bet ya it's somethin' stupid, like givin' us a medal for all our hard efforts." *He sighed and rolled his eyes, trying not to keep the focus on himself.*

Holland: "I kind of agree with Lance."

PKMY: "Eh?"

Tyler: "How come?"

Holland: "Well, my memories are with you all. I don't need a little trophy to remind me of that."

Alicia: (He makes sense-)

PKMY: "Holly-" *She smirked and punched him on the shoulder.*

Lance: "So, outside the castle aye-" *He moaned and his eyes rolled back, causing him to lose consciousness.*

Teresa: "Lance?" *Her voice echoed faintly as if she was in a cave.*

Tyler: "W-What's wrong with him?" *His voice also echoed.*

Chapter 24: The Dontalia Facility

Lance: *He grunted and woke up on the floor with the party hovering over him.* "I passed out again?" *He grunted in a daze.*

Avocado: "L-Lemon."

Taco: "Taco says you are weak!" *She clapped her hands and stood in a pose.*

Pudding: *He/She grunted over Lance and stretched, showing off his/her muscles.* "Wat's up, tough stuff?"

Sausage: "Hohohohohohoh."

Hungry: "Taco? Hmmm." *He moaned with pleasure and dribbled on top of Lance.*

Lance: *He wiped the saliva string off his face in disgust.* "Wat the f-?!"

----------

Lance: *He moaned and gasped, slowly opening his eyes.* "Where-?" *He spoke faintly as if he hadn't used his voice in several days.*

Alicia: *She made noises as she slept on the side of Lance's bed.* "Zzzzz."

Lance: *He looked down and smiled at Alicia.* (I'll let her rest for a little bit-) *He relaxed and stared at the roof.*

PKMY: "And look who's awake!" *She stamped into the room, instantly waking Alicia up.*

Lance: "Tssk-"

Alicia: "PKMY-"

PKMY: "Heh, even after the play, you still mention everyone's name."

Lance: "Where am I?"

Alicia: "We're inside Surpreon's inn."

Lance: "Well, we ain't outside-" *He glanced around and leant up.* "It looks much fancier."

PKMY: "We're up pretty early, the sun has only just started to rise."

Lance: "Why didn't youse take me to the Silver Wind inn thingy?"

Alicia: "Because it was already full."

Lance: "Full?"

Alicia: "With the casualties from the fight in the city."

PKMY: "A lot of people weren't expecting hordes of those creatures to burst into the city."

Lance: "But that was ages ago."

PKMY: "They don't have a healer like us, and the only other healers available, are busy themselves."

Alicia: "A-And broken bones are hard to heal if you don't have the right feel to it."

Lance: "Feel to it?"

Alicia: "It's a healer thing."

Lance: "OK, I get it-"

PKMY: "We're actually pretty lucky to know two healers."

Lance: "Yea." *He smiled and looked at Alicia in appreciation.*

Teresa: *She walked into the room with Tyler and Season by her side.* "It would seem Alicia and Lance did not need a wake-up call."

Lance: "Wat's everyone doin', just bargin' into my room like this?"

Holland: "Barge into what?" *He mumbled and staggered in with Pepper.*

Lance: "Never mind." *He rolled his eyes.*

Season: "Please prepare yourselves with these ceremonial clothes." *He threw two sets of clothing on the bed.*

Lance: "Aye?" *He leant up, staring at the clothes in confusion.*

Alicia (Garments?) *She glanced at the party and noticed they all wore tight green silky-like clothes with gold stitching.* "You all look formal."

Holland: "It's too smooth for me." *He grunted with an uncomfortable frown as he tugged on the clothes.*

PKMY: "Heh." *She smirked at Holland.*

Pepper: "They remind me of Valhalla, yeah?"

Tyler: "I like them." *He smiled and rubbed the sleeves on his arms.*

Lance: "So, it's a ceremony apparently. Wat about?"

Season: "I was able to speak to Celest and Locki, but they weren't able to tell me much."

Pepper: "I say, what did they tell you? Not even Locki will tell me."

Lance: *He grabbed one of the green silky shirts and lifted it up to his chest.* "Umm, this won't fit me, it's like the size of my arm."

Season: "That's Alicia's-"

PKMY: "Idiot-"

Season: *He glanced at Pepper.* "He told me it will be a ceremony of announcements. So I've got one in mind myself."

Tyler: "What is it?" *He adjusted the RPG bag's strap, looking at Season in respect.*

Season: "I was also told not to tell anyone."

Tyler: "Oh? Okay."

Luna: *She walked into the room with Rachael and Lezard.* "Just wanted-"

Lance: "Did the room just get lamer?" *He moaned in a childish manner, discreetly glancing at Luna, Rachael and Lezard.*

Luna: *She frowned.* "Stupid-"

Rachael: "Luna?" *She grumbled at Luna and sighed at Lance.*

Lezard: "Ooo, the whole party is here! Hello, quickfingers, Lance, Season, PKMY, Holland and Tyler."

Luna: "Madora told us-" *She held her shoulder with one hand in a casual manner, glancing across the room.* "To tell all of you, that the ceremony is starting-"

Season: "That's right!"

Destiny: *She hovered from behind Luna, glancing at the party.* "Yeup."

Luna: "And to wait outside the glyph."

Alicia: "B-But, I'm not even dressed?" *Her tone had a hint of panic.*

Lezard: "Oh, silly sausage. No rush. We're just letting you know. Besides, one of the unusual requests was that we all went at the same time."

Season: "I understand, thank you."

Luna: "No rush?" *She looked at Lezard, annoyed.*

Rachael: "So don't make us wait." *She grunted with a sickly face and turned around, walking out the room.*

Luna: "Lezard." *She started to walk out of the room, causing Destiny to float after her.*

Lezard: *He nodded his head and hobbled out of the room.* "Wait for me, ladies."

Teresa: "If it has started, I believe we should allow them to get changed."

Season: "I agree."

Pepper: "Let's go, yeah?"

PKMY: "I'll be out in a sec, I just gotta check something." *She mumbled to the party and awkwardly paused, suddenly walking out the room.*

-

Luna: *She leant against the wall.* "I'll see yas back at Silver Wind Island."

Lezard: "Lezard is so confused? Why did we even need to come."

Luna: "Some people don't care if they go to the movies by themselves, but I always have a mate tag along if I'm goin' to the shops 'n' shit."

Lezard: "But we didn't go to the-"

Rachael: "We'll see you soon, Luna." *She wiped sweat off her forehead and walked out of the inn.*

-

Holland: (Amy? Did you feel that unusual nervous feeling?)

Freya: (Yes?) *Her voice echoed in Holland's mind.*

Holland: "Ah-" *He glanced at the party.* "I'll make sure PKMY isn't late. I'll see you all outside?"

Season: "Of course." *He watched Holland walk out of the room.*

Tyler: "Well-" *He smiled and started to walk out with the party.* "See you soon."

Alicia: "Thank you for checking up on us." *She smiled at Season, Teresa, Pepper and Tyler, watching them leave the room.*

Lance: "So-" *He awkwardly glanced at the clothes.*

Alicia: "If you turn around, I wouldn't mind getting changed here."

Lance: *His face slightly turned red.* "N-Nah, that's kool."

Holland: *He slowly walked down the hallway and smirked.* (No more creaking floorboards.)

Freya: (We sensed a strange feeling from PKMY and you're fascinated about the floor?)

Holland: (Oh don't be like that-) *He stopped in front of a closed door and knocked on it.*

PKMY: "I'm busy-" *She grunted in a stern manner, purposely being rude.*

Holland: "It's me." *He mumbled in a deep voice.*

PKMY: O-Oh." *She made Holland silently wait.* "Come in."

Holland: *He opened the door and walked into the room, noticing PKMY standing in front of a mirror.* "Hey, what's wrong?"

PKMY: "Nothing."

Holland: "Hey."

PKMY: "Just a little nervous I guess."

Holland: "You? Nervous?"

PKMY: "Heh-" *She smirked, staring at herself in the mirror.* "It's time for peace."

Holland: "So what are you getting it, no more fighting?"

PKMY: "There will always be fighting, but-" *She bent forward and smirked with a nervous expression on her face.*

Holland: "But what?" *He stepped forward, staring at PKMY's back in a worried manner.*

PKMY: "I couldn't fight even if I wanted to."

Holland: "Are.. Are you sick?"

PKMY: "No-"

Holland: "Then what's with the comment, I couldn't fight even if I wanted to?"

PKMY: "It's more like, I'm not allowed to fight."

Holland: *He raised an eyebrow and slowly shook his head in confusion.* "Amy, stop being so vague."

PKMY: "Well, I shouldn't have to be. What use of having a high ranked Scoldrant User if he can't sense it?!"

Holland: (I only sensed her vitals because I thought there was something wrong.) *He closed his eyes and concentrated.*

PKMY: (Nothing to say, that's what I thought-) *She continued to stare at herself in the mirror, discreetly waiting for Holland's reply.*

Holland: *Three heartbeats loudly echoed in his ear.* (There's nothing wrong, I don't know. Any ideas?)

Freya: (I don't sense anything wrong either, but I sense a mixture of emotions from her.)

Holland: (Yeah me too.)

Freya: (Maybe-) *She heard another heartbeat, causing her to stop in mid-sentence.*

Holland: (Freya?)

Freya: (Stop trying to sense for something negative.)

Holland: (What does that mean?)

Freya: (...)

Holland: "Ah, no.. She's being vague too." *He grunted to himself and sighed, opening his eyes in frustration.*

PKMY: "Freya?"

Holland: "Yeah." *He walked towards PKMY, oblivious to what's happening.* "If I've done something wrong-.."

*Holland spoke in a caring manner and gently grabbed PKMY's shoulder, spinning her around.*

PKMY: *She stared at Holland in a serious manner.* "N-No."

Holland: *He wrapped his arms around her and closed his eyes.* "I don't like it when we don't tell each other things-" *His arms instinctively twitched, causing him to look surprised.*

PKMY: "Eh?"

Holland: (What was that feeling?) *He looked at his arms in shock, filled with confusion.*

PKMY: "Holly?"

Holland: "I felt a heartbeat, but.. I don't know?"

PKMY: *A smile twitched on the corner of her mouth.* "O-Oh?"

Holland: *He inspected himself before staring into PKMY's eyes.* "Weird? It was like you had two heartbeats."

PKMY: "..." *She silently stared back into his eyes.*

Holland: *He chuckled and smiled.* "Maybe I am a bad Scoldrant User-" *He noticed PKMY's blank facial expression, causing his smile to slowly fade away.*

PKMY: "..." *She slowly looked down to Holland's chest and to the floor.*

Holland: (Two heartbeats? She's not allowed to fight-?) *He gasped with surprise and amazement.*

PKMY: "Heh." *She smirked.* (I sense his emotions-)

Holland: "Y-You're-?!" *He gently placed his hands on her stomach.*

PKMY: "Y-Yea." *She looked up and slowly nodded her head.*

Holland: "I don't believe it!-" *He quickly grabbed her around the waist and lifted her up before spinning around.*

PKMY: "Hehe."

Holland: *His face turned red with excitement.* "W-When did you find out?" *He gently placed PKMY on the floor, intensely staring at her.*

PKMY: "During Battling Oxident. I kept sensing another."

Holland: "W-Wow, how embarrassing." *He chuckled.*

PKMY: "What is?" *She smiled while tilting her head on a side in a curious manner.*

Holland: "Pretty bad how an empath and Scoldrant User didn't pick up on it sooner."

PKMY: "Yea-.." *She coughed and looked up.* "Rachael has a good soul, that was the reason why she didn't deliver that final killing blow. I'll ensure to be more careful with my body for now on-"

Holland: *He kissed her on the lips and chuckled in disbelief.* "I haven't been this happy since-"

Freya: *She looked up in the dark room and growled, causing a purple glyph to spiral in front of Holland.* "Gruff-"

PKMY: "H-Huh?" *She stepped back in shock as Freya jumped out of the glyph.* "Freya?"

Holland: (Since meeting Freya.)

Freya: (I'm happy!-) *Her body shrunk in size and she flapped her wings towards PKMY's face.* "Ruff-" *She hovered in the air, licking PKMY's nose.*

Holland: (My two little girls-) *He smirked and placed his hands behind his head.* (And another joy on its way.)

*Lance and Alicia adjusted their new garments and checked each other out, smiling in response.*

Lance: "You look great." *He smiled with blushing cheeks.*

Alicia: "Tee hee, thanks."

Lance: "Wait? Where's my compliment-?"

Alicia: "You look handsome!"

-

Luna: (I wonder if it'll work?)

Destiny: (That crystal! I remember it from your memories-) *She floated down and landed in Luna's arms.* (Was it what Arcadia and Kairi-?)

Luna: (Yes..) *She looked down and watched a green crystal materialise in her palm.* (I've been wantin' to talk to the shit nugget to see wat this is all about, aye.)

Destiny: (Its colour has changed..)

Luna: (It wasn't this vibrant before-) *She looked to the door.* (It's respondin' to his Newgongs too.)

Destiny: (So, she was right? Let's see if they're ready!)

Luna: "Aha, gettin' excited?"

Destiny: (It's your own emotion!) "Yeu!"

Luna: *She knocked on the door and brushed her fingers through Destiny's fur.* (Kool.. Kool..)

Destiny: (Why are you nervous?)

Luna: (I don't know, aye.. So you mind if we get some privacy?)

Destiny: "Yeup!" *She suddenly burst into silver liquid and spiralled into the glyph on the back of Luna's hand.*

Luna: (Thanks, Dest-)

-

Alicia: *She heard the knocks at the door, causing her to face it.* "W-We're dressed."

*Luna opened the door and casually walked into the room, catching Lance's attention.*

Lance: "Luna?"

Luna: "That's my name, Avocado."

Lance: "Aha."

Alicia: "We're not late, are we?"

Luna: "No. I actually wanted to talk to Lance."

Alicia: "Okay." *She stared at Luna who stared at her.*

Luna: "..."

Alicia: "O-Oh." *She whispered in realisation.* "I-I'll see you both outside." *She smiled at Lance and quickly kissed him on the cheek, before skipping out the room in a feminine manner.*

Lance: "Wat's up?" *He plunked himself on the side of the bed and looked down, tightening his shoelaces.*

Luna: "Don't ask any questions, but I was given a Rosterology item."

Lance: *He paused in thought as if he was expecting more.* "And?"

Luna: "Umm.."

Lance: "What is it?"

Luna: "I can only activate it with someone else."

Lance: "So?"

Luna: "And that person is you."

Lance: "Huh?" *He stopped doing his shoelaces and looked up, staring at Luna in confusion.* "O-K?"

Luna: *She walked up to Lance and sat on the bed next to him.* "So-" *She clicked her fingers, causing a green crystal to appear in her palm.*

Lance: "Hey, isn't that one of them Crystalline Membrane or Blossom things?"

Luna: "What?" *She glanced at Lance in shock as if she was surprised he was correct.*

Lance: "Yea, sometimes I know what I'm actually talkin' about."

Luna: *She smiled in a serious manner and glanced at the crystal.* "They're usually blue or red. This one is green."

Lance: "Why?"

Luna: "Because it's special."

Lance: "Explain?"

Luna: "It was a parting gift." *She mumbled.* "It's also a Summonce Scarbra."

Lance: "A wat-?"

Luna: *She shook her head and held the crystal on one end, leaving room for Lance to grab the other.* "Shut up."

Lance: "Also, where's your floatin' fleabag?"

Luna: "I wanted this to be an us thing."

Lance: "Aye?"

Luna: "Just touch the damn crystal." *She grunted in an annoyed manner.*

Lance: *He rolled his eyes and touched the other end of the crystal.* "So-?" *He looked around the room.* "Is somethin' meant to happen?"

Luna: *She paused in confusion, glancing across the room in disappointment.* "Maybe it doesn't work?"

Lance: "Oh well, it was a dud. No biggie-"

Luna: "It has to.. It was important."

Lance: *He noticed Luna's seriousness, causing him to look down in a mature manner.* "Or maybe, it's 'cause I'm losin' my-"

*Strings of green light swirled out of the crystal, forming small white orbs.*

Luna: (It's workin'-?!)

*The orbs of light slowly merged in front of Lance and Luna, causing them to stand up in shock.*

?????: "Please don't be frightened-" *A man's voice echoed from the clustering light, as it slowly took shape of a man.*

Lance: "Say that to the talkin' light." *He raised his arm and clicked his fingers, causing a small spark of electricity to flash.*

Luna: *She glanced at Lance and sighed.* "Tryin' to fight someone with the spark of a lighter?" *She taunted and raised her arm, readying herself to fight.*

Lance: *He glanced at his hand, twitching his fingers in disappointment.* (Damn-)

Luna: "If you want me to fight, then just say so-" *She clicked her fingers and electricity streamed around her hand, forming into a bow.*

?????: "Luna, Lance. Sit back down." *The light's brightness started to fade, revealing the man's identity.*

Luna: *Her jaw dropped in shock, as the lightning around her hand stringed away.* "C-Can't be-"
Lance: *He froze in shock, intensely staring at the man in disbelief.* "D-Dad?"

Luna: "D-Daddy?"

Leon: *He smiled and stepped forward, waving the light's faint residue out of his face.* "It's great to see you two."

Luna: *She covered her mouth with both hands, quietly squealing to herself.* (It can't be-)
Lance: *His eyes watered, as he continued to stand frozen.* "H-How? You can't be here-"

Leon: *He waved his hand downwards, causing Luna and Lance to obediently sit back down.* "When you both made a reappearance, traces of my faint Astragons were attracted to your fading Neurons."

Lance: "Reappearance? Newgongs, Astragongs?" *He shook his head in confusion.*

Arcadia: (If my hypothesis of that device is unintentionally acting as a conduit, thy would highly encourage to view it in private with him.) *Her voice echoed in Luna's mind.*

Luna: "Pretty much means, he came back to this world when we did."

Lance: "O-Oh-"

Leon: "Only someone with the right sense in power could know how to do this."

Luna: "..." *She silently nodded her head.*

Lance: "I don't-.." *He smirked and stood up.* "I don't believe it."

Luna: *She exhaled with a growing smile.* (Me neither-)

Lance: *He shook his head with emotion and suddenly ran towards Leon.* "I-I can't tell if this is real-"

Luna: (I'm shocked we brought his Astral Projection back with us from mum's crystal thingy.)

Lance: "You're just like how I remember!" *He spread his arms, readying to hug Leon.*

*Lance ran straight through Leon and fell to the floor, grunting with emotional pain.*

Lance: "H-Huh?" *He quickly looked over his shoulder and noticed orbs of white light spiralling back to Leon's disfigured entity.*

Luna: "He's an Astral Projection, Lance-"

Lance: "Oh-"

Leon: "Please sit down-" *He stepped to the side, watching Lance stand back up.*

Lance: (But still. This is so surreal.) *He thought to himself as he slowly walked back to the bed.*

Leon: "I'm sure you might have many questions."

Lance: "Heaps-"

Luna: "Not really."

Lance: "Aye?"

Luna: "Mum actually told me a lot."

Lance: (She did-?)

Luna: "But, probably like you, I had to leave in a rush."

Lance: "Yea."

Luna: "I probably won't be able to go back to Dee Highs, so I wanna know.." *She mumbled to herself, looking down to her lap.*

Leon: "Yes, my darling?"

Luna: (Darling..?) *She whispered in thought as if she wasn't used to being called that.*

Lance: *He stared at Leon, trying to contain his excitement.* (Dad.. He's really here-)

Leon: "Luna?"

Luna: "Umm-" *She looked back up.* "How did you get to Earth? Dee Highs..."

Lance: "Yea." *He wiggled his bottom on the bed, eagerly awaiting Leon's response.*

Leon: "Well, it'll be quite the story?"

Luna: "We don't care, aye!"
Lance: "Just tell us already!" *They shouted with excitement.*

Leon: "OK." *He chuckled and waved his hand across Luna and Lance, causing the green crystal in their hands to glow.* (It still works!)

Lance and Luna: "Wha-?" *They stared at the crystal in shock, triggering a flashback.*

--

*A woman in pink armour flew through a flowery meadow, leaving a swirling trail of yellow petals behind her.*

?????: "Celestiana! Wait up!" *He shouted with a loss of breath, catching her attention.*

Celest: *She smiled and looked over her shoulder, slowing down her flying speed.* "Leon, make haste."

Leon: "The air is thinner up here!" *He ran up to Celest and smirked, placing his hands on his knees.*

Celest: "Hermph. You're one of the few wingless beings to step foot here-"

Leon: "Exactly! Give me some rest!-" *He grunted with a smirk and pointed behind her, drawing Celest's attention to a platform of floating islands.*

Celest: "I see." *She smirked and floated down, stepping onto the island.* "We're almost at The Divine Path."

Leon: "Aha. You're eager, ain't ya?"

Celest: *She smirked and faced away, staring at clouds in the far distance.* "It will be my first mission to leave Valhalla since it was raised."

--

Lance: "Wait? You talked like us?"

Leon: "Haha. No."

Luna: "But-?"

Leon: "You talk like me." *He smirked, causing Luna and Lance to chuckle.*

Lance: "You were in Valhalla."

Leon: "Looks like it."

Lance: "And you know that crazy Celest chick."

Leon: "Haha."

Lance: "You looked around my age.."

Leon: *He nodded his head as if Lance was right.* "Sure was."

Lance: "But Celest.. She only looks a few years younger than she does now, aye."

Leon: "It's all about Astragons."

Lance: "We can make ourselves look young?"

Leon: "Not look young. But stay young."

Lance: "Then wat do Newgongs do?"

Leon: "If you focus the Neurons on your body like you do with Astragons, then you'd never get sick and excel in physical attributes."

Lance: "Kool."

Luna: "C'mon, you didn't know that?" *She sounded displeased.*

Lance: "Well, I didn't have a father to tell me that shit."

Luna: *She shook her head with a smirk, focusing her attention back on Leon.* "Just exactly how old are you?"

Leon: "Much older than it said on my driver's license."

Lance: "Aha." *He chuckled in excitement as if he was just happy talking to Leon.*

Luna: "Were you from Valhalla?"

Leon: *He shook his head, slightly hovering in the air.* "No. I was an Elementalist."

Luna and Lance: "Awesome."

Lance: "So, you're playin' tag with Celest. Wat's happenin'?"

Leon: "I was actually pretty high up in the ranks."

Luna: "Wind or lightning?" *She smirked, eagerly waiting for Leon's response.*

Lance: "Aye?"

Leon: "Lightning."

Luna: "That means-"

Leon: "So. Our mission was to ensure the six Unknown Territories were running at optimum levels."

Lance: "Six? There're five."

Leon: *He shook his head.* "There's six."

Lance: "Nah, they're called, the five Unknown Territories."

Luna: "Wasn't it curries?"

Leon: *He momentarily glanced at Luna with a confused smirk.* "There's five containing the teleportation glyphs. The sixth acts like a control panel or security system."

Lance: *He shrugged his shoulders as if he didn't care.* "Kool."

Luna: "Fairo."

Lance: "Was there a reason why you were checkin' on them?"

Leon: *He nodded his head, looking up in recollection.* "Each on The Unknown Territories is heavily affected by the environment around them. As Elementalists, we felt a disturbance in such."

--

*Leon and Celest skilfully ran above the treetops of an enormous mountain, admiring the scenery around them.*

Celest: "How does it feel to have the strongest lightning of your generation?"

Leon: "It's good.."

Celest: "Your manipulation abilities are unrivalled. No mortal has been able to block your lightning."

Leon: "Well, how does it feel to hold the power of Radiatons? No mortal has been able to fully copy its abilities."

Celest: *She chuckled, nodding her head.* "I have to confess."

Leon: "Aye?"

Celest: "I've been monitoring you, my old friend."

Leon: "And?"

Celest: "If you don't mind me prying. Why don't you find a partner?"

Leon: "Pssht-" *He jumped across several thin branches, causing only the leaves to sway in his presence.* "Let's focus on gathering the two other party members and reach the last Unknown Territory."

Celest: "Indeed." *She suddenly disappeared in a flash of white light, causing Leon to squint his eyes.*

Leon: "Heh-" *He bent his knees, flashstepping out of the area.*

--

Lance: "There're another two party members?"

Leon: "Yes. This may not seem like it, but it was an important mission."

Luna: *She touched her stomach, causing her to smirk.* (I'm gettin' butterflies. It's amazin' actually bein' inside the memories-)

--

Leon: *He flashstepped onto the shore of a cloudy beach, instantly noticing Celest by his side.* "Beat me again."

Celest: "I don't know why you try? Teleportation is far superior to flashstepping."

Leon: "Heh." *He smirked, folding his arms in a child-like manner.*

Celest: "So-" *She stared across the ocean, causing her eyes to shine golden.* "The Sacred Waters."

Leon: *He nodded his head, glancing across the beach.* "Well, we can't get there without-"

*An enormous stingray emerged from the water, revealing two people standing on its back.*

Leon: (Whoa, it's huge-)

Celest: "Ernest. It's been a long time."

--

Lance: "Ernest? Alicia told me everythin' about the fourth Unknown Territory. She told me he was kinda old lookin'?"

Luna: "Your point?"

Lance: "He looks pretty young."

Ernest: "This happened a long time ago, remember, the driver's license comment?" *He spoke with a confused smile as if it was obvious.*

Luna: "You ask some stupid stuff, big bro."

Lance: "That's doctor professor big bro to you."

*Leon and Luna rolled their eyes at Lance, hiding their smirk.*

--

Ernest: *He smiled at Celest, causing the stingray to float closer to the shore.* "Celest. Locki?"

Leon: "Nah, Leon."

?????: "Who're these fools?" *She grunted, folding her arms.*

Ernest: "Kairi! That's Celest, a celestial being and Leon, one of the strongest Elementalists of our generation."

Kairi: "Cool. I'll give 'em an award, hey." *She spoke in disrespect, looking at her nails without care.*

--

Lance: "Holy shit. Was that our mother?!"

Luna: "Aha! I reckon!"

Leon: "Language."

Lance: "A-Ah-" *He leant back surprised, slowly nodding his head.* "My bad."

Leon: "The Sacred Waters, The Sandy Tomb and The Dontalia Facility were the hardest Unknown Territories to check up on." *He smirked to himself, speaking from recollection.*

Luna: (The Dontalia what?)

--

*Ernest, Kairi, Leon and Celest stood on the stingray's back, facing each other.*

Leon: "How are we meant to get there? I heard it's deep in the ocean-"

Kairi: "Pfft-" *She rolled her eyes at Leon and swayed her arms, causing a swirl of wind to cut the water around them.* "AIR SWIRL"

Ernest: "Bryza, submerge."

Bryza: "Errrwow." *He echoed like a whale and submerged into the water, causing a swirl of wind to push the water back.*

Kairi: *She continuously waved her arms, causing a sphere-like bubble to keep the water from touching the stingray's back.* "AIR SWIRL"

Celest: "Like thou, Leon, Kairi has a remarkable endurance or stamina when it comes to Remenistal."

Leon: *He unintentionally snarled in disgust.* "A Remenistal User?"

Kairi: "An Elementalist?" *She purposely spoke like an idiot as she concentrated on her arm's movement.*

Celest: "Thou must put your beliefs aside and work together."

Ernest: "I agree. We have no idea which Unknown Territory is causing the environmental problem."

Leon: "Whatever."

Bryza: "Errrwow."

Ernest: *He looked down, nodding his head.* "Thank you, Bryza." *He glanced at the party.* "We're almost there."

--

Lance: "This is pretty kool. We went on a similar adventure, aye."

Luna: "I can't believe that was mum.."

Lance: "Yea. You two act completely different."

Leon: "Once you have children, you'll understand that you have to grow up, sometimes unintentionally, in a way to be a good role model."

Lance: "..."

Luna: "Either way, can ya skip to the part where you're in the territory?"

Leon: "Haha, alright."

--

Ernest: *He reached up and pulled Kairi through the glass, watching it ripple around her.* "There we are."

Leon: *He observed the glass in amazement.* "This reminds me of the small cities that responds to the dancers and singers."

Kairi: *She stepped on metallic rails, rolling her eyes at Leon.* "Good for you."

Leon: *He frowned at Kairi's attitude.* "You know, all you Remenistal Users are the same."

Kairi: "Oh?"

Leon: "Always up yourselves. Abusing your power for your own satisfaction-"

Kairi: "Oh?! Says the Elementalist! You guys think you're better than us! We needed your help and you never showed up!"

Leon: "Don't be stupid, aye-"

Kairi: "Stupid?! Your ignorance caused half of the village's population to die!"

Leon: "Last time I gathered, it was forbidden to talk to your kind! This rule was created by your own village."

Celest: *She suddenly teleported on a nearby platform, catching the party's attention.* "The throne room is open. Come."

Ernest: (Awkward..) *He walked down the metallic floor, causing it to echo several times.* (I felt like a numpty just standing there-)

Kairi: "Just, don't talk to me." *She grunted and stormed down the path, following Ernest.*

Leon: *He stared at Kairi in an annoyed manner.* (How rude. Blaming me for something I didn't even do. She's so-, hot-headed.) *He unintentionally smiled with his frown, slowly walking down the path.*

--

Luna: "What's with the unusual party members?"

Leon: "The four of us actually have a role in this."

Lance: "Aye?"

Leon: "Celest, for her Radiatons."

Luna: "What does that mean?"

Leon: "She's able to bypass all security protocols."

Lance: "Kool."

Leon: "Ernest, for his knowledge in the Unknown Territories, and his ability to communicate with nearby Scoldrants."

Lance: "I like Holland better." *He folded his arms like a child, causing Luna to roll her eyes with a chuckle.*

Luna: "Blake is where it's at."

Leon: "Lastly, Kairi and I, for our strong abilities of opposites."

Lance: "What does that mean?"

Leon: "If we happen to go into a Purity Zone, I would then have to step it up. Or, if we go through Spacial Funnels or Reality Sekais, then Kairi would have to step it up-"

Lance: "Wait, wait wait, hold on. What's this about Spacial Funnels?"

Leon: "Not many people know. But, as an Elementalist, it takes us a while to properly use our power just after stepping through warped Astragons."

Luna: "While Rostical Users don't?"

Leon: "Yes."

Lance: (That's kool. Covering each other's weaknesses.) "But, I don't experience this weakness?"

Luna: "Me neither, aye?"

Leon: "Because you two are special."

Luna: "..." *She looked down, smiling in appreciation.* "Thanks-"

Lance: "Huh? I know Luna is, but I'm not special."

Luna: "He didn't mean it like that, he meant, unique."

Lance: "Oh.."

*Leon and Luna face palmed at Lance, causing the three of them to chuckle.*

Luna: "So, when do you and mum get together?"

Lance: "Ewww."

Luna: "Well, she's the birth-giver, right?"

Leon: "Haha. Well-"

--

Ernest: *He observed the glyphic markings on the walls, causing him to face Celest.* "Whatever is causing these problems. It's not The Sacred Waters."

Celest: "Excellent." *She glanced at Kairi and Leon before focusing her attention back to Ernest.* "Where to now?"

Ernest: "We should check The Unknown Island, Unknown Forest, and The Sandy Tombs, as their architectural structure is similar."

Celest: "Excellent."

Leon: *He looked to his side and watched Kairi stare through the glass.* "Let's go."

Kairi: *She watched the sea-like Scoldrants swim through the water, smiling deep in thought.* "..."

Leon: "Tssk-" *He walked towards Kairi, stopping by her side.* "Oi?"

Kairi: "Sometimes I think to myself, it would be good to just be a Scoldrant."

Leon: "Hey?"

Kairi: "You don't have to worry about things. Just moving peacefully, only to worry about family and-"

Leon: "And-?" *He smiled as if he wasn't expecting her to talk like that.*

Kairi: *She gasped in realisation, quickly frowning at Leon.* "Nothing important." *She grunted and walked towards Celest.*

Leon: (Ha.) *He watched the fish-like Scoldrants swim past the naturally lit water.* (Someone like her, thinking about something like that.. She's different to the other Remenistal Users I've met-)

Celest: *She cupped her hands, watching a large purple glyph form itself on the ground.* "Let's go, Leon."

Leon: *He quickly turned around, nodding his head.* "Right!"

--

Luna: "Naww, dad has the hots for mum."

Leon and Lance: "Obviously."

Luna, Leon and Lance: "Ahaha!"

Lance: (Nothin' exciting has happened yet.. But, this is truly awesome..) "Where did yas go next?"

Leon: "The Unknown Island. Nothing worth mentioning happens, so I'll skip past the details-"

--

Celest: *She stood in the throne room, staring at five glyphs on the wall.* "Well?"

Ernest: "The Unknown Island is also clear from any abnormalities."

Leon: "Can I ask you a question?"

Kairi: "Make it quick." *She hissed under her breath, prompting Leon to talk.*

Leon: "I've actually thought about what you said earlier."

Kairi: "Huh?"

Leon: "About the life of a Scoldrant."

Kairi: "Please..." *She sounded unconvinced, looking away in disrespect.*

Leon: "Unlike us, they don't discriminate, they don't care what they look like. And, some care more about others, than themselves."

Kairi: *She looked surprised, hiding her dropping jaw.* "Are you insulting me?"

Leon: "N-No-?"

Kairi: "Shut up." *She frowned and stormed to the other side of the room.*

Leon: "Oh, and they aren't a stubborn rude bitch either." *He smirked in a frustrated manner.*

Kairi: *She quickly turned around and crossed her arms, standing in a battle-ready pose.* "You want a go?"

Leon: "Nah." *He purposely turned away.*

Ernest: "We're good to go."

Celest: "Excellent. The Unknown Forest, then to The Runic Chambers." *She spoke with a loss of focus as another purple glyph drew itself on the ground.*

--

Luna: "Aha, there's the Lighten anger."

Leon: "Haha, I wouldn't say anger."

Luna: "You wouldn't? I've been told I've got anger problems."

Leon: "I just believe our tolerance to bullshit is lower than normal people."

Luna: "Aha, I like it!"

Lance: (That island thingy.. I remember it bein' old 'n' stuff, so it was kool seein' it all new lookin'. I know it's a memory, but it feels like time-travel a little bit.)

Luna: "Oh, by the way."

Leon: "Yes, my little angel?"

Luna: "Pssht." *She smiled.* "Some Scoldrants do discriminate and can be quite mean to their other members."

Leon: "Really?"

Luna: "Yup! It's actually how I met Destiny."

Lance: "Next?" *He spoke as if he didn't care.*

--

Ernest: *He walked out of the ruin-like entrance, stepping on soft vegetation.* "Everything seemed fine here too."

Celest: "How intriguing."

Kairi: "Knowing our luck, we'll probably find whatever the problem is on the last destination."

Ernest: *He nodded his head with a smile.* "Yes."

Celest: (Thy fear our problem rests at The Dontalia Facility.)

Kairi: *She waved her hand, causing all the leaves which littered the ground to blow into the air.* "I wonder what is causing a disturbance in the environment?"

Leon: "This disturbance. It feels like, someone purposely whooshing the water on a flat lake."

Kairi: "Please."

Ernest: "No, no. He's right." *He smiled, nodding his head in an impressed manner.* "I can confirm this through the Scoldrants."

Kairi: "Really?"

Ernest: *He nodded his head again.* "It's unrelated to this yellow eye condition, but-.. I just don't know."

Kairi: "If it is important enough for the caretaker of an Unknown Territory, a Celestial being, and even an Elementalist.. Then, whatever it is-"

Celest: "Will need to be slain."

Kairi: "But-?"

Ernest: "Even I agree to this, and I'm a Scoldrant User."

Leon: "How do you know it's a Scoldrant?"

Ernest: "We don't-"

Celest: "But, no mere mortal can access these territories."

Kairi: "Because of the natural disasters around them?"

Celest: "Yes.."

Leon: (I'm actually a little worried..)

Kairi: (Then, what could it be?)

Leon: *He placed his hands on the back of his hand, looking at Celest.* "Celestiana?"

Celest: "Power of the forbidden spirits, come to my command, with seraphic powers, TELEPORTATION" *She shouted, causing a bright purple flash to blind the party members.*

--

Lance: "Ooo, a story."

Luna: "Aha, you've been hangin' around Lezard too much."

Lance: "Pssht.."

Luna: "Loser."

Lance: "Butt nugget."

Luna: "Eww, change your pants then!"

Leon: *He smiled at his children, causing him to unintentionally form a fist.* (I regret not being able to watch my family grow up..-)

Lance: "So, what happens next?" *He smiled at Leon while pulling on Luna's hair.*

Luna: "Yes, dad." *She smiled, pinching Lance's nipples in an aggressive manner.*

Leon: "We're on our way to The Sandy Tombs."

--

Kairi: "Gahhh-" *She moaned and leant against the orange wall, ignoring her dripping sweat.*

Celest: "Thy agree. How long remaining?"

Ernest: *He carefully inspected the glyphs on the wall and stepped back, shaking his head.* "It's all clear here."

Kairi: *She glanced at Leon, smirking in a bitchy-like manner.* "So, how many people did you let die by ignorantly ignoring them?"

Leon: "Oh? How many people did you kill by aggressively using your Remenistal powers?"

Ernest: *He glanced at Leon and Kairi, causing him to look at Celest.* "Shouldn't we-?"

Celest: "No. Until we face a threat, allow them to get to know each other."

Ernest: "But, they look like numptys just arguing-?"

Celest: "Did we not clash on our first meeting?"

Ernest: "Why, yes."

Kairi: *She frowned, wiping sweat off her forehead.* "Celest, Ernest, was it wise sending us both together? It's forbidden for us to speak-"

Celest: "This mission far outweighs some petty feud your kind has!" *She shouted with an echoing voice, causing the walls to vibrate.*

Ernest: (Wow-) *He slightly stepped away from Celest, watching sand stream down the ceiling.*

Celest: "Elementalists and Rostical Users are cousins! Stop acting like such commoners and grow up."

Leon: "Pssht."
Kairi: "Tssk-"

--

Lance: "It's so weird seein' your parents young like you, aye?"

Luna: "Yeah.. It kinda makes you wonder if we'll one day act like that, too?"

Lance: "When we're old farts makin' tea outside on a patio?"

Luna: "Yea?"

Lance: "Wanna biscuit?"

Luna: "Skim milk?"

Lance: "..."

Luna: "..."

*Lance and Luna suddenly burst into laughter, causing Leon to silently smile at them.*

Lance: "No way. I'm goin' to be the best old fart out."

Luna: "Nah, you'll be like, hey kiddies, want some of my cookies and milk?"

Lance: "Wat the-?! Not even!"

Leon: "So-" *He spoke in a relaxed tone, causing Luna and Lance to instantly stop their immature behaviour.*

Luna: "The next Unknown Territory?"

Leon: "Yes. I still remember all the traps and several Reality Sekais this Unknown Territory had."

Lance: "It was pretty crazy."

Luna: "Yea.. We blew it up."

Lance: "Huh? Like, after I was in there?"

Luna: "I dunno?"

Leon: (They've even been in The Unknown Territories.) *He thought to himself with a smile.* "Luckily Celest was there and bypassed all these traps with her eyes."

--

Leon: "The Runic Chambers." *He spoke in wonder, watching aura-based stairs move on their own accord.*

Kairi: "Why do we have to wait outside?"

Leon: "It's what Celestiana wanted."

Kairi: "She probably put you in time out."

Leon: "And by puttin' you outside too? Aha, sure."

Kairi: "Do you have to annoy me?"

Leon: "It's a shame. You only have your looks and Remenistal power going for you.. The rest is very unappealing."

Kairi: *She looked shocked and suddenly frowned in anger.* "My thoughts about you exactly!"

Leon: "Thanks, I do work out." *He smirked in appreciation, looking away in a child-like manner.*

Kairi: "Grrr!" *She grunted in anger, causing her hair to swirl to each side.*

Leon: *He felt the wind blow around him, causing him to look at Kairi.* "Settle down. I don't want to fight you."

Kairi: "I may not look it, but I'm really strong."

Leon: "OK."

Kairi: "Scared?" *She faced Leon, smirking in an aggressive manner.*

Leon: "Nope."

Kairi: "I think it's pathetic when a guy is afraid to fight a woman."

Leon: "That's not it."

Kairi: "What's also pathetic-" *She tightened her fingers, causing the wind's swirl to strengthen.* "Is when someone has a stronger tongue than their fist."

Leon: "And what's pathetic, is someone seeking a fight over mere words."

Kairi: "..." *She stared at Leon as if she was unsure how to respond.*

Leon: "Now, put that wind away, or someone is goin' to think we farted."

Kairi: "F-Farted?" *She frowned with a confused smirk, causing the wind around her to die down.*

*Celest and Ernest suddenly appeared in a flash of purple light, catching Kairi and Leon's attention.*

Ernest: "Everything is clear here."

Celest: "Kairi, thou must be an Astraseeker."

Kairi: "Sorry?" *She faced Celest, hiding her heated facial expression.*

Celest: "We were required to go to all six destinations."

Kairi: "Heh." *She smirked, walking towards the glowing glyph.*

Leon: "I personally don't mind."

Kairi: "Because you're lazy?"

Leon: "No. Because it's kool seeing all these sanctums."

Ernest: "Ah, someone else who respects these facilities." *He smiled at Leon, watching him walk towards the glyph.*

Kairi: "Lame." *She spoke under her breath as a flash of purple light blinded her.*

--

Lance: "Was the relationship between Elementalist and Rostickal Users that bad?"

Leon: "Unfortunately."

Luna: "Why?"

Leon: "From what I observed, it's something stupid like racial barriers."

Lance: "Really?"

Leon: "Luckily, we have the ability to evolve.. From what I've gathered, this feud no longer applies."

Luna: "That's because there is hardly any Elementalists remainin'."

Leon: "But still."

Lance: "So, is this leadin' up to something?"

Leon: "Yes-"

Luna: "Is it a bad guy? In Lance's stupid movies, there's always a scientist gone mad, ya know?"

Lance: "Stop goin' through my movies!"

Leon: "Actually, something worse."

Luna and Lance: "Aye?"

Leon: "It was so strong, we couldn't beat it."

Luna and Lance: "Aye?" *They both leant forward, giving Leon all their attention.*

--

*Celest, Ernest, Leon and Kairi appeared outside a massive silver facility, surrounded by a warping bubble.*

Celest: *She stared at the entrance to the facility, gritting her teeth in frustration.* (This is just as thy've feared.. The Wise.. We should summon The Sacred Knights to do this..-)

Leon: *He looked behind him, staring at the warping air.* "We're inside a Reality Sekai?"

Celest: "Don't worry. We teleported inside it, not through it."

Leon: *He raised his hand, discreetly watching green lightning string around his fingers.* "Kool."

Ernest: (What is this place?)

Kairi: "Where are we?"

Celest: "We're on a floating island.. Secluded from the outside world."

Leon: "So, we're in Valhalla?"

Celest: "No..."

Ernest: "Not even I know much about this place.. Care to share some information-?"

Celest: "Negative.."

Ernest: "Sorry?"

Kairi: "You expect us to work with you, but don't tell us anything?"

Leon: 'I'm surprised to find myself agreeing with the Remenistal User."

Celest: *She closed her eyes as if she was contemplating something.* "..."

Ernest: "Celest?"

Celest: *She opened her eyes, glaring at Ernest in a serious manner.* "Thy have one important thing to ask of thou, Ernest."

Ernest: "Yes?"

Celest: "Do not try to communicate with any living thing."

Ernest: "I'm sorry, but I already tried-"

Celest: "Thou what?!" *She shouted in an urgent manner, causing the party to look at her in confusion.*

Ernest: "Don't worry. I can't sense any living things around here."

Celest: "Hmm?" (Perhaps it's the structure's defences?)

Leon: "What aren't you tellin' us?"

Kairi: "I get the feeling you might know what's been happening.."

Celest: *She stormed up to the door and closed her eyes, causing a wave of light to open the door.* "Be on guard.."

Ernest: *He watched the door slide in four different ways, causing him to gasp in shock.* "What the-?"

Leon: "The door? It made a sheeshh noise?"

Ernest: "Despite, what numpty over here said, I've never seen this type of behaviour to a door opening either.."

Celest: "Move along.." *She spoke in a professional manner, stepping inside the facility.*

--

Lance: "Awesome. We get to see the sixth thingy."

Luna: "That door, it was like somethin' from-"

Lance: "One of my movies, got it.."

Luna: "Yea. It actually looks like a spaceship."

Lance: "Hey, it kinda did."

Leon: "Wait until you see the inside.."

--

Celest: *She watched another set of doors slide open in four different ways, causing a pulse of cold air to swirl in front of her.* "Here-"

Ernest: (I'm getting a weird feeling in here..)

Kairi: "It's dark.."

Leon: "Really?"

Celest: *She stepped inside the poorly lit room, glancing to each side in a curious manner.* "It appears the system's automatic sensors are offline."

Leon: "Sensors? Offline? What are you talking about?"

Kairi: *She stepped forward, causing her to look down to her feet.* "The floor feels strange? What kind of material is this?"

Celest: "Leon, if you mind providing light?"

Leon: "Right-" *He raised his arm, causing a loop-like string of green lightning to flash above the party.*

Kairi: *She stared at the lightning and looked away, squinting her eyes.* (It's bright.)

Ernest: *He watched the green lightning effectively light up the surrounding area, causing the floor to glimmer.* "Fascinating.."

Kairi: "The floor looks similar to The Library's in design."

Celest: "The access panel should be on the other side of the room."

Leon: "What's this called again?"

Celest: "The Dontalia Facility." *She walked down the room, causing the party to follow.*

Ernest: "Celest.. I know a lot about the Unknown Territories, so why isn't there any data on this?"

Celest: "Because-" *She stopped at the wall and placed her hand on a square, causing lights to many machines to activate.*

*The ceiling and floor lights turned on, causing the party to squint their eyes.*

Leon: *He lowered his arm, causing the lightning to flash away.* "Wow..."

Kairi: "I've..." *She spoke under her breath, glancing across the room.* "Everything is made of Rosterology devices?"

Ernest: "Everything is too.. Artificial?" *He shrugged his shoulders as if he couldn't explain what he meant.*

Leon: *He watched different machines light up different colours, listening to their operating-like hum.* "You need to explain yourself, Celestiana."

Celest: *She sighed as if she had no other choice but to explain.* "When thy was very young, there were members of an old group."

Kairi: "An old group to what?"

Celest: "The Wise.."

Ernest: "It's fine.. You can tell us."

Celest: *She hesitantly exhaled, looking at each party member.* "Their intentions were good, but their actions weren't.."

Kairi: "What did they do?"

Celest: "They wanted to spread the power of Radiatons to non-celestial beings."

Ernest: "That's amazing. How could their actions be in the wrong?"

Kairi: "W-Wow.." *She spoke in amazement and listened to music which suddenly started to play in the background.*

Leon: "That music.. It's not divine or holy.."

Ernest: "Blargh.." *He covered his ears in disgust.* "Even the music sounds artificial."

Celest: "But, to do this-" *She turned around and stepped forward, causing another door to slide open in four different ways.* "They had to experiment on people."

Kairi and Leon: "That's disgusting!" *They spoke at the same time, causing them to awkwardly look at each other in shock.*

Ernest: (I think I see where this is going.)

Celest: "Once the other members of The Wise heard about this. It was quickly shut down and the other members were banished."

Ernest: "Is that why it was sealed?"

Leon: "Sealed?"

Ernest: "You really are a numpty.. This Reality Sekai, how everything was turned off.. It's quite obvious."

Leon: "I.."

Kairi: "In the numpty's defence, the three of us didn't know what this place was."

Leon: *He discreetly smiled at Kairi, nodding his head in agreement.* "Yea."

Celest: "Enough bickering. We must head to the facility's throne room."

Ernest: "A throne room. At least there's something I actually recognise in this place."

Celest: "Come." *She stepped into the doorway and faced the party, standing in an elevator-like complex.*

*Leon, Kairi and Ernest hesitantly walked into the small room, observing it in a cautious manner.*

--

Lance: "Holy butt nuggets! It's all futuristic 'n' stuff."

Luna: "Somethin' like that, in this world.. It just seems out of place."

Lance: "I know. There have been some places where it looked a little futuristic, but it still had the fantasy magic feelin'-"

Luna: "I know exactly what you mean."

Lance: "But this dentist facility place, it felt completely spacey."

Luna: "Like even you said, dad, the music sounded nerdy too."

Leon: *He nodded his head, triggering another flashback.* "It gets even stranger."

--

*Celest, Kairi, Leon and Ernest stepped onto the next floor, watching the elevator doors close behind them.*

Celest: "And this-" *She spread her arms, drawing the party's attention to human-sized test tubes along each side of the wall.* "-Is their work."

Kairi: *She covered her mouth, watching organic balls float inside the bubbling test tubes.* "What is-?"

Celest: "Their research wasn't only limited to humanoid specimens."

Ernest: (These organs.. They're Scoldrants!-) "Repulsive."

Celest: "As thou can see. This facility is where our Rosterology development advanced to the next stage."

Leon: "If this was already so advanced back when you were younger, how come villages or cities don't look like this?"

Celest: "Because, after discovering this.. We decided to continue our survival on Astragons, Neurons and Radiatons. We chose not to take this evolutionary step."

Kairi: "This is a lot to take in."

Ernest: "You're telling me. I thought I knew all there was about The Unknown Territories."

Celest: "Of course, only thyself and several members of The Wise know about this."

Leon: "..." *He wandered off, observing the room in a child-like manner.*

Kairi: "The Sandy Tombs used to be my least favourite.."

Leon: "Oi!" *He stared at the ground, causing the party to walk towards him.*

Celest: "Did you find something?"

Leon: "Blood."

Ernest: "Blood?" *He gasped and quickly focused, causing the purple rings to spiral around his iris.* "I sense-"

Celest: "No!-" *She quickly spun around, slapping Ernest across the face.*

Ernest: *He held his cheek in confusion.* "I don't understand?"

Kairi: "Yeah, you brought him so he could-"

*A screech-like roar echoed in the distance, catching the entire party's attention.*

Leon: "What the dirty lamp was that?!"

Ernest: "W-Watch your tongue-"

Celest: "Just as thy feared.. It's awake.."

Leon: "W-What was that?!"

Celest: "It has heightened senses.. It now knows we're here."

Kairi: "Who's here?"

Leon: "It?"

Ernest: "I apologise-"

Celest: "It is fine. Our priority is to slay the abomination and leave alive."

Kairi: (I'm actually a little scared-)

Leon: "Ernest, what kind of Scoldrant do you think we're up against?"

Ernest: *He shivered in fear, glancing at Leon.* "It sounded canine, but.."

Leon: "But?"

Celest: "Nonetheless, let us move forward." *She ignored the blood and continued to walk across the room, placing her hand on another square.*

Ernest: *The sounds of another elevator door opening caught his attention.* "Another level?"

Celest: "Our destination should be two more levels down."

Ernest: (That's around where that roar came from-)

Leon: "Let's go, aye." *He spoke to Kairi and started to walk towards Celest.*

--

Lance: "Man, this is startin' to look like a sci-fi thriller."

Luna: "It's like I'm inside someone's dream. It's actually a little scary."

Leon: *He nodded his head.* "I've seen some weird stuff during my years as an Elementalist, but, this thing.."

Lance: *He twitched with excitement and anticipation.* "Alright, flashback!"

Leon: "Yes." *He smiled, triggering another flashback.*

--

*The elevator door opened, cueing the party to walk into the next room.*

Ernest: *He watched the lights flicker, causing him to notice smears of blood all over the walls.* "What-?"

Celest: "Now that our presence is known. Ernest, check for any abnormalities."

Leon: *He squinted his eyes and shook his head in disorientation.* (When the lights flicker off, I can't see a thing.)

Ernest: *He scanned across the room, observing everything with heightened vision.* "I don't see anything standing out, but I can tell you there's definitely something in here."

Kairi: "Oh great."

Leon: "Let's go." *He grunted and walked into the room, keeping a brave face.*

Kairi: (He's pretty courageous-)

Celest: "Hmph." *She stepped out of the elevator and reached over her shoulder, unsheathing a pink javelin.*

Kairi: *She noticed the javelin and the sparks around it, causing her to move in a defensive manner.* (Looks like the enemy is close-)

Leon: "Just to the other side, Celestiana?"

Ernest: (This feeling of uncertainty.. It's like I'm in the cold parts of The Twilight Forest.)

Leon: "I know you already said so, Ernie. But there's somethin' in here." *He frowned in thought and stopped, observing the area around him.*

Kairi: *She followed Celest, cautiously glancing to each side.* "It doesn't help that this place looks so unfamiliar.. I feel out of place."

Leon: "Yea, I know what you m-"

*A red, shadow-like pulse slammed into Leon, pushing him across the floor.*

Celest: "Leon!-"

?????: "Gnoarth!" *A red, fleshy appearing, dog-like creature suddenly pounced from the ceiling, diving directly towards Leon.*

Leon: *He placed his hands on the ground, looking up in shock.* "Shit, wat is that?!"

Ernest: *He gasped, cupping his hands.* (He can't react in-)

Leon: "Lightning Chain Blast." *Seven fluoro green strings of lightning curved up in a cage-like manner around him, blasting up into the air.*

Kairi: *She gasped as flashes of green lightning lit up the room.* (Lightning!-)

?????: "Gnooowhl-" *It howled in shock as the lightning pierced into its body, causing it to explode into a cloud of blood.*

Kairi: *She watched parts of flesh roll across the floor in disgust.* "Eww-"

Celest: "It's a Mex spawn-" *She spoke in an urgent manner, facing the parts of flesh on the ground.*

Leon: "No offence, Celestiana." *He stood back up, forming a fist.* "But, I kinda killed it already."

Ernest: *He lowered his arms, nodding his head in agreement.* "No Scoldrant can survive an attack of that magnitude-"

Mex Spawn: *Its blood and flesh slowly drained into a ball, catching the party's attention.* "Gnoarth."

Kairi: *She stepped back, watching its body form back into the dog-like creature.* "W-What?"

Ernest: "No Scoldrant can!-"

Celest: "Cerenity Stroke." *She jumped towards the spawn and waved her javelin across, slashing a stroke of white light across the room.*

Leon: *He watched the light pierce into the Scoldrant.* "Got it!-"

Celest: "Thy will require help! The only way to defeat Mex spawns are-" *She spun around, slashing the spawn to each side in a combo-like manner.* "-Is to defeat it in a combo!"

Leon: "Got it! Lightning Blast." *He pushed forward, blasting a fluid stream of green lightning past Celest and into the spawn.*

Kairi: (His manipulation is.. The level of Neurons in his attacks is absolutely astronomical.)

Ernest: "Come to me!" *He shouted and threw a green orb into the air, causing a lime glyph to spiral in front of him.*

Celest: "Divinity strike, number eighty five, Star Burst." *She jabbed the javelin into the spawn's body, causing cuts of light to form a star sign.*

Mex Spawn: "Gnoowl-?!" *It howled in pain and focused on its body, causing its cut limbs to reconnect.*

Kairi: (How is that possible?! I see its limbs get cut off and string back before even touching the ground-)

Mex Spawn: "DARK STRI-"

Leon: "Crescent Volt Hook." *He waved to the side, causing an instantaneous violent crescent of purple lightning to pierce through the spawn's skull.*

Kairi: (Leon just disrupted that thing from using Remenistal! Maybe he isn't as useless as I thought?)

Ernest: "Aquarion." *He watched a green fish, reptilian-like Scoldrant splash onto the floor.*

Aquarion: "Wooosh?"

Ernest: "Bubble Blast!"

Aquarion: "BUBBLE BLAST" *It inhaled deeply through its gills, breathing out a rush of small blue bubbles.*

Celest: "HOLYSHADE" *She raised the javelin above her and suddenly pushed towards the spawn, blasting a stream of white lightning through its body.*

Mex Spawn: "Gno!-"

Kairi: "Ougi." *She spread her arms, causing a swirl of wind to expand around her.*

Leon: "Lightning Chain Volt Blast." *He clapped his hands, causing thick fluoro crescent streams of green lightning to instantaneously pierce the spawn's body.*

Celest: *She smirked, watching the lightning string in between the bursts of bubbles.* (A party full of offensive people. We've hit this abomination over thirty times while keeping it airborne!)

Kairi: *She waved her arms in a scissor-like manner, causing fluoro white wind to slice the air towards the spawn.* "Peel and halve my foes' body, Unacceptable Divider."

Celest: *She watched the white wind slice straight through the spawn, cutting it into four pieces.* (Its regeneration is slowing down!-)

Ernest: "Aquarion, clean this mess up! Hydro Cannon!"

Aquarion: "HYDRO CANNON" *It opened its mouth, blowing out a high pressured stream of water.*

Celest: *She swayed to the side, watching the stream of water violently slam the spawn into the wall.* "Now finish it off!"

Kairi: "Ougi! Unacceptable Divider." *She swayed her arms in a scissor-like manner, slicing waves of fluoro white wind towards the spawn.*

*The wind hit the ground, causing a pulse of water, blood and flesh to explode across the wall.*

Ernest: "Aquarion, Aqua Liquid!-"

Celest: *She watched the vibrant flesh and blood colour turn into a dead-like black shade, causing her to interrupt Ernest.* "It's done."

*Celest's words caused the entire party to stand out of their battle-ready poses.*

Leon: "What was that?!"

Kairi: *She ran up to the party, instantly holding her hands.* "Restoring winds, sway and swirl, calm my allies' will, RESTORING HALCYON"

*A wave of wind blew the party's hair and clothes to one side, restoring their stamina.*

Leon: "Huh?" *He looked at his hands in confusion.* "That didn't heal me, but I feel great."

Kairi: "That Remenistal rejuvenates one's stamina. It doesn't physically heal any wounds."

Leon: "Wow! That's truly awesome."

Kairi: "I learnt the Remenistal from studying flora-based wildlife."

*Leon and Kairi smiled at each other and suddenly gasped in realisation, causing them to look away with blushing cheeks.*

Ernest: "I know we've said this several times, but-" *He stepped forward, causing Aquarion to burst into a pulse of water.* "Explain yourself, immediately."

Leon: "..." *He silently faced Celest as if he was interested in what she had to say.*

Celest: "One zero nine six.."

Leon: "Who?"

Celest: "Mex.."

Ernest: "Who's that.."

Kairi: "A mex spawn?" *She whispered to herself in thought.* "So, that creature isn't our target?"

Leon: "It wasn't?"

Celest: "Very perceptive, Kairi."

Ernest: "Who is Mex?"

Celest: "Mex.. The only specimen that was able to survive the implantation process."

Leon: "Implantation process?" *He raised an eyebrow, scratching the back of his head in confusion.*

Celest: "Remember when thy spoke about the experiments?"

Ernest: "Trying to spread the power of light to others?"

Celest: "Yes.. What makes this foe so dangerous is its Radiatons."

Kairi: "I've only heard rumours about Radiatons.. Aren't they just an added power to Remenistal, allowing the user to heal wounds through emotion?"

Celest: "A unique way of looking at it, but thou could say so."

Ernest: "And how does this relate to Mex?"

Celest: "Its Radiatons are at the purest it can be. It doesn't require any emotions to tap into the Radiatons' full power."

Leon: "What does that mean for us?"

Celest: "Like this spawn. It is needed to be struck with a combo. It has instant self-healing regeneration abilities."

Ernest: "I didn't sign up for this-"

Celest: "To be quite realistic. The four of us were chosen for this possible outcome."

Kairi: "So you weren't sure it was this Mex?"

Celest: "No. Although we hoped it wasn't, we still prepared for the worst."

Leon: "Why us?"

Celest: "It's all of your abilities."

--

Luna: "Abilities?"

Lance: "Dude, I never knew you guys were so kool! Unacceptable Blast." *He zapped his fingers in a childish manner, ignoring Luna's question.*

Leon: *He looked at Luna, nodding his head.* "Ernest's ability lies in his Soul Link. I don't know much about Scoldrant Users, but a Soul Link averages fifty-fifty in power to each recipient."

Luna: "Yea?" *She nodded her head for confirmation.*

Leon: "He's able to control how much power he flows in between the user."

Luna: "So he can give over ninety percent of his power into his Scoldrant?"

Leon: "Yes."

Luna: "Wat about Celest?"

Leon: "She's crazy powerful, she doesn't need one haha."

Lance: "And.. You?"

Leon: "I have the ability to break past the standard evolutionary system of abilities."

Luna: "Wut?"

Leon: "Haha. To simply put it, without the nerdy mechanics behind it-"

Lance: "Aha, someone who talks my language." *He smirked in approval.*

Leon: "I can combine Remenistal-based attacks."

Luna: "Like when you used that Lightning Volt wateva Blast?"

Leon: "Yes."

Lance: "That was kool-"

Luna: "And mum's?"

Leon: "She's able to use her Ougi as freely as a simple low-levelled Remenistal or Azure Burst."

Luna: "Kool."

Lance: "I'm hell into this story. What happens next?"

Leon: "Celest takes us to the next floor below, and-"

--

*The elevator slid open in four different ways, allowing the party to cautiously step forward.*

Celest: "Be on guard. Mex is here." *She spoke in a serious manner, stepping forward with her javelin pointing outwards.*

Leon: (She said it will be far worse than the spawn-)

?????: (Life signs?) *A croaky, canine-like voice echoed in the party's minds, causing them to stop in mid-step.*

Leon: "How-?"

Celest: "Where are thou, Mex?!"

Mex: (I will leave this facility and spread my power across the lands.)

Ernest: (It's communicating in a similar fashion to a Soul Link-)

Leon: (This is creeping me out.) *He clicked his fingers, causing two pole-like swirls of green lightning to form in his hands.*

Celest: "How did thou awaken?"

Mex: (I finally recovered..)

*Red shadow-like tentacles oozed out from one side of the wall, catching the party's attention.*

Kairi: (There it is!-) *She watched blood drip off a human-shaped object, causing her to squirm in disgust.*

--

Lance: "Alright. Now you can say it looks like somethin' from one of my games."

Luna: "One of the shooter ones?"

Lance: "Yea."

Leon: "Despite its weak, disgusting appearance. It was strong.."

Lance: "I have a serious question though."

Leon: "Go for it." *He looked at Lance in a serious manner.*

Lance: "Wat kind of name is Mex?"

*Luna and Leon face palmed, triggering another flashback.*

--

Celest: "How have thou been affecting the environment around the other Unknown Territories?!"

Mex: "I am merely readying to use them for what they were designed to do."

Celest: "N-No." *She gasped, catching the party's attention.*

Kairi and Leon: "What is it?" *They glanced at each other before focusing back to Celest.*

Ernest: "The five Unknown Territories were designed to transport long distances."

Kairi and Leon: "So?" *They paused, glancing at each other again.*

Ernest: "Very far places.."

Celest: (Despite being sealed away, Mex was able to regenerate his power and somehow broke free?)

Mex: *It glanced along the walls, noticing a massive test tube-like container.* "I was relieved when I was free-"

Kairi: "Unacceptable Divider." *She swayed forward, slicing fluoro white wind towards Mex.*

Mex: "Remenistal-?" *It watched its abnormally long arm slice into three pieces, splashing into blood along the ground.*

Ernest: "Go, Aquarion!" *He shouted, watching a lime spiralling glyph materialise in front of him.*

Mex: *It looked down, watching the blood and flesh suddenly string off the ground, merging back into its body.* "Thou will not win-"

Celest: *She leant forward, causing radiant wings to burst out from her back.* "Remember! A combo!"

Leon: *He flashstepped in front of Mex, firmly holding onto the pole-like strings of lightning.* "Streaming Bolt Duo."

*Leon shouted, thrusting the lightning poles into Mex's body at incredible speeds.*

Mex: "Urgh!" *It shouted and frowned at Leon, causing seven tentacles to sprout from its body.* "Die!" *It watched the blood string with each jab of Leon's poles, causing the tentacles to pierce towards him.*

Leon: *He noticed the tentacles and flashstepped to the side, watching them sway past him.* "Yarh!" *He sliced one of the poles to his side, cutting the tentacles with ease.*

Mex: "Foolish mortal!-"

Celest: *She suddenly appeared in a swirl of white light, slashing the javelin across Mex's face.* "Repent!"

Mex: "Pests!" *It screeched, causing its wounds to instantly regenerate.*

Ernest: (I'm giving you sixty percent of my power, go!)

Aquarion: "AQUA TALONS" *It swayed its fin-like arms to each side, causing strings of water to violently spiral towards Mex.*

Mex: "Rot, lower being." *It looked up, glaring at Celest.* "Multi-Vein Snap."

Celest: *She gasped with widening eyes.* "Not possible!-"

Kairi: "Ougi, Cloud-nine." *She withdrew her arm, causing a wall of fog to swirl in front of Celest.*

Mex: *It rammed its tentacles through the fog, causing whooshes of wind to slice its tentacles to liquid.*

Leon: "Aha, nice!-" *He watched the chunks of tentacles rain on the ground, simultaneously avoiding waves of tentacles in a skilful manner.*

Kairi: *She lowered her arms, causing the fog to spiral away.* "Phew-"

Celest: "Much appreciated for the save, Kairi." *She flew across the air, slashing the javelin into Mex's back.*

Leon: "Lightning Blast." *He crossed his lightning poles and swayed forward, causing a car-sized stream of green lightning to burn into Mex's flesh.*

Mex: "Why thou!-" *Bursts of water scratched it across the face, causing one of its eyeballs to pop out.*

Ernest: "Direct hit!"

Aquarion: "Wooosh."

Celest: "Star Burst." *She hovered in the air and jabbed the javelin in a combo-like manner, causing cuts of light to form a star sign.*

Kairi: "Ougi, Unacceptable Divider." *She swayed her arms in a scissor-like manner, slashing fluoro white wind towards Mex's neck.*

Ernest: "Aquarion, use your expert levelled Remenistal!"

Aquarion: "Power of the deep depths, summon the soothing aqua and flow with the spirits that borrow your power-"

Mex: "Kah-" *It spoke under its breath as the fluoro white wind slice its head off.*

Ernest: (Aquarion!) *His voice echoed in Aquarion's mind.*

Aquarion: *It paused, causing a blue glyph to shine under its feet.* "Whoosh."

Leon: *He lowered the lightning poles, watching Mex's head hit the ground.*

Celest: *She continued to jab the javelin into Mex's body.* "What are thou doing?! It will only be defeated by combo-like attacks!"

Mex: "Time freeze, three inverted stars gather, AYON RAPTURE" *It shouted, causing the area around Leon to crack and shatter like glass, causing sparks to appear on the metallic floors around him.*

Leon: "Arh!-" *He suddenly blasted across the floor, causing his lightning poles to spark into nothing.*

Ernest: *He watched veins from Mex's neck connect back into his body.* "Aquarion!"

Aquarion: "AQUATIC RAPIDS" *It spoke with an echoing voice, causing a violent swirl of water to crash on top of Mex's body.*

Celest: *She spiralled up, avoiding the water.* (From what thy'm sensing.. We've all exhausted more Neurons individually and together than Mex has.)

Leon: "That's it-" *He stood back up, wiping blood from his lips.* "Ougi-"

--

Lance: "His Ougee! I bet it's a rocket launcher of lightning bolts!"

Luna: "Nah, it's probably a combination of all his attacks in one."

Leon: "To be honest.. It's a rabbit made of lightning.." *He spoke in a serious manner, catching Luna and Lance's attention.*

Lance: "A rabbit..? Kool.." *He spoke with no enthusiasm, causing Leon to laugh.*

Leon: "Haha, that gullible, oi?"

--

Leon: "Call forth the lightning's imperial judgement!" *He suddenly burst into thick streams of green lightning.*

Ernest: *He glanced to his side, staring at a human-shaped figure of lightning.* "Aquarion, get out of there!"

Aquarion: "Whoo-" *It faced Ernest and pushed forward, sliding towards him on slimy water.*

Celest: (Unlike Kairi and Ernest, thy'm safe in the air-) "PHOTON SHOT" *She pulled the javelin back and straightened her free hand, causing a ball of white light to materialise in front of her.*

Leon: "Rays shine down-" *The lightning suddenly flashed above Mex.* "Strike down-"

*Leon waved his hand, causing bolts of green lightning to flare into Mex's back.*

Kairi: *She covered her eyes, gasping in amazement.* (Wow-)

Leon: "Electricity, lightning, same thing, brand your power into my enemies' flesh!" *He suddenly flashed like lightning in front of Mex's head.* "Hah!"

*Leon pushed forward, causing a violent vortex of green lightning to scorch into Mex's face.*

Leon: "Flashstepping Strobe Light Storm." *He flashed in every direction around Mex, blasting barrages of thick lightning into his body.*

Celest: "Now that is a combo!"

Ernest: (My eyes!) *He observed the lightning, watching its stream flash in slow motion.* (Each lightning including the initial Ougi release, he has hit over ninety seven times!)

Celest: "Hermph." *She spun around, hitting the ball of light with her javelin.*

Mex: "Useless, pitiful creature-" *The ball of light hit the ground in front of Mex, suddenly expanding into razors of light around him.*

Ernest: (Another combo!)

Kairi: (My turn-) *She shook her head, jumping forward.* "Ougi, winds caress me!"

*Kairi swayed her arms, slicing chunks of Mex's body in the direction of her motion.*

Kairi: "Here-" *She spun around, causing a swirl of Mex's body to fling in the air.*

Ernest: (She controls the wind?)

Celest: *She watched Mex's body suddenly slice off in the line of Kairi's movement.* (It's as if she's using a full-scale Air Slash-)

Kairi: "HOWLING GALES"

*Visible waves of wind pushed all of Mex's body parts on the floor back.*

Celest: (Her Ougi grants access to the forbidden wind Remenistal!-)

Kairi: "Hiyarh!" *She waved her arms dropping to the floor, causing Mex's body to explode into small pieces.*

Ernest: "Clean it up, Aquarion!"

Aquarion: "AQUA LIQUID" *It swayed to the side, causing a wave of water to splash away the surrounding blood.*

Leon: *He landed on the ground, watching lightning string around his arms.* "Phew."

Celest: *She watched strings of vein-like blood slowly connect each part of Mex's body.* (Blast the Astragons!-) "We need to place it back in its seal!"

Leon: "What about slaying it?!"

Celest: "We can't!"

Kairi: *She took a deep breath, sitting on her legs.* (I should've used my strongest skill in the first place-)

Leon: "I don't get you. It is slain, right?"

Ernest: *He stared at the chunks of flesh, causing the purple rings to spiral around his iris.* "No! I still sense life in it!"

Leon: "Y-You do?"

Celest: *She faced the opened test tube and flew across the other side of the room, towards a large Rosterology console.* "Thy will need to bypass security functions!"

Ernest: "What do you want us-?!"

Celest: "Push Mex back into the container!"

Leon: (I'm not sure what's happening, but Celest knows what she's talking about-) "Alright!" *He shouted in a confident manner, hiding his growing exhaustion.*

Kairi: *She squeaked, slowly standing back up on her feet.* "Okay."

Ernest: *He looked at Celest, nodding his head in agreement.* "Of course."

Mex: *Its body slowly reformed into a humanoid figure, catching the party's attention.* "Thou dare defy your new Valkyrie? Nyahahaha."

Celest: *She landed on the ground and stepped forward, touching the console's keyboard in a professional manner.* "Thy see.." *She whispered to herself out loud.*

Mex: "Thou disgusting, pitiful creatures.."

Kairi: "We're disgusting?! Have you looked at yourself?!" *She screamed and pushed forward, blasting a howling wind towards Mex.* "CYCLONIC WINDS"

Leon: "Lightning Blast." *He leant back and blasted a thick stream of lightning towards Mex's growing body.*

Aquarion: "Taste the power of concentrated currents, consume the sacred waters-" *It stood in front of Ernest and took a deep breath, causing a frog-like sac to expand underneath its neck.*

Mex: *It slowly pushed back, causing its eyes to shine golden.* "I am Radiatons! Thou cannot beat me!"

Leon: *He watched his lightning hit Mex in the chest, causing him to frown in concentration.* (I'll just boost the Neurons and fire waves of Astragons, to push him back.)

Aquarion: "HYDRO CANNON" *It shouted with an echoing voice, blasting a car-sized gush of water towards Mex.*

Leon: (This Mex thing is strong!) *He noticed tentacles erupt out of Mex's back, causing him to gasp.*

Kairi: (We're not in position!-) *She shuffled to the side, causing the ongoing wind to blow at a different angle.*

Ernest: *He watched Mex slide back.* (This still isn't enough!) "Aquarion, here's ninety percent of my power!" *He shouted, causing the air around Aquarion to warp.*

Aquarion: "Whoosh." *Its stream of water suddenly and violently expanded.*

Leon: (We can't keep this up and it'll get us-) *He lowered his arm, causing the lightning to flash away.*

Kairi: *She groaned with a sudden struggle, causing her to grit her teeth at Leon.* "What are you doing?! We can't do this by ourselves!-"

Leon: *He touched his elbows, causing swirls of cloud to form above Mex's body.* "Tear asunder, Lightning Storm."

*Lightning sparked and flashed inside the cloud before violently falling like rain into Mex's body.*

Mex: "Peasants!" *It roared in pain as the tentacles above its back burnt into charcoal.*

Kairi: "Awesome!"

Mex: "What hope do thou expect to-" *It noticed the test tube behind it, causing it to suddenly scream in terror.* "You cannot!"

Aquarion: *Its gushing current of water suddenly burst, causing a wave of powerful rain-like wind to continue pushing Mex back.* "Whoosh."

Celest: *She continued to push buttons on the console and an enormous red circle highlighted on a trackpad, cueing her to hold it until it changed to green.* "It's ready!"

*Celest screamed and looked over her shoulder as if she couldn't move her hands off the console.*

Mex: *It sprouted more tentacles and violently dug them into the flooring, allowing it to endure the water, wind and lightning.* "This is not possible!-"

Leon: (Nearly there!) *He shouted in thought, ignoring his shaking arms.*

Ernest: "Aquarion, use all my strength!"

Mex: "Even if thou seal me! I will come back one day, just as I recently have-"

Kairi: "Shut your disgusting flaps!-" *She slightly curved her hand and a wave of wind sliced all of Mex's tentacles off.*

Mex: "No!" *It suddenly lifted off the ground, flying into and against the back of the test tube.*

Kairi: *She watched the blood and flesh from Mex smear all over the floor.* (Eww-)

Mex: "No, I won't allow this!" *Its shouts slightly bounced off the surrounding test tube glass.*

Ernest: "Celest!"

Leon: "Celestiana, now!"

Celest: *She enthusiastically pressed her hands into the green circle, causing the test tube to shut.* "Excellent-.."

Mex: "JSsb dksg egdh." *Its voice muffled through the glass before a rush of white steam suddenly put it to sleep.*

Ernest: *He dropped to one knee and held his throat, causing Aquarion to disintegrate into a burst of water.* (You did well..)

Leon: "Gah-.." *He awkwardly swayed to each side before collapsing on one leg.*

Kairi: *She took a deep breath and placed her hands on her knees, watching sweat drip off her face.* (Once again, eww.)

Celest: *She turned around, sighing in accomplishment.* "Mission completed."

Leon: *He looked over his shoulder, noticing Celest in an exhausted-like state.* "Why are you tired? You didn't fight it."

Celest: "Thy had to pour ongoing Radiatons into the console in order to activate the security protocols immediately."

Leon: "Ah."

Celest: "Nonetheless, excellent work, everyone."

Ernest: "I wasn't expecting to be completely worn out like this."

Leon: "You and me both."

Kairi: "If we're done here. Can we get out? This place gives me the creeps."

Celest: *She nodded her head and took a deep breath, readying herself.* "Thy will take a few minutes and activate a teleportation glyph."

Leon: "Phew, sweet."

--

Luna: "That was awesome!"

Lance: "I actually never even thought to ask how you guys met."

Luna: "Much better than meeting at the bar, aye."

Lance: "Aha, I reckon."

Leon: "I'm good at expressing a lot of things dear to me, except for emotions."

Luna: "So what happened after that?"

Leon: "Well, after telling us to keep the mission confidential, Celest teleported us back individually.."

Lance: "Wat? So no reward or anythin'?"

Luna: "Didn't you 'n' mum get to know each other a little better after?"

Leon: "Nope."

Luna: "Oh, wat?" *She spoke in disappointment.*

Leon: "Haha." *He chuckled and stared at the green crystal, triggering another flashback.*

--

*Leon walked past several tall trees, high up on a rugged mountain.*

Leon: (It's cold out here.) *He shivered and looked down, breathing out mist.*

--

Lance: "Wait, so what's happenin' now?"

Leon: "I went back to The Ruins of Estel."

Lance: "Ruins of wat?"

Luna: "I know I got transported here before you, but were you under a rock all this time? It's the city of Elementalists."

Lance: "Then, why, don't, you, just, say that?" *He grunted in a frustrated manner.*

Luna: *She rolled her eyes, focusing her attention back to Leon.* "So you went back?"

Leon: *He nodded his head, looking up in recollection.* "I never saw Ernest or Kairi after that. I recovered from my battle and was sent out on another mission."

Lance: "Why so fast?"

Leon: "You mean, another mission?"

Lance: "Yea."

Leon: "Like I said before, it was because I was recognised for my abilities."

Lance: "Makes sense."

Luna: "Whereabouts were you? It looked really cold."

Leon: "It was winter and up very high."

Lance: "Wat was this mission about?"

Leon: "There was an Astragon absorbing Scoldrant."

Luna and Lance: "Ooo."

--

Leon: (I can sense something up ahead-)

*Two waves of fluoro white wind cut through tree branches, slicing towards Leon.*

Leon: "Hmm?" *He glanced to the side and suddenly flashstepped, causing the fluoro wind to cut the tree branches behind him.*

*The sounds of falling branches could be heard as the wind whooshed into the distance.*

Leon: *He reappeared where he stood, facing the direction where the wind came from.* "Show yourself?"

?????: *She suddenly dived out from a nearby tree, straightening her fingers.* "Hiyah." *She jabbed towards Leon's chest with a powerful force of wind behind her.*

Leon: *Objects momentarily moved in slow motion around him and he looked at the woman with widening eyes.* (Hey, it's-)

*Leon quickly grabbed the woman's wrist and swayed to the side, knocking her ankles with his foot.*

Woman: "Huh-?" *She watched Leon's blurred image let go of her wrist, causing the wind from behind to push her face-first into the ground.*

Leon: "Ouch, that woulda hurt." *He smirked and scratched behind his head as if he was nervous in her presence.*

Woman: "You stupid, numpty."

Leon: "Aha, you attacked me." *He walked up to the woman with a widening smile, offering to help her up.*

Woman: "I didn't imagine I'd see you again." *She looked up and hesitantly raised her hand, allowing Leon to help her up.*

Leon: "Kairi." *He stepped back and noticed she observed his facial expressions, causing him to hide his smile.* "So.."

Kairi: "So what? We're like buddies now?" *She spoke in a condescending manner as if she was annoyed that he was there.*

Leon: "Well.. Yeah? Ain't we?"

Kairi: "I.. I don't know."

Leon: "Huh?" *He looked hurt, staring at Kairi in shock.*

Kairi: "Well.. You're like an Elementalist."

Leon: "Oh, really?" *He sounded disappointed.* "You still on about that?"

Kairi: "What do you mean? You didn't like my Remenistal status."

Leon: "But that Remenistal helped us out."

Kairi: "...-"

Leon: "Besides, I'm not allowed to like your weapon, they never said anythin' about the user." *He smirked with blushing cheeks, continuing to scratch the back of his head in a nervous manner.*

Kairi: "Umm, I guess." *She looked down, cupping her hands in a shy-like manner.*

Leon: "Wat are you doin' up here?"

Kairi: "Well, not that it's any of your business, but I'm actually seeking a Scoldrant that is said to manipulate the Astragons around here."

Leon: "Manipulate?"

Kairi: "Yeah."

Leon: "I thought it could absorb the Astragons?"

Kairi: *She looked surprised.* "You're searching for it too?"

Leon: *He nodded his head.* "We're close."

Kairi: "We are?" *She spoke as if she was having trouble finding it.*

Leon: "Problems?"

Kairi: "N-No." *She spoke under her breath, looking away.*

Leon: "Lead the way?" *He smirked and waved his hand, implying for her to move on.*

Kairi: "Hmff." *She turned around in a feminine manner and started to walk through the bush.*

Leon: "Umm...?"

Kairi: "I'm going the wrong way, aren't I?"

Leon: "Aha, yeah." *He smirked and took several steps to the side, motioning his head for her to follow.*

Kairi: *She sighed in defeat and smiled, nodding her head.* "If we're going to work together, I might as well get to know you a little better."

Leon: "Better? I thought we were buddies already? Aha."

Kairi: "Hehe-" *She quickly covered her mouth as if she didn't want to show signs of happiness.*

--

Luna: "You two are so kewt. It doesn't feel like it's my parents. It's so weird."

Lance: "I feel a bit weird too. I usually despise these types of stories. But I'm fully into it, aye."

Leon: *He smiled, leaning to the side in a modest manner.* "I'm cute and the best storyteller ever? Pretty good I say."

Luna and Lance: "Ahaha!"

Lance: "When does birth-giver stop bein' such a tsundere?"

Leon: "A what?"
Luna: "Ahaha."

Leon: *He shook his head with a smile.* "Alright, moving along."

--

Kairi: "Hehehe."

Leon: "Ahahaha."

Kairi: "An Elementalist with humour, I'm quite shocked."

Leon: "A Remenistal User who doesn't seem to destroy the things around her. I'm the one that's shocked."

Kairi: "Well-"

*A footstep rumbled the ground, followed by a deep roar-like groan, catching Kairi and Leon's attention.*

Leon: "Who-?"

Kairi: "Who? It's Margaret?"

Leon: "Huh-?"

Kairi: "It's the Scoldrant, numpty."

Leon: "Aha-"

Kairi: "It's this way-"

Leon: *He sprinted past Kairi, running towards the groan.* "Let's go!"

Kairi: *She smiled, staring at Leon's back.* "Sure!"

Leon: *He ran past several trees and instantly noticed a large white bear-like Scoldrant, causing him to raise his arms.* "It's here, Kairi!"

Kairi: *She ran past the trees and stopped next to Leon, noticing the bear.* "Whoa-"

Leon: *He clicked his fingers, causing streams of lightning to form themselves into pole-like weapons.* "Be careful, aye."

Kairi: *She frowned with concentration, causing a swirl of wind to blow snow around her.* "I wonder how its ability affects the way it fights?"

Leon: "I'll check-"

Polar Bear: "Heereh!" *It noticed Leon and Kairi, facing them with instinctive killing intent.*

Leon: "Settle down, Margaret!" *He flashstepped in front of the Scoldrant, jabbing one of the lightning poles into its side.*

Margaret: "Heeeerrrh-" *She watched lightning string up her white fur, burning the hairs along the way.*

Kairi: "Hmm?" (It doesn't seem that tough? But this was a very important task given to me-)

Margaret: "Heroarh." *She intensely opened her eyes, causing the lightning to swirl around her face and into her eyes.*

Leon: "H-Huh-?" *He watched the last string of lightning swirl into Margaret's eyes, leaving behind orbs of white light.*

Kairi: (It absorbed the lightning, but left the Neurons?)

Leon: "How-?"

Margaret: "Haor!" *She opened her jaw, blasting a stream of green lightning into Leon's chest.*

Leon: "Gerh!-"

Kairi: "Ougi! Unacceptable Divider." *She leant to the side and waved one arm, slicing a fluoro white wave of wind towards Margaret.*

Leon: *He violently twitched on the spot, unable to move.* (This is my attack! It's definitely weaker without the Neurons, but my lightning is powerful-)

Margaret: *She noticed the white wind and closed her jaw, jumping out of the way.* "Heereh."

Kairi: "Are you okay?"

Leon: *He held his chest, nodding his head.* "Yea, I'm good.."

Kairi: "Are you sure? It was a strike of lightning on your chest!"

Leon: "I've got good resistance to lightning and fire, thanks to my elemental affinity."

Kairi: "RESTORING HALCYON"

Leon: *A swirl of wind caused him to stand up straight.* "Thanks."

Kairi: "AIR SWIRL" *She swayed her hand, causing a wave of wind to hit Margaret on the side of her head.*

Margaret: "Heereh!" *She roared in anger, suddenly widening her eyes.*

Leon: "Don't think Margie appreciated that-"

Kairi: *She listened to the wind unnatural swirl around Margaret's head.* "She's absorbing my wind!"

Leon: "Where's the Neurons?"

Kairi: "Wind is the only element that incorporates more Astragons than any other element."

Leon: "More Astragon usage against an Astragon thieving Scoldrant? So, you would've been at a big disadvantage."

Kairi: "Looks like it." *She spoke in an annoyed manner.* (I'm more frustrated at myself for not being much help.)

Margaret: *She opened her jaw and roared out a pulse of wind, violently pushing Leon back.* "Haor!"

Leon: *He looked to the side, glancing at Kairi.* "If it absorbs all our stuff, what are we gonna do?"

Kairi: "Umm, maybe we could combine our powers?"

Leon: "Like a Hi-Ougi?"

Kairi: "Th-That's not what I meant?" *She spoke with blushing cheeks.*

Leon: "Alright, let's try a Hi-Ougi." *He smirked, grabbing Kairi's hand.*

Kairi: "But, you have to-"

Leon: "Now!"

Kairi and Leon: "Hi-Ougi."

Leon: *He glanced to each side, shaking his head.* "Nothin'-"

Kairi: "You really are a numpty." *She hissed, pulling her hand out of her Leon's grip.* "You need to be family or have a deep connection with the other user."

Leon: "Oh? Is that how it works-"

Margaret: "Hoar!"

Leon: *He stared back at Margaret, gritting his teeth.* "What to do then?"

Kairi: "I got an idea."

Leon: "Awesome! Let's hear it-" *He pushed Kairi to the side and flashstepped several feet back, watching a wave of wind explode the tree behind where they stood.*

Kairi: *She looked surprised, watching flakes of snow fall from the tree's branches.* "Thank you-"

Leon: "Wat's your plan-?"

Kairi: "Just keep attacking it."

Leon: "Attacking it? It'll keep absorbing the Astragons in my-"

Kairi: "We hardly know each other, but trust me!"

Leon: *He paused and hesitantly nodded his head, straightening his arms.* "Alright." *He grunted and ran towards Margaret, watching strings of lightning form themselves into pole-like weapons.*

Kairi: (One of the reasons I accepted doing this task was because I'm knowledgeable with Neurons and wanted to witness how Astragons work-)

Leon: *He hit Margaret across the face, watching the lightning swirl into her eyes.* (Damn-) *He ignored the growing white orbs around her, creating more poles of lightning.*

Kairi: *She watched Leon continuously create poles of lightning, listening to their static-like whoosh sounds as he waved them.* (The basics of Neurons and Astragons is quite easy to remember-)

Leon: *He flashstepped to each side, closely avoiding Margaret's streams of green lightning.* (C'mon, Kairi!!)

Kairi: (But, when you learn more about Roharnia and Spacial Funnels, that's when things can get tricky..)

Leon: *He panted with one eye closed, watching his lightning swirl into Margaret's eyes.* "How much longer?"

Kairi: *She smirked, nodding her head.* "Get behind me!" *She screamed in an urgent manner, catching Leon's attention.*

Leon: "Why? I don't get it-" *He spoke in exhaustion and turned around, running away from Margaret.* (I'm too tired to even flashstep?)

Kairi: "Ougi." *She faced Margaret and concentrated, crossing her arms.*

Leon: "Despite the attack, Margie will just absorb-"

Kairi: "Unacceptable Divider." *She waved her arms in a scissor-like manner, slicing two waves of fluoro white wind at Margaret.*

Margaret: *She looked past the bundles of white orbs and intensely opened her eyes, readying to absorb Kairi's attack.* "Haor!"

Kairi: "Move out of the way!" *She screamed and quickly ran behind a nearby tree, causing Leon to closely follow.*

Leon: *He leant over Kairi and peaked around the tree, watching the wind hit the air in front of Margaret.* "See? Nothin'-"

*A sudden and violent pulse of wind, exploded the ground around Margaret, causing a distant flock of Scoldrants to swarm away.*

Leon: *He intensely stared at the falling snow-filled dirt cloud with a dropping jaw, noticing Margaret's arm roll out of his sight.* "Sh-She exploded?"

Kairi: "It worked." *She smiled to herself, catching Leon's attention.*

Leon: *He looked down, ignoring the fact he had her pressed against the tree.* "W-Wat happened?!"

Kairi: "When she absorbed your lightning for the first time, I instantly noticed the Roharnia."

Leon: "Roharnia? Isn't that physical Neurons?"

Kairi: "Yes. What Roharnia is, is condensed physical form of Neurons."

Leon: "And Neurons are power."

Kairi: *She nodded her head in agreement.* "While she was absorbing your Astragons, she was leaving raw power around her.*

Leon: "That's why you had me-." *He spoke to himself in realisation.*

Kairi: "So, instead of targeting Margaret, I aimed directly for the Roharnia, resulting in such." *She giggled and shrugged her shoulders as if she had nothing else to explain.*

Leon: "Wow."

Kairi: "Wait a minute? How do we know the Scoldrant was a girl?" *She turned around to face Leon, only to watch him kiss her.* "What are you-?"

*Leon and Kairi kissed with their eyes closed, breathing heavily through their nose.*

Leon: *He leant back with puckered lips and smiled, opening his eyes.* "You're amazing. I like you."

Kairi: "Oh?" *She spoke in a playful manner and smiled, as if she returned the feelings.*

Leon: "Yea." *He leant forward and passionately kissed her, unintentionally grinding her against the tree.*

--

Leon: "And, I don't want you seeing what happens next-"

Lance and Luna: "Eww."

Leon: "Haha, I don't need to give you the talk?"

Lance and Luna: "Eww."

Leon: "Haha."

Lance: (I'm not goin' to lie, what he did was pretty smooth.)

Luna: "So after being all gross, Leon, what happens next?"

Leon: "Well, we started to do what you see in those romantic movies."

Lance: "Like?" *He raised an eyebrow, staring at Leon in confusion.*

Leon: "We found ways to see each other before and after missions."

Luna: "Oh, that's right, you guys ain't allowed to see each other, aye."

Leon: *He looked down, hesitantly nodding his head.* "Yeah. Sometimes we even helped each other do missions."

Luna: "So, we're safe to say, you got to know each other really well?"

Leon: "Yeah. It was an amazing seven months-"

Lance: "Whoa, big time skip there."

Leon: "You want me to show you every single mission for the next seven months?!"

Lance and Luna: "Yes!-"

Leon: "Yeah, no."

Luna: (Aha.. I feel so comfortable with him. It's like, we don't know each other that well, but it feels like I can tell him anythin'-)

Leon: "So, we're doing some romantic stuff and we decide it's finally time we told our peers."

Lance: "Ooo, this will be excitin'-" *He unintentionally tightened his grip on the crystal, leaning forward with anticipation.*

--

*Leon and Kairi lay along a bed of differently coloured flowers, looking up to the beautiful clear sky.*

Kairi: *She pointed straight up, drawing Leon's attention to faint flickers in the sky.* "And that's the lunar signs."

Leon: "Fascinating. I didn't know you could see some stars while it was still daylight."

Kairi: "Hehe." *She took a deep breath, mentally preparing herself.* "Today is the day."

Leon: "How do you think they'll take it?"

Kairi: "Well, if it was anything like us, they'll probably neglect it at first, then realise how foolish they are."

Leon: "Yea, the Elementalists and Remenistal Users combining forces. It could really serve our people well by sharing each other's resources."

Kairi: "Wow, that's big talk from a numpty."

Leon: "Oi, I told you to stop callin' me that."

Kairi: "Told you to stop calling me that." *She groaned in an idiot-like manner, causing Leon to roll on top of her.* "Hehe, what are you doing, Leon?"

Leon: "Leon?" *He leant back, raising an eyebrow in a curious manner.* "This is Margaret, lemme absorb your Astragons!-"

*Leon growled like a bear and bit Kairi's neck, causing her to screech with a giggle.*

--

Luna: "Is it weird I actually like watching the younger version of you two?"

Leon: "Ah?" *He looked confused as if he was unsure how to respond.*

Lance: "In our defence, it's not somethin' many people will get to see."

Luna: "Yea." *She nodded her head, smiling at Leon as if she was happy to be with him.*

Leon: *He tilted his head and sighed, looking at the floor in a serious manner.* "Turns out they didn't like the idea as much as we had hoped.."

--

Kairi: *She stood in a secluded forest, crying in Leon's arms.* "What is so bad about us?"

Leon: "Nothin'. It'll just take time-"

Kairi: "We don't have time! We need their support."

Leon: "We don't have time?"

Kairi: *She leant back and sniffed, wiping away her tears with an awkward smile.* "We don't."

Leon: "I'm not followin' you?"

Kairi: "Feel my Neurons-" *She sniffed again and grabbed Leon's hand, placing it against her stomach.*

Leon: *He moved his fingers and concentrated as if he was trying to find something.* "I don't-" *He gasped with widening eyes, causing him to smile.*

Kairi: *She nodded her head in a proud manner.* "..."

Leon: "How did you know?"

Kairi: "Well-" *She stepped back and straightened her arm, causing Leon to look even more confused.*

Leon: "Is this some Remenistal User thing-?"

Kairi: "LIGHTNING BLAST" *She pushed her arm, blasting a faint string of lightning into the air.*

Leon: "Wow! You know lightning too?!"

Kairi: *She sighed and rolled her eyes.* "No.. My elemental affinity is wind."

Leon: "But how can you-?" *He paused in mid-sentence, suddenly grunting in realisation.* "OK, gotcha."

Kairi: "So, that's why we need help."

Leon: "I can raise our little one-" *He eagerly and arrogantly shook his head.* "We don't need their help."

Kairi: "I've heard of an offspring being able to use either of their parents' affinity. But, I've never heard of the parent being able to use their offspring's affinity before."

Leon: "I see what you mean now."

Kairi: "We have no idea what the mixture of our abilities will do."

Leon: "OK. I'm takin' you to Celestiana."

Kairi: "Celest?"

Leon: "She'll know what to do!" *He grabbed Kairi's hand and frowned in determination, power walking through the forest.*

--

Lance: "That sucks they couldn't help you out."

Luna: "Well, this totally explains our abilities."

Lance: "So, who's the baby?"

Leon and Luna: "..."

Lance: "Wat?"

Luna: "After viewin' some of your memories, I see where Lance gets his intelligence from."

--

Celest: *She stood on The Divine Path, staring at Leon and Kairi with a dropping jaw.* "Elementalist and Remenistal User?"

Kairi: "What do we do?"

Leon: "Just name it, anything, and I'll do it to the best of my abilities-" *He frowned with determination, glancing at Kairi.* "For my family."

Kairi: *She discreetly smiled at Leon.* "Celest?"

Celest: "There are two things that worry me."

Leon: "W-Wat is it?!"

Celest: "One, is the well-being of your child. And two, the mixture of blood."

Kairi: "Well-being?"

Leon: "What about our blood?"

Celest: "Thy'm not sure how, but news of your child will be inevitably spread across the lands."

Leon: (If they responded so negatively for us just being together, I'd hate to think what they would do if they heard about-) *He gritted his teeth in thought, forming a fist.*

Celest: "The reason thou two were chosen for our previous mission nearly a year ago, was because of your powerful bloodlines and affinity abilities."

Kairi: "My affinity allows me to recharge Neurons just by using the wind's current."

Leon: "Wow, really?!"

Kairi: "Hehe, yeah? Didn't I tell you that before?"

Leon: "No!-"

Celest: "Point being, thy'm not sure how this will affect your child."

Kairi: "It could make him very powerful."

Leon: "H-Him?"

Celest: "Or, it could cause immense stress on the child, which possibly and could lead up to death."

Kairi: *She silently gasped, staring at Celest with a dropping jaw.* (Death?)

Leon: "No.. What can we do, Celestiana?"

Celest: "It would be wise to take precautions seriously."

Kairi: "Anything for our baby?"

Celest: "Thy recommend a seal."

Leon: "A, seal?"

Celest: "Indeed. It's plausible to avoid the possibility of damage, by merely sealing one of your powers away."

Kairi: "That sounds fair." *She looked at Leon as if his opinion mattered.* "Leon?"

Leon: *He nodded his head.* "Yes. I agree with this."

Celest: "Then, whose powers shall be sealed?"

Leon: "I think mine."

Kairi: "Why?"

Leon: "Lightning is a dangerous affinity to have."

Kairi: "But you'll be there to raise him."

Leon: "True. But at the same time, you could also be at risk since your affinity isn't lightning."

Celest: "Thy see a valid point. Thy'm shocked it wasn't obvious sooner."

Kairi: "Okay. What do we do?"

Celest: "Leon, thy will show thou how to communicate with The Voice of On."

Kairi: "The Voice of On?"

Leon: *He glanced at Kairi, shaking his head.* "I'll explain it to you later."

Kairi: "Okay."

Celest: "Are thou ready?" *She glanced at Kairi and Leon, waiting for their responses.*

Leon and Kairi: "Yes!"

Lance: "Wow." *He smiled, placing a hand on his chest.* (I never knew they cared so much about me before I was even born.)

Luna: "I guess I didn't need a seal without Newgongs 'n' Astragongs, aye?"

Leon: "Yeah, we couldn't place a seal on your powers even if we wanted to."

Lance: "Man, I wonder wat Earth would be like if it had Rostickal?"

Luna: "I dunno, could be for the better or worse, I can see it goin' either way-"

Leon: "So, should I stop?"

Luna: "Aha, sorry!"
Lance: "My bad."

Leon: "Well thanks to The Voice of On, I was able to seal the Elementalist abilities in Lance's inner-self."

Lance: *He glanced at his hand.* (Who knows what could've happened if I woke up in this world with such power..)

Luna: "How or when did you get to Earth?"

Leon: "That's coming up now." *He smiled, triggering another flashback.*

--

Leon: *He opened his eyes, noticing Celest and Kairi standing around him.* "It's done-"

Kairi: "Like that?" *She sounded shocked as if she was expecting something else.*

Leon: *He nodded his head and stood up, standing in the middle of a floating flowery island.* "Alright, that's one problem down."

Celest: "Thy have also come up with a solution to the well-being of your child."

Kairi: "Yes?"

Celest: "It would be best to live a secluded life-"

Leon: "No! That's not OK."

Celest: "..."

Kairi: "L-Leon?"

Leon: "I had a sheltered life.. Instead of playing with the other kids, I was inside, training and adapting my manipulation abilities."

Kairi: "I-I didn't know-"

Leon: *He held Kairi's hand and looked at Celest.* "I don't want my son livin' a secluded life either."

Kairi: "Well, is there anything else?"

Celest: "Yes." *She sounded hesitant, catching Leon's attention.*

Leon: "Celestiana?"

Celest: "My close companion. She may be able to help thou."

Kairi: "P-Please?"

Celest: "It's the least thy can do, after your help with Mex and keeping it confidential." *She smiled, nodding her head in agreement.*

--

Lance: "Man, if our story ever became a book, this would be the best prologue ever."

Luna: "Aha."

Leon: "This ordeal took another two months."

Lance: "Wait, shouldn't I, be like, nearly born already?"

Leon: "You were close." *He smiled and looked up, causing the green crystal to flash.*

--

*Celest, Kairi and Leon stood in a line on a cold shore, staring at a woman's back.*

Celest: "Madora, thy have a request to ask of thou."

Madora: "Oh?" *She turned around and faced the party.* "Oh, deary me. It's been a long time, Celestiana."

Celest: *She slightly bent her knees in respect and stood up straight, glancing at Kairi's baby bump.* "We have lots to discuss."

Madora: "Oh?"

Leon: *He stepped forward, catching Madora's attention.* "This is our situation."

--

Lance: "Oi, it's the old fart!" *He gasped in shock as if he didn't expect it coming.*

Leon: (I would've been shocked that he knew her.. But she probably had something to do with transferring them back.)

Luna: "C'mon, what happens next?"

--

Madora: "I have heard your ordeal, and-" *She turned back around with her back facing the party.*

Kairi: "Madora?"

Madora: "I have no intentions of helping you."

Leon: "W-What?"

Celest: "..." *She silently stood on the spot as if Madora's decision didn't make a difference on her.*

Kairi: "We were finally able to seal our child's power."

Madora: "Seal?" *Her hair swayed around her shoulder by an unknown force.* "I sense power from within him."

Leon: "That because he has both Elementalist and Remenistal User blood."

Madora: *She silently gasped and intensely stared across the ocean, listening to the waves faintly crash in the distance.* (That can't be? One of the major prophecies.. A distant memory of the future..)

Leon: "Please?"

Celest: *She watched a white dove fly over her, catching her attention.* "Thy see."

Kairi: "Celest?"

Celest: "Thy must take my leave. Whatever happens, thy will be thinking of thou." *She smiled at Kairi and Leon before disappearing in a swirl of white light.*

Leon: "Thanks, my good friend."

Kairi: (Thank you, for all you've done, Celest.)

Madora: "I've changed my mind."

Kairi: "Y-You have?" *She spoke under her breath, filled with sudden hope.*

Madora: *She turned back around, facing Leon and Celest.* "I've been looking far beyond, seeing how far the Astragons can travel."

Leon: "What are you talkin' about?"

Madora: "I can give you a place to live, but at a major cost."

Kairi: "A cost?"

Madora: "You give up all ties here, including Neurons and Astragons themselves."

Leon: "Give up Neurons and Astragons?! Are you crazy?! How would we survive?!"

Madora: "Don't you care about your child?"

Kairi and Leon: "Of course!"

--

Lance: "This is all slowly makin' sense to me."

Leon: "Madora was able to show us what Earth looked like."

Lance: "Why did you go? I reckon, this world is..-"

Leon: "Don't say it, Lance."

Luna: "He's kinda right-"

Leon: *He shook his head as if they were wrong.* "You haven't experienced the beauty of Earth."

Lance: "The beauty? Really?"

Leon: "We wouldn't have agreed if we didn't see it ourselves."

Lance and Luna: "..."

Leon: "Trust me. You haven't seen all that there is to offer yet."

Lance: "..."

Leon: *He sighed, looking at Lance.* "Right then and there, if we chose to stay, you would've been held back."

Lance: "Held back?! If we didn't go to Earth, you wouldn't have fuckin' died!-"

Leon: "Lance Lighten! Watch your language!" *He shouted with an echoing voice, causing the entire room to shake.*

Luna: *She punched Lance on the shoulder.* "Seriously?!"

Lance: *He pouted and looked down, holding his anger back.* "I-I'm sorry."

Leon: *He sighed, hiding his emotional pain.* "Everyone has emotional chains, sometimes we wrap them around our own necks, sometimes it's the people close to us holding them down. You need to surround yourself with the people that will pull you up by those chains, instead of the ones that add more weight to them. It doesn't matter how individually gifted one can be, it's the people that touch those chains which determine how high or low you can go."

Lance: "Wat does that mean?"

Luna: "Similar to what he said about Earth's beauty, you're kinda only seein' the negatives."

Leon: "Exactly right, my darling."

Lance: "Since when did you get so emotionally mature? Like, you were emo, aye, and-" *He frowned at Leon.* "Wat has chains got to do with how I'm feelin'? I don't like analogies when it comes to my feelings."

Luna: "I've gone through a fair bit of emotional shit myself, I had to deal with the creator's disease, done some stupid stuff and now I've bounced back, stronger than ever."

Leon: *He looked sad.* "Have you seen a Radiaton User to heal the-?"

Luna: "Nah-" *She shook her head with a mature smile on her face.* "My guild keeps me pulled up pretty high."

Lance: "Only the negatives..? Determines how high or low I can go?" *He mumbled to himself, triggering an image of Ashton's smile.* (Ash..)

Leon: "Lance?"

Lance: "I don't want to spoil a great moment between the three of us, but-"

Luna: *She placed her free hand on Lance's shoulder.* "Then don't."

Lance: "Aye?" *He spoke under his breath as if he started to reflect on his attitude.*

Luna: "Lance?" *She sounded caring while slightly leaning forward to look at his face.*

Lance: "I'm kool.. You have to understand, dad.. My life would have been so much better if you were in it." *He looked up, revealing his watering eyes.*

Luna: "Lance.." *She smiled with watering eyes, rubbing his arm where she punched him.*

Leon: "..."

Lance: "You were so strong-" *He sniffed and looked down, triggering a flashback.*

--

Kairi: "W-Worse?" *She gasped under her breath, touching her chest in a hurt-like manner.*

Lance: "I could've lost you too." *He looked up, staring at Kairi with emotional eyes.*

Kairi: "Leon?" *She whispered under her breath, hiding her twitching fingers.*

Lance: "People who don't respect their parents are just-" *He looked around the room with his mouth open, unsure what to say.*

Alicia: "Unacceptable."

Lance: *He smiled in amazement, nodding his head.* "I look back at the way I treated you, and I feel so ashamed."

Kairi: "Leon was a powerful man, I was also hurt..."

Lance: "..."

Kairi: "Out of all-" *She paused, resting her cup on the table due to her shaking fingers.* "Out of all the ways to leave us, he went like that." *Her carefree, happy-like attitude disappeared, as she looked at Lance, speaking in a different tone.*

Lance: (I haven't heard her talk like that before.)

Kairi: "You weren't the only one who was grieving, Lance. I needed to put on a happy attitude to try and make things better."

Alicia: "S-Sometimes it's better to grieve together, support each other. You two could obviously understand the pain you were experiencing, so there was no reason to hide it."

Kairi: "..."

Alicia: "Family should be important-" *She paused and frowned, shaking her head in a correcting manner.* "Family is important!"

*Alicia spoke in recollection, glancing at both Lance and Kairi.*

Alicia: "They're there to compensate for your weaknesses and to compliment your strengths, together, that's what it means to be family."

Kairi: *She wiped a tear from under her eye, smiling at Alicia.* "How did you find this one, Lance? I think she's out of your league."

--

Lance: (Mum said he was powerful.. Outta all the ways to go.) *He looked up, staring at Leon.* (It kinda makes sense what she was talkin' about now.)

Leon: "We've just about reached the finale." *He awkwardly smiled, trying to boost Lance and Luna's morale.*

Lance: "Aha, yea?" *He sniffed, putting on a fake smile.*

Luna: "Any time skips?"

Leon: "Only a few hours. Turns out Madora is really powerful, she kept teleporting us from here to there, right to centre."

Lance: "Aha, I know what you mean! Did she have the hots for you too?"

Leon: "Haha."

Luna: "I don't get it?"

Lance: "And you never will."

Luna: "Wateva-" *She noticed Lance's innocent-like happiness, causing her to smile with him.*

Leon: "She started to do a Remenistic-like ritual in order to teleport us to Earth."

Luna: "Yea?"

Leon: "But her abnormally high power attracted some unwanted attention."

--

*Kairi and Leon stood in a grassy field, watching winds swirl around Madora.*

Madora: *She spread her arms, causing a glyph to shine rainbow colours underneath her feet.* "Open the forbidden gates-" *She continued to chant under her breath.*

?????: "What is happening here?!"

Leon: *He turned around in shock, staring at a man in warrior's armour.* "Who-?"

Warrior: "Who? That's my question!"

Kairi: "We don't have time for this!"

Leon: "Oh?"

Kairi: "Madora said, if she gets interrupted during this process, it may take a long time for us to have another opportunity to get transported!" *She hissed under her breath in an urgent manner and stared at the warrior, hiding her vulnerability.*

Leon: "My little boy will be seeing us soon without anyone chasing after him." *He spoke as if missing the opportunity couldn't be an option.*

Kairi: "Exactly."

Leon: "Gotcha." *He gritted his teeth and held Kairi's hand, frowning in determination.* "We're on the same page."

Kairi: "What are you doing? Fight him-"

Warrior: "Speak when I ask you a question!" *He shouted, reaching over his shoulder.*

Leon: "Do you feel it?!"

Kairi: *She gasped, slowly nodding her head in disbelief.* "Y-Yes?"

Warrior: "I am a captain!" *He shouted at the top of his lungs, causing his face to turn red.*

Leon and Kairi: "Hi-Ougi."

Warrior: "Don't ignore me! My strength is equal to the number three!" *He screamed and pulled his arm forward, watching sparks swirl around his lance.* "I'm the ranking of-"

Leon and Kairi: "Amperes Lightning Flare-"*Two waves of silver wind crossed the warrior before a sudden blast of green vein-like lightning to erupted into the air.*

Warrior: "Five-" *He spoke under his breath and collapsed face-first into the grass, suddenly bursting into tiny white orbs.*

--

Lance: "A one hit knock out! Nice!"

Luna: *She covered her mouth with both hands.* "Oh my gosh-"

Lance: *He looked at Luna in a curious manner, keeping his child-like smile.* "Wat's up with you?"

Luna: "I-I use my parents' Hi-Ougi?!"

Lance: "Wait a minute?" *He looked up in recollection, causing him to chuckle in disbelief.* "Kool!"

Leon: "You do?" *He smiled in a proud manner.*

Lance: "By the way, unless this is a plot twist, pretty sure we got the same parents, aye."

Luna: "Aha, yeah, I mean, I use our parent's thingo."

Lance: "Mine's better-" *He nodded his head and looked at Leon, frowning in excitement.* "Next?!"

--

Kairi: "Th-That was amazing."

Leon: "When we used the Hi-Ougi, I could feel-. I love you too."

Kairi: "Heh-" *She chuckled in astonishment as if she was unsure what to say.*

Leon: *He gently held the side of Kairi's head, kissing her on the lips.* "Also, lance and staffs are my favourite weapons."

Kairi: "Umm, mood kill?" *She leant back as if she didn't understand what Leon was talking about.*

Leon: *He nudged his head to the floating white orbs and smiled, placing his hand on Kairi's belly.* "Lance."

Kairi: "Lance?"

Leon: "Lance Lighten."

Kairi: "Why does he get your last name?"

Leon: *He looked surprised.* "O-Oh, well, we could pick your-"

Kairi: *She looked at Leon with a widening smile.* "I love it."

--

Lance: "So, I'm named after a captain that got KO'd?" *He sounded disappointed.*

Leon: "Haha, no. You're named after one of my favourite weapons."

Luna: "Could've been worse. He could've called you staff."

Lance: "Ahahaha, true."

Leon: "Staff Lighten? I like it."

Luna and Lance: "Ahaha."

Leon: *He smiled, looking at Luna.* "And, if you didn't notice, your mother liked to look at the stars."

Luna: "Luna.. Yeah." *She smiled in realisation.*

Lance: "Staff and Star Lighten?"

Leon: "Hahaha."
Luna: "Ahahaha."

--

Madora: *She watched Kairi and Leon float in a swirl of aurora coloured lights.* "Everything you need in Dee Highs is there for you."

*Madora spoke with a smile, listening to chime-like noises.*

Kairi: "Thank you, Madora."

Leon: "I hardly know you, but I owe you!"

Madora: (When the prophecy comes into motion, you'll unintentionally repay me back tenfold.)

--

Leon: "And that's it."

Lance: *He whistled and started to clap his hands as if he just watched a play.* "Encore, encore."

Luna: "Aha, sounding like Lezard."

Leon: "Haha, I'm glad you liked it."

Lance: "It's been a privilege, I truly mean that."

Luna: "Yeah.." *She spoke with enthusiasm as if she couldn't add anything else.*

*White orbs started to float off Leon's shoulders, causing him to stare at Lance and Luna in an urgent manner.*

Leon: "Could you please tell Kairi-, mum, birth-giver, that I love her, and I'll always be waiting for her, for all eternity?"

Luna: *She noticed the white orbs, causing her to shake her head.* "N-No-"

Lance: "R-Right-" *He nodded his head as if he understood Leon's time was up.* "Waitin' for her where?"

Leon: "The Astral Plains." *He smiled at Lance.*

Lance: "Wat if she, ya know, kicks the bucket over there?"

Luna: "Oi?!"

Leon: "Once another doorway has been opened and an object she's touched, the same thing will happen as it did me."

Lance: "OK." *He looked relieved and sad at the same time.*

Luna: "I-Is there anything else?" *She sounded disappointed as if she accepted the fact Leon was leaving.*

Leon: "Yes-" *He took several steps towards the bed.* "I just wanted to say, how proud I am of you two."

*Lance and Luna gasped, staring at Leon speechless.*

Leon: "There is nothing mere words could begin to describe how happy I am, to see my two beautiful children grow up into these." *He motioned his hand at Lance and Luna.*

Lance: (I'm going to be really annoyed if I find myself wakin' up or something-)

Leon: "Lance, you've become such a strong, powerful man."

Lance: *Tears of happiness ran down his face.* "Y-Yeah."

Leon: "You remind me of myself and I am honoured to call you my son."

Lance: "Th-Thanks, dad." *He spoke with quivering lips as if Leon's words meant a lot to him.*

Leon: *He smiled and glanced at Luna, causing her to instantly burst into tears.* "And, Luna. You've become such a beautiful, well-stabled woman. You remind me so much of your mother-"

Luna: *She whimpered and nodded her head, trying to wipe away the tears.* "Yes."

Leon: "And like Lance. I am honoured to call you my daughter-"

Luna: *She watched Leon's body glow white, as he floated higher off the floor.* "Dad-" *She whimpered with joy, causing Lance to wrap his arm around her for comfort.*

Leon: "I love you both. Stay on the path you two have finally found, and continue to aim forward." *His body disintegrated into white orbs, before floating up through the roof.*

Lance: "I love you too, dad." *He intensely stared at the roof, watching the last white orb leave his sight.*

Luna: "You too." *She looked up, causing her tears to drip off her cheeks.*

Lance: *He rubbed Luna's arm, causing her to lean on his chest.* "Wow-"

Luna: "Y-Yeah." *She sniffed, trying to keep her composure.*

*The crystal in their hand disintegrated into a pulse of green dust.*

Lance: *A smile consumed his face.* "Thanks, Luna."

Luna: *She sniffed with a smile and leant up.* "What for?"

Lance: "That we got to see that."

Luna: *She smiled and nodded her head.* "Thank you, too." *She stood up and wiped the tears off her face.*

Lance: *He heard footsteps leave the inn, causing him to stand up.* "I personally think we should have a few more minutes, but I'm tired of keeping everyone waitin'."

Luna: "I agree."

Lance: *He smiled in a mature manner, facing the door.* "Let's go."

Luna: "Yeah."

*Lance and Luna smiled at each other before walking out of the room.*

Lance: *He walked down the hallway with Luna, making his way to the inn's door.* "So, what are you goin' to do when you come back home?"

Luna: "Home?"

Lance: "You know, Dee Highs."

Luna: *She paused and shook her head.* "I can't go back."

Lance: "Huh? Why?" *He opened the door, causing morning air to brush against their faces.*

Luna: "When I had the opportunity to go back. My eyes no longer worked."

Lance: "Oh." *He mumbled in disappointment.* "How come?" *He awkwardly asked.*

Luna: "Because Destiny was either unable to enter the Spacial Funnel, or, she went into a deep dormant-like state."

Lance: "So, that means you were blind?"

Luna: "That's what people usually mean if they say their eyes don't work." *She smiled, hiding her disappointment.*

Lance: "Oh." *He awkwardly smiled, watching the large cluster of party and guild members wait around a massive purple glyph.*

Luna: *She slowly walked across Surpreon's central towards the party.* "Could you please tell mum that I love her, and I miss her, too?"

Lance: "You didn't even have to ask." *He spoke as if he was already going to tell her that.*

Luna: "Thanks."

Lance: "Anytime, aye."

Luna: "When did you get so mature?"

Lance: "Probably around the same time you actually became fun to talk to."

Luna: "Pssht." *She smiled and walked up to the guild, catching their attention.*

Lezard: "Look at us, we're all matching in uniform! It feels like we're getting ready for school, bwarharh!"

PKMY: "Took your bloody time!"

Lance: "Sorry, the traffic was pretty bad, aye."

Luna: "Aha."

PKMY: "Idiots.."

Lance: "Oi, we're not numptys."

Luna: "Aha-"
PKMY: "Wat-?!"

Season: "Now that we're all here." *He stepped forward, purposely interrupting the conversation.*

Teresa: "Indeed. It is time for us to go to Silver Wind Island."

Holland: *He sniffed the air and sighed in a satisfied manner.* (I like the smell of the morning air.)

Lezard: *He moaned, as he stretched his back.* "Everyone all set?"

Rachael: "Yep." *She formed a fist in determination and looked to the side, watching Luna walk up to her.* "You okay?"

Luna: "Yeah. Thanks, Rach."

Lance: *He walked up to Alicia and held her hand.* "Wat are we waitin' on? I've been waiting for ages."

PKMY: *She formed a fist and grunted.* "We've been waiting for you!"

Lance: "Blarh blarh blarh-" *He rolled his eyes and opened and closed his hand, implying PKMY never shuts up.*

PKMY: "That's it! I'm punching you in the face!" *She stepped away from Holland and Pepper.*

Lance: "Sure you will-"

PKMY: "Die!" *She grunted and charged for Lance, forming a fist.*

Lance: "Ah-" *He let go of Alicia's hand and quickly ran onto the glowing glyph.*

PKMY: "You won't escape my fury!" *She watched Lance disappear in a flash of purple light.*

Tyler: *He watched PKMY vanish in a flash of purple light, causing him to glance at the party.* "So, that's our cue to go?"

Season: "Hohoho. It looks like it."

Luna: *She glanced at Ginger with a smile.* "And you thought I was bad? Luckily you don't have him in the party."

Ginger: "Ey, Luna. Logically speaking, I completely concur."

Luna: "Ahaha." *She closed her eyes and smiled.* (Destiny?)

Destiny: *She looked up as if she just woke up.* (Luna?)

Luna: (Thank you for the privacy.)

Destiny: (Yeup!)

Season: "Oh dear-" *He chuckled and watched Rachael's party step on the glyph, causing him to walk towards it.*

Random Man: *He ate an apple next to a villager and chuckled to himself.* "Those are our savours."

Random Villager: *He supported himself on a broomstick.* "What are you talking about?"

Random Man: "They not only helped restore Surpreon but defeated the Consultant, the demon, the evil captains, the shadow bone creatures, wicked Ancioldrants-" *He shook his head in disbelief.*

Impressed But Still Random Villager: *He watched Luna, the last person to disappear in a flash of purple light.* "Amazing!" *He spoke on his breath in amazement.*

Informative But Still Random Man: "I know, at first I didn't believe it either."

Chapter 25: Tales End

Lance: *He slowly opened his eyes and noticed he stood just outside Silver Wind Island, listening to the waves crash in the distance.* "Aye?"

PKMY: *She stepped out of a flash of purple light, standing on the aura-made path.* "Eh?"

*The entire party appeared in a flash of purple light, causing PKMY to look at them.*

Lezard: "And so, the handsome Lezard, our spice, Razzypoo, Loonzamotto-"

Teresa: "If you are attempting to spout every individual here, I may have to end you."

Ginger: *She looked at Lezard.* "Please respond?"

Lezard: *He lowered his head in defeat.* "Lezard understands.."

*The entrance to Silver Wind Island rippled like water, catching the party's attention.*

Nathan: "Luna! Rach! Lezard!" *He jogged up towards them.*

Lezard: "Ooo, Nathapoo?"

Rachael: "What are you doing out here?"

Nathan: "I was helping the tribesman through the Reality Sekai with Blake-"

Blake: *He flashstepped next to Nathan, blowing wind in Luna's face.* "Wazzup?"

Luna: "The sky." *She grunted and felt Nathan's silk shirt.* "Looks good on you, and Ginger-?"

Ginger: "Heard?" *She replied before Luna finished her sentence.*

Luna: "Ah.. Told ya Rach looked good in green."

Rachael: "I do?" *She looked down, adjusting green leather gloves.*

Blake: "It feels sexy, but I totes don't like the material." *He sounded displeased as he pulled on the silk apparel.*

Luna: "Well, it's a refreshin' change from your leather fetish setup."

Blake: "Say wha?"

Ginger: *She fixated her attention to the entrance while walking across the aura path.* (The new door appears to be operational.)

Tyler: (It ripples just like Surpreon's entrance-)

Season: *He discreetly glanced at Ginger as if he enjoyed her reaction.* (I fixed the entrance when it got destroyed by those Darkwings.)

Lance: *He pointed at the stone appearing door, watching it ripple in a child-like manner.* "Wat does that mean?"

PKMY: "Means get inside already-" *She grunted and walked forward, pushing Lance inside the city.*

Season: *He watched the entrance ripple, causing him to smile in a proud manner.* (I personally implemented the formula based on Surpreon's entry, and replicated it for Silver Wind Island.)

Pepper: *She watched Lance and PKMY's image warp and disappear inside the city.* "I say, we're meant to go in together."

Alicia: "R-Right."

Lezard: "Demonic fish-cakes, I don't want to get left behind."

Nathan: *He nodded his head.* "No one."

Rachael: "I wonder what all this is about?" *She looked down, staring at her green, tight ceremonial clothes.*

Luna: "Everyone is all over the place, aye. It just feels so rushed."

Blake: "Rite?"

Teresa: "Nevertheless, I thought we established a mere moment ago, we were to go into the city?" *She spoke in a professional manner and walked through the wall, stepping into the city.*

-

Lance: *He stared in front of him in shock.* "C-Crap."

PKMY: "W-Wat is this?" *She grunted under her breath, watching the party gather around her.*

Rachael: *She found herself in the city and glanced to each side.* (They form a path to the castle.)

Teresa: *She stared at two walls of people standing on either side of the road-like path.* "Hoh?"

Alicia: (They're all looking at us-) *She nervously thought to herself and stepped forward, holding Lance's hand.*

Teresa: *She observed the people, noticing citizens, warriors, villagers, dancers and tribe members.* "We appear to be greeted by a whole diverse of people."

Season: (This crowd is even larger than the audience of Battling Oxident!)

Tyler: *His face turned red, as he looked down to his feet.* (There's so many people-)

Holland: *He placed his hand on the back of Tyler's neck and started to walk forward.* "It's fine, we're all here."

Tyler: "R-Right." *He smiled and slowly walked with the party down the path.*

Ginger: "I am here, too, quickfingers." *She spoke with blushing cheeks, causing Tyler to chuckle.*

Lance: "I don't wanna wear this tight shit in front of all these people-"

PKMY: "Suck it up, princess."

Lance: "Princess, aye?" *He grunted with a competitive frown, slowly walking down the road-like path.*

Pepper: "I say, what is the meaning of this-?"

*As the party and guild walked halfway to the castle, the entire crowd cheered at their presence.*

Holland: (They're cheering us?)

*Pops of streamers twirled above the party, as constant yells of laughter filled the city.*

Luna: "Ahaha!"
Nathan: "Hah haha." *They laughed as they streamers spiralled over their heads.*

Blake: "There's, like, so many peeps looking at us."

Mio: (Embrace it!) *He sounded impressed.*

Lezard: "Ooo!" *He wailed with growing morale.*

Rachael: *She smiled and waved to each side.* "Who else thinks this is rather intimidating?"

Ginger: "It appears Lezard is immune to this degree of attention." *She walked with stiff limbs.*

Lezard: "Thankies! Thankies!" *He blew kisses to the crowd and winked.*

Nathan: "He's rather sociable-"

Luna: "For a weirdo that is."

Blake: "He's somehow basking in the attention." *He shivered in disgust.* "So unsexy."

Tyler: *He looked up, grabbing one of the streamers.* (What are they celebrating? It couldn't be us, could it?)

PKMY: *She suddenly chuckled, causing Holland to smile in response.* (These feelings.. Happiness, rejoice, hope, gratitude.. It's crazy-)

Holland: *He purposely waved to each side, causing the nearby crowd to cheer louder.* "Haha."

Alicia: *She cupped her pendant with her free hand, looking at Holland.* "Tee hee."

Lance: *He chuckled at Holland and Lezard, watching them bask in the excitement.* (He knows how to live it up, aye.)

Season: *He looked towards the castle and squinted his eyes, noticing several figures standing in front of it.* (Madora, Locki, Celest and other people? What is going on?!)

Madora: *She listened to the crowd's continuous cheers, watching the party and guild line up in front of the castle.* "Who would have thought, that we all would be standing here today." *She spoke softly to Celest and Locki, who stood on each side of her.*

Locki: *He nodded his head, instantly fixating his attention to Pepper.* "Thy know."
Celest: "Indeed."

Pepper: *She noticed a line of mature looking people stand next to Celest.* (The Wise? What are they doing outside Valhalla?!)

Celest: "Shall we begin?" *She whispered to Madora, keeping a professional composure.*

Madora: *She raised her arm, cueing the cheers caused by the crowd to instantly stop.* "As word quickly spread, we stand before the savours of peace."

Lance: (Savours of what?) *He glanced at the party in shock, noticing their surprised faces.* (Good, it's just not me-)

Rachael: (Saviours of peace?) "Did anyone else know what this ceremony was going to be about?"

Karol: *He quickly shuffled into the line next to Rachael and Lezard.* "I didn't."

Rachael: "There you are." *She smiled, scratching the back of Karol's head in a sisterly manner.*

Lezard: "Welcome back, little monster."

Tyler: "I-I thought this was just a ceremony of announcements-"

PKMY: (Heh, I knew something was up.)

Holland: (No you didn't.)

PKMY: (Shut up.) *She smiled, focusing her attention to Madora.*

Teresa: "..." *She silently glanced across the party, observing their facial expressions.* (I would not have understood their faces if I had not removed The Grand Seal.)

*Teresa smiled in thought and reached up, placing her hand against her chest.*

Madora: "Before we continue to the recognition, I would like to pay respects to those who have lost their lives!" *She yelled out, as she glanced to each side across the watching eyes.*

Lance: (Ash.)

PKMY: (Mummy.)

Madora: (Tarlea.)

Alicia: (Cliff, Lucky.)

Holland: (Sebastian.)

Season: (Millard.)

Teresa: (Jewel, Cassandra.)

Alicia: (Felix.)

Celest: (Cassidy.)

Lance: *He looked down, frowning in recollection.* (I hardly knew you two, but Brazza and Pickles.)

PKMY: (Hearing their thoughts.. We've all lost those close to us.) *She sighed in thought, looking up.*

Tyler: (I know they didn't die, but Melinda and Twortz.)

Madora: "I wanted to thank all those brave people, those who put their lives on the line."

*Madora shouted out in a proud manner, glancing across the crowd.*

Madora: "They all fought for what they believed in!"

Season: (Mae, Cyril, Ivan.. You would've been happy to see this moment-)

Madora: "We've lost family, allies, friends, loved ones.. And we won't allow their deaths to be in vain! We must uphold this new peace. Break the boundaries between races!"

Locki: *He watched Scoldrant Users shaking hands with warriors and vice-versa.* (And we, beings of the divine light should do the same-)

Madora: "Ignore what we see-" *She paused, placing her hands on her chest.* "We all have a beating heart, inside we're the same! Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs, but don't fall into negativity, you'll be no better than the Consultant!"

*Madora's words sparked mutters in the crowd, causing PKMY to smirk.*

PKMY: (This wave of realisation, it's as if it wasn't clear to them before-)

Locki: "Please, take the opportunity to say what you want to these honoured people." *He waved his hand in front of the party and guild, causing nearby villagers to stare at them.*

Lance: *He noticed the crowd slowly form a circle around them.* (I don't like where this is goin'-)

Locki: "Ensure your words are short, the announcements will commence shortly." *His words caused the crowd to instantly cluster up to each party member.*

Lance: *Several children bumped into him.* "Ah-?"

Boy: "Y-You're awesome!" *He looked up, trying to grab Lance's attention.*

Lance: "H-Huh?"

Boy: "Thank you for saving me!" *He cupped his hands and smiled with a cheesy grin.*

Lance: "I didn't-?"

Boy: "W-When you destroyed that big monster, it was yooh who saved me from being crwushed!"

Lance: "Y-You're welcome-" *His face turned red with modest-like awkwardness.*

*Several warriors gathered around Teresa, catching her attention.*

Teresa: *She glanced at the warriors with an emotionless face.* "Hmm?"

Warrior: *He stood in front of Teresa and trembled in a nervous manner, causing his armour to rattle.* "Y-You're amazing, you completely changed my beliefs on how I should act as a warrior."

Teresa: "Hoh? I am not entirely sure how I did that, but your enthusiasm is appreciated." *She gently punched the armour on the warrior's shoulder in respect.*

Warrior: *He turned around and faced a group of warriors.* "Sh-She touched me!" *He giggled in excitement, running towards his party members.*

Teresa: "Hmph." *She folded her arms and smirked in a modest manner.*

Chief: *He walked up to Blake, Cameron, Nathan and Holland.* "I couldn't help but notice your piercings."

Holland: "Yeah." *He smiled proudly, pointing at the piercing with his thumb.*
Blake: "Looks sexy, rite?"

Chief: "I couldn't be any more happier right now."

Blake: "How come?"

Chief: "Look." *He stepped to the side and nudged his head to a cluster of Scoldrant Users.*

Nathan: "Hmm?"

Holland: *He watched Scoldrant Users laugh with warriors and men with lion-like appearances.* "They're talking together?"

Blake: "So wat?"

Chief: "It may not be much, but a long time has passed since we were banished due to our appearance. We can now freely go out and not be thrown out of a city." *He spoke with a widening smile, showing his fox-like teeth.*

Holland: *He smiled and placed his hands above his head.* "I know what he means, Blake. It's good not having to worry about what we are."

Chief: "Exactly, it brings me much joy seeing this."

Mio: (What was with your response?)

Blake: (We both know this is wat I want now. But I want to show that it shouldn't be somefing to point out.)

Mio: (Despite how bothersome you are.. You've come a far way.)

Blake: (Watevs.)

Chief: "My fellow tribe members, enjoying themselves, interacting with others-" *He paused and sighed with satisfaction.*

Blake: "Heh." *He leant on one side and folded his arms.* "True-"

Mio: (I never would've thought I'd see this day in my lifetime.)

Blake: (Hey?)

Mio: (Humans are bothersome creatures. They fear things out of their own comprehension. That fear turns to anger and that anger turns to rage-)

Blake: (I get it-)

Mio: (You humans are so unique. Despite your illogical flaws, you find hope, faith and rejoice.)

Blake: (Fufufu.)

Mio: (Was something I said funny?)

Blake: (This is like totes out of your character. You're starting to sound like my sexy spice.)

Mio: (Hmph. How bothersome.) *He grunted in a deep dragon-like voice.*

PKMY: "H-Holly." *She sounded distressed, catching his attention.*

Holland: "Amy?" *He mumbled and turned around, to find eight girls hanging off PKMY.*

PKMY: "W-Wat do you little fools want?" *She unintentionally frowned in frustration.*

Girl A: "W-We wanna thankya!-" *She giggled and hanged off PKMY's arm, swaying her legs underneath her.*

Girl B: "Bwecause you swaved us wif that fire Rostical!"

PKMY: (Thank me?) *She looked confused and moved to each side, trying to avoid the girl's reach.*

Girl C: "YoU! Y-You ArE So cOoL!" *She squealed each word with a different pitch, smiling at PKMY in excitement.*

PKMY: *She stopped fidgeting and smiled, causing her frown to disappear.* (Why am I happy?)

Girl A, B and C: "Pee-Kay-Mee!" *They all squealed at the same time, causing Holland to chuckle in a proud manner.*

Locki: *He watched the crowd overwhelm the party with a smile.* "..."

Madora: *She leant towards Locki and smiled, staring at the party.* "They deserve it."

Locki: "Hmm." *He folded his arms, nodding his head in agreement.*

Elder: "Alicia?" *He staggered up to Alicia and smiled, staring at the back of her head.*

Alicia: *She spun around and gasped, covering her mouth in shock.* "E-Elder!"

Elder: *He nodded his head and slowly took several steps closer.* "Did you forget something?"

Alicia: "U-Umm." *She looked at the elder in confusion.*

Elder: "Oh, I see?"

Alicia: *She gasped with realisation.* "I-I forgot to see you! The village! I'm so, so, sorry!"

Elder: *He chuckled, spreading his arms in a welcoming manner.* "All is forgiven if you mean it?"

Alicia: "Y-Yep!" *She smiled and stepped forward, gently hugging him.*

Elder: "A lot of the villagers have missed you. Be sure to say hello to them soon."

Alicia: "H-How-?" *She stepped back and looked puzzled.* "How are you here?"

Elder: "That man-" *He looked past Alicia, glancing at Locki.* "He told me, I was one of many who should witness this."

Alicia: *She looked over her shoulder with her mouth slightly open in a curious manner.* (Locki?)

Elder: "I was puzzled at first, until he told me about Valhalla and how he knew you."

Alicia: "Witness what?"

Elder: "I'm not sure. Maybe this?" *He leant back and glanced at Alicia with a proud smile.*

Alicia: "Tee hee-"

Elder: "Everyone seriously can't wait to see you."

Alicia: (Everyone?) "U-Umm." *She bit her bottom lip and looked down to her feet.* "Th-There's something I need to tell you."

Elder: *He chuckled and nodded his head in understanding.* "I may be old, but I'm no fool. I know your heart is set outside the village."

Alicia: *Her eyes widened in shock.* "H-How-?"

Elder: "I used to have your drive once too."

Alicia: "R-Really?"

Elder: *He nodded his head.* "This was before I settled down into The Frozen Backwater Village."

Alicia: "I never knew."

Elder: "There are not many things people regret when they get to my age."

Alicia: "They don't?"

Elder: "But, there is one thing we all regret at this age."

Alicia: "W-What's that?" *She stepped forward, symbolising her eagerness to know.*

Elder: "You regret the things you didn't do."

Alicia: "Didn't do?" *She whispered under her breath, staring at the elder with a dropping jaw.*

Elder: "So, go out and explore to your heart's content. Fulfil your desires, so that way, you'll have nothing to regret."

Alicia: "Tee hee." *She enthusiastically nodded her head.* "Got it!"

Blake: *He looked down and rubbed his shoulder, staring at the chief's fox-like feet.* "Hey, whatever happened to Sebastian?"

Chief: *He watched Holland and PKMY laugh with girls.* "He completed the mission."

Nathan: *He looked at Blake and the chief in confusion.* "Mission?"

Blake: "Remember I told everyone about the phoenix?"

Nathan: "Oh, yeah. And like I said before, that was pointless because we defeated the cause of the yellow-eyed disease."

Chief: "Although that is true, the Scoldrants already stricken with the disease-" *He paused and looked down to the ground, forming fists.*

Nathan: "What was that?" *He spoke with an understanding tone.*

Chief: "Pointless? Hardly. We would've had to deal with them."

Nathan: "Oh."

Chief: "And to answer your question. He did what he had to do."

Nathan: (So, he sacrificed himself to save the thousands of contaminated Scoldrants..? What a hero.)

Chief: "I feel that those last moments for Sebastian, were worth a lifetime of achievements for him." *He smiled proudly.*

Blake: (I don't know why I asked.. It was obvious what happened to him.)

Mio: (Maybe because you've learnt to care about others?)

Blake: (Maybe, aye..)

Nathan: "A lifetime of achievements.. How do you know?"

Chief: "You could say it's a Scoldrant instinct."

Blake: "That's kool. I'm happy for him, hey." *He nodded his head with respect and admiration.*

Nathan: "I see." *He smiled to himself and looked to the side, watching Luna and Rachael talk to villagers in dancer-like garments.*

Tyler: *He held the RPG bag's strap and noticed Simone and Kane walking up to him.* "H-Hello."

Simone: "Hello, Tyler." *She smiled and watched Kane step in front of her.*

Kane: "I just wanted to personally thank you and Lance, for what you both have done."

Tyler: "Thank-?"

Simone: "Our business." *She smiled, watching Kane nod his head in agreement.*

Lance: (Someone said my name-) *He turned around, noticing Simone's hair.*

Kane: "Our business has been booming."

Simone: "Even in these terrible times, it's all because of that fantastic burger."

Tyler: (The Fast Lawyers-)

Simone: "Thank you so much." *She smiled with gratitude.*

Kane: "I completely agree with my sister, thank you again."

Tyler: *He chuckled with modesty and flattery.* "Y-You're welcome."

Lance: *He smiled, observing Kane, Simone and Tyler from a distance.* (I feel pretty good, aye. And I'm not even gettin' anything in return..)

The Wise: *Several members gathered around Madora, catching her attention.* "We are ready."

Madora: "Splendid, should we leave the revelation to the appropriate announcer?"

The Wise: "We wouldn't have it any other way."

Madora: "Please summon her."

Celest: (Summon her-?) *She tilted her head, discreetly glancing at Madora in a curious manner.*

The Wise: "Right away."

Celest: *She watched each member of The Wise close their eyes.* (Do they mean-?)

Pepper: *She raised her arms and noticed several blue glyphic lines, spreading down to her hands.* "I-I say, these glyphs are-?"

*Pepper whispered to herself in confusion, catching Season's attention.*

Season: "Pepper?" *He became aware of the glyphs on her body.*

Pepper: *The glyphs started to glow, causing her facial expressions to completely change.* "I see-"

Season: "Are you okay-?"

Pepper: "Hmm-" *She disintegrated into white light, causing Season to gasp in shock.*

Season: "W-What?!" *He mumbled under his breath and reached forward, trying to touch the light.* (It's warm.. Radiatons-)

*The fading light caused nearby people to gasp and stare at vacant space where Pepper once stood.*

Lance: *He turned around, observing the area around Season.* "Where did-?"

*Pepper suddenly materialised in front of Celest, Locki, Madora and members of The Wise.*

Celest: "M-Mistress?"

Valkyrie: "Indeed." *She spoke with a powerful stern-like voice.*

The Wise: "Th-The mistress!-" *He gasped in disbelief.*

Celest: "It is an honour, mistress." *She lowered her head, bowing down to one knee.*

Valkyrie: *She glanced across the city, noticing the joy-filled environment.* "Thy am pleased with the result."

Lance: *He squinted his eyes and scanned across the crowds, suddenly noticing Pepper in front.* "There she is!-" *He pointed in front of him like a child, causing awkward silence to fill the air.*

Valkyrie: *She raised her hand.* "Rise, Celestiana."

Celest: "Your respect is most welcome." *She smiled, slowly standing back up.*

Valkyrie: "Attention!" *Her voice echoed in a pulse, catching the entire city's attention.*

Tyler: "Pepper?" *He quickly faced the castle, nervously adjusting the RPG bag.*

Season: *He watched the party slowly cluster back together.* "I don't believe it's the Pepper we know."

Alicia: "Th-The Pepper we know?"

Holland: "I agree with Season, her scent has changed." *He flared his nostrils, sniffing the air with heightened senses.*

Freya: (I can smell the distinctive change in scent too.)

PKMY: *She intensely stared at Pepper and nodded her head.* "He's right. The person I sense is completely different."

Teresa: *She folded her arms in a mature manner and smirked.* (I have a feeling, something good is going to happen.)

Valkyrie: "We've preached about equality." *She stepped forward, causing her skin to sparkle in the sun's light.*

Teresa: *She stared at Pepper with a warm smile.* (Her power.. I can not even sense it?)

Valkyrie: "We must show equal respect to all those around us-" *She scanned across the gigantic crowd with a proud face.* "-Despite their appearance or personality traits."

Lance: *He glanced around with a bored expression and noticed everyone's engrossed faces.* (They're all really into this speech. Pssht, I've heard this about a thousand times already-)

Valkyrie: "Well thy believe, we, the citizens of Valhalla should do the same!" *She looked up and waved her arm across the sky, causing several islands to appear in the sky.*

Locki: (What did she-?!)

Madora: (The same-?!) *Her eyes widened and she looked up in shock.*

*People gasped and pointed up to the sky in astonishment.*

Locki: (It worked!)
Celest: (Thy'm pleased!)

Boy: "Th-They're floating?!"
Warrior: "H-How could this be?"
Marcy: "How'sss thisss possssible, flooparh?!"

Valkyrie: "As of this day, Valhalla shall be accessible to all those with good intent!"

Madora: *She smiled and watched the crowd applaud in awe and amazement, causing her to slowly clap her hands.* (I was not expecting this of all things-)

*Several people with radiant wings visibly flew across the sky, causing several women to gasp in disbelief.*

Valkyrie: "Now, the rare and special Scoldrant Users including their distant cousins should know-" *She pointed to several Scoldrants, which loyally sat next to their partners.* "That divine places or cities need a Guardian."

Tyler: *He glanced at Holland for clarification.* "It makes sense-?"

Holland: *He nodded his head.* "It's actually one of our rules, that holy or divine places require our protection."

Tyler: "Wow-" *He smiled with appreciation and focused his attention back to Pepper.*

Holland: (But I don't see the point of mentioning it-)

Valkyrie: "Thy am expecting the tribal elders to organise Guardians for each city!"

Holland: (Really-?!)

Keno: (I don't believe it. What an honour.) *His eyes started to water.*

Chief: (Amazing.) *He unintentionally purred to the thought.*

Valkyrie: "The Guardian of Valhalla was unfortunately defeated by this... Consultant. So, having said that. Thy would like to announce the new Guardian of Valhalla."

Chief: (The Guardian of Valhalla?!) *His body twitched with astonishment and shock.*

PKMY: (Protecting something as important as Valhalla, I wouldn't mind seeing this Guardian.)

Cameron: (Something of such importance, it would have to be Keno, the leader himself-)

Valkyrie: "Freya Breeze."

Blake: *His eyes widened and he stepped back with surprise.* "Who?!"
Holland: "Freya? What?" *He stood frozen as the surrounding party members stared at him in shock.*

Valkyrie: *She clicked her fingers, causing Freya to materialise on the ground in front of her.* "Ah, there you are-"

Holland: *He gasped and touched his chest in shock.* "How did she-?"

Valkyrie: *She stared at Freya in a curious manner.* "Do you and your partner accept this offer?"

Freya: *She nervously looked back to Holland.* (You didn't call me out?)

Holland: (No-?)

Valkyrie: "What is the answer?"

Holland: "I-I-" *He croaked, causing him to cough.* (Freya?)

Freya: (Yes?) *She growled with uncertainty.*

Valkyrie: *She tilted her head at an angle as if she discovered a problem.* "I see."

Freya: (Holland, I don't know-)

Valkyrie: *She clicked her fingers and sighed with impatience.* "You are a Guardian, speak."

Freya: "Speak? I'm not going to bark your reply-?" *She gasped and looked back to Holland.*

Valkyrie: "Do not make me wait. There are other things that are needed to be announced."

Freya and Holland: *They frowned in determination, looking back to Pepper.* "Yes! We accept your offer with the utmost honour."

Valkyrie: "Excellent, off to your partner."

Freya: *She turned around and started to run towards Holland.* "H-Holland?"

Tyler: "Wow, she can talk." *He chuckled in amazement.*

PKMY: (Heh, that's how I imagined she'd sound.)

Holland: *His eyes watered and he bent down with his arms spread.* (I can't believe-) *He paused and coughed.* "I can't believe this!"

Freya: "Me neither." *She ran into Holland's arms and stood on her hind legs, causing Holland to hug her.*

PKMY: *She smiled with watering eyes.* (Holly, Freya-)

Valkyrie: "A significant amount of energy was taken and put back into the city known as Surpreon. The ruler of Surpreon would like a few words."

Season: *The Valkyrie's voice caused him to power walk towards her without hesitation.* "Thank you." *He mumbled to Pepper, causing her to nod her head.*

Tyler: (Season?)

Season: "I would like to thank everyone for their tremendous efforts! We have successfully rebuilt Surpreon-"

*The crowd cheered loudly, cutting Season off in mid-sentence.*

Season: "As ruler of Surpreon, I personally felt in a way, responsible for what happened-"

Valkyrie: "Please go directly to your intentions." *She mumbled to Season, causing him to skip several lines in his speech.*

Season: "Throughout my quest to defeat the Consultant, I have encountered someone, someone amazing."

Lance: "Naww, he's talking about me."

Lezard: "No, it's Lezard!"

Season: "Someone, who I feel-" *He paused and took a deep breath as if his next announcement was important.* "Is worthy to be the next heir to Surpreon."

*Season's announcement caused gasps to be heard from the surrounding people and crowd.*

Lezard: "Definitely Lezard."

Teresa: "A new ruler?" *She whispered under her breath, placing one hand in front of her mouth.*

PKMY: "Bullshit.." *She grunted to herself, as if she didn't believe Season's announcement.*

Ginger: "That is a significant announcement to make."

Tyler: "I-I don't want to work for anyone else.."

Season: "So I would like to officially resign my position as ruler of Surpreon."

PKMY: "I don't believe it."
Ginger: "How illogical?"
Alicia: "He must be joking."

Tyler: *He looked at Alicia, nodding his head.* "It would be a little unprofessional, but I think you're right-"

Season: "And I would like to personally congratulate Tyler Atkinson as the new acting ruler of Surpreon."

Tyler: "..." *He stared in front with a blank expression on his face.*

PKMY: "Wow-" *She spoke out of character, looking at Tyler in amazement.*
Ginger: "Yoh?!"
Holland: "C-Congratulations?"
Rachael: "Wow! Go, Ty!"

Tyler: *He stared at Season with a dropping jaw, as tears instantly ran down his emotionless face.* "W-W-What-?"

Lance: *He stared at Tyler with amazement and shock.* (What a plot twist!)

Tyler: "I-.." *He stood motionless, unsure what to say.*

Lance: *He smiled and rolled his eyes.* (You deserve it-) *He faced Tyler and bowed down to one knee, causing the entire party to do the same.*

Tyler: *He covered his mouth frozen in shock.* "S-Seriously?"

Valkyrie: "Come forth!"

Season: *He smiled and started to walk towards the party.* (I understand the emotions he's probably feeling right now, but he better not make a fool of himself.)

Tyler: *He glanced at the party and coughed.* "Rise."

*The party responded to Tyler's words and he watched them stand back to their feet.*

Season: "Congratulations." *He walked up to Tyler and hugged him.* "Now go-"

Tyler: "B-But-"

Season: "Go-"

Tyler: "R-Right."

Alicia: "P-Please." *She stopped Tyler and looked at the RPG bag, grabbing the strap.*

Tyler: "Th-Thank you."

Alicia: "Any time, sir." *She smiled and awkwardly held the RPG bag with both hands.*

Tyler: (Sir?) *He smiled and watched Alicia give the RPG bag to Season, before walking towards Pepper.*

PKMY: *She glanced at Lance.* "That was pretty cool what you did back there."

Lance: *He nodded his head with a smile.* "Yea I know."

Alicia: (Lance.) *She smiled and bit her bottom lip.*

Valkyrie: "Say something to your possible new citizens as they don't have to follow thou." *She spoke to Tyler, as he faced the crowd.*

Tyler: "I don't have a speech prepared, I don't have anything inspiring to tell you, I don't have the wisdom to awe you-"

Teresa: "A poor start-" *She looked at Season with uncertainty.* "Are you sure this will yield a positive outcome?"

Season: "Yes. I've seen Tyler grow in both maturity and knowledge. I have my faith in him."

Tyler: "But I can tell you why I call Surpreon my home. What makes Surpreon special to me, isn't the idea or resources, it's you. The people."

*Tyler nervously gulped and took a deep breath, purposely glancing at the audience from left to right.*

Tyler: "I'm a firm believer that it's the community which makes a place feel like home. Surpreon will welcome anyone from all walks of life a-and I would be honoured to be part of a growing and strengthening network, reborn from the efforts we put into restoring it."

Valkyrie: "Thank thou."

Tyler: "R-Right." *He awkwardly nodded his head and nervously twiddled his fingers, waiting for the crowd's reaction.*

*The crowd burst into cheers which echoed throughout the city, causing Tyler and several of his party members to proudly smile in relief.*

Tyler: *He sniffed and stared at the crowd with a brave face.* (Ginger and I will ensure that both of our cities become prosperous. Tyler, you can do this.)

Woman: *She smiled and looked at two women next to her.* "Whoever that is, I wouldn't mind him being my ruler!" *Her words caused the two women to giggle.*

Valkyrie: "Thy wanted to introduce thou to the citizens and gauge their reaction. The response was overwhelmingly positive, well done."

Tyler: *He looked over his shoulder to Pepper.* "O-Okay-"

Valkyrie: "Please return to your party."

Tyler: "R-Right."

Teresa: "Humph." *She grunted with respect.*

Season: (Told you, Terra.) *He smiled proudly to himself.*

Valkyrie: "Although, what started most of this mess was the Consultant."

Locki: "A-And the warriors-"

Warrior: "But-?" *She looked at Locki and grunted in an innocent manner, shaking her head in response.*

Valkyrie: "And the warriors who were being manipulated by Ridley."

Locki: (They were manipulated? Thy thought they were just bad, that is why thy was surprised to find them here today-) *He mumbled to himself in respect.*

Valkyrie: "Despite how bad things became, the idea certainly wasn't."

Locki: (Where is she going with this?)

Valkyrie: "So, thy would like to present a new Consultant."

Season: "What?" *He gasped to himself in shock.*

Celest: (Thy don't believe having another Consultant would be the best of choice to make-)

Holland: "Excuse me, but a new Consultant? Won't history repeat itself-?"

Valkyrie: "This new Consultant will be responsible for training."

Season: "Training?"

Valkyrie: "Yes. Training the weak, allowing them to protect themselves and the people around them and more importantly, to teach the way of Remenistal or Rostical to everyone."

PKMY: (To everyone? But not all people are born with both Neurons and Astragons.)
Ginger: "Teaching Remenistal is illogical? You must be born with both-"

Rachael: *She held Ginger's arm, nodding her head with a smile.* "It's all good, Ginger. Let her speak."

Ginger: "Ey, Rachael?"

Valkyrie: "Remenistal, Rostical, it is something that bonds us to the environment. Through my personal teachings, thy will bestow this Consultant the ability to teach all how to use Remenistal, Rostical."

Boy: *He looked up to his father.* "I-I could learn Rostical?"

Father: "M-Maybe?" *He stared at Pepper with uncertainty.*

Valkyrie: "This person will be responsible for forming the warrior-like rankings."

Scoldrant User: *He looked down to a white wolf in frustration.* "So, we will still get taxed?!"

White Wolf: "Garwooh." *He howled in agreement.*

Valkyrie: "Instead of tax. The warriors will be used for communication, between the cities, the taverns and the villages."

Lance: *He looked at Holland, nodding his head in agreement.* "I'm not too keen on this new Consultant thing either, aye."

PKMY: "Yea." *She grunted with frustration.*

Alicia: "But this new role sounds different, promising."

Valkyrie: "This person's performance has been recognised by many well-respected people. So thy would like to announce the new Consultant-"

Madora: "Do either of you know?" *She whispered, watching Celest and Locki shake their heads.*

Valkyrie: "PKMY Seraph."

Holland: "Amy?"
Freya: "Wow."
Lance: "Wut?"

PKMY: "Yea, wut?"

Rachael: *She paused.* (Imagine if I ended up killing her? What would've happened then?) *She sounded annoyed at herself.*

Valkyrie: "Do thou accept?"

PKMY: *She looked around surprised and noticed the staring faces in the crowd.* "Y-You put me on the spot-"

Valkyrie: "Regardless."

PKMY: "A Consultant? I don't think I could fit that role-"

Valkyrie: "On the contrary." *She waved her hand across the city, triggering a wide-scale flashback.*

--

PKMY: "So." *She slightly paced, waving her arms in a teacher-like manner.* "The best way to control your Neuron output for ice element is to control the thickness of each ice shard."

Alicia: "For ice element?"

PKMY: "I mean, each element has different techniques to improve Astragons or Neurons."

Alicia: "You sure are knowledgeable." *She spoke in amazement, staring at PKMY.*

PKMY: "Well-" *She grunted in discomfort, looking around with blushing cheeks.* "Well, good."

Alicia: *She noticed PKMY's unusual reaction, causing her to look confused.* "D-Did I say something wrong?"

PKMY: *She coughed, ignoring Alicia.* "Something like this." *She closed her eyes and raised her arms around her face, causing a blue glyph to glow underneath her.* (I'll need to use over twenty percent to get the right combination of sizes.)

-

Season: "I wanted to talk to you." *He stopped in front of her, shivering due to the cold.* (Her Rostical must be getting stronger, she doesn't show any signs of the cold.)

Alicia: "Sure, what's wrong?" *She gave Season all her attention, hiding her emotions from before.*

Season: *He shook his head.* "I noticed your new attire earlier, you passed PKMY's training."

Alicia: "Yep." *She nodded her head, smiling in recollection.* "She's a really good teacher."

Season: "Really." *He rubbed his chin, sighing in thought.*

--

Valkyrie: "Your training skills have not been matched in generations, so, do you accept?"

PKMY: *She paused and smiled.* "Y-Yes, I accept."

Valkyrie: "Please step forward and speak a few words."

PKMY: *She stepped forward and flashstepped in front of Pepper, causing several backwater looking villagers to gasp.* "I will be willing to train all those who have the drive or goal to do so."

*PKMY nodded her head with confidence and watched several warriors and Scoldrant Users, nodding their heads in approval.*

Valkyrie: "Well said-"

PKMY: "All due respect-" *She half smirked and stared at the crowd, grunting so only Pepper could hear.* "What you said is quite impossible-"

Valkyrie: "Oh?" *She smiled as if she knew PKMY was wrong.* "Thou may go back to your party members now."

PKMY: "Heh, sure thing." *She stepped forward and flashstepped back to the party.*

Alicia: "Congratulations, PKMY."

PKMY: "Thanks-"

Teresa: "I am really proud of you-"

Season: "The Consultant." *He chuckled with happiness and disbelief.*

Holland: (This is my girl.) *He wrapped his arm around PKMY and smirked, focusing his attention back to Pepper.*

Valkyrie: *She inhaled deeply, as the blue glyphs on her body glowed.* (Excellent, things are going according to plan.)

Lance: *He started to pant, causing him to hold his chest.* (It's gettin' hard to breathe-)

Valkyrie: *She glanced at Lance, causing her to look at Madora.* "Please begin the activation."

Madora: *She nodded her head and turned around.* "Of course, mistress." *She spoke in respect and hobbled towards the castle.*

Alicia: "Are you okay?" *She looked at Lance with concern.*

Lance: "Y-Yea, don't worry 'bout it."

PKMY: *She looked at Lance annoyed.* "Don't be fooling the new Consultant." *She smirked and grunted at Lance.*

Lance: "Pssht." *He smirked and glanced at Alicia.* "It's hard to breathe."

Alicia: "Let me heal you-"

Valkyrie: *She faced Locki, Celest and each member of The Wise.* "This vessel, Pepper Captian. Thy would like her to be the aid of Freya-"

Celest: "The aid?"

Valkyrie: "To assist PKMY in her duties. It is a large responsibility."

The Wise: *An elderly woman nodded her head.* "Yes, mistress-"

Valkyrie: "Freya's secondary role will be the communication between Valhalla and PKMY."

The Wise: *She continued to nod her head.* "Yes, mistress."

Valkyrie: "Is this a problem?"

The Wise: "No, mistress."

PKMY: *She placed her hand on her waist and leant on a side.* (You hear that, we're the bosses now.) *Her voice echoed in Freya's mind.*

Freya: "It feels strange and amazing." *She softly growled to PKMY while wagging her tail.*

Luna: (I got an idea!) *She ran towards Pepper, causing Rachael and Nathan to look confused.*

Rachael: "Where are you going?!"

Luna: "Excuse me? Mistress lady, person, thingy?"

Celest: "Thingy?!"
Locki: *He frowned.* "Talk to her with respect!-"

Valkyrie: "What is it thou speak, Luna Lighten?"

Luna: *She looked down to her chest.* (No name badge?)

Valkyrie: "Thy am very busy."

Luna: "The Consultant thingy."

Valkyrie: "What about it?"

Luna: "Nath-, Nathan Brails and Blake Hegarty, their goals align with all the corny shi-, stuff you said."

Valkyrie: "Continue?" *She sounded as if she understood what Luna was trying to say.*

Luna: "They want equality across the board. They need a position of authority in a sense to help achieve that."

Locki: "Do not be ridiculous-"

Valkyrie: "Thou forget, Locki, thy can read people rather well."

Luna: *She looked nervous.* (Man, it feels like I'm standin' in front of the class for a speech, bah!)

Valkyrie: "Thy will discuss this with the Consultant." *She glanced at PKMY, causing her to make eye contact.*

PKMY: (Your thoughts? Yes, I understand! Heh, sounds like a pretty damn good idea, eh?)

Luna: *She looked slightly confused and worried as if she had missed her opportunity.* "But I haven't finished-"

Valkyrie: "Say no more."

Luna: ".. Ah, thanks?" *She awkwardly ran back to Nathan and Rachael.*

Nathan: "What was all that about?"

Luna: "Apparently gettin' ready for a speech, aye."

Rachael: "What?"

Valkyrie: *She turned around and faced the crowd.* "That is all for the announcements-"

Tyler: (This feels like it's a dream.) *He nervously fidgeted on the spot.*

Valkyrie: *She glanced at the party.* "Now is the time to respond to these individuals, let them hear your thoughts-" *She was suddenly interrupted by the loudest cheers caused by the crowd.*

*Each party member looked at each other with proud smiles.*

Alicia: "This feels like a dream-"

Tyler: "Oh my gosh, I was just thinking that."

Valkyrie: *She looked over her shoulder and stared at Celest.* "Go forth."

Celest: "Yes, mistress-" *She disappeared in a flash of white light.*

Teresa: (This happiness is continuing to fill my body, an overwhelming feeling I had long forgotten-)

Celest: *She appeared in front of the party and ignored the surrounding crowd waving their arms above their heads in excitement.* "Please come."

*Celest turned around and faced the castle before power walking towards it.*

Lance: "Umm, OK?"

PKMY: "Heh, let's go, Lance-" *She spoke as if she knew what was going on.* "Everyone."

Season: "My, what have they got in store for us now?"

Holland: "Hopefully food."

PKMY: "Heh."

Alicia: "Tee hee."

Lance: "Pssht." *He chuckled at Holland, walking with a slight hunch.*

Holland: "What?"

Locki: *He stood next to Pepper and watched the party follow Celest into the castle.* (Unusual how a wide spectrum of people, formed such a great friendship-)

Valkyrie: *She closed her eyes and stood motionless.* (Thank thou-)

*The blue glyphs puffed themselves off Pepper's skin like dust and she opened her eyes.*

Pepper: "Huh-?"

Locki: "Mistress?"

Pepper: "Mistress?"

Locki: *He smiled and took a step forward.* "Pepper, let's go." *He started to walk towards the castle, catching Pepper's attention.*

Pepper: *She looked confused and followed Locki into the castle, causing the cheers to become distant.* "I say, what is going on?"

Locki: "To say your farewells to Lance."

Pepper: *She looked shocked, showing a slight sign of sadness.* "Oh?"

Locki: *He started to walk up the stairs, holding onto one of the rails.* "What is the matter? Aren't thou happy? Not many people are blessed with the option of sending their farewells to those close to them."

Pepper: *She silently followed Locki up the stairs.* "No, I'm not happy because I have to say my farewells, yeah?"

Dawn: *She quickly jogged down the stairs and noticed Locki and Pepper, causing her to keep to her left.* "Excuse me! Research and I need to tell the other people from Earth about this departure!"

Celest: *She stood next to Madora, watching the party walk down the hallway towards them.* (We stand on the royal floor-)

Madora: *She admired the polished floors and bookshelves, which stacked against the wall in between the wooden pillars.* (I'm no empath, but I almost feel sad for them.)

*Lance, Alicia, Teresa, PKMY, Season, Tyler, Holland and Freya gathered in the middle of the floor and stared at Madora in confusion.*

Lance: "Wat's goin' on?" *He hid his exhausted state, as beads of sweat dripped from the sides of his head.*

Madora: "This portal-" *A Spacial Funnel instantly appeared behind her.*

Season: *His eyes widened in shock.* (That was almost instantaneous-)

PKMY: "Wat about it?"

Madora: "This will send Lance home."

Lance: "..."

Teresa: "Hoh?"

Holland: "Home?" *He stepped forward as if he was oblivious to what was happening.* "Are you really going home?"

Freya: "Isn't this your home?"

Tyler: "Really? When? Why?"

Lance: "I always disliked the characters that decided to return home." *He looked down with a sad face.* "But, I really don't have a choice, aye."

Freya: "What characters?"

Lance: "In movies, I'd always yell at the screen because-" *He took a moment to hold his emotions in.* "They would sacrifice their power and friends to go back to their homeworld."

Teresa: "Despite your dwindling powers, I see no reason for you to stay-?"

Madora: "Actually, once his Neurons and Astragons reach zero, his body will no longer be able to recover from the devastating power it once held to defeat the Consultant."

Teresa: "Oh..." *She spoke with incredible disappointment.*

Lance: *He slightly smirked with sadness.* "Looks like my two containers broke in order to defeat the Consultant, aye.."

Tyler: *He appeared sad and glanced at the floors.* "I-I don't want you to go."

Holland: "Yeah, who's going to annoy Amy?" *He jokingly spoke with a serious tone.*

PKMY: "Pssht, well-"

Lance: *He glanced at PKMY and continued to stare at the floor.* "Something annoyin' to say-?"

PKMY: *She stormed up and gave Lance a tight hug.* "You idiot."

Lance: *He looked down, staring at PKMY's head in shock.* "Wat's that for-?"

PKMY: *She looked up with glazing eyes.* "You shit head, am I'm not allowed to miss my friend?"

Teresa: *Her eyes watered and she had a flashback of Lance acting child-like at Surpreon.* "I, too, will miss your irritating personality."

Lance: *His lips quivered with a cocky smile.* "W-Well, I try."

Season: *He hobbled up to Lance, causing PKMY to step back.* "Lance." *He looked and stared at Lance directly in the eyes with a serious face.*

Lance: *He noticed Season's serious facial expression, causing him to look worried.* "W-What is it?"

Season: "You're a dirty shit nugget."

Tyler: "S-Season." *He looked surprised, uncontrollably giggling in reaction.*

Alicia: *She smiled, ignoring the tears which ran down her proud face.* (Lance..)

Lance: *He chuckled as tears ran down his face.* "You're an idiot."

Season: "Hohohoh-" *He spread his arms expecting a hug.*

Lance: "You've always been a big softy, aye."

Holland: "Says the one with tears." *He smirked with sadness.*

Lance: "Shuddup." *He sniffed and hugged Season with a fatigued expression on his face.*

PKMY: "So, this is really happening?"

Lance: "Yep.."

Tyler: "This really is-" *He paused.* "Not fair-"

Alicia: "U-Umm, I'm also going with Lance." *The party besides PKMY looked at her in shock.*

Holland: "Y-You're leaving us too?"

Tyler: "What?!"
Teresa: "Hoh?"
Celest: "Excuse me?!"

Season: *He stared at Alicia and Lance.* (I don't know why that caught me off guard. It's obvious that would've happened-)

Alicia: (What-?) *A flash of white light blinded her.* "Where-?"

*Alicia and Celest faced each other, standing in a pitch black room.*

Celest: (I cannot believe you're going-)

Alicia: (I'm sorry, I've forgot to tell you-)

Celest: *Her eyes watered and she nodded her head in understanding.* (When I entered your dream with Arcadia, I felt how much-...)

Alicia: "..."

Celest: (I felt your love for him.) *She thought in sadness, trying to hold back her tears.*

Alicia: (Celest-)

Celest: (So, thy will not make this emotional. Just promise me, you'll be careful?)

Alicia: (I promise-)

Celest: (I love you.)

Alicia: (I love you too.)

Celest: "..." *She sighed, causing the area to revert back to normal.*

Alicia: *She looked around surprised and noticed the party members acting as if nothing happened.* (What was that-?)

*Alicia glanced at Celest who nodded her head, wiping the tears off her face.*

Celest: (I will cherish my memories! You'll always be forever apart of me.)

*Pepper, Locki, Rachael and Luna walked towards the party, catching their attention.*

Pepper: *She instantly walked up to Lance and gave him a silent hug.* "I say, thank you."

Lance: "F-For what?"

Pepper: *She stepped back and cupped her hands.* "Despite your personality, you saw me as an equal, giving me the nickname Angler. Like all my friends here-" *She looked down.* "I will miss you, yeah?"

Lance: "Yeah." *He smirked, causing more tears to run down his face.*

PKMY: "A-Alicia's going too." *She spoke under her breath and looked at Pepper, trying to hide her obvious sadness.*

Pepper: *She gasped and looked at Alicia in shock.* "You too?"

Alicia: *She bit her bottom lip and slowly nodded her head, cupping her pendant with both hands.* "Y-Yes."

Madora: *She started to grunt.* "Please, this Spacial Funnel is hard to keep open."

*Madora's words caused the entire party to silently and individually hug Lance and Alicia.*

Tyler: "You know, I would've said that Alicia was out of your league, Lance. But, seeing you two, it's like watching an unrealistic romance movie."

Lance: "You watch romantic movies?"

Tyler: "Ah, no, pssht-" *He looked to each side while awkwardly chuckling.*

PKMY: (Hehe.) *She smiled, as if she could see through Tyler's attitude.*

Lance: "Thanks."

Alicia: "Yep. Thank you, Tyler."

Tyler: *He smiled and sniffed, looking at Rachael and Luna.* "Rach, Luna."

Rachael: "Hey-" *She looked at Lance with a pale face.* "I just wanted to see you off."

Luna: "Me too."

Lance: *He faced Rachael and Luna and spread his arms, while looking at the roof with a smirk.* "Come on, you know you want it-"

Luna: "Pssht, I don't want no diseases."

Lance: "Oi-?!" *He looked down, watching Luna wrap her arms around him.*

Luna: "I know I already asked, but say hi to mum for me."

Rachael: *She shuffled forward and smiled, hugging Lance over Luna.* "Please say hello to Twortz and Melinda."

Tyler: "O-Oh, me too please."

Teresa: "I believe I realised where this happiness is coming from." *She sounded shocked, placing both hands against her chest.*

Season: "Teresa?"

Luna: *She frowned in confusion at Teresa, as if she was interrupting the hug.* "Random?"

Alicia: "W-Why?"

Teresa: "Because, I have you two as friends." *She looked uncomfortable, causing her to fold her arms in a professional manner.*

Alicia: *She smiled with awe at Teresa.* "T-Teresa-"

Lance: "So ya'll miss us?" *He smirked and stepped away from Luna and Rachael, looking at Teresa.*

Teresa: "Unlikely." *She spoke with an emotionless face and looked away, as a tear ran down her cheek.*

Madora: *She grunted again, gathering the party's attention towards her.* "Please hurry."

*Lance and Alicia slowly walked towards the Spacial Funnel, causing Pepper to step forward.*

Pepper: "Wait, yeah?!"

*Lance and Alicia turned around, facing Pepper with curious faces.*

Alicia: "I-I want to go, Pepper-"

Pepper: *She shook her head and turned around, facing the party.* "Everyone, please place your hands together-"

PKMY: (What is she-?) *She stared at Pepper, suddenly triggering a forced flashback.*

--

Cassidy: "Everyone, put out your hands-" *He held out his hand and watched the party walk around him, placing their hands on top of his.* "Close your eyes."

Locki: "Okay." *He mumbled with hesitation, slowly closing his eyes.*

Cassidy: (I'm good at Spacial Funnels and the materialisation of solid objects-)

*Glitters of light rose up from their hands, materialising a ruby in the air.*

Raphael: (And adding our emotions...)

Lorilei: *She opened her eyes, staring at the ruby in amazement.* "Wow? I didn't use any powers."

Locki: *He stared at the ruby, chuckling with astonishment.* "He materialised our memories and emotions."

Pepper: "I say, I can sense it."

Cassidy: *He smirked.* "Thy'm slightly jealous of your empathic powers."

Raphael: "Don't be." *He smiled, watching Locki reach for the ruby.*

Locki: "Could I take a look-?"

Cassidy: *He quickly snatched it from the air and smirked, stepping back to the edge of the floating island.*

Locki: "What is the meaning of this, Cassidy?" *He shouted in confusion, oblivious to Cassidy's intentions.*

Cassidy: "Sure, you can take a look, but-" *He turned around, spreading his wings.* "Thou have to catch me first." *He chuckled and jumped off, gliding through the air.*

Raphael: "Ha ha, no thou don't!" *He reached into the air and goggles materialised in his hand.*

Cassidy: "Said the wingless one!" *He yelled with a smile, taunting Raphael.*

--

PKMY: (A Crystalline Membrane that stores emotions too?!) *She thought to herself in shock, watching the party gather around Pepper.* (Heh-)

*PKMY smirked to herself and walked towards Pepper, placing her hand on top of the party's.*

Pepper: *She closed her eyes, causing glitters of light to rise into a ball.* (Just like Cassidy-)

Rachael: *She watched a ruby suddenly materialise itself in the fading light, causing her to glance at Pepper.* "What is that?"

Teresa: "The way its Astragons are responding to us, it is similar to a-"

PKMY: "Crystalline Blossom."

Teresa: "Hoh? Indeed."

Lance: *He stared at the party in confusion.* "Having a special handshake to get rid of us?"

Pepper: *She smiled and grabbed the crystal, causing the party to step back.* "I say-" *She swayed back and faced Lance, skilfully throwing the ruby towards him.*

Lance: *He caught the ruby in one hand, looking at it in confusion.* "Wat is it?"

Alicia: "It's pretty."

Season: "If it's a Crystalline Blossom, how will it respond to their Neurons?"

Teresa: "Indeed. There are no Neurons and Astragons in their world."

Holland: "That's a good point."

PKMY: "It will respond to their emotions instead of Neurons."

Pepper: "I say, that is correct."

Alicia: "Let's view it-"

Madora: *She suddenly wheezed, catching the entire party's attention.* "I can't-"

Alicia: *She nodded her head, grabbing Lance's hand in an urgent manner.* "Let's go."

Lance: "Yea."

Madora: *She looked to her side at Lance and Alicia.* "I wish you both a happy and wondrous future."

Alicia: *She smiled and held her pendant with one hand.* "W-We will."

Lance: "For the last time, I'm not interested. I've actually already got a beautiful girlfriend."

Madora: "Oh deary me, maybe next time?"

Lance: "I would, but she's the one." *He whispered loudly so Alicia could hear.*

Rachael: "See you!"

Tyler: "Bye!"
Season: "We'll always think of you!"

Luna: (I'm so grateful I got to spend quality time with him..)

Destiny: (I wasn't expecting him to leave.)

Pepper: "I say-"

Lance: "Bye?"

Pepper: "Yeah?"

*Lance and Pepper chuckled at each other, giving a sense of respect and friendship.*

Lance: (Angler..) *He sighed with a fading smile.* (Everyone..)

*Lance thought with quivering lips, causing him to shake his head and frown at himself.*

Lance: (C'mon, Lance! Man up, aye!)

PKMY: *She observed Lance, causing her to smirk with emotion.* (He's not showing it, but I can feel it.. Heh, just shows how mature we're getting, even Lance.)

Lance: (Don't cry, Lance.. Don't cry..) *He flared his nostrils and held his breath, keeping a straight face.*

PKMY: *She sighed, trying to hide her own emotions.* "Catchya!"

Luna: "Laters!"
Rachael: "Until next time.."
Celest: "Thy will always think of thou, Aliciana-"

Locki: "May the Astragons lead you to a safe journey."

Alicia: *She smiled at Locki and Celest.* "Th-Thank you."

Holland: "Lance, I see you as a brother, and brothers always stick together. So, I'll always think of you too."

Lance: *He stepped closer to the Spacial Funnel and looked shocked.* "Y-You too, bro."

Luna: *He glanced at Holland, raising an eyebrow in confusion.* "So, are we like related now?"

Holland: "Haha."

Luna: *She smiled and looked at Rachael.* "Who would've thought?"

Rachael: *She stared at Ashton's transparent figure.* (Ashton-?)

Destiny: *She suddenly appeared in a flash of purple light, floating up into the air.* (Something doesn't feel right?)

Luna: *She slightly shuffled her feet as if she was readjusting her perception.* (Wat the eff are you doin'?!)

Destiny: (Her Neurons and Astragons! There's something strange!)

Ashton: *He smiled and watched Lance and Alicia step through the Spacial Funnel.* (You finally became the person I always saw in you.)

Rachael: *Her eyes watered as she continued her fixated stare on Ashton.* (Ash-)

Luna: *She looked puzzled and glanced in the direction Rachael stared at.* "R-Rach, there's nothin' there-?"

Rachael: *She gasped and shook her head.* "What?"

Luna: (She sad about my bro? You're probably seein' her emotions, aye.) *She chuckled.* "Don't worry."

Destiny: "Yeup." *She hovered over Luna's shoulder, staring at Rachael in a concerned manner.*

Lance: "I'm really glad to have met every single one of you." *He stepped into the Spacial Funnel before anyone could respond, as tears streamed down his cheeks.*

Alicia: "I wouldn't be the person I am today without all of your influence." *She stood next to Lance, looking at him with an emotional smile.*

Holland: "Oh, crud-" *He quickly wiped under his eyes, preventing tears from running down his face.*

Lance: *He looked over his shoulder and stared at the party, watching their image warp.* (I'll never forget about you.)

Alicia: *She noticed Lance's tears sparkle in the warping light around them, causing her to tighten her grip around his hand.* "I will miss them too."

Madora: *She sighed in relief, watching the Spacial Funnel close up behind her.* "Phew-" (I don't think I'd be able to keep doing this for much longer..)

Teresa: "A large sense of disappointment has filled my body?"

Pepper: *She ran her fingers through her hair, nodding her head in agreement.* "Yeah?"

Season: "..."

Holland: "The party awkwardly stared at each other?" *He sniffed and chuckled at himself, causing the party to chuckle too.*

PKMY: "S-So, what now?"

Holland: "Umm." *He hummed in thought, scratching under his chin.*

Tyler: "I-I wouldn't know where to start."

Locki: "The mistress wanted thou to act out your roles as soon as possible."

Tyler: *He glanced at Locki, sighing to himself in understanding.* "So, after all this, we'll be splitting ways?"

Pepper: *She nodded her head in agreement.* "I say, the sooner we're on our feet, the sooner we could possibly meet up again."

Teresa: "That is the best possible action I believe we could take." *She glanced at each party member.*

Locki: "But regarding Tyler-" *He glanced at Season in a curious manner.* "Since it was your announcement, Season-"

Season: "Say no more. I wouldn't dare dump the title on Tyler without helping him."

Locki: *He smiled.* "Excellent."

PKMY: *She wiped her eyes and sniffed.* "Let's get goin' eh?" *She pointed in front of her like a child, causing the party's dampened mood to brighten.*

Tyler: (Lance, Alicia, I will miss you both-)

----------

Lance: *Dark colours violently swirled around him, as strong winds blew in all directions.* (I'm still not feelin' good-)

Alicia: *She stared in front and noticed a door of light.* (It's getting bigger-)

Lance: "Brace yourself!" *The winds muffled his voice as the door of light blinded him.*

*Alicia and Lance gasped and took a large step forward, as sunlight shined brightly in their faces.*

Alicia: *She glanced around with uncertainty.* (That was a bumpy Spacial Funnel-)

Lance: *He inhaled deeply and sighed with a smile.* "I feel better."

Alicia: *She grabbed onto Lance's arm with both hands.* "W-We're home?"

Lance: *He looked down the street and smiled, nodding his head.* "Yea, we're home."

Alicia: "Tee hee. Dee Highs.."

Lance: *He smirked and faced Alicia.* "Thank you."

Alicia: "For what?"

Lance: "Well-" *He awkwardly looked away.*

Alicia: "For what?" *She stamped her foot, pretending to be mad.*

Lance: "For givin' me the will to live."

Alicia: *She looked at him in shock.* "R-Really?"

Lance: "I wouldn't say somethin' like that if I didn't-"

Alicia: *She stood on her toes and kissed Lance on the lips.* "Be quiet."

Lance: "O-OK." *He wrapped his arms around her and looked in front, staring at his house.* "To a new start?"

Alicia: "T-To a new start!" *She smiled in his arms, taking a deep breath.*

Chapter 26: Closured Paths

PKMY: *She stood in an enormous ball-like room and smirked, staring at herself in a body length mirror.* (Things are going smoothly-)

*PKMY stared at her hair which was tucked under her divine, warrior-like robes.*

PKMY: (All the stuff I had to do-)

*Faint holy-like music played in the background, giving a sense of royalty to the room.*

PKMY: (I thought it would've been harder, but actually it wasn't.) *She reached behind her neck and flicked her long red hair down to her shoulder-blades.*

*Footsteps loudly echoed into and across the room towards PKMY, catching her attention.*

PKMY: *She stared at the mirror and noticed a man in royal uniform stop behind her.* "Report?"

Warrior: *He kneeled down to one knee and lowered his head.* "All the villagers in the backwater village accepted your offer for work."

PKMY: *She smiled at herself in the mirror and spun around, admiring the long green dress she wore.* "Excellent, keep up the good work."

Warrior: "Y-You're too kind, Consultant."

PKMY: "If you've finished all your reports, you're free to take the day off."

Warrior: *He looked up and gasped in excitement.* "I-I can spend time with my f-family?"

PKMY: "Leave before I change my mind."

Warrior: "R-Right away! Thank you!" *He quickly stood up and ran out the room.*

PKMY: *She glanced at the jewellery on her fingers and around her neck.* (Just because I overestimated how hard this would've been, it didn't change the fact how much work was needed to actually get here-)

*Several metallic bangs followed by a child's squeal caught PKMY's attention.*

PKMY: *She frowned, staring at an enormous wooden cabinet.* "Theodore, didn't I tell you not to go near the warrior's armour!?"

Theodore: *He slowly staggered out of the polished cabinet, with a warrior's helmet which loosely covered his head.* "S-Sorry, mummy."

PKMY: *She stepped back and faced Theodore.* "Is this how a two year old should act?" *She grunted in a frustrated manner.*

Theodore: *He slowly took off the helmet, revealing his bright red hair.* "S-Sorry, mummy."

PKMY: "If you're going to be a warrior, then you-" *She flicked her head on a side and her image disappeared.*

Theodore: *He stepped back in shock, causing the armour to rattle.* "M-Mummy-?"

PKMY: *She reappeared behind him with a smirk.* "-Need a shield!" *She spread her arms and tickled him under the arms.*

Theodore: "Hehe, mummy! Stop!"

Freya: *She appeared in a flash of purple light, catching PKMY's attention.* "Amy, and stinky."

PKMY: "Frey." *She looked up with a warm smile.*

Theodore: "I-I'm not stinky!"

Freya: "I recall your odour being very distinctive."

Theodore: "N-Nawh." *He pouted like a child, enthusiastically shaking his head.*

Holland: *He walked into the room and stopped, watching Freya and Theodore arguing.* (My family.) *He smirked to himself before noticing PKMY's dress.* (Wow, she's smoking-)

PKMY: "Wat's new, Frey?" *She smiled, focusing her attention to Freya.*

Freya: "I thought I encountered a man stealing."

PKMY: "Stealing?" *She spoke as if she was going to do something about it.*

Freya: "But actually, it was someone returning lost property."

PKMY: *She smiled, standing in a relaxed-like state.* "Nice-"

Holland: *He took several more steps into the room.* "Wow, look at this." *His deep voice caught PKMY, Freya and Theodore's attention.*

Theodore: "Daddy!"
Freya: "Holland!" *She looked to the side, wagging her tail in excitement.*

PKMY: "Holly." *She smiled and flashstepped in the air in front of him.*

Holland: *He caught PKMY in his arms and spun around.* "How are you, babe?"

PKMY: "Very good. I just completed all my tasks prematurely."

Holland: "Oh yeah."

Freya: "And what about us?" *She glanced at Theodore, who angrily nodded his head in agreement.*

Holland: "So, Amy-"

PKMY: "Yes?"

Holland: "Theo and Freya want attention. What should we do?"

PKMY: "Hmm? Perhaps tickle them until they die?"

Theodore: "H-Huh?" *He gasped in shock, lowering his arms in fear.*

Holland: "Sounds like another adventure." *He smirked in an evil-like manner and lowered PKMY, slowly walking towards Theodore.*

PKMY: "Yea, sounds like fun." *She frowned with a smile, causing Freya and Theodore to slightly step back.*

Holland: "Before we attack you, how is Valhalla, Freya?"

Freya: "Everything is running fine. I've had no incidences with any non-Radiaton beings."

Holland: "Excellent." (I was fearing non-divine people would run amuck in Valhalla-)

PKMY: "Holly?"

Holland: "Yes-" *He smirked and stepped forward, suddenly sprinting towards Freya at incredible speeds.*

PKMY: *She flashstepped above Theodore, causing her long hair and dress to flap in the air.* "Yahoo!" *She dived down and spread her arms, bear hugging Theodore.*

Holland: *He jumped up and tackled Freya.* "If you increase your body size, you lose!"

Freya: "N-No fair!"

*Freya, PKMY, Theodore and Holland's laughter echoed throughout the room and down a massive hallway outside.*

----------

*Tyler and Ginger walked through Surpreon's markets with a sense of authority.*

Ginger: *She looked around in an impressed manner and sighed.* "Ey, Tyler. The Battling Oxident we just co-hosted between our cities was one of the best ideas I have encountered in a long time."

Tyler: *He typed buttons on a digital tablet, nodding his head in agreement.* "It was your resources that assisted me in the development of my plans."

Ginger: *She walked with Tyler towards his manor.* "So, are there any more reports? Please respond."

Tyler: "No." *He looked up and inhaled in accomplishment.*

Ginger: "No?" *She grunted in an annoyed manner.*

Tyler: "Everyone is done, including my project."

Ginger: "Expanding the city's size?"

Tyler: *He looked to his side and stared into another sphere-like central.* "Yes. And to top it all off, everything has succeeded my action plans."

Ginger: *She discreetly looked shocked.* (Like my guild members, he chose illogical actions and ended up succeeding against all odds.) *She shook her head in disbelief, catching Tyler's attention.*

Tyler: "What is it?"

Ginger: "It is nothing-"

Man: *He swept dirt off the ground with his broom and noticed Tyler walking past him, causing him to instantly stop.* "Ah, Tyler. What a lovely day we're having!" *He bowed in excitement and respect.*

Tyler: *He smiled and nodded his head, stepping up several stairs to his manor.* "Indeed it is."

Man: *He smiled and looked at his wife and child.* "The ruler just smiled at me!" *He mumbled with excitement, causing his wife to smile.*

Ginger: "So, what is next on your plans?"

Tyler: "Next in my plans?"

Guard: *Two guards opened tall golden doors for Tyler and Ginger.* "Sir!"

Tyler: "Thank you."

Ginger: "Continue your great service." *She nodded her head to the guards as she entered the manor.*

Tyler: "Well-" *He placed the tablet under his arm and walked down the long red thin carpet.* "I want to somehow enable access to Battling Oxident from backwater villages."

Ginger: "Hermm? How illogical?"

Tyler: "Illogical?"

Ginger: "There would be no funds from those type of villages, please respond?!"

Tyler: "My logic is that people who are gifted are able to enter without worries of currency."

Ginger: "But what kind of gifted people live in backwater villages?"

Tyler: "For one example. Alicia."

Ginger: *Her eyes widened in shock and she shook her head.* "She has Radiatons. She could not have-"

Tyler: "Despite where she was from. She was raised in a backwater villager."

Ginger: *She gritted her teeth and hesitantly nodded her head.* "I have doubted your illogical ideas numerous times. I will support you one hundred percent."

Tyler: "Excellent."

Ginger: "When is this project coming into fruition?"

Tyler: "As we speak. I've already laid out the action plan and the time management expected to my researchers."

Ginger: "And their response?"

Tyler: "They've already given me prototypes of portable miniature glyphs, which connect to the main glyph of Battling Oxident."

Ginger: (He has already accomplished this?! I admire him for his intellect and initiative.) *She silently walked by his side, smiling to herself in thought.*

Tyler: "But, I have personal interests I'd like to research into myself."

Ginger: "Like what?"

Tyler: "Astragon or Astral Projections." *He walked through a solid door, causing water-like ripples to swirl around him.*

Ginger: "Not much is known about them." *She sounded annoyed as if he was wasting his time.*

Tyler: "Exactly."

*A line of warriors bowed down in front of Tyler's throne room, catching Ginger's attention.*

Ginger: "Are you expecting any guests?"

Tyler: "No." *He sounded intrigued.*

Ginger: *She looked at Tyler and then to the line of warriors.* "..."

Tyler: "Rise." *He spoke with a stern tone, causing the leader of the warriors to stand up and face him.*

Warrior: "Your majesty!"

Tyler: "Yes?"

Warrior: "We were dispatched by the Consultant to let you know something which sparked her interests."

Tyler: "Go on?"

Warrior: "It's about a recent number of Astral Projection sightings."

Tyler: "Oh?" *He looked to his side at Ginger with a smile.*

Warrior: "With your permission, I would like my party members to explain to you what was seen."

Tyler: "Of course."

Warrior: "Well-"

Ginger: *She stared at Tyler, who started to type on the tablet.* (He has things in complete order-) "I will head back to Silver Wind Island."

Tyler: *He looked at Ginger.* "Certainly. Thank you for your time."

Ginger: *She smiled and gracefully spun around.* "Any time."

Tyler: *He looked at Ginger and smiled in a loving manner.* "Once work is complete, I was thinking The Twilight Forest for tonight's date?" *He purposely lowered his voice, speaking to her in a casual manner.*

Ginger: "Affirmative." *She touched her arm and closed her eyes with a smile, disappearing in a flash of purple light.*

Tyler: *He glanced back to the warrior who stopped in mid-sentence.* "Please continue."

Warrior: "O-Of course."

----------

*Season and Celest walked through a royal white castle with ancient pillars which connected the floor to the roof. *

Celest: "Thy remember one time, Tarlea was able to explode an Ancioldrant with three of her fingers." *She smirked, watching a flock of doves fly above cotton-like clouds.*

Season: "She was able to explode an Ancioldrant with her fingers?"

Celest: *She chuckled and continued to walk in a professional manner, causing her footsteps to sound like high-heels.* "She was a wonder."

Season: "She was." *He smiled with satisfaction.*

Celest: "Did thou know, there were even times when several members of The Wise tried to explain by facts how she was so abnormally powerful."

Season: "By facts?"

Celest: "They couldn't understand why she was so powerful."

Season: "Did they succeed? I'm curious to know myself."

Celest: *She shook her head and walked towards a large wall of glyphic, ancient-like drawings.* "No, they didn't."

Season: "Sounds like you have an idea yourself?"

Celest: "It's a simple theory. Thy personally believe she just tried her hardest every single time."

Season: "Not to sound rude, but that's a little absurd?"

Celest: "No. She tried her hardest no matter what she did."

Season: "Hmm?"

Celest: *She stopped in front of the wall and looked up, observing the drawings.* "From my point of view, she tried her hardest, training, playing, working, even in her appearance and her children. With every single thing she did, she did it at the best of her abilities."

Season: "But how would that explain her prodigy-like power?"

Celest: "When one goes over their limits, their potential increases-"

Season: *He tugged on his robes with impatience.* "I know simple things like that."

Celest: "Then explain it to me if thou're so familiar with it?"

Season: "When going over your maximum capacity, you become stronger-"

Celest: "Why?"

Season: "Because your limit increases over time."

Celest: "Pushing the limits is no saying. One literally pushes their limits further once exceeded."

Season: "Please explain, what has this got to do-?" *He stopped in mid-sentence and paused.*

Celest: (Did he just realise my point?)

Season: *He shook his head at himself with a slight smirk.* "I apologise. I'm slightly embarrassed I didn't figure it out sooner."

Celest: "As long as thou understand."

Season: "I do. You believe that she pushed her limits for every single thing she did?"

Celest: "And eventually, she was the result of that drive." *She nodded her head.* "But thy also believe she was naturally powerful, though."

Season: "Fascinating."

Celest: "Thou've spent several months in Valhalla researching Tarlea's history." *She looked to her side, watching Season admire the glyphic drawings.*

Season: "Of course. This type of information can't be found anywhere else."

Celest: "Thy see." *She whispered as her attention slowly drifted back to the wall.*

Season: "And what is this?" *He observed the wall and frowned, as if he didn't recognise the markings.*

Celest: "Yes. Thy wanted to show thou these."

Season: "Another artefact created by my mother?"

Celest: "No."

Season: *He paused and silently waited for Celest's response.* "Well, what are they?"

Celest: "These were the first written glyphs-.." *She whispered in amazement.*

Season: "Of?" *He leant forward in suspense.*

Celest: "The first glyphic symbols of the Radiatons, the affinity of light."

Season: *His eyes widened in shock, causing him to quickly glance at the glyphs in amazement.* "But there is no written formula on how Radiatons work."

Celest: "Exactly."

Season: "Why would you show me something so important?"

Celest: "..."

Season: (Despite not having Radiatons, if I memorise these glyphs and incorporate them to my use, then I'll be able to make hybrid versions of light-based Rostical!)

Celest: "Tarlea was amazing, but these glyphs weren't her doing."

Season: "O-Oh?" *He started to breathe heavily due to excitement.*

Celest: "These glyphs." *She placed her hand on the marble wall and ran her finger along the deep glyphic symbols.* "Were created by your father."

Season: *His jaw dropped in confusion.* "F-Father?"

Celest: "It's surprising thou haven't asked anything about him."

Season: "P-Please! Tell me all that you know." *His voice stuttered with excitement.*

----------

*Teresa and Madora stood on top of a large lighthouse, admiring the landscape below.*

Madora: *Her long black hair flapped in the wind behind her.* "I always enjoyed the view from The Elemental Tower."

Teresa: "It is-" *She paused, flicking the curls of her long blonde hair out of her face.* "-Beautiful."

Madora: "Oh deary me. You're not wrong." *She chuckled as she continued to admire the scenery.*

Teresa: "What will you do now?"

Madora: "Oh?" *She looked and sounded surprised.* "I could ask you the same thing?"

Teresa: "Hoh?"

Madora: "Well, respect your elders." *She hinted for Teresa to answer first.*

Teresa: "Precisely." *She looked at Madora with respect and nodded her head.* "I wish to explore the unknown."

Madora: "So after all you've been through, you just want to travel?"

Teresa: "Not necessarily travel, but the idea of exploring new things-.." *She looked up to the sky with a confused smile.*

Madora: "Sounds like you enjoy exploring as a hobby."

Teresa: "A hobby? How tedious. It is preferable if it were stated as actions relating to educational purposes."

Madora: "Hmm? So, what brought on this fascination for educational purposes?"

Teresa: "When I explored four of the five Unknown Territories-" *She paused and thought how to word it.*

Madora: "Yes?"

Teresa: "The moment of not knowing what we would encounter was, exciting, thrilling-" *She stopped as soon as she realised how passionate she was getting, causing her to cough with an emotionless face.*

Madora: "Oh I understand."

Teresa: "What about you?" *She inhaled deeply and stood in a professional manner.*

Madora: "Well, I will be retiring of course."

Teresa: "Hoh?" *She instantly lost her composure, intensely staring at Madora with widening eyes.*

Madora: "This last ounce of excitement was enough for my old bones."

Teresa: "But, who will be in charge of the prophecies?!"

Madora: "Well-"

Teresa: "You can not leave the responsibilities that you have-"

Madora: "Teresa-"

Teresa: "Do you understand what could happen if you just retired! This is not-"

Madora: "Teresa."

Teresa: "If people dropped their responsibilities because an ounce of excitement detoured them away, then-"

Madora: "Terra Seraph!"

Teresa: *She looked startled and stopped.* "What?"

Madora: "I have chosen a predecessor to fill my position in."

Teresa: *She looked at Madora with dissatisfaction.* "Although that is better. Your responsibilities are far too great for just any person to fill in. Who is this person? I shall evaluate them immediately."

Madora: "You of course." *She smiled, as if it was a gift for Teresa.*

Teresa: "I desire to see this person now."

Madora: (She didn't even register what I said-) "I chose you as my predecessor."

Teresa: "I-? Me-?" *She looked shocked and stepped back.* "I believe the wind blew into my ears and I heard you incorrectly, who?"

Madora: "You."

Teresa: "I do not know."

Madora: "It was splendid when you told me about your thrill of discovering new things."

Teresa: "But, there is a large significance in difference between the two."

Madora: "What about the learning of future prophecies, events that have yet to pass in time's motion?"

Teresa: "Being a guardian of prophecies requires great power."

Madora: "Deary? Where are you going with this?"

Teresa: "You are the master of Astragons-"

Madora: "You are quite powerful yourself?" *She looked confused as if she didn't know where Teresa was going with the conversation.*

Teresa: "Indeed I am. But, the power of aurora, not even I can obtain such power."

Madora: *She chuckled, catching Teresa's attention.* "Did Ridley Enforcer not obtain aurora powers too?"

Teresa: "Yes.." *She spoke under her breath as if she wanted to ask Madora that question.*

Madora: "Aurorions is merely the power of light and dark."

Teresa: "Dark?" *She shook her head, frowning at Madora in confusion.* "How can darkness be part of the aurora power?!"

Madora: "Without light, you've got no life. And without darkness, you've got no soul. Both are needed to become whole."

Teresa: "Whole?" *She spoke under her breath, staring at Madora with widening eyes.* "N-Nevertheless, I do not see your point in telling me. I do not possess-"

Madora: *She waved her hand past Teresa's face, causing her eyes to shine gold.* "Radiatons?"

Teresa: "Tcch, I do not possess Shadiatons-"

Madora: "Why are you so offended by such a thing? Like I said before, power of light and dark is needed."

Teresa: "I will not allow darkness to consume my heart!"

Madora: "Oh, deary.. Remember the orb you kept for Joy?"

Teresa: "Orb?" *She sounded confused, suddenly triggering flashbacks of the black orb.* "Hoh?"

Madora: *She chuckled again, nodding her head for confirmation.* "Yes.."

Teresa: "Then?" *She looked at her hands with widening eyes.*

Madora: "You are the perfect candidate to take over from me."

Teresa: (Now that I think about it.. Did she plan this from the start?)

Madora: "What do you say, deary?"

Teresa: *She stared at her hands, smiling in thought.* (Without light, you've got no life. And without darkness, you've got no soul. Both are needed to become whole?)

Madora: "Well, what are your thoughts? Help a dear old friend out?"

Teresa: *She raised her arm and formed a fist, looking at Madora in confidence.* "Of course! I just calculated that I would be the best suitable person to do this."

Madora: *She discreetly smirked and placed her hand over Teresa's fist.* "Excellent-"

Teresa: "When will I start? Will there be training involved? What are the correct procedures for me to utilise-"

Madora: "We will begin whenever you're ready. I will personally train you with hands-on experience and I'll teach you those procedures as we go. Later, we will strengthen your dormant Shadiatons and begin the process of integration with your Radiatons. Mastery of each stage are steps closer to using Aurorions."

Teresa: "Then, I would like to start effective immediately."

Madora: "Great?! Ready?"

Teresa: "Of course-"

Madora: "Excellent-" *A swirl of aurora blurred the environment around her.*

Teresa: (I can not wait-) *She smiled as the aurora blew her hair to each side.* "I send you my gratitude."

Madora: "No, thank you."

*Teresa and Madora disappeared off the lighthouse in a flash of rainbow coloured light.*

----------

*A massive crowd gathered around a large water fountain in front of Joy, Lupton and Chrisma.*

Lupton: "And stab!" *He poked himself in the chest, causing the crowd to gasp and lean back in shock.* "That's when she pierced me with her whip!"

Woman: *She held a baby in her arms, staring at Lupton with astonishment.* "You're strong! You deflected one of her attacks with your Pentarang!"

Lupton: "I do try!"

Girl: *She glanced at Joy.* "P-Pwease continue with the story where you encountered the number one!"

Joy: "I'll be happy to explain what happened." *She smiled and looked up with recollection.*

Man: *He sat on the stone ground with his legs crossed.* "Chrisma-"

Chrisma: "What is it, you little git?" *She groaned with a smile, giving him her attention.*

Man: "Tell us more about the other world." *He spoke in amazement, as a line of guys enthusiastically nodded their heads in agreement.*

Chrisma: "Well, with these ten-foot weapons that shot out explosions of dark liquid, I was able to defeat the enemies which swarmed around me."

Man: "Th-The dark liquid?"

Chrisma: "The dark liquid which drained Neurons instantly!" *A woman gasped.* "Yes, instantly!"

Lezard: *He hobbled towards Chrisma, Joy and Lupton.* "Good morning, my delicious sausages!"

Chrisma: "My love!"
Lupton: *He stood up with a smile.* "Lezard!"

Joy: "Wow-" *She spoke with a warm smile and slowly leant up onto her feet.* "It's fantastic to see you again."

----------

*Pepper and Locki walked through a flowery meadow which visibly floated above the ocean.*

Pepper: "I hope this hasn't been an inconvenience to you, yeah?" *She looked at him worried.*

Locki: "Inconvenience? It's not often one's lover is the mistress of Radiatons." *He smirked in amazement, causing Pepper to smile.* "No person has survived a decapitation of their head before."

Pepper: *She nodded twice in agreement.* "We owe her a great deal."

Locki: "You have no idea."

Pepper: "Now that her power has started to become dormant, what will we do now?"

Locki: (The mistress' power becoming dormant, it started to happen once peace spread across the lands-)

Pepper: "I say, Locki?"

Locki: "Hmm?"

Pepper: "What should we do now?"

Locki: "Well, I had something in mind before.." *He stopped and turned his back on Pepper, as a warm breeze blew across the meadow.*

Pepper: "Before?"

Locki: "Before you were banished from Valhalla."

Pepper: *She stared at Locki's back before looking down to the swaying flowers.* "Speaking of such. Why did my body revert to a younger state?"

Locki: *He looked down and inhaled.* "Perhaps a result of your Radiatons being sealed?" *He sounded disappointed, catching Pepper's attention.*

Pepper: "Probably-" *She looked up, staring at Locki's back in confusion.* "I say, why do you sound disappointed?"

Locki: "Because, I wanted to reveal my plans to you."

Pepper: "Oh? Tell me, yeah?"

Locki: *He shuffled through his armour and robes.* "Well-"

Pepper: *She took several steps towards him, reaching out to touch his arm.* "Are you hiding something?"

Locki: "It was hard to craft this, but it took me a while." *He turned around, cupping his hands with a smile.*

Pepper: *She leant back slightly nervous.* "What is it, Locki?"

Locki: *He silently bowed to one knee and raised his arms.* "Will you marry me?" *He spread his hands and a crystal ring materialised in the air.*

Pepper: "H-Huh-?"

Locki: "This was crafted from the condensed sands of The Swirling Marshes, forged by the purest of Radiatons."

*Light flickered around the ring, causing rainbow coloured beams to shine in front of Locki.*

Pepper: *One of the beams shined on her face, causing her skin to glow different colours.* "L-Locki?"

Locki: "What is your answer?"

Pepper: "I say."

Locki: *His heart visibly pumped through his chest.* (The suspense!)

Pepper: "Yes."

Locki: *He laughed in amazement and reached up, gently grabbing the ring in one hand.* "May I?" *He looked at Pepper's hand then to the ring.*

Pepper: *She sighed in disbelief and reached out, presenting her hand to Locki.* "W-When did you intend to do this?" *She watched him elegantly slide the ring on her finger.*

Locki: "As I said, before you were banished." *He helped himself up and stepped closer to Pepper.*

Pepper: "Oh-"

Locki: "I love you, Pepper Captian."

Pepper: "I love you too, Locki-"

Locki: *He kissed her before she finished off her sentence.* (I've never been so happy.)

----------

*Alicia opened the screen door and took a deep satisfying sigh, stepping inside the house.*

Kairi: "Oh? Alicia, is that you?" *She opened the oven and checked the roast, causing the aroma to fill the kitchen.*

Alicia: "Y-Yep."

Kairi: "How were the kids at work today?"

Alicia: "They were great." *She smiled and hobbled towards the couch.* "The staff handed out the childcare awards today."

Kairi: "Oh? How did it go?" *She smiled and closed the oven, walking towards the sink.*

Alicia: "Well, they wanted to give me all the awards, so it was a little awkward."

Kairi: "Hehe, did they?"

Alicia: "Yep. I'm really excited about the progress the children are making."

Kairi: "I'm really happy with the progress you're making."

Alicia: "Oh, what do you mean?"

Kairi: "Well, you've only been caring for the children for a few months and you're already been regarded as one of the best."

Alicia: *She smiled and sat down in the chair.* "I'm just happy I get to do what I enjoy."

Kairi: "Well, it's good that you happen to enjoy children. You'll be having your own in a few months."

Alicia: *She looked down and rubbed her bulging belly.* "Y-Yep." *She bit her bottom lip in excitement and touched the remote, turning on the TV.*

Kairi: "So, Alicia."

Alicia: "Yes?"

Kairi: "Lance has been very secretive about what you're going to name him." *She hinted as she started to wash up the dishes.*

Alicia: "S-Sorry, can't tell you. I promised him."

Kairi: *She lowered her head to the sink and chuckled.* "Okay, okay. I respect that."

Alicia: "Tee hee, yep-" *She looked down in shock, causing her to quickly place her hand on her belly.* "He just kicked."

Kairi: "Sounds like he's going to be a strong boy."

Alicia: "Y-Yes." *She spoke with a smile.*

Anchor Man: "And here comes Lance Lighten!" *The man's voice drew Alicia's attention towards the TV.*

Alicia: "M-Mum, Lance is on."

Kairi: *She quickly walked out of the kitchen and stared at the TV.* "Turn it up." *She spoke in excitement, drying a plate with a cloth.*

Alicia: "R-Right." *She quickly pushed the buttons on the remote, turning up the volume.*

Anchor Man: "And the conclusion of Lance's current case has just finished. If any of you don't know already, Lance has become one of the best lawyers in the state. We will find out the results after these testimonials." *The screen changed shot to a young teenager.*

Boy: "I-If it wasn't for Lance, I would still be school-less."

Anchor Man: *He nodded his head and stepped closer, holding the microphone up.* "Please care to explain what he did?"

Boy: "Well. I've been picked on by this bully for some time."

Anchor Man: "But don't we all?"

Boy: *He awkwardly paused in response.* "Well, the last straw was when his friend's video recorded the bully punching me in the face for no reason."

Anchor Man: "Hm hm." *He nodded his head.*

Boy: "And, I decided to defend myself after months of discrimination."

Anchor Man: "Discrimination?"

Boy: "Because of my larger size." *He looked down, causing the shot to reveal his large posture.*

Anchor Man: "Oh yes, please continue."

Boy: "Well, after I fought back. I ended up getting suspended too. No schools would accept me due to the evidence of me fighting back. So, Lance fought for me, and told the high council my side of the story."

Anchor Man: *He looked to the screen and inhaled.* "And after Lance's help, this young teenager was able to get re-enrolled into the school district department."

Boy: "Thank you, Lance!"

Anchor Man: "And there you have it, just one of Lance Lighten's many cases!"

Alicia: (Lance..) *She smiled, watching the screen switch back to the courthouse.*

Anchor Man: "Now, this case was one of Lance's heaviest trials, as it impacted a large number of people. To keep you updated, this case is involving child abuse." *He turned around and watched a growing crowd gather in front of the courthouse.*

Kairi: "This is a big one." *She looked worried and sat on the arm of the chair next to Alicia.*

Alicia: *She enthusiastically nodded her head in agreement.* "Once Lance found out about the cases of children being abused in carers, schools or even at homes, he looked at me and said he had to do something about it."

Kairi: *She smiled proudly.* "If he wins or loses this case, I'm happy for him."

Alicia: "Even the awareness brought forth from this case could create massive change to the way things are done."

Kairi: "Definitely."

Anchor Man: "News just in-" *He looked up and placed his hand on his ear, as if he was listening through an earpiece.* "It seems, Lance has won another case!"

*The crowd behind him cheered and raised signs above their heads in excitement.*

Anchor Man: "And-" *He turned around and watched Lance storm out of the courthouse, dressed in an expensive looking suit.* "Here he is!"

Lance: *He walked straight up to the Anchor Man, keeping a professional-like composure.* "Yes?"

Anchor Man: "Please tell the public what happened?"

Lance: "This case was unique. I wasn't up against a specific person, but, I fought for an idea."

Anchor Man: "Oh? How does this relate to child abuse?"

Lance: "The issue is-"

Kairi: "It was a huge adjustment for me when I transferred here with Leon." *She softly spoke to Alicia while reading the subtitles from Lance's interview.*

Alicia: "What suddenly brought this up?" *She spoke with respect without looking away from the screen.*

Kairi: "With my grandson on the way, I'm just envious how well you've settled in."

Alicia: "It's been quite a few years, right? Of course, I would have settled by now."

Kairi: "It took me many years to adjust to this world. Without using my wind abilities, it's like when you've torn a muscle, you don't realise how often you use it until it's inaccessible."

Alicia: "I've got Lance."

Kairi: "I had Leon, there shouldn't be much of a difference between-"

Alicia: "Tee hee." *Her giggle interrupted Kairi's sentence.*

Kairi: "What is it?"

Alicia: "There's a huge difference between our experiences." *She spoke with a smile and rested her arms on her belly.*

Kairi: *She glanced at Alicia before focusing back to the screen.* "And that is?"

Alicia: "I don't only have Lance, but I also have you to guide me."

Kairi: *She smiled and leant to the side, placing her hand on top of Alicia's.* "Thank you so much. You've got a really beautiful energy, you know that-?"

Anchor Man: "Wow, simply amazing-" *He glanced back to the screen.* "That was Lance Lighten for you."

Lance: "No worries." *He nodded his head and readied to walk out of shot.*

Anchor Man: *He quickly faced Lance and stepped forward.* "What have you got next?"

Lance: *He stopped and lowered his head to the microphone.* "The next few cases of interest, are those with disorders or problems which are stereotypically overlooked."

Anchor Man: "I know you're in a hurry, but you mind letting us quickly know?"

Lance: "For example, I came across a young woman who had an addiction."

Anchor Man: "An addiction?"

Lance: "Details are not important, but she did the right thing and started undergoing counselling."

Anchor Man: "Yes?" *He spoke with uncertainty, slowly nodding his head.*

Lance: "But, the government that funds the program encountered a problem, which resulted in the institution closing down."

Anchor Man: "What happened to this woman?"

Lance: "She eventually satisfied her addiction, causing her to lose her home and loved ones."

Anchor Man: "I see, looks like another hard case to take on."

Lance: "If it isn't hard, then it's not worth it." *He nodded his head.* "Thank you for having me." *He looked past the screen and started to walk away.*

Kairi: *She jumped up in excitement.* "He won!"

Alicia: "I knew he could do it."

Kairi: (My little boy has grown so much. My young man-) *She glanced at Alicia with a caring smile.* (I really feel like these two will have a bright future ahead of them.)

Chapter 27: Tales of The Rostical Users

*Melinda walked into a massive library, catching the entire staffs' attention.*

Staff Member: "M-Melinda, ma'am."

Melinda: *She smiled, glancing across the library.* "So this is where I'll be having my interview?"

Manager: *She leant back in a chair, shouting out from a manager's office.* "Is Melinda Hambridge, the renown meteorologist-"

Melinda: "Yes, she's here." *She spoke with a chuckle, causing the staff members to smile.*

Manager: *She gasped and quickly ran out of the manager's office, looking at Melinda in amazement.* "Mrs Hambridge! It's an honour to have you here."

Melinda: "It's an honour to be here."

Manager: "The news network will be here within the hour, would you like to go over the interview questions?"

Melinda: "Of course."

Manager: *She waved her hand to a pre-made interview set, making her way towards a couch.* "How does it feel to become one of the world's most renown meteorologists at the age of twenty-five?"

Melinda: "I can thank my mother's support. Some of my fondest memories is working alongside her."

Manager: "How does it feel to discover a new element to physics?"

Melinda: "I'm assuming we're talking about Sceldrant's Comet?"

Manager: "Yes. It was you and your mother that discovered this."

Melinda: "Well-"

----------

*Twortz stormed into a two storey Fast Food Enterprise store, instantly catching the store manager's attention.*

Store Manager: "Twortz!"

Twortz: *She smiled in response, greeting him with a professional nod of her head.* "Hello."

Store Manager: "What brings me the joy of having our regional Consultant here today?"

Twortz: "I finished training up this season of managers, so I'm following up on my own stores."

Store Manager: "Of course." *He stepped to the side, pointing at a small elevator next to a set of stairs.* "Please, let's discuss this in the café section?"

Twortz: "That sounds excellent."

Store Manager: "May I please ask you a question?"

Twortz: "Yes?"

Store Manager: "How did you manage to become so successful?"

Twortz: "I dream."

Store Manager: "D-Dream?"

Twortz: "Those who don't dream will never surpass their own expectations."

Store Manager: "Nahaha, this is fascinating."

Twortz: "Oh?"

Store Manager: "A dreamer? How does dreaming allow you to become the country's best franchisee? You're a multimillionaire-" *He paused in disbelief as if he was overwhelmed with questions.*

Twortz: "Quite easily." *She smiled, looking at the store manager in the eyes.*

Store Manager: "I also hear the Hapkido dojo is becoming rather successful!"

Twortz: "Let's go through what we need first, then I can answer your questions."

Tyler: *He pointed across Battling Oxident, nodding his head at several workers.* "Excellent-"

Ginger: *She suddenly appeared in a flash of purple light, catching Tyler's attention.* "Ey, Tyler?"

Tyler: *He turned around, smiling at Ginger's presence.* "Hello."

Ginger: "Battling Oxident is not due for a while. What are you doing here, please respond?"

Tyler: *He chuckled with blushing cheeks, shaking his head.* "I was trying to implement miniature teleportation glyphs at the end of each spectator row."

Ginger: "Ey?"

Tyler: "That way, people could transport straight to their rows."

Ginger: "It has been said you have reached Season's level of ruling already. Take some time off."

Tyler: "Haha, not quite-"

Ginger: *She took several steps towards Tyler and held his hand, looking at him with blushing cheeks.* "For me? Please respond?"

Tyler: "O-Okay." *He nervously squealed, causing Ginger to giggle.*

----------

PKMY: *She shouted and pointed to each side, causing warriors to help carry items out of a burning house.* "Evacuate the people, then we will deal with the house!"

Warrior: "Ma'am!" *He shouted in understanding, carrying an unconscious man out of harm's way.*

PKMY: "Excellent." *She smirked, watching the fire splinter in the breeze.*

?????: "Ma'am!"

PKMY: "Ah, captain." *She spoke without looking away from the burning house.*

Captain: "What would you like me to do?"

PKMY: "You're the first person I successfully trained. You should know?"

Captain: *He smirked and nodded his head, facing the burning house.* "Power of the deep depths, let my power swirl throughout your spirit-"

*The captain raised his arms and watched a pool of water materialise in the air.*

Captain: *He looked up, staring at the forming pool of water with widening eyes.* "Summon the ocean's pressure and feast on the sacred waters-"

*The pool of water formed into a large whale, causing it to moan in a whale-like manner.*

Captain: "WHALE DIVIDER" *He lowered his arms, causing the whale to dive directly on top of the burning house.*

*The whale exploded into a massive pulse of waves, extinguishing all the flames.*

Warrior: *He stood next to PKMY, gasping in amazement.* "I can't wait to become as strong as him. Then I'd be able to protect my village."

PKMY: "Anything is possible."

Warrior: "A-Anything?" *He spoke as if he was relating it to his dream.*

PKMY: "Considering he was only born with Astragons." *She smirked and turned away as if the job was completed.*

Warrior: *He silently gasped with a dropping jaw.* "He-..?" *He looked at the captain with widening eyes.*

----------

*Holland ran after a young teenager, deep inside an ancient forest.*

Holland: "Now focus on your surroundings! If you can't even catch your Scoldrant, how will you expect to Soul Link with it?!" *He shouted at the teenager's back, watching him sprint through the forest.*

Young Teenager: (I'm trying!) *His voice echoed in Holland's mind.*

Holland: (Not hard enough!)

Young Teenager: (But, dad!-)

Holland: (No buts, Theo! Your mother will kick my butt if you don't succeed.)

Theodore: "Hehe." *He suddenly smirked with boosted morale, staring ahead with heightened vision.* "Got it!"

Holland: (That's my boy.) *He smirked in a proud manner.*

----------

*Season hobbled on top of a massive mountain, taking a deep breath of exhaustion.*

Season: "Wow-, I did it-" *He turned around and took another deep breath, staring at the entire continent.*

*Prehistoric screeches echoed in the distance, causing Season to smirk in amazement.*

Season: "Mount Kingdom Hall. The highest floating island, with the ability to see the entire continent below."

*Season sighed and coughed, wiping sweat off his forehead.*

Season: "I'm finally able to go out and explore... I can't wait to reveal my findings to the world."

*Season smirked, admiring the magnificent beauty below.*

----------

*Teresa and Madora looked at their reflections in the water fountain, watching the water ripple aurora colours.*

Teresa: "Hoh?"

Madora: *She smiled, observing Teresa's facial expressions.* "What did you think?"

Teresa: *She leant back, staring at Madora in a dumbfounded manner.* "What did I just experience?"

Madora: "Your first prophecy."

Teresa: "Hoh?"

Madora: "You've successfully integrated both Radiatons and Shadiatons into your being, allowing you to access the power of Aurorions."

Teresa: "It is intriguing. Having the knowledge of Shadiatons and Aurorions. Why not make it common knowledge?"

Madora: "Some things are better not said."

Teresa: *She nodded her head in understanding, glancing back to the pedestal.* "So-.."

Madora: "What did you see?"

Teresa: "A prophecy involving something called The Dontalia Facility?" *She shrugged her shoulders, as if she didn't know what it was.*

Madora: "What are your thoughts?"

Teresa: "This is the type of knowledge I have always been fascinated to learn." *She smiled, facing Madora in appreciation.* "I thank you, Madora."

Madora: "Oh, deary me. You'll make me blush."

Teresa: "My words are true to their meaning, Madora."

Madora: "Knowing someone like you is monitoring over the prophecies. I'll be able to finally retire."

Teresa: "Despite your intentions, have I learned everything I need to know?"

Madora: "Everything." *She smiled and closed her eyes, alerting Teresa.*

Teresa: "Madora?"

Madora: "I leave everything in your care, Terra Seraph." *Strings of aurora light swirled around her, blowing her hair to each side.*

Teresa: "I understand. Enjoy your retirement, my good friend."

Madora: "..." *She suddenly disappeared in a swirl of aurora coloured light.*

Teresa: *She looked up and smiled, staring at the sky.* "Thank you.."

----------

*Alicia and a young boy played in a flowery bed, listening to birds chirp in the distance.*

Alicia: "Tee hee-" *She wore a large blue hat with a purple flower, purposely avoiding the boy.*

Boy: "Ahaha, you're fast, mum!"

Alicia: *She giggled and swayed to the side, causing her long blue dress to gracefully sway in the warm breeze.* "I wasn't as fast when I was your age."

Boy: "Ahaha-" *He stopped in mid-giggle, watching butterflies flap past him.*

Lance: *He stepped out of an enormous mansion, catching Alicia's attention.* "Oi, look wat randomly responded to me."

Alicia: "What did?" *She faced Lance, holding her hat with one hand in confusion.*

Lance: "Our parting gift?"

Alicia: *She gasped in amazement, cupping her pendant with both hands.* "R-Really?"

Boy: *He giggled, chasing after a white butterfly around the flowery bed.* "Ahahaha."

Lance: *He hopped down several steps, admiring the boy run in the flowery meadow.* "Be careful, my little butt nugget."

Boy: "Tee hee, okies, dad!"

Alicia: *She elegantly sat down and looked up, watching Lance walk towards her.* "What did you think triggered it?"

Lance: *He kissed Alicia on the head and bent down, sitting in the flowers in front of her.* "I was just thinking of all our adventures."

Alicia: "No matter how busy I find myself, I always wonder what everyone is up to."

Lance: "Yea, wonder how much time has passed over there?" *He smiled, revealing the ruby Pepper created.*

Alicia: *She held Lance on the side of his head and leant forward, kissing him with a smile.* "Ready when you are."

Lance: "Oi, I may be all mature ‘n' stuff now, but you're the one that still does this stuff." *He spoke with a smile and looked at the ruby as if he had no idea how to work it.*

Alicia: (Activated by emotions-) *She cupped her hands over Lance's around the ruby and closed her eyes, causing a swirl of wind to blow the flowers around them.*

Boy: "Come back here!" *He squealed with a giggle, continuing to chase after the butterfly.*

*Lance and Alicia gasped and placed their hands on the ground, trying to regain their composure.*

Lance: "W-Whoa-"
Alicia: "W-Wow-.." *They looked at each other with watering eyes.*

Lance: "I love you so much, Alicia Lighten."

Alicia: "I love you too."

Boy: "Mum, dad? Is everyfing okay?!" *He skipped through the flowers, noticing their exhausted facial expressions.*

Lance: "We're fine, my young man." *He reached out and grabbed the boy around the waist, purposely pulling him onto his lap.*

Boy: *He squealed, trying to get out of Lance's grip.* "Ahaha, what's wrong?"

Lance: "It's nothin'."

Alicia: "We'll show you when you're a little older."

Boy: *He leant up, looking at Alicia in a serious manner.* "Why not now, mum?"

Alicia: "There's too much violence."

Boy: "I'm five, I'ma man-"

Lance: "A man? You can't even eat ya veggies." *He sighed and purposely looked away, causing Alicia to giggle.*

Boy: "But, but-"

Lance: "I'm gonna need the help when you get older, so eat your veggies, they'll help ya get stronger."

Boy: "OK!" *He smiled with a missing tooth.*

Lance: "We love ya, Ash."
Alicia: "We love you, Ashton." *They unintentionally spoke at the same time.*

Ashton: "I love you too, mum and dad, aha." *He watched the butterfly flap past him, causing him to giggle and chase after it again.*

Lance: "Watch out for the bees, Ash!"

Ashton: "Yes, dad!"

Alicia: "Lunch will be ready shortly." *She smiled at Ashton, readying herself to stand up.*

Ashton: "Yes, mum!"

Lance: *He quickly stood up and reached down, helping Alicia onto her feet.* "Man, it was pretty crazy back then."

Alicia: "And we only watched a portion of it."

Lance: "We did?"

Alicia: "Yep." *She smiled, holding Lance's hand.*

Lance: "Who would've thought-" *He sighed and looked up, staring at the clear blue sky.*

Alicia: "W-What?" *She spoke with a smile, keeping a discreet eye on Ashton.*

Lance: "That happily ever afters were real."

----------

*Teresa, PKMY, Pepper, Tyler, Holland, Freya and Season sat on differently-shaped rocks on a floating island.*

Season: *He stared at the party and smiled to himself.* (We've been able to catch up for the first time in a long time without being interrupted.)

*Long vibrant grass swayed in the constant warm breeze and the smell of flowers filled the air.*

Pepper: *She smiled at the party and raised her arm, showing off the ring Locki gave her.* "I say, I said yes, of course."

Tyler: *He covered his mouth in amazement.* "That's fantastic."

PKMY: "Heh, pretty good work."

Pepper: "Tyler, I would like you to help organise the ceremony, yeah?"

Tyler: "I-I'd be delighted." *He smiled in excitement, eagerly nodding his head.*

Season: "This is fantastic news."

*A wave of white flower petals brushed past the party in the warm breeze.*

Holland: *He paused and chuckled to himself.* "I can't believe your father created the first glyphs of the power of light." *He spoke with amazement at Season.*

PKMY: "Heh, I admit, I was shocked too, but that's our daddy."

Teresa: "I concur. It would have been most delightful if I got to meet him."

Season: "Indeed."

Tyler: "Well, I thought Teresa learning the ability to see into the future is even more amazing."

Teresa: "Hoh?"

PKMY: "Well, Holly's dormant Scoldrant abilities allowed him to become an empath, that's pretty cool too if ya ask me."

Freya: "I agree-"

Holland: "Oh, you two-" *He waved his arm in a modest manner.*

Season: "So, PKMY."

PKMY: "Yeah?"

Season: "Care to explain how you're able to teach Rostical to people who can't naturally learn it?"

Tyler: "I-I've been wondering that too!" *He faced PKMY, eagerly nodding his head.*

Pepper: "I say, great question!"

PKMY: "Heh. It was the Valkyrie that taught it to me."

Freya: "She did?"

Pepper: (If only I could remember the times she awakens.) *She smiled to herself in thought, watching her long hair sway in the breeze.*

PKMY: *She nodded her head, glancing at each party member.* "The way it works, is that, instead of using Neurons and Astragons, a replica of Radiatons fills in the void."

Tyler: "The void?"

PKMY: *She looked at Tyler and nodded her head, placing her hand on her waist.* "And it's used through emotions."

Season: "Replica?"

Tyler: (Through emotions?)

Teresa: "Hoh? But only divine people can-"

PKMY: "OK, OK, lemme finish."

Holland: "Haha, let her talk, guys."

PKMY: "You're able to borrow some of the Valkyrie's Radiatons if you're pure at heart."

Season: "Wow, I don't really understand how that works, but that's an awesome safeguard."

PKMY: "Heh, you thought so too?"

Pepper: (Even though the Valkyrie has gone back to sleep, her power still flows through the land?)

Tyler: "Safeguard?"

Season: "Meaning, if someone who learns Rostical tries to use it for bad, then this Valkyrie's Radiatons will stop working-" *He looked at PKMY, ensuring his hypothesis was correct.*

PKMY: "Yea."

Season: "So-"

Tyler: *He grunted in realisation.* "So, if her Radiatons work as either Neurons or Astragons, then the user won't be able to use Rostical if they use it for bad?"

PKMY: "This process is far more complex than what we're saying, but, pretty cool, huh?"

Pepper: "Wow."

Holland: "I've seen a lot of heroes rise up from backwater villages."

Tyler: *He eagerly nodded his head.* "I think we're witnessing the dawn to a new age."

PKMY: "Heh-" *She chuckled, punching Tyler on the shoulder.* "Loser."

Tyler: "O-Ouch-" *He squealed and rubbed his arm, causing the party to chuckle.*

Pepper: "I say, as what Lance would say-" *She coughed and frowned.* "We're all pretty cool aye, 'cause we're, like, rockin' these shit nuggets-" *She crossed her arms and pulled an awkward face.*

Holland: "Hahaha."

PKMY: "Pssht, it would be more like, I'm such an annoyin' try hard."

Tyler: "Ha ha."
Season: "Hohoho."

Freya: "Howrooh." *She smiled showing her teeth.*

Teresa: "That is not a respectful way of remembering his characterisation." *Her stern sounding sentence caused the laughter to fade away.*

PKMY: "T-Teresa?" *She looked slightly surprised.*

Teresa: "To be precise, he would state, I am an annoying man-child, then would proceed to do some trivial gesture, then exclaims his need for shit nuggets-"

PKMY: "Heheheh."
Tyler: "Hahahaha."
Holland: "Haha haha haha."
Season: "Hohohoho." *They all suddenly burst into laughter, louder than before.*

Pepper: *She chuckled, looking down in recollection.* "I miss them, yeah?"

Tyler: "Me too."

Holland: "Alicia and Lance-"

PKMY: "I also miss the try hard and princess."

Teresa: "Indeed." *She nodded her head in agreement.*

Season: *He smirked and glanced around before looking at PKMY.* "Amy, where's Theodore-?"

PKMY: "Huh-?" *She focused her attention to Season and silently stared at him.* "Wat ya mean, where's Theodore?!"

Holland: "Yeah, Season, we've been talking for a fair bit now." *He mumbled and scratched under his chin.*

Season: "O-Oh, well-" *He awkwardly looked away and sighed.* "I beg your pardon, I was just actively enjoying your company."

PKMY: "Hmph-" *She folded her arms and looked away like a child.*

Freya: *Her ears twitched, as she looked at Season.* "He's being looked after by Madora."

Holland: (Soon, our little man won't need to be looked after.. Technically he doesn't now. He's already Soul Linked to a Scoldrant. I'm so proud.)

PKMY: *She flicked her long hair over her shoulder.* "How come?"

Season: "I wanted to give him a special amulet which increases the fire affinity by thirty percent."

Teresa: "By thirty percent?!"

Season: "Indeed."

Teresa: "That pleases, Taco." *She clapped her hands and smiled.*

Holland: "Haha hahaha."
Tyler: "Haha ha!"
Season: "Hohoho." *He held his stomach, laughing with his eyes closed.*

PKMY: "Pssht." *She chuckled while shaking her head.*

Freya: "Owooh." *She howled with joy at the sky.*

Teresa: (Ever since the removal of The Grand Seal, my ability to retain memories has been restored back to optimum levels. Although, the memories lost have never returned.)

PKMY: "Thanks, Season-"

Season: "I'll give it to him on his birthday."

Tyler: "Oh-" *He snapped his fingers, looking at the party in excitement.*

PKMY: "Alright, you can settle down now, Tyler. It wasn't that funny."

Tyler: "Ha ha, no. I just wanted to let you all know, that we're three weeks away from another Battling Oxident, I hope to see you all there."

Season: "I'll definitely be there."

Holland: "Me too! I will never miss out on a chance to eat your foods."

Tyler: "Ha ha."

PKMY: "Count me in!" *She smirked and punched the air in front of her.*

Pepper: "I'll be attending, yeah?"

Freya: "Alright, we've all agreed, we'll see each other at Battling Oxident."

Tyler: "I will post the memo to the Consultant-" *He smiled at PKMY.* "And let you know the times closer to the date."

Season: "Excellent-"

*An aurora swirl pulsed around Teresa and alerted her, causing the party to silently stare at her.*

Teresa: "I see." *She sighed and jumped off the rock.* "It is time for me to leave-"

Tyler: *His watch-like bangle started to ring, causing him to whine in a disappointed manner.* "I've got to go back to the city too-"

*A heartbeat-like pulse thumped through PKMY and Freya, alerting them of something.*

Freya: *She stood up and glanced at PKMY, as she nodded her head.* "We've got to go too."

Holland: *He closed his eyes and deeply inhaled.* "I'm currently needed back at my tribe-"

*The party stood motionless and looked each other, causing them to instantaneously smile.*

Teresa: (It saddens me that I will not see my party-) *She paused in thought.* (Friends, for quite some time-)

Season: "One for the journey?" *He spread his arms with a warm smile.*

PKMY: "Until next time-"

Pepper: "I say, which will be Battling Oxident, yeah?"

Holland: "Yeah." *He mumbled with a smirk.*

*Teresa, PKMY, Season, Holland, Tyler and Pepper took several steps forward and hugged.*

PKMY: *She smiled with her eyes closed.* "When did we all get so needy for each other? It's only bloody three weeks."

Teresa: "Indeed." *She spoke with a warm smile as if she didn't care.*

Freya: *She trotted in the middle of the party and leant against their legs, symbolising a hug.* (I couldn't have asked to be in a better pack than this.)

Madora: *She watched the party from a nearby floating island, hidden in cotton-like clouds.* (These bright individuals, I foresaw a beautiful future in all of them.) *She smiled, watching the party disappear in flashes of white, purple and aurora coloured light.*

Michael: "It's been a long and satisfying adventure! So thank you so much for reading this much! Please leave us a review on how you think the ending was? Was it good? Bad-?"

Lezard: "It was bad! Why did Lance want to go back to his world?!"

Michael: "He didn't have a choice?"

Lezard: "Well.. It feels like it's missing something!"

Michael: "What about the epilogue chapter?"

Lezard: "What epilogue chapter? Lezard needs to find it!"

Michael: *He coughed and rolled his eyes.* "If you have any questions, feel free to send me an email. I'm also on Facebook and Twitter! I find any feedback scrumptious and I will always reply back. Hope to hear from you, little silly sausage! And I-, no! We hope you enjoyed this series! It has taken me more than ten years to complete both Rostical series. I honestly hope you enjoyed my life's work and at the time writing this, I hope one day it'll be an amazing JRPG or anime that hopefully teaches good morals or guidance to those that need it! Please check out the extras and credits! Thank you."

Chapter 04: Teresa's Lyrics

Here are the raw lyrics to the song Teresa sung in "Acceptable My Way". Enjoy! If you wish to try and sing this or make an actual song, just let me or Teresa know haha.

The Rostical Users (c)
Intro:
Whoaooh-ooo-ooo-oooh

Some people say I'm cold-hearted
Some people say they're all that
But you know what? I really really don't care!

Verse:
Back in the times, I was told
Only failures make mistakes
Those who were told, that they were a mistake
You fail
'Cause you fell into their ways, hey-aye
Truth is
No one's a mistake, no one's a failure!

Chorus:
You say I'm crazy (unacceptable)
You say I'm sad (unacceptable)
I say, we are who we are
'Cause I'm acceptable my way
You say I'm great (unacceptable)
You say I'm perfect (unacceptable)
I say, we are who we are
'Cause I'm acceptable my way

Post-chorus:
You only like me, when I'm done your way
Just, there's no way I will change, hey-aye
You say I'm fake, 'cause I have my say
You say I'm great, when it's your way
But there's no way I will change, hey-aye
I say, we are who we are, 'cause I'm acceptable my way

(Whoaooh-ooo-ooo-oooh)
('Cause I'm acceptable my way)

Verse:
He says I'm big at weight
But it's acceptable that way (acceptable my way)
She says I'm bad at the face
But I'm acceptable my way (acceptable my way)
If you don't respect yourself
How will you respect your friends
Don't hide or seal your emotions
'Cause only the unacceptable are made that way

Repeat Chorus + Post-chorus

Bridge:
These are my choices, not yours, even if it's gold or bold
Don't opinion-ate if you can't relate
Only relate until you've felt the same heartache
It was foolish to run away
Just because I couldn't relate
Don't run and forget your feelings
Brace all emotions, brace your being
They say, we are who we are
'Cause we're acceptable our way (our way)
Everything happens for a reason
So don't fight it, please don't fight it (don't fight it)

Repeat Chorus

Outro/refrain:
There's no way I will change (no way I will change)
Whoaooh-ooo-ooo-oooh
'Cause I'm acceptable my way

Whoaooh-ooo-ooo-oooh ('Cause I'm acceptable my way)
There's no way I will change (no way I will change)
'Cause I'm acceptable my way

Chapter 05: Karol's Lyrics

Here are the raw lyrics to the song Karol sung in "My Friends". Enjoy! If you wish to try and sing this or make an actual song, just let me or Karol know haha.

The Rostical Guild (c)

"There are days when I'm all alone.
All I think about are the times at home.

I can hear their voice, every time I close my eyes.
I can feel their touch, every time I want to cry.

No matter how hard I try,
and I don't exactly know why.

But.. This void in my heart, just won't go by.
They force hold my hand, even if I don't want to stand.

They make me laugh, even if I've had enough.

When it feels like nobody is by my side.
My friends make that void go outside.

Even when there is nobody by my side.
My friends, make me want to smile.
It doesn't matter if I whimper or even walked a mile.

Even when I miss my family.. They will give me their eternity.
So, I'll try and stand by their side. And I'll walk with a proud and mighty stride.

All thanks to my friends, there's no need to pretend.
I'll keep my head raised up high, till dusk and throughout the night.

I'm happy now and I think I know how.
Always thank your friend-
-Let's try and make it a trend."

Millard: "The magical Millard, luxurious Lezard and lemony Lance-"

Chrisma: "Whoup whoup."

Dawn: "For research!"

Lance: *He sighed, noticing Millard and Lezard's cone shaped hats* "Oi, how come you have the same hat, that's not possible?"

Millard: "And me being alive, is? You little monster." *He sighed with a sarcastic smile, looking at Lezard*

Millard: "Right!"

Chapter 08: Michael's Tale

Michael: "Good evening, delicious readers."

*Michael smirked and sat on an old looking couch, staring at the camera.*

Michael: "I just wanted to say, thank you very much for taking your time to read this adventure together."

*Michael looked down, sighing in an accomplished-like manner.*

Michael: "This series has been my life. I wanted to teach moral codes that seemed to have gone lost in recent years."

*Michael looked back up in recollection, ignoring the shaking books behind him.*

Michael: "All I can ask, from you, the amazing reader, is to spread word about this amazing tale-"

*Several books fell on top of Michael, catching his attention.*

Michael: "What the-?"

Chrisma: "Whoup whoup!" *She groaned on her breath, revealing herself through the shelving.*

Michael: "Chrisma?"

Chrisma: "What's happening here?"

Michael: *He looked over his shoulder, staring at Chrisma in confusion.* "I'm just thanking the readers and what they could do to help-"

Chrisma: "Get in!" *She groaned and ran around the shelving, jumping on top of the couch.* "Continue!"

Michael: "R-Right." *He nervously coughed, looking back to the camera.* "By spreading word, you could help not only share an amazing tale, but perhaps even spread some of the morals learnt in the book-"

Chrisma: "Yeah, so like, rate the book! Review the book! Love the books!"

Michael: "Umm, what I think Chrisma means, is that every rating and review helps-"

Chrisma: "Tell your friends and family! Go on the internet or whatever!"

Michael: "C-Chrisma, you shouldn't demand-"

Chrisma: "You know people with connections?! I wanna see me in a damn movie!"

Michael: "Chrisma-"

Chrisma: "For research!" *She fist punched the air above her.*

Michael: *He sighed, awkwardly nodding his head.* "Well, I guess Chrisma has the right mind frame?"

Lupton: "Wat's happening?" *He grunted, casually walking into the shot.*

Michael: "I was-"

Chrisma: "We're telling the readers not to be stupid and give our story ratings."

Lupton: "Oh?"

Chrisma: "If it sells well, it could become a movie!"

Michael: "Or an audiobook-"

Chrisma and Lupton: "Lame."

Michael: "What about an RPG game?"

Chrisma: "Get in!"
Lupton: "Now you're talking!"

Michael: *He nodded his head with a smirk.* "I was thinking, Tales of Rostical?"

Chrisma and Lupton: "I like it!"

Michael: "Haha. I'd want the option of multiple people playing in a battle."

Chrisma: *She eagerly nodded her head, groaning at the camera.* "It gets lonely playing an RPG all by yourself."

Michael: "It'd have miss-able sidequests, new game plus, skits-"

Lupton: "Wait? This is a seven book series, this game would be huge?!"

Michael: "Exactly! If done right, it could possibly be the best RPG of the year?!"

Lupton: "Please! Best RPG on whatever console's generation."

Michael: "Anyway-" *He looked at the camera, causing Chrisma and Lupton to nod their heads in understanding.*

Chrisma, Lupton and Michael: "Thank you very much for reading The Rostical Users!"

Chapter 010: RPG Taunts

Hello, during my time writing and editing, I often heard our heroes shouting out generic battle cries during their fights with Scoldrants, warriors etc. So, I posted some of them down, but I admit, I could have put a lot more work into it, but still. Hope you enjoy them :).

Chapter 011: Manga

Good evening. If you don't already know, The Rostical Users has an ongoing manga! Yes, you should check it out! My dream is to see our adventure as an anime or movie. One day, someone will come along and notice how amazing this adventure is! :').
Anyway, here is a page from the manga, it's where Millard saves Alicia, Lance and Ashton from the spider Scoldrant back in chapter two.



Chapter 28: Epilogue

Ashton: *He slowly took his hand off the ruby and silently stood up before taking several steps back.* "W-What was that?"

Dad: *He smiled.* "Did you like it?"

Ashton: "Was that AR? Was that real?"

?????: "Hoh?" *A woman stepped out of a swirl of aurora coloured lights and stared at Ashton's back.*

Ashton: *He turned around and pointed at the woman with a gasp.* "It's that chick!"

Dad: "H-How?!"
Beautiful Mother: "Teresa?!" *They gasped at the same time.*

Teresa: "It is a pleasure to finally see you again, Alicia, Lance." *She spoke with a smile while retaining a professional stature.*

Ashton: *He looked at his parents with widening eyes.* "How'd she get in the house?! The door's locked, right?!"

Alicia: *She ran across the room and slightly jumped up, tightly giving Teresa a hug.* "It's been so long!"

Teresa: "Indeed."

Lance: *He chuckled and walked up to Teresa, giving her a welcoming hug.* "How are you here?"

Teresa: "It appears I have reached new milestones with Aurorions in your absence."

Alicia: *She touched Teresa's face.* "You don't look a day older than I remember."

Teresa: "I have physically aged roughly two days, so your observation is incorrect-"

Lance: "Ah, don't be a shit nugget."

Ashton: "What the fuck is happening-?"

Lance: "Oi!"
Alicia: "Language!" *They shouted at the same time, causing Ashton to look down.*

Ashton: "I'm sorry. I'm just-"

Teresa: "Hoh?" *She took a step forward, observing Ashton's facial features.* "It appears you have produced an offspring."

Lance: "Yea, people in love tend to do that."

Ashton: *He shook his head with complete confusion.* "W-Who are you?"

Teresa: "Is it wrong to assume that you have viewed the Crystalline Membrane Pepper created?"

Ashton: (There's no way in hell this is happening. Was it the pre-workout mix?) *He touched the side of his head in confusion.*

Lance: "How did you know?"

Teresa: "Biologically, he has aged roughly twenty-one years. Perhaps his dormant Neurons are mutating-"

Alicia: "Mutating?"

Teresa: "Indeed. The same way DNA mutates as we age-" *She pointed to the ruby on the table.* "Perhaps the Rosterology artefact responded to its mutation? Nevertheless, it was designed to work without Neurons."

Alicia: "W-What brings you here?" *She bit her bottom lip with watering eyes.* "Excuse my manners, would you like some tea? Lance, do we still have some leftover dinner?"

Lance: "Yea." *He enthusiastically nodded his head as if he was overcome with emotions.*

Teresa: "I do not believe I will be here for long."

Lance: "Oh.."
Alicia: "I-I see.." *They sounded disappointed.*

Teresa: "Perhaps the three of you would like to join me for the consumption of calories at Surpreon?"

Ashton: "Surpreon, Season's city?" *He whispered to himself as if he was recollecting the scenes from the ruby.*

Teresa: "Negative. It is Tyler's city."

Ashton: "Oh, yeah?"

Lance: "The three of us?"

Teresa: "Did I stutter?"

Ashton: "Ahaha!" *He chuckled in disbelief.* "She acts, sounds and looks the same! Did you two hire actors that look like younger versions of yourselves, or what?"

Teresa: *She ignored Ashton.* "Amy, Luna and Tyler have been planning for this specific occasion for a significant amount of time-"

Lance: "But I can't.."

Teresa: *She tilted her head to one side.* "Please elaborate?"

Alicia: "He lost his powers, remember?"

Teresa: "Dawn has hypothesised that all these years has exhausted your Neuron and Astragon count to the same levels before you were all originally transported."

Lance: "OK, I've become more smarter, but I'm still a little lost."

Teresa: "It is possible that you will regain your lost abilities, have the same phenomenon as Tyler, or it will simply reject you."

Alicia: "A-And me?"

Teresa: "I do not see why Radiatons will not fill back into your body."

Lance: "W-We could go back?" *He sounded surprised, excited and scared.*

Teresa: "Tcch, such a mixture of emotions. Yes."

Alicia: "What if something happens to either of my boys?"

Teresa: *She smiled.* "Then it is fortunate the master of Aurorions is able to send you back to this realm the moment disorientation affects your cognitive abilities."

Ashton: "Go to your world? But, it's artificial reality?"

Teresa: *She waved to the side, causing a portal-like swirl of aurora lights to appear behind her.* "Do you not desire to see your old comrades?"

Lance: *His eyes watered and he looked back to Ashton.* "Wanna see the world for yourself?"

Alicia: "What about the house? Our jobs? Our-"

Lance: "We retired years ago. We're just working for the sake of working." *He spoke with an emotional smile.* "Who knows how long we will be."

Teresa: "What is your decision-?"

Alicia: "Tee hee!" *She excitedly skipped past Teresa and stepped into the portal, causing her image to warp and fade.* "Don't forget Kairi and Leon!"

Lance: *He listened to Alicia's echoing voice fade in the distance.* "Ash, could you please get your grandparents?"

Ashton: "Ah, yeah, sure." *He nodded his head and quickly jogged towards the cabinet that housed the ruby and gently grabbed two vases.*

Teresa: "Hoh?"

Lance: "I feel it's only appropriate to spread their ashes where they were born."

Ashton: "My grandparents were really from another world? Does that make me an alien?!" *He squealed in disbelief.*

Lance: "Let's go, Ash." *He grunted and looked over his shoulder, watching Ashton walk towards him with the vases in one hand.*

Ashton: "S-Sure." *He nervously shuffled his feet towards Teresa.*

Lance: (I'm a little nervous something bad will happen to me.)

Alicia: "L-Lance? Are you okay?"
Lance: "Y-Yea-"
Alicia: "You're pale, sweating and-"
Lance: "Actually, no, I'm not OK-" *Their conversation echoed in Lance's head.*

Lance: (I don't want to ever feel like that again..)

Ashton: *He subconsciously grabbed Lance's hand as if instinct took over.* "Will it hurt?"

Teresa: "The only thing that is hurting is the time wasted watching the two of you enter an energy-consuming teleportation-"

Lance: "OK, we get it."

Teresa: *She nodded her head as Lance and Ashton stopped in front of the portal.* "Also, may I state that I have reason to doubt that you have increased in intelligence."

Ashton: "Ahaha-"

Lance: "Here I go, butt nugget." *He playfully punched Ashton and took a step forward, watching the area swirl and blur around him.*

Ashton: "Dad, for the last time, stop calling me that!" *He nervously took a step forward, watching the area blur and swirl around him.*

Teresa: *She smiled as Lance and Ashton disappeared in flashes of aurora light, prompting her to walk towards it.* "This reunion is really pleasant.. I wonder if they will start a new adventure with their son in our world?"

*Teresa stepped into the portal, disappearing in a flash of purple light.*

###

Lezard: "Well, after ten years of writing and over a million words, Lezard is saddened but happy to announce the closure of their adventure." *He waved his hands in front of his face as he attempted not to cry.*

Michael: "Teresa having the ability to control the Aurorions, maybe the Lightens will take frequent trips to the world of Rostical? Maybe they will stay? Whatever they decide, I'm sure they will live happily ever after! They certainly deserve it!"

Lezard: "Thank you for reading! If you liked the adventure! Please send your support with a review to support the author's life work! You are amazing, don't let anyone lower your morale and let Lezard know if you were able to learn or relate to anything! For instance, who was able to relate to Lezard's humour? Lezard wants to know your favourite ships? What your favourite Remenistal was-?"

Michael: "Okay, you're rambling on, Lezard!"

Lezard: "Well, you're not a great writer but Lezard would be lying if he said it wasn't good."

Michael: "If you haven't read The Rostical Guild series, please check it out and tell me what you think!"

Lezard: "The guild is better."

Michael: "Bias aside, I personally would like to thank you for reaching this far! And those that have supported me in these past ten years, you rock! Thank you."
