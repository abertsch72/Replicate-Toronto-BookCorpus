Tower of Gates Fantasy RPG Guide Book 1
AUTHOR NOTE:



This book was created with the assistance of GPT-3 API, an AI language model from OpenAI that I got access to this summer.

I wrote tens of thousands of unique words to train GPT-3 to output character backstories - and more.
I then used the tools I created to generate hundreds of examples. After editing them (and adding some easter eggs), I compiled them together in this collection.
You can try the tools out for yourself at the LitRPG Adventures Workshop. Currently, there are fourteen RPG generators working.

He took the opportunity and started a business, buying and selling exotic things from across the world. He’s looking for his next big score to get him started on the next adventure.

Personality:

When he returned, he taught Vassago about the arcane arts and how to wield a sword. Vassago never had a strong bond with his father, though. His father was a famous warrior in his homeland, but Vassago would rather cast spells than swing a sword.

He is a far more powerful wizard than he is a fighter.

Personality:

Vassago is too focused on his studies to worry much about his social life. He finds himself distracted by mathematics and the arcane arts. He often has trouble relating to others, but he finds it easy to relate to animals, particularly birds.

staff that he enchanted to look intimidating. He has a ring that his father gave him that has a ruby in it. He wears it on his right hand, a place of pride among elven mages.

At the age of 15, however, his father was poisoned by a rival family. With the palace burning behind them, Nox and his brother fled into the city.

These orbs or spheres can detonate on impact, dealing 1d6 points of energy damage per spell level (maximum 10d6).

Esmerelda

Female Dark Elf Warlock

Born in The City of Zitham

Backstory:

Esmerelda was born into the upper class of the City of Zitham. Her father is a wealthy merchant and her mother is a socialite. The only thing Esmerelda cared about growing up — and still cares about today — is magic. She has an innate ability for the arcane arts and is always looking to advance her skills. Her father wants her to settle down, get married, and have children. She considers it, but there’s too much in the world for her to see and learn, and she looks for a husband that will share her interests. So far, that hasn’t happened. Esmerelda’s adventures throughout Grabisco have revealed many opportunities that have the potential to help her advance her skills. She wants to start a school of magic once she has achieved the level of wizard.

Personality:

Esmerelda is a confident young woman. She and her best friend, Wrenne, are a bit snarky, and Esmerelda is quick to tease her. When it comes to her craft, she is a perfectionist and is a little hard on herself when she can’t figure things out. When she’s upset, she bottles things up, which drives Wrenne crazy.

Appearance:
Esmerelda grows her hair long and usually has it beaded or tied up in a loose bun. Her eyes are bright green and her skin is a deep olive color. She usually wears a simple robe cinched at the waist with a thin belt, and a dark blue dress underneath. She is never without a wand — usually a wooden one. Her school-issued wand is made of silver and was her father’s.

an appropriate Craft or Knowledge (nature) check, depending on the source of the water. You may only purify water in this way once per day.

2.Healing Draught - At 8th level, you can create a healing draught that restores hit points equal to 1d8 + your caster level (maximum +10) when imbibed. A creature can benefit from the healing draught only once per day. You can create a number of potions equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) each day.

If you have the Brew Potion feat, you gain a +2 bonus on the Craft (alchemy) check to create potions.

Appearance:

Xardasar has short white hair with a faint blue hue. His fair skin is riddled with piercings; his ears, eyebrows, nose, and a stud on his lower lip. He dresses in a long black robe with the lower half of his face covered by a silver mask, reminiscent of the old order of monks who prided themselves on their ability to hide their identity.

Iphigenia Underbarrel

Female Dark Elf Warlock

Born in The City of Ledale

Her mother was later disposed and Iphigenia left an orphan. She was found by one of the city’s wealthiest merchants who took her in. The merchant was pleased to have a daughter to marry off into a good family, but Iphigenia had other plans. She ran off after school, intent on striking out on her own. She decided she would seek revenge for the death of her father and mother. She wants to make sure that no one else will have to endure this fate.

Personality:
Iphigenia is aggressive and confrontational, even more so than the typical dark elf. She is very loyal to her friends and will fight to protect them. She’s also very sure of herself, often never doubting her decisions or her abilities. Virgil and Iphigenia have been great friends for years.

Appearance:

Iphigenia is tall and lean, with a face dominated by a large hooked nose. Her skin is dark and she has jet black hair. Her breasts are large, but lack any sagging. She always wears a small leather cap on her head and keeps a longbow and 15 arrows on her back.

Iago Greenhollow

Male Dark Elf Enchanter

Born in The Home of Garaak, the Dark Elf High Priest of Ina.

Backstory:

Iago was born into a life that most Dark Elves would never know the likes of. His father was a cleric of Ina, one of the goddesses of the Dark Elves, and his mother was a midwife of the tribe who delivered children within a day’s ride of the cluster of families who lived in the swamp.

While Iago had a good childhood, he yearned for the opportunities his father had. He wanted to learn the ancient ways of magic and study the written word. So, when he turned 16, Iago walked to the city of Runn for that purpose.

Runn was a place of intrigue, and Iago was intrigued by it. He made his way to the library of the Mystics, where he talked himself in as a researcher. The keeper of the library took an interest in Iago, and she taught him all the ways to reading, writing, and the arcane ways of the enchanter.

In addition, this keeper, Ronda, tutored him in the ways of the hermetic arts. Iago learned everything that he could, but he knew he would have to put what he knew to the test if he wanted to make his name known. Thus, he set out for the Legends of Grabisco buying spells and training himself in the ways of the mystic.

For Levels: 1 - 44

Rarity: Rare

Special Abilities:

(Hail) (Snow) (Rain) (Weather)

At first, Pecan was a bit hesitant to do this, as she didn't want everyone to think that she was only good for making snow, but as time passed, Pecan grew to like the idea, and decided to make snow when travelers would ask her to.

But when Pecan made snow for other people, she would always tell them that it was a real storm, not just snow. Over time, Pecan was able to take the snow out of a single flask or bottle, and spread it to cover a good portion of the earth. Over time, Pecan began to consider herself a snow goddess, and people began to call her the Fountain of Snow, and that was pretty much what she was.

When Pecan became a snow goddess, she made a vast number of snowmen and snow women who worked for her, and they traveled around for many years making snow for people. As the years passed, Pecan slowly became more and more tired of making snow for people, and was yearning for something different in her life.

Potion Recipe:

Wart's Potion of Healing

Created by Wart - Artist Unknown

Item Type: Potion

For Levels: 1 - 101

Rarity: Rare
Special Abilities:

(Heal) (Chaos Magic)

Description:

This potion is a strange, dark-green color, and smells horrible. Apparently, it is a result of trouble-shooting on the alchemical plane, and it has no known weaknesses or strengths. This potion is a wonderous thing, for it can be drunk to heal the drinker.

The amount of healing it does is determined by level, but it is still weak in comparison to a high-level healer. It can also be drunk as a normal potion, and then a level 2-20 wizard can drink it to gain one spell point.

History:

Wart was one of the most famous Thieves of the Thieves Guild, and helped the guild pull off many heists. He was also nicknamed the King of Thieves, because of his high-profile heists.

Parson's Potion of Illusion

Created by Parson The Great
Item Type: Potion

For Levels: 1 - 30

Rarity: Uncommon

Special Abilities:

(Illusion)

Description:

This potion is pink in color and smells like horse manure. If one drinks this potion, they will be able to hear what is really going on, even if it's not the truth, for a short period of time. This usually does not cause too many problems, as it's not hard to pick out the lies from the liars. This potion is made from the perfumes used to mask the smell of horse manure.

History:

Parson the Great was a highly educated man, and he was also a wizard of great power. Because of this, he was never taken in by lies, and also because of this, he was said to have had a very long life. The reason the effects of the potion seem to wear off quickly is that Parson the Great had to drink this potion quite frequently to remain ahead of the game. Some of the things that Parson the Great did were the capture of a great sea serpent, the creation of a moveable city, the draining of a lake, and the creation of a way to freeze time.

One day, a thief broke into her house and tried to steal her father’s coin purse. Rylie’s father taught her how to defend herself and she did so to the best of her ability.

outskirts of town. Her parents were mostly absent for her first few years of life, and her upbringing was mostly left to her tutors.

In her free time, she tried to find companionship with the children who lived in the poorer parts of town. Initially, she was called out as being ugly and strange, but that changed when she revealed her power. Her parents arranged for her to learn magic with the school master.

The school master thought that it was important for her to have some of the finer things in life, such as proper clothing and a comfortable home.

He sought to combine the two in order to gain the power of two elements.

The wizard discovered that his power was still not enough to make it happen. It was the balance between the two that he could not find. The wizard created another staff that held the element of both Fire and Ice. He then used his skills to make his staff balance the two.

Ebon

Male High Elf Warlock

Born in The City of Ledale

Over the years, Ebon grew to envy the evil elf, telling Ebon that he had a great destiny to fulfill. Ebon felt that he must do whatever the wizard wished to prove himself worthy of being his apprentice.

After many years, Ebon became the most powerful warlock in the world. The wizard showed little interest in Ebon’s achievements, however, as he was more interested in summoning fiends to do his bidding for him. Ebon was left to wander the world as he chose.

He returns to the wizard for tempering every now and again.

Item Type: Potion

For Levels: 1 - 5

(Grow) (Big)

Description:

Oghur always had a tin can in his hand, in which he used as a snack bowl. He liked to eat anything and everything, and the only thing that he didn't care for was bananas. Oghur was also a bit of a jokester, at one point throwing the potion of growth on his teacher. This could explain why he was not well liked by the teacher, as there were many injuries that were sustained due to the fact that he grew so fast.

Still, he was a great hero who had an amazing sense of humor, one which is still remembered to this day.

We know that a woman named Sjofn the Maid wrote the book of many things. We also know that she was a good person, who then was corrupted by the forces of evil.

It reads: "This is my book of many things. But I am not the one who wrote it. You must find the evil Sjofn the Maid, and if you can, destroy her." Maybe Sjofn wasn't so good after all...

the entire world and spread the word about her beliefs.

Editor’s Note:

Tassia, while goodhearted, wasn’t too bright. A Male Halfling Illusionist Vampire by the name of Epiphany Eppenheimer tricked her into casting the spell once, and the IAO has plagued the Material Plane ever since. Quite a few people are angry with Tassia as a result. Epiphany had woken up with a hangover and used a powerful illusion to get her to cast the spell and endanger the entire world of Zaidan - and maybe a few other dimensions as well. A brief story of Epiphany Eppenheimer follows.

Epiphany Eppenheimer

Male Halfling Illusionist (Vampire)

DEATHSTORY: When Epiphany was a fighter in Grabisco, he hated the fact that he could never get a good workout. He would do a lot of training, and not improve very much. This is the same reason he only spent time with the most powerful, most rich, and most influential people in society. He
always believed that working on his physical strength and building it up was the key to improving his fighting ability and skill.

In fact, he believed that if he had better physical strength, his intellect and capabilities would be amplified. In his personal life, he was never happy with his lack of ability to improve his strength. He continued to do his best to build his strength because he was determined to become the most awesome fighter the world had ever seen. He was a good friend, always willing to help people in need and offer them advice.

He had very few enemies, although one notable foe was an army leader named Ferro, who was also a werewolf. After his friend’s death, Epiphany hunted down Ferro and made the werewolf pay for his crimes. Unfortunately, after this was done, Epiphany became very depressed and sad. Depressed and sad for a few months, he finally decided he needed new challenges in a new land. He then dreamt of the world of Zaidan, and decided that he would go there in order to seek his new adventures.

He dreamed of a time where he could become stronger and more powerful and carry out his greatest plan, which in his dreams, would be fulfilled. Epiphany arrived in Zaidan, had all of his belongings transported there as well, and then set out on foot to see the land. He had already learned there was a place called the Dark Lands in this world, and he wanted to explore that region and maybe meet others who were also in search of glory and adventure.

If nothing else, he was looking forward to meeting the ghosts that inhabited this land. During this period, he met Tassia Belcoot and used a powerful illusion to get her to cast the somewhat cursed enchantment spell that has her hated in nearly half the known world. Epiphany is not a nice halfling when he misses too many second breakfasts.

History

The city was built by a king named Peric. Peric decided to build the city to honor the builder of the ancient ruins on which it was built. He built the city directly on top of the ancient ruin, and he gave the city a magical feel to it. The old city was enchanted by the king, and was given the ability to restore the dead to life. This led to the city becoming a center of learning for mages and clerics all over the world. Now, the city is known as a place of study and learning, and has become a center of knowledge for the world.

Nograk

Town - (Ancient) (Fortified) (Walls) (Mountains) (Magical) (Hidden)

Description

The town of Nograk is on the eastern side of the Callarri Mountains. It is heavily fortified, and has been in a constant state of war for over 1000 years. The town has no walls, instead, it has a large inner ring of mountains with a small valley in the center.

The valley contains the town itself, as well as the homes of the local nobles. The outer ring of mountains is filled with the rest of the population of the town. The villagers live in makeshift huts. The huts are small, and are not protected from the harsh cold of winter.
The huts are built close together, and a majority of the town's population lives in the outer ring. The inner ring is home to the local nobles, and there are only a handful of families that live there. The center of the valley contains a castle where the current lord of the land lives.

The valley is bright and sunny most of the time, but in the winter, it is very cold, and in the summer, it is very hot and dry. The town has many farms that grow the food for the local villagers, and a few of the nobles that live in the outer ring.

The town sits on a large gold mine that has provided the town with a steady income, and the town's defenses have never been breached.

The town of Nograk is the smallest inhabited town in Callarri, but it is also the most affluent.

Batsraan

Megalopolis - (Ancient) (New Construction) (Elven) (Elven Population)

(Dwarven) (Dwarven Population) (Human) (Human Population) (Halfling)
(Halflings) (Halfling Population) (Fortified) (Magical) (Good)

Description

Batsraan is a large city of many different races, located in the nation of Trogrud. The city is situated on a single large island, surrounded by a variety of smaller islands. The city is built into the side of a mountain that is nestled between the two smaller mountain ranges.

Heavily fortified with large walls and many towers, the city has entrances to it that are not accessible from the city itself, but from the smaller islands surrounding the city. The city is well known for its many forges and smelters, mining the soil for large quantities of iron and other metals.

The halflings are the most common race in the city, but are not the majority in power. (Editor’s Sub-Note: That itself is worthy an entire novel. Leave a comment it you agree.)
The city is extremely well protected, with guards patrolling the streets and standing watch on buildings.

History

Batsraan was established by the dwarves and elves, but the dwarves made up a majority of the population. The dwarves worked hard to build their city, bringing in resources and building the walls and towers. A large wall separated the city from the rest of the island, and the only way to access the city is through a massive gate that the dwarves built themselves.

Eben Zooglepitch

Male Dwarf Sorcerer

Born in The Kingdom of Kragmaar

Backstory:

Eben lived in the foothills of the Iron Mountains with his family. As a child, he was fascinated by the forces of magic, watching as the mountain dwarves used it to forge their mighty weapons and tools. He spent his days sneaking into the workshops of the dwarves, taking notes on the enchantments that brought light to their eyes.

He always knew he wanted to learn magic. After Eben graduated from school with the best grades in his class, his greatest challenge lay ahead of him: passing the Test of the Witch. So intent on passing the test, Eben studied for months, poring over books dedicated to the dark arts.

When the day of the test arrived, Eben failed. His tutor said it was because he was too smart for his own good. He was rejected from the Guild of Enchanters and was forced to return to his family’s farm in the foothills of Kragmaar.

One night, when his family was out enjoying the local witch’s pub, Eben snuck inside their wagon to look at their spellbooks, hoping to learn something that would allow him to pass the Test of the Witch. But he got too excited and was caught by his parents when they returned.

Eben went running into the woods and hid for months, eventually stumbling upon an old and forgotten cave. He discovered spirits there that taught him how to use magic the way he had always wanted. He realized that he had to
learn more and vowed to find out all of the secrets of magic, even if it meant going against the rules of the Enchanters Guild.

Personality:

Eben is quite serious when it comes to magic. He’s very polite, but he prefers to be alone.

Appearance:

Eben has blond hair with light blue eyes. His skin is pale from spending so much time inside. He wears some of his family’s old clothing. He requires spectacles to see clearly.

Larkin Hufferhassle

Female Dwarf Sorcerer

Backstory:

Larkin was born, as dwarves are, in the middle of a war. Her father, a wizard named Vozbrigg, was a powerful member of the Great Council of Wizards. She grew up in the Hufferhassle family manor, training with her father to become a powerful wizard like him. She was taken on a quest when she was young, to protect a group of clerics from local monsters. They took her in as part of their group, and she learned how to cast arcane magic from them. She also met her spirit animal, a cat named Gemma.

Personality:

She’s a bit more serious than most dwarves her age. She’s often seen frowning. She rarely talks, but when she does, people listen to her. She’s very good at the complex, esoteric magic taught to her by her father. She’s very loyal to her friends.

She’s looking for an adventure to rid the kingdom of her father’s old nemesis Zan.

Editor’s Note:

Zan the Wizard is rumored by some to be similar to a certain pirate in the Princess Bride, but this has been proven not to be true. My brother’s friend has a sister who read a book online that spells out the truth on this matter. Yes, she is a Zannite Cultist, but that is besides the point!

For Levels: 1 - 5

Rarity: Common

Special Abilities:

(Transmute) (Zan) (Zan the Wizard) (Zanite Cult) (Fog) (Arcane) (Random)

(Polymorph)

Description:

This potion has a red liquid inside of it, with a white inactive substance at the top of it. It was described as smelling a bit like rotten eggs, and accounts of what it changes people into are actually terrifying. This is a very rare potion, and it also has a very short shelf life. It must be made fresh each time it's to be used, and a few drops of it must be mixed into a gallon of water, and then let sit for a couple of days before being used.

There are those who have said that the potion was actually created by a powerful mage, and that the owner of it will change into creatures of the netherworld. Another story says that the original inventor of this potion
became trapped in a cave in as a result of his invention, with one old story claiming that this inventor was trapped in a cave for a long time, and that he was there for months and even years before he was finally able to escape. It is said that after he escaped he vowed never to use this potion again.

History:

"The moon's my constant companion. I'll never get bored. The moon is rather good company." Achan the Sunderer is arguably the most notorious monomaniac in the world by the time of the War of the Ring, having haunted the entire Western Coast of Daventry. Even if he uses the potion in battle sometimes, it doesn't have much effect, but when he uses it while he's in the middle of a conversation with someone, it can be frightening. Achan is a man who is filled with questions, and one of them is, "What am I?" In the end, it seems, he found the answer.

Editor’s Note:

The potion mentioned above was found on the following quest in the Kingdom of Grabisco on the planet Zaidan.

them to aid the old wizard. Fozum has the ability to open a gateway to another dimension. He needs to summon a powerful demon to power this spell, but an evil god named Zan has sent one of its minions to stop it. Zan's minion is a powerful wizard named Zan who has already killed Fozum's assistant (the gnome Wilson). Fozum wants the party to stop Zan from attacking him again. This request will lead the party to a battle with the Zanite Cult, as well as Zan the Wizard. Zan the Wizard is the most powerful member of the Zanite Cult. He is an evil wizard who has the power to open a portal to the dimension Fozum needs so he can perform his spell. Zan the Wizard is very aware of his power, and he will use it to his advantage.

Staff of Exhaustion

Created by X the Sorcerer

Item Type: Necklace

For Levels: 4 - 30 Rarity: Uncommon

Special Abilities:

(Restore Mana) (Zan) (Zan the Wizard) (Zanite Cult) (Arcane)
Description:

This item looks like a huge nugget of quartz with a pointy tip. It is about half a foot long and weighs about 10 pounds. It is made of hard crystal with some streaks of an unknown, but dark, metal. The staff feels light in the hand, despite its weight.

History:

The Staff of Exhaustion was created by Zan to help restore his aging body. The staff was originally a small, normal looking crystal that was hidden in a chest in the bottom level of Zan's Tower. It was a minor artifact that was created during the time of the Wars of Creation.

Near the end of the wars, the Staff of Exhaustion was created. It took the lives of many Sorcerers during the Wars of Creation and still retains a major amount of energy. Zan was certain that he would be able to control its power if he was able to acquire it.

Zan traveled to the tower that concealed this staff and traveled deep into the tower where the small crystal was placed in the chest. Zan was unaware that the crystal was in fact the Staff and the chest was disguised to look like a coffin.

Zan did not stop to study the chest before he opened it. This would prove to be his final mistake. As the coffin opened and Zan saw the small crystal, the crystal released a tremendous blast of negative energy and energy that crumbled Zan to nothingness.

The Staff was then the property of the Wizard. The Staff now contains small amounts of Zan's soul. Currently, the Staff of Exhaustion finds itself in the hands of an Elven Sorcerer that calls himself Zan. The Sorcerer soon came to the realization that the staff was not just a mystical artifact, but was in fact a part of Zan's soul.

Soon after his revelation, he came to realize that the staff was tainted with the evilness of the Dark One. He then sought out the aid of another Sorcerer named Zan in an attempt to rid the staff of the evil that it held.

Qalet

Male Dwarf Illusionist

Born in The Town of Gostrea

Backstory:

Qalet’s father was a goldsmith who ran his business out of their home. His mother was a dwarf wizard. His parents were killed by the orc raiders when he was just a child. He was found in the rubble by a ranger who took him in and raised him as his own.

Qalet had an interest in magic, but preferred to focus on deception, disguise, and illusion. The priestess of Zorru who ran the orphanage where he lived taught him the ways of the divine. His thirst for knowledge grew and he started studying under the head priestess of Zorru.

The priests wanted him to stay, but curiosity about the outside world got the better of him.

Magic Item:

Zan the Wizard's Spellbook

Created by J.P. Tortkien

Item Type: Spellbook

For Levels: 1 - 5 Rarity: Epic

Special Abilities:

(Illusion) (Zan) (Zan the Wizard) (Zanite Cult)

Description:

Weighing in at three pounds, this book is covered in a thick leather material. The first thing that is noticed about the book is that it has a strange, but familiar, smell. It is a mixture of dust and vanilla. The cover is made of a soft, rubbery material. The book has a latch on the side. It can be securely fastened with a small loop of leather.

The book has so many pages that it is difficult to count them all. The pages are made of thick parchment paper, which is common for books that were created centuries ago. There are multiple inked scrawlings on the pages as to the spells he knew.

The spells are carefully arranged according to the level of the caster. The spells seem to somehow link the mage to the spell, so that the spell will be uncastable by anyone else. There are many notes on the spells and how they are cast. There are also explanations on how a spell can be improved, or items can be invented to use with the spell.
There seem to be many of these in the book, which is unusual, as most mages don't go to this much trouble.

History:

Zan is an old magician who has cast many spells and made many inventions. Inventors tend to think of different ways of using their inventions, and Zan is not exempted from this. Zan and his apprentice, Matlas, both came up with a way to combine spells.

One would write their spell down and the other would write down their modification to the spell. They then would build a special item to combine the two spells, so that when the wearer of the item casts the spell, the spells would both work.

The wearer would have no idea that he was wearing the item and the spells would still work. Zan could cast many spells himself, but he preferred to use his special items.

Editor’s Note:

This spellbook was likely a forgery by Zarn the Mad, a mage who was very jealous of Zan the Wizard and his ultimate power.

Dune Windor is a city that was originally made by the dwarves that inhabit the Skylan Mountains. It was rebuilt by the humans around 2,000 years ago. The city is high in the sky away from the rest of the world, and is made in a circle around a giant tower that acts as it's windmill. The city is known for it's food and gold production.

History

The city of Dune Windor was originally built by the dwarves of the Skylan Mountains. They were isolated from most of the countries of their time. They could not travel out of the mountains due to the size and the difficulty of getting down to the base of the mountain.

It was not until a group of humans decided to explore the mountains that they were discovered. The humans, hearing of their location, decided to
travel up into the mountains. However, the climb up the mountain had long been abandoned due to the difficulty and danger.

The humans, despite this, decided to continue to the mountains and began their journey up the mountain. The trip took many months, and cost the lives of many of the explorers. When they finally arrived at the summit, they saw the dwarves.

The dwarves quickly greeted them and began trading. The dwarves taught the humans how to raise certain crops, and the humans taught the dwarves how to forge metals. The city grew into a very large city, and was one of the most populated cities at that time.

However, due to the distance between them and their other human neighbors, they began to isolate themselves from the rest of humanity. This began to dwindle their population, but they managed to keep their population up due to the trading they established.

Eventually, the humans sought out to conquer the rest of the world. The dwarves did not like this, so they decided to seal off their mountain passageway. They allowed the humans to leave, but did not allow them to return.

This was 2,000 years ago, and the humans have since forgotten about the dwarves that live within the mountains.

Niva

Female Half-Orc Warlock

Born in The Town of Catamor

Backstory:

Niva was taken in by an old woman after her parents were killed by goblins. The old woman wanted a companion. Niva’s stubbornness and fiery attitude were enough to annoy a goddess. So, the woman grew to like her and felt that Niva was a blessing.

As Niva grew older, she was attracted to all the wrong things. She wanted to be a bard, but she was a horrible singer. She wanted to be an archer, but she couldn’t hit the target. She wanted to be a priest of the goddess Ishtar, but she was cruel and showed no compassion.

She turned to the dark arts of necromancy and gained the powers of a warlock. Over time, Niva realized that she did have talent. Her cruelty grew,
and no one was safe from her wrath. Niva has decided to defeat the necromancers of Zane, to show them what true power is.

Mailskulls

Male Half-Orc Warlock

Born in The City of Hroftesbury
Backstory:

The son of a wealthy merchant, Mailskulls was well fed and well educated. He learned the trade of the merchant, and he learned the trade of the wares-man as well. He was good at both, but he wanted more. He wanted to find adventure of his own. He wanted to go far away and see all the lands nearby, but mostly he wanted power and wealth.

He would search for it all his life, and he would find it. In a dream, he was visited by a demon of the Abyss. The demon offered to grant him power and he accepted. The demon bound his soul to Mailskulls and he was given the powers of a Warlock.

Since, he has spent most of his time in the service of the demon. He has travelled the known world and plundered its ruins. He has battled and slain many powerful dragons. He has gathered riches beyond all reckoning. He has, in short, become the most powerful Warlock in the world.

Personality:

Mailskulls is a greedy, egotistic and self-indulgent man. He expects others to fawn over him and act as his servants. He is quick to anger and slow to forgive.

Appearance:

At first glance, he seems to be a handsome man in his mid-thirties. On closer inspection, you notice the red scabs on his face and hands, and the sense of evil radiating from him in waves.

Start of Character:

Having travelled the world, Mailskulls is now looking for more powerful weapons and an even higher degree of immortality.

Warlock Patron:

Eblis the Malison

He wears a ring that depicts a fire giant, the symbol of his power among his tribe. Eblis’s eyes are the most disturbing, though. They always seem to peer right through you.

Description

You have made a pact with an immortal creature that holds dominion over one of the outer planes. It might be a demigod, or one of the Archdevils of Hell, a powerful elemental prince, or one of the ancient ones. Once you have satisfied the conditions of your pact, your patron will give you a mark, which might appear in a visible location or invisibly on your body. The mark is a symbol of your allegiance to the fiendish power and attunes you to its realm.

+1), these effects stack. You can be targeted by a dispel magic just as if you had cast a spell, but your total bonus on attack and damage rolls from all of your spellcasting and special abilities is not affected.

Magic Item:
Wand of the Storm

Created by Graftil the Half-Elf

Item Type: Wand

For Levels: 1 - 30

Rarity: Uncommon

Special Abilities:

(Electrical Damage)

Description:

This is a simple oak wood wand with a shaft of ivory. No decorative objects or metal are anywhere on this wand. There is only one crack in the wand and a tiny rivulet of blood runs down the center of the ivory shaft. It looks very old and probably wouldn’t fetch more than five coins on the open market. The wand has thirty charges.

History:

The wand belonged to a half-elf wizard named Graftil. He was a very powerful mage who made his home in the forest north of the city of Hillsfar. This wand was the last item he used in battle. He was fighting a red dragon that was terrorizing a farming village near the forest.

The red dragon was too powerful for Graftil to fight, so he conjured this wand and cast a lightning bolt, hoping to weaken the dragon enough for him to make an escape. When the lightning bolt hit the dragon’s scales, it recoiled, but it had only slowed it down.

The dragon dove at Graftil, and Graftil, already knowing he was going to die, teleported away. The dragon breathed fire and reduced Graftil’s home to rubble. The dragon crushed the wand under it’s massive feet and didn’t notice as the wand broke in two.
The charge in the wand was drained, so the half-elf wizard was never heard from again. It was said that he was surely killed by the dragon.

The wand survives, however, and has been copied numerous times.

Potion Recipe:

Pertinax's Potion of Chaos Defense

Created by Pertinax the Supreme

Item Type: Potion

For Levels: 4 - 5

Rarity: Rare

Special Abilities:

(Armor) (Chaos Magic)

Description:

This potion is clear in color and is very thick. Every time it is made, it tastes differently. Those who consume this potion will immediately be engulfed in a violent storm of chaos magic as their armor shimmers and almost splits open. While the potion is in affect, the wielder's armor is no longer affected by any other armor, and will not be altered by any other armor-affecting magic, but will still receive the penalties and bonuses provided by the original armor.
The wearer's armor skill will also be affected, becoming stronger when the wielder has a higher experience level, but weaker when the wielder is very new. The effect of this potion wears off after 5 minutes. This potion is very rare, and is rumored to have been made by The Supreme himself. Those who are aware of him will note that the potion is not like the others.

History:

Pertinax the Supreme, or Perseus the Great, as he was also known, was a great warrior who was known for his combat ability, his ability to fight whole battalions alone, and for his ability to travel the planes. He also became famous for having made this magic potion, which was intended for use as an instant meal.

It is said that he and other heroes of old would drink the potion before going into battle, giving them instant access to the armor that they were wearing. This would also provide them with a good set of armor, and would also make them more supreme.

This potion would also give them access to a buff that would make them more resistent to magic, and would also allow them to move around the battlefield with a lot more ease. It is believed that because those who drank the potion before going into battle would gain more experience, the potion would help them gain experience faster.

It is also said that the potion was a favorite of Perseus because he was the one to invent the potion, and he also knew how to use it best.

He had a kind, altruistic heart and a love for knowledge. He was able to tame a wild beast and use it as a steed for his excursions. He wanted to see the surface world, but his studies required more time before he could leave. What might the surface world be like? He wondered, not knowing that the answer was near.

Personality:

Fendigin has a kind, altruistic heart. He is a bit of a dreamer and has a hard time paying attention, but that doesn’t stop him from trying. He’s never been more than a few miles away from his home, and the sight of the kingdom of Grabisco is unlike anything he was expecting.

Their philosophy was to let the listener have the power to understand what they said. They didn't want to force the meaning of the songs on to the listeners. They thrived by having little respect for the hierarchy that the king ran and did not have much respect for the kingdom as a whole. They did not care about the order of the day and often did as they wished. As such, many became little more than a nuisance to the king and others.

Rarity: Legendary

Special Abilities:

(Summon Creature) (Invisibility) (Sonic Damage) (Animate Item)

(Transmute)

Description:

This potion is clear in color, but has a very strange smell. It is said that the plan to create this potion came about during a heated discussion on the subject of Alchemy between Ekkos the Reverie, and a noble who was his friend. Despite the fact that Ekkos and his friend had been friends for many years, they still often argued about the correct ways to do things, especially when it came to Alchemy.

It is rumored that this potion was created by accident, and that the argument both created the spell and the potion. This is, very likely, not true. This is yet another potion which has a very short shelf life. It must be made fresh each time it's to be used, and a few drops of it must be mixed into a gallon of water, and then let sit for a couple of days. For those who desire the best experience with this potion, in order to get the most out of it, they should drink it slowly and in small amounts.

History:

Ekkos was a Paladin in the army of the king of Errakion, and his name was well known among the people until one day he left. No one knows why he left but people are still wondering about him. It is rumored that he went to the far south to study magic. He spent years there, mastering the art of Alchemy.

When he returned, he immediately made a potion which would allow him to become invisible, and this was his favorite potion. It is said that he traveled all over the world in secret until the king called for his help in a battle against the Undead.
Ekkos, being a Paladin, was unable to refuse and ended up sacrificing his own life in the battle. Even though he was already dead, he had somehow managed to live on as a spirit. This is yet another one of his creations, and it is said that he still travels the world with it.

This is yet another potion which has a very short shelf life. It must be made fresh each time it's to be used, and a few drops of it must be mixed into a gallon of water, and then let sit for a couple of days. This potion is often used by wizards to make them stronger in battle.

History:

Puk was a warrior-mage who was nothing short of mighty. He had great strength that was coupled with a strong will. This potion was created by Puk himself, and it is rumored that after drinking it, people can grow older, taller, stronger, and even disappear. It is not known if this is true because
Puk is not known to have ever drank it, instead handing the recipe off to his friends.

Also, being that Puk disappeared mysteriously, many believed that he just decided to move away to another village. Puk was a good man who was well loved by his friends as well as by his enemies. Some say that he would do everything in his power to help his friends, but when it came to his enemies, he was almost as evil as they were, and he would go out of his way to make their lives miserable.

Born in The Village of Sularin

Nalissa was born into a family of troglodytes that worshiped the god Urgutsko. When she was younger, Nalissa was an obedient and dutiful daughter, but she grew to resent her father as she grew older. She realized he was not actually a true warlock and that she could do better.

She went searching for answers that could help her grow in power. She traveled to the Underdark east of the kingdom of Grabisco and convinced a group of warlocks there to teach her. They were impressed by her determination, as it took her years to learn.

She soon assembled a group of devoted followers, who were intent on killing anyone who stood in the way of their new religion.

Qzathoth

Male Troglodyte Illusionist

Born in The Underbartle

Backstory:

Qzathoth’s father was a sorcerer and his mother a troglodyte, which is considered an abomination by the troglodytes, despite his father’s power. Qzathoth was shunned by his own family and raised elsewhere. His mother did not want to go against tradition, so she handed him over to his father to be raised and taught the ways of magic.

Qzathoth grew to hate his father and the people of the Underbartle for the things they did and for the way they treated him. One day, Qzathoth got a chance to express his discontent when he discovered a tunnel that lead out of the Underbartle.

He knew he would be exiled if he left, so he sneaked in and out of his new home as he learned more about the world above. He discovered a temple of Zan and started worshiping it, slowly becoming an acolyte. He soon
engineered an attack on the temple where he spent his childhood and slaughtered everyone present, including his own father.

Special Mage Skill:

Faerunian Divination

Skill made famous by Bazzelflan, the Mage

(Magic) (Active) (Divination) (Zan) (Zannites)

Description

This mage spell might be the most difficult spell for a mage to learn because it is so difficult to actually cast. It was developed by Bazzelflan and is a spell that was developed from the magic of the "other" world. Bazzelflan himself was not sure, but he was convinced that there was something different about the magic of the Zannites.
After long discussions with a Zannite priest by the name of Gilga, Bazzelflan developed this mage spell. The spell is a situation spell that will allow the mage to get insight into the current situation at hand. Unfortunately, it requires that the mage be able to cast the spell while in a special area.

That area is the "high place" that the Zannites use. It is located in the Zannite area of the Vast Swamp. A mage who wishes to learn this spell should ask one of the Zannite priests how to get there. The priest will most likely want the mage to earn her way to this "high place" by doing a quest for the Zannites.

Since this spell is so difficult to cast, a mage might wish to pay his friend to take him to this "high place." And then, after he has learned how to cast the spell, he might even be able to pay his friend to cast it for him.

The person who drinks this potion will become invisible for a short period of time, depending on the caster's skill, but will become visible again when she takes any action or moves too much. This potion, much like the other, has a very short shelf life.

History:

Efemel was a woman who was a freelance writer, and much of what she wrote was about magic. One day, she conjured up this potion, and she began to use it to her own advantage. It was rumored that she took advantage of the power of this potion, and used it to her own liking.

Jhushik's Potion of Animation

Created by Jhushik the Cerebrex

Item Type: Potion

For Levels: 4 - 30

Rarity: Epic

Special Abilities:

(Summon Creature) (Stat Bonus) (Raise Dead) (Animate Dead) (Animate)

(Animation)

Description:

This potion is orange in color and smells sweet. It is said that this is one of the best inventions in the world of Tibia, and it is also one of the most powerful. Jhushik was known to be a member of a tribe which was oppressed by others, and so he studied the effects of certain potions over the years, and this eventually led to him creating this one.

He then used the potion to surprise his enemies, but apparently not all was well, as his tribe would not survive the war. No one knows why, but it is said that he once owned a dog. Perhaps this has something to do with his tribe's extinction.

This potion is different from others in that it does not need to be stored properly, and it also does not need to be made fresh in order to be effective. This potion lasts indefinitely, and so you can store it wherever you want. It can be carried on you at any time, and will give you the benefits of the potion for as long as you use it.
History:

Jhushik is well known to be a rather unique individual. Once he was taunted by friends, so he created a potion which actually allowed himself to become "animated". When he did this, he was able to frighten all those who had made fun of him. He then put a piece of cloth around his neck which had the inscription, "Jhushik is the one who has power and the power is mine." This phrase is now known to be of some importance, but as to how much, no one really knows.

So, she traveled far off into the world, seeking her fortune. She became an entertainer, using her innate magic to help her perform all sorts of tricks. She resented the fact that she was not more powerful and thought that the training that she received was less than adequate.

If the potion is consumed in this way, the user will find himself in the middle of an ocean, no matter where he was before.

History:
It is rumored that the inventor of this potion, A.Z., was the greatest explorer of his time. He was also said to have been a wizard, well known for his studies in nature. He was known to go into the Halcyon Ocean, which is known to be a dangerous place full of creatures that not even the best warrior would dare to fight and live, and study the wildlife there.

Many of his friends and family begged him not to go, but he told them, "If one is to be a wizard, one must start with the most basic of all things." He then left on his journey. At the time, no one knew where he went or what happened to him, but it is said that he returned after many years, and then he began to concoct his potion.

He was said to have suddenly disappeared after that, but people say that he is still roaming the land, creating wonderous potions for all to try.

Female Goblin Sorcerer

Born in The Sleazy Inn in Bartlegaard

Backstory:

Urok was an orphan growing up in the sleazy inn. She was a pickpocket and generally caused trouble whenever she could. One night a man came by looking for a room. He paid a good price, but as he went up to his room, Urok followed him.

She heard scratching and moaning from his room. Curious, she snuck into his room and found him being devoured by ghouls. They spotted her but she was able to escape. They found her again the next day, this time beating her until she fled.

Since then, her goal has been to avenge her murdered parents and co-workers. She was able to learn a few spells from her dead relatives and a spellbook she stole from the bandits that killed her parents.

She has been honing her skills and looking for the best opportunity to strike back at her enemies.

Urok is a loner. She sees everyone else as competition, and she’s quick to throw a punch at any of them if she thinks they’re getting close. She’s a natural at magic, but she’s also quick with a dagger and she’s skilled at running away.

Appearance:

Urok is little more than skin and bones. She sticks out in a crowd with her ratty, torn robes, long crooked nose, and tousled black hair that she tries to keep hidden under a cap.

Start of Character:

Spell:






















Rol Squeakfang

Male Goblin Wizard

Born in The Swamp of the Evil Wizard

Backstory:

At least, this is the place Rol was born. He remembers nothing before being a young adult. He was the runt of the litter and was often bullied by his peers. When he got bigger, he gave as good as he got. His friends tried to persuade him to leave his frog people and go adventuring, but Rol wanted to stay.

That was until one day, he came back from the swamp and discovered his village had been, for the most part, destroyed. After searching the swamp for a while, he discovered the reason behind the destruction: a band of evil adventurers.

From that day on, he decided to become an adventurer himself, chasing down the group and bringing them to justice.

Personality:
Rol can come off a bit bossy. He can also come off as a pompous ass. He can be overly confident and is inclined to talk down to others as if he is superior to them. He believes that he has what it takes to be the best, but he hasn’t had a chance to prove himself yet.

Appearance:

Rol’s skin is green and his nose is pointed. His eyes are beady black. The rest of his features are human-like. Beneath the bones is a green suit of armor. He carries a short sword and a small shield when he’s not using his staff. His staff is covered in runes and made of wood. It’s a proud staff.

Start of Character:

Rol is chasing after the adventurers, determined to bring them to justice for the destruction of his village.

Staff:

Staff of the Necromancer | The Staff of the Man of Chaos

Created by M0th3rF0x

Item Type: Staff

For Levels: 1 - 101

Rarity: Epic

Special Abilities:

(x2 Damage) (Elemental Magic) (Disintegrate)

Description:
This staff is made of a dark brown magical material that doesn't reflect light. It is a very strong staff, but not a very pretty one. It is cracked through the center on one side and has a strange glowing effect on it. On the other side is a strange symbol that no one but the Man of Chaos and the Necromancer know what it is.

This staff was given to the Necromancer by the Man of Chaos, and the Necromancer used it as a focus to his spells. The staff is lit by a pulsating crimson light and a mysterious symbol on the other side glows in the same color. The staff feels very warm to the touch and is a bit uncomfortable to the wielder.

History:

Many years ago, the Man of Chaos was known as the most powerful mage in all of Tridell. He was rumored to have made a deal with the devil, Nynefex, the God of Darkness and Curses. He began to practice evil magic, and he made many weapons, but his most favorite weapon was the Staff of Bane.

It was said that the Staff of Bane was a master of the elements, and the Man of Chaos was able to use the staff to control the elements using it. The Staff of Bane was said to be a powerful weapon that could only be wielded by the most powerful person.

The Man of Chaos used the Staff of Bane to fight off an evil wizard named Starns. It is said that Starns was once mortal, but after some very evil acts, he had his body taken over by evil spirits. The spirits used his body as a place to inhabit for their own use.

The spirits were evil and they wanted to do evil things to many people. Starns had an alliance with the God of Darkness, Nynefex, and they began to practice magic together.

They both created plans on how to rule the world. Both operate from the Dark Lands, raising a legion of undead to threaten Grabisco and other nearby kingdoms.

Rumbleslob

Male Goblin Wizard

Born in Neldoreth

Backstory:

A member of the goblin tribe led by Orgeron, Rumbleslob lived his early life in the shadows of the larger, more powerful goblins in his tribe. He was mocked for his small stature and, to make things worse, he was naturally clumsy.

As a young goblin, he was constantly picked on by the stronger goblins in the tribe, which often led to fights. After one particularly brutal fight, two of the tribe’s shamans came to him and anointed him as a shaman of the tribe. They taught him their magic, which he was only too happy to learn.

Rumbleslob grew into a strong, capable warrior. Years later, Rumbleslob has gained the respect of his tribe and is looked up to as a leader. He hopes to one day lead his tribe in an assault against the humans, and take over the lands of the humans for his own.

Personality:

Small and a bit clumsy, Rumbleslob is a surprisingly friendly and outgoing individual. He loves to chat and joke around, and he has a way of putting
people at ease. Sometimes he takes teasing and jokes too far, which can lead to a bad situation.

When that happens, Rumbleslob will sometimes fly into a rage. He can relax instantly once the situation is over. Sometimes Rumbleslob can overdo just about anything.

His orange eyes and green skin give him away as a half-ogre. He’s pretty big, standing at almost 5 feet tall. He has green hair and a scraggly beard. He wears leather armor studded with metal. He carries a dwarven battle axe with him at all times.

Spell:


Summon Chicken


(Food) (Chicken) (Eat) (Poultry) (Arcane)

Conjuration spell

Created by Dralin

Cost: 60 Mana

Components

A live chicken.

Description
Summons a chicken. It is a very weak spell, and lasts only for a few minutes. It can be used in combat, or in the kitchen. It is a good spell for new magi with little experience in casting. However, if used in the kitchen, little or no surplus magic should be left over.

Dralin, the mage that created this spell, said this about the spell. "My original intention for the spell was to assist students in the kitchen. However, my apprentice used it in combat to great effect. I believe it's an excellent spell for a beginning mage, as it will not leave my apprentice with too much surplus magic left over. I know that when I was a young mage, I made the mistake of over-flinging spells in combat. After the combat, I had to spend a day recovering. My apprentice made the same mistake. I wonder if any other young mages out there are making the same mistake I did when I was young. I sincerely hope not!”

Editor’s Note:

Chicken attack!

A doctor came from Jarstiz and told them he was infected with a serious disease. The doctor gave them a potion and a few bags of sand and went on his way. One day, the healer came back and asked about the sand. He made his way to their home and collected it, then killed the two women.

He quickly hired an instructor to tutor him in magic.

He took to the art of enchantment almost immediately. Ilemon appreciated the creative freedom that magic allowed and the way that it could be used to solve problems and exploit opportunities. Soon, he realized that the arts of the mind were far superior to any other pursuits.

He turned his focus to magic, channeling more and more of his efforts into the discovery of new spells and rituals. His teachers advised him to use his powers for profit or to advance his career, but Ilemon could not stand the idea of profiting off something he enjoyed so much.

Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz'Urb-luu, and Vrissar the Abyssal Noble.

Spells
1.Charm Monster (DC 17) - You can charm an animal, humanoid, or magical beast with a maximum Hit Dice of 6. The target is charmed in a manner similar to the charm monster spell, except that the maximum HD of the creature that can be affected increases to 6.

2.Greater Command (DC 22) - You can force a creature with up to 15 Hit Dice to obey your commands for 1 round. Anything the target is commanded to do takes only a standard action to perform. At the end of the round, the target makes a Will save to regain its own mind. If the save is successful, the effect ends. A creature with 15 or more Hit Dice is unaffected by this spell.
3.Spell-Storing Item - You can store a single targeted spell of up to 3rd level in the item. Any creature with an Intelligence score of at least 2 can access the spell. The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less and can target only a creature that you have touched. A creature that knows the password (determined by you at the time of casting) can cast the spell from the item by touching the target and using the password as part of the casting (as if delivering the spell touch attack).
