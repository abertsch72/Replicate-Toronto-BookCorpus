Introduction
These are the poems of my teenage years. Reading them after 60+ years, I was surprised that so many dealt with death & dying. That was the time when our country was in its great struggle of WWII. My older brother was in the Army Air Corps, and Air Force cadets were studying meteorology at Vanderbilt. My father, Dr W B Jewell, Chairman of the Geology Department, taught advanced geography to most of the cadets. At West End High School, a number of my male friends, or my brother John’s friends, were already overseas. Several were killed at the Battle of the Bulge in the Ardennes. Naturally we all worried about their safety. But many of the boys were eager to enlist. Americans were united in support of the war effort. One of my brother’s best friends spent 2 years in a Nazi concentration camp. He survived, but when he came for dinner after being released, he said he never wanted to eat another potato!
On the “home front” we faced rationing of butter, sugar, & gasoline. We learned about margarine & nylons. Movies were filled with high melodrama and we looked up to famous celebrities who left to fight overseas – Jimmy Stewart & Ted Williams, among many others…

Captivity
If only from my soul could issue forth
My purest aims, embodied in wild song,
So that their trembling notes would fill the earth
With courage that would make the weak man strong,
I would breathe words to make dying men feel
That they had strength to draw another breath,
And songs to make the coward scorn to kneel,
Trembling, before the personage of Death.
My melody could give each child just born
A glimpse of gleaming heights where he might rise;
This goal in view, he would wear wings of morn,
Whose plumes paint brilliantly the sinless skies.
Yet these songs in my soul must captive lie,
Bound by the bars of earth, until I die.
The Helmsman
My days are wrought with many dreams,
Idle visions of a fairer world:
With him beside me, my life is
As a sturdy ship with sails unfurled,
Her prow nosed in an angry sea;
Her banners flung to the eastern sky
With defiance for the storms of life
Waiting to set my hopes awry;
And standing firmly at the wheel,
His feet braced wide, his shoulders square,
Unmindful of the stinging spray
That dampens both his face and hair,
Is the helmsman. His jaw is set;
His green eyes, clear, upon the sea;
This ship must safely reach its port,
In answer to my trusting plea.
… Aside from dreams …
My ship will never reach its port,
Or weather any of life’s gales
If my pilot does not take the wheel—
For without him, every dream will fail.
A Poem Is A Little Thing
A poem is a little thing—
The words of one
Who was born to sing
Without accompaniment;
Yet when,
Within the hearts of men,
His words, their destinies fulfill,
All other music of the world,
And of the stars—
Is still.
Portrait II
Dark brows,
Often in anger striving to unite
In one black line of danger.
Amber eyes,
Reflecting the churning waters
Of a turbulent soul—
At times, the light
Playing on the dappled surface
Of a quiet pool;
At times, submerged
To depths
Unchartered by a single beam of light.
Small mouth,
The corners an indicator
Of moods
As fluid,
As predictable,
As the course of an ant
Confronted by a human foot.
Line of cheek and jaw,
Resolute and immovable
As time.
Lift of the chin,
Upward.
Yet were I
Maker of the universe,
This is one atom of the human race
I would not alter.
Loneliness
A dark shadow,
Alone
In the swirling pastel mists
Of gaiety,
Bows low,
Unseen,
Unheard,
Ashamed
Of its obscurity.
The Ways I Miss You
I miss you in the sunset’s blood,
I miss you in a flower bud,
Unopened,
Kissed by dew.
I miss you in the ticking clocks,
I miss you in a letter box
Filled
With dear memories.
I miss you in a glowing fire,
I miss you in a church’s spire
Reaching
Up to God.
I miss you in a withered leaf,
I miss you when I see the grief
Of others.
I miss you when I try to write,
And when I see the street light
Where we stood
Together.
I miss you in the sadness of a spaniel’s eyes,
I miss you in the dawn of Autumn skies—
Clear,
And cloudless.
I miss you when I want to cry,
And when I see two lovers say goodbye
The way
We did.
I miss you in my sorrows,
And I shall miss you all the todays and the tomorrows
Till it be
That we shall meet again.
I missed you from the start;
In all these I miss you—
But above all, Beloved,
I miss you in my heart.
Winter
Beauty has deserted her earth,
And the skies are faded.
The music of the planetary winds
Is now but discord.
The world is naked,
And dead.
Why should I pilgrimage with birds,
Seeking life?
I shall stay here,
Here with death,
For my tears helped to streak that faded sky;
Winter and I are old friends—
Why should I leave?
Apostrophe To Morning
O wings of Morn,
If only thou didst have the power
To raise my soul,
That in one shimmering hour
From out the abyss of eternity,
It might view, beyond the shades of night,
That stainless shore
To which all singers of immortal songs
Repair their bodies
Soon or late;
Then,
O gilt-veiled purity,
Could I sing to man
My song;
And it would be the hymn of beauty;
And on its wings might the broken rise
To view the stainless shore
Beyond the shades of night.
Two Loves
Of these two loves have I tasted,
As different as curses and prayers;
The first had the taste of new wine—
Claret, sparkling and rare;
It parched my mouth as I drank;
When the last drop was drained, my throat ached;
While the other had the savor of bread
That was warm, and freshly baked.
I scarcely noticed its flavor,
I screamed for the wine denied;
Yet when I arose from that table,
I was nourished and satisfied.
Christmas – 1943
The earth lies sterile,
Beneath the livid scars
Wrought by the scythe
Of Death.
The virgin snow is stained,
Indelibly,
With the life stream
Of the valiant.
Stretching toward
The sky of tears,
The blackened fields,
Which once were gilded
By the gold of grain,
Bear their mute testimony
To the God of peace.
Yet the sterile earth,
The blackened fields,
The blood-stained snow,
Still raise,
Though silently,
The eternal
Hymn of praise
That there is still,
Amid the blackness
Of a world gone mad,
Hope.
Hope,
Embodied in
One bright shining star.
Hope, which,
Germinated by
The warmth of faith
And tears of joy,
Shall spring
From the sterile earth,
From the blackened fields,
Once more,
The green
Of the eternal spring.
(This poem won the Nashville city poetry contest of 1944 and placed third in the Tennessee state poetry contest of 1944.)
Storm
Night is an ebony slave
Who bows
Before the throne of Evil;
But, when the Furies
Of his master’s wrath
Are loosed,
His back is smote with the whip
Of lightning.
He groans;
The earth trembles in terror—
And lies silent.
(Published in the 1944 National Anthology of High School Poetry with honorable mention.
The Snow Of Peace
The snow of peace is drifting gently
From the starless night of war,
Each transparent flake an unuttered prayer.
In the World,
That great city of the human race,
Children of nations laugh and play
Together,
Once more.
In the background,
Squat factories belch smoke contentedly
On a diet
Of rocket and atomic bombs.
Soon,
The purest snowdrift
Will be covered once again
With soot.
Beyond The Moon
Men call it loneliness,
Yet how can tongues
Devise a name
For the barren wasteland
Where I found myself?
By day,
The glare of others’ happiness
Blinded
My searching eyes;
By night,
Pale fire of stars
Lured me
To magic worlds
Where Beauty reigns.
Then—
Dawn found but hot sands,
And Desire’s parched throat
Gasped for the cooling waters
Beyond the moon …
Desolately through the years,
I stumbled onward,
And Hope,
Ever my guide,
Began to call me “Fool”.
Those lonely nights,
Each rustle
Of the black lace trees
Was but a sob to me.
At length,
I fell,
Senseless,
To the burning floor
Of my despair.
When I awoke,
The cooling fingers
Of Spring Rain
Stroked my fevered head.
The fingers
Led me up the rainbow’s arch,
And as I neared its end,
Heaven’s own guardian
Stood waiting
In the pastel mists—
One kiss,
And I had tasted
The waters—
Beyond the moon.
God Made My Heart
God made my heart
From a thousand petals of the summer’s rose
That fell at dawn;
He mixed with it the liquid, colored notes
Of linnets
Singing to the spotted clouds;
He covered it
With wings of frailest luna moths;
Then painted it with violet dew
From stately fringèd gentians;
For God knew
Only the beautiful
Could come
As gifts to you.
Sketch
A gnarled figure,
Bent,
Desolate;
Feeble rays of hope
Choked
By the formless fingers
Of the Fog;
Echoes of a phantom’s footsteps;
Silence.
Sonnet On Graduation
You have become a traveler now, dear heart;
A single piece of parchment made it so;
In amber clouds of dawn it has its start,
The road ahead, and you are free to go.
Your eyes are golden east, but look again
Where ragged purple clouds now dim the west,
In that vague distance is your journey’s end;
Beneath the purple hills will you find rest.
The road that separates the two is long,
And on its way will come work’s weariness,
But if, within your soul, you have a song,
There will be, for the heartbreak, happiness.
Dear heart, just sing this song your youth began,
And you will reach the purple hills, a man.
Pianist
The fingers of a soul
Move swiftly,
And a dormant river
Of pulsing melody
Flows forth,—
And is still.
My Love Grows Deep
My love grows deep,
Deep in my soul;
It is watered by tears,
And grows,
A shade from the withering heat
Of desire.
Sweet and cool,
And silence-tinted,
Its roots reach out,
And fasten me to you.
Death Of A Rose
O glowing rose on yonder graceful vine,
Thy tiny crimson bud of fire so fair,
The dewdrops on thy silken petals shine
As brilliantly as sparkling jewels rare.
And all the other flowers envy thee,
For thou alone of them art blessed of God;
Thou bloomest in eternal memory
Of those reposing on a couch of sod.
Thy velvet leaves fall slowly to the grass,
And there are trodden ’neath the feet of men;
The carelessness of these blind souls who pass
Returns to dust thy beauty once again
And there on earth marks where the angels bled.
I weep; the rose of life must soon be dead.
A Song
Knives,
Blue and gleaming;
Shapeless blotches
On four straight walls;
The odor of stars,
And small black dogs
Running
In circles.
Black plumes
Of ancient trees,
Trying in vain to sweep
The dusty cobwebs
From the sky.
Clocks and hearts—
Beating,
Beating.
A pattern,
Octagons and hexagons
On a square rug,
In a square room
With square windows;
The feel of veined hands
And a dead leaf;
The beating wings
Of human moths
Trying to reach a light.
You Are Angels’ Choirs
There lurks somewhere,
Within the pastel colored mists of morning,
One golden note,
One liquid note,
That I would bring to you.
But I,
The humble singer,
Find myself unworthy
To even hum the sweet refrain
Of you;
For I know only trills of birds,
And tunes the wind plays
On the harp of trees;
While you are angels’ choirs,
And haunting notes of violins
Like sunbeams
Through the stained glass window
Of a church.
Blood
The moon was the color of blood that night,
And the mist hung thick as smoke;
I had fallen asleep with a heart in my breast
That was still when I awoke.
For the blood that had coursed through my veins was gone,
It sailed with the Navy’s fleet;
It was warm and alive in another chest,
Why should my heart still beat?
The sun was the color of blood that morn,
Parched earth shone dull in its rays,
And the emerald grass hung with ropes of pearls
Seemed to wither before my gaze.
I belonged to life, yet death claimed me, too,
With a stronger bond than I knew,
Yet the warning had stirred in my silent soul
Before the battle was through.
The sea was the color of blood that day,
His ship was the color of death;
The fog hung low like a velvet veil;
Death laughed at his every breath.
With my face in his heart, and my name on his lips,
And my blood singing through his veins,
He raised his eyes to the droning skies—
Then he saw the enemy planes.
His chest was the color of blood at dusk,
And my life was in every drop,
And that stain still spreads with a hungry flow
That only a peace can stop.
A Butterfly and a Man’s Mind
A butterfly and a man’s mind—
Not so different;
A whim veers both
From the steady course
They chartered;
The mind of man
Flutters along
On the path
Prescribed
By the wind
Of opinion.
But, perhaps,
In this they differ:
A butterfly
Is beautiful.
To Nicky
You believed in me.
And from the simple faith
You had for others,
A song was born,
And in this song you live.
When, for the last time,
I laid my hand
Upon your shaggy head,
It was not to say “good-bye”,
But only,
“Good night, Nicky”,
As I had said so many times.
For there was One who said:
“He who believes in Me
Shall never taste death.”
And so—
Good night, my dearest friend.

The Fool
I am the fool:
I see pale fire of stars,
And they are mine.
I think of others,
But feed my own hunger
On the moldy bread of poverty.
Then there is the bat,
The dark bat,
Flying against the darker fingers
Of the trees;
And a cold mist—
What good is it to scream?
To rail against the loom
Of Destiny?
Who is there beside me
But the sea?
Who can hear me but the sun?
I am the fool:
I see beauty in a flower petal,
Ice pink,
Chiseled by a silver knife,
Tempered in the white hot fire
Of distant stars.
I dance—
I laugh—
Liquid silver laughter—
Laughter made of icicles
With the sun shining on them.
Then there is the bat,
The dark bat,
Flying against the darker fingers
Of the trees;
And a cold mist—
Every sunrise I am born again—
There is new life;
Yet when the clouds
Are but gray ashes,
I see
That there is very little life
In ashes.
I am the fool:
In my pregnant dream
I write wild words
To make another feel
What I have felt—
The sweet and bitter joy
Of chartreuse water
And chiffon of clouds—
But the bat keeps flying,
The great, dark, silent bat—
The fingers stir—
They are restless—
The mist sways, too—
……
There will be other centuries,
Other ages—
Mountains will be ground to ant hills,
And rivers shall consume it all;
Men will go to Heaven and to Hell;
But I shall still be here—
I am the fool:
I am timeless.
……
It will not be long—
Eternity is not a long time
When you have seen it as I have—
It will not be long
Until the great dark bat stops flying,
And the darker fingers of the trees
Lift my dry bones,—
And hold them.
Then, only, have I the right
To love.
For when I am dead
No one can rend my flesh.
Now—
I am the fool:
Yet when I die,
I shall be the wisest person
In the universe.
My Love Has Wings
I love my love with a love
Stronger than the Sea at flood-tide
That rushes over defenseless sand,
Almost up to the rock-strewn land,
And lies there, chanting.
I can stand on the jagged cliff
And cry to the Sea,
“You are weak beside my love!
For you can only rush over sand,
Almost up to the rock-strewn land,
While my love has wings to fly
Over you, Sea, and the rock-strewn land,
Up to the sky!”
The Circle Incomplete
O God,
O thou Eternal One—
Who mad’st me mortal flesh
And then created Love, divine,
Must I forever be condemned
To worship at her shrine?
Hast thou willed
That I must ever wander,
In the cloak of night,
Searching for one flicker
Of her perfect light?
O Love,
Thou unattainable—
Why can I hear no symphony
In his heart’s beat?
Why is, in flesh and flesh combined,
The circle incomplete?
Why can he not bring other gifts to me
Than passion’s fire?
Why must he always worship
In the temple of desire?
Frames
Why should windows be square,
Their corners sharp?
Divided into four equal portions,
Ugly in their symmetry?
My windows shall be curved
To frame the moon.
Love’s Questions
I
Do you know, Beloved,
What it is
To reach out trembling hands
And part the gossamer veil
That dims a star?
Have you sung with thrushes
The wild music of the living universe,
And heard the aged hills
Blend in the harmony?
Can you fling wide your arms
And clasp the turquoise sky to you,
Close to your breast,
Until it bathes you in its coolness?
Have you sat in stillness,
And heard the dusk draped trees
Whisper you a name,
Again,
And again?
II
Beloved, you must know—
You who cut the chains
That bound me to this earth—
For it was with your hand in mine
I pulled away ethereal veils;
And with the tongue you gave my singing heart,
I joined the thrushes’ choir.
It was in your arms
I felt the turquoise sky press close around me,
A clinging veil.
And when I sit alone
The lips of breezes whisper me a name—
And it is your name,
Beloved,
Your name.
1945–05–28
My Love Is The Singing Sands
I love you as I love the Night—
The tall, straight, noble Night
Who stands above the singing sands,
And carries for a torch, the moon.
I love you as I love the Day—
That gentle maiden I have watched at play,
A bunch of yellow flowers in her fair right hand.
I love you as I love them,
For you are Night and Day to me, my dear, and more.
You are the singing sands,
The bunch of flowers in a maiden’s hands,
And more, my dear,
And more.
Creation’s Dream
In the exalted minds of a selected few,
In youth is dreamed creation’s dream.
This dream, shaped in the flexible fingers
Of a master sculptor,
Is molded,
Polished,
Worked
Until the shapeless mass of putty
Hardens in the simple, flowing lines of grace—
A thing of beauty—
A spark cast in the tinder of a painter’s brain
Until a formless splotch of color
Creates upon bleak wastes of board
The inward impression of the mind and soul,—
A thing of wonder—
A mute plea to a poet’s pen
To utter the vision
Which the lesser minds pervert,
And which is only viewed
By the unseen eye of the master’s quill
Transforming blank parchment
To an everlasting song—
A thing of creation—
A germ of being,
Restless to be born
Of a master’s golden tongue,
To rise,
Mist-veiled,
From the inanimate—
A thing conceived.
Shall this germ be given life and growth?
For this dream, there is but one,
And that is death.
And so in darkness,
Fortune at her wheel
Spins endlessly the shroud of fate
In which to cloak creation’s dream,
When it is dead.
Our Love In Ten Metaphors
Our love is the music of a peacock feather trailed across the supple strings of marsh grass;
Our love is an angel’s web, spun of pale green moths to catch the pastel pearls of scented rain;
Our love is the twilight-colored lace of shadows, clinging gently to a topaz tower;
Our love is the silver fingers of a birch plucking the wind’s white harp;
Our love is the golden medallion of the sun, suspended on the sky’s bright dress by a purple velvet ribbon of clouds;
Our love is a drift of petal snow beneath a tree of violets;
Our love is soft satin lakes brushed by a swan’s white hand;
Our love is the taste of frosty stars on linnets’ tongues;
Our love is all the perfumes of the moon, mingled in the lily’s ivory throat;
Our love is a liquid moonbeam, imprisoned in the red cup of a lover’s heart.
For Every Crimson Streak
O man, art thou so blind thou would destroy
Thyself in war? To kill another’s son
Is but to tear the heart from out thy boy.
The vict’ry cannot be in battles won,
For every crimson streak that marks the field
Is a defeat for those who yet draw breath;
And those who still the dripping sword would wield
Shall someday smell the heavy stench of death
That rises from the bones of their firstborn.
For brutish war spares none; and even those
Who deify its name, it turns to scorn,
To write their names in blood beside their foes’.
O man, sweep not thyself away as sand:
I beg thee—sheathe the sword; extend the hand!
Love
Love is like a river,
Swift and strong,
That flows into the ocean of the soul,
And quickens the wave-beats of the heart
Until they dash the cliffs of reasoning
To nothingness.
“The American Way Of Life”
He makes it simple, the poet of today,
Trying to define “the American way
Of life”.
Wading through words, the poet paints scenes,
Trying to tell what America means
To the grim-lipped boys going off to war,
Trying to tell “what they’re fighting for”,—
His scenes are vivid, and here they are;
The chaos, confusion, when the whistle blows
And it’s quitting time, and God only knows
The relief in your heart, the working man
To be able to stop and rest again
From the endless grinding of greased machines
In the mammoth plants where winches scream,
And the tools of war go rolling past
To kill and kill, for the dye is cast
That freedom shall live…
Standing knee-deep in a field of wheat,
Watching gold earth and flecked sky meet,
Bowing your head in a thankful prayer
That this is Kansas, and you live there…
In the Washington office, like a cage,
Figures march down a ledger page,
Row after row in dark array,
Till the clock in its mercy ends the day,
And you wage your war with the subway crowd
Till you trudge toward home, tired, but proud
Of your place in the world…
The thunder of breakers on rocky shores,
Watching their fury, thrilled to the core,
You pause from your task of drying nets
Bathed in the fire of a Maine sunset;
And you thrill to the thoughts of this day’s catch
Of bluefish and bass – the finest batch
In many a day. But your heart beats more
At the ocean’s roar,
The swooping of seagulls, their screaming cries,
The sting of salt spray that blinds the eyes
And opens the soul…
Watching your child each passing year,
While in your heart is the growing fear
Of the day
When standing alone on a barren hill,
With the night above him, somber and still,
With the stars so white, and his God so near,
He knows why he lives; why life is dear.
And suddenly in a few thoughts span,
Where once a child, he is now a man.
And on and on the poet goes,
While in his mind, more pictures grow;
He does his best, and it’s well and good,
But the poet has never washed in blood.
Can he know what it is to fly through flak,
Brave all hell, – and then – not come back?
How can he know what it is to lie
In the mud of a foxhole, and slowly die
Of gangrene?
Perhaps it’s more than mere routine—
A plow, a desk, a greased machine—
That is in the thoughts of a Marine
Who has time to think.
Then for what do they die, if not for those?
I don’t know, and no one knows.
Perhaps, because they think it’s just;
Or, more than likely, because they must.
Sonnet On Humility
If I may only stand outside the door
That bars me from the banquet of your love,
And eat the crumbs that richer guests shall shove
Disdainfully upon the gaudy floor;
If I in meek servility may see
Them leave the orgy for their lives of ease,
And then drink from their cups of gladness, lees,
As nectar from the heart’s red cup to me;
If that be mine, I have no cause to cry,
For from that time, thirst shall I never know—
The dregs I taste shall be an unchecked flow
To feed the soul’s sweet springs which cannot dry;
Then shall I never hunger, though not fed—
The crumbs shall be sun’s honey on life’s bread.
Darkness And White Lace
Gentle is my love as folds of lace,
And radiant as a candle’s shining face;
Simple is it as a taper’s sloping lines,
Pure as the virgin light which from it shines;
My love is tearful as the tallow’s noiseless fall,
As understanding as the darkness of an empty hall.
My love for thee is darkness and white lace
On which a candle, with its silent flame, says grace.
Requiescat In Pace
We begot Love,
You and I—
Love, our first born—
And we clothed her
In lunar brocades,
And held her in our arms;
We heard her laugh
As though an angel
Played upon a lyre
Whose strings were silver fire.
We watched her run to us—
Her hair like willow leaves—
Trailing,
Curving—
And took her hand,
Flesh clothed
In petals of a rose,
Then ran with her—
Our child,
Our first born—
Into the lilac night.
In one satin hand,
She held the small pearl dagger
That you made for her
From words.
Suddenly
Cloud draperies closed
Upon the windows of the stars.
In faltering dark,
Love fell,
The satin hand still clenched.
Blood’s liquid fire flamed bright
Upon her breast,
And died grey ash.
She is dead ………
The child begotten of us,
Our first born………
………
………
I will bury her
Beneath the pear tree;
There only a drift
Of petal snow
Will mark her grave.
Sonnet On Desire
To feel the wild sweet warmth of you, my own,
By reaching out my soul; to gently feel
Curved chest, arm-sinews, pulses never known
Save by the sea’s fierce surge ’gainst naked keel;
To kindle fires in hollows of my form
And feel them blossom in bright aching pain
That veils and bathes the flesh in violent storm
And then knows calm caress of tender rain—
The kiss of supple lips; the quiv’ring stir,
Delicious message of a finger’s touch
Sent through the veins, the heart’s electric murmur
Of “I desire so much – so much—”
With these, no need for heaven and rebirth—
I find the love divine upon this earth.
The Guardian Of The Wood
You came and found me wandering in that tangled,
Tortured wood,
That some call “childhood”,
Alone;
And took me by the hand.
Silently,
Unknown,
You led me through mazèd paths
Where doubt,
With terrifying greenness,
Strives to choke out
Paler petals of the beautiful;
Still on,
Through burr-filled crevices of the mind.
Until now, at last, I find
We stand upon the hill;
And there is light.
Below,
The plain,
Terraced with the struggle of all men;
The rushing river comes
To sweep another from the hill again.
You must turn back now,
Guardian of the Wood;
And I must run behind the plow
That furrows youth’s rich land.
I drop your hand,—
And am alone again.
Yet I shall not be lonely,
Though on the mountain range of age
Should I be exiled;
For Memory shall whisper sweet
That once within the wood you took my hand,
And smiled.
