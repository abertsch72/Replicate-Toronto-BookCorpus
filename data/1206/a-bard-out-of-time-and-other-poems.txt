About the Author
A Bard Out of Time
Part 1
Once while I was in Dun Keep,
a brothel did I pass,
and I wondered if the price were cheap
to get a piece of —
The hill had moved beneath his feet,
staggering his words,
but he regained his steady beat
through the grassy sward.
I walked in through the brothel door
in search of a comely lass,
but found, instead, a troublesome whore
with chains of iron and whips of brass.
I tried to run, I tried to hide,
but I could not get away —
His voice was broken in mid-stride
as both feet slipped away;
About his knees, like ropy claws,
were two thin, thorny vines
with flowers budding toothy jaws
up and down their lines;
They squeezed and pulled with all their might
to fell his bardic stance,
but instinct brought his sword to strike
a whirling dervish dance!
The vines had twisted round and round;
His sword was twirling death;
The flowers, tufts of reddish-brown
with floral scented breath,
had tiny teeth that gnawed his skin
with hunger’s taste unleashed,
until his sword untangled them
from his tunic sleeve;
His fingers burned from tiny snags,
but soon his legs were free
from the tattered, severed rags
of deadly snarlweed.
When the thrashing settled down,
the vines were all but gone;
He shrugged and turned to move away
as if no war was won;
A moment passed for him to catch
the strangled breath he’d lost,
and when he found his voice again,
he resumed his raucous song:
I tried to run, I tried to hide,
but I could not get away;
That she-devil of a twisted whore,
she chased me all the way!
Up the stair and through a door
and out the window I fled;
On the roof I found myself 
with a fate far worse than death!
She cackled out in playful notes
between her broken teeth;
“I give to you the thing you want!
I give it to you free!”
The roof was far too small for two
despite its length and breadth—
Oh! but for the will to jump
and plunge myself to death!
Alas, my love for life’s too strong
to give it up so soon;
I should have understood the signs,
but I was thrice a fool!
She stalked me like some kind of prey;
Her cackles filled the air;
The stinging cracks of leather whip—
Chain links everywhere—
She blocked me in and closed the gap;
Her poundage flexed to pounce;
She must have weighed three hundred pounds
if she weighed an ounce!
The rooftop creaked and buckled
with every step she took,
and then a rafter snapped in two
and sent her through the roof;
I was too startled by the sight
to move to stop her fall,
and listened as her bovine screams
echoed off the walls.
I could have helped to save her life,
but I was more concerned
with fleeing from that dreadful place
of such sadistic charm!
Something deep inside me said
that she was still alive,
and so I scampered down the wall
and fled into the night.
The hills had turned to forest
as he finished up his song;
His brother’s inn was getting close—
it wouldn’t be too long
before a night of revelry,
of good food, wine, and friends;
His heart was lifting with his mood
to meet the journey’s end.
He came upon the twisting road
that led to Shallow Dale,
but could not see the faces of
the shadows that he felt.
A cackle rumbled through the air,
and chills went down his spine.
He heard the clank of brassy chains;
A woman cried: “You’re mine!”
He felt the skin upon his neck
creeping down his spine;
He heard the stomping of her feet
pounding through his mind;
The fear he felt was much the same
as when they first had met;
She was a whore of ample size
that he would not forget.
Then laughter rumbled impishly;
A youthful man emerged;
The look upon his boyish face
was all the man deserved!
The startled bard brandished fists
and chased him down the road;
He cursed him for a devil’s brat
with every breath and word.
They ran around until at last
the anger eased away,
and then he hugged his brother’s son,
forgiving him his play.
“Your magic’s getting better, son;
I never would have guessed
that your illusion was the cause
of such a wondrous jest!”
“Uncle, I could not resist;
Your voice was raised in song;
A simple spell is all I cast,
but it was all in fun!”
They walked along, side by side,
into the village square;
They found the Inn of Scarlet Wine
and ordered up some beer.
His travels had been weary ones;
His heart was full of cheer;
The bard was taken to his room
and soon retired there.
He hid the gold that he had won
and left his sword and shield;
He locked the room with special care
as he rehearsed his spiel.
He strolled into the common room
with purpose in his stride;
He carried in his tender arms
his one and only pride.
The villagers had gathered round;
Their voices filled the room;
They knew the minstrel had arrived
and revelry would come!
A place was made for him to sit;
The wine was freely poured;
The villagers awaited him:
They knew this gifted bard.
The minstrel tuned his trusty harp,
and expectations rose;
As quiet filled the common room,
he struck his singing pose;
He cleared his throat with dignity;
He took a gulp of wine;
He saw in every single face
that they were his this night.
My friends, I fear my heart grows old;
My spirit cold and bleak;
For I beheld a dreadful woe
upon a village street;
A bard had come to sing some songs—
or so it seemed to us—
I went to listen with the throng,
since I was curious;
Would her lutist skill be strong?
Would her voice be fair?
Would she want to trade her songs?
Would I even care?
Her technique was quite unique
and drew my interest in;
I listened with the villagers
and this is what she did:
Her horse’s hooves were used like clubs
to pound a steady beat,
and when the rhythm had been set,
she began to speak:
“I bid to thee a wondrous day
and offer thee my croon.”
Her voice held music in its depths
that nearly made me swoon.
“The songs I play will have no name,
and mine must not be told;
So gather round, gather round,
and see what may unfold!”
The rhythm of the horse’s hooves
against the wooden block
sent a message through the square
to those she hadn’t caught;
It was the only sound to hear
until she strummed her lute;
Its chords were plucked with striking ease
that slowly built at tune.
The mournful lilt was obvious
to all the common folk,
and soon we heard her gentle voice
as she began to talk:
“This song I sing in memory
of one I dearly loved,
who lost his life while battling
the dragon Astranov.
“He was a friend of many men
who wore the warrior’s clothes;
His heart was pure as fresh-lain snow;
His sword was sharply honed.
“He’d heard a tale of misery,
of famine, fear, and death
and followed rumors to a mill
along a river’s edge.
“The miller’s girl was still alive;
No one else was there;
She would have fled, if she could,
if there had been somewhere —
“But where? Where? Where to go?
The village was her home!
She’d never left the miller’s creek—
There was nowhere to go!
“I will not tell the tale she told
that warrior fair and strong;
But I was there beside him when
he vowed what would be done!
“‘The dragon Astranov will die!’
he swore upon his sword,
and off he went to find the beast,
for that miller’s girl!
“He surveyed all the countryside
and found no living soul;
The villagers were surely dead—
all but the miller’s girl;
“She was, it seemed, the only one,
and he could not believe
the story of her hiding out
where dragon’s cannot see;
“He’d heard a dragon’s sense of smell
was keener than a sword;
So how could it have missed the girl
beneath the flooring board?
“He questioned her until she cried,
then cursed his callous heart;
He had suspicions that she’d lied,
but how and where to start?
“He tried to ease her suffering,
but she was far too proud;
She let him have an upstairs room
while she slept on the ground.
“But when the morning sun arose
and he came down the steps,
there was no miller’s girl around—
Through the door he crept;
“He found her by the river’s edge,
watching water pass;
She heard him moving up on her
and whirled round too fast.
“An evil gleam was in her eye;
a short sword in her grip;
A feral snarl issued forth
snaking past her lips.
“She lashed out with deceptive speed
and nearly ran him through;
But he had managed to avoid
being cleft in two.
“Her second thrust —such maddened force! —
was met with trusty steel;
His sword was knocked loose from his hands,
but he refused to yield!
“The young girl’s eyes were changing now
into a reddish glow;
She dropped her sword with fiendish glee
as she began to grow.
“Her skin was tinted brimstone red;
Her scales were breaking free;
Her tail was stretching out of sight;
Her legs were thick as trees;
“Her claws and fangs were sharply honed;
Her tongue was sharply set:
‘Oh warrior friend, I must admit,
my appetite is whet!
“‘This village wasn’t quite enough
to fill my hungry need,
and now you’ve brought to me dessert!
A tasty little treat!’
“The warrior ran like any man
when dragons look at them,
and while he fled into the hills,
there followed this refrain:
‘I be a dragon big and strong,
I eat little people all day long,
I roast ‘em, and I toast ‘em,
and I throw ‘em in a bowl;
I munch ‘em, and I crunch ‘em,
and I swallow ‘em whole!’
“His fear-filled flight was much too slow
to get him from his plight;
Soon the dragon scooped him up
and gently took a bite;
“Then with a playful toss or two,
the dragon chuckled deep:
‘This morsel is a healthy one,
a healthy one, indeed!’
“Now, you may wonder why I chose
to sing this dreadful tale;
I thought I’d set the atmosphere
before my dinner bell!”
When her song had met its end,
a strange thing then occurred:
Horse and woman rearranged
into a dragon pair!
I stood transfixed in fear and awe
while they began to feast;
Then something broke that dragon’s spell
and freed me from the beasts;
I won’t deny my coward’s act —
I am no match for dragons —
And so I fled the village square
and hid behind some wagons.
There was nothing I could do
to stop the village slaughter,
but when the dragons finished up,
I chose to follow after.
They did not leave the village square
while still in dragon shape;
They shifted back to human form,
and I made my escape;
They walked with deep contentedness —
their paunches stretching wide —
But when I strummed my trusty harp,
they stopped cold in their stride.
They spun around with blinding speed,
but I was out of sight;
I’d hidden in an alcove’s shade
and held my harp-strings tight;
They muttered hisses to themselves,
then turned back in disgust;
I mouthed a silent heart-felt prayer
to that bastard Onus!
My voice rang out in robust tones;
my harp brought forth a tune;
I sang a verse of dragon’s might
and all of mankind’s doom;
I hoped my guess would serve me well
and life would still go on;
While the dragons listened in,
I played a soothing song.
I eased the tension with my song
and drew them in my spell,
but just before I finished it,
I told them I might sell;
It would cost them just two things:
my freedom and their song;
The hatred boiled in their eyes:
I knew I wasn’t wrong.
She spat an oath and then agreed
and gave her dragon’s word;
Then I sang the final verse
and played the final chord.
They left me standing with my life
and with the song they sang
of how the dragon Astranov
achieved her fearful fame.
I’ve sung that song a hundred times
in many village squares,
to warn them of an unnamed bard
who rides a coal-black mare.
It was the most that I could do—
despite the tragedy—
I am a bard, a lowly bard,
not a hero, me!”
Absently, he strummed his harp strings
egging on the boisterous crowd;
Someone brought another flagon,
and he slurped its contents down.
While he pondered what to sing next,
someone in the crowd spoke up:
“No more songs of death and ruin!
A song of love is what we want!”
As they settled into place,
their mugs were full once more,
he said to them: Apologies,
my friend: I can’t ignore
This solemn duty that I have;
The people must be warned!
But now it’s done, and I will be
a bawdy troubadour!
He considered for a moment,
then began to strum his harp;
It was such a rapid tempo,
that he had them from the start.
I was lucky to be present
when the maiden Charity
was abducted by an ogre
who professed his love for she;
He had brought a gift of treasure,
one he thought she would adore,
but when she saw the rotting wolf skin,
she just threw it on the floor!
When he howled his deep affection,
she turned pale as ghosts would be;
Then she fainted from the horror
as he stood dumbfoundedly.
Then a thought went passing through him —
We know how rare that that can be!
He reached down to lift the maiden—
He took away poor Charity!
He was not the brightest ogre
that I’ve ever come to know,
and so he never even noticed
when I followed out the door.
The ogre went into the forest,
down a trail and to the left;
On his shoulder was the maiden
that he wanted for his wife;
I made sure he didn’t see me,
but, in time, I lost their trail;
When I finally found his haven,
I tried to save her from that hell!
His cave was cut into the hillside,
its roof of solid stone;
To the ogre, it was heaven,
to the ogre, it was home;
When I heard the maiden screaming,
I was sure she was afraid,
until the ogre dropped his loin cloth—
then she fainted dead away!
What they did I will not tell you,
but the noises that they made!
I guess the maiden changed her standards—
Then the ogre went away!
She just lay in utter rapture
with no thought of her escape,
and when I offered to assist her,
she just said to go away!
I went back into the village,
unsure of her sanity,
and told the people of the ogre
and the maiden Charity.
They just chuckled at my stupor,
then they told me of the tale
of how the maiden threw some silver
in a magic wishing well!
All she wanted was a lover
unlike all the men she’d had;
What came after was the ogre,
and at first, she thought him mad!
In the days that quickly followed,
she fell deeply into love,
and once a month they still repeat it
when the full moon hangs above.
We just hang our heads in sorrow
for the men who have no wives,
for none among them can compare
to the ogre’s ten-and-five!
Raucous laughter rumbled from them
as he listened with a grin;
When their comments eased to silence,
to a chuckle now-and-them,
he still sat there softly strumming,
waiting for the proper time;
When he felt them growing restless,
he prepared his favorite rhyme:
This song I purchased from a man
with hair of silver-gray;
He’s sold me many others, too,
since that fateful day.
I traded in my innocence
and blind naiveté;
He taught me all about the world
with every song he sang.
He was my mentor for a time,
and this was once his harp;
He showed me how to find the words
and when and where to start;
He taught me how to build a tune
and play these tangled strains,
but I have never been so moved
as by his first refrains.
The music that he chose to play
was dark and glumly strung,
and as he set the morose mood,
this is what he sung:
“My aching head was weary and
my thoughts were all but clear;
A wretched scent assaulted me
from dungeon cells too near;
“The smell was too familiar;
I knew from whence it came:
A putrid thing of terror:
A troll as known by name.
“I moved away as best I could
from that noxious stench;
It smelled too much like rotten wood,
decaying fish, and death.
“I huddled in a corner’s cramp
and looked about my cell,
and from the light of yonder lamp,
there wasn’t much to tell.
“The cell was damp and musty
with rug of matted straw;
The window’s bars were dusty—
I heard the troll guffaw!
“There came a massive scraping sound
from the cell next door to mine,
and then a claw came creeping round
to see what it could find!
“It patted round a moment, but
before it turned away,
laughter filled the dungeon’s hall
like sickened donkeys’ bray;
“A chill that wasn’t made from cold
splintered through my spine;
An image too intense to hold
went jumping through my mind;
‘Come, my little human friend,
I find I need some food;
I promise you an easy end,
if you promise to be good!’
“I never knew a troll before
and did not know they spoke,
So I was unprepared, for sure,
when the silence broke.
“Just as I would answer him,
a new sound came to bear:
The sound of footfalls coming down
the musty dungeon stair.
“A moment later came the source,
and shudders ran me through;
It was a person of great force,
without a doubt, I knew.
‘Welcome to my humble home,
my friend from years gone by;
You know by now you’re not alone,
and now I’ll tell you why:
‘A troll is quite uniquely made
and very hard to kill;
Its severed hand or sharpened claw
regenerates until
‘it is another troll
with all its skills intact;
Together with its mother-troll,
the twain make their attack.
‘But what of you, you ask of me?
Where do you fit in?
The troll’s my tool for treachery,
and soon, revenge begins.
‘You see, a troll has fingers,
and each one can be cut,
and like the wrath that lingers
in the bottom of my gut,
‘They feed on seeming nothingness,
getting stronger every day;
Their hunger’s pull is endless;
It never goes away.’ 
“I watched his smile slipping down
as he looked in my cell
concentrating on the words
for casting off the spell;
 “When he finished chanting,
there was one thing I knew:
No matter what he asked of me,
I would surely do!
“His smile came back once again
as he unsheathed his sword;
The troll held out its hand to him
as servant to his lord.
“One finger from the troll was cut—
It wriggled round and round—
He turned to me and held it out—
I made squawking sounds.
‘Here you go, my long-time friend;
Your dinner has been served.
Not the most pleasant one,
but no less than you deserve!’
“I tried to fight the spell’s control
but could not break its hold;
I took the finger of the troll
and swallowed it, whole.”
He played the final, haunting notes
as if his harp had died;
Then let their echo fill the room—
a weepy, ghostly sigh.
He paused and said in whispered tones
to make them strain to hear;
“I asked him if his song was true
and met his sternest glare;
“If it is true, I ask of you,
then why are you not dead?”
“I’ll tell you why I did not die,”
but that was all he said.
His subtlety was very good,
as single notes were played;
He struck them almost carelessly,
as though his fingers strayed;
Soon his notes grew into song,
with peaceful melody,
and in a solemn, vibrant voice,
he sang this song to me:
“Two days of terror came to pass,
the troll in me unbound,
and I became a writhing mass
of twisted, anguished sound;
“It felt as though my world would end
before the troll emerged;
That burning, churning, tightening
I could not seem to purge;
“Not a moment passed me by
my belly didn’t burn;
Nor could I ignore the way
the finger ever-turned!
“I felt it twitch and seem to grow—
Was it now a hand?
My doom had come to take away
a haunted, tortured man.
“And then his footfalls echoed down
the dungeon stair so near;
His laughter settled on the ground
with trilling, chilling cheer.
“He’d been there several times before,
to ask if I was well;
He’d watch me writhing on the floor—
It wasn’t hard to tell—
“I’d grind my teeth and glare at him—
His smile ever grew—
If I were free, I’d be killing him—
This, I’m sure, he knew—
“But this time it was different
from all the other times;
‘My friend,’ he said, with some regret,
‘I think it may be time
‘for you to know the truth of trolls
and how they can be killed.
A flaming torch will burn up trolls,
and acid always will;
‘The acid works at greater speed
to burn the troll away;
What’s in your stomach’s all you need
to eat a troll a day!’
“His eyes held no compassion-
all there was was glee;
He saw by my reaction
that I could not believe:
“If what he said was really true,
then why was I in pain?
I felt the twisting finger, too,
moving round again!
‘I see you don’t believe my words;
It’s all the same to me;
But I believe in just rewards
for what you did to me.
‘It wasn’t long before I found
a cure for what was done—
For two long days I wandered ‘round
before I found the one
‘whose skill was truly evident;
He stopped that dreadful spell;
But every hour I had spent,
I cursed you thrice to hell!
‘So, when I was myself again,
I started making plans;
I finally came across the means
to make good my revenge.
‘The troll was not expecting
all the power that I wield,
and so it was quite easy
to make the creature yield;
‘It wasn’t long before I saw
the poetic artistry
of tricking you with the troll
and letting you believe
‘that it could grow inside of you—
although it never could—
It’s hunger pains that trouble you,
and I’ve brought you some food!
‘Now the time has come at last,
when I have seen it through:
I’ll give to you your last repast
before I run you through!”
“With these words, he had produced
a meal extraordinaire;
There was no way I could refuse;
I ate with rabid flair.
“The pain inside my stomach fled,
and soon I ate no more;
The prospect that I’d soon be dead
came rushing to the fore—
“You don’t spend time in dungeons
without some time to think;
They haven’t kept me in one long
before I’ve broken free.
“Every thief I’ve ever known
has a secret place
where he keeps his favorite tools
handy, just in case;
“Though my clothes and boots were gone,
my body still was there;
A pick was woven in among
my twisted locks of hair;
“It took some time to dig it out
and pick that dungeon lock,
but when I finally worked it out,
away from there I got!
“Escaping was not very hard—
He did not think I could—
Once I was beyond the yard,
I scurried through the wood
“‘until at last I came to rest
inside these hallowed walls;
I do not know what might be next—
but that’s another song!
When he finished with his ballad,
and his tale had been unfurled,
I regarded him with wonder,
and my thoughts began to whirr;
I could sense a deeper meaning
in the rhythm of his song;
There was something that was missing,
something else that should belong;
I considered for a moment
on the ballad he had sung;
then it struck me like a bad note:
What was it he might have done?
What had brought on such desire
for revenge from such a man?
I posed this question to my mentor:
How was it that this began?
I remember his sly smile
and the gentle nod he gave,
then he started playing somber,
wretched notes that screamed in pain;
These he teased to softer texture
where his voice crept in between;
Here’s the ballad I procured by
 asking him to please explain:
“I huddled in among the trees
outside the castle walls,
a creeping, shadowed mystery
with feather-soft footfalls;
“The lamplight of the passing guard
was lost inside the fog;
I crept forward, softly forward
from tree to fallen log;
“When the light had finally past
without a warning call,
I hurried through the fresh-cut grass
and up against the wall;
“It was just as I remembered—
brick and mortar, creeping vine,
tiny fissures for my fingers,
perfect toeholds I could climb.
“My breath was taken in with caution,
I climbed into the night;
The guards made no abrupt commotion;
Everything still seemed all right.
“I made it to the battlement;
The guards were chattering;
I landed with a muffled thud
without them noticing.
“I hurried ‘cross the catwalk
to the inner wall
and fastened on my grapple hook
and set the rope to fall.
“‘I vaulted quickly over
and hung on to the rope
and listened to their laughter
as they shared a private joke.
“The grapple slipped a little,
grating on the stone;
I slid down from its middle,
dropped down to the ground;
“That’s when they must have heard me—
They began to shout;
Alarm bells started banging,
and guard dogs were let out.
“I sprinted ‘cross the courtyard
and found a place to hide;
It wasn’t long before the guards
had caught me in their sights.
“I stood there for a moment;
They leveled their crossbows;
I sprinted for the castle wall
as they released their bolts.
“I heard the clang and clutter,
the clamor of their shouts;
I scampered up a ladder,
hoping to get out.
“I saw the feet above me
as I topped the castle wall;
The guards were waiting for me:
My best bet was to fall.
“I let go of the ladder
and landed in a roll;
I heard the guardsmen banter
as they readied their crossbows.
“It isn’t very hard to know
when running isn’t wise;
When you are ringed by crossbow bolts
and one is in your thigh;
“I did the only thing I could:
I screamed with all my might:
“Mercy! Quarter! Hold your swords!
I beg you, spare my life!”
“The scraping of the guardsmen’s feet
as they gathered round
echoed with finality
through the courtyard grounds.
“Someone struck me on the head,
and all the world turned black;
I would have thought that I had died,
except one brutal fact:
“My hands were held behind me;
My thigh was screaming pain;
A stranger stood before me,
and he was not my friend.
‘I see you now are waking,
and I hope that you are well;
I have some pointed questions
whose answers you will tell.
‘But first I must relieve you
of all your weaponry—
The picks inside your boots,
wherever they may be.”
“He searched me with a master’s skill
and nearly found it all;
A single thing was hid too well
that I will soon recall.
“He asked me what I wanted;
What was worth the risk?
I told him it was nothing:
just a magic disc.
“The disc, I’d heard, was mighty,
one that I could sell;
It would fetch a handsome price,
and I would make out well.
‘There are no magic discs in here,
in this sacred keep;
I sentence you to spend a year
in the mines that run beneath;
‘And when that year is over,
you will be set free—
Unless you die, of course!”
He laughed maliciously.
“He left me in my dungeon cell
to think on what he’d said;
My future didn’t bode too well,
but better that than dead!
“I scratched an itch behind my ear
and brushed my collar’s lip;
Both were still sequestered there,
the garrote and the pick.
“It’s not that I’d forgotten—
I was still in shock—
The blow had nearly broke my skull 
and rattled all my thoughts!
“So when the guard had turned away
and I was given time,
I searched until I found the string
that freed the garrote’s line.
“From there, it wasn’t hard to do,
once I took the pick
and turned all my attention to
the lock that needed picked.
“The lock was quite a fancy one,
with many little tricks,
but I am skilled and had them sprung
within a few minutes.
“The door slid open noisily
as rusty hinges flaked;
The guard came running hastily—
but just a bit too late.
“The garrote slipped about his throat
and tightened ‘til he bled;
I kept the pressure up until
I knew that he was dead.
“Then I gathered up my gear
from a table in the hall,
put my boots back on my feet,
and leaned against the wall.
“I rested there a moment,
made sure it was still there:
The vial—most important—
was still sequestered where
“The seam between the sole and heel
were glued with surest hand,
along with the instructions
that my employer planned.
“I hurried up the dungeon stair
and followed narrow paths
until I found the bed chamber
marked upon my map.
“This was where His Lordship slept,
alone or with his wife,
and this is where I softly crept—
but not to take his life.
“I do not kill for profit,
nor do I think it’s fun,
but deep, deep down, I do believe
at times it must be done.
“I regret the guardsman’s death,
but did not have a choice;
I had to get up to the lord
with very little noise.
“I heard his quiet whispers
to the woman in his bed,
and eased a little closer,
until I saw his head.
“He wasn’t wearing armor—
or any other clothes—
The vial was unstoppered,
ready to be thrown.
“The liquid in the vial,
with sureness of my aim,
struck the lord and lady,
and they began to change.
“The liquid oozed and bubbled,
mingled with their screams;
I fled in fear of trouble—
as well as other things.
“I hid out in an alcove
as the guardsmen hurried past,
I scampered through the shadows,
upward, ‘til at last
“I found myself upon the roof.
Moving with great care,
I found the grapple, rope, and hook
that I had hidden there;
“It wasn’t very hard to do,
to thread the grapple line
and hook it to the battlement
and leave that place behind.
“But I had carried out with me
the sight I had beheld,
the twisting of their living flesh
into a molten shell.
“The plan had been successful,
from beginning to the end;
Let them think I was inept
by getting caught, and then—
“They wouldn’t guard me very well,
and I would be inside
to send the lord into a hell
that he could not abide!
“Escaping had been easy—
Chaos had ensued—
I was free, if queasy,
lost within the wood.
“I hurried through those wooded hills
and found my trusty steed;
I made it to the sacred shrine
of Onus, God of Thieves.
“There is where I rested
while my thigh-wound healed,
then back to stealing trinkets—
let other people kill!
“Although he never died that day,
I never will forget
the screaming of the pair of them
writhing in that bed.
“Her face was all in motion;
his was twisting skin;
A scalding transformation
had started to set in;
“Their faces were no longer
human shape or form;
The visage of the monsters 
was starting to reform;
“The sight that was emerging
was pure grotesquery:
Their hair and teeth were growing
lycanthropically!
“Their screams turned into howling;
Two wolves had come to bear!
In seconds, it was over:
I was out of there.
“My life has changed dramatically
from that moment on;
I’ve chosen much more carefully
all the jobs that I have done.
“So far as I can say, it’s true,
in almost every way—
until I suddenly awoke
in that dungeon, on that day.”
I was certain it was over
but found I was in err;
In the silence struck so simple
came more notes of somber flair.
As I listened to the music,
came a sadness to my soul;
Deep, resounding, oh-so-tragic
was the music’s gentle pull.
Then with quiet, intoned whisper
that filled up the silent hall;
The tragic tale my mentor sang me
I will now replay in full;
“I had heard a lonely growling,
just beyond the sacred shrine—
A far-off, doleful, plaintiff howling
through the hills of knotted pine;
“It all started on that evening
when the full moon came to light;
A deep, resentful, soulful moaning
echoed through the deepest night;
“Weeks went by, and still this howling
filled the eerie countryside;
Then I saw it in the meadow:
a female werewolf in midstride.
“She was not a lone wolf maiden:
there beside her was a man
who gripped her collar, firmly, certain,
with a lover’s gentle hand.
“When he saw me standing there,
a wicked grin emerged;
‘We meet again, my nemesis—
The last time, to be sure!’
“As he stroked the shaggy collar
of the werewolf’s matted fur,
She responded with the slavered
tongue, like a delighted cur;
“He nudged her gently forward;
First she quivered, then she leapt;
‘Easy love, there is no hurry;
Our vengeance will be sweet!’
“She shivered as he chuckled;
Then he turned to me:
‘Your death will be forthcoming,
full of misery;
‘It will not happen suddenly,
nor will it be by pain;
But suffering you will endure;
You’ll beg to have it end!
‘There is but one cure to be found;
It doesn’t always work;
I will not tell you what it is,
and neither will the wolf!’
“He smiled with an earnestness
that I could not displace
and whispered something to the were
and she jumped for my face.
“I tried to dodge her beastly jaws—
She twisted in the air—
She scratched me with extended claws
and left me crouching there.
“Her tail wagged harshly back and forth—
Her yipping was extreme—
She left me crouching fearfully
as though it were a dream!
“The wound was almost nothing
but must have been enough;
The female were was satisfied
and softly padded off.
“She rubbed her side against the man;
He stroked her furry chin;
She started howling as she changed
to human form again.
“There she stood in naked flesh,
a smile on her face;
He took the cloak about his neck
and wrapped it round her waist.
“Then he turned to bow at me
and bade me ill farewell:
‘Now you’ll be a bit like her,
inside a twisted hell!’
“I did not understand his words
until the next full moon,
when spasms ripped apart my form
and left me in a swoon.
“I woke beneath the morning sun,
naked, cold, and dazed;
I did not know what I had done
for many, many days.
“It wasn’t ‘til the fourth full moon
that I became aware
that I was changing to a wolf;
I had become a were!”
Here, his music wavered,
recalling ancient pain;
Then it picked up pace again:
a simple, light refrain.
“Lycanthropy, lycanthropy,
what a change you’ve made in me:
“My hair has grown so rapidly;
My wounds heal much more readily;
“And now my heart has broken through
from this most sadistic cue:
“When the moon is full, I start
changing to a wolf-in-part,
“but no silver do I have
to make arrow, blade, or shaft;
“And so I live as half-a-man
until the moon is full again,
“and then the wolfish fangs will sprout,
to rip and rend and shred and gouge;
“The taste of blood, the taste of flesh—
my appetite is quickly whet—
“The screams of fear, the screams of pain,
drive me down a frenzied chain;
“One by one, they slake my thirst
until I very nearly burst,
“and then the sun begins to rise,
blinding me—my human eyes—
“The tears well up in agony—
I’ve survived again, you see—
“and all I really want from life
is an end to all this strife.
The playfulness within his tone
was quickly set aside;
A somber melody began,
as if his harp has died:
“Six long months would slowly pass
before I gained control
of the sickness I possessed,
the part that was a wolf.
“The urges came at awkward times
when fear or anger rose,
and every full moon I would find
the wolf in me exposed.
“The hair and claws come bursting out
with painful little pricks;
From deep within, a feral shout
upsurges to my lips—
“It erupts as strangled howl
that I cannot control;
A soulful, mournful, tragic howl
to match my tortured soul!
“The first time that it happened,
it caught me by surprise;
I’d haggled with a merchant prince
for a better price;
“He would not budge a copper coin,
and I refused to pay;
Frustration passed beyond the point
that held my wolf at bay.
“Cries of fear—The summoned guard—
My instinct to survive—
The merchant’s wail—The guardsman’s sword—
My need to stay alive—
“The taste of blood—The raging howl—
Singes from a torch’s flame—
The scrambled flight—The midnight prowl—
Daylight bringing change—
“Impressions, only, of that night—
my world had come unwound—
Enough to send me into flight
far from that hapless town!
“I somehow found my tangled way
back to the temple grounds;
The priests held little sympathy:
They unleashed the hounds.
“They came at me with viciousness,
but once they caught a whiff
of the wolf-blood in my veins,
they came up short and stiff;
“They whimpered with their tails hung low,
their noses to the ground,
The High Priest said, ‘We had to know.’ 
and whistled for the hounds.
“They looked at him, then back at me,
 before they went inside.
I waited half-expectantly
to be rebuffed. Instead:
“The High Priest told me of a tale
about the werewolf’s curse;
It started with a wishing well
and Old Demonicus.
“He was a wizard of great skill
and greater devilry;
He didn’t want to end up killed
by normal weaponry;
“And so he made an evil pact
and Onus made him pay;
For every contract He transacts,
He does it His own way.
“For a normal weapon’s strike to fail
to cause him mortal wounds,
he had to feel the bitter pain
and change into a wolf.
“Onus laughed, spat in his eyes,
and left him lying there;
The wizard cursed Old Onus’ Bones
for making him a were.
“He spent his lifetime searching for
any kind of cure,
and found a perverse pleasure
in creating other were.
“He died one night in solitude,
beneath the full moon’s gaze,
A silver dagger ran him through—
That’s what the High Priest said.
“Now that I have had some time
to come to understand,
I’ve drawn the stark conclusion that
I’m now more wolf than man!”
 He eyed me with an intense look
that shook me to the core,
and then he smiled whimsically
and struck a gnarled chord.
“The wolves are howling to the moon,
not far beyond that door;
I sense their presence in this room,
the breeze upon their fur;
 “I smell the scent of stale dog breath,
and feel their thirst for blood;
I hear their pad-falls bringing death,
and taste their slavered tongue;
 “Do you hear the fear of the hart?
The panic in its haggard breath?
They know they have that poor deer trapped;
It smells impending death.
“The hunt is calling to my wolf;
It’s restless and wants out;
The pack—my pack—prepares to kill—
Let’s have another draught!”
The sudden shift enveloped me;
The barmaid brought the ale;
I paid. We drank. He laughed at me 
and then resumed his tale.
“Years have passed, and still I dread
the coming of the moon
The little tingle in my head,
reminds me of my doom;
“The only thing that’s kept me sane
through all these tortured years
is my pack. They are my friends,
and soon they will be yours!”
Here he paused amid his song
and let the music fade;
The silence lingered oh-so-long
before he turned to say,
“The High Priest had refused to me
the right of every thief:
The right of sanctuary
in their time of need.
“The temple doors were firmly set;
the windows closed and locked;
The guards were armed with silver bolts;
Their crossbows all were cocked;
“I took the hint and made my way
along a troubled stream,
and when the full moon showed its face,
I responded with a scream.…
“In the morning when I woke,
I was not alone;
I had been joined by a wolf—
a young, gray, female one.
“She was the first of many;
She is the best of all;
She leads them on their hunt tonight—
There’s triumph in her howl—”
He shuddered as in ecstasy;
His fingers stilled the strings;
His nostrils flared; he licked his lips;
And then he looked at me.
“She calls for me, a plaintive wail,
but I must stay away;
I found a wizard with a spell
to keep my wolf at bay.
“You see, there is a tragic twist
in this sordid tale;
The curse I bear is not the worst;
There is a worse one still. 
“The first full moon that came to pass
when I remained a man,
I went into the woods in case
the wizard failed, and—
Until this point, his voice had been
in perfect pitch and tone,
but now it wavered with the strain
and crumbled to a groan.
“She was there, that lovely gray,
that beauty of a wolf,
to see me through that wretched change
that we have spoken of—
“But when the full moon topped the trees,
I remained a man;
I felt the wolfish urgency
but not the sudden change!
“The gray was writhing on the ground—
She yipped from intense pain;
Her fur retracted—limbs extended—
She cried out yet again—
“A human wail escaped her lips;
her eyes were full of fear;
She tried to run, but only tripped,
as I called out to her.
“She quivered in a huddled mass;
I sang a soothing tune;
I sang and sang until at last
the setting of the moon.
“She never spoke a single word
that long and dreadful night,
and with the coming of the morn,
she began to writhe;
“She shifted back into the wolf
and fled from me that day;
On nights like this—successful hunts—
she pines the night away.
“Her woeful howls are for my wolf,
the one the spell obscures,
and when the moon is bright and full,
and she’s in human form,
“We find a dark secluded glen
and share a night of love;
A blissful night but once a month
is all we’ll ever have.
“Her curse, you see, was but my own,
reversed and thrust on her;
The wizard’s spell had gone all wrong;
the price was paid by her.
“The cost of being free again
was far too high to pay;
I had to hunt that lordling down:
I had to make him pay!
“I saw his castle hadn’t changed
when I approached the gates;
The only thing that made it strange
was my accursed fate;
“I did not try to sneak inside;
His wrath had been assuaged—
or so I thought. I did not hide—
a very big mistake!
“He recognized me at first sight
and called upon his guards
to put me in their crossbow sights
before I’d said a word.
“I tried to dodge the crossbow bolts,
but several found a home;
I bear the scars in chest and thigh,
and by this severed thumb.”
He paused his strumming for effect
and showed me it was true—
It ended at the knuckle joint—
and then his play resumed;
He struck a solemn, tragic note
that hung like broken limb
dangling from shredded bark
in chilling, heavy wind.
“I lost my wits and fell in faint
from blood-loss and from pain,
and when I woke to blurry thoughts,
I had been caught again.”
Here he paused to take a breath
and let his song unfurl;
Ominous resounding notes
that caused my hair to curl.
His voice was firm and deeply set;
His words were chosen well;
His song was filled up by the soul
of what he must have felt.
“I was hanging by some shackles
in that dungeon of discord,
praying by the minute
in the hopes that Onus heard;
“The God of Thieves had mercy,
and He heard my fearful plea;
I pulled with all my meager strength;
The shackle chains broke free!
“I was shocked into inaction
and fell flat on the floor;
The taste of rot and mildew,
I’d often known before.
“It wasn’t quite so bad this time,
and soon I found my poise;
I shuffled round the dungeon cell,
barely making noise.
“My fingers sifted through the muck
with diligence and care,
until, at last, I found the thing
I’d hoped would be in there;
“The sliver of a broken bone
was more than I dared ask,
and with a patient, tender touch,
I bent down to the task.
“It wasn’t like a metal pick,
but I could not complain;
The shackles fell like burdens lost—
my hands were free again!
“I next turned my attention to
the lock within the door;
The shard of bone just snapped in two
and crumpled to the floor.
“I stood there for a moment
with my eyes and mouth agape;
I cursed the God of Mischief twice
for such a twist of fate!
“I heard some muffled laughter
in my twisted frame of mind,
and realized with a staggered thought
that all of it was mine!
“It brought me to my senses
in a way I can’t explain;
I dropped down quickly to my knees
and searched the floor again.
“I’d been locked up for far too long—
my mind was bound to break—
I had to free myself from there
before it was too late.
“Despite the efforts that I made,
the best that I could do
was find more bits of broken bone
that quickly snapped in two.
“I finally gave up trying
and sought another way;
Perhaps I could deceive the guard
when next he came my way?
“When next I heard him coming,
I was back against the wall;
I held the shackles loosely;
He made his warning call;
“The key turned slowly with a clank;
The cell door opened up;
The guardsman entered with a limp
and brought a water cup.
“His eyes were cruel and vicious
as he poured it on the ground;
I smiled with a vengeful gleam—
The shackle chains came down.
“They struck him just a glancing blow,
but as he turned to run,
I wrapped them round his pudgy neck
and pulled that guardsman down.
“I badly felt the urge to kill,
but something stayed my hand;
Despite the cruelties he had done,
he was still a man.
“I stood there for a moment more,
then left him in the cell;
I used his keys to lock the door
and took the water pail.
“I knew the best way to succeed
would be to leave at once,
but, first, I prayed in gratitude
for guidance from Onus.
“He must have listened to my words—
and more, he must have cared!
For when I reached the catacombs,
I knew my way from there!
“Perhaps it was by chance alone
or traces in the dust?
But when I reached the outer end,
I prayed to Great Onus:
“If you free me from this place,
I swear my soul is yours!
I’ll steal whatever you may want
and leave it at your door!
“I felt a searing as of flame
that burned into my mind,
and in its wake it left a map
of masterful design;
“A single phrase was uttered then,
that only I could hear:
Seek The Temple of Chagrin,
and all will be made clear.
“Whirlwinds made of dust and air
erupted all around;
They circled in with blinding speed
and raised me off the ground!
“The next thing that I noticed
was the next thing that I saw:
I was standing at the gates
inside the castle wall!
“I quickly mingled with the crowd
and filched some needed gold,
then passed the guardsman at the gates
to flee into the world.
“Soon I found myself in here
for winter had arrived,
and thanked the Mighty Onus
that I was still alive!”
I wintered there and learned this song,
this song that I have played;
And then my mentor went from there
to find that sacred place.
Here he paused to let them rest
and order food and wine;
Then he used the old outhouse
and sidled back inside.
He’d finished with his mentor’s song
and thought once more of him;
He wondered if he’d ever found
The Temple of Chagrin.
A smile crept across his face
as idle fingers strayed;
He knew his mentor would succeed—
at least, that’s what he prayed!
How could Onus let him fail
when He had chosen him?
Yes, his mentor had to find
The Temple of Chagrin.
A gentle touch upon his arm
with soft apology;
The serving wench had brought him back
from his reverie;
He coughed a bit and drunk some wine
then left the past behind;
He started in a melody
to complement his rhyme.
That day began my brief tenure
as apprentice bard;
My mentor taught me what he could,
then gave to me his harp;
He left with swiftness free of tears,
and I with saddened heart;
He sought The Temple of Chagrin,
and I to play his harp.
His journey I cannot describe—
I haven’t seen him since—
But mine has been a wondrous one,
and how it did begin!
Here the melody grew chipper,
though it seemed a bit downcast,
as he sang with fond remembrance
of a distant, budding past.
I walked in darkness through the day
and felt her eyes on me;
The forest, dank and dreary gray,
was perfect scenery
to keep her hidden from my eyes,
distorting every sound;
By nightfall, though, I knew for sure
that she would come around.
I made my camp with simple means
and cooked a bit of stew;
Then plucked my harp upon my knee
and sang a song or two.
When I paused to sip of wine
and softly fondle strings,
A tiny thing of brownish green
emerged from mighty tree—
The bark, itself, had split in two
and quickly closed behind;
The tiny creature looked at me
and quavered for a time.
I watched her nervous shivering;
She tried to hide it well;
I set my harp inside its case,
despite her startled yell.
We both were frozen for a time,
and then she turned to flee;
I stopped her with a playful note,
half-inside her tree.
She paused and slowly turned around,
and I began anew;
I played with vigor through the night,
and with each passing tune
the tiny creature edged more near,
until she brushed my arm.
It seemed to be a twist of fate:
the music was my charm!
I charmed the dryad with my song
and left her in the wood;
It saved my life and spared my heart—
which may not be for good!
I’ve heard the rumors—like the rest—
of how a dryad can
enthrall the heart, enslave the mind,
and love to death a man!
I speak for almost every man
who’s ever thought on it:
Of all the ways that we could die,
I think we’d all choose that!
There were some rueful chuckles
and playful crude remarks,
and when they settled down again,
his harp resounded dark.
My next encounter set me straight—
this world can be unkind—
I went in search of knowledge of
the Tomb of Chosen Rhyme.
I talked to many fellow bards
and learned from all of them;
It seems that sharing songs can bring
about some steadfast friends;
The first was Lillard of Highland—
the first elf that I knew—
It was he who told to me
the first of many clues.
It sent me to a far off land,
and soon I was quite lost;
But glad I was that I had gone,
and glad to pay the cost!
For this is where I found the song
that I will sing for you—
But be warned, it may be glum,
even though it’s true!
He paused to let the echoes fall
and then he froze his face;
His voice was somewhat less than hard,
and held them all in place.
How fortunate it was for me
to come into the town
upon the day of reckoning
for all the Raggamon;
They are the lordlings of the town
and somewhat less than sane;
They treat their people like their slaves—
except their favored men;
They love their boys in special ways
that we consider queer,
Since they prefer them young and prim
and full of naïve cheer.
They take the boys to raise them up
and fill their minds with fluff
that they protest with manly charm
is how they’re meant to love!
For generations long forgot,
these oddities have grown,
until their presence could be seen
throughout the tiny town.
I wandered in with open mind
that quickly seemed to close
when men in armor looked on me
with sensuous repose!
There is a saying that I’ve heard
about a wizard’s hut:
When in a stranger’s place,
it’s wisest not to touch!
I found an inn and got a room
and rested for a while,
and then a message came to me
from High Lord Pedi Fyle.
He is the seventh in his line,
despite his eerie bent;
He offered me a pouch of gold
to sing my songs for him.
I must admit to some distress—
my manhood is my own—
but then I gathered up my harp
and strolled about the town.
I chose to play a merry tune
that many like to hear;
About a dreadful little town
where everyone is queer;
It seemed the people were amused
until the guard came by;
The common folk were still oppressed:
The guardsmen showed me why.
But just before they locked me up,
I showed the guards the note
and asked them where the castle was
of which the High Lord wrote.
A guardsman checked the High Lord’s seal
and paleness struck his face;
He bowed down low and took me there
and warned me not to play
the merry song that he had heard
that roused the people’s ire,
unless I wished to be locked up,
fulfilling his desire.…
I took his warning as was meant
and waited in the hall
until there ushered in a man:
The High Lord Pedi Fyle.
A single glance was all it took—
It lingered far too long!
I was taken to the court
to hear his favorite song.
I listened as he played the lute
with skill and subtlety;
His voice was high and tinged with lust,
as was his melody;
He sang of boldness and of love
and how the two are shared;
He sang of boys in bonded state—
It didn’t seem so odd!
I felt his voice caressing me
with gentle puffs of air,
and then his lute was set aside—
but not so was his stare!
His voice was tender, whispering
the words his song entranced;
I strained to hear the dainty sighs
of boys lost in romance;
The power of his song was strong,
but when his arm touched mine
and gently played my tunic loose,
I felt deep in my mind
a warning of what was about—
The spell was woven well!
Then my will broke free of it,
and I reversed the spell!
I began to sing of love more
natural and complete,
of how a boy and girl could find
each other oh-so-sweet!
And then the lordling chuckled long
and softly pawed my chest;
He said that he would trade me songs
and asked to hear the rest.
He sat with straining ears and mind
and listened to each tune,
then played for me a tune in kind,
as bards are wont to do;
I know I stayed for near a week
before the trade was done,
and then I packed away my gear
to leave the little town.
But something seemed to be amiss—
The streets were all but bare—
And then I heard that siege was set,
and I was stuck in there!
I have a mind that’s free to roam,
and so I chose to play
a song for all the empty streets
of how the warriors pray:
They pray for guidance in their aim
and ask for courage, too!
But if their god’s forsaken them,
they pray for mercy, too!
I played them songs of bleak despair
and songs of death and doom,
and when the battle came to bear,
it ended rather soon!
The people gathered to rejoice,
and I played on and on,
until that night of revelry
had merged into the dawn.
I finally slept a dead-man’s sleep
and woke with clearer mind;
I gathered up my harp and gear
and left that town behind.
But just outside the broken gates,
I met up with a man
who paid me very well, indeed,
for working through his plan!
My duty to this man was done;
The battle was a rout;
I took the gold he handed me
and put it in my pouch;
The week had seen me gain so much
in gold coin and in song,
but somewhere in my churning mind,
I wondered: Was it wrong?
I seldom mingle with affairs
of man or beast or god;
My duty is to none of them:
It’s only to my songs!
But when my purse had gotten dry,
and I was much in need,
Lord Hammerstein proposed a plan,
and I too-soon agreed!
It doesn’t matter anymore:
The task I did is done;
But still my conscience questions it
and asks if it was wrong.
The notes were slyly tapered off,
as was his whispered word,
and then he set his harp aside
and went out through the door;
The room was quiet, but abuzz,
when he went back inside;
The morose mood he had enjoyed
was quickly set aside,
and in its place a forlorn look
was wryly written there;
With painful joy in every note,
his music filled the air.
As is the wont of many men
when winter snows abound,
I tend to find a village inn
where I can settle down
to hibernate until spring thaw
when birds and beasts awake,
and late one winter found myself
as restless as a snake.
The sun was warm, the air was crisp,
the snow was melting fast;
I could not stay a moment more,
a guest in Fowler’s Gap.
I packed my gear and stowed my harp
and said farewell to all;
They tried to warn me not to go
with words of late snow-fall.
I told them not to fret for me;
My woodsman skills are fine;
And then I strode with eager speed
to feast on fresh sunshine.
I walked all day and made my camp
as snowflakes fluttered down;
I gathered wood and made some stew
with snowflakes all around;
The snow was falling with such speed!
The inches mounted up,
and I began to wish I had
remained at Fowler’s Gap.
I kept my fire tended warm.
I tried to thwart the snow.
Soon the wind was howling out
that it was in control.
I guess it must have been two days
before the storm was done,
and when I woke, I was snowed in—
Where had the sunshine gone?
I managed things as best I could,
and near a fortnight passed;
My food was very nearly gone,
and I was at a loss!
The snow was deep, my fire warm,
and there I chose to stay.
I kept from losing wits and hope
with all the notes I played.
I played a tune of wordless pain,
of loneliness and fear,
and as I finished with its notes,
I saw a rabbit there.
Ask me not from whence it came,
for I have no idea,
but as I played another song,
it brought the rabbit near.
“Come, my little rabbit-friend,
I hunger for your bones;
My fire burns with warmth to spare,
and I am all alone.”
It edged in closer to me, then,
entranced but still afraid;
I called it nearer to my hand,
and this is what I said:
“Fear you not, my rabbit-friend,
for I will love you dear;
Come to me with twitching nose,
but come you not with fear.”
The rabbit soon was at my side,
and water filled my mouth:
What succulent and tasty meat—
of that, I had no doubt!
But as I reached to grasp its neck,
I saw a second beast:
A snow-cat had been chasing it,
my quaking little feast!
The snow-cat poised as if to jump—
my spell had eased away—
I clutched the rabbit to my chest
and found a way to play:
“Snow-cat leave your fangs agleam—
no need to bloody them;
This rabbit is too small to feed
both snow-cat and a man;
“So go you now and go in haste;
Return you not to here!
Leave this tasty morsel for my pot—
I caution you, take care!”
The snow-cat sat a moment more,
then sauntered off with pride;
I marveled at its poise and grace
in every bounding stride;
It disappeared into the wood,
and then I ceased to play;
The rabbit still was looking good,
but somehow I had changed.
I said with grim compassion
in an understated tone:
“Go now, little rabbit-friend,
go back to your home.”
I nudged the rabbit with my hand
and pushed it to the snow,
but it looked back with sullen eyes
and still refused to go.
I knew my hunger was too great
for sentimental whims,
and yet, the rabbit seemed to like
the warmth tied to my skin.
I told it it could stay a bit,
but then it had to go,
and then it said to me—I swear!—
“But I don’t like the snow.”
I know that snow can sometimes blind,
and solitude can kill;
Surely I had lost my mind—
But then the rabbit squealed:
“I like you bard; I will not go;
the fire feels too good.
My name is Astra. What is yours?
I dwell in yonder wood.”
My mind was dull; my voice was frozen—
How could this be real?
There couldn’t be a human tongue
within that rabbit’s squeal!
“What is wrong, my lovely bard?
Am I too small for you?
A rabbit really loves to breed,
and I thought bards did too!”
The rabbit hopped up to my side
and rubbed against my knee;
I could not take it anymore,
this strange insanity—
I grabbed the rabbit by the neck,
and I began to squeeze—
But something kept me from the kill—
I flung it to the trees.
I know the snow had eased her fall,
for soon I heard her voice.
“I see, my bard, I’m not your type—
Perhaps I should rejoice?
“I’ve waited years to be set free—
a kiss is all I ask—
I am a princess underneath
the curse the witches cast;
“Will you, Bard, be kind to me?
Nuzzle me but once?
If you do, I promise you,
I’ll leave you at first chance!”
The rabbit was once more in sight,
and I was quite insane;
I told her I would do the deed,
if she would just be gone!
She hopped with glee up to my knee
and offered me her nose;
I took a breath and kissed her quick,
just as she had proposed.
The change took time to come about,
but when she was herself,
I looked on beauty incarnate:
A lovely maiden elf!
My tongue was tied as once again,
she swept my words away;
She kissed me softly, warm with love,
and said a brisk good day!
She leapt with vigor through the snow
before I found my voice;
I yelled for her to wait for me—
but I had made my choice.
She never stopped her happy flight,
and I could not catch up;
To think I could have been her prince,
if I had not been gruff.
I stopped to stare upon the snow
where footprints, light and free,
had barely cracked the surface drifts
that swallowed up my knees.
I made my way back into camp
and sat with sorrowed heart;
I lost myself in favored songs
regaled upon my harp.
The snow-cat came back once again
to stare and swish its tail;
I stopped my song and looked at it,
and thought it just as well:
“Kill me then,” I said to it.
“Why?” was its reply.
“I could have been a prince today,
and now I wish to die.”
The snow-cat pondered on my words,
then leaped to sit by me.
“Kiss me well, my princely man,
and I shall be set free.”
I laughed aloud and cursed the gods,
then kissed the snow-cat’s lips;
I felt a stirring in its skin,
and at my fingertips
the snow-cat changed into a man
whose first act was to spit;
I mimicked him with earnestness
and more than some regret.
He drew his sword; he struck me down;
He stole all that I had;
He left behind my trusted harp—
For which I am quite glad!
I would have died a frozen twig,
if not for travelers
who saw the smoke of dying flame
and came to sell their wares.
When they arrived, my skin was cold,
but still my heart did beat;
They stirred a fire from the coals
and cooked some stew to eat.
When my fever finally broke,
and I was sane again,
I found that I had not gone far
before the snow set in.
The village was still fairly close,
and I was in a dale
that has been said to hold a ghost:
Fair Astra of the elves.
The tale they told of how a man
had loved her for a time,
but could not cope with growing old
while she remained so prime;
He paid some witches for a curse
that changed them both for good,
into the prey and hunter that
still roam those haunted woods.
It’s also said that travelers
have had the strangest dreams,
and this, they claimed, was all it was:
A sleeping fantasy.
It did not tell me where they went—
my clothes and golden coin—
nor did it tell me why I felt
my heart had been destroyed.
He let the little lost-boy look
remain for several notes,
and then he took a sip of wine
to ease his drying throat.
With idleness, he drew them in
with notes of growing greed;
They plucked the air with spritely tones
that gathered in their speed.
He let the notes trip on themselves
and let the music blur,
and when he started singing out,
his voice was somewhat slurred.
I had drunk a bit too much,
and soon my eyes grew blurry;
When I woke to sunlight’s touch,
I tasted something furry;
“What is this?” I asked the air
and prodded for an answer;
Then it came, and all at once,
I knew it spoke disaster!
Her sigh was lustrous, most content;
Her hands were gently straying;
Her bed was covered all in fur,
the bed where I was laying!
What I had done, I now recalled
in bits and pieces, only;
Had I said, with loosened tongue,
that I was feeling lonely?
Yes I had, and she’d replied
that she was lonely also.
Would I like to spend the night
inside her cozy hole?
I must have drunk more than I thought—
My memory’s uncertain—
For when I staggered through her door,
it looked like grasses woven.
Down a darkened stair we went—
It seemed to drop forever;
At the bottom was a room
that led into another;
There is where she took me next—
her inner sanctuary—
What happened there left me perplexed—
She was a bit too hairy—
The darkness seemed to ooze around
with sticky little fingers,
and even drunk it seemed unreal
and gave me tiny shivers.
Then a light without a source 
grew into twilight’s tenor,
and there she was in naked force,
leaning in its center.
If I had been a bit more sane,
I would have fled that creature,
But I was in a drunken state
and saw its perverse pleasure.
It may be strange—indeed, it was!
She was more cat than woman!
But supple were her dainty claws,
so full of pent-up passion—
I won’t describe the things we did,
nor how the morning ended;
It think it will suffice to say
that cat was simply splendid!
The crowd had grown with raucousness
that now was free to fly;
He let the people have their fun
until the jeering died,
And then he strummed a softer note
and looked upon the crowd;
Before he sang this song to them,
he turned his head and bowed.
They were perplexed, but not for long,
for he had sat back down,
and as he sang this song to them,
a feeling gathered round.
I’ve trod this path a hundred times,
though every step is new;
I choose a road to travel down
in search of worthy tunes.
My goal is simple in its lot,
as are the songs procured;
And every one I cherish dear,
as is the wont of bards.
I seek adventures to be held
and work them into song;
Every story that I’ve told,
has started out as one.
But many of the things I’ve seen
have not inspired me,
Like when I met some lonely men
who dwelled in misery;
Their lives were seen as worthless lots;
Their wives as painful woes;
I’ve seen ten thousand on my paths—
They’re everywhere I go.
They do not see what’s really there;
Instead, they just complain;
I wonder how they would react
if they lost all those pains?
And then, of course, the loves I’ve known
for days or weeks on end
have filled my heart with earnest song
that never reached my pen.
The children that I meant to have
have never come about,
but lullabies are waiting them,
here inside my mouth.
A man I knew and thought a friend
was somewhat less than that;
He tried to steal my harp and songs—
This was once his hat!
And then there was the farmer’s barn
that burned one summer night;
The village gathered to his cause—
it was a wondrous sight!
For all these things that touch my soul
and leave their stain in me,
I’ve never felt the urge to write
or sing or melody;
And so they all become a part
of all my other songs,
by filling up my spirit and
by creeping in among
the words and notes that I arrange
and play upon this harp—
Without this simple treasury,
I’d have an empty heart!
As I wander through the lands
in search of melodies,
I store these treasures where I can
amid my memories,
and when I find that special one
that builds into a song,
I let them settle in the words;
It’s where they do belong!
He stood and bowed a second time
and thanked them with his eyes.
“Such a song I sing for you
for all that you’ve supplied!”
He took a moment to relax
and let them mill about;
Then he leaned back once again
and sang with weary mouth:
I was looking for the satyrs
near the village of Dry Moon
to talk of bardic matters,
when I heard a wondrous tune.
It grew in volume in a clearing
deep within that sylvan wood;
Then I saw a satyr dancing
and I quickly understood.
Several others followed after—
one by one and in small groups—
I was awe-struck by the satyrs
playing on their silver flutes!
They danced and frolicked with abandon
as their flautists played some more;
Came the satyrs from the woodland,
chasing down a dreadful boor!
The boor was snorting, winded, panting;
Still he tried to speak his mind;
All the satyrs danced around him,
stomping out in perfect time!
Their songs were lively, vibrant pieces,
full of words I did not know;
The dreadful boor was crying, helpless,
as the satyrs aimed their bows!
The flautists’ tones were tuned to sorrow;
The satyr’s dancing slowed its pace;
The bows were knocked with poisoned arrows;
Solemn looks fell into place.
Then, as one, the notes were silenced,
and the arrows flew through air;
A moment later, their act forgotten,
the satyrs danced in joyous flair!
The dreadful boor was weeping gently—
Not in pain but pure relief—
The arrows missed him, evidently;
They had buried in a tree.
Then one satyr, gray and bearded,
spoke in garbled human tongue:
“You the boringest we’ve hearded:
come up not to here again!”
Then the satyrs gathered, joyous,
singing loudly to the wind;
As they went back in the forest,
I approached the weeping man.
I could see he was a minstrel
by the harp he clung onto,
but his singing must be dismal
for the satyrs were so cruel!
It was common knowledge to me,
ever since I was a boy,
That a satyr’s love for music
is their second favorite joy!
I consoled the weeping fellow
with the words I knew he’d hear:
“Hear you not the ogre’s bellow?
Hear you not the maiden’s cheer?
“Singing is a passion for us,
but for them, it is much more;
Pleasing them with human chorus
is a task for seasoned bards.”
I neglected to inform him
of my status as a bard;
I kept my mission coyly secret:
To approach the satyr lord.
Where this minstrel failed to please them,
I was certain to succeed;
In the village, I appeased him
with a tankard full of mead.
Then I left him drowning sorrow
and retired to my room
to prepare to sing tomorrow
songs of joy and songs of gloom!
I awoke with eager fingers
and a mind alert and fresh,
Then I went to find the satyrs
to explain my one request
to provide some entertainment
in the form of song and dance.
They agreed, a bit reluctant,
and I thanked them for the chance;
Then I sang a string of ballads
that bespoke of youth and spring;
By the third I’d met their challenge,
and they rose to dance with me!
It is a test a bard must answer
to be worthy of the name,
and as I watched the satyr dancers,
I could feel my growing fame.
Hours passed with little notice;
Days had come and gone!
We danced and sang two hundred ballads
before I went back to Dry Moon.
I stayed that winter in Dry Moon
and played them many songs;
My fame and fortune grew and spread
among the other towns,
and then one day in flurried snow,
there came a messenger.
He stood outside the tavern door
and bellowed for the bard.
I heard the voice like thunder claps
and saw the shaking wall;
I took a breath and went outside
to meet the man who called—
But, I found, to my distress,
no man was it outside;
A giant stood outside the door—
his shin was just my height!
I yelled “Good meet!” and craned my neck
to look up for his eyes;
He bowed down low and brushed the roof,
and here was his reply:
“Good meet, fair Bard! I bring to you
an invitation for
a night of revelry and song
provided by my lord.
He’s heard the tale of how you won
the favor of the satyr,
and asks for you to play for him—
if you are that worthy bard!”
I asked him who his lord might be,
and when this night would come;
He said it was the great and mighty
Thogg. Tonight would be the one.
Tonight! I thought with sudden dread,
for I was unprepared;
But challenges I can’t resist,
and so we went from there.
The giant plowed a healthy path
with his massive feet,
and through the drifts we made our way
into the forest deep.
We walked with plodding doggedness
until a cave appeared,
and then I felt a dread duress
with every step he cleared.
I did not wish to meet this Thogg;
I could not take my leave;
Would I be the giants’ guest?
Would I be their slave?
The giant stepped inside the cave—
There was nowhere to go—
I followed through the entryway
and down that retched hole!
The tunnel branched out several times,
but I marked every turn
with rhythmic beats I memorized
and lyrics quickly learned!
At last the giant stepped aside
and bade me to go on;
I took a breath—regretted it—
and then the dread was gone!
Inside the massive chamber,
sitting on his throne,
Thogg was playing idly
with a massive bone;
He glanced at me—a lowly sneer—
and set the bone aside;
“You will play, and I will hear, 
and then I will decide;
“If you deserve the fond acclaim
the satyrs have bestowed,
I will release you without harm
and you’ll be free to go!
“But if you fail to please my ear,
if your melodies fall flat,
if your bardic songs are poor,
you’ll end up there—with that!”
He gestured at a makeshift cage
high upon a shelf,
where that boorish minstrel raged,
fuming to himself.
I did not stare for very long—
What good would staring do?
Instead, I said, “There is a song,
that I can sing for you.”
The giant who had brought me here
plucked me off the floor
and set me on the stone cold shelf
near Thogg’s massive ear.
The giants watched, their gazes stern;
The minstrel looked away;
I plucked my harp; I struck a tune;
and I began to play.
I played a simple, friendly song,
a smile on my face,
and then I sang a second song
at slightly slower pace;
The third song sung was slower still;
The fourth had sluggish chords;
By the fifth—a lullaby—
the cave had filled with snores;
The minstrel was the first to fall;
Thogg was fast asleep;
I played a final whispered pall
to make sure it would keep.
The spell was perfect. I was free!
But where was I to go?
The shelf was high. The climb was steep.
There wasn’t any rope.
I saw but one way to escape,
to get me out of there:
Leap across a ten foot gap,
grab the giant’s hair,
slide down that giant’s rancid cloak,
and drop down to the floor.
Would the giant waken? Would
he sleep no more?
Would the sleep spell hold him fast?
Would my leap be short?
Would I find my way outside?
Back to Dry Moon’s warmth?
The choice I had was simple:
Take the risk or stay?
I roughly woke the minstrel;
I took the time to pray
to any god that listened,
to any god that cared,
and then I took that giant leap
that got me out of there!
The minstrel? He was with me.
The giants slumbered on.
The labyrinth? Confused me,
despite my simple song!
I sang the song correctly;
It led us both astray;
And then quite unexpectedly,
the minstrel saved the day!
The mistake I made was simple—
Indeed, a foolish one!
Without that boorish minstrel
I would have been undone!
I sang the song correctly,
if we were coming in;
But we were fleeing from that place,
from the other end!
I had to sing it backward—
no easy thing to do!
But that minstrel, though a boor,
helped me make it through!
He sang my lyrics in reverse,
off-key and dry as dirt,
And hummed the rhythms I had set
to get us out of there!
The entryway was dimly lit
by twilight on the snow;
The path the giant plowed for me
was outlined down below;
From there, our journey scampered;
We hastened to Dry Moon;
When we arrived, the innkeeper 
nearly fell into a swoon!
The giant had left them dismayed;
He thought we both had died;
He told us of the horrid tales,
of other bards who tried!
Few returned in haggard state,
their bodies bent and bruised;
Most had simply disappeared;
All had been abused.
The room I had he’d rented out;
The minstrel’s still was there;
He offered us a discount rate,
provided that we shared.
While we dickered on the price,
the floor began to quake;
A giant was approaching fast,
and then the giant spoke:
“I know the bard is in there now;
Thogg has sent me for him;
I demand you send him out—
or I will come in for him!”
The innkeeper had paled to ash
with the giant’s words,
and then he made a bellowed call
for the village guards.
They were there, in his inn,
amid the common room;
Dining, drinking, whoring, sleeping—
what guardsmen often do—
I looked at them; I glanced outside;
My choice was them or it;
“Wait!” I cried, as they approached,
“I’ll go out there if—”
I paused. They waited, took a step—
“the room is free ‘til spring!”
The innkeeper protested,
reluctantly agreed.
I stepped up to the inn’s front door;
I opened it with care;
Out I went with utmost caution,
to meet the giant there.
I did not know what he would do;
I was not free of fear;
The giant was the same one who
had led me to their lair.
Beside him was a massive cask—
Was it to be my cage?
He spoke before I even asked:
It was to be my pay!
He thanked me for the wondrous songs,
the deep refreshing sleep,
and said that Thogg had been impressed—
I was a bard, indeed!
The cask was full of potent beer—
a strange but pleasant taste—
I sold it to the innkeeper,
at the going rate.
I stayed there all that winter
and halfway through the spring;
I taught that boorish minstrel
how to play and sing!
He had a memory for notes,
for lyrics and a tune;
Technically, he was adroit,
but had the drollest croon.
I taught him how to pitch his voice,
when to pause his play,
how to modulate the notes
to pounce upon his prey!
By the time we parted company,
his skill had much improved;
A bard he still might never be,
but nevermore a boor!
He paused for longer than expected,
plucked a wayward string or two,
Felt fatigue as it descended,
ordered up a dwarven brew,
sipped the tankard slow and steady,
held it high above his head,
and when the silence had descended,
this is what he said:
I find that I am growing weary;
My throat is rough and sore;
The calluses upon my fingers 
fall in flecks upon the floor;
I’ll sing but one or two more ballads;
short and simply set;
And then retire to my chambers
so I can get some rest.
My journey here was long and troubled;
A week I plan to stay;
More songs I’ll play upon the morrow
and every other day!
His voice was hung in sadness;
His tone was mollified;
He played a morbid, tragic riff
meant to terrify!
The sudden shift to the macabre,
the drunken audience,
the mournful wails upon his harp,
the darkly lit cadence,
Evoked a tenseness held by fear
from all the gathered throng;
His music trembled on their ears
as he began his song.
Sometimes in the darkest hour
over lands that have no name,
My spirit leaves my body’s power
and escapes its fleshy grave;
Out in darkness flies my essence,
never falling from its height;
Even thought eludes my presence,
etched in shadow, lost to light;
Looking down from high above me,
seeing things like none before;
Every aspect of the scenery
‘cross the gray and empty shore
seems to whisper in the darkness,
drawing out a chilling sweat,
and reaches out with firm caresses
and the gentle kiss of death;
Volumes ripple through the stillness
spoken to the walking dead;
I return to roost, still restless,
in my coffin’s cushioned bed—
But the body isn’t comfy,
and the pillow is enslaved,
and I realize rather numbly—
I’m in someone else’s grave!
He finished with a playful flair;
The tension was released;
Cathartic laughter filled the air;
He barely even paused-
My final song this eventide
is known to all of us:
It is that tragic tale of yore,
the Ballad of Ignatius!
Exaggerating every letter, 
punctuating every sound,
Pontificating without mercy 
to his fellows gathered round,
Ignatius, Lord of Ullwart, 
ally to the King of Fyord,
Bequeathed some ballads lacking virtue—
save to those who loved his word!
Ineptitude beyond believing—
no one told the Lord the truth—
Except for Old Man Enri Opus,
widower of Princess Ruth.
Outspoken, careless, blind to reason, 
blind to all beyond his grief,
He confessed our common torture
as he sought to find relief:
“Oh, Lord of Ullwart, please forgive me,
please forgive this ancient man;
Perhaps my ears have but deceived me,
but I fail to understand;
“The ballad’s meaning has escaped me
and your voice is less than clear;
Another stanza that evades me
will destroy my tender ear!
“Indeed, my Lord, I beg for mercy;
May an old man take his leave?”
The silence stumbled for a moment
so the Lord could quickly weave
a web of answers strewn in verses
that were sung in perfect time.
“My friend, forgive me for my folly,
but my meaning is sublime;
The Ballad of the Ancient Dragon
is important to my task,
but I find no sincere reason
to refuse you what you ask.”
Appeasing both the Lord of Ullwart
and the ballad that was sung,
old Enri Opus bowed with honor
where he once had tightly clung.
The door closed; the silence lingered;
then the Lord of Ullwart said,
“I will not stop for interruption,
save for someone nearly dead.”
The venom of the words he whispered
carried through our chilling bone;
Then we listened to his playing,
reminiscent of a groan!
As his rhythms gathered slowly, 
bonding into something whole,
a sense of deep, impending danger
grabbed us in its eerie pull;
When he finished with the tragic
tale of ancient dragon lore,
enthralled by visions he had brought us
of that mighty carnivore,
we were waiting for the symbol
that would free us from his spell;
We were at the heartless mercy
of a Master Bard from hell!
Paralyzed by song and magic,
we were frozen in our place;
The Lord of Ullwart drew his sword and
moved before the fireplace;
Enveloped in the smoke and cinder,
he appeared the devil’s son,
approaching Vester with his weapon—
fiendishly, he had begun
the massacre of all his fellows—
Lords and Princes, Queens and Maids—
Laughter—haunting, dry, malicious—
rang out as his sword was raised—
But it was stifled to a gurgle
as an arrow struck his throat;
Buried deep within his chortle
it had done its deadly work!
Ignatius collapsed in silence;
His lifeblood squirted free;
The spell was broken in his dying;
With his death we were set free!
Amazed that we had not been taken
by the frigid grip of death;
Confused by all that was occurring,
I inhaled a strangled breath;
Then I saw our savior standing
calmly setting down his bow;
It was old man Enri Opus
who had come to overthrow
the Lord of Ullwart, who had visions
of becoming King of All;
Instead he met the old man’s arrow
in his Winter Dining Hall!
It seems that old man Enri Opus
felt the magic of the spell
And knew the Lord of Ullwart meant to
send the gathering to hell.
We thanked him with our hearts and pockets,
making sure his needs were met,
and then I spun this simple ballad
to ensure we don’t forget.
Elaborating but a moment,
I will sing but one more line:
The Lord of Ullwart was my brother,
and his goal was also mine!
Despite their clamor for more ballads,
his harp was set aside;
His dwarven brew was quickly guzzled,
and he called it a night.
The days went by, the songs were sung,
then came the time to leave;
They plied him well with silver coin,
fine food, and potent drink.
He left them with a fond farewell
when wanderlust sunk in.
Some months went by, and then he met
a long-remembered friend.
Part 2
It happened in a village inn,
late one stormy night;
He’d taken refuge from the rain
until the morning light;
While he slept—despite the gloom—
a thief amid the dark
crept silently into his room
and stole his trusty harp!
In the morning when he woke up
and saw his harp was gone,
he searched the room in panic—
nothing else was gone!
Just the harp, his trusted harp,
his livelihood and love;
He fled the room—and came up short—
the hallway was abuzz
with soft refrains he recognized:
His harp was being played!
A muffled but familiar voice
sang in bold refrains!
He took a breath and made his way
to the common room;
He paused amid the entryway
and joined in the song!
I’m about to sing a ballad
of two brothers tied by blood;
One I knew for but a moment—
He was fair and pure and good!
His mentor smiled and kept plucking
without missing any beat;
He approached him, strongly singing,
as he pulled up a second seat!
The betrayal of his brother
struck him down to beggars’ clothes;
All he had in his possession
was his sword and broken bow;
He was cursed to poorest stature
and condemned to live in fear;
For his brother, trusted brother,
could not bear to have him near.
It was brought on by a woman
whom they both had loved so dear;
So they battled for her beauty
and replay it once a year.
A bitter wedge had grown between them;
Their arms were crossed again;
Combined with two long-silent voices,
full of anger, full of pain.
Thrust and parry, flash and flurry,
dodge the weapons’ deadly blows;
From the battle’s hurry-scurry,
I observed enough to know:
Answers seldom come through violence,
though the problem might seemed solved;
Anger boils in its essence,
stewing ‘til it has evolved
into something vile, vicious,
well beyond our firm control;
When we’ve paid the worst of prices,
one too costly to behold!
It’s a sad and sordid story,
one that never seems to end,
when a brother must be buried
by another he called friend.
As they battled on in silence,
faces masks of hate-filled glare,
Brilliant, deadly, sword-blade dances
of two men whose skills compare.
Neither seems to be the better;
Every parry meets a thrust;
When exhausted, they give quarter—
as they knew they surely must!
Once a year in humble splendor,
the beggar and the lordling fight;
Neither one will be the victor,
for the curse is strung too tight;
In the center of attention
as the tears of sorrow flow;
I have seen that weeping beggar
watch his lordling brother go
to a quiet narrow valley
where his brother lay in vain
in a ghostly mausoleum
with the lordling’s tortured name.
That was where the beggar’s curse was;
That is where my mentor went;
That is where he strung these verses
for that beggar and his kin!
A few more dainty, soft refrains;
His mentor stilled the harp;
He nodded briskly: “We meet again,
my not-so-humble bard!”
“Indeed, my friend” his quick response,
“and I heard you were dead!”
His mentor shifted in his stance,
“I nearly was,” he said.
The crowd was small, impatient,
and called out for more song;
They paused in their reunion
to sing a second one:
This song was born in ruins
overgrown by knotted pine
that tangled up the memories
and twisted up the rhymes;
Those woods were borne of angry men
whose eyes have long-since closed;
Their ears will never hear again;
They’ve been too-long exposed;
Their skin has crawled from flesh and bone
and fed the plants around;
Their limbs will never stand alone,
will never dance around;
The muscles that were once so trim
are trimmer, now, indeed;
They fed the roots their nutrients
and sated growing seed;
The trees are dank and strangely warped,
as if in anguished pain;
The vines that drape like fetters worn,
resemble tarnished chains;
The undergrowth is rich with rot,
and fungus thrives therein;
Their presence tells of things forgot
and years that lie between’
But if you listen for the wind
on days too still to break,
You may perchance to hear the men
if they should deem to speak;
You’ll hear the cries of horrid death
in these, their graven woods;
With every leaf, their passing breath
is fully understood;
The trees reflect their mad repose;
The rot reflects their mind;
But who are they? No one knows,
these soldiers left behind.
His mentor shifted melodies
without the slightest pause,
a strident tone with urgency—
a little dangerous—
He did not know the ballad;
He could not sing the words;
His mentor winked and then began
amid the eerie chords:
The land that I was walking through
was lush with greenery;
It surrounded me with pleasantness
and lovely scenery;
The trees were set in careful groves
with glens at every turn;
The flowers were like beauty froze
within the misty morn.
The streams were full of burbled words
and fish that leapt about;
The birds were singing brilliantly
with liveliness throughout;
It seemed the chatter of the squirrels
was more than simple sound—
Until they all were hushed at once,
and silence gathered round.
I stopped and looked with keenest eye
and saw but not a thing;
I stood as still as death, itself—
I stood there listening—
The silence seemed to be complete
until a twig was snapped;
I caught a whiff of horse-like sweat
and glanced a hunter’s cap.
The head appeared above a bush,
as did the bow he held;
The arrow, knocked, was aimed at me;
I was standing still.
The sound of branches parting
resounded in my ears;
Others moved in from behind,
and still I felt no fear;
If they had meant to cut me down,
I would have died by then;
I waited for their leader’s words
before I spoke to him;
The voice behind me was a full
and rumpled baritone;
It was the kind a lover has
that makes the women moan;
“Who is this?” he asked the air
and prodded me with spear;
“A little man is in our woods?
What is he doing here?
“Perhaps he is in need of work—
a target for our game?
Tell me, human, who are you? 
What is your little name?”
I spoke my name in centaur tongue
and bade them all good meet;
I told them I was just a bard
in search of challenging.
A silence fell upon the wood;
the arrows all were dropped;
Their leader circled to the front—
There he chose to stop.
He pondered me with intellect;
He slowly bowed down low;
“Good met, fair bard, and welcome
to the centaur home.”
The pleasantries were traded well;
Apologies, forgot;
And soon I found myself a guest
in that centaur’s hut.
It is a custom in their land
that bards are given rest;
On the morrow, with the dawn, 
they may attempt the test.
First a song is played for him,
then he plays for them;
The last one to run out of song
will be the one to win;
The prize is known by many bards,
but few have ever won;
It is a silver, magic harp
that never loses tone;
The centaurs charge a healthy sum
from every challenger,
but if the bard should be the one
to sing with greater splendor;
He may keep the magic harp
and use it as his own,
but when he dies it is returned,
since it is but a loan.
To ensure its safe-keeping,
the centaurs give the bard
some twenty members of their pack
to be his honor guard.
We started playing at the dawn,
and songs were sung all day;
By midnight neither one had won,
and sleep was still to wait!
The centaurs reveled through the night
as we played on and on;
For several days, it went like this,
until the seventh dawn;
Exhausted, both in body 
and repertoire of song,
The centaur played his final tune,
and I played my last one;
The centaur laid his harp aside
and bowed with deep respect;
The magic harp would soon be mine—
if I had one song left!
I searched my mind with utmost care,
but nothing could I find:
The challenge could not be complete—
the challenge was a tie!
Even though I did not win,
the centaurs honored me;
They kept the magic harp, of course,
but gave me back the fee.
A dozen centaurs rode with me,
as escort and as guard,
for sixteen days I was, to them,
The Master Bard of Bards!
It wasn’t ‘til they were long gone
that I could sadly smile;
I could have sung them one more song
about Lord Pedi Fyle—
But that was not my purpose;
I did not want the harp;
The purpose was the challenging:
It was its own reward!
His mentor let the music fade
and handed him the harp;
“A song, my friend, a fair exchange,
as is the wont of bards.
“Sing for me a ballad!
Sing for me a tale!
The last we’ll play upon this day—
Make sure you choose it well!”
He took the harp and strummed a chord;
A friendly melody;
He knew his mentor hadn’t heard
The song he chose to play:
There is a village that’s purported
to exist in wasted lands,
a lush oasis that’s supported
by a god’s most kindly hand;
In this seldom spoken legend,
there is hinted many times
of a relic that’s been hidden
in the Tomb of Chosen Rhyme.
It is there that I have dreamed of
finding glory, fame, and song,
and I searched out other legends
speaking of that relic’s home!
Such as Roland’s Yodeled Ballads—
True, they are a bit obscure—
There I found the key I needed,
in his convoluted verse!
Next, I gathered my equipment,
stowed some loaves of travel-bread,
and started on my fateful quest
filled with hope, full of dread!
I won’t describe the paths I traveled
to that relic’s sacred home,
and I’ll skip the tawdry battles
that I struggled through alone.
Silence, endless, free from people
can be treasure for a few,
But my need to be with others
grew and grew, grew and grew—
Until at last, my lonely roaming
in that desert’s wretched heat,
left me dizzy with confusion,
without water, no food to eat;
I passed into a blessed darkness,
succumbed to sleep’s embrace,
knowing that I would not waken.
The blinding sun upon my face.
But, of course, I did awaken—
How much later, I don’t know—
Above me was a wondrous maiden,
smothered in the sunlight’s glow;
That maiden saved me, nursed me,
brought me back to healthy state;
Then she acted as my guide
and led me to that sacred place.
I was in the lush oasis
that I’d hunted for so long,
searching for that sacred relic
mentioned in the legend’s song!
The maiden led me through her village
to the Tomb of Chosen Rhyme,
but she did not follow after,
did not go into the tomb.
I approached with cautious footsteps,
wary eyes, and gentle hands;
The legend spoke of dangers, secrets,
pitfalls that would slay a man!
Only he who was deemed worthy
could approach the relic’s home;
If he was found to be unworthy,
all he’d find would be his tomb!
Every time there was a pitfall—
Every time that danger came—
I avoided being wounded;
I avoided being lamed!
Then I found a hidden trapdoor
with a passageway beneath;
I drop so softly to the floor—
stirring up the scent of death!
The passage ended in the distance
at a silver-plated door,
I heard voices, lots of voices,
overlapping, muddled words!
Quiet whispers, quickly spoken,
fell upon my well-trained ear;
Words of warning were betokened
of a doom awaiting there!
Heedless of the garbled warning
from these voices merged as one,
Shrugging off my indecision,
I stepped forward; I moved on.
As I crept up to the doorway—
It opened magically!
Light erupted in the passageway,
nearly blinding me!
My eyes adjusted quickly;
This is what I saw:
A thing of utmost beauty:
A gem-encrusted harp!
The voices called harmonically;
Their welcome most robust;
They called to me, joyously,
“Come and join us!”
I took a step inside the room—
Their chorus rose in pitch!
I held my hand out for the harp—
How could I resist?
But as I reached out for the harp
to touch its magic strings,
the echoes of a long-dead bard
said these words to me:
“The price of glory that you seek
will weather down your soul;
It is not meant for human hands:
Take flight, my son, and go!”
I knew that voice from long ago—
It taught me how to sing—
It was my father’s gentle tone
reaching out to me!
It broke the rapture of the harp;
I dropped my reaching hand;
The clamor of the other bards
renewed their brisk demand!
“Come! Come! Come, my friend!
Join us in here!
Play! Play! Pluck a strand
for all of us to hear!”
How alluring was this relic?
A moment more, I would be lost!
But slavery to that instrument
was far too great a cost!
I turned and fled that dreadful place
before I could succumb,
despite that relics’ urgent pleas
to join Chosen Rhyme!
His voice fell silent;
His music carried on;
The urgency was spent;
The song continued on:
The maiden who had saved me
could not believe her eyes;
No one ever had returned;
No others had survived!
I did not tarry with her;
I did not tell my tale;
I had to flee that harp’s allure
before I was compelled
to return and touch the harp,
to rescind my soul,
to join all those other bards
under its control.
My father left when I was nine
upon a foolish quest:
He sought the Tomb of Chosen Rhyme,
and there he failed the test.
But through his failure, I was saved:
The harp did not snare me.
Through his failure, I was saved:
I roam the world still free.
With this ballad, I honor him:
I had gone upon my quest
to find the Tomb of Chosen Rhyme
to bring to him success!
Instead, I found my father—
a tortured, troubled soul—
captured by that relic,
under its control.
I had no way to free him;
I had to leave him there;
But I can warn the other bards
to stay away from there!
He played a few more cautious notes;
He set the harp aside;
His mentor clasped his shoulder;
He had no tears to cry.
The crowd, though small, regaled them well,
with coin and gratitude;
The innkeeper provided them
with wine and ample food;
An hour later, they found themselves
strolling down the road.
“It is time,” his mentor told him,
“for the meeting of the bards.”
“What is that?” he asked his mentor.
“Where will it take place?”
“I cannot tell you where we gather
for the great exchange;
“I must take you to the meeting
of the Master Bards;
Only those who have a patron
get to play their harps.”
They travelled down the secret paths
that led them to a lake,
and rowed out to a tiny isle,
where they had to wait.
A dozen Master Bards were there;
Four more yet to come;
Not a ballad had been shared;
No songs had yet been sung;
The sharing would come later,
when the time had come,
and he would take the center
to prove that he belonged;
His songs would be inspected;
His play would be critiqued;
The Master Bards would test him
before they would bequeath
the title of a Master Bard,
accept him as their own.
Then would start the steady trade
of all their new-spun songs!
Part 3
The time had come for them to sing;
The Master Bards were there;
Encircled in a granite ring
with magic in the air;
Sixteen Master Bards sat still;
Four initiates would sing;
The moon had risen, bright and full,
above the gathering;
The stone bequeathed an eerie glow;
The night grew eerie-calm;
The Master Bards deferred as one
to the greatest of them all.
“We are summoned to this isle
for this sacred task;
Once a decade we compile
all our songs and ask:
“Should new members be allowed
within our special ranks
to become a Master Bard
for all the songs they sang?
“Those with skill of melody,
those with skill of tongue,
are far from such a rarity
that few of them belong;
“Minstrels, troubadours—
they can sing and play,
but Master Bards spin magic words
that others can’t evade!
“Many bards spin magic well;
Many have the gift;
But few there are who can excel—
some are in our midst;
“The test we have is simple:
Four songs you will play!
Spin for us a magic spell
to prove that you should stay!”
The Master of the Master Bards
turned expectantly,
to another Master Bard’s
youthful protégé.
The youth took up his lyre,
propped it on his knee,
thrummed some notes, cleared his throat,
and strung a melody.
This song may be familiar
to such a worthy host;
It is the Song of Aster Gray,
a badly troubled ghost!
I was staying near the palace
of an oft-admired king,
When they called me to bear witness
of her tragic passing.
I took my lyre to her bedside—
She lay as pale as ice—
I played my sweetest ballads,
softest lullabies;
I played and played those soothing songs
until her time had come,
and then I set my lyre down
and left her private room.
She was buried without treasure
in a simple tomb of stone—
a mausoleum for the daughter
of a mistress of the throne.
I was paid and left the palace;
I sought out other songs;
I was still in search of ballads
when the new moon came along.
A farmer offered to provide me
shelter from a coming storm;
The food was simple that he gave me,
but his hearth was toasty-warm;
I repaid him for the kindness;
I sang his daughter lullabies;
I eased her terror from the lightning
and the mighty thunder’s cry!
His music slowed. His voice spoke low.
His eyes went far away.
He barely whispered what came next,
amid his soft refrain.
The lullabies I sang to her
were very much the same
as those I sang to Aster Gray
on her passing day;
The farmer’s daughter, Aster Gray—
they were of an age—
and when I sang those lullabies,
they brought her back again!
Her ghostly apparition—
still as pale as ice!—
slowly manifested—
much to my surprise!
It settled down upon the bed
next to the farmer’s daughter,
and listened to the songs I played,
and lingered long thereafter.
He paused his play. He scanned the ring.
He finished without music.
You may think this song to be
little more than tragic,
He pointed with dramatic flare
just beyond the circle.
But there she is, Aster Gray,
my sad little miracle!
There she was, that apparition,
floating just above the ground
just beyond the circle’s fringe,
making not the slightest sound;
The greatest of the Master Bards,
bemused but not impressed,
turned to the initiate
and asked, “Illusion, yes?”
She is not mere illusion;
She is not mist and fog;
She is an apparition
summoned by my song!
She follows me everywhere;
She haunts my lullabies;
And when I sing of Aster Gray,
she makes a baleful cry!
As if she knew the time was ripe,
She let loose a horrid wail,
A doleful shriek into the night,
as if she were impaled—
The Master of the Master Bards,
waved his aged hand;
He muttered but a few crisp words,
and Aster Gray was gone.
The young man frowned then smiled,
shrugged without concern,
struck a playful little tune,
and finished up his turn:
At least, that’s what I tell them,
when those have dared to ask,
but, yes, it is illusion—
My special bardic cast!
I weave the magic in my songs
to bring them more alive,
but only for the special ones—
when the time is right!
The young bard set aside his lyre;
His mentor deigned to speak;
“A fine display of bardic flair—
Would you not agree?”
Before the murmurs could erupt,
the Master of the Master Bards
held up his hand to interrupt,
and said, “It is a worthy start.
“But that is all; there will be more—
far more before we’re through!
We must consider all the chords
before this night is through!
“He has three more songs to sing;
Three others still to start;
So let us move on with this thing,
and hear another bard!”
Another of the protégés
was given leave to play,
He strummed his lute with playful ease,
and limpid, dainty strain.
I met a woman in the market
who proclaimed to me,
her name was Aaron Breedlove
a man of tragedy!
She said she had a story,
a tragic, woeful tale,
one that bards would sing of—truly!—
about a haunted wishing well.
Here he paused to softly mutter
words too low for them to hear;
In their minds they seemed to gather,
soon becoming all too clear!
He was speaking words of magic,
which his music had enhanced;
They were growing more romantic
as his lute-strings softly danced!
The music eased into a passion
held in place by will alone;
He began to play at random,
wildly shifting pitch and tone;
This display of random patterns
seemed to build upon a frame,
and when his voice returned unbidden,
it struck them all like drops of rain!
Aaron Breedlove was a young man
born of nobles from Old Port;
He was raised to learn of ruling,
but was not the ruling sort.
So he left his father’s castle
at a tender, youthful age,
shedding all his royal duties,
seeking for a better way!
Through the weeks that quickly followed,
he became much more aware
that a woman was quite different—
more than form and lustrous hair!
Then one day in drunken stupor,
came he to a wishing well;
Far beyond the grasp of reason,
far too drunk to sanely tell,
he tossed in a pouch of silver—
Not for him a single coin!
As he stood there—no, he tottered—
pondering what could be gained,
an image of the lovely maiden
gave him insight for his wish:
“I wish to understand a woman!
I wish to know just what she is!”
When he finished his transaction,
thinking only of the maid;
There began an odd sensation,
and he felt his manhood fade!
Searching quickly for its presence,
with his dainty fingertips,
He could not conceive its absence—
Yet he could not find a grip!
Overcome by drunken terror,
weeping in a drunken fit,
he ran off in naked horror
trying to locate it!
At length, he slumped against a tree trunk;
At last, exhausted, he passed out;
In the morning, when he woke up,
the wish, the loss, had been forgot!
A headache was consuming him.
A chill was on his skin.
His bladder, full, demanding—
His cold and empty hand—
The urine flowing down his thigh—
brought him to his senses
and reminded him of the night,
of the wish, and of his losses!
A strangled cry escaped his lips—
A high-pitched female squeal!
A frantic search that bore no fruit—
The wish had been for real!
His tones were clipped and hectic;
The magic had been strung;
The bards within the circle
 shifted—every one!—
A woman sat for every man,
and each looked on in dread—
could they forbid inclusion
of this wretched bard?
His song was nothing special,
the music sharp and blunt—
But the magic that he could control
was far more than enough!
A dreadful fear enveloped them:
What if the shift he’d done
to change them all to women
became a permanent one!?
Before this fear consumed them,
before they fled their plight,
his wretched song had been resumed,
and sucked them deep inside—
Weeks went by in sorrowed state;
His manhood remained lost;
He sought out wizards, asked for aid,
whatever was the cost!
For two long years he struggled;
For two long years he fought;
For two long years, he remained
a man in a woman’s body.
And then one day, it ended:
He accepted what she was.
He became a lovely maiden;
He became a dainty host;
He became a serving wench;
He became a cook;
He went shopping in the market;
He learned how to knit;
A year of this—and more!—went by
before I heard her tale,
And I agreed a tragedy
about a wishing well
would make a splendid bardic song,
one that I would sing!
And sung I have, that wretched song,
despite the change it brings!
The Master Bards were near to tears;
His lute fell to a mumble;
Several seconds passed before
the lute strings softly hummed;
The gathered bards were patient—
The music still was playing—
They waited for the song to finish—
He turned to them, saying:
Such went that fateful meeting,
in the marketplace,
but I returned anew in spring
to find there was no trace
of the woman Aaron Breedlove,
of that tragic maid;
But of the man named Aaron Breedlove,
much more may be said!
The wish he made that fateful day
had long-since been fulfilled:
He understood the woman’s way;
He understood her skill;
Once he had accepted it,
when man he was no more,
the wish he’d made relented,
and he was man once more!
The magic in the lyrics—
The music in the spell—
The Master Bards were men again!
Their dread was gone as well!
The spell within my ballad,
The feelings that it brought,
We’re only figments in your mind—
No changes have been wrought!
The power of suggestion
and hypnotic play
were all the magic held within
the song I played today!
The Master of the Master Bards
held up his aged hand;
“A potent spell,” was all he said,
then gestured to a man
who held a pair of wooden drums
covered by deerskin.
When silence fell, he nodded once:
“Now you may begin.”
His drums were three in number—
each a different size;
His boots had tiny cymbals—
cleverly disguised;
The largest drum thumped out a beat—
b-BOOM! b-BOOM! b-BOOM!
A heavy thudding, pulsing beat—
b-BOOM! b-BOOM! b-BOOM!
The cymbals tinkled now and then;
The other drums were struck;
Their softer, shriller pattering
stole away their breath—
Their heartbeats matched his rhythm—
b-BOOM! b-BOOM! b-BOOM!
And when he had them in his grip,
he sung of death and gloom!
I trained with sword and shield
throughout my youthful years,
and then there came that fateful day
I first wore battle gear.
I looked and felt a prideful man
in splendid finery;
Complete with tassel-crested helm
and weighty armory;
The feeling didn’t last too long—
I was much surprised
to find an itch I had to scratch,
right between my thighs!
I twitched a bit and ground my teeth
and forced my hand to stay;
The itch grew on relentlessly,
and I began to pray!
“O God of War have mercy!
Grant me strength of will!
The enemy is growing near,
and they’re intent to kill!
“This itch is too distracting;
This itch is in the way!
By all the oaths that I can bring,
Take this itch away!
“I’ll spill much blood, I swear to you!
The enemy will die!
Just end this dreadful itch I have!
I will bravely fight!”
The God of War was silent;
My plea was cast aside;
The itch grew more demanding
with each and every stride!
The itch spread wildly down my legs
and up my back and chest;
Ignoring it as best I could,
I went with the rest!
We joined ranks behind the king,
his banner in my hand;
The itch had grown relentlessly—
I could barely stand!
I twitched, I itched, I whimpered—
My comrades looked at me—
And then I dropped the banner—
Ripped my armor free—
I scratched that itch—and all the rest!—
and rolled upon the ground;
I could not stop that wretched itch,
despite the battle sound!
I writhed upon the sodden earth;
The call to arms was made;
I tried to stand; I tried to march—
I ripped my clothes away!
The sound of clashing swords arose
upon the battlefield;
I grabbed my sword, sought out the noise,
and made a vicious yowl!
I must have looked a dreadful sight—
naked with a sword—
a deep red rash from head to foot,
an angry, pain-wracked scowl!
I charged into the melee’s ranks,
but every man I neared,
backed away, did not engage,
as if consumed by fear!
The battle waged throughout the day
and deep into the night;
Though I fumed, though I raged,
no blows I struck that fight!
Twilight fell as dawn approached;
The enemy were dead;
The itch was barely tolerable;
My skin was crimson red;
Welts consumed my chest and thighs;
Blood oozed from open wounds;
I tried to help the injured, tried
to tend their wounds,
but every time I came near,
they paled and shied away;
They put up such a clamor,
that I was sent away.
At noon, the healer came to me;
He looked me up and down;
He shook his head and asked me:
“When did the itch begin?”
I told him all that I could tell;
He shook his head again;
He offered me an ointment;
I spread it on my skin;
The ointment worked like magic;
My itchiness was gone!
I asked him what had caused it—
He shook his head again.
“The armor that you donned today,
The padding underneath,
enflamed your skin because you have
a dreadful allergy.”
My warrior’s days were over;
No cure was there for me;
If ever I wore armor,
that rash would torture me!
I did not leave my sword behind;
I did not cease to train;
I left the service of the king
and never fought again!
The drumbeats and the cymbal
slowly disappeared,
until one sound alone remained,
the first one that they heard:
The steady, thudding, pulsing beat—
b-BOOM! b-BOOM! b-BOOM!
Then he changed its stolid pace,
until it had slowed down
to half a beat each second—
Then slower still it went—
Each time the beat had been reduced
they felt their heartbeats skip!
All at once the beat was stopped—
Their heartbeats also ceased!
They clutched their chests and gasped—
He smiled wickedly!
Then, all at once, he slapped his drum—
a sharp, resounding BOOM!—
All their hearts beat free again,
free from his magic tune!
The Master of the Master Bards
was first to catch his breath;
He glared at the initiate
and then he shook his head!
“Our magic is not meant to kill;
Our magic should not harm;
Our magic ought to help, to heal,
not to raise alarm.
“I do not doubt your talent;
I do not doubt your skill;
But what about your motive?
Is yours an evil will?”
The drummer sat, admonished,
and then his patron spoke:
“Master, do not be so cross—
Can’t you take a joke?”
The Master of the Master Bards
rebuked him yet again:
“Such folly is misguided
and you should understand!”
“Indeed, I do—both you and he;
His humor is perverse!
His bardic skill exemplary!
Forgive his playful jest!
“Look beyond your discomfort!
Look beyond your fear!
See what sits amid our court:
A Master Bard for sure!”
The Master of the Master Bards
sadly shook his head;
“Perhaps it’s you who are misguided,
if you think the jest was good.”
He waved away the protest,
“No matter, we shall see
who among the four there is
on which we’ll all agree.
“For now, there is but one to play,
and when his song is through;
We shall retire to consider
what we are to do.”
The conflict wasn’t over,
but had been set aside;
His mentor turned and winked at him;
His harp lay at his side;
The Master of the Master Bards—
His mentor and his friend—
Gestured with sincerity,
and said, “You may begin.”
He set the harp upon his knee;
He strummed an impish chain;
He shook his head in misery—
There was no way to win.
He sighed and set the harp aside.
He looked upon the bards.
He sought the magic deep inside.
He lifted up his harp.
I do not know if this is true
or just some minstrel’s tale,
but I will sing and play it through,
then bid you all farewell!
His mentor frowned and stared at him;
the others looked askance;
But once the song had been begun,
it put them in a trance!
In the rafters of a temple
was a wicked, wicked man,
who came to steal the silver
in the coffers of the clan.
He crouched inside of shadow
like a spider for a fly;
He watched the priestess praying
and the others walking by;
With an effort more than human
that he thought could not be done,
he waited without patience
as they walked out, one by one,
and then the priestess was alone,
her candle burning low;
He scampered down the temple wall
and landed in a roll.
A sudden flash of burnished steel;
Darts went singing past;
They found a home with sickly speed,
deep in the priestess’ flesh.
The priestess doubled over
with a squawk and muted prayer;
The poison tips had done their job
with little left to spare.
The wicked man was ruthless;
He rifled through her corpse;
He took the pendant from her neck
and earrings from her lobes!
The copper coin she’d kept for luck
had failed her on this day;
It came to rest with subtle clunk,
when he put it fast away.
Then off he went with silent speed
to get the altar stones;
He knew the temple rooms by rote:
They once had been his home!
He found the treasure room with ease,
despite the traps they’d set;
He placed his feet with purpose,
and his thoughts were firmly set.
Three coffers stood within the room.
Two were filled with death.
The third one had a needle trap,
where silver bars were kept.
With that chilling thought in mind,
he worked with special care;
When the poison needle flew,
he wasn’t standing there;
Before the deadly trap reset,
he smashed the coffer’s lock
and placed the silver that he found
beneath his priestly smock.
He eased his way with cautious steps
back to the outer hall;
He scampered with a spider’s skill
up the temple wall;
He rested on the rafter’s perch
until the morning light,
and when the hue and cry went out,
he joined in the fright!
His agitation was sincere,
if from a different source;
He was afraid he would get caught
and lose his life, of course!
But in the crowded temple hall—
Priests were everywhere—
One more priest was just ignored,
and he escaped from there.
An acolyte with nervous eyes 
and too much intellect
confronted him outside the halls
and quickly met his death.
The body fell with wilting ease,
and soon it would be found;
The wicked man fled with haste
to leave the temple ground.
When he reached the sacred grove
where he had left his steed,
he found the tether had been cut—
and cursed the other thief!
He heard the cries of hungry dogs,
and chills slipped down his spine;
They settled in his empty gut
and told him he would die!
As the notes were finely gathered;
When his words had all been sung;
He released the tautened harp strings;
Into darkness, he was flung!
As his body slumped and tumbled,
all the Master Bards looked on;
Then his mentor, fearful, stumbled,
sought a pulse—the faintest one!
They were frantic, tried their magic—
His protégé did not respond;
Several seconds passed by, hectic,
then a voice came from beyond:
He is but a young apprentice;
He does not belong with us;
Does he have such mighty magic?
Does he have a wondrous voice?
I am Randolph Weaving Fingers—
You may know me from before—
I was one among your number,
in the tepid days of yore!
An ancient bard emerged from shadow,
moved into their startled midst,
picked up harp and started playing,
gentle, soothing, tragic riffs.
I’ll sing to you of awe and wonder
at the mighty task I saw
and bring to you a broken feather
from the wing of Dragon’s Claw!
Those monks are known by many people
as a mercenary band;
They work for any who pay silver
to perform the tasks at hand.
I stumbled on their mad endeavor
late one chilly afternoon,
and then I could not help but wonder
if their deaths were coming soon!
Even madmen would not enter
in the lair of Darkwing Bane—
How could they expect to kill her
and her mighty dragon flame?
I thought to leave them in their glory,
but my curiosity
was too strong to be denied it,
and I went so I could see.
Her cavern lay before their army
of two dozen half-crazed monks.
I hesitated for a moment,
then I followed where they slunk.
I saw their skillful, silent passage
through the darkened tunnel-way.
The first one fell into a pitfall
filled with molded spikes of clay!
Not a single sound he uttered,
though his pain was plain to see!
When we reached the dragon’s shelter,
they were down to ten and three!
Then, in silence full of furor,
all of them attacked as one!
Weapons glistened on her armor—
Spears and staves about her danced!
She awoke in storming anger,
lashing out with sharpened claw;
Monks were shaken, bruised and battered—
One was hanging from her maw!
Horror filled me as they battled;
Body parts were strewn about;
Still the monks would not surrender,
dwindling without a shout!
Then the dragon roared in anger,
rearing back its mighty head;
Then I saw her lunging forward,
falling as if she were dead!
I sought to find a wound or reason
that had caused her quick demise,
and I saw it in her belly,
just above her massive thigh:
A spear had buried in her gullet,
struck her heart a fatal blow;
As she fell, the monk who struck it
had been sadly crushed below.
Death and blood were strewn about me;
No one else remained alive;
The monks had died in silent glory
as they took the dragon’s life!
For a moment full of silence,
I looked on the carnage there;
Then I shrugged and started searching
for the dragon’s treasure trove!
Randolph Weaving Fingers finished,
dropped the harp, and disappeared!
Then another apparition
made its way among the bards.
He was bedecked in dented plate,
and broken shield and sword;
When he spoke, his voice rang out
deep and bold and strong!
Hold! Hold! Hold them back!
Keep your men from running!
Hold! Hold! Hold them back!
The enemy is coming!
Guard your flanks! Watch your back!
Aim with steady finger!
Kill the bastards who attack!
Kill them all for King Ur!
This is the chorus that was sung
upon the battlefield,
by the haggard warriors when
King Ur refused to yield!
They stood their ground with pike and sword
in mud and bloody bodies,
waiting for the great attack
of King Curry’s armies.
Days went past, the hour came,
and hunger fed their bellies;
Then they saw, upon the ridge,
the flag of Curry’s army!
Hold! Hold! Hold them back!
Keep your men from running!
Hold! Hold! Hold them back!
The enemy is coming!
Guard your flanks! Watch your back!
Aim with steady finger!
Kill the bastards who attack!
Kill them all for King Ur!
First the arrows filled the air
and landed without mercy;
Then the rush of man and beast
from King Curry’s army!
Good King Ur would not retreat;
They waited for the skirmish;
King Curry’s men saw them there
and came on without worries!
Halfway down the valley’s rim,
King Curry’s army waited;
Arrows filled the air again
with volleys unabated!
Hold! Hold! Hold them back!
Keep your men from running!
Hold! Hold! Hold them back!
The enemy is coming!
Guard your flanks! Watch your back!
Aim with steady finger!
Kill the bastards who attack!
Kill them all for King Ur!
Good King Ur declared retreat
and moved his army backward;
Onward came King Curry’s men,
marching ever onward!
Arrows would not fly again;
Archers stumbled forward,
falling down the muddy slope
that King Ur had covered!
With the order he had sent,
the trap was built and hidden;
Unbeknownst to Curry’s men,
the archers had been stricken!
Soon the word was passed around
from Good King Ur to others,
and his army made their way
around the pitfalls’ borders!
Hold! Hold! Hold them back!
Keep your men from running!
Hold! Hold! Hold them back!
The enemy is coming!
Guard your flanks! Watch your back!
Aim with steady finger!
Kill the bastards who attack!
Kill them all for King Ur!
The rush was made and soundly blocked
as battle waged eternal;
When the carnage broke at last,
King Curry won his funeral!
Good Kind Ur, the war’s victor,
went through his tattered army
telling them that he was proud
of beating Curry’s army!
Quickly heard throughout the ranks,
the battle cry erupted;
Good King Ur, it has been said,
was struck by tears of love that
he was shedding for the fallen
and the living wounded;
All the men who saw this feat
would leave there most astounded!
Hold! Hold! Hold them back!
Keep your men from running!
Hold! Hold! Hold them back!
The enemy is coming!
Guard your flanks! Watch your back!
Aim with steady finger!
Kill the bastards who attack!
Kill them all for King Ur!
Hold! Hold! Hold them back!
Keep your men from running!
Hold! Hold! Hold them back!
The enemy is coming!
Guard your flanks! Watch your back!
Aim with steady finger!
Kill the bastards who attack!
Kill them all for King Ur!
As the strident echoes faded,
the balladeer did too!
Then another wandered in
to sing as if on cue:
That old clod has never sung
any song worth singing;
His repertoire has never sprung
the joy he should be bringing!
Battle hymns and ballads,
warfare glorified!
He was a morbid, boorish bard,
long before he died!
But die he did, and we were sad,
for none could take his place;
Enough of gloom! Let us be glad!
Put on a happy face!
It happened in the midst of summer;
Unexpectedly, it came!
A storm blew up, quite unnatural,
that bestowed a yellow rain!
Never had I seen such nonsense
as a yellow puddle deep
with the sun still shining brightly
on the giant yellow stream!
Not a warning had been given
ere the yellow rain appeared;
Not a cloud or peal of thunder—
The yellow rain was everywhere!
As quickly as the rain had started,
it fizzled to a drippy end!
Had this yellow rain departed?
Would it start to rain again?
Then I heard a sigh—loud and heavy—
coming from somewhere behind;
I turned to search the cloudless heavens—
and I saw a massive thigh!
No more yellow rain was coming;
No more tinkles from above;
For the giant I was watching
had decided he was done!
Looking quickly for a river
that was free of yellow rain,
I dove in and scrubbed with vigor
to remove the yellow stain!
Pausing for expected laughter,
finding that there would be none,
he resorted to another
brief refrain to get him some!
Come, now, fellows, that was funny—
Perfect low-brow humor that!
Lighten up! Enjoy the moment!
I will help you do just that!
I once frolicked with the faeries
in their magic faerie hall!
Perchance we need their faerie magic
to remove this dreadful pall!
With a playful bit of magic,
he brought forth a faerie storm!
They erupted from the shadows,
quickly taking shape and form!
Flitting this way, flitting that way,
they confused the dreadful scene;
All at once, they departed,
with a playful, impish scream!
In their wake, their anger risen,
Master Bards prepared to weave
all the spells that they had mastered
to make the apparitions leave!
Then the Master of the Masters
cried out in alarm:
“Where is he?!” he asked in fear:
His protégé was gone!
“I am here,” said his apprentice
as he moved into the ring;
“I have finished weaving magic:
Four songs did I bring!”
His mentor wrestled with emotions—
relief and anger, fear and rage—
“How could you—” he started, harshly, then 
demanded he explain!
“The test demanded I show magic;
Four songs I was told to sing;
The first was played to set the stage;
Then with magic, I could bring
“the bards who sang their favored songs—
Long-dead though they are—
Appeared as apparitions—
Although in truth they were
“mere projections of my mind
given solid form;
No ghosts were they! Their songs were mine!
Shall I sing three more?”
The Master of the Master Bards—
His mentor and his friend!—
Spoke for all the Master Bards:
“Your test is at an end.
“The magic that you have displayed,
The songs that you have sung;
Will be discussed when we debate
if you should be among
the ranks of all the Master Bards
or cast out from our ranks.”
Then he turned to face the others:
“Shall we take a break?”
The test concluded, decisions made,
Three Master Bards were named;
One there was they forced to leave:
The one who played the drums!
His skill was great, they all had said,
but not his humor spun;
The evil magic he had played
was of concern to some;
They told him he could try again,
when next they gathered here;
Ten more years he’d have to wait
to be a Master Bard.
He left without objection;
His mentor chose to stay;
For sixteen days they traded songs;
For sixteen days they played!
The meeting of the bards disbanded;
Sharing of the songs was done;
 The Master Bards took separate roads,
in small groups or alone;
His mentor led him to the road
that led back to his home,
then took his leave—this time for good—
no longer would he roam.
He stayed but for a few days time
in his brother’s inn;
Then sought adventure one more time
as wanderlust set in!
Part 4
The night was dark beneath the sky;
the grass was tall and still;
The bard lay down for the night
atop a narrow hill;
He slept as deeply as he dared
but still not light enough;
They stole up from a shallow vale
and rummaged through his stuff;
They found the harp and plucked a string
that squawked into the night;
The bard awoke, alarmed, intense,
to see the strangest sight:
The creatures looked like human boys,
but only at first blush;
They stood no more than three feet high
with bodies built to crush;
“What are you?” the bard declared
as muscles held him tight;
“Leave my things alone!” he blared
beneath his captors’ might;
“We are dwarves,” said one of them,
his accent harsh as stone;
“What are you?” he countered back,
as if he didn’t know.
“I’m a man!” the bard replied,
his voice was filled with pride;
“Hey!” he cried in fear-filled rage
as they tossed his harp aside.
“Why?” The dwarf was curious.
“My harp—” the bard replied.
“Has value?” asked a bearded dwarf.
“Not much,” the bard denied.
“I play my music on it, dwarf,
It’s only value is to me.”
That was near enough to truth
the dwarf would ever see;
“Music?” A dwarf had found the wine.
“Song and wine?” the dwarf implored—
The other dwarves replied in kind;
The harp was brought before the bard,
“You will sing and play for us.”
How could the bard refuse?
They let him go and gathered ‘round;
his hands took up a tune;
He played a strident melody
and sung a boisterous song;
His gift to know his audience
had never proved him wrong.
The raucous strains of Angel’s Groom 
frolicked through the air
to land on eager dwarven ears
that fell into his snare!
He changed the tune with subtlety
to mold a lullaby
that sent the dwarves to peaceful sleep
beneath the darkened sky.
At last the final dwarf reposed;
at last their snores were heard;
Except for one that feigned his sleep
and tricked the tricky bard!
As the bard retrieved his things,
a melody was played
upon a flute of tender pitch
so delicately made;
The tune regaled the lullaby
the bard had just employed;
He turned to see a flautist dwarf
that left him most annoyed;
The bard declared, “It isn’t done!
No songs unshared are stole!”
The dwarven bard—for which he was—
said, “So I have been told.”
He raised the flute to mouth once more
and kicked a dwarf awake;
He played a melody (of sorts)
the bard could not forsake;
The dwarven duo sang and played
a song so strange it hurt
And then the dwarven bard reached down
to grab a fist of dirt;
The dirt was flung into the air 
and glowed a golden hue;
It hung, alone, above the ground,
and then the dwarf said, “You?”
The bard went deep inside his mind
and felt the song return;
He played the notes and formed the words;
His bardic power burned;
The dirt went flying in the air
and turned a rugged red;
It circled like a comet’s tail
about his weary head.
The dwarves were gone, but not the song;
it lay within his mind;
He thanked the dwarven bard he’d met 
for leaving it behind;
His gear was gone—at least in part—
but he was not upset;
He packed the things that still remained
and sighed with some regret:
What other songs they might have shared,
this dwarven bard and he,
would surely build upon his fame
and bardic mastery!
At last he sighed and lay back down
to dream of things unreal
and made himself the greatest bard
that dreamland could reveal.…
The morning brought the scent of rain;
by noon, the bard was soaked;
He stood his horse on muddy ground
beneath a withered oak;
He rested while the rain increased 
and wished he had some wine;
The dwarves had drunk their fill of it
and left no drop behind.
At last the weather broke in two,
the clouds divorced the sky,
The sun shone down on misty wood
as if it were an eye;
“Look” it seemed to whisper out,
“See what I can see?
The forest grows, my little bard,
around this sacred tree!”
The bard got lost in tangled webs 
of purest fantasy
until a windy voice broke up
his soggy reverie.
The leaves had shaken all at once;
the branches bent and swayed;
The raindrops scattered to the ground;
his horse had run away;
“Hmmm,” the deep, sonorous tone
seemed like a heavy sigh;
The bard had thought he was alone
in his weary plight;
“Ah! I see,” the voice went on,
“A little manly thing!
It’s been a goodly many years
since last your visiting!”
The earth began to shake and stir;
the mud began to fly;
The tree bent down to touch the ground
and gave a friendly sigh;
“My name is Yurp,” the treetop sang
like rustles on the wind;
“And who are you that comes my way,
my new-found little friend?”
The bard looked on with wondrous gaze
upon the oaken trunk;
It held a dozen knotty eyes
that gleamed with sappy gunk;
“My name is unimportant, Yurp,
I’m just a lowly bard;
I play upon my trusted harp,
and measure out my words.”
He knew he’d stretched the rhyme a bit,
but who would ever know?
Besides, a bard was given leave
to stretch a word or note.
“A bard, you say? Unimportant?
Who measures out a word?
What is that, my little friend?
I know not of this bard.”
The bard let out a toothy grin 
and gave a graceful bow,
“Let me play my harp for you
and sing my wares aloud!”
He freed his harp from leather case
and plucked to check its tune,
“The song I’ll sing is one I love,
it’s called Clarise’s Bloom.”
The notes were swift and light of air;
He danced a little jig;
He turned his body in the air
and sang as if a kid:
Clarise was a maid,
a maid of Inverness;
She wasn’t very old,
but old enough, I guess!
She liked the peasant boys,
but one she liked the best;
and brought him candied treats
She’d sneak out in her dress.
The candy that she brought
had melted on her breast
She let the peasant lick it off
And lifted up her dress;
The peasant boy was not too bright
but had experience,
and so he knelt on bended knee
to taste of other flesh;
He didn’t like the flavor, though;
It smelled of bitterness
But when he saw the cherry stem,
his will could not resist!
“Oh,” he chortled gleefully,
“My lovely virginess,
I’ll pluck your flower swift and true
for you, my dear Clarise!”
She squealed at first but not for long;
He passed her false defense;
She didn’t know he lacked in skill,
And he did not confess;
He plucked her flower from the vine
with too much eagerness,
and she let out a horrid scream 
that woke her governess;
He fled before he got the sword
and left her in a mess;
She lost her maiden-head that night
and gained a baby’s dress;
The flower grew to bear some fruit,
much to her distress,
and so she fled into the hills
around Keep Inverness.
The bard betrayed some ill-at-ease
when Yurp did not respond;
He had expected laughter from
the silly rhyme he’d sprung;
Perhaps he should have sung a tune
that focused on a tree,
But, lo! Behold! He had no song
that he could duly sing.
Shortly after he had stopped,
Yurp looked down, stretched, and stood,
“My apologies, my new-found friend,
that wasn’t very good;
“Granted I am not so keen
on habits of young men,
but I have heard some others sing
with much more skill, my friend;”
The bard was taken quite aback—
Then further back he went—
He bowed down low and softly said,
“I’m sorry, Master Yurp.”
On that sad note, he went away
and found a muddy track
Soon he’d sing to men, again—
for which he had a knack.
It took three days of gloominess—
both weather and his mood—
Before he came upon the town
outside of Sheltered Wood.
He found the Inn of Corded Wood
and sat with ease at last;
He didn’t want to sing at first,
but word had spread too fast;
With wine and urgings from the folk,
he reluctantly agreed
to sing some songs for all of them
and sat with practiced ease;
He cleared his throat and strummed some chords
and eyed the gathered throng;
His voice was sure and strongly set
as he began his songs:
The secret life of Jeban Da,
The past of Grim DeFleece,
The Honor Guard of Hobart’s Claw,
and Widow Aster’s Feast.
These songs are sung from time to time
by bards who bear the right,
and I shall sing them, one by one, 
for all of you tonight.
We’ll start with Widow Aster’s Feast, 
and then move on from there.
The mood was struck by languished note
of morbid, dark despair.
The day began with drastic news:
The King lay in his bed;
At least his body still reposed,
but not his royal head!
The queen had risen with the dawn
while King and court still slept;
She poised above her royal mate
and not a tear she wept;
Her hands were strong and gripped the sword
and raised it in the air;
The downward stroke was keenly aimed 
with utmost loving care;
The King lay still; his head did not; 
it rolled onto the floor
and bounced about with mocking grin
until it reached the door.
The Queen was cold but felt no fear,
no grief or false remorse;
She plucked the head up by the hair
and, triumphantly, she cursed:
“If only I had done this deed
so many years ago;
I would not have felt such loathing need
to let my anger go!”
She laughed insanely for a time
and hid the head from sight
before she called the royal guard
to see his royal plight!
“Oh! My King! He yet does sleep
that long, eternal rest!
We must not tarry! We dare not dally!
Today, we’ll have a feast!”
The men, of course, were not too keen
to celebrate his death,
but when they saw the Queen insane,
not one exhaled his breath.
The feast was soon prepared with haste,
the Queen was bright with cheer;
She danced and sang with earnestness
until the morning neared;
And then she left to soon return
to call the feasters near;
When all were looking at the Queen—
Her gaze was crystal clear—
She said, “My friends of noble birth,
my husband now is dead,
but here I have his final gift:
I give to you his head!”
He paused amid a string of notes
to give them room to breathe,
and then he struck a sorrowed chord
that almost made them grieve.
Alas, my friends, the Queen was lost;
her madness was complete;
The nobles of her royal court
stumbled to their feet;
In haste, they freed their crazy Queen
from life’s tormenting grasp;
A knife was thrust by drunken hands,
eliciting a gasp—
“What?!” the Queen demanded—loud—
as blood began to flow;
She died in fury, rage, and hate,
and cursed the fatal blow;
Her son, it was, whom justice brought,
through tears too feigned to see;
“I’m sorry,” was his whispered lie:
His plan would now succeed.
The Queen was not her purest self;
her mind was not her own;
She died within unloving arms;
The Prince let out a moan;
The herbs supplied in deepest night
had brought about the deed,
and now the Prince would have the throne
to satisfy his greed!
Poor Aster, Queen of Turish Gra,
poor Erlic, King of same;
Poor Turin, Prince whose soulless plan
had driven her insane;
He held the throne for two short years,
then lost his head, as well,
when peasants stormed the palace gates
and sent him straight to hell.
The sternness of the bard’s sweet voice
held warning for them all:
If they were taken in by greed,
then by greed they’d fall!
His voice was husky as he chirruped,
“More wine to soothe my tongue!”
And when he’d drunk a hefty draught,
his fingers had begun;
“My friends,” he said, in hollow voice, 
“I once was given leave
To hear a most uncommon tale
I still do not believe:
The tale began one foggy night
in some forgotten inn
when I encountered Jeban Da,
an old, decrepit man.
He moved on rusty-hinges legs
from armor ages old
and sat with such a heavy sigh
his story must be told;
I ordered wine for he and I
and lent to him my ear,
then listened to the strangest tale
that I would ever hear.
“How old am I?” He asked of me,
“Sixty-nine?” I said;
He chuckled wryly for a time
and softly shook his head;
“Thank ye kindly for the jest,
but I have seen far more;
One thousand six—or thereabouts—
give or take a score.”
There was no hint of humor in
those weary, golden eyes;
He whispered softly, more than sad,
“If only I could die.”
“You see, I’ve lived beyond my years—
indeed, beyond yours too—
And all the people that I’ve known
are dead—except for you.”
A touch of fear began to creep 
from spine to quivered flesh,
but he continued to repeat
his fervent wish for death;
“One thousand times have I been slain,
one thousand times I’ve died;
But always, always, do I rise
hale once more inside;
“I’ve lived through battles none survived
and felt assassin’s blades;
I’ve fed so many beasts of prey—
and yet I am unscathed;
“I’ve witnessed miracles, my friend,
and acts of evil mien;
and through them all, I lived, I died,
again, and yet, again.”
He sighed so soft I barely heard
then shrugged the eerie mood;
“Do you wish to live forever?”
Then, I understood.
“I stole my way upon the lair
of Dragon-Keeper’s Sky,
and found a magic wishing well
and wished I’d never die;
“My wish was granted—this I know—
for soon, the Keepers came,
and I was captured by the men
and tortured past insane;
“They’d kill me in some fiendish way
through torture, pain, and woe,
and I’d return to wretched life,
which they would sunder low;
“Oh! The methods they devised
to test their skill and luck!
And so it went for untold years
until The Woodsmen struck.
“They came at night—or so I’m told—
and slew the Keeper’s men,
But when they found the dungeon cells,
I was dead again.
“They set me on a funeral pyre
and burned my flesh and bone,
but I returned to life, once more,
and found myself alone;
“I wandered, free, a hundred years, 
and watched my body fade;
But when I died an ancient man,
my body was remade—
“I lived again, a youthful man,
of barely twenty-three;
And wandered through the lands once more
with hopes to be set free.
“Eternity is far too long
for any man to bear;
I know this for a fact of life;
I’m on my way to there.”
With those deep-set, golden eyes,
he held me in his gaze,
“Tonight, again, I’ll die once more
to wake in younger days.”
His eyes grew dark and free of life,
his body slumped and fell;
I prayed to all the gods I know
to rest his troubled soul;
But as I watched his lifeless corpse,
it shimmered like a dream;
And when it settled down once more,
a youthful face was seen!
His music died and silence fell
to linger in the room,
and then he played a solemn note
that stank of coming doom.
He rose from death to smirk at me
and clapped his hands with glee;
“Hello, Uncle!” he chortled out,
“Never fear! It’s just me!”
The music changed to impish pace,
his tone became a lark
As he resumed the final verse
with voice no longer dark;
I sternly glared before I laughed,
then gracefully, I bowed;
“A clever jest,” I said in praise.
“I’ll get you back,” I vowed.
He’d drawn them in the clever tune
and laughter fluttered free;
He drank more wine to whet his voice
then played a melody;
Its pattern wove a tangled web
of humor laced with cheer,
And then he sung the whispered words
that made them strain to hear:
His name I shouldn’t tell you;
His crime you soon will know;
His hair was crinkled like a sheep
and colored white as snow!
Today, I’ll call him Grim DeFleece;
Tomorrow? Who can say?
He walked among the sheep at night 
and lay with them by day!
His father left him busy;
His sisters left him pure;
The sheep were somewhat leery, though,
for reasons left obscure!
He loved his ewes with pleasure;
He loved his rams as well;
But when he saw his special lambs
his heart would firmly swell!
The sheep were more than nervous;
The wolves were kept at bay;
The boy was said to have the gift
that kept those beasts away!
The day we met was shaggy;
The night we shared, unsure;
The sheep were bleating skittishly—
a sound almost demure!
I witnessed something tainted;
I saw it all that night;
What it was I will not say,
but surely it’s not right!
The morning came at midday;
The dawn returned at dusk;
The dour face of Grim DeFleece
had fallen gray as dust!
His father sent a message:
Today, the sheep would sell;
He gathered up the rams and ewes
to take them to the well.
The lambs, of course, had followed,
as sheep are wont to do,
and all were cut for butcher’s meat
or sold for mutton stew!
The shepherd’s son was dismal,
as if his love had died,
and all that night he lay awake
and cried and cried and cried!
Here he paused to build effect
and changed the tune once more;
A solemn beat resumed the song
with humor in the score;
I tried my best to comfort him;
I tried to ease his pain;
But when he got a bit too close,
I crushed him once again!
He bleated like a broken sheep;
He fled as horror-struck;
I fled, as well, away from him
and praised the God of Luck!
A few more lively chords were played
to end his comic song
And then he sought the outhouse door—
the night was getting on;
A brief respite to eat some food
and drink some heady wine,
and then he’d finish out the night
and leave the town behind.
The Honor Guard of Hobart’s Claw
is one you all should know,
Written by an ancient bard
whose name was never known;
I met my mentor late one fall
When I was very young;
I grew convinced a bard I’d be
with every song he sung;
He taught me all the basic chords
and how to scan a rhyme
But, most of all he showed me how
to keep in perfect time;
The winter faded into spring;
his wanderlust returned;
I’d come to love him like a friend
and felt my passion burn;
I begged and pleaded days-on-end
for him to teach me more,
and then, at last, he cursed my soul
and gave to me this score:
The melody was simply strung,
the pace was slow and firm,
He gazed into the distant past
with old eyes, soft and worn.
A witch was drawn and quartered;
Her curse was fiercely thrown;
The king would die a dismal death
that none had ever known.
She died without repenting;
The king was furious;
The Priest of Onus came to prey
and left with many purses.
The thief was given penance—
A hand was all it took!—
but, after they had cut it off,
They let him have it back!
A thief whose hand is missing;
A witch whose curse was thrown;
The pattern of the king’s demise,
like wheat, was slowly sown.
When Hobart left the city,
He went to Onus’ shrine
and prayed for vengeance on the ones
who punished such a crime;
He’d only stolen money—
and not that much at that!
What right had they to do this deed?
He cleared his throat and spat;
Onus is an ornery god;
His follower was heard;
The hand was thrust in open flame;
Its flesh was quickly charred;
The bones were black with soot;
The flesh had burned away;
Hobart knew what he must do
to make the bastards pay!
Hobart sought an evil witch
and bought an evil spell;
He took it to the royal court
and sent his judge to hell!
The magistrate was drinking;
The king was telling jokes;
The feast was strong and lively
for all the royal folks;
The Hand of Hobart entered;
its fingers stalked the floor;
It leapt upon the magistrate
and squeezed with magic force;
He choked and sputtered madly;
He tried to breathe and failed;
The king was horrified, of course, 
and watched the spectacle;
The hand released its victim
and dropped as lifeless limb;
The king called for the royal guard,
and they came rushing in;
The hand was tried for murder—
Its guilt was guaranteed—
The royal guard and royal court
appeased the nervous king!
The execution folly
embarrassed all who came;
The king was now a sorry joke
And laughter was his fame!
The curse had called for vengeance;
The king was bound to die;
The final blow would come at last 
in every peasant’s eye;
The king was gently coddled;
His rule became obtuse;
His orders fell on deafened ears,
until he asked, “What’s the use?”
He hung his head in sorrow;
The hand had done him in;
He became the laughing stock
throughout his vast kingdom!
The day approached with fervor;
the time had come at last;
The king decreed his mental state
was lost amid the past;
His last request was followed—
in jest or pity’s sake?
He ordered all to send away
the life he couldn’t take.
A royal feast was gathered;
The peasants ushered in;
They ate the feast that was prepared
and walked back out again;
The courtyard filled with peasants;
Each brought a throwing stone;
The king stood in their circled midst
and all the rocks were thrown!
The smile on his dying face
put tears in many eyes,
but none were shed by Onus’ Priests,
who watched with no surprise;
Vengeance had been mollified;
The curse had been fulfilled;
The tragic death the king decreed
had left the peasants chilled;
The court was thrown in shambles;
No king could be proclaimed;
A dozen years of kingless rule
before one could be named!
The cousins didn’t want it;
The courtesans refused;
His children weren’t legitimate
and others were excused!
At last, a family member,
who’d drunk more than he should,
Proclaimed himself the rightful heir
and all said that he could!
The crown was thrust upon him;
The throne became his chair;
The curse befell their newfound king,
and he lost all his hair!
His sanity was questioned;
The doubts were softly said;
That king was called the Restless King:
In three months, he was dead.
The kingdom fell to chaos;
No rulers could be found;
The peasants flourished in their midst,
and so did every town!
Alas, the land was conquered;
Too many people died;
All because a witch’s curse
and Onus’ Priest’s combined!
His voice had gotten weary;
he played a few more notes;
He set his harp upon the floor
and rested while he spoke:
My friends, my stay has brought me joy;
I hope the songs I’ve sung
Have given you a brief respite
from the chill this day has sprung;
But, now that spring’s upon us,
I fear I must depart;
I long to go exploring—
although it breaks my heart.
The morn will find me leaving;
The night will find me gone;
But I will take you with me,
although I go alone!
He idly strummed some wayward notes
and tweaked a weary grin.
They begged him to continue on—
Reluctantly, he gave in.
This ballad plagues me to this day;
It sorrows me to tears;
It came to me one weary trade
in my younger years;
The bard who sang it was a eunuch
for the Queen of Sespetune;
His voice was lovely, filled with beauty,
holding to a tenor’s croon;
As he sung his tortured ballad,
with his lilting, boyish voice,
my heart grew heavy, cold and sad;
He sang with such remorse!
“Dunkirk soared the skies above
on wings of burgundy,
and then he dove with subtle flair
and perfect majesty;
“His aim was sure as archer’s bow;
It took him to his prey;
His talons struck with sword-like force
to steal the life away!
“His grip was firm as armored glove
and delicate as lace;
As he took flight, once again,
he climbed with haunting grace;
“He flew to me on tender wing
and landed on my wrist;
I took the rabbit from his claw 
and sang with earnestness:
‘My lovely Dunkirk, I thank you
for sharing this with me!
I shan’t partake of it until
you’ve had your fill to eat!’
“He ate a slice of rabbit flesh
as if he were a king;
I set him on his wooden perch
and cooked the rest for me.
“We travelled on for quite some time
through rolling hills of grass;
I sang the ballads I had brought
to help the time to pass;
“A strangled squawk from Dunkirk came
behind a solid THUMP!
He fell in limpest, stillest form—
A dead, unmoving clump!
“I hesitated, lost and numb,
until the men approached;
I stared where Dunkirk had been struck—
His neck and wing were broke!
“The men were unaware of him;
I could see no more;
They dragged me from my startled steed
and rumpled through my gear;
“They took the coin that I had won
with songs a king could hear!
They took my steed and ate my food
and stole my battle gear!
“They gave me back my wounded harp,
whose strings they snapped in two;
I did naught to stay their hands—
What else was I to do?
“Then they left me standing there—
Alone with Dunkirk dead—
I vowed to Onus—and He heard!—
That I would have their heads!
“It took me many moons to plan
the vengeance that I sought,
but when it came, I was prepared,
and this is what I wrought:
“I sang a song with magic words
and built the imagery;
I turned the leader of the men
into a bird of prey!
“His body shifted painfully—
I relished every scream!
The feathers came through beautifully—
Golden sunlit beams!
“The brilliance of the gold he sought
was finally his to wear,
and he replaced what I had lost
as Dunkirk’s tragic heir!
“His flight was awkward to the eye;
His hunting skills were none;
And yet, I knew, he would replace,
my friend that he had wronged!
“He flew with me for many months,
and then an arrow came;
The archer disappeared too soon
for me to learn his name.
“So when they ask me of my bird
with feathers steeped in tea,
I tell them all my blackbird’s name
is simply Mystery!
“This ballad tells a simple tale
of birds of prey and men,
and how, with magic in our midst,
there is no gap between!
“But what of Dunkirk, first to be?
My bird of prey and friend?
He and I were travelling:
Two mercenary men!
“But in a tangled battle of
a war two kings had waged,
Dunkirk caught a magic spell
hurled by a mage;
“It changed him to bird of prey
of richest burgundy,
and I avowed to find a cure—
which wasn’t meant to be.
“The spell the mage had struck him with
also touched my harp;
When I sing a certain song,
his magic will erupt;
“It works its way with brutal force
from deep within my soul,
until I must unleash it all
in one melodic throw—
“I use this spell with utmost care—
sometimes it will fail—
For I am not a magic-man
who understands it well!”
He played a few more subtle notes
and set his harp aside;
He rose to leave, collected coins
and made his way outside.…
Epilogue
Three days later, all alone,
atop a swollen rise;
He cowered, panting, on the run
against a chilling sight;
He took out harp;
Began to play—
Would it keep
the beasts at bay?
He struck the chords
as they closed in,
composed the lyrics,
and began to sing:
Ensconced in armor wrought from flame
with swords of molten stone,
the warriors came upon the scene
in search of flesh and bone;
They left a trail of smoking earth
and stared with eyes aglow;
Their feral grins and rancid howls
were all we had to know;
We fled like dogs from cracking whips
as fear entombed us all
and prayed to gods that no one knew 
that we would never fall;
But Rastus did and broke his leg;
We left him for dead;
His wretched screams pursue us still
and fill us all with dread!
At length our bodies failed us all,
as one by one we fell;
The monsters stalked unerringly,
those wretched beasts from hell!
All but me, the last who’s left,
witness to their acts,
but not for long, since they are near
and soon they will attack!
The smell of smoke surrounds me now;
No coward though am I!
The only thing that keeps me sane
is singing my next rhyme!
Their claws are cold and burn li—
Other Poems
A Visit to Valhalla
Odin came to me one night
to offer me a deal,
an eight-legged pony ride
to Valhalla for a meal.
In exchange for such a treat,
he didn’t ask for much:
Just my worship given free
for His godly touch.
You might think it rather odd
to see Him standing there,
But I’d studied Him so long,
I didn’t really care
if what I saw was really there
or just some crazy dream,
and so I said to Him, “Why not?”
to see what I could see.
He nodded once with slight incline
then whistled loud and shrill;
A cloud-rimmed portal opened up,
and He made good our deal.
From the portal’s writhing mass,
there stepped a wondrous beast,
an eight-legged brackish steed
to take me to my feast.
He whispered softly in its ear;
It bobbed its lovely head,
then came to nuzzle up to me:
“Climb inside,” it said.
I didn’t understand at first
what mighty Sleipnir meant,
but looking closer I espied
a sight I won't forget:
The horse’s back was not at all
what I had thought to find;
Inside it was a coffin-stall:
its head-stone’s name was mine.
It was then I knew for sure
that this was not a dream;
Odin stood before my eyes
in our reality!
My steed’s impatience came to bear;
It nudged me with its nose;
I gently climbed inside its chest;
the coffin-lid slid closed.
You do not know what terror is
until you’ve been entombed
inside a horse from ancient myth
in unenlightened gloom.
A darkness deeper than the sea
collapsed about my form
but opened momentarily
as if I'd been reborn.
I found myself inside a room–-
the horse was quick away–-
with proper clothes and tools to groom
my beard of pepper-gray.
The mirror (too ornately made)
showed me who I am:
With helmet, shield, and unsheathed blade,
a striking Viking man!
I stood and stared in solitude
as moments came and passed,
then Odin came into my room
to see to my repast.
He guided me through ancient halls
and past fine tapestries
depicting battles, Viking ships,
and cities under siege;
He led me to an angled room
whose walls were far away
and seated me beside his throne
and told me not to stray;
The floor was wide and empty;
Where was the Viking throng?
A moment later, Loki came
with merriment and song:
“Thor, the son of Odin,
that store-bought hammerhead
is chasing in that dreadful boar,
so we can all be fed;
“But just in case the boar might win,
there is no need to fret,
for Loki is a warrior, too-– 
though some of you forget.
“I've borrowed several odds and ends
from friends and foe alike,
in case I need to steal the scene
and enter in the fight.”
There came a yell of utmost rage,
as only gods might make;
Thor thundered through the entryway
on clouds of lightning blaze.
Loki chortled gleefully
and danced about the floor,
then tossed Thor’s hammer playfully
until there came The Boar.
The Boar was growling rabidly
and bounced with malice due,
but Thor fought on relentlessly
as weapons broke in two;
“The God of Thunder met his match
without the slightest pause,
and Loki, God of Mischief,
is surely not the cause!
“Do not blame your brother god
for finding what you lost;
I toss it now to your hand—”
and with those words, he paused.
Loki threw the Hammer true:
It sparkled in its arc
and landed firmly in Thor’s hand,
and soon it found its mark.
The boar was struck between the eyes
and staggered to its knees;
A second blow was all it took
to slay the massive beast.
“By the gods,” I muttered in dismay -–
then chuckled to myself:
Those gods were all about me now
in Valhalla's dale.
Loki turned to gaze on me—
a mirthless, brutal stare—
what courage that I still possessed
deserted me right there.
Then he smiled sweetly down
and honey from him oozed,
“What’s this?” he posed with earnest frown
that slithered and confused:
“A little man of living flesh
whose beating heart yet bleeds?
To visit Asgard for a time—
Will Odin lets him leave?”
Odin’s tone would brook no threat
as He replied in kind –
“He's my guest throughout the feast –
keep it close in mind!”
Loki’s face was much alive,
dancing with his thoughts;
I wondered if he might defy
the orders Odin wrought;
And then He smiled fiendishly
and from his lips there came
an offer to beguile me
with sights I’ve never seen:
“Shall we go to Jotunheim,
where the Giants are?
There are mountains you can climb,
but I doubt you’d get too far;
“The Giants like it none-at-all
when strangers come their way,
and if by chance you fail to fall,
they’ll push you anyway.”
I realized that he spoke to me
and Odin didn’t mind;
I finally found a voice to use
and squawked, “I must decline.”
Loki seemed a bit put off
but not for very long:
He found a seat of blackest stone
and whistled private songs.
The boar was butchered where it lay
and quickly sent to roast;
Flagons full of amber mead
were brought in for a toast;
But just before the flagons’ loft
there came into the hall
another god I recognized:
Tyr, the God of war.
The legends say he lost his hand
when Fenris bit it off,
but I hadn’t realized that
the bleeding never stopped;
It dripped and oozed from open wounds 
of ragged, shredded flesh
and left a trail of spattered sound
with every godly step.
He wore the wound with stoic pride
and purest bravery –-
and came to sit at Odin’s side
with godlike majesty.
The flagons raised in unison
as Odin’s voice rang out;
A million voices echoing
one resounding shout.
I hadn’t seen them saunter in
with all these gods around,
But listened to their festive mood
as flagons were slammed down.
I joined in the revelry
and drank my fill of wine;
I ate of many wondrous foods
that helped to ease my mind.
Thor and Odin spoke of things
while Loki listened in;
I couldn’t understand their words:
they weren’t for mortal men.
Tyr, I noticed, seldom spoke
except when spoken to;
He sat in silence, like a stone,
and nibbled at his food.
Sometime in the midnight hour,
I drank one flagon more
and tumbled from my hero's perch
and passed out on the floor.
I woke in piercing darkness,
drenched in sticky sweat;
Once again, I was at home
in my double bed.
I lay in panic for a time,
but not for very long;
The memories came creeping back 
like sluggish, drunken song;
It took some time to sort them out -–
Was it real or just a dream?
One image I could not deny
was Odin’s one-eyed gleam:
It held within its omni-stare
a hope of things to come,
a resurrection of the gods
of mighty Viking men.
I finally shrugged it all away—
It must have been a dream—
But all that night I lay awake
beneath His one-eyed gleam.
When the morning sun arose
to race across the sky,
a jaunty ray of sunshine chose
to dance on Odin’s eye:
The statue seemed to match the gleam
and I could not deny
that it was shining on the patch 
above his absent eye!
There is another tidbit
that I have yet to tell:
My visit to Valhalla
ended up in Hel!
I won’t describe the things I saw,
the grotesque misery,
but will repeat what Odin said,
spoken just for me:
“This is where the liars go
and those unfit to wear
the pride of Viking sword and shield
and robust Viking beard!
“A promise made had best be kept
until your dying day,
or here is where you will be sent
for endless suffering.”
Then he roughly brushed my brow;
I fell down in a daze;
I woke up next inside my room
beneath his one-eyed gaze.
I fully realized what I’d done
and what I must now do:
My worship to Him has begun
and always will be true!
Bloodlines
An evil moon shines down on me,
hinting of things to come,
concealing horrid memories
of the devil’s work that I have done;
Fangs unsheathed of canine teeth
and hair that’s lost control;
A madman’s lust for human blood,
unfettered by a soul;
I seek to sate my sudden need
with the first I come across;
I sink in deeply with my teeth,
ensuring that no blood is lost;
I rip and tear and rend with claw
while shreds of flesh surrender
to the rabid beast in me
that tastes the fresh blood of her;
Her screaming falls on eager ears;
Her blood goes racing faster;
Until the final scream cuts off—
I’ve sucked my lifeblood from her;
The blood is sweet as nectar’s breath
dancing on my tongue;
It trickles down my swollen throat—
too soon, the meal is done;
I revel in the luxury 
of the massive high I feel,
but only for a moment’s breath
that makes it seem surreal;
I flee the scene that I have made
and find my way to home,
where I sit and ponder on
the dreadful deed I’ve done;
With the passing of the rush,
the fix’s potency,
I feel deflated, all at once,
and ease off into sleep;
I wake with blood dried on my chin,
no wound from which it flowed;
A rancid taste is in my mouth
that makes me gag and choke;
I cleanse myself as best I can,
discard my tattered skin;
I stare into the empty glass
at what I’ve always been;
I wonder if I’ll ever die—
Will peace for me be found?
The tears go slipping from my eyes
and fall without a sound;
Who will come to slit my throat?
Or plunge into my heart
a weapon made with finest skill
from simple, silver start?
Until that day, I sit and pray
with eerie dreams of death
and steal the sickened souls of life
that cling to barest breath;
I let their tainted blood to flow
to slake my endless thirst,
for finding where my next hit is
is always what comes first.…
Best Laid Plans
The bottles all were empty,
the fluid had been spilled;
The mice were licking up the drops
around the broken still;
My eyesight had gone blurry,
and I could barely see;
The mice were growing way too fast,
way too fast for me!
I’d studied through the journal
with caution and with care,
Assembled all the alchemy,
but I was unaware—
The title of the journal—
I hadn’t thought it true—
But I found out way too late,
as mice about me grew;
The cats were all in trouble—
The mice had grown so fast—
There was no hope that I could see—
Would the serum last?
The mice had more than trebled—
some as large as dogs—
But the biggest ones I ever saw
would rival even hogs!
When the mice had left me;
when I was all alone;
I cleaned up my equipment
and burned that wicked tome.
If you don’t believe me,
I will understand,
But if you do, I beg of you:
be careful what you plan!

Have you ever heard of Moxy?
Or the words of Lexicon?
What of Medic with Apoxy
and the mighty Paragon?
They are heroes of the ages
spoken of with tragic note.
The greatest of the Sages,
Lord Encyclopedic, wrote:
“At his side was kindly Medic,
healer of the fallen men,
raising armies with his magic
by restoring life and limb;
“Their companion in this battle
was a finely spoken one;
He was often known to prattle,
did this wordsmith, Lexicon;
“Three in number were the fellows
who had sought Lord Paragon
to release him from The Bellows,
dungeon of The Burning Son;
“There they slew the evil dragon
that had captured Paragon
who had gone there on an errand
that was worthy of the man;
“Paragon had sought a treasure
stolen by The Burning Son
and returned with fullest measure
with the gift of truth he’d won;
“In the end, our heroes prospered –
Moxy, Medic, Lexicon –
They had freed our mighty master:
Truth was held in Paragon!”
Such it was and has been quoted
by the sages of our time;
Lord Encyclopedic wrote it –
perfect rhythm, perfect rhyme –
Now it’s time my song has ended
for my words are at a close;
Now my duty has been tended
for this circle’s bardic prose.
Payment in Full
The pouch of gold weighs heavily on me;
My thoughts are tangled in an evil spell;
If I do this, I never will be free,
And yet, I slowly creep in for the kill.
The voices sing and empty mugs are filled;
The King has joined in the revelry;
His voice is like a minstrel’s steady trill;
The pouch of gold weighs heavily on me.
I listen for a time in misery;
This indecision is a bitter swill;
I pledged to slay His Pompous Majesty;
My thoughts are tangled in an evil spell.
The jester starts to sing out loud and shrill,
in tones that ruffle every tapestry;
I make my choice, no longer feeling ill:
If I do this, I never would be free—
But what is freedom tinged by slavery?
A servant to a lord of evil will?
But, this assassin, I could never be,
and yet, I slowly creep in for the kill.
The knife is honed with mastery and skill;
The King is standing, swaying drunkenly;
I thrust the blade and feel his life-blood spill
and at my side there rests so heavily

A Ballade for the Peasantry
The trumpet bore a lingered tone
that floated to the valley’s core
and settled sadly in the loam,
delivering its painful chore.
The tone had come but once before
to tell the people to prepare
for chaos in the Noble court:
The King had died without an heir.
The King was scarce encased in stone
before there came a dreadful war;
So many craved the empty throne
that carnage ruled from shore to shore
and all the land was fiercely scored
by fires belching in the air,
and then the claimants numbered four.
The King had died without an heir.
The armies fought ‘til two, alone,
were strong enough to fight some more,
and when they met, it would be known
which claimant would become the lord
of all the Kingdom and the poor
and all the treasures that were there,
behind the sacred, vaulted door.
The King had died without an heir.
As was the case in days of yore,
too many died who didn’t care,
and all because the trumpet roared:
The King had died without an heir!
Conquest
It started when the King of Urlap died.
The line was split between the burly Prince
Dimitri and his cousin Ungar.  Love
of power dominated as each man
attempted to become the one to rule
the kingdom.  Enter:  the Dragon Lord.
It had been decades since the Dragon Lord
had brought his armies forth.  Some said he'd died,
so quiet he had been, but he still ruled
the Dragon Horde, waiting, watching, a prince
of darkest magic at his side.  No man
was he, this Dragon Lord:  He had no love
for man or elf or dwarf.  His only love
was magic: It would make him overlord
of all the lands, but, first, the lands of man
would fall.  So when the King of Urlap died,
he left his slumber and attacked.  The Prince
was well-prepared for battle, claimed his rule,
and stood his ground.  His cousin claimed to rule
as well but went to Urlap Keep.  His love
of life was strong; he sent for aid.  The Prince
of Elves, Ne'ween, despised the Dragon Lord
and came at once when told he hadn't died.
The battle for the world was fought by man
and elf and dragon in the lands of man.
The dwarves sat out; they had no need to rule
the upperworld.  So many thousands died;
their flesh and bones became a swamp with love-
less thickets, bloody pools.  The Dragon Lord
was met in battle by the Elvish Prince:
They fought with magic, sword, and bow. The Prince
was struck a mortal blow and fell.  A man—
his name is lost—then struck the Dragon Lord
a lucky, deadly thrust to end his evil rule.
The dragons fled.  Dimitri held no love
for Ungar, but was glad he hadn't died.
The Dragon Lord was slain.  The Elvish Prince
had died.  The balance was renewed, and man
returned to rule a world in need of love.
Bride Price
Embellished by an ornate seal,
The missive came by messenger;
It held her perfume’s strong appeal
but not the promise of dowry
that I had hoped I would procure
through clever words and gentle touch;
I read the missive to be sure 
the price of love was not too much.
If I accept their modest deal
to wed the Lady I adore
for such a trifling of weal,
I would admit my hearth is poor;
Although my love for her is pure—
This nonsense!  Oh!  It is as such
that I have grown a bit unsure:
Is the price of love too much?
This is an effortful ordeal
to court the Lady and implore
with earnestness and love and zeal
when I am far more insecure;
This marriage that I would secure;
This woman that I yearn to clutch;
I’ve sought to find a simple cure—
The price of love may be too much.
In answer to her missive’s lure,
I shall accept the simple hutch
and wed the lovely Guinevere:
The price of love is not too much.
The Maiden
The lovely maiden knelt upon the floor;
Her dress of white was thrown about her sides;
The tears and fears she knew had come before
To many other warriors’ would-be brides.
The battle would be waged upon a hill;
His army would be fighting for His cause;
She prayed and prayed that He would not be killed;
For if He was, her life would soon be lost.
For three long days she waited for the word;
When dust-clouds could be seen beyond the moor,
she hurried down the steps into the yard
where she had stood so many times before.
But when the army’s flag was drawing near,
She saw her lord in front, upon a bier.…
Old Harridan’s Ballade
The tone was deaf to Eros’ call,
but Ares heard its biting tongue;
He sent a warrior to the ball
to slay the beastly Harridan,
who tried to thwart her lover Grun
from wedding Hobart’s daughter Mae.
The havoc wreaked was havoc hung
upon the feast of Judgment Day.
The Warrior met the castle wall
and fought the castle guardian;
His sword was sharp, his stance was tall,
and all about were pieces flung.
(A piece or two had tightly clung!)
With sword agleam from battle’s fray,
the Warrior entered on the fun
upon the feast of Judgment Day.
The Warrior, dressed in blood and gall,
approached the Lordling and his son,
then passed them by to stroll the hall
while all about, the bards still sung
the might of Grun, the Lord of Dunn,
who sat upon his throne, a-sway,
and reveled in his glory, stunned,
upon the feast of Judgment Day.
His sword was swift to Justice-done;
The Warrior took his prize away;
The head of Harridan was strung
upon the feast of Judgment Day.
the crumbling statue
The ruins of the village is in tears,
and none but I can hear her weary cries;
Her forlorn whimpers cradled by the years
have mingled with my heavy-laden sighs.
Our solemn wailing settles like the night
and drapes the valley with a tender dirge;
We pine for those who faced the tragic blight
that all their efforts could not seem to purge.
The bones of all the dead are buried deep
in dust of ages lost to tempered steel;
The ghosts of peasants march like milling sheep
on crumpled stone. The village streets are still.
The ruins cry, but do not cry alone;
I am her humble seneschal of stone.
Burly Hank and Me
[1]
There is no brawling in the Ceptic Tank
between the sewer rats that dwell in there;
The owner of the pub is Burly Hank,
whose muscles bulge too much to be ignored.
It’s said he crushed the skull of Iron Jake
for swearing oaths on Burly Hank’s dead mum,
and when he caught a thief who tried to take
his money from the till, Hank ate his thumb.
I saw him fight a dozen men at once—
he didn’t even break out in a sweat—
I knew that I would never stand a chance
of winning any money from my bet.
And yet, I stood my ground and, eye-to-eye,
I said to Burly Hank, “Today, you’re mine.”
[2]
Now, Burly Hank is not a man to laugh,
so when I spoke those words, his eyes went blank
until a dry and rancid epithet
escaped between the lips of Burly Hank.
At first, I didn’t understand the sound,
despite the intent creeping in his eyes,
and then I found myself upon the ground
in time to dodge his massive, bulky thigh.
His gleeful chuckles sang out loud and clear
as clapping from the patrons joined in;
The chorus of his stomping drawing near
was like a dirge in twilight for a friend.
I clenched my teeth and flexed my brawny fist
and wondered how I would get out of this.
 [3]
I fought with all I had and then some more,
but all that I achieved was just a groan;
But as we battled on, this thing I swore:
If Burly Hank went down, I’d run for home!
I dodged until my face was turning red,
and swung until my arms were falling off,
then, just as I believed I’d soon be dead,
the mighty Burly Hank told me to stop.
Now, Burly Hank has honor for his soul
and honesty is marrow in his bones,
so I backed off and waited, dutiful,
as he sat down with muffled little moans.
He stared me in the eye with new respect:
“A draw?” he asked; I nodded – what the heck?
[4]
What happened next I could not understand:
The crowd had hushed to whispers dancing ‘round;
Then came a cry of “Burly Hank’s a sham!”
but it was quickly silenced by the crowd.
I drew a breath and glared with sternest eye;
My gravel voice broke through the Ceptic Tank;
“I challenge any man who will deny
the strength and skill of mighty Burly Hank
to show his face and say it to the man!”
The silence settled like a passing breeze.
and then the nervous crowd pushed out a man
who stumbled forth and fell down to his knees.
While Burly Hank just stared in pure contempt,
the foolish little man fell down and wept.
[5]
The sight was sickening for all to see,
but Burly Hank just nudged him with his toe,
and then he turned and winked his eye at me
to tell the little man that he could go.
He scampered off with groveling and bows—
appreciation showed with every move—
I know he’d learned to close his squeaky mouth,
but never will he learn to speak the truth.
So, Burly Hank and me, we shook our hands
and had our fill of wine and salty food;
We toasted through the night like new-found friends,
and in the morning didn’t feel so good.
That’s when I went to claim my wager won –
I’d bet that I would last until the dawn.
Tomb Raider
The darkness has covered my tracks – and my plan;
The Tomb of the Pharaoh is waiting for me;
I hasten to lever the stone from the door
and enter with lantern from which I will see.
The pitfalls and dangers I easily meet;
Too soon, I stand in the presence of God;
I push on the coffin to open the lid
and feel as though something is waiting inside.
I lift up the lantern the better to see;
A breeze comes from nowhere to blow out the flame;
The darkness is eerie, like death on the wing,
and I am regretting the reason I came.
The silence of ages still clings to the walls;
The scent of time passing still hangs in the air;
My moment of triumph has fallen down low,
and I whimper softly, “I’m sorry I’m here.”
My voice sends a shiver down hallway and spine,
Returning like clockwork on echoing time;
A teardrop and prayer I solemnly spend;
A voice in darkness responds: “You are mine.”
Abernathy’s Misfortune
I trudged through muck that crept up to my knees
and kept my eyes upon the starry night;
I felt a presence in the chilly breeze
and knew that something out there was in flight;
The screeching came from somewhere much too close;
Although I tried, I could not seem to run,
and then the odor tickled in my nose:
The haunting witch’s hour had begun!
The sucking of the clinging, muddy ground
was sending echoes through the eerie wood;
It seemed to shout to everything around:
“An idiot has come to be our food!”
A chuckle seemed to settle on my skin
before I felt its talons sinking in.…
Familiar Loss
When Abernathy met his strange demise,
I felt it as I would have felt my own:
The piercing talons gouging out his eyes
elicited much more than just a groan;
His psychic screams were loud and full of pain;
They rattled through my mind like broken glass;
I felt the creature striking out again
and went with him into the gray morass;
His screams turned into whispers on the wind
and faded slowly to a silent pall.
I felt his death and knew I’d lost a friend,
the closest, dearest friend among them all.
I crushed the tears that threatened to explode
and turned my full attention to the road.
The Summons*
Darkness, black with eerie fringe,
red and orange beneath me singe,
fiery hells surround the hinge,
and yet the door dost hold.
Arms akimbo, hands aflame,
no one speaks his hell-bent name
though they think it, just the same,
and yet the door dost hold.
Shadows flecked with bloody grime,
suspended thoughts in streams of time
anchored in a thing sublime,
and yet the door dost hold.
Demon with your sweetened smile,
hands held open, full of guile,
words unspoken still defile,
and yet the door dost hold.
Cloudbursts, sudden lightning strikes,
Rumble-thunder no one likes,
Flaming rains flood through the dikes
to crash against the door.
All the runes the spell demands
set within the pentagram
with finest skill and firmest hand -–
I cast the door aside.
Wisps of ash betrothed to fire,
Ghosts float past in gay attire,
Chaos reigns in firm desire
around the open door.
Laughter, cruel from sickly mind –-
How could I have been so blind?
A gentle shove comes from behind:
I meet the other side.
I fall as one within a dream
and turn to see his eyes agleam;
His laughter mingles with my scream:
He slowly shuts the door.
Moistened tongues that gently dab,
hands upon my shoulders grab,
cold talons, claws that deeply stab—
I look in hungry eyes.…
*”The Summons” may have been published by Luna Ventures in 1996 or 1997; however, after sending a query about its status without receiving any response, I withdrew the submission.
And the Dead Shall Inherit the Earth
A potion sipped by moistened tongue;
A mind whose thoughts are freely spun;
A hand that’s firm but gently held;
And whispered words of tortured spell;
The magic flows like well-made web;
The content sings of pain and dread;
The corpses flung from death betrayed
have stirred, are rising from their graves;
The silence gasps as movement creeps,
and once again are they who sleep
whose hands decayed and eyes of dust
upward through dirt are thrust;
The earth is bleeding tangled dead
with drops of blood that quickly spread
across the cemetery lawn
like frozen thoughts unbidden drawn;
A voice of driest crinkled leaf
has summoned them, said, “Come to me.”
And come they do with heavy stride
to stand as one, side by side,
an army dead for years untold,
their rusted swords held high and bold;
all gathered round their master and—
He cast his incantation wrong!
The dead whose voices seldom sing
Enclose him in a corporal ring;
His cries of anger, fear, and dread
appease the hunger of these dead.
When bony grips and toothy grin
have finished with their master’s skin,
they crunch on bone from leg and arm
and crush the faulty magic charm
whose flaws betrayed the wizard’s dream,
choking off his final scream.
The moral here? A simple one:
Leave a sleeping corpse alone!
Spell-Bound
A thaumaturgic circle made of chalk
derived from powdered bones of murdered men;
The symbols and the runes will never talk,
but will speak volumes to the demon-kin;
So simple are the lines and markings wrought,
and yet they will contain the deadly beast:
An inch inside, a world so danger fraught;
An inch outside, a world in seeming peace.
The demon-kin moves slowly in its cage
and surveys its integrity for holes,
and, finding one, it screams in gleeful rage
and steps with certainty and firm control.
He reaches for the wizard’s tiny neck
and stretches it until it starts to crack.…
All Hallows Eve
October rains have brought a sudden chill
that seeps into the marrow of my bone;
I stand like pine upon a broken hill
and find that I no longer stand alone;
Behind me in the mist, there is a form
escaping from the shadows of a cave;
Unleashed with vigor from the building storm,
it creeps in silence to a waiting grave;
I watch it folding back the sodden earth
to disappear inside a darkened stair
and feel my spirit gently giving birth
to horror that is well beyond compare—
until a claw comes reaching out for me,
and I am petrified and cannot flee.…
Blueblood’s Ghost
Blueblood’s ghost was an ornery sort,
haunting the alleys of Salem’s port,
chasing the men with a merry laugh,
and clacking the cobbles with his phantom staff.
For the women, he used a different ploy,
serenading them with a lover’s joy,
his voice was full and strong with sweet
for any poor lady he happened to meet.
The boats, it is said, could hear him bewail
for miles about in midwinter’s gale;
Shudders would spin down the sailors’ spines:
“Blueblood’s Ghost,” muttered time after time.
But the truth of the matter—if truth be told—
there were no ghosts left to behold,
For a figment was he from the distant past,
a fragment of legend with mythical cast.
But tell this not to the fearful men
who swear they hear him, time and again,
Nor to the ladies, blush though they do,
who whisper in secret of their lover’s coo,
For they will run you out of town
or find a stake and burn you down—
So nod your head and agree with them,
the odd little villagers from sleepy Salem.
A Moral Dilemma
If I can kill and slake my thirst for blood
and leave the siphoned bodies where they fall,
would that turn me into an undead stud
instead of just a creepy guy from hell?
Vampiric lusts have always come and gone
(it is the nature of my quaint disease),
but I have managed to forestall it some
by drinking blood from captive chimpanzees.
The nutrients I get aren’t quite enough
(there’s something missing that I need to have),
but I can compensate with human blood
while working on the mortuary staff.
This does negate my blood’s anemia:
I haven’t had to kill to get my blood.
Sage Advice on Monsters
[1]
A monster has a wicked attitude
because its hunger never seems to end;
Engrossed completely in its search for food,
he has no time at all for making friends;
I tell you this so you might comprehend
the plight of wicked monsters on the prowl,
and maybe if you try to understand,
you won’t be found inside their cooking bowl.
So, if you see a wicked monster’s eyes
looking hungrily into your own,
just say, “Hello,” and you might be surprised:
you could enjoy a dinner in his home.
But then, again, I could be quite in err;
It could just be a hungry monster there.
[2]
Now, dragons are another thing, indeed.
I met one, once, when I was very young.
You don’t go near their shiny claws or teeth
unless you want to be a dinner bun.
Their arrogance is legendary stuff;
Their ego is the only thing there is
that can surpass their appetite for blood.
It is a blessing that so few exist.
They do not yearn for friendly company
(their only wish is for a tasty meal),
and so, the wisest course for us must be
to flee from dragons flying in to kill.
Unless, of course, your courage is extreme,
surpassing every bit of reasoning.
[3]
I knew a man of courage named B’Rul,
who wished to slay a dragon for his love;
If you ask me, I think he was a fool:
There is no living woman worth that much.
He spoke to many sages in the land
in hopes that they might tell him where to go,
until he came across a willing man
who knew of where a dragon made its home.
The gold was given freely in advance;
B’Rul was bound to go and not return,
which made it quite unwise to take a chance
of not receiving payment that was earned.
It was a sound decision that I made:
I never saw B’Rul alive again.
B’Rul
I smell the scorching scent of dragon’s breath
and hear the grinding of its gnashing teeth;
The salty spray of blood means certain death
for all within its grasp—including me!
The thunder of its roar is like a God’s;
The shaking of the ground is frightening;
A warrior has a chance, so sing the bards,
and so the legends claim, eternally.
But here I stand, a foolish idiot
with tiny sword of rusted, dulling steel,
a revelation churning in my gut:
I know I do not stand a chance in hell!
I close my eyes and swing with all my might
and pray that I might make it through the night.…
Flying High
The dragon flew on winds adrift
to smell the carnage down below
that smoke and chaos chose to lift
above the trampled, bloody snow;
She felt her hunger grow and grow
and closed her eyes in utter bliss
and followed where the currents go
into the Mountains of the Mist.
Her senses craved to gently sift
the textures of her fallen foe
who seemed, to her, a trifle miffed
beneath the burnished, searing glow
that she had chosen to bestow;
In truth, she found she could resist
the craving that she brought in tow
into the Mountains of the Mist.
And so she flew above the rift
and passed the village Broken Bow
that read the portent as a gift
(a dragon’s rare, as we all know)
when she went by and didn’t throw
a single, warm, emblazoned kiss
and then they watched the warm wind blow
into the Mountains of the Mist.
Still held enraptured by the show,
forgetting where the mountain was,
the dragon crashed with force untold
into the Mountains of the Mist.
The Serpent’s Tongue
They came with vengeance late one dreamy night
and brought afflictions to the village folk;
The giant serpents with their poisoned bite
were singing riddles and sadistic jokes.
Their poisoned fangs were frightful things to see
attached to human heads with snake-like tails;
More frightful still, their songs of mockery
and haunted laughter like a banshee wail.
They slithered through the streets and struck with ease;
They brought with them a slow and painful death;
And not unlike a fetid, wet disease,
they infiltrated deeper with each breath.
They never once attacked us with their teeth:
They killed us with their twisted gaiety!
To the Gods, I Sing
Winter blows her blustery wind,
and the cold hard snow comes blown’ in,
but I’m warm, cozy and warm,
huddled by a fire, amid the storm.
My mind fills with thoughts of flame;
My soul is strong and free of shame;
My heart is cloaked in a web of fire;
My fingers caress the mystical lyre—
A tune I play, to warm the blood!
The song erupts in torrid flood!
The words and sounds of a long-lost tune,
soft ballads and lyrics so long unsung.
An epic of burning desires that be
in glorious Celtic history,
with bards and druids and wizards afoot,
gold and silver and other such loot—
A treasure trove of words I sing;
For the ears of one and all, I sing!
O’ glorious past that beckons me
from the frozen wastes of my misery;
Come, O Lords!  Come!  Come!
Take a weary soul to home!
And leave an earthen shell behind:
A feast for the hungry wolves of time.
To the Gods, I sing!
Magic Wood
When I went strolling by a hidden glen,
I paused to watch a lively little show
that’s seldom witnessed by us modern men:
An elf was dancing lightly on the snow.
The dance was one of intricate design
with weaving patterns shifting to and fro;
I felt a rhythmic answer in my mind
to fill a question that I hadn’t known.
The urge to dance came overwhelmingly;
My heart was beating with its lively song;
I could not stop the twitching of my feet
because the elfin magic was too strong—
And then the elf was gone, and there I stood,
perplexed and all alone amid the wood.
