Throw me to the Wolves
I slowly open my eyes a crack, then slam them shut again afraid of going blind as the sun’s rays beat down through a crack in the curtains straight into my eyes, groaning, I roll over hoping to go back to sleep but after a tussle with the pillows and blanket I find myself more awake than ever. Admitting defeat I sit up wiping my eyes clear squinting slightly as my eyes adjust to the light. Like a snail peeping out of its shell I emerge from my bed and wrap myself in my dressing gown, half asleep, I wander down the stairs yawning and stretching my arms above my head. As I walk into the kitchen I find all the rest of the family sat around the table with smiles on their faces
 “Finally, you’re awake I was about to come up and jump on you” my little brother David laughs his light blue eyes gleaming with glee
“It’s alive its alive, I tell you” my Dad laughs joining in and with the pair of them sat next to each other you would swear that they are the same person just aged a couple of decades. Both with the same blue eyes the same black hair and the same love of cracking awful jokes.
“ Nice of you to join us, I’ve been having to make sure that these lot don’t do eating everything before you get up” Mum smiles as I sit down to the table to find that despite her best efforts all I’m left with Is a few bits of bacon and some toast.
“I had the last egg” Laurens laughs spotting the disappointment on my face her light blonde hair a mess obviously not brushed and traces of toast around her mouth.
I say nothing as I sit there munching on my makeshift bacon sandwich as the others talk around me. They look like two sets of twins and one odd one out. Lauren has Mum’s dark brown eyes and blonde hair. I look nothing like any of my parents or grandparents, my hair a dirty blonde growing into curls as it gets longer and my eyes a darker ocean blue, a small nose and a set of  rather prominent ears complete my abnormalities but I like the way I look especially my eyes. I sometimes lose myself in the deep blue.
“Have you finished that book you were reading yet Jason I want to read it?” David asks across the table his mouth full of half chewed food.
I’m a huge fantasy nut. Dragons, ghosts, werewolves, vampires the lot I love it, I much prefer books to films I mean a films fine, but with a book you create the world in your own imagination. It's how you picture it to be. The latest book to be added to the collection is one about a boy who finds a dragon in the modern world and I loved it.
“ I finished it last night so after breakfast you can get it if you want, just don’t ruin it, ” I reply still cautious about lending him books since he left one outside in the rain and it was destroyed
“I’ll look after it don’t worry,” he replies darting off from the table excitedly marching up the stairs like a herd of elephants.
Excusing myself, I head upstairs to get dressed and as I have done for the last month I walk over to the calendar that hangs on my wall. Each month with a picture of a different mythological creature. From fairies to centaurs, but this month has one of my favourites. A werewolf. The picture is of a huge, powerful creature standing on two legs like a man but that’s all that remains. Every inch of its body ripple with muscles and is covered in straw like black hair. Its eyes a crimson red so bright it stands out in the dark, its mouth more like the muzzle of a dog full of ivory white fangs ready to rip a chunk of flesh out of its next victim. Underneath the picture is something even cooler though every day this month so far has been crossed off until only three remain two unremarkable days and one day of importance. My eighteenth birthday. I feel like a little child in the lead up to it. There’s so much going. Normally I’m not one of the big party’s but my parents are making a huge deal out of it and seem to enjoy doing it so who am I to spoil their fun? There’s not to be any booze though, is one rule my parents are huge on. They are the ultimate health fanatics and I guess it’s kind of rubbed off on me too. Not so much the eating, but the exercise has. I love to run. The wind blowing in your face, the feel of your heart smashing against your ribs and that primitive feeling of satisfaction you get when you prove that you are faster than others.                             
Rooting through my draws I pull out a bright blue shirt and navy Tracksuit and head downstairs making a bee-line for the door. “See you later guys I’m going to go and see if Dan’s up yet” I shout and I’m out the door before they can reply. Dan’s my best mate, although He’s kind of like my opposite in every way like while I’m a huge fantasy nut, he’s logical, but maybe that’s why we get along so well like yin and yang and all that stuff  We go to school together and have been friends since the start and he moved to Rathcoole last summer. It was great news Rathcoole is a very boring town with not many people our age around so for him to be moving here was great. I’d finally have someone to talk to. As I walk across the vast sea of green grass in the centre of the estate we live in find myself gazing around my home waving to the neighbours. Everyone gets along here and is friendly enough, but keep to themselves. I come to Dan’s front door and rap my knuckles off the painted oak. And moments later, he’s standing there dressed in full attire the same cheeky smile on his face as he always has his mop of light brown hair on his head covers his forehead almost down to his light blue eyes. Over his shoulders is his trademark backpack, which I knew he would have.
There’s a forest only a ten minute walk from the estate. Trees going on for as long as the eye can see. Dan and I love to go in there exploring childish for a pair of teens so what. There’s loads of cool stuff to find in the forest. Fox holes, Bones Nests. To us its heaven. We run through the forest feeling like we were the most badass people in the world. If anyone saw us they’d probably think we were a pair of walks. My parents hate me going up here they said it was too dangerous, but I won’t let them stop me from having a bit of fun. They probably know that I still go up here, but either realize that I’m not going to stop or they realize that I’m not going to hurt myself “One of you will fall and hurt yourself one of these days” they’d constantly say like a broken record last summer Dan and I even built ourselves a little shelter while we were up there. We own those parts. We soon come to the opening into the forest that we always use and brush the chaotic overgrowth out of the way as we make our way into our safe haven, but as soon as I got my way through the last of the overgrowth I can see straight away that something else has been here. Deep gouges cut into the bark of the trees like a bear was trying to cut them down. As if in a trance I walk over to where one of the trees has been slashed and place my hand against the ruined wood. The cuts go inches deep the floor covered with the decimated wood                                                                             “What do you think done this Dan?” I ask turning around hoping he might with his logical mind tell me what it was because all that comes to my mind is the picture of my calendar.
“I….. I….. I don’t know,” he stammers his skin turning a ghostly white as his stand paralyzed to the spot. Walking around mind racing trying to think what it was that done this I come across something possibly even cooler than the tattered trees. Tracks
“Look at these tracks Dan” I exclaimed excitedly “they look like dog tracks, but I’ve never seen a dog this big”                                   Dan walks over and observes the tracks and gasps. Imprinted on the earth is what looks like a dog footprint, the shape similar but the size it cannot belong to a dog unless it’s the size of a lion.   “Come on, let’s follow them and see where they lead” I suggest excitedly but I find nothing but fear in his face, “No, let’s head back” Dan says firmly                                                                     “You can if you want but I’m following them” and I dart off following the tracks.                                                                               I can hear Dan following reluctantly behind. The tracks seem to go on forever. I lose them a couple of times, but manage to find them again. Dan seems to be really edgy, which isn’t like him, but I don’t say anything. He’d tell me if something was up wouldn’t he? After following the tracks for what seems like an age they just suddenly disappear. Dan seems to let out a big sigh (out of relief?) and seems to perk up. But then I find something that stops my heart and I cannot hold back the gasp of horror. The trees here are painted red. Huge splattering’s of red that I know straight away is blood dripping onto the floor and staining the leaves and ground. I stand there for only a second trying to comprehend the scene till in the distance I hear a twig snap with such ferocity that I turn and run as hard as my legs will carry me not caring about the stinging nettles that brush my feet or the thorny brambles that cut my hands. Dan had already gone and I don’t see him as I run back as fast as I can. Not stopping until I’ve got home and collapsed upstairs onto my bed, unable to get what I had just seen out of my head.                                                                                                         “Did you see anything cool up at the forest today “David asks me just walking into my room without knocking, so irritating.  I know he won’t leave me alone until I tell him something so I lie and tell him we found an old fox den with a birds skeleton inside.                                                                                                “Can I come up with you next time, please it sounds so cool, ” he pleads with me                                                                                 “Sorry, but Mum and Dad would kill me if I took you up there and you got hurt” I say promptly
He storms out of my room in a strop like a small child. Little brothers go figure. And I hear him storm downstairs and into the sitting room
“JASON!” Mum shouts up the stairs and grumbling to myself, I head downstairs to face the inevitable.
That little rat he ran and told Mum and Dad everything I had ever told him about up in the forest. I want nothing more than to yell at him, but he’s hiding upstairs as Mum and Dad give me a good old telling off.
 “We’ve told you so many times not to go up there it’s dangerous”
“What would you do if you got hurt or Dan did well? WELL?” 
“I’d laugh at him for being stupid enough to get hurt” I know the moment it leaves my mouth that it was a big mistake to say that. 
“That's how you treat your friends is it”. “Do you think you’re clever or something” They go on like this for ages. They don’t even let me out the room for toilet breaks, but shockingly, they don’t punish me any other way, just asked me to promise I wouldn’t go up there again. What they don’t know is that I won’t be going up there again promise or no promise. Being dismissed I head back to my room and turn on my laptop hoping that I might be able to find out what those tracks belonged to but I find nothing spinning around I find myself staring at the calendar staring at me and my eyes drift down to its feet and my heart leaps as I realise that one I’m being a fool they don’t exist and two the footprint is all wrong so my mind settles. Boy, I do read too much fantasy. 
Something wrong with Dan of that much I’m certain.  He seems to be a bit distracted of late always seems to be looking over his shoulder as if he’s expecting someone. I can tell something’s bothering him, but every time I ask him what’s wrong, he just looks at me and smiles. But it’s not his normal cheeky grin, it’s more like a strained smile when you’re having to be polite to someone you don’t like. He won’t talk to me about what we found up in the forest ever he always changes the subject back to football or something else, even if we had just talked about it or just says nothing till I start a different topic. This is not the normal Dan that I’ve known for almost six years he seems almost like a ghost of himself and I’ll be dammed if I’m just going to sit here and stress over it. No friends stick together and if he won’t tell me what frightened him so much I’ll find it myself. Even if it means going back to the bloody forest My parents think that I’ll stop going up the forest know, but I’m only more determined to go up there know something up there has scared the life out of my friend and I’m going to find out what it is consequences be dammed. I grab a few of my exploring tools a penknife a flask of water and some food. Shout up to my parents that I’m going out and slip out before they can ask what I’m going I don’t like to lie to them, but is keeping your mouth shut really lying I walk up to the forest’s entrance and head in and find  sight that I cannot believe. The gouges in the trees have gone as if they had never existed. But I don’t let it faze me, I’m here to try and find what has shaken my friend so much and browse the floor trying to find the footprints once more, but like the trees all evidence of them has disappeared, leaving me to head back the way I came defeated and head home, I still had a bit of water left so I put in on my top and my hair to make it look like I’ve been running and head home but as I turn into the estate it straight away becomes apparent that something is wrong. There’s police cars at both my home and Dan’s. My first thought is of my family please don’t say anyone’s been hurt. I hope nothing serious has happened. I don’t utterly panic this isn’t my first time dealing with police. A few months back, I was involved with police for supposed assault, but the bastard had it coming no one lays a finger on my family especially my Mum. He thought I was out, but he got quite a shock when I ran out and knocked the stuffing out of him. I was given a warning, but I could tell by their faces that they went going to do anything else. The best thing to do is be honest. Yes, I did hurt him, but I had a valid reason. They left and there was no more contact from them. The lad that started it well let’s just say he won’t even walk past our house anymore. Don’t get me wrong, I’m no hero I’m not even a great fighter, but there’s a line that you don’t cross. As I’m walking home a policeman gets out his car and calls me over and I can’t suppress that little tingle of fear down my spine 
“Hey, you’re not Dan Lambert by any chance are you” a look of hope on his face 
“Sorry, no I’m Jason a friend of his why is he in trouble or something” hoping that the answers yes, because otherwise that means something’s happened to Dan” 
“I don’t think it’s my place to say, but I’d get home quickly if I was you “his tone sound quite sympathetic I tell him I will and bid him farewell.  Our estate is pretty small and well laid out so it doesn’t take me long to get home. I can see a lot of the neighbours looking out the windows, but I know it’s out of concern rather that looking for gossip. Rathcoole may be a small town, but there is a strong community spirit.
I get to the door and can see my Mum and Dad sitting in the family room with a policewoman. They seem to be very upset Mum looks like she’s been crying. 
I brace myself and head in. As soon as I open the door my Mum runs to the door and hugs me, normally I’d try to push her off I’m not I hugging person, especially around others, but this time I don’t and I hug her back, she doesn’t say anything. She doesn’t need to. When she finally breaks the embrace, she leads me into the family room and introduces the policewoman as officer chandler 
“Please call me Lydia “she seems nice enough long blonde hair, green eyes she looks pretty young. 
“Where have you been” my Mum asks with unexpected venom. This is no time for lies so I tell her I was up in the forest. She doesn’t say anything but gives me a look saying, well talk about this later and I turn my attention the police woman sat on the sofa “if you don’t mind officer, I’m mean Lydia, but why are you here?” she looks a bit taken aback by the bluntness of the question I think she had hoped to take it slow and tell me whatever it was gently. 
“It’s about your friend Dan I’m afraid Jason,” she replies not fully answering my question. 
“What, is he in trouble or something? I wouldn’t know anything I haven’t spoken to him in a while” 
“No, he’s not in trouble at all, it’s just that he’s disappeared and his Mum called us to try and find him and we thought you might know where he went” Lydia says bluntly I guess she realized I don’t need to be treated like a child. I’m shocked by this news, but something doesn’t seem right, I know Dan he’s not the type to run from something.
“He’s been missing for around a week sounds like that’s why he wasn’t contacted you”. Lydia seems like a smart cookie being able to put the pieces together like that. 
“What were you doing the last time you spoke to Dan?” 
“We were up at the nearby forest, but he started to feel ill, so we started to head back and I haven’t spoken to him since “ I tell her even though I want so much to tell her what I saw in the forest, but it’s gone. She would go up there and think that I’m a loon. Then I would never find out the truth Lydia leaves when she realizes I don’t know anymore and tells my parents, they may be back in touch and promises to do her best to find Dan. 
“You promised that you wouldn’t go up to that forest again” Mum shouts as the police car whizzes away her voice full of hurt so I just stay quiet and nod slightly tuning off as the rant begins the usual “what if you fall” and “what if you got stuck” till she says something that I have never heard in the rant something that sets off every alarm bell in the back of my head “you have no idea what is in that forest”. Her face turns wool white and she looks at me as if a secret had been ruined.
“Go to your room now,” she says with a wave of her hand and I walk up to my room and sit slowly on the bed. “You have no idea what’s in that forest” the line  keeps playing over and over in my head, maybe it just because it seemed out of place, maybe it’s because of the way she stopped after saying it and walked off after saying. Maybe it’s the way her face looked like she knew she shouldn’t have said and walks off mid rant “you have no idea what’s in that forest” what did she mean? Maybe they know what it was but why would they never go into the forest or do they? Something stinks here and I’m going to find out what. It’s not like my parents to hide something from me they value truth over anything else “a lie cheats everyone” my Dad often says. We are always honest with each other (well, almost cut me some slack will you) and my parents always encourage us to share our problems “a problem halved is a problem halved “is another commonly used phrase in our home, I think it’s stupid all you would have to do is tell your problem to loads of people and the problem isn’t a problem anymore. Is it possible that the same thing that’s frightened Dan so much is the same thing that’s frightening my parents so much? God, I hate being left out of secrets. Now what do I do, there’s obviously something in that forest that has freighted both my closet friend and my parents who are the toughest people I know. But what?  I need to get up to the forest again and find those tracks. Those tracks are the key if I can find those tracks again and follow them to the source I might be able to find out what’s going on... So I sit there trying to come up with a way to sneak out of the house tonight without my parents finding out I’m at it for hours coming up with elaborate schemes then poking holes in them again till I hear the front door open. Curious, I open my bedroom door and look over the bannister to find Dan’s Mum stood in the hallway. I head downstairs feeling I should really go down and consul her. Walking into the sitting room, I find her sitting still in her pyjamas with a jacket over the top with my Mum and Dad fussing over her, she’s obviously been crying a lot her normally well-kept hair is a mess Mum and Dad both leave the room saying they are going to go and make some tea. We sit there in silence for a while, not sure what to say to one another. I want to tell her my fears, but I can’t even put it into words. With a shaky hand, she reaches into the front pocket of her jacket and pulls out an envelope and holds it out
“I found this in Dan’s room,” she says simply as I take the envelope from her hand gently afraid of breaking the fragile woman                                                                                               Jason,                                                                                                        You have been possibly the greatest friend I could have wished for and I love you as a brother but now I have to leave. I cannot tell you why or if I will return, but it is breaking my heart to do so and I wish that I could be around to see you be the success I know you will be. Dan
The silence that follows is almost worse than the shouting. The tears that I had been holding back begin to flow. Dan you’re a fool. Running away, never solves anything. You taught me that when you got me to come home after I ran off after an argument with my parents. You should have come to me if there was a problem you know I would have been there for you like you have been for me. We could have taken this on together. But maybe he didn’t run of maybe he’s lying there hurt with no one to hear him. But then why did he leave the note and why all the mystery. What were you thinking Dan? There’s so many questions without answers. Why didn’t you let me help or at least try to help? Dan’s Mum says nothing as she rises and leaves and I don’t bid her farewell. I just sit and stare at the TV blankly nothing seems important know I put out a tough face for while the police were here but know its crumbling. I think about all the fun times we’ve had. Going down the town, playing football on the pitch, causing the teachers at school all sorts of grief Simple things that I won’t be able to do with him anymore. Missing isn’t dead I keep telling myself, but it’s only a small comfort. I feel a tear roll down my cheek and run up to my room before anyone sees. All I can think about is Dan. My parents have tried to help. They say that they understand, but how can they understand they’ve never had a friend disappear. The constant worry that there in trouble is enough to make anyone mad. But I know Dan, he’s the smartest person I know. He’s probably fine, just lost somewhere. Come home Dan please your Mum needs you, I need you. Come home to us David came in to ask me to play with him, but I said no and when he starts to pester I lost it and shouted at him he ran out crying. I felt bad, but I didn’t go after him like I would normally. Nothing seems to matter anymore. My parents try their hardest, Take me out shopping, and get me to go out with them to the park. I go to make sure that my brothers and sisters think I’m O.K., but my parents see straight through me they can see that behind the smiles and the wisecracks that my mind is somewhere else. I feel no emotion, not happiness nor sadness, not excitement nor disappointment. The world just rolls on around me while I’m locked inside my shell of grief. We are gathered in the sitting room watching a new film I had wanted to see so my parents brought it in the slightest hope that it will help but all that is on my mind is my missing friend as I sit there all I can think of is the forest. My mind tells me that it’s ridiculous, but my heart says he’s there. I can’t shake the feeling that’s where I’ll find him like an itch I just can’t scratch. So I rise without a sound and put on my shoes, my Mum looks at me as I open the door, but doesn’t say a word just a look of concern and leaves me to wander the streets and gather my thoughts
The sun is still beating down, a huge yellow orb in the clear blue sky, the streets are abandoned as I wander with only the want to find my friend to guide me. I’m not forced on direction relying only on memory of the route. A couple start to catch up behind me, I’m not surprised the route I take is very popular so I pay them no attention. But then something else catches my attention I’m at the opening to the forest. So much of me wants to go in there and search for answers, but I also want to put it all behind me, everything seems to revolve around this forest somehow and if I’m ever going to find out I’ll have to go back. While I’m standing there I realise that the couple of walkers that were behind me are walking towards me. Maybe me and Dan weren’t the only ones who went in there “or maybe they're looking for you” part of my brain says and losing my cool, I turn to walk on but I turn into one of the walkers. He’s tall with blonde hair cut into a Mohawk. Blue eyes, they look almost exactly the same colour as Dan’s. He’s dressed in a pair of worn Tracksuit pants and a Manchester jersey he looks like he’s around his mid twenty’s I turn around to walk the other way but I’m blocked by the other walker. She’s short with almost unnaturally black hair cut very short at the sides with the middle still quite long which looks almost like its standing on end. 
“Look, I don’t know who you guys are but you better leave me alone or I’ll….” I start trying to sound less frightened than I am
“You need to come with us” the man remarks his voice deep and dry
My heart starts to beat so fast that insure it’s going to burst out my chest. I’m terrified. I have no idea who these people are or what they want with me, but I'm sure that they don’t have good intentions. My eyes dart from side to side trying to see if there is any possible way for me to get away but I find none. 
“I wouldn’t bother trying to run or shouting for help, we would easily catch you and there is no one around to hear you” the man says. 
My mind is racing trying to find a way to escape. There is no way that I would be able to run past them into the road, but I can run the other way. Into the forest. The idea seems mad but yet it may just work. I smirk to myself.
“What’s so funny” the woman asks confused “I hope you like nature” I say and turn and flee into the mass of trees in front of me.
I run as hard as I can. Pushing the muscles in my legs to the brim. I don’t bother trying to move around the lower branches and both my arms and face are sore from being hit. I can’t tell if they are following me. I haven’t looked back to see every ounce of energy I have is being used to run. I start to slow and look around trying to see if they have followed me, but I can’t see anything then CRACK. A twig snaps just to the side of me and I whizz around to see what it was and I can’t see anything, then I hear the rustle of leaves behind me and turn to see what is there only to find that there is nothing there again. I turn to start to walk back and find in front of me stands a sight that takes my breath away.
Stood a short distance away from me is a creature I only know from books and films. A werewolf. Stood at almost twice my height arms and legs rippling with muscles. What must have been its hands and fingers is now a set of razor sharp claws just waiting to rip into my flesh. Its face is twisted into a vicious snarl. Drool leaking out of its mouth onto the floor. Its teeth showing long and razor sharp. They look like they could even cut through bone like butter. Its eyes look full of hate and anger. The white is not white at all but rather black. Its iris is the most vivid shade of red it’s almost like blood. Its fur is perfectly black all over and looks almost like it takes the light from around it and makes the place dark. I’m frozen to the spot as this behemoth of a creature starts to pad its way towards me, its eyes fixed on me. I turn to try and run in a panic and in faced by the same sight except this one is not as bulky and not as high up. They start to circle me, toying with me almost. I stand there with fists raised, trying to look like I have a chance of fighting back, but I know I don’t stand a chance the smaller of the two wolves’ jumps at me and I duck and it flies over me. The other one jumps at me and this time I can’t get out the way and it hits me like a car knocking me to the ground. It pins down my arms with its front legs and it looks me straight in the face. Drool leaks from its mouth soaking my top. Its breath stinks like a dogs. I scramble across the floor trying to get away, but in pins my arm down with one paw. I try to pull it loose, but it won’t budge. Using its free paw it seems to take its time slowly cutting up my arm with its claws almost smiling as I scream in pain as it rips through my flesh. As I lay there on the verge of losing consciousness I hear faint footsteps coming towards me growing louder and louder and moving at incredible speed. The two werewolves leave my side to investigate. I open my eyes to look and see what was going on and see the two black wolves stood in front of me parted just enough that I can see what was making the footsteps stood in front of the two wolves is a man I have never seen before. He looks old enough to be a grandfather. His hair is a light grey colour and is tied in a ponytail. A shabby beard just as grey covers the bottom of his face. His eyes are vibrant purple colour.                                                                                               That is strange enough, but he is not alone stood at his side is a wolf, larger than a normal wolf built more like an ox but other than that it looks ordinary its fur a mix of shades of grey
 “Leave know and we will let you live” the man says and both the black wolf turn and start to back away till they're both at my side and one raises a paw and holds it over my neck but the man’s face stays stern.
“Harm him and I will make sure that you die slowly and painfully” the man replies and the werewolves paw slowly falls from my neck.
“Now leave and there will be no fighting today,” he says almost like an order and the werewolves don’t move growling softly their eyes fixed on the intruders
“Fine then, have it your way” the old reply’s and in an instant he is  gone, replaced by a wolf much like the other except this one has fur of a perfect snow white. The sight of the two wolves is enough to send the werewolves fleeing with their tails between their legs.
I stand there with my mind numb with fear, pain and confusion. I can feel the blood running down my arm drenching my skin, but I don’t make a move to stop it as I stare at the two wolves stood in front of me. The gapping mound on my arm burns with searing pain and I fall to the floor in agony. The damp ground softens the fall as I lay there sobbing in pain. My entire body is burning. The world flits in and out of focus and I must be hallucinating from the pain because the wolf seems to change shape into a boy who looks remarkably like Dan.
“Oh, Jason, what have they done to you,” he says, his voice solemn                                                                                                                  “hold on Jason it’s going to be okay,” he says as he holds me in his arms. The old man soon joins his side and looks down at me an almost disappointed look on his face.                                                                                                                                                     “Leave him Dan, he’s one of them now he’s lost,” he says, placing a comforting hand on his shoulder
 “NO…. I won’t let it.” Dan sobs                                                             “that is your decision Dan I won’t sway you, you know the risks as well as I do.” the old man says coldly.                                      He sits there looking at me such sadness in his gaze. Tears roll down his cheek and under his breath he whispers.                                         “I’m sorry but the risk is too much Jason. I cannot save you from this” he says before rising to his feet and reluctantly walks away from me laying on the ground.                                                       The old man whispers something to him that I cannot hear and without looking back the pair disappear as quickly as they appeared.                                                                                                             I lay there unable to will my body to move as the sound of their footsteps gets further and further away till all I can hear it the sounds of the trees and the birds.                                                     The abandonment sends a wave of anger through my soul. I got into this mess trying to find him and when I do he just leaves me laying here to die! Well I’m not going to let it happen. I roll onto my back and lay there for a moment breathing deeply to get my breath back and send oxygen to my limbs. Using all the strength in my body I sit up crying out with the movement of my arm. My entire forearm is red from the cut but the bleeding seems to have stopped. I slowly push myself to my feet moving as little as possible. My legs feel like jelly underneath me and I wait a moment before taking a step but that moment isn’t enough and I sway wildly and have to support myself on a nearby tree to avoid falling and starting again. A quick deep breath and a begin trudging through the woods each step takes an eternity and I seem to make almost no headway. I have no idea what direction to head in completely acting on gut instinct and hope.                                                                                          I feel dizzy and sit on a fallen tree to wait for it to pass but what feels like minutes pass and it doesn’t fade. The world is spinning and I have no idea what to do. The forest shows no sign of thinning out, I have way to contact anyone and I’ve lost a lot of blood. No sooner have I assessed the situation to be near hopeless does a body begin to emerge from the growth in front of me. Flitting between the trees trying not to be seen moving faster than my eyes can see.                                                                “Who’s out there? Please I need our help” I shout desperation creeping into my voice.                                                                               For a moment nothing happens and I sit there wondering if maybe I had imagined it when the person emerges from the back of the trees and my heart stops. My situation was almost hopeless before but now my fate is sealed I thought I had found help but instead I found hell. Stood there gazing at me a flicker of shock on her face is one of the two werewolves that attacked me.
“No way” she gasps walking towards me. I don’t bother trying to run. There is no point. I can’t out run that. I sit there fighting not to show any fear.                                                                                 The girl crouches in front of me and grabs my arm harshly tuning it to get a good look at the wound.                                                    “This would have killed most people yet you not only survived it but walked away from it” she mutters as if I’m not here and I just look at her blankly.                                                                                     As she looks at the wound my breathe catches in my throat and I cough painfully. My heart beats faster and faster beating faster than should be possible. The force making my ribs ache. My world spin faster and faster till everything is smudged together and I fall of the fallen tree to the ground and the girl looks at me with what almost looks like concern.                                                     “Oh my……” she starts stopping midway as I lay there unable to do a thing.                                                                                                     She crouches next to me and pushing her lips right up to my ear she whispers                                                                                                      “I’m sorry but I can’t let you change. Not here. Not now” she whispers and before the sound has faded the world goes dark.                          
“He can’t be. He said it was the other one. The younger one”                      “he must be. No one else could have survived that sudden change. The sheer shock should have killed him let alone the change.”                                                                                                        The voices are right next to me but they sound like a whisper as the world comes back. My eyelids flutter as I wake up with no memory of how I got here but in a wave of memories I remember everything before. I manage to not panic and do anything reckless and stay laying there listening to the pair. One of the voices is unmistakably the girl from the woods but the other I have never heard before. His voice so forceful it leaves no room for argument.                                                                              “I’m telling you there is something different about him. Before I stopped him turning I saw his eyes” she says stopping at what must be the key point                                                                                       “and Clair? What did you see?” the man asks eagerly                                    “they were red” she says and an ominous silence grips the room                                                                 
                                                    
                                                                                                      
“Wait……” the man says and I feel the vibrations in the ground as he walks towards me.                                                                                       “Instead of lying there on the ground pretending to be asleep why don’t you get up” the man says and with a gulp I climb with surprising ease to my feet. The pain in my arm has gone but I don’t have time to look as I find myself face to face with the man. His face hard and stern with no trace of emotion. His ice blue eyes so cold they send a chill down my soul. His arms crossed obviously not impressed. Dressed all in black with shaggy black hair. I don’t turn away but instead hold his gaze. I strange instinct to hold my ground fills my brain and as we stand there in a glare off a smile threatens to creep into his face.                    “Not many people will stand face to face with me.” he says his voice still firm but soften slightly.                                                                 “That tells me almost everything I need to know about you but not your name” he says going from intimidating to friendly in a second.                                                                                                            “Jason” I say simply looking around me. I’m stood in a dingy, damp room. All four walls nothing but bare concrete. No windows, the only light coming from a small bulb above us. The floor is almost bare other than a couple of sleeping bags and a single duvet that I was laying on. Dried specks of blood cover it.                                                                                                             “I’m Luke and that is Sarah” he says waving at the girl who stands there intimidated by the man.                                                               “What do you want with me?” I ask afraid but seeing to be doing a good job of hiding it.                                                                              “We didn’t want you. This is a turn of events that was never in the plans. We came here looking for something not someone. It just turns out that thing is you.” he says speaking in riddles                        “you’re not making any sense” I protest irritated                                       “how familiar are you with werewolves and lycanthropy?” he asks raising a bushy eyebrow                                                                              “a bit. It’s a curse or disease that makes a human part wolf and they change with the moon.” I say getting a laugh in response                    “I bet you think we fight vampires too. Some see it as a curse yes but not all and yes it makes us part wolf but it’s not as black and white as that. Any people think they both talk about one thing. They don’t” Luke explains 
“Your friend Connor is what you call a werewolf. They are the more recent what you might call breed taking the form of the animal completely while you and I, we are lycans.” He says as if discussing the weather but I’m hit with a bombshell                               “you’re kidding right?” I scoff but his face remains serious                           “you was turned. Just scratching doesn’t do it you have to actually want to turn them.” Luke explains                                                “so who was it that turned me then? You? Sarah? WHO?” I shout and the power in my voice stuns me.                                                   “I did” Luke replies “well my wolf did. That’s one of the differences between lycans and werewolves. They are in control as their wolves. We don’t.” Luke elaborates and the way he says it so plainly is cruel.                                                                     “So do you know why your wolf done it?” I hiss                                             “I think it knew that you was the one. It knew that you are the wolf of shadow”                                                                                                    “what the hell is the wolf of shadow?”                                                                 “The wolf of shadow is a legend in our race. It is the strongest of us. It is the lycan that we have been waiting and praying for” 
“And you think that it’s me?” I reply my brain overwhelmed                        “no. we know that it is you” Sarah says prompting a glare of daggers from Luke.                                                                                     “So what happens now?” I ask knowing I’m not going to like the answer.                                                                                                     “Your body is still adapting and as such you may feel nausea and suffer migraines but the worst is over. You will need to leave with us and learn how to control the wolf or it can and probably will consume you” Luke says almost ordering me.                          “And if I refuse? Tell you I’m not going with you and go home?” I reply not leaving his gaze                                                                   “then head out the door and head west you will be home before dinner” he replies waving at the door.                                                       “That’s it? I’m free to go?” I reply puzzled                                                    “there is no rule forcing you to stay. We will be here for a few more days so if you change your mind”                                                       “I won’t” I but in and head towards the door                                                      “Just one more thing Jason.” Luke calls and I stop                                                 “Keep an eye out for hunters” he calls and I walk out the door.
I discover that this whole time we have been inside the foundation for a new house. The garden outside is overgrown and the construction looks abandoned. I have no idea what the time is or what I am going to tell my parents but I’ll have time to think on the way but only one thought fills my mind or rather one person. Connor. He abandoned me, left me for dead. I thought he was my friend. At first I’m sad, sad that my friendship was a lie then that sadness turns to anger. It boils my blood and what seems like a growl escapes my lips.                         
The sun is setting as I get to the outside of my estate but I hesitate. What will I tell them? I have no idea how long I have been gone. I’ll tell them I got lost up in the forest and hope that they don’t pry. Taking a deep breath I head home for some reason afraid, part of me feels like this is wrong like I’m going the wrong way but I ignore it and carry on. The estate is almost derelict as I head home and I find the car gone. The floor around where it was covered in clothes, food anything and everything. I try to open the door and find it’s locked. No one answers my knocks. I’m stood there for a solid five minutes before the hairs on the back of my neck stand on edge and I turn around to find stood at the edge of the drive my once friend now I don’t know what Connor.                                                   “They left Jason I’m sorry. When they found out what you are” he says calmly and I don’t move the news hurting more than any broken bone.                                                                                                 “I’m sorry Jason really I...”                                                                    “You left me” I mutter and Connor stops                                                        “I was laying there bleeding and you walked away without looking back” I say louder this time anger creeping into my voice                                                                                                                     “I couldn’t help you Jason. I’m sorry for what you have become” Connor says his voice full of genuine regret                                        “and what am I Connor? You keep telling me you it’s all because of what I am. I had no choice. I didn’t chose this no more than you chose your parents. What I am doesn’t change who I am” I protest passionately outraged. Slowly making my way from the front door to the end of the drive till we are feet apart. My hands open and close as I look at him the memory filling my head                                                                                                               “why did you come here Connor?” I ask his appearance makes no sense                                                                                                         “I came to apologise and to see what my friend has become”                     “and are you pleased with what you see Connor? Do I meet your high expectations? Are you expecting a monster or a quivering boy?” I rant pacing back and forth the emotion flowing freely mixing into a mess.                                                                         “I don’t know what I expected but I had to see” he replies.                                   “Now you have seen you can leave” I demand waving him away but he doesn’t budge.                                                                          “No Jason you have to leave. This area is our territory and you have to go” Connor orders and I twist my head to face him and growl                                                                                                                “this is my home. I am not going anywhere” I reply turning my back to him walking back to the front door.                                                 I can hear his footsteps behind me, brisk and full of purpose. I can almost feel the air move as his hand falls towards my shoulder.                                                                                                             Spinning around I grab his arm in the air and his face becomes snow white.                                                                                                      
“I told you I am not going anywhere” I snarl but he is not intimidated                                                                                                    “yes you are” he says smirking sending a left hook flying catching me hard on the jaw and stumbling to my feet.                                  “Please Jason just leave” he pleads and I don’t reply staying crouched on the floor. I rise slowly my breathing deep and slow my finders balled into fists. I move fast rising to my feet and swinging a long left with the turn of my body. I catch Connor hard on the temple but feel nothing as I watch him fall sideways landing with a thud on the tarmac. I don’t stop picking him up by the side of his clothes I fling him through the air and he skims down the road like a stone.                                            “You don’t have the right to tell me to leave” I cry walking after him as he tries to pick himself up                                                           “Jason” a voice I’ve only heard once shouts, turning my back to Connor I find the man who convinced him to leave                                 “ don’t go down this path. Connor had to leave you. If he had tried to save you it could have killed you” he says bluntly and I’m halted in my tracks                                                                                      
“The mix of the two bloods could have killed you” he repeats his voice and face a blank canvas.                                                                      “I’m sorry Jason I really am but there is a way to save you” Connor groans picking himself up from the floor.                                            
“Save me? What make me human again?” I ask half hopeful and he shakes his head.                                                                                                        “No you would be a werewolf like me” he says simply.                                “No. this is the path I’m on and I’ll follow it wherever it leads” I decide.                                                                                                              “Then I’m afraid you will have to leave. This is farewell between us Jason and I hope we don’t meet again” he says leaving the threat hanging in the air.                                                                                “I will come back Connor and when I do I hope I don’t find you here because I don’t think the shred of friendship we have is going to hold long and when that tether snaps I will be coming for you..” I growl.                                                                                         Turning my back I set off to my new home, my new family. I don’t look back I don’t cry or feel sad. That chapter of my life is over. A new one begins.

As I walk back down the road to the shell of home my mind is racing. The way I picked up Connor and threw him with such ease, no one has that sort of strength? Part of me feels guilty, he didn’t have much of a choice but then there’s a side of me that can’t look past his abandonment. He left me there then convinced my parents to leave. I stop at the side of the road and take a deep breath trying to control my thoughts. My family is done. I’m at war with my best friend and in a monster the like of which I have never seen. Tears roll down my face at the thought of my family. Mum and Dad, Lauren and David. I might never see them again.                                                                      A deep breath and a wipe of my eyes and I start my journey again though this time I look back even though I can’t see home. Maybe it’s better this way, maybe in not supposed to stay home. One thing I do know is I have nowhere else to go.
I find Luke and Sarah sat outside the grey shell talking but they stop as soon as they see me and both look at me Sarah with a look of hope and Luke with a gaze of surprise.                                                “I didn’t expect to see you again” Luke comments dryly                              “nor did I but before I go anywhere with you I want to know exactly what I am” I demand and a smirk crosses Luke’s lips                           “I told you before you are the shadow wolf. The strongest, fastest Lycan.” He says and jealousy stains his voice.                                     “You are thinking of leaving aren’t you?”  Sarah asks sounding sadden by the idea                                                                                                 “Most Lycans do but I would advise you don’t. Most lone wolves don’t last too long.” Luke adds and looks like he is about to say more when footsteps start from inside getting closer and closer till the maker emerges.                                             His face soft but strong his head and chin face covered by a slightly greying beard. His eyes seem to look straight into your soul and read everything. Dressed in a colourful short sleeve shirt and a pair of slightly faded jeans and black trainers.                                “But most lycans aren’t you” he says his voice gentle and reassuring and I feel all anger melt away.                                                        “I would be nice if I was you Luke. He may be a new pup but I’ll bet he’s stronger than you” the man says seriously and Luke just grumbles                                                                                                       “ please follow me we have a lot to discuss and out here I feel like I’m going to be heard” he says and I follow even though I had been planning to leave                                                                          the room we walk into is far lighter than the one I was in before and boasts a couple of stools and table along with a sleeping bag                                                                                                               “ please sit” he says waving at the free stool as he sits on the other.                                                                                                                 “I’m Ryan and the one that was put in charge of finding you” he says just as I sit down.                                                                             “Well not you specifically but what you are” he says obviously realising what my next question would be.                                                    “And would you care to be a bit more in depth about what I am?” I ask irritated that everyone is only half answering the questions.                                                                                                            “You are the descendant of the first lycan. Your blood is already a fraction wolf so the change is easier for you. You are the only lycan able to control your wolven half and are stronger and faster than the rest of us” he says simply and stops giving me a chance to process the information.                                                                  “We didn’t know it was you. We only knew it was one of your family” he adds and pulling a thickly folded piece of paper from his pocket he lays it on the table and I straight away realise what it is                                                                                                “A family tree” I gasp. Running my finger along it I’m lost                            “none of the names on here are my family”                                                       “no none of the names of your kidnappers are here. The people that had been raising you were hunters. They took you and killed your parents.” He says softly and I shake my head                                   “no. your wrong” I protest but it explains why left so quickly.                      “I’m sorry Jason” Ryan says placing a hand on my shoulder and I see genuine sympathy in his gaze                                                               “why do you care? I’m not related to you or even friends with you” I snap my world going mad.                                                              “No but you are a Lycan and all lycans are family” he says and I see the same hope I will stay in his gaze.                                                 “If I stay what happens then?” I ask                                                                  “you will come with us to meet the rest of the pack. You will learn how to fight, how to control the beast inside and then if you want to you can help us.                                                                                                           “Help you what?”                                                                                       “Help us hunt down the Hunters and help us finally live in peace.” He says and the idea of a home is a lift to my heart.                          “You don’t have to be alone Jason. Come with us. We are not monsters. You are free to leave anytime.” He says and walks out leaving me to decide and it’s an easy decision. I have no alternative. I have nowhere else to go, I have no one else. I am a Lycan so I may as well live like one.                                                      









Born into the pack 
The three of us have been travelling for what feels like days and I still have no idea where we are going. The roads we take are all new to me either half hidden dirt tracks though overgrowth or back roads that are cracked and full of holes. The other three make small talk mentioning names and places I have never heard. I just walk along at the side listening and looking at the world around me.                                                                       “What do you think Jason?” Ryan asks out of the blue and I have no idea wat he’s talking about.                                                                       “I’m sorry what?” I ask and he just smiles at my confusion                              “there’s a town nearby. Do you think we should go through or should we go around through the fields?” He asks                                       “it would be easier to pass through without questions in the town. If we got seen in the fields it might be harder.” I think aloud and I see the head of Luke nod                                                              “he has a point but in the town there is a chance that we could run into trouble.” He says stroking his chin in deep thought                               “what kind of trouble?” I ask. What could have a group of lycans so averse to exposing themselves                                                       “Hunters? The hunters have grown more aggressive in recent times and have more power than ever. If we are found we could find ourselves in a one hell of a fight” Ryan says seriously                             “we need supplies. Our food is running low .We need to go into the town” Sarah adds and it throws and curveball in the mix.                                                                     “How would they know that your lycans?” I ask                                               “our D.n.a. after our first change our DNA has completely changed to a mix of wolf and human.” Ryan explains and a lightbulb lights above my head                                                                         “I haven’t changed yet. I can go into the town and get the supplies” I say and the others smile                                                                 “that might have worked but there is one problem. We have practice shoplifting you don’t” Luke says and my jaw drops                                “you didn’t think we had any money did you? A few lycans work but that’s only to keep the packs home running.” Luke explains.                                                                                                                         “I’ve got an idea” I say and the three look at me confused                            “have you got any spare clothes?” I ask and Sarah looks at me puzzled.                                                                                                           “I think I might have some old clothes in here let me see Sarah says and dropping her bag starts rooting eventually pulling out a plain black long sleeve top and some tracksuit bottoms with torn knees.                                                                                                    “Perfect.” I say as I take them from her hands and set to tearing the top making holes in the fabric.                                                                   “Wait…..What are you doing?” Sarah protests as the fabric rips                        “I’m going to play the beggar” I reply and as the penny drops the trio look at me and smile.                                                                           “Are you sure about this Jason? We won’t be able to come in and help if things go sour? “Ryan asks concerned                                   “I’m sure. It’ll be fine” I reply hopefully sounding more confident than I feel.                                                                                                  “Do you see the tree in the field, stood on its own?” Ryan asks and I nod.                                                                                               “We will wait there. If you’re not there but sunset we will come looking for you” he says and I smile back. I’ve only known his for a day but I already feel under his wing.                                                  “What do you need?” I ask so I don’t come back with the wrong things.                                                                                                    “Tins of food, anything tinned and bottles of water” she says still angry about the clothes.                                                                            “Then I best get changed and go” I say and disappear to the side of the road hidden by the line of trees. Reappearing the three have to bite on their lip to stop themselves laughing.                                   “You better pull this off. That was my last spares” Sarah groans                  “Good luck Jason.” Ryan say and Luke gives a so long salute before the three head into the trees and hop over into the fields leaving me to head into town.                                                                                 As I walk ever closer to the town the nerves and doubts start to creep in. if I don’t pull this off then we have nothing or what if the hunters do somehow find me out. No. I’m not going to panic. I have a plan and if I stick by it I will succeed. A few cars whizz past paying me no attention driving too fast to see the “state” I’m in.                                                                                             only around fifty meters from the start of the little town the red brick houses fully visible I hear the purr of and engine behind me and rather than whizz past the sound gets louder and louder till the source pulls up next to me I find an old couple sat in the front a beaten up car that splutters as is stays still looking at me their eyes full of sympathy.                                                                             “Are you okay?” she asks her voice full of concern as if I was her son or grandson.                                                                                         “I was cycling nearby and I hit a rock or something and my bike threw me off and a tyre burst. I was hoping I might find a police station or something to call home and maybe get a meal.” I say trying to sound desperate and although I feel terrible lying to the old dear its necessary.                                                        “Oh I’m sorry dear there’s not station here. Not in a long time” she says and looking back to her husband they seem to exchange a thousand word with just their eyes and I see her begin to scramble in her little handbag and pull out a little purse.                                                                                       “There’s a little store in town you should be able to phone from and get yourself something to eat. I think they do some clothes too” she says smiling as she holds out a couple of rolled up notes. I take them hesitantly although every part of me wants to snatch it before it’s gone.                                                                                  “Th…th thank you.” I stammer and she just smiles. The husband looks over her shoulder and say nothing as he looks at me but I see sympathy in his eyes                                                                      “ I hope it helps and” she says before the engine pops and the beaten old car disappears into the distance leaving to watch the kind pair disappear. The kind pair I just played.                                            The town in smaller than I had thought with most of the houses empty, for sale signs in the windows. The streets are deserted. The only sound is of litter being blown down the street. The store the couple talked sticks out lick a sore thumb. While all the houses are red bricked, old style homes the store is sleek and modern, walking in a ding sounds and hurts my ears and a smell of blech makes my stomach churn.                                            Looking around I find the stores shelves almost empty only a few cans of beans and hotdogs remain. Picking them up I place them on the till and continue searching with the till deserted but there’s nothing left. The fridges are bare and the freezers chilling nothing. I head back to the till and still find it empty.                         “Hello? Is anyone here? I shout wondering what’s going on.                           “Y…You shouldn’t shout” a voice says whispers and a girl around nineteen old peeks out from behind the counter her long black hair a mess and her makeup up smuggled all over her face                             “ what’s going on? What happened here?” I ask unnerved                               “Wolves. Huge wolves bigger than cows. They destroyed everything, took everything” she sobs                                                          I don’t say anything frozen in fear. I know what it was. Werewolves.                                                                                                       “When?”  I ask forcefully                                                                                     “a few weeks ago. Since then everyone has left” she sobs but something doesn’t feel right. If home is anything to go by as being werewolf territory then they would have taken it a long time ago. What’s different here then there?”                                                    “So why did you stay?? I ask cautiously certain that somethings going on.                                                                                  “Oh I didn’t stay I’ve only been here for a few days.” She says rising from behind the counter and in her hand sits a silver gun her finger over the trigger.                                                                            “And who are you? Any human outside our ranks would have asked about the wolves or dismissed them. You didn’t” she says her voice now hard and threatening.                                                      “I…I” I stammer and she doesn’t move.                                                       “Give me your finger” she orders and I look her puzzled.                                “Give me your finger!” she repeats and grabs my wrist hard making me winces as she twists it palms side up.                                              She reaches into her pocket with her free hand and pulls out a little pot with a strange blue liquid inside.                                                             “Ow” I moan as she pricks me finger with a needle and quickly puts it into the pot and the blue liquid turns green. Only now does the penny drop as her face drops and her gun arm rises.                        Acting on instinct I backhand the gun arm and the bullet settles in the ceiling and the gun falls from her hand landing on the floor with a bang.  The woman grabs my hair and smacks my forehead on the counter and I fall back dazed shaking my head to clear the haze. The hunter wastes no time, hoping over the counter with a small silver blade in hand. I barely mange to duck out the way as she goes for my throat and shoulder tackle her to the floor. Slamming her hand into the ground the blade falls from her fingers and I pin down her wrists. Her struggling does nothing the strength rising in my blood and when she realises she isn’t getting free the realisation drains the colour from her skin.                                                                                                   “Go on kill Me.” she says defiant to the end                                                      “No.” I say and let go climbing off and letting her get up. I head back to the counter and reach up to my forehead expecting it to be swollen but find nothing. I pick up the cans of food and turn around to find the woman still stood there frozen on the spot.                                                                                                                      “ there’s hunter all through the town” she whispers as I walk past and I don’t reply quickly running out the door and back the way I came the tins in my pockets and hands jangling and making running harder.                                                                                             I don’t stop running till I’m almost back where we split and take a moment to catch my breath. It’s a good thing that I went alone or things could have been a lot worse. Hoping over the fence is made a lot more difficult by the weight of the tins in my pockets and as I fall over one falls out of my pocket \and rolls away down the road. Cursing my bad luck I abandon the escape with no time to go back. I have to get to the others and warn them. My thighs feel red raw running through the bobbly field the tins smacking harder against the same spot with every spot.   The large oak slowly gets closer and closer till I can almost smell the wood and I can see the other three sat in the shade and they must see me as they jump to their feet and run towards me obviously realising something must be wrong for me to be running so hard. The three move faster than I ever could the surface making no difference to them as they almost hover above it, their feet moving so fast and Sarah almost knocks me to the floor she clatters into me that hard.                                          “What’s wrong Jason?” she asks her eyes prying                                              “the town….. Werewolves attacked it...” I pant and the others exchange uneasy glances                                                                                     “the werewolves are done but now hunters are there……” I finish and unease turns to fear.                                                                           “Did they find you out? Do they know that you are one of us?” Ryan asks hopeful                                                                                            “yes... they tested my blood in some pot” I tell him and his face drops a thousand miles                                                                                    “we need to get back quickly. We can’t stop” Ryan declares turning to walk back to the tree                                                                       “I’m guessing this is bad” I say hoping someone will tell me what this means                                                                                                “They have been checking blood for ages Jason. We aren’t the only ones that were looking for you. The hunters have been searching for you too. You are the lycan to lead us to freedom. You are the lycan that the hunters fear and know that they know who you are and what you look like they will stop at nothing to find you” Ryan says and my heart stops                                         “but I don’t even know what I am! I’m more confused than I have ever been. I’m told I’m a monster I’ve only ever seen in film and suddenly everyone is after me. “I shout the emotion getting the best of me                                                                                         “I’ve lost everything. My family, my home and now you’re saying I’ve now got a huge target on my back.” I say almost whispering to myself and I can feel a fire burning through my blood.                                                                                                          “You want to know what you are. Don’t fight the fire let it consume you become the lycan you was born to be” Ryan coaches almost daring me before looking at the other two and they begin backing away. I want to ask why but my voice is gone. My body isn’t mine to control anymore. I can see my arms grow longer and my fingers and nails become claws. My body grow and widens. I feel no pain and that surprises me. My body is changing but it feels almost natural, like my body was already suited to it. I feel my teeth lengthen and sharpen. My sight goes fuzzy and then comes back sharper than ever. My nose does bling then comes back burning with new smells. My ears pop and the world sounds louder and crisper. My nose to my chin extrudes outwards my nose becoming part of my face forming a wolven muzzle. Looking at the others I find them looking at me half afraid. I stand there taking in what I am. Looking down I find myself covered in coal black fur and my ripped clothes lay on the floor now in ribbons. I breathe deeply and the others slowly walk back towards me.                                                   “Jason. Is that you?” Luke asks weary and I nod in response but I sniff I get a sniff of something cold and metal and turning around I see nothing but the smell sets alarm bells ringing in my mind. A deep growl rumbles in my lips and I dart across the ground running on all fours following the smell and slow slightly as I close in on the smell. I can hear the others running behind me begging me to stop but this smell is of something dangerous and as I arrive at the trees I stop and rise to two feet. My claws drag through the trees making a horrid scratching noise making deep cuts into the wood and I hear it a quick gasp of fear and I spin round to find myself face to face with the same girl from the store. Her teeth start to chatter as we come face to face and she slowly starts to back away. I follow out of curiosity forgetting how terrifying I must look and she turns to bolt landing on her face and a small pot rolls from her pocket in front of her and into the hand of Ryan.                                                               “The blood test. Why do you still have it?” he growls threateningly heaving her to her feet with ease.                                                                                                        “Because he spared my life” she says simply and he look at me questioningly and I nod to confirm it.                                                             “I was going to kill him but he stopped me and had me but refused to kill me. I’ve been questioning everything since. They said lycans and werewolves are killers yet he spared Me.” she says turning to face me the fear gone and the fear is gone replaced by something else.                                                                                  “ I couldn’t take this to them and sign the death warrant of someone that spared my life” she says as the other two arrive and the fact she’s still alive confuses them till Luke sums it up in one sentence                                                                                                       “he spared her so she is saving him” he says handing him the pot.                                                                                                                    “No one knows he was even there. I told them I feel and my gun misfired. They didn’t pry” she says before Ryan can say a word.                                                                                                               “Now what are you doing to do? Go back to them?” Ryan asks curious.                                                                                                           “I don’t know. They have raised me but after today I feel manipulated. If they lied to me about this what else did they lie about?” She says and I see in her as almost a kindred spirit.                                            Focusing I try to change back. I picture myself human. Hands feet, toes and fingers and slowly I feel myself become me again.                                                                                                                   “She could come with us. She knows the hunters and can help us avoid them” I say and the three look at me like a madman                       “a human travel with us? She wouldn’t be able to keep up. We don’t have the supplies and she could just wait till we are asleep and slit our throats. The hunters would welcome her as a hero and all hope would be lost.” Luke protest an anger in his fierce gaze                                                                                               “so because she’s human she isn’t trustable?” I reply outraged.                        “ what is I wasn’t human?” she says and everything stops and all eyes fall on her and she rolls up the bottom of her trouser leg to reveal a very poorly bandaged wound. Ripping off the bandage she reveals five deep puncture wounds all healed but leaving five light pink patches each a different shape.                                   “You’re a werewolf?” I say hesitantly                                                                  “I haven’t changed yet it was only yesterday. One of the werewolves was running and I chased it down. I was about to kill it when it looked at me and I say the human behind the fur and I froze. This is what I got for freezing. No one else saw and I kept it hidden. Till now. If they had found out” she explains and I can see the gears turning in Ryan’s head.                                                 “Where we are going you won’t be welcome. I will not be able to guarantee your safety when we get there.” Ryan says and the girl nods                                                                                                               “I understand. I don’t expect you too” she replies simply and the trio turn their backs to her like a scorned child and slowly make their way back to the tree to get their things.                                           “Thank you for not giving it to them” I say to the girl as she brushes herself down.                                                                                         “Thank you for not killing me” she replies smiling her teeth perfectly straight and white.                                                                                “No problem. If I can be so bold I think it might be a good idea to get rid of the silver” I say to her raising an eyebrow                                     “I guess but then what will I defend myself with?” she says slowly unsheathing the silver knife from its holding. The smell of it sets my stomach churning the smell so acidic it burns the inside of my nose.                                                                                               “I’ll protect you” I reply and her cheeks go a light rosy red and a shy smile touches her lips.                                                                              “And what is the name of my brave protector?” she laughs but the simple question makes me ask myself the same question. If what Ryan said is true then maybe my name isn’t what I believe it to be.                                                                                                                “The strong silent type hey” she laughs playfully punching me on the arm                                                                                                           “No. they say I was kidnapped by hunters as a baby so I don’t know if that’s my name or of its something different” I tell her opening up to the girl that tried to kill me.                                                         “Well do find out and then tell me. Lucy is waiting” she says trying to lighten my mood as she drops the blade into the ground leaving stand in the mud and leaves me to walk over to Ryan alone.                                                                                                         “You want to know what your name is” Ryan says as I join his side and I’m not surprised he heard. Since I changed my senses have become amazing. I can smell things buried in the ground. I can smell the different trees in the distance each one different. I can hear the cows walking in the field next door chewing, I can see the pattern on the butterflies in the distance.                                        “Yes. Am I who I say I am?” I reply thinking how strange it will be if I have a different name.                                                                        “They hadn’t given you a first name but your surname is Umbrian.” He says and walks on as I stand there feeling all the pieces start to fit together.                                                                                 “So do you know your name” Lucy laughs re-joining my side                                “yes. I’m Jason. Jason Umbrian” I reply and she smiles                                     “Umbrian?” she asks and I nod                                                                       “I’ve seen that name somewhere before” she says and my heart leaps                                                                                                                   “where?” I ask eagerly hoping it might help me discover where I came from                                                                                                                      “I can’t think of where I saw it. Sorry” she says with an apologetic smile.                                                                                                “At least I know there’s a chance I might find family” I reply smiling but it’s a fake smile. Things have been happening so fast that I haven’t been able to think about the fact my family and what was my family. Did they actually care about me or was it all just an act, birthdays, Christmas. Finishing school did it mean a thing or was it all lies. Was it them that took me or was it someone else? Everything I think I am is a lie. I don’t know who I am anymore. I have my name but who were my parents, what where they like do I have any relatives left? So many questions I don’t have the answers to.                                                              “Hey Jason you okay?” Luke asks joining my side. I was so lost in thought I find myself on the other side of the field looking over at a field of green and the setting sun.                                                       “I’m okay. It’s just a lot to take in” I reply slightly surprised by the concern from the normally cold Luke.                                                       “I can’t say I understand how you feel but I want you to know that although you may feel alone and afraid don’t. This may not be the family or friends you imagined having or the path you saw yourself taking but I believe that we are put on different paths for a reason. Living as a lycan is hard, moving, hiding, and fighting. You have had the chance to live in peace and see the world differently and humanity in a different light. Most lycans have a deep hatred for humanity, I had a hatred for humanity” he says and I’m slightly taken aback from the bluntness in his tone no envy or jealousy just points it out for me to see                                                                                                               “Had?” I ask and he smiles                                                                                “you and the werewolf have shown me that maybe judging a whole race by the actions of a few isn’t right. The hunters think we are all monsters because of the actions of a few and we judge them the same. Both sides hatred keeps the fighting going. Just by sparing her life today you broke the belief of one hunter and one lycan.”                                                                                 He says almost admiring the fact I spared her.                                                                                              “I just done what felt right” I shrug and we stand there watching the sun set before we have to set off and reach the pack that was to be my new family and find the home that was ripped from me.                                                                                                                                                          











                    



Returning Home
“How did you end up with these lot anyway?” Lucy asks as we walk through the fields. Since the last town we decided it’s too much of a risk and stuck to the fields.                                                               “I was looking for my friend that had disappeared. Sarah and Luke came looking for me and I ran. They caught me as their wolves and Luke turned me.” I tell her not afraid to share                                   “did you find your friend?” she asks holding onto my arm                               “rather he found me. I was on the floor bleeding and he found me then left me” I tell her the words leaving a sour taste in my mouth.                                                                                                         “Why on earth did he do that?” she cries outraged                                        “because I was a lycan and he’s a werewolf” I tell her and she stops dead.                                                                                                         “He left you to lay there bleeding and afraid because you was different. Some friend” she snorts wrapping her arm around mine and her touch calms my dormant anger.                                                  “What about you how did you end up with the hunters?” I ask curious about the girl that always seems to be smiling.                                      “I was put into care at around five and the couple that adopted me were hunters. They told about how you are monsters that do round killing people and such and offered me a chance to join. I agreed and was soon sent off to the group you found me with and now I’m here. With a group of strangers, one of whom tried to kill me now a werewolf and heading to a lycan pack.” She says giggling towards the end.                                                                           “Quite the tale” I laugh her giggle infectious                                                    “nothing compared to yours. Abducted child of legend, raised by the enemy to be found and return home” she says speaking like a salesman selling an idea.                                                                       We walk along together and her presence at my side makes me feel happier than I have felt in a long time. Maybe is the slight skip in every step or the brightness in her gaze since she joined us.                                                                                                                     “Jason!” she cries suddenly and falls to the floor sobbing in pain.                                                                                                                   “Lucy!” I respond falling to her side before being pulled back by Luke.                                                                                                                  “It’s okay Jason she’s changing. It’s not easy for most people on their first turn.” He says into my ear and let’s go and I’m straight back to her side                                                                                              “it’s okay Lucy I’m here. You’re changing its going to be okay” I whisper as she changes unable to respond. Her arms and legs shorten and move to below her body. Her spine grows outwards covered in a mix of white and light grey. Her hands and feet shorten and form paws. When finished she stands there on four paws as high as my shoulders. Her light blue eyes looking around nervously her clothes lay on the floor ruined, her body now covered in light grey and white fur.                                                      “It’s okay Lucy I’m here” I sooth and she turns her head to face me and I can see the fear in her eyes.                                                            
She walks around slowly but soon realises how easy it is and is soon running and jumping obviously pleased with herself and we watch on with a smile our face.                                                                 “I’m sorry Lucy but you’re going to have to change back if anyone sees…” Ryan says and she shakes her head nodding towards the bundle of ruined clothes.                                                                                    “We are almost there now. You can surely put them back on till then” he groans and she shakes her head again and looks at both me and Luke and it doesn’t take a genius to work out the problem.                                                                                                            “Come on Lucy we can head down the field a bit and I’ll hold up a towel” Sarah laughs picking up Lucy’s clothes and her bag before the pair walk off leaving the three of us to sit and twiddle our thumbs.                                                                                           “Did you know my parents Ryan?” I ask hopeful                                             “I knew them quite well but then everyone did. Your dad was the alpha of the pack. The leader.” He says looking down at his feet                                                                                                             “so who’s in charge now” I ask curious and Ryan says nothing                                                                                                         “I think it’s safe to tell him now Ryan” Luke says and Ryan shoots his a glare of daggers.                                                                         “Tell me what?” I ask my curiosity raised                                                         “the pack we are going to isn’t just some random pack. This is your pack. They are the lycans that had you not been taken would have been your family and the alpha of that pack is my dad.” Luke says                                                                                       “and you didn’t want to tell me this because?”                                           “Because he might not welcome you with open arms, without an Umbrian as alpha he was the only option and once wolves climb up the ladder they don’t want to go back down.” Ryan says shaking his head obviously angry at Luke for telling me                           “then why did you find me?” I ask my excitement turning to fear.                                                                                                                            “Because he banished us, we argued you had to be found but he wouldn’t have it. He told us to leave and never return.” Luke says and the sile disappears as quickly as it appeared.                                        “So I’m going home but the alpha, my uncle doesn’t want me there and you three aren’t welcome there. I guessing this is going to all blow up when we get there.” I say and neither of them reply.                                                                                                      “Let’s say we get there and he wants us to leave what happens then? I ask irritated I’ve only been told this now.                                                   “Then there will be only one option. I’ll have to challenge him for the right to be alpha” Luke says and Ryan’s outraged                                 “are you crazy Luke!? He would tear you apart” Ryan shouts                             “we have no other choice hopefully the fact Jason’s there dad will see sense and step down.” Luke says sadly and a tint of fear coats his voice.                                                                                          “Is he like me?” I ask not sure how to phrase the question.                              “A descendent, no. only your family is not the pack” Ryan explains                                                                                                             “then ill challenge him” I proclaim and the other two look at me like I’ve gone crazy.                                                                                    “ you said it yourself I’m stronger and faster than any other lycan” I argue before they start but they argue anyway                                        “ that may be but you don’t have a clue how to fight, especially not as a lycan, you’ve only been a lycan once for not even five minutes” Ryan protests                                                                                       “ if he fights like he does as a human as a lycan there won’t be a problem” Lucy says behind me and turning around I find her stood with Sarah her clothes torn and stretched but wearable.                           “I’ve seen other lycans fight and none where as fast as you were as a human.”                                                                                              “He’s right you two, he’s the one that has to fight Leon. He has to prove he’s more than just a name.” Sarah adds and the pair are left speechless.                                                                                                    “I’m not afraid. This is what I was meant for.” I say softer the tension lifting.                                                                                                 “I would have been alpha after my father if I wasn’t taken so it’s only right I fight for it myself” I add and the pair nod reluctantly.                                                                                                       “You do realise that once you demand it there is no going back and it’s a fight to the very end?” Luke asks sadly                                               “so I’d have to……” I ask and he nods glumly                                                    “and you are okay with that?” I ask and he shakes his head                             “I’m not okay with it, he’s still my father but the power of being alpha went to his head. He’s not the man he was.” he says sadly before rising and walking away. I start to follow but Ryan shakes his head and I sit back down.                                                             “Leave him go Jason. He has lost a lot” Ryan says sadly                                   “he could have stayed. Been alpha after his father you know?”                     “Then why didn’t he?”                                                                                 “Because he wanted to find you, this whole journey was his idea. He wanted to hunt you down. He wanted to find his cousin.” He says quietly almost afraid of being heard. Sarah and Lucy sit there listening intently                                                              “then is his dad my uncle?” I ask                                                                           “yes by law, he’s married to your mothers sister” he explains and a smile crosses my lips                                                              “I have an aunt?” I ask and he smiles                                                           “yes Jason you have an aunt and uncle” he says and then the realisation hits me                                                                                          “and I’m about to widow her” I say solemnly                                                        “no you will be saving her. My father is a horrid man, violent and abusive. The pack is falling apart with him in charge. Only by you killing him will you save the pack” Luke says reappearing his eyes firm but the skin around them remains red and wet.                                                                                                      “I’m ready to fight him but I don’t know if I’m ready to be an alpha. I know nothing about your world” I say nerves hitting me hard.                                                                                                          “You are an alpha Jason. I’ve seen it from the first moment I saw you, you refused to back down to me on the first day we met, you were willing to risk everything for us by going into the town alone and you showed a wealth of compassion is sparing Lucy. Courage, compassion and self-sacrifice. Three things an alpha must be, three things you are.” Luke says proudly and looking around me I see the feelings echoed on the face of everyone else there.                                                                              “We will be at your side Jason. All of us” Lucy adds and I look at her shocked                                                                                                “don’t you look at me like that I’m never leaving your side” she snaps                                                                                                                   “nor am I” ads Sarah                                                                                          “I’m not going anywhere. We are all in this together till the end” Ryan adds and the show of support makes my eyes fill with water.                                                                                                   “ then let’s go back home, all of us” I declare and with our heats full of pride and friendship rather than fear we head back home, them to the home they know and was ripped from them and me to my new home.                                                                                                As we pass through the next field what must be the packs home comes into view. A large but crumbling down what must have been a manor house. The once beautiful garden once tended to by staff is now and weed paradise, the walls are covered in climbing plants, the bricks underneath hidden. The closer we get the worse it looks and I wonder if it has always been like that or is it only now.                                                                                     “It looks terrible doesn’t it Jason? It wasn’t always like that. Once it was beautiful with so many people there the work was always done and it looked beautiful.” Ryan says nostalgically and the sight of the building seems to hurt him more than anything else.                                                                                                      “I know it might be tempting but no one change or we will be in more trouble than we are already in” Ryan commands and there’s a silent agreement                                                                               “oh look here comes the welcoming committee” Luke laughs and in the distance I can see them three people walking towards us and within a few minutes we are face to face. The first is a man in his early thirty’s, his bald head a stark contrast to his long light brown beard. Slightly overweight but moves with the grace of a dancer. The second is a cold and sharp women every part of her anatomy slim and extruded, her eyes colder than ice and harder than stone and finally in front is a man who stands with the posture of a queen with light wispy grey hair and dressed in peculiar black and white suit.                                                              “Don’t take this the wrong way when say I’m glad to see you but you aren’t welcome here” the suited man says sounding genuinely pleased                                                                                                   “good to see you too old friend. We will be welcome. Have you met my new companion?” he asks and the trio’s eyes fall on me.                                                                                                                    “And you are?” the man asks the warmth done from his tone                         “Jason. Jason Umbrian” I reply simply and their jaws drop to the ground.                                                                                                      “It can’t be! You found him?” the old man cheers almost leaping off the floor                                                                                       “we kind of found each other.” Ryan chuckles and everything seems to be going smoothly till the chubby man sniffs and his eyes fall straight onto Lucy.                                                                            “You brought a werewolf with you!?” he roars outraged stomping towards her but freezes as a growl escapes my throat                            “you think I’m afraid of you boy?! Come here and we can see if you are an Umbrian” he growls back and I can only take a step before Ryan places a restraining hand on my shoulder.                                “That werewolf is a companion of ours and will be treated with the respect she deserves. He request an alpha to alpha meeting” Ryan says confidently                                                                                      “ you are aware that by doing so you are declaring yourself a separate pack, you forfeit all affiliation with us” the suit asks and Ryan nods                                                                                                    “ I do” he says reluctantly. That’s it all our eggs have been thrown into one basket.                                                                                              “ and who is your pack’s alpha?” he ask looking at each of us one by one                                                                                                       “ I am” I declare and the man smiles almost expecting it                             “ well then if you would follow me and I’ll take you to the alpha” he says turning around and the trio walk ahead of us the fat one grumbling under his breath. 
At the house it’s not long till a crowd has gathered. Whispering and murmuring as we walk together. Many growl deeply at Lucy and make threats but she stands tall and smiles back. heading inside we find it in a better state the hallways are clean and airy an look freshly painted, pieces of wooden furniture and framed pictures cover the hall way before he have to head up the stairs in a single file line and final come to our stop. He suited man opens the door and straight away must regret it as he’s hit by a wave of abuse                                                                                      “didn’t I tell you I didn’t want to be disturbed! You stupid excuse for a lycan! A gruff voice shouts and you can hear him take a vulgar glug from a bottle before throwing across the room. The bottle must have been intended for the suit but I move faster than anyone can stop me and get in the way catching the bottle mid-flight and I see the thrower.                                        Long oily shabby hair covers his forehead and a beard covers the rest the hair dampened by spilled liquor. He clothes are filthy and he stinks of sweat booze and things I don’t want to think about. If the man sent to greet us was fat he is obese his stomach poking out his top and his trousers under great strain. A strong odour of the worst cheese wafts from his bare feet.                               “Who the bloody hell are you?” he shout jumping to his feet outraged at my intervention.                                                                              “I’m Jason Umbrian. I asked for this meeting” I say simply repulsed by the man                                                                                            “Lies! The Umbrian’s are gone!” he shouts outraged squaring up to me and I don’t back down. This mans as intimidating as my little sister (yes I still think of Lauren and David as my brother and sister)                                                                                      “no dad they aren’t” Luke says stepping into the doorway and the colour drains from his face.                                                                        “You aren’t welcome here anymore” Leon hisses and Luke doesn’t move or respond                                                                                  “so what do want Jason? Why did you call this meeting and bring all those I sent away back?” the man’s spews spit covering my face as he slurs                                                                                           “I’m here to take back my parents pack. I’m here to challenge you” I say my eyes burning and my blood burning.                                       “And if I refuse?” he says and it’s the chubby man that speaks                         “you can’t refuse, an alpha is obliged to defend his right to lead. To deny his challenge is to be disgraced by your pack and banished” he says his voice blunt and strong. Leon backs away from me terrified.                                                                                            “Okay….okay but we do it outside” he says and barges past us to be in front as we head down the stairs and back out the front door to find what looks like everyone has gathered to see what’s going on. Leon stops in what must be the courtyard a bare square of concreate.                                                                                             “This is my territory and we shall fight by my rules” he says and eyebrows are raised everywhere.                                                               “ there is no rules” I reply coldly and start to change almost enjoying being able to change I stand there and wait for him to change and looking at him in wolf form is almost comical the belly remains and looks horribly out of place and his eyes can’t focus from whatever he was drinking.                                                            I march on him straight away and swing for his face with open claws. His duck isn’t fast enough and the last two claws catch the side of his cheek. He leaps at me and we roll across the floor both our jaws snapping open and shut searching for the others skin but finding only air. Using the muscles in my legs I kick him off and he flies through the air landing back where we started with a thud. I quickly pull myself to my feet and run across the gap between us and give him a swift boot to the chest sending him rolling wheezing, blood dripping from his mouth. He lays there with his back to the floor and I take my time walking over. Standing over him he swings a feeble paw at my chest that I catch in my own and yank pulling him to his feet only to head-butt him back down. Blood stains my head and I’m not sure if it’s his or mine the collision has stars circling but not for long. Looking down I find him changing back as he slowly crawls away from me his nose horribly broken and his entire chest black and blue. Confused I look round hoping to see a friend for guidance but find no one. I’m alone. And as I watch him crawl away slower than a snail I change back my head throbbing and my body covered in scuffs from the tumble and sting at the touch of the cool breeze.                                “You win…okay…you…” Leon pleads holding up his hands in surrender.                                                                                                       “No that’s not how this works you know that” I reply my voice mocking.                                                                                                       “You can’t kill me” he says a smug smile crossing his face                                 “and why not that’s how this works”                                                                  “because…because” he stammers. I just shake my head and tut                      “because if you do I’ll kill her” a woman hisses behind me. Turning around I find Sarah walk out from the crowd, holding a knife to Lucy’s throat.                                                                                      “What are doing Sarah I thought…?” I start but she buts in                            “you thought that you could wander in her and ruin everything.  I was promised to become his mate as alpha if I killed you but you had to ruin it so you are going to walk away and leave taking your werewhore with you” she shouts and I slowly back away from Leon holding my hands in the air.                                               “You don’t need to do this Sarah.” I sooth hoping to convince her but she says nothing her gaze fixed on me.                                               “Do think we will just take you as alphas because you threaten one when you were beaten? We will not take you as alpha anymore” a stranger in the crowd says and soon everyone is in arms and the colour drains from Sarah’s face.                                                     “Let her go Sarah. Please” I ask hoping there is some chance she will let go. Slowly she lowers the knife and drops it to the floor. Lucy now free starts to walk towards me then stops, winks at me and spins around with a right hook that knocks Sarah to the floor in heap out cold.                                                                   “Don’t call me names you will hurt my feelings” Lucy says kicking the fallen girl. I’m at her side the blink of an eye lifting her chin so her eyes meet mine before gently brushing her hair behind her ear                                                                                     “are you okay?” I ask tenderly                                                                          “no that punch hurt my hand” she laughs and I hold her close.                “I’m not letting you out my sight again” I whisper in her ear and I want nothing more than to stay there but there is another matter I have to deal with.                                                                              I find Leon still laying there still bleeding and trembling his eyes on the fallen Sarah but I’m not the first one to him                                 “You what! You would leave mum and have her?!” Luke roars outraged as he emerges from the crowd his body mid change and as I start to intervene Lucy place her hand on my shoulder and whispers                                                                                                  “I think you have done enough. Let him have it out” and as I watch him walk towards him fuming as he changes I realise that I can’t let him.                                                                                                 “Luke! Don’t” I shout and he looks at me confused and angry at my intervention.                                                                                       “You will never forgive yourself for this” I say as I walk towards him.                                                                                                         “He’s an animal, a disgusting waste of space that just tried to kill Lucy and destroy my mother’s heart and you want me to let him go?!” he roars spiting over his own father.                                                “No I don’t want him to go free” I reply placing a hand on his shoulder and glaring hard at the trembling Leon                                           “this task falls to me not you. The fight isn’t over till one side is dead” I say aloud for all to hear and slowly Luke changes back and walks over leaving me looming over the crippled excuse for a lycan. Reaching down I pick up the knife that was held to Lucy’s throat a moment ago and bring it to his. I do it quick and hard not giving myself a chance to hesitate or for him to plead and as the blood stains my hand and the life leaves his eyes everyone around me cheers and chants. Congratulating me and patting my back. In the whirlwind of excitement I don’t get to check on my friend but I do him say in a mix of joy and sorrow                                                                                                    “the true alpha is home”                                                                              
“Stop moving you big baby” Anne groans as I squirm once more as the damp cloths press against the side of my head. It turns out that the blood was both mine and his and it fine till someone touches it.                                                                                           “I told you its fine” I argue but the old woman just shushes me and continues to dab at the wound and shakes her head.                                     “I can’t do it like this, I’m going to have to get rid of some of this hair” she says disappearing searching for some clippers and I consider leaving but Lucy would shoot me, as would Anna.                             When she repairers she holding both a set of clippers and a pair of scissors.                                                                                               “ god boy its only hair no need to feel emotional” she laughs at my distraught expression before setting to work snipping at my hair and the curl fall to my feet and the sight saddens me.                            “oh lord” Anne gasps before putting down the scissors and says to me quietly                                                                                                  “you might want to hold onto something” and I grab hold of the arms of the wooden chair hard and just in till as I feel her pull at something in my head and it takes all my willpower not to scream but once it stops I can feel the wound heal in seconds and looking at Anne hoping she holds out the problem. One of Leon’s fangs had snapped off and lodged itself into my head and as she drops it into my hand still red with my own blood a wave of guilt comes over me. I took his life I killed him and I can never take that back.                                                                                          “Don’t you dare start feeling guilty!” Anne snaps and I look at her stunned                                                                                                        “he made life here for everyone a misery, he abused anyone weaker and almost destroyed this pack. You have saved this pack and you saved Luke from a guilt that could have driven him mad. Sometimes the wrong thing is the right thing to do”                          “but what if…” I start but her normal warm gaze has gone hard and stops me in my tracks                                                                                “don’t start what if’ing. What could happen doesn’t matter. What matters is what is happening.” She remarks and I nod my head in agreement.                                                                                             “I guess that’s a perk of being an Umbrian, not all of us heal like that, we heal fast a broken bone mends in a couple of days but that’s amazing even by our standards” she notes drily as she cuts over the rest of my hair to make it level                                                                        “I didn’t know that, I don’t know much about anything. How am I going to lead a pack when I know nothing about the pack?” I ask her finding the old woman’s counsel wise and blunt. She puts it as it simply and I like that. No sugar coating the truth with Anne.                                                                                                “The same way you lead the group you travelled here with. Listen to those around you, led by example. The pack is only as good as its alpha, an alpha must mot lie or fail his promises or the pack will fall apart. The only thing holding us together before you arrived was hope monkey see monkey do. In normal times Leon would have been taken down straight away” she says her voice whispering off towards the end                                                                                                       “normal times?” I ask and I hear her exhale deeply at the question.                                                                                                            “The hunters have hunted us to the edge of extinction. The packs around the wold have lost contact. There is so few of us left that we can’t afford to fight like we used to. The word thinks we are monsters, myths but we have lives, friends, and family. We bleed the same blood and feel the same pain. Does being different mean we are dangerous. A few bad apples don’t always mean that the bunch is bad.” she ends with and I feel like it’s a topic she wants to drop so I do thinking over it myself to the gentle hum of the clippers and wonder if maybe this is what they mean by I will bring freedom, maybe I’m supposed to reunite the lycans and werewolves and stop the hunters. I lose myself so deep in thought about it that I barely notice the absence of a gentle hum and realise Anne has finished. Running a hand through my hair I realise that thankfully it’s not as short as I feared it would be but the curls that I once hate but grew on me now lay on the floor.                                        “I wonder what your girlfriend will think of the new cut” Anne laughs                                                                                                                    “I don’t…..”                                                                                                         “Oh come off it Jason. That werewolf girl has your heart in her palm. I saw the way your heart dropped when she was in danger and his way you ran to her. That’s love boy and we lycans only have one chance at love” she says sadness tainting her voice                                                                                                          “what do you mean one chance at love?” I ask curious                                     “we lycans are and old fashioned bunch. We don’t marry like humans do but nor are we animals. We are what we call mated. This is our marriage but it’s far more binging. Each party presents the other with a vial of their own blood which is dubbed over their forehead by each party’s family. The alpha wold say a few words and its over but there is old magic at work. The blood vanishes and from then out both lycans can see the others emotions. They will know any pain, sadness that the other feels or there happiness.” She explains and while I’m sure I have a long while yet till I would even consider it there is no reason why I can’t find it interesting.                                                         “But you’re only…… how old are you?” she asks almost surprised that she doesn’t know                                                                        “I’m eight…..no I’m nineteen. My birthday was a few days ago” I tell her and she looks at me outraged.                                                            “And no one did anything?! Ryan and I will be having words!” she scowls and I smile                                                                                    “its okay Anne. I forgot about it myself.” I tell her but she’s not satisfied                                                                                                         “no this won’t do at all.” She moans and disappears out the room leaving me to follow and find my way around my new home.
More rooms than I can count but most have been converted into bedrooms full of bunkbeds with one or two draws, most belongings stored in bags. As I walk down the hallway people greet me by the name of alpha rather than my name and it unsettles me a bit. They have placed their faith in me and I hope I can repay it.                                                                                              “there you are I’ve been looking for you for ages” the familiar voice of Lucy laughs behind me                                                                       “sorry it took a bit longer than thought to clean and I guess I got lost in the hallways” I chuckle and before I can ask why she’s grabbed my arm and is dragging me down the hall way and outside where Luke and a woman in her thirties is waiting. Her long hair a light blonde and her eyes are the same icy blue as Luke but her face is warm and kind and as Lucy disappears as quickly as she appeared                                                                                                   “I can’t believe it. I see you but I still can’t believe it” she sobs her eyes leaking happy tears                                                                                “Jason meet my mum, your auntie” Luke says a happy smile creeping onto his face. walking over slowly she wraps her arms around me and squeezes so tight my ribs creak                                    “ thank god for bringing you home to us safely” she sobs before letting go.                                                                                                        “What happened to you hair? The stress of being alpha getting to you?” Luke laughs and I shake my head smiling                                              “not yet, Anne had to cut some of it away to clean me up so it all had to be trimmed” I tell him and memory of what and I who I just killed hits hard and I see it hit them too                                            “sorry I…”                                                                                                         “Don’t be. He wasn’t the same man I mated with. You done what had to be done and what should have been done” she says firmly and I see the same strength of spirit that Luke possesses.                        “Jason!” Ryan shout flying around the corner and almost crashing to the floor                                                                                              “what’s wrong Ryan?!” I ask startled                                                                    “it’s Lucy. Some of the lycans are…” he starts but I don’t let him finish                                                                                                                  “where!?” I growl and he waves back to where we came from and I’m gone running as fast as my legs can carry me a growl trembling my throat and I leave them to follow behind as I find them.
A circle of lycans all crowded around one person. Lucy                                      “what’s going on here!?” I shout and everyone freezes turning to face me and breaking away to reveal Lucy in her wolven shape growling and snapping but also limping and bleeding.                           I dart to her side and I’m outraged to see her light fur stained red.                                                                                                                     “Who don’t this?” I growl still holding Lucy closes and calming her down. No one answers                                                                                  “WHO…..DONE……THIS?” I roar leaving Lucy’s side as turning to look at everyone in the crowd and all step back other than three men. All at least six foot and build like tanks stay stood there arms crosses looking almost pleased with their work.                                                                                                                    “We did” the biggest of the three says plainly as if this is nothing.                                                                                                                   He doesn’t get a chance to move as I leap across the space between us and knock him to the floor. I land blow after blow to his head and feel his nose crumble up under my fist. Two pairs of arms grab me from behind and toss me off but only onto my feet and pull the other man up. The crowd separates and makes a circle like kids watching a fight at school but no one is cheering, they watch intently as the three break apart and circle me and Lucy looking to jump me on three sides. Looking around me for a way to at least get Lucy out of harm’s way I find Anne stood in the crowd with other woman stood at her side their arms ready and she mouths the words                                                        “throw her”                                                                                                    I wrap my arms around her quickly and she groans in discomfort but I don’t stop swinging around and tossing her in the direction of Anne and her friends. Holding out their arms she lands in their grasp but knocks them back and only with the help of those behind them do they stay on their feet. The crowd consumes her and the three are outraged their gazes fixed on me.                                                                                                                   “How dare you bring a werewolf here!” the man with a broken nose growls but doesn’t make a move on me as they continue to circle me.                                                                                                         “I’m going to give you one chance, the three of you. Leave now and I won’t hurt you any more” I say calmly composing myself.                                                                                                             “Funny. I said the same thing to her” he laughs and the pair at my sides rush me expecting to take me of guard ducking under the left attackers swing I swing with my left and feel his ribs bend under the blow. The left attacker swings for where my head now is and I feel the air moves as it slides just past my ear as the breezes tickles my head. Distracted I don’t have time to react to the man with a broken nose and catch a kick to the side of the head. The kick sends me to the floor dizzy I crawl trying to get room but they are on my quickly grabbing me by my arms and twisting them behind my back and I don’t struggle, it would be pointless.                                                                                        “You broke my nose boy, now I’m going to break your jaw” the man laughs as sends a right hook swinging and I’m seeing starts. Blood fills my mouth and I spit it into his face.                                          “ I’m going to say this once, let go now and I might not kill you” I growl and feel myself start to change but find myself stopped dead by a quick combination of left and right.                                   “Your no Umbrian, you are no alpha” he laughs and the rag boils over, I don’t change but I feel the strength in my limps return.                                                                                                               He swings an uppercut towards my stomach and I react faster using the strength in my legs to push myself backwards and the three of us fall to the floor, they let go and I roll to my feet. One start to rise but a swift kick to the temple and I doubt he’s going to rise for a long time. The other of the pair outraged swings for my temple which I simply block with my arm swinging with the other cracking into the side of his ribs and I feel them snap this time the previous blow softening them for now. The pair lay on the floor not moving and the final third stands there frozen in fear.                                                                                                                    “ you should have ran” I growl and he turns to run with his tail between his legs but since the fight began both Luke and Ryan have arrived and worked their way through the crowd. The numbers game is now in my favour                                                              “ neither of you do anything unless he tries to flee, this is my fight” I order my voice sounding nothing like mine almost relishing the fight and the pair step back staying ready to stop any attempt to flee.                                                                                      Realising that he’s got no alternative he charges at me and swings a wild right hand ducking me fire a left handed punch straight into his chest. The combination of his momentum and m strength sets his ribs shattering and he falls to his knees wheezing.                                                                                                            I circle back around him and look him straight in the eye as he kneels there and for a moment I stop. My mind so torn, my human morality and my lycan instinct waging war over his life. I can hear the other two still breathing as I stand there and I look at the man in front of me I’m lost as to what to do. Looking at the crowd in front of me I see Luke and Ryan stood there waiting and as I see all those watching then look back at the man knelt in front of me I decide.                                                                                      “You will leave and never return. I will not accept anyone in this pack that attacks others who live here be them lycans or werewolves.” I order and pull him to his feet.                                                 He says nothing just walks past me, his friends joining his side. The crowd parts like the sea for Moses and as the three disappear into the distance I wonder if I’ve made the right choice.                                                                                                            The crowd disperse as quickly as it had gathered and soon it’s only me, Luke and Ryan stood there once more.                                                  “You made the right call Jason” Luke smile clasping my shoulder sounding more like a wise uncle than a cousin of the same age.                                                                                      “They fear another tyrant like dad, today you should you are not what they fear” he adds and I smile grateful for the reassurance.                                                                                                       “Where’s Lucy?” I ask concerned about her                                                      “she’s gone with Anne Jason, she’s tending to her as we speak” Ryan replies and I set off in search off.                                             As we walk people look at me in a way new to me, slightly intimidated but there’s something else something I haven’t seen before.                                                                                                              “Why does everyone look at me like that?” I ask the pair hoping they know.                                                                                              “They admire you Jason” Ryan says simply and I’m dumbfounded                                                                                               “why admire me I have done nothing to deserve admiration” I reply                                                                                                                       “really? So you didn’t risk your life to become alpha? No one said you had to but you did.” Ryan says and the look in the eye says the same for him.                                                                                       coming back to the room I had only left an hour before I find Lucy now back as her human self-sat on the end of the table her beautiful smile a ghost of its normal self her lower thighs bandaged, the fabric of her top stretched by bandages                                       “ are you okay?” I ask holding her face in my hands turning it gently to find her cheek a dark grey bruise.                                                    “Werewolves don’t heal like us” Anne explains before I can even ask the question.                                                                                      “It’s fine.” She says waving away my concerns                                               “no it’s not fine, I shouldn’t have left you alone” I apologise feeling guilty                                                                                                  “no you shouldn’t have to, I’ll leave in the morning” she says dejectedly                                                                                                               “No.” I burst out and she looks at me stunned                                                  “you are family and this is your home” I declare and he smile melts my heart.                                                                                              “Luke, Ryan get everyone together in whatever room is big enough. I would like to speak to everyone” I order and the pair disappear as soon as I’ve finished and start spreading the word                            “ family…….”Lucy mutters under her breath and I look at her puzzled                                                                                                             “ I remember where I saw your name” she cries almost startled by the memory but her face tells me it’s not a nice memory. Her normally golden tanned skin is a pasty white and her smile is a ghost of its former self                                                                                      “your family…there was a list…..” she starts fading in and out of reality.                                                                                                                  “Lucy relax” I sooth resting my hands on her shoulders comfortingly.                                                                                                         “There was a list with pictures, I didn’t realise who they were but they said they are top priority and all had the last name Umbrian. Two were crossed off but there was two that weren’t. One had missing written next to it and I think that was you.                         “And the other one?” I ask my heart in my throat                                       “the last one said wrong race” she says sounding as confused as me.
“Do you have any idea what that means?” I ask and she shakes her head hanging it in shame                                                                            “I do” Anne says behind us and looking back at her I find her sat there almost itching to tell us                                                      “I’m sure the others told you that it’s said an Umbrian is to bring the lycans out of hiding but like all tales it’s been altered and miss heard and the hunters have a different belief. The hunters believe that the Umbrian is going to start a war, a war between humans and lycans,  a war that humanity with all its weapons and technology would lose” she says sadly and the penny drops                                                                                        “ so the other Umbrian is a werewolf” I say and she just nods                     “ did the list say where the other Umbrian is?” I ask Lucy and she shakes her head.                                                                                        “I just saw the names and pictures, I’m sorry” she says and I smile gently.                                                                                                      “Don’t be. Thanks to you I know I have a brother or sister out there somewhere.” I say and the thought send a wave of hope though my spine.                                                                                                  “Jason. They are ready” Luke says quickly poking his head through the door way and with a deep breath I rise and head out to speak to the people who now look to me for leadership.                              Everyone has gathered out in the courtyard and for the first time I can see exactly how many people there is here. A rough head count gives between thirty and forty men, woman and a handful of children stood there waiting. All murmuring stops as I walk out and all eyes watch me curious as to why I have done this. They part as I walk into the crowd and whisper alpha under their breath and I continue till I’m in the centre and stop. Those closest back away leaving me in a clear circle and for a moment I freeze afraid but the lycan alpha instinct kicks in and the words start to pour out                                                                                     “ I’m sure most of you heard that today I sent three lycans packing for attacking a werewolf but let me make it clear. That werewolf is responsible for me getting here in one piece and I promises her a home. I keep my promises. We are all family here and I will NOT take any excuses for violence against family. No second chances you are gone! BUT if anyone from the outside tries to hurt anyone in MY family they will suffer worse.” I cry and fall silent and wait for a moment for the crowd to respond and for a moment no one says a word and a man only a few years older than me pushes through his brown hair a mess and his clothes covered in mud his hands shaking and for a moment he hesitates before stammering                                                “ What about the werewolves that came before telling us to leave?”                                                                                                                 “What werewolves?” I ask softly hoping not to frighten the already petrified man.                                                                                        “ a pack of werewolves came and said that they would come back in seven days from that night and that we must be gone by then” he says and although I feel no anger at the man my voice is half human half growl                                                                     “ where did they go?” I ask forcefully                                                       “we didn’t see but that was six days ago” he stammers obviously intimidated and I see the same fear in the rest of the packs eyes.                                                                                                          “Do you want to leave?” I ask him and he looks at me shocked                       “do you want to leave your home?” I ask again plainly                               “No but…..” he starts but with a raise of my hand he stops                            “Does anyone want to leave their home? Raise your hand if you do” I shout and all hands stay down                                                          “but we can’t hope to stop them from throwing us out.” The shaky man protests and I waves for him to continue                                  “they can fight of wolves, we can’t.” He starts and I straight away jump in like a small child                                                                        “and why can you?” I ask genuinely curious                                                      “because we haven’t got a…..” he starts and then stops as I raise an eyebrow and he smiles realising what I right in front of him                                                                                                                         “ I’ve just got here I’m not going to lose my home that quickly. Now who wants to stand up for their home?” I ask passionately and soon everyone is cheering and laughing and shouting my name but I don’t let it get to my head. It’s one thing to say you will be ready to fight another to actually fight                                             “we need to prepare. I want anyone unable to fight to go to the basement and wait. Anyone else I want you to go get ready. I will try and resolve this without conflict but if it ends up that way then I want you ready” I shout and the crowd disappear is hushed whisper of excitement                                                                              “are you sure about this Jason. You’ve barely changed let alone lead a pack in battle?” Ryan asks sceptical                                                          “I don’t think it’s going to come to that I reply and has puzzled                    “I’ve been thinking, when I went home I meet a couple of werewolves and they were determined that was their territory and since then each town out in this direction has been taken so I think…..” I start explaining but Luke beats me to the punch                             “that it’s the same werewolves” he says and I nod                                             “and how does that help us?” Ryan asks lost                                                            “one of those werewolves was my best friend as a human. I’ll admit we didn’t part on good terms but if he truly was my friend it may not come to fighting” I say hopeful                                                “and if tis not him? Or if he’s not the friend you thought he was” Ryan asks                                                                                                    “then he better pray I’m in a good mood” I growl and wave away his buts leaving to get changed. I’m not going to fight in ripped clothes and covered in dirt. I start to walk away then stop in my tracks turning to face the pair and chuckle                                        “is there any spare clothes?” I ask and the pair burst into fits of laughter and join me inside                                                                                  
Inside the house is a hive of activity as everyone prepares, men and woman getting ready to fight and only then do I realise that there is no weapon of any kind                                                                          “you don’t use any weapons? No guns or knives or anything?” I ask and Luke shakes his head                                                                            “only three things can pierce a lycans skin, another lycan, a werewolf or silver and the same applies to them. If this goes south it will be sheer paw to paw scraping” Luke says as we continue walking and I wonder if maybe I’ve made the wrong call. I feel so split in my mind but this is no time to worry about myself. I’ve made my decision and will stand by it                                                         “it’s not much but it’s yours” Ryan says standing back to let me enter first. The room is small the walls with a fresh paint of cream paint. A light wooden bed, chest of drawers and a small circular mirror are the only furnishings.                                                                                              “We went around camp earlier and got any clothes we could find. We can get some of your own later.” Ryan says and I’m stunned that people will be willing to let go of their belongings for me. From what I’ve seen they don’t have a lot” 
“Thank you.” I say simply and the pair turn to leave to get ready themselves.                                                                                                “One last thing, I would recommend wrapping your hands. Any protection is a good idea” Luke says smiling reassuringly before shutting the door and leaving me alone.                                                            Opening the draws I find them stiffed with clothes of all styles and colours and I’m overwhelmed by the kindness of people that I have known for only a few hours. Digging I find a pair of light grey joggers, a plain black t-shirt and light blue hoodie. Looking at the tattered clothes on the floor I wonder about what Luke said and set to work tearing long strips of cloth and wrap them around my hands and wrists tucking the leftovers into the wrap and stay sat there for a moment staring at the blank wall in front of me and Its strange, I’ve lost everything I had yet I feel like I’ve just come home.                                                                           Looking in the mirror I see someone else looking back, my hair shorter than it’s ever been and darker than before but is my eyes that have changed most, harder, stronger the brown has a slight red tinge to it. My train of thought is stopped by a collection of knocks on the door                                                                                           “come in” I shout and as the door opens the figure of Lucy appears. The bruise on her face hidden slightly and the bandages evident under her clothes                                                                “the others told me what’s going on.” She says worried                                        “you don’t need to worry. It’s going to be fine” I reply hopefully sounding more confident than I feel                                                                  “ I think I should be with you” she says and before I can protest she shushes me with a finger                                                                                  “werewolves are just as loyal as lycans are. If they find me hidden they might think I was kidnapped or something. Maybe having a werewolf at your side can help she says and as much as I hate to admit it she’s right                                                                        “but your hurt. If they attack…..” I start drifting off holding her hands in mine and loss myself in her eyes and I feel my heart leave me at become hers                                                                              “then I will tell them that you saved me, risked your life for mine” she says firmly and I know trying to argue with her will be pointless.                                                                                                  “This will all work out fine you’ll see” 
Night falls and with its blanket of darkness comes an eerie silence as we wait. I stand with only Lucy and Luke beside me. The others wait to the side as we wait. The light breeze numbs my face and sends chills down my spine. Lights glow around us making patches of light on the black ground and then I hear them, their footsteps light almost undetectable and I hear mummers in the group, incoherent whispers of excitement, fear and unease. No lycan makes a sound as they pass light in the dim lights, men and woman dressed in all sorts of styles but all their eyes fixed on the three of us. A few growl at the others but they don’t respond. I don’t get a good look at the leader of the group till he is stood right in front of me. Three of them splitting off from the main group to meet us on equal terms. The first I see is new a girl with long black hair and a pair of glistening green eyes but the other two I know. One an old man with grey hair and a grey beard and the other with a long mop of long brown hair and pale blue eyes.                                                             “Jason?” he says stunned to see me and I smirk                                                 “the one and only” I reply and mummers of confusion fill the air but with a hand all lycans stop and Connor looks at me almost afraid.                                                                                                        “Only an Umbrian could have lycans that disciplined” he says and I don’t says a word letting the realisation do the talking and I see a flicker of unease creep into his face.                                                        “That may be but the threat still stands, leave or we will….” The old man starts gruffly but I don’t let him finish                                            “No. you will not threaten us in our own home.” I growl and I see him ball his fists weighing me up trying to stare me down but failing and that stops him                                                                        “why do you want this is the first place?” Luke asks and the three remain silent.                                                                                        “Why?” I ask forcefully and I get my answer                                                  “because the hunters took our home. We have no territory” he says and the honesty calms the air                                                                    “ all of this is pointless, are you going to leave or is it a fight?” the old man shouts angry and looking around me at both the werewolves and lycans I see everyone willing to fight, to die and I can’t let that happen.                                                                                 “I have a proposal. There is no need for everyone here to fight, to die.” I start and the old man buts in
“And what is this proposal?” the old man sneers                                                “I challenge the alpha of your pack to the rights of leadership” I shout and the air fills with the gasps of two races                                              “Jason! What are you doing?” Lucy cries but I don’t reply keeping my gaze on the man in front of me                                                       “a lycan can’t lead a werewolf pack, we don’t……”                                    “You don’t what… you seem to be dictating everything so I see no reason why not?” I reply and a deep growl is the only response I get                                                                                                       “I want it to be three, three werewolves, three lycans. Last race standing wins” he growls and I look to Luke who nods ready to fight.                                                                                                               “Who else would be willing to stand by my side to fight?” I shout and every lycan hands raises in the darkness.                                         “Alpha I didn’t give you the warmest welcome, let me give the same to them” a voice calls and emerging is the chubby but swift man from my arrival and I nod.                                                                  “I have my three, where is yours?” I reply confident but all that is shattered when Connor steps up to the plate and pushing his way through the crowd is a muscular man standing over me with thick black hair and razor sharp hazel eyes. No one moves for a moment as if waiting for a sign, a signal and as I stand there inhaling through my nose I catch a scent that sets my stomach churning. Silver                                                                                      “wait” I shout as the three werewolves charge and they look at me confused and hopeful                                                                                     “can’t you smell that?” I ask hoping someone will be able to confirm my suspicions                                                                                     “ smell what?” the old man laughs obviously thinking that I’ve gotten cold feet                                                                                                  “ silver” I sneer and as the word leaves my mouth the world erupts in chaos. Volleys of bullets hit everything around me wood, cement, lycan and werewolf alike are caught in the fire many falling injured. I throw myself over Lucy protecting her with my own body and I feel a bullet nestle itself in the back of my thigh burning like a hot coal held to my skin. As the volley dies out I slowly rise groaning softly from the pain in my leg and as I try to take a step I find my leg weak and unable to hold my weight. Looking ahead of me I find the old man and Connor tending to those hurt.                                                                                          “Help anyone inside that’s hurt” I shout and find that over half of my pack has been hit and leave tending wounds to arms, legs and bodies.                                                                                                          “ get your injured inside too” I shout meeting eyes with the old man and he hesitates                                                                                           “ DO IT” I shout and he looks at me stunned but not by my tone but by my offer                                                                                         “ you heard him get the wounded inside” he shouts and they hobble past me inside and left outside is thirty of us, a mix of werewolves and lycans                                                                                        “ that’s the first wave, they want to frighten you more than anything, now they will march in to cut you down” Lucy says and I realise we need to act fast.                                                                      “We need to work together to stop this” I say to the old man and he nods                                                                                                        “what do you have in mind Umbrian?” he asks and the use of my last name as a title falls strangely on my ear.                                                 “We need to isolate them, split their group up and overwhelm them.” I say and as I look around me and look at the lights I form a plan.                                                                                                        “Can you see in the dark?” I ask and he scoffs                                                    “of course we can. Why would you ask?” he says not clicking on                                                                                                                       “ smash the lights, all of them now” I shout and everyone sets to work smashing any bulbs,  blowing out any candles and soon we are plunged into complete darkness but we’re running out of time. I can hear their footsteps coming, in step and soft trying to stay undetected                                                                                    “split up, move fast and light and watch each other’s backs. We might be two different races but to them we are one problem. We fight together” I say loud enough for everyone to hear but so the hunters don’t and we scatter, rather they scatter I limp my leg numb and a dead weight. I’ve barely moved when the hunters arrive. Dressed in dull grey uniforms with guns in their hands and knifes at their side. I hear nothing but their movement and breathing as they split around the courtyard and play straight into our hands. I can see the werewolves slip around getting right next to them without being seen only heard rattling the hunters, sending them spinning aimlessly and breathing faster and faster, serving only as a signal to us that they are ready for us to close in. in a wave of black we charge into the groups only seen when it’s too late. Screams and gun shots fill the air. As I change to join the fight the bullet in my leg buries itself deeper and I let out a roar of pain and everything falls silent as all eyes fall on me. My red eyes no doubt stark against the black. The world is fully visible in black and white and I waste no time charging into the nearest group that are slowly backing away, werewolves circling waiting for an opening. I leap over one werewolf and hit the group like a bowling ball hitting down the pins and set to work cutting into hunters left right and centre, the werewolves close in finishing off any scraps and within seconds the groups seven lay on the floor still and bleeding out, their blood forming into one great pool. I turn looking for a new target but find a group on the back foot. A group of hunter wearing what must be night vison are cutting their way towards the building not caring if attackers are finished only intent on reaching the house, growling softly to the wolves I nod my head at the group and they join my side happy to follow my lead, I run across the ground on all four, silent as death as I leap through the air pouncing on the hunter in the rear and grab him to the floor bashing his head into the floor and I hear his skull crumble.                         The group aware of my presence spin round ready to shoot but I’ve already moved and they have just turned their backs onto a pack of hungry wolves, everywhere I look I see the same tactic used and the same result. Dead hunters. Soon none are left standing and for a moment I stand there not expecting it to finish that easy breathing deeply gritting my teeth against the pain in my leg and listen as one by one lycans and werewolves begin to howl together the high and low notes twisting together in perfect natural harmony and I can’t help but join in and in my howl I find every emotion I’ve bottled up inside leave, sadness, fear, joy, every feeling found in one long note and as we change back one by one, werewolves and lycans side by side I feel a sense of pride as we are victorious and we set aside our petty quarrels for the greater good but I can’t shake the feeling that this is only a skirmish in a great war and we just gave away our position.














PAINFUL PAST

Hobbling around I check on those around me crossing my fingers that none of ours have been harmed. My prayers are not answered. Five lycans and seven wolves lay on the floor their bodies stiff, their eyes blank. I’m lost for what to do next. I don’t know who’s died and how to act so I do the only thing I can. I hobble around closing their eyes. Werewolf and lycan alike. As I rise from closing the eyes of a fallen lycan I find Luke stood there his clothes in tatters and blood coats his arms. None of it is his.                                                                                               “Your hurt” he says as I hobble towards him my teeth grinding together.                                                                                                               “It’s fine. I must sort all this out first then I’ll get it fixed” I reply gesturing at the mess around me.                                                            “It’s obviously not fine, go and get yourself looked at. Ill handle this. I know what to do” he says sternly and I head his counsel.                                                                                                    “Fine but if anything happens find me straight away don’t go alone” I order as I walk away                                                                            “of course”                                                                                                                                                                                 
As I limp inside I find something I had never expected, the lycans now on the mend faster are helping the werewolves, laughing together, supporting each other and as I limp past them they nod and smile, each step is agony but I don’t let it show. I don’t know why I won’t but my body refuses to budge as I make my way around trying to find Anne, the only one that knows how to get the bullet out but I’m stopped by a very angry Lucy who looks torn as to slap me or hug me.  Thankfully she chooses the latter.                                                                                                    “I could hear all the noise outside, I thought that maybe…..” she starts breaking into at the end. Holding her closer to my chest I whisper into her ear                                                                                “I’m never going to go anywhere. I will always come back”                           a light awkward cough behind us breaks the reunion and turning gingerly around I find the old and Connor stood there together, their clothes stretched  their trousers with huge holes in the legs and tops stretched to almost twice the size                                     “ thank you, we came here threatening to take your home but instead you made it open to us” he says his voice full of gratitude and respect.                                                                                         “We don’t need to enemies. The hunters are the enemy” I reply and he nods in agreement.                                                                                   “You’re hurt” Connor says pointing at my wounded leg and a smirk                                                                                                               “it’s just a scratch. It’s nothing to get worried about” I reply but he shakes his head.                                                                                 “No it’s not. Its silver, if too much gets into your system…..” he says wavering off and I catch his drift. Lucy’s grip on the arm tightens in fear                                                                              “sit down. I can get it out” the old man says and I’m hesitant to let him                                                                                                                 “if you don’t let me take it out it will only get worse, the others are far too busy to stop everything for you. Trust me, you saved our lives now let me save your” he pleads and gingerly I drop to the floor stretching out my legs.                                                                          The old man moves to inspect the wound, pocking and prodding making me wince in pain                                                                                      “you changed with the bullet inside didn’t you” he asks rhetorically and I don’t reply                                                                               “you’ve healed over the bullet, I’m going to have to cut through the skin to get to it. Connor find me a scalpel or something small and sharp” he says and Connor disappears leaving me with the old man and Lucy.                                                                                  “You took that bullet for me didn’t you?” she says almost ashamed as Connor returns with what a tiny knife                                           “I’m sorry but this was all I could find” he says looking at both the old man and I                                                                                              “it’ll do. I recommend biting down on something. This will hurt” he says and ripping of my top I fold it roughly in to a ball, the touch of Lucy’s cold hand sends shivers through me and as I bit down on the torn clothes tasting of dirt, sweat and blood I brace myself as well as I can. Connor grabs hold of my hand and I feel the knife press against my skin but it doesn’t cut through it presses into it making a deep mark but my skin doesn’t break.                                                                                                   “That’s not good. The Umbrian blood is running thick now, I can’t pierce your skin like this” he says and something Luke says runs through my head                                                                                     “only a lycan, and werewolf or silver can break our skin”                                        I pull the fabric from my mouth and know what has to be done.               “ change and use your claws” I say and his face drops in surprise                                                                                                           “ your realise that is very risky don’t you, I could do a lot of damage” he says almost afraid of doing it                                                        “ this bullet will do more damage if you don’t” I reply and he nods                                                                                                                   “ ill open up the area around it and you’ll have to get the bullet out Connor” he says and Connor nods ready . The old man changes there and then and stands there as big as a cow and built like an ox, his fur a sleek black and his eyes a vivid purple. I promptly put the fabric back into my mouth and brace myself as well as I can before giving him the nod.                                          
Pain fills my brains his claws cut into my skin in five separate places, my sight fills with red and black. The cloth muffles my screams .I almost lose consciousness as I feel Connor search more the bullet pushing skin and muscle out the way. Vomit rises up my throat till I hear a sigh of relief and I feel myself healing almost instantly and the pain subsides dramatically. My sight slowly return to normality and I find the floor around my leg covered in my own blood but my leg is perfectly fine, no scars, no nothing.                                                                                            “Well that wasn’t fun” I laugh pulling the fabric out of my mouth and the others chuckle though the Old mans is more a wolven pant. The old man walks off disappearing as quickly as he appeared leaving Connor to pull me to my feet.                                              “I’m sure it wasn’t” he says smiling and for a moment it feel like nothing’s changed.                                                                                          “I’m going to go and see if anyone needs some help.” Lucy says walking away briskly leaving the two of us alone.                                         “Your girlfriend seems nice” he laughs nudging me playfully in the shoulder                                                                                                          “she’s not my girlfriend. I’ve only known her for just over a day” I argue blushing sounding like a small child.                                        “You saved a lot of lives today. First stopping all-out war between our packs and then letting our hurt inside.”                        He says sounding in awe of my actions                                     “I only done what was best for the pack. I don’t want anyone hurt, not when I can prevent it” I say honestly and he smiles                           “you say that like a true alpha. I can see how you rose to the top so quickly” he says sounding more proud than jealous                                 “I didn’t try to be alpha. It just happened.” I tell him honestly recalling the whirlwind of events.                                                                    “I never would have thought you was an Umbrian.” He says honestly                                                                                                             “its mad how things play out sometimes isn’t it? Did you know my parents weren’t my parents at all?” I ask and he nods                                 “you had different smells, they smelt fake, manmade but you smelt different. A strong odour, an earthy, gritty smell. I thought maybe you was adopted and didn’t know” he says and an awkward silence falls between us                                                          “so what’s your alphas name? He seems nice” I ask and he chuckles.                                                                                                           “He doesn’t say, he’s just alpha. It’s what we have always called him” he says                                                                                                         “well that’s going to get very confusing isn’t it” I laugh and he joins in.                                                                                                              “We will have to think of a new name for you” he jokes                                   “I think just using my actual name would be okay.” I say and he shakes his head.                                                                                           “Too informal. And I’m sure there is bound to be another Jason at some stage.” He says and gets to work trying to think of a new title                                                                                                            “why did your alpha call me by my last name anyway?” I ask him trying to change the topic                                                                       “I don’t know probably some old fashioned rule” he says and I see an idea pop into his head.                                                                        “Umbra. That’s what we can call you.” he says and I laugh                              “do you really think that would catch on?” I laugh and he nods seriously                                                                                                          “I think it will. If it’s heard enough. That’s what I’m going to call you from now on” he says seriously.                                                          “Jason!” Luke shouts running across the room shoving anyone in his way                                                                                                            “there’s a problem, you need to come quickly” he says and disappears as quickly as he arrived. I give Connor a look of farewell and dart after the flustered Luke. We run back outside and in the distance is a faint glow lighting up both alpha and Ryan who stand over something obscuring anyone’s view                               “go away” alpha growls as we approach not looking                                        “no.” I reply simply and he turns around grimacing                                          “sorry I thought it was someone else” he says sheepishly and moves over so I can see what they are trying to hide. It’s not something but rather someone. Someone that I never imagined I would see.                                                                                                        “Jason?” he says his face stained with blood as it runs down his face from a wound hidden by his hair.                                                        “You know this hunter?” alpha asks stunned by the revelation and almost accusing me of consorting with the enemy                                      “I wouldn’t say that. He’s one of the hunters that took me” I reply and alphas rage turns from me to him. At first I thought that when I found them again all I wold want to go is hurt them but as I stand here looking at him lying there part of me feels almost sympathetic                                                                                           “we didn’t take him! We was just charged with raising him.” he protests looking at me with what feels like real love in his eyes                       “it’s true we were not your real parents but we loved you like a real son. The hunters wanted to take you away so we ran to keep you safe.” He pleads and in my head a war rages as to believe him or not.                                                                                            “Don’t tell me you are listening to this!?  He and his friends just tried to kill us all and did kill some of us including you” Ryan protests angrily growling loudly at the hostage                                       “I can help you. I know their plans, their….” He starts pleading as he sees his affiliation with me won’t change anyone’s mind.                                                                                                            “I can tell you where your half-brother is” he says and everything stops.                                                                                                                   “Where?” I growl disgusted at the fact his love was just a ploy                        “a werewolf pack back home. They sent him there to prevent him becoming a lycan.” He says oblivious to the fact they are here.                                                                                                                  “You mean the pack that arrived here today? The one whose home you just destroyed?” I laugh and his eyes go wide in disbelief                                                                                                                “I can…..” he murmurs all his bargaining chips played and lost.                                                                                                                    “No. you will tell us your plans or I’m going to make your life hell. You see us as monsters right? How would you like to be one?” I whisper, his very soul freezing form the cold of my voice.                                                                                                              “Let’s start with how you found us” I say and he hesitates but the growls from alpha and Luke are enough to hurry him up                           “the benefits you claim, the services you use, bank cards, credit cards. Anywhere that’s suspicious we cheek” he says looking down at the floor ashamed to tell us.                                                    “Why did you attack us, a group as small as yours had little chance?” alpha asks and he refuses to say a word.                                            “Answer the question!” I shout getting right into his face                                “we wasn’t here for a slaughter. We were here for you. The new leader is very interested in you.” he says and eyebrows raise across the board.                                                                                                     “The hunters have a new leader?” alpha enquires and get his answer without any prompts                                                                              “yes. He has pulled back all searches for packs and is using every available resource to find Jason” he says his eyes fixed on me.                                                                                                                       “Don’t call me that. The name you gave me is not who I am anymore” I growl all the love I once felt for the man gone with the wind.                                                                                                          “It doesn’t matter what I call you or what you do, we will find you and we will take you to him.” he laughs at my defiance and his love is shown for the façade it was                                          “where is he?” I growl but he only laughs louder                                      “do you really think that I would know that? We ae told nothing. We are only the pawns, the soldiers.”                                                     “Then no one will miss you when you are gone” I sneer as I feel myself start to change.                                                                                “You won’t kill me Jason, what would mum think and David and Lauren? Can you really do that to them.” he says and for a moment I stop and he smiles smugly.                                                          “No Jason wouldn’t, but Jason doesn’t exist anymore.” I say blankly                                                                                                              “then who are you?” he asks slowly not happy where this is going.                                                                                                              I lean in close to his ear as I change and feel my teeth lengthen and fur start to grow and growl gently sending shivers down his body and say                                                                                                         “ I am umbra, I am the end of the hunters” and as he pleads and begs I wrap my fangs around his neck and slowly start to sink them in, ribbons of blood running down my fangs staining my tongue with the bitter taste and I freeze my mind flashing through the memories we have together. Every birthday every Christmas and slowly I let go, my mind my own once more and as realisation of what I’ve done sets my hearts racing and my limbs shaking. I look at him lying there four circles of blood in his neck and spin around looking at the carnage around me my head goes into meltdown as I realise what I’ve done. I was drunk with a strength the likes of which I have never felt before. My breathing is fast and shallow as I look at my hands to find them sticky with blood.                                                                         “what do you want us to do with him umbra?” alpha asks and I’m confused                                                                                                            “ Jason!” he shouts and I spin around frightened and see him stood there a concerned look on his face                                                            “ what shall we do with him?” he asks looking to me for answers and I feel myself slipping again                                                             “ make him the monster he want to kill. Scratch him alpha” I order the strength taking control one more                                                    “but…..that……” he stammers then realises my plan                                      “no...No please don’t. No Please!” he squeals as alpha changes and walks towards him and as his screams fill the air a sick smile crosses my face.                                                                                         “Go back to your leader and tell him what you want but don’t forget to give him my message. This is an act of war, you have brought the fight to our door. Now I am going to bring it to yours” I growl but he doesn’t move laying there sobbing                                   “GO!” I shout and he leaps to his feet flinging himself to the floor before scampering away drops of blood hitting the floor leaving a trail of red.                                                                                      “Are you okay Jason?” Luke asks worried                                                             “I…I don’t know…..I…” I stammer so confused. My actions from my body but not my mind.                                                                     “Go and rest. I’ll explain later. Il handle this.” Luke says firmly                       “no I’m the alpha I should….” I start but he refuses to listen                         “and you’ve also only been a lycan for a few days. Let me handle it. I know what I’m doing.  I’ll find you when I’m done and we can talk” he says firmly and I can’t argue with him.                        “Promise me you will find me if anything else happens” I demand and he nods                                                                                             “oh course.”                                                                                                            As I slowly make my way in I have to dodge bodies and tread around pools of blood and bile fills my throat, the smell enough alone to set me gagging. Everywhere I look I find family and friends holding each other in comfort and sadness and I feel guilty. He said that they want me so if I hadn’t been here then no one wold have died.                                                                                      I don’t say a word to anyone as I walk around the house in a daze but somehow finding myself one of the many bathrooms and stand there staring into the mirror. My face and hands covered in blood and as I wash it off tears begin to roll a steady stream of sadness and pain mixing with the red of rage and hatred. I lost control. I went wild and killed. I want me. I wasn’t human I was an animal. I look at my reflection disgusted and smash a fist into it smashing it into pieces. The tinkle of falling glass a welcome distraction from the world and I feel my fist throb from the impact but my skin stays strong.                       “Your dad smashed the exact same mirror when he first arrived here” the familiar voice of Anne comments not angry just reminiscent.                                                                                                            “I lost control Anne with Leon and now with this…I…I killed people” I stammer the words making my throat hurt                               “why? Why did you kill those people?” she asks                                              “Leon because it was the only way to help you and the hunters because they attacked us” I reply simply                                                           “is it wrong to protect your family? Is it wrong to keep those you care about safe?”                                                                                   “But I wasn’t me! I felt different” I shout before falling silent again.                                                                                                                  “It was you! A lycan isn’t half wolf half man. Its different shell with the same filling. A lycans wolf is only as evil as the person behind it. You were in control Jason you just let go of that man’s throat!” she shouts and what she says makes sense.                                                                                                 “It’s not just that Anne. They said it’s me that they wanted. If I hadn’t been here……”                                                                                               “Then Leon would have still been alpha and we would all be dead” she says bluntly and I look at her stunned                                                “this is not your fault. Those that died would have died if you was here or not. Those out there alive, they are your fault. In the space of a day as alpha you have made peace between two packs and fended of a hunter attack. You are not a monster. You are an alpha and a darn good one so far” she declares and I feel a weight lifting from my soul. I still feel guilty about killing and I’m sure I will till the day that I die but remembering why helps.                                                                             “Go and get some rest Jason. Everything’s under control.” She says her voice full of concern before disappearing as quickly as she had appeared.                                                                                              As I make my way towards my room I’m greeted by countless werewolves and lycans sat in the hallways talking, laughing and I see all division forgotten in an instant. Many just tip there head in greeting and some call me by name but not the name I was given at birth. The name I called myself, the name that I laughed would never catch on but it has, spreading like wildfire and as I hear it more and more it feels less and less strange.                             “Umbra”.                                                                                                         Walking into my room I find Lucy sat on my bed looking blankly at the wall so deep in thought that she doesn’t hear me enter.                                                                                                                “Are you okay?” I ask although I can tell somethings wrong.                      “Oh I’m fine just a bit frazzled.” She says not looking at me                           “it’s okay Lucy. It’s over” I say rubbing her shoulder trying to calm her down.                                                                                                 “It’s not though is it? They know where we are now. They will come back.” she says and I want tell her they won’t, that we can live in peace now but I don’t want to lie to her.                                              “They might but we are ready. We…..”                                                          “We can fight every night? We can lose friends every day? You might be able to but I can’t! I can’t spend every day sitting here worried about you” she shouts before snapping silent her cheeks turning a bright red.                                                                                       “We won’t. No one else is going to die. I say as I lift her chin gently so we are looking into each other’s eyes                                               “ we will be free, we will live in peace” I say delicately brushing tears from under her eyes.                                                                “how can you promise that?” she asks                                                             “because till the last breath leaves my lungs I will not rest till we do” I say softly and she smiles hugging me softly forcing the pair of us to fall softly, laying together on top of the quilt                          “I’ll hold you to that promise Jason” she yawns and I smile                          “I know you will.” 
Waking in the morning I find myself alone once more and as I sit up stretching I long for her company again. Sitting there I feel cold and realise I’m still in the tattered clothes of last night. Routing through the draws I try to find something to wear and settle for a plain black and white combo with some faded jeans. I can find no shoes so I settle for some socks.                                               The hallways that where full last night are now bare only discarded bandages and spots of blood are the only evidence of the crowd last night.                                                                                 I come towards the closed doors to the courtyard and hesitate with my hand on the handle, take a deep breath and push the door open to find the floor bare, all the bodies gone and not a spec of blood or bullets on the ground, all that’s left is the holes. Tiny circular holes turning everything into Swiss cheese.                        Droves of people sweep the floor gathering anything previously missed or start to take down anything broken.                                             “How on earth did you do all this?” I ask Luke once he’s delegated instructions                                                                                       “I didn’t. I came out this morning and all the hunter bodies had gone. The werewolf and lycan bodies and their families have gone to the crematorium” He says saddened by the losses but also confused.                                                                                                  “Are you sure that’s a good idea?” I ask                                                            “we have friends there and they won’t ask questions. We have covered our tracks for centuries Jason.” He says confidently                                                                                                “what about the hunters? “                                                                               “The hunters have never attacked in public before. Its safe Jason don’t panic” he says reassuringly                                                                                                    “Do you think the hunters gathered them?” I ask curious referring to the dead bodies                                                     “maybe though they haven’t bothered before. I’m not going to complain but it’s strange, all of it, they aren’t stupid they would have known we would overwhelm them at that time. It was suicide to move in then” he says oohing and ahing and while it puzzles me too there is more important things to worry about                          “is everyone okay? There was nothing else?” I ask hoping my withdrawal had made me miss anything                                                           “no everyone’s fine and on the mend, most of us are healed already but the were’s take longer” he says just stating a fact rather than taking a dig.                                                               “I think there alpha was looking for you earlier, didn’t say why just asked me to tell you to find him when you can” he adds and I smile.                                                                                                              “Thank you Luke. For everything” I tell him and leave him to manage the clean up outside.                                                                 Back inside they’ve started cleaning up with everyone able and some that shouldn’t be scrubbing the floor or bagging bandages most ignore me as I walk past deep in conversation and the air is full of laughing and small talk. I find alpha sat there talking to Connor the pair of them talking fast and loud but among the crowd there conversation is garble till I get closer I shouldn’t really eavesdrop but my curiosity gets the better of me                                    “ he practically saved our lives” Connor replies to something I missed  obviously angry                                                                                     “ and I’m grateful for that but its better he doesn’t know” alpha says and it doesn’t take a genius to work out who “he” is                               “ why? Why not tell him? He deserves to know” Connor cries outraged and stepping out the shadows I ask simply                                “deserves to know what?” with my arms folded looking at the pair expectantly and they exchange worried glances.                                      “Come on tell me I haven’t got all day” I say frustrated hating secrets.                                                                                                              “It’s….” Connor starts but a cold look from alpha stops him                               “I cannot have people around me I cannot trust. Tell me what’s going on” I order growing more frustrated by the second.                        “It’s your brother, half-brother” alpha says and my heart starts to race at the mention of the last blood family I have.                                                           “What about him? Do you know who it is? Is he here?” I ask excited.                                                                                                               “ we know who it is but he isn’t here” he says and I can see he’s reluctant to tell me where he is but seeing I won’t let it lie he groans                                                                                                            “ he and a few others stayed behind when the hunters took our home, fought them so we had time to escape we haven’t heard from any of them since” he says sadly and taking a deep breath to stop my hands from shaking I comprehend the news.                         “There is a chance he got away” Connor says trying to help but failing.                                                                                                                I walk away without saying a word as my emotions run wild, anger, sadness, pity, back to anger again. I can’t leave to find him. The pack is my first priority and the hunters could return any time. Every time I get close to finding someone they slip away.                                                                                                               “Umbra” Connor shouts the name that seems to slowly taking over and I stop turning to face him.                                                                   “Your brother is my closest friend and not a day goes by that I regret leaving him behind but he is just as strong willed as you. If anyone escaped he would have. Don’t lose hope” he says before leaving once more and I wish I hadn’t listened but Connors right I can’t lose hope. There’s a chance he’s okay and as long as there’s a chance there’s hope.                                                       I turn my attention to what Luke was saying about the hunters. Why march in then, why not wait till we had fought and tired ourselves? Why were they so intent on reaching the house? It was almost like they were looking for something in there                  we wasn’t looking for a slaughter. We were looking for you.                     As I stand there it all becomes clear. All the pieces slot into place. I run back through the crowd back to where alpha and Connor sit panting and the pair look at me stunned                                            “I know what they were doing. Meet me in my room in ten minutes” I pant and disappear again to find Luke and Ryan.                               It takes an age to find them both, eventually finding them with a pair of werewolves sharing a bottle of what smells like whiskey and laughing.                                                                                      “Ryan. Luke” I shout and the pair look at me on the verge of being tipsy and smile                                                                                    “my room now” I order and the pair realise instantly somethings wrong and bid farewell to the pair in front of them and join my side without a word until we reach my room where alpha and Connor are waiting                                                                                         “Okay Jason what’s going on?” Luke asks confused                                           “I think I’ve worked out what the hunters were doing here last night” I say and no one says a word                                                                    “the survivor said they have ditched everything in an attempt to find me. I thin last night they had an idea I was here so they moved in bringing him with them certain that I wouldn’t kill him.” I say and heads nod across the board                                                  “so now they know you are here why haven’t they moved in with force?” Ryan asks                                                                                       “I don’t know I think they are waiting for something.  I think that we will find out what soon” I tell them and silence falls as the same thought goes through our mind. Can we hold them off again?                                                                                                              “So what do we do know?” Connor asks eager to do something                         “there isn’t much we can do but wait now” I tell him and I can see he hates the idea.                                                                                        “ so we just have to sit here and twiddle our thumbs while they move on their plans?” he spits answering his own question before storming out the room outraged quickly followed by alpha who looks at me apologetically as he leaves.                                               “That’s not everything is it Jason?” Luke says before I do a thing.                                                                                                                    “It’s too much of a coincidence that the hunter arrive at the exact time the werewolves do.” I say speaking my mind, trusting the pair.                                                                                                   “You think they are setting us up?” Ryan asks stunned at the suggestion.                                                                                                               “Not all of them or maybe not any of them. I could be wrong but….I don’t know something just doesn’t feel right.” I says not able to explain hoping they will understand.                                                       “What do you want us to do?” Luke says proudly ready to do anything I ask.                                                                                                        “For now nothing. While we have no proof I will not risk destroying what we have. There is too much on our plate without splitting everyone.” I say and they nod                                                     “smart. I’ll keep an eye out for anything strange” Ryan says before excusing himself.                                                                                        “That’s not what’s bothering you either” Luke says smiling lightly and I can’t help but smile back.                                                                        “No it’s not but this more personal than pack related” I say and in a moment all protocol of alpha to beta vanishes and it’s just two friends and Luke plops himself on my bed eager to listen.                        “It’s my brother” I say and his chin touches the floor                                       “have they found him?” he asks almost more excited than me                          “no they lost him. They said that when the hunters attacked them my brother stayed behind to get the others time to escape” I tell him and I see him think wondering what the best thing to say is.                                                                                                               “There’s a chance they might have taken him captive but I can’t do anything because I belong here” I say sadly and he looks at me understandingly.                                                                                       “Now you are the one with something bothering them” I laugh at his expression                                                                                                  “I know werewolves are incredibly loyal so for them to leave others behind……..” he says before drifting off                                                “you think they are lying” I say my heart dropping.                                      “No werewolves don’t lie but I don’t think they are telling you everything” he says                                                                                                “I’m lost” I say holding my head in my hands                                                   “me too” he says and we both chuckle softly at the predicament like two school children that failed to study and now face the consequences.                                                                                                           “What can I do Luke? I don’t even know who I am anymore. How can I lead a pack” I say my faith gone.                                                      “You know who you are but you won’t accept it. You are the alpha that arrived and changed everything. You are the alpha that showed compaction to his enemies. You need to stop fighting who you are let it free. Trust yourself. These are not alpha instincts or lycan instincts they are your instincts your beliefs.” He says looking at me hard.                                              “But I…..” I start but a deafening bang stops me dead and as the smell of silver fills the air I don’t need to say a word as both Luke and I dart to the room and run to the front door to find my captor stood there smiling a light gun in one hand with two other hunters both men over six foot, one darkly tanned with a face like thunder the other as pale as the other is dark but just as disgusted as he looks at us.  As much as the three are a horrid sight another sight is worse.                                                                                   Laying in the middle of the triangle is a werewolf, still in its wolf form in still stands tall and proud even with the silver muzzle over its jaw and chains holding each pair of legs together turning the bare skin bright red. Dried blood coats the metal and the prisoner’s feet from burst sores.                                                More and more wolves and lycans arrive all of them standing behind me growling furiously but the trio don’t move, their faces stay a blank canvas.                                                                                      “ we haven’t come to fight, we came to talk” he says raising his hands but that doesn’t settle anyone’s nerves                                               “ you better talk fast because each second I look at you I draw closer to killing you myself” I growl my alpha instincts kicking in                                                                                                                  “ I don’t think you will Jason, you are really going to want to hear what I have to say” he says smirking confidently and I take a threatening step forward making the two hunters at the back raise their guns and point them at the wolf in front of them                           “ now Jason would you be so quick to kill your brother?” he says so calmly it takes me a minute to hear.                                                  “We came to propose a trade. Him for you” he says simply and my world freezes as we stand there and I met eyes with the wolf in front of me. His eyes the same deep blue and in his eyes I see everything I need to hear. He doesn’t know me yet he knows what I feel, what I’m going through. He is ready to go if it’s what I decide but I see the pain in his eyes and a wicked thought falls into my mind. As I watch Ryan, Connor and many more waiting outside. The hunters think they hold the cards but they have just walked into the wolves pit and they are hungry                                                                                                             “take off his chains and muzzle and I give you my word that I will come quietly."                                                                                             “That’s not enough. I want your word that no one in your pack will harm us till we have left” he says and looking at Luke who shakes his head in silent plea                                                                              “I give you my word. No one in my pack will harm you as we leave” I say and his smile widens as whitey bends down to take the shackles off the wolf while the others stays aimed till he was walked past them till he stands behind me. As he passes me I make my way towards them my head held high but I don’t walk alone. Every werewolf in the room moves with me growling and the three hunters look around confused as the doors fly open behind them and they are meet with a wall of hungry faces and snapping jaws                                                                                      “ you  gave us your word no one in your pack would harm us” he shrieks as the trio are closed together surrounded.                                     “And they won’t. Werewolves and lycans can’t be in the same pack. They are just guests and I believe they are here because of you” I say and sweat drenches his face shivering in fear his face quivers                                                                                                                “Jason…please…..” he pleads the trio pointing their guns at one werewolf before flicking to the next and the next.                                           “I’m not the one that can call them off and that isn’t my name. Anymore. I am umbra. I am the end of the hunters and the rise of the lycans “I say my voice steady and emotionless as the horde descends and the trio of hunters disappear.                                                 Looking over to where my brother stands gingerly his eyes looking around him his gaze full of uncertainty.                                         “Luke. Take him to my room and get him some clothes. I’ll be there in a moment” I order but as Luke begins to reach out to him to help him he backs away with his back raised. His eyes falling on my in a plea of help.                                                                    “I don’t think that’s going to work” Luke says backing away slowly and I step forward and as I reach out to scoop him up he doesn’t resist. My legs creek and arms ache as I rise and walk down the hall being as gentle as I can. No one follows disbanding without being told only Luke and a few others remain to clean up the mess.                                                                         I place him on my bed and start routing though my draws to find him clothes throwing them over my shoulder and wait tapping my foot as he dresses. My heart is racing at the thought of meeting my brother and with a gruff                                                    “I’m done” I turn around and find myself eye to eye with my brother. My real brother. He stands at the same height as me but while I have the physic of a runner he’s built more like a wrestler. His hair longer than mine could ever be, a perfect black and straight as an arrow. His mouth looks like it hasn’t smiled in months and his eyes are red, puffed up balls of flesh.                                                  
“You need to rest. Take my room.” I say starting to walk out the room the reality too much for me.                                                                    “No umbra you need to stay” he says and I’m not sure what to make of the demanding tone in his voice but curious I stop and turn around.                                                                                                     “You are being played just like I was. That old man calling himself alpha and Connor they are working with the hunters. They travel the county finding packs to join then tell the hunters and then begin the cycle again. The last pack they took was mine.” he says full of anger and betrayal                               “so why did they help fight the hunters that attacked?” I ask confused.                                                                                                              “That was a test. They are expendable. You are not. They thought I was drugged and I heard everything. Even today was a set up. They want you to think you are safe, that you are in control. They want to catch you. I don’t know why. They thought I was the one but my blood wasn’t right. Umbrian blood is supposed to be lycan. They want your blood umbra.” He says bluntly being honest with me                                                               “why me? I get I’m an Umbrian and stronger but why go through the trouble of trying to catch me? What would they gain?” I ask confused.                                                                                        “You are the only lycan able to hold onto control as a wolf, you and anyone you turn are stronger faster. Their skin impenetrable and self-healing. They want you to lead their army Jason. They want you to become the driving force in wiping us out” he says and I’m stunned.                                                       “I wouldn’t never do that!” I protest outraged                                                   “I’m sure you wouldn’t but they seem certain that you will if they get hold of you.”                                                                                   “So what I’m supposed to run and hide? Make sure I don’t get caught?” I ask him                                                                                           “no. we have to go from being the prey to being the predator. I know where they are. They have friends of mine still in cages. They have grown arrogant and over confident and think we are weak. Let’s show them what two Umbrian’s can do.” He says eagerly his voice full of detest for his captors.                                                    “I can’t leave them here alone. What if the hunters come here?” I argue
“They won’t. They are actually waiting for you to go and rescue the others” he says smiling                                                                                                 “so why would we go there and do exactly what they want?”                         “Because the plan was for me to be dead and you to march in in a craze. But now there is two Umbrian’s pissed at them. Cool, calm and ready but there is one problem. As soon as we leave the mole will tell them”                                                                                           “so we have to get rid of the moles” I say raising an eyebrow                            “just alpha and Connor. The others only followed out of fear” he says and I nod                                                                                                  “are you in any state to fight?” I ask and he laughs                                             “I’m an Umbrian. I’m always ready to fight” jumping to his feet the weariness has vanished as his body heals and we set out in search of the fakes, the old man and the best friend.                                     As the two of us walk through the building we draw looks of curiosity from everyone we pass. Many welcome my brother home but he ignores them focused on our objective.                                             We march into the dining room and find the pair sat there with Ryan and Luke talking in hushed whispers. My brother starts to move forward but I hold him back.                                                                   “Ryan. Luke. Move away. They are the ones that lead the hunters here” I say firmly and they rise to their feet but don’t move away growling angrily eager to stay and fight.                                                      “Move away. This is to be fair” I say and reluctantly the pair walk away. Alpha and Connor don’t move staying seated looking calm at their discovery                                                                                              “fair. Two werewolves against a werewolf and lycan both of which are Umbrian’s. Yes that’s fair” alpha comment dryly                                “and its fair that werewolves and lycans had to die because of your betrayal.” I hiss                                                                                          “this world isn’t fair. It was us or you and we caved and saved ourselves.” Connor pleads                                                                                      “has it all been a lie? A trap for me to fall into?” I ask and he nods.                                                                                                                   “From the start. I knew who you was and what you was destined to be. It was my job to get close to you.” he says no hint of apology in his voice and as the pair sit there almost happy for us to kill them I think about what Luke said as I feel myself start to change.                                                                                       “You won’t let him kill me Jason. You’re still my friend” Connor says and I smile                                                                                                      “no I won’t” I say and a smug satisfied smile crosses his lips but as my throat starts changes and my teeth lengthen I growl out                                                                                                                       “because I’m going to kill you myself.”                                              The rooms a flurry of fur and fangs as we change a pair of white and grey wolves against a pair of Umbrian’s.  Alpha dives for my brother and the pair roil across the floor smacking into the wall breaking the plaster. I’m about to rush to his aid as Connor leaps and digs his teeth into my forearm making me howl in pain as I pull him off and toss him across the floor rolling and rolling in a ball of fur. Momentarily free I check on my brother to find him limping with alpha marching towards him growling. I leap between them growling and swing my claws at his face pushing him back. My brother tries to push past me to fight but I don’t let him pushing him back gently with my foot making his growl softly in irritation. The pair of liars regroup and move forward as one. Without a second thought I charge at the two moving faster than anyone can follow, running on all fours my claws cutting into the floor and tackle the pair to the floor. Their whimpers are music to my ears as I fell bones snap from the collision. Connor lays there unable to move nursing his back leg but alpha rises shakily to his feet defiance in his eyes.                                                                               Marching towards him intent on finishing him he bursts into life moving like a bullet leaping like a rabbit clattering into my chest with all fours, his claws rip at my skin and I feel my own blood flow. He doesn’t get a chance to sink his teeth into my neck as a black shadow pounces across my chest and knocks him to the floor. I don’t need to look as I hear alpha whine and wheeze before falling silent, hitting the floor with a dull thud and our attention falls on Connor. He lays there now in his human form sobbing nursing his injured leg and I feel terrible. As I look at him I remember the day he left me and I fill with anger but then I think of everything else and I can’t.                     “Go.” I say almost not wanting to say it and he doesn’t move either in disbelief or just doesn’t hear                                                               “ go before I change my mind” I shout and he doesn’t waste time pulling himself to his feet and begins to limp away                                  “ No one is to harm him. Let him go” I shout my voice echoing across the walls but I don’t move trying to regain control the emotions tearing my apart                                                     “You could have died trying to fight them alone” he says plainly                                                                                                                      “could have but then you could have died too. You shouldn’t have fought.” I say in a more heartfelt tone                                                         “it had to be done. Who taught you to fight?” he asks changing the subject                                                                                                  “no one. I’ve only been a lycan for a week.” I tell him and him looks at me surprised                                                                                          “a week? How on earth did you become alpha within a week?” he says curious                                                                                                “it’s a long story” I say shrugging my shoulders not eager to talk about my first kill                                                                                          “come find me once you’ve cleaned yourself up. We need to leave as soon as possible “He say rising and walking out leaving me with the two bodies.                                                                 “I don’t know what the hunters done to put in that position but I swear they will not hurt anyone again. This has to end. This will end.” I say softly as I close their eyes and walk out the room to find Luke and Ryan stood there waiting.                                              “It was them all along” Luke growls outraged                                                        “yes but they won’t be any trouble anymore” I say sadly                                   “I’ll arrange the clean-up but what happens now? The hunters will realise their dead” Ryan asks sounding afraid                                                “now we fight back. Aaron know where there camp is holding countless lycans and werewolves captive. We are going to free them” I say                                                                                                        “what about everyone here? If you take everyone there to fight then who will defend them?” Ryan asks angrily                                                 “just me and Aaron are going. I want the pair of you to lead them in my absence.” I tell them and they don’t know what to say.                                                                                                                      “That’s crazy. Two of you against an army of hunters?” Luke says looking at me like I’ve gone crazy                                                            “two of us is all it takes” I reply confident                                                           “at least let me come with you” Luke pleads                                                     “no. I need you here. I’ll be fine” I say although I would love to have him at my side                                                                                             “I understand. It’s crazy but I understand. Good luck telling Lucy.” He says smiling before leaving with Ryan in tow.                                    Routing through my clothes I realise that in the space of a few days almost half my clothes have been ruined. Taking a mental note to try and replace it I change into a fresh set. I’m about to head out the door when Lucy stops me leaning up against the door way she blocks my path, the scowl on her face showing her anger.                                                                                                          “Why did you have to kill alpha?” she asks sadly brushing my cheek.                                                                                             “They were the ones that brought the hunters here. The tracking us was a lie. They have been using our own kind to find us” I say sadly slightly upset about the way things have played out                             “so you had to kill them?” she asks calmly                                                      “yes. If I let them leave they would have told the hunters and then we would be in big trouble” I say almost apologising to her.                                                                                                                   “I understand.” She says hugging me tight an embrace I return but she doesn’t seem convinced                                                                           “what’s wrong Jason?” she asks breaking away from me                                    “Aaron and I are leaving.  The hunters have werewolf’s prisoner so we are going to get them back” I tell her                                              “and what if the hunters come here?” she asks frightened                                   “then Luke and the others will keep you safe.” I tell her reaching out                                                                                                  “you’re going alone?” she says puzzled                                                            “just Aaron and me.”                                                                                    “Why do you have to go? It’s the werewolves fight not yours” she pleads holding my face with both hands.                                                     “It’s our fight. The hunters don’t discriminate so neither can we” I reply and she smiles                                                                                     “I knew there was a reason I feel for you” she smiles peaking my on the cheek with her ruby red lips.                                                          “Promise me that you will come back” she says sternly holding my gaze                                                                                                           “I promise”                                                                                                   “where’s your brother then? I want to tell him to keep you safe” she demands                                                                                            “I’m going to find him now” I tell her and together we walk out her arm linked with mine and as she walks at my side I feel complete.                                                                                                           It doesn’t take long to find Aaron sat there being tended to by Anne and the sight makes me laugh to myself as I her his protests fall on deaf ears                                                                                      “ I’m fine really” he says overwhelmed by the mother hen that is Anne                                                                                                                   “ no you are not fine. Those chains left horrid silver gunk all over your legs and it was to come off” Anne argues scrubbing at his lower legs with a cloth so hard I’m surprised he has any skin left at all                                                                                                             “Jason! Please tell her that I’m okay” he pleads as he sees us walk in but only but smiling I don’t say a word.                                             “I don’t know what you’re laughing about Jason, I’m looking over your next” Anne scowls and it’s the turn of Aaron to laugh at my expression                                                                                                 “I’m fine Anne. I heal remember” I tell her and she shakes her head.                                                                                                                 “That doesn’t mean it won’t get infected does it.” She says and my face drops                                                                                       “go on you. You’re worse than your brother” Anne laughs and Aaron eagerly hops down and seems almost stunned at the lack of pain.                                                                                                             “You must be Aaron” Lucy says sweetly holding out her hand                           “I am. You must be Lucy. I’ve heard a lot of things about you” he replies his eyes flicking from her to me and back again.                           “Okay yes we are together now can we please behave like grownups” I groan holding Lucy close as she beams at me obviously happy.                                                                                                 “Of course. Have you told her?” he asks and I nod eager to hear what he has planned.                                                                                      “Have you ever been in the town of Rathcoole?” he asks and the mention of my old home sends a wave of nostalgia over me.                           “It’s where I lived before I came here” I tell him                                                 “perfect. In one of the houses there’s a secret basement leading into a network of tunnels and rooms. They are being held down there. To get down there we will need to get one of the hunter to open it. Once inside we will have to move quickly the hunters will move in as soon as the alarm is raised. Then there isn’t much we can do but run” he says leaving me to sit there and think over it.                                                                                                      “Perfect. Let’s do it” I say eager to free the captives and Aaron smiles at my eagerness                                                                                        “the hunters will have no idea what hit them”                                                                                
  
“How did you end up with the werewolves anyway?” I ask Aaron as we walk. The air is chilly for this time of year as the sunset painting the sky with purples and oranges.                                               “I was five when they attacked. They stormed the house with such force we couldn’t hope to fight back. bullets flied everywhere and all I could do was stand there screaming mummy” he starts scoffing at himself                                                                     “ I remember one of them levelled a gun right at my head and was about to shoot before dad tackled him to the floor. RUN! RUN! He screamed at me so I did I ran out the back door and I didn’t stop running. I never looked back. I ran till I collapsed from exhaustion and when I woke I was laying in the bed of the werewolf pack’s alpha with him sat at my side. He took me under his wing and raised my as a son” he finishes and a lone tear rolls down his cheek.                                                                                          “What about you how did you end up with the lycans? And become their alpha so quick?” he asks wiping his face almost ashamed at the showing of emotion                                                                  “I had been raised by the hunters for all my life without knowing it. Connor had been my best friend for my human life then Luke and Sarah found me tried to what I thought was kidnap me and I ran into the forest and Luke turned me. I left with them and arriving at the camp I end up fighting the alpha. My uncle for the right to lead and won.” I tell him leaving out Lucy. His hatred of hunters so deep I doubt he will see it my way.                                                                                                                       “It’s not always like this. Fighting, killing it isn’t the way we are. The hunters have pushed us to this so know it’s time for us to push back.                                                                                                         “Do you know my name?” I ask out of the blue and he looks at me confused                                                                                                      “no one knows the name mum and dad gave me I was hoping you might know” I ask hoping, praying for an answer                                    “they did name you Jason. That is your name.” he says smiling and I’m glad to put the identity crisis behind me.                                          “We are almost there so we need to lay low. The entire town is a hunter’s nest. We need to find someone alone and find out the house with the stairwell down.” He says whispering into my ear                        “I know the house with someone. Well they should be” I say and he looks at me surprised and eager.                                                             “Let’s go to my house”                                                                                   “how are we going to get there though?” Aaron asks as I take lead.                                                                                                                    “We walk in.” I say full of confidence as this time it doesn’t leave me.                                                                                                          Walking back down the streets I walked down as a child pulls of my heart strings as memories flood my mind but I don’t cave in. I’m here for a reason and I’m not going to let anything distract me.                                                                                                        Neither of us say a word and move quickly blending in as we draw closer to my house. The sight of the familiar four walls should be a joy to behold but it’s not my home anymore. Coming to the door I slowly push down on the handle and find the door unlocked as it opens with a gentle crack. The house is exactly as I remember it and so is David who stands in the middle of the stairs his jaw dropping as he sees me stood there.                      “Mum!” he scream running back up the stairs terrified of me.            Aaron walks in behind me and closes the door behind him and we don’t have to wait long till the woman I thought was my mum for long emerges from the kitchen completely un aware we are there to her eyes fall on the pair of us and the mug in her hand slips loose from her hand falling onto the hard tile floor smashing into a thousand pieces the tea inside covering the floor.                                                                                                                   “We need your help” I say calmly but she doesn’t reply. Doesn’t even move.                                                                                                 “ you are going to open up the tunnels for us” I demand as I walk towards her making her tremble on the spot                                              “ please don’t hurt me Jason” she quivers and I smile                                       “ I won’t. Just do as I ask and I give you my word you won’t be harmed” I tell her and slowly she walks past me and towards the sitting room. As she opens up the door once more Aaron seems to grow nervous.                                                                                          “Come on Aaron lets go” I instruct and he heads down ahead of me leaving the shaken woman behind. The room stinks of silver churning my stomach so much I have to pull my top over my nose to filter the worst.                                                                                  “Here we might need these” Arron says tossing a pair of silver pistols to me                                                                                                        “I don’t know how to use these” I agree as I look at the weapons                                                                                                               “it’s simple. Point and shoot.” He replies sliding a pair into his trousers and pushing the door to the tunnels open and side by side we enter the hornets’ nest. The empty hornets’ nest.                                       The halls so white its blinding and air so neutral I can’t smell a thing.                                                                                                                “Where is everyone?” I ask Aaron as we walk cautiously  Aaron leading in the unfamiliar surroundings                                                                  “ I don’t know and as long as the others are here I don’t care” he says harshly as push on through the building passing countless doors all of which must lead somewhere but Aaron seems to know where he’s going so I don’t question him. We are about to go round a corner when he swings back hugging the wall and with a finger on his lips tells me to be quiet.                                               “There’s two guards outside the door.” He whispers reaching down towards the guns at his side                                                                     “you start shooting now we’ll have the whole lot down on top of us.” I whisper with venom                                                                                “do they know what you look like? Human?” I ask a plan forming in my head.                                                                                          “No I was a wolf the whole time. If I changed they would know who I was” he replies still not clicking on                                                            “then you can be the boy that calls wolf” I say smiling and knowing fills his eyes. Taking the gun from his side he lays them on the floor quietly he takes a deep breath and jumps into the fire                                                                                                                  “Help! Quick! Wolves!” he screams running towards them and I can only imagine what he must look like as I stand here waiting. I can hear them coming their footsteps betray them as they run. Whooshing around the corner I crack one in the face with a backhand of the guns handle and he falls to the floor still but alive. The second moves fast ditching the gun and pulling out a small military knife but I can tell by the smell it’s not silver. Swinging for my face I don’t even bother moving as it hits the side of my face stopping dead and although it hurts I don’t flinch and the man  in front of me freezes in fear a quick right hook to the temple and he’s out for the count.  Raising my hand to my cheek I soon move it away as my cheek is so tender touching it feels like it’s about to fall apart. Rushing around the corner I find Aaron trying to push down on the door failing.                           “get out the way” I shout as I charge at the door building up as much speed as I can before crashing into the door with such force that it flies of the hinges and as I stand up brushing myself down I get to look at the prison I have unveiled                          Cages fill the room stacked on top of each other all holding a lone wolf. So small that they can barely move, a tiny mockery of a food and water bowl sits in the corner. The slam of the door reverberates around the room and one by one their heads perk up eager to see what’s going on and hope fills their hearts.                                                                                  I run to the nearest cage the wolf inside so skinny its ribs are visible and fur matted into horrid clumps. I reach out to the bars but have to let go as the bars burn into my skin                                         “the bars are pure silver. One of their tricks to try and break us” Aaron spits his hands just as red as mine but looking down I can see the burns heal within seconds and I know what I have to do. Gritting my teeth as the flesh on my palms melts I grab the bars again locked cage door and pull ripping the door of with relative ease. The captive inside looks at me half grateful before darting out the cage and joining the side of the others. I fly down the room tearing off door after door. Lose myself in the action blanking out everything else so to not feel the pain till there is no one left trapped and looking up I find the room full of wolves stood waiting all eager to follow. Aaron not me.                                  “Lead them from the front show the way out. Ill cover the rear” I shout and in huge wave we run through the door and through the halls towards our salvation. We coat through unchallenged till our safety is in sight till my ears are touched by the sound of heavy footsteps behind us. Close behind us. Arron starts leading the out waiting at the threshold of my old home I stop to join him standing against the wall to let the wolves out.                                 “Get the home safe. Look after them for me” I say to him the sadness making my voice quiver before as the last wolf slips through I push Aaron out the way and slam the bolted door shut on myself. Quickly scouring the room I pick up another gun even though I have no idea how to use them and march back down into the pits of hell.                                                                 They have barley come into sight around the corner when I start firing all over the place driving them out of my depth with the weapons improvising on the spot.                                              “There’s no point in that Jason. We can talk like human beings.” A gruff voice shouts stepping out from them his hands in the air. His grey hair barley covering his head and light green eyes seem faded.                                                                                                  “Talk about what?” I shout back still holding the gun aimed at his chest.                                                                                                             “About the fact that you have it all wrong. We aren’t the ones you should be fighting” he says confident that I will listen and when I don’t say a word he continues                                                                 “we are not humans. We are a team of werewolves and lycans. We make sure the rules of our race are upheld. We are the police force of wolven kind and you just helped in a mass prison breakout. I’m not angry at you, just disappointed” he says shaking his head in disappointment.                                                                    “You’re lying.” I hiss unable to believe I’ve been tricked like that                                                                                                                     “we are hunters but we hunt rouge wolves. They are lying to you Jason. We didn’t kill your parents. Your parents were two of our best. They left when you was born but that didn’t stop them hunting them down. We saved you from being killed by the very people you help.” He says speaking to me like a child that refuses to listen.                                                                                     “I can prove it.” He smiles raising his hand gesturing one of the armed guards forward who follows without question.                                          “Change” he commands and no sooner have the words his mouth has the man changed into a wolf. His fur a light grey and of average size in werewolf terms but his clothes are still together somehow changing shape with him now fitting him just like it had as a human.                                                                                   “Go. Go back to your friends. To your brother and find the truth for yourself. We will not follow. We will wait here” he says as my hand trembles not in fear or tiredness but from the horrible feeling that he could be telling truth.                                         “Wait there is one thing I don’t understand. When I came home just after being turned why they had left. Mum and dad?” I ask and he stops turning around he says quickly                                                    “because we believed that you could turn them around. The last Umbrian is a lycan like no other. We thought that you might be able to stop it.” He says leaving quickly before I can ask another question so with a mind full of questions and confusion I leave the tunnels and head into my old home to find the place ruined the furniture shredded, the wooden floor scratched by the claws and I feel slightly guilty. Sat on the now ruined sofa though is a bundle of just folded clothes. A pair of black combat trousers and a black camo jacket with only a note sat on top saying the choice is yours. I scoff at the idea I would wear a hunter uniform and dart out the door leaving my home one again to begin the long walk home to find out the truth.                                   I’m coming close to the house when it becomes apparent that something has changed as I find cars abandoned in the road their doors left wide open and their engines still running. Dots of blood cover the floor and the vehicles.                                                            “HELP! PLEASE!” a woman screams ahead of me just out of view and even as tired as I am I cannot ignore a cry for help like that and I’m disgusted by what I see.                                                               Five wolves surround a woman clutching a baby to her chest sobbing in fear for her life and the child’s as the wolves snap and growl toying with the mother. Running across the top of an abandoned car I leap into the middle landing just in front of the woman petrifying the wolves in front of me.                                            “What are you doing!?” I growl outraged at what they had done, what they were doing but obviously they don’t reply just look at me confused                                                                                  “Jason? You’re alive” Aaron gasps emerging from the distance his hands and face dripping blood, his clothes tattered and I know what he’s done.                                                                                       “what are you doing Aaron?!” why are you doing this?!” I shout sick to my stomach at the sight of him.                                                 “What I always planned to do. Lead the fight against humanity” he laughs.                                                                                                          “By killing innocents? By slaughtering families? You are the sort of werewolf that makes us hated” I growl                                                    “no one is innocent. How many of our families have been slaughtered for no reason!? MY Family! I had a fiancé and daughter! Then the humans came and killed them, tried to kill me. I swore that day that I would do everything in my power to stop them but the hunters didn’t want that. They want to keep hiding to keep living in segregation so they arrested me and anyone that agreed with me. Ask anyone and they will say that they want to be free. Why should we have to hide because of what we are?” He shouts angry and full of belief in his cause                            “this is not the way to do it Aaron.” I plead even though it’s futile                                                                                                                     “violence is the only way humanity know how to solve its problems but this is a war it will not be able to win. We have allies everywhere. The greed of humanity for power is a sickness we can prey on.” He says proudly as the five wolves close in on me and the woman Aaron’s speech reminding them of their fight, their struggle.                                                                              “Do not stand in the way Jason. You might be the last pure Umbrian but even you cannot fight off all of us alone” he says almost pleading but I’m sure he knows I will not stand aside.                            “Please not my baby. Save my baby please I beg you” the woman shriek offering the baby to me ready to sacrifice herself to save the child.                                                                                              “What’s her name?” I ask her and the calmness of my voice steady’s her                                                                                                         “Emma. Her name is Emma” she sniffs realising I’m on her side                                                                                                     “I can save your daughter but to do that I will have to leave you. Are you sure?” I ask her sending the wolves sprinting towards us not wanting to let me slip away.                                                      “ yes please save my daughter” she says steeling herself as I slowly take the child from her holding her in my arms as it gurgles happily in my arms barely five months old dressed in a bright pink dress.                                                                                            I don’t waste a second leaping over the nearest wolf barely avoiding its snapping fangs landing with a thud I tighten my hold on the child and run my legs already aching under me but I ignore it and run both my and the babies life hanging on the result of the chase. The hunt is on. All I can hear if the rhythmic thud of my feet on the floor and the yapping of the wolves behind me slowly getting louder. Their legs fresh and the adrenaline flowing in their veins but I don’t give up hoping they might get bored and give up but that’s only a false hope to keep my legs moving and hold back tears I know they won’t give up. Werewolves and lycans never give up.     
So now I’m left with a choice. Do I keep running with the false hope of escape or stop and try to fight while looking after a baby a feat that sounds impossible. Two options both almost certain to end in failure. I reach the end of the trail of abandoned cars and stop as a plan forms in my mind. I dash to the nearest car with its doors open and lay the child on the back seats praying that it will not move before flicking the locks on the doors and slamming them shut making the baby start to cry the noise making my heart ache like nothing I’ve ever felt before.                                                                                                                     “Finally you stopped running. I thought you would run forever” Aaron laughs changing back his clothes torn, the blood on his face and hands dried and cracking. Peeling of like a snake’s skin.                                                                                                                    “You don’t have to do this Aaron.” I plead as his followers start to push towards me intent on reaching the child in the car                                “ I’m afraid I do see if you are not going to help us then you are going to stand in our way so it’s best to settle it now” he says grinning like a chaser cat as two wolves close in on me                                    “ then you leave me no choice” I reply ready as I change and as I stand there flexing out in the familiar form I see a sense of unease creep into the wolves as they stand routed to the spot.                               “What are you waiting for? Kill him” Aaron shouts and they move in.                                                                                                          The first wolf, a light brown skinny thing leaps for my throat but I simply swat it away with my huge palm sending him rolling across the floor. The second an ox of a wolf with a light grey coat seizes the distraction and sinks his teeth into my shin, his teeth only stopping at the bone and I howl in pain trying to kick him off but his jaw is locked and all I achieve is dragging his fangs trough more skin and muscle. The third and fourth wolves start to move round to the opposite side of the car and to thought of the child in danger sends a new wave of strength through my veins and also a rage I cannot control. Reaching down I grab the latched on wolves head his both hands and slowly pry his jaw open and with my razor sharp claws I rip open the wolf’s throat, the blood runs like a torrent before I drop it to the floor and leap over the car and swing at the pair of wolves missing the first but catching the seconds face ripping through its cheek sending it whining way holing a paw to its face. The missed wolf looks at his fallen colleague and back at me before turning around with its tail between its legs its friend whimpering as it stumbles to keep up with him. I stand there panting thinking that its over before something crashes into my back smashing my face into the floor and I feel my nose pop. I roll over using all the strength in my shoulder shaking the attacker off an climb to my feet but as I put weight onto my injured leg I feel it give way and like a shark my attacker Aaron moves in. circling me, toying with me as I growl at him my body drenched in blood a ix of mine and theirs. I limp around the car trying to keep a line of sight but he moves so fast that with my injures leg I have no chance to keep up and he clatters into my chest smashing me into the floor sending the wind from my lungs and a stars flying but I have enough sense to reach out and stop his fangs from sinking into my throat his saliva coating my face as I struggle to hold him back till an unknown force tackles him off me and as I pull myself to my feet I find him squaring off with another lycan but this lycans fur isn’t black. It’s silver. One after one werewolves appear all clad in the hunter uniform and Arron realising that he’s out matched runs moving so fast that my eyes struggle to follow. The silver lycan changes back and as I thought the hunter silver stands in its place. With the threat gone the adrenaline leaves my blood to be replaced with pain. Sheering pain form my injured leg as I limp towards the car where I hid the baby, each step a new level of agony filling the world with red and sends my eyelids fluttering. I’m only a few feet away but it feels like miles and as I fall onto the door and look in on the baby still laying there sniffling a light smile closes my face before the blood loss and pain become too much and I slide down the side of the door the skin on my face stretching trying to hold me up till it hits the cold tarmac. I lay there gazing into the distance down the road towards my home. My friends and slowly it disappears consumed by light. Coming towards me obliterating anything in its path till reaches me and the world disappears in a flash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    






“I should have done with him. It’s crazy for the two of them to go alone” I protest for what must be the hundredth time to Ryan sat across from me a cup of coffee in his hand.                                                   “You did what any one would have.  You done what he asked” Ryan replies reassuring but I still can’t help the feeling that something’s going to go wrong.                                                                       “But I…….if I……” I start trying to think of a way to protest but my words fail me.                                                                                             “They will be fine Luke. Two Umbrian’s. One of each race, Jason wouldn’t have gone if he didn’t believe they could pull it off” Ryan says total faith in his, our alpha and friend.                                             “I still don’t like it.” I spit                                                                             “ you don’t have to like it just accept it” Ryan says sharply before sipping his coffee and grimacing in a face that sends me chuckling and he smiles                                                                    “ there is hope for you yet then” he laughs and I can’t help but smile.                                                                                                               “Your right. I should have a bit more faith.” I smile bracing myself for the snippy remark but I don’t get one as he sits there his ears almost pricked up listening a concerned look on his face.                                                                                                                      “What’s wrong Ryan” I ask my heart racing praying it’s not what I fear                                                                                                                  “they’re back but something’s wrong” he says his hearing much better than mine. The words have barley left my mouth when I disappear out the door darting through the hallway into the courtyard where Aaron stands a new pack of wolves around him growling and snapping at anyone that gets too close                                  Lucy appears beside me giving me a start moving so silently even Ryan didn’t hear her.                                                                                 “What’s going on?” I shout pushing past the crowd in front of me so I’m face to face with Aaron.                                                                       “Jason is dead. I’m alpha now” he says a smile on his face as wails of sorrow come from behind me. From Lucy.                                               “No he isn’t” a voice says in the crowd and slowly hobbling through the crowd appears Connor his leg mangled.                                       “He’s alive even though you tried your best to kill him” he shouts and a sinister smile crosses Aaron’s lips.                                              “Really? I thought he would be easier to kill. I’m impressed”                              “you bastard!” I cry charging towards him my mind filed with anger and betrayal and he doesn’t move almost happy to take the challenge but as fast as I move I’m not the first one to him as Ryan flies out from the crowd tackling him to the floor and I’m about to rush to his side when I catch sight of Connor with Lucy waving for me to go to them. Looking back at Aaron and Ryan only to have my heart shattered as Ryan lays there his throat in Aarons throat blood dripping down his neck his lips quivering as he chokes out his last words                                                                              “ go. Run. Find Jason and keep him safe” before the fangs close and his soul leaves his body and fighting every bone in my body, every instinct in my soul with Connor and Lucy I run. We run round the house hopping over the wall into the field but Connor struggles to keep up limping on the bumpy surface as the wolves close in eager to reach us for their own bit of bloodshed                                                                                                            “leave me. Run go to the forest where you found Jason. A friend will be waiting” he says prepared for his fate                                        “no. no one else is dying today but them” I declare looking to Lucy.                                                                                                                   “Do you think you will be able to carry him” I ask her and she nods                                                                                                                  “I won’t be able to move very fast” she says and I reply with a sinister smile of my own                                                                                  “you don’t need to. When I’m done there won’t be anyone following us”                                                                                                       she changes there and then he clothes a worry for a lesser time and Connor as quickly as he can pulls himself onto her back and in a slow jog they leave me with three wolves crowding around me and I tut                                                                                                           “ three? Is that all you think it takes to kill a lycan?” before changing not even attempting to put a cap on the animal inside that I have spent years learning to do. Nothing more than a spectator in my own body. The three wolves don’t stand a chance. Full of arrogance they try to toy with me walking around me in a circle trying to get me spinning but I stand my ground one leaps from the side a skinny excuse for an animal as I catch it in one hand and squeeze no quarrels in my mind what to do dropping its lifeless body to the floor. One of the two remaining wolves distraught at the sight of its dead friend dives for my leg but I’m faster moving the leg back out of reach before launching a kick to the side of the wolves head, I can hear the bones in its neck snap and it lays there breathing but not doing much else. It probably never will again.                                            The last wolf starts to back away afraid but I’m full of bloodlust and I’m not going to let it go that easy it turns to bolt and the chase begins though it only lasts a few seconds as my claws catch it in the back digging in deep like a hook stopping it is its tracks before slowly pulling them out blood welling up in the holes running down its side like five small waterfalls.                                     It lays there whimpering in pain and as the beast retreats giving me control once more almost grateful for the release I change back not worried about the clothes hanging of me in rags and run to re-join my friends the anger in my heart supressed for now but the sorrow in my soul pushes. It makes my tears flow running down my cheeks onto the grass below, it sets my lips quivering and drains my throat of moisture.                                           The only thing holding it back is hope. Hope that Jason is alive.                      Lucy and Connor have moved faster than I had expected and drained from the fight I can manage nothing more than a slow walk. My feet filthy rom walking on the mud, my skin covered in Goosebumps from being exposed to the cool wind but I carry on determined to reach them. As I clamber clumsily over a fence between two fields I fall landing face first on the floor only to get a heart attack as I lift my head to find a cow stood there staring at me full of curiosity and it makes me chuckle.                              “Sorry cow. I was just passing through” I laugh pulling myself to my feet brushing off what tiny bit of dirt I can.                                              “Don’t worry. Are you okay?” a voice asks and I look around me puzzled as to where the voice comes from.                                                   “What happened to you? You look like you just went through a wood chipper” the voice says light heartedly and the source steps out from behind the cow. An old man covered in just as much mud as me in his mouldy green wellies, checked top and dark grey overcoat his grey hair long kept tidy and his chin covered by a slowly thickening stubble.                                                            “It’s complicated.” I reply smiling thinking how it must look to him.                                                                                                                      “I’m sure it is. Here” he says tossing an old pair of boots at me stinking of sweat but I put them on gratefully                                                  “ I think I might have an old coat in the back of the car that you can have come on” he says holding out a hand to help me to my feet not leaving any room for an argument.                                                        “Why help me? I’m just a stranger?” I ask curious the kindness of a stranger confusing me.                                                                     “Because if someone found me or someone I cared about in that situation I know I would be grateful.” He says over his shoulder leading me through the field the boots far too large for me and walking is cumbersome. Coming to the gate out onto the road he slowly starts to pull it back obviously struggling so I step in lifting the heavy with one arm, both out for show and slowly move it back before dropping it to the floor                                          “thank you.” He says tipping his hat as he walks round before I close it behind us. His car a beat up beamer older than my parents the engine spitting and spluttering a huge ball of smoke coming from the exhaust.                                                                                  “Here it might be a bit big for you but it’ll fend off the worst of the cold.” He says smiling holding out a thick black coat the material starting the wear but I slide it on grateful for the strangers generosity.                                                                                      “It’s a perfect fit” he says smiling like he’s passed a family heirloom onto his son as I brush off any light dirt and smoothen the fabric.                                                                                                                   “Thank you so much….” I start before realising that I don’t even know the man’s name.                                                                                 “Shaun. Where you heading I could give you a ride? I’m heading back home that way” he says his kindness knowing no bounds as he points back down where I’ve come from                                     “ I wouldn’t take that road” I warn eager to warn him of the danger but if I tell him wolves are out on the streets we will surely ignore me.                                                                                           “There doing roadwork’s down there and it takes an age to get through I lie hoping it’s enough                                                                          “I’ll take the longer route home then. Thanks for the tip” he smiles climbing into his front seat                                                                          “ thank you for the coat” I shout struggling to be heard over the engine and with a friendly wave I watch him drive off into the distance before starting my journey again.                                                    As I walk my mind can’t stop thinking about Ryan. He didn’t deserve to die like that. He didn’t deserve to die at all. He had thought so hard for the pack, for me. He saved my life countless times but I couldn’t save his. The idea of going back fighting them myself is tempting, very tempting but my loyalty to my alpha is stronger. I have to carry on and reach Jason.                                As I walk drawing closer to my goal I wonder if maybe it’s all been a lie. Am I leaping out of the frying pan and into the fire?  Connor is a hunter the people that caused the pain and hatred in the first place. They killed Ryan’s sister, they killed Jason’s parents so why did he trust them? I can only trust my friend’s judgement and pray that he’s right.                                                     Coming to the outskirts of the town I find the streets deserted, all the curtains shut. A light breeze shaking the branches the only movement, the only sound. I pass through alone lucky not to been seen walking around in wellies and a coat. The forest seems different this time and as I retrace my steps I can almost see the events that day. We hadn’t changed to kill or even frighten Jason. We changed because we came under attack. The hunters came after us. It was only by chance that we ran into him and I lost control I don’t know why I changed him but I’m glad I did.                                                                                                    The forest has changed in the week since we was last here and I’m unsure of where I’m supposed to be going following only memory and instinct as I push the low hanging leaves and branches out of my way till I find Connor, Lucy and an old man whose face I don’t recognise are stood together waiting presumably for me                                                                                              “ Luke” Lucy cries running across the space between us throwing herself at me locking her arms around my neck crying into my shoulder                                                                                    “ where’s Jason?” I growl heart racing my worst fears seem to be realised                                                                                                               “he’s inside. He’s….he’s” Lucy starts before bursting into a fresh torrent of tears.                                                                                     “He’s in a coma. Aaron and his gang attacked him. He fought back but the numbers where too great” the old man say with both admiration and scorn for his actions                                                            “no. he can’t be. He…..he” I stammer at a total loss for words.                       “Come we should get inside and I’ll explain everything” the old man finishes waving us inside and against my better judgment I follow them into the lion’s den.                                                                     Connor and the old man lead the way with me and Lucy following behind holding each other in comfort for the terrible news. The smell of chemicals and silver hits us in a wave filling my nostrils and lungs making me sick to my stomach and from the look and colour of Lucy’s face I can tell she feels the same but we continue to follow.                                                         “Why are you helping us? You tried to kill us last time we met hunters.” I ask confused                                                                                     “that wasn’t us. That was Aarons pack. He’s been pulling all the strings from the start. He’s the one that had you attacked. He’s the leader of a pack of what we call rouges. Werewolves and lycan that despise humanity and want to take it over” Connor explains as we walk drawing curious glances from those we pass many dressed in a strange army uniform socialising or working on something                                                                                    “but he’s Jason’s brother. Why would he want to kill him?” I ask the explanation only raising more questions.                                                          “He isn’t Jason’s brother. Alpha lied.” Connor says his voice drifting off at the mention of his friend’s name. A pain I can relate to.                                                                                                      “Why? Why would he tell him that Aaron is his brother?”                                         “Because alpha was a rouge as were many others that we trusted. They knew if he had family to chase he would.”                                      “So who is his brother?” I ask wondering if the whole thing is a lie                                                                                                                      “that’s just it. He doesn’t have a brother. He was an only child” Connor says and I feel Lucy go cold.                                                           “Aarons known everything from the start because someone’s been on the inside since the start” Connor growls as I push Lucy off in complete shock.                                                                                       “You told him he had a brother Lucy” I say so close to rage but the guilt in her eyes makes we wait a second                                                    “I was sent to get close to him. To get myself into his life and report back but I after that I didn’t say a word. I fell for him okay. I fell for the person I was supposed to betray so I couldn’t” she pleads hoping that we would understand and my heart is so torn I want to tear her head for even the intention of betraying us but the fear of hurting my friend when he wakes up stops me                                                                                                         “Jason can decide what to do with you when he wakes up. When you tell him” I growl and she nods obediently                                             “where is Jason? I want to see him” I growl but the old man only smiles                                                                                                               “of course. This way” he says leading us further into the network of corridors.                                                                                               No one says a word as we walk there and when we do get there I’m glad I saved my breath as I see him lying there. His eyes closed laying there perfectly still the only indication of life the constant beep of machines and the rising of his chest and as shocking as that is there is one thing even more shocking. He’s in him human form other than his right leg that is still a lycan leg covered in the same jet black fur the only difference is the size perfectly in tune with the rest of his body.                                                        “We don’t know what happened with his leg. It was extremely wounded so it might have stayed like that to heal. We don’t know” the old man says reading my mind as I stand there looking on at my friend laying there wondering if he can hear anything that’s going on.                                                  





 
The world comes into focus and I find myself stood in the forest where everything began. The air is bitterly cold and frost clings to the ground and trees, the leaves shrivelling into crisps.  Confusion sends me spinning wondering how on earth I got here and what happened to the weather.                                                           “Hello?” I shout receiving only a strange echo back, my voice twisted into a voice without emotion.                                                    “hello” a voice says behind me and spinning around I fall over my feet only to look up and be glad I’m already on the floor as I find a pair of red eyes peering into mine. The red eyes belong to a black wolf larger than any other I’ve seen but it’s faded like a ghost. The trees visible through its body.                                                   “Where am I?” I ask it not afraid just confused. Lost                                           “you’re in purgatory” it says calmly as if death is no big deal                               “I’m dead” I gasp devastated. It can’t be over for me. Not yet                                     “dying. There’s a difference” the ghost replies coolly and I’m lost for words.                                                                                                      “So that’s it then. I have to wait here to die” I shout distraught at my early exit.                                                                                                  
“

The world, the real world slowly comes into focus and just from the smell, sterile and full of chemicals I know that I’m not where I was a moment ago. Slowly sitting up I feel a pull on my arm and looking down find a small plastic tube connected to my skin. My first thought is to pull it out but I hesitate as I look down at my leg but I don’t find it. Instead I find my wolven leg only slightly covered by the hospital gown in in its  slightly smaller than normal with my toes ending in claws instead of toes and I’m about to freak out when I remember what umbra said there is a price to paid. Looking around me trying to work out where I am I find myself alone in a room so white it makes my eyes hurt. The only furniture the bad I’m lying on and a door that blends into walls almost invisible. Unnerved I spring into action ripping out the tube and standing up and standing far easier than I had expected. My lycan leg a perfect fit                                                                                        “It’s good to see that you are awake” silver says walking through the door sounding genuinely concerned for my wellbeing.                                                                                     “Where am I?” I ask him certain I have nothing to fear from him                                                                                       “back home. I’m telling you it wasn’t easy to get you here.” He says smiling as if joking with a friend. His eyes though he tries not to keep falling on my leg.                                                                     “ here put these on” he says picking up a bundle of clothes that escaped me before turning around to give me a bit of privacy as I pull on the clothes he gave me. As I do I get a chance to get a better look at what has become my leg. From toes to groin it’s now a lycans leg.                                                                            “What happened to my leg?” I ask him already knowing but if I didn’t ask it would look strange                                                      “I don’t know. When you changed back your leg didn’t. I think I might be because of the damage that wolf done to it so it needed to heal.” He replies still facing the wall as I finish pulling up the pair of black combats he handed me surprised by how comfortable they are                                                                                                        “Why save me? I’m the one that you wanted to get rid of” I continue confused by the change of heart as I pull on the perfectly white t-shirt and light brown leather jacket.                                                                 “We haven’t been trying to get rid of you. We have been trying to help you. We sent alpha and Connor to try and stop them changing you. We sent them to keep you alive, to protect you” he says and I shake my head wildly                                                                 “No. it can’t be...I stood by and watched them…..I helped…..” I scream.                                                                                                              “You were lost, confused and that was our fault. Alpha and Connor knew the risk, knew the danger that they had put themselves in.” he says sadly the news of his death obviously arriving.                                                                                                             “Connor’s alive. I let him go” I protest and silver smiles                                 “I know. He’s the one that told me what happened. He’s also the one that rescued a couple of friends of yours” he says and I look at him shocked.                                                                                         “What? Who? ” I ask feeling terrible I hadn’t thought of my friend till now.                                                                       “They are waiting for you outside. They haven’t moved since we brought you here, sat outside the door refusing to budge till you woke up.” He says and I get the feeling that there is something he isn’t telling me                                                                                   “how long have I been unconscious?” I ask dreading the answer                                “you’ve been here for two weeks Jason. We thought we had lost you a few times. You lost a lot of blood and even healing as fast as you do it was close.” He says and I’m overwhelmed. Two whole weeks of my life gone.                                                                                                                      Opening the door silver waits patiently for me to walk through and I’m just past the door frame when I’m wrapped in the familiar arms of Lucy sobbing into my shoulder and I want to return her hold so much it hurts. Looking over her shoulder I see Luke stood there dark black bags under his eyes.                                            “I thought we had lost you” Lucy sobs over and over again each time breaking into a new set of tears                                                                    “I told you. I’m not going anywhere” I sooth trying to calm the hysterical girl that’s stolen my heart but even as she lets go tears roll down her cheeks.                                                                                “It’s good to see you awake” Luke says the tone of his voice hard but the look on his face and the bags from lack of sleep say a thousand words.                                                                                       “Where’s Emma?” I ask looking at silver who stands behind me                                                                                                “who’s Emma?” he asks confused                                                                        “the baby I had put in the car.” I tell him afraid that they had left the poor child there.                                                                                 “She’s with Connor and Elizabeth. She’s fine” he says and I breathe a sigh of relief.                                                                                          “What’s happened while I’ve been gone?” I ask eager to try and get up to speed on events but as the others exchange uneasy glances I get the feeling that it’s not good.                                                           “Humans and wolven kind are at war. First they took our own island attacking town after town, city after city turning everyone they could, killing those that fought back turning it into their own stronghold. The humans where slow to react first not believing it was real then debating and deciding rather than acting as your brother built an army. It took only a week for them to take the island then they started on the rest. Lycans and werewolves worldwide joined the fight attacking people in the streets believing they were following an Umbrian. Some countries didn’t even bother fighting and just accepted the demands eager to become more powerful.”                                                                                                “And what were the demands?” I ask silver butting in the news shaking me to the core.                                                                          “That everyone would submit themselves to become a lycan or werewolf.” He says and I surprised                                                          “but what does he gain from that?” I ask                                                “everything. Everyone thinks he is the last Umbrian and will follow him blindly.” silver says sounding more intimidated than he would have liked to have let on                                             “So what do we do know? We have to stop them” I declare thinking of all the people that are suffering.                                                     “We can’t stop them. It’s done or will soon be done. They have control of armies, police and media. All hunters have been branded criminals and rewards are on all our heads. They patrol the street looking for anyone human or any of us. We have tried to fight back. We failed.” Silver says dejected, resigning himself to his fate                                                                                            
“We are leaving. There’s one tunnel that they would have missed the one Connor and alpha took to the forest. From there we can run find somewhere to disappear” silver says and I’m outraged.                                                                                                           “You’re going to run away. The world is falling to pieces and you want to bury you head in the sand? Fine but I’m fighting” I declare and for one I see a smile one Luke’s face.                                            “But it’s hopeless. Your brother has an army eager to gain his favour. There is only thirty of us” silver argue refusing to be made feel guilty.                                                                                    You can change people you know. You should build your own pack. The wolf ghosts words echoing in my mind and I realise what he meant. This is what he meant.                                                               “We have thirty Umbrians” I say under my breath and all eyes fall on me.                                                                                                            “You said I’m the last pure Umbrian so if I turn anyone they will be umbrians too” I say and all he can do is nod                                         “then let’s build our own army. It’s time to fight back” I declare                                                                                                “they might not want to.” Silver says still wanting to run                                                                                     “then that’s their decision not mine.” I reply not fussed at his objection.                                                                                                            “Fine then you better come with me then ad tell them the news yourself” he says leading the way towards what is to become my army.                                                                                                          Walking into the room they go from talking and joking to standing in attention waiting for orders from silver but they don’t get them. I break away from the group walking down the troop lined path. As I walk I can feel their eyes on my leg but it doesn’t bother me.                                                                                               “You all know who I am, what I am. You are here because you want to fight back. Defend humanity yes?” I shout to be met with a deafening                                                                                                         “yes sir” their voices hard and powerful full of determination                         “I can help with that. I can make you invulnerable to silver, stronger than any other werewolf or lycan. What do you say do say? You want to become an Umbrian? Do you want to stand at my side and fight back?” I shout and for a moment no one says a word till one man steps out                                                                              “it would be an honour to fight at your side” he says saluting at me in resect.                                                                                                       Slowly more and more of them step forward without a word the action saying it all till every single person has stepped forward ready.                                                                                                             “I will too.” says Luke stepping forward something I hadn’t expected                                                                                                                   “and me” Connor declares and I’m stunned but who am to refuse them.                                                                                                        “What about us?” asks Lucy referring to herself, mum and Emma.                                                                                                                    “Stay here lock yourself in somewhere. We will come and get you when it’s safe” I tell her not leaving any time for questions as I change straight away leaving her to run and find the pair. The clothes silver gave me change with me the long black combats becoming shorts, the sleeves on the jacket disappear its fabric tightens clinging to my body like a second skin. No one move only rolling up their sleeves and holding out there arms ready                                                                                             I go from one to another in quick succession and one by one they fall holding their arms scrunching their eyes in pain as my blood battles with there’s. Even as they see the others fall no one falters determined. When I get to Luke I hesitate and he smiles softly                                                                                                             “do it. For Ryan” he says and I see a glimmer of rage in his eyes as he says his fallen friend’s name. Without warning I drag my claw through his skin and like the rest before him he falls and then there is only one. Connor.                                                         “Bit of a mad journey we have been on hey” he says smiling though his arm is shaking with nerves. I don’t reply with words just nodding before changing him like the rest and for a few minutes all that fills the room is groans, moans and sobs of pain then one by one like caterpillars becoming butterflies they change. Their eyes a darker red than mine and their fur just an iota lighter and as they stand there all thirty two of them growling adjusting to their new found bodies I change back only my leg stays the same the way it will for the rest of my life.
“Do not attack till I say so. With luck they might be smart and realise who I am. Any death that can be avoided is welcome. But if they do fight, if they refuse to stand down then show no mercy” I say voice full of authority and I’m sure they will obey. They are my followers and I am their alpha. I am the alpha.                                                                                              Marching down the hallway towards one of the many exits I lead the way with Luke and Connor just behind me on either side only our footprints and the sound of hundreds of claws on the hard floor grace our ears and as I reach up to open the door I hesitate.                                                                                                            Pressing my ear to the door even through the metal I can hear them on the other side. Two at the sides making small talk. Laughing about some man that had been stupid enough to fight back.                                                                                                                     “What is it Jason?” Luke asks wondering if somethings wrong.                        “Move back” I tell them and they step back a few feet leaving me enough room to move. Pushing the open switch the door opens with a hiss of steam and I can hear the pair on the other side jump to their feet. The door disappears and I don’t move stood there staring down the pair in front of me as they raise their guns.                                                                                                         “ hands behind your head” one shouts a boy, barley an adult trying to sound strong but the tremble in his lip and the sweat rolling down his brow tell me a different story and I don’t move only rattling him further.                                                                                                                                                                                 “ I said hands behind your head!” he shouts again thinking by raising his voice it will make me more compliant but I have no intention of surrender.                                                                                “Look at his leg Chris! He’s some half breed. The alpha will want to see this” the second says and I move my gaze to him and he falls silent.                                                                                              Behind me Luke and Connor start to move forward I slyly signal them to stay there before then fly into action ripping the guns out of the pairs hands and knocking the pairs heads together only knocking them out before waving them forward as I move out the building and into the front garden looking out onto the rest of the estate that was once my home and find a crowd already heading our way maybe a hundred or so armed and fight hungry lycans and werewolves
A vulgar man his stomach peeking out of his far too small filthy top. His hair is long shabby and greasy and as he walks towards me the air fills with the stench of smoke.                                          “What are you? Some half breed?” the man laughs his breath smelling of smoke so terribly it makes me cough.                                           “Are you the alpha of this pack?” I ask him ignoring his jibs but all he does is laugh a deep throaty laugh and jeer                                                 “you been living under a rock for the last few weeks. There is only one alpha. I’m just his humble beta” he laughs the crowd behind him laughing among themselves jeering and giggling like a pack of hyenas.                                                                                        “I’m going to give you this chance. Stand down. Let us leave and we will let you live” I say calmly but firmly and the man smirks his arrogance bigger than his common sense                                      “ you are going to let me live?” he sneers getting right into my face his spit coating my face                                                                           “ maybe I should just kill you now” he sneers and moving quickly he pulls a small silver knife from behind him and swings at my neck expecting it to slice straight through and to see me fall but when the knife hits my skin it doesn’t break the skin. It snaps in two. The blade snapped cleanly at the middle the fracture hitting the floor with a faint ting and everything freezes for a spit second and I hope that it’s enough to prevent a fight. That they will see that fighting will only end in one outcome as everyone else comes into view all armed all ready and panic fills the eyes of the once captures now prisoners. Some lose their courage and flee for the doors. A couple fall to their knees and beg for mercy but more dive in to fight. Human, werewolf and lycans charge at us the beta charging straight for me in werewolf form and all around us fur, claws and fangs fly. And blood. Lots of blood.                                                                                 the beta leaps at me flying through the air and without changing balling my human hand into a fist I punch straight timing it as he just gets into range and beneath my fist I can feel bone and fangs snap under my fist, the obnoxious beta laying in a crumpled heap at my feet.                                                                                     “Who’s next?” I growl the adrenaline rushing to my heart diving into the fight, the fight to begin the war.
