Chapter 1. Those who sell hope
- No, – said with sad Willie’s who had nicknamed Bull, – you’re leading me by the nose buddy. Love doesn’t exist. It’s just gone, but we’ve been so brazenly lied to for thousands of years. And now you’re really lying to me! You’re a cheeky little bastard! Why would you do that?
Bull was being pathetic. He was a dangerous bigwig and no matter how muсh he drank – he always kept his face and didn’t say too much. Bull was rightly considered the most violent and unpredictable companion of the entire crew of the ship “Judy”, which sailed in the treacherous northern waters. Rudolph knew about it. More than, he was witnessing the painful for his susceptibility multiple immoral episodes, which in earlier times before this ill-fated journey did not distort the beautiful picture that illustrated his well-being life, which he inherited from his family. Every day, in the evenings Rudolph was hiding in his tiny stateroom and listening to the sounds and shouting that did not bode well. The owner of the expedition, he was terrified to death of those whose obedience was well paid.
When he was forced face to face with Bull, Rudolph fell into deep despair, assuming the worst outcome of their encounter. In the course of their arduous journey he had every reason to believe that desperation would kill him sooner or later, but as he found out in the aftermath – the all ordeal had taught him a good lesson that he had learned too late. A terrible condition deprived him of his natural senses and reactions, so Rudolph didn’t even notice he sat down with Bull at the same table. Having forgotten the old fear, Rudolph drank the hideous booze with Bull. That was considered the most valuable asset to their team. An accidentally formidable and dangerous bigwig showed Rudolph his true gait. Turns out the formidable Bull is actually simple man Willy – just like everyone else. For the first time Rudolph had forgotten his previous regret and recognized the peculiar benefit of a controversial connection with sailors who resembled pirates rather than ordinary laborers.
- Nobody loves us, – Willie continued, – we don’t love anyone. We don’t love ourselves. We can’t love. We can give away our inability to love as love itself. Lies it’s everywhere. Self-deception is the only feeling we appreciate of all that God has bestowed upon us.
One day I met a woman. She was beautiful, you know. She was gorgeous, so I would have tasted her. But I never should have. So, she told me that she loved, you know, she loved me! For her sake, I gave up the family business, leaving my old father and my brothers without my help. I went whaling. I’ve been working harder than anyone on the team since the first big-water run. I’ve endured the contempt of the ship’s mold – of the people whose glorious times were left in the distant past. I’ve known no rest. I’ve put up with a lot. I’ve thought – I would find it, I would take it, I would get it! I dreamed that she would be happy with me, knowing that she would have no need for anything. Yeah, that’s the thing.
- Wasn’t that enough for her? – Rudolph asked.
Willie responded with irritation:
- No. She said she couldn’t love me – a killer of creatures more intelligent than myself. Can you believe it?! There are no such women, but I have found this one on my head! So, where is the love that makes you so nervous?! I was willing to give my life for it. I was such a fool!
- That means you loved her.
- I didn’t! I was wrong! My choices cost me too much. Without me and my help, my father’s and brothers’ affairs soon went underground. First on lending and then on the big water. Well, the whipped beauty woman killed four lives.
- What was her name? – Rudolph asked. He was curious for reasons he couldn’t understand.
- Judy.
- That explains everything. Now I agree – you really didn’t love her.
- I didn’t! I was wrong! On the first and last time!
Willie fell to the floor as soon as he was finished. Without changing his habit, he fell asleep quietly, probably going on another date with the unloved Judy, who had settled in his heart, soul and colorful dreams, where everything worked out for him in the most beautiful way.
Rudolph began to think about what the formidable bigwig with a small broken heart had told him. But still had no response in Rudolph’s soul to the pretentious suggestion of an eternal sailor who, in his lifetime, had been stranded on land at the same time, when he fed on his mother’s milk. At one time, Rudolph gave his word that he would never lie again, rejecting what was uncomfortable or scary to accept.
For a brief moment, Rudolph turned into Rudy. He remembered the woman he loved. Rudy held in awe the memory of everything about her. Every day of this strange expedition, he would scroll through one of their last conversations in his head.
“When this is over, we will sail to the northern lands of Laldiroff and make a great journey to my dream. Yeah, first my dream comes true, and then yours. It’s fair, Rudy. I deserve it.
Now I’m here with you, but I’m so excited to be there. I want to hear the voice of the Earth. I want to be away from this nightmare. To wait is unbearable. Stay here – like a slow and painful death. It’s better to wander there in unfriendly colder than here in hypocritical heat”.
- She lied, – Willie pronounced slowly.
- Who? – Rudolph asked anxiously.
 - A woman. My woman, damn her! And you, fool, are running around with that stupid vase. You’ve spent too much money for stupid love.
- It’s not a vase! It’s an urn, – Rudolph severely corrected Willie’s rudeness, – and it’s my money! Do you care what you get unjustifiably overpaid for?!
Willie, who everyone called the Bull, had a weak sense of quilt, almost for the first time in his life.
- What happened to her? – Willie asked, as he continued to lie on the floor.
- She was killed.
- Your stories are still so much happier than mine. She didn’t tell you there were smarter things than you and she didn’t lie when she told you she loved you. I guess. You’re a lucky man, buddy.
- I’m jealous of myself, – said Rudolph in a sad way, and then he rushed away.
When Rudolph entered his stateroom, he carefully obscured what he had to do in order to do this crazy thing. The urn, in which the ashes of his beloved Aurora were kept, aroused in him feelings of love, bitterness and even dependence, and at the crew of the ship “Judy” – snide ridicule.
All this way was for her. Rudolph didn’t regret all what he had to have Aurora’s ashes scattered in the North. She was to remain forever in the lands of Laldiroff, where the true voice of the Earth would sing the saddest song in the world and mourning the Aurora’s death.
 Now love brought Rudolph unbearable suffering, but yet he has not given up on it, as Willie and the man from his old life, whom Rudy despised more than anyone else. Love killed Rudy. He died with Aurora on May 26, 1994.
None of the team “Judy” even suspected that it fell on the part of the person, over whom they made such a dirty mockery. If they knew the truth, anything would have changed. They had no idea of any other life, and there would be no place for them in either life. They were unaware that somewhere in the vicinity could kill someone who was smarter than the strongest. That if one person tries to do something that is truly important to millions, they will surely be sentenced – most often to death. That’s when millions suffer in the interest of one person, such person becomes more and more powerful. The members of the team “Judy” were happy in their ignorance.
Chapter 2. Those who betray hope
- Wake up, Commander! – Rat screamed disgusting.
He was, as always drunk and intolerant, but even this vile man had never invaded Rudolph’s stateroom so early and so brazenly.
- What happened?! – Rudolph asked was afraid.
- Bull is calling you to have a serious conversation as soon as possible. Hurry! It’s you who need it, not us.
The first thing Rudolph thought of at the time caused him happiness and fear at the same time. They were supposed to have arrived at the target. “Turns out it wasn’t a long way to go. The insolent snouts clearly exaggerated the price of their services, but fuck them! Finally, I’m sick of it!”, – he talked in his mind. But then he went into shock. From the moment of the decision and for all days from the beginning of the course of the ship “Judy” on northern waters, he never once thought about what will do once he finds himself in the lands of Laldiroff. His arrangements with the team “Judy” were highly questionable, and only now he realized that his extraordinary desire was too limited by simple human circumstances. Yet he was able to do something he had never been able to do before.
The uneasy joy did not last long. When Rudolph approached with Bull, he looked around. A familiar image was revealed – there was still an ocean around the ship. There were the same cold, same color, same smell and the same sounds. But what was most unpleasant was not the uniformity of the surrounding space, which meant the demise of little hope. The same evil Bull stood before him again. It was impossible to recognize the old vulnerable Willie, with whom he could talk to properly.
- Look over there, – reluctantly said Bull.
He was pointing forward, where everything remained the same. His hand was shaking from a hangover, but he was sure he was right and showing proud of himself.
- There’s the lands of Laldiroff’s is, – he claimed.
- I only see the ocean and the horizon.
- That’s right, but beyond the horizon are the lands of Laldiroff. We’ve done our job. So, we’re going back in two hours.
- No, – Rudolph screamed, – that wasn’t the deal!
- We agreed that I would show you where Laldiroff’s lands were, provide my vessel, assemble a team, and we would take the proper route. I did everything I could.
- But we didn’t get there!
- My baby “Judy” can’t get to where you’re so foolish to go. We’ve already gone too far. The danger is below us and around us. Your whim is too expensive. Even I won’t take that much. So go get your pitcher and throw it overboard. What does she care? She's dead. She doesn’t care about that. Don’t bury us too early.
- You lied to me!
- Yes, I did. And I do it again. I’ve always lied to, I'm lying now, and I'll lie ever, without exception. With great pleasure I lie to myself when I have to. All respectable people lie. You could have fooled me first. You missed a successful opportunity, buddy.
- Stop it!
The desperate situation drove Rudolph mad. He could no longer contain himself. His body started to spontaneously twitch, and his behavior was like a childhood tantrum.
- Look buddy, you’ll be showing this shame sitting on your daddy’s lap, – Bull maliciously taunted for him, – not everything in this life is gonna be what you want. Your dad’s not that rich. Calm down and get to work!
Rudolph insisted on his interests. He was willing to resort to extreme measures to get the result he wanted.
- I’m not gonna let this go! It will be the last trip of your baby “Judy”! You’ll regret your mistake when you lose everything! You won’t get a dime from me, and whatever little you’ve managed to collect for yourself, through deceit, blackmail and manipulation, you’ll be taken away by those who work for my father! The money you spent, you’ll have to work it out on my terms! Only on my terms!
Bull listened to the threats calmly and confidently, but something was clearly bothering him, because he did not kill his opponent with a snide ridicule. Rudolph’s threats were strong and meaningful. Bull was well aware that the “weakling” is capable of a lot if he has the necessary intention and influential father. But people like Bull don’t give up. Rudolph was provoking him without realizing the risks to himself. Only after Bull hit him on the head, Rudolph did realize that during the one-sided conflict he was extremely reckless. The insight was short-lived. Bull’s heavy hand knocked out his an already fragile consciousness.
When he woke up, he couldn’t believe his eyes. Bull, Rat and the whole “Judy” team were not there. The banditry ship has disappeared beyond visible limits. They threw the defeated Rudolph on a big drifting ice sheet. Apparently, with a sense of compassion, they left behind his belongings and a few servings of surströmming. Bull knew that there was nothing worse than starving death, and from himself gave, as he thought, everything necessary for a “liquid father’s nozzle” to avoid this.
Upon realizing his position, Rudolph began to throw aside everything that lay carelessly in one pile. Before he died, he had to find the main thing among the unnecessary. Luckily for him, the urn was found. Condemned to die, he had no choice but to admit that very soon he would join his sweet Aurora and together they would find eternal rest somewhere near the lands of Laldiroff.
Rudy lay with the urn pressed against his chest. He hid under the cover of things until recently valuable to him and tried to sleep. He hoped he would never wake up again. The dream was close, but the hateful memories kept him awake.
In his thoughts, he turned to the image of the woman he loved:
“They killed you. They took away your happiness, but I couldn’t let them take away your dreams. I’m so sorry I didn’t do it in time. All my ideas of life turned out to be false. Now I understand you. I’m sorry it’s so late”.
It seemed to him that the image of Aurora came out of his dreams and formed next to him in reality. He saw her in a dark silhouette. She leaned over his body, which was frozen by the cold and mortal fear. He heard her quiet voice and felt the gentle touch he missed. She magically helped him sleep.
Chapter 3. The penultimate drop
In the dark of the night, wake up
Wake up and save only those
Whose souls fight for life
Against themselves.

Clear the sky for the stars
Great and Small.
For those whose path is closed,
Give them the light of the moon.
Their world will be found immediately
A world of great memories.
When you get there, everyone who’s forgotten will triumph.
I’ll be right there. A slave of the little dreams.
Aurora seemed so real and close. Torn between two conditions, Rudy doubted where the truth was. The desired condition was the emerging of Aurora. He almost believed that her death and his dreadful journey to the North was the most elaborate and prolonged nightmare to come to an end. But time exposes all illusions, not by giving the truth, but by changing the attitude to lie. One second could bring down years of creation, much less a modest handful of unreasonable hopes. The real condition proved to him the true extent of his position by the only uncontested fact – nothing changed.
Her voice gradually faded, the black silhouette disappeared into darkness. The sense of endless fall that drove Rudy crazy was suddenly replaced by a distinct feeling of a sturdy surface, enormously cold and unpleasant in his body. With Aurora gone a beautiful lie, taking the rest of his pure mind.
When Rudy dared to open his eyes to a new reality, in the first moments he had to withstand the painful onslaught of light. Having come to terms with the new conditions of the vision, he began to consider what his cruel fate had given him last.
The first thing he saw was a big black stain. From there, the silhouettes of unusually tall and strangely dressed people would bounce off and creep apart. Their faces coming out of the shadows seemed exactly identical. Strangers were in charge of his belongings. They looked closely at everything they found and many of the things they had in their hands  savages threw it aside like garbage. Rudy was still not aware of what was going on in front of his eyes and what further trouble he could expect in the future. One of them noticed Rudy watching their actions, but still kept going through things. He was the one who found the urn. Proud of himself, he gladly gave the urn to another man to whom he had unreservedly obeyed.
Rudy tried to scream as hard as he could:
- Don’t touch! This thing has no value to all of you! Leave it!
Then he reasonable to assume that the northern aborigines did not understand him, because they knew and spoke only in their language. He wanted to attack the giants with a fight, but he had no strength even to move. His body was tightly frozen.
- The valuable to us is what’s inside this vessel, – said stranger in whose hands the urn was.
Rudy was stunned.
- Do you understand my speech?
- We all speak the same language if that’s necessary. Don’t confuse us with savages, one of whom is yourself. We are the children of the Great Spirit Aliel. All of us are Aliel. We’re aware of the past, the present and what is destined would be – all the possible and certain variations that are certain to emerge in the future for irreversible events and processes.
- That means nothing to me.
- Don’t dare you be no disrespect to Gallagud! – angrily said the harshest of strangers.
Intending to defend the great honor of their leader, the one who was the toughest of them grabbed Rudy by the breasts and stared into his eyes – eyes of the victim he had captured. He did not take any action, however, apparently eagerly awaited to Gallagud’s instructions. In all his nature, he showed a determined will to beat the meagre remnants of life out of Rudy. He was the angriest of the most evil people Rudy had ever encountered in his life, with the meanest eyes and obviously the worst intentions. In a quick comparison, which he could afford, Bull and the murky crew of the ship “Judy” seemed to be the most kind and responsive representatives of the northern latitudes. He saw no other way but to surrender to the apparently great strength and allow the most evil man to beat out of him the really meagre remains of life that he encroached upon so willingly. Seeing the weakness and humility of his victim, the evil man angrily shaken Rudy, apparently angry that the weak and doomed creature had no intention of resisting him in any way.
- Leave the poor man, Vuggo, – Gallagud ordered, – we’re not mad at him.
Vuggo did not dare to disobey Gallagud, although he did not understand or accept Gallagud’s stance. The evil man released Rudy and join with his own – probably the same ruthless barbarians who, fortunately, did not care about Rudy. But Gallagud was staying, and it hardly boded well. Leaning over Rudy, he said:
- We’re leaving you. Thank you for your loyalty to the mission with which you came to our lands. You must wait for a little bit. Aliel will reward your patience. Death will be your joy. You’ve come a long and hard way. It wasn’t all for nothing. Your gift is priceless. We’ve been waiting for this for hundreds of years.
- What for?
- You don’t need to know.
Gallagud left him. The strangers went to their saving clothes. These were huge domes wrapped in the skins of wild, unknown animals. Clothed in these cumbersome constructions, strangers hid themselves from the dangers of the North. All they had outside was their heads coming out from above. These strange and funny garments were their hallmark among the peoples of Laldiroff, a reliable defense against the cold and attacks of an enemy they had never met, their only personal possessions and home.
Gallagud solemnly carried Rudy’s priceless gift. Next to him was the man who found the urn. He was to be rewarded for finding it, and he gained a new status in their sacred society – his word became powerful. Now he could say everything and always be heard.
For the first time, using his right, he asked Gallagud:
- Why did we leave him to die?
- He’s almost no life left in him. He belongs to death, – said Gallagud.
- I saw in his eyes the shine that no dying man has.
- You made a mistake, Ulligrassor.
Sensing the prospect of new opportunities, Ulligrassor decided to protest, not doubting his own beliefs.
- What happens in the future if I’m not wrong now? He’s the missionary who gave us this great gift that he held dear. By throwing him to death, we have desecrated the gift we need in our path to happiness. We have proven by our vile deed that we are not worthy of return.
- Aliel will decide that, – Gallagud said with angered, clearly regretting that Ulligrassor had gained the power of his own word.
The rest of the extraordinary group followed and listening attentively to an unpleasant conversation. All of them, especially Vuggo, supported Gallagud and were very angry at Ulligrassor. This did not mean that they supported Gallagud. They needed time to get used to Ulligrassor’s opinions, as well as anything he might have said in the future. They understood that both Gallagud and Ulligrassor were equally right, and this became a serious obstacle at the very beginning of their solemn journey. Their conflicting truths kept them from moving forward.
- Aliel has to decide his fate right now, – suggested Ulligrassor.
- It’s impossible! – said Vuggo.
- Don’t force us to live and act in the constraints you make up, Vuggo! – said Silgur, who was considered the wisest among them, – Ulligrassor is right. We have determined the fate of this savage, although it is only Aliel who makes such decisions in the lands of Laldiroff.
- We are Aliel! – said Vuggo.
- Don’t say anything you’ll soon regret Vuggo, – said Muniard, the one who found compromise even where there was no compromise, – we’re only the children of Aliel. Are you ready to claim the power and authority of our Father? 
Feeling the strength of the resistance of the worthy opponents, Vuggo attempted to slow down his usual uncontrollable rage. He could not compete with the wisdom and knowledge of Silgur and Muniard. However hard Vuggo tried, natural rage was stronger than true awareness.
- Like the faithful son of Aliel, I carry his will! My wish is his wish!
- I’m sorry, Vuggo, but you’re the stupidest kid of Aliel, – wise Silgur ruthlessly attacked the pride of Vuggo, – don’t piss him off! Now we’re in the vicinity of a place where everything can be done. I’m prepared to take the savage there and bring him before the Father.
- We all go there, – decided Gallagud.
The upcoming case required a clear separation. Five of them left their cumbersome clothes. The domes restricted their movements and actions. Vuggo and Slargart went to the nearest areas where the beasts lived. Gallagud, Wurn, Migurnock and Raron took on the load of the other domes and went to the place of Aliel, while Ulligrassor, Silgur and Muniard returned to take Rudy back.
- Let me talk to him, – said Ulligrassor to others.
Silgur silently stopped Muniard and nodded positively.
Rudy was still awake. He needed warmth and healing. Ulligrassor sat beside him. His good-natured gaze and pleasant smile gave Rudy a sense of trust that was more desperate than honest.
- Tell me your name, – asked Ulligrassor.
- Rudolph... Rudy... just Rudy.
- I came for you.
- Who are you?
- Ulligrassor. You’re my friend. Don’t be afraid of me.
- Where I come from, people don’t make friends that fast, – said Rudy in fear.
- As long as you’re here, I’m your friend and you will be my friend.
- As long as I’m here...
- Forgive us, Rudy. We’re very tired. Until this day, we had wandered, without leaving the limits of endless suffering. Warriors of truth. Guards of eternal knowledge. Wanderers in empty. It’s really hard for us. I haven’t slept since everything was fine. I guess I never slept.
- We could all use a rest.
- Not now. Silgur and Muniard will take you to our Father.
- Why? I’m dying...
- It’s not for us to determine when and how you’re death. It’s the right of Aliel.
- He’s fair, – said Muniard.
- And he’s mercifully, if it is his will, – said Silgur.
- Let him decide, – said Rudy with maid his peace.

In the middle of enigmatic journey, the dusk dissolved their images in Laldiroff’s Grey Wasteland. One of the mysteries of this place was that no living thing that came into the Grey Wasteland could rely on its own senses. The thick gray dusk made it hard to see, the stagnant air blocked the sense of smell, and the cold eliminated all other senses. No matter how sharp the natural instinct, it was instantly lost, as if it had never existed.
Silgur and Muniard walked with confidence, as if there were no and could not be obstacles for them. They have carried Rudy as a defeated enemy or captured prey. Muniard, and especially Silgur, treated Rudy with great respect, but the kindest and most merciful of them seemed to be Ulligrassor. He followed them, just as fearlessly and confidently.
- What will happen to me? – Rudy asked.
- You will pass the ordeal of the penultimate drop, – answered Muniard.
- This is the Great Act, – said Silgur.
- I’m too weak to ordeals, – Rudy objected.
- It is this ordeal that will give you what you need. As an ordinary savage, you do not know your true need, depriving yourself of the opportunity to find the right path to follow, – said Ulligrassor.
- The penultimate drop will give you a new strength and joy of life, or a quiet death, – Silgur explained.
- An ordinary drop of water will give me a verdict?
- The drop after the drop fills us with life and power, – said Muniard.
- The drop after the drop deprives us of our strength and our lives, – said Silgur.
- The drop measures the limits of our internal resources, patience, capabilities, – said Ulligrassor.
- The all of living things consider the last drop is the most frightening, – said Silgur, – the last drop of water tells us of an impending thirst, sometimes deadly, and only when thirst becomes a real threat does it reveal the extent of the true stupidity, because the living thing has done nothing to prevent it. It didn’t save its source, it wasn’t looking for a new one. It was adapting. It trusted its future with something it didn’t know. It is a frightening but short realization, for few accept their mistakes in the prime of life, and especially when death approaches.
The last drop of water will not put out the fire, which could become the threat of a terrible fire that ignites everything in its path. It’s the fate of wild people. Fire appears with your hands. Because of your actions, destruction triumphs. But without the help of nature and what is not created by you, you will not be able to create new things, or to fight the destruction that grows with the help of others like you. But you won’t always have that help. Sometimes nature gives in to your destruction and doesn’t allow you to prevent it so you can only get what you’ve arranged for yourself. Nature knowingly carries the eternal sacrifice, but that doesn’t mean it can’t punish.
The last drop of patience destroys a man’s personal power over his own life and all that happens in it. Those who are no longer able to cope with themselves go far beyond the limits of patience. There’s not a lot of people that can go back out of there. There’s only one path of endless regret left. Each one takes its own sending. Some regret that they faced an insurmountable barrier. Some regret the connection with the people involved in their suffering. Some people regret having spent all their energy on patience. There are a lot of options that don’t have the truth. And who honestly needs the truth?
The last drop is believed to be the executioner. Everyone knows, but almost no one has acknowledged that the last drop brings divine relief from the tortuous tension left by her predecessors. The last drop gives certainty about what’s about to happen. It gives freedom, which is important to be able to make good use of it. It’s all predetermined by fate, but it’s been converted to mislead by a man.
- Aliel told us the great power of the penultimate drop, – Muniard continued, – at the moment when it when the turn of the penultimate drop, a fateful decision will make as to what would happen. The final drop is a guide to the inevitable.
- I don’t understand nothing, – said Rudy.
- The penultimate drop sharpens to the limit the feelings of fear, despair, helplessness. It’s unbearable. It’s got all the weight of what we’ve been through before: everything that seemed light and simple, but actually shattered the fragile nature of the creature. But no one knows is that behind that drop is falling the last drop, that brings relief. Everyone who suffers from the torture of horror, thinks about how long it will take to wait, to endure, to be humbled. The penultimate drop leaves no choice to the person. This moment determines what is going to happen and whether anything will happen.
- I don't want that, – resisted Rudy.
- It doesn’t require your wish, – replied Silgur.

The rest of the way to Aliel’s space they passed without saying a word. Too much had been said before. “Better I’d known nothing”, – thought Rudy, fearing of own fantasies after the stories of Silgur and Muniard. Ulligrassor saw the Rudy’s suffering caused by fear of the unknown, but could not figure out how he could help him, so he left everything as it was, pretending not to notice nothing.
Having overcome the Grey Wasteland, and then a series of difficult climbs and steep downhill rides on the Weeping Slopes, the giants stopped. Obviously, they needed to replenish their powers for something of great importance. The sudden change that stopped them from moving rapidly towards their target alarmed Rudy, who did not know that their journey was coming to an end. The domes have already been seen far away. “It’s had better not be the end... or... it had better be the end”, – Rudy was finally confused.
Gallagud and Wurn slowly prepared for the sacred action. Migurnock mixed his secret potions, creating a drink that was meant for Rudy. During the waiting period, he managed to blend some extracts for personal use, despite the prohibition of Gallagud.
Gallagud always scolded Migurnock for creating a potion that puts the mind to sleep. The temptation to merge at least briefly with the emptiness in which the beautiful oblivion appeared, master all of them except Raron and Vuggo, who despised Migurnock for this opportunity and himself for the weakness, because several times he too would go off to places from where he did not want to return. Gallagud was angry and begged from supreme forces to punishment Migurnock, as he was forced to compete for influence with short illusions causing an insurmountable dependency. But this time Gallagud gifted him his forgiveness. The common interests forced them to reconcile. Migurnock tried as never before. The joy of the long-awaited find inspired him to create a black, like a tar, drink which had extraordinary properties. Inside himself, he regretted that he couldn’t tasted try something he was so proud of.
Raron sat by a melting glacier and as always kept silent. He never spoke or listened. That was his natural state.
Vuggo and Slargart being the last who came to Aliel’s space. Vuggo brought on his mighty shoulders the carcass of the beautiful deer he had slain. It was one of the strongest animals of those lands. Without this victim, the ordeal of the penultimate drop was impossible.
Everything was ready for sacral action. Vuggo daringly dropped the deer carcass near a small melting glacier. Silgur carefully placed Rudy on the carcass. The others chose special places for themselves and sat around the altar, preparing their drums.
By creating the sounds of the drums, they revived their thoughts and called for help from the heavens. Therefore, they left the present for escape to the peaceful. The sacral peace kept their essence out of life and death for as long as Aliel allowed. The Great Father did not indulge them, but did not let them resent him for his inexorable rigour.
Rudy’s position surpassed the worst of his fantasies: the carcass of the dead deer was impatiently stink, the drops of which Silgur, Muniard and Ulligrassor spoke, was dripped to his forehead – cold, sharp and painful like spears, in the back of his head and spine there he was feeling disturbing wandering of heat coming out of the carcass. The kind Ulligrassor, along with the other evil giants, watched with silence and without remorse or compassion for Rudy’s anguish. Their indifference drove Rudy mad, but he was wrong to think that the process under way is absolutely clear to him. At the right time, Migurnock gave him that extraordinary salty drink. After third sip, Rudy was feeling a frightening numbness, first in the tongue and then throughout the body. Finally losing control of himself, he literally believed and felt himself being transformed into a handful of ashes, which a cold and ruthless wind was about to sweep across the North.
All of a sudden, giants began to beat their drums. Each of them had its own rhythm, and their drums had fascinating and unique voices.
Ulligrassor sounded swift and abrupt.
Muniard’s had a calm rhythm and a quiet sound.
Vuggo beat ruthlessly and ferociously.
Slargart beat like Vuggo, but did it half-heartedly.
Silgur struck quietly twice, followed by one loud punch, followed by a pause, followed by another silent and two very loud punches.
Migurnock beat measured and indeterminate, but his drum sounded the most beautiful.
Wurn was producing the most complex, previously unknown hearing rhythm, truly confusing consciousness. His drum’s voice was the lowest and deepest. Rudy’s heart sometimes stopped when Wurn beating.
Gallagud beat to his drum immediately after Raron struck.
Raron beat the drum as soon as a drops was fells on Rudy’s forehead. These were the loudest blows of all. Raron and his drum brought Rudy indescribable flour that was far superior to the suffering caused by the drops, the stench and the unpleasant heat.
In a moment, what was thought to be immutable collapsed. Thoughts as though the constructions of the matches were broken, scattered, ignited, thus destroying the meaning that could not have been. Rudy was horrified by the loss of control over his own mind. It was an internal rebellion against himself. Raron caused Rudy’s madness. From the first blows, his drum drove out Rudy’s sanity.
The peak of torment was fast approaching and was about to be finally destroy Rudy, when suddenly, on the eve of the long-suffering end, apparently after falling of penultimate drop, Rudy fell into a crushing darkness. According to conventional wisdom, it was death itself.
The darkness was not infinite. Unwittingly escaping death, Rudy woke up surrounded by a blinding light. This light was unbearable, terrible and hated by him. Rudy lay in a small, seemingly empty room, but the most important thing was that once he swore never to forget everything that’s ever happened in this room.
He was looking at the white ceiling, and then something terrible made his desperately searching for what was needed. The bright green bowl was a basic necessity and a symbol of defeat. The mockery of fate has never been more cruel: for a man of well-being and power, the usual cheap bowl has turned out to be the most faithful companion of the miserable rest of life.
The perpetual nausea was the merciless outcome of everything that had been lived and how it had been. It happened for some reason. Attempts to find the cause of defeat didn’t make sense. It is not difficult to find a plethora of reasons and grounds, but with their continued emergence there will be no firm and unequivocal, single and irrefutable proof that one of them is the right reason. Accepting defeat, the broken man realizes that everything but this nausea was an unstable and meaningless convention. And only a bright green bowl will remain the last undeniable value. For a while, it will contain the remains of the inner world of the one to whom it belongs. In the hideous glow of white walls and ceilings, a bright green color over and over will give a tiny hope for an unjustly short moment of relief.
Rudy recognised this room. He also remembered the bowl, which was he held in his arms more than once. However, in his memory, the symbol of that terrible time was a bowl of yellow colour – not so beautiful and not so small.
The terrifying darkness drove him through his childhood. Everything that happened to him now, many years ago happened to his mother. It was a place where she lived out her days in agony. The last time he saw her was two weeks before she died. Then she asked him to come closer and stand by the window for a while so she could see him. Rudy couldn’t forget those creepy eyes. She was never like that. It seemed like Rudy wasn’t that important to her anymore, and she wasn’t that fond of him at all. He couldn’t shake that grievance. The unconscious feeling of loss forced him to defend himself in his own way. He didn’t hear from mother for the next two weeks and did not ask any question about her in principle, but Rudy remembered that a bright green bowl appeared on the day she died.
The pain of loss that had held Rudy by the throat for decades blended with his mother’s physical pain. Nothing like this, to his fortunately, he’s never experienced before. Rudy waited for the last drop of patience to finally fall, followed by a well-deserved release from suffering. The situation he was against his will was unbearable and literally drove him mad. The pain in his body didn’t get any worse, but with every second, the anguish of patience killed everything he had left, starting with hope. And once his limitations were defeated, Rudy fell into the darkness of relief.
Freeing from the mother’s pain that became part of his life was not the end of Rudy’s ordeal. The rule of forces threw him into the epicenter of a big celebration he missed not so long ago. He was faced with joyful faces rising from the darkness to meet him. There was an atmosphere of admiration around – many, if not all, were languishing in anticipation of the long-awaited event. Space was shaken by hundreds of voices and camera clicks. The flashes, one brighter than the other, created the cosmic sensation of stellar flickering on the way to triumph. He felt free, but only the feeling of something nice tickled his nerves. And when “glorious” moment was already close, a flash blind his eyes, followed by a burning pain rapidly spread all over his back. Then came the darkness again.
The outbreak, and he regained consciousness. Rudy couldn’t do anything but watch the doctors alarmingly fussing over him. They fought for his life in the only decrepit ambulance in the city. This episode was shown a couple of times on TV. The flash, and he was back in the dark, but he didn’t get any better. The pain was completely different.
There was a once again flare, and everything was propelled around. The decrepit ambulance exploded on its way to the clinic. The flare, and the darkness came again. It was the darkness of liberation.
The voice of the beloved Aurora lured him out of the darkness. She bowed above him, holding his left hand.
- I’m feeling so bad, – quietly said Rudy, – very bad. I can’t stand it anymore.
Aurora said to him:
- Leave your patience here. It’s the only and last your trouble.
- That’s not the problem, – objected Rudy.
- You’re right, son. The trouble is completely different, – said his mother, who he didn’t notice right away.
She stood aside. Coming closer, his mother quietly leaned over him and took his right hand.
There was a benevolent silence around. The northern aborigines, who had given Rudy unbearable torment, disappeared. He was lying on the cold soil alone and he was being so far from home. Despite everything, Rudy felt his happiness.
- Give me your pain, – said Aurora.
- Give me your sorrow, – said his mother.
Aurora and his mother hugged him tightly, and then lifted his weakened body and carried him over the White Hill, where a deep hole had already been dug for him. After carefully putting Rudy in the place he’s supposed to be, Aurora and his mother rose up, turning into two huge dark figures, covering him from the outside world.
- We will save you, Rudy. You will be hidden here forever, and only we will know where to find you. I will always be there for you, just like your mother. The two of us will guard your peace. Let us have it.
A handful behind a handful, they threw the earth at him. Rudy couldn’t and didn’t want to resist. Looking at his mother and Aurora, he remembered all his dreams of them. The ordeal of penultimate drop led him to find what Rudy wanted so badly.
Fulfillment of desire, according to unwritten rules does not guarantee satisfaction of the willing. Rudy was depressed by the understanding that women he loves would be there for him, but he would never be able to see them again. In that brief encounter, he saw his mother. He was lucky enough to feel close to her. Her facial features, her voice and her warmth, after years without her, Rudy couldn’t retain in his memory. Instead, he held a very grudge, believing that at the end of his life, she had abandoned it. Having met her again, he didn’t want to let go of what he saw and felt.
As they promised, mother and Aurora hid Rudy in unknown location. The protection and patronage of the two main women of his life were his last precious gain. While devoting himself entirely to the mysterious process, Rudy did not contemplate the most important point that should never be forgotten. Waiting, whether it is real life or a sweet dream, gives no guarantees. Even in the dream space, Rudy began to suffocate from deep underground. Neither mother nor Aurora warned him that they had put him in a death trap.
Shackled by the cold grip of his own grave, Rudy again took the terrible agony that seemed to him the last. This time, it was he who dying. Ironically, since childhood, Rudy was afraid of suffocation. Another of his phobias’s exuberance arose when he choked on a huge piece of peach he didn’t want to share with his nanny. At least, then he had the hope that it would be beaten out of him and he would continue his idle life. There was always a life-saving hand to pull him out of critical situations. Rudy had all the necessities of an idle life for the rest of his days, but at one point, he gave it all up for a fatal adventure. In the fateful hour, there was no saving hand, but there were saving horns.
The cold ground over Rudy began to shake. Something huge and aggressive was stubbornly digging up a fresh embankment. Before he knew it, Rudy rose off the ground and was high above it. He was taken from his grave by the sacrificial deer, that was killed by the evil Vuggo. Aurora and his mother were no longer there. They disappeared without keeping their promise.
Half-dead and completely distraught Rudy hung on the giant horns. The Savior Deer carried him towards the giant glacier. There, rising higher and higher on the peak of the majestic Rotkrugting, the deer burst into the extraordinary northern lights. For the first time, Rudy saw an indescribable beauty. The green mist seemed so close that if he could move, he could reach out and touch the real miracle.
At the top, when there was only one more leap to the northern lights, in a dark place, where the sound of the icy wind cried out for someone who could hear it, the deer threw Rudy off a cliff into a black abyss. Down there, he was going to die, but Rudy didn’t care. He was in a state of primordial relief, the power of which the chosen ones know.
It was in that instant that he solved the mystery of the penultimate drop. Only someone who had experienced such a thing knew – the all worthless. The powerless man, he was following through life, guided by what drove him into a deadly trap. Absolutely all of his knowledge and memories had no meaning. The meaning of anything is the greatest illusion of man, tormenting him for nothing. The free fall gave the happiest feeling of inner purity and lightness.
Time stood still. Rudy’s inner voice was gone. He was ready to die and accepted it with gratitude. Death’s hands seemed to accept him – he felt her touch of his body. It was someone’s help, someone’s safe embrace. Thinking it was over, Rudy was looking forward to the coming.
He was not let to enjoy his leaving. The earth shook wildly, waking Rudy from a sweet dream. When he opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was a silver light. There was an extraordinary picture before him. The dark silhouettes, framed by shining lights, surrounded him and rushed from right to left, causing something obscure, yet absolutely fascinating. The shadows of the little people were in a powerful ecstasy, twitching at the pleasure. Rudy initially did not understand the meaning of what was happening, but almost immediately remembered that there was no meaning.
Suddenly, a wild dance stopped a scary voice, who greeting Rudy. The dark silhouettes froze in worship.
- What do you think my power is? – scary voice asked.
Without doubt that the question was addressed to him, Rudy answered:
- At nothing.
Upon hearing this, the dark silhouettes rushed on Rudy, tearing him apart. Merging into a great darkness, they absorbed him completely. When the last ray of light faded in a hopeless darkness, Rudy was ending up at the place where it all began.
The sacrificial deer beneath it has long cooled and rigor. Gallagud, Vuggo, Ulligrassor, Silgur, Migurnock, Slargart, Wurn, Muniard and Raron no longer played their drums. The own dome, which the evil Vuggo had been working hard on, was already ready for Rudy. Migurnock prepared him a new drink with the healing properties of instant action. Ulligrassor sat next to Rudy. Raron went aside, away from everyone. The rest of them were sitting around the fire and having a mysterious conversation.
When Rudy’s life force began to return, Gallagud asked everyone to leave the two of them alone. He was harsh, but Rudy felt that Gallagud was not angry with him.
- We are on our way home, – announced Gallagud, – for many months we will have to roam the sacred lands of Laldiroff in search of guidelines that will show us where we have to move on. You are an outsider, and you are not aware that Laldiroff has no one or nothing standing still. Our home has long been gone from where it used to be. There are challenges ahead of us, because we are not alone here, but we are the only children of Aliel. This path will seem eternal.
- Will you leave me? – asked Rudy.
- You are free. We will leave you if that is your wish. Aliel has accepted you and we must accept you, however hard this may be for poor Vuggo. The ordeal of the penultimate drop proved that you can get to the end. Today, we’re going on a great and hard trip, and you can come with us. Our home – your home, too.
- If I go with all of you, my family will not wait for me.
- You can’t wait for someone who’s not waiting you.
Chapter 4. The first journey
Their journey, as Gallagud warned, was terribly long. The wanderers did not move, calmly waiting for two of them, Vuggo’s and Slargart’s, to find the right direction. The two giants performed impeccably their mission as keepers and guides. They courageously walked through the darkness, the northern mirages, and the traps, to avoid the slightest danger to others. In practice, animal instincts allowed them to find lost or far-shifted roads. When they found the landmark, they immediately shared their further duties. Slargart went to his brothers to lead them. The wanderers and Rudy followed him and step out of the darkness, the northern mirages and traps. Vuggo was remained in the new place and waiting the others. Thanks to him, they have had a small temporary camp, where the weary wanderers after an exhausting transition could find their healing peace and warmth. The warmth of the fire was a sacred value to them. Anticipating requests of his brothers, the only one hunter, Vuggo, had secured eating for everyone. The stocks he had saved would be have sufficed until the next stop. Despite his fearsome and aggressive temper, it was Vuggo who took care of all the wanderers, giving them protection, shelter, warmth, food and giving them hope that their journey to the house with each new stop became shorter and shorter.
Slargart’s return sometimes took weeks. The wanderers tried to stick together, but each was free to spend their time in their own way. Migurnock lay far away from everyone, resting still and devouring his magical drink. Silgur and Muniard told each other everything they knew about events outside Laldiroff. Sometimes, from their lips there were terrible, unjust, monstrous in their details stories, but neither Silgur nor Muniard shared the horror and anxiety of Rudy, who tried to listen to what they had to say. Gallagud and Wurn watched Ulligrassor. Ulligrassor, with tears in his eyes, combed wounds on his hands. Raron sat with the others, but no one felt his presence.
On the eighth day of their wait, Rudy fell into despair. Ulligrassor couldn’t help but notice that. He was always there for Rudy’s like a shadow. Rudy’s mood change was noticed by all wanderers, but only Ulligrassor wanted to talk to him.
- Why you’re so sad? – he asked.
- I can’t tell you honestly because I don’t even know what the reason is, – in confusion answered Rudy.
- Well, think about, what exactly allowed the despondency to enslave you?
- I got sad when I started eavesdropping on Muniard and Silgur talks. It’s not their fault. Muniard told the truth about heart of the matter in places where I come from. Silgur told the truth about what I lived. The truth, that I arrogantly ignored. At the time, I thought I was right, but now I have the bitter realization my fatal mistake. That period was the beginning of my greatest delusion.
- You will be right at the moment. The times, circumstances, events and people may change around you, but these will be the conditions that will give you power.
After hearing this, the adept of the eternal silence, Raron, suddenly spoke:
- May I ask you, dear Ulligrassor, is now so cleverly misleading this man, or yourself?
After an acrimonious attack on them, and condemning one of Ulligrassor’s most favorite principles, Raron plunged again into his usual state of detachment. Ulligraszor did not respond. He had the right words and persuasive arguments to explain the reasonableness of the position he had chosen, but he knew that Raron did not care about any arguments.
Ulligrassor cried again, but not because of pain of the wounds on his hands or resentment. Rudy was surprised to see tears dripping on Ulligrassor’s hands. Thus the big drops of tears merged with his blood that was pouring out of fresh, torn-up areas of his long-suffering skin. Ulligrassor was absolutely certain that through this method his wounds would heal much faster.
- What’s wrong with you? – Rudy asked.
- This is my eternal suffering, – Ulligrassor replied.
- Are the others like that?
- No, they’re doing fine.
- Then why are you so bad?
- I’m not feeling so bad, – Ulligrassor objected, – and if for you everything I endure seems unbearable anguish, it’s only your misfortune.
- But you told me yourself, this is your eternal suffering!
- I was wrong. I mean, sometimes I feel really hard. My hands get itchy when I don’t eat enough meat. Right now, I clearly lack what is at my humble disposal. Vuggo knows about it and still doesn’t harvest more venison and fish than usual.
- Yes, Vuggo is very angry. But I’ll help you. Take a quarter of my shares.
- Are you sure you’re ready to share this with me?
- Absolutely. I have no doubt that I can survive with a quarter of this, let’s just say, an unappetizing piece. I’m not used to this kind of food. Sometimes it’s easier for me to starve. Anyway, we can’t let all of this go to waste.
He cut off a little over a quarter of the venison for his needs and put the remaining biggest piece in Ulligrassor’s hand. Ulligrasso’s gratitude revived such a necessary belief for Rudy needed. He was not a bad person. For a while, the despondency left him. Rudy understood another truth. It turned out you could find joy by giving it to another. The rest of the wanderers did not share their elevated mood and looking at everything that was happening with calm. They looked at the Rudy’s action without concealing their great disappointment. But that wasn’t the only thing that embarrassed Rudy.
Day in and day out, while they were waiting for their new journey, Rudy was perplexed to see that the urn with Aurora’s ashes lying on the side, behind a pile of stones. Where he came from, they treated the garbage like that. While each of them took refuge inside their own dome, the urn was in the open space. After the succession sudden attack of “mischiefs of the wind spirits”, the generally recognized value was almost lost, buried under the thickness of white dust.
Convinced that the urn was no longer useful to the wanderers, Rudy hurried to reclaim what had originally belonged to him. When the urn was in his hands, he cried, as the little cute boy, Rudolph Jr., who was always angry with the world.
Bitter resentment turned huge in the big lump in his throat. The urn in which was kept the ashes of his beloved, has lost its beautiful appearance and lost its unique decor, for which has been paid a double price, since he stopped watching it. The exclusive product looked no better than a rusty tin can. Contrary to the vows made to each other and to Aliel, the wanderers did not value what was so brutally taken from Rudy.
He was wrong. As soon as the urn was in his hands, Gallagud angrily ordered Rudy to leave it where it was left by wanderers.
- Why?! – asked Rudy with bewildered.
- It’s Ulligrassor’s responsibility. He found the urn and he’s supposed to be its keeper, – replied Muniard.
- If that’s true, he’s neglecting his duty!
- Talk to him, – said Silgur, – he calls himself your friend, which means he has to take your word seriously. As a friend, talk some sense into him.
- But I can take his responsibility! Under my supervision, the urn will remain intact. Only I am prepared to keep it safe! Only I care about it!
- You can assume other people’s responsibilities elsewhere, but not here, – Gallagud objected, – Ulligrassor’s responsibility lies with him and his conscience, and I advise you to be careful about your conscience and not waste it by covering up other people’s debts.
Realizing that his voice had no power among the wanderers, Rudy decided to talk to Ulligrassor to persuade him to convey his responsibility for keeping the urn. But he couldn’t find Ulligrassor it anywhere. Ulligrassor had an enviable ability to disappear. In order to find such a trickster, it was necessary to devote time to an ardent search, accepting the game offered by him. Rudy was still weak. Fatigue was stronger than purpose. And it was at the exact moment that Rudy gave up and accepted the circumstances, unwilling to do anything that the funny Ulligrassor appeared immediately.
Meanwhile, Wurn approached the peaceful sleeping Migurnock and began to kick him hard in order to bring back a cunning man from a world of unimaginable beautiful dreams to reality. It seemed strange, because earlier, he repeatedly asked for the magic potion from Migurnock for himself.
- Leave him, – said Raron unexpectedly, ­– he didn’t do anything to you.
- That’s the whole point!
- About what?
- He’s not doing anything! He’s lying there like a seal carcass!
- And what’s he supposed to do?
- Anything!
When Wurn was unable to find support from Raron, he finally lost control of himself and was ready to prove his right by Gallagud’s power. But Raron wasn’t afraid of him or Gallagud. He calmly said to Wurn:
- Anyway, at least Migurnock’s doing something. Don’t be mad at him for finding his way to bliss, and he’s not afraid to enjoy it, like we are.
- This is an illusion!
- It doesn’t bother anyone of us. Leave him.
Wurn ceded to Raron, but did not refuse to confront Migurnock. Unwilling to satisfied with little, he wanted the Court of Time to determine who was right and to await a just solution, even if it took years.
Migurnock, whose bizarre image caused Rudy many questions, remained sleeping calmly and be happily unaware of the fact that his brothers had first engaged in an argument for him. Nor did he return to reality when Slargart appeared, which had never happened before. Realizing this, Raron approached Migurnock, took out all of his potions, and found with disappointment that the necessary drinking at that moment remained in the quantity of several drops.

The most hated stretch of the way for Slargart was the White Wasteland. Dozens of times she appeared from nowhere in directions where she had never been before, and doomed the wanderer to the hard ordeal. Small and foggy as a ghost, the White Wasteland appeared instantly in a new place and same instantly disappeared. Even the son of the Great Spirit could find his death under her cold cover, for the White Wasteland was the first creation of Aliel.
Having set foot on the blinding white ground from which clouds of thick dust rose, Slargart remembered the necessary nine thousand steps, which would be safe for him at the Misty Hills, near the place of Aliel. The strain memories of how the fatal White Wasteland tormented him in last time, made Slargart run as fast as he could towards the Misty Hills, but he remembered one of the conditions of moving through the White Wasteland: the faster he moves, the faster the new danger begins to unfold. One day, he made a mistake and gave in to a natural desire. Then he posed a threat to himself. In a fierce opponent, he saw all his qualities. During the brutally attack, Slargart tried to gain control of whoever represented his essence, but the enemy seemed resilient. Only when he remembered his vulnerability, which he had denied until that moment, and after he admitted his only weakness, he managed to avoid a bloody fight, and running out of the White Wasteland. Ever since, Slargart never forgot his vulnerability, but kept it a secret from those who relied on him.
On the way back to the brothers, Slargart lost vigilance. The White Wasteland met him with a disarming void. Slargart was not attacked by monsters, dangerous predators, ferocious enemies, and even himself. Before him the space of silence, tranquility and soft glow extended. Slargart did not perceive what appeared to him as peace and good. The greatest danger is hidden in unconditionally good conditions. Quietly going step by step, Slargart was walking forward and looking around, ready to face off a surprise attack. But nothing happened around him.
Halfway point, Slargart stopped. He heard the creaking sound of someone’s insecure footsteps behind him. Turning around and looked there, Slargart was petrified. For the first time ever, in the White Wasteland, he met a woman. Beautiful, with the right features her face and expressive blue eyes like the Galgian iceberg, she looked at him kindly, and there seemed to be no doubt about her sincerity. Fragile and defenseless, she could not pose a danger to one of the strongest wanderers, but Slargart decided not to confide in the first impression, which still shocked him deeply. He continued his journey, resisting the desire to accelerate.
A few moments later, they got close. A beautiful woman walked next to him. The accumulated tension complicated Slargart’s movements. The shackling cold reminded him of his helplessness. Beyond the infinite white ground there were no Misty Hills. She walking silently and he did not understand what she needed. Her closeness aroused in him to become acutely agitated and unknown whining pain in the center of his chest.
Slargart wanted to look at her – he immediately liked her and she touched the deep feelings in him that were not appreciated among his brothers. He wanted to speak with her, offering his protection, and he wanted to appeal to her for protection.
Contradictory thoughts, like spears, pierced his mind, and the anguish that the White Wasteland had bequeathed to him gained its true strength. But the son of the Great Spirit Aliel could not give in to a fascinating ruse. Without betraying his purpose to his own desire, he walked with confidence and did not look towards a beautiful woman. 
The distance seemed infinite, but could not be said the same about Slargart’s power. The son of Aliel, whom the Father created as a great tracker’s and as a toughest of all wanderers, he was forced to fight with his own weakness in the White Wasteland. It was hurt him to breathe, it hurt to watch, but even that could not be compared to the pain that every step he took caused. The White Wasteland was ruthless with those who found themselves in it, especially if they were Aliel’s favorite children.
It was just as hard for a beautiful woman, but she continued to follow him silently. Her silence was causing a variety, most often terrible, thoughts in Slargart’s mind. He liked her more than anyone he had ever known. He had special feelings for a woman who had so impressed his once-stolid spirit. Slargart realized that deep down, he dreamed of leaving the White Wasteland with a beautiful woman, and show her the lands of Laldiroff, where his power and potential were unlimited. There he could take her into his care and shared his journey home with her. It seemed that before him appeared a dream he’d forgotten about.
However kind and noble his thoughts may be, he clearly understood that at the moment he was possessed by insidious illusions. He tried to deceive himself in wanting to get rid of her presence. Mentally speaking: “Disappear!” countless times, Slargart wanted her to stay.
Beyond the horizon came the Misty Hills. After seeing them, Slargart felt the relief he deserved. But as soon as he was seventeen steps away from the White Wasteland, he lost his temper. It seemed to him that it was on the last stretch of the road that she, who could charm him with her precious, now she would be mercilessly destroyed him. In a fit of anger and despair, he rushed to a beautiful woman, intending to strangle her. She did not resist. There was still no danger around. A beautiful woman quickly lost her powers. Fear, confusion, and shame for his actions forced Slargart to flee. Leaving her, he overcame the remaining steps faster than the wind. Before taking the final step, Slargart looked back. A beautiful woman was lying there like a wounded deer, and it was unclear if she was alive or dead.

Three miles from the new temporary refuge of the wanderers was the small village of Gungs. Peeping at them, wanting to see any changes, Vuggo watched an unfailing picture of their existence. Like parasites, the Gungs split into hundreds of small groups that settled the entire Laldiroff coast. The quick, small but well-developed humans were recognized by the chosen holders of the generous gifts of the Great Water, but their fishing was of questionable gain. They called themselves the great breadwinners. The great gifts that Great Water shared with the world, the Gungs gave for a special, often exorbitant, price. Over time, it became clear that none of the peoples and tribes of Laldiroff could afford to engage with the Gungs. The Gungs demands were not based on need or benefit – they relied on a sickly fad whose scope was not limited.
The wanderers had no choice but to go through a coastal settlement. The interaction of great purpose and petty seemed inevitable. Previously, the wanderers had met the Gungs, but even the wise men Silgur and Muniard failed to negotiate with the madmen. It was later revealed that they must come to an agreement at all costs. For the following communities, the meeting with which was an integral part of the wanderers’ journey, the resources that were available only to the chosen holders of the Great Water were vital. While maintaining a safe distance, Vuggo kept an eye on the Gungs to find out what methods or tricks could be used to influence those who value absolutely nothing.
The chosen holders of the Great Water gifts had long forgotten about their vocation. There were skeletons and rotting remains of large and small whales outside their village. As a true hunter, Vuggo noticed that the slaughter was meaningless. The dead children of the Great Water simply rotted away, bringing no benefit to the needy.
The Gungs constantly bullied each other. Everyone was hysterically demanding attention. The whole time Vuggo was watching them, almost every single one of them cried or had a terrible seizure. The young and the old, the strong and the weak, the main and the insignificant, all of them was suffering and tormented each other in the same way. Vuggo couldn’t look at that anymore.
Three miles back required moral effort. Vuggo was devastated and ready to stop, wishing to fall down and cry, having lost his main fight with despair. The most formidable and powerful son, Alielel, he finally lost his strength when the exhaustion of his true spirit.
While in the rest of the world as hundreds of generations grew and perished, the wanderers walked and sought their place. From the very beginning of their existence, they knew they had a home, but they’ve never been there. The endless search for Vuggo began to lose its sacred meaning. Every tribe, he met was making him to hate them, the Great Spirit and himself. Even the mad Gungs found their place. The most horrendous people had a home. Vuggo’s inspiring belief that one day their journey would be happily completed was cursed by him.
As he approached the temporary refuge, he saw the first real threat for the last decades. There was a beast that he’s never seen before. A giant, hairy wolf was wandering around fresh deer carcasses dragged the biggest carcass. Vuggo thought that he was aware of all the living creatures inhabiting Laldiroff, but he had never seen such a monster and knew nothing about the wolf or its power.
Based on his experience, he assumed that until the next stop the Great Father would not give him reindeer carcasses. In an attempt to prevent the disaster, Vuggo rushed into battle with an enemy whose power was equal or superior to his own. Unleashing his wrath, Vuggo fought fiercely and ruthlessly. To his surprise, the wolf’s reaction was different from the one he was used to see when he fighting with wild animals.
The wolf dodged attacks not instinctive, but wisely. Possessing clear superiority in strength and ability to kill, the beast did not injure Vuggo. There was no winner in the bizarre fight. Inexplicably for Vuggo, the wolf broke out and ran off to the Southern Spots. It was only after it became clear that the beast would not return that the true hunter saw blood on his hands.

- There’s a lot of blood in there right now, and it’s everywhere, – said Silgur, – but it’s a tiny drop compared to the sea, which will overwhelmed all the careless and self-serving people in the future.
- They used to pay with their own and someone else’s blood for a lie for a good that was actually a lie of true evil, – said Muniard, – now they can pay the same, but for real opportunities and benefits. We can denounce the way their aspirations are born, but does that make sense?
- I condemn humankind, but not humanness, – said Silgur, – and it will always be. Humanness is getting smaller and smaller. This great gift has always been inconvenient to people. Humanness is desecrated by humankind. My court is not the scariest. My court is nothing. The Court of the Future will judge fairly. And that is the only thing that makes sense. The future will allow humankind to punish themselves. The wisdom of time is the wisdom of being.
Silgur and Muniard did not notice that Rudy was quietly following them like enchanted, and he listened to their extraordinary conversation.
- The time will soon come when they will allow to be robbed and killed themselves on just grounds, – said Silgur, – and people forgetting that, from generation to generation, a tough rule has been established: justice does not decide for man, but man decides instead of justice. Many would choose to sacrifice themselves to those for whom justice is equated with the desire to destroy everything.
- And there will come a man who would dare to decide other people’s destinies by uprooting the useless roots of the tree of history, – said Muniard, – cutting the living, but unnecessary germinates, watering it with tears of joy, then tears of grief. And he will fertilize the soil with the blood of those who trusted him.
- He will have a worthy company of the same like him men, – said Silgur, – more than be should. The balance will be broken.
- And when the increased power will clouds this man’s already polluted mind, he will suddenly create a dream for himself that the poverty of his own soul will invest in. Before realizing his distorted creation, he will hasten to implement it, bypassing the general order, the unshakeable rules and the principles of justice, – Muniard concluded.
- Ignoring the present, he’s going to target to artificially divide the world, where the powerful peoples at any cost are oppressive to the weaker peoples, imposing barbarism and injustice on once tranquil regions, – Silgur concluded.
The prophecies of Silgur and Muniard made Rudy even more anxious. He didn’t understand how everything they were talking about could come true, but he believed it unconditionally. His family remained in an imperfect world. Rudy hoped to return there. A warning of impending danger didn’t help him. It only made his situation worse. Knowing everything, he couldn’t change anything.
He was unable to listen to the wandering sages more. Rudy has gone away from everyone to calmly indulge to the terrible fantasies about his own future.
- The world will change, but the man who will be responsible for the destruction will not get what he dreamed of, because his dream was not real, – Muniard foretold, – and in the process of the monstrous conquest on the way to the target of his chosen goal, he will become entangled in his own delusions.
- Once he falls into the trap he was planning so painstakingly for others, his strength will be gone, – Silgur foretold, – but that lesson will not be learned by those who follow in his footsteps.

The journey in the new direction turned out to be as long as expect to return of Slargart, but the movement to the goal gave the wanderers vigour and strength. Only Migurnock experienced serious difficulties incompatible with a full-fledged movement. The consequences of his condition were devastating to his health. Raron was managing to pull him out of the trap of deep oblivion, but no one, not even Migurnock himself, was aware of the possible consequences of this experience. But even his sickness did not affect his mood – as always, he was in a strange, exceptionally amusing mood.
Up to a certain moment, Rudy believed he was the only one who been very sad and no one else suffered as much as he does. But, when he looked sideways, he saw a sad picture contrary to his previous convictions. The way what Slargart’s bowed his head, it meant that he was suffering from internal torments from which he had clearly sought to find but not found salvation. Always confident and formidable Slargart, this time he was treading carefully – he continually searched for something, carefully exploring the space around. The mystery thoughts fascinated him. The riddle that consumed the unstoppable giant was perceived as something extraordinary. In the opinion of Rudy, people like Slargart and Vuggo could not feel the anxiety, fear, and all that directed weak or tired people.
- He’s not so brave, – said Ulligrassor, as usual, sneaking up on Rudy from nowhere.
- Like all of us, – Rudy answered.
The dome of Ulligrassor repeatedly collided with the dome of Rudy, inconveniencing both of them, but it’s did not stop Ulligrassor. He sought to capture Rudy’s attention, but the unstoppable Ulligrassor just managed to encroach only on Rudy’s humble personal space. Even if he wanted to, Rudy couldn’t avoid the conversation his friend needed.
- He always disliked me, and now – especially, – when he said this, Ulligrassor turned to a whisper that sounded no quieter than if he had said it without such efforts, – even Vuggo stopped bothering me. Slargart never missed a chance to say to me, that I am cowardly, weak and hopeless.
- Prove him wrong. If you’re being unfairly misrepresented, and that unfair lie is clouded your life, you need to prove everyone who’s important to you that they were wrong about you. Otherwise, you’ll suffer for the rest of your life and you’ll prove your truth only to yourself. It’s important to keep the truth about yourself. Lie about you is not going anywhere. There will always be those who, consciously or unconsciously, but happily arm themselves with the lies, and aggressively attack you. This won’t stop as long as you’re alive, and this won’t stop when you’re dead. For a while, or maybe for a many years to come, you will be judged based on lies.
- I would never die.
Rudy didn’t know how he could counteract that such foolishness.
- You’re right, my friend, – said happy Ulligrassor, – when there are convenient circumstances, I will prove to everyone that I am not a coward and that I can be relied upon. That is not necessary at this time, and I do not feel the need to change the conditions of the present.
- But you told me that you feel bad about that. I see that it bothered you.
- Everything happens as it should happen – hastily answered Ulligrassor, then hid in his dome.
Rudy stopped, believing that he should express his friendly support and wait for Ulligrassor, but seeing that the other wanderers ignored their brother’s escapade and continued to move, he instinctively decided to join them. His gut told Rudy that Ulligrassor would not be lost. And he realised, if he will depart from others and trust his fate to the such a friend like Ulligrassor it’s will be too dangerous for him.

Vuggo did his best. The place of temporary shelter was comfortable, safe, and if the wanderers wanted to settle here for good, it would be the most faithful of their decisions. Next to it was a small glacier called Köyging, around which the streams of snowmelt water – the cleanest and most delicious in the area. The Sharp West Hills was stopping the barbed winds. The Eastern Lowlands was impede to the eternal storms. In the South and the North there were magnificent open spaces. This was a first place that Rudy liked, and he wanted to stay there, because he very tired after their tedious journey.
Vuggo prepared ten carcasses of skillfully cut deer. He did not eat meat until his brothers arrived. At first his food was deer entrails, eyes and ears. For the rest days of his waiting, he fed on fish slices, which at all times, even when he was starving, seemed disgusting to him. To his beloved brother Slargart, he left young reindeer antlers, knowing how Slargart would welcome such a treat.
Near the big bonfire, the wanderers had a real feast. They were having fun with each other. Ulligrassor asked for more meat and received it. Having regained his strength, Migurnock once again plunged into the oblivion that he loved and brothers weren’t disturbing him. Silgur and Muniard told funny stories. Vuggo and Slargart listened carefully to the fun stories and laughed the loudest. Raron sat serenely with his eyes closed and seemed happy. Wurn and Gallagud sat on either side of Rudy and looked after him all evening.
- We’ll have to leave this beautiful place soon, – said Gallagud.
- It’s so nice place, – Ulligrassor replied, – I’d like to stay here.
- We can’t stay here too long, – said Muniard.
- We must not to be content with the convenience, forgetting for the necessary, – said Silgur.
- We will not stop, because we must go all the way to the end, – Gallagud continued, –succumbing to temptation, fear and despair, we will be further away from home.
- But we don’t know what lies ahead, – Ulligrassor argued, – do we have the strength to overcome the unknown?
Silgur and Muniard mysteriously took a look at each other.
- We’ll have a meeting with the Gungs, – said Vuggo, – I saw them three miles north of us. And I don’t know how to negotiate with them – they’re all crazy. Even the Gung’s little kid has a dead mind. What I saw there terrified me.
- We need to know what they need, – suggested Ulligrassor.
- Boredom drives them crazy.
- We’ll offer them some entertainment.
- They’re spoiled with permissiveness and impunity. I don’t think there’s anything we can do to interest the insane. They’re truly terrible and ugly. There are dozens of dead whales are rot around their habitat. The Gungs killed them aimlessly and did not share the meat with the poor men from other settlements. The Gargons are suffering unbearably from centuries of famine and have repeatedly asked for their help. One Gargont was recently brutally beaten by young Gungs when he tried to steal some whale meat. This amused both the young and the old Gungs. Now they howl at the dreadful boredom and pester each other.
After listening to the terrible story about the Gungs, Rudy remembered how he and Aurora watched a film about the Northern people, and they were shocked by an unusual amusement it showed documentalists. He dared to offer his crazy idea:
- What happens if we offer them to get a big slice of whale skin, and then they stand in a circle, take a flap, stretch it out, and we will let them take turns jumping on it, having fun?
The wanderers were surprised by Rudy’s brave and cleverness. Even Raron opened his eyes and smiled.
- They want something they don’t have and which there no such is it anywhere else, – said Vuggo, – this entertainment has long been popular with those you know.
- We can tell them there’s no such thing anywhere else.
- The Aliel’s children despise the lies, – said angry Vuggo, – by resorting to the lie, we turn ourselves into despicable losers!
- The lies are like decay, – said Silgur.
- As soon as there’s a reason for it to appear, lie would get into your life and never going away, – said Muniard.
- And will consume you more and more.
- Until you rot, vile and unworthy.
Rudy took a principled position, and he was not wanting to give up. He found the position imposed on him among the wanderers humiliating and they were  undervalued  his personality.
- I am not afraid of it! – he said.
- Just because you’re not afraid, – said Raron, – doesn’t mean you’re right.
- But if you must do it, you will it. We will not stand in your way, – said Gallagud.
Gallagud’s permission led Rudy to internal contradictions. Suddenly, he doubted the truth of his intention, but was afraid to admit it. He expected to hear a severe ban on any his action. It would absolve him of responsibility for the course of events in the future. He wanted to see his idea in the actions of fearless wanderers. Ulligrassor immediately felt his mood. When he approached Rudy, he said a phrase that could only be heard from his mouth:
- You can never cheat with them, buddy. Don’t take any chances if you can hide and wait out the inconvenience in the cozy ignorance.
Chapter 5. The Gungs
Met by incessant noise and monstrous turmoil, the wanderers entered the village of Gungs without attracting the attention of the indigenous settlers to themselves. Everything in that space has merged in a cold blue glow: from the appearance of the dwellings there to the color of the skin of the Gungs themselves. The wanderers were able to become an invisible part of this picture, and only Rudy was attracting the attention to himself. He couldn’t control the terrifying shock because of the cold and the same fear. The triumph of the Gungs madness was truly frightening. The devious nightmare, detailed in reality, surpassed all the perversions that Rudy’s rich fantasy could allow. Besides, wherever he looked, he was disgusted by all what he saw. But the more crazy plotses appeared in front of his eyes, the more he became obsessed with the co-crazy condition.
There was an old ruins. In the most abundant settlement there was not a single good dwelling – the chaos was destroying everything that was suitable for a dignified life in this place. The Gungs spoiled everything themselves and taught their children that. They took the ruin for granted, and only boredom made them sad. Every Gung was sacrificed by the devastating feelings. Without realizing what they were doing, they turned their worst enemy, into an idol that they were worshipped blindly and furiously.
At the very beginning, Rudy noticed a group of stunningly beautiful children. One of them started to scratch his face till the wounds bled. Other children watched the action with their mouths open. Having gained attention, the boy threw off his luxurious clothes by Gungs standards, exposing unnaturally blue skin, and then he was violently scraped his hands and then feet. The attention of the children was lost when he was literally tearing up the skin on his stomach. Self-torture gave him nothing but terrible pain and deadly cold, but the boy laughed loudly and he looked around, assessing the reaction of those whose attention was on his side. In his eyes there was an unnatural, almost ecstatic pleasure and a recognizable fear. He was afraid that he might not see from the children an invaluable look for him.
The other kids wanted to scratch it with their tiny little hands too, but the boy wouldn’t let them. With no other thought, another boy immediately freed himself of his humble clothes and began to scratch himself just the same way. The attention of the children immediately and completely passed him. He let the others to scratch it. The howl of the first boy, who scratched himself wherever he could, merged with those howl the poor Gungs just like him, who were no longer receiving attention.
Having gone deep into the settlement, the wanderers encountered a large congregation of young and mature Gungs. They all watched a mature woman offering her body to any man. Her appearance was unpleasant and repulsive. The seductive tricks luring the Gungs, Rudy watched with disgust. Her cry like an animal, crazy tumbling, and body movements resembling convulsions aroused the howling crowd. In her hands, there was something known only to the Gungs themselves. That’s what she repeatedly rubbed her crotch, screaming even louder.
A young man responded to her ferocious appeal. When he approached her, he looked at her carefully and checked what she was rubbing her crotch. Clearly approving of what he had seen, he was also rubbing his crotch impatiently and thus expressed his willingness to take advantage of the offered body. Without resorting to foreplay, they began shamelessly copulate in front of a jubilant crowd. Attention to the mature woman and the young man was ample, but at one point the looks and faces of the crowd turned the other way. There was the young woman who lived with that young man. She declared her intention to offer her own body. She did exactly what her predecessor did, but in this case the response was much quicker. A few men at once expressed their willingness to take advantage of her offer. The special mood possessed everyone who gathered in that place.
Completely consumed by the wild spectacle, Rudy did not notice that he was left alone in the epicenter of the filthy debauchery. The wanderers have long since left the place of improvised orgies. In a panic, he tried to get out of there. He gently broke through the crowd, and miraculously escaped the violence a couple of times.
He didn’t have to look wanderers for long. He saw Ulligrassor at first. His new friend spoke to the children they had met in the beginning. When Rudy was spotted, Ulligrassor pointed his finger at him. Pretty kids ran right over to Rudy. Surrounding him, they showed their skills to scratch, and some of them to bleed ourselves. Faced with another setback, Rudy counted on Ulligrassor’s friendship help, but instead saw his friend leave in a hurry in an unknown direction.
The kids were circling around him like a swarm of angry bees. One of them thought it would be funny for him to bleed Rudy, which he did. Each Gung had a small sharp sharpened spear. Rudy learned about it when the spears of the children simultaneously bumped into his dome. The new fun was intrigued the little Gungs – they couldn’t stop, and tried to break up his safe haven. All things had indicated that Rudy had no chance of salvation, but the loud female screams changed the course of events. The mothers called their children to see another spectacular action.
The wanderers found the place where the Gungs congregation was the largest at the time. The young Gung offered the crowd to appreciate his talent in swallowing stones. With a proud to himself, he displayed the small and medium-sized stones painstakingly collected by him on the coast. Some of the stones had sharp edges, but this did not stop him. The thirst to arouse the excitement of the crowd inspired young Gung to extraordinary achievements and he swallowed the first stones with ease.
Rudy arrived at the scene too late – when young Gung was choking and could not swallow the remaining stones. The wanderers stood closest to the young man and watched indifferently as he tried to do anything to get the most attention. Even Ulligrassor was not impressed with the sophisticated spectacle – he was much more interested in watching the reaction of the Gungs-viewers. To one of them, Ulligrassor whispered something playfully in his ear, after which Gung took a small stone that lay beneath their feet and delivered it to the Gung-eater, so that he could eat this “treat”. The mood of total madness was gaining momentum. Each Gung-viewer carried to the Gung’s-eater by stone, and some of them again and again came back with regular “treats”. Young Gung reached long-awaited happiness, but his possibilities were not unlimited. Having dropped dead in front of grateful viewers, he opened up space for a new action.
The free space was claimed by the wanderers. Gallagud demanded the attention of the crowd. His good-natured greeting was not sincere. By fawning before the Gungs, he squandered what he had always cherished – his principles and dignity. This hypocrisy was supported by the rest of the wanderers. Even the wisest of them, Silgur and Muniard, took an annoying necessity for granted.
The Gallagud’s message resonated solemnly:
- We came to you with the knowledge of the amusement that is unknown to the world and can be yours!
The Gungs embraced the news with ecstatic. The screams of joy shook the space. The ground shook from the poplar of their feet. One by one, they cried with joy.
- To do so, you must capture Varlung and, as a thank you for our help, we will take the Suloon.
The joy of the Gungs left them in a moment.
- Great Water won’t forgive us if we kill her son, – said old Gung, – we, too, once needed the Suloon, but we knew what was most important to us. The trust of the Great Water is the great gift that keeps us alive. We don’t need fun that costs so much.
- We need it! – little Gung screamed.
- We need it! – the mother of little Gung screamed too.
All the Gungs started shouting about their desire to try mysterious amusement. For this they were willing to pay any price. With no extra effort, Gallagud succeeded.
The wanderers paraded the Gungs to Cozy Bay. The crowd rejoiced. The bait of new need gave them inhuman vivacity. The joyful dances of the madmen created vortices, one of which accidentally caught Rudy. Defenceless and childishly confused, he could barely break out of the insane circle himself. At the moment when he began to lose his mind from the unbearable tension, Ulligrasso’s hand felt his neck. Brutal like a father, he pulled Rudy out of a dangerous trap and giving him a sobering kick in the ass in the end.
As they approached the Great Water, the Gungs calmed down. Adhering to their ancestors' tradition of summoning the Great Gift, they fell to their knees and each time the wave reached the shore, they bowed, skined their foreheads on sharp stones. Before bowing, they shouted the sacred word “Ung”. The echoes of their call spread over many miles. The Gargonts were the first to hear them. There were times when the echo sounded several days, and the cry “Ung” was remembered by them as “Gung”. For the Gargonts the word “Gung” was considered as a dirty word, because they hated the great breadwinners for greed, permissiveness and by that time the madness that possessed them.
Despite the efforts of the Gungs, Varlung did not appear. The foreheads of the great breadwinners were smashed and looked like one huge wound, the stones beneath them were drowned in their hot blood, and echoes of their call found no response. The Great Water did not give them even the gifts that had been generously shared with them before. The failure quickly extinguished their inner fire. One part of the Gungs fell into hysterical despair, the other into fierce anger. Every single one of them, they were prepared to brutalize those who misled them and from whom they received nothing.
The wanderers were not afraid. They were not embarrassed by the possibility of a violent massacre against them. The Gungs were always killing their mostly imaginary enemies long and savagely. They liked it, but there was no one whom they do to kill, and the Gungs couldn’t dare to kill each other. For the last time, the crazy joys of the madmen happened when they having fun by the torturous deaths of the peaceful Ludivs – the old wise men who spent their entire lives searching for lost settlements in the expanses of Laldiroff to impart knowledge to all who should have gained it and were killed to console the fools who they shouldn’t have found. Since then, all roads to their village have been erased, and the Gungs themselves have ceased to be considered human.
The Gungs wanted blood. In order to save the situation, Gallagud took the urn of Aurora’s ashes and solemnly demonstrated it to the angry crowd.
When the attention of the madmen was skilfully caught, Gallagud opened the urn and immersed in its first his left and then a right hand. As he raised his ashed hands to the sky, he said:
- Come to me, and I will give all of you strength that no one within Laldiroff has! Even Great Water will obey to the possessor of this power and, at his command, will humbly sacrifice her beloved son, the oldest and strongest Varlung.
The exhortations of Gallagud worked. Like the snakes, the Gungs crawled upon their charmer. They obeyed to his insolent desire, in order to carry out their indiscreet intentions. Their mad faces radiated a fiery obsession. With sweet anticipation, they expected a future with new possibilities.
Rudy was shocked by the actions of Gallagud. When the first Gung came to collect his share of the promised power, Gallagud extended his hand and told him to lick the tip of his index finger. Without concealing his admiration, Gung did what was him told, to the most diligent but not in the most beautiful way.
All the Gungs, the wanderers and the Rudy, as the enchanted watched Gallagud’s hand. He dropped it back in the urn and immediately took it out, showing the ashes on the tip of his index finger. Gallagud was ordering to Gung to kneel and raise his head up, and then he rubbed this finger between Gung’s eyebrows and after a loud announcement: “Now you are power!” he let an improved Gung make his new story.
The sacrilege over Aurora’s ashes aroused in Rudy a beast’s wrath, which was immediately crushed by Vuggo’s powerful push. Before five steps to Gallagud, he was severely knocked down. Its defensive and once-reliable dome disintegrated like a loose paper structure. Vuggo immediately recognized Rudy’s intentions and blocked any attempts to implement them. To prevent him from rising, Vuggo pinned Rudy’s wretched head to the ground by his huge leg, thus forcing Rudy to watch with folded the evil unfold.
The Gungs roared with excitement. Despite the barriers they caused to each other, each of them received its intended share of great power. Showing off their interbrow marks, the madmen circled in a solemn dance that had evolved on its own and looked quite spectacular. Small stones flew under their feet, causing Rudy literally to suffer – one rock nearly knocked out his eye. Vuggo knew no pity or compassion. He would not let Rudy’s head out from under his feet, even when the horrific act had been completed and the dance had turned into another attempt to summon Varlung.
Their call to the Great Water sounded louder, their bows were more furiously, and the bloody splashes of their broken foreheads splashed on the different sides, mixing with each other. The total ecstasy took possession of the Gungs. The belief that they were the one – the great power – worked a miracle.
The deadly cold caught up with the defenceless Rudy, offering the unhappy its contradictory gift of oblivion. He was given a conditional choice. Before making his choice, he tried to assess the situation. The hasty analysis was difficult for him. His situation was monstrous. The wanderers did not try to save his life, he could not prevent the sacrilege over Aurora’s ashes, the meaning of further journey was never found him.
Leaving the last hope, Rudy accepted the conditions of the deadly cold and left the evil Vuggo, the cold-hearted wanderers, the mad Gungs, at the very moment when the giant whale, that Varlung, washed up on shore and was mercilessly killed by those people to whom his mother gave generous gifts from century to century.
Chapter 6. The priceless gift of lies
The death was postponed indefinitely. The wanderers snatched Rudy from the deadly embrace of oblivion, to whom he gullibly succumbed.
Rudy was alive, but he felt destroyed. The bitterness in his mouth caused him to spasm of vomiting every minute. Each breath was accompanied by a painful burn inside. The body refused to obey him. The acute headache was the crowning achievement of his physical suffering. The hard thought that there is nothing better than death in life dominated his mind, and neutralising all the life-affirming arguments Rudy once cling to.
- You’re wrong, you spoiled fool, – told him Vuggo.
The most evil and cruel of the wanderers was the closest. He was sitting next to Rudy and painstakingly building a new Rudy’s dome.
- If you’re doing this for me, then stop right now, – barely said Rudy, – I don’t want anything from you.
- You do. Everybody wants something from me.
Vuggo could not tolerate the close presence of anyone near him for long. Wanting to make his job easier and free himself from the unwanted company, he briefly left one of his favorite activities and came close to Rudy. Holding his enemy on his shoulders like the carcass of a newly killed deer, Vuggo took Rudy to their temporary camp, wanting to hide him as far away as possible. He thought he was doing what was best for the spoiled fool. To the surprise of Rudy and Ulligrassor, who rushed after them, Vuggo found a small but cozy cave where Rudy could recuperate. There, he carefully laid Rudy on the luxurious reindeer skins. Never had Vuggo shared his good with anyone before that day.
- If you try to take a piece of this, I’ll skin you alive! – he threatened to Ulligrassor.

Somewhere in the distance, the hysterics screams of the Gungs were heard. The strength was slowly returning to Rudy. He looked around and realized that they had not yet left the Cozy Bay.
The slain and torn apart Varlung was lying on the shore. The Son of the Great Water was humiliated and destroyed for the satisfaction of the senseless bliss that possessed the madmen. Rudy thought Great Water wanted to take Varlung’s remains. The waves kept getting higher and tried to get as far as possible, but it’s still couldn’t get close enough to touch him.
The Gungs liked the new fun. Having stretched Varlung’s skin, they joyfully bounced around, throwing everyone wanting to fly to the sky. Their madness was under control. It was held by Raron, who beat the rhythm on his drum. That rhythm guided the Gungs' movements, maintaining a delicate balance between hysteria and order. Enjoying the trance and the fun of the new amusement, the Gungs were shouting something obscure. That was their wild delight.
- These monsters have no right to call themselves human – said Rudy.
- And yet they are people, – replied Ulligrassor, – there’s a lot of what we don’t accept or who we don’t accept. Our opinion doesn’t affect anything. Non-acceptance affects only ourselves, taking us away from the realization of good opportunities. It seems to us that we are involuntarily subject to what is mercilessly torturing us, but we actually do it willingly. It’s easier for someone who can deceive himself. But that relief is short-lived.
- All of you keep telling me about the destructive power of lies. Gallagud was just as angry at me for wanting to use harmless deception for our common cause. What about him?! How could he dare to deceive the Gungs?! Or you doesn’t really despise lies?! Or are you not the children of Aliel?!
- Gallagud deliberately chose to lie, not as an opportunity, but as the only solution. Before we found you and your gift, the fateful time has me and my brothers endlessly through the Laldiroff’s land, each time misdirecting us. We have dignified take the path that has been chosen for us, carried the will of our Father, and endured ordeals that would have been hard for you to imagine, but we have never been able to get near our home. At the very beginning of our wanderings, Aliel told us that the way to the house would be difficult, and we could get to the cherished place if we could pass through the settlements of the Gungs, the Gargonts, the Margalons, the Visgs and the Sirlebings. Should I tell you how desperate we are if we have never reached the Margalons in all this time?
- Why?
- Obviously, we were doing something wrong. From time to time, when faced with the mad Gungs and then with the unhappy Gargonts, it seemed to us that the actions of truth and conscience had helped us, but then our wanderings were stopped. Everywhere we went, nowhere was the right way. Many times the living hope had become a deaf pain, which we have pacified in long journeys without meaning and without desire. We found you when we were going through the same things hardship. It was a gift from our Father! You helped us to venture into something that we didn’t accept from all years past, and it gave us two opportunities that we didn’t previously have. Now we can break this vicious circle.
- Aliel gave me to you...
- And you’ve introduced to us the priceless gift of deception.
- But may I ask why the ashes of my beloved are so powerful?
- Among the eternal monotony within Laldiroff, great power can hide in anything. If we were more bloodthirsty, your severed hand could be the symbol of suggestion for the Gungs. Gallagud showed them what they wanted internally, but deprived of because of their own misconceptions. He gave them an illusion, which they at first gladly accepted as the truth, and then turned into the truth. So conditionality became a reality. Their faith helped them lure Varlung out and kill him.
- Wasn’t it too cruel to sacrifice Varlung?
- The Great Water has always sacrificed its children for the amusement and baser needs of the Gungs. Look what it cost to her love of some and not to love others. She let one kill the other for nothing. Varlung is her most beloved son, but he is just as her child as that poor creatures. Wasn’t it too cruel to sacrifice them?
- I don’t even know for which, in principle, it is necessary to make a sacrifice. Especially, when it’s so monstrous and pointless.
- That’s exactly what our Father told the Great Water. His words and arguments were heard, but it’s were not accepted, and since that time, there has been an irreconcilable dispute between Great Water and Father, which we will put an end to.
Near the mauled Varlung stood Gallagud and the devoted him Wurn. With obvious tension, they awaited the main moment of their entire intent. Migurnock was inside within Varlung – only he could get the desired Suloon. Too much time has passed that gives them nothing. Gallagud and Vurrn lost faith in their cruel deed. There was not a no one encouraging signal from Migurnock.
Ulligrassor closely kept an eye on things of that and waited for the return of Migurnock as much as his brothers. The most sensitive of the wanderers, he felt both hope and anxiety, but Migurnock’s prolonged absence did not cause him the destructive doubt that Gallagud and Wurn had feeling in.
In the distance, in the darkest place of Cozy Bay, Vuggo bowed to his work, and the bitterness of his disappointment nearly exposed in front of others the broken spirit of the strongest and most ferocious son Aliel. Vuggo stopped believing that Migurnock could get the Suloon, but he was wrong.
The scary, covered in the filthy mucus of the Varlung’s insides that he explored, but as cheerful as ever, Migurnock clumsily emerged from Varlung, showing his brothers the desired Suloon. Contrary to the original principles that guided the wanderers from the beginning of their existence, Gallagud and Wurn did not restrain their joy and gave their brother a firm hug. Then they started calling for the others, but only two rushed to them.
- It’s big, – said Silgur, when he was looking at the Suloon.
- It’s precious, – said Muniard.
Vuggo was more pleased than anyone, but his personal beliefs prevented him from joining the general jubilation. He tried to hide what he thought was his own weakness of the others. When Vuggo turned his back on them, he smiled and, fighting back tears of happiness, continued his work. The dome for Rudy was almost ready.
Slargart did not seek to share the joy with his brothers, though he tried to show that he had joined the triumph. His mood was revealed by an insincere smile and a completely absent look. Slargart’s attention was not that moment, nor himself.
- Why aren’t you with them? – Rudy asked Ulligrassor.
- Before I found your gift, they all tolerated my presence, but they didn’t accept me. I was not worthy of their attention, encouragement or even a little respect. I was led but never listened to. They talked to me, but they never approached me. Their attention to me was only born when I should have been scolded, blamed, or preached, and then that attention died, and I followed them again for decades like a shadow. If this had happened sooner, they wouldn’t have let me join them in their joy. Now I don’t want to be there myself. I’ll be with you.
- Why didn’t you leave them?
- Our Father won’t approve it. Although... to be honest, I have nowhere to go. Over the years of wandering, I have seen the price of living among the Gungs and the Gargonts. Rarely, but we did meet nomadic families and itinerant representatives of other settlements, but I've realized I have no place among them. It doesn’t sadden me, for I have not seen the Margalons, the Visgs and the Sirlebings. My brothers didn’t tell me what life was like in these settlements, but I hope I’ll want to stay somewhere if I’m accepted.
- Have you thought about how you’re going to be able to have a full and happy life if you leave your brothers forever? I understand your desire and I agree with your reasons, but you’ve been with them your whole life. It all seems simple at first glance.
Rudy reasoned, based on his experience. Once he almost lost the warm place under the “wing” of his influential father.
- I’m not gonna talk about what I don’t know, – Ulligrassor reluctantly responded, after which he makes a face like a capricious child, and left Rudy, going to a place where the mad Gungs danced and jumped remarkably beautifully, trying to fly to the sky. Without altering his nature, he sought to see and memorize an action unprecedented in the lands of Laldiroff, and possibly join the madmen.
Feeling that his strength were sufficient, Rudy decided to approach the jubilant wanderers. He couldn’t stop thinking about what he did not know and could not explain, so he decided to seize the moment and resort to Silgur’s universal knowledge, but the wanderers, for reasons he could not understand, kept him out of their circle. Then he understood how did feeling Ulligrassor himself before. Gallagud, Wurn, Silgur, Muniard, and Migurnock, who used to be kind and once open to sincere conversation, at that moment they were ruthless when they drove Rudy away from themselves.
It seemed crazy, but Rudy thought and believed that a dangerous and ferocious Vuggo would reveal to him the secret of their joy. Sneaking up on the evil giant gently, he was increasingly hesitant, but he wouldn’t stop. He was afraid of whom was too hard on him the whole time. Fear had the power over Rudy, and he was never ashamed of it, but the much stronger power and powerful driving force remained behind his natural curiosity. And what a surprise it was to him when his faith and hope came true.
Like an animal, Vuggo’s hunch immediately caught the live creature’s approach to him. The evil giant, obviously wasn’t feeling threatened. He didn’t even turn around. Before Rudy’s question, without turning back, he spoke first.
- Is it really important for you to know the reason for our joy? – he asked.	
- If I’m here with you, so it’s important to me.
- It’s just a lowlifes desire to satisfy your unhealthy interest. Don’t confuse the meanings, even if it’s a benefit to you.
- So you’re not gonna tell me anything?
- You’re wrong. I’m the only one who can tell you that.
Vuggo asked Rudy to sit down and, before beginning the story, showed him the finished dome he had worked so hard on. This dome was prettier, more comfortable and more reliable than the one before. Averting Rudy’s words of gratitude, Vuggo began the story Rudy’s had been waiting for.
- Varlung was rightly considered the beloved son of the Great Water. He was majestic and powerful, but his brothers and sisters, to be fair, were no worse than his. You’ve already witnessed how blind and unreasonable Great Water’s love can be. She allowed and forgave Varlung what was under severe and merciless prohibitions for others. Great Water sacrificed her weak and defenceless children for the Gungs, relentlessly throwing them ashore. These were her legendary gifts. Those who escaped such a tragic fate could have been the victims of Varlung at any moment. When permissiveness and force poisoned his spirit, Varlung began to brutally slaughter anyone caught in his way, driving his brothers and sisters to an ice drift occurs, where one false move doomed an innocent living being to an excruciating death. In a matter of days, he almost wiped out all of children of Great Water. Their Mother did not stand up for any of them. Then, for the sake of justice, Aliel intervened. He cursed Varlung, and put a lifelong burden on him – Varlung should have lived with the Suloon formed near his heart. The small sac, compared to Varlung’s great heart, it’s a concentration of poison capable of killing all life and even the spirit, no matter what the power behind who is to be poisoned. The Suloon was stored in a fragile casing and was near the heart, so that in the fateful moment, if Varlung succumbed to the temptation to kill someone and pursued a new victim, the strength of his heartbeat would inevitably rupture this fragile casing and free the poison. To our Father’s great wisdom, the Great Water responded with a great trick – in order to protect the beloved son and delight the beloved Gungs, she began to throw on the shore all of her unrecognized children, liberating space for Varlung and shielding him from dangerous temptation. Today, we have defeated the cunning of the Great Water, using her cunning against her.
- I still don’t understand why you need a Suloon?
- For too long, we walked on complicated roads that have led us to ordeals that were unnecessary. Confusion and senseless suffering caught up with us again and again. Every time we got to where we begin, despair prevailed us, and we went into voluntary oblivion. Sleeping under the clear snow by the nameless glacier was a salvation from fatigue and excruciating disbelief, but Father kept waking us up so we could continue our journey. With the destructive power of his rage, he smashed a nameless glacier. Huge chunks of ice were falling next to us. The earth was shaking for miles around. Aliel banished us from the most wonderful place within Laldiroff, but then we’d go back to make it happen again…and again…and again.
Weak and exhausted, we were climbing out of a place where we were really happy. Alel gave me more strength than the others and I went hunting. My prey helped me and my brothers gradually recover. Each time, it was harder for us to get stronger. Our strength was coming back longer than usual. The lost power was not being restored. We began the new journey with much less opportunity than we had before. No matter what we do, no matter where we go, the things that we’ve been trying hard to hide from are inevitable. Exhausted from the exhausting journeys, this time we decided we would put an end to our hopes. If evil doom to mislead us and will lead us astray from the right path to our home again, we will gladly accept the Suloon’s venom, and finally find free.
Unexpectedly for Rudy, there was a sudden change in his sense of the surrounding space. Intense pressure in a matter of seconds made his body pains. Seeing this, Vuggo quickly grabbed the dome with one hand, and the other hand, as usual, rudely raised Rudy.
- Grab your belongings and climb the furthest hill! There you will be safe! You won’t have to wait long, so don’t go to sleep! Be careful when you’re alone! Now hurry up! – he commanded.
Based on his bad experience, Rudy realized that something terrible was about to happen. He had not dared disobey Vuggo’s order. The new dome was an order of magnitude heavier than the old one, but Rudy found himself a much heavier burden. From the strain and the intense pain, every move he took required excessive effort. From the weakened hands, his heavy burden was constantly falling. Rudy wasn’t hearing the noise of the Ocean, Gungs crazy fun and Raron’s drum anymore. He was feeling the tormented increasing noise that happened to him when he had the fever as a child. The pressure became unbearable. There was nothing to breathe. The dark, wandering spots that darkened the sight turned to total blindness.
By a miracle, or with the help of the Great Spirit of Aliel, Rudy overcame the arduous way, but he could no climb to the hill. Powerlessness seemed fatal. Rudy fell humbly down. He was going to die and anticipated joyous relief. The same feelings, thoughts and intentions arose when he passed the ordeal of the penultimate drop. Like back then, this time, a beautiful deer came out of nowhere. Like back then, this time, Rudy ended up on the huge antlers of a deer. Like back then, this time, a deer took him to the top of a hill.
The hill was indeed a place of salvation. Rudy could inhale the air. There he felt no death pressure. With each breath, a sense of life returned. With each exhalation, the pain and the premonition of death were gone. It seemed that more power had returned to him than had been lost.
Wanting to know what was going on between the wanderers and the Gungs, Rudy crawled to the edge of the hill and looked down. From the top a magnificent view of the Cozy Bay was opened. The Gungs continued to have fun, having more fun and making more noise. Far from them, near the mauled Varlung, the wanderers sat side by side. Playing their drums, they appealed to the Great Water. Rudy couldn’t hear the splendid song that the devoted sons of Aliel sang. Sometimes there was a beautiful but incomprehensible echo of one or more merged words, in a language he did not know.
The Great Water heard their song. Her color became sinister, dark, and the sound of waves sounded like a roar. It shouted the bitterness of her loss. The wanderers listened to her, bowing their heads. They beat into their drums without stopping until Gallagud told them: “It’s time”.
Upon hearing it, the brothers laid down the drums and rose from their knees. Paying tribute to the Great Water, they dragged Varlung closer to the shore so that the wave could take his remains home. Through the efforts of the wanderers, Varlung found his final peace in the dark depths beyond the reach of any living soul.
When the noise of the Gungs' fun began to drown out the quiet song of the memory of Varlung, the Great Water changed her color and calmed down. Her bright blue glow immediately struck young Gung, who was tossed up to the sky. After catching a new, more intense temptation, he demanded that he be released from the general amusement, and as soon as he was allowed to set foot on the ground, he ran to the water, selflessly obeying to her call. But he wasn’t the only one, who the Great Water called upon. All as one, the Gungs have forgotten about the fun. Having thrown Varlung’s skin, they ran to the welcoming call, knocking each other off their feet. They knew that Great Water could embrace everyone, but arrogance and vanity remained the main power of the Gungs, provoking each of them to accept her weasel first.
The joy overflowed the Gungs. The waves gently picked up those who were close to shore and carried them to the depths. Fully trusting their benefactor, the Gungs obeyed her movements, failing to notice that the streams were apidly rushed them to a huge whirlpool.
Even insanity did not prevent them from realizing that the all-embracing love of the Great Water had turned into her irreconcilable hatred. The gentle waves became part of a vortex from which they could no longer be rescued. The Gungs, whose desire to get the weasel of the Great Water before the others turned out to be the strongest, were the first to be cast to the doom. Without pity for anyone, the Great Water wiped out a settlement of once great holders of her gifts, which she turned into insane inhumans herself.
When it was over and the wanderers went up the hill, Rudy asked them:
- Why did the Big Water spare all of you? That was you who made the Gungs kill Varlung.
- That is the priceless gift of lies, – reluctantly responded Gallagud.
- Gift or curse, – told about his doubt Muniard.
- It’s a gift today and the curse – tomorrow, – said Silgur.
Chapter 7. Love
Turn away on me, and forget,
Everything that happened yesterday,
There’s no turning back.

Look back for a moment,
Look at our way.
Find your forgiveness for yourself.

And forgive your weakness.
And say goodbye at last,
With what was yours,
But not with you forever.
“She wrote terrible poetry”, – thought Rudy, when he remembered short episodes of his lost life. Aurora was torturing him with the pompous recitation of her writings often. Sometimes it’s been pathetically monologues, but the thing she liked most was to come up with short poems with a mixed message and primitive syllable. Many of the lines consisted the scathing mockery to some of Rudy’s personality traits. Sometimes, in a harsh and extravagant form, she mocked some situation that seemed critical at first sight. Paradoxically, Rudy remembered much of her unrecognized and hidden from public poetry. It’s been passages or verses that many times come up in memory, turning the clear and consistent flow of his thoughts into confusion. And only the last poem that she wrote in the saddest part of her life, Rudy remembered from the first to the last word. But he never called himself a fan of her talent.
At the halfway to the Gargonts, the wanderers made the unexpected decision to make a long stop and wait for the right moment when they would know: what time to meet the Gargonts would be successful and what actions on their part would be appropriate. While watching the others, Rudy was perplexed. The temporary stop could stretch for eternity. The area in which they found themselves had no name. A dark, harsh place, where even Vuggo suffered from the cold, was completely unsuitable for the preservation of life. In everything: in the colour of the frozen earth, in the air, in the crushing silence and the dark skies, there was an inexorable hopelessness. Aware of Rudy’s anxiety, none of the wise men and experienced wanderers rushed to explain the reasons and consequences of their decision.
Remembering Vuggo’s story of how the wanderers, exhausted by long and inconsolable journeys, hid near the nameless glacier, wishing to fall into eternal sleep, Rudy suggested that the story was likely to be repeated. Alongside them, there was a small glacier with a lot chunks of grey ice around it. Despite its harsh and inhospitable environment, this area made Rudy confident that there they’ll never be disturbed by any living thing. The wanderers were in a good mood. Apparently, they were excited about something particularly important.
Migurnock, having completed the necessary processes with the obtained Suloon, has given to Gallagud a poison drink created by it, after which, without explanation, he hastily left brothers and got as far away as possible. Finding a suitable place where he could hide from the inquisitive eyes, Migurnock conveniently lay down to escape into oblivion and wrapped himself by his favorite deerskins. He valued those skins because Vuggo gave them to him, but nobody knew about it. The days when Vuggo and Migurnock were real friends are over. He never forgot it and continued to appreciate what had long been lost.
During his first journey, Rudy watched as the Ulligrassor lay beside Migurnock. They slept quietly, away from the fuss and the chatter. This time, he wanted to hide behind the harmless giant himself. After the monstrous sacrifice at Cozy Bay, Gallagud and Wurn followed his every move, and seemed assessed on everything he said and did. It was not easy to be around Ulligrassor, whose talk did not stop until the incessant chatter began to anger Vuggo. The ferocious giant aggressively sent away Ulligrassor and Rudy in different directions, each time threatening to throw heavy stones at them. Slargart didn’t let anyone near him. Silgur and Muniard, with their clever stories and predictions, darkened Rudy’s memory, as did hopes for the future. Rudy couldn’t even think of communicating with Raron. Against the background of his brothers, the sleeping Migurnock was rightly regarded as the best companion for at least a couple of hours.
Finding peace and quiet, Rudy lay down under the warm side of Migurnock. The sense of security relaxed him to the extent when the bold move was not perceived as a risky act by him, and he shamelessly began to pull the hide of the giant.
- It’s kind of interesting, – said laughing Migurnock, who, as it turned out, was not asleep at all.
At the same moment, Rudy had the right reaction to the circumstances – to run away somewhere just to get away, but his body, shackled by fear, did not respond to the signal of anxiety, keeping the situation unchanged.
- I’m not the one you should be afraid of, – calmed him Migurnock, – I won't hurt you. Although, if you tell the others I was pretending to be asleep, you’ll be in trouble.
- I won't tell anyone about it, – Rudy assured, and he wasn’t lying about that.
- Unfortunately, I don’t go into oblivion as often as they think. And I’m better off there than anywhere else. There, I can be whoever I want to be, and I can do really good things. There, I always find a reaffirmation to the necessity of my existence. It’s not here, and I don’t want to be here.
- I understand you, – Rudy didn’t lie again, – I don’t want to be here either.
- Try to remember those memories that heal your heart and calm your mind. Hold on to what makes your breath loose. The way of life and the habits of the wanderers is beyond you. Save your nature. And now, when you’re on the hard way with us, you can orient by your inner state just like I’m orient by that star over there – he pointed at the sky where there were no stars.
- I don’t see it.
- But I can see it clearly, wherever I’m. It’s beautiful star and it’s shining only for me. I call it the Tiegunna. Find your star, too.
- If it was only that easy…
- It’s easy. What are your thoughts about right now?
- All I can reflect about now is love.
- Tell me about love, – Migurnock requested, – I never had that feeling.
- It’s a lot harder to say about love than it is to find a star in the sky right now. It’s a happiness that can turn into grief. It’s a joy can turn into sorrow in an instant. Without that feeling, life is inferior. When you love, you experience a lot. When you love, you’re ready to give everything you’ve got. When you love, you sacrifice a lot. You sacrifice yourself. Love is wonderful when it’s mutual. Love is insidious when you’re not ready for it. Love is terrible when it’s unrequited. I was happy in love. But now, if there was a some deity in front of me, or your Father Aliel, if He proposes me to take the love out of my life and erase the past from my memory, maybe I would agree to that.
- I can’t imagine, how you can feeling love you’re describing. How can you love the bowl? – Migurnock was surprised.
- It’s not the bowl! It’s the urn! And I loved what was in it!
- Did you love ashes? – Migurnock was surprised more.
- No! I loved a living woman!
Migurnock smiled. Evidently, he lacked the knowledge and experience that would inspire him to embrace all about Rudy said. Fortunately or most sadly for him, he was deprived of an elementary understanding of a miracle what an ordinary person called love.
- And what’s the good behind all this? – he asked.
- What’s so good about that world where you so desperately want to be?
- I told you everything. The same cannot be said of you. My gut tells me about this.
- You're wrong, – said Rudy, – I just don’t know how to put into words what you’re asking. My vocabulary is not enough, and I don’t want to talk about my innermostly casually, and I won’t do it.
- Then tell me, my friend, how did you know you love? Maybe, you confused that feeling by replacing it with something completely different.
- It’s impossible to confuse with anything. I was happy as long as part of my life was closely related to Aurora’s presence. The life-affirming ideas and plans passed through me, and inspired me to new ambitions. I was overwhelmed with joyous anticipation. From time to time, I had the happy realization that it was my woman who was with me.
Her voice was fondling my hearing. Her beauty summoned in me an incredible response. Her wisdom smoothed out all the sharp angles that inevitably arise in a relationship between two individuals. Then, with her, I could remain me and not restrain my true being. She opened the way of giving pleasure for me, always letting me go first. Unlike the women I’ve been with before, she has not put any obstacles in my way, and she has allowed me to keep to myself everything that was important to me. While she was alive, I got what I needed.
- In this enchanting, beautifully monologue, I heard only about your love for yourself, – said Migurnock.
His acrimonious utterance hurt Rudy.
- If it was the way you say it is, I wouldn’t be in this terrible place! Never! In my past life where I had all the benefits and all the doors were open to me, obviously I’m being happy. Now I wander the austere places and watch the events that are contrary to common sense. I’m unhappy! I’ve put a lot of effort and all of my money into bringing the ashes of my beloved to this place – a place where ships don’t get to and where any normal person doesn’t want to be. It was her dream, and if it wasn’t for you and your brothers, I could make it happen.
- I think it was not love that drove you to such a great act, but guilt. My gut tells me about this.
- No! – angrily said Rudy.
- My gut never lets me down.
- Damn it! Go to hell with your bloody gut!
Not wanting to stay with Migurnock, Rudy began to climb out quickly, but became entangled in foul-smelling hides. Another and the strongest resistance on the way to freedom he met from the side of Migurnock. Not as big as Vuggo’s, but with equal strength, Migurnók’s arm turned into an insurmountable barrier for Rudy.
- Don't run away from me, – quietly said giant, – you must beat the habit of making up things that can’t be, blindly believe it and fear the ghost your mind created.
- I don’t understand what you’re talking about.
- Honestly, I don’t realize too. But you stay here anyway. I wouldn’t want all the attention of my brothers to be in my direction because of you. Don’t forget, I’m not here.
Chapter 8. Dreams
- It’s inexplicably, but the fear, the anxiety, the frustration and all the bad feelings disappear instantly when you’re near Migurnock, – said Ulligrassor, who quietly snuck up to Rudy.
Before answering to Ulligrassor, Rudy looked at Migurnock, who skillfully pretended to be asleep. His face was kind and happy. Apparently, he imagined extraordinary and unknown world of his delightful dreams.
- You’re a quick learner of the good. Maybe you can figure out his secret. I still don’t understand why I’m so comfortable near him.
- Maybe, – answered Rudy, – he just doesn’t stop you from feeling comfortable and calm. Maybe he doesn’t expect anything from us.
- You may be right, but it’s not so sure, – said Ulligrassor and then he clumsily fell near them.
Now Rudy lay between two giants and did not know what he could expect from each of them. The only question in his mind was: “Why did you come here?”, which was more of a mute reproach to Ulligrassor. During his time with him, Rudy was feeling himself the victim of long conversations from which caused he lost his sanity.
- Sorry, my friend, but I’m not here to talk. If you don’t mind, I’ll lie here quietly for a while, – said Ulligrassor with own guilt.
- Quietly? – Rudy was surprised.
Ulligrassor nodded in the affirmative. Not for the first time, he found his calm near Migurnock and feeling the space of peace where he could freely indulge in dreams. The joy of the conditional gaining of the impossible extinguished the flame of his restless nature, and he went silent by out of desire that animated came alive for a brief moment. The power of his imagination was indeed great, and if he had the power and knowledge that his Father was famous for, he would have been able to create a new world. The beauty of his visions was unrealistic, but he was often caught up in a deceptively delusion of his fantasy and he believed that it was real. Ulligrassor always said that the time given to dreams he valued more than the time spent on life itself, but unlike Migournock, he did not want to escape into his wonderful dreams forever.
Rudy could have competed with Ulligrassor to fantastic imagination. As a child, when he has been alone for a long time, Rudy replaced the stranglehold feeling of his isolation with fantastic stories in which he was the main character. The stories he made up were always started from one point, but day after day, they had an interesting development. At some point, he lost control of what his mind offered him. The lines of his fantasies became closely intertwined with the lines of life, with the difference being that the fantastic Rudy conquered all the things to which the real Rudy suffered the crushing defeat. This led the real world to lose the real Rudy, and in a fantastic world, there was only a fantastic Rudy.
- What’s like your world? – breaking the silence, asked Ulligrassor.
It was the first time in his life that Rudy had answered sincerely. Aurora had asked him that question more than once. He invariably answered in no the way he thought, but merely reluctantly repeated comfortable and correct phrases to others. Now he wanted to take responsibility for himself and his view. He said:
- My world is false. It’s one big, endless war where the rules of the game, mind you, not the lives, only the game’s, change rapidly, depending on the dominant moods of idiots like me. Without being able to know, of what is being imposed on us or even try a little bit to all of that, we have new conditions that we still cannot deal with. It’s like we’re blind, we’re traveling helplessly through time, bumping into each other. We don’t believe that we’re good and we don’t want to believe that we’re bad, but we don’t really have anything good or anything bad. We have great opportunities and even greater risks at our disposal. Beauty has gone from quality to quantity. The life stance has gone from value to cost. In the old days, we were proud of our conscience, but now we prefer to hide it. Compromise is a vice, not a virtue. Goodness is not a power, but a weakness. All of what we can imagine having a price, but it’s so high that the best is available to the worst of people. The whole world ruled by bad people. It’s because bad people have no dignity and have no other choice but to take the most important levers of rule into their own hands and create a reality fit for themselves... bad reality. And so, in general, my world is good. There are many beautiful places. Nature is much more diverse than here. You can’t imagine how much beauty outside of Laldiroff. And the food is delicious there.
After hearing this, Ulligrassor laughed. And he said:
- You’re listening to Silgur and Muniard too much. For soon, you’ll sit with them the third wise man. You will frighten us with monstrous truths about a past that can never be returned, a present in which nothing changes, and a future that may not happen. It’s no use, but it’s important.
- Now I understand, why your brothers hate you! – Rudy got mad.
After hearing this, Migurnock couldn’t stop laughing. In a most ludicrous way, he revealed to Ulligrassor his secret, which from the outside seemed a foolish lie. He had to explain himself to his brother, but none of them noticed Vuggo sneaked up on their company.
Chapter 9. Strife
“I despise all of you!”, – screamed Vuggo just like an animal. The first to be hit by his anger was Migurnock. Vuggo attacked his hated brother, like a feral predator who had caught his prey. As fierce and merciless as ever, he did not respond to Silgur’s and Muniard’s pleas to stop. Gallagud’s angry orders also had no power over him. Rudy, who was near Migurnock and did not dare to move, was brutally thrown aside in the first moments of the contraction. Immobilized after a painful blow to the big stones that Vuggo threatened to throw at him and Ulligrassor, he watched passively for the whole thing.
Having finished with Migurnock, Vuggo rushed to attack Ulligrassor, but Ulligrassor was so quick and cunning that he had to be chased. For a seasoned hunter, the chase was a common occurrence, and their Father Aliel measured a lot less force to Ulligrassor, so eventually he was caught. But unlike Vuggo, Ulligrassor had a far greater gift from the Father – a desire and skill not to give up. Outpacing of his brother’s merciless blow, he was able to stop the inevitable by a simple question:
- Why?!
Vuggo’s wrath was unstoppable. He screamed:
- We are all equal before the Father and the world, and we are equally blessed. So why is the difference in our contribution so greatly and unfair?! While some create, wrestle and bring booty, others only allow themselves rest and forbidden escape into oblivion!
- You can’t judge us or punish us! – Ulligrassor shouted in the hope that his words would be heard and supported by the wise brothers, and Gallagud.
- I will judge and punish you, because our existence rests on my shoulders! I am paving our way home, and I am feeding us! And what are you doing, you filthy weasel?! What is your benefit to us if you are useless even to yourself?! If I were you, I’d be ashamed of my helplessness, not acknowledge it, absolving myself of the heavy responsibility!
- You are well aware, my brother, that I have sufficient hunting and tracking skills, my wisdom and knowledge are not inferior to the wisdom and knowledge of Silgur and Muniard, I can say the right words like Wurn, and Migurnock taught me to make some useful potions! All of you know about it, but you won’t accept me for who I am! I am not allowed to be necessary and helpful, because all important duties are shared between you, and it is only Raron and I who do not serve the common good, because Father did not tell us what is our personal power and what we live for. So why am I the only one you can blame?! Why is Raron worthy of your respect?! Why is he better than me?! Why am I worse than him?! Why did Migurnock suffer of you?! He faithfully fulfills his duty to the Father and all of us! You set an example of what you have and you are mercilessly ashamed of me and Migurnock for we have! Who gave you the rights of Aliel at this moment?! Aren’t you afraid of his wrath by doing injustice to us?!
- I knew you wouldn’t miss the opportunity to hide behind the name of our Father! – responded Vuggo, and began to attack Ulligrassor.
With the ferocious anger he had accumulated over the years, he began to strangle his brother.
- Leave him, Vuggo! – said Gallagud.
- I can’t! – Vuggo answered honestly.
- Killing him you killing my respect for you! But that’s not the worst part! Killing him you killing Aliel’s love for you, and maybe for all of us!
Unable to understand what was happening, Rudy was stunned with horror. The feeling of self-helplessness and uselessness created a cold fear that Rudy had struggled with since his early childhood. He was cold to the extent that his life lost all interest in him, without giving him inner warmth. The cursed fear has once again come too close to Rudy’s vulnerable nature what was the hidden and unknown to the others. His consciousness and strength were gone, but no one had ever cared before.
Meanwhile, Ulligrassor continued to be at risk. Vuggo has sent a firmly message to others that their appeals, requests and orders have no power over him, and that the strength of his hatred far exceeds the strength of any reason, even the wisest one, to stop him.
- What do you propose we do? How are we supposed to continue going to our way? How are we going to overcome the dangers and the insidious tricks that we encounter at almost every turn if we pose a threat to one another? – Muniard asked.
Appeals, requests, and orders had no power over Vuggo, but the underestimated power of the reproach immediately broke his resolve. His touchy was the most fearsome and merciless enemy for him, under whose pressure he could rarely withstand. Muniard had long been aware of this, and he took advantage of his knowledge and wisdom, which turned out to be quite insidious. Defeated and humiliated in front of the unworthy, Vuggo freed Ulligrassor.
When Vuggo approached Muniard, he said with bitterness:
- Every moment of our endless journey, I have striven and tried to be of service to each and every one of you. Even now, I’m willing to sacrifice myself if it’s necessary for you to make you found our house. I haven’t rest that you had. I haven’t serenity that is bestowed upon you. I’m very tired, but I keep trying. All what you said killed me.
- You blame me for the truth.
- No. I blame you for not wanting to admit the obvious.
- We are the same in this.
Vuggo was finally defeated, but he had to confront Muniard and everyone else in order to maintain his pride. He said:
- We’re about to meet the Gargonts, and you have as much to prepare for it as I do. Without wasting a moment here, I will leave immediately for the foraging for our wretched brothers. They are starving. This time, we must save them. For my part, I will do my best and I will spare no effort to do so.
And then he asked Migurnock:
- How can you help them?	
- Don’t think about me, – unwillingly answered Migurnock, by touching his broken head, – you, like anyone else, have no right to decide whether I’m useful or not.
- Not for the sake of my confession, but for the sake of your truth, be useful to at least your new friend, – said Vuggo and pointed at Rudy.
While the wanderers, who considered themselves brothers, were involved in a quarrel, pretending to be enemies to each other, Rudy was left alone with his own troubles. The cold and the fear, as it has always been, were stronger than him. When Vuggo turned his attention by Rudy, he was already neither dead nor alive.
Chapter 10. Searching
The pain it was totally alien of his nature, like a dashing beast trapped, who tried to break out of Slargart’s chest, without letting him rest. He could no longer tolerate the unbearable agony that seemed to be forever settled in his body, draining his strength and poisoning his mind. None of the brothers noticed how, day after day, his inner flame faded. No one even thought that the moment would come when Slargart would lose its essence and would no longer be able to lead the wanderers to home. This time has come, and they’ve missed it.
He left his brothers without doubt or regret. He had nowhere to go, but he knew where he wanted to be. The White Wasteland was drawing him. There, in a blinding trap, was a beautiful and dangerous woman he almost killed. From moment to moment, he imagined she’s glancing around with distraught, without finding shelter or protection, and little tear slid from her dark, night-like eyes. In his fantasy, he would follow her every uncertain step, walk the many miles of infinite uniformity in vain search of a way out.
“I have to be with her”, – he said to himself again and again. That phrase was a question and answer, a doubt and a statement – that’s depended on the current moment, and what Slargart was ready for at this point in time. Gradually, a firm conviction prevailed over anything that could make him change his mind and return to wanderers. Slargart did not intend to stop – he knew full well that sooner or later the ground beneath his feet would change and a dazzling white light would be a sign that he’s close to the desired moment.
The space around him seemed to be dying. The noise of the wind was somewhere far behind him. The last quiet sounds were seamlessly absorbed by the suffocating silence. The cold air felt like ice chains. When Slargart entered the Wunyagun Belt, he encountered severe resistance from the high-density cold that repulsed him back. Unwilling to return to where from he had fled so desperately, Slargart stubbornly and patiently made his way through the invisible force tearing apart his dome. When the defence of his eternal sanctuary refuge was breached, Slargart was fully feeling the animosity from the force of nature against which he hastily opposed. The thousands of small pieces of ice that were the invisible wall between him and his goal injured Slargart’s face to the blood. In order to move forward, he had to make a sharp tug through the hypereffort, then another, and it was unknown how many equally debilitating tugs he needed to make. The meaning of these actions dissipated every time he tried again. Having lost the ability to see, walk and breathe, Slargart surrendered and allowed himself to fall, voluntarily giving himself up to death.
The false hope triumphed over him. From false hope, he was truly joyous. The death he wanted was so close, but so far away. Their Father gave them more than they could count on, but he was making death impossible for them. Slargart remembered this, losing the joy and false hope in one ill-fated but honest moment. It made no sense to wait for radical liberation for him.
He thought that somewhere outside the Wunyagun Belt, there could be a White Wasteland. By taming the chaotic stream of his thoughts, Slargart thought that the surrounding space could deceive him, and the Wunyagun Belt could be the White Wasteland trap. That thought was so strong that he immediately believed it.
He was tormented by contradictions, but he still had hope. The White Wasteland was Aliel’s first creation, and in its limits the death had a chance to catch up with Slargart. The little bit of his patience and he could count on the hoped-for freedom from the unbearable burden of his own existence. On the other hand, he wanted to meet once again that enchanting woman who had deprived him of his sanity and peace, and take her out of the White Wasteland, not knowing or understanding why.
His desire for death was weaker. He wanted to touch a beautiful woman, look her sad eyes, and perhaps hear her voice. His Father gave him the unthinkable opportunities, which was inaccessible to the usual mortal people, but Aliel's son could not count on meeting and staying with the one who had power over Slargart’s deepest feelings and restless thoughts. The wanderers had to live in isolation and be alone. Against the will of the Father, Slargart found a woman he could no longer forget, but even if a second miracle had happened and she had followed him, there would be no refuge for them in all of Laldiroff.
Slargart did not want to think about the future. With the last of his powers, he was able to overcome the hardest obstacle and get out of the ill-fated Wunyagun Belt. He had to pass great distances and cross the rough edges in which wanderers had never been. He had to endure violent storms and climb out of the deadly traps that were almost at every turn, created by the hostile nature of the places. He lost all what was left of his pure mind on the way to what he wanted. That’s when died the great tracker, the pride of Aliel and the glorious brother of the eternal wanderers. Slargart enslaved by illusion which led him in a vicious circle.
And he’d been in a vicious circle forever, if the White Wasteland hadn’t brought in his way. After a few miles that he passed in the blinding snow-white space, Slargart’s spirit came to life. When everything around him merged in the miracle light and the white dust settled peacefully under his feet, he turned around with hope. To the East, near the horizon, there was a steep rock. The sharp peak of it, like a mirror that repels the sunlight, was shining with bizarre lights. The closer he got to the rock, the weaker the mysterious glare got, but there was a man up there.
“It’s her!”, – Slargart was excited.
Climbing to the peak sent Slargart new challenges. The rock’s surface was unstable. Before climbing a few precious meters, he was falling down like a stone, but always miraculously grasped at reliable protrusions. His determination was invincible, and his desire to be on top gave him strength. At the site of his climb, there were blood prints, as a mark of will available which not even the highest of spirits.
His will, his expectations and his hopes had no meaning, in which Slargart invested so hard. There was no one at the peak. He was the first to set foot on crystal-clear snow, which was fluttering with bright colors and throwing out bizarre glare, which so enticed the occasional wanderer. And no one before him couldn’t be in that space which was, in fact, a momentary illusion of the White Wasteland.
She wasn’t there – it was just his pain.
The altitude revealed stunning views of the obviously non-existent in reality. Slargart looked with regret the all space of the White Wasteland without finding who he was looking for. He had to face the bitter truth that his fate was the eternal ordeal for which he and his brothers were coming to this world. He was no longer able to carry out Aliel’s will. The will to die was stronger.
After begging the Father’s forgiveness, Slargart hastily rushed down from the rock, for even under the influence of the most intense illusion, he knew that Aliel would answered him. He didn’t wait, because he knew – the Father will forbid him to do it.
Chapter 11. Despair
“The Spirit, who from the void is freed,
The One who created Himself,
The One who sent us on an eternal journey,
The Great Beginnings Creator,
The Ruler of life and death,
The Master of the fate,
You are justice and order!
My Father, Aliel,
Look at me!
And forgive me for asking You now,
And forgive me for breaking Your peace!”
Vuggo’s appeal sounded fierce. He always spoke to his Father one-on-one. Aliel responded to his requests, giving everything his son needed. None of Vuggo’s brothers could communicate with the Father, so openly and summon Aliel at any time.
Vuggo was keeping his special secret. On his way to hunting, he was actually going as far away from everyone as possible and hid in the most secret places in Laldiroff, so that for a short moment he could be alone with the Father and ask for meal for himself and his brothers. The glorious hunter last captured and killed a living creature long time ago. That was when they beginning of their journey, when the wander were opened up them new horizons, and the wanderers themselves were quite different.
One day, when they faced famine, Vuggo and Migurnock, after giving the rest of they had to their brothers, went to find a meal. Wandering through the wastelands, they found nothing that could defeat the famine. It seemed that everything within Laldiroff had died and only the wanderers, devoid of death, had in vain suffered without the Father’s attention and support. The endless displacement of the lands of Laldiroff kept alienating settlements from them, from which the wanderers could ask for help. After experiencing every possible, conceivable and unthinkable attempt to break through, Vuggo fell into despair. That’s when their quarrel with Migurnock took place, after that, they could not reconcile.
After abandoning his brother, Vuggo walked for several days without stopping. He didn’t know what to do next. Suddenly, on his way, he saw a huge gray boulder. It was biggest by the standards of Laldiroff, and the centuries-old struggle with the forces of nature left in it the mark in the form of a small cave. Even the biggest giant could have hidden there. In this cave, for the first time Vuggo appealed to Aliel for help. Crying like a baby, he asked the Father to give them a meal. Over and over again, he repeated the words of his request until he lost consciousness. That's when, for the first time, Aliel responded him and sent the venison to his children. The nine deer carcasses were stacked next to the cave. It was a true miracle. There were never deer in those places. When his strengths returned, Vuggo decided to leave his refuge and return to his brothers with nothing. By then, he lost last hope. Upon seeing the Father’s gift, he took back his belief that they would come out of an excruciating trap and find their lost way home. Since then, Vuggo has stopped hunting. He was getting food through desperate appeals to Aliel, who has always heard him.
After finding the seclusion between the temporary refuge of the wanderers and the settlement of the Gargonts, Vuggo started to ask the Father for help not only for him and his brothers, but also for those who were the same children of Aliel. They were the children, who refused to obey the will of the Father. The Gargonts appeared in the lands of Laldiroff long before Vuggo and his brothers. They were the first wanderers to whom the Father given less patient, but measured far more free will than his next children. The long and exhausting journey has awakened in them a debilitating sense of defiance and rejection of Aliel. Their Father did not hold them, and left his children who disobeyed him without his support in the place where they cursed him. So the Gargonts found themselves abandoned in places unfit for decent living, having only what was their natural – that is, nothing.
Calling for Father’s support, Vuggo waited patiently for a response. Aliel was silent. Nothing showed the presence of Great Spirit beside him.
“Father, hear me now!”, – called Vuggo again, – “Don’t leave me without your love! Behold the great wound of my fallen spirit! Feel my insufferable pain! Accept my tears as proof of the truth! The hope left me, taking my powers and will! Don’t leave me in the misery that destroys me just like water destroying the Luiggnor glacier! I’m perishing like Luiggnor! If thy wrath against the Gargonts is unyielding, then give the meal to me and my brothers! Don’t let them see my humiliation!”.
Aliel did not answer. In bitter despair, Vuggo cried and in hysterical pleas for the third time appealed to the Father:
“If I deserve your anger, please, don’t turn away from my brothers! Give a meal to them! I won’t touch what you give them!”.
Aliel did not answer.
Leaving all his hopes, Vuggo returned to his brothers. He didn’t know what he was going to say to them, but he knew what he should have to tell the truth, especially after making a big promise. He was ready to reveal a special secret kept from everyone and expose his false image as punishment for his misdeeds, unknown to him, that had turned the Father away from him.
But a sudden miracle saved him from the impending shame. Near their temporary shelter, he saw torn up pieces of meat divided into fair shares. To the surprise for Vuggo, there was the share for him.
Chapter 12. Truth
- We are doomed, – said Vuggo through tears.
That was the last time he hugged his beloved brother, with whom they shared both joy and sorrow through years and events.
Migurnock suffered as much as Vuggo did, but he was able to maintain his lively and cheerful disposition. He decided to fight the melancholy that caught the two of them in his own way. His meagre reserves contained some of that wonderful potion. By drinking it, they could have immediately and for a long time being in oblivion. Out of respect, he offered a Vuggo first sip.
- You're tired, – he said quietly, – it’ll help you find your strength where everything is abundant.
Vuggo rejected his brother’s offer. Unlike the others, he went into oblivion only once, after which he was ashamed and he despised himself for having shown weakness by succumbing to temptation. He angrily condemned all of those who went there without a doubt, and wished them the severe punishment from Aliel.
- How dare you offer me that? – asked Vuggo with wrath.
- Trust me, you need to be there now, not here, – calmly answered Migurnock.
- You insult me!
- Your fear speaks for you. Let me rid you of everything that destroys you. We have become vulnerable. We need to hide in a place where no evil, no sadness, no danger will find us, and where we will heal in deep peace.
- And leave our brothers in trouble when they need my help?! I’m strong enough to get us all out of this trap, whatever it takes for me!
- No one needs your help. Your efforts mean nothing.
Having said these cruel words to his brother, Migurnock was unwillingly sowed a seed of enmity between them. The only thing that mattered to Vuggo was the value of his life and his actions. This was the main driving force behind his existence. Accidentally and recklessly devaluing his brother’s aspirations, Migurnock lost a faithful friend by having received in return Vuggo as the worst enemy, who, since the moment of their disagreement, for centuries, has kept him at bay.
Vuggo often rejected the truth. Over time, the truth began to bypass him, passing him under to the protection of painful fantasy.
He did not know that his first request to Aliel had been heard by Migurnock. Feeling guilty to his brother, he followed Vuggo to find the right moment to reconcile them. Hearing the bitter cries and heartbreaking pleas of his brother, he gained an insight from the Father, it which turned in a different direction the dreadful story of their dangerous situation.
It was a mystery to everyone how Migurnock was able to obtain all the necessary herbs, roots, fruits and unknown ingredients from which he brewed his amazing potions. The truth was known only to Migurnock and Aliel. The Father gave him secret knowledge and the very first drink, thanks to which it the spirit of Migurnock could for a time leave the body and inhabit into the living thing he had chosen, and if he not exhausted of his strengths, he could have created any living form.
For the first time, he found an extraordinary refuge in the body of a decrepit old woman from a small settlement far outside Laldiroff. At that time, Migurnock lacked the necessary skills and experience to wisely seize the moment. His mind did not cloud the mind of old woman’s. His will did not repress the old woman’s will. It was his first and last mistake.
The decrepit old woman was far more powerful than any opponent he knew. She was the only one of the ordinary people in that land who possessed knowledge that had been hidden from the rest of others for centuries, and she didn’t act in a good way. Of all the neighborhoods where her name was mentioned, the grim sufferers flocked to ask for her help. Galga always gave what people asked her, but no one knew that in return, she took everything else away from them, leaving only what they came for. More often than not, the losses were of disproportionate value of what they had received, and people were forever left with what they found was not needed to them later. The rare brave ones, who loudly lamented their lost, acknowledged their stupidity, which brought them to Galga’s doorstep. They wished to shield from the same mistake those who intended to go to the witch, but the grim sufferers did not hear the sobs of others. By despair they lined up in long queues to an old woman who performed astounding miracles.
Galga immediately realized that a mind unknown to her had penetrated her mind. Angered by the peculiar audacity of the parasite, she plunged into a deep state of temporary stopover of life to enter the sacral, only accessible place for her, and banish from the halls of her mind the unwelcome guest.
- Who the hell are you?! – asked Galga, when she was trying to catch Migurnock.
With little experience of self-defense, and only knowing the dangers from the stories of Vuggo and Slargart, Migurnock said his name, believing that honesty and openness would spare him unnecessary conflict with the old woman in whose body he had found an accidental refuge.
After he said his name, Migurnock felt a powerful, instantly disempowering suffocation. For the first time, he felt the sacrament of dying.
- Don't do it! – that was the voice of Aliel, – That’s my son and you can’t kill him!
Galga stopped. The fatal suffocation released Migurnock, but he was too weak to do anything. The Father spoke for him.
- Go to the Dark Deep and gather everything he need!
Following Aliel’s orders, Galga ran to do what the Great Spirit told her. She cast a spell of numbness on grim sufferers who would follow her wherever she went. Then the old woman headed for the ancient forest where the true friends of her dark spirit lived. Laughing at her, they led Galga to Dark Deep and showed her the most precious gifts of that terrible place.
Galga humbly obeyed Aliel’s command without asking for anything in return. For the needs of Migurnock, she tore off the twigs with immature berries of suimors, picked fallen leaves of the vigurnian bush and dug up a whole tangle of bitter mavrerry roots. She left all of this on the stump of the grey tree.
As soon as Galga had done her mission, the spirit of Migurnock left her and inhabit into a young polar owl it sitting on a twig of a nearby tree.
- Take all that Galga’s collected and fly to Laldiroff! – ordered Aliel.
Migurnock thought the Father was referring to the bird, but the order was given to him. It took him a long time to realize that the moment had come when everything depended on his actions.
He realized that in order to rule an owl, he had to imagine himself as an owl, and all of his being had to believe it. The second point was the hardest. Getting used to the idea that he was an owl, Migurnock was wasting precious time. The berries of suimors and leaves of the vigurnian bush were quickly withered. The faith gave Migurnock nothing.
Instead of faith, his main and powerful impulse to move was the desire to return to his body as soon as possible. This desire gave him great power to rule the bird. Then Migurnock realized that by interacting with another living being, he can control it, if he used his own power and hard pressure.
An owl under his control, grabbed what was left by Galga, and like an arrow flew northwest. When Migurnock looked down on those locations, he was amazed. The all outside Laldiroff was different. Much more interesting. Much more beautiful. Much better. However, he gladly returned to his native land. Migurnock realized that no matter how far he wouldn’t have ended up, he would know the way to the home and would surely find Laldiroff.
In the southeast coast of Laldiroff, near the Gungs settlement, the owl washed up everything left of the suimor, vigurnian and mavrerry. Once at home, Migurnock freed the bird from his spirit and inhabit into the white bear, which was very close, and clumsy hunting for a nimble seal.
With no time to waste, Migurnock decisively took control of the bear. So he reached a close but safe distance to the brothers and delivered the wild berries, roots and leaves with which he could create his potion. Having hidden the recovered goods in a secluded place, Migurnock finally returned to his body.
Over time, he found the much more diverse plants, berries and herbs. The animals he controlled could have taken him far beyond the northern terrain. In one such journey, he first felt the warmth of the air itself. It did not seem as pleasant as the heat from the fire, but when he returned home, Migurnock again and again remembered a strange feeling for which he was not ready.
One day, hearing the bitter cries of Vuggo and his heartbreaking prayers addressed to Aliel, Migurnock gained an insight from the Father that fundamentally changed the history of their endless journey.
Using the opportunities given to him, Migurnock decided to become a breadwinner, replacing his brother. His spirit inhabit into the deer leader who led a small herd of reindeer into a slippery hollow, where they fell into an imminent death trap. Leaving the defenseless reindeer in a dangerous position, the strong spirit of Migurnock had by then created his first and his favorite living form. It was a huge black wolf, with the strength of a bear and the speed of a snow leopard. This wolf was the true hunter who fed the wanderers. It was this wolf who Vuggo tried to kill years later. That was the truth.
Having made his brother happy, Migurnock hoped for a reconciliation that would return them to their former friendship with Vuggo, but this did not happen. At the first meeting, Vuggo attacked him and nearly killed him in front of his brothers.
- Why do you hate Migurnock so much? – asked Gallagud.
- He doesn’t belong with us! He is unworthy of a tiny fraction of your respect even! He is unworthy of our love!
- Why? – asked Wurn.
- Migurnock is a pest! I was finally convinced of that as soon as we faced trouble! Instead of helping, he was always offering his crappy drink, and confusing us!
- Can you say with any certainty that Migurnock has harmed you? – asked Silgur.
- I can’t! But I’m sure he’s a pest!
- All I see right now is your great and ugly-ass grudge, and it makes me sad, – said Muniard, – we all have pride and get along well with it, and your you let your pride rule you.
- Now I don’t see you as a loving brother! – Vuggo got angry, – Your wisdom has yielded to denial. Today, you turn a blind eye to your brother’s madness, and tomorrow, your brother, that you're protecting, will ruthlessly cut your eyes it were blinded by trusted!
Muniard smiled ironically. And then he said:
- I can get this execution from you, but it’s not from Migurnock.
The brothers all turned out to be Vuggo’s opponents in a crucial dispute for him. The conflict was gaining momentum. Wanting to get what he wanted, he dragged into a discord everyone except Raron. The brothers had nothing to do with his quarrel with Migurnock, but each of them wished to state their views on the matter.
Unlike Migurnock, Vuggo needed support. His gut has long withered and demanded the life-giving nourishment through of approval and acceptance of his position, but the brothers betrayed his trust by siding with his new enemy. Unable to endure the humiliation, and the betrayal of those he had so blindly trusted, Vuggo broke out of the circle of traitors, in the inexhaustible quest to run away by an unknown destiny in the future. He wished to escape murderous frustration.
Raron stopped him. He was decisive and he said to Vuggo:
- You can’t hide from us your insatiable thirst for the unconditional love of all without exception, but it’s never gonna happen. Until recently, we were very friendly, and we were all very happy with the kind company that Aliel gave us. Nine brothers, we love and protect each other, we could have goes peacefully to our home. Shoulder to shoulder. Without quarrels. Without veiled grievances. But it doesn’t happen, and it doesn’t have to be. Just because it doesn’t have to. We have accepted it, but you’re resisting and torturing yourself. In the vain of resisting to inconvenient existence which you don’t accept, out of a petty sense of vengeance, you’re trying to hurt one of us, most often by being a jerk, and each time it doesn’t sense. But you’re not going to get anywhere with your aggressive actions. Even if you want the new circumstances, the fact of being will be the same. Now Migurnock knows he’s only loved by seven brothers, but you’re deluded that eight brothers don’t love you. Love or its absence doesn’t affect the course of events – it is we who push them, most often, into the abyss. Fall into the abyss, or stay out of it, you don’t change the fact of being. The time replaces the time, but the important thing is, as always, it stays intact. You can’t be loved by everyone you meet in your life. Even Aliel’s Forefather, the Creator and Keeper of the existence, did not reserve the right to be loved and recognized by all. He gave up the obvious good to be equal to each and every one of us. He created a burden of unrequited love so we wouldn’t forget who we are.
Chapter 13. Forgiveness
- You forgot who you are, – said Raron, leaning over Slargart’s body.
No one else noticed their brother’s disappearance. Everyone focused on their own concerns: someone dreamed, someone suffered, someone looked back to the past, someone was thinking about the future. Raron gave no weight to any word, any event, any phenomenon or single life, but Slargart’s quiet departure he could not accept indifferently.
Raron decisively overcame the challenges of the Wunyagun Belt, following in the footsteps of his brother. He has passed the horrors of the cold and the trap of the icy Wunyagun space. Unlike Slargart, Raron did not think about life and death – his inner spirit exceeded the power of any obstacle. He was ready for anything, and he took anything for granted, because nothing really made sense to him.
When he reached place, where the White Wasteland was a few moments earlier, he found his brother. Defeated and miserable, Slargart lay in the middle of a gray plain. Death took the strongest son of Aliel, leaving the dead body of a poor, wounded, ordinary man whose face was disfigured by grief. Even the calm and insensitive Raron could not long look at it. Being honest with himself, he realized that Slargart’s death had caused him to feel bitterness, resentment, anger, and even hatred for his brother. For the first time, he couldn’t change anything.
Finding a safe way around the Wunyagun Belt, Raron returned to his brothers with sad news. This was their first loss, which they didn’t want, but they were forced to accept. Their faith has been shaken. Their immortality was in doubt. Their aspirations have lost driving force.
One of Aliel’s main tenets, to which they had adhered since their very inception, now concerned wanderers themselves. The sons of Great Spirit were not looking for the meaning of anything, but as it turned out, internally they expected that their existence made true sense. Immortality was the eternal guarantor of the reality of their expectations. Slargart went beyond their conditional existence. Slargart did a thing, that no one of their dared to do. Slargart got what each of them secretly dreamed of.
The wanderers went to the place of Slargart’s death to bid farewell to their brother and to see with their own eyes the proof of their vulnerability. Rudy went with them.
Throughout the way they were surrounded by a cold silence. That journey was long, but none of the wanderers noticed the time that they lost. It’s as if there wasn’t a great distance between them and a place where Slargart went and where he find death. He seemed to have died very close, in the moment when they all turned their backs against him, and each one in their looked to own direction.
They found the most precious thing, the one that was so unreasonably lost by them. They found something they couldn’t bring back. Stay around Slargart’s body, the wanderers fell to their knees. Hesitating to enter into their circle, Rudy remained on the sidelines. He listened to the farewell speeches of the wanderers, and what he heard it made him hate their values.
- I forgive you for you’re not always being honest with me, – said Gallagud with a disappointed, – and after what you’ve done, looking back, I have a doubt about everything. Now I ask myself: “What if all this time he was leading us in the wrong places?”. And I have no answer. This is one of the scariest discovery of late. We didn’t expect you to do this, and only the Father alone knows what you left behind. Maybe we shouldn’t have trusted you. Maybe I’m wrong now. But I forgive you for everything I know and I forgive you for everything I’ll never know.
- I forgive you for your taking away your help for us forever, – said Wurn with anger, – each and every one of us bears equally the burden placed on our shoulders. It was no more difficult for you than it was for me and the other brothers. Each of us obeys the will of the Father, though I myself have often doubted that we would come, find, and get. We are not stronger than you. You are not weaker than us. I forgive you for the mistake that got the better of you.
- I forgive you for you never notice me. I guess you were a good brother. I hope you were, but I can’t believe it. For no reasonable reason, you rejected me, and stripped me of your support, but for that I forgave you a long time ago, – said Ulligrassor in dismay.
- I forgive you for your cowardice during the famine, when you did not join me and Migurnock and waited with the others for our return. I also forgive you for not thanking me for the opportunity to feed on a meal that I sourced so hard. And I forgive you for your leaving me now, – said Vuggo with contempt.
- I forgive you for you never consulted me. I could have answered all your questions. Now those answerers gonna stay with me forever. You left me a burden that you didn’t dare carry on your own. Knowing more than you, I must forgive you for something you didn’t know, – mysteriously said Silgur.
- I forgive you for your believing in things you shouldn’t have believed and I forgive you for your disbelief in things you should have believed. Now you won’t be able to forgive yourself for the torment you’ve called for yourself. I’ll do it for you. You’re forgiven, – severely said Muniard.
- I forgive you for you never been a close friend to me. My heart has always been open for you, but all you wanted from me it was my potion by which you got lost between reality and the place where your dreams existed. You’re not the only one who became addicted to being into oblivion and you deserve to be forgiven, – said Migurnock with sad.
- I forgive you, – said Raron indifferently.
- Forgive me for I couldn't see your grief, – said Rudy with sincere remorse, – I was there for you, but I wasn’t close to you. I could look at you more carefully and see what was broke your power. I could find the words you needed, but I didn’t do it. Now, this is the first time I’ve come to you, not with a request, but with a kind word, but you can’t hear me. I could have shown you that you’re not alone, but instead I was completely immersed in my own sadness. I’m sorry that your life didn’t matter to me.
After raising his eyes, Rudy saw the wanderers which looked at him with surprised and perplexity. He’s been in this position before. It was a long time ago and that old story was traumatic for him. While reliving his own emotional vulnerability, he lost his temper and aggressively made his point:
- When I saw all of you in a first time, I thought there was no one smarter in the world than you, but now all I see is your inhuman stupidity.
He expected the wanderers to destroy him for such insolent speech. Subconsciously, he provoked them to slaughter him, because the ever new moments could have given him events or ordeals for which he was no longer ready.
The wanderers didn’t respond him. They went up and carefully putting Slargart’s belongings next to his body. Then they put the dome over the deceased. They hid their brother forever from the world that he rejected.
Vuggo was finished the farewell ritual. In a disturbing hurry, he pulled out the stones belonging to Slargart. He turned away from the others and began to make sparks. A short moment later, a small fire appeared, from which a high flame soon burst, engulfing the dome.
Unable to bear the burden of his own importance, the mighty son of the Great Spirit Aliel disappeared forever. His ashes scattered on all sides within Laldiroff.
Chapter 14. Warning
- In the world, to which you belong, – said Silgur with sadness, and he addressed his mysterious message to Rudy, – a lot of you are caught up in an old delusion based on the fervent conviction of a few unknown people whom have never seen each other. People believe that consciousness is eternal. The mysteriously united by their inner need to affirm the high, near-divine, meaning of their existence, the unknown people came to a single and initially false explain that allowed them to accept their own life and death. The belief that human is valuable in life and in the aftermath of death allows human beings a lot of things, but the most important of opportunities is necessarily postponed to a hopeful future. In the present, human experiences no always peaceful transitions from desire to desire. I don’t say that they made the wrong choice. The desire itself is wonderful. It is the gift of life and a sure sign that human is still alive. A terrible desire can be made by putting in it content taken from the source of one’s soul. What is the value of a mind searching endlessly for desirable cases, ways, possibilities and moments? Death provides an honest, though cruel, answer to this question. Death, just like life, determines what is in the future and what should remain in the past. Consciousness doesn’t l eternal.
- I can’t understand you, – honestly said Rudy.
For a short moment, he gained his freedom from a heavy and interminable conversation with Silgur, who for unknown reasons considered Rudy a worthy companion. Ever since they had left Slargart, on the dreary journey to the Gargonts, Silgur walked beside Rudy, ignoring his eternal companion Muniard.
The conversation with Silgur, and even Silgur’s voice, caused Rudy to feel an unknown painful state in his body and mind and this condition was growing manner, but the silence possessed the mystical healing property of instantaneous action.
The silence allowed him to see the new, which seemed truly strange in the infinite monotony of Laldiroff. Hundreds of ancient ships that over which time and space had no power. The great ships were everywhere at the lifeless white expanse all the way to the horizon. And it was not clear how these majestic ships got so far from the shore, preserving their almost pristine appearance. Rudy wanted to ask Silgur why he was seeing things that he couldn’t understand, but stopped himself, worrying that he couldn’t handle a reasonable answer. However, he could not escape reasonable answers.
- The delusion of the unknown people was close to the truth, – Silgur spoke again, – probably, they didn’t need the truth, unless they took a few steps in the right direction to get to it.
- I can’t understand you, – desperately repeated Rudy.
- The creative power of consciousness leaves in eternity, but not forever, a priceless and inexplicable creation that rightfully belongs to the human. Everyone can feel like a god by creating what the world needs. And then the blindly gathered misconception and the itchy vanity those leaves the man, leaving him alone with the true reality of the creator. The joke is to create something complex and valuable out of the void. The part by part won’t come from a short flash of desire. The part by part is extracted by the creator from himself. This is a conscious victim. It is a courageous and genuinely accepted of the creator pain that saps faith by the string of misfortunes and bitterness. It’s a ghost that can remain only a ghost, or miraculously become a unique element of eternity. The creator will die, but what he has created, however small, can remain and serve at a time when the creator’s name and life vanished into the distant past. Understand this and compare it to for which a human sacrifice himself and to what he dedicates his life to.
- Why are you telling me this?
- The mind will not be eternal. The mind doesn’t pass through the space of eternity like a draught.
- You also know about the draughts…
- I know a lot more than I’d like to.
- You chose a bad conversationalist. I don’t know anything about consciousness, and I don’t intend to know about it. I certainly don’t claim a place in eternity.
- I told you all this to warn you about what you’re going to have to face. You think you’ve already seen too many horrors and misfortunes in our common journey, but don’t fool yourself. Save that gift for a really hopeless moment.
- You mean the Gargonts?
- Yes, I mean about them.
- They’re harmless and unhappy. I had no idea they needed to be feared.
- The Gargonts live forever, but their consciousness died shortly after Aliel abandoned them. The spectacle in which living bodies carries a dead consciousness is truly frightening and can hurt too much your sensitive perception of reality. As long as you know it, but you can’t see it, you’re strong, but once you see what you just knew...
- … will I go mad?
- No.
- I die?
- No.
- Then you don’t have to worry. You could have just warned me that meeting the Gargonts won’t be easy for me. A few words on that would suffice.
- A few words are not enough for me.
Chapter 15. The Gargonts
Something strange, unnatural in those places, it was sticking out of the frozen ground. The distant and unknown awakened the wanderers to curiosity and a kind of liveliness. That was the quirky trunk of a dry tree. That was the only tree that Rudy had seen during his journey across the expanses of Laldiroff. The tree was shaped like an exhausted man. It was served as a tacit guide, reassuring wanderers because it was hopeful sign that they find the right way.
It was a creepy dead man with no visible signs of decomposition, just like there was nothing human left in him. This time, Rudy noted with indifference another confirmation of the fact that one visible phenomenon may be incomparably different in the eyes of those who look at it. Also, inadvertently, in himself, he discovered the habit of seeing the good by deceiving himself in the presence of the worst.
The dead man was frozen by sat down. His skinny back held him steady. No less strange was the lifeless body resisting the sudden gust of wind. The forces of nature raged with all their might, but that was not enough to undo the hopeless. It’s like he’s frozen in eternity, putting roots deep in the permafrost.
As he approached the dead man, Vuggo reached out and popped his hands loudly, first near the left cheek of the dead face and then near the right cheek. In the same instant, the dried-up, ugly face was terribly flinched, and then the dead man opened his eyes. Once again, Rudy was caught in a ploy of the visible, but not the comprehensible. That was his first encounter with the Gargont.
It was a creature like the one that lived in Rudy’s childhood nightmares. One of Aliel’s first children, the Gargont, seemed like a monstrous mistake of the Great Spirit. He was transparent and fragile, like an ailing leaf. His eyes bore a striking resemblance to deep and dark waters in which the grey ice pupil floated slowly. His gaze was cold and empty. His existence was clearly unnecessary, but he continued to live.
- It's me? – the Gargont asked slowly and powerlessness, when he looked at Vuggo.
- No, it’s me, – answered Vuggo.
- No, it doesn’t me? – the Gargont got confused.
- Yes, it’s me, – Vuggo confirmed.
Upon hearing this, the Gargont howled from apparently inhuman suffering.
- Why do you see me here and not there or elsewhere?
Answering to the Gargont was meaningless. Trusting Muniard with his own burden and dome, Vuggo decided to act immediately. He carefully picked the Gargont up and went to the northeast, where their miserable brothers existed in suffering. The wanderers followed them. This time, Rudy was one of the first. Surprisingly, but his powers were too much, and the path was no longer difficult for him. He watched the others from time to time. The wanderers were concerned. It was like as if they were mentally discussing something very important with each other – something that they found it difficult to accept unconditionally.
For the first time, a harsh and evil Vuggo seemed kind. He carried the Gargont with such awe, like he was hided his beloved child in his secure arms from the cruel world. Patiently listening to Gargont’s delusional speech, he tried to find the right answer to any question, but in time realized that the Gargont did not need any answers.
- There’s so much I want to say, but there’s nothing to say, – said the Gargont.
Vuggo smiled at him and tried to hide Gargont’s head under heavy fur so that he could calm down in the dark.
- Why can I talk if I don’t have the strength for it? – the Gargont’s delusional speech kept going, – Why do I know I can’t talk, and yet I’m talking?
When Rudy heard this, he was amazed. He had heard these strange questions a long time ago. Back then, it was when they were alone with Aurora. Hiding from the daily agony in the thick darkness Aurora’s little room, they lay near each other’s and silently, each on his own, they were wandering in the winding depths of their own desires. At that moment, Rudy wanted love and affection. The Aurora’s wishes were unknown to him. She said only: “Why can I talk if I don’t have the strength for it?”. Rudy hated such difficulties, and when he thought he had to deal with women’s stupidity one more time, he left Aurora.
Viewing what the Gargont had said as a sign from above, Rudy decided to learn the meaning of a seemingly silly question. When he approached Silgur, he asked:
- What is torturing this poor man?
Silgur looked at him as if Rudy had asked him to explain something elementary and known to the world. However, he did not leave the question unanswered. He said:
- Each living thing is sent a sufficient number of ordeals to determine the limits of its essence. No one and nothing are never getting more ordeals and suffers than can accept, but the trick is that no one knows the limits of their own essence. And human will never know how many ordeals defined for him or someone he worried about. So the human, only the human, begins to discover his own limits themselves and is always wrong. For example, one day your beloved woman loses faith in her own strengths, and she dies after a series of recurring ordeals. Faith is lost when you lost understanding of what is happening, and mainly you lost the awareness of your own fate, and when is not possible to find or come up with the necessary explanation about it.
- It’s not like it’s ever happened to me.
- Could it have happened to someone you love?
Rudy was confused. Unwittingly, he began to agree with that he stubbornly could not accept for many years. Remembering the last months and days of Aurora, he  admitted that all the while he had neglected the important signals and clues of his experiences, preferring not to notice of all that it in the near future with monstrous ruthlessness had overturned his life.
- Let us imagine that fate has determined twelve ordeals for her, – eagerly explained Silgur, – the ten of which she overcame at too hard. Over and over again, she seemed to lose all faith, but in the worst of times, everything changed, and then she had an unconditional victory for which she was not ready. Triumph is great and beautiful, but asserting personal power over one thing does not mean that strength is present in all. Weakness does not disappear. When her focus is fully just only by her strength, an adversary emerges that will find her weakness. And in the case of your beloved, the eleventh ordeal has challenged her violently, sending such an adversary against her. Wounded and broken, she meets the new challenge, armed only the certainty that she has the power to defeat. How can she fight if all she has is an encouraging illusion? The penultimate ordeal always comes to the one who is about to be wiped out. The new conditions push a man to surrender and concede defeat. Many people, who marred by fatigue, disbelief and sometimes distorted egoism, they offer no resistance in battle from which they can emerge victorious. Thus, having renounced themselves, their past, present and future, they stop at the last step before the final ordeal.
- I would stop too. If I can’t fight now, I wouldn’t torture myself to fight again in the future?
- That’s the thing, the last ordeal for her, you and everyone would be an ordeal of happiness. Those who have taken defeat without struggle are soon forced out of life. Some agree to leave. The stubborn ones are chased to death by force. They have no place in life, because they are not ready to move on. They are no longer capable of giving what is required of them.
- And what they have to do?
Silgur mysteriously smiled. He said:
- They are required to do what they are no longer capable of.
- Why does a human have to define the limits of his essence?
- It’s a necessary, but it doesn’t make sense. We have to accept that, with no doubt.
Rudy’s efforts were in vain. More than ever, he was listening Silgur closely, but Rudy understood almost nothing.
- I don’t understand your wise answer. I look at the Gargont and I see the empty, but it’s not death.
Once again, Silgur mysteriously smiled.
- By holding back your awkwardness, you asked the question, not about poor Gargont, but about the one whose image follows you. I gave you a hard but honest answer. Don’t lie to me and to yourself. You don’t care about the Gargonts. It’s your mistake. They can’t die, but the emptiness of their eternal existence is far more frightening and painful than death. Their destiny to make us aware of the value of everything we gain by coming into this world with nothing.
Soon Rudy had to see for himself how right Silgur was. Within Laldiroff, they passed a large number of dead spots, but the Gargonts refuge turned out to be the worst of that.
An empty plain was opened in front of the wanderers. That place was blown by harsh winds from the all sides. The ground underneath the feet was covered with bizarre patterns of the froze. Rudy expected to see at least the ruins of the Gargonts settlement, but there was a dead void. The Gargonts created nothing for themselves.
There were seventeen of them, besides their poor brother, who Vuggo brought in. Most of them lay still on frozen ground, without any protection from the cold and the wind. Four of them were enduring the weakness, and slowly go away, each one in his own direction. The two unhappy Gargonts sat near each other, and bowing their heads. They quietly cried. Those, who have gone far away, were crying like children. Rudy believed that they tried to go as far away as possible so that the others would not hear their despair. In fact, the Gargonts have gone far away and wept like children because they couldn’t do anything else.
Chapter 16. The chosen against the insane – the insane against the outcast
They were the only children of the Great Spirit to have been able to overcome the hard way, travelling through the changeable expanses of Laldiroff. The people from the settlements of the Gungs, the Margalons, the Visgs and the Sirlebings, who before the meeting with the envoys of Aliel had no name and did not know of the existence of each other, they met the first wanderers openly and cordially.
Nothing in Aliel’s favorite children caused concern about what's going on. There was no sign of danger. Nothing was going to be lost by them. Not noticing what was happening around them, they went to their destination, with absolute certainty that the people they met existed in a specific but perfectly normal way, and that life within Laldiroff was going as it should be.
They were fortunate enough to reach the final point of the chosen path, after which the wanderers could open a short way to their home. “Black Rock” – the name of this iconic place. In the farthest depths, under the Black Rock, Kölkulla was waiting for them. The Keeper of the Truth of the Great Spirit, Kölkulla stood guard the sacred values of Aliel. She was the only one who could give his children access to their home, or forever deny them the hope that it would ever happen.
They walked the easy path which should have been difficult. The triumph of their victory was not real. The mission that Aliel entrusted them with, they didn’t accomplish. Meeting Kölkulla was impossible for them, but the children of the Great Spirit got their way by resorting to simple human trickery. The first wanderers consciously chose the easy way, unaware that in doing so they had betrayed the trust of the Father.
At the beginning of their journey, when they met the wild Gungs, they realized that speed and indifference to everything gave them an advantage. So, quickly and indifferently, they moved from one settlement to another, and ignored what they had to notice and fix. Their main duty was to pass on the people extraordinary treasures – the gift of the Great Spirit. His children, as the bearers of this gift, could discover and opened in people what no one knew. It was in their power to awaken the heat of love in the frozen hearts, impart special knowledge to the faint and limited minds, and showed people that a man who couldn’t do anything yesterday can do great miracles tomorrow.
Kölkulla knew all of their mistakes, unlike wanderers themselves. The status of divine chosen children was blinded their eyes and dulled their minds. The children of Aliel perceived that as divine greatness. The harsh verdict of Kölkulla they accepted with anger and reproach. Their disobedience was audacious – they intended to destroy the Black Rock and kill Kölkulla, but The Keeper of the Truth of the Great Spirit did not forget who she and her words were powerfully than even the most violent threats.
Kölkulla ordered them to go back. Wishing to gain at least a small advantage for themselves, the first children of Aliel, once again resorting to simple human trickery, planned to return to the place where their journey had begun on the way they’ve already travelled. They believed that it would free them from the long and exhausting ordeals, and also allow them to look closely at the Sirlebings, the Visgs, the Margalons and the Gungs, in order to solve their Father’s mystery.
For centuries, they have wandered through the emptiness of Laldiroff, going through violent upheavals, succumbing to deep, pervasive despair and asserting themselves in disbelief. They couldn’t find any settlements. Over time the Aliel’s children began to feel simple human hatred of each other.
For centuries after living in despair, they tortured each other. It began that day where they split into warring groups. But, despite intransigent divisions, all of them were moved inextricably in the same direction. If they had no immortality, they would have wiped each other out in minutes, but the Great Spirit couldn’t let them live as they wish.
One day, not believing their own happiness, they made it to the coast. That meant that somewhere in the vicinity, there might be the Gungs. Last time the Gungs seemed them nice for them to be incredibly kind and always cheerful. The children of Aliel were acknowledge their first victory with inspired, but in advance. They thought nothing was easier for them than to deal with ordinary people.
Finding the coastal settlers proved difficult. The road to the Gungs was a dangerous stretch with steep cliffs separating the shore from the Great Water. For the first time, the children of Allel refused to take the obvious risks. Later, in despair they began to move cautiously towards their intended destination. They were driven by simple human anger and the desire to defeat that what’s causing they suffered a humiliating defeat.
For the second time, the Gungs met them with curiosity, but no longer let the uninvited guests near themselves, their homes, and chased them away from the place of their main actions. As before, they fervently worshiped the Great Water in order to receive great gifts in return. Every time, content with the gifts that they found, the Gungs fell into a pure ecstasy. A special condition could have possessed the Gungs for days. During this time, they merged furiously with each other bodies in the true belief that they shared a common spirit. Watching this, Aliel’s children were confused and trying to find answers to difficult questions. They did not understand what their mission was, and that Aliel wanted to give over to the Gungs, who apparently worshipped their deity.
Furiously calling of the Father, they were left without his answer. So one of them, who was always the first and who decided what they did and what they didn’t do, he decided to listen to his mind. The message of his mind was accepted unconditionally by the others.
The children of the Great Spirit confirmed their decision when they went down to Cozy Bay and saw the Gungs orgy unfolding there. They thought that they should, at all costs, forbid the Gungs from worshipping the deity they accepted. They believed it was their duty to Aliel.
After listening to the anger speech of wanderers, the Gungs calmed down and went to their homes. Over the next few days, the first Aliel’s children celebrated the power of their beliefs with pride. Their words were heeded at first, without resisting or reproaching. Life in the settlement was peaceful, and the Gungs seemed quiet and calm. They conscientiously fulfilled their primary duty – fishing and singing joyful songs. Thus, having established that their mission with the Gungs had been completed, the first wanderers went out looking for a way to the Margalons.
That journey turned out to be the most difficult one in their history. In their attempts to follow the path, they encountered violent blizzards and lost their bearings under the merciless onslaught of the elements. The first children of the Great Spirit were thrown to unknown lands, and their journey stretching for many years. The blizzards followed them wherever they went. The harsh conditions prevented them from regaining consciousness and regaining their lost strength. This torment continued until they accidentally came to the coast which they knew. Exhausted by the unknown, they joyously overcame a dangerous stretch. It was a way to the Gungs.
What they saw in a coastal settlement gave them their first sense of doubt about their initial success. The Gungs were still self-absorbed into ecstasy, only this time they were possessed of wild passionately. Since then, they have lost their good looks and joyful temper. They have also lost the sense of their duty.
Shocked by the brazen disobedience of the Gungs, the first children of the Great Spirit angrily declared the previous prohibition for the second time. They felt a simple human hatred to zealots of the Great Water, and reinforced their order with threats. Upon hearing them, the Gungs vowed that they would not worship their deity. When they heard the answer that they wanted, the first children of the Great Spirit could not help believing the Gungs. Satisfied with this, they went out looking for a way to the Margalons again.
But, once again, an unknown force for many years confused the ways of the first wanderers, misleading the unfortunate. They continued to traipsing until they reached the coast again. As they reached the Gungs settlement, they saw that the Gungs didn’t keep their vows. Their orgies unfolded even more furiously, taking from the Gungs most of their lives. Once a good settlement, after many years, it was looked abandoned, and the great breadwinners seemed to forget who they were and why they live for.
For the third time, the first children of Aliel declared the Gungs the initial prohibition, threatening in the name of the Great Father. Upon hearing this, the Gungs brutally beat them and drove the envoys of the Great Spirit from their settlement.
Realizing that they would have to suffer again and again in painful journeys and repeatedly meet the Gungs, the children of the Great Spirit succumbed to the crushing sense of rejection of their own living conditions. Unable to control the simplest human feelings, they stopped and began to curse the Father. When all the curses were said, they declared without regret their renunciation of the Great Spirit. Then Aliel replied to them:
- You are free.
The Father accepted their choice. As a farewell, Aliel asked them:
- What can I call you?
- The Gargonts, – answered the one who was always the first and who decided what they did and what they didn’t do.
- From now on, my contempt will be called, – said Aliel.
The Great Spirit left them without his protection in the place where they demanded their release. After recovering from a delusion of inadvertent happiness, the Gargonts realized that they found themselves in a place unsuitable for a dignified existence, in which life was not envisaged originally and even the Ludivs did not go there.
The Gargonts embraced freedom with only what was theirs – that is, nothing. Their courage and determination was only enough for a while. Unable to cope with the lives of ordinary people, they were forced to return to the Gungs for help and shelter. For their part, they made a solemn promise that they would be as fierce and passionate worshippers of the Gungs’ deity. The Gungs refused to admit them to their settlement, but did not leave the helpless Gargonts without support. They generously shared the gifts of the Great Water, and for the first time their support was free of charge.
Many centuries have passed, during which successive generations of Gargonts became degenerate. Cruel parents were replaced by more violent children. The immortal Gargonts turned to the great breadwinners, asking for at least some of the gifts of the Great Water. Being harassed and humiliated by the Gungs, they were received a little of what they asked for. All happening within Laldiroff had developed for better or worse, but the Gargonts never learned to help themselves in any way.
Chapter 17. Liberation
The impossibility was at the heart of the Gargonts' curse. Their hearts were beating calmly, continuing their torment. There was something terrible, but mystically attractive tantalizing in their eyes. The transparent eyes, drowning in the darkness of the eye sockets, instantly absorbed the carelessly abandoned, curious look. Rudy happened to be under the enchanting influence of the mysterious eyes of one of the Gargonts. As he gazed into the dark abyss, he was caught up something by incomprehensible to his mind, but accepted by his soul. It was hoping to find something there. Everything he could find there actually belonged to him, because the Gargonts had nothing but nothingness.
Too much time has passed the previous meeting with the Gargonts to the present moment. The Gargonts could no longer accept the gifts that Vuggo had so diligently procured. Prolonged starvation drove their bodies to irreversible changes. They rejected the food, and sometimes the drink, thus torturing themselves even more. Rudy was convinced that these poor souls could no longer be saved.
- We will give our death to the Gargonts, – said Gallagud to his brothers.
His decision meant that all the poison extracted from the Suloon of the slain Varlung will be given to their rejected brothers, and wanderers depriving themselves of perhaps the only chance to escape the burdens of wandering forever.
Vuggo was genuinely sorry for the Gargonts, but could not agree with Gallagud. Without revealing his true thoughts, Ulligrassor was also not agree with that decision, but unlike Vuggo took the position of the silent observer. Silgur and Muniard knew that Gallagud and Vuggo were equally right. Migurnock was ready to accept any outcome of the alarming situation. Wurn was prepared to accept only the position of Gallagud. Raron, like Ulligrassor, was a silent observer, but did not agree with any of the brothers, which neither of them ever knew.
The first children of Aliel, who by their own volition became the Gargonts, in the old days, when their strength and power were maintained by the will of the Father, if they being in such a situation, they would never give away the poison they had obtained. Aliel’s current children, however valuable their chance to die and to be freed from their burdens, they were able to make a difficult decision and given poison to those they saw as most in need of rescue.
The moment of the Gargonts' death was unintentionally reminiscent of a mystical ritual. Migurnock painstakingly created what was required of him. He gave to Gallagud a prepared poison in the chalice, which was the most beautiful and valuable of all that belonged to him. All the wanderers pulled out their drums, obviously wishing to say goodbye to the brothers in a special way. The Gargonts lay peacefully in a row and waited quietly, not knowing what.
The wanderers could not start the final action, but time was merciless – each moment steadily reinforced their doubts. The good thoughts confused them, but they managed to keep their true spirit. The truth was on their side. Despite of their own fears, they started.
Wurn, Ulligrassor, Migurnock, Silgur and Muniard beat the drums to a rare, calm rhythm. Vuggo gently raised the first Gargont, and Gallagud brought to Gargont’s lips the chalice with poisoned drink. Remembering his eternal thirst, Gargont relished a first sip. His dreadful dried-up face began to change. The Gargont’s had a serene smile, and it looked scary to Rudy. Then, Gallagud and Vuggo left their brother alone. The first Gargont felt a sense of unthinkable happiness. But as the wanderers moved on to the next Gargont, something happened with the Gargont, who was already drunk the poison. No one could have predicted that.
The wanderers knew that the only thing that could kill the Aliel’s children was the poison extracted from Suloon. However, until that fateful day, no one had dared to do such of action. No one knew that death by the Suloon was excruciating and took a long time to come. The children of Aliel were created immortal, and the Great Spirit provided special punishment for those who did not appreciate the greatest of his gifts. Those who chose death over eternal life had to accept almost all of the manifestations of doom.
The poor Gargont was screaming in pain – his body was cramping. He was curled up by a repeated vomiting. He was choking. His body is swollen and his skin is covered with yellow-green spots. There was an acrimonious stench around him.
Vuggo tried to help the suffering brother, but all his actions only made things worse. The Gargont began to lose his skin in the areas of touch. The flaps of his skin were falling off in large chunks, and opening the internal rot. The Gargont rotted alive. From the first moment, when he during the epiphany of happiness, he went blind, but it was after that that that his eyes stopped looking empty. The consciousness was regained to Gargont. The consciousness had always remained with him, but it was hidden deep inside him and forgotten soon, because of his unbelievable pride and foolish disdain.
Muniard was the only one who found a solution that he believed could remedy the terrible situation. Taking the urn from Ulligrassor, he approached Gargont, removed Aurora’s ashes from the urn and gave a small handful into the open palms of the Gargont. Before the culmination of sacral action, he said:
- It’ll put you out of your misery. Accept this as a sign of our Father’s love. Aliel has forgiven you, brother.
Muniard’s lies make a miracle. Inexplicable. Cynical. Absurd. Rudy couldn’t believe of what was happening – is the truth. He tried to reject all of what unfolded before his eyes, but each subsequent event proved to him that only his opinion was rejected. The Gargont calmed down. His suffering began to subside quietly. It seemed that death was about to follow. But the wait had lingered. Overcoming his weakness, the Gargont asked to wanderers:
- Please, tell me what he’s like now. I wish to see him so much. He forgave me, but I didn’t even remember he was, and I can’t believe he exists.
Having said about the Father, he cried like a child, who was devoid of parental love. The wanderers tried to help him remember what their Father was like, who gave so many virtues and troubles for his children. They believed that the Gargonts had the right to feel part of the Great for the last time.
With each of Aliel’s children had his own way of thinking about Father:
- He is merciful, – said Muniard.
- He is always forgiving, – said Ulligrassor.
- He is wise, – said Gallagud.
- He is the Great, – said Wurn.
- He is omnipotent, – said Vuggo.
- He is all-knowing, – said Silgur.
- He is a loving Father, – said Migurnock.
- He is a just, – said Raron, but the Gargont didn’t hear him.
The Death came to him and freed the first of Aliel’s child from all the suffering he deserved and deserved.
The other Gargonts survived what their brother did. They suffered unbearable pain, monstrous seizures, and rotted alive. As soon as they had a handful of ashes in their hands, as a symbol of love and forgiveness of the Father, they felt instantaneous relief, and then they were accepted by Death itself.
Rudy was outraged. When he approached Silgur, he expressed his indignation:
- What happened here seems to me to be beyond the worst of cruelty! Why did they let the Gargonts suffer if the fake ritual worked?! Muniard could have given them that wretched ash in the initially to calm them down!
- It’s just ashes that have no power if you trust the void, – replied Silgur in his manner, – but the same useless ash lead to a miracle if you trust consciousness. Unfortunately, consciousness has returned to the Gargonts only through suffering.
The wanderers could not stay and bury the bodies of their dead brothers, as their conscience demanded. The corpses of the Gargonts rapidly rotted, and the ground beneath them has changed horribly – the unspeakable abomination was seeping from it. But the worst was the monstrous stench. The all of wanderers were wondering, why death by Suloon’s venom is so horrible and humiliating. For the children of Aliel, the experience with the Gargonts was a lesson that each of them learned as best he could, and for Rudy, it has been just an unexplained horror he wished to forget.
Chapter 18. Contempt
They managed to find the right direction. The way to the Margalons was opened for them for the first time. Hesitantly moving forward, the wanderers attempted to explore the frontiers unknown to them in order to anticipate possible difficulties.
Rudy kept his eyes open and tried not to lose sight of the important points. Observing the mood and reactions of the wanderers, he found them a complete lack of preparedness for the new conditions. Knowledge and experience have not helped them to trust themselves in situations that require patience, humility and endurance. This seemed impossible, but Rudy was convinced of the truth of his assumptions day by day.
Like ordinary people, the wanderers were exposed to the simplest of fears. They demonstrated their powerlessness and inability to take a punch when an anxiety was their adversary. Merging with the general fortune, Rudy began to doubt the loyalty of his original choice. He was almost certain that at the time of their encounter, when the drifting ice with him was off the shores of Laldiroff, the wanderers who accidentally find him took advantage of his helplessness and misled him to lead him to the achievement of their an obscure and dubious purpose. At the time, a terrified and powerless man, Rudy embarked on a dangerous and pointless journey with crazy savages who thought they were children of unknown for Rudy, but a true God for them, who was having the strangest name Aliel. Tormented by heavy reflections, Rudy, like the wanderers, was unable to bear the blow of the new conditions and surrendered to a sense of appalling anxiety. For himself, he was doomed.
The new way has proved to be as long and endless as any before. From the horizon to the horizon, wherever they look, the space remained unchanged. For months, they heard the silence, saw the darkness and found nothing but emptiness. They couldn’t bear to be near each other. They all suffered from the same thing, but each of them believed that the poisonous feeling poisoned only him. One, looking at the other, was suffering from tension he couldn’t control. The brother’s face was the object of an irritating, subdued rage followed by hatred, first towards the brother, who could not be looked at, and then towards himself for giving in to the unexplained dismay.
They remained faithful to their community, but their lives on the way to the Margalons remained separate – each doing what mattered most to him and no one dared to violate the other’s personal boundaries. As soon as there was an opportunity, Migurnock went into oblivion. His time of presence in reality was markedly shortened, and he no longer spared his life just to be in oblivion. With Migurnock, but not in his company, there was Ulligrassor. It was evident that he had been tormented by heavy reflections that he had not told him for the first time. The loudest and most joyful wanderer, for no apparent reason, has turned into a sad mute. Rudy thought that Ulligrassor was suffering from a lack of proper nutrition – as soon as Ulligrassor noticed Rudy’s unwitting gaze, he was attacked of debilitating scabies, which he described in one of their first conversations. Rudy shared with him the rest of his savings of meal, and Raron saw it. Rudy’s good deeds Raron thought as foolish, but he never stopped the foolish from making another noble gesture. Silgur and Muniard had become estranged from others, but from the beginning they drifted apart. Rudy hasn’t seen any of them for several days. Only in the union of Gallagud and Wurn all remained the same. Wurn appreciated Gallagud for everything, and Gallagud appreciated Wurn for continuing to appreciate him no matter what.
The only one who hasn’t changed under the new circumstances was Vuggo. He tried his best to spare the brothers hardship and inconvenience. All but Rudy and Raron took his help for granted, often answering to him that his involvement was unnecessary. Wurn was angry at his brother, because Vuggo having spent long days on the hunt in distant areas, from where he would come back every time with no prey. At that time he was leaving them. The brothers were unable to use his power and skill. But however far Vuggo went, in those places were no living things, except the wanderers and Rudy.
The walk mile by mile a hundred times, Vuggo was weary of wandering in search of a happy possibility, walking on a dead earth, the calm of which kept by the dead void, which sheltering that place by a dead silence. The Father did not hear him at the place of Death. When the hope of finding something was finally lost, Vuggo forced himself to walk the last mile. At the end of the way, he found the Muniard dead body. It seemed like a monstrous hallucination. In Vuggo’s adamant belief, this could only happen to him. Muniard’s fortitude was never in doubt. As the keeper of the secret knowledge of life, Muniard was also considered the keeper of life itself. The one who always found a compromise, Muniard did not find the compromise, which he needed. In the most obnoxious way, he dispelled the myth about his divine power. His body was rapidly rotted. Like the Gargonts, Muniard’s death brought unbearable suffer for him.
He willingly went to his death, admitting his own powerlessness. The new knowledge were uncontrolled and aggressively infecting his mind. Muniard could no longer live with his gift. Though unwittingly, but his involvement in the Gargonts' call to death brought him to the shock, when the wealth of words and expressions seemed to him to be a foolish paucity. Muniard silenced and never spoke again after he said the last word when the last Gargont died. None of the wanderers could remember the incident when Muniard told a lie. He wanted his last words to be untrue, because the truth available to him was ruthless and not good.
The horrific spectacle and the bitterness of the sudden loss knocked Vuggo off his feet. He couldn’t change anything. His sensitive soul mourned Muniard’s death. His mind mourned the failure to correct it and the lost chances when, because, in his opinion, Muniard could have been saved. Vuggo did not understand the truth of what was happening – by mourning his brother, in fact, he mourned himself.
Near the remains, there was an empty drinking bag on the destroyed dome. But the Muniard’s dead arm was holding one of Migurnock’s favorite chalices. A few drops of Suloon venom remained in the chalice. Vuggo remembered the day the Gargonts died, when he approached Migurnock in peace, without which he could not count on what he had long dreamed of. Migurnock accepted that gesture with an open heart, but Vuggo did not receive from him what he so desperately desired. He asked for a little poison for himself so that he could end his life, if his immortality becomes intolerable for him. Migurnock promised to give him the poison after the last Gargont drinks his share, but when the Gargonts’ story was over, there was no poison left for Vuggo.
Vuggo accepted a few drops of Suloon in chalice as a sign from above. For him, his life was unbearable in every moment, event and his personal act. The dark past mixed with the uncertain future, poisoning the present. Unable to forget the past to think only of the future, he wanted to stop the present.
He was not aware that the last drops of poison were not enough to summon death, but even one of them could destroy his life. Drink the Suloon meant abdicating the will of the Father. Aliel was ruthless towards those who went against his will, and even the most beloved of his children were brutally punished by him for expressing willfulness.
He was saved from a fatal mistake by a fierce beast that he could not have killed. A giant wolf suddenly appeared from the void and attacked Vuggo when he held the chalice to his lips. The last drops of Suloon were lost.
Ignorance was distorting the picture of reality. Vuggo wanted and was ready to fight for the truth and justice that wasn’t there. He had a grudge to the real truth and absolute confidence in the truth of his own illusions. His rage was enough to kill the beast, but the wolf disappeared as suddenly as it appeared.
After another defeat, which he regarded as his personal humiliation, Vuggo vowed to revenge to Migurnock and ever since waited for the right time when he could have the opportunity to lead his brother to the trap of the White Wasteland.
Chapter 19. Recognition
- What would you do if you had information that many peoples’ lives depended on? – Aurora asked to Rudy, shortly before she died.
- Luckily, I’m smart enough not to fill my head superfluous thoughts, – said Rudy, – that’s why your question is irrelevant to me and is unlikely to be.
- You think a lot of things depend on you because you’re such a smart guy.
- I don’t like the tone of your speech, Aurora! What do you mean?!
Aurora didn’t respond immediately. Something was clearly bothering her.
- I mean, isn’t up to us anything. Even, if we are the smartest. Our knowledge doesn’t power enough to make a timely impact on the fateful moment and fix everything. We’re just the holders of information that we can’t rule. We can’t fully absorb it. We can’t get it on the right way. The right way... who determines what it is?
For Rudy, that conversation almost immediately became unacceptable. He always had a fierce reaction – Rudy tried to stop what he thought was a woman’s stupidity. By then, communication with Aurora was more difficult than before. She spoke strangely and incomprehensibly, confusing and intertwining meanings, burdening simple notions with complex solutions, and yet she failed to say much. Rudy enjoyed short conversations on the substance, but with Aurora such communication was no longer possible. In the end, Rudy wondered if he loved her. It seemed to him that his love for her was long gone, but her death revealed the true answer to an exciting question.
Unfortunately, he loved Aurora, and that feeling was stronger than his selfish desire to suppress what he never managed to control. By holding himself back, Rudy turned joy into suffering, passion into anguish, and living feelings he was skilfully covered the pale mask of obscure emotions. The victory of many years turned into an eternal defeat. He did not look to the future with Aurora, because his eyes were always turned to the past where she was not. Having lost her, he continued to live in a past in which her image found its place.
From the moment she died, every night, fighting insomnia, he remembered their best times. Rudy was loving and caring. Next to him, under his strong protection, she felt confident. Alone with each other, they were revealing their true emotions. Their conversations were endlessly long, arousing in them the desire to explore each other to the end. Intimacy with Aurora was nothing like what happening between him and other women. He could boast to the world that he had a gift from the God.
The most memorable and wonderful time of his life was knocking on his door more than once. He didn’t let happen everything he dreamed of happen. Rudy mistook vivid fantasies based on unrealized desires for his genuine memories. Only Aurora’s love and loyalty were real. Wandering within Laldiroff gradually clarified his memory. To his horror, he became acquainted with that Rudy she knew.
Muniard’s death, like a sudden clue, opened up a locked part of Rudy’s mind. This event, incomprehensible to him, echoed that strange dialogue between him and Aurora. Her words haunted him day and night, on the way and during rest hours, when he was with everyone and when he was alone with himself. It seemed to him that what had happened long ago, and more recently, was the one and the main mystery of everything, but Rudy lacked the moral strength and knowledge to solve that. The answer was in the last sentence that Aurora hastily said behind.
- If you dare to reveal information that other peoples’ lives depend on, you’ll probably be killed. If you’re afraid to do it, you become an unwitting accomplice to a wrongful cover-up, and then you can’t live, because your conscience will haunt you. You can hardly last a year with that kind of burden.
In these words, a truly clue was given, but Rudy failed to comprehend it, for he did not try to comprehend what was originally given to him.
Chapter 20. The Margalons and the Visgs. A false peace against honest enmity
The smiles of innocent babies. The eyes of wise old men. The singing voices of young men and women. Faces covered with unique patterns of deep wrinkles, which are striking evidence of their mysterious nature. Gentle strides. Meek movements. Divine goodness of expressions on their faces – the Margalons called themselves faithful and true disciples of God.
The Margalons, like their closest neighbors Visgs, were immortal for centuries. They were prolonging their existence by them escaping into special condition that their choice. The Margalons delayed their demise by waiting for a divine message addressed only to them as the only faithful missionaries of the truth of the highest good. The Visgs delayed their demise due to a boiling hatred of the Margalons and a thirst for blood revenge for the grievance, that the Margalons, in fact, they weren’t making.
The peaceful expectation of divine reward, as well as the adamant fortress of the Margalons faith, would not have been possible without the ritual dance of Yellorunglaurrt, in which they lulled their thoughts and dulled their senses. Dancing this sacred dance they kept the balance at the border, between the living and the non-living conditions. Their passing from life lengthened life itself and this was the mystery of their loaned immortality. The circles of Yellorunglaurrt turned into a mystical action with truly miraculous power. The rapid whirlwinds that have arisen since of a cycle of dozens of circular twists in one direction, and the cycle of twists in the opposite direction, were fascinating the Margalons long hours and, in times of grim anguish, they lived many days in total oblivion. They were made three spins with worship, expressing their devotion to God. Then they were furiously raising their open hands into the sky. At the end of their ritual they always asked God what they deserved. Their God gave them nothing visible, did not ease the conditions of their existence, did not open new ways for them, and did not take away their hard burdens. Aliel was not their God and the Great Spirit could not fight the one who did not exist, nor could it help those who no sought help from him. The symbol of their unshakeable loyalty to their God was a deep scar on their chests, meaning that every Margalon was ready to stab himself in the heart without sparing his life for God’s sake. The symbol of the presence of their God was the special condition in which the Margalons were being. In that condition was revealed in them their subtle sense of intimacy and connection to the sacred stream. Declaring themselves to be divine, they rejected everything that was natural and the Margalons no longer needed food, life-giving drinking and the rest.
With caution and from afar, the Yellorunglaurrt sacral dances were watched by Visgs. The endless life of the Margalons, who were devoid of hardship and care, was perceived by the Visgs as a flagrant injustice. Fully devoting their attention to the pointless exploration of existence of the enemy settlement, the Visgs forgot themselves. Distressed by the unjustified and, in their view, the unfair immortality of the Margalons, the Visgs failed to notice that they too had lived much longer time it was defined for their life.
The Visgs didn’t dance the ritual dances. They didn’t need to believe in God and expect miracles from nowhere. Without renouncing their natural existence, they were living in a simple and self-reliant life, and they did not depart from the long-established rules of their community. Knowing the power of the Great Spirit, none of them wasn’t turned to Aliel, asking for help and patronage. The truth of their lives was full independence and the sanctity of personal understanding of what is happening.
At the right time, the Visgs had left their settlement, going to the far territories of Laldiroff to find well-deserved rest and food. Their journeys were long. The new territories they had discovered tempted the Visgs of abundance of opportunities, the wealth of the animal world and the rare gifts of nature. But no matter how far they went, no matter how tempting the free world may be the Visgs always came home to the place of the void, and hopeless darkness they had to share with the Margalons. They were coming back to carry out their own mission. Tirelessly watching the enemy, the Visgs waited patiently for the moment when the enemy weakened, giving them the opportunity to destroy it. However, the enemy maintained its position, circling in their carefree dance of Yellorunglaurrt.
The established rhythm of life of the Margalons and the Visgs was broken only twice, and both times their space was invaded by the children of Aliel. The first envoys of the Great Spirit found themselves in the Visgs and the Margalons settlements at a time when, the irreconcilable enemies in the future, they lived in peace, because they were not subject to the overwhelming expectations of the self-appointed agents of divine influence. The peaceful Margalons introduced the first wanderers to the obnoxious Visgs and helped the uninvited guests to gain the trust to themselves, without which communication between the Visgs and the strangers could not take place. Only to Visgs’ help the wanderers could have found the last settlement of the Sirlebings. Not only did the Visgs know all the ways in Laldiroff’s expanses, but only the Visgs felt the movement of ways. They led the first children of Aliel by the shortest and safest route to the Sirlebings, after which they parted forever without vowing to keep memories about each other.
Time has distorted the old attitudes. The Margalons greeted the wanderers with worship and reverence. They mistook the wanderers and Rudy for the Messengers of God carrying sacred news. Then, unlike the original inhabitants of Laldiroff, the Rudy’s personality was played a fatal role. The little man, with the extraordinarily dark color of his skin and the eyes in which was the mystery of a completely different life form had taken root, was greeted with particular awe. If he was looking at them, they looked at him with a fawning look back. If he was looking in some direction, the Margalons looked in that direction too. As soon as he has pronounced the slightest sound, the Margalons were screaming with excitement. Wherever he went, they followed him, constantly bowing to him. It seemed that he led them where he wanted. In fact, the Margalons were leading him wherever they wanted him to go. Time and again, they offered him to join of their special ritual dance for him. Rudy was pleasantly flattered by this attention, and he was ready to accept their interesting offer, but each time it was Silgur’s responded instead of Rudy. Silgur firmly refused wishes of the Margalons, without explanation. In return, he offered them what they’ve been waiting for. He said to them:
- The day has come when each of us will find what we were born to do on this sacred land! We’ve been waiting for this!
Those words were enough to overthrow Rudy’s elevated status in an instant. The Margalons forgot about the extraordinary little man when they saw someone who was more important to them. Silgur was furious and attracting.
- The God heard all of you every minute. In His memory saved the all words you have spoken. He was delighted by your glorious dancing. He kept all of you in the dark so that you could cultivate the strength to endure a special ordeal bequeathed only to the chosen. You were always right. Your actions were right. Your thoughts were not clouded by ignorance.
The Margalons rejoiced. The Messenger of God confirmed what they tirelessly proved for centuries. Inspired by an unknown source, Silgur continued to incite a mass state of sacral ecstasy in the Margalons’ by delivering to them specific messages. His figure was so powerful and attracting that even his brothers and Rudy, for whom communication with Silgur had long been difficult, could not take their eyes off him, and, like the Margalons, they were feeling the fanatical attraction to him.
- Your lives are full of meaning, – Silgur continued his speech, – you didn’t allow ignorant strangers who weren’t the God’s chosen desecrating the truth! You have held up the defence of the sacred values with dignity. You are the beloved children of God! You deserve a great blessing!
When Silgur approached the Margalons, he pointed to a woman who was hidden behind her men backs. Happiness came to light on her righteous face. Those who, with their backs covered her from the proximity of the God’s Messenger began to push the chosen woman forward – into the arms to the speaker of their God. Silgur bow to her and represented the chosen woman in a new status to the Margalons’.
- She is chosen by God! From this day forward, listening to her, you will receive his messages!
To prove his message, Silgur took the urn, which was indispensable to any of the cults they invented, and dumping the remains of Aurora’s ashes over the head of a woman crying with happiness. The Margalons got their way.
Having forgotten about the Messenger of their God, the Margalons surrounded the chosen woman, and, without asking her permission, they have started to dance the ritual dance that they had been wanting to dedicate Rudy before. Meanwhile, Silgur gathered all his brothers and strongly ordered:
- Be prepared to act! Now we must stand together!
Rudy did not understand the reasons for the fears of the wanderers. The Margalons danced with passion around the chosen woman. Their solemn cries stunned and confused him. Rudy was dizzy at all when he looks at the splendid movements and the rapid turns of the Margalons’ unnatural flexible bodies. With each circle, their bows became more furious, and the smiles of grace turned into hysterical laughter.
Reaching the peak of spiritual ecstasy, the Margalons attacked their chosen woman and knocked her down. Like a pack of willing dogs, they tormented a woman and gave her no chance at salvation. Aroused by a crazy euphoria, they kissed her body and shout ferociously at each other in the fight for her sacred attention. The noise and frenzied confusion were stopped when one of the Margalons rose above the others, holding a bloody hand the head of the woman who was the speaker of the God.
Rudy went crazy. Margalon’s bloody hand held Aurora’s head. The disfigured face was shown right in front of him like a horror symbol, so that he could see, and remember – his happy chance, with his permission, was destroyed by those he did not think of or know about.
For the Margalons the dead head turned into a monstrous symbol of their worship. The Margalons crawled behind whoever was carrying the new idol. Their heads ploughed the blood-covered snow. Their snow-white garments were tainted by the mud that the Margalons took it upon themselves. The people who were strictly held on eternal purity now looked vile, like carrion.
Taking the monstrous opportunity, Silgur ran to the scene of the murder of the chosen of God and lifted from the ground the disfigured body of the poor woman, which was trampled zealots’ feet.
- Follow me! – he shouted to his brothers.
The wanderers did not dare to disobey him. Without hindsight, having forgotten at the Margalons their domes, they moved in a nervous hurry to the Visgs’ settlement. Silgur ran in the front, like a leader. He carried a corpse on his shoulders. Rudy ran after the others and feared what would happen to them next.
The Visgs met them with hostility. United in a tightly knit group, they were holding in their hands the daggers they had found off the East Coast. They were ready to fight. Rudy’s mind couldn’t accept that he saw. The Visgs looked exactly like the Margalons. They had the same physical traits, the same clothing and the same manner of speech. The cumbersome daggers were looked bizarre and irrelevant to the lives of the inhabitants of the Laldiroff expanse. Those were suited as decoration for the eastern noblemen rather than as a tool for survival in the harsh lands. “This cannot be”, – said to himself Rudy. But it was.
Silgur was the first to dare to move closer the Visgs. When he approached them, he carelessly threw at their feet the body of the murdered Margalons’ woman.
- It’s a true sign of Margalons weakness, – Silgur has confidently stated.
The Visgs were inspired by the unexpected turn of events. One of them approached the body and began to rip the dead Margalons’ woman clothes. Finding the scar on her chest, which was a sign that the Margalon was indeed in front of him, the Visg began to rejoice, calling to himself the others. Confirmation of the vulnerability of their once-powerful enemies, hiding under the protection of unknown forces, ignited a fierce impatience in the Visgs, which the all-knowing Silgur did not envisage.
They got what they wanted for centuries, and now they couldn’t be stopped. With no time to waste, the Visgs went to kill the Margalons. As often happened to him, Rudy was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Scared to death, he stood in the way of the Visgs and was accidentally picked up by a distraught crowd. Unwittingly, Rudy moved back to the Margalons settlement, risking being caught in the middle of a bloody massacre. The wanderers tried to keep up with them, but at that moment, even the hurricane could envy the Visgs.
The Margalons were caught at the height of their euphoria. Someone from the Visgs attacked the newest Margalon leader, snatching the sacred head from his hands. Then, like from the sky, the head fell right into Rudy’s hands. And once again, he saw Aurora’s disfigured face. Suddenly, someone, invisible but present, whispered in his ear: “By killing the image – someone killed a human. If someone wants you dead, you will die. Even if your death is wanted by a fool who means nothing in his own life. Now you live, but next minute in your presence, perhaps your life will be no necessity”. Taking what he heard as a sign, Rudy froze in the thick of the bloody events and waited his turn to die.
Without explanation, without charge, without a declaration of war, the Visgs attacked the Margalons and slaughtered all of their declared enemies. While reveling in hatred, they assaulted anyone they could find. Rudy saw someone preparing to give him a fatal blow, but suddenly Vuggo was next to him. An evil giant, from whom Rudy could not expect anything good, Vuggo carried Rudy out on his hands beyond the escalating carnage. But his heroism was limited – when the danger from the Visgs was behind him, Vuggo aggressively threw Rudy on a bloodied snow, like the carcass of a deer he killed.
The death of the Margalons could not satisfy the centuries-old fury of the Visgs. When there was no one of the Margalons to kill, the Visgs committed a festive abuse of the dead bodies of the defeated enemies, thus, according to their belief, affirming their superiority and, above all, proving them right.
But their triumph was short-lived. When the Visgs gained that why would they had delayed their own lives, the life itself ceased to have meaning for them. One by one, not understanding what was happening to them, they fell down feeling powerless. Their deaths were peaceful.
In the confusion and horror of an apparently missed opportunity, Silgur ran up to the last live Visg.
- Which way do we find the Sirlebings? –he asked.
- Go wherever you want and there you’ll find what you need.
There was nowhere to go. Each of the wanderers wanted to follow his own direction and generally their intentions did not coincide. Their protective domes were destroyed in the brutal slaughter. The penultimate ordeal left them unprotected and without a meal, but that’s not the worst. Before the final ordeal, the wanderers realized they had lost their power.
Chapter 21. The path to ruin
Vuggo couldn’t stop thinking about great in its simplicity hint: “Go wherever you want and there you’ll find what you need”. His wish had nothing to do with their primary purpose. He could no longer deceive himself and force his essence to obey what his mind did not understand. The brutal pressure of the Great Spirit, whom he had no right to resist, was stronger than his patience. The search for the Sirlebings and the journey to the home they had dreamed of, Vuggo considered it a hopeless idea, which, instead of truth, was based on a primitive lie, always obvious and therefore seemingly impossible. For the first time, he stopped the thoughts that had been imposed on him and wondered why they considered a place they knew nothing about as their home. There was no answer. Even Silgur and Muniard had no idea what their home was. There was no evidence of its existence. All this time, the wanderers were inspired and controlled by something unknown that didn’t give them anything, but it was supposed to be wonderful.
Remembering the centuries-old ordeals that were tormenting them, the cruelty of which only the Gargonts could understand, he tried to find meaning in their endless searching, heroic struggle, self-sacrifice, duty to the Father, but in this entire he failed to reveal the value of life itself. He then remembered Aliel’s main testament, and it was a disappointing truth – all he could think of doesn’t make a sense. Time and again, in uttering these words, the wanderers were only dishonest towards themselves. In proclaiming one thing, they acted in the opposite direction, trying to expose the meaning of each phenomenon and, above all, a sense of their own destiny.
Believing that they were special, in fact, the wanderers were in the unenviable position of having no choice, unlike other, even the most miserable and despicable, inhabitants of the expanses of Laldiroff. They did not belong to themselves. Life was given to them not for them, but to fulfill the Father’s orders. Time and past events have produced harsh evidence that the importance of a great mission conceived and imposed by him has been forgotten by Aliel himself. Apparently, he’s forgotten about his wretched children.
Vuggo was close to the truth, but continued to think within the familiar limits of him and his brothers' delusions. He failed to grasp the truth which, would inevitably destroy his life support positions – the importance of a great mission is always based on meaning, and for the Great Spirit and his creations there is no meaning.
Watching the brothers from a new perspective, he saw not strong warriors, but a scattered group of useless weaklings. Everyone, except Raron, whose personal contribution to their common cause had always been equated to zero, they were remained in ignorance and sought to find the strength to move towards a goal, after achieving which they get nothing. It was a vague and highly questionable possibility that a goal could be achieved. The goal itself was also questionable.
In a new way, Vuggo looked at the once revered Silgur. He was impressed and resented by the position of his brother, who possessed the most precious gift. The wisest of them, chosen by the Father to store knowledge and reasonably dispose of it, Silgur was as assiduous as his uninformed brothers. He tried to realize the delusion that initially clouded their minds. The lies became more and more evident, and it’s having been able to break through seemingly impregnable blocks, which always imprisons any thought. Silgur did not possess the virtues they were accustomed to thinking of and relied upon.
For unknown reasons, Gallagud was considered the chief among them, but his word was no more powerful than the word of the same Ulligrassor, he did not make important decisions alone, in any difficult situation relying on the brothers. Wise decisions were suggested to him by Silgur and Muniard, the issues of their displacement and survival in the lands of Laldiroff, he trusted Vuggo and Slargart.
Wurn gave orders to the brothers on behalf of Gallagud, feeling and representing himself as the second-most important son of Aliel, but he was useless, foolish, rude and in fact unsuited to survival. Wurn had neither the authority nor the respect of his brothers, though he persistently denied it. Had he not formed a strong fraternal alliance with Gallagud, Wurn would inevitably have been lost in one of the snowstorms and would have been easily forgotten by the brothers on their first journey.
Ulligrassor forced his brothers to perceive him as the weakest, the most inexperienced and the most harmless of them, but as soon as they looked at him more closely, they discovered his strength, his agility and his cunning. Willingly taking on the most unfavorable role in their fraternity, Ulligrassor endured the hardships of their wandering with the least loss, hiding behind the backs of those who could not afford to lie and hide.
Raron was empty on the inside, but he never tried to seem better. With a lot of possibilities, he didn’t manipulate others, as each of them did. He wasn’t a burden, but he wasn’t doing any good. Vuggo never relied on Raron and had no grudge against him, for Raron gave nothing and he didn’t demanded nothing.
The most despicable and hated of all for Vuggo was Migurnock. Wherever they were, whatever happened to them, in the hours of grief and despair and ignorance and danger, even in the rare moments of joy by the triumph of random victories, he savored his cursed drink and went where he was best, betraying his brothers, Laldiroff and Father. Vuggo couldn’t take it anymore.
“I’ll go wherever I want and there I’ll find what I need”, – he decided.
Patiently waiting until the moment when Migurnock began to return from oblivion, without losing precious time and taking advantage of a unique opportunity, Vuggo caught his brother when he continued to be in a borderline state. Without giving Migurnock a chance to regain consciousness and think hard enough, Vuggo led his hated brother where he wanted to go.
After a short distance, they found themselves in a place where not everyone was able to find a way out. Around them opened tantalizing, bright spaces, previously unknown and arousing trepidation excitement. The pure light was smoothly dissipated, revealing to the weary eyes the delightful images that were alien to the desert monotony of Laldiroff’s expanses. Following his own desire, Vuggo led himself and Migurnock into the White Wasteland, and the treacherous place first met him not with a grim void, but on the contrary – White Wasteland opened to him the wonderfully beautiful dream world of Migurnock.
The peaceful silence aroused a sense of security in them. It was an illusion that Vuggo knew perfectly well, but this time, he succumbed to the game set for them by death itself. In the beginning, he succumbed to a lie, and then he easily believed it. It turned out to be possible. Knowledge can warn, but it can’t protect.
For the first time trapped in the White Wasteland, about which he knew little, Migurnock was wary, but to his surprise, did not foresee danger. He liked what he saw. The consciousness, which was confused after the endless escaping into oblivion, saw everything in the White Wasteland as unimaginably beautiful and special. He has seen these landscapes hundreds of times, almost every day, but something unknown erased from his mind the memory, filling the vacant space with hypnosis that was turning the value of personal experience into a hopeless folly.
They could be happy to find themselves in a place where the magical voices of thousands of songbirds lulled their troubled thoughts, and the sound of the distant springs soothed the desperate heartbeat that extended not life, but only pain. For the last time, they could imagine that they had found their home in the most picturesque part of the world, which was hidden behind innumerable mysteries. They were given the opportunity to be fooled with total dedication, without any limitations, but they stood still like two an ancient stones until darkness has appeared from the horizon. Everywhere they looked, darkness was everywhere, surrounding them and presaging disaster.
There were animals that they killed over the centuries. Vuggo tried to imagine how many sacrifices they had made, how much meat they had eaten, how many skins they had used, how many living beings were killed in vain, but he had no time to remember – the answer was before his eyes. There were too many animals. Their unborn descendants followed then, and offensive movement of darkness was seemed endless.
Vuggo looked with horror at his victims. The horror was that strong and beauty living beings were killed by him in haste, to satisfy an intermediate need. Much beauty was invisible to him, because he gives his life to fight his common sense. Much of value has been ruined by him, or at his request, for what must be ruined in the first place. Realizing the cost of his mistakes, Vuggo intended to accept the just punishment with dignity. In his mind, justice consisted in the brutal massacre of him and his brother.
Migurnock trusted his truth – it was his only living principle. Having seen what he could not understand or did not want to perceive, the cunning one, he hurried to pull out his salvation drink in order to seize the opportunity not to be at the epicenter of the situation, but above it. He wanted transformed into a dangerous and invincible beast – the killer, because of which perished the good half of the animals to whom unknown forces have returned life for vengeance. But no cunning one, and not even the beloved son of the Great Spirit, can compete in the skill of cunning with Death itself.
Taking a drink, Migurnock disappeared from the White Wasteland. His wish came true, but with an insidious ruse of Death. He was transformed into a deer, tormented by a giant black wolf. Death brought Migurnock back to the last moment when he was in disguise of a fierce beast and killed a deer. Death, whom Aliel tried to deprive of power, brutally forced his son to feel the pain and suffering he could inflict on living beings. Migurnock fell into a trap from which he could no longer escape. Death took him when the heart of the poor deer whom he once killed, stopped beating. In the final moments of his existence, Migurnock had to realize that life was not as simple and understandable as he had anticipated, but another of the sons of the Great Spirit died without understanding the truth.
Vuggo allowed a sense of remorse to defeat his own self-proclaimed power. He was waiting too long to die, calling Death as hard as his dying creature was calling Life to stay with him. By then, he gladly met the inevitable. Falling down on his knees before his own victims, the great hunter died without feeling pain. The animals circled the place of his death for a long time, and tromp Vuggo’s dead body far into the ground. They hid the one who exterminated them, so that was nothing indicated his existence within Laldiroff.

- They're not coming back, – Silgur assured his brothers, – and we have to move on. It’s better for Rudy to die of hunger and cold on the way than to die of the same here without taking a step.
Such an argument should have pleased Rudy, but his reaction was the exact opposite. Events unfolded too rapidly. The paradoxical and unnecessarily cruel story, by he felt, was coming to an end. Rudy’s met his upcoming premature demise with the acknowledgement of the worst of his life’s mistakes before his fatal journey in lends of Laldiroff – each time being absolutely confident in himself, in fact, he acted as the obedient executor of the wishes, expectations and decisions of another one he was dependent on. In fact, he was having no value to himself. He ended up on Laldiroff to fulfill Aurora’s desire. In these lands hostile to him, he could be saved from unbearable suffering by the wanderers, so he had to obey their will.
- Which direction do you think we should take? – Wurn asked that with the ridicule, because he did not want to listen to his brother.
Before answering, Silgur remembered the cherished words: “Go wherever you want and there you’ll find what you need”.
- We need to move northeast, – he said with confidence.
- Why? – asked Wurn.
- That’s what I want.
- And I don’t want to go your way! – Gallagud said that, barely containing his long-standing anger.
- I don’t even want to listen to you! – said Wurn.
- If I go in the direction you’re suggesting, but this is not that way I want to go, then I won’t find what I need. I want the same as all of you. It follows that because of me, we will wander forever and we can only find the Sirlebings if a miracle is happening. But I can no longer rely on. I’m ready to lead all of us where I want to go, and it’s the only way we’re gonna get where we want to be. You’re suggesting we go in the direction that we’re getting used to.
- How dare you argue with me so stubbornly?! – Gallagud angrily asked to Silgur, – At all times, we found the right ways, heading northwest. After all, Wurn and I wish to go northwest! Don’t you, Wurn?!
- It’s true! – the faithful and obedient Wurn replied, – I don’t want to go your way, Silgur! I don’t want to follow you! I don’t want to go with you!
Wurn’s bold remarks once again proved to Silgur that he was never wrong about his brother. Rudy, who had witnessed their conflict, was convinced that what Wurn had said had hurt Silgur badly, but he was wrong again. Silgur was relieved, as he himself did not want to go with Wurn, let alone follow him – the eternal slave of Gallagud, who forgetting that he was not a slave, but a brother and the same child of the Great Spirit Aliel.
- Each of us will go in the chosen direction. I will go to the northeast, and you go where yours wish calls. Let’s see who’s right.
In a petty dispute, they lost the most precious thing to the wanderers – it was their unshakable brotherhood. Only Wurn went with Gallagud. Rudy chose Silgur’s path, because Silgur was the only one for whom the Rudy’s existence’s was mattered. Raron also joined them, between the certainty of Silgur and the pride of Gallagud, choosing the first point. Ulligrassor didn’t want to go with anyone. He didn’t want to go anywhere at all. To join with Gallagud and Wurn was to enter into a lasting alliance between them. In this case, he would have an enemy in the person of Wurn without being able to enlist the support of the helpless leader Gallagud. Not thinking for too long, Ulligrassor followed Silgur, and he was sure he made the right choice.
Having become alien to each other, they parted, leaving in the place of the mass death of the Margalons and the Visgs a good memory of the brotherhood ruined by them. They walked to the same horizon, but they chose opposite directions. United by a common desire to find the Sirlebings, they could no longer stay together. Without any doubt or remorse, they renounced the community once formed by the Great Spirit.

- I think my chosen path is short, – Aurora confessed a year before her death, – and I can’t do anything.
Rudy didn’t want to answer her. All of his thoughts at that time were elsewhere – in the moment of their conflict with his father. For the first time, his father accused Rudy of carelessness and threatened to leave his son without his support. The father gave him a rich house, material support, able to satisfy any of his requests, to protect his personal space, rights and interests, but more importantly, he released his son from the onerous duty of being a provider. Imagining himself as a wise mentor, he created the perfect son in his mind, making every effort so that Rudy could study, be interested, evaluate, choose, refuse, ask, demand, manipulate, cheat, dodge, provoke, pit outsiders against each other, avoid trouble, and keep his defense by resorting to a complex lexicon, imbued at the time with a rare manner of deftly insulting. In return, he expected that all of his son’s skills would be channelled into his field of interest, which he had achieved in part. While obsessed with the process of forging a worthy successor, the father forgot or carelessly did not consider it important to explain to the son that all personal qualities are in themselves null and void if a person is unable to act. Rudy was unable to act and was severely limited in understanding what he really was.
But, no matter how far they were going and how high they were climbing, sobering times caught up with them. The father was disappointed in Rudy, who was no longer worthy of his pride as soon as he had a new son with his new wife. By adopting a father’s cynical attitude to people, Rudy became disillusioned with Aurora because it was convenient for him. He only kept in touch with her because he didn’t want to go into a new relationship with anyone else. On the other hand, he didn’t like what he had. Aurora was demanding, but Rudy wasn’t used to trying hard for somebody. Aurora needed substantial support, but he gave her exactly what it took to get her off his back. Usually, he was limited to a couple of clever, worthless sentences.
- Now I can stop, change my mind, and take a different direction, even if the new direction is completely unknown to me, – said Aurora.
She was waiting for his opinion, which she wanted to listen to.
- Stay in your place, – Rudy answered indifferently.
- It’s impossible.
- Then go wherever you want and there you’ll find what you need.
Rudy was impressed by his ingenuity. After a year, destroyed and deeply unhappy, painfully dependent on the image of the woman, who was already dead, balancing life and death in the cursed lands of Laldiroff, Rudy hated himself for those words, but his remorse couldn’t have saved him.
Chapter 22. The loyalty, which was treachery
Wurn has waited for the best of times. Moving in the right direction, shoulder to shoulder with Gallagud, without his horrible brothers, he felt a pure joy filling his weary gut. With awe, afraid of spooking the future, Wurn closely monitored the incremental changes of the present, and fully feeling how the desire of his life was being realized. The brothers, with their eternal troubles and the constant struggle against each other, were left behind. The eternal burden was resolved. In the end, as he dreamed, he was led by Gallagud, with whom even the plight was perceived as a great honour.
The right direction was not as easy and short as they had expected, but Wurn accepted with sincere gratitude even the most difficult stretch of the way where they were caught the famine previously denied by them. Every time Wurn looked at his beloved brother, he saw the same thing. Gallagud no longer cared about him. Exposing parts of his body, he viewed with horror the progressive changes. His skin resembled the ravaged flaps of Gargont clothing. Habitually denying the terrible in him, Gallagud scrutinized every inch of his withering body, and he didn't admit that he himself had become like Gargont.
- What can I do to make us feel better, brother? – asked Wurn.
Gallagud didn’t hear it. Suddenly, he had a terrible insight. Taking another hopeless step, with each bout of terrible starvation, he was convinced of his own horror – they’ll never find the Sirlebings, and the way to the home was lost to them forever because of Wurn.
Wurn did not want to move to the northwest. He simply followed his brother in his decisive choice, deceiving Gallagud and himself. Having become the helpless servant of his beloved brother, Wurn was unable to listen to himself, accepting other people’s desires as his own. At the most inconvenient moment, the spirit of Wurn was rebelling and confused their paths, but Wurn himself, as an insensitive person, did not feel the rebellion taking place inside him, blindly believing that these are the best times for them.
- Which direction do you really want? – asked Gallagud, trying to find a way to remedy their situation as soon as possible.
- That direction you lead us on, – answered Wurn with no doubt.
- You’re lying.
- I wouldn’t lie to you, brother.
- And you’re lying about that, too.
The unbreakable authority of one proved powerless against the simply servility of the other. Wisdom was not appropriate to resolve a fatal difficulty. Thinking a little less than usual, Gallagud assumed that he could gain the truth from Wurn by hurting him. It is only in a state of acute anxiety that the mind loses its strength and becomes defenceless to any onslaught. When suffering peaks, there is no room for deception and cunning. “Only then the truth will be cleansed from the vile dirt of deception”, – he believed.
With the dagger, which belonged to one of the killed Visgs, Gallagud snuck up to Wurn and, unable to muster his strength at the decisive moment, fell on his brother, holding the dagger in front of him. The accidental blow was fatal. The children of Aliel did not know one of the fundamental rules of the Father – their immortality ends at the moment when one brother attacked another with a weapon.
Having realized his involvement in Wurn’s death, and having unwittingly discovered what the Father was hidden from them, Gallagud went mad. The era of the leader of the wanderers collapsed ignominiously. The era of the most harmless self-deception.
For Wurn, the alliance with Gallagud was considered sacred. Upon his death, he had every right to be mourned by his brother and to be properly buried at the place of his own death. This right has been only partially realized.
Gallagud could not maintain control of himself. Famine consumed his essence. The wisdom and the nobility of the son of the Great Spirit were destroyed the only need. Not understanding the horror of his own act, and not feeling the slightest remorse, he assaulted Wurn’s body, raising the dagger over and over again to carve for himself pieces of warm flesh. Surprisingly, he didn’t take much.
By satisfy his hunger, Gallagud paid his respects to Wurn, grieving his own loss. He felt very bad without his brother, but at the same time very good for himself. With new powers and in a new capacity, Gallagud went further.

At the same time, when terrible changes occurred with Gallagud and Wurn, famine caught up with their brothers, who chose a different path for themselves. There was no difference between the two directions. Rudy was the most vulnerable among the others. He felt the pain in himself. His body howled, mourning the impending loss of Rudy’s life. His soul eagerly awaited the end of the excruciating journey to death. The powerlessness slowly stretched the flour.
The stamina of the wanderers caused him to feel his own insignificance and envy for their strength, agility, unique ability to survive.
- How can I help you? – Ulligrassor, who was unusually energetic, asked to Rudy.
- Share with me what you have left of your meal. I’m starving.
Before that, more than once, he had noticed that Ulligrassor had been eating his personal supplies of meal quickly and discreetly for the brothers. Silgur and Raron had nothing. Hunger tormented them in the same way as Rudy, but Ulligrassor claimed his suffering more often and louder than others.
- Forgive me, brother, but I can’t, – said Ulligrassor to Rudy, who, despite past lessons of interacting with Ulligrassor, he continued to expect something from a cunning man.
Swallowing a bitter sense of grievance – the only thing he could feel other than pain, Rudy humbly closed his eyes. He wanted to be left in peaceful solitude, perhaps forever. His expectation, for his own good, was destroyed by Raron.
Grabbing Ulligrassor of the breasts with one hand, Raron searched his brother for the venison. By cutting off half of the piece he found, and then he forcefully stuffed into Rudy’s mouth the humble prey that he found. Then, back to Ulligrassor, he said:
- Don’t give hope if you’re not gonna keep your promise.
Ulligrassor took his time in answering to Raron. Thinking a little about his position, he dared to defend his beliefs:
- I don’t have to be helpful to anyone. No one can help anyone in principle. It’s a blatant fallacy that I don't accept.
- Unwilling to be of any use to others, you exist because of the time, effort and sacrifice of people useful to you and the help of whom you willingly accept and often beg for about it. You fool, because you don’t even know why your Father punished you with this sickness. In this way from he marked for everyone your greed that has no limits!
Rudy did not know what the wanderers were arguing about further and what mutual reasons allowed them to reconcile. Having swallowed a piece of venison, overflowing with feelings and emotions, he temporarily lost consciousness and woke up hanging on Silgur’s shoulder. Behind, beside each other, were Ulligrassor and Raron. Looking at them, it was impossible to believe that they could quarrel at all. “So, it appeared to me”, – Rudy thought to himself and accepted what he was thinking.
They had to move forward. The Sirlebings' settlement was closer than they thought. In the distance, but within sight, there was something that couldn’t have arisen and stayed within Laldiroff, and it was wonderful.

- For the first and last time, I’m begging, no – I’m forcing you to be useful to me!
It was the day that Rudy found clarity on the one vital question for him. He decisively disappointed his father. Angry Rudolph-senior shouted to his son:
- I must know what information she has collected during the time you was in idleness, allowing the “Trojan horse” to invade our family business! Give me the keys to her apartment right now, and tomorrow night you will lead her anywhere, even to hell! Remember! Tomorrow’s night she shouldn’t return to her damn home!
Rudy was finally crushed. Appealing to the once-forgiving and all-permitting love of his father, he repeated the same thing:
- There's nothing there!
- You don’t notice anything, so you won’t have anything, Rudy! – screamed the father.
Rudolph-senior extended a hand to his son. Rudy gave the keys to father. As he was ordered, the following evening he and Aurora went to a forest house built at the behest of Rudolph-senior immediately after the death of his wife, for his, at that time, only son, so that little Rudy could learn the principle – “losing one, getting another”.
Leaving at that time all their frustrations, anxiety and expectations, Rudy and Aurora lay near each other’s, silent, without thinking too much. They lay still, listening to the strict rhythm of the stroke of the wall clock. It was also their lives that went from one scenario to the next. They both loved the sound of endless time. There, where he was far from his father’s frustration, anxiety, and expectations, Rudy felt that he loved Aurora. Then he didn’t need more for the happiness.
As they returned, he was scared that Aurora would feel something wrong and would not rest until he found the truth or something that pointed to the truth. He imagined the horror of the destruction and the mess – the consequences of the searching, because he knew well how his father treated other people’s things. What he saw, crossing the threshold of the apartment, struck him far more than the terrible expectations and colorful fantasies of a supposed disaster.
There was no visible sign of anyone in the apartment. Everything was in place. Absolutely nothing in the space around has shifted an inch. Aurora felt safe and quietly fussed over her mass of unfinished business. The trip to the forest cabin brought her back to her former state of carefree joy. For the first time in a long time, the meaning of her words was clear. The danger was passed. Rudy felt relief and thought with hope: “He found nothing”.
The ruthless truth that his father found what he wanted, Rudy realized at Aurora’s funeral. Looking at the reaction of her loyal friends and colleagues, when Rudolph-senior walked into the ceremonial hall, it was impossible not to notice – all of them was afraid him, not even daring to look in his direction.
Rudolph-senior arranged a lavish funeral for Aurora, investing his own money and soul in a poignant farewell ceremony. Fabulously beautiful, as if alive, she lay, under the lovely cover of fragrant white orchids. It was well paid for. The best makeup man hid the ugly traces of her death from prying eyes.
When people came to the coffin, they whispered to each other about the same thing:
“Great job! I wouldn’t never have thought she was blown up”.
“I wonder if the head was sewn back on or how it’s done”.
“Wow…”.
“I can’t believe it, but she’s beautiful”.
“What if they just laid her head without fixation, in the hope that everything will go smoothly anyway? One awkward move and we will witness a scandal with elements of shock. I love black humor”.
Having taken the place of the relatives that Aurora had no left, Rudolph-senior, surrounded by his new family, accepted the words of condolence. Rudy was grateful to his father for an unexpectedly broad, out-of-character gesture. At that time, in the grief, confusion and in anguish of the conflicted feelings pouring down on him, he did not realize that Rudolph-senior had also orchestrated Aurora’s death, and a little while later – an elaborate mockery of her memory with the active participation and personal contribution of her friends to the dirty story. But no matter how terrible were the people who killed Aurora and desecrated her memory, Rudy played a major and decisive role in the story.
Chapter 23. The Sirlebings
Rudy couldn’t believe the reality of the beauty that opened before his eyes. Deep down, he rejoiced. The long-forgotten feeling of warmth has returned to him, not long after having forced himself to accept that this ordinary gift of normalcy will never be given to him. The warm, evergreen edge oasis in the center of the harsh lands of primordial cold proved to be a gift of extraordinary reality. They found the place where the Sirlebings lived. The triumph of the warmth of life over the cold of death struck Silgur and Ulligrassor much harder, because they had never seen anything like it. Raron’s gaze was directed beyond the wonderful settlement – he looked with hope at the Black Rock, which resembled a small hill and was not black.
- This is the end of our journey, – he said.
- I can’t believe it, – said Silgur.
- There’s not a moment to lose, – said Ulligrassor, – it’s time we should have went to Kölkulla!
Silgur and Raron simultaneously replied: “No!”.
- Before we face the Keeper’s gaze, we must pay our respects to the Sirlebings, – Silgur explained.
The Sirlebings perceived with complete indifference to the visit of horribly looking strangers to their settlement. Each of them gave the wanderers immediate attention only in passing. At first glance, the Sirlebings were conscious. There were no indications in their eyes or actions that these common people were struck by a common mania. The humble routine of their day had quite understandable meaning – they didn’t live to survive, they just lived. Without trying to find more, the Sirlebings easily found what they needed. Not wanting anything out of the ordinary, they received everything they needed for a serene life.
Rudy couldn’t shake the impression that the Sirlebings were strikingly reminding him of the poor people he’d met during his old, normal life. At that time, he called them “spitting of civilization”. His father’s son, Rudy, was convinced that poverty was covered in mud on the person who had allowed it to happen, and that mud would be impossible to wash off. The Sirlebings, like those poor people, were purer than his thoughts, let alone the thoughts and deeds of his revered father.
The main responsibility of the Sirlebings all their life was the creation. That did not have the slightest useful, but the quiet simpletons created something beautiful, although that was not the main thing – they occupied themselves, thus each of them kept their fragile mind. During the rest days they did not go beyond the evergreen limits of their settlement, devoting their time and energy to fortification, beautification and, in rare cases, restoration of their modest dwellings. Their little houses suffered damage from the natural forces more often than the dwellings of the Gungs, the Margalons and the Visgs. On other days and hours, they went out to get a meal, raw materials and all the necessities of everyday life. Sometimes they went off to get something rare that useless for them, but which they wanted it very much. Everything the Sirlebings needed and wanted was waiting for them where they wanted to find it. They knew they were getting gifts from someone who existed above them, in gratitude for their endless creative work. This work consisted of an elaborate sculpting of figures and patterns on the Black Rock. Generations after generation, the Sirlebings carved out a record of hard life in the expanses of Laldiroff, and because of their efforts, looking at the Black Rock, everyone could find an answer to their own question.
Having tasted warm food for the first time, that was warmed up in a hot spring, the wanderers felt sick. At first, it frightened them deeply, but then they realized what it was like to feel relaxed body and calm mind. Each of the Sirlebings expressed his desire to shelter them. The children of Aliele were unreservedly received and revered as respected guests by them. The wanderers have finally found the long-awaited peace.
- I’m afraid to think what you might do to them, – quietly addressing to Silgur confessed Rudy.
- Nothing, – Silgur answered more quietly, – we will not abuse the hospitality of these fine people.
- How is that possible?
- We must leave things as they are. This is a case where wisdom and the right decision lie in non-interference. The Sirlebings have found what our older brothers, the Gargonts, did not give them. They are what we see them to be, and they are better than us.
The last extraordinary happening occurred in the hour when the wanderers were saying goodbye to the Sirlebings. Gallagud appeared in the settlement. On his clothes, hands, face there was blood of Wurn. His mad eyes looked towards the Black Rock. In a crazy rush, he fell and aggressively fought off the Sirlebings who wanted to help him. In a stubborn move towards the goal, Gallagud walked past the brothers without even noticing them. His purpose was to meet with Kölkulla. He wanted to tell her his truth and to give the Father a just verdict.
Raron followed him, but kept his distance from Gallagud. Silgur did not want followed the brothers. After waiting for Gallagud and Raron to go very far, and having told the Sirlebings the last words of gratitude, he patted Rudy on the shoulder and happily said: “It’s time”. Then he looked at Ulligrassor and realized that Ulligrassor would not go any further with them.
- I stay here, – said Ulligrassor, – that’s what my soul tells me. I don’t know what our home is, and I don’t want to imagine, speculate, hope and expect anymore. I’m fine here, and this place can be my home if I want it. And I want it!
Without resentment at each other, the brothers parted forever, so that each of them would find a happy ending to a century-old ordeal. They were too different – they didn’t want the same thing. Silgur and Ulligrassor got what they wanted. Rudy got what he couldn’t refuse.
Chapter 24. The gaze of Kölkulla
- Who came up with the idea of calling a white hill the Black Rock? And why did everyone support that?
Silgur was silent. He looked with anxiety into the forward. He had to face what he feared most. At the foot of the Black Rock, with a dagger in his back, there was a dead Gallagud.
Silgur did not need the truth. Without stopping Raron and without following the brothers, he knew how their last journey would end. He knew and was forced to accept it.
With tears in his eyes, Silgur pulled a dagger from his brother’s body and dragged Gallagud to the site of the Black Rock where the story of his and his brothers appearing on the lands of Laldiroff was carved. Gallagud found his eternal resting place in the grave, at the feet of a huge figure of the Great Spirit Aliel.
Raron waited for them deep beneath the Black Rock. In a dark cave, he stood near a small ice wall, holding the massive stone spears in his hands. He silently gave one spear to Silgur. Without conspiring, they began to break the ice carefully.
Rudy was impressed. Soon, the efforts of the wanderers made sense to him. In the thickness of the ice, a true miracle was hidden. From a long, cold confinement, they freed the beautiful face of Kölkulla. Opening her eyes, she first saw Rudy. Faced with her gaze Rudy was tense. Apparently, she knew everything about him.
- You’ve been a long time getting here, – said Kölkulla, – but a simple and short way for you was impossible because you immediately trusted the first false impression. Do you recognize centuries of suffering as redemption for your own mistake?
- We recognize that, – said Silgur.
- What do you want in return, the wise son of the Great Spirit?
- I want peace and oblivion. Not the illusions that Migurnock has bestowed upon me, but the simple eternal oblivion. I want to disappear. All I want is for everything I know to disappear, as if it never happened, no, and it never will.
- And what do you want, the Great Spirit Aliel? – asked Kölkulla looking at Raron.
- I wish peace and oblivion for Silgur.
- Then I have to find out what the little man wants, – said Kölkulla not to Rudy, but to the Great Spirit.
- He wants an easy death for himself, – said Aliel, and he was right.
Upon hearing this, Kölkulla began laughing sinister. Silgur and Aliel laughed with her.
- Is it possible to give an easy death to someone who is already dead? I will say – no. To the one who has died in agony, an easy death is not to be expected.
