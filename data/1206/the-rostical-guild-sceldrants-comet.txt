Chapter 1: Sceldrant's Comet

*A mature man dressed in dancer-like clothes stepped forward and glanced across a poorly lit room, staring at a few dozen people sitting in different positions.*

?????: *He slowly exhaled and observed the crowd, smiling at the children, teenagers and young adults in a proud-like manner.* "You all are the next generation-."

*The man placed his hands behind his back and slowly walked across the room, causing the people's eyes to follow.*

?????: "Every year, we perform The Purafetic Ceremony. Do any of you know why-?"

*A young boy eagerly waved his hand in the air, catching the surrounding people's attention.*

?????: *He looked at the boy and smiled, facing him in a curious-like manner.* "Yes, Karol?"

Karol: "Uhm, it's to ensure nuffing bad happens to the citee?"

?????: *He chuckled and shook his head as if Karol was incorrect.* "No-"

*A young teenager with pink hair rolled her eyes, glancing at Karol in a disgusted-like manner.*

?????: "You're so stupid, Karol."

Karol: "B-Be quiet, Trinity-"

Trinity: *She raised an eyebrow and looked to her side, staring at her identical twin sister with blue hair.* "I have to be quiet, Infinity."

Infinity: "And quiet you must be?"

Trinity and Infinity: "Harh harh-" *They giggled at the same time.*

?????: *He stepped forward, catching the twin sister's attention.* "Trinity, Infinity, that's enough. Karol is your cousin-"

Trinity and Infinity: "Sorry, Cortax.."

Karol: (Thanks, dad.)

Cortax: *He nodded his head and glanced across the room, watching several men in ritual-like garments walk out of the room.* (It might be tedious, but we have to ensure the doors are closed at all times.)

Karol: *He stared at the men, noticing dark shadows behind them.* (The moonlight is stwong.)

Cortax: *He watched two stone doors close behind the men on its own accord, allowing him to focus back on the crowd.* "We perform the ceremony to keep the quality of our Rostical at its highest."

Trinity: *She stared at Cortax, mumbling to herself in thought.* (Cortax is one of the strongest dancers in the city. I respect him a lot-)

Karol: "Why can't we perform the seramony too?"

Cortax: "You are all too young. The sheer level of Neurons will overpower you."

Karol: "Neurons?"

Trinity: "We don't have time to discuss how Rostical works."

Infinity: "Time we don't have." *She looked at Trinity, nodding her head in agreement.*

Karol: "But-?"

Cortax: "They're right, Karol." *He looked to his side and watched several women sway their arms in a dance-like manner, causing the walls to light up.*

*Glyphic-like drawings on the walls flashed, causing the two stone doors to open up, allowing moonlight outside to glow into the room.*

Trinity: "Can we at least watch?"

Cortax: "No-"

*A man rushed into the room and looked at Cortax in a worried-like manner, nodding his head.*

Cortax: (It's ready-) *He looked at Karol and smiled, before slowly walking towards the door.*

Trinity: "Where are you going?"

Cortax: "I have to begin the ceremony-"

Karol: "But, Dad! I-I know the seramony is important, but why did you gather us all here?"

Trinity: (I found that strange too. Those who are too young to perform the ceremony are usually asleep in their rooms by now, and-)

*Trinity looked up and observed the ancient appearing stone room in a curious-like manner.*

Trinity: (Why are we all kept in a Reality Marble?)

Cortax: "I will see you all soon." *He spoke in an abrupt-like manner and looked towards the door, nodding his head at the man.*

Karol: (Dad?) *He whimpered in thought and watched Cortax leave the room, causing the stone doors to close behind him.*

----------

*A teenager dressed in black clothing and dark make-up sat on a park bench by herself, watching cars drive by with an emotionless face.*

?????: *She tilted her head back and stared at a clear blue sky with an emotional frown.* (Everything.. Everything.. I hate everything..)

*The teenager looked down and stared at cut-like scars on her wrists, causing her to cover them up with her long sleeved shirt.*

?????: (I don't show it, but I know what everyone thinks of me, aye.. Luna's a loser, Luna's pathetic, she's a nobody..)

*Luna looked back up and frowned in thought, trying not to show any emotion.*

Luna: (I'm sick of everything bad happenin' to me..) *She looked back down, intensely staring at her lap.* (You only live to love.. Without love-)

?????: "'Sup?" *A man spoke in a deep voice, as he casually jogged up to the bench.*

Luna: "Huh?" *She looked up and stared at the man, causing her cheeks to blush.* (I-It's him! I've had a crush on him since, forever!-)

?????: *He stopped and stared at Luna, raising an eyebrow in confusion.* "Ah..?"

Luna: *She coughed and shook her head, hiding her excitement from the man.* "Carlo.. Nothin' much."

Carlo: *He plunked himself on the bench next to Luna, looking at her, intrigued.* "So, what are ya doing?"

Luna: "J-Just chillin', aye." *She spoke in a nervous-like manner, slightly avoiding eye contact.*

Carlo: "Well-" *He smirked and shuffled closer to Luna, causing her face to turn a darker shade of red.* "You want to go the Sceldrant Comet ball?"

Luna: "M-Me?!"

Carlo: "Yaha, yeah?"

Luna: *She smiled awkwardly as if she hadn't smiled in a while.* "Yes!"

Carlo: "Kool, I'll see ya tomorrow night then?" *He stood up, facing Luna with a smirk.*

Luna: "Y-Yea!"

Carlo: "Righto, see ya then! Don't forget, it starts early!" *He waved and turned around, casually jogging back on his path.*

Luna: (Ohmagawd, he spoke to me! No! He asked me to the comet's ball!-)

*Luna's mobile phone started to ring, causing her to pick it out of her pocket and answer it.*

Luna: "'Sup, Kylie?" *She covered her other ear, trying to ignore the sounds of the passing cars.*

Kylie: "Wanna come ova? Kerry will be comin' ova too."

Luna: "Tonight?"

Kylie: "Yea?"

Luna: "OK."

Kylie: "'Kay. Come 'round, whenever, aye."

Luna: "Yea. Oi! Guess wat!"

Kylie: "What?!"

Luna: "Well-" *She lowered her arm and touched the phone, causing it to end the call.* "Aha." *She smirked evil-like, as if she intended to hang up in mid-sentence.*

----------

*A woman laughed on a mobile phone before walking into a family-friendly fast food restaurant.*

?????: "For example.. Hello, my name is Ashton Lawyer. I'm twenty years old and I'm currently a Shift Assistant at Fast Food Enterprise and have been working here since I was fifteen. Now, what you're not allowed to ask is their marital status or anything like that. Okay, Lance?"

Lance: *He looked up and stared at Ashton who stood beside him.* "Yea, yea. Sorry-"

Ashton: "Please, say it again-"

Lance: *He moaned and pouted like a grumpy child.* "Gettin' trained up to be a manager is pretty exhaustin', bah."

Ashton: "Oh, come on, just say it exactly how I just said it to you..." *He sat down on a chair opposite to Lance.*

Lance: "Dear oh dear..... Ahem, hello my name is Lance Lighten, I'm twenty one years old."

Ashton: *He silently nodded his head, as he stared at Lance in thought.* (Good-)

Lance: "I'm currently a trainee Shift Supervisor at Fast Food Enterprise and it's delicious."

Ashton: "Good grief, Lance, at least try. This is the only way we are able to work in the same store. If you get promoted then neither of us need to get transferred, since well, we have been best friends since I could remember.... Hey?"

Lance: "OK OK, sorry, well only for you I suppose I will do the homework. When is it?"

Ashton: "Wednesday."

Lance: "I will be ready for the manager induction with Twortz." *He rolled his eyes.*

Ashton: "Thanks, I'll see you tomorrow morning around eleven thirty then? I'll be present when Twortz will assess you-"

*A female customer walked in and brushed the wrinkles out of her skirt, as she made her way to the front counter.*

Lance: *He whistled with a cheesy smile.* "Oi-"

Ashton: "That is unacceptable!"

Lance: "Wat?"

Ashton: "Have respect for everyone, good flaming grief!"

Lance: "I was jokin' OK OK gee."

Ashton: *He sighed.* "Well my shift is about to start, I have four to twelve." *He lifted himself off the chair and tucked his shirt in.*

Lance: (To think a nerd is my best friend.) *He sighed.* "Well, I'm gonna go then, so later." *He stood up and started to walk towards the exit of the restaurant.*

*A man with many pimples on his face discreetly observed Ashton and Lance from behind a display cabinet on the front counter.*

?????: (Seriously-) *He watched Lance leave the restaurant, causing him to pout in a jealous-like manner.* (Why does Ashton even hang out with him-?)

*A woman dressed in business attire noticed the man staring at Ashton through the display fridge on front counter.*

?????: "Tyler?" *She spoke in a professional-like manner, slowly walking up to him.*

Tyler: "T-Twortz." *He quickly stood up straight and faced Twortz, awkwardly picking at one of the many pimples on his face.*

Twortz: "Don't you have some duties to attend to?"

Tyler: "Y-Yes." *He spoke with a squeal and nervously nodded his head, rushing towards the back of the restaurant.*

Twortz: "Don't forget to wash your hands."

Tyler: "R-Right!" *He squealed in acknowledgement, picking up several garbage bags.*

Twortz: (Tyler, he's a good worker, but sometimes, he doesn't know how to express himself.)

Ashton: *He walked behind the counter and smiled at Twortz, staring at her back.* "Good evening, Twortz."

Twortz: "Ashton." *She spoke with a smile and turned around, walking towards him.*

Ashton: "Before I begin my shift, shall we check on the monthly reports in the manager's office?"

Twortz: "Yes. As per usual, Dee Highs-" *She waved her hand across the kitchen, symbolising she spoke about the store.* "Our performance has skyrocketed."

Ashton: "Really?" *He slowly walked towards the office, smiling at Twortz in shock.*

Twortz: "What's with the shocked face, Ashton? You put a lot of work into this store, it's only obvious that it'll eventually show."

----------

*Lance dragged his feet along the pavement, enduring the scorching heat.*

Lance: "Hot.. Hot.. Hot.. Gah.." *He groaned on his breath, slowly making his way home.*

----------

*Cortax made his way towards an enormous courtyard, lit up by the bright moonlight.*

Cortax: *He watched villagers dance near different console-like objects, causing their lights to glow.* "What's the report, Victoria?"

Victoria: *She stopped dancing, causing a purple glyphic-like platform underneath her to disappear.* "They're almost here."

Cortax: "They are?" *He spoke in a worried-like manner and stared at two pillars at the entrance of the city, watching them glow blue due to the moonlight.*

Victoria: *She looked past Cortax and stared at a massive stone wall, harbouring many doors on different levels.* "Are all the children safe?"

Cortax: "Yes. They're in the Reality Marble used for practising Ougis."

Victoria: *She silently stared at Cortax, taking a moment to collect her thoughts.* "Whatever happens tonight-"

Cortax: "We may be up against the Consultants, but we, The Sacred Dancers are something to be feared!"

Victoria: *She hesitantly nodded her head and focused her attention to the entrance.* "I will keep everyone informed of their Neuron signature."

Cortax: *He looked over Victoria's shoulder, staring into the far distance.* (They're not even hiding it..)

Victoria: (Besides me and Cortax, we've got two other masters. Normally, an experienced Rostic Dancer can handle a captain levelled warrior.. But, to face the actual Consultants..)

Cortax: *He walked past Victoria and proudly took a deep breath.* "Everyone, begin your dances and incantations! I want us to be ready!" (.. Just in case.)

Victoria: *She turned around and stared at Cortax's back, sighing in a worried-like manner.* (We're not even sure what has sparked the Consultant's recent fascination with us, but tonight..)

----------

*Luna sat in a small room with two other teenagers dressed in black clothing.*

Luna: "Kerry, Kylie, wat's the big deal?"

Kylie: *She smirked and wiped black lipstick around her lips, glancing at a larger woman covered in dark make-up.* "Kerry, show her."

Kerry: "This-" *She reached into a black handbag and pulled out a small container of tablets with a medical sticker tapped on the side.*

Luna: "Wat's that?"

Kerry: "These are the pills-" *She threw the container at Luna and reached into the bag, revealing another two containers.*

Luna: "The pills?" *She shook the container, listening to the pills jingle.*

Kylie: *She reached over and grabbed one of the containers off Kerry, eagerly screwing off the lid.* "That will free us of this world."

Luna: "R-Really?" *She spoke on her breath, staring at the container in her hand with widening eyes.*

Kerry: "These are prescriptions I stole from my mum."

Luna: "Kerry-Anne?" *She spoke in disbelief.*

Kylie: *She raised her hand, staring at a small blue pill.* "With this, I can end my suffering-"

Kerry: "Our suffering."

Luna: "Yea.."

Kerry: *She pulled her sleeve up, revealing freshly cut lines across her arm.* "I hate my life."

Luna: *She placed the contained in her pocket and picked up a knife, nodding her head.* "I hate love."

Kylie: "I hate myself."

----------

*A bulky man holding a sword in one hand ran through a vibrant forest, lit up by bright moonlight.*

?????: "Get back, you warrior scum!" *He shouted over his shoulder, watching a party of warriors in black armour chase after him.*

Warrior: "Get back here, Nathan!" *He shouted and raised a bow, pulling on the string.*

Nathan: (Damn, I wasn't expecting warriors to be in that village-) *He skilfully leapt to the side and hid behind a thick tree, watching an arrow fly past.*

Warrior: (Missed!) *He grunted in thought, unintentionally shaking the bow in frustration.*

Female Warrior: *She stared at the warrior's back, noticing a number scratched on his armour.* "Thirty-Three, you missed!"

Warrior: *He turned around, lowering the bow.* "He's quick."

Female Warrior: "Who cares, let's get after him before the captain gets here!"

Warrior: "Sure!" *He grunted in agreement and raised the bow, focusing his attention back to the tree.*

----------

Ashton: *He cleaned the front counter and looked up, watching Tyler mop the floors.* "Keep up the good work, Tyler."

Tyler: "Th-Thank you." *He smiled, mopping the floors more enthusiastically.*

?????: "Ashton!"

Ashton: *He focused his attention to the kitchen.* "Rachael?"

Rachael: "Ashton, please."

Ashton: "Coming." *He quickly walked down a production line containing different types of freshly cut ingredients in stainless steel containers.*

Rachael: "A-Ashton, there's something wrong with one of these machines." *She sounded preoccupied, as she focused all her attention on the back of two sundae machines.*

Ashton: "What's wrong?" *He watched Rachael move around the machines as if she was trying to listen to something.*

Rachael: "One of them is making a horrible screechy sound."

Ashton: "Screechy sound?" *He walked up to Rachael, inspecting the side of the machine.* "It's the fan."

Rachael: "The fan?" *She leant closer to Ashton, causing his cheeks to blush.*

Ashton: "Yes. Sounds like there's stuff inside." *He spoke in a casual manner as if it was normal.*

Rachael: "I thought it was designed so it blows away all types of debris in the air?"

Ashton: "Although that is true, some dirt can still get inside it."

Rachael: "How? The fan blows out." *She placed her hand on the machine, feeling the wind blow through the cracks of her fingers.*

Ashton: "From experience, I've noticed certain types of soft dirt-like dust bypass the fans."

Rachael: "But, Ash-" *She coughed and shook her head.* "I mean, Ashton. I don't understand how that works?"

Ashton: "Well, it's hard to explain-"

Tyler: *He mopped the front counter floors and placed the mop in the bucket.* "Almost done-"

*Tyler lifted the mop out of the bucket and accidentally hit the sundae toppings behind him, causing a tub to roll off the machine.*

Tyler: "O-Oops!" *He gasped with a squeal, covering his mouth in shock.*

Rachael: *She watched the tub roll off the machine in the corner of her eye, causing her to instantly react and catch it with one hand.* "Gotcha-"

Ashton: "Good save-" (Must be from her Hapkido.) *He watched a wave of topping sway into the machine, causing it to screech.*

Tyler: "S-Sorry, guys!"

Ashton: "It's okay, Tyler. Continue the floors, we got it here."

Tyler: "Alright!" *He spoke over the sundae machine and exhaled slowly, continuing to mop the floor.*

Ashton: *He reached over Rachael and placed the tub back into the dispenser.* "See?"

Rachael: *She looked at Ashton with blushing cheeks and stared at the machine, watching the cookie dust-like topping jam in the fan.* "Wow. How?"

Ashton: *He smiled at Rachael in a caring-like manner.* "It's the texture and density of the debris. It sort of cushions itself from the swirling fans, while being too dense for it to be repelled back."

Rachael: "Th-That's intriguing." *She spoke on her breath and smiled, as if it was hard to breathe.*

Ashton: *He coughed and stepped back, acting in a professional-like manner.* "Tyler, could you please ensure all the registers are logged out and Rachael, could you please ensure that all windows are locked."

Tyler: "Yep."

Rachael: "Yes, Ashton." *She blushed with a slight smile.*

----------

Cortax: *He looked across the courtyard, noticing glowing glyphic platforms underneath each dancer.* "Okay-"

Victoria: *She paused in mid-step, suddenly gasping with widening eyes.* "C-Cortax!"

Cortax: *He quickly turned around in an urgent-like manner, intensely staring at Victoria.* "What's happening?"

Victoria: "They've approached the city."

Cortax: *He gritted his teeth and frowned, glancing to each side.* (Lehi and Valentine aren't here yet!-)

--

*A warrior in platinum armour walked down an ancient-like road, closely followed by a woman wearing glasses and a man with short black hair.*

?????: "Cassandra, are there any Remenistal traps?" *She spoke with a smirk, pushing up her glasses with one hand.*

Cassandra: "No, ma'am."

?????: "Isn't this exciting, Ridley?"

Ridley: *He looked to his side, noticing the moonlight shine off her glasses.* "Yes, Kath."

Cassandra: (I am but a mere captain, and I'm travelling with both Consultants.)

Kath: *She noticed two glowing pillars in the distance, causing her to squint her eyes in determination.* "Is that the entrance?"

Cassandra: "Yes, ma'am."

Kath: "Finally."

Ridley: "On the contrary, I quite enjoyed the night stroll from Sorrowprax."

Kath: "Hmm." *She grunted in acknowledgement, glancing at Cassandra's platinum armour.* "Captain, you understand the severity of this mission?"

Cassandra: "Y-Yes, ma'am. This is an S classed mission-"

Kath: *She raised her hand, causing Cassandra to prematurely stop what she was saying.* "Excellent. That's all I wanted to know."

Ridley: *He smirked, covering one of his eyes in excitement.* (Even with my power, I will need Kath by my side to take down these master dancers.)

--

Victoria: *She swayed her arms in a dance-like manner in front of her face, causing two small glyphs to rotate in front of her eyes.* "I see, three of them." *She spoke in a military-like manner, staring at Cassandra, Kath and Ridley with heightened vision.*

Cortax: "Everyone, the last thing we want is to start violence, but be on guard!"

Men and Women: "Yes, sir!" *They spoke at the same time, watching Cassandra, Kath and Ridley step into the courtyard.*

Cortax: *He puffed out his chest and faced Kath, Ridley and Cassandra with a proud facial expression.* "Consultants-"

Cassandra: *She stepped forward, catching Cortax's attention.* "Don't speak to the Consultants like that!-"

Kath: "It is fine." *She spoke in a carefree manner and stepped forward, causing Cassandra to look confused.*

Cassandra: "Ma'am?"

Ridley: "Stand down, captain. This will be a fight out of your league."

Cassandra: "F-Fight? But I thought we were just-"

Kath: "Hmm? Questioning a Consultant?"

Cassandra: "N-No-"

Kath: "Do you want to be terminated?"

Cassandra: *She gritted her teeth and lowered her arms in a defeated-like manner, as if she knew her place.* "..."

Ridley: "Well?"

Cassandra: "My apologies." *She lowered her head and shuffled back, watching Kath and Ridley walk further into the courtyard.*

Ridley: "Now, let's talk business, Cortax Upper-"

Kath: *She stood by Ridley's side, glaring at Victoria in an evil-like manner.* "And, Victoria Stranger."

----------

Ashton: *He flicked all the switches off on the power board and made his way to the front counter. Tyler and Rachael spoke to themselves as they waited for his return.* "What's the time?"

Rachael: "Quarter past twelve."

Ashton: "Well all procedures are completed, let's call it a night then?"

Rachael: "Yeah." *She smiled, which caused Ashton to smile.*

Ashton: "Thank you both for your good work today."

Tyler and Rachael: "You're welcome."

*Ashton locked the restaurant and the party made their way to Ashton's silver car.*

Rachael: "Did you guys hear about Sceldrant's Comet?"

Tyler: "Of course!" *He opened the door and jumped in the back seat.*

Rachael: "Melinda won't stop talking about it, she's got me all excited about the event."

Tyler: "Who's Melinda?"

Ashton: "You work with her-" *He turned the key and the engine roared.* "She works on front counter?" *He looked in the mirrors and drove out of the car park.*

Rachael: "You know Mel? Melinda? Melinda Hambridge?"

Tyler: *He leant slightly forward, as Ashton drove over a speed bump.* "Oh, now I remember, yeah what about her?"

Rachael: "Well, we have Twortz's permission, and she'll even be attending." *She spoke with excitement, as she stared out the window.*

Ashton: "Twortz's permission for what exactly?"

Rachael: "Me, Mel and Twortz are going to watch the comet on the roof at work, would you both like to come?"

Ashton: "Of course, I have to see what all the commotion is about."

Tyler: "I have a late shift so I will be there anyway."

Rachael: "Sweet, sounds great."

*Ashton pulled up into a driveway and Tyler unfastened his seatbelt.*

Tyler: "Th-Thank you for the lift, so I will see you both Wednesday?" *He smiled, as he got out of the car.*

Rachael: "Yep."

Ashton: "We will see you then, goodnight." *He watched Tyler enter his house.*

Rachael: "I live just down the street so-" *She grabbed the door handle.*

Ashton: "No that is unacceptable, I will not allow you to walk at night."

Rachael: "But-"

Ashton: "It's not like we're kids anymore, how we could just play around on the streets at night."

Rachael: "I know, okay. You know I'm nineteen, I'm only a year younger than you so you don't always have to look out for me."

Ashton: "It doesn't matter how old you are, there are a lot of bad people out there."

Rachael: "Yes." *She smiled at Ashton.*

Ashton: *He smirked, as he drove up to Rachael's house.* "Okay, see you Wednesday."

Rachael: "Thanks, Ash."

Ashton: *He watched Rachael walk inside her house with a smile.* (It was good working with you Rach-)

*Ashton pulled out of the driveway and shook his head with satisfaction.*

Ashton: *He yawned as he drove towards his house.* (So this is my life... For the past few years, I've watched this once peaceful suburb, turn into a fearful criminal town.)

*Flames flickered in several bins on the street, catching Ashton's attention.*

Ashton: "People lack respect these days." *He grumbled to himself and sighed as he turned down his street.* (No respect at all-) *He pulled up into his driveway and walked inside the house.*

----------

Nathan: *He jumped past several trees and ran into a clearing, noticing an orange sky from the rising sun.* (Damn, who are they trying to impress?! They should've given up by now-)

Warrior: "Oi!" *He jumped into the clearing and ran towards Nathan, raising a rusty sword above his head.*

Nathan: *He faced the warrior and tightened his grip on his long sword, readying himself to attack.* "Looks like I have no choice but to use my Azure Bursts-"

Warrior: "Be quiet, you scum!" *He stepped into striking distance, quickly holding the sword with both hands.* "Harh!"

Nathan: *He frowned and focused, causing his body to glow a shade of blue.* "Double Slash."

Warrior: *He gasped with widening eyes and quickly jumped back, watching Nathan swing the sword twice at incredible speeds.* "An Azure Burst?!"

Nathan: "Stand back!-"

*An arrow shot through the forest and into the clearing, soaring towards Nathan.*

Nathan: "Double Slash." *He quickly sliced the sword downwards and across, causing a spark to flash off the arrow's head.* "Ha! Blocked it!"

Warrior: *He watched the arrow spiral in the air, landing next to Nathan's feet.* (He's skilled-)

Thirty-Three: *He staggered into the clearing and lowered the bow.* "How-?"

Warrior: "You two are late." *He grunted, watching a female and male warrior stagger towards him.*

Female Warrior: "We're the only ones out of our entire platoon that was able to keep up."

Nathan: *He smirked and raised the sword, ignoring the sweat which dripped off his chin.* "Any more takers-?"

*A man suddenly appeared in front of the three warriors, landing on one knee.*

Nathan: "Who-?"

Female Warrior: "A flashstep?"

Warrior: *He noticed the number nine scratched on the warrior's platinum armour, causing him to quickly bow to one knee.* "C-Captain!"

Nathan: (Damn! A captain!) *He gritted his teeth and stepped back, watching the captain slowly stand up.*

Captain: "Who's this, dirty lamp?!" *He chuckled like a mad scientist.*

Female Warrior: "Dirty lamp?" *She whispered on her breath.* "Captain, that's a disgusting word to use-"

Captain: "Zayden doesn't care what anyone says!"

Nathan: "A captain that swears? Have the Consultants become desperate-?"

Zayden: "Shut it, dirty lamp!" *He reached over his shoulder and pulled forward, causing a swirl of sparks to scatter around a large spear.*

Nathan: *He stared at the spear in Zayden's hand, causing him to frown.* (A captain classed warrior has the ability to conceal their weapon inside special Astragon pockets.. And depending on his ranking, he may even be able to use Rostical-)

Zayden: *He chuckled and licked his lips, pointing the spear at Nathan.* "Should I slit your-?"

Thirty-Three: "All respect, captain. The Consultants have requested him alive."

Zayden: "Tssk." *He spat to the side in disgust, as if he was displeased with the information.* "Why?"

Thirty-Three: "They wish to know more about Scoldrant Users."

Zayden: "Those feral things-?"

Nathan: "Are we going to fight, or not?" *He shouted, pointing the sword at Zayden.*

Zayden: (That dirty lamp.) *He discreetly frowned in a serious-like manner, causing his eyes to glow an eerie yellow colour.*

Nathan: (His eyes-?!)

Warrior: (What a fool.) *He looked up, staring at Nathan in an unimpressed-like manner.* (He may be skilled with the sword, but to challenge a captain-?)

Zayden: *He stepped forward and flashstepped behind Nathan, causing two slash-like sparks to scatter off his sword.* "Bring him to Sorrpowprax immediately!"

Thirty-Three: *He noticed Zayden standing behind Nathan.* (Wow-)

Female Warrior: "But he's still stand-?"

Nathan: "Fast-" *He dropped his sword and suddenly fell to his knees, collapsing face-first into the dirt ground.*

Zayden: "Now!"

Thirty-Three, Female and Male Warrior: "Sir!"

Nathan: "Damn.." *He mumbled under his breath, slowly falling unconscious.*

----------

*Every sound echoed inside a large warehouse which sounded like a sport's hall.*

Ashton: *He walked inside the warehouse and noticed Lance standing with other people, forming a line.* "So what did I miss?" *He walked up to Lance and smiled, joining the line.*

Rachael: *She walked in front of the line, facing them in a curious-like manner.* (I have a feeling this will be another awesome paintball fight.)

Lance: "You have an option of pickin' three items, one is a sword, shooter and a shield. All of 'em are over there." *He glanced at Ashton and pointed to a table, drawing his attention towards it.*

Ashton: *He walked over to the table.* (So it seems all the shooters have been taken and only one person took the sword.)

Rachael: *She discreetly watched Ashton lean over the table with a smile.* (Ash..)

Ashton: (And nobody touched the shields. Looks like I have no choice then.) *He grabbed one of the shields lined at the far right and walked back into line.*

Lance: *He looked down and noticed the shield in Ashton's arms.* (A shield? Seriously-?)

Ashton: *He noticed a sword by Lance's side.* "I see you're the one that got the sword, haha aren't we the odd ones out?" *He lifted up his shield with an awkward smile.*

*A few guys at the end of the line laughed amongst each other, as they pointed towards Lance and Ashton.*

Rachael: "Okay, so the rules for today are standard, are there any new people in the group? If so, please raise your hand."

*Nobody raised their hands, causing Rachael to nod her head.*

Rachael: "Okay, there are thirty-three combatants. There are two ways of winning, when twenty minutes are up, everyone is to line back here and whoever has the least amount of paint wins."

Player: *He raised his arm before speaking.* "Is that all?"

Rachael: *She shook her head.* "Or, if everyone is covered with paint before time is up, then the last person wins. Any questions?"

Teenager: "Yeah, why is a hot little chick like you running a place like this?"

Rachael: "Why are you here? Do you have a permission slip from your parents or guardian?"

Teenager: "..." *His friends giggled at him, causing him to look away in a defeated-like manner.*

Rachael: "Alright, there is a first and second winner prize. We will issue out these white shirts." *A man started to hand out white shirts to everyone.* "And one last thing, play fairly. You all have thirty seconds to get ready after the buzzer. You will get disqualified if you leave the boundaries."

Lance: *He squinted his eyes and stared at Rachael with confusion.* "Isn't she that chick from our work?"

Ashton: "Yeah, Rachael has two jobs, she works here every Tuesday-"

Lance: "Why?"

Ashton: "Because her dad does office work, so she comes out to cover for him."

Lance: "Wateva."

Rachael: "Could I get all of you to position yourselves outside. Each person will be supplied with one litre of black paint, and don't worry it's user-friendly."

*All the players started to walk outside, causing them to scatter across the arena to hide.*

Rachael: *She noticed Ashton and Lance.* "Hey, Ashton." *She walked up to them and smiled, brushing her hair back.* "And.. Lance."

Ashton: "Hello, Rachael."

Lance: "'Sup?"

Rachael: *She noticed the sword and shield in their hands.* "Too bad guys."

Lance: "Ah wateva." *He rudely grunted and walked outside.*

Ashton: "Lance usually fails sometimes-"

Rachael: "Fails sometimes? Hehehe."

Ashton: "Haha, but when it comes to these type of things.. I always end up underestimating him."

Rachael: "Okay." *She giggled and blushed.*

Lance: *He glanced across the arena and noticed different shaped blocks.* (Where to hide?)

*Speakers which were placed high on poles started to play music loudly.*

Rachael: *Her smile faded, as she became alert to the music.* "You better get in position it's starting."

Ashton: "Okay.. Oh and Rachael, thanks for letting us in." *He raised the shield, as he walked outside.*

Rachael: "Hehe, of course." (Good luck, Ash.) *She pushed a button on a control box and a loud buzzing sound echoed throughout the arena.* "Begin!"

Ashton: *He ran up to Lance who hid behind a stack of multi-coloured boxes.* "Are we teaming up?"

Lance: "Was that even a question?"

Ashton: "Okay it was, it will be better-"

*Two teenagers ran across the opening and were shot from all angles.*

Rachael: *The speakers which played the music, faded into silence.* "Out." *Her voice caused the two teenagers to walk back into the waiting area, as the music started to play again.*

Ashton: (Their shirts were completely saturated within four seconds.) "Lance, what are you doing?"

----------

*Luna walked into her bathroom and slowly closed the door behind her, glaring at the mirror as if she was afraid.*

Luna: "I-I hate lookin' at myself." *She whispered to herself and walked up to the mirror, staring at her image with an emotionless face.*

*Luna slowly grabbed the bottom of her shirt and took it off, instantly revealing the numerous cuts all over her body.*

Luna: *She threw her shirt onto the floor and leant forward, placing her hands on the side of the sink.* "No matter how many times I wax or shave, I'm always hairy! A girl shouldn't look like a gorilla!"

*Luna started to heave, causing sweat to run down her forehead.*

Luna: "And I always sweat. I'm so disgusting-"

?????: "Is everything alright in there, hun?"

Luna: "Yes, mother." *She grunted on her breath and turned around with watering eyes, walking up to the shower.*

?????: "Are you sure-?"

Luna: *She twisted the taps, turning the shower on.* "Yes, Kairi." *She grunted in an annoyed-like manner, stepping into the shower.*

Kairi: "Okay. Let me know if you need anything."

Luna: "Wateva." *She lowered her head under the water, hiding her tears.*

----------

Rachael: *She observed the paintball field from the roof, watching Lance being surrounded by five players holding shooters.* (Lance has a sword with paint, while the other team members have shooters-)

Player: "Let's get him-" *He smirked in a smug-like manner and pulled the trigger, causing the other members to shoot at Lance.*

Lance: *He swayed to the side, closely avoiding the first barrage of paintballs.* "Aha, pathetic, aye-"

Player: "Shut up!" *He squinted one eye, shooting black paintballs at Lance's head.*

Lance: *He sliced the sword around him, causing strings of black paint to splash away from him.* (This is for Ash!)

Rachael: *She watched Lance skilfully avoid the continuous barrage of paintballs, while slashing each player.* (Wow-) "Out... Out... You're out." *Her voice echoed and sounded static, due to the poor speakers inside.*

*The players on the bench in the waiting area all looked up and stared at the next announcement.*

Rachael: "The game is now over! Everyone to the waiting area and the winner will be announced." *She walked down metal stairs from the roof, closely followed by the staff.*

Staff Member A: "Have you seen a guy move like that before?"

Staff Member B: "No, he was obviously determined, huh?"

Staff Member A: "Sure was. I wonder who over?"

Rachael: "Thank you all for playing." *She spoke to the players inside the warehouse and looked outside, watching the remaining players walk in.* "They're coming now."

Ashton: *He waited on the bench with the other players, mumbling to himself in thought.* (I wonder how Lance went?)

Rachael: (How did he do that?) *She thought to herself in shock.*

*Five players walked in with black slash marks all over their shirts.*

Ashton: *He closely observed the smear marks on the player's shirts.* (Was that from Lance?)

*The players on the bench started to chatter amongst themselves until Lance trotted in.*

Lance: (Too easy-) *The players noticed no trace of paint on his shirt, causing them to gasp in disbelief.*

*One of the five players took his shirt off in anger and threw it on the ground.* "It was five against one and we all had shooters." *He looked at the four players.* "You're all pathetic." *He stormed out of the warehouse.*

Lance: (Pathetic alright.) *He chuckled to himself, as he walked over to Ashton.* "Let's go, I'm gonna head home 'n' get changed."

Ashton: "Okay, let me quickly talk to Rach for a sec."

Lance: "Wateva." *He rolled his eyes and took off the shirt.*

Ashton: *He slowly walked up to Rachael, as she bent over a table and shuffled papers.* "Hey."

Rachael: "Oh, hey." *She faced him and blushed.*

Ashton: "I know Lance somehow won, but he-"

Rachael: "He's bored and wants to go home?"

*They smiled and awkwardly giggled.*

Ashton: "Well, I better go-"

Rachael: "Bye." *Her face became redder.*

*Ashton and Lance casually left the warehouse, covering their faces due to the sunlight which shined in their eyes.*

Ashton: "So, how did you do it?" *His car lights flashed, as he unlocked the car.*

Lance: "Do wat?"

Ashton: *He opened the door and placed his hands on the steering wheel.* "How you were able to take them all out?"

Lance: "I dunno, it's just a game."

Ashton: "They all teamed up against you."

Lance: "I know." *He spoke on his breath as if he didn't care.*

Ashton: (Lance being Lance.) *He sighed and started to drive towards Lance's house.*

----------

Cortax: "What are you doing here? We aren't due for tax for another three weeks."

Kath: "Actually, we're not here for tax." *She smirked in an evil-like manner, listening to the trees move in the cool night's breeze.*

Ridley: "Do you think a Consultant would bother themselves over something so petty?"

Victoria: "Then why?"

Ridley: *He looked at Kath and waved his hand around Cortax, as if he was implying something.* "Would you like to go first?"

Kath: "Indeed." *She stepped forward, drawing all attention towards her.* "This visit is about your abilities."

Victoria: "Our abilities?"

Kath: "The way you channel Neurons and Astragons, we know this can also be done through Radiatons."

Cortax: "Radiatons?" *He spoke in confusion, slowly shaking his head.*

Ridley: "Don't take us for fools."

Cortax: "How do you know about Radiatons?!"

Ridley: "Hmm? I don't know much about my colleague's past, but, shouldn't you recognise her? This is The Ruins of Estel, right?"

Kath: "No need to press on any further. It would be very unprofessional to bring up the past." *She smirked and pushed her glasses up with one finger.*

Cortax: "What about the Radiatons?"

Ridley: "You see. Your powers are something to be feared-"

Victoria: "Feared?"

Kath: "Do you honestly not know the power you wield, or do you seriously take us for fools?"

Ridley: "This entire city has the potential to ruin our plans-"

Kath: "Therefore, we must eradicate the problem."

Cassandra: (Eradicate?)

Cortax: "Problem? We've had no intentions of causing you problems!"

Ridley: "If you're struggling with a question, take out the problem, and the answer becomes quite clear."

Victoria: "What are you saying?"

Ridley: "The folly, can't you understand yet?"

Kath: "This is no longer discussable."

Cortax: "You haven't told us anything! We can't read your mind!"

Ridley: "Maybe you can? Your powers may be unethical to Remenistal Users or Elementalists, but your potential is unimaginable."

Victoria: "So, we're a threat?"

Ridley: "Ahh, not as half-witted as I originally thought."

Cortax: (If they plan to attack, a fight of such magnitude could destroy this entire city!)

Kath: "Unless you have furthermore questions, actions speak louder than words." *She formed fists, causing her hands to burst into flames.*

Victoria: *She gasped and stepped back, quickly hiding her intimidation.* (Her Neurons! She just released her Neurons and I've never felt something so powerful in all my-)

Ridley: "Shall we dance?" *He chuckled in a condescending manner and focused with squinted eyes, causing swirls of shadow-like darkness to envelop his hands.*

Cortax: (My worst fear!-) "Everyone!" *He shouted, queuing everyone to start dancing.*

----------

*Luna anxiously waited on a long silver bench in the middle of the park and looked up, staring at the stars.*

Luna: *She exhaled nervously and wrapped her arms around her stomach.* (Every person who seemed to care for me turned out to be false..-)

Carlo: "'Sup?" *He smirked, slowly walking up to the bench.*

Luna: "Carlo-" *She smirked and quickly stood up, causing Carlo to chuckle.*

Carlo: "So."

Luna: "So.."

Carlo: *He noticed Luna's ball-like dress, causing him to smirk in an impressed-like manner.* "About the ball-"

Luna: "We should go-"

Carlo: "Well, maybe I was thinking we could skip that."

Luna: "Skip?"

Carlo: "Well, yeah."

Luna: "Why?" *She spoke in confusion.*

Carlo: "Well, you're good looking."

Luna: "Wait, wat?"

Carlo: "Yea, I was wondering if we could, ya know."

Luna: "Ya know? Ya know wat?"

Carlo: *He grabbed Luna's waist and smirked, slowly stepping forward.* "Fun?"

Luna: "Didn't you want to go to the ball?"

Carlo: "We can have fun other ways?"

Luna: "I-I've liked you for ages-"

Carlo: "Cool, so, where do you wanna go?"

Luna: *She shook her head, instantly looking sad.* "I'm goin' home-"

Carlo: "Huh?"

Luna: "This is what you wanted the whole time, right?"

Carlo: "Yea? Aren't you into that stuff?"

Luna: "I've never-" *She spoke with quivering lips and pushed Carlo back, instantly running away.*

Carlo: "Fine-" *He frowned in disgust, as if Luna was in the wrong.*

Luna: (I knew it.. I knew it!)

Carlo: "That stupid slag." *He sighed on his breath, as if he no longer had any plans.*

Luna: (I hate...) *She ran with a tensed up body and scrunched her eyes shut, causing tears to run down her cheeks.*

*Luna ran across the street and straight towards her house, angrily opening the fly screen.*

Luna: (Why can't I find anyone?!) *She stumbled into the house, catching Kairi's attention.*

Kairi: "Hun-?"

Luna: "Gah!-" *She screamed with emotion and started to violently rip off the dress' accessories.*

Kairi: "What's wrong-?"

Luna: "Nothin'! Just stop!" *She sniffed, storming into her room.*

Kairi: "..." *She awkwardly smiled to herself, before focusing her attention back into the kitchen.*

Luna: *She sobbed, dropping to her knees.* (I can't believe this...)

*Luna fell to her side and stared at the wall with an emotionless face, ignoring the tears which streamed across her face.*

----------

*Lance's room was as messy as a teenager's. There were clothes scattered on the floor and cables tangled from his electronics. He had stacks of DVD's and games. He also had a wooden table with all sorts of crystals and piles of spiritual magazines. The room was dimly lit.*

Lance: *He sighed and sat on the end of his bed.* (There's nothing to do.) *He looked around with a bored expression and his stomach growled.*

*An hourly alarm beeped, causing Lance to moan with boredom.*

Lance: *The bed squeaked as he leant up and walked to the living room.* (I shouldn't have come home so early-) *He jumped on the couch and changed the channel on the TV.*

Anchor Man: "And now Mrs. Hambridge will be giving us an update on Sceldrant's Comet."

Mrs. Hambridge: "Thank you. Now that Sceldrant's comet is closer to Earth we're able to grasp more information from it, we have also gathered the most intelligent meteorologists and have found some interesting findings relating to the comet."

Lance: "Not the news again."

Mrs. Hambridge: "Firstly, I have been receiving emails asking the same question and well let me tell you all, that there is no chance of the comet actually hitting us. Next, we believe the comet may cause some disturbances in the weather as the comet emits an abnormal energy signature our computers can't register."

Kairi: *She made noises in the kitchen, as she took the roast out of the oven.* (Almost ready-)

Mrs. Hambridge: "We also have pinpointed that the comet will be viewable around ten 'o clock at night, local time."

Lance: (At ten, aye?)

Mrs. Hambridge: "Once again, you'll be able to see all of the comet's glory if you pop down to the local library or public schools, as we're allowing people to freely use the telescopes!"

Anchor Man: "Thank you Mrs. Hambridge, we will continue the interview after a short message."

*A mysterious advert caused the screen to glow aurora colours, catching Lance's attention.*

Kairi: "Din-Din's ready, hun." *She sliced the roast onto three separate plates.*

Lance: "Shh this kool show is on!! I'll be there in a second!"

Kairi: "Okay, please make haste before it gets cold." *She walked over to the table and placed the dishes in their respective places.*

TV Advert: *The advert showed pictures of products and a map on how to get there. It played on a continual loop with a voice over.* "Don't miss our one-day-opening! Spirit attachments, curses, unwelcome guests, we specialise in all that stuff. We will be opening at eleven in the morning to one in the afternoon. If you're into this type of stuff, this is a must see!"

Lance: *He sat on the edge of the couch due to excitement.* (I really want to go, but Ashton's stupid manager thing is on tomorrow-)

Kairi: *She noticed Lance stare at a blank screen, which caused her to look curious.* "Lance?"

Lance: *He unintentionally ignored her, as he grumbled deep in thought.* (I always feel like I can sense strange things and all that stuff so, I want to check this out. I don't even want to be a manager, I'm only doing it for Ashton.) *He sighed to himself with frustration.*

Kairi: "What was all that about, hun?"

Lance: "Some stupid thing." (Sorry Ashton but I really want to go to this store.)

Kairi: "Lance, it's getting cold." *She sat down and grabbed a knife and fork.*

Lance: "I'm comin' far out." *He got up and hobbled to the table as he plopped himself onto a chair.*

Kairi: "Luna, come on! It's getting cold!" *Her voice caused the sounds of a door opening in response.*

Luna: "Sorry, mother." *She walked out of her room dressed in all black and covered in dark make-up.*

Lance: (That thing is my sister-) *He watched Luna drag her feet to the table.*

Luna: *She noticed Lance staring at her, which caused her eyebrow to twitch.* "Wat are you lookin' at?!"

Lance: "Did ya take so long 'cause you were cuttin' yourself a little longer than usual?"

Luna: "So, Lance, have you seen any more ghosts lately or tryin' to summon a character from one of your stupid games?" *She smirked.*

Lance: "Wow, was I wrong? You took so long because you had to glue your face together because it broke when you tried to smile?"

Kairi: "Lance, enough!"

Lance: "What about her?" *He pointed at Luna like a child.*

Kairi: "She is five years younger than you, you should know better-"

Lance: "Yeah thanks for dinner, I'm off to bed, aye." *He pushed the chair back and made his way to his room.*

Kairi: "But you haven't eaten anything?" *Her voice slightly echoed down the hallway.*

Lance: "I'm not hungry anymore." *He slammed the door behind him and took a few steps into his room and yawned.* (Looks like I used more energy at that paintball thing than I expected.) *He yawned again and lay down on the bed. He fell asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow.*

----------

Luna: *She frowned in anger, intensely staring at herself in the mirror.* (That stupid idiot!)

*Luna rubbed her left eye and dropped her arm in a defeated-like manner, smearing black makeup all down one side of her face.*

Luna: (Maybe I'll join Kylie and Kerry-Anne tomorrow, not like anyone will care..) *She whimpered and dragged her feet to the bed, collapsing face-first into the pillow.*

----------

*Nathan slowly woke up, noticing he was bound by thick rusty chains.*

Nathan: "Huh-?" *He glanced across a jail-like cell, listening to the sounds of chains and moans echo in the background.*

*Nathan squinted and opened his eyes wider, finding himself chained to a stone door.*

Nathan: (I've... I've finally been captured?)

----------

*Ashton and Rachael stood on the roof of Fast Food Enterprise, watching the cars drive down the street.*

Rachael: "It wasn't cool what Lance did."

Ashton: "He did a no show on the day he was meant to do his manager's induction."

Rachael: "How did Twortz react?"

Ashton: *She wasn't too impressed, but I was able to cover for him."

Rachael: (Ash is so sweet.) *She looked at Ashton with blushing cheeks.*

Ashton: "Thanks for today." *He smiled and held Rachael's hand, causing her to giggle.*

Rachael: "Why're you thanking me? We just talked after your shift-"

Ashton: "No matter what we're doing, I'm always grateful for the times we spend together."

Rachael: "Hehe, Ash."

Ashton: "No. I mean it, Rach."

Rachael: (I can see why a lot of girls are jealous of me now, he's a wonder-)

Ashton: *He looked up and watched the stars flicker, causing him to smile.* (I find the good in everyone, but with Rach, I don't even need to try. She is just amazing-) "Excuse me, Rach?"

Rachael: *She looked up, admiring the stars with Ashton.* "Yeah?"

Ashton: "How come you never complain or ask why I'm Lance's friend?"

Rachael: "Why should I question who you should be friends with?"

Ashton: "Ha ha, that's what I like about you." *He smiled and shook his head, as if it didn't matter.*

Rachael: "Oh? So you only like me because I don't question anything about you?" *She spoke in a playful-like manner, looking at Ashton with a smile.*

Ashton: "Ha ha, you got me." *He stepped back and swayed his arms, as if Rachael was right.*

Rachael: "Hehe, sure did, arsehole." *She smirked and playfully turned away, folding her arms.*

Ashton: "You're amazing, Rach."

Rachael: "That's Rachael to you."

Ashton: "Oh, sorry. Ahem. You're amazing, unacceptable face."

Rachael: "Hehe! Unacceptable face?" *She turned around and faced Ashton, trying not to laugh.*

Ashton: "Ha ha, that's the best I got. Leave me alone."

Rachael: "You halfwit." *She smirked, causing Ashton to turn red.*

Ashton: "All you do is pay me out, jeez. Give me a break."

Rachael: *She smirked, stepping forward.* "Sorry?"

Ashton: "Acceptable." *He smirked and leant forward, kissing Rachael on the lips.*

----------

*Luna, Kylie and Kerry-Anne drank from alcohol bottles, watching the sunrise.*

Kylie: "This feels like a public holiday."

Kerry-Anne: "Sceldrant's Comet.. It kinda is."

Luna: "Yea." *She grunted in agreement and violently rocked the bottle up, taking a sip of alcohol.*

Kylie: "We've all been hurt, so why do we seriously continue to rot?"

Kerry-Anne: "Wither and waste our parents' money?"

Luna: (Wasting our parents' money? She's right! I never thought of it like that-)

Kylie: "It would be easier to end it.."

Kerry-Anne: "Damn right." *She spoke in a sorrowful-like manner, taking a sip from the bottle.*

Luna: "Such a waste of space and resources, aye."

Kerry-Anne and Kylie: "Damn right."

----------

*Lance stood outside Fast Food Enterprise and sighed, before opening the door.*

Lance: *He stepped inside and instantly felt cool air brush past him.* (That's better.) *He noticed Ashton standing with his arms folded and his face filled with disappointment.* (He doesn't look happy-)

Ashton: "Lance! I will not accept this." *He stormed across the dining room and up to Lance.* "I was made to look like a fool in front of Tyler and Twortz."

Lance: "Why does it matter?" *He spoke as if he didn't care.*
 
Ashton: "It matters because I'm the one who suggested promoting you. I really don't know why you are my best friend sometimes!"

Lance: *He picked up several napkins to wipe the sweat off his face.* "So wat, I ain't gonna get promoted?"

Ashton: *He sighed and looked away.* "Lance-"

Lance: "Well?"

Ashton: "Well luckily for you Twortz said, since you are our best worker Ashton, I will let this no show slide. If he wants this position to let him know that myself and a few other employees will be here tonight. We will begin the assessment then."

Lance: "OK-"

Ashton: "You are so lucky."

Lance: "I'm sorry, Ashton."

Ashton: "One of these days I won't forgive you.. What flaming fudge were you doing anyway? I was calling non-stop?"

Lance: "Ah, I, umm? Overslept. I'm sorry, man.... And thanks for sticking up for me." *He threw the napkins in the bin.*

Ashton: *He sighed and adjusted his belt.* "If you don't turn up tonight I won't forgive you." *His voice was stern and his face filled with seriousness.*

Lance: "Yea, I will."

Ashton: "Well I have rosters to do so I'll be on the computer all day. Come back at around nine thirty?"

Lance: "Yea kool, I'll see you then."

*Ashton nodded his head and quietly walked back behind the counter to the office. Lance turned around and walked to the door.*

Lance: (Oh no-) *He stopped and sighed, realising he had to walk all the way back to his house in the heat. He opened the door and hot air engulfed him.*

Tyler: *He eavesdropped on Lance and Ashton's conversation, as he spied through a display cabinet.* (Why is Lance Ashton's best friend?)

Lance: (I suppose this is karma.) *He sighed and braced himself, as he took a few steps outside.*

Tyler: (He always hinders Ashton's performance....)

----------

*A man and woman in dancer-like garments ran through an ancient forest with their arms swaying behind their back.*

?????: *She looked at the darkly tanned man, frowning in a worried-like manner.* "I'm worried, Lehi."

Lehi: *He looked at the woman with red hair, shaking his head.* "We have to get to the city before they do."

?????: "But-"

Lehi: "Don't worry, Elizabeth. Victoria, Cortax and the others will be there."

Elizabeth: "But, Holy Neurons, the Consultant!-"

Lehi: "We'll worry about that when we get there."

Elizabeth: "Okay." *She frowned in determination and started to run faster, causing her robes to rapidly flap to each side.*

----------

Luna: *She sat on the end of her bed, listening to the crickets sing in the night's breeze.* (I can't believe I passed out and slept for the entire day!)

*Luna moaned and looked up, watching Lance step into the bathroom.*

Luna: *She looked down and held her head up, listening to the shower turn on.* (I even left my door open? Gah.. I can't believe-)

*Lights suddenly spiralled out of the bathroom, instantly catching Luna's attention.*

Luna: "W-Wat the-?!" *She unintentionally screamed in shock, intensely staring at the swirling lights.*

Kairi: *She power walked down the hallway and looked at Luna, catching her attention.* "Hun?"

Luna: "Th-There's lights!" *She pointed behind Kairi, causing her to turn around.*

Kairi: *She stared at the bathroom door with an unimpressed expression on her face.* "There's nothing-"

Luna: "I-I saw lights!" *She rubbed her eyes, ignoring the smeared black make-up on her face.*

Kairi: *She took several steps into Luna's room, instantly sniffing the air.* (Alcohol...) "Let's go to the couch."

Luna: "But-"

Kairi: (Why does she do this to herself?) *She grabbed Luna by the arm and gently lifted her up.*

Luna: "But-? Gah!" *She frowned in pain.* (My head-)

Kairi: *She walked down the hallway and gently placed Luna on the couch.* "There-"

Luna: "No! Just check the effin' bathroom!"

Kairi: *She sighed in a defeated-like manner and turned around, walking towards the bathroom.* "Lance?"

Luna: *She awkwardly looked over the couch, staring at Kairi with anticipation.* "What if there're aliens-"

Kairi: *She knocked on the door, ignoring Luna's suggestion.* "Are you okay in there, hun?"

Lance: "Wateva, go away." *He shouted with an echoing voice, stepping into the shower.*

Kairi: "Okay."

Luna: *She shook her head, watching Kairi walk back towards her.* "I'm freakin' serious, all these lights spiralled out of the door."

Kairi: "Shh, it's okay." *She walked up to Luna and hugged her.*

Luna: "It's not OK. I know what I saw."

Kairi: ".. Are you taking drugs again?"

Luna: "Drugs? What? No."

Kairi: "Maybe Lance played a trick on you?"

Luna: "My stupid brother doesn't have the intelligence to play a trick like that."

--

*Lance stood in the fogged up bathroom and listened to the cheers outside, which filled him up with excitement.*

Lance: *He chuckled and shook his head.* (Stupid crazy old fart.) *As he changed, he gazed upon faded crystal-like purple stone with a guilty face.* (I will show Ashton the cool crystal.. I will tell him the truth about the no show.)

*Lance opened the door and walked down the hallway, catching Kairi's attention.*

Kairi: "Where are you going?" *She spoke in a curious tone.*

Lance: "I'm off to work." *He walked past her, blatantly ignoring Luna.*

Kairi: "I thought it was your day off?"

*Lance ignored her and slammed the front door, as he jogged his way to work.*

Luna: "It came from the bathroom.." *She grunted on her breath and started to watch TV.*

Kairi: *She looked at Luna and sighed, causing her to slowly walk into the bathroom.* (Huh?)

*Kairi stared at the fogged up mirror, noticing glyphic-like hieroglyphs on them.*

Kairi: (He is twenty-one and he still writes on the mirror?) *She sighed again and reached for a cloth.*

*Firework-like rumbles echoed outside, followed by cheers of excitement.*

Luna: *She frowned, tapping the remote on the side of her head.* (They're too noisy.)

Kairi: *She switched on the bathroom's fan and started to wipe off the glyphs on the fogged up mirror.* (Wait a minute.. These glyphs!?!) *She gasped and stepped back.*

Luna: *She heard Kairi gasp, causing her to mute the TV.* "Wat's wrong?"

Kairi: "I-I need you to get Lance now!"

Luna: *She frowned in a rebellious-like manner, as if she didn't want to.* "Excuse-?!"

Kairi: "Go, now!" *She shouted out of character, causing Luna to slowly stand up in shock.*

Luna: "O-OK?" *She spoke as if she didn't know what to do.*

Kairi: "He's headed for work, go!"

Luna: "Umm, OK..?"

----------

*Excitement filled the atmosphere, as if it was a holiday at Dee Highs.*

Lance: *He looked up and squinted his eyes, staring at the night sky.* (No signs of that damned comet yet.)

*There were posters, bulletins, newsstands, radio adverts, mostly all media outlets, advertising the arrival of Sceldrant's Comet.*

Lance: *He walked past a group of kids holding glow sticks and shirts with the words 'Sceldrant's Comet' on them.* (The store's closed a little early tonight-)

Guy: "Yeah! I'm Sceldrant's Comet!" *He spun in circles pretending to be a plane.*

Lance: *He let himself into the store through the back door and walked into the break room to find everyone in multiple conversations.* "Wow, everyone's lookin' all fancy, it feels like we're going out or somethin'."

Tyler: *He turned around and stared at Lance in disgust.* "You're so immature, Lance."

Lance: "You're like, so immature, Lance." *He pretended to be an idiot, mimicking Tyler in a condescending-like manner.*

Tyler: *He rolled his eyes and scratched several pimples on his face.* "Idiots say what."

Lance: "Wat did you say, your highness?!" *Sweat dripped off his face and on to the floor.*

Tyler: "Eww, is that what someone looks like if they don't have their driver's licence?" *He raised his nose and stormed out of the room.*

Lance: "I need to find the right drivin' school!" *He yelled out, as he watched Tyler walk away.*

Rachael: *She snickered.* "So anyway, how have you been, Lance?" *She walked up to him.* "I haven't worked with you in ages."

Lance: "I'm off the floor, gettin' trained up to be your boss." *He poked out his tongue.*

Rachael: *She rolled her eyes and silently left the room.* (I don't know what Ashton sees in that fool.) *She grunted, as she climbed up a ladder to the roof.*

Twortz: *She left the manager's office and walked past the break room, noticing Lance.* "Oh, Lance!" *She sounded surprised.* "Too bad you weren't able to make it today."

Lance: "O-Oh hello, yea.." *He nervously chuckled and looked to each side.*

*Melinda slid down the ladder and rushed into the room.*

Twortz: *She faced Melinda with urgency.* "What's the rush, Melinda?"

Melinda: "Come quick, guys! Mum said it will happen in ten minutes!" *She jumped up and down on the spot in excitement.*

Twortz: "Ten minutes?" *She sounded excited, while keeping a professional-like expression.*

Melinda: "I will see you both up there." *She turned off her phone and ran out of their sight.*

Twortz: "We'll begin the management induction once all this comes to pass, understood?"

Lance: "Yea, sure thing, Twotters."

Twortz: "What?"

Lance: "I said, we need new lockers."

Twortz: "Let's go." *She coughed and faced the ladder.*

Lance: "Yea!" *He rudely power walked in front of Twortz and climbed up the ladder first.*

Twortz: *She climbed the ladder in thought.* (With this comet, it's going to be very busy tomorrow.)

----------

Luna: *She knocked on an expensive looking door, while talking on a mobile phone.* "Oi, Kerry, meet me at Fast Food Enterprise."

Kerry-Anne: "Why?!"

Luna: "Just do it, I think the mother finally PMS'd herself."

Keryy-Anne: "Blahahaha! Rightio, I'll see you there-"

Kylie: *She opened the door and instantly noticed Luna.* "Oi?"

Luna: "Upto?"

Kylie: "Bored.." *She revealed cuts on her arms, causing Luna to nod her head in understanding.*

Luna: "Wanna come with?"

Kylie: "Where?"

Luna: "Fast Food Enterprise?"

Kylie: *She shrugged her shoulders, as if she didn't care.* "Watevs, not like anyone's home anyway."

Luna: "Kerry will be meeting us there."

Kylie: "I'm always up for an excuse to stay out all night." *She smirked and grabbed a coat from behind the door, allowing her to hide her freshly cut marks.*

Luna: "Aha, know me too well, aye."

Kylie: "Dunno 'bout you, but I got a hangover."

Luna: "Shame!"

Kylie: "You?"

Luna: "I passed out all day."

Kylie: "Blahahah." *She chuckled and closed the door behind her, slowly walking down the noisy street.*

----------

*Rachael, Tyler and Ashton stood outside on the roof admiring the lively scenery around them.*

Tyler: "W-Wow.." *He squealed on his breath and observed a nearby park, scratching a large oily pimple on his face.*

Ashton: *He smiled at Rachael, causing her to uncontrollably giggle.* "What's so funny?"

Rachael: "I was wondering.." *She spoke in a nervous-like manner, causing Ashton to pay more attention.*

Ashton: "Rach?"

Rachael: "Well. When my dad gets back to Dee Highs, I was wondering.." *She paused, as if she didn't know what to say.*

Ashton: "Haha, Rach? Not having confidence is completely unlike you."

Rachael: "Hehe.." *She giggled, taking a deep breath.* "Well, would you like to come with us on a next business meeting?"

Ashton: "Business meeting? One of your dads?"

Rachael: "Yeah. He usually goes overseas."

Ashton: "Isn't he gone for months?"

Rachael: "Well, don't you have years of annual leave?"

Ashton: "Haha, I wouldn't say years."

Rachael: "You've never taken a sick day, or holiday."

Ashton: *He smiled and observed Rachael's facial expression.* (She must've put a lot of thought into this proposal.)

Rachael: "Well, what do you say?" *She looked up and stared at Ashton, slightly avoiding direct eye contact as if she was worried what his answer could be.*

Ashton: "Of course, I will."

Rachael: "A-Awesome." *She gasped with a widening smile.*

?????: "Almost there says mum!" *She shouted in excitement, jumping onto the roof.*

Rachael: "Melinda?"

Melinda: "Mum says, you should be able to see the comet soon!"

Rachael: "R-Really?!" *She gasped in amazement and skipped towards a telescope, which was hidden in the night's darkness.*

Ashton: *He smiled at Rachael and opened a book, giving the illusion he was reading.* (Wow.. Spend a few months with Rachael.. I can't wait to tell Lance-)

Lance: *He popped his head up and noticed Rachael looking through a telescope at the sky.* (Wow, the sky-) *He thought in a condescending tone, watching Melinda gloat about her mother to Rachael.* (Who cares-) *He noticed Ashton reading a book, as he waited for the comet.* "Oi."

Ashton: "Good grief, it's Lance and Twortz!" *He put the book down, quickly helping Lance and Twortz up from the ladder.*

Twortz: "Ah, thank you, Ashton."

Ashton: *He smiled, watching Twortz brush dirt off her hands.* "Anytime."

Lance: *He took off his backpack, holding it in one hand.* "Well, I'm here."

Ashton: "Thank you for coming, Lance."

Lance: "Yea, it was nothin', aye." *He walked over to the ledge of the roof and unzipped the backpack, revealing a carton of eggs.* (Aha, you little shits are going to get it-)

*Ashton nudged Lance, knocking the carton and eggs onto the ground.*

Lance: "But-" *He looked down to his feet and stared at the cracked eggs with disappointment.*

Ashton: "Unacceptable!"

Lance: (Well there goes the fun.) *As he zipped up the bag, the stone shined in his face.* (Oh, the crystal-) "Hey, Ash."

Ashton: "What is it?" *He walked over to Lance.*

Lance: "Well-" *He paused, nervously sighing to himself.*

Melinda: "Oh my gosh!-" *She spoke on her breath, staring at the sky in disbelief.*

Lance: "Wat I really did today was-" *He was interrupted by loud screams and yells in the background.*

Melinda: "Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh! You can see it in the far distance!"

*Rachael and Melinda jumped up holding each other's hands in excitement.*

Tyler: *He stared at the comet with his mouth open in amazement.* "..."

Ashton: "Tell me after this, yeah?" *He gazed upon the red dot, as he walked up to Melinda.* "Excuse me? Do you mind if I take a look?"

Lance: "Wateva." *He mumbled and folded his arms like a child.*

Melinda: "Go ahead, that's why I brought it hehe."

Ashton: *He closed one eye and looked through the telescope.* (Wow, I've never seen flames swirl like that.)

Rachael: "Could I take a look please?"

Ashton: "Sure-" *He smiled and stepped to the side.*

Rachael: "Hehe, thanks." *She smirked and leant forward into the telescope.* "It's so pretty."

Twortz: "Hmm?" *She looked up at the sky and stared at the dot.* "What's so special about a comet?"

Rachael: "Take a look and see for yourself." *She moved her hands and presented the telescope to Twortz.*

Twortz: "Okay, if you insist." *She stepped forward and looked through the telescope.*

Melinda: "Well?"

Ashton: "The fire is amazing, you agree with me?"

Twortz: "The comet looks like it has markings on it, like pictures or drawings." *Her constant bored face changed into astonishment.*

Rachael: "Pictures?"

Melinda: "Drawings?"

Twortz: "Do you hear that violin?"

Ashton: "I don't hear anything?"

Lance: (Sceldrant's Comet.) *He stepped forward and stared at the red dot in a trance-like state.* (I feel something from it.)

Ashton: *He quickly glanced around and smiled.* (The area was filled with constant chatter and yelling, and now it's completely silent-)

*The atmosphere started to bend and warp due to the comet's presence.*

Twortz: "The colours are dancing in the night sky." *She looked astonished, as she spoke out of character.*

Melinda: "Wow, it is amazing." (No wonder why my mother never shuts up about it.)

*The party focused all their attention to the swirls of aurora lights, they failed to notice the flickering light in Lance's backpack.*

----------

Cortax: "You don't have to do this!" *He shouted, noticing the area light up around Kath's hands.*

Victoria: *A purple sigil-like glyph drew itself on the ground around her.* (Lehi and Elizabeth are taking ages.. But they should almost be here. I can sense them.)

Cortax: (My love, make haste-)

Kath: "We will deal with the masters, you and number two will strike down the others." *She spoke in a stern, professional-like manner, catching Cassandra's attention.*

Cassandra: "Ma'am?"

Ridley: "This will be exciting." *He smirked in a condescending-like manner, watching glyphs form under the dancer's feet.*

Kath: "Understood, number two and nine?"

Cassandra: (Number two-?)

*A woman flashstepped in front of Cassandra, causing a swirl of dirt to blow around her.*

Cassandra: *She stared at the woman's platinum armour in shock.* (Number two! Nancy, the feeder.)

Nancy: "Understood, ma'am, sir!"

Ridley: "Ha ha, such professionalism!"

Nancy: "Cassandra-" *Two small green dragons suddenly materialised on each side, causing her to smirk with growing confidence.* "Let's slaughter them."

Dancer: "As if!" *He shouted with an echoing voice and danced to the side, causing a spiral of air to swirl towards Nancy.*

Cassandra: "Number two!" *She flashstepped next to Nancy and swayed the sword to the side, visibly slicing the spiral of air in two.*

Dancer: *He watched the wind blow Cassandra and Nancy's hair to one side.* (She sliced my air current!)

Woman: "I got this!" *She hopped on each leg, causing sigil-like glyphs to spiral around her.* "AIR SWIRL-"

Nancy: "Dinner's ready." *Her words queued the dragons to flashstep on each side of the woman, causing Cassandra to gasp.*

Cassandra: (Her Scoldrants can flashstep?!)

Woman: "No!-" *She screamed, as the dragons bit her body in two.*

Dancer: "No!" *He shouted in terror, watching the blood splatter around the dragon's mouths.*

Nancy: "Leaving me all the work? How will you earn experience?"

Cassandra: "Tssk." *She gritted her teeth and stood in a battle-ready pose.* "Ougi."

Nancy: "Ougi?" *She smirked in a curious-like manner, looking over her shoulder to Cassandra.*

Cassandra: "Dragon's Gate."

Nancy: "Dragon's Gate?" (That's said to be the strongest sword art!-)

Dancer: *He bent his knees and started to dance from side to side.* "I don't care what you use, you're in our city!" *He shouted with an echoing voice, watching a red glyph form underneath him.*

Nancy: *She smirked, watching all the dancers focus their attention to Cassandra.* (Protect her.)

*The dragons responded to Nancy's thoughts, causing them to flashstep around Cassandra.*

Cassandra: *She looked at the dragon's, looking slightly intimidated.* "Uh?"

Nancy: "You've paused your Neurons. Continue the attack, they will not harm you."

Cassandra: *She took a deep breath and lowered the sword, causing the air to warp around it.* "The strongest sword art."

Dancer: (Those Neurons!-)

Cassandra: "Harh!" *She jabbed the sword towards the ground, causing an eruption of fluoro red, dragon-like heads to wave from the sword's tip.*

Nancy: (Excellent-)

Cassandra: "I'm sorry..."

Dancer: "Everyone, use your strongest Remenistal! FLAME BOLT" *He shouted to the dancers and pushed forward, shooting four fireballs at the fluoro dragon-like heads.*

Nancy: (Do you really think Remenistal of that level would stop that Ougi?)

Dancer: *He watched the fireballs explode on the wave of dragon heads, causing him to gasp with widening eyes.* (It did nothing!-)

Nancy: *She watched shards of ice, rock, wind and fire hit into Cassandra's attack, causing her to chuckle in an envious-like manner.* (Even I'm jealous of such a powerful technique, bwohohoho.)

Cortax: *He listened to the dancer's screams, causing him to step forward.* "That technique is killing-"

Ridley: *He stepped in the same direction as Cortax, catching his attention.* "If you step in, so will we."

Cortax: *He frowned at Ridley.* (Damn the Astragons!)

Nancy: *One of the dragons growled, causing her to smirk.* "Looks like two survived."

Cassandra: *She took deep breaths, trying to contain her exhaustion.* "Survived my Ougi?" *She spoke in disbelief, focusing her attention on the growing dirt cloud.*

Nancy: "Just do it again."

Cassandra: *She nodded her head and stood in a battle-ready pose, causing the air to warp around her sword.* "Ougi, Dragon's Gate."

Nancy: (Unless the Consultants demand our help, we will ensure no pawns get in the way-)

Cassandra: "Hah!" *She jabbed the tip of the sword into the ground, causing a wave of fluoro dragon-like heads to wave towards the dirt cloud.*

?????: "Ougi." *A woman hummed on a soft high note and a pulse of silver wind blew from her mouth.*

Kath: "It would seem the other masters are here, Ridley."

Ridley: "Oh dear-"

Victoria: (That Ougi, it's Elizabeth!-)

Nancy: *She squinted her eyes, noticing silver wind blow inside the dirt cloud.* (What kind of Ougi produces silver wind-?)

?????: "Angelic Celestic Siren."

Cassandra: "Huh-?" *Her eyes suddenly glowed silver, causing her to awkwardly sway her entire body.*

Nancy: "What are you-?!" *She watched the wave of red dragon-like heads, rumble towards her.*

Nancy: *Her eyes suddenly glowed silver and she jumped out of the way, quickly spinning around.* "Ougi, I summon the maelstrom of death!-"

*Nancy crossed her arms, causing a massive aurora coloured pearl to materialise in front of her.*

Ridley: "How sneaky.." *He spoke on his breath, watching the wave of dragon heads rumble towards Kath.*

Kath: "Direct manipulation? Interesting-" *She casually spun around and slapped the wave of dragon heads with her bare hand, causing it to crash to the side.*

Ridley: *He felt the ground rumble, as the dragon heads faded into nothing.* (Superb.)

Cassandra: (Sh-She slapped my Ougi away?!) *She squirmed and gritted her teeth, as if she couldn't control her body.*

Kath: "Rather weak for a captain levelled warrior."

Ridley: "I concur."

Kath: "Although-" *She glanced at Nancy, listening to thunder rumble in the sky.* "Nancy's Poly Zap is a powerful passive summon. It could hinder our plan."

Ridley: "No need to say anymore." *He smirked and stepped to the side, pushing his hand in the captain's general direction.*

Elizabeth: *The dirt cloud settled, revealing Lehi and Elizabeth standing in the courtyard, staring at the bodies in disgust.*

Lehi: "Our.. City?"

Ridley: "With my power open the dark gates, silently gather and consume the hate, MANIPULATE, DARK STATE"

Nancy: *Yellow, red and blue glyphic rings spiralled around the pearl, queuing her to raise her arms.* "Poly Zap-"

Ridley: "The folly." *He smirked and flicked his wrist up, causing a wave of darkness to erupt out of the ground, slamming into Nancy and Cassandra's stomach.*

Elizabeth: *She gagged, causing her eyes to revert back into their blue colour.* "H-He.."

Lehi: "You alright? Your Astragons distorted for a moment."

Elizabeth: "I usually deactivate my Ougi before something bad happens, but I wasn't expecting him to knock out two captain classed warriors in one attack like that." *She spoke on her breath, watching the captains fall face-first into the ground.*

Ridley: "Well, looks like it's just us."

Kath: "I thought we were going to attack them already?"

Ridley: "Despite our power, they are masters. I thought it would be wise to have the captains deal with the lower classed dancers-"

Kath: "So we don't waste our Neurons on weaklings."

Ridley: "Precisely."

Kath: "An expert point of vision." *She smirked and tightened her fists, causing the flames to brighten.*

Ridley: *He watched Cortax, Victoria, Lehi and Elizabeth form a square around them.* "Despite what I said earlier-"

*Ridley raised his arm and watched shadow swirl in his hand, causing a black sword to suddenly puff into his grip.*

Ridley: "ROTTING SWORD" *He lowered his arm, watching shadow swirl around the sword.* "Let's dance?"

Cortax: "Their Neurons, they're readying to attack." *He shouted, causing Lehi, Elizabeth and Victoria to stand in battle-ready poses.*

----------

*Luna and Kylie walked past Fast Food Enterprise, making their way towards the back door.*

Luna: *She looked into the store, noticing the lights from machines on standby.* (The mother hell went crazy, aye-)

Kylie: "Blahaha." *She giggled in excitement, catching Luna's attention.*

Luna: "Wat's up?"

Kylie: "Just.. The pills.. I'm gettin' excited."

Luna: "Yea, I know what you mean! It's like-.."

Kylie: "Somethin' to look forward to?"

Luna: "Yea! Aha." *She chuckled with Kylie and walked to the back of the store, noticing Kerry-Anne already waiting for them.*

Kerry-Anne: *She held an alcoholic bottle in one hand and noticed Luna and Kylie, causing her to smirk.* "'Sup?"

Kylie: "Gah, started before us, aye?" *She sounded impressed, looking at the bottle.*

Kerry-Anne: "Yeayah." *She smirked and leant off the wall, screwing on the lid to her bottle.*

Luna: *She stopped next to Kerry-Anne and sniffed the air, instinctively leaning back.* "Blah, your breath?"

Kylie: *She looked at Luna intrigued and leant forward, sniffing the area around Kerry-Anne.* "Kerry, when did you start drinkin' again?"

Luna: "Aye?" *She nodded her head in agreement and looked at Kerry-Anne, waiting for her answer.*

Kerry-Anne: "Started? No-"

Luna: "But-" *She pointed at the half drunken bottle in Kerry-Anne's hand.*

Kerry-Anne: "I haven't stopped."

Kylie: "Blahahah, nice!"

Luna: "Aha, yea!"

Kerry-Anne: "I try, I try." *She smirked in a confident-like manner and turned around, facing the back door to the store.*

Kylie: "How will we get in?"

Luna: "I wasn't too far away from my stupid brother, so he probably went through-" *She stepped forward and opened the back door, causing Kylie and Kerry-Anne to chuckle in evil-like manners.*

Kylie: "Are yas thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?"

Luna and Kerry-Anne: "Free feed?"

Kylie: "Blahaha!" *She laughed like a hyena and smirked in agreement, raising her arm.*

Kerry-Anne: "I'm cravin' some grease aye!" *She rubbed her stomach and raised her arm, ignoring the lively sounds down the street.*

Luna: "Food, get in me!" *She grunted with a widening smirk and raised her arm.*

Kerry, Luna and Kerry-Anne: "To free food!" *They clapped their hands in a triangular formation and staggered into the store.*

----------

Karol: *He pressed his ear against the door, whining in a worried-like manner.* "What's happening out there?!"

Trinity: "Chill, Karol."

Infinity: "And chill you must be."

Karol: *He turned around, rubbing his cold cheek from the stone wall.* "Aren't any of yooh wohwried?"

Trinity: "Not, worried. Our strong parents are out there."

Infinity: "And very strong they are."

*A girl dressed in fancy, dancer-like clothes stepped forward, catching Karol's attention.*

Girl: "My parents are out there too." *She spoke nervously, tugging on her extended white sleeves.*

Karol: "I know-" *He sounded worried and looked down to his large expensive looking boots.* "But, I can feel somefing out there."

Trinity: "Feel? Like Neurons? You can't! You're too young."

Infinity: "And young you are." *She nodded her head in agreement.*

Karol: (But..) *He turned back around and placed his hand on the door, causing a protective-like glyph to appear.*

Trinity: "Even if he wanted to, he can't break a sealing glyph performed by one of the adults." *She hissed under her breath in disgust.*

Infinity: "And stuck here, he remains."

----------

Cortax: "My love, are you okay?!"

Elizabeth: "I am!"

Lehi: "What about you, pumpkin?"

Victoria: "I'm fine. I had my amazing brother by my side."

Cortax: "Heh." *He smirked, glancing at Victoria.*

Ridley: "Pumpkin? Love?" *He shook his head with a sour face.* "Now I feel like a pumpkin flavoured cake, made with love." *He spoke, as if he was about to vomit.*

Kath: "I agree. Their battle taunts seem to be effective." *She pulled a disgusted facial expression.*

Lehi: "Battle taunts?"

Victoria: "A cake? How insulting."

Kath: "We are here to fight, not listening to your childish love nicknames."

Ridley: "Hahaha, no mercy for the damned!" *He stepped forward and sprinted towards Cortax at incredible speeds.*

Lehi: *He glared at Kath.* "Childish nicknames? Maybe you've forgotten what it's like to be in love with someone!"

Kath: *She smirked and pushed her glasses up with one finger, slowly turning around to face Lehi and Elizabeth.* "Hello, masters-"

Cortax: "Release your weapons!" *He reached over his shoulder and pulled forward, causing sparks to scatter around a blue metallic monologue clock.*

Victoria: "Power of the forbidden spirits, come to my command, with seraphic powers-"

*Victoria skipped with her toes and spun around, causing a purple glyph to draw itself on the ground around her.*

Victoria: "TELEPORTATION" *She shouted with an echoing voice, causing her boots to flash purple.*

Ridley: *He stared at the clock in Cortax's hands, causing him to chuckle in disgust.* "Counting down to your death?" *He smirked and raised the black sword, stepping into striking distance.*

Cortax: *He dragged his feet to each side and pushed forward, causing the clock's hands to spiral.* "CRIMSON BEAM"

*Cortax swayed to the side and pushed the clock forward, blasting a fluoro red beam towards Ridley.*

Ridley: *His face instantly lit up.* "How-?!" *He quickly raised the sword and slashed downwards, slicing the beam in half.*

Cortax: *He watched two fading beams warp on each side of Ridley.* (It wasn't incantation boosted, but it's impressive he broke its beam at such a close range!)

Ridley: *He observed the black sword and noticed steam, causing him to smirk in amazement.* "I'm seriously going to have fun with you."

Cortax: "Time freeze, three inverted stars gather-" *He stamped his feet and held the clock with one hand, allowing him to make punch-like dance movements.*

Ridley: "Hmph-" *He stepped forward and flashstepped directly in front of Cortax, slicing the sword across.* "Hah!-"

Cortax: "AYON RAPTURE" *He swayed the clock up, causing the air to shatter like glass around Ridley.*

Ridley: *He stumbled back and noticed his sword cut in two, causing it to puff into smoke.* "You broke my sword?"

Cortax: "As I suspected. You use Shadiatons too."

Ridley: "Shadiatons?"

Cortax: *He shook his head and stood in a battle-ready pose.* "You know nothing."

Ridley: "Oh? Sword of arts, this sword is the start, rot and decay, haste and make no delay, ROTTING SWORD"

*A swirl of black shadow-like smoke wafted around Ridley's hand, suddenly puffing into a long black sword.*

Ridley: "Shadiatons.. Knowing more than the Consultants. Precisely why you are a problem-"

Cortax: *He ignored Ridley and started to dance, causing a purple glyph to form underneath him.* "Time halt, the power of five inverted stars gather, hear my call-"

Victoria: *She looked down and stared at her feet, noticing she wore fluoro green and blue boots.* "Teleportation, successful."

Ridley: *He glanced at the sword full of confidence.* "Try breaking this sword?"

Cortax: "Fine! AYONSITE RAPTURE" *He shouted and swayed upwards, causing three vein-like cuts to crack the air like glass.*

Ridley: *He moved the black sword in a defensive-like manner, watching sparks violently flash on each side.* "Powerful, but compared to me-"

Victoria: *She skipped on her toes as if she was tap-dancing and a grey sigil-like glyph spiralled underneath her.* "Sacred dance, Neurons Up."

Ridley: *He watched the grey sigil-like glyph suddenly materialise around Cortax.* "What is that-?"

Victoria: "Activate!"

Cortax: *Victoria's words caused the glyph to spiral around him, before absorbing itself on to his skin.* "Nee hee, excellent-"

Ridley: "What did you-?"

*The ground suddenly cracked and burst around Ridley, causing him to grunt with widening eyes.*

Ridley: (His power just increased!)

Victoria: *She looked down with a smile, watching multi-coloured sparks flash around her boots with each tap.* (These powerful weapons, The Boots of Memories, I almost require no downtime between each Remenistal.)

Kath: *She watched Lehi reach to his side, causing her to punch bright yellow balls of fire towards him.* "FLAME BOLT"

Lehi: "Huh?!"

Elizabeth: "Lehi!"

Lehi: *He swayed his arm to the side, watching a slither of sparks hit the fireballs, causing them to explode prematurely.* (Phew, I was barely able to unsheathe my weapon.)

Kath: (They exploded before they made contact? Perhaps his weapon-)

Elizabeth: "Are you okay, Lehi-?"

Kath: "You should worry about yourself, little girl." *She punched to the side causing an eruption of green flames to spurt behind her, allowing her to glide across the ground.*

Elizabeth: (Green flames?!)

Lehi: *He watched the area glow green from Kath's flames, as she slid towards Elizabeth.* (A fire elemental.. I've got the advantage regarding affinities-)

*Lehi smiled in thought and held a whip's handle, watching a spurt of water sway out of it.*

Kath: "Your struggle is futile!" *She pushed up, causing a wave of flames to erupt over Elizabeth.*

Elizabeth: "Herh!" *She quickly jumped forward and watched the flames crash along the ground where she stood.* (Those flames are hot! I can feel the hot Astragons in the air from here!)

Kath: "You're mine, girl!"

*She punched downwards and jumped high into the air, leaving a swirl of green splinters from her flames.*

Elizabeth: (She's clearly mastered her element, using it to move at incredible speeds and to jump that high-) *She looked up, watching Kath punch a vortex of flames downwards.* "Lehi!"

Lehi: "Got it!" *He danced in a fluid-like manner, causing the water whip to swirl around him in an elegant manner.*

Elizabeth: *She cupped her hands and made slow but powerful movements, causing a white sigil-like glyph to appear around her face.* "Let the stars fall out-"

Kath: *Her glasses glowed green from the scorching vortex in front of her.* "FLAMING WHEEL-"

Elizabeth: "STARSCREAM" *She deeply inhaled and screamed out a scattered beam of white light.*

*The scattered beam of light hit the green flames, causing a sudden bright flare to light up the surrounding area.*

Kath: *She dived through the flames and kicked the ground in front of Elizabeth, knocking her back by a wave of green flames.* "I'll scorch your flesh-"

Lehi: "Fierceful storms, rain from the divine spirit of purity, power of the beast roaring through the waves, lend me your strength, AQUATIC DIVIDER"

Elizabeth: *She tumbled back and flipped over, sliding on her feet.* (It hurts!)

Kath: "Hmm?" *She glanced to each side, noticing two walls of water rumble towards her.* "No thanks, I'm not thirsty-"

Elizabeth: *She quickly covered her arm with her hand, watching blood ooze from instant burns.* (How was she able to move through flames unaffected-?!)

*Kath jumped to the side and spread her arms, watching streams of sand swirl around balls of fire.*

Kath: "Gravel and sand manipulate to my command, move like a drill and make them feel,
COMET'S VIEL" *She waved her hands and shot two comet-like boulders at each wave, causing an echoing steam-like hiss to be heard.*

Lehi: *He watched the walls of water burst around the boulders, causing it to rain heavily.* (She possesses high levelled Remenistal.. Despite their title, it's still four on two.)

Elizabeth: (Lehi's Aquatic Divider is powerful, but she still managed to out perform him-)

Kath: *She faced Lehi and cracked her fingers in a casual-like manner, slowly walking towards him.* "Powers of the neverending red, beat and skip through the winds-"

*Kath pointed at Lehi and watched a ring of green flames spiral around her finger, catching his attention.*

Lehi: *He flicked the water whip to one side, readying himself for Kath's attack.* "AQUA TALONS"

*Lehi waved up, causing streams of water to shoot up from nearby puddles towards Kath.*

Kath: "Unfathomable." *She smiled and hopped in every direction, closely avoiding the streams of water.* "You'd think a master could hit me at least once." *She smiled and felt sprinkles of water spray on her face from the passing streams.*

Lehi: *He noticed the ring of green flames flicker around Kath's finger.* (I couldn't even put out her-)

Kath: "FIRE'S PULSE" *She nudged her finger forward, causing a bright ring of green flames to suddenly swirl and explode in front of Lehi.*

Lehi: "Yargh-" *He shouted in pain and dropped his whip, causing the water to lose its current.*

Victoria: *She looked over Ridley and Cortax, staring at Lehi with widening eyes.* "Lehi!"

Elizabeth: *She frowned and ran towards Kath while swaying her arms in a dancer-like manner.* "How dare you."

Kath: "Oh? How frightening." *She smirked, pushing her glasses up with one finger.*

Elizabeth: *She swayed her arm behind her back and pulled forward, watching sparks scatter around a large golden staff with floating rings enveloping a jewel on the tip.* "Starburst."

*Elizabeth shouted in determination and ran into striking distance, jabbing the staff in Kath's face.*

Kath: "A combo based Azure Burst infused with Radiatons. Powerful, but rendered useless if the first hit doesn't connect-" *She elegantly spun around at blinding speeds, causing Elizabeth to awkwardly lunge forward.*

Elizabeth: (Such speed!-)

Kath: "Now you're mine, master!" *She punched towards Elizabeth's head, flaring a wave of green flames in her face.*

Victoria: *She tap-danced on the spot and waved her hands towards Elizabeth, causing a grey sigil-like glyph to form under her feet.* "Sacred dance, Speed Up."

Elizabeth: *She gasped and stepped forward at blinding speeds, barely avoiding the wave of flames.* (Close-)

Kath: "Hmm?" *She sounded unimpressed, glancing at Elizabeth in the corner of her eye.* (Her speed increased by four times-)

Elizabeth: (Much appreciated, Victoria!) *She faced Kath and flashstepped with heightened speed, appearing directly in front of her.*

Kath: "Useless-"

Victoria: "Sacred dance, Power Up." *She tapped the ground, causing an orange glyph to spiral underneath Elizabeth.*

Kath: "Amazing that none of you pawns have turned to ash yet-" *She casually raised her arm and readied to block the attack, as if she didn't care.*

Elizabeth: "Praise the dancers!" *She smirked at the glyph under her and slammed the staff on Kath's side, knocking her several feet back.*

Kath: *She gasped with a dropping jaw and tapped her leg, causing a burst of flames to stop her movement.* (How-?!)

Ridley: *He looked shocked and turned around, staring at Kath in disbelief.* (She knocked a Consultant back-?!)

Cortax: *He jumped into striking distance and swayed the clock down, causing a dark coloured burn to appear of Ridley's chin.* "Holy Neurons, that didn't kill you-?"

Ridley: *He flashstepped several feet back and touched his chin, mumbling to himself in a curious-like manner.* (His unusual choice of weapon has an unseen Astragon reach?)

Victoria: *She swayed to each side and dragged the tip of her foot across, causing a light blue glyph to form underneath Cortax.* "Sacred dance, Swift Up."

Cortax: (They might be stronger, but we'll use our numbers to keep them on edge!) *He jumped to each side, causing Ridley to quickly raise his black sword.* "Nyah-"

*Cortax jumped into striking distance and held his clock with one hand, throwing his arm upwards.*

Ridley: "How troubling-" *He slashed the sword across to block Cortax's movement.*

*The light blue glyph flashed underneath Cortax, allowing him to unnaturally twirl around Ridley and avoid his strike.*

Ridley: "What?"

Cortax: "The divine art bright as the holy sun, number eighty nine, CRIMSON BEAM" *He pushed the clock towards Ridley, blasting a fluoro red beam at his face.*

Ridley: "What-?!"

*Ridley quickly threw the black sword into the air and focused, watching smoke-like aura envelop the beam.*

Ridley: "Forceful sounds, radiate the ground, as deep as abyss, DARK STYX"

Victoria: *She watched the beam warp.* (Thank the Astragons, Cortax. A direct hit!-)

Ridley: *He swayed his arm, causing the warped beam to bend around him.* "Hahaha, the folly!"

Cortax: "How-?" *He lowered his arms, staring at the beam in shock.* (I've cancelled the Remenistal, but the beam is still active?)

Ridley: "Now!" *He pushed both hands in Victoria's general direction, causing the beam to blast towards her.*

Cortax: (He's somehow manipulating the beam?!) "Victoria!-"

Victoria: *She quickly formed a square with her hands and slapped them together, causing a white glyph to materialise underneath her.* "Neurons draw, Astragons repel, MYSTIC SHIELD"

*A bubble-like shield swirled around Victoria and suddenly solidified into glass, humming a bright silver light.*

Ridley: *He watched crimson flames with black shadowing hit the shield, causing the surrounding area to light up.* "Impressive."

Cortax: "Ougi." *He tightened his hands and closed his eyes, causing a bright purple glyph to materialise around him.*

Ridley: "Haha-"

Victoria: "I'll top off that already powerful Ougi of yours! Sacred dance, Neurons Up, sacred dance, Astragons Up." *She jumped up and enthusiastically tapped both feet on the ground, causing a white and purple glyph to glow underneath Cortax.*

Ridley: *He glanced between Cortax and Victoria.* (It's hard to focus on just one target-)

Cortax: "Words don't silence me, allow my power to be expressed through these movements you can't even comprehend, mystic arts shine by my emotions, come forth and show me your beauty-" *He spoke with an echoing voice, watching a small dark purple glyph spiral around him.*

Ridley: "You think I'd stand here and allow you to continue your Ougi's incantation?!" *He sprinted towards Cortax at incredible speeds, watching two black swords puff into his hands.* "ROTTING SWORD"

Victoria: (He's fast! Cortax won't have enough time!-) "Power of the forbidden spirits, come to my command, with seraphic powers, TELEPORTATION"

*Victoria swayed her arms around Ridley, causing him to disappear in a flash of purple light.*

Ridley: *He opened his eyes in disorientation and noticed he was high in the sky, causing him to grunt with widening eyes.* "She teleported me-"

*Ridley spoke on his breath and looked down, staring at the courtyard where he stood.*

Ridley: (Clever girl-) *He started to fall and took a deep breath, readying himself for a harsh landing.*

Victoria: *She looked directly up, staring at Ridley in a worried-like manner.* (With someone of such power, I could only forcefully transfer him in the same spot, but up in the air-)

Cortax: *The glyph around him glowed brighter, causing purple flower-like petals to erupt around him.* "Now!"

*Hundreds of petals swirled high into the air, causing insect-like brushing sounds to echo across the courtyard.*

Victoria: *She watched the hundreds of flower petals swirl in streams, causing her to smile.* (Besides our Hi-Ougi, Aubergine Blossom is one of the most beautiful Ougis I've ever seen-)

Cortax: "AUBERGINE BLOSSOM" *He spoke with an echoing voice and raised his arms, controlling the fluid moving strings of flower petals.*

Victoria: "It's over for you, Consultant."

Ridley: "Impudent, child!" *He ignored the beautiful appearing flower petals and focused his attention on to Victoria, suddenly throwing the black swords towards her.*

Cortax: "Nyah!" *He waved his arms towards Ridley, causing the strings of flower petals to violently swirl towards him.*

Ridley: "I'll merely counteract those flowers for you-"

Victoria: *She purposely faced the swords and spun around, causing an oval, reflective-like ripple to pulse in front of her.* "MOONLIGHT REFLECTION"

*Victoria shouted in determination and pushed forward, repelling the black swords back at Ridley.*

Ridley: "Excuse me-?" *Before he touched the ground the swords pierced past his shoulders, ripping the material of his shirt.*

Victoria: "Heh."

Ridley: *He quickly flashstepped backwards, watching three streams of flower petals jab into the ground where he stood, exploding the concrete.* "Impressive-"

Cortax: *He swayed his arms, frowning in concentration.* "Harh!"

Ridley: "Tssk." *He frowned and jumped high into the air, watching two streams of flower petals to shoot from behind where he stood.*

Cortax: (Almost got you cornered-) *He smiled, watching five streams of flower petals stream up towards Ridley from every corner.*

Ridley: "Tssk-" *He suddenly puffed into black smoke and appeared on the ground, noticing the entire area light up.* "What-?" *He looked up, noticing the bright purple explosion in the air.*

Victoria: *She gasped at Ridley's shocked reaction.* (I see a combination!-) "Neurons draw, Astragons repel, UNPROFOUND BIND" *She spread her fingers and clawed the air around Ridley, causing five transparent poles to suddenly jab into his neck.*

Ridley: "Kah-?! Y-You kink tis kan stohp me?" *He spoke with a struggle, trying to remove the poles around his neck.*

Victoria: "They aren't there to bind you, but-"

Ridley: *He violently grabbed the poles and shattered them, causing him to gasp for air.* "How dare-"

*Fluid-like strings of flower petals swirled around Ridley and instantly collided into each other, causing a violent explosion to pulse across the ground.*

Victoria: "But to keep you still." *She spoke with a smile.*

Ridley: *He jumped out of the violent swirl of purple petals, leaving a scattered trail behind him.* "How dare-" *He gritted his teeth in anger, noticing cuts all over his arms.*

Cortax: (No person has survived a direct attack from my Ougi!)

Ridley: (If our power wasn't on such a different level, we should've brought in all the captains-)

Cortax: *He swayed his arms up in a fluid-like manner, causing strings of flower petals to erupt up towards Ridley.* "You can't escape!"

Ridley: "Tssk! Swirling shadows flock, with the motion all will block, darkness strikes hearts with fear, NIGHT SPHERE" *A swirl of mist-like shadow whirled around him.*

Victoria: *She watched small bursts of flower petals hit the swirling shadow-like shield.* "It's another direct hit, but he seems to excel in both defensive and offensive Remenistal-"

Ridley: "Hah!" *He quickly spread his arms which caused the swirling shield to burst, scattering the petals around him.*

Cortax: *He stopped moving, causing all the flowers to lose their manipulated movement.* "Holy Neurons..."

Ridley: "And that's all of your Ougi.."

Cortax: *He lowered his arms, watching several of the flower petals disintegrate into nothing.* "..."

Ridley: "I believe it's time we wrap this up-" *Streams of flower petals suddenly swayed past him from behind, cutting his neck.*

Victoria: "MOONLIGHT REFLECTION" *She smirked in a victorious-like manner, listening to Ridley grunt in pain and shock.*

Ridley: (That dirty lamp reflected the attack after his Ougi finished!)

Cortax: *He reached up, causing the clock to spiral back into his hand.* "Awesome work, sis."

Victoria: *She took a deep breath, ignoring a bead of sweat which ran down her face.* "Any time."

Kath: "Foolish, girl." *She glared at Elizabeth, as if she was ready to kill.*

Lehi: *He moaned and slowly leant up, noticing smoke evaporate off the burnt parts on his clothes.* "Damn the Astragons."

Elizabeth: "We are proud dancers!" *She shouted and skipped towards Kath, raising the staff.*

Kath: "Proud?" *She pushed her body forward and a flare of green flames scorched behind her, allowing her to glide across the ground.*

Elizabeth: *She frowned, readying herself for Kath's inevitable attack.* "Yes!"

Kath: "Nuisance!" *She glided into striking distance and punched towards Elizabeth's face.*

Elizabeth: *She slammed the staff on Kath's arm, causing a spurt of green flames to blast high into the air.* "Rarh!"

Kath: *She watched the flames spew out of her fist in shock.* (She knocked my arm away before I could insinerate her face-?)

Elizabeth: "Rurh!" *She spiralled around, sweeping the staff across Kath's face.*

Kath: *She quickly ducked under the staff and tapped the ground, causing a wave of green flames to spurt towards Elizabeth.*

Elizabeth: "Flashing of the lights, MYSTIC FALLS" *A spiral of blinding light swayed in the air, before violently slamming into the flames.*

*Elizabeth took several steps back, watching the light block the wave of flames.*

Kath: *She frowned and waved her hand to the side, blowing away the splinters of flames.* "I grow tired of you-"

Elizabeth: "Same." *She spiralled the staff in her hands.*

Kath: "Pitiful-" *She flashstepped directly in front of Elizabeth and jabbed towards her face, causing a burst of flames to explode on her forehead.*

Elizabeth: *The flames knocked her back off her feet.* "Argh-" *She squinted her eyes and tumbled across the ground.*

Cortax: "My love!-" *A black sword shot past his face, drawing his attention to Ridley.*

Ridley: "Don't look away from me again." *He smiled in a casual-like manner.*

Elizabeth: *She came to a stop and slowly stood back on her feet.* "Dang-" *She frowned, rubbing burnt skin off her face.*

Kath: (How? That quick burst would have usually exploded a head!)

Lehi: (Elizabeth has the best Astragon control out of the rest of us. This allows her to place an Astral-like cloak around her. Normally, an attack like that would've killed someone-)

Kath: "Useless! Scorching screeches, hurdling down, miserable heat, FLAMING BLAZE"

*Fire ignited on the ground and suddenly ringed around Elizabeth, instantly bursting into a cage of green flames.*

Elizabeth: "No!"

Kath: "To finish you off, Ougi."

Lehi: (O-Ougi?!)

Cortax: *He gasped in terror, shaking his head.* "No!-"

Lehi: "I got this!-" *He jumped up, readying to sprint towards Kath.*

Kath: "Strings of fire ignite the foe, burn to ash, RIPPLING FIREY WEB" *She clicked her fingers, causing web-like strings of red fire to ripple up from the ground, binding Lehi's arms and legs.*

Lehi: "Argh!" *He shouted in pain, watching his clothes and skin sizzle around the web-like fire strings.*

Kath: "Bakana Flare." *She pointed both index fingers at Elizabeth and focused, causing the air around her to blur as if it was raining.*

Elizabeth: (Even her Astragon levels are out of my comprehension!-)

Victoria: (No! I have to pour the maximum amount of Neurons into this Remenistal!-) *She shouted in thought, intensely staring at Elizabeth in a worried-like manner.* "Neurons draw, Astragons repel, MYSTIC SHIELD"

Kath: "Hah!" *She pushed forward and a multi-coloured, volcanic-like eruption exploded underneath Elizabeth, leaving behind the sounds of her fading screams.*

Ridley: "Haha, that's finally one down."

Lehi: *He breathed through gritted teeth, trying to free his arms from the burning strings.* (Elizabeth!)

Kath: *She watched the ground crack and debris crack around the flames, as it brightly lit up the entire courtyard.* "You have been terminated.."

----------

Karol: *He felt the walls rumble, causing him to step back.* "W-What's happening out thair?!"

Infinity: "Be quiet, Karol."

Trinity: *She looked down, tapping her toes on the ground in a curious-like manner.* (Something doesn't feel right?)

Karol: *He ignored the growing mutters of fear from the teenagers, focusing all his attention to the glyphs on the wall.* "I-I will open it."

Infinity: "You may have one of the strongest bloodlines, but you're hopeless."

Trinity: "She's right, you are the only dancer of your bloodline to not produce an offensive Remenistal."

Karol: "B-But-"

Trinity: "You're a failure."

Infinity: "Yeah, a failure you are."

Karol: *He formed fists and lowered his head, as if he was about to cry.* ".. Me not using offensev attack doesn't mean I can't open a door-"

*The entire stone room started to shake and crack, causing one of the glyphs to shatter like glass.*

Infinity: "What did you do?!" *She spoke in shock, instinctively lowering her head.*

Karol: "Ngee-?!" *He squealed in fright and stumbled back, watching the shattering glyph disintegrate into nothing.*

Trinity: *She stared at the door and looked worried, as if she knew something was wrong.* (What is happening out there? That doesn't sound like The Purafetic Dance.)

Infinity: *She looked over her shoulder, watching teenagers point towards the door.* (It looks like the others want to know too-)

*Four young adults started to dance in front of the door, causing sigil-like glyphs to glow in response.*

Trinity: "What are you doing?!" *She watched the four young adults dance in sync.*

Young Man: "We're seeing what's happening outside!" *He shouted and suddenly stopped with the others at the same time, causing the two stone doors to open up, allowing moonlight to glow into the room.*

Karol: *He felt warm air blow into the room, causing him to frown in confusion.* (It was a cold night, why is it suddenly hot?)

----------

*The multi-coloured flames faded, revealing a half burnt Elizabeth standing inside a shattering white shield.*

Victoria: (Thank the Astragons!)

Elizabeth: *She leant to one side, watching her clothes singe into her skin.* "Harh.. Harh.. Harh.."

Kath: "Herm?" *She pushed her glasses up with one finger, staring at Elizabeth intrigued.* "How did you survive?"

Elizabeth: *She watched the shield disintegrate into nothing, before coughing out blood.* "Kargh!"

Ridley: "Oh my? I was certain that would've killed her, haha."

Elizabeth: *She groaned with each breath, trying to stay on her feet.* (For my city.. My son, Karol..) "Ougi." *She shouted with widening eyes, causing Kath to chuckle.*

Kath: "Just try-"

Elizabeth: "Angelic Celestic Siren." 

Kath: "Hrmm?" *Her eyes turned silver, causing Elizabeth to smirk.*

Elizabeth: *She glanced at Ridley.* "Now, destroy your partner."

Kath: *She noticed her arm slowly rise on its own accord, forming a fist towards Ridley.* (My Neurons? She's about to make me release my Remenistal-)

Elizabeth: "Now!-" *She gagged in mid-sentence and wheezed, as her eyes suddenly glowed an eerie yellow colour.*

Kath: "Hee hee hee.." *She casually lowered her arm, smirking in an impressed-like manner.* "You should not try to reach a level you have no chance of grasping in the first place."

Lehi: (What's happening? Why isn't Elizabeth's Ougi manipulating her movement?)

Kath: (I understand we are meant to keep them alive, but-) *Her eyes glowed an eerie yellow colour, causing Elizabeth to stop breathing.*

Cortax: "No!"

Elizabeth: "K-Kah-, harh, uh?" *She struggled to inhale and spoke with quivering lips, dropping to her knees.*

Lehi: (I will stop her!-)

Kath: "And you-" *She spoke in a stern voice without looking away from Elizabeth, filling Lehi with fear, as if he knew she was talking to him.*

Lehi: *He started to dance with his knees, causing a blue sigil-like glyph to form underneath him.* "Power of the deep depths, summon the soothing aqua and flow with the spirits that borrow your power, AQUATIC RAPIDS"

*A swirl of concentrated water whooshed around Lehi, extinguishing the web-like flames.*

Lehi: *He gritted his teeth and swayed his arms, causing the water to string towards Kath.* "Ougi."

Kath: "Using an Ougi while concentrating on an active Remenistal?" *She stepped to the side and glanced at Lehi, as a wall of fire exploded the water.* "Astonishing."

Lehi: *He watched steam sway around Kath, as black tattoo-like markings drew themselves all over his body.* "Sacrificial dance, unlock the watery gates of doom-"

Cortax: (Liz! Elizabeth's Neurons are fading!) *He shouted in thought, watching Elizabeth lay face-first on the ground.*

Victoria: *She tried to ignore Elizabeth, focusing her attention on Lehi.* "Sacred dance, Speed Up, sacred dance, Defence Up, sacred dance, Astragons Up."

Lehi: *Purple, grey and bronze glyphs spiralled around him, filling him with sudden confidence.* "Atlantic Storm."

Kath: "Atlantic Storm? Would that be the water version of the strongest shield based attacks-?"

Lehi: *Water formed like water droplets around him and stringed together, suddenly and closely swirling around him like a whirlpool.* (This is my trump card!)

Kath: (Despite our superior power, like summoners, these dancers can achieve powers far beyond their limits-) *She faced Lehi and formed fists, as if she was getting serious.* (And, I must not forget his Self-Inflicting Glyph, toppled with three stat boosting glyphs.. It would be very unprofessional of me-)

Ridley: "Your friend will be next-"

Cortax: "Vic, w-we need to Hi-Ougi!"

Victoria: *She looked shocked and stared Cortax with a hesitant frown.* "Healing Monarchs?!"

Ridley: (I was completely ignored-)

Cortax: "Yes."

Victoria: "But, we can't perform such a dance!"

Cortax: "My wife will die if we don't try."

Victoria: "I'll need to use my Ougi just as a stepping stone for us to use such a powerful technique."

Ridley: (Wait a minute. A technique that two master dancers can't perform properly? Either, this technique is rivalled to the legendary Seraphic Gate, or, they have yet to master that particular move-)

Victoria: "Ougi." *She formed a powerful stance and spread her arms, watching black tattoo-like markings appear all over her body.* "Sacrificial dance, unlock my entire being, Astral overload, Spirit Up."

*Swirls of six different coloured glyphs spiralled around Cortax and Victoria, causing multi-coloured tattoo-like glyphs to appear on their bodies.*

Ridley: (Those glyphs on their bodies are in colour? I know I should attack, but my researcher mind is far too curious to let a new technique go unseen.)

Cortax: (Excellent. Vic's Ougi allows a simultaneous boost of all status attributes. This will allow us to activate the strongest known technique we've successfully performed-)

Ridley: "I'm slightly worried, haha. Ougi, Daathic Nightwing." *Shadows moved like flames around him, slowly clustering into a gooey-like blob of darkness.*

*Bones suddenly spewed out of the blob, as it slowly started to form a skeletal-like creature.*

Cortax: *He looked at his hands, taking a deep breath of amazement.* (This power-)

Victoria: "Brother."

Cortax: *He quickly looked at Victoria and nodded his head.* "Ready."

Victoria: "It will hinder its power, but we won't have time to perform the full dance or incantation!-" *She spoke in an urgent-like manner, nudging her head towards Elizabeth's motionless body.*

Cortax: (I-I understand..)

Victoria and Cortax: "Hi-Ougi." *They shouted in synchronisation and white light shrouded their bodies, catching Ridley's attention.*

Ridley: *He squinted his eyes, as the light produced by Cortax and Victoria became brighter than the moon.* (What is that light? It's up to the point.. I can only see their silhouettes-)

Victoria and Cortax: "Healing Monarchs."

Ridley: "Tssk, attack them now!" *He shouted to the skeletal creature in front of him.*

Nightwing: "Skee!" *Its bones cracked and shaped its entire body into a spear, suddenly blasting itself towards the shadowing of Cortax's body.*

Ridley: (Excellent-) *He watched Cortax's silhouette break and scatter in the light, causing the Nightwing to scrape along the ground.*

Nightwing: "Skee!" *It screeched in pain, as its body started to eat itself from the light it jumped through.*

Ridley: *He frowned, listening to the Nightwing's fading screeches.* (It was destroyed merely by jumping through this technique's light?!)

Cortax: *He was blinded by the surrounding light, listening to holy flap-like noises.* (Vic, you go after Elizabeth, I'll stay on the offensive.)

Victoria: (Okay..)

Ridley: *The light slowly faded, revealing four lights shaped as flapping butterflies.* "What the-?"

Victoria: *Two butterflies flapped towards Elizabeth, each leaving white sparkling glitter behind them.* (With Cortax's ability to Hi-Ougi with no restriction of participants, and Elizabeth's ability to access Radiaton based Remenistal, Healing Monarchs has the potential to become the strongest known attack in history.)

*The butterflies flapped over Elizabeth and gently touched her, causing sparkling rings of white light to visibly heal her wounds.*

Ridley: (Radiatons?!) *He suddenly frowned in a jealous-like manner, focusing his attention to the butterflies above Elizabeth.*

Cortax: (No you don't!) *Two butterflies of light flapped around Ridley.*

Ridley: *He swayed his hand, hitting one of the butterflies away.* (That felt strange-)

Cortax: (CRIMSON BEAM) *A fluoro red beam suddenly blasted out from one of the butterflies, burning into Ridley's flesh.*

Ridley: "Ah! DEMONIC SIOVANCE" *He shouted with an echoing voice.*

*A black spear shot up from a black glyph on the ground, violently piercing into Cortax's butterfly.*

Cortax: (Argh!-) *The butterfly lost its light, revealing an orange and black butterfly, before disintegrating into nothing.*

Victoria: *She continued to swarm around Elizabeth, slowly healing her wounds with each gentle touch.* (Cortax!)

Cortax: (I'm fine!) *He flapped behind Ridley, readying to attack.* (It was smart splitting our power in two!)

Karol: *He ran outside with half of the city and leant over a stone balcony, looking down to the courtyard in the distance.* (E-Everyone is fighting?!)

*Trinity and Infinity held onto the balcony and looked into the distance, noticing Elizabeth on the ground.*

Trinity: "Aunty is down."

Infinity: "And down she is.." *She spoke in shock.*

Karol: "Our parents are fighting.."

Young Adult: "Why did they ask for our help?!" *He grunted to three other young men with a frown.*

Woman: "To leave the younger generation protected."

Young Adult: "Tssk." *He gritted his teeth, hesitantly nodding his head in understanding.*

Lehi: *He slid towards Kath and swayed his arm, flicking a stream of high pressured water into the ground.* "Hah!"

Kath: *She watched the water burst into the ground, listening to the ground crack in response.* "I believe it's time we finish this little ordeal, Ridley."

Ridley: "This appalling behaviour on our part must stop."

Kath: *She smirked and flashstepped next to Ridley, watching water shoot out of the ground where she stood.* "Time to terminate these dancers."

Lehi: (Missed!-)

Kath and Ridley: "Hi-Ougi."

Victoria: (A Consultant levelled Hi-Ougi?!) *She suddenly hovered in the air, as if she was shocked by their announcement.*

Woman: *She watched black flames take shape in front of Ridley and Kath, causing her to gasp with a dropping jaw.* "Everyone, back into the room now!" *She screamed in an urgent-like manner, catching everyone's attention.*

Young Adult: "Why?"

Woman: "My ability is able to sense people's Neurons! Get back in the room now!"

Young Adult: *He nodded his head, quickly pushing the children back into the room they came from.* "Go, everyone!"

Trinity: "But our parents!-"

Karol: (Those Neurons... I-It's hard to breathe-) *He took short quick breaths before suddenly passing out.*

----------

Kylie: "Who'd be dumb enough to leave the store open during the night of Sceldrant's Comet?" *She walked through the kitchen, noticing a ladder leading to the roof.*

Luna: "Yea." *She reached into a large box of nuggets, chewing with her mouth closed.*

Kerry-Anne: "They must be up there?" *She slurred her words, stumbling towards the ladder.*

Luna: *She consumed another nugget and noticed the box was empty, causing her to angrily throw it on the floor.* (Why did I eat that?! I was hungry.. But, now I feel fat-)

Kylie: "C'mon, Loonz." *She smirked and stopped at the ladder, implying Luna to go first.*

Luna: "Why me?!"

Kylie: "Your brother."

Kerry-Anne: "Ya." *She smirked and hiccuped, quickly grabbing onto the ladder before she lost balance.*

Luna: "Wateva." *She grunted and started to climb up the ladder, noticing her black hair sway in the outside breeze.*

Kylie: "Wat's up there?" *She started to climb up the ladder, closely followed by Kerry-Anne.*

Luna: *She discreetly poked her head outside, noticing everyone intensely staring at the sky.* (Everyone is here-)

Rachael: "The sky is like a rainbow."

Melinda: "It has something to do with the atmosphere, like in the poles."

Ashton: "Like in the poles?"

Melinda: "Well, what we're looking at right now-"

Lance: "Are colours in the sky-"

Melinda: *She ignored Lance.* "Is the end result of the sunlight that has penetrated the Earth's gravitational barrier-"

Lance: "Err, it ain't day? No sunlight."

Melinda: "Well, I'm just letting you all know what I'm seeing with my own eyes right now-"

Rachael: "Sorry to interrupt, Mel but what is this called? I remember your mum showing me pictures at your place."

Melinda: "She dubs it The Aurora Skies. To sum things up, we should not be able to witness this from where we are."

Tyler: "W-We shouldn't?" *He looked slightly nervous.*

Twortz: "I underestimated this occurrence, it's very beautiful."

*The comet glowed brighter and reacted with the air, causing rays of warped rainbows to scatter the air.*

Ashton: "Looking at this, kind of makes you feel insignificant. Doesn't it?"

*The party unintentionally ignored Ashton, as they continued to stare at the sky in awe.*

Lance: (What is this feeling?)

Luna: (I feel somethin'? It's coming from inside-?) *She looked down to her chest, frowning at herself with uncertainty.*

*The stone started to glow the same colours as the sky, causing it to hum.*

Rachael: "Does anyone else hear that?"

*The stone suddenly shined as bright as the comet, instantly drawing the party's attention to the backpack.*

Twortz: "What's in your bag-?"

Luna: (No! My arms, they're getting weak-) *She sighed in thought and let go of the ladder, falling on top of Kylie and Kerry-Anne.*

Kylie: "Argh-"

Kerry-Anne: "Bwarh-?!"

Rachael: "Ash..."

Ashton: "R-Rach..."

*The stone released a blinding light and a powerful shock wave, rendering Ashton, Tyler, Melinda, Rachael, Twortz, Luna, Kylie and Kerry-Anne unconscious.*

Lance: (H-Huh, feeling sleepy-) *He watched the stone shatter into tiny white orbs, before falling unconscious.*

----------

Young Adult: *He stood with five other adults, all staring at the courtyard with dropping jaws.* "W-What was.. Phoenix Blaster?"

Ridley: *He took a deep breath, watching Elizabeth, Cortax, Victoria and Lehi lay on the ground unconscious.* "I didn't think we'd have to resort to such extremities."

Kath: "Termination can be hard on others.." *She watched smoke sizzle off melted stone.*

Ridley: "Healing Monarchs.. Have you ever heard of such a technique?"

Kath: "No." *She wiped sweat off her forehead and turned around, slowly looking up with an evil-like smirk.* "What to do with the other dancers?"

Ridley: *He looked over his shoulder and stared at an enormous stone wall, harvesting many openings, balconies and stairs.* "It's a shame I won't be able to explore this amazing city."

Kath: "Number three, nine, take these prisoners to Sorrowprax and await further instructions." *She spoke in a stern voice and flashstepped without waiting for the captain's response.*

Ridley: *He watched Nancy and Cassandra slowly stand back up on their feet, causing him to disappear in a puff of smoke.*

Young Adult: "This is bad-"

Kath: "Indeed it is." *She suddenly appeared behind the young adult, causing them to gasp in shock.*

Young Man: *He started to dance, causing an orange glyph to form underneath him.* "You will pay!"

Woman: "For our masters!" *She swayed her arms and frowned, watching a square brown glyph spiral in front of her.*

--

*Distressed whines of the younger children flooded the confined room.*

Karol: *He slowly regained consciousness, finding himself inside the stone room with the other children.* (Why am I in here? My daddy and mummy are out there!-)

*Five young adults flew into the room and rolled across the ground, causing the entire room to become silent.*

Woman: (W-What happened-?!) *She spoke in disbelief, watching Kath and Ridley slowly walk inside the room, giving a sense of intimidation.* "W-Who are you?!"

Ridley: "Hmm?" *He stood in a professional-like manner, glancing at the woman.*

Kath: "You will speak when spoken to!" *She formed a fist, causing Ridley to lower her arm.* "Ridley?" *She sounded unimpressed.*

Ridley: "I have no intentions of undermining you, but, look at what we just stumbled upon."

Kath: "Hrmm?" *She scanned across the room, staring at the crying faces of the younger children.* "I see useless children?"

Ridley: "You do? I see the next generation of warriors at our command-"

Trinity and Infinity: "Duel finger snap, flying palm strike." *They spoke at the same time and pushed forward, forcing Ridley back.*

Ridley: *His feet slid back.* "Such power for little girls-"

Kath: "Impudent children-" *She swayed her hand to the side, blasting the girls off their feet.*

*Kath's power caused all the dancers to stop what they were doing, as if they understood the threat in front of them.*

Karol: (Sh-She didn't even touch them and they fwell on the gwound!) *He stuttered in thought.*

Trinity: *She leant up and sat on her knees with her head lowered.* "Please, we will do anything."

Infinity: "Anything we will." *She lowered her head, mimicking Trinity's posture.*

Ridley: "The folly." *He spoke in disgust, glancing across the room.* "Two young girls appear to have a louder voice than the adults in this room?"

Karol: *He shivered in fear, intensely staring at Kath's eerie yellow eyes.* (H-H-Her eyes are glowing.. They're so sckary looking.)

Kath: *She spread her arms and focused on the ground, watching an enormous dark purple glyph draw itself on the floor.* (I will teleport everyone to the detention centre in Sorrowprax..)

Ridley: *He stared at the twin sisters with a smile, as if he was planning something.* "You'll do anything-?"

Karol: "W-Wha-?!" *He squealed and suddenly ran past Kath out of the room.*

Trinity: *She listened to Karol's fading footsteps, causing her to frown with mixed emotions.* (He ran away?!)

Kath: *She watched the glyph begin to glow a light purple colour, causing her to lower her hands.* "I shall exterminate the child."

Ridley: "No need. He looked no older than five or six, it doesn't matter."

Kath: "Your point being?"

Ridley: "Without anyone else in the city, he won't survive long."

Kath: "Perhaps."

Ridley: *He stepped forward, smirking at Trinity and Infinity.* "I was impressed with your dual technique from before."

Trinity: "..."

Infinity: "Yes-?" *She watched all the people in the room beside Ridley, Kath and her sister disappear in a flash of purple light.*

Trinity: *She turned around, gasping at the empty room.* "Where-?!"

Ridley: "If you wish to see your friends and family again, I highly suggest you do what we say."

Kath: "Or, you will be terminated." *She smirked, glaring at the sisters with her eerie yellow eyes.*

Trinity: "We will do what you say."

Infinity: "And say what we shall do."

Kath: "Excellent."

Ridley: "Marvellous. Shall we retire to Sorrowprax?"

Kath: "Yes." *She smirked and clicked her fingers, causing the party to suddenly disappear in a flash of purple light.*

----------

*Karol ran with tears running down his cheeks, making his way towards a dead end.*

Karol: (I-I'm far away from those people-) *He sniffed and slowed down, staring at a stone door.*

*Karol started to dance, causing painted glyphs on the stone door to light up.*

Karol: *He watched the stone door open, allowing him to squeal in terror towards it.* (Everwyone.. Everwyone is gone! I can feel it!)

*Karol ran into the corner of a room and curled up into a ball, hysterically crying into his own lap.*

Chapter 2: Rostical

*Twortz moaned and groaned, slowly waking up in an unfamiliar setting.*

Twortz: *She looked to the side and noticed Rachael, lying beside her unconscious.* "Rachael-"

Rachael: "Hmm?"

Twortz: (It's day-?) *She looked up through the swaying tree branches, staring at the sky with double vision.*

Rachael: "Where-?" *She frowned and closed her eyes, holding the side of her head.*

Twortz: "Oh dear.." *She slowly stood up, noticing kitchen utensils lying around her.* "What on Earth happened?"

Rachael: "Twortz?"

Twortz: *She quickly spun around, facing Rachael in relief.* "Rachael, you're awake."

Rachael: *She stood up and rubbed her head, observing the area around her.* "We're in a forest?"

Twortz: "But we were on the roof at.. My store?"

Rachael: "I know?"

Twortz: "I swear, if this is some sort of joke, I will be going to the authorities!" *She looked down, brushing dirt off her work uniform.*

Rachael: "I'm with you hey-"

*A prehistoric-like roar echoed in the distance, instantly catching Rachael and Twortz's attention.*

Rachael: "What the bloody hell was that?!"

Twortz: (I-Impossible?! I couldn't recognise what animal that was!-)

Rachael: "Th-That sounded like it came from a Jurassic movie!"

Twortz: *She suddenly frowned, forming fists.* "Lance, get out here now!"

Rachael: (Lance?) *She looked puzzled and slowly nodded her head in agreement.* (Twortz is right, this is something Lance would do.)

?????: "Captain, the Scoldrant is up here somewhere!" *A man's voice yelled out in the distance, catching Twortz and Rachael's attention.*

Rachael: "A captain?"

Twortz: (A Scoldrant?) *She thought to herself in confusion and stepped forward, accidentally standing on a frying pan.* "Oh?"

Rachael: *She looked down to the ground, noticing the kitchen utensils.* "It looks like someone just grabbed us and a whole bunch of stuff from work and-"

?????: "Captain, it's over here!-"

?????: "Grsraaahgh!" *Another prehistoric-like roar echoed in the distance, followed by screams of pain.*

Rachael: "It sounds like an animal attack!" *She spoke in determination and started to jog down the dirt path towards the sounds.*

Twortz: "Usually when you hear screams in a forest, you run the other way-"

Rachael: "Come on, Twortz."

Twortz: "Erh.." *She sighed and picked up the frying pan, readying to chase after Rachael.* (I don't want to go, but I don't want to be left here by myself.) "If it's an animal, do you want me to pick something up for you?"

Rachael: "No! I already checked. The only thing other than the frying pan would be tongs."

Twortz: *She looked down and nodded her head with surprise.* (She's right. Wherever we are, I'm glad I'm with Rachael.)

Rachael: "Besides, I do Hapkido!"

Twortz: "Hapkido?" *She awkwardly waddled to each side and panted heavily, trying to catch up to Rachael.*

Rachael: (I was thinking this could've been a prank too, but why? Lance may be, annoying, disrespectful and stupid, but he's never a rule breaker..-)

?????: "Argh!" *A man's gargled scream caught Rachael's attention.*

Rachael: (Over here-) *She took a sharp left and continued to follow a dirt path, noticing bright light at the end of it.*

*A woman with short red hair in platinum armour smirked, as a creature suddenly burst into tiny white orbs.*

?????: "You lot had this much trouble, eh?"

Man: *A man covered in armour, dropped down to one knee, causing the armour to rattle.* "My apologies, captain."

Captain: *She sighed, shaking her head in a disgusted-like manner.* "How many casualties?"

Man: "Ma'am?"

Captain: *She sighed.* "If this goes on my record, I might not be able to get back into The Black Brigade if I ever wanted to join them again."

Man: "Only one, ma'am."

Captain: "Tssk." *She grunted and turned around, as if she was ready to leave.* "The Rostical Using Scoldrant has been eliminated. Back to Sorrowprax."

Rachael: *She ran out into the clearing, instantly noticing the woman with red hair.* "People!" *She whispered to herself in excitement, carelessly running towards her.*

Warrior: *A woman with the number ninety three engraved on her back armour noticed Rachael.* "Captain?"

Captain: "Eh?" *She turned around and leant to one side, placing a hand on her waist.* (I don't sense any Neurons or Astragons from her-)

Rachael: "Hey! Someone was yelling, is everything okay?"

Captain: "..."

Rachael: *She stopped and glanced at the captain.* "Well.. My name's Rachael, do you mind telling me where we are?"

Captain: "Where we are? Are you joking?"

Rachael: "No?" *She sounded confused.*

Captain: (I don't have time for this shit.) *She grunted in thought and turned around, slowly walking away.*

Rachael: "Ah?" *She noticed the other warriors slowly follow the red headed woman.* "Could any of you tell me what's going on?"

Captain: "Grr.." *She frowned with a twitching eye.* "Go away."

Rachael: "Huh? Then just point to the closest town and I'll be on my way."

Captain: "Eh?" *She paused in mid-step, catching a nearby warrior's attention.*

Warrior: (Our captain, PKMY, pronounced Pee-Kay-Me, has the shortest temper of all current single digits. Not even that crazy Nancy captain is as scary when-)

PKMY: *She slowly turned around, facing Rachael.* "Are you telling me what I should do?"

Rachael: "Well, if you want me out of your hair, just tell me where to go?"

PKMY: "Wat about my hair?" *She grunted, looking up to her forehead.*

Rachael: "Oh brother." *She sighed and turned around, slowly shaking her head.* "Don't worry, I'll find my own way-, kah?!"

PKMY: *She suddenly appeared behind Rachael with her fist sticking through her chest.* "Heh."

Rachael: *She looked down, gasping with widening eyes.* "I-Is that a.. Hand?"

PKMY: "Yeah." *She smirked and looked over Rachael's shoulder, watching blood drip from her fist.*

Warrior: (Our captain just flashstepped and punched that woman straight through the chest!)

Rachael: *She coughed out blood and slowly looked over her shoulder, staring at the side of PKMY's head.* "Why?"

PKMY: "Pfft." *She pulled back and ripped her arm out of Rachael's chest.* "Even at a young age, children are raised to be more respective to single digit warriors."

Rachael: *She dropped to her knees and noticed white orbs float off her shoulders.* (What is this feeling? It's like.. I can feel life going out of me, but.. I feel life going into me?)

*Rachael coughed up blood and placed her hands on the ground, digging her fingers into the dirt.*

PKMY: "You're dead.. I hope you learnt to keep your mouth shut."

Rachael: (This feeling, the dirt, the Earth.. I can feel it-) *She suddenly burst into tiny white orbs, leaving a patch of blood on the dirt where she stood.*

PKMY: "Eh? She turned into Roharnia even though I felt no power from her-?" *She whispered on her breath, watching the orbs float high into the air.*

Warrior: "Captain?"

PKMY: "I know-" *She turned around and flashstepped, suddenly appearing next to the warrior.*

Warrior: *He leant back slightly startled.* (I can't wait to one day learn how to flashstep.)

Twortz: (Dead..?) *She watched the warriors leave her sight, as she kept hidden in the forest Rachael ran out of.* (R-R-Rachael.. Died?)

*The white orbs flashed and glowed in mid-air, as if they were charging power.*

Twortz: (Where did her body go?)

*The orbs slowly floated back down to the ground, causing Twortz to intensely stare at them.*

Twortz: "W-What is that light?" *She cautiously stepped into the clearing and slowly shuffled her feet towards the falling orbs of light.*

*The light absorbed themselves into the ground, causing the dirt to flicker with life.*

Twortz: *She awkwardly held onto the frying pan, ignoring the beads of sweat which dripped off her face.* (I need a rest-)

*The dirt moved and an arm suddenly erupted out of the ground, followed by a dirt covered woman.*

Twortz: "Yckee?!" *She squealed and dropped the frying pan, causing it to loudly rattle at her feet.* "Huh?" *She looked down, staring at the dirt around the pan in confusion.*

?????: "Ah?"

Twortz: *She stared at the woman, gasping with widening eyes.* (That's not possible?!) "R-Rachael?"

Rachael: "My head?" *She gently brushed dirt out of her hair and stood up, noticing she was covered in dirt.*

Twortz: (I saw her die.. This.. Can't be her-)

Rachael: "Twortz?"

Twortz: "Ah, ahem. Yes?"

Rachael: "Where did that red haired woman go?"

Twortz: "U-Uhm.." *She awkwardly looked to each side, as if she was unsure how to handle the situation.*

Rachael: "Hehe." *She giggled at Twortz.*

Twortz: "Excuse me?" *She spoke in a stern-like manner, as if she was unsure she was insulted.*

Rachael: "Hehe, it's just.. It's unusual seeing you so unprofessional." *She smiled, brushing dirt off her arms.*

Twortz: *She silently stared at Rachael and looked away, as if she was awkward being in her presence.* "Well.. What should we do?"

Rachael: *She cracked her knuckles and smirked in a casual-like manner.* "Well, we should check out the closest town or city? Find a local payphone and get a taxi?"

Twortz: *She nodded her head in a professional-like manner and awkwardly leant down to pick up the frying pan, keeping a cautious eye on Rachael.* "Yes. That would be the best course of action."

Rachael: "So." *She turned around and placed her hands on her waist in a cheerleader-like manner.* "Where the heck do we go?"

Twortz: *She looked around, observing the clearing around her.* (I wouldn't have a clue. I have no idea where we are..)

Rachael: "Twortz?"

Twortz: "Yes, right. Let's go." *She nodded her head and started to walk across the grassy field.*

Rachael: "Where do you think we are?" *She cracked her knuckles and started to jog up to Twortz, looking to each side.*

Twortz: "Those hills in the distance. I think we're on the outskirts of Dee Highs."

Rachael: "Oh? Where the train goes past?"

Twortz: "Yes."

----------

*Luna, Kerry-Anne and Kylie all suddenly twitched, slowly regaining consciousness.*

Luna: "Gah.." *She groaned and frowned, slowly opening her eyes.*

Kylie: "Aye?" *She awkwardly pushed herself up, glancing at Kerry-Anne and Luna.* "What bloody happened?"

Kerry-Anne: "Blargh, this is the worst hangover, ever."

Luna: (Did I hit my head on the ground or somethin'?) *She felt her head, whimpering in an annoyed, frustrated-like manner.*

Kylie: *She shook her head and widened her eyes, as if she was just waking up.* "Outside?"

Luna: *She observed the area, noticing its brown dead-like appearance.* "Are we in a swamp?"

*Frogs and insects could be heard in the background, complimenting the sounds of popping liquid.*

Kerry-Anne: "Swamp? The hell we get ina swamp?" *She slurred in a frustrated-like manner, reaching for her half empty bottle.*

Kylie: *She looked at her hands, noticing they were covered in mud.* "Rank as."

Luna: "So.. What. The. Hell..?"

Kerry-Anne: "I swear, I'm just intoxicated?" *She looked across the swamp and shook her head in shock, taking a manly sip from the bottle.*

Luna: "I'm gonna take a stroll around the place, aye."

Kylie: "Be sure to get us some water, aye!"

Luna: "Will do."

Kerry-Anne: "The mud?" *She slurred in confusion, noticing Luna's shoes slightly sink in the muddy ground.*

Luna: "I got this." *She sniffed in confidence and awkwardly lifted her feet with each step, trying to avoid the mud.*

Kylie: *She held her wrists, slightly squinting her eyes in pain.* (Shit, it hurts..)

Kerry-Anne: "Man, this is good shit."

*Luna walked past several dead appearing trees and sighed, as if she didn't know what to do.*

Luna: (What have I gotten myself into now..?) *She thought with quivering lips and rested her back against a tree, looking down to her mud covered shoes.*

*Cat-like hisses echoed in the distance, instantly catching Luna's attention.*

Luna: (Kitties?) *She sounded curious and stepped forward, ignoring her current situation.*

*Luna listened to the sounds of squishy mud under her feet and continued to walk towards the hisses.*

Luna: *She looked to each side and continued to walk into the darkening swamp.* (What kind of kitties live in a swamp?)

?????: "Yeup!"

*A cat-like growl caused Luna to quickly look to the side.*

Luna: (Whatever it is, it sounds like it's in pain.) *She looked up to thick tree tops, noticing a swarm of floating purple hairballs.* (What the fuck are they-?!)

?????: "Yeup!-" *It hopped on the ground, meowing in pain.*

Luna: (They're like, little fur balls?!) *She looked down, noticing the hopping hairball in curiosity.* (That one looks like it can't float-)

*The swarm of hairballs floated down towards the hopping one and started to hiss out shots of air.*

?????: "Yeup!" *Its fur swirled with each hiss, causing it to meow in pain.*

Luna: (Why are they pickin' on it?) *She paused at the hopping creature with a dropping jaw, triggering a flashback.*

----------

*Luna walked down a long corridor, listening to the school-like environment around her.*

Luna: *She stopped at a locker and punched it open, causing a group of girls dressed in matching cheerleader-like uniforms to snicker.* "Wat?!"

Girl A: "Look at you, dressed in black."

Girl B: "Yeah, like, you're totally, like, weird."

Girl A: "Totally." *She leant on the side and opened her hand, causing one of the girls to hi-five her.*

Girl B: "Shouldn't you be asleep, Lunadracular?"

Luna: "Wat?!"

Girl A: "Weirdo!"

Girl B: "Totally weird!"

Girl A: "You're different."

Girl C: "Strange." *She shivered in disgust.*

Girl A: "You had your chance to be one of us."

Luna: *She frowned with quivering lips and slammed the locker door, quickly storming away.* "Idiots-"

Girl A, B and C: "Oooo."

Girl A and B: "Luna-dracular!"

Girl C: "Teeheeheehe."

----------

Luna: (Lunadracular?) *She whispered in thought.*

?????: "Yeup!" *It meowed in pain, as it tried to hop away.*

Luna: (Are they picking on that thing because it doesn't float?) *She shook her head with an awkward smirk.* (Aha, for some reason, I don't seem to give a shit about a floating furball, but the fact it's gettin' picked on.)

*The hairballs continued to swarm around the hopping creature, hissing at it like they were bullies.*

Luna: "Oi! Why you pickin' on it!" *She shouted and stormed towards the hairballs, catching their attention.*

?????: "Hsssht!" *It hissed, glaring at Luna with its large bug-like eyes.*

Luna: "Gaghraghr, yaself!" *She screamed and quickly picked up a rock, instantly throwing it towards them.*

?????: *The rock hit one of the hairballs and broke into crumbs on dirt, causing it to squeal in fright.* "Hierrrk?!"

Luna: "How you like bein' picked on, aye?!" *She screamed and picked up another rock, trying to intimidate the hairballs.*

*The hairballs meowed and hissed, quickly floating into the distance and out of Luna's sight.*

Luna: "Yea, that's what I thought, dipshits!" *She screamed into the distance and formed a fist, causing the rock to crumble in her hand.*

?????: "Y-Yeup?" *It shivered on the spot and stared at Luna, as if it was unsure what to do.*

Luna: "Umm, 'sup?" *She looked awkward, as if she was also unsure what to do.*

?????: "Yeup?" *It hopped with hesitation towards Luna, causing her to step back.*

Luna: *She gasped in realisation, taking another step back.* (What am I doing?! What the hell is that?! It's a bloody floatin' hairy ball of death thing!)

?????: "Yeup?" *It started to rub itself against Luna's leg in a cat-like manner and started to purr.*

Luna: "W-What?" *She looked down and watched the purple hairball continue to rub itself against her leg in an affectionate-like manner.*

?????: "Yeu."

Luna: (Hey, you ain't so bad-)

*A scream echoed in the distance, causing Luna to quickly look over her shoulder.*

Luna: (That sounded like Kylie?!)

----------

*Twortz and Rachael walked along several meadow-like hills, listening to powerful waves crash in the distance.*

Rachael: *Her hair swayed in the gentle cool breeze.* "Sounds like we're near the beach, huh?"

Twortz: *She took deep breaths, struggling to keep up to Rachael.* "Rachael, could we please rest?"

Rachael: "Rest?" *She turned around without a sign of fatigue and nodded her head in realisation, as if she didn't need to rest.* (I forgot, due to Twortz's unhealthy lifestyle, she wouldn't be able to keep up.)

Twortz: "You're probably thinking, how could I keep up with my weight?"

Rachael: "U-Uhm? Kinda." *She smiled awkwardly.*

Twortz: "I like your honesty. But to be realistic, we've walked for more than an hour. Even someone fit would be a little bit sweaty or out of breath by now."

Rachael: "True." *She nodded her head in agreement and sat on her knees, playing with her fingers.* (When I'm training or paintballing, I do sweat a little.. It's weird though, I don't feel out of breath at all?)

Twortz: "Kah-" *She collapsed to her feet, quickly placing her hands on the ground.* (It's so hard to breathe-)

*Twortz dropped the frying pan and it hit the ground, causing a loud sound to blow the grass back.*

Rachael: "Whoa, nice! Hehe, how did you do that?" *She smirked and crawled up to Twortz, picking up the frying pan.*

Twortz: "It couldn't have done that. Maybe it was just a coincidental breeze-?"

Rachael: "Ha!" *She slammed the frying pan on the ground, listening to a faint thud-like noise.* "Huh? Think you're right, Twortz."

Twortz: "Ahem." *She nodded her head and took a deep breath, trying to recollect her professional-like composure.*

Rachael: "It's cool. Take as much time as you need. I'm in no hurry." *She smiled, causing Twortz to smile back.*

Twortz: (She's.. Not the same..) *She thought in a serious-like manner, continuing to fake her smile.* (She acts completely the same, but, this gut feeling I have-)

Rachael: *She looked up, staring at the sky.* "Shame we don't have Mel, or even Lance's sister."

Twortz: "Why?" *She frowned in confusion and slowly reached forward, grabbing the frying pan off Rachael.*

Rachael: "Well, they're both apparently good with the stars."

Twortz: "How would that help? I think a compass-" *She gasped in realisation, quickly patting her pockets.*

Rachael: "What is it?" *She leant forward in an intrigued-like manner.*

Twortz: "This-" *She pulled out a mobile phone and pressed a button, sighing in failure.* "Dang, the screen's cracked."

Rachael: "Your phone-" *She spoke on her breath and triggered a flashback of leaving her phone in the manager's office.* (Damn.)

Twortz: "Alright." *She slowly inhaled and stood up, brushing her knees in a professional-like manner.* "Let's continue."

Rachael: "But we hardly had enough time to-"

Twortz: "It's fine. The sooner we call for help, the faster I get to have a nice long bath at home."

Rachael: "Right." *She smiled and stood up with a bounce, forming a fist in determination.*

----------

Kerry-Anne: "What the hell is th-that?!" *She stuttered in fear, intensely staring at a weed-like creature with a large head.*

Kylie: "Look at its bulbie looking head." *She stared at the thin creature's bulb shaped head, staring at its one eye.* "It looks like an ugly weed with a blue eye?"

Kerry-Anne: *She stared at the creature and hiccuped, focusing her attention to the bottle in her hand.* "This is the best alcohol ever."

Weed-like Creature: "Tsssst-t-t-t?" *It sniffed through two tiny slits on its face, as if it was inspecting Kylie.*

Kylie: *She smirked and reached out, as if her fear was fading away.* "Hey, it ain't that bad."

Kerry-Anne: "Aye?" *She took another sip from the bottle and stepped forward, staring at the creature with blurred vision.* "It's as skinny as that dickhead you once liked."

Kylie: "Oi-"

Weed-like creature: *It suddenly stopped its slow agile-like movement, focusing its attention on Kylie's wrist.* "Tsss?"

Kylie: "Naww, I think he likes me-"

Kerry-Anne: "Wanna be careful?"

Kylie: "It's kool-"

Weed-like Creature: *Its eye suddenly split open, revealing four sets of razor sharp teeth.* "Tssst!"

Kylie: "What the fu-?!"

Weed-like Creature: *It violently bit into Kylie's arm and ripped it off, causing her to scream in agony.*

Kylie: "Argh!"

Kerry-Anne: "Maybe this isn't the best alcohol-?"

Kylie: *She whimpered with watering eyes, taking a step back in shock.* "My.. My arm...?" *She screamed in terror and disbelief.*

Weed-like Creature: "Tss-" *It mauled on Kylie's hand before spitting the arm towards Kerry-Anne.*

Kerry-Anne: *She looked down, spitting out a spray of alcohol in disgust.* "Holy fuck-"

Weed-like Creature: "Tssk-t!-" *It suddenly struck like a snake, biting into Kylie's neck.*

Kerry-Anne: "Kylie!-" *She stepped forward, as if she wanted to help.*

Kylie: "R-Run.. Ck." *She spat out blood and her eyes rolled back, causing her to fall into the creature's arms.*

Kerry-Anne: "Fuck this!" *She screamed and spun around in a drunken-like manner, awkwardly sprinting away from the creature.*

Luna: *She ran into the small clearing, instantly noticing Kerry-Anne.* "Kerry-?"

Kerry-Anne: "Run!"

Luna: *She looked awkward and started to run after Kerry-Anne.* "Where's Kylie-?"

Kerry-Anne: *She started to cry, causing Luna to stop her questions.* "The dickhead, he just ripped it off."

Luna: "Ripped wat off?"

Kerry-Anne: "Garharharh." *She cried and raised the bottle, trying not to spill any alcohol.*

Luna: "Kerry-Anne?!"

Kerry-Anne: "It-, it-, it-" *She looked behind her and grunted in fear, trying to find the creature.* "I-I can't see it."

Luna: "It?" *She spoke on her breath and started to inhale deeply, looking at Kerry-Anne in confusion.*

Kerry-Anne: "Behind-" *She slurred in fear and continued to run, keeping a fixated stare behind her.*

Luna: "Behind-?" *She looked over her shoulder and stepped off a small hill, accidentally falling on top of a woman in warrior-like armour.* "Gah-"

?????: "Argh?!" *She stumbled back from Luna and fell to the side, causing a girl with pink hair to look shocked.*

Pink Haired Woman: "Sister?" *She reached over her shoulder, holding onto a large wooden bow with was tied to her back armour.*

?????: "Grr." *She gritted her teeth and angrily stood up, glaring at Luna.* "How dare you!"

Luna: "Gah-" *She slowly stood up, glaring at the woman with yellow hair.* "My bad-"

?????: "No!" *She gritted her teeth, flicking her yellow hair out of her face.*

Luna: "Pssht, settle down, bitch."

Pink Haired Woman: "How dare you talk to her like that! I'm number forty-"

?????: "Wendy, enough."

Wendy: *She swayed her pink hair, looking at the yellow haired woman in confusion.* "Cindy?"

Cindy: "I know I'm only a vice captain, but I've been practising Rostical."

Luna: "Rostickal?" *She spoke in disgust, as if she didn't care what she had to say.*

Kerry-Anne: "Wha-?!" *She tumbled off the small hill, landing face-first into the ground.*

?????: "What an idiot." *A woman with short green hair with a large green wooden mallet tied to her back walked down the road path.*

Luna: *She glared at the woman with green hair and rolled her eyes, focusing her attention to Kerry-Anne.* "You OK-?"

Kerry-Anne: "Gah?" *She sighed on her breath and closed her eyes, falling unconscious.*

Luna: (She just passed out-)

Wendy: *She looked at the woman with short green hair and sighed.* "Mindy, late as always."

Mindy: "What have you got here?"

Luna: "I dunno. I'm lookin' at three stupid bitches that need to back off, aye."

Cindy: "Talk to me or my sisters like that again, and I'll blast you in the face with Rostical!"

Luna: "Aha! Sure, why not?"

Mindy: "Cindy, you're not meant to use Rostical unless you're captain level."

Cindy: "I know.. But, who's going to tell on me?"

*Wendy and Mindy looked at each other with grins, as if they wouldn't tell.*

Luna: "If you're finished ya stupid Rostickal shit, can you fuck off please?"

Cindy: *She ground her teeth and stormed up to Luna, forming a fist.* "I haven't unlocked my potential yet-"

Luna: *She faced Cindy and readied to fight.* "I deal with stereotypical bitches like you all the time-"

Cindy: *She tightened her fist, causing a spark of electricity to flash around her knuckles.* "You asked for it!"

Luna: "Wat was that light?" *She looked to the side, as if she didn't know it came from Cindy's fist.*

Cindy: "Hah!" *She punched towards Luna's face and a swirl of fire shot her in the eyes, causing her to scream in pain.*

Luna: "Gah-?!" *She stumbled back and fell onto her back, covering her eyes in pain.*

Cindy: "Tssk-" *She frowned and shook her wrist, as if she was in pain.*

Mindy: "Cindy?"

Cindy: "I'm okay-"

Wendy: "The Rasticplash?"

Cindy: "Yeah."

Luna: "What the fuck was that?! Argh!" *She yelped in pain, crying out tears of blood and puss.*

Cindy: "Bind her mouth to shut her up and let's take her back to Sorrowprax."

Wendy and Mindy: "Yes!"

----------

*Rachael and Twortz continued to walk across large empty meadows, watching gentle waves crash on a sandy beach to their side.*

Rachael: *She looked down, staring at bright green grass before focusing her attention to the golden sand on the shore.* "The beach looks awesome, hey?"

Twortz: "Indeed it does." *She spoke in a professional-like manner, keeping her attention ahead.*

Rachael: (She didn't even look-..) *She sighed to herself, as if she was bored.* "So.."

Twortz: "Could I ask you a question?"

Rachael: "Shoot?"

Twortz: "Don't take offence to this, but were you always this hyperactive?"

Rachael: "Hyperactive?"

Twortz: "Always, upbeat?"

Rachael: "I've always had a lot of energy. Working two jobs and doing my Hapkido, it usually keeps me busy."

Twortz: "I see."

Rachael: "Besides, just because you say, don't take offence, doesn't mean what you're saying is any less offensive."

Twortz: "Oh? My apologies."

Rachael: "Hehe, I wasn't offended, but I'm just saying."

Twortz: *She noticed smoke rise from tall thin chimneys of a distant town, causing her to smile.* "Finally, civilisation!"

Rachael: "Awesome." *She smiled in determination and unintentionally walked faster.*

Twortz: "I'm famished." *Her stomach growled, catching Rachael's attention.*

Rachael: *She placed her hand on her stomach and looked curious.* (When I woke up, I was starving too.. But now, I'm not.. Like, at all?)

Twortz: *She noticed a bright brown road-like path, causing her to look happy.* (I was a little worried we would be stuck in the middle of nowhere for a while-) "Rachael?"

Rachael: "Ah?" *She snapped out of her train of thought and nodded her head with a smile.*

Twortz: "Looks like, if we follow this road, it'll lead directly to that city."

Rachael: "What are we seriously waiting for?"

Twortz: "My extra cargo?"

Rachael: "Extra-?" *She awkwardly paused on the word, as if she realised what Twortz meant.* "Hehe, alright."

?????: "Oh, fish-cakes! This isn't good." *A man wailed in a sarcastic-like manner, instantly catching Twortz's attention.*

Twortz: (Well, he sounds gay-)

?????: *He shook his bottom to each side, sighing in a defeated-like manner.* "What horrible timing."

Rachael: *She stared at the man's back, noticing he stood on the side of the road-like path.* "Hey?"

Twortz: "Don't go up to him-"

Rachael: *She ignored Twortz and walked further down the path, catching the man's attention.* "What's up?"

?????: *He turned around and noticed Rachael, causing him to step back with uncertainty.* "How can I deliciously help you?"

Rachael: "Deliciously-?"

Twortz: "Help us? She's essentially offering her help." *She spoke in a professional-like manner, stopping next to Rachael.*

?????: "Oh, jinkies! I might take you up on that offer." *He giggled with boosted morale, causing Twortz to sigh, as if she didn't want to be there.*

Rachael: "Well, I'm Rachael, what's up?"

?????: "You speak with such confidence. My name is Lezard." *He smiled and looked at Twortz.*

Twortz: "..."

Lezard: "And..."

Rachael: "Ah? That's Twortz."

Lezard: "Deliciously fascinating names."

Twortz: (Is he drunk? What's with the crazy persona?)

Lezard: "I have a problem."

Rachael: "Well?" *She waved her hand, implying Lezard to continue.*

Twortz: (She really is like Ashton.. Always a need to help. I like that, but.. It's.. Not the Rachael I know-)

Lezard: "Well, I'm on walkies with my daddy and-"

Twortz: "Okay, seriously. Walkies? With your daddy? Is that how a grown man should speak?" *She spoke in a stern voice, keeping her professional composure.*

Rachael: *She silently glanced at Twortz.* (Twortz is very stern and intimidating at first. She used to act in a similar manner like that towards me-)

Lezard: "Ouchies." *He pouted, causing Twortz to shake her head in an annoyed-like manner.*

Twortz: *She stepped to the side, as if she was about to leave.* "I have no time for-"

Lezard: "Okies. My sincere apologies."

Twortz: "..."

Rachael: "So, you're travelling with your father?" *She spoke with uncertainty.*

Lezard: "Bingo!" *He stamped forward and pointed at Rachael in the face, as if she was correct.*

Twortz: "No." *She walked past Rachael, focusing her attention to the city.*

Rachael: "Twortz-" *She grabbed Twortz's arm.*

Twortz: "Yes?" *She spoke in an annoyed-like manner, pulling her arm out of Rachael's grip.*

Rachael: *She quickly glanced at Lezard in desperation.* "Do you know your way around here?"

Lezard: "Of course! I'm a traveller!"

Rachael: *She looked back at Twortz and smirked.* "Well, if we help you out, could you help us find a way home?"

Twortz: "Or, instead of hanging out with freakshow over here, I could just find the local phone in the city?" *She grunted on her breath, ensuring Lezard couldn't hear her.*

Rachael: "Well, I won't stop you." *She shrugged her shoulders and focused her attention back to Lezard.* "So, about you father?"

Lezard: "Well, we're heading to a particular city, and he must've left without me."

Rachael: "Why?"

Lezard: "Well, I kind of lost our RPG bag."

Rachael: "An RPG bag? You mean gun?"

Lezard: "Gun? Sounds like fun." *He giggled in an oblivious-like manner.*

Rachael: "You know, shoot shoot?" *She motioned her hands, as if she shot a gun.*

Lezard: "Nope."

Rachael: *She looked to her side, noticing Twortz enter the city.* (Well, hope my intuition doesn't fail me now.)

Lezard: "Well, that's not what the problem is."

Rachael: "Yeah?"

Lezard: "The problem is-" *He quickly looked to the side, scanning the area in the distance.* "I heard there was a nasty bugger somewhere out there, and I don't know any offensive techniques."

Rachael: "A nasty bugger? Like a bully? And what do you mean techniques?"

Lezard: "Hermm? I don't know about you, but it feels like we're on opposite wave lengths today, bwarharh."

Rachael: "Hehe." *She unintentionally chuckled at Lezard's crazy cackle-like laugh.*

Lezard: "I don't know how else to explain myself."

Rachael: "So, to sum it up. You need to get back to your dad, but don't want to travel alone because of this bully."

Lezard: "Holy fish-cakes, pretty much!"

Rachael: "Maybe you should've just said that in the first place."

Lezard: *He smiled at Rachael, causing her to look insecure.* "..."

Rachael: "What is it?"

Lezard: "I know we just met, but I have a good feeling about you."

Rachael: "Just in case. I'm already taken."

Lezard: "Naww, it won't stop me from trying-"

Rachael: "No, seriously."

Lezard: "And stopped I have." *He coughed, as if he knew Rachael wasn't kidding around.*

*Luna slowly woke up with no vision and felt the ground around her with a dropping jaw.*

Luna: "W-Where-?" *She spoke on her breath, listening to moving chains and distant shouts of agonsiing pain.* "A-Am-...?"

?????: "Looks like one of you finally woke up."

Luna: "Gah-?!" *She screamed in fright and quickly squirmed away from the man's voice, hitting the back of her head on metallic poles.* (What are these-?)

*Luna reached behind her, feeling the poles in confusion.*

Luna: (They feel like bars to a cage-)

?????: "Don't scream, you'll just bring unwanted attention."

Luna: "C-Come near me and I'll call the police!"

?????: "Police?"

Luna: "D-Don't play dumb." *She shivered in terror, as she blindly looked to each side.*

?????: "Even if I wanted to, I'm in a bind." *He moved his arms, causing thick chains to rattle from his wrists and ankles.* "I'm a prisoner too."

Luna: "P-Prisoner?!"

?????: "You were captured by a warrior right?"

Luna: "Warrior?" *She frowned in frustration, suddenly triggering a flashback of Cindy punching her with a fist of flames.*

?????: "They finally caught me.."

Luna: "W-Who..?" *She trembled in fear, as if she didn't know what was happening.* (Am I dreamin'? I-I can wake up now-)

?????: "What happened to your face? Those wounds look fresh."

Luna: "... W-Wake up, Luna."

?????: "Luna?"

Luna: *She whimpered and started to tear up, causing blood to seep from her eyes.* "Why can't I see?"

?????: *He gritted his teeth and tried to pull his arms, causing the chains to dig into his wrists.* (Damn!)

Kerry-Anne: "G-Gah-?!" *She screamed into consciousness, instantly noticing the area around her.* "W-Why are we in a prison cell?"

Luna: "K-Kerry?!"

Kerry-Anne: "Luna?!" *She ignored the black make-up which was smeared across Luna's cheek and neck and eagerly crawled towards her.* "Kylie! She-She died from a creature!"

Luna: "A creature?!"

Kerry-Anne: "It looked like a weed and its eye opened up with teeth?!"

Luna: *She looked in the direction of Kerry-Anne's voice, revealing her damaged eyes.* "Teeth?"

Kerry-Anne: *She silently covered her mouth in disgust, staring at Luna's eyes with a dropping jaw.* "Y-Your eyes."

?????: "Sounds like your friend got attacked by a Scoldrant."

Luna and Kerry-Anne: "Scoldrant?"

?????: *He chuckled, as if he couldn't believe their confusion.* "You're kidding me, right?"

Luna: "Who'd be jokin' around with something like that, dipshit!" *She screamed in anger, causing the man to look intrigued.*

?????: "You aren't so stereotypical?"

Luna: *She started to frown.* "Shut the hell up, aye."

Kerry-Anne: "I can't.. I can't do this.." *She looked at her fingers, noticing dried blood and dirt.* "Where the fuck are we?"

?????: "Wow, language."

Kerry-Anne: "Who the hell are you anyways?"

?????: "Nathan.." *He spoke in disrespect and looked away, as if he didn't care for Kerry-Anne.*

Kerry-Anne: "So, where are we?" *She looked up, staring at a mouldy ceiling.* "What kind of police station has no lights?"

Nathan: "I don't know what you're talking about. We're in Sorrowprax, in an underground facility." *He listened to grunts and moans from other people in singular jail-like cells.*

Kerry-Anne: "Why are we here? We didn't do anything wrong, aye!"

Nathan: "..." *He looked towards the bars, as if he was listening to something.* (More warriors are coming-)

Luna: "D-Don't ignore her!" *She screamed, catching Nathan's attention.*

Nathan: "It's obvious you girls got Neurons in the brain."

Luna: "Wat a lame assed payout."

*Two warriors walked down thick stone stairs and into a massive underground facility, glancing to each side at the cells.*

Prisoner: *He grabbed the bars in each hand, splitting at the ground towards the passing warriors.* "You scum!"

*The warriors with the numbers twenty-two and twenty-three stopped in response.*

Twenty-Two: "What did you say?" *He raised his arm, grabbing hold of a sword's handle which poked over his shoulder.*

Prisoner: "N-Nothing." *He grunted and stepped back, as if he was afraid of the warrior.*

Twenty-Three: *He stared at the prisoner, watching him cower over a large rock which acted as a seat.* (I agree, most of these people are bad-)

Twenty-Two: "Twenty-Three." *He looked at the slightly chubby faced man, as if he was waiting for him to move.*

Twenty-Three: (But what I've witnessed.. There are innocent people-)

Twenty-Two: "Twenty-Three?"

Twenty-Three: (Justice.. Are we doing it right-?)

Twenty-Two: "Trevour!" *He grunted in a frustrated-like manner, catching Trevour's attention.*

Twenty-Three: "Sorry, boss." *He snapped out of his train of thought and continued to walk forward.*

Twenty-Two: "We're here to interrogate two suspects that wear unusual garments."

Twenty-Three: "Ah, the same people the triplets brought back?"

Twenty-Two: "Yes."

Twenty-Three: "What did they actually do?"

Twenty-Two: "Not that it's any of your business, but apparently they assaulted Cindy."

Twenty-Three: "How temperamental."

Kerry-Anne: "Why have you gone all quiet?!" *She grunted at Nathan with distrusting eyes.*

Nathan: "Shh." *He listened to the approaching warrior's armour.*

Twenty-Two: *He stepped into Kerry-Anne and Nathan's sight.*

Twenty-Three: "What one should we take, boss?"

Twenty-Two: "Herm?" *He closely inspected Kerry-Anne and Luna, ignoring Nathan chained up to the wall.*

Luna: (My eyes... I can't see anything, not even darkness..?) *She waved her hands in front of her face, shaking her head in failure.*

Twenty-Two: *He looked at Luna in disgust, causing him to focus on Kerry-Anne.* "Take that one for interrogation." *He pointed at Kerry-Anne, causing Trevour to step forward.*

Twenty-Three: "Roger." *He took a step forward, observing the bars.*

Twenty-Two: (If everything goes well.. I'm only two seats away from being promoted to vice-captain level!)

Twenty-Three: (These are always tricky. You can't by shy with the amount of Neurons you output and you can't be too generous either-) *He placed his hand on a lock with glyphic symbols engraved on it and focused, causing the bars to suddenly open.*

Luna: "Gah-" *She collapsed to the side, as the bars overlapped past her.*

Kerry-Anne: *She stood up, frowning at Trevour as he stepped into the cell.* "What do you want?!"

Twenty-Three: "We will be asking you a few questions, madam."

Kerry-Anne: "Madam? What the-?"

Twenty-Three: *He jumped towards Kerry-Anne and placed his hand on her shoulder, causing her entire body to go limp.* "There-"

Kerry-Anne: "What have you done to me?! Why can't I move?!"

Twenty-Three: "You don't have any Neurons or Astragons, so I touched you with a concentrated blast of Neurons, overloading your body-"

Thirty-Three: "This isn't battle academics! Just take her to the interrogation centre!"

Twenty-Three: *He looked over his shoulder, nodding his head at the warrior.* "R-Right, boss!"

Kerry-Anne: "No! Leave me alone!"

Luna: *She shivered, frozen in fear.* (I don't know what's happenin'. I can't see anything.. I..)

Nathan: "..."

Thirty-Three: "Don't worry, Nathan. We still haven't extracted enough information from you." *He implied he would be back shortly.*

Nathan: "As I keep telling you. I'll never expose the Scoldrant Users."

Thirty-Three: "You have been tough to break, so-" *He grunted with a widening smirk.* "The Consultants have boosted the extremity your sessions."

Nathan: "Boosted the extremity?"

Thirty-Three: "It will be a captain asking you the questions this time."

Nathan: *He grunted with widening eyes.* (A captain?!)

Twenty-Three: "There we go, madam." *He stepped next to Thirty-Three and placed his hand on the lock, causing the cell to close behind him.*

Thirty-Three: "See you shortly." *He spoke with a confident smirk and started to walk away, causing Trevour to closely follow him.*

Kerry-Anne: "Let me go!" *She tried to bite into Trevour's arm, causing her teeth to scrape against his armour.*

Twenty-Three: "Please stop struggling, madam-"

Kerry-Anne: "Go fuck yourself, Rusty!"

Luna: "K-Kerry-Anne?!"

Kerry-Anne: "Help!-"

Thirty-Three: "Shut her up."

Twenty-Three: "Please forgive me, madam." *He quickly covered his hand over her mouth, effectively masking her screams for help.*

Luna: *She crawled into the corner of the cell, listening to Kerry-Anne's fading mumbles.* (Wake up already!)

Chapter 3: Sorrowprax

*Twortz walked into the city and listened to her footsteps change in tone, as she waddled on a smooth clay-like cemented ground.*

Twortz: "Huh?"

*Twortz stopped and noticed the city's houses and structures were the same texture as the ground.*

Twortz: (These towers.. Are we in London? Is that why we can't recognise any of these landmarks?)

*Twortz continued to walk further into the city, noticing unusual glowing spheres on some walls.*

Twortz: (What kind of lights are those-?) *She stepped into a small courtyard with an artistic water fountain and noticed people, failing to notice their strange old fashioned clothing.*

*Twortz sighed to herself in relief and quickly walked up to a nearby woman.*

Twortz: "Why hello."

Woman: *She turned around and noticed Twortz's professional appearance, causing her to smile.* "Hello."

Twortz: "May I please ask you a few questions?"

Woman: "Of course."

Twortz: "Do you know where I am?"

Woman: "Pardon me?" *She sounded unsure, as if she questioned Twortz's mentality.*

Twortz: (My question has seemed to have startled her?) *She coughed, placing her hands behind her back.* "I'm not from around here, you see."

Woman: "Oh." *She spoke in understanding.* "Well, this is The Sanctuary."

Twortz: "The Sanctuary?"

Woman: "It's a city highly protected, so people usually come here for refuge."

Twortz: "Refuge from who exactly?"

Woman: "Scoldrants, natural disasters, or just to escape from Backwater Villages."

Twortz: "..." *She stared at the woman with a blank facial expression and shook her head, as if she didn't know how to respond.* ".. Who protects the city?"

Woman: "The warriors and Consultants of course." *She spoke with a smile, as if Twortz was silly.* "Your protection is guaranteed, all for just a small tax fee."

Twortz: (I've never heard of these warriors before? Is it just her way of saying police?) "Ahem. There aren't many people outside the city. You'd think there would be more people."

Woman: "That's because of the growing aggression of Scoldrants."

Twortz: "Scoldrants?"

Woman: "Are you okay?"

Twortz: "Why, yes?"

Woman: "No matter where you're from. Everyone knows what a Scoldrant is."

Twortz: "Hmm, enlighten me?"

Woman: *She shook her head and stepped to the side, pointing at a large tower in the middle of the city.* "You might want to look through some of the Rosterology databases."

Twortz: "Rost-erol, what sorry?"

Woman: *She ignored Twortz, continuing to point at the tower.* "You might find the answers to your questions there."

Twortz: ".. Much appreciated. Thank you." *She smiled and started to walk towards the tower.*

Woman: "Of course."

Twortz: "Wait-" *She quickly turned around, looking at the woman.* "Do you know where the closest payphone is?"

Woman: "Pay.. Fone?"

Twortz: "What about a mobile?"

Woman: "Mobial? Is that the name for a Rostical or Azure Burst?"

Twortz: "Err.. Never mind." *She fake smiled and turned back around.* (What on Earth is happening here?)

----------

*Rachael and Lezard slowly walked down the road-like path, as if they were waiting for Twortz.*

Rachael: "How come you're travelling with you dad? Is it a vacation of some sort?"

Lezard: "Bwarharh, no no. We're searching for my mother."

Rachael: "Oh?" *She sounded surprised, as if she wasn't expecting that answer.*

Lezard: "Every time we get close to finding her location, she'll move away."

Rachael: "So she doesn't want to be found?"

Lezard: "Not exactly.. It's hard to explain."

Rachael: "Fairo."

Lezard: "What about you? What's your life story?"

Rachael: "Hehe. I was celebrating Sceldrant's Comet and I suddenly passed out." *She shrugged her shoulders.* "Then I woke up in who knows where?"

Lezard: "Hmm? It definitely sounds like something happened."

Rachael: "So, what is this place called? What's the closest city?"

Lezard: "The closest city? Well, you got The Sanctuary over there." *He nudged his head towards the city Twortz entered.*

Rachael: "I'm so confused." *She face palmed at her lack of knowledge.* (I hope you call for help in there, Twortz.)

Lezard: "Now, now. Don't get all flustered. Just ask away, okies?"

Rachael: (Okies?) "Uhm, okay. Start with, why are you wearing such strange clothes?"

----------

*Kerry-Anne was chained up in the middle of a darkroom, standing under an eerie light which glowed in from the outside.*

Kerry-Anne: "What am I doing here?"

*Thirty-Three and Three stood side by side, observing Kerry-Anne from within the darkness.*

Kerry-Anne: "Hello?" *She rattled the chains around her arms and looked up, squinting her eyes at the light above her.*

?????: "Shhh, people can hear you from outside." *A woman spoke from the darkness, as her footsteps echoed into the room.*

Kerry-Anne: "W-Who's there?"

?????: "Not that it matters."

Kerry-Anne: "Untie me, you freaky bastard."

?????: "Fufufu, I'm a member of The Black Brigade, I'm no bastard."

Kerry-Anne: "The Black what? This is kidnappin'! Let me go!"

?????: "Fufufu." *A woman dressed in tight red and black leather with a long ponytail stepped into the light.* "I will ask, and you will answer?"

Kerry-Anne: "Piss off, bitch."

?????: *She smirked and placed one hand on her waist.* "Where are you from?"

Kerry-Anne: "..."

?????: *She noticed Kerry-Anne twitch in fear, causing her to chuckle in understanding.* "If you answer my questions, I'll let you go."

Twenty-Three: (Not many people know, but that's Tara. A member of The Black Brigade, second in charge-)

Kerry-Anne: "..."

Tara: "I promise?" *She smirked, flicking her ponytail over her shoulder.*

Kerry-Anne: "I'm from Dee Highs."

Tara: "Dee Highs? Where exactly is that?"

Kerry-Anne: "Are you jokin'?"

Tara: "Do I look like I'm joking?!" *She suddenly screamed with an echo, losing her calm collected attitude.*

Kerry-Anne: *She spoke with growing fear.* "It's a few suburbs away from the city."

Tara: "Is this Dee Highs on this continent or the other?"

Kerry-Anne: "Continent?"

Tara: *She sighed with growing frustration.* "Is it near Surpreon or Silver Wind Island?"

Kerry-Anne: "I-I don't know either of those places."

Tara: "I shouldn't have expected less from someone who assaults a warrior."

Kerry-Anne: "I don't know what you're talkin' about! How on Earth are you so stupid?!"

Tara: "Earf?"

Kerry-Anne: "Are you serious?!"

Tara: *She formed a fist of her waist and swayed her arm up, causing a string of sparks to cut across Kerry-Anne's face.* "Don't you dare raise your voice at me!"

Kerry-Anne: "Argh!" *She screamed in pain and spat out blood, watching it drip off her chin.*

Tara: "Now-" *She flicked her wrist, snapping a whip by her side.*

Kerry-Anne: "W-Where did you get that whip from-?"

Tara: "Where-" *She swayed her arm across, flicking the whip down Kerry-Anne's face.* "Are you from?!"

Kerry-Anne: "Kah-?" *She coughed in shock and closed one eye, as blood poured into it.* "I-I'm from fuckin' Earth?! Are you fucked in the head-?!"

Tara: "Too bad.." *She spoke with an emotionless face, gripping onto the whip's handle in anger.*

Kerry-Anne: "I wanna go home.." *She whimpered on her breath and looked down, watching the blood run off her chin.*

Tara: "Die."

Kerry-Anne: *She suddenly gasped with widening eyes.* "D-Die-?"

Twenty-Three: "I thought this was an interrogation? Why is she being sent to death-?"

Thirty-Three: "Shh." *He angrily covered Trevour's mouth.*

Tara: "I will send you to The Astral Plains."

Kerry-Anne: "Wat the hell is The Astra Planes?"

Tara: "What is The Astral Plains? What's next? You're going to tell me what Rostical is?"

Kerry-Anne: "Rosti-what?" *She spoke with a trembling voice.*

Tara: *She frowned, gritting in teeth in an annoyed-like manner.* "Azure Burst.."

Twenty-Three: (Does she really not know any of this?)

*Tara's body glowed a shade of blue, catching the warrior's attention.*

Thirty-Three: (This is it..) *He smirked in an evil-like manner.*

Tara: "Serpent's Touch." *She stopped her movement and watched the whip slither towards Kerry-Anne, gently touching her on the chest.*

Kerry-Anne: "H-How is your whip moving like that-?"

Tara: *She flicked her wrist, causing the whip to pulse, cracking Kerry-Anne's ribs.* "Hermph."

Kerry-Anne: "A-...?!" *She gasped with a loss of breath, as blood oozed out of her mouth.*

Tara: *She swayed the whip across Kerry-Anne's face, as it gently flicked her hair to the side.* (What little Neurons she had, is now gone.) "Fufufu."

Thirty-Three: "Captain?"

Tara: "Bring me the Scoldrant User! Then I'll have fun with the other one."

Thirty-Three: *He bumped Trevour, implying for him to go get Nathan.* "Now."

Twenty-Three: "Right, boss!" *He turned around and left the room.*

*Trevour stepped in a small puddle and listened to rattling chains echo in the facility.*

Twenty-Three: (Why would that girl in the strange clothes lie about something so tedious? Earf? I don't get it.. She could've lived if she just answered Tara's questions.)

----------

Nathan: *He stared at Luna, watching her silently sit in the corner of the room.* "You're going to die like the rest of us-"

Luna: "Don't you know when nobody gives a shit what you have to say?"

Nathan: *He smirked in a competitive-like manner.* "Whereabouts are you from?"

Luna: "Why do you ask?"

Nathan: "I've never heard your type of accent before."

Luna: "Accent? I got no accent, dipshit."

Nathan: "Okay, I've never heard someone talk like you before."

Luna: "On what planet are you from? 'Cause, it certainly ain't Earth."

Nathan: "Earth?"

Luna: "Aha, you're funny, aye." *She sniffed, trying not to touch her face.*

Twenty-Three: *He rested his back on a stone wall, listening to Luna and Nathan's conversation.* (She said Earf too?)

Nathan: "I'm curious now. Where are you from?"

Luna: ".. Dee Highs?"

Nathan: "I've never heard of that before. Is it a backwater village?"

Luna: "Dee Highs? A village? It's a bloody city."

Nathan: "A city? Is it located around Surpreon?"

Luna: "Espreon? What? No. If you want to play games, find someone else, aye."

Twenty-Three: (The tone in her voice.. She's serious..)

Luna: "Why are you in here?"

Nathan: "Oh, so now you want to talk?"

Luna: "Fine..." *She looked away, symbolising she didn't want to talk.*

Nathan: "..." *He sighed and looked up, noticing infected skin around his wrists from the chains.* "I was trying to stop the warrior's tax."

Luna: "Tax?"

Nathan: "I don't like their version of keeping safe."

Luna: "What do you mean?"

Nathan: "They don't give you an option if you want their protection or not. It's either, pay tax or get destroyed by them." *He spoke with emotion, as if he was recalling a past event.*

Luna: "..."

Nathan: "They somehow found out I was a Scoldrant User-"

Luna: "Wat's a Scoldrant?"

Nathan: *He stared at Luna with a blank face, as if she was playing a joke on him.* "Have you lost your memory?"

Luna: "Aye?" *She looked towards the sound of Nathan's voice in a blind-like manner.*

Nathan: "Where are you really from?"

Luna: "I thought this was a joke.. Or maybe even a dream.." *She whispered on her breath.* "I don't think I'm from around here.."

Nathan: "Huh?"

Luna: "'Bout these Scoldrants?"

Nathan: "They're the creatures your companion was talking about."

Luna: "A creature attacked Kylie?"

Nathan: "Some of the Scoldrants around The Twilight Forest and Swirling Marshes are attracted to blood."

Luna: (Blood?) *Images of Kylie's cut wrists flashed in her mind.*

Nathan: "Some people have the ability to communicate with those creatures. Some even have the ability to connect to a level where they become lifetime partners."

Luna: "Pssht! And wat, do you keep them in little balls and go to gym battles?"

Nathan: "Huh?"

Luna: "Don't worry.."

Nathan: "Scoldrant Users have been hunted like animals. So, they've had no choice but to go in hiding."

Luna: "I'm sorry.. This is too much for me-" *She grunted and curled up into a tighter ball.*

Twenty-Three: *He closed his eyes and rested the back of his head on the stone wall, as if he wasn't sure what to do.* (How is this possible?)

Luna: "I wanna go back to Dee Highs." *She tightly closed her eyes, causing a tear of blood to run down her face.*

Twenty-Three: "..." *He opened his eyes and silently walked across the cell, looking at Nathan.*

Nathan: "So, it's finally my turn?"

Twenty-Three: *He nodded his head, discreetly glancing at Luna.* (If for some reason, they're telling the truth. We have no right to kill or even hurt them..)

Nathan: "What, can't talk, scum?"

Twenty-Three: (I don't blame you for being angry towards us.. I didn't know us warriors, the protectors of people, caused an entire clan to go into hiding-)

Tara: "I'm waiting!" *Her screams echoed in the distance, catching Trevour's attention.*

Twenty-Three: *She shook his head and opened the bars, readying to grab Nathan.* "You will now be asked more questions by a single digit warrior."

Nathan: "If I don't see you.. Good luck finding a way home." *He shouted at Luna, as Trevour pulled him by the chains around his wrists and ankles.*

Luna: "..." *She pretended she was asleep, ignoring Nathan.*

----------

*Twortz walked up white stone stairs and stopped at the tower's entrance, staring at a glyphic-like pattern on its large circular doors.*

Twortz: (How does this open?) *She looked to the side, noticing two men in white robes walk up the stairs.* "Excuse me, but how does one enter this tower?"

Man A: "The tower of sanctuary-" *He looked up, admiring the tower's height.* "You need a pass to enter."

Twortz: "Oh? But I don't have one of these passes. How could I get one?"

Man B: "It would take a while to collect one."

Twortz: "Blast." *She frowned in thought, trying to think of something.* "What would be the quickest way to get in? Your thoughts?"

Man A: "If you're able to use Rostical or have the blood of Astragons and Neurons, you'll be able to enter."

Twortz: "What's so special about these?" *She pretended to know more than she did.*

Man B: "People that can use Rostical are already held in high regard."

Man A: *He nodded his head and started to walk towards the entrance.* "Please excuse my rudeness, but I'm late for my class."

Man B: "M-Me too!" *He smiled and waved at Twortz.* "You can register for a pass at The Library on the other continent!"

Twortz: *She watched the glyphic-like pattern glow to the men's passes, causing the door to spiral open.* "Wow, it spiralled open?" *She spoke in amazement, watching the door spiral back behind the men.*

*Twortz took several steps closer to the door and squinted her eyes, inspecting the patterns around it.*

Twortz: "How fascinating. A town that looks old, yet, has a tower of perfect ingenuity-"

*The glyphs on the door responded to Twortz and started to glow, causing it to spiral open.*

Twortz: *She stepped back, ensuring nobody was walking out.* (Did it respond to me? I don't have one of these passes? Nevertheless, I don't waste an opportunity, I need to find what's happening.)

*Twortz stepped inside and noticed holographic-like lockers along the walls and large test tubes, showing a peculiar animal.*

Twortz: (This looks like a school crossed between and laboratory-)

*Twortz focused her attention to the large test tubes and walked up to them, noticing a golden plate with no writing.*

Twortz: (It's blank-?) *She rubbed the golden plate, attempting to remove any dust.*

*The golden plate shined to her touch, causing a holographic-like screen to display itself on the test tube.*

Twortz: "What is that-?" *A large white stone pillar to her side glowed and activated, responding to her voice.*

Rosterology Pillar: "Scoldrant, specimen, canine-dash, location, Snowfrost Mountains." *An orb on top of the pillar glowed with each word it spoke.*

Twortz: "A-Ah..?" *She stepped away from the pillar, as if she was unsure how to respond.* "Call for help?"

Rosterology Pillar: "No immediate threats located. Four Rostical Users located in-dash facility."

Twortz: *She rubbed her head, frowning in confusion.* "Okay. What is that animal?"

Rosterology Pillar: "Rostical Using Scoldrant. Located-dash, in Snowfrost Mountains."

Twortz: "What is this place?"

Rosterology Pillar: "A facility for teaching the arts of Rostical, Azure Bursts, standard-dash, attacks."

Twortz: "I don't understand any of this? What is happening to me?" *She hissed at herself and bent at the knees, violently grabbing hold of her head.*

Rosterology Pillar: "Scanning.."

*A wave of laser-like lights flashed on Twortz, causing the pillar to make computer-like noises.*

Twortz: "What did you-?"

Rosterology Pillar: "All vitals are clear. Unknown origins, -dash, unknown energy signature, unknown-dash hybrid energy signature."

Twortz: "What-?" *She slowly looked up to the pillar.*

Rosterology Pillar: "A Score User and-dash a Sacred Dancer! Ability has been banned, threat located!-"

*Red lights spiralled on the roof, followed by a loud siren-like noise alerting nearby people.*

Rosterology Pillar: "Threat located, threat located, threat located!"

Twortz: "W-Who? Me?! I'm not a score-"

Rosterology Pillar: "Activating defence-dash protocol-"

Twortz: *She started to run out of the facility, causing the door to spiral open.* (What is going on?!)

----------

*Nathan spat out blood and smirked, staring at Tara in a cocky-like manner.*

Tara: "Wipe that smirk off your face!" *She flicked the whip, wrapping it around Nathan's head.*

Twenty-Three: "What's she doing, boss?" *He leant to one side and whispered to the warrior next to him, while keeping an eye on Nathan.*

Thirty-Three: "I've only seen one other Black Brigade interrogation. Do you know why members of The Black Brigade are usually chosen by the Consultants to do these tasks?"

Twenty-Three: "No, boss. Why?"

Thirty-Three: "It's because of their weapon's ability."

Twenty-Three: "Her whip?"

Thirty-Three: "It's able to absorb the Neurons right out of someone's body."

Twenty-Three: "But, that could damage-"

Thirty-Three: "I know what it could do."

Twenty-Three: *He stared at Nathan, triggering a flashback of his previous conversation with Luna.* (I didn't know we forced tax on villages.. I just.. Didn't know-)

Tara: "Last chance. Where is your tribe?!"

Nathan: "Go to The Astral Plains, you dirty lamp."

Tara: "D-Dirty-?!" *She gasped in disbelief.*

Thirty-Three: *He chuckled in shock.* "How just used the worst swear word to a member of-"

Tara: "Ougi! Multi-Vein Snap."

*The whip violently zigzagged and stabbed into Nathan's neck, causing him to gag in fright.*

Tara: *She licked her lips and smirked.* "Yes, your Neurons taste odd? Like, they're not ripe yet?"

Nathan: *He gritted his teeth with a growing frown, as if he was trying to hide the pain.* (I can't-) "Argh!"

Tara: "Yes, submit!"

Nathan: "M-Make it quick!" *He grunted over the tightening whip around his neck.*

Tara: "Fufufu! Don't get too excited! I've got you for another session-" *She smirked and lowered her arm, causing the whip to become loose.*

Nathan: "Tssk-" *He sighed and became limp, causing the chains to rattle.*

Tara: *She turned around and snapped the whip to her side, causing it to whirl into a ball.* "Fufufu." *She placed the curled whip on her waist, causing it to become invisible.*

Twenty-Three: "..."

Tara: "Dispose of the woman, and send that dirty lamp back into his cell."

Thirty-Three: "Yes, ma'am!"

Twenty-Three: "Yes, madam!"

----------

Rachael: (This feels and sounds like something from a classic fictional story. Either way, sounds like I'm in a different country. It's the only explanation-)

Lezard: "Are you okay?"

Rachael: "Yeah. I can't wrap my head around how different some cultures are. I know I've travelled to different countries before, but-"

*The ground vibrated underneath Rachael's feet, causing her to look down.*

Rachael: "What was that?"

Lezard: "What was what, my new delicious friend?"

Rachael: "I felt something rumble?"

Lezard: "You did?" *He looked down in a curious-like manner.* "I certainly didn't feel anything?"

Rachael: *She felt the ground rumble again, causing her to look at Lezard.* "I felt it again!"

Lezard: *He shook his head, sarcastically pouting his lips in failure.* "I don't feel anything?"

Rachael: "C'mon?"

Lezard: "Honest-, scout's honour." *He giggled and saluted with three fingers, emphasising his honesty.*

Rachael: "It almost feels like footsteps."

Lezard: "I'd hate to see his dinner plate, bwarharh."

Rachael: *She smiled with a loss of concentration, as she continued to focus on the vibrations.* "I wonder-"

Twortz: "Rachael!" *She waddled out of the city and awkwardly ran up the road-like path.*

Lezard: "Bwarharh, I'm not being mean, but were you talking about your friend there?" *He awkwardly pointed at Twortz.*

Rachael: "Lezard-" *She hissed, hiding her smile and faced Twortz.* "What's wrong?!"

Twortz: "S-Something is wrong, there was this pillar and it spoke to me?!"

Rachael: "A pillar spoke to you?"

Lezard: "That sounds about right."

Twortz: "Then there was this monster inside a test tube-"

Lezard: "Probably a Scoldrant-"

Twortz: "Then people were talking about Neurons and Astra something."

Lezard: "Astragons."

Twortz: "And-"

Rachael: "And?"

Twortz: "There's a fifteen foot monster behind you."

Rachael: "A fifteen-? Wait, what?"

Lezard: "Behind-?" *He slowly turned around in suspense, suddenly shaking his bottom in fear.* "How upsetting, everyone.. Run for your lives!"

Rachael: "I-Imposs-" *She gasped with widening eyes, staring at an enormous humanoid rock figure.*

Twortz: *She trembled with buckling knees, frozen in fear.* "W-What.. Wh-What is.. What...?!"

Lezard: "Oh dear! I'm not an offensive fighter!"

*Lezard sarcastically whimpered and hobbled behind Rachael and Twortz, intensely staring at the stone figure.*

Lezard: "It's unusual that a Scoldrant of this size is this close to a city, and out in the open too!-" *He spoke in concern, as if he knew he was in a bad situation.*

Rachael: "S-So that's a Scoldrant?"

Twortz: (I-I'm the oldest.. I'm the most responsible.. It's my responsibility to ensure nothing happens to Rachael.. Even if it's not the real one-) *She shut her eyes, trying to control her fear.*

Scoldrant: "Gnoar!" *Two rocks opened on its face, allowing it to release a deep raspy roar.*

Rachael: "Should we retreat to the city?"

Lezard: (She's a sound thinker-)

Twortz: "We probably won't make it in time." *She spoke with her eyes shut.*

Lezard: "We should try. Rock based Scoldrants are usually slow-"

Scoldrant: *It stepped forward, causing the ground to rumble.* "Gnaor!" *It raised its arm made of large boulders, causing streams of sand to pour from the crevices.*

Rachael: "Whatever it is, it's about to strike!" *She raised her fists and stood in a battle-ready pose.*

Lezard: "Do either of you know any water based Azure Bursts?!"

Twortz: *She opened her eyes and reached over her shoulder, grabbing the frying pan in determination.* "You two, run back to the city."

Lezard: "I squeal over your determination, but you won't be able to even touch that Scoldrant with physical attacks alone."

Scoldrant: "Gnaorrr!" *It punched towards the cluttered group at incredible speeds.*

Lezard: "Wha-?!"

Rachael: *She swayed to the side and watched the massive arm crash into the ground, exploding a dirt pulse around it.* "Eek-"

Scoldrant: "Gnaor!" *It opened its hand in the ground and the dirt pulse pushed Rachael and Lezard back, causing them to tumble onto the ground.*

Twortz: *The pulse blew past her, as if nothing happened.* "Huh?"

Rachael: "Tssk, everyone okay?!" *She gritted her teeth and quickly stood back up, raising her fists.*

Lezard: "Wha-?! It hurts, I think I broke my uterus!" *He squealed in a sarcastic-like manner, holding onto his knee.*

Twortz: *She waddled up to Rachael with a loss of breath, raising the frying pan to her face.* "Are we crazy, or is this a dream?"

Rachael: "Beats me. All I know, is that thing is real."

Twortz: *She ran towards the Scoldrant and raised her arm, screaming with an echoing voice.* "Take this!"

Rachael: (Why did her voice echo like that-?)

Twortz: "Hooee!" *She hit the frying pan on the Scoldrant's arm, causing a loud metallic screech to burst the stone into the air.*

Rachael: "What-?!"

Lezard: "Jinkies! What technique was that-?!"

Twortz: *She wailed in pain and dropped the frying pan, instantly holding onto her wrist in agony.* "It hurts-"

Scoldrant: "Gnrraor!" *It slowly lifted its leg and suddenly kicked Twortz, blasting her across the road-like path.*

Rachael: "Twortz!-"

Lezard: "Holy fish-cakes!-" *He gasped in fright, watching Twortz hit the ground, making awkward spirals in the air.*

Twortz: "Kerrh." *She slid on her side and slowly came to a stop, wheezing in pain.*

Rachael: "Why you!" *She frowned in a protective-like manner and sprinted towards the Scoldrant at an incredible speed.* "Hah!"

*Rachael punched the Scoldrant on the abdomen and listened to her knuckles crack, causing her to scream in pain.*

Rachael: "My fist!-"

Scoldrant: "Gnaor!" *It swept its arm at Rachael, attempting to hit her across the head.*

Rachael: "Tssk-" *She quickly bent back and dropped to the ground, watching the arm sweep over her face, causing her hair to sway to one side.*

Lezard: "You can do it, little monster!" *He waved his arm, trying to boost Rachael's morale.*

Rachael: *She jumped back up and spun around, kicking the Scoldrant on its side.* "Argh!" (It feels like I'm just hitting the ground-)

*Rachael quickly back flipped away from the Scoldrant, avoiding a sweeping kick.*

Lezard: *He noticed her skirt sway in the breeze, revealing her tight gym-like shorts underneath.* "Not looking." *He squealed and looked away, quickly wiping his sudden nose bleed.*

Rachael: *She landed on her feet and frowned at the Scoldrant, raising her fists.* (What did Twortz do? I can't even graze the sand off its body-)

*Rachael looked down, noticing the frying pan shimmer in the sunlight.*

Rachael: (The frying pan!) *She shouted in thought and sprinted towards the Scoldrant.*

Lezard: "Let's flee already!-"

Scoldrant: "Gnaor!" *It formed a boulder-like fist and swayed back, punching directly towards Rachael.*

Lezard: "Watch out!"

Rachael: *She leant forward and slid on the ground, grabbing the frying pan along the way.* "Hah!"

Scoldrant: "Gnaor-" *It lunged forward, watching its arm miss Rachael.*

Rachael: *She jumped into striking distance and hit the frying pan on the Scoldrant's chest.* "Ah?"

Lezard: "Nothing?"

Rachael: "It hardly made a noise-"

Scoldrant: *It grabbed Rachael around the waist and lifted her up.* "Gnaor!" *It applied pressure, causing Rachael to drop the frying pan.*

Lezard: "No!"

Twortz: "Tssk." *She gritted her teeth and grunted with a struggle, trying to lift herself off the ground.* (I can't-)

Rachael: (I can't breathe-)

Scoldrant: "Gnaor!" *It swayed to the side and rocked its entire body, throwing Rachael high into the air.*

Lezard: *He looked up, gasping in shock.* (At that height!-) "No! We just became besties!-"

Twortz: "Rachael Taylor!"

Rachael: *She started to descend, causing her to stare at the solid path with widening eyes.* "Ahhh!"

Lezard: "I can't watch!" *He quickly shut his eyes, looking away.*

Rachael: *She screamed in shock, suddenly touching her throat.* (I feel sick!-)

*A rock pillar suddenly erupted out of ground and blasted into the air, smashing into Rachael.*

Rachael: "Kah-?" *She coughed on the rock and started to slowly descend, before violently hitting the ground.*

*The rock pillar underneath Rachael shattered across the ground, catching Lezard's attention.*

Lezard: (She's alive?!) *He thought with a smile.*

Rachael: *She coughed, lying in the middle of a dirt cloud.* "Th-That hurt-"

Twortz: (What did I just witness?! A rock just shot up and hit Rachael, effectively cushioning her fall!)

Scoldrant: "Gnaor!"

Lezard: *He looked to each side, noticing Twortz and Rachael on the ground.* (I don't have any choice but to fight, don't I-?)

*A green snake slithered behind the stone Scoldrant and struck into its shoulder, suddenly wrapping itself around the Scoldrant's body.*

Lezard: "N-Not another one!" *He stood up and quickly hobbled up to Rachael with his head lowered.* "Are you okay, little monster? You were thrown up pretty high-"

Rachael: "Yeah. I'm more hurt from that freak boulder flying up from the ground-"

Scoldrant: "Gnoar!" *It roared, as the snake applied pressure, cracking some of its rocks.*

Twortz: (That's the largest snake I've ever seen in my life!-)

?????: "Finish it, Arthur." *A woman in platinum armour spoke to the snake, as if she was the owner.*

Arthur: *It slithered its head above the Scoldrant and looked down, opening its massive jaw.* "HYDRO CANNONss."

Twortz: (The thing can talk?!)

*The snake spoke with a hiss and a sudden stream of high pressured water blasted into the Scoldrant, exploding it into violent pieces of rock.*

Rachael: "Ah-?" *Splashes of water and rock blew past her, cutting her across the face.*

Arthur: *It relaxed its body, leaving a pile of wet rock where the Scoldrant stood.* "Hssst."

?????: "That's a good boy." *She spoke with a confident smirk and walked towards Rachael, keeping a fixated stare on the city.*

Rachael: *She noticed the woman approach the snake, causing her to gasp in a protective-like manner.* "Watch out! The snake will-"

Lezard: *He quickly covered Rachael's mouth, causing her to squirm in confusion.* "Don't say a word. She's a captain." *He whispered in Rachael's ear.*

Rachael: *She continued to squirm, grabbing onto Lezard's wrist.* "...-"

Lezard: "Trust me-" *He gently lowered his arm, noticing Rachael keeping to herself.*

Rachael: "Who is that? Won't the snake attack her?" *She whispered to Lezard.*

Lezard: (I can't believe I face a captain as soon as I leave you, father monster-)

Rachael: "Hey?" *She looked at Lezard, waiting for his response.*

Lezard: "I fear that could be Nancy."

Rachael: "Nancy?" *She watched the snake suddenly spiral around Nancy, causing her to gasp.* (It is going to attack her-?!)

Lezard: *He watched Arthur slither behind Nancy, as if it was keeping watch on her surroundings.* (Having control of something so powerful.. Frightening.)

Nancy: "Let's see what is such a threat." *She spoke on her breath and stared at the tower in the distance with a widening smirk.*

Arthur: "Hssst." *He swayed his neck and slithered behind Nancy, leaving an S-shaped trail behind him from the previous Scoldrant's remains.*

Nancy: "Yes.." *She glanced at Arthur with a smirk as if she could understand his hisses.* "Sending one of the top three warriors.. Whoever it is, they'll be dead before they even utter a word-"

Twortz: *She looked at Nancy.* "Th-Thank you-"

Nancy: *She paused and instantly glared at Twortz, causing Arthur to hiss for intimidation.* "You dare speak to me?"

Twortz: "I-I-?"

Lezard: "I fear, that's Nancy the feeder."

Rachael: "Why is she called-?"

Nancy: "Are you hungry, Arthur?"

Arthur: "Hsssst." *It slithered its tongue at Twortz as if it was inspecting her.*

Rachael: "Crud." *She spoke in realisation.*

Nancy: *She heard the sounds of a faint siren come from the city, causing her to sigh in an annoyed-like manner.* "No feeding today, Arthur. Work calls."

Arthur: "Tsssskt."

Nancy: *She started to walk towards the city and clicked her fingers, causing Arthur to suddenly disintegrate into a swirl of blue particles.* "Bwohohoho."

*Nancy laughed to herself and played with a small blue orb in her hand as if it was a baseball.*

Nancy: "Let's see what this threat is all about.." *She licked her lips and walked into the city.*

Twortz: "..." *She stared into space with a petrified look on her face.*

Lezard: "Little monster?" *He stood up and pulled Rachael's arm up, helping her to her feet.*

Rachael: "What.. Just happened?"

Lezard: (These poor girls are traumatised.. It's almost like it's their first Scoldrant encounter-)

Rachael: "Harh..?" *She whimpered, covering her mouth with watering eyes.*

Lezard: *He stepped back, startled by Rachael's sudden sadness.* "I-It's okay?" *He spoke in a serious-like manner, hugging her for comfort.*

Twortz: *She awkwardly stood up and wheezed, collapsing back to her knees.* (My ribs? I can feel it touching my lungs!) *She purposely took short, quick breaths.*

Rachael: "Ash, where are you?!" *She started to cry in Lezard's arms.* "Where are you, Ashton?!"

----------

*Trevour stood behind Thirty-Three and Tara, listening to their conversation.*

Tara: "I will try to extract information from the Scoldrant User one last time before killing him."

Twenty-Three: (What-?)

Thirty-Three: "Excellent."

Twenty-Three: (Excellent?!)

Thirty-Three: "What about the other prisoner?"

Tara: "I will use my Ougi against her and demand information before she runs out of her life Neurons."

Thirty-Three: "Understood. Twenty-Three, go fetch our prisoners immediately."

Twenty-Three: "Yes.." *He turned around and started to walk out, causing Thirty-Three to grunt.*

Thirty-Three: "No boss today?"

Twenty-Three: "..." *He continued to walk out.*

Tara: "You say you wanted to become a vice-captain one day?"

Thirty-Three: "Yes!" *He spoke with enthusiasm, quickly looking at Tara.*

Tara: *She smirked evil-like.* "In an interrogation, never have the person ask you questions. It shows weakness."

Thirty-Three: "Got it!"

----------

Nathan: "Errr?" *He groaned into consciousness, finding himself chained back in his cell.* "Where-?"

Luna: *She slowly looked into Nathan's general direction.* "It was Nathan, right?"

Nathan: "Nathan? Who's that?"

Luna: "So, I finally talk to you and you're a stupid idiot."

Nathan: "Whoa, calm down!" *He frowned.* "I don't even know where I am!"

Luna: "You said we're in some sorrow wateva?"

Nathan: "Sorrowprax?" *He looked up, sounding confused.*

Luna: "Wateva-"

Twenty-Three: "Don't mind him, madam."

Luna: "Aye? W-Who's there?"

Twenty-Three: "He's suffering from temporary Neuron damage."

Luna: "What?"

Twenty-Three: "Memory loss."

Nathan: "Don't talk like I'm not even here."

Luna: "You here to take me?" *She spoke with low morale, as if she knew the experience would be bad.*

Twenty-Three: *He looked down, staring at his armour.* "Yes.."

Luna: *She closed her eyes, trying not to cry.* "What did I do to deserve this? I just want to go home."

Twenty-Three: "..." *He formed fists and stepped forward, placing his hand on the lock.*

Luna: "I want to take a bath, watch a movie.. Eat junk food-" *She listened to the cell doors slide open, causing her to whimper.*

Nathan: "..." *He watched Trevour step into the cell in a hazy-like manner.*

Twenty-Three: "Where are you really from?"

Luna: "..."

Twenty-Three: "Madam?"

Luna: "Aye?" *She looked up as if she didn't know Trevour was talking to her.*

Twenty-Three: "Where are you really from?"

Luna: "Gah, from Earth! How can you-?"

Twenty-Three: "My superiors will be continuing their interrogation."

Nathan: "Great..." *He spoke as if he didn't care.*

Twenty-Three: "But I'm afraid the situation is a little more temperamental than that.. You will be sentenced to death like your friend."

Luna: (K-Kerry.. Anne?)

Nathan: *He grunted with widening eyes.* (No.. I can't.. I can't!-) "No! Don't you warriors have any sense of respect?!"

Twenty-Three: "Please relax yourself, sir. I happen to agree with your point of view."

Luna: "Aye?"

Nathan: "Huh?"

Twenty-Three: *He looked down, sighing with emotion.* "We need to leave. I'm not a person that goes against rules, but I can't stand by and watch innocent people get killed."

Luna: "..." *She smirked with hope and silently scanned across the room in a blind-like manner.*

Nathan: "But, how? Not many people have broken out of Sorrowprax."

Luna: "It wouldn't be that hard."

Twenty-Three: "On the contrary. It took the Consultant's second strongest number one warrior to break out of the walls."

Luna: "Number, wat?"

Twenty-Three: "It's too temperamental to explain right now."

Nathan: "So, top shot. What's your plan?" *He spoke with low morale, as if he wasn't expecting any results."

Twenty-Three: "It may be forbidden to use Rostical out of the single digits.. But, I was born with the ability."

Luna: "Rostickal?"

Nathan: *He silently stared at Trevour and looked at him from top to bottom, as if he was judging his appearance.* (I don't judge people on their title, but, I'm meant to believe he knows how to use Rostical-?)

Twenty-Three: *He hobbled up to Nathan and touched the chains around his wrists, causing them to suddenly pop open.* "These are Neuron specific chains."

Nathan: "What does that mean?"

Twenty-Three: *He bent down and touched the chains on Nathan's ankles, causing them to pop open.* "They respond to a certain type of Neurons. This allows certain warriors to be held accountable for any mix-ups."

Nathan: "Why are you doing this?" *He grunted in a cautious-like manner, rubbing his wrists with discomfort.*

Twenty-Three: "You need to question my good will, sir?"

Nathan: "So.." *He glanced across the cell, implying how he was going to get out.*

Twenty-Three: *He glanced at Luna, looking at her eyes in thought.* "Sir?"

Nathan: "What?" *He continued to rub his wrists in discomfort.*

Twenty-Three: "May you please guide this lady-..?" *He purposely prolonged the last word, as if he wanted to know her name.*

Luna: "Luna."

Twenty-Three: "Heh heh." *He awkwardly chuckled and walked up to the stone wall, placing his hand on it.* "Sorry, madam."

Luna: "Madam?"

Twenty-Three: "I mean, Luna."

Luna: "Pssht." *She shook her head, as if she wasn't used to Trevour's type of personality.*

Nathan: *He awkwardly grabbed Luna's arm and lifted her up, focusing his attention to Trevour.* "I got her. What now?"

Luna: "Man, you stink."

Nathan: *He frowned in response.* "You aren't smelling like daisies yourself."

Luna: "Pssht." *She blindly looked away with a frown.*

Twenty-Three: *He closed his eyes and focused, causing a brown glyph to zigzag and spiral underneath him.* (I need to charge my Neurons and focus my Astragons-)

Nathan: *He instantly gazed at the forming glyph under Trevour and watched the last line connect, causing itself to glow.* (Rostical!)

Luna: "Wat's that sound?"

Nathan: "It's the Rostical's glyph."

Luna: "..."

Twenty-Three: (My biggest worries is the massive Purity Zone. If they find out almost immediately about our escape and send out a captain ranking warrior... We'll be... Oh, gee. What a temperamental situation that would be.)

Luna: "What's happening? Why did it suddenly get warm in here?"

Nathan: "Warm? It's still cold."

Luna: "Maybe your stench is repelling the heat?"

Nathan: "Man, you're moody-"

Twenty-Three: "SWIRLING SANDPIT" *He shouted with an echoing voice and pushed forward, causing sand to violently spiral around his hand.*

Luna: "Wat's happenin'? What's that grainy sound-?"

Twenty-Three: *He pushed his entire arm into the wall, causing sunlight to shine on his face.* "Excellent. With a sturdy push, I was able to do it."

Nathan: (Despite this, his Rostical-) *He walked towards the tunnel Trevour made with gritted teeth.* (I still hate it.)

Luna: *She walked past Trevour and felt a draft.* "I swear, that wind is warm, aye?"

Twenty-Three: *He stared at Nathan and Luna's back, watching them walk through the tunnel.* (I hope nobody picked up on my Neuron signature.)

Luna: "And why did your voice echo-?" *She noticed her voice echo in the tunnel, causing her to become silent in a satisfied-like manner.*

Nathan: (I can't believe we're escaping Sorrowprax.. But, when did I get captured?)

Twenty-Three: (I hope we can make as much distance as possible before our departure has been noticed.) *He thought in a worried-like manner and hobbled after Nathan and Luna, causing a wall of sand to close up behind him.*

----------

*Tara and Thirty-Three stood outside the empty cell, staring at sand all over the ground in shock.*

Tara: "This..." *She hissed with surprise and anger.*

Thirty-Three: "I can't-..." (Trevour, you stupid dirty lamp.)

Tara: "I will report this to the Consultant immediately!"

Thirty-Three: (Trevour will get terminated-) "I will tell the Consultant-"

Tara: "Oh you will?" *She suddenly appeared behind Thirty-Three and grabbed his head with both hands.*

Thirty-Three: "What are you-?"

Tara: *She twisted to the side, violently snapping his neck.* "I interrogate people. Don't take me for a fool."

*Tara threw Thirty-Three to the side and ignored the growing shouts which were attracted to her sudden action.*

Tara: "You scum, be quiet!" *She screamed, causing the nearby prisoners to stop, filling the air with silence.* "Now I have to tell the Consultant what-.."

*Tara hissed under her breath and stepped forward, flashstepping out the facility, leaving a faint buzz-like noise behind her.*

----------

*Kath sat in a poorly lit room, sitting on a stool-like chair, listening to the sounds of quiet typing in the background.*

Kath: "Hermm?" *She pushed her glasses up with one finger and looked to the side, staring at a warrior typing.* "I just felt a Neuron signature down below."

Warrior: "There has been no alerts, ma'am."

Kath: "Do a detailed scan immediately."

Warrior: "Are you sure?"

Kath: "Why don't I see the scanner on the screen?" *She spoke with a stern voice and stared at the computer-like screen in front of the warrior.*

Warrior: "S-Scanning now!" *She spoke with a trembling voice, quickly typing on a long keyboard-like device.*

----------

*Trevour, Luna and Nathan all stepped outside, taking a deep breath of fresh air.*

Nathan: "Man, that feels great."

Luna: "Feels great, still stinks." *She glared in Nathan's general direction.*

Nathan: "Probably the air blowing your stench back in your face."

Luna: "Aha, funny.." *She grunted with no enthusiasm.* "At least we're out of that place, aye."

Twenty-Three: "We're still in the turbulence of things."

Luna: "Why?" *She sighed, staring out into space with an emotionless face.*

Twenty-Three: "Not only are we in a Purity Zone, but captains can flashstep."

Nathan: *He nodded his head and reached over his shoulder, gasping in shock.* (Crud! I don't have my sword!-)

Twenty-Three: *He noticed Nathan and Luna's awkward faces, causing him to step towards them.* "Allow me, sir?" *He offered to help Luna.*

Nathan: "Take her." *He spoke in a deep voice and stepped away from Luna.*

Luna: "Umm, how 'bout no?" *She grunted and hit Trevour's hand away by coincidence.*

Twenty-Three: "I'll guide your feet-"

Luna: "I'm not disabled!"

Twenty-Three: "Errr? Heh heh." *He awkwardly chuckled, as if he didn't know what to say.*

Nathan: (She doesn't let her disability get in the way. I like that-)

Luna: *She stepped forward and tripped on a clump of ankle high grass, falling to her knees.* (My eyes.. Why hasn't my vision returned yet-?!)

Twenty-Three: "Madam?"

Luna: (Bloody shit nuggets..) *She raised her arm, keeping her head lowered in a defeated-like manner.*

Twenty-Three: *He gently pulled Luna up and held her by the elbow.* "I'll merely guide your step, nothing more, madam."

Luna: "Wateva."

Nathan: *He turned around and stared at a large castle, hiding behind an enormous stone wall.* "Sorrowprax.."

Twenty-Three: "Let's go." *He awkwardly chuckled and hobbled forward, causing Nathan to follow.*

----------

*Kath sighed on her high chair-like stool and casually checked for dirt under her nails, waiting for the warrior's response.*

Warrior: *She eagerly stared at the screen and noticed a red dot suddenly appear on a blueprint version of Sorrowprax.* "You're right, ma'am-" *She sounded surprised.*

Kath: "Of course I am. I wouldn't be at my level if I wasn't good at what I do."

Warrior: "Y-Yes-"

Kath: "Instead of stuttering like a shoe kissing commoner, give me results instead. I don't want excuses, I want results!"

Warrior: "There was a non-captain breach of Neurons in the lower quarters-"

Tara: *She knocked at the door and walked into the poorly lit room, catching Kath's attention.* (The Consultant.. I admire her so much-)

Kath: "Triple your efforts." *She spoke in a stern voice and swivelled on the stool, facing Tara in a curious-like manner.*

Warrior: "Y-Yes!" *She lowered her head, purposely typing faster on the keyboard.*

Kath: "What have you learned about these rebellious peasants attacking my warriors? Is it an uprising? A rebellion? Or a pesky guild?"

Tara: *She stopped in the middle of the room and bent down to one knee causing the sounds of leather stretching to be heard.* "None, ma'am." *She lowered her head in respect.*

Kath: "Do I need to hold your hand? Or can you flow your sentences without guidance? What did you learn?"

Tara: "She possibly had Neuron damage in the brain. She didn't know what basic things were, like Neurons and Astragons."

Kath: "How absurd."

Tara: "She claimed she was from a city that I've never heard of, fufufu."

Kath: "Herm? Very well. Dispose of them."

Tara: "Ma'am-" *She nodded her head in understanding.*

Kath: "And, I'd like you to follow up on a Neuron signature."

Tara: "Perhaps the two are linked. I have bad news to report."

Kath: "Herm?" *She sounded unimpressed, pushing her glasses up.*

Tara: "It appears two of the prisoners have escaped-"

Kath: "Escaped?!" *She stood up in anger, causing the lights to flicker in the room.*

Tara: (She!-... She is so powerful-)

Kath: "You are to go immediately and slaughter them!"

Warrior: *She discreetly listened to the conversation.* (Sending a Black Brigade warrior?)

Ridley: *He stepped forward from the shadows, glancing at Kath's back.* "I couldn't but overhear this unfortunate ordeal." *He smiled and clapped his hands together, walking up to Kath's side.*

Tara: (The-The other Consultant! What a privilege-)

Ridley: "With respect, Kath." *He mumbled and coughed to clear his throat.* "You are to capture these laughable fodder and bring them back to me alive."

Kath: (Herm?) *She leant back, as if she was allowing Ridley to give leadership.*

Ridley: "This is an S classed mission." *He looked at Tara with an excited smirk.* "I would also like you to communicate this to your leader."

Tara: (Blake-)

Ridley: "And they are to participate if you have any trouble."

Tara: "Sir." *She looked up, as if she wanted to say something.*

Ridley: "Speak." *He spoke on his breath and waved his hand, as if it was a privilege for her to speak.*

Tara: "There were three prisoners that have escaped-"

Kath: "Three? I was told one had died during the interrogation?!"

Tara: "That is correct. It was one of our own."

Kath: *She silently formed fists, trying to control her anger.* (Not only do we have a heretic, but this person has broken one of the warrior codes and used Remenistal without being a captain-)

Ridley: "Do you have any information regarding these people?"

Tara: "Sir! One is a Scoldrant User without a partner, one with no traceable Neurons and Astragons, and the other surprisingly is a Rostical User. Although, very weak-"

Kath: "You are dismissed! Out of my sight."

Tara: "Ma'am! Sir!" *She quickly stood up and punched her chest, flashstepping out of the room.*

Kath: *She listened to a faint buzzing sound whoosh from the area where Tara stood.* "What is the meaning of this sudden interest, Ridley?"

Ridley: "Let's just call it curiosity. I'm fascinated to hear more about these random places this person in strange clothing talked about." *He smirked, as if he knew more than he let on.*

Kath: "Very well. But I will be terminating this warrior."

Ridley: "That's fine by me, haha. There's no mercy for the damned. Regardless, my curiosity lies with this woman."

Kath: "They are merely delaying the inevitable."

Ridley: "I concur." *He spoke with a smile, causing Kath to chuckle.*

----------

*Rachael sniffed and stepped away from Lezard, slowly turning away.*

Twortz: "Excuse me." *She spoke under her breath in disgust, catching Lezard's attention.* "You need to call an ambulance."

Rachael: "..."

Lezard: "Oh, golly? What's that?"

Rachael: *She closed her eyes, as if she couldn't believe what she was hearing.* "Are you serious?" *She spoke on her breath and looked up in determination, glancing at Twortz.*

Twortz: "I can't berh- breathe."

Rachael: *She slowly walked towards Twortz, stepping with a limp.* "Where are you hurt?"

Twortz: *She wrapped her arms around her chest.* (It's getting worse-)

Rachael: "We're both hurt, we don't know where we are, and now we have nowhere to go."

Lezard: "I know where we are, I'm not hurt. Maybe you children could come with me? Keep me company.."

Rachael: "Could you please get help?" *She staggered up to Twortz and bent down, inspecting her body.*

Twortz: (I'm sorry..) *She thought to herself with the mind frame of giving up.*

Lezard: *He hobbled up to Twortz and Rachael, catching their attention.* "I can help.."

Rachael: "... Please.. Just, call for help.." *She spoke in distress, as if she realised the severity of Twortz's condition.*

Lezard: "Okies.." *He slowly inhaled and spread his arms over Twortz, staring at her in a serious-like manner.* "Due to her wounds, I will need to use the Rostical's incantation."

Rachael: "You're a nice guy, full of life, but please-"

Lezard: "Quick internal light-" *He frowned with concentration, causing a faint white glyph to draw itself around his feet.*

Rachael: "H-Huh?" *She looked down and stared at the forming glyph in shock.* "A platform?" *She spoke on her breath, as her face slightly glowed white from the light.*

Twortz: *She squinted her eyes, listening to the sounds of people laughing at her.* (Even to the end.. They still laugh at me-)

Lezard: "INVOKING AURA" *He shouted with an echoing voice, ignoring sudden gusts of warm air which blew around him.*

Twortz: "What is that.. Light-? Karh-?!" *She suddenly gagged in pain, watching a swirl of warm light flash around her chest.*

Rachael: *She stared at the light with a dropping jaw and slowly reached forward, gasping as the light swirled through her hand.* "I-It feels like warm water."

*The sounds of bones cracking back into place caused Twortz to scream in pain.*

Twortz: "It hurts?" *She spoke with a wheeze, but suddenly inhaled in relief.* "I can-?"

Lezard: "Phew! That was a little harder than I thought, bwarharh." *He lowered his arms and stepped forward with a loss of balance.*

Rachael: "You can talk normally-?"

Twortz: *She stood up and stared at Lezard in disbelief and gratitude.* "How-? The light-?"

Rachael: "Twortz, your bones-?" *She looked up, as if she was shocked Twortz could stand in such a manner.*

Twortz: "What are you?"

Lezard: "Bwarharh, I'm flattered. I'm just a traveller."

Rachael: *She slowly stood up, as if she wasn't sure what was happening.* "What was that light-?"

Lezard: "So, now that I have your delicious attention, could you care to give me an answer?"

Twortz: "For what?"

Lezard: "About occupying me?"

Rachael: "I..."

Lezard: "Ouchies-" *He noticed the cut on Rachael's face, causing him to reach out towards her.*

Rachael: "What are you-?"

Lezard: "Quick healing shot, HEALING IMPLOSION" *His voice echoed, as he focused on the cut.*

Rachael: "Sounds like a magic spell-?" *Light glowed in the wound, queuing it to start rapidly healing.*

Lezard: *He smiled and lowered his arm in accomplishment.* "Delicious."

Rachael: (It stings like an anti-bacterial cream was used-) *She frowned and placed her hand on her cut, causing her to rub her skin in shock.* (It's smooth?)

Twortz: *She grabbed Rachael's chin and inspected her face in amazement.* "Y-You have no cut?!"

Lezard: "Yuppers, bwarharh." *He chuckled with happiness and stepped back, giving Twortz and Rachael space.*

Rachael: "How did you heal?"

Twortz: "The light.. You healed a person's wound." *She touched her head and frowned in confusion, as if she was trying to comprehend what just happened.*

Lezard: "Using Rostical is rare as it is. But, the power of light.. Not many people in this world can do so."

Rachael: "What is Rostical?"

Twortz: "What was that light? Was it some sort of advanced nanotechnology?"

Lezard: "Nanoo...? Excuse me, child?"

Twortz: "Child? I am probably much older than you?"

Lezard: "Oh? Excuse me." *He sounded apologetic, glancing around Twortz in confusion.*

Twortz: "What are you-?"

Lezard: "I just didn't feel that strong urge of Astragons within you, so I assumed you didn't have the mastery required to prolong one's lifetime."

Rachael: "Never assume.." *She smiled with a saddened facial expression.*

Twortz: (To prolong one's lifetime? This guy may be weird, but he seems to know what he's talking about. Or, he's just completely crazy and he's good with his words?)

Lezard: "We're currently residing South West of the continent, just outside The Twilight Forest-" *He spoke in thought and looked to the side, as if he was staring out into the far distance.*

Rachael: "Twilight?"

Lezard: "We've got a delicious adventure ahead.. Perhaps I could answer these questions as we walked?"

Rachael: "Wait a minute. We never agreed to come."

Twortz: "I think we should learn as much as we can."

Rachael: "Twortz?" *She sounded shocked.*

Twortz: "If you turn out to be crazy, I'll ensure you'll receive punishment."

Lezard: "Jinkies!" *He shook his bottom in a sarcastic-like manner.* "No evil plot twists from me!"

Twortz: "And you, Rachael?"

Rachael: "Well-" *She glanced at the city and shivered, looking at Lezard with a smile.* "I'm not going in a city with that crazy woman."

Lezard: "Yay!" *He giggled, sarcastically shaking his bottom.* "Besties?"

Twortz: "No."

Lezard: "Naww."

Rachael: "So, where are we going?" *She formed a fist and stepped forward, symbolising her readiness.*

Lezard: (She's strong willed.. Although, I can a strange feeling from these two ladies-)

Twortz: "Was it, Lezard?"

Lezard: "Yay! You remembered my name, bwarharh."

Twortz: "..."

Lezard: "We head South until we reach the city." *He started to hobble forward, causing Rachael and Twortz to follow.*

Rachael: (I still don't get what's happening, but Ash.. You'd usually say something like, it's better to go with the flow, instead of going backwards and swimming against the current..)

Twortz: *She placed her hands behind her back and fastened her pace, walking by Lezard's side in a professional-like manner.* "So, about these unanswered questions."

Lezard: "Oh, yes."

----------

*Trevour, Luna and Nathan walked up a grassy slope, enjoying the strong cool breeze, which blew their hair to one side.*

Twenty-Three: *He guided Luna around small ditches in the hill, taking deep exhausted breaths.* "This is very temperamental."

Nathan: "Why don't you take your armour off?" *He noticed sweat drip off Trevour's face.*

Twenty-Three: "That's a sturdy idea, sir."

Luna: "You saved us."

Twenty-Three: *He paused, as if he mentally disagreed with Luna.* "I'm afraid to say, madam, but we aren't out of the clear yet."

Luna: "Ain't out of the clear, aye?" *She grunted on her breath.*

Nathan: *He walked on top of the hill and sighed in accomplishment, turning around to face the party.* "That was more exhausting than I thought."

Twenty-Three: "That's because this is a Purity Zone."

Luna: "Wat's a Purity Zone?"

Twenty-Three: "Well-"

Nathan: "Were you living under a rock? How do you not know anything?" *He spoke in a deep manly voice, raising an eyebrow at Luna.*

Luna: "I don't know half the shit you'se talk 'bout, aye!"

Twenty-Three: "Regardless. Purity Zones are certain areas where Neurons and Astragons don't mix."

Luna: "What are Newrongs and Astragongs."

Twenty-Three: "Err, it's Neurons and Astragons, heh heh." *He awkwardly chuckled and stood on top of the massive hill, allowing him to bend over and sigh.*

Nathan: (Man.. How can anyone not know what Neurons and Astragons are? I'm not even a Rostical User, and-)

Luna: "Gah-... I just don't know wat's happenin'." *She spoke with a frown, as if she had a headache.*

Twenty-Three: "Sorry, everyone-" *He took deep breaths and appeared sick, as if he was going to throw up.*

Nathan: *He looked annoyed and paranoid.* (I feel almost naked without my sword.)

Twenty-Three: *He turned around and sniffed, staring at an enormous castle in the distance.* "We've walked quite far."

Luna: "Amen to that." *She enthusiastically groaned in agreement.*

Twenty-Three: "You wouldn't think that something so beautiful could look so terrible inside."

Luna: "I agree."

Twenty-Three: "Wow, you do?" *He spoke with a smile and noticed Luna staring in the wrong direction in a blind-like manner.* "Oh.."

Nathan: *He sighed with a smile and looked away.* "Down there, it's a massive Purity Zone."

Twenty-Three: "Yes." *He turned back around and looked down the other side of the hill they walked up, staring at an enormous grassy plain.* "This is called The Great Divide."

Nathan: "Once you're in The Great Divide, they'll be no turning back."

Twenty-Three: "Sir?"

Nathan: "If you want, you can say we took you hostage." *He shrugged his shoulders, as if he couldn't think of anything else to say.*

Twenty-Three: "Much appreciated, my kind sir. I've decided to take this path."

Luna: (He talks similar to Ashton.. Such a goody-goody.) *She rolled her eyes in thought.*

Twenty-Three: "I'd like to ensure you two are out of harm's way."

Luna: "Pssht.." *She looked away, blinding staring out into space.*

Nathan: "You wouldn't happen to have a sword anywhere on you?"

Twenty-Three: "I'm afraid not, sir." *He patted his armour wear swords are usually kept.* "I haven't trained in captain classed abilities yet."

Nathan: *Trevour's words triggered a flashback of Zayden unsheathing a spear wrapped in a swirl of sparks.* (When.. Did that happen?)

Twenty-Three: *He slowed his breathing down, wiping sweat off his face.* (This walk..  This will be an unpleasant toll on all of us..)

Nathan: (So, a Rostical User inside the world's largest Purity Zone. Me, without a sword, and-) *He glanced at Luna.* (And a blind woman with an attitude problem of a raging Scoldrant.. Great..)

Luna: *She gently touched the swollen bags under her eyes, hissing in pain.* (They hurt..)

Nathan: "I'm not entirely sure your reasoning for helping us, but.. I'm in your debt."

Twenty-Three: "Heh heh, no need, sir. I-"

Nathan: *He shook his head, purposely stopping Trevour from continuing his sentence.* "I'm apparently Nathan, what is your name?"

Luna: (Great, and this guy acts like a knight or some shit.. The three of us are seriously completely different-)

Twenty-Three: "My name is Trevour. Trevour Meister."

Nathan: *He nodded his head and took a deep breath.* "Let's get out of this place?" *He sniffed, trying to hide his exhaustion.*

Trevour: *He nodded his head and looked at Luna.* "Shall we go, madam?"

Luna: "Wateva. Just take me to civilisation."

Trevour: "That could be arranged, madam." *He gently held Luna around the elbow and started to walk down the slope, causing his armour to rattle.*

Nathan: "I hope we don't run into Scoldrants. We're almost defenceless."

Luna: "That's it!" *She screamed, causing Trevour and Nathan to stop.* "I want answers now! Someone tell me what the hell these damned Scoldrant things are!"

Trevour: "Despite our training, I'm not really familiar with Scoldrants, besides what kind there are."

Nathan: "I do.." *He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, readying himself for a deep explanation.*

----------

Lezard: "Rachael, Twortz and me, walked along a sandy beach, watching the ocean glisten in the sun's delicious light."

Rachael: "What's with the commentary?"

Lezard: "It comforts me." *He placed his hands on his chest, sarcastically shaking his bottom.*

Twortz: "Explain more about that creature. Was it a robot?"

Lezard: "Not sure who Robbo is, but that was a Scoldrant. It had the ground element signature. That makes them impervious to physical attacks."

Rachael: *She looked at Twortz, whispering under her breath.* "Do I have to say what's happening here?"

Twortz: "That he's played way too many online MMORPG's?"

Rachael: (No... That creature.. The lack of planes and cars.. Technology.. I'm starting to grow suspicious of a crazy idea-)

Lezard: "There are also different levels of Scoldrants." *He spoke with a smile, oblivious to Rachael and Twortz's whispers.*

Twortz: "Different levels?" *She looked at the frying pan and swapped hands, allowing her to stretch her wrist.* (When I hit that.. Robotic Scoldrant, the sound.. It vibrated and-)

Lezard: "Oh?" *He turned around and faced Twortz, noticing her discomfort.* "Right now, I only excel in two Remenistal."

Rachael: "What is Remen-..?"

Lezard: "Rem-en-istal. It's just an old way of saying Rostical." *He giggled and spread his arms, focusing on Twortz's wrist.*

Rachael: "Then, what does Rostical mean?"

Lezard: "Really? It's what I used to heal your wounds."

Twortz: (I got it! This has to be some sort of hi-tech holographic game! What else could explain all this, and this type of gaming.. I don't know much, but I hear the younger staff talking about their games all the time.)

Lezard: "Quick internal light, INVOKING AURA" *He shouted with an echoing voice, watching a white platform draw itself underneath him.*

Rachael: (Rostical.. So it's like magic-) *She thought to herself in amazement, watching warm light flash around Twortz's wrist.*

Twortz: *She sighed in relief, causing her to open and close her hand.* (The strain in my wrist has completely disappeared? This is not possible. Therefore, it has to be some sort of illusion of holographic experience-)

Lezard: "Back to what we were talking about before." *He smiled and turned around, continuing to walk in the direction they were headed.*

Rachael: "Scoldrants?"

Twortz: "Regardless of where we are or what we're in. You have my appreciation."

Lezard: "Naww, not really sure what you mean by that, but thankies!" *He waved his arms and giggled at Twortz, as if he was happy with what she said.*

Rachael: "Hehe." (This guy is cool.)

Twortz: (Instead of respecting my appreciation, he acts in an immature-like manner and spouts made up words.. This gentleman is very troubling.) *She sighed in thought.*

Lezard: "So where was I? Oh, yeah! The different levels of Scoldrants."

----------

Nathan: "There are different types of Scoldrants in terms of power."

Trevour: "Fascinating."

Nathan: "First, you have regular Scoldrants. These Scoldrants have no special abilities."

Luna: "Is lightning weak to water?" *She grunted on her breath, rolling her eyes.*

Trevour: "Yes? I know my elemental affinities." *He spoke in appreciation oblivious to Luna's sarcasm.*

Luna: "Just wateva." *She grunted and awkwardly stepped down the hill, as she continued to walk in a blind-like manner.*

Trevour: "Sir?"

Nathan: "Then you have long-lived Scoldrants."

Trevour: "I've heard about these fellows. The Consultants or captains usually send us off as a group."

Luna: "Wat's so special about these things?"

Nathan: "They just have stronger attributes than normal Scoldrants. Nothing more."

Trevour: "Next, should be Rostical Using Scoldrants, correct?"

Luna: "There's that Rostickal word again."

Nathan: "Rostical.. The ability to manipulate the elements."

Luna: "Wat? Don't be bullshittin' me!"

Trevour: (Once again, she doesn't know such basic common knowledge? I'm getting a little weary here-)

Nathan: (After Rostical Using Scoldrants, you have Guardians.. Guardians have been known to rival certain single digit warriors in terms of strength and power.)

Trevour: "Do you know anything else?"

Nathan: "No.." *He grunted and held the side of his head.* (I do, but I don't?)

Trevour: (Looks like he's still suffering from the Neuron memory loss.)

Luna: *She noticed she walked on flat land.* "I might not be able to see right now, but I get the feeling it's a big field we're in."

Trevour: *He admired the bright green plain and watched lines of sunlight shine off the grass, as it blew in the cool breeze.* "You're definitely not wrong, madam."

Nathan: "Where exactly do we have to go?"

Trevour: *He scanned across the magnificent plain, focusing his attention on an enormous forest to his right.* "We head West and travel around the forest as cover."

Nathan: "Alright." *He mumbled in a deep voice and started to walk in the direction Trevour motioned.*

Luna: "OK, I'll play along to this charade. Tell me more about this world."

Trevour: "Heh heh, you almost sound like you don't come from here."

Luna: "Aha, funny." *She spoke with no enthusiasm.*

Nathan: "What would be the closest village? I need to buy a sword right away."

Trevour: "Buy with what?"

Nathan: "I have-" *He patted around his belt, causing him to grunt in shock.* "I don't-"

Trevour: "It is fine, sir. I have enough for a sword."

Nathan: *He shook his head, as if he didn't want Trevour to pay for it.* "You don't-"

Trevour: "I heard how hard it was for the lower ranking warriors to capture you. You must be skilled with the sword."

Nathan: *He looked down while walking and watched the grass sway around his feet.* "I am."

Trevour: "So, you're also a Scoldrant User."

Nathan: "I'm nothing."

Luna: "..."

Trevour: "No need to be so down on yourself."

Nathan: *He chuckled in disgust.* "No. Don't categorise me with a title. I'm Nathan.. That's it."

Trevour: "Alright? I don't quite follow you, but sure, sir."

Trevour: "Can either of you use Rostical?" *He watched the trees of the forest become larger, as they slowly towered into the sky.*

Nathan: *He stepped into the shade caused by the large trees.* "Haha. No."

Luna: "Nah, never tried."

Trevour: (Never tried?) *He glanced at Luna in confusion, before focusing his attention on Nathan.* "What was with that reaction?"

Nathan: "Let's just say, I don't like Rostical Users."

Trevour: "Sir? Rostical Users help govern the rules and-"

Nathan: "I don't want to talk about it." *He grunted in a stern-like manner.*

Trevour: "It was Rostical that freed us from Sorrowprax, you didn't seem to complain then."

Luna: "Ooo, snap. He gotcha there."

Nathan: "Hmph."

Luna: "Tell me more about this Rostickal."

Nathan: "I only know the basics, but, I can't remember the rest." *He frowned, rubbing his forehead.*

Luna: "Too bad I wasn't askin' you anyways."

Nathan: "..."

Trevour: "I'm a Rostical User with the elemental affinity of ground."

Nathan: (That's how we were able to escape so easily-)

Luna: "If you can use magic, then prove it! Manipulate the ground underneath me!"

Trevour: "But, madam, I can't-"

Luna: "Thought so!" *She grunted and frowned, purposely tilting her head away from Trevour.*

?????: "Oh my, Rostical can't be used here." *A woman with a high tone of voice caught Trevour, Nathan and Luna's attention.*

Nathan: "Who's there?!" *He grunted and stood in a battle-ready pose, forming fists.*

Luna: (I can't-) *She looked in the general direction of the woman's voice.*

Trevour: *He frowned and stepped in front of Luna, intensely staring at the trees.* (That voice, there may be two hundred and fifty warriors, but I don't recognise that voice-)

?????: *She hobbled out from behind a thick tree, panting in an exhausted state.* "Hello."

Nathan: "Who are you?!"

Trevour: "Are you friend or foe?!"

?????: "Oh my. A friend perhaps? I mean no harm."

Nathan: "You look pretty beat up."

?????: "I used my powers, so I had to hide."

Nathan: (She looks familiar..)

Trevour: "Oh, but why, madam?"

????? *She took a deep breath and wiped sweat off her face.* "I guess it was a silly idea after all."

Trevour: "Judging by your similar physical condition.. You're a Rostical User too, correct?"

?????: *She smiled, as if Trevour was right.* "They call me the champion."

Luna: "Aye?"

Nathan: (The champion?!) *He grunted to himself, closely observing the woman with a large hunchback.* (It feels like I've seen her somewhere before, but I can't remember!)

Luna: "We're also running away from people, aye."

Champion: "Oh? Who." *She noticed Trevour's warrior armour, causing her to refrain from saying anything more.*

Nathan: "He may be a warrior, but I owe this guy my life."

Trevour: "Your compliments are most welcome. Either way, things will be less turbulent once we're out of this Purity Zone."

Champion: "I couldn't agree more." *She spoke in a high, innocent-like manner, smiling at Trevour in agreement.*

Trevour: (I can certainly feel the drawbacks of not being able to use my Rostical.)

Champion: "I know it's sudden, but could I please join your party?" *She smiled and paused, waiting for the party's answer.*

Luna: "Wait? A party? There's no party 'round here?"

Trevour: "She mean us, as a group."

Luna: "Rightio.."

Champion: "Your eyes-" *She spoke in a sorrowful-like manner.*

Luna: *She frowned in anger.* "Your voice! But you don't see me pointing it out."

Trevour: "Technically, it should be, you don't hear me pointing it out-"

Luna: "Shuddup."

Trevour: "S-Sorry, madam."

Luna: "How about, I shove wateva item I find up your metallic goody-goody ass, and-"

Champion: *She ignored Luna and Trevour's bickering, focusing on the puffy burns around her eyes.* (The damage around her eyes, that's undoubtedly a fire based Rostical.)

Nathan: "Can we all shut up?"

Luna: *She growled, intensely staring in Nathan's general direction.* "You.."

Trevour: "..." *He looked at Luna and stared at her face in deep thought.* (I may not know any of these people that well, but I can tell how upset she is. She must've endured a lot of pain if she can mask something like this so well-)

*A siren-like horn echoed in the distance, instantly catching the party's attention.*

Champion: "Oh my, that doesn't sound good."

Luna: "W-Wat's that?" *She looked to each side in a blind-like manner.*

Nathan: Crap."

Trevour: "How temperamental! They've just discovered we're missing."

Nathan: "How far away until we get out of the Purity Zone?"

Champion: "It should be about another thirty minutes?"

Trevour: *He nodded his head and gently held Luna's elbow, quickly walking on the outskirts of the forest.* (Thirty minutes.. If they send someone strong enough, they could get here in five minutes.)

Champion: (Hiding in a Purity Zone.. I honestly had no other choice-)

Nathan: *He power walked with the party, glancing at the champion.* "What's your story? Are you running from the warriors too?"

Champion: "I am right now, aren't I?"

Nathan: "That's not what I mean."

Trevour: "Why else would you hide in a Purity Zone?"

Champion: "I am running. But not from the warriors."

Nathan: "From who then?"

Champion: ".. Let's focus on getting out of here, okay?"

Trevour: "Sounds great to me."

Luna: (Luna.. Please wake up..)

Chapter 4: The Future Guardian

Lezard: "Lezard and the ladies continued to walk to their destination, before noticing a delicious cottage up ahead."

Twortz: "Stop the commentary-?"

Lezard: "There." *He giggled and pointed forward, drawing Rachael and Twortz's attention to several straw-made huts.*

Rachael: "The huts look Hawaiian?"

Lezard: "I believe this is The Seaside Village."

Twortz: "Could we please rest?" *She sighed, taking deep breaths.*

Lezard: *He noticed the sweat pour off Twortz, causing him to hiss in disgust.* "If you don't mind me asking-"

Twortz: "I do-"

Lezard: "What on the lost Astragons caused you to be so large?"

Twortz: "Excuse me?"

Rachael: "Lezard, that isn't an appropriate question to ask?"

Lezard: "I was just curious-"

Twortz: "Curiosity killed the cat?" *She growled, raising the frying pan with killing intent.*

Lezard: "Jinkies! Please, I'm too young to die!" *He squealed, sarcastically wiggling his bottom to each side.*

Rachael: "Oh brother." *She face palmed and continued to walk towards the village.*

Twortz: *She noticed Rachael face palming, causing her to cough in a professional-like manner.* "I apologise for allowing my personal feelings to get the better of me. I would like you not to mention my figure or weight again, please?"

Lezard: "What a shocking turn around? Of course! I'll try my best-"

*A young man squealed and ran down the shore, catching the party's attention.*

?????: "Me needs help!" *He squealed and struggled to lift his feet off the sand, causing him to awkwardly lean to each side.*

Twortz: "What is it now?" *She hissed under her breath, staring at the man in an annoyed-like manner.*

Rachael: "Who-?"

?????: "Bad, it bad!" *He whimpered in fear, running towards Rachael in a fright.*

Lezard: *He observed the man, tilting his head in curiosity.* "A young man, with a deliciously small nose ran towards me and the girls in fright."

Twortz: "There is nothing delicious about a nose."

Lezard: "Allow me to pick my own adverbs, thankies!"

Twortz: "How unprofessional." *She pretended to cough the words, glancing at Lezard.*

Lezard: "Lezard ignored the large vile beast and continued to annoyingly describe this gentleman's appearance."

Twortz: (I'm better than this-) *She gritted her teeth and looked away, closing her eyes in a calm-like manner.* (He's the type of customer that would disrupt the entire dining room-)

?????: "Lucky needs help, hyuck hyuck." *He chuckled in fear and rubbed his ears, bending over to catch his breath.*

Rachael: "Umm.." *She stepped back and slightly bent her knees, trying to look at his face.* "What's wrong?"

Lezard: "Ooo!" *He gasped in amazement, taking a closer look at the man.* "He has one blue and green eye, but you can't really tell because he squints one eye, naww, that's cute."

Twortz: *She stared at Lezard with an emotionless face.* "What. Are. You. Doing..?"

Rachael: "What's your name?"

?????: "Lucky, hyuck hyuck. Lucky my name." *He leant up and continued to rub his ears, trying to express his distress.*

Rachael: "Lucky?"

Lucky: "Me?" *He pointed at himself, as if he was confused.*

Twortz: "It appears he dresses himself, it's quite apparent..."

Lezard: "That's mean." *He frowned with a sarcastic pout.* "Poor little Lucky."

Rachael: (He has autism?)

Lucky: "Lucky find help, help please." *He rocked back and forth, as if he was nervous to hear their answer.*

Twortz: "We can't just-"

Rachael: "Unacceptable." *She spoke under her breath, quickly looking at Lucky with an enthusiastic smile.* "Of course, we'll help you."

Twortz: "..."

Lezard: "Rachy, one. Meanie, zero."

Twortz: "Please be quiet." *She coughed and spoke in a professional-like manner, causing Lezard to whine in defeat.*

Rachael: "What's wrong, Lucky?"

Lucky: "My friend, he sick. Needs help." *He grabbed Rachael's hand like a child and stepped back, as if he wanted to run back in the direction he came from.*

Rachael: "Let's go?"

Twortz: (She really is like Ashton..) *She sighed in thought and hesitantly nodded her head.*

Lucky: "This way, Lucky show!" *He spoke with determination and pulled Rachael forward, running onto the sand.*

Lezard: "Oh no, not more running." *He pouted and stretched his arms, as if he was about to run a marathon.*

Twortz: "Suck it up." *She spoke in a condescending manner.*

Lezard: "Ouchies. And here I was thinking you were allergic to running, bwarharh." *He hobbled past Twortz and onto the sand, chasing after Rachael and Lucky.*

Twortz: (Allergic?) *She tilted the frying pan and stared at her reflection, observing her triple chin in disgust.* (I know what I am.. I can't help it-)

Rachael: "Twortz!"

Twortz: *She looked up and started to waddle across the grass in the direction the party ran towards.* (Unless they're going into the water, there's no need to go on the sand and waste energy.)

----------

*Luna, Nathan, Trevour and the champion walked around thick trees, stepping over rocks, sticks and other obstacle-like parts of the terrain.*

Trevour: *He frowned in exhaustion and quickly tugged Luna closer, allowing her to blissfully avoid a thick tree.* "Should we rest, everyone-?"

Nathan: "No."

Champion: "We should at least wait until we're out of this Purity Zone." *She spoke with a high innocent-like tone of voice.*

Trevour: "O-Okay."

Luna: "I'm gettin' tired." *She looked up and sighed with a dropping jaw.*

Champion: *She noticed the smeared black make-up all over Luna's face.* "Do you possess Rostical?"

Luna: "Gah! Not this Rostickal thing again!"

Champion: "Oh my? I don't under-?"

Trevour: "Nathan has temporary memory loss, and Luna appears to not know any basic fundamental rules of this world.."

Luna: "Aye?"

Nathan: "What are you talking about?" *He raised an eyebrow in curiosity, before placing his hands on his head.*

Trevour: "I have a hard time understanding how someone, no matter where they're from, does not know the basics of life."

Luna: "I-..?"

Champion: "Well, I'll be happy to teach you." *She smiled and spoke in a carefree manner, as if she didn't care.*

Nathan: "So, she's from the stars?" *He looked confused, pointing towards the sky.*

Trevour: "I'm not sure, sir-"

Luna: "Stop talkin' like I'm not here, and I'm no damned alien!"

Trevour, Champion and Nathan: "Alien?"

Luna: "Wat the f-?"

Champion: "So, Rostical." *She smiled and hobbled to each side, as if she wasn't bothered by Luna's lack of knowledge.*

Luna: *She pouted in a defeated-like manner, as if she wanted to leave.* (If I knew where I was and if my vision was back, I'd ditch these freaks-)

Champion: "You have Neurons. Neurons are-"

Luna: "Just stop." *She sighed, causing the champion to look confused.*

Trevour: "But, madam, she's telling you what you should already know-"

Luna: "Did Lance put you up to this? OK, come on out, brother."

Trevour: "Lance? A weapon?"

Luna: "No, my-, gah! Don't worry 'bout it-"

*The champion and Trevour suddenly gasped in pleasure, causing Luna to pull an awkward face.*

Luna: "If anythin' rank touches me, I won't be afraid to bite that shit off-"

Nathan: "No, I think that means we're out of the Purity Zone now."

Trevour: "Affirmative, sir. Heh heh." *He smirked and took a deep breath filled with growing confidence.*

Champion: "Oh my, this feels great."

Luna: "I gotta admit, you're determination to keep up this stupid joke is-" *She paused in mid-sentence, causing Trevour to stop.*

Nathan: "What is it now?"

Luna: "Who's there?"

Champion: "Who? Who are you speaking to?"

Luna: "The wind? Someone's standin' next to me, right?"

Trevour: *He looked past Luna, causing him to shake his head.* "Negative. There's nobody there, madam."

Luna: "But that feelin'?"

Trevour: "See?" *He swayed his arm across, showing that nobody else was there.*

Luna: "Oh, yea."

Trevour- "Excel-" *He paused in realisation.* (Blast, she got me again.)

Champion: "Now that I have Rostical, I'll take my leave-"

Nathan: "Huh?" *He looked confused, glancing in the direction Luna mentioned.* "I feel something coming towards us."

Luna: "See?"

Trevour: "But-?" *He gently let go of Luna's elbow, slowly becoming weary.* (This woman.) *He thought to himself in confusion, glancing at Luna.* (Everything about her doesn't make sense-)

Champion: "If you're running away from the warriors, maybe it's the stress clouding your judge-?"

?????: "Noellll!" *A deep snarly roar echoed from the forest, causing the sounds of bristling leaves to be heard.*

Luna: "Wateva that was, it wasn't me."

Champion: "That sounded like a Scoldrant."

Nathan: "Well, it certainly isn't a warrior."

Champion: "Oh my, you're right." *She spoke with a smile and hobbled backwards, keeping a safe distance from the forest.*

Nathan: "It sucks, I don't have a sword-"

Luna: "Why are you bein' such a pussy? Use your fists like a man."

Nathan: "Like a man? That's sexist."

Luna: "Huh-?" *She sounded shocked.*

*A large green chameleon stepped outside the forest, glaring at the party with its elongated eyes.*

Scoldrant: "Nooeell."

Trevour: "Sir! Since you can't currently fight, take the madam!"

Luna: "I have a freakin' name!-"

Nathan: "Just shut up! If you want proof about Rostical, here's your chance."

Luna: "Ah, sure! I'll keep my eyes peeled open-"

Trevour: "You said you're a Rostical User, what elemental affinity are you?!" *He shouted in a worried-like manner and stared at the Scoldrant with a frown.*

Champion: "What is it weakened too?"

Trevour: "It looks reptilian, perhaps ice? Or maybe fire since it's green-?"

Nathan: *He held his head in pain, as if he was remembering something.* "It's weakened to the ground affinity."

Trevour: "Ground? Fantastic."

Champion: "How do you know that?"

Trevour: "He's a Scoldrant-" *He paused in mid-sentence.* "I mean-"

Nathan: "Tssk-" *He sighed, glancing at the champion.* "I know my Scoldrants. Trust me."

Luna: "Borin'-"

Scoldrant: "Noelll! Sonic Roar." *It roared out of shock wave at Trevour, causing a vortex of wind to blow past him.*

Trevour: "T-Temperamental!" *He crossed his arms, standing in a solid form.*

Champion: *She stood out of the vortex's range, watching Trevour hold his own.* (His stance is very strong-)

Luna: "Pathet-" *The vortex of wind violently blew her clothes and black hair back.* "Gah-?!"

Nathan: *He frowned and stood in front of Luna, weakening the shock wave's strength.* (That's strong for a mid-strength Scoldrant-)

Champion: "I have this! ICICLE EDGE" *She swayed her arm downwards, causing four spears of ice to blast down from the sky.*

Nathan: *He looked up, watching mist spiral around the falling ice spears.* (She uses ice!-)

Scoldrant: *It suddenly hopped to the side, closely avoiding the ice spears.* "Neololooo-"

Luna: "C'mon! Use your magic already!"

Nathan: "She just did."

Luna: "Yea, no." *She sounded unconvinced.*

Trevour: *He straightened his arms and clapped his hands shut, causing a brown glyph to zigzag underneath him.* "SWIRLING SANDPIT"

Scoldrant: *A splash of sand swirled around one of its legs, causing it to lean to one side.* "Noe-?"

Champion: "Excellent!" *She swayed her arms and spun around, causing a blue glyph of swirls to draw itself underneath her feet.*

Luna: *She stared into space with a dropping jaw, as if she was imagining what was happening.* "Bull. Shit."

Trevour: "Let's do this, madam!" *He shouted with an echoing voice and dropped to one knee.*

Champion: "Right after you! AQUA LIQUID" *She swayed her arm up, causing a sudden wave of water to splash the Scoldrant across the face.*

Scoldrant: "Noel!-" *It lifted its foot and hopped back, preparing to charge towards Trevour.*

Nathan: (It freed itself!) *He formed fists, as if he wanted to participate in the fight.*

Trevour: "Oh, no you don't! DUST STORM"

*A ring of sand splashed like water and grew in speed, suddenly erupting up underneath the Scoldrant's chin.*

Scoldrant: "Neeeooo!-" *It roared in pain, as a high pressured stream of moving sand violently grazed its scales.*

Trevour: "Fantastic!-"

Scoldrant: "Sonic Rush." *It swayed its leg to the side, blowing a scattered shock wave past Trevour.*

Trevour: "Ah-?" *He slid across the ground and stumbled back, falling onto his back, causing his armour to rattle.* "St-Sturdy!"

Champion: (The ability to use sand is very rare!-) "Use a rock based attack and we'll try and crack its legs, allowing us to flee!"

Luna: (Th-They're using m-magic?!)

Trevour: "I can't."

Champion: "Oh my? You can use sand? You have to use rock."

Trevour: "I'm afraid not-"

Luna: "K-Kill it!" *She screamed with growing fear.* "With fire! With fire!"

Nathan: "It's resistant to fire!-"

Luna: "Burn it! Fire!-" *She twitched in sheer terror, causing Nathan to grab her.*

Nathan: "Shut up-"

Luna: "D-Don't tell me wat to-, th-this is fucked!-"

Nathan: "I'm holding you because I'm here. I know its weaknesses, okay? I'll make sure you're fine."

Luna: *She uncontrollably twitched in fear.* "Fucking magic, man!"

Nathan: "I promise." *He tightened his hold around Luna, emphasising his words.*

Luna: *She slowly nod her head in understanding.* "W-Wateva..."

Champion: (This isn't good. Despite regaining the ability to use Rostical again. I'm still weak from running away from them-)

Trevour: *He leant up and awkwardly stood on his feet, straightening his body.* "It's got a strong Rasticplash behind its attacks-"

Scoldrant: "Sonic Roar." *It leant back and opened its toothless mouth, roaring out a shock wave.*

Trevour: *He quickly clapped his hands and focused, causing a brown zigzagged glyph to draw itself under his feet.* "DUST-"

*The vortex-like shock wave hit Trevour and blasted him off his feet, knocking him across the ground.*

Luna: "W-What's happenin'?" *She looked to each side, trying to hide her obvious fear.*

Nathan: "If I had my sword-"

Trevour: "Ooof!-" *He heavily hit the ground and coughed, frowning with gritted teeth.* "That was a critical-"

Champion: "I have an idea!"

Scoldrant: "Noel!" *It suddenly crawled towards Trevour and raised one fin-like arm, readying to hit him.*

Nathan: (It's fast!) *He shuffled further away from the Scoldrant, ensuring Luna was at a safe distance.*

Trevour: *He raised his arm over his face, bracing himself for an attack.* "No!-"

Champion: "MYSTIC SHIELD"

Scoldrant: "Noelll!" *It swept its arm across, only to be blocked by a silver glass-like shield.*

Trevour: *He watched the Scoldrant lean back and suddenly jab towards him, hitting the shield.* (She knows Mystic Shield? She's a defensive and offensive Rostical User-)

Nathan: "What's the plan?!"

Champion: "Do you know your incantations?"

Trevour: *He shook his head.* "Negative!"

Champion: *She quickly hobbled towards Trevour, keeping a fixated stare on the Scoldrant.* (I don't like fighting in striking distance, but I need to tell him my plan!)

----------

Lucky: "This way, hyuck hyuck." *He suddenly stopped in the middle of the shore, causing Rachael to look to each side in confusion.*

Rachael: "Where-?"

Lucky: "My best friend downstairs."

Rachael: "Downstairs?"

Lezard: *He hobbled up to Rachael and Lucky, taking deep, exhausted breaths.* "Where has the delightful Lucky taken us?"

Lucky: "Need wait, hyuck." *He rubbed his eyes and rocked back and forth.*

Rachael: "He says his best friend was downstairs?"

Lezard: "Down-?" *He tilted his head towards his feet, causing him to notice a sand coloured platform.* "Ooo."

Twortz: *She noticed the party clutter together, queuing her to walk onto the sand.* "What did you find?"

Lezard: "These glyphic markings-"

Rachael: "The patterns on the hard sand?"

Lezard: "Bwarharh, these aren't just any patterns."

Lucky: "Glyph is charging, we go when flash."

Lezard: *He nodded his head, taking a closer look at the glyphs.* "You don't often see these kind of markings, but I'm sure they're similar to transportation."

Twortz: "Transportation? Have we found accommodation?" *She bent forward and exhaled, causing the sand to blow away.*

Rachael: "Wow, you must be puffed, Twortz."

Twortz: "...?"

Lezard: (Hmm? Her breath. Was that Astragon induced?)

Lucky: *He noticed the glyph underneath the party glow, causing him to applaud in excitement.* "It ready!"

Twortz: "I don't see any sort of accommodation-?" *She noticed the area around her started to blur and swirl, causing her to drop the frying pan in shock.*

*The frying pan hit the platform, causing a loud echoing sound to vibrate the air.*

Lezard: "I see."

Rachael: "W-What's happening?!"

Lezard: "We're being teleported."

Twortz: "T-Teleported-?!"

Lezard: *He coughed to clear his throat.* "The area blurred with Astragons and swirled, as the glyph began to generate enough Neurons to teleport the amazing party to its destination."

Lucky: "Hyuck hyuck!" *He jumped up, clapping his hands in excitement.*

Lezard: "Our delicious man, Lucky, jumped in happiness, ignoring the girls-" *He looked at Rachael and Twortz, causing him to look awkward.* "With faces of despair and terror-"

Rachael: "I'm getting l-light headed?" *She started to buckle at the knees, catching Lezard's attention.*

Lezard: (We haven't teleported yet, why is she displaying such symptoms-?)

*The glyph glowed and suddenly flashed a bright purple light, blinding the party.*

----------

*Rachael, Twortz, Lezard and Lucky slowly opened their eyes, noticing it was much colder than before.*

Rachael: "Where-?"

Lezard: *He looked up, noticing he was underground.* "Delicious! The underground catacombs underneath The Seaside Village?"

Twortz: "Underground, excuse me?"

Lucky: "We under water, hyuck hyuck." *He giggled, jumping on the spot.*

Rachael: "Urgh.." *She moaned in a sickly manner, placing a hand on her head.*

Twortz: *She picked up the frying pan and slowly stood up, almost losing balance.* "I vaguely hear the beach outside?"

Lezard: "Ooo! You're playing too?!" *He giggled and shook his bottom, observing the area around him.* "The majestic scenery was lit up by a natural green colour. It was distinctively underground and had several crystals-"

Rachael: "They look like solar lights?"

Twortz: "Are they really-?" *She waddled towards the closest glowing crystal, causing her to gasp in amazement.* "Rachael, these are crystal."

Rachael: *She sat on the ground, taking deep breaths of exhaustion.* "Cool-"

Lezard: "Are you okay, little monster?"

Rachael: "Yeah-"

Lucky: "This way, this way, hyuck hyuck!"

Lezard: *He looked at Lucky's back and bent down, helping Rachael onto her feet.* "I think it's time you tell us what's happening, Lucky?"

Lucky: "Friend, he need help!"

Twortz: *She twirled the frying pan in her hand and swayed it to the side, noticing a loud whoosh-like noise.* "Hmm?"

Lezard: "Scary wind noises?" *He glanced over Twortz and looked into the distance, trying to spot where the noise came from.*

Rachael: *She sniffed and wiped her forehead, as if she wanted to continue.* "I don't know why I suddenly feel like crap-"

Twortz: "Are we going to make a move on?"

Rachael: *She breathed through her mouth and stared at the ground.* "Lead the way to your best friend, Lucky."

Lucky: "Oh 'kay! Hyuck, hyuck." *He smiled in an oblivious-like manner and started to jog down a rocky path.*

Lezard: "Let's go-"

Twortz: *She suddenly power walked with a slight waddle past Lezard, trying to keep up with Lucky.* (Wherever we are.. When have I given up? I need to keep telling myself this-)

*Twortz firmly held onto the frying pan and smiled in determination.*

Twortz: (I'm a survivor.. I had to deal with unimaginable stuff back in Dee Highs. The same applies here!)

Lezard: *He wrapped Rachael's arm over the back of his head and started to follow Lucky and Twortz.* (I like to think of myself as a carefree person, but-)

Twortz: "You should not bounce around like that. You could become a hazard to not only yourself, but others."

Lucky: "Bouncy Lucky is a happy Lucky."

Twortz: "Tsst." *She rolled her eyes, as if she disapproved of Lucky's behaviour.*

Lezard: (She is too serious in my honest opinion-)

Rachael: *She looked to her side, staring at Lezard with a smile.* "Thanks, Lezard."

Lezard: "Oh? For what, missy?"

Rachael: "We don't know each other and you're willing to help out to such extremes."

Lezard: "If I don't try, how else could we become besties?"

Rachael: "Hehe-"

Twortz: *She placed her hands behind her back, keeping a straight face.* "Rachael, don't get left behind." *She spoke without looking away from Lucky.*

Rachael: "Sure!"

Lezard: "..."

Lucky: *He suddenly felt his chest and squealed in fright, catching the party's attention.* "He hurt, it can't control!"

Rachael: "He's hurt?"

Twortz: (More like, who can't control themselves?)

Lucky: "At bottom of spiral path." *He started to run, causing Twortz to frown in determination.*

Lezard: "Our friends, and Twortz-" *He mumbled the last two words.* "Started to run down a spiral path along the cave's magnificent wall, which slowly led downwards-"

*Lezard leant away from the wall and looked down to the side, noticing eerie green mist-like light on the bottom.*

Rachael: "That looks like a long drop, doesn't it?"

Lezard: "Yuppers! It looks deliciously scary."

Rachael: "You talk funny." *She spoke with a smile, as if she wasn't being mean.*

Lezard: "Well, I could talk like my mother. All strict and stuff." *He spoke in boredom, glancing at Twortz's back.*

Rachael: "What are your parents like?"

Lezard: "Sorry, I only reveal that on the third date."

Rachael: "Hehe."

Lezard: "Bwarharharh."

Lucky: "Hyuck hyuck!" *He laughed out loud.*

Twortz: "What appears to be funny?"

Lucky: "They giggle, I do too, hyuck hyuck." *He chuckled and started to rub his ears by habit.*

Twortz: "How much longer until we reach our designated target?"

Lucky: "Another twenty spirals." *He smiled and continued to jog down the path.*

Twortz: *She looked up covered in sweat, noticing she was only one spiral down from where they started.* "Another twenty?!"

Rachael: "Could you run a little faster while still supporting me?"

Lezard: "Ooo, let's try?" *He giggled and started to hobble slightly faster down the path.*

Rachael: *She swayed to each side, as if it was more awkward to run.* "No use-"

Lezard: "Oh dear-" *He stopped and accidentally tripped on Rachael's foot, causing their legs to lock in a scissor-like manner.*

Rachael: "Good grief!-"

Lezard: *He suddenly stumbled to the side, causing them to gasp at the same time.* "We're going to fall off!-"

Twortz: *She looked up, frowning in an annoyed-like manner.* (Rachael forces us to save this autistic child's friend, and she's the one lagging behind-)

Rachael: *She leant over the path and watched one of Lezard's feet slip off the path.* (No!-)

Lezard: (I-I'm about to fall?!)

Rachael: (I can't see the bottom, but it's a huge drop! Maybe the same size of a small building in the city!-) *She rocked her body back, trying to use the motion to pull Lezard away from the ledge.*

Lezard: "If you reach The Ruins of Estel and meet my father, tell him I love him-" *He spoke on his breath in a serious-like manner and purposely let go of Rachael's arm, so that he wouldn't take her with him.*

Rachael: *She watched Lezard fall backwards in slow motion.* "No!" *She swayed her arms in a grabbing-like motion, causing a curved platform of rock to shoot out from the ground underneath.*

*The platform caught Lezard and swirled back on to the path like a boomerang, knocking Rachael off her feet.*

Lezard: "I-? You saved-?" *He spoke in shock, as if he wasn't expecting to be saved.*

Rachael: "Argh!" *She screamed in pain, as her shins started to bruise from where the platform knocked her off her feet.*

Lezard: "Oh noes!" *He noticed the platform of rock suddenly spiral down the path at an increasing speed.*

Rachael: *She scrunched her eyes shut in pain.* (It hurts too much-)

Twortz: *She stopped with a frown and turned around, readying to yell at Lezard.* "What are you doing up-?"

*Twortz paused in mid-sentence, watching Rachael and Lezard ride the rocky platform directly towards her.*

Twortz: "What-?"

Lezard: "Brace for impact!" *He hissed at Twortz and covered his face, readying to collide into her.*

Twortz: "This will ruin my day-"

*The platform hit Twortz and swept her off her feet, continuing to spiral down the path.*

Twortz: *She collapsed on top of Rachael and started to yell in shock.* "Where did this come from?!"

Rachael: "Ahhh." *She started to scream louder, corresponding to the increasing speed of the rock platform.*

Lucky: "Hyuck-?" *He looked behind him, noticing the party in striking distance.* "Wha-?"

*The platform swept Lucky off his feet, causing him to sit on Twortz's back.*

Twortz: *Her face was forced closer to Lezard.* "Your odour is very distinctive."

Lezard: "Well, excuse me." *He sarcastically spoke in a girl-like manner.* "I've been trying to find someone very important. It's not my fault I've neglected bath time."

Twortz: "And-" *She growled at Lucky.* "G-Get off me!"

Lezard: "Could be worse."

Twortz: "How?"

Lezard: "You could be the one on top."

Twortz: "Excuse me-?!"

Lezard: "And you're certainly excused." *He smiled, ignoring Twortz's hair which flapped in his face.*

Lucky: "Wee!" *He chuckled and clapped his hands, as if he was on a theme park ride.*

Rachael: *She opened her eyes, noticing the platform slowly spin at an angle, causing her to gasp in shock.* "We're going to fall off the edge!"

Lezard: "Jinkies! Everyone lean away from the ledge!" *He started to lean away from the ledge, causing the party besides Lucky to do the same.*

Rachael: "It's not working!"

Lucky: "Lucky picking up on speed! Hyuck hyuck." *He chuckled with growing excitement, as if he was really enjoying the ride, oblivious to the danger.*

Twortz: (We need something else to push-) *She thought with urgency, triggering a flashback of the frying pan creating a whoosh-like noise.*

Lezard: "Rachael, please stop this!"

Rachael: "Stop? Me? How can I stop this?!"

Lezard: "It was you that did this, wasn't it?!"

Rachael: "No!-"

Twortz: *She struggled and awkwardly freed her hand, allowing her to move the frying pan to each side.* (I'm not sure how this works, but-)

*Twortz swayed the frying pan, causing a loud whoosh-like sound to slightly push the platform away.*

Rachael: "What was that?"

Lezard: "She's making herself useful!"

Twortz: *She swayed the frying pan like a large fan, causing more noise to slightly push the platform away.* "I-It's working!"

Rachael: "Awesome work, Twortz! How are you doing that?!"

Lezard: "She excels in Astragons! It's magnificent, even for her!"

Lucky: "Weee!" *He clapped his hands, noticing the path become more rigid up ahead.* "More fun!"

Rachael: "What was that, Lucky-?"

*A natural slope in the path suddenly knocked the platform, causing it to spin back towards the ledge.*

Lezard: "Jinkies! We're riding it faster than before!"

Twortz: (I have to-) *She swayed the frying pan, causing a whoosh-like sound to echo.*

Rachael: "I heard it, but nothing happened!" *She was pinned down under the party, effectively disabling her from looking over her shoulder.*

Lezard: "What a fun way to die?"

Twortz: "I don't give up!" *She continued to sway the frying pan, ignoring the fact it did nothing.*

Lucky: "Weee! Hyuck hyuck!" *He wiggled his bottom on top of Twortz, oblivious of it hurting her.*

Twortz: (I can't!-) *She gritted her teeth in desperation, noticing the green mist as the platform slid closer to the ledge.*

Lezard: "Goodbye cruel world!-"

Twortz: (I feel sick!-) *Her body glowed a shade of blue, catching Lezard's attention.*

Lezard: "An Azure Burst!-"

Twortz: "Words?" *She looked up in confusion.* "Who said that-?"

Lezard: "In name of The Astral Plains, say them!"

Twortz: *She frowned and tightly held the frying pan, readying herself to sway it.* "Sonic Rush."

*Twortz swayed the frying pan, blowing a scattered shock wave into the air, pushing the platform all the way to the side of the wall.*

Rachael: "You did it!" *She shouted in a victorious-like manner, watching the platform chip away at the wall.*

Twortz: "Sonic Rush?"

Lezard: "Jinkies! What a spin-chilling attack-"

Lucky: "Hyuck!" *He chuckled with his mouth open, listening to the air swirl in his mouth.*

Twortz: (That felt, extraordinary!)

Rachael: "What's happening? I can't see in front of us!"

Lezard: "Umm-" *He shuffled onto his backside and stared ahead, causing him to squeal in fear.*

Twortz: "What appears to be the problem?"

Lezard: "The cave's wall suddenly takes a sharp corner! It's like a wall in front of us."

Rachael: "What does that mean?"

Lucky: "We got splat, hyuck hyuck!"

Twortz: "I'll blow us away from the wall?" *She readjusted the frying pan, readying to sway it.*

Lezard: "No! With your lack of Astragon control, we'll be blasted back and fall down."

Twortz: "Then, what is the correct procedures for us to take?!"

Rachael: (Even in a situation like this-) *Her head bobbed up and down every time the platform hit a bump.* (She sounds so professional.)

Lezard: "I.. Don't know.."

Rachael: *She ignored the pain in her shins and slowly leant up, staring in front in shock.* "Whoa."

Twortz: *She noticed Twortz's stance on the moving platform in confusion.* (Wasn't Rachael light headed? How is she riding this platform so easily-?)

Rachael: "M-Maybe we should lean to the left before we hit the wall?"

Lezard: "Not sure if you've noticed, but we're kind of moving at quite a fast pace, little monster."

Rachael: "But-"

Lucky: "Splat, splat, splat." *He leant to each side, as if he was singing a song.*

Twortz: "What should we do?!"

Rachael: "..."

Lezard: "Brace yourselves?"

Rachael: *She watched the pebbles on the path vibrate, before the platform ran them over.* (I don't know if my memory was hazy because I was filled with adrenalin.. Was I really the one that saved Lezard?)

*Rachael thought to herself in curiosity, triggering a flashback of when the rock pillar shot up, hitting her in mid-air.*

Rachael: (I felt a connection I've never experienced before, but-) "No, what am I thinking? It's not possible."

Lezard: "Okies! Brace yourselves, everyone!"

Lucky: "This will make booboo." *He spoke in worry and closed his naturally squinted eye, preparing himself for a crash.*

Rachael: (That feeling.. It's natural, like feeling fear or excitement..) *She formed fists, staring at the cave wall they were about to smash into.*

*Rachael's body started to glow a shade blue, instantly catching Lezard and Twortz's attention.*

Lezard: "Holy fish-cakes! You know Azure Bursts too-?"

Rachael: (This feeling.. I've got weight on my arms.. It's like, they're moving through sand or dirt-)

*Rachael slowly moved her arms, as if they were buried or in water.*

Rachael: "Kah-?" *She suddenly coughed, as if something was caught in her throat.* "What-?"

Lezard: *He noticed Rachael's discomfort.* "Don't fight that feeling. The throat is where the Neurons and Astragons mix when a new technique is learnt-"

Rachael: "I don't-" *She twitched to the side, causing her to gasp at the wall next to her.* (It felt like it responded to my movement!-)

Lezard: *He focused back in front, tightly crossing his arms over his face.* "This is it-"

Rachael: "Rock Pillar." *She punched to the side, causing a sheet of rock to erupt up, forming a smooth arch around the wall.*

Lucky: "Yay! Fun again, hyuck!" *He smiled in relief, watching the platform slide on the newly formed wall, causing him to lean on one side.*

Twortz: (Smooth?)

Rachael: "Hehe?!" *She smirked at her fist in amazement, as if she was suddenly enjoying the ride.* (It's like a slippery dip at an amusement park, or at Adventure Land in Dee Highs-)

Lezard: "The party rode on an unnaturally flat rock, down a singular path which reached the bottom-" *He spoke with a smile, as he fell into the green mist.*

Lucky: "Yay! We cut heaps of time." *He smiled, clapping his hands.*

Rachael: *She spread her arms and focused, causing the platform to slide down the path in a smooth-like manner.* (I absolutely don't believe this-)

Lezard: (She's even controlling the rock under us from vibrating-)

Lucky: "Lucky can't see, hyuck!"

Twortz: "Sonic Rush." *She shouted with an echoing voice and swayed the frying pan, blowing away the mist.*

Rachael: *She watched the mist in front suddenly sway to the side, revealing the ground.* "We're about to slide across the ground! Brace for a bumpy ride!"

Lezard: "Whaaaa." *He whined in shock.*

Rachael: "Ahhh!"

Lucky: "Weeee."

Twortz: "Hooeee!" *She whined in a sing-like manner, bracing herself.*

----------

Trevour: *He watched the Scoldrant slam its fin into the shield, causing it to crack like glass.* (This Mystic Shield won't be able to last long-)

Champion: *She hobbled up to Trevour, taking a deep breath with urgency.* "I have a plan. Right now, we're too weak to fight a powerful Scoldrant-"

Luna: "W-Wat's them glassy cracky sounds?!" *She twitched in fear, causing Nathan's annoyed frown to turn into an understanding pout.*

Nathan: *He watched Trevour and the champion talk behind the cracked silver shield.* (What's happening over there?)

Trevour: "D-Do you think it will work?"

Champion: "I may not look it, but I've experienced many battles."

Trevour: "Got it-" *He stood up and punched his fists together, causing a brown glyph to form under his feet.*

Scoldrant: "Noel!" *It jabbed its fin-like arm into the cracked shield, causing it to suddenly shatter.*

Champion: "Now! Icy swirls call down upon me, frigid skies grant me power-" *She spoke with an echoing voice, as a blue glyph formed underneath her.*

Trevour: (Okay-) "DUST STORM" *He punched one fist into the air, causing a swirling eruption of sand to blast into the Scoldrant's face.*

Scoldrant: "Noel!-" *It leant back, sneezing out the sand.*

Champion: *She raised her arm and looked up, watching ice explode into materialisation.* "ICICLE EDGE" *She swayed her arm down, blasting thick ice spears down towards the Scoldrant.*

Luna: "Everything is echoin'?" *She continuously tilted her head to each side, trying to decipher the unnatural sounds of the Rostical.*

Trevour: *He intensely stared at the ice spears, watching them plummet directly on top of the Scoldrant.* (That Rostical was incantation boosted-)

*The spears suddenly exploded into miniature glaciers on the Scoldrant's back.*

Scoldrant: "Noell!-" *It wailed in pain.*

Champion: "Oh my, now!"

Trevour: "The aurora lights bend and swirl the gravel into liquid, turn to dust and sand, watch it vacuum your sins-" *He shouted and dropped to the ground, placing both hands on the dirt.*

Nathan: (An incantation!-)

Trevour: "SWIRLING SANDPIT"

*Rings of sand swirled around all four of the Scoldrant's legs, effectively sinking it.*

Nathan: (He's able to sink something that large into the ground!-)

Champion: (I had a feeling he knew an incantation to a Rostical-) *She smiled to herself in thought.*

Trevour: (Excellent. Everything is going to plan-)

Champion: "AQUA LIQUID" *She swayed her arms in a fluid-like manner, causing waves of water to crash around the Scoldrant's feet.*

Nathan: *He watched the Scoldrant continue to sink into the ground.* (I see. The ice on the Scoldrant's back is adding weight-)

Trevour: *He quickly stood up and punched the air above him.* "DUST STORM"

*An erupted of swirling mud-like sand spiralled up the Scoldrant's legs.*

Scoldrant: "Noeeel?!"

Champion: *She cupped her hands and a blue glyph shined underneath her.* "POLAR SNAP"

Trevour: (They're like muddy pillars-)

*Snow swirled and floated around the muddy pillars, instantly freezing them.*

Scoldrant: "Noelll!" *It tried to pull its legs out of the frozen muddy clump.*

Nathan: (It's stuck!) *He thought in shock, watching the Scoldrant struggle to move.*

Champion: *She quickly hobbled around, facing Nathan and Luna.* "Let's go!"

Trevour: *He stared at the Scoldrant in amazement.* (Everything went just as she planned! What a combo!-)

Nathan: "Trevour!"

Trevour: "Oh?" *He faced the party and noticed them running away.* "Coming, sir!"

----------

*Rachael, Twortz, Lezard and Lucky slowly came to a stop, ignoring the swirls of dirt left behind them.*

Lucky: *He hopped off the platform and smiled, clapping his hands in excitement.* "That was fun, hyuck!"

Twortz: "Yeek-" *She quickly rolled off the platform and sighed in relief, brushing dirt off her clothes.*

Rachael: *She smirked and sat on the platform comfortably, taking a satisfying breath of relief.* "Wow."

Lezard: *He awkwardly stood up and brushed his garments, giggling to himself in excitement.* "Wowza indeed, Raz."

Rachael: "Raz? I like it."

Lezard: "Bwarharh, thankies."

Lucky: "Let's do that again!"

Twortz: "..." *She sniffed and placed her hands behind her back, standing in a professional-like manner.*

Lezard: "Not me! I was lucky I didn't poop!"

Twortz: "Excuse me?"

Lucky: "Lucky didn't do?" *He looked over to his backside in confusion.* "Lucky confused?"

Lezard: "Bwarharharh, nothing to worry about, my dear Lucky."

Rachael: "Hehe." *She smiled at Lezard and Lucky's conversation.*

Lucky: "Come, this way!" *He pointed to a cave entrance, before walking towards it.*

Rachael: *She pushed herself up and smirked, staring at Lucky's back.* "Let's go."

Lezard: "Roger!"

Twortz: "Isn't it suspicious that we're following this autistic man deep underground?"

Lezard: "Does it matter what his mental condition is?"

Twortz: "Yes?" *She spoke as if it was an obvious answer.*

Lezard: "How do you trust people?"

Twortz: "..."

Lezard: *He quickly hobbled after Rachael, glancing at her in a curious-like manner.* "Tell me, Razzypoo. How long could you use Remenistal for?"

Rachael: "I'm speechless, really? I could never do that before."

Twortz: (Am I the only one thinking clearly? I don't care how special he is, it's the fact we're following him, deep in an unimaginable place.. We have no idea what his intentions are-)

Rachael: *She started to walk forward, chuckling in disbelief.* "How did I-?"

Lezard: *He hobbled by Rachael's side.* "The technique Rock Pillar, that's a ground-based Remenistal."

Rachael: "And that means Rostical?"

Lezard: "Bravo." *He giggled, enthusiastically shaking his bottom.*

Lucky: "Lucky here." *His voice echoed from within the cave, catching the party's attention.*

Rachael: *She shook her arms and stepped into the cave, listening to their footsteps echo.* "My arms feel really weird."

Lezard: "They're probably not used to the Neurons."

Twortz: *She looked up and sighed, shaking her head.* (As bad as it sounds, I can't leave them.. The walk back up is too great-)

*Twortz sighed again and silently followed the party through the cave, listening to their conversation.*

Rachael: "Could you please explain what Neurons are?"

Lezard: "Neurons, they're like an energy source. Depending on the person's Neuron level, it can determine how strong one's Remenistal, or Rostical is."

Twortz: (So, these Neurons are similar to a battery?)

Rachael: "Does that mean everyone has different levels of Neurons?"

Lezard: "Of course. It's the same reason why we don't all have the same coloured hair and eyes."

Rachael: "So if you got a lot of Neurons, your Rostical becomes much stronger?"

Lezard: "Yes. It's also not Remenistal, everything incorporates Neurons. Neurons can also boost physical attributes."

Rachael: "I don't quite get what it does-"

Lezard: *He shook his head.* "It's easier to understand when I explain both."

Lucky: "Astra-Astragons! Hyuck hyuck." *He giggled and rubbed his ears, leading the party through the tight dark cave.*

Twortz: (Even this autistic man knows what these Neuron things are...)

Lezard: "Exactly right, little monster-"

Lucky: "Rawrr." *He pretended to be a Scoldrant.*

Lezard: "Bwarharh."

Rachael: "Hehe. So, these Astra-Astragons?"

Lezard: "Astragons. These guys are responsible for the manipulation of space."

Rachael: "Wow?"

Lezard: "Neurons may determine the quality of one's power, but Astragons determine the size of one's attack."

Rachael: "Is that all Astragons do?"

Lezard: "It also determines the Rasticsplash of an attack."

Rachael: "What's a Rasticsplash?"

Lezard: "Well.. An example would be-..." *He looked up to the cave walls, staring at bright glowing crystals in thought.* "Ah! Like a fire based Remenistal, the Rasticsplash can determine how burnt you get from the attack."

Rachael: "The flame's heat.. Wouldn't that have something to do with Neurons?"

Lezard: "Jinkies! You catch on fast."

Rachael: "Hehe."

Lezard: "Although that's true, the Rasticsplash is like the aftermath or additional bonuses one can do."

Rachael: "If I had a lot of Neurons, that would mean I could erupt an entire building sized rock?" *She punched her fist up, implying a piece of rock erupted out of the ground.*

Lezard: "Nope. The size of the rock would be determined by your level of Astragons. The Neurons determine how hard the rock would be."

Rachael: "How would that work with water?"

Lezard: *He chuckled in an impressed-like manner.* "Not many people would ask about the other elements. Neurons and Astragons play their respective roles, but are different with each element."

Rachael: "So, water?"

Lezard: "Regarding the water elemental affinity, the Neurons determine how strong the water is, for example, its current."

Rachael: "And the Astragons?"

Lezard: "They determine your ability at controlling the water, and how much you're able to manipulate."

Rachael: "Hehe, that's wicked. Twortz, imagine me using water!"

Twortz: "..."

Lezard: "Unfortunately, not many people can use different elements."

Rachael: "They can't?"

Lezard: "People are very lucky if they're able to use more than one elemental affinity."

Rachael: "Fair enough."

Lezard: "Despite all this. Being born with Neurons or Astragons is very rare."

Rachael: "Oh?"

Lezard: "On top of this, both Neurons and Astragons are needed to be able to use Remenistal."

Rachael: "W-What? If having one is rare, then-"

Lezard: "Rostical Users are very rare to come by."

Rachael: "So, even if you have heaps of Neurons, if you've got no Astragons-"

Lezard: "Then you can't fart out a wind-based Remenistal."

Rachael: "Oh?"

Lezard: "But, you've got Azure Bursts, Ougis, and abilities."

Rachael: "Oh?" *She sounded intrigued, as if she wanted Lezard to explain.*

Twortz: (I'm a realist.. This just isn't possible.) *She continued to walk behind the party, gently touching her temple with a frown.* (It isn't..)

Lezard: "That's why I'm very intrigued about your Remenistal."

Rachael: "How come?"

Lezard: "The lucky rare few that are born with both Neurons and Astragons are aware of it. Some naturally excel in the skill, while others need to be trained up."

Rachael: "Hehe." *She formed a fist, looking at it with a confident smirk.*

Lezard: "It's very unusual how an adult only just activated her power?"

Rachael: *She shrugged her shoulders.* "I don't know what to say-"

Lucky: *He walked out of the cave and smiled in amazement.* "Wow! Lucky amazed! Amazed!"

Lezard: "Ah-" *He hobbled out of the cave and stood by Lucky's side.*

Rachael: *She stopped next to Lucky, slightly squinting her eyes in shock.* "Are we still underground?"

Lucky: "It bright, bright."

Lezard: "The party stood on a grassy field-, ooo! There's even butterflies and flowers." *He observed his surroundings in amazement.*

Twortz: *She noticed she stood on top of an enormous pillar, as the ledges curved downwards.* (I thought we reached the bottom? But I can clearly see the grass growing over the ledges.)

Lezard: *He looked up, squinting his eyes at the light.* "Despite being underground, physical Neurons lit up the cave like sunlight."

Rachael: "If that isn't the sun-"

Twortz: "How can vegetation grow under here? Even artificial light can't sustain flora."

Rachael: (Physical Neurons?) "That's because the light is Neuron filled. Neurons are pretty much an energy source."

Twortz: "What?"

Lezard: "Absolutely right, Razzicle!" *He smiled at Rachael and glanced at Twortz.* "Were you not even listening to Lezard's one-oh-one on Remenistal?"

Twortz: "Regardless, how much further?"

Lucky: "We tried to find friend, he went bad. He sick."

Rachael: "Lucky, how much further?"

Lucky: "Up there." *He pointed to hill with a distinctive dirt path which spiralled around it.*

Lezard: *He noticed flickering light on top of the hill.* (What's up there?)

Rachael: "More walking?"

Twortz: "Perhaps I'll sit this one out."

Rachael: "If you need to-"

Lezard: "That explains a lot of things." *He spoke on his breath, glancing away from Twortz.*

Twortz: *She frowned, gripping onto the frying pan.* "Actually, I just changed my mind. I'll come."

Rachael: "Wicked. As what Ash would say, that's completely acceptable."

Twortz: "Yes."

Lezard: "Shall we make a move on-?" *He looked at the hill, noticing Lucky half way there.* "Holy fish-cakes! The little monster is half way there!"

Rachael: "Come on." *She smirked and started to jog towards Lucky.*

----------

*The champion, Luna, Trevour and Nathan ran down a small grassy slope, instantly noticing a small village in the distance.*

Luna: "M-Magic?!" *She hissed to herself in a trance-like state.*

Champion: "What is wrong with her?" *She slightly changed direction, quickly hobbling towards the village.*

Nathan: "I have no idea.."

Trevour: *He looked over his shoulder, staring at two large distant mountains in the distance.* "We might be out of Sorrowprax's view, but I won't be comfortable until we're under a roof."

Champion: "Oh my, I was going to say something similar."

Luna: "M-Magic..."

Nathan: *He pulled Luna's arm, as she started to slow down.* "We're nearly at the village." *He grunted in an annoyed-like manner, implying for her to hurry up.*

Luna: *She recalled the sounds of the party's previous fight with the Scoldrant.* (All this time.. This is real-)

Champion: "I haven't familiarised myself with backwater villages. Where is this again?"

Trevour: "This is Nikitik Village."

Nathan: (This is near my home-.. I think?)

Champion: "Does anyone have one of those RPG bags?"

Trevour: "They're the bags that can store limitless amount of items without ever expanding or getting heavier, right?"

Champion: "That's the one." *She smiled, continuing to hobble to the village.*

Nathan: "We just broke out of Sorrowprax. Even if we had one, I don't think we would've had the luxury of getting it back."

Luna: "RPG?" (This is real, but these acronyms.. Gah-) *She frowned in confusion.*

Champion: "Do we need a pass or anything like that to enter?"

Trevour: "Negative, miss. It has an Inn and a crafting shop." *He spoke with a smile of relief, listening to the faint sounds of people in the village.*

Nathan: "What about money?"

Trevour: "Leave that to me, sir."

Champion: "Money?" *She whispered to herself, looking at Trevour.* "I'll come too."

Trevour: "Sure thing."

Nathan: *He looked up, noticing the sun had started to set.* "I think we should rest for the night."

Trevour: "Sir?"

Nathan: "I usually prefer to sleep outdoors, but if I have an opportunity to sleep at the Inn, I'll take it."

Luna: "..."

Trevour: "Sounds excellent, sir."

Champion: "We'll get the supplies and you book in a room for us?"

Nathan: "No worries." *He spoke in a deep voice and nodded his head in agreement.*

Trevour: "Excellent." *He slowed down and started to walk in a more casual manner, stepping into the village.*

Nathan: "Why are you slowing down? Shouldn't we do what we gotta do quickly?"

Trevour: "We don't have to worry here. This is one of the few villages where warriors are-"

*A man noticed Trevour and gasped, causing nearby people to bow down to one knee.*

Luna: "I-It got quiet, wat's happenin'?"

Champion: "Oh my?"

Nathan: "They're bowing down to Trevour?"

Trevour: "Fear not! My appearance today is not business or threat related. Please carry on." *He shouted with a smile, causing the villagers to stand back up.*

Champion: "What did you do?"

Trevour: "Since this is the closest village to Sorrowprax, the warrior's have the most influence on them."

Villager A: *She ran up to Trevour, enthusiastically smiling with an opened mouth.* "C-Can I get you anything?"

Trevour: "No thank you, madam."

Villager A: "O-Of course." *She sighed and tilted her head down, slowly shuffling away.*

Trevour: "Sir-" *He caught Nathan's attention and pointed to his right.* "The larger house behind that small water fountain is the Inn."

Nathan: "Thanks." *He nodded his head at the champion and Trevour and started to walk away.* "Oh!"

Trevour: "Yes?"

Nathan: "Can you get me a sword?"

Trevour: "Erhm-?"

Champion: "We'll see what we can do." *She spoke with a high tone of voice, smiling with her eyes shut.*

Nathan: "Great." *He sighed in relief and pulled Luna's arm, causing her to stumble behind him.*

Luna: "Wat is with your fetish in havin' a sword?"

Nathan: "Tssk." *He frowned, purposely ignoring Luna's question.*

Luna: "Nah, I'm serious, aye?"

Nathan: "It's not a fetish."

Luna: "Wateva."

Nathan: *He sighed and walked up to the water fountain, purposely shoving Luna on a wooden bench.* "Stay here."

Luna: *She listened to the water flowing behind her.* "You're pretty harsh on a woman."

Nathan: "I don't care what gender you are."

Luna: "Oh? So, you a girl beater, aye?"

Nathan: "No, that's not what I-" *He shook his head and turned around, storming towards the Inn.*

Luna: *She looked down and raised her hands, waving them in front of her face.* (My eyes.. I still can't see anythin'-)

*Luna thought to herself with quivering lips, oblivious to the passing villagers who stared at her in shock.*

Woman: "Are you alright-?"

Luna: "B-Back off!" *She grunted, causing the woman to suddenly walk away.*

*Luna looked down to her lap, as tears of blood ran down her cheeks.*

Luna: (My eyes constantly hurt. I don't know where the hell I am, and there's all this unrealistic shit goin' on..)

*The sounds of a wooden door opening caught Luna's attention.*

Nathan: "I was able to get two rooms." *He waited for a carriage to wheel by before walking towards Luna.*

Luna: *She sniffed and quickly wiped the blood off her eyes.* "Good."

Nathan: "Tomorrow..-" *He sat down on the wooden bench next to Luna, looking up to the orange sky.* "I've been thinking about you lately."

Luna: "Y-You wat?"

Nathan: "Huh?" *He mumbled in realisation.* "I-I didn't mean like that."

Luna: *She looked away with blushing cheeks.* "Good. I don't even know what you look like, aye."

Nathan: "I was thinking.."

Luna: "Don't hurt yourself, aye."

Nathan: "No, I'm serious.. "You don't really know how things work around here, right?"

Luna: "Yea, sure. It's pretty tough bein' an alien."

Nathan: *He paused, raising an eyebrow.* "I'll escort you to Silver Wind Island."

Luna: "Aye?"

Nathan: "Silver Wind Island is the biggest city across both continents."

Luna: "If it's the biggest city, why haven't I heard of it?"

Nathan: "..."

Luna: "Well, why?"

Nathan: "You'll get answers there. Its research facility also contains The Library's archives."

Luna: "You know quite a lot for someone with an apparent memory loss, aye."

Nathan: "I remember facts, but I don't remember much about myself.."

Luna: "Gah.." *She sighed on her breath, causing Nathan to look confused.*

Nathan: "What is it now?"

Luna: ".. Thanks.."

Nathan: "Ah? You're welcome?"

Luna: "..." *She looked back down and sniffed, staring at her lap with a mature facial expression.* "About my question before. Did you used to fence?"

Nathan: "Fence?"

Luna: "That's what my bro used to do. Somethin' to do with swords?"

Nathan: "Oh?" *He mumbled in realisation, slowly nodding his head.*

----------

*Trevour and the champion stood in front of a house with a pub-like booth on the front.*

Trevour: "Greetings?"

Craftsman: "Hello?" *He walked to the side and leant off the counter with one arm, looking at Trevour.* "What can I get ya today?"

Trevour: "I'd like fourteen Acro Berries please."

Craftsman: "Yes." *He nodded his head and looked behind the counter, as if there were many cabinets.*

Champion: "Also, one Ambrosia Flower."

Trevour: "An Ambrosia Flower? They're expensive and rare!"

Champion: "Do you have one?"

Craftsman: "We've got-" *He scanned to each side, before grunting to himself.* "Two."

Trevour: "Well, could we also have something that boosts affinities?"

Craftsman: "I have wind resistant bangles, fireproof rings and boots which increase speed."

Trevour: "Interesting."

Champion: "What are the item's attributes?"

Trevour: (From the confidence in her tone, she's done this before?)

Craftsman: "Bangles, minus five percent on wind. Rings, minus seven percent on fire and boots, a massive six percent increase in speed."

Champion: "What kind of swords to you have as well?"

Craftsman: "I like doing business, but why do you need this stuff?"

Champion: "Well, I...-"

Trevour: "I've been summoned for an important mission and require these items."

Craftsman: "Oh, why didn't ya say so? I've got wooden, steel and carbon-based swords."

Champion: "Any attributes?"

Craftsman: "Unfortunately not. These are just ordinary swords."

Champion: "A carbon based sword please."

Craftsman: "No worries! Can I get ya anything else?"

Trevour: "If it's possible, I'd like to take them all."

Craftsman: "Take them all? All the items you requested?" *He sounded as if they were expensive.*

Trevour: "Yes. You can subtract the funds on the warrior's next tax?"

Champion: (Sneaky-)

Craftsman: *He nodded his head at Trevour.* "I only have one boot in stock. Four necklaces and two bangles remaining."

Trevour: "Fine by me, sir."

Craftsman: "All warriors get a discount. Unfortunately, the Ambrosia Flower will need to be paid upfront, due to its rarity."

Trevour: *He felt around his armour.* (My pouch! I must've left it at Sorrowprax!-)

Champion: "Will this be enough?" *She placed down several gold stones on the counter, causing the Craftsman to eagerly nod his head.*

Trevour: (Where did she obtain such wealth?)

Craftsman: "That will just about cover it, even without the warrior's discount."

Trevour: "I would be happy to pay you back-"

Champion: "Oh my. No need." *She smiled.* "If I chose to walk alone, I would've had to deal with the Scoldrant all by myself."

Trevour: "Heh heh. No worries-"

Craftsman: *He wrapped the sword up, gently giving it to Trevour.* "Anything else?"

Champion: "Would you happen to have the RPG bag?"

Craftsman: "Norhorhor-" *He laughed with a snort, shaking his head at the champion.* "We wouldn't possess something like that in a backwater village."

Champion: "It didn't hurt to ask." *She smiled with her eyes shut and grabbed a large sack from the counter.*

Trevour: "Thank you for your cooperation, sir."

Craftsman: *He watched Trevour and the champion walk away, causing him to wave his hand out.* "Pleasure doing business with ya."

----------

Nathan: "I don't know what happened back in Sorrowpax, but I can tell you. I, for some reason know I'm really good with a sword."

Luna: "But magic.." *She grunted with a chuckle, as if she found using the word funny.* "Magic will shit all over your damned sword."

Nathan: "You mean Rostical?"

Luna: "Rostickal?" *She spoke like an idiot.* "Yes.."

Nathan: "It took me years, but I learnt how to do some Azure Bursts."

Luna: "What are Azure Burks?"

Nathan: *He smiled, knowing Luna couldn't see him.* (Now she wants to listen-)

Luna: "I'm waiting."

Nathan: "They're special techniques one can use."

Luna: "So, pretty much mag-.. Rostickal, aye?"

Nathan: "Not really. Azure Bursts are majority weapon based, but skilful people can use them without a weapon."

Luna: "Listenin'."

Nathan: "Depending on the person, even if they knew Rostical, Azure Bursts could be stronger."

Luna: "Wat's stronger than shittin' out ice?"

Nathan: "Ahhh, I don't think that's a Rostical-"

Luna: "Don't be a loser and continue tellin' me this."

Nathan: *He looked puzzled, slowly smirking to himself.* "Some Scoldrants are more weakened to physical attacks, while some even nullify Rostical or some elements completely."

Luna: "Dude, this is totally out of a game, aye."

Nathan: "When fighting, it's definitely no game."

Luna: "Gah, wateva." *She waved her hand, implying for Nathan to continue.*

Nathan: "Well, I'll be able to actually defend myself once I have the weapon I've spent years training with."

Luna: "Why not pick up a branch or somethin'?"

Nathan: "I've actually tried that at one point."

Luna: "And?"

Nathan: "The Neurons I instinctively put into my weapon blew it up."

Luna: "OK?"

Nathan: *He tilted his head back and grabbed Luna's hand, causing her to feel small red scars on the side of his neck.* "The splinters left behind some awesome reminders not to do it again."

Luna: "Shit.." *She whispered on her breath, withdrawing her hand back into her lap.*

Trevour: "Hope we weren't long, heh heh." *He awkwardly chuckled, throwing the sword at Nathan.*

Nathan: *He caught the wrapped up sword, staring at it in amazement.* "Awesome!"

Trevour: "Courtesy of the champion here."

Nathan: "Wow, I was a little worried getting a sword without money, so thank you!" *He spoke in respect, slowly unravelling the dirty cloth around the sword.*

Champion: "Oh my, you're welcome." *She smiled with her eyes shut and slightly bowed in respect.*

Trevour: *He looked up, staring at the orangey red sky in amazement.* "The sunset looks beautiful."

Luna: "Yea, I like the purple shadowing around the red."

Trevour: "You do? Where-?" *He looked down, noticing Luna staring at the ground in a blind-like manner.*

Luna: "How embarrassin'."

Trevour: "..."

Champion: "We've got all we need."

Nathan: "Any Acro Berries?"

Champion: "The maximum we can hold with a poor bag."

Nathan: "Twenty?"

Champion: "Yes."

Trevour: "Were you able to find rooms for us?"

Nathan: "Two rooms."

Champion: *She smiled and awkwardly placed her hands on her back, trying to stretch her massive hunchback.* "I think it's time to reside inside."

Nathan: "Alright." *He stood up like a child, as if he was really happy about the sword and glanced at Luna.* "Trevour, she's all yours."

Luna: *She frowned in response.* "Trevour, she's all yours." *She spoke like an ogre, causing Trevour to chuckle.*

Nathan: "Say what you want. I'm in a happy mood." *He continued to smile at the sword and quickly picked up a rock which was placed near the Inn's door.*

Champion: "Isn't that used for keeping the door open?"

Nathan: "I'll return it tomorrow."

Trevour: "Madam?" *He reached down and held Luna's elbow, causing her to hit it away.*

Luna: "I'm fine." *She grunted and arrogantly stood up.* "I'm not disabled or anythin'."

*Luna hissed under her breath and started to walk away, causing Trevour to awkwardly cough to catch her attention.*

Trevour: "Madam, this Inn was directly in front of where you were sitting."

Luna: "Gah! Just take me there." *She spoke in a defeated-like manner and purposely pointed her elbow out, allowing Trevour to grab it.*

----------

Lezard: "So, the luxurious Lezard, ravaging Razzypoo, luscious Lucky and terrible Twortz walked up the spiral hill, eagerly awaiting to find Lucky's friend."

Rachael: "Lucky, why were you down here?"

Lucky: "My friend and I are Soul Linked, we become good friends, hyuck hyuck."

Twortz: (Soul Linked?)

Lezard: "Does that mean you're a Scoldrant User?"

Lucky: *He giggled, touching his ears by habit.* "We went to find bird. Bird was friendly. He attacked us when he sick."

Lezard: "Sick?"

Lucky: "Eyes. They went scary." *He waved his fingers around his eyes, emphasising his story.*

Rachael: "Like, bloodshot scary?"

Twortz: "Are we talking about a bird or his friend?"

Lucky: "Yellow. Scary."

Lezard: "Yellow eyes?" *He spoke to himself, suddenly frowning in a serious-like manner.*

Rachael: "Either way, we're almost up there."

Twortz: *She looked down, noticing she was up very high.* (I'm not sure why I'm blaming Rachael's rather rash and immature views on helping people. I could've said no any time I wanted.)

Lucky: "You use Rostical, help Lucky and friend!" *He slowly reached the top of the hill and bent down, as if he was hiding from something.*

Rachael: "I don't exactly know what's happening, or how I did it-" *She ducked behind Lucky, forming a fist with a smile.* "But I'll do my best to help someone that needs it."

Lezard: *He popped his head up, slowly looking to each side.* "As Lezard looked up-"

Twortz: "Why is everyone ducking their heads? What are we hiding from?"

Lezard: "Shh, I'm searching-"

Twortz: "What do you see?!" *She hissed under her breath, causing Lezard to bend back down.*

Lezard: "Nothing. But I can sense something-"

Twortz: "If there's nothing up here-" *She stood up and glared at Lucky while walking on top of the hill.* "Right. Nothing. We've been played."

Lucky: "Lucky wants you to be careful-"

Twortz: "Careful of what?! The air?!"

*Rachael and Lezard stood up and cautiously stepped on top of the hill, glancing to each side.*

Twortz: "See, nothing."

Lucky: "Where are you?" *He shouted and stood up, hesitantly stepping onto the hill.*

?????: "G-Kark!" *A loud bubbling-like roar came from the shadows.*

Lezard: *He quickly turned around, facing the darkness.* (That was a Scoldrant for sure-)

Lucky: "There he is! Help! He stuck on wall!"

Rachael: "On the wall? Whereabouts, Lucky?"

Lucky: *He skipped up to Rachael and pointed with his body towards a specific part of the darkness.* "There! Right there!"

Rachael: (Okay, here it goes!-) *She formed fists and pushed forward.*

Twortz: "What could you possibly hope to do-?"

Rachael: "Harhhh!" *She shouted and enthusiastically withdrew her arms to her chest.*

Lezard: *He listened to stone-like cracks come from the walls, causing him to step back.* "Did that do it?"

Rachael: *She lowered her arms, shaking her head.* "That's the best I can do. I don't know how to do it yet."

Lezard: "It's okay, little monster. It can take years to even have a visible manifestation of Remenistal."

Lucky: "No, you crack, it good!"

Rachael: "It is?"

?????: "Kark-karkikiki-"

*The walls cracked further, causing boulders to tumble down towards the ground.*

Twortz: (I don't like this-) *She frowned and raised her frying pan, standing in a battle-ready pose.*

Lezard: "Lucky, is that your friend making those scary sounds? Or is Twortz being all serious again?"

Twortz: "Seriously?" *She glared at Lezard, keeping her professional-like composure and stature.*

*An explosion burst a pile of rocks off the wall Rachael focused towards.*

Twortz: "Did something just-"

*A large sea creature fell from the air and landed heavily on the hill, causing it to vibrate under the party's feet.*

?????: "Karki!-"

Twortz: "W-Wharrck?!" *She stared at the creature with widening eyes, readying to attack.*

Rachael: (A human-sized crab with octopus tentacles?!)

Twortz: (It must've jumped off the wall from all the way over there-)

Lezard: "And this must be your friend, Lucky." *He spoke with a smile, causing Rachael and Twortz to look at him in shock.*

Rachael: "What are you saying?"

Lucky: "I got help like you said. Hyuck, hyuck." *He chuckled and ran towards the creature, causing Twortz to gasp in shock.*

Twortz: "Don't touch it! It's hideous!"

Scoldrant: "Korkk?" *It looked at Twortz and snapped its pincers.*

Lucky: "You hurt Whaka-Rangi's feeling!"

Whaka: "Korkk!"

Lucky: "Is sick still here?"

Whaka: "Korikikii." *It slithered its tentacles, as if it was talking to Lucky.*

Rachael: "His friend is a creature-"

Lezard: "Not a creature, a Scoldrant."

Twortz: (My head! I can't handle this-)

Lucky: "Whaka say sick is still-"

?????: "Skra! Who darh enterhs myh domayn?" *A voice which sounded like burning wood echoed in the area.*

Rachael: "Who was that?" *She spun around in shock, trying to spot who spoke.*

Twortz: "Was that the sea monster?"

Lucky: "Whaka no monster!"

Rachael: "I don't think it was."

Lezard: (Those Neuron signatures!-) "Brace yourselves, little monsters!"

Twortz: "..." *She tried to hide her confusion, purposely ignoring Whaka.*

*A red bird with a long rainbow coloured tail flew directly up, catching the entire party's attention.*

Lezard: "That looks like a scary Scoldrant." *He stared directly above him, watching the Scoldrant latch onto the ceiling.*

Rachael: "Scary? It looks like a beautiful phoenix."

Whaka: "Kikiikikok."

Lucky: "Whaka say, it uses Rostical!"

Lezard: "Jinkies, a Rostical Using Scoldrant?"

Scoldrant: *It looked down at the party, staring at them with eerie yellow coloured eyes.* "You all whill dhie!"

Rachael: "Are its eyes meant to glow like that?"

Twortz: "How would you know?!"

Rachael: "Reason I ask is because it looks so unnatural."

Lezard: "I happen to agree with you, Razzypoo-"

Scoldrant: *It spread its wings, alerting the party.* "Endurh dheath!"

Lezard: "How strong are you, Lucky?"

Lucky: "Me and Whaka will become Guardians soon."

Lezard: *He hobbled back, while keeping a fixated stare on the Scoldrant.* (He may not exactly be at that level, but he's probably strong enough if they're going to become a Guardian-)

Lucky: *He stared at the bird with widening eyes, causing a purple ring to spiral around his iris.* "Watch out!-"

Scoldrant: "Eeeeeeerkh." *It dived down and flapped its wings, swooping directly towards the party.*

Rachael: "Rock Pillar." *She stood in a battle-ready pose and swayed her arm to the side, blasting a small boulder into the Scoldrant's side.*

Scoldrant: "Yhou!-" *It awkwardly flapped away from the hill and glided through the air, circling the party.*

Rachael: *She held her arm in pain.* (I'm not exhausted, but my arm hurts.. It feels like I've been training all day-)

Scoldrant: "FLAME BOLT" *It opened its orange beak and whistled out four fireballs directly towards the party.*

Twortz: (We're all cluttered!-) "Sonic Rush." *She shouted with an echoing voice and swayed her frying pan like a baseball bat, blowing a scattered shock wave in front.*

Lucky: "Whaka!"

Whaka: "BUBBLE BLAST" *It suddenly blew out faint blue bubbles towards the fireballs.*

*Four miniature explosions brightly lit up the cave, as the bubbles and shock wave intercepted the fireballs.*

Lezard: "Delicious work!"

Scoldrant: *It faced the party and leant up, revealing its yellow feathered stomach.* "FLAMING WHEEL"  *It flapped its wings, blowing a tornado-like spiral of bright red flames towards Whaka.*

Lucky: "No!-"

Whaka: "Kork-?!"

Rachael: "Twortz!" *She quickly ran towards Lucky and leapt forward, tackling him out of the way.*

Twortz: (She really does move like an athlete-) *She waddled with a loss of breath.*

Whaka: *It watched Twortz waddle in front, facing the incoming spiral of flames.* "Korki?!"

Twortz: "Sonic Rush!" *She screamed at the flames and swayed the frying pan across, blowing out a scattered shock wave in front.*

*The flames suddenly exploded past Twortz, instantly burning the small vegetation on the hill.*

Rachael: "Twortz!" *She shouted out in a worried-like manner.*

Lezard: (That was strong! I can feel the warmth from here-)

Scoldrant: *It spiralled downwards, continuing to circle around the hill.* "I whill keep incrheasing powerh!"

*The smoke cleared, revealing Twortz standing in front of Whaka with burns on her arms.*

Twortz: "H-How can it talk?" *She watched steam sizzle from the slightly red frying pan.*

Lezard: (Oh my-) "Quick healing shot, HEALING IMPLOSION"

*Light glowed in Twortz's burns, queuing it to start rapidly healing, causing flakes of dried skin to fall off her healed wounds.*

Twortz: (Amazing-)

Rachael: *She quickly stood up and formed fists, standing in a battle-ready pose.* (It has the advantage.)

Lezard: *He quickly hobbled around the hill, purposely staying on the opposite side away from the Scoldrant.* "I believe Twortz should conserve her Neurons and use her Azure Burst as a defensive-"

Scoldrant: "Yhou whill bhurn to ashhh!" *It flew closer to the hill, as if it was readying to attack.*

Twortz: (For defensive purposes? Sounds logical.) *She stared at the Scoldrant, while listening to Lezard.*

Lezard: "Razzypoo and Luckymottus, focus on your attacks and try to knock him out of the air."

Rachael: "Would that actually do any damage?"

Lucky: "Flying Scoldrant knocked out of air, they go crash!" *He straightened his hand and dived it down, suddenly spreading his fingers for an explosion.*

Rachael: "Well then-" *She once again straightened her arms and punched towards the Scoldrant, blasting boulders directly towards it.*

Lezard: (If she wasn't lying, she's a natural at using Remenistal.)

*Lucky watched the Scoldrant casually glide past the boulders, as they smashed into the wall behind it.*

Rachael: (I keep missing!-)

Whaka: "BUBBLE BLAST" *It blew out several bubbles towards the Scoldrant.*

Twortz: (I can't believe I'm going to participate in this nonsense-) "Rachael, throw your projectiles in front of the bird's flying path."

Rachael: "Ah, right!" *She nodded her head and punched away from the Scoldrant, blasting a boulder into the air.*

Scoldrant: "I whill fhinish this!-" *A boulder hit it across the face, causing it to spiral back in a violent manner.*

Lezard: "Jinkies! A direct hit-"

Scoldrant: *Its eyes glowed brighter, allowing it to suddenly zigzag through the air, directly towards Rachael.* "Fire Stroke." *Its talons suddenly engulfed in flames, as it readied to scratch Rachael.*

Rachael: "Rock Pillar." *She swayed her arms and punched upwards, shooting two boulders at the Scoldrant.*

Lucky: "Use best attack!" *He shouted, enthusiastically pointing at the bird.*

Whaka: *It crawled to the side like a crab and concentrated, causing a blue glyph to form under its feet.* "Korkikiki."

Scoldrant: *It dived through the boulders, ignoring the damage caused by it.* "Dhie!"

Rachael: (It just smashed!-) *She leant back, staring at the blazing talons with widening eyes.* "No!-"

Twortz: "Sonic Rush." *She shouted and swayed the frying pan forward with enthusiasm, causing her to trip on her own movement.*

Lezard: "Huh-?" *He watched Twortz fall to the ground, as she lined her attack with the incoming Scoldrant.*

Twortz: "No!-" *The frying pan hit the ground and made a deafening sound, erupting a shock wave into the hill.*

Lucky: "Ergh!-" *He covered his ears like a child.* "Loud-"

*The end of the hill suddenly exploded shards of rock at the Scoldrant, causing it to screech in pain.*

Scoldrant: "How dhare-" *It fell beak first into the hill, sliding along the grass.*

Rachael: "Rock Pillar." *She swayed her arms and punched to the side, causing a rock pillar to throw her across to the other side of the hill.*

Twortz: (My wrist!-)

Lezard: (The sound.. The shock wave, it makes sense now-)

Lucky: "Whaka-Rangi! Hyuck hyuck! I believe in you!"

Whaka: *Golden strings swayed out of its body, before suddenly shooting into Lucky.* "Kiss the rain-"

Lucky: "A-Ahgh?!" *His hair slightly changed into a honey colour.*

Whaka: "WATER STORM" *An erupted of water blasted the Scoldrant into the air.*

Lucky: "Lucky and Whaka sorry, friend." *He spoke with sadness, watching the Scoldrant fall back towards the hill.*

Scoldrant: *Its eyes changed into a natural black-like colour before hitting the hill.* "My eyhes? Lhyucky, Whakah, shorry.."

Whaka: "Korkkikiii."

Scoldrant: "I agreeh... Yhou know what to dho."

Rachael: *She slowly stood up, ignoring the grass burns on her arm.* "..."

Lezard: *He silently stared at the Scoldrant, watching a faint puff of dirt swirl around it.* (The Scoldrant's Neurons have significantly dropped-)

Twortz: "It's like they're talking?" *She waddled up to Rachael and Lezard.*

Lezard: "They probably are.."

Lucky: *He looked down, kicking the hill in sadness.* "Lucky doesn't want to-"

Whaka: "Kork!"

Scoldrant: "Yhou mhust!"

Lucky: *He slowly nodded his head and turned around, staring at Whaka with watering eyes.* "Ougi..."

Whaka: "Ougi.." *Its words caused the blue glyph around it to become three-dimensional.*

Rachael: *Her eyes watered.* "What's happening?"

Lezard: "There's been a new disease.. Well, not new, but recently more active-"

Twortz: "Disease?!" *She quickly looked at Lezard in an urgent-like manner.*

Lezard: "It's been happening in Scoldrants, but a few people have received this condition too. It essentially improves the user's power, at the cost of becoming aggressive and out of character."

Lucky: "All your power!"

Whaka: "HYDRO CANNON" *It suddenly spurted out a high pressured blast of water into the Scoldrant, causing the hill to explode around it.*

Twortz: *She felt the sprinkles of water touch her on the face.* "There's got to be gallons.."

*The stream of water pushed the Scoldrant off the hill and through the air, slamming it into the cave's wall, exploding chunks of rock around it.*

Lezard: "I felt that throughout the whole area-"

Lucky: *He turned around and pouted, tightly hugging Whaka.* "Lucky sad."

Rachael: "..."

Twortz: *She watched the water splash on to the ground, leaving swirls of white orbs which slowly floated into the air.* "What are those orbs? And where did the bird's body go?"

Lezard: "It died.." *He spoke in a slow, caring-like manner.*

Rachael: "Huh?"

Lucky: "Yhurk.." *He pouted and sniffed, causing Whaka to comfort him with its tentacles.*

Lezard: "When creatures with enough Neurons or Astragons passes away, their body becomes physical Neurons, which we call Roharnia.."

Rachael: "Roharnia.."

Lezard: "Need I say more?"

Rachael: *She slowly shook her head and noticed something shimmer above her.* "No-.." *She replied to Lezard and reached up, watching a red feather float into her hand.*

Lezard: "What have you got there?"

Rachael: "A feather from the Scoldrant?"

Twortz: *She lowered the frying pan and placed her hands behind her back.* "It would appear so."

Lezard: "Ahem-" *A white glyph drew itself under his feet.* "Quick internal light, INVOKING AURA"

*A swirl of warm light flashed around Twort'z wrist, healing her wounds.*

Twortz: (The pain? How did he-?)

Lezard: "Quick healing shot, HEALING IMPLOSION"

*Light glowed in the graze mark across Rachael's arm, queuing it to start rapidly healing.*

Rachael: "Awesome!" *She smiled in appreciation, twirling the red feather in her fingers.*

Lezard: "Phew."

Rachael: "Lucky, are you okay?"

Lucky: *He stepped away and slowly nodded his head.* "Lucky fine."

Whaka: "Korkikiki." *It suddenly disintegrated into tiny blue orbs, swirling into Lucky's arm.*

Lucky: *He watched a blue tribal glyph burn into his flesh.* "Good to have Whaka-Rangi back, hyuck."

Twortz: "What happened? The creature is gone?"

Lezard: "You'd have to ask an actual Scoldrant User about their abilities, but I think when they reach a certain level, the user can materialise their partner at will."

Twortz: *She frowned.* "So why didn't he materialise his partner off the wall?"

Lucky: "Friend's Neurons blocked Lucky's request."

Twortz: "Oh.."

Rachael: *She glanced at Lezard, noticing a cut on the side of his neck.* "You're hurt, Lezard?"

Lezard: "Ouchies?" *He felt around his neck, shrugging his shoulders as if he didn't care.*

Lucky: "Ouchies, hyuck hyuck." *He chuckled and clapped his hands, walking towards Lezard.*

Lezard: "You're getting much better at using your Remenistal!"

Rachael: "Thanks.. Although, I feel like I've hardly tapped into its power?"

Lezard: (That's because you haven't.. What you can do is a far cry from what captains can do.)

Twortz: *She discreetly stared at Rachael in disgust.* (That's not really you... You imitator-)

Rachael: "Twortz?"

Twortz: "I'm fine." *She pretended to smile and looked around.* "Do we have to walk back?"

Lucky: *He sniffed and shook his head.* "Same glyph at end."

Lezard: "Splendid! Let's get going, little monsters?"

Lucky: "Rawr! Hyuck, hyuck."

Rachael: "Hehe."

Lucky: "Lucky show you way, but Lucky stay."

Rachael: "You won't be coming?"

Lucky: *He shook his head like a child.* "Lucky needs to wait for Ernest. Ernest help."

Lezard: "As much as I don't feel comfortable leaving you here, knowing that you've got such a powerful and respectful Scoldrant, I can put my mind to rest."

Lucky: *He looked down and placed one arm across his chest, as if he was listening to something.* "Whaka wants you to have good luck on trip." *He smiled and started to rub his ears by habit.*

Rachael: "Naw.." *She looked down, noticing the red feather in her hand.* "Here, take this, Lucky."

Lucky: "Feather? Lucky confused." *He started to rock back and forth.*

Rachael: "This feather will bring you luck."

Lucky: "Like Lucky's name?"

Rachael: "Hehe, yeah!" *She giggled, giving Lucky the red feather.* "It's something to remember us by."

Lucky: *He twirled the red feather in his fingers.* "Hyuck, hyuck!" *He chuckled in excitement, gently stroking the feather like a child.*

Lezard: (Naww, that's sweet.)

Twortz: (How time-consuming..) *She sighed in thought and looked away, as if she wanted to leave.*

Lucky: *He bent down and placed his hand on the ground, causing the grass to glow.* "Lucky asked envirement, envirement will help you."

Rachael: "The environment will, what-?" *She noticed the line suddenly travel further into the cave, causing her to gasp in amazement.*

Lezard: "Well, looks like that's the way out."

Lucky: "Thank you." *He smiled and started to walk backwards, as if he was saying farewell to the group.*

Rachael: "We'll always remember you-"

Lezard: "And Whaka!"

Rachael: "Hehe, yeah!" *She started to walk down the spiral path, closely following the glowing line.*

Lezard: "Bye, Luckymottus!" *He spoke with a giggle and wiggled his bottom.*

Twortz: "Farewell." *She spoke in a professional-like manner, slowly following Rachael and Lezard down the path.*

----------

*Nathan, Trevour, Luna and the champion made themselves comfortable in one room, listening to the crickets buzz outside.*

Luna: "I can't believe I'm from another world..."

Trevour: "I'd really like to eat some of these burgers you talk about, heh heh."

Champion: "Oh my, everything about this is something out of a child's fairytale."

Luna: "Nah, this is the fairytale, aye."

Nathan: *He placed the sword across his lap and scraped the rock across its edges, listening to the party's conversation.* "Luna Lighten, Trevour Meister.. And..?"

Champion: "Please, I've been called the champion for many decades now."

Nathan: "And...?"

Champion: "Champion should be fine-"

Luna: "It's just a freakin' name, just bloody answer it, aye."

Trevour: "Luna..."

Luna: "Pssht, Luna me." *She grunted on her breath and looked away from the champion's general direction in an annoyed-like manner.*

Champion: "My name reminds me of my past..." *She shook her head, as if she didn't want to talk about it.* "I'm more curious about your Rostical, Trevour."

Trevour: "Madam?"

Champion: "How is it you're able to manipulate sand, but not solid ground?"

Luna: (Epic way to change the conversation.)

Trevour: *He looked down, rubbing a part of his armour in recollection.* "I've just been able to do so."

Champion: "Oh?"

Luna: "I think it's awesome from wat I've heard.."

Trevour: "R-Really?" *He sounded surprised, causing Luna to chuckle like he was an idiot.*

Luna: "Yea!"

Champion: "And you, Luna?"

Luna: "Aye?"

Champion: "I'm not sure if any of you noticed, but there was one person that was not sweating in the Purity Zone."

Nathan: "Certainly wasn't me. I felt the lack of Neuron and Astragon bonding." *He chuckled in a deep voice, continuing to scrape the rock against the sword's edges.*

Champion: "It was Luna."

Luna: "Aye?"

Champion: "Everyone is affected by the Purity Zone by some degree."

Luna: "I dunno. Maybe it's 'cause I'm not from around here?"

Champion: "Perhaps." *She smiled with her eyes closed.*

Trevour: "While we're asking questions. Could I please enquire about your hunchback, champion?"

Nathan: "Is it a birth defect?"

Champion: "Oh my.. No.. It's just another reminder of my past.."

Luna: "Gah! Don't go about leavin' bread crumbs to more questions."

Nathan: "Hmmm." *His stomach rumbled.*

Trevour: "Wow, you're still hungry? We just ate."

Nathan: "Ha, I just love my food."

Trevour: "Heh heh.. Well, that was a satisfying talk, everyone?"

Champion: "Oh my, it sure was." *She spoke in her high tone of voice.*

Nathan: "Well, it's good to know you guys aren't crazy."

Luna: (Even after talkin' to these dipshits for a few hours.. I still feel like-) *She discreetly pinched her arm, trying to get a reaction.* (I'm just gonna wake up from this crazy vivid dream.)

Champion: "What are your plans for tomorrow?"

Nathan: "Well, I'm going to take Luna to Silver Wind Island. Maybe she'll get answers there?"

Champion: "It does have access to The Library's informative archives."

Luna: "Wat 'bout you'se?"

Champion: "I will temporarily reside at The Twilight Forest once things have cooled down."

Luna: "Wat about you, Rusty?" *She looked in Trevour's general direction.*

Trevour: "I actually have nowhere to go right now.. So, I'll think about it on a good night's rest."

Luna: "Fairo."

Trevour: "And after you drop Luna over here, off. What will you do then?"

Nathan: *He momentarily paused, as if he wasn't going to answer.* "I'm actually trying to find the reason why so many Scoldrants have suffered from the yellow-eyed syndrome."

Luna: "Aye?"

Trevour: "I've heard about this. This is where their eyes glow a yellow?"

Nathan: "Yeah."

Trevour: *He nodded his head, rubbing a smudge off his shoulder armour.* "Even some warriors have fallen ill to the disease."

Champion: "Oh my?" *She tilted her head in curiosity.*

Trevour: "It's a Neuronic disorder. I don't know much about it. The Consultants terminate any warrior completely out of the ranks once discovering they have the illness."

Nathan: "Regardless. I want to stop it from spreading any more."

Trevour: "Your goal is to stop this illness.. Does this have something to do with your background?"

Nathan: "I merely come from Scoldrant Users. I am not one.."

Trevour: "No problem, sir. Heh heh."

Nathan: (Even if I wanted to talk about my background, I can't really remember personal details about my past.)

Luna: (I still think they're all dipshits.. But, hearin' their stories. They've actually got a lot going on themselves-)

Champion: "If we're heading towards Silver Wind Island, we've got a long walk ahead of us." *She stood up off the bed and waddled towards Luna, readying to help her up.*

Trevour: *He reached around his wrist, causing his arm armour to suddenly clip open.* "I'd have to agree."

Luna: *She felt the champion's hand touch her shoulder, causing her to reach up.* "Wat? How far is this island thingy?"

Champion: "It will take the entire day."

Luna: "Wat?!"

Trevour: "Yes. Sometimes on a few missions, we take two days."

Luna: "Shit.."

Champion: "Your choice of words is-.. Unusual?" *She spoke with a smile, keeping an innocent frame of mind.*

Luna: "Wateva." *She stood up and swayed to each side, causing the champion to support her balance.*

Nathan: *He continued to silently scrape the rock along the sword's edges.* "..."

Trevour: "I'll see you ladies, tomorrow." *He stood up and escorted the champion and Luna out of the room, gently closing the door behind them.*

Nathan: "Why exactly are you helping us?"

Trevour: *He turned around, facing Nathan surprised.* "Oh? Like I said, sir, I just don't agree on their ways."

Nathan: "Hmm."

Trevour: "If you don't mind me asking something?" *He shuffled to the other single bed he sat on and raised his foot, unbuckling his armour-like boots.*

Nathan: "Go for it." *He spoke with a lack of concentration, as he focused more on the sword.*

Trevour: "You said not to categorise you with a title."

Nathan: "What about it?"

Trevour: "What do you mean?"

Nathan: *He sighed in accomplishment and started to wrap up the sword, looking to the other side of the room.* "You really want to know?"

Trevour: "Yes."

Nathan: *He leant back and lay on his back, staring at the ceiling.* "It's equality."

Trevour: "Equality?" *He took off his chest plate and suddenly collapsed on his stomach, breathing through the pillow.*

Nathan: "I've encountered many people that use their titles for their own advantage.. Sexism, respect and image, all these have a larger impact on titles."

Trevour: "How does sexism, respect and image got to do with titles?"

Nathan: "Just because you're a captain of- I don't care, doesn't mean I'm gonna bow down and give you my respect."

Trevour: "I see.." *He tilted his head to the side, allowing him to speak normally.*

Nathan: "Image.. You need to earn respect and make an image for yourself, not just rely on some title given to you."

Trevour: "But not all titles are given, and some are actually used just to categorise something. Like, you use a sword, a sword wielder-"

Nathan: "That's exactly what I get frustrated over. If you're a sword user, it doesn't mean I can only fight in the sword arts-"

Trevour: "So you know something else?"

Nathan: "Well, no.. But that's not the point."

Trevour: "Right, sir. Please continue."

Nathan: "Sexism, not that there are many reasons to hit someone, but just because of their gender, it doesn't suddenly mean they're weak defenceless creatures."

Trevour: "No, sir. A man should never hit a woman-"

Nathan: "So you think women are lower than men?"

Trevour: "Of course not-"

Nathan: "So why should you not treat them-"

Trevour: "Like a man? Because they're not, sir."

Nathan: "I was actually going to say, equals."

Trevour: "Equals?"

Nathan: "You're not treating them as equals if you have to act differently towards them."

Trevour: (I.. Never saw it from that perspective before-) *He rubbed his eyes in a tired-like manner.* "So, you'll treat someone with disabilities the same? Or perhaps even an elderly couple?"

Nathan: "No."

Trevour: "Then I see a contradiction in your insights-"

Nathan: "You treat them differently, not because of what they are.. You treat them differently because you have respect."

Trevour: "I don't quite follow, sir. Sounds like a cheap way to ignore the hole in your moral."

Nathan: "I see them as equals, no matter how mentally or physical impaired they are. It's just me treating them differently due to respect. I don't treat them differently because I see them any less."

Trevour: "Then you could say the same about women."

Nathan: "But there is nothing wrong with women."

Trevour: "And there's nothing wrong with disabled or elderly people?"

Nathan: *He sighed, slowly closing his eyes.* (You don't seem to understand what I mean..)

Trevour: "Nathan?"

Nathan: "..." *He started to breathe heavily, as he slowly fell into slumber.*

Trevour: "Sir?"

Nathan: "Zzzz."

Trevour: "Good night, sir." *He closed his eyes and smiled.* (Thank you for giving me a perspective sight of your life..)

----------

*Luna and the champion walked into their room, gently closing the door behind them.*

Champion: "Here we go-" *She hobbled towards the closest bed and leant over it, guiding Luna onto it.*

Luna: *She felt the sheets on both sides, looking down in an awkward-like manner.* "Thanks, aye."

Champion: "May I please ask you a question?" *She smiled and hobbled towards the other vacant bed, keeping an eye on Luna.*

Luna: "Shoot."

Champion: "Your choice of speech. Is that the same way everyone speaks from your home world?"

Luna: "Aha, nah."

Champion: "Then why do you speak like that?"

Luna: "Where we grew up.. There was a lot of slang."

Champion: "Oh my, slang?"

Luna: "I don't know how to explain it."

Champion: "You don't really have a reason?"

Luna: "We talk like this 'cause we no longer cared."

Champion: "Your appearance."

Luna: "I can't really tell what you guys wear, but these clothes are normal."

Champion: "It's all black. Were you part of something?"

Luna: "Ahh..?" *She grunted in recollection, triggering flashbacks of cutting herself with Kylie and Kerry-Anne.* "Somethin'."

Champion: "Why did you come here? Are you here to invade somebody?"

Luna: "Huh? No. I didn't ask to come here." *She yawned, catching the champion's attention.*

Champion: (When she realised she wasn't from this world, she started to have panic attacks.. I've never seen someone naturally fear the beauty of Rostical in my entire life..)

Luna: "Is that all the questions?"

Champion: "Oh my, yes."

Luna: "..." *She stared at the ceiling in thought.*

Champion: *She looked uncomfortable, glancing at her enormous hunchback.* (It hurts a little more than usual today-)

Luna: "Well, what does it feel like to use Rostickal?"

Champion: "It's..." *She sighed, lowering her head.*

Luna: "Aye? Wat's with the sigh?"

Champion: "I don't appreciate Rostical because I excel in it. I appreciate the wonders it can do."

Luna: "That doesn't seem to warrant that sigh?" *She spoke with a question, implying the champion to answer it.*

Champion: "You're good at reading people's vocals."

Luna: *She smirked in recollection.* "Like I said before, I grew up in a shit place.. You had to act tough, learn how to read people's thoughts and body language.. My bro had to do the exact same thing."

Champion: "Why?"

Luna: *She shrugged her shoulders and shook her head.* "I'm still pretty young, but each new generation gets worse and worse.."

Champion: "How old are you?"

Luna: "Seventeen.. You?"

Champion: "I.. Seem to have forgotten."

Luna: "Pssht.. Wateva-"

Champion: "No, no. I'm serious."

Luna: "How can you forget your age?"

Champion: "With Astragons.."

Luna: "Astragongs.. That's the Rostickal shit involvin' space, right?"

Champion: "Yes.. Once you've obtained a certain level of mastery, you're able to use Astragons to slow down the aging process."

Luna: "By slowin' it down, you mean immortality?"

Champion: "Not fully, but essentially."

Luna: "Whoa.." *She gasped and rubbed her cheeks.* "Could I use these Astragongs to help fix my eyes?"

Champion: "No..."

Luna: "Wat? You can almost become immortal, but you can't fix eyes?"

Champion: "It's possible to restore your eyes if they were healed with Radiatons almost immediately."

Luna: "Oh.."

Champion: *She glanced at Luna's eyes, observing the area around them.* (Once she gets to Silver Wind Island, she needs to clean out her wounds.. Those burns seems to have festered with bacteria-)

Luna: "Ahh-" *She suddenly hissed in pain, rubbing her cheeks.*

Champion: "What's the matter?"

Luna: "N-Nothin'-"

Champion: "Oh?"

Luna: "It's just.. I've been getting a lot of pain in my cheeks and forehead lately.."

Champion: (Just as I started to worry.. It seems bacteria has already started to spread..)

Luna: "I'm too tired, but I can't fall asleep with this much pain."

Champion: "If only I knew Radiaton filled healing Rostical..."

Luna: "Aye? Radiaytons?"

Champion: *She shook her head as if it didn't matter.* "Just learn the basics. Neurons and Astragons. You don't need to worry about Radiatons."

Luna: "Why?"

Champion: "Unlike Neurons and Astragons, Radiatons are only passed down through the divine blood or love."

Luna: "Yea?"

Champion: ".. It's not something you have to worry about."

Luna: "Umm, OK?" *She paused.* "So, could I find someone with Radiayton Rostickal to heal my eyes?"

Champion: "The restoration of the eyes, heart and brain once the body has started to naturally heal the wounds is almost impossible-"

Luna: "OK, you can stop there, aye."

Champion: "Okay." *She spoke in respect and pulled on a piece of fabric around her waist, causing her entire upper robes to slide off.* "Ahh, that's better."

Luna: *She listened to the falling fabric, causing her to tilt her head.* "Do you sleep naked or somethin'?"

Champion: "No, just making myself a little more comfortable."

Luna: "Umm, I don't swing like that-"

Champion: *She giggled and walked towards Luna.* "Nor do I."

Luna: "So-"

Champion: "We need our rest." *She stood in front of Luna and stepped to the side.*

Luna: "But I can't-"

Champion: "I know a Rostical which can temporarily disable the senses. It will last long enough for you to fall asleep?"

Luna: "Awesome. Do it." *She spoke with a smile as if she was excited.*

Champion: *She nodded her head and raised her arm.* "Way of bonds disrupt, temper its own dividends, almighty Radiatons disable the foe's awareness-"

Luna: "Foe's awareness? Huh-?"

Champion: "SILENCING FORCE" *She waved her arm across Luna, opening and closing her hand.*

Luna: "You-?" *She motioned her mouth as if she was speaking, causing her to touch her throat.* (My voice-?)

Champion: "I know you can't hear me, but you should be able to have a good night's rest."

Luna: (I-...) *She mumbled and slowly fell into slumber, causing the champion to smile.*

Champion: *She hobbled over to her bed and gently crawled under the sheets, closing her eyes.* (What a fascinating party to travel with.. Tomorrow will be a long day.)

----------

*Lezard, Twortz and Rachael walked down a thin cavern-like path, lit up by glowing crystals on the walls.*

Twortz: "We have been walking for a considerable amount of time-"

Lezard: "Ooo." *He giggled to himself and hobbled up ahead, noticing a glyphic platform.*

Rachael: *She walked with Twortz, staring at Lezard's back.* "What did you find?"

Lezard: "The little glowy path thing Lucky showed us-" *He stared at the glowing line on the ground.* "Has led us to another teleportation glyph."

Twortz: "A way out?"

Lezard: "Indeedly do." *He stepped on the platform and shook his bottom, waiting for the girls to step on.*

Twortz: *She stepped onto the platform and looked down, staring at the glyphic markings in confusion.* "Last time I vividly remember it glowing. Now it is doing nothing."

Rachael: *She stepped on the platform, tapping her foot on it in a curious-like manner.* "Twortz is right."

Twortz: "Hmm." *She nodded her head in a professional-like manner.*

Lezard: "That's probably because Lucky poured some of his Neurons into the glyph."

Rachael: "Go on then." *She spoke with a smile as if she was happy to leave."

Lezard: "Oh, I've got bad news."

Twortz: *She sighed.* "What?"

Lezard: "You see, it takes a lot of my own Neurons to use my healing Remenistal."

Twortz: "What exactly is it you're saying?" *She spoke in a professional, stern-like manner.*

Rachael: "You don't have enough Neurons to activate the glyph?"

Lezard: "Bingo!"

Twortz: "Then-?!" *She frowned and faced Lezard, losing her professional composure.* "How are we getting out of here!?"

Lezard: "Back into your cage!" *He squealed in fright and formed a cross with his fingers, stepping back.* "You both have Neurons! You could easily do it!"

Twortz: "In my cage?"

Rachael: "How could we do that? I don't think we possess enough of these Neurons."

Lezard: "Wrong, my child. You can use Rostical and our heavy friend can use Azure Bursts. Neurons is a vital requirement to use both."

Twortz: (I have these Neurons too?)

Rachael: "Great. How can we use them?"

Lezard: "Well, lucky for us. This glyph has already been prepared. We just need to add Neurons into it to activate it."

Rachael: "What does that mean, already been prepared?"

Lezard: "Such willingness to learn, you inspire me-"

Twortz: "That is not a correct answer to her question."

Lezard: *He sighed.* "In order to create a glyph, you must draw its symbols with Astragons and power it up with Neurons. Since this glyph has already been made, the hard part of making a glyph is done."

Rachael: (That makes sense. If I were to draw a picture and asked someone to colour it in, that would be easier than having someone draw and colour the picture.)

Twortz: "This cave is cold. Tell me how to activate it now."

Rachael: "Twortz.. We're not at work, you don't need to keep talking so sternly."

Twortz: "..." *She paused, avoiding eye contact with Rachael in a snobby-like manner.* (You are not the real Rachael... I should not have to listen to you-)

Lezard: "Merely use your Neurons?"

Twortz: *She frowned with a twitching eye.* "What can't you understand about this scenario? We don't know how to use our Neurons."

Lezard: "Okay, okay. Just simply use either your Remenistal or Azure Burst."

Rachael: "Is that it?"

Lezard: "Yuppers."

Twortz: (Tedious-) *She quickly swayed the frying pan and blew a strong, loud gust, causing the glyph underneath the party to suddenly glow purple.*

Lezard: "Ooo, almost!"

Rachael: "Rock Pillar." *She punched her fists and swayed her arm across, blasting a small boulder into the air.*

Lezard: *He watched the glyph shine, queuing him to squeal in accomplishment.* "You did it, children!"

Rachael: "We did-?"

*The glyph pulsed and suddenly flashed, blinding the party with purple light.*

Twortz: "Tsst-" *She stepped forward with squinted eyes and noticed she stood on sand.*

Rachael: "The waves are much louder-" *She blinked several times, noticing she stood on the beach.*

Lezard: "Wow, wasn't that exciting?"

Twortz: "It's night-?"

Rachael: "Kah!-" *She suddenly looked ill, collapsing to her knees.*

Twortz: "..." *She watched Rachael gasp for air which triggered images of her dying by PKMY's hand.*

Lezard: "What's wrong, little one?"

Rachael: "I just feel sick."

Lezard: "You were sick when you first entered the catacombs too."

Twortz: "I don't recall the true Rachael getting motion sickness."

Rachael: (True?)

Lezard: "Maybe you're just not good with teleportation glyphs? I remember a few friends back in my days had trouble stomaching food when teleported. They had to even skip dinner-"

Twortz: *She shivered, causing her to glance down the empty shore.* "Are we going to find a place to rest?"

Lezard: *He leant down and helped Rachael onto her feet, supporting her on his shoulder.* "It's getting spine tingling chilly out here."

Rachael: *She started to sweat.* "Yeah."

Lezard: *He noticed the calm water, causing him to smirk with an idea.* "Right here."

Twortz: "Right here? Don't be absurd!"

Lezard: "Why not?"

Twortz: "We are not animals!"

Lezard: "Well, technically we are-"

Twortz: "I am not sleeping on a beach!"

Rachael: "I don't-, tired-" *She sighed and suddenly fell unconscious, causing Lezard to awkwardly and slowly lower himself onto the sand.*

Lezard: *He placed Rachael on her side and adjusted her arms and legs, ensuring she was lying comfortably.* "Looks like Razzypoo shares my mind frame-"

Twortz: "She passed out. She doesn't share your mind frame."

Lezard: "If you're always serious, you'll never get to enjoy life."

Twortz: "And if you're always slack and lazy, you'll never get anywhere in life."

Lezard: "Interesting." *He lay on the sand next to Rachael and pressed his back against hers, closing his eyes.*

Twortz: "I don't believe-" *She quickly turned around and started to rub her temples.* "Are you for serious?"

Lezard: "Most definitely-"

Twortz: "Be quiet."

Lezard: "..." *He silently smiled, knowing he annoyed Twortz.*

Twortz: "You just said it's spine chilling cold!"

Lezard: "Actually, I said spine tingling-"

Twortz: "Tsskt!" *She hissed in growing anger and started to walk away, causing her to notice the lively sounds of the nocturnal creatures.*

Lezard: "See you in the morning." *He smiled as if he knew she wouldn't leave by herself.*

Twortz: *She sat on the sand and sighed in defeat, placing the frying pan on the ground.* (I can't-)

*Twortz's stomach rumbled, causing her to frown with sadness.*

Twortz: (I can't fall asleep on an empty stomach..)

----------

*Tara suddenly appeared outside of Sorrowprax's walls, glaring at the hills in the distance.*

Tara: (I was a little late to prepare, but, those prisoners will pay for breaking out-)

*Tara smirked and started to run forward at incredible speeds, swaying her arms behind her.*

Tara: "Fufufu." (I'll try not to kill them when I confront them..)

*Tara thought to herself with a widening smirk and leant forward, suddenly flashstepping out of the area.*

Chapter 5: Travelling Endeavours

*Sunlight shined on the shore, slowly waking Lezard up.*

Lezard: "And the sun's warmth effectively woke Lezard and his allies up-" *He mumbled with his eyes shut and stretched.*

*Lezard leant up and rubbed his eyes, noticing Rachael staring out into the ocean.*

Lezard: "Razzypoo?"

Rachael: "Ashton and I used to watch the sunrise together. Either before our morning shift or after our rare overnight shifts."

Lezard: "Ashton?"

Rachael: *She snapped out of her train of thought and discreetly wiped a tear before facing Lezard.* "I'm ready to see your father soon."

Lezard: "Ooo, ready to leave I take it?" *He grumbled to himself and stood up, brushing sand off his clothes.*

Rachael: "Hehe, sure am." *She smiled and formed a fist, enthusiastically nodding her head.*

Lezard: "What about the-?" *He slowly looked to his side, noticing Twortz snoring on all fours with her bottom facing the air.*

Rachael: "Hehe, Twortz."

Lezard: "It looks like she's trying to devour the sand?"

Rachael: "Lezard, try to be more courteous regarding her weight please."

Lezard: "Hmmm... Twortz?" *He spoke with a smile, causing her to snort into consciousness.*

Twortz: "Waffles?"

Lezard: "Bwarharh, she won't make it easy for me."

Twortz: "Where?"

Rachael: "We're ready to leave."

Twortz: "Tsst.." *She picked up the frying pan and slowly stood up, wiping away a trail of sand which was stuck to one side of her mouth.*

Lezard: "Yum yums.." *He unintentionally pulled an awkward, disgusted look before facing down the shore.*

Twortz: *She sniffed and cracked her back, listening to her stomach grumble.* "I'm really hungry."

Rachael: *She placed her hand on her stomach.* (I'm not? Cool.)

Lezard: "I'm a little hungry too, bwarharh! My father should have some delightful treats for us whenever we see him."

Twortz: "Well, there's my incentive!" *She waddled closer to Rachael and Lezard, implying she was ready to leave.*

Rachael: "Hehe, sounds good!"

Lezard: "Yay! And we're off on another amazing adventure!"

----------

*Luna, Trevour, Nathan and the champion stood outside the village, all stretching in different poses.*

Luna: "Gah.." *She moaned with a sigh.*

Trevour: "What is it, madam?"

Luna: "It's so freakin' early."

Nathan: "Suck it up."

Luna: "Oh, yea-?"

Champion: "An argument no matter how small, is not a good substitute for breakfast, this could ruin the start to our day."

Nathan: "Hmph." *He chuckled in agreement.*

Luna: "Wateva." *She rubbed sleep out of her eyes.*

Trevour: "Well-" *He adjusted the armour on his arms, glancing at the party.* "Are we all ready for a long walk ahead of us?"

Nathan: "Sure am." *He tightened the strap to the sword behind his back and grunted with a smirk, placing his hands on his head.*

Trevour: *He gently held Luna around the elbow, readying himself to leave.* "Our destination is North West, but I think we should head directly West then North."

Champion: "Oh my, wouldn't that make our walk even longer?"

Luna: "Longer? I disapprove."

Trevour: "We would bypass all the terrain and we will be able to drop you off along the way."

Champion: *She smiled in appreciation.* (How considerate-)

Nathan: "Let's go." *He grunted in a deep voice and started to walk forward, causing the party to follow.*

Luna: "So... Wat kind of elements can you guys use?"

Trevour: "Madam?"

Nathan: "You're asking questions? Your attitude today has changed from yesterday."

Luna: "Ya know, if we had to walk together for a few weeks, it'd be really awkward if we didn't talk at all.."

Trevour: "For a few weeks?"

Luna: "It's a joke, Rusty." *She sighed at Trevour as if it would've been obvious.*

Trevour: "My apologies, madam. Heh heh."

Luna: *She glanced to each side in a blind-like manner.* "So back to my question, shit nuggets."

Champion: (Shit nuggets?) *She thought to herself in shock and glanced around her feet, ensuring she didn't step on anything foul.*

Trevour: "Well, as you know, my affinity is ground."

Nathan: "I don't have one." *He spoke as if he didn't care with his deep voice.*

Luna: "Aye?" *She sounded surprised.*

Champion: "Elemental affinities are Rostical Users."

Luna: "Wat 'bout them Azure thingos?"

Nathan: "People can use elemental based Azure Bursts, but that doesn't relate to an affinity."

Luna: "Kool, and wat about you, champ?"

Champion: "I'm one of the lucky few blessed with different elemental affinities."

Nathan: (I don't want to sound arrogant, but I really don't want to talk about Rostical for this entire trip.)

Trevour: "How many affinities do you know?"

Champion: "Umm.."

Luna: "C'mon, if I could use Rostickal, I'd know every single one with even thinkin' about them!"

Trevour: "I concur, madam."

Champion: "I know over five."

Trevour and Nathan: "What?!"

Luna: "Whoa, what's with the crazy response?!"

Trevour: "I've met a captain who possessed three different affinities. And this allowed her to be feared."

Nathan: (The name.. The amount of affinities which is so rare..) "I think I know where you're from."

Champion: "Oh my?" *She spoke with lowering morale.* (Is he someone from my past?! But I don't sense anything from him!-)

Nathan: "You're the Battling Oxident's champion, aren't you?"

Champion: *She sighed in relief, slowly nodding her head.* "Oh my.. You caught me."

Trevour: "W-Wow, what an honour! Heh heh."

Champion: "I thought I recognised you too."

Nathan: *He smirked, forming a fist.* "I'll beat you one day."

Luna: "Wait, what is Battlin' Oxident?"

Trevour: (Wow, it feels strange having to teach someone really common knowledge-) "Battling Oxident is the world's most known sport-"

Nathan: "I wouldn't call it a sport."

Champion: "Oh my, I agree." *She nodded her head with an agreeing frown.*

Trevour: "Well-"

Nathan: "I'd say it's more of a competition than a sport."

Champion: "Yes."

Luna: "I don't care if it's the name of a toilet. Someone start tellin' me some shit... Pun intended."

Trevour: "Heh heh. It's held in a special arena inside a Spacial Funnel in Surpreon."

Luna: "Surpreon? Spacial Funnel? Wow, seriously? You're gonna answer me by raisin' more questions..?"

Trevour: "Ah...?" *He glanced at Nathan and the champion as if he didn't know how to explain it.*

Nathan: "Battling Oxident consists of a one on one matchup, inside a massive dirt arena."

Champion: "People from different nations come together and participate or watch the battles."

Luna: "Awesome." *She spoke with a smile as if she was interested.*

Nathan: (Ha, not many women I've spoken to enjoy talking about Battling Oxident.) *He smiled in thought.*

Luna: "Tell me more, aye."

Nathan: "Well, the champion here, is what her name states. She's the champion."

Trevour: "I've only been to two Battling Oxidents in my life. I would have never of thought that I'd be occupied with the Battling Oxident's champion."

Luna: "Wat makes you the champion?"

Trevour: "Maybe having five plus affinities, heh heh."

Champion: "No-"

Nathan: "It's not her already devastating power in Rostical, or the Rostical roster she possesses."

Luna: "Then wat?"

Trevour: "Sir?"

Nathan: "It's the level of combinations she's able to use.. I've only ever seen someone of her talent, effectively pull off seven different Rosticals which all form into one combo."

Trevour: "A combo?" *He had a flashback of the champion freezing his mud-like sand on the Scoldrant.* "I see."

Luna: "So, we should be fine, right?"

Nathan: "Yes." *He spoke on his breath, walking down a rocky path across open land.*

Trevour: "Wait a second, madam. If you're the champion, that Scoldrant from before would've been nothing to you."

Nathan: (Now that he mentions it, he's right.)

Champion: "I didn't want to draw any attention, so I purposely limited myself to using two affinities during our previous fight."

Nathan: "That seems kinda stupid. You're the champion, anyone who's battled or been there knows who you are."

Champion: "You didn't."

Nathan: "Ah, well, okay then."

Luna: "But why hide your identity? Isn't that somethin' to boast about?"

Champion: "No-"

Trevour: "You certainly weren't being discreet when you wanted us to call you champion."

Champion: "I just, have my reasons." *She spoke with closure, as if she didn't want to talk about it.*

Trevour: "If she has her reasons, we must be respectful of that."

Luna: (Well.. It makes me wonder who she was running from then?)

Nathan: *He glanced at Trevour, focusing his attention back in front.* "Yeah."

Champion: "Oh my, thank you."

Luna: "So Battlin' Oxident is inside a spacial tunnel at surpies?"

Trevour: "Spacial Funnels are Astragon packed portals."

Luna: "Aye? Wat has Astragongs got to do with anythin'?"

Trevour: "Surpreon is a large city, but in retrospect, Battling Oxident exceeds Surpreon's entire city."

Luna: "So, Surpreon is a city, got it." *She grunted to herself and continued to walk forward, oblivious to the forest to her right or the beautiful wide area around her.*

Trevour: "Yes. My bad, madam."

Champion: "Spacial Funnels are like pockets of space. This particular Spacial Funnel contains Battling Oxident."

Luna: (Magic... Wormholes.. My nerdy assed brother would fangasm over this shit-)

Nathan: "I think that about covers the basics?"

Trevour: "Oh, Battling Oxident is held on average, every six months."

Luna: "Oh?"

Trevour: "Like Silver Wind Island, Battling Oxident would also be a good place to find information."

Nathan: "Yeah. I've met a lot of strange people there." *He grunted in a deep voice, continuing to walk with his hands on his head.*

Champion: "Yes." *She observed the area around her, noticing small thin grass.*

Trevour: *He noticed a large lighthouse-like structure in the distance, causing him to gasp in amazement.* "Wowza, look at that everyone!"

Champion: "That would be...?"

Trevour: "The Elemental Tower, you see?"

Luna: "It looks awesome!"

Trevour: "I know-" *He paused in mid-sentence, causing Nathan and the champion to chuckle.*

Luna: "Aha, tell me more about this tower."

Nathan: "I actually don't know much about it." *He raised an eyebrow, as if he couldn't remember.*

Champion: "Nor do I.. Despite my title, you need all sorts of passes to even be able to enter the tower."

Luna: "That's shit."

Nathan: "What about you, you got some exclusive pass to enter?" *He glanced at Trevour, watching the sunlight shimmer off his armour.*

Trevour: "Negative, sir."

Nathan: "Oh?"

Trevour: "The guards that monitor The Elemental Tower are Grey's men from Silver Wind Island."

Luna: "Aye? I don't think I'll remember all this stuff! Who or what's grey, and Silver Wind Island is the place we're heading to, right?"

Trevour: "Grey is the ruler of Silver Wind Island, and yes we are."

Luna: "Yea-" *She rocked her head in an impressed-like manner, as if she was happy she got it right.* "Guess it's startin' to sink in."

Trevour: "Heh heh."

Luna: "Why do you rattle like a tin, Trevor?"

Trevour: "It's Trev-our."

Luna: "Aha, wat a weird assed name."

Trevour: "A-Ah..?"

Champion: (She very hot headed, but at the same time, she can listen when she wants to.)

Trevour: "It's because I'm a warrior."

Luna: "Warrior?"

Champion: "You know, the warriors and the Consultants?"

Luna: "Not really..."

Nathan: "You were in Sorrowprax, seriously?!"

Luna: "I thought this was a whole joke.. A dream, I dunno... So I didn't pay any attention, aye."

Nathan: Hmm.." *His annoyed-like manner instantly faded away.* "Well, the warriors..?"

Luna: "Nope."

Nathan: "Captains?"

Luna: "Nope-" *She suddenly recalled a flashback of Mindy, Cindy and Wendy.* "Y-Yes..."

Nathan: "Well, they're warriors."

Luna: *She rudely pulled her elbow out of Trevour's grip, causing her to blindly face him in anger.* "What the flying fuck is wrong with you?!"

Trevour: "M-Madam?" *He leant back startled.*

Luna: "It was an accident! Kerry-Anne wouldn't have-" *She frowned, causing Nathan and the champion to look at Trevour in confusion.*

Trevour: *He shook his head, as if he didn't know what she was talking about.* "I-I don't know what you're-"

Luna: "M-My eyes! It's not like I hated my life as it was!"

Nathan: (Hated her life-?)

Luna: "The fuck!"

Champion: (The poor thing is still adjusting to what has recently happened to her-)

Trevour: "I-I'm not like that-"

Luna: "Lies-"

Nathan: "Relax, he really isn't."

Champion: "If he wanted to, he could've got reinforcements while we slept at the Inn."

Luna: "Yea.. But.." *She took a deep breath and tried to calm herself down.*

Trevour: "Luna?"

Luna: "Just.. Fuck off." *She spoke with a softening voice.*

Trevour: ".. Luna?"

Luna: *She sighed, looking down to her feet.* "Umm, yea, my bad.." *She sounded embarrassed.*

Champion: *She smiled with her eyes closed.* "Let's get a move on."

Nathan: "Sounds good to me. We can't afford to waste any more time."

Trevour: "Madam?" *He hobbled up to Luna and gently touched her elbow, implying for her to comply.*

Luna: (Th-They didn't care-?)

Champion: "What else would you like to know?" *She smiled and started to hobble down the path, causing Nathan to follow.*

Trevour: "I guess you wouldn't know much about the warriors then." *He spoke with a widening smile, implying he knew lots about them.*

Champion: "I'd be fascinated to know more myself. It's not often you get to hear about the warriors from an insider."

Luna: "Yea." *She smirked and allowed Trevour to guide her.*

Nathan: (The more I know about the enemy, the better.)

Trevour: "Well, have I mentioned the rankings yet?"

Luna and Nathan: "No?"

Champion: "I know there're vice-captains and captains, but that's about it."

Trevour: "Okay, it gets a little temperamental." *He coughed to clear his throat, readying himself for a speech.*

----------

Lezard: "Lezard and the girls walked down the nice warm shore, continuing to admire the scenery around them."

Twortz: *She frowned with gritted teeth.* (Does this man want to ever act his age-?)

*Whale-like cries echoed in the distance, instantly catching the party's attention.*

Rachael: "What is-?"

Lezard: "If you're hungry, you can just tell us. There's no need to moan-" *He spoke with a carefree smile, glancing at Twortz.*

Twortz: "Excuse me-?!"

*Whales suddenly swam to the surface and splashed in the passing waves, causing glittering ripples of water to swirl around them.*

Rachael: *She gasped, staring out into the ocean in amazement.* "W-What's with the water?"

Lezard: "It's the Astragons-"

Whales: "HYDRO CANNON" *They moaned at the same time and blew out an eruption of high pressured water into the air, leaving behind a glittering spray.*

Rachael: "Another Scoldrant that can talk." *She spoke on her breath, as she continued to stare at the whale-like Scoldrants in amazement.*

Twortz: "..." *She watched the whales dive back into the water, leaving violent ripples on the surface.*

Lezard: "Ooo, splendid-"

Twortz: "Don't we have somewhere to be?"

Lezard: "Oh right."

Twortz: "Lead the way." *She spoke in a stern, professional-like manner, watching Lezard hobble down the shore.*

Rachael: (Twortz..)

Lezard: "Don't worry, everyone! We should be there soon!"

----------

*Tara suddenly appeared in front of Nikitik Village, causing a faint buzz-like sound to echo.*

Tara: "Their energy signature was last located here-" *She whispered to herself and entered the village, glancing to each side.* "You!"

*Tara screamed and pointed at a nearby villager managing a small carriage filled with bread.*

Villager: "Y-Yes?"

Tara: "Despite the no armour, I'm a warrior, okay?"

Villager: "O-Oh?" *He quickly dropped to his knees, lowering his head.*

Tara: "There has been an unscheduled warrior sighting in this village. Tell me all you know now."

Villager: "You mean the warrior that was here yesterday-?"

Tara: "Where?!"

Villager: "H-He was with other people."

Tara: "Did they wear strange garments?"

Villager: "Two of them did."

Tara: "Where are they?"

Villager: "They went into the Inn." *He pointed to his side while keeping his head lowered.*

Tara: "The Inn?" *She stepped to the side and faced the Inn, smirking at the water fountain.* "Fufufu."

----------

Nathan: (We've covered a lot of ground right now-) *He mumbled to himself in thought, staring at an enormous tight forest in the distance.*

Luna: "So, even vice-captains could slaughter an entire village?"

Trevour: "I'm afraid so, madam."

Champion: "You captains are very frightening."

Trevour: "They are."

Luna: "Wat captains are there?"

Champion: "I've seen a few, all were very intimidating." *She hobbled to each side, walking towards the forest.*

Luna: "If non captain rankin' warriors can't use Rostickal, how can you?"

Trevour: "To be honest, there's probably a fair few that can. It's just illegal."

Nathan: "Why? Holding someone back-" *He glanced at Trevour.* "Even if it's a warrior and Rostical, you warriors could be feared even more."

Trevour: "It's to shine all the spotlight on to the captains."

Luna: "So there could be strong non-captains?"

Trevour: "Negative, madam."

Champion: "Oh my, care to explain?"

Trevour: "If or when someone makes captain ranking, they undergo vigorous training."

Nathan: "What's makes this training worthwhile?"

Trevour: "I don't know.. I'm not a captain."

Champion: (Ah.. So, even if someone had the potential to be captain, this training sets them apart from other warriors?)

Nathan: *A heartbeat-like pulse thumped through his body, causing him to stare at the forest in curiosity.* "This, is The Twilight Forest?"

Trevour: *He looked up, noticing the tall trees.* "Yes it is, sir."

Nathan: (What a weird feeling.)

Champion: "Oh my, we're here already?"

Trevour: "You almost sound disappointed, heh heh."

Luna: "Aha, gonna miss us?"

Nathan: "Hmmph."

Champion: "Unfortunately, for my best interest, I need to leave."

Trevour: *He took a deep breath and let go of Luna's elbow, allowing him to bend over in exhaustion.* "Could I please take a break?"

Nathan: "... We're far away from Sorrowprax now. I'm in no rush right now."

Trevour: "What about the yellow-eyed condition?"

Nathan: "I've never had a proper lead to go by." *He shrugged his shoulders and sighed, as if the idea bothered him.*

Trevour: (Nathan, despite the quality of his values, has no true purpose as of yet-)

Champion: "If you have no leads, maybe spending a little time in Silver Wind Island would be of benefit?"

Nathan: "Maybe.." *He walked towards the closest tree and rested his back against it, placing his hands on his head.*

Luna: *She wiped sweat off her face and pinched her black clothes, waving them back and forth.* (I'm not really hot, but I'm sweating like a pig.)

Nathan: "If we've reached The Twilight Forest, then-"

Trevour: "It won't be long until we reach the city."

Luna: "We've spent hours talkin' about warriors.."

Trevour: "Yes."

Luna: "Wat is your ranking?"

Champion: "..."

Trevour: "It's thirty-three."

Luna: "Oh.. Nowhere near, aye."

Trevour: "Heh heh."

Nathan: "Haha-"

Luna: "Wow, I'm on a roll. Gettin' Nathan to laugh too."

Nathan: "Tssk." *He pouted and looked away.*

Champion: "We shouldn't be out for too long."

Luna: "Aye?"

Trevour: *He nodded his head.* "We'll be walking between two forests, both are quite dangerous."

Nathan: (I don't really remember, but I have a feeling I should be more worried about The Twilight Forest-)

?????: "Yeup." *A cat-like cry caught the party's attention.*

----------

Tara: *She stepped out of the Inn and smirked, staring at the water fountain.* (Left a few hours ago? I'll see them in a few minutes, fufufufufu.)

*Tara stepped forward and flashstepped, causing a pulse of dirt to blow where she stood.*

----------

Trevour: "Oh? What is that?" *He turned around and looked down, noticing a small purple furry Scoldrant.*

Nathan: *He stared at the Scoldrant, causing him to hold onto his sword.* "That's a scout Scoldrant."

Champion: "A scout? That little thing?"

Trevour: "I'm not the type to judge a book by its cover, but look at him." *He smiled at the Scoldrant.*

Nathan: "They usually alert other much bigger Scoldrants of prey."

Trevour: "W-Why is that?"

Nathan: "So the larger Scoldrants keep them around for protection."

Champion: "Oh my. If this is true, perhaps we should do the unthinkable?"

?????: "Yeup?" *It hopped towards the party, keeping an eye on Luna.*

Luna: "That sounds familiar?"

Nathan: "Don't be fooled, it can levitate."

Trevour: "Got it, sir!"

Luna: "Levitate, like float?"

Nathan: "Yeah."

?????: "Yeup.."

Luna: (Those meow-like sounds-) "Kitty?"

?????: "Yeup!"

Nathan: (It responded-?)

Luna: "It can't be-" *She whispered, triggering a flashback.*

----------

?????: "Yeup?" *It started to rub itself against Luna's leg in a cat-like manner and started to purr.*

Luna: "W-What?" *She looked down and watched the purple hairball continue to rub against her leg in an affectionate-like manner.*

?????: "Yeu."

Luna: (Hey, you ain't so bad-)

*A scream echoed in the distance, causing Luna to quickly look over her shoulder.*

----------

Luna: "L-Leave her!" *She ran blindly towards the sounds of the hairball.*

?????: *It watched Luna stop in front of it.* "Yeu?"

Luna: *She suddenly faced the party's direction, spreading her arms in a protective-like manner.* "I mean it!"

Trevour: "Her?"

Nathan: "What are you-?"

Champion: "Oh my-"

Luna: "She's not a threat!-"

?????: "Yeup.." *She hopped directly behind Luna's legs and hesitantly glanced at the party.*

Champion: "It seems to have formed an attachment to Luna."

Luna: "Aha.." *She slowly bent down and patted the air, trying to find the Scoldrant.*

?????: "Yeup..." *She hopped into Luna's reach and started to purr.*

Trevour: "What are your thoughts, Nathan?"

Nathan: *He listened to the Scoldrant's purr, looking at Luna's smirk.* "Well, if she isn't causing a hassle-"

Champion: "What about the larger Scoldrants?"

Nathan: "They would have attacked by now." *He lowered his arm, as if the Scoldrant was no longer a threat.*

Luna: "Aha.." *She giggled, feeling the Scoldrant's soft fur.*

Trevour: *He stood in a casual-like manner, glancing at Nathan and the champion.* "Although a little temperamental, if the Scoldrant isn't a threat, shall we continue, everyone?"

Luna: "Like I said, I just know she ain't no threat."

Champion: (What a very strange way of talking-)

?????: "The rodent may not be a threat, but I am, fufufufu."

*A woman suddenly appeared behind Luna and violently grabbed the Scoldrant by the fur, lifting it up to her face.*

Champion: "O-Oh my, who are you!?" *She faced a woman, noticing her tight red and black leather clothing.*

Woman: *She listened to the Scoldrant hiss in fear.* "Shut up, rodent!"

?????: "Y-Yeup.." *She stopped her squirm, as if she could feel the woman's evil intentions.*

Trevour: "H-How temperamental.. It's Tara."

Tara: "Neh?" *She glared at Trevour, suddenly frowning in anger.* "You fat chunky heretic!"

Trevour: "I, ah-?"

Tara: "If it wasn't for your betrayal, these prisoners wouldn't be here today-"

Luna: "Let go of her!"

?????: "Yeup!-"

Tara: "No-"

Luna: *She frowned and stood up, facing Tara's general direction.* "Let her go!-" *She took several steps forward, trying to grab the Scoldrant off Tara.*

Tara: "Fufufu." *She placed her palm on Luna's forehead, keeping her out of striking distance.*

Trevour: "M-Madam, you mustn't-"

?????: *She watched Luna struggle, as she risked herself trying to free her.* (Yeup...)

Tara: "Hah!" *She let go of the Scoldrant and suddenly kicked her in mid-air, violently knocking her into a tree.*

?????: "Yeu!-" *She hissed in pain and squinted her eyes, slowly sliding down the tree.*

Luna: "No! You hurt-"

Tara: *She grabbed Luna's throat and pulled her in, placing her other hand around the side of Luna's head.* "I'll be snapping your-"

Nathan: *He suddenly slid on the ground next to Tara and intensely stared at her, unsheathing his sword.* "Double Slash."

Tara: *She quickly threw Luna on the ground and swayed to each side, listening to the sword slice past her.* "Fast-"

*Tara's foot suddenly sunk into quicksand, causing her to look down in shock.*

Trevour: *He stared at Tara with his hands tightly placed together.* "SWIRLING SANDPIT"

Champion: "ICICLE EDGE"

Tara: (Another Rostical User-?!) *She looked up, watching ice spears plummet towards her.*

Nathan: "Gotcha-"

Tara: "Don't underestimate a single digit warrior-" *Her image suddenly disappeared, causing the ice spears to stab into the sand where she stood.*

Trevour: "She flashstepped out of my-"

Tara: *She flashstepped behind Trevour and straightened her leg, sweeping Trevour off his feet.* "Hah!" *She punched Trevour in the throat, knocking him across the dirt.*

Champion: *She listened to Trevour's armour rattle, watching him roll onto his side.* (She punched him before he even touched the ground-)

Tara: *She opened and closed her hand, smirking with confidence.* "We can do this the easy or the hard way."

Nathan: "Tssk.." *He stood in a battle-ready pose, pointing the sword at Tara.*

Luna: *She started to panic, as she crawled along the dirt towards the Scoldrant.* "Are you OK?"

?????: "Yeu-"

Tara: "How pathetic!" *She gently placed her hand on her waist, causing Nathan and the champion to gasp as if they knew what she was going to do.*

Nathan: (She's going to release her weapon!-)

Tara: "Harh!" *She swayed her arm forward, causing a string of sparks to swirl around a long red whip.*

Champion: *She watched the whip slither directly towards Luna.* (She's taking advantage of her blindness-)

Nathan: "Azure Burst, Air Slash." *He sliced the sword to the side, causing a slash-like wave of visible air to hit Tara's whip, deflecting it back.*

Tara: "Nice save, peasant." *She smirked, glancing at Nathan in disgust.*

Trevour: *He slowly leant up, holding his shoulder in pain.* (This is what I get for acting so casual! This was my biggest fear-)

Tara: *She snapped the whip by her side, glancing at each party member.* "It's a little disorientating. I don't know which one to kill first-"

Champion: (I might have no choice but to use my Grand Rostical?)

Trevour: "You're sick in the head."

Nathan and Tara: "Huh?" *They looked at him in shock.*

Trevour: "I joined the warriors to become a better person.."

*Images of young men holding floating rocks in their hands flashed in Trevour's mind, causing him to frown.*

Trevour: "This isn't what I asked for!" *He stood up and clapped his hands shut.*

Tara: "And to think, you somehow managed to get down to thirty-three. Fufufu, you're a joke-"

Nathan: "He may be a joke, but he's a joke worth telling your friends about."

Trevour: "Sir?" *He looked at Nathan in shock.*

Nathan: *He glanced at Trevour with a smirk.* "Come on!" *He shouted and ran directly towards Tara, raising the sword.*

Tara: "Fufufu, you lack skill. Charging at me like this-" *She swayed her whip directly towards Nathan's head.*

Nathan: *He threw the sword into the air.* "Lack skill?" *He suddenly slid along the ground towards Tara.*

Tara: *She looked down and back up, noticing the whip flick the air where Nathan would've ran into.* "Don't get so cocky-"

Nathan: *He slid in between Tara's legs and hopped back up, staring at her back.* "I've spent years training-"

Tara: "What a waste-" *She suddenly spun around and kicked Nathan off his feet, flicking the whip towards his face.*

Nathan: (How-?)

Trevour: "DUST STORM" *He punched the ground, causing a swirl of dirt to erupt up, hitting Tara on the elbow.*

Tara: "Hah-?" *Her arm moved away from the dirt, causing the whip to flick into the ground.*

Nathan: (She missed-) *He hit the ground and rolled back, catching his sword as it fell into his hands.*

Tara: "Damn you, heretic!-"

Champion: "This has gone for too long.." *She stared at Tara with an emotionless face, as the light from a red glyph gave her face scary-like shadowing.*

Tara: (A red glyph? I thought she used ice on me before-)

Champion: *She cupped her hands, causing the glyph to suddenly spiral around her hands instead.* "FLAME BOLT"

*The champion pushed forward and shot out three fireballs directly towards Tara.*

Tara: "Rostical Users outside the warrior rankings are feared, but-" *She swayed her whip across the fireballs, causing them to prematurely explode.*

Nathan: *He covered his face and moved back.* "Watch where you're shooting your Rostical!"

Champion: *She watched the fire swirl into the whip, causing her to look shocked.* "What just happened?"

Tara: *She licked her lips, causing her to smirk.* "Yumm.. Your Neurons taste amazing!"

Champion: (She can somehow absorb Neurons?!)

Tara: "How scary, knowing opposite affinities such as ice and fire... Too bad.. You could've made a fine warrior indeed."

Trevour: "DUST STORM"

Tara: "Give it a rest-" *She spun around and flicked the whip, slapping the erupting dirt away.*

Trevour: *He leant to the side, as if Tara's counter damaged him somehow.* "How did you-?"

Nathan: "Hah!" *He ran into striking distance and swayed to the side, slashing across Tara's face.*

Tara: *She quickly leant back, avoiding the slash.* "Ha!-" *She jumped back forward and kicked Nathan in the stomach.*

Nathan: *He caught Tara's foot and held it, readying to jab the sword through her leg.* "Let's see if you can flashstep with one working leg!-"

Trevour: "SWIRLING SANDPIT" *He punched the ground, causing a swirl of sand to spiral around Tara's only foot on the ground.*

Tara: "Tssk." *She watched her foot sink into the sand.* (Now I can't follow up with a critical-)

Nathan: "Hah!" *He violently rammed the sword towards Tara's foot.*

Tara: *She leant forward and jumped up, supporting all her body in Nathan's grip.* "Fufu!"

Nathan: *He looked up, staring at Tara in shock.* "You-?"

Tara: *She quickly kicked to the side, knocking Nathan's sword away.* "How does it feel to have luck on your side all the time?"

Nathan: "On our side? You're the one that was lucky enough to get out of my attack!-"

Tara: "Luck? That was skill!" *She suddenly slapped Nathan, causing a pulse of wind to blow his hair back.*

Nathan: *He slid back and looked at the sword, noticing it was slightly bent.* (She bent metal with a counter based kick?)

Tara: *She landed on the ground and back flipped over the sandpit created by Trevour, facing Nathan in an annoyed-like manner.* "How do grubs like yourselves manage to live for so long?"

Trevour: (Unfortunately, I can't really do that much... I only know two Rostical!)

Nathan: *His body glowed a shade of blue.* "Stop talking."

Tara: "You aren't the only one that possesses Azure Bursts." *She spoke on her breath, as her body glowed a shade of blue.*

Champion: "ICICLE EDGE" *She raised her arm and swayed it down, blasting four ice spears towards Tara.*

Tara: *She flicked her wrist, causing the whip to straighten like a sword.* "Fufufu."

Trevour: (She's straightened the whip by adding her Astragons into it and manipulating its structure-)

Tara: "Tangrowth Slash." *She jabbed the whip into the ground, causing vein-like whips to erupt into the air.*

Champion: *She watched the ice shatter past Tara's shoulders, as her whips violently shattered them behind her.* (She's skilled-)

Nathan: *He charged towards Tara, lowering the sword to his side.* "Air Slash." *He sliced upwards, slicing a visible air slash towards Tara.*

Tara: *She casually raised the whip out of the ground and blocked the air slash with ease.* "I've just decided I will kill everyone besides the Rostical User.. The Consultants may have use of someone with a unique affinity like yourself."

Champion: "...-"

Trevour: "DUST STORM" *He punched the ground, erupting a swirl of dirt into Tara's back.*

Tara: "Argh?!" *She leant back slightly startled.* "Fufu! It only feels like small needles! You're so weak!"

Champion: (I won't use my Grand Rostical.. The Rasticsplash alone will hurt my party members-, so..)

*A bright red glyph shined underneath the champion, catching Tara's attention.*

Nathan: *He ran into striking distance, slashing the sword across.* "Double Slash."

Tara: *She twirled out of Nathan's strike.* "Tssk-"

Nathan: "Harh!" *He hopped to the side and slashed across Tara's shoulder, causing a small spark to flash off the leather.* (The leather is as hard as armour!-)

Tara: (How did I not avoid that strike-?) *She looked down, noticing one of her feet sink into unnaturally soft sand.*

Trevour: "SWIRLING SANDPIT"

Champion: "Flames consume and burn my Astragons-" *The glyph slowly expanded and connected lines into itself forming a glyphic platform.*

Trevour: (I can feel Tara's power, just by her essence in the sand-)

Champion: "HEAT LANCE" *She pushed forward, blasting two curved fire lances directly towards Tara.*

Tara: "I kill Rostical Users! I will absorb all if its Neurons!"

Nathan: "Double Slash." *He quickly slashed to the side and downwards, causing Tara to stagger in shock.*

Tara: "Dirty lamp-"

Trevour: "DUST STORM" *A swirl of dirt erupted up, hitting Tara on the knee.*

Tara: "Yah?!" *She leant to the side, watching the fire lances brightly light up her face.*

Champion: "Get out of the way, Nathan!"

Tara: *She flicked her whip, readying to absorb the fire.* "What makes you so special? Fufufu, I decided I'll kill you after all-"

Champion: "I'm Battling Oxident's champion!"

Tara: *She spoke in shock.* "What did you-?"

*The fire lances hit the whip, causing a bright massive explosion to blast Tara back off her feet.*

Tara: "Ah-?!" *She spiralled in the air and hit a tree behind her, causing its bark to crack.* "Oof-"

*Tara fell onto her knees and the sounds of snapping wood caused her to look back in shock.*

Trevour: "The tree, Nathan!"

Nathan: *He smirked and faced Tara, slicing the sword across.* "Air Slash."

*Nathan sliced a visible air slash towards Tara, watching it suddenly hit the tree behind her.*

Tara: *She watched bark snap off the tree in a cut-like manner, noticing the tree slowly arching over her.* (He purposely missed me?)

Champion: (Fantastic! The tree will collapse on top of her!)

Luna: *She held the Scoldrant in her lap, closely wrapping her arms around her in a protective-like manner.* (It's OK, it's OK-)

?????: "Yeup-"

Tara: "Grrr-" *She flicked the whip behind her, causing it to wrap around the trunk.* "Your petty combination of attacks are nothing on me-"

*Tara pulled the whip forward, causing her to suddenly sway in the air, as if she was riding a vine.*

Nathan: *He looked up, staring at Tara with a frown.* (She simply threw herself into the air?)

Champion: "Icy swirls call down upon me, frigid skies grant me power-" *A blue glyph drew itself on the ground around her.*

Tara: *She eased her grip on the whip, causing it to let go of the tree before it hit the ground.* "..."

Nathan: *He covered his face, as a pulse of dirt blew around the tree.* (Damn-)

Tara: *She flicked the whip upwards, causing it to suddenly grab onto the air, as if it wrapped around an invisible branch.* "Fufufu." *She swung on the whip and glided over the party, smirking at them in a taunt-like manner.*

Nathan: (She's swinging on the whip? But it's holding onto nothing?!)

Tara: *She spiralled in the air and elegantly landed on the ground in front of Luna.* "Now, let me know what you taste like!"

?????: *She watched Tara ready herself to hurt Luna, causing her to hiss in fear.* "Yeu!"

Luna: "It's OK-" *She whispered to the Scoldrant, as if she didn't know Tara was standing directly in front of her.*

Trevour: "DUST STORM" *He punched the ground again, causing Tara to chuckle.*

Tara: "It's too late!" *She swayed the whip towards Luna, watching it slither towards her face in slow motion.*

Champion: "ICICLE EDGE" *She shouted with an echoing voice, watching large thick ice spears materialise in the air above Tara.*

Nathan: *He opened his eyes, staring at the whip with widening eyes.* "Luna!-"

Luna: "Ah!-" *She squinted her eyes, holding the Scoldrant close to her chest.*

*A swirl of dust erupted up in front of Luna, causing the whip to twirl inside it.*

Tara: "What-?"

Nathan: (Instead of attacking the woman, he used the Rostical in front of Luna for defensive purposes. Smart thinking!-)

Tara: "Hah!" *She flicked her wrist, causing the swirling dirt to explode around her whip.*

Luna: "Ah?" *She felt the dirt rain on her in shock.*

Tara: "Tssk-" *She looked up and casually swayed to each side, avoiding the falling ice spears.*

Champion: (Don't underestimate my Rasticplash!-)

*The ice spears suddenly exploded into glaciers of ice, slashing Tara across the neck.*

Tara: "Agh!" *She stumbled back, surprised.*

Trevour: *He started to pant, causing him to move more sluggish.*

Nathan: (The champion takes longer to attack, but is powerful, while Trevour is able to use his Rostical more frequently, at the cost of being obviously drained of his Neurons-)

Tara: *She stumbled out of the ice and flicked her wrist, causing the whip to shatter the ice to one side.* "How embarrassing-" *She spoke to herself, touching the cut on her neck.*

Trevour: "We may be weaker than you, but together, we're going to give you some major turbulence."

Luna: (Turbulence? Even trying to taunt the crazy bitch, he'll never be kool.)

Nathan: *He started to run towards Tara, firmly holding onto the sword.* (I need to give it my all!-) "Champion, Trevour, give me some support!"

Champion: "Only support? Of course."

Trevour: "No worries, sir!"

Tara: *She flicked the ice off the whip and faced Nathan, looking unimpressed.* "What do you hope to do to me?"

Nathan: "Air Slash-" *He swayed up, slicing a visible air slash towards Tara.*

Tara: *She glanced at Nathan with double vision.* (What?!) *She swayed to the side, closely avoiding the air slash.*

Nathan: (Almost!-) *He ran around Tara, focusing all her attention on to him.* "Air Slash."

Tara: (I don't believe this, but-) *She swayed the whip to the side and broke the visible air slash, causing a violent gust of wind to blow her ponytail back.* (I might have to retreat..-)

*A fireball suddenly hit the back of Tara, causing her to gasp in pain.*

Champion: "Oh my? You're getting slower?"

Trevour: "Unlike us, looks like she hasn't had a good night's rest."

Tara: "Shut-" *She quickly ducked under Nathan's sword.*

Nathan: "..." *He slashed downwards, watching Tara block it with her whip.*

Tara: "I'll be back, you dirty lamps!" *She screamed and leant forward, pushing Nathan back with her whip.*

Nathan: *He watched sparks splinter in between his sword and her whip, as he slid back on his feet.* (I know captains are powerful, but she hasn't even broken a sweat-)

Tara: "I thought I could kill you all with ease..." *She glared at the champion and slowly stepped away from the party.* "But, having the Battling Oxident's champion on your side.."

*Tara spat on the ground and turned around, flashstepping out of sight, leaving behind a slight buzzing sound.*

Nathan: (She's so fast, the quality of her flashstep is different from the others.)

Trevour: "Phew-" *He dropped to his knees, causing his armour to rattle.* "Is everyone okay?"

Nathan: *He sheathed his sword behind his back and slowly walked towards the party.* "I'm fine."

Champion: "So am I."

Trevour: "Luna?" *He looked at Luna, noticing she sat silently with an emotionless face.*

Luna: "Umm, yea..." *She stroked the Scoldrant, unknowingly leaving smears of blood on her fur.*

?????: "Yeup." *She shook, swaying the dirt out of her fur.*

Trevour: *He walked closer to Luna and leant in shock.* "Blood?" (One of them is hurt!)

?????: "Yeup?"

Luna: "Oh yea, the whip jabbed me-" *She awkwardly smiled and opened her hand, revealing blood everywhere.*

Champion: "Oh my-" *She covered her mouth with both hands.*

Trevour: "M-Madam!" *He quickly hobbled towards Luna.*

Champion: "She chose to protect the Scoldrant over her own well-being." *She whispered to herself.*

?????: (Yeup?) *She discreetly glanced at the champion with heightened hearing.*

Nathan: (I may not want to be a Scoldrant User, but I really respect when people care for Scoldrants to the point of-)

Luna: "I-I feel weak-" *She sighed on her breath and became limp, causing her to lean on one side.*

Trevour: "N-No! Madam!" *He bent down and felt her neck, causing him to nod his head.* "She's unconscious."

Nathan: "I could've told you that."

Champion: *She looked around, observing the empty landscape.* "What a horrible place to receive a wound."

Trevour: "We'd have to walk hours back, or-"

Nathan: "We could carry her and make our way through the forest?"

Champion: "I actually don't need to go right away." *She turned around, facing the forests.*

Nathan: "..."

Champion: *She looked back to the party.* "I'll continue half way, then I'll go into The Twilight Forest."

Trevour: (Unfortunately, at this rate, we'll need to rest for quite some time.) *He frowned in thought, as if he didn't want to stop.* (We can't let her wounds get infected here of all places.)

?????: "Yeup?" *She hopped away from Luna, staring at her in a worried-like manner.*

Trevour: "Alright, prepare for some turbulence, Luna-" *He attempted to pick her up, causing Nathan to chuckle.*

Nathan: "Umm, here-" *He walked past Trevour and offered to carry Luna.*

Trevour: "Much appreciated, sir."

Nathan: *He turned around and lifted Luna up, carrying her on his back.* "Ahh-, can you get the sword-?"

Trevour: *He reached in between Luna and Nathan, gently pulling the sword out.* "Phew, all good, sir."

Champion: "Let's begin it." *She smiled with her eyes shut.*

Trevour: "We go North." *He smiled and started to walk towards the trees, glancing to each side.* "It's funny how you can tell which trees belong to which forest."

Champion: "Umm? Oh my, I'm sorry. I don't find that funny at all." *She spoke in an oblivious, innocent-like manner.*

Trevour: "I didn't mean...-"

Nathan: *He walked through the naturally made separation of the two forests.* (I wonder when she hurt herself?)

*Nathan glanced at Luna's hair, recalling the entire fight with Tara.*

Nathan: (Everything happened so fast-) *He looked ahead, noticing an abandoned hut.* "Wow, look at that."

Trevour: "Excellent spotting, sir." *He smiled at the hut.*

Champion: "What a fantastic place to rest Luna in."

Nathan: "That's what I was thinking."

Trevour: "I'll have a quick look and see if it's safe from anything."

Nathan: "Right." *He watched Trevour hobble towards the hut.*

Champion: (Sometimes there are nasty little Scoldrants that make homes in abandoned places.)

Nathan: "Do you think it's bad?" *He looked at the champion.* "There was a lot of blood."

Champion: *She shook her head.* "She's hurt, but I don't sense a disturbance with her life Neurons."

Nathan: "Cool.."

Champion: *She sighed, looking up to the treetops.* "That warrior was quite frightening, no?"

Nathan: *He silently nodded his head with a frown.* (I need to get stronger.. I self-taught myself a lot of skills, but in comparison.. I need to learn advanced captain techniques, like flashstepping, concealing my weapon, Ougi-)

Trevour: "All clear in here!" *He poked his head out of the hut, glancing at Nathan and the champion.*

?????: "Yeup.." *She hopped after the party, catching the champion's attention.*

Champion: *She turned around, noticing the Scoldrant.* "Oh my, look who followed us."

Nathan: "... We'll rest here."

Trevour: "But then sun-?"

Nathan: "They'll be no point in going to Silver Wind Island if she dies from infection."

Trevour: "I understand, but-"

Nathan: "Do you really? Look at her eyes."

Trevour: "You aren't looking at the bigger picture, sir-"

Nathan: "Okay, okay. We go straight to Silver Wind Island. Find a healer, and-... It's too late.."

Champion: *She hobbled forward, holding the Scoldrant in her arms.* "I agree with you both."

Trevour: "So-"

Champion: "But I agree with Nathan. Unless they have a powerful Radiaton filled healer. It is very hard to heal something that has been festering for too long.."

Nathan: "See?"

Trevour: "..."

Nathan: "But I happen to agree with you.."

Trevour: "You do?"

Nathan: "If she dies, this whole trip is meaningless."

Trevour: *He nodded his head and stepped away from the hut.* "There's a small bed, and some weapons."

Champion: "That seems a little too convenient, doesn't it?"

Nathan: "Yeah, did you check for traps?"

Trevour: "This looks like a small checkpoint for warriors to rest at. It's safe."

Nathan: "That's all I needed to hear." *He walked into the hut and gently placed Luna on the bed, before stepping out.*

Trevour: *He looked up, staring at the swaying treetops.* "This place gives me the creeps."

Champion: "Trevour-"

Trevour: "Yes, madam?"

Champion: "Would you like to explain more about this Tara lady?"

Nathan: "Yeah-" *He grabbed the sword off Trevour and tied it around his back, before placing his hands on his head.*

Trevour: "The reason I know a lot about her is because my former captain spied on The Black Brigade."

Nathan: "Spied on your own? Just went I think you warriors couldn't get any lower-"

Trevour: "He did it for a good cause."

Champion: "Where is this captain now?"

Trevour: "He was in the rankings for many many years... But he was only my captain for a few."

Nathan: "How many years is many many?"

Trevour: "I'm not sure, sir. He definitely used Astragons to slow down his aging process."

Champion: "Where is he now?"

Trevour: "He escaped with the number one captain at the time.. I don't know where he is now."

Nathan: "So he was spying on his comrades, continue?"

Trevour: "You have captain classed warriors from number one to nine."

Champion: (Captain warriors are single digit warriors pretty much-)

Trevour: "What he found out, is that there's another addition of warriors."

Nathan: "Another addition?"

Trevour: "The Black Brigade. Their power rivals those in the top three."

Champion: "That can't be possible."

Trevour: "Champion?"

Champion: "If that woman was in the top three of ranking, we wouldn't have survived."

Nathan: (She was powerful, but she wasn't top three in ranking.)

Trevour: "I'm not too sure."

----------

*Tara suddenly appeared on top of a grassy hill, looking down to an enormous meadow below.*

Tara: "How dare-"

*Tara dropped to her knees and took deep breaths.*

Tara: "I thought this was going to be an easy task.. Someone of my power...-"

?????: "What's happening?"

*A man dressed in the same coloured leather as Tara appeared behind her.*

Tara: *She noticed a distinctive faint buzzing sound, causing her eyes to widen.* "Tyson, Quintess and Synthoss are out on mission. Is that Blake or Zazark?"

?????: "Bitch please-"

Tara: (Blake.)

Blake: "I like, heard about your little mission. Where are they?" *He folded his arms and leant to one side, smirking as if he knew she failed.*

Tara: "I underestimated the entire situation."

Blake: "Fufufu, are you telling me, you lost to fodder?"

Tara: "Shut up."

Blake: "Fufu! Wat a turn off." *He giggled like a girl and shook his head in disappointment.*

Tara: *She stood up and turned around, facing a slender man with charcoal coloured hair and eyes.* "I will not fail next time-"

Blake: "Bitch, please." *He sighed and looked at his fingers, observing nail polish on them.* "I've already sent Zazark."

Tara: "But how-?"

Blake: "Bitch, I am the leader of the brigade, rite?"

Tara: "Right." *She gritted her teeth and lowered her head in respect.*

Blake: "Next time, not matter how ugly or pitiful they are, don't fail." *He turned around, causing his leather garments to make stretching sounds.* "You'll give us a bad name, fufufu."

Tara: "..."

Blake: "And like, remove your Neuron limiter next time." *He hissed in disgust and leant forward, flashstepping out of Tara's sight.*

Tara: "My Neuron limiter?" *She looked down, noticing a black tattoo-like glyph on her wrist.*

*Tara gasped with a widening smirk, as if she just remembered.*

Tara: "I had my limiter on while I was interrogating those commoners! If I don't, I'd kill them with one hit of my whip! How foolish of me!"

*Tara placed two fingers on the glyph and pushed down, causing the glyph to suddenly splinter off her skin.*

Tara: *She slowly inhaled and stood up straight, puffing out her chest in confidence.* "I was fighting them with half my strength, fufufu.. If Zazark doesn't do the job, it won't be the last time they'll see me..."

----------

*Luna slowly opened her eyes and blindly looked up, staring out into nothing.*

Luna: (I still can't see...) *She sighed and plopped her arm out, causing her to accidentally knock something off the wall.*

*Luna gasped with widening eyes and awkwardly leant over the side of the bed, blindly reaching out.*

Luna: (Wat did I just knock-?)

*Lune felt around and tried not to fall off the bed, suddenly grasping a piece of wood.*

Luna: (Ah!-) *She lifted her arm and attempted to place the item back on the wall.* (It feels like some sort of wooden decoration-)

*Luna stopped in mid-thought as soon as she felt a string, causing her to sit up on the side of the bed.*

Luna: (A string?) *She lowered the item and started to inspect it again.* (It's a bow...)

*Luna smirked with nostalgia and stood up off the bed, stepping forward.*

Luna: (This is kool-) *She face palmed the door, causing her to grunt in frustration.*

Nathan: "So there're six members?"

Trevour: "I think so. There's an average of five members."

Champion: "Why do you look so concerned, Trevour?"

Trevour: "They operate outside the rankings."

Nathan: "What's so special about that?"

Trevour: "I heard they can get away with a lot of naughty things-"

*Luna suddenly barged out of the hut, falling face-first into the ground.*

Trevour: "Luna?" *He looked at Luna with a puzzled smile.*

Champion: "That's a way to get noticed." *She smiled with her eyes slightly squinted.*

?????: "Yeup." *She easily jumped out of the champion's arms and hopped towards Luna.*

Nathan: "Why are you up?"

Luna: "Because I'm no longer asleep? Wat a stupid answer, dipshit."

Nathan: "Fine, last time I'll care."

Trevour: *He noticed the bow in Luna's hand, causing him to look intrigued.* "How interesting, madam."

Luna: "Madam? That's me, aye?"

Champion: "Oh dear." *She stared at Luna with a smile.*

Trevour: "Ahem. Yes." *He coughed to clear his throat.*

Luna: "I found a bow-"

*A rack of arrows suddenly fell out of the hut, rolling across Luna's legs.*

Luna: "And some arrows!"

Trevour: "Heh heh."

Champion: *She smiled.* "..."

Nathan: "You need some rest."

Luna: "Settle down, mother. I can rest without sleep ya know."

Champion: "During the busy times of Battling Oxident, the only rest I get is by taking some time to myself."

Nathan: "..."

Luna: *She awkwardly leant up, blindly trying to collect the arrows.* "I don't mind a rest.. But I ain't sleepin'."

?????: "Yeup..." *She hopped up to Luna and started to rub herself against her leg.*

Luna: *She listened to the Scoldrant purr, causing her to giggle.* "'Sup, hairball?"

Nathan: *He stared at the bow and arrows in Luna's hand.* "Does anyone know archery?"

Trevour: "Negative, sir."

Champion: *She shook her head.* "No, I don't sorry."

Nathan: "Drop the weapon and get some rest-"

Luna: "Don't tell me what to do!"

Nathan: "No!-"

?????: "Hsssssk!" *She angrily hissed at Nathan, causing him to pause.*

Trevour: "Perhaps leave her to do her own thing?"

Nathan: "Whatever." *He sighed and looked at Trevour, as if he no longer cared.* "Tell me more about the warriors."

Trevour: "Well, each captain has their own ability."

Champion: *She hobbled up to Luna and smiled at the Scoldrant.* "She has taken a shine to you, hasn't she?"

?????: "Yeup." *She purred in agreement.*

Luna: "Yea." *She looked up, staring in the champion's general direction.*

Champion: "Are you hurt?"

Luna: "Nah, not really. I was more weakened if anythin' aye."

Champion: "She took some of your Neurons?"

Luna: "Yea. If I had to describe the feelin', that's what I would be."

Champion: (How odd. If she doesn't have Neurons to use Rostical.. She should've died by that attack..)

?????: "Yeup.." *She purred in Luna's arms.*

Luna: "Aha, settle the fudge down, girl."

Champion: "Looks like you saved each other."

Luna: "Aye?"

?????: "Yeup?"

Champion: "It's the first time I've seen you actually smile..."

Luna: "..."

?????: "Y-Yeu...." *She meowed to herself, suddenly triggering a flow of flashbacks.*

----------

Luna: "Oi! Why you pickin' on it!" *She shouted and stormed towards the hairballs, catching their attention.*

?????: "Hsssht!" *It hissed, glaring at Luna with its large bug-like eyes.*

Luna: "Gaghraghr, yaself!" *She screamed and quickly picked up a rock, instantly throwing it towards them.*

?????: *The rock hit one of the hairballs and broke into crumbs on dirt, causing it to squeal in fright.* "Hierrrk."

Luna: "How you like bein' picked on, aye?!" *She screamed and picked up another rock, trying to intimidate the hairballs.*

*The hairballs meowed and hissed, quickly floating into the distance out of Luna's sight.*

Luna: "Yea, that's what I thought, dipshits!"

--

Trevour: "Luna?" *He looked at Luna, noticing she sat silently with an emotionless face.*

Luna: "Umm, yea..." *She stroked the Scoldrant, unknowingly leaving smears of blood on her fur.*

?????: "Yeup." *She shook, swaying the dirt out of her fur.*

Trevour: *He walked closer to Luna and leant back in shock.* "Blood?" (One of them is hurt!)

?????: "Yeup?"

Luna: "Oh yea, the whip jabbed me-" *She awkwardly smiled and opened her hand, revealing blood everywhere.*

Champion: "Oh my-"

Trevour: "M-Madam!" *He quickly hobbled towards Luna.*

Champion: "She chose to protect the Scoldrant over her own well-being." *She whispered to herself.*

?????: (Yeup?) *She discreetly glanced at the champion with heightened hearing.*

--

Luna: "Nah, not really. I was more weakened if anythin' aye."

Champion: "She took some of your Neurons?"

Luna: "Yea. If I had to describe the feelin', that's what I would be."

Champion: "..."

?????: "Yeup.." *She purred in Luna's arms.*

Luna: "Aha, settle the fudge down, girl."

Champion: "Looks like you saved each other."

Luna: "Aye?"

?????: "Yeup?"

Champion: "It's the first time I've seen you actually smile..."

Luna: "..."

----------

?????: "Yeu-eu-"

Luna: "Aye? Is somethin' wrong-?" *A heartbeat-like pulse thumped through her body, causing her to gasp in shock.*

Champion: "Luna-?"

*Luna and the Scoldrant suddenly panted in exhaustion, causing the champion to step back in a worried-like manner.*

Champion: "N-Nathan, Trevour.." *Her voice filled with concern caught their attention.*

Luna: "Wat's goin' on?"

????: "Yeup?"

Nathan: *He stood next to the champion, observing Luna in confusion.* "What's happening?"

Champion: "I was hoping you could tell me-"

Luna: "Gah-?!" *She suddenly leant back in pain.*

Trevour: "Is the Scoldrant hurting her-?!"

Nathan: "No..." *He intensely stared at the Scoldrant, as if he had an idea of what was happening.*

Luna: *She suddenly shut her eyes and squinted them in pain.* (It burns...)

Champion: "Oh my, they're even breathing at the same time?"

Luna: "Somethin' burns!"

?????: "Yeup?!" *She hissed, as if she was in pain too.*

Trevour: "Separate them!-"

?????: (Why?) *Her voice echoed in Luna's mind, causing her to gasp with her eyes still shut.*

Luna: (Is that-..?)

?????: (Why did you...)

Luna: (Because you were in pain...)

?????: (I feel your pain too, yeup.) *Transparent blue strings suddenly shot out of her body, causing Nathan to gasp with widening eyes.*

Trevour: "What are-?"

Nathan: "Soul Link?" *He suddenly held the side of his head in pain.*

Champion: (It looks like his memories are finally coming back to him-)

?????: *The blue strings connected into Luna, causing them both to gasp with pleasure and pain.* "Yuew..."

Luna: (I can feel wat you're feeling-) *She hissed in pain, placing one hand on her thigh.* (Something burns!-)

?????: "Yeuuuuuu-" *She suddenly opened her eyes, causing a purple iris to spiral around her pupils.*

Luna: (Gah-?) *She noticed sketch-like figures of the environment, causing her to gasp.*

Nathan: "They Soul Linked. A special bond between Scoldrant and their User..." *He gritted his teeth and slightly bent his knees, as if the pain grew in strength.*

Trevour: "A Soul Link?"

Champion: "They're calming down now..."

Luna: *She glanced at each party member, observing their sketch-like silhouettes in shock.* "Trevour.."

Trevour: "Yes, are you okay-?!"

Luna: "You're kinda pudgy.. And champion, I never knew how big that hunchback of yours was."

Trevour: "Heh heh. You can't fool me again-"

Champion: "You can see us?"

Trevour: "What-?" *He looked at the champion with a fading smile.*

Luna: "I can see black and white sketches-" *She blinked several times.*

?????: "Yeu?"

Nathan: "A Soul Link is a rare and special link.. It raises each recipient's attributes, including longevity."

Trevour: "Wow."

Champion: (Things like this could happen without us even knowing about it..)

Nathan: "There were cases of Soul Links, repairing unfixable damage on either Scoldrant and human."

Trevour: *He looked at Luna in understanding.* "That's how-"

Luna: "I can see-" *She awkwardly stood up and looked around, watching the trees sway in the wind.*

?????: *She heard a noise and turned around, causing Luna to suddenly collapse on one side.* "Yeu?"

Champion: "What happened?"

Luna: "My eyes... I didn't turn and I can see behind-?"

Nathan: "Unless a wound is too badly damaged, it's possible to share senses." *He dropped to his knees, squinting his eyes in pain.*

Luna: "I can see wat you're seein'?"

?????: "Yeu?" *She looked at Luna.*

Luna: (Is this wat I look like?) *She gently touched her face, observing the old black makeup smears on her cheeks.* (There's blood... Why hasn't anyone said anythin'.. I look disgusting.)

Nathan: "Memories-..." *He wheezed and collapsed to one side, catching Trevour and the champion's attention.*

Trevour: "Nathan-?"

Champion: "It looks like he couldn't handle most of his memories returning at once."

Nathan: "S-Soul Link.. Scoldrant Users..." *He sighed on his breath, as he slowly fell unconscious.*

Luna: "Umm-" *She slowly stood back up, glancing at Nathan.*

?????: "Yeup." *She hopped up, suddenly landing on Luna's shoulder.* "Yuw?" *She sounded surprised.*

Luna: "I can feel your emotions.. You're surprised 'cause you weren't expectin' to jump so high?"

?????: "Yeup!" *She purred in agreement.*

Trevour: *He tried to pull Nathan up, causing him to wheeze in a defeated-like manner.* "H-He's heavy."

Luna: "He is?" *She looked at Nathan, as if he didn't look heavy.*

Champion: "It's probably muscle."

Luna: "So wat are we gonna do then?"

Trevour: "Unlike you, we can't carry him to Silver Wind Island-"

Champion: "And what about your wounds, Luna?"

Luna: "They don't hurt as much as they did a minute ago."

Trevour: "Blast the Astragons.. Looks like we're staying here for a little while." *He sighed to himself, as if he wanted to keep moving forward.*

Champion: "Even though it's still daylight, perhaps we should set camp."

Luna: "Why?"

Trevour: "We certainly aren't walking remotely near The Twilight Forest at night."

Luna: "Wateva."

Champion: "It is dangerous."

Trevour: "You don't have to burden yourself with us, madam."

Champion: "Oh my, it's fine." *She smiled, as if she didn't care.*

Trevour: "Well, I'm good at setting camp. I've gone on a lot of missions out in the wilderness."

Luna: *She noticed Nathan's awkward posture.* "I'll make get him more comfortable."

Trevour: "I'll get the firewood."

Champion: "And I'll light the fire." *She smiled and clicked her finger, causing a flame to swirl in the air.*

Luna: (Wow..) *She stared at the sketch-like flames in amazement, as if it was the first time seeing it.*

?????: "Yeup!"

Luna: "Wow, I can understand-" *She whispered to herself in amazement.* "Ah, she says there's a lot of dead firewood that way-" *She pointed behind her, causing Trevour to change his direction.*

Trevour: "Much appreciated, heh heh."

Luna: *She slowly walked towards Nathan, as she was guided by the Scoldrant's sight.* "And everyone was worried about me, aye-"

Champion: *She watched Luna move Nathan's arms, making him more comfortable.* "It was like destiny that you two met."

Luna: (He is heavy-) "You think?"

Champion: *She nodded her head.* "Not many people are blessed to Soul Link with a Scoldrant while not having the blood."

Luna: "Aha, yea."

?????: "Yeup."

Champion: "Isn't-..." *She stared at the Scoldrant with a blank look on her face.* "What is her name?"

Luna: "Aye?"

?????: "Yew, yeup." *She purred, causing Luna to look surprised.*

Champion: "What did she say? I wouldn't be surprised if it sounded tribal-like-"

Luna: "She doesn't have one-"

Champion: "Oh my."

Luna: "Well... Would you like a name?"

?????: "Yeu?"

Luna: "Better than callin' you furball, aye?"

?????: "Yeup!" *She purred in agreement, causing Luna to chuckle.*

Champion: "Oh my, what will you name her?"

Luna: "Well... When you think about it, it kinda was destiny, aye."

Champion: *She smiled with her eyes closed, nodding her head.* "If you didn't find an attachment with the Scoldrant, if you didn't get struck by Rostical, turning you blind... Meeting up now, I wouldn't know what else to call it."

Luna: "Then, I'd like ya to meet Destiny." *She smirked and looked at the Scoldrant with anticipation, as if she was waiting for her response.*

Destiny: "Yeup!" *She hopped on Luna's shoulder, showing her enthusiasm to her new name.*

Champion: "Well?"

Luna: "Aha. She likes it."

Champion: "Oh my, that's splendid-"

Trevour: *He hobbled out from the trees, dragging a large sack of sand over his shoulder.* "How is he, everyone?"

Champion: *She looked down, noticing Nathan sleeping in a comfortable position.* "He's no longer making sounds of pain."

Trevour: "That's good to hear, miss."

Luna: "Wat's with that on your shoulder?"

Trevour: "Heh heh, very funny-"

Luna: "Umm, wat?"

Trevour: (Oh, she can see now-) "Instead of taking multiple trips, I figured I could grab all the firewood with a sand-made sack."

Champion: "What an excellent idea of making use of your Rostical."

Luna: "Wouldn't that take a lot of Astragongs to hold sand together?"

Champion: "That's right."

Trevour: "Yeah, heh heh." *He spoke with a struggle and dropped the sack on the ground, causing it to burst into sand.*

Luna: *She watched the sand grain on to the ground, revealing a large stack of thick wood.* "Kool."

Trevour: "This would've been much easier if we had one of those RPG bags."

Luna: "They're those bags that can store things limitless, aye?"

Champion: "You're right again, Luna."

Luna: "I always am." *She sniffed and pretended to be cool.*

Trevour: "Even if he wakes up, it would be wise to wait it out tonight."

Luna: *She looked up, watching sketch-like images of the tree branches sway in the wind.* "Fairo."

Champion: "FLAME BOLT" *She gently pushed forward, shooting off a small ball of flames into the wood.*

Trevour: *He watched the fire intensify, causing him to shuffle closer towards it.* "I like the fire."

Luna: "I don't."

Champion: "How come?" *She hobbled closer to the fire and sat down.*

Luna: "It's easier to get warmer than to get colder."

Trevour: (Keeping a consistent hold of the sand really puffed me out-) *He wiped his sweat and collapsed onto his back.*

Champion: "Will we have to worry about Tara again?"

Trevour: "We will. But not for now."

Luna: "So that crazy bitch will be after us again?"

Trevour: "I'm afraid so, madam."

Champion: (Oh my...)

Destiny: "Yeu..." *She meowed with lowering morale.*

Luna: "Oh, by the way, this is Destiny. Destiny, this is Trevor."

Trevour: "Trev-our."

Luna: "Wateva."

Destiny: "Yeup."

Trevour: (Heh heh, what a prankster.) *He smiled, looking at Destiny.* "Destiny was it?"

Destiny: "Yeup."

Trevour: "That's a majestic name, heh heh." *He chuckled with a smile.* "It's a sincere pleasure to meet you."

Destiny: "Yeup!"

Trevour: "I also wanted to thank you with the firewood. It was in the exact direction Luna led me to."

Destiny: "Yeup." *She purred in appreciation.*

Luna: "Oi, where's my thanks?"

Trevour: "And thank you to you too, madam."

Luna: "Damn right, Rusty."

Nathan: "Zzzz." *He snorted in his sleep, causing the champion to smile.*

Luna: (I dunno if it's 'cause I did somethin' with Destiny. But, I'm drained.) *She slowly lay on her back, causing Destiny to hop onto her stomach.*

Champion: (These captains are getting more and more dangerous by the minute.. An ability to not only absorb one's Neurons, but the Neurons out of Rostical too..)

*The champion recalled the time when Tara absorbed her flames and ice.*

Champion: (If only I was able to go back home.. I could tell everyone about the threat that lurks under the Consultant's authority.)

Chapter 6: The Ruins of Estel

Lezard: "As the party walked down an ancient-like road, they noticed two glowing pillars in the distance-" *He clapped his hands and giggled, glancing at Rachael and Twortz.*

Rachael: "That looks like a city." *She smiled with hope and looked at Lezard, waiting for his response.*

Lezard: "Indeedly-do, it is."

Twortz: *She waddled to each side, unintentionally dragging her feet.* (So hot, so weak... I feel sick.. I'm not used to walking this much! I need a car-)

Lezard: "How exciting, we're finally here, little monsters." *He giggled and swayed his bottom to each side.*

Rachael: *She smiled, walking with boosted morale.* "It's pretty quiet."

Twortz: "Hopefully your father can give us answers-"

Lezard: *He instantly noticed damaged ruins in the city's courtyard, causing him to hobble ahead of the girls.* "This can't be right.."

Rachael: "Lezard?" *She started to walk faster.*

Lezard: *He stepped into the courtyard and froze, glancing to each side in despair.* "I don't believe it."

Rachael: *She stopped next to Lezard and observed the area with him.* "What happened?"

Twortz: "You don't need me to tell you, that a great battle happened here once." *She staggered behind Rachael, having the opportunity to take deep relaxed breaths.*

Lezard: "This city once endured a great battle.." *He started to walk across the courtyard, talking in recollection.*

Twortz: *She heard the change of tone in footsteps, causing her to look down.* (Glass?)

Rachael: "It sounds interesting."

Lezard: "This used to be the city of Valhalla."

Rachael: "Valhalla?"

Twortz: "Like Norse mythology?"

Lezard: "Before the lands rose into the air, the city was then owned by their cousins-" *He walked up to a wall and touched a large glyph.* (Nothing-)

Twortz: (In the air?) *She looked up and squinted her eyes, staring at the blue sky with distant white puffy clouds.*

Rachael: "Who were their cousins?"

Lezard: "The Elementalists."

Twortz: "..."

Lezard: *He started to walk towards castle-like ruin, causing Rachael and Twortz to follow.* "Some time later, this city was rebuilt by the amazing-"

Twortz: "How was this city rebuilt if I'm clearly looking at ruins?"

Lezard: "Exactly my current dilemma, Twortz."

Rachael: "It seems abandoned."

Lezard: *He touched a sigil-like glyph on the ruins.* (As I feared.. Nothing is responding.. Even to my Radiatons-)

Rachael: "So, besides the history, not that I understand any of it. What's your connection?"

Lezard: "One of the founders that helped build this city was my mother and father. It was later named, The Ruins of Estel."

Twortz: "So this city has different names?"

Lezard: "Glad you're keeping up."

Twortz: "..." *She frowned and watched Lezard walk further into the ruins.*

Lezard: "Dad?!" *He shouted out, glancing to each side.* "Father monster?!"

Rachael: "I don't like to assume, but looking at the damage to this city-"

Lezard: "Bwarharh, don't fret Razzypoo, my father can't be defeated so easily."

Rachael: (Lezard sounds very sure of himself.)

Twortz: "So, we spent all this time walking here, only to find ruins." *She placed her hands behind her back.*

Lezard: "Not everything I do revolves around you." *He spoke in a carefree manner, continuing to aimlessly glance around the city.*

?????: "People?"

*A little boy's voice caught Lezard, Twortz and Rachael's attention.*

Twortz: "Who the devil-?" *She waddled around and stared at a young boy in shock.*

Rachael: "Who are you?"

Lezard: "Wowza, what happened here, little monster-?"

Boy: "W-W-?" *He dropped a mouldy loaf of bread and staggered back, before suddenly running away.*

Rachael: "Wait!-"

Lezard: "We're not an enemy-" *He started to hobble after the boy.*

Twortz: *She took several steps forward and bent down, taking a deep breath.* "Stuff-, this-"

Rachael: *She hopped to the side, allowing her to glance at Twortz.* "Twortz?"

Twortz: "Go! He might know what happened!"

Rachael: *She nodded her head and started to run after Lezard and the boy.* (Now we're chasing a kid in a city full of ruin-)

Lezard: "Please wait. Have you seen a sensational man with a cone-shaped-?"

Rachael: *She easily caught up to Lezard, watching the boy run to a dead end.* "He can't move now-"

Boy: *He ran directly towards the dead end and started to sway his arms in a dancer-like manner, causing an aura made path to appear in front of him.* "L-Leave me alhone!"

*The boy squealed and started to run up the aura made path, causing it to slowly fade behind him.*

Lezard: *He quickly jumped up and missed the aura path as it faded out of his reach.* "Blast-"

Rachael: *She continued to sprint towards the boy.* "Rock Pillar." *She swayed her arm up, causing a small pillar of rock to erupt under her feet, blasting her up into the air.*

Boy: *He ran on top of a rock balcony and continued to run.* "Stahp!"

Rachael: "Rock Pillar." *She landed on a rock wall and swayed her arms up, causing another eruption of rock to push her up onto the balcony.* (That was close-) "Stop!"

Boy: "How-?" *He glanced behind him in shock, as if he wasn't expecting Rachael to keep up.*

Rachael: "Lezard just wants to talk-"

Boy: *He started to skip, causing the surrounding area to respond to his movements.* (How is she keeping up!?)

Rachael: "Rock Pillar." *She swayed her arms up, causing a small pillar of rock to shoot up in front of the boy.*

Boy: "Huh?" *He hit the rock pillar, causing him to stumble back with an emotionless face in shock.*

Rachael: *She slowed down to a slight jog.* "Are you-?"

Boy: "Whaaaa!" *He started to cry, causing Rachael to look shocked and confused.*

Rachael: "I-I... Didn't mean-"

Boy: "Weave me alhone!" *He cupped his nose and dropped to the ground, curling up into a ball.*

Rachael: "I didn't want to-"

?????: "Fufufu." *A woman chuckled behind Rachael, catching her attention.*

Rachael: "Who's-?" *She turned around, staring at a woman dressed in tight red and black leather.* "Hello?"

Woman: "Hello."

Rachael: "I'm Rachael, who are you?"

Woman: "I'm known as Synthoss."

Rachael: "What are you-?"

Boy: "She bad, bad!"

Rachael: *She glanced at the boy, causing her to cautiously move away from Synthoss.* "How can I help you?"

Synthoss: "I'm here for the child."

Rachael: "Why?"

Synthoss: "We're usually sent to double check villages after an annihilation."

Rachael: "Double check what?"

Synthoss: "Survivors, witnesses, etcetera. We are the people that keep order, that keep the Consultant's good image."

Rachael: "What has that got to do with this boy?"

Synthoss: "The child, he ran away like a pitiful coward, and allowed his friends and family to be captured."

Rachael: "If he doesn't want to go, you can't force him-"

Synthoss: "Judging by the clothes you're wearing-, fufufu. You must be new around here.. I don't ask, I tell."

Rachael: "Too bad. Where I'm from, you never have the right to tell anybody anything."

Synthoss: "Looks like we've run into a problem."

Boy: *He sniffed and looked up, shaking his head.* "Y-Yooh don't have to... Run, while you still can."

Rachael: *She raised her fists and stood in a battle-ready pose.* "If you never stick up for what you believe in, then you'll always get walked over-"

Synthoss: "Fufufu." *She suddenly leapt forward, landing in striking distance.*

Rachael: (She jumped towards me in one jump-)

Synthoss: "Tah!-" *She punched towards Rachael's face.*

Rachael: *She punched her arm down, blocking Synthoss' fist in a karate-like manner.* "Hah!" *She swayed to the side, punching towards Synthoss' jaw.*

Synthoss: "Terh!-" *She kicked off the wall to her side, dodging Rachael's punch.*

Rachael: "Rock Pillar." *She punched to the side, causing a rock pillar to erupt up into Synthoss' leg.*

Synthoss: "Rostical?" *She stepped back and kicked the rock pillar, smashing it into pebbles.*

Rachael: (Whoa-)

Boy: (Remenistal? That didn't feel like Remenistal-?)

Synthoss: "Torh!" *She front flipped towards Rachael.*

Rachael: "Hehe-" *She jumped forward and slid on the ground, sweeping one foot to the side.*

Synthoss: *She front flipped in slow motion and stood on her hands, watching Rachael kick them.* "Tss-"

*Synthoss rolled to the side, causing Rachael to smirk in a victorious-like manner.*

Boy: (That girl is skilled-)

Synthoss: *She stood up and cracked her neck, placing one hand on a purple coloured whip on her thigh.*

Rachael: *She stood up straight and raised her fists, readying herself to fight.* "I've sparred with all sorts of weapons-"

Synthoss: *She quickly swayed her arm forward, causing the whip to slither past Rachael, smashing the balcony into the air.* "Fufufu."

Rachael: (A whip that explodes rock-?!) *She looked in front, watching Synthoss stare at her face to face.* "Wha-?"

Synthoss: *She suddenly kicked Rachael in the stomach, causing a loud bone to crack.* "Tarh!"

*Synthoss screamed in pain and stepped back, hopping on one foot.*

Rachael: *She looked shocked and touched her stomach, poking her finger into it.* "I didn't feel a thing-"

Boy: "Defence Up." *He squealed in shock, focusing on a small blue sigil-like glyph underneath Rachael.*

Synthoss: *She glared at the boy, as if she was ready to hurt him.* "You dare use your art on me?!"

Rachael: *She had a flashback of Synthoss kicking her rock pillar into pebbles.* (That could've crushed my lungs if that hit me-)

Synthoss: *She faced the boy and snapped the whip in front, causing the boy to jump in fright.* "I'm impressed someone of your age is even able to connect their Astragons and Neurons together-"

*Rachael's fist grazed past Synthoss' cheek, followed by a rock pillar which erupted up from behind.*

Rachael: "Ha!" *She spun around and kicked Synthoss on the knee she hurt.*

Synthoss: "Tah!" *She raised her sore leg off the ground and punched towards Rachael.*

Rachael: *She quickly ducked under Synthoss' fist and kicked her in the stomach, knocking her into the rock pillar.* "Hah!"

Synthoss: *She elbowed the pillar behind her and cracked it.* "Fool-"

Rachael: "Hah!" *She swayed to the side and kicked Synthoss further back, smashing the rock pillar behind her.*

Synthoss: *She backflipped and landed on one knee, taking advantage of the dirt cloud.* "I'll show her-"

Boy: *He started to dance and kicked the ground, causing an expanding orange glyph to form around his foot.* "Power Up."

Rachael: *She watched the glyph spiral underneath her, filling her with a sudden drive.* (This feeling!)

Synthoss: (I'll charge a little but of Neurons into this Azure Burst-) *Her body glowed a shade of blue.*

Rachael: *She swayed her arm, causing the dirt to suddenly blow back.* "Wow, I could feel the Earth in the dirt?"

Boy: "Urf?"

Synthoss: "No matter-" *She watched an orange aura sway around her purple whip, causing her to flick it towards Rachael.* "Neuronic Sap."

Rachael: *She punched up, causing a massive wall of sheetrock to erupt in front of her, cracking the entire balcony around her.* "Rock Pillar."

Synthoss: *She watched the whip hit the sheet rock and bounce back as if nothing happened.* "Hard-?"

----------

*Lezard and Twortz looked up, listening to the sound of cracking stone in a worried-like manner.*

Twortz: "What's happening up there?!"

Lezard: "Either, Razzypoo has found an enemy, or that boy is some crazy prodigy-"

Twortz: "We should help them-"

?????: "I don't think so, fufufu."

Lezard: "A woman dressed in tight red and black leather which compliments her sex appeal, stealthily crept up behind the party-" *He quickly wiped a stream of blood which randomly dripped out from his nose.*

?????: "The party?" *She glanced at Twortz and Lezard in confusion.* "There's just two of you."

Lezard: "I can feel your power-"

?????: "Good for you, I'm not even trying to hide it."

Twortz: "Explain yourself."

?????: "Fufufufu, that's no way to talk to a member of The Black Brigade."

Lezard: "Jinkies! Mount your battle stations!" *He whimpered and hobbled behind Twortz, shaking his bottom in a sarcastic-like manner.*

?????: "Trying to confuse me with such plain idiocy won't work."

Twortz: "You might second guess that when you realise he always acts like this."

Lezard: "Ouchies, snappy aren't we... Hungry?"

Twortz: *She raised the frying pan, standing in a battle-ready pose.* "Tssk..."

?????: "The irony? Hungry and a cooking utensil? Are you going to eat me?"

Lezard: "Bwarharh, for an enemy, you're hilarious!"

Twortz: "Who's side are you on?!"

Lezard: "Sorries! I'll help out if need be!"

?????: (With the recent power struggle with Blake and Tara, I'd never hear the end of it if I failed. Quintess this, Quintess that..) *She suddenly appeared directly in front of Twortz, smirking in a confident manner.*

Lezard: "A flashstep!-"

Quintess: (What's this chunky woman going to do-?) *She raised a fist, focusing on Twortz's throat.*

Twortz: "Sonic Rush." *She shouted with an echoing voice and slammed the frying pan on Quintess' face, blasting her back with a scattered shock wave.*

Quintess: *She slid back on her face, as she awkwardly rolled back in a tumble.* "Argh?!"

Twortz: "Stop making fun of my weight.." *She shouted, as all sounds around her amplified.*

Quintess: *She slowly stood up, touching her face in shock.* "I don't-... Believe it-"

Twortz: "Back away.. I feel very filthy and I'm not in a good mood-"

Quintess: *She suddenly appeared behind Twortz, punching towards the back of her neck.* "Not in a bad mood? I better leave then-"

*Lezard violently rolled across the ground, as if he was kicked.*

Twortz: "Yarh!-" *She awkwardly tilted her head back, inhaling in pain.* (That hurt! She punched? From behind-?)

Quintess: "Fufufu." *She pushed Twortz forward, forcing her across the ground.* "Can't say I've seen someone as fat as you go airborne before."

Twortz: *She tightened her grip around the frying pan before her shoulder violently tapped on the ground.* "-Ckee!"

*Twortz groaned in pain and tumbled across the ground, ripping the material around her elbows and knees.*

Twortz: "Ouch.."

Quintess: "You two are so weak, it was almost funny listening to you talk back to me."

Lezard: (She kicked me in mid flashstep? Ouchies! This hurts.) *His body uncontrollably twitched.*

----------

Rachael: *She stared at the rock pillar in shock, causing her to glance at the boy in confusion.* "Did you-?"

Boy: "She's a syngle digit! She'll come for us!" *He squealed in fear, alerting Rachael.*

Rachael: (She'll come for us?) *She touched the pillar and knocked on it, listening to the sound.* (It almost feels and sounds like limestone?)

Synthoss: *She smirked and her eyes suddenly cracked like glass.* "We may have the same weapons and Azure Bursts, but we possess completely different abilities and Ougis-"

Rachael: "I don't know what you're talking about, but how about leave us alone?!"

Synthoss: "AYON RAPTURE" *She placed her hand on the rock pillar and watched the air suddenly crack like glass, causing it to burst away from her.*

Rachael: "Ah!-" *She quickly swayed to the side, watching rocks blast past her face.* "How-?!"

Synthoss: *She jumped out of an expanding dirt cloud and flipped over Rachael, landing on the balcony.* "Fufufu!" *She suddenly leapt off the balcony, kicking Rachael across the face in mid-air.*

Rachael: "Ah-" *She leant in the direction Synthoss kicked her and frowned.*

*Rachael quickly regained her posture and punched up, upper cutting Synthoss as she was descending.*

Rachael: "Hah!" *She spun around and kicked Synthoss in the chest, knocking her over the balcony.*

Synthoss: "Time freeze, three inverted stars gather, AYON RAPTURE" *She swayed to the side and the area around Rachael cracked like glass, smashing the wall behind her.*

Boy: (N-No!-) *He quickly cowered back down, trembling in fear.*

Rachael: *She suddenly leant forward and sighed, struggling to stay on her feet.* (It felt like someone shattered a glass bottle across my chest..)

Synthoss: *She stood up straight and snapped the whip, causing it to wrap itself around Rachael's neck.*

Rachael: "Kah-?!"

Synthoss: "Making me use my ability.. Haven't used the royal blood in a while now."

Rachael: "Royal blood?" *She spoke with a struggle, trying to loosen the whip.*

Synthoss: "Fufufu, it's a rare bloodline ability which allows access to several abilities. My ability, once activated, multiplies my Rostical output by three times. So, my incantation boosted Rostical is almost tripled by six times! Fufufu."

Rachael: (I know I'm still learning, but that would explain how she was able to break through that rock pillar-)

Synthoss: "Despite how strong we are, I've learned to never underestimate an opponent."

Rachael: *She held the whip around her neck with both hands and awkwardly shuffled forward, attempting to kick Synthoss.* "Tssk-kst-"

Synthoss: "You really are persistent-" *Her eyes reverted back to normal.*

Rachael: "Tsssk-" *She continued to kick one foot in the air in a combo-like manner, as she slowly shuffled forward on one foot.*

Synthoss: "Fufu, you think I'd let you get close with my weapon?" *She flicked her wrist, causing the whip to extend, pushing Rachael against the wall behind her.*

Rachael: "Tsssk-"

Synthoss: "Now-.." *Her body glowed a shade of blue.*

Rachael: *She suddenly opened her eyes, as if she had an idea.* (What is this feeling?! Those words-?!) "Piercing Land."

*Rachael kicked the ground, causing a dagger sized shard of rock to shoot up by her side.*

Rachael: *She grabbed the dagger in mid-air, looking at it in confusion.* (What am I meant to do with this?!)

Synthoss: (Rostical?)

Boy: (Sh-She uses Remenistal... But it didn't feel like Remenistal?)

Synthoss: "Impressive." *She smirked at Rachael.*

Rachael: "Hah-ghk-" *She threw the rock, watching it slash past Synthoss' ear.*

Synthoss: *She suddenly glared at Rachael with killing intent.* "Neuronic Sap."

*An orange aura enveloped the whip and swirled downwards towards Rachael's neck.*

Rachael: "What is this cloudy stuff-?"

Synthoss: "You won't keep consciousness for long-" *She watched the aura suddenly turn red around Rachael's neck, before flowing back up towards Synthoss.*

Rachael: "I'm feeling.. Weak-" *She spoke on her breath and slowly lowered her arms, as if she couldn't hold them up anymore.*

----------

Quintess: "Now, we're here to collect a remaining dancer. Apparently, they hold more use to the Consultants than they originally thought."

Lezard: (So the Consultants were here-...) *He slowly stood up, glancing at Twortz lying on her side.* "Twortz!"

Twortz: *She opened her eyes and held onto the frying pan, slowly standing up.* "How did you move so fast?"

Lezard: "I've been hit by someone via flashstep before, but yours felt internal?" *He felt around his chest.*

Quintess: "Do you honestly believe I'll tell you my abilities and weaknesses?"

Lezard: "Abilities and weaknesses?"

Twortz: "I see. So, you have some sort of flashstepping ability."

Quintess: *She glared at Twortz, as if she was right.* "So I guess eating wasn't the only thing you excel in."

Twortz: *She firmly held onto the frying pan, as if she was building confidence.* "Take that back."

Quintess: "Watch your tongue!"

Twortz: "No."

Quintess: "So be it."

Lezard: "Quick internal light, INVOKING AURA"

*A swirl of warm light flashed around Twortz's chest, allowing her to breathe normally.*

Quintess: "Radiatons?!" *She quickly glared over her shoulder, staring at Lezard.*

Twortz: (Radiatons?)

Lezard: "J-Jinkies.." *He slowly shuffled back, as if he didn't like his sudden attention.*

Quintess: "Prepare to be purified." *She held onto a blue whip which hung off the side of her thigh.*

Twortz: "Excuse me?"

Quintess: "What do you-?" *She sighed and looked back in front, noticing Twortz waddling into striking distance.*

Twortz: "Sonic Rush." *She swayed the frying pan, blowing a scattered shock wave into Quintess' face.*

Quintess: *She smirked and watched the shock wave slip right through her, causing it to hit Lezard.* "Fufufu-"

Lezard: "Ah-?!" *He wailed in pain, dropping to his knees.*

Twortz: "How-?"

Lezard: (Her attack felt internal.. Twortz's attack somehow moved right through her..) "She has some sort of transparency ability!"

Twortz: "All my life I've been insulted.." *She frowned, as the air around her started to warp.*

Quintess: "I don't care about your life.. Mine wasn't easy too-"

Twortz: "I try to let it slide, I pretend like it doesn't hurt! I really try!" *She shouted, causing her screams to echo like thunder.*

Quintess: "Wow, does the food blow off your plate or what?"

Twortz: "It hurts!"

*The air started to visibly swirl around the frying pan.*

Quintess: "Then stop eating! It's so simple."

Twortz: *She glared at Quintess with watering eyes.* "Sonic Rush."

Lezard: (I thought she was just a meanie, but she holds so much pain..)

Twortz: "Hah!" *She ran around Quintess and swayed the frying pan, blowing a scattered shock wave towards her.*

Quintess: "Daathic Shattering." *She suddenly flicked the whip high above her and slammed it down, causing the ground to explode at the whip's tip.*

Twortz: *Shards of rock cut into her stomach.* "Ah-"

Quintess: "Does it hurt?" *She flicked the whip back into the air, smirking at Twortz's pain filled face.*

Twortz: "Not as much as it hurts inside."

Quintess: "Fufufufufufu!"

Lezard: "Quick healing shot, HEALING IMPLOSION"

*Light glowed in Twortz's wound, queuing it to start rapidly healing.*

Quintess: "You can't heal what isn't breathing!" *She sprinted towards Twortz and swayed her hand behind her, flicking the whip into the air.*

Twortz: *She frowned and slowly inhaled, holding her breath.* "Sonic Roar."

*Twortz screamed out a swirling shock wave at Quintess.*

Quintess: (Having two access points of attacking..) *She smirked and ran straight towards the shock wave, watching it swirl through her.*

Lezard: "It doesn't work!-"

Quintess: (By adding Astragons into a simple flashstep over the years-) *She jumped into striking distance and swayed her arm downwards, causing the whip to violently slash Twortz down the face.*

Twortz: "Tsk-" *She looked down, spitting out blood.*

Quintess: (I've managed to create and master what I call-)

Twortz: "Sonic Rush." *She swayed her frying pan through Quintess' face, watching the shock wave scatter behind her.*

Lezard: (Straight through her head!-)

Quintess: (The Astral Slip.) *She kicked Twortz in the stomach and listened to something crack.*

Twortz: *She held Quintess' foot with both hands and smiled.* "I got you."

Quintess: *She focused her attention back to Twortz, noticing her smirk.* "What warrants such a smile?"

Twortz: "I've got you now! Sonic Roar." *She screamed out a swirling shock wave in Quintess' face.*

Quintess: *Her leg suddenly slipped through Twortz's hands, allowing her to suddenly punch her in the face with the whip's handle.* "Fufufu."

Twortz: "How-?" *She stumbled back, holding her nose in pain.* "You attacked, so how can you still avoid my technique?!"

Quintess: "My ability isn't restricted to defence or offence, I'm able to do both-"

Synthoss: "My, sister." *She spoke with a smile and stood behind Lezard, holding the boy under one arm and Rachael by the hair on the ground.*

Lezard: (Razzypoo and.. Kid!..)

Twortz: *She looked at Synthoss, causing her to glance at Quintess.* (They're twins?)

Synthoss: *She glanced at Twortz, chuckling at her large size.* "Why is she still up? Fufufu."

Quintess: "Looking at this thing at a glance. You wouldn't expect her to be a Score User."

Twortz: (A Score User?)

Boy: *He looked up, staring at Twortz in confusion.* (If she's a Score User, why doesn't she ask this city for help? It'll respond to her-)

Synthoss: "Has she materialised her weapon?"

Quintess: "I'm not sure.. That cooking utensil doesn't utilise music well."

Lezard: (How foolish of me, she's a Score User!-)

Quintess: "And over there-" *She pointed her finger at Lezard without taking her eyes off Twortz.* "Uses the Radiatons."

Synthoss: "Wow, the Consultants will be pleased."

Quintess: "Maybe they'll send us on more missions together?"

Boy: (Speak up, Karol! Sp-Speak up!-) "I-If you're a Score User, you can disrupt any kind of Astragons based teckneek!-"

Quintess: "Silence him!"

Synthoss: *She casually raised her knee, kicking the boy in the face.* "Fufufu."

Lezard: (He's right.. The very few Score Users can obtain the ability to disrupt the Astragons in the air, even negating the ability to flashstep... But Twortz, she's too inexperienced-)

Twortz: (I have to try-) "Sonic Roar."

Synthoss: "Finish her off already."

Quintess: *She sprinted towards Twortz.* "AQUA LIQUID"

*Just as Twortz was about to scream out a shock wave, a wave of water suddenly slapped her across the side, causing her to stagger to one side.*

Quintess: (Excellent-) *She ran into striking distance, firmly holding onto her blue coloured whip.*

Twortz: *She suddenly dropped on all fours, causing Quintess to trip over her body.* (I can't-)

Quintess: *She fell face-first onto the ground, causing Synthoss to chuckle.* "Why did you-?" *She looked over her shoulder, watching Twortz stare at the ground.* ".. Given up?"

Lezard: (She may not have Radiatons, but people who use Remenistal through scores or dances can tap into Radiaton based Remenistal...)

Twortz: *She watched the water drip onto the courtyard's cemented floor with a sad-filled face.* (Should I just give up? Will I ever wake up or get back to Earth.. Why must I fight people I don't know?)

Quintess: "Fufufu." *She chuckled and slowly stood back up, snapping the blue whip by her side.* "I'll ensure it ends quickly."

Rachael: "T-Twortz! You're never a quitter! You taught me that!" *She shouted with one eye opened, causing Synthoss to gasp in disbelief.*

Synthoss: "When-?! How are you awake?!"

Rachael: "Twortz! Remember what happened to the only casualty!"

Twortz: (Never give up? Casualty?) *Rachael's words echoed in her mind, triggering a flashback.*

----------

*Twortz worked with several young teenagers on the front counter, listening to the fry buzzers in the background.*

Twortz: *She held a large takeaway bag, watching a young girl serve behind the counter with a smile.* "You're doing fine-"

Cashier: *She sighed with a stutter, slowly shaking her head.* "I can't-"

Twortz: "I mean it-"

Cashier: *She slowly nodded her head, taking a slow deep breath.* "OK, I can..."

Twortz: (She's been doing great.. But today she's been a little off.. She's due for a promotion because she hasn't given up. She just needs to learn front counter and she'll be set-)

Cashier: "Welcome to Fast Food Enterprise, how can I help you?"

Customer: "Yeah, by taking my order?" *He smirked, causing his young friend to snicker.*

Cashier: "A-Ah, how can I take your order?"

Customer: "Nicely?"

Cashier: "Ah..?" *She suddenly trembled, as if she was overwhelmed with emotion.*

Twortz: "Excuse me! Is there a problem here?" *She spoke in a stern professional-like manner.*

Customer: "Na, we're just trying to order, but this dumb bimbo won't help-"

Cashier: "I can't-" *She suddenly walked away from the counter, trying to hold back her tears.*

Twortz: "Ahem." *She walked up to the register, as if she was going to take the order instead.*

Customer: "That's better, can I get a classic meal?"

Twortz: "No.."

Customer: "What-?"

Twortz: "Get out." *She smiled and casually stepped to the side, quickly walking after the cashier.* "Where are you going?"

Cashier: "I'm leaving. I can't do this anymore. I tried my best for so long-"

Twortz: "Excuse me?"

Cashier: "I keep getting abused at home, I have no friends in this town!-, nobody likes a new person!"

Twortz: "Don't be ridiculous! You're amazing! And I can always find you a place to stay-"

Cashier: "I give up-" *She started to cry and ran out of the store, causing Twortz to quickly waddle out after her.*

Twortz: "Please, think about this-"

Cashier: "Thank you for everything you've-"

*A car turned around the corner, suddenly hitting the cashier onto the pavement.*

Twortz: "No!-"

Driver: *He quickly stepped out of the car.* "What was she doing running across a blind spot like that?!"

----------

Twortz: (She died on the spot... She wouldn't have, if she didn't quit!-) *She grunted in thought, as she intensely stared at the ground with widening eyes.*

Quintess: *She raised the whip, readying to attack the back of Twortz's head.* (I will slice her head off-)

Twortz: "I am no quitter! She shouted with an echoing voice."

Quintess: "Looks like you already have-"

Twortz: *She quickly grabbed the frying pan and swayed it behind her.* "Sonic Rush."

Quintess: "Really-" *She spoke with a calm voice, watching a scattered shock wave blow through her.*

Twortz: "I am no quitter!" *She slowly stood up.*

Quintess: "I will slip right through all your attacks and-"

Twortz: "Sphere of Might." *She jumped on the spot and a visible sphere-like shock wave expanded from her feet, blasting Quintess back.*

Synthoss: "What?" *She whispered on her breath in shock.*

Quintess: "How-?" *She slid on her feet and came to a stop.*

Lezard: (Her Sonic Rush and Sphere of Might must use different Astral frequencies?)

Quintess: "I've been relying on my ability too much in this fight.." *She smirked and snapped the whip, causing Lezard to wail in fear.* "Now I will take you down with brute force."

Twortz: *She faced Quintess and raised the frying pan, standing in a battle-ready pose.* "I'll show you the fruition of hard work."

Rachael: *She ran up to Twortz and stared at Quintess, raising her fists.* "I'm slightly the opposite, work hard, play harder!"

Twortz: *She glanced by her side, silently staring at Rachael.* "..."

Quintess: "Synthoss, letting your captured prisoners run free like that?"

Synthoss: "I don't understand, I drained all her Neurons?"

Quintess: "You must have miss judged, she would almost be dead."

Synthoss: "Exactly."

Twortz: (Almost be dead?)

Rachael: "I certainly don't feel it!-" *She raised her foot and kicked the ground, causing two dagger shaped rocks to burst out of the ground.*

Lezard: (A new Remenistal?)

Rachael: "Piercing Land." *She watched the two rocks spiral in mid-air, allowing her to catch them before they descended.*

Synthoss: "She may not look it, but her ground-based attacks have a lot of force behind them."

Quintess: (I'll slip through her ground-based attacks and dodge the sound altering attacks, waiting for a chance to kill them in one hit-)

Rachael: *She sprinted towards Quintess and stepped into striking distance, raising a dagger.* "Herh-"

*Rachael punched across Quintess' face, attempting to slice the dagger past her.*

Quintess: *She watched Rachael's rock made dagger slice through her head.* "Missed-"

Twortz: "Sonic Rush." *She swayed her frying pan down, waving a scattered shock wave towards Quintess.*

Quintess: *She quickly backflipped to the side, avoiding the shock wave's range.* "Fufufu-"

Rachael: "Rock Pillar." *She waved her arm up, causing a rock pillar to erupt behind Quintess.*

Twortz: *She smirked and inhaled deeply, holding her breath.* "Sonic Roar." *She screamed out a swirling shock wave directly towards Quintess.*

Quintess: "Fufu-" *She suddenly slipped backwards, stepping through the pillar behind her.*

Twortz: (Just as I hoped-)

Quintess: "No matter how much you try-"

*The shock wave hit the rock pillar, exploding shards of rock into Quintess' face.*

Quintess: "Argh?!"

Synthoss: "Sister?"

Rachael: *She ran into striking distance and kicked Quintess in the stomach.* "Hah!" *She spun around, slicing across Quintess' face.*

Quintess: "You dirty lamp!" *She swayed back and flicked the whip upwards, slapping it under Rachael's chin.*

Lezard: "Razzypoo!"

Twortz: *She waddled towards Quintess and lined herself up, holding a deep breath.* "Sonic Roar."

Rachael: *She held her chin in pain, watching a swirling shock wave slip right through Quintess.* (Twortz and I unintentionally work really well together.. It must've been all those busy times at Fast Food Enterprise-)

*Rachael tensed her arm and swayed it up, blasting a rock pillar up from the ground.*

Quintess: *She gasped, as the rock pillar smashed into the side of her shoulder.* "Tssk-"

Synthoss: (I can't risk letting this boy go.. I can't help you, sister.)

Lezard: "Quick healing shot, HEALING IMPLOSION"

*Light glowed under Rachael's chin and queued it to start rapidly healing, causing it to stop its bleeding.*

Rachael: "Thanks, Lezard!-"

Quintess: "AQUA LIQUID" *She shouted with an echoing voice and swayed her arm across Twortz.*

Twortz: *She had a flashback of the water.* "Sphere of Might."

*Twortz hopped on the spot and a visible sphere-like shock wave expanded from her feet, violently splashing the materialising water back.*

Rachael: *She shook her head and jumped towards Quintess, raising her arm.* "Take this-"

Quintess: *She swayed to the side and flicked the whip, smacking the two daggers out from Rachael's hands.* "Fufufu-"

Rachael: *She leant forward, quickly jabbing a fist towards Quintess' face.* "Hah!-"

Quintess: *She grabbed Rachael's fist and spun around, throwing her to the side.* "Double Smack."

Rachael: *She turned around to face Quintess.* "Rock Pill-"

*Quintess slightly tilted her wrists, causing the end of the whip to slap Rachael twice in a slithering-like manner.*

Rachael: (Ouch-) *She stumbled back, touching her cheeks.*

Quintess: (They fight well together..) *She snapped her blue whip back to her side, glancing at Rachael and Twortz.*

Lezard: "Quick healing shot, HEALING IMPLOSION"

*Light glowed in the fresh cuts on Rachael's face, queuing it to start rapidly healing.*

Quintess: (The Radiaton User keeps healing her!)

Rachael: "Piercing Land." *She kicked the ground, causing two dagger shaped rocks to erupt into the air.*

Quintess: *She looked to the side, watching Twortz line herself up.* (Now that he's here-) *She smirked to herself and looked back in front, noticing Rachael holding the dagger shaped rocks in determination.*

Rachael: "Retreat now, and no more harm will come to you."

Twortz: "Retreat? We must kill the seeds now, before they blossom into a threat later on-"

Rachael: "Unacceptable!"

Twortz: "..."

Quintess: "The fat one has a good mind frame.. You could've been an excellent warrior-"

?????: "What's happening here?"

Lezard: "A very large man with short brown hair with a very obvious double chin flashstepped behind Razzypoo. And he's wearing the same tight red and black leather clothes.. Yucky..."

Synthoss: "Tyson."

Rachael: (There's another one-) *She observed Tyson and ignored the rolls of fat around his stretched out leather, noticing a green whip hanging off his thigh.*

Tyson: *He smirked and cupped his hands, causing a spiralling green glyph to materialise in front of him.* "FLURRY STYX" *He pushed forward, blasting a condensed ball of wind at Rachael.*

Rachael: "Ah-?" *The ball of wind hit her, suddenly expanding into a swirl of air.*

Lezard: (Fast-) *He watched the air and Rachael move in slow motion.*

*The wind suddenly pulsed and blasted Rachael across the ground, causing her to squeal in pain.*

Twortz: "Sonic Rush." *She swayed the frying pan towards Tyson, blowing a scattered shock wave towards him.*

Tyson: *He waited for the shock wave and flared his nose in concentration, causing the scattered shock wave to swirl around him.* "..."

Lezard: (The shock wave moved itself around him?! It would've been a direct hit-)

Tyson: *He nudged his head forward, blasting the shock wave back towards Twortz.* "..."

Twortz: "Impossible!-" *She spoke on her breath and attempted to waddle out of the way, before being blasted onto her back by her own shock wave.*

Tyson: "Quintess, drain their Neurons and we'll be on our way."

Quintess: "Yeah." *She snapped her whip and her body glowed a shade of blue, causing an orange aura to swirl around the whip.* "Neuronic-"

?????: "Oh, goodness gracious me." *A man sarcastically spoke in the background, catching Quintess, Synthoss and Tyson's attention.*

Synthoss: "Who is it now?" *She spoke under her breath, glaring at a man concealed in brown robes with a cone-shaped hat.*

?????: "Are you Black Brigade culprits hurting my little monsters?"

Tyson: "How do you know about The Black Brigade?"

?????: "Unless there has been a death, there should be Blake, Tara, Quintess, Synthoss, Tyson and Zazark. Where are the other little sausages? I was planning on taking you all out in one go."

Lezard: "Father monster!"

?????: "Bahaha, my little monster."

Tyson: "You know far too much than you should-"

?????: "Well, what should we do about that?" *He giggled and shook his bottom sarcastic-like, causing Twortz to frown in disgust.*

Twortz: (He acts just like Lezard, but with an older sounding voice.)

Tyson: "Show your face."

?????: "Only if you remove all of your sealing glyphs."

Tyson: *He discreetly glanced at a black tattoo-like glyph on his wrist, causing him to frown.* "How do you know about those glyphs?"

?????: "Glyphs that hide your presence at the cost and reducing your power by almost half."

Rachael: *She slowly leant up, placing one hand on the ground for support.* (Who is that?)

Quintess: "Enough talk!" *She suddenly flashstepped directly in front of the man, blowing his robes to one side.* "Die!-"

?????: "FIRE'S PULSE" *He casually pointed in Quintess' face and a pulse of bright red flames blasted her across the courtyard.*

Quintess: (Hot-) *She closed her eyes in defeat, smashing into a distant pillar.*

?????: "Oooo, that was fun-"

Tyson: *He suddenly appeared behind the man with his green whip extended into the air.* "Tangrowth-"

?????: *He casually kicked behind him, causing a scorching vortex of bright red flames to blast Tyson back.* "Don't mind me, just stretching, bahaha."

Tyson: *He rolled out of the vortex of flames and tumbled across the ground, causing swirls of fire to scorch the air around him.* (I've never felt such powerful Neuron filled flames before-)

Synthoss: "Tssk-" *She carelessly dropped the boy onto the ground and started to sprint towards the man, queuing her eyes to crack like glass.*

?????: "Your eyes?" *He looked at Synthoss, facing her in a curious-like manner.* "That's a royal bloodline ability, isn't it?"

Synthoss: "AYON RAPTURE-"

?????: "FIRE'S PULSE" *He watched a ring of flames swirl around his finger before an enormous ring of flames spiralled in front of Synthoss.*

Synthoss: "Rosti-?!" *The ring of fire exploded, violently pushing her across the ground.*

?????: *He watched Synthoss stay on her feet in astonishment.* "You stay on your feet? Amazing.."

Synthoss: *She coughed and wheezed, buckling at the knees.* "What are you?"

?????: "Naw, you make these old bones feel all disgusting. What am I? I'm a human, you silly sausage."

Tyson: *He suddenly appeared behind the man, taking deep breaths.* "Ougi." *He reached out, watching the flesh on his arm melt away.*

Lezard: "Father monster!-"

Tyson: *He smirked and moved his fingers bones, as he was ready to grab the man's shoulder.* "Reaper's Leech."

?????: "FLAMING WHEEL" *He giggled with an echoing voice and a swirl of flames spiralled around him, before suddenly erupting into a bright red fire-like tornado.*

*Rachael and Twortz squinted their eyes in shock, as winds blew splinters of flames past their heads.*

Tyson: *He stared at the wall of fire swirl around his arm with a dropping jaw.* "What-?"

Rachael: (The air is hot!)

Twortz: (That man swirled the flames around himself, protecting himself from Tyson's bone arm.) *She thought to herself in confusion.*

Synthoss: "Those flames.. I've only ever seen one other person with flames as strong as that!-"

Quintess: *She pushed charcoaled debris off her body, causing it to crack the ground beside her.* "The Consultant."

?????: *He watched the fire tornado die down, allowing him to observe the Black Brigade members through the cracks of the swirling flames.* "Hmm? These old bones are just getting warmed up."

Tyson: *He stumbled back and watched his bones crumble to ash.* "My Ougi?" *He spoke on his breath, as his arm reverted back to normal.*

?????: "Shame, looks like you can't use that devastating Ougi no more-"

Quintess: "Retreat!"

Synthoss: "What about the boy-?!"

Quintess: "Now!" *She screamed in desperation before suddenly flashstepping out of sight, leaving behind a faint buzzing sound.*

?????: "Oh, I know old people aren't welcomed to parties, but there's no need to leave right away-"

Synthoss: "I'm not leaving behind the sole reason why we were here!-"

Tyson: "Synthoss, The Unknown Territories, we might be better off helping any captain out." *He implied it would be better to leave without injury.*

?????: (The Unknown Territories?!)

Synthoss: "Fine... Only because of the recent talk about it lately-"

?????: (Recent talk about The Unknown Territories?)

*Tyson and Synthoss gritted their teeth and hesitantly looked away, before flashstepping out of the courtyard.*

Lezard: "Yay." *He clapped his hands and giggled.* "Dad!"

?????: "Are you okay, my little monster?"

Lezard: "I am now."

Twortz: (H-He just took care of those three with such ease..) *She stuttered in thought, trying to keep her eyes off the man.*

Rachael: "Who are you?"

?????: "Ooo, Lezard, the ladies look delicious."

Twortz: "Excuse me?"

?????: "You're excused."

Lezard: "Even that one? She'd be more succulent than delicious."

?????: "Even the plumpest chicken could be the most yummiest in my opinion."

Lezard: "Bwarharharh."

?????: "Bahahaha."

Twortz: "I'm right here-"

?????: "And she's very observant too."

Twortz: "..."

Lezard: *He stood up, focusing his attention onto Rachael.* "Quick healing shot, HEALING IMPLOSION"

Rachael: *She watched her wounds light up, causing her to slowly relax in relief.* "By the way Lezard talks to you, I'm safe to say you're a friend?"

Lezard: *He focused on Twortz.* "Quick healing shot, HEALING IMPLOSION"

?????: "Indeedly-dee I am. My name is Millard."

Rachael: "My name is Rachael."

Lezard: "Quick internal light, INVOKING AURA" *He continued to focus on Twortz, watching spirals of light swirl around her chest area.*

Twortz: *She stood up and placed her hands behind her back, standing in a professional manner.* "My name is Twortz. I much appreciate your efforts."

Millard: "Such a sense of loyalty, I like it." *He giggled and wiggled his bottom.*

Lezard: *He noticed Rachael holding her shoulder in pain.* "Quick internal light, INVOKING AURA"

Twortz: "What are you doing here?"

Millard: "I was searching for my partner.." *He quickly spun around, scanning the courtyard.* "By these ruins, it seems I was a few days too late."

Lezard: (So, even dad missed her again..)

Twortz: "How are you so powerful?"

Millard: "Perhaps my age?"

Twortz: "In your late forties?"

Millard: "Bahaha, stop flattering me! I can't even remember, a few hundred years ago?"

Twortz and Rachael: "A few hundred years?!"

Lezard: "Remember, Astragons can slow down the aging process? I'm easily over a hundred myself, children."

Millard: "Said the child."

Lezard: "Holy fish-cakes, I'm no longer the oldest of this party-"

Millard: "Naww-" *He lowered his head and pretended to sulk.*

Lezard: "Fear not, daddypoo! You're always amazing in my eyes, no matter how old those bones of yours get!"

Millard: "Yay!" *He suddenly smiled, making his previous sulking even more of an act.*

Rachael: "Lezard, could you please check on that boy?"

Lezard: "Why yes?" *He turned around, noticing the boy lying unconscious on the ground.*

Millard: *His stomach rumbled, causing him to rub his belly.* "Yum yums?"

Lezard: *He shook his head.* "None of us have an RPG bag."

Millard: "Blast the Astragons." *He whined and took a step forward, adjusting his cone-shaped hat.*

Lezard: "Where did your one go?"

Millard: "I thought you had it."

Lezard: "INVOKING AURA" *He spread his arms over the boy and focused.*

Millard: "Ooo, these old bones wail with despair. We lost our delicious bag-"

Boy: *White light spiralled around his head, causing him to squeak into consciousness.* "W-Where-?!"

Millard: "Shh, my little snapper."

Boy: "S-Snapper?"

Rachael: *She faced the boy, smiling in appreciation.* "Even though we lost, thanks for helping me out back there."

Boy: *He whined in discomfort, looking at Rachael.* (The one who uses fake Remenistal?)

Rachael: "So, maybe you could explain some stuff to us, Millard."

Millard: "I'm always up for story time."

Twortz: "Excellent, we're from a place called-"

Millard: "But no story time is worth telling on an empty stomach."

Lezard: "Yay, good minds think alike."

Twortz: "Oh bother-"

Lezard: "Surely you can relate to our current frame of mind, Twortz?"

Twortz: "I don't always think about food!" *She hissed in anger, causing Lezard to raise his arms in a defensive-like manner.*

Millard: "Leave her alone, Lezardestel." *He spoke in a serious-like manner, causing Lezard to suddenly act mature.*

Lezard: "Sorry."

Millard: "Now-" *He walked up to the boy and bent down, smiling in a friendly-like manner.* "How do we go about getting something to eat? You see, old grubs like us work better on a full stomach."

Boy: "I erm..." *He nervously looked away.* "There isn't any-"

Twortz: "He was holding a loaf of bread."

Lezard: "Ooo, please tell. I'm starving I could eat three fire based Scoldrants."

Millard: "Wowza, glad I'm not Scoldrant."

Rachael: (Their humour bounces back on each other.) *She slightly smiled in thought.*

Millard: "My name is Millardestel-"

Boy: "Myll-estel? Th-That means you're a Konsultant!" *He suddenly squealed in fear and awkwardly slid on his bottom away from Millard.*

Millard: "It's okay, little youngster. I'm a good guy."

Lezard: *He nodded his head and focused his attention on the boy's grazes.* "Quick healing shot, HEALING IMPLOSION"

Boy: *He watched his grazes fill with light, causing him to stop panicking.* "It's warm.."

Lezard: "Radiatons are warm." *He giggled and smiled.*

Boy: "My name is Karol."

Twortz: "What exactly is a Consultant?"

Millard: "They're the leaders of the warriors."

Twortz: "So, why didn't you command your warriors to stop?"

Millard: "I'm no longer part of that."

Lezard: "My mother.. We're trying to find her."

Millard: "She's also a Consultant."

Rachael: "..."

Karol: "Sh-She's bad."

Millard: "No, silly. She's merely under the influence of that yellow-eyed disease."

Lezard: (If she didn't transfer her powers onto me...) *He looked sad, catching Millard's attention.*

Millard: *He hobbled up to Lezard and placed his hand on his shoulder.* "Out of everything in the world, we value you, our son more than anything.. Don't ever question that." *He mumbled so only Lezard could hear.*

Lezard: "Thanks, dad."

Millard: "Now, things are too serious." *He clapped his hands and spun around, glancing at the party.* "The Consultants aren't here, we're all hungry, Karol! Lead the way!"

Karol: *He nodded his head and slowly stood up.* "Okay."

Rachael: "When I chased after you, how did you activate all those paths and stuff?"

Twortz: "What do you mean?"

Rachael: "Well, before I had to use my Rostical, I quickly scanned the area and couldn't find any switches or buttons."

Karol: "This city is filled with ancient Astragons."

Lezard: "From Valhalla."

Karol: "Yep." *He started to slowly walk towards a large castle-like ruins, causing the party to follow.*

Twortz: "..." *She silently followed Karol.*

Rachael: "What does that mean?"

Karol: "This city responds to dancing or singing."

Twortz: "How utterly ridiculous! If I were to start singing-, lalalalala-"

*The ground around Twortz responded to her voice, causing a large glyph to shake.*

Karol: "S-Stahp! You'll activate the city's defences!"

Twortz: "Ckee-" *She quickly covered her mouth in shock, watching the ground revert back to normal.*

Rachael: "Lalalala." *She sung on a high note, noticing nothing happened.*

Lezard: "Dun-, dun, duuuun. You failed."

Karol: "W-Why did yooh do that?!"

Rachael: "Sorry, Karol. I was curious."

Twortz: "Although that was very irresponsible, why did nothing happen?"

Karol: "She isn't a Score User like yourself."

Millard: "Ooo, sing us a heart warming song."

Twortz: "I don't know how to."

Rachael: "You know how to sing, Twortz."

Twortz: "Tsst-"

Millard: "You seem confused, child?"

Twortz: "I am far from a child, thank you."

Lezard: "She's right. She's very boring."

Millard: "Bahahah, okay." *He smiled and continued to follow Karol.*

Rachael: "You learnt a few new techniques, Twortz."

Twortz: "They are quite similar in my opinion."

Karol: "Maybe, but each have their own harhmonick freakency."

Twortz: "Different harmonic frequency? Explain."

Lezard: "Like how you disrupted that crazy lady's slippy ability."

Twortz: "How is it, a child knows more about my abilities than me?"

Lezard and Millard: "Quite easy-"

Millard and Lezard: "Personal jinx!-"

Lezard: "Bwarharh-"

Twortz: "Ahem?"

Millard: "Well-" *He scratched his head and sarcastically laughed.* "I'm not too sure."

Lezard: "Me neither."

Karol: "You seem to be a natural at the scores."

Millard: "So, what kind of weapon have you materialised?"

Twortz: "What does that mean?"

Rachael: *She nodded her head in agreement.* "Those people in leather mentioned something similar too."

Millard: "Score Users, Dancers and Astraseekers have the ability to solidify their own spirit into a specialised weapon."

Rachael: "Astraseekers?"

Twortz: "Every question answered seems to leave more questions." *She sighed to herself.*

Millard: "With most Score Users I've encountered, a musical weapon seems to be the best weapon to materialise."

Karol: "This is a won time only prowcess."

Twortz: (A one time only process.) *She repeated the facts in her mind, trying to keep up with the conversation.*

Karol: "There are several Score-... There were several Score Users here-" *He stopped at the ruin and started to dance, causing the pillars to glow.*

Twortz: "Did I create this frying pan?" *She spoke to herself and moved her arms in front, observing the many scratches on the frying pan.*

Millard: "I could see if you want?" *He stared in front, watching glyphic ruins draw themselves around Karol.*

Twortz: "I was talking to myself out loud. It's rude to eavesdrop."

Millard: "Ouchies, these old bones apologise."

Twortz: "..." *She lowered her arms and placed them behind her back.*

Rachael: "Wow, so, could anyone do this?" *She smiled at all the glyphs responding to Karol's movement.*

Lezard: "It was similar when our dear friend sung.. It only responds to certain users."

Rachael: "Could I become a Score User or a dancer?"

Lezard: "I'm afraid not."

Rachael: "Why?" *She spoke with disappointment.*

Lezard: "It's like affinities. You can't change what you are."

Rachael: "So, if I'm a Rostical User, I can't be a healer?"

Millard: "Not without Radiatons."

Karol: *He watched a portal open up, revealing an image of a warehouse-like environment.* "I-It's open."

Millard: "Excellent work, young snapper."

Rachael: (Young snapper? He says such stupid stuff, but at the same time, he says it with such confidence.)

Twortz: "W-What am I looking at?"

Lezard: "A Spacial Funnel?"

Karol: "Yep." *He awkwardly smiled and skipped inside the warped portal-like entrance.*

Millard: "Let's go, everyone!"

Lezard: *He giggled and started to hobble towards the portal.* "And our friends follow the youngster into the shadowy abyss."

Millard: "More like our heroes."

Lezard: "Ooo, heroes? I like it!"

Twortz: *She watched Millard, Lezard and Karol's body warp inside the Spacial Funnel.*

Rachael: "Let's go, Twortz." *She spoke to herself and stepped through the warped air.*

Twortz: "Once they're full, we'll finally get some answers." *She hissed to herself and stepped forward, watching the area warp and swirl around her.*

Karol: "This is a Spacial Funnel-"

Rachael: "Kah-" *She suddenly collapsed inside the warehouse-like area, catching the party's attention.*

Lezard: "Holy fish-cakes, what's wrong, Razzypoo?"

Rachael: "I don't feel-" *She shook her head and stared at the ground.* "So good-"

Millard: "Hmm?" *He spoke in a serious-like manner, observing Rachael's body expressions.*

Twortz: *She stepped forward and instantly noticed Rachael on the ground.* "What's wrong?"

Rachael: "I-..."

Karol: (I've only seen a certain race of people get ill after entering the Spacial Funnels..)

Lezard: "Are you feeling well, Twortz? Since you come from the same place."

Twortz: "Indeed I am." *She spoke in confusion.*

Rachael: "I... It's hot? I don't feel well.."

Millard: "Maybe stuffing your face in will help?" *He rubbed his stomach and giggled like a child.*

Lezard: "Perhaps!" *He quickly faced Karol.* "Kiddo!-"

Karol: "Y-Yhes?" *He spoke nervously, avoiding eye contact.*

Lezard: "Lead me to the yummiest of all yummies for my empty tummy-rummy!" *He giggled, shaking his bottom in a sarcastic-like manner.*

Twortz: *She looked at Millard, pointing at Lezard.* "So, if you're apparently a hundred something years old, why do you act like that?"

Millard: "Act?" *He watched Lezard and Karol walk away, causing him to focus on Rachael.* "Like fun?"

Twortz: "Please." *She spoke in a mature-like manner, looking away.*

Millard: *He giggled and hobbled up to Rachael, helping her onto her feet.* "Some assistance please, Twortzamotto?"

Twortz: "Twortzamotto? What kind of ridiculous name is that?"

Millard: "A fun one, bahahaha." *He chuckled and hid his struggle, as he tried to keep Rachael on her feet by himself.*

----------

Lezard: "Lezard and the delicious little hero walked down this poorly lit storage room, observing many different items along many shelves."

Karol: "Aren't you Lezard?"

Lezard: "Indeed, my little hero."

Karol: "But you spoke to yourself in... Anotha persp.. Persp-, perspecktive."

Lezard: "Bwarharh, that's just me."

Karol: "Uhm, so are you a winged being too?"

Lezard: "My, my.. You know about Valhalla?"

Karol: "Yhes!"

Lezard: "He spoke with such enthusiasm."

Karol: "Who-?" *He looked to each side, as if he wasn't expecting anyone else to be in the area.*

Lezard: "You seem innocent enough."

Karol: "Enosent?"

Lezard: "I obtained my Radiatons from my mum."

Karol: "Where is she now?"

Lezard: "That's what I was hoping to find out." *He paused and looked serious.* "I'm sorry for what she did to your city."

Karol: "Was she the sckary lady with glasses?"

Lezard: "I'm not sure, but she does wear glasses."

Karol: "She's a bad person."

Lezard: "No. She isn't. She's a very heart-warming person, always willing to put others before herself."

Karol: "Then, what happened?"

Lezard: "She gave away her Radiatons and by doing this, allowed her to be consumed by that yellow-eyed disease."

Karol: "..."

Lezard: "I understand if you're too young to get what I'm saying."

Karol: "Here-" *He stopped and waved his hand across a newer looking shelving, revealing stacks of food.*

Lezard: "Wowza, what's all this?"

Karol: "Emerhgencies."

Lezard: "Fantastic. We'll grab enough for five people." *He giggled and twiddled his fingers, as if he was excited to pick out which foods to get.*

Karol: "The bread makes you fool."

Lezard: "I like to get full too. Maybe some sandwiches?"

----------

Millard: "How intriguing, why is it only Rachael who gets sick?"

Twortz: "How would I know. You're the person that's meant to give us the answers we need."

Millard: "I see."

Twortz: *She paused and hesitantly mumbled to herself, as if she wanted to say something.* "Before.. You mentioned something about a weapon."

Millard: "Yes?"

Twortz: "Could you help me?"

Millard: "Sorry?" *He placed his hand next to his ear, implying her wanted to hear something.*

Twortz: "Please?"

Millard: "Of course!"

Rachael: "Err..." *She slowly fell unconscious, causing Millard and Twortz to slowly place her on the floor.*

Twortz: "Will she be okay?"

Millard: "Yes."

Twortz: (She's heavier than she looks-) "Are you certain?"

Millard: "You're a Score User, that doesn't even know how to materialise your power.. And she's apparently a Rostical User?"

Twortz: "From what we've been told, yes."

Millard: "A Rostical User.. She'll be fine." *He stood up and placed his hands out in front, as if he wanted to hold something.*

Twortz: "What-?"

Millard: "Give me your hands, child."

Twortz: *She stood up straight and waddled closer to Millard, slowly placing the back of her hands in his.* "Like this-?"

Millard: "Bam!"

Twortz: "Hiyuck!?" *She hiccuped in shock, causing Millard to giggle.*

Millard: "Sorry, sorry. I just wanted to try something."

Twortz: "Try what?"

Millard: "It doesn't matter. Do you know the legends about what the winged beings are?"

Twortz: "No?"

Millard: (I see.)

Twortz: "Have they got something to do with my weapon?"

Millard: "No."

Twortz: "So, why did you-?"

Millard: "I don't like blowing my own trumpet, but you're lucky you get me of all people to teach you something."

Twortz: "Okay." *Her arms started to shake, as if she was nervous.*

Millard: "Get that cooking utensil."

Twortz: "Why?"

Millard: "In order to manifest your being, you'll need to get a hold of your Astragons."

Twortz: "But I do?"

Millard: "Oh? You already do?"

Twortz: "Yes."

Millard: "Okay." *He lowered his arms and stepped back, readying himself.*

Twortz: "What are you doing?"

Millard: "If you've got Astragon control, then, manipulate my flame."

Twortz: "What flame-?"

Millard: *A lighter-like flame flickered on the ground, lighting up their feet.* "This one."

Twortz: (Amazing. Despite what I've already seen, this still holds such shock value.)

Millard: "I've noticed there's a lot of flammable items in here. I'd hate to see something burst-"

Twortz: "But it's stationary-" *She watched the flame move along the ground towards a shelving full of pots.* "What?! It's moving-?!"

Millard: "Oh dear! Watch out!-"

Twortz: "Ah-Ah?! Focus!" *She shouted at herself and concentrated on the flame, causing it to suddenly brighten and become larger.* "What?!"

Millard: "No, you've added Neurons and powered up the flames!"

Twortz: "How is this possible?"

Millard: "You're giving the flames power!" *He watched the area light up due to the growing flames.*

Twortz: "How do I manipulate it with my Astragons?! I'm thinking about controlling it!"

Millard: "Your sudden attention is fuelling it with your Neurons!"

Twortz: "I-I don't understand!" *She spoke in fear, as if she didn't know what to do.*

Millard: "You're using Neurons, not Astragons!"

Twortz: (So that's what Neurons feel like.)

Millard: "It's getting close to the flammables!"

Twortz: "What do I feel?"

Millard: "It's not something I can explain. But if I had to word it, it'll be.. Motion around it with your hands, as if you're trying to keep a pile of wet sand stable."

Twortz: "Wet sand?" *Images of a shore flashed in her mind.* "Okay-"

*Twortz bent her knees and started to wave her hands around the flames, unintentionally sticking her tongue out.*

Millard: (Her posture looks hilarious-) *The flame's flickering light drew his attention towards it.* (She's already grasping the control so easily? Either, she's born to be very powerful, or she's lying and she's just playing dumb to learn some skills from me-)

Twortz: "It's hard to-" *She frowned with a twitching eye, watching the light spiral out of control.* "Ah!-"

Millard: "Oh my! Focus harder!"

Twortz: "I don't know how to!"

Millard: "Try to imagine moulding the wet sand into a ball."

Twortz: *She bent her knees more, allowing her to focus harder.* "It's harder."

Millard: "Good flaming gravy! You can do it!" *He jumped up into the air, giggling to boost her morale.*

Twortz: "Wow-" *She lowered her arms in shock, causing the flames to touch the first barrel.*

Millard: "What-?! Why did you give up?!" *He swayed his arm, causing the fire to instantly puff away, as if a strong gust of wind blew it.*

Twortz: (So he was in control of the situation-)

Millard: "Little monster, why did you give up?"

Twortz: *She shook her head in amazement.* "I-I felt-... No. It felt like I touched the flames." *She spoke with a dropping jaw.*

Millard: (She didn't give up, it was the feeling of touching the flames with her Astragons that put her off-) "Wow, your Astragon control must be amazing!"

Twortz: "I'd like to try again-"

Millard: *He shook his head and hobbled forward, purposely lifting up Twortz's frying pan.* "What is the most comfortable way to pull something off your possession?"

Twortz: "I don't understand?"

Millard: "Like a sword-" *He reached over his shoulder.* "Or a knife-" *He flicked forward from his waist.* "Or a whip-" *He placed his hand on his thigh.*

Twortz: "Well-?" *She felt around her body and slowly reached over her shoulder.* "Over my shoulder-"

Millard: "Okies. That's a common spot for captains to hold their weapons."

Twortz: "Excuse me?"

Millard: *He shook his head.* "Since you're really good at understanding your Astragons, we'll get straight to it. With that same feeling you had when controlling the flames-"

Twortz: "The sand?"

Millard: "Yes. Imagine trying to contain air."

Twortz: "Contain air?" *She sounded unconvinced.*

Millard: "Like, a pocket? Or a pouch?" *He hopped on the spot, pretending to be a kangaroo.*

Twortz: "Okay.." *She nodded her head and focused.*

Millard: "Now, slowly place the frying pan over your shoulder, and picture it fading or getting sucked into the pocket."

Twortz: "That sounds way too confusing, even for me."

Millard: "Don't you want to try?"

Twortz: "Well-" *She raised the frying pan and slowly placed it over her shoulder, causing her to accidentally hit her shoulder blade.*

Millard: "When you've felt the pocket-" *He motioned a small pocket around his thigh and pretended to pull out a weapon.* "When you're reaching into and pulling out, you want to feel a resistance, similar to a magnetic pull."

Twortz: *She slowly moved the frying pan up and down, as if she was scratching her back.* (I do feel a little resistance, but it goes away when I push the frying pan further down.)

Millard: (It has taken several captains months to learn this ability.. I wouldn't be surprised if-)

Twortz: "I think I got the feeling."

Millard: (Her growth is remarkable!-)

Twortz: "Millard?"

Millard: "When you feel that slight magnetic resistance, picture or imagine a suction feeling."

Twortz: (How can you picture a feeling? But okay.) *She closed her eyes with one arm over her shoulder, trying to conceal the frying pan.* "I think!-"

*The frying pan suddenly disappeared out of Twortz's hands, causing her to chuckle in disbelief.*

Twortz: "Hahahackee, I did it?!" *She opened her eyes, twiddling her fingers to ensure she wasn't still holding the frying pan.*

Millard: "Amazing!" *He placed his hands on each side of his face and wiggled his bottom, symbolising his excitement for Twortz's accomplishment.*

Twortz: *She lowered her arms and waddled around, seeing if she dropped it by accident.* "It's really gone?"

Millard: "Do you feel something on your back, but it's not heavy?"

Twortz: "I-I do?" *She looked down, as if she was trying to feel what was on her back.* "It's like a strap or something similar. It's not heavy, but I know it's there."

Millard: "Sensational! Now, pull it out in the same manner and, yay."

Twortz: "Yay?"

Millard: "You've somehow managed to complete a training lesson which could take weeks or even months in about ten minutes."

Twortz: *She smiled at herself in a modest-like manner.* "I do learn quickly. I became a store manager by only working for seven months."

Millard: "Delicious results!"

Twortz: *She eagerly reached over her shoulder and grabbed onto something.* "Okay-" *She pulled forward, causing sparks to scatter around her frying pan.*

Millard: "Succulent!"

Twortz: *She smiled and twirled the frying pan in her hand, before placing it back over her shoulder.* "Do I have to concentrate like that all the time?" *She felt the frying pan suction out of her grip, causing her to lower her arm with nothing in her hand.*

Millard: "Nope. It's like riding a bike. When you get used to the feeling, you don't have to concentrate balancing yourself anymore."

Twortz: "Ah."

Millard: "Now-" *He dropped to one knee and rubbed his fingers under Rachael's nose, causing smoke to trail into the air.*

Rachael: "Kah-?!" *She suddenly gasped into consciousness, looking to each side in disorientation.* "Is something on fire?"

Lezard: "I hope so. We could have toast!"

Millard: *He turned around, noticing Lezard and Karol each carrying an arm full of food.* "Yummy."

Rachael: "It's awfully dark in here." *She looked up and shook her head, slowly sitting on her legs.*

Karol: *He stopped in front of the party and bent down, gently dropping the food on the floor.* "Here-"

*Karol started to dance and a sigil-like glyph drew itself underneath him, causing bright glyphs to suddenly flicker above the party.*

Twortz: "The ceiling?" *She looked up, watching the glyphs stay on, brightly lighting up the warehouse.*

Rachael: "That's awesome. Thanks, Karol."

Karol: "Nee hee, that's okay."

Twortz: *Her stomach loudly grumbled, causing Lezard and Millard to laugh.* "What's so funny about normal human bodily functions?"

Millard: "Now, now, child. Let's all sit down and get some answers." *He plunked himself on the floor and reached for a loaf of bread, watching it toast in his hands.*

Rachael: *She sniffed several times.* "It actually smells like toast."

Millard: "Here." *He smiled, presenting the toast to Rachael.*

Rachael: "I'm actually not hungry-"

Lezard: "Not hungry? We've been through crazy stuff! Your body needs to recharge."

Karol: "Recharge?" *He sat on the floor with his legs crossed, glancing at Lezard in a curious-like manner.*

Millard: "Food is just fuel for the body."

Karol: "Oh-?"

Twortz: "I agree." *She spoke in a professional-like manner and elegantly reached over, grabbing a roll of bread.*

Millard: "Allow me to keep everyone up to date."

Rachael: *She awkwardly watched everyone eat.* (Lezard is right, I'm usually starving after a tense training workout, but I'm not hungry at all? Why is that?)

Millard: "Twortz is ready to materialise her weapon soon."

Twortz: "I am?"

Millard: "Rachael is an Elementalist."

Rachael: "I'm a what-?"

Karol: "Th-That maykes sense!" *He chewed with enthusiasm.*

Lezard: "Wow, an Elementalist!"

Millard: "And to top off the plot twists, Twortz and Rachael don't come from this world."

*Twortz and Rachael glanced at Millard in confusion and shock, before focusing their attention on to Lezard.*

Lezard: "Why you both looking at me?"

Twortz: "Why are you openly telling people that?"

Millard: "When exactly did he have an opportunity to do so, child?"

Twortz: "Err.."

Rachael: (He's right.. Twortz would have been with him the entire time.)

Karol: "What do you mean, from anuther werld?"

Millard: "I'd refrain from telling something so confusion to a juvenile, but as a member of the sacred dancers, you probably know more than most adults would."

Rachael: "What does that mean?"

Millard: "There are truths of the world that the warriors now mask. For example, Valhalla."

Twortz: "Why would the warriors keep things like that hidden?" *She covered her mouth as she spoke.*

Millard: "Power."

Rachael: "Power?"

Lezard: "Knowledge is power."

Karol: "Anuther werld. Like a diffurent continent?"

Millard: *He shook his head, as if it was too hard to explain.* "Just, don't be surprised if they don't know simple stuff, little one."

Karol: "Oh, ohkay?" *He glanced at Rachael, smiling in amazement.*

Rachael: "Is there something on my face?" *She became self-concious, touching her cheek in confusion.*

Karol: "No.. I've hardly seen an Elementalist in my life."

Twortz: (Hardly seen? What horrible grammar.. But I don't expect much from a child-)

Rachael: "Why? What happened to them?" *She smiled in confusion.*

Karol: "They were wiped out."

Rachael: "Oh.."

Lezard: "Awkward.." *He pulled an awkward face and looked away.*

Rachael: "If you don't mind me asking. What happened to them?"

Karol: "Somefing happened, and they all got that yellow sckary eyed sickness."

Rachael: (It all comes down to this yellow-eyed illness..)

Twortz: "If you know we're not from this world. How can we get back?"

Millard: "..." *He silently chewed in thought.*

Rachael: "Millard?"

Millard: "Was there aurora lights?"

Rachael: "Not to my knowledge."

Twortz: *She looked down and chewed, frowning in recollection.* "Sceldrant's Comet."

Rachael: *She gasped in acknowledgement.* "Yeah! That comet had a lot of aurora coloured lights. Even Mel was saying that the lights weren't normal."

Millard: (Madora..) "There is someone who could help you."

Rachael: "Excellent. We'll talk to her and get back home."

Millard: "It's not the simple.."

Twortz: "What's the problem?"

Millard: "She's untraceable."

Twortz: "This is nothing compared to Earth-" *She glanced at Rachael, implying it wasn't as easy as she made it.*

Rachael: "Yeah." (There are so many things I used to take for granted, like mobile phones, cars..) *She sighed to herself.*

Twortz: (Nothing like Earth? Hahackee, can't believe I just said that..) *She thought in disgust.* "How can we find this person?"

Millard: "Even if there was a chance you could find her, you'd need to go to Silver Wind Island or join the warriors."

Rachael: "No way we're joining the warriors."

Millard: "I don't blame you." *He spoke of relief, as if he didn't want them to.*

Twortz: "..."

Karol: "They're bad peeple."

Rachael: "I have a question we kinda skipped."

Millard: "Yes, little monster?"

Rachael: "What is different between an Elementalist and a Rostical User?"

Lezard: "Oh boy-" *He burped and lay on his back, staring at the bright glyphs on the ceiling.* "Wake me up in the morning please."

Twortz: "What is with the lax attitude?"

Lezard: "Father monster likes to explain things in detail.. I won't be surprised if you'll know more than me and the captain by tomorrow."

Karol: "Capt'n?"

Lezard: "Shhh, sleepy time." *He closed his eyes with a smile.*

Twortz: *She yawned, as she struggled to stay alert.* "I will listen to as much as I can, but I'm quite tired."

Karol: "..." (I feel comfortable with these people..)

Rachael: "This feels so odd.. We currently don't have a home."

Karol: *He discreetly stared at Rachael with a dropping jaw.* (She doesn't have a home?)

Millard: "My condolences, little monster."

Twortz: "If joining the warriors isn't an option, where is Silver Wind Island?"

Karol: "Isn't that citee all the way up at the other end on continent?"

Twortz: "I'm not giving up, but I'm very tired of these tedious hikes.. My legs hurt too much."

Rachael: (I'm a little exhausted, but I feel fine?)

Millard: "Don't worry. I have two teleportation glyphs remaining."

Twortz: "W-What are they?"

Millard: "A purple glyph that transfers you to other places." *He giggled and opened his hand, revealing two small grey stones with dark purple lines drawn on them.*

Twortz: "What will they do?"

Rachael: "Stones being able to teleport-" *She looked away from Millard's hand and lay on her back, closing her eyes.* "That seems a little extreme to me."

Millard: "Don't be fooled by their appearance. They've got a lot of Astragons stored in them."

Twortz: "And to activate them, you'll need Neurons?"

Millard: "That's exactly right."

Twortz: *She nodded her head in understanding.* (I've had the wrong mind frame this entire time. Instead of fighting against my current situation, I will try my best like I always do.)

Rachael: "I'd rather walk."

Twortz: (Speak for yourself-)

Millard: "Ooo, I like the adventure too."

Rachael: "That's not it. It's that sickly feeling I get after getting transported. It really isn't worth it in my opinion."

Millard: "That would be the Elementalist weakness."

Rachael: *She half opened her eyes, as if she was interested to hear what Millard had to say.* "Yeah?"

Millard: "It's not the teleportation, it's probably certain Spacial Funnels and Reality Marbles."

Rachael: "Oh?"

Twortz: "So Rostical Users don't get sick by going through these?"

Millard: "Unless you naturally get motion sickness, not really."

Twortz: "That is a huge disadvantage, isn't it?"

Rachael: "That explains why I got sick the first time. But it seems to get worse."

Millard: "You just need rest."

Rachael: "I'm not really tired, though-"

Millard: "Child, you can hardly keep your eyes open."

Rachael: "..."

Twortz: "Unless they're weaker than Rostical Users, what advantages do they have over Rostical Users?"

Millard: "Oooo-" *He wiggled his bottom in excitement.* "What a delicious question."

Twortz: "Well?"

Millard: "Have you heard what Purity Zones are?"

Twortz: "Purity Zones? Maybe, but I don't recall it though."

Millard: "Well-"

----------

*Quintess, Synthoss and Tyson flashstepped into an open plain, causing buzzing sounds to echo around them.*

Quintess: "Who-?" *She dropped the blue whip and fell to her knees.* "We failed?"

Synthoss: *She watched the leather clothes start to stitch themselves back together.* (Our garments absorb our own Astragons to help repair itself and to keep itself clean. One of the best inventions the Consultants have distributed to us-)

Tyson: "My hand-, my Ougi-" *He looked at his hand, staring at the skin in perfect condition.*

Quintess: "Can't you use your Ougi with both hands?" *She gave the impression he shouldn't be sulking over one arm.*

Tyson: ".. Yes.."

Synthoss: "We need to tell the Consultant about the fire based Rostical User immediately."

Quintess: "How dare they-"

Tyson: "I won't forgive them.. I spent most of my teenage years trying to perfect and master Astragons in my hands." *He spoke to himself in anger, triggering flashbacks of the flames burning his bones to ash.*

Synthoss: "Only because it was a large city of dancers, we probably won't be sent off together again."

Quintess: (It's true. It's not often three of us get issued the same mission-)

Tyson: "I'll be going after them."

Quintess: "Well-" *She stood up and smirked.*

Synthoss: "Quintess?"

Quintess: "We do finish off our missions rather quickly." *She implied something.*

Tyson: "I don't get it?"

Quintess: "Maybe we could hunt them one by one in our spare time?"

Synthoss: "Sister." *She spoke with an impressed smirk, as if she was interested in the proposal.*

Tyson: "I've never been a fan of extracurricular missions, but I guess I could start now." *He opened and closed his hands.*

Synthoss, Quintess and Tyson: "Fufufufu."

----------

Twortz: "Elementalists are weakened by passing through distorted Astragons such as Spacial Funnels and Reality Marbles, while Rostical Users are weakened in Purity Zones.."

Millard: "It's all very interesting, isn't it?"

Rachael: "Mmm." *She mumbled, implying she was still listening.*

Twortz: (If I had to choose, an Elementalist has a better advantage. You could choose not to enter a Spacial Funnel, while you'd have no choice but to pass through a Purity Zone.)

Millard: *He rubbed his hands near his self-contained camp-like fire and adjusted his cone-shaped hat.* "Tell me more about where you're from-?"

Rachael: "Zzzz.."

Millard: "Either, your world is really boring or she's asleep."

Twortz: "We don't have Rostical-"

Millard: *He suddenly hissed, causing Twortz to lean back in fright.* "Hssst! No Rostical?! That's upsetting-"

Twortz: "Sshh, you'll wake everyone up."

Lezard: "Healing Fart...." *He mumbled in his sleep.*

Karol: "Daddy, mumsy.."

Rachael: "Zzzz."

Millard: "Bahaha, excuse me. At times, these old bones don't know when to stop."

Twortz: "Interesting."

Millard: "Anyway, I'm off for a delicious walk." *He hobbled up onto his feet and brushed his robes.*

Twortz: "What exactly makes it a delicious walk?"

Millard: "I picture the floor as a sea of cotton candy, and you can ride on the cotton waves of goodness."

Twortz: "..."

Millard: "Bahaha, I'm joking, silly sausage."

Twortz: "Cotton candy? Sausages? Are you still hungry?"

Millard: "Bahaha, they're just the types of words I use."

Twortz: "Perhaps use more descriptive words, such as, ahem-" *She coughed to clear her throat.* "I'm off for a transcendental walk."

Millard: "Eww." *He hobbled towards the Spacial Funnel and stepped through it, causing his image to warp.* "Stay out of trouble."

Twortz: "..."

Millard: *He hobbled out into the courtyard and looked up, noticing the stars and moon.* "My oh my.. What a day.."

*Millard spoke on his breath and slowly walked across the courtyard, enjoying the night sky.*

Millard: "Surprising how much time is spent talking to interesting people..."

*Millard mumbled with a widening smile and adjusted his cone-shaped hat.*

Millard: (Kathalestel, I missed you once again..) *He stopped his train of thought and stared out with an emotionless face.* "How can I help you?"

Twortz: *She silently stood behind Millard, staring at his back.* "Could you please help me materialise my weapon?"

Millard: "Why?"

Twortz: "Because you said you could."

Millard: "Don't misinterpret me, child. I offered and you didn't want it."

Twortz: "I apologise."

Millard: "Apology accepted."

Twortz: "So, will you teach me?"

Millard: "Oh? Good gravy, doesn't mean I will just because you apologised."

Twortz: "Truth is, I don't like getting insulted because of my physical appearance, and the choice of weapon I've been using.." *She ended the sentence as if it was obvious what the problem was.*

Millard: (Being large and attacking with a frying pan.. That does hold some comical stigma-)

Twortz: "I understand if you don't wish to do so.. I've grown to accept no as an answer."

Millard: "There's no easy way out of things.. To get considerable results, you must put the same amount of hard work into it."

Twortz: "I know the moralities of working." *She placed her hands behind her back, standing in a professional-like manner.*

Millard: "Release your weapon.. Perhaps it was fate for me to teach you on this beautiful night."

Twortz: *She looked up and stared at the stars, causing her to gasp in disbelief.* "Wow."

Millard: "What-?" *He looked up and held his cone-shaped hat with one hand in confusion.* "Is it a flying pan?"

Twortz: "It's called a frying pan-" *She reached over her shoulder and pulled forward, causing sparks to swirl around the pan.*

Millard: "I know-" *He sighed with a smile.*

Twortz: "Where I'm from, you don't see all these stars.. What is that smoky cloud?"

Millard: "Perhaps a galaxy? I'm not entirely sure. I like to believe, you should research everything in one's own world before looking upon others."

Twortz: "Explain?"

Millard: "Why should you look into other people's houses when your one needs a major cleaning itself?"

Twortz: (Such strange examples, yet, he still portrays what he wants to say well.)

Millard: "I can teach you the extremity if you're willing to learn."

Twortz: "I don't care how hard it is! I will always do my best!"

Millard: "Splendid." *He clapped his hands and took a step forward, focusing on the frying pan.*

Twortz: "What am I to do with this?"

Millard: "Nothing. I want to cook eggs in the morning."

Twortz: "What..?"

Millard: "Now, what you will be doing is over-driving your body."

Twortz: "How does one do that?"

Millard: "Hermm." *He placed his hand on his chin.* "I got an idea. A self-inflicting glyph."

Twortz: "What are they?"

Millard: "It's a special glyph that hastens the body's system, allowing their power to tremendously increase."

Twortz: "Forcefully speeding up the body.. Wouldn't that damage it?"

Millard: "Yes-"

Twortz: "I'll do it."

Millard: "So eager?"

Twortz: "Does it matter? I have the drive to do so."

Millard: "Yes." *He hobbled up to Twortz and reached out, touching her shoulder.*

Twortz: "I'm ready."

Millard: *He nodded his head.* "Self-inflicting glyph!-"

Twortz: *Black tattoo-like lines drew themselves down her arm, causing a slight sizzling sound to be heard.* "It burns a little-"

Millard: "It's the run down you should be worried about-"

Twortz: "Run down?" *She looked at Millard in confusion, as the markings scattered across her face.*

Millard: "What do you feel-?"

Twortz: *She accidentally dropped the frying pan, causing a shock wave to explode the ground.* "Wha-?"

Millard: "Settle down, lassy! Your powers have almost tripled!"

Twortz: "M-My apologies."

Millard: *He quickly tiptoed up to the frying pan and awkwardly kicked it away, while withdrawing his arms away from Twortz.* "Okies.."

Twortz: *She watched the frying pan spin away.* "What would you like me to do?"

Millard: "Remember when you manipulated my flame?"

Twortz: "With Neurons or Astragons?"

Millard: *He smiled, as if he was relieved Twortz was intelligent.* "First, Neurons."

Twortz: "Okay, what about them?"

Millard: "Simply, release it."

Twortz: "All of it?"

Millard: "Yes."

Twortz: "Okay." *She straightened herself up and took a deep breath.* (Neurons, okay-)

*A pulse of debris blew away from Twortz, as a soft humming started to echo from her.*

Millard: *He noticed his robes gently flap back, causing him to take a step back from Twortz.* (She's doing it so fast-)

Twortz: (Pouring my Neurons through concentration, it feels like a different variant of excitement-)

Millard: "Now, the self-inflicting glyph is going to naturally boost that feeling-"

Twortz: "Boost my-" *She started to scream, as if she was on a carnival ride.*

*Winds started to blow around Twortz and glyphs along the courtyard started to respond to her presence.*

Millard: (Even the city is responding to her power!-)

Twortz: "It feels like I'm on a roller coaster!" *Her voice echoed in the wind, as visible squalls of lights swayed around her.*

*Orbs of white light started to materialise and float around Twortz, causing Millard to giggle in accomplishment.*

Millard: "Now, with the Astragons, condense all the orbs around you into one!"

Twortz: "Ah!-, ah!-, how do I do that?!" *Her screams echoed several times.*

Millard: "Astragons, despite the different levels of extremity, it's still the same thing!"

Twortz: "Ckee-" *She swayed her arms and started to concentrate, causing the light to sway in the opposite direction.*

*The light suddenly thickened and merged into spirals in front of Twortz, slowly condensing into an orb.*

Twortz: (This is so hard to control-) *She started to sweat and took deep breaths, blowing through her mouth as if she was pregnant.*

*Twortz spread her arms around the orb and it condensed, causing it to glow brighter.*

Millard: "Now.. What to you hear?"

Twortz: "The swirling, echoing, glowing wind, blowing in my ears?! What a stupid question!"

Millard: "Now that you've condensed it, I'm just winging it now!" *He sarcastically squealed.*

Twortz: "Winging it?!"

Millard: "I'm not a Score User, I don't know!" *He crossed his arms over his face, as if he was trying to banish Twortz.*

Twortz: "What am I meant-?" *A heartbeat-like pulse thumped through her chest, followed by the sounds of music.* "Did you-?"

Millard: "Did you hear something?! I've only had two Score User captains under my wing, I'm just going by memory-"

Twortz: "It sounded like a musical instrument-"

Millard: "Now, it's a similar process when you sucked your weapon inside your own Spacial Funnel, use that feeling, but try and draw the sounds closer."

Twortz: "The sounds-" *She closed her eyes and listened to swirls of violin chords play through her ear.* "It sounds so new to me, but feels like it's a part of me-"

Millard: "That's because it is. It's the materialisation of one's own Astragons, your being."

Twortz: "Ah!-" *She screamed with echoing violin chords and the light flashed, blinding Millard.*

Millard: "Good hot gravy!" *He sarcastically whined and shook his bottom, blinking several times.*

Twortz: "Ah-" *She suddenly dropped to her knees, causing sweat to flick off her forehead.*

Millard: *He watched the light fade into the wind, allowing him to look at Twortz.* "Did it work-?"

Twortz: "Wow.. It's beautiful." *She smiled with watering eyes, staring at a violin in her hand in accomplishment.*

Millard: "Splendid!"

Twortz: *The tattoo-like markings started to sizzle off her body, causing her to frown with a twitching eyebrow in pain.* "Is this actually mine?"

Millard: "Yuppers."

Twortz: *She noticed a dagger inside the handle.* (A dagger? It's placed inside the handle like a stylus to a mobile phone-)

Millard: "I'm very impressed, my succulent friend."

Twortz: "..." *She nodded her head in appreciation.*

Millard: "Now. I better get some rest myself. These old bones might shatter to the touch of tomorrow's sunrise, bahahaha."

Twortz: "Hahahackee."

Millard: *He hobbled towards the Spacial Funnel.* "See you in the morning-"

Twortz: "Millard."

Millard: "Hello! That's me." *He smiled and faced Twortz.*

Twortz: "Why did you leave the warriors? From what I gathered, they hold power across these lands, and from the little things I've heard, they have valuable resources."

Millard: "My lover.. After our first successful captain, he suffered from the rare disease of the yellow-eyed disease."

Twortz: "What actually is that?"

Millard: "Not even I know. If happened shortly before the destruction of the Elementalists."

Twortz: "So-" *She sounded intrigued, as if she was ready to ask more questions.*

Millard: "You can find the history of this world when you're in Silver Wind Island." *He sarcastically yawned, implying he was tired.*

Twortz: "I understand. I sincerely appreciate your assistance in helping me achieve this weapon."

Millard: "And thankies for the frying pan! Can't wait to cook them eggs."

Twortz: "That frying pan is probably very unsanitary."

Millard: "Unsanitary? Bahahaha, bless you." *He chuckled and walked into the Spacial Funnel, causing his body to warp on the other side.*

Twortz: *She looked down and continued to admire the violin.* "Now.. I just need to learn how to play the violin..."

*Twortz smiled to herself and looked up, observing the memorising scene in the night sky.*

Chapter 7: The Marshes' Monster

*Trevour, Nathan, Luna and Destiny slept around the burning firewood, ignoring the rising sun.*

Trevour: "Hermm.." *He slowly stretched his arms over his head, naturally making a moan of relief.*

Champion: "Oh, you're awake." *She spoke in a high pitch of tone and stood in the clearing, staring up at the clouds.*

Trevour: "Heh heh, sure am, miss." *He casually stood up, adjusting the armour he slept on.*

*Trevour looked to his side, noticing Luna and Nathan cuddling each other in a comfortable appearing manner.*

Destiny: "Yue, yue-ue-ue-ue-ue." *She slept in a ball in the middle of Luna and Nathan, purring in a snore-like manner.*

Trevour: *He looked back to the champion, watching her stare into the sky.* "What are you doing, miss?"

Champion: "Just admiring what isn't there."

Trevour: "Sorry, miss?" *He hobbled up to the champion and looked up, staring into the sky.* "..."

Champion: "What do you think?"

Trevour: "It's just the sky..." *He shook his head.* "It's not my thing."

Champion: "Oh my, that's understandable."

Trevour: "It's nice and early. We should be at Silver Wind Island before lunch."

Champion: *She smiled with her eyes closed.* "I'll probably take my leave half way through, if not, just at Silver Wind Island."

Trevour: "Sounds like a fair organised ordeal."

Champion: "What about Luna, Nathan and Destiny?"

Trevour: "Their destiny?"

Champion: "No, the new addition to our team."

Trevour: "Oh, the Scoldrant! My bad, heh heh." *He awkwardly chuckled and turned around, facing the sleeping triplets.*

Champion: (This won't end well-) *She thought to herself in an innocent-like manner and casually hobbled to the side.*

Trevour: *He clapped several times with an upbeat attitude.* "Let's go, Luna, Nathan and Destiny-"

Nathan: "Quiet." *He mumbled under his breath, as if he couldn't be bothered moving.*

Trevour: "Heh heh, let's go, guys!-"

Luna: "I'll shit in your face if you don't shut up." *She grunted with her eyes shut.*

Trevour: "Just a sturdy push, and you'll be halfway to Silver-"

*Nathan's sheathed sword hit Trevour on the forehead, causing him to stagger backwards in shock.*

Trevour: *He rubbed his forehead in shock.* "Come on, everyone! We need to get up-"

*Trevour watched a small rock spiral towards his head, causing him to sway his hand, bursting the rock into dirt.*

Trevour: *He awkwardly chuckled with his eyes closed.* "You don't have any more projectiles-"

*Destiny was thrown into Trevour's head, causing her to suddenly wake up.*

Destiny: "Yeup?!" *She unintentionally scratched Trevour across the face in fright.*

Trevour: "Wha-?!"

Luna: "Aha-" *She smirked with her eyes closed, slowly lowering the arm she used to throw Destiny.*

Trevour: "You villain! Using your poor own Scoldrant as a throwing weapon!" *He stamped his foot forward and pouted, causing Nathan to smirk.* "N-Not you too, sir?!"

Champion: "Now that that little scene has finished, maybe we should leave some time soon?" *She hobbled behind Trevour, holding Nathan's sword in one hand and Destiny in the other.*

Trevour: "I-I'm trying, miss."

----------

*Lezard, Rachael and Karol slowly staggered out of the Spacial Funnel, stretching half-asleep as if they just woke up.*

Rachael: *She crossed her arms and stretched them in an athletic-like manner.* "Good morning."

Millard: *He squatted in the middle of the courtyard with his back facing the party.* "Good evening, my delicious children."

Karol: *He sniffed several times.* "Yhummy, what's that smell?"

Lezard: "It appears father monster is cooking us some succulent delicious eggs." *He giggled, shaking his bottom in excitement.*

Karol: "I-I'm weally hungi."

Rachael: "Hungi? Naww, that's cute."

Karol: "Nee hee."

Millard: "Got me some scrambled eggs in tha barbi." *He purposely spoke in a foreign accent, causing Rachael to chuckle.*

Rachael: "Hehe, nice accent!"

Millard: "Thankies."

Lezard: *He flared his nose and sniffed the air, causing him to spiral like a ballerina.* "This smell, rouses the senses, bwarharh."

Rachael: "Where's Twortz?"

Millard: "She's over there-" *He pointed to a bush, drawing the party's attention towards it.*

Lezard: "And father monster drew our attention to some sort of-" *He leant forward, squinting his eyes in disgust.* "A creature lurking in the bushes?"

Rachael: "Oh man..." *She pulled an awkward face, watching Twortz snore, tangled up in bamboo vine-like bushes.*

Karol: "Sh-She's even skcawier!"

Lezard: "Her hair looks like the vines out of a sea serpent's crack!-"

Millard: *He hissed in Twortz's general direction.* "I got a startle myself, I hobbled out, minding my own business and I noticed that-" *He waved his finger around Twortz's general direction.* "Scenario-"

Rachael: *She silently stared at Twortz, as if she was embarrassed for her.* "..."

Millard: "I was like, jinkies! This place didn't have a scarecrow last night!"

Karol: "Nee hee."

Rachael: "Hehe-" *She covered her mouth, as if she knew she shouldn't be laughing at that.*

Millard: "My little monster. Could you please wake her up? She had a big night."

Lezard: "Okies!" *He giggled and saluted with three fingers, emphasising his loyalty.*

Millard: "Millard is sad, Razzymotto-"

Lezard: "It's actually Razzypoo, gosh!"

Rachael: "Hehe, I'd prefer Razzymotto over Razzypoo-"

Lezard: *He gasped loudly while walking up to Twortz.* "I thought we were friends!"

Millard: "Yum yums is up!" *He giggled and raised the frying pan in accomplishment, revealing a full pan of scrambled egg.*

Karol: "Wow!" *He quickly trotted up to Millard, staring at the eggs with a widening smile.*

Millard: "Ah, back away, little one. This is for all of us! Not just you."

Karol: "S-Sowwy." *He looked away and pouted.*

Millard: "My old bones-" *He spoke with a smile, placing one hand on his chest.* "Who can stay cranky at a face like that."

Karol: "Nee hee."

Rachael: (How long has he been here by himself?) *She watched Karol receive an egg sandwich from Millard, observing his excitement.* (It looks like he hasn't had a decent meal in years-)

Karol: (It's been a few days.. I was getting vewy bored of eating cold dry brwead-) *He thought in happiness, while enthusiastically eating the egg sandwich.*

Lezard: "..." *He stood on the spot and stared at Twortz, watching her sleep face-first in the dirt with her bottom sticking up in the air, supported by the bamboo-like vines.* "Twortz, get up."

Twortz: "Would you like a large?!" *She woke up with a loud snort.*

Lezard: "No thankies." *He turned around without saying anything else and hobbled away.*

Twortz: *She sighed in exhaustion and slowly removed the vines which were tangled around her wrists.* (Without any immediate experience, the strings, the chords, the musical talent, it all came to me like instinct.)

*Twortz stood up and brushed excess vegetation off her body, causing her to notice faint red lines where the tattoo-like glyphs were.*

Twortz: *She stepped out of the bushes and slowly waddled towards the party, gently rubbing one of the faint lines on her hand.* (How unprofessional of me-. To be seen in such a state.)

Millard: "And for my growing boy-" *He handed Lezard a sandwich, causing him to giggle.*

Lezard: "Looks poopy, but smells yummy."

Millard: "And for the sensational lady-" *He raised his arm, presenting a sandwich to Rachael.*

Rachael: *She shook her head with a smile.* "No thanks, I'm not hungry."

Millard: "Oh?"

Twortz: *She waddled next to Rachael and noticed the sandwich, causing Millard to present it towards her instead.* "Much appreciated."

Rachael: "I don't remember falling asleep, what else did I miss last night?"

Lezard: "Well, I slain a few dragons, rescued the damsel in distress and saved the world."

Rachael: "Hehe-"

Twortz: "Ahem. By what Millard stated last night, Silver Wind Island is the place to go for answers."

Millard: "Indeed."

Twortz: "You mentioned something about a teleportation glyph?"

Karol: "..." *He silently listened to the party, while eating the sandwich with both hands.*

Millard: "I thought after having a nice morning meal, we could embark on our adventure."

Rachael: "And this is the biggest city?"

Millard: "Yes-" *He looked at Lezard, catching his attention.* "Maybe you should escort these children in the city?"

Lezard: "But, what about our hunt for mother monster-?"

Millard: *He shook his head.* "I'll let you know as soon as I find anything else out."

Lezard: "Does that mean we've lost her?"

Millard: "Yes.."

Lezard: "But we were so close."

Millard: "I know.."

Karol: "I-If she's the Konsultant, why don't you go to Sowwowpwax?"

Twortz: "The child has a valid point."

Millard: "I tried it once.. Even these old bones have trouble handling her and additional high-ranking captains at once.."

Lezard: (Mum..)

Twortz: *She finished the sandwich, causing her to brush her hands together in a professional-like manner.* "I am ready to leave effective immediately."

Millard: *He slowly stood up and swayed his hand, causing a wave of red flames to burn everything off the frying pan clean.* "This will be a delicious treat to use in the future."

*Millard spoke with a giggle and spun the frying pan over his shoulder, causing it to warp into nothing.*

Rachael: "Wow." *She leant forward, observing the area around Millard's back.* "It's gone!"

Millard: "Bahahaha, yes it is, little one."

Rachael: "Where did it go?"

Lezard: "Nobody knows, dun dun duun." *He spoke mysteriously in a sarcastic-like manner.*

Millard: "Baha, just an Astragon pocket."

Rachael: "Who needs bags if you can do that!"

Millard: "True, true. But the average person can only focus-hold on one item."

Twortz: "..." *She had images of concealing her violin from the night before.*

Rachael: "Focus hold?"

Millard: "Just a term I like to use to describe the ability to store one's weapon."

Rachael: *She smiled.* "That's still amazing."

Millard: "Aww, stop. You're making these old bones blush."

Karol: "Nee hee." *He giggled at Millard.*

Rachael: "I was wondering-" *She looked at Karol, catching his attention.* "Karol."

Karol: "Y-Yhes?"

Rachael: "Would you like to join us?"

Karol: "J-Join you?" *He leant back slightly startled at the idea.*

Twortz: "Excuse me?" *She spoke in a disapproving-like manner.*

Lezard: "Ooo, plot twist!"

Karol: "W-Why?"

Rachael: "It was something I noticed last night."

Karol: "Lhast nyght?"

Rachael: *She shook her head as if it didn't matter.* "It's better than being alone here-"

Twortz: "You must understand the responsibilities it takes to look after a child."

Rachael: "And leaving a child by himself is okay with you?"

Twortz: *She paused, as if she didn't know what to say.* "I don't-"

Karol: *He slowly shook his head.* "I dhon't know any of yoohs."

Rachael: "Really?" *She sounded unconvinced.*

Millard: (This could work out better than I planned. The child's food supply will run out in a few weeks, who knows what will happen to the youngster by then-)

Rachael: "What if those bad people come back for you?"

Millard: "Indeed. I might not be around to fend them off next time."

Karol: "..."

Lezard: "What do you say, kiddo? Wanna become team bestie?"

Millard: "Ooo, pick me, pick me!" *He giggled and waved his hand in the air above him.*

Twortz: (Seriously, why do they talk like that? Can't they just speak normally for once?)

Karol: "No.. My home is here."

Rachael: "Home..."

Karol: (She sounds sad-) *He intensely stared at Rachael, triggering a flashback.*

----------

Twortz: *She yawned, as she struggled to stay alert.* "I will listen to as much as I can, but I'm quite tired."

Karol: "..." (I feel comfortable with these people..)

Rachael: "This feels so odd.. We currently don't have a home."

Karol: *He discreetly stared at Rachael with a dropping jaw.* (She doesn't have a home?)

Millard: "My condolences, little monster."

Twortz: "If joining the warriors isn't an option, where is Silver Wind Island?"

Karol: "Isn't that citee all the way up at the other end of the continent?"

----------

Lezard: "Despite what's better for our little hero, we can't force him to come."

Twortz: "Exactly."

Rachael: "..."

Millard: (If he declines the offer, I'll just focus on what I was going to do-)

Rachael: (I was hoping he'd accept my request.)

Millard: *He looked at Karol, deep in thought.* (I'll periodically bring the child year's worth of food supplies.. I can't help but feel responsible for what my love did to his city.)

Karol: *He looked down, ignoring the crumbs which were left on the sides of his mouth.* (I want to stay here, just in case evewyone walks back into the city-)

Rachael: *She sighed, nodding her head in understanding.* "Okay. It's been a pleasure meeting you, Karol."

Twortz: "You weren't that bad for a child." *She looked away, speaking in a professional-like manner.*

Lezard: "Too bad, we could've been hide and seek buddies."

Millard: "Keep safe, little one."

Karol: "F-Fanks.." *He unintentionally pouted.*

Twortz: "We must move on." *She coughed and purposely spoke to Millard, as if she knew he was the acting party leader.*

Millard: "Of course." *He glanced at each party member and faced the city's entrance.* "Let's go."

Karol: *He waved with a saddened smile, watching the party walk away from him.* (I want to go.. But-.) *He glanced over his shoulder, observing the city's ruins.*

----------

*Nathan, Luna, Destiny, Trevour and the champion stretched in different positions, as if they were just waking up.*

Trevour: *He gently touched a cat-like scratch on his face, before glancing at Nathan.* "How are you feeling?"

Nathan: "A little better."

Champion: "Oh my, that's great."

Destiny: "Yeup." *She meowed in agreement, comfortably sitting in Luna's arms.*

Luna: *She rubbed Destiny with her thumbs, causing her to purr.* "Are we goin' or wat?" *She grunted in an annoyed-like manner.*

Trevour: "Of course, madam." *He started to hobble down the naturally made path between the two different forests.* "Just head up North until we reach the ocean, then move a little West until we reach the island."

Luna: *She started to follow Trevour, guided by Destiny's black and white, sketch-like vision.* (My perception is a little off due to following her eyesight.. But, it's great to see again, aye.)

Champion: *She hobbled to each side, focusing her attention to Nathan.* "What do you remember?"

Nathan: *He looked to his side, staring at the champion's enormous hunchback.* "Where I'm from.. Scoldrants and their Users."

Trevour: "Excellent, sir!"

Nathan: "And-" *He adjusted the sword on his back and walked ahead of the party, causing Trevour to look confused.*

Trevour: "Don't travel too fast, sir, it could get temperamental further ahead-"

Nathan: *He smirked with confidence.* "Now I know my way around these woods."

Trevour: "Sir?"

Champion: "He's a Scoldrant User, their instinctive abilities allows them to have inbuilt maps in their navigational skills." *She hobbled past Trevour, as she slowly followed Nathan.*

Luna: *She looked to her side, watching the champion hobble to each side with every step.* "Aye? They've got an automatic GPS system or somethin'?"

Champion: "Umm..?" *She sounded confused.*

Trevour: *He hobbled by the champion's side.* "I'm a little confused too."

Nathan: "Haha. It differs with every Scoldrant User, some have the ability to never forget the terrain once they've stepped foot in the area, others can communicate with the environment."

Luna: "Talkin' to plants, that could be some trippy shit, if you know what I mean."

Trevour: "What about you, sir?"

Nathan: "I'm just good with the terrain."

Luna: "Pssht, lame."

Nathan: I'm not a Scoldrant User."

Destiny: "Yeup."

Nathan: "You're probably classed as one now."

Luna: "Aye?"

Champion: "Oh, that's right! You're Soul Linked now."

Destiny: "Yeup!" *She purred in agreement.*

Luna: "We're just that awesome." *She spoke with confidence, pretending to be cool.*

Nathan: "But, there's something you should know.."

Trevour: (His tone, it doesn't sound good-)

Luna: "Yea, wat?"

Nathan: "Whatever happens to either one of you, will happen to the other."

Luna: "Huh?" *She grunted with her mouth open.*

Nathan: "Something as powerful as a Soul Link would have its drawbacks."

Luna: "That kinda didn't answer my question, aye."

Nathan: *He sighed.* "If one of you gets hurt, so will the other."

Luna: "Oh, that doesn't sound bad."

Destiny: "Yeup!"

Trevour: *He looked up, as if he was thinking about it.* "What would happen if one of them were to receive a life threatening wound?"

Nathan: *He smirked in a serious-like manner, as if he wanted that question to be answered.* "Then the other will die too."

----------

Lezard: "So, our heroes walk outside the city and gather around father monster, watching him pull out a small grey stone with purple writing on it-"

Twortz: "Please, do whatever you do to activate those stones." *She spoke in an annoyed-like manner, as if she was tired of Lezard's immaturity.*

Millard: "Of course."

Rachael: *She looked over her shoulder, staring at the distant ruins in a saddened manner.* (I'm not sure if it's because he saved me, but I felt like I had a connection with Karol.. Good luck with all your future endeavours-)

Millard: *He closed his eyes and tightened his grip around the stone, causing it to glow purple.* "Okies-"

*Millard dropped the stone, causing an expanding purple glyph to draw itself underneath the party's feet.*

Rachael: *She looked down, staring at the glyph in amazement.* (I wonder how long it will take until the wow factor will go away-)

Lezard: *He noticed Rachael's face.* "Wait until we get to Silver Wind Island, it'll be amazing." *He giggled, wiggling his bottom to each side.*

Millard: "I personally think Surpreon is the better city."

Lezard: "Surpreon? Eww, why, father monster?"

Millard: "Silver Wind Island is too busy for these old bones. Maybe in my younger days, I would've enjoyed being rubbed against by many randoms and having the loud sounds of sizzle and chatter coming in from every direction."

Twortz: "What?"

Millard: "It's very busy for my liking."

Twortz: *She face palmed.* (Why doesn't he just say so? His whole sentence was grammatically flawed, it was too hard to understand what he was trying to say.)

Millard: "We will have a little walk ahead of us before reaching the actual city."

Lezard: "Why?"

Millard: "Just the limitation of that little bugger-" *He looked down to the stone, watching the glyphic markings on it fade away into the glyph.*

Twortz: *She watched the glyph glow a constant brightness, causing her to smile.* "It's ready?" *She glanced at Millard, as if she was unsure.*

Millard: "Yes!"

Rachael: "Hehe, you're getting the hang of this, Twortz."

Twortz: (You have no idea.) "..."

Millard: "Shall we have a countdown?"

Twortz: "No."

Lezard: "Yes!-"

?????: "Wait!" *A young boy's yell caused the party to turn around.*

Rachael: "Karol?"

Karol: "W-Wayt for me!" *He squealed and suddenly tripped on his own foot, causing him to land face-first into the ground.*

Twortz: (Please don't tell me the child is going to join us-)

Karol: "I-I'm coming to jhoin yooh!"

Rachael: (Awesome!-)

Lezard: "Yay!"

Twortz: "Looks like you'll have someone your own age to talk to."

Millard: "Oooo." *He spoke in suspense, glancing at Lezard.*

Lezard: "You're just jealous of our friendship." *He looked away, pretending not to care.*

Twortz: "In some states, that little friendship could be illegal."

Lezard: "Lezard sighed and continued to ignore Twortz."

Twortz: "Are you serious?" *She spoke with a stern voice, glaring at Lezard.*

Rachael: *She ran up to Karol and bent down, helping him back onto his feet.* "You okay?"

Karol: "Yep!"

Rachael: "Let's go." *She spoke with a smile and started to jog back to the glyph.*

Millard: "Quickly, little ones! It's about to transfer us-"

Lezard: *He reached out and grabbed onto Rachael and Karol's hands, quickly pulling them onto the glyph.* "Phew-"

Twortz: *She watched the air blur and swirl around them.* (The area swirls on the borders of this glyph? So, if I've been educated correctly, this is Astragons at work..)

Rachael: "What changed your mind?"

Karol: "Uhm.. Just what you said before."

Rachael: "Oh?" *She sounded happy, but didn't care for the reason.*

Millard: "Welcome to the party, Karol."

Karol: "Nee hee, fanks!"

Lezard: "Onward to Silver Wind Island." *He stamped forward and pointed into a direction, watching colours swirl around the glyph.*

Rachael: (It's amazing..) *She watched the wall of colours continue to swirl, making it not possible to see through the glyph.* (It's like we're in a car, how the sounds are moving outside-)

*Rachael took a step forward and reached towards the edge of the glyph, readying to touch the warping area behind her.*

Lezard: "You shouldn't do that."

Rachael: *She withdrew her hand and stepped to the side, glancing at Lezard.* "Why?"

Millard: "Unless you're very skilled, the implications of prematurely stepping off a teleportation glyph while it's still active is far too dangerous."

Lezard: "Yuppers." *He enthusiastically nodded his head.*

Millard: "I've had captain classed warriors come back with missing arms, or worse."

Rachael: "Worse?"

Millard: "They prematurely teleported through or into a solid object."

Karol: "H-Holy Neurons!" *He squealed in fear.*

Rachael: "So, it's like stepping out of a moving vehicle.. Got it." *She whispered to herself, purposely stepping closer to the middle of the glyph.*

----------

*Nathan and Trevour led the party down the enclosed grassy pathway, listening to the different sorts of leaves bristling in the wind.*

Nathan: *He suddenly stepped on mud, causing him to look down.* "What is-?"

Trevour: "Sir?" *He stopped, causing his armour to stop rattling.* "Oh?"

Luna: "Wat's the holdup? Sore legs, ya big girls?"

Champion: "Oh my, nobody is large in this party." *She spoke in a high innocent-like tone of voice.*

Luna: "That's not wat I meant, aye."

Champion: *She watched Nathan and Trevour bend down to inspect the mud, causing her to tilt her head in curiosity.* "What's wrong?"

Nathan: "This mud, it shouldn't be here."

Trevour: *He looked down and twiddled his fingers, causing the mud to slowly swirl to his command.* (It moves like baking mix-)

Nathan: "We're far from any desert and The Swirling Marshes is quite far away."

Trevour: "This mud has come from a creature."

Luna: "Aye? How can ya tell?"

Trevour: "I only need to pour my Astragons in this mud for it to move."

Luna: "Wat does that mean?" *She frowned.*

Trevour: "It means, it already has Neurons in there."

Champion: "Like Scoldrant droppings?"

Trevour: "Close." *He stood up straight and faced the way he was walking.* "We should go."

Nathan: *He rubbed a speck of mud in between his fingers.* (There aren't any Scoldrants that live around here that produces mud like this..)

Trevour: (Whatever left behind this trail-) *He noticed snail-like smears of mud trail further into the forest.* (It must be powerful-)

Luna: *She listened to creaking branches in the distance, causing her to shiver.* (What is this feeling? Am I scared? Pssht! I haven't been scared like this in ages..)

Nathan: *He nodded his head and stood up, wiping the mud off his fingers.* "No more breaks."

Luna: "Pssht, wateva." *She grunted and rudely followed Trevour.*

Nathan: "What did I say?" *He grunted with a frown.*

Champion: "Oh my. It appears she doesn't like being told what to do." *She smiled in an innocent-like manner and started to hobble after Trevour and Luna.*

Nathan: *He silently frowned at Luna's back with a confused smirk.* "Whatever."

----------

*A flash of purple light caused the surrounding insects to temporarily become quiet.*

Millard: "End of the line." *He stepped off the fading glyph and leant to the side, stretching his lower back.*

Lezard: *He spun around, noticing he stood in a small clearing with large trees swaying in a cool breeze.* "We're near an ocean, you can smell the salt in the air."

Karol: *He adjusted his dancer-like clothes, observing his surroundings.* (I have no idea where I am.)

Millard: "If you can smell the ocean, we can't be far from Silver Wind Island."

Twortz: (Finally.)

Rachael: "Can everyone use those teleportation glyphs?"

Lezard: "Nope. Teleportation glyphs are very hard to utilise let alone being able to actually use one."

Millard: "Only people close to Grey and Season would be lucky enough to use such devices."

Twortz: "Devices like the stone you used before?"

Millard: "Yes."

Rachael: "So, using Rostical is rare, then using a teleportation glyph would be even rarer?"

Millard: "That's exactly right."

Karol: *He nodded his head.* "Only the stwongest dancers can use tele-port-.. Glyffs. Not many people can use them."

Lezard: *He licked his finger and pointed it up into the air.* "Okies, this way everyone."

Millard: "Splendid." *He giggled and adjusted the cone-shaped hat on his head.* "And we embark on another adventure!"

Lezard: "When will you be leaving, father monster?"

Millard: "Well, I was thinking in the next four seconds?"

Lezard: "Okies." *He smiled with a mixture of emotion, as if he didn't want him to leave.*

Twortz: "You're leaving us?"

Millard: "Oh? Am I not allowed to?" *He stopped, looking at Twortz in a worried-like manner.*

Twortz: "No, but your assistance has been proven to be quite helpful."

Millard: "Naww, but, I've got my own little adventure to embark on." *He spoke with a smile and held out another grey stone with purple markings on it.*

Rachael: *She formed fists, as if she was unintentionally stretching them.* (Hanging out with Millard, the reality of all this supposed rarity won't really hit us until he's gone.)

Twortz: (He might act childish like Lezard, but at least he answers majority of my questions-)

Lezard: "Oh, father monster-" *He placed the back of his hand on his forehead, dramatising the situation.* "Please contact me as soon as you find mother monster's whereabouts!"

Millard: "Of course, my little monster." *He stepped forward and hugged Lezard, intentionally dropping the stone on the ground, causing a purple glyph to spiral behind him.*

Lezard: "It's been fun travelling with you.. I won't be too long." *He whispered in Millard's ear.*

Millard: "No. Enjoy yourself. Let me find your mother's next hideout and I'll let you know as soon as possible."

Lezard: "How long will that take?"

Millard: "How many years it took until we finally had a lead regarding her attack on The Ruins of Estel?"

Lezard: "But-"

Millard: "I also have to find out why the Consultants are investigating The Unknown Territories."

Lezard: "..."

Millard: "You've seemed to have made friends, get to know them a little better-"

Lezard: "I don't want friends, I want my parents back-"

Millard: "Quiet, my little monster." *He spoke with a smile and stepped back, glancing at Rachael.*

Rachael: *She smiled and placed her hand out for a handshake.* "It was great to meet you, Millard."

Millard: "Ooo, so touching, bahahaha!" *He hobbled to the side and placed both hands around Rachael's.* "These old bones can't wait to see you again."

Rachael: "Hehe."

Twortz: "It's been a pleasure to meet your acquaintance." *She slightly bowed in a respectful manner.*

Millard: "Ooo, too serious!" *He giggled and tapped Twortz's shoulder, causing her to look uncomfortable.*

Karol: "And me?"

Millard: "And who could forget the leader of this party?"

Karol: "W-Who-?"

Millard: "You." *He smiled and placed his hand on Karol's head.* "Don't play up on Razzymotto here, she's doing a lot by taking you under her wing."

Karol: "R-Right!" *He pouted with a frown of determination.*

Millard: "Well then-" *He turned around and hobbled to the glowing glyph, causing him to disappear in a flash of purple light.* "Until next time, children!" *His voice echoed in the fading light.*

Lezard: *He waved his arm over his shoulder.* "Okies!"

Karol: "I liked him." *He smiled at Lezard.*

Lezard: "Me too." *He giggled at Karol.*

Twortz: "Now that you've finished, could we get to Silver Wind Island now?"

Lezard: "Of course-"

*A deep gargling moan echoed in the distance, catching the party's attention.*

Lezard: "Jinkies!-"

Karol: "Holy Neurons!" *He squealed, quickly hiding behind Rachael.*

Lezard: "It's in the opposite way of where we're going-"

Rachael: "Let's go!" *She frowned and suddenly ran towards the sounds of the roar.*

Lezard: "No, the other way!-"

Karol: "Where is she going?"

Twortz: (How foolish-) *She glanced at Lezard.* "Let's continue to Silver Wind Island."

Lezard: "What about Razzypoo-?"

Twortz: "She wants to make rash decisions like that, then let her. We shouldn't have to sacrifice our own safety-"

Karol: *He frowned and puffed out his chest, trying to hide his obvious fear.* "Waichael!" *He squealed and started to run after her, causing Twortz to grunt with widening eyes.*

Twortz: "What are you-?"

Lezard: "If it's an enemy, they'll need my help." *He started to run after Rachael and Karol, causing Twortz to face palm.*

Twortz: (If only I knew where to go-) *She sighed and quickly waddled after the party.*

----------

*A deep gargling moan caught Nathan and Destiny's attention.*

Nathan: "Did any of you hear that?"

Trevour: "No, sir?"

Luna: "Me neither, aye." *She grunted.*

Champion: "Oh my, I didn't hear anything either, Nathan."

Destiny: "Yeup!" *She hissed, causing Luna to look down in confusion.*

Luna: "Wat is it?"

Trevour: "What's wrong with Destiny?"

Luna: (That scared feelin' I experienced before, it wasn't mine, it was hers!-)

Nathan: *He frowned and looked ahead, noticing more mud on the ground.* (Whatever it is, it's in the direction we're heading-)

Luna: "I think we gotta turn back-" *She struggled to contain Destiny in her arms.*

Champion: "We will simply do what we did before. Weaken it to an extent and flee."

Nathan: (That way it won't get hurt-) *He nodded his head and started to run down the path, purposely stepping into the mud.* "Alright-"

Luna: "Sorry, we gotta get through there." *She whispered to Destiny in concern.*

Destiny: "Yueee-hhst." *She hissed in understanding.*

Champion: *She hobbled past Luna and Trevour, making her way towards Nathan.* (He's quick-)

Trevour: "Madam?" *He spoke to Luna, implying for her to start running.*

Luna: "Yea, yea-"

Nathan: "Ah?!" *He ran into a clearing and looked up in shock, staring at an enormous mud-like Scoldrant.*

Champion: "What's the-?" *She paused and stepped back in shock, staring at the mud monster with widening eyes* "Oh my! It's very strong!"

Nathan: "It's the Swirling Marshes' Guardian!"

Champion: "How is that possible? We're very far away from The Swirling Marshes!"

Guardian: *It noticed Nathan and the champion, causing it to slowly swirl its upper body, allowing it to face them without moving its base.* "Gloar!"

*Luna and Trevour ran into the clearing, instantly noticing the Guardian.*

Luna: "Holy shit bitch!-, dude!"

Trevour: "L-Looks like we found ourselves in a temperamental situation here!"

Guardian: "What causes the marshes to become corrupt? Why do I feel corrupted?"

Trevour: "I-It talks!-"

Luna: "So-?!"

Trevour: "It means it's a Guardian!"

Nathan: *He quickly grabbed onto his sword and pulled forward, standing in a battle-ready pose.* "Still up to the challenge, champion?"

Champion: *A blue glyph shined underneath her.* "Of course."

Trevour: "I'll have to be sturdy with my movements!" *He staggered into mid-range and bent his knees, tightening his body for a sturdier stance.*

Nathan: (Now that my head isn't cloudy, I should be able to fight reasonably well-)

Guardian: "You humans, are you the cause of such corruption?"

Luna: "Wat the hell is that thing talkin' about?"

Nathan: "The yellow-eyed disease-"

Guardian: "It hurts!-"

Luna: *She spread her arms, causing Destiny to hop onto her shoulder.* "OK, asshat-"

*Luna reached over her shoulder and grabbed the bow which hung off a container, filled with arrows.*

Luna: *She reached over her shoulder again and picked out a single arrow, queuing her to stand in a battle-ready pose.* "Ready when you are."

Nathan: "Don't be stupid! You're blind with bare minimal eyesight, you can't possible expect to-"

Luna: *She ignored Nathan and pulled the string back, aiming the bow in Nathan's general direction.* (How can I be blind but still have eyesight? Dumbass-)

Nathan: "Don't be stupid!-"

Luna: "Hah-" *She released the string and the arrow pierced right past Nathan, hitting the Guardian right on the forehead.* "Aha-" *She smiled and picked out another arrow.*

Trevour: "Wow-"

Luna: "Right on target-"

Guardian: "Useless means by a useless race-" *Its mud swirled down its face, causing the arrow to fade into its body.*

Luna: (Damn-)

Champion: *She gasped, alerting the party.* "Its Neurons just boosted! It's ready to attack!-"

Guardian: "My head! It hurts!-" *Its arm suddenly extended and slammed onto the ground.*

Nathan: *He looked to the side, noticing the arm suddenly extend past the party.* "It's going to sweep!-"

Guardian: "Rolling Mudslide." *It swayed its arm, causing a mud-like wave to crash across the party.*

Nathan: "Air Slash." *He quickly sliced the sword towards, slashing a visible air wave towards the arm.*

Trevour: "DUST STORM" *He suddenly punched above him, causing a swirling dirt cloud to explode around him.*

Champion: "Luna!-" *She quickly hobbled closer to Luna in desperation, ignoring a white glyph which materialised under her feet.*

Luna: "Shit, I don't know any-"

Champion: "MYSTIC SHIELD" *She swayed her arms, causing a bubble-like swirl of light to spiral around them.*

Luna: "Quickly!-"

Destiny: "Yeup!" *She hissed in fear.*

Champion: *She listened to the bubble-like shield solidify into glass, causing the Guardian's arm to smash into and past shield.* "Close-"

Luna: *She watched the arm continue to rumble behind the shield, knocking down some trees.* (Crap!-)

Nathan: *He ignored the mud which splattered past his shoes.* "Hmph-" *He charged towards the Guardian, raising his sword in determination.*

Champion: *She lowered her arms, causing the shield to shatter away.* "At this present point in time, I won't be able to cast Rostical while raising the shield without revealing my presence."

Luna: "Fine by me!-" *She quickly focused back to the Guardian, pulling the string to her bow.* (I didn't spend years learning Archery for nothing!-)

Nathan: "Double Slash." *He quickly sliced the sword across, causing a string of mud to burst off the Guardian.*

Guardian: "How dare you!-" *It raised its other arm and flicked it like a whip towards Nathan.*

Nathan: "Harh!" *He leant to the side and slashed upwards in a fluid-like manner, slicing off the Guardian's fingers.*

Trevour: (For a Guardian.. The rumours.. It's rather weak-) *He dropped to his knees and punched the ground, causing a brown glyph to zigzag under his feet.* "SWIRLING SANDPIT"

Guardian: *Another arm suddenly shot out of its belly, punching towards Nathan's ribs.* "A weak spot!-"

Nathan: *He looked to the side, grunting with widening eyes.* (I won't be able to dodge!-)

*An arrow suddenly shot into the Guardian's arm, distorting the mud around its fingers, causing it to miss Nathan.*

Luna: "Aha-" *She smirked, taking another arrow from the container.*

Destiny: "Yeup!" *She purred in accomplishment, as if she was helping Luna strike her targets.*

Nathan: (Wow, she's not bad-) *He jabbed forward, ignoring a shade of blue his body glowed.* "Raining Fury."

*Nathan raised the sword against his cheek and jabbed the sword like a missile, causing small holes to burst in the Guardian's stomach.*

Guardian: *It noticed sand swirl around its side, causing it to lean at an angle.*

Champion: "ICICLE EDGE"

Guardian: "Rotten Slab." *It swayed its arm, causing a stream of thick brown mud to whip in the air, smashing the forming ice spears.*

Champion: *She watched ice rain on the ground in failure.* "Oh my?"

Luna: "Harh!" *She released the string, shooting an arrow into the Guardian's beady black eye.*

Guardian: "How dare you-"

Luna: "Yea, ya already said that aye." *She smirked, grabbing another arrow from the container.* (I've got about twelve arrows remaining. The only thing I disliked about guns and bows-)

Champion: *She cupped her hands and focused on the guardian, watching a small spiralling red glyph materialise in front of her fingers.* "FLAME BOLT"

Nathan: *He sighed and evasively stepped back, watching the holes in the Guardian's stomach fill itself with more mud.* "It regenerates fast!-"

Trevour: *He watched the Guardian's body pump the quicksand he created, causing its body to grow.* "M-My Rostical! It's using the sand to its advantage!-"

Nathan: "How is its body growing-?"

*A mud made arm suddenly shot up from the ground and punched Nathan off his feet, blasting him back across the ground.*

Trevour: "Sir!-" *He shouted in worry and quickly punched the ground, causing a swirl of sand to erupt before Nathan hit the ground.* "DUST STORM"

Nathan: *He slid on the soft sand, causing him to grunt in appreciation.* (Crap-)

Champion: *She pushed forward, shooting five fireballs at the Guardian.* "Please repent."

Guardian: "ROCK PILLAR"

*A large wall of mud erupted in front of it and quickly hardened into rock, causing the fireballs to explode upon impact.*

Champion: "Oh my, it also knows Rostical-"

Guardian: "Blinding dust, rain down-" *It punched the rock wall in front of it and shattered it to pieces.*

Champion: "MYSTIC SHIELD" *She screamed with an echoing voice, causing a bubble-like shield to solidify into glass around her and Luna.*

Guardian: "ROCK SLIDE" *It pushed forward, blasting the airborne pebbles at the party.*

Trevour: "Prepare for some turbulence!-" *He quickly turned around and ducked down, covering his head.*

Nathan: *He quickly raised the sword, readying himself.* "Harh!" *He sliced to the side, cutting a pebble away.*

*Luna, Destiny and the champion watched small dents crack in the shield, as the pebbles violently shot past them.*

Champion: *She frowned with a twitching eye.* (If this keeps up, I may need to use Mystic Shield's incantation!-)

Guardian: "You will suffer a Guardian's fury!-"

Nathan: *He quickly tilted the sword to each side, blocking the pebbles.* (This is hurting my wrist-) *He thought with gritted teeth and watched small sparks flash off his sword, followed by a mild vibration in the sword.*

Trevour: *Rocks slash across his back armour, causing sparks to splinter past his head.* "Everyone holding up?!"

Nathan: *He slashed away the remaining pebbles, causing him to quickly swap hands.* "Don't talk!-. Focus on yourself!"

Guardian: "Ougi."

Nathan: "Shit!-"

Trevour: "O-Oh no!"

Champion: *She lowered her arms, causing the shield to shatter away.* "Neurons draw, Astragons repel, MYSTIC SHIELD"

*A bright silver shield instantly raised around each party member.*

Champion: *She leant forward and panted with a loss of breath, as if she was just working out.* (That took a lot of Neurons out of me-)

Luna: "Wat is its Owgee?!"

Champion: "Everyone's Ougi can be different-"

Guardian: "Tangrowth Dirtcloud Talons." *It roared with an echoing gargle and looked up, causing vine-like streams of mud arms to erupt all around the party.*

Trevour: *A stream of mud arm erupted inside the shield, violently punching him across the face.* "Argh!-"

Champion: "Trevour!-"

Nathan: *He watched arms spiral around the shield, cracking it from every angle.* "Champion, release my shield!"

Champion: *She twitched one of her fingers, causing his shield to shatter away.* "Do what you're best at!-"

Nathan: "Grr-" *He rolled to the side, closely avoiding a stream of arms.*

Guardian: "You will not succeed in any more corruption!-"

Luna: *She shot an arrow, causing it to quickly spiral back after hitting the shield.* "Shit-" *She awkwardly stepped to the side, watching the arrow's sketch-like animation spiral past her.*

Champion: "I've raised a shield around you!"

Luna: (I can't see the shield.. I can hear somethin', but I don't know what's wat, aye.)

Trevour: "That hurt-" *The mud arm spiralled back and grabbed him around the throat.* "DUST-"

Guardian: "Gnoal!" *It swayed back, causing the arm which grabbed Trevour to pull forward, smashing him through the shield.*

Trevour: *He tumbled across the ground, watching glass-like aura shatter around him.* "Ouch-"

Luna: "How do you add Newrongs?! Do I even have any?!"

Champion: "You have to if you've Soul Linked with a Scoldrant."

Nathan: *He held the sword with both hands and faced Trevour.* "Air Slash." *He slashed the air upwards, slicing a visible air slash directly towards Trevour.*

Trevour: *He noticed the air slash, causing him to hobble forward, allowing the air slash to slice off the Guardian's arm which held him by the throat.* "Ah!-, much appreciated, sir-"

Nathan: "We're completely out of our league! If I knew it was a Guardian, I would've risked going through The Twilight Forest!-"

Trevour: *He glanced at the mud arms, noticing they momentarily paused.* (Neurons gathered in its arms-?)

Guardian: "Granite Prison." *Its words caused all the arms to suddenly collide around each party member, causing pulses of mud to explode around them.*

Nathan: "Ah-" *He dropped to his knees, as mud slopped off him.* "Its Ougi had a second affect?!"

Trevour: *He stood up, flicking the mud off his shoulders.* (With my natural affinity, I'm more resilient to ground-based attacks-)

Luna: (The shield shattered almost instantly-) *She coughed, wheezing for air.*

Destiny: "Yeup-" *She growled in pain, as mud stuck on to her fur like glue.*

Champion: "Oh my-" *She slowly stood up, glancing at each party member.*

?????: "What's happening here?!" *A woman ran out of the bushes and stepped in mud, causing it to slop around her shoes.*

Luna: "A-Aye-?" *She looked up, staring at the woman in confusion.* "Rachael? Rachael Taylor?!"

Rachael: *She looked at Luna, gasping in shock.* "Luna?!"

Luna: "The fuck are you doin' here?!" *She spoke with a growing smirk.*

Nathan: "Rachael?"

Guardian: "You will not corrupt me any further!-"

Rachael: "Holy shit!-" *She stepped back, staring at the Guardian in fear.*

Lezard: "Razzypoo, what's going-? Holy fish-cakes and call me jinkies!" *He hobbled behind Rachael, instantly squealing at the Guardian.*

Nathan: "Whoever you are, it uses mud!"

Lezard: "So, this isn't an adult party of some sort?" *He scanned across the mud covered area.*

Champion: "Mud is accessible to Rostical Users that have both ground and water affinities. Or, if either one of those affinities is mastered-"

Guardian: "Rotten Slab." *It swayed its arm, causing a stream of thick brown mud to whip in the air towards Rachael and Lezard.*

Rachael: "Tssk-" *She stood in a battle-ready pose and punched to the side, causing a rock pillar to erupt in front of the stream of mud.*

Luna: "Whoa! You're a Rostickal User?!"

Rachael: *She smirked and started to run towards the Guardian.* "Lezard, heal Luna's friends!"

Lezard: "Okies!"

Champion: (Did she say heal?)

Lezard: "Quick healing shot, HEALING IMPLOSION" *He focused his attention to Luna and swayed his arms, causing light to glow in her wounds, queuing it to start rapidly healing.*

Luna: "This wind? It's warm, aye?"

Trevour: (She can't see the light?)

Champion: (I don't!-. Radiatons?!)

Rachael: "Hah!" *She punched towards the Guardian, erupting a rock pillar in the direction of her punch.*

Guardian: *It watched mud spiral around the tip of the rock pillar which jabbed into its chest.* "Useless!"

Rachael: *She continued to move around the Guardian, keeping her fists close to her face.* "Rock Pillar-"

Guardian: "Rotten Slab." *It swayed its arm, causing it to string towards Rachael.*

Luna: "Harh!" *She shot an arrow into its arm, causing its aim to distort.*

Rachael: "Nice!-" *She cartwheeled to the side, watching the arm sway above her.*

Karol: *He stepped into the clearing and slipped on the mud, falling face-first into the ground.* "Owch!"

Lezard: "Quick healing shot-" *He focused his attention to the champion.* "HEALING IMPLOSION"

Champion: *She watched light glow in her visible wounds, queuing it to start rapidly healing.* "Oh my, thank you."

Lezard: *He focused his attention to Trevour.* "Quick healing-"

Trevour: "Please, focus your attention to the guy with the sword!"

Lezard: *He nodded his head, focusing on Nathan.* (I don't see any visible wounds-) "Where are you hurt, mister scary man?!"

Nathan: (Mister what-?!)

Lezard: "Well-?!"

Nathan: "My wrist and ribcage-"

Lezard: "Quick internal light, INVOKING AURA"

*A swirl of warm light flashed around Nathan's chest and wrist, healing his wounds.*

Nathan: "W-Wow?" *He spoke on his breath in amazement, staring at the white light in a memorised-like manner.*

Lezard: "Phew-" *He took a deep breath, glancing at Trevour.* "And mister chunky face, you're up next!"

Champion: *She stood up and watched a green glyph form circles underneath her.* (I will try every element I have and see if I get a reaction!)

Karol: "I-I kan halp!" *He squealed and stood up, catching Nathan's attention.*

Nathan: "Why on The Astral Plains is a child here?!"

Karol: *He started to dance, causing the mud to pulse away from him.* (I can do this!)

Rachael: "Don't underestimate him!" *She punched upwards, causing a sheet of rock to erupt in front of her, blocking a stream of mud.*

Twortz: *She waddled into the clearing and noticed the Guardian.* (That Scoldrant. I get a different vibe from it-)

Nathan: *He stood up straight, raising the sword in determination.* "Air Slash." *He slashed downwards, slicing an air slash towards the Guardian.*

Guardian: "My head.. It's hot.. I can't-" *Its black beady eyes suddenly widened into eerie yellow coloured oval eyes.*

Nathan: "No!" *He grunted in disbelief and watched the air slash hit the Guardian, causing its mud to warp.*

Trevour: (Nathan's attack did nothing!)

Nathan: "Its eyes!-" *He looked back to the party.* "All of its attributes will be increased!-"

Karol: *He swayed in a dancer-like manner and kicked the ground, causing an expanding orange glyph to form around his foot.* "Power Up."

Guardian: "You pests-" *An arrow shot into its head, causing a pulse of mud to explode around the arrow.*

Luna: "Wow, that felt like it had force in it!-" *She looked down, noticing she stood on the orange glyph.*

Twortz: *She casually raised over her shoulder and pulled forward, causing sparks to spiral around her violin.* "Hahackee." *She cackled to herself, as if she was excited to try out her violin.*

Karol: *He continued to dance with a struggling squirm.* (There's currently six people on the glyph, my power will be reduced-)

Champion: (This is a Power Up glyph..) *She hobbled backwards, purposely stepping off the glyph.*

Karol: *He looked at the champion and waved his arms, motioning to stand back on the glyph.* (It won't work-)

Champion: *She shook her head with a smile, as if she knew she didn't need it.* (I don't use its effects as I'm a Rostical User-) 

Karol: *He looked away in understanding, sighing in relief.* (That's a little better. I don't have to focus on that many people-)

Nathan: *He ignored the orange glyph and ran towards the Guardian, purposely hopping over piles of mud which scattered the clearing.* "Double Slash."

*Nathan ran into striking distance and slashed across the Guardian, causing a sudden burst of mud to flick in a slash-line.*

Guardian: "Your power-?!"

Nathan: *He looked surprised and spun in the motion of his strike allowing him to slash downwards, causing the mud on the ground to burst away from his sword.* (What-?!)

Rachael: "Nice!" *She smirked at Nathan and raised her leg, readying herself.* "Piercing Land."

*Rachael kicked the ground, causing two dagger shaped rocks to erupt into the air.*

Rachael: *She caught the daggers in each hand and suddenly sprinted towards the Guardian, instantly slashing the daggers in a combo-like manner.* "Harh!"

Guardian: "Mud Avalanche." *It swayed its arm into the air, causing a volcanic-like spurt of mud to string above the party.*

Champion: "Oh my!-" *She quickly faced the gathering mud with urgency, causing a blue glyph to draw itself under her feet.* "Icy swirls call down upon me, frigid skies grant me power-"

Nathan: *He watched the strings of mud merge together, forming a sheet of mud above them, causing the area to darken.* (Its Ougi is mud from the air?)

Luna: *She looked up and pulled the string back with squinted eyes, causing Destiny's eyes to flash purple.* "I see!-"

*Luna released the string and shot the arrow above her towards the mud, causing a large pulse-like burst of mud to blow away.*

Champion: "ICICLE EDGE" *She swayed her arms down, blasting thick ice spears towards the Guardian from the sky.*

Guardian: "Mud Shot." *It shot out three bullet-sized pebbles towards the ice spears, instantly shattering them in mid-air.*

Trevour: *He looked up and looked at the sheet of mud, noticing a massive hole form above him from where Luna shot her arrow.* (If the Guardian's mud were to fall, it would've crushed me!-) "Much appreciated, madam!-"

*Trevour suddenly hopped forward and punched both arms into the air, causing a swirling vortex of dirt to erupt into the Guardian's stomach.*

Trevour: "DUST STORM"

Guardian: "Yes!" *It gargled a moan, as its body grew in size from Trevour's dirt.*

Nathan: "It absorbs your attack remember?!"

Trevour: *He frowned in a helpless-like manner, causing him to hobble back.* "My bad, sir-"

Rachael: "If you use sand, why don't you use it as a defensive technique instead of an offensive?!" *She shouted at Trevour, while punching slash-like attacks on the Guardian's stomach.*

Trevour: "Offensive?"

Rachael: "Use the dirt or sand as a shield-"

Guardian: "Dirtcloud Talons." *It scratched the air, causing scratch-like streams of mud to slash towards Rachael.*

Trevour: "Miss-?!"

Rachael: *She smirked and quickly punched the ground, causing a large sheet of rock to erupt in front of her.* "Rock Pillar."

Trevour: *He watched strings of mud splatter past Rachael's pillar in realisation.* (I see-)

Rachael: "Heh-" *She cartwheeled to the side and started to back flip, watching strings of mud sway under and above her.*

Karol: *He skipped on each foot and spun around, keeping the orange glyph activated across the clearing.* (I have to keep going.. I'm an Upper, sun of the stronghest dancer!)

Twortz: *She placed her hand on the end of the violin and clipped out a dagger, queuing her to place the violin on her shoulder.* (I will aim to become stronger...)

*Twortz glared at Rachael, watching her slash incoming mud strings with her daggers.*

Twortz: (I will become stronger than her.)

Guardian: "Mud Shot." *It gargled a roar and suddenly shot out two bullet-sized pebbles, shooting one through Nathan's arm.*

Nathan: "Argh!-"

Trevour: "Sir!-"

Luna: (Nathan!-)

Destiny: "Yeup?!"

Lezard: "Jinkies!-"

Nathan: "Forget about me! Just take it down-"

Lezard: "Quick healing shot, HEALING IMPLOSION! Quick internal light, INVOKING AURA"

*A swirl of warm light flashed around Nathan's left shoulder, slowly healing his wounds.*

Nathan: *Flickering light glowed in the wound, queuing it to start rapidly healing.* (This warm light is completely healing a bed ridden wound!-)

Lezard: *He panted and leant forward.* (I'm running low of Neurons..)

Luna: *She released the string, causing a small burst of mud to blow on the Guardian's shoulder.* (No matter how hard I try, these arrows seem to be getting weaker and weaker, aye!)

Champion: *She looked at Luna, causing her to gasp in amazement.* "You've got powers too-?"

Luna: "Wat are ya talkin' about?!" *She grunted and released the string to her bow, blasting another chunk off the Guardian's shoulder.*

Guardian: *Mud continuously filled the areas it received damage.* "Why must you struggle?"

Nathan: "Air Slash."

Luna: "Harh!" *She screamed and released the string, causing an arrow-like pulse to collide into Nathan's air slash, causing a massive burst of mud to explode the Guardian's arm off.*

Guardian: "Gnoarl!?" *It watched its arm fall on to the ground, causing its shape to loosen and liquefy into a puddle of mud.*

Twortz: "Sonic Rush." *She swayed the violin across, blasting a scattered shock wave directly into the Guardian, bursting half of its side away.*

Nathan: *His hair swayed back in the direction of Twortz's shock wave.* (Whoa-?!)

Twortz: "Sonic Roar." *She screamed out an echoing vortex, suddenly blasting into the Guardian's chest, blowing a large hole in it.*

Champion: "Oh my, whoever that was, is very powerful."

Guardian: "Mud Shot." *It suddenly shot out five bullet-sized pebbles, shooting them all towards Twortz.*

Twortz: "Oh-?!" *She gasped with widening eyes.*

Trevour: "DUST STORM" *He punched his fists together, blasting a swirling vortex of dirt in front of Twortz.*

*The pebbles shot into the swirling dirt, causing them to pop out of the other side.*

Twortz: *She looked down, staring at the pebbles in shock.* (The dirt acted as a cushion-) "Much appreciated whoever you are."

Trevour: *He nodded his head in acknowledgement.* "We're not out of this yet, lady."

Guardian: "Gnarrrrroolllll!" *Its eyes shined an eerie yellow colour, causing mud to string up from the ground, slowly restoring its body.*

Luna: "No... This is bullshit.." *She spoke with lowering morale, slightly tilting the bow downwards.*

Twortz: "If only I had something to increase my speed-" *She whispered under her breath and started to play the violin, causing its sounds to echo across the battlefield.*

Karol: (Something to boost her speed?)

Rachael: *She double kicked the Guardian and jumped up, side kicking it across the side of its face.* (Tssk!)

*Rachael's foot started to sink into the Guardian's face, causing her to frown.*

Rachael: (The resistance on its body, it feels like I'm running on thick sand!-) *She pushed her feet into the Guardian's face, allowing her to spiral back.*

Trevour: (Wow, she moves like a skilled warrior!-)

Karol: "Sacred dance, Speed Up." *He tap-danced on the spot and waved his hands towards Twortz, causing a grey sigil-like glyph to form under her feet.*

Twortz: (This feeling.. I feel like I weigh nothing!-) *She jumped forward, blasting across the clearing at incredible speeds.*

*Squish-like cracking sounds echoed from Twortz's ankles, causing her to hiss in pain.*

Lezard: (Those sounds, sounds like a muscle being ripped-)

Twortz: *She awkwardly stopped in front of the Guardian and placed the violin in between her legs.* "Sacred scores, Sonic Pulsar."

*Twortz formed a triangle with her fingers and breathed into it, blasting a vortex of sound into the Guardian.*

Guardian: "Ah-?!" *Its body warped from the inside.*

Luna: (Its body looks like a bag of popcorn popping-)

Guardian: "Gnoallll!" *It burped out a different coloured mud and focused, causing its body to stabilise.*

Twortz: *She lowered her arms.* (Nothing-?)

Nathan: "It keeps recovering!" *He grunted with the sword pointing at the Guardian.*

Twortz: *She skilfully grabbed the tip of the violin and flicked it into the air, catching it in one hand.* "Sonic Rush."

*Twortz waved the violin, blowing a scattered shock wave into the Guardian's face, blowing a side of its cheek away.*

Twortz: "Hahahckee!"

Rachael: *She staggered back with her fists raised to her face, watching the Guardian heal itself.* (Dammit.)

Guardian: "A Score User, Remenistal User, Elementalist, Scoldrant User, Radiaton wielder and a dancer, this is a dangerous party-"

Trevour: "Don't forget Nathan!" *He shouted and frowned with determination, failing to notice a stream of blood which ran down his face.*

Guardian: "Ground, move to my body, move with my Astragons, quake and crack, open the natural gates of might's minerals, iron, copper, erode into my body and form the courage that rumbles in my heart-"

*Green swirls of dust ringed around the Guardian's body, slowly crystallising on to its outer mud layer.*

Twortz: (What a long incantation!-) *She started to play the violin, causing visible sound strings to swirl around her.*

Guardian: "PANTOTHENATE ARMOUR" *Its roar echoed in a different tone, as a green crystal-like armour covered its entire body.*

Nathan: *He jumped over an arm-shaped clump of mud and ran into striking distance, raising the sword.* "Double Slash."

Rachael: "Rock Pillar." *She punched towards the green-plated Guardian and a rock pillar shot up, shattering away from the Guardian.* (Crud-)

Trevour: "..." *He stood on the spot, looking at each party member in a defensive-like manner.*

Karol: *He continued to tap-dance, allowing Twortz to move at incredible speeds.* (I'm sckared.)

Luna: "Harh!" *She released the string to her bow, blasting another arrow at the Guardian.*

Champion: *She watched a blast of wind flick off the Guardian like an arrow.* (No effect-)

Rachael: *She listened to the violin sounds, drawing her attention to Twortz.* (A violin? When did she-?)

Twortz: "Hiyah!" *She swayed forward, blasting the sound strings towards the Guardian.*

Guardian: *The sound strings hit the armour, causing a foil-like warping sound to be heard.* "Gnoael."

Nathan: "It's no use!-"

Guardian: "My head!-" *It quickly flicked its arm and punched Rachael back towards Luna and the champion.*

Karol: "Waichael!-" *He squealed and stopped dancing, causing the sigil-like glyph to fade from under Twortz.*

Guardian: *It focused on Twortz and straightened an arm towards her, forming a fist.* "Die!"

Rachael: *She tumbled across the ground, kicking mud into the air.* (That hurt!-)

Lezard: "Quick healing shot, HEALING IMPLOSION" *He swayed his arms around Rachael, queuing her wounds to rapidly heal.*

Rachael: "Thanks, Lezard." *She moaned and shook her head, rolling to one side.*

Nathan: "Get out of the way!" *He shouted at Twortz in an urgent-like manner, as if he knew the next attack was going to be a critical.*

Twortz: "Sphere of Might." *She jumped on the spot and a visible sphere-like shock wave expanded from her feet.*

Guardian: "STEELIGHT RETENTION" *It punched forward and its arm snapped off, firing itself towards Twortz like a missile.*

Rachael: "Twortz!"

Twortz: "..." *She watched the missile-like arm hit the edge of her sphere shock wave, causing it to misfire to the side.*

Trevour: *He watched the arm spiral in the air and hit the ground, before tumbling into the bush.* (It sounds heavy!-)

Twortz: *She squinted her eyes, pretending not to be exhausted.* (That attack may have missed me, but, its power... I've underestimated it-)

Guardian: "You will not break through my defences!" *It gargled a roar and watched a mud-like arm swirl out of its armour, restoring its lost arm.*

Champion: "Oh my, it's too strong!"

Trevour: (Pantothenate Armour..) "In order to shatter its armour, there needs to be a simultaneous attack from its front and back."

Nathan: "How do you know-?"

Trevour: "Trust me, sir!"

Rachael: *She looked at Nathan and nodded her head, as if she could trust him.* "I don't know who you are, but he's an awesome ground Rostical User."

Nathan: *He looked at the Guardian and hesitated.* "Once we break its armour, we'll need to strike it right in the middle of its chest!"

Luna: "Nah, it's head, aye!"

Nathan: "No, its chest is its weak spot!"

Luna: "So why haven't we bloody done that already then?!"

Twortz: "You may not have noticed, but all of its movements have been defensive." *She paused and placed the dagger on the strings, readying to play her violin.*

Nathan: (That's right..) *He thought in surprise.*

Luna: "Twotters?!"

Twortz: "I can handle the back side, someone handle the front."

Lezard: "Jinkies! We'll need something strong!"

Rachael: *She had a flashback of Luna and Nathan's combination attack.* "Luna, Nathan, combine your attacks!"

Lezard: (Loona?)

Nathan: *He recalled his air slash combining with Luna's air arrow.* (Our attacks did work, but I didn't know Luna knew any-)

Champion: "I recommend you use the incantation to your attack if you know it, Luna."

Luna: "Aye?"

Champion: "Your Azure Burst."

Luna: "I don't got no Azhure Burst, aye?!"

Champion: "Oh? Then what are you firing?"

Luna: *She looked towards her hand, noticing there was nothing in her fingers.* "There's nothin'?" (I thought I felt an arrow-?)

*Luna lowered the bow and released the string, causing a small burst of mud to blast in the bow's direction.*

Luna: "Holy shit-?!"

Champion: (She is not aware of her power?)

Luna: *She looked confused and shook her head, dropping to her knees.* (Everything with this retarded vision is so disorientatin', aye.)

Champion: *She glanced at the Guardian, as if she knew Luna couldn't help.* "I have wind-based Rostical!"

Rachael: "That should work-"

Guardian: "Stop talking!" *It leant back and spat a ball of black sludge towards the champion.*

Trevour: "Miss!-" *He punched the ground, causing a swirl of sand to tilt the champion's angle.* "SWIRLING SANDPIT"

Champion: "Oh my-" *She watched the black sludge sway past her, smearing itself on the tree behind her.*

*The tree started to turn brown around the sludge, causing the champion to gasp in astonishment.*

Champion: (It's sapping the Neurons-)

Twortz: *She started to play the violin, catching Rachael's attention.* (Ever since I understood the concept of Neurons and Astragons, everything just seems so natural to me-)

Rachael: "Twortz, I thought you were going to attack it from be-?"

Twortz: *She enthusiastically played the violin, causing strings of visible sound to blast towards the Guardian.* (Now, manipulate it with Astragons! The same way I did to Millard's flames!-)

Nathan: *He watched the strings closely miss the Guardian, causing him to grunt in disgust.* (She missed, what a foolish person-)

Twortz: "Hahahackee!" *She watched the sound strings sway around the Guardian, violently hitting into its back, causing echoing violin chords to be heard.*

Trevour: (Still not strong enough-)

Rachael: "Karol, help her out!"

Karol: "O-Oh 'kay!" *He tapped the ground and started to dance, causing an orange glyph to spiral underneath Twortz.*

Twortz: *She noticed a sudden thickness to her sound strings, causing the Guardian to respond to them in a negative manner.*

Karol: "Power Up."

Rachael: "Alright, guy with the sword and lady over there!" *She glanced behind her, shouting at the champion.*

Champion: "Oh my, that's me!" *She hobbled out of the sandpit, focusing her attention to Rachael.*

Nathan: "..."

Rachael: "Use your fully strengthened attacks on the front!" *She shouted, listening to rock crack behind the Guardian.*

Luna: (What the fuck? Now I'm hearin' violins?) *She closed her eyes in disorientation, as if she didn't know what was happening.*

Champion: "O-Oh my!-" *She whimpered and hobbled to the side, dropping down to one knee.* (My Neurons?!)

Luna: (Aye?) *She looked up, staring at the champion in confusion.* (Wat's wrong with her?)

Champion: *She looked to her side, noticing a smear of black sludge on her arm.* "Oh no, the plan?"

Destiny: "Yeu, yeu, yeup!" *She meowed to Luna, as if she was telling her to get up.*

Luna: *She frowned in disorientation and slowly stood up, raising the bow to her face.* (As if I'm one of them weak assed characters, aye!)

Destiny: "Yeu, yeu!"

Trevour: *He quickly hobbled up to the champion and placed his hands over the sludge, causing it to dry out.* "There, miss-" *He brushed the dried sludge off with ease.*

Champion: "Thank you." *She looked at her arm, noticing a red mark where the sludge was.*

Lezard: "My very hunchbacked friend!"

Champion: "Oh my? Yes?!"

Lezard: "Quick internal light, INVOKING AURA" *He giggled in exhaustion, collapsing onto his side.*

*A swirl of warm light flashed around the champion's arm, very slowly healing her wounds.*

Champion: "Thank you, Radiaton User."

Luna: *She puffed out her chest and stood in a battle-ready pose, pulling on the string with uncertainty.* (I've been firin' off fake arrows..? If it was working before..)

Nathan: *He slowly inhaled and relaxed himself, as his entire body glowed a shade of blue.* "Number twenty nine, Air Slash."

*Nathan raised the sword and swayed to the side, slicing a visible air slash towards the Guardian.*

Luna: "Take this, dipshit!" *She screamed and released the string, shooting an arrow-like blast into Nathan's air slash.*

Twortz: (Come on!) *She started to play the violin at a professional level, causing Karol to squeal with each dance step.*

Karol: (Her power increased and it's hard to keep up!) *He waited for his arms to sway over his head, allowing him to quickly wipe the sweat off his face without losing dancing movement.*

Rachael: *She watched the air slash and air shot merge into one, before violently bursting through the Guardian's armour.* "Yes!-"

Twortz: "Yeeharh!" *She leant forward and watched the musical strings violently shatter the Guardian's back armour.*

Rachael: "Double yes!"

Nathan: "Now, for its weakness!"

Karol: "Ah-" *He squealed and collapsed in a spiral manner, causing the orange glyph under Twortz to shatter away.*

Twortz: *She took deep breaths, lowering the dagger and violin.* (I'm very tired-)

Rachael: "What are we going to do?"

Luna: "We don't have a super strong Rostickal attack, aye?"

Nathan: "Chur.." *He grunted in agreement.*

Guardian: "Now it is my turn to attack!-"

Champion: *She faced the Guardian and cupped her hands, forming a circle with her fingers.* "Defensive winds, swirl and soar, offensive gusts, grand rifts blow throughout my spirit-"

*The champion looked down, watching a green glyph form itself on the ground.*

Rachael: *She looked over her shoulder, noticing glyphic-like symbols materialise in the air around the champion.* "What are they?"

Trevour: "How-How temperamental..." *He spoke in shock.*

Rachael: "What is it?"

Trevour: "..."

Rachael: "Dude, what is it?"

Trevour: "Grand Rostical.."

Rachael: (Grand Rostical?!)

Champion: "Tunnel its power through the almighty clouds and pierce anything that stands in its way-" *She shouted with an echoing voice, causing the symbols and glyph to glow brighter.*

Lezard: "And as the champion steals the spotlight, the delicious party couldn't help but notice the glyphs spiral around her, they also made a chime-like noise-"

Champion: "DIVINE TORNADO" *She focused, causing the entire area to turn into darkness.*

Luna: "W-Wat the-?" *She looked around only seeing pitch black.* "What's happenin'? Has somethin' happened to my vision?!"

Rachael: "Why is it all dark?"

Twortz: "I can't see-?" *She spoke with a trembling voice and started to play the violin out of fear, randomly shooting strings of sound into the darkness.*

Nathan: "Settle down your large friend! She's wasting her Neurons!"

Twortz: "It's black! We're trapped!-"

Rachael: "Twortz!" *She blindly grabbed Twortz's arm, as she could not see her hand.*

Twortz: "H-Huh?" *She looked surprised and stopped playing the violin.*

Rachael: "It's alright-"

Twortz: "You're a fake-" *She ripped her hand out of Rachael's grip even though she couldn't see her.*

Rachael: "Hey?"

Twortz: "It's nothing.."

Champion: "Begone." *She watched a powerful tornado tightly swirl around the Guardian, bursting the ground around it.*

Karol: (Th-That powa!-) *He squealed in thought, watching the nearby mud on the ground suck into the swirling vortex.*

Nathan: (This is Rostical..) *He stepped back, keeping a safe distance to the growing tornado.*

Destiny: "Y-Yeu.."

Champion: *She turned around and waved her arm, causing the wind to die down and the area to revert back to normal.*

Luna: *She blinked several times.* (I can see again.)

Trevour: "Where did it go?" *He looked to where the Guardian was, staring at vacant space in confusion.*

Trevour: "Did you defeat it, miss?"

Twortz: "I-I don't believe it.." *She looked up with a dropping jaw.*

Rachael: "What-?" *She looked up and noticed a small shadow in the sky.* "Is that-?"

Trevour: (With the density of the Guardian's mud.. An impact from that height should-) "Unless you want to be covered in mud, get out of the way!"

Champion: *She took a deep breath and stared in front with double vision.* (That took more out of me than anticipated-) *She started to hobble out of the clearing, covering one eye in exhaustion.*

Lezard: "Every monster for themselves!" *He giggled in exhaustion and started to hobble out of the clearing.*

Nathan: "Tssk-" *He suddenly jumped to the side and ran out of the clearing, keeping his focus in the sky.*

Rachael: "Twortz-"

Twortz: "I'll be there shortly-"

Karol: "Warh-?!" *He squealed and quickly stood up, running towards Nathan.* "Oof-" *He tripped on his own foot, causing Trevour to catch him.*

Trevour: "Watch your step, little meister."

Karol: "Nee hee, fanks-"

Destiny: "Yeup!-"

Luna: "Ah-?" *She snapped out of her daze and noticed only Rachael and Twortz standing in the clearing.* "Where did everyone go?"

Destiny: "Yeup!" *She hopped on Luna's shoulder and intensely stared at Nathan in the bushes, drawing Luna's attention towards him.*

Luna: "Wha-?"

Destiny: "Yeup?!"

Luna: "Ah, OK?" *She grunted in confusion and started to run towards Nathan, causing Destiny to purr, as if Luna was doing the right thing.*

Rachael: "Twortz? We gotta go now-"

Twortz: "That power.." *She observed the swirls of mud left by the wind.* "It wasn't as strong as Millard, but-.." (I've still got a long way to go.)

Guardian: "Gnaorl..." *It gargled a moan of defeat and crashed into the ground, exploding into a pulse of mud.*

Rachael: "Ah!-. Rock Pillar." *She punched her arm upwards, causing a pillar of rock to erupt up in front of her and Twortz.*

Twortz: *She watched mud pulse on each side.* "Excuse me?" *She snapped out of her confusion and looked at Rachael.*

Rachael: "Let's go?" *She nodded her head with a smile and swayed her fist downwards, causing the pillar to burst back into the ground.*

Twortz: "You appear to be getting better at your fantasy based abilities."

Rachael: "Me? Look at you! Where did you get that violin?"

Twortz: "I'll tell you on the way, but it seems we've got several introductions to do." *She spoke in a professional-like manner and placed the violin over her shoulder, causing it to turn invisible.*

Rachael: "You've even got that ability Millard used?!"

Twortz: "..." *She cupped her hands behind her back and started to walk towards the cluttering party in the forest, smiling at Rachael in response.*

Rachael: "Yeah, Luna's here too?" *She sounded unsure.*

Twortz: (How intriguing? She wasn't even on the roof when we suddenly got transported here.)

----------

*Blake walked across a stone room, deep inside Sorrowprax, placing both hands around an armour-like helmet.*

Blake: *He reached up, gently placing the helmet over his head.* (As leader of The Black Brigade, I don't often get the sexy duties of hunting people down, but...)

*Blake placed his hand on a glyph on the wall, causing thick metal doors to slide open.*

Blake: (If I can't like go myself, then..)

*Blake hissed with a chuckle and started to walk down a stone corridor, listening to warrior-like grunts in the background.*

Blake: (Zazark.. He's like a mixture between me and Tara.. He'll get the job done, fufufufu.)

----------

*A dark figure sped through a forest, causing the branches to violently sway behind it.*

Zazark: *He ran through the bright forest at blinding speeds, watching the area blur past him.* (Despite Tara's seal, people were able to defeat her without major injury.. I can't wait to find them.)

*Zazark smirked in thought and looked over his shoulder, watching his straight black, porcupine-like hair sway in one cluster behind him.*

Zazark: (Report's log says, they're heading in this direction-) *He grunted in determination and swayed to each side, skilfully dodging tree-like blurs.*

----------

*Lezard, Karol, Nathan, Luna, Destiny, Trevour and the champion gathered in another clearing just outside the forest.*

Champion: (We made it out.) *She placed her hands on her knees, as if the weight of her hunchback was causing her grief.*

Karol: *He slowly walked towards a ledge and noticed a massive drop, leading to a magnificent ocean.* (There's no sand.. It's just a cliff.)

Luna: *She smelt salt in the cool breeze, as she listened to the waves crash in the distance.* (It went all black and I couldn't see anythin'..) *She recalled the time the champion used her Grand Rostical.*

Nathan: *He wiped the sword on his leg, trying to get any mud remains off.* (This disease even affects Guardian's now? What's next? The Consultants themselves?)

Lezard: *He heard bristling noises, causing him to turn around.* "Flaming fish-cakes! The mud Guardian is back!" *He squealed, causing Karol to squeal in response.*

Nathan: *He turned around and sighed, watching Lezard eagerly point at Twortz.* "..."

Lezard: "Oh, it's just you. Was hard to tell-" *He watched Rachael and Twortz walk out of the forest.*

Twortz: "Your humour is impeccable." *She spoke in a condescending manner, flicking clumps of mud off her arm.*

Trevour: "The situation was a little unyielding to us, wasn't it? Heh heh."

Twortz: "A warrior? Aren't you meant to be bad?" *She placed her hand over her shoulder, readying to release her weapon.*

Lezard: "I know!-" *He sounded cautious.*

Trevour: "I-I am, but I mean no harm." *He raised his hands, symbolising his honesty.*

Lezard: "What a plot twist! Ooo." *He sarcastically wiggled his bottom to each side.*

Luna: "Who the fuck's this retard?" *She hissed in disgust at Lezard.*

Lezard: "Oh...?"

Rachael: "He's cool."

Luna: "Aha, doesn't look like it."

Champion: "Oh my-" *She hobbled forward, glancing at Rachael, Twortz and Lezard.* "I go by the name champion. What are your names? I must personally thank you for your efforts back there."

Rachael: "That Grand Rostical.. You're really strong."

Champion: "Oh my, me? I just know a few Rostical here and there." *She spoke in a high innocent-like tone, smiling with her eyes closed.*

Nathan: "..."

Lezard: "Well, I'm Lezard, you may call me your majesty."

Luna: "Wut?" *She spoke in an unimpressed-like manner, causing Rachael to smile.*

Rachael: "Luna-" *She walked up to Luna and gave her a hug.*

Luna: "Gah, get it off me!"

Rachael: "Hehe, how are you here?"

Twortz: "Indeed. How exactly are you here if you were not present in my store?" (Does this mean people from other places in Dee Highs were transported too-?)

Luna: "Nah, you left the back door open, aye."

Twortz: "So, you trespassed?!"

Luna: "Ye." *She spoke as if she didn't care.*

Nathan: "Just reminding everyone, we still have to go to Silver Wind Island."

Lezard: "Ooo!-" *He giggled in a sarcastic-like manner, glancing at Nathan.* "That's where our delicious adventure is currently taking us!"

Luna: "Seriously?"

*A ray of light blasted down from the sky, landing in a forest in the very far distance.*

Lezard: "What was that?"

Rachael: "A shooting star?"

Champion: "It's been great meeting you all."

Lezard: "But we didn't even get to introduce our-?!"

Rachael: "My name is Rachael, but you can call me Rach."

Twortz: "I am Twortz, a pleasure." *She slightly bowed in a professional-like manner.*

Nathan: "Nathan."

Luna: "Luna." *She grunted and pretended to be Nathan, causing Karol to giggle.*

Karol: "I'm Karol, with a kay."

Luna: "Naww-"

Trevour: "Trevour, also a pleasure to meet your acquaintance."

Champion: *She smiled at Karol, Rachael, Lezard and Twortz before turning around.* "I will definitely see you again, my friends."

Lezard: "I hardly know you, but I'll miss you forever!" *He pretended to speak from his heart, as he waved his hands over his head.*

Champion: (Until next time-) *She smiled and stepped into a hidden Spacial Funnel, causing her body to warp and disappear before the party's eyes.*

Trevour: (There was a Spacial Funnel right there?)

Luna: "Where did ya find this one?" *She snarled at Lezard, rolling her eyes.*

Nathan: "Talk and walk." *He mumbled and started to walk along the cliff, purposely avoiding the forest.*

Lezard: "How old are you, little one?"

Karol: "Uhm-, this many!" *He straightened his arms at Lezard, holding up seven fingers.*

Lezard: "Seven, jinkies."

Luna: "Wat are ya doin' with a child, Rachael?"

Twortz: "Do not get me started."

Trevour: *He looked at Twortz, observing the area around her back.* "I couldn't help but notice, madam?"

Twortz: *She looked at Trevour and frowned, as if she was insulted he forgot her name.* "Twortz-"

Trevour: "Oh, I remember that, heh heh. It's just what I call people-"

Twortz: "Perhaps start with their name? That's why we have names, no?"

Trevour: "Ah, yes, you're right, madam-"

Twortz: "Excuse me?"

Trevour: "I mean, Twortz."

Twortz: *She followed Nathan, cupping her hands behind her back.* "Where are we going?"

Nathan: *He placed his hands on his head and focused his attention ahead.* "We just follow this ridge West and we'll eventually get there."

Trevour: (I never got to ask my question-) *He quickly hobbled up to Twortz, looking at her in curiosity.* "Your musical instrument, it's a very unique weapon."

Twortz: "Indeed." *She spoke with closure, as if she ended the conversation.*

Trevour: "Heh heh.. I better leave you to it then." *He awkwardly chuckled and focused his attention to Lezard and Karol.*

Twortz: *She glanced at Trevour, observing his armour.* "You're a warrior-"

Trevour: "I used to be." *He hobbled by Twortz's side, ignoring his rattling armour.*

Twortz: "Were you a captain?"

Trevour: "Me? Oh no, heh heh. Captains usually wear platinum armour, not black or grey."

Twortz: "How do you become a captain?"

Trevour: "By rising up the ranks."

Twortz: "What if someone was really powerful, would they take over another captain?"

Trevour: "What do you mean?"

Twortz: "Well, bumping them out of captain ranking."

Trevour: "That's not possible."

Twortz: "That's it? Not possible at all?"

Trevour: "Well-" *He looked up in thought.* "Perhaps if the Consultant issued some sort of ranking change, it just doesn't happen."

Twortz: "So, the person just sits at vice captain level?"

Trevour: *He paused and tilted his head to the side.* "Well.."

Twortz: "Well, what?"

Trevour: "You could always challenge a captain."

Twortz: "And take their ranking?"

Trevour: "In a sense."

Twortz: "I'm not a person that likes to talk around the bush. Tell me straight up please."

Trevour: "Well, if you fight a captain to the death, you'll take their ranking that way."

Twortz: "I see."

Trevour: "Why? What is with these unusual questions? Are you planning to fight a captain?"

Twortz: "Hahackee, no. I was curious."

Trevour: "Heh heh, that's good. You'd need to be way stronger than you are now to even fight in a captain levelled battle."

Twortz: "I see." *She fake smiled, causing Trevour to chuckle more comfortably.*

Luna: *She walked closer to Rachael.* "So, got any burgers for me? I'm starvin', aye."

Rachael: "Hehe, no I-" *She gasped, staring at Luna's eyes.* "W-What happened?"

Luna: "Ah, I fought a few dragons and this was the scar left behind." *She sniffed her finger, pretending to be cool.*

Rachael: "Dragons? You mean Scoldrants?"

Destiny: "Yeup!" *She hopped on top of Luna's head, catching Rachael's attention.*

Rachael: "How can you see? Are your wounds just worse than they appear?"

Luna: "Ya don't even care about Destiny?"

Destiny: "Yeup?" *Her fur drooped, implying she was feeling down.*

Rachael: "Well.. I'm currently more concerned about your eyes."

Luna: "Aha, thanks, I'm blushin'."

Rachael: "So, about your eyes.."

Luna: "You mentioned Scoldrant.. Guess you're up to date with things in this world too, aye?"

Rachael: "Yeah, seems so."

Luna: "And I got attacked by some warrior slut, and yea.."

Rachael: "And-?"

Luna: "I can see through Destiny's eyes."

Rachael: "Destiny? Is that the Scoldrant's name?"

Luna: "Yea."

Rachael: *She looked at Karol and Lezard's back.* "Lezard-"

Lezard: "Hello, Razzypoo."

Rachael: "Could you please heal Luna's eyes?"

Lezard: "I'll be happy to, after a quick rest." *He pouted in an apologetic-like manner.*

Luna: "How can that gay guy heal?"

Rachael: "Luna-"

Lezard: "Happy? Yeah, I'm happy, bwarharh." *He chuckled at Luna, oblivious to her ill-mannered question.*

Nathan: *He walked into a dirt clearing and stopped, staring at an island out in the ocean.* "..."

Twortz: "Why have you stopped here?"

Trevour: "Sir?"

Nathan: "We're here." *He stared at the island, watching waves violently crash around it.*

*Lezard, Karol, Rachael, Luna and Destiny stood around Nathan, staring at the island in confusion.*

Luna: "Pssht! It's just an island?"

Destiny: "Yeu..?"

Twortz: "This hardly looks like a city to me."

Rachael: "The biggest city in the world couldn't possibly fit on that island."

Karol: "Spaycial Funnel?"

Lezard: "Correct, my little one."

Nathan: "There's a problem.."

Trevour: "A problem, sir?"

Nathan: "I don't have my entry's pass.."

Rachael: "What's that?"

Trevour: "It's an item that activates the Silver Triplets."

Luna: "Aye?"

Trevour: "They're the city's ultimate defence."

*A metallic-like object drifted in the air, catching the party's attention.*

Lezard: (Speaking of the devil.) *He giggled to himself in thought.*

Luna: "A floatin' piece of metal?"

Rachael: "That's what you don't see in this world! Litter!"

Twortz: "Indeed. It's much cleaner here-"

Nathan: "World?"

Rachael: *She looked at Nathan.* "I mean-"

Luna: "It's kool. We all know we're not from around here, aye?"

Twortz: (That is such a Lighten thing to do. Too bad if that was meant to be a secret-)

Lezard: "Ooo, my delicious strangers."

Twortz: "I highly advise you to not eagerly give away such information, Luna."

Luna: "But you lot seemed all friendly and stuff, I just thought-"

Twortz: *She shook her head, causing Luna to stop talking.* (I'm tired of these repetitive conversations. They can discuss them when I'm not here.)

Luna: (Bitch.)

Destiny: "Yeup."

Twortz: *She focused her attention back to the metallic object.* "What actually is that?"

Trevour: "A Silver Triplet."

Rachael: "Besides its colour, why is it called that?"

Lezard: "That's because-"

*The Silver Triplet tilted its angle and reflected the sun's light, causing a blinding light to shine in the party's faces.*

Rachael: "Bright!-" *She squinted her eyes and looked away.*

Trevour: *He covered his face, patiently waiting for something to happen.* "Almost-"

*The Silver Triplet continued its slow spiral and tilted angle again, causing the light to shine on the ocean.*

Karol: "W-Wow-" *He blinked and rubbed his eyes like a child.*

Nathan: "They're called Triplets because they have the ability to reflect any type of Astragons."

Trevour: "Which from a distance, gives the illusion there's more than one."

Twortz: "But that was light, not Astragons."

Lezard: "Astragons and Neurons flow through any and everything in this world, including light itself."

Twortz: "So, you could manipulate light?"

Lezard: "I suppose.. Only to an extent of course-"

Trevour: "It's thanks to those Rosterology items, we've been unable to take over Silver Wind Island."

Twortz: "Rosterology items?"

Trevour: "They are Rostical based devices."

Twortz: *She had a flashback of the door spiralling open in front of her.* (So, is that what they call technology over here?)

Rachael: "When you say, unable to take over. You mean, the warriors?"

Trevour: "Yes, madam."

Nathan: "But Silver Triplets aren't Rosterology items."

Trevour: "They're not, sir?"

Nathan: "They're Ancioldrants."

Luna: "Wow, more new stuff to wrap your head around, aye." *She grunted in frustration.*

Rachael: "Hehe, you're better than Lance.. He'd just blatantly ignore stuff that's vital to know."

Luna: "Aha, true. You know him quite well?"

Rachael: "Because of Ashton."

Luna: "Ah-"

Twortz: (Ignore stuff that's vital? The irony..) "What are Ancioldrants?"

Nathan: (I must've forgotten what they were for a moment-) *He rubbed his head in disorientation.* "They're Scoldrants that come from ancient times."

Luna: "Am I the only one picturin' mummies in pyramids?"

Nathan: "Or, it's the highest level a Scoldrant can reach."

Trevour: "The highest level?" *He pointed over his shoulder.* "We just fought a Guardian-"

Nathan: *He shook his head in response.* "Ancioldrants are higher ranked."

Trevour: "Even the Guardians themselves?"

Nathan: *He nodded his head.* "Even the Guardians themselves."

Trevour: "Unfathomable."

Luna: "More like, bullshit."

Twortz: (So, there're creatures even stronger than the one we just fought?) *She intensely stared at the ground.* (We almost died back there..)

Rachael: *She nodded her head to the island.* "What's the deal with the island?"

Nathan: *He shook his head in defeat.* "We could wait until-"

Lezard: "Luckily for everyone, Lezard once again saves the day, bwarharh." *He hobbled up to Nathan and slowly raised his hand, revealing a silver pearl.*

Nathan: "Don't tell me, that's-?"

Lezard: "A key to enter the island?" *He watched the island warp in response and a tornado-like swirl of Silver Triplets formed around the island.*

Trevour: "Wow-"

Luna: "There's like, hundreds of 'em!"

Destiny: "Yeu, yeup."

Karol: "H-How did they shuddenly uppear?"

Rachael: "A Spacial Funnel?"

Lezard: "Maybe closer to a Reality Marble?"

Twortz: "You sound unsure."

Lezard: "Holy fish-cakes, I don't know the answer to everything."

Luna: *She chuckled at the Silver Triplets.* "That's a kool defence as it is."

Trevour: "The Silver Triplets?"

Luna: "Nah, having the image of a boring island. Nobody would have two thoughts of inspectin' it."

Nathan: "Yeah."

Karol: (I've never been this far out from the citee before.. I'm so eggsited!) *He smiled in thought and staggered closer to Rachael for comfort.*

Lezard: *He concentrated, causing silver glyphs to spiral around the pearl.* (Here's the tricky bit, trying to stabilise the Astragons-)

*A transparent blue aura path suddenly shot from the island and connected into cliff in front of the party, effectively creating a bridge from one to the other.*

Lezard: *He smiled and lowered his arm, hobbling towards the edge of the cliff.* "Off we go, children."

Luna: "Ahh.. That won't hold all of us, would it?"

Lezard: "Sure it will!" *He purposely took a large step onto the path and looked down, watching the waves crash underneath.*

Trevour: "How riveting." *He spoke with excitement, eagerly walking towards Lezard.*

Luna: "Why you so excited?"

Trevour: "I've never been into the actual city."

Luna: "Aye?"

Trevour: "It's because-" *He looked down, staring at his armour.* "Us warriors are not allowed to enter the city."

Twortz: "Never?"

Trevour: "Only under certain circumstances."

Nathan: *He walked down the aura made path and stopped, glancing behind him at the party.* "Quit your dawdling."

Luna: "Quit ya dawdlin'." *She grunted like an idiot.*

Nathan: "Mature.." *He grumbled under his breath and continued to follow Lezard down the path.*

Karol: *He stopped at the cliff and looked down, causing him to squirm back in fear.* "I-I kan't-"

Rachael: *She watched Karol stagger back into her arms, causing her to place her hands on his shoulders.* "It's fine. You can hold my hand if you want?"

Karol: "N-No, I dohn't want!-" *He paused in mid-sentence.*

Twortz: *She watched Lezard, Nathan and Trevour walk down the path towards the swirling tornado of Silver Triplets.* "Then leave the child here and be on our way."

Luna: "Aha, wut?" *She chuckled with a serious question.*

Karol: "Weave me?"

Twortz: "..." *She stepped over the ledge and hesitantly placed her foot on the aura, as if she was inspecting its integrity.* (It feels like concrete.)

Karol: *He pouted his lips, frowning at Twortz.* "...-"

Rachael: "I can stay here with you, Karol."

Karol: "Y-Yoo dohn't have-"

Rachael: "You're my responsibility. I won't force you to do anything you're not comfortable with-"

Luna: "Ya know, he's a kid, aye, not some noble prince.." *She grunted on her breath and awkwardly walked towards the aura path, suddenly stopping in shock.*

Rachael: (She does have a point. Maybe if I encourage him-)

Karol: "I whant to go-" *He quickly held Rachael's hand and walked towards the path, noticing Luna standing in the way.*

Rachael: "Luna?"

Luna: "..."

Rachael: "Do you need help?"

Luna: "Nah-" *She sniffed and pretended to be cool, taking a large step forward.* "Wha-?!"

Destiny: "Yeup?!" *She quickly hopped off Luna's shoulder.*

Karol: "Loonarh?!" *He squealed in fright.*

Rachael: "Rock Pillar." *She let go of Karol's hand and jumped forward, punching upwards in an arch-like manner.*

*A rock pillar suddenly shot out of the cliff and caught Luna, as she stepped off the cliff instead of on the aura path.*

Rachael: "Phew..."

Luna: *She gasped in terror, placing all fours of the pillar Rachael created.* "I-I fucking missed?"

Rachael: "It doesn't make you any weaker to ask for help." *She spoke in a mature manner and walked over to the ledge, dropping to her knees.*

Destiny: "Yeu..." *She meowed, as if she was concerned.*

Rachael: *She tapped Luna's shoulder which caught her attention.* "And watch your language." *She pulled Luna back up onto the land and stood up straight.*

Karol: (She's amazing.. She whon't let anyfing bad happen to me.)

Luna: "My eyes.." *She observed the aura path, only seeing two faint lines from her sketch-like vision.* "I don't think I should cross this path by myself, aye."

Rachael: "Alright, you two."

Destiny: "Yeup." *She hopped back onto Luna's shoulder.*

Rachael: "You three, let's go." *She looked down the aura path, noticing the party clutter at the silver tornado.* "They're already there."

Luna: "Glad to see you got my back, aye." *She hissed at Destiny, causing her to purr in a sorrowful-like manner.*

Twortz: *She looked up, listening to the swirling motion the Silver Triplets made.* "What happens next?"

Trevour: *He took several steps closer to the Silver Triplets, alerting Lezard.* "Wow-"

Lezard: "Be careful, tinamotto!"

Twortz: (Tinamotto?)

Trevour: "W-What is it, sir?"

Lezard: "They've been cases of the wind blowing the Silver Triplets the wrong way, effectively slicing travellers off the path."

Trevour: "Roger!" *He spoke in understanding, carefully shuffling back.*

Nathan: (The highly condensed Astragons around them create an invisible blade-)

Lezard: "It's Lezard Esteed, allow me to enter!" *His voice caused the wind to noticeably change direction.*

Twortz: "Who are you talking to-?"

Nathan: *He watched the Silver Triplets move on their own accord, revealing a door sized entrance.* "It's just a stone wall?"

Lezard: "It's similar to Surpreon, if anyone's been there." *He giggled and stepped through the stone wall, causing it to ripple like water around him.*

Twortz: *He discreetly grunted with widening eyes.* (He walked through a solid wall?!)

Rachael: "Did he just-?" *She spoke in shock, as she stopped behind Twortz with Karol, Luna and Destiny.*

Twortz: "Indeed." *She prematurely answered Rachael's question, knowing what it would be.*

Nathan: *He placed one hand on the sword and adjusted it, ensuring it was in its sheathe correctly.* "It'll be busy in there, so don't make a fuss." *He mumbled and took a deep breath, before walking into the stone wall.*

Trevour: "Alright, I'll see you all on the other side, heh heh." *He chuckled and hobbled forward, causing the sounds of his rattling armour to fade with his image.*

Twortz: "We might finally get answers."

Luna: "'Bout findin' a way home?"

Rachael: "That's exactly right."

Luna: "Kool." *She spoke with growing hope, causing Destiny to purr in happiness.*

Karol: "So, you're from their werld tooh?"

Luna: "Obvi."

Twortz: "Enough chitchat." *She waddled forward and stepped through the solid wall, causing the rest of the party to follow.*

Rachael: (Here goes nothing-) *She nervously thought to herself and stepped forward, watching a bright light flash in her face.*

Chapter 8: Silver Wind Island


Rachael: *She stepped forward, blinking in disorientation.* "Are we-?" *She suddenly heard the lively sounds of a peaceful busy city.* (Sounds.. All around me-)

Lezard: "Welcome to-" *He faced the perplexed party and spread his arms with a widening smile.* "Silver Wind Island."

Trevour: *He looked down and stared at a dark brown stone ground with a contrasting colour.* "Is this a path or a road?"

Lezard: "Or perhaps a path acting as a road? Bwarharh."

*Groups of people walked up and down the large road-like path, causing Destiny to meow in an overwhelmed manner.*

Luna: "I know, girl. Too many people, aye." *She grunted on her breath, brushing her fingers through Destiny's fur.*

Rachael: *She looked up, noticing wooden and metallic bridges connecting one side of the upper level to the other.* "There's an upper level?"

Twortz: "There's another down here?" *She looked to the far left and stared at a set of stairs which led down to another enormous level of the city.*

Trevour: "It could be very easy to get lost in here, heh heh."

Karol: "This is just as bersy as my citee."

Rachael: "Busy."

Karol: "Bursy."

*Several ladies holding old-fashioned umbrellas bumped into Luna, causing her to frown in annoyance.*

Luna: "Watch it-" *She glared at the women, causing them to giggle in disgust.*

Destiny: "Hrrrrkst." *She hissed at the women for support.*

Nathan: "..." *He discreetly smirked at Luna, as if he respected the way she stuck up for herself.*

Lezard: "There're three levels of the city-" *He stepped to each side and observed different parts of the city, allowing the party to recognise them.*

Twortz: "Explain?"

Lezard: "The lower level is the industrial side of the city. It has workshops, marts, crafting workshops and the like."

Twortz: (Fascinating. I wonder what their trade market looks like.)

Trevour: *He looked past Lezard, noticing several booths containing fruit and loaves of bread.* "This level looks like the food markets-"

Nathan: *His stomach rumbled, causing him to look away.* (Now, I just gotta go to the castle and get some answers for Luna.)

Rachael: "And up there?" *She pointed up, watching people walk across the bridges.*

Lezard: "If memory serves me right, it should be the entertainment section."

Karol: "Like what?"

Lezard: "Nothing a youngster like you should have to worry about."

Karol: "B-But I'ma man."

Nathan: "Hmph." *He chuckled at Karol and started to walk down, staring at a large castle in the distance.*

Karol: "Neh?" *He looked confused, watching Nathan walk away.*

Rachael: "What's down there?"

Luna: *She looked down the road-like path with magnified vision, noticing the castle.* "It's a castle?"

Trevour: "And that must be the royal castle, home to Grey the fourth."

Lezard: "Bingo!"

Twortz: "This part of the city almost feels like another town."

Rachael: "Yeah." *She walked down the road-like path and glanced to each side, watching people sell foreign appearing foods to the citizens.*

Nathan: *His stomach growled again.* (Once I know she's safe, I'll do some quests in The Guild's Tavern and score myself a feast.)

Lezard: *He looked at Trevour and handed him several gold pebbles.* "Be a chubby muffin and collect us some crunchables?"

Trevour: "What, sir?"

Lezard: "You know, some yum-yums?" *He rubbed his belly as he titled his head to the closest food stand.*

Trevour: "Roger! Understood." *He unintentionally spoke in a military-like manner and tightened his grip around the pebbles, proudly walking towards the food stand.*

*Two men in racer-like tights caught Rachael's attention, as they power walked towards her.*

Rachael: *She watched the men closely avoid the nearby people and passed Rachael, allowing her to notice their excitement.*

Rachael: *She watched the men power walk past her, allowing her to notice their excitement.* (Is there a marathon coming up-?)

Man A: "The Agoura Marbles starts tomorrow."

Man B: "I'm very excited."

Man A: "I'm even more excited, now that we have an actual chance of winning."

Man B: "Na, that Rostical User always wins."

Man A: *He smirked, closely avoiding the passing citizens.* "The one with the water affinity that can manipulate the water in the blood?"

Man B: "Ye."

Man A: "Unfortunately, that person was killed by an accidental Scoldrant attack."

Man B: "R-Really?" *He gasped in disbelief, as he walked out of Rachael's sight.*

Rachael: "Lezard-"

Lezard: "Yes, my grillicious meat patty?"

Luna: "Pssht, wat the-?!" *She hissed in disgust.*

Twortz: "You either get used to it, or it doesn't bother you anymore." *She spoke on her breath, discreetly glancing at Lezard.*

Rachael: "What is the.. Agoura Marbles?"

Nathan: "The Agoura Marbles, it's one of the most famous sports across the two continents."

Karol: *He nodded his head.* "Several dancers participated in the gaimes."

Rachael: (Even Karol has heard of it-) "Could you tell me more about it please?"

Nathan: "It's a race."

Twortz: (How boring..)

Luna: "I'm pretty keen."

Rachael: "Those guys said there's a game tomorrow."

Nathan: "It wouldn't hurt to ask while we're there."

Lezard: "I'll cheer my besties on!" *He jumped up, pretending her was a cheerleader.*

Trevour: "Heh heh, I'd do my best to support my friends too." *He walked up to the party with a smile, holding ten kebab-like sticks in between each of his fingers.*

Karol: "Yhummie!"

Luna: *Her stomach growled.* "Wicked! Guess you ain't a complete loser after all." *She smirked and picked two kebabs.*

Trevour: "I could be your loser."

Luna: "Umm, no." *She purposely chomped on the kebab like a pig, causing Trevour to pull an awkward disgusted face.*

Nathan: "Much appreciated, bro."

Lezard: "Bro? Ooo! Could I be your bro too?!"

Nathan: "..." *He pinched a meat chunk with his teeth and slid it off the stick while staring at Lezard with an emotionless face.*

Lezard: "Okies, rain check on that, bwarharh."

Nathan: "...-"

Luna: "Oi, more about this race, aye!"

Destiny: "Reurp-" *She meowed in agreement, as she nibbled on the spare kebab in Luna's hand.*

Trevour: "It has to be more than a race-"

Twortz: *She chewed on her kebab, focusing her attention on to Trevour.* "Why do you say it like that?"

Trevour: *He handed the last kebab to Karol and leant back up, causing his armour to rattle.* "There have been times where even captain classed warriors were hired to attend the games."

Rachael: "Why?"

Trevour: "I'm not entirely sure, madam. Maybe for security?" *He shrugged his shoulders and walked down the road-like path with the party.*

Nathan: "From experience, some captains were hired for security, and the others for the match confrontations."

Rachael: "Confrontations?"

Nathan: "More like obstacles."

Lezard: *He heard the sounds of flapping material, drawing his attention to several flags which were stationed on the castle.* "Contestants are permitted to use Remenistal on other players-"

Nathan: "The last two to reach the end, fight. I like that part, it reminds me of Battling Oxident."

Twortz: "What do you get as the reward?"

Lezard: "Not that I hope you'll be entering-" *He looked up and down, as if he was judging Twortz's physique.*

Twortz: "Excuse me-?"

Lezard: "But it's a Purifying Oxident." *He purposely ignored Twortz, answering Rachael's question with a smile.*

Twortz: (Pathetically immature.)

Rachael: "What's that?"

Luna: "It obvi purifies somethin'." *She spoke with her mouth full.*

Trevour: "I'm not entirely sure what its properties are."

Lezard: "The Rosterology artefact is said to boosts one's Neurons and Astragons, also increasing longevity."

Rachael: "Totally cool. I want one." *She formed a fist, as if she was determined to win.*

Nathan: *He stopped and stood on grass, staring at the different coloured flags.* "We're here."

Luna: "Wat's on the flags? I can't see them properly."

Lezard: "They're the Remenistal glyphs of wind and water."

Rachael: "Why?"

Lezard: "I'm not too sure. It might have something to do with the royal bloodline?"

Twortz: "It is refreshing that you haven't described the area in a while-"

Lezard: *He quickly observed the castle and its surroundings.* "The delicious stone walls of the magnificent castle were slightly grey, eww, and so were large wooden pedestals, which circled around the exterior."

Trevour: "Heh heh." (What a very distinctive personality.)

Nathan: *He walked across the grass, making his way to the castle's large front doors.* "Huh?" *He stopped and noticed there was no handle on the door, causing him to touch it in confusion.*

Karol: "What's rr-wong?"

Nathan: "What's wrong, boy? I can't open the door-"

Lezard: "Here we go-" *He raised the pearl, causing the door to ripple like water.* "Now it's open."

Twortz: (The same pearl he used to access the transparent bridge.)

Nathan: *He touched the door, noticing his hand go through it.* "It's safe-" *He mumbled in a deep voice and stepped forward, entering the castle.*

Trevour: *He stepped to the side, waving his hand towards the door.* "Ladies and gentlemen."

Luna: "Pssht-" *She rolled her eyes and strutted forward, stepping into the castle.*

Twortz: "Unlike her, I appreciate respect. Thank you, Trevor?"

Trevour: "Trevour."

Twortz: "My apologies." *She nodded her head and walked through the castle doors.*

Rachael: "Thanks."

Karol: "Fanks."

Lezard: *He looked at Trevour and giggled.* "Let's go together, so there is no last person to enter."

Trevour: "Heh heh, okay."

Nathan: *He took several steps forward and shivered, noticing he stood in the middle of a long hallway.* "It's cold."

Rachael: "It is a little chilly." *She noticed a long, thin red carpet which travelled down the hallway and up a set of white stairs.*

Luna: (I actually like the cold.) *She smirked and observed the castle's pale interior.*

Twortz: (It's almost like it's air conditioned.)

Lezard: "Excuse me, Twortzamotto?"

Twortz: "... Yes?" *She spoke on her breath.*

Lezard: "Rooms without doors could be seen down the hallway on opposite sides-"

Twortz: "Okay."

Nathan: "I'm not really sure where to go now-"

Lezard: "Upstairs, everyone." *He purposely walked on the red thin carpet and turned right, hobbling up the stairs.* "Watch your step, these stairs zigzag up to each level."

Rachael: *She jogged up the stairs, running her hand along the white rail.* "What were the rooms?"

Lezard: "At the end of the hallway is the kitchen and a place to get rations."

Trevour: *He glanced down the hallway before walking up the stairs.* (He's obviously been here before.)

Rachael: "Where exactly is this racing course?"

Trevour: "Good question, madam."

Nathan: "In The Hall of Oats."

Lezard: "It's an amazingly sensational Reality Marble."

Rachael: "But where?"

Luna: "Yea, I didn't see no racin' lap."

Destiny: "Yeup."

Nathan: "It's up on the third level, you could say there're four levels of the city. The Hall of Oats has its own level."

Rachael: (After we speak to who's in charge, I want to take a look around there-)

Lezard: "And floor number two!" *He giggled and hobbled around, facing the party with a childish smirk.*

Karol: "And-And, and.. What's this lehvel?"

Lezard: "This one, my little monster, is the city's Inn."

Twortz: "Rest?" *She panted behind the party, struggling to walk up any more steps.*

Nathan: "Unhealthy?"

Twortz: "No, I'm healthy. It's possible to be large and be healthy at the same time." *She spoke in a stern voice, emphasising her annoyance on the subject.*

Luna: (Damn, I'm nearly outta breath like Twortz..) *She tried not to breathe through her mouth.*

Rachael: "And the next floor?" *She jogged up the next set of stairs, causing Luna, Twortz and Karol to sigh in defeat.*

Lezard: "Well-"

Rachael: *She jogged onto the next level and noticed the hallway was much wider than the rest.* "This floor has vending machines?"

Lezard: *He hobbled behind Rachael and nodded his head.* "This is the research area."

Rachael: "The research area?"

Lezard: "If we're lucky enough to view their database, this is the floor we'll be using most. It has access to their detectors, researcher's logs, and the access to The Library's archives."

Rachael: (Like a computer room?) *She watched the party gather across the hallway.*

Twortz: "Made it." *She whispered to herself, taking a deep breath.*

Rachael: *She focused her attention to the stairs, looking up in curiosity.* "And the next level?"

Twortz: "The next?" *She whimpered, wiping sweat off her forehead.*

Luna: (Man, it's cold and I'm still sweatin' too. Not as hungrily as Twotters over there, but still-)

Lezard: "Up there is Grey's throne room."

Luna: "That's some leader, right?"

Nathan: "That's the fella I'm taking you to."

Trevour: "If we're seeing the ruler, perhaps I should wait outside?" *He glanced at his warrior's armour.*

Lezard: "Don't be a silly sausage. I know the ruler, I'll let him know you aren't a villain."

Trevour: "Maybe I could be?"

Luna: "Aha, you ain't no villain." *She chuckled, causing Trevour to sigh.*

Trevour: "..."

Rachael: "Alright, who's keen for some answers?" *She smiled and jogged up the next set of stairs, causing Lezard to quickly follow.*

Luna: *She stared at Nathan.* "..."

Nathan: *He made eye contact with Luna, causing her to look away.* (Weird.) *He unintentionally smiled to himself and started to jog up the stairs.*

Trevour: "Madam?" *He looked at Luna.* "You look all flustered."

Luna: "M-Me flustered?" *She spoke out of character and shyly ran up the stairs, avoiding eye contact with Trevour.*

Trevour: (Maybe I was wrong?) *He watched Luna jog up the stairs with ease.* (She's almost as energetic as that Rachael lady.)

Rachael: *She jogged onto the next floor, noticing the hallway was slightly dimmer than the rest.* (It's more quiet up here too-)

*Rachael looked down to her feet, noticing the light shine off the polished floors.*

Lezard: "And this is the level to the royal chambers-" *He sarcastically spoke under his breath to hide his exhaustion from trying to keep up with Rachael.*

Rachael: *She looked down the hallway and noticed a circle shaped room, containing enormous wooden doors.* "Down there?"

Lezard: "Yuppers-" *He sniffed, placing a hand on his waist.*

*The party gathered behind Lezard, causing Rachael to walk down the hallway.*

Twortz: "Will we be able to see the ruler so easily?" *She sounded unconvinced.*

Lezard: "Actually no-"

Rachael: *She walked into the middle of the circular room, observing the area around her.* (This place feels like it's more expensive than the rest-)

*The polished floors shined in the light, several cases overfilled with thick books stacked against the spotless wall in between the wooden pillars.*

Rachael: (I guess the royal room is behind the doors?)

*The pillars were carved with fancy royal-like patterns and a massive door similar to the pillar's design was firmly built.*

Lezard: *He hobbled behind Rachael, followed by the party.* "Razzypoo admired the sparkling polished floors and several cases of books, which stacked against the wall in between the wooden pillars."

Twortz: "Do you need to do that?"

Lezard: "Yuppers."

Rachael: *She stared at royal appearing wooden pillars, admiring their detailed carvings.*"These pillars, it's like they're telling a story."

?????: "That's because they do tell a story."

*A man's voice echoed from behind the wooden door, instantly catching the party's attention.*

Nathan: "Who's there?" *He shouted and faced the door, standing in a battle-ready pose.*

Lezard: (That voice sounds familiar.)

?????: "Who's there? That is my question."

*A mature man dressed in imperial-like armour proudly opened the doors with both arms, stepping in front of the party.*

Karol: (He's sckary looking.) *He shuffled behind Rachael, glancing at the man.*

Nathan: "You must be, Grey?"

?????: "Do you think the ruler will just randomly show up at every unannounced visit he gets?" *He adjusted an imperial helmet on the side of his head.*

Lezard: "It's a pleasure, Ordin." *He giggled and slightly bowed down to one knee.*

Ordin: "You know of me?"

Lezard: "Who wouldn't?"

Nathan: (Ordin? The ruler's right-hand man, second in charge of the city.. One of the best swordsman of this generation-) "Please forgive my disrespect!-" *He dropped to his knees, giving a sense of respect.*

Ordin: "If it isn't Lezardestel."

Lezard: "Holy fish-cakes, you remember me?"

Ordin: "Millardestel, who could forget him." *He spoke with a smile and stepped forward, causing his armour to rattle.* "What are you doing here?"

Lezard: "We request for an audience with his majesty."

Luna: "Yea, we gotta get home, aye."

Twortz: "We need some answers."

Rachael: "Please-"

Ordin: *He observed each party member, unintentionally snarling in disgust at Rachael, Twortz and Luna.* "How dare you three disrespect the ruler!"

Twortz: "Excuse me?"

Luna: "Aye?"

Nathan: (What did they do-?)

Ordin: "Look at your filthy appearances! The damned Scoldrants are far cleaner than the lot of you combined!" *He shouted, causing his voice to echo down the hallway.*

Lezard: "Jinkies, Ordin-?"

Ordin: "I am in the middle of setting up The Agoura Marbles! I don't have time to show the ruler a bunch of backwater villagers!"

Trevour: *He glanced at Rachael, Twortz and Luna, noticing their mud smeared clothes.* (I had not realised how easily their clothing attracts dirt and odour-)

Rachael: "Well, I also want to participate in this marble games."

Ordin: "..."

Nathan: "I am a warrior. I will also participate in the games." *He stood up straight and placed a hand on his sword.*

Ordin: "A warrior.."

Luna: "I'll fight too, aye!"

Ordin: "..." *He slowly turned back around and took several steps towards the opened doors.*

Twortz: "Where are you going? We are in the middle of a conversation, how incredibly unprofessional if you are indeed, high up.."

Ordin: *He paused due to Twortz and sighed, keeping his back facing the party.* "You wish to have an audience with Grey the fourth?"

Trevour: "That would be much appreciated, sir."

Ordin: "Hmph. There is a huge waiting list for people wanting to see him, even if I decide to put you on the list, why should I expedite your request?"

Luna: "'Cause we ain't from this worl-"

Lezard: "Because our stories aren't from this world.. He will be most indulged in our delicious stories."

Trevour: *He looked past Ordin and stared at the opened doors, only noticing darkness.* (It's as dark as night.. Perhaps it's a Spacial Funnel-?)

Ordin: *He ignored Lezard and focused in front, staring at the darkness.* "Speaking of warriors, what is he doing here? I don't recall any Consultant related business today."

Destiny: "Yeu?"

Luna: *She noticed Destiny trembling, causing her to stroke her fur for comfort.* (It's like Destiny is afraid of this guy?)

Trevour: "I am no longer a representative of the warriors, sir."

Ordin: "I wanted to forewarn you about my Ougi's potential, sir."

Trevour: "S-Sir?"

Ordin: ".. At the cost of my morals, I can kill even the strongest of captains with one stab of the heart.."

Luna: "Umm, pretty sure if someone gets stabbed in the heart, they die.."

Nathan: "Luna?" *He grunted, as if he wanted her to be quiet.*

Luna: "Aha, it's like saying, when people get killed, they die.. Like no shit-"

Ordin: *He turned back around, facing Luna.* "You have a warrior's blood running through your veins."

Luna: "Pssht, my parents are no warriors, aye-"

Ordin: "Despite this, you're still just a troubled little girl that doesn't know her place-"

Nathan: "Even though that's true, you don't need to hurt her dignity-"

Ordin: "Dignity? Look at her, she has no dignity."

Luna: "...-"

Lezard: (Oh dear, this isn't how I pictured our confrontation with Ordin would be.)

Ordin: "I no longer have the patience. Wait with the others and you'll eventually receive a pass to see the ruler-"

Twortz: "Is there not another way to get this pass sooner?"

Ordin: "..."

Trevour: "Please, sir."

Rachael: "We'll owe you-"

Karol: "P-Pwease?"

Ordin: (I don't have the time-) *He sighed in thought, as he readied to leave.* "You wanted to enter the games, correct?"

Rachael: "Sure do!"
Luna: "Damn right, aye!"
Nathan: "For sure!" *They spoke at the same time.*

Ordin: "Go sign up in the entertainment section of the city. The winner is honoured, by being personally graced with his majesty's presence."

Rachael: "Shooting two birds with one stone." *She smiled to herself.* "I'm really good at sports."

Twortz: "A win-win situation, only someone with half a brain and poor judgement wouldn't cease the opportunity-"

Ordin: "Hmph. The Agoura Marbles isn't just a sport. It's just as dangerous as Battling Oxident-" *He turned away and started to power walk into the darkness.* "If not worse."

*Ordin swayed his hand in the air, causing the doors to slam shut behind him on their own accord.*

Twortz: "..."

Ordin: "Not that it's plausible, but even if you do win, I will not grant you the permission to see his majesty if you don't clean yourselves up!" *His voice sternly echoed from behind the door.*

Rachael: "I will try my best to win!" *She formed a fist, frowning with a smile.*

Nathan: *He looked at Rachael and stood in a more casual manner.* "He's gone."

Rachael: "Oh.."

Trevour: "What's the plan now, everyone?"

Lezard: "Well, new clothes!" *He giggled, wiggling his bottom to each side.*

Luna: "I freakin' dislike goin' shopping for clothes-"

Rachael: "I don't mind it." *She smiled.*

Trevour: "Despite retrieving new clothes, we also need to sign up for the games."

Rachael: "We'll do both, no biggie."

Lezard: "Unfortunately, if the games are tomorrow, we might not be lucky enough to sign our names up."

Rachael: "If we had to choose, I'd prioritise seeking answers than a game."

Luna: "Where would we find clothes anyways? Pretty sure I didn't see a total gurlz shopping centre along the way here."

Nathan: "Despite the games, I came here for Luna."

Luna: *She looked away with blushing cheeks.* "Wateva."

Nathan: "So, I feel like I should get answers for her too."

Twortz: "Why? Are you two romantically attached?"

Luna and Nathan: "N-No?!"

Nathan and Luna: *They looked at each other in shock.* "Huh?!"

Luna and Nathan: "Stop that!"

Trevour: "Maybe we should focus on getting a pass to see the ruler then?"

Twortz: *She sighed, shaking her head.* "Isn't it obvious?"

Lezard: "Well, I didn't see Luna and Nathan being a couple-"

Luna and Nathan: "We're not!" *They shouted at the same time, hiding their embarrassment.*

Twortz: "Let's go." *She turned around and started to walk back down the hallway.*

Rachael: *She looked at Twortz in a curious-like manner.* "What is?"

Karol: "...-" *He silently followed Rachael down the hallway.*

Twortz: "We will split in two parties. Lezard will lead Trevour and myself to this entertainment section, while Nathan will lead Luna, Rachael and the child to retrieving appropriate garments."

Rachael: *She smiled, nodding her head in approval.* "Sounds great, Twortz."

Luna: "Yea, not bad, Twotters."

Twortz: "I am not Twotters."

Trevour: "What was your reasoning for having Lezard and Nathan act as the party leaders?"

Luna: "Jealous you weren't picked, aye?"

Destiny: "Yeup."

Trevour: "Negative, madam. Purely speaking from curiosity."

Twortz: "It is rather obvious they have clear knowledge about this city and how it works. It would be quite irresponsible if we were to allow the child to lead the party."

Karol: "I-I have a nayme!"

Luna: (He's so cute-)

Rachael: "His name is Karol, Twortz."

Twortz: *She ignored Rachael and waddled down the stairs.* "Where would a good place to meet up be?"

Trevour: "Maybe here?"

Luna: "Nah, too far, aye."

Lezard: "Perhaps at the entrance?"

Rachael: "That sounds good."

Twortz: "We'll split ways as soon as we leave the castle and meet at the entrance in an hour?"

Lezard: "Sounds deliciously good to me."

Nathan: (That was Ordin.. I've always wanted to see his fighting style, hopefully I'll get to impress him at the games if we manage to get in.)

Twortz: (What an inconvenience, I was hoping to see the ruler, get answers and leave..)

----------

Zazark: *He walked through a small clearing, surrounded by wooden logs which acted as a fortress.* "Fufufu, so weak.."

*Zazark smirked and glanced at motionless bodies on the ground, staring at their imperial-like armour.*

Zazark: "Blue and white armour, Silver Wind's own warriors. How pathetic.."

*Large iron beams were poking out of the warrior's bodies, as if a major fight had just happened.*

Zazark: "I've scanned the entire area.. Unless they're hiding in a Spacial Funnel, there's only one place where they could be-" *He flashstepped and reappeared into another clearing, outside of a forest.*

*Zazark smirked and stared at an island, ignoring a pulse of dirt which blew around him.*

Zazark: "Silver Wind Island..."

----------

*Nathan, Rachael, Luna and Karol walked down a long set of stairs, avoiding citizens who walked up the stairs.*

Nathan: "Down here-" *He spoke out of place, as he focused his attention to the level below.* "We should be able to find some new clothes for you to wear."

Luna: (Man, I didn't realise how much we stank, aye.)

Karol: *He skipped down the stairs and jumped on the bottom, watching Nathan, Rachael and Luna walk down them.* "This playce is hewg!"

Nathan: "Obviously."

Rachael: "Cheer up, dude." *She spoke with a smile and jogged down the stairs, glancing across a massive courtyard.*

Nathan: "Cheer up? I just don't like travelling with a child."

Luna: "Ooo." *She gasped with anticipation, as if she was trying to stir up a scene.*

Rachael: *She jumped beside Karol and placed her hand on his head.* "He's with me."

Karol: "Waichael?" *He looked up and smiled in a child-like manner.*

Nathan: "Didn't you mention something about being a man?"

Karol: "I-I am!" *He stamped his foot and pouted, pretending to be cool.*

Luna: (Despite being with Rachael, she's all sport and tomboyish.. Too much testosterone for me..) *She sighed in thought and awkwardly stepped forward off the stairs, as her sketch-like vision affected her perception.*

Rachael: "Well, I have to say, you've got some awesome sword skills."

Nathan: "Me?"

Luna: "Nah, she's talkin' about Destiny, aye."

Destiny: "Yeup?"

Rachael: "Hehe."

Nathan: "I'm not as good as I'd like to be, but thanks."

Karol: "I'ma man!" *He puffed out his chest and walked with his legs tensed and knees bent.*

Luna: Aha." *She laughed at Karol.* "So, Rachael, where'd you find mister little dancer over there?"

Rachael: "The Ruins of Estel."

Luna: "Aye?"

Nathan: "The city of the Elementalists?"

Luna: "Aye?"

Nathan: "So, you're obviously a dancer?"

Karol: "Y-Yheah."

Nathan: *He walked towards a large relaxing water fountain, passing several garage-like stores.* "It's really rare for any dancers to leave the city-" (Similar to Scoldrant Users-)

Karol: "And?" *He spoke in confusion, as if he didn't understand what Nathan meant.*

Nathan: "What are you doing here?"

Karol: "I-I, uhm..-"

Rachael: "He's with me, simple as that."

Nathan: "Fine." *He spoke with his deep voice and placed his hands on his head.*

Luna: *She looked in Rachael's general direction, causing Destiny to observe Rachael in detail.* "When did you get here?"

Rachael: "About a week now.. I think?" *She looked up, staring at a clear blue sky.*

Luna: "Same.. My perception of time is a little shit, aye, aha!"

Rachael: "Hehe, a matter of speaking." *She clicked her fingers, as if she remembered a question she wanted to ask earlier.* "How are you here?"

Nathan: *He noticed a store with a small red sword engraved on a wooden plank, causing him to walk towards it.* (That's the symbol used to notify warriors of special goods available to be sold.)

Luna: "Like I kinda said to Twotters before, I was in the store with Ky and Kay-Aye."

Rachael: "Who?"

Luna: *She rolled her eyes.* "Kylie and Kerry-Anne."

Rachael: "Oh? Were they transported too?"

Luna: "Umm, yea.."

Rachael: "Sweet. Where are they?"

Luna: "They're dead."

Rachael: "O-Oh.. Sorry to hear."

Luna: (In a way, they got wat we always wanted..)

Destiny: "Yeu.." *She purred in a sympathetic-like manner.*

Rachael: "And who is this?" *She spoke with a smile and placed her hand in front of Destiny's face.*

Destiny: "Yeup!" *She started to purr, as if she could trust Rachael.*

Rachael: "Hehe." *She ran her fingers through Destiny's purple fluffy fur.* (She's really soft. Almost like she's recently had a bath.)

Nathan: *He led the party inside the shop and made his way to the front desk, noticing several items up for display behind a glass door.* "Hello?"

*Nathan hit a golden shaped bell in a manly-like manner, trying to grab someone's attention.*

Luna: *She admired the bonding session between Rachael and Destiny.* "This is Destiny, aye."

Destiny: "Yeup!"

Karol: "Destiny?"

Luna: "Go for it." *She lowered her arms, allowing Karol to pet her.*

Karol: "Nee hee." *He giggled, listening to Destiny purr.*

Rachael: "She feels like a well-groomed cat."

Luna: "Kitty." *She giggled out of character.*

Rachael: "Kitty?"

Luna: "I mean-, I said, bitch tits."

Karol: "Butch teets?"

Luna: "Ahahaha, settle down tiger, wait 'til you hit puberty."

Karol: "Uhm-?"

Rachael: "Don't worry." *She shook her head at Luna, trying to hide her smile.*

?????: "Hello, you looking for business?" *A man with short dark red hair popped up from behind the counter, smiling at the party.*

Nathan: "We need some-"

?????: "Do you have money?"

Nathan: "Yes-?"

?????: "Fantastic!" *He chuckled with a widening smile and acted more professionally.* "My name is Kane, how can I help you?"

Nathan: "We need some clothes and an updated sword-"

Kane: "Oh? What's wrong with the one you got?"

Nathan: "When I used my Azure Bursts, it couldn't handle the Rasticsplash well and kept hurting my arm."

Kane: "I see. I see.." *He observed Rachael, noticing her bloodied knuckles.* "I have some gauntlets and Mythril based swords."

Nathan: "Mythril? There's no way we could afford that!-"

Kane: *He looked behind him and stared at a wall full of weapons.* "Here we go-" *He grabbed a large, long silver sword, gently throwing it at Nathan, as if he was confident he could catch it.*

Nathan: *He caught the sword in one hand and started to sway it around.* (It feels so light!)

Rachael: "Gauntlets?" *She spoke to herself and observed her knuckles.* (I always used to practice with combat gloves, but gauntlets-?)

Karol: "I fink you'll look grayt wiff guntlets!"

Rachael: "Alright, I'll get a pair of gauntlets."

Kane: "What colour, and-?" *He looked at Nathan with a mischievous smirk.* "You look like a fine warrior, I'll give it to you eighty percent off."

Nathan: "Eighty percent?!"

Kane: "Indeed." *He smiled in a professional-like manner and noticed the empty container on Luna's shoulder.* "And how about some arrows for the lovely lady?"

Luna: "I don't like you."

Kane: "Ah?" *He leant back slightly awkward.*

Karol: "Nee hee, me neiffer."

Kane: "And the young master?"

Rachael: "He's a Sacred Dancer."

Kane: *He looked surprised, as if he wasn't expecting to see a dancer.* "Well, I've got some boots for you!"

Luna: "Boots? Pssht."

Karol: "No, no-" *He looked at Luna, enthusiastically shaking his head.* "Dancers equip different shoes for different attacks."

Luna: "Aye?"

Destiny: "Yeup?"

Nathan: "Like swords, they have boots."

Luna: "Aha, that's kinda lame."

Karol: "N-Not layme!"

Kane: *He placed two small blue shoes on the counter and slid them slightly forward, as if he wanted Karol to see them.* "Here they are."

Karol: "W-What do they do?"

Kane: "These bad boys boost the offensive and defensive water affinity by two percent. They also shorten the time used to create glyphs."

Karol: "W-Wow!" *He giggled in amazement.*

Kane: (Excellent-) *He reached behind the register and threw two red gauntlets at Rachael.*

Rachael: *She caught the gloves and looked at them in confusion.* "These won't fit me.. They're way too big."

Kane: "All these items are the highest of quality."

Luna: "Wat does that mean?"

Karol: *He suddenly fell back and landed on his bottom, quickly plopping his shoes off.* "They have Astragons in them."

Luna: *She looked down and watched the boots suddenly open wider to Karol's feet, before tightly closing itself around his ankles.* "Whoa-"

Rachael: *She placed her hands in the gauntlets and watched them shrivel around her fingers, causing them to be a perfect fit.* "Nice."

Kane: "And here are elemental arrows."

Luna: "Aye?" *She focused her attention back to Kane, noticing he held a wooden container of blue feathered arrows.* "What are they?"

Nathan: "Arrows?"

Luna: "Aha, funny-"

Kane: "They say archers have it the worst when competing against other archers."

Karol: "Why?" *He jumped back up and stamped on the ground, listening to squishy-like noises.* "Nee hee, they sound like I was walking in the wain."

Kane: *He leant over the counter and looked at Karol's boots with a smile.* "Unless you know special Azure Bursts, there isn't much technique in firing off an arrow."

Luna: "Don't bullshit me-"

Kane: "I-? Pardon-?" *He spoke in shock.*

Destiny: "Yueerrsst." *She hissed, as if she was sticking up for Luna.*

Luna: "Archery requires immense technique and skill. You need to learn how to adjust the bow and aim to the air current and-"

Kane: "Where are you from?" *He spoke with a condescending tone.* "Any person can flick the string."

Luna: "Wat?" *She grunted in disagreement.*

Kane: "It's all about the technique of your Azure Bursts or possibly Ougi."

Luna: *She gritted her teeth.* "You're wrong-"

Rachael: *She placed her hand on Luna's arm.* "Maybe he's right.. We don't know what kind of fighters the archers are here-"

Kane: "Well, if you don't want them, I could easily sell them to the few other archers that are participating in the Agoura Marbles?"

Luna: "Others?"

Kane: "Yeah, and they'll have these ice exploding arrows."

Luna: "Ice explodin' arrows? Pssht, fine, I'm sold." *She grunted in a defeated-like manner.*

Destiny: "Yeu.."

Kane: "Alright!" *He clapped his hands and rubbed them in a greedy-like manner, moving closer to the register.*

Luna: (Ice explodin' arrows..) *She picked up the arrows from the counter and inspected them in a curious-like manner.*

Rachael: "Wait, we also need clothes."

Kane: "You can purchase material based equipment next door." *He smiled.*

Rachael: "That's rather odd?"

Luna: "Nah, in games, you've got the Inn, mart, then a second mart for inventory shit and a special clothes section thingy."

Rachael: "... Hey?" *She pulled an awkward smile.*

Karol: (In gaimez?) *He looked up to Luna, adjusting the laces to his boots.*

Luna: "Oh!" *She snapped her fingers in realisation, failing to notice Rachael's confusion.* "And the craftin' area-"

Kane: "Yes, the workshop is further down the centre." *He pointed to his right in agreement.*

Luna: "Aha, see. Nerd's heaven, right here." *She sniffed her finger and pretended to be cool.*

Rachael: "Rightio." *She spoke in confusion but understanding.*

Kane: "So, the Mythril sword, specialised gauntlets and boots, with a full battle's worth of elemental arrows, that comes to a total of-"

----------

Lezard: "Lezard, Twortz and Trevour walked up the mystical stairs of hope, in order to find the entertainment section-"

Twortz: "Don't make me regret going with you."

Trevour: "..." *He silently observed the way Twortz and Lezard interacted with each other.*

Lezard: "Well-" *He quickly walked around a cloud of steam, as a Middle Eastern looking man cooked steaks on a floating cooking board.*

Twortz: "We are to focus directly on the task at hand and meet up with the others."

Trevour: "That is a good mind frame to have."

Lezard: "Two boring people, sad face-"

Twortz: "Excuse me?"

Trevour: "Boring?"

Lezard: "I mean, why aren't we there yet? Mad face?" *He sarcastically spoke in fear and walked to the top of the stairs, noticing a large wooden bridge.*

Twortz: "We're a storey above the castle, where do we have to go?"

Lezard: "Well, we should be there soon." *He hobbled across the bridge, instantly noticing the change of tone in his footsteps.*

Trevour: "That doesn't actually answer her question, sir?"

Lezard: "Why can't we explore the city a little-?"

Twortz: "Work before leisure." *She followed Lezard and waddled off the bridge, noticing different coloured tiles on the ground.* "Oh?"

Trevour: "What a contrast choice of colours?"

Twortz: "This city gave a feeling of seriousness.. These tiles do not fit the city's image."

Lezard: "Right you are, my hungry lady! This is the third section of the city-"

Trevour: "Are you hungry, Twortz-?"

Twortz: "No." *She glared at Lezard, while keeping her professional-like posture.*

Lezard: "I've always liked the third level of the city." *He giggled and listened to a faint beat to a dance song, causing him to wiggle his bottom to each side.*

Twortz: "That.. Sounds like a club?"

Trevour: "A klub?" *He followed Lezard to an expansion of alleyways which lead towards large buildings.*

Twortz: (This place continues to get larger the more you explore it-)

Trevour: *He noticed a two storey wooden building, watching four flags flap from five pillars in front of it.* "What is that?"

Lezard: "I believe that's The Guild's Silver Tavern-"

Twortz: *She shook her head and looked down an alley, noticing a graffiti covered door at the end of it.* (The music is coming from there-)

Trevour: *He observed the tavern, stroking his chin in thought.* "There's nothing silver about that tavern?"

Lezard: *He giggled and walked in between two buildings.* "Sounds like a plot twist waiting to happen, bwarharh."

Twortz: "Stop talking, keep walking."

Trevour: "I believe we could benefit from learning more about this city's culture as we make our way to the destination, Twortz."

Twortz: *She sighed in agreement.* "... Carry on."

Lezard: "Thankies, Trevvy."

Trevour: "Trevour."

Twortz: "..."

Lezard: *He hobbled up to a set of massive grey stairs.* "Wowza, looks like these reach the top of the buildings."

Twortz: *She looked up, slowly shaking her head in disapproval.* "No.." (Look how high those stairs reach..)

Lezard: "Jinkies.. Another adventure-" *He jumped on the first stair in excitement.*

Trevour: *He observed the area around the stairs and noticed a small navy box with red glyphic symbols on it.* "This looks like an active Rosterology console."

Twortz: "Excuse me?"

Lezard: *He turned around, clapping his hands with a growing smile.* "Ooo, good eye, Trevourmotto!"

Twortz: *She waddled closer to the box, observing it in a curious-like manner.* "What do those glyphs mean?"

Trevour: "See how it's circular shaped? Ignoring the design itself, it is Astragon orientated-" *He mumbled the last words with a lack of concentration, as he opened his hand on the box.*

Twortz: "Allow me to do so-" *She waddled past Trevour and placed her hand on the box, causing the red glyph to shine.*

Lezard: "Ooo?!" *He rocked slightly forward, as the entire staircase started to move.* "Splendid!"

Twortz: *She watched the stairs move, causing her to smile.* (Like an escalator.)

Trevour: "If you're from a world without Rostical, how do you excel in it so well?"

Twortz: "Because I put in the work to obtain my results." *She spoke with an emotionless face and waddled up to the stairs, allowing them to take her up.*

Trevour: "I see.." *He mumbled to himself and hobbled up to the stairs.*

Lezard: *He looked up towards the end of the staircase, noticing bright light.* "How exciting. It's like these stairs travel up towards the sky itself."

Twortz: "What ludicrous."

Trevour: *He looked at Lezard while adjusting his shoulder plates.* "Could you please break down the third level for us?"

Lezard: "Indeed, little one."

Trevour and Twortz: "..."

Lezard: "It's split into four areas. The entertainment section, where we heard those delicious tunes."

Twortz: "Next?"

Lezard: "The Guild's Silver Tavern."

Twortz: "And then?"

Lezard: "The Entarlia Dome."

Twortz: "What is that?"

Lezard: "A specialised dome, created by the infamous Dawn. It specialises in focusing Astragons from any of the warriors signed up to the program."

Twortz: "And?" *She sounded as if she didn't care about the trivial facts.*

Lezard: "It allows people to fight Astral copies of the warriors."

Trevour: "That could serve excellent practice!"

Twortz: "Yes. Yes it would.."

Lezard: "Travellers usually dub it, the entertainment dome.."

Twortz: "Moving on?"

Lezard: "Then you have The Black Trade."

Twortz: "And what is that?"

Lezard: *Light slowly shined on the stairs and on to his face, as he almost appeared on the top of the stairs.* "It's the currency centre. A place to trade, sell, receive money from a guild's quest."

Twortz: "I understand."

Trevour: "And lastly, sir?"

Lezard: "The Hall of Oats." *He giggled, as he stepped off the stairs.*

Twortz: *She waddled next to Lezard and looked up, staring at the inside of an enormous white mansion.* "How did we get inside?"

Trevour: *He spun around, observing the mansion's oat-like walls.* "We are inside, aren't we?"

Lezard: "We passed through a Spacial Funnel."

Twortz: "Where exactly are we?"

Lezard: *He pointed forward, across a massive clean hallway.* "Several delicious guards dressed in blue and white imperial armour stood in front of an enormous white desk."

Trevour: "They're still signing people up. We made it in time."

Lezard: "Yes, but-..." *He looked behind him, noticing an enormous line.* "We've got some waiting to do."

Twortz: "Let's join the line." *She spoke in a stern voice and waddled towards the massive line of people.*

----------

Kane: *He watched Rachael, Luna, Nathan and Karol leave his garage-like store with a greedy smile.* "Please come back soon! Tell your friends! Kane Swerdna, he's your man!"

Nathan: *He wrapped the long silver sword behind his back, causing him to smirk in satisfaction.* "We got really lucky."

Luna: "These arrows better work, aye."

Destiny: "Yeup."

Rachael: *She formed fists, punching the air in front of her.* "These feel pretty good."

Karol: "He was actually vewy nice! Nee hee." *He giggled and purposely walked with a spring in his step, causing his boots to make squishy-like sounds.*

Nathan: "Next door you should be able to get your clothes-" *He walked into an old fashioned second-hand store with several mannequins displaying different type of clothes.*

Kane: "Welcome!" *He giggled in a girl's voice, flicking a strand of long red hair from an obvious wig on his head.*

Luna: "Ah, say wat?" *She hissed in disgust, glaring at Kane in a freaked out manner.*

Rachael: "Kane?"

Nathan: "Huh? As in the guy that just served us?"

Kane: "Kane? Nah nah nah-" *He/She spoke in a fake Asian accent.* "My name Simone!"

Karol: "Symoan?"

Kane: "Yah yah! I heard fwon my bwover, yooh whant sum clothes?"

Nathan: "Wow." *He spread his arms and rolled his eyes, queuing himself to leave.* "I'll wait outside."

Luna: (Such a typical dick-) *She grunted in thought, watching Nathan leave the store, causing a stereotypical store-like bell to ring.*

Karol: "Nafan?"

Kane: "Yooh liek, yooh liek?" *He/She pointed at several mannequins, causing Rachael to walk towards them.*

Rachael: "They're all brown.."

Luna: "Pssht, doesn't bother me, aye." *She grunted, staring at the mannequins from a black and white sketch-like perspective.*

Kane: "I can make deal, yah yah?" *He/She flicked the wig hair out of his/her face.*

Rachael: "Is there a change room?"

Kane: "Owh, noh noh, one saize fits all, yah yah!"

Luna: "Rachael?" *She grunted, as if it was Rachael's decision.*

Rachael: "Alright, we'll take three."

Kane: "Free? Noh noh, yooh must paiy monies!"

Rachael: "No, as in three." *She raised three fingers.*

Kane: "That manys? But there tooh of yooh, unless-" *He/She stood on his/her toes, looking at Karol from behind the counter.* "He wear she clothes, yah yah?"

Rachael: "We have another-"

Kane: *He/She shook his/her head.* "Nah nah, she come get it herself, yah yah?"

Luna: "Aha-" *She chuckled at Kane and quickly looked away, pretending she didn't laugh.*

Rachael: "Just two then please." *She kept a straight face.*

Kane: "Me go organise nhow, yah yah." *He/She started to wrap up two generic clothes in paper-like material.*

Luna: *She walked next to Rachael and stood at the counter.* "So.."

Rachael: "Don't say a word."

Luna: *She smirked and watched Kane hand Rachael the bags.* "I didn't say anythin', aye."

Karol: *He continued to stare at Kane.* "Aren't you Kayne?"

Kane: "Me? Noh noh!" *He/She enthusiastically shook his/her head.*

Karol: "Why are you speeking like that?" *He tilted his head, talking with an innocent mind frame.*

Kane: "Fank yooh! Come again, yah yah!" *He/She giggled with his/her eyes closed, as if he/she was waiting for Rachael and Luna to leave.*

Karol: "And why do you talk like that? I've nevarh heard that accel before."

Rachael: "Accent."

Karol: "Ackscent!" *He spoke in a proud-like manner.*

Kane: "Thank you, come again." *He/She unintentionally spoke in a different accent.*

Luna: "Wait a minute? That was Indian?"

Destiny: "Yeup?" *She tilted her head to one side in curiosity.*

Kane: "Fank yooh!"

Rachael: *She wrapped her arms around Luna and Karol before walking out the store.*

Kane: "Preasure doing business with yooh, yah yah!"

Nathan: (Preasure?) *He turned around, noticing Rachael, Luna, Karol and Destiny walk out of the store.* "You got the stuff?" *He spoke in a deep voice, placing his hands on his head.*

Luna: "Ahahaha, wat the bloody hell was all the about, aye?!"

Rachael: "Luna?"

Karol: "Hell?"

Luna: "Was it some freaky assed cross-dresser or a blatant racist? Ahahaha!"

Rachael: "Let's meet up with the others."

Nathan: "What's so funny?"

Luna: "More like-" *She glanced at Rachael.* "Why ain't you laughin'?"

Rachael: "I'm not sure if he did it purposely, but I didn't laugh out of respect."

Nathan: "Respect?"

Rachael: *She nodded her head and started to walk back down to the entrance.* "If he was being obvious or not, it would've been disrespectful to laugh in his face."

Luna: "Pssht, wateva. How borin', Ashton."

Rachael: (Ash..) *She smirked and formed a fist, causing the glove to make stretching leather sounds.*

Nathan: "I like it."

Karol: "I dhon't understand it." *He spoke in confusion and suddenly tripped on his foot, falling face-first onto the ground.*

Nathan: "Hmph-" *He sighed and quickly pulled Karol up, as if he was embarrassed that he tripped.*

Karol: "It herts." *He started to whine with quivering lips.*

Rachael: "Here-" *She opened her free arm, causing Karol to quickly run into it.*

Nathan: "A dancer or not, we shouldn't keep this child with us."

Karol: "I'ma-, I'ma man!" *He sniffed and pouted with a sad-filled frown.*

Nathan: *He ignored Karol and started to walk up the stairs.* "You think we should try and meet them up there?"

Luna: "Meet who up where?" *She grunted in confusion.*

Destiny: "Yeu?"

Rachael: "We're meant to be waiting for them near the entrance?"

Nathan: "If they're up on the third level, we'd have to pass them if they aren't already waiting for us."

Luna: "True."

Rachael: "Alright, let's do that."

Luna: *She yawned and rolled her eyes.* "I'm startin' to get bored, aye."

Nathan: "You're not from this world, how are you bored?"

Luna: "Ain't my fault your personalities are borin' as shit."

Nathan: "Hmph." *He frowned and started to walk faster.*

Rachael: *She pulled Karol closer to her, watching women holding umbrellas gracefully step down the stairs.* "I hope the others found the place to sign up easily."

----------

Lezard: "Twortz, Trevour and the luxurious Lezard waited in this horrible line for centuries-"

Old Woman: "Next." *Her voice echoed in the hallway.*

Lezard: *He watched the person in front of him walk towards the long desk, revealing they were first in the line.* "Jinkies! Told you two it'll be fast."

Twortz: "You were the one complaining how long we would have to wait."

Lezard: "Me? Never!"

Trevour: "Oh, but I do recall you doing this, sir."

Old Woman: "Next."

Lezard: "Yay!" *He giggled and skipped towards the desk, causing Twortz and Trevour to awkwardly follow him.*

Old Woman: "Are all three of you registering?"

Trevour: "Yes, my lady."

Lezard: "Your lady? Naww, are you two a couple?"

Old Woman: "I don't have time for this." *She slightly lowered the paperwork, implying she wasn't impressed.*

Twortz: "Excuse our unprofessional acquaintance, we also have three others signing up."

Old Woman: "Yes.. That makes six participants?"

Twortz: "Yes, thank you."

Old Woman: "Here are your numbers. Your names and the other participants please?"

Lezard: "Lezard!" *He giggled.*

Old Woman: "Last name?"

Lezard: "Oh? Esteed."

Twortz: "Twortz Montana." *She spoke in a professional-like manner.*

Trevour: "Trevour Meister."

Old Woman: "And the others?" *She finished writing their names on a sheet of paper.*

Trevour: "I.. Don't know their last names?"

Twortz: "Rachael Taylor."

Old Woman: "Yes?"

Twortz: "Luna Lighten." (Although, I don't see what use she could be.)

Old Woman: "And lastly?"

Lezard: "Jinkies! What's Nathan's last name?"

Trevour: "And, Nathan Brails."

Twortz: "How?"

Trevour: "The interrogation.. I know." *He mumbled under his breath so only Twortz and Lezard could hear.*

Old Woman: "This time tomorrow, the Reality Marble will be active."

Twortz: "Where?"

Old Woman: "Here? This must be your first time." *She slid a bunch of cards across the table with different numbers on them.*

Twortz: "Yes." *She quickly glanced at the cards, focusing her attention back to the old woman.*

Old Woman: "In this room, all participants will meet here. You will be prompted what to do after."

Trevour: "What about those who aren't entering, but just watching?"

Twortz: (Good question-)

Old Woman: "They also meet here, but will automatically enter a different Reality Marble."

Twortz: "I don't understand, everyone meets up here?"

Old Woman: "Yes."

Twortz: "How will they automatically enter a different place-?"

Lezard: "I see. It's on the cards." *He inspected one of the cards, noticing a detailed purple glyph on the back.*

Old Woman: "Yes." *She sounded impressed, as if not that many people knew about it.*

Twortz: "Fascinating."

Old Woman: *She looked past the party, noticing the line of people.* "Next."

Lezard: "That's our queue, little monsters." *He giggled and started to leave the hall.*

Twortz: *She slowly started to waddle after Lezard.* (He's much smarter than he lets on..)

Lezard: *He looked over his shoulder, staring at Trevour and Twortz with a widening smile.* "Mission complete?" *He giggled, focusing his attention back in front.*

Trevour: "Yes, sir. Heh heh."

Twortz: (They say you shouldn't really trust people who smile all the time-)

Trevour: "Twortz?" *He hobbled by her side, staring at Lezard's back.*

Twortz: *She noticed several people in the line glance at Trevour in fear and anger.* "What made you become a warrior?"

Trevour: "I-..?" *He sounded surprised, as if he wasn't expecting that question.*

Twortz: "I don't see what's so awkward about my question. Did you do something bad?"

Trevour: "Negative.." *He looked down, listening to his armour rattle.*

Twortz: "So?"

Trevour: "I come from a small clan of ground-based Rostical Users.. I decided to leave because I was frowned upon."

Twortz: "Oh? Why was that?"

Trevour: "I was only able to manipulate the ground when it was soft." *He spoke in disappointment, causing Twortz to look confused.*

Twortz: "Why do you sound upset? Surely manipulating sand or dirt is far superior to solid pillars."

Trevour: "I know, I know." *He suddenly walked through a warped gust of air, stepping on top of the enormous grey stairs.*

Twortz: "Back to my original question, why did you join the warriors, and how exactly did you do it?"

Trevour: "I felt the situation I was in a little temperamental, so I thought I had to do my own thing."

Twortz: (I see.) "And how did you join the warriors?"

Trevour: "Why..?"

Twortz: "I can't see someone just going up to this Sorrowprax and requesting to become a warrior."

Trevour: "Heh heh, you're very right.. I was lucky enough to ask a captain classed warrior-"

Lezard: *He looked over his shoulder, as half of the stairs cracked and moved like an escalator down the opposite way.* "Come on, children! I'm hungry and tired!"

Twortz: "How troubling.." *She hissed under her breath.*

----------

*Rachael, Nathan, Luna and Karol walked across the bridge, causing it to slightly sway.*

Karol: "Hey, everyfing looks different." *He giggled like a child and spread his arms, skipping onto the other side of the bridge.*

Nathan: "We must be close."

Rachael: "I'm a little excited about this race." *She spoke in excitement.*

Luna: "Yea, me too, aye."

Destiny: "Yeup."

Nathan: "Should you actually go?"

Luna: "Why shouldn't I?" *She grunted with a frown.*

Nathan: "Because of your eyesight."

Luna: "I'm fine, aye."

Destiny: "Yeup!"

Nathan: "But-"

Luna: "But nothin'! I won't let this stop me from doin' wat I want!"

Nathan: "Hah." *He smirked, causing Luna to look confused.*

Luna: "Wat's so funny?!"

Karol: "Nee hee!" *He unintentionally skipped ahead, driven by his excitement.*

Rachael: "Karol!" *She started to jog after Karol, ignoring the different coloured tiles on the ground.*

----------

Lezard: *He hopped off the stairs and giggled, quickly walking out of the alleyway.* "Ooo, now that the extravagant work is over, perhaps we can check out the entertainment section?!"

Twortz: "..."

Trevour: "Twortz?" *He looked at Twortz and glanced at Lezard, as if he was expecting her to respond.*

Twortz: *She shook her head, implying to ignore Lezard.* "Carry on."

Trevour: "You need to be careful what captain you ask though. Some captains have been known to kill people on sight."

Twortz: "Yes.." *She frowned in recollection.*

----------

Lezard: "Trust me-" *He gently lowered his arm, noticing Rachael keeping to herself.*

Rachael: "Who is that? Won't the snake attack her?" *She whispered to Lezard.*

Lezard: (I can't believe I face a captain as soon as I leave you, father monster-)

Rachael: "Hey?" *She looked at Lezard, waiting for his response.*

Lezard: "I fear that could be Nancy."

Rachael: "Nancy?" *She watched the snake suddenly spiral around Nancy, causing her to gasp.* (It is going to attack her-?!)

Lezard: *He watched Arthur slither behind Nancy, as if it was keeping watch on her surroundings.* (Having control of something so powerful.. Frightening.)

Nancy: "Let's see what is such a threat." *She spoke on her breath and stared at the tower in the distance with a widening smirk.*

Arthur: "Hssst." *He swayed his neck and slithered behind Nancy, leaving an S-shaped trail behind him from the previous Scoldrant's remains.*

Nancy: "Yes.." *She glanced at Arthur with a smirk, as if she could understand his hisses.* "Sending one of the top three warriors.. Whoever it is, they'll be dead before they even utter a word-"

Twortz: *She looked at Nancy.* "Th-Thank you-"

Nancy: *She paused and instantly glared at Twortz, causing Arthur to hiss for intimidation.* "You dare speak to me?"

Twortz: "I-I-?"

Lezard: "I fear, that's Nancy the feeder."

Rachael: "Why is she called-?"

Nancy: "Are you hungry, Arthur?"

Arthur: "Hsssst." *It slithered its tongue at Twortz, as if it was inspecting her.*

Rachael: "Crud." *She spoke in realisation.*

Nancy: *She heard the sounds of a faint siren come from the city, causing her to sigh in an annoyed-like manner.* "No feeding today, Arthur. Work calls."

Arthur: "Tsssskt."

----------

Twortz: "Who is the captain that can summon a large snake?"

Trevour: "Was the captain male or female?"

Twortz: "Female."

Trevour: (Besides Blake-, there's only one other Scoldrant User or summoner-) "Nancy."

Twortz: (Nancy..) *She formed a fist, as if she held a grudge.*

Trevour: *He stopped next to Lezard, noticing a large guild in matching colours stare him down.* "This appears to be a temperamental situation."

Twortz: "What has the fool got himself into now?" *She waddled up to Lezard and stood by his side, glancing at the guild members.*

----------

Luna: "Nah, oi! Wat's so funny?" *She grunted at Nathan.*

Nathan: "Not letting it stop you? I can't tell if that's respectable or stupid." *He unintentionally smiled at Luna.*

Luna: *She looked surprised by Nathan's smile and started to blush, causing Nathan to blush.* "Ahh.. Funny comin' from you, aye."

Nathan: *He stopped and faced Luna, looking confused.* "What is that supposed to mean?"

Luna: "You bein' stupid and callin' me stupid."

Nathan: "Ha ha, don't like being called a dummy?"

Luna: "I ain't stupid!" *She stepped forward, glaring at Nathan with growing anger.*

Nathan: "And how was I being stupid?"

Luna: "Pssht!"

Nathan: "Wow, real mature."

Luna: "Don't throw the mature card, it shits me off, aye."

Nathan: "If it isn't the first time you heard that card, maybe it might mean something?"

Luna: "Gah, get over yourself, aye-"

Rachael: "Guys!" *She shouted out, catching Nathan and Luna's attention.*

Nathan: *He quickly looked towards the sounds of Rachael's voice.* "Sounds like trouble."

----------

*Lezard, Twortz, Trevour, Karol and Rachael clustered together, staring off an opposing guild.*

Rachael: "What's happening here?"

Lezard: *He looked to his side, smiling at Rachael.* "Razzypoo."

Twortz: "Apparently these gentlemen find it hilarious to pick on people's appearances."

Man A: "There's also women in the guild, fatty." *He looked at Rachael, implying Twortz wasn't a woman.*

Twortz: "..."

Karol: "At leest she isn't fat on the inside!"

Man B: "Hohoho, little kid told you who's boss." *He grunted to his guild member.*

Man A: "Why, I'll teach you, kid!-" *He stepped forward, causing Nathan and Rachael to step in front of Karol.*

Karol: "Waichael? Nafan?"

Man A: "Who's kid is that?"

Trevour: "I don't believe that concerns you, sir?"

Man C: "Warrior scum!"

Luna: "Aha, look at these dickwads!" *She grunted, storming up to the party for support.*

Destiny: "Yeup!"

Man A: "Dick wads?" *He chuckled in disbelief, glancing at the men and women in his guild.*

Rachael: "What's your problem, dude?"

Woman A: "Like, dude?"

Woman B: "Tee hee. What a manly acting woman!"

Luna: "Aha, you wanna pay-out looks? You actually look like a man, Helga!"

Woman B: "Helga?"

Luna: "Need some help waxin' that hairy chest and back of yours, sugar tits?"

Nathan: *He discreetly smiled at Luna.* (She's so wild..)

Man A: "We failed our guild's mission-"

Woman B: "Don't bother explaining it to them." *She hissed.*

Man B: "I need a few drinks."

Man A: "These dirty lamps are in the way."

Lezard: "Ouchies! Morale has been dropped!" *He squealed, shaking his bottom to each side.*

Luna: "Boohoo, you failed your mission, have a cry, aye."

Woman A: "You don't know what it means to fail a request!"

Twortz: (I have no intention of this, this childish guild business.) *She sighed.*

Rachael: "How hard would being in a guild be?"

Man B and C: "Hard!"

Woman A and B: "You have no idea!"

Man A: *He pointed at Lezard with a frown.* "We call your weird friend some names, and then-" *He pointed around the entire party.* "Your whole party comes to the rescue."

Trevour: "Isn't that what it means to be in a guild, sir?"

Man B: "You're a warrior, you couldn't possibly understand!"

Karol: "Then, what does it meen?"

Man A: "We all don't have a home."

Woman A: "We've lost it one way or another."

Karol: (They all dhon't have a home..?) *He silently kept to himself.*

Lezard: (They don't...) *He looked slightly sad.*

Twortz: "How exactly is this our problem?"

Nathan: (Cold.) *He glanced at Twortz before focusing his attention back to the guild members.*

Rachael: *She looked at the wooden building, watching the four flags flap in the non-existent wind.* (So, a guild seems to be more than a club-)

Man A: "You see those flags?! Our guild will one day be on those pedestals!"

Trevour: "So those flags represent guilds?"

Woman B: "He doesn't know anything."

Man C: "Of course!" *He growled at Trevour in disgust.* "Those are the four strongest guilds across the land!"

Man B: "The Blazing Trio-"

Man A: "The Seraphic Sunders, the only guild with two members."

Man C: "The Black Brigade."

Trevour: (You're joking!)

Luna: "The Black Buggers? Ain't them the same people we encountered?"

Woman B: "And The Seaside Bandits."

Man A: "Let's get a drink!" *He shouted and rudely pushed through the party, staggering down an alleyway.*

Karol: *He watched the five-member guild stagger out of his sight.* (A guild.. A place for people with no homes..)

Lezard: "Well, they were friendly people, bwarharh."

Luna: "Um?" *She raised an eyebrow at Lezard.*

Rachael: *She lowered her arms and relaxed, glancing at Twortz.* "Twortz, you need to collect your clothes from the store, it's all bought."

Twortz: "Then why?"

Luna: "Some crazy cross-dressin' Asian wannabe said so."

Nathan: "A man shouldn't act like that." *He sighed to himself.*

Twortz: "How inconvenient.."

Trevour: "I'll escort you, Twortz."

Lezard: *He stretched and wiggled his bottom.* "Now that our heroes are back together, why don't we all rest at the Inn?"

Nathan: "In the castle?"

Lezard: "Yuppers!"

Rachael: "We'll meet you inside?" *She spoke as if they were about to part ways.*

Twortz: "Obviously." *She cupped her hands behind her back and readied to leave.*

Luna: "Shouldn't someone who's actually been to the store escort you, Twotters?"

Twortz: "I'm quite aware of the advantages, Lighten."

Luna: "Ooo, my last name, watch out-"

Twortz: "We will meet you in the castle." *She waddled around and started to leave.* "Come, Trevour."

Trevour: "R-Right-" *He glanced at Rachael and at the party.* "I'll see you all shortly." *He smiled and quickly hobbled after Twortz.*

Luna: *Her sketch-like vision suddenly blurred, causing her to instantly focus on Destiny.* "H-Huh?"

Destiny: "Yeu... Eup."

Rachael: "Luna?"

Luna: "I think Destiny's tired.." *She started to sway, as if she was losing balance.*

Lezard: "Well, I wanted to pay a visit to the entertainment areas around here-" *He looked down, placing his hand on Karol's head.* "But I didn't want to exclude poor little Karol here."

Karol: "Huh?"

Lezard: "Maybe Karol and Luna could get some rest together, while we check out the area furthermore?" *He looked at Nathan and Rachael, as if he was waiting for their response.*

Karol: "But I'm not tired-"

Luna: "And I don't need to be babied around, aye."

Nathan: "Ha ha-"

Luna: "Shuddup!-"

Rachael: "Both of you go already." *She sighed on her breath, causing Karol to comply.*

Luna: "Pssht, you think I'd be so easily fooled?"

Lezard: "But Loonamotto!-"

Luna: "Don't motto me!"

Nathan: "Give it more attention they said, it'll be fun they said." *He grunted in a deep voice and turned around, placing his hands on his head.*

Luna: "Oh, a comedian, aye? Pssht, wateva." *She frowned and glanced at Karol before stepping away.*

Destiny: "Yeueu."

Luna: (Man, I'm feelin' hell tired though..)

Karol: "See yoohs shoon." *He smiled at the party with a childish grin.*

Rachael: *She watched Luna and Karol leave.* "What just happened?"

Lezard: "Character development?"

Nathan: "No."

Lezard: "A pointless and dramatic scene?"

Nathan: "No-, wait? Yes."

Lezard: "Yay me! I was right-"

Rachael: "Come on, let's talk like normal people and head to the entertainment area!"

Lezard: "Yay!"

Nathan: *He smiled in agreement.* (It's a great place to unwind.)

----------

*Twortz and Trevour walked into the store, instantly noticing Kane.*

Kane: "Welcome-"

Twortz: "We are here for the clothing you failed to supply my acquaintances."

Trevour: "Acquaintances? You mean friends?"

Twortz: "Yes, indeed, sure.."

Kane: "How do I know you are the-?"

Twortz: "Are we seriously discussing this question? How unprofessional in itself, the sheer fact you could not sell products to potential paying clients-"

Kane: "But I did-"

Twortz: "Regardless of your sale, boosting customer morale is vital for business. It's one of the key factors in having your business potentially go viral."

Trevour: (She talks like a captain-)

Twortz: "Now, give me what I came here for and I'll be on my way!"

Kane: "R-Right!" *He stuttered in fear and quickly bent under the counter, wrapping up a larger blouse for Twortz.*

----------

Karol: "It's colder insyde the kastle." *He walked into an empty room, staring at six vacant beds.*

Luna: "Just be quiet and we'll get along fine, aye."

Karol: "You're weally gwumpy when you're tyred."

Luna: *She reached towards the bed, allowing Destiny to hop off her shoulder and down her arm.* "Shh.."

Destiny: *She hopped onto the bed and made her way next to the pillow, slowly curling up into a tiny fur ball.* "Yuee..."

Karol: *He stretched with a cute moan and crawled on top of the bed, lying on his belly.* (Good night, mummy, daddy..)

Luna: (Wonder wat the mother and doofy brother are up to?) *She rolled onto her side and hugged Destiny, listening to her purr before falling asleep.*

----------

*Rachael, Lezard and Nathan walked into a casino, club-like area, listening to a loud beat.*

Lezard: "Oooo, these tunes get the old bones flowing." *He shook his bottom to the beat.*

Rachael: "Hehe." *She smirked and started to rock her head, noticing a row of Rosterology consoles.* "They're like the casino slot machines."

Nathan: "The kasino?"

Rachael: *She shook her head.* "Just things from my world."

Lezard: "Let's keep looking around-" *He started to hobble to the entrance and opened the door, causing natural light to fill the area.* "I'm sure we'll have plenty of time to mess about after this race."

Nathan: "I'll stay here for a bit." *He went to sit down on the Rosterology console.*

Lezard: "Ooo, a gambler!"

Nathan: "Don't give me a title!"

Lezard: "Ooo, a non-gambling gambler?"

Nathan: "Lezard-"

Rachael: "We'll see you at the castle too!" *She smirked with an upbeat attitude and grabbed Lezard's hand before leaving the area.*

Nathan: *He placed his hand on the side of the console, causing the slots to activate.* (What will I do once I get Luna access to the research logs?)

*Nathan thought to himself and watched different images of glyphs appear on the screen, causing him to touch the console again.*

Nathan: (What about my goal to finding the location to this yellow-eyed disease?) *He shook his head and continued to touch the console, causing the glyphic slots to move again.*

----------

Lezard: "Lezard and Rachael embarked on another adventure to the-" *He hummed the last word, as he was wondering where he was going.* "To The Black Trade!"

Rachael: "What's that?"

Lezard: "It's like a twenty-four seven market, a market that sells forbidden items."

Rachael: (Pretty much like a black market.. As the name states-)

Lezard: "It's a succulent place to window shop, bwarharh." *He laughed out loud and hobbled down an alleyway, watching a black door highlight with white dots due to his presence.*

Rachael: "Hehe."

Lezard: "Now-" *He hobbled up to the door and placed his hand on one of the dots, causing it to turn green.*

Rachael: "What are you-?"

Lezard: "This-" *He ran his hand towards another dot, causing it to turn green.* "And-"

*Lezard ran his hand across the door and connected several other dots, causing a loud lock to click.*

Rachael: (It's similar to an unlocking screen on one of Melinda's mobile phones.)

Lezard: "There we go." *He smiled and waved his hand inside, implying for Rachael to step forward.* "Ladies, please."

Rachael: "Then go on then?" *She spoke in a playful manner.*

Lezard: "Bwarharh, thankies!" *He giggled and skipped through the door, causing it to make a vsssht-like sound.*

Rachael: (Walking through objects will probably be something I'll never get used to-) *She nodded her head and stepped through the door, causing it to make the same noise.*

Lezard: "And here we are, Razzypoo." *He smiled and waved his hand across a massive isle with markets on each side.*

Rachael: "Wow-" *She looked up, noticing the sky was completely black.* "It's like it's night."

Lezard: "Apparently it makes the environment more comfortable for deals or trades."

Rachael: "This place does seem cool." *She smirked to herself and started to walk down the isle, noticing a four-eyed lizard-like man selling different types of frogs.*

Lizard-faced Man: "Gert yrour frorgs, harlf prirce!"

Rachael: "Fair enough." *She continued to walk down the aisle.*

Lezard: *He hobbled by Rachael's side, noticing a small insect-like man selling glowing pots.*

Insect-like Man: "Wee-Warh, get your RPG bag inspired pots, wee-warh! Store items limitlessly!"

----------

Twortz: *She kept focus on the castle.* "Please excuse the abundance of questions, I just find the warrior system very fascinating."

Trevour: "Heh heh. No dramas at all, Twortz."

Twortz: "Excellent-"

?????: "Sqar-reeeh!"

Twortz: "What on Earth-?!" *She quickly glanced to the side, noticing a large grey ostrich.* "It's twice the size of me-?"

*A man wearing a cowboy hat staggered towards Twortz and Trevour.*

Trevour: "Sir?" *He shuffled in front of Twortz in a protective-like manner.*

Man: "I hereby own a Scoldrant ray-anch." *He adjusted his cowboy hat, chewing on some gum.*

Twortz: "That ostrich is a Scoldrant?"

Man and Trevour: "Ostruch?"

Twortz: "Ostrich."

Man: "My Scoldrants are the be-yast transportation on the-ese la-yands."

Twortz: "So, you expect people to ride these things?"

Man: "Why-?" *He looked over his shoulder, watching the Scoldrant peck at a tin of seeds.* "Ye-eys?"

Twortz: "I see.."

Man: "I travel from ta-own to ci-tee, my ray-anch is very popul-ar."

Trevour: "I've heard of people like you. Using Scoldrants for everyday life. You must be a Scoldrant User?"

Man: "Nawl." *He shook his head.* "Just got a dist-yant cous-een blood-line."

Twortz: "Excuse me? I can't understand a thing you're saying."

Trevour: "He's not a Scoldrant User, but got a little bloodline abilities in his veins."

Man: "Yee-harh." *He nodded his head, as if Trevour was correct.*

Twortz: "How you got that out of him beats me." *She shook her head at herself.*

Man: "We'll be he-ere for another two da-ays."

Trevour: "I've wanted to ride a Scoldrant for a long time. I think it would be fun."

Twortz: "I'll take it into consideration, thank you." *She spoke as if she didn't care and continued to waddle towards the castle.*

Trevour: "Many thanks, my kind sir, heh heh." *He smiled in respect and started to hobble after Twortz, causing his armour to rattle.*

Twortz: "If my body clock is still working, it should be nearing nightfall now."

Trevour: *He looked up, nodding his head.* "Yes, Twortz. They say this city never sleeps due to its consistent clear blue sky."

Twortz: "Wouldn't that get annoying?" *She walked across the grass, keeping her focus on the castle.*

Trevour: "I'm sure each house would have something to counteract it."

Twortz: "Regardless, I am tired. Feel free to do what you wish." *She walked through the castle's doors without waiting for Trevour's response.*

Trevour: *He watched the door ripple where Twortz stepped in before following her.* (I have plenty of time to explore the rest of the city. I'm quite beat up myself.)

----------

*Lezard and Rachael stood outside the black door, stretching in a tired-like manner.*

Lezard: "Razzypoo and Lezardypoo sighed with fatigue from a long and exhausting day-" *He paused to stretch in a different position.* "And after an amazingly succulent search through The Black Trade. Now it's time for some shut eye!"

Rachael: *She smiled at Lezard.* (I'm actually not that tired..)

Lezard: "Off to dreamland!" *He pointed at his head and giggled.*

Rachael: "You're a funny one, Lezard."

Lezard: "Naw, thankies!"

Rachael: "Hehe, come on then."

Lezard: "Yay." *He clapped his hands and suddenly yawned, lowering his usual chirpy self.*

----------

*Metallic scratches echoed from the empty Hall of Oats, followed by frail moans of pain.*

Zazark: "Fufufu." *He stood at the long table and chuckled, staring at bright red smear marks on the white ground around him.*

Old Woman: "No-" *She coughed out blood and looked down, staring at a metallic pole in her chest.*

Zazark: "Don't struggle, it'll hurt more." *He watched several dead people sit in awkward positions along the massive table.*

Old Woman: "Why?"

Zazark: "It's my mission, fufufufufu." *He turned around, cracking his head to each side.* "Thanks for signing me up in the race."

Old Woman: "Grey's warriors-"

Zazark: "Won't even know, right? This Spacial Funnel gets locked so no people can change or cheat The Agoura Marbles, right?"

Old Woman: "How did you-?"

Zazark: "I'm from around here." *He started to walk away, leaving behind bloody footprints.* "Nobody will know until after the race is done.. But by then-"

Old Woman: "It will be too late.." *She coughed out more blood and suddenly collapsed, causing the metallic pole to support her body at an awkward angle.*

Zazark: "Next stop, The Agoura Marbles, fufufufu." *He flashstepped, causing a faint buzzing sound to loudly echo in the empty hallways.*

Chapter 9: The Agoura Marbles

*Loud trumpets echoed in the castle, instantly waking up the entire party.*

Karol: "Wah-?!" *He suddenly rolled off the bed, hitting his head on the ground.* "Owch."

Rachael: *She leant up, looking at her hands in confusion.* (I couldn't get any sleep...)

Nathan: "What's that noise?" *He mumbled in a deep voice, placing a hand on his head.*

Luna: *She looked at Nathan.* "Why are the guys in here too?"

Lezard: "No more rooms-" *He raised his leg and stretched.* "And there's enough spare beds in here, little one-"

Twortz: "The trumpets are loud-" *She focused, causing the sounds to mute.* (They stopped-)

Luna: "It's effin' loud." *She placed her hands on her ears, alerting Twortz.*

Destiny: "Yeup?" *She meowed in disorientation.*

Twortz: *She looked around, listening to complete silence.* (I can also control the sounds I hear?)

Nathan: "Your senses have been heightened due to the Soul Link."

Luna: "Gah, fucks sake, Destiny."

Destiny: "Yeup!"

Trevour: *He staggered across the room and stood at the door, facing inside the room.* "Let's go. Apparently, they don't wait around for the contestants."

Rachael: "In that case-" *She jumped out of the bed in an athletic-like manner and adjusted red gloves on her hands.*

Lezard: *He slowly hobbled out of bed and watched the party all stand up, noticing their garments.* "Ooo, Loonz, Twortzamottus and Razzypoo's new clothing looks simply delicious-"

Twortz: "I thought I discussed with you what my name is?" *She placed her hands behind her back and walked down the hallway.*

Luna: "Settle down, Twotters, aye."

Lezard: "Ooo, a domestic plot twist-"

Twortz: "Am I the only normal person here?"

Karol: *His feet made squishy sounds, catching Lezard's attention.* "Why is she cwanky?"

Luna: "I have an idea, but there's no need to tell ya until you're older, aha."

Rachael: "Luna-"

Nathan: *He adjusted the sword behind his back and placed his hands on his head.* (I wonder if anyone else has noticed, that we'll all be competing against each other?)

----------

Lezard: *He hobbled through the castle doors and stepped on the grass, noticing an excited parade down the road-like path.* "Wowza-"

*The party shuffled behind Lezard, instantly focusing their attention to a large floating chair.*

?????: "Welcome to this year's Agoura Marbles!"

Lezard: "A powerful, yet slightly Asian voice echoed loudly across the city, followed by the inevitable cheers of-"

*The parade of people loudly cheered to the man's voice.*

Luna: *She squinted her eyes.* "Destiny?"

Destiny: "Yeup!" *The purple ring around her iris started to spiral.*

Luna: *She looked at the floating royal-like chair with heightened vision, noticing it stood on a green glyph.* "Who is he?"

Rachael: "You can see that far?"

Luna: "Yea."

Rachael: "Wicked." *She spoke with a smile and squinted her eyes, trying to get a better look at the man.*

Lezard: "Judging by the voice, that's Grey."

Trevour: "The ruler.." *He mumbled under his breath.*

Grey: "Those who are new to the games, just follow the experienced!" *The glyph under his chair started to spiral and float up to the next level of the city, causing the parade of people to move.*

Nathan: *He walked away from the castle and followed the parade.* (There's a lot of people here.)

Rachael: *She walked with the party, watching the people walk up the stairs.* (I don't know what to expect with this game.)

Nathan: "Everyone got their cards?"

Rachael: "Sure do." *She held the card, staring at the number forty-three on it.*

Lezard: "This is going to be a delicious race."

Twortz: "What makes you say that?"

Lezard: "Unlike Battling Oxident, the more participants in this race, the funner!"

Twortz: "Funner isn't a word-"

Rachael: "Don't be such a drag, Twortz." *She spoke in a mature-like manner and followed the parade up the stairs to the left.*

Karol: "What about me? Will I partissipate tooh?"

Luna: "It's dangerous, aye-"

Karol: "Stahp under-.. Under-est-i-mayting me!"

Nathan: "She says that because she's worried about you. Stop trying to act like something you're not!"

Karol: "..."

Nathan: "Hmph." *He walked slightly faster, purposely leaving the party.*

Trevour: "He's right, little one."

Karol: *He triggered flashbacks of running away from Kath and Ridley.* (If I was a man..) "If I was a man, that wouldn't have happened!"

Trevour: "What are you talking about, little meister?"

Karol: "It.. Doesn't mayter.."

Rachael: "Karol?"

Karol: "Humpf." *He folded his arms like a child.*

Rachael: (Even though we've been rather casual about exploring the city, I don't think any of us has had an opportunity to sit down and talk about ourselves.)

Twortz: (Don't be a drag?) *She slowly waddled behind the party, glaring at the party's back.* (How unprofessional.. That fake Rachael telling me what to do..)

*Twortz gritted her teeth and frowned in rage, causing a slight gust of wind to blow around her.*

Twortz: (The Rachael I know is dead.. If I see it with my eyes, there's no changing my mind... I think I've done enough travelling with you lot.. I'll get my answers once we view this city's database and-)

Luna: "C'mon, Twotters!"

Twortz: (Twotters?!) *She screamed in thought.*

----------

*Grey sat in his chair on the floating green glyph, watching the people step into The Hall of Oats.*

Grey: "Those without the glyphic markers will enter this hallway." *He spoke with an echoing voice, implying people will be entering soon.*

*Grey looked to his side, watching imperial soldiers clean the last remains of blood smears.*

Ordin: *He supervised the cleaning and looked up to Grey, touching his throat.* "I'm unable to locate this culprit. I recommend heightening security."

Grey: *He listened to Ordin's voice which echoed in his ear.* (I see-) *He placed his hand on his throat.* "I agree."

Ordin: *He heard different toned footsteps, causing him to turn around.* "Welcome, spectators!"

Grey: "Ordin, the person in charge of my affairs, protector of the city!-"

*The crowd started to cheer in Grey's and Ordin's presence.*

Man: "I can't believe the ruler, he's amazing!"

Woman: "I know! I close my store down for the day to come to The Agoura Marbles just to see them."

Grey: "Ordin will be the referee, and I will be the announcer, just like always-"

*Grey swayed his hand, causing enormous screens of different images of landscapes to appear all over the oat-like walls.*

Lezard: *He hobbled into the hallway with Karol, instantly noticing the screens.* "Majestic."

Karol: "W-What are they?"

Lezard: "Due to the Astragon filled walls, this place allows streaming footage of the races."

Karol: "Why is there so mhany scweens?"

Lezard: "Due to all the Reality Marbles."

Karol: "There's snow.. Fire.. Night.. Day.. Indoars, outdoars?" *He spoke in disbelief, as if he couldn't comprehend the thought.*

Man: *He stared at one of the screens and waved papers in the air, cheering on a person who warped into an open field.* "I got a lot of money betting on you!"

Karol: "People are starting to warp into the images? Where is Waichael?"

Lezard: "I remember their numbers-" *He hobbled up to a large pedestal with a large floating, spinning sphere with hundreds of different coloured numbers around it.*

Karol: "What is that?"

Lezard: "This is merely a tracker. Their colours tell us what Reality Marble they're in."

Karol: *He spun around, noticing faint coloured borders around each image.* "I fink I get it."

Lezard: "Her number is brown, so is Nathan's!-" *He hobbled around and instantly stared at the image with the brown border.*

Karol: "It's dark in there."

Lezard: "Looks like they're inside somewhere-"

*Rachael and Nathan found themselves in a long underground tunnel, lit up by the sunlight which shone through deep cracks in the walls.*

Rachael: "What do we do?" *She spoke to Nathan while adjusting the gloves around her hands.* "And where are the others?"

Nathan: "They're probably in different Reality Marbles-"

Rachael: "Karh-" *She suddenly coughed and leant forward with buckling knees.* (Crap-)

Nathan: "You alright?" *He spoke in a deep voice.*

Rachael: "Yeah." *She shook her head, noticing other people warp into the area behind her.*

Nathan: (There're about twenty people here-)

Grey: "The objective is to run forward, or, move forward. There are no secret paths, if you move out of the path, it's your own provocative to find the next Reality Marble."

Rachael: "His voice echoes in the air?"

----------

*Luna and Twortz found themselves in a large mansion with no active lights.*

Twortz: (I just heard Grey's voice-)

Luna: "It's night?"

Twortz: "I can hardly see a thing?" *She stepped forward, causing the floors to creak.* "It's very old too."

Woman: "I-I'm scared!"

Twortz: (It is a little frightening if you've got an overly active imagination.)

Luna: (Scared-?) *She turned around, noticing another twelve other people behind her.* "Pssht, this is nothin'."

Grey: "We've marked the Reality Marbles with a glowing door frame."

Luna: "Pssht, how easy. There's a door right here?" *She strutted towards the door and opened it, staring at an empty eerie room.*

Twortz: "If you actually listened, he said glowing door frame."

Luna: "If you actually listened." *She mimicked Twortz in a negative manner.*

Twortz: "Hermph." *She looked away, as if she couldn't be bothered with Luna's attitude.*

----------

*Trevour appeared in an enormous forest with trees as thick as cars, which towered into a bright orange sky.*

Trevour: "Hmm. I feel a little bit of turbulence waiting to happen." *He mumbled to himself and noticed people behind him.* "I think we should help each other out until we reach the last Reality Marble-"

Woman: *She looked at Trevour, snarling at his appearance.* "As if! Every person for themselves!"

Trevour: "But working as a team-"

Woman: "Who cares! There's only one winner!"

Trevour: "Negative, madam-"

Woman: "So there's more than one winner?"

Trevour: "N-No-"

Woman: "I already know the rules! Bye!" *She snickered and started to run through the forest.*

Grey: "Now that all contestants are in the marble, time to explain the rules!"

*Grey listened to his voice echo twenty times, as it channelled through each Reality Marble.*

Grey: "Contestants must endure or complete five Reality Marbles."

Twortz: (Five?) *She looked up to the old mansion roof, staring at flickering chandeliers.* (Depends how big these Reality Marbles are.)

Grey: "It's possible to get the same one twice. Doors with glowing frames symbolises the next jump, as I already mentioned before."

Rachael: *She formed a fist, looking at Nathan.* (We could get this area twice?)

Nathan: "Doors with glowing frames? Seems easy enough."

Grey: "The most important rule of all! You must keep moving. If you stop for three seconds, you will fail."

Trevour: (I can see why that impatient madam was eager to go so early.)

Grey: "It's possible to die in the games, all you have to do is rip up your number. If you don't, it's not Silver Wind Island's problem."

Luna: "Wat's gonna kill us? Attack of them hangin' lights?"

Twortz: "You mean chandeliers?"

Luna: "Wateva. They're lights, aye."

Grey: "The first person to step through the last door in the final stadium wins. If two people step on the stadium, they will go into a sudden death."

Rachael: (Sudden death?)

Grey: "Contestants, ready?!"

Ordin: *He monitored the busy Hall of Oats, watching people cluster around each image.* (We have a murderer on the loose and this happens to be a very busy Agoura Marbles? What luck! Blast the Astragons!)

Grey: "Once the siren goes off, the race has officially begun. Be warned, each Reality Marble will increase in difficulty."

Luna: "I'm ready, you ready?" *She looked at her shoulder, staring at Destiny.*

Destiny: "Yeup." *Her eyes glared like a cat's eye, allowing her and Luna to see with a brighter vision.*

Luna: (My black and white vision got a little brighter, kool.)

----------

Lezard: "Beep... Beep.. Booop." *He mimicked the buzzer and noticed an increased movement of the spectators, as each contestant started to run.*

Karol: "W-What happening?" *He looked up, pulling on Lezard's clothes.*

Lezard: "It's started-"

----------

Nathan: *He noticed every player's number materialise itself on their chest.* (My number? It's on my chest too.)

Rachael: *She watched all the players run down the underground tunnel.* "Where-?"

*Rachael's number started to beep, catching Nathan's attention.*

Nathan: "Remember the most important rule!" *He shouted and grabbed Rachael's hand before running down the tunnel.*

Rachael: "How can it?" *She looked down, noticing it no longer beeped.*

Nathan: "I'm not very smart with Astragons and Neurons, but I think the glyph detects the Neuron movement in the body."

*Several screams echoed further ahead of Rachael and Nathan.*

Rachael: "Sounds like they were in pain-" *She suddenly looked down, gasping in confusion.* "Do you feel that?"

Nathan: "Feel what?"

Rachael: "It feels like something rolling?"

Nathan: "Maybe that's your elemental affinity's ability?"

Rachael: "I use ground.. Able to feel the movement-" *She spoke to herself before nodding her head in agreement.* "I think you're right, Nathan-"

Nathan: *He quickly pushed Rachael forward and jumped back, causing his number to start beeping.* "Hmph-" *He watched a small cannon-like boulder shoot from the tunnel's opening, smashing into the other side.*

*Nathan looked up and intensely stared at the crack in the tunnel, watching something move in the sunlight.*

Rachael: *She continued to jog forward, watching the wall crumble.* "What was that?"

Nathan: "I feel we're not by ourselves-" *He noticed a woman on the ground with three stone spikes sticking out of her neck.*

Rachael: "Is she-?"

Nathan: "She mustn't have had enough time to rip up her number."

Rachael: "Are they traps?"

Nathan: "I don't think so-"

Rachael: "Rock Pillar." *She punched to the side, causing a small rock to blast up on the side of Nathan's face.*

Nathan: "What are you-?" *He watched the small rock suddenly explode, as it blocked a rock spike's projectile.*

Rachael: "It may be last minute, but I can feel when there's Earth moving in the air."

Nathan: "Earth?"

Rachael: "Ground, rock."

Nathan: *He listened to bat-like squeaks, instantly causing him to run slightly faster.* "I wasn't sure at first, but-"

*Rachael and Nathan suddenly slipped on smooth rock, causing them to slide down on their backs.*

Rachael: "What is it?"

Nathan: "These are near blind Scoldrants. They live deep in secluded caves or ravines."

Rachael: *She noticed a brown beaver-like Scoldrant crawling along the ceiling with its back facing her.* "Is that it-?"

Nathan: *He noticed rock spikes shoot out of its back, causing him to gasp.* "It's going to attack-"

Rachael: "Rock Pillar-" *She waved to the side and nothing happened, causing her to gasp in shock.* "Why-?"

Nathan: "The ground, it's too hard-" *He reached over his shoulder and grabbed the sword, trying to pull it forward.* (I'm sliding on my back, I can't-)

Rachael: "Here-" *She kicked Nathan, causing them to slide on each wall, watching the rock spikes jab in between them.*

Nathan: *He watched the rock spikes crack the hard smooth ground in shock.* "Thanks!"

Rachael: "Hehe, it's not over yet-"

*Rachael and Nathan slid out of the tunnel and fell through a large space, suddenly diving into pitch black water.*

Nathan: *He slowly sunk, watching white clear bubbles float up.* (There's an underground lake?)

Rachael: *She held her breath and started to swim up to the surface, taking a deep breath.* "Nathan?" *She coughed and wiped her mouth, glancing to each side.*

Nathan: "Psssh-t-" *He took a deep breath and shook his head, causing water to flick out of his hair like a dog.* "I wasn't expecting that-"

*Several floating bodies drifted past Nathan, causing him to respectfully push them away.*

Rachael: "Neither did they.." *She swayed her arms and kicked her legs, keeping afloat.*

Nathan: *He looked to his side and noticed another cave, causing him to swim towards it.* "I was worried."

Rachael: *She swam by Nathan's side.* "Why?"

Nathan: *He smiled, watching Rachael swim ahead of him.* "I thought I was going to have to help you."

Rachael: *She reached towards the rock and tried to pull herself up, causing her hand to slip off.* "Slippery-"

Nathan: *He reached up and rested his arm on the rock, trying to pull himself out of the water.* "The water, it's making the rock slippery-"

Rachael: *She suddenly dug her nails and fingers into the ground, allowing her to pull herself up with ease.* "There-"

Nathan: "Is it soft?" *He slapped the rock with an eagle-like grip, causing his fingers to crack.* "Ouch-"

Rachael: "Hello, ground user here, hehe." *She smiled and bent down, pulling Nathan up.*

Nathan: "Gee, thank you again." *He spoke with an appreciative frown, as if he was slightly embarrassed.*

Rachael: "Don't be embarrassed because I'm a girl."

Nathan: *He shook his head and reached over his shoulder, unsheathing his sword.* "That's not it. I couldn't care less what gender you are."

Rachael: *She smiled.* "I like that."

Nathan: "It's more of the fact I feel like a hindrance."

Rachael: "Say what? No way! I would've been out right at the start with that rock spike." *She had a flashback of Nathan pushing her out of the way.*

Nathan: *He grunted in respect.* "Let's keep going." *He nudged his head towards the cave, causing Rachael to jog towards it.*

Rachael: *She entered the cave and listened to her echoing footsteps, watching the area turn pitch black.* "Man, it's dark in here."

Nathan: *He slowed down.* "How is it?"

Rachael: "It's safe."

Nathan: *He ran towards the sounds of Rachael's footsteps and slashed his sword, causing a line of sparks to momentarily light up his surroundings.* "How much farther?"

Rachael: *She watched Nathan continuously slash sparks against the wall.* (Nice idea-) "We're almost out of here-"

*Nathan and Rachael ran out of the cave and found themselves in a large underground opening, noticing a glowing door frame standing in the middle of the clearing.*

Rachael: "There it is-" *She spoke with excitement and stepped forward, suddenly pausing.*

Nathan: "What is it?"

Rachael: "We're not alone-"

*Pirate-like bandits dressed in blue and black suddenly ran out from the shadows, pointing old fashioned guns at Rachael and Nathan.*

Nathan: *He noticed the guns, causing him to raise his sword.* "Let us pass."

Grunt A: "No, argh." *He grunted like a pirate and aimed for Nathan's head.*

Rachael: "Who are you?"

Grunt A: "We're The Seaside Bandits."

Nathan: "What do you want from us?"

Grunt B: "It's easy. Give us your valuables and we'll let you pass through to the next Reality Marble."

Grunt A: "The boss will be pleased, argh."

Rachael: *Her number started to beep.* "Oh no-"

Grunt B: "Move slightly forward from activating your numbers!"

Rachael: *She shuffled her feet and frowned in disgust.* "What a cheap way to get valuables!"

Nathan: "Isn't this against the rules?!"

Grunt C: "Rules, shmules." *He waved the gun to each side in a casual-like manner.*

Rachael: "Nathan." *She whispered.*

Nathan: "Yeah?" *He spoke on his breath and leant closer to Rachael, as he kept his sword pointed at the closest bandit.*

Rachael: "We'll make a run for it."

Nathan: "My sword skills have allowed me to block high-speed projectiles, but not if I'm surrounded."

Rachael: (Ash.. What should I do?) *She glanced at each bandit, triggering a flashback.*

----------

*Rachael and Ashton ran through a beautiful park and slowed down, sitting on a white expensive appearing bench.*

Rachael: "Phew."

Ashton: "Good grief." *He panted in exhaustion and fell into the chair.*

Rachael: "Hehe, tired much?"

Ashton: "I blame Fast Food Enterprise!"

Rachael: "Nah, blame yourself." *She spoke with a smile.*

Ashton: "Ha ha, I'm unacceptable, right?"

Rachael: "Right!"

Ashton: *He wiped sweat and looked to his side at Rachael.* "Thank you for taking me with you."

Rachael: *She shook her head with a widening smile.* "It's fine.. How were you able to keep up?"

Ashton: "Ha ha.." *He looked down and rested his hands on his knees, as he was trying to catch his breath.* "I usually ignore my surroundings and focus purely on the goal, and that goal was this bench."

Rachael: "Ignoring your surroundings? That's completely the opposite of what I'm taught at Hapkido."

Ashton: "But I'm more of the defensive type of guy, while you're-"

Rachael: "The type who shouldn't like pushover guys?" *She pushed Ashton, causing them both to chuckle.*

Ashton: "If I know my surroundings or protect myself from them, all I have to worry about, is the goal."

Rachael: "Well, if any guy gives you a problem, just let me know."

Ashton: *He smiled and shook his head.* "Violence is unacceptable."

Rachael: "Not this again, Ash."

Ashton: "Right-" *He stood up and kissed Rachael.* "I have to pick Lance up soon, I better be off."

Rachael: "Alrighty. See you tonight?"

Ashton: "Sure." *He smiled and turned around, jogging away with a slight limp.*

Rachael: "Hehe."

----------

Nathan: *He noticed his number start to beep, causing the bandits to chuckle.* (Dang it!-)

Rachael: (Ignore the surroundings-) *She frowned and started to concentrate, causing her body to glow a shade of blue.*

Grunt C: "She's using an Azure Burst, what should we do, argh?"

Grunt A: "Our boss was able to steal some of the contestant's statistics. There's not many to be worried about. That's why we decided to do this in the first place."

Grunt B: "Now, just give us your belongings!" *He clicked a lever on the gun.* "The others had no problem doing so, argh!"

Nathan: *He slightly lowered the sword in realisation.* "I hate to say, but I think we have no choice."

Rachael: *She suddenly leant up with widening eyes and dropped to her knees, violently punching the ground with both hands.* "Rock Pillar."

Nathan: "Huh?"
Grunts A, B, C: "Argh?"

*Two sheets of rock erupted on either side of Rachael and Nathan, forming a triangle-like tunnel towards the door.*

Nathan: "How-?"

Rachael: *She grunted and stood up, quickly jogging towards the door.* "Nathan!"

Nathan: *He ran after Rachael, blindly staring at the glowing door frames, as that's the only thing he could see inside the triangle made tunnel.* (Almost-)

Grunt A: *He started to fire off thick golden bullets at the rock, watching it spiral off.* "How?"

Grunt B: "It's the smoothness and angle-" *He bent his knees and shot a golden bullet at the rock, watching it ricochet off.*

Grunt C: "It didn't work, argh!"

Nathan: *He watched Rachael run up to the door, ignoring the sounds of guns go off.* "How did you-?"

Rachael: "The door, do we walk through it?! Unlock it with a key?! How do we-?!" *She touched the door and instantly faded, leaving a warped ripple in the air.*

Nathan: *He smiled in accomplishment.* "Yes!" *He touched the door, causing his body to instantly fade into a ripple in the air.*

----------

*Luna and Twortz slowly staggered through the eerie mansion, listening to the wind blowing outside, causing it to randomly creak from every direction.*

Twortz: (This is slightly frightening-) *She looked at Luna, noticing no signs of fear in her face.*

Luna: *A woman screamed in agony outside the mansion, causing Twortz to twitch in fear.* (That's the seventh scream..)

Twortz: (It's obvious, whatever is outside, is dangerous..)

Luna: "Where exactly are we?"

Twortz: "If it hasn't clicked inside that empty skull of yours, I'm from Earth too.. How would I know?"

Luna: *Lightning flashed outside, causing light to fill the poorly lit room.* "We're in a dinin' room."

Twortz: *She started to shiver while keeping a professional composure.* (This is frightening-)

*Lightning flashed in the room, revealing three wolf-like figures standing against the walls behind Twortz and Luna.*

Destiny: "Y-Yeup?"

Luna: "It's OK, there's nothin' to worry about." *She smirked and shuffled into the next room.*

Man: "H-Help?" *He suddenly lunged at Twortz from the shadows, covered in blood.*

Twortz: "Hahackee!" *She screamed out a sonic shock wave, blasting the man back into the wall, causing wood to crack.*

Man: "W-We're not alone..." *He quickly ripped his number, causing him to vanish upwards.*

Luna: "Nice."

Twortz: "Nice?! Is this some sort of game to you?!"

Luna: "Yea? That's wat this is, aye?"

Twortz: "Tsst." *She rolled her eyes and waddled towards the next room, observing a table full of cutlery.* "The food is still warm."

Luna: "Looks like they left in a hurry." *She spoke with anticipation, filling Twortz with more fear.*

*The lightning flashed, revealing a wolf-like creature standing in the doorway the party just walked through a moment ago.*

Twortz: "It feels like we're being watched.." *She looked behind her, staring at darkness.*

Luna: "Aha, stop bein' paranoid, aye-" *She looked over her shoulder with her sketch-like vision, seeing an empty room.* "Nothin'."

Twortz: "How can I rely on your vision?! You apparently can't even see colours!"

Luna: "Wateva-"

?????: "Shngrrrr."

*A canine growled, causing Twortz to shuffle closer to Luna.*

Twortz: *She stared at a closed brown door in front of her.* "I-It sounded like it came from the next room!"

Luna: *She reached over her shoulder, grabbing her bow and several arrows.* "Time to test these bad boys out."

Twortz: *She reached for the closed door and twisted its silver knob, revealing it was locked.* "It won't open."

Luna: "I can see that.." *She shuffled forward and attempted to kick the door, causing her and Destiny to grunt in pain.*

Destiny: "Yeu-Yeu!" *She hissed in pain, as if her leg was hurt too.*

Luna: "My bad, aye-"

Twortz: (Stupid-) *She waved her hand, blowing a scattered shock wave into the door, blasting it off its hinges.* "Sonic Rush."

Luna: "Whoa!"

?????: "Gnarl!" *A wolf-like Scoldrant ran on its hind legs directly towards Luna and Twortz, extending its arms out.*

Luna: *She flicked the string to her bow, firing off an arrow.* "Oh, yea." *She smirked, watching the arrow jab directly into the Scoldrant's forehead, before exploding its head in a boulder of ice.*

Twortz: *She watched the Scoldrant collapse and slide along the ground to her feet.* "..."

Luna: "Aha." *She cockily sniffed her finger and walked over the Scoldrant, glancing to each side.*

Twortz: "Aren't you scared?"

Luna: "Yea."

Twortz: "You d-don't act like it-" *A wolf howled in the distance, followed by a man's scream.*

Luna: *She placed another arrow on the bow and cautiously walked into the next room.* "We're lookin' for a glowin' door, yea?"

Twortz: "A glowing door frame."

Luna: *She stepped into another room and noticed brown leaves blow inside from an opened door.* "Well-" *She looked up, noticing two sets of stairs going up to the next storey.*

Twortz: "Tsst-" *She rudely waddled past Luna and slammed the door shut, locking it in relief.*

Luna: "Yea, lockin' the door will surely keep them dogs out, aye."

Twortz: "Well.." *She suddenly frowned in anger to mask her fear.* "Don't talk to me in a condescending manner!"

Luna: "Wateva hey." *She sighed and started to walk up the stairs, listening to it creak with every footstep.* "Shut up will ya?" *She grunted at the stairs.*

Twortz: "We have to go through another four after this."

Luna: "So?" *She grunted with a lack of concentration, as she kept focus on her surroundings.*

Twortz: *She waddled up the other set of stairs, cautiously looking around in a paranoid-like manner.* "I sincerely hope the others aren't like this."

Luna: "Yea, well-" *Wolf-like arms suddenly smashed out of the wall next to Luna and grabbed onto her.* "Shit!-"

Twortz: "Lighten!" *She took a deep breath and stopped in realisation.* (I can't Sonic Roar like this! I might blow her arm off!-)

Luna: "Gah-?!" *The arms suddenly pulled Luna into the wall, causing Twortz to quickly run up the stairs.*

*Lezard and Karol watched from the screen, ignoring the excited and angry spectators around them.*

Karol: "Holy Neurons, Lezard!"

Lezard: "I know, little one! Can't believe nobody has tried to turn on the lights!"

Karol: "N-No, Loona!"

Lezard: "Oh, and that too!"

Karol: "Peeple have died."

Lezard: "From the brief experience with Loonz, I'm sure she can handle her own."

Karol: *He silently nodded his head and focused back to the screen, watching Twortz waddle loudly down a hallway.*

Twortz: "Hick-Hick-" *She breathed with an unhealthy wheeze, glancing at a table and a set of armour which rested against the wall.*

*Twortz started to waddle faster, ignoring the sounds of wolves attacking a woman.*

Twortz: (I didn't get to where I am by looking out for others!-) "Sonic Rush." *She swayed her hand to the side, blasting a hidden wolf into the wall.*

*Twortz looked at a large wooden door at the end of the hallway, causing her to take a deep breath.*

Twortz: "Sonic Roar."

*Twortz continued to quickly waddle down the hallway and screamed out a shock wave, exploding the large wooden door out of its hinges.*

Twortz: *She watched wood splinter around the hinges allowing her to push through the door with ease.* "Hckee?"

*Twortz leant over a metallic rail and looked down, noticing a white door with a glowing frame.*

Twortz: "Hahahackee!" *She laughed in relief.* (Down below! There it is!-)

*Twortz looked to the side and noticed massive spiral stairs leading down to the level below.*

Twortz: *She started to waddle down the spiral stairs, ignoring the eerier environment around her.* (Almost there, Twortz. Almost there-)

*Three wolf-like Scoldrants barged through the door Twortz opened and growled to each side, as if they were hunting.*

Twortz: *She watched the wooden door spiral past her, crashing into the floor.* "Excuse me?"

*Twortz looked up, watching the Scoldrants violently rampage down the spiral stairs.*

Twortz: *She stopped and formed a triangle with her fingers, queuing her number to start beeping.* "How annoying-"

*Twortz continued to quickly waddle down the stairs, ignoring the scary growls and barks of the Scoldrants behind her.*

Twortz: "Now-" *She hopped off the stairs and waddled towards the door.* (With my speed, I won't be able to outrun these animals-)

Scoldrant: "Gnarl!" *It suddenly jumped off the spiral stairs and dived onto its front legs, allowing it to sprint towards Twortz on all fours.*

Twortz: "Sacred scores-" *She spun around and formed a triangle with her fingers.* "Sonic Pulsar."

*Twortz breathed into the spaces in between her fingers, blasting a vortex of sound at the wolf-like Scoldrant.*

Scoldrant: "Grnarl!-" *It yelped and violently spiralled on its side, cracking its arm out of place as it violently landed at an awkward angle.*

Twortz: *She slowly waddled on a side to keep an eye on her surroundings, making her way to the door with glowing frames.* "Sonic Rush." *She swayed her arm, blowing a scattered shock wave in front of her trying to intimidate the Scoldrants.*

Scoldrant: *It sniffed the air around Twortz, causing it to snarl in excitement.* "Grrrrnarl."

Twortz: (I didn't want to use it now-) *She reached over her shoulder, grabbing hold onto something.*

*Another two Scoldrants appeared behind Twortz and stood on their hind legs, towering over Twortz.*

Twortz: "Begone, feral dogs-" *Several growls behind her caught her attention.*

Scoldrant: *It reached out and violently dug its nails into Twortz's shoulder, causing her to yelp in pain.* "Growlgrrrh!"

Twortz: *She attempted to sway her hand over her shoulder, trying to release her violin.* (I can't move my arm back with its claws-)

*Twortz attempted to sway her free arm, causing her body to glow a shade of blue.*

Twortz: "Sonic Rush-" *She swayed her arm and nothing happened.* "What?!"

Lezard: *He watched Twortz from the screen with a serious face.* "She's only been practising using the Neurons in her right arm, she merely needs to train in both."

Karol: "Th-That doesn't make sence."

Lezard: "If you only practice writing with your right hand, it's hard to write with your left, isn't it?"

Karol: "Yh-Yheah.." *He looked down.* "That does make sence."

Twortz: *She watched another three Scoldrants lurk towards her from the shadows.* (I-I'm surrounded?!)

*Twortz hesitantly reached towards her number, as if she was ready to rip it off.*

Twortz: (Tsst-)

*Six arrows suddenly shot through the air and jabbed into each Scoldrants, suddenly exploding into boulders of ice.*

Luna: *She stood at the bottom of the spiral stairs and kept her shooting pose, taking deep breaths.* "Gah..." *She sniffed and lowered the bow, ignoring three slash marks on the side of her neck.*

Twortz: "L-Lighten?" *She squirmed as the Scoldrant collapsed to the floor, ripping its claws out of her shoulder.*

Luna: "You fuckin' bitch!"

Twortz: (I wasn't expecting her to-)

Luna: *She stormed up to Twortz and violently slapped her across the face.* "Thanks for savin' me, aye."

Twortz: "I-..."

Luna: "Save it, bitch." *She walked over the Scoldrant behind Twortz and touched the door with glowing frames, causing her body to ripple in the air.*

Twortz: *She slowly turned around and placed her hand on her shoulder, causing blood to run down her arm.* (Despite the blood, no vital veins were punctured-)

Karol: *He watched Twortz waddle up to the door and disappear in a ripple to the door's touch.* "Loona is alive!" *He sounded relieved.*

Lezard: "I don't know where we would be without that feisty little one either." *He implied he was relieved that Luna was okay.*

Karol: "Nee hee."

----------

*Trevour hobbled through the forest in an awkward-like jog manner, causing his armour to rattle.*

Trevour: *He noticed large spider webs in between the enormous trees.* "Just keep a sturdy mind frame. I can get there in the end-"

?????: "Hearkct!" *A human-sized spider with long thin black legs, crawled along a path of webs in the treetops.*

Trevour: *He looked up and spun around so get could get a better look at the Scoldrant.* "Oh dear, how temperamental!-"

Scoldrant: "Hearkct-" *It shot out a white web-like ball at Trevour.*

Trevour: "DUST STORM" *He swayed his hands, causing a tornado-like eruption of sand to swirl in front of him.*

*The web ball melted into the sand causing it to sizzle, as if it acted as acid.*

Trevour: (Is the sand burning? Maybe it knows fire?) *He quickly turned around and hobbled down the path.*

*A swarm of spider-like Scoldrants fell off the canopy and landed on the ground, causing it to slightly rumble.*

Trevour: (I can feel the vibrations-. I don't need to look back-) *He thought to himself in determination and quickly hobbled to the side, watching web-like balls shoot past him.*

Scoldrants: "Hearkct." *Several hiss-like screeches echoed in the distance.*

Trevour: "The aurora lights bend and swirl the gravel into liquid, turn to dust and sand, watch it vacuum your sins-" *He clapped his hands and held them, focusing on the ground.*

Scoldrant: *It swung upside on a thick web, extending its legs towards Trevour's back.* "Hearkct."

Trevour: "SWIRLING SANDPIT" *He quickly punched the ground and awkwardly ran forward without losing speed.*

Scoldrant: *It drooled a green liquid, as if it was excited to bite into Trevour.* "Hearkctt-"

Trevour: "DUST STORM" *He spoke with obvious fear and punched down then upwards, causing a swirling vortex of sand to hit the swinging Scoldrant off its web.*

*The other Scoldrants stepped into the softening ground and stopped, struggling to raise their legs out of the quicksand.*

Trevour: *He noticed a door with glowing frames further ahead, causing him to smile with hope.* "Almost-"

Woman: "Help!" *She screamed at Trevour who ran past her.*

Trevour: *He looked to his side, noticing the woman entangled in a human-sized web.* "Miss?"

Woman: "Please help!"

Trevour: *He looked behind him, noticing the swarm of following spiders.* (I won't be able to-)

*Trevour continued to run ahead, focusing his attention to the door with glowing frames.*

Trevour: (Sorry, miss!-)

Woman: "Please.. P-P-Pl-ease!"

Trevour: (How temperamental-) *He closed his eyes, triggering a flashback.*

----------

*A younger version of Trevour slowly sunk in quicksand.*

Trevour: "Help, please, brothers!"

*A slightly older version of Trevour folded his arms, staring at Trevour in disgust.*

Trevour: "Please, brother!"

?????: "You've been different, your Rostical.. It's pathetic-"

Trevour: "Alan?!" *He slapped the sand, causing it to splash like water.*

Alan: "Even your own powers have turned against you."

Trevour: "I'm your younger brother?!"

*Another man in thick brown armour ran into the clearing, instantly noticing Trevour.*

Trevour: "Felipe!" *He coughed and gagged, as if he was struggling to keep his head above the sand.*

Felipe: "What's happening, Alan? Why is our younger brother in quicksand?"

Alan: "Don't look at me. He's the weak one that can manipulate sand."

Felipe: "So, he did this to himself?"

Alan: "Yeah.. He tried to prove himself by manipulating solid rock."

Felipe: "..." *He folded his arms and watched Trevour continue to sink to neck level.*

Alan: "You're a disgrace to our family."

Trevour: "F-Felipe?"

Felipe: "Let's go, Alan."

Trevour: "... Brothers?" *He stopped struggling, as he sunk past his neck.*

Alan: "We have the strongest ground-based Rostical Using blood through our veins.. Yet, you control sand and dirt? You are no brother of mine."

Trevour: *He lifted his head, as the sand started to pour into his mouth.* "B-But, I'll die?"

*Alan and Felipe slowly walked back into the forest and out of Trevour's vision.*

Trevour: "No-"

?????: "Brother-" *A girl walked into the clearing, wearing thick brown armour.*

Trevour: "Rosemary?"

Rosemary: *She shook her head and kicked the ground, causing an enormous platform to erupt up.* "ROCK PILLAR"

Trevour: "Ah?!" *The sand pulsed and started to stream on the edges of the platform.*

Rosemary: "Trevour."

Trevour: "Much appreciated, sister."

Rosemary: "I think it's time you left the clan."

Trevour: "B-But?"

Rosemary: "Me and your two brothers have almost unlocked the second potential of the ground affinity.. You're still stuck on even manipulating solid ground.."

Trevour: *He slowly stood up, causing sand to stream off his body.* "I know-"

Rosemary: "I love you, my brother. But, for your own good.."

Trevour: *His eyes started to water.* "I-"

Rosemary: "I won't be around all the time to help you.. If I wasn't around this time-"

Trevour: "I would've died.."

Rosemary: *She turned around and the ground cracked in a circular motion around her.* "I say this because I care.. You're too nice, Trevour."

*The ground started to float underneath Rosemary, lifting her off the ground.*

Trevour: "..."

Rosemary: *She started to float high into the treetops, causing leaves to spiral down to the ground.* "You need to find your own happiness before you can hope to achieve ours."

Trevour: "Rosemary-"

Rosemary: "For now, I hope not to see you."

Trevour: *He looked up, watching Rosemary float away on the piece of rock.* (I can't-)

----------

Trevour: *He frowned with watering eyes and hesitantly turned around, hopping to each side, avoiding three leaping spiders.* "If she wasn't there to save me, I would've died!"

*Trevour shouted and ran towards the woman, ignoring parts of his armour which melted away from strings of web.*

Trevour: "DUST STORM-" *He went to punch the ground and a string of web wrapped itself around his arm, stopping him in his movements.*

Woman: "W-What have I done?" *She whispered on her breath, watching the spiders wrap Trevour in spirals of web from the bottom up.* "R-Run, if you can, run!"

Trevour: "How can I protect you if I can't even use solid ground?!"

Woman: "Just run!"

Trevour: *The woman's screams echoed in his mind, triggering desperation.* "I can't do anything.."

Scoldrant: *It slowly crawled on top of Trevour and revealed its long sword-like teeth, readying to bite Trevour.* "Hearkctt!"

Woman: (The poison will kill him!-) "Remove your number!-"

Trevour: *He unintentionally scrunched his fingers, as if he was about to scratch his way out of the cocoon.* "DIRTCLOUD TALONS"

Woman: *She closed her eyes and looked up, quivering in fear.* "May the Astragons bless us-"

*Scratch-like strings of sand ripped open the cocoon around Trevour and ripped the Scoldrant's legs off.*

Trevour: *He hobbled up to the woman and scratched downwards, slashing the web with strings of sand.* "DIRTCLOUD TALONS"

Woman: "H-Huh-?" *She collapsed into Trevour's arms.*

Trevour: "What's your name, madam?"

Woman: "H-Hayward."

Trevour: "DUST STORM" *He spoke in determination and ignored a spiral of sand which erupted around him, cutting the Scoldrant's legs.*

Hayward: *She looked down, staring at the twitching spider legs in shock.* "Wow-"

Trevour: "The movement on the ground-" *He spoke to himself before focusing his attention to Hayward.* "Can you run?"

Hayward: *She looked at Trevour, ignoring the tornado-like swirl of sand around them.* "Yes." *She nodded her head, regaining her composure.*

Scoldrant: *It raised its four front legs in an aggressive-like manner and jumped into the swirling sand, causing its legs to cut off.* "Hearcktt!-"

Trevour: "Let's go!-" *He swayed his arm, causing an opening in the swirling sand.*

Hayward: "Eeek." *She sprinted towards the door with glowing frames.*

Trevour: *He hobbled after Hayward and continuously swayed his hands back, throwing streams of sand from his fingernails behind him.* "DIRTCLOUD TALONS"

Hayward: *She ran into reaching distance to the door and faced Trevour, causing strings of web to flick off her body, revealing a blue silk moon-like robe.* "Thank you!-"

Trevour: "DIRTCLOUD TALONS" *He scrunched his fingers and scratched streams of sand into several spiders from his fingertips, causing their bodies to explode.*

Hayward: *She brushed web out of her hair, revealing moon and star hair ornaments.* "Thank you, whoever you are!" *She touched the door and suddenly faded up in a ripple.*

Trevour: "It's-" *He started to pant and quickly touched the door, queuing him to fade into a warping ripple.* "Trevour-"

Lezard: *He clapped his hands in excitement.* "Wowza.. Our heroes did it.."

Karol: "Bearly." *He sounded worried, causing Lezard to chuckle.*

Lezard: "Barely? More than sixty percent of the participants failed-"

Grey: "Everyone has now passed on to the next Reality Marble!" *He spoke with a proud voice, watching the screens suddenly change scenario, causing several spectators to run across the room.*

*Nathan and Rachael found themselves on a large mountain under a full moon.*

Nathan: "There's nothing?"

?????: "Nothin'?"

Rachael: "Hey." *She spoke with a smile and turned around, looking at Luna.* "Luna!"

Luna: "'Sup?"

Destiny: "Yeup."

Nathan: *He observed the area around him.* "Where do we go?"

Luna: "Yea, we're on a big hill, I dunno which way to go, aye-"

*All their numbers started to beep, causing the party to jog in a small circle.*

Rachael: "He said to keep running forward."

Luna: "There's nothin' below this mountain-like hill."

Destiny: "Yeup!" *She meowed for confirmation, giving the impression they already checked.*

*A man with fresh bloody cuts started to run up the mountain, catching the party's attention.*

Rachael: "Are you okay?"

Man: "Yeah.. I was a little put off by this Reality Marble.. The objective is to stand your ground."

Nathan: "From what?"

Man: "A swarm of Scoldrants!"

Rachael: "What's your name?"

Lezard: *He clicked his fingers and pointed at the screen, catching Karol's attention.* "Hey, it's a male version of the woman Trevour saved-"

Man: "Skyward." *He scratched his head, unintentionally wiping blood on his sun and star hair ornaments.*

Lezard: "Ooo-" *He squealed in defeat.* "Close! I was going to say Manward."

Karol: "Uhm?"

Nathan: "Are you a fighter?"

Skyward: *He shook his head.* "By myself, I can't.."

Nathan: "If we have to defend ourselves from a swarm, stand in the middle of us!"

Skyward: "Sure." *He quickly jogged with a limp in the middle of Rachael, Luna and Nathan.*

Nathan: *He continued to jog in a circle, firmly holding his grip onto the sword with anticipation.* (Where are they? What are they?)

Luna: "Pssht, come out already, aye!"

Rachael: "Piercing Land." *She raised her leg and kicked the ground, causing two boulders to erupt near her face.*

Luna: "Huh?"

Rachael: *She punched the rocks, causing them to take the shape of daggers.* "I'm ready-" *She grabbed the daggers and continued to jog around Skyward.*

Destiny: "Y-Yeup!" *She alerted Luna.*

Luna: "Gotcha-" *She suddenly raised the bow and pulled the string, firing off an arrow into the night sky.*

Rachael: *She looked up, staring in the direction where the arrow fired off.* "I don't see any-?"

?????: "Eeeeeep." *A bat-like screech could be heard, followed by an explosion of ice.*

Luna: "Aha-"

Rachael: "You got something!"

Skyward: "Don't underestimate them! There's too many to handle!-"

Nathan: "Air Slash." *He swayed the sword up into the night sky and watched four bat-like Scoldrants fall on to the ground.*

Rachael: "How?"

Skyward: "I think they have a little Astragon control! It allows them to mask their presence if they aren't attacking.." *He hopped to each side, ensuring his number wouldn't start beeping.*

Luna: (Destiny can sense these shits anyways, but they appear before they're going to attack-?)

Rachael: *She suddenly noticed a swarm of bats flapping around her, causing her to react in a karate-like manner.* "Ha!"

*Rachael jabbed a stone dagger into a bat and spun around kicking another onto the ground.*

Luna: "Pssht-" *She flicked the bow, blasting an arrow into three bats, causing her to chuckle in an impressed-like manner.*

Skyward: "Wow, you pierced three of them!"

Luna: "Pssht, I know." *She smirked and sniffed her finger in a victorious-like manner.*

Rachael: *She kneed a bat and leant to the side, stabbing it in the head with a dagger.* "Rock Pillar." *She punched up, causing a sharp pillar of rock to erupt behind her, jabbing into a bat.*

Nathan: "Double Slash." *He waved the sword to each side at incredible speeds, watching two bats slice in half.*

Hayward: *She watched fluoro orange blood ooze out of the bats.* "Amazing swordsmanship-"

Luna: *She felt the arrows in the container over her shoulder.* (Shit, I've only got five more!-)

Rachael: *She spun around, purposely slashing off the bat's wings, causing them to helplessly fall to the ground.* "There's still many remaining, but we got this!"

----------

*Trevour stepped forward, noticing he stood in a large desert.*

Trevour: *He slowly scanned across, admiring the canyon sized desert.* "Wow-"

?????: "Even something, without life, can be so beautiful."

Trevour: "Madam-?" *He turned around, staring at Twortz.* "I mean Twortz."

Twortz: "There were three others before you.. They voluntarily took off their numbers.. It's very hot and I couldn't see a door at all.." *She pointed behind her to a set of footsteps, leading to the highest sand hill.*

Trevour: "Heh heh. Lucky you got me." *He focused his attention ahead and suddenly kicked downwards, causing a pulse of sand to travel into the distance.*

Twortz: "What are you doing?"

Trevour: "I focused my Neurons and released a pulse of Astragons.. I will be able to detect anything that's on the surface."

Twortz: *She smirked in realisation.* "Just like a door."

Trevour: "Precisely, heh heh."

Twortz: *She noticed parts of Trevour's armour had warped, similar to burnt plastic.* "What happened to you?"

Trevour: "Me? Don't worry about it-" *He smiled and looked to his side, staring out into the distance.* "This will be very easy."

Twortz: "Have you actually found it?"

Trevour: "Yes. This way." *He smiled and hobbled down a large sand hill, ignoring sandy gusts of wind.*

Twortz: (Excellent.) *She thought to herself in relief, wiping the sweat which poured off her face.*

----------

*Rachael, Nathan, Luna and Destiny panted in exhaustion, staring at a bat covered floor.*

Skyward: "You all managed to take them all out." *He spoke in amazement and noticed a door spiral down from the sky, landing in front of the party.*

Luna: "How convenient.. Just like a bloody game, aha." *She shook her head, staring at the door with glowing frames.*

Destiny: "Yeup?"

Luna: "Like wat, are we going to enter an industrial city next? With metal bendin' creatures? Pssht." *She smirked and stepped over the bats, making her way towards the door.*

Rachael: *She wiped her forehead and smiled, dropping the dagger shaped rocks.* "That's what I call a workout."

Nathan: *He held the sword with his left hand, allowing him to stretch his right wrist.* "To our next one." *He sniffed and walked towards the door, watching Luna fade up, leaving a ripple in the air.*

Rachael: "Skyward?"

Skyward: *He nodded his head with a smile.* "Coming."

Lezard: "Naww. Razzypoo, our man Nathan and the new addition to the family, stepped into their third Reality Marble."

Karol: "What about Loona?"

Lezard: "She already left, you silly sausage."

Karol: *He giggled at the way Lezard describes his words.* "Their fird.. They've got tooh more left?"

Lezard: "Well, three more including the next one."

Karol: "Ah-"

Lezard: "And-" *He looked to another screen, watching Trevour and Twortz stand at another door in an empty desert.* "They've almost done too."

Twortz: *She stood at the door and looked behind her, staring at two sets of footprints leading into the distance.* "This was too easy."

Trevour: "On the contrary, Twortz. What would you have done if I couldn't detect its location?"

Twortz: *She smiled and nodded her head in appreciation.* "Good point."

Trevour: "Ladies first?" *He stepped to the side and waved Twortz to the door.*

Twortz: "Hmph." *She placed her hands behind her back and cupped them, walking up to the door in a professional-like manner.*

Trevour: *He watched Twortz's image fade upwards, leaving behind a ripple.* (I wonder what's in store for us next?) *He touched the door, causing the area to blur around him.*

----------

*Rachael stepped forward and listened to steam-like hisses and mechanical clanks.*

Rachael: "Huh?" *She looked up, noticing she stood deep inside a massive industrial area.*

Luna: "Well.. This is awkward." *She stepped forward, staring at massive metallic poles.*

Rachael: "It's still night."

Nathan: *He wiped fluoro orange blood off his sword.* "How is it that their blood glows in the dark?"

?????: "Probably Astragon related, sir."

Rachael: *She gasped with a smile.* "Trevour!"

Trevour: "Heh heh, hello, everyone!"

Luna: *She felt her arrows, causing her to frown.* (I've only got one left..)

Nathan: *His number started to beep, causing him to walk forward noticing a change in tone of his footsteps.* "The ground? It's metallic?"

Luna: "I know. You can tell by how it slightly mirrors your image."

Trevour: "Oh really?" *He quickly looked down, staring at a dark metallic ground.* "I can't see anything?"

Luna: "Me neither."

Nathan: "Ha ha." *He quickly hid his laughter and looked away.*

Trevour: "Ah, did it again, heh heh."

Rachael: "Hmm.." *She looked worried.*

Nathan: "What's wrong?"

Rachael: "The ground, I can't feel anything."

Trevour: "Yes. It's a little disorientating at first when you start to rely on the ground."

*Metallic footprints clinked off distance poles, catching the party's attention.*

Luna: *She noticed the party look at her, causing her to shrug her shoulders.* "Don't look at me. I didn't fart, aye."

Trevour: "No, your vision, madam."

Luna: "Oh-..." *She scanned the area with her sketch-like vision and noticed metallic spider Scoldrants move like crabs out of her vision.* "Aye?"

Rachael: "What do you see?"

Luna: "They were like robots."

Trevour: "Rhobots?"

Rachael: "They're like Rosterology devices that move on their own accord."

Nathan: (Damn. More enemies-)

Trevour: "Barring Lezard and Karol, looks like everyone but Twortz is here-"

Luna: "Twotters? Pssht." *She frowned in anger and stormed ahead, listening to her metallic footsteps.*

Trevour: *He looked up, staring at enormous machinery in the distance.* (Astounding-)

----------

Grey: *He focused his attention on Rachael's party, observing the scenery in a curious-like manner, causing him to touch his throat.* "What kind of area is that, Ordin? Please respond."

Ordin: *He touched his throat, shaking his head.* "Some Reality Marbles are actually part of the contestant's own memory."

Grey: "I see."

----------

*Twortz took a step forward and found herself in a beautiful green lakeside, watching the sunlight dance off the crystal clear yellow lake.*

Twortz: "Yellow?" *She took several steps towards the lake, noticing cuts on her arm slowly heal.*

*Twortz stared at her arm in amazement, causing her to slowly waddle closer to the lake.*

Twortz: "This lake seems to have healing properties?" *She smiled and casually sat down by the lake, placing her arms in the water.*

*Twortz splashed the water on her shoulder, watching it heal with red glittering light.*

Twortz: "Marvellous. The rewards for my hard work, perhaps?"

Man: *He angrily pointed at the screen with Twortz and glared at Grey, who continued to sit in his chair on the floating glyph.* "Why has that woman got an easy Reality Marble?"

Ordin: *He stepped forward.* "Not all Reality Marbles are necessarily bad."

Man: "That's not fair!"

Ordin: "It is all random based-"

Man: "I want my money back! I lost a massive bet because of these random-"

Grey: "Are you questioning not only The Agoura Marbles, but the way I run things in my own city?" *He purposely cut the man off in mid-sentence.*

Man: "...-"

Grey: "Please respond?"

Man: *He suddenly looked down in fear.* "My apologies, your majesty."

Karol: "It wasn't vewy nice what Tworts did wif Loona."

Lezard: "Indeed, little one." *He watched the party walk through the metallic city with a serious face.* "There was something father and mother monster used to tell me.."

Karol: "Yheah?"

Lezard: "Do you know that empty feeling inside your chest? Or are you too young to understand what I mean?"

Karol: *He placed both hands on his chest.* "No.. I know the feeling..."

Lezard: "There's a way to fill that empty feeling." *He focused his attention to another screen, watching Twortz stare at her own reflection.*

Karol: "Wezard?"

Lezard: "Friends.."

Karol: "Fwends?"

Lezard: "I still don't really understand what it means, but the point I'm trying to say-"

Karol: "Is to be fwends?"

Lezard: "Bwarharh.. Just.. Don't treat people like a second option when you're their first."

Karol: "I dhon't get it?"

Lezard: *He shook his head.* "Let's focus on the games, little one."

----------

Luna: *She dragged her feet, sighing in an annoyed-like manner.* "Gah, this place is effin' huge.."

Nathan: "Thanks for stating the obvious."

Trevour: "I think she was implying about finding the door, sir."

Luna: "Yea, dipshit."

Nathan: "Hmph." *He grunted at Luna while keeping his focus on his surroundings.*

Rachael: *She walked around a corner and triggered an unnoticeable thin red laser around her ankle.* "Just stick to the rules, let's keep moving."

Trevour: "Heh heh. I couldn't agree more."

Luna: (Lame-)

Destiny: "Yeu?" *She hopped around and stared at a stack of poles behind Luna.*

Luna: "Whoa! Freaky lookin' behind you when you're still starin' in front-"

Nathan: "Huh?" *His sudden attention caused Rachael to look curious.*

Rachael: "What's wrong?"

Nathan: "Don't you know a thing about your own Scoldrant? She's obviously picked up something-"

Luna: "Don't tell me what I do and don't know-"

*Robotic-like beeps interrupted Luna in mid-sentence, causing the entire party to slowly turn around.*

Luna: "Aye?"

Rachael: *She squinted her eyes.* "It's hard to tell with it being night-"

Luna: "And everythin' lookin' the same!"

Trevour: *He noticed the poles vibrate, causing him to look slightly worried.* "I think we should leave, everyone."

Nathan: "Why? What's the problem?"

Trevour: "I have a bad feeling, sir."

Nathan: "And?"

Trevour: "Because I actually care about your well-being."

Luna: "Naww, save the corny shit for later!" *She grunted and frowned, staring at a gigantic spider-like robot.* "We gotta problem, aye."

Trevour: *He scanned the area, shaking his head.* "Where-?"

Rachael: *She noticed LED lights turn on, revealing the robot's location.* "What is that?"

Trevour: "A-A Scoldrant?"

Nathan: "No way."

Trevour: "A massive Rosterology device?"

Luna: "Just bloody run!"

Destiny: "Yeup!"

Trevour: "Maybe it's friendly-?"

Machine: "Eee-oo-boarp-" *It suddenly fired two laser beams at the party and sliced a nearby pole, causing it to snap off.*

Trevour: *He watched the pole larger than him hit the ground, causing the metallic floor to warp.* "How situational, retreat!"

Rachael: (Oh no-) "Rock Pillar." *She punched upwards and noticed nothing happened.* (Again?!)

Luna: "Rachael, you dumb bitch-" *She grunted in an annoyed-like manner and grabbed her hand, before running away.*

Rachael: *She awkwardly turned around and started to run, pulled by Luna.* "Thanks."

Nathan: *He ran down a maze-like path made of metallic poles and took a sharp turn, causing the party to slide around the corner.* "It might be large, but it's slow to attack-"

*Two laser beams shined behind the party and artificial sparks exploded off a metallic wall.*

Rachael: "We're lucky it's got really bad aiming."

Trevour: *He started to breathe heavily.* "I'm.. I'm really tired."

Luna: "Yea.."

Rachael: *She ran at the front with Nathan.* "You're able to keep up though, Luna."

Luna: "I'm a good long distance runner."

Rachael: "You? Really?"

Luna: "Yea?"

Rachael: "I just didn't expect it-" *She jogged out of the maze and spun around, finding herself in a building sized factory.*

Nathan: "Whatever that advanced Rosterology creature was, it's gone."

Trevour: "Kerr-" *He dropped to his knees, causing his armour to rattle.*

Nathan: "Get up-"

Destiny: "Yeup!"

Rachael: *She looked back, frowning in desperation.* "We need to keep moving."

Luna: "Th-There's heaps of them little shits-" *She listened to hundreds of small metallic footsteps coming from every direction.*

Nathan: (Darn it-) *He mumbled in an annoyed-like manner and picked Trevour up with one hand, before continuing on.*

Trevour: "Sir?" *He sounded shocked.*

Nathan: "You have to start working out."

Trevour: "I do workout. I train my manipulation skills every day-"

Nathan: "I'm not talking about Rostical-" *He looked up and noticed a door with glowing frames on the top floor.* "Look!"

Rachael: "How are we meant to get up there?"

Luna: "Anyone an Airbender?"

Destiny: "Yeup?"

Nathan: "I don't see any stairs or a mode of transportation-"

Rachael: *She noticed a different coloured platform with a small control panel.* "An elevator!"

Trevour: *He watched Rachael run towards the platform.* "Ele-?"

Luna: "Don't worry, aye." *She grunted and started to run after Rachael, causing Nathan and Trevour to follow.*

Rachael: "Awesome!" *She smiled in relief and pressed several buttons on the control panel, causing the elevator to activate.* "Everyone, get on."

Luna: *She noticed the controls activate.* "How?"

Rachael: *She looked at Luna with a proud smile.* "It's the same in design from my dad's paintballing company."

Luna: "Kool-"

Trevour: *He watched the platform raise and took the opportunity to rest, causing his number to start beeping.* "This sure takes a lot out of a man."

Nathan: "Quit complaining."

Trevour: *He swayed to each side, causing his number to stop beeping.* "I'm sorry, sir."

Luna: "Pssht, apologetic pushover-"

*Several metallic spiders dived down from the ceiling and landed on the rising platform.*

Luna: "Shit!-"

Nathan: "Hah!" *He quickly reacted to the robotic-like creatures and jumped into striking distance, raising the sword.* "Double Slash."

*Nathan skilfully swayed his arm and slashed the sword to each side, slicing the robots into pieces.*

Luna: (I don't wanna use my last arrow now-) *She grunted to herself in thought and stepped back, watching more robots fall from the ceiling.*

Trevour: *He took deep exhausted breaths and punched the platform.* "DUST STORM"

*A swirl of sand erupted up from the platform in a tornado-like fashion, short-circuiting three robots.*

Rachael: "Hah!" *She punched up and noticed nothing happened.* "Huh?"

Luna: *She continued to step backwards.* (They're too close-)

Rachael: "Rock Pillar." *She spoke with determination and punched upwards, causing nothing to happen.* "What-?!"

Nathan: "This is what happens when you rely on Rostical too mu-"

Rachael: "Hah!" *She suddenly kicked a robot off the platform and spun around, uppercutting another robot.*

Nathan: "Ha." *He chuckled in respect and sliced another three robots with one swing of his sword.*

Rachael: *She spun around and swept a robot off its metallic feet, causing it to slide off the platform.* (We're up pretty high now.)

Lezard: *He clapped his hands and giggled at the screen.* "Luna and Destiny moved with such delicious evasive mannerisms, avoiding attacks while our heroes continue to defeat the herds.. Or is it swarms? Of metallic deaths!"

Karol: "They're nearlwy there."

Lezard: "How exciting." *He shook his bottom and accidentally knocked a plate from a woman's hand, causing it to shatter on the ground.*

Karol: *He jumped in fright.* "H-Holy Neurons!" *He glanced at the shattered pieces.*

Lezard: "I'm sincerely sorry-" *He watched the woman continue walking as if nothing happened.* "Jinkies, people are really into these games-"

Karol: "Wezard-" *He tugged on Lezard's arm.* "The meanie-" *He watched Twortz casually stroll down the lakeside.*

----------

Twortz: *She ate an apple and smelled the flowers which vibrantly bloomed in the area.* "Excellent. Every worker is entitled to a day off."

*Twortz smiled and made her way to a door with glowing frames, which stood at the end of the lake.*

Twortz: "A very peaceful Reality Marble. And I'm certain there's nothing stalking me.. I can just feel it." *She spoke to herself with a widening smile and licked her lips before taking another bite into the apple.*

*Twortz watched butterflies flap around her ankles, as she brushed past several flowers.*

Twortz: *She walked up to the door and sighed in a calming manner before touching it.* "Back to work."

----------

Nathan: *He jabbed his sword into the last moving robot and pulled it out, causing its machines to malfunction.* "Done."

*The elevator stopped at the top floor, causing the party to stare at the door with glowing frames in a victorious-like manner.*

Luna: "How convenient."

Rachael: "Everyone?" *She looked back to see if they were okay, ignoring her bruised knuckles.*

Nathan: "Trevour?"

Trevour: *He nodded his head.* "Thank you for the concern, everyone-"

Luna: "Everyone? Pssht, I'm not concerned." *She sniffed and walked up to the door before disappearing upwards in a ripple.*

Nathan: "She's got the competitive spirit." *He pushed Rachael and Trevour towards the door in a friendly-like manner.*

Lezard: *He watched the party all fade upwards in excitement.* "Yay! We're on our fourth one now!"

Karol: "Nee hee."

Lezard: "Hopefully it's sunny."

Karol: "I dhon't want to see that skcary place again."

Lezard: "With the lightning and the mansion?"

Karol: "Y-Yheah!"

*Lezard and Karol focused back to the spinning globe and noticed Rachael's number change colour, queuing them to quickly look at another screen.*

Lezard: (I wonder what it is now?)

----------

*Luna, Rachael, Trevour and Nathan found themselves on a small island, surrounded by the open sea.*

Trevour: *He looked up and squinted his eyes.* "At least it's day now, heh heh."

Luna: *She looked behind her, staring at a small tropical forest and several coconuts on the sand.* "Kool-"

Rachael: "This is a small island-" *She looked to each side able to see the ends of the island.* "You wouldn't think the door is here, right?"

Luna: "Unless if it's under the sea, I don't think so."

Nathan: "Look, over there-" *He pointed across the ocean, staring at another island.*

Luna: "Aye?"

Destiny: "Yeup?" *She stared into the distance and the purple ring around her iris spiralled, effectively magnifying her vision.*

Luna: "The door, I see it!"

Rachael: "Awesome!" *She stared into the distance and smiled, as if she was keen to start swimming.*

Trevour: *He stared at the water and shook his head.* "I can't swim very well."

Luna: "Huh? How can someone be bad at swimmin'?"

Destiny: "Yeu?"

Rachael: "Is it the armour?"

Trevour: "Negative, miss."

Nathan: "We'll help you."

Trevour: "But-"

Nathan: "We've almost reached the last Reality Marble, we might as well help each other out until we get to the last one."

Man: *He staggered out of the tropical forest and onto the sand, gasping at the party.* "Yurgk-"

Trevour: "Are you okay, sir?!"

Man: "D-Don't go into the water!"

Rachael: "Why?" *She looked back to the ocean.* "I don't see anything in it."

Man: "There's a Guardian somewhere in there."

Luna: "Hell to the no I'm gettin' in there then." *She folded her arms and shook her head.*

Man: "I've lost my party members due to that thing.. I can only pray to the Astragons they removed themselves from the game before-..." *He spoke with watering eyes and suddenly ripped his number, causing him to vanish upwards.*

Luna: "Bobby, beam me up?" *She placed an arm on her chest, looking up at the sky.*

Trevour: "There's no way I can do this, especially if there's a Guardian on the loose."

Rachael: "I'm a very good swimmer, I'll help you too."

Trevour: "It's my elemental affinity. I'm just, not very good with water-"

*A scattered shock wave blew against the party and slid them towards the water.*

Luna: "Gah-?!" *She looked down, watching the sand blow around her ankles.* "Wat's goin'-?"

*The shock wave intensified and blasted the party off the island and into the ocean.*

Destiny: (Yeup!) *She spiralled under the water, causing Luna to catch her in desperation.*

Luna: (Crap!-) *She held her breath and dog paddled towards the surface.*

Rachael: *She bobbed her head up and shook her head, flicking wet hair out of her face.* "What was that?"

Luna: "Kah-" *She gasped for air and frowned in disorientation.* "My ears hurt, aye-"

Nathan: *He gasped for breath and awkwardly placed his sword in its sheathe, allowing him to swim more freely.* "Trevour-?"

Trevour: "G-G-Garg-le-" *He awkwardly splashed above the surface and slapped the water, as if he was trying to stand above it.* "Can't-"

*A heartbeat-like pulse thumped through Luna, Destiny and Nathan's body, causing them to look into the far distance.*

Luna: "Somethin'-"

Nathan: "Is coming." *He spoke on his breath.*

Destiny: *She noticed several purple and green fins emerge out of the water, as a long snake-like tail slithered towards the party.* "Yeup! Yeup!"

Rachael: (It's obvious Trevour and myself can't use ground here-) *She gritted her teeth and swam towards Trevour, grabbing onto one of his arms.* "Nathan-"

Nathan: *He swam up to Trevour and grabbed his other arm.* "Let's go-"

Trevour: "Guys, please! I don't want to put you in any danger."

Rachael: "Swim on your back and kick your legs, remember to keep your head elevated."

Luna: (I can swim, but not very good-) *She doggy paddled close to the surface, causing small waves to splash against the back of her head, wetting Destiny.*

Destiny: "Hssst." *She hissed like a cat due to the water.*

Luna: "My bad."

Destiny: "Yeup!" *She stood on Luna's head and shook her body, trying to dry herself.*

Trevour: *He started to kick his legs and looked at Rachael and Nathan, admiring their hard efforts to swim him along.* (Rachael, Nathan-)

Luna: *She swam towards the other island, knowing the danger that swam towards them.* (Apparently this Guardian took out a whole party.. It's probably a generic sea snake that can shoot out white beams aha.)

Nathan: "I'm not sure where it is, but I don't think we'll reach the island in time."

Rachael: "We're about half way-"

?????: "Intruders!" *A three storey snake suddenly erupted out of the water and curled forward, glancing at the party.* "In my home!"

Luna: "I'm right again, shit-bitch-tits-"

Trevour: "Th-That must be the Guardian! Rachael, our abilities won't work here!-"

Guardian: "SOLAR FLARE" *It opened its mouth and suddenly blasted a white beam with a fluoro blue shading into the water next to the party, creating a large wave.*

Luna: "Right again!-" *She screamed in shock.*

*A large wave curled over the party and crashed on top of them, pushing them deep into the water.*

Rachael: *She coughed out bubbles and looked around, noticing light flicker on the surface.* (Up there-)

Luna: *She splashed above the surface and gasped for air, coughing out water.* "Swallowed some sea water, aye."

Destiny: "Yeupth!" *She sneezed and violently shook her body, shaking the water out of her fur.* "Yeu.."

Luna: "OK, we win the lottery and get saved by a flying machine!" *She looked up and observed the sky, as if she was waiting for something to happen.*

Guardian: *It hissed and opened its jaw further, causing a spiralling white glyph to materialise in front of it.* "SOLAR FLARE"

Luna: "Shit!-"

Trevour: "G-G-Garg!-, I made it-" *He spoke in accomplishment, struggling to keep himself afloat.*

Guardian: *It pushed forward, blasting a fluoro white beam past Luna.* "Drown!"

Trevour: "Is everyone o-?" *The beam shot into the water directly next to him, violently pushing him down in a sudden whirlpool created by the beam.*

Luna: "Shit, Trevour! Where's that flyin' ship?!"

Trevour: *He started to sink.* (No...) *He helplessly raised his arm, staring at the flickering surface above him.*

Nathan: *He suddenly grabbed onto Trevour's arm causing him to look surprised.* (If you go-, it'll just be me, a sarcastic weirdo and a kid-)

Trevour: *He looked at Nathan and slightly smiled.* (He's really going out of his way..-)

Nathan: *He started to sink, causing him to frown in desperation.* (He's not even trying to move-) *He frowned and started to kick harder.*

Trevour: "Leave me, sir.." *He motioned the words with his lips as he stared at Nathan with a sad-filled face, as he continued to slowly sink.*

Nathan: (Shit, his armour is too heavy-)

Rachael: *She grab hold of Trevour's other arm, causing him to look shocked.* "Nathan-" *She motioned his name with her mouth, causing bubbles to float up.*

Luna: *She awkwardly gasped for air, noticing Destiny shiver on her shoulder.* "Kool, I thought I felt your claws detach-"

?????: "How unprofessional." *A woman ran on the surface of the water, directly past Luna.*

Luna: "Twotters?" *She spoke with a dropping jaw, watching the water splash around Twortz's feet.* "The fuck?"

Twortz: "All about Astragon control, Lighten." *She smirked and made her way towards the other island.*

Luna: "Oi! Rachael, Nathan and Trevour are still down there!" *She pointed down at the water, intensely watching Twortz continue to run on the surface.* "If you can somehow stand on the water, then help us!-"

Twortz: "Unfortunately, I don't get paid to assist you."

Luna: "Are you for cereal?"

Twortz: "Yes.. I'm serious."

Luna: "Bitch."

Twortz: "And with this door-" *She stared at the door with glowing frames on the island.* "I should be able to reach the finale."

Luna: *She stared at Twortz's back, watching her jump over the waves.* "I don't believe it.."

Destiny: "Yeu.."

Twortz: (Okay, I'm just about near the island-) *She inhaled deeply and screamed out a Sonic Roar into the water, blasting her into the air.*

Luna: *She looked up, watching Twortz land heavily on the island.* (Surprised the island didn't shatter.)

Twortz: *She slowly stood up and looked at the door, smiling in excitement.* "The final door."

Luna: *She noticed bubbles on the surface, causing her to quickly look at Destiny in desperation.* "Dammit, we're goin' under, OK?"

Destiny: "Yeufft." *She meowed with a hiss, symbolising she didn't want to.*

Trevour: (I don't like to put my friends in danger.. Right now, I'm stopping them from reaching the next door-)

Rachael: (Trevour, kick your damn legs!) *She kept pointed at Trevour's feet.*

Luna: *She dived down and kicked her legs towards Trevour.* (There he is-)

Destiny: *She dug her claws into Luna's shoulder, watching Nathan and Rachael struggling to keep Trevour from sinking any further.* (Yeup..)

Luna: *She grabbed Trevour by the hair and suddenly blew out bubbles, as if she wasn't expecting him to be so heavy.* (You fucking fat shit, let's go.)

Trevour: (Even Luna-?!)

Guardian: *It dived into the water and started to slither around the party.* "You're in my domain, my home, my territory!"

Nathan: (It can speak in the water.)

Trevour: (This is the best I can do for you, my friends-) *He slipped his hands out of Rachael and Nathan's grip and tilted his head, causing his hair to slip through Luna's fingertips.*

Luna: (Aye?)

Trevour: *He waved his arms upwards, promoting his sinking.* (Okay.. Trevour, let's do this for your new friends-)

Rachael: (He's touched the bottom-) *She watched Luna and Nathan swim back up for air.*

Guardian: "You will not make it out-"

Trevour: (DIRTCLOUD TALONS) *He tucked his arms in and suddenly spread them, causing strings of sand from the ocean's bed to swirl towards the Guardian.*

Rachael: (Sand?)

Guardian: "AQUA LIQ-"

*Scratch-like streams of sand hit the Guardian in the underbelly, exploding into sinking dirt clouds.*

Rachael: *She looked down, staring at Trevour.* (Trevour-)

Trevour: "Go!-" *He motioned the word with his lips and waved his hands away, implying for Rachael to continue.*

Rachael: (Thank you.) *She started to swim up towards the surface and gasped for air, noticing Nathan and Luna ready to dive back down.* "Let's go."

Nathan: "What about-?"

Rachael: "He's buying us time!" *Several explosions erupted out of the water.*

Luna: "Shit, underwater missiles?! Wat else does this effin' snake have?!"

Nathan: "We owe him." *He spoke in a deep voice and started to swim towards the island.*

Trevour: *He watched the party's shadow swim towards the island with a smile.* (DIRTCLOUD TALONS)

*Trevour scrunched his fingers and scratched the water where the Guardian was, causing the streams of sand to explode on the side of the Guardian.*

Guardian: "I will use Grand Rostical on you!" *It suddenly spiralled onto the ocean's floor and blue glyphs started to spiral around it.*

Trevour: (Sorry to break your plans.) *He smiled and proudly placed his hands on his number, effectively ripping it.*

*Rachael, Nathan, Luna and Destiny made it on the island and looked back to watch a massive explosion erupt from the sea.*

Rachael: *She gasped due to the size of the explosion.* "I hope he.."

Nathan: "He may be a warrior, but he's smart."

Luna: "Yea-"

Twortz: "Hahahackee." *She faced the party, watching it suddenly rain down on them.* "I wanted to see if you made it-"

Luna: "Shut the fuck up, bitch-"

Rachael: "Twortz?"

Nathan: "How long have you been here-?"

Luna: "She was able to run on the water. She left without us."

Nathan: (She's acquired the level of Astragon control to walk on water? Why is her power growth different from the other's?)

Rachael: "Is this true?"

Twortz: "Yes."

Rachael: ".. Why?" *She spoke, as if she was hurt.*

Twortz: "All that is needed, is for one of us to complete these trivial little games. Then we can get the answers we seek. Isn't it a little unrealistic to think we all could win?"

Nathan: (She has a point.)

Twortz: "See you soon, Rachael and friends." *She touched the door without hearing their response, causing her body to warp upwards, leaving a ripple in the air.*

Rachael: (Twortz..)

Luna: "Pssht-" *She frowned and ran towards the door, quickly touching it.*

Nathan: *He stood up straight, watching it continue to pour down on them.* (Is it raining? No-, it's the Rasticsplash from that massive explosion.)

*Yellow monkeys jumped out of the dampening sand around the party, circling around them.*

Nathan: *He glanced at the constantly moving monkeys with a frown, placing his hand on his sword.* "It's just us two."

Rachael: "Why can't we work together?!" *She screamed and punched the sand, causing a visible ripple to pulse around her fist.*

Nathan: "Huh-?" *He swayed to each side, as if he endured a miniature quake.*

Rachael: *She watched all the surrounding monkeys trip backwards, all landing on their backs.* "Let's go!" *She sprinted towards the door and touched it.*

Nathan: *He smirked in respect and jumped over a monkey before touching the door.* (She's actually a good leader-)

Lezard: "What an exciting match-"

?????: "It certainly was, sir."

Karol: *He gasped with a childish grin, quickly looking to his side.* "Twevour?!"

Trevour: "Heh heh."

Lezard: "Ooo, welcome back my delicious monster." *He giggled, wiggling his bottom to each side.*

Trevour: "I was able to escape before the Guardian's Grand Rostical touched me."

Lezard: "A water based Grand Remenistal on, or even in the water.. I don't want to think what could've happened."

Grey: "It appears only six contestants have made it through to the final Reality Marble!"

*Grey shouted with a proud voice, queuing all the screens to connect into one, forming a massive cinema-like screen in the hallway.*

Trevour: "Only six remain?" *He focused his attention to a large green stadium, watching Luna, Rachael and Nathan warp onto it.*

Rachael: *She tapped her foot on the grass.* "It's synthetic."

Luna: "Aye?"

Rachael: "It's fake."

Luna: "It looks like a football field."

Nathan: "Where's Twortz?"

Grey: *He placed his hand on his throat.* "The contestants have reached the final area. Proceed to meet them on the podium."

*Grey looked confused and touched his throat again due to the lack of response.*

Grey: "Please respond?"

Ordin: *He looked shocked, quickly touching his throat.* "I don't detect her Neuron signature!"

Grey: "Inconceivable? Is there something wrong with the glyphic communicators?"

Ordin: "Not at all, your majesty."

Grey: "Then.."

Ordin: "The only other explanation is-" *He spoke with a sorrowful tone.*

Grey: "It's not logical.. She's the best lieutenant of my imperial warriors. She was the best suited to be the opponent of this year's champion."

Ordin: "Then, there must be a disturbance in a Reality Marble. She was captain levelled."

Grey: *He nodded his head.* "That has to be it."

*A woman dressed in blue and white armour dropped to the ground, covered in her own blood.*

Zazark: *He smirked and ripped out a metallic pole from the woman's neck, causing more blood to pump out.* "Fufufu.. The finale-"

*Twortz suddenly waddled onto the podium and stared at Zazark's back.*

Twortz: "Have I completed these trivial games?"

Zazark: "Trivial? Fufufu." *He smirked and slowly turned around, revealing specks of blood all over his face.*

Twortz: *She frowned and quickly reached over her shoulder, causing sparks to scatter around her violin.* "Am I the second person here?"

Zazark: "No, she was already here waiting-"

?????: "Actually, you were the third." *He suddenly stepped next to Twortz.*

Twortz and Zazark: "Who are you?" *They stared at the man, observing his different shades of brown armour.*

?????: *He glanced at Zazark in disgust.* "The man with the spiky hair is not part of the games."

Trevour: "A-Alan?" *He spoke in shock, intensely staring at the screen with widening eyes.*

Zazark: "It doesn't matter who you are, I don't like that calm attitude of yours! It's like, you don't even know the danger that stands before you-"

*A sharp piece of ground erupted up, slicing Zazark's face.*

Zazark: *He stumbled back in terror, watching his blood quickly run down his chin.* (A ground user-)

Alan: "Are you going to play or use your unique weapon?" *He spoke in a calm manner, glancing at Twortz, before focusing back to Zazark.*

Twortz: (So, he's currently an ally. I'll team up, then defeat him after-) *She clipped out a small dagger from the violin and started to play.*

Alan: "Play something, more upbeat." *He smirked and started to run towards Zazark.* "ROCK PILLAR"

Zazark: *His eyes flashed an orange glyph, causing him to smirk.* "ROCK PILLAR"

*Alan and Zazark kicked the ground, causing two spiked pillars of rock to collide into each other, exploding into a pulse of pebbles.*

Alan: "You're a ground user too?"

Zazark: "Fufufu-" *He suddenly appeared behind Alan and kicked him in the back of his leg, causing him to bend backwards.*

Alan: "Ah-?!"

Zazark: "Unlike my other party members, I don't have a seal weakening my power!-"

Twortz: "Sonic Rush." *She swayed around and blew the violin, blasting a scattered shock wave at Zazark.*

Zazark: *He suddenly jumped off Alan and flipped in the air, landing out of Twortz's attack.* "Fufufu."

Alan: "You don't know who I am, do you?" *He stood up straight and faced Zazark with a smirk.* "I'm a member of The Blazing Trio."

Lezard: "The Blazing Trio? Holy fish-cakes, that's one of the top guilds!-"

Trevour: "..."

Karol: "Bwazing? Why is his guild called bwazing if he used ground?"

Lezard: "Also. If The Black Brigade is meant to be a secret, why do they have a world known guild?"

Karol: "I dhon't know."

Twortz: (I learnt how to do this, that night, when Millard taught me how to harness my power.. I think it's finally time I use it-)

Zazark: "The fire trio? I'm a member of The Black Brigade." *He smirked back at Alan while slowly placing his hand on a silver whip which hung off his thigh.* "Fufufu."

Alan: "Heh heh-" *He jumped forward and glanced at Twortz.*

Zazark: "Fu?" *He looked to his side, watching a string of visible sound hit him on the side, causing a bone to loudly crack, followed by a chord of violins.*

Twortz: "Sacred scores, Lymph's Wave."

Zazark: *He slid across the podium and stopped with a confident smirk.* "You're weak, but your attacks are far stronger than you should be!-"

Alan: "There're two opponents here! Might, strength, fury, courage, form these emotions in array of mighty pillars-" *He punched his fists together, pushing them towards Zazark.*

Zazark: *He stepped back and avoided another stream of visible sound, listening to its faint echoing violin-like sound.* "ROCK PILLAR-"

Alan: "GROUND SHAKING" *He watched a line of different shaped rocks erupt towards Zazark.*

Zazark: *He punched forward and a rock pillar shot up in front of Alan's rock pillars.* "Fufu-" *He watched the rock pillar explode as more rock pillars continued to erupt towards him.*

*Zazark spun around, causing a snake-like swirl of sparks to spiral around him.*

Zazark: "Harh!" *He smashed all the growing pillars to one side with one stroke of his whip.*

Twortz: *She stared at Zazark's shiny whip.* (His whip is silver? Is it metallic or just some sort of paint-?)

Zazark: "I'm tired of that violin-"

Alan: "Pockets of fire, burn, BLAZING HAVOC" *He yelled at the sky and a beam of red magma crashed down on top of Zazark.*

Zazark: "Ahhh!"

Twortz: *She slowly stopped playing and watched the synthetic grass melt like plastic around the red magma.* "I don't-"

Alan: "Heh heh." *He smirked and stood in a powerful pose, causing a brown glyph to zigzag underneath him.*

Twortz: "You killed him? We completed the-?"

Alan: "No-"

Zazark: "Harh!" *He flicked the whip upwards, exploding the lava stream.*

Twortz: "Eeekckee!-" *She watched it rain down with red magma, causing her to kick the ground.* "Sphere of Might."

*A sphere-like pulse blasted the raining magma away from Twortz.*

Alan: "Sturdy might show your patience, defend yourself against all harsh conditions-"

*Alan jumped up and kicked the ground, causing three pillars of rock to erupt around Zazark.*

Alan: "GRANITE PRISON" *He punched his hands together, violently slamming the pillars together, causing swirls of dirt to ring around Zazark.*

Twortz: *She smiled in amazement.* "You did it.."

Alan: *He stared at the tight rock pillars with an emotionless face.* (I can still sense a Neuron signature, though.)

Zazark: *He frowned in complete darkness and twitched his wrist, causing the whip to jab into the ground on its own accord.* "Tangrowth Slash."

*Vein-like whips erupted into the air around Zazark, smashing the pillars away.*

Twortz: "Hickee!" *She gasped in shock and quickly took a deep breath, screaming out a shock wave.* "Sonic Roar."

Zazark: "ROCK PILLAR" *He smirked and kicked the ground, watching a rock pillar suddenly explode past him as it blocked the shock wave.*

Alan: "Bristling spears, hardened might, rain forth at my will, ROCK SPEAR" *He spun around and punched the air, blasting a spiralling rock spear from the ground high into the air.*

Twortz: *She glanced in the area the rock spear shot out from.* (Was that Earth? I couldn't see-, it moved so fast-)

Alan: *He discreetly looked up and smiled.* "Yharh!" *He waved his arm downwards, blasting the spiralling piece of rock into Zazark's shoulder.*

Zazark: "How-?!" *He intensely stared at the rock spear, noticing its unique spiral shape.*

Alan: "That Rostical makes a perfect shape for speed and penetration, no matter the defence, that attack will break through it."

Zazark: "Rock Spear.. Thanks for the Rostical, fufufuf." *He ripped the rock spear out with a smile.*

Alan: (What did that mean?)

Twortz: (These two are completely out of my league!) *She cautiously stood out of attacking range and placed the violin in between her legs, forming a triangle with her fingers.* "Sonic Pulsar."

*Twortz breathed into the spaces in between her fingers, blasting a vortex of sound at Zazark.*

Zazark: "STEELIGHT RETENTION" *He reached across his shoulder and pulled forward, causing a pulse of sparks to scatter around a metallic pole.*

Alan: (Yeah, focus your attention on the Score User-) "Blinding dust, rain down-"

*Alan kicked the ground and a boulder blasted up directly in front of him, causing him to smirk.*

Alan: "ROCK SLIDE" *He punched the boulder and small pebbles shot into Zazark.*

Zazark: *He hissed in pain, watching small bullet-like holes burn into his pants.* (Damn rocks!-)

Twortz: *She smiled with anticipation.* (Almost-)

Zazark: "Grrr!" *He swayed the metallic pole and hit Twortz's vortex of sound away, causing the pole to make a violent humming sound.* "Argh-" *He let go of the pole, watching it suddenly spiral off the podium.*

Twortz: (I thought I had him then.)

Alan: *He listened to the very faint sounds of the metallic pole landing on something under the podium.* (The Rasticsplash alone was able to knock his weapon away-)

Zazark: "I'm fighting you at top power-" *He licked his lips in anger and swayed his hand, causing a metallic pole to suddenly spiral towards Twortz, violently hitting her head on the forehead.*

Twortz: "Ckee!-" *She screamed at deafening levels and dropped onto her back, as she lost control to all her limbs.*

Alan: (He threw another steel pole? I see.. It's Rostical.. The Rock Pillar, steel.. Is he a ground user too-?)

Zazark: "Hah!" *He quickly faced Alan and swayed his arm, violently flicking the whip towards him.*

Alan: *He jumped up and kicked the ground, causing three pillars of rock to erupt around Zazark.* "GRANITE PRISON"

Zazark: "Not again!-" *He flicked his wrist, causing the whip to change angle, violently smashing the pillars away from him.*

Alan: *He watched three dirt clouds fall onto the ground.* (I didn't use the incantation, but to break my pillars with a whip alone-)

Zazark: "Metallic forces be heard, weld my might into one single creation!" *He watched the whip curl back into its unsheathed state, allowing him to place it on his thigh.*

Alan: (His voice slightly echoed, that means!-)

Zazark: *He placed both arms over his shoulders and pulled forward.* "STEELIGHT RETENTION"

Alan: *He watched Zazark hold two metallic poles readying himself to attack.* "I see.."

Zazark: "Afraid?" *He smirked and moved the steels poles, as if they were swords.*

Alan: "Hardly-. PIERCING LAND"

*Alan kicked the ground and caught two lance-shaped boulders, causing Zazark to chuckle.*

Karol: *He noticed the constant commotion in The Hall of Oats suddenly go quiet.* (Evewyone is watching the sckreen.)

Trevour: *He stared at the screen, watching it change camera views of Alan and Zazark.* (Alan.. My brother.. You're still so far ahead from me-)

Lezard: "I thought you and Razzypoo were amazing." *He tilted his head towards Trevour while keeping focus on the screen.* "But watching this fellow, he puts you two to shame."

Trevour: "I can't disagree with you, sir."

Zazark: "Now!-" *He flashstepped directly in front of Alan and swayed the metallic pole downwards.*

Alan: *He quickly flicked a rock lance to the side, deflecting the metallic pole.* "You're strong-"

Zazark: "I don't seek compliments! Bristling spears, hardened might, rain forth at my will, ROCK SPEAR"

Alan: "Rock Spear-?!"

Zazark: "Fufufufufufufu!" *He spun around and punched the air, blasting a spiralling rock spear through Alan's shoulder and into the air.*

Alan: "Imposs-" *He coughed with widening eyes and looked shocked.*

Zazark: "Fufufu!" *He waved his arm downwards, blasting the spiralling piece of rock into Alan's neck.*

Alan: "Ergh-"

Trevour: "Alan!" *He shouted in concern, taking a step forward.*

Lezard: "Alan? You know him?"

Zazark: "Hurts, doesn't it?"

Alan: *He gritted his teeth.* "Our family never goes down without a fight!"

Zazark: "Looks like you'll be the first then-"

Alan: *He firmly held onto the rock lances and pointed one at Zazark, while crossing the other, forming a bow and arrow.* "Melt the stone, inner ground come to my command, eye of life burn with your fury, LAVALANCHE, INCINERATING STREAM"

Zazark: "Are you an archer now-?"

Alan: *He watched the rock lances suddenly burn into flames and warp into lava.* "Harph!"

*Alan swayed his arms forward and strings of lava swirled towards Zazark at incredible speeds.*

Zazark: "Impressive. But all brigade members have a faster flashstep-" *His image suddenly disappeared, causing a sphere-like burst of lava strings to swirl where he stood.*

Alan: "Missed-...?" *He quickly ripped off his number, causing him to fade upwards leaving a ripple in the air.*

Zazark: *He suddenly appeared where Alan was standing and smirked.* "I don't feel his Neurons-" *He quickly looked up, shaking his head in disappointment.* "No Roharnia.. Guess he didn't die-"

Trevour: (Thank the Astragons.. Alan..) *He thought to himself in relief.*

Zazark: *He licked his lips and slowly looked over his shoulder, smirking at Twortz.* "And the Score User-"

?????: "Twortz?!"

Zazark: "Hmm?" *He slowly turned around and watched Rachael, Nathan and Luna step onto the podium.* "Ah-"

Nathan: "Who are-?"

Rachael: *She looked down, gasping to herself.* "Twortz!" *She ran towards Twortz who lay motionless on the floor.*

Zazark: "I am a member of The Black Brigade-"

Luna: "Pssht, we kicked your boss's ass, aye."

Zazark: "Oh?"

Luna: *She grabbed the last arrow and aimed it at Zazark before pulling back on the string.* "You're gone, porcupine-"

Zazark: "Tangrowth Slash." *He touched his whip and watched it jab into the ground, causing vein-like whips to erupt into Luna's chest.*

Luna: "Gah!-" *She wheezed and the arrow suddenly exploded from her bow, encasing her hand in a boulder of ice.*

Nathan: "Luna!-" *He shouted in terror and instinctively grabbed her number and ripped it.*

Luna: "N-Nath?" *She spoke out of character and dropped the bow.*

Destiny: "Yeu-p..." *She meowed, as if she was in pain too.*

Nathan: *He watched Luna and Destiny fade upwards, leaving behind a ripple in the air.* "You, dirty lamp!" *He suddenly filled with rage and held onto his sword with both hands.*

Zazark: "Did I hurt your girlfriend? Fufufu!"

Nathan: (I don't know why I'm so angry.) *He suddenly charged towards Zazark, raising the sword.*

Zazark: "An amateur-"

Nathan: *He suddenly let go of the sword and spun around, dropping under Zazark's steel pole.* "Air Slash-" *He reached upwards and grabbed the sword, slicing a visible air slash downwards.*

Zazark: "Ferg-ck-ar!" *He gargled blood.*

Nathan: *He stood on his knees, firmly holding onto the sword.* "How's that for an amateur? Double Sl-"

Zazark: "Gra!-" *He waved the steel pole to the side, snapping Nathan's sword in half.*

Nathan: *He looked at the handle in surprise, listening to the sword tumble across the podium.* (What kind of technique was-?) *He looked at Zazark, noticing his surprised face too.* (No, it was the sword-)

Zazark: "You get what you paid for, fufufu-" *He quickly bent down and wrapped his arm around Nathan's neck.* "I'm going to snap your neck-"

Nathan: "Tss-" *He shoved the half broken sword into Zazark's arm and purposely twisted it.*

Zazark: "Argh-" *He let go of Nathan and spun around, kicking him in the face.*

Nathan: "O-Ohff-" *He tumbled back and curled up into a ball, placing both hands on his stomach.*

Zazark: *He stood up straight and cracked his neck to each side, firmly holding the steel pole in each hand.* "Tara had trouble with you lot?"

Rachael: *She stood up and formed fists, readying herself to fight.* "Rack off!"

Zazark: "Rack off? Fufufu." *He took several steps towards Rachael.* "Don't you know.. You're going to die."

----------

*Luna suddenly appeared in The Hall of Oats, catching Trevour's attention.*

Trevour: "Sir!" *He nudged Lezard and pointed in shock, watching people in white robes form around Luna.*

Lezard: "Jinkies! Loonzamotto!" *He hobbled towards Luna, causing one of the people in robes to step in front of him.*

Man A: "You can't go past, she's in critical condition."

Lezard: "I'm a healer-"

Man A: "You are not allowed to pass here-"

Trevour: "Little meister." *He nudged his head at the man, causing Karol to nod his head.*

Karol: "Fhun! Yay!" *He squealed and ran around the man, catching his attention.*

Man A: "Kid! Don't run in here!"

Karol: "Nee hee."

Man A: "Stop! Get back here!" *He started to chase after Karol.*

Lezard: *He hobbled up to Luna and placed his hands over her.* "Okies-"

Man B: *He leant back, startled by Lezard's straightforwardness.* "Don't touch her! Leave her to the professionals!"

Man C: *He tried to push Lezard away.* "We're trained for this-"

Lezard: *He ignored the men and started to concentrate on Luna.* "Quick healing shot, HEALING IMPLOSION. Quick internal light, INVOKING AURA"

*The people in white robes gasped at Lezard, as they watched white light slowly close up Luna's wounds.*

Luna: "Gah?" *She slowly opened her eyes, staring at a sketch version of Lezard.* "Where-..?"

Lezard: "Welcome back..."

Luna: "You're healin'..? Aha, thanks, dork."

Lezard: *He smiled in acknowledgement, as if he understood Luna's appreciation.* "Shush, little one."

Luna: *She smirked and closed her eyes, placing her hand on Destiny, ensuring she was okay.* "Wateva."

Grey: *He intensely stared at Zazark through the screen.* "Ordin, go immediately!" *He shouted with urgency.*

Ordin: "Understood, your majesty!" *He punched his armour and marched towards the spinning globe.*

Lezard: "There we are, the bleeding has stopped."

Trevour: *He focused his attention on to Ordin.* "Lezard, sir. Perhaps you should go with him and heal the party?"

Lezard: "Ooo, sounds like a delicious idea, but-"

Luna: "Go, dipshit."

Lezard: "Are you sure? I could heal you a little more-"

Destiny: "Yeup!"

Luna: "Aha, you heard her, aye. Go."

Lezard: *He smiled and nodded his head.* "Karol, keep miss Loonz company. Trevour, keep me company, I'll get lonely."

Karol: "Ohkay!"

Trevour: "Heh heh, sure thing, sir!"

Grey: *He looked down, staring at Ordin.* "Report, please respond."

Ordin: *He touched the globe, causing box-like glyphs to materialise around it, showing miniature versions of the screens.* "I will manually activate a doorway to the Reality Marble once it's charged enough Neurons."

Grey: *He nodded his head, focusing back to the massive screen.* (How did this man get into the Reality Marble without a number? Was he the one that killed my receptionists and imperial guards?)

Trevour: *He stood next to Lezard, as if he was waiting for Ordin to activate the Reality Marble.* "What's the plan, sir?"

Lezard: "Sir? Tee hee, make me all giggly with your formality." *He giggled like a girl.*

Trevour: "Heh heh-" *He awkwardly chuckled.* "But seriously?"

Lezard: "Okay. It's simple. Once he fades into the Spacial Funnel-"

Trevour: "Reality Marble-"

Lezard: "Thankies. Once he goes in there, we'll follow him before it closes up."

Trevour: "Alright." *He nodded his head and slightly bent his knees, as if he was ready to run.*

----------

Twortz: *She started to awaken, instantly touching her forehead with a frown.* "Ouch?"

Rachael: "Twortz." *She looked worried, focusing her attention back to Twortz.*

Twortz: *She gasped.* "Watch out!-" *She quickly hopped up, accidentally knocking Rachael back.*

Rachael: "Twortz-?" *She looked up surprised, as if she wasn't expecting Twortz to suddenly stand up.*

Twortz: "Ckee!-" *She waddled forward with a frown, waving her violin across.*

Zazark: *He smirked at Rachael, running into striking distance.* "STEELIGHT-"

Twortz: "Sonic Rush." *She blew a scattered shock wave in Zazark's face, blasting him off his feet.*

Rachael: *She turned around, staring at Zazark with widening eyes.* (He was fast! He was already in striking distance.)

Zazark: *He landed on his side and slid back on his elbow, frowning at Twortz.* (Dirty Lamp.)

Twortz: *She spiralled the violin and rested it against her shoulder.* "That was close-"

Zazark: *He touched the whip, causing it to uncoil on its own accord.* "Serpent's Touch." *He watched the whip slither towards Twortz and stopped, gently touching her on the chest.*

Twortz: *She looked down, staring at the metallic appearing whip in confusion.* "What is-?"

Zazark: "Fufufu." *He flicked his wrist, causing the whip to pulse, cracking Twortz's ribs.*

Twortz: "Harhckee?" *She gagged with an open mouth and dropped the violin, causing it to disintegrate into tiny white orbs at her feet.*

Rachael: "Twortz?!"

Twortz: "Can't-, breathe-.."

Rachael: *She stepped closer to Twortz and suddenly frowned at Zazark.* "What is with you?! Why don't you just leave us?!"

Zazark: "Fu!-" *He swayed his hand towards Rachael, causing the whip to suddenly wrap around her neck.*

Rachael: "A-Agh-Ack-" *She wheezed and grabbed the whip with both hands.*

Zazark: "What's stopping me from breaking your neck now?" *He stood up and raised his arm, lifting Rachael off her feet.*

Rachael: *She started to hit the whip.* (I can't breathe!-)

Zazark: "Your friends can't help you! I already killed one, who's next?!"

Rachael: *She kicked her feet, trying to slip out of the whip.* (What's holding this whip around my neck? It honestly feels like a Hapkido master wrapping an arm around me-)

Zazark: "The last thing you'll see, are your wounded friends begging for their lives before I kill them-" *He tilted his wrist, forcefully moving Rachael's head at Twortz.*

Rachael: (Twortz-) *The whip tightened around her neck and flicked her head, forcing her to look at Nathan.* (Nathan.)

Zazark: "Fufufu!"

Rachael: (Before I kill them-) *Zazark's words echoed in her mind.*

Zazark: "It won't be long, I can feel your Neurons running out-"

Rachael: *She stopped twitching and dropped her arms, causing all her limbs to dangle.* (I can't.. Give up?)

*Rachael suddenly fell in white light, effectively rendering her blind.*

Rachael: (Where-? I can't! I won't give up! Ashton.. Luna, Twortz, everyone!)

?????: "Where are thou going?" *A woman's voice echoed, as if she was in a hall.*

Rachael: *She stared at the white filled nothingness around her.* "...-"

?????: "Welcome to Valhalla-"

Rachael: "I won't give up!"

?????: "It's fine." *Her voice sounded as if she was smiling.* "All warriors selected to be part-"

Rachael: "It's not fine!"

?????: ".. Thou can't reverse what is happening."

Rachael: "I won't leave my friends behind!" *She started to warp out of the white nothingness.*

?????: "How are thou using that forbidden power?! You can't use that!-"

Rachael: *She suddenly opened her eyes and glared at Zazark.* "Krh!" *She wheezed and a sheet of rock shot up underneath her, stopping her legs from dangling.*

Zazark: "Hmm?"

Rachael: *She raised her arms, causing two arms made of stone to erupt out of the ground.* "..."

Zazark: *He stared at the stone arms in shock.* "What kind of Rostical is that-?"

Rachael: *She punched forward, causing the arm to suddenly smash into Zazark, loudly cracking several bones.* "..."

Zazark: *He slid back on his feet, dropping his whip in astonishment.* "How-?"

Rachael: "Grahr-" *She violently kicked the ground, causing a massive rock pillar to arch out of the ground, smashing up Zazark's face.*

Zazark: *He leant back, spitting out blood and stone.* "Strong-?!"

Rachael: *She sprinted towards the arched rock pillar and a small line of stone shot underneath her, allowing her to jump high into the air.* "..."

Zazark: *He touched his nose, noticing blood pour on to his hand.* "That power-"

Rachael: *She landed heavily on the ground in front of Zazark and swayed to the side, causing a bus-sized brick to sweep Zazark off his feet.* "...-"

Zazark: *He tumbled across the podium and suddenly gripped onto the edge, as he almost fell off.* "Ah?" *He looked down, staring at an enormous drop into darkness.*

Rachael: *She elegantly raised her arm, causing swirls of sand to stream into the air.* "Hmrf-" *She clicked her fingers, causing car-sized boulders to explode from the clustering sand streams.*

Nathan: *He opened his eyes, noticing the floating boulders.* (Where-?)

Rachael: *She pushed her arms back and slid across the ground towards Zazark with an emotionless face.* "..."

Zazark: (I'm the most physically defensive out of the brigade, but this dirty lamp has somehow-) *He pushed himself back onto the podium and looked up, noticing spears of boulders shoot down, jabbing into his hand.* "Argh-"

Rachael: *She continued to slide towards Zazark, ignoring the spears which continued to jab up his arm.* "..."

Zazark: *He looked at Rachael, noticing she slid on a wave of rock.* (How-?)

Rachael: *She nudged her elbow out, causing a massive rock to suddenly erupt on Zazark's side, flinging him to the other side of the podium.*

Zazark: "Argh!" *He shouted in agony, as he watched four large gaping wounds appear on his arm.* (That pillar ripped the rock spears out-)

*Zazark looked up and noticed Rachael above him, staring down at him on a floating boulder.*

Zazark: "Is this some sort of Grand Rostical or Ougi-?!"

Rachael: *She clapped her hands, causing the boulders to suddenly explode into sharp star-like crystals.* "..."

Zazark: "The rocks? They're crystalline now-?"

Rachael: *She punched towards the ground, causing a thick rock pillar to erupt directly underneath Zazark, blasting him high into the air.*

Zazark: "Ka-rgh-" *He coughed out blood and started descend.*

Rachael: *She looked up with an open hand and suddenly squeezed it.* "..."

*A massive rock arm shot out of the ground and suddenly opened its hand, catching Zazark in mid-air.*

Zazark: "Argh!" *He punched the rock arm's fingers, trying to release himself from them.*

Rachael: *She clicked her fingers, causing the nearby star-shaped crystals to explode, shooting shards of crystal at incredible speeds.* "...-"

Zazark: "STEELIGHT RETENTION-" *He blocked several crystals with his steel pole, watching them spiral past him.*

Rachael: *She swayed her arm backwards, causing the crystal spikes to unnaturally spiral back, jabbing into Zazark's shoulder blade.*

Zazark: "Ar!" *He dropped the steel pole, grunting in pain.*

Rachael: *She rocked forward and spiralled on the floating boulder so its base faced Zazark.* "..." *She pushed with both feet on the boulder, violently smashing it into Zazark's face.*

Zazark: *He fell out of an expanding dirt cloud and landed heavily on the ground.* "I-"

Rachael: *She fell towards the ground, queuing an enormous boulder to shoot up, catching her in mid-air.* "..."

Zazark: *He looked up and watched Rachael float on the boulder.* (Where did she obtain this power? She's captain levelled-)

?????: "That's as far as you go!"

Nathan: *He watched Ordin point a large sword at the back of Zazark's head.* (Ordin?)

Zazark: "Fufufu, you can't stop me-"

Ordin: "Quick Sword." *He twitched his wrist, causing Zazark's left arm to slice off and roll in front of him.*

Nathan: (I didn't even see his sword move!-)

Ordin: *He looked up, staring at Rachael in a curious-like manner.* "It is over now. I now have this under control."

Rachael: *The boulder she stood on fell to the ground, allowing her to casually step off of it.* "..."

*Lezard and Trevour staggered behind Ordin, instantly noticing the floating boulders.*

Ordin: "It's a felony to enter restricted Reality Marbles or Spacial Funnels." *He spoke to Trevour and Lezard without moving his head.*

Trevour: (He knew we were here-?)

Lezard: "Ooo, yes sir!" *He giggled and hobbled over to Nathan, spreading his arms out.*

Nathan: *He looked up to Lezard, shaking his head.* "Heal Twortz first." *He spoke on his breath, as if it was a struggle to talk.*

Lezard: "Okies." *He nodded his head and turned around, hobbling towards Twortz.* "HEALING IMPLOSION"

Ordin: *He glanced at the light Lezard produced.* (Radiatons-?)

Zazark: "Fufufu!" *He quickly grabbed his arm off the ground and suddenly disappeared in a flash of purple light before Ordin had a chance to react.*

Trevour: "He got away."

Ordin: *He sheathed his sword and turned around, causing his armour to rattle.* "Due to unseen circumstances, The Agoura Marbles has finished."

*Ordin shouted out with a stern voice, as if he knew the people watching could hear him.*

Grey: "That concludes this year's game!"

Man: *He nudged a small woman next to him, pointing at Rachael.* "Did you see her go?"

Woman: "What a powerful Rostical User."

Man: "Did she win?"

Woman: "I don't know."

Ordin: *He frowned, glancing at each party member.* "What are your names?"

Trevour: "Sir." *He lowered his head for respect.* "My name is-"

*Rachael fell to her knees and lost consciousness, causing the car-sized boulders to suddenly fall on to the ground, shattering along the party's feet.*

Trevour: *He gasped and looked at Rachael, ignoring the rumbling podium under his feet.* (Rachael?)

Lezard: *A boulder smashed close to his side, causing him to jump in fright.* (They were heavy!)

Trevour: "Rachael?" *He started to hobble closer to Rachael, avoiding the falling boulders.*

Rachael: "..." *The sounds around her became muffled.*

Trevour: "Rachael?!" *His voice faded with an echo from Rachael's perspective.*

Rachael: "..." *She listened to her breathing, as everything turned to black.* (Why can't I move? Why can't I speak? Why is everything black? Why.. Am I so.. Sleepy..?)

Chapter 10: The Song's Decision

*Rachael opened her eyes and found herself in the middle of a small flowery meadow, surrounded by a blurred environment.*

Rachael: "Where am I?"

?????: "The third time thy've come to visit thou."

Rachael: "Who-?" *She spun around and stared at a woman dressed in white garbs with blonde hair.*

?????: "It does not matter."

Rachael: "Where am I?"

?????: "Thy see it.. Thou will one day be here again."

Rachael: "Be here?"

?????: *She nodded her head and observed Rachael with widening eyes.* "Are thou complete? Or perhaps beyond the limitations?"

Rachael: "Who are you?!" *She spoke in an annoyed-like manner.* "I'm not keen for games!"

?????: "Thy see." *She spoke in understanding, as if she knew of Rachael's sudden frustration.* "Thy'm known as Arcadia."

Rachael: "Arcadia?"

Arcadia: *She took several steps closer to Rachael, staring at her with different coloured eyes.* "It seems this isn't your time."

Rachael: "What are you-?" *She noticed Arcadia's eyes, causing her to stop in mid-sentence.* "One of your eyes is red, and the other is hazel?"

Arcadia: "That is due to my abilities."

Rachael: *She touched her head.* (I'm so confused.)

Arcadia: "Thy can feel thou confusion."

Rachael: "How can you feel that?"

Arcadia: "Thy am more curious as to how you warped out of the Astral process?"

Rachael: "I have no inkling idea what you're talking about."

Arcadia: "Ooo, jinkies, Razzypoo, open your eyes!"

Rachael: "Jinkies? Razzypoo?"

*Rachael suddenly gasped into consciousness, finding herself on a single bed inside a small room.*

Lezard: *He stood over Rachael's bedside with his arms spread across her.* "Y-You're awake!" *He spoke in shock, as if he wasn't expecting Rachael to be conscious.*

Rachael: "Lezard? Arcadia?"

Lezard: "Nope, it's me, Lezardy, bwarharh." *He smiled in relief and lowered his arms, causing a constant light to fade away from Rachael.*

Rachael: *She looked down and touched her warm clothes caused by Lezard's light.* "Thank you, Lezard-"

Lezard: *He accidentally staggered forward and placed his hand on the side of Rachael's bed.* "Beg your pardon, little monster-" *He paused to take a deep breath.*

Rachael: (He's so out of breath-) "What happened?"

Lezard: "Grey and Ordin essentially cancelled the games."

Rachael: "Weren't the games really big? I'm mean, really big?"

Lezard: "Yes." *He spoke with a smile and leant back.*

Rachael: "What's with the smirk then, Lezard?"

Lezard: "Ooo, it's a plot twist." *He giggled and started to spin out of the room like a ballerina.*

Rachael: *She observed the room and leant up, dangling her legs on the side of the bed.* "We're in the castle."

Lezard: *He stopped just outside the room and glanced to each side, observing the hallways on the level.* "Bingo."

Rachael: "At the Inn-like rooms."

Lezard: "Correctamotto."

Rachael: "Where is everyone."

Lezard: "Correct-, oh.. I mean." *He coughed to clear his throat and faced Rachael, leaning on the door frame to the room.* "They're scattered in the castle."

Rachael: "Am I right to get up?"

Lezard: "I sure hope so, little monster. I've never put so much effort in keeping a consistent Remenistal active to heal someone before."

Rachael: *She smiled and jumped onto her feet, taking the time to get used to it.* "I really appreciate that-"

Lezard: "Naw, shucks. It's fine." *He giggled, watching Rachael walk towards him.*

Rachael: "About what happened after-"

Lezard: "Well-" *He raised his arm and bent his elbow, implying for Rachael to wrap hers around it.*

Rachael: "Well?" *She wrapped her arm around Lezard's allowing him to escort her out of the room.*

Lezard: "I healed Twortz and Nathan to the point of walking."

Rachael: "This was back in the games, right?"

Lezard: "Yuppers. After healing them, I inspected you, and you were stiff like a log, bwarharh! Trevour and Ordin had to carry you out of the Spacial Funnel."

Rachael: "Oh." *She started to walk up the steps, trying to gather a mental image from Lezard's tale.*

Lezard: "We got you here and I offered to look after you."

Rachael: "What about the games?"

Lezard: "Despite the games being cancelled, the people were still satisfied."

Rachael: "They were satisfied? How?"

Lezard: "The spectators can track each contestant through screens, so, we saw what happened."

Rachael: "Isn't that an invasion of privacy-?"

?????: "Yes."

Lezard: *He stepped onto the next floor, noticing Ordin walking towards him.* "He's here, everyone act casual." *He looked away from Ordin and lifted one leg behind him.*

Rachael: "Hehe, you're so weird, Lezard."

Ordin: "Young teenagers are part of our audience and watch the games-" *He stopped in front of Rachael and Lezard.* "Some contestants in the past were seen doing adult related stuff. That is why we implemented one of the core rules, to always move forward."

Rachael: "Oh?"

Ordin: "Regardless. I'm very impressed with you-....?"

Rachael: "Rachael."

Lezard: *He giggled, nodding his head.* "You gave everyone a massive performance."

Ordin: "Yes. I was coming down to check on your progress."

Lezard: "She's all dandy now, mister."

Rachael: "Yep." *She smiled and formed a fist, as if she was feeling refreshed.*

Ordin: "Despite not officially being a winner, Grey has decided to offer you a feast for such a splendid performance, and to show his appreciation for your friend's efforts."

Rachael: "Wow, thank you!"

Lezard: "Wowza indeedly-doo."

Ordin: "A few of your companions are in the research facility. The remainder is in his majesty's presence."

Rachael: "That's awesome."

Ordin: "The feast commences in one hour." *He turned around and started to walk away, causing his armour to rattle.*

Rachael: "So, off to the research facility?"

Lezard: "Oh.." *He spoke with no morale.*

Rachael: "What's wrong?"

Lezard: "The groundshaker is there." *He rolled his eyes.*

Rachael: "Who?"

Lezard: "You know, hahahackee!" *He purposely laughed like Twortz.*

Rachael: *She sighed with a smile.* "Let's go, Lezard."

----------

*Twortz and Luna sat together on a large computer-like station, watching a massive screen run through a database.*

Luna: "This is bullshit, aye.."

Twortz: "..."

Destiny: "Yeu..." *She meowed with sadness, as if she was portraying what Luna felt.*

Twortz: (Nothing...-)

Rosterology Console: "No results found."

Twortz: *She leant forward, frowning in desperation.* "Okay..-"

Luna: "Oi!-" *She snapped her fingers.* "Try a food fast place, aye."

Twortz: "I'd prefer if you didn't snap in my face, but good idea." *She started to type on a keyboard-like console.* "Fast Food Enterprise."

Luna: *She watched Twortz place her hand on a crescent sphere which acted as the 'enter' button.* "C'mon-"

Twortz: *She watched the screen scan through its database.* (We've tried Earth, Dee Highs, cities, towns, cosmetic brands, cars, types of animals.. Nothing-)

Rosterology Console: "No results found-"

Luna: "W-Wat does this mean..?"

Twortz: "There's nothing about our home in the world's database."

Luna: "Nothin'?"

Twortz: "Nothing."

Luna: "Then..-"

Twortz: "...-"

?????: "How is your research going?"

*A woman with blue eyes and hair dressed in white researcher-like clothes, stared at the screen past Twortz and Luna, pushing professional appearing glasses up with two fingers.*

Twortz: "We've had no luck, Dawn."

Dawn: "Tsskt." *She frowned in an annoyed-like manner and pinched her glasses with two fingers to keep it from moving, as she further inspected the screen.* "Have you tried typing in ways to find your home?"

Twortz: "No." *She spoke in shock, as if ideas flowed into her mind.* "I think I got some more."

Dawn: *She leant back and smiled, focusing her attention to several researchers who typed on similar Rosterology consoles.* "You! I expect the research logs to be completed in fifteen!"

Researcher: "Yes, ma'am!"

Dawn: "For research!" *She fist pumped the air, causing several researchers to do the same.*

Luna: "The fuck?" *She looked at the researchers like they were idiots.*

Twortz: "Settle that foul mouth of yours."

Luna: "Aye?"

Twortz: "I don't want to ruin the chance we got to find a way home."

Luna: "Pssht... True." *She grunted and folded her arms, as if she didn't care.*

Twortz: "Worlds.." *She typed in the word and watched the screen run through a database.*

Luna: "Worlds? Is that your magical question?"

Twortz: "Yes. It should mention something or anything about different worlds."

Luna: "We want to find a way home, not go space travellin'."

Twortz: *She shook her head.* "For all we know, there could be some Rosterology platform that transports you far away."

Luna: "Pssht, yea.. There're five special glyphy things in different secrets area that need to be activated in order to transport to a different world." *She spoke in a sarcastic-like manner and rolled her eyes.*

Twortz: "Lighten-"

Rosterology Console: "No results found."

Twortz: "Special transportation." *She spoke while typing and watched the screen run through another database scan.*

Luna: "I thought we would've found somethin', aye.."

Destiny: "Yeup.."

Rosterology Console: "No results-"

Luna: "We get it, dumbshit!"

Twortz: "Yelling at the machine isn't going to achieve anything-"

Luna: "I'm actually a gamer, you don't understand. Yellin' at the fucken-"

Twortz: "Lighten."

Luna: "At the shit nuggets, works."

Twortz: (Shit nuggets?) *She sighed in thought.*

Destiny: "Yeup?" *She looked up, staring at Luna with puppy-like eyes.*

Luna: *She looked down, running her fingers through Destiny's soft purple fur.* "Try aliens."

Twortz: "Aliens?" *She sounded unimpressed.*

Luna: "Just do it."

Twortz: "Aliens-" *She typed on the keyboard and glanced at Luna, as she placed her hand on the crescent button.*

Luna: "Wat?"

Twortz: "Aliens?"

Luna: "Shuddup."

Rosterology Console: "No results found."

Luna: "Umm." *She squinted her eyes in recollection.* "Try the rainbow coloured stuff."

Twortz: "Bubblegum?"

Luna: "Not bubblegum, dipshit, the stuff in the sky."

Twortz: "Aurora?"

Luna: "Yea, that's it!"

Twortz: *She sighed.* "Aurora.."

Luna: "Then try the comet."

Twortz: "You think the comet had something to do with it?"

Luna: "C'mon, it's hell obvious."

Twortz: "...-"

Rosterology Console: "No results found."

Twortz: "Sceldrant's Comet."

Luna: (Work.. Just work.. Even if it's a slight clue that we're not crazy-)

Rosterology Console: "No results found-"

Twortz: *She leant back, causing the seat she sat in to automatically slide back in a recliner-like fashion.* "Absolutely nothing.."

Luna: "Wat does this mean?"

Twortz: "..." *She paused, causing Luna to frown.*

Luna: "Oi."

Twortz: "It means.. We're... Stuck here.."

Luna: "W-Wat..?"

*Rachael and Lezard walked into the research facility, noticing Luna and Twortz.*

Rachael: "Luna.. Twortz.."

Luna: "Rachael, Lizard-"

Lezard: "Lezard."

Luna: "'Sup, Rachael and wateva."

Lezard: "Naw." *He lowered his head in shame.*

Luna: (Now I don't have to hang out with that bitch.) *She glanced at Twortz through Destiny's eyes and stood up.* (I won't forgive wat she did at the games, and not that it mattered, but she hasn't even bothered to apologise.)

Twortz: "Rachael, Lezard." *She slowly stood up and placed her hands behind her back, cupping them for a professional appearance.*

Dawn: "Who are these people?" *She walked up to Rachael and Lezard and gasped.* "The powerful ground user!"

Rachael: "Powerful?"

Lezard: *He noticed Rachael's confused face.* "Don't you remember, Razzypoo?"

Rachael: "Last thing I remember is getting choked by that guy."

Twortz: *She shook her head.* "I was knocked out."

Luna: "I wasn't even there, aye."

Dawn: "Do you possess the ability to freely manipulate the ground around you?" *She closely observed Rachael from every angle while adjusting her glasses.*

Rachael: "I think so?" *She sounded unsure.*

Lezard: "Going by our delicious adventures together, I don't recall you being able to levitate numerous huge boulders and moving them with such ease."

Rachael: "I did?"

Dawn: "Interesting." *She brushed her fingers through her blue hair and adjusted her glasses with two fingers.* "This calls for research."

Rachael: "Research?"

Lezard: *He whispered in Rachael's ear.* "Don't worry, that's a Dawn thing."

Rachael: "Okay-"

Lezard: "More importantly, any information regarding your home?"

Rachael: "Oh?" *She sounded interested.*

Lezard: "Yes-sir-ee." *He giggled at Rachael.* "We finally had the honour of going through the database."

Rachael: "And? Where are we?! Can we find a way home?!" *She spoke with growing excitement.*

Luna: "Nah." *She sounded upset and brushed past Rachael and Lezard, making her way down the hallway.*

Rachael: *She listened to Luna's footsteps echo down the hallway.* "What happened?"

Twortz: "Ahem." *She coughed to clear her throat.* "There's nothing."

Rachael: "Nothing? What do you mean nothing?"

Twortz: "Precisely that.. There are no records of Dee Highs, no records of Earth, cars, fast food chains-"

Rachael: "W-What about-?"

Twortz: "The world's most popular brands-"

Rachael: "Oh.." *She unintentionally lowered her shoulders, as if her idea was already used.*

Twortz: "There's absolutely nothing, Rachael."

Lezard: "That means.."

Rachael: "We're stuck here?"

Twortz: "I thought we..." *She looked down with lowering morale.*

Rachael: "Twortz."

Twortz: "I just wanted a shower.. A bath.. Listening to my favourite band.. Going back to work.. Seeing everyone's faces again."

Lezard: (When she isn't stuffing her mouth with food or dribbling poop, she can make you really feel for what she has got to say.) *He silently looked at Rachael and Twortz, feeling sorry for them.*

Dawn: "If there's anything research can help you with, let me know. You have gained Grey and Ordin's respect, so I guess I'm obliged to help you out if I can."

Rachael: "Thank you, Dawn?"

Dawn: "That's me." *She stepped to the side and observed a desk full of paperwork.* "I have to go through the incidents involving the Black Brigade member."

Twortz: "I am very grateful that you've allowed us to use your research area."

Dawn: "No problem. You're all welcome to use it at any time. Just as long as there's a spare Rosterology console." *She smiled and started to walk towards the desk.*

Lezard: "Thankies, my darling lady."

Dawn: "For research!" *She fist pumped the air, causing several researchers to do the same.*

Rachael: "So, what now?" *She looked at Twortz, as if she didn't know what to do.*

Twortz: "Nor do I know. I was under the impression, once we found the information we needed, about finding a way home, we'd pursue that.."

Rachael: "Same.."

Lezard: "Well, how about we meet the others?"

Rachael: "What about Luna?"

Lezard: "She's probably gone up with them."

Twortz: (What am I going to do? Should I stay with these people? Or.. Should I do what I'm best at? Making a name for myself..)

Rachael: "Twortz?" *She faced the door and looked over her shoulder, as if she was waiting for Twortz to come.*

Twortz: "Indeed."

Lezard: "And we walk into the hallway, to notice a long thin carpet on polished floors-"

*Twortz sighed and continued to waddle with Rachael down the hallway, listening to the different sounds of footsteps as Lezard purposely hobbled on the carpet.*

----------

*Grey sat in his fancy royal looking chair on top of an active glowing red glyph, in the middle of a circular table, outside in a peaceful grassy meadow.*

Grey: "So, you're no longer part of the warriors, how fascinating." *He spoke with a mild Asian accent, nodding his head at Trevour.*

Trevour: *He sat on the outer circle of the table, nodding his head at Grey.* "Yes, your majesty."

Grey: "I didn't know it was possible to leave the rankings."

Trevour: "It's not, your majesty."

Grey: "Well, under the king's rule, you are hereby protected under Silver Wind Island's rules!"

Trevour: *He paused with a widening smile.* "Y-You're too kind."

Grey: "Also-" *The glyph spiralled, causing him to slightly shift to the side facing Karol.* "I'm very upset to hear about your city, Karol."

Karol: "..." *He quickly and shyly looked down with blushing cheeks.*

Grey: "Yohoho." *He chuckled in understanding.* "Our city has a powerful alliance with the sacred dancers."

Karol: "..."

Grey: "You're more than welcome to stay if you like."

Karol: "F-Fank yooh." *He mumbled while staring at the table.*

Grey: "And-" *The glyph rotated, allowing him to stare at Nathan.* "Nathan."

Nathan: "Yes, your majesty?"

Grey: "What are your plans now?"

Nathan: "I'm interested in finding the location to the yellow-eyed disease."

Grey: "Yellow-eyed disease-?"

*Ordin and Luna suddenly warped into the grassy meadow, catching Grey's attention.*

Luna: "Whoa." *She looked up, staring at the clouds in the aqua sky.*

Grey: "Please, sit."

Ordin: "Your majesty." *He bowed and proudly walked forward, sitting on one of the vacant seats on the circular table.*

Luna: "..." *She silently sat on the seat and looked at the empty table.*

Grey: "And this must be Luna?"

Luna: "Yea." *She looked up.* "Whoa, you're Asian!"

Grey: "Ayshern? Please respond?"

Luna: *She noticed the sincerity in his confusion, causing her to sigh in a mature-like manner.* "Ah, nothin'..."

Destiny: "Yeup."

Grey: "Blind, but guided by a Scoldrant's vision. Absolutely amazing."

Nathan: *He looked at Luna, unintentionally facing her on his seat, as if he was excited to talk to her.* "Well, did you find a way home?"

Luna: "No.. I'm stuck here."

Destiny: "Yeup..." *She meowed with lowering morale.*

Grey: "There was nothing in Dawn's database about the world you come from?"

Luna: "W-Wat?" *She spoke in shock, unsure if he knew the truth.*

Trevour: "He is very understanding." *He spoke as if he was the one that told him.*

Luna: "How can a ruler believe somethin' so out of it."

Grey: "Yohoho."

Luna: "Yohohoh?" *She leant back slightly surprised by Grey's laugh.*

Grey: "I've seen things, know of things. I wouldn't put it past me about there being other worlds."

*Twortz, Lezard and Rachael suddenly warped into the grassy field, causing Grey to wave them towards the table.*

Rachael: "Where are we?" *She looked slightly ill.*

Lezard: "You think the ruler of The Agoura Marbles wouldn't have Reality Marbles of his own?"

Twortz: *She looked up, shaking her head in wonder.* "It's amazing, really."

Grey: "Ah, is this everyone?"

Trevour: "Yes, your majesty."

Grey: "How is the situation, Ordin?"

Ordin: "Despite the usual amount of life threatening casualties from The Agoura Marbles, fifteen unclassified deaths have been reported."

Grey: "From that Black Brigade member?"

Ordin: "Yes. He infiltrated The Hall of Oats after the sign ups-"

Rachael: "Wait, how can you talk about the deaths so easily?"

Grey: *The glyph rotated, causing him to face Rachael.* "Upon accepting a number, the contestants are told of the consequences involved when participating."

Rachael: "Well, I wasn't told any of this."

Grey: "Yet, you always had the option of removing yourself from the very start."

Rachael: "True."

Ordin: "We currently don't know his location, but we are certain he's no longer in the city."

Grey: "How did he get in the city in the first place?"

Ordin: "We believe it's through a teleportation glyph from one of the small imperial hideouts."

Grey: (I see.)

Ordin: "I will inform you if we learn anything else."

Grey: "Excellent."

Ordin: *He nodded his head.* "Other than that, your majesty, nothing else to report."

Nathan: *He looked at Luna, as if he wanted to say something.* "..."

Grey: "Who's hungry?"

Nathan: "Hungry?" *He looked up with boosted morale.*

Lezard: "Ooo, pick me, pick me!" *He giggled, waving his hand above his head.*

Trevour: *He tilted his head down, listening to his stomach rumble.* "Me too, heh heh."

Grey: *He clapped his hands, causing plates full of food to suddenly warp across the circular table.* "Now-"

Rachael: "Wow!" *She stared at the plates in amazement, noticing they all sat on different coloured glyphs.*

Nathan: "You never know of wealth until you experience it.." *He mumbled to himself in amazement.*

Grey: "Yohoho! One of you theoretically would have completed the games, so the feast is a celebration!"

Twortz: (Of course I would have.)

Karol: *He looked down at the tray of food, causing him to pout like a child.* "I-I dhon't like this-"

Ordin: (Seafood? Not interested-) *He reached over and tapped on a nearby dish, causing it to float off the table and into the circle.*

Trevour: *He watched the dish slide to the other side.* (Impressive. Having the ability to slide the dishes across the table breaks the con in having a circular based table-)

Ordin: "Man in the warrior's armour, pass me the dish on your left."

Trevour: "Of course, sir?" *He spoke in confusion and awkwardly nudged the dish, causing it to slide towards Ordin.*

Twortz: (The dishes slide like an air hockey-)

Lezard: "They're on glyphs, ah, I see!" *He clapped his hands and took several chicken legs off from a nearby sliding plate.* "Ooo, this is a mini-game in itself!"

Destiny: *She eyed a sliding dish of fish, causing Luna to awkwardly smile with a pout.* "Yeu?"

Luna: "Wateva." *She quickly grabbed several of the fish and placed it on an empty plate in front of her.*

Destiny: "Yeup." *She purred in appreciation and hopped off Luna's shoulder, suddenly stuffing her face in.*

Luna: (You must've been pretty hungry... Back on Earth.. I was pretty shit with looking after pets.. Not that you're a pet, aye.)

Twortz: "So, allow me to put it bluntly." *She spoke with a lack of concentration, as she filled her plate up with all sorts of foods.*

Trevour: *He nodded his head with anticipation, as if he was excited about the topic.* "I'm curious to know about your findings after using the research facility."

Twortz: "There were absolutely no results on anything from our world."

Trevour: *He lowered the food in his hands, placing them on his plate with a fading smile.* "Oh no-"

Luna: "Oh no is the half of it.." *She spoke with her head down.*

Nathan: (So they couldn't find anything?) *He silently thought to himself and shoved three thin steaks into his mouth.*

Rachael: "So the question is.."

Twortz: "What's happening now?"

Rachael: "Well-" *She looked at Karol and smiled.* "I want to help Karol find his family."

Karol: *He stopped eating and stared at Rachael with blushing cheeks.* "Waichael?"

Rachael: *She nodded her head.* "That's what I want to do."

Trevour: "I'd like to accompany Rachael and Karol on their adventures."

Rachael: "Trevour?"

Trevour: "Yes. As strange as it sounds, I feel safe with you around."

Lezard: "Ooo, pick me! I'm cool and I stick with the cool people." *He implied he wanted to join Rachael too.*

Rachael: "Hehe, you too, Lezard?"

Lezard: "Yuppers!"

Karol: (Wow..) *He thought to himself in disbelief, as if he wasn't expecting the friendly attitudes.*

Luna: "Pssht, I dunno wat I'm gonna do, aye.."

Rachael: "Why not get to know Destiny a little more?"

Luna: "Rachael?"

Rachael: "Yeah?"

Luna: "Shut up."

Rachael: "..."

Grey: *He looked at Twortz with a smile.* "And what are you going to do?"

Twortz: "I'm not entirely sure."

Rachael: "Stick with us?"

Twortz: "What about a source of income? What about food? A place to stay? What about The Black Brigade chasing after us?"

Rachael: "Don't worry about all that-"

Twortz: "Don't worry about all that? Do you hear yourself?" *She wiped her mouth and pushed away an empty plate.*

Grey: "There's no need to worry about that. I can offer accommodation-, ah! That reminds me, Ordin."

Ordin: "Yes." *He reached to his side and suddenly pulled forward, causing a pulse of sparks to scatter around a shiny green bangle.*

Rachael: "What is that?"

Grey: "That is the Purifying Oxident."

Rachael: "Purifying Oxident?"

Ordin: "It's the prize for winning the games."

Grey: "The same for Battling Oxident."

Twortz: *She slammed her hand on the table and shook her head.* "Am I honestly the only person that sees through adult tinted glasses?"

Lezard: "Eww, that sounds dirty-"

Twortz: "Shut up, you retarded twat!"

Lezard: "Ouchies-"

Rachael: "He's our friend, you shouldn't talk to him like that-"

Twortz: "Get off your high horse. He's your friend for starters, and-" *She formed a fist.* "You aren't the real Rachael."

Rachael: "Uhm?"

Luna: "Can I have wateva you're on?"

Twortz: "Shut up, you emo bitch."

Luna: "Fuck you-"

Destiny: "Yeuuuu." *She hissed and frizzed her fur in anger.*

Nathan: "..."

Lezard: "Well, this escalated quickly."

Trevour: "Twortz, please reconsider where your actions are obviously going-"

Twortz: *She looked at Trevour with a fading frown.* "You are the sanest person out of these people, come with me?"

Trevour: "I-I'm sorry, Twortz. I had already made up my mind a while ago-"

Twortz: "Fine." *She turned around and took a step forward.*

Ordin: "How disrespectful!" *His words caused Twortz to pause.* "Despite winning the games, he is the ruler-"

Twortz: "My apologies." *She stepped away from the table and suddenly warped out.*

Rachael: *She wiped her mouth with a white napkin and stood up.* "Sorry about her, she's probably stressed about not finding a way home."

Trevour: "That's probably it, your majesty. She's usually very clear minded and level headed."

Grey: "..." *He waved his hand off, as if he was giving Rachael permission to leave.*

Rachael: "I'll be back shortly." *She awkwardly bowed as if she didn't know what to do and turned around, jogging out of the Reality Marble.*

Nathan: *He awkwardly looked at Luna.* "You seem to be holding up fine?"

Luna: "I'm fine aye."

Destiny: "Yeup?" *She looked at Luna in confusion, as if she knew that was a lie.*

Luna: (I suffer behind the curtains..) *She sighed in thought and continued to eat.*

Lezard: "Well, what a delicious day we're having?" *He tried to change the subject and looked up to the sky.*

Trevour: "It's probably night time now."

Lezard: "Ooo? Doesn't anyone here like night time?"

Grey: "Yohoho."

----------

*Twortz ran out of the castle, causing the white doors to ripple around her.*

Twortz: *She looked up, noticing it was night.* (So it was night time? I thought it was always day-?)

Rachael: "Twortz!-" *She jogged out of the castle and towards Twortz.*

Twortz: *She sighed in frustration.* "Why did you follow me?!" *She shouted without looking back.*

Rachael: "What's up? Why did you leave?"

Twortz: "I'm done with this place-"

Rachael: "It's understandable you're upset, but you don't have to be a cow about it."

Twortz: "A cow?" *She stopped and glared ahead with growing anger.* "Is it because I'm fat?"

Rachael: "Fat? No. I'm not really a fan of swearing-"

Twortz: "Why don't you speak your mind to this cow?"

Rachael: "Really? Grow up-"

Twortz: *She angrily placed her hand over her shoulder.* "Now this cow needs to grow up?"

Rachael: *She noticed Twortz's hand.* "What, now you're threatening me?"

Twortz: "You're so feeble."

Rachael: "Feeble?" *She sounded confused, as if she didn't know what the word meant.* "I.. Thought we were friends?"

Twortz: "..."

Rachael: *She stared at Twortz's back.* "You said it yourself.. Don't you remember? You said.. I was one of the few people you would risk losing your job over, just by being my friend."

Twortz: *She frowned and held onto something, as if she was ready to release her violin.* "What happened in the past, is the past. People change."

Rachael: "People change? What a load of rubbish!"

Twortz: "A load of rubbish?" *She spoke in a condescending tone.* "Once again, listen to yourself! This isn't a pathetic fantasy game, Rachael Taylor!"

Rachael: *She formed emotional fists.* "You can't leave! You can't leave me here by myself!"

Twortz: "You have new stupid friends to associate yourself with now."

Rachael: "The truth is, we're friends, Twortz. I don't turn my back on my friends-"

Twortz: "Don't throw your moral book in my face.. Nobody likes that."

Rachael: ".. Aren't we friends?"

Twortz: "So naive, Rachael."

Rachael: (If that's the case..) *Her eyes started to water.* (How stupid am I-.. Twortz?)

Twortz: *She stared down the road-like path with an emotionless face.* "Nothing more to say?"

Rachael: (I don't know why.. I don't know why... But-...) "I can't bear the thought of you leaving by yourself-"

Twortz: "You can forget that stupid mind frame you have. This is reality, it's not some cartoon where we all hold hands and act like one big pathetic family."

Rachael: "Twortz-"

Twortz: "Sonic Rush." *She quickly turned around and swayed the violin, blowing a scattered shock wave at Rachael.*

Rachael: *She looked surprised and quickly kicked the ground, causing a rock pillar to erupt up in front of her, blocking the shock wave.* "Twortz?!"

*Rachael shouted in anger and swayed her hand to the side, causing the rock pillar to crumble away.*

Rachael: "What are you-?" *She stopped in mid-sentence and stared at Twortz who stood in the fading dirt cloud directly in front of her with a dagger already on the violin's strings.* (How did she move so-?)

Twortz: *She stared at Rachael with an emotionless face.* "Sacred scores, Lymph's Wave."

Rachael: "What Azure Burst is-?"

*Visible strings of sound echoed off the violin and slammed into Rachael's chest, cracking her ribs.*

Rachael: *She violently threw up what she ate beforehand and collapsed to her knees.* "When-?"

Twortz: *She held the violin in between her legs and formed a triangle with her fingers, blowing into them.* "Sonic Pulsar."

*Twortz screamed out a vortex of sound directly into Rachael's face, causing a yellow mucus to run out of her ears.*

Rachael: "My ears!" *She screamed at the top of her lungs even though it was masked by the fading violin sounds and Twortz's vortex.*

Twortz: "..." *She grabbed onto the violin and casually spun around, walking out of Rachael's sight.*

Rachael: "That's it.. There's no doubt about it.. She's serious about this.. She really means to.. Twortz.."

*Rachael moaned the last words and closed her eyes, slowly falling unconscious.*

Lezard: "Razzypoo? Grumble bum?" *He stepped out of the castle and noticed Rachael, lying on the ground, causing him to gasp.* "Everyone!"

*Lezard spoke in a serious manner and hobbled towards Rachael, as the party slowly made their way out.*

----------

Twortz: *She stormed up to a man who slept on a large ostrich-like Scoldrant with his cowboy hat tilted down on his face.* "Wake up!"

Man: "Shnah-?!" *He snorted into consciousness.* "Whe-ere-?"

Twortz: "Silence! I wish to use your Scoldrant."

Man: "We are closed ri-aight na-ow-"

Twortz: *She leant forward and placed the violin's dagger against his throat.* "You are to get me out of here now."

Man: "Rai-aight-" *He gently nodded his head and touched the ostrich, causing it to wake up.* "Where do you whanna go-oh?"

Twortz: "Sorrowprax." *She spoke in determination, causing the man to gulp nervously and loudly.*

----------

Lezard: "Again! Quick internal light, INVOKING AURA" *Swirls of light sparkled around Rachael.*

Nathan: "Why is it taking so long?"

Trevour: "Indeed, sir. From what I've seen, your patients usually regain consciousness by now."

Karol: "Waichael?"

Luna: (She better not die. She's like, the one keepin' this party together.)

Lezard: (I don't understand-?) "Quick internal light, INVOKING AURA"

Ordin: "That woman, she was a sound user. High-density shockwaves can wound many internal organs at once, that is probably why even a Radiaton User is having trouble."

Lezard: "Quick internal light, INVOKING AURA"

Luna: "Meanin'?"

Trevour: "If we didn't have Lezard, she would've died."

Ordin: "Yes."

Luna: "Twotters?" *She gasped, focusing back to Rachael and the light.* "She's dead." *She threatened Twortz on her breath and frowned.*

Grey: *He looked at Rachael and glanced at the party.* "In what mannerism should I deal with this?"

Trevour: "For now, I'd leave it, your majesty sir-"

Luna: "Leave it?! Let's hunt the slurry down! It won't be hard to miss her!" *She pretended to flick the string of a bow.*

Nathan: (What possessed Twortz to do this? As what Trevour said, she was very mature minded-)

Rachael: "Kerhh-" *She exhaled and twitched, causing Lezard to sigh in relief while keeping his healing pose.*

Karol: "W-Waichael?!"

Lezard: "This is a good sign, little monster-"

Man: "Help?!"

*A man shouted in the distance, causing Nathan, Luna and Ordin to look up.*

?????: "Kerarhhh!" *A reptilian-like hiss followed by several thumps, caused another man to scream in agony.*

Ordin: "It came from upstairs!" *He started to run forward.*

Nathan: "I'm coming!"

Grey: "In my city? I have to see what this ordeal is about."

Luna: "Pssht." *She grunted and chased after Nathan.*

Destiny: "Yeup?" *She guided Luna through her sketch-like vision.*

Lezard: *He glanced at Karol and Trevour.* "I'll be fine, little monsters. You can go if you want."

Trevour: "I'm fine, sir."

Karol: "Me tooh." *He plunked himself on the ground and patiently waited for Rachael to wake up.*

Lezard: "Bwarharh, I can't say no to company."

Trevour: "Heh heh."

----------

*Ordin, Nathan and Luna ran across the wooden bridge to find Grey already waiting for them on a floating glyph.*

Man: "Help!"

Grey: "This way." *He looked to his side, queuing the glyph to float towards the sounds.*

Ordin: *He took an awkward step and jumped high into the air, observing the third level of the city from a bird's eye view.* "W-What?"

Nathan: *He noticed Ordin's strange reaction.* "What is-?" *He ran around a corner and slowed down, gasping with widening eyes.* "Huh?"

Luna: *She bumped into Nathan and frowned at him, before noticing the scene in front of her.* "W-Wat the hell?"

Destiny: "Y-Yeup!" *She started to tremble in fear, causing Luna to run her fingers through her fur for comfort.*

----------

*Twortz rode on the ostrich through a field, holding onto the man's waist in front of her.*

Twortz: "How long will it take to get there?"

Man: *He looked up, staring at the moon.* "With m-eye Scol-draynt, we should get th-air before sunr-ise."

Twortz: "It is too hard to understand you, do you speak normal?"

Man: "Naww." *He shook his head.* "This Scol-draynt can run on water, roh-arcs, tr-ees and some-tymes, air."

Twortz: "So we should get there rather quickly?"

Man: *He adjusted his hat and kicked the ostrich on the side, causing its speed to drastically increase.* "Yee-harh!"

Twortz: *She leant back, as her hair rapidly flapped behind her.* (Excellent.)

*The ostrich-like Scoldrant jumped up and started to run on the treetops as if they were bushes on the ground.*

Twortz: *She smirked with squinted eyes, as if she was happy with herself.* "I will look after myself, take care of myself.. I will become a warrior!"

Chapter 11: Scoldrants Attack!

*A man gasped in terror and crawled on his back away from a reptilian appearing hippo-like Scoldrant.*

Ordin: "What's happening here?!"

Man: "My Scoldrants! There's something wrong with them!"

Grey: *He noticed five reptilian, hippo-like Scoldrants readying to destroy nearby buildings.* "You're a Scoldrant User? If not, why do you have Scoldrants? Please respond!"

Man: "I-I am a Scoldrant User, my babies are used for their nutritious milk, but-"

Hippo: "Kerarhhh!" *It opened its massive jaw and its teeth shined a fluoro blue.* "Ice Fang."

Nathan: *He gasped.* "We won't make it in-"

Hippo: *Two fluoro blue streams suddenly pierced towards the man and exploded into ice.* "Kerarhhh?"

Ordin: *He suddenly appeared in front of the man, blocking the ice streams with his sword.* "Hmph."

Nathan: "Huh?" *He looked to his side, noticing Ordin was not there.*

Luna: "Aye? He was standin' right next to us-"

Ordin: "Hard Blade." *An aura swirled around his sword and instantly sliced through the hippo, causing all its legs to fall off its body.*

Man: "My babies!"

Ordin: *He noticed all the Scoldrant's eyes suddenly glow an eerie yellow colour, catching his attention.* "What?"

Grey: "What is happening?"

Ordin: "The physical change in their eyes, is this Neuron related? Are they powering up?!" *He raised the sword.*

Man: "These Scoldrants have their power in their teeth, not their eyes!"

Nathan: "It's happening.."

?????: "It's the-" *A man stepped forward, wearing a red silk sun-like robe.*

?????: "Condition." *A woman finished off his sentence, wearing a blue silk moon-like robe.*

Luna: "Who are you?"

?????: "I'm Skyward-"

?????: "And I'm Hayward."

Nathan: *He took a step forward and stopped himself.* (I just realised, what am I doing? I don't have a sword!)

Grey: "These Scoldrants, their Neurons have increased to concerning levels!"

Ordin: "Understood-"

Man: "It burns! My head!" *His eyes suddenly flashed an eerie yellow colour.*

Skyward: "As individuals, we contain no power-"

Hayward: "But together-"

Skyward and Hayward: "We form one of the four mighty guilds!" *They held hands, causing a red and blue glyph to simultaneously form under their feet.*

Ordin: *His image disappeared and he reappeared behind another hippo with his sword sheathed.* "Temporial Slash."

Hippo: "Kerar-" *Its body suddenly sliced into four pieces, causing Nathan to gasp.*

Skyward and Hayward: "We are twins! Together, we're The Seraphic Sunders!" *They raised their hands, causing streams of fire and water to string towards one hippo, scorching it in a tunnel of water.*

Luna: (Seraphic Sunders?) "Ain't they one of the top guild people?"

Nathan: "Yes-"

*Two Scoldrants suddenly rushed towards Luna and Nathan at incredible speeds.*

Luna: "Shit-" *She froze on the spot in shock.*

Nathan: "Tssk-" *He quickly grabbed Luna and pulled her towards him, out of the way.*

*The two Scoldrants jumped off the bridge, causing the party to gasp.*

Grey: "Lushes of aqua, crush, MERCURY BLAZE" *He waved his hand, causing an eruption of water-like fire to explode one of the falling Scoldrants.* "I missed one."

Nathan: *He watched the blue fire rain down in amazement.* (The ruler, he's a Rostical User?!)

Ordin: "Your majesty?" *He looked alert, watching the last Scoldrant jump a level down.*

Grey: "Hmm?" (This isn't good. If that Scoldrant reaches the residential area, things could get bad-)

Ordin: "I will go immediately!-"

Nathan: "The user.." *He formed fists, regretfully gritting his teeth.* "If you defeat him, it will stop the other Scoldrants."

Ordin: *He slowly turned around, staring at the man with an emotionless face.* "How did this happen?"

Man: "I-ck-" *He struggled to speak, as his eyes glowed an eerie yellow colour.* "This energy, I need to hurt something-"

Nathan: "And the corruption seeps in."

Luna: (He speaks from experience?)

--

Trevour: *He looked at Rachael with a smile.* "You're almost there, Lezard-"

Hippo: *It landed heavily on the ground and glared at Trevour, Karol, Lezard and Rachael, as if it was drawn to the light.* "Kerhhh!"

Karol: "Wh-ah?!" *He squealed in fright.*

Lezard: "Is Twortz back?"

Trevour: "How temperamental!" *He quickly stood in front of Lezard, causing his armour to rattle.*

Karol: "I-I whill halp!" *He stood up and kicked his boots on the ground, readying himself to fight.*

Trevour: "Its eyes?" (It's the same from previous encounters.. That means it's stronger than it should be-)

Hippo: "Kerrhnl!" *It suddenly charged towards Trevour, causing the ground to rumble.*

Karol: *He started to dance.* "Power-"

Hippo: "K-?!" *It tripped on its own foot and slid on its face, before bursting into tiny white orbs.*

Trevour: *He lowered his arms in confusion.* "What happened?"

Karol: "Harh?"

Lezard: "It ran out of batteries?" *He sounded confused.*

Rachael: "W-What's going on?" *She spoke on her breath, catching the party's attention.*

Karol: "Waichael!"

Trevour: "Boss!" *He smiled and turned around.*

Lezard: "Phew..." *He sighed and collapsed onto his back, taking a deep breath.* "I'm out, bwarharh."

Rachael: *She stared at the night sky with a saddened face.* (Twortz...)

----------

Ordin: *He watched the man choke, as he held his sword through his neck.* "It's over."

Man: "Thank.. You.." *He became limp, allowing Ordin to remove the sword from his neck.*

Destiny: "Yeup."

Luna: "So-" *She looked down to the next level where the Scoldrant jumped off.* "The Twotters look-a-like died too?"

Nathan: "Yes."

Luna: (Having a Soul Link.. It's kool, but it's still freaky as shit.) *She stood up straight and recollected herself.* (The lizard-like hippo things died because that guy did-)

Grey: "What is this phenomenon?! Someone, please respond."

Hayward: *She looked up to Grey who stood on a floating glyph.* "You are to say-"

Skyward: "You've never seen it?"

Grey: "I've seen it, but I had reason to believe it was just an ability."

Ordin: "I too have encountered this several times, but thought nothing more of it."

Luna: "Ah, why? That's somethin' worthy of tellin' your ruler, aye?"

Ordin: "There are many powers and abilities out there! Still many things we don't know-"

Grey: "Ordin, it's fine."

Ordin: "Your majesty." *He placed the sword over his shoulder, causing it to turn invisible.*

Grey: "Meet me at the research facility! I wish to know more about this." *He suddenly disappeared in a flash of purple light.*

Luna: "Let's go, let's see how Rachael is goin'." *She turned around and started to run across the bridge, causing Nathan to follow.*

----------

*Zazark suddenly appeared in a small well-lit cave, catching Tara's attention.*

Tara: "Ah, Zazark-..." *She paused and looked confused.* "Where are their heads?"

Zazark: *He threw his arm on the ground and staggered forward, dropping to his knees.* "Reattach it now!"

Tara: "Fufufu, what happened-?"

Zazark: "Before the Neurons seep out of it!" *He shouted, staring at his arm in a worried-like manner.*

Tara: *She shook her head and walked towards Zazark, kicking his arm into her hand.* "Tell me everything that happened."

----------

*Trevour and Nathan helped Rachael down the hallway, watching the rest of the party turn left to enter the research facility at the end of the hallway.*

Trevour: "Are you sure you're okay, boss?"

Rachael: "I'm fine. And when did you start calling me boss, hehe?"

Trevour: "I don't know." *He smiled, focusing his attention ahead.*

Nathan: "You can rest if you want?"

Rachael: "Hehe, no way! I need to know what's happening. It feels like I've been out for several days."

Nathan: "Hmph." *He smirked and walked into the research facility, watching Grey and Ordin talk to Dawn.*

Ordin: *He noticed Nathan, Trevour and Rachael enter the facility.* "Your majesty."

Grey: "Excellent-" *He stepped to the side, glancing at the entire party.* "Everyone is here-"

Ordin: "Nathan-"

Nathan: "Yes, sir?" *He spoke with growing nervousness.*

Lezard: (Is he nervous? That's unlike Nathan.)

Ordin: "Please explain everything you know about the yellow-eyed condition to Dawn."

Dawn: "Yes. With the power of research, I'll be able to help immensely." *She pushed her glasses up with two fingers, readying herself for Nathan's information.*

Nathan: "Well-"

----------

*Twortz snored and bobbed up and down, as the Scoldrant slowly came to a stop.*

Man: "This-ees the la-arst starp."

Twortz: *She snarled and shook her head, waking up to the sun rising.* "Where-?"

Man: "That is Sorrowpracks." *He nudged his head towards a large castle.*

Twortz: "I see." *She jumped off the ostrich and staggered several times, as if her legs were asleep.*

Man: "What about my pa-aai-ments?"

Twortz: "Consider leaving with your life as payment."

Man: *He frowned and adjusted his cowboy hat.* "Now, you listen he-ere-"

Twortz: "Listen?!" *She spoke with an echoing voice which rumbled like thunder.*

Man: "H-Have a nu-aice day!" *He kicked the ostrich, causing it to suddenly sprint the way he came.*

Twortz: "Sorrowprax." *She stared at the structure and felt the cool morning breeze blow past her.* "Hahahackee."

----------

Dawn: *She yawned and nodded her head.* "Yes."

Nathan: "That's all.."

Rachael: *She looked to her side, watching Karol and Luna sleep against each other in a hug-like manner.* "That's all?"

Nathan: "Yeah."

Grey: "Herm.. Going by what you're saying-"

Dawn: "Research tells me it's spreading."

Lezard: "Zzzz." *He slept over a chair which almost looked painful.*

Trevour: "Hrzzz." *He slept against the wall with his arms folded.*

Rachael: "W-Wait? This thing is spreading?" *She spoke loudly, accidentally waking Luna, Karol, Lezard and Trevour up from their unintentional nap.*

Lezard: "Send in the pineapples!" *He mumbled in his half asleep state.*

Luna: "Gah, wat time is it?" *She mumbled in exhaustion.*

Karol: "I-I'm tyard.." *He whined and rubbed his eyes.*

Dawn: "What are you talking about? Research says it's.. Morning?" *She sounded surprised.*

Grey: *He looked at Dawn and nodded his head.* "I've found this information interesting too. I've also lost track of time. I need to go immediately."

Trevour: "What's happening, boss?"

Rachael: "Well-"

Grey: "I fully support your quest in stopping this condition."

Nathan: *He looked up in shock.* "Your majesty?"

Grey: "Dawn, you are to help Nathan with anything he requires for this quest."

Dawn: "With all respect, your highness." *She slightly bowed.* "My research load is already vast-"

Grey: "And if this condition harms my city in any manner, should I hold you and your research to blame?"

Dawn: "I-I see.. Of course."

Grey: "Excellent. Also-" *He waved his hand across the party, causing small glyphs to appear around their pinky fingers.*

Lezard: "Ooo, a glyphic ring?"

Rachael: *She observed her pinky with a smile.* (It looks like I'm wearing a ring, but it's a tattoo? That's wicked. I could never wear rings because of my training-)

Trevour: "What does this do, your majesty sir?"

Grey: "This will grant you access to and out the city without the need of one of my special keys."

Luna: "Kool."

Grey: "Also, in times, the castle's doors will be locked. These glyphs will allow entrance to you."

Rachael: "Hehe, neat."

Nathan: "I guess-" *He turned around and faced the party with a smile.* "I'll stay at the island a little while longer."

Luna: "Really?" *She smiled in happiness, causing Destiny to purr.*

Nathan: "Well, I should take advantage of this honourable offer." *He spoke in a deep voice and looked away with blushing cheeks.*

Lezard: "Naww, just kiss already-"

Nathan and Luna: "Shut up!"

Lezard: "Ouchies!" *He covered his head as if he was about to get hurt.*

Grey: "Rachael, Nathan, Lezard, Trevour, Luna, and Karol." *He spoke with authority, drawing all their attention towards him.* "I have recognised your abilities and skill."

Ordin: "Herm?" *He mumbled in curiosity and glanced at Grey, as if he wasn't expecting him to say that.*

Nathan: *He instinctively dropped down to one knee, lowering his head.* (To be recognised by the ruler of Silver Wind Island.. What an amazing feeling!)

Rachael: *She looked at Nathan, causing her to do the same.* (Bowing down to royalty, this feels really strange.)

Lezard: *He glanced at the party and dropped down to one knee.* "Razzypoo, Loonamotto, Trevmeister, and our little hero all bowed down to his highness in respect."

Grey: "Ordin." *He spoke as if he was ready to leave.*

Ordin: "Ready."

Luna: "If we can't go home.. Wat are we gonna do?" *She whispered under her breath, as she stared at the floor.*

Grey: "Dawn, if you or Nathan come up with anything, let me know." *He clicked his fingers and a purple light flashed.*

Rachael: *She looked up, noticing Grey and Ordin were gone.* "Oh-?"

Dawn: *She yawned and waved the party out.* "Alright, all of you get refreshed, clean yourselves, sleep, whatever you do. Just leave my facility already."

Trevour: "Heh heh, a nap sounds good to me."

Lezard: *He stretched and started to leave.* "Thankies, my darling lady-"

Dawn: "Out!" *She spoke with a smile.*

Rachael: "Thank you for having us."

Dawn: "Research is always open for those who wish to learn."

Luna: "Wateva." *She rolled her eyes and shuffled her feet down the hallway.*

Karol: "Waichael?" *He pulled on Rachael's hand, as he slowly left the facility.*

Dawn: *She rubbed her eyes under her glasses.* (This is a lot to take in.. A possible epidemic-?)

Researcher: "Dawn?"

Dawn: "Back to research!" *She quickly turned around, unintentionally yelling in a tired-like manner.*

Researcher: "Ma'am!"

Nathan: *He walked with the party down the hallway.* (Having access to their research and Rosterology devices.. This will help my search for the disease so much easier-)

Lezard: "Ah, it's been a long day, hasn't it, little monsters?"

Rachael: "What happened with Twortz?"

Luna: "Twotters went crazy, kicked your ass and left the city."

Trevour: "Well, that's one way to put it." *He spoke in disagreement.* "I would've put it in a nicer manner and without the swearing-"

Luna: "Fuck. Fuck. Fuck."

Rachael: "Hey, Luna-" *She covered Karol's ears, as they walked down the stairs.* "Not cool."

Luna: *She nodded her head in understanding.* "My bad, aye."

Trevour: "It feels like our adventure is coming close to an end."

Lezard: "Close to an end? Foolish.. It's just beginning." *He giggled and hopped off the stairs, hobbling down the hallway.*

Luna: "Hey, we must be gettin' a little fitter. I remember sweatin' just by walkin' up those stairs, aye." *She looked up to her forehead with a satisfying smile, implying she wasn't sweating.*

Destiny: "Yeup!"

Rachael: "Do you know a place to bathe? I want a nice warm shower before bed.."

Trevour: "But it's day?"

Nathan: "Unlike you, she actually stayed awake."

Trevour: "Right you are, sorry boss."

Lezard: "Razzypoo, you should ask one of the people that work for Grey-" *He looked down the hallway, noticing people in white carrying dirty blankets.*

Rachael: "Will do, thanks." *She smiled at each party member and started to jog towards a woman in white.*

Luna: "Once I start snorin', wake me up and you'll be soarin'." *She grunted in a threatening manner and walked into the room they used before, noticing someone already sleeping in a bed.* "Oi!-"

Man: "H-Huh?" *He moaned and leant up.*

Luna: "Get out now!"

Man: *He looked at Luna like she was an idiot.* "Herherh, yeah right-"

Destiny: "Hsssht!" *She hissed, glaring at the man with her large bug-like eyes.*

Man: "Whoa!-" *He quickly jumped out of bed and ran out of the room, accidentally knocking on Trevour's armour.* "Ah-" *He grunted, as if hitting Trevour's armour hurt.*

Trevour: "Have a pleasant day, sir."

Luna: "Fucking pussy." *She yawned, shuffling her feet towards the bed.*

Destiny: "Yeu.." *She meowed in a tired-like manner, watching the party lie on the beds.*

Luna: "Oi, close your eyes, I can't get to sleep."

Destiny: "Yeup." *She curled up into a ball and closed her eyes, sleeping on Luna's stomach.*

Lezard: "Sleepy time!" *He skipped towards a vacant bed and shook his bottom before jumping on top of it.* "Good night-, I mean, good morning, everyone!" *He giggled and quickly fell asleep.*

Trevour: "You too, sir." *He spoke in the pillow, as he rested on his belly.*

Karol: *He watched the party fall asleep in different positions, causing him to look down to his boots in thought.* (I whant to do something..)

*Karol quietly hopped off the bed and slowly shuffled out of the room, making his way out of the castle.*

----------

*Rachael was led into a tiled facility with many small cubicles, listening to her footsteps echo.*

Woman: "Don't be alarmed, the moment your garments touch the floor, the glyph will absorb it and wash them."

Rachael: "Wicked."

Woman: *She smiled and nudged her head towards a cubicle, causing Rachael to walk towards it.* "Don't fret if you can't use Rostical, the glyphs will respond to your life Neurons."

Rachael: *She stepped into the cubicle, causing a black glyph to spiral behind her.* "Huh?" *She watched the glyph spew darkness, acting as a black wall.*

*Rachael started to take off her clothes, revealing her bare, smooth skin, causing the black glyph to suction all her clothes.*

Rachael: *She instinctively placed one arm around her chest and stepped further into the cubicle, noticing thick, black glyphs painted on the tiled walls, each with different designs.* "There's no taps?"

*Rachael shrugged her shoulders and placed one hand on a black glyph, causing strings of water to swirl around her.*

Rachael: "Wow-" *She suddenly jumped as the water swayed across her back.* "Cold-"

Woman: *She collected dirty towels off the floor, smiling at Rachael's reaction.* "First time?"

Rachael: "Y-Yeah, the water's a little cold."

Woman: "The glyph adjusts the water's temperature to your thoughts."

Rachael: *She concentrated, causing the water to visibly steam.* "Wicked! Thanks!"

Woman: "Any time." *She smiled and started to leave.* "Once you're finished, your garments should be cleaned."

Rachael: *She watched water stream all around her from the glyphs.* (The water is coming out from all the glyphs-)

*Rachael smiled and tilted her head down, keeping one hand on the glyph.*

Rachael: (What's happening? It feels like, I'm in this too deep to back away now.. I don't know what to do.. It's not like me to back away or give up.. You can only keep moving forward.. I'm just uneasy about my situation, because.. This is it? Will it be for the better, or..?)

Chapter 12: The Guild

*Karol skipped into the castle, causing the doors to ripple around him like water.*

Karol: "Nee hee." *He walked into the room and noticed the party half asleep.* "'Scuse me?"

*Karol eagerly glanced to each side, noticing no response.*

Karol: (Uhm-) *He took a deep breath.* "Halp!"

*Nathan, Trevour, Lezard and Luna leant up and looked at Karol with urgency, as if they were ready to chase after someone.*

Karol: "U-Uhm-" *He silently looked away, as if he was suddenly nervous.*

Luna: "You woke us up, little shit. Wat is it?"

Destiny: "Yeup?"

Rachael: "What's going on?" *She dried her hair and stood behind Karol.*

Karol: "Everywon, pwease come!" *He grabbed Rachael's hand and started to walk away.*

Nathan: "I'm staying here-"

Luna: *She hit Nathan in the stomach, as she walked past him.* "If I have to go, so do you."

Nathan: "Argh, whatever." *He mumbled in defeat and leant up, scratching the back of his head.*

Lezard: *He stepped outside, looking intrigued.* "What's happening?"

Trevour: "It's already afternoon? We've almost slept the day away."

Rachael: "Where are we going?"

Karol: "Up here!" *He spoke with growing excitement and ran up the stairs, causing Rachael to awkwardly follow.*

Lezard: "This is suspenseful! I wonder where we're being taken."

Karol: "Nee hee-"

Luna: "If it's nowhere special, I'm goin' to strangle you."

Karol: "A-Ah.."

Rachael: "She's joking."

Karol: "O-Oh."

Luna: "Yup, jokin'." *She smirked evil-like, causing Karol to quickly look back in front.*

Nathan: *He stretched and yawned, walking across the bridge.* "I would've preferred not to wake up during the night."

Trevour: "I agree, sir."

Rachael: "I just wanted to say, if you're wanting to head to the entertainment area, you're not going in."

Karol: *He stopped and shook his head with a smile, listening to flags flap in the breeze.* "Nup."

Trevour: *He stared at the two storey wooden building in confusion.* "The Guild's Silver Tavern?"

Luna: "Wat about it?"

Lezard: "Naww, are you thinking what I'm thinking, sausage monster?" *He giggled, looking at Trevour.*

Trevour: "Something involving the guilds?"

Lezard: "No! I'm craving seaside soup!"

Trevour: "Err?"

Luna: "We've already seen this place before, aye." *She grunted with growing frustration.*

Rachael: "Karol-" *She bent down.* "You can't get all of us to check things out-"

Karol: "No-" *He shook his head and took a deep breath, trying to maintain his braveness.* "I want us to cweate a guild!"

Trevour: "Create a guild? You mean join a guild?"

Karol: "Nup! Create!"

Rachael: "Can we create a guild?"

Lezard: "I wouldn't have a clue."

Nathan: "I see no reason why we couldn't."

Karol: "I dhid some wesearch, and we can!"

Luna: "Now the question is, why do we want to?" *She spoke in a bitchy manner, as if she was upset she was woken up.*

Lezard: "Even I have to agree with Loonzamotto. If I don't maintain my beauty sleep, this-" *He waved his arms around his face.* "Couldn't happen."

Karol: "Because..."

Luna: "Waitin'.." *She tapped her foot with a growing frown.*

Karol: "Because-.."

Trevour: "Little meister?"

Luna: *She rolled her eyes and started to walk away.* "Catchyas-"

Karol: "Because we have no home!"

Luna: "A-Aye?" *She sounded shocked, causing Destiny to widen her eyes for Luna.*

Rachael: "Karol?"

Nathan: "..."

Karol: "None of us have homes.. I figured.. If we cweated a guild.. It could be our home."

Luna: "Naww!"

Rachael: (Hehe, wow-)

Karol: "Waichael, Loona, you tooh can't get back to your home, Twevour, you've eskaped from the warriors, where is your home? Nafan, you might have a twibe, but, where is your home? Wezard-"

Lezard: "Ooo! It's my heart warming turn!"

Karol: "You're funny, stay wif us!"

Lezard: "Naww, the feels." *He placed his hands on his chest, looking at Karol, as if he was about to cry.*

Karol: "So.. I fink we should make our own home."

Nathan: "..."

Karol: "We'll create a guild, we'll form our own family! We'll help each other.. Stick by one anover."

Rachael: (Something so deep.. This boy-)

Karol: "You all make me happy.." *He looked down, staring at his boots.*

Luna: *She smiled with watering eyes.* (This little shit.)

Karol: "Until we find our homes-" *He looked up and glanced at each party member.* "We should form our own."

Nathan: "Hmph." *He grunted in respect.* "The first manly thing I've heard you say."

Karol: "N-Nafan?"

Nathan: "This will solve our money problem if we wish to stay in a place such a Silver Wind Island." *He mumbled in a deep voice and smiled, symbolising he liked the idea.*

Trevour: (Alan.. You're part of The Blazing Trio-) "I'd like to prove myself. I'd like to create a guild too."

Rachael: "Hehe, count me in."

Luna: *She wiped her eyes, hiding her emotional response to Karol's speech.* "Pssht, wateva. I'd have nothin' to do if I don't join, aye."

Destiny: "Yeup!"

Lezard: "You'll need a healer, I guess I can take that honourable role-"

Karol: "Of course! Without you, we'd be in big twouble!"

Lezard and Luna: "Naww."

Karol: "Bhut! We need a captain."

Rachael: "A captain?"

Karol: *He nodded his head and turned around to face the tavern.* "Evewy guild has a leader."

Lezard: "I vote Rachael!"

Trevour: "I vote the boss too."

Nathan: "Why not?" *He mumbled in agreement.*

Luna: "Don't ya wanna be the leader?"

Nathan: "I'm not interested in that position yet." *He spoke with a smile.* "You?"

Luna:"Pssht, I don't want the responsibility, aye."

Karol: "Yes, for Waichael!-"

Rachael: "Don't I get a say? I think Karol should be the leader."

Karol: "M-Me?"

Nathan: "What are we going to call ourselves?"

Lezard: "The Delicious Cupcake Warriors!-"

Nathan, Luna and Trevour: "No."

Lezard: "Oh.."

Rachael: "What about The Mighty Guild?"

Karol: "Too gen-er-.. Ick?" *He tried his best to sound out the word.*

Lezard: "I agree. The Might Guild sounds rather boring.. Maybe change the word mighty?"

Trevour: "What about, The Neuron Guild?"

Rachael: "Nope."

Luna: "The Magic Guild!"

Rachael: "Hmm?" *She looked up, as if she was saying Luna's suggestion in her head.*

Trevour: "Majick, madam?"

Rachael: "She means Rostical."

Luna: *She snapped her fingers.* "What about, The Rostickal Guild?!"

Rachael: "Hey, I like that." *She smiled for confirmation.*

Karol: "Nee hee, I like it."

Trevour: "So do I, heh heh."

Lezard: "It's got a powerful essence to it."

Nathan: "..."

Luna: *She looked at Nathan, as if she was annoyed he hadn't spoken yet.* "Wat 'bout you, dick cheese?"

Destiny: "Yeup."

Trevour: *He looked at Nathan in a worried-like manner.* (The Rostical Guild, I forgot.. That's a title-)

Nathan: "I don't accept that name."

Luna: "Oh wat? Because I made it?"

Nathan: "No, because it gives us a title."

Karol: "W-What do you mean, Nafan?"

Nathan: "They're the Rostical people.." *He spoke as if someone else was saying it.* "I don't like it. It's giving us a title-"

Rachael: "Well.." *She smiled.*

Nathan: "What?"

Rachael: "You could use that to your advantage."

Nathan: "How could I?"

Rachael: "They'd expect us to be Rostical Users, right?"

Nathan: "Yeah?"

Rachael: "Well, they brace themselves for some Rostical, then you strike them off guard with your sword skills?"

Luna: "Yea! They're like, fireballs come at me, and you're like, laugh out loud, jokes, whip slash!" *She spoke the entire sentence while moving her arms, portraying imagery.*

Lezard: "Five out of seven for choreography."

Luna: "Just a five?!" *She raised a fist in Lezard's face.*

Lezard: "Ouchies, not the face or goods!"

Nathan: "Hmph, that sounds like an excellent idea."

Trevour: "Really?" *He spoke on his breath.*

Rachael: "Hehe, awesome to hear." *She smiled in happiness.*

Nathan: "Their own fault for thinking I'm a Rostical User."

Rachael: "Wicked!"

Karol: "To the start of our new famwily!" *He squealed and pointed forward towards the door.*

Rachael: (People sometimes underestimate the innocence of a child's mind.) *She walked across the wooden veranda and pushed the door open, causing it to swing open like a pub's door.*

Trevour: *He watched the four flags flap in the non-existent breeze.* (I wonder if I'll see you again, brothers and sister-)

Lezard: "Ooo-" *He skipped inside, glancing to each side.*

Luna: *She noticed large looking men with glyphic tattoos all over their arms.* "It's seriously like a pub."

Nathan: *He looked up, noticing a second floor with wooden railings which looked over the first floor.* "This is my kind of place."

Trevour: (But not really mine.) *He looked uncomfortable, watching people drinking from tables.*

Rachael: "You're seventeen, Luna. How do you know what a pub looks like?"

Luna: "Really, goody-goody? There's non-alcoholic pubs? And besides, you don't know the half of wat I got up to, aye."

Rachael: "True-"

Luna: "False." *She grunted, as if she was annoyed at Rachael.*

Lezard: *He walked up to the desk-like bar, noticing benches of bottles and a large whiteboard with different listings on it.* "What are the listings for?"

Barkeeper: *She cleaned out a large cup and glanced at the whiteboard.* "That's the price you get for completing the guild's quest."

Rachael: "Cool."

Karol: "Each request has differwent rewards. Some even haf items for the reward."

Nathan: "Twelve thousand dollars for defeating Scoldrants?! Why didn't I do this sooner?!"

Barkeeper: "Because joining a guild is much harder than one might think. And to create a guild, you need a minimum of six people at all times."

Rachael: "At all times?"

Nathan: "What if someone has a personal agenda to take care of?"

Barkeeper: "I mean, if one dies, leaving your guild down to five people, you'll have a few days to find another person."

Lezard: "Jinkies! And if we don't?"

Barkeeper: "You lose all credibility to your guild."

Luna: "That's a little harsh."

Barkeeper: "Welcome to the guilds!" *She raised the empty glass for a cheers before placing it under the counter.* "And besides, to make the big bucks, you need your guild to be well known."

Trevour: "What do you mean, miss?"

Barkeeper: "These missions or requests are up for grabs to any guild, but if you're well known, people could come up to you personally."

Karol: "That's so amayzing!" *He spoke in excitement.*

Lezard: *He watched Karol fidget on the spot, as if he had trouble controlling himself.* (The gradual build up of excitement has reached child-like levels-)

Karol: *He glanced at the party.* "What if we make ourselves known? We could be faymous."

Rachael: "Yeah!" *She smiled at Karol and looked at the barkeeper.* "We'd like to create a guild."

Barkeeper: *She paused and stared at the party, as if they were joking.* "That would mean all six of you have to be here?"

Lezard: "But we are, scary lady."

Barkeeper: "The child?"

Trevour: *He paused in understanding.* "Is there a rule regarding age, madam?"

Barkeeper: ".. No."

Luna: "Then let's do this, aye."

Lezard: "And quickly, people keep staring at us." *He whispered as if something was behind him.*

Trevour: "Sorry, I don't feel comfortable talking to you without knowing your name, miss?"

Barkeeper: "They call me Keeper."

Trevour: "Oh.."

Luna: "Aha, shot down, bro."

Lezard: "Ooo! The keeper to my heart?"

Keeper: *She glanced to each side, as if she was maintaining eye contact with several guilds in case something bad happened.* "Starting a guild is a huge responsibility."

Luna: "Wat's so hard about makin' a guild?"

Keeper: "If you fail, your image will impact other guilds."

Nathan: "What's the worst that's ever happened?"

Keeper: *She started to clean another dirty cup.* "One new guild thought it would've been smart to handle an S classed request."

Karol: "A what cklassed wequest?"

Rachael: "I'm guessing S classed missions would be the hardest?"

Keeper: "Yes. The rewards are worth the danger though."

Nathan: "What kind of rewards or we talking?"

Keeper: "I've seen some go up to a few million."

Lezard: "Ooo! A new mansion for Lezard please!"

Luna: "Ah-, no. And stop talkin' in third person, aye."

Lezard: "Ouchies-"

Trevour: "Please continue with the story, miss."

Keeper: "Needless to say, they failed, got caught by the Consultants and died, all for their publicity."

Rachael: *She looked at Trevour in shock.* "Is that true?"

Trevour: "I'm not sure what she's talking about, but yes, they do that all the time."

Rachael: "That's sickening."

Keeper: "Shortly after that, the guild's work in that city declined rapidly and had to migrate. The family of the guilds that ruined work for the other guilds, seemed to find themselves in danger quite often."

Karol: "I dhon't understand? Why were they in danger?"

Rachael: "Karol-" *She bent down and whispered in Karol's ear, causing his eyes to widen in understanding.*

Keeper: "So, you still want to do this?"

Lezard: "Yuppers!"

Trevour: "Boss?" *He looked at Rachael.*

Rachael: "Yes!"

Keeper: "Who'll be the guild leader?"

Luna, Nathan, Trevour, Lezard and Karol: "Rach-"

Rachael: "Karol Upper!"

Keeper: "Alright-" *She reached into a small leather pouch and pulled out a black texture, ignoring everyone else's responses.* "With the glyphic markings, what is your guild's sigil?!"

Luna: "Wait, wat?"

Rachael: "We have to do a sigil?"

Trevour: "I don't have a clue."

Lezard: "Neither do I, Trevmeister."

Karol: "Nee hee-" *He stood on his toes, barely reaching the counter top and grabbed the texture.* "We are The Rostical Guild!"

*Karol drew a circular glyph and a sword across it, causing the party to cluster closer towards him.*

Rachael: (The texture markings are drawn on the air itself? That's awesome!)

Trevour: "What's this, little meister?"

Karol: "I planned this for our sigil a while ago."

Lezard: "Just how long were you planning this, secretive little sausage!"

Karol: "Nee hee. A while now. And this sigil symbol.. Symbolsizes our Remenistal and a warrior's heart."

Lezard, Luna and Rachael: "Naww."

Nathan: *He placed his hands on his head and looked away with an approving smile.* "That's our sigil."

Karol: "Yup!"

Keeper: *She swayed her hand around the sigil and threw it behind her, causing the sigil to appear on another whiteboard with lines of small sigils.* "Done."

Trevour: "Done?"

Karol: "S-So.. We're-?"

Keeper: "You're all officially a guild!"

Lezard: "Yay, we're no longer a party, but a guild!"

Karol: "H-Holy Neurons? We did it?"

Luna: "Why is everyone so excited? This process seems too ridiculously easy-"

Rachael: "It's not the process, but the result."

Trevour: "We're a family."

Luna: "If anyone calls me sister, I'll punch 'em in the face."

Nathan: "Well-" *He smirked, as if he wanted to try.*

Keeper: *He stepped to the side and pointed at a large bulletin board with different slips of paper next to the bar.* "It's a tradition for new guilds to choose a mission."

Trevour: "May I, everyone?"

Rachael: "Go for it." *She smiled and watched Trevour lean forward, glancing at each bulletin-like slips of paper.*

Trevour: "A rescue mission, heh heh." *He turned around with a smile, as if he wanted to do that.*

Luna: "Wat's it 'bout?"

Trevour: "Well-" *He tilted his head, as he tried to read it.*

Keeper: *She casually ripped the piece of paper off the whiteboard, as if she's done it many times.* "Retrieve a farmer's lost Scoldrant."

Rachael: "Sounds easy enough for our first quest?"

Luna: "Sounds lame a shit."

Nathan: "What's the reward?"

Trevour: "Let's see.. Two thousand."

Nathan: "That's almost a month's worth of-" *He started to get excited and faced the door, as if he was ready to leave.*

Luna: "You're easily sold."

Destiny: "Yeup."

Nathan: "Hmph."

Karol: "Alright, let's go!"

Rachael: "What's our guild, on three?"

Lezard: "Ooo." *He waved his bottom in excitement.*

Rachael: "One, two, three-"

Luna: "The Guild of Fully Sick People-"
Trevour and Rachael: "The Rostical Guild!-"
Lezard: "The Flavoursome Heroes!"
Nathan: "The Mighty Guild."
Karol: "The Remenistal Guild."

*The guild shouted their announcements at the same time, causing several different guild members to look at them strangely.*

Lezard: "Let's leave, their eyes are condescending on me." *He squealed like a girl and ran out of the tavern.*

Luna: "Aha, wat a dork."

Rachael: "Hehe. Now we're stuck with him." *She listened to the guild's footsteps on the wooden floor, as they left the tavern.*

Trevour: "Heh heh. We're lucky to have a healer-"

Nathan: *He quickly nudged Trevour, stopping him in mid-sentence.* "It would be good to keep that on a down low."

Trevour: "Sure thing, sir." *He smiled and stepped outside onto the wooden veranda.*

Lezard: *He smiled, watching the guild gather around him.* "Naww, to our new home."

Karol: "Nee hee." *He smiled and turned around, facing the two storey tavern in determination.*

Rachael: (And with a seven-year-old boy.. We began a new chapter of our lives.)

Nathan: "Let's start this mission already!" *He spoke with excitement and started to jog away, causing the guild to follow with their individual chuckles.*

----------

*Twortz dressed in warrior's armour walked down a dirt path inside a forest, holding a large wooden cross in one hand.*

Twortz: (Joining the warriors was much easier than I thought. I acted obedient, strong, professional and now, I'm number two hundred and forty-three.)

*Twortz walked towards the light at the end of the dirt path and stepped into a clearing.*

Twortz: (Dropping down the ranks is harder than I thought. Even though I haven't displayed any of my true power, dropping down a measly fourteen positions in over a month.. Not tolerable.)

*Twortz walked towards a different coloured patch of soft appearing dirt and suddenly rammed the wooden cross into it.*

Twortz: "This is to you-" *She dropped to her knees and cupped her hands, causing her armour to rattle.* "This is where I lost a good friend."

*Twortz tilted her head down, placing her cupped hands against her forehead.*

Twortz: "Rachael. This is where you rest.." *She suddenly opened her eyes, triggering images of PKMY's face.* "I promise you, I'll avenge you, and I will kill PKMY."

*Twortz slowly stood up and glared into the distance, forming fists.*

Twortz: "I need to get stronger without drawing suspicion to the other warriors." *She whispered to herself, triggering a flashback.*

----------

Twortz: "..." *She silently followed Karol.*

Rachael: "What does that mean?"

Karol: "This city responds to dancing or singing."

Twortz: "How utterly ridiculous! If I were to start singing-, lalalalala-"

*The ground around Twortz responded to her voice, causing a large glyph to shake.*

Karol: "S-Stahp! You'll activate the city's defences!"

Twortz: "Ckee-" *She quickly covered her mouth in shock, watching the ground revert back to normal.*

Rachael: "Lalalala." *She sung on a high note, noticing nothing happened.*

Lezard: "Dun-, dun, duuuun. You failed."

Karol: "W-Why did yooh do that?!"

Rachael: "Sorry, Karol. I was curious."

Twortz: "Although that was very irresponsible, why did nothing happen?"

Karol: "She isn't a Score User like yourself."

Millard: "Ooo, sing us a heart warming song."

Twortz: "I don't know how to."

Rachael: "You know how to sing, Twortz."

Twortz: "Tsst-"

Millard: "You seem confused, child?"

Twortz: "I am far from a child, thank you."

Lezard: "She's right. She's very boring."

Millard: "Bahahah, okay." *He smiled and continued to follow Karol.*

Rachael: "You learnt a few new techniques, Twortz."

Twortz: "They are quite similar in my opinion."

Karol: "Maybe, but each have their own harhmonick freakency."

----------

Twortz: "Captain classed warriors, their power is unimaginable." *She recalled people flashstepping and using different types of Rostical.* "I've got a secluded place to train-"

*Twortz started to walk across the clearing, recalling her entire adventure.*

Twortz: "I already tried to get access regarding the captains, or Sorrowprax's database. Turns out you need to be a captain-"

--

Trevour: "Me? Oh no, heh heh. Captains usually wear platinum armour, not black or grey."

Twortz: "How do you become a captain?"

Trevour: "By rising up the ranks."

Twortz: "What if someone was really powerful, would they take over another captain?"

Trevour: "What do you mean?"

Twortz: "Well, bumping them out of captain ranking."

Trevour: "That's not possible."

Twortz: "That's it? Not possible at all?"

Trevour: "Well-" *He looked up in thought.* "Perhaps if the Consultant issued some sort of ranking change, it just doesn't happen."

Twortz: "So, the person just sits at vice captain level?"

Trevour: *He paused and tilted his head to the side.* "Well.."

Twortz: "Well, what?"

Trevour: "You could always challenge a captain."

Twortz: "And take their ranking?"

Trevour: "In a sense."

Twortz: "I'm not a person that likes to talk around the bush. Tell me straight up please."

Trevour: "Well, if you fight a captain to the death, you'll take their ranking that way."

Twortz: "I see."

Trevour: "Why? What is with these unusual questions? Are you planning to fight a captain?"

Twortz: "Hahackee, no. I was curious."

Trevour: "Heh heh, that's good. You'd need to be way stronger than you are now to even fight in a captain levelled battle."

----------

*Twortz smiled to herself and listened to her armour rattle, as she listened to the faint sounds of waves crashing in the far distance.*

Twortz: "Time to start honing my skills, at The Ruins of Estel, hahahackee!"

----------

*Ridley walked down a long stone hallway, listening to another two sets of footsteps behind him.*

Ridley: "What do you think of Sorrowprax, ladies?"

Trinity: "It's built very well."

Infinity: "And very well build it is."

Ridley: "How is it, people as young as you wield such power?"

Trinity: "By our parent's blood and the power of twins."

Infinity: "Twins indeed."

Ridley: "Intriguing." *He suddenly stopped with a gasp, causing Trinity and Infinity to shuffle behind him in confusion.*

Trinity: "What is the matter, master?"

Infinity: "A matter it must be?"

Ridley: "Gabby.." *He spoke on his breath and quickly turned around, facing the twin sisters.* "We are to go."

Trinity: "..."

Infinity: "Sister?"

Ridley: "Remember, if you want to save your beloved parents and friends, do what I say."

Trinity: (For everyone..) *She nodded her head and pretended to smile which looked real.*

Infinity: "We are ready, for our friends and family." *She reached out, allowing Ridley to grab her hand.*

Trinity: (Friends and family-) *She thought in agreement and hesitantly reached her arm out, opening her hand.*

Ridley: *He smiled at the twins.* (It's a shame I couldn't have any of the master dancers, but these powerful children could be useful.. I'll mould them to my will and in time, perhaps even forget why they're doing this? Hahaha, the folly!)

*Ridley grabbed the twin's hands and suddenly puffed into black smoke, leaving behind fading shadow-like strings of smoke.*

----------

*A young Asian man dressed in royal-like garbs walked inside a gigantic well, which was lit by a natural eerie green colour.*

?????: *He looked up, staring at a gigantic glyph which covered the ceiling above him.* "This is The Elemental Tower's hidden chamber-"

*A woman with long black hair ran into the well, watching the man look down into another well.*

Woman: "Klaus, stop! Please respond!"

Klaus: "... Ginger, you should not have come."

Ginger: "Please!" *She screamed with emotion.*

Klaus: "Forgive me-" *He stopped and stepped on his side, straightening his arm at Ginger.* "ICE STREAM DIVIDER"

*A blue glyph spiralled in front of Klaus' hand and a sudden shot of ice blasted towards Ginger, leaving a spiralling trail of mist behind it.*

Ginger: *She watched streams of sand swirl up from the ground and form into a boulder, suddenly blasting towards the cannon shaped ice.* "COMET'S VEIL" *She watched fire spurt on the sides of the boulder, giving it the illusion it was a comet.*

*The comet-like boulder collided into the ice cannon shot, both smashing into pebbles and water.*

Klaus: *He focused his attention to the well, as if Ginger wasn't a problem.* "With this.. I'll be able to tap into the strongest power to have ever of existed!"

Ginger: "That power, it's the planet's!"

Klaus: "Negative! I deserve to use this power to finish off my last task!"

Ginger: "Stop talking like that-"

Klaus: "I won't ever see his little face again, do you know how much it hurts?! Please respond!"

Ginger: "..."

Klaus: "If I do this, then nobody else will have to suffer."

Ginger: "Despite your reasoning, you can't use the planet's power-"

Klaus: "I can!" *He shouted and leant over the well, watching aurora coloured liquids swirl on the bottom.*

Ginger: "Please..." *She pulled her robes up, revealing different coloured tattoo-like glyphs all over her arm.*

Klaus: "These are the ultimate power.. Aurorions-"

Ginger: "Niklauseh-"

Klaus: "You are very power.. The wielder of all elemental affinities, except-" *He turned around and straightened his arm, causing swirls of darkness to envelop his hand.*

Ginger: "I don't need Shadiatons or Radiatons!"

Klaus: "And that is why I'm the strongest Susanoo!"

Ginger: *She shook her head.* "Niklauseh.. I just desire my older brother back."

Klaus: "Allow me to harness its power and I will be back soon!"

Ginger: "I can't allow you to do that."

Klaus: "I figured out the origin of the yellow-eyed symptom."

Ginger: *She gasped in shock.* "That's not possible!"

Klaus: "It was an entity. It's not a disease or a contaminant."

Ginger: "But it is a contagion?"

Klaus: "I've only seen this type of corruption from two things."

Ginger: "Why are you only revealing this now?!"

Klaus: "It doesn't matter who knows.. I will find its origins and completely obliterate it!"

Ginger: ".. So, what is it? Please respond."

Klaus: "It's infected Radiatons or Shadiatons."

Ginger: "How could they be infected?"

Klaus: "I do not know right now." *He placed his hand down the well and focused, causing strings of aurora to swirl up the well, lighting up the area.*

Ginger: "Stop, Niklauseh!"

Klaus: "Yes, I can feel it."

Ginger: "No!" *She tapped on a yellow glyph with her finger and pointed it at Klaus, causing a massive yellow glyph to rotate in front of her.*

Klaus: "You will attack your own brother?"

Ginger: "If father knew of this plan of yours-"

Klaus: "He'd do nothing! Like he did nothing when my son was dying!"

Ginger: *She hesitated with emotion and pushed her arm towards the glyph.* "LIGHTNING BLAST"

*Ginger blasted a bright yellow stream of lightning towards Klaus, listening to rumbling thunder echo from the glyph.*

Klaus: "NIGHT SPHERE" *A swirl of shadow formed a sphere around him, blocking the lightning.*

Ginger: *She listened to the lightning screech against the shield, as if it was glass on glass.* (He's grown this powerful?)

Klaus: *The strings of aurora swirled inside his chest, mouth and eyes.* "A-Ah?!"

Ginger: "Niklauseh?!" *She lowered her arm, causing the lightning to flash away.*

Klaus: "Yohohoho. Yes.." *The black shield suddenly burst into an arch of aurora.*

Ginger: *Her face glittered different colours from the aurora shield.* "What have you done?"

Klaus: "I love you, and father, but if you get in my way again, I will eradicate you too."

Ginger: "That makes no sense, brother. You say you do this because of what happened to your son, yet, you're willing to hurt your own family!? Please respond!"

Klaus: "You don't understand. Ougi."

Ginger: "O-Ougi?!"

Klaus: "Eclipsing Typhoon."

Ginger: "Why-?!" *She screamed as the entire area around her turned into complete darkness.* "Why?" *Her voice suddenly echoed, as if she was in a hall.*

Klaus: *He clicked his fingers, causing the darkness to suddenly and violently swirl around Ginger, cutting her skin.* "..."

Ginger: "Yorh-?" *She coughed out blood and ignored the numerous cuts that continuously appeared all over her body.*

Klaus: "I ponder what my new Ougi will become?" *He turned around and suddenly disappeared in a flash of aurora colours.*

*The swirling shadows puffed into smoke, allowing Ginger to drop to her knees.*

Ginger: "No..." *She collapsed onto her side and stared at the wall with an emotionless face.* "I've lost you again, brother."

*The light in the well faded, leaving Ginger in complete darkness.*

Ginger: "The life.. You've stolen the planet's power.. Without the nourishments, the energy of the planet will fade."

*Ginger spoke with a frail voice, as a tear streaked across her face.*

Ginger: "... Niklauseh, I do not understand the logic in your decision."

----------

*Lezard watched the waves crash around Silver Wind Island, enjoying the cool sea breeze which blew against his face.*

Lezard: "Good gravy, what to say, father monster? It's been an unexpected while since I last heard from you."

*Lezard looked up and smiled, as his significantly longer hair swayed in the breeze.*

Lezard: "Our little Karol practised his dance skills."

--

*Karol started to dance in The Hall of Oats and he kicked the ground, causing a bright orange glyph to expand from his foot.*

Karol: (I have to keep practising!)

Lezard: "His drive is very admirable, I remember he'd be in that hall for months.. Sometimes even too exhausted to come on our guild adventures-"

Karol: *He suddenly kicked the glyph, causing it to spiral off the ground and to change colour.* "W-What is this?"

Lezard: "If I didn't get my wisdom from you, father monster, I would've been surprised by his new techniques."

Karol: "Nee hee! I'm doing it.." *He spoke in determination and tried to step to the side, causing him to trip over his own feet.*

Lezard: "Despite his age and fighting class, it never stopped him from trying.." *He smiled.* "Ooo, Karol wasn't the only one practising his skills!"

--

*Luna stood on the outskirts of a forest, listening to the waves crash around Silver Wind Island.*

Luna: *She held the bow and stared at a dangling piece of paper, which hung off a large branch by a piece of string.* "OK-"

*Luna watched the paper sway in the gentle breeze, causing her to frown in concentration.*

Lezard: "I feel so old, watching over everyone, bwarharh. Well, I am old, but you get what I mean."

Luna: "Ha!" *She flicked the string to the arrow, noticing nothing happen.*

Destiny: "Yeup." *She meowed in failure, causing Luna to tighten the bow in frustration.*

Lezard: "I remember watching over Luna and being utterly puzzled with her training."

*Lezard skipped into the area Luna and Destiny were training, catching their attention.*

Lezard: "Ooo, Loonzamotto, what are you doing?"

Luna: "I'm trainin', aye." *She pulled the string back to the bow, aiming at the piece of paper.*

Lezard: "You know, you need an arrow to fire-"

Luna: "Piss off, Lizard. It's hard for me to concentrate as it is!"

Lezard: "Ouchies!" *He quickly turned around and started to run away with his arms swaying in the air.* "Everyone, be careful! Loonamotto is trying to concentrate! And it's Lezard!"

Luna: *She listened to Lezard's wails, causing her to smirk.* (Dickhead.)

Lezard: "Boy, am I the only one that thinks I'm hilarious? Bwarharh."

Destiny: *She glanced at Luna, noticing her lack of concentration.* "Yeup!"

Luna: "My bad!" *She spoke to Destiny with sincerity and flicked the string, causing the paper to suddenly sway in the breeze.* "Aye? Was that me or.. The wind?"

----------

*Lezard started to walk along the cliff, making his way to Silver Wind Island.*

Lezard: "I was also doing some hard work! Taking advantage of Dawn's research facility." *He looked up in recollection.*

--

*Lezard sat on a hi-tech looking chair and typed on a large Rosterology console, causing a plate filled with muffins to appear on a glowing glyph.*

Lezard: "Yummies!" *He grabbed the muffins with vulture-like hands and shoved them into his mouth.* "Ooo, rstard field? Sucklent."

Lezard: "Translation. Ooo, custard filled? Succulent! As I happily chewed on the succulent, tender muffins of wisdom.. Hmmm." *He rubbed his belly in excitement.*

Lezard: *He burped and finished off the plate.* "Phew.. Mission completed! That's another quest completed for The Rostical Guild."

Lezard: "Despite my achievements, I also wondered what happened to our chunky friend?"

--

*Twortz danced on multiple glowing glyphs and sung with an echoing voice.*

Twortz: "Taking advantage of the solitude in The Ruins of Estel-" *She swayed to the side and dropped her arm, causing a distant house to explode.* "Hahahackee!"

*Twortz waved her hands up while continuing her dancing-like movement, causing glyphs to spiral in the air.*

Twortz: "My power is growing every day!-"

Lezard: "Oh but who cares about her anyway? Razzypoo was also working out-"

--

*Rachael wore workout clothes as she made sturdy movements inside a gym-like area.*

Rachael: "Hah!" *She punched the air several times before following up with a roundhouse kick.*

Lezard: "Isn't she amazing? Delightful to the eyes, yet, hurtful to your body!"

Rachael: "Hah!" *She punched the ground, causing a rock pillar to shoot up, causing her to look surprised.*

Trevour: "Heh heh, nice work, boss!"

Rachael: *She leant up and wiped sweat from her forehead, as if she's done hours worth of exercise.*

Trevour: "When you move in a powerful fashion and hit the ground with all your might, the force of your movements shows in the sturdiness of the rock."

Rachael: *She placed her hands on the rock pillar.* "Wow."

Lezard: "Not sure if this is a ground user thing, but I don't get any of what that means."

Trevour: "I think you've mastered the basics of ground."

Rachael: "Could you teach me some strong techniques?"

Trevour: "Unfortunately, I can't, boss."

Rachael: "Why?"

Trevour: "I can only use dirt or sand.."

Rachael: "Well, how about some dirt or sand techniques?"

Trevour: *He looked surprised.* "You.. Want to learn?"

Rachael: "Of course."

Trevour: "It's possible to learn Dust Storm, but it's much much much harder to master than solid rock."

Rachael: "I wouldn't have it any other way." *She smirked in determination.*

----------

Lezard: "Well, almost half a year has gone by."

--

*Twortz played the violin while rocking to each side, watching thick visible strings of sound sway across the courtyard.*

Twortz: "I think I'm making excellent progress, especially since I don't have a trainer to help me out."

Lezard: "I thought I said I didn't care about her?"

Twortz: "Now to practise this.. Ougi."

--

*Karol who wore different garments continued to dance in a more skilful manner, smiling at his own progress.*

Lezard: "More than a year has passed now.. Our little hero has grown quite a lot, he's even needed new clothes! And golly, if we didn't have Grey's help, I don't know how we could've purchased such an expensive suit."

Karol: "No matter how much I try, I can't seem to use offensive dances yet!" *He whispered to himself in frustration and tapped his foot, causing a massive green glyph to spiral around him.*

Lezard: "Umm, what's next?"

----------

*Lezard looked down, observing the waves below.*

Lezard: "We celebrated everyone's birthday! To me, it was an excuse to have some delicious beverages, bwarharh, shhh, don't tell anyone!"

*Lezard straightened his arms to keep himself balanced from falling off the cliff.*

Lezard: "Nathan wasn't necessarily doing hands-on training, but he went out with Ordin a few times to observe his fighting skills."

--

Ordin: *He slid back and held his sword with both hands, staring in front with a confident smirk.* "Foul creature!"

Nathan: "You're up against a yellow-eyed Guardian by yourself! Are you sure you don't want my help?!"

Ordin: *He smirked and raised the sword.* "Ougi."

Nathan: (His Ougi!) *He shouted in thought and leant forward, bracing himself for whatever Ordin was going to do.*

Ordin: "Rising Valor." *His sword shined like a lighthouse, blinding everything around him.*

----------

Lezard: "Well, as much as I like the fellow, Nathan's a little boring to me, so no need to think about that."

*Lezard giggled and continued to watch the waves crash at the bottom of the cliff.*

Lezard: "A good thing about having two people of the same elemental affinity, is that, as Trevour was helping Razzypoo out, he was unintentionally training himself!"

--

Trevour: "DUST STORM" *He punched upwards, causing a swirl of powerful sand to spiral in the gym.*

Rachael: "Dust Storm." *She punched upwards, causing nothing to happen.*

Trevour: *He gently swayed his hand down, causing the sand to spiral back into the ground.* "With generating sand or dirt, you need to shift your concentration from Neurons to Astragons."

Rachael: "But every move I use requires heaps of Neurons."

Trevour: "That's also why some people can't manipulate liquids."

Rachael: "This is so hard." *She grumbled to herself and frowned.* "Dust Storm."

Lezard: "I could see all this being played as a fitness campaign? Or an advertisement? So heart warming! Back to my serious training!"

--

*Lezard growled like an animal stuffing his face in a white cheesecake with strawberries on top.*

Lezard: "Attack of the mouth Guardian!" *He leant back and opened his mouth, suddenly falling face-first into the cake.*

Lezard: "Needless to say, I completed that mission too!"

Lezard: "Nothing could defeat the almighty power of the mouth Guardian!" *He giggled, elegantly tapping a napkin off his cream covered face.*

Lezard: "More than a year and a half has gone past at this point. I remember vividly, it was a scary cake!"

--

*Luna aimed the bow at the hanging piece of paper, flicking her long hair which dangled near her shoulder blades.*

Luna: "Hah!" *She flicked the string to the bow and the paper suddenly exploded into raining debris.*

Lezard: "Ooo, she did it! I knew she could!" *He giggled.*

Destiny: "Yeup!" *She hopped off Luna's shoulder and jumped up above the branch.*

Luna: *She unintentionally swayed to each side, as she saw through Destiny's eyes.* "...-"

Destiny: *She stared at rows of papers tied to the branch.* "Yeu-" *She hopped forward and cut the closest string with her cat-like claws, causing another piece of paper to flick off the branch.*

Luna: *She watched the paper dangle from a string, queuing Destiny to fall off the branch and onto her shoulder.* "I've got the technique down, but I can't remember wat I said.."

Lezard: "I think she's referring to the mud Guardian. Ooo, that's how we all bonded so easily. If you want to become friends with someone, fight a dirty big ol' mud monster!"

Luna: "Again!" *She squinted her eyes and pulled the string back.*

Lezard: "Well, around this time, Trevmeister and myself were out on a mission together and, guess what?"

--

Lezard: *He took a deep breath and leant forward in exhaustion.* "I can't."

Trevour: *He took deep breaths, standing in front of Lezard with his back facing him.* "It's all the food you've been eating-"

Lezard: "Lies!"

Trevour: *He watched a lion-like Scoldrant prowl towards him.* "Back away!"

Lezard: (I'm too weak to even heal Trevour-)

Trevour: *He shouted with an echoing voice and dropped to one knee.* "DUST STORM"

*A ring of sand splashed like water and grew in speed, suddenly erupting up underneath the Scoldrant.*

Lezard: *He looked up in shock, watching a house sized swirl of sand throw the Scoldrant into the air.* "Trevmeister?!"

Trevour: *He looked up, surprised at his own power.* "W-Wow?"

----------

Lezard: "That vigorous training with Rachael certainly helped one of our heroes out!"

*Lezard sighed with a smile and faced the entrance to Silver Wind Island, causing an aura made path to appear.*

Lezard: "Well, after all that.. It's been two years since we created our delicious guild."

*Lezard hobbled across the path and formed a fist in determination.*

Lezard: "Everyone agreed we needed to practise before heading out into the real world. What that means, I'll never know. But I understood the logic behind it."

*Lezard watched the Silver Triplets swirl around the island, revealing a door sized opening.*

Lezard: "But, I look forward to what the future holds and what's in store for our guild."

----------

*A ray of light blasted down from the sky, causing aurora coloured lights to ripple across the clouds.*

?????: *A man moaned inside the fading aurora coloured lights and slowly opened his eyes, finding himself in an open field.* "Where-?"

*A leopard-like growl snarled from behind the man, causing him to quickly stand up in shock.*

?????: "W-W-Who's there?!" *He squealed and stepped back, scratching one of the many pimples on his face.*

*The man slowly turned around, as if he was petrified what made the sounds.*

?????: "I-If this is a j-joke, I'll c-call the-" *He turned around and stuttered with a dropping jaw.* "W-What.. I-Is that?!"

*A leopard-like Scoldrant which was three times larger than the man stood in front of him, wagging its tail as if it was ready to attack.*

?????: "Okay.. Tyler.. Do you do drugs?" *He spoke in a calm relaxed manner, as if his brain was trying to rationalise the situation.* "Or am I dream-?"

Scoldrant: "Gernorroarl!" *It roared in Tyler's face, causing a few strings of saliva to flick him on the face.*

Tyler: "A-Ah?" *He looked down in terror, watching his pants darken around his crotch region.* "F-F-Fuck!-"

Scoldrant: *It opened its jaw, revealing a perfectly white set of razor sharp teeth.* "Gnoarl!-"

Tyler: "F-F-Fuck!-" *He squealed in disbelief, ignoring the growing patch in his pants.*

?????: "Lightning pulse like veins, true power recharge and discharge and flow through the easiest current, LIGHTNING STRIKE"

*A thick stream of lightning fell from the sky and struck through the Scoldrant's head, burning into the ground.*

Tyler: "A-A-A-Ah!" *He uncontrollably shook in terror, falling onto his back.* "Fuck!-"

?????: "Who goes there?"

Tyler: "Far-Far-Far-Fuck!"

?????: "Greetings, Fuck."

Tyler: "W-Who-?" *He looked to each side, overwhelmed with emotions.* "Ashton?! Twortz?! Rachael?! Melinda...?! Lance?!"

?????: *He hobbled up to Tyler and looked down, noticing the darkened area around his crotch.* (Has this gentleman urinated on himself?)

Tyler: "W-Where?!"

?????: "This is-"

Tyler: "Where is the store?!"

?????: "Store? What are you-?"

Tyler: "Th-That thing-" *He watched the Scoldrant collapse on the ground in disbelief.* "Pl-Please, don't hurt me!"

?????: "Hohoho, I just saved you. Why would I want to hurt you?"

Tyler: "..." *He continued to twitch in terror, glancing to each side in a paranoid-like manner.*

?????: "My name is Season-"

*Several more leopard-like growls snarled in the distance, catching Season's attention.*

Season: "Please, come with me to my city."

Tyler: "W-Why should I go with you?" *He squealed in terror.*

Season: "It's much safer in there." *He spoke with a smile, while purposely looking at the defeated Scoldrant.*

Tyler: *He hesitantly stood up, unsure if he could trust Season or not.* "Umm.."

Season: "Let's go. I have a few questions to ask myself!"

Tyler: "W-W-What...?"

Season: "For instance, what is with those strange clothes you wear?"

Tyler: "S-Strange clothes?"

Season: "And, your way of talking is slightly different too." *He gently placed his hand on Tyler's back, prompting him to start walking.*

Tyler: "W-Where am I?" *He sniffed, nervously scratching an oily pimple on his cheek.*

Season: (Herm..) *He rubbed his chin in thought, as he made his way to an enormous grey sphere.* (He appears to be in a state of shock? I understand Scoldrant attacks can be frightening, but to act like this?)

Tyler: "I-I want to go home-" *He stepped on tiny white pebbles and scratched another pimple on his face, causing it to bleed.*

Season: "Well, where are you from?" *He stopped at the grey wall.*

Tyler: *He sniffed and wiped under his eyes, staring at the wall in confusion.* "What are you-?"

Season: "Since you're in shock-" *He gently held Tyler's arm and stepped through the grey wall, causing it to ripple like water.*

Tyler: "A-Ah-?!" *He squealed in terror and kept his eyes closed.* "It's solid rock!-"

Season: "Excuse me?"

Tyler: "You're crazy-" *He heard people chatter, causing him to open his eyes.* "Huh? Where-?"

*Tyler gasped in shock and spun around, noticing he stood in a massive city in confusion.*

Tyler: "Where are we?"

Season: "Hohoho. This is Surpreon!"

Tyler: "Surpreon?"

Chapter 13: Song Versus Summoner

*Trevour and Rachael had a few drinks at the tavern, talking to each other with smiles.*

Rachael: "I can't believe it's been two years."

Trevour: "I know, boss!"

Rachael: "Do you think it's time we go for our first S classed mission?"

Trevour: "I certainly hope so. We trained non-stop for this moment."

Rachael: "Well-"

*Karol, Lezard, Nathan and Luna walked into the tavern, catching Rachael's attention.*

Rachael: "Hey!"

Lezard: "Ooo, hello you two little monsters."

Rachael: "Hehe. How was the mission?"

Lezard: "Well, Karol's supportive skills, Nathan's amazing sword skills and Luna's long range attacks, I didn't even have to heal."

Trevour: "You didn't? Not even once?"

Luna: "Nope." *She smirked and sat down on the bench, clicking her fingers above her head.* "Some rum please!"

Keeper: "The usual!" *She smiled at Luna and started to pour some drinks.*

Karol: *He hopped onto the bench and sighed with a satisfying smile.* "Awesome work, everyone."

Lezard: "Everyone has grown up so much! I remember our little hero couldn't even get on these benches without help."

Karol: "Th-That's because I'ma man now!"

Nathan: "Hmph, no you're not." *He spoke in a deep voice, smiling at Karol.*

Luna: "It has been two somethin' years, aye."

Rachael: (We're seriously like family.) *She smiled to herself in thought.*

Luna: "I still think Trevour is a pushover."

Trevour: "Madam?"

Rachael: "Luna?" *She sounded annoyed.*

Nathan: "Let her talk, it's constructive feedback."

Luna: "Yea. I'm just tellin' ya-" *She sniffed and looked away.* "'Cause I've somehow grown to like havin' you around."

Trevour: *He smiled and looked down, swirling the brown liquid in his cup.* "I know."

Nathan: "You already know?"

Trevour: "Indeed, sir."

Luna: "If you know you're a pushover, then.."

Nathan and Luna: "Why?"

Trevour: "My biggest mistake, is that I take people on at face value.. I trust people too easily.. It's a weakness I know I have, and I can't change it.. It's a part of who I am."

Rachael: (He's like Ashton in a way-)

Luna: "You're such a twat."

Trevour: "M-Madam?" *He sounded surprised.*

Luna: "Then you'd get walked all over, aye."

Destiny: "Yeup." *She purred in agreement.*

Rachael: "I have to agree with Luna."

Trevour: "You think so too, boss?"

Lezard: "Ooo, plot twist." *He sarcastically spoke in excitement, wiggling his bottom on the bench.*

Rachael: "Although he never agreed with me, I watched people use and abuse Ashton's kindness." *She looked down and quickly took a shot of her drink.*

Trevour: "Don't misunderstand me."

Nathan: "Hmm?" *He grunted and watched the barkeeper place cups across the table, causing him to start drinking.*

Keeper: "And a non-alcohol beverage for the guild's leader." *She smiled at Karol before walking away.*

Karol: "But I didn't order-?"

Keeper: "On the house."

Karol: "Nee hee, fanks!"

Trevour: *He looked at Nathan.* "Don't take advantage of my kindness, it won't always be there."

Luna: "So, you're not nice some times? Like, you get your period?"

Trevour: "Err.."

Luna: "Aha, I'm just messin', aye."

Trevour: "Heh heh." *He shook his head with a smile.* (Strange-)

Nathan: "I've seen you act quite harshly to some people."

Trevour: *He nodded his head.* "Despite taking people for face value, I'm able to understand the signs of a bad person."

Lezard: "Ooo, this is getting deep."

Karol: "Slurp.." *He happily drunk his drink from a straw, as if he wasn't really paying attention to the conversation.*

Trevour: (Alan.. Felipe.. Rosemary..) *He frowned in recollection.*

----------

*Alan, Felipe and Rosemary stood in a line inside a room completely made of stone, staring at Trevour who sat on the edge of a bed.*

Trevour: "What is it now, brother?"

Alan: "You need to start practising solid rock."

Trevour: "But.. I can't."

Rosemary: "We've almost peaked the secondary level of our elemental affinity-"

Alan: "How many times do we need to tell you?"

Rosemary: "In honour of our parents!"

Trevour: ".. I can become strong.. Practice what I've already got-"

Felipe: *He shook his head.* "If you always aim for what you've already accomplished, then you will always achieve what you've already got."

Trevour: "H-Huh?" *He looked up with widening eyes, as if Felipe's words triggered a train of thought.*

Felipe: "Let's go, Alan, Rosemary." *He turned around and moved his foot to the side, causing the stone door to roll open.*

Alan: "Get a grip, Trevour. You can never be as strong as us with your damned sand."

Rosemary: "As much as I love you, Trevour-" *She looked over her shoulder, staring at Trevour.* "You need to stop playing in the sandbox."

Trevour: "Rosemary-"

Rosemary: "..." *She silently walked out of the room and swayed her arm to the side, causing the door to roll back.*

Trevour: "..."

----------

Trevour: *He looked up, glancing at each guild member.* "I've been told by my siblings.. If you always aim for what you've already accomplished, then you will always achieve what you've already got."

Rachael: "Hey, that's a pretty cool quote."

Trevour: "It was meant for something else, but I took it for that."

Nathan: *He smiled in respect and took a sip from his drink, causing him to pull a sour face of satisfaction.* "You aren't bad, Trevour."

Trevour: "Thank you, sir."

Rachael: "You mentioned you have siblings, brother or sister?"

Trevour: "I have two brothers and one sister."

Lezard: "Wow, I know what your parents were doing."

Luna: "Must've not had electricity aye? Aha."

Rachael: "Hehe."

Trevour: "What about you?"

Rachael: "I'm an only child."

Trevour: *He glanced at Luna.* "And you, madam?"

Luna: "Retarded brother."

Lezard: "I'm also an only child."

Nathan: "Same." *He spoke in a deep voice, leaning back in a manly manner.*

Karol: "I've got my two cousins. They're twins."

Trevour: "Well, now we know." *He spoke with a smile.*

Lezard: "Enough seriousness, little monsters-" *He raised his glass to the middle of the table.* "To us-"

Trevour and Rachael: "The Rostical Guild!-"
Luna: "The Guild of Epic People-"
Nathan: "The Mighty Guild."
Karol: "The Remenistal Guild."
Lezard: "The Flavoursome Heroes!"

*The guild spoke at the same time and clicked all their glasses together.*

Luna: "Aha, fail!"

Rachael: "Hehe-"

*A man ran into the tavern, purposely catching everyone's attention.*

----------

*Twortz walked down a stone corridor and noticed several warriors clustering at the entrance to a large dirt pit outside.*

Twortz: "What is happening?"

*A warrior with the number one hundred and thirty-one faced Twortz.*

Warrior: "It's a very rare meeting with the Consultant and all our captains."

Twortz: "All our captains?" *She stepped forward, slightly nervous and excited.* (I can't see from here if PKMY is there-)

*Twortz started to walk forward, causing several of the warriors to gasp in shock.*

Warrior: "You can't go out there!"

Twortz: *She paused and looked over her shoulder, staring at the warriors in confusion.* ".. Why?"

Warrior: "It's forbidden! You could even get killed for such disrespect!"

Twortz: "I see."

*Twortz proudly walked into the massive arena-like dirt pit and stared at the line of captain classed warriors, catching several of their attention.*

Kath: *She glanced over the captain's shoulders and stepped forward, glaring at Twortz.* "This is a captain classed meeting. If you wish to discuss anything, you are to wait in Sorrowprax, regardless of its importance!"

Twortz: "Actually-" *She stopped behind the line of warriors and looked at Kath, placing her hands behind her back.* "I am here to become a captain."

*Several of the captains snickered, causing Kath to raise her arm which caused them to become silent.*

Kath: "You poor girl, thinking you-" *She paused in disbelief.* "What is your ranking?" *She spoke on her breath.*

Twortz: "I'm currently ranked two hundred and twenty."

Kath: *She chuckled in an evil-like manner.* "How unfathomable."

Twortz: *She quickly bowed down to one knee, lowering her head.* "I will give you all my respect. I will do as you ask. I will be your most loyal captain."

Kath: "Hmph. I like the drive, but, you are far too weak."

Twortz: "Weak?"

Kath: "There is a reason why the rankings are-"

Twortz: *She waved her hand and blasted one of the captains off her feet, causing several gasps to be heard.* "I can reassure you, lady Consultant, that I am not weak."

?????: *A man stepped forward and stared at Twortz.* "To attack a captain is foolish. But to attack a captain in the presence of the number one, suicide."

Kath: "Cameron, that is all."

Cameron: *He glanced at Kath, nodding his head in respect.* "As you desire, ma'am." *He spoke with an emotionless face and stood back in line.*

Twortz: (So that man is the number one?)

?????: "Grrr!" *The captain Twortz knocked off her feet growled in rage.* "Ma'am. With your permission, can I feed this peasant to the Scoldrants!?"

Twortz: "Hahackee.." *She chuckled in a condescending-like manner.*

Kath: "Very well." *She clapped her hands and pushed her glasses up with one finger.* "Nancy, do as you will."

Nancy: "Bwohohoho. You're dead-"

Cameron: "With respect, we are in the middle of an important meeting-"

Kath: "Everyone, watch from the higher level balconies." *She nudged her head upwards and suddenly flashstepped, causing a pulse of dirt to blow where she stood.*

Cameron: "Tcch."

*A woman with long blonde hair glanced at Cameron in confusion.*

Woman: "Captain?"

Cameron: "Despite my ranking, Cindy. She is the Consultant-"

Cindy: "Yes. Sisters, let's go!-" *She suddenly flashstepped, causing two other women to disappear out of the dirt pit.*

*A woman with silver hair licked her lips in excitement, revealing slightly sharp teeth.*

?????: "How exciting-"

Twortz: *She glanced at the silver-haired woman in confusion.* "..."

?????: "Nancy is a boss out of your league, hahehahe." *She flicked her ponytail over her shoulder and suddenly disappeared, causing a swirl of dirt to pulse where she stood.*

Nancy: *She watched all the captains flashstep, leaving only her and Twortz.* "Bwohoho. Let's have some fun, you dirty lamp."

Twortz: "Such language while on the job is completely unprofessional."

Nancy: "You ready to die?"

Twortz: *She smiled.* "I'd like to see you try-"

Nancy: *She suddenly appeared behind Twortz in the air, swaying her leg for a sweeping kick.* "Hah!"

Twortz: *She quickly spun around and leant back in a dancer-like fashion, avoiding the kick.* "Hahackee-"

Nancy: "Hah!" *She landed on the ground and punched the dirt, causing a massive tower sized brown snake to slither into the air.*

Twortz: *She looked up in shock, as the snake's shadow caused the temperature to drop around her.* "Sonic Rush."

*Twortz swayed her hand to the side and blew a scattered shock wave at the serpent, causing her to slide back.*

Twortz: *She watched the serpent hiss, as chunks of its underbelly fell off its body.* (Hahackee! Despite its size, it was rather weak-)

Nancy: *She smirked evil-like and sprinted through the disintegrating snake.* (There's nothing she can do to keep herself alive!)

Cameron: *He looked to his side, noticing a woman with pink, blue and blonde hair talking amongst themselves.* "What is the fuss, Mindy, Cindy and Wendy?"

Cindy: *She swayed her long yellow hair, glancing at the arena.* "Why did she get rid of that amazing summon?"

Wendy: *She twirled her finger through her pink hair.* "I would've totally kept it ongoing."

Mindy: *She nodded her head.* "Yeah!"

Cameron: *He stared at Mindy's short green hair.* "She has the ability to use one time only summons."

Wendy: "That's stupid-"

Cameron: "Negative. It uses one-fifth of the Neuron usage usually used to perform a summon. It is how she became number two of the captains."

Cindy: "So-"

?????: *She glared at the sisters with her cold silver eyes.* "How about you watch the match that's already out of your league, and perhaps you could actually learn something? We all know you won't ever make it past the sixth ranking."

Cindy: *She formed fists, as if she wanted to fight.* "Yes, Sofia."

Sofia: "Haheahe."

Nancy: *She flashstepped in front of Twortz, raising her arm.* "I summon thee, LIGHTNING STRIKE"

Twortz: *She looked up with a gasp.* "Sacred dance, Sphere of Might." *She tapped her foot on the ground, causing an expanding sphere to blast around her.*

*Lightning suddenly struck down from the sky and hit the sound barrier, amplifying the lightning's thunder.*

Cindy: "L-Loud-"

Twortz: (She's strong!) *She watched the lightning string around the sound sphere, before bursting away.* (But when was the last time she trained her skills?)

Nancy: *She flashstepped by Twortz's side and suddenly kicked towards her face.* "Bwoho-"

Twortz: "Sacred dance, Defence Up." *She curled her knuckles back and placed her arms together in front of her without even facing Nancy.*

Nancy: *She kicked the side of Twortz's face and watched dirt spiral past her head.* "Huh?"

Twortz: "Done?"

Nancy: (Her face feels like stone?!) *She back flipped away from Twortz.*

Twortz: *She spun around and raised her arms, facing Nancy.* "I noticed this Azure Burst acts differently when I don't have my weapon released-"

Nancy: (Those Neurons!-) *She frowned and suddenly held a blue pearl in her hand.* "Go!"

*A splash of water shot out of the ground behind Nancy, as a silver dolphin-like Scoldrant dived in and out of the sand, as if it was water.*

Twortz: "Sacred dance, Lymph's Wave." *She lowered both her arms and an invisible wave crashed down on top of Nancy, forcing her onto her knees.*

Nancy: "What?!" *She watched the sand continuously blow away from her.* "I can't move-"

Twortz: "I've spent the last two years training to kill a captain.. You're nothing but just an obstacle."

Nancy: "Silence!"

Twortz: "Telling a Score User to be quiet? Hahahackeeee!"

*Twortz laughed with a loud echo and spun around, generating visible sound strings.*

Twortz: "Everybody makes these mistakes!" *She continued to spin around in a dancer-like manner.*

Cindy: "What is she doing?" *She looked at Twortz in confusion.*

Sofia: "Generating Astragons.. Isn't it obvious to you? Hahehahe."

Twortz: "Sealed scores, Silencing Blast." *She froze her entire body movement and the swirling strings suddenly rippled towards Nancy.*

Nancy: "You think two years can compete with my forty years as a warrior?!"

*A large stone golem suddenly materialised in front of Nancy and withstood the swirling strings, before exploding into nothing.*

Nancy: (Making me use my defensive wall already-) *She stood up and flicked her long brown hair which was wrapped in a ponytail over her back.*

Twortz: *She spun around and waved her arm, blowing a scattered shock wave behind her.* "Sonic Rush." *She shouted with an echoing voice and watched the silver dolphin-like Scoldrant dive up into the shock wave.*

Nancy: *She listened to the dolphin's squeaks, as it exploded into nothing.* (She knew where Fin-Fin was going to strike-?!)

Twortz: "Sacred scores-" *She formed a triangle with her fingers and took a deep breath, waiting for Nancy to move out of the dirt cloud.*

Nancy: *She suddenly flashstepped away from the dirt cloud and held a green pearl.* "Binding Vines."

Twortz: "Sonic Pulsar." *She breathed into her fingers, blasting a vortex of sound towards Nancy.*

*Thick green vines suddenly shot out of a Spacial Funnel behind Nancy and exploded yellow wax, as the vortex of sound hit it.*

Kath: "What did she say her ranking was?" *She smiled in an impressed-like manner, observing Twortz's battle movements.*

Cameron: "Two hundred and twenty, ma'am."

Kath: "Do you sense anything strange, Zephyr?"

Zephyr: *He looked at Twortz and focused, causing his visual perspective to change, allowing him to see aura-like energy swirl within her body.* "N-No, ma'am."

Kath: (So she's not corrupt, like Zayden.) *She glanced at a man who intensely stared at Nancy and Twortz, as drool oozed out from the side of his mouth.* (Excellent.)

Nancy: *She watched the Spacial Funnel behind her warp before distorting into nothing.* (Where did the Spacial Funnel go-?!)

Twortz: "The look on your face." *She smirked.* "I've learnt how to change the harmonic frequency to any of my attacks. I've simply cancelled your Spacial Funnel."

Nancy: (She cancelled the Spacial Funnel through harmonic frequencies? Is that possible?)

Twortz: "Rather unprofessional for someone who's worked more than, what was that? Forty years? To not know-"

Nancy: "Arthur, dinner is ready." *She glared at Twortz in anger, ignoring a large blue orb which materialised in her hand.*

Cameron: (This is one of her actual Summonce Scarbras-)

Twortz: (That snake from before!-) *She frowned in recollection.*

Nancy: "Use your Remenistal!"

*A large green snake suddenly materialised around Nancy and leant up, glaring at Twortz.*

Arthur: "HYDRO CANNONs-" *It opened its jaw and hissed, blasting out a cannon of water at Twortz.*

Nancy: "Bwohohoho."

Zayden: *He leant forward with a widening smile.* "Look at the volume of water! Bwahrargh!"

Twortz: *She took a deep breath and screamed.* "Sonic Roar."

*The cannon of water exploded before coming into contact with Twortz, causing her echoing scream to gargle.*

Nancy: (She seems to have a counter to a lot of different techniques!-) *She raised both arms and reached over her head, smirking with anticipation.*

Cameron: (She's going to release her weapon.)

Nancy: "Let's see if you have a counter to this!" *She pulled both arms forward, watching a swirl of sparks scatter from a blue sceptre shaped as a lightning bolt in her hands.*

Sofia: "Ooo, her level just increased?"

Kath: "Silence. You are the role models, the leaders of this entire organisation. You all should be able to gather and answer your questions from watching this fight alone!"

Twortz: (A sceptre? Is she a Rostical User-?)

Nancy: "Bwohohoho." *She looked behind Twortz and watched a swirl in the air suddenly blast a hurricane towards her.*

Twortz: *She looked over her shoulder, hiding her surprise.* (What is that-?!) *The fat in her face suddenly rolled back, as if she was skydiving.*

Nancy: *She smirked, watching Twortz slide back with an obvious struggle.* "Bwohoho! Arthur, you know what to do."

*A cannon of water suddenly blasted Twortz in the back, crashing her along the ground.*

Twortz: *She squealed in pain, as the high pressured gust of wind blew around the water, suddenly amplifying its power.* (Tsst-)

Kath: "This fight is over.." *She spoke with disappointment.*

Sofia: "Tssk tssk tssk. Challenging the number two-" *She turned around, as if she was bored with the battle.*

Nancy: *She swirled the lightning shaped sceptre, watching violent swirls of water and wind blow around Twortz.* (I've got her in an inescapable rip.. She'll be dead soon enough-)

Twortz: *She tumbled in a powerful current which was boosted by the unusual winds.* "Everybody makes these mistakes! Sealed scores-"

*Twortz sung on her breath to avoid any water going into her mouth, continuing to tumble in Nancy's rip.*

Twortz: (Don't ever laugh at me!-) *She violently grabbed her hands into the ground, causing the swirling movement around her to burst the water away.*

Sofia: "Game over, hahehahehahe-"

Twortz: "Silencing Blast."

Cameron: (Silencing Blast, that was the same Azure Burst she used to gather Astragons via a swirling motion.. She used her disadvantage to gain the upper hand-)

Nancy: "How have you not drowned?"

Twortz: *She took deep breaths and slowly stood up, dripping with water.* "I'm a warrior by spirit!" *She kicked the ground, causing all the water to pulse off her body.*

Nancy: "Fine! Ougi." *She crossed her arms, causing a massive aurora coloured pearl to materialise in front of her.*

Twortz: (Her Ougi.) *She bent her knees, mentally bracing herself for the unknown.*

Mindy: (A number two Ougi!) *She trembled in thought, as if she was excited to see it.*

Kath: (One of the few captains that can control the weather.)

Nancy: "Harrrrh!" *She screamed and jabbed the sceptre into the pearl, causing lightning to vein across the sky.*

Twortz: *She looked up, hiding her astonishment.* (Lightning?!)

Arthur: *He slithered towards Twortz at incredible skills.* "HYDRO CANNON"

Twortz: *She gasped and looked to the side, watching Arthur's eyes glare.* "Fast-"

*Twortz quickly hobbled to the side and awkwardly swirled to the side, as the water shot past her shoulder.*

Twortz: *She looked at her armour, noticing it was bent out of shape.* (Its stream has increased in power-?)

Arthur: "Hsssst."

Twortz: "Sacred scores, Sonic Pulsar." *She formed a triangle with her fingers and breathed through it, blasting a vortex of sound at Arthur.*

Nancy: *She focused her attention in the sky, watching rain clouds quickly cover the battlefield.* "Harh!" *She swayed both arms downwards, causing a blast of water to crash on top of Twortz.*

Twortz: (Argh!-) *She gritted her teeth, as the water pushed her onto the ground.*

*Yellow, red and blue glyphic rings spiralled around the cracking pearl, queuing her to raise her arms.*

Nancy: "I summon the maelstrom of death! Poly Zap."

*Thunder rumbled and it started to rain, causing all the captains to look up.*

Kath: (The passive damage of her Ougi is devastating in drawn out battles.)

Wendy: *She watched the dirt around Twortz darken, as the waterfall-like stream of water continued to pour on top of Twortz.* (She's completely immobilised..)

Twortz: (This isn't how I planned-... This isn't a part of the plan!) *She thought with squinted eyes due to the water's pressure.*

Nancy: (This one is persistent.) *She frowned with anticipation.*

Twortz: (This isn't apart of my plan! Sonic Roar.) *She screamed out an echoing shock wave, blasting herself out of the tunnel of water.*

Nancy: "Brrh!" *She growled in anger.* "Arthur, eat her!"

Arthur: "HYDRO CANNON"

Twortz: *She leant up, standing on her knees, taking deep breaths.* "I can't-"

*A tunnel of water hit Twortz and blasted her off her feet across the ground.*

Cameron: *He watched the distance between Arthur and Twortz.* (That is one powerful Remenistal Using Scoldrant.)

Sofia: "Yarh? The fat one keeps getting hurt, this is no longer fun to watch.."

Kath: "Stop wasting our time, number two. Finish her quickly."

Nancy: "Yes, ma'am!"

Twortz: *She tumbled on her side and coughed out water, as if it was a struggle to move.* (I can't die here.. After all I've done-)

Nancy: "Harh!" *She swayed her sceptre down, causing a lightning bolt to strike down from the darkening clouds, striking into Twortz's back.*

Twortz: "Arghckee!" *She screamed in pain.*

Nancy: (Finish her off.)

Arthur: *He slithered towards Twortz and watched her twitch in pain.* "Tssskt." *He quickly struck Twortz and blinding speeds and swallowed her whole.*

Nancy: "Bwohohoh."

Wendy: "Whoa! Swallowed whole!"

Zayden: "Bwarhagh!" *He chuckled like a maniac, as if he was excited by the way the fight ended.*

Twortz: *She sunk in gel-like water, listening to a heart beat.* (Is this the end? All my training.. My revenge, my drive.. Everything all for nothing?)

Nancy: "What a fat disrespectful dirty lamp." *She looked up and spread her arms, enjoying the rain.*

Twortz: (What a fat disrespectful dirty lamp?) *She thought to herself in misery.* (No! Why the hell am I giving up?! I haven't even gone all out! If I'm going to give, then I'll take this woman with me!)

Nancy: "Alright, everyone. Let's continue the discussion."

Mindy: "Sweet-" *She readied to jump down.*

Cameron: "Halt. I sense a Neuron build up."

Cindy: "So? She's been eaten-?"

*Arthur suddenly exploded from the middle body and wet dirt pulsed away, revealing Twortz covered in green slime.*

Nancy: "A-Arthur?" *She spoke in shock.*

Twortz: *She angrily wiped her face, frowning at Nancy.* "Come at me with your best! As I will."

Nancy: "Best?!" *She crossed her arms, causing two human-sized green dragons to appear on both her sides.* "Kill this bitch!"

Kath: (This woman.) *She observed Twortz with a slight smile.* (Her Astragons just shifted from defensive to offensive.)

Twortz: "Let's go, kill me!"

Nancy: *She growled with a twitching eye.* "Now!"

Twortz: (If I can manipulate the Astragons with my arms, who's to say I can't do the same with-)

*Twortz glanced to the side and watched a dragon suddenly appear by her side.*

Twortz: (I need to focus directly in its head!-) "Sonic Rush." *She swayed her arm, blowing a scattered shock wave in its face.*

Cameron: (That attack was concentrated. But why?)

*The other dragon flashstepped behind Twortz and inhaled deeply, suddenly blowing out a long red flame.*

Nancy: "It's over-"

Twortz: "Hahackee!" *She suddenly disappeared, causing a pulse of wet dirt to explode where she stood.*

Nancy: "Huh?!"

Twortz: *She suddenly appeared behind the dragon that breathed out flames and inhaled deeply.* "Sonic Roar." *She screamed out a deafening shock wave, exploding the dragon's head off.*

Mindy: "How can she flashstep? That's a captain only technique."

Sofia: "Really? It's obvious she's captain level already. This is why you're number nine, hahehahe."

Mindy: "..."

Twortz: *She reached over her shoulder and pulled forward, watching sparks swirl around her violin.* "Sacred dance, Power Up."

Nancy: (What kind of weapon is that-?)

Twortz: *She started to play the violin, causing it to echo over the heavy rain.* "Hahckee!-" *She suddenly flashstepped, blowing a swirl of wet dirt and water where she stood.*

Mindy: (It's getting darker and darker-)

Nancy: (One of my babies! The Neurons in her attack were strong enough to blow off-)

Twortz: *She suddenly appeared in front of Nancy cutting her off in mid-thought.* "Hahackee!"

*Strings of visible sound suddenly blasted Nancy's left hand off, causing gasps to be heard in the distance.*

Nancy: "Argh?! Get her!-" *She looked over Twortz's shoulder, watching the other dragon collapse onto the dirt.* "How?"

Twortz: "A shock wave in its head, fried the thing's brains, quite simple really." *She smiled, listening to the sounds of her fading violin chords.*

Nancy: "Hah!" *She waved down, striking a lightning bolt in front of Twortz.*

Twortz: *She spun around in a dancer-like manner and flashstepped away.* "So, in order to be a good.. Anything really-" *She appeared out of striking distance.* "Is to use your best techniques last."

Nancy: "Stop talking to me like that. I am number two, filthy peasant!" *She screamed in rage and waved the sceptre, causing a stroke of water to explode in a slash-like line across Twortz.*

Twortz: *She flashstepped several feet back, listening to the water's rumbling sound.* "Ougi."

Nancy: "You may have defeated my three Summonce Scarbras, but I still have the weather! You can never beat that!" *She raised the sceptre in the air, watching lightning scatter in the clouds.*

Twortz: "Words don't silence me, allow my power to be expressed through these movements you can't even comprehend-" *She sung the incantation, causing purple glyphs to materialise and spiral around her.*

Nancy: "I'll channel all my power and release a level five thunderstorm directly on top of you!"

Twortz: "Scores and dances, come forth and show the opponent your power-" *She shouted, causing aurora, petal-like flowers to erupt out of the glyphs.*

Wendy: "Wow."

Twortz: "AURORA BLOSSOM" *She readjusted the violin and placed the dagger on the strings, listening to musical-like scratches echo from the petals.*

Nancy: "Die!"

Twortz: "Hahahahahahackee!" *She tilted the violin and a stream of aurora petals splashed in front, rippling towards Nancy.*

Nancy: "Grarh!" *She nudged the sceptre forward, causing the petals to explode in a sphere-like blast of water.*

Sofia: "Now this is a fight! Hahehahe!" *She licked her lips and placed her hands on the rails, emphasising her sudden excitement.*

Nancy: *She swayed the sceptre to each side, watching natural lightning strikes, flash down around Twortz.* "Grrr!"

Twortz: *She continued to play the violin, causing streams of aurora petals to string up blocking each lightning bolt.* (Ckee! I'm giving it my all!)

Cameron: *He showed a slight sign of surprise which was out of his character.* "Impressive-"

*Flashes of aurora coloured lightning sparked around the area the two powers touched.*

Twortz: "I will not give up!" *She applied more pressure on the dagger as she played the violin, causing the streams of aurora flowers to thicken, breaking through some of Nancy's lightning bolts.*

Nancy: "Rain down! Release your fury!" *She shouted at the top of her lungs, causing the entire cloud to rain down lightning bolts around Twortz.*

Cindy: (That level of lightning... It's even out of my league!) *She mumbled in thought, as she stared at the lightning with a dropping jaw.*

Sofia: *Her face lit up due to the lightning.* "She's on her last life, you always go out with a bang when you've got no continues left."

Cameron: "Their Neuron levels.. They both have been depleted."

Nancy: *She watched the lightning dissipate, leaving behind black dirt.* "Done." *She sighed in relief, watching the ground steam from the onslaught of lightning bolts.*

Mindy: *She gasped in shock.* "When-?"

Cameron: "Hoh?"

Nancy: *She heard breathing, causing her to instinctively turn around.* "You!" *She glared at Twortz.*

Twortz: *She panted and moved the dagger across the violin, noticing it no longer played.* "Oh?" *She glanced at the violin, noticing all the strings had broken.*

Kath: "Zephyr?"

Zephyr: "Like what Cameron said-" *He watched faint flickers of aura swirl inside Twortz and Nancy.* "They're both completely out, ma'am."

Sofia: "I wonder how this will play out?"

Kath: "Hmm?" *She looked intrigued, trying to hide her smile.*

Nancy: "Why, you dirty-" *She noticed the clouds clear up, pouring sunlight into the arena.*

Twortz: *She slightly squinted her eyes due to the sunlight.* "Do you remember me?"

Nancy: "No." *She dropped the sceptre, causing her to look surprised.* (I lost feeling in my arm?)

Twortz: "I noticed your rain sapped the Neurons out of me."

Nancy: "Bwohoho, that's the secondary ability of my Ougi."

Twortz: "So yours has a second ability, too?"

Nancy: "Too? What are you talking about?!"

Twortz: *She dropped the violin and dagger, as if she couldn't hold them up any more.* "The flowers you remember seeing?"

Nancy: "Yes?" *She reached behind her back, causing the sceptre to suddenly materialise into her hand.*

Twortz: "They were not flowers, but light."

Nancy: "That makes no sense."

Twortz: "I think my unique way of learning Astragons and Neurons gave me the slight advantage-"

Nancy: "Shut up! Stop talking like you've won! I can feel your Neurons! You're just about empty!"

Twortz: "Hahackee. I know. I don't have the energy to attack you like I wanted to."

Nancy: "So?" *She struggled to keep hold of the sceptre.*

Twortz: "When you started raining your lightning on to me, I was never on the defensive." *She spread her arms with an exhausted smile.* "Small particles of light were spreading across this dirt field you have here-"

Nancy: "Make it quick!"

Twortz: "The light can manifest into what you've seen."

Wendy: "Those flowers.. Is it possible they were light?"

Cameron: "By the Astragon laws, it is possible-" (Although, very hard to fathom.)

Twortz: "One thing I noticed, is that the light, they are really sensitive to my Neurons."

Nancy: "You make no sense, how can your own ability be sensitive to your own Neurons?"

Twortz: "Think of it as a detonation perhaps?"

Nancy: *She lunged forward, readying to stab Twortz in the side of the head with the sceptre.* "Die!"

Twortz: "Negative." *She gently placed her hand on Nancy's chest and concentrated.* "Didn't anyone tell you? Not to mess with the people who make your food?"

Nancy: "Bwoho!" *She laughed and watched the sceptre about to touch the side of Twortz's head, before exploding into several pieces.*

Wendy: "Gee-?!" *She jumped in fright, watching Nancy's arm spiral in the air.*

Mindy: *She looked surprised.* "H-Huh?"

Sofia: "Haheahe. Game over." *She smirked evil-like, staring at Nancy's severed body parts which had scattered around Twortz.*

Cameron: "I see. She purposely allowed her Ougi to burst against the lightning, causing Nancy to inhale some of the light."

Kath: (Such power, intelligence, form-) *She suddenly appeared in front of Twortz with a smile.*

Twortz: *She dropped to her knees due to exhaustion.* "Am I safe to assume you're the Consultant?"

Kath: "Indeed I am." *She pushed her glasses up with one finger.*

Twortz: "I am sorry and happy for you at the same time."

Kath: "Explain."

Twortz: "I'm sorry you lost your captain, but I'm happy you gained a better one."

Kath: *She chuckled with a widening smile, thinning out her lips.* "What is your name?"

Twortz: "Twortz Montana, your loyal captain starting from this day out."

Kath: *She touched her glasses and hid her smile.* "What makes you think you're a captain?"

Twortz: "That's entirely up to you."

Kath: *She turned around, watching eight captains flashstep in a line in front of her.* "Captains!"

Captains: "Ma'am!" *They spoke at the same time in a military-like fashion.*

Kath: "I'd like to welcome Twortz to the team!"

Twortz: (Just as I planned.) *She smiled to herself and glanced at the captains.* "Where's PKMY?! She's not here?!" *She whispered to herself in disbelief.*

Kath: "Number four."

Sofia: *She stood up straight.* "Ma'am."

Kath: "Go help our new number two clean herself up."

Sofia: "Of course." *She smirked evil-like and stepped forward, flashstepping beside Twortz.*

Twortz: "Who-?"

Sofia: "Shh." *She grabbed Twortz and flashstepped.*

----------

Keeper: *She glanced across the tavern, looking at the man in confusion.* "What's the problem?"

Man: *He stood by the tavern's door, taking quick, excited breaths.* "One of the top four guilds have made it back from their S classed mission."

Keeper: *She stopped cleaning a cup and looked at the man intrigued.* "Who? I'm not expecting one of the top four to be here now?"

Man: "The Seraphic Sunders."

Keeper: (Skyward and Hayward-?)

Skyward: *He staggered into the tavern, covered in blood.* "I-It's strong!"

Rachael: "Whoa-" *She hopped off the bench and ran up to Skyward.* "What happened?"

Hayward: *She walked into the tavern, holding her blood covered arm.* "We were fighting an Astragon Projection."

Rachael: "An Astragon Projection?"

Lezard: *He bent down and spread his arms over Skyward, causing his wounds to slowly heal.* "Don't worry, I'll tell you later."

Rachael: "Thanks."

Keeper: "You two never had this trouble before? Did you let go of each other's hands?"

Hayward: "No.. He knew Moonlight Reflection-"

Skyward: "And he seemed to have no restrictions using it."

Nathan: "What was the mission?"

Hayward: "To eliminate the Astragon Projection that continues to haunt passing travellers near The Elemental Tower."

Nathan: "Well-" *He stood up with an excited smile, causing the guild to slowly follow him.* "Everyone thinking what I'm thinking?"

Lezard: "Muffins with cranberry sauce?"

Luna: "Let's kick this Astragong Projector." *She smirked with a confident frown.*

Trevour: "Astragon Projection, madam-"

Luna: "Wateva."

Destiny: "Yeup."

Lezard: (Done.) *He stood up, causing Skyward to look shocked.*

Skyward: (H-Healed?!)

Rachael: "Alright!"

Karol: "Don't worry, evewyone! The Rostical Guild has got this!" *He announced to everyone in the tavern, causing the different guilds to look at him.*

Nathan: "Yeah!"

Luna: "Aha, yea." *She grunted in agreement.*

Destiny: "Yeup!"

Rachael: *She smiled, forming a fist.* "The Elemental Tower, where's that?"

Trevour: "This way." *He smiled and hobbled forward, causing his armour to rattle.*

Keeper: *She watched the guild suddenly run out of the tavern, causing her to look confused.* (They better not die.. I actually like hearing some of their strange conversations.)

----------

*Twortz and Sofia flashstepped into a large stone room with everything painted different shades of silver.*

Sofia: "Here are your new clothes." *She nudged her head towards a rack of platinum coloured armour.*

Twortz: *She took a deep breath and suddenly looked uncomfortable, gently touching her arm.* "What-?"

Sofia: "The Rasticplash of being pulled into a flashstep. Get used to it."

Twortz: "That is no way to speak to your superior."

Sofia: "Hahehahe." *She laughed in a condescending-like manner.* "What a feat you pulled."

Twortz: "She had it coming. Are you going to judge me?"

Sofia: "Judge? No. I did the same thing."

Twortz: "By joining the captains?"

Sofia: "I was already a captain. I killed two others to gain my seat. One was Kieran and.. I can't seem to remember the other?" *She looked up, placing her finger on her lips in thought.*

Twortz: *She shook her head, as if she didn't care.* "Where is PKMY?"

Sofia: "Pee-Kay-Who?"

Twortz: "She's a captain, short red hair."

Sofia: "Oh! PKMY.. Yes, she recently ran away from the warriors."

Twortz: "But, this couldn't have been more than two years ago!"

Sofia: "Ya ha. Don't worry, we're trying to find her whereabouts."

Twortz: (So, she's still out there?!) *She frowned in thought.* (I will kill you, PKMY.)

----------

Madora: *She looked up and noticed two streams of white light blast out of a pool of aurora coloured lights in the sky.* "The people from Earth... The prophecy has just been set into motion."

?????: "Hoh?"

Madora: *She hobbled to the side and smiled at a woman with long curly blonde hair.* "You are to accompany the man that holds the prophecy."

?????: "What am I to do once completing such a trivial objective?" *She looked at Madora with an emotionless face, speaking in a monotone.*

Madora: "Terra, there is nothing trivial about prophecies."

Terra: "I am now known as Teresa."

Madora: "Oh deary, whatever you call yourself. You're still just a beautiful little girl in my eyes-"

Teresa: "I do not see how this current conversation reflects the importance of such prophecies."

Madora: "O-Oh-"

Teresa: "Inform me of my duties and I shall be on my way."

Madora: "Ensure Lance Lighten is not harmed."

Teresa: "Hoh?"

Madora: "This is a dangerous place to be in for an Outsider."

Teresa: "I do not follow."

Madora: "This man, he is not from this world."

Teresa: ".. Inconceivable."

Madora: "Like you, I don't have a reason to lie."

Teresa: "..."

Madora: "If he tells you this. Believe him, but don't make it a fuss."

Teresa: "I see."

Madora: "That is all I ask."

Teresa: "Of course." *She stepped forward, readying herself to leave.* "What is his prophecy?"

Madora: "Unfortunately, I cannot speak of it."

Teresa: "Tcch. I understand."

Madora: (Judging by the access point of those Aurorions-) "He is currently near The Frozen Backwater Village."

Teresa: "That is all I needed to know." *She spoke with a disappearing image, leaving behind a swirl of grass.*

Madora: (She's just as fast as her mother..) *She chuckled and slowly turned around, facing a door sized warp in the air.* "Without emotions, she doesn't question anything as far-fetched as another world."

*Madora slowly hobbled into the warped air, causing her image to fade into nothing.*

Madora: "The Unknown Territories, stopping the Consultant.. Best of luck, everyone."

----------

Lance: *He woke up with a throbbing headache and blurred vision.* "A-Arh-" *He shook his head and blinked several times, causing his vision to return to normal.*

*Lance found himself in a large circular dirt clearing, surrounded by thick trees.*

Lance: *He leant up and looked around at the scenery.* "Where-?" *He noticed Ashton, who lay unconscious on the dirt ground.*

*The thick trees drained the sunlight above, creating an eerie-like appearance.*

Lance: *He hovered over Ashton and started to rock him back and forth.* "Hey-"

Ashton: "..." *He moaned and remained motionless.*

Lance: "H-Hey, Ashton, wake up." *He nervously slapped him on the cheek, as he tried to wake him up.* "Come on, wake up, Ash-"

Ashton: *He slowly opened his eyes and appeared disoriented.* "Argh-"

Lance: *He leant back and sighed with relief.* "Phew, how ya feelin'?"

Ashton: "My head hurts-" *He groaned and spoke softly.*

*The dirt path was surrounded by thick trees, resulting in a linear-like trail.*

Ashton: *He leant up and coughed.* "Where are we? In a park?"

Lance: *He looked down the path and noticed it forked at the end.* "I don't know."

Ashton: "How long have we been out for?" *He held his head and looked around with confusion.*

Background:
Luna! I get mixed feelings from her. A feisty, powerful upfront attitude, yet, she's cutting herself and shows depression? I'm confused. We need to know more about her!
She adjusts to the world in a strange-like manner, first thinking it's a game, which caused her to get hit directly with a Rostical, resulting in her becoming blind, then after coming to realisation, swears, then eventually gets over it.
She Soul Links with Destiny who aids her with vision. To be honest, I think Luna has still yet grasped the realisation of her situation. Hopefully that suicidal depression doesn't kick in again.
