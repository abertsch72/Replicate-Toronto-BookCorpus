Chapter 1: Valkyrie

*One side of the sky was orange and the other blue, due to the setting sun.*

Ridley: *He smirked and looked down, staring at the white pebbles under his feet.* "I feel that these type of actions are inexcusable, but, Surpreon has given me a lot of grief."

*Ridley sighed and paused, listening to the lively sounds of people coming from inside the city.*

Ridley: "This certain memory stays strong with me." *He looked up and admired the grey sphere-like structure in front of him, triggering a flashback.*

-

*Riddle and Tyler worked independently by themselves in Surpreon's research facility.*

Tyler: *He thoroughly typed on a keyboard-like console, as multiple red dots came on the screen.* (I need to pinpoint the random attacks warriors have-)

*A small barrier in front of Ridley started to glow, causing Tyler to pause momentarily.*

Riddle: "Hmm?" *He closely observed the small barrier, causing him to quickly write down details on a notepad.* "Tyler?"

Tyler: *He sighed and stopped typing, looking over his shoulder to Riddle.* "Yes?"

Riddle: "I'm a little confused with these barriers." *He lowered the notepad, frowning in a curious manner.*

Tyler: "A barrier-?" *He stood up and slowly walked towards him.* "What are you confused about? The formula of one?"

Riddle: "Oh, certainly not-" *He rolled his eyes and waved his hand, disregarding Tyler's question.*

Tyler: "So.. What is it?"

Riddle: "Well, I'm trying to create a powerful barrier, but I can't seem to base the level of power."

Tyler: (Base the level of power?) *He quivered his lips in confusion.*

Riddle: "And I admit, I'm having a lot of difficulty with this." *He continued to observe the small circular barrier in a fascinated manner.*

Tyler: *He shook his head, avoiding several computer-like consoles.* "I'm sorry, I don't understand?" *He stopped next to Riddle and stared at the barrier, noticing several glyphic symbols rotate around it.*

Riddle: *He slightly bent forward, further inspecting his experiment.* "I want to create a miniature shield, but with the power of a large shield."

Tyler: "Ah-" *He nodded his head in understanding.* (That's a smart idea-)

Riddle: "But the problem is, I can't find a barrier strong enough to revise the formula into the experiment."

Tyler: "I understand now-" (I see what he means, it's much easier to edit formulas than to create something from scratch-)

Riddle: *He shook his head in a defeated manner and turned around, facing Tyler for ideas.* "Do you have or know anything that could help me out?"

Tyler: "Umm-" *He slowly looked up to the roof, scratching the pimples on his face in thought.*

Riddle: *He looked away, pouting in a bored manner.* (I knew I shouldn't have wasted my time asking him-)

Tyler: "Wait-" *He snapped his fingers, as his face lit up with thought.*

Riddle: "Y-Yes?" *He stuttered, hiding his slight excitement.*

Tyler: "Why not Surpreon itself?"

Riddle: "Excuse me?" *He shook his head in confusion.*

Tyler: "Oh.." *He sounded regretful, quickly looking away in a guilty manner.*

Riddle: "Tyler?"

Tyler: "I thought you would've known about.. It, because you're Season's loyal researcher-"

Riddle: "About what?" *He spoke in an annoyed manner, pushing up his glasses with two fingers.*

Tyler: "Well-" *He paused as if he didn't want to say.*

Riddle: "As you said, I'm one of Season's close researchers."

Tyler: "Yeah." *He whined under his breath, sounding unsure.*

Riddle: "Also, if I don't know about something, I may not be able to react to it in time if something were to occur."

Tyler: (He has a point...) *He sighed, nodding his head in understanding.* "Surpreon's barrier."

Riddle: "The outer shell... What about it?"

Tyler: "No, the one in the sky."

Riddle: "Pardon?" *He tilted his head in a curious manner, adjusting his glasses.*

Tyler: "Haven't you ever wondered why Surpreon never experiences aerial attacks?"

Riddle: "Now, come to think of it, yes, I have wondered that?"

Tyler: "Surpreon's barrier is kept secret, as it's the strongest yet only weakness to the city."

Riddle: "Oh, this is getting interesting-" *He leant on the bench behind him, focusing all his attention to Tyler.*

Tyler: "Well, the outer shell is impenetrable."

Riddle: (If it's impenetrable, then why is it a weakness?)

Tyler: "While the multi-layered barrier above Surpreon is said to be the strongest known barrier to ever have existed."

Riddle: "How do you know this?"

Tyler: "The glyphic formulas have a precision of Astragons which are adjusted at different frequencies."

Riddle: "Different frequencies? I haven't heard of Astragons being used for a barrier in such a manner."

Tyler: "The idea was based off Score Users and how they draw the Astragons through different toned hymns or singing."

Riddle: "Please continue."

Tyler: (He can keep up so easily-) "Well, due to these frequencies, the shield is able to detect the opposite frequency used and bounce it back."

Riddle: "Similar to the properties of magnetism?"

Tyler: *He looked shocked, slowly nodding his head.* "Yes, that's a good example."

Riddle: (Fascinating, I'd never expected Surpreon to have such a highly advanced shield-)

Tyler: "And that's how the shield works."

Riddle: "How exactly do you know this?" *He sounded unconvinced as if Tyler was making it up.*

Tyler: "Season granted me access to his personal documents."

Riddle: "Hmm." *He sounded slightly jealous.* "So, if this is the strongest barrier, how is it a weakness?"

Tyler: "The chances are so small it's not even worth mentioning, but if the barrier were to somehow break-" *He paused, losing attention in thought.*

Riddle: (If something very powerful like an impenetrable shield were to collapse.. The recoil force would act as an explosion..-) *He thought in realisation, observing Tyler's facial expressions.*

Tyler: "The destruction..." *He struggled to speak as the thought caused him to become emotional.*

Riddle: *He raised his hand and shook his head.* "Say no more. Having the strongest known barrier will help this experiment tenfold."

Tyler: "G-Great."

Riddle: "Yes." *He nodded his head as if he ended the conversation.*

Tyler: *He faced the console he was using and started to walk towards it.* "Oh-" *He paused, looking over his shoulder to Riddle.* "I might actually need your help."

Riddle: "Oh yes?"

Tyler: "I need help calculating the possible areas of future attacks and detailing them in percentages."

Riddle: *His confused grin was filled with curiosity as he walked towards Tyler.* "Explain furthermore."

Tyler: "Well-"

-

Ridley: *He smirked as cicadas started to buzz in the background.* "Well then." *He slowly and deeply inhaled through his nose, mentally preparing himself.*

----------

Lance: *He rested his back against a large sakura tree, listening to its pink leaves rustle in the warm wind.* (She left...)

*Lance twirled a pink leaf in between his fingers, staring at it in thought.*

Lance: (Why...?)

Holland: *He looked across the large beautiful garden, staring at Lance in a worried manner.* (Poor guy, he's been sitting there for hours-)

PKMY: *She walked through a door in flames and stepped onto a veranda, listening to wood creak under her feet.* "OK."

Holland: *He smirked and looked at PKMY, watching her walk towards him.* "So what's the go?"

PKMY: *She looked up to the evening sky and sighed, before looking at Holland.* "Arcadia is currently in the realm of Valhalla, but when she's awake, she'll transport us out of here."

Holland: "Great, where?"

PKMY: (Huh-?) *Her attention drifted to the side and she stared at Lance, noticing his sad face.* "..."

Holland: "Amy?"

PKMY: (That shithead-)

Holland: "Amy?"

PKMY: "Tssk-" *She grunted, looking at Holland in an annoyed manner.* "Wat?"

Holland: "Where are we going?"

PKMY: "Oh, to Silver Wind Island. Then we can get to Surpreon."

Holland: "Cool." *He mumbled in satisfaction and looked back to Lance, raising an eyebrow in a curious manner.* "What was with the strange stare?"

PKMY: "I felt his emotions for a moment."

Holland: "Can't you block your abilities so you don't randomly feel negative emotions?" *He mumbled and looked at PKMY, scratching under his chin with curiosity.*

PKMY: "I'm not used to sealing and sending my empathic powers just yet."

Holland: "Okay. So, what did you feel?"

PKMY: "Eh? The try-hard is upset."

Holland: "Yeah, he didn't take the whole Alicia going away too well, did he?"

PKMY: "Obviously-" *She grunted and quickly inhaled, cupping her hands over her mouth.* "Oi, asswipe!"

Lance: "..." *He slowly looked over to PKMY, frowning with a mixture of sadness.*

PKMY: "Stop sulking and get up."

Lance: "Sulkin'? She left-"

PKMY: "And so did you! You left to find that stupid sword."

Lance: *He looked shocked, causing him to pay attention to the leaf in his hand.* "Yea, but-"

PKMY: "We're going to Silver Wind Island, and I'm not leaving you here by yourself."

Lance: "Leave me."

PKMY: *She frowned with a twitching eye.* "Wat did you say?"

Holland: *He kept quiet and placed his hands on the back of his head, pretending not to listen.* (Things might get ugly, those two have dominant attitudes-)

Lance: "I said-"

PKMY: *She took a step forward, flashstepping in front of Lance.* "And I said, we're not leaving you here."

Lance: "Wat if she comes back, and-?"

PKMY: *She bent forward, slapping the leaf out of Lance's hand.* "The amount of times I've seen or heard you go through this stupid sad stage is absolutely pathetic-"

Lance: "Pathetic?" *He grunted in realisation and leant off the tree, stamping his foot at PKMY.* "Pathetic? Wateva, I'll show you who's pathetic!"

Holland: *He took several steps towards Lance and PKMY.* "Alicia said she knew what to do-" *He paused and walked up to them.* "She also used a teleportation type Rostical."

Lance: (Teleportation? Alicia?) *He thought in surprise.*

PKMY: *She looked up to Holland, nodding her head.* "Her quality of power was different."

Lance: "Different?"

PKMY: "It was hidden, but when I rethink it over, the quality was similar to yours when you woke up from Arcadia's dream state."

Lance: "Oh.." *He looked down, grunting in recollection.* (Then, she must've got a big power-up too.)

PKMY: *She closed her eyes and slowly inhaled.* (I sense his restlessness has passed...)

Lance: "So... How are we goin' to Silver Wind Island?"

Holland: (That's better.) *He smirked in thought, looking at the darkening sky.*

PKMY: "As I said, Arcadia will-"

Ginger: *She wheeled Arcadia out of the house and faced the party.* "Ey? Arcadia will what? Please respond."

Arcadia: *She stared at the party with her hazel and red eyes.* "Send them to Silver Wind Island."

PKMY: *She quickly faced Arcadia, nodding her head in respect.* "Yes."

Holland: "Thank you, for your hospitality."

Arcadia: *She noticed Holland walking towards her, causing her to nudge Ginger.* "You will be needing this." *She smiled, presenting a stone to Ginger.*

Ginger: "A teleportation stone? Please respond."

Arcadia: "Yes. Pour your Neurons into it, you should know what to do."

Ginger: "Naturally." *She grabbed the stone and tightly held it with one hand, causing it to instantly glow purple.*

Holland: *He walked up to Ginger and stared at the glowing stone.* "Do we need to do anything to it?"

Ginger: "Ey, it's already activated."

Holland: "Thank you again."

Ginger: *She looked past Holland, staring at Lance.* "Pardon your insolent friend-" *She quietly hissed at Holland, causing Arcadia to raise her hand.*

Arcadia: "Enough."

Ginger: *She gritted her teeth and presented the glowing stone to Holland.* "Ykkt."

Holland: *He glanced at the stone and looked at Ginger, staring at the bandages around her arms.* (Ginger is powerful, she was able to withstand her own against Amy and myself-)

Ginger: "Are you going to take it, or just stare at it? Please respond." *She sounded impatient, flicking her long black hair over her shoulder.*

Holland: "I was thinking-" *He gently but quickly grabbed the stone from Ginger's hand.* "Is there anything we can do to repay your kind generosity?"

Arcadia: *She closed her eyes and looked to each side, causing her body to shine a shade of white.* "All you can do-" *She opened her eyes, sighing in exhaustion.* "-Is stop the Consultant's plan."

Holland: "Alright, I think we could give that a go." *He smirked as if he was happy to fulfil Arcadia's desire.*

Lance: *He folded his arms like a child and tapped his feet, trying to listen to Holland's mumbles.* "Oi, come on."

PKMY: *She looked up the red sky, noticing several stars.* (Now that my training has finished, I think I can hold my own against the Consultant now-)

*PKMY grunted in thought, triggering flashbacks of Ridley fighting the entire party at Surpreon.*

Holland: *He firmly held onto the stone and turned around, jogging up to PKMY.* "Here, I can't activate it."

PKMY: *She smirked at Holland and lowered her head, grabbing the stone out of his hand.* "OK-"

Arcadia: "Before you go." *She wheeled forward, instantly drawing the party's attention towards her.*

Lance: *He sighed and rolled his eyes.* (I just wanna leave, I want to see what's everyone up to...)

*Lance spun around without a care and watched pink leaves float in the garden's river-like pond.*

Lance: (And see what the effing shit Alicia is doin'.)

Arcadia: "I had a few visions as of late."

PKMY: "Yes?"
Lance: "Aye?" *He focused his attention back to Arcadia as if he was interested in what she had to say.*

Arcadia: "There were a lot of war-like battles."

Holland: "War?"

Lance: (War? That doesn't sound good.)

PKMY: "Against what? Warriors?"

Holland: "Scoldrants?" *He nervously mumbled as if he didn't want Arcadia to confirm his question.*

Arcadia: "They were neither, they were something I've never seen before."

PKMY: "Tssk." *She formed fists and looked worried, speculating what it could be.*

Holland: (A war... I remember stories about my ancestors going into war with the Sacred Dancers... There was a lot of deaths-)

Arcadia: "I bid you all farewell-"

Lance: "Whoa, slow down."

Arcadia: "What is the matter?"

Lance: "What do they look like?"

Arcadia: "They were like the walking dead-"

PKMY: "Eh?" *She tried to hide her shock, catching Lance and Holland's attention.*

Holland: *He intensely stared at Arcadia.* "Really?"

Lance: "Pssht, who cares."

Holland: "Lance?"

Lance: "We've been in that ghost ship, there's nothin' me 'n' my friends ain't scared of, aye."

PKMY: "Heh." *She smirked with growing morale, looking at Lance like he was an idiot.*

Lance: "So, where were we when we fought them-?"

Arcadia: "I-I don't know-" *She mumbled in fatigue, causing Ginger to step in front of her.*

Ginger: "As illogical as it is for her not to deliver detailed facts, she has been under a lot of strain-"

Lance: "But, she didn't give us shit! Besides forewarn us about somethin' that's gonna get us paranoid-"

Ginger: *She frowned and stepped forward, reaching towards her bandages.* "You know of events that have yet to pass, your response is almost contemptuous of her assistance."

PKMY: "Tssk, Lance, enough."

Lance: *He looked at PKMY annoyed and grunted in respect, turning around as if he didn't care.* "Wateva."

PKMY: *She leant to one side, looking at Arcadia.* "I hope to see you again."

Arcadia: "..." *She nodded her head in response.* (I'm sure you all will do your best-) *She watched the party face each other in a triangular pattern.*

PKMY: (Since Neurons have already activated the stone, time to start adjusting the Astragons to-) *She closed her eyes, causing a purple glyph to form itself on the ground around the party.*

Lance: *He looked down, watching the glyph form its intricate patterns.* (It's not like I was bein' ungrateful, but seriously, we're goin' to be in a war and that's it? Such bullshit, aye.)

Holland: (This was a good village that served fantastic foods-) *He smirked in thought, ignoring the purple light which glowed underneath him.* (I'll definitely be coming back here sometime.)

Lance: *He sighed, focusing on the glyph's glow.* (I remember how sick I felt when I first went on these glyphys-) *He smirked at himself, recalling the first time he teleported.*

PKMY: (Holly, I'm not sure what foes Arcadia was talking about, but I'm getting this weird vibe.)

Holland: (Well, I'm a little nervous, but I'll make sure, I'll be by your side no matter whatever happens-)

PKMY: "D-Don't give me that romantic crap." *She faced away from Holland and smiled, covering her blushing cheeks.*

Holland: (Amy..) *He stared at PKMY's back, smiling at her reaction.*

Lance: *He opened his mouth in shock, giving PKMY a feral look.* "Wut?! I didn't do anythin' this time!"

Holland: *He sighed and looked up, staring at the stars in thought.* (Even with what Amy and Arcadia said, I can tell something is wrong with the way the wind blows-)

*Holland closed his eyes, feeling the warm wind brush past him.*

Holland: (I can't understand how to describe it, Freya?)

-

Freya: *She lay on the ground in darkness and looked up.* (I sense something from the continent too, it feels like there's going to be a lot of blood spilt.) *Her voice echoed in Holland's inner-self.*

-

Holland: *He opened his eyes and stared at the glyph in a worried manner, watching the lines connect to each other.* (I was hoping the time for spilling blood would end soon-)

PKMY: "Pfft!" *She looked at Lance and frowned with a twitching eye.* "Not you-"

Lance: "Wateva."

PKMY: *She formed a fist in a threatening manner.* "Tssk, wateva your wateva."

Lance: "Wateva your watevs of ultimate watevs! So, wateva."

*Arcadia and Ginger gave the party a strange look, watching them disappear in a flash of purple light.*

Ginger: "Ey, Arcadia.. That was, illogical? Please respond."

Arcadia: "It was.."

Ginger: "Yohoho, then why did you put so much effort into those fools?"

Arcadia: "Because those fools are the ones to defeat the Consultant..."

Ginger: "E-Ey?" *She looked shocked, staring at Arcadia with widening eyes.*

Arcadia: "I foresaw it."

----------

*Alicia and Celest appeared on a large floating island, enveloped in a swirl of bright white light.*

Celest: *She quickly walked out of the fading light and looked down, watching a flock of doves fly above the clouds.* "Thy-.. I wasn't expecting you."

Alicia: *She waved light out of her face, staring at Celest's back.* "..."

Celest: "What brings you here so early?" *She spoke in a happy, chirpy tone, trying to hide her awkwardness.*

Alicia: *She had a vivid flashback of Celest revealing her relation to her.* "I'm here for other reasons, but I want to talk about what you said to me last-"

Celest: "About-" *She paused as a cold howl-like breeze blew past her.* "-Me being your mother?"

Alicia: "Why did you say something like that?" *She spoke with an emotionless face, as if she didn't have time to play games.*

Celest: *She sighed and awkwardly folded her arms as if she was cold.* "I do not lie."

Alicia: *She looked down to the swaying grass and formed fists.* "Then, explain yourself!"

Celest: "..." *She remained quiet, as she stood motionlessly.*

Alicia: "Answer me!"

Celest: "I'm sorry-" *She whispered, causing Alicia to shake her head in confusion.*

Alicia: "What?"

Celest: *She dropped to her knees, causing Alicia to step forward in shock.* "I am sorry!"

Alicia: "If what you say is true-"

Celest: "Aliciana, explain your healing abilities, explain your purpose, explain your pendant, explain that unshakable feeling of adventure."

Alicia: *She gasped and stepped back.* (No one knows about that horrible feeling. How I get restless, my urge to always wanting to explore the land-)

Celest: "I hated that it had to be our daughter." *She sighed, shaking her head in recollection.*

Alicia: "Our?"

Celest: "..." *She paused and sighed again.* "Your father."

Alicia: "D-" *Her eyes widened and she shook her head.* "Dad?"

Celest: "He grew ill, but at least you got to meet him once."

Alicia: "Ill? Ill of what? Where is he now?"

Celest: "He grew ill, as he lost his power of Radiatons."

Alicia: "Where are they?"

Celest: "He gave them to The Philosopher's Heart."

Alicia: "..." *She was unable to speak, slightly moving her mouth in confusion.*

Celest: "There was growing doubt, filling the minds of people in Valhalla."

Alicia: "What about?"

Celest: "The inability of the awakening."

Alicia: "Awakening of what?"

Celest: "The Valkyrie.. So, my partner, your father, thought, if he gave his powers to the Valkyrie, it might manifest itself-" *She whimpered, causing her to stop in mid-sentence.*

Alicia: (Father..) *She took a step forward.* "W-Why did you give me away?"

Celest: "Give you away?" *She turned around with a disgusted face, causing Alicia to nervously look away.*

Alicia: *She avoided eye contact, feeling uncomfortable.* "Y-Yes."

Celest: "I did not give you away, you were essentially taken from me."

Alicia: "What are you talking about?"

Celest: "You were chosen, you were one-" *She paused and looked down to the grass, watching it sway with a frown.* "The chosen one, selected for an upcoming major prophecy."

Alicia: "Which one?"

Celest: "Sealing of the final glyph, to prevent the Consultant's plans."

Alicia: *She looked down, biting her bottom lip in failure.* "The Consultant-"

Celest: "Is alive."

Alicia: *She looked up in shock.* "How do you know?"

Celest: *She paused in silence and felt another cool breeze brush past her, gently swaying her hair to one side.* "The Wise will deal with it."

Alicia: *She paused, subconsciously running her finger along the pendant's chain.* "Why did you say I was taken away?"

Celest: "My selfishness nearly cost me the respect of the entire city."

Alicia: "W-Why?"

Celest: "Because I wanted to keep you, even knowing the destiny that was bestowed upon you."

Alicia: "U-Umm-"

Celest: "But, if I had to give you up, I wanted to protect you at the same time."

Alicia: "I.. I don't know what to say." *She spoke under her breath in disbelief, as if she didn't believe what she was hearing.*

Celest: "The pendant, it was a special Rosterology item with the powers of myself and Fabion."

Alicia: "Fabion?"

Celest: "Your father."

Alicia: *She looked down, holding the sun-shaped pendant in her hand.* "..."

Celest: "I've watched you grow up, and I am really proud of you."

Alicia: *She grasped the pendant with both hands, slowly exhaling.* "..."

Celest: "Watching you from such a young age, made me miss you even more.. It was immeasurable.." *She grabbed a handful of grass in each hand, gritting her teeth with watering eyes.* "I wished to hold you in my arms-"

Alicia: "C-Celest-" *She stepped forward, staring at Celest with glazing eyes.*

Celest: "You may think anything of me-" *She shuffled her body and faced Alicia, letting go of the grass in her hands.* "But do not ever say, I gave you away willingly."

Alicia: *She squinted her eyes and formed fists.* "I-"

Celest: "Fabion loved you too..."

Alicia: "I-..." *She shook her head and ran up to Celest, suddenly bear tackling her.*

Celest: *She lay on her back with surprise, watching Alicia tightly wrap her arms around her.* "Aliciana?"

Alicia: "Celest..."

Celest: *She paused and smiled, embracing Alicia.* (Calling me mother now would seem uncomfortable, but this is-) *She closed her eyes and gently held the back of Alicia's head.*

Alicia: *She closed her eyes and silently embraced Celest, smiling in a safe-like manner.* (Celest...)

*A gust of wind filled with flower petals blew past Alicia and Celest, blowing their hair to one side.*

Alicia: *She opened her eyes and slowly stood up, helping Celest back onto her feet.* "I-I would like to spend more time with you."

Celest: "Ahem." *She sniffed and coughed, regaining her professional-like composure.*

Alicia: (Despite it feeling right, this is a lot to take in.) *She wiped under her eyes and looked at Celest, unsure what to say.*

Celest: "Your original intentions?" *She effectively changed the subject, brushing grass off her clothes.*

Alicia: *She nodded her head as if she forgot why she was there.* "I-I need to give The Voice of On an answer."

Celest: *She nodded her head in understanding, as if she knew what Alicia had to do.* "Let us go to The Imperial Glacial Castle and you may speak with the divine entity."

Alicia: "It was the hardest choice I've ever had to make..." *She whispered to herself, distracted in thought.*

Celest: "Aliciana?" *She looked interested and reached out, holding onto Alicia's hand.*

Alicia: "Divine entity, what exactly is The Voice of On?"

Celest: "Some experts believe it's the Valkyrie's subconscious waiting for its next awakening."

Alicia: "W-Wow."
Celest: "While others believe, it's the scraps of power left behind by the Valkyrie."

Alicia: "Why scraps?"

Celest: "The Valkyrie's power is so vast, that the resonance of its power, is, The Voice of On."

Alicia: (The Valkyrie must be incredibly powerful-)

Celest: "As we go, would you mind me asking what your decision was?"

Alicia: *She wiped the dry tears off her face and thought of Pickles, causing her to smile.* "My decision, I chose to-"

*A piercing glass-like screech echoed throughout the air, causing Alicia and Celest to cup their ears in pain.*

Alicia: (What is this?!) *Visible sound waves blasted against her, violently blowing her hair and pendant back.*

Celest: (Something is wrong!-) "MYSTIC SHIELD" *A solid square-shaped shield built itself around them, causing the outside sounds to mute.*

Alicia: *She rubbed her ears in disorientation and sighed, lowering her arms in relief.* "S-Sorry...?"

Celest: *She clicked her fingers next to her ears and looked into the distance in shock.* "I have no idea what that was."

Alicia: *She spun around, scanning the sky for any enemies in the air.* "I don't see anything that could've made that sound."

Celest: *She closed her eyes and concentrated on the Radiatons outside the shield.* "Whatever that sound was, it's gone now-" *She clicked her fingers, causing the shield to shatter.*

Alicia: (Just in case-) *She raised her hands, bracing herself for the sound.* (The sound.. She's right, it's gone-)

Celest: "That sound-" *She glanced into the distance with interest and confusion.*

Alicia: *She lowered her arms, looking at Celest.* "What about it? Do you know what it was?"

Celest: "No, but it's in the direction of The Imperial Glacial Castle-"

Alicia: (Where I need to go to talk to PKMY-, I mean, The Voice of On-)

Celest: "Come-" *She touched Alicia's hand and held her fingertips.*

Alicia: "Let's go." *She nodded her head once as if she was giving confirmation she was ready to go.*

Celest: *She looked to her side and smiled in a motherly manner.* "Hmph-"

*Alicia and Celest disappeared in a flash of bright white light, causing the grass to swirl in a circular motion.*

----------

*Lorilei and members of The Wise stared into the distance with terrified facial expressions.*

Locki: *He sat on his knees hunched forward, shaking his head in disbelief.* "Thy have not felt such humiliation, despair-"

*Alicia and Celest appeared in a swirl of bright white light, causing Locki to pause.*

Celest: *She stepped forward in an urgent manner, failing to notice the surrounding devastation.* "Locki, something happened-"

Cassidy: *He dived up above the floating island and swirled down, landing on the grass next to Locki.* (The destruction was worse than I thought-)

The Wise: *He impatiently stared at Cassidy and stepped forward.* "Report!"

Cassidy: *He bowed to one knee, placing his right hand on the ground.* "The structure was completely destroyed-"

*Cassidy's words caused several gasps of disbelief and sadness, catching Celest's attention.*

Celest: *She looked at Cassidy, shaking her head in confusion.* "What was destroyed-?"

Cassidy: "There were two casualties, and.." *He paused, trying to talk with a clear throat.*

Celest: "What is going on?"

Alicia: "..." *She stood closer to Celest, noticing the party's depressed faces.* (We weren't gone for long, what happened?)

Locki: *He sniffed and continued to shake his head.* (A failure-)

Cassidy: "There were also two fatalities."

Lorilei: "Oh my!-" *She looked at Cassidy, covering her mouth in shock.*

The Wise: *A tall hooded man looked down, whispering under his breath.* "Pray to the Radiatons on a safe journey to The Astral Plains."

Celest: "Fatalities? What has happened?!"

Cassidy: "There was also another thing."

The Wise: *A man stamped his foot in frustration as if he didn't want to hear more bad news.* "Explain!"

Cassidy: "Thy glided throughout the entire castle to search for casualties and-"

The Wise: "Get to it."

Cassidy: "A glass cabinet holding a powerful item was missing."

The Wise: "Missing?"

Celest: "Thy demand to know what has hap-" *She looked around in frustration and suddenly noticed the missing island.* (Huh?)

*Celest's awkward pause caught Alicia's attention.*

Alicia: (Celest-?) *She looked confused, watching Celest twitch in a shocked manner.*

Celest: "W-W-W-?" *She stuttered, facing the vacant space with widening eyes.*

Locki: "The sound thou might have heard, was the destruction of The Imperial Glacial Castle."

Alicia: (Destruction?) *She had flashbacks of its integral structure, causing her to shake her head in disbelief.* "From what I gathered, the castle was near impenetrable-"

The Wise: *A small woman figure in robes stepped forward.* "To those who are not of Sacred Knight status, please leave." *Her voice caused several men with radiant wings to fly off the island.*

Locki: (Celest?)

Celest: *She looked at Locki, before focusing her attention on the woman in robes.* (I understand-) "Aliciana."

Alicia: "Yes?" *She nervously whispered to Celest, as if she didn't want to draw unwanted attention.*

Celest: *She ignored Alicia, giving the woman in robes all her attention.* "Thy will be back shortly."

The Wise: *She nodded her head, watching Alicia and Celest disappear in a flash of white light.* "Do not be too long!"

Celest: "Of course." *She spoke with an echoing voice.*

----------

Ridley: *He reached behind his back and pulled his arm forward, causing sparks to scatter around his hand.* "With this-"

*Several villagers walked past Ridley and towards the entrance of Surpreon, listening to white pebbles crunch under their feet.*

Villager: "Battling Oxident isn't due for another-" *Their voices muffled, as they entered Surpreon, causing the walls to ripple like water around them.*

Ridley: *He smiled and rubbed a small stone with hieroglyphs on it.* "My last Fiftydeduction."

----------

*Alicia and Celest appeared on The Divine Path, as bundles of light disappeared around them.*

Alicia: "Huh?" *She noticed the glow of the path.* "What are we doing? I haven't given my answer-"

Celest: *She sighed, hiding her sadness.* "Where exactly do you need to be to give The Voice of On your answer?"

Alicia: "The ice castle-" *She stopped in mid-sentence, realising what the problem was.*

Celest: "Something like this has never happened in my lifetime. Thy need to go back and assist whatever is needed of me."

Alicia: *She sighed in disappointment and understanding.* "Yes."

Celest: (She holds a lot of weight on her shoulders-) "For now, go back and help your friends."

Alicia: *She slightly smiled and nodded her head, biting her bottom lip.* "Y-Yep."

Celest: *She closed her eyes and took a long deep breath.* "..."

Alicia: "Celest?"

Celest: *She opened her eyes and looked serious.* "It has been amazing seeing you, Aliciana."

Alicia: "Why can't I stay?" *She raised her arm, causing powder-like light to swirl around her hands.* "I can help heal-"

Celest: *She looked sad and shook her head, slowly turning away.* "Until next time, my beloved daughter-"

Alicia: "Don't leave me in the dark! I want to stay and help my home!"

Celest: *A tear ran down her face and she clicked her fingers, causing swirls of white light to envelop Alicia.* "I'll send you to Silver Wind Island, that way it's near Arcadia-"

Alicia: "Let me stay!" *She nervously shouted, cutting Celest off in mid-sentence.*

Celest: "I will see you next time-"

Alicia: "No!-" *Bright light blinded her, causing her to cover her eyes in disorientation.*

--

Celest: *She flashstepped in front of Locki, Cassidy, Lorilei and The Wise.* "It is done-" *She spoke in a professional manner, slightly bowing in respect.*

The Wise: "Excellent-" *He spoke to Celest and faced Cassidy.* "Cassidy."

Cassidy: *He quickly faced the hooded member of The Wise, lowering his head.* "Yes?"

The Wise: "What item was stolen?"

Cassidy: "Thy believe it was the Matter Conductor." *He sounded unsure as if he didn't know what the item was.*

Locki: (The Matter Conductor?!)

Celest: *She gasped in shock, instantly looking at Locki in a worried manner.* "That isn't good."

*Lorilei and Cassidy looked at each other in confusion, discreetly shrugging their shoulders.*

Locki: (Cassidy, Raphael and Lorilei are the only ones that didn't know what that artefact is-)

Lorilei: "The Matter Conductor? I've never heard of that."

Cassidy: "That's what the label said, what is it?"

The Wise: "The Matter Conductor, it's a rare item, taken from the discharges of powerful lightning storms."

Locki: *He stood up, facing Cassidy and Lorilei.* "What it does, is that it absorbs any sort of natural energy and stores it limitlessly."

Celest: "Until it's released."

Cassidy: "That seems like a unique item, but it doesn't sound so threatening-"

The Wise: "It has been storing the power of Valhalla's frightening storms below for some time."

Lorilei: (The storms below are always cyclonic level-) "That would be strong, but as Cassidy said, it doesn't sound like something that would warrant those faces of yours-"

Celest: "It has not been discharged in a natural lifetime."

*Lorilei and Cassidy gasped at the thought, slowly looking at each other with dropping jaws.*

Cassidy: "Who is this man? How is it possible, that a wingless peasant has obtained such power-?"

Lorilei: "What exactly is this man?"

The Wise: *A small hooded man shook his head.* "Actually, how did he come to knowledge of such an artefact that not even our Sacred Knights knew of?"

Locki: "Hmm..." *He moaned in thought, catching the party's attention.*

Cassidy: "Locki?"

Locki: "The question is, what is he going to do with it?"

----------

Ridley: "I remember a time when teleporting was a rare occurrence. Now it seems everyone has the power to do so-"

*Ridley had flashbacks of the party, random captains, Scoldrants and The Rostical Guild teleporting in a flash of purple light.*

Ridley: "I don't believe they are worthy of knowing such things."

*Ridley spoke in an authority-like manner, listening to the sounds of distant waves being carried in the wind.*

Ridley: "Before I get started, why don't I validate Tyler's knowledge-?" *His body glowed a shade of blue.* "Crimson Shade."

*Ridley raised his arm and opened his hand, causing black and red lightning to fall from the sky above Surpreon.*

Ridley: *He noticed the lightning stop in mid-air as a powerful force caused the lightning to curve.* "Hmm?"

*Multiple layers of massive white glyphs materialised and spiralled above Surpreon, causing Ridley to gasp in amazement.*

Ridley: "Astonishing!" *He intensely stared at the glyphs, shaking his head with a chuckle.* "Those glyphs-"

*The glyphs spiralled faster, causing the lightning to spark backwards and disintegrate into the air.*

Ridley: (He.. Was not wrong.)

*Ridley whispered to himself in shock, staring at the spiralling glyphs above Surpreon.*

Ridley: (That shield... I've never seen such a blend of differently used symbols before.)

*The white glyphs slowly stopped their spiral movement, causing them to warp and turn invisible.*

Ridley: (That shield is undoubtedly Radiaton filled.)

*Ridley frowned in excitement, staring at the vacant space above Surpreon.*

Ridley: "But, with the right combination of items and power, I have devised a way to shoot two birds with one stone." *He happily smiled with an upbeat attitude, slowly raising his arm.*

*Ridley watched a silver rod with red hieroglyphs engraved on it suddenly materialised in his hand.*

Ridley: *He lowered his arm, inspecting the red hieroglyphs on the silver rod in a curious manner.* "The Matter Conductor..."

*Ridley smirked and stared at the stone in his other hand, causing him to chuckle.*

Ridley: "And with the Fiftydeductor-" *He suddenly threw the stone directly above him, causing purple glyphs to spiral in the air around him.*

*Ridley unexpectedly spun around and rammed the silver rod into the ground, causing a cluster of violet symbols to appear around it.*

Ridley: *He watched the violet glyphs spiral around the rod with an evil-like smirk.* (The power of this self-made Remenistal will cause an intentionally powerful discharge-)

*The violet and purple glyphs started to expand, causing them to touch.*

Ridley: *He watched the glyphs spark off each other, listening to metallic-like static sounds echo from them.* "Draw the power of the forbidden spirits, and merge, come to my command-"

*The glyphs reacted to Ridley's incantation and suddenly merged into one purple-black ring-like glyph, which spiralled around him.*

Ridley: *He watched the glyph pulse a wave of white pebbles away from him, blowing his hair in a circular motion.* "With the seraphic powers of teleportation!-"

*Ridley shouted with an echoing voice and raised both arms, causing the purple-black glyph to split into three.*

Ridley: *He watched the three glyphs spiral up and down his body, causing his hair to rapidly flap to each side.* "Bend and use the space, power of cancellation!"

*The glyphs around Ridley suddenly shined and disappeared in a flash of purple light, teleporting itself above Surpreon.*

Ridley: *He looked up and watched the purple-black glyphs expand above Surpreon, causing him to smirk in accomplishment.* "Now!-"

*Ridley shouted at the top of his lungs, causing immense surges of wind to blow the pebbles around him.*

Ridley: "SEALING EQUATOR" *He focused all his attention to the three glyphic rings, watching them spiral and merge into one enormous thick glyphic platform.*

*The purple-black glyph spiralled at an increasing speed, causing swirls of visible wind to ring around the glyph.*

Ridley: (This feeling of excitement, stress, worry and fear... It reminds me of the fight with Raphael, Gabby-) *He watched the hieroglyphs in the glyph glow with gathering light.*

*Ridley focused with gritted teeth and enthusiastically dropped his arms, causing a purple-black beam to blast down out of the glyph.*

Ridley: *He sighed and leant forward, noticing his legs slightly buckle.* "Oh my-"

*Multiple layers of massive white glyphs materialised and spiralled above Surpreon, instantly blocking the purple-black beam.*

Ridley: *He watched the beam violently pulse against the first glyph, listening to metallic sounds screech in the air.* (This level of power, is simply astonishing!-)

*Glass-like cracks echoed from the first glyph, as the beam bent and warped the glyph.*

Ridley: *He continued to smile, watching the first glyph's light flicker.* "That is a very powerful barrier-"

*Two guards ran out of Surpreon's entrance and looked at Ridley in confusion as if he was the one creating the metallic screeches.*

Guard A: *He reached to the side, placing his hand on the handle to his sword.* "What are you doing?!"

Guard B: "What are those noises?!" *He cupped his hands and straightened his arms towards Ridley, causing a small red glyph to glow underneath his feet.*

Ridley: *He sighed with a smirk and pointed at the guards as if they weren't a problem.* "It's too late."

Guard A: "What are you-?" *Thunder rumbled in the sky, drawing his attention above Surpreon.*

Guard B: "What are those glyphs?!" *He gasped under his breath and lowered his arms, causing the red glyph to fade away.*

Guard A: *He shook his head in confusion, staring at the rotating glyphs in shock.* "What are they?"

Ridley: "Bless the Astragons on your safe journey to The Astral Plains." *He smirked at the guards who focused all their attention to the sky.*

Guard A: "What is that?" *He grunted, looking at the guard next to him.*

Guard B: "I don't know, I only know offensive fire Rostical." *He shook his head in response.*

Ridley: *He quickly looked back up, taking shorts breaths of anticipation.* (It's about to-)

*The glyph's light flickered off, causing a loud glass-like smash to echo.*

Ridley: *He squinted his eyes in an evil-like manner, watching the glyph shatter around the beam.* "Haha."

Guard B: *He watched the beam violently hit the next glyph, listening to a metallic screech echo off it.* "Those glyphs appear to be protecting Surpreon!-"

Ridley: "Hahahahaha."

Guard A: *An immense blast of wind pulsed around Surpreon, sliding him across the ground.* "What-?!"

Guard B: "Get back inside!-"

*The beam blasted straight through the other glyphs, shattering them in its path.*

Ridley: *He gasped with widening eyes, covering his face.* (The initial pause from the first glyph has caused a build-up of Neurons in the beam!-)

Guard A: "It shattered-?!"
Guard B: "Impossible!-"

*The ground violently rumbled, causing the guards to lose balance and fall onto their backs.*

Ridley: "Argh-" *He covered his eyes, as a blast of sand and pebbles blew past him.*

*The purple-black beam blasted down and hit the middle of Surpreon, causing all sounds to become mute.*

Ridley: *He gasped in realisation and quickly crossed his arms in a defensive manner.* "Swirling shadows flock, with the motion all will block-"

Guard B: "It's quiet?"
Guard A: "What was that constant screeching-?"

*A bright light shined above Surpreon, catching Ridley's attention.*

Ridley: "Darkness strikes hearts with fear-"

*A sphere-like eruption of violet flames exploded up into the air from the city.*

Ridley: "NIGHT SPHERE" *A swirl of mist-like shadow swirled around him.*

*The walls of Surpreon cracked and leaked violet flames, as the ground violently burst open.*

Guard A: (What's happening?!) *He thought in terror, staring at Surpreon's walls in disbelief.*

Ridley: *He looked nervous, as his heartbeat pounded through his chest.* (Come on-) *The shadow formed a transparent, black shield-like sphere around him, causing him to sigh in relief.*

*The walls of Surpreon blew up in an explosion of bright violet flames, causing the ground to erupt clusters of dirt.*

Guard A: "Urgh!-" *He disappeared in a cluster of dirt.*
Guard B: "Argh-?!" *He shouted, falling inside the ground.*

Ridley: (The first impact released a massive Rasticsplash of the built-up Neurons, destroying the city instantly!)

*Another explosion of bright red flames erupted from the violet flames, causing Ridley to gasp.*

Ridley: (Such power!-)

*A massive purple-black pulse rippled and exploded around Surpreon, ringing away from it and across the plains.*

Ridley: *He looked up, noticing the clouds in the sky distort due to the purple-black pulse.* (And that would be the sealing-)

*The pulse suddenly blasted past Ridley, causing the black shield to crack.*

Ridley: (Argh!-) *He wheezed in thought, gritting his teeth with all his focus.*

*The bright red eruption of flames caused the area to become blinding.*

Ridley: (Blast it! I must put all my Neurons into the shield!-) *He spread his arms and gritted his teeth, causing the cracks in the shield to repair themselves.*

*Ridley looked down with squinted eyes and felt the ground and shield shaking.*

Ridley: *His arms wobbled as he focused on keeping the shield from breaching.* (If I don't keep a consistent level of Astragons, this shield will break! Everything went according to plan, but I could never calculate the magnitude in power!-)

*The vibrations slowed in speed and the brightness dimmed, giving the sense that it was safe.*

Ridley: "Argh-" *He sighed under his breath in accomplishment and dropped to his knees, promptly falling unconscious.*

-

*A purple-black pulse blasted across The Ancient Forest, causing several bird-like Scoldrants in mid-flight to sway to each side in disorientation.*

-

*A purple-black pulse blasted through Eon City, causing a wave of snow to follow it.*

-

*A purple-like pulse blew across the ocean and past Silver Wind Island, causing the Silver Triplets to momentarily appear.*

-

*A purple-like pulse brushed through The Elemental Tower and faded into the air.*

----------

*PKMY, Holland and Lance all slid across a dirt ground, out of a flash of purple light.*

Lance: *He tumbled onto his back and hit the stump of a tree, causing him to grunt in pain.* "Argh-"
Holland: *He rolled across the ground and stopped, causing swirls of dirt to move around him.* "Huh?"
PKMY: *She backflipped along the ground and stopped with ease, noticing a graze mark on the side of her hand.* "Tssk-"

Lance: *He rubbed his head, grunting in frustration.* "Wat happened?"

Holland: "I guess that wasn't supposed to happen, huh?" *He stood on his knees, shaking his head in disorientation.*

PKMY: "No..."

Lance: "Pssht, watch where you're flyin' that thing!"

PKMY: *She frowned with a twitching eye, glaring at Lance.* "First, I don't steer the glyph when it's already prepared, and secondly, they don't fly."

Lance: "Wateva." *He sighed, glancing at the tree behind him.* "Where are we anyways?"

PKMY: *She looked intrigued, observing the tropical and unique forest around her.* "Eh? I don't know where we are, but the area seems familiar."

Holland: *He stood up and looked around, noticing the ground glow around his feet.* "We're in The Twilight Forest."

Lance: "Twilight Forest?"

PKMY: "We've been here before."

Holland: "I thought we were going to Silver Wind Island?"

Lance: *He grunted and stood up, brushing dirt off the side of his shoulder.* "Yea, that's what I thought, aye."

PKMY: "Something knocked us out of the glyph."

Lance: "Huh?"

PKMY: (I don't know much about teleportation glyphs, that's usually Season's department... But, I don't think that should've happened.)

Holland: *He looked up through the trees, noticing it was dark.* "Maybe we should rest here?"

Lance: "Night already." *He looked up, mumbling to himself in surprise.*

PKMY: "I agree with Holly. It wouldn't be smart going through this forest after sunset."

Holland: "Yeah."

Lance: "Fine, wateva." *He grunted and shivered, causing him to hug himself.*

Holland: (Freya, do you know if we can find any Spacial Funnels that have sunlight in them?)

Freya: (Probably, but the trouble going to them wouldn't be worth the trouble.)

Holland: *He nodded his head.* (You're right, good point.)

PKMY: *She looked around in a cautious manner.* (It was already crap and dangerous when the sun was out.)

Lance: "It's dark and I'm cold." *He whined and shivered again, pouting like a child.*

PKMY: "Tssk-" *She rolled her eyes in frustration.*

Holland: *He bent down and placed both hands on the ground.* "Here-"

*Holland closed his eyes and the vegetation around the party glowed different colours, effectively lighting up the area.*

Lance: "Whoa, kool." *He chuckled and spun around in amazement, keeping his arms wrapped around himself.*

Holland: *He opened his eyes and smiled at the glowing environment.* (Awesome.)

PKMY: *She smirked at Holland and shivered herself.* (They're both tired, I can feel it.)

Lance: "But I'm still cold." *He whined, wiggling his bottom in a Millard-like manner.*

Holland: *He stood up and closed his eyes, touching his chest and markings with each hand.* "Come out-"

*An expanding purple glyph spiralled in front of Holland, allowing Freya to jump out of it.*

Freya: "Gruff!" *She landed on the ground, noticing the tribal patterns glow all over her body.*

Lance: "Hey, it's the dumbdog!" *He sounded excited to see her.*

PKMY: (Freya.) *She looked at Freya and leant to one side, folding her arms.*

Freya: "Geroowh." *She glanced at the party, wagging her tail in a happy manner.*

Holland: (Could you help us with a fire?)

Freya: (Of course.) *She raised her head and gargled flames, catching Lance's attention.*

Lance: "Is that-?"

Freya: "Bwarh!-" *She barked out a fireball which exploded on the ground.*

Lance: "Whoa!-" *He jumped back in shock, hitting his head on the tree behind him.* "Ouch!-"

Holland: "Awesome work, Freya." *He stared at the camp-like fire, watching it flicker with a smile.*

Freya: "Gruff!"

Holland: "Alright, let's get some rest." *He mumbled in a deep voice, scratching behind his head.*

PKMY: "Heh, as if I'll listen to you." *She smiled and walked towards the fire, looking at Holland in a competitive manner.* (It better not go out, Holly.)

Freya: *She trotted towards the fire, glancing at PKMY.* (This fire won't go out unless Holland says so, or if he runs out of Neurons.)

PKMY: (Good.) *She stretched and sat next to the fire, crossing her legs.*

Lance: *He slowly walked next to PKMY and rubbed his hands, warming up his body next to the fire.* "Where's the wood to keep the fire goin'?"

Holland: "Freya's got in under control."

Lance: "When could she learn fire? And where has the fleabag been? On a long walk in Fire Hydrant City?"

PKMY: *She rolled her eyes and leant back, lying on the ground.* (What a weirdo.)

Freya: *She trotted next to PKMY and curled up in a ball.* (I know.)

PKMY: (Heh-) *She smirked and looked to her side, staring at Freya.*

Holland: "Ah, Fire Hydrant City?" *He spoke with an awkward chuckle, walking towards the fire.* "I don't think there's a city called-"

Lance: "Oh, don't worry." *He grunted and lay on the ground, rolling onto his side.* "I'm tryin' to get to sleep, aye."

Holland: *He sat on the ground and rested his arms on his knees, staring at the fire in thought.* (Depending on how far in The Twilight Forest we're in, we should be out of here in hours. Luckily my ability to speak to the vegetation has improved...)

*Unusual sounds of creatures which inhabit The Twilight Forest could be heard.*

Holland: (I won't be fooled with all the Spacial Funnels like last time.)

Lance: "Just make sure you don't fail with the teleportin' glyphy next time, shit nugget." *He mumbled, as he slowly fell asleep.*

PKMY: "Shut it, shit face." *She moaned and closed her eyes, adjusting her arms in a more comfortable position.*

Holland: *He smirked, watching PKMY, Freya and Lance slowly fall asleep in a protective manner.* (This place sounds lively-)

*Holland watched shadows dance around the fire and slowly closed his eyes, smiling in a satisfied manner.*

Holland: (I like it..)

----------

*A flash of white light lit up a dark-coloured swampy terrain.*

Alicia: "Eek-" *She landed in a pool of mud, causing her to pull a disgusted look.*

*Frogs and insects could be heard in the background and sounds of popping liquid echoed.*

Alicia: (A swamp? Where am I? This isn't Silver Wind Island.) *She stood up and looked around, holding herself in a vulnerable-like manner.* (This place is scary!)

*Steam evaporated from the mud and insects buzzed through the steam.*

Alicia: *She bit her bottom lip.* (I have to stay the night, or I might accidentally step into quicksand.) *She looked up to a tree and nervously sighed, biting her bottom lip.*

----------

Ridley: *His fingers twitched, as he slowly regained consciousness.* "Hmm?"

*Snow fell around Ridley, causing him to reach out and catch one.*

Ridley: "Snowing?" *He grunted and leant up, looking around in shock.* "This isn't snow.."

*Rocks crumbled from the few pillars which remained standing in Surpreon.*

Ridley: (I feel childish performing such a selfless act-)

*Ridley coughed out smoke and stood up, holding his chest in discomfort.*

Ridley: "The moment I see sunlight-" *He formed a fist and smiled, watching his cuts visibly heal themselves.* "With my new power, I'll create my own warrior system."

*A cloud of thick smog hovered around the destruction, blocking out the stars in the sky.*

Ridley: "I hope Sofia remembers." *He mumbled and looked at the stars in the far distance.* (Now that the seal has been activated, only Sofia and I can comfortably move about.)

*Ridley thought with a widening smile, as his body suddenly puffed away in a pulse of smoke.*

----------

*Sofia slightly squinted her eyes and spread her arms, flying through the night sky.*

Sofia: (I won't forget my love-) *She smirked evil-like and looked over her shoulder, watching her ponytail whip behind her.* (Our Hi-Ougi.)

*Sofia spiralled down and skilfully flew between the spaces of treetops, listening to waves crash in the distance.*

Sofia: "Hahehahe."

Chapter 2: Darkwing Spawns

Celest: (The Imperial Glacial Castle, hope is lost.) *She whispered in thought, trying to hide her sudden sorrow.*

Cassidy: "J-Just let me go down there and find whoever is responsible!" *He grunted in an aggressive manner.*

The Wise: "There is a reason why we don't send our warriors down to the land below."

Cassidy: "Kerk-" *He gritted through his teeth, knowing The Wise wouldn't let him seek revenge.*

Lorilei: "Oh my? And why is that?"

The Wise: "The purity of our Radiatons decreases the longer we're down there."

Lorilei: "My power was fine."

The Wise: "Did you notice the lack of healing abilities you possessed? The slight amnesia of past events?"

Lorilei: "Y-Yes." *She looked surprised as if she kept those conditions hidden.* (And now I can think clearly and recollect my past easier.. But, to be honest, I'd much rather my freedom-)

Cassidy: "So?" *He formed fists, intensely looking at the hooded members of The Wise.* "Thy won't be there for long."

Locki: "This is my fault, thy hesitated when there was a chance to strike him down! Let me go down!"

The Wise: "Thou would have been the best choice to send down, but your emotional state prevents us from doing so."

Locki: *He frowned in disagreement, gritting his teeth.* "Why?!"

The Wise: "Thou could discharge emotionally high bursts of Radiatons and possibly strike down innocents!"

Lorilei: (That has happened before...)

Celest: "Then, what are we going to do?" *She spoke with failure and disappointment.*

The Wise: *She paused and each member faced each other.* "We do not know."

Cassidy: "Then send us down and pursue him!" *He spoke as if the option was clear.*

Locki: "If thou don't know, then we're giving thou an option."

The Wise: "Thou've always been sent down with objectives on what to do, this is different."

Celest: "How?"

Lorilei: (Do they actually sound confused?)

The Wise: "We don't know, the rules are supreme."

Cassidy: "Why aren't we taking action?!"

The Wise: "Thou don't even know who the person at fault is, we will not let thou unjustifiably attack someone."

Celest: (They don't know if they can send us down? They're not making sense!)

Cassidy: *He grunted and folded his arms, causing his wings to flap.* (I honestly have no idea who's at fault, I can see where The Wise is coming from.. I'd be pursuing someone I don't even know-)

Lorilei: "Sofia."

Locki: "Who?"

Lorilei: "Sofia Ripples."

Celest: "She was killed by a powerful Guardian of the Elementalists' city-"

Lorilei: "I cannot explain it, but she's alive."

Locki: (Thy knew thy heard her name being mentioned before, but thy chose to ignore it.. Are these the consequences of my actions? Or should I say, the insufficiency of actions?)

Cassidy: "Thy remember trying to lift her, her entire body was completely made of stone."

The Wise: "It is hard to grasp, but her betrayal and being alive would explain a lot for what's happened."

Locki: "Knowing who it is, let's strike her-"

Lorilei: "Her power is far superior to my own."

Celest: "Thou are a Sacred Knight, how could she be stronger than yourself?"

Lorilei: "I can't explain it."

Locki: "This man was the reason why Pepper was-" *He formed fists and sudden gusts of wind blew around him, catching The Wise's attention.*

The Wise: "Control your anger, Locki!" *Their authority-like voice caused him to calm down.*

Locki: *He relaxed, lowering his head in respect.* "My apologies."

Lorilei: "And unlike us who wear Valhalla's divinity-" *She looked at the party, noticing their holy-like robes and armour.* "She fits in nicely with the land below."

Cassidy: "Saying what?"

Celest: "She could easily hide herself from us."

Lorilei: *She nodded her head in agreement, looking at Cassidy as if Celest was right.* "Exactly."

Cassidy: "Then, what are we going to do?" *He spoke with frustration, as the question has been said several times.*

?????: "Thy will go down and search for Sofia."

The Wise: "We can not allow that-" *A woman materialised in front of the party surrounded in a flash of bright golden light.*

Cassidy: "Who is this woman? Put some clothes on-" *He spoke in disgust, trying not to look at her body.*

The Wise: *She gasped and covered her mouth, glancing at the hooded members around her.* "Bless the Astragons."

Locki: *He looked at the woman in confusion.* (What an unexpected response from a member of The Wise-)

*Each member of The Wise took off their hoods, causing the party to gasp.*

Lorilei: *She watched members of The Wise kneel down to their knees, causing her to look at the woman in shock.* (Why are they bowing?)

The Wise: *She nervously licked her lips.* "It gives us such honour to be in the presence of the, the Valkyrie." *Her words caused the party to gasp.*

Lorilei: (The Valkyrie?) *She froze with widening eyes, suddenly avoiding eye contact with the woman.*

Locki: "Knights.." *He whispered under his breath and dropped to his knees, causing the party to silently follow.*

Valkyrie: "The destruction, the torment of Astragenicons, thy will deal with this myself."

Cassidy: *He started to sweat, noticing his arm shake with emotion.* (Her power isn't anything thy've ever felt before.)

Celest: (Thy don't believe it... In her holy presence...)

Locki: *The Valkyrie's long golden hair caught his attention.* "H-Huh?" *He looked up, mumbling to himself in disbelief.*

Valkyrie: "Lorilei, Cassidy, thou two are to pursue Sofia Ripples!"

Cassidy: "Understood, mistress!"
Lorilei: "We understand, mistress."

Valkyrie: "Celest, induce Aliciana Riseley into a Diareamer sequence."

Celest: "Of course, mistress."

Valkyrie: "Locki, find the Seraph classed as a prodigy."

Locki: "Yes, your mistress."

Valkyrie: "Begone, loyal einherjar!"

Lorilei, Cassidy, Celest and Locki: "Yes, mistress!"

*Cassidy flashstepped out of the area, Lorilei teleported in a flash of purple light while Celest and Locki disappeared in a flash of white light.*

Valkyrie: *She turned around, facing the members of The Wise with a proud face.* "Thou are to explain what has happened in my absence and explain why the land below has become filled with such mayhem."

The Wise: "Yes, mistress!" *Each member spoke at the same time.*

----------

*Sofia flew with her back facing the ocean, admiring the sunrise in the distance.*

Sofia: (Hmm, this is a little boring-) *She spun around and looked ahead, noticing a massive piece of land surrounded by the ocean.* (The Lost Land-)

*Sofia giggled and slowly descended, watching eruptions of white foamy water crash against the edges of the island.*

Sofia: *She suddenly dived down and closely flew above the ocean towards the island, causing a trail of water to follow her.* (I don't see him, maybe I'm late-?)

*Sofia flew above the island and across the grass, causing a burst of water to explode behind her.*

Sofia: *She flew aimlessly across the land and scanned the area in a cautious manner, ignoring her flapping hair.* (I sense something-, it might be him.)

Ridley: *He appeared in a pulse of shadow in the middle of the island, catching Sofia's attention.* "Phew-"

Sofia: *She smiled at the sight of Ridley, causing her to tilt angle towards him.* "Ridley."

Ridley: *He turned around slightly surprised and smirked, watching Sofia fly towards him.* "Ah, Sofia, I'm glad you remembered."

Sofia: *She slowed down and stepped on the grass, causing her wings to disintegrate into nothing.* "Ah, my legs are asleep-" *She whispered to herself as she awkwardly walked up to Ridley with a little speed.*

Ridley: "How are you feeling?"

Sofia: *She stopped and casually raised her hand, pointing a finger behind her.* "I've managed to have them mix perfectly-"

Ridley: "Mixed what?"

Sofia: "The affinities-" *A pulse of black and white gas-like aura evaporated behind her, causing Ridley to nod his head in a proud manner.*

Ridley: "Our dream, it will finally be put in motion-" *He looked to the side, watching the black and white gases fade in the wind.* "Do you remember the plan?"

Sofia: "I do, but there's something I disagree on."

Ridley: "Oh?" *He looked surprised and stared at Sofia, nervously brushing his arm with anticipation.*

Sofia: "Me to rule this continent." *She spoke with low confidence, looking away.*

Ridley: "Oh? I'm shocked to hear you say this."

Sofia: "There is nothing shocking about knowing when you're under levelled.."

Ridley: "Our powers are of equal. Nothing stands a chance against you."

Sofia: "But, that's not it."

Ridley: "Oh, then what is it?"

Sofia: "That I have to rule it.. By myself."

Ridley: *He smiled at Sofia's emotional revelation.* "Once I set order in the land beyond the Spacial Funnel, I will return to see how you've progressed."

Sofia: "You won't be gone for too long?"

Ridley: "I won't." *He shook his head and held Sofia's hand, purposely widening his smile.*

Sofia: "OK." *She spoke with closure, taking a quick breath.* "So, you summoned me here for a specific reason, but you never told me."

Ridley: "Exactly." *He coughed and let go of Sofia's hand, starting to walk in a circle around her.* "I personally believe the warrior system was a fantastic idea."

Sofia: "Hmm." *She nodded her head in a puzzled-like manner and stared ahead, as Ridley walked in her blind spot.*

Ridley: "Well, now that all captains, even the number ones have fallen, the system has essentially crashed."

Sofia: "Yes." *She made eye contact, as Ridley walked back in front of her.*

Ridley: "So, let me ask for your opinion here."

Sofia: "Ridley-" *Her eyes widened in shock.*

Ridley: "What would you like to do with the people who have continuously delayed my plans up until now-?"

Sofia: "Have them all suffer game overs!" *She enthusiastically smirked in an evil-like manner.*

Ridley: "Now then, I believe it's time we used it."

Sofia: *She sighed in excitement, trying to hold her emotions in.* "Y-Yes."

Ridley: *He stood face to face with Sofia and raised his hands.* "Our powers of equality, magnitude, and no bounds of limitation, are you ready?"

Sofia: "This has vanquished my boredom." *She smirked and raised her hands, mimicking Ridley's stance.*

Ridley and Sofia: "Hi-Ougi."

*Darkness consumed the sunrise's light, causing Ridley and Sofia to look serious.*

Ridley and Sofia: "Prayers be heard, threats be preferred-" *An invisible force separated them apart and jelly-like shadows grew in piles around them.*

Ridley: (It's working!)

Ridley and Sofia: "Draw the abyssal scaled features, walk upon our land, dark creatures-"

--

*Dark piles of jelly-like shadow grew in forests, shores, vacant land and around nearby villages.*

--

Ridley and Sofia: "Materialise from ash and carve your dark bones, with your numbers and might we are no longer alone-"

*Bones materialised in the jelly-like shadow, giving the shadows shape.*

Ridley and Sofia: "Add-on incantation, make this our anthem-"

*The bones of shadow took shape of a body and they moved on their own accord, as skeletal wings spread from their sides.*

Ridley and Sofia: "Your colours glow as night, help us in our fight-"

*Two yellow dots for eyes shined in the holes of the creatures' skulls, causing them to stand on two legs.*

Ridley and Sofia: "Have your power sting, DAATHIC FULLSCALE DARKWINGS"

*Three dark creatures materialised and screeched in the air, causing Sofia to bite her lip in excitement.*

--

*Six dark creatures screeched and crawled around the forest they were materialised in.*

--

Ridley: "Darkwings!" *The creatures responded to Ridley's voice.* "Go out and attack the foes which have caused us such grief!"

Darkwing: "Skree!" *They flapped their bones and blasted into the air, leaving trails of smoke-like shadows.*

Sofia: *She watched the area revert back to normal and stared at the Darkwings with a dropping jaw.* "Wow.."

Ridley: "That was the best Ougi-based skill I recall seeing." (It even beats Teresa's Blossom in my opinion.)

Sofia: "They look slightly frightening.. But I know-"

Ridley: "That they'll listen to every word we say?"

Sofia: *She nodded her head with a surprised smile.* "Yes, hahe."

Ridley: "Now that we have support in numbers, it is unlikely we'll have any more interruptions."

Sofia: *She looked to each side, glancing at the vacant land around them.* "Anyone could teleport at any moment, have you done the seal?"

Ridley: "Assuming they even know where we are, I have indeed activated the seal."

Sofia: "What if the seal breaks?"

Ridley: "That will be impossible."

Sofia: "Neh?"

Ridley: "I purposely devised the symbols in the Remenistal to break down only under one condition."

Sofia: "Break down? Time?"

Ridley: "No."

Sofia: "How then?"

Ridley: "I used a similar formula with The Rubistral Moon."

Sofia: "So, what is this one condition?"

Ridley: "Once I die."

Sofia: "You die?" *She whispered in fear, quickly shaking her head with a frown.* "But that's impossible!"

Ridley: "Exactly." *He smiled, causing Sofia to pause in realisation.*

Sofia: "Oh.." *She smiled in relief, looking back up to the Darkwings.*

Ridley: *He noticed Sofia's amazed smile, causing him to look up.* "The same applies for our Hi-Ougi."

Sofia: "Wow, you answered my next question."

Ridley: "So many questions, a little negative?"

Sofia: "N-Not at all." *She smiled with care.* "I just wanted to make sure you won't have any more interference."

Ridley: "Don't fret, all is taken care of." *He chuckled, causing Sofia to giggle in response.*

Sofia: "Yes." *She closed her eyes and slowly inhaled.*

Ridley: "So for now, we must part."

Sofia: "I know." *She spoke under her breath and opened her eyes, looking down in disappointment.*

Ridley: "So, where will you be releasing the swarm?"

Sofia: "I will be releasing more of those creatures hidden in Mount Kingdom Hall."

Ridley: *He looked interested.* "Mount Kingdom Hall? I don't believe I've ever seen it before, where exactly is it?"

Sofia: *She winked and giggled.* "I'd have to show you in person when you get back, because I'm not telling you."

Ridley: "Now you've extinguished my boredom." *He smirked in a sarcastic manner.*

Sofia: "Hahehahe, no matter how much this pains me to say, I should go."

Ridley: "Oh?"

Sofia: "The faster we initiate our plans, the faster I get to see you in the long run."

Ridley: "Alright, you're a sound thinker."

Sofia: *She giggled and sighed, looking up into the sky in a serious manner.* "You'll be creating a powerful Spacial Funnel, right?"

Ridley: "Yes?"

Sofia: "They'll be able to track you, using Surpreon's research facilities."

Ridley: "I don't believe we have to worry about Surpreon any longer."

Sofia: "We don't?"

Ridley: *He shook his head as if he wasn't going to answer.* "So, only people gifted with high sensing abilities, and Silver Wind Island's facilities can sense me. Both of which, are too far away."

*Ridley sighed in a proud manner and looked at Sofia, drawing her attention.*

Sofia: "Goodbye, my love. I'll make sure people receive instant game overs in your honour, no continues."

Ridley: *He stepped forward and kissed her on the lips, leaning back with a happy smile.* "You'd do all that for me? I'm flattered."

Sofia: "Hahe." *She jumped back and faced away, gently touching her lips.* "Send me a sign, letting me know that you've left-"

*Sofia bent forward, causing white and black radiant wings to erupt out from her back.*

Ridley: *He nodded his head in acknowledgement, staring at Sofia's wings which lit up his face.* "Of course!"

Sofia: "Hiyah!" *She jumped up and blasted high into the air, causing a swirl of grass to pulse away.*

Ridley: (Good luck, my love.) *He watched Sofia fly out of his sight, causing him to nervously smile.* (I'm getting that same nervous excitement, the feeling you get before the start of a race..)

Sofia: (I won't disappoint you, Ridley! The only person to ever satisfy my boredom!) *She smiled in thought and licked her lips in determination, flying high above the clouds at amazing speeds.*

Ridley: *He took a deep breath and turned around, mentally preparing himself.* "It will take the whole day to prepare for this Spacial Funnel... This may be an exhausting process."

*Ridley stood up straight and spread his arms far apart, listening to the waves crash in the distance.*

Ridley: (Now, the Spacial Funnel.) *He started to focus, causing the air to warp slightly in front of him.*

----------

*Screeches echoed in the swamp-like terrain, causing Alicia to wake up with a quiet gasp.*

Alicia: "Hmm?" *She moaned and looked down from a leafless tree she slept in.* (What was that-?)

Darkwing: *It screeched and awkwardly walked on two skeletal legs through the mud, staggering into Alicia's sight.* "Sckee-rarh."

Alicia: "Eep-" *She quickly covered her mouth, stopping herself from screaming.*

Darkwing: "Skrarh!?" *It instantly noticed Alicia in the tree, causing it to face her.*

Alicia: *She silently and motionlessly stared at the Darkwing.* (Please go away, weird Scoldrant-)

Darkwing: "Skrarh!" *It sprinted on all fours towards the tree, causing Alicia to squeal.*

Alicia: "No!-"

Darkwing: "Skrarh!" *It slammed its skull into the stump of the tree, causing dead appearing branches to snap off and Alicia to fall out of the tree.*

Alicia: "Oof-" *She hit the damp ground and unintentionally dug her fingers into the dirt, quickly looking up to the Darkwing.*

Darkwing: *It hobbled back in disorientation, watching more dead branches hit the ground.* "Sk-Sk-?"

Alicia: *She stood up and stared at the Darkwing, watching the darkness swirl around its body like mist.* (I've never been in this area before, are these the kind of Scoldrants that inhabit these lands-?)

Darkwing: "Skaerh!" *It stared at Alicia and screeched, facing her in an aggressive manner.*

Alicia: "Ah!" *She turned around without hesitation and started to run away.*

Ridley: (Go out and attack the foes which have caused us such grief!) *His voice echoed in the Darkwing's head.*

Darkwing: *It scraped its feet into the soft dirt, preparing to charge for Alicia.* "Skree!"

Alicia: *Her hair and pendant whipped to each side, as she awkwardly avoided the dead appearing vines and trees.* (I have to ask Holland what that creature was-)

*Alicia squirmed and whimpered, stepping through a thick brown bush.*

Alicia: *She ran out of the bush and sighed in relief, continuing to run away.* (It was so scary looking-)

*Alicia jumped over a large mushroom and gasped, stepping into a differently-coloured pool of mud.*

Alicia: "No-" *Her right leg sunk into ankle-deep mud.* (No! I'm stuck!)

Darkwing: "Skerach!" *Its screeches echoed in the distance, alerting Alicia.*

Alicia: (It sounds even closer now-) *Her leg continued to sink into the mud, causing her to grab it with both hands.*

Darkwing: *It followed Alicia's footprints, cracking sticks under its feet.* "Skree."

Alicia: *She started to panic.* (I have to get out!-)

Darkwing: *It jumped out of the thick brown bush and into a small clearing, instantly glaring at Alicia.* "Sckarh!"

Alicia: *She gasped, staring at the Darkwing with widening eyes.* "No-"

Darkwing: "Skeree!" *It screeched and started to sprint towards her, jumping over the same mushroom into striking distance.*

Alicia: "Ah?!" *She leant down and looked up, watching the Darkwing jump over her.*

Darkwing: *It tried to swipe Alicia with its arms, landing on the mud in front of her.* "Scck-k-k." *It slowly pushed itself closer to Alicia, ignoring its body slowly sinking into the mud.*

Alicia: *Her eyes widened in terror as the Darkwing's arm slowly extended towards her.* "No!"

*Radiant wings erupted from Alicia's back and she blasted up into the air, causing a wave of mud to cover the Darkwing.*

Alicia: *She hovered in the air and looked down, watching bubbles pop from the thick mud.* "I-It's gone-"

*Two more Darkwings with skeletal wings crawled on all fours into the clearing, catching Alicia's attention.*

Alicia: (I don't want to attack innocent Scoldrants, despite how scary looking they are.. I invaded their home, they have the right to attack-)

Darkwing: *They spread their wings and flapped them once, allowing them to jump up in a dive-like manner towards Alicia.* "Schark!"

Alicia: "Huh!?" *She gasped at the Darkwings and quickly looked up, pushing herself higher into the air.*

Darkwing: *It dived into striking distance, reaching towards Alicia's feet.* "Skree-"

Alicia: *She glanced at the Darkwing and lifted her feet, causing the Darkwing to slam into a tree behind her.* (They jump high.)

Darkwing: *It fell back from the tree and flapped its wings, causing it to glide towards Alicia.* "Sk-kerk!"

Alicia: (I think it's time to get out of here.) *She thought with a frightened tone and quickly flew out of the swamp-like terrain.*

Darkwing: "Skeree?" *It flew towards the Darkwing that slammed into the tree and looked up with squinted eyes.*

Alicia: *She flew above brown-coloured treetops, sighing in relief.* (I don't know why I didn't use my wings earlier.. It's like I forget I can use them-)

*The Darkwings screeched, causing Alicia to look behind her.*

Alicia: *She gasped in shock, watching the two Darkwings fly in the air behind her.* (These can fly! But how?! They're not feathered or scaled-)

Darkwing: *It squinted its yellow tiny eyes and its skull cracked, changing its shape.* "Sk-k-k."

Alicia: *She swayed from side to side, continuing to stare behind her at the Darkwings.* (What is it doing?)

Darkwing: *Its skull took shape of a bow and a shard of bone slowly pulled back in its head.* "Schark!"

*A sharp spike of bone blasted past Alicia, causing her to twirl in the air in shock.*

Alicia: "G-Grrh!-" *She looked in front and focused on her flying skills, causing her speed and angle to improve.* (They can attack at long range, I have to seek the nearest village or clearing!-)

----------

*Holland grunted as he adjusted his boots, listening to birds chirp in the forest.*

PKMY: *She tightened a strap to her garments and looked at Lance in an annoyed manner.* "He's still fast asleep."

Holland: "Haha, he always sleeps in. I'm usually up before him."

Lance: *He slept awkwardly with his bottom in the air.* "No, watermelon!"

PKMY: *She rolled her eyes and sighed, walking up to Lance.* "Nuisance-"

Lance: "No, not the pineapple one!"

PKMY: "Tssk-" *She tapped Lance's bottom with her foot in disgust, causing him to tip on the side.*

Lance: "Argh, what, wait, huh?" *He looked around half asleep, rubbing his eyes in a disorientated manner.*

PKMY: "Come on, the sun has risen, let's go."

Lance: "Umm, yea, sure." *He moaned under his breath, standing up with a tired expression on his face.*

Holland: "I closed my eyes and the trees spoke to me-"

PKMY: "What way to Silver Wind Island?" *She spoke as if she knew what Holland was going to say.*

Holland: "We're facing South-" *He turned around and stared into space, nodding his head in a reassuring manner.* "We need to go straight up North and we'll hit Silver Wind Island in no time."

*Holland mumbled in a deep voice, looking at PKMY with a proud smirk.*

Lance: "Kool." *He grunted, stretching his arms and neck.*

PKMY: "Alright, let's go." *She cracked her shoulder and started to walk in the direction Holland faced.*

Lance: "Hey, you gotta know by now not to tell me to hurry up." *He grinned like a child and jogged up to PKMY.*

Holland: *He watched PKMY and Lance jog out of his sight, giving him time to admire the trees and unusual looking plants around him.* (This place always puts a smile on my face-)

Freya: *She glided down from behind and her body shrunk in size, landing on Holland's shoulder.* (I agree.) "Ruff!" *She wagged her tiny tail.*

Holland: *He smirked, scratching his finger on top of Freya's head.* (Let's go-)

PKMY: "Holly!" *She yelled in the distance, catching Holland's attention.*

Holland: *He became alert to PKMY's cries, causing him to instantly run through the forest.* (She sounded worried-)

Freya: *She growled, intensely staring in the direction they ran into.* (I don't sense any yellow-eyed Scoldrants?)

Holland: "Me neither-" (Maybe it's some sort of plant?)

Freya: (Maybe..) *Her ears and tail flapped, as Holland jumped over roots and rocks.*

*PKMY stood with her arms in front in a cautious manner, staring at a bright glowing purple fur-ball which sat on Lance's head.*

Lance: "G-Get this off, I think it's gonna kill me!" *He stood perfectly still, mumbling through the side of his mouth.*

PKMY: "Just shut up, I've heard many stories about the vegetation alone killing warriors all the time."

Lance: "Sh-Shit nuggets-"

Holland: *He ran into the small clearing, staring at PKMY in an urgent manner.* "What-?"

PKMY: "H-Holly." *She whispered, nudging her head to Lance.*

Holland: "Huh?" *He looked at Lance and instantly noticed the purple object, causing the purple ring around his iris to dilate and spiral.*

Freya: "Gruff-" *She jumped off his shoulder and glided through the air as her body grew in size.* (This-)

PKMY: *She looked at Freya with a worried look.* (Is it dangerous? I've never seen one of these things before.)

Freya: (They're perfectly harmless-) *She thought in a confident manner, staring at the Scoldrant in a calm-like manner.*

Lance: "Quickly, I think I feel its evil intent to kill me!"

PKMY: "Heh." *She smirked and relaxed, lowering her arms in a casual manner.*

Lance: "Why are ya chucklin', it's gonna kill me!"

Holland: "You're fine, Lance."

PKMY: *She leant to one side and folded her arms, staring at Holland.* "What is it then?"

Holland: "Wow-" *He mumbled in amazement as if he realised what the Scoldrant was.*

PKMY: "Holly?"

Holland: *He walked towards Lance, keeping a fixated stare on the glowing fur-ball.* "I've heard of these little guys back when I was a kid."

PKMY: "So, that was a few hours ago?"

Holland: "Haha."

Lance: "Wat's goin' on?! Just get it off already!"

PKMY: "Wat are they?"

Holland: "Tales say, balls of glowing fur lead lost travellers the way to civilisation."

PKMY: (Wild Scoldrants helping humans in such a manner?) *She looked intrigued, paying closer attention to Holland's story.*

Holland: "Others believe, it's a will of good fortune. These Scoldrants are so rare, I'm excited to see one for the first time." *He spoke with amazement, causing PKMY to smirk.*

Freya: (I sense healing properties from it too.)

PKMY: (Wow.) *She thought in an impressed-like manner, glancing at Freya.*

Holland: *He stood next to Lance and reached out, causing the glowing purple ball to float off Lance's head.* "Over here, little girl."

Lance: "Phew-"

Scoldrant: "Yeup." *She flew onto Holland's hand, frizzing her fur up.*

Lance: "Aye?" *He quickly brushed his hair, ensuring it was dry.*

PKMY: (I know Holly can understand it-) "What's she saying?"

Holland: "I'm not sure, she's not making sense."

Lance: "So, you can't understand her? I thought you were the dog whisperer."

Holland: "No, I can.. It's just her words are meddled up-" *He raised the Scoldrant to his face and squinted his eyes.* "She seems really tired, let's take her back home."

Lance: *He sighed like a child.* "So, we're off on another quest?"

Freya: (I'm not sure where, but her scent is clustered up ahead.)

Holland: *He nodded his head to Freya and looked at Lance.* "No, her home is on the way."

Lance: "Good-" *He frowned, folding his arms like a child.*

PKMY: "Wat will we be looking for?"

Holland: "They are said to live in human-sized flowers, others of the same species also favour branches of trees to assist in their ability to fly.."

Lance: "OK." *He impatiently grunted and turned away, hinting for the party to move on.*

Freya: "Ruff." *She barked at Lance in agreement, causing the party to slowly walk forward.*

Lance: "I gotta admit, this forest does look pretty wicked." *He spun around in amazement.*

Freya: "Gruff!" *She barked in agreement, causing Lance to cockily nod his head as if he could understand her bark.*

Lance: (But, still not as good as Valhalla.)

PKMY: (Heh.) *She smirked at Lance as if she heard what he thought.*

Scoldrant: "Yeup." *She glowed in Holland's hand, causing PKMY to stare at her.*

PKMY: "Why did you seem so impressed to see her?"

Holland: "Well, rumours or not, it's great to have a little sign of good luck, right?" *He spoke in a deep voice, smirking at the purple fur-ball in his palm.*

PKMY: "I suppose."

Lance: "Well, at least a human-size flower won't be hard to miss, aye."

Holland: "They say that the nectar of the flower is said to heal depression itself."

Lance: "Bull-, crap." *He placed his hands on the back of his head, looking unconvinced.*

PKMY: "It's just a tale, don't get too excited, dickhead."

Lance: "Wateva."

Freya: She took several steps forward, sniffing the air in front of her.* (Rumours also say, that the Scoldrants collect the happiness they receive from the travellers they rescue and somehow store it in their home.)

PKMY: (Interesting.)

Lance: "So, how far have we got to walk now?"

PKMY: "We only just started walking-"

Scoldrant: *She glowed brighter and floated into the air, catching Holland's attention.* "Yeu yeu yeup."

Holland: *He glanced at the Scoldrant, causing him to look ahead in excitement.* "I think it's past the wall of bushes."

Freya: *The purple ring around her iris spiralled and her tribal patterns glowed.* (I don't sense anything-?)

Holland: "I can't hold it in-" *He ran past the party and jumped through the bushes in excitement.* (I can't wait to see this place that apparently lifts emotions!)

Scoldrant: "Yeup!" *She hovered in the air, staring at the bushes in confusion.*

Lance: *He looked at PKMY as if he wanted to chase after Holland.* "..."

PKMY: *She rolled her eyes and sighed, waving Lance away.* "Well, go on then-"

*PKMY paused with widening eyes and looked shocked, staring into space with a dropping jaw.*

PKMY: "H-Huh?"

Freya: "Ohwhoo-" *She whimpered and suddenly sprinted past the party, pouncing into the bushes after Holland.*

Lance: "It's not like I needed your permission, aye-" *He prepared to run and noticed PKMY's strange face, causing him to stop.* "Wat is it?"

PKMY: "Come on.." *She spoke in a low, confused tone, causing Lance to look intrigued.*

Lance: "Aye?"

PKMY: "I felt a strong surge of emotion from Holly."

Lance: "Maybe it was excite-?"

PKMY: "It wasn't a happy feeling-" *She sounded worried and ran towards the bushes.*

Lance: "Wait for me!" *He grunted and quickly ran, closely following PKMY.*

*PKMY and Lance jumped through the bushes and noticed Holland and Freya, standing on the spot in shock.*

Lance: "Whoa-" *He slowly stepped forward, observing his surroundings in shock.*

PKMY: "W-What happened...?" *She mumbled softly as sunlight shined brightly on the ground.*

Holland: "..." *He slowly shook his head, silently choking in disbelief.*

Lance: "Trees were covered in charcoal and the ground was burnt to ash. Sunlight shined through, as the leaves were burnt away..."

PKMY: ".. Lance.."

Freya: *She whimpered at the destruction in front of her, curling her tail in between her legs.* "..."

Scoldrant: *She floated over the bushes and her blue glow dimmed.* "Yeu..." *Her tone was low, as it symbolised how upset she was.*

Lance: *He observed a burnt down tree next to him.* "A natural fire?"

Holland: *He stood quietly, staring at the burn marks with a sad filled face.* "..."

PKMY: "H-Holly-" *She stepped forward and heard a crunch, causing her to look down in confusion.* "Eh?"

Lance: *He glanced to the side and looked under PKMY's foot.* "Hey, it's one of them fur-ball Scoldrants-"

PKMY: *She quickly stepped back, staring at the charcoaled ground in a guilty manner.* (These burns aren't caused by fire or lightning Rostical-)

Scoldrant: ".. Yeu..." *She hovered in the air, unsure what to do.*

PKMY: (If it wasn't natural or Rostical, what caused these-?) *A beat pulsed through her body, causing her to glance at Holland with a strange look.*

Holland: *He formed fists and started to breathe heavily.* "..."

*Screeches echoed from a line of smoke, which could be seen in the sky.*

Holland: "This was not natural." *He spoke in an abnormally calm tone, catching Lance's attention.*

PKMY: "Holly-"

Holland: "Amy, please.."

PKMY: (There is so much anger coming from him.)

Lance: *He looked around uncomfortable and stared at Holland in determination.* "I wanna help!"

Holland: "H-Huh?" *He looked over his shoulder at Lance in shock.*

Lance: "Wateva pissed you off, I wanna help!"

Holland: *He nodded his head, trying to contain his anger.* "Freya!"

Freya: *She leapt in front of Holland and sniffed the air.* (This way!-) *She shouted in thought, sprinting through the burnt area of forest.*

Holland: "Let's go!"

*Holland, PKMY and Lance chased after Freya who led the party towards the screeches.*

Darkwing: *It stood in fire and staggered towards a nearby tree.* "Schkreee!" *It screeched and jabbed its skeletal arms into the tree, causing the stump to ignite in fire.*

Holland: "You!" *He roared with anger, instantly catching the attention of six Darkwings.*

Lance: *He ran next to Holland and puffed to catch his breath.* "Gah-" *He stood up straight and looked at the closest Darkwing in confusion.* "Wat kind of Scoldrant is that?"

PKMY: "Holly, I sense anger, I want to remind you, that you'd never maliciously hurt a Scoldrant even if it's contaminated with the yellow-eyed-"

Holland: "These are no Scoldrants!"

Lance: "A-Aye?" *He sounded shocked.*

PKMY: "If they're not Scoldrants, then wat are they?"

Holland: "I can't explain it, but they're not Scoldrants. I'm one hundred percent positive."

PKMY: "Heh, that's all I needed to know." *She smirked and bent forward, standing in a battle-ready pose.*

Lance: "R-Right-" *He reached out and lightning formed into a sword in between his fingers.*

Holland: "Let's go!" *He angrily charged towards the closest Darkwing and pumped himself up, causing his arm muscles to bulge.*

Freya: *She sprinted on all fours directly behind Holland.* (I'm right behind you!-)

Darkwing: *It screeched and ripped its arms out of the tree, glancing at Holland.* "Skr-"

Holland: "Garh-" *He slid on the ground and formed a tight fist, bracing himself.*

Darkwing: *It watched Holland slide into striking distance, causing it to raise its arms in an offensive-like manner.* "Skree-"

Holland: "Harh!" *He suddenly uppercut the Darkwing into the air and raised his arm, watching shadow swirl around his fist.*

PKMY: (Strong!-)

Freya: *She pounced onto Holland's arm from behind and jumped into the air.* (Sonic Roar.) *She barked out a visible shockwave, hitting the Darkwing in mid-air.*

Darkwing: *Its shadow blew back caused by the shockwave.* "Scheek-"

Holland: (Direct hit!) *He cracked his knuckles, looking up with an anger filled smile.*

Freya: *She flapped her wings, which extended from her sides and she flew above the Darkwing.* (Aerial Pounce.) *She flashstepped on top of the Darkwing and jumped off, causing the Darkwing to slam into the ground.*

Darkwing: "Sk-orh-" *Shards of bone splintered around it, as dirt erupted into the air.*

Holland: *He grunted in anger, staring at the dirt cloud with gritted teeth.* "It was strong."

Freya: *She glided down, landing next to Holland with ease.* (I felt bones crush under my paws.)

Holland: (Despite sensing nothing from those creatures, I know it's dead-)

Lance: "Harh!" *He ran towards a nearby Darkwing, catching its attention.*

Darkwing: "Skree!" *It squinted its eyes and charged towards Lance, extending its nails to the size of daggers.*

Lance: (Damn these are freaky lookin' things-)

Darkwing: *It ran into striking distance and screeched, raising its arms with killing intent.* "Sckrah!" *It slashed across Lance's lightning sword, causing it to screech louder.*

Lance: *He glanced at the lightning, unsure what happened.* "Huh-?" (Its arm went through my lightnin'? It must be an Astragong thingo!-)

Darkwing: *It slightly stepped back in shock.* "Sk-k-k."

Lance: *He noticed the Darkwing's bones slice in half due to the lightning, causing him to smirk.* "Ha."

Darkwing: "Skrarh!" *Sounds of bones cracking could be heard, as another skeletal arm shot out.*

Lance: (It just restored the damaged bones!-)

Darkwing: *It raised its arm and focused all its attention on moving its fingers as if it was the first time healing itself.* "Sk-kree-"

Lance: "Wateva-" *He leant forward and slashed the air with the lightning, readying himself.*

Darkwing: *It noticed the lightning move, causing it to instantly look at Lance.* "Skra-"

Lance: "Harh!" *He jumped forward and took large steps towards the Darkwing, continuously slashing the lightning at the Darkwing.*

Darkwing: *It rolled to each side as it unnaturally moved to avoid his attacks.* "Sk-k-kree."

Lance: (Stop movin'!) *He frowned, watching the Darkwing's shadow light up each time he slashed the lightning close to it.*

Darkwing: "Skree!" *It rolled back and slashed across Lance's lightning sword, causing several of its fingers to crack off.*

Lance: *He jabbed the lightning forward, extending its length to hit the Darkwing.* (It's like it's double jointed or somethin'-)

Darkwing: *It unnaturally rolled to the side and pounced towards Lance, spreading its dagger-like nails.* "Skeree-"

Lance: "Hmph-" *He stood straight and raised his arm, causing the lightning to scatter and flash away.*

Darkwing: "Skree!" *It lunged into striking distance, jabbing its nails towards Lance's face.*

Lance: "MAGNETIC RUMBLE" *A white shield expanded from his arm and reflected the Darkwing back into the air.*

Darkwing: "Skrark-" *It screeched in shock and hit the ground, tumbling back in anger.*

Lance: "Air Slash." *He raised his arm, watching lightning stream and spark above him.*

Darkwing: *It violently stood on all fours, surrounded by swirls of dirt.* "Skerh." *It opened its jaw at Lance, causing drool-like shadows to ooze out.*

PKMY: *She sprinted towards two Darkwings with her arms swaying behind her back.* "Harh." *She jumped high into the air and spiralled downwards, catching the two Darkwing's attention.*

*The Darkwings rocked back and forth, as they were unable to read the flow of PKMY's movements.*

PKMY: *She spread her arms and landed, spiralling with her legs above her head.* "Harh!"

Darkwing: *It tried to jab downwards at PKMY, watching her spiral around its arm.* "Skerah?"

PKMY: "Harh!" *She spiralled across the ground, violently kicking the Darkwing to her right into the air.*

*PKMY used the spiralling momentum to backflip towards the Darking on her left.*

PKMY: "Swift might, at my command, AIR SWIRL"

Darkwing: *It watched PKMY flip towards it before a green swirl of wind hit it into the air.* "Ske-?" *It glanced down in disorientation and watched PKMY continue to flip directly under it.*

PKMY: *She stood on her hands and smirked.* "Heh." *She watched the Darkwing descend.*

Darkwing: *It spread its arms and readied to attack PKMY.* "Skrarh-"

PKMY: "Hah!" *She kicked downwards and slammed the Darkwing onto the ground.* "AIR SWIRL"

*A green glyph flashed under PKMY's feet and another gust of green wind knocked the Darkwing back into the air.*

Darkwing: *It screeched in confusion, watching its finger snap off its hands.* "Skree?" *It glanced at the other Darkwing PKMY knocked into the air.*

*PKM Y looked up and stared at the two airborne Darkwings, causing her to smirk in confidence.*

PKMY: *She ran forward and jumped in the middle of the Darkwings.* "This is for Holly!-"

*The Darkwings screeched in shock, staring at PKMY in the air in between them.*

PKMY: *She waved her arms and spun at a high speed, watching the Darkwings move in slow motion.* "Ha!"

*PKMY quickly kicked the Darkwing to her right and pointed at the Darkwing to her left, watching the air ripple around her hand.*

Darkwing: *It watched the Darkwing behind PKMY shatter into a cloud of bones.* "Kaerh-?"

PKMY: *She frowned and pushed forward, causing a shockwave to explode the Darkwing away.* "Yahoo-" *She descended and spiralled in the air, landing on the ground with ease.*

*PKMY smirked, watching a shower of bones hit the ground around her.*

PKMY: "Too easy-" *She listened to the sounds of hollow wood come from the falling bones.* "Not even worth the warm-up."

Darkwing: *It stared at PKMY from behind and screeched at its falling comrades.* "Sk-kreeh!"

PKMY: "Heh." *She looked over her shoulder and stared at the Darkwing with a smirk, as streams of dust rained around her.*

Lance: "Harh!" *He slashed the lightning downwards, causing a visible air slash to slice through the Darkwing.*

Darkwing: "K-K-Kerh-?" *It paused, watching a wave of its darkness blow back in the air slash.*

Lance: *He watched the black air slash hit the ground, exploding charcoal into the air.* "Gotcha-"

Darkwing: "Skree!" *It shook its skull and shuffled towards Lance, as if nothing happened.*

Lance: (It didn't work?!) *He took several steps back in shock, pointing the lightning sword at the Darkwing.*

Darkwing: *Its small yellow eyes squinted, focusing all its attention to Lance.* "Skerh?"

Lance: *He grunted and straightened his arm at the Darkwing.* "I don't know how you survived that air slice goin' through ya body, but-"

Darkwing: *It staggered into striking distance and extended its dagger-like nails, readying to pounce Lance.* "Skreeh!"

Lance: "You're gone! Smear upon the skies, blue waves crashing down-"

*A yellow glyph shined under Lance and the Darkwing suddenly sliced in half, causing him to pause in confusion.*

Lance: "Aye?" *He slowly lowered his arm, causing the lightning sword to separate and spark into nothing.*

Darkwing: "Skrah-" *Its body suddenly puffed into dust, causing Lance to look at it in disgust.*

Holland: *He looked to the side and watched the fire travel up the tree, causing him to gasp in anger.* "Freya!"

Freya: "Ruff." *She pounced forward and raised her snout, gargling water.* (Gargling Whirlpool.) *She aimed towards the fire and leant forward, barking out a vortex of water.*

Holland: *Sounds of steam hissed around the tree as the water extinguished the flames.* "Great-"

Darkwing: *It flew above the party and screeched.* "Kreeee."

Lance: *He looked up, pointing in the air with a dropping jaw.* "They can fly!"

PKMY: "Really?"

Lance: "Shuddup." *He clicked his fingers, causing a stream of lightning to form into a sword.*

PKMY: "Wateva." *She looked at the lightning in Lance's hand, causing her to discreetly grunt in amazement.*

Lance: "Pssht.." *He held the lightning with both hands, causing the lightning to thicken.*

Holland: *He angrily ran next to Lance and looked up.* (They will pay for this destruction!) "Freya and I will take the one in the air, you get the other two."

Lance: (Other two?) *He looked around and shook his head, raising an eyebrow in confusion.* (There's no sign of any of them skeletal thingys left?)

Freya: *She glanced at Holland and nodded her head, knowing what Holland wanted.* "Gruff-"

Holland: *He looked up, watching the Darkwing fly out of his sight.* "Damn it."

Freya: (Go-) *She lined herself up with Holland and flapped her wings with a growing body.*

Holland: *He started to run and jumped up, watching Freya swoop under him.* "Let's get it!"

*Holland grunted in anger, riding Freya above the treetops.*

Freya: (Yes!) *She growled in anger and flapped her wings, causing the treetops to bend back.*

PKMY: *She looked around in suspense, shuffling closer to Lance.* "Watch your back."

Lance: "I don't see anythin', aye?"

PKMY: "I trust him."

Lance: "I guess-"

*Screeches echoed hidden from the surrounding forest, catching Lance and PKMY's attention.*

PKMY: "Take care of Holly, I'll get them both."

Lance: "Huh? As if I'll let you take 'em on by yourself-"

PKMY: *She ran towards the screeches and flashstepped, causing a swirl of dirt and charcoal to spiral away.* (I'll never say this to you, but I'll always be by your side too, Holly-)

*Two Darkwings hid behind a thick tree, staring at Lance in the distance.*

Lance: *He looked around the vacant area and sighed in frustration.* (Fine.. I'll help Holland then-)

*Lance faced the direction Freya flew into and started to run towards it, keeping his focus in the sky.*

PKMY: *She flashstepped behind the Darkwings and placed her hands on her sides, watching dirt blow to one side.* "How dare you, filthy scum-"

*The Darkwings screeched in fright and quickly turned around to face PKMY.*

PKMY: *She stared at the ground with an emotionless face, as sparks scattered past her face.* "Out of my sight."

Darkwing: "Skrah-?"

PKMY: *She threw each of the Ryukku into their skulls, cracking the bone around the blades.* "Tssk-"

*The Darkwings stood motionless, looking up to the Ryukku in their skulls.*

PKMY: "I don't often tell people this, but I enjoy fights." *She violently grabbed the Ryukkus' handles and ripped out them out, causing shards of bone to crumble away.*

Darkwing: *It stepped to the side and head-butted the other Darkwing.* "Sk-kk."

PKMY: "But seeing Holly, one of my friends, so angry-" *She shook her head and started to walk away.* "It wasn't even fun-"

*The Darkwing's bodies suddenly puffed into dust, leaving no trace of their existence.*

*Lance ran into another clearing with his lightning sword raised in an offensive manner.*

Darkwing: *It screeched in shocked confusion as Holland and Freya flew above it.* "Skree?!" *It looked behind it, trying to see what the wind was.*

Freya: *She flew higher into the air, watching her fur sway in the wind.* (It didn't even see us.)

Holland: (Good..)

Lance: *He looked up into the air and noticed Holland high in the sky, causing him to lower his arm.* (How am I meant to help now?)

*The lightning in Lance's hand dimmed and stopped its fluid-like stream, causing it to slowly spark into nothing.*

Holland: *He looked directly down and glared at the Darkwing, nodding his head.* "Freya, now!"

Freya: (This is reckless-)

Holland: (Just do it!-)

Freya: (Okay-) *She growled in frustration and spun around, flicking Holland downwards with her wing.*

Lance: "Holy shit!-" *He stepped forward, intensely staring at Holland with widening eyes.*

Holland: *He dived downwards at an incredible speed, tilting his head towards the Darkwing.* (Let's see if it can survive this-)

Freya: (Tangrowth Slash.) *Her nails extended like vines and they slithered past Holland, jabbing into the Darkwing.*

Darkwing: "Schrek!"

Holland: *He smirked, watching the vines wave around him.* "Humph-"

Freya: (Ice Fang.) *Her teeth shined a fluoro blue and two streams zigzagged downwards, biting into the Darkwing.*

Darkwing: "Skree!" *It screeched, trying to break free from Freya's grasp.*

Lance: (Fleabag's got the thingy trapped in the air!-)

Holland: *He squinted his eyes and frowned in determination, forming a fist.* "Harh!" *He dived past the Darkwing and punched it across the head, causing its bones to shatter around his fist.*

Freya: *The Darkwing shattered to pieces and puffed into dust, causing her nails to sway in the wind.* "..."

Lance: *He noticed Holland falling directly towards the ground.* "Oi, Holland!-" *He stepped forward in shock.*

Holland: "..." *He reached towards the ground and Fryfry suddenly swarmed along the ground.*

Fryfry: (Myrror Shield.)

Lance: (Huh?) *He looked over his shoulder and noticed a red glyph, which rotated in the air behind him.*

*The fireflies crossed paths and formed a glass-like reflective shield under Holland.*

Holland: "Erh-" *He hit the shield and bounced back, as the shield shattered like glass.*

Fryfry: "Bzzzst." *They swarmed towards Holland, ensuring he was okay.*

Holland: *He landed on the ground and stood up, puffing out his chest with a sigh.*

Freya: *She dived down and swooped next to Holland, shrinking in body size.* (That was reckless!)

Lance: "Hey, that wasn't kool." *He grunted with a worried frown, walking up to Holland and Freya.*

Holland: *He took deep breaths, trying to calm himself down.* "I.. Ah.." *He regretfully scratched the back of his head, nodding his head at Fryfry.*

Fryfry: "Bzzz-" *They spiralled up, disintegrating into the air.*

PKMY: *She flashstepped next to Holland, instantly punching him on the shoulder.* "Holly, you stupid ogre."

Holland: *He looked down to PKMY, noticing her emotional face.* "I'm, ah, really sorry-"

Freya: (Holland-)

Lance: "So wat was all that about?" *He hissed under his breath, staring at Holland for his response.*

Holland: *He paused, looking down to his feet.* "I'm a lot of things, but I'm not an angry person-"

PKMY: "You were passionate about this forest."

Lance: "Yea, we're only human. We make mistakes." *He shrugged his shoulders.*

Holland: *He glanced at PKMY and Lance in confusion.* "Aren't you three disappointed in me?"

Lance: "Whoa, I lose my kool all the time, aye. So now it's my turn to pat you on the shoulder and be all awesome 'n' stuff-" *He smiled, placing his hand on Holland's shoulder in a brotherly manner.*

PKMY: "Heh."

Lance: "I'm awesome, you're awesome, we're all awesome."

PKMY: "Besides, Freya and I wouldn't like some pushover guy."

Freya: "Gruff!"

Holland: "A push over guy?" *He mumbled in confusion.*

PKMY: "Yea, when someone sees something they care about getting damaged or hurt-" *She observed the damaged forest around her, looking back to Holland.* "-And doing nothing about it."

Freya: "Ruff!" *She barked in agreement.*

Lance: "Yea, never stand back and watch the things you care about get hurt, aye."

Holland: "Haha, thanks you three." *He placed his hand on Lance's and smirked at PKMY.*

Scoldrant: *She drifted over the party and positioned herself in the midst of the burnt vegetation.* "Yeup."

Lance: *He stepped back and shuffled to the side, pointing at the Scoldrant like a child.* "Look, it's that fur-ball thing that tried to kill me."

Holland: "Haha-"

Lance: "Oi, no funnies, I'm serious."

Scoldrant: "Yeup!" *She brightly shined purple and the vegetation around her lost its charcoal and turned green.*

Freya: "Howhooh?"

Holland: *He smirked in amazement.* "Wow."

Lance: (Whoa, it's getting rid of the burnt stuff.) *He nodded his head in disbelief.* "How's it doin' that?"

PKMY: "It's restoring the forest by pouring rich Neurons into the ground.. Amazing."

Lance: "Kool."

Holland: "She must be the restorative type of her species."

Lance: "Had no idea." *He pouted and looked at Holland like he was an idiot.*

PKMY: *She gasped and quickly looked away, staring into the distance.* (What is that?)

Holland: "What's wrong?"

Lance: *He looked at PKMY, raising an eyebrow in confusion.* "Seekin' attention?"

PKMY: "No, try hard from Fire Hydrant City, I sense Season."

Lance: "Season." *He sounded excited and looked around.* "What's he doin' in the forest?"

Holland: "Amy?"

PKMY: (Whereabouts?) *She mumbled in thought and scanned the area as if she was seeing into the distance.*

Freya: *She sniffed several times, looking at PKMY.* (He's outside the forest.)

Holland: *He flared his nose, nodding his head in agreement.* (Silver Wind Island.)

Lance: *He watched the party awkwardly look at each other, grunting in confusion.* "Aye? So like what? Season's hidin' in a bush somewhere-?"

PKMY: (We'll have to see him then.) *Holland and Freya nodded their heads, as they all walked past Lance.*

Lance: "Umm, hi? My name's Lance, ya know, I kinda asked you lot a question?!" *He swayed his arms like a child, watching the party walk away.*

PKMY: "Don't drag us behind!" *She yelled out to Lance, causing him to stamp his foot like a child.*

Holland: (I wanted to watch the Scoldrant replenish this damage, but, I got to set my priorities.)

Lance: "Drag you behind!? Don't make me laugh!" *He ran after the party, as they started to jog away from Lance.* "Oi! Don't run away from me!"

----------

*A path of water waved behind Alicia, as she flew above the ocean.*

Alicia: (They still haven't given up!)

*The path of water splashed in between the two Darkwings, as they closely pursued Alicia.*

Alicia: "A-Ah-" *She spiralled in the air, as two shard-like bones fiercely shot past her.*

*The two Darkwings screeched, as another shard-like bone eroded from their bow-like skulls.*

Alicia: (I'm getting tired-) *She looked ahead and slightly smiled in relief, noticing an island surrounded by a silver tornado.* (Silver Wind Island!-)

Darkwing: "Skreerh!" *It shot out another shard-like bone.*

Alicia: *She flicked her feet and moved out of the way, waiting for the shard to fly past her.* "Where did it-?" *She gasped in shock, watching the bone slice through her hair.* "Ah!"

Darkwing: "Sk-k-ker." *It croaked to the Darkwing next to it, causing them to separate from each other.*

Alicia: *She glanced behind her and focused her attention back in front, biting her bottom lip.* (They are planning something-)

Darkwing: "Skee." *It flapped several times and ascended up into the air.*

Alicia: (If I get close enough to Silver Wind Island-)

Darkwing: "Sk-k-krouf!" *It screeched and flew into the ocean, causing an eruption of waves to catch Alicia's attention.*

Alicia: "Huh?" *She looked behind her, staring at the waves in shock.* (Did it dive into the water?!)

Darkwing: "..." *It silently flew above Alicia.*

Alicia: *She looked ahead and continued to fly closer to the island, noticing a cliff's formation to her left.* (Nearly there-)

Darkwing: *It shot out from the ocean directly under Alicia, violently grabbing onto her leg.* "Skiiiarhh."

Alicia: "Argh!-" *Her flying speed slowed down, as the Darkwing purposely thrashed itself on her leg.* (It's heavy!-)

*Alicia squealed in thought and her wings moved like razor blades, suddenly blasting herself high into the air.*

Darkwing: *It tightened its grip around Alicia's leg, attaching itself onto her body.* "Kergh-"

Alicia: (Its grip hurts-)

Darkwing: "Sk-Skeree." *It screeched in an eerie-like manner, slowly crawling along Alicia's body like a spider.*

Alicia: *She waved her arm back filled with fear, trying to knock the Darkwing off her body.* (I can't-)

Darkwing: *It quickly avoided her hits and positioned itself around her wings, before latching itself on her back.* "Skeee."

Alicia: "G-Go away-"

Darkwing: *A cluster of jelly-like shadow grew around its ribs.* "Skree-"

Alicia: (I have to get it-) *She whimpered with fear, before taking a deep breath of courage.* "ICICLE EDGE-"

Darkwing: *Four arms shot out of its ribs, violently grabbing hold of Alicia's wrists and ankles.* "Skerh!"

Alicia: "N-No!-"

Darkwing: "Skerah!" *It used its strength and flipped Alicia over so she faced the sky.*

Alicia: *She stared at the sky, trying to break free.* "W-What are you doing-?"

Darkwing: *It flapped in the air and looked down below, noticing Alicia's vulnerability.* "Sk-kark-kark." *It straightened its body and its bones cracked, forming itself into a spear.*

Alicia: *She stopped struggling and noticed the spear-like Darkwing above her.* "W-What-?" *Her eyes widened in fear.* (No-)

Darkwing: "Kerh-" *It aimed for Alicia's head, listening to its bones crack in position.*

Alicia: "I can't stop it in time!-"

Darkwing: "Skree!" *It screeched with killing intent, blasting itself towards Alicia.*

?????: "Endure the piercing sounds, hurricanes might, ball of force, FLURRY STYX" *A ball of wind shot itself from the nearby land and towards Alicia, whooshing the air around it.*

Alicia: "G-Get away from me!-" *She wheezed as the ball of wind hit her back, exploding the Darkwing off.*

Darkwing: "Skrah-" *It watched its arms shatter away in the wind and stared at Alicia's back, before falling into the ocean.*

?????: "CRESCENT VOLT HOOK"

Alicia: "No!" *She watched the spear-like Darkwing dive towards her face, shaking her head in terror.*

*A powerful blast of purple lightning instantly zapped through the spear-like Darkwing in front of Alicia.*

Alicia: "Eek!-" *She squinted her eyes, watching the lightning flash through the Darkwing's skull.*

Darkwing: "Sk-ergh-" *It slowed down with a loss of momentum, suddenly puffing into dust.*

Alicia: *She squinted her eyes, as a spear of dust brushed past her and into the ocean below.* "What-?" *She whispered to herself and positioned herself upright, floating in the air in shock.*

?????: "Alicia!" *A man's voice echoed from the land, catching her attention.*

Alicia: "H-Huh?" *She spun around and stared at the island, trying to see if she could see someone.* (That voice-)

?????: "Oh bless ya!" *A woman's voice echoed with a slight groan from the land, causing Alicia to frown in uncertainty.*

Alicia: *She looked determined and leant forward, blasting through the air towards the voices.* (They are-)

*A dozen Darkwings surrounded Chrisma, Joy, Season, Cameron and Tyler, all screeching in battle-ready poses.*

Cameron: *He pointed his blue glyphic sword at three Darkwings.* (This situation could not be any worse-)

*Cameron looked behind him and glanced at Joy and Tyler who were lying on the ground unconscious.*

Chrisma: *She reached over Tyler and Joy, watching two sets of white rings slowly heal them.* (I'm too tired-) *She struggled to hold her head up, causing the ring's light to flicker.*

Darkwing: "Skree." *It swayed to each side in an aggressive manner, staring at the light caused by Chrisma.*

Season: "Cameron, take down the creatures that bypass my Rostical!" *He shouted and swayed his trident, emphasising his stress.*

Cameron: *He raised his sword in concentration, staring at the Darkwings in a patient manner.* "Affirmative."

Season: *He raised the trident with both hands and closed his eyes.* "Defensive winds, swirl and soar, offensive gusts, grand winds blow throughout my spirit-"

*A massive green glyph formed itself under the party, catching Cameron's attention.*

Season: "Tunnel its power through the almighty clouds and pierce anything that stands in its way-"

Chrisma: *She grunted in fatigue, ignoring green glyphic symbols which spiralled around the party.* "Whoup-" *She sighed in exhaustion and collapsed on top of Tyler, instantly falling unconscious.*

Cameron: *He cautiously looked to each side, watching a swirl of wind circle around the party.* (Grand Remenistal!-)

Season: "DIVINE TORNADO"

*A swirl of wind blasted all the Darkwings up high into the air, causing Cameron to slightly lower the sword.*

Season: (Great-) *He looked up into the eye of the tornado and vaguely noticed balls of shadow in the wind, counting them with his lips.* (One, two, three-)

Cameron: (Hmm-) *He glanced at the wall of wind, waiting for Season's instructions.*

Season: *He quickly looked at Cameron.* "I just counted eleven!"

Apollo: (Stay vigilant! There were twelve!) *His squarks echoed in Cameron's thoughts.*

Cameron: *He looked at Season in confusion, shaking his head.* "Then one has-"

Darkwing: *It shot itself through the tornado and screeched at Season with its nails extending towards his face.* "K-K-Kee?"

Season: "I'm temporarily frozen due to the Neurons being released for the Rostical!-"

Cameron: "Say no more!-" *His image instantly appeared in front of the Darkwing.*

Darkwing: "Sk-?!" *It dug its feet into the dirt, causing it to instantly stop in response to Cameron's sudden appearance.*

Cameron: "Force of power-" *Glyphic rings formed around his sword and he flashstepped into the air before the Darkwing reacted to his image.*

Darkwing: "Skree?!" *It looked around in confusion, unsure what just happened.*

Cameron: *The glyphs around his sword grew in size and he pointed the sword downwards to the Darkwing.* "Thunder Boom."

*The rings slipped off Cameron's sword and several ear bursting thunders echoed.*

Season: *He stood motionless with his hair flapping in the wind, staring at Cameron in a worried manner.* (I'm completely vulnerable!-)

Darkwing: *It noticed Cameron's lack of presence, causing it to focus its attention back to Season.* "Skree." *Its legs vibrated as it readied to pounce Season.*

Cameron: *He smirked, as the thunder rumbled around his sword.* "Harr!" *He sliced the sword across and the force blasted the Darkwing into pieces.*

Season: *He watched the ground explode where the Darkwing once stood.* (Amazing-) *He glanced at pieces of bones rolling across the ground, followed by swirls of dirt and dust.*

Cameron: *He landed on the ground, causing his armour to rattle and he looked at Season.* "Are you okay?"

Season: *He hid his shocked expression and coughed.* "I am, thank you." *He lowered the trident, causing the tornado around them to dissipate.*

*The Darkwings trapped in Season's Rostical screeched and plummeted towards the ground.*

Cameron: *He sheathed the sword behind his shoulder, causing it to become invisible.* "Hmm?" *He looked up to the Darkwings in confusion.* "Why do they not flap their wings?"

Season: "Not sure, you want them to win?" *He watched the Darkwing's bones smash on the ground upon impact around the party.*

Cameron: *He looked around and relaxed his body in a casual state.* "No signs of threat."

Season: "Indeed." *He watched small pulse-like swirls of dust spiral around each of the Darkwing's remains.*

Cameron: *He turned around, facing the unconscious Chrisma, Tyler and Joy.* "What about your allies?"

Season: "My friend will-"

Alicia: *She dived down and slid along the ground, catching Cameron's attention.* "S-Season!-" *She ran up to him and gave him a hug, smiling in happiness.*

Season: "Hohoho, I was just talking about you."

Alicia: "W-What about?" *She stepped back in confusion, biting her bottom lip.*

Cameron: "Season." *He reminded Season, as he glanced at the unconscious party members.*

Season: "Ahem, yes. Alicia-" *He motioned his hand towards Tyler, Chrisma and Joy.*

Alicia: *She quickly walked up to them without being asked.* (I have the power...)

*Alicia kneeled down and cupped her hands as her eyes shined a beautiful golden colour.*

Cameron: *He looked at Alicia, staring at her back in a strange manner.* (What does she intend on doing?)

Alicia: "Sacred light of Radiatons cluster and form-" *A white glyph shined under her and a ball of light formed itself high in the sky above the party.*

Cameron: *His eyes widened in shock.* (Power of light?!)

Alicia: "Aid and replenish what has been lost, SOOTHING LIGHT" *Five streams of light fell down and burst on top of each party member.*

Cameron: *He looked at his arm in amazement, watching the damages from his fight with Dakota visibly heal.* (My wounds Joy and Chrisma could not heal.. This light is healing me!)

Season: *He closed his eyes and smiled, as white strings clustered around his visible cuts and bruises.* (Soothing, warm, such a nice feeling.)

*Tyler, Chrisma and Joy all gasped into consciousness, as a soothing wind of light revitalised their stamina.*

Alicia: *She stood up with formed fists, looking over her shoulder at Cameron and Season.* "What were those things?"

Tyler: "W-What happened?" *He mumbled in confusion, instinctively grabbing onto his RPG bag.*

Cameron: "We were ambushed." *He sounded and looked annoyed as if he was embarrassed.*

Joy: *She nodded her head at Cameron, tugging on her robes.* "They came out of nowhere."

Alicia: *She turned around, facing Season in a curious manner.* "What happened? What were you doing?"

Tyler: "Alicia." *He caught her attention and greeted her with a smirk, causing Alicia to wave.*

Season: "We finally met up and discussed what's happened in each other's absence."

Joy: "After a brief conversation, it was the moment we activated the pathway to the city-"

Chrisma: "That's when we were attacked!" *She spread her arms, overdramatising the story.*

Season: "I have absolutely no idea what they were. I don't think they like light-based Rostical, they went for Joy and Chrisma first."

Alicia: *She glanced at Season's large red trident which stood three times higher than him.* "They were the same creatures that attacked me in the swamp-"

Season: *He tightened his grip on the trident, causing it to disintegrate into tiny red beads.* (The arrival of the Consultant's weakness, these never-before-seen creatures engulfed in shadow.. This is no coincidence-)

Tyler: "Umm, how come you couldn't sense them, Season?"

Season: "I honestly don't know." *He shook his head, looking at Cameron.* "What about you, Cameron? Scoldrant Users have a natural heightened ability to sense."

Cameron: *He nodded his head in agreement.* "I can sense nearly everything-"

Chrisma: "He did sense Alicia, so Season was able to use long ranged Rostical."

Alicia: "O-Oh-?" *She quickly glanced at Season, smiling in gratitude.* "Th-Thank you-"

Cameron: "But.. Only living creatures."

Tyler: "Huh?"

Alicia: "W-What are you saying?"

Tyler: *He stood up and adjusted the RPG bag around his shoulder.* "Th-They're not alive?"

*Cameron nodded his head, as Joy and Chrisma helped each other onto their feet.*

Tyler: *He gripped the strap to the bag, gulping in fear.* (Like undead creatures?!)

Chrisma: "Oh, get in." *She breathed heavily as she supported herself on Joy's arms.*

Joy: "If Season nor Cameron could sense those creatures, what were they? A new type of Remenistal?"

Season: "Perhaps.. Rostical does work in wondrous ways."

Tyler: "A-At the very least, we should go to the research facility and explain to Dawn what we just encountered."

Season: "That sounds like a splendid plan, Tyler."

Alicia: "Umm. Have you seen anyone else?"

Season: "I have not. The last two people I spoke to, were PKMY and Teresa."

Chrisma: *She shivered and groaned in thought, causing Joy to look at her strangely.* (Teresa scares the Astragons out of me when she's stern!)

Joy: "Either way, let us go. We're all exhausted."

Cameron: "A valid point from Joy-" *He walked past the party and glanced at Joy, stepping towards the edge of the cliff.*

Joy: *She stepped away from Chrisma and walked towards Cameron, staring at the island in thought.* (I'm amazed how I'm not in any pain.. Did Chrisma really obtain such power in my absence? Or was it something else..?)

Tyler: *He focused his attention on Alicia, happily playing with the RPG bag's flap.* "Madora is in the city, Alicia."

Alicia: "Oh really?" *She spoke with a smile, walking up to Tyler.* "I'll have to say hello."

Tyler: "Yes." *He turned around and walked with Alicia towards Joy and Cameron.*

Alicia: "It's good seeing you again." *She stopped, smiling at Tyler.*

Tyler: "Y-You too." *He smiled, nervously chuckling in a modest manner.*

Joy: *She glanced at Cameron, Alicia and Tyler, before focusing her attention back to the island.* "I'll open the doorway now."

Chrisma: *She looked down, staring at the damage caused by the fight.* "..." (Those strange black marks.)

Season: *He noticed Chrisma staring at the ground, causing him to approach her in curiosity.* "Something on your mind?"

Chrisma: "I've encountered dark-based Scoldrants before, they were terrifying." *She paused and looked up to Season.* "Those creatures gave off a similar, cold feeling."

Season: "I see."

Chrisma: "..."

Season: "At the very least, it's normal to feel that way."

Chrisma: "Y-Yes.." *She nodded her head and faced the party as an aura-based path connected to the island.* "We're going to be left behind-"

Season: "Go ahead, I'll catch up before the path fades."

Chrisma: "Oh bless-" *She nodded her head and jogged towards the party.*

Season: *He silently watched the party walk across the path.* (Something, doesn't feel right-)

*Season held his stomach with a worried expression, looking up to the sky.*

Season: (Surpreon... I will quickly teleport back and-)

Alicia: "S-Season!" *She yelled at Season from the entrance of the city, snapping him out of his daydream-like stare.*

Season: *He coughed, looking over to the party.* "Ahem-"

Alicia: "L-Let's go!"

Season: *He ran across the ground and over the path, hobbling towards the party.* "Coming!"

----------

Ridley: *He smirked and stared at a massive Spacial Funnel, watching it warp in front of him.* (I've gathered the appropriate amount of Astragons to bend the space-)

*Ridley carefully twitched his arms as if he was containing the Spacial Funnel.*

Ridley: (Now.. Neurons was something I always had trouble with.)

----------

Sofia: *She casually flew above the clouds with a bored expression.* (I can sense our Hi-Ougi causing havoc-)

*Sofia giggled evil-like and spread her arms, spinning around in a carefree manner.*

Sofia: (I love this..)

----------

*The party walked through a bright light, entering Silver Wind Island with satisfied faces.*

Joy: *She stood in a relaxed manner, watching busy people walk up and down the stairs to different levels of the city.* (I hope Lupton isn't making a scene somewhere.)

Alicia: *She admired the city and closely observed its structure, before looking at Tyler.* "Tyler, where is Madora? I'd like to see her."

Tyler: "She's-"

Season: "Pardon, but do you mind if I take you there, Alicia? I'd like to know what has happened on your end."

Alicia: "O-Okay."

Season: "If you don't mind, Tyler?"

Tyler: "N-No problem." *He shook his head, smiling in respect.*

Joy: "Well, Chrisma, Cameron and Tyler, could you three escort me to the castle? I wish to speak with Grey."

Chrisma: "Yes."

Tyler: "Of course."

Cameron: "I accept your request."

Joy: *She faced Alicia and Season.* "I'll meet you two in the research facility?"

Season: "That you will." *Alicia nodded her head in agreement.*

Tyler: *He looked at Season in confusion.* "Our destinations are in the castle, why not walk with us?"

Alicia: *She shook her head.* "I'd like to ask Season something anyway."

Tyler: "Oh, that's okay then." *He shook his head in understanding and faced the castle in the distance.*

Joy: "Please, don't fall behind." *She smiled Season and Alicia off and started to walk down the busy road-like path.*

Season: *He watched Joy, Chrisma, Cameron and Tyler walk away, causing him to look at Alicia.* "Let's talk and explore the city."

Alicia: "O-Okay."

Tyler: (After discussing the Consultant's weakness, I don't know why we're not in a hurry-) *He frowned in deep thought, looking down to his feet.* (Two days and we have no idea where he even is!)

Chrisma: "We've made it to safety, and Season has graced us with his presence-" *She skipped next to Tyler and leant on his shoulder.* "Smile more."

Tyler: "Chrisma-?" *He looked up, staring at her in shock.*

Chrisma: "What's with that face?"

Tyler: "I wasn't expecting something so..."

Cameron: (Mature sounding..) *He smirked to himself as he quietly followed Joy to the castle.*

Chrisma: *She sniffed the air, causing her attention to drift away from the conversation.* "That smells nice!"

Tyler: "Huh-?"

*Chrisma slapped Tyler on the shoulder in excitement and skipped away from him.*

Tyler: "O-Ouch."

Chrisma: "Whoup whoup-" *She groaned under her breath, swaying her arms above her head.*

Tyler: *He slightly shook his head and sighed, looking back down in thought.* (I better go straight into scanning for unknown Astragons or Neurons. We need to know where he is-)

Joy: *She stared at the castle and slowed down, avoiding a cluster of busy people.* "Well-"

Cameron: "..." *He walked with an emotionless face, watching the cluster of people awkwardly avoid him.*

Tyler: "A-Ah-" *He squirmed as the people rudely walked past and nudged him on each side.*

Chrisma: *She loosely followed the party and sniffed around, groaning on her breath.* "Where is that delicious smell coming from?"

Joy: *She stopped and looked over her shoulder as a gentle breeze brushed against her robes.* "We're here."

Cameron: *He stopped next to Joy and closed his eyes, waiting for Chrisma and Tyler.* "Joy, our findings about his weakness, what will we do with such information?"

Joy: "That is exactly why I want to speak with Ordin and Grey."

Cameron: "I see." *He opened his eyes, staring at the castle.*

Tyler: *He stopped in between Cameron and Joy, watching the flags flap in the wind.* "I know you asked me to escort you to Grey, but would it be alright if I go into the research facility instead?"

Joy: "Of course you can-"

Chrisma: *She ran past the party and towards the castle, waving her arms in the air.* "Whoup whoup!"

Joy: "Chrisma? What is the meaning of this abnormal behaviour?!"

Chrisma: *Joy's words instantly caused her to stop.* "I-I, umm-" *She took a deep breath, slowly lowering her arms.*

Joy: "It would seem the excitement of adventure has gotten to your head." *Her tone was stern and filled with authority.*

Chrisma: "Oh, bless-" *She turned around and faced the party with a slight bow.* "Excuse me-"

Joy: "We will talk about this at an appropriate time, now is not it." *She walked towards Chrisma and waved her arm, causing the castle's doors to warp.*

Chrisma: *She nervously held her robes with a glowing red face, watching Joy walk past her.* (I'm really embarrassed-)

*Chrisma turned around and faced the castle's doors while keeping her head lowered.*

Chrisma: (Bless..) *She sighed at herself and dragged her feet towards the castle, stepping through doors.*

*Cameron and Tyler looked at each other with slight grins before walking into the castle.*

----------

*Alicia and Season walked up several stairs to the third level of the city, holding kebab-like food in their hands.*

Season: "So, what did you want to talk about?" *He looked to his side, biting a meat chunk off the stick.*

Alicia: "I haven't really told anyone this besides the people that know. But I was given a choice."

Season: "A choice? Who has the right to give you a choice-?"

Alicia: "The Voice of On."

Season: *He continued to walk up the stairs, slowly chewing with widening eyes.* "..."

Alicia: "And-" *She quickly stepped to the side and avoided a group of royal looking women walking down the stairs.* "I keep changing my decision."

Season: *He noticed a bridge, which connected to the other side.* "What do you mean, you keep changing it?"

Alicia: "Once I'm certain I've made up my mind, I think of what my decision would impact.. And that, is what keeps me from making my decision definite."

Season: "Please explain what the problem is." *He hobbled onto the bridge and leant on the rail, watching people walk across the entrance of the city.*

Alicia: *She leant on the rail next to Season and opened her mouth, taking a small petite bite from the kebab.* "The decision either affects myself or others."

Season: "Herm?"

Alicia: *She paused, watching the crowds walk up and down the stairs.* "Umm-"

Season: "It's fine, take your time."

Alicia: *She nervously bit her bottom lip and slowly inhaled.* "If I choose to accept strong powers, I need to let go of my attachments."

Season: *He chewed and swallowed.* "I'm sorry, I don't quite get you?"

Alicia: "I have to let go of my friends, family, whatever attaches me to this land."

Season: "..." *He slowly nodded his head in understanding.* "And if you choose not to accept this power?"

Alicia: "Then, I won't have that power to heal the sick, heal the wounded, heal diseases, heal-"

Season: "That's quite enough."

Alicia: *She stuttered, looking up to Season in a lost-like state.* "W-What should I do?"

Season: "Doesn't healing people make you happy?"

Alicia: "Y-Yes." *She looked down in sadness, watching people walk under the bridge.* "But, so do you, my friends, Lance.."

Season: "Okay. Correct me if I'm wrong. If you decide to let go of your attachments, and gain the power to heal the sick, you'll eventually bump into us, because we'll probably be doing the same thing, correct?"

Alicia: "Yes." *She slowly whispered, as if she was unsure where Season was going with the conversation.*

Season: "Well, you're already healing with us present."

Alicia: "Y-Yes?"

Season: "And while doing this, you're being happy at the same time."

Alicia: "Y-Yep."

Season: "So, I'd know what my answer would be."

Alicia: *She silently looked away, as if she didn't get it.* "..."

Season: *He smiled at Alicia, looking back over the rail.* "You're already healing while being with your friends... It's pretty obvious what my decision would be."

Alicia: (I do heal well as it is-) *She thought in realisation and smiled in relief, facing Season.* "Thank you so much, Season."

Season: "You're very welcome-" *He faced Alicia and stared at the light on her pendant.*

Alicia: "I never once stopped thinking about this-"

Season: "Sometimes, you just need to think simple."

Alicia: "S-Simple?"

Season: "It's possible that arduous choices or situations are rather quite simple to solve."

Alicia: "I understand what you mean, but this was not a simple choice."

Season: *He shook his head with a smile.* "Despite being frowned upon, simplicity could be your greatest friend."

Alicia: "I-..?" *She shook her head as if she didn't understand.*

Season: "If your thoughts cause you such stress or emotional grief, either get it off your chest or just stop thinking about it."

Alicia: "Stop thinking about it?"

Season: "Your mind is like a muscle, you need to let it rest or it'll get sore."

Alicia: "You're saying, I shouldn't over think?"

Season: "Exactly."

Alicia: "... Thank you, Season." *She spoke softly, taking in what Season said.*

Season: "But remember, the choice I suggested.. That's what I'd do."

Alicia: "Y-Yes, I know-" *She looked at Season in the eyes, smiling in gratitude.* "You've really helped-"

*Two ladies in old-fashioned dresses holding umbrellas walked past Alicia and Season.*

Lady in Pink: "That man with the cute little Scoldrant was immensely attractive."

Lady in Blue: "The one with the red-haired woman?"

Lady in Pink: "Yes."

Lady in Blue: "I personally think, the one that spoke strangely, the one with the royal lunar-shaped pendant, was way more attractive."

Lady in Pink: "Oh please, you have no taste in men."

Alicia: *She watched the ladies walk over the bridge and out of her sight.* "A man that spoke strangely with a lunar-shaped pendant?"

Season: "A man with a Scoldrant, with a woman of red hair?"

Alicia: (Lance!-)
Season: "Holland."

Alicia and Season: "PKMY!-" *They quickly faced the entrance of the city and instantly noticed Freya, causing them to smile.*

Season: "They're in the city! Let's go and-" *He looked to his side and noticed Alicia running adorable-like out of his sight.*

--

PKMY: "We finally made it." *She grunted in accomplishment, stretching her arms over her head.*

Freya: "Gruff!"

Lance: "'Bout time, aye." *He sighed, dropping his arms in satisfaction.*

*Freya and Holland sniffed the air in excitement, causing nearby people to look at them strangely.*

Holland: "All this action has got me famished-"

Freya: "Ruff!" *She wagged her tail in agreement.*

PKMY: "Should we-?" *She stepped forward and faced the party in a serious manner.* "Get something to eat, or go straight to the castle?"

Holland: "Food!"

Lance: "I'm starvin' too, but-"

Holland: "But?" *He looked at Lance, sounding regretful of what he will say.*

Lance: "Let's get rid of the borin' stuff first, then have a victory feast."

Freya: "Grr." *She growled in disagreement.*

PKMY: "The try hard is right."

Lance: "Isn't that gettin' old, Docta Jingles?"

PKMY: *She folded her arms in an authority-like manner, glaring at Lance.* "Not really."

Holland: "But food sounds pretty good." *He sighed and slouched in a defeated manner, knowing he wasn't going to eat.* "I find people are better at understanding on a full stomach."

PKMY: "Heh, awfully insightful, Holly."

Freya: *She tilted her head in curiosity and sniffed the air, wagging her tail.* (A familiar scent.)

Holland: (Who?)

Lance: *He looked down and noticed Freya sniffing the air with her eyes closed.* "Wat's wrong with the fleabag?"

PKMY: "That's Freya to you."

Lance: *He rolled his eyes.* "Pssht, watev-"

Alicia: "Lance!" *She skipped in ecstasy down the stairs and towards Lance.*

Lance: "A-Alic-" *He gasped under his breath, turning around in shock.*

Alicia: "Tee hee-" *She happily skipped around several people, keeping eye contact with Lance.*

Lance: "Alicia-" *He chuckled in disbelief, eagerly spreading his arms.*

Alicia: "Lance.." *She bear hugged him and mumbled, tightly planting her face in his chest.*

Lance: "I missed you-" *He hugged her tightly and kissed her on the head.*

Alicia: (I've missed you too-) *She inhaled deeply, smiling in a relaxed manner.* (I feel safe now.. I feel warm..)

Lance: "It's good to see someone beautiful again-"

PKMY: "Blargh, such a cliché." *She stuck out her tongue and wheezed, pretending to throw up.*

Lance: "Sh-Shuddup." *He smirked in a shy manner, kissing Alicia on the forehead.*

Alicia: "Tee hee-" *She slowly released her grip, causing Lance to let go.*

Lance: *He sighed with blushing cheeks and noticed Freya staring at him.* "Shut it, fleabag!"

Freya: "Grr-"

Lance: "Don't expect the same treatment from me."

Freya: "Grrrarff!" *She frizzed her fur, gritting her teeth at Lance.*

Alicia: *She stepped back, cupping her pendant with both hands.* "PKMY, Holland.. I'm s-sorry for leaving like that."

Holland: *He chuckled, scratching his cheek in understanding.* "That's okay-"

PKMY: *She quickly stormed up, violently slapping Alicia across the face.* "Hmph-"

Alicia: *Her jaw dropped in shock.* "P-PKMY?"

Holland: (Amy?)
Lance: "Wat the-?!"

PKMY: "..." *She silently turned away and folded her arms, ignoring her surroundings.*

*Lance, Holland and Freya stared at PKMY with puzzled faces, unsure what to say.*

Alicia: "I-I'm sorry-"

PKMY: *She shook her head, closing her eyes in a stern manner.* "I was worried about you.."

Alicia: *She stood in silence, lowering her arms.* (Worried?)

PKMY: "Just say you're sorry like usual, and-"

Alicia: "Thank you."

PKMY: *She opened her eyes in shock.* "H-Huh?"

Alicia: "I'm glad I have friends like you-" *She glanced at each party member, biting her bottom lip with a confident smile.*

Freya: "Gerooh?"

Alicia: "It makes me feel, wanted." *She smiled and held her sun-shaped pendant with both hands.*

PKMY: "Heh." *She smirked and turned around, sighing under her breath in an impressed-like manner.*

Lance: *He focused all his attention to Alicia.* "So wat were you doin'? Where did you go?"

Alicia: "Umm-"

Season: "Perhaps she could explain once the entire party is up to date with the news?" *He walked towards the party, gathering their attention.*

Lance: "If it ain't Season."

Holland: "Hello again." *He smiled, nodding his head in a masculine manner.*

PKMY: (Caesar..) *She walked up to him and gave him a hug.*

Season: (How are you holding up?)

PKMY: (I was upset, but I've been too busy to dwell on it.)

Season: (Me too-) *They stepped apart and stood in a casual posture.*

Holland: "You were here too, who else is here?"

Freya: "Ruff!"

Season: "Everyone, besides Teresa and Pepper."

PKMY: *She instantly looked down to the dark brown, stone ground, mumbling in deep thought.* (Teresa, where are you? What are you doing...?)

Season: *He noticed Holland holding his stomach, causing him to hand over the kebab-like stick.* "Would you all like to come with me to the castle?"

Holland: "Thanks!" *He grabbed the stick in appreciation, smiling at the food in excitement.* (Did you want some, Freya?)

Freya: (No, thank you.. Being in your inner-self restores my Neurons, so I'm not that hungry.)

Lance: *He placed his hands on his head, looking at Season.* "Yea."

Holland: "Sure thing." *He chewed with enthusiasm.*

PKMY: *She ignored the party, nodding her head in thought.* (After our fight with mummy, she.. Wouldn't do anything reckless, right-?)

Season: "Great, come on then."

Alicia: *She placed her hand on her cheek, slowly following Season.* "L-Let's go."

Lance: "Season, Holland, stinky and me walked straight down the road-like path, past the groups of busy people towards the castle."

Season: "Hohoho, oh, Lance.."

Lance: "Season chuckled like the chubby guy in red and said my name."

Alicia: "I'm not stinky."

Lance: "You're right."

Alicia: "I-I am?"

Lance: "You're beautiful and stinky."

Alicia: "Tee hee."

Holland: "Beautiful and stinky." *He mimicked Lance's voice, causing Season to discreetly chuckle.*

Lance: "Shut it."

Holland: "Haha, sorry." *He spoke with his mouth full, taking another bite of the kebab.*

Freya: (PKMY? Are you okay?) "Growooh?" *She trotted next to PKMY, brushing herself against her leg in an affectionate manner.*

PKMY: "Y-Yea-" *She looked up, noticing the party halfway down the path.* "Oh-"

Freya: "Gruff-"

PKMY: "Oh right-" *She reached down to Freya and motioned her head to hop on.*

Freya: *Her body shrunk in size and she jumped up on PKMY's hand.* "Growlith."

PKMY: "Your level of Astragon control.. It's cool how you can do that now."

Freya: "Gruff!" *She hopped up PKMY's arm and stood on her shoulder, wagging her tail.* (Let's go-)

PKMY: "Right-" *She shook her head and jumped forward, running after the party in determination.*

Freya: *She looked at PKMY, sticking her tongue out in a canine manner.* (What were you thinking about?)

PKMY: "Umm-"

----------

*Joy and Tyler stood outside the castle and waited for Season, fidgeting in an impatient manner.*

Season: *He approached the castle with Holland, Alicia and Lance, noticing Joy and Tyler.* "What are they doing?"

Lance: *He shrugged his shoulders.* "How would I know?"

Holland: "There's Tyler."

Lance: "..." *He looked at Holland, as if it was obvious.* "Yes.. There he is.."

Holland: "He's looking a little braver, isn't he?"

Alicia: *She held Lance's hand, nodding her head in agreement.* "I noticed the same thing."

Lance: "Huh?"

Season: "He means stronger."

Holland: "Yeah."

Lance: "Gah, why don't you just say that in the first place?" *He rolled his eyes and stepped on the grass, approaching Joy and Tyler.*

Tyler: "Lance, Holland, it's good to see you two again."

Lance: "Yea, nice." *He rolled his eyes, discreetly rubbing Alicia's hand with his thumb.*

Holland: "And you too."

Tyler: *He smiled in modesty, resting an arm over his RPG bag.* "Thank you."

Season: "Joy, Tyler, you didn't have to wait for me."

Joy: "That's not it."

Lance: "So, wat's it?"

Season: "Lance." *He spoke sternly.*

Lance: "Sorry.." *He sighed, looking away like a child.*

Alicia: (Tee hee-)

Tyler: ".. Ah.."

Holland: "You don't seem the best, Tyler."

Tyler: "It's.. Umm."

Joy: *She noticed Tyler's awkward face, causing her to step forward.* "It's-"

PKMY: *She casually jogged in between Holland and Lance.* (Caught up in no time.)

Freya: "Gruff!" *She barked in a squeak-like manner, wagging her tail in a victorious manner.*

PKMY: (Huh? Who's feeling that?) *She awkwardly stared at Tyler, causing him to look uncomfortable.*

Tyler: "W-What is it, PKMY?"

PKMY: "I sense a lot of discomfort-" *She glanced at Joy.* "Coming from the both of you."

Joy: (How did she-?)

Season: "Hmm-" *He looked at PKMY, causing him to glance at Joy and Tyler with an impatient frown.* "Explain yourselves."

Joy: "It's Grey and Ordin.."

Lance: "Aye? Who are they?"

Holland: "Grey is the ruler of this city, and Ordin is his subordinate." *He mumbled so only Lance could hear.*

Lance: "Thanks." *He mumbled back in appreciation.*

Season: "What about them?"

Joy: "They're absent."

PKMY: "Absent? The ruler can't be absent."

Season: "..."

Joy: "Even his guards are gone."

Season: "Gone?"

Lance: "So, this guy just left?"

Holland: "That's not good."

Alicia: "W-What happened?"

Joy: "I'm not sure what could've happened."

Season: "Impossible. Grey would never leave the city, let alone, leaving its defences behind."

Tyler: "It could be different in this city, but royalty aren't usually meant to leave without an escort."

Lance: "If the two guys are missin', maybe he's the one escortin' him?"

Tyler: "Ordin was last reported heading to The Elemental Tower about an intruder."

Joy: "Sorry to interrupt, but could we talk inside the research facility?"

Season: "Yes." *He looked at the party and walked into the castle, causing the doors to ripple around him.*

PKMY: "Come on then." *She grunted, causing Freya to bark in agreement.*

Lance: "His majesty, lady that hangs out with Chrisma, ogre, ranga, stinky and me, walked towards the castle-"

PKMY: "Try hard." *She grunted with a raised fist, walking through the doors.*

Alicia: "I-I'm not stinky." *She frowned in a playful manner and let go of Lance's hand, skipping into the castle.*

Tyler: "And as his majesty, I demand of you to stay outside."

Holland: "Haha."

Lance: *He paused, watching the party silently walk into the castle.* "Oi, I was jokin' guys!"

----------

Sofia: *She descended through prehistoric trees and landed on solid ground, causing her wings to disintegrate into nothing.* "I'm back."

*Sofia giggled and ignored the prehistoric roars, which echoed in the distance.*

Sofia: "I can feel them..." *She whispered with a smirk, licking her lips in a pleasurable-like manner.*

*The plants moved on their own accord as if they were frightened of Sofia's presence.*

Sofia: *She walked towards a cliff, brushing her fingers along the ferns.* "I wonder how many there are now?"

*Sofia walked across the cliff to the edge and looked down, gasping in amazement.*

Sofia: "Wow." *She whispered under her breath and smirked evil-like.* "This will crash the levelling system of the game-"

*Thousands of screeches responded to Sofia's presence, causing her to chuckle.*

Sofia: *She scanned across the ground, observing thousands of Darkwings moving about.* (Excellent, my loyal pawns are growing in numbers.) "Hahehahe, hahehahe heheha."

----------

Lance: *He grunted, walking up the white staircase to the hallway.* (Phew-) *He watched the party cluster together, causing him to walk towards them.*

Joy: *She stepped on the polished floors, giving the sound she wore high-heels.* (Things seem to be getting worse and worse.) *She nervously sighed to herself, waiting for the party to collect themselves.*

Season: *He stood next to Tyler, discreetly glancing at Joy.* (What aren't they telling us?)

Alicia: *She stood on the red carpet in the middle of the hallway, staring up to the ceiling in deep thought.* (I hope this is the right decision-)

Lance: *He quickly walked beside Alicia and held her hand.* "'Sup, Grottom Bottom?"

Alicia: "..." *She noticed the party starting to walk forward.*

Lance: "You know, I was jokin' before, right?"

Alicia: "Tee hee, I was too."

Lance: (What a loser..) *He smirked with hidden relief, slowly following the party down the hallway.* (But, I couldn't ask for anyone else.)

Joy: *She led the party down the hallway, taking a left to the research facility.* "Here-"

Season: *He walked with the party into the research facility.* (Wow, it's much bigger than my research facility.)

Joy: *She stopped and scanned across the quiet room.* "Tyler-"

Lance: *He stopped behind the party and shivered.* (It's slightly colder in here than the rest of the castle.)

Tyler: *He stared at Joy, taking a deep breath and nodded his head.* "There's also something else."

Season: *He looked at Tyler in a worried manner as if he knew there was more to tell.* "What is it?"

Tyler: "It's Madora."

Season: *He looked to the side and noticed Cameron, Chrisma and Dawn, standing in a clustered group of researchers.* "What about her?"

Joy: *She stared at the group of researchers with a worried look.* "She's ill."

PKMY: *She looked shocked and stepped forward, staring at Joy.* "Ill?"

Lance: "No way."

Holland: "No way, what?"

Lance: "It's the old fart, she's one of the strongest people I know."

Season: "He's not wrong-"

Alicia: "Maybe I could heal her?"

*Cameron, Chrisma and Dawn noticed the party, causing them to stop talking.*

Chrisma: "Oh, Joy."

Joy: "How is she?"

Holland: "Who's she? Madora?"

Freya: "Gerooh?"

Lance: "Man, I don't like this whole, leave you in the dark feelin', aye."

Chrisma: *She shook her head and stepped away from the clustered group of researchers, revealing Madora to the party.* "..."

*A researcher accidentally bumped Dawn on the side, causing her to knock into another researcher.*

Dawn: "I can't breathe, everyone back to your stations!"

Researchers: "Ma'am!" *They shuffled away and spread throughout the facility back into their seats.*

Madora: "I, yes, the seal, the sealing has sealed-" *She swayed on the spot and laughed to herself.*

Season: "M-Madora!"

PKMY: (What-?!)

Tyler: "..."

*Season, PKMY and Alicia ran up to Madora, gathering around her in shock and confusion.*

Holland: *He observed Madora, scratching his head in thought.* (She doesn't look with it..)

Alicia: "M-Madora?"

Madora: "Oh, hello you three." *She chuckled in confusion, looking at them indirectly.*

Season: "What have the Astragons done to you?" *He waved his arms around Madora in shock, as if he was scanning her.*

PKMY: *She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, frowning in concentration.* (I...) "I only feel confusion, lost, and a constant dizzy-like sick feeling."

Alicia: "Ahem-" *She placed her hand on Madora's chest and closed her eyes.* "HEALING RINGS"

*White rings materialised in the air around her, catching Dawn's attention.*

Dawn: *She stared at the light, causing her glasses to reflect its light.* (Like Lezard!-)

Madora: "Won't work, you can't, I can't see, everything is blurry-"

Alicia: *She noticed the rings' light fade, causing her to pause in confusion.* (It's not working-?)

PKMY: "Why isn't it working?" *She grunted in a worried manner.*

Alicia: "The rings don't glow if the person isn't hurt or if it's too late." *She lowered her arms in defeat, causing the rings to disintegrate.*

Cameron: "Tyler and myself found her wandering the lower hallways."

Tyler: *He walked up to Season, nodding his head.* "It was like she was lost."

Dawn: *She stormed up to a Rosterology console and grunted in frustration.* "There's something else as well!"

Tyler: "M-More bad news?"

Dawn: "We've detected a massive Neuron output."

Alicia: *She looked shocked, keeping her attention on Madora.* (An explosion?)

Dawn: "And a pulse of pure Astragons."

Lance: "Oh no.." *He moaned under his breath, before losing focus on the conversation.* "This is where it starts to get nerdy on me."

PKMY: "It was probably the fight we had with Tar-"

Dawn: "It resonated in and from Surpreon." *Her words caused PKMY to pause and look surprised.*

PKMY: "Wha-?"

Season: *He quickly faced Dawn, grunting in a worried manner.* "Surpreon?"

Tyler: "When I heard Surpreon was involved, I checked it myself.. This wave of Astragons spread throughout both continents."

PKMY: (A pulse that affected both continents?!)

Season: "I have no idea what it could be-" *He shook his head in a guilty manner and started to walk towards a Rosterology console.*

PKMY: *She silently observed Season as if she knew what he was feeling.* (Caesar..)

Season: "Pardon my actions everyone, I need to see what is wrong with Surpreon-"

Dawn: *She cracked her fingers and typed on a keyboard-like device, purposely interrupting Season.* "There's another problem."

Holland: "Another?!"

Madora: "The damage is done, poof-" *She spread her arms as if she was motioning a large explosion.*

Lance: (I get lost with these Newrongs and Astragongs-) *He looked around with a bored expression and started to play with a nearby Rosterology console.*

Rosterology Console: "Access denied."

Lance: "Ah.. Shot down." *He grunted to himself, sighing in boredom.*

Season: "It will have to wait, I shouldn't have left the city for this long-"

Dawn: "You won't be able to."

Season: "Sorry, not to disrespect your rules, but I need to get back to Surpreon-"

Dawn: "You can't."

PKMY: "Wat is that supposed to mean?" *She unintentionally frowned, folding her arms in frustration.*

Alicia: *She looked at Dawn, holding her pendant with one hand.* "W-Why can't he?"

Cameron: "The same pulse has disconnected a certain symbol from the Astragons."

Holland: "Astragons have symbols?"

PKMY: "In a way for you to understand, just think of a glyph, and imagine one of the lines gone."

Holland: "Ah, thanks." *He smiled in understanding, causing PKMY to half smirk back.*

Joy: "With something so advanced regarding Astragons, I would have gone to Madora.."

Season: "Back to why I can't go back to Surpreon?" *He spoke in a stern manner, moving the conversation along.*

Tyler: "With the disconnection in the Astragons, it was something specific."

Dawn: "In all my research.. I had never seen something like this."

PKMY: "What?"

Dawn: "It took us ages to find the formula affected by this pulse.."

Tyler: "And it was found by accident."

Alicia: "By accident?"

Dawn: "I've been expecting The Rostical Guild to come back for some time, but they still haven't returned. So, I activated a teleportation glyph-"

Lance: *He sighed and started to walk out.* "Pulse, formulas? I'm leavin'."

Holland: "Huh?" *He looked over his shoulder, watching Lance leave the room like a child.*

Season: (Surpreon is my home, I will leave immediately!) *He frowned in frustration and closed his eyes, causing a glyph to draw itself on the ground around him.*

PKMY: *She noticed the glyph, causing her to quickly look at Season.* (Don't be too long.)

Season: (I won't.)

Freya: (Hmm?) *Her ear twitched, listening to Lance's footsteps echo down the hallway.*

Alicia: "L-Lance-" *She faced the exit and started to walk towards it, glancing at each party member.* "P-Please excuse me-" *She spoke with respect and ran out of the room.*

PKMY: "Please continue."

Holland: *He quickly focused his attention back to Dawn.* (She hasn't lost me yet-)

Season: "What?!" *He grunted and opened his eyes, catching the party's attention.*

Dawn: "I'm sure Season found out what was affected by this pulse."

PKMY: "Wat's wrong? Why haven't you left yet?"

Season: "It's not, working?" *He spoke in confusion, watching the glyph's lines fade away.*

Tyler: "The formula that was affected, was just but one thing."

Cameron: "And that was teleportation."

Dawn: "Not even my research has found a solution to this unknown occurrence."

PKMY: "Tssk-" *She grunted and ignored Dawn, walking up to Season.*

Tyler: "I-It won't work, PKMY-"

PKMY: "Try it again, I've got a plan." *She had a flashback of helping Teresa use a teleportation glyph to get off The Aspestosis Ship.*

Season: *He nodded his head and spread his arms, focusing on the floor.* "Hermm-"

PKMY: *She grabbed Season's arm with both hands and concentrated, watching a glyph draw itself on the floor.* (Focus-)

Season: (It's working!-)

Cameron: *He patiently stared at PKMY and Season, noticing a slight breeze waft around them.* (They are pouring a lot of Neurons into that glyph.)

*The glyph glowed purple and instantly disintegrated into nothing, causing Season and PKMY to sigh in discomfort.*

Dawn: "And now you all witnessed firsthand what the results of this unknown pulse are."

Holland: "What exactly does this mean?"

Tyler: "To sum it up, nobody has the ability to teleport any more."

Joy: "That could explain why Terra has yet to make an appearance."

PKMY: "Eh?"

Joy: "She may have teleported somewhere far and has been unable to teleport back."

Holland: (Terra?)

Season: "That's a valid opinion, but Teresa is the fastest person I know. It wouldn't take her so long to get to a destination by foot."

PKMY: (That's true.)

Dawn: "With the demon, the Consultant, what are we to do?" *She took her glasses off and rubbed her temples, moaning in frustration.*

Madora: "They are spreading, like fire, they'll come." *She spoke in a crazy-like tone, intensely staring at the blank wall.* "Bones, bones, bones."

Cameron: *He observed Madora in confusion.* "Perhaps Neurons have gone to her head?"

Season: "Not possible. Madora, she's a powerful woman."

Apollo: (Powerful?) *His words echoed in Cameron's mind.*

Cameron: *He shook his head in response.* (I do not know.)

Season: "Don't let this impression give you an otherwise thought."

Cameron: "..." (People speak highly of this woman..-)

Joy: "If we can't teleport, then neither can the Consultant?"

Tyler: "M-Maybe?" *He looked at the party sounding optimistic.*

Chrisma: "Why aren't we trying to find the Consultant now? Wouldn't it be good to know where he is?"

PKMY: "What's the hurry? We should wait for Teresa to get back."

Chrisma: "Oh, she doesn't know?"

PKMY: "Doesn't know wat?"

Season: *He looked at PKMY, mumbling in concern.* (Amy..-)

Joy: "We found out he has-"

PKMY: *She gasped with widening eyes.* "Two days?!"

Joy: *She paused in shock, slowly nodding her head in agreement.* "We have two days to find him."

Holland: "Two?! Why?!"

Season: "His weakness is The Rubistral Moon."

Holland: "Yeah, I remember."

Tyler: "Well, that's when the next Rubistral Moon is-"

Joy: "In two days."

Holland: (Crud!-)

PKMY: *She gritted her teeth and frowned.* "OK, just let me know if I haven't missed anything out-"

*PKMY walked away from Madora and towards the party, catching their attention.*

PKMY: "We've got two days until The Rubistral Moon, correct?"

Joy: "Correct."

PKMY: "The Rubistral Moon is the Consultant's weakness, correct?"

Cameron: "Correct."

PKMY: "We can't teleport, or even use Rosterology items, correct?"

Dawn: "Correct."

PKMY: "We don't know where the Consultant is, correct?"

Tyler: "Not at the moment, but correct."

PKMY: "Then, we've failed."

Holland: "W-What?" *He coughed in shock at PKMY's reaction.*
Tyler: "H-Huh?"
Joy: ".. Oh my.."
Dawn: "Tsskt."

Season: "PKMY." *He sounded disappointed, causing her to glare at him.*

PKMY: "Well, it's true."

Holland: "You shouldn't give up so easily-"

PKMY: "Even if we knew where he was, with no teleportation, wat if he was three or four days away?"

Chrisma: "Oh bless.." *She spoke in sorrow, looking down to her feet.*

Freya: "Gerooh." *She whined, lowering her head.*

Dawn: *She noticed her researchers stop what they were doing and stare at PKMY.* "Have you finished lowering everyone's morale?"

PKMY: "Lowering morale? Don't give me that crap, I'm being realistic-"

Season: "PKMY, that's enough."

PKMY: "OK, if any of you have a plan, let me know-" *She shook her head in frustration and stormed towards the exit of the room.*

Holland: *He glanced around the silent facility, listening to only the sounds of PKMY's footsteps echo down the hallway.* "..."

*An alarm triggered a sudden beeping sound from a Rosterology screen, catching Dawn's attention.*

Dawn: "H-Huh?" *She stared at the screen in shock, as if she wasn't expecting it.*

Tyler: "What has it found?"

Dawn: *She stormed up to the console, pushing her glasses up with one finger.* "I don't know-"

*Dawn mumbled to herself and typed on the keyboard-like console, causing multiple screens to pop up on the screen.*

Dawn: "What the research is this?" *She whispered under her breath and leant back in shock, catching Tyler's attention.*

Tyler: "W-What is it?"

Dawn: "A massive build-up of Astragons."

PKMY: *She stood just outside the door with her back against the wall, eavesdropping on the party's conversation.* (A build-up of Astragons? Maybe it's Teresa?)

Season: "Perhaps someone is trying to use a teleportation glyph not knowing the pulse's effect?"

Cameron: "That is a reasonable explanation-"

Dawn: *She leant closer to the screen in an interested manner, adjusting her glasses with two fingers.* (There's something else?)

Madora: "What you see, is what you seek." *She rocked back and forth, cackling to herself in an old brittle voice.*

Dawn: *She gasped, staring into space with a dumbfounded look.* (A Spacial Funnel?)

Tyler: *Dawn's reaction caused him to walk over to the screen.* "Hmm?"

Season: "What is it?" *He glanced at Tyler and Dawn in confusion.*

Joy: "Is it just someone trying to activate a glyph as Season stated?"

Tyler: "These signatures are for a Spacial Funnel."

Cameron: "What is the commotion over?" *He spoke as if the findings weren't important.* "Spacial Funnels discharge Astragons when someone walks through it-"

Dawn: "These levels of power-" *She quickly glanced across the room, pointing to a researcher in an urgent manner.* "Tell me the number of Spacial Funnels around these coordinates!"

Researcher: "Yes, ma'am." *He quickly faced the screen and readied his fingers on the console.*

Dawn: "The coordinates are-"

----------

Alicia: *She quickly followed Lance out of the castle.* "You walk too fast, Lance!"

Lance: "H-Huh?" *He snapped out of his dream-like state and turned around.* "H-Hey."

Alicia: "W-Why did you walk out like that?" *She stopped next to him, causing him to start walking again.*

Lance: "I dunno."

Alicia: *She sighed, quickly walking after him.* "Lance?"

Lance: *He slowed down, looking to his side at Alicia.* "I just don't like it."

Alicia: *She noticed a crowd of people up ahead, causing her to hold Lance's hand.* "Is that really it?"

Lance: "..."

Alicia: "I've only just noticed-" *She spoke in a mature, reassuring manner.* "-That you always act like a child when we explain things.. At first I thought it was your personality, but.."

Lance: "Arh.."

Alicia: "You don't have to tell me if you don't want to-"

Lance: *He tightly held her hand and looked up, watching people walk across the bridges.* "To tell the truth, I feel really stupid."

Alicia: "..." *She looked shocked, holding herself against Lance's arm in a supportive manner.*

Lance: "I sit there and it feels like I don't contribute... I really dislike that worthless feelin'."

Alicia: "Th-That's not true."

Lance: "Aye?"

Alicia: "You're good at what you do, and they're good at what they do.. You shouldn't compare yourself to the researchers."

Lance: "I guess.."

Alicia: "And, you're never worthless or stupid in my opinion." *She gently kissed Lance's arm, playing with his hand.*

Lance: *He smiled with his mouth open, kissing the top of Alicia's head.* "Thanks, you beautiful loser."

Alicia: (All this time he interrupted those type of talks, acted like a child and was disruptive, it was to hide his embarrassment of feeling like he didn't contribute? I really love him, I wish he spoke sooner, I'm certain nobody feels that way towards him-)

*Several yells came from a group of angry people surrounding a wooden booth, instantly catching Lance and Alicia's attention.*

Lance: *He intensely looked in the direction to the angry people, raising an eyebrow in curiosity.* (That scenario seems familiar-)

Alicia: *She looked alert, squeezing Lance's hand.* "Someone might be hurt?"

Lance: *He nodded his head in agreement, letting go of Alicia's hand.* "Let's check it out."

Alicia: "R-Right!"

Chapter 3: Fast Food Enterprise

Lance: *He ran up to the crowd and stood on his toes, snooping around.* "Wat's goin' on?"

Man: *He turned around with an impatient look, folding his arms in frustration.* "I've been waiting twenty minutes and my food was incorrect!"

Lance: "Huh?" *He observed the nearby booths, noticing they were all food markets.*

Alicia: *She stumbled behind Lance, trying to avoid the angry people.* "W-What's happening?"

Lance: "Hmm, it looks like someone doesn't know how to run a business-" *He turned around and faced Alicia as if he no longer cared.*

Alicia: "I-Is anyone hurt?"

Lance: "Nope, so let's go-"

?????: "I'm sorry, we're lack on staff!"

Lance: "Huh?" *The woman's voice caused him to stop.*

Alicia: *She looked up to Lance, tilting her head to one side.* "What's wrong?"

Lance: "That voice-" *He mumbled and turned around, causing Alicia to look into the same direction.*

Alicia: *She noticed a woman with long dark red hair, standing on a wooden stool.* "She looks exhausted."

Lance: *He nodded his head with empathy.* "Runnin' work with low crew can be."

Alicia: "Do you know her?"

Lance: "Yea, I think her name was Simone. It's been a while, though, reminded me of work, gah." *He shivered at the thought.*

Alicia: "Why are they getting cranky over something silly?"

Lance: "Only people who work retail know wat it's like to deal with stupidity, and that's comin' from me, aye, aha."

Simone: "Please be patient-" *Her words caused the aggravated customers to yell at her.*

Lance: "Umm." *He noticed the angry customers, causing him to stand on the spot, undecided what to do.*

Alicia: "Did you want to help her?"

Lance: *Alicia's words caused him to smile.* "If ya up for it?"

Alicia: "Tee hee, yep!"

Lance: "Aha-" *He frowned in determination and rudely shuffled through the crowd.*

Alicia: "L-Lance." *She watched him walk through the crowd, causing her to quickly follow.*

Lance: "Outta my way." *He grunted and stepped out of the crowd, finding himself next to the booth.*

Alicia: "A-Ah-" *She awkwardly stepped through the crowd and almost fell to the ground, stumbling next to Lance.* "W-What are you doing?"

Lance: *He kept to himself, closely staring at the people behind the counter.* "I'm going to observe the way they do business, then from those observations, I can adjust wat needs to be done."

Alicia: (Wow-) *She smiled at Lance's attitude and watched a woman hand out a tray of oily fries.*

----------

*The party clustered around Dawn who stood in front of the Rosterology console.*

Season: "I-I can't believe it." *He spoke slowly in disbelief, causing Chrisma to groan with curiosity.*

Chrisma: "I can't understand what this means?" *She groaned with a frown as if she wanted to know.*

Joy: *She held Madora up with both hands, looking at the screen in a curious manner.* (I'm not sure myself, but it looks like they've found something.)

Tyler: "If these readings are correct, then-"

Dawn: "Then we found the location to something with immense power."

Chrisma: "And?" *She pulled an awkward face, staring at the screen filled in confusion.*

Cameron: "And that could only be the Consultant."

Chrisma: "Oh, shit your face, get in!" *She whispered with a groan, tugging on her robes in excitement.*

Holland: *He stood with his arms over his head, smirking in response.* (This is great news.)

Joy: "I'm not familiar with the other continent, where is it located?"

Dawn: "Scanning now-" *She leant over the researcher and started to type at incredible speeds.*

Season: *He stared at the screen and watched an image of the continents display, showing a highlighted red dot in one area.* "And the location is only a day away, splendid."

Tyler: (So, we have a fighting chance after all?!) *He smiled with anticipation.*

Holland: "How come the signatures just suddenly started going?"

Chrisma: *She groaned in agreement, pointing at the Rosterology console.* "It just started beeping for no reason."

Dawn: "It could be due to several reasons, one being, the Consultant activated whatever is required to create such a Spacial Funnel."

Tyler: "Or, whatever is happening suddenly received a power boost which activated the sensors, like a threshold."

Dawn: "Yes."

Tyler: *He observed the screen in detail, squinting his eyes.* "Where the dot is, is that Eon City?"

Holland: *He slightly leant forward and stared at the screen.* "It looks like The Lost Land."

Tyler: "Are you sure?"

Holland: "Yeah."

Cameron: (As a Scoldrant User, we are naturally good with the terrain-)

Chrisma: "Are we really sure it's the Consultant?"

Season: "There are no Spacial Funnels located in that area, and only powerful beings could create a Spacial Funnel, Reality Sekais, yes, but not this."

Chrisma: "Oh?" *She sounded confused.*

Tyler: "So, unless we have another powerful creature causing this Spacial Funnel to manifest, it has to be the Consultant."

Dawn: *She nodded her head.* (The demon's energy signature is different-)

Chrisma: "I get it now, thank you."

Dawn: *Unreadable text popped up on the screen, catching her attention.* "He's right, The Lost Land."

Holland: "I'll go and tell PKMY the good news." *He lowered his arms and looked at the party with a smirk.*

Season: "Please do-"

Holland: (She came back in for a moment before leaving again-) *He jogged out of the facility and made his way down the hallway, frowning in thought.*

Dawn: "For research, don't run!" *She fist pumped the air, shouting at Holland.*

Chrisma: *She awkwardly glanced at Dawn, discreetly fist punching the air too.* (Get in! That felt good!)

Holland: *He excitedly jogged down the stairs, sliding one hand down the rail.* (Amy got frustrated of waiting for the detectors and decided to see what Lance and Alicia were doing, she's going to be excited we got a lead-)

Joy: "Now we know where the gentleman is, what are we going to do from here?"

Cameron: "..."

Dawn: *She paused and looked at each party member in confusion, pushing her glasses up with one finger.* (Good question.)

Chrisma: "But we can't teleport." *She groaned in failure as if that's what she was going to suggest.*

Tyler: (It would be good if they had planes over here.) *He mumbled in thought, playing with the strap to his RPG bag.*

Cameron: "With our combined mentality, I am positive, we are able to think of some other way to get there."

Season: "I said before, it's less than a day away."

Tyler: "It sounds like you have a plan, Season?"

Season: "I'd like to prepare a ship and use the natural current to sail around the island until we reach The Lost Land."

Dawn: (Using the idea of weather to gain the upper hand.. He's different from Grey...)

Cameron: "Humph." *He grunted in respect, smirking at Season's plan.*

Tyler: "Great!-"

*Joy and Chrisma smiled at each other and nodded their heads.*

Madora: "It's not good, she can't hear me, but she'll come... The mistress."

Joy: *She held Madora's arm in a worried manner, looking at Dawn.* "Have you scanned her? Or diagnosed what's happened?"

Dawn: "No, I haven't had the time, we found her moments before all this happened."

Season: "Okay. Someone run a diagnostic scan on Madora, while Dawn and myself will prepare a ship-"

Dawn: "We have a problem."

Tyler: "W-What problem?"

Season: "Hmm?"

Dawn: "It's about the remaining ships."

Season: "Remaining?"

----------

Woman: "You call this service!? I came here because I was promised fast service."

Teenager Girl: "I.. I..?" *She froze on the spot, unsure what to do.*

Woman: *She angrily pointed at a nearby food market.* "I could've already had my food by now and, had a few games in the entertainment section!"

Teenage Girl: *She stared at the angry customer from behind the counter and looked at Simone.* "I-I can't do this-" *She untangled her apron and threw it over the counter, causing Simone to gasp with a dropping jaw.*

Simone: "W-Where-?"

Teenager Girl: "Sorry-" *She looked upset and ran towards the back, storming out the booth.*

Simone: "Please-" *She looked behind her in a worried manner.*

Woman: "Now how am I meant to get my food?!"

Simone: "No!-" *She whispered under her breath, before focusing her attention back to the line of customers.*

Privileged Man: "You treat us like filthy Scoldrant Users? Disgusting!"

Simone: "I.."

Lance: "Ya want some help?" *He shouted with a smirk, sniffing his finger in a confident manner.*

Simone: *She looked at Lance as if she was about to cry and gasped.* "You! Lance?!"

Lance: "Yup."

Simone: "I-I don't know-"

Man: "Hurry up!" *A man's voice echoed from the back of the line, causing Simone to hesitantly and eagerly nod her head.*

Simone: "O-Okay!" *She motioned her hand to go around the booth, before quickly running out of the customers' vision.*

Woman: "Get back here!" *She shouted, mindlessly looking around the counter in anger.*

Man: "I paid to be treated like royalty!"

Alicia: *She silently stared at the customers, biting her bottom lip with anxiety.* (They're so angry over incorrect food? I've never seen such disgusting behaviour before... They must be warriors?)

Privileged Man: "Stupid people! I want food, now!"
Lance: "Oi." *He bumped Alicia, catching her attention.*

Stereotypical Haircut Lady: "I want to speak to the manager in charge!"
Alicia: *She snapped out of her thought, looking at Lance.* "Yes?"

Lance: "Follow me." *He turned around and started to jog around the back.*

Older Man: "That's why only dumb people work those jobs! How frustrating!"
Alicia: "Okay-" *She ignored the background complaints and stared at Lance's back, skipping after him in a cute manner.*

Lance: *He jogged around the corner, noticing Simone waiting for him.* "'Sup?"

Simone: "I don't know what to do?" *She whimpered, consumed with stress.* "I just don't?!"

Lance: *He noticed an apron hanging up, causing him to grab it.* "How exactly did this happen?"

Simone: "It started off because one of my members didn't show up."

Alicia: "That's terrible." *She spoke as if someone was hurt, stopping next to Lance.*

Lance: *He smiled at Alicia, focusing his attention on Simone.* "Simone, this is Alicia.. Alicia, Simone."

Alicia: "H-Hello, nice to meet you."

Simone: "And you too-"

Lance: "Now, we don't have much time."

Simone: "Yes?"

Lance: "To be a great manager, you need to be one of two things-" *He spoke in a mature manner and grunted, putting the apron over his head.* "You need to be compassionate and stern. You aren't stern enough."

Simone: (Stern?)

Lance: "Now, I'm goin' to have to show authority to the customers, but, by not bein' rude either."

Simone: "I-Is that possible?"

Lance: "Once I focus on the front, I need to assist the back. I noticed the person cooking is going way too slow."

Simone: "I was meant to be helping, but I was forced on front to deal with the complaints-"

Lance: "Simone, you're on front with me, Alicia help the person at the back-"

Alicia: "I-I wouldn't know what to do?!" *She squeaked and started to panic, causing Lance to rub her cheek for comfort.*

Lance: "It's fine. You'll be assisting the person, I believe in your abilities."

Alicia: "O-Okay-" *She nervously nodded her head, sighing with low confidence.*

Lance: "Let's go-" *He took a deep breath and stepped into the booth, causing Simone and Alicia to follow.*

----------

PKMY: *She walked out of the castle, looking at Freya on her shoulder.* (We're seriously not in a good position right now, how was it possible to disable teleportation?)

Freya: "Gerooh?" *She squeaked in confusion, trying to be supportive.*

PKMY: *She grunted in frustration.* (Why am I frustrated?)

Holland: "Hey!" *The doors rippled around him as he ran outside towards PKMY.*

PKMY: "Holly?" *She turned around and looked confused.*

Freya: "Gruff!" *She squeaked, happy to see Holland.*

PKMY: "What are you doing here?"

Holland: "I've got good news-"

PKMY: "They've found the Consultant's location?!" *She whispered to herself in shock.*

Holland: "Ah, yeah, haha."

PKMY: *She formed a fist, staring at Holland with a widening smile.* "This is excellent-"

Holland: "So, want to come with me to-?"

PKMY: "Tell Lance and Alicia?"

Holland: "Yeah, I want to see Lance's expression once he finds out."

PKMY: "You find its face funny too?"

Holland: "Amy." *He spoke to her as if she was being mean.*

PKMY: "Wateva."

Freya: "Grr." *She growled at Holland, causing PKMY to chuckle.*

Holland: "Why you on her side? She was being mean."

Freya: "Growlith!" *She squeaked with a wagging tail.*

PKMY: "Heh."

Holland: "Haha."

----------

Cameron: "Do not be ridiculous, the legend?"

Dawn: "What else would explain the destruction of almost all the shops and boats?"

Chrisma: "Legend?"

Joy: "Surely you haven't forgotten, Chrisma?"

Tyler: "I vaguely remember reading something about a legend regarding The Skyler's Isle."

Season: *He discreetly rubbed his temples in a frustrated manner.* (I don't have time for this-)

Tyler: "But I don't recall what the actual legend was?"

Dawn: *She looked at Cameron, pushing her glasses up with three fingers.* "I don't believe in legends either, only facts that are right in front of me."

Cameron: "I agree."

Season: "Someone wishes to explain why there're no ships or boats available?"

Dawn: "For research, I'm quite surprised you don't know, Season."

Season: "Perhaps I don't bore myself with such legends, I'm a ruler, not a fantasy chaser."

Dawn: "..."

Tyler: *He discreetly smirked and coughed to clear his throat, looking at each party member.* "What's the legend about?"

Joy: "The legend states of a mythical serpent that divides the continents. It's said, that when creatures are brought to bring destruction towards the ocean, it shows itself."

Tyler: "Creatures?"

Joy: "Being humans, Scoldrants, the lot."

Tyler: "I see."

Season: *He noticed Dawn shaking her head.* "What are your thoughts?"

Dawn: "I've thought of a possible realistic scenario."

Joy: "Let us hear it?" *She unintentionally sounded annoyed, due to Dawn's lack of courtesy.*

Chrisma: (Back home, we celebrate legends and old tales, so I can understand how Joy feels-)

Dawn: *She looked at Joy, nodding her head.* "The pulse, it might have caused something along the lines of a tidal wave-"

Chrisma: "A tidal wave?"

Tyler: "Caused by the same strange pulse that originated from Surpreon?" *He looked at Dawn for clarification.*

Dawn: "Exactly right. Due to the strength of the pulse, it's possible it negatively reacted to naturally formed pockets of Astragons-"

Tyler: "Ah, I see! It's almost like a different variant of the seismic disturbance at the bottom of the ocean." *He mumbled to himself as if he was agreeing with Dawn's hypothesis.*

Dawn: "And that pulse is what obviously caused damage to the boats."

Cameron: "That is a more believable point of view on the subject."

Joy: "..."

Tyler: "We skipped where the conversation was leading, what's the problem?"

Dawn: "We just explained it, the lack of ships to set sail."

Tyler: "Oh-" *His face went red.*

Season: *He looked at Cameron with an idea.* "Is it possible to ride an airborne Scoldrant?"

Cameron: "It is a possibility, but the consumption of time would be the issue."

Season: (Blast it-)

Joy: "There is a way." *She spoke hesitantly.*

Dawn: "Hmm?"

Season: "Well, speak of it?"

Joy: "There's a party of bandits with powerful Rosterology items and several devices installed on their vessel. I'm confident their ship would have survived."

Dawn: "How would you be so sure?"

Joy: "In the past, it withstood several of my own Remenistal before sailing away."

Chrisma: "Them!" *She clicked her fingers, groaning in recollection.*

Tyler: *He quickly leant back from Chrisma, instinctively covering his face in fright.* (Ah?)

*Tyler slowly lowered his arm, ensuring nobody saw his reaction.*

Tyler: (That's a little embarrassing, did I just display signs of operant conditioning..? Probably from the paintballing incident-)

Chrisma: "Are you talking about the same bandits that stole some of the neighbouring village's currency?"

Joy: *She silently nodded her head.* "And, they reside in the entertainment section of Silver Wind Island."

Tyler: "Where's that?"

Season: "Dawn?"

Dawn: *She noticed Season, Tyler and Cameron looking at her for a response.* "I don't know."

Cameron: "You do not know?"

Dawn: "I've rarely been to the entertainment area."

Tyler: "Rarely?"

Dawn: "Even though I've been in this city my entire life, yes, rarely."

Chrisma: *She slowly looked to her side, staring at Joy in curiosity.* "How would you know that?"

Joy: "Don't think too much of it, I merely heard them talk before they fled."

Season: "Then I'll personally make a visit to these bandits. Where is this entertainment area?"

Dawn: "That's assuming they're even there, to begin with."

Season: "Where was it sorry?"

Dawn: *She sighed.* "It's on the third level of the city, across any one of the bridges."

Tyler: "How will you know which building to look in?"

Dawn: "There're four main areas. One is the infamous Guild's Silver Tavern."

Tyler: (Guilds? Silver Tavern?) *He spoke in thought, triggering a flashback of when he first met Lezard.* (That place was scary-)

Dawn: "Next is The Hall of Oats, then there's the currency area but research and I usually just consult whoever's free in The Financial Guild. Lastly, you have the entertainment dome."

Season: "Excellent, I'll go at once-"

Joy: "Would it be wise to go?"

Dawn: *She nodded her head again, intensely staring at Season.* "I've seen a lot of patients in the ward a few levels below from that part of the city."

Season: "Excuse me?"

Joy: "They are bandits from a questionable guild-"

Season: "I'm sure I can hold my own."

Cameron: "I will assist you."

Season: "If you desire."

Cameron: "Indeed."

Season: "Tyler, do you wish to come too?"

Tyler: "Th-That's fine-" *He shook his head, respectfully declining Season's offer.* "I'll probably go look for Holland, PKMY, Lance and Alicia, they should be back by now."

Chrisma: "I'd like to come!" *She walked up to Season, ignoring his answer.*

Season: ".. Sure?"

Joy: (Sorry, Season. I don't think you had a choice.)

Chrisma: "Whoup whoup." *She tugged on her robes, standing next to Season.*

Dawn: "..." *She stared at the party with a blank facial expression, catching their attention.*

Cameron: "Is there more information necessary for completing this quest?" *He spoke in curiosity, trying to understand her facial expression.*

Dawn: *She sighed, shaking her head.* "You have a plan, why are you all rotting in my research facility?!"

Season: *He smiled in understanding, quickly facing the doorway.* "Right, we'll be back shortly-"

Madora: "The mistress, oh, her power is infinite." *She caught Joy and Dawn's attention.*

Dawn: *She looked across the facility and snapped her fingers, catching the attention of two researchers in white.* "I want you two to run a diagnostic scan!"

Researchers: "Ma'am!"

Dawn: "For research!-"

Chrisma: "For research! Whoup whoup." *She fist punched the air before Dawn, causing Tyler to face palm.*

Dawn: "..."

Joy: *She ignored Chrisma and rubbed Madora's arm, sighing in thought.* (Hopefully, we'll find out what's wrong with you.)

----------

Lance: (By recognising each crew member, it will make them feel of individual value, which will also boost morale and productivity-)

*Lance walked into the kitchen and observed the staff member and the foods, causing him to discreetly smile in relief.*

Lance: (Excellent, they have all the right foods for me to make it-)

*Simone and Alicia closely shuffled behind Lance as if it was their first day on the job.*

Staff Member: "Nobody is telling me what burgers are special or what are normal." *He spoke to himself in a flustered manner, trying to make multiple sandwiches and burgers at once.*

Lance: *He stared at the flustered man dressed in chef's clothes, noticing the sandwiches and burgers on the production line.* "Hello, my name is Lance and I'll be working with you."

Staff Member: *He paused and looked up to Lance, confused by his presence.* "Hello?"

Lance: "This is Alicia, she'll be assisting whatever you need until I come back out."

Staff Member: "O-Okay-" *He nodded his head and focused back on making sandwiches.*

Lance: "Alicia-" *He stepped to the side, motioning his hand towards the staff member.*

Alicia: *She adjusted an apron over her shoulders and walked up to the staff member.* "What would you like me to do?"

Staff Member: *He pointed to an empty lettuce container, drawing Alicia's attention towards it.* "Could you please-"

Lance: "Simone-" *He started to walk towards the front of the booth, causing her to quickly follow.*

Simone: "Y-Yes-?"

Lance: "I'll be preparing somethin' of my own likin'."

Simone: "Of your own liking?"

Lance: "If it sells well to the customers, you're free to use it." *He walked behind the counter, instantly catching the customers' attention.*

Simone: "Umm, okay?" *She sounded confused, following Lance into the customers' line of sight.*

Woman: *She stared at Lance and leant on one side, shaking her head in disappointment.* "A new face? How about you serve us?"

Man: "Yeah!" *He shouted from behind the line, causing the woman to smirk evil-like.*

Lance: "We are sorry for the inconvenience, but we were down several staff members. We have corrected the error and will be serving-"

Woman: "Don't give us that crap, we heard it from her several times!-"

Simone: *She lowered her head feeling guilty.* (How is he going to fix-?)

Lance: "We appreciate the constructive feedback."

Woman: "Just make me my food!-"

Lance: "Obviously complaining will cause us to delay giving you the requested service furthermore."

Woman: "Well-" *She looked around at nearby customers, trying to gain moral support.*

Lance: "If that is all, please excuse me. Due to the inconvenience, we will be serving burgers that taste like they were made from another planet!"

Simone: *She glanced at Lance, staring at him in shock.* (Wow...)

Woman: "A-Another planet? Pfft-" *She looked unimpressed and folded her arms, glaring at Lance in a competitive manner.* "-I'd like to try this."

Simone: *She walked up to the counter and leant towards Lance, whispering under her breath.* "What are these burgers called?"

Lance: "Umm-" *He thought to himself, trying to think of a name.*

Woman: *She started to tap her feet, readying herself to shout at Lance and Simone.* "Hurry up..."

Lance: (Ash... These management skills, you taught me them.) *He tightened his hands and sighed, nodding his head in satisfaction.*

Simone: (Am I that desperate that I'm going to let him create his own food?) *She sighed with worry and anxiety.* "Lance?"

Lance: "Oh, umm, call them Fast Lawyers." *He waved his arm as if he was done with the conversation and turned around, walking away from the counter.*

Simone: *She watched Lance leave her sight, causing her to cough with higher morale.* "Ahem. Who wishes to purchase, a burger like no other!? The Fast Lawyers!"

Woman: *She over-dramatically ground her teeth, glaring at Simone.* "I'll be the first to have one of those fast burgers! If they aren't up to my expectations, I'll be throwing it in your face!"

Simone: "R-Right away-" *She slightly nodded her head, trying to hide her intimidation.*

Lance: *He walked into the back and put on gloves, catching the staff member and Alicia's attention.* "Alicia, could you please assist Simone at the front?"

Alicia: "R-Right-" *She sighed in relief, quickly and happily taking off the gloves.* (I don't like it in here-)

Lance: "Alright, I'd like to show you the special way in creating the Fast Lawyers."

Staff Member: "Fast Lawyers?" *He looked at Lance in confusion, giving him his full attention.*

Lance: "They're a new burger, you'd be surprised which ingredients compliment each other."

Staff Member: "Alright." *He nodded his head and smiled in excitement as if he was willing to learn.*

Lance: "Firstly-" *He reached over the production line, grabbing a large bun.*

----------

*PKMY, Holland and Freya stood in a clustered triangular formation on the road-like path.*

Holland: "So, let's find Lance and Alicia and tell them the good news too?"

PKMY: "Yea, I dunno."

Freya: *She looked up, staring at PKMY in confusion.* "Gruff?"

PKMY: "It would be a waste of time."

Holland: "Waste of time?"

PKMY: "We could be following up on the data now." *She looked past Holland, pointing at the castle.*

Holland: "We're a party, we don't keep that stuff to ourselves."

PKMY: *She lowered her arm, looking down to Freya.* "Wat do you think?"

Freya: "Ruff!" *She looked at Holland, wagging her tail in agreement.* (Let's find them!)

PKMY: "OK-"

Holland: "Alright-" *He smiled and scanned across the city with heightened vision.*

PKMY: (It's not like I don't tell my party members.. It's just, we can't afford to waste any more time.)

Holland: "Where are they?" *He mumbled to himself, squinting his eyes.*

Freya: "Grruff-" *She sniffed the air and looked to each side in confusion, whimpering with failure.* (The smell of all these foods confuse me. I can't track his scent.)

Holland: "That's okay, I can't see them either. It's too busy-"

PKMY: "Heh, my turn-" *She slowed her breathing and closed her eyes, causing different sounding voices to echo in her head.*

Holland: *He looked down the path and noticed a massive line of customers, queueing from one market.* "What's with that peculiar market which makes it so popular?"

*Holland mumbled and pondered to himself, staring at the line of customers.*

PKMY: *Her eye twitched in deep thought.* (It's a struggle to read where he is-)

Holland: "Hey, Amy.. I know the city is big, but it wouldn't be that hard to find them."

PKMY: *She opened her eyes in a defeated manner, looking up to Holland.* "Well, they're not a big ogre like you-"

Holland: "Oh be quiet and let's look for them." *He smirked and walked directly towards the crowd.*

Freya: "Gruff!" *She trotted by Holland's side, closely observing the people around her.*

PKMY: "Heh-" *She shook her head and turned around, walking with Holland.*

--

Lance: "Done-" *He wrapped a completed burger in newspaper and presented it to the staff member.*

Staff Member: (Fast-)

Lance: "And that's how you make it." *He looked to the side, placing the burger on a heat tray.*

Staff Member: *He nodded his head with a smile.* "Alright-" (I've never seen those ingredients being used together like that before-)

Lance: "Fast Lawyers up!"

Alicia: "U-Umm-" *She quickly turned around and grabbed the burger-shaped object.*

Woman: "About time-"

Alicia: *She walked up to the impatient woman, cautiously handing the burger over.* "H-Here-"

Woman: *She snatched the burger from Alicia and shuffled to the end of the counter.* "I'll see if these are really what you promised-"

Simone: *She noticed the line of customers, focusing all their attention to the woman.* (It's like they're waiting for her response-)

Woman: *She ripped the paper around the burger, looking at it in disgust.* "What kind of ingredients are on here?!"

Simone: "..."

Alicia: "Is she going to eat it on the counter?"

Simone: "I don't know-" *She whispered, staring at the woman with anticipation.* (Please, just go away...)

Woman: *She took a large bite and chewed it like a cow.* "Hermm."

*The line of customers quietly waited in suspense for her response.*

Alicia: "W-Why is she eating right there?" *She whispered to Simone who shrugged her shoulders.*

Woman: *She gasped and looked at the burger in disgust.* "This..."

Simone: (Oh no-)
Alicia: "Eep."

Man: *He leant forward, staring at the woman in a curious manner.* "Isn't it good?"

Woman: "There is a party in my mouth!?"

Man: "A party?"

Alicia: "In her mouth?"

Woman: "Moar!" *She rammed the burger into her mouth and scoffed it down while making unusual sounds.*

Simone: *She stared at the woman in a strange-like manner, quietly whispering to Alicia.* "I hope all the customers don't do that."

Alicia: "Tee hee."

*The woman's reaction caused the impatient customers to become excited, catching Simone's attention.*

Simone: "W-What-?"

Man: "I-I want to try this new burger! I'll take three Fast Lawyers please!" *He hit the counter in excitement, presenting gold and silver coin-like pebbles.*

Simone: "Three c-coming up-" *She hid her excitement, typing on a register-like console.*

Alicia: *She faced the back, biting her bottom lip with a smile.* "Three Fast Lawyers please!"

Lance: "Coming up!"

Staff Member: *He nodded his head and grabbed three burger buns.* "Another burger already?"

Lance: "I expect to only sell them, so, before your shift finishes, you'll be a master at it."

Staff Member: "Herrherr, thanks."

----------

*Joy and Dawn watched several researchers use Rosterology devices to scan Madora, resonating a slight humming sound.*

Madora: "Glowing, weee, wooo, pooo." *She giggled like a child, keeping a fixated stare on the Rosterology devices.*

Joy: *She stared at Madora, humming in a worried manner.* (It's been a while-)

*The Rosterology devices stopped glowing, causing Dawn to focus her attention to the researchers.*

Madora: "Sounds and glowing gone, sad sad."

Dawn: "It's done, well?" *She sounded impatient, glaring at each researcher.*

Joy: "Any luck?"

Dawn: "Research waits for no person! Tell me now!"

Researcher: "From what we gathered, she has no mental illness. She has no signs of Neuron build-up-" *He spoke nervously, looking at a miniature screen on the device he held.*

Joy: "What are you saying?"

Researcher: "By these scanners, she's completely fine-"

Dawn: "Does she look fine to you?! We'll have to keep scanning until we find what the problem is!"

Researchers: "Ma'am!"

----------

*Season, Cameron and Chrisma walked up the stairs to the third level, ignoring the large line of customers.*

Cameron: "What exactly do you intend to ask these bandits?"

Season: "Exactly what I need of them, to ask if we can use their vessel-"

Chrisma: "W-What if they try to attack us?!" *She groaned in a worried manner, tugging on her robes.*

Cameron: *He formed and tightened a fist, smirking in a confident manner.* "That possible outcome will not even be of concern."

Season: "My thoughts exactly, Cameron." *He spoke with a smile and walked onto a bridge, noticing the change of tone in his footsteps.*

Chrisma: (Big strong boys.) *She giggled in thought, walking with the party across the bridge.*

Cameron: "This place is quite big."

Season: "Oh?" *He glanced at Cameron as if he wasn't expecting him to say that.* "Sorrowprax is quite large too."

Cameron: "That is a fact. Although, it is the feeling of this city."

Season: "I know what you mean."

Cameron: (He has been to Sorrowprax before?)

Apollo: (Or maybe he knows its structure from the information of his research facilities?) *His voice echoed in Cameron's head.*

Cameron: (Perhaps-) *He walked off the bridge, noticing the change of tone in his footsteps.*

Chrisma: "Wow, get in! Speaking about a different feeling, check this area out?" *She groaned on her breath, noticing differently coloured tiles on the floor.*

Cameron: *He looked down, nodding his head in agreement.* "There is indeed a visible change in scenery."

Season: *He observed the area, mumbling in thought.* (I actually get the vibe of those adult orientated villages-)

Chrisma: "Ooh!" *She heard a faint beat to a dance song, causing her to rock her bottom.*

Season: *He aimlessly walked around, noticing an expansion of alleyways which led towards massive buildings.* (This is like another city in itself!-)

Cameron: *He noticed an enormous wooden building with five flags posted on the front.* "Despite being two-storey high, it appears to have the same architectural structure as a tavern."

Chrisma: "The Guild's Tavern!" *She groaned in realisation, looking at Cameron for compliments.*

Cameron: "Indeed. The Guild's Silver Tavern."

Season: *He placed a finger under his chin in thought, observing the wooden structure.* "I wonder what gave it the name silver?"

Chrisma: "Yeah! You crazy git-" *She enthusiastically groaned in agreement, pointing at the tavern like a child.* "It doesn't look silver to me either!"

Season: "And what are those flags for?"

Chrisma: "Decorative purposes?"

Season: "I don't know."

Cameron: "I recall on one mission, I was fighting a band of guilds.. The flags represent the five best guilds across the land."

Season: "Oh?" *He sounded interested, watching the differently designed flags flap without the aid of wind.*

Cameron: "They say, the strongest guild is said to be as strong as a number two captain."

Chrisma: "Get in..."

Cameron: (But, the Consultants may have been lying about that too..)

Season: *He shook his head as if he was getting distracted and focused his attention on his surroundings.* "I haven't been here myself, where exactly would these bandits reside?"

Cameron: "There are four main areas-" *He scanned across the area, shaking his head in confusion.* "Yet, there are still many houses?"

Season: *He noticed several pirate-like thugs walking down a secluded alley, catching his attention.* "Hermm."

Chrisma: *She quickly faced Season, watching him stroke his chin in thought.* "Hermm? Hermm what?"

Cameron: "Focus on the task at hand." *He glanced at Chrisma before focusing his attention to Season.*

Season: "He's right."

Chrisma: "Oh.."

Cameron: "Move out." *He stealthily led the party towards the alley and stopped in front of a house, resting his back along the wall.*

Season: "Hmm-?" *He peaked down the alley and noticed several buildings with flashing lights around them.*

Cameron: "Well?"

Season: *He nodded his head in confirmation.* "That's got to be it."

Cameron: *He peaked over Season, staring at a warehouse-like door with graffiti on the walls.* "Are you certain?"

Season: "From experience, trust me."

Chrisma: *She bent at the knees and looked down the alley, noticing the lights.* "Flashing lights?"

Cameron: *He leant back and rested against the wall, glancing at Season.* "It would be wise not to make a fuss or go in too stealthily. As both will draw unwanted attent-"

Chrisma: "Look at them flash!? Whoup whoup-" *She ran down the alley with her arms swaying above her.*

Season: *He face palmed and rubbed his hand down his face, glancing at Cameron.* "Next plan?"

Cameron: "Follow her before she recklessly enters one of the-" *He watched Chrisma slam open the door, causing music to loudly echo.*

Chrisma: *Lights flashed on her face, causing her to smile in awe.* "Get. In-" *She slowly shuffled inside, closing the door behind her.*

Season: (Is that woman serious!?)

Cameron: "If our target resides around here, there is a high probability that all the bandits will gather together, into one large party."

Season: "Into one large party.. Wouldn't they just gather in the guild's tavern?"

Cameron: *He shook his head, glancing at Season.* "Bandits usually gather together."

Season: "How would you know?"

Cameron: "Experience. Trust me."

Season: "Hoho, number one business?"

Cameron: *He nodded his head.* "Nevertheless, Chrisma will not stand a chance."

Season: "You're right, let's not waste time-"

Cameron: "Hmph-" *He grunted in agreement and stealthily jogged down the alley, intensely staring at the building Chrisma entered.*

Season: *He discreetly peaked around the corner, staring at Cameron's back.* (Chrisma, how reckless.)

Cameron: (I sense two beings with Remenistal, the rest either do not have enough Neurons or Astragons for me to pick up their signatures..)

*Cameron stopped and looked behind him to Season, motioning his hand to come over.*

Season: *He stepped into the alley, quickly walking towards Cameron in a cautious manner.* (He's like a male version of Teresa-)

----------

*Simone and Alicia stared at several customers moaning with pleasure as they chewed on the burgers.*

Simone: "Next?"

Teenager Girl: "I want seven Fast Lawyers!"

Alicia: "Seven this time!" *She yelled out to the back, causing Lance to nod his understanding.*

Lance: "G-Got it-"

*Lance and the staff member furiously placed ingredients on the burgers at a fast pace.*

Staff Member: "I don't know about you, but I'm getting tired." *He spoke without losing his burger making speed.*

Lance: "I was expecting things to go well, but, the number of orders, not only the orders, but each order is far too much with the current labour we have-"

Man: "Could I please get nine Fast Lawyers?!"

Simone: "R-Right-"

Alicia: "Another nine please!" *She yelled over her shoulder as she handed out three bags full of burgers.*

Lance: "R-Right."

*Holland, PKMY and Freya stared at a woman attempting to shove three burgers into her mouth at once.*

PKMY: *She coughed in disgust, unintentionally motioning her mouth in a chewing-like manner with the woman.* "Wat the-?"

Tyler: "Hey! Found you three-" *He jogged up to the party with a slight pant, instantly noticing their strange faces.* "W-What's wrong?" *He nervously looked around, holding onto his RPG bag.*

Holland: "I know I like foods, but-"

PKMY: "That's pretty feral."

Holland: "Yeah."

Freya: "Gerooh." *She whined in agreement.*

Tyler: "Huh?" *He looked to his side and noticed the burgers, giving him a flashback of Chrisma eating at Fast Food Enterprise.*

Holland: *He observed the line of customers and leant to the side, looking at Tyler.* "It seems there's a new food that apparently-"

Tyler: "I know this burger?"

PKMY: "Eh?"

Holland: "You do?"

Tyler: "The smell-" *He spoke under his breath, causing Freya to growl in curiosity.*

Freya: (Not even I recognise this smell-)

Tyler: "I didn't notice it at first, but this smell-" *He walked closer to the crowd of customers, noticing Alicia.* "Hey, it's Alicia."

PKMY: *She slowly followed Tyler, observing the queue of customers.* "In the line?"

Holland: "I don't see her-"

Tyler: "No, she's behind the counter."

PKMY: "Eh?"
Holland: "Huh?"

Tyler: "What's she doing there?" *He mumbled to himself, walking towards the counter.*

*Tyler, Holland, PKMY and Freya clustered near the counter, catching Alicia's attention.*

Alicia: "H-Hello everyone-" *She spoke with a smile as she handed out another four bags to two different customers.*

PKMY: "Wat are you doing!?" *She hissed in confusion.*

Simone: "How could I help you?"

Man: "Yes, can I get-"

Simone: *She noticed Holland and smiled.* (There's that man again-)
Man: "-That's all."

Simone: *She focused back to the customer.* "I'm very sorry, what was that?"

Man: "Five Fast Lawyers please."

Simone: "Of course, Alicia?"

Alicia: "Five Fast Lawyers."

Lance: "Got it!-"

Holland: "Was that Lance?" *He mumbled in confusion, causing PKMY to shake her head in confusion.*

PKMY: "We leave for five minutes and here they are running a damned booth?!"

Tyler: *He quickly looked at PKMY.* "Please keep the noise level down."

PKMY: "Eh? Did he really just-?"

Holland: (Amy.)

PKMY: *She sighed, rolling her eyes.* (Fine... Only because I know what you're feeling.)

Old Woman: "Could I get two Fast Lawyers please?"

Simone: "Two Fast Lawyers, sure thing."

Alicia: "Another two Fast Lawyers please."

Lance: "Got it!"

Alicia: "Also, Tyler, PKMY, Holland and Freya are here."

Lance: *He looked up in relief.* "Send them at the back!"

Alicia: *She packed another bag of burgers and quickly looked at the party.* "Lance-"

Tyler: "We heard him." *He smiled, nodding his head at Alicia.*

Alicia: "R-Right." *She walked forward and leant over the counter, handing the bag to a teenage girl.* "Have a nice day."

Lance: "I will be back in a moment, I've got more help coming."

Staff Member: *He sighed in relief, wiping his forehead with his arm.* "That sounds great!"

Lance: "Aha, yea." *He quickly took off the gloves and power walked through the small kitchen.*

----------

*Brazza stood on the edge of a cliff and smelt the air, looking down to crashing waves below.*

Brazza: "Ah? So you made it." *He mumbled in a deep voice, watching Pickles flashstep by his side.*

Pickles: *She stepped forward and stared out into the ocean, breathing out a stream smoke-like mist.* "Yeah, anyone else?"

Brazza: "Doesn't look it." *He sighed under his breath as if he didn't care.*

Pickles: "Maybe that's a good thing with the way those two acted towards killing."

Brazza: "Hmph." *He looked to his side, raising his eyebrows with a smile.* "How did it go with your opponent?"

Pickles: "She was a powerful ice Remenistal User."

Brazza: "Mine was lightning too."

Pickles: "Did you kill yours?"

Brazza: "No, you?"

Pickles: *She shook her head, waving green hair out of her face.* "What are we going to do now?"

Brazza: "Don't think the Consultant would want us to return in failure."

Pickles: "So... We're free?"

Brazza: "Yeah, looks like it, hmph." *He smiled, focusing his attention back to the water.*

Pickles: "Naice."

Brazza: "Dunno about you, but I think I know what I want to do."

Pickles: "I've got the freedom to make my choices-"

Brazza: "What're you blabbering on about."

Pickles: *She shook her head with a smile.* "My choice, I'm pretty certain what I want to do with it."

Brazza: *He smirked, raising an eyebrow in curiosity.* "We're on the same page?"

Pickles: "Looks like it."

Brazza: "Before we say hello, should we live life to the fullest?"

Pickles: "No regrets?"

Brazza: "Hmph, yeah."

Pickles: "What to do first?"

Brazza: "I dunno, anything that's not boring."

Pickles: "Let's check out our heritage, The Lost City and where the Elementalists were last seen."

Brazza: "Sounds good." *He bent his knees, readying to flashstep.*

Pickles: "I'm a little tired from my fight still, walk?"

Brazza: "'Kay then." *He smirked and formed a fist, causing a swirl of red lightning to static around it.* "Who was your opponent?"

Pickles: "She was a little ditzy and liked repeating everything I said."

Brazza: "Everything you said, huh?"

Pickles: "Yeah, like a parrot."

Brazza: "Like a parrot?"

Pickles: "Yeah, it was a little annoying."

Brazza: "Annoying?"

Pickles: *She looked at Brazza, smiling in realisation.* "Naice." *She nodded her head in an impressed manner, slowly walking away from the cliff.*

Brazza: "Hah."

Pickles: "Yours?" *She spoke without looking back.*

Brazza: *He looked over his shoulder, staring at Pickles.* "The dude I was fighting, he was a hybrid."

Pickles: "A hybrid?"

Brazza: "Yeah, Remenistal and Elementalist." *He spoke in a deep voice and turned around, following Pickles.*

Pickles: "Not possible."

Brazza: "Shush, I'm not lying."

Pickles: "Tell me more."

Brazza: *He rocked his head, flicking hair out of his face.* "After you tell me more about this ditzy parrot."

Pickles: "Raight." *She silently chuckled, walking into a forest.*

----------

Lance: *He walked out the back, noticing the party cluttering around him.* "Hey-"

PKMY: "Wat's going on here? You left the castle to work in this filthy crap hole?"

Tyler: "Fast Food Enterprise?"

Holland: "What is that delicious smell?" *He twiddled his fingers in excitement.*

Freya: *She sniffed the air, wagging her tail.* (This new aroma does smell extraordinary!)

Lance: "Whoa, settle down everyone, aye-"

PKMY: "We're confronting the Consultant, we don't have time to do this shit!"

Tyler: "..."

Lance: "Well-"

Staff Member: "Lance?" *He shouted from the kitchen, catching the party's attention.*

PKMY: (Whoever it was sounded stressed, not that I care-)

Lance: "Right, we better hurry because the orders are going to stack up. Can you three help me?"

PKMY: "Are you joking?" *She leant to one side, folding her arms in a competitive manner.* "Wat's in it for us?"

Lance: "Holland, you get to eat the burgers after we finish!"

Holland: "I'm sold-"

Lance: *He noticed Freya and looked up to Holland.* "But Freya won't be allowed in, it's not acceptable practice."

Holland: *He respectfully nodded his head.* "Freya?"

Freya: "Grr-" *She frizzed her fur and growled at Lance before disintegrating into nothing.*

Lance: "Sorry-"

Holland: *He raised his hand in understanding.* "You're right."

Lance: "Kool-" *He pointed towards the booth, causing Holland to look inside.* "The staff member preparing food will ask what he would like you to do."

Holland: "Got it-" *He walked past Lance and into the booth.*

Lance: "Fast Food Enterprise, Tyler?" *He spoke with a cocky smirk, knowing Tyler couldn't refuse his offer.*

Tyler: "So?"

Lance: "Aye?" *He grunted in a surprised manner.*

Tyler: "My life is here now-"

Lance: "Then did you want to support the new burger, Fast Lawyers? In Ashton's honour."

Tyler: *He chuckled in respect and silently nodded his head.* "Yeah, I'll do that, for a worthwhile cause."

Lance: "And.. Ah-?" *He slowly looked at PKMY, unsure what to say.*

PKMY: "How about asking me nicely for starters!"

Lance: *He tried to hide his frustration, causing PKMY to smirk.* "Could you.. Please-" *He grumbled the last word, scratching his nose.*

PKMY: (Heh-)

Lance: "-Help us out?"

Tyler: *He looked at Lance and pointed to the booth, awkwardly shuffling towards it.* "I'm going inside now-" *He mumbled, quickly stepping inside.*

Lance: *He stared at PKMY, slightly frowning with anticipation.* "So, watchya say?"

PKMY: "Well-" *She looked to each side, sighing in a defeated manner.* "-I'm not going to walk to the castle by myself."

Lance: "So, that's a..?"

PKMY: "Yes, you dumb-arse."

Lance: "I'm no dumbass-"

PKMY: "Wat you want me to do, dumb-arse?"

Lance: *He rolled his eyes and sighed, picking his nose like a child.* "I want you at the front with Alicia and Simone."

PKMY: "Tssk-"

Lance: "Wat is it?"

PKMY: "Simone looks like someone I wouldn't usually hang out with-"

Lance: "You both have red hair, you two will become best friends-"

PKMY: *She leant forward, suddenly punching Lance in the face.* "Oops, my red hair got in the way, heh." *She smirked and stormed inside the booth.*

Lance: (Man, dunno if I'm cut out for this.) *He rubbed his nose, watching PKMY walk through the booth.*

*Lance sighed and sniffed, listening to the busy-like chatter from the people in the city.*

Lance: (Sounds like it's getting busier-) *He frowned in thought, walking inside the booth towards a sink.* (It must be nearing lunchtime.)

*Lance slowly inhaled and sighed deeply, readying to wash his hands.*

----------

Cameron: *He watched Season reach for the graffiti-covered door.* (Apollo, be prepared to be summoned in tight quarters.)

Apollo: (Yes!)

Season: "..." *He casually opened the door and stepped inside, instantly being disorientated by coloured lights and loud music.*

Cameron: *He followed Season, squinting his eyes in disorientation.* "What-?"

Season: *He looked up, watching beams of coloured lights flash in his face.* (Where is-?)

Cameron: "What is this place?" *He stared at rows of Rosterology consoles, noticing poker-like screens on them.*

Season: "I wouldn't have the faintest idea." *He shouted with his hands cupped around his mouth, ensuring Cameron could hear him.*

Cameron: "So many lights, yet, so dark?"

Apollo: (I don't like it!)

Cameron: (It is troublesome to think properly under these conditions.)

Season: *He watched crowds of people dance on a balcony-like area on the second floor.* (This place sounds like an area Tyler mentioned about Earth-)

Cameron: *He looked at Season, waving his hand across the area.* "Despite the music and lights, we must continue on to find Chrisma-"

Chrisma: "Oh, get in!" *She shouted with a groan and slapped a large man, causing Cameron and Season to look into her direction.*

Season: *He watched Chrisma giggle with a bunch of thug-like men.* "What is she doing?"

Cameron: *He stared at Chrisma with a puzzled expression.* "I have underestimated her."

Season: "How?"

Chrisma: *She felt the man's muscles, oblivious to Season and Cameron's presence.* "Get in, they're huge!"

Grunt A: "Yeearh, told ya."

Cameron: "She infiltrated unknown territory and is now speaking to someone with key knowledge that may be of use."

Season: (I don't think that's what she was doing-)

?????: "Who is this?" *A man with a long black beard stared at Season and Cameron with an unwanted frown.*

Chrisma: "Oh, shit your hairy face, look, it's my friends! Season and Cameron!"

Cameron: (Friends-?)

?????: "Hmm?" *He stroked his black beard and stood up, causing the music to stop.*

Season: *He looked around slightly worried, noticing he was the centre of attention.* (This isn't looking good-)

Cameron: *He stood in a battle-ready pose.* "On your word, I will slaughter them all." *He mumbled to Season, glancing around the room.*

?????: "What brings you to the entertainment section?"

Season: *He placed his hand in front of Cameron, symbolising him to stop.* "I thought this was available to everyone?"

?????: "It is-"

Cameron: "What is your name?"

?????: "I go by the name Whitehead." *He grunted in a pirate-like fashion, causing Season to frown with uncertainty.*

Season: (Whitehead? I haven't heard of it, but those garments, they must be the bandits' Joy was talking about.)

Chrisma: *She skipped up to Season and Cameron oblivious to the danger around them.* "Maybe you could ask Whitehead?"

Whitehead: "Ask me what?" *He grunted, stroking his feral looking beard.*

Grunt A: "Boss?" *He stood up, staring at Whitehead for instructions.*

Whitehead: "Let's hear what they got to say."

Season: "We've come to ask for information."

Whitehead: "Yeah?"

Cameron: *He stepped forward in a professional manner, catching Whitehead's attention.* "We need to talk to someone with a ship in perfect condition."

Whitehead: "You've come to the right man. My ship is sail ready, argh."

Chrisma: "Get in, for research! Whoup whoup." *She fist punched the air in excitement and glanced at Season and Cameron, waiting for their reaction.*

Cameron: "Why do you seem positive?"

Whitehead: "Argh?"

Cameron: "Ready to set sail.. How are you positive?"

Season: "Hmm.." *He looked at Whitehead, waiting for his response.*

Whitehead: "Because, when you've sailed the seas as much as I have, you pick up certain treasures along the way." *He smirked evil-like, continuing to stroke his beard.*

Season: (The vessel with Rosterology items installed, the one Joy was talking about, this is definitely our man-) "Is it possible to ask for a favour?"

Whitehead: "You want to borrow my girl?"

Cameron: "Girl?"

Season: "He means the ship-"

Chrisma: "Yes, mister Whitehead, that would be fantastic." *He groaned under her breath and wiggled her body, causing several of Whitehead's grunts to smirk in response.*

Whitehead: "Although, I don't like disappointing a pretty face-"

Chrisma: "Oh, get out." *She waved her hand in modesty.*

Whitehead: "I've got a line of customers offering many good services to use it."

Season: "What do you want in return?" *He faced Whitehead while speaking sternly.*

Whitehead: "The currency to give me and my entire crew a retirement out on the sea."

Chrisma: "Oh..." *She sounded disappointed as if she knew that wasn't possible.*

Season: "That's an absurd amount-"

Cameron: "I have never encountered such a pathetic trade." *He placed his hand over his shoulder, frowning at Whitehead in disgust.* "I will slice his-"

Season: "Cameron, I respect and appreciate your motives, but we are asking for a favour-"

Chrisma: "A trade you mean-?"

Season: "Yes, thank you, Chrisma."

Cameron: "Humph-" *He lowered his arm, controlling his violent intentions.*

Apollo: (As a number one captain, we should not be reduced to this!)

Cameron: (I agree, Apollo. But as a number one captain, we were taught respect and self-restraint.)

Apollo: (Yes..)

Season: *He looked at Whitehead, slightly bowing in respect.* "We will be back in a moment's time-"

Cameron: "But-?"

Season: *He faced the door and started to leave.* "I'm of royalty, currency is no problem to me-" *He mumbled under his breath and opened the door, filling the entrance with natural light.*

Cameron: "..." *He silently followed Season, regretting his decision.*

Chrisma: "We'll be back, boys!" *She groaned in excitement, closely following Cameron.*

Whitehead: *He stroked his beard, watching Cameron, Season and Chrisma leave the casino-like area.* "And that's how ya do business, boys!-"

*The men roared in excitement, cheering on Whitehead.*

Whitehead: "The drinks are on me!"

Grunt B: "Yeah, boss!"

----------

*PKMY and Alicia helped Simone hand out orders on the front area, watching customers leave with satisfied smiles.*

Alicia: "Another twenty-two Fast Lawyers please!"

Lance: "Twe-"

Tyler: "Twenty-two, thank you!" *He purposely spoke in a rhyme-like tone, causing Lance to pause in disgust.*

Lance: "Loser." *He grunted, shaking his head with a friendly smile.*

Tyler: *He smiled as he focused his attention on preparing the burgers.* "Ha ha."

Lance: *He watched the staff member dispense the sauces on the bun before sliding it along the line.* "Onion.. Lettuce.. Beetroot-"

Staff Member: "Beetrewt?"

Lance: "Yea, the red stuff?"

Staff Member: "Oh? Okay." *He looked at Lance as if he was crazy before placing more buns into a toaster.*

Tyler: *He smiled, sliding along wrapped burgers into the heating tray.* (I'm enjoying this, it feels really nostalgic-)

Holland: *Steam sizzled past his head as he cooked the meat and onions.* (This food is torture!) *He whimpered in thought, listening to his stomach rumble loudly.*

Freya: (Gerooh! I can smell it from here!) *She barked with an echoing tone, causing Holland to smile in understanding.*

Holland: (I didn't know you could smell from my inner-self?)

Freya: (Neither did I!) *She sounded as if she didn't want to.*

Staff Member: "I'll be back, running low on buns!"

Lance: "Got it! Make it snappy, I want to see you flashstepping!"

Staff Member: "Herrherr." *Lance's joke caused him to walk slightly faster into the stock room.*

PKMY: "Oi-" *She poked her head from the front and frowned at Lance and Tyler, waving her hand around the empty heat tray.* "Where's the food?"

Lance: "It's comin', woman!"

PKMY: "Wateva."

Lance: "Wateva your-"

Holland: "You two, come on." *He scraped the cooked onions on a tray with the meat and turned around, handing it over to Tyler.*

Lance and PKMY: "Wateva."

Tyler: "Flashstepping..." *He placed the patties on the burgers, recalling the fight they had with Shade.* "Hey, Lance."

Lance: "Hay, captain Tyler!?"

Tyler: "When could you flashstep?"

Lance: *He slid the burgers along the line and noticed PKMY prematurely snatching them before they reached the end.* "Flashstep?"

*Lance smirked like a child, purposely sliding the burgers harder than normal towards PKMY.*

PKMY: *She quickly and neatly placed the burgers on the heat tray, smirking in a competitive manner.* (That shit.)

Tyler: "When we battled that captain, you flashstepped."

Lance: "Herm-" *He looked up and thought to himself in recollection.* "I dunno, aye-"

PKMY: *She placed the burgers in bags, glancing at Tyler.* "A flashside naturally progresses into a flashstep-"

Tyler: "Oh? Interesting." *He mumbled with fascination, placing a pinch of onion on several burgers.*

Lance: "Well then, why not just say flashstep in the first place?"

Tyler: *He nodded his head in agreement, placing patties on the burgers.* (He does make a point-)

PKMY: "So, why not call crawling walking too?"

Lance: "Arh... Shuddup."

Tyler: *He nodded his head in understanding, sliding the burger along the line.* (She does have a point.)

Holland: (Freya, how does it feel to flashstep?)

Freya: *She opened her eyes in a dark area, trying to ignore the smell of the delicious burgers.* (Everything is blurred, moves in slow motion, and an indescribable wind always blows around you.)

Holland: (A wind that always blows around you? Is it the horrible feeling wind when you're ascending, or that awesome feeling when you're gliding down.)

Freya: (If I had to describe it, it would definitely be the awesome feeling.)

Holland: (Wow, sounds like something I'd want to try sometime-)

Lance: "Ogre, how're those patties going?"

Holland: "Oh-" *He scraped the spatula across the grill, flipping the patties.* "Next batch, just about ready."

PKMY: *She packed up three bags worth of burgers and grabbed one in each hand.* "Alicia-" *She turned around and shuffled towards the counter.* "Here-"

Alicia: *She turned around, noticing the bags.* "Oh, thank you."

PKMY: "No problem, princess-" *She grunted with a smirk and carefully handed the bags to Alicia, turning around to grab the other one.*

Alicia: *She faced the customer and smiled, gently placing the bags on the counter.* "Here is your order, miss-"

Woman: "Umm, I don't think these two bags have twenty-two Fast Lawyers in them!?" *She hissed, rocking her head back and forth in an intimidating manner.*

Alicia: "U-Umm-" *She nervously stuttered, looking back to see what PKMY was doing.*

PKMY: "And there you go." *She walked next to Alicia, placing the bag next to the others oblivious to what happened.*

Woman: "Good, you should've handed it to me in one go."

Alicia: "R-Right, I'll hand you all the bags at once next ti-"

PKMY: "No, what?" *She interrupted Alicia and spoke in a soft disappointing tone.*

Woman: "You heard me!"

PKMY: *Her eye twitched and she grinned evil-like.* "Oh? So, next time, we should carry three full bags with two hands?"

Woman: "Yes?! Don't you understand my speaking?" *She purposely spoke in a slow condescending manner.*

PKMY: "Alright, I'll carry the third bag in my mouth next time so I can give it to you in one go."

Alicia: *She discreetly smiled with mixed emotions.* (I shouldn't be finding this funny-)

Woman: *She slammed her hands on the counter, rolling her eyes in disgust.* "Excuse me-?!"

PKMY: "That way, you can scurry back home and stuff your face in faster!"

Alicia: "Tee hee-" *She quickly covered her mouth, looking away in a guilty manner.*

Woman: "H-Huh? Say that again-"

PKMY: "Impatient and deaf? Or maybe you've got these stupid burgers shoved in your ears too?! They're meant to go in your mouth!"

Simone: "A-Arh, Alicia-" *She spoke with restraint, trying not to laugh at PKMY telling off the customer.* "Could you please assist me?"

Alicia: "Y-Yes, of course."

----------

Chrisma: (Back in the castle-) *She sighed in thought, walking with Season and Cameron down the hallway.*

Season: (The quietness of the castle, I appreciate it even more now-) *He led the party to the end of the hallway and took a left into the research facility.*

Joy: *She stood with Dawn and several researchers, analysing the results of Madora with disappointed faces.* "Nothing..."

Dawn: *She heard the party's footsteps, causing her to turn around.* "Back already?"

Chrisma: "Hello, everyone."

Dawn: *She ignored Chrisma, looking at Season in confusion.* "Were they not in the city at this present point in time?"

Cameron: "Finding them was a success."

Dawn: "Oh?"

Chrisma: "But horrible news-" *She inappropriately groaned in mid-conversation.*

Season: "It's not horrible, I said it's not a problem."

Joy: "What is this apparent problem?"

Season: "The man of the vessel is charging us-"

Cameron: "Hermph." *He grunted with a frown, causing Dawn to look at him.*

Dawn: "Charging you..?"

Season: "He's charging us to use his ship."

Cameron: "I personally believe that is disgusting." *He looked away with an angry face.*

Dawn: "So, you're here? For what exactly?" *She looked intrigued, pushing her glasses up with two fingers.*

Season: "Receive royalties and pay the man."

Dawn: "I see where Cameron is coming from, why are you being a pushover?"

Cameron: "Precisely-" *He looked at Season, folding his arms.* "One thing the warrior system has taught me is that if you desire something of importance, you must claim it with full confidence."

Season: "I am being confident? I have confidence in my trading skills-"

Joy: "He's a bandit, he probably stole the vessel in the first place-"

Season: "Enough!" *His stern voice echoed in the facility, causing temporary silence.*

Chrisma: (Such a loud and powerful voice.) *She groaned in thought, discreetly smiling to herself.*

Season: "Firstly, don't assume he took it in the first place, secondly, we're in no position to have such a negative attitude towards this man, bandit or not."

Cameron: "..."

Season: "And lastly, with the urgency of receiving an active vessel, it is far more important than currency!" *His voice echoed in the room, giving a sense of immense rulership and power.*

Dawn: "Ahem." *She coughed and showed respect towards Season.* "If I may ask, where are you going to get said royalties?"

Season: "Surely Grey has-" *He noticed Dawn shaking her head, causing him to stop.* "What is it?"

Dawn: "The ruler's treasure is located in an unknown destination, hidden by a teleportation glyph only the ruler knows of."

Season: "O-Oh..." *His eyes widened in shock and frustration.*

Chrisma: "Then let's ask where the glyph is?"

Dawn: "We haven't been able to locate his presence."

Chrisma: "So? Wouldn't your scanners find him?" *She smiled, trying to be optimistic.*

Dawn: *She sighed, slightly face palming in frustration.* "Even if we did, teleportation glyphs are no longer active!"

Chrisma: "... Get in.."

Joy: (Chrisma..)

Season: (How ridiculous! Me having currency problems?! Now that truly upsets me.) *He slightly frowned in thought.*

Cameron: "Surely someone here has an object of value?"

Dawn: "I've got rare artefacts, Rosterology devices, crafting minerals and materials, but they're all in Grey's treasure room area thing."

Joy: "It seems we've stumbled across another problem." *She sounded upset and cupped her hands, trying to hide her stressed-like state.*

Chrisma: "What are we going to do?" *She groaned, shaking her head with uncertainty.*

Season: (Out of the entire time during our quest-) *He lowered his head in thought.* (Why did it have to be now that we encounter all these problems-?)

*A loud siren sound echoed, causing the party to cover their ears.*

Season: "What is that?!" *He tried to yell over the sirens.*

Dawn: "What?!" *She ran to a large Rosterology console and started to type, ignoring her sliding glasses.*

Joy: "W-What is it?"

Dawn: *She pushed on a key, causing the sirens to mute.* "Ahh.." *She lowered her head, sighing in relief.* "It's a warning."

Cameron: "A warning of what?" *He instinctively placed his hand over his shoulder, standing in a battle-ready pose.*

Joy: *She looked around the facility, rubbing Madora's arm in a comforting manner.* (That was unexpected.)

Madora: "Loud, loud, but not as loud as them."

Chrisma: (I'm not getting a good feeling about this..)

Dawn: "The scanners have detected hundreds of unknown signatures heading directly towards the city!" *She gasped in shock, quickly looking at the party with a serious face.*

Season: *He stared at Dawn with widening eyes.* (Just what we need, another stroke of bad luck!)

Dawn: *She looked at Cameron, noticing his warrior-like armour.* "Not to be rude, but would these enemies be warriors?"

Cameron: "Highly improbable."

----------

Staff Member: *He restocked the buns and looked around in confusion.* "Do any of you hear that?"

Holland: "Nope, all I can hear is the sizzling sounds."

Tyler: "..." *He shook his head as he silently prepared the burgers with all his concentration.*

Lance: "I do-" *He heard PKMY arguing with the customers, causing him to sigh.* "I'll be back-"

Tyler: "Right, don't be too long please."

Lance: "Wateva, your highness." *He quickly walked out of the back area, taking off his gloves.*

Tyler: "Getting low on onions!"

Holland: "Got it!"

Staff Member: "This one is with extra sauce." *He spoke in respect, sliding down the burger to Tyler.*

Lance: *He adjusted his hair and stepped onto the front, pausing in shock.* (Oh. Crap-)

*Lance watched Alicia and Simone trying to hold PKMY from jumping over the counter.*

PKMY: "You want me to break your face-?!" *She grunted in anger, waving her fist in the woman's face.*

Woman: "You shouldn't have made me wait!-" *She hissed, trying to grab the bags of burgers off the counter.*

PKMY: "Didn't your parents ever tell you not to mess with the people that make your food?!"

Woman: "Huh-?"

PKMY: "You're lucky I don't shit in your burgers and piss in your drinks!" *She shouted and tried to jump over the counter, causing Simone and Alicia to squirm.*

Alicia: "L-Lance! She's too strong-"

PKMY: "You pitiful, dirty lamp! Complain about something worthwhile! Not a damned five minute wait over burgers!"

Woman: *She slightly leant back, hiding her intimidation.* "Don't put this on me, I'm the customer! Customers are always right-"

PKMY: "I'll show you always right?! METEOR-"

Lance: "PKMY!"

PKMY: "Eh?" *She hissed at the woman, acknowledging Lance's presence.*

Woman: *She grabbed the bags and stepped away from the counter, realising she was wrong.* "W-Whatever."

PKMY: "Yea, wateva!"

Lance: "PKMY, I think you would be better at the back-"

PKMY: *She pushed herself off the counter and glared at Lance.* "You think?!"

Lance: "A-Ah-?"

PKMY: "Pfft-" *She sighed in anger, hitting Alicia and Simone's hands away.*

Simone: *She slightly leant back, hiding her fear.* (Strong! She doesn't have the power of a normal woman-)

PKMY: "Customer is always right..." *She uttered under her breath, storming towards the back.*

Lance: "Gah-" *He quickly stepped to the side as if PKMY was on fire.*

Man A: *He looked at the man behind him, nudging his head to the counter.* "The crazy red-haired girl is right."

Man B: "What about? She was the one being unprofessional."

Man A: "We shouldn't be so rude to the people that make our food."

Man B: "You're right?" *He gasped in realisation, slowly nodding his head in agreement.* "I never thought of it that way."

Teenager Girl: *She overheard the men, causing her to look over her shoulder.* "The woman had ridiculous expectations."

Man A: "Hehe, you're telling me."

Teenager Girl: "Gimme all yer bags in five minutes." *She spoke as if she was an ogre.*

Man B: "Horhor, that does sound ridiculous."

Man A: "Hehe, told you."

Lance: *He looked at Simone and Alicia, glancing at the line of customers.* "You two carry on, I'll stay out here and help."

Simone: "Alright." *She quickly regained her professional-like composure, positioning herself back on front counter.*

Alicia: "Y-Yep." *She bit her bottom lip, taking a deep breath to calm herself.*

Lance: (PKMY, that crazy little ginger-) *He sighed in thought, readying himself for orders.*

Teenager Girl: "Could I please get three Fast Lawyers?"

Simone: "Of course." *She smiled and nodded her head, acting as if nothing happened.*

Holland: *He listened to the grill sizzle and whined, staring at the patties in sadness.* (I want one so badly-)

PKMY: "If it isn't my boys, Tyler and Holland!" *She put on gloves and walked into the kitchen, catching their attention.*

Holland: (Amy.) *He smiled in thought, happy to see her.*

PKMY: "Where you want me, quick fingers?"

Tyler: "Q-Quick fingers?" *He looked at PKMY in shock as if he wasn't expecting her to know that name.*

PKMY: "You were thinking it." *She smirked, pointing at her head.*

Tyler: (No...) *He thought in despair, unsure what to say.*

PKMY: "Eh?" *She waited for Tyler's input, twiddling her fingers in the gloves.* "Wat do you want me to do?"

Tyler: "Well-"

PKMY: "Got it-" *She walked up to the assembly line next to Tyler and started to help him make burgers.*

Tyler: "A-Ah-" *He glanced at PKMY in shock, slowly nodding his head as if that's what he wanted her to do.* "That's right, thank you."

PKMY: (Heh, this is so much better than the front-)

Staff Member: *He noticed PKMY on the line, causing him to look at Tyler.* "Aren't you going to show her how to make-?"

Tyler: "She's got it." *He smiled in response, focusing his attention back to the burgers in front of him.*

Staff Member: "What?" *He looked down and noticed PKMY correctly assembling the burger in shock.* (Wow-)

PKMY: *She frowned in thought, keeping her focus on the burgers.* (Holly, what's up? You're upset.)

Holland: *He suddenly looked up in thought, flipping the patties.* (Just these burgers-)

PKMY: "Oh, don't be seeking attention like the try-hard."

Holland: "Harsh."

Staff Member: *He silently gave Holland and PKMY a strange look as he picked up another handful of buns.* (They randomly spoke. They're strange.)

PKMY: (Harsh? Only for you.) *She smirked, sliding a meatless burger to Tyler.*

Holland: (I know.) *He smiled, placing the patties onto a tray.*

*Tyler, PKMY, Holland and the staff member silently worked on completing the high demand of burgers.*

Tyler: (Me working here..) *He triggered flashbacks of working multiple shifts with Ashton, causing him to smile.* (I do miss those days sometimes.)

PKMY: *She glanced at Tyler in shock as she correctly made the burgers without looking.* (Ashton, I forgot Tyler knew him-)

Holland: "How come you got kicked back out here?"

PKMY: "So I could immaturely fart in the food?"

Tyler: "W-What?" *He snapped out of his thought, becoming aware of his surroundings.*

PKMY: *She rolled her eyes, sliding the burgers to Tyler.* "Don't worry."

Alicia: "Another eight!"

Tyler: "Eight, thank you!" *He shouted in a rhyme-like tone, causing PKMY to chuckle in disgust.* "W-What?"

PKMY: "Seriously, don't do that."

Lance: *He placed several burgers in a bag and faced the crowd of customers, gently handing the bag to Alicia.* "Here-"

Alicia: "Tee hee, grottom bottom-" *She whispered to Lance and turned around, walking up to the counter with the bag.*

Lance: (Even working at a fast food place, I still think she's beautiful.) *He smiled in thought, watching Alicia hand the bag over to the customer.* (Yep, it's official.. I'm whipped.)

Alicia: "Th-Thank you, enjoy your day." *She smiled the customer off.*

Simone: *She placed her hands on the register and smiled, readying to take the customer's order.* "How can I help you?"

Old Man: "I'd like to try a Fast Lawyers please."

Simone: "Of course."

Alicia: *She nodded her head at Simone and faced the back.* "One Fast Lawyers please!"

PKMY: "One burger, got it!" *She shouted in a casual manner, causing Tyler to sigh in disagreement.*

Tyler: "It's actually nice to say thank-"

PKMY: "And it's actually nice to shove this burger-" *She finished assembling the burger and shoved it near Tyler's face.* "Right up your-"

Tyler: "O-Okay, I get it." *He awkwardly smiled and stepped away in a defeated manner.*

PKMY: *She smirked like a child and wrapped the burger up, sliding it down the line.* "Great Tyler. Happy we sorted that out."

Tyler: "M-Me too."

Holland: (Amy..)

PKMY: (Heh.) *She glanced at Holland with a widening smirk, focusing her attention back to the assembly line.*

*Several vibrations ran along the ground, causing every citizen of Silver Wind Island to halt.*

Staff Member: *He paused, unintentionally dropping the buns in his hand.* "W-What?"

Lance: *He cleaned a bench with a cloth, waiting for more orders.* (Things seem to be running smoothly-)

Alicia: "Umm, Simone?" *She noticed all the customers standing still, causing her to look at Simone in confusion.*

Simone: "D-Did you feel that?" *She spoke slowly and quietly, catching Lance's attention.*

Lance: *He turned around, noticing everyone's strange behaviour.* "Wat's goin' on?"

PKMY: "Eh? Who's feeling that-?" *She grunted to herself in curiosity and instantly looked at the staff member, noticing his frozen statue-like pose.*

Tyler: "Why have we stopped?" *He looked down the line, noticing the staff member.*

Holland: *He looked over his shoulder, flipping another patty.* "Is something wrong?"

PKMY: (He's frozen with shock? I can feel it.)

Lance: "Aye? Feel wat?"

Simone: "Didn't you feel it?"

Alicia: "I felt faint tremors, is that what you're talking about?"

Lance: *He walked in between Simone and Alicia, shaking his head in confusion.* "The line is still big, we should serve them-"

Simone: "Those vibrations-"

Lance: "Get over the vibrations already-"

Kane: *He ran up to the booth in fright, urgently tapping on the counter.* "Sister, did you feel it?!" *Sweat dripped off his face, catching Alicia's attention.*

Alicia: "Are you ill? I can heal-"

Kane: *He unintentionally ignored Alicia, slamming his hand on the counter.* "S-Sister?"

Simone: "I-I did-"

*Several customers looked at each other with fear and confusion.*

Lance: "It's just tremors, it's nothing too bad."

*PKMY, Holland, Tyler and the staff member walked to the front, catching Lance's attention.*

Lance: "Wat are you lot doin' at the front?"

Tyler: "The orders have stopped?"

Staff Member: "And we're about to run out of buns!"

PKMY: "No more orders, that's a relief-" *She suddenly gasped in mid-sentence, causing her to spin around in shock.*

Holland: "What's up?"

PKMY: "There's a wave of uneasiness."

Alicia: "Why is everyone acting strange?"

Lance: *His eye twitched with frustration.* "Alright, wat's goin' on?! Someone tell me now!-"

Simone: "Silver Wind Island does not experience tremors, never has before."

Holland: *He shrugged his shoulders as if it wasn't a big deal.* "First time for everything?"

PKMY: "Lance, something is wrong-"

*A massive tremor rumbled the ground, causing the sky's light to dim for a moment.*

Tyler: "H-Huh?" *He looked up in shock, noticing the sky flicker in an unnatural manner.*

Alicia: "W-What is this-?!" *She bit her bottom lip, nervous cupping her pendant.*

Lance: "Wat about the cust-?" *He watched the line of customers suddenly scatter into different directions, running for refuge.*

PKMY: "This feeling-" *She held her stomach and leant forward, causing Holland to hold her up with one arm.*

Holland: (Amy?)

PKMY: (I just haven't experienced multiple emotions like this-)

Lance: "Is there a bomb scare or somethin'?"

Staff Member: *He looked at Simone in a worried manner, readying to take off his apron.* "Is it okay if I-?"

Simone: "It's fine, thank you for your good work."

Staff Member: "It's okay-" *He quickly ran out the back and took off his apron, hanging it on the wall.*

Lance: "Wha-?" *He stared in the direction of the castle and noticed Season, Cameron, Chrisma and Joy, running towards them.*

Tyler: "Is that Season and the others?"

Holland: *He squinted his eyes as the purple ring around his iris spiralled.* "Yes it is-" *He spoke in confirmation, staring at them with magnified vision.*

Alicia: "They might know what's happening?"

Lance: *He jumped over the counter and quickly glanced at Simone.* "We'll talk later, OK?"

Simone: "Of course-" *She nodded her head and took the apron off, preparing to close up the booth.* "Sure."

PKMY: "This is gotta be interesting." *She took several steps towards Lance and tapped on the ground, jumping high over the counter.*

Simone: *She looked up, watching PKMY land with ease.* (She just jumped over the counter in one motion!)

PKMY: "Season!" *She jogged towards Lance, stopping in the middle of the road-like path.*

*Alicia, Tyler and Holland took off their aprons and ran out the back.*

Tyler: *He quickly picked up the RPG bag, adjusting it over his shoulder.* (I wonder what's happening now.)

Season: "PKMY, Lance-" *He slowed down and stopped in front of them with urgency.*

PKMY: "Wat's going on?" *She snapped with anxiety, trying to ignore the feelings of the surrounding people.*

Chrisma: "The scanners went crazy in the facility!"

Lance: *He looked to his side, noticing the party run out from the back of the booth.* "Alicia, Tyler and Holland ran towards the party and gathered around them."

Alicia: *She stopped next to Lance, subconsciously holding his hand.* (I'm not sure what's happening, but I'll ensure everyone gets proper treatment.)

Lance: *He looked to his hand, noticing blue lightning spark around Alicia's hand.* (What-?!)

Alicia: *She looked at her hand, noticing mist expel from her skin in reaction to the lightning.* (Lance-?!)

Lance: *He frowned in concentration, causing the lightning and mist to fade away.* (What was that-?!)

Holland: "Did we miss something?"

PKMY: *She glanced at Lance and Alicia, frowning in curiosity.* (What was that feeling I just felt? Did their Neurons connect like a Hi-Ougi?)

Lance: *He coughed and shook his head, glancing at Holland.* "No, they're gettin' to the point right now." *He looked at Season, implying for him to talk.*

Cameron: "The scanners detected hundreds of unknown energy signatures-"

Lance: "Wat signatures?"

PKMY: "For once, will you let people finish their sentences?!"

Lance: "..." *He folded his arms and listened.*

PKMY: *She looked surprised, noticing Lance's mature-like composure.* (Eh? Nothing to say.)

Season: "Those signatures are the same as-"

*Several screeches echoed from outside the city, catching the party's attention.*

Joy: "Oh my-"

Lance: "Several Alicia-like cries were heard outside, followed by several more vibrations, which ran along the ground."

Alicia: *She gasped and listened to the screeches, triggering flashbacks of the Darkwings.* "Eek!"

Lance: "Oi, I was jokin'-"

Alicia: "Th-Those creatures."

Tyler: *He choked in realisation, intensely staring at Alicia.* "Th-The creatures made of b-bones?"

Holland: (Those creatures-) *He formed a fist.* (I won't forget them-)

PKMY: *She looked at Holland, noticing his frown.* (His uncertainty suddenly changed into determination.)

Season: "Those screeches.. It does sound like those wicked creatures."

Apollo: (I felt the signatures outside, it's the same creatures.) *His voice echoed in Cameron's head.*

Cameron: (They can not be detected, Apollo?)

Apollo: (Exactly why I know it is the same creatures.)

Cameron: *He smirked in respect, looking up to the party.* "It has been confirmed by Apollo, we are facing the same creatures."

Alicia: (Apollo?)

Lance: *He frowned in recollection, looking up to the sky.* "Where are they?"

Joy: "We were told they're heading to the city."

Chrisma: "For research, that's all we know, whoup whoup-"

*Debris suddenly exploded from the entrance of the city, instantly catching the party's attention.*

Chapter 4: Skeletal Invasion

Lance: "Wut-?"

Tyler: "Was-?"

Holland: "That?"

Chrisma: "Get in-" *She groaned in shock, unintentionally shuffling closer to Cameron.*

Season: *He stared at the growing dirt cloud with widening eyes.* (I thought the city's barrier was impenetrable-?!)

Joy: (How did something break through the city's Silver Triplets?!)

Cameron: *He faced the dirt cloud, standing in a battle-ready pose.* (Silence..)

Alicia: *She noticed several people staring at the dirt cloud with anticipation.* (If it's really those skeletal creatures, these people shouldn't-)

*Several Darkwings dived out of the dirt cloud and sprinted into different directions, causing people to scream in fear.*

Season: "This is not good! Everyone protect the city!"

Cameron: *He nodded his head and stepped forward, grunting with a disappearing image.* "Hmph-"

Season: "Everyone, split into pairs and protect each level of the city!"

PKMY: "You don't need to ask me twice! Princess, let's go."

Alicia: "H-Huh? R-Right!"

PKMY: "We'll take the third level-"

Alicia: "Uh huh-" *She eagerly nodded her head and followed PKMY, running out of the party's sight.*

Lance: "No way I'm standin' this one out, c'mon-" *He glanced at Holland, taking a few steps forward.* "We'll take the bottom."

Holland: "Yeah." *He nodded his head and ran with Lance down the road-like path.*

Season: *He looked at Joy, Chrisma and Tyler.* "Looks like we'll be defending this level!"

Joy: *She glanced behind her to the castle in the distance.* "We can't let even one of those things break through our defence."

Tyler: "Why?" *He tightly held the strap of the bag with a nervous face.*

Joy: "The castle-"

*Three Darkwings charged towards Season, Tyler, Chrisma and Joy.*

Tyler: *He shuffled in the back row, staring at the Darkwings in thought.* (There may be four of us, but this is the most important level-)

Season: *He looked to his sides, gritting his teeth in realisation.* (I won't be able to use powerful Rostical with such an enclosed environment, and so many citizens!-)

Joy: *She closed her eyes and started to sing, slightly tilting her chin up.* "Frigid stress no more hiding, release and bring upon your frozen wrath, FRIGID DISTRESS"

Chrisma: "Oh shit ya face!" *She looked at Joy and cupped her hands, starting to sing.*

Season: *He pointed his hand to the Darkwing on his left.* "Frostic stars, rain forth-"

Joy: *She opened her eyes, moving her hands in a circular motion.* "Fiends!" *Ice swirled along the ground around the Darkwing on the right.*

Darkwing R: *It ignored the ice and readied to pounce on Season.* "Skree-"

Joy: "Leave this place!" *She shouted with an echoing voice, causing the ice snake to twirl up like a serpent.*

Darkwing R: "Skree-?" *The ice suddenly crashed on top of it, causing a pulse of mist to swirl around it.*

Joy: "It's trapped-" *She whispered to herself, watching the Darkwing's arm move outside the ice.*

Chrisma: "Fiery might, give me some light-" *A red glyph flashed under her feet and she cupped her hands, aiming them at the Darkwing in the middle.*

Darkwing M: "Skree!" *It jabbed its extending claws forward, pointing them at Chrisma.*

Chrisma: "FLAME BOLT" *She pushed forward, causing a stroke of flames to swirl around her hands.*

Season: "FRIGID STORM"

Darkwing M: "Ski!-" *A fireball instantly shot through the air and slammed into its skull, causing it to explode into pieces.*

Chrisma: "Get in!" *She whispered in excitement and victory, watching the fire extinguish with a puff of dust.*

Darkwing L: "Skerh!" *It jumped in the air and prepared to attack Season with an aerial strike.*

Season: *He looked up, staring at the Darkwing with an emotionless face.* "...-"

Darkwing L: "Sk!?" *Pebble-like ice swirled on the ground and shards of ice shot up, violently piercing into its body several times.*

Tyler: (Each Rostical was a direct hit!)

Season: *He watched the Darkwing in the air suddenly puff into dust, causing shards of ice to fall back to the ground.* (Excellent-)

Darkwing R: "Sk-Skree-?" *It used its free arm to hit the ice around it, catching Joy's attention.*

Joy: "It survived?"

Darkwing R: *The swirl of snake-like ice surrounding it, suddenly exploded and shattered its bones.* "Skwah-"

Joy: "Got it!" *She sounded relieved, lowering her arms.*

Season: "Great work, ladies!" *He looked to his sides at Joy and Chrisma.*

----------

*Holland and Lance ran down a set of stairs, chasing after four Darkwings which sprinted after two men.*

Holland: *He looked past the Darkwings and noticed the men struggling to keep their speed.* "They're going to get the men before we catch up!-"

Lance: "True-" *He flashstepped in front of the Darkwings, causing them to screech in fright.*

Holland: "Haha, nice, Lance."

Lance: *He clicked his fingers, causing blue lightning to spark and stream in between his fingers, forming itself into a sword.* "Air Slash-"

*Lance sliced the air in front of him, causing a visible air slash to knock the Darkwings back and off their feet.*

Lance: (Wow-) *He looked at the lightning in amazement, surprised by his own power.*

Holland: *He sprinted towards the Darkwings, watching them tumble across the ground with a smirk.* (Hear my call!-) "Go!-"

Twotters: *She pounced out from a grey spiralling glyph in the air and landed next to Holland.* (What to do?)

Holland: (Defeat them!) *He ran with concentration.*

Twotters: *She pranced by Holland's side and purred with extending whiskers.* (Harmonic Pulsar.) *A swirl of visible sound which echoed like violins grew in front of her.*

Holland: "Let's do this!" *A materialising yellow glyph formed itself in the air above Holland.*

Twotters: "Reowh!" *She twitched her head and the swirl of sound blasted against the tumbling Darkwings, exploding them into dust.*

Lance: "Kool-" *He watched the dust swirl in the echoing violin chords.*

Holland: "That was like a miniature explosion, Twotters!"

Twotters: "Meow."

Lance: "Aha! Two down already!-"

Man A: *He nudged the man next to him, staring at Lance's back in shock.* "B-Bro, d-did he just flashstep?!"

Man B: "I don't recognise which guild he's from."

Lance: *He looked behind him to the men, who stood motionless with dumbfounded faces.* "You two take cover, we got this!"

Man A: "Let's go!-" *He started to run towards the water-fountain in the distance, waving his hand at Lance.* "Thanks!"

Lance: *He smiled and rubbed under his nose, watching the men run to safety.* (That felt pretty good-)

Holland: "Lance!" *He looked over his shoulder and noticed eight other Darkwings, crawling at a fast pace down the stairs.*

Lance: "Comin'!" *He flicked his arm and the sword of lightning spiralled faster in between his fingers.*

Holland: *He sprinted towards the Darkwings, watching them run in a crawl-like manner.* (Mindless creatures set on burning the environment, they don't deserve to walk on these lands!)

Destiny: *She flew out of the yellow glyph and flapped her wings, gliding alongside Holland.* "Meeheehee."

Twotters: (Do you call that a hiding spot?) *She discreetly glanced at a nearby building, wagging her tail in a predacious manner.*

Darkwing: "Skree!" *It jumped out of the building, diving towards Twotters.*

Twotters: (Harmonic Pulsar.) *She pounced forward, blasting a sphere of visible sound towards the Darkwing.*

Darkwing: "Skr-?!" *It screeched in shock and awkwardly stopped to avoid the sphere, suddenly exploding into a pulse of echoing violins.*

Twotters: *She watched the dust swirl to the ground, causing her to purr in satisfaction.* (You can't fool these eyes of mine.)

Holland: (The Consultant... If I find he's behind these things..) *He unintentionally frowned in determination.*

Lance: *He flashstepped next to Holland with the lightning sword pointing in front of him.* "Let's get 'em, aye!"

Holland: "Yeah!"

Lance: "Five stupid bone thingys ran in a straight line formation towards me and Hollando."

Destiny: "Meeheehehe."

Lance: "And the pony!"

Holland: "Let's slaughter them!"

Lance: "LIGHTNING BLAST" *He punched his left hand forward and a thick stream of yellow lightning blasted into the distance, striking one of the Darkwings.*

Darkwing: *It jumped over the Darkwing which shattered with electricity and continued its frontal charge.* "Skrii!"

Holland: (Twotters, take the one on the end! Destiny, give us some tailwind!)

Twotters: (Alright!) *She ran like a cheetah past Holland and pounced on a Darkwing, causing them to tumble in a circular motion.*

Lance: *He looked ahead, nodding his head at Twotters in an impressed manner.* (Fast little cat-)

Twotters: "Grarryle." *She stood on top of the Darkwing and hissed, biting into its neck bone.*

Darkwing: "Sk-" *It screeched in desperation and readied to stab Twotters off its body.*

Twotters: *She violently rocked her head and snapped its bone, causing its entire body to puff into dust.* (Gross-)

Destiny: *She flew up and hovered in the air behind Lance and Holland.* (Screaming Gale.) *She flapped downwards and silver wind blew against the Darkwings, causing them to run slower.*

Lance: *His hair flapped in front.* "Roar with the skies might-" *He quickly looked at the two cluttered Darkwings, punching towards them.* "THUNDER BOOM"

Holland: *He separated from Lance as a loud rumble of thunder exploded two Darkwings into clouds of dust.* (Awesome-)

Lance: *He looked to the side, noticing three Darkwings running in a crawl-like manner towards him.* "Oh, yea? LIGHTNING CHAIN BLAST"

*Lance straightened his left arm and watched three streams of fluoro yellow lightning swirl in a ball in front of his hand.*

Lance: "Hah!" *He pushed forward, blasting three streams of warped lightning towards the Darkwings.*

Darkwing: "Skree-" *It quickly and unnaturally rolled to the side, avoiding the warped stream of lightning.*

Lance: *He watched the lightning curve behind the Darkwing and fluidly spiral above the ground behind it.* (My latest Rostickal feels like it takes the same amount of Newgongs when I first started to use Lightnin' Blast-)

Darkwing: *It ran into striking distance, preparing to jab into Lance's face.* "Skree!-"

Lance: *He watched the lightning suddenly strike through its skull, causing him to smirk.* "I don't even need to control it-"

Darkwing: "Skrarh!?" *It fell face-first onto the ground, before puffing into a stream of dust.*

Lance: *He watched the wind blow the dust away before it reached him.* "Yea, that's what I'm talkin' 'bout."

Holland: *He looked to the side, watching the two other streams of lightning follow the evading Darkwings.* "How-?"

Lance: *He watched the lightning strike into the two other Darkwings, causing him to smirk.* "Kool-"

Holland: "How did you make your lightning home on to your targets?"

Lance: "Awesomeness?" *He turned around, noticing two Darkwings sprint towards him.* (Another two? It feels like they keep re-spawning-)

Darkwing: *It sprinted into striking distance and lunged itself towards Lance, extending its claws towards his neck.* "Skri!"

Lance: "Too easy-"

Darkwing: *It suddenly flapped its extending skeletal wings, gliding along the ground around Lance.* "Skri-"

Lance: (Shit!-) *He looked shocked and spun around, keeping his focus on the Darkwing.*

Darkwing: *Its skill cracked, slowly forming into a bow.* "Skrii-i-i."

Lance: (How-?) *He straightened his arm, readying to attack the Darkwing.*

Darkwing: *It crawled along the ground, noticing Lance's attention drift to the Darkwing with a bow-shaped skull.* "Skree-"

Lance: "Now! LIGHTNING-"

Darkwing: *It crawled into striking distance and lunged towards Lance, jabbing its claws into his shoulders.* "Skri!-"

Lance: "Argh!"

Darkwing: *It continued to glide around Lance, closely following his lightning sword with its tiny eyes.* "Skrah!-" *It shot out an arrow-like bone which pierced through Lance's lightning sword.*

Lance: "H-Huh-?" *He watched the lightning dissipate.*

Darkwing: *It dug its claws deeper into Lance, causing him to yell.* "Skauh!"

Holland: *He punched into a Darkwing's skull, watching its head shatter around his fist.* "Lance?!" *He looked over his shoulder in concern, blowing dust off his knuckles.*

Lance: "I'm fine, aye!" *He spoke with a grunt.*

Holland: "Good." *He smirked, focusing his attention to another two Darkwings in front of him.*

Lance: (As if this will stop me!-)

Darkwing: *It purposely rocked itself, causing Lance to tumble back due to its weight.* "Sk-k-k." *Its bones cracked as its head started to take shape of a bow.*

Lance: *He looked up and noticed the Darkwing that shot his lightning sword, gliding towards him.* "THUNDER BOOM"

*Lance punched towards the gliding Darkwing, watching it explode with a rumble of thunder.*

Darkwing: *It extended its legs and touched the ground, trying to resist Lance's struggle.* "Skri."

Lance: "Get off me! Smear upon the skies and envelop your might, thunder roar down-"

Darkwing: "Skree!" *It kept a strong hold behind Lance, aiming its newly formed head at Lance.*

Lance: "LIGHTNING PULSE"

Darkwing: "Sk-" *It poked out a spear-like bone, readying to fire it off into the back of Lance's head.*

Lance: "Harh!" *He clapped his hands above him and a ring of blue lightning rumbled like thunder.*

Darkwing: *An electric pulse blew off its arms and legs, causing it to explode off Lance.* "Skra!-" *Its body puffed into dust.*

*The lightning ring pulsed from Lance and hit several nearby Darkwings, causing them to explode into dust.*

Lance: *He took deep breaths and noticed the Darkwing's arms, sticking out of his shoulders.* (Its arms ripped right off its body! That owned them!-)

*Lance stood up straight and ripped out the Darkwing's arms, watching them puff into dust.*

Holland: *He kneed a Darkwing on the back, cracking its spine.* "Twotters!"

Twotters: *She quickly leapt on top of a Darkwing behind Holland, causing it to tumble across the ground.* "Rarreow!"

Holland: *He spun around in a boxer-like manner, punching a Darkwing in the ribs.* "Weak-"

Twotters: *She pounced off the Darkwing in mid-tumble and landed on all fours.* "Meow!"

Darkwing: *It was unable to stop its tumble and slammed into the side of a brick wall.* "Skreh-"

Twotters: *She raised her head and closed her eyes.* (Purfling Frequency.) *A high violin-like pitch screeched through the air, disorientating all the Darkwings on the lower level.*

Darkwing: *It leant off the wall and shook its head, watching the shadow cover its body.* "Screeh!"

Twotters: *She lowered her head as the high pitch sound continued to play.* (What are these creatures?) *She waved her tail in suspense, waiting for the Darkwing to charge.*

Holland: *He ran up and punched a Darkwing in the skull.* "Ha-" *He jumped forward and uppercut it under the chin.*

Darkwing: *It looked down at Holland, ignoring its cracking chin.* "Skree-"

Holland: *He kicked the Darkwing higher into the air, motioning his hand towards it.* "Now!"

Destiny: *She dived towards Holland at amazing speeds and clipped the Darkwing with her wing, causing its skeletal wing to shatter away.* "Meeheehee."

Holland: *He smirked, watching the bones puff into dust.* "Good work-"

*Holland cupped both hands and punched downwards, smashing its skull to pieces.*

Holland: *He looked at Twotters, wiping sweat off the top of his lips.* (We don't know what these creatures are, but we believe they're the work of the Consultant.)

Twotters: *She purred in acknowledgement.* (The Consultant..)

Darkwing: *It stepped away from the wall and continued to shake its head in disorientation.* "Skri!"

Twotters: *She squinted her eyes at the Darkwing, purring in a taunt-like manner.* (Finding it hard to concentrate?)

Darkwing: "Skree?!" *It focused its attention on Twotters and instantly sprinted towards her.*

Twotters: (Frenzy Symphony.) *She opened her jaw and an orchestra of violins played.* "Hsss-"

Lance: "Hah!" *He clicked his fingers, causing electricity to string in between his fingers.* "Streaming Sword."

*Lance jabbed the lightning sword forward, watching its stream extend into four Darkwings.*

Lance: *He watched the Darkwings puff into a dust cloud, causing the lightning to spark around them.* "Piss easy.."

Twotters: *The air rippled around her mouth.* (This works the same as Harmonic Pulsar, but it's slower and stronger-)

Darkwing: *It ignored the rippling air around Twotters' mouth and ran into striking distance, raising its arm.* "Skreah!"

Twotters: "Bwaha-eow-" *She lowered her head and coughed out a vortex of sound, disintegrating the Darkwing in front of her.*

Lance: *He frowned as he stared at four Darkwings, crawling along the houses.* (They're moving as fast as they were on the ground-)

*The Darkwings suddenly jumped off the houses and flapped their wings directly towards Lance.*

Lance: "H-Huh?" *He mumbled to himself in shock as if he wasn't expecting it.* (Not that I'm complainin'-)

*Lance grunted in thought and charged towards the Darkwings, watching them glide several feet above the ground.*

Lance: (-But why fly straight towards me-)

Darkwing: *It squinted its eyes at Lance and flapped its wings harder, extending its claws.* "Skreee."

Lance: "MAGNETIC RUMBLE" *He dived forward and raised his arm, causing a white glyph to expand from it.*

Destiny: *She looked down from a bird's eye view, noticing Lance drop to the ground.* (He's defenceless, I'll cover-)

Lance: *He moved his arm and slid on the expanding shield, causing rumble-like sparks to scatter on the sides.* (Ha, kool-)

Destiny: (He's using the glyph as a mode of transport?)

Lance: *He lay on his back with his arm awkwardly facing his side to keep the glyphic shield active.* "Smear upon the skies, blue waves crashing down-"

*The Darkwings looked down at Lance, who slid just under them in confusion.*

Lance: *He straightened his arm, watching a ball of light grow in front of his palm.* "LIGHTNING BLAST"

*Lance smiled child-like and pushed forward, causing a massive lightning stream to slice the Darkwings above him.*

Destiny: *She watched the Darkwings continue to glide above the ground unaffected by the lightning.* (He missed them at that range?!)

Lance: "Bah-" *He rocked forward, causing the shield to tilt at an angle.* "..." *He slid onto his feet and lowered his arm, causing the shield to disintegrate away.*

*The Darkwings suddenly shattered in halves and crashed on to the ground.*

Holland: "Whoa! Nice work, Lance." *He raised his fists and charged towards another two Darkwings.*

Lance: *He smiled and looked at Holland, taking a moment's rest.* "Yea-"

Holland: "Harh!" *He jumped forward and jabbed a Darkwing on the side, causing its ribs to shatter.*

Darkwing: *It silently extended its dagger-like claws and crawled closer to the back of Holland's feet.* "Kee-ke-ki-"

Twotters: *She watched from a distance.* (Behind you!)

Holland: "Harh!" *He turned around and punched the Darkwing downwards, causing it to slide along the ground.*

Destiny: (Feather Buster.) *She flew in the air and flapped her wings, causing a line of dagger-like feathers to jab into the ground towards the Darkwing.*

Darkwing: *It quickly flipped on to its legs and screeched at Holland before several feathers shot into its back.* "Skee-aarh-" *Its shadow extinguished and its bones faded to dust, causing Destiny to sneeze in triumphantly.*

Lance: "Since when did you get so epically strong too?"

Holland: "I have the added strength of my summons!"

Lance: *He nodded his head with a smile, staring at Holland's back.* "Nice-"

Holland: "There's two more left!" *He kept his eyesight on another Darkwing, staring at it with magnified vision.*

Lance: *He watched Holland prepare himself to attack.* "Right-" *He clicked his fingers, causing lightning to stream in between his fingers.*

Holland: "I've got this one over here-"

Darkwing: *It suddenly shot an arrow-like bone at Holland, causing another bone to extend out of its bow-shaped skull.* "Skree-"

Holland: *He quickly jumped to the side in an animal-like manner, closely avoiding the shard of bone.* (How annoying-)

Twotters: (Sorrow Chorus.) *She opened her jaw and low sounding violins echoed, dulling the Darkwing's vision.*

Darkwing: "Skree!" *It shot another skeletal arrow in Holland's general direction, completely missing him.*

Holland: *He grunted and tensed his muscles, sprinting into striking distance.* "Grrerah!" *He threw his arm and punched downwards, shattering the Darkwing to pieces.*

Lance: (That looks easy enough-) *He lowered his arm, causing the lightning sword to spark and scatter away.* (And it would save energy-)

Darkwing: *It sprinted from the shadows of a market and it screeched at Lance, catching his attention.* "Skree!"

Lance: *He formed a fist and stepped to the side, focusing in front of him.* (Come on!)

Darkwing: "Skeeh." *It extended its claws and ran on its hind legs, giving the illusion it was taller than it was.*

Lance: *The Darkwing ran in striking distance and jabbed its arm forward, screeching in Lance's face.* "Whoa-" *He quickly flashsided out of the way.* "Ha, too slow aye!"

Darkwing: *Its body lunged forward due to jabbing nothing.* "Skree?" *It looked to the side, glaring at Lance in confusion.*

Lance: "Take this!-"

Holland: *He held his shoulder and moved his arm, staring at Lance.* (My shoulder hurts a little.)

Lance: "Ha!" *He punched the Darkwing, causing a faint cracking sound.*

Holland: "Wow!" *He listened with heightened hearing, causing him to chuckle in amazement.* "You cracked its bones!-"

Lance: *He squealed at the top of his lungs, staring at his knuckles in pain.* "Argh-"

Holland: "Oh..-"

Lance: *He gritted his teeth in pain, frowning at the Darkwing in anger.* (Shit that hurts!) *He glanced at his knuckles, triggering a flashback.*

-

Alicia: "You're good at what you do, and they're good at what they do.. You shouldn't compare yourself to the researchers."

-

Lance: *He shook his head in shock, taking a step back from the Darkwing.* "Tssk-"

Darkwing: "Skree!" *It spun on its toes and slashed Lance across the face with its claws.*

Lance: *He ignored the scratch-like cuts on his face and rammed his hand towards the Darkwing, watching a stream of lightning form into a sword.* "Gah!-"

Holland: *He watched Lance jab the lightning sword into the Darkwing's chest, watching it violently screech in reaction.* (Well, that got it.)

Darkwing: "Skri-harh-" *It twitched with streams of lightning before bursting into dust.*

Lance: "Shit-" *He mumbled and lowered his arm, looking at his knuckles in pain.*

Holland: *He ran up to Lance and looked around.* "Are you okay? We've cleared off this level."

Lance: *He looked around in shock, pretending not to be hurt.* "Yea, I'm good. I thought there were more-"

*Darkwing screeches could be heard on the higher levels of the city, alerting Lance and Holland.*

Lance: "It's not over yet!" *He sniffed and started to run towards the set of stairs, causing Holland to follow.*

Holland: (Thanks, you two-) *Destiny and Twotters exhaled with recognition before disintegrating into nothing.*

----------

PKMY: *She smirked and spun around on the bridge, watching a Darkwing charge towards her.* "Heh." *She rammed her fist into the Darkwing's skull, flicking it away.*

Alicia: *She skipped up the stairs, avoiding piles of bones which scattered the ground.* (PKMY's a powerful fighter-)

PKMY: *She glanced at groups of Darkwings, watching them screech in different areas around her.* (There's twenty or so-)

Alicia: "PKMY-" *She ran in front of the bridge and looked at PKMY, panting in exhaustion.*

PKMY: "Several are airborne, be careful."

Alicia: *She looked up, watching several Darkwings fly in a circular motion.* "A-Alright-"

PKMY: "Show me what you got!-" *She bent her knees and waved her arms behind her back with a smirk, readying herself to run.*

Darkwing: "Skree."

PKMY: "Skree yourself, you heap of shit!-" *She bolted across the bridge at an amazing speed.*

Alicia: (Wow-)

Darkwing: *It watched PKMY run into striking distance, causing it to slash across her neck.* "Skr-"

PKMY: "Heh-" *She double flipped forward and threw her leg down, smashing the skull of the Darkwing.*

Darkwing: "Skra!" *It collapsed under PKMY's foot, puffing into dust.*

Alicia: (She shows no fear-)

Darkwing: *It flapped its wings, suddenly diving towards PKMY.* "Skree-"

Alicia: "Behind!-"

PKMY: *The air rippled around her hand.* "Ha-" *She bent forward and back-kicked a Darkwing which crept up behind her.*

Darkwing: "Skerah-" *It suddenly puffed into dust around PKMY's leg.*

Alicia: "I-" *She spoke under her breath, shaking her head in amazement at PKMY.*

PKMY: "Seven finger snap-flying palm strike." *She punched the air above her and the Darkwing shattered into dust.*

Alicia: (She didn't even look up, and she knew that Darkwing was going to strike-)

PKMY: *Strings of dust rained down around her.* "Are you going to leave me all the fun?" *She stood in a powerful stance, looking at Alicia.*

Alicia: "O-Oh, sorry-" *She hesitantly nodded her head, running onto the bridge with her arms swaying to each side.*

PKMY: *She glanced at the Darkwings in the air and bent her knees, smirking in preparation.* "Heh-"

Alicia: "W-What are you-?"

PKMY: "Herr-" *She suddenly jumped up off the bridge like a torpedo, causing the wood to creak.*

Alicia: *She looked up at PKMY in shock.* (She jumps so high, it's like she can fly-)

Darkwing: *It hovered in the air and noticed PKMY, flapping its wings in confusion.* "Skree?"

PKMY: "Ya-" *She spiralled in the air and kicked the Darkwing with a powerful force, causing it to shatter to one side into a dust cloud.* "-Hoo!-"

Darkwing: *It looked down, watching the dust spiral around PKMY's foot.* "Skree-?"

PKMY: *She used the kick's force to push herself higher into the air.* (Jumping off of the Rasticsplash or the Astragons remaining in the air was fun to practice back in the days.)

Darkwing: *It screeched in shock, quickly pointing its claws at PKMY.* "Skrii!"

PKMY: *She twirled in the air and formed two fists, readying to punch the Darkwing.* "Yahoo!"

Alicia: (How is she jumping off the air?) *She stared at PKMY's acrobatic skills in awe.* (She really is amazing-)

Darkwing: *It landed on the bridge, causing it to violently shake.* "Sk-k."

Alicia: *She looked down, watching the bridge shake in confusion.* (What-?)

Darkwing: *It stared at Alicia in an intimidating manner as another two Darkwings landed by its side.* "Ski?"

Alicia: *She stepped back, staring at the three Darkwings in shock.* (No-)

PKMY: (Don't hold back, if we don't stop these things-) *She punched the Darkwing with both hands, causing it to explode into dust.*

Darkwing: *It flew towards PKMY from behind and glided into striking distance, extending its legs forward.* "Skree-"

PKMY: *She looked behind her and jumped off the exploding dust, quickly spinning in a ball.* "Harh!"

Darkwing: "Skree?!" *It screeched in shock as if it wasn't expecting PKMY to move in such a manner.*

*PKMY straightened her leg and kicked the Darkwing across, causing its legs and wings to snap off.*

PKMY: (-Then, they'll attack the people who can't use Rostical!-) *Her voice echoed in Alicia's head.*

Darkwing: *It awkwardly leant to one side, suddenly spiralling down to the ground.* "Skereee!"

PKMY: "Heh, not so tough without your wings, eh?" *She looked down, smirking in a cocky manner.*

Tyler: *He watched the Darkwing smash into the ground, causing its bones to scatter past his feet.* "P-Paralysing Vapours!"

*Tyler threw an orange ball at the Darkwing, watching it explode into an orange dust cloud.*

Darkwing: "S-Skree!" *It violently twitched on the ground, trying to move.*

Season: *He looked over his shoulder, watching the Darkwing struggle to stand back up.* (It's paralysed? Good work, Tyler.)

Joy: *She cupped her hands, singing on a high note.* "FRIGID DISTRESS" *She sang with an echoing voice, causing a serpent-like swirl of ice to crash on top of the Darkwing.*

Tyler: (Whoa-) *He watched the Darkwing shatter with the ice, noticing its remains puff into a swirl of dust.*

Joy: *She nodded her head in accomplishment, focusing her attention back in front.* (Ghastly creatures!)

Alicia: *She nodded her head at PKMY and faced the Darkwings, frowning in determination.* (She's right!-)

Darkwing: *The Darkwing in the middle slowly crawled forward, readying to sprint for Alicia.* "Skree?!"

Alicia: "WATER STORM" *She pushed forward and an eruption of clear water shot two of the Darkwings into the air.*

Darkwing: *It looked to its sides, watching the water's pressure crush the Darkwings into dust.* "Skree!"

Alicia: "ICICLE EDGE" *She spun around and swayed her arms downwards, causing a long thin spear to swiftly strike the Darkwing in the skull.*

Darkwing: "Sk-k-k?!" *Its bones cracked around the ice spear and it fell forward, suddenly puffing into chunks of frozen dust.*

Alicia: *She lowered her arms, slowly exhaling in relief.* (I underestimated myself.. That was easy.)

PKMY: "Yahoo-" *Her hair and robes spiralled around her as she slowly drifted to a nearby Darkwing.* (From the fight with mummy on the water, my Astragon control has actually improved.)

Darkwing: *It flapped its wings in mid-air, glaring at Alicia from a distance.* "Sk-k?" *Its skull cracked and took shape of a bow, aiming its head at Alicia.*

PKMY: "Hey."

Darkwing: "Skri-?" *PKMY moved in front of it, causing it to lose its focus on Alicia.*

PKMY: "Three finger snap-flashing fist strike." *She started to hit the Darkwing with the tip of her fingers.*

Darkwing: *It squinted its tiny eyes and moved its skeletal arms, blocking PKMY's strikes.* "Skra, skra!"

PKMY: "Eh?" *She watched her arms move slightly faster, causing the shadow around the Darkwing to sway.* (My strokes are increasing in speed with every jab.)

Darkwing: *Small pulses of its bones shattered all over its body, causing PKMY to smirk.* "Skri-ah-earh!-"

PKMY: "Harh!" *She poked her fingers through the Darkwing and spirals of dust swirled around her fingertips.*

Darkwing: "Skrah!" *It screeched in pain, trying to keep itself afloat in the air.*

PKMY: "Either they're getting weaker-"

Darkwing: "Skreah!" *It screeched in anger, violently jabbing its claws to the side of PKMY's head.*

PKMY: *She jabbed her finger into the Darkwing's shoulder, causing its arm to snap off past her.* "Or my attacks are much stronger than they used to be."

*PKMY blew dust off her fingers, watching the Darkwing suddenly puff into dust.*

PKMY: "Its bones easily shattered with every strike, and-"

*Eight Darkwings jumped off nearby buildings, diving behind PKMY into striking distance.*

PKMY: *She looked over her shoulder and gasped with widening eyes.* (I didn't sense!-)

Alicia: "Unwritten holy laws, strike down my foe-" *She raised her arms, ignoring an expanding white glyph underneath her.*

Darkwing: *It screeched in a victorious manner, jabbing its wing towards PKMY's eye.* "Skree!-"

Alicia: "SHINING RAIN" *She lowered her arms, causing razor blades of light to rain down, quickly stabbing the Darkwings around PKMY.*

PKMY: *She listened to their bones cracking, watching the spears of light violently disintegrate the shadow around the Darkwings.* (That was close-)

Alicia: (Just in time-)

Darkwing: *It ran along the rail of the bridge towards Alicia, extending its claws with killing intent.* "Skree."

Alicia: "AQUA LIQUID" *She swayed her arm and a wave of water splashed the Darkwing off the bridge.*

Season: *He looked up in shock and quickly stumbled back, watching the Darkwing shatter on the ground in front of him.* "Hmm-?"

*Season focused in front and observed two Darkwings, sprinting towards him.*

Season: *He frowned and focused, causing a blue glyph to shine underneath him.* "Frostic stars, rain forth, FRIGID STORM" *A swirl of ice materialised around the Darkwings.*

PKMY: *She landed on a thin bridge with one foot, instantly looking to her side in shock.* "Argh-"

Darkwing: *It dived down, jabbing its sharp claws at PKMY's face.* "Skri!-"

PKMY: *She bent back and her head touched the bridge, causing the Darkwing to slice the air above her.* "Grr!"

Darkwing: *It looked down to PKMY and flapped its wings, readying to jab towards her face.* "Skree!"

PKMY: "Airs pulsing, searing and soaring-" *She quickly rolled to the side, watching the wood crack around the Darkwing's fingers.*

Darkwing: "Skree!" *It jabbed its claws out of the wood and flapped its wings, flying on top of PKMY.*

PKMY: "Rippling strike." *She raised her hands above her head and pushed them directly towards the Darkwing.*

Darkwing: *It hovered over PKMY and raised its arms, readying to stab her in the chest.* "Skee-"

PKMY: *A ragged red beam pulsated and blasted the Darkwing high into the air, knocking it off the bridge.* "Piece of shit!-"

Darkwing: "Sk!-" *It tried to hit the pulsating beam away, watching its arms grind away like it rubbed against sandpaper.*

PKMY: *She slowly exhaled, slapping herself on the cheek.* (I got to be more careful-)

Darkwing: "Skeree.." *It screeched in a defeated manner and closed its eyes in realisation, exploding into a wave of dust.*

Alicia: *She looked over to the other bridge, noticing PKMY lay on her back.* "Are you okay?"

PKMY: "Pssh, yea!" *She raised her legs and rocked forward, flipping onto her feet.* "Focus on your own!"

Alicia: *She nodded her head and looked around.* "Where-?"

Darkwing: "Skreeh!" *It glided at high speeds, tackling Alicia across the bridge.*

Alicia: "Ah!-" *She squinted her eyes and gritted her teeth, as the Darkwing rode her along the bridge.* (It's heavy!-)

Darkwing: "Ske-e-e." *It opened its jaw and leant face to face with Alicia, watching the wood hit the back of her head.*

Alicia: *She quietly squealed, staring at the shards of bones in the Darkwing's mouth which acted as teeth.* "Icy swirls draw to the skies, frosted water lend me your power, GLACIA'S EDGE"

Darkwing: *A blue glyph shined underneath Alicia, causing it to tilt its head in curiosity.* "Skee-?" *Two pillars of ice shot up from both sides, shattering its head.*

Alicia: "G-Glargh-" *Dust streamed into her face as the Darkwing disintegrated over her.*

PKMY: *She turned around and faced Alicia, taking several steps back.* "Hmm-" *She ran across the bridge and hopped on the rail, bending her knees.*

Alicia: *She slid across the bridge and stopped, coughing in shock.* (That was close-)

PKMY: *She jumped off the bridge and into the air, spreading her arms.* "Heh-" *She spiralled in the air and rolled onto the bridge in front of Alicia.* "You still ready to fight, princess?"

Alicia: *She placed her hands on the bridge and stood up, brushing the dust off her garments.* "Yes!-"

*Ten Darkwings dived towards Alicia and PKMY from every direction at incredible speeds.*

Alicia: *She looked up, gasping in defeat.* "They're coming at us too fast and at different angles, my Rostical won't be quick enough-"

PKMY: *Her body glowed a shade of blue and she punched her fists together, causing her hair blow back.* "Shut up."

Alicia: "W-What-?" *She whispered under her breath, glancing at PKMY in confusion.*

PKMY: "Crippling might, twenty two finger wind gales strike." *Her fists vibrated and she stepped forward with a disappearing image, causing the wood on the bridge to crack.*

Alicia: (PKMY, where did she-?) *She thought in shock and quickly focused on several Darkwings, watching them fly into striking distance.* "No!-"

*Alicia squealed and slightly frowned in determination, raising her hands in a defensive manner.*

PKMY: *She glanced around her, watching things move in slow motion.* (Hmph-)

Alicia: *She crossed her arms and squinted her eyes, staring at a Darkwing directly in front of her.* "ICICLE-"

PKMY: *She ran towards the Darkwing which was about to stab Alicia with its claws.* "Humph-" *She grunted in a deep voice, readying to attack.* (Take this!-)

Alicia: "-EDGE-" *She stared at the Darkwing and leant back with widening eyes.*

Darkwing: *It extended its claws and screeched in victory, suddenly noticing its arm missing.* "Skree?"

Alicia: "H-Huh?" *She sounded surprised as if she was expecting the Darkwing to stab her.*

PKMY: *She threw the Darkwing's arm away and quickly punched the side of its skull.* (You're next-) *She spun around and kicked the next Darkwing, causing her to chuckle in joy.*

Alicia: *She looked up, watching an ice spear form itself in the air.* (No! It's going to get me!-)

Darkwing: *It raised its other arm, readying to stab Alicia.* "Skree-" *It suddenly smashed and exploded, causing Alicia to squeal in fright.*

Alicia: "H-How!?"

*Five other Darkwings shattered in a circular motion around Alicia, catching her attention.*

PKMY: (Grr-) *She raised her leg next to her cheek and kicked down on another Darkwing, listening to a deep crack.* (Harh!-)

*PKMY spread her arms and formed fists, jumping across the bridge past Alicia.*

PKMY: (Being in a constant flashstepping state causes a lot of stress on the lungs and muscles-)

*PKMY thought to herself with a frown and stared at the three remaining Darkwings, running towards them in excitement.*

PKMY: *She ran into striking distance and noticed the Darkwings' frozen mid-attacking-like stances.* (This is anecdotal, but I find holding my breath helps me ease into these combos!-) *She spun around and side-smashed the Darkwings with her fists.*

Alicia: *She jumped in fright, watching each Darkwing shatter around her.* (Is that PKMY? What is causing them to do this-?!)

PKMY: *She flashstepped next to Alicia and took a deep breath, hiding her slight exhaustion.* (That puffed me out a bit.)

Alicia: *She looked up, glancing to each side.* "Looks like there's no more up here."

PKMY: "Then let's help them down there!" *She grabbed the bridge's rail with one hand and threw herself over, causing Alicia to gasp in fright.*

Alicia: "PKMY." *She quickly leant over the rail and looked down, intensely staring at PKMY.*

PKMY: *She landed next to Season and Tyler, forming fists with a smirk.* "Alright, who's next?"

Alicia: *She started to run across the bridge and a screech from the sky caught her attention.* "O-One more?!"

Darkwing: *It flapped its wings to keep itself hovering high in the air and screeched, shooting shards of bone at the buildings.* "Skree!"

Alicia: *She quickly turned around and looked up, causing her hair to whip over her shoulder.* (It's destroying the houses!)

Darkwing: *It flew across a window, purposely scratching it with its wing.* "Skree-"

Alicia: (I can handle this!) *She cupped her hands and a white glyph shined under her feet.*

Darkwing: *The light instantly drew its attention towards Alicia.* "Skri!"

Alicia: "'O holy powers draw towards me, HOLY LANCE"

Darkwing: *It straightened its body and formed itself into a spear, causing the shadow to spiral around it.* "Ski-?"

*White strings materialised in the air and wrapped themselves around the Darkwing, causing it to slowly descend.*

Darkwing: "Skree!" *It screeched in desperation, trying to break free.*

Alicia: "Please, begone!"

*A white sparkle twinkled in the sky and a white spear of light shot down.*

Darkwing: "Ske-" *The spear shot straight through its head and blasted down, violently disintegrating its shadow.*

Alicia: "Wha-?" *The spear of light smashed through the bridge and struck into the ground next to Tyler, causing wood to splinter into the air.* "Eek-" *She awkwardly stepped to the side, due to the swaying bridge.*

Tyler: "A-Ah!" *He started at the disintegrating spear in shock, causing his face to light up.*

Alicia: "I-I'm so sorry!" *She shouted in a guilty manner, watching a spear-like wave of dust hit the bridge.*

Chrisma: *She watched the spear disintegrate into particles of fading light.* (Radiatons!)

*Alicia bit her bottom lip and started to run across the bridge, making her way down to the lower level.*

Alicia: (I wasn't expecting the Rostical to pierce the creature so easily, then into the bridge!-)

Season: *He frowned in concentration and raised his arm, watching a Darkwing sprint towards him at full speed.* "PIERCING CLOUDS"

*Season spun around and dropped his arm in front, causing a pulse of smog to swirl around his hand.*

Tyler: *He noticed a wave of wind blow against his face, drawing his attention to Season.* (I've never seen Season use all these kinds of Rostical before-)

Season: "Hah!" *He pushed forward, blasting a cloud-like stream of curved smog towards the Darkwing.*

Darkwing: "Skrah!-" *The smog hit its head, causing it to suddenly explode into a sphere of cloud-like dust.*

Tyler: (It couldn't even dodge his smoke-)

Season: *The smog cleared in front and he noticed another two Darkwings sprinting towards him.* "More-"

*A thick stream of lightning suddenly shot through the two Darkwings, causing bones to violently snap into the air.*

Season: "Hmm?!" *He watched pieces of bones tumble across the ground as they faded into dust.*

Lance: "LIGHTNING BLAST-" *He ran towards Season with his arm straightened as the lightning streamed from his hand.*

Joy: (Wow-) *She stood with Chrisma, staring at Lance surprised.*

Holland: "The lower level is cleared!" *He shouted in a deep voice, running with Lance up to Season.*

Season: "Great-"

PKMY: "The top level is cleared-" *Her voice sounded distorted as she punched a Darkwing against a nearby market booth.*

Season: (Fantastic!-) "Although it may not seem like it, their numbers must be dropping-"

*An orchestra of screeches echoed from the dirt cloud near the entrance of the city.*

Season: *His eyes widened with surprise.* "I-I stand corrected."

Lance: *He turned around, staring at the entrance in shock.* "What?!"

Joy: "Oh my! That sounded like-"

Chrisma: "There're hundreds more!" *She interrupted Joy with an enthusiastic groan, awkwardly tugging on her robes.*

Alicia: *She ran down the path towards the party, running in a feminine manner.* "The top level is cleared!-"

PKMY: "I know, I already told them, keep up!"

Alicia: "S-Sorry-" *She ran up to Lance and instantly noticed his blood, causing her to instinctively place her hands on his wounds.*

Lance: "Hey-" *He sounded happy to see her, keeping a serious frown on his face.*

Alicia: "HEALING RINGS" *Small rings of light spiralled in between her hands and Lance.*

Lance: *He looked down, watching the light visibly heal his wounds.* (The stingin' is going away-)

Alicia: *She noticed scratch-like marks on his face, causing the rings of light to spiral around them.* (There-)

Lance: "That's heaps better, aye-" *He smiled and leant forward to kiss Alicia on the forehead.* "Thanks-"

PKMY: "There's a time and place for everything, guess wat? Now isn't the time!"

Lance: *He rolled his eyes and leant back, nodding his head in understanding.* "I know-"

Alicia: *She gasped with uncertainty, watching blue lightning spiral in between her hands.* "L-Lance?"

Lance: "H-Huh?"

PKMY: *She frowned at Alicia and Lance, causing her to grunt in frustration.* "I saw the memories from quick fingers!"

Tyler: (Quick-?) *He glanced at PKMY, nervously adjusting the strap to his bag.* "P-Please don't use that nickname-"

PKMY: *She ignored Tyler, keeping her focus on Lance.* "Don't use your Hi-Ougi here!"

Alicia: "Hi-Ougi?"

PKMY: "Ethereal Rapids!-"

Lance: "But we're not-?" *He spoke under his breath, watching his lightning intensify around their hands.*

Alicia: "M-My Astragons are-?"

Lance: "Hi-Owgee."
Alicia: "Hi-Ougi."

PKMY: (Idiots!)

Chrisma: "Get in!" *She groaned with fascination, watching mist spiral around the lightning.*

Alicia: "What's happening?"

Lance: "I-I dunno, aye?"

Alicia: (Why is this happening? We didn't channel the Neurons to activate our Hi-Ougi!)

Season: *He watched the lightning envelop Alicia and Lance's hands, tightly joining them together.* (That new Neuron signature I picked up from Lance seems to be reacting to Alicia?)

Alicia: "I-I can't move my-?"

Lance: *He looked up, nodding his head.* "The words!"

Alicia: "I-I hear them, too-"

Lance and Alicia: "Streaming sword, Icicle Stroke-" *The sounds of ice hardening echoed from their hands.*

Tyler: "..." *He nervously held his RPG bag, unintentionally stepping towards Season for comfort.*

Lance and Alicia: "Ice-chain Claymores." *They stepped away from each other, causing sword-like ice to form in their hands.*

Lance: *He watched lightning visibly dance inside the ice, causing him to grunt in amazement.* "Holy shit, aha!"

Chrisma: *She noticed the lightning, causing the ice to sparkle.* "Shit your face, look how pretty it is."

Alicia: *She awkwardly held the swords in her hands as if she didn't know what to do with them.* "They're long.."

PKMY: (Where does the try-hard keep shitting these techniques out of?! It's true his growth is quicker than the average person, but people train for years to obtain this level-) *She stared at the claymore-like ice swords, watching the lightning move inside them in a jealous manner.*

Joy: "Oh my! Behind you!" *She pointed behind Alicia and cupped her hands, causing a blue glyph to shine underneath her.*

Darkwing: "Skree!" *It screeched from behind Alicia, instantly catching her attention.*

Alicia: "Eek-" *She turned around, facing the Darkwing in shock.*

Darkwing: "Skri!" *It sprinted towards into striking distance and screeched at Alicia, raising its claws.*

Tyler: (It's attracted to the moving electricity in the ice.)

Lance: *He raised the ice sword, readying to jump in front of Alicia.* "I got-"

Alicia: *She awkwardly stepped forward, slashing the ice sword across.* "I can't-"

Darkwing: *Its legs suddenly froze, causing it to awkwardly slide past Alicia.* "Sk-k?"

Chrisma: "But, she didn't even strike its legs?"

Lance: "Air Slash." *He slashed downwards, causing a visible air slash to violently burst the Darkwing in half.*

Season: *He watched the Darkwing puff into dust, causing him to glance at PKMY in disappointment.* "That came from the top level?"

PKMY: "Wateva." *She grunted, walking towards Alicia.*

Lance: *He raised the ice sword to his face, admiring the lightning inside.* (Nice.)

PKMY: "If you don't mind?" *She presented her hand, implying for Alicia to give her the ice swords.*

Alicia: "P-Please, I don't like these."

Joy: "Are you fine with her taking the swords? It was your Hi-Ougi?" *She spoke in respect, glancing at Alicia and Lance.*

Alicia: "I don't like swords."

Lance: "Yea, and only an idiot would put the healer on the frontline."

PKMY: *She held the ice swords and looked at Lance, waiting for his response.* "So-?"

Lance: "Don't say anythin'." *He looked away, implying he didn't care.*

PKMY: "Heh." *She smirked, slashing the air with the ice sword.* (They're just as light as my Ryukku-)

Alicia: *She heard a cough, causing her to look at each party member in concern.* "Is anyone else hurt?"

Joy: *She nodded her head, slightly lifting up her robes.* "My ankle was slashed by the creature's claws."

Alicia: "O-Okay-" *She ran past the party and up to Joy.* "HEALING RINGS"

Holland: *He stared at the dirt cloud with a worried expression.* "It sounds like there are heaps out there. How are we going to handle this?"

PKMY: *She flashstepped next to Holland and inhaled deeply, crossing the ice swords in front of her.* "We'll just have to kill them all."

Lance: *He touched his healed wounds, causing him to discreetly smirk at Alicia.* "Rightio-"

Holland: "Kill them all.." *He mumbled to himself in a deep voice as if that was the only option.*

Lance: *He flashstepped next to PKMY and raised his hand, watching the lightning stream inside the ice sword.* "'Sup, shit nuggets?"

PKMY: *She squinted her eyes, glancing at Lance's sword.* "Your lightning is distracting-"

Lance: "The ranga's eyes flickered due to the lightning in the sparklin' epic ice claymores."

PKMY: "What did you call me-?"

Darkwing: "Skree!" *It dived out of the dirt cloud, catching the party's attention.*

Lance: "Stand back-"

PKMY: "Pfft-" *She frowned at Lance and stepped forward, suddenly throwing the ice swords towards the dirt cloud.*

Lance: "Wha-?! My swords?!" *He watched the swords fly across the city at amazing speeds suddenly hitting the unsuspecting Darkwing in the skull.*

Holland: "Good aiming-"

Lance: "But my swords?!"

PKMY: "They were distracting-"

Lance: "You could've given 'em to Holland?!"

Holland: "Swords aren't my thing-"

Lance: "But-"

Darkwing: "Skre-?!" *It screeched and grabbed the ice swords, violently cracking them with its claws.*

PKMY: "Eh? A last-minute survival attack?"

Lance: "But, my swords-?!"

*The swords suddenly shattered in the Darkwing's hands, freeing the fluoro yellow lightning inside, causing it to spread like veins.*

PKMY: (Huh?!)

Darkwing: "Sk-k-k-" *It violently twitched in the lightning, suddenly exploding in the fluid lightning.*

Lance: *He watched the lightning spark around its dust, causing him to smirk in a proud manner.* "Kool-"

Holland: *He noticed the lightning move on its own accord and swirl into the dirt cloud, exploding unseen Darkwings.* "Cool."

PKMY: "Tssk." *She slightly looked away, rolling her eyes.* (Stop insulting me because of my hair colour, shit head!)

Lance: *He gasped in fright, awkwardly waving the ice swords in PKMY's face.* "Holy shit!"

Holland: "What?"

Lance: "H-How?"

PKMY: (Shut up, you're embarrassing yourself.)

Holland: "Lance? Dude?"

Lance: "We gotta discuss talkin' in people's heads later, but for now-" *He took a deep breath, lowering his swords.* "-We'll just have to smash 'em all."

Holland: *He coughed, standing in a battle-ready position.* "How should we fight them?"

PKMY: *She looked at Holland, discreetly grunting to herself in thought.* (His tone was mixed with anger and uncertainty.)

Lance: "Well, the three of us should see who smashes the most?"

PKMY: "Eh?" *She licked her lips and smirked in a competitive manner, placing her hands on her sides.* "You up for it, Holly?"

Holland: *He smiled and tightened his fists, nodding his head with a smirk.* "Sounds like a challenge."

Lance: "A challenge? Nah, you little kiddies ain't no challenge to me."

PKMY: *She closed her eyes and pushed her arms forward, releasing a metallic scraping sound.* "Not a challenge?"

Lance: *He leant back, staring at the blades in PKMY's hands in shock.* "What-?"

PKMY: "They're coming!" *She opened her eyes, ignoring the splinter of sparks with covered her arms.*

Holland: "They're cool, hey?"

Lance: "W-Wat the hell are they!?"

PKMY: "Huh?" *She looked at her weapons in confusion, raising an eyebrow.* "Haven't you seen them before?"

Lance: "Obviously." *He rolled his eyes as if PKMY was an idiot.*

PKMY: "They're called Ryukku-"

*Twenty Darkwings sprinted out of the dirt cloud and towards PKMY, Lance and Holland, catching their attention.*

PKMY: "Guess I'll show you two what they can do-" *She jumped forward and ran towards the Darkwings with her arms swaying by her sides.*

Lance: "Well, I'll show you wat my awesome lightnin' ice sword thingys can do!"

Holland: "And I guess I'll show you what it takes to be Holland!" *He smirked and ran with Lance towards the Darkwings.*

Darkwing: "Skee-" *It sprinted towards PKMY while violently jabbing its claws into the ground to increase its speed.*

PKMY: *She straightened her arms and pointed the Ryukkus in front, jumping forward in a dive-like manner.* "Sonic Drilldriver."

*PKMY crossed her legs and spiralled like a torpedo, causing a distinctive twisting-like sound to be heard.*

Darkwing: *It leapt into the air and extended its arm, pointing it at PKMY.* "Skreah?" *The wind around PKMY caused its body to slightly alter course in mid-air.*

Lance: *He ran past PKMY, watching the Darkwing barely miss her.* (They were heading for a collision, why did it miss-?)

PKMY: "Heh-" *She jabbed the tips of the Ryukkus into the Darkwing's ribs and the swirling motion caused its body to suddenly shatter to pieces.*

Lance: (Whoa-) *He watched PKMY land with ease and flicked her wrists, spinning the Ryukkus like a fan's blade.*

Holland: "Amy, above you!"

PKMY: *She smirked and looked up, noticing a swarm of Darkwings in the air.* "I see them!" *She spun around and threw one of the Ryukkus into the air above her.* "Swift Storm."

Lance: "Idiot! Those don't look like throwin' weapons?!" *He grunted at PKMY who purposely ignored him.*

PKMY: "Heh." *She touched the Ryukku in her hand, causing a brown glyph to form around the other Ryukku in the air.*

Darkwing: *It flew in the air and a mechanical-like screech caught its attention.* "Skee-?"

PKMY: "Harh!" *A swarm of Ryukkus blasted towards the Darkwings.*

Lance: *He watched the Ryukkus jab into each of the Darkwings, causing strings of dust to rain down from puffing bones.* "How-?"

Holland: (She's amazing.) *He looked up, smiling in a proud manner.*

Lance: "I want one of them!" *He pointed at the weapon like a child, ignoring the raining bones, which cracked on the ground around him.*

PKMY: "Heh-" *She ran forward and jumped up towards the Ryukku which floated in the air.*

*PKMY grunted and caught the Ryukku with ease, slowly descending with a smirk.*

PKMY: *She gently landed on the ground, looking at Lance in confidence.* "What you think?"

Lance: *He flashstepped in front of PKMY and charged towards another cluster of Darkwings.* "Nah, check mine out!"

Darkwing: *It noticed Lance and shot out skeletal arrows.* "Skee."

Lance: "Roar with the skies might, THUNDER BOOM" *He punched forward and a blast of sound knocked the skeletal arrows back.*

Darkwing: *It watched the bones hit the ground, causing it to screech in frustration.* "Skrarh!"

PKMY: "Boring, showing me your weapons or an audible representation of your childish behaviour?"

Lance: "Shut up-" *He watched the Darkwing's bones crack, causing its skull to revert back to normal.*

PKMY: (It can swap its form between long range to short range, so it's not a one-way transformation.. Interesting..)

Lance: (Here it comes-)

Darkwing: "Skee!" *It sprinted towards Lance at incredible speeds.*

Lance: (Fast!-)

Darkwing: *It stepped into striking distance, standing on its hind legs.* "Skrarh!"

Lance: "Harh-" *He sliced downwards and twirled around.*

Darkwing: *Its body froze with a slash-like line of ice as lightning sparked in between its joints.* "Sk-k-k."

Lance: *He jumped past the Darkwing, slicing the ice sword through its skull.* "Aha-"

Darkwing: "Sk-?" *It looked behind it at Lance and squeaked, before puffing into dust.*

Lance: "Air Slash." *He sliced the ice sword across and a visible air slash pierced through the air.* "You're gone!"

Holland: *He watched the air slash cut straight through two nearby Darkwings.* (When did Lance get so diverse in his attacks?)

PKMY: (I reckon-)

Lance: "Wat did yas think of that?" *He smiled at himself, waving the ice swords in a childish manner.*

PKMY: *She looked to the side with boredom and watched the Darkwings puff into dust, faking a yawn.* "Well, I'm tired of seeing lightning-"

Lance: "But it's ice-?!"

PKMY: "Yawn-"

Lance: "Pssht, you can't just say yawn-"

PKMY: "Tired.."

Lance: *He stamped his foot like a child.* "Well, I'm bored of seein' your face!-"

Holland: "Is it our time to show off?"

Lance: "Ah, no." *He quickly spoke and straightened his arm behind his back.* "LIGHTNING BLAST"

*A thick stream of lightning shot through an approaching Darkwing, causing bones to shatter before turning to dust.*

PKMY: (I don't believe it.. Is the shithead really captain level?)

Holland: *He noticed hundreds of Darkwings sprinting from the entrance of the city, causing him to shout with urgency.* (There's too many!)

PKMY: *She quickly faced the entrance, grunting with a frown.* (Shit-)

Season: "This is not a good sight-" *He frowned and ignored the many screeches, which drowned the air.*

Lance: "Then, I'll use my Owgee-" *He spread his legs and focused his concentration.*

Season: (That boost in Neurons-) "We can't use any powerful techniques!"

PKMY: *Season's yells caught her attention.* "Oi, dickhead, we can't use anything strong!"

Lance: "Why? There's too many of 'em!" *He glanced at PKMY, ignoring the glittering ice around his face.*

PKMY: "Umm, the city, and the people in hiding?!"

Lance: *He gritted his teeth in frustration and hesitantly nodded his head.* "Fine."

Holland: *He ran next to Lance and stared at the incoming Darkwings.* "There's nine of us and hundreds of them. Do you two have a plan?"

PKMY: "No-"

*Yells of men and women echoed from the dirt cloud, causing the entire party to stare at it in confusion.*

Tyler: "What was that?"

Joy: "That was certainly no screech."

PKMY: *She squinted her eyes, focusing on her emotions.* "They weren't yells of pain."

Lance: "They weren't?"

Holland: *He shook his head in a serious manner, staring at the dirt cloud with heightened vision.* (Are they-?)

*Warriors ran out of the dirt cloud and charged towards the party, causing Lance to grunt in shock.*

Lance: "Warriors?!" *He firmly held onto the ice swords, causing the movement of the lightning to become thicker.*

Holland: "Not good-" *He spoke to himself in a worried manner, placing a hand on his chest and markings.* "Ha!-"

*Holland punched forward, causing an expanding purple glyph to rotate in front of him.*

Freya: *She pounced out of the glyph and landed on all fours, looking back to PKMY, Lance and Holland.* "Ruff!"

*Joy, Chrisma and Alicia gasped in shock, staring at the warriors in confusion.*

Tyler: "What are they doing?"

Alicia: "N-No." *She spoke under her breath, shaking her head in disbelief.*

Season: *His shocked face turned into a smirk.* "Well, would you look at that-"

Warrior: "Harh!" *She spun around and slashed a nearby Darkwing, shattering its arm.*

Tyler: "W-Why?"

Cameron: *His image appeared in front of the scattering warriors.* "For this city!"

*Cameron raised his sword and yelled, causing the warriors to yell back.*

Cameron: "Harr!" *He flashstepped next to a Darkwing and jabbed the sword into its body, watching it puff into dust.* "Humph-"

*Cameron flashstepped again, avoiding several Darkwings which lunged themselves at him.*

Twenty-Six: *She grabbed the sword with both hands and ran towards two Darkwings.* "You dare attack the warriors?! Your head will roll-" *She lunged the sword into the skull of the Darkwing, causing her to laugh.*

Darkwing: *It screeched in pain, suddenly puffing into dust around the warrior's sword.* "Sk-"

Twenty-Six: "I'm near vice-captain level-"

Darkwing: *It twirled to the side and dropped down, slashing her armour.* "Skee."

Twenty-Six: "Dammit-"

Darkwing: "Skra!" *It spun around, kicking the warrior off her feet.*

Twenty-Six: "Argh-"

Cameron: *He flashstepped and caught her in one arm, pointing his sword at the Darkwing.* "Humph-"

Freya: *She dived from the air and landed on the Darkwing in front of Cameron, causing its bones to smash under her paws.* (Aerial Pounce.)

Cameron: *Dust blew in front of him.* (Good work.) *His voice spoke in Freya's mind, causing her to look at him in shock.*

Freya: (Thank you-)

Cameron: "Behind you!" *He shouted, looking past Freya.* "Help us out!"

Apollo: *He materialised in the air and dived behind Freya, slicing several Darkwings with his wings.* "Squawk!"

Twenty-Six: "Air Slash." *She slashed the air behind Cameron, cutting off a Darkwing's head.*

Cameron: "Excellent work."

Tyler: "Th-They're on our side?!"

Chrisma: "Get in!?"

*Several warriors ran past Lance, Holland and PKMY and up to Season.*

Seventy-Eight: "We're here to help fight alongside you, sir!" *He grunted in respect.*

Joy: "Season?" *She sounded unsure.*

Season: "It's fine, Joy. Help us protect the city!"

Seventy-Eight: "Sir!" *He turned around, raising a sword in a defensive manner.*

Lance: "Those warrior scum-"

PKMY: "Let's not get stupid, we need the help."

Lance: "Tssk, wateva." *He ran towards a cluster of Darkwings, slashing the ice swords at passing Darkwings.*

Darkwing: "Skree-" *Its legs shattered off in ice, suddenly bursting into a dust cloud of electricity.*

Holland: (That's seriously the best weapon I've ever seen! Nathan would be jealous-)

Lance: *He spun around, causing a ring of lightning to string around him.* "LIGHTNING PULSE"

*Lance spread both arms and the ring of lightning pulsed around him, causing the surrounding Darkwings to burst into dust.*

Sixty-Four: *He slammed a battle axe against a Darkwing's skull, cracking the bone.* "Grrr-"

Darkwing: *It gripped on the axe with both arms.* "Skree." *It slowly pushed the axe away and its skull cracked, forming into a bow.*

Sixty-Four: "No, you pathetic-"

Darkwing: *It shot a large skeletal arrow through the warrior's chest, pushing the warrior away.* "Skree."

Sixty-Four: "Urgh-" *He coughed out blood, staggering back.*

Darkwing: "Skeree!" *It screeched in victory and stepped back, looking to each side for a new target.*

Lance: *He ran in between another cluster of Darkwings and smirked.* "LIGHTNING PULSE"

Darkwing: "Skree-?"

Lance: *He clapped his hands and a blue ring of lightning rumbled like thunder around him.* "Yea, take this!"

*Lance pushed his arms to each side and the blue ring pulsed, exploding the nearby Darkwings.*

PKMY: "Good thing these break in one hit."

Holland: *He punched a Darkwing, causing its bones to crack into dust around his fist.* "I think it's just us taking them more seriously now-"

PKMY: *She pointed the Ryukkus at three charging Darkwings.* "I guess-" *She paused and tilted her head on the side.* "Huh?"

*The Darkwings held each other's hands and the shadows which swirled around their bodies grew darker.*

PKMY: "Wat?"

Holland: (Their shadows?)

*The Darkwing's bones connected and their bodies grew in size, causing PKMY to step back.*

PKMY: "They're-? Wat?!" (Their skeletons merged into one entity-)

*The Darkwing slowly stood up and opened its bright yellow eyes, towering over PKMY.*

PKMY: (They're three times larger than-)

Darkwing: "Skree!" *It reached out and its arm extended towards PKMY.*

PKMY: "Tssk-" *She crossed the Ryukkus in a defensive manner.* "Shit-"

*The Darkwing's arm slammed onto the Ryukkus, causing sparks to scatter.*

PKMY: "Argh-" *Her feet scraped along the ground.*

Holland: *He watched the Darkwing push PKMY back.* "No! Freya!"

Freya: *Her ear twitched and she looked at PKMY and Holland.* (Got it! Tangrowth Slash.) *Her claws extended like vines and pierced through the air towards the giant Darkwing.*

PKMY: *She gritted her teeth, continuing to slide back.* (I can't stop, the ground isn't sturdy enough with these boots-)

Darkwing: "Skree!"

PKMY: *She came to a halt as several claws jabbed into the Darkwing's back.* (Thank you.)

Darkwing: *It looked down, noticing dust pour from Freya's claws.* "Sk-k-k?" *Its body suddenly disintegrated into dust, causing Freya's vine-like claws to sway in the air.*

Freya: *Her claws whipped and retracted, reverting back to normal.* "Ruff-"

*Clusters of Darkwings started to connect into each other, forming larger variants with a louder screech.*

Holland: *He looked up and formed a fist.* "I don't care what shape or form you take, you'll face the same end!-"

*Holland ran towards the Darkwing and stepped into striking distance, raising the fist to his face.*

Holland: "Harh!" *He punched the Darkwing in the stomach and several bones cracked.*

Darkwing: "Skree?" *It felt its stomach and looked at Holland with squinted eyes as if it was frowning.*

Holland: (It didn't work-?) *He stepped back in shock.* (It's much stronger-)

Darkwing: "Sk-" *It raised its arm and quickly slammed it into Holland's chest, throwing him back.* "Skree!"

Holland: "Ah-" *He tumbled back, covering his chest with both hands.*

Darkwing: "Skree!" *It quickly extended its arm and grabbed onto Holland's leg, throwing him up into the air.*

Holland: "Crud-?!"

Darkwing: "Skrarh!" *It formed a fist and punched Holland back.*

Holland: *He slid back with great force, watching his toes scrape on the ground.* (How did it get so strong-?!)

Fryfry: *Several fireflies crossed paths and formed a red glass-like reflective shield.* (Myrror Shield.)

Holland: *He hit the shield and came to a complete stop, coughing in shock.* "Thanks." *He stepped forward and shook his head, cueing the shield to shatter behind him.*

Fryfry: "Bzzzst." *They hovered around Holland as they swarmed out of a red glyph.*

Warrior: *He watched the Darkwings merge into larger entities, noticing their idle-like movement.* (They're not attacking-) "Move back!"

Season: (Besides the creatures that have already merged, they appear to be motionless in the merging process?)

Cameron: *He flashstepped next to the warrior, observing the new Darkwings' form.* "That is the best course of action!"

*The warriors responded to Cameron's voice and moved back in defensive manners.*

Joy: "They somehow merged into one."

Season: "Several of these new forms are no longer destroyed in one Rostical attack. Maybe they're three times as strong?" *He mumbled to himself, analysing a growing Darkwing.*

Tyler: "Even with the unexpected warriors' help, even this might not be enough."

Freya: *She jumped forward and glided above the ground to Holland.* (My stomach badly hurts, are you okay?)

Holland: *He rubbed his stomach in pain, nodding his head as if he didn't want people to know.* "Yes.."

Alicia: *She ran past the warriors and up to Holland, biting her bottom lip.* "H-Here-"

Holland: "You shouldn't be here-"

Alicia: "HEALING RINGS" *She closed her eyes and rings of light spiralled around Holland's stomach.*

Freya: *She opened her jaw in shock, staring at the light in amazement.* (My stomach is feeling at ease!)

Lance: *He ran towards a Darkwing which towered over him, slashing the ice sword across.* "Hah!"

Darkwing: *It swung its arm in the opposite direction, smashing the ice swords to the side.* "Skree!"

Lance: *He paused with a dropping jaw, watching the ice roll across the ground.* "Umm-?"

*Fluid-like streams of fluoro yellow lightning swirled up the Darkwing, causing it to screech in pain.*

Lance: "Huh?" *He looked up, watching the Darkwing suddenly puff into dust.* "Aha, that's wat you get for breakin' my magic swords."

Holland: *He smirked, placing his hand on Alicia's shoulder.* "Appreciate it."

Alicia: *The light stopped glowing, causing her to step back.* "There."

*Different animal roars echoed from outside the city, catching the warrior and party's attention.*

Lance: "Gah, wat is it now?" *He glanced at the entrance and back to an approaching Darkwing, watching it tower over him.*

Holland: *A heartbeat-like pulse caused his eyes to widen.* "This feeling-"

Freya: *She wagged her tail in a friendly manner, facing the entrance.* "Ruff."

*The Darkwings finished merging and started to move, suddenly attacking nearby warriors.*

Lance: (Shit, they're movin' again-) "LIGHTNING-"

Darkwing: *Its arms extended and moved in a strange manner, catching Lance off guard.* "Skree."

Lance: *He gritted his teeth and looked from side to side, trying to follow the Darkwing's arm.* (It's double jointed, I can't see when it's gonna attack me!-)

PKMY: "Are you stupid?!" *She yelled at Lance and sprinted towards him.* "There's a reason why it hasn't attacked you yet!"

Lance: "W-Wat are you talkin'-?"

PKMY: *She backflipped and jumped behind Lance with her back facing his.* "This-" *She crossed her Ryukku and bent her knees, standing in a defensive manner.*

Darkwing: *It suddenly landed on the ground in front of PKMY, instantly shooting out a massive skeletal arrow.* "Skree."

PKMY: *She blocked the arrow and was pushed back into Lance, causing sparks to scatter off her Ryukkus.* (This is getting fun-)

Lance: *He gasped to himself in realisation, keeping a fixated stare on the Darkwing in front of him.* (There was one behind me?!)

PKMY: *She gritted her teeth and slashed to the side, knocking the massive bone to the ground.* (Heh-)

*PKMY smirked and rudely pushed herself off Lance, causing him to stumble forward.*

Lance: "Oi-" *He grunted at PKMY and quickly gasped as the Darkwing in front slammed its fist on top of him.*

Alicia: "Lance!" *She intensely stared at the Darkwing, watching its shadow swirl in the area around Lance.* (I can't see him!-)

Lance: *His image appeared in a safe distance.* "I-I'm all good-" *He panted as sweat dripped down the side of his head.*

Alicia: *She nodded her head and cupped her pendant, sighing in relief.* (Lance, you need to be more careful!-)

PKMY: *She spiralled in the air above the Darkwing, avoiding its slashing arms.* "Yahoo!"

Darkwing: "Skree!" *It screeched in frustration, trying to grab PKMY from the air.*

PKMY: *She dived down, violently jabbing the Ryukkus into the Darkwing's skull.* "I'm not finished!"

*PKMY rocked her legs back and pushed herself downwards, slashing the Ryukkus through the Darkwing's body until she touched the ground.*

Darkwing: "Sk-kree?" *It looked down at PKMY and stumbled back with a loss of balance.*

PKMY: "How does it feel to be sliced in half? Heh."

Darkwing: "Ski-" *Its bones instantaneously cracked and two parts of its body tumbled to each side before fading into dust.*

PKMY: "Whoo-" *She swayed the weapons like a fan above her head, causing swirls of dust to spiral around her.*

Lance: "I rekon we should just use strong attacks-" *He shouted at PKMY, glancing at the large Darkwings.* "'Cause these things are gonna destroy the city anyways!-"

PKMY: (Good point-)

?????: *A man with a fox's face, stamped out of the dirt cloud.* "Harh!" *He flashstepped in the air above a Darkwing's head.*

Darkwing: "Skree." *It looked up at the man and extended its legs, causing it to stand above the fox-like man.*

?????: "Harh." *He ignored the towering Darkwing and punched in front, causing the Darkwing's stomach to explode from the back.*

Lance: *He squinted his eyes and stared at the man covered in fur in confusion.* "Wat the-?"

Darkwing: *It looked down, noticing the large hole in its stomach.* "Skree-"

?????: "Sonic Roar." *He opened his jaw and roared like a lion, causing visible shockwaves to explode the Darkwing into dust.*

Lance: (That guy.. He's hairy?)

?????: "Gr-argh." *He landed heavily on his feet and looked around, glancing across the city with heightened vision.*

*Men and women of animal appearance flashstepped behind the man, catching the party's attention.*

Season: "What is that?"

Tyler: "A Scoldrant?"

Chrisma: "Maybe the Scoldrants are helping the Darkwings?"

Alicia: "But, it destroyed one-?"

Holland: *He smirked.* "It's the chief."

PKMY: "The chief?"

Chief: *He stamped forward and glanced at the Darkwings.* "Fellow, brethren! Allow us to aid you!"

Warrior: *She ran up to Sixty-Four and bent down, holding him in her arms.* "More enemies just arrived!"

Sixty-Four: *He lay in a pool of blood and stared at the chief, shaking his head.* "G-Gah-" *He gargled blood, frowning at the chief in disgust.* "A Scoldrant human? A freak-"

Frog-Woman: *She flashstepped above the warrior and Sixty-Four.* "Moisture's density, burst-"

Warrior: *She looked up at the frog-woman, holding Sixty-Four in a defensive manner.* "No!"

Frog-Woman: "BUBBLE BLAST" *She hiccuped two bubbles of water and blew them downwards, watching them shoot through two small Darkwings.*

Warrior: "H-Huh?" *She gasped in shock, watching the Darkwings' bones suddenly puff into dust.*

Sixty-Four: (It saved us?!) *His eyes widened in shock.*

Alicia: *She noticed the warrior sitting in a pool of blood, causing her to run towards him.* (I have to heal all of our allies!)

Tyler: *He stood with Joy and Chrisma, watching the warriors fight the Darkwings.* "This is disorientating-"

*Four small Darkwings sprinted past the party and towards Joy, Chrisma and Tyler.*

Chrisma: "N-No-"

Joy: "Chrisma, lend me your Neurons-"

Chrisma: "Hmhmm-" *She held Joy's hand and they closed their eyes.*

Joy and Chrisma: "MYSTIC SHIELD" *They sung on a high note and a silver shield rose around them.*

Tyler: *He watched two Darkwings hit the shield in front of him, causing him to step back in shock.* "W-Will it hold?"

Joy: "Depends how strong these creat-"

Darkwing: "Skree!" *It violently rammed its nails into the shield, causing it to crack like glass.*

Whitehead: "Oh, no you don't!" *He jumped off the bridge and stabbed the two Darkwings with a large red cutlass sword in each hand.*

Joy: "W-Who-?"

Chrisma: "Whitehead! Get in! Whoup whoup-"

Whitehead: "Hahahah, ahoy, argh!" *He smirked in a proud manner, watching the Darkwings puff into dust around his cutlass swords.*

*Whitehead's men, ran down the stairs and onto the road-like path, catching Lance's attention.*

Lance: (So like wat, pirates are helpin' us out now?) *He snickered in thought, watching the bandits ram their cutlass swords into a small Darkwing.* (Well, that showed me..)

Chief: *He flashstepped next to Holland and focused his attention on a Darkwing, watching it slowly crawl towards them.* "Hermm."

Holland: "W-What are you doing here?"

PKMY: "He's on a vacation, can we talk after?!" *She bent to the side and swayed her arms, skilfully twirling the Ryukkus in her hands.*

Darkwing: "Skree!" *It screeched in PKMY's face, causing her to grunt with a frown.*

PKMY: "Harh!" *She cut the Darkwing in half and spun around, quickly slicing downwards.*

Darkwing: "Skri-" *The force of PKMY's attack pushed it back.*

Chief: "The lass is right." *He growled in an animal-like manner, watching the Darkwing break into four pieces.*

PKMY: "Lass?!"

Lance: "LIGHTNING BLAST" *He shot a stream of thick lightning through the skull of a large Darkwing.* "Nah, get it right, it's Docta Jingles!"

PKMY: "You!-"

Chief: "Hickhick." *He chuckled with a purr, watching five Darkwings fly towards PKMY.*

PKMY: "Tssk-" *She bent down and stood in a battle-ready pose, crossing the Ryukkus over her face.*

Freya: *She pounced next to a group of warriors and growled at a charging Darkwing.* "Grr-"

Warrior: "Are you helping us too?" *He grunted at Freya and faced the charging Darkwing, causing his armour to rattle.*

Freya: "Ruff!"

Warrior: "Great!" *He pointed the sword in front, as he nervously waited for the Darkwing to come into striking distance.*

Whitehead: "Are you lot OK?" *He looked over his shoulder, grunting at Chrisma through the shield.*

Tyler: "B-Behind you!"

Whitehead: "H-Argh?" *He looked up and noticed the two other Darkwings in striking distance.*

Season: "WATER'S PULSE, FIRE'S PULSE" *He pushed both arms forward and a ring of water and fire exploded the two Darkwings.*

Whitehead: "G-Garh?" *He froze in shock, watching two dust clouds swirl in a pulse of water and flames.* "Y-You helped-?"

Season: "At the moment, you're an ally, enough can be said."

Whitehead: "A-Argh." *He laughed it off and raised the swords, preparing himself to attack another Darkwing.*

Alicia: *She stood next to the warrior and took deep breaths, readying herself.* "HEALING-"

Warrior: "W-What are you-?"

Alicia: "-RINGS" *She cupped her hands and focused, causing bright white rings of light to spiral around Sixty-Four.*

Sixty-Four: "M-My damage, it's healing!?"

Warrior: *She stared at the rings in amazement.* "They're healing my cuts too!"

*Holland and the chief raised their fists, charging for the Darkwing.*

Holland: "Harh!"
Chief: "Growlith!"

Darkwing: "Skreeha-" *It screeched for intimidation, watching the chief and Holland punch its body in two.*

Holland: *He watched the Darkwing's body puff into two dirt clouds, causing him to look at the chief in a puzzled manner.* "Why did it stand there and let us attack it?" *He brushed dust off his knuckles.*

Chief: *He looked at Holland with a friendly purr.* "It didn't expect us to do such damage."

Holland: "What do you mean?"

Chief: *He pointed at his fox-like eyes and grinned, showing his razor sharp teeth.* "Nothing can fool these eyes."

Holland: *He smirked and nodded his head.* "One day, I hope my eyes gain your power-" *He suddenly bent over in pain, coughing out blood.*

Chief: "W-What?! Nothing hit you-" *He blinked and observed the Soul Link, causing him to instantly look over his shoulder.*

Darkwing: "Skree-" *It ripped its arm out of Freya's stomach.*

Warrior: "How dare you!" *She jumped up and cut the Darkwing's arm, slicing into its bone.* (No!-) *She stepped forward and struggled with a grunt, trying to cut through the bone.* (The sword is stuck! I'm not strong enough-)

Chief: *He flashstepped next to the warrior, placing his hands on her arm.* "May I help you?"

Warrior: *She nervously nodded her head, causing her armour to rattle.* "Y-Yes.."

Chief: *He growled at the Darkwing, applying pressure on the warrior's armour.* "Grr."

Darkwing: *It watched the sword slowly slice deeper into its bone, causing it to screech and raise its other arm.* "Skree-"

Warrior and Chief: "Arh!" *The sword hit the ground, causing a flash of small sparks to scatter.*

Darkwing: *It extended its claws and aimed its fingers at the chief and the warrior.* "Skree-"

Twenty-Six: *She sprinted in front of the chief and warrior.* "It'll have to get through me first!"

Warrior: *She stared at Twenty-Six's back, looking at her in shock.* "C-Captain-"

Cameron: *He flashstepped next to Twenty-Six.* "And me-"

Chief: *His eyes widened in shock.* (That man's power is the same as mine if not stronger!)

Darkwing: "Skaree!" *It screeched and shot out several bone shards from its fingertips.*

Cameron: *He lowered his head and raised his sword, keeping it still.* "Humph-"

Chief: (Those projectiles will hit!-)

Cameron: *He moved his wrist at amazing speeds and blue sparks scattered off his sword.* "Pathetic."

Chief: "What-?" *He glanced to the side, noticing shards of bone splintering past him.* (Amazing! He blocked the projectiles at blinding speeds.)

Cameron: "Air Slash."

Twenty-Six: "Azure Burst." *She unsheathed a long sword from her back and focused, watching the air warp and grow around the sword.*

Warrior: (Ever since we encountered Season at that village.. She's changed-)

Twenty-Six: "Hard Blade." *She jabbed forward, causing the aura-like sword to pierce into the massive Darkwing.*

Darkwing: "Skeree!"

Warrior: *She smiled to herself in thought, ignoring the sounds of bone hitting the ground.* (But, for the best-)

Cameron: "Hmph." *He lined the sword up with the Darkwing and slashed upwards, causing its arm to violently shatter off into the air.*

Twenty-Six: *She stepped back in a military manner and spun around, slashing downwards.* "Streaming Sword."

Chief: *He watched a slash-like stream of lightning shatter several of the Darkwing's ribs.* (The warriors..)

Cameron: "Triple Slash." *He sliced downwards once, causing three major bones to burst on the Darkwing.*

Chief: (They.. Fight for us?) *He thought to himself in shock and stared at the warriors with widening eyes, watching the back of their armour shimmer in the light.*

Darkwing: "Skree!-"

Cameron: "Here is another! Air Slash."

Twenty-Six: *She nodded her head at Cameron and focused on the Darkwing, causing her body to glow a shade of blue.* "Aqua Stroke."

Chief: *He proudly walked in between the warriors, pointing his nails out.* "Tangrowth Slash."

Darkwing: "Skree." *Its other arm shattered off its body from a violent air slash, causing its bones to puff into dust.* "Skree!-"

*A slash-like stream of water burst against its legs, shattering its knees.*

Darkwing: "Skree!-" *Ten vine-like nails jabbed into its body, causing it to screech in a frozen-like state.*

Chief: "Growlith!" *He growled like an animal and quickly spread his fingers, breaking the Darkwing into many pieces.*

Cameron: "Hmph." *He grunted in respect, glancing at the chief with an emotionless face.* "It would have been troublesome fighting you."

Twenty-Six: *She lowered her long sword, flicking water off it in confusion.* "Captain?"

Chief: "Hickhick, it's good being an ally too." *He chuckled in a purr-like manner, focusing his attention to other nearby Darkwings.*

Alicia: "With the divine power of the holy spirits, scattering light, HEALING RINGS" *She cupped her hands and closed her eyes, causing swirls of materialising light to appear around Freya.*

Freya: *White rings spiralled around her, causing Holland to sigh in relief.* "Grr?"

Alicia: (It's taking its time-) *She envisioned Freya's wound slowly closing.* (I could heal this instantly if I-) *She shook her head in concentration.* (No, this is fine...)

Freya: *She stood up on all fours and looked down, staring at the blood she left on the ground.* (Alicia? Thank you.)

Holland: *He coughed and stood up, looking at Alicia in appreciation.* "She says thanks, Alicia!"

Alicia: *She opened her eyes and smiled.* "Tee hee, you're welcome!"

Freya: "Ruff!" *The light of the rings faded, causing her to wag her tail.*

*The warrior and chief looked behind them at Freya completely healed.*

Lance: *He glanced around and smiled.* "Oi, Docta Jingles, ogre! The bone things are almost gone!"

Holland: *He scanned the area, smiling in realisation.* (He's right!)

PKMY: *She ran next to Holland and stared at Lance.* "You're able to count them on your two hands? Are you proud?"

Lance: "Ah, shuddup."

Season: (Due to merging and growing in size their numbers reduced-)

Tyler: "Oh, no!" *He looked behind him and noticed several small Darkwings, running into the castle.* "I'll go get them!"

Season: *He looked confused and stared at Tyler.* "Don't, they're too dangerous!-"

*A large Darkwing shot several shards of bone into Season's back, causing him to gag in mid-sentence.*

Season: *He hunched forward, grunting in pain.* "Kah-"

Joy: "Season!" *She screamed, causing Lance to look in her general direction.*

Lance: *He glanced around Joy, shaking his head in confusion.* (We've nearly defeated them all, why are people screamin'?)

Tyler: *He gasped and turned around, facing Season in shock and concern.* "Seas!-"

Season: "Grr-" *He awkwardly faced the Darkwing that shot the projectiles at him.*

Darkwing: "Skree!" *It glared at Season, watching another skeletal arrow jab out of its head.*

Joy: "Go!" *She shouted at Tyler, waving him off.* "Chrisma and I will handle this!"

Season: (Go? Why is Joy telling Tyler to-?) *He paused in thought as if the pain immobilised him.*

Tyler: *He nodded his head and tightly held onto the RPG bag, frowning in determination.* "G-Got it!" *He faced the castle and started to run towards it.*

Whitehead: *He looked at Season, raising a cutlass sword into the air.* "Argh, this man might give us our merchandise, let's not let him die, boys!"

*The pirate-like men roared and charged towards the Darkwing, catching Joy's attention.*

Joy: (Are these the same bandits I once encountered before?)

Lance: "Will you guys be right?"

PKMY: "Guys?"

Holland: "Haha, yeah, we can hold our own."

PKMY: "Yeah, shitface, don't get all caring on us." *She punched a fist in her hand and smirked.*

Lance: "Aha, wateva." *He smiled and ran towards the castle.*

PKMY: *She quickly scanned the area and looked up, noticing several Darkwings high in the air.* "He wasn't wrong, we've somehow nearly got them all."

Holland: *He smirked and stared in the air, causing the purple ring to spiral around his iris, magnifying his vision.* "We need aerial support!-"

Destiny: *She flew out of a yellow glyph which instantly materialised and spiralled in the air.* (Holland?)

Holland: "In the air!" *He shouted with an angry tone, enthusiastically pointing up.*

Destiny: (Got it.) *She sneezed and flapped her wings, blasting high into the air.*

Chrisma: "Ougi." *She cupped her hands and sung, causing the area to slightly dim.* "HEALING RINGS" *Symbols appeared around her body and small rings glowed around Season.*

Season: *His eyes reflected the light caused by Chrisma's Ougi.* (Light, it always surprises me.. It's power and beauty-)

Joy: *She noticed Chrisma buckle at the knees.* "Here, let me help you-" *She grabbed Chrisma's hand and closed her eyes, causing Chrisma to stand up straight.*

Tyler: *He grunted, as he awkwardly ran in the middle of the road-like path towards the castle.* (I hope those things don't attack any of the innocent bystanders!)

*Tyler triggered mental images of people in the research facility being attacked, causing him to run faster.*

Lance: *He suddenly appeared next to Tyler and ran with him, focusing his attention to the castle.* "Bein' a hero ain't your thing, Tyler."

Tyler: "And you are?" *He mumbled in a sarcastic manner, causing Lance to roll his eyes.*

Lance: "Yea, thanks."

Tyler: "I was being sarcastic."

Lance: "Wat's the point of sarcasm if it's the truth?" *He looked at Tyler, sticking out his tongue.*

Tyler: "You're still a loser, Lance."

Lance: "That right, quick fingers?"

Tyler: "N-Not you too!"

Lance: "Aha!" *He grinned immaturely and ran across the grass, jumping through the castle's doors.*

Tyler: *He awkwardly ran through the doors, watching them ripple around him.* "Lance-, ah-?" *He stumbled into the back of Lance and shuffled away, watching him stand on the spot in confusion.*

Lance: "Umm, I was gonna charge in, but-" *He glanced down the hallway and to the stairs, before looking at Tyler.* "Where do we go?"

Tyler: "Let's scan every floor and work our way up."

Lance: "Got it." *He stepped to the side and faced Tyler, silently staring at him.* "Well?"

Tyler: "Well, what?"

Lance: "You know this castle better than me."

Tyler: "Ah-" *He looked past Lance down the hallway, nervous stuttering in fear.* "U-Umm?"

Lance: *He rolled his eyes and reached out, watching electricity stream in between his fingers.* "It's all good-"

Tyler: (The hallways look darker than normal-)

Lance: *He clicked his fingers, causing a string of lightning to form itself into a sword.* "Let's go-"

*Screeches echoed throughout the castle, causing Lance to look alert.*

Tyler: *He gasped and held onto Lance.* "That came from just down the h-hallway."

Lance: "You see this." *He swayed the lightning in front of him, causing the stair's rails to reflect its light.* "You've got nothin' to worry 'bout, aye."

Tyler: *He stepped back and looked at the lightning, nodding his head.* "I'm not worrying!"

*Tyler stealthily jogged past Lance and down the hallway, peaking in each room.*

Lance: *He stared at Tyler and chuckled to himself.* (I remember this same little shit used to be scared at servin' old ladies, now look at him-)

Tyler: "I just checked all the rooms, there was nothing in-"

Darkwing: *It dived out of the room and tackled Tyler along the polished floor.* "Skree."

Tyler: "A-Ah! Get o-off!" *He squealed and swayed to each side, trying to push the Darkwing off.*

Darkwing: "Skree!"

Lance: "Shit-" *He grunted to himself and ran towards Tyler and the Darkwing.*

Tyler: *He rammed his hand into the RPG bag.* "I said get off-" *He threw an orange ball into the air.* "Paralysing Vapours!"

*The ball exploded and an orange dust cloud floated in the air, causing the Darkwing to screech in a sneeze-like manner.*

Darkwing: "Sk-k-k?" *Its body locked up, causing its head to twitch in an owl-like manner.*

Lance: "Tyler?" *He noticed the orange dust cloud and stopped, stepping back in shock.*

Tyler: "If it has senses, then it's paralysed. Get it now-" *He quickly covered his nose and mouth, holding his breath.*

Lance: "Harh!" *He slashed the sword across and a visible air slash sliced the Darkwing off Tyler.*

Darkwing: "Sk-k-k." *It screeched with a stutter as its skull fell off its shoulders.*

Tyler: *He whacked the bones off his body like a girl and quickly stood up, looking down in disgust.* (Jeez, there's dust on me-)

Lance: "Was that it?" *He looked around, grunting in concern.*

Tyler: *He faced Lance, noticing the floors shine from the lightning.* "No, I saw about six enter."

Lance: "Right, to the next level-" *He faced the stairs and ran towards them.*

Tyler: "R-Right!"

----------

Joy: (There's one left-) *She looked at PKMY, Holland, Alicia, Season, Chrisma, Cameron, Whitehead, the chief, several warriors, pirate-like crew and several Scoldrant-like humans.*

*The massive party stared at an abnormally large Darkwing which was the size of a two storey house.*

Joy: "We shouldn't be clustered like this-"

PKMY: *She gritted her teeth and frowned.* "Can we use a high powered technique yet?"

Season: *He stood up straight, due to Chrisma's Ougi.* "No!-"

PKMY: "Use a Solar Flare-"

Season: "No."

Whitehead: *He frowned, scraping his cutlass swords together as if he was sharpening them.* "We can't damage this city, this is our home."

Bug-eyed Man: "We agreezz."

Cameron: "The sturdiness of its bones doubles with every merge. It has merged three times to become that."

Chrisma: "Then what will we do?"

Chief: "Use force?" *He growled, showing off his teeth.*

PKMY: "Obviously."

Alicia: "Can't we just focus our combined power and use weak attacks?"

Twenty-Six: *She quickly observed the party.* "We'll get in each other's way."

Cameron: "She is right." (I prefer to fight alone.)

*Apollo and Freya flew in the air as they waited for an opening to strike the Darkwing.*

Holland: "What about just focusing on its head?"

Cameron: "Explain the diagnostics to this plan?"

Holland: "Use a powerful technique and if we miss, it goes straight into the air?"

Season: "That's a splendid idea."

PKMY: "Stuff this! It's still growing in size!-" *She threw one of the Ryukkus on the ground and straightened her arm.* "Ougi."

Lizard-tongued Woman: "An Owgi?" *She looked intrigued, speaking in a snake-like manner.*

PKMY: *She opened her hand and braced herself, ramming the Ryukku through it.* "Incantation Exploitation."

Chrisma: "Get in!-" *She gasped in fright as if she wasn't expecting PKMY to stab herself.*

*The chief and tribal members looked at each other in shock, focusing all their attention on PKMY.*

Alicia: "Ougi?" *She whispered to herself in surprise, biting her bottom lip.*

PKMY: *She threw the Ryukku to her side, causing it to slide across the ground.* "Let's see wat its reaction will be?"

*Cameron and Holland felt their tribal markings in shock, causing them to glance at PKMY with surprised faces.*

Cameron: (This woman, is she a Scoldrant User too?)

PKMY: *She smirked and squinted her eyes.* (Since it's still too busy forming itself from its last merge, I'll just attack it now-)

Alicia: "PKMY-"

PKMY: "Blah bah doobly blarh-FLAMING WHEEL, GLACIA'S EDGE, AIR CUTTER, ICICLE EDGE"

Cameron: "Preposterous, using Rostical without the incantation against something so large is-"

PKMY: *She sprinted towards the Darkwing intentionally ignoring Cameron.* "Heh-"

Joy: "He's right, that creature is at least six storeys high now!"

PKMY: *She jumped high into the air, causing the pirate-like men to gasp in amazement.* (I'm getting a little tired, so I need to pay attention to how many times I flashstep, or my legs will cramp up-)

Darkwing: "Skrarrr." *Its last bone connected cueing it to start moving.*

PKMY: (Too late-) *A visible air blade blasted down and hit the Darkwing's shoulder, causing a small explosion of bones and dust to swirl in the air.*

Darkwing: "Skrarr?!" *Fire swirled around its feet and suddenly blasted up around its waist.*

PKMY: "HEAT LANCE" *She pushed forward and four fire lances burnt through the air, suddenly erupting around the Darkwing's face.*

Chrisma: *She gasped with a groan, raising an arm over her face.* (It's bright.)

Cameron: (The Rasticsplash of those attacks were as if the incantation was used?!)

Darkwing: *The shadow around its body swirled, trying to extinguish the flames.* "Skraarh-"

Cameron: (They can control their shadow-like body armour?!)

*Ice spears formed in the air above PKMY and blasted down into the flames, causing bone-like cracking sounds to be heard.*

Cameron: *He squinted his eyes, staring through the fire with heightened vision.* (Ignoring the flames as a variable, the Icicle Edge spears alone were strong enough to crack into its bone, how?)

Darkwing: "Skrarr-" *The shadow pulsed which instantly extinguished the flames.* "Shraar."

PKMY: "Blah bah blah! ICICLE EDGE" *She swayed her arms downwards and ice spears instantly plummeted towards the Darkwing.*

Darkwing: *It noticed several ice spears jab into its skull, watching them explode upon impact.* "Skreearrh." *It screeched and the shadow pulsed, shattering the ice spears.*

Season: (The speed in which she creates the ice spears and attacks, the quality of her Neurons have also improved-)

PKMY: *Several ice pillars blasted out from the ground and cracked the Darkwing's leg bones.* (Tssk-)

*PKMY descended and landed on the ground, spreading her legs to form a battle stance.*

PKMY: "AIR SWIRL, AIR CUTTER, AIR SWIRL, AIR CUTTER, HEAT LANCE, winds that be, power of might strike with fury, AIR CUTTER"

Darkwing: *It scanned the air and screeched, squinting its yellow eyes.* "Skrarh?" *It looked down, noticing the clustered party and PKMY.*

Bandit: "It looked at us, boss!" *He grunted, looking up in fear.*

Whitehead: "Keep your head up, argh! You're part of The Seaside Bandits!"

Darkwing: "Skrarh!" *Its large skull cracked and started to take shape of a bow.*

*A green visible air slash cut one of the Darkwing's leg, causing a stream of shadow to follow the wind behind it.*

Darkwing: "Skrarr-" *A visible air blade blasted down and hit the Darkwing's head, causing a miniature explosion of bones and dust to swirl above it.*

Joy: (A direct attack?)

Chrisma: "We did it, whoup whoup!-"

Joy: "Chrisma-" *She spoke under her breath in a calm manner, placing her hand on Chrisma's mouth.*

Chrisma: "Bless, sorry." *Her voice muffled through Joy's hand, nodding her head in understanding.*

*Another visible green air slash cut the other Darkwing's leg, causing a loud bone crack noise to echo.*

Darkwing: "Skkkararh-?"

*As the Darkwing started to lose its balance, another air blade blasted down and cracked more of its skull.*

Cameron: *He watched enormous bones shatter around the Darkwing's feet, causing him to grunt with widening eyes.* (Such a fluid combo-)

PKMY: (Hope this works, I can't grasp the power like Teresa, but this is how she does it!-)

*PKMY raised both arms above her head and four swirls of flames spiralled around her hands.*

PKMY: (By condensing and thinning the Neurons inside the element-) *She squinted her eyes as the flames grew in heat and brightness.* (-And by adjusting and manipulating the Astragons to the smallest degree-)

Bandit: "Boss-" *He grunted to catch Whitehead's attention, motioning his head at PKMY.*

PKMY: (With high enough level, one can do this-) *The fire started to take shape and began to swirl like a shuriken.*

Alicia: "P-PKMY?" *She spoke under her breath, admiring PKMY's battle stance.*

PKMY: "You're mine now! Harh!" *She stepped forward and threw the fire blade towards the Darkwing.*

Season: *He smiled in amazement, watching the fire blade spiral like a fan towards the Darkwing's head.* (She must've learnt it from Teresa!)

Darkwing: "Skree?" *It stepped back to dodge the fire blade, causing bones to loudly crack.*

Cameron: (Its legs! She planned this from the start of her Ougi!-)

Darkwing: *It screeched in a frozen-like manner, trying to move its legs.* "Skrarr!-"

PKMY: "Heh-"

*A massive explosion caused the Darkwing to instantly burst into dust, causing Holland to smirk in a proud manner.*

Chrisma: "Oh bless-" *The brightness of the flames caused her to squint her eyes.*

PKMY: *She smirked and inhaled deeply, glancing at the blood which ran down her fingers.* (Phew, that was satisfying.)

Holland: "Wow!" *He yelled in excitement and amazement.*

PKMY: "Huh?" *She watched Holland and Alicia run towards her.*

Whitehead: (I thought my Rosterology items were great, but after seeing that redhead's Rostical. It puts my items to shame.)

Alicia: "HEALING RINGS"

Cameron: *He had a flashback of Teresa using her Rostical against him.* (That was similar to her Serenity Swirl.) *He watched Alicia heal PKMY's wounds.*

Apollo: (I still believe you should have released me during that fight.)

Warrior: "We did it?" *He looked at the massive party, waiting for their response.*

*Rumbles vibrated along the ground, causing the party to look at each other in confusion.*

Whitehead: "What was that?"

Chrisma: "Another tremor?"

Alicia: *She looked worried and stared at the entrance.* "I think we should close the entrance somehow."

Cameron: "I will-"

*Loud screeches echoed and another swarm of Darkwings exploded through the entrance.*

Season: (Another swarm!?)

----------

Tyler: *He nervously held himself, staring at the ceiling.* (Most of the lights are out, so the castle is really scary right now-)

Lance: "This level is clear-" *He ran towards Tyler, who waited at the stairs.*

Tyler: "Then you've got the third floor and then the royal floor, then a floor I haven't been on yet-" *He turned around, looking up the stairs.* "And then the rooftop."

Lance: "Got it-" *He ran up the stairs with Tyler, suddenly motioning him to stop.* "Shh-"

Tyler: "What-?"

Lance: "Ssh-" *He took a deep breath and quickly jumped in the middle of the hallway.*

Tyler: *He looked at Lance in confusion.* "What are you doing?"

Lance: "You know in movies, how the creature like always attacks in your blind corner? Well, I figured if I jumped, I'd startle it. By the way, the hallway is cleared."

Tyler: *He smiled with a worried face and nodded his head.* "The research facility and the library are down the hall."

Lance: "Come on then." *He ran down the hallway, noticing light shine off the floors around him.*

Tyler: (I hope the researchers are okay.)

Lance: *He looked to his left and peaked into the research facility, causing him to quickly look at Tyler in shock.* "Come quick." *He whispered, motioning Tyler to come in an urgent manner.*

Tyler: *He held the RPG bag and ran up to Lance, glancing into the research facility.* "What-?" *He looked on the floor and noticed smears of blood, causing him to gasp like a girl.*

Lance: *He looked into the room with a brave face and took a step inside, raising the lightning sword.* "..."

Tyler: "W-What are you doing?"

Lance: "I gotta check 'n' see if anyone is in here."

Tyler: *He took a deep breath, hesitantly nodding his head.* "Y-Yeah."

Lance: "Mister awesome and quick fingers walked into the facility and hastily observed the room."

Tyler: *He noticed damage Rosterology consoles and more blood smears.* "They were definitely in here."

Lance: "Obviously."

Tyler: "U-Umm, Lance?"

Lance: "Yea?" *He continued to inspect behind the Rosterology consoles, searching for any survivors.*

Tyler: "What does it feel like to Hi-Ougi?"

Lance: "Aye? Why do you wanna know?"

Tyler: "For research.."

Lance: "Ah, OK.." *He glanced at Tyler, walking around another Rosterology console.* "Well, you get a surge of their power, and you feel yours goin' into them too."

Tyler: "Yeah, I already know this from reading about it. It's just the mixture of your Neurons flowing-"

Lance: "Yea, well, I don't read."

Tyler: "S-Sorry, go on."

Lance: "Well.. It's hard to explain, but, when you're close with someone, it feels like a door unlocks."

Tyler: "I don't understand?"

Lance: "Aha, thought you were goin' to give me a nerdy explanation of wat that was too."

Tyler: "Lance?"

Lance: "With that locked door feelin', once it felt like it was open, that's when the Newgongs swapped and mixed."

Tyler: (The door unlocking might have something to do with Astragons?)

Lance: "And, yea?" *He shrugged his shoulders as if he didn't know what else to say.*

Tyler: (That's what a Hi-Ougi feels like? I may not have Neurons or Astragons to the point of using them in battle, but with Season..) *He nervously held onto his RPG bag and ran his fingers along the strap, temporarily forgetting the blood around him.*

Lance: "I haven't checked here-" *He mumbled to himself and pointed the lightning in front, causing the darkened area to light up.* "Nothin'."

Tyler: (Maybe I could give it a try..? He's kept me under his wing.. It feels like he's family now.)

Lance: *He sighed and stopped searching, looking at Tyler.* "Well, there ain't any bodies here-"

*A screech echoed from the hallway, causing them to look over their shoulders in shock.*

Tyler: "H-Huh?"

Lance: "It came from upstairs, aye!"

Tyler: "Y-Yes-"

Lance: *He grunted and ran out of the facility, running down the hallway.* (These little shits are annoyin'!)

Tyler: "W-Wait for me!-" *He ran out of the facility, watching Lance run up the stairs.* (Those creatures got through the castle fast-)

*Another screech echoed, causing Tyler to run faster down the hallway.*

Lance: *He stood in a confronted manner and frowned, staring at five Darkwings stare back at him.* "I'm not scared of you stupid things."

*Lance grunted with confidence and raised the lightning to his face, causing the Darkwings to lean back.*

Tyler: *He jumped from the staircase and instantly noticed the Darkwings, causing him to tumble back behind Lance.* "G-Get them."

Lance: "I can't."

Tyler: "Why?"

Lance: "Look behind 'em."

Tyler: *He looked behind the Darkwings and noticed several unconscious researchers lying on the floor.* (There are some researchers!)

*The Darkwings stepped forward, causing Tyler to notice a large pool of blood.*

Lance: "One thing about my lightning, I can't control the static. I may not know much about maths, but I know electricity is absorbed through liquids."

Tyler: "Th-That's science and it's not exactly absorbed-"

Lance: "Wateva!"

Darkwing: "Skree." *It croaked as its shadow swirled around it.*

Lance: "I could use an Air Slash or Thunder Bo-"

Tyler: "Ougi!" *He grunted in desperation, throwing both hands into the RPG bag.*

Lance: "H-Huh?" *He glanced over his shoulder at Tyler, before focusing back in front.* "Wat are you doin'?"

Tyler: "My crafting abilities improve with each release!"

Lance: (Owgee? Release?) "You don't have Newrongs or Astragongs-"

Tyler: "Mastered state of Alchemy and Crafting I show you, Ragnarok."

Lance: (Rag-narok?) *He looked back to Tyler, shaking his head as if he was an idiot.*

Darkwing: "Skree." *It jumped onto the wall and lunged towards Lance, catching his attention.*

Lance: "Shit!-"

Tyler: "I can do this-" *He threw both hands into the air and a puddle of white liquid splashed above him, catching Lance's attention.* "I-I really can!"

*The water swirled around Tyler's wrists and hands and solidified, taking shape of two handguns.*

Lance: "P-Pistols?!"

Darkwing: *It jumped into striking distance and raised its arm, jabbing towards Lance's face.* "Skrah!"

Lance: *He grunted with widening eyes and formed a fist, pulling his arm back.* "THUNDER-"

Tyler: *He aimed one of the handguns and shot a fluoro green bullet through the Darkwing.* "..."

Lance: *He gasped, watching a small stream of dust spiral past him.* "Holy f-?"

Darkwing: *It watched its fellow Darkwing fall back and slide along the floor.* "Skree!"

Tyler: *He sidestepped towards Lance with his arms straightened, aiming the handguns on two Darkwings.* "Sorry-"

*Tyler pulled the triggers and two small fluoro bullets shot past Lance, hitting two of the Darkwings.*

Lance: *He noticed bullet holes in the Darkwings' skulls, watching them suddenly puff into dust.* "W-When could you-?"

Tyler: *He pulled the triggers and nothing happened.* (Only three shots before it needs to recharge?)

Lance: (Looks like he's got no bullets left or somethin'-)

*The two remaining Darkwings sprinted towards Tyler, causing their nails to scratch into the polished floors.*

Lance: *He stepped in front of Tyler and spread his arms, as the lightning's swirl slowed and dissipated.* "Roar with the skies might-"

*The Darkwings jumped on both sides of the wall and sprinted towards Lance.*

Tyler: *He looked to each side of the wall in shock.* (They're running on the walls! They're so scary looking!-)

*The Darkwings ran into striking distance, causing them to bend at the knees.*

Lance: *He watched the Darkwings lunge themselves off the wall, causing him to cross his arms.* "THUNDER BOOM"

Tyler: *He gasped with fear and looked away, tightly closing his eyes.* (I can't watch!-)

Lance: *As the Darkwings lunged into striking distance, he pushed both arms to the side.* "Humph-"

*Loud thunder caused Tyler to jump and open his eyes, causing him to notice each Darkwing smashing against both sides of the wall.*

Lance: *He looked over his shoulder at Tyler, then in front to the researchers.* "Check 'n' see if they're OK."

Tyler: "Yes." *The handguns disintegrated into nothing and he ran over to the researchers.*

Lance: "I'll quickly go get Alicia-"

Tyler: "Here-" *He reached into the RPG bag and quickly threw his hand in the air.*

Lance: "Here, wat-?"

*A green gas spiralled around the researchers and disintegrated.*

Lance: "What is that?"

Tyler: "They're Acro Berries." *He looked over his shoulder.* "They've got amazing healing properties."

Lance: "Berries? Looks like a gas to me."

Tyler: "I crafted their formula and recreated them as a gas-"

Lance: "Rightio." *He spoke as if he didn't care and walked up to Tyler, glancing down.* "How are they?"

Tyler: "I'm not a healer, but they seem to be breathing." *He shrugged his shoulders in confusion.*

Lance: "Ya think that's all of 'em?"

Tyler: "I-I hope so."

Lance: *He looked around, observing the area.* "Mister amazing noticed a massive circular room with wooden polished pillars which stood next to the walls."

Tyler: *He sighed at Lance and touched a researcher's neck, feeling her pulse.* "Really, Lance?"

Lance: "Do your thing, I'll do mine-" *He grunted at Tyler, continuing to inspect the area.* (I haven't been on this floor before-)

Tyler: *He looked up and whispered numbers, nodding his head in relief.* (Pulse is fine-)

Lance: "The polished floors shined in the light, several cases filled with books stacked against the wall in between the wooden pillars... The pillars were carved with fancy royal-like patterns and a massive door similar to the pillars' design was firmly built."

Tyler: *He ignored Lance, looking at the wooden door.* "That's the royal chambers-"

*The wooden door burst open and a man in robes jumped out, causing Tyler to squeal in shock.*

Lance: "Wha-?"
Tyler: "W-Who-?!" *He gasped with a dropping jaw, intensely staring at the man who was hidden behind his robes.*

?????: *He landed on one foot and quickly ran past Tyler and Lance with ease, suddenly disappearing with a fading image down the stairs.*

Tyler: "Who was-?"

Rachael: *She ran out of the royal chambers, frowning in desperation.* "We won't let you escape!"

----------

*A ring of Darkwings trapped several warriors and Scoldrant-like men in a small group.*

Season: "GLACIA'S EDGE" *He swayed his hand and a blast of ice shot up, smashing three Darkwings into dust.*

Joy: *She nervously looked at a cluster of Darkwings, watching them slowly crawl towards her and Chrisma.* (This is bad-)

*Joy had a flashback of a swarm of Darkwings diving into the large party, effectively separating them.*

Joy: (I wonder if they purposely separated us-?)

Darkwing: "Skree."

Chrisma: "J-Joy, I'm too weak. I used my Ougi and.." *She sighed in exhaustion, shaking her head as if she couldn't fight any more.*

Cameron: *Blood ran from several cuts on his arms.* (They are incredibly weak, but their numbers are too vast-)

Apollo: "BRISTLING SHOCKWAVE" *He flapped downwards, causing a swirl of brown leaves to slice into the Darkwings around Cameron.*

Cameron: *He noticed the brown leaves and watched all the Darkwings puff into dust, causing him to look up.* (Much appreciated.)

Apollo: "Sqwuark!" *He flapped his wings and flew in a large circle, observing the battle scene from a bird's eye view.*

Alicia: *She held PKMY up in her arms and looked into the distance, raising her hand.* (PKMY's weak from destroying that massive creature-)

*Alicia discreetly looked at PKMY and frowned, causing ice spears to form themselves in the air.*

Alicia: "ICICLE EDGE" *The ice spears suddenly shot down and struck several Darkwings, bursting them into dust.*

PKMY: (I'm not sure if we can do this. I have to try and be brave for PKMY-) *Alicia's words echoed in her mind, causing her to gasp.* "Did you say something?"

Alicia: *She seemed too distracted on the nearby Darkwings.* "Holland, behind you!"

Holland: "Thanks." *He jumped to the side and Freya pounced forward, biting into the Darkwing's arm.*

PKMY: *She glanced at the chief who was fighting alongside three warriors.* (I don't like the warriors, but I have to put my morals aside and help defeat these creatures.) *The chief's thoughts echoed in her mind, causing her eyes to widen.*

Darkwing: "Skree!" *It screeched behind Alicia, causing her to gasp in shock.*

Alicia: *She looked over her shoulders and glanced at the Darkwing with widening eyes.* "C-Serenity Stroke." *She swayed her arm to the side, causing a stroke of light to slice through the Darkwing's neck.*

Darkwing: "Skre-" *It awkwardly leant to the side and collapsed onto the ground, puffing into dust.*

PKMY: *She frowned in thought, placing a hand on her head.* (These voices I'm hearing.. Maybe the fatigue has got to me-?)

*Cloud-like shadows moved along the ground, causing the party to look up to the sky in confusion.*

Whitehead: *He squinted his eyes, shaking his head in confusion.* "I don't know, more of those creatures?"

Holland: *He looked up with magnified vision and gasped.* "They're arrows!"

Cameron: "What?!"

*Skeletal arrows rained down and stabbed several warriors on the shoulders.*

Warrior: "Ergh!" *He grunted in pain, dropping his battle axe.*

Darkwing: *It screeched and stepped forward, readying to pounce at a dog-like man.* "Skree-" *The arrows jabbed into its body, causing it to puff into dust.*

Holland: *Several arrow-like bones pierced into his back.* "Argh-"

PKMY: *She gagged and held the sides of her head in pain.* (Their pain, I feel it all!)

Alicia: "PKMY-" *Bone shards rained around her, causing her to shuffle back.*

PKMY: "Their pain-" *An arrow-like bone jabbed into her leg, causing her to silently grit her teeth.*

Alicia: "PKMY!?"

PKMY: *She looked up to Alicia with a weakened face.* "I feel it.."

Alicia: "F-Feel what?"

PKMY: "I feel your warmth for me... We need to attack them all with something that doesn't possess a destructive Rasticsplash."

Alicia: "B-But what?"

PKMY: "Do you feel it?" *She stood up despite her wounds and looked at Alicia face to face.*

Alicia: *She inhaled deeply and nodded her head.* "Yes, I feel it."

PKMY: *She half smirked and leant forward, holding the side of Alicia's head.* "Then, let's do it-"

Alicia: "O-Okay-" *She spoke under her breath, looking at PKMY with slow breathing.*

PKMY: "...-" *She closed her eyes, gently kissing Alicia on the lips.*

Alicia and PKMY: "Hi-Ougi."

Holland: "Harh?" *He noticed PKMY and Alicia kissing, causing him to ignore the spears of bones which pierced into his back.*

Freya: "Neh?" *She tilted her head at an angle.*

Holland: "..." *He slightly smiled in a dumb-like manner, ignoring a wave of skeletal arrows which slashed past his face.*

Season: (Amy?)

*Several of the nearby men stared at Alicia and PKMY with confused smiles.*

Alicia and PKMY: *They stepped back and opened their eyes, intensely staring at each other.* "Icy swirls erupt down around us-"

*Alicia and PKMY raised their arms and a pool of white glittering liquid spread in the air above them.*

Cameron: (A Hi-Ougi-)

Alicia and PKMY: "Frigid skies fall and plummet to our command-" *Sounds of forming ice echoed from the pool of liquid, catching Apollo's attention.*

Apollo: (That power... The Neuron build-up is massive!)

Cameron: (But there is also something else? I do not believe it is just Astragons.)

Joy: *She gasped in realisation, quickly looking at Alicia and PKMY.* (That feeling, Radiatons?!)

Alicia and PKMY: "HOLY ICICLE SABER'S EDGE"

*Alicia and PKMY yelled and violently dropped their arms, causing a barrage of fluoro blue ice spears to shoot down around them.*

Darkwing: "Skre-" *Forty to fifty ice spears shot into its bone, causing small bursts of dust to swirl around it.*

Chief: (Fast-)

Darkwing: "Skrreee!" *It screeched in agonising pain before bursting into frozen shards of dust.*

Warrior: *He coughed up blood and looked at Alicia and PKMY, watching the ice spears slowly shatter on the ground towards him.* "H-Hah-?!"

Season: *He looked at the waves of ice spears in shock, quickly pointing to his side at a lunging Darkwing.* "FIRE'S PULSE" *He pushed forward without looking and blasted the Darkwing into dust with a pulse of fire.*

Warrior: *He awkwardly crawled back as he felt slight rumbles on the ground, due to the ice.* (I've hurt my leg, I can't avoid-) *Several spears shot into his leg, causing him to yell.*

Season: (What?! They attacked our comrades!) "Don't use something so advanced, if you've yet to master it!-"

Holland: "Amy, Alicia, what are you-?!" *A burst of ice spears shot into his body, causing him to gasp in shock.*

PKMY: (Your power-)

Alicia: (Our power.) *She stared at PKMY in a loving manner, causing more ice spears to rain down around them.*

PKMY: *She looked up and watched the white glittering pool of liquid dance.* (You shouldn't run off like that again.)

Alicia: *PKMY had a flashback of her teleporting which flashed in her mind.* (I had to do it alone-)

PKMY: (And that's fine.)

Alicia: (What?)

PKMY: (Just don't keep your friends in the dark, it's fine to do things on your own. But, don't walk away from the people who care about you like that again-)

*PKMY looked down with swaying her as if there was no gravity.*

PKMY: (OK?) *She slowly inhaled and looked at Alicia in the eyes, slowly leaning forward for another kiss.*

Alicia: (PKMY-) *She cupped her pendant in a feminine manner, closing her eyes.*

*Clusters of snow pulsed around PKMY and Alicia, blocking visibility of the nearby party members.*

Alicia: (I won't-) *A flash of ice and snow blasted into a pulse around her.* (-Ever do it again.)

*The area slowly became blinding white, cueing a howl-like sound in the wind.*

Season: *He raised his arms ignoring his flapping robes.* (This wind is strong-)

*Season squinted his eyes and scanned the area, staring at the blizzard-like terrain.*

Season: (I can't see a thing!)

Chrisma: (Everything is white!-) "Joy, are you there?"

Joy: *She looked around and straightened her arms, moving them in a blind-like manner.* "I-I'm here-"

*Alicia and PKMY stepped away from each other, causing swirls of bright white snow to fade into the air.*

PKMY: *She smiled with squinting eyes and noticed the wind die down, causing the area to revert back to normal.* "That felt good, eh?"

Alicia: "Tee hee, yep."

Season: *He blinked and shivered, observing the area in shock.* "The Darkwings-"

Joy: "Only the Darkwings." *She spoke under her breath, glancing at Season with widening eyes.*

Season: "Are frozen..."

Chrisma: "Oh, get in!"

Holland: "Huh?" *He reached behind his back and noticed the bones were no longer there.* "They're gone? And I'm healed?"

Warrior: "M-My leg?!" *He stood up and tapped it on the ground, causing his armour to rattle.* "It's all better." *He grunted with amazement, catching the nearby warriors' attention.*

Cameron: "My wounds have also been healed."

Freya: (Mine too, Holland!) *She wagged her tail and accidentally shattered a nearby frozen Darkwing.*

Whitehead: *He leant back and a Darkwing's arms shattered off his leg.* "What in the ocean's name has happened, argh?!" *He grunted and swayed his cutlass swords in confusion.*

Season: "From my understanding, they're powers combined. PKMY's destructive force and Alicia's healing abilities-"

*PKMY and Alicia collapsed to the ground, catching the party's attention.*

Holland: *He ran up to PKMY and Alicia, quickly leaning down to aid them.* "They're okay."

*Holland placed his hand on PKMY's cheek and the purple ring spiralled around his iris, observing the area around her body from a heightened and altered perspective.*

Holland: "They've only passed out!"

Season: "Oh, thank goodness."

Chrisma: "Oh, bless them." *She twiddled her fingers feeling revitalised.*

*A black wave of shadow spewed out from the entrance of the city and rumbled towards the party.*

Whitehead: "What the water's lord is that?!" *He grunted in a pirate-like manner, pointing a cutlass sword at the shadow.*

Season: "The Consultant?" *He mumbled to himself, closely observing the massive shadow.*

Joy: "Could someone with eyes please tell us?"

Chief: *He looked at Joy and nodded his head, twitching his whiskers in concentration.* "It's.."

Cameron, Chief and Holland: "A swarm of Darkwings!" *Their words caused Chrisma, Joy, Season, warriors and several Scoldrant-like people to gasp.*

Season: (Although Alicia and PKMY's Hi-Ougi revitalised me-) *He stared at the Darkwings with doubt.* (The sheer numbers this time, is far too many for us to handle-)

*Several blasts of wind-based arrows shot from behind the party and into several Darkwings in the far distance.*

Joy: "What-?" *She gasped in shock, watching the Darkwings puff into dust.*

*Several fluoro green bullets shot past the party and into several Darkwings.*

Cat-tailed Woman: *She watched five Darkwings explode into dust.* "What?"

*Blasts of stones rained past the party and into the Darkwings, causing them to instantly puff into dust.*

Holland: "What was that green thing-?"

*Nathan and Blake flashstepped in front of the party, blowing rings of dust around their feet.*

Blake: "Fufufufu.. Time to kick some butt, rite?"

*Rachael, Ginger and Luna moved at incredible speeds next to Nathan and Blake, unintentionally forming a line in front of the party.*

Whitehead: *He stared at the guild's backs, pointing his cutlass sword at them in shock.* "Them.."

Chrisma: "W-Who are they? Have we met them before?"

Luna: "Who are they?" *She grunted, looking behind her to Chrisma.* "The hell's this bitch?"

*Lance, Tyler, Lezard and Karol ran from the castle towards the guild and party.*

Lezard: "The ruler of Surpreon, Whitehead's crew, The Seaside Bandits, Hollando Breeze, Joy and Chrisma!"

Season: *He watched Tyler run past him.* "Tyler?" *He sounded surprised.*

Tyler: *He unintentionally ignored Season and noticed several Darkwings flying in the air, causing him to point the handguns in the air.* "Leave this city!-"

*Several fluoro green bullets shot from the handguns and towards the Darkwings.*

Season: *He stared at the handguns, watching a trail of green smoke evaporate from them.* (What are they-?)

Luna: "Lunar Gale." *She shouted and shot several arrows made of wind into the sky, bursting three Darkwings into a scattering blast of dust.*

*The echoing screeches above caused Season to look up, allowing him to notice the falling of dust.*

Season: (What the Astragons did I just witness-?)

Lezard: "Ooo, hot gravy! You know we can't flashstep!" *He giggled in a sarcastic manner and hobbled up to the guild, lining himself up with them.*

Karol: "Y-Yheah!" *He waddled up to the party and lined up with them.*

Chief: "Who are you?!" *He looked over his shoulder, unintentionally growling at the guild.*

Karol, Rachael, Luna, Nathan, Blake, Lezard: "We're-"
Ginger: "..."

Rachael, Nathan and Blake: "The Rostical Guild!"
Ginger, Karol, Lezard: "The Remenistal Guild!"
Luna: "The Rostickal Guild!"

Ginger: "Ykkt-" *She sighed under her breath as if she was embarrassed.*

Karol: "Nee hee! Yooh said it, Gingarh!"

Ginger: "It was foolish!-"

Karol: It was amayzing!"

Ginger: "Yoh?" *She whispered to herself in confusion as she listened to the screeches in the background with blushing cheeks.*

Karol: "H-Hey, we said it wright this time!"

Ginger: "Ey, K-Karol, indeed we did."

Luna: "Aha." *She grunted with a smirk.*

Chief: *He noticed Blake, causing his whiskers to shake, emphasising a huge growing smile on his face.* "Blake!"

Blake: *He looked behind him, hissing with a shocked smirk.* "You! Wazzup?"

Lezard: *He cupped his hands and wiggled his bottom to each side.* "It was delicious, bwarharh-"

Nathan: *He frowned and pointed his sword in front.* "Focus on the enemies in front!"

Karol: *He enthusiastically inhaled, nodding his head with a frown.* "Right! Because I'ma man!"

Ginger: "Ey, Nate? I concur your statement! Please respond!"

Blake: "So, what should we do, bitches?" *He glanced at the guild with reptilian-like eyes.*

Ginger: "Logically, splitting the guild to the front and using powerful techniques outside the city, please respond."

Nathan: *He nodded his head in understanding.* "And the others fight inside-"
Luna: "Aye? Why split up?"

Lezard: "And why outside? Aren't we protecting the city?"

Ginger: "If we allocate members of my retinue outside the city, this will lift the handicap on their abilities and allow them to strike without fret of damaging the city."

Destiny: *She floated down towards Luna.* "..."

Luna: "And-" *She glanced to each side, quickly observing the Darkwing infested city.* "What about the demon, aye?"

Destiny: "Yeup." *She purred in a concerned manner, sitting on top of Luna's shoulder.*

Rachael: "The demon?" *She spoke with an emotionless face, gritting her teeth.*

Ginger: "I sense he-" *She paused, looking at Rachael.* "It is now out of the city-"

Rachael: *She frowned with regret and tightened her fists, causing the leather gloves to make stretching sounds.* "We have to protect the city first, for Grey and Ordin."

Ginger: "Yeoshh." *She nodded her head in agreement.*

Nathan: (Going outside and stopping the Darkwings from entering the city is rather smart. If Ginger didn't bring it to my attention, I personally would've just kept attacking them in here-)

Lezard: "Ooo!-" *He noticed the swarm of Darkwings continue to run towards the guild.* "If you're going outside, how will you get through?"

Season: "AQUATIC DIVIDER" *He stared at the backs of the guild members and stamped his foot, causing two waves to erupt on either side of them.*

Karol: "H-Huh-?" *He watched the water rumble in front of him and separate, pushing the Darkwings out of the way.* (Wow-)

Rachael: *She watched the current in the water move, listening to the screeching Darkwings.* (He formed a path for us-)

Luna: "Rach?"

Rachael: "Alright, split ourselves up, go!"

Lance: *He stood next to Season and stared at the guild, puffing his lips in determination.* "I'm goin'!"

Season: "..."

Lance: *He ran down in between the walls of water, ignoring the strings of water which splashed around his feet.* (This whole, not using strong Rostickal ain't my thing.)

Luna: *She swayed her long white hair and ran after Lance, causing Destiny to fly after her.* "I'm comin' too."

Season: "I would like to eliminate these creatures too!" *He swayed his arms, causing the walls of water to stabilise and he hobbled down the path.*

Nathan: "Count me in." *He reached behind his back and pulled forward, unsheathing a swirl of sparks.*

Chrisma: "What-?" *She looked at the sword in Nathan's hand, watching him flashstep down the path.*

Nathan: *The area blurred past him as he admired The Sword of Memories in his hand.* "Hmph-"
Chrisma: (Wow, what an amazing sword!)

Rachael: *She turned around and observed the area.* (Just Luna and Nathan are heading outside?)

Karol: "I whant to fight by Gingarh and Waichael's side!" *He squealed with a determined frown.*

Blake: "I'm staying here and fighting for the only guild and city that took me in." *He spoke with a hiss.*

Lezard: "Lezard will be here for jokes and giggles!"

Ginger: "I will focus on the numbers inside this city, then focus my attention outside to assist with the other guild members." *She spiralled shurikens in her hands.*

Rachael: *She watched the water crash in front of her, cueing her to take several steps backwards.* "Alright, everyone attack the ene-" *She paused in mid-sentence, noticing warriors attacking the Darkwings.*

Karol: "Waichael?"

Blake: *He placed one of his hands on his waist, looking at them in confusion.* "I'm just as confused as you are, but it looks like they're on our side, hey."

Rachael: "Did they take in what you said back in Sorrowprax?"

Blake: "Me?" *He hissed under his breath.* "I don't fink so, hey."

Lezard: "Razzypoo?"

Rachael: *She nodded her head.* "Umm, only attack the bone creatures!"

Karol: "G-Got it!"

Ginger: *She flicked her long black hair over her shoulder, elegantly reaching to her sides.* "This will be easy-"

Joy: "Here they come!" *She shouted with worry, drawing the guild's attention above.*

Ginger: *She leapt forward, stepping on the fading water caused by Season's Rostical.* "Yo!-" *She twirled once and threw the shurikens, watching them both spiral through the nearby Darkwings, violently bursting them into scattering clouds of dust.*

----------

*Lance, Luna, Season and Nathan ran outside the city across the aura-made bridge.*

Destiny: (Luna, ahead!-)

Luna: *Her vision magnified, allowing her to see Darkwings jumping onto the aura bridge.* "Shit, they're comin' right for us, aye."

Season: *He ran with a slight hobble in his step.* "There won't be enough room for us to fight properly! I'm not as adept at balance than you, I might get knocked off!"

Lance: "Pssht, yea right." (I won't let that happen, Season.) *He clicked his fingers and blue lightning sparked around his fingers, catching Luna's attention.*

Luna: (Aye?)

Lance: (You pieces of shit have caused us too much grief already!-) *He raised his arm and lightning swirled, forming a sword in his hand.*

Destiny: (It's just like your bow, Luna!-)

Luna: (Pssht, as if!) *She flicked her fingernail, cueing her to suddenly smirk with a confident grunt.*

Darkwing: "Schree."

Season: *He looked at the lightning sword with a disapproving shake of his head.* "L-Lance, use Rostical, if you swing too far you might lose balance and fall off-"

Lance: "Nah, I'm fine-"

*Arrows made of wind shot past Season and Lance and exploded the Darkwings off the path.*

Lance: "W-Wha-?" *He looked over his shoulder and noticed Luna running behind him.*

Destiny: (Direct hit!)

Luna: (Aha, thanks to you too, kitty!)

Destiny: *She noticed Lance's shocked expression on his face.* (What's wrong with him-?)

Lance: "Y-Your hair?!"

Luna: *She looked surprised and then annoyed.* "Wat 'bout it?!"

Lance: "It's white!"

Luna: "Nah, it's black."

Lance: "Wateva."

Luna: *She rolled her eyes, frowning at Lance.* "Did you forget? Or you never paid attention."

Lance: "My bad."

Destiny: (He sounds like someone I-)

Luna: (Finish that and I'll shove ya face in your litter-box!)

Nathan: *He ran in front of Luna, staring at Lance's back.* (Gabriel, he's the one we're chasing after-)

Luna: *She grunted in an annoyed manner, continuing to run down the aura path.* "The faster we do this-"

Nathan: "The faster we can pursue that man."

Luna: "Yes."

Destiny: "Yeup." *She meowed in agreement, hovering after the guild.*

Nathan: *He smiled.* (Is she thinking the same thing?)

Season: *He looked past the party and noticed clusters of Darkwings waiting for them on the land.* (There's another swarm outside?! If Teresa was here, she would've suggested going outside sooner-)

Lance: *He jumped off the path and stepped on the ground, straightening his arm at several Darkwings.* "LIGHTNING BLAST"

Season: (I feel stupid for not thinking of it earlier! That Ginger woman is definitely smart considering how late they entered the fray-)

Lance: "Hah!" *His sword suddenly extended into a stream of lightning, before unnaturally curving towards the Darkwings.*

Luna: "Aye?"
Destiny: "Yeup?"

Season: (He's mastered the Rostical to the level where he can freely manipulate the lightning in that manner?!)

Luna: (Gimme a bird's eye view, Dest!)

Destiny: "Yeup!" *She flew high into the air, causing Luna to slightly sway with disorientation.*

Nathan: (Ordin's words, I heard them loud and clear!-) *He flashstepped away from the party and appeared out of attacking range, raising the sword to his head.* "You cannot stop me-"

Luna: *She noticed Nathan in Destiny's field of vision, causing her to smirk.* "..."

Darkwing: "Skree!" *It screeched at Nathan and crawled around him, moving in a predacious manner.*

Nathan: "I've acquired the strongest sword skill there is." *He spoke to the Darkwings not caring if they could understand his words.*

Lance: *The lightning sparked through all the Darkwings, causing their bodies to fade into dust.* "Aha-" *He glanced at Luna with a childish smirk.*

Luna: "Wat?"

Lance: "Yea, you see that?!" *He noticed her eyes, causing him to pause.*

Destiny: (He's dumb?)

Luna: "Yup-?"

Lance: *He looked around Luna's shoulders as if he was trying to find something.* "Where's that Scoldrant thing-?"

Luna: "Scoldrant thing?"

Lance: "Yea? Pewyoop." *He tried to meow like Destiny, but ended up saying something that sounded like poop.*

Destiny: (Poop-?)

Luna: "Destiny." *She slightly tilted her head forward, emphasising how wrong Lance was.*

Lance: "Wateva."

Destiny: "Yeup." *She hovered in a safe distance, closely watching Luna on the battlefield.*

Lance: "So.." *He looked awkward and raised his arm, purposely showing off swirls of lightning.*

Luna: "I saw it just fine, thanks-" *She hissed and raised her arm, crossing it over her shoulder.*

Lance: "Snappy tom-" *He mumbled under his breath, frowning like a child.*

Destiny: (Your memories.. Did he call you cat food?)

Luna: (I dunno wat goes through his effin' head, aye!-) "Spiralling lightning, instantaneously pierce-" *Her voice echoed, catching Lance's attention.*

Lance: (That sounded like Rostickal-?)

Luna: "CRESCENT VOLT HOOK"

Lance: "H-Huh?" *He watched a powerful blast of purple lightning instantly strike several Darkwings.* "You can-?"

Destiny: (The look on his face!) *She purposely magnified her vision on Lance's facial expression.*

Luna: "Aha-" *She raised her left hand and clicked her fingers, causing lightning to swirl and form itself into a bow.*

Lance: "That's like my!-"

Luna: "Harh!" *She pulled the string back and shot an arrow of lightning towards a Darkwing which lunged itself above Lance.*

Lance: "Wha-ow-awh?!" *He quickly ducked in shock, as a pulse of dust landed on his head, causing him to cough.*

Luna: *She sniffed her nose with a smirk, grinning at Lance.* "That face-"

Lance: "Sh-Shut up."

Luna: "That's wat I thought, aye."

Lance: "Stop stealin' my speech, it's the most unique thing 'bout me, aye."

Luna: "Pssht." *She sighed under her breath and looked away from Lance, discreetly watching Nathan fight.*

Nathan: *He sliced behind him, before lowering the sword in front of him.* "My strongest skill-"

Darkwing: "Sk-?" *It stared at Nathan's back and suddenly burst into dust.*
Nathan: "-And this sword, nothing can stand in my way."

Darkwing: "Skree-" *It stumbled back and glanced at Nathan's sword as rainbow coloured sparks shattered its bones, causing it to puff into dust.*

Nathan: (Ordin, your memories-)

Luna: *She sighed in amazement.* (He just owned two of the Darkdickers in one movement of his sword.)

Destiny: (Luna, let's focus!)

Luna: (Focus, focus, focus.. There's a reason why I hated school, aye.) *She rolled her eyes and pulled the string to her bow back.* (Lemme just perve a little while longer.)

Nathan: "Dragon's Gate." *He jabbed the sword towards the ground, causing an eruption of fluoro red, dragon-like heads to wave from the sword's tip.*

Lance: *He noticed a swirl of dirt blow around Nathan, drawing his attention to the aura-like dragon heads.* (Holy shit-)

Destiny: (Nathan-?!)

Luna: *She smiled and released the string, shooting an arrow of lightning directly into a Darkwing's skull, bursting it back into a scattering dust cloud.*

Season: (Dragon's Gate..) *He watched a wave of red dragon heads erupt on top of the Darkwings, feeling the ground rumble under his feet.* (If I recall correctly, that was the move Cassandra used on me and Teresa back in Sorrowprax-)

Nathan: *He smirked, listening to the sounds of screeches and cracking bones.* "Sword skills at its finest."

Luna: "You can relax now, you ain't the only one with kool lightning abilities, aye-"

Lance: *He took two glances at Luna.* "Yea?! Well, look at this!"

Destiny: (Why is he determined to show off his skills?)

Luna: (Good question-)

Lance:*He turned around and faced another group of Darkwings, watching fog expel from his fingertips.* "Owgee!"

Luna: *She looked surprised.* (My big goofy brother has an Owgee!?)

Lance: "Cloud-nine Volt." *He inhaled and motioned both arms in front, causing a gust of fog to spiral in front of him.*

Luna: (Mist?)

Destiny: (Not even you have an Ougi!-)

Lance: *He pushed forward and a barrage of bolts flared out of the fog.* "Harh!" *He heard the sounds of bones cracking, as the lightning flared into the close-ranged Darkwings.*

Destiny: (Amazing-)
Luna: "Borin'!"

Lance: (Borin'?) "OK!? Zero-volt Blender." *He swayed his arms and took control of the fog.* "Take this, you Luna lookalikes!"

Luna: "Luna, wat a wats!?"

Lance: "Harh!" *He motioned his hands towards four Darkwings, manipulating the fog's movement with his arms.*

Destiny: (He can control fog?)

Luna: (Pssht, we can control wind! Unless he wants to cause traffic jams or delayed flights, we got this-)

Destiny: "Yeu?"

Luna: *She watched the Darkwings jump out of the fog's path, causing her to chuckle in a condescending manner.* "Aha, lame-"

*The fog clipped several Darkwings, causing lightning to static up their arms and legs.*

Luna: "Huh-?" *The lightning intensified, causing their bodies to burst into dust.*

Darkwing: "Skrah!-" *Its screech echoed, as its body puffed into dust.*

Destiny: (That's very similar to the new Azure Bursts you've recently learnt!)

Nathan: *He swayed the sword to his side, causing a stream of red-like mist to fade away from the tip of the blade.* (That attack?) *He stood up straight, focusing his attention in Lance's general direction.* (The fog is charged with static?)

Season: (Amazing, Lance..) *He watched the Darkwings violently burst into dust once touched by Lance's fog.*

Nathan: (I was out of it.. So that's what he was doing to Brazza.)

Lance: *He looked around and noticed piles of dust, causing him to lower his arms.* "Yea, I just cleared the entire area around me!" *He jumped around and faced Luna with a childish frown.*

Luna: (He really did just clear them all!-) *She watched the fog clear, causing her to frown, pretending to not be impressed.* "Pssht.."

Season: "Good work, Lance, but it isn't over-" *He turned around and stared at the Darkwings, watching them run directly towards him.*

Darkwing: "Skree!"

Luna: "Oh, scree yaself!"

Season: *He looked serious and started to shift his focus to his surroundings.* "This Rostical, I created it myself-"

Nathan: (Rostical...) *He unintentionally frowned, focusing his attention on Season.* (No! I need to get that type of thinking out of my head.)

Season: (Focus the Neurons.) *A purple glyph drew itself on the ground around him.*

Holland: *He ran with Freya out of the city and down the aura bridge, noticing the party fighting the Darkwings.* (We're a little late.)

Freya: "Gruff!"

Season: *He pretended to hold a ball and tightened his hands in front of him.* "My Rostical explodes deep in the hot abyss-"

*Season raised his arms and rings of purple light formed around him, catching the party's attention.*

Season: "With the seraphic blood I wish to end this battle!-" *The rings imploded into his palm and formed a purple fluoro ball.*

Lance: *He intensely stared at the purple ball in between Season's hands.* "Wait, you can create Rostickal?"

Luna: "No." *She grunted as if she wasn't sure of herself.*

Lance: *He looked confused, pointing at Season.* "But, Season just said-"

Season: "DIMENSION CRISIS"

Luna: *She stared at Season, giving him all her interest.* (I haven't heard Ginger or the champion use that before?)

Darkwing: "Skree-" *One massive firework blasted around it, causing twinkles of purple light to explode in the air.*

Luna: "Fireworks." *She gasped to herself.*

Lance: "Pssht, it's just one firework-"

Season: "There-" *He lowered his arms as if he had just finished, causing Lance to stamp his foot in disgust.*

Lance: "All that over a firework? No offence, but that was lame."

Season: "Lance, don't be so superficial, it did its job." *He pointed to the strings of dust, blowing out of sight in the wind.*

Destiny: (Luna!-) *She watched more Darkwings charge towards the party at different angles.*

Luna: (Ya know, we look through the same line of sight, right?)

Destiny: "Yeup!" (It's just a natural reaction.)

Luna: (Somethin' I wanna ask, though. How come you said I don't have an Owgee?)

Destiny: "Yeu?" (You don-) *She paused as if information was being delivered into her mind.* (How-?! When-?!)

Luna: (Ahaha! Who would've thought getting struck by lightning would make me so OP?)

Lance: "Pssht, wateva." *He grunted and clicked his fingers, causing his face to light up as lightning formed into a sword.* "Still lame, Season."

Luna: *She looked at Lance, annoyed.* "I will show you lame!"

Lance: "Aye?"

Destiny: (Luna, your inner memories! I'm not sure if I'm ready-)

Luna: "Owgee."

----------

Darkwing: *It stood taller than a building and looked down to its feet at the party, screeching in a deep tone.* "Sk-k-karghee!"

Rachael: *She stood next to Tyler, Joy, Chrisma and Karol, all looking up to the sky in shock.* (It's massive-)

Karol: *He trembled, standing on a glowing black glyph.* "I-I don't know, Waich?"

Rachael: (Crud! I don't know what to do?) *She gritted her teeth and punched her crystalline gauntlets together, shattering them into daggers.* (This isn't good! I hope the others aren't fighting something like this!)

Whitehead: *He stood next to a cluster of warriors, Scoldrant-like people and several bystanders.* "It's growing even larger!"

Chrisma: "Oh, shit our faces." *She looked up in shock, tugging on her robes in defeat.*

Lezard: "Lezard completely agrees, my delightful yet vulgar lass." *He focused on healing Alicia and PKMY as their bodies lay motionless by his feet.*

Chrisma: "Perhaps we could exchange the name calling for our date?"

Lezard: "Lezard happily complies."

Joy: *She looked annoyed.* "Enough flirting!"

Lezard: "No flirting here! Lezard just needs to heal these two scandalous ladies from their amazing attack. But Lezard thinks they tried to copyright my Hi-Ougi with Loonzamotto."

Blake: "It's so large, you can feel when it moves from the air."

Ginger: "Ey, Blake, at least there are no more entities to focus on."

Blake: "Fufufufu, that's totes my spice. I should keep trying to be, like, positive."

Cameron: "This is what happened before."

Joy: "Except only several creatures merged into two. Not all of them."

Rachael: *She gritted her teeth, shaking her head.* (I don't know.. It feels like I don't have time for this!)

Karol: "W-What shall we dooh?"

Lezard: *A white glow shined off his hands, as he slowly revitalised Alicia and PKMY.* "Why not strike it down before it grows any larger?"

Blake: "Ya think we already tried that?" *He hissed under his breath and rolled his eyes, leaning to one side.*

Ginger: "Our attacks do not affect it when it is doing its merging process."

Apollo: (No signs of weakness from up here.) *He squawked, catching Blake's attention.*

Blake: *He looked up.* (Good to see ya, Apollo!)

Ginger: "Ykkt-" (The two previously larger hostiles needed my full incantation-boosted Remenistal to be taken down, now it has merged into something to the extremity in size.)

Rachael: "Crud.. It's large and normal attacks won't work on it." *She squinted her eyes and a dimple appeared on her cheek, as she stared at the crystal daggers with frustration.*

Karol: "Didn't we encounter that mud monster symilar to this?"

Rachael: (We did, but it's completely different-)

Ginger: "Yes." *She looked at Karol.*

Karol: "Yhes?"
Rachael: "You weren't there?"

Ginger: "Logically speaking, we should use the same actions that caused the destruction of that Scoldrant."

Rachael: (That makes sense!) *She watched the final few Darkwings finish merging into its feet.* (We used a high-powered Rostical-)

Chief: *He purred with frustration and looked at Ginger.* "What was those actions?"

Ginger: "Were."

Chief: "What?"

Ginger: "What were those actions. Please respond?"

Chief: "..."

Blake: *His body reverted back to normal.* "Fufufu, wat did yas do?"

Ginger: "We used a powerful Remenistal of immense magnitude."

Warrior: "Remenistal?"

Tiger-like Woman: "Rostical."

Warrior: "Th-Thanks." *He nervously grunted in appreciation.*

Rachael: "She wasn't there with us, was she?"

Karol: "Nah uh. Nafan told her when we were-" *He pointed down to the ground like a child, attempting to be discreet.*

Rachael: "Oh-?" *She nodded her head in realisation.* (She was asking us for previous battle experiences. She wanted to know so she could plan more teamwork for us.)

Whitehead: (Something strong enough to take down something that big?) "But we can't do that, or we'll damage the city, argh!"

Ginger: "Ykkt." *She looked scared due to Whitehead's worried statement.*

Rachael: (No matter how much I don't want to-) *She frowned in thought, staring at the crystal daggers in her hands.* (If we can't come up with an idea soon, we'll have no choice but to use a powerful technique-)

Giant Darkwing: "Skararhh." *Its shadows dripped on to the ground, spawning small Darkwings.*

Rachael: (What?!)

Ginger: *She noticed the Darkwings, causing her to look at Blake.* "Ey, Blake, there are more!"

Blake: "Got it, bitch!" *He bent his knees and clicked his fingers, causing a materialising glyph to spiral in the air.*

Cameron: "Why? It had just finished merging and now it started to reproduce more?!"

Apollo: (Some species require a certain amount of energy or maturity to allow them to reproduce! Do not think numbers, think of its Neurons.)

Cameron: *He nodded his head, pointing his sword in front.* (I see. It is not losing body mass, but Neurons.)

Apollo: (Correct-) *He squawked as he flew in circles above the giant Darkwing.* (Have I ever stated how much I appreciate having an intelligent partner?)

Ginger: *She ran towards the Darkwings near the giant Darkwing's feet, throwing the shurikens ahead.* "You have no chance-"

Karol: "Allow me to halp, guys!" *He frowned in concentration and started to dance on the glyph, causing it to expand across the ground.*

Blake: *He smirked and raised his arm, watching a blue pearl materialise in his palm.* "Let's go, my sexy, Skuxx!" *He giggled as the pearl disappeared in a pulse of glittering blue sparkles.*

Skuxx: *He flew out of a spiralling glyph, flapping its tiny wings towards Blake.* "Skucks!"

Blake: (I know I've just summoned ya, but do your best, my Skuxx deluxe!) *He bent forward, causing dragon-like wings to erupt out of his back.* "Let's slaughter 'em."

Joy: *She stared at the small blue lizard, cupping her hands in thought.* (Another Scoldrant User-?)

Blake: *He jumped forward and flapped his wings, gliding towards the Darkwings.* "Watch my sexy moves, everyone!"

Chief: *He noticed the wings on Blake, causing him to purr in amazement.* (He finally accepted his hybrid abilities?)

Skuxx: "FLAME BOLT" *He spat out a ball of fire past Ginger, bursting one of the Darkwings into dust.*

Chief: (Such a powerful little summon!-)

Blake: "Hiyah-" *He flapped his wings and spiralled in the air in an acrobatic manner, violently kicking a Darkwing across the skull.*

Darkwing: "Skarh-" *Its skull shattered to the side of Blake's kick, suddenly puffing into dust.*

Blake: "'O yea!" *He giggled and looked to the side, suddenly gargling with a glowing mouth.*

Darkwing: "Skree!" *It pounced towards Blake, raising its claws at his face.*

Blake: "Gargling Flaming Wheel." *He roared like a dragon, breathing out a flame-thrower-like stream at the Darkwing.*

Darkwing: "Skree!" *Its shadows evaporated in the flames, before bursting into dust.*

Tyler: (He sounded like a dragon!-)

Ginger: *She watched her shurikens spiral through two Darkwings, causing them to puff into dust.* (Ordin... Brother.. Father.. My kazoku! My city!-) "I am going to kill you, please respond?"

Darkwing: "Skree!"

Ginger: "Target aimed-" *She elegantly twirled away from the Darkwings and shot bullets of ice out of spiralling blue glyphs around her.*

Darkwing: *It violently rocked to each side, due to being shot by the rapid barrage of ice bullets.* "Skree-"

Ginger: "ICE STREAM DIVIDER" *She stopped spinning and flicked her long black hair over her shoulder, watching five Darkwings puff into dust.*

Skuxx: *He spat out a small fireball behind Ginger, exploding a stealthy Darkwing into dust.* "Skucks!"

Ginger: "Ey, Skuxx? Much appreciated!"

Cameron: *He smiled at Ginger and Blake's chemistry between each other.* (He has made good friends-)

Blake: "Hiyarh!" *He slashed Darkwings with dragon-like claws, watching his hands slice through the bones with ease.*

Karol: "Feel the cold of loneliness, fear overturn happiness, feel its purge!-" *He danced on the glyph, causing several warriors to laugh at him.*

Ginger: *She clicked her fingers, causing the shurikens to spiral back towards her, slashing through another five Darkwings.* "How does it feel to sit on your death bed, please respond?"

*Ginger spoke in a taunt-like manner, catching the shurikens in each hand.*

Chrisma: "Holy shit your face!" *She groaned in amazement, pointing at Ginger like a child.*

Karol: *He raised his arms, crossing them above his head.* "CHAOS FROSTSURGE"

Lezard: "Get 'em, tiger." *He smiled at Karol as light continued to pour out of his hands and into PKMY and Alicia.*

Karol: *He spiralled on the glyph and dropped his arms, causing lines of black ice to slash several Darkwings.* "Hmniyah!"

Warrior A: "What's that? Shadow?"

Warrior B: "No, it's ice!"

*Karol swayed his arms up in a dance-like manner, causing thick eruptions of black ice to crush the surrounding Darkwings.*

Warrior A: "You're right!-"
Warrior B: "Don't hurt me!-"

Karol: "Th-There." *He giggled, ignoring the several warriors gasping in amazement.*

Ginger: *She spiralled her shuriken and slashed off the bandages on her arms, causing them to quickly spiral off her body.* "Time to get serious, please respond."

Blake: *He looked at Ginger with his dragon-like eyes, causing him to glance at Skuxx.* (Retreat my sexy buddy! She attacks so fast, I don't want you getting in the way, hey.)

Skuxx: (I don't mind.. But just remember that it still costs you Neurons to open up our glyph.) *He farted out a gas cloud, before disintegrating into nothing.*

Tyler: *He squinted his eyes, noticing differently coloured tattoo-like glyphs on Ginger's arms.* (What are they-?)

Dawn: "Tyler! Please focus!" *She stood near the castle and panted with a sweaty face, exhausted from fighting the Darkwings.*

Tyler: "G-Got it!" *He watched white liquid swirl around his hands, noticing it take shape of a shotgun.*

Ginger: *She slapped one of the glyphs on her arms and slid it down, causing a massive green glyph to spiral in front of her.* "CYCLONIC WINDS"

*Ginger pushed forward and a screeching gale blasted the surrounding Darkwings off their feet.*

Ginger: *She closed her hands and tightened a fist, causing all the Darkwings to simultaneously burst into dust.* "You are all dead, please respond."

Rachael: (Just how many more Rostical attacks does she know?) *She thought to herself in amazement.*
Tyler: "W-Wow."

Karol: "Waichael! Behind yooh!"

Rachael: *Karol's words alerted her to raise her crystalline daggers, ramming them into an approaching Darkwing.*

Karol: *He watched the Darkwing pulse into dust over her hand.* "Are yooh ohkay?"

Rachael: "I am, thank you! Oh, and, Ty-" *She glanced at Tyler, keeping her focus on the enormous Darkwing.* "Ginger is able to store perfect Rostical incantation-boosted glyphs on her skin."

Tyler: "I-I've never heard of that before."

Rachael: "Neither did I until I met her."

Blake: "There's a few more, want me to get 'em?"

Ginger: "Negative, reveal their locations, please respond?"

Blake: "Behind the big Darkwing's foot, three hidden behind that food booth and five on top of the rooftops."

Ginger: "Ey, Blake? Ougi."

Rachael: (Despite easily eliminating these small Darkwings, I'm worrying about that big one-) *She blew dust off her daggers and focused back to the giant Darkwing.* (How many more times can it spawn? What exactly are these? I want answers!-)

Ginger: *She bent her knees and crossed her arms over her face, as deep lion-like roars echoed around her.* "Elemental Panthers."

----------

Lance: *He twirled around and inspected the area, staring at piles of dust in shock.* (Whoa-) *He stood in amazement, watching the ocean's strong wind blow the dust away.*

Luna: *She slowly floated to the ground and took a deep breath, watching the last lightning bow spark and flash into nothing.* "How was that?"

Lance: "A-Ah-" *He stuttered in disbelief, quickly coughing to cover up his emotions.* "Lame, just like you said."

Luna: "Dest, I've gotta question?"

Destiny: "Yeup?"

Luna: "Wat's a milocondria?"

Destiny: (I have no idea!)

Lance: "Aye?" *He looked at Luna in confusion, attempting to hide his shock.* "Hot chocolate?"

Luna: "Hot chocolate?"

Lance: "Yea, that's wat I said? I thought blind people had better hearin', aye."

Luna: "Get ova yourself."

Darkwings: "Skree!" *Their screeches gathered everyone's attention to another wave running out of the forest towards them.*

Luna: "More?"
Lance: "You shittin' me?!"
Nathan: (There's still more?) *He looked worried.*

Holland: "Let's go, Freya."

Freya: "Ruff-" *She pounced over Holland and growled, stepping onto the ground.*

Holland: "Go all out, girl!"

Freya: (Alright!) *She sounded excited and sprinted like a cheetah towards a group of Darkwings.*

Darkwing: "Skrah?" *It noticed Freya charging towards another Darkwing and its head cracked itself into the shape of a bow.*

Destiny: *She stared at the Darkwing with heightened vision.* (Did you see that?!)

Luna: (Its skull cracked!)
Nathan: (That thing is more than double-jointed!) *Their thoughts caused Destiny to meow in agreement.*

Darkwing: "Skree!" *It stood on all fours and shot out several skeletal arrows at Freya.*

Freya: *She jumped from side to side, avoiding the arrows while keeping her vision on her target.* "Grr-"

Destiny: (Nathan, you should strike the one attacking that Scoldrant!-)

Nathan: (Yeah, will do!) *He kept focus on the Darkwing that attacked Freya, causing him to run towards it.*

Destiny: (He's so quick now-)

Nathan: "Harh!" *He jumped up and sliced the Darkwing's head off, causing it to puff into dust.*

Holland: "Thanks-"

Nathan: *He grunted and landed on the ground, standing up straight.* (Holland?) *He looked at Holland and flicked his sword, ignoring the streams of dust that poured off its blade.*

Destiny: (Say something!) "Yeup?"

Nathan: (Destiny?)

Holland: (That's right, he said he won't talk until he's finished his goals-) *He awkwardly stared at Nathan, nodding his head in recollection.*

Nathan: "Anytime, Holland." *He smiled at Holland like he was his best friend.*

Holland: *He paused in confusion.* "You remember-?"

Nathan: "We'll talk later."

Freya: *She sprinted into striking distance and raised her jaw, gargling water.* (Gargling Whirlpool.)

Darkwing: "Skrah." *It shot out a skeletal arrow at Freya, watching it spiral towards her head.*

Freya: *She jumped up, causing her ears and tail to flap downwards.* "Brarh!" *She roared out a whirlpool of water towards the Darkwing.*

Darkwing: *It noticed the vortex of water, causing it to jump to the side.* "Skree-"

Destiny: (Let's make our move, Luna?!)

Luna: "Pssht, wateva-" *She smirked and stood in an archer's stance.*

Lance: *He looked at Luna in confusion.* "Ain't ya tired from usin' your Owgee?"

Luna: *She flicked her fingernail and pulled on a string of lightning, watching it form itself into a bow.* "Windstream Shot."

Darkwing: *It looked up, waiting for Freya to land.* "Skree-" *An arrow of wind shot through its head, causing it to tumble across the dirt.*

Luna: "Ch'yeah!"
Destiny: "Yeup!" *They stared at the tumbling Darkwing, ignoring the lightning bow which zapped in and around Luna's hand.*

Freya: *She landed on the ground, looking behind her to Luna.* (Thank you.)

Luna: (Nah, it's kool.) *She smiled at Freya.*

Lance: *He pouted and frowned at Luna.* "Yea? Well, check this out. Owgee."

Luna: "You've already shown me the different variants of ya mist-"

Lance: *He raised both arms in the air, frowning in deep mental preparation.* "Brazza's Supreme Strobe Light Storm."

Luna: (Is that the same incantation he used before?)

Destiny: (No it wasn't!)

Season: (Brazza's what-?) *Lightning as thick as trees struck down around him, causing him to look slightly intimidated.* (The Neurons are unbelievable!-)

Holland: *He watched thick strikes of lightning explode each Darkwing upon impact.* (Wow, Lance's lightning looks like a real thunderstorm's lightning right now.)

Nathan: (Brazza? Lance.. He's using his technique-) *He tightly held the sword, staring past the lightning towards Lance.* (We've both grown even stronger than we last saw each other, thanks to you, Ordin..)

----------

Ginger: "Yeoshh." *She stood up straight, glancing at Blake.* "Any more smaller hostiles?"

Blake: *He shook his head and gave Ginger a thumbs up.* "All good, my spice."

Karol: (Gingarh defeated them all!)

Ginger: *She paused.* "Ey, Blake? Are there any more hostiles?"

Blake: *He dropped his shoulders with a tired smile.* "Nah, you totes got 'em all."

Tyler: *He stared at Ginger with a dropping jaw.* (That was a scary Ougi-)

Ginger: *She looked up to the massive Darkwing, glaring at it with emotion.* "For this city, my home. I will take action-"

*Ginger casually threw her shurikens, causing them to spiral around her.*

Karol: "Gingarh is amayzing."

Rachael: "We're lucky she's a part of our guild, Karol."

Lezard: *He looked at Ginger, noticing the party stare at her.* "The party focused their attention to Ginger-"

PKMY: "Ssh-"

Lezard: "Ooo?" *The light around his hands faded, causing him to look down to the awakening PKMY and Alicia.* "Welcome back, ladies."

Alicia: "Lezard?"
PKMY: "You talk too much."

Lezard: "Join Lezard's harem and no more words will be spoken from his lips."

Ginger: "Gravel and sand manipulate to my command-" *She flicked her hand up towards the Darkwing and streams of sand swirled in front, instantly forming a boulder.*

Lezard: "Unlike the normal healing procedure, you two delicious ladies can stand back up now."

PKMY: "Heh-"
Alicia: "Thank you so very much, Lezard."

PKMY: (Gravel and sand manipulate? I remember this incantation!-) *Images of Tarlea flashed in her head, causing her to grit her teeth.*

Ginger: "Move like a drill and make them feel, COMET'S VIEL"

Tyler: (Wow, besides Felix, I haven't seen much ground-based Rostical-)

Ginger: "Yoh!-" *The boulder shot forward at incredible speeds, causing fire to spurt on its sides.*

Rachael: *Her crystal daggers, sparkled due to the light of the fire.* (Ginger, that's a destructive Rostical-)

*The comet-like boulder hit the Darkwing, causing an eruption of flames to whirl around it.*

Ginger: (I did not place any additional Neurons in that Remenistal, logically, this dictates that the Rasticsplash should not cause severe damage to my city-)

Joy: (It's even brighter and larger than PKMY's fire attack-)

Darkwing: *It raised its massive bone arm and waved it across the flames, causing them to extinguish.* "Skararh!"

Ginger: "Yoh-?!" *She stepped back in shock.* "No effect!?"

Dawn: "This interests research. Its Shadiaton-like cloak has the ability to put out flames if it's dense enough?" *She ended the sentence with a question-sounding tone as if she wasn't fully sure herself.*

Lezard: "What's the plan, children?!"

Rachael: "We have no choice now. We'll have to combine our attacks and hope we don't destroy much of the city! Is everyone alright with this decision?!"

*Several warriors and bystanders nodded their heads in agreement.*

Ginger: (Ykkt! That is the only logical conclusion we have come up with!) *She frowned in thought, visibly displeased with the idea.* (Otherwise, it will keep spawning more hostiles!)

----------

Season: "Time to end this-" *He reached behind his back and unsheathed out a red trident, which stood three times taller than him.*

Nathan: *The sounds of metal scraping caught his attention and he observed the trident, watching sparks spiral around it.* (What kind of weapon is that?)

*The sword vibrated in Nathan's hand, causing him to look down at it in shock.*

Nathan: (It's another weapon of memories?)

Season: "Everyone, jump!"

Lance: "Huh?"

Nathan: "Right!" *He grunted and jumped high into the air.*

Luna: "Herh." *She bent down and pushed herself up into the air, blowing a pulse of dirt where she stood.*

Destiny: *She flew up with Luna, ensuring their vision matched the height of the jump.*

Lance: "Wha-?" *He looked around in confusion, awkwardly hopping up.*

Holland: "Freya!"

Freya: "Growlith!-" *She dived down and swooped Holland off his feet, flapping her wings into the air.*

Luna: *She looked down, glancing at Lance.* (Why is he hoppin'?)

Destiny: (Is it possible he can't jump up?)

Luna: (Ya rekon? I don't think so, aye. He can perform two powerful Owgees but not skilled enough to jump higher than normal?)

Season: "Power of the white lights absorb and synthesise the natural power, patiently gather and redirect at the supreme power you hold and lend us-"

*Season raised his hand above his head, causing a white glyph to expand around it.*

Season: *He grabbed the trident with both hands and straightened them in front, watching a white glyph materialise in front of him.* "SOLAR FLARE"

Lance: "I can't-"

*A beam of white light with a blue fluoro shading blasted into the distance, flapping Season's robes and hair back.*

Lance: *He noticed Season slowly twirling, causing him to stare at the beam with urgency and worry.* "Holy flamin' shit nuggets!-"

*Lance looked up to the other party members in shock, waving his arms like a child.*

Lance: "I can't jump that high!-"

Nathan: "Use the motion to flashstep but jump into the air instead!" *He yelled from the air.*

Lance: (Shit, shit, shit-) *He grunted and jumped high into the air, causing him to gasp at himself in a surprised manner.*

Season: "Harh!-" *He slowly spiralled around, causing the beam to blast in all directions.*

Lance: *He looked down, glancing at the beam in shock.* "Holy flyin' fudge nuggets!" *He slowly started to descend, causing him to squeak like a girl.*

Season: (I did a full circle-) *He sighed and slowly lowered his arms, causing the beam to dissipate into small white orbs.*

*Nathan, Luna and Lance dropped onto the ground and looked around, lowering their weapons.*

Nathan: "You got them all?"

Luna: *She closed her eyes.* (Destiny, do you sense anything?)

Destiny: *She scanned across the battlefield, looking at the heat signatures around the party.* (No, there doesn't seem to be any more of those creatures in the area, yeup.)

Luna: *She opened her eyes, shaking her head.* "You got 'em all."

Season: "Splendid." *He coughed in satisfaction, brushing the robes on his arms.*

Lance: "Umm, Season, when could ya shoot beams-?"

*Vibrations rumbled along the ground, catching the party's attention.*

Destiny: (Luna! I feel a disturbance in the city!)

Lance: "Aye?"

Season: "Th-That came from the city-"

Lance and Luna: "Shit."

Nathan: (Darn it.) *He gritted his teeth and frowned, looking at the aura path.*

Holland: "We did leave a large amount of those creatures in there-" *He glided on Freya above the party, looking down at them in concern.*

Freya: "Growlith!" *She flapped her wings, flying towards the city.*

Luna: (I don't think Rach would let anything get out of hand-) "Nath, let's go." *She started to run towards the city, catching his attention.*

Nathan: "Yeah." *He raised the sword and placed it over his shoulder, causing it to blur.*

Season: "We've done what was needed." *He looked at Nathan and started to hobble towards the aura path.*

Nathan: *The sword faded behind his back, allowing him to lower his arms.* "You coming?" *He glanced at Lance and stepped forward, running towards the city.*

Lance: "Yea, I'll be there." *He watched the party enter the city, causing him to bend down in fatigue.* (What is with my power lately? First I feel great, then I keep gettin' these sick urges-)

*Lance dropped to his knees and was covered in sweat, causing him to touch his forehead in confusion.*

Lance: (I'm sweatin'?) *Images of Luna using her Ougi flashed in his mind.* (She.. She's so strong, aye..)

----------

Season: *He stumbled behind Luna, Holland, Freya and Nathan, watching them stare in front in shock.* "What appears to be the prob-?"

Luna: (Wat's that?!)

Destiny: (It's gigantic!)

Season: *He stopped and froze in shock, looking at the Darkwing with a dropping jaw.* (It's massive!)

Nathan: *He ignored the Darkwing and looked further down the road-like path, noticing the guild.* "One thing about large opponents is that they're slower than normal."

Luna: "The plan, Nath?" *She looked at him with her white eyes, causing him to smile.*

Nathan: "Let's go up to the guild and find out what's happened-"

Darkwing: "Skrargh!" *It looked to its side and waved its arm, causing a nearby house to smash into pieces.*

Ginger: "No!" *She screamed in anger, ignoring the gasps of terror.*

Rachael: (It's so large, nobody wants to make any sudden moves or it'll react and damage the city-)

Lezard: *He watched the debris smash into the ground around the Darkwing's feet.* (This is not a fortunate position to be in-)

Chrisma: *She looked at the Darkwing, worryingly biting the side of her lip.* "Who-?" *Footsteps caught her attention.*

Lezard: *He smiled and coughed to clear his throat.* "Our ravaging ruler of Surpreon, mr muscles, Nathapoo and Loonzamotto ran up to Razzypoo, keeping a cautious, fixated-like stare on the Darkwing."

Chrisma: "You have such a uniquely beautifully way of speaking."

Rachael: *She ignored Lezard and Chrisma.* "How is the outside?"

Nathan: "We wouldn't be in here if it wasn't cleared."

Rachael: "Right, that monstrosity is the result of all the creatures merging together."

Season: "Like before." *He mumbled to himself in recollection.*

Tyler: "Season." *He sounded worried, as he stared at the towering Darkwing.*

Blake: *He flashstepped next to Ginger, keeping his fixated stare up to the sky.* "This creature, why don't you continue firing off your Rostical?"

Ginger: "Logically, it may be the best solution."

Luna: "Oi, Rach-" *She glanced at Season.* "Season is a powerful Rostickal User, why not have him and Ginger combine powers?"

Season: "Hmm?"

Joy: "That could work."

Tyler: (In theory that is-)

Darkwing: *It slowly turned around and faced the entrance, causing the ground to rumble.* "Skrarargh!" *It leant back as if it inhaled deeply.*

Cameron: "The air around it shifted.."

Destiny: *She stared at the Darkwing with inverted vision, allowing her to see water-like movement of energy inside its bones.* (Do you see that?!)

Luna: (Yea!-) "Its aura has changed-"

Karol: "W-Wha?" *He squealed like a girl, crossing his arms over his stomach in a nervous manner.*

Rachael: (Karol's been through a lot, I'm really surprised and proud that he's out here fighting right now. But it's obvious he's not at his best-)

Darkwing: *A sphere of darkness grew in front of its mouth.* "Sk-k-k-k."

Ginger: "Yoh? A new attack!"

Lance: *He walked into the city with his chest puffed out.* "Hmm?" *He stopped, staring at the Darkwing with an emotionless face.*

Chief: *He stepped forward and stared at the Darkwing in shock, fixating all his attention to the sphere of darkness.* "It's charging something powerful!-"

Lance: "So, this is wat the commotion's 'bout?" *He closed his eyes and his fingers twitched.* (Now I feel fine.)

Luna: (Aye? Is that-? Those my stupid brother's Newgongs?)

Lance: *He half smirked and opened his eyes, twiddling his fingers in determination.* (It feels like a surge of energy is coursin' through my body!-)

Whitehead: *He looked over to the entrance, pointing the cutlass swords at Lance.* "There's a man over there!"

Lezard: *He held onto his cone-shaped hat and grabbed Alicia's hand, helping her to her feet.* "There we go."

Alicia: "Th-Thank you-"

Lezard: "And-" *He faced PKMY, reaching out to pick her up.*

PKMY: "Pssht." *She grunted, slapping his hand away.*

Lezard: "Oh, goodness-" *He withdrew his hand in fright.* "Don't eat me, boisterous woman-"

PKMY: "Wat have we missed?" *She grunted and stood up, cracking her knuckles.*

Alicia: "I-I don't know-"

Lezard: "The mass of creatures all formed into this one being. It frightens the kittens out of me."

Rachael: "Lance is at the entrance?"

Alicia: "Lance-" *She whispered and stared at him, who stood by himself near the entrance.*

Luna: "Aye? Wat took him so long?"

Nathan: "I don't know. I thought he was right behind us."

Destiny: (Why is it focused on him?!)

Lance: *He looked at his hands and formed fists.* "Rightio... Lightning strike both sides-"

*Lance lifted his arms and crossed them, causing wing-like sparks of lightning to spark on either side.*

Blake: *He gave Lance a feral look.* (What does he think he's going to do, to a creature like that-?)

Lance: "Flashing and flowing, call upon the secrets-" *He fluidly swirled his arms and twirled around, causing a vortex of thick red lightning to whirl around him.*

Blake: "Bitch, say wha? The lightning is red." *He hissed to himself, staring at the lightning with heightened vision.*

Ginger: (That incantation, it is Dragon's Breath-)

Darkwing: *Its jaw dropped, causing bones to crack.* "Sk-k-k."

Tyler: (Its jaw, that's so scary looking-)

Nathan: "It looks like it's about to release its attack!"

Cameron: "I concur!-"

Darkwing: "Hoooooooaaarr-" *It started to suck the air in around it, causing the ball of shadow to grow in size.*

Ginger: (I have no choice but to use my second Ougi to stop this hostile!)

Lance: "Summon the beast of roaring thunder-" *He stopped and crossed his arms above his head, causing the swirling lightning to become idle.*

Ginger: "Ey?" *She quickly looked at Lance, causing the glyphs on her arms to pulsate.* (That man?! His Astragons are resonating on such a level, the glyphs on my arms are responding!-)

Lance: *He hopped on one foot and pointed at the large Darkwing.* "DRAGON'S BREATH"

Lezard: *He watched the area turn to darkness, causing the red lightning around Lance to become more distinctive.* "Good night, children?"

*A red thick tornado-like swirl of lightning rumbled towards the Darkwing, taking shape of a dragon's head.*

Lance: *He formed a fist as lightning sparked past his determined yet emotionless face.* (I haven't used this since releasin' that seal.)

PKMY: (Those Neuron levels. It's almost as if he's using Grand Rostical!-)

Chrisma: "Holy, shit your face!-" *She groaned in disbelief, quickly covering her face.*

Lance: *The lightning grew larger, brightening the surrounding area.* (I feel every stream of lightning, I sense every static, I breathe every spark-)

*Season and Ginger gasped at the lightning as arms and legs sprouted from the lightning.*

Tyler: *He held a fixated stare at the lightning in amazement.* (A lightning dragon! It's like something from one of his stupid games-)

Lance: (I feel my Newrongs and Astragongs being sucked into the lightning-) *Swirls of dust blew across the ground.*

Darkwing: *Its shadow blew back due to the incoming lightning.* "Sk-k-k?"

Lance: "I can manipulate this to any form I want!" *The lightning roared like thunder and the dragon's head spiralled around the entire Darkwing in a flash.*

PKMY: *Her hair blew back as she stared at the lightning in amazement.* (This level of power, it exceeds my own!)

Ginger: (I have mastered this Remenistal myself and mine isn't like this?!) *Her long black hair rapidly flapped behind her.*

Luna: (Lance?!)

Rachael: "U-Unimaginable?" (How unreal!-)

Luna: (Wat an effin' showoff!)
Destiny: "Yeu yeu!" *She quickly flew down into Luna's arms, ensuring she didn't blow away from the growing wind.*

Lance: "Now, get outta my sight!"

*The dragon roared in the Darkwing's face before consuming the sphere of darkness it created.*

Lezard: "Oh my-" *He spoke in disbelief, sarcastically wiggling his bottom.*

Holland: (It just swallowed the creature's black sphere!)

Blake: (That lightning looks like it's the size of The Elemental Tower!) *He shook his head in disbelief, as his dragon-like wings retracted back into his body.*

Lance: "Harh!" *He opened his fist and the lightning exploded into a plume of green flames.*

Alicia: *Her face glowed an eerie green due to the flames.* "L-Lance..."

Rachael: *She gasped in realisation, discreetly glancing at Luna.* (He might be like Luna!-)

*The green flames caused the Darkwing to pulse downwards into a swirl of dust.*

Karol: "Y-Yah-" *He squealed and looked away, as a pulse of dust violently blew past him.*

Blake: "Like, whoa."

Nathan: (He still had this power kept hidden?!)

Ginger: *Her hair and robes rapidly flapped backwards as she intensely stared at the falling dust with widening eyes.* "H-He defeated it?"

Lezard: *He closed his eyes and held onto his cone-shaped hat, feeling the dust-filled wind blow past him.* (Jinkies!)

Blake: *He looked at Ginger, noticing her facial expression.* (Even my sexy spice is shocked!)

Luna: "Wat the effin' shit nuggets did my brother just do?"

Rachael: "He.. Just singlehandedly defeated it.." *She spoke as if she didn't believe it.*

Lance: *He bent forward and struggled to breathe, noticing slight vein-like burns around his hands.* (My energy-)

*Several screeches echoed outside the city, catching Lance's attention.*

Lance: (There's a few more left outside?) *He held his breath and turned around, running outside the city.*

Holland: "Where's he going now?"

Whitehead: *The wind died down and the area reverted back to normal, causing him to lower his cutlass swords.* "W-What the violent seas just happened?!"

Alicia: (Lance!-) *She stood up straight and looked at Lezard.* "Thank you very much for healing me."

Lezard: "No thankies needed. A smile is all I need."

PKMY: *She rolled her eyes behind Lezard.* (What a loser-) *She sighed in thought and started to walk towards Holland and Ginger.*

Alicia: (Lance..) *She faced the entrance and started to run towards it.* (What are you doing?)

Holland: "Did Lance really do all that?" *He stared at the large dust pile, watching a gust of wind blow it away.*

Joy: (And like that, it's gone?)

Karol: "Waichael?"

Rachael: *She smiled at Karol and placed a hand on his cheek.* "How are you feeling?"

Karol: "I'm ohkay." *He slowly exhaled and lowered his arms, sniffing several times unintentionally showing his exhaustion.*

Season: *He hobbled up to Holland with Rachael and Tyler.* "Even a mastered version of Dragon's Breath cannot produce those results."

PKMY: *She shuffled up to Holland and held his hand, resting her head against his arm.* (I'm tired-)

Tyler: "Then what just happened?"

Ginger: "I have a theory, please respond?" *She glanced over to Luna, catching her attention.*

Luna: *She walked up to the guild, looking at Ginger in a curious manner.* "Yea, you've got my permission to speak."

Destiny: "Yeup." *She hovered behind Luna, landing on her shoulder.* (Be nicer, Luna.)

Luna: (Wateva. I'm too tired to give a shit.)

Rachael: "What's your theory?"

Dawn: "Thank you, research-" *She spoke under her breath and dropped to her knees as drone-like machines burst into white liquid.*

Ginger: "Well, think of our limits as one container. But, in Luna's condition-"

PKMY: "Condition-?"

Season: "Continue." *He mumbled, rubbing his chin in an interested manner.*

PKMY: (Wateva.)

Ginger: "I believe she has two containers. So her potential is twice as much as ours."

Luna: (Wat's she tryin' to say?)

Destiny: (I think she's complimenting you?)

Season: "Why do you believe Lance has two of these containers?"

Whitehead: "Argh, what happened?" *He staggered up to the party in confusion, scraping the cutlass swords against each other by habit.*

Tyler: "Perhaps I could explain-" *He walked next to Season and faced Whitehead.* "We believe that the enemy we're chasing after somehow manifested these creatures."

Chrisma: "G-Get in?" *She walked with Joy and stopped next to Tyler, tugging on her green robes.*

PKMY: "The Consultant." *She grunted, slightly avoiding eye contact with Rachael.*

Ginger: (The Consultant is responsible!)

Lezard: "You mean to tell Lezard that your final villain can create an army of unsavoury monsters?"

Tyler: *He nodded his head.* "I personally believe this isn't the last time we'll see these creatures."

Joy: "I hope you're wrong."

Tyler: "M-Me too." *He enthusiastically nodded his head in agreement, resting an arm over his RPG bag.*

Blake: *He stood next to the chief, looking at Tyler in an annoyed manner.* "More of those things? We've already got tons of problems, aye."

*Karol and Nathan walked up to the party, standing next to Blake.*

Rachael: *She looked at Nathan, placing one hand on her waist.* "Well?"

Nathan: "Only the one house was damaged." *He sounded relieved.*

Karol: "Oh, a-and the bwridge on the top." *He pointed above him to the hole in the bridge.*

Tyler: *He looked up and stared at a hole, noticing shards of wood poke out of the bridge.* (From Alicia?)

Lezard: "That Hi-Ougi sent shivers down these old bones." *He held himself and wiggled his bottom.*

Whitehead: "Herm, this man sounds dangerous." *He mumbled in a pirate-like manner, understanding the threat.*

Season: "Also, I have bad news to tell you all-" *He spoke to all his party members while facing Whitehead.*

Joy: "Not more?" *She spoke under her breath, patiently waiting for Season to speak.*

Season: "Unfortunate to say, I don't have the funds you ask for."

Whitehead: "For?" *He grunted in confusion, placing the cutlass swords in his robe-like belt.*

Season: "The ship."

Whitehead: "Oh." *He rocked back as if he remembered what Season was talking about.*

Rachael: (Funds?) *She looked at Season in confusion, glancing at Whitehead with a frown.* (I'm not sure what agenda they have planned, but Whitehead has always been greedy. Now I know why out of all the guilds, he's the most better off than the rest of us.)

Whitehead: *He grunted, observing the damage of the city.* "Is this the same man who caused these creatures to attack the city?"

Season: "Correct."

Chrisma: "Y-Yes, the Consultant!" *She groaned in disgust and pretended to scratch the air, causing Tyler to look at her strangely.*

Whitehead: "Hermm." *He looked down in thought, rubbing his beard.*

Cameron: *He touched his throat, causing him to look up.* (Thank you, that is enough.)

Apollo: "Squawk." *He squawked in acknowledgement and flapped his wings, suddenly disintegrating into tiny white orbs.*

Nathan: *He noticed Blake, Ginger, Rachael, Luna, Karol and Lezard gathering around him.* "Is everyone okay?"

Lezard: "Indeedly-do. Does anyone need healing?"

Whitehead: (It would actually cost me more if those things were to attack again-) "I've got a change of mind."

Bandit: "Boss?" *He grunted in shock, standing next to Whitehead.*

Whitehead: "The only charges I request are the amount needed to power Sheridan to your destination. Only because we're very low on energy at the moment."

Season: "That seems reasonable."

Bandit: "Are you sure, boss?"

Whitehead: "Yes."

Cameron: "But we do not have any?"

Simone: *She stumbled out from her booth and walked up to Tyler, catching the party's attention.* "I couldn't help but overhear-" *She stared at Tyler, causing him to nervously face her.*

Tyler: (It's that manager-)

Simone: "You're a friend of Lance?"

Tyler: "Umm, yes?"

Simone: "And he's travelling on the same quest as you?"

Season: "Indeed."

Simone: "Then this will help on your travels-" *She reached for Tyler's hand and dropped several stones in it.* "It should be way more than enough."

Whitehead: *He noticed the stones in Tyler's hand, causing him to greedily chuckle in excitement.* "And that should be enough."

Tyler: *He looked at Simone, shaking his head in a hesitant manner.* "But-?"

Simone: "The sales we did. We've already sold out of buns. It's the very least I can do for you."

Season: "Many thanks."

Tyler: "Th-Thank you."

Simone: *She smiled and slightly bowed.* "I have to go and help clean the city-" *She turned around and started to walk towards a cluster of bystanders in the distance.*

Whitehead: "With this-" *He presented his hand, twiddling his fingers at Tyler.*

Tyler: "Here-" *He mumbled and stepped forward, dropping the stones in Whitehead's palm.*

Whitehead: "I can exchange and receive the Rosterology jewels to power her up." *He looked over his shoulder and handed the stones over to one of his men.* "Get them now."

Bandit: "Boss!" *He turned around and started to run towards the lower level.*

Whitehead: "It'll take a few moments to prepare the materials.. Wait outside and I'll escort you to her."

Tyler: "This is great?"

Holland: "Yeah." *He smiled and scratched his cheek, causing PKMY to smile.*

PKMY: (The first time I felt positive emotions all day-)

Season: "Okay-" *He glanced across the party, standing in a leadership manner.* "I know we're a little tired..."

*Season paused and looked at each party member, noticing the wounds they received during their fight with the Darkwings.*

Season: "But we've already wasted half of the day-"

PKMY: *She nodded her head, stepping forward.* "We're too close, we can't miss our chance to get the Consultant."

Tyler: "We shouldn't rest." *He looked at PKMY in agreement.*

PKMY: "Yea, we can rest after we kill him-" *She looked at the entrance and nudged Holland, causing him to slowly walk towards it.*

Holland: *He held his throat in fatigue.* (Freya?)

Freya: *She continued to glide in a large circle in the air.* (I understand-) *She lowered her head and closed her eyes, disintegrating into tiny white orbs.*

Tyler: *He glanced at Season and adjusted the RPG bag over his shoulder.* "I'll meet you outside."

Season: "Alright." *He noticed Cameron standing next to Blake.* "And, Cameron. What will you do now?"

Cameron: "I err-" *He coughed and stepped away from Blake as if he was doing something bad.* "I want to assist the party in the defeat of the Consultant."

Season: *He smiled, slightly bowing in appreciation.* "I'll meet you outside then."

Cameron: "Indeed." *He nodded his head in respect and focused his attention back to Blake.*

Season: "Joy and Chrisma-"

Joy: "Yes?"

Season: "I would like you two stay here and give feedback to what has happened to Dawn."

Chrisma: "No, I want-"

Joy: *She covered Chrisma's mouth in respect.* "That should be no problem."

Season: "Thank you."

Lezard: "Rachael, Luna, Nathan, Karol, Blake and Ginger. Now is the time we must depart."

Luna: "We're not ready yet?"

Destiny: "Yeup."

Nathan: *He suddenly looked concerned.* "I'm more worried he didn't give us his nicknames."

Ginger: "Ey, Nate, sound observation. Please state the issue? We have yet to decide our course of action-"

Lezard: "I don't mean as a party." *He sounded serious, catching the guild's attention.* "Or a guild."

Luna: "Wat?"
Ginger: "Ey, Lezard?"
Karol: *He shook his head, facing Lezard in sadness.* "What?"

Rachael: (I knew it..)

Nathan: *He looked at Rachael.* "Aren't you going to say anything?"

Rachael: *She looked up with closed eyes and awkwardly smiled.* "Depart? What are you talking about?"

----------

Alicia: *She ran outside and noticed Lance standing on the spot motionless.* "Lance?"

Lance: "I thought I heard more, but it must've been my imagination." *He lowered his head.*

Alicia: *She stepped on the dirt, running up to Lance.* "That was amazing!"

Lance: "..."

Alicia: *She giggled and looked at Lance's face, causing her to look confused.* "W-What's wrong?"

Lance: "N-Nothin'." *He smiled with sadness and looked at Alicia, tightly hugging her.* "I feel better now."

Alicia: "W-Why?"

Lance: "'Cause you're in my arms." *He closed his eyes, kissing her on the head.*

Alicia: *She smiled with blushing cheeks and held Lance's head, suddenly noticing the vein-like burns.* "L-Lance?"

Lance: "Yea?" *He smiled in response, looking down to her worried face.* "Wat's up?"

Alicia: "Your burns."

Lance: *He noticed the burns around his hands, causing him to brush it off with a chuckle.* "I'm fine, aye-"

Alicia: "You need to be more careful with your lightning."

Lance: "Huh?" *Alicia's words triggered a flashback.*

--

Lance: "So, I can like, call a lightning storm 'n' stuff now?" *He spoke in excitement as if he was going to abuse the power.*

Brazza: "You need to be careful with lightning."

Lance: "Aye?"

Brazza: (Back in my training days-..) *He shook his head as if he had no time to explain.*

Lance: "Brendza?"

Brazza: "Here-" *He spoke in a deep voice, presenting a blue crystal to Lance.*

Lance: "Wat's this?"

Brazza: "A captain classed warrior that doesn't know what a Crystalline Blossom is?" *He spoke in a confused, playful manner and focused, causing a red dye to fill the crystal.*

Lance: "Aye? The Crystalline Blossom is now red?"

Brazza: "Actually, it's a Crystalline Membrane now."

Lance: "Aye-?" *He grabbed the crystal in confusion, slightly shaking his head.*

Brazza: "Just pour Neurons into it when you're ready."

Lance: "Umm, OK?" *He slowly reached behind, causing the crystal to disappear.* "Wat's on it?"

Brazza: "I'm off, catchya."

--

Lance: (I almost forgot-) *He slowly reached over his shoulder and pulled his arm forward, revealing a red crystal to Alicia.*

Alicia: *She looked at the crystal and watched sparks splinter around it, shaking her head.* "Let me heal-"

Lance: "I wonder what it's about, aye?"

Alicia: *She shook her head again as if she didn't care about this crystal.* "Lance-"

Lance: "Watch it with me?" *He grunted in a relaxed manner, gently placing the crystal on Alicia's hand.*

Alicia: "You can show me later?"

Lance: "I have a gut feelin' we should watch it now."

Alicia: "But, your wounds-"

Lance: "Please?"

Alicia: *She paused and hesitantly nodded her head, knowing they were on a time schedule.* "O-Okay.."

Lance: (Just pour Neurons into it-) *He closed his eyes and focused, causing a swirl of wind to blow in their faces.*

Alicia: "Where did the wind-?"

*A younger version of Brazza ran through grassy fields behind an older man with a younger version of Pickles and another teenager with orange hair.*

Brazza: "Brother! When are we there?!" *He shouted at the man in front, keeping his incredible running speed.*

?????: *He continued to run, focusing his attention ahead.* "..."

Pickles: *She looked to her side at Brazza, sighing smoke-like mist in an annoyed manner.* "He's been doing this for a while, let him do his thing."

Brazza: "Shush." *He spoke in a deep voice, frowning at the man's back.*

Pickles: *She looked to her other side, staring at the woman with orange hair.* "What do you think, Vanguard?"

Vanguard: "Yeah, sure. He's our fucking teacher."

Pickles: *She looked back to Brazza, nodding her head.* "See-?"

Brazza: "Ethan!" *He shouted in front, causing the man to turn around.*

Ethan: "Shush, you." *He smirked and flicked his head, swaying hair out of his face.* "We're almost there-"

Pickles: *She smiled, rocking her head in an impressed manner.* "Naice."

Vanguard: "Jajaja, see, Brazza?" *She spoke with a chuckle, keeping a fixated stare on Ethan.*

Pickles: "So, let's run through the plan one more time."

Ethan: "You're all quite strong with your manipulating abilities-"

Vanguard: "Ethan, we're out of Sorrowprax, just tell us what the fucking mission is."

Ethan: "The Consultant-"

Vanguard: "Consultant, consultant, they're not here, so, who the fuck cares about the warrior's formalities."

Pickles: "You shouldn't talk down to the Consultant, Vanguard."

Vanguard: "Always so loyal, Pickles, jajaja." *She laughed and purposely drifted away from Pickles.*

Pickles: "We don't have a choice in the matter, we might as well stick to the rules."

Vanguard: "How fucking embarrassing-"

Pickles: "The only thing that's embarrassing, is your respect-"

Ethan: "Our mission is to defeat a Remenistal Using Scoldrant."

Brazza: "Brother?" *He spoke in a deep voice, raising an eyebrow in a curious manner.*

Ethan: (The Consultant wants to know if they're worthy of their single digit status-)

Vanguard: "Is that all?"

Pickles: "We've been training for years, any one of us can take down a Remenistal Using Scoldrant."

Vanguard: "I surprisingly agree."

Pickle: "Hehe, yeah." *She spoke with no enthusiasm, focusing all her attention on Ethan.*

Brazza: "We all may be vice captain level, but our abilities easily match captain digit status."

Vanguard: "Jajaja." *She chuckled under her breath, smirking confidently.*

Ethan: "Let's go-" *He spoke with a smirk and bent one knee, suddenly flashstepping out of sight.*

Vanguard: "Wait for us!"

Brazza: "Tssk-" *He frowned in determination, quickly flashstepping out of the field.*

--

Lance: *He inhaled deeply through his nose, slowly leaning away from the crystal.* "Whoa-"

Alicia: "I-I don't get it?" *She looked at Lance in confusion, holding her pendant with one hand.*

Lance: "Me neither."

Alicia: "Pickles looks younger in this memory."

Lance: (Memory?) "You know her?"

Alicia: "She was my opponent."

Lance: "Really? Aha, that Brenda guy was mine."

Alicia: "Brenda-?"

Lance: "There's more-" *He quickly focused back to the crystal, triggering another flashback.*

--

*Ethan, Brazza, Pickles and Vanguard all flashstepped in a flowery, farm-like meadow, causing swirls of yellow petals to ring around them.*

Ethan: "Be careful, apparently this Scoldrant has the ability to re-spawn."

Brazza: "Watevs."

Pickles: "Brazza, stop being so cocky-"

Brazza: *He sighed, blowing hair out of his eyes in a bored manner.* "Pickles, you're amazing and all that, but you don't have my affinity, this will be easy for me."

Pickles: *She stepped forward, frowning at Brazza.* "You don't understand-"

Vanguard: "He's right, Pickles. Ice is fucken shit-"

Pickles: *She quickly stepped to the side, glaring at Vanguard.* "And so are you, but you don't see me saying it?"

Ethan: *He looked into the distance, slowly closing his eyes.* (You don't know how right she is, my brother...)

Brazza: *He raised his arm, causing swirls of red lightning to spiral around his hand.* "Let's finish this quickly, so we can laze around after."

Vanguard: "Jajaja, that's my way of thinking!" *She smirked and suddenly felt tremors in the ground, causing her to look down.* "Yah?"

Ethan: *He casually turned around and opened his eyes, standing in a battle-ready pose.* "It's here-"

*An enormous snake, vine-like Scoldrant erupted out of the ground, towering high into the air.*

Pickles: *She looked up with widening eyes, slowly exhaling mist.* (It's a plant?)

Scoldrant: *It opened its mouth, giving the illusion a massive flower bloomed.* "Fllorw."

Brazza: "Too easy-" *He sprinted towards the Scoldrant, blasting a warped stream of lightning at the Scoldrant.*

Vanguard: "Jajajaja!" *She smiled and flashstepped next to Brazza, suddenly punching balls of fire at the Scoldrant.*

Ethan: (None of these Elementalists possesses the Elemental Rage ability, but lightning-) *He looked down, watching thick red lightning flash around his arm.*

Scoldrant: *It swivelled to each side, avoiding the balls of fire.* "Floaar."

Brazza: *He watched the Scoldrant split into two, causing the lightning to blast straight through it.* "Huh?"

Vanguard: "Grr-" *She spun around and kicked the air, sweeping a curved wave of red flames towards the Scoldrant.*

Brazza: "I'm not done!" *He spread his arms, causing static-like lightning to flash towards the Scoldrant.*

Scoldrant: "LIFA BLOSSOM" *It moaned and unnaturally whipped back, watching Vanguard's flames extinguish in the air.*

Vanguard: (The bastard moved out of attacking range-) *Two vines suddenly wrapped themselves around her neck, causing her to gag for air.*

Ethan: "Pickles?"

Pickles: *She snapped out of her line of thought, nodding her head.* "Yes, captain-" *She suddenly flashstepped above Vanguard and touched the vines, causing them to freeze.*

Vanguard: "Garh-" *She raised her arms, violently shattering the vines off her neck.* (Fuck it-)

Pickles: *She landed on the ground and faced the Scoldrant, watching ice explode in her hands.* "Naice."

Vanguard: *She frowned at herself, rubbing her neck.* (Despite this Scoldrant being weakened to my elemental affinity, the vines would've burnt my fucking neck..)

Ethan: *He gasped with widening eyes and flashstepped in front of Brazza.* "Long-range Violet Fibres."

Brazza: "Bro-?"

Ethan: "Harh!" *He blasted strings of purple lightning towards the ground near Brazza, burning directly into erupting vines.*

Vanguard: (How did he know where the vines would come from?! The fuck!)

Pickles: *She squinted her eyes, watching large explosions of purple flames extinguish the vines.* (Those vines would've struck Brazza-)

Brazza: "Spark Cannon." *He cupped his hands and pushed forward, blasting a ball of red lightning into the Scoldrant.*

Scoldrant: "Floarra-" *It moaned in pain as strings of electricity flashed up its body.*

Brazza: "I can do this." *He stepped in front of Ethan, hiding his appreciation.*

Ethan: "Brazza.."

Brazza: "Why did you do it?"

Ethan: *He looked to the side, watching the charcoaled vines sizzle.* "I'd never let anything hurt you-"

Brazza: *He formed fists with an emotionless face, suddenly running towards the Scoldrant.* (I don't need help! I have the strongest element! People fear me!)

*Vanguard and Pickles flashstepped on either side of Brazza, running towards the Scoldrant.*

Ethan: *He sighed in thought, lowering his arms.* (Brazza.. What you say is true..)

Brazza: "What are you two doing?"

Pickles: "We're friends?"

Brazza: "Yeah?"

Pickles: "If I'm forced to do something I don't want to do, I'd rather do it with my friends."

Vanguard: (Lame-)

Brazza: "..."

Pickles: "Icicle Edge." *She swayed to the side and threw an ice spear, blasting it into the Scoldrant.*

Vanguard: "Star Fire." *She screamed and punched into the air before punching downwards, causing pebble-like swirls of fire to rain down on the Scoldrant.*

Scoldrant: "Floar!" *It moaned in pain, causing it to dive back into the ground.*

Ethan: (I've hurt myself many times when I was still learning how to use my lightning-)

Brazza: "Pickles, Vanguard, we'll do a combination of attacks when it resurfaces."

Pickles: "Got it."

Vanguard: "Right." *She punched a wave of fire to the side, scorching the air behind her.* "Ready."

Ethan: (I've watched you grow up.. I've watched the power intensify.. I've watched your mind run dry...)

Brazza: "Come out!" *He pushed into the air, blasting thick streams of red lightning past Pickles.*

Pickles: *She slightly leant back, squinting her eyes at the lightning.* (I'd prefer to work under Brazza or Ethan, than I-Isaac-)

Vanguard: *She felt rumbles in the ground, causing her to glance at Brazza.* "It's coming-"

Scoldrant: "Flooawr!" *It dived out of the ground, towering over Vanguard.*

Vanguard: *She looked up with widening eyes as if she wasn't expecting the Scoldrant to attack.* (I don't!-)

Brazza: "Crud!-"

Pickles: *She spun around and cupped her hands, causing a blue glyph to spiral in front of her.* "Ice Stream Divider."

Scoldrant: *It watched bullet-like ice shatter into its body, causing it to moan at Pickles.* "BINDING VINES"

Pickles: *She gasped and swayed her green hair over her shoulder, stepping back.* (My ice doesn't damage its body well!)

Ethan: *He watched from the distance as if he was monitoring their progress.* (You all have potential, but you need experience to back up your actions-)

Brazza: "Outta the way-" *He swayed his arm, causing a fluid stream of red lightning to blast past Pickles and into an erupting vine.*

Ethan: *He watched the lightning burn the vines into ash, causing him to step forward in an urgent manner.* "That's reckless!"

Pickles: "Ougi." *She dropped to her knees and formed a square with her fingers, causing a wall of blue ice to erupt in front of her.*

Scoldrant: "Floarr!" *It watched a vine erupt and whip towards Pickles, noticing it suddenly whip back.*

Pickles: "Divinity Shard."

Vanguard: "Jarh! Can't stand the heat of the battle? Jajajaja." *She laughed and punched a vacuum-like swirl of fire, burning three green vines.*

Pickles: *She watched the vines whip away from her in a repelled-like manner.* "Naice."

Brazza: "Jolt Cage." *He spread his arms and strings of electricity formed around the enormous Scoldrant, trapping it in an electrified cage.*

Scoldrant: *It tried to ram the cage, causing red strings of lightning to spark up its body.* "Florlar!"

Ethan: (Excellent-)

Brazza: *He sniffed in a cocky manner, lazily glancing at Vanguard and Pickles.* "Time to kill it!"

Ethan: (If anything unexpected happens, I'll use my Ougi, Subzero Volt and finish off the Scoldrant.)

Brazza: "Pour all your Neurons into these attacks!"

Pickles: "Harh!" *She quickly stood up and raised her arms, causing massive pillars of ice to erupt around the Scoldrant.* "Glacia's Edge."

Scoldrant: "Floar!" *It watched the lightning sparkle in the rising ice which froze around it.*

Vanguard: "Flaming Wheel." *She shouted at the top of her lungs and whirled her arms above her head, causing a swirl of flames to spiral along the ground.*

Scoldrant: *It looked down, watching the fire erupt into a tornado-like swirl around the ice.* "Floar!"

Brazza: "My turn." *He smirked, watching a swirl of water splash around it.*

Ethan: (By using the same magnitude of Neurons, instead of dousing out the fire or melting the ice into steam, it becomes water-)

Brazza: *He cracked his fingers and leant back, taking a deep breath.* "Electrifying Horror."

Vanguard: *She glanced behind her and jabbed forward, punching more waves of fire at whipping vines.* (This is what Ethan meant by re-spawning!-)

Brazza: "Now you're toast-" *He shouted out a scattered beam of lightning at the water, causing Ethan to gasp with a dropping jaw.*

Ethan: "No!"

Pickles: *She glanced behind her, watching Ethan flashstep in a curious manner.* "Wha-?"

Vanguard: *She avoided several vines and punched flames to each side, causing the vines to violently shake in response.* "Die already, dirty lamp-"

Ethan: *He stared at the scattered stream of lightning in slow motion as things blurred around him.* (No! No! No!-)

Brazza: *He smirked and gritted his teeth, watching the lightning stream from his mouth to the Scoldrant.* "Grone-"

Pickles: *She stared at the lightning, causing lights to flash off her face.* (Combo successful.)

Scoldrant: *The lightning mixed with the water, causing it to screech in a defeated manner.* "Floar!"

Vanguard: *She watched the vines' movement slow down, causing her to laugh victoriously.* "Jajajaja, now the commoners can harvest their fucking crops here again-"

Ethan: *He flashstepped in front of Brazza and kicked Pickles in the face, blasting her across the meadow.* "Streaming Sword." *He raised his arm and watched lightning swirl around it, allowing him to cut the stream of lightning from Brazza's mouth.*

Brazza: *He stepped back with a frown, glaring at Ethan.* "Why did you-?"

Ethan: "Thunder Boom." *He punched Brazza, blasting him back off his feet.*

Pickles: "Oof-" *She hit the ground and tumbled through the flowers, hitting a farm-like fence.*

Brazza: *He slid across the ground and red lightning swirled around his feet, causing him to instantly stop.* "I don't get it-?"

Ethan: *He smiled in sadness as strings of red lightning swirled up his feet, causing his body to violently twitch.* (Argh!)

Vanguard: "Jaaaaah?!" *She screamed in agonising pain as red lightning swirled up her feet.*

Brazza: *He gasped in shock and looked down, noticing a pool of water underneath Ethan and Vanguard.* "W-Water?"

Pickles: *She quickly leant up, alerted by Vanguard's screams, instantly noticing the lightning.* "What?!"

Scoldrant: "Flrrwor." *It fell and collapsed onto the ground, lying motionless.*

Vanguard: "Jarjarh-" *She awkwardly chuckled in a defeated manner, falling face-first into the water.*

Ethan: *He dropped to his knees and clicked his fingers, causing the lightning to instantly spark away in one flash.* (Now you won't have to worry about the Rasticsplash-)

Pickles: *She stood up and covered her mouth, realising what happened.* (The water! How did none of us realise that could've happened?!)

Brazza: *He noticed white orbs slowly float from Ethan's shoulders, causing him to flashstep over him.* "W-What happened!?"

Ethan: "Obvious, little brother."

Brazza: "You'll be fine, right? We get zapped all the time.. Right?"

Ethan: "The level of Neurons you poured into the lightning, and the water..." *He spoke softly as if the answer was obvious.*

Brazza: *He dropped to his knees, quickly holding Ethan in his arms.* "But, I was only trying to impress you-"

Ethan: "You were feeding your power, making it stronger, creating a wild animal."

Brazza: "Huh? I don't get it."

Ethan: "You need to tame the animal before releasing it."

Brazza: (Animal? Does he mean my lightning?)

Ethan: *He wheezed his words and touched his chest, frowning to himself.* (My heart has prematurely stopped?)

Brazza: "I'll take you back to the Consultant, and-?"

Ethan: "Stop it."

Brazza: "H-Huh?" *He looked overwhelmed, unsure what has happened.*

Pickles: *She looked at Vanguard, noticing her lying motionless in the grass.* "..."

Brazza: "I-I'm sorry.. I wasn't expecting this to happen? Your affinity is lightning too.. I.. I-..?"

Ethan: "I love you, my brother. I regret not being able to do more."

Pickles: (This is so sudden?! In a matter of seconds.. Vanguard, Ethan-)

Brazza: "Don't talk like that, brother-"

Ethan: "...-" *He suddenly burst into tiny white orbs and scattered before slowly swaying up in a petal-filled breeze.*

Brazza: "..." (My lightning-..?)

Pickles: *She slowly walked towards Brazza, glancing at Vanguard.* (I no longer feel her Neuron signature.)

Brazza: (My lightning did this? But, why?) *He mumbled in disbelief, registering what happened.*

Pickles: "Brazza...?"

Brazza: "This was my fault? Just like that.."

Pickles: "..." *She looked away, unsure what to say.*

Brazza: *He looked up with watering eyes, suddenly frowning in anger.* (Because I couldn't control it? No, because I was a reckless shit!)

Pickles: (Even if you don't know what to say-) *She walked up to Brazza and leant over him, wrapping her arms over his shoulders.* (Sometimes, just being there helps more than anything.)

Brazza: "I promise, I'll be more careful with my lightning."

Pickles: "..." *She closed her eyes, causing a sympathetic tear to run down her face.*

Brazza: "I swear it." *He raised his hand, noticing vein-like burns on his fingers.*

Pickles: (I still can't believe it... I thought this would've been an easy mission too.)

Brazza: "We.. Should head back."

Pickles: "A-Already?" *She sounded surprised as if she was expecting Brazza to take longer.*

Brazza: "Ethan told me all this time.. And, it took his death to make me realise." *He spoke in a deep, emotional tone, slowly standing up.*

Pickles: *She stepped away, watching Brazza wipe his tears away.* "Realise?"

Brazza: "What an idiot I was." *He turned around, slowly walking away.*

Pickles: "Not understanding isn't a choice." *She looked back to Vanguard, slowly following Brazza through the meadow.* "Being an idiot is."

Brazza: "Ha, shush." *He sniffed and flashstepped out of the meadow, causing a pulse of yellow petals to swirl around him.*

--

Lance: *He blinked in shock and looked at Alicia, noticing tears run down her face.* "Dude, Brenda got over the death of his brother pretty quickly, aye."

Alicia: *She shook her head, looking at Lance.* "No, he probably never got over that."

Lance: "Aye?" *He spoke in a caring manner, wiping the tears off Alicia's face.*

Alicia: "Remember what I said in AriAri village?"

Lance: "Umm-"

Alicia: "It's how the warriors are trained."

Lance: *He looked down to his hands, nodding his head in understanding.* "Alright.. I'm not that dumb to understand the meanin' behind that memory."

Alicia: "T-Tee hee." *She laughed, trying to brighten up the mood.*

Lance: *He leant forward, gently kissing Alicia on the lips.* "Thanks for watchin' it with me, aye."

Alicia: *She nodded her head in acknowledgement and raised her arms, placing her hands on his.* "HEALING RINGS"

Lance: (And, thanks, Brenda.. For showin' me your memory.)

Alicia: *She watched the light fade, cueing her to lower her arms in accomplishment.* "There."

Lance: *He noticed his hands and arms completely healed, causing him to kiss Alicia again.* "Thank you, beautiful."

Alicia: *She smiled with blushing cheeks, biting her bottom lip.* "We should go back to the city-"

*PKMY, Holland and Tyler walked out of the city, stepping on the aura path.*

Holland: "Hey, you two! Good news!"

Alicia: *She looked over her shoulder, staring at Holland.* "What are you three doing?"

PKMY: "We're heading towards the boat to smash the Consultant's face in!"

Lance: *He slowly and gently released Alicia, placing the crystal behind his back.* "A boat? Really?"

PKMY: "A boat? Really?" *She spoke in a stupid manner, walking on the ground.*

Lance: *The crystal warped and turned invisible, allowing him to lower his arms.* "So, we're goin' already?"

PKMY: *She stopped in front of Lance and Alicia, looking at him in confusion.* "Yea?"

Tyler: "What's with that response, Lance?"

Lance: "I figured we would be goin' to the research thingo and then discussin' wat we've got to do next."

Holland: *He scratched the back of his head, trying not to laugh.* (I actually thought that too, haha.)

Tyler: "We don't have the time." *He spoke in disappointment as if he wanted to discuss it.*

Alicia: "So, where is the ship?"

PKMY: "Don't know yet." *She shrugged her shoulders and leant to one side, placing a hand on her waist.*

*Season, Lezard, Cameron, Whitehead and several men walked out of the city, catching Holland's attention.*

Holland: "Looks like we will though."

Tyler: *He watched Season lead the party down the path, causing him to smile.* (Those Darkwings.. They were so scary.)

Lance: "So, wat's the go?" *He impatiently grunted, watching Season hobble up to the party.*

Season: "After several arrangements, we're finally ready to go."

Whitehead: "Off to my Sheridan!" *He pointed into the distance and started to march forward, causing his men to follow in a similar manner.*

Chapter 5: Mild Quest

Ridley: *His hair flapped to one side as he continued to concentrate on the warping air in front of him.* (I'm losing track of time, but by now the Darkwings should have infiltrated Silver Wind Island, or about to.)

*Ridley watched glyphs begin to materialise and form around the Spacial Funnel, causing him to smirk.*

Ridley: (Gabby... We're almost there.. Once I do this, I'll come back and find you..)

----------

*Arcadia and Celest stood on a floating island filled with beautiful white flowers, listening to the wind blowing in the distance.*

Celest: *She stood up straight, slowly walking towards Arcadia.* "Then why are you sad?"

Arcadia: "Thy'm sad.. My only friend, Celest." *Tears ran down her face, catching Celest's attention.*

Celest: *She looked over her shoulder and stared up into the sky, watching doves fly past a distant waterfall.* "Thy only came here to fully instate-"

Arcadia: "Why does it hurt so?" *She dropped to her knees, blowing a pulse of flowers around her.*

Celest: *She stopped admiring the flowers and focused all her attention to Arcadia.* "-Once you have finished everything The Wise has asked-"

Arcadia: "Thy saw many many things as an Astraseeker-" *She intensely stared at her hands with widening eyes.* "But, thy could not see the hatred she held towards me."

Celest: "Arcadia Forrier, please let go of your attachment-"

Arcadia: *She quickly looked up, frowning at Celest.* "Is this honestly the thanks thy receive?"

Celest: *She stared at the tears in Arcadia's eyes.* "I am having an issue trying to find Aliciana. Should someone with the abilities of an Astraseeker be able to assist me in such a task."

Arcadia: "Excuse me?"

Celest: "Perhaps we could form an unofficial contract?"

----------

Lance: *He looked at Whitehead in a strange manner, raising his eyebrow.* "Sheridan? Another person?"

*Lance glanced at Season, Tyler, Holland, Lezard, Cameron, PKMY and Alicia, counting them with his fingers in a childish manner.*

Lance: "No one's new here."

Lezard: "Oh, you silly sausage. Sheridan is Whitehead's-"

Lance: "Wut?"

PKMY: "Silly?"

Holland: "Sausage?"

Lance: "Silly sausage? Are you OK?"

Lezard: "I'm splendid, thankies."

Tyler: "Th-Thankies?"

Cameron: "Leave his unusual choice of wordings alone."

Season: "I agree."

Whitehead: "Sheridan is my dear companion."

Lance: "Wateva." *He grunted to himself as if he no longer cared.*

Season: "So, Whitehead.. Where is the vessel?"

Whitehead: "I had to keep her on the outskirts of The Swirling Marshes."

Lance: "Swirlin' wat?"

Cameron: "Swirling Marshes by foot, it is a fair while."

Lance: "How long is a fair while?"

Lezard: "We've got to pass The Lost City, then Sakura Village, and then The Swirling Marshes."

Whitehead: "It would be wise to travel along the coast until we see her, argh."

PKMY: *She shook her head in an annoyed manner.* "Why did you leave it so far away?"

Whitehead: "So other guild members don't try and steal her away." *He looked at PKMY like she was an idiot.*

Tyler: "So, we're up for a long walk."

Lance: *He had a flashback of Millard sarcastically saying the same thing.* (This is just like those Unknown Territories again.) *He sighed and rolled his eyes.*

Lezard: "The party started to walk towards the forest in the distance, keeping close to the coast-"

Lance: "That is so lame, who does that." *He grunted at Lezard like a child, causing Alicia to discreetly giggle.*

Holland: "So, why are you travelling with us, Lezard?" *He mumbled in curiosity, listening to the waves crash with heightened hearing.*

PKMY: "Yea, don't you travel with Rachael?"

Lezard: "I-Is Lezard not wanted?" *He spoke in a soft, hurt manner, causing Holland to guiltily shake his head.*

Holland: "No, I didn't mean it like-"

Lezard: "Bwarharh, well.. If you really want to know-" *He spoke in a serious manner, catching PKMY's attention.*

PKMY: (His constant cheery personality slowly faded-)

Lezard: "I can't forgive the Consultant for what he did."

*Whitehead and his men walked in front, chattering amongst themselves about preparations to the ship.*

Season: "What did the Consultant do?"

Lezard: "Forgive me, but I just don't feel comfortable telling you."

Season: "That's fine."

PKMY: "Hey, Lizard."

Lezard: "Where?" *He coughed and reverted back to his cheery self.*

PKMY: "Thanks for healing us back in The Twilight Forest."

Lezard: "Oh?" *He spoke in a sarcastic and curious manner.*

PKMY: "I don't think I thanked you for that."

Lezard: *He continued to walk along the cliff, watching the waves move in the ocean.* "I appreciate your appreciation."

PKMY: "R-Right." *She nervously grunted, looking away in an awkward manner.*

Tyler: *He walked past several trees, happily stroking the strap to the RPG bag.* "This is great."

Holland: "What is?"

Tyler: "Us, all walking together." *He looked at Holland with a widening smile.*

Season: "Hohoho, I don't believe we've had this opportunity, Tyler."

Tyler: "No, so I'm a little excited."

Alicia: "Tee hee, I agree!"

Lance: "Nobody asked for your opinion, grottom bottom."

PKMY: "Nor did any to you, shit face."

Lezard: "Ouchies."

Lance: "Wateva."

Alicia: *She cupped her pendant, smiling in thought.* (This reminds of when it was me, Lance, Ashton and Teresa-)

Lezard: *He noticed Alicia's pendant, causing him to sarcastically shake his bottom in excitement.* "What a beautiful pendant-"

Lance: "Oi, she's taken, dude."

Lezard: "Ooo, young love! How touching." *He cupped his hands near his face, squirming in happiness.*

Alicia: *She smiled at Lance and ran her fingers along the pendant, looking at Lezard.* "It was a gift, given to me by my parents."

Lezard: "It's blue with an orange shading? What is it made out of?"

Alicia: "It's a moonstone coloured opal."

Lezard: "Beautiful." *He smiled and shook his head, causing the bangles to sway from his hat.*

Season: "So, Tyler, what was that technique you used?" *He spoke in amazement, triggering a flashback of Tyler using his handguns.*

Tyler: "Wow." *He gasped, staring at Season in a surprised manner.*

Lance: "You used the wow technique?"

PKMY: "Heh."

Season: "Hmm?" *He raised an eyebrow with a slight smirk.*

Tyler: "N-No, it's just, you sounded amazed."

Cameron: (That must have been the technique he used when I fell unconscious.) *He had flashbacks of slicing his sword across Dakota's arm.*

Lance: "Well, I admit, it was pretty epic." *He sniffed his finger, placing his hands on the back of his head.*

Tyler: "It's called Ragnarok."

Alicia: "Was that the same thing when we all used our Ougi?"

Lance: (Oh, I remember that-) "But, you did nothin'?"

Tyler: "Yes, nothing happened because Ragnarok is something that needs to be created."

Lance: "Ah." *He nodded his head, full of confusion.*

Alicia: "When did you create something so powerful?"

Season: "And what kind of weapon was that? I've never seen a long-range weapon like that before."

Lance: "They're called pistols, we have them back from where I'm from. I rekon they're kool."

Tyler: "I personally reckon they're cheap and lousy, but they were the best weapon I could practically use without any skill." *He looked at Alicia.* "I created it in my spare time, using Silver Wind Island's resources."

Cameron: "And where are you from?"

Lance: "Wait, who's the guy in the warrior's outfit?" *He gave Cameron an unfamiliar look.*

Season: *He looked shocked.* "Haven't I introduced you?!" *He sounded annoyed at himself.*

Cameron: "My name is Cameron." *He spoke in a professional manner, glancing at each party member.*

Season: "This is Holland-"

Holland: "Hey."

Season: "Tyler."

Tyler: "H-Hello."

Season: "Alicia."

Alicia: "N-Nice to meet you."

Season: "Lezard."

Lezard: "A lovely day, isn't it?" *He looked above the treetops, carefully stepping over tree roots.*

Season: "PKMY."

PKMY: "Don't be annoying and we can be friends."

Season: "And-"

Lance: "Lance, don't be annoyin' and we can be bestest buddies-"

PKMY: "Shut it, try hard." *She punched Lance on the shoulder, causing him to poke his tongue out at her.*

Lezard: *He observed PKMY and Lance's interaction.* (Their bond seems really strong, just like our guild.)

Holland: "So, Cameron, I sense you're a Scoldrant User?"

Cameron: "Indeed I am. And you two are as well?" *He glanced at PKMY and Holland.*

Holland: "I am, but she's not."

Cameron: "You are not?"

PKMY: "Umm, no, why?"

Cameron: "Hmm? When you used your technique to defeat the first large creature, I sensed your Soul Link."

Lance: "Soul Link?"

Season: "The connection between Scoldrants and their partners."

Lance: "Oh, yea."

PKMY: "Eh?"

Holland: "No wait, I think I felt it too."

PKMY: "Maybe it was just my empathic abilities?"

Cameron: "Well, it is not possible for you to achieve a Soul Link.. So that is probably the best explanation."

Lance: "Aye? How come?"

Holland: "Because Soul Links are bloodline abilities."

Lance: "Bah-" *He groaned with acknowledgement.*

Alicia: "Cameron, I noticed your warrior's armour is actually that of a captain's."

Cameron: *He looked down, nodding his head.* "My ranking was that of-"

Lance: "Number three."

Lezard: "Ooo! Lezard says, number five."

Apollo: (Why does he guess wrong?)

Cameron: *He glanced at Lezard.* (Irrelevant-)

PKMY: "I say number two?"

Cameron: "One."

Lance: *His childish smirk faded.* "Number one?"

Cameron: "Are you partially deaf?"

PKMY: "Heh, I like this guy."

Lance: "Oh, wateva." *He waved his hands as if he didn't care.*

Tyler: "If you think my Ougi was awesome, what about that lightning you used."

Lezard: *He glanced at Tyler as he focused in and out of the conversation.* (That Dragon's Breath he used in the city?)

Holland: "Man, that was really awesome."

PKMY: "Yea-" *She nodded her head in agreement.* "Those ice claymores, they were impressive."

Lance: "Impressive?" *He looked at Alicia as if he wasn't expecting a compliment from PKMY.*

Alicia: "Tee hee."

Season: "Even though we've all become much stronger-" *He glanced across the party in a worried manner.* "Didn't that exhaust a lot of your Neurons and Astragons?"

Lance: "Newgongs 'n' Astragongs.. Let's not throw out the nerdy talk already, we're meant to do that near our destination." *He looked at Season, sighing in a serious manner.* "But, yeah.. I got really tired. What about you, quick fingers?"

Lezard: "Bwarharh."

PKMY: "Heh." *She smirked, causing Holland to chuckle.*

Tyler: "..."

Holland: *He placed his hand on Tyler's shoulder, smiling in a proud manner.* "Well?"

Tyler: "No, I'm fine. The only thing that needs to rest are the weapons themselves."

Season: *He nodded his head.* "It's really unique. When we have more time, I'd like to take a closer look, if that's fine?"

Tyler: "Yeah, sure!" *He smiled, resting one arm over the RPG bag to stop it from moving.*

Lezard: "What kind of abilities do you all possess?"

Lance: "Abilities?" *He grunted.*

Lezard: "Lezard knows Tyler is a researcher, Holland is a Scoldrant User, PKMY is scary-"

PKMY: "Wat?!"

Lezard: "Bwarharh, I'm joking, my sensational lady."

Holland: "Your lady?" *He smirked with slight jealousy.*

Lance: "And what are you, aye?"

Lezard: "I'm a healer." *He proudly announced, playing with his cone-shaped hat.*

PKMY: "You have Radiatons?"

Lezard: "Yuppers."

Alicia: *She walked into a small clearing and sunlight shined off her sun-shaped pendant.* (I never met anyone who could heal outside Valhalla naturally.)

Lance: *He picked his nose in satisfaction and yawned, placing his hands back behind his head.* (I know I've become stronger, but I can't shake that fear feelin' the Consultant gives me-)

Alicia: "What are you thinking about, Lance?"

Lance: "Oh, nothin' important?"

PKMY: "Well, I'm worrying about the Consultant." *She discreetly smirked at Lance.*

Holland: "Yeah, that's been on my mind too."

Cameron: *He moved his arm, watching the light shimmer on his armour.* "The Consultant is said to be very powerful. I have never engaged in combat with him, nor seen him at his fullest."

Season: "After a long and strenuous time-" *He glanced at the party and paused, emphasising his seriousness.* "We're very close to confronting the Consultant. It's only natural for our nerves to be heightened."

Alicia: "What about you, Season?"

Season: "I'm scared."

Tyler: "R-Really?" *He sounded surprised.*

Season: "If you don't experience fear, then you don't know what is dangerous."

Holland: "But fear is just the unknown-"

Season: "Although that is true, fear, like all emotions are vital. If we weren't feeling fear, we'd all confront the Con-" *He paused.* "Ridley, and strike with full force without giving two thoughts on a strategy."

Cameron: "I have witnessed that very thing several times with inexperienced warriors."

PKMY: *She nodded her head.* "So have I."

Alicia: *She looked at PKMY then to Cameron, then looking back to PKMY in confusion.* "What do you mean?"

Season: (Really? You're going to officially announce it?)

PKMY: (Yeah, why not?)

Tyler: "PKMY?"

PKMY: "I also used to be a warrior."

Cameron: "Hmm?" *He sounded intrigued, glancing at PKMY in a curious manner.*
Lance: "Aye?!"

Alicia: "First, Teresa and now PKMY."

Lance: "So, who else was? Tyler?"

Tyler: "W-What? Me?"

Lance: "Pssht, relax, I was jokin'."

Alicia: "What ranking were you?"

PKMY: "Ah, I was number two."

Holland: "Nice." *He mumbled to himself.*

Lance: (You know, by now, I don't really care-)

Lezard: "What did you do when you were a warrior?"

PKMY: *She paused, looking down to the ground.* "I feel comfortable revealing that to you, but that's as far as I want to go."

Lance: *He nodded his head, grunting in acceptance.* "That's fine by me, aye." *He rudely glanced at the party, implying they shouldn't care.*

Lezard: *He smiled and held his hat, nodding his head.* "That's fine by me, child."

Tyler: (PKMY a warrior?) *He mumbled to himself, triggering a flashback.*

--

PKMY: "Why have you stopped attacking-?"

Twortz: "For a number two, you're not very impressive."

PKMY: "Tssk." *She frowned, giving Twortz evil-like looks.*

Twortz: *She sighed, spreading her legs.* "At least you weren't a mindless, blood hungry, animal, I've encountered through my journeys."

PKMY: "..."

Twortz: "And, I haven't stopped attacking. Even at my ranking, I'm unable to use these techniques at the same time without suffering the risk of Neuron damage."

PKMY: "W-Wat-?"

Twortz: "Ougi."

Tyler: *He gasped, ignoring strings of blood which ran down his face from his ears.* "Twortz, don't!"

--

Tyler: (I almost forgot about that..-)

Season: *He looked at each party member, stroking his chin in a curious manner.* "I have many questions to ask."

Holland: "Like?"

Season: "What have you all done after we split ways?"

Alicia: "When we split ways?"

Season: "For instance-" *He quickly hugged Alicia, tightly squeezing her with a smile.*

Alicia: "H-Huh?"

Season: "It's great to have you back?!"

Alicia: *She looked shocked, hugging Season in confusion.* "Th-Thank you."

Season: *He stepped back, shaking his head.* "How?"

Holland: *He looked interested as if he wanted to know too.* "..."

Lance: "I'm not good with stories, but we revived her with Madora's help."

Lezard: "Revived? This sounds interesting."

Cameron: "Reviving an entity after they have passed into The Astral Plains is not possible."

Lance: *He shrugged his shoulder, looking away.* "Storytime ain't my thing."

Lezard: "Awh." *He pretended to be upset, sarcastically wiping under his eyes.*

Tyler: (Maybe I should explain what happened?) *He thought with hesitation.*

PKMY: *She glanced at Tyler and looked at Alicia in a caring manner.* (You don't mind?)

Alicia: (No, it's fine.)

PKMY: "Well, Lance, Chrisma, Madora and I went to the place where Alicia sealed the last glyph."

Tyler: "H-Huh?" *He gasped in shock, staring at PKMY with widening eyes.* (I was going to say that!-)

Season: "Was this before or after the fight?" *He looked at Tyler and PKMY, unsure who was going to answer him.*

Tyler: "Fight? I don't-"

PKMY: "Before."

----------

*A ray of white light blasted down from the sky and hit the ground, allowing Cassidy to step out of it.*

Cassidy: *He waved particles of light out of his face, observing a jungle-like environment.* "Where-?"

Lorilei: *She appeared in a flash of purple light with her back facing Cassidy, looking to each side in a cautious manner.* (This is where the energy signature was-)

Cassidy: "Lorilei."

Lorilei: "Oh?" *She turned around startled and smiled.* "You made it before me."

Cassidy: *He nodded his head.* "Where are we?"

Lorilei: "Considering how my senses are currently messed up, I'd presume inside a Spacial Funnel."

Cassidy: "I'm not good at sensing, but it's obvious where that massive energy signature is coming from."

Lorilei: "Indeed. I can feel it too." *She spoke in a high tone of voice and looked ahead, staring at vines and ferns.*

Cassidy: "Well, I don't want to let down the Valkyrie."

Lorilei: "Yes."

*Lorilei looked over her shoulder, focusing her attention on her wings.*

Lorilei: "These might get in the way-" *She flapped her wings, watching them warp and fade into nothing.*

Cassidy: "You're right-" *He flapped his wings, causing them to warp and fade away.* "I'll lead, and you cover me with your Remenistal?"

Lorilei: "Of course." *She nodded her head and faced Cassidy, watching him lead the way.*

Cassidy: "Alright, phase one completed, mistress." *He prayed to himself, keeping his morale up high.*

----------

Locki: *He squinted his eyes, watching the area swirl and blur around him.* (Where is she?)

*Locki's hair and cape flapped in a circular motion, listening to winds whoosh as if they were outside.*

Locki: (I can't track her Neuron signature... Despite her superior ability to dwindle and hide her power, her Radiatons have always been noticeable to me-)

*The area reverted back to normal and Locki found himself on a floating island.*

Locki: (For you, mistress... Valkyrie.. I will not give up until I succeed in the task you've given me!-)

*Locki sighed and clapped his hands, causing the area to swirl and blur around him.*

Locki: (Focus on her location!)

----------

PKMY: "And that's what happened."

Tyler: "Yeah." *He nodded his head as if he was supporting PKMY's story.*

Season: (So, Felix turned out to be good after all.)

Cameron: (Tampering with life forces, she must be very powerful.) *He thought in confusion, triggering a flashback of Madora's handicapped-like behaviour in the research facility.*

PKMY: "If I don't mess up the timeline, this would've happened just before Tarlea made her presence known."

Season: "Hmm." *He nodded his head.*

Lezard: "Lezard finds it romantic how Lance was going to give his life so eagerly."

Lance: "Eagerly? Pssht, nah. I, err-" *He paused in thought, looking away with blushing cheeks.*

Tyler: (He's got nothing.) *He smiled.*

Holland: "I'm not surprised at all."

Lance: "For the last time-"

PKMY: "Wateva."
Tyler, Season: "Whatever."
Holland: "Whatever!"

Lance: *His face grew redder, due to embarrassment.* "W-Wateva." *He quietly grumbled to himself, pouting his lips like a child.*

Alicia: "Tee hee."

Lance: "You're all, dirty shit nuggets, and that's that!" *He raised his nose, folding his arms like a child.*

Lezard: "Dirty shit nuggets? Oh dear, go to the bathroom, everyone!" *He shook his bottom in a sarcastic manner.*

Cameron: "Hmm?" *He looked past the party and into the distance.*

PKMY: (I can't believe I'm friends with these people-) *She grunted to herself in thought, shaking her head.*

Holland: *He suddenly looked into the distance in confusion.* "Wha-?"

Cameron: "Do you sense it too?"

Holland: "I think so."

Season: *He glanced at Holland and Cameron.* "Speak of it."

Holland: "I sense Scoldrants."

Lance: "Pssht, so?"

Season: "I agree, what's the urgency?"

Cameron: "Due to past experiences, I believe they suffer from the yellow-eyed condition."

Tyler: "I know they are violent, but we d-don't have time to-"

Cameron: "If Whitehead's method is to stay along the coast, then we will have to confront them."

Tyler: *He nervously gulped, tightly holding the strap to his RPG bag.* "I-I see."

Whitehead: "Make sure you fill her up with the energy stones I gave you."

Man: "Y-Yes, boss-"

Whitehead: "We're nearly halfway, argh." *He yelled out to the party over his shoulder.*

Lance: "Only half?" *He dropped his shoulders and sighed.*

Tyler: "Halfway, thank you." *He yelled out as if he was working in Fast Food Enterprise.*

Lance: (What a loser.)

Alicia: *She held onto her pendant.* (By next sunrise-) *She tightened her grip with anxiety.* (Is the day we'll confront Ridley.)

Season: "Cameron or Holland, how far are these Scoldrants?"

Holland: *The purple ring around his iris spiralled, causing his vision to change perspective.* "I'm-" *He paused, squinting his eyes with uncertainty.*

Cameron: "Not sure?"

Holland: "Yeah?"

Cameron: "Whatever that pulse did with the teleporting, it has also affected my sense of distance."

Lezard: "Oh, no."

PKMY: "Then, what are we going to do?"

Season: "This could be troubling."

Cameron: "It is fine-" *He closed his eyes and Apollo suddenly flew out of a grey glyph which instantly appeared in the air.*

Apollo: "Sqwuark." *He flapped his wings and flew above the treetops, causing Whitehead's men to lower their heads in shock.*

Season: "The Scoldrant is an ally! Don't fret!" *His shout caused the men to slowly regain their composure.*

Cameron: "You know what to do." *He looked up, whispering under his breath.*

Apollo: (Yes.)

Holland: (Freya, help him out-) *He placed his hands on his tribal markings and chest.* (Alright?) *He punched both arms out, causing a purple glyph to spiral in front of him.*

Freya: *She flew out of the glyph and flapped her wings above the treetops.* (Yes.)

Season: "What a splendid idea." *He watched Apollo and Freya fly out of his sight.*

Tyler: "I think we should let Whitehead know about the Scoldrants."

Alicia: *She nodded her head in agreement, looking ahead to the men.* "It would be bad if they weren't expecting the Scoldrants."

Lance: "Good idea." *He stared at Tyler, nudging his head towards the men.* "Go on then."

Tyler: "B-But, umm." *He nervously looked around as if he didn't want to.*

Holland: "I'll tell him."

Tyler: "R-Right."

Lance: *He watched Holland walk past him and towards Whitehead, causing him to roll his eyes.* (This is so borin'.)

Season: "So, Lance, would you like to explain how you learnt to use your lightning as a sword?"

Lance: "Oh, umm, yea." *He sighed, preparing himself to explain the story to the party.* "Well, it was this seal and The Voice of On, right."

Lezard: "Ooo, another story." *He giggled sarcastic, wiggling his bottom.*

Cameron: (The Voice of On?) *He looked confused as he closely listened to Lance's story.*

----------

Locki: *He closed his eyes, frowning in complete concentration.* (Where is she?) *The sounds of echoing wind whooshed from the swirling area around him.* (Where are you?!)

*Locki's robes flapped in a circular motion, as the area continued to swirl around him.*

Locki: (There!) *He opened his eyes with success and he looked up in determination.*

*Locki watched the area grow dark around him, noticing the air slowly stop its swirling motion.*

Locki: (She was this close to the path?)

*Sounds of water dripping echoed in the cave and Locki's image suddenly appeared in a flash of white light.*

Locki: *He looked around the cave in curiosity and stepped forward, causing water to splash around his feet.* "Water?"

*Locki looked down and noticed he stood in a pool of Teresa's blood, causing his eyes to widen.*

Locki: "Terra and-?" *He waved his arm over Jewel as if he was scanning her with his hand.* "Jewel-"

*Locki quickly stood over Teresa and bent down, touching her cheek.*

Locki: (She's cold-) "HEALING RINGS" *White rings spiralled under Teresa and Jewel, lighting up the entire section of the cave.*

----------

Celest: "Even in your current state, this is remarkably detailed." *She found herself in Arcadia's room.*

Arcadia: "Thy do not seek compliments filled with pity, preparations are almost complete."

Celest: *She sat down on a stylish wooden chair and stared at Arcadia.* "Do you need any more requirements?"

Arcadia: "Only when the sun sets."

Celest: "Why then?"

Arcadia: "What thou ask.. If she is awake.. It's dangerous if thy do it otherwise."

Celest: "That is understandable."

Arcadia: *She stared at Celest with her hazel and red eyes.* "Is there anything else?"

Celest: "No. If thy haven't made myself clear, thy wish to be a part of it."

Arcadia: "Of course." *She tilted her head in respect.*

----------

Season: "Very interesting, Lance."

Lance: "Yea, and ever since, I can feel the lightnin'."

Tyler: "From what we heard, I think Dakota was the scariest."

Cameron: (Perhaps the Consultant has given up on the warrior system? Using his last resort with captains of my power in ranking-)

Lezard: "Ooo, my legs hurt." *He whined, pretending to cry.*

Holland: *He walked up to the party, scratching the back of his head.* "I told Whitehead about the Scoldrants-"

?????: "Skree." *Its screech echoed in the distance, catching the party's attention.*

Lance: "Skree? Did ya say somethin', Alicia?"

Alicia: "Tee.. Hee." *She rolled her eyes.*

Lance: "Jokes-" *He sounded playful and stepped to the side, looking past several pine-like trees.* "It came from over there."

PKMY: "Away from the shore."

Holland: "Cameron, I can't really sense them-"

Cameron: "There is only one, and it is heading directly for us."

Tyler: "O-Oh."

Lezard: "What are we to do, goodness me?"

PKMY: *She glanced at the party, half smirking at Lezard and Tyler.* "You've got nothing to worry about."

Lance: "I rekon."

Season: "Just keep in mind, I don't want us to use any powerful techniques-"

Lance: "Oh, wat? Why?!"

Cameron: "To ensure we are at maximum capacity whilst we fight the Consultant."

Season: "Exactly-"

Darkwing: *Branches whipped past its skull as it sprinted through the trees on all fours.* "Skree!-" *It jumped off a tree stump and glided through the air towards the party.*

PKMY: "There it is!-"

Lance: "No shit-"

Season: "Everyone, teamwork!"

Darkwing: *It landed heavily on the ground and tried to step forward.* "Sk-?" *It looked down, pulling its arms out of the dirt.* "Skree."

Holland: "Got it!" *He ran towards the Darkwing and raised his fists, stepping into striking distance.*

Darkwing: "Skr-"

Holland: "Harh!" *He punched across the Darkwing's skull to the right.*

Darkwing: "Skree!-" *It rocked to the right as swirls of shadow pulsed away from Holland's fist.*

Holland: "Hmph-" *He leant forward, punching the Darkwing to the left.*

Darkwing: *Its bone cracked as it awkwardly stepped to the left.* "Sk-Sk-"

Holland: *He leant back and raised his fist to the side of his head.* "Harh!" *He punched with his shoulder forward, causing him to lift one leg back.*

Darkwing: *Its bones snapped and it stumbled back, due to the force of Holland's punch.* "Skree-" *Fire swirled around it, causing it to look at its feet in confusion.*

Holland: (This one is stronger than the ones that were in the city.)

Tyler: "Ougi-"

Holland: *He quickly shuffled back, nodding his head.* "Go!"

PKMY: "FLAMING WHEEL" *The flames erupted and blasted the Darkwing into the air.* "Heh-" *She smirked and leant to one side in a confident manner.*

Darkwing: *Glass-like sounds caused it to look up and it noticed spears of ice forming themselves in the air.* "Skrii-?" *It screeched at the ice spears as the fire flapped around its legs.*

Lance: *He puffed out his chest and flicked his arm, causing lightning to swirl and form a sword.* (I'm ready-)

Alicia: "ICICLE EDGE" *She swayed her arms down, blasting the spears of ice into the Darkwing.*

Tyler: *White liquid swirled from the RPG bag and around his hands.* "Ragnarok!"

*The liquid formed into two handguns and Tyler aimed them into the air.*

Tyler: "I can do this!" *He pulled the triggers, shooting several fluoro green bullets into the Darkwing.*

Darkwing: "Skargh!" *Its bones cracked due to the bullets, watching small streams of green mist-like residue sway from the holes.*

Whitehead: (Amazing teamwork-) *He watched the fire swirl around the Darkwing's legs, causing mist to evaporate off the ice spears which was embedded in its chest.*

Lance: "Right!-" *He flashstepped, causing dirt to swirl around where he stood.*

Cameron: "Humph-" *Sparks scattered around his sword and his image disappeared.*

Darkwing: *It squinted its eyes and scanned the party for a target, ignoring its damaged body.* "Skra?!"

Tyler: *He aimed one of the handguns at the Darkwing's skull, hesitating in thought.* (Despite what we've done to it, it's still fixated on getting us-)

Darkwing: *It focused on Lezard, causing it to screech with killing intent.* "Sk-"

Lezard: "Eww, I'm not interested!"

*Lance and Cameron appeared on both sides of the Darkwing.*

Darkwing: *It glanced to its sides in shock.* "Sk-?"

*Lance and Cameron swayed their arms, slicing each of the Darkwing's arms off.*

Lezard: "Ooo, jolly goodness." *He watched Lance and Cameron land on the ground.* "They sliced off the creature's arms like it was butter on a delicious sandwich!"

PKMY: "Wat?!" *She looked to her side at Lezard, giving him an annoyed grunt.*

Lezard: "Umm.." *He avoided eye contact, watching the tornado-like swirl of fire die down.*

Season: "Powers of the proud brown, beat and skip through the winds, GRAVEL'S PULSE"

*A ring a small of rocks materialised in the air and spiralled around Season's hand.*

Season: "My Rostical, here!-" *He pushed his arm forward and the rocks appeared directly in front of the descending Darkwing.*

Darkwing: "Sk-" *The rocks crumbled to dust and burst in its face, causing its skull to crack.*

Tyler: *He watched the Darkwing hit the ground disorientated, causing him to bend down on one knee.* "Look at this-"

*The handguns shined white and moved like liquid, catching Lance's attention.*

Tyler: (It's hard to concentrate-) *The liquid started to take shape and its light dimmed, as a bazooka formed over his shoulder.*

Lance: "Whoa!" *He chuckled in disbelief as he stared at the bazooka.*

Alicia: "What is that?" *She spoke under her breath, causing PKMY to shrug her shoulders.*

Tyler: *He glanced at Cameron and Lance, who stood behind the Darkwing.* "You two, please get out of the w-way."

*The bazooka charged itself up, cueing Tyler to aim it towards the Darkwing.*

Cameron: "Yes-" *He flashstepped next to Holland out of Tyler's way.*

Lance: "Wateva-" *He flashstepped behind Tyler, allowing him to further inspect the bazooka.* (It sounds like a laser chargin' up or something-)

Tyler: "Taste crafting!" *A fluoro green ball shot out of the bazooka and slammed into the Darkwing, causing it to explode backwards.*

Season: *He watched a rippled shadow of dust vaporise into the air.* "Nicely done, Tyler!"

Lance: "Freakin' sweet!"

Tyler: "A-Alright-" *He sighed in relief and lowered the bazooka, watching it disintegrate into nothing.* "Let's continue?" *He stood up, looking at the party with an innocent face.*

Season: "Yes, let's." *He started to shuffle towards Whitehead which prompted the party to follow.*

Whitehead: *He looked impressed, focusing his attention back in front.* "Move it, men! Argh."

Alicia: "That was amazing, Tyler." *She cupped her hands in amazement.*

PKMY: "Yea, it was awesome." *She grunted with a smirk.*

Holland: "It was great!" *He chuckled, scratching behind his head.*

Cameron: "It was unique and somewhat impressive." *He spoke in a professional manner with his eyes closed.*

Lezard: "Holy fish-cakes! It was sensational." *He sarcastically wobbled his bottom.*

Tyler: *He smiled with blushing cheeks, looking down in a modest manner.* "Th-Thank you, everyone."

Lance: *He looked at the party then to Tyler.* "Yea, well, remember my big lightning? That was kool too!"

PKMY: "..." *She silently walked past Lance and ignored him, closely following the party.*

Lance: *He stood on the spot in confusion, waving his arms in a childish manner.* "Wasn't it kool?!"

*Lance yelled at the party and watched them walk past several trees, causing him to jog after them.*

Lance: "Oi! Wait for me!"

----------

Locki: *He intensely stared at Teresa, ignoring clusters of mist-like light waft past his face.* (Her body is still cold, and still isn't reacting to the Radiatons-)

*The light slightly dimmed as Locki sighed in slight fatigue.*

Locki: (Not even her companion has responded to the light. Then, I'll need to use something more drastic-) "Power of Radiatons-"

*Locki spread his arms over Teresa and a white glyph formed under his feet.*

Locki: "Strongest healing revitalise my brethren, PHOENIX TRANQUILLITY"

----------

*Season, PKMY, Holland, Alicia, Lance, Tyler, Lezard and Cameron followed Whitehead and his crew through the forest, filled with differently coloured mushrooms.*

Alicia: "W-Wow-" *She stopped walking with the party and stepped to the side, observing one of the mushrooms.*

Tyler: *He scanned further down the path and noticed larger mushrooms.* "There's some human-sized ones over there." *He looked at Alicia and pointed down the path.*

Lance: "Man, simple things get you two excited."

PKMY: "Heh-" *She chuckled in agreement.* "She does like you though."

Lance: "Aha, oi!"

Alicia: *She reached forward to touch the mushrooms.* "Umm-"

Tyler: "I hope they're not poisonous."

Alicia: "Eek-?" *She quickly leant back in a cautious manner, looking over her shoulder to the party.*

Holland: "No, these are harmless. These are actually used for celebratory purposes."

Lezard: *He inspected the mushrooms, adjusting his cone-shaped hat.* "Because of the twinkles it does?"

Lance: "Twinkles?"

PKMY: "It does?"

Holland: *He nodded his head.* "Alicia, hit the mushroom."

Alicia: "Ah?" *She paused in hesitation, looking back to the mushroom.*

Cameron: "It is fine."

Alicia: "Umm-" *She prepared herself and hit the mushroom, causing a puff of sparkling spores to glitter around her.* "Wow-"

Tyler: "Cool." *He chuckled as he admired the glittering spores.*

Season: *He noticed Whitehead and his men walking out of sight.* "We have plenty of time to admire the flora, but-"

Lance: "Yea, yea." *He grunted as if he knew what Season was going to say.*

Alicia: "Okay, sorry." *She shook her head and skipped next to Season, causing the party to continue walking.*

Lezard: "Sounds of crashing waves echoed in the background and insects buzzed in nearby trees."

PKMY: "Face palm."

Lance: "Huh?"

PKMY: "I figured if we're saying everything, I can too?"

Lance: "But, you ain't face palmin'-?"

PKMY: *She slapped Lance on the forehead, causing her to walk past him with an evil-like grin.* "Heh."

Lance: *He grunted, rubbing his forehead in frustration.* "Wateva!" *He brushed past PKMY and ran ahead of the party, jogging after Whitehead and his men.*

Cameron: "Hmm?" *He suddenly stopped and looked to his side, waiting with anticipation.*

Lezard: "Everything okay, my dear boy?"

*Freya and Apollo flew past the treetops and dived down behind the party, alerting Holland.*

Holland: *He turned around in confusion.* "What is it?"

Freya: (The Scoldrants are up ahead in the next clearing.)

PKMY: "Really?" *She looked at Freya in shock.*

Tyler: "Really, what?"

PKMY: (Only up in the next clearing?) *She looked down the path and stepped forward, flashstepping out of the area.* (Lance and the fools have already left our sight-)

Holland: *He glanced at the party, confirming Freya and Apollo's findings.* "The Scoldrants are up ahead."

Season: *He became alert.* "Then let's move forward!"

Lance: *He ran into a clearing and noticed Whitehead and his men lying on the ground unconscious.* "Wat-?"

*Lance stepped forward and noticed green, snot-like jelly covering the ground around them.*

Lance: *He raised an eyebrow in disgust, staring at the jelly which strung near the slopes and ditches in the clearing.* "Someone needs a tissue, aye-"

*Snail-like Scoldrants squirmed from behind several trees, catching Lance's attention.*

Lance: "Aye?" *He pointed at the snail-like Scoldrants with a blank look.* "Arh hahaha! What are you goin' to do? Squirm towards me to death?!"

Scoldrant: *Its eyes glowed yellow and it slowly pushed itself towards Lance.* "Qwehqweh."

Lance: *He casually walked towards the four Scoldrants, shaking his head in disbelief.* "So, I like, I don't even have the urge to hurt you."

Scoldrant: "Queshweh."

Lance: *He walked up to one of the Scoldrants which attempted to charge for him.* "It's a nice day, ain't it?" *He placed his elbow on the Scoldrant's shell, watching the leaves sway in the wind.*

PKMY: *She flashstepped into the clearing and noticed Lance casually talking to the Scoldrants.* (Is he mad?!)

*Season, Tyler, Cameron, and Holland ran behind PKMY into the clearing.*

Cameron: *He instantly noticed the Scoldrants and gasped.* "What are they doing here?"

Holland: "L-Lance?" *He gasped in disbelief, trying not to make any sudden movements.*

*Lezard and Alicia ran up to the party and noticed Lance acting like a child near the Scoldrants.*

Lance: "Oh, yea?" *He wiped his bottom on the Scoldrant's shell, making clean, wipe-like noises.*

Lezard: "H-He's brave!" *He gasped under his breath and grabbed the cone-shaped hat with both hands, pulling it down in a worried manner.*

Alicia: "Why?"

Tyler: "Yeah, they seem like harmless Scoldrants."

Lezard: "Never judge a cake by its icing!"

Lance: *He looked around and noticed the party staring at him in shock.* "Oh, I found the Scoldrant thingys." *He knocked on the shell like a door, grinning like a child.* "Sounds like wood-"

Holland: "Lance, get away from them." *He spoke calmly with a tone of urgency.*

Cameron: *He bent down and touched the snot-like jelly, rubbing it in between his fingers.* "To compensate for their lack of speed."

Holland: "They devised a powerful anaesthetic!"

Lance: "Ana- wat wat?" *He stared at Holland then to Whitehead and his men.* "Oh, crap-" *He spoke in realisation and stepped back, straightening his arm at a nearby Scoldrant.*

Cameron: "And they also have a special ability in their natural slime-"

Lance: "LIGHTNING BLAST" *A stream of lightning blasted into the Scoldrant's shell.* "There's no way you can catch me-"

Scoldrant: "Qweh qweh." *The lightning's stream broke and spiralled into its shell.*

Cameron: "They are able to fluctuate the Astragons and absorb the Neurons-"

Lance: "W-Wat-?" *He stepped back in shock.*

PKMY: "Flashstep away, you idiot!-"

Scoldrant: "Qw-eh." *It slowly tilted its slug-like head and suddenly spat out a string of green jelly.*

Tyler: "W-Whoa-"

Lance: *He leant back in shock and gritted his teeth, bending to the side.* "Shit-"

Alicia: "L-Lance!" *She watched Lance barely avoid the string of jelly, causing her to sigh in relief.*

Holland: "They are very slow, but dangerous at the same time."

Lance: *He noticed all the snail-like Scoldrants face him, spitting out strings of green jelly.* "Pssht-" *He jumped back and faced the party, quickly flashstepping next to PKMY.*

Season: "If it can essentially absorb Rostical, how will we defeat these fiends?"

PKMY: "I will flashstep and attack them with physical melee." *She smirked, punching the air in excitement.*

Lezard: "But I heard those shells are tough."

PKMY: "Not as tough as this." *She grunted in confidence, kissing her fist.*

Lance: "Nah, PKMY, those shells are pretty hard." *He spoke with a serious tone, causing PKMY to frown in understanding.*

Holland: *He looked at the party in a worried manner, as if he gained sudden responsibility.* "Tyler and I will handle this!"

Tyler: "H-Huh?"

Lance: "Wait, wut?"

Holland: "Let's go, Tyler." *He stared at the snail-like Scoldrants, bracing himself.*

Tyler: "B-But-"

Holland: "Come on!" *He jumped down a slight slope and ran past Whitehead, forming a fist.*

Freya: *She blasted high into the air and withdrew her wings, tucking in her legs.* (Aerial-)

Season: "Tyler?" *He spoke in a stern tone, causing Tyler to twitch.*

Tyler: "R-Right, Ougi-" *He awkwardly hobbled down the slope with both arms in the RPG bag.*

Freya: *She dived down at incredible speeds, preparing herself for an aerial attack.* (-Pounce.)

Holland: "Alright!-"

*A blast of red lightning sparked in front of Holland and a wall of ice fell from the sky in front of Freya, causing them both to stop.*

Freya: *She suddenly blew back and flapped her wings, gliding along the ground.* (I was repelled?!)

Alicia: "Who?"
Season: "What was that-?"

?????: "Don't, it's a trap-" *A woman with green hair flashstepped in front of the ice, shattering it into nothing.*

Alicia: "P-Pickles?"

Lance: "That her-?!"

?????: "We said it's a trap, so back away." *He mumbled and flashstepped in the air, looking down at the party of snail-like Scoldrants.*

Lance: (Brazza!-) *He looked up in surprise.*

Freya: (Grr, should I attack them?) *She gritted her teeth and flapped her wings, hovering in mid-air.*

Holland: (Not yet.) *He frowned in an indecisive manner.*

Brazza: "Watch-" *He pushed downwards and a stream of red lightning struck the ground next to the Scoldrants.*

Pickles: *She waited with anticipation, as if she was expecting something to happen.* "...-"

Lezard: "Holy fishcakes, nothing happened."

Cameron: "Patience-"

*A net of green snot-like jelly, sprung up around the Scoldrants and looped above the treetops.*

PKMY: (The trap!)

Lance: (Crap! I could've got caught in that!)

Tyler: *He slowly pulled his hands out of the RPG bag.* "A net?"

Holland: (When did these Scoldrants become predators like this?)

Pickles: "The best choice for us is to retreat!" *She looked back to the party in concern, waving two daggers of ice in her hands.*

Brazza: "These creatures aren't to be taken lightly." *He landed on the ground and looked over his shoulder to the party, mumbling in a serious manner.*

Lance: "Oi, quick fingers, ogre! Come on!" *He shouted, waving his arms for them to come back.*

Tyler: "Arh-" *He hobbled around and faced the party, awkwardly running towards them in fear.*

Holland: "Freya-" *He faced the party and stepped forward, jumping into the air.*

Freya: (Got you-) *She spiralled at amazing speeds and dived under Holland, carrying him towards the party.*

Lezard: "HEALING RINGS" *He focused his attention on Whitehead and his men, watching several white rings spiral around them.*

Alicia: "U-Umm." *She coughed in a petite manner, facing the pirate-like bandits.* "HEALING RINGS"

*Alicia straightened her arms and another set of white rings spiralled around the men, causing the area to brighten.*

Cameron: (This seems to be a well-balanced party, a suitable party to fight the Consultant.)

Whitehead: "A-Argh?" *He grunted and leant up, holding his head in pain.*

Man: "B-Boss, look out for the trap!-" *He moaned, gasping into consciousness.*

Whitehead: "Where?"

PKMY: "No time-" *She grunted with impatience, looking at the snail-like Scoldrants.* "I don't want to test these things out."

*The rings of light stopped glowing, causing Lezard and Alicia to lower their arms.*

Scoldrant: "Qweh." *It slowly moved towards the party.*

Season: "Is everyone okay?" *He glanced at each party member.*

Whitehead: "Besides a slight headache, I'm great, argh." *He grunted and stood up, stroking his beard.*

Lezard: "That's exceptionally great."

Alicia: "Exceptionally? Great?" *She spoke in a nervous and curious manner.*

Season: "Whitehead, we may need to take a detour around these Scoldrants."

Whitehead: "I'm not complaining."

Lance: "Huh? Why?" *He grunted with impatience as he stared at the Scoldrants slowly moving closer towards him.* "No detours, aye, just run around 'em-"

Cameron: "Make a move on!" *He spoke with authority and ignored Lance, motioning Whitehead to lead the way.*

Whitehead: "A detour is fine-" *He started to run into the distance, causing his men and the party to follow.*

Season: *He glanced at Pickles and Brazza.* "I appreciate your help, come with us?"

Brazza: "Nah, we're fine right now." *He mumbled in a deep tone, flicking his hair out of his face.*

Pickles: "Go-" *She clicked her fingers, causing pillars of ice to erupt around the Scoldrants.*

Season: "Stay safe!" *He shouted with determination and hobbled after the party.*

PKMY: *She jumped around thick roots and flipped over several rocks in an acrobatic manner.* "Why aren't you complaining?" *She looked at Lezard who hobbled over the rocks.*

Lezard: "We're on a time limit."

Whitehead: "We've somehow made great time, argh."

Lance: "How?" *He ran in front of Alicia and Tyler, raising an eyebrow at Whitehead.*

Whitehead: "Well, we already passed The Lost City and we just passed Sakura Village."

Lance: "So, wat are you sayin'?"

Whitehead: "We're almost at The Swirling Marshes."

Lance: "Aye?"

Alicia: "W-We're nearly there."

Lance: "Ah-" *He raised his head in understanding, smiling in excitement.* "Kool."

Cameron: "You appear to move quite nimble and alacritous in these woods."

Whitehead: "The tops guilds learn to smooth sail around these Spacial Funnels and Reality Sekais, argh."

Lezard: "Lezard agrees!"

Holland: *He glided above the party on Freya, smiling at the treetops.* "We're nearly at The Swirling Marshes? That's great."

Season: *His robes flapped as he slowly caught up to the party.* "W-What was that, Whitehead?" *He spoke under his breath, gasping for air.*

Cameron: "We are near our destination."

Season: "Excellent!"

Alicia: "What should we do about Pickles and-" *She paused, looking at Lance in recollection.* "Brazza?"

PKMY: (Brazza? That Elementalist Lance was talking about before.)

Season: "They should be fine. Don't worry about them, Alicia."

Apollo: (If we are closer to The Swirling Marshes than anticipated, that may explain the previous Scoldrants we encountered.)

Cameron: "It appears I have underestimated how far we travelled. Apollo has mentioned the geographic location, which explains the previous hostiles' unexpected encounter."

Tyler: "The snails?" *He awkwardly stepped down a slight slope, listening to his RPG bag rattle.*

Lezard: "They usually live near swamps or lakes."

Cameron: "Indeed, for a Scoldrant User, it was an inexcusable oversight."

Lezard: *He held his cone-shaped hat with one hand while continuing to run with the party through the forest.* "Oh, this isn't delicious, I'm getting tired."

Tyler: *He started to breathe heavily, looking at the party with red cheeks.* "D-Do you think-?" *He inhaled and licked his lips, trying to talk through his fatigue.*

PKMY: "..." *She ran with her arms swaying behind her back, showing no signs of being tired.*

Tyler: "Do you think we're safe from those Scoldrants now?"

Alicia: "C-Could we please stop running?" *She ran in a petite manner with her arms slightly raised, causing her pendant and hair to sway to each side.*

Lance: "Yea, I'm gettin' a little tired too, aye."

Cameron: *He glanced at the party with an emotionless face, continuing to run without a sign of fatigue.* (They may be captain levelled, but, they certainly did not endure the same, harsh training as I did.)

Whitehead: "There should be a large clearing next to a cliff. We can rest there, argh."

Lance: "Cliff? But ain't we runnin' away from the shore?"

Whitehead: "No, we just ran around the Scoldrants."

Season: (This is splendid! Although.. I'm hoping we reach the vessel before sunset.) *He smiled in thought, keeping a steady running pace.* (But, I'm not complaining about our progress.)

Lance: *He blew through his mouth as he tried to control his breathing.* "So, could someone let me know wat's happenin'?" *He grunted in confusion, pointlessly jumping over small rocks.*

Man: "The clearing is up ahead." *He grunted from in front of the party as he ran in between thick, pine-like trees.*

Holland: (Up ahead?) *He thought in a curious manner, watching Freya's shiny fur blow in the wind.*

Freya: (Yes-) *She tilted her head up and flew above the treetops, causing sunlight to shine in their eyes.*

Holland: *He looked down and opened his eyes, glancing across to the ocean in amazement.* "Wow-" *He mumbled under his breath, loosening his grip on Freya's fur.*

Freya: *She hovered in the air as cool gusts of wind blew in every direction.* (This is-)

Alicia: *She ran into a grassy clearing and slowly walked along the cliff, staring out into the ocean.* "P-Pretty."

Holland: *He looked down, watching the party enter the clearing.* (This is the environment's natural beauty.) *He smirked and looked back to the ocean, admiring the scenery.*

Lance: "The party scattered across the clearing, observing its surroundings."

Lezard: "Noppers, you said it all wrong-"

Lance: *He stood by himself and looked away, waving Lezard off.* "Don't care."

Cameron: *He observed the area, causing him to discreetly relax.* "We should be safe here."

Lezard: *He took a deep breath, glancing at Cameron in confusion.* "How would you know?"

PKMY: "This is a warrior's campsite."

Lezard: "Ooo-" *He squealed in a curious, sarcastic manner.*

PKMY: "If you give me any sarcastic crap-" *She stopped in mid-sentence and formed a fist, glaring at Lezard.*

Lezard: "Crap? Jinkies, I wouldn't dream of it." *He shook his head and hands at PKMY.*

PKMY: "Good-"

Lezard: "No way I'd give you any poop. That stinks-"

PKMY: "You!-"

Man: *He plunked himself on the grass and sighed, adjusting a headband-like bandanna on his forehead.* "I'm buggered, boss."

Whitehead: *He noticed his men on the ground panting for air.* "We're to have a short rest here."

Lance: *He tilted his head up in disagreement, unintentionally frowning at Whitehead.* "Why? Let's rest on the ship?"

Season: "A ship run by tired crew members can be very dangerous."

Whitehead: "Exactly, argh."

Lance: *He folded his arms and turned away, pouting like a child.* "True."

PKMY: (Heh.) *She smirked at Lance in respect and stepped to the side, observing the area around her.*

Freya: *She slowly glided down next to PKMY and bent her legs, gently landing on the ground.* (How are you feeling?) *Holland jumped off her back, causing her body to shrink in size.*

PKMY: *She turned around in boredom, looking at Freya and Holland.* "I'm just thinking about Teresa."

Freya: "Ruff?"

PKMY: *She straightened and lowered her arm, looking at Holland.* "Well, it's unlike her not to contact me by now. And if she didn't, she would've let me know already-"

*Freya jumped up onto PKMY's hand and ran up her arm, standing on her shoulder.*

Holland: "She's a strong woman." *He walked behind PKMY and wrapped his arms around her, forcing her to face the ocean.*

PKMY: *She stared at the glittering ocean with an emotionless face.* "I know.." *She raised her arms and rubbed Holland's hand, causing Freya to squeak in a happy manner.*

Alicia: *She walked closer to the cliff and elegantly leant against a tree, watching the branches gently sway in the wind.* (My life has changed-)

Lance: "Hey." *He quietly mumbled to Alicia, walking over to her.*

Alicia: *She looked at Lance, causing him to smile.* "Lance."

Lance: *He slowly wrapped one arm over her shoulder.* "What are you thinkin' about?"

Alicia: *She stared out into the ocean.* "Just how much my life has changed."

Lance: "Oh really?" *He sounded interested as if he wanted to know what Alicia had to say.*

Alicia: "I wanted an adventure badly."

Lance: "Aha, we're already on one?"

Alicia: *She nodded her head with an emotionless face.* "I know. But, I really wanted one."

Lance: "How come?"

Alicia: "U-Umm-" *She looked down and became quiet, biting her bottom lip.*

Lance: "It's fine, you don't have to tell me, aye." *He spoke in a caring manner, suddenly embracing Alicia with a widening smile.*

Alicia: *She smiled in comfort, watching the waves crash against the rocks in the distance.* "There are a few reasons why I wanted an adventure, and one is because-" *She subconsciously grabbed Lance's hand.* ".. I get lonely."

Lance: (What?) *His eyes widened in shock.* "I-.. I get lonely too."

Alicia: *She looked at Lance surprised.* "Really? Does adventure make that feeling go away?"

Lance: "Yes and no."

Alicia: "Do you feel it now?"

Lance: "No." *He gently placed his other arm over Alicia's stomach, giving the illusion he hugged her from behind.* "That feelin' goes away when I'm with you."

Alicia: *She paused and shook her head, looking back to the waves.* "I'm so glad to have met you."

Lance: (Aha.) *He chuckled in thought, looking at the waves in happiness.*

Alicia: "You're one of the reasons I've been travelling with the party."

Lance: *He released his grip around Alicia.* (For... Me?)

Alicia: *She turned around and faced Lance, unsure what to say.* "Umm-"

Lance: *He lifted his chin and grabbed the chain to his pendant which was hidden under his clothes.* "You see this-?" *He pulled the chain out, showing Alicia the lunar-shaped pendant.*

Alicia: "What about it?"

Lance: *He reached for Alicia's sun-shaped pendant, placing his pendant against hers.* "It connects perfectly."

Alicia: "Yes." *She nodded her head, staring at the pendants.*

Lance: "And, that's how I feel."

Alicia: "You want to merge the pendants together?"

Lance: "Aha, no, I mean-" *He awkwardly scratched behind his head, trying to gather courage.* "I think we fit perfectly together."

Alicia: *She looked at Lance with blushing cheeks, unsure what to say.* "..."

Lance: "Umm, yea.."

*A gust of wind blew across Lance and Alicia, blowing their hair to one side.*

Alicia: "You're perfect."

Lance: *He gasped in shock and amazement, slowly shaking his head with a smile.* "Nah, I'm far from perfect, aye."

Alicia: "But, to me-"

Lance: "You're not perfect either."

Alicia: "S-Sorry?"

Lance: "But, together.. I rekon we fill each other's void-" *He mumbled under his breath, nervously glancing away.* "We're perfect for each other."

Alicia: *She smiled and discreetly nodded her head, leaning towards him.* "I-I agree-" *She slowly closed her eyes and kissed him on the lips.*

Lance: *He grabbed Alicia with both arms, looking into her eyes.* "I'm glad you do because that was so nerve rackin'-" *He smiled, kissing her slightly harder.*

Alicia: *She slowly opened her eyes, watching Lance lean away.* "Tee hee."

Lezard: *He stood with Season, Cameron and Tyler.* "Isn't it romantic?" *He sarcastically swayed his bottom, forming a heart with his hands.*

Season: "They should enjoy it while it lasts."

Tyler: "Season?" *He pulled his hand out of the RPG bag and handed Cameron several berries.*

Cameron: "I appreciate these Acro Berries, I am in dire need of energy."

Season: *He glanced at PKMY and Holland, listening to them talk amongst themselves.* "Because-"

*Season looked at Alicia and Lance, watching them stare out into the ocean.*

Season: "Because we have no idea what we're going to be up against when we confront the Consultant."

Lezard: *He overheard Season, causing him to appear serious.* "Yes."

Cameron: "I also concur."

Tyler: *He brushed the RPG bag in confusion.* "I don't understand."

Season: "We don't know if all of us will come back after the fight."

Tyler: *He paused in thought.* "O-Oh."

Cameron: *He glanced at Season as he consumed the Acro Berries.* "Precisely."

Lezard: "The harsh fact about fighting."

Tyler: *He realised what Season meant, causing him to look down in disappointment.* "I-I.. Never actually thought about that." *He spoke in a slow, serious manner.*

Season: "Each and every one of us, are putting their lives on the line to stop Ridley."

Lezard: *He nodded his head in agreement.* "..."

Cameron: "I was lied and betrayed to, I have to confront him about it."

Season: *He closed his eyes and slowly inhaled the salty air.* (I just hope all of us come back alive.)

----------

Locki: *A revitalising ray of pink light fell from the cave's roof and shined on Teresa and Jewel.* (This should work, it's my strongest-)

Teresa: *She gasped into consciousness and coughed in pain.* "Krarh."

Locki: *He closed his eyes as red sparkles glittered around their visible wounds.* "The Seraph."

Jewel: "O-ow-oof." *She coughed and rolled on her side, gasping for air.*

*The sparkles disappeared and faded with the pink light, leaving Teresa and Jewel fully revitalised.*

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She exhaled in disappointment as if she was angry at herself.*

Locki: "Thy have been commanded to ask thou what happened? Also, any knowledge you possess of Sofia."

Jewel: *She blinked several times and focused on her eyesight, watching flowers and grass grow around her with double vision.* (Is that vegetation?!)

Teresa: *She leant up, ignoring the flowers and vegetation which grew around her.* "I-?" *She held her forehead in pain, looking at Locki in confusion.*

Jewel: "It's cold.. But, it's warm?" *She spoke in a lost-like state, reaching out to touch a flower.*

Locki: *He observed Teresa and Jewel, slightly frowning with impatience.* (There is no permanent damage..) "Seraph?"

Teresa: *She looked at Locki, trying to focus her attention on him.* "We fought the Consultant."

Locki: "Hmm?" *He sat down on a bed of growing grass, watching Jewel and Teresa recollect themselves.* "Continue."

----------

Tyler: *He looked inside the empty RPG bag and rummaged his hand around it as if he was moving invisible objects.* (A Hi-Ougi-)

*Tyler thought to himself, triggering flashbacks of Alicia's Ice Dragoon, Lance's electrified fog and Chrisma's Healing Rings.*

Tyler: (I may not have Neurons or Astragons, but, with someone who does-) *He closed the flap to his RPG bag, discreetly glancing at Season.* (The mechanics should still work.)

*Tyler adjusted the RPG bag around his shoulder, sighing in deep thought.*

Tyler: (What if we try it, and it doesn't work? I'd be so embarrassed-)

Whitehead: "All ready, men?"

Crew: "Boss!" *All the men grunted at the same time.*

Whitehead: *He faced the party and coughed to clear his throat.* "We should make another move on. We'll reach her before sunset!"

Season: (Splendid.) *He smiled to himself.*

Holland: (Amy.) *He ignored the party as they slowly started to leave.*

PKMY: "Wat?"

Holland: "..."

Freya: (What is it?) *She turned around and licked Holland's cheek from PKMY's shoulder.*

Holland: "I've been thinking about this for some time. And-"

PKMY: *Her eye twitched with impatience as if she wanted to leave with the party.* "And?"

Holland: ".. I want us to grow old together."

PKMY: "H-Huh?" *She stepped away, facing Holland in shock.*

Holland: "Well, yeah. That's what I want."

PKMY: "I-"

Holland: *He noticed PKMY struggling to talk, causing him to smile.* "Let me know how you feel about it after we defeat the Consultant?"

PKMY: *She nodded her head in relief.* "Yea." *Her face became red.*

Holland: "Alright-"

Lance: "Oi, hurry up!-" *He walked with the party down a slope, shouting over his shoulder at PKMY and Holland.*

PKMY: *She formed a fist, looking past Holland.* "My name isn't oi!"

Lance: "Oi!" *He smiled and poked out his tongue, picking his nose.*

PKMY: "That's it!" *She cracked her knuckles and ran towards Lance.*

Lance: "Ah! Halp!" *He jogged past Lezard and Tyler, running in front of the party.*

PKMY: "Get back here!"

Lezard: "Bwarharh." *He chuckled, watching PKMY chase after Lance.*

Alicia: "Tee hee." *She kept focus on Lance, cupping her pendant with both hands.*

----------

*Tremors echoed from the peak of Turnback Cave and a sudden eruption of flames exploded out from the mountain, causing distant Scoldrants to fly away.*

Phoenix: *Its flames brightly swirled in rings above the cave as it ascended high into the air.* "Are you sure you wish to do this?"

Sebastian: *Flames swirled and burnt off his skin as he stood inside the phoenix.* "Yes!"

Phoenix: "Then perform the words, demand your wish!"

Sebastian: "And with this feather!" *He tightly held a brighter flame which resembled a feather.* "I want to purge the bad stigma against my race! I want to erase the horrible memories my brainwashed brethren have caused!"

Phoenix: *It flapped its wings of fire, causing splinters of bright flames to warp the air behind it.* (His body won't be able to survive the magnitude of flames this will produce-)

Sebastian: "With my wish, I want the rest of my kind to not live in fear because they're different!-" *He coughed out blood as the fire of the phoenix's stomach continued to swirl around him.*

Phoenix: (The Neurons inside the feather-) *Its body grew brighter, noticing its wings change from red to orange.*

Sebastian: "I want to negate the yellow-eyed disease!"

Phoenix: "Kreeeeii." *It flew towards the clouds at amazing speeds, leaving a blaze-like trail behind it.*

Sebastian: *He closed his wolf-like eyes and thought about his tribal members.* (This is for you, everyone-) *His arm splintered away like charcoal.*

Phoenix: *Its bright yellow eyes shined and it screeched.* "Your wish shall be granted!"

Sebastian: *He smiled and closed his eyes, causing a tear to run down, instantly evaporating off his cheek.* (Live in freedom, my family-)

Phoenix: "Kreeeeii." *It stopped in mid-air and swirls of wind and fire imploded around it.*

*The sounds of scorching flames echoed throughout the area.*

Phoenix: (After doing something like this, it will take me time to restore my energy. But, while the source remains out there, it's possible this disease could spread again-)

*The phoenix suddenly exploded and a bright red-yellow wave of mist-like flames pulsed across the lands.*

----------

Lezard: "The party walked down a steep slope towards the first signs of a dirt-like shore."

PKMY: "The land meets the water." *She grunted to herself, staring at the shore.*

Lezard: "Ooo! You're doing the same, delightful child?"

PKMY: "No.. I was mumbling a fact to myself."

Lezard: "Lezard liked the scenery from the cliffs, but it's refreshing seeing a shore."

Lance: "But why is it dirt and not sand?"

Tyler: *He looked at Cameron.* "Is it because of The Swirling Marshes?"

Cameron: "Indeed."

Whitehead: "We're almost here, argh." *He grunted to the party, stroking his beard.*

Lance: "Yes." *He rubbed his hands in excitement.*

Lezard: *He looked up to the sky, adjusting his cone-shaped hat.* "The sky was slightly orange due to the setting sun."

PKMY: "And Lizard kept saying obvious stuff which caused him to get punched in the face."

Lezard: *He looked at PKMY in confusion, shaking his head.* "But, I haven't-?" *He stopped in mid-sentence, realising what she meant.*

Tyler: "So, Whitehead-"

Whitehead: "Hermm?" *He faced Tyler, causing him to nervously look away.*

Tyler: "A-Ah, I was just wondering, who is this Sheridan you keep talking about?"

Lance: "Yea, when do we get to see her?"

Alicia: "But, I thought it was the name of his-"

PKMY: *She walked beside Alicia, nudging her with a semi-smirk.* "Let them figure it out."

Freya: "Ruff!" *She wagged her tail from PKMY's shoulder.*

Alicia: "Tee hee." *She nodded her head and smiled.*

Season: *He looked up to the setting sun.* "Once we're on the vessel, I'd like to talk about several scenarios and plans."

Lezard: "For?" *His feet cushioned on the shore.*

Season: "The Consultant of course."

Lezard: "Oh, right! Sounds scrumptious."

Holland: *He scratched under his chin.* (I'll be needing a shave if we get back-)

PKMY: *She looked directly at Holland.* (When we get back.)

Whitehead: "And here she is!" *He stepped closer to the water and stared out into the ocean.*

Lance: "You crazy, I don't see anythin'?!" *He over-dramatically scanned the ocean.*

Tyler: "Yeah, I don't s-see anything either."

Season: "Kept hidden?"

PKMY: "I'd say Spacial Funnel." *She stopped and leant to one side, placing a hand on her waist.*

Holland: "Maybe a Reality Sekai."

Whitehead: "Behold, my Sheridan!" *He clicked his belt and the air warped above the ocean's water.*

Alicia: "It was in a Reality Sekai." *She smiled in amazement, watching a massive blue ship appear before the party.*

PKMY: "Heh, you doubt me still?"

Alicia: "N-No." *She shook her head.*

Tyler: "I-It's huge." *He spoke in amazement, staring at the size of the ship.*

Lance: "That's what she said, aye, quick fingers?"

Lezard: "Bwarharh, gifted with two things?"

Tyler: "S-Stop." *He coughed with blushing cheeks.*

PKMY: *She rolled her eyes in a disgusted manner.* (Boys..)

Lezard: *He noticed the water crash near Whitehead's feet.* "But what about the water?"

Holland: "What about it?" *He mumbled in confusion.*

Lezard: "You, silly sausage, we'll get wet and not in the way we'd want."

PKMY: "Rank."

Lance: *He looked at Lezard, rolling his eyes.* "This guy for serious?" *He stared at Season, who intentionally ignored him.* ".. Or not, that's kool."

Season: *He admired the Sheridan.* (It's larger than I thought-)

Bandit: "Boss, we'll begin preparations once upon the deck."

Whitehead: "Argh, excellent! Good seeing you again, my Sheridan."

Tyler: (Oh, so Sheridan is the name of his ship.) *He laughed at himself.* (That's what I originally thought.)

Whitehead: "All aboard!" *His voice caused a wooden plank to shoot itself from the ship towards the shore, causing Tyler to flinch in shock.*

Cameron: "That solves your problem." *He spoke in a stern voice as he walked past Lezard.*

Lezard: "Well, you're not wrong!"

Whitehead: *He watched the plank land into the dirt, causing him to rub his beard with excitement.* "Come on, Sheridan won't bite!" *He hobbled onto the plank and started to walk towards the ship.*

Holland: "Alright-" *He took a few steps towards the plank.*

Lance: "Nah, I'm next." *He ran like a child onto the plank, smiling at himself.* "Yea-"

PKMY: "If you're eager to go next, you better not make me wait." *She formed a fist and stormed up to the plank.*

Freya: "Grr!" *She growled at Lance, supporting PKMY's attitude.*

Lance: "Ah-" *He looked back to PKMY with a shocked face.*

Alicia: "Lance.." *She stared at PKMY and Lance.*

Holland: *He smirked and looked at Alicia, shaking his head.* "After you?"

Alicia: "Oh, thank you." *She smiled and tapped her foot on the plank, cautiously stepping onto it.*

Cameron: *He glared at Lance and PKMY mucking about.* "Does that not get annoying?"

Tyler: *He adjusted the strap over his shoulder and walked towards the plank.* "You get used to it."

Season: "It's just their way of having fun."

Cameron: (Fun..?)

Apollo: (What's wrong?) *He flew high in the sky.*

Cameron: (Nothing, most likely nerves-) *He coughed and silently followed Tyler.*

Apollo: (Cameron?)

Cameron: (We are confronting an opponent whose power far exceeds our own.)

Apollo: (True!) "Squawk."

Season: *He watched Lezard hobble in front of him, noticing his cone-shaped hat.* (It's going to be good having two healers in the party.)

Lezard: (No more teleportation Remenistal.. I've always preferred doing things manually to enjoy the journey, but it is unsavoury that we can't just teleport straight there.)

Whitehead: *He watched his men automatically go to their stations and prepare the vessel for sail.* "Welcome to our Sheridan!" *He watched the party step onto the ship, causing him to spread his arms with a proud facial expression.*

Lance: "Kool, are we like pirates now?"

Tyler: "Haha, argh-"

Lance: "Umm, no."

Tyler: "Oh..?"

Lance: "Aha, jokin'! Ships ahoy! Argh-"

Whitehead: "Don't do that."

Lance: *He looked at Whitehead, awkwardly nodding his head.* "No worries."

Whitehead: "Joking! Argh!"

Tyler: "Haha."

----------

*Locki, Teresa and Jewel walked towards the exit of Concern's Gate, listening to their metallic-sounding footsteps echo.*

Locki: "So, Sofia was hidden in the ranks of the warriors?" *He awed in realisation as if it answered several of his questions.*

Teresa: "Precisely."

Locki: "That would make sense how she was undetectable. But then again, we thought she was petrified-"

Jewel: "Tssk-" *She whimpered, holding her stomach in pain.*

Teresa: *She quickly reached out for support.* "Are you okay?"

Jewel: *She nodded her head with the expressions of pain.* "Yes."

*Light shined off Locki and Teresa's armour as they stepped outside the cave.*

Locki: "What are your intentions?"

Teresa: "Go to Surpreon and find where the party is."

Locki: "Thy see."

Jewel: "I will follow Teresa."

Locki: "Just remember, your heart was not beating. Thy highly advised no physical activities for the time being."

Teresa: *She breathed heavily, respectfully nodding her head.* "I understand."

Locki: "Thy must go now."

Jewel: "What will you be doing?"

Locki: "That is none of your concern."

Jewel: (He saved our life..) *She nodded her head as if she didn't mind his rudeness.* "I understand."

Locki: "Thank you for your cooperation-" *He suddenly disappeared in a flash of white light.*

Teresa: "You have my appreciation-" *She stopped in mid-sentence, realising Locki left the area.*

Jewel: *She paused, taking slow deep breaths.* "Teresa?"

Teresa: "Let us go. Surpreon is South." *She faced the forest and stepped forward, looking back to Jewel.*

Jewel: "We've been healed but we are still exhausted."

Teresa: "A warranted statement, but it will be troublesome if we were to cause any additional stress to our party members."

Jewel: "Right. Lead the way." *She dragged her feet as she slowly followed Teresa through the forest.*

Teresa: (Not even we were able to defeat the Consultant.. I can not imagine Amy, Holland, Lance-) *She paused in mid-thought and gritted her teeth, frowning at the scenario she played in her head.*

Jewel: *She slightly hunched forward, watching sweat drip off her face.* (I feel like I've awoken from a day-long slumber.)

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She squinted her eyes and gently ran her fingers along her neck.*

Jewel: "Want to tell me about your party members?"

----------

Lezard: "The party casually relaxed on the ship as it slowly set sail." *He stood at the bow of the ship, observing the party with a smile.* "Whitehead delegated jobs to his crew on the top deck."

*Lezard looked to the side of the ship, causing his smile to widen.*

Lezard: "Season, Tyler and Cameron discussed battle reports amongst themselves on the side of the ship."

*Lezard slowly scanned across the ship, noticing PKMY.*

Lezard: "Lance, PKMY and Holland stood in the middle of the deck, focusing their attention on Freya."

*Lezard sighed and turned around, looking at Alicia.*

Lezard: *He stepped forward and looked over the rail, watching the waves foam around the vessel.* "And me and the little cupcake admired the scenery around them."

Alicia: *She looked to her side and smiled at Lezard, before focusing her attention back to the water.* "Tee hee."

Lance: *He watched Freya jump from PKMY to Holland's shoulder.* "That's really kool for a dumb dog."

Freya: *She stopped moving and faced Lance, lowering her head.* "Grr."

Lance: "Aha, what?" *He leant forward and squinted his eyes, giving Freya a cocky smirk.*

PKMY: "She said, if you do it again she's going to jump up and bite you."

Lance: "Aha, if only she could really talk, too bad she's just a dumb fleabag-"

Freya: "Gruff-" *She pounced off Holland's shoulder and bit Lance on the nose.*

Lance: "Ah! I'm jokin' get it off!"

Holland: "Ha ha. Freya."
PKMY: "Hahaha!"

Freya: "Rff-" *She grunted and stopped moving, causing her to dangle off Lance's nose.*

Lance: "G-Get it off already!" *He spoke as if his nose was blocked.*

Holland: *He smirked, gently grabbing Freya by the stomach.* "Alright."

Freya: *She opened her jaw and looked down to her stomach at Holland's hands.* "Ruff-"

PKMY: "Good girl." *She reached out for Freya, causing Holland to hand her over.*

Lance: "Good!? Good girl?!" *He touched his nose and noticed blood.* "That little demon!" *He squealed, pointing at Freya in disgust.*

PKMY: "I mean, don't ever do that again." *She looked down at Freya in her arms, grunting with sarcastic anger.*

Freya: (What?)

PKMY: (You did good, but next time, bite somewhere-) *She scanned Lance and looked at Freya.* (Where it would hurt more.) *She grinned evil-like, causing Freya to wag her tail in response.*

Freya: (Got it!)

Holland: "You alright?"

Lance: "Well, I know when I'm not wanted." *He stamped his foot like a child and noticed Alicia and Lezard in the corner of his eye.* "I won't forget this! You've made a powerful enemy!" *He glared at Freya as he slowly walked away.*

Freya: "Ruff! Grr!" *She barked at Lance, causing him to hasten his pace.*

Holland: *He faced Freya and PKMY and smiled.* (Naww-)

PKMY: Naww what?"

Holland: "No other person besides Scoldrant Users treats or talk to Freya like that."

PKMY: *She looked surprised and her cheeks became red.* "I hear about the racism and the discrimination, but I don't exactly see it."

Holland: "It's more the little things, like the stares that linger a little longer than normal, the snarky remarks, the subconscious favouritism, the inconvenience just arriving at a city causes and don't get me started on how the warriors treat us."

PKMY: "Really?"

Holland: "We don't have the privilege the perceived normal person has."

Freya: "Gruff!" *She barked in agreement.*

PKMY: "But, we don't often see Scoldrant Users for there to be any racism."

Holland: "Exactly."

PKMY: *She pouted and looked down, gently rubbing behind Freya's ears.* "I'm sorry that you experienced it.. I didn't know how it made you feel until now, you are always so laid-back."

Holland: "Honestly, before I met Freya, I became bitter and started to resent privilege as a whole. I got in fights trying to educate people that we aren't so different."

PKMY: "Yea?"

Holland: "My view on it now, don't take it personally, take it seriously."

PKMY: "I'm going to use that line." *She looked at Holland with a growing smile.* "If I were in charge, shit like that won't ever happen."

Holland: *He smiled and exhaled through his nose loudly.* "You're really a misunderstood sensual person."

PKMY: "Eh?" *She slightly hunched forward with growing emotion as if she didn't know how to respond.*

Freya: "Grr." *She growled at Holland, frizzing her fur at him.*

Holland: "W-What?" *He spoke in an innocent manner as if he didn't know what he did.*

Lezard: "What did you feel when you healed your first person?" *He stared at the water below.*

Alicia: "I remember it clearly. There was a little girl."

Lezard: "Ooo, this already sounds like it's going to be an emotionally moving story."

Alicia: *She shook her head in disagreement.* "In AriAri village, she fell off a stack of crates and cut her arm on a piece of timber."

Lezard: "Ouchies."

Alicia: "There was blood everywhere, and by reaction, I went up to her and started healing her."

Lezard: "It was almost like instinct?"

Alicia: "Y-Yes!" *She enthusiastically nodded her head as if she completely agreed.*

Lezard: "What happened after?"

Alicia: "I can't remember, I fell unconscious."

Lezard: "Me too."

Alicia: "Oh, what about you?"

Lezard: "Mother monster could use Radiatons.. She gave me her powers because I was unable to use Rostical, or Remenistal they liked to call it."

Alicia: "Wow, you were given your powers."

Lezard: "In a sense-" *He paused, looking at Alicia's pendant.* "It's the best gift given to me by my parents."

Alicia: (Wow-)

Lezard: "It almost feels like she fights with me-" *He paused again and felt the breeze against his face.* "Or, she's by my side every time I heal."

Alicia: (He's being serious-)

Lezard: "But at the same time, I hate it-" *He looked at Alicia who gave him her full attention.* "Does that make sense?"

Alicia: "U-Umm, no it doesn't-" *She shook her head and grabbed her pendant.* "But please continue."

Lezard: "I was a researcher like Season and Tyler, so, it was unusual for me to grasp these Radiatons."

Alicia: "How come?"

Lezard: "Well, I never knew about it. I didn't know how they worked."

Alicia: *Lezard's words triggered a flashback of Celest describing the emotions to her.* (Without someone telling him how Radiatons work, I could see how he'd have trouble.. I did too-)

Lezard: "To me, it was just Neurons and Astragons-" *He paused, trying to think of what to say next.*

Alicia: "Well, in the end, you've become a fantastic healer." *She spoke in a caring manner, looking at Lezard with a widening smile.*

Lezard: "You're a very welcoming person." *He smiled.*

Alicia: "I'm sorry?" *She looked at Lezard, watching the bangles from his hat sway to each side.*

Lezard: "You're a very comfortable person to talk to-" *He spoke with a serious smile, triggering a flashback.*

--

Lezard: "Bwarharh, well.. If you really want to know-" *He spoke in a serious manner, catching PKMY's attention.*

PKMY: (His constant cheery personality slowly faded-)

Lezard: "I can't forgive the Consultant for what he did."

*Whitehead and his men walked in front, chattering amongst themselves about preparations to the ship.*

Season: "What did the Consultant do?"

Lezard: "Forgive me, but I just don't feel comfortable telling you."

--

Lezard: "The Consultant, he somehow knew about the Radiaton's ability to prevent any status ailment."

Alicia: *She looked slightly confused, but enthusiastically nodded her head.* "..."

Lezard: "He inflicted mother monster with that yellow-eyed illness, or at least, she received it due to not having her immunity."

Alicia: *She gasped.* "Really? How?"

Lezard: "I'm not sure how.. Ever since then, she changed. Father monster couldn't deal with it, so he went to look for a cure."

Alicia: "Did he find one?"

Lezard: "In the end, I suppose you could say it was a cure... That's one of the reasons why I joined the guild."

Alicia: "The guild? That's what you call yourselves?"

Lezard: "Yes. If I wasn't selfish about revenge, I would be joining them as we speak."

Alicia: "Selfish?"

Lezard: "Joining your party to fight the Consultant, for my own personal reasons."

Alicia: "Oh, okay." *She continued to give Lezard her full attention.*

Lezard: "That is why I can't forgive the Consultant."

Alicia: "Did Lance's talk change your mind?"

Lezard: "It could have been the burgers' influence, but he really put things in perspective for me."

Alicia: *She looked sad and frowned.* "That's also one of the reasons why I want to stop the Consultant. There's always a trail of pain left behind by him."

Lezard: *He nodded his head and adjusted his hat.* "And the other reason-?"

Lance: "Hey hey." *He hobbled next to Alicia and stared at Lezard.*

Alicia: "U-Umm." *She looked down to her pendant and smiled as if the answer was obvious to Lezard.*

Lezard: "Ooo, jinkies." *He looked up and smiled.*

Lance: *He awkwardly looked around as if he wanted privacy with Alicia.* "So-"

Lezard: "Lezard needs to go over here, you sensational silly sausages."

Lance: "Sensational silly-"

Alicia: "Sausages?"

Lezard: "I'm not a sensational silly sausage? You, silly dilly."

Alicia: "Dilly-?"
Lance: "Silly dilly?"

Lezard: *He looked over to Cameron, Tyler and Season.* "Oh sure, I'll be there in a moment-" *He shouted out to them as if he was in a conversation.* "Sorry-"

*Lezard quickly faced Lance and Alicia and bowed, taking a few steps away.*

Lezard: "I better go, talk to you later." *He quickly hobbled away, purposely rocking his bottom to each side with every step.*

Lance: "But they didn't call you, they're not even looking at you-" *He mumbled in confusion and faced Alicia.* "-And I thought you and PKMY were weird."

Alicia: "Tee hee, you're weirder."

Lance: *He gasped with a smirk.* "I guess it's better than being a grottom bottom." *He pretended to be Alicia, speaking in a goblin-like tone.*

Alicia: *She shook her head with a smirk-like frown, noticing the bite marks on Lance's nose.* "What are you doing?" *She reached up, gently placing her hand on his nose.*

Lance: "You know, just bein' kool 'n' stuff."

Alicia: "Oh really? I thought you were pretty good at being a shit nugget." *She giggled, watching light glow around her hand.*

Lance: "Oh snap, I don't have a come back to somethin' that awesome!"

Alicia: *The glow faded, causing her to lower her hand.* "Yeah, I learnt from the best."

Lance: *He touched his nose in amazement.* (Healed..) *He walked towards the rails and leant against the ship, watching the waves move past the vessel.* "So, what were you two talkin' about?"

Alicia: *She leant against the ship next to Lance and looked into the setting sun.* "Just our healing powers-"

Lance: *He smiled with confidence and leant towards Alicia, kissing her on the lips.* "Thanks for the nose by the way."

Alicia: *She smiled and bit her bottom lip.* "That's okay."

Lezard: (I wonder what the conversation is about.) *He walked up to Tyler, Season and Cameron.*

Tyler: "I've got some paralysing vapours, but I have a feeling it won't work against the Consultant."

Cameron: "It is unfortunate, with our combined powers, we do not possess any effective binding techniques."

Season: "That is unfortunate." *He mumbled to himself in thought, placing his hand on his chin.*

Lezard: "Excuse me-" *He looked at the party as if he needed permission to speak.*

Season: "I'm accepting any suggestions."

Lezard: "Well, my guild have been able to do multiple Hi-Ougis, perhaps we could devise an elemental cage? We don't need an actual binding technique, but make one."

Cameron: "Hmm? We have been looking into items or binding techniques, we never actually thought of using what we already have."

Season: "That thought didn't even occur to me."

Tyler: *He smiled at Lezard.* (That didn't cross my mind either.)

Season: "Please, let us know what happened?"

Lezard: "Sure, it was in one of our battles with The Black Brigade-"

----------

*Cassidy and Lorilei cautiously walked through the prehistoric-like forest, shuffling past different types of ferns.*

Lorilei: "Oh my."

Cassidy: *He frowned in concentration, knocking several leaves and branches out of his face.* "What is it?"

Lorilei: "It's really thick through here."

Cassidy: "We've been through worse."

Lorilei: "You're quite right." *She spoke with a high tone of voice, preoccupied with moving the ferns away.*

Cassidy: *He stopped and peaked through the ferns, staring into a clearing.* (The energy signature, it's here-)

Lorilei: *She shuffled behind Cassidy and touched his shoulder, trying to look in front of him.* "What is it?"

Cassidy: "Are you ready?"

Lorilei: "Mmhmm." *She silently nodded her head, staring at the wall of vegetation.*

Cassidy: "Alright, on three."

Lorilei: "Of course."

Cassidy: "One, two-"

Darkwing: *It glanced around and stared at the vegetation in a curious manner.* "S-k-k-k-k-"

Cassidy: "-Three." *He jumped out of the bushes with Lorilei, startling the Darkwing.*

Lorilei: "LIGHTNING BLAST" *She pushed forward from behind Cassidy and a stream of lightning blasted into the Darkwing, exploding it into dust.*

Cassidy: "Under the highest orders you are to go down!" *He grunted in anger, staring in front.*

Sofia: "Harh?" *She slowly looked over her shoulder with a bored expression on her face.* "Oh? Cassidy? Lorilei? It's great to see you two again."

Cassidy: "Don't give me that!"

Sofia: *She turned around and faced the knights, causing Lorilei to step back.* "Want to play a game with me?"

----------

*Season, Tyler and Cameron looked at Lezard with interested faces.*

Lezard: "And that's how that member was defeated."

Season: "Amazing."

Tyler: "Lance could be the Elementalist that would pull it off." *He spoke in excitement as if it related to Lezard's story.*

Lezard: "Sounds scrumptious!"

Cameron: "I will tell him the plan in regards to the binding technique Lezard brought into the conversation-"

Lezard: "Oh no, please allow me to do the honour."

Cameron: "Very well?"

Lezard: "Coolies." *He smiled and tipped his hat before facing Lance and Alicia.* "I will make my move now."

Tyler: "Huh?" *He gave Lezard an odd look, watching him hobble away.*

Season: "Hohoho."

Tyler: "What's so funny?"

Cameron: "Nor do I see any humour in the previous conversation?"

Season: "He's just trying to fit in."

Tyler: "Oh?"

Cameron: "His intentions are not clear, perhaps you are mistaken?"

Season: *He shook his head with a chuckle.* "It's something you pick up."

Cameron: "I see.."

Lance: "Wow, you can fly?!" *He looked up to the clouds in amazement.*

Alicia: "Y-Yep. It was scary at first, but then it was amazing."

Lance: "Well, you're definitely gonna teach me how to some time."

Alicia: "Tee hee, got it-"

Lezard: "Ooo, I hope I'm not interrupting?" *He awkwardly hobbled in between Lance and Alicia, causing them to step to the side.*

Alicia: "Is there something wrong, Lezard-?"

Lance: "Wat ya want?" *He grunted rudely as if he didn't want Lezard there.*

Lezard: "Actually, I'm here for you."

Lance: "W-Wat?" *He slowly looked at Lezard in a curious manner.*

Lezard: "Well, we-" *He suddenly paused and looked Alicia with lowering morale.*

Alicia: "Lezard?"

Lezard: "Oh, just a moment sorry-" *He tilted his head down, causing shadow to hide his face.*

PKMY: "Huh?" *She suddenly looked to her side, staring at Lezard in a confused manner.*

Holland: "Amy?"

Freya: (What's wrong?) *She looked up from PKMY's arms.*

PKMY: "That man..."

Holland: *He looked to his side, staring at Lezard in confusion.* (Lezard?)

PKMY: "Sadness just filled his body. It feels like the emotions he's been denying have been awakened."

Alicia: "What's wrong?"

Lezard: "Just, what I spoke to you about before, memories of my parents have saddened me."

Lance: "Parents?"

Lezard: "D-Don't worry about it, silly saus-"

Lance: "You-" *He spoke under his breath and turned around, staring at the sunset in a mature manner.*

Lezard: "My, dear boy?"

Lance: "Someone once said." *He looked down at his arms and paused as a cold sea breeze wafted past him.*

Lezard: "Someone said, what sorry?" *He spoke in a cheery tone, trying to cover up his sudden sadness.*

Lance: "Laughter is said to set us free-"

Lezard: "Excuse me?"

Lance: *He shook his head, chuckling at himself.* "Nah, it was somethin' stupid I overheard, aye-"

Lezard: "Please tell me?"

Lance: "Nah, it's lame."

Lezard: "If it was worth bringing up in the first place.." *He implied for Lance to tell him regardless.*

Alicia: "Lance?"

Lance: "Arh-" *He sighed and looked at Lezard and Alicia, casually picking his nose.* (A lot of things didn't make sense until now... Maybe this would too?)

Lezard: "It's fine-" *He spoke in understanding, moving the conversation along.* "Lezard appreciates you trying to help, but you two need to know about the plan we just discussed-"

Lance: "Laughter is said to set us free. It helps us become brave. It's like an emotional knife slicin' through tragic situations."

Lezard: "Lezard appreciates food metaphors."

Season: "PKMY, Holland, could you come over here please?" *He waved them over, smiling in excitement.*

Cameron: *He looked at Season, mumbling in a curious manner.* "Besides telling them the plan, why exactly are you smiling?"

Season: "I plan to take full advantage of everyone's abilities."

Cameron: "Explain the thesis behind your words."

Season: "PKMY using her Ougi, it could help us tremendously when we attempt to bind Ridley with Rostical."

Tyler: (Season is really smart-)

*PKMY and Holland walked next to Season, unintentionally forming a circle.*

PKMY: "Wat is it?" *She spoke in curiosity, scratching Freya behind the ears.*

Season: "Well, I want to incorporate your Ougi-"

Lance: "Ahahahaha."
Lezard: "Bwarharharharh."
Alicia: "Teeheehehehehe."

PKMY: "Eh?"

Holland: *He looked behind him in confusion.* "I thought you said he was sad?"

PKMY: "H-He was?"

Season: "What's happening?" *He turned around and looked at Lezard, Lance and Alicia, watching them laugh hysterically.*

Cameron: "What are they doing? How childish."

Tyler: *He chuckled in disbelief, catching the party's attention.* "I don't believe it."

Season: "Don't believe what?"

PKMY: "Have they taken something from your RPG bag?"

Cameron: "That is a plausible scenario."

Holland: *He focused on his eyesight and blinked, causing his vision to change perspective.* "Hmm, I don't think so."

Tyler: "How-?"

Holland: *He squinted his eyes and observed the flow of their blood, watching it course through their bodies.* "Nope, they're fine."

PKMY: "Wow-" *She spoke under her breath, glancing at Holland.* (You can see through different types of ocular vision?!)

Holland: (Haha-) *He glanced at PKMY with the purple ring spiralling around his iris.* (You saw through my eyes?)

PKMY: (Amazing-) *She thought in amazement, causing Freya to wag her tail.*

Lance: "Ahahahaha."
Alicia: "Teeheehehehehe."
Lezard: "Bwarharharharh."

Season: "Do you know what's wrong with them?"

Tyler: "Yes.." *He looked up with a smile, triggering a flashback.*

--

*Tyler slept on his bed with the blankets wrapped around his legs. The room was messy and had piles of dirty clothes scattered across the floor.*

Tyler: *Loud music started to play from the digital clock next to his bed, causing him to twitch.* "Errr-" *He rolled towards a nightstand and hit the clock, causing the music to stop.*

*Tyler looked around the room with blurred vision, feeling the sheets under the pillow.*

Tyler: (Got it-) *He slid his hand out and grabbed a poorly conditioned mobile phone.*

*Tyler rubbed his face and looked at the mobile phone, squinting his eyes.*

Tyler: (No new messages..) *He grunted and leant up, sluggishly putting socks on his feet.* (I better get ready for work...)

--

Tyler: *He swayed as the boat sailed over large waves.* (I can't believe I never used to have breakfast back then!)

--

Tyler: *He looked at himself in the mirror, staring at big red, pussy pimples which covered his face.* (Okay-)

*Tyler took off his plain shirt and put on the Fast Food Enterprise uniform with the logo on the front.*

Tyler: (Off to work.) *He bent down and picked up a bag, walking out of the bathroom.*

*Tyler opened the screen door and walked outside the house, wiping sweat off his forehead.*

Tyler: *He looked down, adjusting his shirt and belt in a geeky manner.* "Going to work now!"

Father: "Alright, let us know if you're getting dropped off after work!"

Tyler: "O-Okay!" *He held a black cap with the FFE logo stitched on the front and placed it on his head.* (I think Twortz is the manager. Jeez, I hope Lance isn't on tonight.)

*Tyler walked across the lawn and stepped onto the pavement, noticing several teenagers riding their bikes towards him.*

Teenager: "If it isn't the swamp-face freak!" *He rode past and knocked Tyler on the shoulder, causing him to stumble back.*

Tyler: "A-Ah-" *He awkwardly leant to the side, allowing the teenagers to ride past.*

Boy: *He rode behind his friends and laughed at Tyler.* "Haha, loser." *He rode past Tyler and flicked his hand to the side, knocking the hat off his head.*

Tyler: *He adjusted the bag and looked over his shoulder, watching the teenagers ride out of his sight.* (They're the losers!)

Teenager: "I know, right? What a dork!" *His voice echoed from down the street, causing Tyler to pout in anger.*

Tyler: (And I'm not a dork!) *He squealed in thought and bent down, picking up the hat in a defeated manner.*

--

Holland: "What are you talking about, Tyler?" *He raised an eyebrow in confusion, glancing at Lezard, Lance and Alicia.*

Cameron: "I do not see how your trivial day can explain their irrational behaviour?"

PKMY: "Should we expect Alicia, Lance and Lizard to start bullying us?"

Tyler: *He shook his head, looking at Lance, Alicia and Lezard.* "Oh, no, they're laughing."

Holland: "They're just laughing?"

Tyler: *He nodded his head, adjusting the RPG bag over his shoulder.* "It was something I was told, to help me."

Season: "Help you?"

PKMY: "I think he's going to tell us a story."

Tyler: "Yes-"

--

Tyler: (On one of my customer service questions-) *He mumbled in thought and walked through a parking lot, awkwardly squirming in between two cars.* (Customers called it a treat when visiting and the regulars always went for a morning breakfast.)

*Tyler mumbled to himself out loud and scratched the pimples on his face, walking up several steps towards the store's entrance.*

Tyler: (-That's what I'll say on the service quiz.)

*Tyler walked up to the door and pulled it open, causing a gust of cold air to blow past him.*

Tyler: "Hmm?" *He scanned across the dining room.* (The dining room is spotless. The windows are all clean. The limestone tables are shiny as new, Lance definitely isn't on.)

Twortz: *She bagged several orders and handed them out to waiting customers.* "Ah, Tyler! I'll have you help out on front tonight."

Tyler: *He adjusted his hat and nodded his head.* "Alright, let me get ready and clock on."

Twortz: "That's fine." *She spoke in a professional manner, serving more customers.*

Tyler: *He walked behind the counter and down the production line.* "Oh, hello, Ashton."

Ashton: *He dried his hands on an automatic hand dryer and looked at Tyler, causing him to smile.* "Hello, Tyler."

Tyler: "Are you working tonight, too?" *He sounded excited to work with Ashton.*

Ashton: "My shift finishes just after the dinner rush, then you've got close with Twortz."

Tyler: "Right." *He smiled and walked through the kitchen, shuffling into the crew room.*

Melinda: *She walked out of the girl's change room and noticed Tyler, causing him to smile.* "Hi." *She spoke under her breath with no enthusiasm.*

Tyler: "H-H-H-H-H." *He stuttered and glared at Melinda with a scary face, watching her walk past him.*

Melinda: *She clocked back on to her shift, shivering in thought.* (What a freak.)

Tyler: "Hi-" *He hunched forward with no morale, waving in front like an idiot.* (I always freeze when we're by ourselves!) *He sighed and hit himself on the head, walking towards the change rooms.* (What a loser!)

--

Cameron: "How does this relate to the strange behaviour those three possess?"

Season: *He rubbed his chin, glancing at Cameron in agreement.* "Does this lead to what's wrong with them?"

Tyler: "Y-Yes."

Season: "Nothing to say, PKMY?"

PKMY: "Nope." (I actually find it interesting, hearing where they come from, what it's like-)

Tyler: "W-Well, I clocked on for my shift and I was backing up front."

Holland: (This story is making me hungry.)

Freya: "Ruff!" *She looked at Holland, barking from PKMY's arms.* (Me too!)

--

Tyler: "H-Have a nice day." *He handed over a bag of food to a customer, watching them leave with a smile.*

Twortz: *She noticed the dining room clear of customers, causing her to glance at Ashton.* "Ashton, could you stay on front while I fill up the drink syrups please?"

Ashton: "Yeah, sure thing."

Twortz: "Thank you. I have to prep for the dinner rush."

Melinda: *She stood with three other crew members, standing behind the display fridge on front counter.* "Like, totally."

Tyler: *He stocked up the straws on front counter and noticed Melinda looking at him.* (She's looking at me!)

*Tyler thought in shock and quickly looked away with widening eyes.*

Tyler: (What do I do?)

Crew: *She walked up to Tyler and smiled, leaning on the counter in an unprofessional manner.* "You're, like, Tyler, right?"

Tyler: "Y-Yes, you're new here, correct?"

Crew: "Umm, like, yeah? Gosh." *She rolled her eyes in an annoyed manner.*

Tyler: "I-I can help you with any procedures, or-?"

Crew: "I just wanted to say, you're really unattractive and we would really appreciate if you stop looking at us."

Tyler: "I, ah-?"

Crew: "I arh." *She mimicked Tyler as if he was an idiot.* "None of us like who you are. You're such a loser-"

Ashton: "Just remember, Twortz expects everything to be stocked up before she comes back out!" *He stocked up the fries, discreetly watching from the mirror in the fry station.*

*Ashton's words caused the crew members to scatter and start stocking up products.*

Tyler: *He stood on the spot, staring into space in a shocked manner.* (What-...?)

Customer: "Hello?" *He walked up to the counter, catching Tyler's attention.*

Tyler: *He turned around and pretended to smile, quickly standing behind a register.* "Place your order when you're ready."

--

Cameron: *He impatiently folded his arms.* "This story is going nowhere-"

Season: *He raised his hand, causing Cameron to stop in mid-sentence.* "Let him finish."

Cameron: "I know we can not hasten this vessel in any way, but we could at least be taking the time to talk strategic-"

Season: "Tyler, continue."

Cameron: "Humph." *He looked away in frustration.*

Apollo: (From what I have seen, Season knows what he is talking about.) *He spoke from Cameron's inner-self.*

Cameron: (And so do I.)

Tyler: "The shift finished and I got home."

--

Tyler: *He took off his hat in exhaustion and sat at the end of his bed, staring at several pimples on his hands.* (If, they don't like me for who I am.. Then I'll change!)

--

PKMY: "Wait a minute!" *She folded her arms, causing Freya to hop onto her shoulder.* "Why are you home? You were telling us about the work thing."

Tyler: "I skipped it."

Cameron: "Now you are dragging this on even more." *He grunted with an emotionless face.*

Holland: "You know, I wouldn't have thought making food would be so exhausting-" *He spoke in a deep voice, triggering flashbacks of cooking the meat.* "But it is."

PKMY: "Right, it's exhausting, wateva." *He grunted at Holland as if she wanted to know more about Tyler's story.*

Tyler: "So, I started my next shift, with the same rosters-" *He looked at each party member, watching their hair move in the strong sea breeze.* "I knew it was a long shift, but I remember it felt like ages."

Holland: "Same rosters? What does that mean?"

Season: "The same people were on."

Tyler: "Yes." *He nodded his head in agreement.*

Holland: "Have you been to his land as well?"

Cameron: (From his land? I am tediously confused at this whole conversation.)

Apollo: (Me too.) *His voice echoed in Cameron's head.*

Season: *He looked at Holland, scratching his arm under his robe.* "We use rosters for Battling Oxident."

Holland: "Oh-" *He looked up in realisation.*

Cameron: "Just continue so we can discuss more important stuff after." *He spoke as if he was getting tired of the conversation.*

Tyler: "O-Okay-"

--

Melinda: "It won't be long." *She handed a customer her change and turned around, facing the drink dispensers.*

Twortz: "The phone is ringing, I'll be back momentarily." *She announced to the staff members, before hastily walking towards the office.*

Tyler: *He reached for a bag and placed a napkin in it.* "Just two regulars please." *He spoke to Ashton who prepared the fries.*

Ashton: "Two regulars, thank you."

Crew: *She stood next to Tyler, whispering so only he could hear.* "Oh, so, if it isn't, like, the loser again."

Tyler: "Well, if it isn't the ugly cow, I remember you." *He mumbled to her, trying to hide his hurt emotions.*

Crew: "W-What?" *She looked at Tyler in shock, unintentionally scrunching up a napkin in her hand.*

Tyler: "Can't you understand?" *He hissed and reached down, picking up the burgers from the heating zone.*

Melinda: *She overheard and gasped.* "Tyler, what is your problem?!"

Tyler: "W-Well, I was just saying.. You want to have a cry? There are napkins over there?"

Melinda: *She placed a lid on the drink and rolled her eyes.* "You're acting like Lance, it just makes you an even bigger loser."

Tyler: "Well-" *He grunted and stormed next to Ashton, opening the bag in frustration.*

Ashton: "Tyler?"

Tyler: *He grabbed the fries and placed them in the bag before handing it over to the customer.* "Here."

Ashton: "Here? Tyler, that's not what we say to our customers-"

Tyler: "Screw the customers, and screw you all. You're the losers." *He grunted at the crew members.* "You're the losers!-"

Ashton: "Tyler, go on break."

Tyler: "B-But, I'm not due for another ten minutes!"

Ashton: "Tyler."

Tyler: *He tapped his feet in anger and stormed down the production line, making his way to the crew room.* "Whatever!"

Melinda: "Ha, what was his problem?"

Crew: "I like, have no idea, like." *She rolled her eyes and chuckled, chewing on a piece of gum.*

Ashton: "Actually, I want a word with you all."

Melinda: *Ashton's presence caused her to stand up straight with respect.* "I'm sorry, what about?"

Ashton: "Your performance from yesterday."

Crew: (Shit, he was there?)

Ashton: "I'm just about to finish, I want to speak to you individually about what happened. And what actions I will be following." *He spoke calmly to the crew members, giving a sense of professionalism.* "Do you all understand this?"

Crew: "L-Like, yes?"
Melinda: "Yes."

Ashton: *He watched the crew nod their heads.* "Good-"

Twortz: *She hung up the phone and smiled, walking out of the manager's office.* "Another compliment, what an outstanding shift-" *She happily thought to herself, walking towards the front counter.*

Ashton: (I may have to issue written documents-) *He sighed to himself.*

Twortz: *She noticed the crew members standing on the spot, ignoring their tense facial expressions.* "Stock up now please." *She spoke in a stern voice.*

Melinda: "Yes-" *She quickly spoke and noticed a customer walking towards the counter.* "How can I help you?"

Twortz: "Ashton, before you go, please write up a to-do list for each crew member."

Ashton: "No worries."

Crew: (This sucks-) *She pouted as she refilled the napkin dispenser.*

--

Cameron: "This is still going nowhere."

Tyler: "I'm almost finished, I promise."

Cameron: "Fine."

--

Tyler: *He shuffled into the crew room and grumbled with a squeal, throwing his hat onto the ground.* "Stupid!"

Ashton: *He walked into the crew room and noticed Tyler sitting down.* "Tyler."

Tyler: *He looked up in shock as if his anger temporarily subsided.* "A-Ashton-"

Ashton: "Come with me."

Tyler: "What about your shift?"

Ashton: "I just finished-" *He turned away and silently walked out of Tyler's sight.*

Tyler: *He stood up, walking out of the room in a curious manner.* (Huh? What does he want-?)

*Tyler looked to each side and instantly noticed the ladder in confusion.*

Tyler: (The ladder is down?)

Ashton: "Tyler?" *His voice echoed from the ladder.*

Tyler: "What?" *He shook his head, mumbling to himself in confusion.*

--

PKMY: "So, what happened next?"

Holland: "Was he up the ladder or was it an illusion?"

Tyler: "Haha. No-"

Season: "Let him finish."

Holland: "Right."

--

Tyler: *He climbed up the ladder with a feminine grunt and popped his head up, observing the roof.* "Ashton?"

Ashton: "Over here." *He leant over the stone wall and stared at several cars, watching them drive down the street.*

Tyler: "What did you want to see me for?" *He stepped onto the roof, speaking with slight exhaustion.*

Ashton: "Did you know how much laughing affects the body and mind?"

Tyler: "No?" *He shuffled up to Ashton and leant against the stone wall.*

Ashton: "I've spoken to the crew members involved and I also want to speak to you."

Tyler: "About?"

Ashton: "Tyler?" *He sounded disappointed, looking at Tyler as if he already knew.*

Tyler: "Sorry." *He sounded apologetic, discreetly scratching a pimple on his chin.*

Ashton: "I thought you handled it well yesterday, but today was not acceptable."

Tyler: "I know, it wasn't good."

Ashton: "No, it was unacceptable."

Tyler: "I-I won't do it again... I promise."

Ashton: "If you feel angry or sad, there's a technique I used to try."

Tyler: "A technique..? When were you angry and sad?"

Ashton: "Everyone experiences it, even me. It's unacceptable to think otherwise."

Tyler: *He slightly smiled in sadness, nodding his head.* (He's right-)

Ashton: "I will tell you the saying and how to do it."

Tyler: "Alright?" *He sounded eager and hesitant, unsure what to expect.*

-

Lance: *He stormed past the counter with a cocky smirk, glancing at Twortz.* "Oi, Twotters-" *He stood at the end of the counter and leant against it like a child, picking his nose.*

Twortz: *She stopped and slowly faced Lance, glaring at the finger in his nose.* "What do you want, Lance? You don't have a shift today.. Are you here to volunteer?"

Lance: "Pssht, you're funny Twotters, I certainly didn't know that."

Twortz: "... Besides hearing my hilarious jokes, what are you doing here?"

Lance: "Where's Ash?"

Twortz: "He's at the back, he hasn't left yet."

Lance: "No worries-" *He walked past the counter and rudely stumbled past Melinda, causing her to gasp in disgust.*

Melinda: "Umm, excuse me?!"

Lance: *He looked behind him to Melinda.* "Excused." *He smirked like a child and walked out of her sight.*

Melinda: "Grr, can we fire him?"

Twortz: "Melinda, get back to work."

Melinda: "Yes." *She sighed and slouched her shoulders, continuing to bag the fries.*

-

Ashton: "The saying goes like this, are you listening?"

Tyler: "Yes." *He faced Ashton and gave him his full attention.*

Ashton: "Laughter is said to set us free. It helps us become brave. It's like an emotional knife slicing through tragic situations."

Tyler: "Is that a quote from something?"

Ashton: *He shook his head in response, continuing what he was saying.* "It's one of the best medicines naturally learnt through happy moments in life.. And with those happy memories, it eventually helps us get back on to the right path."

Tyler: (Wow, that was deep.)

Ashton: "You're probably thinking, that was a little bit too much. But, it's used for any sort of negative situation."

Tyler: "Yes, but I'm still a little confused. You want me to say that out loud? Because, how would that make me feel better?"

Ashton: *He smiled and silently shook his head.* "No, this is what I want you to do."

Tyler: "Okay?" *He stepped back in confusion.*

Ashton: "Hahaha."

Tyler: "Huh?"

Ashton: "Hahahaha."

Tyler: "What are you doing? What do you want me to-?"

Ashton: "Hahahahaha."

Tyler: "Are you okay?"

Ashton: "Do it."

Tyler: "Do what?"

Ashton: "Laugh."

Tyler: "Ha ha ha?" *He shook his head and motioned his hands as if he had enough.* "Sorry, Ashton, I think this is stupid."

Ashton: "Do it, with enthusiasm, just do it loudly."

Tyler: "I'm a little hungry and I'm only on my break. I'm sorry for the way I acted-"

Ashton: "Just do it, Tyler."

Tyler: "Okay." *He sighed with a squeal and took a deep breath, bracing himself to laugh.*

Ashton: "Ready?"

Tyler: "Ha ha ha ha ha." *He quickly lowered his head, looking around slightly embarrassed.* "There, can I go-?"

Ashton: *He leant over the stone wall.* "Hahahahahahahaha, ah- hahahahahaha." *He yelled out his laugh, causing several people on the sidewalk to look up in confusion.*

Tyler: *His lips wobbled as he tried not to laugh.* "You look really silly, Ashton-"

Ashton: "Hahahaha hahahahahahaha, hahahahaha hahahahaha."

Tyler: "Ha ha ha-" *He covered his mouth in shock.* (What?)

Ashton: "Hahahaha hahaha." *He laughed harder.*

Tyler: "Ha haha hahaha ha." *He laughed at Ashton's fake sounding laugh.*

Ashton: *He looked at Tyler, causing him to laugh harder.* "Hahahaha."

Tyler: "Haha haha ha haha."
Ashton: *His fake sounding laughs faded as he started to laugh for real.* "Hahahahahaha."

Lance: *He watched from the ladder in confusion.* (What the f-?)

--

Cameron: "So, what did laughing accomplish?"

Season: *He smiled at Cameron.* "Yes, Tyler, what did it accomplish?"

PKMY: "This better be worth the wait?" *She grunted, forming a fist in Tyler's face.*

Tyler: "What did the laughter accomplish?" *He looked down, smiling in recollection.* "We laughed so hard we weren't making any noises."

--

*Tyler and Ashton wheezed with laughter as tears ran down their cheeks.*

Ashton: "Phew." *He took a deep breath, sighing in exhaustion and satisfaction.*

Tyler: *He sniffed and wiped the tears away.* "I was so laughing at your laugh."

Ashton: "Mine?! I was laughing at yours!"

Tyler: "Ha ha, sure."

Ashton: "How do you feel?"

Tyler: "Umm?" *He recollected his composure and felt his stomach.* "Well, besides my stomach aching, I feel pretty good."

Ashton: "You're welcome." *He smiled and placed his hand on Tyler's shoulder.* "It helped me when I randomly felt sad or bored."

Tyler: *He smiled to himself in amazement.* (Ashton...)

Ashton: *He nodded his head in approval and walked towards the ladder.* "Lance?" *He sounded surprised.*

Lance: "Oh, did I interrupt somethin'?"

Ashton: "Nope, you still up for tonight?"

Lance: "Well, you can watch the movie with your new best friend if ya want?"

Tyler: *He slowly faced Ashton and Lance.* (He doesn't deserve to be Ashton's best friend-)

Ashton: "Just go so I can get down."

Lance: "Wateva." *He looked down and placed his hands on either side of the ladder, sliding down in a cool-like manner.*

Ashton: *He stepped on the ladder, glancing at Tyler with a smile.* "I will see you on your next shift, Tyler."

Tyler: "A-Ah, right!" *He nodded his head and smiled in appreciation, watching Ashton climb down the ladder out of his sight.*

--

Cameron: "So, they are laughing like imbeciles to feel better?"

Tyler: "That's exactly right."

PKMY: *She faced Lance, Lezard and Alicia with understanding.* "Well, that explains what they're doing."

Holland: "It kinda seems fun." *He smiled as if he wanted to try.*

Season: "That was an interesting story, Tyler."

Cameron: "It was slow and dragging-" *He folded his arms, looking at Tyler.* "It was also pointless telling the first half of the story."

Season: "Not really, we wouldn't have known the reasoning behind the laughter."

Cameron: "But I recall not asking for the reasoning-"

Tyler: "Excuse me." *He coughed with respect and turned around, walking away from the party towards Lezard, Lance and Alicia.*

PKMY: *She stared at Tyler's back, frowning in thought.* (From what I felt, their world may not have Rostical, but there are still a lot of stresses involved..)

Lezard: "It feels strange, to laugh like that for no reason?"

Lance: "Well, I saw it, and it works. We'll just have to do it again until it does."

Alicia: "I-I agree, tee hee." *She smiled as if she was enjoying herself.*

Lance: "Hopefully Ash's trick on feelin' better doesn't go viral for the wrong reasons, don't wanna see whole soundtracks bein' dubbed over by our horrible laughs, aye."

Lezard: "Alright, children-"

Tyler: "Mind if I join in?" *He looked at Lance as if he knew what was happening.*

Lance: "Yea, sure?" *He sounded surprised.*

Alicia: "All you have to do is-"

Tyler: "Laugh?"

Alicia: "Yeah, have you tried this, too?"

Holland: "I haven't." *He stumbled up to the party and smirked.*

Alicia: "Holland, you want to try it, too?"

Holland: "Why not?" *He mumbled in his deep voice, scratching the facial hair under his chin.*

Lance: "Aha, alright." *He smiled in excitement, rubbing his hands together.* "On three."

PKMY: *She glanced at Season and Cameron.* "Although I get what the point of it is, it's not like we're angry or depressed?"

Season: "That is true." *He smiled with anticipation as he waited for their laughter.* "But we're all on edge with our big fight coming up. It will relax us."

PKMY: "Eh?" (I do feel tense-)

Lance: "Ahahahaha."
Tyler: "Haha ha ha haha."
Lezard: "Bwarharharharh."
Alicia: "Teeheehehehehe."
Holland: "Ha ha, haha, ha ha."

*The party stopped at the same time and looked at each other with contained faces.*

Alicia: "Teeheehehehehe."
Lezard: "Bwarharharharh!"
Holland: "Ha ha, haha, ha ha."
Lance: "Ahahahaha!"
Tyler: "Ha ha ha ha ha ha!"

PKMY: *She smirked as she walked towards the laughing party members.* (I sense their emotions, and they're laughing for real.)

Cameron: "I find the very idea of this absurd-"

Season: "I'll be back-" *He hobbled towards the party.*

Cameron: "W-?" *He paused in shock, noticing he stood by himself.* "What..?"

Tyler: *He watched PKMY and Season gather around.* "O-Okay, everyone now-?"

Lance: "Ahahahaha."
Season: "Hohohohohohohoh."
Alicia: "Teehee teeheheheehee."
Lezard: "Bwarharharharh." *He held his stomach in laughter, sarcastically wiggling his bottom.*
Holland: "Ha ha, haha, ha ha."

PKMY: "Heh, yahoo."
Freya: "Owhooooo." *She howled towards the sky.*
Tyler: "Ha ha ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha!"

Cameron: *He folded his arms and slightly chuckled at the party, causing him to look away in shock.* (Something this trivial is somehow, making me happy?)

Whitehead: *He heard the shower of laughter, causing him to stumble towards the party from the top deck.* "What the fierce seas are they doing, argh?" *He grunted in a pirate manner, staring at the party in confusion.*

Lezard: "Bwaharh." *He sniffed and lifted his head up, adjusting his cone-shaped hat.*

Season: "Phew-" *He smirked with a satisfying sigh.*

Lezard: "That was deliciously sensational! Thankies, I really appreciated that!"

Lance: (Yea.) *He smiled and chuckled at himself.*

Alicia: "That was fun!"

PKMY: "Heh, it surprisingly was." *She leant to one side, placing a hand on her waist.*

Holland: *His stomach growled, causing the party to chuckle amongst themselves.* "I'm famished-"

Whitehead: "The feast is being served in the cabins, help yourselves and rest for the night! From what I hear, you all have an S-classed quest to attend to, argh!"

Cameron: *He slowly approached the emotionally satisfied party.* "Did you all accomplish what you desired?" *His armour rattled as he moved his arms.*

Season: "Well, I feel slightly better."

Lezard: "And so does Lezard."

Alicia: "But, Lezard, you never told Lance what you were going to say."

Holland: "Why don't we discuss it over the feast?" *He enthusiastically grinned at each party member.*

Season: "Hoho, I couldn't disagree with you there."

PKMY: "Well instead of saying let's go get it, how about making a move on then."

Holland: "Food?!" *He enthusiastically nodded his head, rubbing his stomach in excitement.*

Lance: "I rekon." *He rolled his eyes with a slight smirk and started to walk towards Whitehead.*

Tyler: (Thanks, Ashton.) *He smiled and looked at the sunset before following the party.*

----------

Teresa: *She ran through Gasher Hills with her arms swaying behind her, watching the area blur past her.* (Tcch, we may need to rest at Surpreon for the night-)

Jewel: *She jumped over several rocks with growing exhaustion, catching Teresa's attention.* "T-Teresa-"

Teresa: *She glanced behind her, slowing down.* "It is fine, the plan to locate the party members' whereabouts will need to wait."

Jewel: "W-Wait?" *She grunted under her breath, shaking her head in a disapproving manner.*

Teresa: "Indeed. It is vital for our bodies to have an adequate amount of rest to expedite healing."

Jewel: "O-Okay." *She panted, covered in sweat.*

Teresa: *She ran across sand, noticing the darkening sky.* (I do not know if it is caused by the removal of The Grand Seal, but my physical attributes are being altered based on emotions alone.)

Jewel: *She closely ran behind Teresa at amazing speeds, trying to keep up with her.* (Even at night, this area is still hot.)

Teresa: *She noticed peculiar rock formations and slowed down again, looking at Jewel.* "We are one more flashstep away."

Jewel: "Alright, let's do this." *She groaned as her image disappeared, causing a swirl of sand to spiral in the air.*

Teresa: "Tcch-" *She quickly looked in front and leapt forward with a disappearing image.* (Amy, can you hear me?) *The terrain blurred past her as she ran at flashstepping speeds.*

Jewel: *She stepped out of her flashstep and looked in front, gasping in disgust.* "H-Huh?"

Teresa: *She noticed lines of snow-like flakes around her, causing her to slow down.* "Snow?" *She stepped out of her flashstep, causing a pulse of dirt to blow in front of her.*

Jewel: "T-Teresa!"

Teresa: *She opened her hand and watched a grey snowflake float down into her palm.* "Charcoal?" *She whispered in confusion.* (Perhaps the heat of Maserio caused a fire-?)

Jewel: "Teresa!"

Teresa: *She looked towards Jewel with urgency.* "What is the-?" *She stopped in mid-sentence and coughed in disbelief.*

Jewel: *She stood on small black pebbles in front of Surpreon.* "Tere-"

Teresa: *Her image appeared next to Jewel.* "Jewel, I would not appreciate it if this were to be another one of your illusions."

Jewel: "I haven't used my illusions as a prank since we were teenagers-"

Teresa: *She looked through a charcoaled crack in the wall with watering eyes.* "I do not understand what could have possibly caused this.."

Jewel: "Teresa-" *She held herself in shock.*

Teresa: "Season-" *She started to panic, taking several steps forward.* "PKMY-" *She stepped through the crack and into Surpreon.* "Everyone!" *She screamed in shock and sadness.*

Jewel: *She quietly followed Teresa inside the colourless dome.* (Surpreon's Spacial Funnel is no longer working-) *She spun around and stared at the broken and damaged walls around her.* (I recall Surpreon being much bigger than this-)

Teresa: "P-Perhaps they are in the Spacial Funnel, in Season's manor-"

Jewel: "T-Teresa, don't fool yourself-"

Teresa: "Not now!" *She screamed and noticed an indent in the middle of the dome, giving the illusion it was hit by a meteor.*

Jewel: "What did you find?" *Pieces of stone fell on to the ground and crumbled to pieces.*

Teresa: "This was no accident." *She bent down and ran her finger along the melted stone.*

Jewel: "Who could possess the power to destroy this city?"

Teresa: "I knew about the city's special barrier." *She shook her head in confusion.* "Season would not have told anyone-"

Jewel: "Surpreon doesn't have a barrier?"

Teresa: "As I previous said, Season would have told no person."

Jewel: "Then.. It couldn't have been the Consultant?"

Teresa: "No..." *She looked down, causing her hair to fall in front of her face.* "It could not have been-"

Jewel: "Maybe this was a natural occurrence?"

Teresa: *She gritted her teeth in recollection, suddenly triggering flashbacks of Riddle holding several books.* "But, he could have!" *She screamed and punched the ground, causing it to rumble.*

Jewel: *She spread her legs to keep her balance.* "I don't understand, Teresa?"

Teresa: "..." *She brushed charcoal and debris off the ground around her, before lying down.*

Jewel: "Teresa?!"

Teresa: "Get some rest.. I will tell you on the way." *She lay on her side and used her hands for pillows, trying to ignore the area around her.*

Jewel: "On the way?"

Teresa: "I may be weak, but I can still sense that unimaginable power located far to the East."

Jewel: "O-Okay."

Teresa: *She whispered in recollection, triggering images of Ridley's power-up which caused him to win the fight.* (I underestimated you, knowing you would survive my mother's Teresa's Blossom, then I would not have dropped my power afterwards!)

Jewel: (This is horrible.) *She paused and looked down to the ground, dropping to her knees in exhaustion.*

Teresa: (I do not know what I am going to do. I feel very...) *She hissed at herself in thought and angrily closed her eyes, causing a tear to run down her cheek.* (Lonely.)

*Jewel slowly and quietly fell into a slumber, ignoring the eerie howls caused by the wind outside.*

Teresa: *She listened to the wind blow through the cracks in the walls around her.* (Everyone.. Please be safe-) *She thought in exhaustion, slowly falling into a deep sleep.*

----------

*The party rested in single bunk beds along the walls of a thin cabin-like room.*

Holland: *He scratched Freya behind the ears, listening to her growl in her sleep.* (That dinner of seafood was surprisingly amazing.)

PKMY: (Go to sleep, your thoughts are driving me crazy.)

Holland: *He looked up to the bed above him, slightly startled.* (Sorry, Amy. Sweet dreams.)

PKMY: *She rolled to her side, facing the wall with a smile.* (Wateva.)

Holland: *He looked to the other side of the cabin, watching each party member sleep in different positions.* (Night everyone.) *He smiled and closed his eyes.*

----------

*Pickles and Brazza sat on the edge of a cliff, looking up to the stars.*

Pickles: "They were pretty strong, but what do you think happened?" *She kicked her legs and looked down to the waves, watching the water glitter in the moon's light.*

Brazza: "Their eyes faded." *He shrugged his shoulders in confusion.*

Pickles: "I've never heard of Scoldrants with the yellow eyes to suddenly fade away..." *She whispered to herself in a curious manner.*

Brazza: "Hmph." *He mumbled in a deep voice and placed his hands on the ground behind him, leaning back in a casual manner.*

Pickles: "Tomorrow, hey?" *She glanced at Brazza, exhaling smoke-like mist.*

Brazza: "Yeah." *He chuckled, looking at Pickles.* "Thanks for the past few days."

Pickles: "Eh?"

Brazza: "You weren't boring."

Pickles: *She smiled in response.* "And you weren't annoying."

Brazza: "Annoying?"

Pickles: "Yeah, like, saying stupid stuff."

Brazza: "Stupid stuff?"

Pickles: *She nodded her head, looking back up to the stars.* "For example, pointing out the obvious."

Brazza: "Pointing out the obvious-?"

Pickles: *She chuckled in realisation, rolling her eyes at Brazza.* "Naice."

Brazza: "Hehe." *He leant back and yawned, lying on the ground.* "I'm off to bed, catchya."

Pickles: *She looked back and stared at Brazza, listening to his snores.* (That was fast.)

Brazza: "Zzzz."

Pickles: (I better get some sleep, too.) *She lay next to Brazza, closing her eyes.*

----------

Celest: *She stepped into a room, noticing several mattresses on the floor.* (This must be where we enter the Diareamer state.)

Arcadia: *She appeared behind Celest, pointing towards the closest mattress.* "Please lay down, thy can instantly prepare the dream."

Celest: "Excellent." *She elegantly sat down and laid back on the mattress, crossing her arms over her chest while staring at the roof.*

Arcadia: "Close your eyes." *She appeared next to the mattress and looked down, noticing Celest's uncomfortable facial expression.* "Now, relax your body."

Celest: "Yes."

Arcadia: *She closed her eyes and focused on her breathing which synchronised with Celest's.* (Finding Radiatons is easy on the continent.)

Celest: (Time to enter the unknown-)

----------

*Lance, Alicia and Freya stood in a defensive line in the middle of a vacant field, facing a large dragon-like Scoldrant.*

Dragon: *It looked down, staring at Lance, Alicia and Freya.* "You dare attack me?"

Lance: "We need the sacred jewel in order to open the gates to The Cave of Flounders-" *He shouted as if he was reading from a script.*

Alicia: "We've already got the majestic Javelin of Twinkie!"

Freya: *She nodded her head, enthusiastically wagging her tail for emphasis.* "We just need the jewel!"

Lance: *He enthusiastically swayed his arm to the side.* "Without either, we have no chance of opening the gates to The Cave of Flounders-"

Freya: "And if we can't, then we'll have no hope against Doctor Oogie Boogie 'O Fooey."

Lance: "Shhh! You're not allowed to mention the name, Doctor Oogie Boogie 'O Fooey."

Alicia: "You just said it!" *She gasped in disgust.*

Lance: "Oh, snap!" *He grunted, covering his mouth in shock.*
Freya: "Crackle gruff!"

Dragon: "You won't defeat me!"

*Celest and Arcadia warped in the distance covered in a swirl of golden light.*

Freya: "Alright, we can do this!"

Lance: "Yea!"

Alicia: "We can do this!"

Lance: "Let's do this!"

Freya: "Woof!"

Lance: "I understand! Now let's stare at the foe with intense faces!"

Alicia: "R-Right!" *She smiled and intensely stared at the dragon, giving the illusion she needed to go to the bathroom.*

Lance: "Harh!" *He pushed open his eyelids with his fingers.* "Haharh!"

Freya: "Take this." *She stuck her tongue out and glared at the dragon.*

Dragon: "No! I'm melting! Your stares are too powerful for me!"

Lance: "That's right, cue the victory theme fellow friends!"

Alicia: "Yay!" *She watched the dragon melt into water.* "We did it!"

*Loud music suddenly started to play out of nowhere.*

Celest: *She watched Lance, Alicia and Freya dance like children.* "What a very strange dream, Aliciana?" *She whispered to herself, walking towards them in a professional manner.*

Arcadia: "What an unusual dream?" *She looked around, observing the area in confusion.*

Celest: "Even thou agree?" *She spoke to Arcadia without losing her sight on Alicia.*

Arcadia: "Thy've been in many, but never have thy seen such an unusual and comical fight."

Lance: *He finished his dance and looked to the side, noticing Celest and Arcadia walking towards him.* "Yes, the dragon has been slain, there's no need to thank us-"

Celest: "Silence, we are not here for thou."

Lance: "Loyal subjects, that's no way to talk to your saviour-"

Arcadia: "Thou are merely a dream." *She glared at Lance with no respect.*

Celest: "Aliciana, we need to discuss what we spoke about earlier."

Alicia: "About what?"

Lance: "Actually, you can thank us! Harhar." *He spoke loudly, causing Arcadia's eye to twitch.*

Arcadia: "Thou nuisance." *She waved her arm and looked at Lance in shock.*

Celest: "Enough games-"

Arcadia: *She looked at her hand, then back to Lance in confusion.* "Celest, this is not Alicia's dream."

Celest: "Thou were mistaken?" *She sounded shocked and annoyed, looking back to Arcadia.*

Arcadia: "Well, thy traced the Radiatons in her pendant."

Celest: "Tssk, do not be lazy next time!"

Arcadia: "Thy apologise to the mistress for my error-"

Lance: "Wait-" *He coughed and started to act serious, feeling the pendant under his shirt.* "What's goin' on?"

Arcadia: *She closed her eyes, nodding her head in confirmation.* "She is close, take my hand." *She opened her eyes and looked at Celest, reaching out in an apologetic manner.*

Celest: "Don't be mistaken this time." *She spoke in a stern manner and stormed in front of Arcadia, grabbing her hand.*

Lance: (She's completely ignorin' me-) "Oi!-" *He quickly grabbed Arcadia's shoulder, trying to grab her attention.*

Arcadia: "No!-"

*Celest, Arcadia and Lance faded in a swirl of golden light.*

----------

Alicia: *She sat on a large rock in a grassy clearing, surrounded by thick trees.* (This is beautiful-) *She kicked her feet and smiled, basking in the warm sunlight.*

*Celest, Arcadia and Lance suddenly appeared in a swirl of golden light in front of Alicia, catching her attention.*

Alicia: "H-Huh? Lance, Celest, Arcadia, what are you three doing here?"

Arcadia: *She looked at her shoulder and hit Lance's hand away, facing him with a frown.* "Thy will send thou back-"

Alicia: "Lance!" *She smiled and jumped off the rock.* "I knew you'd come." *She skipped up and hugged him tightly.*

Celest: *She noticed Alicia's happiness, causing her to wave her arm at Arcadia.* "Do not bother, Arcadia."

Arcadia: "Of course?"

Celest: "Please leave us be."

Arcadia: "Yes. Call my name and thy shall awaken thou." *She stepped back and turned around, fading in a swirl of golden light.*

Celest: "Thy understand." *She whispered under her breath, knowing Arcadia could still hear her.*

Alicia: *She stepped away from Lance and smiled, looking at Celest in a curious manner.* "What are you doing here?"

Celest: "Thy'm.. I'm here for two reasons." *Her tone and attitude changed.*

Alicia: "Y-Yes?"

Celest: "During the time you spoke to The Voice of On-"

Alicia: *She gasped in recollection, stepping forward in a worried manner.* "How is The Imperial Glacial Castle-?"

Celest: "Focus!"

Alicia: *She looked away in shock.* "S-Sorry-"

Lance: "Hey, there's no need to yell-"

Celest: "Silence!"

Lance: *Celest's yell triggered a flashback of when she grabbed him by the scruff on The Divine Path.* "Sorry."

Celest: "The mistress told me what you spoke to The Voice of On about."

Alicia: "How-?"

Celest: "So, what is your answer?"

Alicia: *She inhaled deeply and nervously gulped.* (I'm suddenly nervous-)

Lance: "Aye?" *He looked confused, as if he didn't know what they were talking about.*

Alicia: *She bit her bottom lip, placing a hand on her chest.* (I feel sick..-)

Celest: "Aliciana, your answer?"

Lance: "Wat answer?"

Celest: "It does not concern you." *She hissed with impatience at Lance, focusing her attention back on Alicia.* "So, what is your answer?"

Alicia: "To give up my attachments-" *She looked at Lance and paused, shaking her head with emotion.* "I won't give up my love for Lance."

Lance: (Give up? Attachments?) *He grunted in thought, staring at Alicia in a mature manner.*

Celest: "You're willing to sacrifice your power, for a love with this mortal? This lowly peasant?"

Lance: "..."

Celest: "Do you understand the choice you're making!?" *She yelled in an urgent manner, emphasising the severity of her decision.*

Alicia: "I-" *She gasped and looked down to her feet with quivering lips.*

Celest: "Do you?!"

Alicia: "Y-Yes!"

Celest: "You've been given the marking of a Sacred Knight!-" *She shouted as if she was displeased, swaying her arm across Alicia's head.* "Are you sure that's your final decision?"

Alicia: *Her eyes shined gold and an 'S'-shaped tattoo appeared on her forehead.* "Yes-"

Lance: "-No."

Celest: "Hmm?" *She looked intrigued, glancing at Lance in the corner of her eye.* (What did this fool say?)

Alicia: "Lance, you don't understand what's happening."

Lance: "No, I don't really." *He faced Celest and looked at Alicia.* "If I'm wrong, lemme know-"

Alicia: "Lance, don't-"

Lance: *He ignored Alicia and licked his lips, looking down to his feet.* "You've been given an option to become a knight thingy, but at the cost of losin' me?"

Alicia: "No-"

Celest: "Yes."

Lance: "Then, do it."

Alicia: *She tightened her hands and formed fists.* "But-"

Lance: "No buts, just do it."

Alicia: "It took me a long time of deciding... I-I've already made up my mind-"

Lance: "Alicia-"

Alicia: "W-Why are you willing to throw us away?" *She looked up at Lance, frowning out of character.*

Lance: *He looked at Alicia with certainty and sadness.* "'Cause, I'm not worth it."

Alicia: *Her eyes started to water.* "Yes, you are-"

Lance: "No."

Alicia: "Why?"

Lance: "Sometimes when you really love someone, you have to put them before yourself.."

Alicia: "Lance.."

Lance: *He silently walked up to Alicia and closed his eyes, causing a tear to run down his cheek.* "I love you."

Alicia: "I love you too."

Lance: "I love you so freakin' much, but you can do so much more without me."

Alicia: "I know I'm timid, I know I nervously stutter, I know I'm not strong like PKMY or Teresa, but I know that I value my views, my own voice, my own decisions and I will not sway my resolve just because you said so."

Lance: "It's not only your beauty that attracts me to you, it's the unimaginable light that shines inside of you, I've watched you heal cuts, bruises, burns, grazes 'n' other stuff, seen you warm up the room, brighten up everyone's mood, there is so much more you can do, aye.. I know you'll make the right choice." *His lips quivered as if he regretted what he said.*

Alicia: *She sniffed and stepped back, looking at Celest.* "Celest."

Celest: *She stared at Lance in shock, unintentionally ignoring Alicia.* (This boy, he always surprises me with his random antics. He acts childish in Valhalla, but then he acts like this-)

Alicia: "C-Celest."

Celest: *She quickly shook her head, hiding her surprised reaction.* "Yes?"

Alicia: "I want to stick with my decision."

Lance: "W-Wait, wat?! I just said-"

Alicia: "I won't give you up for anything, not even for you." *She inhaled deeply, holding his hand.*

Lance: (Alicia, man..)

Celest: "If that is your answer-" *She took several intimidating steps towards her.*

Alicia: *She closed her eyes, nodding her head.* "I understand-"

Celest: "Then, I welcome you, as a Sacred Knight of Valhalla."

Alicia: *She opened her eyes with a gasp.* "W-What?"
Lance: "A-Aye?" *He stuttered in confusion, looking at Celest with a dropping jaw.*

Celest: "You chose the correct answer. You made the right choice."

Alicia: "I don't understand."

Lance: "M-Me neither?" *He looked at Celest in a dumbfounded manner.*

Celest: "If you were willing to throw away love then you were no way worthy to wield the powers of a Sacred Knight."

Alicia: *She looked at Lance with a victorious smile.* "Too bad this is a dream?" *She reached up, wiping the tears off his face.*

Lance: "Yea, sure." *He smirked and sniffed, wiping the tears around her eyes.*

Celest: "But, there is another thing."

Alicia: "Yes?"

Celest: "There is no choice in what I'm about to tell you."

Alicia: "W-What is it?"

Celest: "You are required to help our fellow Sacred Knights."

Alicia: "Umm, yes, of course."

Celest: "Excellent, you will be immediately-"

Lance: "Immediately?"

Alicia: "B-But I need to help my friends fight the Consultant."

Celest: *She shook her head.* "My sympathies, you're needed elsewhere."

Lance: "But she's been travellin' with us from the start! We've almost finished our-"

Celest: *She ignored Lance and stared at Alicia.* "Please prepare yourself, I'll retrieve you momentarily after awakening."

Alicia: "But-" *She looked down and nodded her head.* "I understand." *She looked at Lance, knowing they'll be parting.* "You've got Lezard in the party."

Lance: *He hesitantly nodded his head in understanding.* "Alright." *He grunted.*

Celest: *She looked up, speaking in thought.* (Arcadia.)

Alicia: "..."

Celest: *She looked down, proudly smiling at Alicia.* "I will see you shortly-"

Lance: "Before you teleport away or wateva. Wat would've happened if Alicia decided to listen to me?"

Celest: "Humph-" *She faded in a swirl of golden light.*

Lance: "Well, apparently you would've humph'd or somethin'." *He gave Alicia and strange look.*

Alicia: "Tee hee." *She smiled and hugged him.* "Thank you."

Lance: *He smiled, kissing Alicia on the head.* (I'll always protect you-)

----------

Lance: *He snored with his mouth open, inappropriately rubbing the pillow.* "Alicia-"

*Footsteps creaked loudly in the ceiling from outside the cabin, waking Lance up with a snort.*

Lance: "Hmm." *He moaned and rolled to the side, causing him to roll off the bunk bed.* "Argh!"

Alicia: *A loud thump caused by Lance suddenly woke her up with a twitch of fright.* "L-Lance?" *She spoke under her breath, rubbing her eyes in confusion.*

Lance: "Tssk-" *He leant up, holding the side of his head in pain.* "Gah, that hurt-"

Alicia: *She yawned and stretched, glancing at Lance.* "Are you okay?"

Lance: "Yea, I was totally meant to do that. You know what they say, best way to start your day is by gettin' the sheets outta ya way." *He looked around and noticed the vacant beds in the cabin.*

Alicia: "Tee hee, good." *She rested the back of her hands on the pillow and looked up to the roof, noticing slight lines of light shining through them.*

Lance: "Looks like everyone's already up, aye." *He stood up and offered his hand to help Alicia out of bed.*

Alicia: "Yep." *She smiled in gratitude and reached for his hand.*

Lance: "Let's say our goodbyes before Celest gets you?"

Alicia: *She looked slightly surprised, as if she wasn't sure he knew about her dream.* "Y-Yes."

*Lance and Alicia pushed open a thick wooden door and was blinded by bright sunlight.*

Holland: "Ah, look who's finally awake."

Freya: "Ruff!" *She barked in agreement, wagging her tail.*

Lance: *He squinted his eyes and noticed the scattered party.* "How come none of yas woke us up?"

Lezard: "You were sound asleep." *He looked at Cameron and Tyler who stood next to him with a smile.*

Season: *He stood by himself at the tip of the ship, staring out into the distance.* (I can see the island now..)

Alicia: "I feel great, how does everyone else feel?"

PKMY: "Already checked, everyone is at maximum capacity." *She proudly and happily announced, punching into her hand.*

Tyler: *He quickly ran to the side of the ship and leant over the rail.* "Argh."

Lance: *He looked at Tyler with a slightly tired expression on his face.* "Pretendin' to be a pirate, Tyler?"

Alicia: "Tee hee."

Cameron: "He has fallen ill due to motion sickness."

Alicia: "I can heal-"

Lezard: "Don't bother, little checkers, already tried."

Cameron: "Little checkers?"

Lance: *He rubbed Alicia's shoulder and smiled at her, holding her hand in a loving manner.* "Do you want to let everyone know-?"

Alicia: "Y-Yep-" *She nodded her head and paused.* "What are you going to do?"

Lance: *He glanced over to Season, noticing he stood by himself.* "I'm gonna to see wat's up with the big guy, aye."

Alicia: "Okay." *She smiled and let go of Lance's hand, walking towards Lezard and Cameron.*

PKMY: *She walked up to Alicia with Holland.* "So, when did this happen?"

Alicia: "Sorry-?"

PKMY: "Ahem."

Alicia: "I mean, what?"

PKMY: "About Celest going to get you."

Alicia: "How did you know?"

Holland: "Still asking that?"

Alicia: *She looked down and giggled in realisation.* "Umm."

Lezard: "Oh no, are you leaving us?"

Tyler: *He turned around with a sickly appearing face.* "Where, when, how?"

Holland: "But we're about to confront the Consultant."

Alicia: "I know, but as a Sacred Knight, I'm needed somewhere else."

Tyler: (Sacred Knight?)

Cameron: "A Sacred Knight-?"

Lance: "Oi-" *He walked up to Season.*

Season: "Oh, Lance-" *He looked over his shoulder, watching Lance walk up to him.* "What brings you here?"

Lance: *He looked behind him and scanned across the deck.* "Well, it's a big ship, but it's not like I went out of my way to get here."

Season: "Oh, hohoho." *He chuckled and shook his head at Lance, focusing his attention back to the island in the distance.* "I'm scared, Lance."

Lance: "Wat?" *He grunted in disbelief.* (I wasn't expectin' that-)

Season: "When I fought him at Surpreon, his power was frightening."

Lance: "I'm nervous too, aye.. I don't know wat's goin' to happen."

Season: "If anything happens-" *He faced Lance and looked serious.* "It's been a pleasure becoming friends with you."

Lance: "I-I, yeah." *He spoke and smiled in a mature manner.* "We'll get through this together-"

Whitehead: *He hobbled across the upper deck and stared at the party in an urgent manner.* "Bad news!" *He yelled at everyone, instantly catching their attention.*

Cameron: "What is it?"

PKMY: "Eh?" *She looked up to Whitehead in a worried manner.*

Whitehead: "Up ahead, something has changed! There are unusual rock formations in the water."

Tyler: "I don't see how rocks would be a threat, the exterior looked like it was very sturdy."

Whitehead: "Not even the mighty Sheridan can stand a chance against those unusual rocks, argh."

Cameron: "How exactly can the land change so easily?"

Season: "What rocks is he talking about?" *He mumbled to himself, catching Lance's attention.*

Lance: *He glanced at Season and looked over the ship, observing the ocean's surface.* "I don't see any rocks?!"

Whitehead: "Are you blinded by the water's current? It's right over!-" *He pointed out to the ocean and gasped with widening eyes.* "Th-They're gone?!"

Lance: "Maybe you're sick like Tyler, too?"

PKMY: "Heh." *She smirked and folded her arms.*

*A heartbeat-like pulse caused Holland, Freya and Cameron to gasp in shock.*

Holland: "What is that?"

PKMY: (Are you in pain?)

Holland: "No-"

Apollo: (Cameron, that feeling! It's!-) *His voice shouted with an echo in Cameron's mind.*

Cameron: "An Ancioldrant!"

Lezard: "Wowza?!"

Whitehead: "A what?! Scoldrant?" *He yelled in confusion.*

Lance: "Well, I don't think we have to worry about a mere Scold-"

*A massive brown serpent with rocks for scales erupted up from the water next to the ship.*

Tyler: "No!-" *He gasped and had a flashback.*

--

Joy: "The legend states of a mythical serpent that divides the continents. It's said, that when creatures are brought to bring destruction towards the ocean, it shows itself."

--

Tyler: "The legend-"

Whitehead: "No! We can't let it hurt our Sheridan!"

Season: *He intensely stared at the serpent, running across the deck to Cameron.* (PKMY, ask Cameron and Holland to communicate to the serpent!)

PKMY: *She nodded her head, glancing at Holland.* "Can you communicate to it?!"

Holland: *He nodded his head and faced the serpent, causing the purple ring to spiral around his iris.* (Hear my thoughts-)

Cameron: *He squinted his eyes, focusing on the serpent.* (Stop this madness!-)

Serpent: "Skkeeerarh!" *It screeched, readying to attack the Sheridan.*

Whitehead: "No!"

PKMY: "Wat's the problem?!"

Holland: "It's not letting me through!"

Lezard: (I remember this thing! This isn't good!-)

Cameron: *He gritted his teeth and nodded his head, placing his hand over his shoulder.* "It is consumed with emotion, it is not allowing us to make contact."

Season: *He stopped next to Holland, frowning in desperation.* "Are we to fight it?"

Holland: *He discreetly shook his head, as if he was opposed to the idea.* "..."

Cameron: "We are to damage it to an extent where it will be able to listen to us."

Tyler: "B-But we're meant to be reserving our energy."

PKMY: "Quick finger's right."

Season: "We have no choice."

Tyler: *He glanced at his bag, mumbling in recollection.* (My Ougi uses its own Neurons and Astragons-) *He gasped in realisation, looking at Season with an idea.* "S-Season-"

Season: "Not now, Tyler-"

Tyler: *He ran in front of Season, grabbing his arm.* "I have an idea-"

Serpent: *A blue glyph spiralled in front of its mouth, causing Whitehead's men to shout in terror.* "Skerrrrh!"

Season: "It's about to attack!" *He shouted at Tyler as a yellow glyph materialised under his feet.*

PKMY: *She quickly glanced at Tyler, noticing an aura swirl around him from only her perspective.* "Season, listen to him!"

Season: "Excuse me?" *He glanced at PKMY before focusing his attention on Tyler.*

Tyler: "I-I've wanted to try this for a while.. I'm not even sure if it will work."

Season: "Do you understand this isn't a good-?"

Tyler: *He grabbed Season's hand and focused, causing a swirl of wind to blow around them.* (Focus on the same feeling of my Ougi.)

Season: *He focused his attention back to the serpent and suddenly gasped, looking down to Tyler's hand.* (Are these Astragons?! Words?)

Tyler: (I have no idea what he's feeling-?) *He gasped in shock, causing him to smile in disbelief.*

Season: (These can't be Tyler's, so what are-?!)

PKMY: "Heh, I don't believe it." *She smirked at Tyler and Season, shaking her head in an impressed manner.*

Cameron: "If none of you will attack the Ancioldrant, then you leave me no choice!-"

Tyler and Season: "Hi-Ougi."

Lance: "Wait, wat?"

Season: "How is this possible?!"

Tyler: *He watched the RPG bag float off his shoulder and spiral into the air in front of them.* "It would be one of my greatest privileges to fight alongside you!"

Season: "Tyler-"

Tyler and Season: *They instinctively threw their hands into the RPG bag, causing strings of white fluoro liquid to spiral up their arms.* "Mastered state of Alchemy and Crafting-"

Serpent: "BUBBLE BLAST" *It spat out slow-moving bubbles towards the ship, causing Whitehead to grunt in terror.*

Whitehead: "It may be slow! But that'll destroy Sheridan's integrity, argh!"

Tyler and Season: "Pour the Neurons and Astragons into Ragnarok's formula-"

Cameron: *He pulled his arm forward, watching sparks spiral around his blue sword.* "Humph-"

Tyler and Season: *They both shouted, causing the white liquid to burst and swirl around their bodies.* "Form and merge into our strongest creation!-"

Lezard: "Holy fishcakes." *He watched the liquid glow and form around their bodies, slowly taking shape of a vehicle.*

Alicia: "W-What is that light?"

Holland: *He watched the light fade, causing him to raise an eyebrow in confusion.* "What is that-?"

Tyler: *He stood on top of a tank, holding a turret with both hands.* (Wow!-)

Lance: "Holy shit! You made a freakin' tank?!"

Season: *He sat inside the tank and placed his hands on two controls, powering the vehicle up.* (It runs by using my Neurons?!)

Cameron: *He glanced behind him and noticed the tank, causing him to lower his sword.* "What kind of Scoldrant is that? I do not detect any life signatures from it-"

Tyler and Season: "Elemental Ragnatank."

Lance: "That's-"

Tyler: *He noticed the bubbles and swivelled the turret, aiming it in front of the serpent.* "Season?"

Season: *He watched the vehicle power-up around his hands, listening to laser-like charging sounds.* "Done."

Tyler and Season: "ICE STREAM DIVIDER" *Tyler fired off cannon-like balls of ice, exploding the bubbles into spheres of ice.*

Lance: "Sick." *He watched the ice fall out of his sight, listening to the water splash below.*

Whitehead: "W-What is that contraption on my Sheridan?!" *He pointed a cutlass sword at the tank-like object in a cautious and curious manner.*

Serpent: "Skrarh!" *It hissed and opened its jaw, causing webbed gills to flap out of its neck.*

Season: *He adjusted his hands, causing the area in the tank to turn yellow.* "Tyler!"

Tyler: "Got it!"

Lance: "Come on, quick fingers! It looks pissed!-"

Tyler and Season: "SPARK CANNON" *Tyler fired off a cannon-like ball of electricity, hitting the serpent on its underside.*

Serpent: "S-S-K-Sk!-" *It hissed in a stutter-like manner, as strings of electricity flashed up its body.*

PKMY: (Direct hit-)

Cameron: *He stepped forward and shouted, trying to grab the serpent's attention.* "Listen to me!-"

Serpent: "Skrarh!" *It hissed in anger, causing a blue glyph to spiral out of its mouth.* "HYDRO CANNON-"

Tyler and Season: "FLAME BOLT" *Tyler fired off a cannon-shaped ball of fire, smashing into the serpent's face, shattering the glyph.*

Lezard: (Remarkable! A Hi-Ougi with the ability to use Remenistal?)

Serpent: *It hissed in pain and leant back, swaying to each side to keep its body above the water.* "AQUA LIQUID-"

Holland: *He looked at Cameron with widening eyes.* "I could hear his thoughts!"

Cameron: *He lowered the sword, nodding his head.* "One more time!"

Season: "Got it! A Grand Rostical!" *He started to shout with concentration, causing the vehicle to overcharge.*

Tyler: *He watched the turret shake, causing him to firmly hold onto it with both hands.* "R-Ready-"

PKMY: "Wat are you waiting for?! Fire!"

Tyler and Season: "SURREAL PULSAR" *Tyler watched a fluoro green ball charge at the end of the turret, catching the party's attention.*

Lezard: (Oh my! Those Neurons are strong!-) *He held onto his hat as a sudden burst of wind blew around the tank.*

Tyler: "We can do this!" *He shouted, aiming the turret at the serpent's head.*

Cameron: "With a powerful energy signature like that, aim for its scales!"

Tyler: "G-Got it-" *He gritted his teeth, slightly lowering the turret away from its face.*

Serpent: *It shook its head and suddenly leant back, readying to attack.* "Skrarh!"

Whitehead: "It's going to ram the Sheridan!-"

Tyler and Season: "Harh!" *They pushed forward and blasted the fluoro ball at the serpent, smashing it into its scales.*

Alicia: *She watched a fluoro mist-like wave explode from the serpent's back, smashing its rocky scales into the air.* "E-Eek-"

Serpent: "Skrarh-" *It swayed to the side, shaking its head in disorientation.*

Apollo: (I hear his thoughts! Make a connection now!)

Cameron: *He nodded his head and sheathed his sword over his shoulder, spreading his arms out.* "Holland, PKMY, hold my hand!"

*PKMY and Holland stepped forward and grabbed Cameron's hand without question.*

Cameron: (We mean no harm, leave this place!)

Serpent: "Skrarh!" *It hissed in shock, focusing its attention on Cameron.* "Thens what is thats abnormal power? It's distractingss."

PKMY: (It's not talking about the Hi-Ougi! It must mean Ridley!)

Cameron: "We are going to stop it!"

Serpent: "I don'ts believe you!"

Holland: "We seriously are!"

Freya: "Gruff!"

Serpent: *It paused as if it was thinking.* "I controls the waters.. If I feels you are the cause to this, I'll crush this thing you sails on!"

Whitehead: (Crush?!) *He mumbled in terror at the thought.*

Holland: "You have our word!" *He yelled in a deep voice, causing PKMY to smile.*

Serpent: "Tsskss-" *Its scales moved and it turned away, slowly descending back into the water.*

Tyler: *He sighed in relief, awkwardly jumping off the turret and onto the deck.* "Th-Th-That was s-scary."

Season: *He stepped through the tank, watching it ripple around him.* (It's like Surpreon's entrance-)

Whitehead: *He shook his head in disbelief, rubbing his beard.* "I don't believe it-"

Lance: "That was by far, the best Owgee thingy out!"

Season: *He smiled at Tyler, shaking his head in amazement.* "That was seriously astonishing, Tyler."

Tyler: *He watched the tank suddenly disintegrate into tiny white orbs, disappearing into the air.* "I-I can't believe it worked."

Season: *He looked at his hands, chuckling in disbelief.* "I haven't lost any Neurons or Astragons?"

Tyler: "Me neither, obviously." *He awkwardly chuckled and bent down, picking up the RPG bag.*

Season: "But, how?"

Tyler: *He adjusted the strap over his shoulder, looking at Season with a proud smile.* "It's the actual weapon."

Lance: "So, just spam the crap outta your new tank?"

Holland: "A tank?"

PKMY: "That's what they call it, I'm pretty sure."

Tyler: *He shook his head, resting one arm on the RPG bag.* "It needs time to recharge.. We might be fine, but, we probably won't be able to do the Hi-Ougi until tomorrow."

Season: "Hmm.. Well, it's a remarkable Hi-Ougi."

Lezard: "It's absolutely scrumptious how The Voice of On does this." *He giggled, wiggling his bottom in a sarcastic manner.*

Alicia: *She looked at Tyler and Season, cupping her pendant in amazement.* "That Hi-Ougi reminded me of the mechanical Scoldrants from your world, Tyler."

Tyler: "Huh?"

Lance: "Aha, cars."

Tyler: "Haha, yeah."

Whitehead: "I thank you for saving our Sheridan, but make sure you take care in what you do, argh!" *He grunted in an annoyed manner, pointing at several scratches on the deck where the tank was.*

Tyler: "S-Sorry."

Season: *He looked at Whitehead, bowing in respect.* "My apologies-"

*The air in the distance warped with an echoing whoosh-like pulse, catching the party's attention.*

PKMY: *She gasped and stared at the warping air, taking several steps towards it.* "Something is happening!"

Season: *He gritted his teeth, looking at PKMY with impatience.* "We need to get there."

PKMY: "Tssk-" *She frowned in agreement.*

Tyler: *He glanced up to Whitehead, adjusting the RPG bag over his shoulder.* "Is there any way we can get the ship to sail faster?"

Whitehead: "Argh, no."

Lezard: "Ooo, this isn't good!" *He sarcastically wailed on the spot.*

Lance: *He looked up as if he had an idea.* "Alicia!"

Alicia: "Huh?" *She looked over to Lance, who was motioning her to come over.* "Yes?" *She ran towards Lance in a feminine manner, listening to her footsteps creak across the deck.*

Lance: "I have an idea, aye."

Alicia: "Y-Yep?" *She looked at Season, who tried to eavesdrop into Lance's plan.*

Lance: "If we can't make the ship go any faster, then we'll just have to do somethin' else."

Alicia: *She tilted her head on the side in confusion.* "Like?"

Lance: "Aha." *He held her hand and focused, causing their pendants to shine.*

Alicia: "Oh-" *She smiled in realisation, causing her to nod her head in agreement.*

Season: "If you've got an idea, Lance, then-"

Lance and Alicia: "Hi-Ougi."

PKMY: "Eh?"
Holland: "Huh?"

Lance and Alicia: "Power of the deep depths, let our power roar like thunder, and shatter like ice, heed our words-" *They closed their eyes at the same time and began to wave their arms in a fluid manner.*

*The light dimmed and darkened, causing Season to notice the sparkling, fluoro water around him.*

Season: (What a fool! I was too busy worrying about moving the ship-)

Lance and Alicia: "ETHEREAL RAPIDS"

Season: (I didn't think of using the actual water-) *He watched large waves push against the ship, causing it to tip upwards.*

Tyler: *He covered his mouth and quickly shuffled towards the rail, leaning over it in a sickly manner.* "Don't feel-, good."

Holland: *He slightly lost his balance, watching the waves unnaturally push themselves against the side of the ship.* "The waves-"

Lezard: "The water-" *He giggled in a sarcastic manner, admiring the white fluoro waves.* "They look powerful but gentle at the same time, kind of like a cupcake."

PKMY: "What?!"

Holland: "Yeah, man. I try not to think about food when I'm going into a fight."

Lezard: "Ooo, I'm sorry."

Holland: "Ha ha, all good."

Bandit: *He held thick ropes which were wrapped around his wrists as if he was steering the ship.* (The stress of the rope-?)

Whitehead: *He held onto an enormous wooden steering wheel, looking at the bandit-like man.* "What are you doing?"

Man: *He gently let go of his grip and watched the ropes fall on to the deck, causing him to look at Whitehead in confusion.* "Boss, I don't need to pull it any more?"

Whitehead: "We've seen many things. But, argh." *He chuckled, keeping the wheel idle.* "These kids, there's something about them."

Bandit: "Boss?"
Grunt: "Argh?"

Season: "We're almost there!" *He smiled, staring in front with boosted morale.* "Lance, Alicia, that's enough, or we might crash the ship on to the land!"

Lance and Alicia: "..." *They slowly exhaled and opened their eyes, causing the area to revert back to normal.*

Season: *He watched the waves settle with anticipation.* (Splendid.)

*Lezard, Cameron, PKMY and Holland ran up to Lance, Alicia and Season.*

Lezard: "Sensational idea, Lance!"

Holland: "Yeah, smart thinking."

PKMY: "Thinking? I hope you didn't hurt yourself?"

Lance: "Aha, funny." *He rolled his eyes with a modest smirk.*

Tyler: *He stood up straight and wiped his mouth, taking a deep breath.* (I'm okay for now-)

*A cluster of white light appeared in the middle of the deck, causing PKMY to backflip away from it.*

Cameron: "Tcch-" *He frowned at the light and stepped back, standing in a battle-ready pose.*

Celest: "Ah-" *She stretched and walked out of the fading light, looking at Alicia.* "It's time to go."

Cameron: "Who are-?"

Alicia: *She sighed and smiled, glancing at each party member.* "Okay, I better go."

Tyler: "U-Umm." *He looked at Alicia as if he was unimpressed she had to leave.*

Season: (Amy was right about Alicia needing to leave.)

PKMY: "I will see you at Surpreon after everything is done." *She walked up to Alicia and gave her a hug.* "Not happy about it, but we understand, so don't feel bad, OK?"

Alicia: "Th-Thank you."

PKMY: "Heh." *She smirked and punched Alicia on the shoulder, taking a step back.*

Holland: "I'll see you soon. We'll have a big feast together." *He smirked and stepped forward, giving her a quick hug.*

Season: "Oh, little one. Stay strong." *He took several steps forward and gave her a hug, rubbing her back with a proud smile.*

Alicia: "I-I will."

Lance: "Oi." *He smiled at Season and took a step forward, looking at Alicia.*

Season: *He looked at Lance, taking several steps back.* "Hohoho, she's all yours."

Lance: *He placed his hands over Alicia's shoulders and tightly hugged her.* "Be careful." *He spoke under his breath and kissed her, hesitantly taking a step back.*

Alicia: "You too, grottom bottom." *She smiled at Lance and started to walk towards Celest.*

Lance: "Aha.." *He smirked in a mature manner, sighing to himself.*

Lezard: "Bye bye." *He waved, shaking his bottom.*

Cameron: *He nodded his head in a professional manner.* "See you."

Tyler: "Ah, bye, Alicia!" *He spoke with a squeal, waving above his head.*

Freya: "Gerooh!"

Holland: "Haha, Freya says bye, too!"

Alicia: "Tee hee-"

Celest: "Pointless antics over?" *She didn't wait for Alicia's response and grabbed her hand, causing white light to swirl around them.*

Alicia: "Good luck, everyone!-"

Celest: "Humph-" *She closed her eyes and they disappeared in a flash of white light.*

Holland: (Talk about sudden.)

Freya: (Yeah!)

Lance: *He sighed again and looked at Whitehead, tapping his foot in an impatient manner.* "How long-?"

*The ship suddenly came to a stop, causing Tyler and Lezard to fall on the deck.*

Whitehead: "Ahoy! Land!"

Season: "Land?" *He quickly looked over the ship and noticed land.* "I hadn't noticed!"

Lance: "Me 'n' Alicia are amazin', how didn't ya notice?"

Cameron: *He stretched his shoulder and adjusted his armour, quickly hopping onto the rail of the ship.* "Now the time, the moment I have been waiting for-"

*Cameron tapped his foot and jumped high into the air, landing on the island with ease.*

Whitehead: "Hmm?" *He noticed the water pulling the ship back.* "You better go! There's an unnatural rip pulling us back in, argh!"

Man: "It might be that serpent, boss?"

Whitehead: "Maybe.."

Season: "Come on, everyone!-"

Holland: *He jumped on the rail and looked behind to Tyler and Lezard.* (They're struggling-) "Freya, help them out!"

Freya: "Ruff!" *She jumped off PKMY's shoulder and flapped her wings, as her body grew in size.*

Lance: *He grunted and jumped off the ship, landing next to Cameron.* "There."

PKMY: *She sprinted off the ship and spiralled in the air, elegantly landing on one foot.* "Heh-"

Season: *He looked down, watching the waves crash around the boat.* "That's a long drop-"

Lance: "You OK, Season?" *He spoke with a sincere tone as if he wanted to help.*

*Freya glided next to Lezard and Tyler, causing them to grab hold of her.*

Lezard: "Wowza! You're double the size of us!"

Freya: "Grarf!"

Lezard: "You may want to lay off those biscuits-"

Freya: "Grr."

Season: *A wave of water suddenly erupted underneath him and swept him off his feet.* "Hmm?" *He looked at Lance and smiled, as the water gently lowered him on to the ground.* "Why, yes."

Lance: "Aha, show off."

Freya: *She flapped her wings and carried Lezard and Tyler on her back across the deck.* (They're heavier than they look-) *She glided down next to the party and lowered herself, landing on the ground.*

Lezard: "Thankies, little Scoldrant."

Tyler: "Thanks, Freya-" *He looked at Holland, adjusting his RPG bag.* "And, Holland."

Holland: "You're welcome."
Freya: "Gruff!"

*Warp-like sounds echoed like thunder in the distance, causing the party to gasp in confusion.*

Cameron: "Hmm?" *He looked to his side with interest.*

Lezard: "The sounds drew the party's attention to an obvious Spacial Funnel, which warped in the air."

PKMY: "You're seriously still doing that, right to the end-?"

Season: "There he is!" *He pointed ahead in shock, staring at a small figure in the distance.*

Lance: *He took a deep breath, shaking his hands with anticipation.* "I'm ready."

Tyler: *He gulped and silently nodded his head.* (Ridley, you'll pay for what you did to my friends.)

PKMY: "Wat are we waiting for?!" *She grunted with growing impatience and nervousness.*

Lance: "I rekon." *He glanced at the party and stepped forward, running towards the Spacial Funnel.*

Lezard: "Lezard can't really see that far, what is the Consultant doing?"

Holland: *The purple ring around his iris rotated, magnifying his vision.* "His back is facing us, he seems to be concentrating on the gate in front of him."

Season: (A gate?)

Lezard: *He watched the party run directly towards Ridley, causing him to quickly follow.* "Wait for me! Jinkies."

PKMY: *She observed the warped air in front of Ridley, noticing glyphic-like markings around the Spacial Funnel.* (What are those glyphic formulas?)

----------

Sofia: "So, what game would you like to play first?" *She giggled in an evil-like manner, licking her lips.*

Cassidy: "No games, we're here to defeat you!"

Lorilei: "You helped the Consultant's wicked plans!"

Sofia: "Hahehahe." *She covered her mouth, giggling in reaction.* "Umm, well, let's see who gets a game over first?" *Her cold silver eyes stared at Cassidy and Lorilei.*

Cassidy: "Those eyes give me the freaks!" *He mumbled to himself, keeping a brave face.*

----------

*The party ran up to Ridley, who continued his fixated stare on the Spacial Funnel.*

Ridley: "Oh dear-" *He lowered his arms and faced the party.* "Well, isn't this a fantastic reunion?" *He smiled and clapped his hands once.*

Season: "The suffering ends here!"

Ridley: "Suffering?"

Lance: *He gritted his teeth and watched the Spacial Funnel fluctuate, noticing a blurred image start to form itself inside.* (It's like a portal, or a doorway-)

PKMY: "I can't forgive how you used our mother as a puppet!"

Holland: "I can't forgive you for causing Scoldrants to be feared."

Ridley: "Oh? But Scoldrants have always been feared-"

Holland: "The harmless ones get killed because of the fear that was stigmatised on them!"

Ridley: "Big words for a Scoldrant User-"

Holland: "Shut up!"

Lezard: "My parents, you manipulated both!"

Cameron: "I was a mere tool to you, and once I failed to be of use, you sent someone to kill me!"

Lance: "If it wasn't for you, Ash.. If you didn't send Zayden, he'd still be alive!-" *He formed fists and grunted in anger.*

Ridley: *He glanced at each party member with a smile.* "Tyler? Would you like to have a heartwarming speech too?"

Tyler: "B-Be quiet!"

Ridley: "Well, could we not fight?"

Lance: "Don't wanna fight 'cause you're outnumbered?"

Ridley: "Oh, well you're not wrong, I am outnumbered-"

PKMY: "Shut it-"

Lance: "You dirty shit." *He frowned with anger, causing his face to wrinkle.*

Ridley: "If you insist to fight, then I'll just have to kill you all." *He took a step closer to the party, staring at them with a fading smile.*

Michael: "Wow, you've just finished the sixth part of the series! Thank you very much for reading! Without you, our heroes wouldn't have the incentive to continue on with their adventure! I hope you continue on and join us for the final part of The Rostical Users!"

*Michael giggled and continued to type with a widening smile.*

Michael: "If you thought this was a delicious adventure, or Neurons forbid, a poopy story, please give us a rating and review, it'll help others find our adventure! And.. Thank you again!"

*Michael stopped typing and glanced at the screen, pictured looking at you, yes you! The reader.*

Michael: "So, our heroes can't teleport anymore, the destruction of Surpreon, Alicia not taking part in the final battle-?!"

Lezard: "Lezard doesn't care for any of that, did you see Lezard's guild at work?? Little monster with his awesome dance moves, Razzypoo with her epic ground mastery, Nathapoo with his swordsmanship, Loonzamotto-"

Michael: "Okay, firstly, our amazing readers probably aren't familiar with the nicknames, secondly, they're reading The Rostical Users, they don't need to have the guild shoved down their throats all the time, and lastly, you don't care for any of that?!"

Lezard: "Wowza, stop being so dramatic! This upsets Lezard! He has to fight the final villain, you know?"

Michael: "Ahem! If you have any delicious questions, feel free to email me here. I'm also on Facebook and Twitter! I find any feedback scrumptious and I will always reply back.
Hope to hear from you, little silly sausage!"
