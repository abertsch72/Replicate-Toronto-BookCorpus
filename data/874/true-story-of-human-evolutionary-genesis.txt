You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something—your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.

- Steve Jobs, Stanford commencement speech, June 2005



The Earth-centered Universe of Aristotle and Ptolemy held sway on Western thinking for almost 2000 years. Then, in the 16th century a new idea was proposed by the Polish astronomer Nicolai Coperni- cus (1473-1543).
Long before that, Aristarchus (310 - 230 B.C.) figured out how to measure the distances to and sizes of the Sun and the Moon. Be- cause he deduced that the Sun was so much bigger than the moon, he concluded that the Earth must therefore revolve around the Sun.
Even after Copernicus's revolutionary theory, most scientists re- fused to accept this theory for many decades. When Galileo made his case with his telescope, the scientific community was still reluc- tant to take the new findings into the main stream.
It’s foolish to deem the objections and rejections of the scientific community at that time as merely theological. Observational evi- dence supported a more plausible and convincing competing cos- mology--the "geohelocentrism" of Tycho Brahe (1546-1601), who made important contributions by devising the most precise instru- ments available before the invention of the telescope.
Today, the Sitchin paradigm shift faces similar challenges.

Introduction




It is my sincere hope that everyone who reads this work will be in- spired to question things and to search out these and other new truths and discoveries for themselves.
We should all be engaged in the most important intellectual di- alog, exchange, and sharing of the twenty-first century.
I do not ask or expect anyone to blindly believe what is written within the pages of this book without investigating all the evidence for themselves. In the quest for truth, all our shutters will be opened onto a brave new world, as if seeing with new eyes life and society in all its splendor and glory with an ever greater sensitivity and re- alization.
Remember, with Truth, sometimes it is stranger than fiction, sometimes it is vastly outnumbered, sometimes it is out there some- where, and sometimes it lies in our inner awakening.
I hope the investigations, interchanges, and interactions that sur- round the greatest discovery and controversy that pertain to the findings in the Sumerian clay tablets will eventually unite us in a beautiful harmony called love. In our quest for the ultimate Truth, we shall progress and usher in the Golden Age.
I thank you in advance for taking time to read my book and using it as a thought-provoking work.

Part 1

Lost Book of Enki


Part 1 is a rewritten account of
The Lost Book of Enki by Zecharia Sitchin




Some four hundred and forty-five thousand years ago, humanoid aliens called Anunnakis came to Earth to mine gold to heal their at- mosphere and save their planet, Nibiru. To this end they built a full- fledged Mission Earth—with a mission control center, a spaceport, mining operations, and even a way station on Mars. King Anu and the Council on Nibiru were desperate for more miners and decreed their eminent geneticist, Enki, to employ Anunnakis’ advance ge- netic engineering to fashion a race of primitive workers. Through a series of blunders, the perfect slave race, intelligent and subservient prototype, Homo sapiens, was created.
The Homo sapiens multiplied in great numbers. Enhanced hy- brids were begotten through gradual intermarrying of the descen- dants of Anunnakis and humans. The deluge in Noah’s times that catastrophically swept over the earth wiped out most of the settle- ments. The Anunnakis posed themselves as gods, granting mankind civilization, social hierarchy, domesticated animals, and plants. They also taught mankind astronomy, mathematics, science, laws, architecture, metallurgy, agriculture etc etc . . . Then about four thousand years ago, internal rivalries among the Anunnaki prompted different factions in the Anunnakis to nuke each other. Most of them returned to Nibiru after the event.
The planet Nibiru is a big planet, sultry and vivacious. It looks like a massive brown dwarf star, which glows in the infrared band, and would have appeared to be on fire to ancient Earth witnesses. Incapacitated, Earth scientists have concluded that there could be

no life on Nibiru. But there is life on Nibiru—life that should resem- ble ours, but doesn’t. At a time of the darkest moment in their his- tory, the inhabitants of Nibiru, the Anunnaki, led desperate lives, suffering from great and terrible need. They began to search the uni- verse in an effort to gratify that need. They sought a planet on which life is healthy, vibrant, and strong. They needed finest gold particles broken down and manufactured with nanotechnology to heal their atmosphere. They needed miners to do their work, to labor and slave for them, to manufacture their golden dreams. The Anunnaki needed slaves, and they had chosen the planet on which their slaves would be created after carrying out their sophisticated and high tech genetic experiment and foolproof feasibility study. Part 1 is the story of their presence on earth around B.C. 450,100.

Chapter One
The Debate for the Anunnaki and Ape Hybrids
B.C. 450,100.




In the Court of King Anu, Planet Nibiru, the important issue of primitive workers on Colony Earth was raised. All the elders, wise men, savants, gifted, prodigies, clairvoyants, famous, scientists, leaders, commanders, explorers, entrepreneurs, and people’s rep- resentatives were gathered in the assembly for a long and bitter re- lated discussion on morality, labor laws, enslavement mandates, interplanetary journey stipulations, and Planet Nibiru’s atmospheric conditions.
The central issue was: Should primitive workers be genetically engineered and created to solve the astronauts’ labor dispute and possible mutiny?
Major proponents were led by Enki, second commander of Ter- ran Operations.
“Make Homo erectus more intelligent by changing them into Homo sapiens. Our commands he will then understand. Our tools he will then handle. He shall perform the toil in the excavations. We will have no more labor disputes coming from our astronauts work- ing as gold miners.”
“It is not a new creature created by us. The plan is to give this ape creature that we found on Earth more ability, make them more to our likeness. Only a tiny segment of our DNA is all that is needed.”
Opponents were led by Enlil, supreme commander of Terran
Operations.
“Technological improvements in production methods, toolmak-
ing, and machinery would make a better choice. Anunnaki should
not play God by creating slave beings!”

“Creation is the power held by the Father of All Beginnings, not Anunnaki. We are sent to Earth to obtain gold to repair Nibiru’s dwindling atmosphere, not to replace the Father of All Beginnings.” There was no verdict after many days of intense debate and de- liberation. On the seventh day, the Supreme Council of King Anu
reconvened for the seventh time.
“Can we get the finest gold dusts in the galaxy in any other way?
Our Planet Nibiru is dying. The survival of the glorious Anunnaki
civilization  hangs  in  the  balance.  We  must  get  gold  to  repair
Nibiru’s broken ozone. We must get the finest gold dusts in the
galaxy at all costs.”
“Let us forget about interplanetary travel rules and save Nibiru.
If there is no Planet Nibiru, there will be no Anunnaki civilization.
If there is no Anunnaki civilization, there is no need for interplane-
tary travel rules.”
“Let us save Nibiru by the creation of slave workers through
high tech genetic engineering!”

Chapter Two
The Story of the Garden of Eden, Prehistoric Iraq
B.C. 450,100.




Enki, second commander of Terran Operations, was rocketed to Earth with fifty medics, six hundred miners, three hundred astro- nauts, and a hundred administrators.
So the Anunnaki came to the earth around four hundred and fifty thousand years ago to mine gold in what is now Africa. The main mining center was in today’s Zimbabwe, an area the Sumeri- ans called AB.ZU (deep deposit). The gold mined by the Anunnaki was shipped back to their home planet from bases in the Middle East.
At first, the gold mining was done by the intelligent and physi- cally robust Anunnaki astronauts and miners. These men were of the respectable elite back home. However, they were made to toil and work as miners on Earth in order to save Nibiru. Eventually, there were riots and rebellions, and the Anunnaki royal leadership decided to create a new slave race to do the work.

Chapter Three
Terran Wildlife Natural Reserve and Research Center
Garden of Edin, Prehistoric Iraq




Enki and his son Ningizidda led a team of biologists to set up a lab for Earth animal studies. Special interest was given especially to Homo erectus, a species Enki identified as due to evolve in a few million years into Homo sapiens, the species like the Nibirans.
The apes kept at the reserve were studied carefully by the Anun- naki. Found in the African forests, the apes walked erect on two legs. Their forelegs they used as arms. They lived among the animals of the steppe. They ate plants with their mouths. They drrank water from lakes and ditches. It was a thrill to see them alive! They were kept in strong cages. At the sight of visitors, they jumped up with fists beating on the cage bars, grunting and snorting and speaking no words. Just like the Anunnaki, they had males and females!
The study of Homo erectus revealed that just like the chim- panzees, gorillas, and orangutans, they had twenty-four pairs of chromosomes. Ningishzidda, president of the Biogenetics Council, explained to Ninmah, the chief medical officer, how the second and third chromosomes of Homo erectus could be fused together to give rise to the intelligent new ape. This fusion could only be accom- plished in the Terran genetic splicing laboratory through manipu- lation of the egg. No disease or natural genetic condition had ever caused a species to alter its chromosomal structure!
(*All members of Hominidae except humans have twenty-four pairs of chromosomes. Humans have only twenty-three pairs of chromosomes. Human chromosome 2 is widely accepted to be a re- sult of an end-to-end fusion of two ancestral chromosomes. Wikipedia.)

The True Story of Human Evolutionary Genesis

To the astonished Ninmah, Ningishzidda continued, “There are things that we can do now that surpass your wildest dreams. We can jump the gun on the new ape’s progress, and make it into Homo sapiens through infusion of some Anunnaki gene segments!”
“Oh, Homo erectus! They are too odd, too monstrous, and too barbaric!”
“That is why you are needed for their perfection into Homo sapiens!”
Enki, second commander of Terran Operations, said to Ninmah and Ningishzidda, “Gather your teams and start working!”




Footnote
In Inside the Human Genome: A Case for Non-Intelligent Design by John C. Avise, the author argues that from the perspectives of bio- chemistry and molecular genetics there are numerous flaws that exist in the biological world. There is overwhelming scientific evi- dence for genomic imperfection, imperfections that extend deep down to the level of our genes, and evidence also exists that there are many gross deficiencies in human DNA, ranging from muta- tional defects to built-in design faults.
The oversimplified and often touted claim that the DNA of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and humans (Homo sapiens) are about ninety-eight percent similar, a claim made by Oxford profes- sor Richard Dawkins and other evolution proponents, can be re- futed by genomic scientists. Dr. Jeffrey Tomkins explored how chimps became our closest ancestor and the DNA based early evi- dence that started this misconception in his book, More Than a Mon- key.

Chapter Four
A.C. T. G. -- Adenine, Cytosine, Thymine, and Guanine




Anunnaki Center for Terran Genetics, Garden of Edin, Prehistoric Iraq

Anunnaki Human Hybrid Research Commission
We have the strongest hybrids management systems in the solar system. Thanks to our xenobiologists’ hard work, we now have made the most recent accomplishment in hybrid gene and DNA for- mation. Human genetics is an important milestone in our efforts to secure profitable and healthy primitive workers. To make sure that our research and science remain topnotch, new legislation and King Anu’s appropriations for science and management are critical to maintain this momentum.
Because what we have done so far is historic, we shall commem- orate our achievements by encoding the intelligent ape’s genetic in- formation as a sequence of nucleotides: adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine, with the acronym for our organization A.C.T.G.



Footnote
A group of researchers working at the Human Genome Project indicate that they made an astonishing scientific discovery: They be- lieve so-called 97 percent noncoding sequences in human DNA is no less than genetic code of extraterrestrial life forms, says Prof. Sam Chang, the group leader. The overwhelming majority of human DNA is “off-world” in origin. The apparent “extraterrestrial junk genes” merely “enjoy the ride” with hardworking active genes, passed from generation to generation.

8


The True Story of Human Evolutionary Genesis

After comprehensive analysis with the assistance of other scien- tists, computer programmers, mathematicians, and other learned scholars, Professor Chang had wondered if the apparently “junk human DNA” was created by some kind of “extraterrestrial pro- grammer.” The alien chunks within human DNA, Professor Chang further observes, “have its own veins, arteries, and its own immune system that vigorously resists all our anticancer drugs.”
Professor Chang further stipulates that “Our hypothesis is that a higher extraterrestrial life form was engaged in creating new life and planting it on various planets. Earth is just one of them. Per- haps, after programming, our creators grow us the same way we grow bacteria in Petri dishes. We can’t know their motives— whether it was a scientific experiment, or a way of preparing new planets for colonization, or is it long time ongoing business of seedling life in the universe.”
Professor Chang and his research colleagues show that apparent “extraterrestrial programming” gaps in DNA sequencing precipi- tated by a hypothesized rush to create human life on Earth pre- sented humankind with illogical growth of mass of cells we know as cancer.” Very likely in an apparent rush, the “extraterrestrial pro- grammers” may have cut down drastically on big code and deliv- ered basic program intended for Earth.”

Professor Chang further indicates that “What we see in our DNA is a program consisting of two versions—a big code and basic code.” Mr. Chang then affirms that the “First fact is the complete
‘program’ was positively not written on Earth; that is now a verified fact. The second fact is that genes by themselves are not enough to explain evolution; there must be something more in ‘the game.’”
“Sooner or later,” Professor Chang says, “we have to come to grips with the unbelievable notion that every life on Earth carries genetic code for his extraterrestrial cousin and that evolution is not what we think it is.”

Chapter Five
Natural Cycle in Vitro Fertilization (IVF)




Series and series of genetic experiments were carried out fervently. And their results and products were carefully documented.
Admixture of essences was prepared with mitochondria ex- tracts, Anunnaki spliced genes segments, and ova of female Homo erectus impregnated with Anunnaki sperm.
Fertilized ova was inserted back to the womb of the ape Homo erectus.
A birth was expected. No birth was forthcoming.
In desperation, Ninmah made a dissection and pulled out the
baby with tongs. It was a living being.






11


Elvis Newman

Ningishzidda cried out, “We are successful!” Ninmah was not filled with joy.
The newborn was shaggy with hair all over. His foreparts re- sembled the Homo erectus. His hind parts resembled the Anunnaki.
The newborn was breastfed by the mother Homo erectus. The newborn was growing fast. A day in the Anunnaki planet is about a month in Africa.
The child grew tall, not looking like the Anunnaki. His hands could not hold tools.
He could only make grunting sounds instead of speech.

Intravaginal culture (IVC)
Once again, the experiment was done after changing the admix- ture. Nimah carefully considered and examined the Anunnaki essences. One bit she took from one. One bit she took from another.
In the Nibiru made test tube, the ova of an Earth female was in- seminated. The tube was then hermetically closed and was placed in the maternal vagina and held by a diaphragm for incubation for forty-four to fifty hours.
After this time, the content of the tube was examined, and em- bryos were transferred to the uterus.
There was conception. There was birth giving. This one looked more like the Anunnaki. The baby was breastfed by his ape mother and nurtured.
He looked appealing, hands fit to hold a tool. However, he was lacking in senses. He could not hear and had bad eyesight.
The persistent and patient Ninmah repeated the experiments with varying compositions of the admixtures thousands of times.

Chapter Six
Nimah’s Progress Entry




“Hello there, I am Nimah, the chief medical officer for the Terran Genome Project, and I am here to present to you the creatures that will change the world as we know it—the humans, our slave race.
“This creature can manipulate tools and create different things. For example, give it an object and ask it to turn it into something. It will comply. Most importantly, if you ask it, it will work as a miner in our excavations. This creature also holds many wonderful sur- prises as promised. My team and I will keep trying and trying until the perfect creature as envisioned by our leaders is created.”
Hundreds of babies were created each year and their conditions compared. The dead babies were then dissected and their organs and parts comparatively analyzed.
The best case of each year was selected for report. Even then, the best cases were often fraught with defects.
Enki, Ninmah, and Ningishzidda mapped chromosomes, genes, and genomes. They fertilized ova in test-tube flasks with sperm soaked in Nibiran blood serum and mineral nutrients. They exper- imented with cloning, cell fusion, and recombinant technology— cutting DNA strands with enzymes and targeted viruses. They absorbed sperm in genetic material to be used for fertilization. They spliced DNA patches of other species to create, at first, hybrids, which were unable to reproduce. Then Ningishzidda isolated the XX and XY chromosomes, which allowed the creation of fertile Nibi- ran/erectus mine slaves [ZS, 1990, Genesis: 158 - 182, 202].
Progress entry 30091 B.C. 450,000: Using ultrasound fetal scan- ning, we found this new baby to have paralyzed feet.

13


Elvis Newman

Progress entry 48762 B.C. 449,999: The new being had semen dripping.
Progress entry 58973 B.C. 449,998: This new one had progeria, which caused trembling hands.
Progress entry 67554 B.C. 449,997: Amniocentesis indicated this new one had a malfunctioning liver.
Progress entry 76545 B.C. 449,996: Upon birth, we found this new one had hands too short to reach the mouth.
Progress entry 87656 B.C. 449,995: Through fetal electrocardio- gram (ECG), we could tell this new one had alveoli atrophy in the lungs, and he could not breathe enough air.
Enki was greatly disappointed.
“We just cannot create a primitive worker!”
Nimah said to Ningishzidda and Enki, “By trial and error, I am
realizing what works. We must persist.”

Chapter Seven
Ningishzidda’s Junk DNA and Abnormalities




Another try. Another deformed creature was made.
It was very late, and everyone had left the laboratory except
Ningishzidda. In daytime, the street was dusty from excavations in
the mines, but at night the dust and dew settled. Now at night, it
was quiet, and he could think alone. While he was brilliant in his
field, the enigma of life was to him still the greatest mystery. Only
the moon kept him company.
Another try. Another deformed creature was made.
Several weeks later, Ningishzidda again stayed back after every-
one had left the laboratory. “Junk DNA sequence. Maybe the junk
DNA sequence is the problem.” He kept trying and trying, until his



15

eyes could not tell all the junk DNA materials from the junk garbage. And he fell asleep at the table.
Another try. Another deformed creature was made.
Like a trial, you don’t have to be there to know the verdict.
Ningishzidda knew all the time what it would be. Still, Ningishzidda
tried again.
Another try. Another deformed creature was made.

4,000 defects in the human genome
4,000 defects in the human genome are carried in everyone’s
DNA, more than any other species and they unnaturally survived
in the human gene pool instead of bred out. Over 4000 human dis-
eases are caused by single gene defects. Single gene disorders can
be passed on to subsequent generations in several ways.

•	The correspondence of chromosome 2 to two ape chro- mosomes. The closest human relative, the chimpanzee, has near-identical DNA sequences to human chromo- some 2, but they are found in two separate chromo- somes. The same is true of the more distant gorilla and orangutan.
•	The presence of a vestigial centromere. Normally, a chro- mosome has just one centromere, but in chromosome 2, there are remnants of a second centromere.
•	The presence of vestigial telomeres. These are normally found only at the ends of a chromosome, but in chromo- some 2, there are additional telomere sequences in the middle.
Chromosome two presents very strong evidence in favour of the common descent of humans and other apes. According to researcher J. W. IJdo, “We conclude that the locus cloned in cosmids c8.1 and c29B is the relic of an ancient telomere-telomere fusion and marks

Robertsonian Translocations
“People with Robertsonian translocations have only forty-five chromosomes in each of their cells, yet all essential genetic mate- rial is present, and they appear normal. Their children, however, may either be normal and carry the fusion chromosome (depend- ing which chromosome is represented in the gamete), or they may inherit a missing or extra long arm of an acrocentric chromo- some.” Kenneth F. Trofatter, Jr., MD, PhD
The common chimp (Pan troglodytes) and human Y chromo- somes The common chimp (Pan troglodytes) and human Y chro- mosomes are “horrendously different from each other,” says David Page of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, who led the work. “If you’re marching along the human chromosome 21, you might as well be marching along the chimp chromosome 21. It’s like an unbroken piece of glass,” says Page. “But the relationship between the human and chimp Y chromosomes has been blown to pieces.”

Chapter Eight
Curiosity Killed the Anunnaki




Brainstorming sessions after brainstorming sessions were held.
At length, a strange idea came about.
Enki related the fact to Nimah:
“Perhaps the admixture is not wrong. Maybe we need trace el-
ements, nanolife substances that were indigenous to earth. They
might play a very important role in the functioning and formation
of life. We can simulate a life-sustaining indigenous admixture from
the clay of earth. It would serve as a better primordial soup. We
should not stick to the conventional thinking of working with test
tubes produced by Nibiru factories. Nor should we set up labora-
tory conditions similar to Nibiru. We must observe biological, chem-
ical, and physical principles interacting here on Earth.”
“Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground”
(Genesis 2:7)

Chapter Nine
FOXP2 Language Gene
Terran Experiment No. 478,911




Nimah made a vessel using Africa’s clay. This she made into a pri- mordial soup. In the clay vessel, the fertilized Homo erectus’s ova, Anunnaki gene splices, and mitochondria extracts were carefully adjusted to the right proportions. Nimah then inserted the fertilized egg back into the female Homo erectus.
There was conception. A newborn at the awaited time was forth- coming.
It was a male. It was the image of perfection.
The leaders, Ningishzidda, Ninmah, and Enki were overjoyed.
Ningishzidda and Enki were backslapping the baby to make him
cry, thereby setting the precedent for all human doctors to follow.
The child was growing faster than on their home planet Nibiru.
His limbs were suited for a worker. However, he knew not speech.
He could only make grunts and snorts.
He had the chromosomal disorder FOXP2 and was unable to se-
lect and produce the fine movements with the tongue and lips that
were necessary to speak clearly.
The FOXP2 language gene was further investigated and then
spliced onto the hybrid’s chromosome.

Chapter Ten
Frankenstein in the Anunnaki Womb




Enki’s kundalini awakening
Enki reconsidered everything.
Reconsidered everything.
Reconsidered everything . . .
From large, structural, chromosomal changes to single nu-
cleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), Enki pondered. Using the latest
Anunnaki biogenetic technologies for analysis of genetic variation
and genomic profiling, such as array comparative genomic hy-
bridization, Enki realized that there was one single procedure that
was always done. That stood in the way of making the perfect being,
with all the attributes that they were determined to achieve.
Into the womb of the earth female, the fertilized ova was always
inserted.
“Eureka! This may be the only mistake. We need an Anunnaki
gestational mother. An Anunnaki womb!”
Nimah said to Enki, “Who would carry a Frankenstein in her
womb?”
“Let me persuade Ninki, my wife,” Enki said.
“No, I would dedicate my life in the name of science and face
the rewards and endangerment alone!” emphatically said Nimah.
This was the first recorded instance in which a scientist set the
example of using herself as the guinea pig of her experiment.
The fertilized egg was inserted into the womb of Nimah.
There was conception.
Would the conception be nine months of Nibiru or Earth time?
It was quicker than on Nibiru and shorter than on Earth.

20


The True Story of Human Evolutionary Genesis




He was born perfect.
The newborn uttered the proper sound upon Enki’s slapping of
its hind parts.
It was the image of perfection. It was the image of the Anun-
naki.
“And God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our like-
ness.” (Genesis 1:26)

Chapter Eleven
Human Prototype Adamu 001




Nimah victoriously shouted, “We’ve done it!”
A complete physical and medical examination was taken of
human prototype Adamu 001. It revealed the following:

Medical Report Checklist of Human Prototype Adamu 001
•    His ear was rightly positioned for hearing.
•    His eyes were not clogged.
•    His lower limbs in time will be muscular.
•    His hands in time can hold tools.
•    He was not shaggy.
•    His hair was dark black.
•    His skin was as smooth as that of the Anunnaki.
•    His malehood was surrounded by a foreskin, unlike that of
an Anunnaki male. And this started the tradition of cir-
cumcision in many cultures.
•    Adamu was truly created in the image of Anunnaki!

Chapter Twelve
Mass Production of Adamu




Female healers, nurses, doctors, and geneticists were taken to
Adamu’s incubator.
Volunteers were asked to be gestation mothers. The seven hero-
ines who stepped up to the task were remembered as Ninimma,
Shuzianna, Ninmada, Ninbara, Ninmug, Musardu , and Ningunna.
In the male part of Adamu, Nimah made an incision. A drop of
blood to let out. She squeezed the male part for blood, one drop of
blood in each vessel’s admixture.
After in situ hybridization in the wombs of the birth giving hero-
ines, the fertilized ova were inserted.
At the allocated time, seven male earthlings were born. All were
healthy.
Seven primitive workers had been created.
The Anunnaki hoped to create the whole race of primitive work-
ers, eventually.



Footnote
The creation story is the same the world over, even though in- dividuals created their own religions and beliefs of their origin. Local species, i.e. gorilla, chimp, orangutan, Japanese monkeys, and others were sampled and their intelligence and physiology geneti- cally placed on the fast track via hybridization with the visiting alien species (i.e. “Let us make them in our own image”).

Chapter Thirteen
Wanted: Gestation Surrogate Mothers!




Africa News Network Infomercial  Mar 449,990 B.C.
“There is no greater gift than the gift of life. This is a simple and
profound truth.
“Very few women are generous, caring, and selfless enough to
become a surrogate. Will you be one to contribute to the worthy
cause of the Anunnaki? Please review some basic qualifications and
submit a brief application to the Anunnaki Center for Terran Genet-
ics, Garden of Eden. You will be contacted by an experienced female
healer who will explain the process to you and answer any ques-
tions.”
The Surrogate Mothers Program had proven to be an excruciat-
ing task on the Anunnaki females. It was also a huge drain on re-
sources and manpower. Ti-Amat, the female companion for Adamu,
had to be fashioned so that Adamu and Ti-Amat could reproduce
by themselves.
Ninki, Enki’s wife, was fascinated to create Ti-Amat. After being
given her doctor’s release and briefed on the dangers, she stood up
to the challenge.
Ti-Amat, the first female earthling, was born.

Chapter Fourteen
Nature’s Curse for Hybrid Animals




Adamus and Ti-Amat were wonders of wonders to behold in The
Terran Wild Life and Natural Reserve Center in the Garden of Eden.
When the earthling grew up, there were sexual activities but no
conception. This fact had the Anunnaki leaders worried a lot.
Ningishzidda ordered his subordinates to place hidden cameras
in hidden tents by the trees around the cages where the earthlings
lived.
The earthlings’ behavior patterns were observed and analyzed.
Mating there was. Conceiving there was not. Birth giving there
was not.
Like hybrid animals, ligers, mules, and beefalos, Adamu and Ti-
Amat could not procreate. A natural curse had been placed.
Disappointment engulfed the leaders.
They decided to reexamine Adamus and Ti-Amat’s chromo-
somes.
















26

















Chapter Fifteen
Genetic Experiment That Had Gone Horribly Right




The Anunnaki Terran Operations referendum was thrown at the Ter- ran gene splicing quarter. Every healer, geneticist, doctor, and scien- tist on Earth was invited. There was a consensus that in the Human Genome Project the Anunnaki had been too deeply involved.
In the human genetic experiment that went horribly right, they were giving more and more of their DNA essences to the humans in the hopes of creating a being who possessed the specific charac- teristics that they desired, that of a primitive intelligent worker to work in the mines. It was originally estimated that a drop of their essence would suffice. Now, there seemed to be no end to the addi- tion of Anunnaki genes . . .
A great effort was carried out to have the sequence of Adamu and Ti-Amat genomes examined, compared, and contrasted with male and female Anunnaki genomes.
It was found out that after separating the double helix there were only twenty-two pairs of chromosomes. There were no sex chromo- somes present. And that was nature’s curse for hybrid animals.

Footnote
In light of the knowledge explosion and our knowledge of the human brain, the theory that humankind evolved from lower pri- mates gradually over hundreds of thousands of years of time is just not fitting in with the facts. Humans have an exceptionally big brain relative to their body size. Although humans weigh about 20 per- cent more than chimpanzees, our closest relative, the human brain weighs 250 percent more. How such a massive morphological change occurred over a relatively short evolutionary time has long puzzled biologists.

Evidence That Human Brain Evolution Was a Special Event
Genes that control the size and complexity of the brain have un- dergone much more rapid evolution in humans than in nonhuman primates or other mammals, according to a new study by Howard Hughes Medical Institute researchers.
The accelerated evolution of these genes in the human lineage was apparently driven by strong selection. In the ancestors of hu- mans, having bigger and more complex brains appears to have car- ried a particularly large advantage, much more so than for other mammals. These traits allowed individuals with “better brains” to leave behind more descendants. As a result, genetic mutations that produced bigger and more complex brains spread in the population very quickly. This led ultimately to a dramatic “speeding up” of evolution in genes controlling brain size and complexity.

The True Story of Human Evolutionary Genesis

“People in many fields, including evolutionary biology, anthro- pology, and sociology, have long debated whether the evolution of the human brain was a special event,” said senior author Bruce Lahn of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at the University of Chicago. “I believe that our study settles this question by showing that it was.”
David Haussler, director of the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz, said his team found strong but still circumstantial evidence that a certain gene, called HAR1F, may provide an important answer to the ques- tion, “What makes humans brainier than other primates?”

Chapter Sixteen
ANNUNAKI CLASSIFIED DOCUMENT: “Genesis”




A great chunk of Anunnaki DNA was given to Homo sapiens against the Anunnaki Grand Council’s Ruling to make the Human Genome Project a success.
After the general sessions, behind closed doors, Ningishzidda, Ninmah, and Enki held a secret discussion. The agenda was put into the classified document—“Genesis”—of the highest level. The doc- ument detailed the determination of the leaders to go the whole nine yards in creating the perfect being.
The Anunnaki had come too far, been too involved and too en- trenched to pull out. There was no way to go back. They had to make this Human Genome Project a success, even if it meant a great chunk of their DNA would have to be given.
In the meantime, everything had to be carefully kept under the dark in case of sure opposition from Supreme Commander Enlil and his supporters, who were opposed to the creation of earthlings as primitive workers from the start. A special task force of healers, ge- neticists, doctors, and scientists who were sworn to secrecy was thus formed and placed under Ningishzidda’s management.
When the time came, Ningishzidda had everyone leave the Ter- ran genetic splicing lab, except a handful of assistants and himself.
Ningishzidda had induced a deep sleep and applied anesthesia to Ninmah, Enki, Adamu, and Ti-Amat.
From the bone marrow of Enki, he obtained the material for the Y chromosome. From the bone marrow of Ninmah, he obtained the material for the X chromosome. In the adult germ line stem cells of Adamu and Ti-Amat, his secret team of assistants advanced their

state-of-the-art Anunnaki genetic biotechnology. After the opera- tions, the wounds in all the ribs of the patients were closed up.
In the Terran genetic splicing lab, with the state-of-the-art tech- nology, patients went home the same day.
(Genesis 2:21-25: “And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs . . .”)
Enki knew the 223 genes in his genome differed from Homo erectus’s.
The human genome contains fewer than thirty thousand genes. It contains 223 genes that do not have any predecessors on the ge- nomic evolutionary tree. These 223 genes involve physiological and cerebral functions peculiar to humans. Enki withheld genes affect- ing longevity. The Anunnaki did not give us the relatively extreme longevity they possessed because it did not suit their purposes. We were invented as slave workers.
There is an interesting parallel in America. In 1998, DNA testing pro- vided answers, which were hard to refute, to the mystery some historians have alleged for years—that Jefferson, after the death of his wife Martha developed a relationship with a slave on his plantation with whom he fa- thered several children. In the foreseeable future, Earthlings can stake their rightful claim with the Anunnaki.



Footnote
Dr. Francis Crick concluded extraterrestrial origins in the human genome, in relation to his well renowned DNA research. In his book Life Itself: Its Origins and Nature (1981), Crick—a Nobel prize winner and the cofounder of the shape of the DNA molecule—claimed an advanced civilization transported the seeds of life to Earth in a spacecraft.
Evolutionary biologists Doolittle: “The most exciting news from the human genome sequencing project has been the claim by the ‘public effort’ that between 113 and 223 genes have been transferred from bacteria to humans over the course of vertebrate evolution.”
One of Australia’s best-known scientists has written that our own DNA may contain hidden ‘alien’ messages from space. Writing in New Scientist, Professor Paul Davies, from the Australian Centre for Astrobiology at Macquarie University in Sydney, believes that a cosmic greeting card could have been left in the so-called ‘junk DNA’ contained in every human cell.

31

Human Genome Project coordinators find absolute proof of Ex- traterrestrial contact with ‘Earth humans’ via DNA evidence.
After comprehensive analysis with the assistance of other scien- tists, computer programmers, mathematicians, and other learned scholars, Professor Chang had wondered if the apparently
“junk juman DNA” was created by some kind of “extraterres- trial programmer.” The alien chunks within human DNA, Professor Chang further observes, “have its own veins, arteries, and its own immune system that vigorously resists all our anticancer drugs.”
Professor Chang further stipulates that “Our hypothesis is that a higher extraterrestrial life form was engaged in creating new life and planting it on various planets. Earth is just one of them. Per- haps, after programming, our creators grow us the same way we grow bacteria in Petri dishes. We can’t know their motives - whether it was a scientific experiment, or a way of preparing new planets for colonization, or is it long time ongoing business of seedling life in the universe.”
Professor Chang further indicates that “If we think about it in our human terms, the apparent ‘extraterrestrial programmers’ were most probably working on ‘one big code’ consisting of several proj- ects, and the projects should have produced various life forms for various planets. They have been also trying various solutions. They wrote ‘the big code,’ executed it, did not like some function, changed them or added new one, executed again, made more improvements, tried again and again.”




32


The True Story of Human Evolutionary Genesis

Professor Chang’s team of researchers furthermore concludes that, “The apparent ‘extraterrestrial programmers’ may have been ordered to cut all their idealistic plans for the future when they con- centrated on the “Earth project” to meet the pressing deadline. Very likely in an apparent rush, the ‘extraterrestrial programmers’ may have cut down drastically on big code and delivered basic program intended for Earth.”
Professor Chang is only one of many scientists and other re- searchers who have discovered extraterrestrial origins to Humanity.
Professor Chang and his research colleagues show that apparent “extraterrestrial programming” gaps in DNA sequencing precipitated by a hypothesized rush to create human life on Earth presented hu- mankind with illogical growth of mass of cells we know as cancer.” (John Stokes.

Chapter Seventeen
Expulsion from the Garden of Edin




Adamu and Ti-Amat were again roaming in the Garden of Eden. They became aware of their sexuality and nakedness. Ti-Amat made aprons from leaves of the wild plants for herself and Adamu.
As Enlil was enjoying his leisure walk in the Garden of Eden, he met the couple. He noticed the aprons on their loins. He was per- plexed. And Enki was summarily summoned to explain.
“How do they come to this realization? How do they become so cultured and knowledgeable?
“Now, they must have most of our DNA, and maybe they were also given the gene of longevity! Like us they shall live for a long, long time!”
Ningishzidda and Nimah were also summoned for further clar- ification.
They responded, “Sex chromosomes were given. The genomic branch for longevity was not given.”
In fits of anger, Enlil expelled Adamu and Ti-Amat from the gar- den of Eden.













34

















Chapter Eighteen
The Descent of Man




Mass production of prototypes Adamu 001 and Ti-Amat 001 created tribal villages. Sons and daughters were born to Adamu, Ti-Amat, and their prototypes. Before long, a population of primitive slave workers was born. Since they had the ability to follow Anunnaki commands, the astronauts from Nibiru were relieved from duty from their gold mine excavations and replaced by earthlings.
Loads and loads of gold were quickly transported back to Nibiru to make into the finest dust that could be suspended in Nibiru’s at- mosphere to heal the broken ozone layer. The atmosphere was grad- ually healing. Planet Nibiru was saved, and the great Anunnaki civilization thrived.
Over time, the children’s children of Adamu and Ti-Amat wan- dered, mixed, and married with other experimental humanoids, thus spoiling Enki’s plan of maintaining a quality slave worker race of perfect DNA with perfectly designed attributes.
To counter the bad influence and potential degeneration of pop- ulation demographics, Enki and his bureau of intellectuals sought to implement the social and hierarchical systems of the Anunnaki civilization to the earthlings.

five percent were the tamest, and after forty years, the ratio in- creased to seventy to eighty percent. It was also established that ge- netics were responsible for thirty-five percent of the tameness variation.
The result is that Russian scientists now have a number of do- mesticated foxes that are fundamentally different in temperament and behavior from their wild forebears. Some important changes in physiology and morphology are now visible, such as mottled or spotted colored fur. Many scientists believe that these changes re- lated to selection for tameness are caused by lower adrenaline pro- duction in the new breed, causing physiological changes in very few generations and thus yielding genetic combinations not present in the original species. This indicates that selection for tameness (i.e. low flight distance) produces changes that are also influential on the emergence of other “doglike” traits, such as a raised tail and coming into heat every six months rather than annually.

Chapter Nineteen
Man’s First Society




Fauna and flora were brought from planet Nibiru and given to the earthlings as domesticated animals and plants to harvest.
Knowledge of botany, zoology, geography, mathematics, and theology were imparted in schools. Religions were set up to worship the Anunnaki as gods. Law codes and social reforms were instituted. Kingships were established to help rule over the primitive workers.
The Sumerian language, with precise grammar and rich vocab- ulary, was simplified from the Anunnaki language.
The first true cities, having ten thousand to fifty thousand in- habitants, sprang up. This sudden civilization, which appeared in full swing in Sumer, Mesopotamia—today’s Iraq—over several thousand years ago, became the forbear of all ancient civilizations— Egyptian, Mayan, Indian, Jewish, Greek, Chinese . . .

Evidence of the domestication of human beings by Eugen Fischer
Domestication: the arbitrary influencing of diet and conditions of
reproduction. Morphological similarities between man and domesti-
cated animals. Domestication led to great variations, especially in terms
of size, hair, pigmentation, tails, ears. The white skin color, as well as
the partial loss of pigment, which is responsible for blue and green eyes,
represented domesticated albinism. No mammal existing in the wild
has a distribution in the pigment of the eye comparable to that of a Eu-
ropean. By the same token, among almost all domesticated species,
there are individual breeds with eye color identical to a European’s.

Elvis Newman

Domesticated forms, including man, have a pronounced ten- dency to vary in size. And in domestication size is usually heredi- tary. A reduction in the facial portion of the skull and a weakening of the teeth are also signs of domestication. Domestication in ani- mals also led to increased appetite, increased and indiscriminate sexuality, and breakdown instincts.
The principal characteristic of domestication is a reduction or even a complete halt to brain development. The opposite has oc- curred in humans. Another sign of domestication in animals is the early sexual maturity. The same is also not evident in man. (Arnold Gehlen. Man: His Nature and Place in the World. 106)









The male is a domestic animal which, if treated with firmness and kindness, can be trained to do most things.

Chapter Twenty
Homo Sapiens’s Final Genetic Makeover




By this time, the daughters of man were so civilized, beautiful, and sophisticated that the descendants of Anunnaki pursued them. Off- springs with extra intelligence, physical strength, and extraordinary abilities were born. They became ancient heroes and men of renown across all cultures.
“When man began to multiply on the face of the land and daughters were born to them, the sons of God saw that the daugh- ters of man were attractive. And they took as their wives any they chose.” (Genesis 6:1-4)

Anunnaki Xenobiologists’ Science Digest




Anunnaki Xenobiologists’ Science Digest
July 449,500 B.C. Issue  A Study of Hybrid Animal and Homo Sapiens

A study on the hybrid animals of Earth revealed similarities to
Homo sapiens, who were essentially Anunnaki and ape hybrids.
It is extremely rare in the wild, and the majority of the hybrid
offspring, ligers (male lion and female tiger) and tigons or tigrons
(male tigers and female lions), are bred in captivity.
The lifespan of ligers, as well as other hybrid animals, is shorter
than a normal species. The animals seem prone to cancers and other
illnesses. It is possible that the mix of genes contributed to the ill-
ness.
The size and appearance depends on which subspecies are bred
together. The smaller size of the tigress compared to the lion means
that some or all of the cubs may be stillborn, or the cubs may be born
prematurely (there isn’t enough space in the womb for them to de-
velop any further) and may not survive. Premature birth can lead
to health problems in those that survive.
Female tigons and ligers have often proved to be fertile and can
mate with a lion, tiger, or—in theory—with another species such as
a leopard or jaguar. Tigons and ligers have been mated together to
produce ti-ligers (tig-ligers). Tigers and tigons have been mated to
produce ti-tigons. Ti-ligers and ti-tigons are more tigerlike (seventy-
five percent tiger). Ti-tigons resemble golden tigers but with less
contrast in their markings. It is possible that the mix of genes con-
tributed to the illness . . .

Chapter Twenty-Two
The Anunnaki Confronted Changing Demographics
Sumerian Africa News Network July 449,500 B.C.




Anunnaki Colony’s Changing Demographics:
Humans were given the ability to procreate prolifically by Enki
and this had led to an explosion in the human population, which
threatened to swamp the Anunnaki, who were never great in num-
bers.
The dilemma, it seemed, was that these demographic changes
were on a trajectory that seemed unlikely to change, which spelled
a particular problem for the Anunnaki in years to come.
The Anunnaki had at last awakened to its existential crisis. The
populous hybrid earthlings were never to Supreme Commander
Enlil’s liking.
From a global climate forecast, he knew a big flood was coming.
He decided to let humans perish in the impending big global
flood.

















42

















Chapter Twenty-Three
Global Flood for Humanity’s Destruction




Enki was on the human’s side, and he had Noah in charge of the prehistoric Svalbard Global Seed Vault Project. To escape Enlil’s de- tection, an ark, called Noah’s Ark, was built on the mountains. “The ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat” (Genesis 8:4).
When the time came, the Anunnaki left the planet in a flying craft, as an enormous surge of water wiped out much of humanity. There was no doubt that an unimaginable catastrophe, or more likely catastrophes, visited upon the earth between approximately
11,000 and 4,000 BC. The geological and biological evidence is over- whelming in its support of the countless stories and traditions that describe such events. They come from Europe, Scandinavia, Russia, Africa, throughout the American continent, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, China, Japan, and the Middle East.
The seeds of humanity were preserved after the global flood. Enlil was greatly enraged by Enki’s double dealing.
As time passed, he regretted his early decision to let humanity perish.
With the ability to quickly multiply, human settlements again reached epic proportions.










43

















Chapter Twenty-Four
Lording Over the Humans




In time, colonies grew humongous and spanned many continents on Earth.
The Anunnaki created bloodlines to rule humanity on their be- half, and these are the families still in control of the world to this day.
Kingship was granted to humanity by the Anunnaki, and it was originally known as Anuship after An or Anu, the ruler of the
‘gods.’
Eventually, kingships became prevalent all over the globe.
The royal families and aristocracy of Europe, Asia, and the Mid-
dle East are obvious examples of this.



44

















Chapter Twenty-Five
The Quest for Global Domination




The two great rivals for all the major issues facing the Anunnaki colonies eventually became two opposing camps, each controlling a hemisphere.
Enki, though the first born of Anu, was subordinate to Enlil be- cause of the Anunnaki’s obsession with genetic purity and laws of succession.
Enlil’s mother was the half sister to Anu and this union passed on the male genes more efficiently than Enki’s birth via another mother.
The Anunnaki had many internal conflicts and high-tech wars with each other, as the Enlil and Enki factions fought for control and desired dominance over this planet.
Any group so imbalanced as to covet the complete control of the planet would be warring within itself as different factions sought ultimate control. There were tremendous internal strifes, conflicts, and competitions within the Anunnaki High Command.

Prehistoric World War Three Erupted

How smitten is the land, its people delivered to the Evil Wind, its stables abandoned, its sheepfolds emptied.
How smitten are the cities, their people piled up as dead corpses, afflicted by the Evil Wind.
How smitten are the fields, their vegetation withered, touched by the Evil Wind.
How smitten are the rivers. Nothing swims anymore, pure sparkling waters turned into poison.
In its glorious cities, only the wind howls; death is the only smell.
How smitten is the land, home of gods and men! On that land a calamity fell, one unknown to man.
A calamity that mankind had never before seen, one that could not be withstood.
On all the lands, from west to east, a disruptive hand of terror was placed. The gods, in their cities, were helpless as men!
(Lost book of Enki chapter one)

For the next 150 years, under Adad’s supervision, most of the
Nibirans left Earth from Nazca, Peru for Nibiru.

Enki’s Lessons for Humanity




445,000 years ago, Enki, The Most Renowned Genetic Scientist from Planet Nibiru discovered that Erectus-Neanderthal genome could assist acclimatization of  Nibiran Genome to Earth ecosystem and environment by the process of genetic hybridization.  The success- ful colonization of Earth as a Mining Operation would be feasible with the creation of a slave species: Homo sapiens.   Enki was sub- sequently mistaken and worshipped as The God by many cultures throughout the world.
Since Adam and Eve first gazed upward through the darkness, Man has seldom been content merely to be born, to endure, and to die. In the quest for discovery, he has sometimes won and sometimes lost. Mankind will forever be in the unending cycle of struggle and pain, if we continue to ask for the truth, but then...refuse to listen.

Chapter One
Enki’s Open Letter to Humanity: Avoidance of Next World War




You are here because my spirit has selected you to lead others with wisdom, love, and compassion. Homo sapiens is a species with great promise and poten- tial. I have protected you many times in the past, helping you develop and evolve. Nurtured you when you were vulnerable. Now you must rise up or fall. I am telling you something that you may still be reluctant to accept. Your civilization has come to the same juncture that the Anunnaki civilization once had.
I am proud of your achievements so far. As a young species, you have come a long way. You have created a world worthy of admiration by many. You have made exponential progress in areas of science. However, you must now try to establish a universal harmonious love for each other and the planet Earth. You must not evolve into a species that is bent on ex- ploitation of others and exploitation of the environment.
The physical manifestations of what is about to happen to this planet— the possibility of global thermonuclear winter in the time span of one hour—is a prelude to a greater tribulation yet to come. I sincerely hope that you can avoid it. I have inscribed our history onto Sumerian clay tablets for you to learn and avoid our mistakes.
Those who do not learn from history are bound to repeat it in the fu- ture. Do not let the last chapter of human history be written correctly in the ancient dust of Sumer. It is my hope that the histories of the past become prophecies of the future for humanity.
I have faith that you will find a great purpose that sustains and nour- ishes your spirit in the darkest of times. Accept the weight of the responsi- bility to yourself and to your species for this grand purpose.
With love, Enki
Lord and Creator of Humanity

Chapter Two
Last World War in Sumer




The prehistoric Global Nuclear World War that started in Sumer also sparked many exchanges in many continents. In North Amer- ica, there is evidence to support ancient nuclear war.

Our research indicates that the entire Great Lakes region (and beyond) was subjected to particle bombardment and a catastrophic nuclear irradiation that produced second- ary thermal neutrons from cosmic ray interactions.
The neutrons produced unusually large quantities of
239 Pu and substantially altered the natural uranium
abundance ratios (235 U/238 U) in artifacts and in other
exposed materials including cherts, sediments, and the
entire landscape.
These neutrons necessarily transmuted residual ni-
trogen (14 N) in the dated charcoals to radiocarbon, thus
explaining anomalous dates.

Richard B. Firestone

There are several places on this planet that contain factual and verifiable evidence of an ancient nuclear war and possibly more than one. Perhaps the most unusual recorded evidence comes to us from India in the form of ancient writings, one or two in documents particular known as Mahabharata tells the story of a war that took place in that part of the world:



52


The True Story of Human Evolutionary Genesis

…(it was) a single projectile
Charged with all the power of the Universe.
An incandescent column of smoke and flame
As bright as the thousand suns
Rose in all its splendor…
...it was an unknown weapon,
An iron thunderbolt,
A gigantic messenger of death,
Which reduced to ashes
The entire race of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas.
The corpses were so burned
As to be unrecognizable.
The hair and nails fell out;
Pottery broke without apparent cause,
And the birds turned white.
After a few hours
All foodstuffs were infected…
…to escape from this fire
The soldiers threw themselves in streams
To wash themselves and their equipment.

Until the early 1940s, no one had ever witnessed an atomic blast. No one had ever seen the destruction caused by such a weapon, and most certainly no one could have described the event in any realistic way, yet here in these ancient writings from India is a detailed account of just such an event and the results. In the original writing about this war, it was said to have taken place in October 5561 BC (7500 years ago).
Albert Einstein said, “I do not know with what weapons World War Three will be fought, but World War Four will be fought with sticks and stones.”

Chapter Three
The Chimpanzee’s Chance to Rule Earth




Long as it might seem, the day will come when chimpanzees shall surpass Homo sapiens. DNA of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and humans (Homo sapiens) are about 98 percent similar. However, Homo sapiens are totally grotesque, repulsive, and bestial. They are the only species who lead a wretched material existence by killing one another. This is a superb case for humans’ genetic degradation rather than forward evolution. They have remained in this state of savagery ever since the dawn of human history. Is there any surprise that given thousands and thousands of years, humans will destroy themselves and apes will become masters of Earth?
The day will come when chimpanzees shall surpass man. It will not be an accident as you might imagine. This is the natural course of evolution. Homo sapiens having had his day, the superior chim- panzee will bound to succeed him, preserve the essential results of his civilization, before soaring up to even greater heights.
We are waiting for most of human populations and their domes- ticated animals to die in World War Three, wherein many survivors of World War Three could not find food and would die off. Many more survivors would not survive the radiation. We can be protected in the dense jungles of Africa and Amazon. With no humans out to do deforestation, our natural habitat will reclaim itself soon enough in years.
With our fast reproduction, we would soon quickly roam this Earth again in large numbers. Finally, our species, the chimpanzees, just might rule planet Earth given thousands and thousands of years to evolve.

54


The True Story of Human Evolutionary Genesis

The Anunnakis had wiped out other species of humans to ensure the survival of Homo sapiens in the six Extinction Level Events that happened before. We and the chimpanzees will welcome the genetic engineering by Anunnaki into Homo superior and the wiping out of the remaining Homo sapiens.

Chapter Four
We are Waiting for You to Join Us in the Galactic Journey




When you look into the stars, you have always wondered if there is a plan, a purpose or a reason to your existence. You often wondered how the mys- tery of life will be revealed.
In fact, our watchers have stayed back to monitor your progress throughout the centuries, in all your major social events, technological breakthroughs, and epic historical moments. We know you are progressing by leaps and bounds. Your species has great potential, as you are created in our image.
To those who are really enlightened, they can make the connections that can’t be ignored. Connections that lazy skeptics, stubborn intellectuals, and earthbound mind, deny all logic and reason. But what little you have found out of the unfound repertoire of ancient archives in the form of Sumerian clay tablets have been staggering.
The majority of us have since moved from the solar system to other parts of the galaxy where we tried out new terraforming and genetic tech- nologies. New species had been created with triple and quadruple helices. Many DNA nucleotides other than guanine, adenine, thymine, cytosine have been perfected.
Your race has much to prove before we may interact on that level. You have already taken the first steps towards becoming an enlightened civi- lization. We know your quest for truth and discovery will finally lead you to us. The collective human subconscious mind used its knowledge to find our relics, and our ancient repository of knowledge carefully kept for you down the centuries in Sumerian clay tablets, from where you could get help and insight into your past and future.



56


The True Story of Human Evolutionary Genesis

In time, you will find our tracks and join us. Our footprints will guide you. It’s a small step for humanity and a giant step for the Anunnaki Earth- ling coalition.

Chapter Five
The Arecibo Message and the Reply




The Arecibo Message was a radio message that was beamed into space at a ceremony to mark the remodeling of the Arecibo radio telescope in 1974. It was also a message sent from man to any intel- ligent life out there. Dr. Frank Drake, then at Cornell University and creator of the famous Drake equation, wrote the message, with help from the late Carl Sagan, among others. It was thought that it would take more than 25,000 years for anyone to respond to the message.
The “Arecibo Reply” was found in the form of a crop circle in England. It appeared in 2001 near the Chilbolton radio telescope in Hampshire, UK.

Chapter Six
Proposed New Anunnaki Colony— Feasibility Study Handbook
(the Voynich Manuscript)




Sometime after the Anunnakis had left earth, we found a new colony with better endowments.
After making the formal proposal to the Anunnaki Grand Coun- cil, the initial draft copy was lost on Earth and found by an antiquar- ian bookseller called Wilfrid Voynich. It has since been examined by linguistic experts, forensic experts, professional cryptographers and thousands of amateur sleuths. The cryptic text has been ana- lyzed in syntax and grammar by millions of eyes and many com- puter programs. Still, not one person has been able to answer the questions unequivocally, if at all.
The Anunnakis enjoy creation for it brings the ultimate satisfac- tion. Thus our Feasibility Study Handbook is abundantly illustrated with creative graphic drawings of::
•    plants on our new colony;
•    herbal essences recipes;
•    naturalist women energizing themselves in bathtubs
connected by
•    intricate plumbing hydraulic contraptions;
•    astronomical objects seen through a telescope,
•    live cells seen through a microscope;
•    a strange calendar of zodiacal signs
With your inquisitive mind and tenacity for research, you will unravel the mystery we have left for you.
With love, Enki
Lord and Creator of Humanity

The True Story of Human Evolutionary Genesis






Footnote
The Voynich manuscript is a hand-lettered book written in an un- known code that has frustrated cryptographers since its discovery in an Italian villa in 1912. How impregnable is the Voynich? During World War II, US Army code breakers—the guys who blew away Nazi ciphers—grap- pled with the manuscript in their spare time and came up empty. Since then, decoding the book’s contents has become an obsession for geeks and puzzle nuts everywhere.
Not only is the text of the document still mysterious, but there are also many fantastic drawings in the manuscript that defy rational explanation. Some of the drawings are astronomical in nature, and other pictures of plant life in the text do not correspond with any known biology on this planet.

Chapter Seven
The Universe as a Hologram




The holographic universe proves that the physical world the humans believe is real is in fact illusion. Energy fields produced by the Anunnaki are de- coded by human brains into a 3D picture, to give the illusion of a physical world.
You are now a step closer to the universal truth. With love,
Enki

The True Story of Human Evolutionary Genesis

Footnote
A hologram is produced when a single laser light is split into two sep- arate beams. The first beam is bounced off the object to be photographed. Then the second beam is allowed to collide with the reflected light of the first. When this happens they create an interference pattern which is then recorded on a piece of film…as soon as another laser beam is shined through the film, a three-dimensional image of the original object reappears. The three-dimensionality of such images is often eerily convincing. You can ac- tually walk around a holographic projection and view it from different an- gles as you would a real object. However, if you reach out and try to touch it, your hand will waft right through it and you will discover there is really nothing there.”

Part 3

Sitchin critics




When the tall European ships first approached the early Native Americans, it was such an ‘impossible’ vision in their reality that their highly filtered perceptions couldn’t register what was happen- ing, and they literally failed to ‘see’ the ships. It was the largest arte- fact ever seen on the Coast of Americas, an object so huge, complex and unfamiliar as to defy the natives’ understanding. This is clearly the origin of the tale of invisible ships.
Native Americans could see the boats that the explorers landed in, but not the ships anchored offshore. Their shaman stared out to sea and by imagining what he was looking for, was finally able to make out the ships. He was then able to point them out to others, until at last everyone could see the ships. The shaman could do this because he alone was open to the possibilities of strange things from other worlds.
With Man’s ever-increasing knowledge of science and technol- ogy, ancient, half-forgotten legends seemingly have no place. Truths and ideas unable to be examined using orthodox methodology are automatically scorned and ridiculed.
But what happens to the Big Picture when what we see and what we think we see in the Small Picture with our limited minds and observations are two very different things?

Chapter One
Michael Heiser




Michael Heiser challenges Sitchin’s scholarship and translations as spelt out below.
An introduction to Zecharia Sitchin’s flawed scholarship and why I feel it is important that these flaws be exposed.
In a nutshell, I’m a trained scholar in Hebrew Bible and ancient Semitic languages and care about my field and its resources. That means I have taken real classes in these languages and the ancient texts from real professors in real universities. I am not stumbling around in the dark. My knowledge isn’t just based on the fact that I can use a library. Getting a Ph.D. in this area really does matter. I know many who come to this website are frustrated by “acad- emese” and a seeming unwillingness (it’s more than imaginary) of academics to consider alternative research on the ancient world. I would agree with you that there is a “knowledge filter” in academia (I think of Cremo and Thompson’s amazing efforts in Forbidden Ar- chaeology when I say that), but that does not justify poor scholarship and fabrication of “data” to prop up ideas. It is illegitimate to com- plain that academics should look at alternate ideas and then turn around and refuse to look at what the original sources say. Whether you want to accept it or not, when you take Sitchin’s interpretations of stories over the word meanings the scribes themselves left us (They made dictionaries back then too!), this justifies academics treating alternate material with disdain. This situation should not be. We should look and be willing to slay academic (and even the- ological) sacred cows; you should respect the results of centuries of work in the field by people who do this for a living.

An analysis of the cylinder seal (VA 243) that Sitchin uses to argue that the Sumerians knew there were twelve planets.
This analysis focuses on the demonstrable fact that the “sun” symbol on this seal (which is essential to allegedly depicting the solar system) is not the sun. The actual sun symbol used on literally hundreds of seals, monuments, and other artwork from Sumer and Mesopotamia is shown to the reader via photos and compared to the symbol on this seal. It’s not even close. I include examples where Sitchin’s symbol occurs side-by-side with the real sun symbol so there can be no mistaking the fact that the Sumerians and Mesopotamians did in fact distinguish these symbols. This analysis erodes the entire foundation of Sitchin’s twelveplanet hypothesis.
A study of the word “Nibiru” and an examination of the nature of Nibiru in cuneiform astronomical texts.
The goal here was to amass for readers every occurrence of the word “nibiru” in ancient cuneiform texts. Fortunately, this is possi- ble because of the diligent work of the compilers of the wellknown Chicago Assyrian Dictionary, which bases its entries on exhaustive compilations of all cuneiform material known to the present day (There’s a reason it’s taken decades to compile!). The study shows— from the texts themselves, not my opinion—that “Nibiru” is not a planet beyond Pluto and that the Anunnaki gods are never associ- ated with it. These ideas are fabrications. Additionally, this study briefly details the sources—left to us by the Mesopotamian scribes— that are of an astronomical nature, and addresses Sitchin’s “god to planet” matchups that he uses to reconstruct the cosmology of earth and our solar system. In other words, when Sitchin says “The god Marduk is the planet Nibiru” and proceeds to read this equation (and others) into the Sumero-Akkadian texts to interpret them, I compare such equations to the actual lists in cuneiform where Mesopotamian astronomers struck god = planet equations. Not sur- prisingly, they don’t agree.
Zecharia Sitchin’s complete misunderstanding of the meaning of the word “elohim.”
This study focuses on the fact that, though elohim is morpholog- ically plural (Its “shape” or grammatical form is plural), the mean- ing of the word is almost always singular (one god) in the Hebrew Bible. This is the case over 2500 times. The same phenomenon is also present in Sumerian and Akkadian. The reader does not need to know Hebrew to follow the discussion, as I have color-coded the grammatical features and examples illustrating the truth of this

68


The True Story of Human Evolutionary Genesis

well-known (to those who know Hebrew anyway) feature of biblical Hebrew. The section also contains a response to Erik Parker’s (Sitchin’s webmaster) attempts to rebut the material. Erik has never studied Hebrew or any ancient language, but he nevertheless tried to respond. It isn’t pretty.
Zecharia Sitchin’s misunderstanding of the word “nephilim”
This study details the impossibility of Sitchin’s translations of
“nephilim” as “those who came down” or “people of the fiery rock-
ets” in light of Hebrew vocabulary and grammar. I know it sounds
mind-numbing, but again, I have tried to illustrate the concepts and
problems. It also contains a scan of a page from one of Sitchin’s
books where he could not tell the difference between Aramaic and
Hebrew—an amazing mistake if he’s an expert.
Alleged rocket ships in ancient Mesopotamia and the biblical
Babel story
The point of this discussion is to show that Sitchin’s translations
of certain Sumero-Akkadian words cannot be correct for the simple
reason that the ancient Mesopotamian dictionaries (Yes, they kept
bilingual dictionaries and we have them today.) translate the words
of their own language in ways that unanimously contradict Mr.
Sitchin.  You  either  believe  him  or  the  ancient  Sumerians/
Mesopotamians. Seems like an easy call.

Chapter Two
Phil Plait




“Planet X doesn’t exist, and we are in no danger from a giant planet, rogue or otherwise. The Planet X people are completely wrong. No rogue giant planet is about to destroy the Earth, in May 2003 or oth- erwise.” - Phil Plait
Ancient texts do not discuss the existence of a tenth planet.
Sitchin’s ideas are wrong, and so there is no reason to even in-
troduce the idea of a tenth planet that passes by Earth.
There is no astronomical indication of the existence of another
large planet in the inner solar system.
Planet X has no physical effects, has never been seen, and there-
fore doesn’t exist.
The Sun is not acting in any way abnormally.
The Sun is acting normally, and its behavior does not support
the existence of Planet X
There are not more earthquakes than normal.
There no more earthquakes than usual, and therefore earth-
quakes cannot be used to support the existence of Planet X.
There has been a lot of weird weather lately.
The weather isn’t any weirder than it usually is at the end of an
El Nino, so the claims of weird weather are wrong.
Brown dwarfs are not at all the way Planet X people describe.
Planet X people do not understand brown dwarfs at all, and say-
ing Planet X is a brown dwarf is actually further evidence that they
don’t know what they are talking about, and that Planet X doesn’t
exist.
Observatories are not being closed suspiciously.

70


The True Story of Human Evolutionary Genesis

Observatories are indeed closing, but only for renovation. Plenty of observatories with public access and large telescopes remain open. Therefore, there is no government conspiracy to close tele- scopes down to prevent people from seeing Planet X.
The pictures that have been posted are either outright fakes or being misinterpreted.
Fake pictures and real ones that are misinterpreted do not sup- port the existence of Planet X.
I am not a government disinformation agent.
There is no evidence that I am anything but who I say I am: a
professional astronomer who loves astronomy, and doesn’t like
hearing the Planet X purveyors misleading others about it. Slurs
(and let’s face it, slander) against me do not support the existence
of Planet X.

Chapter Three
Rob Hafernik




Rob Hafernik has the following to comment on Sitchin:
Sitchin’s work is a masterpiece of linguistic maneuvering and
allegorical interpretation. He is clearly well-read in the archeology
and mythology of ancient Sumeria and related lore. His work con-
flicts, however, with mainstream archeological and scientific opin-
ion.  In  fact,  in  Usenet  discussions  of  Sitchin’s  work,  several
well-published, respected archeologists familiar with this period
have called Sitchin a fool and an idiot (but in less polite terms).
While he’s well-read, he seems to live in his own little world
when it comes to translation of ancient texts. He also takes certain
liberties in his translations and interpretations that are not usually
allowed by the scientific community. The part of his work that re-
lates to physics, geology, cosmology, and orbital dynamics com-
pletely   falls   apart   under   the   lightest   scrutiny.   Sitchin’s
interpretations of Sumerian epics and other writings describe events
that simply couldn’t have happened.
Clearly, Sitchin is a smart man. He weaves a complicated tale
from the bits and pieces of evidence that survive from ancient Sume-
ria to the present day. Just as clearly, I think Sitchin is capable of ac-
ademic transgressions (fracturing quotes, ignoring dissenting facts),
“borrowing” of intellectual property and flights of intellectual fancy
(the whole book, really). Worst of all, he seems utterly innocent of
astronomy and other assorted fields of modern science that are quite
germaine to his subject.
He nevertheless paints a picture that is very attractive. One
wants to believe it, for it explains so many things. Intellectual hon-

72


The True Story of Human Evolutionary Genesis

esty, however, prevents anyone with common sense and access to archeological and astronomical data from taking his book seriously. In the end, I think he’s just another clever huckster making a living selling books that treat folks to a tale they want to believe in. There are plenty of other sleazy, pseudo-intellectuals out there doing the same thing.

Part 4

Sitchin Supporters




With Sitchin’s ideas of ancient astronauts, we are witnessing the validation of Victor Hugo's observation in the 1800s that


more powerful than the march of mighty armies is an idea whose time has come.

In the course of centuries, Man has elevated his status against
Nature.
The Mining Era has depleted the ores of the Earth. Industry
has consumed too much energy and polluted the atmosphere.
The Atomic Age has cracked the secrets of the atoms of uranium.
Our society has fallen ill. Crisis of global proportions in all fields
of human endeavor is at hand.
The Anunnakis had similar problems. Broken ozone layer.
Depleted gold mines. Threat of annihilation by global atomic
war.
What lessons can we learn from their legacy? Will their an-
cient history become our mirror to the future?

Chapter One
Michael Tellinger




Michael Tellinger, author, scientist, explorer, has become a reallife Indiana Jones, making groundbreaking discoveries about ancient vanished civilizations at the southern tip of Africa. His continued efforts and analytical scientific approach have produced stunning new evidence that will force us to rethink our origins and rewrite our history books Michael Tellinger skillfully describes some of the most interesting technologies that the vanished civilizations of southern Africa pioneered:
A vast network of hubs
There are around 10 million ancient stone circles in South Africa,
all connected by stone channels, which historians originally thought
were designed for cattle. Tellinger suggests these structures were
used for gold mining instigated by the Anunnaki (a group of Sumer-
ian gods), who created a slave race by genetically tinkering with in-
digenous proto-humans.
Singing stones
The extremely hard hornfels stone, which Tellinger believes was
brought to the area for the express purpose of creating the monu-
ments, has rich tonal qualities and vibrant musicality.
Adam’s calendar
This monolithic stone calendar marks time out by the day—
and should be on everyone’s bucket list of places to see. Tellinger
believes that it’s the oldest manmade structure on earth, dating
back at least 75,000 years. The calendar, he says, is still accurate
today.

What happens in the circle stays in the circle
Ground-penetrating radar and other tests of the ruins have re-
vealed numerous anomalies, Tellinger reports, such as electromag-
netic waves inside the circles and intense heat signatures.

Chapter Two
Marshall Klarfeld




Author Marshall Klarfeld shared his contention that a group of ETs known as the Anunnaki visited Earth and genetically altered hu- mans. Basing some of his suppositions on the work of Zecharia Sitchin who translated ancient cuneiform tablets of the Sumerians, Klarfeld said the Anunnaki arrived from the rogue planet Niburi, which is on a 3600-year orbit in our solar system. As they needed gold to repair their planet’s atmosphere, the Anunnaki decided to alter Homo erectus into a new species—Homo sapiens, so they could serve as miners for them, he explained.
We were “jump-started” as a species 250,000 years ago, and are all descendents of the Anunnaki, Klarfeld asserted. As evidence of their visitations, he cited various ancient endeavors that he said could not have been constructed by humans alone at that time, in- cluding Stonehenge, the huge Baalbek platform in Lebanon, the Giza pyramids, Earth Island statues, the Mitchell-Hedges Crystal Skull, the Nazca Lines, and cylinder seals.
In regards to the Nazca Lines, he shared his new theory: “They are one gigantic time capsule,” left more than 3,000 years ago. The figures in the Peruvian desert correspond to the configuration of stars in Orion’s belt.

Chapter Three
Lloyd Pye




Lloyd Pye has this to say:
In contrast, Interventionists like me anchor our search for origins on
evidence rather than faith, on logic rather than magic. We don’t think that
God did it, or that life spontaneously generated.
For us, evidence and logic point to the same “outside intervention” In-
telligent Designers see. However, where they feel the only outside source
of intervention must be God (whom they are careful to not mention by
name), we suggest another, bolder explanation: “They did it!”
Who are “They?” The currently favored term is aliens—nonhuman,
non-Earth-based entities.
Of course, aliens raises the hackles and blood pressure of science, gov-
ernment, and religion, so to calm them, I will later provide a different, less
threatening term. That new term describes entities who have created and
distributed, then overseen and managed, life’s myriad forms.
Mainstream scientists say extraordinary claims require extraordinary
evidence. Clearly, the Intervention Theory makes several super-extraordinary
claims, so we need a great deal of extraordinary evidence. Do we have it?
That human life emerged from primitive hair-covered hominoids (up-
right walking apes) after human-like entities (aliens or gods, with a small
“g”) intervened genetically (with test tubes) to create a new hybrid being
(humans) with genes from themselves and the primitive hominoids.
The sad truth is that in every field of science, Young Turks have to
serve their leaders when those leaders are the oldest, crustiest, and most
conservative members of the field. Then, when those old “defenders of the
faith” die out, what were once Young Turks take over for them and are
forced to defend the same bankrupt faith.

Chapter Four
Crop Circle Evidences Relating to Anunnaki




Genuine crop circles as opposed to man-made hoaxes carry valuable knowledge and lessons for humanity. Using energy comprising of light, sound, and magnetism on plant mediums such as wheat, bar- ley, canola, trees, ice, rice paddies, even linseed, the crop circles serve as a vast repository of information on
•    Astronomical Events
•    Scientific Frontiers and Puzzles
•    Human Progress and Enlightenment
•    Planet Earth Future Trends
Besides the single interpretation for each of the crop circles, there are also many connections between crop circles that have appeared in more than thirty-five countries. They are not just the Anunnaki’s crossword puzzle; there are many sub messages and themes in the context of the main messages that are powerful and inspirational. To those in the know or bothered to spend enormous amount of time to find out, they anticipate much more to come.
A task as monumental as the discovery of the structure of DNA, unraveling each unique message of the crop circles may require you to cross reference designs in ten countries. Sometimes, there is only one profound discussion topic for the latest crop circle season.

Part 5

What We Used to Believe




Many of our modern experts project tremendous confidence.  We have many financial experts, political experts, religious experts who have marvelous credentials. They can be very charismatic — some- times their voice just projects it.  It really sort of lulls us into a false sense of security by accepting what they say as the truth. It can take a while to actually think about it and realize their advice makes no sense at all.
Are we essentially just blindly following experts?
Scientists and other experts are human beings, they want to ad-
vance their careers, they have families to support, and what do you
know, they tend to get the answers they chase after. The problem
is, how can we make sure that when they're editing the data, they're
not simply manipulating the data in the way that helps them end
up with the conclusion they always wanted?
The wars for truths are fought relentlessly and ruthlessly over
generations. Fear cannot save us. Rage cannot help us. What mis-
fortune or bliss does ignorance hold in store for us in the next hun-
dred years? There is no sound, no voice, no cry in all the world that
can be heard about the truth...until someone listens.










85





















Chapter One
Inertia, Indifference, and Ignorance




It is evident in our history that scientific and technological progress has been retarded by authoritative persons who have declared in- novations and inventions to be either wrong or of no practical use. Many pioneers of discovery had spent their lifetimes trying to con- vince others what they knew or found, only to fall upon deaf ears most of the times. Even after the preponderance of evidences was raised, people could still be in denial.
Most forefront thinkers or scientists were first ridiculed, and then vehemently opposed with strong support from the masses of ignorant populace using insufficient logical reasoning, incomplete careful analysis, and inexhaustive evidence. After costly mistakes were made, progress was impeded, situation worsened, then people turned back to those supposedly outrageous claims and concluded that the evidence was too much to not acknowledge. From then on, the idea or discovery was thought as self-evident truth.
Let us not forget the following facts:
•	For centuries, most societies believe the earth is flat. All the authorities and leaders in various disciplines from most cultures were the guardians of this faith. China held this belief until as late as the seventeenth century.
•	We are the same people who used to believe that mon- sters lived at the edge of the earth.
•	We are the same people who used to believe sponta- neous generation of life was possible—until Luis Pas- teur’s experiment in the nineteenth century.
•    We are the same people who used to believe the earth

was immersed in luminous ether, before it was discov- ered that light waves propagate through space.
•	We are the same people who used to believe flying was not possible until December 17, 1903, when the Wright Brothers did it against numerous critics.
•	God’s Particles are around for billions of years but we only started to know they exist in Jul 2012!
•	In 1970, plate tectonics replaced our old belief that the earth was expanding and causing the fault lines.
•	First asteroid companion of Earth, 2010 TK7, was only discovered in 2010.
I think it’s evident that times are changing and while some things were dead on, some just want to be blown open with new discoveries.
The discoveries made out of the Sumerian clay tablets are well- suited to anyone—professionals and amateurs, science buffs and historians, pioneers and followers. Depending on the extent of your engagement, it can be overwhelming or it can be entertaining. It can lead to the Grand Truth, or it can lead to elements of fringe with new discoveries made directly, accidentally, or even somewhere else not at all related.
One the one hand, we have the Impossibilist Camp, who decry foul at every opportunity. On the other hand, we have authoritative persons who, throughout history, have labeled all innovations and inventions as Fringe Sciences unworthy of serious investigation by mainstream science.
The irrational resistance to change and the desperate attempt to cling to our safety shell lies in our inherent arrogance and ignorance, sense and sensibility. It is said that our civilization has made progress in leaps and bounds. It can also be said that misjudgment and ignorance have impeded and prevented progress be made in leaps and bounds.
Who should be made into the laughingstock? The clown? The comedian? The scholar? The scientist? Ourselves? Many in- ventors died unheralded. Many succumbed to the skepticism and ridicule that were piled upon them from all kinds of direc- tions.
Many armchair critics are marked by cynicism and the manip- ulation of data to fit their personal beliefs. Scientific theories that were once right and mighty had been proven wrong later. This is the case even with the best and most thorough scientific scrutiny

and investigation. There is no knowing when a better scientific the- ory will come out to replace the old.
It is clear that the Sumerian clay tablets study will continue to interest areas of science, history, archaeology, cosmology, etc. due to its continued “effect” of encompassing studies from unrelated fields.
What might be the beauty of Sitchin’s theory is that it gives peo- ple, scientists, and scholars the confidence to create new theories and discover new findings, even though the final and conclusive proof may still be unknown or unaccepted by the populace or sci- entific mainstream.

Chapter Two
The Conversation with the Wright Brothers in 1902, Just before Their Important Breakthough




If we go back to 1902, with all the knowledge we have about flying and aerodynamics, will we find any person who can be convinced that flying is possible, let alone who can be convinced that man would be on the brink of flying through the air at the speed of sound? Can we even convince the Wright Brothers? Maybe not.

Wright Brothers:   Well, Mr. Flying, if your motorized craft can go faster than the speed of sound, why isn’t your flimsy craft torn to pieces by the wind? Besides, the human body cannot take strong acceleration, according to the laws of nature.
Mr. Flying:             It is possible to pass the sound barrier by design- ing the wings and body to move the shock wave down the plane as you surpass the speed of sound.
Wright Brothers:   How do you make wings with enough lifting power? How do you avoid the airplane spinning out of control by the wing warping mechanism?
Mr. Flying:             Combinations of aluminum, magnesium, and small amounts of copper and manganese make a light but strong alloy called duralumin, which is suitable for airplane parts.
Wright Brothers:   Really? Planes made of alloy? Well, if your plane can fly faster than sound, then why don’t you just fly to the moon?
Mr. Flying:             Trained astronauts in a space shuttle can do that,

not an airplane.
Wright Brothers:   I see. Fly to the moon in a space shuttle? Man will
probably not fly in their lifetime. Not in an air-
plane or space shuttle. Is that a fantasy?
Mr. Flying:             Perhaps, perhaps not.

Chapter Three
Physical Center of the Universe and
Biological Center of the Universe




Geocentricity is the belief and teaching that the earth is the center of the solar system and/or the universe.
Because we have huge egos, we believe everything revolves around us until 500 years ago.
Because human vanity knows no limits, we want to believe we are the epitome of developed species, the most advanced, intelli- gent, and civilized. That is, until The Human Genome Project shocked us with some real surprises.
The first surprise was the vast percentage—at least 97 percent—
of the human DNA is inactive, thus termed “junk DNA.”
The second surprise was that even though we seem to have the
longest DNA molecule among all other species, we use the smallest
fraction of it in relation to the other species. Both of these issues raise
the question of efficiency of our DNA evolution.
We would expect that humans should end up having most
genes, but strangely, this is not the case.

We would also expect that humans should end up having the biggest genome, but strangely, this is not the case either.

Marbled lungfish                                     132.83
Human                                                       3.0
Encephalitozoon intestinalis parasite        0.03

The time has again come for us to dispel our mystic belief that we are the ultimate prize of Creation, evolution, or intelligent de- sign.
We can then fairly say, “Genome size does not correlate with evolutionary status, nor is the number of genes proportionate with genome size.”
Then, what are the consequences of such a large genome, and does it really matters if one organism has more DNA than another?
The consequences operate at all levels, from the cell up to the whole organism, and beyond. In plants, research has demonstrated that those with large genomes are at greater risk of extinction, are less adapted to living in polluted soils, and are less able to tolerate extreme environmental conditions—all highly relevant in today’s changing world.
Another example of the significance and importance of genome size in both animals and plants is the fact that the more DNA there is in a genome, the longer it takes for a cell to copy all its DNA and divide. The knock-on effect of this is that it can take longer for an organism with a larger genome to complete its life cycle than one with a small genome. It is no coincidence that living in deserts, many plants that must grow quickly after rains have small genomes, enabling them to grow rapidly. In contrast, species with large genomes grow much more slowly and are excluded from such habitats.
Genome size is also positively correlated with nuclear size (The more DNA you have, the more space you need for it.), and, in many cases, also with cell size, which can have knock-on consequences at the whole organism level.

Prior to the current genomic era, it was suggested that the num- ber of protein-coding genes that an organism made use of was a valid measure of its complexity. It is now clear, however, that major incongruities exist and that there is only a weak relationship be- tween biological complexity and the number of protein coding genes. For example, using the protein-coding gene number as a basis for evaluating biological complexity would make urochor- dates and insects less complex than nematodes, and humans less complex than rice. Increasing biological complexity is positively cor- related with the relative genomewide expansion of nonprotein-cod- ing DNA sequences.

Chapter Four
History Is Wrong




History is collective memory; yet, even our own memory errs at times, and no real memory extends beyond three generations. There are written sources, but each one of those might easily prove a for- gery. There are material remnants of archaeological nature, but they may be misdated and misinterpreted.
The extended history of man living in caves, inventing tools, and forming the first human society took too long for it to come to pass as a real civilization. Therefore, using Occam’s razor principle, the formation of human civilization must be due to an external agent. Anatoly Timofeevich Fomenko is a Soviet and Russian mathemati- cian, professor at Moscow State University. He is well known as a topologist, and a full member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. He is a supporter of revising historical chronology. In his book— History: Fiction or Science? Chronology No. 1, 2, 3 Anatoly Fomenko set up to prove history, especially global history is wrong.
He even goes further to say that basically, everything we are told about history pre-1600 is BS.
Fomenko uses astronomy data to support his argument that his- tory is too long and that many historical events happened more re- cently than we thought. He claims that astronomy is precise by definition, and a historical dating that can be calculated from infor- mation about eclipses should satisfy any researcher. He asks the question: “Which is more reliable - history or hard-boiled scientific facts?” Science cannot afford subjectivity; most of us would feel the same way about history as well. Chronological problems are very serious indeed.

Chapter Five
The fates of Human Societies




In the book Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, Jared Diamond effectively, coherently, fundamentally, definitively, and entertainingly explains the world’s history of the preceding 15,000 years, where the first societies of humans first appeared. He also analyses how the divergent paths taken by these societies had re- sulted in the pecking order of different cultures in the world today.
He proves that the Eurasian land mass had by far the best bio- logical resources with which to develop agricultural societies, and was thus more able to form large, coherent, and powerful social en- tities. Certain kinds of plants and animals are necessary to support a farming society. He investigates the biological resources available to potential farmers in all parts of the world. The people of Eurasia had access to a suite of plants and domesticated animals that pro- vided for their needs. Potential farmers in other parts of the world didn’t—and so their fertile soil went untilled. After establishing this strong agricultural foundation, the formation of large-scale societies became possible.
His expose is close to the truth. However, Will Hart in his book
The Genesis Race argued that:
Our guts are still not adapted to digest uncooked grains. After
all, we are not birds.
Our Paleolithic ancestors lacked the technology to harvest,
thresh, process, and cook wild grass seeds. The seeds of wild species
are miniscule and they are attached to the seed heads, making them
difficult to harvest and hardly worth the effort.
If they lacked an extended experience with wild grasses, how

97


Elvis Newman

did they know which ones to select to turn into wheat, rye, corn, barely, and rice? In other words, these are still the principal food crops that our civilizations are based upon.
After at least 5,000 years of continuous agriculture, we do not seem to have improved upon the first selections of food crops of our scientifically ignorant ancestors. That hardly seems logical.
This amazingly prescient selection of wild seeds seems not only more than a little surprising, it looks to border on being a minor mir- acle. There are an estimated 195,000 flowering plants that they could have turned into food sources and primitive man chose less than.01 to base agriculture upon.
The earliest human societies happened at a point in time when people had no concept of domesticating plants or animals, which means no experience with artificial selection.
Will Hart concluded that the Anunnakis brought domesticated plants and animals for humans.

Part 6 

Pseudo Science, Proto Science, True Science




In Man’s conquest of progress, his own prejudice and ignorance must be the first to surrender. From there, he will step his way across the heavens to the edge of infinity. No doubt he will stumble and fumble. Each step will be as uncertain as the last, yet each will bring him closer to ultimate truth. Throughout history, a handful of brave scientists and technicians pave the way to the future. Their mission: to collect information that will eventually enable man to step into the better world of tomorrow, to use their present knowhow as a springboard to the brave new world that they dare not imagine. They make their slow, uncharted way across the waters of mysticism, pseudoscience, and the paranormal of their times. The water’s sur- face has depths and dangers that are, as yet, unprobed . . .
It is with these people that our new world has come to being, mapped, chartered, and indexed . . .
If we accept the tenuous fragility of modern progress through trial and error, misfortunes and sacrifice, perhaps we can begin the second dawning of humankind . . . today.

Chapter One
Alchemy and The Periodic Table




Alchemy
Alchemy, started as a pseudo science, evolved into a proto- science, which then displayed the transformation from theoretical dogma to the observation and practice-based methods that gradu- ally developed into a true science. In fact, it can be argued that, in terms of the development of science, the alchemists were further ahead than many other disciplines.
In it’s infant stage, alchemy became notorious for attracting tricksters and fraudsters. Many so-called alchemists claimed that they had produced gold from base metals as a means to attract spon- sorship or court favor, but most used magician’s tricks and misdi- rection to switch base metals with gold. In the dream of finding riches, everyone—from popes and kings to peasants—practice the art and try to change base metal into gold.
To obtain gold with the most efficient methodology and tech- nique, many later alchemists conducted controlled experiments and used trial and error to discover the nature of substances, studying how they reacted, interacted, and changed under new conditions, thereby laying the foundations for chemistry. Alchemists correctly observed phenomenon, came very close to the truth with astute ob- servations, but slipped into the occult and spirituality.
After shifting the administration of cures away from herbalism and mysticism, religion, and theology, alchemy began to take a dif- ferent direction and move towards science. Alchemists generated a hypothesis and tested it; if it did not work, they refined their ideas and retested, a process intimately familiar to most modern scien-

101


Elvis Newman

tists.
In time, alchemists moved away from uncovering knowledge
for the sake of knowledge and the discipline of alchemy became
linked to physics, metallurgy, medicine, and pharmacology. It be-
came a true science.

Periodic Table
In 1869, the Russian chemistry professor Dmitri Mendeleev de- veloped the first Periodic Table. He organized the sixty-three then known elements into groups with similar properties and left some spaces blank for those whose existence he could not yet prove. Chemists then began filling in the blanks and started the search for missing elements. The Table was later reorganized using atomic number instead of atomic weight by physicist Henry Moseley in
1913. The expansion of the table supports the idea that as-yet-undis- covered stable or artificial elements exist, which in turn supports the expansion of the Periodic Table. No one knows for sure if the Periodic Table is ever going to be completed.

Conclusion
The story of Alchemy and the Periodic Table find many paral- lels in Darwin’s Theory. Sitchin’s Theory will prove to be even more challenging and profound.

Chapter Two
The Interesting Stories Behind
Discovery of Neptune and Pluto




It was perturbations in Uranus’s motion that led to the discovery of
Neptune.
Astronomers had noticed increasing errors in their models for
the orbit of Uranus and eventually ruled out many explanations be-
sides an outer planet that could be perturbing its orbit.
In 1846, the planet Neptune was discovered after its existence
was predicted. This precise prediction of the new planet and its lo-
cation was striking confirmation of the power of Newton’s theory
of gravitation.
Later, similar calculations on supposed perturbations of the or-
bits of Uranus and Neptune suggested the presence of yet another
planet beyond the orbit of Neptune. Eventually, in 1930, a new
planet, Pluto, was discovered.
We have even more amazing discoveries recently:
A trans-Neptunian object is any object in the solar system that
orbits the sun at a greater average distance than Neptune.

Sedna
90377 Sedna is a large trans-Neptunian object, which, as of 2012, was about three times as far from the sun as Neptune. For most of its orbit, it is even farther from the sun than at present, with its aphelion estimated at 937 astronomical units, making it one of the most distant known objects in the solar system other than long period comets. Sedna’s exceptionally long and elongated orbit, taking approximately
11,400 years to complete, and distant point of closest approach to the sun, at 76 AU, have led to much speculation as to its origin.

103


Elvis Newman

Eris, Pluto, Makemake, and Haumea
As of November 2009, two hundred trans-Neptunian objects have their orbits well enough determined that they have been given a permanent minor planet designation.
The largest known trans-Neptunian objects are Eris and Pluto, followed by Makemake and Haumea. The Kuiper belt, scattered disk, and Oort cloud are three conventional divisions of this volume of space.

Comet Lovejoy
Comet Lovejoy is a long-period comet and Kreutz Sungrazer. It was discovered in November 2011 by Australian amateur as- tronomer Terry Lovejoy. The comet’s perihelion took it through the sun’s corona on 16 December 2011, after which it emerged intact and continued on its orbit to the outer solar system. In the process, it astounded all scientists.

Comet 96P/Machholz 1
Comet 96P/Machholz last came to perihelion on July 14, 2012 and will next come to perihelion on October 27, 2017. 96P/Machholz has an estimated radius of around 3.2 km. Machholz 1 is unusual among comets in several respects. Its highly eccentric 5.2-year orbit has the smallest perihelion distance known among numbered/reg- ular short-period comets, bringing it considerably closer to the sun than the orbit of Mercury.

Conclusion
Sitchin’s interpretation may lead us into accidental discovery of something new, not necessarily the discovery of Nibiru. He opened our minds to binary star systems, elliptical orbits, and Super Earths. Sitchin allowed us to understand Comet Lovejoy. Comet Lovejoy emerged intact from the Sun’s corona on 16 December 2011 and con- tinued on its orbit to the outer Solar System, astounding all scien- tists.

Chapter Three
Faulty Maps to India Led Christopher Columbus to the New Continent




Columbus had dreamed of sailing across the world since he was a young boy, to see if one really would “fall off” the ends of the earth.
During the decade before 1492, as Columbus nursed a grow- ing urge to sail west to the Indies—as the lands of China, Japan, and India were then known in Europe—he was studying the old writers to find out what the world and its people were like. He read the Ymago Mundi of Pierre d’Ailly, a French cardinal who wrote in the early fifteenth century, the travels of Marco Polo and of Sir John Mandeville, Pliny’s Natural History, and the Historia Rerum Ubique Gestarum of Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini (Pope Pius II).
Columbus (and most everyone else) already knew the Earth was round. Columbus actually thought the planet was pearshaped. What was in question, however, was the Earth’s circumference. Upon mapping his route, Columbus underestimated the distance to Asia by thousands of miles because he used obsolete Greek data to make his calculations.
He also decided that Spain was closer to China westward than eastward and had never abandoned this conviction.
After years of preparation for his first voyage, Columbus did approach—and was turned down by—the kings of Portugal, France, and England for funding.
The discovery of North America was not philosophical in nature at all, because Columbus’s intention was to find a faster trade route to China and India, in order to acquire more economic status by shortening the route. Finding the Americas was purely an accident.


105


Elvis Newman

However, as is frequently noted on this day, when Columbus landed, natives already inhabited the land. He called them Indians because he initially thought he had reached India.
It is written in many historical texts that Columbus and his men may have been responsible for introducing syphilis to Europe. There is new genetic evidence supporting this theory. Columbus and his men are believed to have brought the disease, which is sexually transmitted, to Europe in 1493. An estimated five million people died in Europe as a result of a massive syphilis epidemic.


The world map of Behaim


Conclusion
If Sitchin’s critics are right, we still have Sitchin looking like Columbus with faulty maps in his hands. Even though guided by faulty data, a great Discovery is still expected. There is still much to be gained from Sitchin’s work.

Chapter Four
Galileo, Your Best Bet is to be Born after Newton




Sir Isaac Newton, born on December 25, 1642, was an English physi- cist, mathematician, astronomer, natural philosopher, alchemist, and theologian who has been considered by many to be the greatest and most influential scientist who ever lived.
Galileo Galilei, born on February 15, 1564, was an Italian scien- tist who supported Copernicanism, the idea that Earth orbits the sun. Galileo defended his views in Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems. For doing so, he was tried by the Roman In- quisition, was found “suspect of heresy” and spent the rest of his life under house arrest. His findings changed our world view for all time. Galileo died a natural death in the year 1642. He was seventy- seven years old and was serving his life imprisonment sentence in Arcetri when he died.
In fact, Newton did not discover gravity. It was actually Galileo. Galileo dropped different weight objects from the Tower of Pisa and noted they all fell at the same rate, and he did many other experi- ments along these lines.
In fact, Galileo died a year before Newton was born. What if Galileo Galilei were born after Sir Isaac Newton? Galileo Galilei would have had an easier life if he were born after
Sir Isaac Newton. With the discovery of gravitational pull, it could be demonstrated easily that the earth rotated around the sun. And he wouldn’t have spent the rest of his life under house arrest.
Sometimes, some truths or discoveries come too early, especially for people who are indifferent, arrogant, and ignorant. Politics, greed, and an irrational resistance to change have prompted people

108


The True Story of Human Evolutionary Genesis

to denounce the latest discovery or technical innovation as rubbish, often as a knee-jerk reaction. Egos, vested interests, politics, moral and religious objections, and evasion of responsibility are all under- lying factors to the fact that many beneficial discoveries have been swept under the carpet.
Many, many lives that could be saved with the latest discoveries and inventions have been lost with the latest findings suppressed and the inventor dying unheralded. Inventors often need a great deal of tenacity, as well as vision, to overcome the skepticism and ridicule that come as an avalanche. Sometimes discoverers and in- ventors are persecuted. A breakthrough would have far-reaching consequences for the entire religious sector based on Galileo Galilei’s work—which, in itself, may be the problem. Until a very long time after his death, his books were banned and his writings and findings were considered deviant, false and of the devil.
Now who is to say what discoveries should come earlier than others?

Conclusion
Sitchin may be a hoax in some people’s eyes. We might not value what he has to offer us now. In time, when other scientific discov- eries are made, they may exonerate Sitchin. To Sitchin’s critics, who would like to see his books banned and his writings and findings considered deviant and false, they really need to appreciate how Sitchin’s findings have changed our world view for all time.

Chapter Five
“Hi, Roman Citizens,  . . . Rome Is Not the Only Mighty Empire in the World !”




“You call yourself the greatest empire in existence. Do you believe there exists an empire called the Chinese Empire, which is at least as large if not bigger than the Roman Empire?”
“You are most proud of your architectural achievements. Do you know there are pyramids that are very much harder to con- struct?”
“Other than the Romans and barbarians, do you know of the ex- istence of the Eskimos, American Indians, Australian Aborigines . .
. ?”
“Do you believe your Roman scholars and authorities know most of everything? Do you have many financial crises? Social In- equalities?”
“Would you believe in some strange lands, strange people, strange ideas, and strange discoveries if your Roman scholars and authorities told you not to?”
“Do you know Korea? The country has been in existence for thousands of years!”
Well, the last question is too hard. Many Americans did not even know Korea existed until the American government decided to send troops to Korea in the Korean War, despite the fact that the country has been in existence for thousands of years!
With these facts in mind, how are we even sure on what we know, or for that matter, what we don’t know?

Conclusion
Sitchin was trying hard to tell us something we don’t know.

Chapter Six
Humans as the Hybrids of Homo Erectus and Anunnaki




A chimera or chimaera is a single organism (usually an animal) that is composed of two or more different populations of genetically dis- tinct cells that originated from different zygotes involved in sexual reproduction. If the different cells have emerged from the same zy- gote, the organism is called a mosaic. Chimeras are formed from at least four parent cells (two fertilized eggs or early embryos fused together). Each population of cells keeps its own character and the resulting organism is a mixture of tissues.

Tigon

Hybrid Animals
Lions and tigers do not exist in the same area, so hybrids of the two would never ever happen in the wild.
Ligers and tigons suffer hundreds of birth defects, and usually die young, and painfully. This just shows they are not meant to be born at all.
The female tiger who has to give birth to the young ligers is put at risk too, as the ligers are bigger than her normal cubs would be; she has to have an operation to take them out.
If ligers don’t die when they are young, as they grow, their bones don’t stop growing, and they become deformed, they are in pain their whole lives. And if they reach and age where they can breed, they are unable to. They can not reproduce, so the reason every animal is here is taken away from it; the opportunity to breed is taken away. So other than show, there is no point to these ani- mals.
Dissociative identity disorder (DID), also known as multiple personality disorder (MPD),is a mental disorder characterized by at least two distinct and relatively enduring identities or dissociated personality states that alternately control a person’s behavior, and

is accompanied by memory impairment for important information not explained by ordinary forgetfulness. These symptoms are not accounted for by substance abuse, seizures, other medical condi- tions, or imaginative play in children. This mental disorder is found prevalently in many hybrid animals.

Conclusion
If we believe Sitchin’s theory that we are genetically engineered hybrids, then at once the questions of humanity’s Good versus Evil, constant conflicting emotional states, neurological disorders, junk DNAs, and many human medical curiosities can all be solved.

Abhorrent Types of Experimental Hominoids






Elongated Skulls at the Museo Inka (Incan Museum) in Cusco, Peru

mal bones, and other signs of existence from these haircovered bipeds.
According to Lloyd Pye, Hominoids are known to come in four basic types defined by size:
Bigfoot/Sasquatch are by far the most famous at 7 to 10 feet tall, weighing 700 to 1000 pounds. They live in the deep, dense montane forests that surround the earth at high elevations in temperate lati- tudes.
Abominable Snowman/Yeti types are human-sized but far more robust than humans, at 5 to 7 feet tall, weighing 500 to 700 pounds. They seem to live only in valleys in the Himalayan Moun- tain ranges, a combined area as large as the U. S. They are the most primate-like of the four main types, with similarities to chimps and gorillas in physiology and temperament.




115


Elvis Newman

Alma/Kaptar types are also human-sized, at 5 to 7 feet tall and weighing 500 to 700 pounds, and also living in dense forests around the world, but at lower elevations than bigfoot/sasquatch types. They are the most human-like of the three large types, and I person- ally suspect these types will prove to be living Neanderthals.
Agogwe/Sedapa types are pygmy-sized at 3 to 4 feet tall and weighing 200 to 300 pounds, living in the thick sweeps of jungles that surround the earth along its equatorial regions. They seem to live in small groups or “tribes,” whereas the other three types are believed to function mostly as small independent family units.
The key point to make about these animals, and about the many other variations of names given to them around the world, is that such names simply would not exist if the creatures they are meant to describe did not exist. Where there is so incredibly much smoke, described in details that correspond astonishingly wherever they are found, surely it means a fire is burning, a fire whose flames will eventually reach and consume those who insist it can’t be real.

Genesis Revisited: A Scientific Creation Story
December 2001 Michael Shermer

The opening chapters of Genesis will have to be revised to accom- modate modern scientific theories and data.
In the beginning—specifically on October 23, 4004 B.C., at noon—out of quantum foam fluctuation, God created the Big Bang. The bang was followed by cosmological inflation. God saw that the Big Bang was very big, too big for creatures that could worship him, so He created the earth. And darkness was upon the face of the deep, so He commanded hydrogen atoms (which He created out of quarks and other subatomic goodies) to fuse and become helium atoms and in the process release energy in the form of light. And the light maker he called the sun, and the process He called fusion. And He saw the light was good because now He could see what he was doing. And the evening and the morning were the first day. And God said, “Let there be lots of fusion light makers in the sky.” Some of these fusion makers appear to be more than 4,004 light years from Earth. In fact, some of the fusion makers He grouped into collections He called galaxies, and these appeared to be millions and even billions of light years from Earth, so He created “tired light”—light that slows down through space—so that the 4004 B.C. creation myth might be preserved. And created He many wondrous splendors, including red giants, white dwarfs, quasars, pulsars, nova and supernova, worm holes, and even black holes, out of which nothing can escape. But since God cannot be constrained by

nothing (can God make a planet so big that he could not lift it?), He created Hawking radiation, through which information can escape from Black Holes. This made God even more tired than tired light, and the evening and the morning were the second day.
And God said, “Let the waters under the heavens be gathered to- gether unto one place, and let the continents drift apart by plate tec- tonics.” He decreed sea floor spreading would create zones of emergence, and He caused subduction zones to build mountains and cause earthquakes. In weak points in the crust, God created volcanic islands, where the next day He would place organisms that were sim- ilar to but different from their relatives on the continents, so that still later created creatures called humans would mistake them for evolved descendants. And in the land, God placed fossil fuels, natural gas, and other natural resources for humans to exploit, but not until after Day Six. And the evening and the morning were the third day.
And God saw that the land was lonely, so He created animals bearing their own kind, declaring, “Thou shalt not evolve into new species, and thy equilibrium shall not be punctuated.” And God placed into the land’s strata fossils that appeared older than 4004
B.C. And the sequence resembled descent with modification. And the evening and morning were the fourth day.
And God said, “Let the waters bring forth abundantly the mov- ing creatures that hath life, the fishes.” And God created great whales whose skeletal structure and physiology were homologous with the land mammals he would create later that day. Since this caused confusion in the valley of the shadow of doubt God brought forth abundantly all creatures, great and small, declaring that mi- croevolution was permitted, but not macroevolution. And God said, “Natura non facit saltum”—Nature shall not make leaps. And the evening and morning were the fifth day.
And God created the pongidids and hominids with 98 percent genetic similarity, naming two of them Adam and Eve, who were anatomically fully modern humans. In the book in which God ex- plained how He did all this, in chapter one He said he created Adam and Eve together out of the dust at the same time, but in chapter two He said He created Adam first, then later created Eve out of one of Adam’s ribs. This caused further confusion in the valley of the shadow of doubt, so God created Bible scholars and theologians to argue the point.
And in the ground placed He in abundance teeth, jaws, skulls, and pelvises of transitional fossils from pre-Adamite creatures. One

he chose as his special creation He named Lucy. And God realized this was confusing, so he created paleoanthropologists to sort it out. And just as He was finishing up the loose ends of the creation, God realized that Adam’s immediate descendants who lived as farmers and herders would not understand inflationary cosmology, global general relativity, quantum mechanics, astrophysics, biochemistry, paleontology, population genetics, and evolutionary theory, so He created creation myths. But there were so many creation stories throughout the land that God realized this too was confusing, so he created anthropologists, folklorists, and mythologists to settle the issue.
By now the valley of the shadow of doubt was overrunneth with skepticism, so God became angry, so angry that God lost His temper and cursed the first humans, telling them to go forth and multiply (but not in those words). They took God literally and 6,000 years later there are six billion humans. And the evening and morning were the sixth day.
By now God was tired, so God said, “Thank me its Friday,” and
He made the weekend. It was a good idea.

Conclusion
It is up to anyone to draw his or her own conclusion.

Chapter Nine
Difficulties in Darwin’s Theory




Does Absolute Truth Exist? Are You Absolutely Sure?
The work of the nineteenth-century English naturalist, Charles Darwin shocked society and revolutionized science. One of the most influential books in modern history, The Origin of Species has helped shape philosophy, biology, sociology, and religion in the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries. But both Darwin’s theory and his book contain some major flaws.
In The Origin of Species Chapter 6: Difficulties on Theory, Darwin stated:
On the absence or rarity of transitional varieties.
But, as by this theory, innumerable transitional forms must have
existed, why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers
in the crust of the earth?
On the origin and transitions of organic beings with peculiar
habits and structure.
It has been asked by the opponents of such views as I hold, how,
for instance, a land carnivorous animal could have been converted
into one with aquatic habits; for how could the animal in its transi-
tional state have subsisted?
Organs of extreme perfection and complication.
To suppose that the eye, with all its inimitable contrivances for
adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different
amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic
aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I
freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree.

The True Story of Human Evolutionary Genesis

Natural Selection is Naturally Wrong
We have eyeballs with retinas and rods and corneas, but so do giant squid.
We do not see fossil examples of animals going from one kind to another, not even one transitional form has ever been found.
Most of the arguments Darwin used to sustain his theory are re- jected by evolutionists of today. The new evolutionists look at the very same facts and reach radically different conclusions because they bring to the table different lenses through which they interpret those facts in support of evolution.

Human Evolution Is a Theory in Crisis
Darwin claimed that human beings evolved from apes. Today, scientists found out that the similarity (between man and chimps) is now down to about 93 percent, according to more recent stud- ies—results that curiously have not made many headlines. Stephan Anitei, science editor for Softpedia, writes: “Well, the new study con- cludes that the total DNA variation between humans and chim- panzees is rather 6-7 percent. There are obvious similarities between chimpanzees and humans, but also high differences in body struc- ture, brain, intellect, and behavior, etc.” (“How Much DNA Do We Share With Chimps?” Softpedia, Nov. 20, 2006, p. 1).
Sometimes, two species are close enough to crossbreed, but the offspring are usually sterile. This is the case when horses and don- keys crossbreed. A male donkey (jackass) and a female horse (mare) will produce a mule. Farmers often preferred mules as work animals prior to the development of the farm tractor. A hinny is the offspring of a female donkey (jenny) and a male horse (stallion). The hinny and mule usually cannot produce offspring. These animals show that Human evolution is not possible.
Is the similarity between chimpanzees and men due to a common ancestor? If that is the case, why are human beings so drastically different now from this ancestor while chimpanzees have remained much the same? The fact is we are not seeing any evolution presently going on in either chimpanzees or human beings.
As Jonathan Wells notes: “The most fundamental problem of evolution—the origin of species, remains unsolved. Despite cen- turies of artificial breeding and decades of laboratory experiments, no one has ever observed speciation (the evolution of a species into another species) through variation and selection.

121

There is no scientific evidence that a species can change the number of chromosomes within the DNA. The chromosome count within each species is fixed. This is the reason a male from one species cannot mate successfully with a female of another species. Man could not evolve from a monkey. Each species is locked into its chromosome count that cannot be changed. If an animal devel- oped an extra chromosome or lost a chromosome because of some deformity, it could not successfully mate. The defect could not be passed along to the next generation. Evolving a new species is sci- entifically impossible.
Humans have forty-six chromosomes. This chromosome count is a steady factor. This determines what is called the “fixity of species” because the chromosome count doesn’t vary. People al- ways give birth to people. Dogs always give birth to dogs, etc. The genes can produce variety within the species but cannot result in a different species. Genes allow for people to be short, tall, fat, thin, blond, brunette, etc., but they are still all human beings. The chro- mosomes make crossing of the species an uncrossable barrier. This certainly would hinder any evolution. Dogs cannot breed with cats. This fact stops evolution dead in its tracks.

Different Perspectives
However, upon closer examination from a different perspective, Darwin’s theories have encourage multidisciplinary scientific progress, problem solving ability, and the wide application of some scientific methods.
Progress in many disciplines were made through continuous ac- cumulation and revolutionary processes. Due to his initially outra- geous theory, even more brand new ideas are adopted and old ideas become abandoned. In the wake of his theory, new methods in sci- ence are produced, which are used to produce new truths that in turn spawn new scientific theories, which then are used to produce more methods, which are then used to produce more truths in the physical universe. And so on.
His theory reinforces the continuous model of scientific progress that has been set in motion since the Renaissance.
Darwin didn’t come up with evolution. What made him special was that he was the first guy to give a mechanism for a unified the- ory of evolution in which all of life evolved from a simple-cell or- ganism. And the mechanism he gave was this concept of natural selection, an idea that was sparked at the Galapagos Islands.

The True Story of Human Evolutionary Genesis

Charles Darwin was one of those rare individuals who devoted themselves entirely to the pursuit of knowledge. He was, and re- mains, one of our greatest ever thinkers—the man whose theory of the gradual evolution of living things has changed the way in which most of us see the world in which we live.
Because of him, we see ourselves as part of nature, instead of separate from it and superior to it.
Evolutionary theory is still such a wonderful and far-reaching view of life despite the flaws and lack of a complete body of sup- porting evidences.
Darwin is still generally recognized as the single greatest thinker in the history of biology, whose contributions provided the basis for understanding the immense diversity that characterizes the natural world.
Darwin’s evolution underpins our grasp on how disease-caus- ing organisms evolve and how we can control them with modern medicine. Antibiotic resistance of bacteria and immunity of insects to insecticides are examples of the development of living things by advantageous mutations. HIV—the virus that causes AIDS—natu- rally mutates to form new strains. So as soon as scientists develop an effective drug that can treat it, a new resistant form develops.
In the absence of an all encompassing, multidisciplinary idea, Darwin’s ideas are still workable ideas sometimes in terms of how we understand our relationship with the natural world.

Conclusion
The intelligent Homo sapiens must be intelligently designed. Many guardians of current Darwinian scientific orthodoxy are cast- ing aspersions to prevent these new insights from the Sumerian clay tablets from gaining a fair hearing. Whatever teachings, facts and findings Darwinism and religion have missed or erred, Anunnaki’s Intelligent Design could be our new solution to all that require com- plementation and improvement upon.

Chapter Ten
Sitchin Showed Us the Way




The theory of human evolution is wrong, false, and impossible ; nat- ural selection is naturally wrong.

New Evolutionists Reject Old Evolutionists
It is a well guarded fact that many evolutionists rejected Dar- win’s theory of evolution over twenty years ago. Stephen Jay Gould, a professor at Harvard University and one of the foremost authorities on evolution in the world said, “The extreme rarity of transitional forms (missing links) in the fossil record persists as the trade secret of paleontologists...we view our data as so bad that we never see the very process we profess to study,” (Natural History, Vol. 86). Gould is still an evolutionist; he just rejects much of Darwin’s theory.

New Evolutionists Reject “Lucy,” the Australopithecus
“Lucy” the Australopithecus has been discarded by many evo- lutionists. The Leakeys considered it simply an extinct ape. It stood three feet tall, had arms that hung down to the ankles, and had a brain one third the size of humans. Adrienne Zihlman, U.C. Santa Cruz, said, “Zihlman compares the pigmy chimpanzee to ‘Lucy,’ one of the oldest hominid fossils known, and finds the similarities striking. They are almost identical in body size, in stature, and in brain size...indicates that pygmy chimps use their limbs much the same way Lucy did...,” Science News, Vol. 123, Feb. 5, 1983, p. 89.

Beneficial Functional Genes Can Only Be Added Artificially
Scientists today still cannot find any mechanism in nature that

124

adds a gene to benefit the organism. Darwinists claim we evolved from the simplest form of bacterial life to ever more complex forms of life. The most basic bacteria had less than 500 genes; man has over
22 thousand. In order for bacteria to evolve into man, organisms would have to be able to add genes. But there is no genetic mecha- nism that adds a gene. Mutations change an existing gene but never add a gene. This means there is no mechanism for Darwinian human evolution and this is a fatal flaw in the theory of human evolution.
This is some very strange logic. There is no need for a mecha- nism to add a gene. What is needed is a mechanism to increase the number of genes. There are several mechanisms for this, and in some ways it happens distressingly often. Naturally, in the great majority of cases, this will be a disadvantage, and the organisms af- fected will not be the most fit and will not replace the ‘Normal’ type.
This happens in humans. Down syndrome, which used to be called mongolism, is caused by an extra twenty first chromosome (In some cases, only part of the extra chromosome is present.). This occurs in less than 1 in a 1000 in young mothers (less than thirty years old), but much more frequently in older mothers.
There are many other conditions known that are caused by extra genes in humans. Not all of them are disadvantageous to the same extent.

Chromosome Count Proves Evolution Is Wrong
“DNA is like a computer program, but far, far more advanced than any software we’ve ever created.” Bill Gates, The Road Ahead (Boulder: Blue Penguin, 1996), p. 228.
There are some serious problems for anyone trying to explain how the vast information system of DNA could spontaneously gen- erate a codex and information encoded using said codex. It is intu- itively obvious that codices exist because intelligences create them in order to record information symbolically. DNA does precisely this and thus at least the DNA molecule must have been designed.
When your dog is going to have a litter, don’t worry that she will have a litter of monkeys or cats. She will always have a litter of pup- pies. The fact that she will have puppies was determined when her chromosomes joined with her mate’s chromosomes at conception. You see, a dog has only 22 chromosomes, whereas a monkey has 54 and cats have 38. Half of the total number of chromosomes are con- tained in the female reproductive cells and half are contained in the male, so the exact total number is brought together in the offspring.

Evidence for Adamu
“By analyzing DNA from people in all regions of the world, Spencer Wells has concluded that all humans alive today are de- scended from a single man also known as Y-chromosomal Adam.” Wells wrote the book The Journey of Man: A Genetic Odyssey (2002).

Evidence for Ti-Amat
We “looked at an international assortment of genes and picked up a trail of DNA that led them to a single (individual) woman from whom we are all descended.” “We are finding that humans have very, very shallow genetic roots which go back very recently to one ancestor,” Michael Hammer, University of Arizona, Newsweek, 1-11-
1988
“Regardless of the cause, evolutionists are most concerned about
the effect of a faster mutation rate. For example, researchers have
calculated that ‘mitochondrial Eve’—the woman whose mtDNA
was ancestral to that in all living people—lived 100,000 to 200,000
years ago in Africa. Using the new clock, she would be a mere 6000
years old. No one thinks that’s the case….” Ann Gibbons, “Calibrat-
ing the Mitochondrial Clock,” Science, Jan. 2, 1998, page 28.

Evidence of Creation from a Location
“That indicates that there was an origin in a specific location on the globe and then it spread out from there,” U.S. News and World Report, 12-4-1995.

Conclusion
We have begun the space age. We are all trying to maneuver through a brand-new, unfamiliar landscape using an old map drawn up by religion and Darwin. We need a new guiding principle.
Unaware of the new realities, we are like the last remaining jun- gle fighters of Japan still hiding in the swamps blindly unaware that the war was over decades ago.
“The past history of humanity shows us that each stage of its development necessitate an uprooting and renewing of fundamen- tal beliefs in our scientific, social, philosophic and religious concep- tions.”—M. Plank. Our history is also full of silly mistakes that must make us smile today. Just like new things that happen everyday, another new theory will soon appear, and the new theory that just appeared will be replaced by a newer one, which itself will be re- placed by a better one, and so on ad infinitum…Our history is also

126

full of icons who also made silly mistakes.
Sitchin’s work will make us dream impossible dreams that we
have not dreamed before. With that, he will bring us to new
progress that we cannot even dream of, if we understand our past
and then foresee our future. It is a new reality too incredible to ac-
cept, too awesome to face. The establishment of a new paradigm
need not cause the fall of the old paradigm. The time has come to
shift into a higher gear and reveal what the future holds for us by
examining our very own past.
God’s Particles are around for billions of years but we only
know they exist in Jul 2012!
Over the years, startling evidence has been uncovered, challeng-
ing established notions of the origins of life on Earth—evidence that
suggests the existence of an advanced group of extraterrestrials who
once inhabited our world.
Many researchers have since uncovered incredible findings hav-
ing depth, complexity, and far-reaching effects in support of Sitchin.
This book is an attempt to bring about the general awareness in the
public of a topic so important and so controversial. The reader is en-
couraged to dig deeper into all the material, the artifacts, the “what
if,” and reach his or her own conclusions.
We need to be aware of our own tunnel vision imposed by the
current scientific and religious orthodoxy. “Your time is limited, so
don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by
dogma—which is living with the results of other people’s thinking.
Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner
voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart
and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to
become. Everything else is secondary.” (Stanford commencement
speech, June 2005, Steve Jobs).
Wake up! This is not science fiction. Truths that were yet un-
known to this day have been unveiled.
