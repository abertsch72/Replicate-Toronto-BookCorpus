EXT.WASHINGTON D.C. AERIAL DAY

INT. WHITE HOUSE-OVAL OFFICE 8:00 A.M. DAY

(A group of top advisors await authorization from the President. Advisors look at each other anxiously awaiting the word to be given. The President sits with his chair facing the window. It is September tenth 2001. Don Romstien (57) Secretary of Defense, Kate Allain (45) National Security Advisor, Thomas Smith (48) Joint Chief of Staff, Ken Pratt (51) Under Secretary of Staff. President George Bath (59))

PRESIDENT
(Slowly, with a break in his voice)
Proceed, by my authorization.

(The advisors rush out of the room.)

CUT TO:

INT. CFR CONFERENCE ROOM APRIL 28 DAY

(In a large dark wood paneled conference room reminiscent of an x-files episode a gathering of administration top advisors meet with members of the council on foreign relations, the shadow government of the United States. Empowered my President Roosevelt in 1941, the Council had dictated the direction of the nation's foreign and domestic policies. As Robert Ash (28) young brash neo-con and a council member directly out of Harvard begins his presentation.)
Robert Ash

First of all I would like to take this moment to thank you for attending today's meeting. We are going to touch upon the current status of our military industrial complex. 

(As a projector comes on, on screen)

Robert Ash
Currently our military budget is two hundred seventy five billion dollars, in order to maintain a modern military that can meet all operational objectives while providing our allies around the world with the arms that they need we must increase the military budget. How do we do this you may be asking yourself by creating an environment in which the American people will push if not beg to increase military spending?

(On the screen a chart of government expenditures.)

Robert Ash
As you can see although the Department of Defense has the largest budget we can still reducing spending in government services such as education, Medicare, Medicaid, after school programs, we have also put in place a plan to pull retirement funds from federal employees. Bottom line we need to take the Department of Defense budget up to five hundred billion dollars within the next two years. We just lost a multibillion contract for fighter jet to the French all due to the fact that we can't sell what we don't have. Let's face the facts people, the Germany make the best cars in the world. The Swiss make the best watches, and the Japanese make the best electronics, what do we do best? We create war, we export war, we produce the best weapons to wage war. When there is war around the world we sell arms sometimes to both sides, when there is no war we start war. We live so others can die, and that is the fact. Does anyone in this room doubt that? So we need a plan to remake our military.

DON ROMSTINE
By remake what is it that you mean?

Robert Ash
The technology is out there we can produce better weapons, faster communications, be precise in our targeting capability, but we need to raise the level.

RICHARD
I think what Robert is getting at may also be the level of actual involvement that we have in conflict, is that a true statement?

Robert Ash
To a point, we don't necessarily have to be directly involved in conflicts to profit by them, arming is the point that I am trying to emphasize here. By arming our allies they take the causalities, we make a profit on arm sales and further our foreign policies in the region.

KATE
Which region are we talking about?

Robert Ash
That is not really an issue at this time, but it is a good question on of which will be the topic of future meetings.

RICHARD
I think what we need to do like Robert said is come up with a plan that the American people will accept to increase the military budget.  

Robert Ash
Any more questions?

RICHARD
Thanks Robert, it looks like we have some work to do we will meet next week to brain storm a plan that we will propose to the President.
CUT TO: 

INT. VICE PRESIDENTS PRIVATE CONFERENCE ROOM -MAY 1 DAY

(A sterile white walled conference room with an old wooded table that dates back to the Truman era whose seats are as hard and cold as Truman himself. Walking to the head of the table Richard Hanny (56) Vice President, looks around at all the faces in the room and leads the discussion)

RICHARD
How do we remake the military and undo eight years of democratic reductions and cuts.  How can we get the people behind the military so much that they will be willing to give everything they have to support the military.

DON ROMSTINE
If history taught us anything, it taught us that the people will support the any decision the President makes if we are attacked. Take Pearl Harbor, when we were attack the whole nation wanted us to go to war, the military was never mightier. We need a new Pearl Harbor.

RICHARD
A new Pearl Harbor, how do you purpose we create a new Pearl Harbor, Don?  I really don't think that anyone can catch us by surprise like what happen in Pearl Harbor.

DON ROMSTINE
It really wasn't a surprise.

RICHARD
I know I read those new revisions of the attack on Pearl Harbor. I know that there is more evidence that Roosevelt knew that we were going to be attack and he let it happen, but this isn't 1941.

DON ROMSTINE
That’s what makes it easier.

RICHARD
How does that make it easier?

DON ROMSTINE
We have the technology to create a new Pearl Harbor with more precision more devastating that will leave more of an impact on the American Public. No the world than ever before.

RICHARD
What are you suggesting Don?

DON ROMSTINE
You and I both attended the energy conference and we will have and oil crises in the next ten years, so why don't we kill two birds with one stone?

RICHARD
How Don?

DON ROMSTINE
We have an attack that we will blame on Saddam Husain, which will give us a motive to attack Iraq and of course while we are there we take control of the oil fields. The attack will convince the public that we should increase the military budget. The threat of terrorist on our soil will gives us the reason to increase the budget.

RICHARD
What kind of an attack are you talking about?

DON ROMSTINE
An attack that will hit at the heart of our military and economic might. I suggest an attack on New York and one on the Pentagon.

RICHARD
Your own building?

DON ROMSTINE
We are remodeling the west side of the building so the damage will be minimum.

RICHARD
And in New York?

DON ROMSTINE
The Twin Towers?

RICHARD
Are you Fucken Crazy? They told me that you are a bit off, but you’re out there.

DON ROMSTINE
(Smiling)
We can't destroy the Empire State Building, it’s too historical, the stock exchange is too low to leave an impact. The Twin Towers will leave a lasting impression.

RICHARD
Does anyone have any thoughts on this? Or any other ideas?

KATE
I believe that Don is right we do need a new Pearl Harbor to unite all Americans, and really get behind the President, but my concern is the loss of life.

RICHARD
But do you think that we should attack the towers?

KATE
I can't think of anything else that would have the same impact short of destroying the Capital, and I really don't think that we should do that.

DON ROMSTINE
Richard think about it, the buildings are big they will smoke for a while which will allow every network to get their asses there and point their cameras. When they fall It will be live on television where we can play it over and over again twenty four seven.

RICHARD
Hold on you just said when they fall, what are we talking about here just an attack or actually bringing down the buildings

DON ROMSTINE
I mean pulling them down. 

RICHARD
Okay. Okay I agree the twin towers will make a good target, but to bring down the buildings, can it be done.

DON ROMSTINE
It is just another building it can come down. 

RICHARD
Now explain the pentagon?

DON ROMSTINE
We diverted some funds that the General Accounting Office has been bugging us about all the records are in our accounting office, we would lose the records if we can strike the west section of the build.

RICHARD
How much funds are you talking about?

DON ROMSTINE
(Hesitantly)
Well, two point five trillion.

RICHARD
What the hell!

DON ROMSTINE
Where the hell do you divert two point five trillion dollars?

DON ROMSTINE
We are running black ops in Venezuela and Afghanistan.

RICHARD
Black ops you can buy those countries with that much money. That is not the whole story, is it Don?

(Don stays quite.)

RICHARD
I don't want to know about it at least not right now...

DON ROMSTINE
Well what do you think? We can make it happen, we can remake the military it’s up to you?

RICHARD
You have the resources?

DON ROMSTINE
Yes. And the funds?

RICHARD
Don't even go there, take it out of the two trillion, I want to see the whole plan that you are proposing, and Don. Don’t fuck with me, I want to see everything in detail who what where and contingencies.

DON ROMSTINE
(Sinister smile)
Yes Sir, Richard I feel that you don't trust me.

RICHARD
Should I?

(Don just smiles at Richard, Kate replays the discussion in her head.)

RICHARD
Kate, are you okay?

KATE
Yes Richard.

RICHARD
Let's go we have a press conference in about a half hour. Don when can I expect the plan?

DON ROMSTINE
Let’s say about two weeks. 

CUT TO:

INT. PENTAGON SECRETARY OF DEFENSE CONFERENCE ROOM DAY

(In a windowless poorly lit cold conference room on the east side of the pentagon Thomas Smith (48) Chief of the Joint Chief of Staff, youngest chief of staff appointed some would say due to his relations with the Council on Foreign Relations than anything else, but he did work Naval intelligence, sits to the right of the head of the table. A meeting is called of the D.O.D. discretionary operational team leaders or in other terms familiar to military members in the black ops. These are the ultra-elites of the military the ones that work with the CIA to overturn governments, kidnap opposition leaders, whose motto is "dirty deeds done cheap". Jim Taylor walks in (47), Black ops specialist whose expertise is explosives while other men enjoy fishing or golfing nothing satisfies him more than blowing up things, Ken Molin (49)counterintelligence specialist, aeronautical engineer by education, feels more comfortable in the world of espionage.)

JIM TAYLOR
Hi Thomas, I haven't seen you since the Gulf War.

SMITH
It’s been a while what have you been up to?

JIM TAYLOR
I have been working with the Kuwaitis teaching them how to detect unexploded ordnances.

SMITH
Ken what have you been up to?

KEN
I spent some time in Europe at Ramstein Air Force Base, just working Intel.

JIM TAYLOR
So what do have?

SMITH
Don is coming in a few minutes to brief us.

JIM TAYLOR
The old man himself this can't be good.

SMITH
Yes.

JIM TAYLOR
Okay so this has got to be big.

SMITH
I'll let him explain.
(Don Romstein walks into the conference room.)

DON ROMSTINE
Morning Gentlemen.

SMITH
Morning Don.

JIM TAYLOR
Morning Sir.

KEN
Good morning Sir.

DON ROMSTINE
Gentlemen we have a mission that is coming from the highest level of government. I don't need to tell you that this is above top secret. Do you understand?

(All acknowledge. Don passes a folder to each man.)

DON ROMSTINE
The mission code name is going to be clean sweep. In those envelops you will have some details but let me explain what we are going to have to do before you open these.  The success of project clean sweep depends entirely on controlling the media and being able to execute our objectives timely. All of you have performed very well in the Gulf War, Haiti, Mogadishu, but this mission is different and if you have any apprehension with it I need to know. Open you envelopes.

(Opening a large manila envelope marked "Top Secret" in big bold letters Jim looks through some photos)

JIM TAYLOR
Don is this what I think it is?

DON ROMSTINE
Yes, those are the World Trade Towers in New York.

JIM TAYLOR
What do you want me to do?

(Jim reads the documents.)

JIM TAYLOR
You want me to take them down?

DON ROMSTINE
That is part of the mission.

JIM TAYLOR
But Don, we never took out any of our own buildings, well I won’t say any maybe some churches in the south but nothing like this.

DON ROMSTINE
I know Jim that is the mission. Is there a problem?

JIM TAYLOR
No sir, there is no problem.

KEN
Don where can I get more information about ghost plane?

DON ROMSTINE
I will provide all the information that you will need and the authorizations.

SMITH
Where are we going to get a missile to strike the pentagon?

DON ROMSTINE
We will get a global war hawk missile and either stage it at Andrews or Norfolk.

(The men look at their documents.)

DON ROMSTINE
Our mission is not only to take down some buildings it’s to create a new Pearl Harbor. To create that same type of enthusiasm for war that the country had when the Japanese attacked our troops. Before the attack the country was in isolation and the Roosevelt needed an event to draw us into the war. Just like then we need an event as big as or even bigger than Pearl Harbor.

JIM TAYLOR
Don so why these buildings?

DON ROMSTINE
These are symbols of economic and military might, the public will relate with that.

JIM TAYLOR
How much time do we have?

DON ROMSTINE
(In the envelopes I have a tentative schedule, what we are hoping for is late August or September.)

JIM TAYLOR
So who are we setting up?

DON ROMSTINE
Iraq, but the CIA wants us to also do Afghanistan.

JIM TAYLOR
I'm sure they do, the second largest opium producing region in the world. That will keep them in business for some time.

DON ROMSTINE
They are getting ready to take over the country.

KEN
Don this project ghost plane has been tested?

DON ROMSTINE
Ghost has been tested and certified I don't have much of the details then what you have in front of you but Col. Robinson at Wright Patterson will fill you in on the rest. I'm not sure if you saw the other part of your assignment Ken but there is another job that we will have to do at Wright Patterson and that is recovery and disposal of excess elements.

KEN
Excess elements, let me see here. One 757 airliner and passengers, Don how many passengers are we talking about?

DON ROMSTINE
I would say no more than one hundred.

KEN
A hundred passengers, we are going to need cell phone jamming devices right from the get go and where do you suppose we will dispose these excess elements.

DON ROMSTINE
Wright Patterson has land that we can use. My main concern is and like the code name indicates it must be a clean sweep. There is not to be any evidence of their existence.

KEN
That goes without saying.

DON ROMSTINE
Now Smith will be coordinating the project from here so everything has to be approved by me through him.  Smith will be the point of contact, if you need anything, explosives for you Jim or if there is any problem at Wright Patterson. You have your teams and you know them well but this is a unique mission, make sure that you have their loyalty, if not then you know what to do am not going to say any more on that subject.

CUT TO:

INT. ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE CONFERENCE ROOM MAY 10 DAY

(In a modern military conference room with pictures of fighter jets on the walls designed for pre-fight briefings with a large screen at one end a group of men sit around a large table this is the alpha team, Jim Taylor the team leader walks into the room.)

JIM TAYLOR
Good morning gentlemen, and I use the term loosely.

(General laughter all around)

BOB
Where are we going this time Jim? Some place good like Thailand?

JIM TAYLOR
I thought you haven't recovered from the last time that we went there.

BOB
You know me Jim I'm a glutton for punishment.

BILL
I remember that chick told you that
(In an Asian accent)
I love you to long

(General laughter)

BILL
The only thing that was to long was the needle after words.

BOB
Yeah but it was well worth it. 

JIM TAYLOR
Okay, okay let’s get down to business. First of all we all have been trained in your jobs and understand our duties and responsibilities, and I don't have to tell you that when we are given orders we are to follow them to the letter no matter what we may think about it. A mission is a mission wither it is blowing up a church in Thailand, taking out Noriega in Panama, or destroying an embassy its all the same, and we get paid very well.

(The room is silent as Jim speaks.)

JIM TAYLOR
What I am getting at is that it isn't personal. It’s not about you or me, our friends and family. It’s a job. Does everyone understand that?

(Nodding the men acknowledge.)

JIM TAYLOR
I have a cd here, Bob can you put this in the projector there?

(Bob takes the CD and inserts it into the projector at the center of the table. Jim grabs the remote.)

JIM TAYLOR
I am going to give you a brief history lesson.

(On screen images of Pearl Harbor.)

JIM TAYLOR
One of the greatest events of the twentieth century was the attack on Pearl Harbor. That attack united the nation and gave way for our military industrial complex that we have today. Our mission is to create a new Pearl Harbor. How do we do this you may be thinking?

(Looking around at the blank faces Jim pulls out some sealed envelopes and passes them around.)

JIM TAYLOR
Don't open these yet. How do we create a new Pearl Harbor, Bob?

BOB
We have to stage an attack on our own ground.

JIM TAYLOR
Right, we will have to stage an attack on our own ground and then place the blame on someone or some country. Does anyone have a problem with that?

JOE
Basically we take out Americans.

JIM TAYLOR
Yes. Is there a problem with that?

JOE
No Sir.

JIM TAYLOR
Before we go on those anyone here have a problem with this.

(Saliently the men nod no.)

JIM TAYLOR
Okay, here is our mission.

(On screen the World Trade Towers.)

JIM TAYLOR
They stand over one thousand one hundred and sixty feet made of Steel and concrete. When built in the seventies it was design to withstand the impact of a Boeing 707. It has one hundred and ten floors. Don’t let the size fool you it is no different than any other building it can come down. We destroyed building around the world only this one just happens to be in New York.

BOB
Jim that is going to take a lot of time and explosives.

JIM TAYLOR
We have time and the explosives will be provided by our friends in the Army. Gentlemen open your envelopes, inside you will find a detailed blue print of the building. It shows what a typical floor looks like, the only difference is in tower one where the communication antenna is. We plugged in the numbers and calculated the amount of explosives that we will need and where on the building we will have to place them.

BOB
Are we going to have to place explosive on every floor?

JIM TAYLOR
Not on every floor, gravity will save up time I believe, it’s about every fourth floor.

(Looking through his documents)

BOB
Jim we just can't go into a building and set up explosives, this isn't some church in Thailand.

JIM TAYLOR
We are going to have all the clearances that we need, the management at the towers have been notified that a group of building inspectors will be coming in, that team will be us.

BILL
Jim couldn't they just call the city to confirm that building inspectors are coming in?

JIM TAYLOR
This is a little bit more than you need to know but. They know what we are there for.

BILL
They know that we are going to plant explosives.

JIM TAYLOR
Let’s just say that this comes from the highest levels of power and leave it at that. 

JIM TAYLOR
Is everyone on task? We start Monday, you have airline tickets and the location where we will meet. Gentlemen let’s get the job done.

CUT TO:

INT. PENTAGON SECRETARY OF DEFENSE CONFERENCE ROOM DAY

(A group of man in black suits white shirt and black tie MIB looking gather around a conference table, we been here before it is the conference room of the Secretary of Defense Don. Smith called a meeting for his team this is the Bravo team. Jack Horner (49) a fifteen year intelligence officer for the Air Force, computer whiz but enjoys Psyops.)

SMITH
Good morning.

JACK
Morning Thomas.

SMITH
Let’s get started. Yesterday we were given an assignment that requires the highest level of security. We will be working with FBI and Air Force out of Andrews.

(Passing out sealed envelopes.)

SMITH
This is what we got, the code name for our assignment will be clean sweep. It is a joint assignment like I say we will be working with FBI and Air Force but also the FAA and in some part local resources.

(As the team looks at the photo of the pentagon.)

SMITH
Clean Sweep is basically creating the new Pearl Harbor. We all know what happen in Pearl Harbor, the Japanese surprise attack forced the United States into World War Two. Only this time there is no Japanese or anyone else.

(The room is eerily silent )

SMITH
In order to create a new Pearl Harbor we need an attack on our own ground an attack that will unite the nation and support our president and of course our military industrial complex. Three targets have been identified two in New York and one here in Washington.

(Placing a diagram of the pentagon on the wall.)

SMITH
What we have is the pentagon, a five sided wedge, wedge five is currently being remodeled that is the side that we will aim at. We will be provided a global war hawk missile from Andrews Air Force Base that we will use to strike the target.

JACK
Thomas what is a global war hawk missile?

SMITH
The global war hawk missile, is a long range recognizance aerial vehicle. It looks like a small commuter air craft, about the size of a twenty passenger craft. The one that we will be using is a modified version that will carry a war head the will explode on impact.

KEVIN
How big a war head?

SMITH
It’s not going to be that big, all we need is to make a hole in the building and set a fire. By our calculation it missile should go through the first two layers and no further.

JACK
So everything else should be okay.

SMITH
The real problem that we are going to have is to tighten down the area after the strike, and that's when the FBI comes in. The FBI will be tasked to provide perimeter surveillance and confiscate videos and cameras that may pick up the war hawk as it hits the pentagon.

JACK
So if they are going to provide perimeter surveillance what are we going to be doing?

SMITH
We are going to identify buildings which have their own cameras, and provide the Air Force with the flight path for the war hawk. We will also be in charge of the creating the media campaign after clean sweep. Besides coordinating the strike on this building we will be the command center for clean sweep operations.

JACK
So we already have our fall guy?

SMITH
We are waiting for confirmation, but we will have it before next week. That’s all I have for now, does anyone one have any questions.

KEVIN
As part of the media campaign will I be at CNN.

SMITH
More than likely, I think they have Fox covered. We start Monday, we will meet here.

CUT TO:

INT. VICE PRESIDENT'S CONFERENCE ROOM DAY

(A dark conference room with a large table in the center, and a screen at one end. Kate (45) National Security Advisor prepares a presentation. Kate an Afro American women wife and mother of two more comfortable in a classroom teaching political science then coordinating national security chosen for her position for public relations value. Don and Smith enter the room.)

KATE
Good morning Don, Thomas.

DON ROMSTINE
Morning Kate.

SMITH
Good morning Kate.

DON ROMSTINE
Is Richard on his way?

KATE
He had to go to the White House he should be back in a few minutes. Can I get you anything?

DON ROMSTINE
Coffee would be fine.

KATE
How about you Thomas?

SMITH
A coffee would be fine.

(Pressing a button on the speaker phone.)

KATE
Sue, can you get some coffee in here.

SUE
Yes, Ma’am.

DON ROMSTINE
What do we have there Kate?

KATE
I have a short presentation on our media campaign.

(The vice president enters the room accompanied by Walter Frisk (56) FBI director, a twenty year veteran of the FBI responsible for cointelpro operations against environmentalist in the redwood region of the Pacific northwest, who coordinated the bombing of a NAACP office in San Francisco in 1996, ruthless, cold hearted just the type of person that you need for a job of this magnitude.)

RICHARD
Good morning, sorry you had to wait.

(Staff member brings in some coffee and cups.)

RICHARD
Good I could use some.

As they get their coffee and return to their seat Richard pulls out some folders.

RICHARD
Thomas can you pass these to everyone.

SMITH
Yes Sir.

RICHARD
Kate are you ready for your presentation?

KATE
Yes sir

(Turning on the projector Kate shuts off the lights.)

KATE
In order for operation Clean Sweep to be successful an effective media campaign must be carefully coordinated. Today we have monitors in all major network, CNN, FOX, ABC, NBC, CBS and so on in the hand out that you have, you have names and contact numbers for each.  Key words and terms that we will have to use in our dialog with the media are but are not limited to, of course Pearl Harbor we must try to always reference the attack on Pearl Harbor in our communications with the media. Weapon of Mass Destruction, this term we can use to describe the use of air planes to strike the towers and pentagon and later we will use on our war campaign.  Terrorism, terrorist, martyrs, Islamic radicals, extremist, chemical weapons, a mushroom cloud, a smoking gun, coalition of the welling, you have a list there of others. We decided to our target the war on terror on a group of Islamic radicals know as Al Qaeda. Walter can you elaborate on this group.

WALTER
Like Kate said Al Qaeda is a group of Islamic radial that is responsible for some terrorist attack throughout the world, but they are not very well organized. Their leader is a man by the name of Osadam Bin laden. Bin Laden was on the payroll of the CIA in Afghanistan for a while when they were fighting the Russians. He is a Saudi so there are some issues that we will have to address.

DON ROMSTINE
Is he related to Salom Bin Laden and the royal family?

WALTER
Yes, you know about him Don?

DON ROMSTINE
I know his family.

WALTER
Then you know how important this is to the President.

DON ROMSTINE
I know, go on.

WALTER
Currently we have a group of FBI agents posing as Muslims going around the country taking flying lessons to substantiate our cover story.

(Pulling out a large envelop, passing it to Smith).

WALTER
Before I forget here are the FBI badges that you be needing for your men.

SMITH
Good deal. 

KATE
The last thing that I have. In your hand outs you have pictures of 19 Muslims that we will use as our hijackers.

SMITH
Kate do you have these digital.

KATE
I can get the digital images for you. Your team is being tasked to create the airport images is that correct?

SMITH
Yes, we will be working on them.

KATE
I will provide you the images before you leave today. That is all I have.

RICHARD
That is all Kate?

KATE
Yes Richard unless anyone has any questions.

(All gesture no )

RICHARD
Well done. Don have you come up with a time table?

DON ROMSTINE
Its tentative, right now we are looking at either the end of August or early September. Configuring the aircraft is what is going to take some time.

RICHARD
But it is safe to say that September is the latest.

DON ROMSTINE
Yes.

RICHARD
To elaborate a little more on the subject of the Bin Laden’s, the royal family agreed to allow us to blame everything on him, I think he is sick and is dying any way.  We have to down play or just hide the ties the President has to the royal family.

DON ROMSTINE
Our contacts in the media should be able to control that.

RICHARD
They should but don't get involved in any conversation regarding the ties. Does anyone have any questions?

(All gesture no)

RICHARD
Okay folks that all we have for right now. Don can I talk to you alone for a few minutes?

DON ROMSTINE
Yes Richard.

SMITH
Don I will be in Kate’s Office picking up those images.

DON ROMSTINE
I will meet you there.

(The conference room closes, Richard and Don remain.)

RICHARD
Don what do you think of Kate?

DON ROMSTINE
What do you mean?

RICHARD
Can she be trusted?

DON ROMSTINE
I know that she is new to the administration, and a close friend of the President but do I know one hundred percent that she can be trusted, I don't know. Can you ever really trust anyone?

RICHARD
Hell I don't trust you as far as I can throw you, but I know that you will get the job done, I just don't want any slip ups.

DON ROMSTINE
Why don't you get Walter to tap her lines?

RICHARD
Far ahead of you, I have taps on her office phone, and home phones.

DON ROMSTINE
Does she suspect?

RICHARD
I don't think so. How about on your end?

DON ROMSTINE
These are the same guys that we used in the Gulf War, they can be trusted.

DON ROMSTINE
Richard if you want me to eliminate her we can always put her in the pentagon during the attack.
RICHARD
Let’s hope it doesn't come to that Don, but there is a lot riding on this.

CUT TO:

EXT. PENTAGON -JUNE 1, 2001 DAY

(A bright beautiful day in Washington D.C., a car parks on the side of the road facing the pentagon, three men step out. One places a lap top on the hood of the car while the other two look at angles and compare notes. On the computer we can see a GPS program giving exact coordinates of their location. Secret Service pulls up.)

SECRET SERVICE OFFICER 1
Gentlemen I'm going to have to ask you for some identification.

(Pulling out his wallet, Thomas tries out his new phony badge that Walter gave him.)

SECRET SERVICE OFFICER 1
Agent Thomas Smith, FBI is there anything that we can help you with?

SMITH
No not really.

SECRET SERVICE OFFICER 1
I am sure that you have your duties and we have ours and we can't have a car parked here, so I am going to have to ask you and your troops to move on.

(Looking at the agent with the lap top.)

SMITH
Are we finished here.

AGENT 2
Yes sir we have all we need.

SMITH
Sorry for the trouble.

(The agents leave.)
CUT TO:

EXT. NEW YORK, NEW YORK- AREAL DAY

(The Twin Towers shimmer in the bright sun light.)

INT. WORLD TRADE TOWER ONE DAY

(Crowds of people enter the build carrying brief cases some with cameras on the way to the observation deck, four men dressed working suites with tool belts and tool boxes enter tower one on the World Trade Center and approach security, the Alpha team.)

SECURITY OFFICER
Good morning how may I help you?

(Pulling out a work order.)

JIM TAYLOR
Hi I am Jim Taylor building inspector, I believe that our office called last week to let you know that we would be here.

(Looking through files on his desk.)

SECURITY OFFICER
Yes I remember, I have it right here and I already have your badges and all the keys that you will need.

JIM TAYLOR
Good deal, that is Bob, Joe and Bill.

SECURITY OFFICER
Nice to meet you guys, just remember that you will have to keep the badges on at all time while in the building.

JIM TAYLOR
No problem, thanks allot.

SECURITY OFFICER
Jim, those badges will allow you to access the building from the lower level maintenance entrance. That way you’re not fighting the crowd.

JIM TAYLOR
That sound very good, thanks allot. 

(Proceeding to walk to the service elevators the men take their equipment. As the evaluator ascends to the top floor the men quietly look at each other, the doors open. Down a long hallway they open a door Leading to the building interior structure. Without a word the men proceed with their mission opening their tool boxes removing a phony section with basic tool revealing C4 explosives with electronic detonation triggers. The men begin to strategically place the devices in the support beams where they cannot be seen.)

EXT. WRIGHT PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE DAY

(The infamous Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, well known to UFOlogist as one of the main locations where artifacts recovered from Roswell were taken. The base is the home for the Air Forces research and development department and has some of the largest hangers outside of area 51. Security at the base is tight it has to be. The commander in charge of research and development is Lt. Col. Robinson (45) a veteran of twenty five years active duty with the Air Force, mostly as a fighter pilot some in intelligence. Robinson greets a group of VIPs from the Department of Defense in his conference room.)

COL. ROBINSON
Good morning I am Lt. Col.  Robinson on behalf of my staff I would like to welcome you to Wright Patterson Air Force base. How did you enjoy your trip here?

(They all gesture a good flight, the team leader of the group Ken Molin )

KEN
We had a good flight a little turbulence at the end there but not bad at all.

COL. ROBINSON
The winds here can give you a bumpy ride. Well I was not told much about your mission or the scope to which we will be assisting your folks they told me that you will be filling us in.

KEN
Sir, with all due respect to your staff we need to talk to you alone.

(Realizing a smell of intelligence in the air, Robinson directs his staff.)

COL. ROBINSON
You folks can go back to you daily assignment, and please lock the doors.

(The Col. Staff leave the conference room. Looking through some of his notes Ken finds a file with "Top Secret" in big letters on the cover.)

KEN
We see that project ghost plane was successfully completed and tested on May 26, 2001. Can you tell us a bit about that?

COL. ROBINSON
Well project ghost plane was designed to remotely control an aircraft fully disabling its electronic guiding system.

KEN
So in other word you have full control of the aircraft, what about the cock pit voice recording system?

COL. ROBINSON
The voice recording system is a standalone system and cannot be deactivated with ghost.

KEN
How long would it take to modify a typical airlines aircraft with the ghost system?

COL. ROBINSON
I would say about a month.

KEN
Once modified would the pilots notice the change?

COL. ROBINSON
If the pilot steps outside he would notice the modification.

KEN
How so?

COL. ROBINSON
For the system to work we would have to attach a separate guiding system to the plane between the right wing and fuselage.

KEN
Is that the only difference?

COL. ROBINSON
Yes, that would be the only difference. 

KEN
Under the direction of the Department of Defense and the Secretary of the Air Force we are taking charge of project ghost plane effective immediately. All personnel currently working on project ghost plane with less than a top secret security clearance will have to be relocated though the Air Force Personal Center.

COL. ROBINSON
I am going to have written authorization.

(Pulling out a sealed envelope Ken passes it to the Col.)

KEN
Its right here.

INT. PENTAGON SEC. OF DEFENSE CONFERENCE ROOM JULY 7 DAY

Meticulous and cold Don holds a status meeting for project clean sweep. Team leaders await for Don to enter the room. Don enters and heads to the front of the room. 

DON ROMSTINE
Today we need to determine the status of project clean sweep. I need to know the status of your teams and if there is any problems with the directives that were given.

SMITH
Bravo team is on task with the directives of clean sweep, but we will have to get access to the global war hawk for our task.

DON ROMSTINE
Kevin, make it happen. How soon can they get the war hawk?

KEVIN
Getting the war hawk is not going to be the problem, the real problem where can we stage it after it is repainted.

DON ROMSTINE
How about at Andrews?

KEVIN
We can do that but let’s not forget the distance, and how much fuel it will take to target.

SMITH
I 'll calculate the distance and plug the numbers and see what we come up with.

DON ROMSTINE
How about ghost? Where are we with that?

KEN
We are on task we should have the modifications done within a month.

DON ROMSTINE
Jim how is the work at the towers coming along?

JIM TAYLOR
The work is coming along fine, we have half of tower one rigged up and we shouldn't have any problems. I had one question regarding the location of the strike, the plan calls for ghost to strike about half way to maybe three quarters up so do we rig the whole building.

SMITH
If you don't rig the whole building then we run the risk of large sections of the building to come down, we won’t be able to convince anyone that only some part of the building was destroyed.

JIM TAYLOR
I see, my concern was if we are running short of explosive can we leave the last floors.

DON ROMSTINE
If you get press with time and you find that you are running out of material that would be fine but we should be able to get anything that you need.

JIM TAYLOR
That’s fine.

DON ROMSTINE
Kate how is the Al Qaeda package coming along.

KATE
We have most of the information that we will need for the media campaign, we are currently working with the CIA to get command and control data.

DON ROMSTINE
Well that should not be hard for the CIA, heck they know those guys.

KATE
No it shouldn't be a problem.

(A new face to the group Sam Jones (45) twenty three year veteran of Air Force Intelligence, Don introduces.)

DON ROMSTINE
I think some of you know Sam Jones, he work with us in the Gulf.

(Some acknowledge knowing Sam and nod.)

DON ROMSTINE
Sam is going to be in charge of Delta team. The FBI cointelpro experts felt that a forth event would help out and Richard approved it. What Delta team be responsible for is shooting down an aircraft while in flight it would give an appearance that the Air Force is out protecting the nation. Please give Sam any assistance that he needs.

(General gestures yes) 
DON ROMSTINE
Now that we are on task we need to come up with a date for clean sweep. Some date that is significant to those people, or some date that will ring out like December 7th 1941.

SMITH
If we can speed things up we can do it on the fourth of July.

KEN
We won’t be finished before the end of August.

DON ROMSTINE
There is no holiday in August right, what do we have in August, football, baseball.

KEVIN
How about September first.

DON ROMSTINE
No. You got Labor Day weekend after and we can lose a lot of money. The airlines are going to lose a lot of money any way so let's not screw them that bad.

(Looking at the wall Smith see an emergency evacuation plan with emergency numbers 911.)

SMITH
I got it September eleven.

KEN
Why September eleven?

SMITH
Just think about it what do we teach our children to do as soon as they can walk and talk? Dial 9 1 1, that number is imprinted in all of our heads.

KEVIN
That is a psychological trigger, every time you hear 911 you think of danger

DON ROMSTINE
(Smiling)
. Good thinking. That is just great, that is better than Dec.7th. That it is September eleven. We will meet again in four weeks.

Trying to imagine the skyline without the tower he holds up his thumb in front of one of his eye while closing the other, a knock comes from the door. Smith leaves the window and answers the door.)

SMITH
Who is it?

JIM TAYLOR
Just me, Jim.

(Smith opens the door.)

SMITH
Jim thanks for coming right away.

JIM TAYLOR
No problem, what's happening?

SMITH
Are you finished with the towers?

JIM TAYLOR
Yes, we are just wrapping it up now, Bob is gathering all the equipment.

SMITH
I have another one for you.

JIM TAYLOR
No way you know how long it took to do just one of the towers, much less two?

SMITH
Its not that big really

JIM TAYLOR
(Frustrated)
Which one?

SMITH
Tower seven, it’s an old building they decided while we were going to redo the sky line we could just take this one down too. It’s an old CIA building and the Mayor has some offices there and a bunker. They want to build a new building so while we’re at it. 

JIM TAYLOR
Let me see it.

(Showing Jim a picture)

SMITH
You see it’s not that big and it should go down easy. The CIA agents are not going to be in the building when it comes down but Don gave the mayor his word that we would make sure that his people had a chance to get out before we pull it. 

JIM TAYLOR
The guys are going to be pissed. We can start a slow burning fire in the building that would give everyone a chance to get out before we pull it.

(Walking to the window Jim opens the curtains and looks for building seven.)

JIM TAYLOR
There it is. 

SMITH
I owe you guys.

JIM TAYLOR
We are going to need more explosives.

SMITH
I'll coordinate it. 

JIM TAYLOR
You have the blue prints?

(Handing Jim a tube Jim opens it and unrolls the blue print.)

JIM TAYLOR
I am going to get back to you on how much more explosives we are going to need.

RICHARD
I just had to finish that e-mail before I lose my train of thought. 

DON ROMSTINE
You needed to see me?

RICHARD
Yes Don, we have a special directives that I want you to coordinate.

DON ROMSTINE
What is it?

(Richard hands Don a folder)

RICHARD
It an emergency evacuation plan for Saudi nationals and members of the Bin Laden family. In there you have the names of Saudis that the President has authorized to leave the country on or right after September eleven. Don its imperatives that no one knows about this.

DON ROMSTINE
How are you going to keep this a secret, by this it looks like you are going to fly twelve private airplanes and twenty four commercial airliners right after we close U.S. air space?

RICHARD
I agree, but we must keep a lid on it and not have any fingers pointing back at the White House.

DON ROMSTINE
Who else knows about this?

RICHARD
The airlines have the names?

DON ROMSTINE
Then you just blow it right there. All we could hope to do is control the media and hope that this shit doesn't finds its way to the internet.

RICHARD
What if we use military aircraft?

DON ROMSTINE
No way! Too many troops will see, you can pull allot of shit on those stupid troops but that will not go well I guarantee you.

RICHARD
So we have no other choice, but to let them fly out commercial.

DON ROMSTINE
If the President is so worried about them why doesn't he tell them to get out on the tenth or just get out now?

RICHARD
He is not going to tell them that and you know it.

DON ROMSTINE
There isn't much that I can do, the only thing that I can do is make sure that none of my people shoot down any of those planes and that is all.

SMITH
Were a go.

JIM TAYLOR
Were on task.

DON ROMSTINE
Barring any real problems we should be on for September eleven. Now on the eleventh we are going to have to make sure that we button down any lose ends right away. What is your team going to do here Smith?

SMITH
We are going to have FBI around the perimeter of the pentagon to confiscate all videos that may capture the war hawk.

DON ROMSTINE
Now the plan calls for the hawk to fly around Arlington how are you going to secure that area?

SMITH
We are going to create a perimeter of unmarked cars to confiscate any camera and if anyone says anything we will just tell them it was for national security.

DON ROMSTINE
And the high way? You know that they have a live feed that plays on that one channel, what is it?

SMITH
I believe its twenty two, we will have to shut off the camera we know that the Sheridan Hotel has a camera that points towards the pentagon that we will have to get immediately after the war hawk strikes.

DON ROMSTINE
That's all we need is some eager beaver rent a cop seeing anything on a surveillance tape.

SMITH
I assure you we'll have all the videos.

DON ROMSTINE
How about the camera at the parking lot entrance? There is one there in that box right?

SMITH
Yes, there is one there we are working on doctoring it up to present to the media after the strike. We need to show something, it would like to suspicious if there is no video evidence that an aircraft it the pentagon.

DON ROMSTINE
Before you release anything we have to look at it. Jim what about the towers? I can't express enough that we can't have anyone hurt in building seven, I made a promise to the mayor that no one will get hurt.

JIM TAYLOR
Tower one and two have enough C4 to go up twice they are programmed to pop all the way down. In building seven we are going to start a slow burning fire that will allow everyone to get out before we pull it. My only concern is in towers one and two the C4 will leave residue indicating that it was demolition.

DON ROMSTINE
We will secure the area and no one will be allowed on the ground to pick up anything.

JIM TAYLOR
How about the steel?

DON ROMSTINE
We have made arrangements to ship the steel out. We are going to have barges to ship out the steel, in fact they are in place as we speak. We just have to make sure that no one takes any pieces out of there.

JIM TAYLOR
The cement will be pulverized anyone that knows anything about demolition will notice. 

DON ROMSTINE
That is why we must maintain control of the media, if anyone asks don't answer any questions about it. Our friends at the network our going to censor anything reported don't worry about that.

JIM TAYLOR
Getting back to building seven we are going to have to come up with a good reason that it fell despite the fact that nothing hit it.

DON ROMSTINE
Shock, the shock of the other structures was the reason that it went down. As long as we control the media no one will be able to say anything.

JIM TAYLOR
Okay, Don.

DON ROMSTINE
How about plane?

KEN
Ghost is on task. We will switch off the two airliners the night before prior to the pilots arrival, we have two pilots that are on payroll that will tell the oncoming pilots that they completed the walk around to keep them from going outside.

DON ROMSTINE
Good, very good, and the two airliners are going to Wright Patterson?

KEN
We are flying them to Wright Patterson later we can return them back to the airlines.

DON ROMSTINE
Is that where we are going to take flight 77?

KEN
Yes Sir.

DON ROMSTINE
And we are clear on what we have to do with the passengers correct?

KEN
Yes Sir, arrangement have been made.

DON ROMSTINE
There cannot be so much as a cell phone, watch, any jewelry nothing.

KEN
We understand all personal belongings will be disposed of and all cell phone transmissions will be jammed as soon as the airliner is within Ohio air space.

DON ROMSTINE
That is fine but what I am saying is that there cannot be any trace. We can't say that the plane hit the Pentagon and then later some personal stuff shows up at an Ohio pawn shop. You have to maintain strict control.

KEN
We have it Sir.

DON ROMSTINE
Now flight 93 are we on task.

SAM
We will have an F-16 flying out of Otis A.F.B. that will make contact with the airliners and fire off a sidewinder missile this will bring it down but the concern that I have is that it will leave a large debris field. We will have people preposition to retrieve any articles that will fill out of the airliner.

DON ROMSTINE
How big will the debris field be?

SAM
By our estimates it looks about eight miles.

DON ROMSTINE
Eight miles, are you crazy? How do you expect to secure a field of eight miles?

SAM
Some of it is over water but a lot is over farm land, if we take care of the farmland first we can always go back and secure the water and wet land areas, but we will need at least one hundred men on the ground.

DON ROMSTINE
No that is too many, you will lose your span of control. You don't think that someone is going to notice a large FBI presence?

SAM
The only way to narrow the debris field is to have the airliner closer to the ground.

DON ROMSTINE
That's no good some knuckle head is going to see the F-16 and the damn story that we are going to push now is that the passengers fought the terrorist and brought down the plane. The State Department thinks that it would make a good story, they will call the passengers heroes. 

SAM
I understand that but something has got to give either we lower the liner or we are going to have to secure at least eight miles of field.

DON ROMSTINE
I am not going to debate this, you have forty men and that is all you are going to get, spread them out you do what you have to do but nothing will get past, are we clear?

SAM
Yes Sir.

DON ROMSTINE
Has the FAA been notified that we will be conducting an exercise on the eleventh?

SMITH
Yes FAA and NORAD also are aware that we will be conducting and exercises. We will send another message twenty four hours prior to confirm. Sir we will also have to direct Andrews to stand down.

DON ROMSTINE
How many people are we talking about?

SMITH
Wing commander, Squadron commander and of course the pilots in the alert hanger about twelve people in all.

DON ROMSTINE
What if we don't?

SMITH
Then we run the risk that an F-16 from the Alert Barn will intercept the ghost or the war hawk before hitting their targets.

DON ROMSTINE
Can they actual intercept them.

SMITH
Sir these pilots are good they will intercept any target.

DON ROMSTINE
Give them the order to stand down.

SMITH
Yes sir.

AIRMAN TWO
We lost guidance for the war hawk.

SMITH
Is it software or hard ware?

AIRMAN TWO
We are going through the checklist, it may take at least four hours before we can tell. 

SMITH
Forget the checklist and just reload the software that might buy us some time.

AIRMAN TWO
The problem with that is that this is an older version and if it has not been updated it could corrupt the whole system, we could lose everything.

SMITH
I see, do the checklist, how long would it take to replace the hardware if we had to?

AIRMAN TWO
That is at least a good eight maybe ten hours. Then of course operational check and programming.

AIRMEN ONE
The current path has it going all over the place it may jar something, but if we find a more direct path.

(Walking to a map of Washington DC)

AIRMEN ONE
See here if we send it along this path we could save time and it might keep it from losing guidance.

AIRMEN ONE
We can always ask.

JOHN

KATE
I call Larry in San Francisco and told him not to get on an airplane on September eleven. He asked me why I didn't say anything else. These people are evil, just evil they couldn't care less.

JOHN
What are you going to do?

INT. CLEAN SWEEP COMMAND CENTER-FIVE THIRTY DAY

(Status board ghost one and two in place, war hawk a go, Otis Air Base F-16 a go, Wright Patterson Air Force Base recovery on task. American Airlines Flight 77 a go. Smith sits at a console anxiously overlooking the command center floor. Don approaches him with two cups of coffee.)

DON ROMSTINE
I told you, you should have gotten some sleep.

SMITH
There is just too much going on.

DON ROMSTINE
This is the same as when we started the gulf war in 1991. Now that took coordination.

SMITH
I heard that it was a black ops but I never got the details. Why did we do the Gulf?

DON ROMSTINE
You have to remember what was going on at the time with the fall of the Soviet Union there were congressmen looking for a peace dividend. They felt that without the threat from the Soviet Union they could take the $275 billion dollar defense budget and fund other government programs.)

SMITH
What programs?

DON ROMSTINE
They wanted to shore up social security, Medicaid, provide health care to all Americans and there was even a provision in there that would provide all high school seniors four years of college at a state college or university. That would have left the Department of Defense with only $125 billion dollars a year, we couldn't have that.

SMITH
So they had a bill to do all this?

DON ROMSTINE
Yes it was drawn up and for the first time ever you had republican and those damn Democrats agreeing on a bill. When they took a head count on who would vote on it we found that just about everyone, we would have lost billions.

SMITH
So what happen to the bill?

DON ROMSTINE
We had to come up with a plan to get rid of the bill. The only way that we could stop it was if we were at war. You may be too young to remember when Iraq and Iran were at war for eight years we supported Saddam, we sold him arms the battle was at a stalemate, but while Saddam was moving all his troops to fight Iran Kuwait was moving the border and stole over sixteen oil fields. We really didn't care because Kuwait was give us oil cheap.

SMITH
So we know that Kuwait stole the field.

DON ROMSTINE
We sure did. So in March 1991 when we knew that we were going to lose our budge we had to formulate a plan. The plan was to get Saddam to attack Kuwait. We had our equipment in place in Turkey and Saudi Arabia in May of 91, the troops were issued desert fatigues. Saddam didn't invade Kuwait until August 1.

SMITH
Didn't the troops ask why they painted the equipment in desert colors?

DON ROMSTINE
Some asked but of course we didn't tell them. The real problem was if Saddam was going to take the bait or not.  We sent this little girl from the state department to tell Saddam that we didn't have any policy on Arab, Arab conflict that we feel he should take back the oil fields that Kuwait stole during the Iraq-Iran war. Convinced that we were on his side the next morning he took back his own field which kicked off the war.

DON ROMSTINE
The day before the British Prime Minister was here at the White House with the President and the Secretary of State Barker was in Russia with Gorbachev, they all had carefully prepared scripts that they were going to read to the media. It read like this act of aggression will not stand on and on.

SMITH
So everyone was in on it the Brits, Russians.

DON ROMSTINE
The Russians at first did not believe that Saddam was going to attack Kuwait. Barker had to convince Gorbachev that before the night was over that Saddam will attack Kuwait and that he needed to be on our side, don't forget we were pumping money into Russia at that time.  

SMITH
So you had all the equipment in place, did you have troops inside Iraq? 

DON ROMSTINE
We had troops inside Iraq to stage an invasion if he didn't take the bait, regardless the war was going to take place.

SMITH
Didn't Saddam say anything about us telling him to take back his oil fields?

DON ROMSTINE
That was the funny part about it, after realizing that now he was being made a fall guy he ordered his troops to go find the girl. They smash through her apartment door and all they found is a dumb dog that she left behind.

SMITH
So she took off.

DON ROMSTINE
She was told as soon as she tells Saddam to take back the oil field that she was going directly to the airport and catching the very next flight to Heathrow. Next morning you see Saddam on CNN telling everyone about the girl but no one believed him.

SMITH
What happen to the girl?

DON ROMSTINE
The Muslims put such a huge price on her head that we had to give her a new identity. To this day there is a price on her head.

SMITH
Clean Sweep doesn't sound as complicated. 

DON ROMSTINE
Here you don't have the problem of dealing with the CIA and foreign governments you just have to make sure that everyone is on task. 

SMITH
So far it looks good, the main thing is that we have enough camera pointing at the towers to get the best effect. Image in this case is everything.

DON ROMSTINE
It will be enough to start a war.

SMITH
So do we have equipment preposition now?

DON ROMSTINE
We have four thousand troops in Pakistan, with a mechanized force. In Kuwait we have another five thousand with two aircraft carriers on the way to the gulf.

Just as the dust starts to settle a rolling sound can be heard again and World Trade tower one collapses. Running as fast as they can pedestrians and emergency crew find shelter in restaurants and other buildings, firemen regrouping to catch their breath.)

FIREMAN 1
Did you hear that?

FIREMAN 2
I heard it!

FIREMAN 1
That was explosives!

FIREMAN 2
I looked back and I saw that the floors were popping out, it was like someone purposely pulled the building.

FIREMAN 1
That’s exactly what it was, the fuel of the airliner had already burn off, and there is no way how it should have fallen.

FIREMAN 2
Those poor guys in there, shit! Who could have done something like this?

FIREMAN 1
Who stands to gain from this? Who could get that much explosives for both buildings.

FIREMAN 2
The military.

FIREMAN 1
We have to go back.

(Turning around as the dust starts to settle the firemen make their way back to what will be named ground zero.)

INT. BOSTON LOAGN AIRPORT DAY

(The shift supervisor thinks back at the incident with the FAA official regarding United Flight 175.)

SHIFT SUPERVISOR
Cindy, can I see you?

AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER
Yes sir.

SHIFT SUPERVISOR
Have you ever seen that FAA official here before?

AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER
I never seen him before.

SHIFT SUPERVISOR
Why did he want that plane on that spot so badly, I wonder if he had anything to do with what happen to it. I'm going to call the FBI.

(As the shift supervisor goes into his office he picks up the telephone and finds the telephone number of the FBI and dials the number. The phone rings.)

FBI OPERATOR
This is the FBI can I help you?

SHIFT SUPERVISOR
Yes, I am a shift supervisor here at Logan International Airport and I want to report a suspicious incident that happen this morning that pertains to United Flight 175.

FBI OPERATOR
I will direct you call please hold on.

(The operator directs the call at an agent but we can see it is one of the clean sweep agents, the call was intercepted.)

EXT. PENTAGON, LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT DAY

(DC Fire Rescue 61 firemen arrive at the Pentagon in response to a call about an aircraft that struck the building. Looking around they see that the grass is untouched and cleanly manicured. A hole in the side of the building about sixteen feet diameter can be seen.)

FIREMAN DC 1
Where is the airplane?

FIREMAN DC 2
I don't see an airplane.

(Pulling their equipment out and setting up hoses the firemen spray water on the building. Venturing into the building the firemen walk the hall ways and look for any evidence of an airplane.)

FIREMAN DC 1
Are you sure that they said it was an airplane?

FIREMAN DC 2
That’s what came through dispatch.

(Unable to find any evidence of an aircraft.)
FIREMAN DC 1
Someone is covering up something. I’ve seen plane crashes, I've worked plane crashes this wasn't an airplane.

FIREMAN DC 2
What do you think it was?

FIREMAN DC 1
You see that hole that was a missile, probably a cruise missile. If it was a plane the grass would have been on fire, we could smell JP4 or some type of jet fuel.

FIREMAN DC 2
So why are they saying it was a plane?

FIREMAN DC 1
Your guess is as good as mine.

(As the men search for anything indicating that it was an airplane they find nothing.)

FIREMAN DC 1
You see no seats, wings, tail section, not even a bag of peanuts.

(A yellow Air Force Fire Truck from Andrews Air Force Base approach the building a Captain climbs out and approaches the local fire department truck.)

AF FIRE CAPTAIN
We need you and your troops to pick up your equipment and fall back.

FIREMAN DC 1
We can help, all of our equipment is already in place.

AF FIRE CAPTAIN
You will have to fall back now, and you and your troops are not to talk to anyone about what you saw here, understand?

FIREMAN DC 1
What we saw here or didn't see here?

(On his radio)

FIREMAN DC 1
Fire Rescue 61 we are falling back all copy? We are falling back, Air Force Fire Department will handle this.

(Voices on the radio acknowledge, the order to fall back. As the local firemen gather their equipment. The men from D.C. Fire Rescue gather their gear and roll up their hoses. The men seen to much the story about an aircraft hitting the building was a lie.)

FIREMAN DC 1
They don't want us here you noticed that?

FIREMAN DC 2
I noticed, they are covering up something big. I think that you are right it had to be a missile an airliners couldn't leave a nice round hole like that.

FIREMAN DC 1
Think about it the shuttle came down from space and there was still body parts and pieces of the space craft. If this was an airplane just couldn't have disappeared, this is BULL SHIT!

FIREMAN DC 2
Let's get out of here.

(As Fire Rescue pulls away from the building they stay and watch as the Air Force Firemen work the fire.)

Digging through the rubble a fireman locates a block box.)

FIREMAN NY 1
Chief I found something!

CHIEF NY 1
What did you find?

FIREMAN NY 1
It looks like the black box from the airplane.

(Other firemen gather)

CHIEF NY 1
That's exactly what that is a black box.

(Approaching the group of firemen the FBI agents flash their badges.)

FBI 4

REPORTER 1
Sir can you tell us what you saw?

WITNESS 1
I was standing not more than three hundred yards from the Pentagon when I saw this small airplane flying about fifteen feet off the ground just slam into the side of the building.

REPORTER 1
You say it was a small airplane?

WITNESS 1
Yes it couldn't have been no more than a twenty sit airplane, it was small.

REPORTER 1
What did it look like?

WITNESS 1
It looked like a commercial airplane but what I found strange was that the windows were black. I mean it really didn't look like windows.

REPORTER 1
So what you are say is that it wasn't a big commercial airliner.

WITNESS 1
Hell no it was small and it made a high pitch sound just before it hit the building.

TECHNICIAN ONE
Yes you could see right through the airplane's windows. I will never forget the looks on their faces as the plane hit the building.

(The camera man pans to the smoking Pentagon and sees no signs of an aircraft. Another technician approaches the reporter.)

TV CAMERA MAN

TV CAMERA MAN
If this hit the Pentagon and caught fire why isn't there any burn marks on it.

FE
That’s true.

TV CAMERA MAN

FE
Yes?

How can I be alright we just killed thousands of people today.

RICHARD
I know that right now you don't see the reason, but in time you will understand why we had to do this. Don't forget you are a part of this, you always have been. You don't think that you just spy on nations, you gather information so that we can make decisions on the course of action.

KATE
Our intelligence gathering did not call for the killing of thousands of innocent Americans.

RICHARD
But it did Kate, you find the problems around the world and identify our weaknesses. You show us how vulnerable we are and that we must continue to build up the military.

KATE
But there is no threat, anywhere.

RICHARD
There is Kate. A real threat to this country’s military, and everyone who buys gas for their car. The threat is to our way of life.

KATE
This isn't our way of life.

RICHARD
Kate it is our way of life.

(Tears come down Kate's face.)

RICHARD
From the day that we stepped onto this land and we killed the first Indian in the name of this nation. We moved west and took out the weak and each time this country has gotten stronger. There was twelve million Indians in this country and when we were through there were less than five hundred thousand. Did anybody care? If you ask anyone how many people did we kill in Vietnam do you think that know? We killed three million people in Southeast Asia. We killed over three million more in Iraq during the Gulf War, nobody gives a shit as long as they have cheap gas and can go about their lives. From time to time we have to convince them that there are radicals out there that threaten our way of life. 

(Silent Kate doesn't answer. Looking at the television monitor.)

RICHARD
Those people who gave their lives today will do more for this country than you or I. They will unite the masses, they will help us to create a new world order

KATE
That’s what this is about a new world order?

RICHARD
To bring order to the world we need a strong military, this will do it and when the people forget we will do it again. Roosevelt did it do you think that he lost any sleep over it? 

KATE
So when does this stop?

RICHARD
Stop, this is only the beginning. Now we have to unite the nation and direct our resources to our next objective.

(On the monitor the president makes a statement.)

PRESIDENT

I want to reassure the American people that the full resources of the federal government are working to assist local authorities to save lives and to help the victims of these attacks. Make no mistake, the United States will hunt down and punish those responsible for these cowardly acts.

The president’s words

PRESIDENT
Our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts. The victims were in airplanes or in their offices: secretaries, business men and women, military and federal workers, moms and dads, friends and neighbors. Thousands of lives were suddenly ended by evil, despicable acts of terror. The pictures of airplanes flying into buildings, fires burning, huge structures collapsing have filled us with disbelief, terrible sadness, and a quiet, unyielding anger. These acts of mass murder were intended to frighten our nation into chaos and retreat. But they have failed. Our country is strong. Dedicated to the friends and families of all the innocent men and women who lost their lives on September eleventh two thousand one. When evil is allowed to govern can man truly be free.
