The events taking place in this book began 50 years after the flight of earthlings-aliens from the planet Firmness. The alien's diary falls into the hands of Police Inspector Rickslem Yark. This diary is being hunted by agents of the Department of Inquiry. But Rick decides to keep the diary with him. But on the Firmness, invisibly from people, there is a force that wants to keep information about the aliens secret and get this diary. Three friends - two police officers and a private investigator decide that they can resist the mysterious Dolls. But the Dolls always get what they want. 
This book is a continuation of my book "The Path in the Abyss", but it reads as an independent work.

                                                                Peaceful coast.

                                                                  Chapter first.

                                              Inspector Rick Yark. A Quiet Harbor.


At this time of year, a feeling of lightness and renewal, in spite of everything, repels any weight that managed to build a vile nest under the heart, managed to take root in thoughts and feelings last winter, and now new feelings that already excite the soul in their own way, filling it with freshness and the aromas of spring.
It was like that every spring.
Rickslem Yark, Chief Inspector, Lieutenant of Quiet Harbor Police Station 2, was now standing at the intersection of North Seventeenth and Third Street, waiting for the green permit light to flash at the traffic lights.
His name - Rickslem, he did not like, preferring the abbreviated "Rick".
Once, in the days of his youth, he even thought about changing his name to another, but he did not dare to do so. In the fall, he turned forty-nine, which means that it is too late to change anything in his life. 
Life has already taken place.
And the name, and the way of life, and the way of thinking.
A red light was on at a traffic light attached to a light pole, cars were passing by Rick, an elderly woman in a gray coat stood next to him, holding a black grocery bag in her right hand. The second half of the day passed towards evening, the sun shone brightly on the right between the rows of facades of houses, sloping towards the horizon of Firmness. The sky cleared of clouds, and smooth puddles lay on the asphalt of the sidewalks and roads.
It smelled of spring.
There was no wind and the weather was quite warm, but Rick still put on a light, waterproof raincoat and now he was sweating in his cloak, sweat appeared on his nose. He pushed the black hat to the back of his head, as he always liked to wear it.
He remembered Laina, and grinned contentedly - she always reprimanded him for such an appearance.
"- Rick, so you look like a bum!"
Laina.
His spring.
Great day.
Somewhere from above behind Rick's back, the city train roared, reflecting a rolling echo from the walls of houses washed by recent rain, rolled further along the iron overpass, taking with it the lingering rumble and clatter of wheels.
A green light came on at a traffic light.
Unbuttoning the top button of his cloak, he stepped toward the road.
Once, about fifteen years ago, traffic lights were switched by a traffic policeman, but then they were removed - electrical relays were installed at the traffic lights and there was no need for people to control light signals.
It was a long time ago.
He even remembered the knob - black, cold, hateful.
Everything happened quickly, Rick did not even have time to react, jumped back - a red, two-seater "Bully-7B" flashed in front of him in a half-step, doused him from a puddle of muddy water.
The woman with the bag screamed loudly.
The car, sparkling with brand new paint, quickly moved away from the intersection, leaving behind a faint fog of exhaust gases. Rick managed to notice her number - AE 380. The last - the fourth digit of the number, he did not see.
AE 380.
Red "Bully".
You bastard.
Rick, looking around, moved through the intersection, and crossing to the opposite side of the street, began to shake off the dirt from his cloak, but only smeared it.
On the black skin of his cloak, the sight of dirt was defiant.
The cloak had to be removed and carried, thrown over the right hand.
«Ho Brothers» Restaurant was more than a block away.
He tried to calm down, but there was no trace of the spring mood.
Now, walking down the street without a raincoat, in his new black suit, bought in winter, Rick began to chill.
The sun was shining in his face.
He reached into his jacket pocket for cigarettes and a lighter.
Rick lit a cigarette.
No, you won't be able to calm down.
«Bully» of the new model.
Expensive toy. Its owner will be easy to find, but it won't be possible to squeeze it - it's more expensive for yourself. Although, if you take this matter seriously ...
Rick spat on the sidewalk.
No, it won't work.
Even if you are a police officer.
To distract himself, he began to think about the upcoming business.
Passing the shop windows, Rick Yark glanced at their contents, smoked a cigarette and avoided puddles, trying not to get his black patent leather shoes dirty.
«- Rick, you look like a funeral agent,»- Abrom Chloe told him today.
Looking around at his reflection in the glass windows, Rick was quite pleased with himself - black suit, shoes and hat.
Funeral agent.
You should have seen, Abrom, the funeral agents!
Do they wear such costumes?
Rick looked at his jacket.
No, they don't walk like that.
To be honest, for some reason he did not look closely at the appearance of the funeral home agents - they always smiled and always grieved, and he did not want to recognize himself as their likeness.
A good suit.
Laina liked him that way.
Himself too.
Abrom is a blockhead.
When he reached the corner of the block where Lilac Boulevard began, he turned left and walked along the sidewalk along the road, prudently staying away from the roadway.
Red "Bully".
Oh well.
A holster with a pistol on his left side, concealed by a well-cut jacket, gave a pleasant weight with every step.
There was just a little walk to the restaurant.
Actually, "The Brothers Ho" used to be an ordinary third-rate bar, where all the rabble of nearby neighborhoods gathered, from furniture factory workers to vagabonds and unemployed, and then bore the sonorous name "Rhapsody", although from the music there was only a battered gramophone, with a large brass and crumpled in fights, a pipe, and two waitresses - strong, busty ladies, prone to dirty expressions, and had shrill and disgusting voices. Rick visited Rhapsody a year and a half ago, was saturated with the stench of a diner and was deaf from the roar of the waitress Lolly, who now and then shouted in the direction of the distribution window - "Sterng, another portion of the terrible fire!"
"Terrible fire" - disgusting swill, considered there a signature cocktail, at the mere recollection of which, Rick's stomach twitched in fright.
Across the road, on the rare benches of Sirenevy Boulevard, there was no one - people walked along the asphalt path past bare trees on their evening business. Someone was walking with a dog.
An elderly couple passed by Rick, slowly, quietly talking among themselves. Rick stepped aside, making way for them, threw a long-extinguished cigarette into the urn, and reached into his jacket pocket for a second.
Spring rainbow sun, inexorably rolled towards the sunset.
Still, he did not believe in rebirth.
Not.
One can scatter about the "new quality" or "second wind" as long as one wants, but he could not believe in the qualitatively new "breath" of "Rhapsody".
Such «breath» cannot be refreshed.
Rick was absolutely sure of that.
Although someone from their site was at the «Ho Brothers», and seemed even satisfied.
Hmm.
He walked to the large "Dawn" department store, which had survived an unsuccessful robbery and two fires last year — with a wide, marble porch and a spacious parking lot on the right.
Laina asked him to buy something, remember what exactly Rick could not, and he quickly stopped thinking about it, accepting it as a necessary evil. Behind the "Dawn" stretched a bulky and long bastion of an eight-story apartment building - a respectable one with high staircase steps and expensive, forged bars on the front doors. Passing the porch, Rick saw a gray-haired doorman in a dark, braid, embroidered gold livery behind the glass of the door.
The old footman was bored.
Rick thought about the upcoming evening.
Of course, it is not necessary to count on the fact that he will find Murklay in the “ Ho Brothers", but at least the evening promises to pass peacefully. Again, there is an opportunity to sit in a restaurant, listen to good music and drink a glass of vodka at the expense of the police department.
A rare and pleasant opportunity.
He raised his right hand and looked at the watch on his wrist.
Three more hours before the end of the shift!
Murklay was wanted for carjacking.
An ordinary hijacker who did not disdain burglary either. It is unlikely that this type will stick into a restaurant, even if it is the former "Rhapsody". But the information is worth working out.
Moreover, at the expense of the police department.
Rick smiled warmly.
The Police Department will not become impoverished.
He remembered the façade of the city police chief's house, a real mansion with a mosaic-tiled fountain, and felt annoyed.
Will not become poorer.
In front of the bus stop, a large billboard was already looming, mounted on two concrete pillars, in the form of a stylized heart, in the center of which was depicted a half-naked, laughing girl holding a musical trumpet. The painted girl's breasts protruded forward, and in Rick's eyes, had incredible and monstrous proportions to her body. Maybe the artist had an infinitely long period of abstinence, so necessary for creative throwing and searching for himself?
Although ... As you know, anyone can offend an artist. Probably, the guy who painted the girl, never in his life had the opportunity to look at a woman's breasts.
Rick chuckled, he thought that the artist could well paint his masterpiece from life, having found a muse for creativity in his wild searches.
The neon lights that were now turned off formed the word "Ho Brothers" under the "heart".
The "Ho Brothers", Rick never met.
The restaurant itself was located behind the bus stop.
" Ho Brothers" now occupied the entire first floor of a three-story building of half a century, the windows of the first floor were gone, they were laid and leveled with a layer of new plaster with the entire facade, but the entrance doors are now just huge, high and wide, casting bronze and sparkling with glass. On either side of the door, the restaurant was guarded by two gaping jaws of plaster lions.
Rik's door was opened by a young and robust smiling doorman.
	 - Good evening.
Rick smiled back, and silently walked into the wide lobby, thinking what a feeling his visit to a restaurant evokes from Abrom Chloe, who was sitting somewhere in a nearby cafe. To Rick's left, the entire wall was a mosaic of colored glass and mirrors, to the right, behind a long, red-lacquered wooden counter, was a wardrobe. Two men in unbuttoned jackets were drunk and talking quietly, leaning their elbows on the hat table.
Rick did not linger and immediately went to the entrance to the hall, from where the music was coming. He carried his mud-stained cloak in his left hand.
Entering the hall, he immediately realized that "Rhapsody" had died long ago and hopelessly - everything around here was screaming about money, and no doubt about new people who owned the restaurant.
The spacious hall, immersed in the twilight, where half of the tables were empty, waiting for the evening, smelled of perfume and tobacco smoke, electric lamps in the form of tongues of flame were burning near the stage, and a small orchestra played a quiet melody "Darling without you" - sadly and quite professionally. Rick noticed what the musicians were wearing - men in black, formal suits, a singer, a tall, well-built young brunette, in an expensive cream-colored dress embroidered with sparkling sequins. Her head was decorated with a mother-of-pearl rim, with a large white and fluffy feather.
He glanced at his suit, noted with annoyance that he would quite pass for one of the musicians here.
   Honey, without you
   no rest, agree
   that you are alone now
   come from the darkness of dreams.
   Darling, without you …
Rick walked over to an empty table on the right wall, next to a white pillar, hung his cloak over the curved back of a wooden chair, and sat down with his hands on his knees. On a table covered with a maroon tablecloth, there was a heavy green-glass ashtray, a glass of napkins and a low lamp, dimmed by a colored lampshade.
He looked around casually.
If Murklay was here, it wasn't at the tables closest to Rick. Some visitors sat with their backs to him, and Rick could not understand if there was a wanted person among them.
The waitress was already walking towards him - a short girl, in a uniform, short dress made of blue silk, in a white apron.
The girl was beautiful.
The owners of the restaurant knew how to select their staff.
I wonder, Rick wondered, is there a model here who posed for the artist for the advertisement?
The waitress stopped in front of Rick, a notebook and pencil in her hands.
	 - Good evening. What will you order?
Rick would swear that she smiles at him with the warmest and most cordial smile, as if he were her own brother.
«- Father. You old asshole»,- Rick thought.
His mood immediately turned sour.
	 -  Good evening. It is too early. Bring me, please, some salad and orange juice, - he smiled back at her. - I will while away the evening alone.
The girl left.
He watched her go, noting to himself that her legs were also beautiful.
No, he would not have trailed after her if she had let him.
He is happy with Laina and hopes that she is also happy with him, although sometimes disagreements arise between them, well, who doesn't have them? But looking in the trail of the waitress, he saw his past years.
Hmm.
Gone years.
Like autumn leaves.
Not the most optimistic thoughts.
"- At least boy, you're not falling apart yet."
He looked around again - Murklay was not in the vicinity.
No one entered the hall through the front door, and no one left it.
Rick shook the ashes from the cigarette into a massive ashtray, touched the green glass with his hand, looked into the emerald play of light on its edges.
With such a contraption, you can easily kill a person.
The orchestra played a new melody, this time "Love Cut".
The double bass and drummer set the pace, the saxophone screamed of despair, and the singer sang in a deep, well-set voice that attracted the attention of the audience.
Yes, the owners of this institution have put their business on a grand scale.
A few minutes later, his order was on the table in front of him, but to his surprise, Rick saw in front of him, next to a glass of orange juice and a small plate of salad, a misted bottle of expensive cognac.
	 - Girl, this is a mistake, I did not order cognac - he simply did not have money for this bottle of cognac.
She smiled sweetly, a friendly smile from a waitress:
	 - This is for you from our restaurant. Enjoy your evening, - the girl smiled charmingly and left.
Rick took a tall glass of juice in his hand, took a sip - he was no longer looking at the waitress.
Something hurt him unpleasantly in his chest.
"- Good evening to you."
They recognized him.
Cognac was brought to him.
In a friendly way.
Rick believed that a police officer should catch bandits, and not accept handouts from them. Those who called themselves the «Ho Brothers» invested crazy money in the restaurant, and they hardly earned this money by selling pies at the station. In addition, an honest person does not care who came to him - a policeman, a businessman or a sock trader, and he will not, out of the kindness of his soul, put in front of him a brandy that costs more than Rick earned in his station in a couple of weeks.
He did not touch the cognac.
Rick crushed the butt of a cigarette in the ashtray, thought that with his work he would not quit smoking - he lit the third cigarette.
As time went.
He sat there for another two hours.
The orchestra members left for a break. They sat down at two tables near the stage.
The salad in Rick's plate has already disappeared.
Nice salad. Albeit inexpensive.
It is unlikely that the head of the police department will order such a salad.
Four guys and two girls entered the hall, walking a little further than Rick, they took a table in the second column, cheerful and well-dressed. He looked back to the entrance to the hall and only now noticed the one who was sitting at the extreme table against the back wall, in the very corner.
This was the last thing Rick expected.
Kines Grain.
Rick turned away, took a deep drag on his cigarette, and blew a long stream of smoke into the aisle between the tables.
And this is what is needed here?
Or have private investigators become so good at living that they can afford to sit in an institution like this?
He remembered how, three years ago, he had been ransacking Kines's office in the working-class neighborhood of the city - a wretched, small room, with a sagging chair at a shabby table. He was suspected of hiding evidence in a sensitive case (and divorce cases are always scrupulous, especially if later the cuckold husband is found with his throat cut), but nothing was found and was limited to a fine.
Rick didn't remember why.
So Kines Grain.
Kines the Nimble.
Hmm.
Although. What does it matter to him who sits at the table in the corner? Maybe he got an inheritance? Can a private investigator get an inheritance or not?
Rick was amused by this thought, he laughed softly.
A private investigator inherited an inheritance while investigating a divorce case.
He pictured Kynes slitting someone's throat and almost laughed out loud.
“- I would look at it. I'll have to ask him himself. "
On the one hand, Rick did not like private detectives, among them there were frankly disgusting types and penetration into someone else's housing was not the hardest of theirs - blackmailing clients, theft and even murder. On the other hand, Rick could not remember an act for Nimble, for which he would gladly send him to jail.
But as they say, for the time being, for the time being ...
He could no longer smoke.
Putting the cigarette butt in the overflowing ashtray, he leaned back in his chair and began to look at the resting musicians. The singer, smiling, listened to what the tall drummer spoke quietly to her. Actually, Rick should have taken a partner with him, but Guy had been lying at home with a cold for the third day (in fact, he was in a binge and Rick, as he could, covered him from his superiors), Frou was already overwhelmed with business. Rick rightly judged that running around with door-to-door interviews in the working-class neighborhood, trying to unleash a week-old stabbing case, in houses where there was not always an elevator was the prerogative of young people. In addition, young people should be protected from temptation, and a bottle of cognac offered in an expensive restaurant is a serious test.
For external observation, I had to take Abrom with me, and go to the restaurant alone.
Rick smiled, pleased.
Three men entered the hall.
The first, a tall and thin blond man with narrow cheekbones on a pale face, was dressed in a dark brown suit from under which an impeccable shirt gleamed, and the collar was decorated with a strict, black tie with a hairpin. The second, medium height, with short hair, in a baggy green sweater, light beige trousers and shoes of the same color, was Murklay.
The third, a short, fat man, in a light, checkered suit, trailed after them, fanning his round face with a gray hat.
Rick turned away and took a sip of an almost empty glass of juice.
He didn’t have to go into his jacket pocket for the photograph of the hijacker lying in it to make sure his eyes were correct.
They walked almost to the stage, turned to the right and settled down in the corner at a table.
He glanced sideways at Kynes. He was lazily picking something in his plate.
“- Damn you, he thought of the hijacker.»- The evening is gone.
A partner, even if young and “prone to temptation,” would be very useful now.
There are three of them.
Taking the hijacker in the forehead is a stupid idea. Can call the office to send help - the phone booth Rick saw in the lobby, explain the situation, and wait.
Twenty minutes passed - Murklay and his friends (if they were friends) did not go anywhere. The waitress brought them two bottles, plates of food. The guy in the dark brown suit lit a cigarette.
They looked calm.
Another ten minutes passed, and Rick was finally ready to call the office, when both friends, who were sitting at the table with Murklai, calmly got up and slowly walked to the exit from the hall. They walked past Rick without turning their heads in his direction.
Are gone.
The musicians were already on stage and played a slow and sad melody from the movie "Road to the Sea".
Murklai called the waitress with a gesture, they briefly talked about something and the girl, pointing with her hand, somewhere in the direction of a dark niche, behind a lighted stage, went to another table.
Murklay pushed his chair away from the table and stood up.
He calmly looked around the room, smoothing his hair back with both hands, like the tough guys do in the movies, and went backstage. Letting him hide in the shadow of a niche, Rick got to his feet and headed in the same direction, unbuttoning his jacket as he went, as if he suddenly felt hot.
He decided that the hijacker had gone to the toilet, and there might be no other convenient opportunity for his arrest.
Behind a dark niche hung heavy, black curtains behind which stretched a long corridor, lit by three electric lamps hanging from the ceiling. A door slammed at the end of the corridor. Rick unbuttoned his holster, pulled out a pistol, removed the safety catch and cocked the trigger, ran, literally bumped into the closed door. He needed to hit her twice with his shoulder so that the latch on the other side broke and the door to the toilet swung open.
On the left were closed booths, on the right were urinals, the window opposite the door was wide open. 
Scolding himself for the slowness, Rick rushed to the window, climbed onto the windowsill and, looking around and up, jumped down to the narrow area of the fire escape, stood still listening, looked down, but it was quite high up to the asphalt of the alley, and in the alley itself it was quiet. It took him a few seconds.
It was already dark.
Rick looked up. And at that moment, from somewhere on the level of the third floor, where the same platform hung, fire flashed twice, accompanied by the roar of two shots. One of the bullets clanged against the metal of the ladder very close to him.
Aiming up the stairs, Rick ran along it as quickly as possible, clinging to the handrail with his left hand, a minute later he passed the landing of the second floor, and was already running up to the third.
He did not see the shooter, but he heard the hurrying footsteps from above. Either the bastard was hiding, waiting for the right moment to shoot him point-blank when Rick starts to climb the platform on the third floor, or he is already on the roof trying to escape.
There were no more shots.
He could not have expected such agility from a car thief, especially with shooting at a policeman.
Holding the pistol at eye level, Rick found himself on the third floor landing - the last, long section of the fire escape climbed vertically up along the wall and was lost from view in the dense darkness.
	 -  Damn you.
Rick climbed upstairs.
Now he was a perfect target, one shot from the hijacker could solve everything. Climbing the reinforcement bars from which the ladder was assembled, with a pistol in his right hand, is not an easy task, Rick was afraid that he might drop the pistol every time his hand, busy with the weapon, rested on the step of the ladder.
He reached the edge of the stairs and, aiming at the darkness in front of him, made his way to the roof.
The high gable roof extended far ahead, cutting off on either side with steep, flat sides, and against the background of the towering wall of the nearest house, illuminated by the light of street lamps, Rick saw a retreating dark figure, staggering along a ridge, past the ventilation pipes protruding into the sky.
	 - You son of a bitch.
He stepped on the ridge of the roof - sloping, smooth, tin and, fearing to fall down, ran forward, ridiculously shifting his legs.
The daytime warmth disappeared in the air, a weak, moisture-saturated, cold wind blew on the right. The sky was covered with clouds, but there was no rain - a dry roof lay under feet as a dark mountain.
Rick could not run fast and was clearly lagging behind Murclay. Stopping, he tried to take aim, but from the cold wind his eyes began to water, everything in front of him was floating.
He fired.
The roar of the shot was drowned out in the low sky.
The figure in front continued to recede.
Again he ran forward, constantly looking at his feet, where the movement of his legs and the surface of the roof merged into one dull shadow.
A distant shot slammed. The bullet barely struck his shoulder - burned flesh, tore at the fabric of his jacket, Rick flinched and lost his balance. With a wave of both hands, he fell on the dull ridge of the roof, dropped the pistol and, hitting his chest on the tin, slid down to where the traffic was rustling, and the yellow glow of street lamps diluted the darkness like morning dawn. He threw his hands forward, resting his palms on the smooth surface of the tin roof, raising his head and spreading his legs out in different directions, he slid, lying on his stomach, picking up speed, to where, behind the dark edge of the roof, devoid of any obstacles, the wall glowed dull houses opposite, and the edge of the roof, black and flat, quickly revealed the nearby street below. Moments passed from his injury to falling onto the roof, but they seemed like eternity to Rick's.
Another second and his movement abruptly stopped - the buckle of the belt of his trousers caught on the protruding joint of the tin sheets, his fingers, tearing off the skin, slipped through the bent edges of the metal.
He froze.Rick froze in a motionless position, lying upside down with his legs apart and his arms bent at the elbows. The pistol disappeared over the edge of the roof. The skin ripped off on his fingers was raw. Resting his fingertips on the cold tin and holding his breath, Rick stared at the black edge of the roof, listening to the noise of the cars passing down the street below.
He lay there, afraid to breathe in air, fearing that the slightest movement could rip the belt buckle off the safety hook.
Falling down from this roof, counting from the height of the fourth floor, onto the asphalt of the sidewalk, is not a fun prospect. He thought there should be a rainwater gutter under the roof, and that gutter was his only hope. True, grabbing it, flying upside down, is unlikely to work, given the fact that this chute still needs to be noticed in time.
It was not necessary to count on Abrom's, who was now sitting in the cafe.
How long will it take for Abrom to finally lose his patience and go to check how Rick is doing in the restaurant? Then, after making sure that he is not, Abrom must start looking for Rick, which Rick, in fact, doubted very much. Abrom would rather think that he missed the moment when Rick left the restaurant than climb to look for him on the roof.
Abrom will not climb onto the roof.
Rick was sure of that.
An empty case.
He began to calculate his chances of salvation if he tried to climb to the top of the roof ridge on his own and realized that such an idea, although not without sense, made these chances very meager. Tearing himself off the hook that caught his belt meant for Rick to lose his dubious, but restraining, saving "straw for a drowning man." In addition, he was not sure that his fingers would not slide on the smooth sheet when the weight of his body was transferred to them.
Somewhere to the left, from the side of the fire escape, hurried, soft steps were heard. Footsteps quickly approached, died down and a shot rang out!
Rick almost jerked.
He realized that not one of Murklay's friends was shooting - it was simply impossible to miss from such a close distance at the lying helpless Rick.
He decided that the incredible had happened, and there, on the ridge of the roof, stands Abrom Chloe.
Then a second shot rang out and footsteps rustled very close to him. A second or two later, someone's tenacious fingers literally dug into the ankle of his right leg, and pulled him backward until it hurt.
Rick said quietly, his gaze never leaving the edge of the roof:
	 - Abrom, don't let it out! Bring me, buddy!
	 - Inspector, you would at least help me, - said a familiar voice behind Rick. - I will not pull you out myself.
Rick backed up, resting his hands, the blood under his fingers made his palms slippery. Now he was already grabbed by the hem of his jacket, then Rick's legs climbed over the ridge of the sloping roof and he lay down on his stomach — froze.
	 - Stay here. I am now.
Rick didn’t answer, he tried to catch his breath, the blood beating in his temples with echoing, heavy blows.
	 - Son of a bitch.- Rick gasped, out of breath.- Son of a bitch.
Turning his head to the right, he saw an agile, dark figure retreating along the roof.
Seconds later, distant words reached Rick:
	 - Lie down. I'll shoot you!
Rick began to climb - hard. He was choked with anger and still-unrelenting fear. Rising to his feet, he slowly walked to where Kines Grain stood motionless. To the right of the ridge protruded a square ventilation pipe, on which the private detective leaned his back, on the other side of him, lying on his stomach, holding on to the ridge with his hands, Murklay lay flat.
	 - Just try to jerk,- Kines said.
	 - Let him twitch, bitch.- Rick hobbled over to them and stopped, holding on to Kines's left shoulder.
	 - I give up.
	 - He's giving up, Rick.
	 - When did you and I become on a short leg?
	 - Now.
	 - I injured. Injured!
	 - He's injured,- Kines remarked judiciously.
Rick silently looked at the defeated enemy, listened to his crazy thoughts, one worse than the other.
	 - This is what I think, Kai. I do not need him.
	 - At all?Yeah. And you? Why did you get in here?
	 - I wanted to ask him something.
	 - So ask, otherwise he has a couple of minutes left to live.
	 - I give up! Everything!
	 - Have you heard anything? - asked Rick, Kines's. - Or was it my imagination? I just went through this - I'm still shaking.
	 - My hearing is bad. It seems to me that it is the noise of the cars below.
	 - There below?
	 - Yes, downstairs. Very high. I knew a guy who liked to run around with a gun on the roof. He stumbled and fell.
Rick chuckled into the darkness - he was starting to like this play on words. He said:
	 - Poor fellow. Was his collected?
	 - Yes. With a shovel,- Kaines replied.- And then they washed away for a long time what was left on the asphalt.
	 - I injured. My hands are numb!- Murklay raised his voice, and there were shrill notes in it.
	 - You can't, you can't leave the janitors without work, - Rick shook his head. - They have families, children …
	 - One less bastard. Although, he is unlikely to crash and die.
	 - Why?
	 - From such a height, it happens that they remain alive, - Kynes's voice sounded in the dark, judicious.- But they spend a huge amount of gypsum on them.- Besides, he won't read.
	 - Will he go blind?
	 - Rick, think for yourself, who will hold the book for him and turn the pages? Have you seen the books? You can kill with these books! And the nurses do not like to take on extra work. They still have to clean the duck from under him, wipe his ass …
	 - Shamelessly somehow.
	 - Yes, it’s not honorable. But maybe he is lucky, and he will quickly suffer.
	 - What to do if he broke down and we did not have time to help him.
	 - We? What are you, I was not here at all. When the poor fellow fell on the asphalt, I was far away!
	 - This is where, if not a secret?
	 - My aunt has. She is already old. She needs help.
	 - Get me out! My fingers are numb!
	 - He might even get better. He is a healthy guy and runs well on roofs.
	 - This is the case, there is nothing to be sure of.
Rick looked into Kines' dark face and asked him seriously:
	 - Did you herd him?
	 - His.
	 - Did he steal your client's car?
	 - Rick, I don't have a client at all right now. I'm out of work. I herd this guy on my own initiative. Is free.
	 - The reward from the police department- is also bread.
	 - What bread, crumbs alone!
	 - I'll tell you everything! - the hijacker's voice rang hysterically in Rick's ears. - If you promise me that there will be no armed resistance to the police in the case, I will tell you this that you guys will be stunned!
	 - He wants to tell us something, Kai. Let's hear the guy? Let him confess at last.
	 - Let's get out of here, Rick. I'll tell you everything about him myself. He's a bastard. Let it fly. I don't want to drag this piece of shit all over the roof. Even for reward, this business has already ceased to be profitable.
	 - This is reasonable. He himself will come down faster.- And Rick, pleased, laughed, loudly and cheerfully.
His recent shock has already subsided.
	 - I'll just open his fingers, - Kai bent over the lying Murklay. - Otherwise he will cling to his worthless life for another hour …
	 - I give up guys, I'll tell you everything! Honestly, no chatter! I ask you to!
	 - He's asking, Rick. He wants to tell us something.
Rick sighed, grimaced - his right shoulder was starting to hurt, and said, turning to Murklay:
	 - Speak.
	 - I'll tell you everything, everything.
A few seconds later, Murklay was lying on his stomach on the ridge of the roof. Rick searched him - the hijacker's pistol was not there. From the right pocket of Murklay's baggy trousers, Rick pulled out a parcel of paper.
	 - Kai shine something on me, I don't see a damn thing.
The bright light of an electric flashlight flashed in Kines's hand, Rick narrowed his eyes, grunted:
	 - Don't blind me.
The bundle was wrapped in blue tape. Rick ripped it off, tore the brown paper and whistled:
	 - Surprise.- There was a thick bundle of banknotes under the wrapping paper.
	 - I'll tell you everything.
Kai jabbed a pistol into the back of the head of Murklay's, who was lying face down, and said calmly:
	 - Any stupid trick, and I will shoot your head off.
	 - I’m everything.- Murklay was breathing heavily.
In the distance, from the direction of the fire escape, footsteps were heard. Rick looked around - a lone figure was heading in their direction.
	 - Don't shoot!- A deep voice shouted in the darkness.- Restaurant security. Do you need help?
	 - No,- Rick shouted back.- Come down and wait for us at the landing below. We will be soon.
	 - Clear.
The dark figure disappeared from view. The footsteps died away.
Here, on the dark roof, in the cold, damp wind, Rick, in his light suit, is chilled. He put the package he found at Murclay's in his trouser pocket.
	 - Tell me. Don't weary us.
	 - I took the Frisky 5 away,- Murklay spoke up, his voice trembling and gurgling with excitement.- First-class car. Do you know how much they give just for her engine? Five thousand!- There was sorrow in his voice.- I wanted to quit this business and go to the coast for the whole summer. Sun, ocean, girls …
	 - Cape Verde prison is also on the coast. - said Rick and touched his wounded shoulder, winced in pain. - Only it's cool there. You will sunbathe in the cell. Many years. And without the girls.
	 - I didn't want to hit you! It happened by accident!
	 - I believe you, boy. If what you say is a serious matter, then I will forget about your stupid trick with a pistol.
	 - Seriously? How serious! Eighty three thousand coins!
Kines Grain whistled, said:
	 - It's a bit too much for a guy like you. Didn't your mom teach you what to share with good people? It's a damn lot of money. I do not believe.
	 - It's true!
	 - Rick, do you believe in the good fairy?
	 - In the fairy? I believe in tax administration.
	 - They turned out to be fake. All the money was fake! But the quality is decent. I went to a huckster who agreed to take them for five percent. Well, I think four thousand is more than nothing. The devil messed with this shit. This is not my profile at all. I carried a sample of forgeries to show to the huckster.
Rick asked:
	 - Whose car?
	 - There were documents. But I already know its owner, I followed him for a week.
	 - Who?
For a few seconds Murklai was silent, apparently he wanted to emphasize the solemnity of the moment, then he answered:
	 - Dol Tsapuk. He has his own business in the capital, and here outside the city there is a workshop. They make expensive furniture.
	 - This is ridiculous.- Rick looked into the darkness where Kines’s face was visible.- Funny. Dol Tsapuk. It seems to me that this asshole is fooling our heads, Kai. Tsapuk is a wealthy type, influential. For him to contact the fakes? Nonsense. I do not believe.
	 - You want to sell us a rotten hare, kid?- Kaines chuckled.- This story is shitty. We will bring you down as promised - from the roof.
	 - It's true! The money is in my garage, in a cache.
	 - What is the address?
	 - River Lane, house seven. This is a voluntary confession! Voluntary!
Rick and Kines Grain were silent for a while.
	 - Interesting,- Rick said dryly.- Funny.
	 - We must take a guy, the sooner the better, - said Kaines. - Dol is an influential man.
	 - Come on. - Rick staggered back. - Get out of here. - And Murklay, - Get up.
After a couple of minutes, all three reached the fire escape, Murklai wounded in the left leg, and now and then screamed in pain. Rick looked down, saw a restaurant guard on the third floor landing, patiently standing by the railing, and said loudly:
	 - Take the load.
Somewhere down the street, a police siren sounded.
Drops of fine, cold rain began to fall from the gloomy sky.
Reaching the window through which he had recently climbed onto the fire escape, Rick climbed over the damp windowsill and found himself in the men's room. The guard, a tall, sturdy guy, with jet-black hair cut short, and the other, short, stocky, sturdy, were holding Murklay's, who was drooping and wincing with pain, under his arms. Standing outside the closed booths was a medium-sized blond, broad-shouldered, in a ripe plum tracksuit, and an expression of concern wandered across his elongated face.
Rick noticed a massive gold ring on the fingers of his left hand.
Kines easily climbed over the windowsill and stood next to Rick, the pistol no longer in his hand.
	 - Nice evening, guys,- he said with a smile.- How many of you warned these guys that the police came for them?
	 - All this is very unpleasant, Inspector, - the blond stood rooted to the spot, looked at Rick, he seemed not to notice Kynes. - I assure you that my people have nothing to do with it. We immediately called the police.- Without taking his eyes off Rick's face, he pointed with his left hand towards the private investigator.
	 - Mr. Ho, I suppose?
	 - Just a humble manager, - he held out his hand to Riku, introduced himself. - Ispak Joo. We have a decent establishment. You are hurt.
The toilet door flew open and a medium-sized, strong-built man burst into it, in crumpled checkered, black and blue trousers, whose best time had long passed, despite regular washing, and a blue, baggy sweater. No hat. His blond wavy hair stuck out in all directions, like a washcloth. The man held a pistol in his right hand, and a police badge in his left.
Abrom Chloe.
	 - Police! Ah ... Rick. So I look you are not ... Is this this one? - Abrom's bright eyes looked at the crumpled Murklay.
Rick's right shoulder ached. Both palms of his hands were covered in blood, and his jacket and trousers were a pitiful sight.
Rick was shivering.
He silently walked over to the white sink by the wall, opened the water, and nervously washed his hands.
Silently.
Nobody said a word.
	 - I want to see the waitress who served them.
	 - She’s already here,- Joo replied, nodding and not calling loudly.- Eloli!
The door to the toilet immediately opened and a young waitress, already familiar to Riku, entered and stopped in front of the men.
	 - Not here!- Rick winced.
	 - Mr. Inspector, I have not told anyone about you!
Rick grinned not cheerfully:
	 - I didn’t tell you, madam, that I a police inspector.
The girl silently looked at her boss, then, as if coming to her senses, turned her gaze to Rick's.
	 - Call Fresco,- the blond told her coldly, and the girl ran out into the corridor.
Rick wiped his wet hands on a stale waffle towel hanging from a hook next to the sink.
The towel had traces of dark spots.
The toilet door opened again and a tall guy, about twenty-five, with long, blond hair, in a checkered, fashionable suit entered. He carried two pistols in his hands, holding them by the barrels.
	 - The guys picked it up at the north wall,- he said, holding out the weapon to Riсk's.
Rick didn't thank him. He tucked his heavy, nine-shot Herk 32 into a holster under his jacket, the second pistol, a twelve-shot Oak 24, with a white bone grip, hid in his right pocket.
He looked at Murklay.
He was all wilted, shifted his weight to his left leg, looked at the floor.
	 - Nice gun,- Abrom growled.
	 - I need to call, - said Rick, referring to Joo. - From the telephone, which is not bugged by anyone.
	 - Inspector, I have a telephone in my office, - the blond was the very courtesy. - Come on.
	 - Ab, look here, - he threw. - Kai, thanks.
The manager's office was on the second floor, where a narrow wooden staircase, brightly lit by wall lamps, led. At the very beginning, a police sergeant of medium build, clean-shaven strong man, in a uniform cap pushed to the back of his head, literally ran into Rick's, who jumped out of the side door.
	 - Where? .. - interrupting himself in mid-sentence, the sergeant recognized Rick, saluted. - Good evening, lieutenant. - Behind him appeared the second sergeant.
	 - Kind. Is there a walkie-talkie in your car?
	 - Where from, Lieutenant?
	 - They're in the men's room. I soon.
Rick, along with the manager, went up to the office, a spacious mahogany paneled office with a massive table that had been in vogue thirty years ago. The wall, to the right of the window curtained with burgundy curtains, was decorated with a large oil painting depicting a sailing ship sinking in a storm. On the table stood a telephone and a bright lamp with bronze lion legs.
	 - He's at your disposal, Inspector.
Rick sat down at the table on the edge of a deep, soft chair, pulled the telephone towards him, when a plump man in a dark suit, about thirty, entered the open door softly and quietly.
Joo, who was about to leave, said introducing him:
	 - Inspector, this is our Mas. He will look at your hand. In the Navy, he served as a nurse.
	 - Thank you. Later. I need to make a call.
Both went out, closing the door tightly behind them.
Taking a wad of money from Murklay out of his trouser pocket, Rick carefully examined the top bill. Fake. Nice, solid fake. Putting the pack back in his pocket, he picked up the black telephone from the stand and contacted the switchboard:
	 - Girl, put me on 73-418. Extension 5. - Half a minute later, on the other side of the wire, something clicked, crackled, and Captain School's voice said irritably:
	 - Second police station. I'm listening.
	 - Dick, it's me. - Rick imagined the boss's bulging eyes on a full, flabby face and grinned. - We took Murklay.
	 - Well, take him here. You will figure it out yourself with this premature baby …
	 - That's not all. I need your help urgently. I can't talk about the circumstances of the case now, but I think time is running out.
	 - Let's!
	 - We need a search warrant and an arrest warrant. As soon as possible.
	 - On whom?
Rick lowered his voice, said:
	 - Dol Tsapuk.
For a few seconds there was deathly silence on the other side of the wire, and Rick looked at the sailboat in the picture, then the voice of Dick School shook the telephone receiver:
	 - Are you out of your mind? What the hell are you doing there? If I go to the city attorney with such a request, then tomorrow they will kick me out into the street! Fly to the station, here we will talk.
	 - Dick, there’s no time.
	 - To the station!
	 - Order.
	 - What's on it?
	 - This is not a telephone conversation. I need a sanction and a warrant. Believe me, this is a serious matter.
	 - What can you have on him? Over speed? Consider the reprimand in your pocket!
	 - Case eighteen,- Rick said calmly.
Case number 18 was opened due to the spread of counterfeit banknotes in the city. The captain was summoned almost every day to the city police department, where he and other captains of the stations were "warmed up".
"Warmed up", an expression of Dick School's himself.
	 - Are you sure of that?- Dick asked him.
	 - Not.
	 - What the hell are you calling me with this, and you still want me to put my head up? His city prosecutor is his friend! I will be eaten with …
	 - Call the district attorney, Dick. We have a witness. The clues he said …
	 - His words!- Dick shouted and Rick felt a ringing in his ear.- His words are nothing! Shit! Get him to the station …
	 - We're wasting time. More than one day has passed. Tomorrow might be late. The evidence may go away. I'm not sure if we can make it right now. It is necessary to conduct a search immediately, in Tsapuk's house, and at his enterprise outside the city. And do not hesitate with it. We go to his house. I have a bunch of counterfeit bills in my hands, worth a thousand coins. "Rick smiled." Promotion, Dick. You will even be given a medal. And send us guys.
	 - So what the hell, you didn't say right away ?! …
When the boss's voice exploded with abuse, Rick hung up the phone receiver on the brass stand with a grin and got to his feet.
Ten minutes later, with a bandaged shoulder, he walked through the restaurant hall - in front of two sergeants, almost dragging Murklay's.
Kines followed Rick.
Leaning over to the table at which he had recently sat, Rick removed his black cloak from the back of the chair.
A bottle of expensive cognac disappeared without a trace.
It was raining in full force outside, cold and strong, the gusts of wind chilled the face.
Wincing at the pain in his right hand, Rick donned his mud-stained cloak as he walked. The police headed for a car parked on the sidewalk.
	 - Abrom, - said Rick, referring to Abrom Chloe, shrinking chilly in his sweater. - You stay here, draw up a protocol. Everything is as it should be. Here you are. It was with Murklay, - he gave Abrom a pack of counterfeit bills.
	 - I need a glass of vodka. I was chilled to the bone.
Kines was standing there.
	 - I'm in my car,- Kines's voice said from behind him.
	 - You have nothing to do there, - muttered Rick in response. - Don't poke your nose. I will write in the report on your participation, you will receive an award.
He stopped, looking into the face of the private investigator.
	 - My baby has a forced engine. I will not get under my feet.
Kines put his hat on his head, he was without a cloak.
	 - Do you know where Tsapuk's house is?
	 - I even know where his dogs urinate.
Rick walked up to the police car - Murklay's, who was whining in pain, already handcuffed, was unceremoniously pushed into the back seat, one of the sergeants grumbled:
	 - Couldn't get drunk during the day, freak?
	 - Follow us, - Rick told them. - In the city turn on the siren, we go quietly outside the city.
	 - I see.
An old, black "Arno 8", famously rolled up to the curb, where Rick was soaking in the rain, the door opened and he sat down next to Kines.
The car started moving.
The roof awning was leaking, and rare drops of water fell on the instrument panel, where the dial of the speedometer glowed dimly.
Behind them, a police siren whined shrilly, the bright headlights of the car following them glinting in the rear-view mirrors.
	 - Your junk won't fall apart on the way?
Kines laughed and replied:
	 - She'll outlive you, Rick.
Rick.
	 - Of little faith. The crow uncoiled.
He looked into the face of the private investigator, his nose sharpened, his eyes glittering in the dark, rainwater dripping from his hat.
	 - I bought her cheap. I have a good friend - a kind of talent. He made candy out of it. Your police coffins won't catch up with her.
They rushed forward, skipping intersections, scaring away passers-by, cars gave them the way, "wipers" tirelessly knocked down streams of rain from the windshield.
Kines turned on the radio and, looking at the road, turned the knob of the receiver - in the cabin of the car, the orchestra of Sparkling Waterfall sounded hoarsely.
	 - I love "Bass Gateway's".
Kines chuckled silently.
They rushed through the blocks of the business part of the city, they turned east, where the buildings of the industrial zone of Quiet Harbor's stretched, and the river water darkened to the right. Somewhere far beyond the low horizon, the blue light of spring lightning flashed.
The bright headlights pierced the rain wall and drowned in the flickering white line of road markings. A few minutes later, leaving behind the gloomy buildings of the textile factory's warehouses, with the rare lights of the lanterns, the car swerved around a bend and, picking up speed, rushed past the dark thickets of a spruce forest that grows on both sides like high walls of a fairytale castle.
	 - It’s unlikely that we’ll find anything there.- Kines stared into the windshield.- It's been two days.
	 - We'll see.
	 - How's your shoulder?
	 - Fine.
In the damp salon "Arno", the Sparkling Waterfall orchestra was straining, their soloist's voice sang:
	Dance, dance, dance
	All night, all night.
	Starry night, your night.
	 - Where is your mother, where is your home? ... - Kynes tightened the motive and the words of the song.
His face at that moment was pensive, and somehow stupid.
The private investigator had no musical ear.
And Rick laughed.


                                               *******                                   *******



Tsapuk's house is a three-story mansion, bulky, brick, with a high gable roof, hiding behind a forged fence. On the other side of the gate was a tiny guard's house, with a yellow light in its only window. A short alley of bare, spreading trees led to the master's house, where, in the light of two bright lanterns, a parking lot was guessed.
The rain stopped pouring. Black puddles lay on the asphalt road.
Kines drove the car up to the gate with the headlights off, turned off the engine. The radio was off and silent. They silently climbed out of the Arno's salon and headed for the gate. The shadowy figure of the guard was already waiting for them at the gate.
	 - Police. - Rick pointed into the darkness his, hidden in a leather case, police badge. - Open the gate.
An electric torch flashed in the guard's hands, and its pale beam illuminated Rick's face.
At that moment, a police car was taxiing to the gate - the headlights were on, on its roof the red light of the lantern was burning brightly.
	 - Take away the light!- Rick closed his eyes.
	 - Good evening, gentlemen, - the guard spoke calmly, the beam of his flashlight slid over Kines's face, then rested on the police car for a long time. - For what reason are you here?
	 - Listen, friend, - Rick began to get annoyed. - Can't you see who is in front of you? We are not peddlers of newspapers. Open the gate!
	 - I must report your arrival to Mr. Tsapuk. One minute.
The guard, a large and tall man, was already turning away from them, about to leave for his house, when Kines briefly told him in the trail:
	 - Have you gone to get your things?
The guard turned to the private investigator, confusion in his low voice.
	 - For what things?
	 - For those that will be useful to you in the cell. - Kines seemed indifferent. - Warn your boss and you will share the bunk with him in prison. Complicity is not a good accusation.
Kines calmly lit a cigarette, smoked, a red glow falling on his face.
Rick chuckled, silently watched what was happening - in the end, Kines gave out an unofficial version.
	 - You’re going to be an accomplice, lad,- the private investigator smiled at him with a friendly smile.- For murder.
	 - I didn't kill anyone.
	 - They'll figure it out.
	 - You must have an arrest warrant.- The guard shifted from foot to foot.
	 - The warrant will be delivered in an hour. - Kines pushed his hat to the back of his head. - I see that you are not in the know. An escort will arrive now, and you create a bad impression of yourself. You know how it is.
	 - I have rights!
	 - Don't be too tired.
One of the policemen came up from behind, stopped next to Rick and silently looked at the guard.
He finally made up his mind, reached into the pocket of his uniform jacket - a bunch of keys rang in his hands, clicked the lock and, without saying a word, began to open the gate.
They went back to Kines' car and Rick asked:
	 - In murder?
	 - It always works, Rick.
The motor roared, jerked and they moved through the open gate along the asphalt road to the house.
	 - Will your boss get a search and arrest warrant?
	 - It will.
Kines stopped the car in front of a high stone porch; the engine stopped, the headlights went out.
Both went out into the wet night.
Behind the massive doors of the mansion, in the illuminated glass, a figure loomed. The police car was just stopping next to the "Arno" when Rik's and Kines's, who had climbed the steps of the porch, opened the high, front door. Before them stood a handsome old man of medium height in a footman's livery.
	 - Police.- Rick unceremoniously thrust his badge under his nose and, without waiting for an invitation, entered the brightly lit front door.
They didn't save electricity here. Electric lamps burned brightly in a huge glass chandelier under the ceiling.
Kines followed Rick in.
A policeman climbed the stairs, the second did not get out of the car.
	 - We need Mr. Tsapuk. Dol Tsapuk.- Rick tucked the badge into the inside pocket of his jacket, his unbuttoned cloak gleaming with mud.
	 - Mr. Tsapuk is at home. I will report to him about you, gentlemen.
	 - It's too much. Just walk us over to him,- Rick said, and turning to the policeman, said,- Stay here, Sergeant.
	 - Yes.
	 - Not to let anyone out.
Rick turned to face the footman when a tall, overweight man in a light gray suit and gray felt slippers stepped out of the side door on the right. His suit jacket was unbuttoned, and his white shirt with a gleaming gold pin glowed brightly in the light of the electric lamps. On his round, friendly face, as if glued, parted in a friendly smile, red, short mustache, long red bangs covered his light eyebrows.
	 - What do I owe you, gentlemen?- He asked, in a baritone that any theater actor would envy.- Has something happened?
He stopped two paces from Rick, taking turns examining the faces of the visitors.
Tsapuk didn’t look worried.
	 - Good evening. - Rick again reached into his pocket for a police badge. - Mr. Dol Tsapuk?
	 - It’s more like night, gentlemen. And what is the matter?
	 - Are you Dol Tsapuk?- Rick showed him his badge.- Lieutenant Rickslem Yark.
	 - Naturally me, - he was still smiling the noblest smile that Rick had ever seen. - Why are you here to see me at such a late hour? The guard did not warn me. Hmm- He turned to the footman and as if fleetingly said to him .- Warn Odi that from tomorrow he will be fired .- And already Rick's .- And so?
	 - Mr. Tsapuk, you are arrested on charges of making counterfeit money, we must conduct a search.
	 - Do you have a warrant for this, gentlemen?
	 - The order will be delivered in half an hour.
	 - So you don't have a warrant?
	 - Not with me.
	 - Gentlemen, I am surprised. - on the face of the owner of the house appeared a feigned surprise. - You broke into my house without a warrant, in the middle of the night, bypassing the guards, with ridiculous accusations. How should I understand this?
	 - The accusation is not funny.
	 - Not funny at all. - Tsapuk looked at Rick point-blank and his large, colorless eyes did not show even a shadow of embarrassment. - And I am wealthy enough not to draw false papers.
Rick listened silently to his words.
He was already beginning to doubt the wisdom of their visit to Tsapuk's.
	 - I’ll call the city prosecutor right away.- Tsapuk did not move, he stood like an idol.- You can say goodbye to your badge, Lieutenant.
	 - I will not rush, he is dear to me. - Rick looked straight into his eyes. - Where can I call?
	 - Not from my house, Lieutenant. I demand that you leave my domain immediately. Immediately!You are not very nice with the police, Mr. Tsapuk, - said Rick. - We will be back.
	 - I strongly doubt it.- Tsapuk no longer smiled, an expression of stony calm appeared on his broad face.
	 - Leaving the house, all three - Rick, Kines and the sergeant went down the stairs to the cars. As he walked towards the police car, Rick heard the sergeant's grumbling voice behind him.
	 - Yeah. Somehow it turned out sourly.
He opened the back door behind which, leaning back on the back of the sofa, sat in the darkness, handcuffed Murklai.
The sergeant was already getting behind the wheel, the second sergeant was looking half-round from the front seat.
	 - I don't like talkers, boy. - Rick looked into Murklay's dark face. - And you look like a talker.
	 - I told you the truth. - Murklai spoke quietly, almost in a whisper, but the desire to make his voice more convincing, gave the impression that someone was strangling him. - The fakes were in the car. Tsapuk's car. I have it in my garage.
	 - I'll shoot you for trying to escape.
	 - I'm not running anywhere!
	 - If you lied to me ... - Rick straightened up and, closing the car door, looked back.
Kines stood a step away from him, staring boredly at the wheel of a police car, his hat pushed to the back of his head and the light of a street lamp illuminating his face.
	 - Let's go, Kai.
He did not move.
	 - We can't leave, Rick.
	 - We’ll wait outside the gate when the car arrives with a warrant.
	 - It's a long song. They will sing it without us.
	 - Uh-huh. You have an idea.
	 - I have a lot of ideas. I'm not a cop, Rick. I have nothing to do outside the gate.
He took a step towards the private investigator, spoke not loudly:
	 - Share your thoughts.
	 - Workshop of forgeries is here.
Rick chuckled, said:
	 - Is that a scent?
	 - I saw an oiled rag in the hallway. They tried to shove her behind the shoe rack, but I could see it. A dirty, oily rag in a house like that, in a hallway?
	 - Maybe just dirt? How did you decide that it is in oil?
	 - Smell.
	 - I'll shoot you both, along with Murklay's.
	 - Will you spare me the agony in the tax office?
They both laughed.
	 - I'll make you a black suit, Kai.
It was a fashionable song among the youth of workers' districts - "I will sew you a black suit."
They walked to the private investigator's car, and Kines began to whine mournfully the painful tune of the song:
	 “I will sew for you
	 black suit.
	 You will be very beautiful
	 like the mayor.
	 You lie in a coffin
	 and nothing else
	 you don't want to take away from this world...”
Rick shook his head - the clown, and that's all.
	 - Get behind the wheel, drop me over there behind those trees. I'm taking a walk here.- Kines turned his face to him, his even, white teeth flashing in a smile.
	 - For your profession, Kai, you have too many teeth.
They walked to Kines' car and, sitting behind the steering wheel, Rick watched the private investigator sit down next to him.
He started the engine and they rolled out after the long police car, without turning on the headlights, drove along the asphalt road past tall, dark trees.
	 - Stop here.
Rick braked the car - Kines easily and quickly jumped out of the cabin into the night, carefully closing the door behind him.
Having driven to the gate, where the lonely figure of the guard loomed, he heard through the noise of engines, a short shout from the policeman:
	 - Open up!
The gates flew open and both cars stretched out to the driveway, froze a few meters from the forged fence with the bald bushes growing under it, and fell silent.
The headlights went out.
The night air was cool and clear. It smelled of rotten leaves.
A sergeant got out of the police car, the one who was driving and, shuffling on the asphalt, approached the car. Rick opened the side window, looked out into the darkness.
	 - It turned out to be shitty, Lieutenant,- the sergeant said, not loudly and dryly. He lit a cigarette and, bending his head to the open window of the car, calmly finished. - This fat man will drink blood from you. You will see.
	 - We are waiting for the car from the site. Then we will go to him according to all the rules.
The sergeant looked into the salon.
	 - And this guy?
	 - What guy?
	 - Uh-huh. It is a pity that we do not have a walkie-talkie.
The sergeant left, climbed into the police car, throwing his cigarette butt over the fence - the red ember of his cigarette drew a bright arc and crashed into the night on an invisible branch, blazing goodbye with a sheaf of bright splashes.
Rick lit a cigarette, smoked out the window.
He didn’t like the idea that Murklai had invented everything. If this is so, then there will be a lot of noise, all the newspapers will vying with each other to shout about the "arbitrariness of the police", about the "oppression of honest citizens." Dick School's will again "warm up the back of the head", and Rick himself, most likely, will be deprived of the prize.
He sat, looking into the night and listening to the quiet night, hidden behind a high, forged fence, whose sharp pins protruded with black teeth, against the background of the reflections of the distant master's house. The wind rustled up the trees, it was getting cold and damp.
To distract himself, Rick began to think that it would be nice to get a thermos for such a case, or even better to take it as a habit to carry a couple of sandwiches with him, as many do ...
A shot rang out.
And immediately the second.
	 - Open the gate, damn it!- The sergeant shouted so that he was probably heard on the other side of the Firmness's.
The engines roared, the guard had already opened the gates in front of the policemen, huddled to the side, the headlights of the cars flashed, and with the howl of the siren on, they rushed along the wet road to the house.
Rick was driving the Arno two steps away from the red, burning lights of the police car, and barely avoided a collision when it began to brake on the landing near the front porch of the mansion. He stopped the "Arno" right behind the owner's luxurious "Lock 100", cutting off the possibility of a sudden departure, turned off the engine and jumped out of the passenger compartment, taking a pistol from his chest holster.
Both policemen, pistols in hand, ran to the front door.
Kines's, was nowhere to be seen.
Two street lamps, brightly illuminated everything around.
	 - Kai!
Silence.
He saw the door open in front of the police and the footman nervously said:
	 - Shooting, on the street!
	 - One in the house, the second with me! - Rick shouted to the policemen. - Don't let anyone out.
The sergeant-driver ran down the stairs to Rick's.
	 - Wait here. - said Rick, turning to leave. - I'll go around the house …
And at that moment they saw Kines.
He was not alone.
Kines Grain walked behind an average height, stocky man dressed in a dirty blue work suit and trampled sneakers, no hat, his bald head glowed dull in the light of the lanterns, he stepped heavily on his left leg, his arms out to the sides.
In appearance, the stranger was about forty years old - a round, beardless face with small, close-set eyes, winced in pain.
Kines had two pistols in his hands.
The police silently waited for the men to approach, and when they approached, Rick calmly asked:
	 - Who is this?
	 - I think this is a good friend of our hospitable host. - Kines thrust one of the pistols into the pocket of his unbuttoned jacket, and the barrel of the second rested between the shoulder blades of the bald one. - You bad shooter. - And already Rik's. - He shot me from ten paces and missed.
	 - I’m hurt,- the bald man said dryly.
His voice was low and hoarse, the man was leaning over, shifting his weight to his right, healthy leg.
	 - You won't die, - Rick nodded to the sergeant and he took out shiny handcuffs from his belt, and going up to the wounded man, put his hands behind his back and bound them. - We go into the house.
They went up the stairs.
In the hallway, there were still light lamps of electric lighting burning brightly on the ceiling and walls, pasted over with expensive "flowers" wallpaper, the sergeant was standing three steps from the door and wet traces of his dirty shoes remained on the expensive carpet. In his right hand he held a pistol.
Dol Tsapuk was right there. He was standing not far from the right wall of the hallway, a step away from the footman, and his noble face was imprinted with no less noble bewilderment.
	 - What's going on here, gentlemen?- Tsapuk asked in his velvet voice.- And who is this tramp?
Rick stepped forward and said:
	 - Tell us who he is and what he did here. Sergeant, start searching.
	 - I called the city attorney, Lieutenant. You can part with your pension.
One of the sergeants went through the front door and disappeared through the door on the left, the second made the bald man sit on the floor, while he remained standing next to him.
	 - My pension is not going anywhere. Do you know this person?
	 - This is the first time I see him. He's wounded, as I understand it.- Tsapuk looked puzzled at the one sitting on the floor.- He stained my carpet with blood.
Kines meanwhile, without further ado, peeped behind the lacquered mahogany shoe rack to the right of the wall, and, reaching behind it, pulled out a gray, dirty rag.
	 - You love the technique, Mr. Tsapuk,- he said politely, approaching Rick's and holding his find in front of him.
Rick took the rag in his left hand.
A cotton rag that once served as a T-shirt and was covered in traces of dirt and machine oil.
	 - Do you have a car workshop in your house?- He asked Tsapuk.- Do you work part-time by repairing cars?
	 - Odi, what is this? - The owner of the house looked at the old man-lackey in bewilderment. - Where does this rubbish in my house come from?
	 - She was not, Mr. Tsapuk! Before the arrival of the police, she was not there.
	 - Do you look behind that stand so often?- Rick grinned at the old man's face.
The footman did not answer.
Rick turned to the detainee sitting on the floor and asked:
	 - Name?
He silently turned away.
	 - Now our guys will be here, Mr. Tsapuk, - said Rick. - I officially notify you that you are arrested on suspicion of making counterfeit banknotes, so I do not advise you to tempt fate by resisting the authorities. Sergeant!
	 - I've got handcuffs in the car, Lieutenant. Now.
He quickly ran to the police car and soon Tsapuk's and his old footman were handcuffed.
	 - Be with him,- Rick said to the sergeant and nodded at the wounded man.- We’ll look around the house.
	 - I'm bleeding!- The bald man said with a note of indignation in his voice.- You must send me to the hospital.
Rick looked at Kines's, who was standing next to him, who grinned and said:
	 - This girl will live. The bone is not hurt, the bullet has passed through the pulp, the bleeding is weak. Will not die.
	 - Come on.
Rick divided the detainees, kept Tsapuk's with him, and entrusted Kines with the footman. They spent more than an hour in Tsapuk's huge house, walked around all the rooms, looked into the basement - nothing suspicious. The footman was helpful and pitiful; he showed the house to the "gentlemen policemen" with servile servility. Tsapuk, on the other hand, grumbled and snapped.
The search didn’t give anything - the police didn’t find anything.
Gathering everyone except Kines's in the living room of the house, he sent the second sergeant outside to watch. Rick collapsed in a deep chair, and stared at the floor in puzzlement.
A large living room was located on the first floor of the house, in its left wing. In the middle of it stood five wide, soft armchairs, with armrests trimmed with burgundy plush, the windows were covered with satin, dark green curtains embroidered with gold monograms, with the letters "D" and "T", a bright red carpet - a huge, stitched with silver, bedspread the entire floor of the living room, and its deep pile, literally called upon Rick's to take off his wet shoes and immerse his tired legs in him.
To the left of the entrance door to the living room there was a huge marble fireplace, and above it, reaching the very ceiling, hung a portrait of the owner of the house - Tsapuk in a terry dressing gown looked thoughtfully from the portrait, somewhere in the direction of the dark, night windows.
Kines appeared at the door. He took a cigarette from his cigarette case and lit it with a gas lighter.
	 - They don't smoke here!- Tsapuk's voice for the first time in all the time rose angrily to a scream, his broad face covered with red spots.
	 - Yes?- Kines raised his eyebrows in surprise, his childish eyes widening.- It's never too late to get used to good traditions.
Rick lit a cigarette too.
	 - Lieutenant, can I have you a minute?- Kines looked indifferent.
Rick was tired, getting out of the chair for no particular reason, he didn't want to. He looked at the sergeant standing near the door, and he waved him back with a pistol.
	 - Everything will be all right, Lieutenant.
Tsapuk, the footman, and the wounded man sat together on the larger sofa, looking at the police.
Grunting, Rick got to his feet and followed the private investigator out into the corridor.
	 - Well?
	 - I found something, Rick. Let's go to.
They walked almost the entire wide corridor, past the open door where the owner's library was located.
A light was on in the library.
Kines ushered Rick to the next large room, with a plush pool table — through the open door, a glass liquor bar and a huge, narrow mirror by the window could be seen through the open door.
	 - And?
The private investigator chuckled at Rick's face.
	 - Rick, how many steps from the hall to the extreme wall of the billiard room?
Rick looked at Kines blankly and said with irritation:
	 - Listen, buddy, I'm tired, wet and hungry …
	 - Twenty two. The library is ten, the billiard room itself is ten.
	 - I'm listening to you.
	 - Rick, - he stopped grinning. - Have you forgotten how to count? Two meters are missing! They couldn't go anywhere. I counted steps, but I could not be so wrong.
It was only now that Rick realized what Kines was trying to explain to him, and he laughed out loud.
	 - Damn him, - he shook his head, and moved to the library. - Well, son of a bitch.
	 - I’m already beginning to worry about your mental faculties.- Kines followed behind him.
	 - Here's a son of a bitch.
	 - Who? Me or Tsapuk?
	 - You both.
The library, as befits a place like this, lined the walls with tall bookcases, lacquered shelves, gleaming dark red, and smelled of books. By the window was a wide desk, with an antique bronze lamp under a yellow shade, the library's only armchair upholstered in plum-colored velvet, pulled up close to the table. The floor was covered with parquet.
Kines and Rick stopped at a bookcase, behind which was a wall separating the two rooms.
	 - Looks perfect, Kai. Maybe you didn’t count well after all?
Kines bent down and looked down at his feet.
	 - And here is the path to wealth, Rick. - He pointed to two barely noticeable marks on the parquet, most likely from the wheels of the sliding door. - Will we break or ask the owner of the house to open the chest?
	 - We will break the closet. - Rick felt cheerful. - There should be a crowbar in the police car.
Then they heard the noise of voices from the corridor.
	 - It seems a heavy cavalry has arrived,- said Kines, and looked Rick's in the face.
They went out into the corridor, literally colliding with Dick School. Behind Dick, a stone's throw from the open door of the room with the arrested, two police officers stood still – shavetail lieutenants Frou Ool and Mirol Dar.
Dick, as befits a captain and chief, was gloomy and irritable, the scar on his right cheek gleamed pink, his bald patch gleamed yellow, his small black eyes looked evil. His gray and wet hat he held in his left hand, a cigarette was smoking in his right. Dick's black cloak was wet - it was raining again outside.
	 - You got a warrant for Tsapuk's?
	 - What’s this guy doing here?- Dick was never almond and was often rude to others, but not to his superiors.- This is not a diner.
	 - Dick, he saved my life today. In addition, it was he who launched the Tsapuk case.
Dick looked straight into Kines' face, took a drag on his cigarette, blew out a jet of gray smoke, and said hoarsely:
	 - I don’t care Grain what Rick is talking about. I will tolerate your presence here, but do not meddle in this matter. It is clear?
	 - Good evening, Captain.- Kines smiled at him the most affable smile, and held out his hand.
Dick hesitated for a moment, but then shook Kines' hand.
	 - There was a devilish scandal, - said the captain to Rick's: - If we don't find anything, they'll eat me. You too. "He took off his hat and shook off the water, put it on his bald head." I was at the district attorney. He has nothing to do with Tsapuk's, everything went smoothly, but Judge Khramk arranged a rout for me. We may not be on the police force tomorrow, Rick. I put my trust in you. And who shot that bastard?
	 - I,- Kines said modestly.- I have his pistol.
	 - Dick, do you have a warrant or not?
	 - I have a warrant, damn you all! I'm soaked like a mongrel! Now lay out what you dug up here.
Rick entered the library, followed by Dick and Kines. The latter did not say a word, letting Rick's bring the captain up to date.
As Rick spoke, Dick School's round face showed nothing but suppressed irritation. The idea of a secret entrance to the basement of the house, Rick presented him at the end of his story.
As soon as the captain heard about the tracks on the floor, his eyes sparkled with joy, and he almost shouted out:
	 - You should have started with this!- He gruntingly hunched over in his belt, examining the parquet floor near the bookcase.- Here they are scoundrels!- He straightened up, looked at Rick and Kines, said animatedly.- I myself will interrogate these darlings. Frou! Okay, let's feel them for their udders.
A minute later they entered the room where the arrested and the police were waiting for them. Rick leaned against the wall next to Kines and watched the show. Dick stopped in front of Tsapuk, his footman and the wounded, who were sitting on the sofa, he stood with his legs wide apart and his hands behind his back, an extinguished cigarette sticking out in the corner of his mouth.
	 - I'm the captain of the second section, Dick School. Here is a warrant from the district attorney for your arrest, Mr. Tsapuk. - He pulled out a sheet of paper from his inner pocket, glistening with water, raincoat, and shook it in front of Tsapuk's nose, then put it back.- You better tell us the details of the case right away, then the court will credit it to you.
	 - They don't smoke here, captain.- Tsapuk stared into Dick's face.
	 - Hmm. Yes, what are you saying?- Dick threw a cigarette butt onto the expensive carpet and crushed it with the toe of his boot.- Sergeant. Take this baby boy and take him to the prison hospital. No, it might wait. And so Tsapuk, - he did not add the word "Mr." - You do not want to confess?
	 - I have nothing to confess to you! You will still greatly regret all this.
	 - I don’t think so. Sergeant, is there a crowbar in your car?
	 - That's right, Captain.
	 - Carry it.
The sergeant returned three minutes later, carrying a short crowbar in his hand.
Dick School swayed forward slightly, his red-cheeked face breaking into a triumphant smile:
	 - I'll show you, Tsapuk, one interesting thing. And yes, now you will be sorry. It is a pity that you did not want to voluntarily confess everything, now the chance is missed...
Rick watched Dick boredly, he did not like it when he fell into moralizing and posturing.



                                           *******                                         *******


Tsapuk and his entire gang had just been put into two of the three police cars that had arrived with the captain.
The rain had passed, the wind had calmed down, but it was as if it were colder than a couple of hours ago, it seemed that the dark sky, covered with heavy clouds, was taking away the remnants of heat from the Firmness, soaked behind night.
Rick stood next to the police car in which Dick arrived, the steady light of a red lantern was burning on its sloping roof, the entire driveway near the high porch was occupied by cars - the police were scolding, the cars were already humming with motors, trying to part ways.
Dick, in his gray hat pushed to the back of his head, looked like a bazaar huckster. Opening the front passenger door, he suddenly remembered something, turned to Rick's and said:
	 - You will write the report tomorrow. Now go to Guy's and tidy him up as you like.
	 - Captain, - Rick did not want to call Dick by his name in the presence of Kines, who was standing next to him. - Guy has a cold. He has a sick leave …
Dick took a step towards Rick's, his eyes, sunk in the shadow of his hat, like two black dips:
	 - He's on a binge again, and your Laina covers him! In short, if he does not show up for service tomorrow, he will fly out into the street to hell. I have enough hassle without him.- Dick turned to the car, began to climb into the dark interior, his voice took on the color of a dying, mortally wounded soldier.- This day finished me off, the judge squeezed the last juices out of me …
The door slammed shut, the engine roared, and the car pushed forward, turning awkwardly, honking other police cars.
	 - Come on, Rick.- Kines looked at his parked car.
A few minutes later, everyone parted - Kines car sped along the dark road, the wet asphalt sparkling in the two bright beams of its headlights.
	 - Where to throw you?
	 - On twenty-sixth street, where the Silhouette department store is.
Kines glanced at the luminous dial of the dashboard clock, shook his head.
	 - Half past one night, Rick. Maybe I'll throw you home?
	 - Not. It's early yet. I'll visit my partner first.
Kines said nothing.
Rick was shaking a little, he gritted his teeth so that they would not chatter, and stared out the side window, looking at the flickering ghosts of the trees.
	 - Look in the glove compartment. There should still be.
Rick looked - he fumbled in the dark for the knob on the dashboard, opened the small door that dangled on bad hinges and pulled out a flat, leather-covered flask.
He took one gulp from the flask, then a second, held his breath - the vodka jerked into his stomach, hit hard in the nose, flared up inside with a pleasant warmth. Rick exhaled, screwed on the cap of the flask.
	 - No appetizer,- Kines laughed.
He put the flask back into the glove compartment, took out a cigarette, lit two at once, and handed the second one to Kines.
	 - Now I definitely will not die, - Rick laughed contentedly, Kines, looking at the road, gripping a cigarette in his teeth, bared his teeth.
	 - It’s a pity that my stove doesn’t work,- said the private investigator.- Always, something is wrong.
	 - That's for sure.
	 - The captain will probably write you a prize. The printing press in the basement pulls for a medal.
	 - Unlikely. He became stingy when he got the captain. - Rick smiled to himself, looked at the road now. - He started with us, an ordinary guard. Then he went up. Now this is a different Dick.
	 - How many years have you been in the police?
	 - Lot. Probably all my life. Dick used to be a normal guy. We were with him like that, - he showed Kines a clenched fist. - And we went under the bullets more than once. It's just that people tend to forget.
	 - It happens.
	 - How long have you been engaged in private investigation, Kai?- Rick felt the vodka gradually untie a tightly twisted knot, somewhere deep in his soul, and he wanted to talk.
	 - As soon as I retired.
	 - Where from?
	 - From aviation. Army aviation. I was a K-23 pilot, Rick. I was not a bad pilot. Now I am a retired lieutenant.
Rick looked into Kines' face - a dark, frozen mask with a cigarette sticking out of his mouth. He did not ask him about the reason for resignation, but Kines himself said:
	 - The medical commission found my heart unfit for flight. My heart. I always thought that my heart would never fail me. Never.
Rick could not find what to say, was silent.
	 - I remember flying over the ocean at night. If there is anything in this life, it is the sky and the ocean of the night, Rick.
	 - Almost like it is now
	 - Almost like it’s now.- Kines glanced at Rick, his face smiling.
	 - Why did you become a detective? You could go to us, to the police.
	 - To the captain under the heel? I'd rather be alone. And then, Rick, in the police on duty, alcohol is not allowed, and I have my own convictions on this matter. I am a free bird.
Rick chuckled.
	 - At least you don't drink while driving.
	 - I don't drink while driving.
	 - Beliefs too?
	 - Yes. I once had a client. One drunk guy hit her son at a bus stop. The guy died. Witnesses could not read his license plate, they only saw his car drive away, wobbling from side to side. I then searched for him for a long time.
	 - Found?
	 - No. - Kines paused. - It's only in books, scoundrels are always caught and the truth triumphs. In life, everything is different.
Soon the car drove into the city blocks - passed the bridge, passed the Gorny stadium, turned onto Fourteenth Street and rushed along East's Avenue.
The sidewalks were deserted, the light of street lamps glittered in the calm, flat mirrors of the puddles, the dark windows of houses around, looked with sleepy indifference into the night, reflecting the lights of street advertising posters illuminated by electric lamps.
They drove past a lonely taxi.
Traffic lights, as always at night, burned with a yellow warning light. In the middle of the street appeared the bulky building of the department store "Silhouette" - dark, asleep.
	 - Right behind the Silhouette,- Rick said.
The car slowed down and swerved, turned into an alleyway, into a wide, unlit courtyard of municipal houses.
	 - Kai, stop at the second entrance.
They stopped in front of a seven-story brick house, where, in the darkness of liquid trees, the buildings of a playground were guessed.
A dim lamp shone dimly above the front door to the entrance.
Rick and Kines looked at each other.
	 - It was a good evening, Rick.
	 - Yes, the evening was a success. It's a shame you don't have enough booze.
	 - I didn't know there was going to be a party.
They laughed.
Rick opened the door, thought and said:
	 - Do you have business in the morning?
	 - No, you just need to feed the cat.
	 - Come on.
	 - Rick, I wouldn't want to …
	 - Consider the party going on.
	 - Do you think this is a good idea?
	 - That's a good idea, Kai.
	 - Okay. I'll drive the car away now.
Rick got out of the car, lit a cigarette and watched as the old Arno-8, growling and choking with exhaust gases, disappeared into the darkness of the courtyard, the engine roaring in the silence of the night rumbled like a machine-gun burst.
Finally, everything was quiet.
Kines emerged from the darkness.
They entered the porch of the house, which smelled of cats and urine, and began to climb a narrow, concrete staircase. The shabby, dimly lit walls were a dead end in the life of local residents - the oil paint burst and in places hung in pitiful, dull rags, here and there the gaze caught the words written by something, and more often the scrawled words - “Jani and Yuk= love”, “ Bogeyman a fool "," bitches ", and so on.
Rick saw these inscriptions many, many times, new ones were added to the old ones, he knew their authors, even saw them in his area. The aforementioned Jani has been married for five years and left with her husband for the capital, and Yuk, a blond and thin boy, died three years ago. Rick did not know why he died, and he was not interested.
Bogeyman
He chuckled bitterly.
Bogeyman was the name of an old woman who lived here fifteen years ago, and who loved to peep through the crack of the open door of her apartment.
Old age is like that - it deprives many of the mind, and instills absurd habits and interests.
Rick didn't like to think about his old age.
They went up to the fifth floor.
The staircase was half-dark. Rick turned right, walked forward along a narrow corridor, and stopped in front of a brown, shabby door, waited for Kines, and when he approached, knocked.
No one answered him, not after a minute or two. Then Rick began pounding on the door with force, banging his fist against it.
The thunder of blows echoed down the corridor.
	 - You will wake up the neighbors.
	 - I'm from the police,- Rick chuckled.
Some kind of fuss was heard behind the door and, after a few seconds, the sounds of the opening of the lock notified those who came about the awakening of the owner of the apartment.
	 - Go to hell, you bastards!- The voice behind the door, low and hoarse, belonged to Rick's partner, Guy Ool's.
	 - He's not happy,- said Kines.
	 - Pay no attention. Guy Ool is a quick-witted and hospitable guy.
	 - Hmm.
The door flew open. The bright light of an electric lamp blinded Rick's eyes. Guy Ool, a fat, forty-year-old man, balding, with a small nose on a round face, stood in the doorway in shorts and a T-shirt. Guy's undershirt was tucked into his shorts. In his left hand the landlord was holding a short-barreled pistol "Ahai 37".
	 - What do you want?
	 - Guy, put the gun away, - Rick did not move, he waited for his partner's eyes to focus on his face. - Your sick leave is over.
For a few seconds, Guy Ool's red face changed expression from rage to confusion, then he broke into a childish, shy smile and, walking back into the apartment, began to mutter:
	 - Rick, damn you. Come on in. I thought …
	 - What did you think?- Rick walked in first, followed by Kines into the hallway.
	 - I already thought ... And who is this? - Guy's watery eyes, opened wide. - Weasel Kines! Let me die!
	 - Guy, this is my friend. - said Rick calmly, closing the door. - His name is Kai.
	 - Yes? - it seemed that Guy's eyes could not open even wider, but they opened. - Since when?
	 - He saved my life today.
Guy Ool looked at the guests, shifting his gaze from one to the other, a pistol still in his hand.
	 - Come on in. To the kitchen. I am now.
Rick and Kines, shoes on, walked into the small kitchen, where the mess was chronic, and sat down at a small table, occupying the only two chairs there.
Before sitting down, Kines suspiciously examined the chair, even tried to shake it.


                                              *******                                  *******


                                                                  Chapter two.


                                                                       Night.

A pile of dirty dishes turned sour in the enamel sink, and an electric lamp, sadly hanging on a blue wire, poured its dull, yellow light over the entire space of Guy's bachelor kitchen.
Rick sat between Guy and Kines - with a naked torso, holding a faceted glass in his left hand, distractedly listening to Guy's voice.
	 - And he never, - Guy shook his fat forefinger above his head. - He never bragged about his heroic grandfather! But he could. Rick, remember that mess near Khreska's warehouses? He then, almost kicked out of the police, escaped with a reprimand and demotion. And all that was necessary was to go and push, where it should, to the same mayor's office, to download the rights, to connect the press, they say, this is how they treat the honored policemen in our country, and besides, with the grandson of the hero of the Resistance! But Rick, he's not like that. Silently, all silently. For which I appreciate this guy. And what a grandfather! Just imagine, Kai, no, just imagine this - for several hours he defended himself in his police station, killed eleven officers of the White Caste, and he could have left, but he did not want to! This is not a grandfather, this is history! Sklim Yark!
Guy was about to put his hand on Rick's shoulder, but when he saw the bloody bandage, he pulled his hand away, and somehow all sour, he spoke already with sadness, and drunken tears appeared in his bulging eyes:
	 - Rick, I'm sorry. I should have been there today with you. I understand. Friends don't do that.- A transparent drop glistened on the tip of his nose.- I'm really, really sorry for, Rick. Maybe this bullet would be mine …- his full, red face trembled, his voice broke and it was clear that there was not much time left before the sobs of sincere regret. - I would have killed this bastard, I would have killed if I saw him shooting at you! - and, looking at Kines's, spoke to heat. - Kai, I'm the best shooter in our area, I can blow anyone's head from a hundred meters! Ask Rick's - I'm not plowing. Even Captain Cheks from Section 10 is a jerk compared to me.
	 - Chex Houmite?- Kines asked him.
	 - The same one. He's just a puppy at the shooting range, compared to me. I tell you exactly.
	 - Guy of us is the best shooter.- Rick confirmed his words.
	 - But you know what the matter is, - Guy stared at his glass. - I had some difficulty. In clear weather, I shoot almost without looking, but in the rain or, say, at dusk, I don't see a damn thing! But about that, keep quiet, Kai. If Dick finds out, they'll kick me out of the police, that's for sure.
	 - Go to the doctor, - Rick advised him. - I'll ask Laina …
	 - Rick. Are we still friends?
	 - Guy, - Rick, wincing from the pain in his shoulder, patted his friend on the sweaty, hairy hand. - It's okay. There are no dull ones here.
	 - Yes? Are you still my friend?
	 - You know that yourself. Stop it.
	 - Kai is our friend now, he understands everything. This is also fate - from heaven and to the sinful Firmness! Eh, Kai. Just know for sure that Rick and I are your friends, and ... And ... I'll be right back.
Guy Ool pushed himself to his feet, his black leotard stretched out over his knees slid down to reveal the top of his striped shorts.
As he left the kitchen and disappeared into the closet, Kines said, puzzled, looking into Rick's face:
	 - So you are actually the grandson of Sklim Yark's?
	 - Yes.
	 - Hmm. Grandfather is a policeman, you are a policeman. It's in the blood.
	 - Yes, it's in the blood.
They weren't silent for long.
Kines spoke again.
	 - Eleven officers ... Everyone knows this story. He was very lucky, so to speak, Rick. To hold out in the station almost all day, killing almost a dozen specialists ... Fabulous luck. Anyone else would not have been able to.
	 - And he couldn’t,- Rick said these words mechanically, said and regretted it, hesitated and with one firm movement of his hand, knocked the rest of the vodka in his glass into his mouth, the scalding liquid hit his nose.
	 - I.e?
Taking a piece of chopped pickled cucumber from a plate, Rick chewed it for a long time, thought about how to answer Kines' question, then said:
	 - Forget it.
And all.
He sat for some time in silence, listening to the silence that arose, realizing that it was impossible, it was impossible to talk to a friend like a stranger, to wave it off like an annoying fly.
Forget it.
Kines was silent.
	 - You know, Kai, why I said that he could not? Because this is a lie. You yourself are not an amateur in these matters. Those officers were not punks from the street, no one there would have lasted even an hour. Suppose he was able to shoot eleven of them, then how many officers were there at that moment near the station? Twenty? Thirty? So many barrels and more than one well-aimed hit on the target? For many hours of firefight? And the cartridges?
Rick waved his hand, continued:
	 - He was killed. And he ... He just shot back. Well, I finished off a couple of officers, maybe five, and then hardly, and then that's all. These are just official stories, embellished to the point. I do not believe. I don’t believe in eleven corpses, I don’t believe in several hours. This is baloney.
Kines considered what he had heard for a minute, and Rick watched closely for his reaction.
Kines said:
	 - I think you're right. Eleven is overkill.
The tension over the table disappeared, trust and simplicity returned again. Rick smiled, he loved simplicity and he valued trust.
Guy returned.
They poured glasses again and drank and ate. Guy lit a cigarette. Rick too. The ashes from the cigarettes were shaken off into a green saucer.
Outside the dusty window, the dead night hung.



                                          *******                                     *******


	 - And I - believe! I believe! - for greater persuasiveness, Guy banged his fist on the table, hit the saucer-ashtray and she, tumbling and scattering cigarette butts, flew away to the primus that had forgotten its purity, which stood in the corner. Gray ash scattered over a gray tablecloth with large flowers painted on it.- There were they.
Rick was sitting on a chair, moving away from the table and the cigarette in his left hand exuded a bluish, tart smoke.
	 - And the facts?- He chuckled, looking into Guy’s face.- You’re a policeman! Facts where?
	 - Facts? There are facts!
	 - What are the facts?
Kines listened with interest to their conversation, leaning back against the wall - he did not touch the vodka - he quietly drank hot tea from a glass.
Unlike Rick and Guy.
	 - There is no smoke without fire, Rick.
	 - Well, people can talk, they can do different things. Tell us about ghosts.
	 - And it is. But ghosts are different. There were aliens. Exactly.
The sky outside the window was waiting for the early dawn's.
Rick got drunk, he was already hot, his wounded shoulder stopped hurting.
They had been arguing for a long time. They argued about the aliens, which for Guy were a "sore subject", he loved these conversations, loved to prove that half a century ago, guests from outer space visited the Firmness, and it was possible to give various arguments against, but these arguments could not convince him.
And Guy Ool also read cheap newspapers, which were sold in abundance in the same cheap kiosks and, after reading another "stunning" news there, he could tell Rick about aliens, ghosts and other devilry on duty, as tirelessly as a radio box.
	 - Soon I’ll quit drinking and buy myself a telescope.- Guy pushed forward his hairy chest, looked now somewhere over Rick’s head.- I’ll buy a powerful telescope, a large one.
Kines quietly asked Rick:
	 - You still haven't told Guy's why we're here.
	 - Yes? - Guy stared blankly at Kines. - You came to visit me.
	 - Do you have sick leave until what date?
	 - Uh ... Well, three more days. Probably.
Guy hesitantly took up the open bottle of vodka.
	 - I won't,- Kines said.
	 - I’m a little bit,- Rick said, feeling proud of his willpower.
Guy poured himself more than half a glass and it became clear that this would finally knock him down.
	 - I'll come to you tomorrow night. - Rick decided that talking to Guy about Dick's ultimatum is ridiculous.
	 - Rick, anytime. And you Kai, come. Otherwise, I'm all alone here …
And choking on drunken and unexpected tears, Guy Ool drained his glass to the bottom, his Adam's apple, swollen with fat, twitched with every sip.
Together they brought Guy to his crumpled sofa, with a dirty, crumpled sheet, and the same dirty and blackened pillowcase in places, and having laid him down, stood silently, looking at the sleeping man.
	 - Rick …
	 - Let's go to.
Rick went out of the room into the hallway, turned off the light in the room, where Guy disappeared and disappeared in the darkness of loneliness, then went into the kitchen, turned off the light, and took his blood-stained shirt and torn jacket from the back of the chair. Then he began to slowly dress.
Kines was waiting for him in the hallway.
	 - Rick. How did he come to this?
	 - Don't look at him like that. He's different. I knew him differently. He's a good man - Guy Ool. Do you know how long we have been with him in the police together? Twenty four years old. And we grew up together, in the same yard. "Tucking his shirt into his trousers, Rick shook his head." He's a widower. Seven years ago, his wife, Salina, died, his Salina. After each shift he ran home to her, all the talk was about her. And then it was all over. They did not have children. Maybe for the best. Now. Here's a party like that, Kai.
	 - I'll take you home. Morning is coming.
Rick turned abruptly, went into the dark, stinking of tobacco smoke, and, filling a faceted glass with vodka, drank it in one gulp, to the bottom, sat down on a chair and, bowing his head, froze.


                                              *******                                    *******

                                                                  Chapter three.


                                                                      The trip.


The leaves appeared on the trees somehow at once, in one day. That was not, it was not, and suddenly they dressed in foliage - young, bright, green.
It is possible that until today he simply did not notice the signs of a revived spring - business and worries conceal time and attention, as if the rain washes away the day's dust. Rick sat in the driver's seat, driving a police car and involuntarily admired the green poplars growing along the road. The sun was shining brightly, the time was moving towards noon, the window panes of the house on the other side of the roadway sparkled and emitted cheerful, sunbeams on the road, the air smelled of spring, and the day seemed to him just fabulous, even unreal. Rick relaxed, smiling imperceptibly and squinting.
He didn't want to think about work now.
The cigarette in his hand sticking out of the window smoked a blue smoke.
The sounds of the Eastern Orchestra poured from the speaker of the car radio. People walked on the sidewalks, cars passed by, obediently observing the traffic rules, and their drivers stubbornly did not turn their heads in the direction of the police car. About the sidewalk, on the opposite side of the street, with a cheerful, sweeping gait, walked a man of about thirty, average height, without a hat, bald, in gray trousers, cream-colored shoes, and a white shirt, which was decorated with a bright red tie, and this tie of his, literally shone in the bright rays of the sun - catchy, defiant. Rick thought that he himself could probably wear gray trousers and cream-colored shoes, although not likely, but such a red tie - tasteless and catchy - never. That's for sure. It seemed to him that the red tie, the same bad taste as the green hat of Dick School's, which had been presented to him by the wife of the School's, who believed that such a hat, with a red stripe-rim, made Dick's irresistible.
Irresistible.
Irresistible Dick.
Rick chuckled soundlessly. He lit his cigarette, which was about to go out, and looked through the right window of the car.
The spotted, hefty cat rubbed against the trunk of the poplar growing opposite, squinted and stretched, yawned at its full mouth.
	 - I understand you very well, boy, - said Rick and took a drag on his cigarette.
They stopped at the corner of Fourteenth Street, in the heart of Quiet Harbor's sleeping quarters, to stock up on sandwiches and newspapers. Guy still has not returned - he went to the shops and disappeared.
Rick glanced at his wristwatch, half past ten.
Rick glanced at his wristwatch, half past ten.
Ten minutes later, the right door of the passenger compartment, on the passenger side, opened, and Guy tumbled into the car, tossing and turning like a bear - sat down in a chair, lifted his fallen cap off the floor and, putting a large paper bag with groceries on Rick's lap, slammed the door, and began to study the newspapers he had just bought.
Looking into a paper bag - there were paper rolls of sandwiches and two bottles of milk, Rick leaned back and, putting it on the couch of the salon, threw the cigarette butt out the open window, started the engine. The car buzzed with its engine, creaked by the gearbox, and started off along the road.
	 - I say! - Guy cried. - The party "Wind" won in the elections, as much as twelve percent of the vote! How many morons we have, after all. What kind of idiot you have to be to vote for them. My neighbor voted for them, and he is still an idiot.
Rick glanced sideways at his partner, grinned and said:
	 - I voted for them in the last elections.
Guy tactfully remained silent.
	 - Firstly, their leader, I don't remember his name, promised to stir up the antimonopoly committee, was the head of the miners' union, and had no problems with the police.
	 - The last circumstance is, of course, the most important for you.
	 - Not. He loves the Orchestra of Sparks, Guy.
They laughed.
Rick, having reached the intersection, turned onto Northern Avenue, where the railway overpass of the street metro passed over the road - the train was just rumble over them, the shadows of his wagons  flashed on the sidewalk.
Taking a quick glance at the newspaper in Guy's hands, Rick asked:
	 - What do they write about ghosts?
As usual, the partner bought a special kind of cheap rag. Old people and madmen like to read such newspapers.
Rick thought so.
	 - Listen to what they write here …
Rick hardly listened - he was carried away by the music from the radio - the sad composition Solmi Disf, she sang divinely.
	 - ... Researchers of abandoned houses spent the whole night there ... - Guy read with inspiration. - In one of the rooms of the mansion, for no apparent reason, furniture suddenly began to move …
	 - Furniture,- Rick repeated.
He loved days like these. 
The sun, they are driving down the street, Guy reads to him about all the undead, there is order in the station - there are no checks from the police department, for the last day. On their site, no one stabbed anyone.
And, of course, Solmi Disf!
Rick saw her posters on concert posters two years ago, when the singer came to Quiet Harbor on a tour - a prominent lady, pleasant in every way. But she does not compare with his Laina's.
	 - ... Moreover, everyone who was that night in the mansion clearly smelled the smell of burnt wool's …
	 - Wool's.
Rick turned left, they passed the city square, the white building of the city conservatory, with plaster stucco in the form of crossed pipes on the facade, and rolled down the street, where humped noses of harbor cranes protruded above the trees on the right.
Rick remembered how he and Dick had been invited to the police headquarters to receive medals for duty and service.
Dick literally blossomed, looked ten years younger, sang like a nightingale in front of journalists, and before his superiors he thanked, promised, agreed. In general, there was, as they say, "he was at ease." Rick's was handed an envelope with a bonus - a good amount, by the way, it can be taken on a vacation at sea, if Laina arranges a vacation in her hospital so that they can rest together.
In addition, the shoulder, from being wounded by Murlay's bullet, has already healed.
	 - ... According to the professor of biology Fauch Norm, this may well be! After all, we still do not know all the forms of life that live in the ocean, and if we talk about nature and phenomena …
	 - About the phenomena ... Hmm.
Last summer, six months after they met, he and Laina went on vacation to the East Coast.
Rick remembered how at times felt awkward for himself, walking along the embankment next to her, cheerfully, talking about something. Laina, young and fresh as a morning summer breeze, was in a colorful swimsuit, and Rick walked next to her in swimming trunks, shorts, with an already indicated belly and he literally felt with his skin how his age was walking next to him, reminding of himself, and warning.
How much younger is she?
If Laina's is thirty-four, and he is forty-eight …
Not. This is bad arithmetic.
He was afraid to think about it, he was afraid that one day he would see cold indifference in her eyes and understand that everything was over, it was time to leave. Rick again noticed how the familiar fear peeped out from the depths of his soul, the fear of being left without her, of losing her tender, spring light, which is not visible to the eyes, but which his heart saw and knew. To become, like a tramp, thrown out on a cold, alien street, as if to become an unnecessary thing - already a stranger, already burdensome, so that his hateful and empty everyday life stretched out before him again.
Two years ago, Elli left him, for three years of marriage they often quarreled and never became close people. Sometimes people are so different from each other that it is better not to start trying on their opposites with each other.
It so happened that by his age, Rick had not married - the years rushed by in a motley series of events related to his work and fleeting relationships with ladies who did not particularly need him.
But with Laina, it's different.
He can no longer imagine life without her.
Not.
He no longer needs these everyday life without her.
Not needed.
Maybe if Laina agreed to marry him, the thought of a big age difference between them did not weigh him so much, so painful, so scary.
Although marriage will not reverse this age difference. Marriage is not a bridge over an abyss.
“- Laina Dots, how - I love you. I don't need anything without you. "
At forty-eight years old, Rick didn’t expect anything good, and it’s ridiculous to count on something when you cannot run a hundred meters, so that later you don’t suffer from suffocating shortness of breath.
They met her three years ago, at the city hospital, where Guy had brought him wounded in the right leg. The bullet went through the flesh, piercing the calf of the right leg, and without hitting the bone. But there was a lot of blood. Laina operated on him, then Rick spent another week in her department, accepting procedures and rare guests from his area and dying of boredom. He was discharged completely healthy, and a year later, he arrived on a call to the Dots's house.
Rick did not like to remember that evening.
And last winter - cold and fierce, like an angry dog, he again met Laina - in the "Dawn" department store, and on that dull, ordinary day, Rick saw her, saw her and everything in him trembled …
	 - … Moreover, the astronomers of the Mountain Range are confident that at an altitude of seven hundred kilometers from Firmness's, there is an artificial body in a stationary orbit, and at least ten such objects have been seen. Rick can you hear? Ten more!
	 - I hear - ten. Unheard of.
	 - Experts cannot determine the age of these cosmic bodies and how long they have been above the Firmness's. It is possible that these are traces of a long-lost civilization that once lived on our planet. Perhaps hundreds of thousands of years ago! Blimey!
	 - Yes. It's amazing.
	 - Rick, damn you! You did not understand anything.
	 - I understand everything. Hundreds of thousands of years ago.
	 - What - hundreds of thousands of years ago?
Rick pulled up at an intersection overlooking the apartment building, the ground floor of which was occupied by their police station.
	 - The ocean is hundreds of thousands of years old. - Rick said confidently and looked into Guy's face. - They think so.
	 - Ocean? Which ocean?
	 - Which? - Rick took a deep breath. - That ocean, near which the house stands, a mansion. Haunted! I'm listening, Guy. I'm not deaf.
Guy silently buried himself in his newspaper, puffed, his plump face flushed more than usual.
He was offended.
At such moments it is better not to touch it. Let it cool down.
Rick drove the car to the parking lot and thought that there were scoundrels who fool unfortunate people with all sorts of nonsense - about ancient oceans, aliens and mansions where the smell of burning ghosts constantly smells, about all these "hundreds of thousands of years", and people like Guy , read and believe all this, finding in that refuge for themselves, from their life catastrophes.
"- We need to persuade him to meet with a psychiatrist, - thought Rick. - Maybe Laina ask? He listens to her. Although, no. Guy will be immediately kicked out of the police. Better so. And binges do not always happen to him. "


                                          *******                                        *******


                                                                  Chapter four.

                                                             A strange stranger.


Until the end of the working day, Rick hardly left his small office, crammed with cupboards. Cabinets filled with folders and reference books gleamed mattly with gray dust that had settled on their varnished wooden sides. A huge, antique safe, like an iron monster, looked out of the corner of the office, at the very window. Rick's desk, cluttered with papers, stood defiantly in the middle of all this mess, like an old, domineering owner.
Rick finished reading the sheet with the interrogation of witnesses in the next petty theft case, put it in a cardboard folder with shaggy, rag straps and, leaning back in an easy chair, stretched.
A mint, spring wind blew through the wide open window.
And then he remembered something. He picked up the receiver of the telephone.
After a long crackle and noise, a friendly voice of a telephone operator appeared in the receiver:
	 - I listen to you, speak.
	 - Good day. Please connect me to the City Police Department's information desk. 56-87-95.
	 - Wait a minute.
There were loud beeps, after which someone on the other end of the line picked up the phone, and the disgruntled voice of Sergeant Tolpi Hwai grumbled:
	 - City Police Archive, Sergeant Tolpi Hwai. I'm listening.
	 - Hi, Tol. This is Rick.
	 - What other Rick?
	 - Are you deaf? Do you forget old friends?
	 - Friends don't drink so much. Especially Guy.
Rick laughed.
	 - Tol, I need one reference.
	 - Well.
	 - I need a car owner.
	 - Dictate. But my friend, I'll tell you right away, the result will have to wait.
	 - I'm not hurrying. The car is a "Bully" red, new model, number AE 380. I don’t know the last figure.
	 - What have you got on him?
	 - Just a check. I'll call you tomorrow night.
	 - Do not. I know its owner. There are only four such cars in the city. The AE number only starts with one. It belongs to the mayor's nephew. I don't remember his name. Either Tolpi or Mei. I'll see.
	 - Thank you, Tol. You are a phenomenon.
	 - Bye, Rick.
Glancing at his watch, he got to his feet and, leaving the office, examined the "Corral".
Those who worked in the station called "Corral" a spacious hall filled with tables and filing cabinets. Three large windows on the opposite wall were barred, and many tables were empty. Dust, light as smoke, hung in the air, glowing in the sun by the windows like a golden curtain. It smelled of old books and sweaty socks.
In the "Corral" there were now three - Guy Ool, at the central window, Abrom Chloe - wiry blond, thirty-seven years old, with a defiant wart on the tip of his nose.
In the corner, where there was a common, green safe, sat at his table his own, the younger brother of Guy's, Frou Ool - he was thirty-eight years old, a broad-shouldered, handsome, dark-haired man, with wide cheekbones and a small, strong-willed mouth. Unlike his brother, Frou was not noticed in drunkenness, and even at rare parties he always managed to stay sober. Probably, this made his wife, Ney, very happy.
Rick walked around a couple of empty tables, and going up to Abrom Chloe, looked at the papers, over which he pored.
	 - Are you finishing this case?
	 - Almost finished. Autopsy results and interviews of witnesses ... You can take it to court. The suspect's lawyer came …
	 - Shit on him, not a deal with the investigation!- Rick snorted.- He should have confessed right away. Finish and go home. - He looked at Guy, then at Fru. - I- left. Frou, are you on duty today?
	 - I.
	 - Dick didn't show up?
	 - Didn't even call.
" Did not call".
	 - Okay. Everyone, see you tomorrow. Till tomorrow.
At the entrance to the station, there were three police cars. In one of them, with the driver's side door open and his foot out on the asphalt, sat a young freckled lieutenant Mirrol Dar.
Frou Oola's partner.
Mirrol constantly chewed something, and now, putting a sheet of paper on the steering wheel and reading what was written in it, moved his jaws - in his raised hand, he was holding a bitten bagel.
	 - Until tomorrow, - Rick passing by, waved his hand.
	 - Boo, - answered Mirrol Dar.
The bus stop was behind the intersection, near the flower shop. Walking along the sidewalk, Rick stopped at a pedestrian crossing, waiting for his green light at the traffic light, lit a cigarette.
Nice evening.
And it's warm like summer't.
Even starting to sweat, Rick did not unbutton his jacket, endured. Guy, of course, was never embarrassed by such trifles, he always walked unbuttoned, sticking out his sweaty belly, covered with a shirt.
Rick chuckled, blew out smoke, and walked across the road to the bus stop.
The workday is over.
While waiting for his bus, Rick thought that it was possible to walk to the metro station, then the way home would be cut in half, but he did not want to go to the station, it was far.
The bus approached quickly, the cabin was full of empty seats, although the "rush hour" had already come - Rick walked to the end of the cabin and sat by the window, began to look at the street.
He did not notice her - the woman sat down next to him quietly, and asked not loudly:
	 - Are you Rickslem Yark?
	 - I.
He looked at her.
She was probably the same age as him, dressed in a white blouse and a long, blue in flowers, skirt, hair, black and thick, pulled back in an intricate knot.
The woman had a long, pale face and black, large, attentive eyes.
	 - You do not know me, I will not introduce myself. Believe me, this is useless, - the woman with an imperceptible movement of her right hand thrust something small and cold into Rick's palm. - This is the key to the locker at the railway station. There lies what belonged to my grandmother's.
	 - One minute that you …
	 - I am coming now. Listen, don't give this to anyone. However, as you wish. That's your business. There is something that once belonged to your grandfather, Sklim Yark. Cell number 135, code L 7890. L-azure. 7890. Simple cipher. Will you remember?
	 - How do you know...
	 - Will you memorize the code or will you write it down?- A small brown leather purse appeared in her hands.- I'll write to you.
	 - I'll remember. L 7890. Simple.
	 - I have no one to give it to. Now it's up to you to decide. You are very much like your grandfather, Rickslame. Almost one face. Fate.
She quickly got to her feet and walked down the aisle, past the seats, to the exit.
The bus sighed with the brakes and froze at the stop.
	 - Fifteenth Street,- the driver announced.
Rick sat and watched as his sudden interlocutor stepped off the footboard and walked quickly down the sidewalk, her white blouse shining brightly against the backdrop of the marbled, gray building.
Several people entered the bus at once and the doors closed.
Rick looked at the stranger until she disappeared from view.
He was at home in an hour.


                                                *******                                      *******


The sun was already sinking, it hung over the tops of the distant forest, where a little in the distance the new stadium sparkled with a bright red ring of a galvanized roof. The transparent evening sky promised coolness.
Rick was sitting at the kitchen table and his large, half-liter, aluminum mug was steaming with hot tea.
Laina's apartment had five rooms, large and bright. He lived here, in these mansions with her, leaving his pitiful one-room "hole" to gather dust and spiders. 
At first, Rick rented out his apartment to tenants, but after the flood, which the last tenants arranged, flooding the neighbors on the floor below, he stopped renting it and went there, only for rare drinking with colleagues. 
He changed into his casual tracksuit, sat on a chair with his legs crossed and looked out the window.
A saucepan of dumplings was boiling on the gas stove, and the delicious spirit of the family hearth, satiety and a call to rest on the sofa in the living room swept through the kitchen.
The key, handed to him by a stranger on the bus, glittered next to a mug on the table.
Rick got to his feet, walked over to the stove and, turning down the gas, headed for the door.
He didn't even look at the key.
The daily watch in the hospital will end at Laina in the morning, and he will not see her until he leaves for work.
Going out onto the balcony, and leaning his elbows on the wooden, lacquered railing, Rick lit a cigarette, threw an extinguished match into a heavy, glass ashtray that stood on a round polished table, and wrapped himself in tobacco smoke.
Below, a guy and a girl were jogging along the asphalt, curving like a snake, dusty path. Their poodle, defiantly urinating on a lamppost, rushed to catch up with them.
There was almost no wind.
The sun setting over the horizon shone in Rick's eyes.
	 - I don’t know anything,- he said aloud.
What does he really know about his grandfather?
Nothing.
He was a policeman during the time of the White Castes, rose to the rank of lieutenant, almost retired.
Killed at his police station.
Hero of the Resistance.
The woman who gave him the key said that Rick is very similar to his grandfather, and that is why he decided to consider her crazy.
Firstly, he saw portraits of his grandfather Sklim's - one of them hangs in the lobby of the main police department of Quiet Harbor, and Rick did not notice the similarities between himself and his grandfather in the portrait. And secondly, the woman was about fifty years old, maybe a little less, and the second civil war ended fifty years ago. His grandfather was killed even before she was born, and this woman could not know and see Sklim's Yark to compare them with Rick.
He smoked, looking in front of him, the ashes flew away in gray flakes.
Rick did not remember his father well, he died when Rick's was barely five years old. Mother knew almost nothing about Rick's grandfather, and his father did not have any things that belonged to his father, Sklim's Yark.
No matter how strange it was, Rick's life turned out in such a way that he knew only what was said in the official version about his grandfather.
He stubbed out a cigarette in the ashtray, went out into the living room, and headed for the kitchen.
The dumplings were boiling, steam from the pan poured in a wide column.
Rick used a spoon to catch dumplings from the pan, put them on a plate, sat down at the table and began to eat.
He had never heard of madmen chasing after someone to "convey something from their distant ancestors." As far as Rick's knows, madmen had a weakness to use fictitious names, usually names of celebrities, but also pretended to be military or police officers.
However, Rick was not a psychiatrist. He had enough of his problems.
And no crazy people.
The key lay before him like a steel temptation.
	 - Hmm.
He finished eating, got up and washed the plate, put it in the cabinet, next to her brothers, looked at the pan - no, he won't wash it now. Later.
So what does he lose if he goes to the station and checks the words of that woman?
	 - Nothing.
Except for time.
The dumplings in his stomach were protesting against the idea of going somewhere now.
	 - Okay.
Having uttered this word out loud, Rick went into the bedroom, where his police holster hung on a hook in the closet, took out a heavy, army pistol from it, took out a cardboard box with cartridges from the shelf, loaded.
Twelve yellow, blunt rounds took their places in the drum.
Se Lok 45 — Twelve Powerful Arguments.
Putting his shoes on and putting his black hat on his head, Rick left the apartment.
The lock on the door clicked softly behind him.


                                              *******                                     *******


                                                                    Chapter five.


                                                                      Notebook.


Rick returned home closer to eleven o'clock in the evening.
A taxi drove him from the station, there was no shooting or pursuit.
On the way to the station, he strayed like a lascivious hare - rode several stations on the metro, changing trains, entered large shops with walkways three times, and even nearly lost his hat, climbing over a brick fence in some smelly gateway's.
At the station, he walked for a long time near the cash desks, pretending that he was going to go somewhere. And only deciding that there was no "tail" behind him, Rick went to the storage rooms and, opening the cell he needed, took out of it a stupid, rag bag - black with a blue strip. The edges of the bag were frayed.
With such shabby bags, devoid of shape and appearance, the ubiquitous old women go shopping.
In the bag lay a wide, flat bundle - either a book or a notebook.
Rick didn’t look at what was wrapped in rough wrapping paper right away.
And now, having entered home, he closed the front door, threw a security chain over it and, turning on the electric light, went through all the rooms.
There was no one in the apartment except him.
Rick threw the bag with the package on the sofa in the living room, went into the kitchen and made himself a mug of hot tea, and only then he returned to the living room, put the mug of tea on the mahogany coffee table, lay down on the sofa and began to study the package.
Under the simple wrapping paper used to wrap groceries in any store was a thick, cardboard-covered notebook.
No writing on the cover, just yellowed spots and ink marks.
Before the first page, a pencil, black-and-white drawing was inserted into the notebook, two young people were depicted on it - a boy and a girl. A guy dressed in some kind of uniform looked from a sheet of paper with friendly big eyes, on his head Rick unmistakably recognized a police cap of old years.
Such caps - angular, with the edges bent down, no one has seen in fifty years. He once visited the police museum, and there, in the glass showcases, displayed for all to see, there were samples of uniforms from different years. The cap shown in the picture was worn by a police officer at least half a century ago, back in the days of the White Castes.
The guy in the picture was very similar to the young Rick's - the same wide cheekbones, the shape of the nose and lips, the same curvature of the eyebrows.
The girl looked stern and cold. Her short bangs hid her eyebrows, the dress of an incomprehensible cut was baggy on her, and a string of necklace was visible on her thin neck.
It was Rick's grandparents.
He did not doubt it for a second.
Rick recognized his grandmother right away - her early drawings were still preserved during his childhood, lost afterwards, like many of the antiques.
Rick smiled as he looked at the drawing, well worn on thick old paper.
He carefully put the portrait aside and found another underneath. On a sheet of paper was a young guy with a round, pleasant face. Above the drawing was the inscription in bold block letters:
“A particularly dangerous criminal! Search. If the above person is found, you should immediately inform the nearest office of the Department of Justice or Inquiry. Self-detention of the specified person or such an attempt is equivalent to high treason and is punishable by imprisonment, up to life! The remuneration is guaranteed. "
He once again examined the drawing - an ordinary face, does not look like a criminal, although, who can look like a criminal?
But the accompanying inscription on the drawing puzzled Rick's. How important should the wanted person be so that for his independent arrest the police will face life imprisonment?
However, in the days of the Castes, this was not something special.
Under this drawing there were two more - on one girl of about twenty-five, it was clear that the artist was trying, he even managed to convey the light tone of her hair, pretty, her nose was strewn with freckles.
The drawing of the second guy was rubbed, his torso was poorly visible, only his face, wide, with large, dark eyes, was well preserved.
All three drawings were signed with a formidable inscription.
Especially dangerous criminals.
How old are these drawings? Fifty years? Sixty? More less?
Rick didn't know.
Putting all four drawings aside, carefully, as if fearing that they might crumble from his touch to dust, Rick began to study the contents of the notebook itself.
The first thing he saw was a sheet, once white paper, but now faded and yellowed with age, covered with large, hurried handwriting. The sheet was pasted on by someone, on top of the sheets of the notebook itself, yellow streaks of glue and a neatly cut edge are still visible.
He read:
“My dear, Umma.
For many years I have kept this notebook as a memory of the events and people that were in my life, incredible if you look at them from the outside, but for me they have always been and will remain real, like my life itself.
I mean aliens.
This is not the invention of fools. They really were in Firmness's and flew away somewhere further, into space, at least I very much hope that they managed to do this, despite the dangers that accompanied them here.
Umma, my granddaughter, do not think that your grandmother is out of her mind. You know me, be sane and trust me. One of the aliens lived in my apartment, in your father's room. He was brought to me by my colleague, Dr. Evol. Do you remember him. You must remember him. I went to forgery to save the alien, and passed him off as my nephew, Rouke. So he lived under the name Rouke Wack. His real name is Sergei Senchin.
And there was also Sveta.
Svetlana Lanina.
Most likely she died.
The third was Misha. Mikhail Gorin.
I write their names to you because I want you to remember them and then, when the time comes, pass them on to your children. Over time, I became sentimental, it seems to me that as long as their names sound, they will live. I really want them to find their Peaceful shores that they dreamed of.
They fled before the start of the first civil war, the price of human life then cost nothing. They were helped by two good people. Without them, it would be impossible for the aliens to escape. Inquiry Officer Major Folk Stoke and Police Sub-Lieutenant Sklim Yark.
What happened to Folk then, I don't know, I never met him again.
Sklim was killed in a police station, he was shot during his arrest, but before his death he managed to shoot two officers of inquiry. He did not give up, did not want to.
I leave his portrait to you, keep it, as I have kept all these years. He left it to me as a keepsake - he was going to fly away with the aliens, but he could not.
Umma, this notebook is Sergei's diary. I don't know what he wrote about in it. But let it be with you, as a part of those days that have changed more than one life.
Your grandmother is Tosya. "
Rick re-read what he had written again, then thoughtfully, looked for a long time at the colored wallpaper on the wall.
"He was going to fly away."
The official version of his grandfather's death was popping at all the seams.
"They were helped by two good people."
They helped.
Rick turned over the insert page, covered by "Grandma Tosya."
The scent of dust and old age emanated from the faded pages of the notebook.
Wrote with an old fountain pen, blue ink, smooth, large handwriting, but such letters, Rick had never met before, like a first grader in the first lesson, he looked at the lines of other people's letters, not understanding what was written.
The text went in separate paragraphs of different sizes, in some places dirty, ink blots loomed.
“... Why rush the inevitable? I don't care if I die someday. But if there is even the slightest hope for a meeting, then you have to wait and endure. That day we ran away from them in different directions, hid in the forest. They could not catch everyone. They didn't catch me! ... "
Rick flipped through page after page - no drawings, only unfamiliar words.
“... If I’m gone, then the only hope to fly away from here is knowing the access code to the“ Wanderer's ”systems. Maybe this notebook will fall into our hands, then they will have a chance to be saved.
There is no way to contact the ship. I don’t know how to deal with it.
Guys, if you are reading these lines, then I am no longer there. Spit. I want you to be able to fly away from this cursed Firmness.
Starship systems access code:
7793159605 Ash.
I don’t know how you will be able to communicate with the onboard computer, but that should help you. If I'm gone, then ... "
He leafed through the notebook, peered at the text incomprehensible to him, and involuntarily felt the feeling as if he had touched something otherworldly, as if a ghost suddenly appeared and disappeared in front of him.
“I will definitely quit drinking. I'm giving it up. You can't go on like this, I turned into a pig. Yesterday I slept behind the sheds in the yard. Some bastard ripped out all my pockets. Reptiles. The world of reptiles. And I'm a bastard ... "
"Whore! A whore and a thief! And I wanted to marry her. Fool. A hundred times a fool. She left and took away the gramophone. It's a shame in front of Aunt Tosya, it was her gramophone, but now, what? What will I tell her? That the slut robbed me? It's a shame. At least die.
Aunt Tosya doesn't know about it yet. I'll buy her a new gramophone. I will save up and buy.  Must stop drinking. I'll give it up tomorrow. Exactly, I decided! ... "
“... I got drunk like a pig. What for?
Life is shit ... "
“... It's just winter now. I looked up at the sky. He burst into tears like a slobber. The stars are like lights. I still believe in them, they are, these Peaceful Shores. Must be. I don't want to know myself like that, I have to stop. I can't think of anything at all ... "
“... Every spring like that. It's like life starts anew. You walk down the street and smile like a fool. Okay. And also this spring smell, when the first greenery appears. So it was on Earth. I remember her. I still remember our Earth ... "
On the penultimate page, the alien wrote in large, incomprehensible letters:
“Svetka was found!
Sveta Lanina was found !!! Now I am awake. I will become different. Now we are together. Fate..."
“... Svetka, my wonderful Svetka. I will burn everything here to the ground ... "
Then came the last paragraph:
“Misha, well done! I knew he was tenacious, son of a bitch! Now we will fly away from here. Everything.
Folk, of course, is still a type, but he needs to start all over again.
Evol will take a break from his ulcer.
Sklim funny.
From the outside, we are all funny.
But we'll be lucky! "
And all.
Not a single word was written further. The last sheet of the notebook was blank.
Rick turned the pages in reverse order - looked at other people's letters, inhaled the smell of the decay of the past years.
Finally he closed the notebook, and for a long time looked at her with a frozen gaze, as if he had seen her for the first time.
"They were helped ..."
"He was going to fly away."
Sklim Yark, a hero of the Resistance, his own grandfather, was killed for knowing aliens. And he wanted to fly away with them.
No underground, no Resistance. He was an ordinary cop, just like Rick.
The time passed well after midnight, and the sounds of cars passing along the street became rare, he did not hear their beeps - the city plunged into sleep.
Rick didn't know what to do with this old notebook now. Hide the notebook here at Laina's house? Or take it to your apartment?
This is dangerous.
Judging by the nervous state of that woman, the owner of the notebook, and by her very act, it turned out that someone was hunting her. Someone really needs this notebook and what is in it.
	 - Of course.- Rick spoke these words out loud and, looking at a stack of folded sheets of drawings, he found the one on which his grandfather was depicted.
From a yellowed, rough sheet of thick paper, the face of a young policeman, in a cap and a dark shirt, with well-drawn shoulder straps, looked at him.
His own face …


                                              *******                                   *******

                                                                    Chapter six.


                                                                      Guy Ool.



Rick stopped the car at an intersection and, waiting for the green light, drummed with the fingers of his right hand on the grooved surface of the steering wheel.
Time was approaching lunchtime.
He loved this time of day.
Looking at the pedestrians exhausted from the heat, rushing across the road, at the tremor of the air over the asphalt heated by the Sun, without turning his head, Rick asked Guy's:
	 - And how are you at your forty-five years?
	 - Nohow. This is flourishing for a woman, and I - here! - Guy displeasedly patted himself on the belly, covered with a blue, uniform shirt, with dark spots of sweat, blew his nose loudly through the open car window, and wiped his nose with his sleeve, then wiped his sleeve on his trouser leg. I understood these stupid people who rejoice in all kinds of anniversaries there. What's good about them? Well, you became even closer to your grave board. What to be happy about?
Rick looked at Guy, a red, full face drenched in large beads of sweat that trickled down his bull's neck and wet the collar of his shirt.
	 - Look at it easier.
	 - And how should I look at it?
	 - Easier. Like me.
	 - Anniversary, Guy, this is not a counter of the years gone by.
	 - What do you think is this, if not a counter? Thinks like a taxi.
	 - This is an incentive for new, even more amazing accomplishments, - and Rick laughed merrily, looking as Guy's face, already red from the heat, turns even more red and becomes almost crimson. - Forty-five for a man is the heyday!
	 - Yeah. That is, I can barely fit into my pants - I bloomed!
	 - You're juicy, Guy.
	 - Yeah. I became juicy.
	 - Like a tomato.
Guy finally laughed, a hoarse, low laugh, his bulging chest shaking.
From behind there were the impatient horns of car horns, Rick stuck his head out the window and shouted cheerfully:
	 - Who is impatient to receive a fine?
He put in first gear, and the car smoothly moved forward, picking up speed, rushed through the intersection.
Guy was still laughing.
Shaking his dark head, Guy Ool took out a large white handkerchief from his sagging chest pocket, soaked with sweat, wiped his face and neck with it, and crumpled it back into his pocket.
Rick slowly lit a cigarette.
They drove through the entire Fourth North Street, past the Sunny Boulevard buried in green trees, where you can always see cyclists and young people walking along the paths. The voice of some announcer sounded from the radio.
Rick didn't listen.
Guy's birthday today.
Guy is forty-five years old today.
A few minutes later they stopped at the site in front of the police station, Rick turned off the engine, got out of the car and waited for his partner - he watched Guy, with a harsh grunt, get out of the car into the sunlight. Together they climbed the concrete steps of the wide porch and entered the lobby.
Duk Schopeller, a forty-year-old, tall and completely bald expert, came out to meet them, he carried a thick leather folder in his hands, a black case with a camera was dangling on his chest on the straps.
	 - Here you are, Rick!- Duk glanced at Guy, said hastily, holding out his hand.-Guy, congratulations - all the best, be a fine fellow.
	 - Thank you.
	 - Rick, I'm at the office, I'll be there in two hours. Did you send the papers on the Grims case?
	 - Two days ago.
	 - Damn them, they called from the department, asked for a report, and …
	 - Duk, this is no longer our concern, let them search. I do not intend to write a new report.
	 - This is all the new secretary of the chief, smart as a brick, but she has boobs! - Duk Schopeller showed what kind of boobs she has. - Guy, come to me after the shift today.
	 - What is this for?
	 - I'll check your blood pressure, you look bad for a birthday boy. Rick, put your friend aside, I'm afraid his stroke will hit him, red as cancer.
	 - Don't croak, crow. - Guy belly pushed the expert out of his way.- I'll come in.
Rick wiggled his nose suspiciously, asked Duk's, who was standing in the doorway:
	 - And what does it stink with?
	 - Vomited. Mirol dragged the tippler's- still young, he is diligent. That's it, I'm gone. Say hello to the boss?
	 - Not worth it. Watch out for the secretary's tits, don't get caught.
Rick followed Guy into the "Corral".
They were greeted.
More precisely, everyone was waiting for Guy.
In front of everyone stood Guy's brother, Fru Ool, a tall, broad-shouldered brunette with a narrow, tanned face.
Along the low wooden partition, dividing the "Corral" into a working area and a corridor, stood Abrom Khloi, of medium height, lean, wiry blond, somewhat like a mongrel mongrel, and Mirol Dar.
Rick saw the door opposite the captain's office open, and Dick School came out.
	 - Guy, - Frou began to say. - Happy birthday to you.
	 - Congratulations,- said Abrom.
	 - Congratulations, - this is Morol.
Two sergeants entered the "Corral".
Everyone crowded around Guy, clapping him on the shoulder, shaking his hand.
The captain pushed his way to the birthday boy and, shaking his hand, said:
	 - Guy, I wish you a happy birthday. With all the ... uh-uh, rough edges, you are an excellent police officer and a reliable partner. We have been together for many years …
Rick listened to Dick's speech. He spoke for a long time and it seemed that he was sincere, and about "successes in the past and the future", and about "wishes for good health." The final part of his speech, Dick summed up, that "our friendly and close-knit team is glad to have such a nice guy like Guy in our ranks." Dick finished with a wish to the birthday man "to get rid of the bad habit as soon as possible." At the same time, the captain winked slyly at him with his right eye, and smiled like a father.
	 - And more! - Dick turned to Frou, asked conspiratorially. - Have you brought?
	 - Yes.
	 - Well, where?
Frou pointed to the far corner of the "corral's", to a plywood box at the desk. The box was huge, it stood upright, like a pencil case, and reached the height of a man's height.
	 - Aha. - Dick again turned to Guy's. - Guy, the guys and I decided here that you can't go without a present.
	 - Thank you.- Guy smiled, but in his eyes turned to the strange box, suspicion was read.
	 - We want you to finally be able to find your ghosts, - Dick laughed loudly and kindly. - And we will give you on this momentous day ... However, go and see for yourself. There he stands, your gift.
And Guy went to look.
He moved uncertainly, as if afraid to frighten off a bird - he walked around the partition and, passing the desks, stopped in front of the box, motionlessly looking at the colored label glued to its plywood side.
All were silent.
Guy froze.For a long minute he studied the label, hesitantly touched the box with his hands, then turned, and Rick saw his face twitch:
	 - This is a telescope. - Guy almost whispered these words and again looked at the box. - A telescope! Big!
	 - Mirol. - Dick turned to the young policeman's. - You went to get this thing. Show Guy how and what.
Mirol hurried to Guy's to help, before reaching him, he already began to speak in a businesslike manner, with knowledge of the matter:
	 - Powerful device! And great optics. I personally checked everything, there is a fine pickup, adjustment screws …
Then, when Rick and Guy were driving to interview witnesses to the robbed apartment, Guy was silent for a long time, looking somewhere outside the window, then he spoke:
	 - Only you knew I wanted to buy a telescope, Rick.
	 - Guy, the guys were sincerely happy that they can give you your dream. Mirol busied himself most of all, he went to the department store, looked in the catalog, then, when the package arrived, he went to check if everything was in order there. Although he is still green, but the guy that you need. You would growl less at him, or something.
	 - Rick, I ... - Guy stopped short. - It's a lot of money!
	 - We collected everything for a gift, Guy. This is rare. Happy anniversary to you, friend.
	 - They collected everything ... I did not expect this from Dick's. Thanks, Rick. You have no idea what this means to me.
Rick glanced at him briefly, said:
	 - I can imagine, Guy. You are a real friend and a good guy, everyone loves you.
	 - I did not expect. This is a cosmic gift. I thought it would be some kind of cheap shaving kit. Rick, I'm fucking uncomfortable in front of the guys - it's an expensive thing and …
	 - Forget it. We're all happy for you, Guy.
Rick did not tell him that he and Fru Ool paid the lion's share of the "cosmic gift". The other guys from their police station also spent a lot on it. And only Dick School did not want to spend money on a gift to Guy's.
He didn't give a penny.


                                            *******                                        *******


                                                                   Chapter seven.

                                                                          Laina.

White, painted with oil paint, the door leading to the bathroom opened, and Laina came out of it - in a light, chintz robe, with cheeks flushed from a hot shower, in pink velvet slippers and a red terry towel wrapped around her head.
The shower room smelled of warmth, dampness and the smell of scented soap.
He was standing in the hallway, in front of a large, high mirror, next to the dressing table — brushing his black dress shoes with a shoebrush. His fingers were black with black shoe polish.
Laina stopped behind him, put her hands on Rick's shoulders, and asked:
	 - Are you brushing your feathers, Inspector?
	 - Uh-huh.
	 - Are they still not shiny enough?
	 - Not enough.
	 - You’ll wipe a hole in them.
	 - I don’t want to look like a vagabond next to you. We are going to the birthday, there will be all of ours. - Rick meticulously examined the shoe from all sides, then turned his gaze to the reflection of Laina in the mirror.- First, I'll rub my shoes, - he turned to face her, hugged Laina's around the waist, taking his palms soiled in black cream to the sides. - Then you.
	 - You are a pedant. - She kissed him on the nose. - Everything should shine.
	 - You're beautiful.
	 - Thank you.
	 - After the party at Abrom's, Dick talked only about you for a week.
	 - And about the bandits?
	 - He forgot about them. His wife was extremely unhappy.
	 - He never got a chance, dear.
	 - You just did not see him, in his favorite green hat.
	 - Does he have a green hat?- Laina's voice grew languid.
	 - With a red ribbon.
	 - With a red ribbon? Are you kidding!
	 - With red. Pimps like to wear these hats. But his wife finds him, irresistible.
	 - You're a boor, Rick.
	 - It's not my hat!
	 - Again I have to listen to your scary stories.
	 - But I went with you to the name day of your chief physician.
	 - So what?
	 - I have suffered horror.
Laina laughed, throwing her head back, her white teeth flashing whiteness. She kissed him on the cheek and said in Rick's ear:
	 - You haven't listened to our pathologist's yet.
	 - I've had enough of you and Jax's. Which is wearing glasses.
	 - With glasses - Mori Zhesk.
	 - It doesn't matter who it is. I was very much afraid.
	 - What scared you so much, dear?
	 - I was worried that you would remove my appendicitis. You were all very drunk there. And your chief doctor is a terrible person. It seems to me that he is not entirely healthy.
He looked at her face - on Laina's slightly snub nose small beads of sweat glittered, wet eyelashes stuck together and seemed to become longer and blacker than usual, her brown eyes looked at him with warmth in her gaze.
Holding Laina's close to him, Rick felt under her full breasts, the beating of her heart, inhaled the scent of flowers emanating from her.
He saw her light - the light of spring.
At such moments, everything inside Rick froze, his feelings sharpened - something invisible, something that was impossible to see, to see with his eyes, became visible to the eyes of his heart.
He called it spring light.
Spring light.
Around Laina's, it was as if a golden, warm glow appeared - a gentle, dear one, which happens in early spring, when awakening and life comes to the Firmness, like the shine of the sun from behind a fleeing cloud. He looked at her, with a sinking heart, was ready to stand like this, next to her, for an infinitely long time, when time lost its meaning.
He believed that she also saw his light, his feelings, his love.
They stood there for a while, chatting about various nonsense, then Laina glanced at the round clock hanging on the wall, and the nonsense ended, her face assumed a businesslike expression.
Kissing Rick on the lips, she gently pulled back and said:
	 - Rick, I'll show you something.- She walked down the corridor to the living room door, and returned a minute later, carrying a small black and blue box in her right hand.
	 - What's this? Potion?
	 - It's a very good and very expensive cologne, Rick. I chose it for a long time.- Her voice sounded serious, as if she was telling Rick's his diagnosis.- You’ll give it to Guy. From U.S.
Rick took the box from her hand. On its "obverse" side in gold, block letters was written - "night charm".
Rick sniffed the box.
	 - Smells good.
	 - He'll love it.
	 - Where such confidence?
	 - Rick, he lives alone, he will be pleased that they take care of him. Your friends don’t give anything except socks and cognac.
	 - Guy won't like it.
	 - Rick!
	 - What?
	 - This is a wonderful gift.
	 - But not for him.
	 - Rickslame!- Laina said his full name in an emphatically cold tone.
	 - I'm telling you for sure. He won't like it.
	 - Then explain to me.
	 - Guy is obese. He sweats. He'll think it's a hint. A hint that he smells like sweat. Giving him a cologne is like calling Guy's "stinky. He won't be happy.
Rick saw that Laina was upset.
Looking at him, she said:
	 - Rickslame Yark, you stink, and I want this cologne to be always at your fingertips! - Laina turned away, she walked down the corridor, and Rick watched her thighs move under the robe. - Rick, get ready. We leave in half an hour.
	 - We have two more hours.
	 - We'll go to the store. You will give Guy's a shirt. Won't he consider such a gift a hint? I do not understand your suspiciousness.
	 - Shirt?- Rick looked down at the cologne package he was holding in his right hand - it had black marks of cream on it from his soiled fingers.- I don't think he will be offended by the shirt.
	 - What if he decides that he looks like a ragamuffin? - she went out into the corridor, carrying in her hand a black ribbon of a bow tie. - And take off that stupid tie, Rick.
	 - He bowed his head, looked at his tie - still new, black with gray stripes, quite decent.
	 - He's excellent.
	 - Here. - Laina stood beside him, holding out his tie: - Just wash your hands.
	 - Never! "Butterfly"! I hate them.
She kissed him on the lips, said:
	 - Rick, for my sake, dear, - her hands were already untiing the tie around Rick's neck, the collar of his white shirt was pulled up.
	 - Clowns and pimps wear bow ties.
	 - Probably, your Dick also has the same tie. To the green hat.
	 - You’ll turn me into God knows what.
	 - Rickslem, without this butterfly you will look like a vagabond. Pimps look more solid.
	 - With a "butterfly".
	 - With a "butterfly".
Looking into her dark, big eyes, Rick suddenly wondered how Laina would react if he showed her the alien's notebook?
In about forty minutes they left the apartment and took the elevator down to the first floor. Laina's house, which was built just three years ago, had an lifter's with a control panel, and it did not have the usual elevator in green uniform and the same cap.
In the parking lot, in the courtyard of the house, going up to Laina's car, Rick asked:
	 - Will you drive the car?
	 - Am I in heels?
	 - You are always in heels.
	 - These are very high heels, dear.
The sequins on her light, crimson sleeveless dress glittered piercingly in the sun, they shimmered from bright yellow to deep violet, and her high heels of white shoes knocked out the measured thud that carried through the yard from the paving slabs. The white feather of the rim on Laina's head swayed and quivered with every step she took.
Rick opened the driver's door and got behind the steering wheel.
An elderly gatekeeper with a wide, toothless smile, in a blue, uniform suit, opened the gate in front of their car - he literally glowed with happiness, looking at Laina's, sitting next to Rick.
	 - All the best to you, madam.
	 - Thank you. Have a good evening too.
Rick drove the car out onto the carriageway, turned right.
	 - He hates me,- Rick said with a grin.
	 - It's jealousy, Inspector.
The sun was bright and hot, blazing on the chrome headlight attached to the fender of the car on the driver's side, forcing Rick's to squint.



                                              *******                                    *******


The Ool family lived in a two-story red brick mansion, built in the days of the White castes, massive and solid, with a gable roof, once covered with clay tiles, and recently replaced with tin. The windows in the house were large and light, and the front porch was wide, fenced with wooden, varnished railings, stretching along its entire eastern wall, from corner to corner.
In front of the house there was a spacious lawn, more like a football field, a stone fountain with the figure of a plaster mermaid and several tall, old, like this house itself, branchy trees, tired of their years.
The plot, on which the house and everything that belonged to it, was located, was fenced by a high wall, laid out of rubble stone, overgrown with moss and wild ivy.
This house was inherited by the wife of Fru Oola-Nee, from her uncle, who died twenty years ago, and together with the house she inherited his typewriting bureau "At the Origins", where about fifty typists worked, several ateliers for sewing women's clothing, scattered throughout the city, and an old, dilapidated yacht - without sails, with a damaged bottom, which was not repaired, but was paid annually for its berth at the city yacht club, in the north of Quiet Harbor.
The day had long passed through noon - the sun had reduced its heat, but the calm air was still stuffy. Above a wide flower bed, broken under a stone wall, where a cool shadow now grew, midges scurried, and a fat, hulking bumblebee persistently rummaged in one of the red flowers, sticking out its plump, striped bottom.
The stone bowl of the fountain stood empty, without water, the plaster mermaid shone in the sun with a smooth belly and incredibly sharp breasts.
Everyone was gathered around a long white tablecloth table that stood between the west side of the mansion and an old maple tree with a broken, drying branch.
In a wide, iron brazier, right under the maple, sausages were being cooked, blue smoke poured, the smell of the sausages was delicious.
Rick, Abrom and Kines stood at the brazier - Kines watched the sausages being cooked, Abrom chewed a ham sandwich and tried to tell Rick's a new, vulgar joke.
Guy, brightly lit by the rays of the sun, in huge blue shorts and a white shirt, stuck out on the lawn. He was assembling a tripod for his telescope, and Mirol, who was standing next to him, respectfully advised him something. Frou's son, nine-year-old Reeves, black-haired, with serious, black eyes, barefoot, dressed in beige trousers and a matching T-shirt, was spinning beside them. His sneakers lay next to the telescope box. Abrom's son- Chems, was a blond, agile, ten-year-old boy, dressed in blue shorts and a yellow T-shirt, waged a continuous and sullen struggle with Reeves for the right to stand closer to the spyglass. The boys from time to time silently, surreptitiously, nudged their elbows and whispered something in each other's ear.
Everyone, except for Abrom Chloe's, had already drunk a "starting glass", but the table had not been laid yet - Siuma Abrom, Fraina School, Neya Ool, Laina and the blonde, Kaines' young friend, Yuka Miss, carried plates, pots and bottles from home, sorted the table, driving their male half for a "little walk's".
Standing next to the brazier and inhaling the aroma of grilled sausages, frankly speaking, Rick hardly listened to Abrom, with his incomprehensible and prolonged anecdote, but then, nevertheless, laughed, patted Abrom on the shoulder.
Kines with iron tweezers turned the sausages on the hot grate of the brazier, winced from the smoke - a cigarette, clamped in his lips, was sticking up.
	 - Where did they go?- Abrom Chloe looked towards the front door of the house.
	 - They'll be here now. Some kind of surprise. - Rick shrugged his shoulders, looked at Kines's and quietly asked him.- Where did you hide the bottle?
	 - Let's go to.
An open bottle of vodka, with a small glass cup on its neck, stood behind a tree.
	 - Where is the snack?
	 - Abrom ate our appetizer,- Kines replied, filling a glass with vodka from a bottle.
Rick and Kines drank, returned to the steaming brazier, and Kines began to put the sausages in an aluminum pot.
Abrom chuckled, said:
	 - And why, having such a wealth, to stay in the police? I wouldn't stay a day. Frou is an idiot.
	 - Don't be jealous. - Rick took one of the sausages from the saucepan and almost dropped it from his hand – hot.
	 - I don’t envy.- Abrom looked into the saucepan, then watched Rick blow on the sausage, holding it in the fingers of his right hand, and said..- I just don’t understand.
	 - Now he is a policeman, and who will he be in such a house if he leaves the police?
	 - He will become a free man!- Exclaimed  Abrom.
	 - A free man,- Rick repeated after him, and he and Kines laughed out loud.
	 - And what's wrong with that?
	 - You, henpecked, do not understand. - Rick looked at the face of Abrom's, on which the expression of thoughtfulness, was replaced by stubborn confidence in his own rightness.
	 - He won't die of hunger!
	 - But, and will not unhook from the leash.- Kines winked at him with his left eye, smiling.
	 - Will not unhook. - Rick took a bite of the sausage, mumbled something with pleasure.
	 - What?- Abrom Chloe asked him.
Rick replied:
	 - I say that vodka without snacks is disgusting swill.
	 - So who drinks without a snack ?!
Finally, Frou and Dick left the house.
They walked down the wooden steps of the porch, carrying a large mahogany box, the polished lid of the box gleaming brightly in the sun. They carried this box to the side of the table, neatly, slowly.
	 - Some coffin is being dragged,- Abrom remarked skeptically.- Let's go and see the surprise.
The gratefola turned out to be a surprise.
	 - This is a gratefola,- Frou Ool announced importantly to all the gathered, when the box was placed on a table prepared for him in advance, and he solemnly opened the polished lid of the device, under which was the appearance of an ordinary gramophone familiar to Rik, but with shiny round tuning knobs scale, which is found in expensive radios, added. - Here is the last squeak of engineering! The gramophone is combined with a microphone and a volume amplifier, as in a radio station. Now you can listen to records and turn up the volume like in a radio! Very expensive, but yells like crazy! By the way, they are made to order!
	 - Just think, - grumbled Abrom. - In five years, these will be sold on every corner, by weight.
Soon Frou held out an electric wire from the house, a box with gratefola records appeared next to the gramophone and the party began. The music of the "Night Orchestra" burst out of the "expensive surprise", the sounds of drums and trumpets scattered all over the area. At the table, everyone perked up - they discussed technical progress, prices and the electric train with its monstrous overpass, drank wine (it was decided to leave strong drinks until the evening), and «political decisions Mr. Mayor's».
Then they decided to dance - Rick danced with Laina a slow dance to the music of Odie Ka, hugging her around the waist and pressing her to him, leading her awkwardly and, no matter how hard he tried, he stepped on her foot. However, he was generously forgiven.
	 - I love you, Laina Dots, - the drunk Rick whispered in her ear. - I love, I love.
After the dances, the ladies gathered in a separate flock from the men, as Dick's wife explained, to discuss women's secrets.
In the west, in the dark blue sky, sparks of stars appeared, and a pale, yellow Moon rolled out from behind the stone wall, slowly climbing upward, in a mysterious, pointed sickle.
The volume of the music in the gramophone was turned down so as not to interfere with the neighbors getting ready for bed.
It was getting dark quickly.Although Guy asked everyone "not to dial up to eyebrows before viewing", he wanted the observers through his telescope to be sober and able to enjoy the "indescribable spectacle", Rick nevertheless got decently drunk - he was sitting at a long table, next to Abrom and Mirol, and lazily chewing a sauerkraut leaf, listened to their heated argument about the merits of sports cars.
Neither sports cars, nor their dignity, Rick's was never interested, he just felt good and calm now, and at such moments he could listen to anyone and about anything, without understanding absolutely nothing of what he heard.
	 - Faura-9 has too stiff springs!- Abrom spoke with pressure to Mirol's.- And he is unstable on turns!
	 - Hmm, - and Rick poured himself into a glass of red, ruby wine, drank sips - large to the bottom and, putting the glass on the table, importantly knocked the index finger of his right hand on the stained, greasy, tablecloth, and instructively said to Mirol's.- Not stable.
	 - He has a strong suspension, Lieutenant,- Mirol objected politely.
	 - You listen, listen to what the elders tell you, son, - Rick answered him, slapping him on the strong back. - Abrom knows.
And he thought, looking at Mirol's clean-shaven face, that he, Rick's, was also once twenty-five years old, and now he is limping and there is no longer the same enthusiasm and that if Laina had not appeared in his life, then the further could not be called life at all.
He somehow immediately returned to thoughts, from which he always tried to escape, but which did not go far. These thoughts, like a stray dog that dragged after him somehow from the site to the very house, hoping to get a tasty piece of handout, these thoughts had the same painful clinginess and obsession.
Here, after all, arithmetic is simple, if now he is forty-eight years old, then in ten years he will be ... And Laina is only thirty-four - not a very big difference, but after years this difference will become significant and, possibly, decisive. He wanted to live with her every day in this world, to see her "spring light", to return home in the evening, knowing that she would be there, that she was waiting for him, to hear her voice.
	 - Yes, what are you telling me! - Abrom in his hearts hit the table with his palm, the plates clanged dully. - Shitty gearbox. And the motor is weak. Will not pull!
	 - Will pull it out.
After ten years.
How old will he be in ten years?
He knew it.
How old will she be?
Is there much joy for a young wife from an aging husband?
Rick thought that he didn’t want to see the day when he didn’t see the "spring light" in her eyes, when he noticed carefully hidden regret in Laina's gaze.
Regret.
Rick's mood soured.
He poured into a glass of wine, drank and, getting to his feet, moved towards the lawn.
In the coming dusk, from the house to the table, lamps were lit on a garland of illumination, which was handed out to Frou.
Rick walked unsteadily, taking a pack of cigarettes from his unbuttoned shirt pocket as he walked. On the lawn, immersed in the deepening darkness, children and adults stood gathered near a telescope. Guy was quietly and quietly explaining something to Her and Laina, children - Chems and Reeves frowningly argued with each other, and Kines, sitting on a low stool, looked through the eyepiece of a telescope directed somewhere past the bright moon's.
	 - Rick, you still got drunk, - Guy looked at him reproachfully. - Do not smoke on the children. And on the optics.
	 - Yes, I'm here.
	 - Uncle Guy, tell him not to go out of line!
	 - Chems, give in to him, you are older than him.
Rick looked up at the starry sky.
There, in the bottomless darkness, the lights of the stars burned, like frozen white sparks, they shone on him with their mysterious, distant light, and he suddenly realized that he would no longer be able to look at them, as he had looked before - through the eyes of a surprised, curious child, but sees now in these distant stars someone's home is inhabited, with their own lives and deeds. And it is possible that someone there, the same as he, is now looking in his direction, unhappy and drunk.
Kines got to his feet, his face expressionless, said:
	 - Someday people will fly there.
	 - Definitely,- Rick confirmed.
He was admitted to the spyglass without a queue. He sat down on a stool, put his right eye on the cold edging of the aluminum eyepiece - some light, round spots shone with a dull light and did not at all resemble stars.
	 - Uncle Rick, - Reeves Frou appeared next to him. - We need to turn this wheel.
	 - Uncle Rick would have figured it out on his own,- Chems' displeased voice murmured to Chloe.
And Rick saw the stars, as small as he had always seen them, but clearer, more piercing, they slowly drifted away.
The children’s patience ran out - they suddenly began to shout, jostling next to Rick:
	 - Uncle Rick, let me see!
	 - We will be sent to sleep now!
	 - Everybody, everybody - look. - Rick got to his feet, walked over to Guy's.
	 - Let's go to the table,- Guy suggested.- The ladies can do it without us.
	 - Ladies will cope, - confirmed Fraina Shkola. - And drive my husband here, otherwise this male has been gone for a long time.
At the table, surrounded by women listening to his story, sat Dick School, leaning back in a hard chair, he was quietly talking about something. Approaching the table, Rick heard his words.
	 - And I’m saying, Colonel, isn’t it too early to organize a raid? I told him so.
	 - Dick, - Rick stopped in front of the table opposite the captain. - You are urgently required by the lady captain.
	 - Wait.
	 - She already threatens not with a good word "male".
	 - Oh, - he reluctantly got up, said. - I will go to bright eyes.
	 - But you, gentlemen, are absolutely useless here, - said Suma Abrom with a grin. - Your conversations are boring for us.
	 - And they're driving us out of here.- Guy grabbed two full bottles of cognac.- We're leaving, Rick. Kai, are you with us? Take glasses and a snacks.
The three of them - Rick, Guy and Kines - settled down at a cooled brazier under a maple tree. It smelled of fire and grilled meat, and the light from the garland of lamps by the table dimly illuminated the maple tree trunk, its dry, cracked bark, and the large leaves motionless in the night air.
We drank - the cognac was good.
	 - Yuka and I decided to get married,- Kines said simply.
He lit a cigarette and lay on his back, looking at the sky, and the ember of a burning cigarette dimly illuminated his sharp nose.
	 - And then the career of a private investigator is over.
	 - Condition?- Guy asked him.
	 - An unyielding condition, - he answered. - And maybe it's time. This is my second approach.
They were silent.
Guy drank his brandy and grunted. and asked Rick's:
	 - What about you?
	 - What?- Rick was lying on the grass, staring at the night sky, his mood was lousy.
	 - When are you going to propose to Laina?
	 - Soon.
	 - She loves you, Rick. She will agree. Don't wait too long, boy.- Guy paused for a moment, then said.- I can't get Salina back, even if I gave my life for it. Time flies fast, Rick.
	 - Time flies.
	 - Do you know who you are?
	 - Who am I?
	 - You are an farter Musli!- And Guy laughed good-naturedly, loudly, with a low, chesty laugh.- Do you remember him?- He spoke in a thin voice, imitating someone.- What if there’s an ambush?
Rick couldn't help laughing.
	 - Musli did it.
	 - Did what?- Kines asked.- And who is this Musli?
Guy, laughing, explained to him:
	 - It was a long time ago. One of ours is Musli Davs.
	 - What did he do?
	 - Piled in my pants! During the raid.
	 - Did he shit in his pants? Are you serious?
	 - There is nowhere more serious, going with him to the station was a terrible thing. I still remember his words. "What if there is an ambush?" And he piled!
They laughed and Rick's felt better at heart. He thought that in relation to Laina's, his indecision certainly looked somehow not good and ambiguous, and that the fears that tormented him so were in vain.
Guy and Kines were talking about something, and Rick lay on the cool grass and, looking into the black sky at the twinkling stars, thought of Lyne's.
	 - I’m not Musli Davs.
	 - What?- Guy asked him.
	 - I’m not Musli Davs.
And Rick fell asleep.



                                           *******                                         *******


The morning turned out to be really good - a clear, transparent sky and a weak wind promised that the coming of rain today, you can not be afraid. The whole company went out of town for the weekend, loaded supplies and tents into the trunks of three cars and hit the road. Rick, Guy, Abrom Chloe and, in fact, Kines himself were driving ahead in Kines's car. In the car that followed Laina, Laina, Mona Schopeler, Syuma Chloe and Ney Ool were in the car. At the rear of the procession was his expensive, light-beige «Jatu» Frou Ool's, and with him rode his nine-year-old son Reeves, as well as Abrom's son, Chems, Kines's girlfriend, Yuka Misa, and Doug Schopeler.
Half an hour after leaving the highway, they safely reached the small village of Zeleny Lug.
Sitting behind the steering wheel, Kines Grain occasionally glanced into the rearview mirror, making sure not to leave the cars of his friends far behind. The tarpaulin roof of his Arno-8 was removed.
Guy sat next to Kines, half-turned, unbuttoning his sleeveless white shirt, in oversized, green shorts and a white cap. Rick and Abrom sat on the couch.
	 - It's good that there are no women and children with us. - Abrom Khloy smiled happily. - Otherwise, I can't smoke, I can't express myself! Rick, give me a cigarette.
	 - Your Chems hasn't gotten into a fight with Reeves Frou yet?- Guy asked him.
	 - They are already dividing who will be the first to look through your telescope, Guy.
They gathered for the first time this year for a picnic. The male half of those who had gathered to rest, quickly agreed among themselves about what they would need on vacation, but the female half of the decision dragged on for a long week.
	 - Kai took two army tents! - said Guy, adjusting his cap, which the wind tried to throw off his head.
	 - No storm is terrible.
	 - Frou has two tents with him, and Duk's has one.
	 - Duk's tent is shit. - Guy said categorically. - Last year I slept in it and got wet.
	 - Got the fishing rods?- Rick asked.
Abrom laughed and quipped:
	 - You'd think you'd go fishing. And in general, guys, I’ll tell you, the best time for our picnic is now, while we are driving.
	 - Don't croak.- Guy wrinkled his little nose.- You sure didn't take the gun with you?
	 - Guy, how much can you? Will you peck me forever now?- Abrom frowned.
A couple of minutes later they reached a fork in the road and Kines turned left, and soon the vacationers were met by a grimy, spotted pig, standing at the very side of the road, and next to it sat on a hillock a barefoot boy of about ten, in a light shirt for release and baggy, black pants.
They drove into a gravelled village street lined with one-story houses, gardens and sheds on either side. The air smelled of hay. A wheeled tractor was slowly moving towards them, and its driver, a hefty uncle, dressed in a white T-shirt and dark, greasy trousers of an indeterminate color, waved at them in greeting.
	 - Are we driving the right way?- Kai asked.
Rick replied:
	 - Yes. There, beyond the village, there is a straight road to the river itself. Before reaching, we turn to the ravine and we will be in place. Deciduous forest, glade, beauty!
The sun was rising from the right, bright and warm.
And then Guy said:
	 - Shouldn't we have a glass? There's a pretty good eatery here, guys. And who knows, maybe Abrom is right. The best time is now. Plus, Frou knows the way.
Rick chuckled, he didn't mind. Kines said that if he drinks, then anyone will drive the car, but not he, but Abrom Chloe spoke out, somehow uncertainly, but in principle he was “do not mind”.
	 - We will be eaten, the guys will be eaten alive. - Abrom looked very puzzled.
	 - Okay, I'll take it upon myself, - said Kines. - Guy, where is your diner here?
	 - Over there, behind those houses with a red roof.
Kines pulled the car to the side of the curb and turned off the engine.
	 - You, what? - Abrom looked back hesitantly, then again looked at Kines's with his bulging eyes.
	 - The engine is broken. - Kines turned off the engine, opened the door and began to get out of the car. - We will catch up.
Kines was already opening the hood of his car when Laina's and Frou's cars pulled up beside them.
Climbing out of the car, Duk Shopeller walked busily towards them, waving his pale gray hat in front of his pale face as he walked.
	 - Well, the heat! What have you got here?- He asked, peering over Kines’s shoulder into the engine room.- Serious breakdown?
Rick got out of the car, walked up to him, quietly explained:
	 - The guys decided to skip a little.
	 - What's there? - shouted, looking through the front passenger window, Frou Ool. - For a long time?
Duk was dumbfounded, disdain on his face.
	 - Scoundrels,- he said quietly to Rick, and putting his hat on his head, walked to Laina’s car, shouting as he walked.- They will catch up with us. Minor motor problems. They can handle it, devils skillful.
Suma Chloe, looking at Abrom's, who was sitting in the car, in a voice that did not promise any favors, said:
	 - Abrom Chloe!- She held in her hands a gray tabby cat, and he, pressing his sharp ears to his cat's head, looked at the owner with a pitiful, haunted look.
The sun reflected dazzlingly off the bulging roof of Frou's car.
	 - Honey, you know me.
	 - Not a sip, Abrom. Not a drop!
Inflating with exhaust gases, both cars drove off along a straight road towards the fields looking out between the village houses.
	 - Guys, - said Abrom and wiped sweat from his forehead with his palm. - We have twenty minutes for everything. I'll have a couple of beers and that's it. Guy, check it out.
They left the village eatery only an hour later.
The time was approaching noon.
Outside, in the shade of a wooden plank fence, a homeless black dog was languishing in the heat, covered in burrs adhering to its fur. Sticking out its large, wet tongue, the dog, breathing heavily and rapidly, looked at the people who had come out of the diner.
Abrom and Kines walked out onto the porch of the diner hugging like old friends. Rick and Guy followed them.
	 - Here you are, a pilot, here you tell me. And there, - Abrom lifted up his blonde head and, squinting in the sunlight, sighed loudly and heavily.- Is it probably better there than in Firmness?
	 - There is sky. This is different ... I would give a lot to fly, at least once again. The clouds below you ... Ab, this is fabulous, this is life.
	 - Life, - Abrom repeated after him and, stumbling on the second step, almost fell, but Kaines Grain kept him from falling. - I would have flown away from here too. Would fly away, guys. Fuck it. Exactly.
Guy laughed and slapped him on the back, said:
	 - First, learn to walk, flyer.
For some reason, everyone was unanimous, it was Rick who was chosen the most sober of them all, and now, according to the logic of things, it was Rick who now had to drive Kines' car.
Guy got drunk the most.
Without opening the doors, they tumbled into the car - Abrom was holding in his hand a bottle of vodka he had bought "on the road". Rick took a seat behind the steering wheel. Kines Grain seemed happy, a romantic smile on his lips.
	 - Rick, stop. - he was sitting on the couch, behind Guy, next to Abrom. - From the beginning I must say "by screw's!" My baby is not just a car.
	 - By screw's?
	 - Yes. Exactly. By screw's.
Rick laughed and, starting the engine, shouted, frightening a woman walking by:
	 - By screws!
	 - Crazys!- She screamed.
The engine roared, and the radio immediately began to work, emitting from the speaker under the dashboard quiet, barely audible music.
The car rolled along a straight, country road, turned right at the end of the street, scaring away the proud geese.
They passed the last houses of the village - the apple orchards behind the fences beckoned with their cool shade, and a straight, unpaved road opened up in front of them, going to the horizon, where the firmament pressed against the sky with a low hill overgrown with grass.
	 - Turn up, turn up the volume!- Asked Abrom, and Guy turned the volume knob to the limit, the music hit their ears with guitar chords.
	 - Leave it! This is Home with You.
	 - Rick!- Kines called suddenly. He got to his feet, staggered and, spreading his arms to the sides, shouted joyfully. - Add traction to this baby, push it to the fullest!
	 - Kai, sit down, sit down, you will fall! - this was already shouting Abrom.
	 - Press, Rick! Don't forget to retract the landing gear. We're taking off!
And Rick pressed the accelerator pedal to the limit - the car rushed forward like a whirlwind, leaving behind a red wall of dust.
The music thundered, the guitars beat rhythmically and a male voice sang from the speakers:
           Home with you
           home with me,
           a house with the light of love,
           the house we are in.

           There is quiet joy
           there is a bright peace,
           you are my sweetness
           I am close to you...
Abrom began to sing, almost at the very ear of Rick's - drunkenly out of tune. Kines was already sitting on the couch, peering out from behind the back of the front seat, looking ahead and singing loudly.
           I will not leave,
           there are no worries
           there are roses in the garden,
           and sweet threshold …
It seemed to Rick's that they were rushing at full speed towards the transparent, bright sky, that if you increase the speed a little more, the car would break away from the Firmness's and take off. He did not notice how he began to sing, and Gai, with a reddened, sad face, suddenly burst into tears and, wiping his tears with his hand, drunk, unrestrained, smearing them on his cheeks, said to Rick's:
	 - Tell her, Rick. Don't do that to her. She loves you.
His voice was drowned in the voice of the common song.
           Inseparable now
           there will be no losses
           I'm here
           forever and ever.
           Home is where you are
           home where I am.
           We are loving together.
           Forever, forever …
Rick looked in front of him into the sky, into its endless depth and already believed that they took off. And it was important now, only this movement forward, to the ghostly, hiding in the height, happiness, and the feeling of clear sadness that gripped him and rushed with them in the dust of the road.


                                               *******                                     *******


                                                                   Chapter Eight.


                                                                    White castes.


The afternoon heat penetrated the shadows of the police station - thick and suffocating, the air in Rick's office froze, froze like jelly.
There was no wind on the crowded and noisy street.
	 - Three unidentified corpses in the last month.- Duk Schopeller loomed over Rick’s desk like a street lamp looms over the sidewalk. His dissatisfaction with the ruined reporting of their police station was intensified by complaints about a sultry day.- Now I’ll turn it all into the archive and go to the beach. There is nothing to breathe! Can die here.
Rick was silent.
Signing the expert's papers with photos of deceased and unidentified people pasted into them, his hand, which took the last sheet of the report, froze.
The caption under the photo read:
“Unidentified corpse.
Woman, 45-55 years old, brunette, cause of death - skull base fracture. The injury was received as a result of a collision with a car. "
Then there was a listing of the accompanying injuries to the body, a description of the appearance of the corpse's and the case number.
Rick stared at the photo.
The woman depicted on it was dead. Her head, unnaturally twisted to the right, rested on the asphalt, her black hair was disheveled and lay like a sponge on her shoulders and neck, and her open eyes gazed indifferently somewhere into the distance. There was blood in the corner of her mouth.
Duk asked:
	 - Do you know her?
Rick tried not to hesitate in answering.
	 - Not. She is dressed decently. Such as she is then identified by relatives.
	 - If she has them.
	 - If she has them. When did she die?
	 - There is a date. Two weeks ago.
	 - Yeah. Who was in charge of the case?
	 - Mirol. The one who hit her with a car was not found. Witnesses have seen the car, but are confused in determining its brand. The only thing that is known is that the license plate was smeared with mud.
Rick took another look at the photograph of the woman on the pavement, signed with his black ink pen and gave all the papers to Duk's, said:
	 - I hate all these things with the "lost." - "Lost" in their area was customary to call unidentified corpses. - People are rarely completely alone. This world, Duk, is going down the drain.
	 - He’s already in the cesspool's, Rick.- Duk folded all the sheets with photographs into his leather folder and, patting Rick's on the shoulder, left the office.
He did not close the door behind him.
Rick slowly took the packet of cigarettes on the table, took out one, and lit one. He was looking in front of him, at the opposite wall, where there was a lopsided, wooden stool, and on top of it was a pile of dusty, twine-tied papers.
Tobacco smoke gnawed at his eyes.
Somewhere on the street, entering the office through the wide open window, the impatient horns of horns were heard.
She is dead.
He remembered her face, on the bus, a pale, alert face, a worried, anxious woman who was trying so hard to look business-like.
"- You look a lot like your grandfather, Rickslame."
He entered the date of their meeting in his notebook, but without looking into it, he was sure that she died almost immediately after she got off the bus.
"- The one who shot her down was not found."
And it will not be found.
Murder framed as an accident.
Those who killed her were following her, which means they should know about him, and these people really need that notebook.
Rick crushed a cigarette butt in a glass ashtray - stubborn and angry.
"- You will not get the notebook, gentlemens," - he leaned back in his chair, put his hands on the table: "This number will not work with me."
The words from an old notebook, written by a certain "grandmother Tosya", came to his mind:
"...- Sklim's was killed at the police station, he was shot ..."
Rick buried the alien's notebook in the woods, put it in a tin case from musical records, wrapped the case itself in a tarp. Such or very similar to his anxiety that has arisen now, probably, are experienced by the thieves who hid the stolen things somewhere in a cache. The desire to check whether his notebook was in place now possessed Rick more and more every minute, until he internally stopped these thoughts.
The notebook is in place.
Who will find her? In the woods? Who could see him at night?
He lit a cigarette again.


                                             *******                                   *******


On the wall in Dick School's office, just behind his padded chair, upholstered in brown, worn leather, hung a large map. The sun shone brightly on the desk, piled high with papers on one side and greased wrappers from already eaten pies on the other. A black telephone was piled up to the captain's right, in the thick of the mess on the table.
	 - We have to keep looming, Rick. I understand that the evening will be gone, but they have already cut the police staff, and now they want to cut our salaries too. It seems to these clever people that we are wasting our bread. '' Dick took a drag on his cigarette, winced, shook the ashes into the ceramic ashtray in front of him - once white, but now blackened and ugly. - It's good that I was warned. You will stand on the road for three hours. Some idiot got it into his head to check our work, and now we have to play along with them.
	 - Three hours. Can you send Abrom? I'm up to my neck.
	 - Abroma? Rick, the inspector from the department, might put on a show, and Abrom's tongue is too long. Rick, gotta! Three hours won't play a role for you. Things will wait. Our neighbors will also send one crew each. Damn all these checks. As if we have nothing to do without these checks!
With a grunt, Dick got to his feet, squeezed between the table and the chair, and, turning to the map on the wall, began to run his fat forefinger over it. Rick watched as the captain's finger crawled along Eighteenth Street, turned to the northern quarters (from there it was not far from Rick's house), then, changing his mind, sharply darted across the city to its outskirts and, with inexorable persistence, stopped. Outside Quiet Harbor, on Route Three.
	 - This is where you will loom. - Dick looked into Rick's face with a clear and pure gaze of the chief. - Until nine in the evening. It won't take longer. I do not know the number of the inspectors' car, only its make - "Dorry". Green Dorry. Old.
	 - And when should we move there?
	 - Now move forward. And make sure there are no problems with Guy. You understood me.
	 - I understood you.
	 - Now it's not so hot - the rain has passed, stand there for three hours, you will not die.
	 - It is unclear when we will go about our business. Witness interviews in the stabbing case on 32nd Street will wait. A store robbery investigation, too.
	 - So you haven't interviewed all the witnesses yet?
	 - Interrogated. I called the hospital, they said that the victim could be interrogated. But after all, someone urgently wanted to arrange a show.
	 - This“ someone ”is a major from the county office, Rick.
	 - I see. We drove off.
Rick left the office, closing the door behind him.
In the "corral" there were now three - Abrom Khloy, Guy Ool and Duk Shopeller.
Standing with his back to Rick, Abrom spoke annoyedly to Duk leaning against the railing of the fence. Guy was sitting at his desk with his arms crossed over his chest.
	 - We quarreled with my wife. Still would!
	 - You seem to obey your spouse in everything, - Duk grinned.
	 - I don’t obey her. I avoid cataclysms's.
Guy laughed out loud.
	 - And all this because of the cat?
	 - Yes, because of the cat. She wanted me to take him to the vet for castration. I can close my eyes to a lot, Duk, but this is clearly too much. The swearing was terrible. I would say epic swearing, grandiose!
	 - Which?
	 - Epic!
	 - And you did not flinch?
	 - I did not step back a step, Duk. Not a step.
	 - Male solidarity, I suppose?- Duk Schopeller grinned even wider and nodded in understanding.
	 - There is no solidarity here. This is the question of preserving the life of an unfortunate animal. Not only did they bring him to our house as a kitten, they also want to cut off his eggs!
	 - What? Hmm. After castration, cats stop putting their piss marks in the corners, and generally behave calmly.
	 - Duk, do you not understand what I am talking about? What does the label have to do with it? Cut the eggs to the cat and he will cease to be a cat. He will become anyone, but not who he was before. For example, we have a tree growing right in front of the kitchen window. Sometimes I drink tea and watch my Roar. He sits on the windowsill, the window is open and looks at a pigeon on a branch. A decent distance to the tree, but he still sits and decides to jump. Do you understand? And he doesn't care that the house is full of grub even without this pigeon, and that there is a dog below. Spit! Life pushes him forward!
	 - Eggs,- said Duk.
	 - Life, Duk, life. And so he jumps, misses and flies down, and runs away from the dogs to the trash can, behind which there is a hole in the fence. And the point is not whether he caught this pigeon or not, but that he made the decision to jump. He jumped and flew. And I have no doubt that at that moment, he was happy. He lives in moments like this. Like all of us.
	 - We all. Abrom, I personally don't jump out of the window.- Duk smiled.- I can, of course, go to a restaurant on Ninth Street, but …
	 - If you cut off the eggs, Duk …
	 - Don't croak!
	 - It's not about the eggs, it's about keeping everything in its place! I don't want her to make my cat disabled.
	 - That's what, gentlemens, disabled people, - Dick School, who had previously stood silently in the open door of his office, now indicated his presence with a voice. When you're done talking about cat eggs, take care of yours and get to work guys before we all get kicked in the butt with a knee. Rick, take Guy and fly to the place. Abrom, imagine what your wife will do to you if you are out of work. You will go to the hospital and interrogate the victim - Rick will explain. Guy, I really hope for you. Do you understand? Excellent. Now let's get down to business, get down to business, guys. Get up and go!



                                             *******                                      *******


A weak breeze stirred helplessly the suffocating, closed air, saturated with moisture evaporating in the sun. The past short downpour managed to soak everything around with water, but the thunderclouds that had gone to the west bare the earth for the hot, merciless, exhausting sun.
The second half of the day was more painful than the first.
Route number three, running away from the city to the south, in a straight, asphalt line, quickly heated from the sunlight, the puddles evaporated, the air over the road trembled like a flame over a fire.
Grasshoppers chirped in the high lush grass on both sides of the track, bumblebees and bees buzzed, hurrying about their business.
Rick took a handkerchief from his breast pocket and wiped his sweaty neck with it, grimacing.
A police car with an open right, front door, stood, dropping off the road to the side of the road, and in it, like an idol, sat frozen in the passenger seat, with a newspaper in his hands, Guy Ool. Sunlight reflected intolerably off the shiny radiator grille and windshield, flashed on the bumper with dazzling, blurred lightning.
Rick walked around the large transparent puddle between the police car and the white two-door Fasta 3B - without a roof, with narrow dirty wheels and a dent on the right, dirty side, and stopped a step away from the driver. "Fasta" was old, the good days were long gone for him - the engine of the car rattled, threatening to stall. 
The driver turned out to be a middle-aged lady, in a yellow straw hat and cotton, pink dress, sleeveless. Straw hair framed her slightly elongated face, a guilty smile on her narrow lips.
Standing on the edge of a puddle, Rick saluted and said:
	 - Good afternoon, madam. Lieutenant Rickslem Yark. Second police station. Please show your documents.
	 - Good afternoon, officer, - the woman took out a thin bundle of documents from the compartment of the "glove compartment", handed it to Rik's.-  Am I exceeding the speed limit?
Her documents were in order.
	 - No, madam, you have not exceeded the speed. - Rick returned the woman her documents. - Simple formality. Our whole life consists of formalities.- He smiled at her with the smile of a martyr, feeling a drop of sweat running down his back.
	 - As you exactly said, - the elongated, simple face of a woman suddenly lit up with the very smile that people who love to talk smile with. - My brother thinks that everything in life is nothing. And nothing can convince him. He married a trifle, got divorced because of a trifle, and now pays trifling alimony! But how can it be trivial? What about children? Are they to blame for the fact that their father ... It is a shame in front of relatives. And the neighbors?
Rick tried to quickly rid himself of this conversation, he stepped back a little, entered a puddle, saluted and said with a smile of a man coming to life from death:
	 - You can go, madam. Have a nice day.
And then Rick was poured water from head to toe, as if slightly pushed in the back. A stream of water splashed out of a puddle whipped across the car and the woman's face. Looking around, Rick saw a bright red car slipping away into the distance.
"Bully".
Rick rushed to the police car through the puddle, immediately getting his feet wet. Opening the door and falling into the driver's seat, he had already forgotten about the talkative madam.
The motor sprang to life and the car jerked forward.
	 - Here, bitch!
	 - She is? What is she?
	 - Not she, but he!! This shit nearly knocked me over! Turn on the siren.
The heavy police car accelerated steadily, the hot wind beat through the open windows.
	 - You're all wet.
	 - But I'm alive. He did it on purpose.
Rick pressed the accelerator pedal down to the limit, the siren roar beat in his ears, the car rushed along the road like a flying projectile. Of course, police cars could not boast of a luxurious interior or maneuverability that expensive cars like the “Bully” have, but when racing on a straight line they were not inferior in speed.
As Abrom said, “grab the scruff”.
And Rick "grabbed the scruff of the neck," the cheeky "Bully".
Power poles flashed outside the window, oncoming cars pressed to the side of the road, drying puddles sparkled.
A few minutes later, the red "Bully" grew from a small red spot to a car sparkling in the sun.
Rick caught up with the "Bully" and began to push him to the side of the road.
The chase ended, soon both cars froze on the spot - "Bully" stopped at the side of the road, the police car stopped in front of him.
	 - Come on. - Rick got out of the car, unbuckling his pistol holster as he walked.
In the "Bully" there were two youngsters, eighteen, twenty years old. The one behind the wheel, a tough guy with a full, round face and short-cropped blond hair, smiled a condescending smile at Rick's who approached. The second, sitting in the passenger seat, dark and skinny, did not seem to notice anything, the look of his face was distant.
	 - Get out of the car.
	 - Officer, what's the matter? I exceeded the speed? - The youngster smiled broadly. - I did not notice.
Guy was getting out of the police car, huge as a bear.
Rick, without answering, opened the driver's door and pulled the driver out of the passenger compartment, laid him on the asphalt and, wringing the guy's hands behind his back, handcuffed them.
	 - Do you know who my uncle is? You're a cap!- The guy's voice broke to a squeal.
"You".
"Cap".
The guy, as if recovering from surprise, began to resist.
The "Bully" rocked, it was Guy who got to his passenger.
	 - You are detained for creating a dangerous situation for a law enforcement officer and exceeding the speed limit. - Rick jerked the detainee to his feet, and he, blushing with anger, tried to kick Rick's in the groin, but missed and barely stood on his feet.
	 - You will crawl on all fours, - the youth hissed, tears sparkled in his gray, small eyes. - You will ask forgiveness. Cap.
Rick laughed, his recent anger receding into amusement.
Guy was already leading the second guy's.
	 - It's not good to behave like that, guys, - Guy said instructively. - You have upset uncle.


                                          *******                                        *******


	 - Sign this and it might be okay.- Dick School stood face to face with Rick, his mouth stank of tobacco and fumes.- I'm not kidding, Rick. The jokes were over.
The captain's office was stuffy and smoky.
	 - I took him, and only I will decide when he gets out of here, Dick.
	 - It's a different protocol.
	 - That's not the protocol, Dick.
	 - Then this will be the protocol that is needed. This is the mayor's nephew!- Dick hissed in Rick's face, bulging his eyes like a cancer.- He is the mayor's nephew, damn you! You expose us all - me guys, yourself - in the first place. And if they are pissed off, then they know how to skin anyone. The mayor's secretary called, they made it clear to me what would happen if the guy was not released.
	 - And I don't care about this pig. I didn't vote for him.
Dick took a step back and wiped his sweaty face with his hand.
	 - I was already on my way home. If i knew. I should have sent Abrom's there instead of you.
Rick took a pack of cigarettes from the breast pocket of his uniform shirt, lit a cigarette from a gas lighter, calmly looked into Dick's face.
	 - He nearly knocked me over, Dick.
	 - But he didn’t knock you down.
Rick chuckled.
	 - Now his lawyer will come rushing here. We will still be skinned, but if you don’t sign, we will be devoured. They will devour us along with the shit!
	 - I won't sign, Dick. He will sit in a cell before the trial, and after the trial, too.
For a few seconds Dick thought about something, looking somewhere past Rick's head, then his gaze came to life and he said in a firm, commanding tone:
	 - Lieutenant Rickslem Yark, you are stepping back from this case pending clarification. In the meantime, you can go, you are free.
	 - Suspension order, Dick. I do not see him.
	 - Get the hell out of it, Rick! I've had enough of your shit. You're suspended, get out.
Rick stepped to the table, shook the ashes from the cigarette into the ceramic ashtray and said:
	 - You've changed a lot, Dick School.
	 - And you, as you were a cretin, remained so. I'm trying to keep your pension, Rick!. If all this does not calm down, then tomorrow you will already be unemployed. And trust me, this will be just the beginning.
	 - You've changed, Dick. Listen to what I tell you. What's on your badge? “Protect and Guard”. People who live outside of this site are counting on this.
	 - Only without this policy of yours. Go home. I'll clean up all this shit myself.
	 - How much blood was shed, how many lives were broken, and all for what, Dick? For the White Castes to return in fifty years?
	 - What White Castes?- Dick said in a strangled voice, his cheeks flushed with a crimson blush.- What are you talking about?
	 - I said - White castes!
	 - I'll go crazy with you. - Dick raised his voice. - We have a free society and the White castes are a relic of the past.
	 - Well done, Dick. You will go far.
There was a knock on the office door and, without waiting for permission, the visitor opened it and entered the office, tightly closing the door behind him.
	 - Good evening, gentlemen,- the visitor was a tall, slender middle-aged man, completely bald, with clear green eyes on a wide, high-cheekbone face, he was dressed in an expensive beige suit, without a tie, and the same beige shoes. On his index finger of his left hand glittered a gold ring, with a large white stone.- My name is Shelt Tsei,- he beamingly smiled at the police, flashing the whiteness of his impeccable teeth, shook hands first with Dick, then with Rick.- I am the lawyer of the detainee Zhuga Mara's. Would like to talk to you about freeing him.
	 - Good evening, Mr. Tsei. Captain Dick School, this is Lieutenant Rickslem Yark. Please sit down, we will discuss everything with you and decide for the best solution to the issue, - Dick changed, a relaxed smile of a hospitable host lit up on his sweaty face.
Dick waited for the guest to sit in the chair in front of the table, then he squeezed over to his chair and sat down in it.
The smile never left his face.
Rick remained standing, there were only two chairs in the office.
Rick's cigarette went out, he took his stinking lighter out of his pocket and lit a cigarette from it.
	 - If you do not mind, gentlemen, then I would like to get acquainted with the reasons for the detention of Zhuga Mara.
	 - The reason is trifling, - Dick shook out a cigarette from a pack of cigarettes, she capriciously did not want to fly out, then he took it out with the fingers of his right hand, lit a cigarette, threw the pack on the table.
Dick's hands were trembling.
	 - A trivial reason, Mr. Tsei,- Dick repeated, looking into the lawyer’s friendly face.- A misunderstanding. Slight overspeeding and nothing more.
	 - That is, you admit the illegality of the detention of my client?
	 - The misunderstanding has already been settled, we have just resolved this issue with ... the lieutenant.
	 - Who detained Zhuga Mara's?
	 - Uh, our employee detained him, - Dick looked at his smoldering cigarette, then at the lawyer.
	 - I got him,- Rick said calmly.
	 - For a slight speeding? - Tsei looked at Rick's, and there was no change in his radiant smile, only his gaze sharpened, the fixed gaze of attentive green eyes. - You have exceeded your official powers, mister lieutenant. Slight speeding implies a fine, but not forceful detention, causing physical and mental harm. I can guarantee you at least an official investigation. Least.
Rick noted that Tsei was not sweating.
	 - Mister Tsei, - Dick leaned forward, his face assumed a conciliatory expression. - We can agree here, oh ... Mne, eh, uh ... What is this misunderstanding …
	 - We won't be able to, mister captain.- Tsei, apparently having learned everything he wanted, easily got to his feet and stepped to the door from the office, he did not look at Dick's.- In a telephone conversation, my client reported about the injuries inflicted on him during the arrest, and I will immediately refer him to the first county clinic for evaluation and treatment. I will also file a lawsuit with the city police and win it. You're in big trouble, gentlemen. Very large and very unpleasant. Next time, you will think carefully about your actions in relation to ... - He stopped pointedly and finished, looking into Rick's face. - About his actions.
Rick put the butt of his cigarette in the ashtray in front of Dick and, sitting in the chair that was vacated at the table, began to take a second cigarette out of the packet. He did not look at Tsei's.
	 - Of course, Mr. Tsei, you can visit your client. It is your right. But he won't go anywhere. Until the trial. - Rick lit a cigarette and looked into Dick's white face, said. - The reason for his detention is much more serious. Ask the captain of the School for the protocol of detention and everything will become clear to you. I'm afraid you misunderstand what is happening.
Dick leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes, the smile disappeared from his puffy face, his cheeks drooped.
Tsei went to the window and looked at Dick's, said without a smile:
	 - Captain, I'd like to see this.
	 - "This" is called the protocol, and it would be worth looking at right away, Mr. Tsei. - Rick wrapped himself in tobacco smoke. - I assure you that next time I will detain anyone. Regardless.
Dick opened the top drawer of his desk and took out a paper sheet of the arrest protocol, silently handed it to Tsei's.
A minute later, the lawyer said:
	 - It says here, "for creating a danger for a law enforcement officer." What does it mean?
	 - He drove dangerously close to me when I was on duty.
	 - How close is he to you, drove?
	 - Closer than you are now standing to me, Mr. Tsei. At the same time, the speed of his car was three times higher than the speed allowed for that section of the road. With witnesses. This is how things stand.
The lawyer smiled:
	 - Lieutenant, I guess that the reason for the detention is an absurd accident, the boy, unwillingly, sprinkled you from a puddle.
	 - Mr. Lieutenant.
	 - Mr. Lieutenant. I believe that this case can be settled in this office. He will, of course, pay the fine.
	 - Fine.
	 - Fine. We were all young and windy, Lieutenant. I think that you may well meet us halfway. And the boy drew conclusions for himself. Trust me.
"The boy drew ."
Rick looked directly into the lawyer's eyes and said:
	 - The boy will be in prison until the trial. I'll meet you there.
Tsei turned to Dick's:
	 - Mr. Captain, you are the boss and you can settle everything here and now.
	 - Only with an order for my suspension.- Rick looked at his extinguished cigarette.
	 - Lieutenant, you are suspended from this case. I'll write the order ... tomorrow.
	 - Tomorrow. - Rick got to his feet heavily, something nasty pulling in his stomach. - Write, mister captain. You are the boss here. Just remember, Dick, the next time the jerk wants to have some fun in front of his buddies, they will come to your office and spit in your face, and you will wipe yourself off and stand at attention. People like you raise the White caste. People like you.
The office became very quiet.
Dick's face went from pale to crimson.
	 - You're free, Lieutenant.- Dick began to get up from his chair.
Rick stepped towards the door and said to Tsei's:
	 - I wonder how the district attorney will look at this story.
	 - One minute, mister lieutenant, - the lawyer smiled peacefully. - There is no need to exaggerate this incident to universal proportions. We are all a little tired and nervous, and this heat is also ... Let's be prudent. We are adults, why should we rush to extremes? There are times in life when you need to help each other. If, say, you have some kind of trouble tomorrow, then you will not be left alone with your trouble. You have a specific job, and good friends will never be superfluous. And Mr. Mayor is a good friend of the chief of the city police.
	 - Friendship with superiors always stinks. Rick answered him, and asked Dick's, frozen like an idol. - So, what about the order, captain?
A black telephone rattled on the table, Dick quickly picked up the receiver, said:
	 - Second police station ... Yes I am, Colonel. Yes, Mr. Colonel. Yes, of course, we have already decided with this, - he put the receiver on the telephone and said dully to Rick's. - Go on duty. - Dick School ran his hand over his sweaty face. - There will be no order.
And Rick left the office.
Seeing him, Guy Ool got up from his table's and followed Rick out of the "Corral's".
As he got into the police car, he asked:
	 - How did it end?
	 - It all ended in shit.
	 - We will show them who is the law!
	 - Do you think?
Rick jerked the car forward and they raced through the intersection and onto Twelfth Street.
	 - Guy, turn on the radio.
	 - What, after talking with Dick, do you want to dance?
Twisting the shiny handle of the radio, Guy found a radio wave, which was broadcasting the concert of the Orchestra of Sparks.
	 - Will sparks work?
	 - The Sparks are delicious, Guy.
Guy, blushing with his full face, sang raspingly, imitating Gerai Soma's:
       Dance baby,  вance,
       walk around
       let your hips,
       shake my house!
The gentle evening Sun filled everything around with its light, its rays gave Guy's face an even more red tint, and his little nose now seemed crimson.
Rick laughed.
      Oh baby,
      stomp your right foot,
      stomp your left,
      Spin like a tornado...
The car rushed forward along the street to meet the coming evening.


                                              *******                                  *******


After the intersection of East Avenue and Twenty-first Street, Rick stopped their police car outside a bakery with the affectionate name "Bars", and now, standing on the curb, leaning against the warm metal of the car roof, he was smoking in anticipation of Guy's. This bakery was opened here recently. Before that, in the basement of an old, red brick three-storey building, there was a cleaning of clothes "Shining". But something in this "Shining's" went wrong, and to replace the hurried townspeople carrying their bundles and bags of dirty linen into the wooden door of the basement, there came no less hurried citizens, with bags and string bags for bakery products.
At the very exit of the bakery, to the right of the only shabby step in front of the door, was a beggar. Rick was looking at him because there was not much to look at.
The beggar was old.
Probably, he was already over seventy years old, his big head, against the background of narrow, bony shoulders, was overgrown with dirty, gray hair. Apparently, the beggar shaved a few days ago. He lowered his dull and emaciated face down, and looked at his bare, dirty feet. He was sitting right on the pavement, spreading several sheets of newspaper under him, in dirty blue tights, in a T-shirt stretched out and no less dirty than his tights.
Before the old man stood a small tin can for coins, and on it a drawn, red tomato gleamed merrily.
During the time, while Rick stood and looked at the beggar, none of the passers-by paid their attention to the old man's, people passed by him as if past an empty place.
The door to the bakery swung open and Guy stepped out, carrying in his right hand an imposing paper bag, from which the golden sides of the patties peeped out.
	 - Let's go. - Guy went to the car, opened the rear passenger door and carefully put a paper bag on the leather sofa, straightened up, and then he saw a beggar.
	 - Go.
Rick walked around the car and was about to get behind the steering wheel when he saw Guy heading towards the beggar. He went up to the old man and stopped next to him, Guy's shadow fell on the beggar.
Guy silently reached into the pocket of his trousers and shook coins out of it.
	 - How did it happen to you, grandfather?
The beggar was blind.
Only now Rick could make out his eyes when he turned his cheeky face to Guy. The beggar's eyes were solid, light, and unpleasantly dull.
	 - And how does it happen? - the beggar smiled not cheerfully and Rick heard his voice, hoarse, broken. - At first you are young and it seems to you that the whole world is at your feet. You make plans, you live in full force. You have a wife and kids and a nice home. And then, something changes in this arranged world, son. Something that does not depend on your desires and capabilities. And you're here with a beggar's can. And you are no longer at home, because you are not needed, not by the old woman's wife, not by the children. And the house ... Other people live in it, making plans and living in full force.
The blind beggar smiled bitterly.
Rick did not notice the tears in his whitish eyes.
	 - Life is not always what we expect from it, son.
Guy rummaged through all his pockets. He collected a handful of coins and, leaning over to the blind man's, put the money in his thin palms and, silently turning away, stepped back to the car.
As they drove along Vostochny Avenue, Guy did not utter a single word.
	 - We’ll be on duty for two hours and leave,- said Rick, looking at the road.- Enough of today's adventures.
	 - Rick.
	 - What?
	 - He had a wife and children.
	 - I have heard.
	 - That is, they are still there. I think there is. They no longer needed him.
Rick didn't answer.
Guy was silent for a few more minutes - they had already passed the business part of the city, behind the windows of their car, the monotonous, dark brown three-story houses of the residential quarter stretched.
	 - I don’t want to go there, Rick. I do not want. A lonely, blind drunk, with an empty can of cans, and know that that's all. Everything is over. And with you, and for you. And sit there and pee under you.
Rick glanced at Guy's.
He shook his head, his eyes were wide open, looking somewhere ahead, and tears glistened in them.
	 - I’m not going to be like that, Rick! I won't let that happen.
	 - You won't be like that. I'll talk to Laina today. She will find you a good eye doctor. If necessary, you will go to the capital. You are a police officer, you have a seniority and …
	 - I will not allow this. Never!- He fell silent for a few seconds, his plump, flushed face took on an expression of fierce determination, and Guy repeated, hoarsely.- Never!



                                                *******                              *******


	 - I’ve already explained everything to you, Rick.
Laina, in a home, light dressing gown, embroidered with intricate, multi-colored patterns, in soft, home-made "slippers", the color of straw, stood at the kitchen table, putting mashed potatoes from an enamel saucepan into two plates's.
	 - Maybe he was wrong?- Rick asked her, but he already knew what he was asking Laina's, a stupid question.
Guy went to see a doctor today.
Before lunchtime, Rick took Guy to the city hospital where Laina worked, to the doctor with whom she arranged to see Guy.
	 - You doctors are sometimes wrong.
	 - Not in this case, Rick.
Rick remembered how, having visited the doctor, Guy got into their police car, and almost to their station, shouted and scolded's the "bespectacled dropout", "who himself is almost blind."
	 - When?
Laina put the saucepan on a metal stand, sat down at the table, and said:
	 - Put the meat yourself, otherwise you will grumble again.
	 - When?
She looked straight into his eyes, replied:
	 - In six months, maximum a year, Guy will not see beyond his own nose. In two years he will be completely blind. Dr. Fout explained his situation to him as delicately as possible, but the diagnosis is accurate.
	 - Is two years the last term for him?
	 - You did not understand. In a year he will become disabled. And after two, absolutely blind. And two years, according to Dr. Fout, is the most optimistic outlook, Rick. Most optimistic. Even if the prescribed treatment is adhered to, two years is the deadline. But he is unlikely to observe this treatment. Rick, you need to talk to Guy, this is an extremely painful topic for him, he feels …
	 - Yes.
	 - Tell him that he will not remain alone, that we will not leave him. We will always be by his side. Tell what...
Rick remembered the blind beggar at the door of the Bar, his words, spoken sarcastically and calmly: "- Life is not always what we expect from it, son."
Rick's imagination suddenly clearly drew Guy's sitting by that wooden door with cracked glass, shaggy and dirty, drunk, in a pool's of his own urine, and next to him an empty tin can, with a bright tomato pattern on a crumpled tin side.
	 - Maybe it makes sense to go to the capital? All these luminaries of medicine …
He still spoke these words to Laina's, but already knew their meaninglessness and emptiness.
The evening smoothly turned into night.


                                              *******                                   *******


                                                                  Chapter nine.


                                                                        Dolls.


The next day, an hour before lunchtime, there was a robbery of a car workshop in a workers' quarter, behind the central park. There were no shooting and no corpses. Until the end of the day, Rick, Guy, Abrom and, armed with their black suitcase with tools, Duk, were engaged in this business. While Abrom Chloe interrogated the victims - two mechanics and a cashier, Rick and Guy interrogated the residents of two houses adjacent to the car workshop and checked the yards closest to the crime scene. To them could not find any witnesses, except for one drunken vagrant and, as Rick's thought, not entirely sane, who claimed to have seen two criminals, but describing their appearance, contradicted himself and got confused in the testimony. If you believe his words, it turned out that the workshop was robbed by at least five people who were not similar to each other. At the end of the conversation, the tramp asked Guy's "a quarter for a drink", for which he received a strong kick in the ass and was released. When Rick and Guy returned to the car workshop, they found Duk shouting about "a herd of idiots" and "the impossibility of working in such conditions." Duk said he has a bunch of shoe prints, half of which are clearly from Guy's and Rick's.
Rick happily met the end of the working day, gave Guy's a ride in a police car to his house and, dropping into the station and handing over the cases to Mirol's, who was on duty there, went home.
The sun had already set behind, crushed by the facades of buildings, the horizon, the sky, finally cleared of clouds, darkened, from the north, along Rowan Boulevard, where Rick got off the city electric train, a cool breeze was blowing, dispelling the heat of the day, filling the air with pleasant freshness and the smell of growing along the sidewalk, magnolias's.
To the left, in the east, looking out in a narrow alley between the bulky department store and the city's philharmonic hall, the first large star appeared in the sky.
Twilight was creeping in.
The street lamps will be lit soon, and the city has finally said goodbye to the hustle and bustle of the day and will prepare for a good night.
Rick loved this time - you can relax and calmly think about the house, about Laina's, and also, about the notebook's.
Rick walked out onto the sidewalk of Maple's Square's.
The further he went into the square, the quieter it became around, the noise of cars passing along the roadway of the Resistance Avenue that remained behind him. The noise of the streets here became more muffled, the sight of darkened maples evoked childhood memories on him.
This square was very similar to the park near Rick's parental home, where he lived until the age of seventeen, where, as a boy, he played with friends, and even managed to break his left wrist, falling from a tree onto a lawn overgrown with thick grass.
Rick smiled.
Just like that, to myself.
He noticed a large black passenger car with an iron roof parked on the boulevard. The car was in front of Rick, the big headlights off, the engine off.
Rick looked, and could not determine its make in any way, like the outlines of the body were familiar, and at the same time he was ready to swear that he had never seen such cars. Perhaps foreign, perhaps recently released from the factory.
Cars were prohibited from entering the boulevard. It was a place for pedestrians, a place where there was no room for cars, and now, some impudent man drove onto a wide sidewalk and stopped under the trees, in the thick evening shade.
It was no more than a hundred paces from the black car to Rick.
Halfway through the distance, he saw three black figures emerge from the shadows of the trees. At first, Rick thought they were three men, dressed in tailored suits and round hats, like funeral agency employees. But after a few seconds, he saw among them a slender female figure. They parted, one of the men crossed the sidewalk and froze under a thick, dark tree, the other remained standing in his place by the curb. The woman was walking towards Rick. She walked towards him, with a kind of awkward, bouncing gait, and somehow strangely rearranging her legs, as if they were too long for her. Rick slowed down, reached for the holster that hung on his right belt, his fingers as usual unfastened the lock, lay down on the cold, grooved handle, pulled the pistol up.
And then they turned on the street lighting, the lantern on the pole behind him flashed brightly with a yellow, transparent fire, and everything around came to life with colors diluted with the yellow light of the lantern, took on clear outlines and shape.
Rick froze in place, his hand with the pistol clutched in it, dropped down and remained helplessly hanging like a whip.
He made out a woman approaching him.
Her legs, long and thin, in black, tapered trousers, were longer than they should be. They were like the ridiculous stilts of a circus clown.
Rick looked at her knees, they were bent wrong. For an endlessly long moment he tried to recognize as reality what his eyes were now seeing. Namely, the woman’s knees did not bent forward, like all people, but backward, like a chicken or a cat. Her hips rose and fell like a swing with each step, and her arms hung motionless along her short, black-blazed torso.
He could already shoot, without waiting for further action, without announcing her rights to her, because people did not have such wrong legs, and she walked right at him, carrying silent and the same wrong intentions, and her two accomplices, took their places in the shade, under the trees.
Rick stood nailed to his place by misunderstanding and fear. He forgot about the pistol in his hand, he was not even going to run.
He was flooded with a sudden fear, suffocating, freezing, which happened to him in his childhood in a dream, when, tormented by a delusional nightmare, he tried to scream and could not open his mouth. This paralyzing feeling emanated from a woman approaching him in a black undertaker's suit - waves of viscous fear, or rather similar to long, invisible tentacles, with which she seemed to grab Rick from a distance, like a spider holding its victim in a thin, strong web.
Having made the last few awkward, impossible steps, the woman was one step away from Rick, stopped abruptly, as if had heard the command of a soldier.
And he saw her face.
It was the face of a doll - pale gray, smooth and gleaming by the light of a street lamp, glossy, porcelain cheeks, painted with bright red paint, a small toy mouth, and a tiny button nose without wings. 
Rick stared into the face in front of him. The eyes of the doll woman did not have irises. Large black wells of pupils, namely wells, without cornea, like two pistol barrels, not movable, stared at him, and in their depths, Rick saw a faint, greenish light.
From under the black hat, curls of shiny hair dangled over her smooth forehead, and Rick saw that those shiny curls were also painted with black, glossy lacquer, right on her wrinkle-free forehead, smooth and shiny. The doll's small, pale mouth did not flinch as she spoke.
Actually, it was not a voice in the usual sense of the word - Rick heard her words in his head, felt her emotions in his gut, his suffocated breath.
	 - Do you want to talk?
And a second later again:
	 - Do you want to talk?
Rick was silent.
Even if he really wanted to answer her, he could not do it - he was seized by tetanus. Rick's chest, as if crushed by a huge weight, could not contain the air for screaming.
	 - I'll talk to you. I will speak with you, with a purpose. - Eyes - wells fixedly looked into Rick's face. - We must obey in order to live. Will you obey? Do you want to live? Live? Eat and sleep with her, ride in the car and talk to the fat one. Life is obedience. Do you want to live? Do you want? Do you want?
Rick could smell the smell coming from her - cold, not alive, not familiar, as if he got into a new car and for the first time caught the smells of gasoline and artificial leather, a new, freshly varnished body. The smell was unfamiliar to him, but he understood the feeling he was experiencing now. This happens if you stand in front of a car with a running engine, in front of a car without a driver, and it growls and shines in your face with its headlights, ready to jump out of place and crush, kill. In this car, which was now in front of him, there was no driver, but some forces pressed and pressed the pedal of its internal accelerator, and its engine growled in time with these movements, giving the car power and direction.
Rick's feelings and imagination were mixed into a dreary mess, and only fear, a stranger, inspired, was clear and precise. She was silent for a short two seconds and spoke again, and it seemed to Rick that these were not words, but fists-hammers with which she hit him with direct blows to the head, hitting him in the stomach, knocking out the last stale air from his lungs:
	 - This is a forbidden territory. Yours is not yours. It cannot be given to others. You can't! You will die. You will die. They will come beyond the forbidden territory. Don't give it to them. Don't tell them. We will be back. We know.
Rick caught some movement to the right, and immediately, with a peripheral vision, made out people passing by. Two, a man and a woman. He could not see what they were wearing, only silhouettes blurred by the yellow light of a street lamp. The man spoke in a low, low voice, and Rick knew from the sound of his voice that the man turned his head and looked at him:
	 - Maybe,- the man said,- if Dorrie comes over that week.
	 - Don't be frank with her, Gee,- the woman said quietly, and for some reason Rick's imagined that she was holding her companion by the arm and was also looking at the policeman standing in the middle of the sidewalk and his interlocutor in a black, funeral suit.- I don't want it to be like last time …
They went further, talking about something among themselves - calm, resting, and Rick stood in front of the doll, overwhelmed with fear, helpless and paralyzed.
	 - No one will help, - the voice of the doll sounded in his head, and Rick heard this time a real sound coming from the inside of the doll-car - low, quiet, like the sound of an approaching electric train. - We know. We go where we need to. Free. Always. We are like everyone else.
“Free.”
“Always.”
“Everyone else.”
“- This is not normal,” - now these were his- Rick's thoughts, he internally trembled, trembled, his consciousness desperately wanted to break free from the unreality of what was happening, to give all this support, an explanation. "- I'm out of my mind".
And the doll stirred, he saw how the black, patent bangs on her forehead flashed in the light of the lantern, and she abruptly, throwing her thin hand forward, grabbed his right forearm, and Rick cried out from a sharp, burning pain, as if she were with her tenacious tore out a piece of muscle from him with her fingers.
	 - Don't play with us. Don't play with us. We know. We go where we want. Do not play. Do not play.
Rick's pistol crashed against the asphalt with a booming, steel sound.
Taking two steps back, the doll turned around and quickly walked away, and Rick saw two of her companions emerge from the shadows and went, as if on command, to the black car, opened the front door.
Another minute, and the car hummed softly, its rear, red lights flashed and, quietly rustling the tires, drove out into the middle of the sidewalk and rolled down the boulevard.
It was all over.
The fear that had just gripped Rick by the throat with an iron grip disappeared, and a burning pain spread down his right hand.
It began to shake.
His teeth knocked out a frequent beat, his face was numb, and his whole body was shaking with a fever, as if from a strong cold, and a frost arose in his chest, a "piece of ice", and this "piece of ice" could not thaw and return warmth and life to the body.
Like a helpless cripple, Rick bent down and with shaking hands picked up his pistol, not immediately, but managed to push the weapon with disobedient fingers into the holster. 
He took several hesitant steps to the side, leaned against the rough tree trunk and, holding his sore arm with his right hand, threw his head back - the cap fell off his head.
Rick breathed deeply and often, it seemed to him that there was not enough air around, that his lungs were dry and dead as paper, as rough as his dry lips.
Rick's familiar and natural world cracked. Next to what was always familiar and his own, the impossible and delusional arose, it found its place and outlines, as real as the tree under which he was now standing.
"We know".
They know.
They come when they want.
Somewhere far behind him, with a hum and a frequent clatter of wheels, a city electric train swept along the overpass.
Rick didn't go home, he forgot to think about home. A small, disgusting tremor was beating him, his right hand seemed to be on fire, as if his biceps had been pulled out and a bone had been broken.
Trying to regain his composure, Rick hastened to leave the boulevard lit with rare lanterns, returned to the department store, already closed and deserted, stood for a long time near the brightly lit window, looking at the crystal displayed on the glass shelves, then his gaze rested on two mannequins, in fashionable, male suits and black, wide hats. Rick shuddered, walked away and walked towards the nearest eatery.
He came home to Laina, two and a half hours later, drunk and confused.
She, of course, saw his right hand as he, wincing in pain, tried to pull off his blue shirt.
	 - Rick!
	 - Detention, - he fell on the bed and buried his face in the pillow, closed his eyes.
	 - Can you move your fingers?
	 - It was a healthy type. Very healthy.
	 - We dealt with it with difficulty.
Rick quickly fell asleep, as if he had fallen into a deep black and stuffy pit. He dreamed that he was standing on the night, endlessly long alley, dark maples rise around him, between their rough trunks an impenetrable darkness is ripening and hiding. This gloom flooded everything in front of the maple alley, saturated the whole world with blackness and the expectation of horror. Rick looks ahead, to where in the blackness of the night a deserted path is lost, and from there something invisible, formidable and inexorable as death, silent as a grave rushes towards him. Rick knows that there is no place to wait for help, that no one will help him. He raises his hand with a pistol, aims at the darkness of the alley, freezes in spirit, and an invisible horror approaches, and a little more and he will show Rick his ugly, impossible face.
Rick starts shooting.
He suddenly realizes, with the despair of the doomed, that he will not have time to reload the pistol.
The flashes of shots are unable to illuminate the deadly darkness.



                                          *******                                       *******



A red light came on at the traffic light. Rick stopped the car next to a white, shiny new varnish, bus, watched as hurried pedestrians stepped onto the crosswalk in the morning.
Guy, lounging in his seat, gazed sullenly at his knees, his cap, pushed to the back of his head, revealed his bulging, sweaty forehead.
Rick was silent.
He thought about the incident in Maple Square yesterday.
There are no such dolls that met him last night. It's impossible. Maybe he went crazy, became one of the psychos? What about? It happens that a person lives for himself, lives, and then something breaks in his head and he runs down the street shouting "fire, fire", although there is no fire. No, it was a red lantern, just a red one, damn it, and if he went crazy, then this lantern, so that he burst, must be red!
He slowly lit a cigarette, tried to maintain attention, watching the road in front of their car.
Okay, let's say.
Okay, crazy.
Yeah.And what to do, people are going crazy ?!
This bruise is on his arm. Let the bruise. Maybe he, with his broken imagination, invented these dolls for himself, scared himself, and then, himself, inflicted this injury on himself?
Rick looked towards Guy.
He, leaning back in his seat, looked aimlessly down at his plump knees, his gaze expressed nothing.
	 - I want to ask you something, Guy,- said Rick.
	 - Uh-huh.
	 - Have you ever noticed that I behave, somehow not normal?
	 - We all have weirdness. Stop at the corner of the block?
	 - I’m not talking about that.- Rick hesitated and said.- Do I look like a psycho?
Guy came to life, he turned his head towards Rick.
	 - A psycho?- He asked curiously.- Did Dick tell you that?
Rick chuckled.
	 - My friend, I have noticed strange things behind you for a long time, - Guy's gaze brightened.- - What? Do you talk at night? Or are you peeing in your sleep?
Guy's belly shook, the buttons of his uniform shirt cutting menacingly into his buttonholes.
	 - Yes, sleepwalker, I walked a couple of times on the ceiling.
Guy's face gradually took on an expression of concern, the laughter stopped, his eyes looked at Rick seriously:
	 - Tell me.
	 - There is nothing to tell. Just asked. Do I look like a psycho?
	 - Did not notice. With you, everything seems to be always fine. Something happened?
Rick didn't answer right away. He watched the last pedestrians rush to cross the road at the crosswalk, drummed his fingers on the steering wheel, and said:
	 - Nightmares. I started having nightmares.
	 - Nightmares? Is that all?
	 - And that's all.
Guy got bored.
	 - Just think, nightmares. I thought it was something serious! Go!
Rick drove down the first lane of the road, turned right at the intersection, and pulled up beside a squat, two-story red brick building. He muffled the engine.
Guy fidgeted, moved, opened his door and, groaning, began to climb out of the car.
	 - I'll be right back.
Rick watched through the side window as Guy waddled to a powerful, wooden door, above which was a sign in the form of a curved oak leaf, with yellow letters in words - “Snack-bar. Under an oak tree. "
He knew that Guy would be back in a few minutes - he would go to the diner, and the bartender at the counter, recognizing him, would immediately silently hide in the back door, behind a showcase with bottles, and Guy would also silently follow him, where a glass of vodka was waiting for him and an uncomplicated snack.
This happened to him rarely - once, twice a month, he never got into the trash, his visits to the tavern did not interfere with his work, and Rick looked at all this "through his fingers."
Today is the last day before two days off, the week passed relatively calmly, except for the pickpocket-guest performer who was stabbed to death on their site. Besides, they were on a call to a domestic brawl at a familiar address, for the umpteenth time in the past week. The day promised to pass without incident.
At least the morning was calm.
Rick gently touched his right hand - under the sleeve of his blue shirt there was a huge bruise, painted with an iodine net, and every movement of his hand brought him sharp pain.
He got out of the car, slammed the driver's door and followed Guy.
The snack-bar smelled as usual in such establishments - fumes and tobacco. A dozen small tables in a small hall, with walls lined with wooden slats, were empty, except for one visitor in a crumpled green shirt, brown, similarly crumpled trousers, and gray, trampled shoes. The visitor stood at the bar, he was drinking from a mug of local swill and at the sight of Rick, his puffy face showed a kind of respect.
Rick walked through the hall and stepped behind the door covered with stickers with famous actresses, and ended up in the kitchen, where he found Guy, who was about to leave, and the old bartender, whose eyes were full of understanding.
The bartender's name was Lumik, he was thin, of medium height, in an old, ripe plum-colored sports suit, over which he was wearing a starched, shining white robe.
Sunlight shone brightly on a pristine table by the window, covered with cheap oilcloth with variegated flowers, a gas stove and a pile of pots and plates in a large enamel sink.
	 - Hi Lum.- Rick and the bartender shook hands.- Do you keep poisoning the cops with your booze?
	 - Lieutenant, I have everything of the highest grade! - Lumik smiled broadly at Rick's with his sad smile. - I would not offer you any rubbish. All the more so for you. What about you? Want to join too?
	 - What are you doing?- Guy looked at Rick with undisguised surprise.
	 - Lum, throw me a beer if you can.
	 - Always glad to see you, gentlemen.
	 - What are you doing?- Guy was taken aback.
	 - What am I doing?- Rick watched as old Lumik, with clear movements of his bony hands, filled a glass mug with a frothy drink, holding it under a humped tap protruding from a pot-bellied barrel tightened with iron hoops.- - Lum, haven't seen each other for a long time. How is your wife, how are your daughters?
	 - Everything is all right. The eldest one got married and now I must also support her husband, a parasite. I hope that I will be lucky with my grandchildren.
Rick smiled, took a mug from him and drank half of it at once. He drank in big gulps, holding the mug in his left hand and sticking out his little finger.
	 - Is your son-in-law at least not violent?
	 - Not. He is a quiet rogue who does not like to work. I listen to their bickering all day. How are you doing? I see mister sub-lieutenant began to lose weight.
Guy embarrassedly stroked his belly and said:
	 - A lot of work, Lum. We run like hounds. No time to eat.
	 - Yeah. - Lumik watched as Rick finished his beer, shook his head and took an empty mug from him.- Repeat?
	 - No thanks. If there is any problem, Lum …
	 - Mister lieutenant, what problems can I have after that story? The muddy types are now bypassing my place. If it were not for you, then it would not have been me, not daughters, not my wife …
	 - We showed them who is the law!- Guy said, and sipped again from his glass mug, beads of sweat glistening on his little nose.
	 - Yes. - Rick grinned. - We then, felt these guys for the udder.
After a couple of minutes, Rick and Guy got into the police car.
The motor roared.
Suddenly, the red radio light on the dashboard came to life and a disgusting, high-pitched squeak escaped from the speaker from Guy's side.
Guy flipped a shiny switch under the glowing red lamp and picked up the microphone.
Added to the engine noise was the crackle and noise of radio interference.
	 - Third crew, I'm listening.
	 - Guy, where are you hanging around? Why didn't they answer?- Dick School's voice broke into a cry.- They called a second time. The neighbors heard the sound of a shot. The second car has already left.


                                             *******                                    *******


                                                                    Chapter ten.


                                                               "He's not like that."

The usual entrance of a typical, brick five-story building from social slums, met them for a long time not whitewashed walls - scratched with obscene curses, the smell of urine and chippings on the concrete steps of narrow stairs. Through the dusty window on the flight of stairs a dull morning light poured.
They ran to the fourth floor - Guy ran first, followed by Rick. In spite of his fullness, Guy moved swiftly and quickly, unlike Rick - Rick got to the staircase of the fourth floor puffing like a locomotive, blood pounding in his temples, his heart sank in elastic jerks, it seemed to him that a little more, and his the chest will burst like a steam boiler.
Dark corridor to the right, Rick tripped over some boxes and bumped into a cast-iron bathtub set against the wall. His right knee responded with wild pain. In a couple of seconds he was already standing near the slightly open door to apartment number 31, holding a pistol in his right hand.
His eyes slowly accustomed to the semi-darkness of the corridor, he looked into the light crack of the slightly open door - there in the hallway, on a felt rug, peeped out a lonely - trampled and dirty black shoe, with a blunt nose bent upwards. The edge of an oval mirror was visible hanging from a green, painted wall.
Rick looked at Guy standing opposite him, who nodded his head, raised his pistol.
A distinct, male voice came from a crack in the door:
	 - Bitch, damn bitch! - the man was drunk and on edge. - You slept with him. With him, with this snotter, I know. Bitch, bitch …
He was echoed by a soft female cry, interspersed with slurred speech. Rick heard the words spoken by a woman invisible from here:
	 - Please, Noor, don't …
	 - Do not? Do not? I will kill you and you will die in your shit. Bitch. What are you, bitch! And then I'll follow his head! …
The police's stood on opposite sides of the door. Deathly silence reigned in the dark corridor. Rick had no doubt that the neighbors were hiding in their apartments, someone, with their ear pressed to their door, was waiting for a denouement.
He shouted:
	 - Police! Drop the gun and …
Two shots, one after the other, rang out in the apartment, and from the wooden door, at the level of Rick's head, chips splashed, two holes lit up with street light.
	 - Shit!- Guy pressed his back against the wall.
	 - Drop the gun. Police!
From a crack in the door, a gunpowder smoke blew, and a woman squeal rang in the apartment.
A shot rang out.
Then two more.
And that's all.
Rick heard dry, metallic clicks coming to him.
	 - It's empty!
	 - Rick, stop!
Rick threw himself at the door like a bull, flung it open with a blow of his right shoulder and flew into the brightly lit, narrow hallway. Seconds stretched like thickened jelly, he saw an open door on the left, leading into a room, and another, behind which was a tiny kitchenette, with a heap of dishes on a small table. The man stood right in front of Rick, young and large, the shock of curly, brown hair on his head like a disheveled washcloth. He leaned back against the wall, his black, wide underpants slid down a little, and his white T-shirt lifted up, exposing his flat, hairy belly. Rick's gaze froze on his left hand, he was holding a gleaming nickel, eight-round “Fock”, barrel down, and with the fingers of his right hand the man was trying to insert a yellow cartridge into the barrel of the pistol. A box of cartridges lay at his bare feet.
Rick knocked the pistol out of the man with a blow of his left hand and poked it with the barrel of his "Merk 9" up his stomach, pressed it against the wall. Dropping the pistol, the man butted Rick in the nose with his forehead with his head - Rick's cap flew to the floor, and everything floated in his eyes, but he continued to press the enemy against the wall, pressing on him with his chest.
And then, from somewhere to the left, Guy's hand flashed, with a direct blow to the jaw, he knocked the intoxicated consciousness out of the man, and he began to slowly sink to the floor.
While Rick was picking up the landlord's weapon from the floor, Guy quickly handcuffed him. Without ceremony, he turned him face down and, crushing his back with his powerful knee, twisted his arms.
A trickle of blood ran down Rick's chin, and crimson stains darkened on his uniform shirt.
	 - Shit.- Rick holstered his pistol, put the man’s pistol in the pocket of his trousers, pinched his nose with the fingers of his left hand.-Son of a bitch,- Rick's voice sounded nasal.
Guy laughed.
In the room, between a double bed and a cheap sideboard, a young brunette woman with short hair and an elongated, tear-stained face was sitting right on the floor. The woman's lower lip was swollen, giving her a capricious look, the cheek under her right eye turned blue. The woman squeezed her left leg above the knee with her hands - blood was flowing between her fingers, and a raised, cotton dressing gown, light beige, in yellow, large "polka dots", bared her round thighs.
	 - Lie down, - Rick heard from the hallway, Guy's grumbling voice. - I'll break your neck.
It took Rick about five minutes to bandage the woman's shot leg. Without thinking twice, he tore off a narrow strip from the sheet, then helped the woman get onto the bed. While he was helping the landlady, the blood from his nose wetted his neck and shirt collar. Sniffing, he reached into his trouser pocket to look for a handkerchief.
	 - What is your name?
	 - Is he alive ... alive?- The woman was shaking, she was sobbing, and tears were streaming down her face.
“What's your name?” Rick repeated his question.
	 - Shiril Das. This is my husband, Norismek Das. Will it be okay with him?
Rick silently looked at her face, swollen from beatings and tears.
	 - He's not ... not like that.
	 - And what is he? - Rick looked into her reddened eyes, in which a haunted expression of hope was frozen, he thought that also failed suicides are climbing again into the noose, and they also have hope - their own, desperate, terrible.
And everything that was happening in this ordinary apartment now reminded him of an event almost two years ago. They came to an ordinary call, for an ordinary reason - a domestic brawl, and he did not immediately recognize the owner of a chic, two-story mansion. It was Laina.
Laina Dots.
With a bruised, swollen nose and a long-sleeved crimson dress torn on the shoulder, she stood with her back against the wall, tear-stained and barefoot, her dark eyes were wide open and there were barely suppressed tears. Rick tried to interrogate her about what had happened, and she was silent, looking at her husband, who had suddenly fallen asleep, in a strong intoxication, and suddenly said:
	 - He's not like that.
"He's not like that."
Rick remembered Laina, looked at the tear-stained, wounded woman on the bed, and sympathy and irritation struggled painfully in him.
The year before last, Laina's husband went to swim in the river with his friends and, as usual with drunken swimmers, drowned.
Rick sometimes thought, looking at Laina's face, when she slept sweetly, putting her hand under her cheek, quiet and peaceful, as if thinking about something.
What feelings did she have to feel for her drowned husband, when the drunken and mocking husband selflessly beat her on the face, to the point of blood, to the fall?
Why didn't she leave?
Did she love him?
And the next question, a piercing, sharp one, arose from Rick, does she love him as well as she once loved and endured her husband, who was distraught with drunkenness?
"He's not like that."
What is he like?
There was a sound of approaching footfall.
	 - Hi Guy. What? Is that all already? Dead body? BUT...
Rick turned his head towards the door - an overweight, about forty years old, policeman of average height entered the room. Light bangs of hair protruded from under the visor of his uniform cap.
Sub-lieutenant Lo Chez from the fifth section. Guy peeked out from behind him.
	 - Hi Rick. Injured?- Lo winked at him with his right eye.
	 - Hi.- Rick and Lo shook hands.- Not the worst.- Rick began to wipe the blood off his face with a handkerchief.
	 - Good afternoon, lieutenant. - The tightly built sergeant greeted Rick from the hallway - he did not squeeze between Guy and the doorframe - he loomed behind Guy like a ghost.
Rick could not remember his name and answered simply:
	 - Hello. Lo, take her to the hospital - bullet wound in the leg... We'll take the detainee to the headquarters.
	 - Attempted murder of a policeman,- Lo nodded knowingly.- Door. Did he shoot you?
Rick didn't answer.
	 - Will they jail him? He's not like that! When sober, he's good ...- The woman looked, then at Rick, then at Lo.
"He is good".
As if she had not been on the verge of death just a few minutes ago, as if in this situation there was still some way out for her and her hope.

The second half of the day flooded the city with the heat of a dazzling sun, it seemed that the whole Firmness was heated and melted from its heat, and if it were not for the light, salutary breeze, the torment would have been completely unbearable.
The air trembled over the asphalt road.
Rick drove along luminous Prospect, Guy sat without his cap, in a sweat-soaked shirt, reading a cheap rag, running along the typographical lines with his thick index finger, a transparent bead of sweat hanging on the tip of his massive nose.
For several minutes they had been dragging behind a heavy, rumbling truck, swallowing its dust and soot, in the second lane of the road, opposite the truck, a school orange bus was moving, with a large sign on the back window - “children”. Little passengers of the bus crouched to the rear window of the cabin, looked at the road and talked about something merrily. A boy, about ten years old, was showing his tongue to Rick's and making faces.
	 - I don’t know,- Guy muttered and coughed.- Of course it is ... Hmm.
They spent a lot of time in the city police department. Rick issued documents for the surrender of the arrested person and his weapons, then wrote a report, waited for a long time for the secretary, who, as he was told, "will be there soon." The secretary is a young girl, a tall blonde, and already in the rank of a police lieutenant, appeared an hour after lunch, sweetly informed Rick that he should wait a little, and disappeared into her office.
Rick waited another forty minutes, contemplating the dull walls of the corridor, after which he simply entered her office, thereby interrupting her, without any doubt, an interesting and exciting conversation on the phone, threw his papers on the table in front of the secretary and left.
On the wall in the vestibule, in front of the wide staircase to the second floor, he stood for a short while, examining a large portrait of his grandfather, Sklim Yark, painted with oil paint on canvas.
He looked at the face that once seemed to him to be family, peered into the coarse, courageous features, and now he saw in them a stranger, a stranger to him. The portrait of a man, about forty-five, in an old white caste police uniform hanging here in the city police headquarters, had nothing to do with the pencil drawing that was now hiding in a notebook Rick had buried underground in the forest.
Two different faces, two different people.
Fake.
Rick looked and thought that, in principle, it was not so difficult to deceive the public, especially if a lot of time had passed after the hidden events.
Distortion of evidence.
And the public has nothing to do with this.
Guy returned just as Rick finally got rid of the drunk shooter's papers and, standing on the front staircase near the tall marble columns, was lighting a cigarette. Now, looking in front of the car at the smoky rear of the truck, he thought that someone for lieutenant's shoulder straps did not need to walk under bullets and look into the eyes of frightened, wounded women who were madly in love with their abnormal husbands. And, what if half of the city police department could be dispersed to hell, then order in the city would not have collapsed from this.
While he was going about his business, bypassing the control rooms, Guy met his old acquaintance, Chick Derba, a forty-five-year-old, balding fat man, with sergeant's stripes, and they went somewhere to dinner.
Now they were heading to their area and Rick was in a lousy mood - his nose was swollen and sore, and the blood stains on his shirt remained, despite all Rick's efforts to clean them in the men's room, standing by the sink and occasionally contemplating his reflection in the mirror.
From the speakers sounded the voice of the announcer of the radio program "Rest and Tourism" - a nasty, sugary voice of a liar, he reported on the "fabulous prospects" of recreation on the southern coast of Warm Cape, namely in a small town with the loud name Falcon Mountain. Rick had been in those places for a long time, and he saw nothing fabulous, except fabulous prices.
	 - Listen to what they write here! This is interesting. - Guy raised his voice. - According to our correspondent, the operator of the Eastern Radio Laboratory has detected strange signals coming from deep space! Rick, are you listening?
	 - From space.
	 - According to the operator, the signals that he detected are most likely of artificial origin, and do not come from distant stars, but much closer to us! He claims that the source of these mysterious signals is located somewhere on the outskirts of our star system, and most likely approaching us. He cannot yet confirm this with full confidence, but promises to give more solid explanations for the mysterious signal after a while. You heard?!
	 - What can he not say? That the signal is artificial or that it is near? Scribblers, their mother. They cannot formulate their thought correctly and clearly!
There was a mute pause, and Rick glanced sideways at the silent partner. Guy looked at him with wide eyes and his expression was shocked:
	 - Are you listening?
	 - I'm not deaf.
Guy said nothing for a minute, and then he said:
	 - Here's what I think, Rick …
The school bus went ahead and Rick took the police car to the second row to finally overtake the ill-fated truck.
	 - What if it's a ship? An alien ship? The data from the radio laboratory is not the experience of onlookers in a haunted house! The guys there are serious.
	 - Suppose that this article is true and, that indeed, some signal has been detected. Artificial. Let's assume. I will not even argue with the fact that a ship from another world is moving in our direction. So be it. What do we have from this, Guy?
	 - That is, how is it, what? A lot of things! They will show up, all these stupid arguments about our loneliness in space will end, and a new era will begin. Rick, a new era!
	 - Nothing will happen.
	 - I.e?
	 - How do you imagine it? Well, for example.
	 - Well, how, how ... Exchange of knowledge, culture.
	 - Yeah. - Rick grinned, looking at the road. - We give them the secret of the motor from our car, - he tapped his hand on the steering wheel. - And they give us the blueprints of their ship. Oh yes. We also tell funny anecdotes.
	 - You're oversimplifying everything.
	 - Of course, I'm simplifying. - Rick paused a little. - You know what will happen? I do not presume to assert with an absolute guarantee, but it seems to me that even if they arrive, you and I will not know about it, Guy.
	 - Like this? The aliens will not hide in the bushes? - He laughed deafeningly, something creaked in his throat and Guy coughed violently, spat in the open side window. - Maybe we will get on the ship with them on an excursion. Huh, Rick? Would you like to get on an alien ship?
Alien ship.
He remembered the words, unknown to him, "grandmother Tosya's", written in an old, faded notebook.
"... I was going to fly away with the aliens, but I couldn't."
"... Sklim was killed at the police station, he was shot."
For a moment Rick saw in his memory the dead mask of a doll standing in front of him, there, on the half-dark path of the square.
“We go where we need to. Free. Always..."
For a few seconds he seemed to have fallen out of reality, saw and heard that terrible doll, experienced an echo of horror, which then flooded his entire being.
"- Don't play with us …"
	 - Rick!
Guy's shout returned him to reality - the car deviated strongly to the left and drove half of its body into the oncoming lane. Rick turned the steering wheel to the right and the car swerved back into its lane.
	 - What's the matter? Are you overheated?
	 - I thought. This heat ... We talked ... talked …
	 - About aliens, Rick. Are you sure everything is all right?
	 - About the aliens Guy, if they land on the Firmness, they will most likely be captured or killed. Our fathers-commanders used to take everything without giving anything in return.
	 - Aliens? Ha! Yes, our "fathers" have little guts for that. Capture the aliens …
	 - Our commanders have little strength, yes.- Rick looked briefly into Guy's face and suddenly very much wanted to tell him about everything - about talking dolls, about the woman who died from the bus, and about that notebook that he buried in the woods outside the city.- We'll never know about them, Guy. Never.
After passing the Twenty-eighth Block, Rick drove safely to the police station, and when the car stopped on the landing in front of the porch, he turned off the engine.
	 - There is an hour and a half left until the end of the working day. - Guy obviously did not want to get out of the car, his big palms were neatly folding and smoothing the newspaper he had just read. - Dick, he can drive us to "loom" again.
	 - For today, the "beacon" went out, Guy. - Rick slapped him on the rounded, damp with sweat, shoulder. - Get out, officer, more cheerful face.
Rick grabbed the leather folder from the couch behind him and climbed out into the sunlight.
Guy, groaning warming up in front of the car, moved his stomach to the left and to the right.
	 - Can we move to me, while away the evening with a bottle? Huh, Rick? I have beef cutlets today.- He pointedly pointed his index finger into the sky.
	 - Another time, buddy. Today Laina has a day off, we want to walk a little.


                                            *******                                       *******


He knew at once that they had come for him.
Rick just turned the corner and came out onto River Lane - on both sides of the narrow asphalt sidewalk, the brick walls of five-story buildings, still the old post-war building, towered. All rags were dried on clotheslines stretched over narrow balconies.
The evening sun shone in his face.
The car gently taxied out of the road and, turning into an alley, rolled with the engine off, a little further than Rick, and froze.
An ordinary "Peg Steg" passenger car is brown, with a metal roof and a spare wheel on the boot lid.
The sun shone on her recently washed polish.
Only her number was carefully smeared with mud.
Rick continued to walk forward, towards the waiting car, and already knew that the people in the car were waiting for him. A certain feeling of apprehension stung him with anxiety, inexplicable, but very familiar to him. This happened to Rick sometimes. He remembered how he and the guys from the police station once went to arrest a couple of robbers on tour and, making his way along the unlit corridor of an abandoned house, inexplicably suddenly realized that there was someone armed behind the next door …
The front passenger door of the car opened and a middle-aged, well-built man in a well-fitted brown suit and black shoes climbed out onto the sidewalk. The man was wearing a hat in a gray-black check.
Rick continued to move in the same direction, showing no attention to the car and the man who was clearly waiting for him.
An ordinary, living person, not a doll.
Rick gave him an indifferent glance and noted the novelty of the stranger's suit, and the same novelty of his hat, as if he had just bought his clothes at the nearest department store. The man's boots were immaculately clean.
	 - Lieutenant Rickslem Yark, I suppose?- The man's voice was deep and even, he said it in a friendly and quiet voice to Rick, who was already passing by.
Rick stopped, wearily, indifferently looked at the stranger's face and uttered the phrase he had just prepared:
	 - Do we know each other?
	 - No, inspector, we do not know each other, - the man smiled and continued to look into Rick's face with a calm, studying look. - I have a couple of questions for you, inspector, we could discuss them in my car. Oh, yes, - the man seemed to catch himself and reached into the inner pocket of his brand new jacket, the white shirt under the jacket glowed with bright whiteness. He showed Rick his ID with three gold embossed letters - FDI.
Federal Department of Inquiry.
Rick saw on the ID a black and white photograph of the stranger, the round, blue seal of the Inquiry Department, and the signature of the supervisor. Judging by what was written on this certificate, the man's name was Avs Hul, and he bore the rank of major.
Rick nodded, making it clear that he knew who he was talking to.
Avs Hul put his ID back into his inside jacket pocket and casually opened the back door of the car, said:
	 - Sit down, Inspector. It does not take much time.
Rick climbed onto the leather sofa, closed the door behind him and tried to express his displeasure on his face.
In the driver's seat there was a man in exactly the same suit as on Avs Hul. A little younger than his partner, with the long, clean-shaven face of a bank clerk.
He just nodded to Rick, giving him a sidelong glance.
Avs, sitting in the front seat, turned to Rick.
	 - The lieutenant, the case of which I want to tell you, does not tolerate publicity.
	 - Listen, Major. If you are about the detention of this snotter, the nephew of the mayor, then everything is fine with him. He was released on a call from the lieutenant colonel.
	 - The mayor's nephew? What happened to him?- Avs smiled amiably at Rick's, like an old friend.
	 - I detained him.
The major seemed to laugh sincerely, his partner chuckled restrainedly as he looked straight ahead through the windshield of the car.
	 - No, no, Inspector. We have no idea about the mayor's brat. Our department does not deal with snotters. No, no.- He opened the black, leather folder, which he put on his lap.
	 - Then I have no idea how I can be of service to you, Major.
	 - We're looking for a woman. It would be more accurate to say - not her ... Do you recognize her, Lieutenant? - He handed Rick a photograph, which depicted the very woman who gave Rick the alien's notebook.
Taking the photograph in hand, Rick noticed the major staring intently at his face. Rick peered at the photo for a minute, then handed it to Avs, with the words:
	 - I can't be sure, but her face looks familiar to me.
Rick tried to speak calmly, even with some indifference.
Answering Avs, he almost said "this face", but said "her face". "This face" - so they say about the dead, when they know that the said person is dead. A small and seemingly insignificant detail, but he knew very well from his work with the detainees that it was precisely from such details that court verdicts consist.
	 - You haven’t met her or can’t remember her, Lieutenant?- Believe me, this is very important for us.
The interior of the car smelled of expensive tobacco.
	 - Her face looks familiar to me. Maybe I've already met her somewhere. Not sure. What did she do? Preparing an assassination attempt on Mr. President?
	 - Worse,- the major smiled at Rick's, the smile of older brother.- We've been looking for her for a long time, but we can't find her. She has some thing, a very important thing, Lieutenant, and we really need this thing.
	 - Hmm. FDI put her on the wanted list?
	 - Not. This is an extremely delicate matter. We do not want publicity.
	 - I don’t understand, Major, what do you want from me? Do you want me to start looking for her?
	 - And you are a joker, Inspector. No, they will find her without you. My question is about something else. Are you sure you don't know her?
	 - I'm not a sclerotic.
	 - And if you think about it? Every little thing is important to us. And don't be so nervous. Believe us, we are on duty just like you and we pull our wagon.
"Pull our wagon".
Major, let me look at the photo again,- Rick said with the air of an effort to overcome his irritation, took the photo handed to him and peered at it for a long time.
The woman was looking somewhere to her right. She stood in the street, but Rick did not recognize the place where the picture was taken, her light dress froze at the moment when a gust of wind flew over her. The woman's jet-black hair, twisted into a tight knot at the back of her head, resembled a child's knitted cap. The face is alarmed, the lips are tightly compressed and turned into a narrow, gray strip.
Rick looked at the photo and remembered a photo where the same woman, but already dead, lies on the asphalt, in her blood.
It is possible that the driver of this particular car, the guy who is now sitting behind the steering wheel, and whose face reminded Rick of the face of some bank clerk, easily and simply knocked her to death by running over her with this car.
He handed the photo back to the major, said with a touch of regret in his voice:
	 - No, I don't know her. That's absolutely certain, Major.
Rick did not notice the expression of disappointment on the Major's face, he simply took the photograph from his hand and said with a light, friendly smile:
	 - Sorry, very sorry inspector. You cannot imagine how we counted on you.
	 - It happens.
	 - It happens. Then I dare not detain you any longer, Lieutenant.
Rick nodded in return, got out of the car and, straightening the belt of his uniform trousers as he walked, walked slowly down the alley towards Eighteenth Street.
Behind him there was no sound of the starting engine of the car, he felt the eyes of its passengers on his back, and he really wanted to look back and look, but Rick continued walking, looking in front of him, calmly lit a cigarette from a gasoline lighter and, crossing the roadway, turned left being among the crowd of pedestrians.
"We were counting on you."
He understood that if the agents of the Department of Inquiry knew for sure that the woman had given him the notebook, the conversation would have been different, and it would have taken place much earlier.
Plus, Rick wasn’t sure if the ID that Avs Hul showed him was not a fake. He could be from the Department of Justice and from military intelligence, or from any secret government service, about which there are many legends lately.
They also could not have known about his visit to the station in the storage room, for the notebook.
What else?
Rick walked along the sidewalk, examining the window of the nearest store, next to which, next to which, two movers in gray, dirty aprons were arguing about something, the well-groomed trees planted along the road cast long, thick shadows, and the clean glass windows blinded him with the reflection of the setting sun …
They came to him because they knew about the contents of the notebook.
Portrait of grandfather, portrait of Sklim Yark.
Here's the thing.
The woman was run over next to a bus stop where she got off the bus where she met Rick. They just found out, maybe they traced him the route of his way home, and they came to the conclusion that Rick might have been on that bus, and this woman might have passed the notebook to him.
Could be.
It might not have been.
He did not always take a bus home from work, and there were two bus routes to his house, and the choice was different.
They are not sure.
They do not know.
Rick thought the notebook would be best hidden. The place where he buried it, Rick chose not by chance. A year ago, he, Guy and Abrom Chloe went out of town for barbecue. They stayed overnight, fished and drank the hell out of vodka. Abrom began firing a pistol at the bushes, Guy took his weapon away from him. All three returned to work with a severe hangover, and Abrom also with a bruise on his cheekbone.
The location was good, and Rick was attracted by the fact that during their stay there he had not noticed a single sign of an outsider presence. But now he was filled with doubts.
Could FDI agents have come to that place in search of a notebook?
What is the likelihood of this happening?
Rick was nervous. He began to realize that for the first time in his life he thought of himself as a criminal.
"It happens".


                                               *******                                   *******


                                                                     Chapter two.


                                                         Little Doddy goes hunting.


Rick signed at the end of the protocol, opened a drawer to his left and took out a box with a seal.
	 - I thought he was a tough nut to crack,- Abrom standing in front of him yawned.- Then he began to sing. And he remembered about his mother - he wanted a “frank confession”. Shit.
Rick blotted the brass seal on an ink-soaked felt blotter and carefully attached it after his signature. I looked critically at the print on the sheet - it turned out well, the print was printed all and without blots.
	 - He wants too much. He robbed and beat up an old woman-mother. Shit.
He returned the seal to the table, to its original place, and handed Abrom a sheet of paper:
	 - Here you go. Give it to Dick's and get on with the theft case.
	 - Rick, can you entrust Mirol's with the theft case, let him run around, young? Each hijacking is like a thorn in …
	 - Mirol is loaded to capacity. Move to Dick, old man.
Abrom muttered something under his breath with displeasure and, taking the protocol, left Rick's office.
The morning started off well.
He stretched in his chair, looked out the wide open window. There, in the parking lot, standing next to a police car, Fru Ool and Shock Lau were arguing about something, while the sergeant grinned in the most inappropriate way in a conversation with an officer, his narrow mustache bristling like a cat.
Rick took a sip of the already cooled tea from his iron mug, and took out a pack of cigarettes from the breast pocket of his shirt. From the window came the sounds of cars passing along the street, rare horns croaked, hoarsely and demandingly. A light, fresh wind blew, diluting the musty atmosphere of the office with its morning freshness.
A plywood radio box attached to the wall was silent.
Rick was just lighting a gas lighter when Duk Shopeler came through the door. The expert's bald head gleamed dullly on the street morning light.
	 - Get up, let's go- Dick calls everyone to him.
	 - Thunder and lightning again?
	 - I do not know. Says he got a call from the department. Something very important.
	 - Are we all in place?
	 - Everything. And they're not even hungover.- Duk chuckled.
	 - So the prize will be cut again.


                                             *******                                   *******


	 - Why exactly a maniac?- Abrom stared into the face of Dick School, who was sitting at his desk.
The captain's office was stuffy and smoky, and the window overlooking the park was tightly closed, a pile of crumpled cigarette butts was piled up in the ashtray.
	 - That’s what the Office thinks,- Dick replied grimly.
He folded his arms over his chest and, leaning back in an upholstered chair, looked in turn at all those present in the office.
	 - It hasn’t happened for a long time,- said Duk, who was standing at the window.
Dick School stared at him, his black eyes flashing.
	 - So go to the office and bring a preliminary report. This case has come to the fore, the bastard must be caught as soon as possible. I spoke to the major. This is a matter of paramount importance!
	 - I'll take Mirol's car, - Duk looked at the young policeman, Mirol nodded to him. - I don't think I'll be back soon.


                                           *******                                  *******


Duk Shopeler came back for lunch.
Holding in his right hand a black leather folder, and in his left a rumpled gray hat, he silently walked into the captain's office. Twenty minutes later, Duk looked out of Dick School's office into the "corral" and called:
	 - Come on in. Everything. Rick, get the sergeants.
A few minutes later, all the police officers from their station, with the exception of Mirol's and Tresm's Pei, who were now on duty, crammed into the modest space of the captain's office.
Rick and Abrom sat in the only two chairs, Guy and Sergeant Shock Lau stood at the window, Frou Ool sat to the right of Dick's desk, and Sergeant Mar Klay and Duk Shopeler stood to the left of the table.
	 - We can start,- the captain muttered.
Shopeler was silent for a minute, holding an open folder in his hands, he was reading something in it, then he began to say:
	 - This is a preliminary report from a group of experts who visited the crime scene. An hour before dawn, the corpse of Sergeant Glos Fau, from the tenth precinct, was found in the park on South Boulevard. The body was found by a young couple, wandered into the bushes and saw it. - Duk took out a large photograph from the folder and handed it to Sergeant Klai, who was standing next to him. - Take turns.
Rick looked into Duk's face.
	 - And so, what is known at this moment. The sergeant was on duty at night, his booth is located at the intersection of East Fifth and Fourth Streets. How he ended up in the park is unknown. The time at which he left his post is also unknown.- Duk hesitated, said.- The police badge and his weapon were not found on him. Death occurred as a result of greater blood loss, although it may be that Fau died earlier, from painful shock. The index and thumb are missing on the right hand, they ... were amputated with an instrument similar to nippers, this is indicated by the nature of the damage to the bones and tissues. A dilettante without medical skills was operating. So experts say. The abdominal cavity was opened with a sharp object, most likely with a knife, and the liver and part of the intestine were removed. Judging by the nature of the injuries, they tried to rip off Fau's face, but they left him. Perhaps someone scared them away. Little evidence. There are three Eagle cigarette butts and one Iron Mountain Top cigarette butt, excellent in bite.- Duk tried to speak in a calm professional voice, he took out photos from the folder, one by one and gave them to the sergeant, who, having examined the picture, passed it to Guy.- There are traces of lipstick on the "Summit" cigarette. Also, next to the body, numerous shoe prints were found - from men's shoes of the forty-third and forty-fifth sizes, and from women's shoes of the thirty-fifth size. Also, next to the body, numerous shoe prints were found - from men's shoes of the forty-third and forty-fifth sizes, and from women's shoes of the thirty-fifth size.
	 - So, Madame Tiny, - muttered Abrom.
	 - Experts believe that it was she who cut Fau. - Duk looked at Abrom. - I think so too. They left a note. Here is a snapshot of her. "Hello caps, from Little Doddy." There is nothing else from the evidence. By the morning they promised to give a more complete report of the expert group.
Rick took the photograph from Abrom's hand.
The picture was taken from above and to the right of the body. The corpse was stripped to the waist, the uniform trousers slid from the hips to the pubis, blackened with blood, the open belly twisted to the left, and to the right, from the fish-like hole, with the edges sunken inward, the belly sagged like a deflated children's ball. He saw the intestines of the corpse, which looked like sausages falling out on the grass. Handing the photograph to Frou Ool, Rick could not take his eyes off the mutilated face of the deceased. 
	 - Is that all you have?- Asked Dick School.
	 - For now, yes.
	 - And so, guys. We have animals. Search in all directions, go around all the eateries on our site, interview the drunkards and prostitutes, maybe someone heard something, interrogate and check those who have recently been released from prison. Rick, pick up the entire file of our site, everyone who has been convicted of serious charges and is now released. Especially those who were imprisoned for resisting arrest, anyone who might have a motive. All women who come into our field of vision, with suitable characteristics, must be turned inside out! Duk, help Rik's. The vacation is over, boys. Dig the ground with your nose. We need to find these scum.
Everyone left the office.
Until the end of the working day, Rick and Duk sat in the archives of the precinct, picking out suspicious types of cards from the card index, stacking them in piles, giving some of the papers to Abrom, Guy and Frou. By the end of the day, Rick's eyes rippled from the abundance of photographs, it began to seem to him that everyone depicted on them looked like one face. 
	 - You got that, what?- Duk asked him, pointing to the even stacks of cards.
	 - Here those who were released a year ago, two, three, four, five. These are stabbing, these are small things. Here for resisting arrest. Little. There are seven suitable women, one half a year ago died. There are only three with the name Doddy. These,- he threw in front of Duk three cardboard cards with photographs of women glued to them.- Dodula Gremk, Dodistela Mireille and Dodiuba Feyh. I didn’t find anything else.
	 - Maybe we’ll hook someone.- Duk skeptically examined the table with the documents laid out, once again glanced at the photographs of the three suspected women, winced and said.- My dear mother, and after all someone is sleeping with such! Two imprisonment - stabbing and theft. ABOUT! She has a son.
Tresm Pei and Mirol Dar returned from duty and were immediately loaded with work. The selection of suspects ended only when it was already dark outside. There was not a single window in the smoky police archive room, and in order not to suffocate in its suffocating atmosphere, Duk kept the door open. In the corridor, voices could be heard coming from the "corral".
Sometimes Guy, Abrom or Mirol entered the archive, checked with what Duk and Rick had, wrote down what they needed for the investigation into notebooks, and again hid in the corridor.
Dick was absent from lunchtime - he left for the city police department and, returning after dark, immediately burst into the archive room.
	 - Well?
	 - Everything you need is here. - Rick nodded his head towards the table. - The guys will finish soon too. Here is a list of those we are interested in.
	 - Tomorrow we will take all the suspects to our cages, shake everyone. And more, guys. Be on the alert, keep weapons with you.
Before going home, Rick, Duk and Guy stopped on the porch of the police station and lit a cigarette. Everyone dispersed, except for Mirol, who remained on duty.
In the light of street lamps, the sleeping city became silent, the buses were still running, but there were almost no pedestrians, the sidewalks of the street were empty.
	 - The murder has already been reported on the radio.- Guy blew out a thick jet of smoke, which glowed dull in the light of the only lantern hanging under the canopy.- Tomorrow all the newspapers will raise a terrible howl.
Rick stared into the night, said:
	 - We will not have time for their howl tomorrow. Okay, guys, go home. Duk, do you know - the murdered man had a family?
	 - I do not know.
	 - Yeah, - Guy looked at both of them, threw his cigarette butt far out on the sidewalk and said. - And there is no need to catch flies with your nostrils. If you suspect something was wrong, then immediately shoot in the head.
	 - He was not a boy, Guy,- said Duk.- Anyone can blunder. Watch out guys - Doddy is out hunting.
	 - Yes, the guy suffered before he died.
	 - He was still alive when they took the guts out of him.- Duk spat over the porch railing and, adjusting his gray hat and not saying goodbye, went down the stairs and walked into the darkness.
Rick and Guy stared after him in silence.


                                              *******                                *******


The first interrogation, Rick began in the afternoon.
From the very morning, having split into carriages, all the police officers from their station drove to the addresses obtained from the archive and took those who were found to the station - the detention cells were overcrowded, there was a hubbub from many voices in the corridor, a drunken voice was yelling a song.
After the morning rain, the sun came out, the wet streets evaporated the suffocating heat, the weather was calm.
Rick was sitting at the table in his office, his shirt soaked in sweat, unbuttoned to the navel, he took off his tie, and threw his hat on the table, and it defiantly towered over an overflowing ashtray and a decanter of water.
	 - Chief, so I can go? - The detainee was sitting in front of Rick on a shaky stool, and on his unshaven face, a tortured expression of supplication was depicted.
He was a thin, tall man, in a wrinkled white shirt that had not been washed for a long time, and the same wrinkled dark brown trousers. He wore sneakers on his bare feet. Had no watch. The man's shaggy, large head, with an elongated nape and a low forehead, looked like a melon, his blond hair was yellow-orange, like the color of an unripe peach. He was 52 years old.
	 - I said everything as it is, - the detainee was sitting, handcuffed, and in order to pick his nose with a finger he had to raise both hands to his face. - Yes, at least ask the neighbors …
	 - I will ask.
	 - So you let me go, then?
	 - You’ll sit until tomorrow.- Rick finished with the scribble, put the scribbled sheets in a new, cardboard folder, and put it in a drawer of his desk, and said to him, with an official tone in his voice.- Pitts Gray, you are delaying until the circumstances you indicated are clarified.
	 - I'm not guilty of anything. Chief, I was released three years ago, I behave decently, I work …
	 - If you weren't sitting, you would be at home now.
	 - And what do you accuse me of?
	 - In killing a cop!- Rick snapped.
Pitts Gray could not find what to say, his mouth silently opened and closed, like a dumb fish, bulging, bright eyes, it seemed, were about to jump out of their sockets.
	 - Sergeant!
	 - Chief! I didn't kill a police officer!
	 - And what, you killed someone else?
	 - I?
	 - Sergeant!- Rick shouted at the top of his voice, and the door to the office immediately opened and Sergeant Shock Lau entered.
	 - Lock this one in a cage, and bring the next one here.
	 - I didn’t do anything, I didn’t kill anyone!
Rick wearily watched as Sergeant Lau pulled the detainee into the corridor, where he ran into Sergeant Tresm Payme, who was leading a loud, plump little man in a sports, beige suit - a traffic jam formed, both detainees collided with each other and Pei barked:
	 - Face the wall!
Rick got to his feet, poured water from a decanter into a glass, and drained it in one gulp. He left the table, went to the window and stared at the carriageway, where a line of cars was slowly crawling behind the bus.
Rick was breathing deeply, his back was numb and aching, his mouth formed, some kind of disgusting taste of sourness.
He spat out the window.
After a while, Pei returned, introducing a lanky, young guy, about twenty-five, in blue shorts and a sports T-shirt into the office. Rick was already waiting, sitting at his desk, and in front of him lay a new folder open, with several blank sheets of white paper. A fountain pen, stained with blue ink, stuck out of a glass inkwell.
Seating the guy on a stool, the sergeant glanced at Rick.
	 - I'll call you.
Pei went out into the corridor and closed the door behind him.
	 - Name and address,- Rick said shortly, taking a pen from an inkwell.
	 - Jessme Huyut. Thirty-first street, house nineteen, apartment seven. Can I find out why I was arrested?
Rick glanced at his notebook, where he wrote down a long list of suspects. Yeah. Jesm Huyut - Served five years for stabbing, was released early two years ago.
He looked into Jessma's face. The usual young face of a young, athletic guy, and his eyes are conducive to trust, and he is all kind of respectable and well-groomed. It's hard to imagine this with a bloody knife in hand. But there was a knife.
Rick was just about to ask the detainee his first question, when he heard a loud noise of voices from the corridor, overlapping all other noises in the corridor, and the door to his office opened again, and Dick School flew into it - hatless, black tie on the collar of his white shirt slid onto his left side, his bald head glistened with sweat, in crumpled, black, baggy trousers.
	 - Rick, take Guy and Duk, and fly to South Avenue. We have three corpses. Three, damn it, corpses! - And looking back, he shouted into the corridor. - Guy, Guy, drop it. Go with Rick ... Call Duk.



                                               *******                                     *******



Daylight penetrated the hall through large, light showcases, lined with wide shelves with all sorts of small things - the upper shelves were occupied by men's hats, on the lower shelves were motley ties, from the usual strict black to lurid, multi-colored. The short mannequins wore jackets and light, summer jackets. On the right, along the entire length of the wall, there was a counter covered with green velvet; on the left, on the wall, wall mirrors of various shapes and sizes were hung, in wooden, lacquered frames. In the wall, opposite the entrance to the haberdashery store, there were two doors, one open, leading to the utility room, the other closed, to the toilet room.
On the high ceiling, shining with new whitewash, there was a crystal chandelier in the form of a flower spreading its petals, its glass drops, decorations, cast bizarre, multi-colored reflections on the whiteness of the ceiling.
On the street in front of the entrance to the store, a crowd of onlookers gathered - about ten people, others approached them, and through the window one could see a lively conversation between them, supported by hand gestures and facial expressions.
Rick stood by the corpse, writing down the testimony of the elderly man who stood nearby in pencil in his notebook.
Guy and Duk were now at the counter.
	 - I’m telling you, inspector, I didn’t look at their faces,- the man was nervous, he kept stroking his white, dirty, greasy apron worn over a light shirt and light trousers. His work boots were blackened with fresh shoe polish on his feet, and he smelled strongly of fresh fish. The man's small, black eyes were watering. He was completely gray, his neatly combed hair shone with silver, his wrinkled face was clean shaven.- They drove up in a passenger car. It seems to be blue.
	 - What was the make of the car, remember?- Rick asked him.
	 - Not. She stood in the distance and almost with her back to me, and behind all the cars are the same.
	 - There were definitely three of them?
	 - Exactly. I had just let go of the buyer, and I was not busy with anything. I reviewed them. In principle, I don't care who came to whom. I just stood there. So I examined them. More precisely, there were three of them. My eyesight is no longer the same, I could not see their faces. Only in general terms. My shop is not far away, that's why I …
	 - What did they look like?
	 - Well ... Two are tall, probably the same height. About your height. And the third was puny and short. The boy, I guess.
"Boy."
Rick looked the man in the face, asked calmly:
	 - Could it be, woman? Girl?
	 - It is possible that it could be a girl. A car was blocking them. I think that it could very well be a young girl, - the man thought about something, and his gaze looked, somewhere above Rick's eyes. - Yes, it could be a girl. But then she has a very boyish figure. They say about such people, "No boobs, no ass" ... She is fragile.
	 - She's fragile. And what was her height?
	 - You shoulder-length - the elderly man tried not to look down at the corpse at his feet. - It was already by noon. I also thought that the guys are great, they even work at lunchtime. But you can't get them from the electricity company at the usual time.
	 - Why did you say - from the electricity company?
	 - Well, they were wearing such blue overalls as electricians. Ours are the same. From the electric company.
Rick stopped writing and leaned over the corpse.
	 - Rick! - Duk shouted to him from the counter. - Don't touch anything there!
Rick straightened up, straightened his cap, asked the man:
	 - How long do you think they were here?
	 - I dont know. Customers began to approach me and I completely started to spin. I didn't even notice how their car drove away.
It smelled of perfume and blood. Rick took a pack of cigarettes and a gasoline lighter from his trousers pocket, lit a cigarette for a long time, involuntarily trying to smoke everything around him with tobacco smoke.
	 - Do you live at the address you named?
	 - Yes. It's not that far from here. In general, I am very glad that I was allowed to take a shop on this street - and not far from my house ...
Guy came up to them - his face turned red, large drops of sweat ran down his face and accumulated on his round, powerful chin.
	 - Slaughterhouse. - Guy sniffed. - Did you call us?
	 - Yes, - the man answered, he still avoided looking at the corpse. - As soon as I saw, ... as I saw Mr. Shamshi, I immediately ran to the pharmacy on the street corner. There is a telephone.
	 - Did you know the murdered man?- Rick asked him.
	 - Yes. We always said hello in the morning. Sometimes we talked about nothing, just like that. Mr. Shamshi was a simple man and very sociable. And the day before yesterday he drove me home in his car.
Rick looked at the corpse again.
The murdered man was an elderly man, as gray-haired as this fishmonger. His white shirt, buttoned all the way to the collar, was crimson with blood leaking from a wide, cut wound in his flabby neck. The head of the dead man was turned to the right and Rick could see the place, stained with thickened blood, where the ear should be. The dead man's nostrils were cut by short cuts, and a bloody mass covered the entire lower half of his face. The eyes of the murdered old man, wide open, looked calmly without horror, and daylight was reflected in them.
Rick turned away.
	 - I finished there.- Duk suddenly appeared next to Rick, in his right hand he held his heavy bag, and with his left hand he was wiping the sweat from his face with a handkerchief. A camera hung around his neck.- Rick, step back, everyone. You will interfere with my work. Guy you stepped into the blood! Get away from here!
	 - Damn. - Guy jumped aside, began to wipe the sole of his boot on the plank floor.
	 - The boy died immediately. - Duk looked down at his feet, and placing the bag beside him, opened it. - A stab wound in the heart. The girl has three stab wounds - two in the left chest and one in the neck. I took prints from everyone, from the cash register too.
Rick stepped back to the window and said to the man in the apron:
	 - If we need you, we will contact you.
	 - I can go?
	 - Yes of course.
Rick watched as Duk took out a glass jar of black powder, napkins and a paper envelope from his suitcase, some iron tools glinting in the back of the suitcase.
	 - The chiefs from the department are about to arrive,- he said.
	 - Now reporters will drive up, this will be a circus. - Duk was looking for something in the back of the bag. - Newspapers will raise a real howl. That's for sure.
Rick walked to the end of the room, stepped over a mannequin with a man's black suit lying on the floor, walked around an overturned chair and, finding himself at the beginning of the green counter, where there was a fitting room curtained with a heavy, draped curtain, stopped beside her.
A child's leg in a gray sock and a leather, yellow sandal protruded from under the curtain.
Rick didn’t want to look again at what was behind the curtain - just one time was enough. He walked around the counter and approached the place where the cash register stood.
The entire copper surface of the cash register was covered with black dust from Duk's set, the niches of four narrow cabinets were empty, and they themselves were lying on the floor, small change was scattered in the same place - coins were lying under the counter, mixed with cash papers and checks.
To the left of the cash register, there was a sheet of writing paper on which someone had written with a chemical pencil, "hello to shorty May, from Doddy."
The note clearly bore two fingerprints, previously stained with blood.
Rick turned towards the dead girl.
She was lying in the far corner of the counter, young, in her early twenties, blond, in a pink, long sleeveless dress. Her round face, like the old man's, looked calm, and her eyes were closed, as if the girl were asleep. Her blood drenched the entire floor around her, and soaked the dress on her chest and abdomen.
	 - I'll go look for witnesses again, - said Guy, going up to the counter. - In broad daylight people are slaughtered like pigs, and no one saw anything!
	 - Go. - Rick looked from the dead girl to Guy, and said.- This Doddy is a real beast. They won't stop. Notes are being written. Shorty Mei doesn't like being called that.
	 - So Doddy’s ears will end up in his can of alcohol.- Guy spat on the floor.- I'll go.
Guy left, and Rick took out his lighter and lit a cigarette that had long gone out.
The light from the photo lamp flashed brightly, he heard the camera click - Duk began to change the disposable photo lamp, muttering something under his breath, his big gray hat slid down on the back of his naked head.
	 - I sent my girls to my wife’s sister today,- Duk said, not turning in the direction of Rick.- Away from here. And I think I did the right thing.
	 - The whole city won't leave, Duk. They lived and did not expect anything.
Duk didn't answer.
	 - They didn't expect anything,- Rick said.
Another car pulled up in the street next to their police car.
This is a group from the department.
Rick straightened his cap on his head and went to greet the newcomers.


                                               *******                                *******


The next day there was just one more double murder. In a workers' quarter in the north of Pacific Harbor, a china shop clerk was stabbed to death, along with a twenty-three-year-old son. And again the crime was perfect at about 12 noon. Two witnesses stated that they had seen a Daimig 10 car with mud-smeared numbers and three people dressed in blue uniforms as employees of the Starlight Electric Company. No shots or shouts, the criminals, as in the case of the murdered police sergeant, and the triple murder in the grocery store, acted with knives.
And again, a note left at the crime scene.
“Greetings to shorty May from Doddy. We're coming for your ears, you old piece of shit for the cops".
The newspapers raised a veritable hysteria, their headlines screaming:
"The police can't stop the maniacs."
"Who is next?"
"May's Crime Syndicate Challenged".
"The Nightmare of Quiet Harbor".
"The chief of police must resign."
"The police are unable to protect themselves and us."
Dick School was summoned to the city police department every morning and, returning from there, he looked like an abnormal - he shouted and demanded "results", personally went to interview witnesses, from whom the police had already shaken out everything they could see and hear.
In the evening, when the street lights had long turned on in the street and the daytime heat gave way to evening coolness, Captain Dick School went out of his office into the "corral" and, examining his subordinates with a gloomy look, asked:
	 - Rick, did you find out anything?
	 - There are forty-three owners of "Daymig 10" on our site. More than half were interviewed …
	 - Do you go after them on foot? Why are you working so slowly?
	 - Dick, don't get started. The guys had just finished all this running, we physically could not interview them all in one day!
Rick stood at the barrier dividing the common room into a corridor and the "corral" itself, his cap was lying on Guy's table, Guy himself was sitting in his chair with his hands on the table in front of him, looking sullenly at Dick.
In the dim, yellow light of three dusty lamps burning under the ceiling, the faces of the police seemed jaundiced.
Mirol and Frou were sitting on the windowsill, Frou was smoking. Abrom, sitting at his desk, was writing something in his papers and the appearance of Dick, apparently, was not interesting to him.
Sergeants Lau and Pei stood in the hallway and watched Dick appear in silence.
	 - Where is Glos?- Dick asked.
	 - He’s pumping up the wheel,- Guy told him.
	 - He pumps up the wheel. Well done Glos, - Dick ran his hand over his face. - Frou, what's with the abandoned house?
Even in the morning, an elderly woman who lived not far from the site, in the eighth block, came to the station and said that she had seen two "disgusting types", they were dragging something to an abandoned house on Ashley Boulevard. 
She wrote a statement and left with a sense of accomplishment. But this lady seemed to Rick's not healthy, and he did not believe in "suspicious types" from the very beginning. At least he didn't believe that these "suspicious types" were the ones they were looking for. But the statement she wrote is an official paper, and because of this paper, that house should have been checked. The residents of the house were evicted long ago, and this house has been waiting for its turn for demolition for five years.
	 - Nothing,- Frou answered him.- Wasted time. The house is empty. We found two vagrants there and took them to the office. Not only do they not have a car, they don’t have any second pants either.
	 - Okay. Old hag. - Dick put his black hat on his head and reached into the pocket of his black and gray striped jacket, for cigarettes. - Well, who thinks what? Does anyone have any ideas on this matter? You can not hesitate - I will gladly listen to everyone, - he lit a cigarette from the matches, and threw the burnt match on the floor. - And then I will please you too. Well? Where is our Duk?
	 - He's in his kennel.
	 - Well done, Duk. - Dick wrapped himself in tobacco smoke, stood with his legs wide apart, his baggy, black trousers, slightly slid down from his protruding belly.
	 - They’re on tour,- said Rick.- And if you want my opinion, then this is rubbish. They work boldly and smartly, most likely you should expect them to change their tactics. If these guys do not burn out due to stupidity or accident, then we will look for them for a long time. If we find them at all.
	 - Just don’t blurt out this to reporters. Any other considerations?
	 - Yes, they tease Mei. Bastards. What is there to think about? - said Guy. He sat motionless, and during the entire conversation, he did not move. - This is clear from the notes.
	 - Okay. Why would they want to kill a police officer? Do they want to tease us? This is a stupid business.
	 - Dick, the cop might have been killed for the hype. Apparently they are not quite on friendly terms with their head,- Frou said.- This is a show of strength. Before Mei.
	 - It's getting warmer, - Dick nodded in the direction of Frou. - Are there any more suggestions?
All were silent.
	 - Everything? No one else wants to speak up?
	 - Captain,- Sergeant Tresm Pei, who had been silent before, spoke calmly.- I don’t know why they kill, but I think they want to create a mitigating circumstance for themselves. In case of being caught.
	 - Yah?
	 - What they did to that unfortunate ... We don't hang madmen. I think this is the reason. I don't know when we will catch them, but …
	 - Tres, don't mumble!
	 - We mustn't take them, Captain. I'll tell you what. They must be shot during the arrest. This is my opinion.
Dick gazed at the sergeant for a while, his face stiffened, his unshaven cheeks drooping:
I didn't hear that from you, Tres,- he said.- Do you understand me? Now boys, listen to me very carefully. I have a surprise for you.
"Boys".
Rick watched Dick School theatrically light up his cigarette.
	 - Major Fomo Schok just called me. There's a job for you tomorrow.
	 - Interesting,- Guy muttered.
	 - The department believes that all murders are an internal struggle in the Mei empire. Old man May is no longer the same flint, although they are still afraid of him, and apparently one of his own people decided to move him. We have been instructed to close the den on Yasny Prospekt tomorrow. Other sites will also go to their targets. We must set the bandits against each other. They themselves will bring us the head of this Doddy and her accomplices!
Rick leaned his elbows on the railing of the "corral" and said:
	 - Do they have proof?
	 - Rick, there are not stupid people sitting there. And if such a task is set, then it is not without reason.
	 - That is, there is no evidence of this.
	 - This is the authoritative opinion of the leadership, and today I received an order from Major Fomo to start the operation! Is not that enough for you?
Rick remembered the girl-lieutenant from the secretariat of the department, how fervently she laughed, holding the telephone receiver, her lips thickly painted with bright lipstick and bright big eyes, looking merrily at the ceiling. He shook his head and said:
	 - Major Fomo. Dick, they just decided to play toy soldiers.
	 - He’s a major, because he’s ... a major!- Dick's face turned purple, the veins on his mighty, short neck bulged.
	 - And you, captain, because the captain. - Rick could not help laughing. - Dick, this is someone's stupid idea. There will be corpses. We will gain nothing from this.
	 - You weren’t asked, Rick! They forgot to ask you!
	 - Okay, don't get hot. It is necessary, then it is necessary. Sorry, Dick.
For a minute Dick School looked at Rick in silence, the cigarette clamped in his teeth went out. Then he spoke:
	 - Tomorrow morning the necessary papers will be delivered. We'll slam the brothel. Departure is scheduled for ten in the morning. And here's another thing. Everything must be done as tough as possible. No ceremony, the tougher the better. And you don't have to bulge your eyes like that, Rick! That's an order.


                                                 *******                               *******

Hanging his blue shirt, with a torn collar, on the open door to the closet, naked to the waist, with braces dangling at his knees, Rick stood over a large, like an elongated tin trough, wash basin. He stared at his reflection in a dim mirror attached to a yellow-tiled wall. An electric lamp hanging from the ceiling, weak and dusty, gave everything around him a ghostly and repulsive character. It smelled like urine and bleach.
Guy splashed and snorted, splashing from him flew in all directions.
Rick looked at his partner - soap suds lay flakes on Guy's round and hairy shoulders.
	 - I would love to take our Dick with me today,- Guy said, spitting from the water. - Let him steamed with us all in that gas chamber, with whores and their pimps.
	 - It was a disgusting day. - Rick opened the free bronze tap and, taking in his palms, cool, refreshing water, began to wash his face, neck, shoulders and chest. - And most importantly, all this is useless.
Guy had already straightened, stood with his solid belly thrust out forward, and was picking his right ear with his index finger. His expression took on a thoughtful tone.
	 - I think I’ll go deaf,- he said.- The screeching of these whores is still in my ears.
	 - We still have to draw up protocols.
	 - Let them tinker with the pimps in the office. They have a lot of time, maybe they will give birth to another idea.
Rick didn't want to talk about work.
In the morning, the captain from the secretariat of the police department arrived, and the day spun like a mad dog. The captain who arrived from the secretariat, short and overweight, with a yellow face and not healthy, brought documents authorizing the search and detention in the “Sauna of Good Hume”.
In three cars, all the police officers from their station, with a howl of sirens, scaring off car owners and pedestrians, rushed to the very sauna that the whole city knew about as an expensive brothel. They broke in there no worse than bandits - they broke closed doors, twisted drunk visitors and especially zealous pimp guys. Girls of easy virtue, barely covering their nakedness with anything necessary, raised an eerie and piercing screech, as if the police wanted to deprive them of their long-lost innocence. Sergeants Lowe and Pei, left on duty outside the institution, near the back door, noticed two security guards getting out of the utility room window in time - a scuffle ensued. They twisted one, but the second managed to escape.
The detained prostitutes and the guys who guarded this institution, together with the visitors, were taken to a room without windows. Steam from four saunas through the wide open doors quickly filled the already hot and stuffy atmosphere of the hall with dampness. Rick was drenched in sweat, shouted and cursed at the manager, threatened him with jail time and, shaking the papers from the city police department in front of his humped nose, forced him to open the steel safe.
Three thick ledgers from the safe, a decent amount of money in bundles tied with thick rubber bands, Rick sent in a car with Frou Ool to the office.
And also, one of the prostitutes, whom Abrom was dragging along the corridor past Rick, spat in Rik's face, and he wanted to slap her in the face, but missed and hit Abrom's ear with his palm.
	 - Vile day,- Rick said.
The door to the men's room opened and Shock Lau and Tresm Pei entered.
	 - What's in there?- Guy asked them.
	 - In the cages. That's it, - Tresm wiggled his boot-like nose in disgust. - There the captain came to the captain from the third section. They swear.
	 - It's good, - Guy nudged Rick with his elbow under the right ribs. - Rick stop rinsing. Another hour and home. Let's go and hear what they have there.
	 - Why listen there?- Grism squeezed between the officers to the “trough”, began to unbutton his shirt.- They were sent today to Twelfth Street, where May has a bookmaker's office. It seems that some of our guys were wounded.
	 - What does he want from Dick?- Rick asked him.
	 - I do not know.
Rick looked at Guy.
They left the toilet and into the corridor - to the left, a little further from them, was the black lattice of the first detention cell, and next to it, with a completely lost look, stood Duk Shopeler. He stood without a tie, in his immaculately clean, white shirt and gray, fashionable trousers. His gray, trouser-colored boots, sparkled with well-groomed leather. Pushing her hands through the bars, one of the girls said to Duk:
	 - Darling, you can't even imagine what Gamia is capable of for the sake of a man like you!- The girl's voice was bewitching and languid.
A couple of male voices in the next cell whinnied loudly.
	 - Shut your mouths!- Guy snapped.
He had already put on his shirt and buttoned up the remaining buttons that had survived today's raid.
	 - It's a vile day.- Rick tidied himself up, a pungent smell of bleach stuck in his nose.
The collar of his shirt was torn, sticking out defiantly.
After passing along the corridor and turning left, Rick and Guy went out into the "corral".
Having bypassed the dividing barrier, Rick sat down at his desk, Guy went up to the table of Mirol, who was writing something and, bending over him, asked:
	 - What is there?
	 - I’m finishing the protocol,- he replied, without raising his head, and lowering his fountain's pen into the inkwell.-  This is the third protocol.
	 - Dick, what?
From behind the closed door leading to the captain's office, muffled voices were heard.
	 - They just shouted, now they have calmed down, - Abrom Chloe was sitting on the windowsill and smoking, his cigarette was smoking in his face, which made him wrinkle his nose and, closing his right eye, looked at Rick with his left. The rays of the sun shone brightly on his blond hair and protruding ears, translucent in the rays of the sun. - Dick will tell you later.
Duk Shopeler entered the "corral" from the corridor. He stood between the tables of Rick and Mirol, glanced at Guy Ool and, shrugging his shoulders, said:
	 - Whores.
Guy laughed loudly, his stomach twitching powerfully under his wet shirt.
	 - Still, it's more pleasant to deal with corpses, - Duk breathed out. - They don't tell you obscenities …
The door to Dick's office opened, the first to come out was a gray-haired, older than Rick, medium height and well-built, the captain of the third police station, Sheld Durmey, followed by Dick School.
	 - These blockheads think we’re pawns, we can be used up!- Sheld Durmey spoke in a low, hoarse voice, he was not wearing a police uniform, but in a crumpled, black suit.- Hi, guys.
He greeted Rick first, then Guy. He walked past Duk, nodding his head to him.
	 - Rick,- Dick said.-I gave Sheld our car for two days while his car is being repaired.
	 - Which one?
	 - With a walkie-talkie.
	 - We got beat up today,- Sheld said. He stood in front of Rick, his short hands thrust into his trouser pockets, his small, gray eyes glistening.- Earl was shot in the chest. We took him to the hospital, but the doctors do not promise anything.
	 - Major Fomo ... - began to speak Dick School, but Captain Sheld interrupted him.
	 - Major Fomo, real shit, Dick. These assholes milk these scum first, then decide it's time to put our heads under the bullets!
	 - Sheld …
	 - They're milking criminals, Dick! These scum milk the same scum! And then they leave us to die. And I don't care how it sounds - it's time to call a spade a spade. And then there are no jerks. They shot Earl today, and tomorrow they will shoot you, just because someone in the office had a brilliant idea.
Dick School said nothing.
	 - Which car to take?- Sheld asked Rick.
	 - Let's go to.
He and the captain left the station, went down the steps of the porch and Rick led him to his police car.
	 - What happened to your car, Sheld?
	 - The radiator was shot, bitches. In two days the car will be returned from repair.
	 - Bookmakers?
	 - They had cover there. Atelier for tailoring, - Sheld and Rick stopped at the car and the captain, leaning against the blue hood of the car, and for some reason touched the barrel of the siren, said. - We took them all. With a cash register. May will be delighted. This is his office.
	 - Which hospital was Earl taken to?
	 - To the Second City Hospital. They said he was unlikely to survive. He has two daughters and a grumpy wife. Damn our commander fathers. Throwing five people into this hotbed of shit is nonsense! It's good that my sergeant took a couple of submachine guns. Carbines wouldn't have saved us.
Sheld Durmey got in the car and drove away.
Rick lit a cigarette, stood looking along the street, where cars stopped at the crossroads, and pedestrians hurriedly crossed the road. The setting sun was shining brightly on the windows of a nearby five-story red-brick house, where a colorful sign “Everything for Home” hung above the large showcases located on the first floor of the store.
He thought about the words of Sheld, with whom he had known for probably a thousand years, from those ancient times, when Rick had just come to work in the police and got to the Sheld's site.
Then still a sub-lieutenant Sheld Darmy.
Rick smoked and thought about the bookmakers that work quietly in a city full of policemen.
He thought about Graves, whom he knew little, but that did not change anything.
He thought about Major Fomo, about "brilliant ideas" and about the bullets piercing the chest.
And also, Rick thought about the notebook buried in the forest, and what would happen to it if he was killed?
Strange and, if properly understood, a stupid thought. What will he care about the notebook after death?
Guy came up to him.
	 - Shall we take Abrom's car?
	 - Yes,- Rick replied.
	 - Bad story.
	 - Bad.
	 - This office. After all, they not only place bets on the winnings, they buy the guys, they buy their victory.
	 - They are buying.
	 - One friend told me that he once went to boxing. Shaggy Rhys and Fat Pook fought. So, he said that he saw Shaggy lay down in the second round, although the blow was so-so, casual. And he went to bed. Specially.
	 - Shaggy - shit. Therefore, Guy, I do not like sports. I love movies, everything is fair.- Rick laughed.
	 - Well, well, of course, everything is fair in cinema.
	 - Guy, when was the last time you were in the cinema? Sometimes they show great films.
	 - Excellent films are shown there at night, for adults, and at this time I am already asleep.


                                                *******                                *******


                                                                    Chapter three.


                                                                    Abrom Chloe.



Rick got out of the stalled car and forcefully closed the driver's door.
It was morning, and from the cloudy sky, covered with heavy, dark clouds, a fine, disgusting rain was drizzling. A weak wind carried the dampness, drops of rain gathered on the peak of Rick's cap and, flowing down, dripped on his nose and cheeks. The canvas raincoat he had thrown over himself while in the car was small and tight on Rick's shoulders.
Guy stood next to him.
Department officers, five tall and strong, as if on the selection, in black, shiny raincoats, surrounded the scene of the crime. Their two large, black cars stood quietly, just above the two police cars that had driven down to the river into the lowlands. A few paces from the corpse lying under the poplar, a flock of six officers from the city administration were standing, two of their experts, who had apparently already finished their examination of the crime scene, were collecting cameras and instruments in black bags. A black, old hearse had just pulled up and pulled up on the road, waiting for its turn.
The descent to the river was not very gentle, there were sparse, gnarled trees and thin shrubs on the right, and only one mighty poplar, with spreading leaves drowning in greenery, rose almost on the very bank of the river, like a lighthouse on the sea coast.
The fog over the river slowly dissipated, its milky haze melting and drifting downstream.
Duk approached them, in his left hand he carried his valise, in his right he held a leather case with a camera by the belt.
	 - Don't stand upwind toward them,- Rick said.- You smell like fumes.
	 - Yesterday Kines came in, we drank a little with him.
	 - You drank a little.
Duk Shopeler approached Rick and Guy, paused and said:
	 - They already finished. We started about three hours ago. The department officers arrived half an hour ago.
	 - What is it, Duk?
	 - Everything is bad there.- Duk looked into Guy's face and, turning away, moved to the police car, saying,- Go see.
	 - Come on, Rick.
They began to descend down the slope, through the thick, wet grass. In the crowd of officers from the city police department, Rick saw the deputy chief of police, Major Fomo Schok, and a little to the side, disheveled, with his hands in the pockets of his raincoat, Dick School.
Having saluted the city officers, they stopped two paces from the dead body sprawled on the grass. The corpse's police shirt was open, the two top buttons were torn from the fabric along "with the meat", the trouser belt was unbuttoned, and the trousers were lowered almost to the knees. Blue, man's underwear  soaked in blood.
	 - Abrom, - muttered Guy, who was standing next to him. - Abrom, damn it.
The man they knew yesterday as Abrom Chloe was now dead. Pink intestines protruded from the open abdomen, which smiled ugly with its terrible slit, from top to groin. The face was covered with wide cuts, and there were no eyes. Instead of them, once bright and funny, two dark holes with ragged edges looked at Rick. Her wet, bloody hair clung to her forehead.
The hands of the corpse were missing, they lay at the feet of the dead man - two ugly, pale stumps, with spread, stiff fingers, under whose gray nails, blackened dirt.
	 - Damn them, Abrom.- Rick heard Guy inhale hoarsely.- Abrom.
Dick came up to them.
	 - We're going to the station.
And they left.


                                            *******                                   *******


	 - So what do we have? - sitting at his desk, Dick Shkola twirled a cigarette in his short fingers of his right hand, in his left hand he clutched a box of matches. - At midnight Abrom went out to smoke and did not return. At about half past midnight, Tresm followed him out onto the porch.
	 - Exactly at half past twelve, I looked at my watch, - said Tresm Pei, who was standing at the window. He kept his hands on his chest, looked at the captain from under his brows.
They said the same words for the third time, in different ways, without coming to any conclusions.
Guy and Shock Lau were sitting on chairs near the table, Mirol Dar was next to Tresm, Frou Ool and Rick stood on either side of the front door.
Duk Schopeler was not here.
	 - No blood, no screams, nothing,- Dick summed up.
	 - He could have been lured to the side, say, to a car that had pulled up, by some pretty girl,- Frou said.- As an option. They could come up with a reason for him to move away from the porch, and then stun him with something and take him away. The car was required.
	 - We need a witness,- said Shock Lau.- We’re not going to get anywhere. You should at least find out the make of their car.
	 - There could be witnesses. The time was not so late, some do not go to bed until morning, - said Mirol. - We must go through the apartments of the house opposite our site. At night, our lantern shines well, if someone looked out the window at that moment, he could not help but see.
	 - Here you, Tresm and Shock - do it, - Dick ordered, he hasn't lit a cigarette yet. - Go around all the apartments. What else?
	 - We need the results of the examination, - Rick looked at the captain. - We have nothing.
	 - She gave us a lot, this examination, when the sergeant was stabbed to death? - Dick struck matches, trying to light his cigarettes, the matches were damp.
Guy handed him his lighter.
	 - I don’t know how we’ll find them, but they must not walk.- Dick lit a cigarette and exhaled a thick stream of tobacco smoke.- Abrom was ours, his own. There is no need to explain anything to anyone. These scoundrels must be caught.
	 - Dick,- said Rick.- I'll tell you what. Listen to me. We're not doing what we need to do. I'm sure they are not local, they are guest performers. We need leads and witnesses.
Dick School silently looked at Riku's face, his black, washed tie, slid to the left.
	 - He just went outside to smoke,- Tresm’s voice was quiet, he tilted his head down and looked at the captain’s table without expression.- We always go out like that at night on duty. At night, the precinct is really lousy. If I knew ...- He shook his head and fell silent.
	 - These bastards work cleanly, Dick. - Guy took out his cigarettes, lit a cigarette. - And we don't even have time - we shake brothels! Any of us can be butchered like a pig, that's what it came to.
Through the dusty glass of the window frame, Rick saw a police car pulling up to their parking lot.
	 - We have guests,- he said.
A minute later, the door to Dick's office opened and Major Fomo Schok entered it - his clean-shaven face seemed calm, his black eyes looked indifferent, the police uniform - clean and ironed, looked like new on him. Together with the major, the tart smell of his cologne entered the office. Major Schock was ten years younger than Rick. He waited for Frou to close the door behind him, then quickly, examining all those present, said:
	 - Let everyone come out. Lieutenant, you stay.
Rick stayed.
He closed the door behind Tresm and looked at the Major. He stood with his legs wide apart, taking off his cap and holding it in his hands.
	 - Things are taking a nasty turn, gentlemen. - Schok stared at Dick. - Already today the newsmen will spread the news of this murder throughout the city. There will be noise. Voters don't really like it when such high-profile murders take place under their noses. And the police still don't have a single suspect. And the police are paid by the taxpayers, and the results of their work are expected to be quick and clear.
	 - Major, we have nothing yet, but we are looking and ...
Schock silenced the captain with a gesture of his hand:
	 - It's simple, School. Everything is much simpler. We cannot afford to disturb the order in the city. Unrest and protests may begin. Who needs it? The police have already gone through redundancies, so they can go over and over again. The mayor is dissatisfied, the chief of police is dissatisfied, and now the department officers have sat on our necks. Let's be honest - if there is a suspect, then there is a result!
	 - We have no one.
	 - Will be. And very soon, - the major looked at Rick, who was standing next to him, as if expecting that he would take the suspect out of his pocket and put it on the table in front of him. - You will find him, and no later than in three days!
	 - It...
	 - School, you did not understand me, - the major smiled at Dick with a fatherly smile. - We need to dump steam from the boiler. We need to show them the result. You need a "parrot" - any, but not a vagrant. Nobody will believe in a vagabond who cuts the cops. Someone more decent. He will sit for a week or two, and then we will let him go for lack of evidence. I hope that by then the real killers will be caught.
Dick leaned back in his chair and, staring at the Major, asked:
	 - Why us?
	 - Because the victim worked at your site. What's the difference? Just do what you're told and everyone will be happy. I will give the details later.
Rick gazed steadily at the major, at his shiny right cheek turned towards him, at his bulging black eye and well-groomed black hair on his head.
And then Rick spoke two words:
	 - This is a forgery.
Schok turned his head in his direction, smiled:
	 - What?- He asked.- What are you talking about, Lieutenant?
	 - Me, about an official crime called forgery. And we are on "you"?
	 - I knew you were a splinter fellow, Lieutenant, but I didn't think you were such a fool. You have to do what the big people tell you.
Dick was already fidgeting in his chair, he was already starting to get out of it.
	 - Rick!
But once he started talking, Rick couldn't bring himself to shut up.
	 - Big people are those who vote for those who promised them honesty and order. And you are just a cap that must obey the law!
	 - Rick! Damn it!
	 - You were still whimpering under the folder strap when the first bullets flew at me. When these quarters were being built, gangs were operating here, and half of our guys were killed! Take off your uniform, you don't deserve it.- Rick felt his face fill with heat. - What is written on your badge? «Safeguard and Protect»! What are you offering me here? Hang an innocent, slander, break and kill him?
	 - Rick! - Dick has already got out from behind his table, he pushed his way between the major and Rick, pushing Rick to the door. - We'll talk to you later!
	 - You are a cap. Remember this! - continued to say Rick. - And people like you …
	 - Rick, shut up!- Dick yelled so hard that Rick’s ears filled.
He paused in surprise, looking into the red, crimson face of the captain.
	 - Yes, we'll talk later, - said Schok, putting a cap on his dark head. - I won't forget.


                                              *******                                *******


Five days have passed.
Abrom Chloe's funeral took place on Thursday. At the cemetery, outside the city, many police officers arrived, Major Schok made a grandiloquent speech, at the end of which, looking at the widow Chloe, he promised that the “bloody killers” would soon be caught. He spoke of "ruthless justice" and "the inviolability of the law."
"Bloody killers".
"Courts of Justice".
Abrom was buried in a closed coffin.
Rick went up to Sume and Chemsu, who was standing at the grave, hugged her, and uttered some vague words of consolation that he could not remember later, as if he apologized to her for the death of her Abrom. Chems stood next to his mother, holding her right hand, his face froze like a mask, and a dumb question burned in his bright eyes — "why?" Laina took time off from work and was next to Sueme. Dick's and Frou's wives stood next to the widow.
Some officials from the city police department approached the widow with her son.
The funeral was over.
The investigation into the murder of Abrom Chloe has not advanced, not one step.
Rick had just finished his last of two ham sandwiches, washed down with hot, sweet tea from an iron mug. The sun was shining brightly in the only window of his office, the police cap lying on the windowsill glittered with a yellow cockade, and the smell of cigarette butts was creeping out of the glass ashtray next to a pile of cardboard folders.
Rick took off his black tie, tossed it on the table to his left, and lit a cigarette.
At that moment, the door to the office opened and Kines Grain entered - in an impeccable beige shirt, light gray trousers and cream-colored, fashionable shoes. He was all, somehow luxurious and dazzling, an expensive watch glittered on the wrist of Kines's left hand, and the air around Rick was filled with the smell of good cologne.
	 - You could have knocked. - Rick got up, greeting Kines, nodded in the direction of the chair. - Sit down.
	 - How are you?
Kines drew a chair close to him, and before sitting on it, he meticulously examined the surface of the seat.
He sat down.
	 - Shit.- Rick glanced at the silver cufflinks on the sleeves of a private investigator's shirt, at the white hat pushed to the back of his head, which are sold in the brand shops of the Pacific Harbor district, and said.- I see that you are not in distress. Are you going to drink tea?
	 - No, thanks, - Kines's bright eyes looked calmly. - I actually dropped by to you on business, Rick.
Rick pushed the ashtray away from him, wrinkled his nose from the tobacco smoke.
	 - What business? I don’t work on the side.
	 - The Abrom case.
Rick gazed into Kines's eyes.
	 - Lay it out.
	 - Someone is trying to lure May's guys over to their side.
	 - What does Abrom have to do with it?
	 - I was talking to a guy from the Steam Locomotive gang this morning at Mika’s bar. He said.
	 - Did he say so? Like, someone recruits them for themselves?- Rick grinned skeptically.
	 - The thing is, he came up to me, Rick. I sat alone at the table, and did not invite anyone to my company.
	 - So he came up to you himself?
	 - Rick, we are now having a private conversation - no protocol.
	 - It is clear. I'm listening, Kai, I'm listening.
	 - He sat down at my table and laid it out straight. He said that three guys came into a bar on Fourth Street and started talking about old May's time to retire, and that he had become too stingy with his guys lately. But that's not all, Rick. One of those types allegedly directly accused May of working for "caps", saying that Shorty was giving up his guys to the police, and generally behaving like a police wiping.
	 - Boldly.
	 - Stupid.
	 - Just Shorty, is that all?
	 - Yes. Shorty.
	 - And they could just walk away?
	 - They had two «Prochi», Rick. And this is a thousand good arguments per minute! Nobody jerked. When the guys from the Steam Locomotive gang decided to touch the guests, they presented their arguments.
Rick leaned back in his chair, looked into Kines's calm face, and considered what he had heard from him. 
	 - What do they want from you? You're not a bandit, you don't work for May's.
	 - Who needs to know, they know that after the Murlay case, I often hang out in the bar with you and Guy.
	 - You and Guy will become consummate alcoholics.
	 - They want you to track these bastards. They think that by providing this service to the police, they will thereby earn your favor, and will not appear as "snitches".
	 - Hmm. The Steam locomotive gang work for May, petty robbers, pimps, prostitutes, petty racketeering. They don't get involved in murders. Kai, it turns out that you were herded.
	 - But that's not all. The recruiters arrived in a blue "Thrower-8 C", vehicle number TL 4472.
	 - The number is fake.
	 - I think yes.
	 - So the blue "Thrower-8C". This is already something. They didn't tell their signs?
	 - They described the signs of one of them. Medium height, brunette, strong build. And the main thing. He has a scar on his right arm, from the elbow to the hand.
Rick took a notebook from his shirt pocket and quickly jotted down what he had heard from Kines.
	 - So these sons of bitches want our favor. Hmm.
	 - Recently the police patted May hard on the cheeks.- Kines lit a cigarette.- I think it was May who gave the order to these guys to talk to me.
The cigarettes were expensive, "White Cliff" brands, and Rick's office began to fill with the aroma of noble tobacco.
	 - Received the inheritance?
	 - That's my job, Rick. I have no one to leave an inheritance. The last client was in need of some sort of business, and I helped him.
	 - You surprise me every time, Kai. What's the matter if it's not a secret? I just want to know how guys like you earn their living.
	 - Blackmail. I went out to the blackmailer and I was lucky. My client's compromising papers were in my hands. Family matters. The client was a little generous.
	 - Hmm. And everything is within the law?
	 - I don’t work otherwise.- Kines looked straight into Rick’s face, smiled his rustic smile, and an expression of sincerity froze in his eyes.
	 - Can I go to you as an assistant, Kai? I, too, will be able to beat muzzles, deceive widows, and climb into the windows of empty apartments for the necessary evidence.
	 - You can't do that.- Kines shook his head.- No.
	 - And why is that?
	 - Rick, you are rooted in this chair! With such an armchair you can't get out the window at night.
	 - What are you working on now?
	 - Now, Rick, I'm in temporary retirement, eating up my fee and waiting for the onset of poverty.
	 - Well, it won't threaten you soon. Guy and I want to sit at his house, talk, have a bite. Tonight. Come on over.
	 - I'll come.
They said goodbye and Kines left.
A few minutes later Rick was in Dick's office.
	 - Did Grain tell you this?- Dick looked into Rick’s eyes in disbelief, it was clear that the School was deciding whether to believe what he heard or not.- I saw him at our site.
	 - Now we have a clue, Dick. We must give signs to the patrols. I think we'll catch these bastards.
	 - There are, nevertheless, and among the private traders there are decent guys.
Dick School reached for the telephone.


                                               *******                                *******


                                                                  Chapter four.


                                                                    Abduction.


They drove along East Avenue, past the School of Fine Arts. The time was approaching evening, and the slanting shadows from tall maples growing in the park, to the right of the road, shaded the roadway with pleasant coolness.
The hot day was retiring.
Rick has seen active men on the streets twice today, whose hats were adorned with white ribbons. They approached the passers-by and, holding out sheets of paper to the passers-by, spoke to them fervently about something.
Activists.
They collected signatures for the removal from their posts of the chief of police, the mayor of Quiet Harbor and the city prosecutor. If things go on like this, then new elections in the city are not far off.
For the first time in three days, Guy bought one of the cheap newspapers he read and sat in the passenger seat, peering at the printed columns.
	 - Well, of course, - he muttered. - Who would doubt it.
	 - What is there?- Rick was driving along the first lane of the road, lightly pressing his foot on the accelerator pedal, and from time to time glanced in the rearview mirror.
	 - They write that the development of progress in Firmness is being held back by someone.
	 - By someone …
	 - Rick, you don't listen at all!
	 - Guy, I'm not deaf. Well, first of all, we could not develop faster, if only because of two big wars and general devastation. It took time to recover. And secondly ... And secondly …
The dark brown "Dogery 3", with a tarpaulin roof, continued to trail behind them, did not lag behind, but did not go to overtake. Rick spotted it three blocks ago.
	 - And secondly...
	 - So what?
Rick jerked the steering wheel to the left and the car squeaked with springs as it swerved into Seventh Street. He passed the intersection, overtook the slowly crawling, poisonous green paint, truck crane, and again looked in the rearview mirror.
The "Dogery" did not lag behind.
	 - Rick you're driving the wrong way!
	 - The tail is following us.
	 - Yah?!
	 - He's been following us for a long time. At the end of the block, we will stop to see the wheel, and take a fellow. Get ready, Guy.
Rick had already passed several four-story red-brick houses and was looking for a place to stop when the "Dogery 3" sharply increased its speed and started to overtake. Guy had just pulled out his nine-shot, long-barreled "Mahm", looked at the cartridges in the "drum" of the pistol.
Rick turned his head to the left, and managed to notice in a car passing by, a sharp-nosed profile of a passenger, with a black hat pulled down over his eyes.
The "Dogery" moved quickly forward in the second lane.
	 - Everything. He left. - Rick spat in the open, side window. - Don't strain.
	 - Damn him. Can we catch up with him?
	 - So what?
	 - So what? Let's check it out!
	 - He was with us on his way.
Rick drove around the block, turned onto Light Avenue, and a few minutes later drove up to Guy's brick house, stopped the car, driving her right wheels onto the low curb of a wide flower bed with daisies.
Near the rusty, children's carousel, children were playing, on the ropes stretched between the poplars, snow-white sheets were drying.
Guy opened the door on his side of the cabin and asked:
	 - When to wait for you?
	 - In two hours, not earlier. Now I'll park the car near the site, go home, then go to the store …
	 - I see. Laina trained you, you can't just sit and have a drink. We sell good cutlets. There are good cutlets in the shop around the corner.
	 - I have heartburn from cutlets.
	 - You will spend an hour on the road!
	 - Kai will pick me up.
	 - Okay. Looking forward to both of you, but don't be late, Rick. I have to go to work tomorrow.
	 - I'm taking you to the "Under the Oak" tavern.
Getting out of the car, Guy Ool either groaned or laughed.
The boys who were playing in the courtyard of the house had abandoned all their important affairs on the low carousel, and now they were staring at the police car with all their eyes.
Rick showed them his tongue, which caused indescribable delight among the children.


                                            *******                                     *******

Leaving the car on the site near the police station and saying goodbye to those on duty at night, Fru and Shock, Rick rode the bus to the house, entered the apartment and folded the "drunken wardrobe" in a paper bag and, tearing a piece of paper from his notebook, he wrote Laina a note - “I'm at Guy's. I'll be back tomorrow night. "
He put the note on the nightstand in front of the mirror so that Laina could see it right away.
He stopped in front of the mirror, looking at his reflection, straightened the collar of his blue shirt with a police badge, and left.
"Drunken wardrobe", Rick carried the package in his left hand, inwardly ashamed of himself.
The “drunken wardrobe” consists of felt slippers, an old yellow T-shirt and the same old black leotards with stretched bubbles on the knees.
A merciless booze was coming, and in front of it it was worth changing into something long-suffering and inexpensive, if you did not want your police uniform to look like a tramp's rags in the morning.
The sun had already set over the horizon, the street lights were about to turn on and, in the coming twilight, it seemed that everything in Firmness's was calm and easy. Cars drove along the street, shining with piercing headlights, slow music sounded somewhere nearby.
When he reached the corner of the department store, which had closed and quieted down, Rick stopped at a dimly lit shop window, looked around for Kines's car, and took out a pack of cigarettes.
Kai hasn't arrived yet.
And it is not known when he will arrive.
Lighting a cigarette, Rick thought with irritation that perhaps Kai was delayed, which means the feast would be postponed to a later time.
Behind Rick, the brakes creaked and the sound of a door opened.
Putting out his gas lighter and looking back, Rick smiled, expecting to see Kai, but someone else appeared in front of him.
Major Avs Hul.
His driver quickly approached them.
Poking Rick with something hard in the stomach and taking him by the left elbow, Major Avs quietly ordered:
	 - Get in the car. No nonsense.
The driver put Rick's hands behind his back and handcuffed them. Rick had time to see the gun pressed to his stomach when he was pushed into the back of the car.
Everything happened quickly.
Rick didn't resist.
The car jerked forward and quickly, picking up speed, rushed down the street. Rick was sitting on a leather sofa, looking out the window.
	 - They want to talk to you, lieutenant. - Avs did not turn his head, spoke calmly and even friendly. - You cannot lead serious people by the nose.
"They want to talk."
Rick remembered the ripped belly of Abrom's corpse, its gaping sockets.
	 - You could have arrested me at the station or at home. By all rules, ”he said, looking at the back of the Major’s head.
	 - Why are these formalities, Lieutenant? My department doesn't like to make noise. And this is not an arrest. You will be interviewed and you will return to your duties. Unless you lie to us again.
“You will return to your duties.
The car raced towards the north of the city, past the workers' quarters, its powerful engine roaring.
	 - I have nothing to add to what I have already told you.
Rick spoke the words in a calm voice, as if the conversation was taking place on the street, and not in a car, which was now racing in an unknown direction, and his hands were not fastened with handcuffs.
"- I should have shot." - he thought, but this thought seemed ridiculous to him. Looking at the major sitting motionless in his chair, Rick realized that in case of resistance, everything would end for him, a bullet in the stomach.
	 - I don’t understand what you want from me.
	 - Where is old woman Vak notebook?
	 - What are you talking about, Major?
He didn’t answer.
Dick’s words, spoken by him on the day of the murder of Abrom, persistently appeared in Rick’s head:
"- At midnight Abrom went out to smoke and did not return ..."
And in unison with Dick's words, Frou Ool's words sounded:
"- He could have been lured to the side, say, to a car that had pulled up, by some pretty girl ..."
Rick felt the fear of the cold of hopelessness touch his belly.
It was like panic.
Trying to return his thoughts to a sober and calm mood, Rick quickly convinced himself that the major had nothing to do with the murders of policemen in the city. However, Avs or those to whom he is now taking Rick, nothing will prevent, if necessary, to expose Rick's death as another victim of a crazy maniac.
Rick knew that the keys to the handcuffs were in his right trouser pocket, and that he would not be able to get them out of there, even if he tried hard. Looking at the back of the Major in the front seat, Rick imagined hitting him in the back of the head with his forehead.
What's next?
Nothing!
The street lights were just lit when the car swept past the industrial part of the city - the gloomy brick boxes of the Doge and Company workshops flashed outside the window to the right. To the left stretched the fence of the transport terminal, behind a high, dark fence, black rows of containers towered like ugly skeletons of giants, cranes froze in their places, sleeping until morning. The street lights ran out, and the road continued in a gloomy, ghostly ribbon.
The darkness in the car's interior, as thick as a thundercloud, was illuminated only by the illumination of the instruments on the driver's dashboard.
The moon was shining in the sky.
They passed the industrial zone of the city and now rushed past the darkened railway depot, and further, around the bend, will begin as straight as an arrow, highway number 7.
Avs struck a lighter, the darkness in the cabin lit up with its yellow light, tobacco smoke enveloped it in fog.
	 - The tail seems to be behind us,” the driver said dryly.
Avs looked back, looked out the back window of the car, said:
	 - Night reveler. Let him bypass us.
At the very corner, the driver slowed down greatly.
Rick turned his head to the right, and saw the lights of a car chasing them, its black silhouette against the background of a ghostly moonlit field. Having increased the speed, the car quickly caught up with them, for a second or two both cars were driving opposite each other, and then one after another three pops were heard, three flashes flashed outside, with a dull ringing, the driver's glass crumbled, and the driver fell towards Major Avs.
Rick managed to rest his knees on the back of the front seat when the car swerved sharply to the right, dived into a ditch with its nose and, jumping a couple of times on potholes, turned over. He was twisted, he could not distinguish where the top was and where the bottom was. Rick was thrown to the side and he hit his head hard on the metal of the door - a white light flashed before his eyes. Falling on the wheels, the car froze in place, its engine stalled. Rick slid down from the couch, and was looking now at the motionless body of the driver, at his unnaturally twisted to the left, head.
Avs groaned, loudly and harshly, his left leg was lifted high up, and awkwardly protruded above the steering wheel. Rick began to get out on the sofa, when shots rang out from somewhere to the right - bang, bang, bang, bang …
And everything was quiet.
Someone's black shadow approached the window, and the door behind which Rick was grunting was opened.
	 - Are you alive?- Kines's voice asked him.
Rick didn't answer.
He fell out of the car face up, the handcuffs cut into his wrists to unbearable pain.
Kines helped Rick to his feet.
The air smelled strongly of gasoline.
	 - You, just in time, Kai. I have the keys to the handcuffs in my right trouser pocket.
A minute later, Rick was already kneading his hands, burning with pain, standing with his shoulder resting on the cold side of the car.
The moon looked indifferently at the night Firmness.
Kines's car stood a stone's throw from the bow of Avs's car, its headlights illuminating the sparse bushes behind the slope.
Kines himself, having opened the front passenger door, was already examining the dead Major Avs, a lighted gas lighter in the private investigator's hand dimly shone.
Rick was silent.
He lit a cigarette and, looking at Kines's bent back, thought what he would tell him in a minute.
Kines straightened up, stood by the car and looked at something, holding it in his hands.
	 - Wow.
And that's all.
Just "wow".
Rick approached him, looked at the dark silhouettes of bodies in the car.
	 - They have too high a status for cop-killing maniacs, Rick.
	 - Yes. High status.
Kines held several dark books in his hands, opening one of them, commented to Riku:
	 - Major Avs Hul. Federal Department of Inquiry. - Kines handed Rick the documents of the already dead Avs. - And this is interesting. Gitch Past, from the military office, with the rank of captain. His face. ABOUT! Faum Yansha, County Telephone Control Officer. He had various hobbies. And this is ... Hmm. Citizen of many faces. '' Kines stubbed out his lighter.
Rick was silent.
	 - What did they want from you, Rick? Were you taken to visit your aunt?
	 - Kai …
A passenger car stopped on the road, its headlights on with their bright light illuminated the crash site.
	 - Kai, I will speak.
On the embankment, a man began to descend towards them.
	 - Is everyone alive?- The man approached, it was a plump man in a dark suit, middle-aged, without a hat, a short mustache darkened on his round face.
	 - Almost everything.- Rick went up to him.- I'm a police lieutenant. There was a car accident here.
The stranger peered over his shoulder into the broken driver's window, and Rick saw blood on the shards of the car's windshield.
A lot of blood.
	 - They're dead,- the man looked shocked.
	 - Lieutenant Rickslem Yark. I would like to take a look at your documents.
	 - Yes, yes, of course, - the man reached into the inside pocket of his jacket and, taking out his identity card, handed it to Rik. - This is a bad place, a sharp turn …
	 - Mr. Rams Loik? This is your car?
	 - Of course, mine.
Rick gave him his documents, said:
	 - We need you to call the police here as soon as possible. Drive to the nearest phone, we'll stay here.
The man left.
Kines stood aside, like a dark monument, near his car, smoking.
	 - Rick, you have nothing to tell me?
	 - Kai, perhaps I do not even doubt that you have saved my life now. - Rick tried to choose his words, spoke slowly. - I will not lie to you, so I will limit myself to the most necessary. Soon the police will be here, the case is filthy, in all respects, filthy. Don't ask about anything. Let's define our theory of what happened.


                                                  *******                              *******


The next morning, Rick was summoned to the city police department, where he told the colonel and two police majors about what had happened to him that night. Rick met Kines Grain there, he was invited when Rick was writing an explanatory note.
When, an hour later, they left the building of the city police and, stopping near Rick's police car, lit a cigarette, Kines said:
	 - I was told not to leave the city, so that if they need me, they can contact me.
	 - The case has just begun. I think that everything will die out, and very soon.
	 - My license and weapons were taken away from me, before the end of the proceedings.
	 - Kai, take my word for it - this case burns their heels.
	 - A lot of mud, Rick. It's not a good thing.
	 - Not good. Stick with our version, Kai, and everything will be fine.
	 - "Everything will be fine."- Kines casually looked around, then shifting his gaze to Rick's face, said calmly. - Rick, I do not meddle in your affairs, but here I would like to hear some details of what happened, since I have two corpses on me, and these corpses were not very common people.
Rick had already decided everything.
He said:
	 - Kai, I never lie to my friends. We meet at Guy's tonight. I'll tell you everything there. This is neither the time nor the place for that.
That was the end of the conversation.
They parted in silence, each getting into his own car.
Rick did not immediately return to his station. Having traveled three blocks and, making sure that the "tail" did not follow him, he stopped the car near a small pharmacy located at the end of a six-story, brick building, and entered the pharmacy, went to the counter. It smelled like medicine. As Guy would say, "potion." An elderly pharmacist, a balding man with a plump, wrinkled face, wearing a medical gown, looked tiredly at Rick.
	 - I listen, you, officer.
	 - Good morning. I need to call.
	 - To the left, a booth behind a screen.
	 - How much do I owe you?
	 - Quarter.
Passing behind a screen covered with colored chintz, he found himself in front of a single, glazed booth with a telephone set inside. Looking back, Rick walked into the booth, closed the poorly fitted door behind him, took a handkerchief out of his shirt pocket, and, putting it to his mouth, picked up the phone.
After a short beep, a lively, female voice was heard in the receiver:
	 - Switch. Listen to you. Speak.
	 - Good day. Connect me at 749354.
	 - Wait a second.
Something clicked in the telephone receiver, and a few seconds later the ringing tone began.
	 - Editorial office of the newspaper "Quiet Harbor News". Listen to you.
	 - Perhaps it will interest you. Tonight, on the outskirts of the city, on the bypass road where the industrial zone is located, there was a car accident and a shootout.
	 - Excuse me, but who says this?
	 - Two unknown persons in a car, kidnapped Lieutenant Rickslem Yark from the second police station. Out of town …
	 - Kidnapped a police lieutenant?
	 - Exactly. The kidnapping was averted by private investigator Kines Grain, who knocked the kidnappers' car off the road and shot both kidnappers.
	 - Rickslem Yark? Yark you said? Is he alive?
	 - Yark. He's alive.
Rick hung up the hook of the telephone, then called two more local newspaper offices, and left the pharmacy.
He returned to his precinct.
Dick called him into his office, and for the second time that morning, listened to his story about the abduction.
	 - Damn it, Rick.- Dick kneaded a cigarette in the fingers of his right hand, looked worried.- There’s going to be a fuss. If everything comes out.
	 - Yes, there will be a scandal, that's for sure.
	 - Okay. Mind your own business for now. If they call from the office, I'll let you know about it.
Guy met him in the "corral", grabbed his right elbow, asked:
	 - Well? Tell me! Kai killed them all?
	 - Everyone. Outright.
	 - Well done. He's a worthwhile guy. Rick, tell me! 
	 - I'll tell you in the car.
Frou and Mirol, sitting at their tables, silently looked at him.
And three hours later, lunch was not over yet, and Rick and Guy were standing on the porch at the entrance to the station, smoking, a car from the control room came up. It was a brand new four-seater "Bajo", blue in color, with a shiny radio transmitter antenna on the roof. Major Fomo came out of the "Bajo", he quickly approached Rick and said:
	 - Get in the car, Lieutenant. The Office wants to talk to you.
Rick looked at Guy and went to the car. He opened the back door and, as he sat down on the sofa, he saw Kines sitting there.
	 - They took me out of the house,- he explained, shrugging his shoulders.
Kines was dressed in a navy blue tracksuit, a massive silver ring on his left index finger that glittered defiantly.
	 - Have you been arrested?- Rick asked him.
The driver-captain started the engine and the car started abruptly, picking up speed, passed the intersection.
	 - This is not an arrest,- said Major Fomo, sitting in the front passenger seat.- They want to talk to both of you.
	 - I wrote everything that was in the report, - Rick looked at Kines. - And then, in the morning, Colonel Zhogs …
	 - That was in the morning, Lieutenant. It's afternoon. - Fomo, hesitated a little and, without turning his head, asked. - You both, do you happen to know who launched the newsmen on us?
	 - I don’t know.- Rick looked at Kines.- Kai, did you tell anyone? …
	 - I'm?- Kines folded his hands in his lap, his eyes clear and understanding.- I have no reporters friends.
	 - Major, look for the leak at your place. There are many guys in management who have too long a tongue.
	 - You forget yourself, Lieutenant.
Fifteen minutes later, the "Bajo" drove into a sunny parking lot near the bulky, light-gray building of the city police headquarters. Rick, looking out the car window, saw a crowd of reporters at the entrance. About ten people dressed in civilian clothes were smoking while standing between the columns, cameras hanging on belts around their necks spoke eloquently about their profession.
	 - I would warn you, gentlemen, against unnecessary advertising. - Fomo got out of the car.
Rick and Kines followed him. They climbed the high steps of the marble staircase, and the three of them were immediately surrounded on all sides by reporters.
	 - Are you Lieutenant Rickslem Yark?
	 - A few words about your abduction!
	 - Do you have any clues on this case?
They crowded around Rick and Kines, pushed Major Fomo back to the entrance door.
	 - An investigation has begun,- Rick said, squeezing between the reporters to the front door.
	 - No comments on the case! - shouted Fomo. - Lieutenant, they are waiting for you!
The control building greeted them with coolness.
Climbing the stairs to the second floor, all three entered the office of the head of the city police department, Colonel Dawn Zhogs.
In a spacious office, brightly lit by three large windows overlooking Vostochny Avenue, with a high, snow-white ceiling, there were four people.
He knew two of them.
Colonel Dawn Jogs, a tall, thin and graying man in his sixties, sat in his deep armchair at the beginning of the table, under a large oil painting showing a battle between General Fume's soldiers and officers of the Second Army of the White Castes ... The painting was a copy of the original, which is now in the National Museum of High Heights.
The colonel was sitting upright, in a blue, austere uniform, and in his right hand, a thick smoking pipe was smoking.
District Attorney Erm Salt sat in a chair next to the Colonel.
If Rick had a definite opinion about Colonel Zhogs, as there were rumors about the unheard-of luxury in his house, and about the jewelry of his wife, about Erma Salt, Rick did not hear anything bad about the friend and patron of the mayor of the city. He knew that the district attorney has long been trying to remove the mayor, and even personally leads one of the criminal cases of embezzlement in the mayor's office. 
He was a short man, well built, he looked about forty years old, he had blond, short-cropped hair sticking out at the top of his head, small, deep-set eyes and a clean shaven, wide face. His white shirt, with the top buttons unbuttoned, bared his hairy chest, the watch on his left hand glittered.
Outwardly, he could pass for a small businessman or even a bandit.
The other two men, Rick had seen for the first time.
"Gemini".
He immediately thought about them – "Gemini".
They sat across from the district attorney, both dressed in brand new light gray striped suits, starched white shirt collars and tight, black ties shining underneath. Both were dark-haired, one with a narrow, pale, elongated face, the other cheeky and tanned. They kept their identical gray hats in their laps.
	 - Major, leave us,- the colonel said, looking at Rick.
Fomo went out and quietly closed the door behind him.
	 - Have a seat, - the colonel took a drag on his pipe and his face was enveloped in tobacco smoke. - Anywhere.
Rick and Kines grabbed the chairs from the wall and sat down at the table — next to each other, to the left of the DA, directly across from the twins.
	 - Allow me to introduce you, gentlemen.- The Colonel spoke calmly, drawing out a little.- Lieutenant Rickslem Yark, Kines Grain. They are Major Zis Schik and Major Schlos Fae, from the Investigation Department.
The "Gemini" didn't even nod their heads, sat silently looking at Rick and Kines.
The colonel continued:
	 - This case has, mne-uh ... It has an ambiguous character. Given the seriousness of the situation in the city, with the advent of the Little Doddy gang, the district attorney personally monitors this case. Now abduction is it. Lieutenant, I’ll tell you right away that our conversation is friendly to both of you, in nature, and we are not here to doubt you or cast a shadow on you ... Hmm. Shadow. But two kidnappers were killed, you could become another victim, and for us such a turn of the case would be extremely undesirable. Our County Inquiry Department has taken control of the investigation into the murder of police officers in our city.
	 - I understand. - Rick looked the colonel in the face. - But I can hardly add anything to my report, Mr. Colonel.
The “Gemini” remained silent.
The district attorney silently lit a cigarette. He sat in his chair, half-turned to Rick, putting his left hand on the table, slowly drumming his fingers on the sparkling varnish of the table.
	 - Let's start, - Colonel Zhogs glanced at the officers of the department of inquiry. - Please.
	 - Actually, we have already familiarized ourselves with your testimony, - said the high-cheeked major. - We just would like to talk to you. You know, how it happens, the official protocol is unnerving, and in an ordinary conversation, details that have eluded before can be recalled.
	 - I understand. - Rick was now looking at the "cheekbones", who is Shik, and who is Faye, he did not understand.
	 - What did the kidnapper say to you?- The “pale” asked, he did not look at Rick, but spoke, looking at his hands on the table.- If possible, literally.
“- It's begun,”- Rick thought.
He had already written everything in his report, but they decided to interrogate him again.
	 - He said - "into the car, no nonsense."
	 - You wrote that the kidnapper put a gun to your stomach. Have you seen him, this pistol?
	 - Yes. I saw him.
	 - Okay. With this we have no questions for you. Lieutenant, you mentioned your first meeting with the kidnappers in your report. Why do you think they didn't kidnap you then?
	 - In the afternoon? In front of witnesses? - Rick showed some irony on his face. - Many people saw them and their car, and after my disappearance, it would immediately become known to the police.
	 - Yes. That's how it is, - the "pale" looked at Rick, and he saw his attentive, gray-green eyes, with rare, short eyelashes. - And what kind of object did the kidnapper mention?
“- And here, no punctures.” - thought Rick.
He gave his face an expression of thoughtfulness, as if trying to remember more accurately the conversation just mentioned.
	 - To be precise, then …
	 - If possible,- said the "cheekbone".
	 - It was about a woman. He showed me a photograph of her and asked if I knew her. The woman's face seemed familiar to me, but I could not answer more definitely.
	 - Did he tell you anything else?
	 - He said that he was looking for some thing, which, according to him, was in her possession.
	 - He said so – "thing"?
	 - Now I can’t remember exactly how he said. But either "thing" or "object". That's for sure.
	 - What was the name of that woman, Lieutenant? Do you remember her name?
In that second, Rick realized that the "twins" knew a lot more about that story in the car than they should have known if they had nothing to do with it.
Major Avs, at their first meeting, did not call the notebook a notebook. He said "a thing," and only last night, in the car, he called this thing "Old woman Vak's notebook."
	 - He didn't say her name. He said that she had a very important thing for them, and that they were looking for it.
	 - I see. Necessary thing. Hmm. And what did you talk to him about at the time of the abduction? Did he tell you anything specific about this?
	 - No. - Rick put on a poorly concealed irritation and said. - He said that they want to talk to me.
	 - Is that all? Lieutenant, this is very important.
	 - And that's all. Major, somehow at that moment I was not in the mood for heart-to-heart conversations.
Colonel Dawn Jogs spoke conciliatoryly:
	 - Lieutenant, don't be so nervous. Nobody wants to accuse you of anything. Our colleagues from the Inquiry Department are also involved in this case.
	 - I understand.
"Tanned" asked Rick:
	 - And the driver? Did he tell you anything?
	 - Not. He was generally silent all the way, until the very appearance of Kines Grain. They were both silent.
	 - What did he say when he saw Grain's?
	 - He said that "the tail seems to be behind us." Avs ignored his warning, believing that the car catching up with us is an ordinary "night reveler".
	 - He said so, "night reveler"?
	 - Yes.
	 - Did they take the pistol from you, Lieutenant?- The district attorney, who had been silent before, asked him.
	 - Not. The pistol was with me all the time, in a holster. But when your hands are handcuffed behind your back, a gun is of little use.
	 - And you yourself, what are your thoughts on your abduction, Lieutenant?- The “tanned man” asked again.- Why exactly you? There must be some logical explanation for this?
	 - A logical explanation? - Now Rick decided that it is possible to portray a stronger annoyance, he raised his voice, looking at the "tanned" in the face. - And what logical explanation can be in the murder of a police sergeant? And in the murder of a sub-lieutenant from my precinct? How can you explain this, Major? Some bastards slaughter us like pigs for advertising, just for their great fame. They release their guts and leave notes at the crime scene - "From Doddy!" In what can you see the logic here? Psychopaths have no logic!
	 - Lieutenant! We are not gathered here to shout, - the colonel looked sternly at Rick, his pipe had long gone out and lay on the table in front of him. - Still, do not forget about the chain of command.
	 - I remember, Mr. Colonel.
	 - That's better.
	 - Lieutenant, - "tanned" smiled at Rik with the edges of his narrow lips. - Don't be so nervous. You yourself understand, we are all in one team and we carry our cart.
“We carry our cart”.
It was Major Avs's expression.
“We carry our cart”.
Rick decided it was time to go on the offensive, he spoke with an apparent effort to remain calm.
	 - Do you want it frankly, mister major?
	 - Just to be honest, Lieutenant.
	 - I saw their documents. These are real documents, at least I could not suspect them of forgery. Very natural. And for various services, including FDI. This is your department of inquiry. And his rank was Major. Major Avs Hul. And his bearing, and the way he spoke. This was not a bandit from a greater road, this man has years of service behind him! This is what I know for sure. And in his documents of the Federal Department of Inquiry, there was the seal of the department of inquiry. Your department, mister major. And this seal was real! And if not for Kai, I would not be sitting here with you now, discussing the details of what happened, but lying somewhere in a ditch with gutted intestines!
Both "twins" did not change in their faces, both were now looking at Rick.
"Tanned" calmly said:
	 - Lieutenant, you do not want to seriously say that you think that the officers of our department drive around the city and kill the police?
Rick decided to portray a "stubborn cop", leaned back in his chair and said:
	 - What should I think? I saw their documents with my own eyes.
	 - Our experts are now dealing with these, if I may say so, documents, but now it can be argued that they are fake. This is the opinion of our experts.
Rick hesitated to answer. After a pause, he stubbornly said:
	 - Your experts. Your experts know better, Major.
“Tanned” looked at the district attorney, regret in his voice.
	 - And how do you suggest that we work together, gentlemen? Now all the policemen will be aiming at us with their weapons!
	 - Let's not dramatize, - the colonel thoughtfully picked up his pipe. - The story is filthy and there are a lot of oddities in it. Policemen were killed, one attempt failed. Murders of small traders are going around the city, children were killed. We are all on the nerves. But you have to be realistic and not give in to emotions.- He turned his gaze from the pipe to Rick.- We don't need emotions, Lieutenant.
	 - I understand, Mr. Colonel.
	 - Hmm. Our guys will definitely find these scoundrels, - the colonel, apparently deciding to smoke, began to fill his pipe with tobacco. He took it with two fingers from a green, tin box, and poured it into a tube, and a large, gold ring with a green, faceted stone sparkled on the middle finger of his left hand.- A lot of people have already been thrown into this business, and mistrust between us can ruin everything. Moreover, this mistrust is stupid. Do you have any more questions, gentlemen?
	 - As a matter of fact, no, - the "tanned" answered him. - If we dig up something, we will inform you, Mr. Colonel.
Rick noted that the majors had no questions for Kines, who was sitting next to him.
“As a matter of fact”.


                                            *******                                   *******


	 - Kai says you have some news, - Guy was standing on the top step of the porch, his mighty legs spread wide, smoking, his police cap slid on its side, he spoke calmly and not loudly. - What happened?
	 - Tonight, I'll tell you.
They had just finished their work, the afternoon was calm and stifling, the sun shone mercilessly from the clear, transparent sky.
	 - Hm. In the evening, so in the evening, - in the eyes of Guy, attention shone. - Is this about the kidnappers?
	 - About everything.
Rick reached the tram stop, waited for tram number four, and half an hour later entered the apartment's hallway. Laina was at home. She stood by the mirror, in a lilac sequined dress without sleeves, and straightening on her head a small, milky hat with a fluffy white feather. Laina did not have time to put on her shoes, her black high-heeled shoes, neatly placed on a shoe rack, patiently waited for her turn.
Rick kissed her, inhaling the soft, floral scent of her perfume, hugged her.
	 - You came home from work early today. I haven’t gone on duty yet.
	 - And very good, my soul. - he looked into her eyes and tried to smile at ease. - I was afraid not to find you.
	 - You won't get the car!
	 - My soul, but I need a car.
	 - I'll be late for the hospital! - Laina quickly looked at the small watch on her left wrist. - That's it, I'm already leaving.
	 - Little fox, I'll give you a ride to the hospital.
	 - Little fox. - she grinned in annoyance and took off her shoes from the stand.- And you are a fox!
	 - Laina, I urgently need a car.
	 - If urgent, then take it. Tomorrow morning, I'll take the tram. After the night shift.
	 - I'll pick you up in the morning.
They drove to the Second City Hospital - Laina was silent all the way, looking out the window, and Rick told her about Frou's trip to the capital, about Dick's intolerable character, and that the captain's character only gets worse over time.
She didn't seem to be listening to him.
When the car stopped at the steps of the emergency room stairs, Laina opened the door, silently got out of the car and, bending over, looked into Rick's face, said:
	 - I don’t like that you have secrets, Inspector.
She slammed the door so hard that Rick flinched.
For the next twenty minutes he wandered around the city, turned in the car into back alleys and looked in the rearview mirror. If the "tail" followed him, then certainly not by car, but by the broomstick of a medieval witch. After making sure that he was not being followed, Rick in a few minutes drove to the eastern outskirts of Quiet Harbor, passed the long fence of the river port, and drove the car along the federal highway.
Sown fields stretched to the left, a flat, green carpet stretched into the distance to the very horizon, and there a distant, tiny tractor crawled along it.
To the right stood a dense spruce forest, smooth, yellowed tree trunks flashed, and their gibsnst fluffy branches merged into a solid wall.
He overtook cars, without slowing down, slipped a short bridge over a stream running out of the forest, and after another ten minutes, he saw a narrow country road on the right. Rick pulled up, pulled onto a dirt road, and stopped.
No one followed him.
Then he drove forward into the forest, drove the car along a narrow path - the bushes on both sides hooked the car with their branches, it softly rolled over on the bumps, its springs creaked.
At this point, fir trees gave way to deciduous trees, dense and tall ferns covered the entire land.
Having reached a dead, old oak tree with a broken top sticking out with torn chips, he drove out to a place free of trees, drove the car under the branches of young aspens, and stopped.
He turned off the engine and got out of the car.
The forest was quiet, dark and solemn.
The sun was still shining, leaving in the west towards the horizon, but in the forest the coming evening became more noticeable, thick shadows lay under the trees, hiding dense bushes, turning the fern thickets into a magical, high flooring.
He stood motionless for a while, listening to the sounds of the dying forest, inhaling the smell of rotting leaves, then moved through the bushes, removing the branches from his face, walking and crushing the fern with his feet.
The place he knew was not far. Rick got there a few minutes later - near a tree that had fallen a long time ago, covered with moss and overgrown with toadstools, he began to unearth his secret.
The first time he came here, Rick brought a shovel with him and quickly dug a knee deep hole. Now the shovel was left lying in his abandoned apartment, and he had to wield a pocket, folding knife. Loosening the ground with a knife, he shook it to the side with his hands, kneeling, listening to the silence around him.
Finally, Rick had the tarpaulin parcel in which the tin box was wrapped. He did not leave immediately. Only after digging a hole and throwing last year's foliage on top, Rick headed back to the car.


                                                *******                                   *******



                                                                      Chapter five.


                                                                         Night trip.


He entered the kitchen, where an ignited primus was humming on a tin, enameled bedside table, and a kettle had been boiling on it for a long time — steam was beating in a misty stream towards the dirty window sill. Rick was drying his hands with Guy's long-uncleaned towel from the bathroom. A tarpaulin rag lying in the corner of the hallway spread the smell of damp earth throughout the apartment.
Guy and Kines sat at the table, shoulder to shoulder, leafing through an old notebook, old search sheets, with portraits drawn in pencil, lay on blank newspapers with which Guy had prudently covered the table.
Rick looked down at his hands - dirt was blackening under his nails. He somehow tidied up his police trousers, and now wet, dark spots were dark on them. Rick took off his shirt and hung it on the back of a chair, stood in trousers, naked to the waist and with a towel in his hands.
Guy and Kines looked at Rick, who entered the kitchen, at the same time.
	 - And you were silent about it!- Guy’s face expressed both delight and reproach.- I suspected for a long time. But so that this! …
	 - They won't leave you alone,- said Kines, calmly.- Be sure.
Rick went to the nightstand and put out the primus stove, then sat down on an empty chair against the wall, put a towel on the table.
Three sealed with sealing wax, bottles of vodka and three glasses, solemnly lined up against the wall, from the edge of the table.
An electric yellow lamp shone mattly under the ceiling, and beyond the curtained window, twilight deepened. The once-white curtains with green flowers were now gray and bore the marks of someone's greasy hands. The flowers were almost invisible.
	 - Turn on the radio,- Rick said, lighting a cigarette and pulling the saucer that served as an ashtray toward him.
	 - Oh yes! - Guy, groaning, got up, stretched out his hand to the black radio box hanging on the wall, and the space of the unkempt kitchen was filled with sounds, the voices of the announcer.
The announcer said something about the sea.
Guy sat down.
	 - Now tell me in detail!
And Rick told them everything.
He began his story with a meeting on the bus with the owner of an old notebook, then supplemented it with the fact of the death of this woman, who remained unknown to him. He told them about how Major Avs had met him for the first time, about talking to him in the car.
Guy and Kines listened to Rick without interrupting, and without asking him anything.
Rick was silent for a while, looking at the ember of his cigarette, and laid out to them the story that happened to him in the evening square. He, as he could, described to them the appearance of the doll, talking with his thoughts, told about his horror, and that he could not shoot then and how he even dropped his pistol.
Rick told his friends everything that had happened to him lately and, uttering words that could not find a way out for himself for a long time, now felt a strange feeling of joy that he had ceased to keep this secret in himself.
	 - I always knew that, - Guy looked at Rick with piercing eyes.- And you didn't believe me!
	 - If it were not for the guys I shot, and not this one - Kines tapped the open notebook with his index fingernail. - Then I would recommend that you visit a psychiatrist.
	 - I know, Kai.
	 - So they will hunt for this notebook until they get it!- Guy said.
He picked up one of the old, wanted lists, looked at it, then turned his gaze to Rick's face, and said:
	 - This is your grandfather.
	 - My grandfather.
	 - Sklim Yark.
	 - Yes.
	 - Rick, you are like two peas in a pod like your grandfather! Listen, I read about that once. People live their lives, die and then are born again, here in the Firmness! I would not believe it, but you yourself saw - you and your grandfather, one face!
Rick crushed the butt of his cigarette in a saucer and began to remove the sealing wax from the neck of one of the bottles with a knife, said:
	 - I am not my grandfather. That's for sure. Let's drink.
She and Guy drank vodka from dusty, faceted glasses, ate sandwiches with chopped, smoked ham prepared by Guy. Kines did not drink vodka, poured hot tea into his glass.
	 - We will discuss the aliens later, - Kines drank from a glass, noisily sucking in hot tea with his lips. - Rick, you risked a lot by going for this, - he nodded his head at the notebook. - It's a disastrous business. Have you seen their faces, at the colonel's? Such will not get rid of.
	 - I dashed around the city. Nobody followed me. And it is unlikely that after yesterday's case, they would again exhibit their people. It's too hot. They hesitate. They will not dare to do this for a long time.
Guy grinned in satisfaction, his reddened little nose now looked like a cherry laid on a round cake, his eyes radiated life and enthusiasm:
	 - That's right, Rick. That's for sure! There are already two corpses, their documents were lit up, the scandal was not weak. If they are caught spying on you again, the Central Prosecutor's Office will take the department of inquiry seriously. That's for sure.
Kines Grain carefully put his glass of tea on the table, took one from a pack of cigarettes, began to knead it with the fingers of his left hand, his gaze became thoughtful, he spoke:
	 - Once I saw lights in the sky.
	 - You?- Guy stared at him, stunned.
	 - Lights in the sky. This was just before my retirement. I was ferrying a fighter to an alternate airfield. At night. And I saw them. - He lit a cigarette, took a couple of puffs and continued. - I walked on the ceiling of the flight, the weather was clear. I don't know what made me look back. They flew to the right, like a garland of light bulbs, bright white bulbs. At first I took them for a bomber with strange marker lights, and then it quickly increased speed - really fast. It got up almost on my course, and stopped! The plane does not stop in flight. And this one got up. It hung for a few seconds, and suddenly a second later, he went up.- Kines grinned, looked at Guy, then at Rick. - He left at a great, prohibitive speed. A person there, would be smeared - from overloads - on the walls! I saw it. Personally. With my own eyes. Like this.- And he put a smoking cigarette in front of his nose.- You are the first to hear about this from me.
Everyone was silent for a minute.
	 - Interesting, - Rick lit his extinguished cigarette, winced from the tobacco smoke swirling around his face, began to speak. - What does it give us?
	 - Aliens on the Firmness!- Guy blurted out.- I always knew that.
	 - I knew. Okay. What does it give us, Guy, that is the question.
	 - Rick, that means ... So they're flying over our heads.
Rick smiled and said:
	 - And what should we do now?- He tapped an old notebook with his forefinger.- Next, what?
	 - Let's be consistent. - Kines shook the ashes from the cigarette in the saucer. - They hunt for the notebook. Your dolls need her, and the agents of the Inquiry Department are looking for her. The former have the ability and strength to take this notebook, but for some reason they do not want to do this. It’s strange. Why? The latter are simply not sure that you have it. I think this is a matter of the near future, Rick. The agents won't leave you alone.
	 - I think so too. The second time they will not fail, - Rick took a portrait of his grandfather in his hand, looked at the pencil drawing for a long time.- He was killed by agents of the Department of Inquiry. Now, the same office is hunting me.
	 - Destiny, Rick. What can I say?
	 - Guy, I believe that fate is the result of our actions. Not a pre-written plan of our life somewhere.
	 - Here's what I'm thinking, - Kines spoke in his usual manner, quietly and calmly. - Apparently, the dolls know about your every step. And these are not people, with people, to some extent, it is easier. And having the opportunity, they do not shake you. Why?
	 - Hmm. - Rick thoughtfully looked Kines in his gray, attentive eyes. - I thought about it. I do not know. Unclear. Apparently, there is something forbidding them to do this. I have no doubt that if they had come here now, they would have had the notebook.
	 - Exactly. It means that they cannot apply force to you, for some reason. Let's leave this point as a proven fact. What about the agents?
	 - These will show up,- Guy reached across the table for an open bottle of vodka, poured its clear liquid into two glasses, one gave to Rick, the other took himself. - We need to be together.
	 - I was just lucky that time, guys,- Kines crushed the butt of his cigarette in a saucer, took a glass of tea, drank half.- They were stupid. Overconfidence is punishable. Next time, these guys will do the right thing. And they can do it, Rick. And we cannot be together all the time. Do you want to give them this notebook?
	 - Not.
	 - Why?
Rick didn't answer for a long time. Looking at the smoking tip of his cigarette, he thought about this question. And really, why does he not want to get rid of this notebook? What's stopping him from just giving it away and forgetting all the troubles like a bad dream?
Vague, stifling feelings swirled in his soul.
He said:
	 - Because they always get what they want. They always take what doesn't belong to them. All these White castes, departments, these dolls. They play with us, as if we are puppets, manage, as in their own pocket. I won't give them the notebook! That doll ... She told me, "you have to obey." Obey! I don’t want to, you know? I don't want to be a doll for this doll! One has only to start obeying them, and it is not known what you will turn into later! It will snowball!
	 - Then expect surprises. If I were you, put it where I took it. If they removed the surveillance from you, they will soon begin to follow again where you are, what you are doing. I think they will definitely search your house. This will happen without fail.
Rick and Guy clinked their glasses.
	 - For you, Rick.
	 - For us.
They drank.
	 - I do not understand one thing, - Kines thoughtfully looked into Riku's face. - Why do these dolls, or what they are there, this notebook? Well, suppose everyone found out that besides the Farmness, there are other inhabited worlds. So what? This is news for one year at most. Then everything will subside. This means that the alien wrote something that can bring great changes in our world. Some kind of knowledge.
	 - Knowledge,- said Rick.- I think everything is subtler. Imagine that people suddenly find out that they are not unique in the universe. What follows from this?
	 - What?- Guy's eyes widened.
	 - And the fact that everyone who rules us, any boss, is not a unique type, like everyone else. No White castes, no kings and leaders. What can someone who is the same as me dictate to me?
	 - Hmm.- Kines chuckled.- This makes sense.
A music broadcast began on the radio, and Maki Jovi's husky voice began to sing about a beautiful spring morning, where "only you is not there."
	 - Rick. - Guy got very drunk, his greasy hair on his head, sticking out in bunches in all directions, he tried not to look Rick in the eyes. - You have Laina.
	 - As long as she doesn't know anything, she’s out of the game,- said Rick.- And she won’t know. Never!
Kines was about to say something, but said nothing.
	 - What?- Rick asked him.
	 - Nothing.
For about five minutes all three did not utter a single word. The hoarse voice of Usha Bely was heard from the radio, he sang about unhappy love, a high cliff and about the bad weather outside.
	 - We need to take the notebook back,- said Rick.
	 - When? Tomorrow? I'm with you, friend! - Guy's broad face expressed determination, big red palms clenched into fists. - We must act!
	 - Today. - Rick grinned. - This is the most reliable time.
Guy leaned forward, took the bottle with his right hand, and said:
	 - That’s out of the question!- He filled both glasses from the bottle with a firm hand.- Forget it. Not today.
	 - And when? You wanted to act.
	 - Today I am not able to.


                                              *******                                   *******


In the dim light of the electric lamp, the cramped space of the hallway in Guy's apartment seemed to be covered with a thick layer of dust.
Guy stood in front of Rick, opposite the bathroom door. He had already put on his shirt, but he was in no hurry to button up the buttons, and the wrinkled blue cotton shirt exposed his vast belly and hairy chest.
Guy tapped Rick's chest with his right forefinger, thick as a sausage, with a black, bitten nail, and repeated the same thing:
	 - We are dolls for them. We are dolls for them!
	 - Guy, wait for us, we'll be back soon, - Rick looked at Kines, who was standing at the front door, then at Guy.
	 - I? At home? Are you kidding? - Guy began tucking his wrinkled shirt into his trousers. - I'm with you! Kai!
	 - Will you go barefoot?
Guy Ool shook his shaggy head and began to put on his shoes. They watched in silence as he shoves his bare feet into his boots.
	 - Rick! And don't tell me. Don't tell me. - Guy suddenly became preoccupied with something, pushing Rick aside, walked into the dark room and returned a minute later, holding a nine-shot pistol in his hand. - Now let's go. Now everything is all right.
	 - You look like a bandit. - said Rick with a smile. - You and I will be arrested.
	 - Who? Police officers? Do not make me laugh. Let's go!
	 - Kai?
Kines replied succinctly:
	 - Hmm. This means that we will have three trunks.
They were already leaving the apartment, when suddenly Gai, remembering something, resolutely went to the kitchen, and came back with a sealed bottle of vodka.
In response to a silent reproach from Rick's and Kines' gaze, he also emphatically stated:
	 - This is for treating wounds!
	 - What wounds, Guy?
He frowned and said with pressure:
	 - For treating!


                                              *******                                   *******


Having finished the slow movement forward, the car buried its bumper in a dense bush, and froze. The bright light of her headlights reflected on every leaf of the illuminated bushes, making the wet leaves appear transparent. 
The rain had already ended, one could see how, in the rays of light, large drops of water were falling, sparkling, from the tree in front of them. Through the open driver's window, freshness and coolness were drawn into the car's interior, they diluted the suffocating and smoky atmosphere, bringing with them the smells of the forest.
	 - We didn't take the shovel,- Rick said, picking up a roll of tarpaulin with a tin box.- Wait for me here. I soon.
	 - Rick, maybe we'd better come with you?- Guy, as he could, turned in the front passenger seat to Rick, who was sitting on the couch.
	 - There’s no one here, Guy. Watch our rear. You never know.
Kines, sitting behind the steering wheel, smoked. He reached out to the dashboard and drowned out the engine - the headlights went out.
Rick got out of the car, holding the electric torch he had taken from Kines in his right hand, and a bundle under his left hand. Internally, prepared for the fact that he would have to get wet, making his way through the thickets of bushes, shaking off moisture from them, he moved forward. Branches climbed into his face, scratched his hands, his feet in boots got wet quickly and socks stuck disgustingly on his feet.
It was fresh and cool.
The night forest was asleep.
A narrow beam of light from his flashlight, trembled and jumped from side to side, Rick sometimes stopped to straighten the load sliding under his hand and look around, check if he had lost his way, whether he was keeping the right direction through the forest. By the light of a flashlight, dim and resting on the nearest bushes, everything around him became unrecognizable for him, as if Rick had never been here until this moment, and only looking at some tree, he recalled the place where he was now and with satisfaction noted for himself that he was going in the right direction.
The night bird perked up and, rustling its wings, flew over his head into the night.
Rick's shirt and trousers were soaked through.
He internally suppressed the fear of the dark that had arisen - primitive, unjustified. There could be no Inquiry Department agents here.
He knew it.
Making his way further, he remembered how they had a rest in this forest with the guys, remembered his unsuccessful fishing on the river bank, when he stepped on a fishing rod drunk and broke it, as Guy yelled because of this. Guy swore obscene words, he even kicked the bucket in his feelings and it, tumbling, flew into the water, and after sipping on water, it swam miserably there in the rays of the moon, as if asking for help.
He remembered Abrom Chloe, drunk and completely insane, how he opened fire with a pistol at the dark bushes, believing that there were bandits hiding there, and then Rick and Guy took the pistol from him, swore and shouted something obscene, and then, already by the fire, drinking vodka again, they soothed the crying Abrom, talked about friendship, that “there are no perfect people”, and Rick even went to the river bank and, finding the remains of his fishing rod, showed them to Abrom as a fact of his imperfection.
And then he remembered Abrom.
About another Abrom.
About the one that lay under the base of the tree - the eyeless Abrom, Abrom with an ugly grinning cut on his pale belly.
Rick shuddered.
With an inner effort, he made this image leave his imagination, knowing that this vision would not disappear altogether, that it still firmly stuck in his memory, and became one with what he remembered in his life.
Eyeless Abrom, looked at him from oblivion, with his ragged holes of large eye sockets, and disappeared.
Some disgusting sourness was thickening in Rick's mouth, he breathed a fume in front of him and, pushing the branches of the bush, thought about the fact that they had to drink in vain before this trip, because such things had to be done soberly, seriously, but not as they came here.
Having given his thoughts a strict course, he was relieved to notice a change in himself - fear began to leave, recede, replaced by feelings of reality - ordinary and simple, like their police station.
Rick made his way to the fallen tree and stopped.
He did not lose his way, he correctly determined where to go, and even congratulated himself on this.
He did not want to dig the wet earth.
Standing a stone's throw from the trunk of a tree lying in the thickets of a fern covered with matte moss, he shone a flashlight around him, looked around, and realized that something was wrong in the world around him.
Some detail was superfluous here.
He stared blankly at the nearby bushes, shone the light of a flashlight on the growing tree on the right, and once again looked in front of him.
He saw it.
Wood.
Or rather, a fragment of it, a tall, wet, black stump, with a flat, expanding crown. And two branches, symmetrically located on the sides of the stump.
Like hands.
Rick staggered back.
Extra tree.
Rick took a step back — slowly, trying not to make any noise. He moved the flashlight to his left hand, which was still holding the tarpaulin parcel to his side, and his right hand touched the holster, fingers sliding over the wet metal of the pistol, pulling it up.
There was a soft sound of the cocked trigger — "clack".
The tall stump came to life.
A faint beam of flashlight light slid up and illuminated the top of a tall stump - behind a high, black collar, a small, sham head in a black hat moved, a short body turned on thin legs, and Rick saw a white, sparkling enamel face.
The doll unhurriedly stepped over the trunk of the lying tree, and he saw her long legs covered with wet fabric, bent at the knees back, her hands hanging motionless along her body and small shoes, sparkling with black varnish, like outstretched hooves.
Rick was paralyzed. He gazed steadily into the doll's porcelain face, into the bulging eyes, and was filled with an icy, binding body, horror. He dropped the flashlight from his hand, the tarpaulin bundle at his fingertips, snagging on the handcuffs on his belt.
The doll moved slowly, she was in no hurry, her glossy face suddenly lit up from the inside with a soft green light, it quickly intensified and flared up into a pale green fire, from which the darkness lighted up in front of Rick, bright green glare sparkled on the fern leaves.
Rick could no longer raise his right hand with a pistol, it hung like someone else's, but the remnants of his dying will could make his index finger bend.
The doll had already stepped over the obstacle and moved towards him when a deafening shot rang out.
Rick saw the doll's eyeless face, glowing with a green glow, move closer to his. Her porcelain skin in an incomprehensible way folded at her small lips into a painted smile, and then he heard the voice of a doll in his head:
	 - It’s wrong to be here.
He gasped, a disgusting, cold shiver ran through his body, somewhere in a distant eternity, separated from real life, he heard a quiet whisper. Someone's words were confused in a web of viscous silence, but for some reason Rick decided that it was Abrom calling him, a living Abrom, somewhere from afar.
	 - Do you want to be like him? Do you want? Do you want Do you want Do you want? - the voice of the doll in his head changed the emotional color, pronouncing them in different ways. Now it was sympathy, then a threat, then she sneered, scoffed, laughed at his horror, and each time her intonations were wrong, sometimes too strong, sometimes inappropriate to the meaning of the words she uttered.- Abrom, Abrom, do you remember Abrom? Do you want to become like him? Do you want Do you want To lie down and not see? Do not see! Do not see!
Air sucked slowly through his teeth, filling his pain-burning lungs. Rick was gasping for breath, he could not breathe. He looked into the doll's porcelain eyes, surrounded by a green, cold light, and it seemed to him that he heard the rumble and scream of distant, unknown machines, which are drowning in the same green light, but many times brighter than this.
	 - Why not obey? Why be like Abrom Chloe? What for? What for? Will you obey?
Rick was shaking.
	 - Need to live. You will live? Will you? Will you? Will you? We can fix it. You do not need to turn on the fix, otherwise you will be like Abrom Chloe.
Rick's lips cramped, his face went numb, he couldn't say a word, couldn't scream, couldn't even hum. It was like his childhood nightmares. He tried to squeeze out a cry of despair, but this cry got bogged down and melted, somewhere between sleep and reality, and horror stuck to him like Velcro, and the dream did not end, delirium, terrible, painful delirium continued.
	 - She will cry. She will have no one to sleep with, because you will become like Abrom Chloe. Give it to us. We will leave. We will not be returning. You will sleep with her. You can see. Not like Abrom Chloe. Abrom Chloe. Abrom. Abrom.
There was a sound.
It was a real sound, a sound in this world - something big and massive, like a bulldozer, was pounding in his direction now, through the thickets of the nearest bushes, and Rick, without looking there, suddenly realized that under this rough and powerful onslaught, he was bending a young maple, and its uneven trunk, covered with smooth bark, crackles deafeningly, breaking and falling to the wet ground.
Rick couldn't turn away from the doll's face, couldn't move a single muscle.
Something big, not alive - Rick realized this in his suffocating delirium, approached, almost close to him, and stood behind his right shoulder.
	 - Give it to us, it will be ours. You do not need. The fat one will not go blind. The pilot will fly. Give it back, give it back to us. Tell me, I agree. Tell me, I agree. I agree. I agree. I agree! Say it!
The doll's words rang in his head with an unbearably piercing ringing, they stuck into Rick's mind with many sharp, red-hot needles.
What stood to his right hung over Rick's head, shone on him with a crimson, muffled light, and he realized, just as incomprehensibly as he heard a voice in his head, that this Something had a big, square head, without eyes and mouth.
	 - I must say, I agree. We will take what is not yours. We will leave for good. Tell me, I agree!
Something has changed.
Rick realized that now he could say, he could, because he was allowed. Sensitivity returned to his face, the paralysis of the lips disappeared, and he, already knowing his desire, as stifling and painful as the words of the doll, whispered hoarsely:
	 - Heir. I am the heir!
The doll pulled back. Her porcelain face, engulfed in light, did not flinch.
	 - Think. We will be back. We will be back. Think. Think.
The tension holding Rick began to weaken, and at the moment when the doll moved from him to the right, Rick heard the noise of voices and the crackle of breaking branches.
The doll, and the one standing above him, went to the right, he heard them wading through the thicket, going towards the nearby river, and for a moment all these noises and voices merged together, shots rang out, one after another.
	 - Kai, shoot!
More shots broke the silence.
Rick was able to turn his head to the right, where his tormentors had just gone, and there, in the darkness of the forest, he saw the reflections from the tree trunks - red and green, they were receding, losing their brightness and strength, and from there pistol shots rattled and thundered, and a voice Guy, carrying with a sharp echo, shouted:
	 - Shoot! Kai shoot it!
Rick breathed deeply, it seemed to him that he still could not breathe, could not extinguish the raging fire of pain in his lungs. He was shaking. A dim flashlight lay at his feet.
	 - Rick! Rick! - Voice of Kines.
	 - I'm here ... - Rick barely squeezed out this sound, and in his throat, something painfully clenched, he coughed loudly and hysterically.
He vomited.He stepped back, swayed and fell on all fours, looked at the flashlight lying at his left hand, tried to stop his coughing.
	 - Guy, he's here!
Someone's arms grabbed Rick, jerked him to his feet.
Kines.
	 - Stop!
Kines quickly picked up the gun and flashlight that had fallen from Rick's hand and pulled Rick away.
	 - Guy, here!
Guy was pounding through the thicket, now to Rick's left, twigs crunching and cracking. He appeared in front of Rick and Kines, shining his flashlight on them, shouting:
	 - I shot it point-blank! I shot …
	 - Let's drag him, quickly!
Rick saw what was happening like a dream.
Branches and leaves flicker in front of his face, ghosts of the light of flashlights in the hands of Kines and Guy, rush in front, something slaps him in the face, severely scratching his right cheek, and he runs on weak legs, picked up from both sides by Guy and Kaines, who interfere each other stumble and wheeze.
Soon they reached the place where their car was parked, drowning in wet ferns.
Kines drove along a forest road, towards the exit to the highway, and Rick drank from the neck of a bottle burning vodka liquid, and looked at Kynes's instrument-lit right ear, and listened to Guy's hoarse, loud, crazy voice:
	 - I shot it point-blank. In the head! In the head, damn it, shot! What is it, Rick? Are these the ones? Yes? Those?
Rick removed the bottle from his face and buried his nose in the wet sleeve of his shirt.
	 - The monster! It was a monster. And head, head! Square, red, glows ... Kai, drive!
Scratching the hump of the embankment with its bottom, the car flew out onto a dark road, swerved to the left and rushed straight, shining its headlights on the asphalt running under it.
Rick sat with his right cheek resting on the leather back of the driver's seat, staring out the windshield of the car.
He was silent.
There, in the light of the headlights, the night, lifeless road rushed towards them.



                                              *******                                *******


	 - We need to get rid of this notebook.- Kines said these words in a calm, even voice, looked out the windshield of the car, into the night.
They sped at great speed, the forest on both sides of the road, turned into high, gloomy walls.
	 - And how do you want to get rid of this notebook?
	 - Rick?
	 - Yes, - Rick's voice wheezed.
	 - We need to find a suitable place, guys, - Guy was striking a gas lighter, trying to light a cigarette. - Next weekend you can …
	 - Tomorrow they might start spying on us,- Kines said.- I know one quiet place, I think no one will get there.
	 - Are you crazy? We just barely left now!
Rick listened in silence.
The vodka relaxed his nerves, he began to calm down, but he was still nauseated - the doll's voice caused pain in Rick's mind, and now, like an echo from her words, fear shied away in him, nausea came to his throat.
“- Abrom, Abrom. Do you remember Abrom? "
	 - We need to hide it now, Guy. Then we will not have such an opportunity.
	 - And where?
	 - Not far from the old port, in an abandoned fire station.
	 - Kai, there is a private road, the guards will not let us in. Nobody should see us!
	 - There is no road. You are laughing? It is difficult to get there even on foot, and even more so by car!
	 - I passed there.
They drove on in silence.
In the semi-dark interior of the car, a fog of tobacco smoke tossed about - Guy was smoking a cigarette. A few minutes later, Kines slowed down, and the car, dodging backwards on the bend, turned left, rolled along a bumpy country road, tree branches flashed, headlights glided over the bumps and holes in which the night was hiding.
The forest on the left side became less frequent, sparks of stars flickered in the space between the trees, a cool wind blew in the open windows of the car.
	 - I shouldn't have got you into this, guys,- Rick said.
	 - This is life, buddy,- Kines told him.
Turning to the right, they left the forest behind, drove along an almost indistinguishable road overgrown with tall grass and rare bushes, the surviving road surface, like islets of former life, appeared from time to time - cracked, with pieces of old asphalt turned up, with deep, black pits filled with rainwater ... The stars shone with small lights in the night sky.
Crushing the grass, the car drove onto a gentle hill from where, wagging from side to side, bypassing the pits, rolled down the slope, and a faded strip of the river, barely visible in the darkness, and some black buildings against its background, and on the right, somewhere in the distance, flickering with lights, a distant, sleeping city.
Rick thought that since his hectic childhood years, he had never been to these places.
	 - The private road begins there, at the barrier, - Kai waved his hand to the side, to the right, into the night. - There is a house for security. Long away. We'll leave the notebook in the depot for a while, then we'll find a better place and hide it.
Finally, getting out of the bushes, the car drove a little more and, illuminating the old red-brick walls of the fire station with its headlights, stopped a few steps from the former garage.
The car fell silent.
Her headlights went out.
	 - Everyone's here, guys,- Kines said.
All three climbed out of the car into the transparent darkness of the starry night.
	 - We need to look around,- Kines said quietly.
They stood side by side.
	 - There is no one here, Kai. - Guy twisted his large head in the dark. - You have chosen a wild place.
	 - We have nowhere to rush. Rick, how are you?
	 - Fine.
	 - I'll check the road, and you and Guy go around the depot.
With that said, Kines Grain walked away towards the private road that he had told them about. Rick stared aimlessly at where Kines had disappeared in the darkness.
Rick and Guy went their separate ways.
It was quiet here, somewhere not far away a lonely cricket chirped, coolness was drawn from the nearby river, and it smelled of wormwood. Rick walked slowly. Peering into the darkness, he barely made out the outlines of a nearby fire station building and two black trunks of tall trees, listened to the world around him, but heard no sounds except the rustling of his own feet on the grass.
This place, indeed, was abandoned long ago by people. He wondered how old this fire station was. Fifty? Seventy years old?
In the west of this wasteland there were once the Black Quarters of Quiet Harbor, but more than half a century has passed since then - the city has been rebuilt after the last war, already in its present place. Only the thin "ribs" of the foundations from the disappeared barracks, dilapidated by time, overgrown with grass and bushes, remained of the Black Quarters. People have forgotten these places, and these places have forgotten about people.
Rick moved in the dark, inwardly struggling with the fear of bumping into, face to face with the doll - "it's wrong to be here." He often stopped and, looking around, listened to the silence surrounding him.
A weak, timid wind blew from the side of the river.
Rick was about to walk to the opposite side of the depot when the massive figure of Guy stepped out of the darkness towards him.
	 - Rick, there is no one here, - Guy said these words in a quiet, strangled voice. - We return to the gate. We hang around here like three cretins. And we only need five minutes for this.
	 - Why are you talking in a whisper then?- Rick smiled drunkenly at Guy’s face, barely visible in the darkness.
	 - Everything is fine with you, I watch.
They went back to the entrance to the gloomy garage of the fire station, stopped at the fallen gates, rotten and overgrown with grass, waiting for Kines to return.
	 - You could have hidden it at my house,- Gai grumbled.- No one will come to me. I want to smoke, I have no strength.
	 - You will endure.
	 - All my life, I endure something. And after tonight, I will also be afraid of the dark. Damn them, these dolls. Where did they come from, then?
	 - I do not know.
	 - Kai somewhere, got lost.
	 - I'm here, - Kai suddenly came out to them, on the left, approached and, passing between Rick and Guy, entered the darkness of the garage. - Do you have a notebook?
	 - In the car,- Guy told him.
Kines left in the direction of a nearby car, then returning silently entered the garage and there turned on an electric flashlight - a dim, yellow light flooded the spacious room of the former garage of the fire station. Grass stuck out of cracks in the stone slabs stacked on an uneven floor; on one side of the room stood a rusty carcass of a passenger car, without wheels, with an empty interior that had been gutted by someone. Rick could not determine the make of the car, but judging by the sloping, metal roof, this car could not have been released from the assembly line half a century ago. On the other hand, a few steps from the abandoned car, heaped up a pile of rubbish - boards, a rectangular wooden table top from the table, a rusty piece of tin, some kind of rags.
	 - Let one of you stand at the entrance,- Kai said calmly and, placing his flashlight on a brick ledge in the wall, he put the canvas bundle on the floor and, grasping the board, pulled it aside.
Rick began to help him, and Guy stood like a pillar in the gateway.
	 - Someone happens here, Kai.
	 - Tin cans at the entrance?
	 - And this car is comparatively old.
	 - Some tramps. Has long been. And this car is ten years old, no less.
	 - Are you sure about the reliability of this place?
	 - I'm sure. I have my own cache here. If you only knew, Rick, what I kept in it!
They cleared a corner of the brick walls from the rubbish, and Kines, taking a penknife from his trouser pocket, squatted down in front of the wall, and expertly inserted the blade of the knife into the gap between the bricks.
After a couple of minutes, he removed four bricks from the wall, and Rick saw the spacious, rectangular space of the cache.
	 - This place is no worse than any other place.- Kines got to his feet and brushed off his trousers on his knees, smiled at Riku, his bright eyes flashed.- She will lie here for a thousand years.
"A Thousand Years".
“It's long enough for us, Kai.
And Rick picked up the bundle from the floor, which hid his notebook, handed it to Kines Grain.


                                             *******                                     *******


                                                                    Chapter six.


                                                                    "Must obey."


The working day was over - it was getting dark.
Everyone was waiting for Duk Schopeller, who had left for the police department. And so he returned - silent, solemn, walked into Dick's office, and a minute later looked out of it into the "corral", saying:
	 - Come on in, guys.
Both officers and sergeants crammed into the captain's office, stinking of tobacco, huddled near the table, on which lay the expert's open leather folder. It contained several sheets covered with typewritten text, from under which the corners of black-and-white photographs were sticking out.
	 - Begin, Duk,- said Dick, puffing on his cigarette.
Duk began to speak:
	 - And so, now we know who to look for, guys, - he took out several photographs from the folder and handed them out to the police, then began to read what was written on a sheet of paper with a bold stamp in the corner - "for investigators."- There are three of them. They are patients of the Kamennaya Gora closed psychiatric clinic. And they escaped. You should have heard about this, it happened last spring. They killed two more orderlies, wounded the guard and killed the doctor on duty.
	 - Stone Mountain, far from here,- Sergeant Pei grumbled.
	 - Long away. So. Doddsa Mreyk, 32 years old, she is not married, she has no children, was in the clinic for indefinite treatment, by court order. Four proven murders, with extreme cruelty. She easily enters into trust, and she is extremely dangerous. Sluk Bars, 30 years old, he is divorced, four murders and an arson attempt. Zhong Sov, 36, single, three proven murders, artistic. This type killed his victims in his sleep. The guys in each photo, there are their special signs and height. This is an extremely dangerous audience. The District Attorney believes that the murder of the two postmen and the theft of their weapons is the business of these three bastards. Tomorrow all patrols in the city will have their photos.


                                                *******                                   *******


	 - And you want me to go to Dick’s with this?- Rick calmly looked into Kines’s eyes as he sat on the edge of his desk, dumping the ashes into the overflowing ashtray.
In his office, besides Rick himself, were Kines Grain and Guy. Kines stood by the tightly closed window, exuding a subtle, floral scent of expensive cologne, his cream-colored trousers were impeccably ironed, and his green sleeveless shirt contrasted sharply with his bright red tie. His white shoes shone with cleanliness, and in general, against the background of Rick's office, Kynes seemed like an alien from another world.
To some extent, it was so.
Guy stood against the wall opposite the table, leaning against the wall and thrusting his massive hands into his trouser pockets. Like Rick, he was part of this police station - dusty, messy and smoky. Guy's blue shirt exposed his mighty neck, due to the lack of two top buttons.
	 - It's up to you,- said Kines, and shrugged his shoulders.- It's my job to say so.
They were silent.
	 - Let's start over. - Rick lit a cigarette from a gasoline lighter and threw it on the table in a heap of scribbled papers. - What do we have? Shorty May's guys came up to you and said that he was going to turn over Little Doddy's gang to us. So?
	 - So.
	 - Yeah.- Rick blew a jet of tobacco smoke into the gray, dusty ceiling of the office.- They're making an appointment for us. This night. Near the stadium. If believe them, then Mei will personally come to us.
	 - If they are to be believed,- Kines confirmed.
	 - If they are to be believed.
Guy, who had been standing motionless before, came to life, he stepped to the table and took a lighter from it, pulled out a pack of cigarettes lying by the ashtray, one cigarette, said doubtfully:
	 - Something all this, somehow it turns out smoothly. May gives us a gang of psychos, just like that, out of the kindness of her heart. He himself, he is still crazy, this Mei. And then, how do we know that we are not being led by the nose? Maybe these guys have the same relationship to May as I have to the Mayor's wife. Now this little bitch, Doddy, is sitting somewhere in a bar, with her scum, and is waiting for the night to let the guts out of us. She is no longer interested in one police corpse, but to lay down two or three at once - this will make noise. She will go down in history, damn it.
	 - They're definitely May's guys,- Kines said calmly.- I know one of them. This is Dean Squok, May's bookmaker's henchman. I guarantee.
	 - Could this Squok go over to Doddy's side? May's empire is crumbling, warehouses are cracking from searches, most of the brothels have been closed, pimps cry behind bars, bookmakers ... The guys are unhappy. BUT?
	 - I don’t think so, Rick. I don’t think so.
Time dragged on slowly towards dinner. In the sunlight outside the office window, their windows shone brightly, passing along the road, cars. Passers-by went somewhere on their business.
	 - Well, okay.- Rick crushed the cigarette butt in the ashtray.- He wants to hand them over to us. So be it. Okay. Throws their heads at us so we can leave him alone. With this, everything is clear.
Rick fell silent.
He didn't like the whole idea.
	 - Mei set a strict condition - no noise. If they notice that the police are cordoning off the block, there will be no meeting.
	 - And the block will be cordoned off, - said Rick confidently. - Do not go to the fortune-teller.
	 - We need Dick. If something happens then he will cover us.
	 - Guy, if something happens, then our asses will be in the city morgue in the morning. This is "if that".
	 - And if it turns out, some kind of dirty trick, then we will find ourselves behind bars.
	 - That's for sure.
	 - But these bastards must be taken by ourselves! Otherwise they will not see the gallows.
	 - There are three of them. Maybe four. - Rick looked at Guy, then at Kines. - Kai, how are you?
	 - You didn't have to ask.
	 - There are three of us. Fru disappears. Mirol is a jerk. This is a bad balance of power. We only have pistols from weapons, and we cannot take machine guns.
	 - Let's take the guns from the car,- Guy said.
	 - We will not pull this case three together. This is out of the question, guys.
	 - Rick. - Guy approached him, almost close, a cigarette sticking out of the corner of his mouth, spoke abruptly. - They will hide them in a madhouse. Nobody will hang them.
	 - We're few.
	 - The brother of that murdered sergeant, from the second precinct - I saw him. He asked that if we find out about the killers, we will inform him. He and his brother served in that station, he is also a sergeant. I think that those wishing to participate will be.- Guy looked Rick in the face, did not look away. - Rick, they have to pay for Abrom. And then. Today we will find out what this bastard Mei will tell us, and tomorrow we will decide what to do.
	 - You have to tell Dick about this,- Kines said. - We need his cover. But we will not be able to conduct business officially right away. As soon as the department becomes aware of this, they will disrupt the meeting.
	 - Yes. Major Fomo is a very energetic guy. Okay. To begin with, we can find out what May will tell us, and then we will think about how to deal with it. But we need Dick.
	 - Dick, this is a question. - Guy grinned wryly. - Big question.
	 - Okay, let's go.
A minute later, all three - Rick, Guy and Kines were standing in Dick School's office. Kines Grain closed the door behind him.
Dick, he was writing something on a sheet of white paper with his head bowed and biting his lower lip. His gray, shabby hat lay at the very edge of the table, threatening to fall to the floor. 
Dick's office was smoky and smelled of long-worn socks.
Dick looked at the newcomers, at the sight of Kines, he first looked in surprise at the private detective, then, assuming a commanding air, greeted him dryly and asked Rick:
	 - What do you want?
	 - Dick, we need your help.
	 - My help. And how can it be without me? I'm still busy.
	 - Abrom,- Rick said quietly, and the captain put down the ink pen and looked at him warily.
	 - What?
And Rick told him about Shorty May's proposal, but he didn't mention the meeting place for tonight.
Dick picked up the phone, his eyes came to life:
	 - Where does he want to meet with us?
	 - You don’t understand, Dick. You cannot call the office. They will ruin everything, there will be no meeting, and we have almost nothing on this case!
	 - Rick, I asked you where they made an appointment for us?
	 - Listen, Dick. The three of us will go to the meeting, find out what May wants to tell us about this Doddy, and then we will decide what to do. If something goes wrong, you will cover us.
	 - What?- Dick's face changed from self-confidence to confusion, but only for a few seconds. Slowly, putting the telephone receiver on the black telephone, he slowly and with determination asked, looking into Rick's eyes.- What, what are you telling me? Well, well, well, in more detail.
	 - If things don't go as we expect, then you will say that we were carrying out an official investigation.
	 - You're a smart guy, Rick! You're a bloody smart guy. Have you been a lieutenant for a long time, probably missed the job of a sentry sergeant?
Rick sat down on a chair in front of the captain's table, said:
	 - They’ll break the deal, Dick. We won't know anything …
And then Guy, who had been silent before, intervened in the conversation:
	 - That should be our business, Dick. Only ours. Let's punish the bastards for Abrom. You were friends with him. You will cover us, and we will arrange everything.
Dick looked at Guy.
Dick was surprised.
	 - What?
	 - We will punish them for Abrom.
	 - Listen, you are a fan of knocking over a glass at the service! I didn't hear that, Guy. You didn't offer me that. Either you tell me where the meeting is scheduled, or get out of my office! And remember, I will not cover anyone. And remember, if you get yourself into shit, you will answer! Grain, you made this mess. Why are you hanging around in my precinct? I can arrest you right now, and I don't care who you are eating vodka with! Got it? Where will they be waiting for you?
	 - You took his Suma from the hospital with him!- Guy's face turned red, he had never raised his voice to Dick before, but now everything was different - he almost broke into a scream.- You were his friend, Dick! Friend. Every year you sat in their house, ate shish kebab and babysit Chems. All you need is that you …
	 - Shut up, Guy!
	 - You are no longer the Dick you used to be. What, is this all over your eyes?- Guy grabbed several papers on Dick’s desk with the fingers of his right hand and shook them in front of his face.- That's what you've become, Dick. They scattered Abrom's guts around, they cut out his eyes! And you are a rag, for the sake of a friend you cannot lift your butt. Or did you always pretend to be his friend? Or are you just one of those who like to flutter your tongue at parties and eat other people's pies?
And Dick jumped up from his chair.
He shouted at Guy, angry and furious, his cheeks shaking with fury.
	 - Get out of my office, you drunken mattress! I said get out!
Guy silently turned to the door, preparing to leave.
	 - And you, Grain, if I see you here again …
Guy left the office, Kines followed him. Rick got up from his chair and said to Dick before leaving his office:
	 - There are no more  for us, Dick School's. Just know about it, captain. You are a "cap".
Rick moved through the open door, and Dick School yelled in his back, at the top of his voice:
	 - Just dare to stick your nose in there! You will all fly out of the police! I won't lift a finger! I'm going to put you all in jail, to hell! A gang of idiots. Rick! Rick! You’ll put your badge on the table for me! I'll hide you all behind bars! …


                                               *******                                  *******

	 - And I am not a cap.
Semi-darkness reigned in the cabin, the switched off instruments on the dashboard under the steering wheel were drowning in darkness. Dick sat in the front passenger seat, pistol in his right hand, and stared straight ahead through the windshield.
	 - Dick, we've already discussed everything,- said Rick apologetically.
He kept both hands on the steering wheel. He put his pistol next to him. Rick glanced at the captain - he seemed thoughtful.
	 - I've always been with you guys. Always. Guy, I'm sorry.
Guy, who was sitting on the sofa, answered him from the darkness:
	 - And you will excuse me. Hmm.
They had been waiting for over an hour.
To the right of their car stretched a wasteland overgrown with tall grass, along which a straight asphalt road lay at night, leading to the stadium, towering behind the wasteland, a gloomy, tall structure without lights. Only a large signpost, dotted with multi-colored electric lamps, forming an arched word - "stadium", brightly illuminated the intersection and part of the dirt embankment behind the road. And, somewhere out there, in the night, now Kines Grain was hiding with his sniper rifle.
To the left stood a one-story building, lined with red brick, with a low canopy over the front door, on its wall, illuminated from the inside, a poster with a painted horse and a naked busty horsewoman was glowing. At the very entrance to the institution, there was a heavy, plaster urn.
The road went straight, beyond the crossroads, and was lost in the pitch darkness, there were no longer any lights, only the edge of the sky, marked by points of stars, rested against the blackness of the firmness.
	 - We are a good target for them. Here's what.- Dick said, and Rick heard the concern in his voice.- Kines won't miss?
	 - He is a former military man. He won't miss.- Guy answered him.
	 - We sit here like …
Rick looked ahead, said:
	 - He has a good position. We are illuminated. But I don't think there is a trap here.
	 - Damn it all. I do not like it when like this!
	 - Nobody likes.
Dick suddenly laughed softly.
	 - Why are you laughing?- Guy asked him.
	 - Remember how we took the Shaggy gang?
	 - When did Musley Davs shit?- Guy chuckled loudly.
	 - Yes. Exactly Davs. I already forgot his name. Davs, Musli Davs.
	 - Shitass Muesli.
	 - What's that got you into memories?- Rick chuckled.
Dick sighed, replied:
	 - How many years have passed. Just now I remembered.
	 - Twenty years, as if it has passed, - said Gai quietly. - We were all patrolmen then.
	 - Twenty years, damn it.- Dick sighed again. - A lifetime.
They sat, looking around at the windows of the salon, were silent and listened as somewhere in the vacant lot a cricket snapped, calling his girlfriend to a meeting for love.
Guy lit a cigarette.
The coolness of the night entered the open windows of the car.
	 - Laina's car?- Dick asked.
	 - Yes. I will never make money on this.
	 - Yes. With our salaries ... Does she know?
	 - Not. She asked not to scratch the car.
	 - Heh, all women are the same. Well, I mean, they love order. Y-yes. Of course, a doctor can afford it. Is she at home or at work now?
	 - She's on duty tonight.
	 - The main thing is not to add her a job today.- Dick spat out the window.- I hate sitting like this,” he paused, looking into the darkness outside the window, then said thoughtfully.- I dreamed about Abrom today.
Nobody supported this topic and Dick shut up - lit a cigarette and silently smoked out the window.
Then Dick spoke again:
	 - If Mei nevertheless hands over these psychos to us, then the case will need to be finished faster. Tomorrow I’ll send machine guns to the armory, and we’ll take Shock and Tresley with us. There will be six of us already. Rick.
	 - What?
	 - Who were the guys Kines killed?
Rick had been waiting for a long time for Dick to ask him this question, and calmly replied:
	 - I have no idea.
	 - You have no idea. Uh-huh. That's why I'm asking you this, Rick. In the papers sent from the department, only three psychos are mentioned. Three. Where did two more come from then? Yes, besides, with fake documents. This makes it all too complicated.
	 - So there were more of them.
	 - There were more of them,- Dick, who had previously looked straight ahead, turned his head sharply towards Rick, said with a grin in his voice.- So you don’t know.
	 - Dick, if you want to know my opinion, these were the types from the little Doddy's gang. I don't believe in coincidences.
	 - And what is your opinion, they looked like psychos?
	 - They did not salivate. There are psychos who can only be seen when you put a knife in their hands, Dick! And if not for Kai, I would have been found just like Abrom's.
Dick turned away, was silent for a moment, then said thoughtfully:
	 - So now there are three of them.
	 - If not more,- Guy grumbled from the darkness.
Silence formed in the car again.
And then Guy said:
	 - We have guests. Behind.
Rick took his pistol and looked back, looked out the rear window of the cabin. A car rolled slowly along the dark road with its headlights off. When she reached the turn sign, she froze. He heard her engine humming rhythmically.
	 - There are two ahead!- Dick croaked, and coughed.
Out of the pitch darkness, onto a dimly lit by a billboard, a section of the road, two cars drove out and stopped about fifty paces from the police. The headlights of these cars were also off.
	 - It began, - said Rick. - We sit and wait for the invitation.
	 - They cut us off from the city. If that we can retreat to the stadium.
	 - If anything, Dick, we will be shot right here. - Rick looked at the cars frozen in the middle of the road. - Guy, what's behind?
	 - I look, I look.
About three minutes passed in agonizing anticipation, and then the door of one of the cars opened and a man in a dark suit got out of it, and walked in their direction with a calm step. He held his hands, spreading them to the sides - he was unarmed. He approached from the side of Dick, and said in a low voice:
	 - I am unarmed, gentlemen. They want to talk to you. You will have to leave your weapon behind.
Dick put his pistol on the dashboard and opened the door. Rick did the same.
	 - If anything, guys, I won't let them go,- Guy said.
Accompanied by the stranger, Dick and Rick set off towards the nearby cars.
	 - We play fair.- Dick looked at the escort.
	 - Otherwise there would be no meeting.
They approached the cars, the stranger opened the back door of one of the cars in front of the police.
Without a gun, and even in such a situation, Rick felt lousy. A man in a dark suit quickly and deftly searched both police officers, then nodded his head.
First Dick, and then Rick after him, climbed into the dark interior of the car, and Rick closed the door behind him.
In the front seat, there was a short man in a dark hat, the driver looked like a giant in comparison with him, his head almost touching the soft skin of the roof.
	 - Armie, go for a walk, - calmly said the passenger to the brute driver, and he silently climbed out of the passenger compartment into the night. - Hello, gentlemen. Frankly speaking, I am somewhat at a loss that I have to talk to you. I think that you are also not delighted with our meeting.
	 - That's right,- Dick told him.
	 - But we have a common business, an unexpected business that requires a speedy resolution. If I understand correctly, Captain School and Lieutenant Yark?
	 - There are only private individuals here.
	 - Okay. Just call me - Mei. I am a simple person.
Rick thought that this seemingly harmless, already aging man had a collection of cut off ears of his enemies somewhere. If the rumors are to be believed.
	 - Dick.
	 - Rick.
	 - Excellent. I don't fight with the police. I have my own business, you have yours. But lately, my affairs, to put it mildly, have gotten out of control. I am losing money. But this is a trifle compared to the damage that my reputation has suffered. In our business, reputation plays a key role, and if you are not respected, then you are a corpse.
	 - These scum ... - began Dick, and stopped.
	 - Bastards, - Mei agreed with him. - They do not know how to play, they do not want to respect anyone, they take not theirs. This is bad. And they also don't value human life.
«Human Life».
	 - We have accidents with the police, but this can be explained by the peculiarities of our and your work.
Rick chuckled at the dark profile of Shorty Mei. The words about "work" amused him.
	 - And most importantly, we have the rules of the game. And everything is under control. But now ... I'm upset. I have to do things that are unpleasant for myself.
	 - I see,- Dick muttered.
	 - I see,- Mei repeated, and was silent for a long time. Then he spoke again,- You can't spill blood like water. People suffer for nothing.
	 - They’ve killed many and will kill many more.- Dick spoke in an even, calm voice.- They are crazy.
	 - I know. They are nobody, ordinary clowns who decided that they had the whole Firmness under their feet. They decided that they could win over my guys to their side. I don't like it when they say nasty things about me behind my back. I didn't deserve this. And who is speaking? Hmm. Now they began to badly guard the abnormal. Previously, they were simply hung up. Where is this world heading? They can cut people in broad daylight, and they will not be hanged for it. Why is that? What's up with this world? When I ask myself this, I don’t find the answer. All of this is not correct. These bastards don't know what's right and what's wrong. And so, gentlemen, let's get down to business. My guys tracked these bastards three days ago. They change their place of residence every night, spend the night in abandoned houses and are not very careful. In their position, this is stupid. And stupidity is punishable. I could have put their heads in a bag a long time ago, but that would not solve all my problems. Rumors began to spread in the city that all these killings, including two policemen, were the work of my hands. Allegedly old man May has gone mad. But with my head, everything is in order. Therefore, I decided that it would be better if I pass these idiots to you and close this issue once and for all.
	 - Okay.
	 - Okay. Hmm. As I understand it, gentlemen, you are not going to arrest them.
	 - Let’s see according to the circumstances,- Dick answered him.
	 - According to circumstances. The circumstances are not good. You are few, and you will have to take them today, because I cannot graze them further for you. My people, to put it mildly, already look at this whole story with a bad look.
	 - Where are they hiding?- Rick asked him.
Mei didn't answer right away.
	 - There are nine of them,- he said, thinking,- There are four of you, along with the bloodhound Grains, who is lying in the wasteland with a rifle. If they interrupt you, then tomorrow all the newspapers will trample my name in the mud. My guys will go with you. The assholes in my city must be done away with today.
"In my town".
Rick grinned into the surrounding darkness, and thought, but how much is left to Mei himself, until the moment when they will finish with him? And, most likely, for Mei's ears, somewhere prepared a jar with the inscription "you are with us forever."


                                                  *******                             *******

The road remained somewhere far away, behind a dark, flattened hill, on the right side of the lake. Stretching out in a long chain in the darkness, moving along an invisible path, one by one, one after another, they bypassed the dense thickets of reeds growing as a solid wall in this part of the lake, teeming with loud-voiced frogs. The nearby water breathed dampness and coolness, the smell of rotting algae mixed with the scent of flowers. The faint light of the crescent moon barely illuminated the outline of Kines's figure walking in front of him. His black hat floated in front of Rick like a pointed, dark spot, and on the long barrel of the sniper rifle that dangled behind the private investigator, with every movement of Grain, the dull reflections of the moon flashed.
The uterine voices of frogs resounded throughout the area, a weak wind rustled through the thickets of reeds.
Here was the kingdom of mosquitoes - Rick's face, neck and arms unprotected by short sleeves of a shirt, itched from mosquito bites.
Their strange detachment moved slowly, people tried not to make noise. They walked in the dark without turning on the lanterns.
The thickets of reeds broke off, giving way to a rare bush, undersized, as if someone had trimmed it. Ahead three willows towered, like giants asleep, they were darkening at the very shore of the lake, long branches bent to the water. On such a clear night, any little light can be seen from afar, and Rick, peering out from behind Kines, peered into the darkness in front of him, trying to make out the slightest glimmer of light, but he could not see any signs of approaching housing yet.
The wind blew from the right, along with fearless hordes of mosquitoes.
The cloudless, transparent sky opened the eyes of the thin sparkles of stars.
To the left was a hill, with a tall, gnarled tree growing on its flat top.
Rick remembered the details of his conversation with Mei.
Shorty Mei.
Psychopath Mei.
Rick involuntarily began to think that all the words of this bandit are lies, and that they are being led to kill innocent people.
The socks at Rick's ankles are wet - the dew is already on the grass.
They saw the house somehow immediately, and unexpectedly for Rick. Kines stopped abruptly and Rick nearly collided with him. Puffing like a locomotive, Guy walked around Rick on the right, and stopped nearby, whispering hoarsely in his ear:
	 - Here.
There were no more than two hundred steps left to the house drowning in the night. In the impenetrable darkness, because of the broken-off thickets, two windows faintly glowed with yellow rectangles, in the light of the Moon the roof ridge glittered gray, and immediately behind it began a black forest, hushed, mysterious. The tops of the trees stuck out against the starry sky like an impenetrable, gloomy fence.
	 - I want to smoke, - Guy whispered to him hoarsely, and spat to the side. - Everything is baked inside.
A figure stepped out from behind Kines, and his voice, quiet and even, said:
	 - We act as agreed. The guys and I take over the windows and doors. As soon as the shooting starts, ours will drive the cars to the house.
	 - I see,- Rick replied.
They went forward again, turned to the left and moved along the thick bushes that drowned out a low, poorly distinguishable in the dark, hedge of rotten picket fence.
Rick remembered this house.
About two years ago, he and Guy and Abrom were already here. An old, one-story, long-abandoned house of a bankrupt farmer. A vagabond was killed in this house, and they came to the scene of the crime. An ordinary farmhouse, built of beams and planks, with a rotten roof and an equally rotten wooden porch. Once upon a time someone's hopes lived here and everyday life was in full swing, but then it was all over, the owners left, leaving their entire household to perish. On that porch, Rick almost fell - a dilapidated step broke under his foot, and now, walking behind Kines, he tried to remember which step it was.
Instead of details about a broken porch step, his wayward memory for some reason showed his fall from a distant childhood. Rick remembered how he, as a boy, ran from a sandy cliff towards the river bank and, stumbling, rolled down, tumbling over his head. He even remembered how the sand creaked on his teeth.
The house, long abandoned, was dumb and blind, otherwise the guard dog would have long ago notified its owners about the approach of guests.
From the wide open window, which was closer to the corner of the house, came the hoarse sounds of a gramophone - music played. Walking behind Kines, Rick peered into the darkness, pulling a pistol from his belt holster as he walked. The window farthest from the corner of the house was covered with a light-colored cloth, and a faint light penetrated through it. In the second window, he saw an indistinct figure leaning against the window frame - a man was talking to someone, and behind him were the details of a wretched interior, a black cabinet, a picture in a gray frame slanting on the wall, and a kerosene lantern suspended from the ceiling.
Rick saw a dark canopy over the porch, to which there were no more than twenty or thirty paces, went around the fence, and immediately heard a sharp, loud exclamation.
Fire blazed on the low porch of the house, a flash of light illuminated the figure of the gunman, and the roar of the shot deafened the sleeping silence. In response, from the side of May's people, a short burst of automatic weapons rang out, and immediately there were the sounds of steps of shooters running towards the house, black figures flashed on both sides of Rick. A man looked out of the window, a pistol in his hand spattered with fire and the noise of a shot into the night. The night came alive with screams and the roar of machine-gun fire, choking, hysterical. Rick ran forward.
He noticed how Kines crouched down, fired his rifle through the window and the man with the pistol, silently folded in half like a rag doll, fell on the windowsill and froze.
Rick ran onto the porch of the house, grabbed the cool handle of the door with his left hand and, jerking the door open towards himself, already tumbled into the hallway, into the dazzling light of a kerosene lamp standing on a low table, the sound of a gramophone met him with chords of trumpets and the languid voice of the singer:
	 - My heart is with you...
He stumbled over the door sill and stumbled into the hallway, trying to keep the sight of the dancing figure of a man in a gray suit in front of him. The man jerked and swayed, dancing some wild dance, dark spray flew out of his chest, bullets tore the fabric of his jacket on his trembling back, chips flew from the boardwalk into the room, and alarmed dust, rushed in cloudy clouds, glowed in the light of the lamp.
Rick was falling.
He shot at a man, who appeared in the doorway, dressed in something black, and saw how, simultaneously with his shot, a sawed-off shotgun twitched in the man's hands, a shot rattled, fire flashed, and the shooter himself immediately bent down and sank to the floor …
Rick fell on his right side, and Guy was already standing over him, huge as a rock, shooting with two hands, and thick-snouted pistols in his hands were spitting fire and bullets.
Someone's figure to the right by the window, fell backhand like a stick.
Trying to jump to his feet, he fired three more bullets into the open door, and there, in the flickering of shadows, smoke and ghostly light, he heard someone's heart-rending, desperate cry …


                                              *******                                    *******


	 - Damn bitch. - Dick stood over the woman, legs wide apart, the pistol he still held in his right hand, lowering it with the barrel down. - You're in deep trouble..
The surviving inhabitants of the abandoned house were five - a woman and four men, they were all handcuffed and dragged into a dusty large living room, where only a bulky, oak table covered with fresh newspapers and an old bookcase with curved, carved legs, standing in the very corner of the room, by the window.
One of the guys, handcuffed, was wounded in the right leg, the dark brown fabric of his trousers on his thigh was wet and blackened, he winced in pain and moaned softly.
Nobody was going to bandage him.
Rick stood next to Guy, near the door leading to the corridor, next to him were three of Mei's guys, two more, in the dim light of a kerosene lamp put by someone on the table, loomed at the entrance to the hallway.
Kines Grain did not enter the room, he stood in the doorway, the pistol in his right hand gleamed like dark steel, and a young man in a gray tracksuit sitting a step away from him, with his hands behind his back, grunted angrily:
	 - Bloodhound. Death will get to you too.
	 - But I got to you earlier,- Kaines said with a smile.- Didn't I?
Through the open door leading to the hallway, two young men walked in one after the other.
	 - Everything is clear in the yard,- one of them said, looked at those sitting on the floor, and said, addressing the guy wounded in the right leg.- Hello, Eul. Old Mei wants to discuss matters with you. He has questions for you, boy. Get up.
	 - Wooley, listen, - the wounded man spoke quietly but confidently. - Mei will die soon. He has already turned into a redneck. He wants to eat everything alone. We can take matters into our own hands, share the income honestly. None of the guys will be left behind.
	 - Get up, Eul. I don't want to get dirty.
	 - They'll finish him off anyway!- The wounded man said these words with unexpected despair in his voice.
	 - Roxx, get him in the car,- Wooley grinned wryly. "He's going to have a difficult night tonight.- And you Heck, - he looked at the blond guy sitting next to the woman,-  stay. You are not interesting to Mei.
Two strong guys walked around Rick and, taking Eul, who was sitting on the floor, rudely dragged him to the exit from the house. He groaned loudly, tried to get up, but his legs parted to the sides, wiping dust and dirt from the plank floor.
One of the men sitting on the floor - thin, with a neatly cropped mustache, in what was once white, but now dirty gray trousers and the same dirty shirt, looking at Dick, said:
	 - I have nothing to do with it! I'm a guest.
	 - Relax, Zhong. They are from the police. You will be returned back to the psychiatric hospital, - the woman said these words in a calm, measured voice, as if it were about trifles.
She looked at Dick at the face-skinny, with big, bright eyes of a decent girl, her green blouse unbuttoned and exposed her right flat chest - small, with a large mole at the nipple. The black skirt lifted up, revealing sharp, thick knees.
	 - You're the captain,- she said.- These two are from your precinct.
	 - Are they policemen?- Zhong seemed unable to believe his happiness, as if he had met his beloved relatives.- Are they really cops?
	 - Shut your mouth,- muttered Dick.
	 - That's for sure, - the woman smiled a kind, sincere smile. - Hello, Dick School. How is your wife's health? Is your son still alive?
Dick hit her in the face with the barrel of a pistol - the woman's head jerked back, from her ripped right cheek, dark blood appeared.
	 - Carrion!
	 - Caps! - the guy who was sitting next to the bony Zhong - bald strong man, in a light T-shirt with the words "Good morning", and in black trousers, literally squealed with joy, in his wide smile, Rick saw uneven, bad teeth. Caps! Take me to Dr. Mubai, I want to see Dr. Mubai, where are my pills?- And he whinnied hysterically.
	 - Dr. Mubai fell asleep, Sluk, - the woman smiled at Sluk with a warm, motherly smile.
	 - Yes, he fell asleep. Headless.
Rick heard a loud puffing, standing next to him, silent Guy.
	 - Why did you do that?- Asked the woman, Dick.
Rick saw her looking at Dick with an expression of some kind of inappropriate warmth on her face, her large, bright eyes, as if telling him, "I made you dinner, dear, I was a good girl all day."
	 - You will not understand.
Shorty Mei's boys in the room remained silent.
She turned her head towards Rick and, looking at him, simply said to him:
	 - You have to obey.
	 - What?
	 - You must obey.- Her face suddenly trembled, an expression of calmness broke, reflecting anguish, her eyes narrowed and she almost shouted out to Rick.- You must obey, otherwise you will become like Abrom Chloe! Like Abrom Chloe!
	 - What?- Rick barely heard his own voice, his throat tightened with a prickly spasm.
	 - Like Abrom Chloe! You will, you will, you will! ... - her voice broke into a screech, a shiny saliva flowed from her open mouth at the corners of her lips. - They will do what they want! You can't disobey!
	 - Bitch.- Dick pulled his hat down to the back of his head.- You're finished, bitch.
	 - And what will you do with me? - the young woman changed her face again, looked at Dick with a sweet, as if sincerely kind, look. - Will you arrest me? Oh, it's so annoying to go with you in the same car, and not be able to caress you, dear. I can do it.
Kines said:
	 - There were nine of them. These five, two corpses in the hallway, one in the bedroom. Someone is missing.
	 - Who else was with you?- Dick asked her.
	 - He's already far away, - the woman smiled broadly, her right cheek began to swell, blood flowed from her chin to her bare neck in a stream.- Caps missed zinger. - she laughed, twisting her mouth to the right side. - Zinger left.
	 - We need to take a look at the house,- said Kines.
	 - There’s only these in the house,” one of Mei’s guys, who was standing at the door, answered him — a lanky, dark-haired guy dressed in black trousers, sneakers and a white T-shirt, he shrugged his strong shoulders, they say, you need to look.
Kines, pistol in his right hand, turned gently and walked out into the corridor.
Rick, as if bewitched, looked at the face of the woman sitting on the floor, and asked her:
	 - Who should I obey?
	 - She’s nuts.- Dick spat on the floor.
	 - You know who, - she turned to Rick the look of her large, bright eyes. - Give them what they want. They will arrange everything in such a way that you will regret your stubbornness, idiot.
	 - What is she talking about?- Dick asked him.
	 - I do not know.
	 - Damn bitch, powders our brains. - Dick grinned, his black eyes, were like two pistol barrels, looking out from under low, bushy eyebrows. - You will regret it.
	 - You would regret your words, dear, if you got to know me better, - she again smiled at Dick with a warm smile. - Like Abrom Chloe. He shouted about his mom, cried and asked. He couldn't speak with his mouth shut, but I heard his every word! Oh, his eyes. They spoke more than words. He really didn't want to die. And he had warm, slippery intestines.- She laughed loudly, tears appeared in her eyes.- Mommy, my mommy, save me! Help me, my mommy! …
Dick silently raised his right hand with a pistol - thundered a shot. The head of the speaker jerked back, a dark, round dot appeared in the woman's forehead, and liquid debris and splashes flew out of the back of her head against the plank wall, she fell to the left, onto the guy sitting next to her, and flooding his shoulder and chest with her blood, buried her face into his stomach.
	 - You killed her!- The guy shouted, he seemed very frightened.- You killed!
Dick put the pistol down, spat, and turning to Mei's boyfriend, who was standing by the window, said:
	 - Party's over, guys. These I take.
	 - But the arrangement was different,- the one standing by the bedroom door told him calmly.- Mei won't like it.
	 - It is done. We haven't seen you. Get away from here. We'll deal with the rest.- Dick stood with his legs wide apart, smoke still billowing from the barrel of his pistol.
And then a shot rang out - in the room behind the wall, and immediately after it, the second.
Rick, as if waking up from a dream, rushed into the corridor. Guy is behind him.
The door leading to the second bedroom was wide open, it smelled of gunpowder smoke. The twilight of the room trembled from the light of the electric torch in Guy's hand. Rick immediately saw someone's legs sticking out from behind the door, near a large, antique wardrobe and, jumping over them, found himself in the room.
The man who was lying by the closet was dead, next to him was a shiny pistol, he was looking at the ceiling with his surviving eye, he had no second left - the bullet smashed the left side of his skull. The blood under his head glistened in a black pool.
Kines Grain was sitting on the floor under the open window, pistol in his right hand and his white shirt in the light of the lantern, quickly blushing with blood. The bullet entered his right chest, and he clamped his left hand over his wound, and the fingers of his hand seemed invisible against the background of his shirt soaked in blood.
	 - Kai!
Rick sat down next to him, grabbed Kines with his left hand and tried to lift him.
	 - Damn it, Kai,- Guy said.
	 - He was in the closet, - something gurgled in Kines's throat and he coughed, trembled.
Guy helped Rick get Kines to his feet.
	 - He's got to go to the hospital, Rick.
	 - Everything will be fine, Kai. - Rick said these words and they seemed stupid to him. - To the car! - He threw Kines's right hand over his neck, hugged him with his left.
They almost dragged Kines into the corridor - Rick led him on the right side, Guy on the left, he barely moved his legs, coughed.
The guy sitting on the floor, with his hands behind his back, tried to kick Rick in the leg, spat and said:
	 - The bloodhound is ready. Another funeral guaranteed …
Rick, without stopping, shot him in the stomach, the guy folded like a rag doll, pushed his face into the dirty floor, growled hysterically, jerking his legs.
Dick stepped forward to meet them, quickly asked:
	 - What about him?
	 - A bullet in the chest,- Guy replied.- He needs to go to the hospital.
	 - Rick, they already drove the cars, take Kai to the hospital. Guy, come back and help me clean up here. We need to call the guys from the department. Gentlemen, the show is over.
Standing at the exit, one of Mei's guys opened the door for them.
Five cars were parked in a long-abandoned courtyard, crushing the tall grass. Only at the second of the cars, the four-door Swallow-5, with a convertible canvas top, did the engine run, and the light of its headlights cut the surrounding darkness, illuminating the porch of the house, hitting Rick in the eyes. 
Near the car, three tough guys were pushing someone through the open rear door of the salon, and Rick heard a mocking, soothing voice saying:
	 - Eul, don’t whine, daddy is waiting for you.
Rick saw Laina's car, she was standing next to a large, black Drava, and they led Kines to her. In the cool night air, there was a tart scent of dope, a cricket chirped somewhere, dirty crushed stone underfoot rustled like a sea wave beating against the shore.
They walked past the car with the engine running and the guys next to it fell silent.
Rick opened the door, and he and Guy put Kines in the front passenger seat of the car.
	 - Rick …
	 - I know, Kai.
	 - He has little time.
Rick walked around the car, and a few seconds later was already sitting at the steering wheel. The engine of the car started, its headlights came on, highlighting Guy, who was standing next to him, the low roof of the rickety porch of the house, and three men frozen on it.
	 - By screws, - Kai said quietly, and Rick barely heard his voice, low and broken.
	 - By screws!
Laina's heavy car took off abruptly and kicked up thick dust into the night air. 
Rick turned the car in an open space in front of the house, crushing thick grass with its wheels, crushing wild bushes, and drove it along an abandoned road strewn with gravel.
Kai was silent. He pressed his left hand to his chest and looked through the windshield of the car.
The night flew in front of them in the bright light of the headlights, the cool wind rushed into the cabin through the open driver's window.
Rick drove as fast as the road conditions allowed - they were shaking on holes and bumps, thrown from side to side. A few minutes later, he took the car out onto the highway and, pressing the accelerator pedal to the limit, drove it towards the city. A new and powerful machine, rushed forward like a projectile.
Rick was in a hurry.
	 - Rick.
He glanced briefly towards Kines. In the reflections of the road, his face seemed gray.
	 - We’ll get to the hospital soon, Kai.
	 - Rick.
	 - What?
	 - I'm flying.
And that's all.
Kines Grain didn't say anything to Rick anymore.
Rick flew into the city streets at night, drove the car past the peacefully sleeping quarters, allowing himself to slow down on turns, but the car still flew onto the sidewalk at one of the intersections, near some summer cafe, swept aside chairs and tables, knocked down the advertising stand shield.
He turned left to pass the path to the hospital and drive through the old quarter, where narrow streets did not allow two cars to pass at once.
There, between the two-story brick houses standing close to each other, drying clothes hung on ropes stretched across the road, here the old cobblestone pavements were still preserved, the car bounced, creaked with springs, scared away stray dogs, rushed forward through the sleeping, unlit night, unlit by lanterns.
The hospital building, a three-story, still old building, with dark, large windows, appeared immediately behind the houses of the old quarter. The wrought-iron gates were closed, the guard's house greeted him with a black square window. Without slowing down, Rick sent the car forward, and under a powerful blow, the gates swung open with a crash and clang. The car, grinding with its springs, swerved towards the main entrance to the hospital, where a high, stone porch was white with a fresh whitewash, and there burned a lone, dim lamp under the canopy. Another second and under the screeching of the braking wheels the car froze in place.
Rick pressed the horn several times with his hand - a loud beep burst into the silence of the night, then opened the door and jumped out of the salon. Steam was pouring from under the hood of the car. Opening the door behind which Kines was sitting, he saw the one crumpled, unnaturally arching his neck to the right side, with his eyes closed.
	 - Kai! We arrived.
Holding Kines under his arms, Rick began to pull him out of the car - Kines did not react.
	 - Well, come on boy, now.
Rick had already pulled Kines out of the cabin when he heard the creak of the door being opened, the clatter of running feet behind him.
	 - Move away! Put it down!
Someone’s hands pushed Rick back, and a strong build, short-haired man in a white, starched robe, bent over Kines, who was lying on the asphalt.
Rick stood a step away from Kines, and looked at his calm, pale face.
The man touched Grain's neck, then looked at Rick and said:
	 - He died.
A minute later, Laina came up to them, dressed in a white robe, in the same white, strict cap, and light high-heeled shoes. She stopped next to the silent Rick, and the man, turning to her, said briefly:
	 - It's all here.
Laina asked Rick:
	 - What happened?
And he looked into her face, and did not find the right words.
	 - Rick.
	 - I did not make it in time.


                                                *******                                *******


The dim light of a weak electric lamp hanging under the dirty ceiling of the kitchen in Guy's apartment painted everything around in black and yellow tones.
The tablecloth covered with greasy stains, Guy removed, laid fresh newspapers in its place, put on the table two porcelain plates that he had left from the days of his family life - with cheerful, multi-colored flowers and golden rims, glasses and a couple of bottles of vodka. He cut the herring into thick slices, and at the end of the unpretentious table setting, put a pot of boiled potatoes on the table. A tin plate of sliced bread sat behind the pot.
In the corner by the window, standing on a humming primus stove, a green enamel teapot was boiling.
Rick threw a pack of cigarettes on the table, took an ashtray saucer from the windowsill, and sat down on a chair near the wall.
	 - Let's remember Kai, - said Guy, sitting down in a chair in front of the table.
He filled both glasses with vodka, put one in front of Rick, took the other for himself.
	 - He was a good guy and a great friend.
Rick remembered how he stood today near the coffin in which Kines Grain lay, remembered his parchment pale face, with an expression of calm, and said:
	 - He was.
They drank without clinking glasses.
Rick lit a cigarette.
Their entire section came to Grain's funeral, Yuka held back her tears until the last moment, and only when the coffin with the body was lowered into the grave, she burst into tears, hiding her face in her palms.
Grain's ex-wife did not attend the funeral.
For a minute or two, both were silent, then Rick said:
	 - I shouldn't have dragged you into this business.
	 - We have already discussed it.
	 - Discussed, - he leaned his back against the wall, looked at Guy, vodka pleasantly warmed his stomach and already diluted Rick's thoughts, with a slight hop. - In vain.
	 - Don't talk nonsense, Rick. - Guy was annoyed, winced from tobacco smoke. - It was not the dolls who killed him!
	 - Are you sure?
	 - You’re not drunk yet, Rick.
	 - Are you sure?
	 - A man killed him. The dolls have nothing to do with it!
	 - I know.
	 - Then I don’t understand what you’re trying to prove to me.
	 - Do you know what I mean.
	 - Rick, the words of the doll can be understood as you like, but Kai was shot by a man!
	 - The doll said, the pilot will fly. Do you understand, Guy? He will fly. And he flew away.
	 - Kai is dead, Rick.
Rick shook his head, spoke softly:
	 - These words of hers haunt me. I drove the car as best I could, I was in a hurry, I wanted to be in time. He died while still in the car, Guy. I'm flying. That's what he told me then. I'm flying.
	 - He died.
	 - He flew away, Guy. He flew away. You need to quit the game. I don’t want you “not to go blind” either.
	 - Damn, porcelain shit! I'm not fat. - Guy grinned, looking somewhere past Rick's face. - I'm a little overweight. And I won't go blind! Never! I will go to the Capital, to that doctor …
	 - Guy.
	 - ... Which your Laina advised me.
	 - Guy.
Guy fell silent, his gaze froze, he looked at his plate.
	 - If Kai "flew away", then you "will not go blind."
	 - What did the doll say about you?
	 - She said about Laine. "She will cry."
	 - "She will cry", - Guy repeated his words calmly, and looking Rick in the eyes, said. - And you suggest that I quit the game? You? Me?- Guy chuckled softly, his little nose reddened, his cheeks shiny with sweat.- No friend, I won't reverse. I’m not Musli Davs, I don’t shit in my pants. Forget it.
They drank again - Rick took slices of herring, oil flowed on the fingers of his right hand, somewhere beyond the kitchen wall from the neighbors, a gramophone sounded faintly.
	 - Radio, or something, turn it on.
	 - We have a funeral, - answered Guy and it was clear that he did not want to get up from his chair.
	 - We have neighbors, and our neighbors have ears.
Guy grunted, got up from his chair and, turning the round handle of the radio that hung on the wall above his head, sat down again. In the smoky kitchen, the clear voice of Pretty Mau sang, she sang "Cote d'Azur".
Guy sighed loudly.
	 - Do you remember the words of this crazy Doddy?
	 - Hmm. Dick shot her. What words? About Abrom?
	 - About Abrom, - confirmed Rick. - She said word for word what the doll told me. Word for word, Guy.- Rick imperceptibly switched to a whisper.
	 - She's nuts.
	 - She repeated the words of the doll, which she told me, and she did not just say them, she gave me advice! She knew! Knew what she was talking about, Guy! That's the problem.
Guy was silent for a minute, pondering something in his big, shaggy head, his dim look wandered over Rick's face - pensive, serious.
	 - What do you mean by that? What is she with dolls for one thing? This is funny, Rick. Nonsense.
	 - You listen. Her words, what she said to me, says only one thing - she knew what it was about. That is, she did not know about the notebook, but …
	 - Nonsense.
	 - I'm sure the dolls told her what and how she should have told me. I'm sure Guy.
	 - Doddy is a doll, and is she in the doll's hands? So what?
	 - Hmm. You still know how to grasp the very essence. Exactly.
Guy fell silent again.
He silently took a bottle of vodka with his right hand, silently and thoughtfully filled their glasses with it, drank it and ate a herring.
Silently.
Rick watched as Guy wiped his lips with his palm, fish oil and oil trickling down his chin.
	 - I've always thought about that, Rick.- And Guy began to bang the index finger of his right hand on the table, the newspaper in the place where his finger knocked out the inference, quickly soaked in oil and darkened.- Always. Is this how a person can do this to a person? All this blood, guts. What, just like that, they wanted to do it and they did it? Not. I do not believe. This Doddy is, of course, crazy.
	 - They hear them, Guy! They obey them.
Guy was silent for a short time, his index finger hovering in the air, the expression in his eyes, from judicious, turned into fanatical confidence.
	 - Here! This is the thought that I wanted to tell you now, Rick. They are their dolls. It turns out that way.
	 - It turns out like this. And you argued.
	 - Who? - Guy's eyes widened. - Yes, I'm just talking about this to you!
	 - What do we do?
	 - With what?
	 - At all.
	 - Hmm. - Guy thought again and said. - The notebook they need desperately.
	 - I won't give them the notebook.
	 - I know. And what difference does that make? And the agents? The Inquiry Department doesn't like to joke, they won't leave you that easy, Rick. Well, will you give this notebook to the dolls …
	 - It's out of the question.
	 - I’m so, I say, figuratively. So what? What do you tell the agents? Gentlemen, I no longer have a notebook, turn to the dolls, I gave it to them, - and Guy laughed hoarsely, his round belly covered with a white T-shirt, twitched sharply, his eyes were watering. - Excuse me, uncles, but all the questions now not to me.
Rick was amused, he laughed.
They drank again.
Guy was quickly drunk, his shiny cheeks flushed, and the hair on his head stuck out in greasy tufts in all directions.
It had long been dark behind the window, curtained by a dirty curtain, the open window, pushing back the edge of the curtain, opened a narrow, dark gap, and crumbs of stars burned in this gap. From time to time a faint gust of wind flew into the kitchen, and then the stench of tobacco smoke, mixed with the smell of herring, was diluted for short minutes with fresh, clean air.
Guy suddenly asked Rick:
	 - When are you going to make an offer to Laine?
	 - I think about it.
	 - Uh-huh. You think. Thinker.
	 - Such cases are not solved right away.
	 - And let me tell her myself? Right like this, I'll go into her office and tell her. - Guy smiled a satisfied, drunken smile, it was clear that the thought that had visited his head, about a visit to Laina's office, really pleased him. - Laina, I'll tell her, Rick is afraid to call you in marriage, he doesn't have the heart to tell you about it. And I think Musli Davs was a relative of him!
	 - Guy, damn it.
	 - What? How long will you fool a good woman's head?
	 - Not for long.
	 - When?
	 - I think.
	 - Did you buy the rings? The question is bluntly, yes or no?
	 - Okay. I myself have already decided …
	 - Yes or no, Rick?
	 - I decided to buy rings next week. I'll get a salary and buy it. Exactly.
Guy grinned, looking Rick in the eye, said:
	 - Musley Davs.
	 - We are not relatives.
	 - Let's see, Rick. We'll see.
	 - I’m what I’m thinking about. Today I saw Major Fomo at the headquarters, and his face was very joyful. Blooming erysipelas.
	 - And what did that asshole tell you?
	 - We didn't talk. He just walked down the corridor, past me, and smiled like this.- Rick stretched his lips into a smile, showing Guy how Major Fomo was smiling in the corridor.
	 - What, was he smiling like that?
	 - So he smiled.
	 - A disgusting thing.- Guy scratched his round chin with his right hand.- I don’t like it.
	 - Me too.
	 - And what do you think about it?
Rick shrugged his shoulders, answered vaguely:
	 - The story turned out loud. Our testimony is already in the commission, they will decide without us. They will interrogate and decide.
	 - Will they kick us?
	 - It's good if they just kick us out of the police.
	 - Well, you overdid it, friend. The whole city is on its ears! We are heroes!
	 - Many heroes have lost their heads.
	 - But it's done.
	 - Already done.
And Rick drank the vodka out of his glass in one gulp, wiped it off with his palm and stared with a drunken gaze motionless at the plate of appetizer.
"Filthy business."
There was a knock on the front door, loudly and forcefully.
Rick and Guy exchanged glances.
	 - Sit here.- Guy got to his feet and walked heavily into the dimly lit hallway. Rick watched from the kitchen as he pulled a heavy, long-barreled pistol from a holster hanging on a hanger, and opened the lock of the front door.
	 - That’s how it’s, huh?- Came the loud voice of Dick School, and Rick saw him tumble into the hallway - drunk, in black trousers and a white shirt, Dick’s black shoes were muddy, and a green hat was sitting on his head pulled down to the back of his head. - You meet guests with a pistol!
	 - Dick.
	 - Guy, - this is Doug Schopeller, who entered after the captain, who seemed crystal sober, pulls his thin hand to Guy's pistol.
	 - Doug, damn it!
	 - Give, I say, this thing here. Like this.
Rick walked out of the kitchen into the hallway, stood leaning against the doorframe, looked at Dick, who was poking his short index finger into Guy's chest with a serious look, and said:
	 - Here's to you, and to this ... Where is he?
	 - Who?
	 - Rick.
	 - He’s standing there,- Guy replied with a smile.
	 - And you, - Dick School's finger turned towards Rick. - Reprimand - both of you. You are pigs. We were not invited. Kai was our one of the lads, he was one of us…
Mirol Dar, Lau and Pei were already entering the hallway door.
Rick unstuck from the doorframe, stepped forward and held out his hand to Dick, said:
	 - I knew you were coming, Dick.
	 - Yes? Where?- Dick School looked surprised and confused.
And Rick answered him:
	 - Because you are one of our guys.
They barely fit all in Guy's kitchen. They remembered Kines Grain and Abrom Chloe, drank and even argued with each other afterwards. And in this hubbub of voices, Guy suddenly remembered about his eye drops and, taking them out of the cabinet, began to poke a glass pipette into a transparent vial. And Dick School, in his shirt unbuttoned and with a piece of herring stuck to his right elbow, exclaimed:
	 - Give me!
	 - What if you pierce my eye?
	 - Who? I?
	 - Better let Mirol drip.
	 - And this is not a target in the shooting range, this is an eye!
Rick went out onto the balcony, he was sick from the stench and stuffiness in the kitchen, he stood, peering into the starry sky and thought that maybe now, at this very minute, Kai is flying somewhere out there, in a swift emptiness, to find himself another - a better world.
Duk Shopeller appeared next to him.
Closing the door leading to the room behind him, Duk coughed and quietly asked him:
	 - Rick.
	 - What?
	 - I, of course, understand everything, the thing is, there is a lot of turbidity, and no one seems to mind letting everything go on the brakes. But tell me one thing.
	 - What to say?
	 - Where did the ears go?
Rick did not understand what Duk was asking him about, and asked:
	 - What ears?
	 - Baby Doddy's ears.


                                               *******                                  *******


                                                                 Chapter Seven.


                                                                 Peaceful coast.


Contrary to Rick's fears, neither he, nor Guy, nor even Dick, was kicked from the police. A commission created to investigate what happened that night in an abandoned farmhouse investigated for a week.
Major Fomo and Captain Temple arrived at Rick's station, having gathered Dick, Guy and Rick in the School's office, to Rick's surprise, they literally "concocted a case", namely, they clearly explained to all three participants in the night firefight who and what should speak at the commission. The major, as if he did not notice the thick smell of alcoholic fumes emanating from all three, quickly filled the small space of the office.
Major Fomo was businesslike and sympathetic.
He made it clear that the outcome of the case had already been decided and approved by the police leadership. On the table in front of them lay a sheet of white paper with text printed on it, from which it followed that the night skirmish was “a carefully planned operation, under the leadership of Mr. Colonel Dawn Zhogs. Below were the signatures of Colonel Zhogs himself, his deputy, as well as the seal of the district and city prosecutors, and their resolutions. Dick, Rick and Guy put their signatures next to their names.
It took two long hours to reconcile the testimony of all three.
No mention of Shorty May and his men from the case file, but four police officers from neighboring precincts were added.
	 - And one more thing,- Major Fomo said softly, his straight eyebrows raised slightly, and his gray eyes filled with an expression of concern.- Kines Grain was not there. He's a civilian, we don't need it.
"Don't need it".
Outside the window, a white bus passed through the clear, pre-dinner air.
Dick nodded silently.
Guy frowned, and had already opened his mouth to answer something to the major, when Rick said inexpressively:
	 - Kines Grain was with us, Major.
	 - Listen, Lieutenant. I have an order for your promotion in my desk, and very soon you will become a captain, and you will become a lieutenant and a major, respectively. The city is in full swing.- There hasn't been as much shit as it has been poured on us lately. This is a police case, the honor of our uniform is offended, and there is an authoritative opinion that civilians should not be involved in this story.
	 - Kines Grain was killed there. He was with us.
	 - You are stubborn, Rickslem Yark.
	 - Grain was with us,- Rick repeated, looking into the Major’s watery eyes.- And he was not a civilian. Kai was a military pilot with the rank of lieutenant.
	 - Do you insist?
	 - I insist.
For a while in the office, no one uttered a word, then Major Fomo asked Rick, with a condescending smile on his narrow lips:
	 - Is it so important?
	 - It is important.
	 - Well, then. Let it be your way, - he took from the table a sheet of paper with resolutions, in which the police had just signed, put it in a leather folder with a metal latch, and took out another sheet from the folder, said.- Sign here, gentlemen. In the interests of the common cause, we do not need controversial formalities.
"Controversial formalities".
On the sheet the Major put on the table, the short list of names read "Private Investigator Kines Grain, voluntary participation," and opposite him was his signature.
Seeing the look in Rick's eyes, Fomo shrugged and explained:
	 - A sample of his signature is in our archive.
The major and the captain left.
All three - Dick, Rick and Guy lit a cigarette, Dick dropped into his chair at the table, Guy sat down heavily on the chair opposite him, Rick sat down on the windowsill, he shook the ashes from the cigarette onto the floor.
	 - So, like this. - Dick tried not to look at anyone, twirling in the fingers of his left hand, a broken pencil, in his right hand, a cigarette was smoking. - They adhered to us.
They were silent.
	 - It could have ended worse,- said Dick again.- Much worse.
	 - It could,- Guy confirmed.
Rick was silent, and then Dick irritatedly threw the pencil on the table, looked him straight in the eyes, and asked:
	 - Again, not everything is so smooth? Is there something you want to tell me, Rick?
	 - I do not want.
	 - Then you both, get out of my office to hell! We have accumulated a lot of all sorts of shit, and this shit needs to be raked somehow.


                                                    *******                             *******


All week city newspapers were full of headlines - "Police revenge", "The city is safe", "Heroes in blue uniforms", "It's over", etc. 
Harbor Tribune and Express in unison praised the City Police, the Chief of Police and the District Attorney.
Morvi Soyuk from "Express", who, from the newspaper pages until recently, poured the city police with angry demands "to tear the fat lazy ass from the chair and go about his business", was now singing like a nightingale:
“We believed.
We believed when the first, innocent blood was shed on our streets.
We believed when darkness and fear enveloped the city quarters, when horror entered the avenues with the coming of darkness.
We believed when there was no more room for faith in our hearts.
When insane killers made their bloody feast, remaining elusive and unpunished.
But now, the hour of reckoning has struck for them!
No one, and never, can evade retaliation, endlessly, especially if the best of the best have taken up the investigation.
Their names are: Colonel Dawn Jogs, Major Fomo Cru and Major Fach Sheld. Under their vigilant leadership, all these long weeks, the investigation of wild and bloody crimes was going on.
The district attorney and his team of experts and investigators, around the clock carried out their difficult service, it is they, step by step, approaching the day of retribution for the inhuman fiends who attacked our quiet city.
It is also worth noting the restraint and composure of ordinary policemen, who that night were under a hail of bullets.
Dick School is the captain of the second police station, and his subordinates,
Rixlheim Yark is a lieutenant, and Guyvon Ool is a sub-lieutenant.
Muer Hubli - captain of the eleventh police station,
Joket Mnre is the captain of the fifth police station.
During the arrest of especially dangerous criminals, a private detective, Kines Grain, was killed, who provided the police with his all possible assistance ... "
"Possible assistance".
Rick slowly folded up a fresh issue of Express and looked around.
Guy was still gone.
There were not many people in the corridor of the second floor of the police department, all the guests had already entered the conference room, five police officers stood at the high, carved door, and three in civilian clothes were smoking at the next window. Two girls walked past Rick, dousing him with the scent of tart perfume.
He looked out the wide open window - the midday sun flooded with a bright light in the parking area in front of the entrance to the police department, sparkled on the polished roofs of cars parked there, the windless, viscous air heated up, from which the stuffiness in the corridor seemed unbearable.
Rick's blue police shirt is drenched in sweat, the rim of his cap is sticky to his forehead.
Rick put the newspaper on the windowsill.
	 - I'm here.
Rick turned back, looked at the approaching Guy, asked:
	 - Where have you gone?
	 - The stomach ached, - he grimaced. - As deliberately.
	 - Gentlemen!
They were quickly approached by a middle-aged man with a bald spot on his larger head, with protruding ears, in a light beige suit and white shoes.
	 - Please, everything is already in place. We begin.
Rick and Guy followed to the conference room.
They took seats in the third row, where the police were sitting and where there were still empty seats. The hall was full of people, many were talking about something among themselves. The first row of seats in the hall was occupied by high officials from the city and district police, prosecutors and several people dressed in civilian clothes.
In the second row, there were about three dozen reporters. Their cameras on steel tripods solemnly towered over the heads of those sitting.
On the stage, behind a lacquered wooden tribune with the insignia of the city police, there was a long table, at which, including Colonel Jogs and Major Fomo, Rick saw the full figure of the mayor of the city.
District Attorney Erm Salt was the first to speak. He went to the podium from the table, and when he appeared, all the voices in the hall died down.
	 - I'm glad we are all gathered here for such a momentous event, ladies and gentlemen.- The wide face of the district attorney put on a restrained smile. - All is well that ends well. All the circumstances of this case are still being investigated, details are being clarified, but now we can say that all the worst is over.
Applause was heard in the hall, someone behind Rick's back laughed happily.
The District Attorney spoke at length about the "complexity of this case," the "importance and significance of this case," and the "courage and resilience of the people who took part in the investigation."
"This case."
Rick broke down and smiled.
After him, the colonel spoke from the rostrum. He was also verbose and avoided specifics, praised the “subordinates,” and did not forget about himself, mentioning that during the entire investigation, he “did not sleep a wink.”
Rick yawned controlledly.
The reporters were more specific.
A lively, young woman, in a yellow, short sleeveless dress, and with a shiny headband in her hair, from which a tall, white feather protruded, stood up from the first row and asked:
	 - Newspaper "Express". Colonel, our readers want to know how the police managed to find the criminals. If possible, in more detail.
Colonel Zhogs smiled at her with a fatherly smile and said:
	 - While the investigation is underway, I cannot tell you about the details of this investigation, madam. I will say that the capture of the criminals was the fruit of the painstaking work of investigators and experts. In the end, we came to the conclusion that criminals can only be hiding in a few places that have become known to us. The abandoned house in the east of the suburb was only one clue, and it so happened that it turned out to be the only true one. A group of five policemen drove there at night. There were also groups that worked out other possible places where, in our opinion, the killers could hide. Our employees worked clearly and harmoniously, having determined on the spot the course of further actions, they went to storm the house. As a result of this assault, two criminals were detained, three of them were killed during the arrest. Agree that with the severity of their deed, they did not deserve pity. And nevertheless, we took two and they will soon find themselves before the court.
	 - "Herald of the Harbor". Colonel! ”Exclaimed a young guy in a blue tracksuit, who had risen from his seat.“ Tell us, please, about crazy Doddy! Who is she? What did she want to achieve with these killings? Why...
	 - Doddy, namely Dodds Mrike, including two other psychiatric patients, fled last spring,- the Colonel said.- I can say for sure that Doddy and her accomplices did not pursue any specific goal. These are pathological killers, the whole meaning of which is known only to themselves. They killed for fun. Well, as they say, "a mad dog will always find its end."
	 - Given the current legal provisions, two assassins will be able to escape the gallows, Colonel,- the reporter said.
Disgruntled voices were heard in the hall, the colonel made a stopping gesture with his hand, demanding silence, said:
	 - Madam, we are simple guardians of the law. What do you want from us? It is our duty to catch criminals and maintain order in society. All questions about the punishment of these murderers are beyond our competence.
	 - "Evening Dawn". How did a private person get into the group of detention, Mr. Colonel? - this was asked by a tall man in his forties, in black trousers and a white shirt.
	 - We found it possible to accept assistance in the investigation of the crime from Mr. Kines Grain. We must not forget that Grain was not an accidental onlooker, he was a legal entity, had a license as a private investigator, and in the past served in the military aviation with the rank of lieutenant.
	 - "Voice of the People". Colonel, how will the police officers who took part in the arrest of the murderer's gang be noted?
	 - Gentlemen, gentlemen,- the colonel laughed good-naturedly.- You are running ahead of the locomotive, gentlemen. I want to note that one of the policemen who stormed that house, the grandson of the hero of the Resistance - Sklim Yark, Rickslem Yark. Lieutenant Rickslem Yark.- The colonel gestured towards Rick, who was sitting in the third row chair.- Decent connection between generations. We are proud of our employees. These are decent and professional people in their field.
Almost everyone in the hall turned to look for the "grandson of the hero of the Resistance", and the noise of voices was heard.
Rick tried to pretend that what the colonel had said about him did not apply to him.
	 - Mister Colonel, - a representative-looking man, in a light gray suit, and the same light gray hat got up from his place. - “Capital tribune”. How do you assess the work of the capital's agents from the inquiry department? Thank you.
	 - Well, we are local, provincials, we dislike the guests of the capital, - the colonel answered with a laugh, while those sitting in the hall laughed and applauded him. - But not in this case. The agents of the metropolitan Department of Inquiry provided us invaluable assistance in the investigation of the murders, - the colonel pointedly raised the index finger of his right hand, on which a large ring with a stone flashed. - Invaluable help!
And that's all.
Then the mayor of the city spoke. He got out hard from the table, and as he walked to the podium.
Rick looked at the ridiculous figure of the mayor, wrapped in a white shirt and light brown trousers, which could not hide the huge saggy bottom of the mayor, nor his thighs, which rubbed against each other as he walked.
Rick yawned, he did not even begin to hide it, yawned with all his mouth.
The mayor spoke long and enthusiastically, his voice was high and shrill, and his round face, with drooping cheeks, portrayed irrepressible joy and admiration for the "valiant police" and "ordinary guys in caps."
“Ordinary guys”.
"In caps."
Rick could not help laughing, but then stopped short - Guy, who was sitting next to him, pushed Rick with his elbow under his ribs.
The mayor sprinkled with laudatory epithets, he gestured with small, fat hands, and Rick thought, how could it happen that the majority of voters voted for this man?
At the end of his fiery, screeching speech, the mayor said:
	 - The municipality of the city found it possible to allocate funds from the city budget for the purchase of three powerful cars, and transfer them to the city police, for two sections and management. We believe - all the townspeople are unanimous that our peace is reliably protected by the valiant police and ordinary guys who do not just wear their blue uniforms!
After the Mayor's speech, an official award ceremony took place.
The colonel again came to the podium, this time accompanied by Major Fomo. The major followed the colonel, holding several red boxes in his hands.
	 - For the shown courage and invaluable contribution to the maintenance of law and order, the orders "For Valor" are awarded …
Rick was the fourth to be called on stage - after Dick and the other two captains - from the eleventh and fifth precincts.
Handing him a red, velvet box, Colonel Zhogs handed him the order to promote Rick to the rank of police captain. To the red box was added a pair of narrow, blue-gold shoulder straps, tied together with a green ribbon.
After Rick, Guy was called on the stage.
Having become a police major, Dick literally glowed with joy.


                                             *******                                  *******

	 - Rick, let's get drunk?- Guy, who was sitting in the passenger seat, laughed loudly, he held in his big palms a box with a medal lying in it, he put the lieutenant's shoulder straps into the breast pocket of his uniform shirt, and they stuck out of him, sparkling in sunlight, gold embroidery. - Today! BUT?
Rick smiled.
He stared out the windshield of the car, his hands on the steering wheel.
They had just pulled out of the police station, where participants in a recent press conference were crowded in the hallway in front of the conference room.
	 - Are you happy?
	 - And you? - Guy was still smiling. - You got epaulettes!
	 - Shoulder straps.
Rick drove their police car down East Avenue, keeping to the front lane. The streets of the city, exhausted by the heat and the sun, languished in anticipation of rain, the wind seemed to fall asleep somewhere in the muddy, whitish skies, and all living things were suffocating now, from the haze and heat.
	 - They're a gang,- Rick said, simply.
Guy didn't answer.
	 - They're a gang. All of them are colonel, prosecutor, mayor of the city. They are all one.
	 - We deserve these shoulder straps, Rick.
	 - We deserve it.
	 - We have earned them long ago.
	 - Long.
	 - So you don't have to pose as a ballerina.
Rick laughed, looked towards Guy and asked:
	 - Why - a ballerina?
	 - Why - a ballerina?
	 - Well, they ... - Guy was effaced, confusion was displayed on his full face.- They are such.
	 - What are such?
	 - In skirts, damn you! You understand what I said.
Rick laughed, he shook his head, said to Guy:
	 - That would be every ballerina, give shoulder straps!
	 - It's not funny, Rick. We are risking our own skin, it is people like us who maintain order in the Firmness, so that everything does not drown in blood! And these shoulder straps are rightfully ours. Many did not live to receive them. It's funny to you.
	 - Lieutenant, do you have cigarettes? Mine are over.
	 - Mine too.
Rick put his foot lightly on the accelerator pedal to increase the speed of the car, and to make the oncoming air flow more blowing on him, put his left elbow in the open window. There were no obstacles on the road ahead - a green truck rattled far away, just before the intersection, a white two-door "Lagoon-7", moving parallel to their police car, in the second lane. The sweat-soaked shirt clung disgustingly to his chest.
	 - Rick, stop behind the intersection.
	 - What for?
	 - Let's drink soda and buy cigarettes. They sell excellent soda with cherry syrup.
	 - Dick will be displeased.
	 - Dick will not tear himself away from Mr. Colonel's backside for a long time. There are no more forces, everything is baked inside!
A green traffic light was on at the intersection. Rick drove to the Place de la Concorde, turned into the parking lot and stopped the car in front of the curb and turned off the engine.
	 - Come on.
They got out into the suffocating heat - Guy squinted, adjusting the belt of his trousers.
Rick pulled his uniform cap over his eyes - the sunlight was shrill.
Opposite the main entrance to the posh restaurant "Passia", which was located in a five-story building, plastered and painted in a bright red color, there was a modest white kiosk with a green sign under the peak of the flat roof - "gas-water".
There were not many people here, two people were standing at the stall, and rare passers-by, walking along the sidewalk along the facade of the red building, tried to keep in the shadows, closer to the wall. Somewhere muffled music was playing - a husky saxophone played a sad melody.
	 - I don’t even want to think about going back to the police station now. There is a real gas chamber, - Guy grumbled walking next to Rick. - Now, I don't even want to think about it!
	 - Don't think about it. We'll all be there.
They had already covered half the way from the car to the kiosk when a ringing, female voice behind them called out to the police:
	 - Officers!
Guy and Rick stopped. A tortured expression of concern appeared on Guy's face. The sparkling water was postponed.
A young girl, no more than twenty years old, of short stature, with straw hair on her head, braided in two liquid pigtails, in gray shoes and a simple, light pink dress with green polka dots, was in a hurry to them.
An ordinary girl.
In her right hand, the girl was holding a cheap, green handbag, which is thrown away at sales on weekends.
Rick watched her approach, and thought that you can meet such a girl in a store or on the street, as now, and, turning away, forget her at once.
Perhaps she works, somewhere in the machine bureau - banging her fingers on the keys of a typewriter - day after day, month after month, and in her life there will be nothing bright or remarkable, like in her purse or dress.
It seemed to him that the girl's husband would also be unremarkable and cheap - work in the afternoon, and drunken scandals before going to bed in the evening.
Perhaps he will beat her.
Rick felt sorry for her.
The girl smiled embarrassedly at the police, she slowed down, and, without approaching them, spoke with notes of guilt in her ringing voice:
	 - Excuse me, please, could you tell me where Fourteenth Street is?
"Fourteenth Street".
Rick was about to open his mouth, going to answer her - the girl approached at arm's length, and then the world around him burst.
Rick, as if thrown out of reality into another, impossible place, the girl's words rang in his ears with a piercing, prolonged screech - "fourteenth street, fourteenth ..."
It was as if they had doused him with icy water, a wave of wild horror squeezed his chest, caught his breath, and Rick's whole body went numb, abruptly, at once. For a moment, he jerked his right hand to draw his pistol from its holster, and the hand froze near the belt itself. It seemed to him - inexplicably, it seemed impossible, as if his fingers were curled up in front of the iron clasp of the holster, and this clasp is now sparkling and burning in the sun, with an even, yellow fire.
There was a doll in front of him.
The way it appeared - unexpectedly, out of nowhere, it was like the appearance of an actor on the stage, all of a sudden, the curtain was pulled back, and the one who stood behind him, waiting for the moment of his release, jumps out in front of the audience with a shout - "here I am!"
The girl in a cheap dress with a green handbag in her hand disappeared. She was, as a part of a mysterious cocoon that surrounded the doll from prying eyes, did not allow strangers to see her, the real one, and, approaching Rik, the doll let him and Guy inside her cocoon, appeared before them as she is.
Rick couldn't scream.
He stood motionless in front of the monster, looked into the depths of her lifeless eyes, and saw in them a faint, greenish glow, like two tiny, green fireflies hidden in endlessly deep, black tunnels.
Sunlight played on the doll's porcelain cheeks, and Rick thought that those cheeks were cold as ice and hard as stone.
The doll's eyebrows, painted with black paint, shone with varnish as well as her bright red lips, small, toy ones. The doll's black hat was pushed over the back of her head, revealing a round, porcelain forehead with a fake hairstyle painted on it.
Rick's head exploded in pain and the doll's deafening voice:
	 - Enough playing. Give it to us. You will be pleased. They will obey you. She will sleep with you for a long time. Long! Give it to us!
Rick was gasping for breath, he was ready to die now, because death would have saved him from her, standing in a half-step - real, terrible, impossible.
	 - We can do it differently. You will regret.
The echo of the girl's voice was stuck in Rick's mind, it echoed with a high chime, thin, crystal bells - "fourteenth street, fourteenth street …"
	 - Do you want to sleep with her? You will sleep with her. Give it to us, and you will sleep with her for a long time. You will be in charge, important. Give it to us, don't play. We are fire. We are looking. We are death.
Tears flowed from Rick's eyes, his body trembled with a small, nervous tremor, he wanted, desperately wanted to subdue his body again to himself, but he could not, as if he was unable to wake up from a wild, chilling nightmare.
	 - You will die. The fat man will die. She will sleep with another. We - arrange. Give it to us. Tell me, I agree. Tell me, I agree! Tell me. Tell me. You will be like Abrom Chloe. We arrange everything!
The doll's words were rolling in his mind, burning like coals.
	 - It's all over. We must give it back. Give it back! Give it back!
"Fourteenth Street".Rick thought that he would have fallen on the hot asphalt long ago, if not for the doll's eyes. He did not see Guy, but he knew for sure that he was now standing next to him, amazed by the presence of a doll, in a shirt soaked with sweat, and his hand froze on a leather holster, weak-willed, helpless.
	 - Three days. Three days. The heir will die. It will be ours!
The doll stepped back.
For a moment, the world around Rick twisted, the houses that stood across the road, the square and the area for cars floated in ridiculous strokes, and suddenly everything took the usual, familiar form for him. A sweet, fragile girl, in a pink dress, knocking on the asphalt with the heels of gray shoes, quickly walked away to a large, black car parked near a police car. Opening the back door, the girl disappeared from Rick's view - the car immediately moved out of its place, taxiing onto the roadway, and after a few seconds, disappeared behind the facade of the house.
Rick was shaking a little, sensitivity gradually returned to his body.
At that moment, when Rick turned his head to the right to look at Guy, who was standing next to him, he swayed and began to fall on the asphalt - Rick tried to catch him, grabbed his sweaty, limp hand.


                                              *******                                    *******


They rushed into their police station - Rick walked in first, Guy followed.
Somewhere around the corner of the corridor, someone muttered monotonously about something. Duk Schopeller walked towards them, past the "corral's" fence. He wore a cream-colored shirt, and matching trousers and fashionable shoes. In his right hand the expert carried a black leather folder, and in his left he held a white felt hat with large brim. 
	 - Congratulations, guys, - he said, going up to Rick and holding out his hand with the folder. - I already got a call. Captain Yark!
Rick didn't answer, he felt sick.
And then Duk saw Guy.
	 - What happened?
Guy, with a flushed face, in a blue shirt soaked with sweat, with burgundy blood stains on his chest, silently walked by, and retreated down the corridor towards the toilet.
Rick froze next to Duk.
	 - What happened?
	 - Guy fell in the street. His nose started bleeding,- said Rick.
	 - Sunstroke.- Duk nodded his head in understanding.- This will end badly. Tell him to go to the doctor, Rick. Until he had a stroke.
	 - I'll tell him.
Mirol came out of the "corral" to them, held out his hand to Rik:
	 - Congratulations, captain.
	 - Thank you. We're all right?
	 - A fight in the Globus restaurant, one robbery - they cleaned out a man on Seventh Street, and crushed him a little. The testimony has already been taken. Frou is filling out the protocol now. Where is Guy?
	 - He's coming now.- answered Rick.
	 - He's preening,- Duk sighed.- This will all end badly for him. I'll tell you what, Rick. Is Dick still in control?
	 - Still.
	 - Then sign you.
	 - Sign what?
Doug began to explain to Rick that "I need to sign" - Rick looked into his gray eyes and could not collect his thoughts, everything that was happening now seemed unreal to him.
	 - Come to my office, Rick.
Ignoring Mirol, they headed down the hallway towards Duk's office. In the "corral", sitting at his desk, his head bowed low, wrote something to Frou.
They ran into Guy in front of the toilet door. With a wet face, red, with swollen eyelids, Guy came out of the toilet to meet them, shaking the water from his palms. The light from the opposite window illuminated Guy's full figure.
	 - Guy.
	 - What?
	 - First, I congratulate you.
	 - Uh-huh.
	 - You look bad, Guy.- Duk was serious.- I'm serious, go see a doctor.
Guy stared at the expert in silence, a drop of water sparkling on his small nose, wet hair sticking to his forehead.
	 - This is no joke, Guy. You will die.
Guy pushed Duk with his stomach, clearing the way for himself, moved down the corridor, saying:
	 - Don't croak.


                                             *******                                   *******


As the mayor promised at the press conference, their station received a new police car.
They drove her to the site on the last working day of the week, and everyone poured out into the parking lot to gawk at the gift from the municipality.
The car was gorgeous.
A new, four-door "Lagoon-12", black, with a white roof, stood next to the porch of the site, sparkling with brand new varnish in the rays of the rising morning sun, long and wide, its smooth curves of the body surprised with its novelty, and the leather interior – luxury. Chromed headlights glittered, and the solid-disc wheels were painted white as were the front doors, with the Quiet Harbor police crest neatly painted. In such "Lagoon" only bankers or owners of large production facilities traveled around the city. Even the mayor, probably out of modesty, preferred to go to the "Fast-9", the year before last.
Guy competently kicked the right front wheel of the car, said:
	 - Disc wheels! These are not knitting needles.
Dick climbed into the driver's seat, examining the red leather dashboard, which featured a prominent, shiny visor over the speedometer and a separate radio control panel.
	 - Wow, hmm, - Dick straightened up in the seat and smiled broadly at Rick, who was standing next to the car.- He did not deceive us, this fat-cheeked devil.
	 - At first, you can't drive it too much, you can ruin the engine, - Mirol said this without any importance, as if it were not an expensive car, but a child's toy.
	 - It goes without saying.- Dick got out of the car, pulled up his black trousers, his black hat slid down the back of his head.- Of course. Rick, no racing. I am giving it to you and Guy, not so that you ruin it.
	 - She probably eats a lot,- Guy muttered.
He patted the convex, polished fender of the car, then thoughtfully reached into the breast pocket of his shirt for cigarettes.
	 - Powerful, baby. I think that no one will hide from this.
	 - Her engine is boosted, - confirmed Mirol. - In a straight line, her declared speed …
	 - So. Nobody comes to the car! - Dick looked very serious, the question of the fate of the car, extremely worried him. - Only Rick and Guy. Well, I, of course.
	 - Of course,- Frou grumbled, peering through the windshield into the interior of the car.
	 - She is listed on our site. And I'm responsible for her!- Dick frowned.
	 - You're going to headquarters,- Frou told him.- In two weeks, Rick will be the boss here.
	 - So what?
	 - Nothing.
	 - What now needs to be turned into trash? Frou, no need to poke around there, it's polishing!
Passers-by looked back at them, threw respectful glances.
Sergeant Shock Lau, who had been silent for a long time, standing next to Mirol, spat to the side, looked into the cabin of the "Lagoon", and said skeptically:
	 - It's impractical.
	 - What is it all of a sudden?
	 - Major, they will immediately tear the skin of the sofa! We don't carry ballerinas.
	 - We will cover the sofa with some kind of cover,- Dick found at once.- Something.
	 - They’ll blot out the whole car. The entire cabin will stink of vomit. That's absolutely certain, Major.
	 - So.- Dick made a new decision.- Not to carry the detainees on it!
	 - And what to transport the detainees in?- Frou asked him.
	 - On your nag.
	 - Major, so why do we need it at all? - Sergeant Pei slapped himself on the thighs. - We need a workhorse.
	 - Frou, take Rick's car. Everything.
	 - And on our nag, who will ride?
	 - On your nag ...- Dick saw a new sub-lieutenant, En Vychmuns, coming down the steps towards them.- Your nag has a new rider. Already.- he glanced at Rick, said.- Will you drop me home tonight? Let the neighbors die of envy. Now, together with Guy, go to the office, and bring them the documents … Duk! Do you have all the documents for the Office Ready?
Duk Schopeller stood on the porch, leaning against the wooden railing and with an indifferent gaze, smoking.
	 - I have everything ready. Rick forgot to sign again.
	 - Rick!
	 - I'll sign.
	 - So, okay, gentlemen, - Dick carefully closed the door of a brand new car, looked at the business. - Now everything is in its place. Fru, take Shock and Tresma, and interrogate all the neighbors in the Janket case, go around all the nooks and crannies.
	 - Dick, - Frue objected with restraint. - We interviewed everyone.
	 - I will not take your excuses to the management! Dig and dig these scoundrels for me or you will be left without a bonus. Zhanket's wife is a big shot in the mayor's office.
	 - We need to put our shotguns in the trunk,- said Guy.


                                               *******                                      *******

They drove away from the police station when the watch on Rick's wrist showed 10.32.
Guy silently looked through another tabloid newspaper, smoked and spat out the open window, his cap was lying on the couch of the salon.
Rick glanced at the newspaper in the hands of Guy - "Who are they - guests from the abyss," asked:
	 - Interesting?
	 - I'm looking for something about dolls.
	 - And How? Found?
	 - No, - Guy sighed deeply and loudly, began to fold the newspaper, rustled its pages. - There is everything, about witches, dead people, ghosts, but about dolls — silence!
	 - Because - witches, dead and ghosts - shit.
They drove along Resistance Avenue, the facades of the buildings of the city's business district stretched to the right, the trees of the park flashed to the left.
	 - Today is the third day, Rick.
	 - We will survive.
	 - You can say whatever you want, but today I will come to visit you.
	 - Laina is always glad to see you, Guy. She's on duty tonight, but she'll be home tonight. However, with the drink will have to be postponed.
	 - Well, that’s just that, it’s not a problem. Let's sit at the table, lock the door. I have two trunks with me. Let these dolls just try to come to us. This time I won't let them get close to us.
	 - I think that all this is nonsense. They can't do anything to us. If they could have killed us long ago. And where the notebook is, they know for sure. I am sure about that.
	 - All the same, this day must be lived through.
	 - Look more fun, Guy. We will survive.
	 - Did you get an award?- Guy suddenly changed the subject.
	 - Yesterday. You know.
	 - And?
	 - What- "and"?
	 - Laina's wedding ring.
	 - Guy.
	 - Stop fooling her head, Rick. You are not a boy.
	 - Exactly.
	 - I'll tell her myself today. Let's sit at the table, and I'll lay it out.
	 - Guy, this is something else.
	 - Musli Davs.
	 - I told you.
	 - Musli.
	 - Not today.
	 - In principle, he was not a bad guy.
	 - Who?
	 - Musli Davs. I remember this nice guy well. He was a smart and careful guy, but he had a little problem. He shit in his pants.
Rick laughed, said:
	 - Turn on the radio.
The sun was shining brightly, but because of the rising wind, there was no longer that hot stuffiness that tormented everyone in the last days.
Music sounded in the car - the Big Mal's orchestra was playing, the trumpets played the melody of the song “Don't be sad” in unison.
And Rick, unexpectedly for himself, decided.
	 - We’ll stop by the jewelry store on Twenty-fourth Street, and I’ll pick a ring.
	 - Man! And then I already began to seem to me. I was already beginning to suspect.
Rick chuckled.
	 - What are you beginning to suspect about?
	 - What are you with him, relatives, - added Guy.
	 - With whom?
	 - With the good, careful guy Musli Davs.
The jewelry store, located on the first floor of a brick, five-story, residential building, still built during the White Castes, was light and spacious, sunlight penetrated into the visitors' hall, through large, spotlessly clean showcases, visitors - an elderly couple, stood in front of a glass cabinet at the end of the hall and about something quietly, they talked.
Rick went to the glass counter, and he was immediately approached by a smiling, elderly salesman, looking at Rick with black eyes, through his large glasses in gold rim.
	 - Hello, do you want to see something?
The salesman spoke with the air of the closest relative who saw Rick after an unbearably long separation.
This was the first time Rick had seen him.
	 - Good day. I want to choose a ring for a lady.
	 - I understand you very much. Ladies love jewelry and gifts, Captain.
Rick didn't argue.
	 - How much do you want to make a gift for a lady? - the seller said these words, slightly changing his tone, from sincerely joyful to intimately cordial. - If you want to buy a ring for a gift, then here there are very beautiful and not very expensive rings.
	 - I need a wedding ring. With a stone.
	 - Uh-huh, - for a moment the seller's gaze became piercing, like that of an appraiser-huckster, and he said in the most sincere tone, pointing to the rings that lay in front of Rick, behind the glass of the counter. - Here, Mr. Captain, very beautiful and very inexpensive rings with stones. There is with turquoise, but this one with emerald.
	 - Not. I need an expensive ring.
	 - How expensive?
	 - This ring, how much does it cost?- Rick pointed to a gold ring with a transparent, sparkling stone, in a thin frame lying in an open box of red velvet.
	 - Oh, this is a very good choice. You have a taste for beautiful and expensive things. Mne, uh, uh …
	 - How many?
	 - One thousand eight hundred coins, - he immediately, as if recollecting himself, added. - We can make you not a big discount. A small but nice discount, Captain. And what is the size of the lady's ring?
Rick answered.
	 - We just have the size your lady needs. There are not many such rings with a diamond, I assure you. We will give you a discount …
	 - Not. Without discount. I take the ring. One thousand eight hundred coins.
Ten minutes later, he returned to the car - without a bonus equal to his two-year salary, and with a ring in a red box, which was already in the right pocket of his trousers.
Rick sat down in his seat in front of the steering wheel, a goofy smile on his face.
	 - Well?- Guy put the newspaper down on his lap and stared into Rick's face.
	 - I bought it.
	 - Show me!
Rick took a velvet box out of his pocket and handed it to Guy, who opened it, raised it to his eyes, in his thick fingers, the box seemed very small.
	 - Gorgeous, Rick! - He returned the box with the ring, back to Rick, delicately asked. - Was the prize enough?
	 - Enough. Still left for vodka and snacks.
	 - Excellent! That is, I wanted to say - a very expensive thing! And you were fooling me.
	 - What makes you think so?
	 - Money for the ring. You kept them to yourself.
	 - I thought.
Rick stopped the car in front of the front porch of their police station, turned off the engine.
Guy stretched out with a grunt and took a black leather folder from the couch. The new seat under him creaked in protest, and opening the door, said:
	 - I'll go and give it to Dick, it's time for me to get used to the lieutenant's shoulder straps.
Rick got out of the car, slammed the door and lit a cigarette - he did not want to return to the stuffy area.
	 - What are you doing?- Guy was already standing on the steps of the porch, with a folder in his left hand.
	 - I'll smoke.
Guy is gone.
Looking at the roadway, at the smoky and noisy cars passing by, Rick leaned on the smooth and warm roof of the police car, smoked, putting his face in the fresh, not strong wind.
He imagined how he would give Laina a wedding ring, how he would tell her ... What and how would he tell her?
"- Honey, I love you very much, and I want to ..."
No, it's not that. It sounds like a stupid movie.
"Laina, I should have told you a long time ago."
Rick saw a brown, four-door "Barabalon-100" braking in front of the parking lot, two steps away from him, a brand new one, sparkling, in its open, front passenger window, smiling at Rik a familiar, brown-tanned face.
	 - Good afternoon, captain!- “Tanned” easily got out of his car and, without closing the door, stepped to Rick, stretching out his right hand to him in greeting.- What a meeting. And I look, a familiar face. Do you have a new car? Great model.
Rick shook the Major's outstretched hand, said with restraint:
	 - Good afternoon, Major.
	 - And I, you know, pick up the tails - a paper routine. They love to breed bureaucracy with us, - the major of the Department of Inquiry looked into Rik's face with a good-natured, simple smile. - I congratulate you on your promotion. You deserve it.
	 - Thank you.
	 - You did your job brilliantly. Brilliantly. Down with sentiment and drooling. It was possible not to arrest anyone, but to shoot the scoundrels, in the same place. The public would be on your side, captain.
Rick said nothing.
There was nothing to say to him.
	 - Today is good weather, - the major pulled his gray, brand new hat on his well-groomed back of the head. - There is no such disgusting heat. Hmm.
	 - Forecasters promised rain.
	 - Forecasters forever, they promise something, they get paid for it.
Rick smiled.
Easy conversation.
A chance meeting.
The major said:
	 - Captain, I have a good proposal for you. Come to us. With your track record, you will definitely be accepted. The Department of Inquiry is in dire need of experienced and smart guys.
	 - Not. Thank you, Major. I have already grown to my site. A quarter of a century is a term.
	 - "Term" is not a good word, captain, - and "Tanned" laughed again, almost to tears, sincerely.
Rick thought the major would now pat him on the shoulder in a friendly way.
Rick's cigarette went out, he held it in his hand as he holds a pencil in his office. He looked at the major and thought that if he turned the lapel of his gray, new jacket, he would hardly find there a sewn-on tag from the laundry or dry cleaning.
"Tanned" extended his hand to him, and Rick shook it:
	 - Well, well, captain. Nice to see you. I am glad that this business is over, and that I can return home again, to my wife and children. Do you have children?
	 - I haven't.
	 - Well, this is fixable. Nothing binds us to this life like family. However, this is none of my business, I will not advise you, so as not to run up.
They laughed together, friendly.
	 - Good luck, captain. You did great. If in old age, you begin to write memoirs, then your readers will be delighted with them.
	 - If I live to be old.
	 - In the meantime, it's never too late to start keeping a diary. I have an acquaintance who writes in a large notebook the history of his days. Don't be shy, captain, you probably also have such a notebook?- And the major looked kindly at Rick with a squint of his gray eyes.
Rick chuckled and replied:
	 - I have enough scribble at work.
	 - Yes, damn paperwork. Well, I won't detain you, captain, all the best to you.
	 - All the best.
The major easily climbed into his passenger seat, and already, without looking in the direction of Rick, closed the door, the brown "Barabalon", abruptly moved from the place, taxied into the second row, and after a few seconds, disappeared around the bend.
"There is such a notebook."
Rick went to the urn standing by the light pole, threw the cigarette butt into it and, running up the steps of the porch, entered the police station.
A scandal raged there.
Standing at his desk, almost next to the door leading to the captain's office, Frou Ool shouted angrily. He shouted at Guy, motionless in front of him, and Mirol helplessly hesitated beside them, and looked back towards the corridor, from where Sergeants Lau and Pei silently watched what was happening.
Duk Schopeller was standing almost in the very passage through the wooden fence that divided the corridor and the "corral" in two, and Rick had to push him aside to get through.
	 - Guys!- Duk spoke excitedly.- Frou, what dog bit you?
Frou paid no attention to him.
	 - What's going on here?- Asked Rick.
	 - What? I dont know. Here they grappled.
	 - Because of which?
	 - I don’t know, Rick. I came, they are already arguing, - and, lowering his voice almost to a whisper, Duk said to Rick, coming close to him, and dousing him with amber from fumes and tart cologne. - Guy told Frou that he married money. Scandal...
	 - You look at yourself! Useless piece of shit.- Frou almost shouted, looking into the face of what seemed to be confused Guy, he defiantly pushed forward his wide chest tightly covered with a blue shirt, his hands clenched into fists.- - Who needs you? Who do you look like? Downed drunk. Living like a vagabond overgrown with shit. We accept you into our home only because you are our relative. What about gifts? Your cheap gifts for children? I throw them out at night so that no one sees, so as not to upset my brother. Your Salina was tormented with you, but then you still did not sink, as now!
	 - Shut up, Frou.- Guy said those words in a low, hoarse voice.- Shut up.
	 - But the fact that? Who else will tell you this? They? - Frou waved his right hand somewhere to the side. - I'll tell you – straight. You will go to my house with your always drunken mug, you dishonor my children, - and Frou, raising his voice and twisting his face with a grimace of anguish, spoke, pretending to be someone.- Again Uncle Guy has come, he stinks again! Uncle Guy!
	 - Shut up, I told you!
	 - Look at him! Lieutenant, got a medal. So what? So what if you're a scarecrow for everyone? And do not go to my house any more, I will not let you on the threshold!
	 - So, like this?
	 - You are nobody!
	 - So, like this? - Guy backed away, turned away from Frou and, as if not seeing anyone in front of him, pushing Rick and Doug who stood in his way, left the "paddock" to the exit from the station.
Frou flushed with his puffy face and for some reason began to sort through the sheets of paper on his desk.
	 - Rick. - Duk tried to stop Rick, but he pushed him away and stepped forward towards Frou.
	 - Come on, Rick, protect your friend!- Frou left the papers on his desk alone, and stared at Rick who approached him.
	 - So you have a prosperous life, Fru? Wealth and prosperity?- Rick spoke in a calm, even voice, looking the junior lieutenant in the eyes.
	 - Rick, at least you, stop!- Duk Shopeller tried to intervene.
Mirrol was silent, frowning, standing next to Rick.
Rick said:
	 - We were still snotty boys then, Frou, but I remember this story well, when Guy dragged you across the city at night to the hospital, you - with a shitty ass and everything in vomit, because little Frou was dying. It was he who knocked down the doorsteps of your neighbors so that they would not go to the police when they left you the keys to the house so that little Fru would water the flowers, and you robbed them. Your older brother was wiping your ass off because your mother left you, and your father disappeared, no one knows where.
	 - It was a long time ago ... - muttered Frou, he still tried to look Rick in the eye.
	 - It was he who was cut by your friends whom you robbed. They should have cut you. It was he who walked, was busy about you, so that you would be admitted to the police school, otherwise, your feet would not be here. And they listened to him, because even then, Guy earned respect and his shoulder straps with blood. And if not for Guy, you would have rotted, somewhere in a prison for juvenile delinquents, and not wearing this blue uniform. And you don't like to repay debts.
Rick fell silent.
He turned away from Frou and moved out of the "corral", but at the very exit from it, he suddenly stopped and, looking back at Frou, said:
	 - Yes, you married money.
Guy was smoking, standing on the porch, leaning his elbows on the wooden railing, looking somewhere at the roadway, from under the cap pulled down low, almost to his very eyes.
A black folder, pressed by his full hand, stuck out at his elbow.
Rick stood next to him, took out a pack of cigarettes, slowly lit one from a gasoline lighter and, releasing a tight stream of tobacco smoke, said:
	 - It will rain.
	 - Uh-huh.
	 - Soon lunch. Let's go, buy something, eat something.
	 - Go.
They walked down the porch and got into their new police car, Rick started the engine.
	 - You’ll give it to Dick yourself,- Guy threw the leather folder on Rik’s lap, turned away, looked out the side window.
Rick pulled the car out onto the road and they drove down the front lane, lined up behind an old, green bus that was lurching to the right due to a poorly inflated rear wheel.
The sun was still shining in the sky, bright, summer, but dark blue, thick clouds were already setting from the South, and there was moisture and coolness.
	 - Guy.
	 - Leave it.
	 - He always had a quarrelsome character. You know.
	 - I know.
	 - He will apologize.
	 - He will apologize.
They were silent for a while, then Guy turned towards Rick and said:
	 - He said everything right.
	 - He said nonsense. By evening he will be sorry.
	 - I dreamed about my Salina,- Guy said unexpectedly.- Today.
Rick said nothing.
	 - It was a wonderful dream, Rick. She hasn't changed at all. It was good for us. There. I regretted waking up.
	 - Hmm.
	 - The most beautiful dream in all these damn years. I took her hand and we walked across the field, there was a lot of light and joy. I would never go back if I could.
Rick silently looked at the road, he had nothing to say.
	 - Rick. To hell with grub! - Guy suddenly came to life, his eyes sparkled with excitement. - Let's go now to Laina in the hospital! BUT? We have time. Go! Give her the ring.
And Rick, unexpectedly for himself, agreed, said with a smile:
	 - Go.
At the crossroads, he turned right, west of the city, towards the city hospital. He looked at the watch on his hand - they will have time, there is time. And they rushed past the chipped, brick facades of old houses, and past the growing poplars from the flower beds, fluffy, white with fluff. A few minutes later, Rick pulled up at the wrought-iron gates leading to the hospital grounds, and pressing his hand on the horn, alarmed the elderly guard, who was peacefully dozing on a bench near a small, service house.
Seeing a police car, the guard, with ashy gray hair sticking out from under his uniform cap, got to his feet and opened the gate.
Rick drove the car forward towards the main entrance of the hospital building.
The sun, as if saying goodbye to a thunderstorm, shone dazzlingly in the windows, brightly illuminated the figures of people walking along the asphalt paths or sitting on benches, its rays glittered on the iron handrails of the high porch, with white, whitewashed steps.
Rick stopped the car and turned off the engine.
	 - I’m not for long,- he said, his heart pounding in his chest like a hammer.
	 - Come on, bolder, Cautious Musli.
Rick hesitated.
Looking at Guy squinting in the sunlight, he said:
	 - You asked me what I would say to the aliens if they offered me to fly with them. Without Laina, I don't need anything. And she has work, patients are endless. And I also have a friend, a great guy, albeit a little plump in the sides. And I am glad that I have such a friend. I would definitely tell them no, because together with me, they would have to take this whole world. I have nowhere to go from here, Guy. My Peaceful Shore is here.
He got out of the car and briskly ran up the steps to the high, open door — a wooden door darkened with old varnish, with curly bronze handles. In the narrow lobby, at a bulky table with wooden shelves for registration cards, Rick was called by an elderly nurse, in a white coat and the same white cap, hooked to the side, with a shiny hairpin. The nurse's plump, simple face was covered in large freckles.
	 - Is there anything I can help you with, officer?
	 - I’m seeing Dr. Laina Dots on business.
	 - ABOUT! And she was just here, - the nurse turned her head to the right, peering into the windows of the partition, behind which the walls of the corridor were white. - Just now. Look straight down the hallway by the emergency room.
	 - Thanks.- Rick walked through the open doors in the partition, turned right, almost colliding with a pale man on crutches, in motley, crumpled pajamas.
Rick walked along the corridor with a confident, cheerful gait, on the go, taking out a red, velvet box from the pocket of his uniform trousers, he smiled, unable to suppress this smile. It smelled like it smells, probably in all hospitals without exception - an unusual, tart smell of medicines. Through the large windows, with long, green curtains parted to the sides, the sun shone brightly on the worn, in places cracked parquet, its brown varnish glittered with islands, the freshly whitewashed walls shone. From somewhere came the ringing of flasks.
Rick walked through the white, wooden doors, over which there was a blue sign that read “Emergency Room,” and almost immediately he saw Laina.
She stood at the end of the corridor, opposite the window, and laughed. Next to her, with his hands in the pockets of his white coat, stood a tall, young doctor, his swarthy face turned to her, black, short hair sticking out from under the white cap.
Laina's ringing, light laugh, poured out along the corridor with a multitude of silver bells, light, easy, happy.
They talked about something.
Rick slowed down.
They both wore white robes that shone in the sun.
And Rick saw her "spring light".
As then, in winter, when they walked along Seventh Street, towards the cinema, and it seemed to him that there was no winter, there was no grayness around and piercing the body, icy cold. It seemed to him that his whole previous life was just a ghostly misunderstanding, and that now for the first time in his life he began to truly live. On that day, it seemed to him that the frost was unable to break through to him, through the "spring light" of Laina. Her "spring light", which was visible only to him, and which she gave Rick with her warmth and love.
Rick stopped.
He looked at her, at the sunlit face, and saw the "spring light" of Laina. It seemed that the entire corridor was filled with this light. Affectionate highlights played on her cheeks, pink, mother-of-pearl rays of spring got entangled in her hairstyle, flickered, sparkled with straw tints in the hair falling from under the white cap, and her eyes exuded an irrepressible new force of joy - sincere, reflected on her sensual lips.
Spring light illuminated everything around Laina, it was her light, the light of her joy and love.
And that man in a white robe, standing next to her, took her light for granted, perhaps not seeing it at all.
Rick backed away, still smiling, then turned and quickened his pace, headed for the exit.
The nurse sitting in the lobby looked at Rick in surprise as he passed her and asked:
	 - So fast? Have you solved your question, officer?
	 - I have no questions left,- said Rick.
He was still smiling when he stepped out onto the porch of the hospital, and it seemed to him that his lungs were out of breath. Tucking the velvet box back into his pants pocket, Rick went back to the police car, got behind the steering wheel.
	 - Already?- Guy was surprised.
Rick started the engine, did not answer, the ghost of his beloved, "spring light" Laina still lived in front of his eyes, and her laughter still stirred his heart.
The car started to move, turned towards the gate.
	 - Did you talk to her?
	 - No,- Rick said.- She’s busy.
	 - So you would have waited for her!
	 - I no longer have time to wait.
They drove onto Eighteenth Street, and found themselves in a dense stream of cars, horns sounded, the noise of engines filled the air, which had suddenly become stuffy.
Rick felt a cool chill. As if Laina's “spring light”, the warm, caressing rays that remained somewhere behind him, could no longer warm him, and the world around him moved close to him like a cold, viscous jelly.
Guy was silent.
He occasionally glanced thoughtfully in the direction of Rick and did not ask about anything.
Someone's voice on the radio, sang the words of the song:
       Your lips, silence
       the coldness of your eyes
       they told me everything …
Before Rick's eyes, there was a blurred veil, and he slowed down the speed of the car, and now it trudged near the curb, behind a hulking, smelly truck.
	 - Shall we pick some pies?- Guy asked him.
	 - Let's go.
The voice on the radio sang:
       I will live like this
       without your smile,
       without hope to see the sunset with you.
The call signal sounded sharply on the radio, the red light came on, and Guy reached for the dashboard, flipped a switch, said:
	 - I'm listening to.
	 - Guy! - Dick's voice was clear. - In the port warehouses again some kind of mess. Only that they called from there. Some moron opened fire. Do you hear me?
	 - We hear.
	 - Go there and figure it out. The guard called. Fourth passage. Seventh terminal.
	 - Drive the fourth private road, don't let the bastards get away. And don't ruin the car.
	 - OK OK. Understood you. Let's go. - Guy turned off the radio, and grumbled, looking at Rick. - So we had lunch, damn them.
	 - Turn on the siren.
At the next intersection, Rick turned the car around, and with a long siren howl, they rushed north, along the Sailors Boulevard, towards the bypass road to the city port.
A few minutes later, they drove through the Green Quarter, and rushed towards the river, to where the port cranes froze against the background of a blackened from thunderclouds, low sky, where flashes of blinding lightning and approaching rain flickered, clouded the horizon with a gray, colorless curtain.
	 - Lousy weather, Rick. Again, some idiot was impatient to shoot. I hate these days.
	 - Exactly.
The road made a bend, went to the left, where it connected the northern part of the city with Route 19, on the left stretched, overgrown with weeds, fields, on the right flashed trees of a coniferous forest - dense, dark.
Through the melancholy howl of sirens, thunder rumbled, rare water splashes danced on the windshield of the car - it was starting to rain.
Guy, groaning, took out a heavy pistol with a long barrel from a holster hanging on his trousers belt, began to turn the "drum", looked at the cartridges.
Rick peered at the road in front of him, there, behind the "turn" sign, there would be an exit to the right, onto a private road leading to the city port, and there would also be a railway, unguarded crossing.
When there was very little left before the turn, Guy suddenly asked Rick:
	 - I understood you correctly - will the party be held at my place today?
	 - Yes.
	 - Clear.
The red light on the dashboard came on again, Guy reached out, took the microphone and turned on the radio:
	 - The fifth is listening.
	 - Guy. - it was Dick School again. - The port is canceled. Do you hear me? Everything is canceled. Wait near the beginning of the road, at the barrier at the beginning of the road, Frou and the guys are already coming to you. Four crews from the city administration are on their way.
	 - Why canceled?
	 - The guard called again. His partner is killed, they are firing from machine guns - a real fucking war. Don't poke your nose and wait at the entrance to the private road.
	 - Shit. Got it.
Guy hung up the microphone and looked at Rick.
	 - I have heard.
	 - And what do you think?
	 - We will wait.
They passed the turn-off road sign and almost immediately turned right onto a new, private road strewn with white, rain-darkened rubble. Rick stopped the car a hundred paces from the barrier, where a tall guard booth protruded, but he did not turn off the engine. A heavy barn lock hung on the door of the guard's booth. The siren went off, and the music from the radio began to sound louder.
	 - They’ll leave,- Guy said.
	 - You heard.
	 - They will leave. Along the old road, they will leave. They won't even look here.
	 - Guy, Dick explained everything. We are waiting.
	 - We must drive to the old fire station, and there cut off the old road. You know it's stupid to stand here.
Rick, said nothing.
He looked through the windshield of a car into the rain. The sky was completely covered with dark blue clouds, the water poured onto the firmness, a solid wall, lightning flashed above - bright, white, and then the peals of thunder hit him on the eardrums.
The thunderstorm has come.
So that's it, right, Rick? So that's it?
Rick turned and looked into Guy's face.
Lightning flashed again, and in its light, Guy's face seemed pale to Rick, his bulging eyes glittered.
For a while, they stared at each other in silence, like two conspirators deciding what to do.
	 - This is our party, Rick. You don't want to get out of our party, do you?
Rick chuckled, hesitated a little, and said to him:
	 - Let's touch their udders.
	 - Let's show the bastards who is the law!
The car roared with its new engine, jerked forward, throwing dirt and rubble from under the wheels. She skidded and, pressing the accelerator pedal to the floor and looking at the rapidly approaching white and red barrier, Rick heard Guy laughing loudly.
	 - Drive, Rick! - he shouted and laughed hoarsely. - Drive, drive!
Quickly picking up speed, the police car crashed with its convex hood into the crossbar of the barrier, smashed it to pieces, its windshield cracked from the impact. They rushed along the rubble humming under the wheels, cutting through the thick curtain of rain, to where the strip of forest was drowning in the bad weather, and where the old fire tower, still invisible, still distant, sour under the downpour.
The siren was again poignant, frightening, and Sonny Anle's sonorous voice sang in the radio, overlapping the rhythmic sound of guitars:
       Don't go far
       be by my side
       I'm angry for fun
       it is only now.
       From under long eyelashes,
       I follow my beloved gaze,
       so that it is not in it,
       irrecoverable losses.
       Irretrievable losses …
Dazzling, white-blue lightning tore apart the sky above their heads.
Guy gazed into the windshield of the car, looked with an unblinking gaze of shining eyes, the pistol in his right hand was raised to his chest. The car accelerated and rushed towards the thunderstorm, at the limit of its capabilities, the rubble under its steel belly rumbled with a continuous drumbeat.
Rick looked into the rain - into impenetrable, gray, solid, and it seemed to him that he had only to close his eyes, and he would again see the soft radiance of Laina's "spring light" eye.
	 - Nasty weather, Rick.
	 - What?
	 - I say it's lovely weather for our party, friend.
The bright reflections of lightning carved blue flashes of light on the pistol in Guy's hand.
Flashes of heavenly fire crashed into the rain, and illuminated everything that was in it. It seemed to Rik that he saw the turn of the road graying in the rain, and there, like a finger pointing to the sky, a lonely old fire tower sticking out. And in this madness of rain and light, three dark cars were guessed, which stood like sentries at the turn.
	 - Lovely weather. And this whole world, Guy. 
He thought and repeated:
	 - This whole world.



                                                                  THE END.

                                                                                                     October. 2019.
