“What is the heart of man?

It is a tragic organ that,
in seeking fulfillment,
destroys itself.”

-- Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

From his 1774 novel,
“The Sorrows of Young Werther”

1

THE tenth verse of the first book of Ecclesiastes embodies the futility of the dreams of man:

The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be;
and that which is done is that which shall be done: 
and there is no new thing under the sun.

And the dream of Jonathan Kinski always begins the same. His folly is that he dared to change the outcome.

Jonathan’s soul glides across a pristine snow blanket as “Le Veau d’or” from Charles Gounod’s Faust resonates across the wilds of Putnam/St. Mary’s Cemetery in Greenwich, Connecticut. As the tombstones give way to a marker and its occupant, renowned New York Metropolitan opera singer Ezio Pinza, Jonathan realizes the outcome to his dream lies in the distance—within the walls of St. Joseph’s Mausoleum. As he draws closer to a stained glass window pane, his soul passes through the glass, down a chair-lined corridor that leads to a mahogany and bronze-trimmed casket surrounded by red and pink oleander floral arrangements set against a burgundy tapestry. Jonathan gazes into the casket and sees the youthful, yet ossified, thirty-something body of his beloved Barbara; she rests on pristine, snow-white bedding—the white of the bedding overwhelms Jonathan’s sight.
Before Jonathan can reach to touch her cold, stone flesh one last time, he finds himself pulled across the pristine snows once more, towards a 1931 red-brick Georgian planted in the center of the eleven pastoral acres of the Kinski Family’s Greenwich estate. As he passes through a basement window pane, he sees his thirty-something self perched over an electron microscope inside his clinical research laboratory.
As Ezio Pinza’s tale of “The Golden Calf” echoes through the lab, Salamanders and Newts live a life of luxury inside two large terrariums. Four more terrariums support floral habitats of White, Pink, Yellow, and Blue Nerium Oleanders. Four computer monitors display 3D animations for the chemical structures of Extracellular Matrix, Alpha-Neoendorphin, and Beta-Endorphins. The final monitor displays the chemical structure of the Female Endocrine Glandular System—with a map of the pineal and pituitary, thyroid and parathyroid, thymus and adrenal glands, along with the pancreas and gonads.
His eyes pressed into the scope’s optics, Jonathan adjusts, and then speaks into a fiber optics headset. “Repair mechanisms continue to reconstruct affected areas with more bone tissues. However, the ossification rates indicate a deceleration. Regeneration remains incomplete and the necrotic tissues come fibrosis.”
As Jonathan pulls away the headset, he stretches and rubs his eyes; he concentrates on a salamander’s slither as it swims to break the surface waters.

In the upper floors of the Kinski Estate, meditative, harp and wind instrument-inspired new age music fills the master bath. A vanity mirror reflects the flickers of scented candles as a twenty-something Elizabeth Kinski sips from a burgundy wine glass; her firm, silky body soaks in marble bathtub contained waters.
Off the master bath, Ana Nicols, the Kinski’s young maid, exits a walk-in closet; she places a pair of designer shoes on the floor, then smoothes over a dress on the bed in the master bedroom.
“Ana,” Elizabeth calls out from the master bath, “I’m ready to get out.”

Draped in an open robe, Elizabeth sits at the vanity and rubs lotion on her skin. Ana unravels and brushes Elizabeth’s hair, while admiring the fresh aroma and the sight of the damp, supple breasts of her mistress.

In the lower depths of the Kinski Estate, The Fall of the Rebel Angels, a painting by Hieronymus Bosch, hangs beyond the floor-to-ceiling glass partition of a personal wine cellar. Jonathan, out of his lab wears, lounges in one of two chairs at a tasting table. He peruses his prize-winning collection of 1,395 wine bottles.

In the gourmet kitchen, raw, pink salmon drops onto an antique china plate. Fresh spinach pasta cascades from a pasta maker cranked by the almost forty-something hand of the Kinski’s quintessential gentleman’s gentleman, Charles, Jonathan’s personal valet, who also serves as the estate’s butler, chauffeur, and master chef.
Beyond, in the family room adjoined to the gourmet kitchen—sets an elegant dinner set for two on the dining table.
Down in the wine cellar, Jonathan extracts an Argentinean Burgundy Syrah from the wine rack and contemplates the bottle. He picks up the phone receiver on the tasting table.
“Sir?”
“What is this evening’s dinner, Charles?”
“Grilled Salmon, along with a spinach pasta side dish in a seafood sauce and a medley of fresh vegetables.”
Jonathan hangs up the phone. He inserts the Syrah into the rack. He selects a Pinot Noir, inspects the bottle, and then walks off. He stops, turns, and pulls an additional bottle of Pinot Noir.

In the family room off the gourmet kitchen, Jonathan pokes the flames of a fire’s glow that illuminates an 18th century Flemish painting, Mother and Child with Harlequin, hung over one of the home’s eleven masonry fireplaces.
The shelves and wall decor of the family room feature Jonathan’s prized collection of Edo Period Japanese Mechanical Clocks, known as “Wadokei,” a framed assortment of stringed, antique citterns, bandoras, pandoras, and orpharions, along with rare broadsheet music. A photograph of Ezio Pinza as Mephistopheles playing a cittern in the opera Faust, along with an 1828 oil portrait reproduction by Joseph Karl Stieler of a seventy-nine-year-old Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, are displayed on a wall above a Grand Piano.
As Jonathan racks the poker, he takes a seat at the piano. He pours the Pinot Noir from a crystal decanter into a burgundy wine glass. He swirls the bowl and partakes the aroma, gulps, swishes and swallows. He beings to play “Piano Sonata No. 4 in E-Flat, K 282. I. Adagio” by Wolfgang Amedeus Mozart.
Elizabeth enters. She absorbs the music, kicks off her designer shoes and echappes-on-point. “Those are the hands of concert pianist, Jonathan. Not a scientist.”
“Ah, to be in Munich on tour with an enraptured audience,” replies Jonathan as he receives a neck kiss from Elizabeth. “Charles Gounod was right: ‘Before Mozart, all ambitions turn to despair.’”
“Maybe I can tempt those hands to play in the devil’s workshop, Johnny,” says Elizabeth as Jonathan’s fingers glide across the keys.
In the gourmet kitchen, Charles removes a pink cake box from the refrigerator and removes its blue and yellow-decorated, three-layer cake. Ana carries a silver service tray with two aesthetically dressed Salmon dinners from the kitchen into the dining room.
And Jonathan’s Mozart ambitions end.

Later, in the dining room, Ana removes two crumbly cake plates, set next to a partially eaten Happy Anniversary cake on the dining room table. She walks into the gourmet kitchen. She stops, then steals a peek into the family room—and gazes at Elizabeth.
Elizabeth lounges on a couch as she caresses a wooden, antique cigar box restored as a personalized Memory Box.
She opens the lid to expose a French Memo Board with theatre ticket stubs and notes tucked behind, and commemorative scholastic pins stuck in the box’s pink ribbons woven against a pink paisley cloth. She removes a small stack of photographs.
Jonathan jabs the poker into the roaring fire.
Elizabeth approaches from behind and wraps her arms around him. “I can’t remember if I was ever this young, Jonathan.” She shows him a photograph. “Besides, my legs are out of touch with the rest of my body.”
“Maybe a jump into the fire will renew you,” tempts Jonathan as he inspects the poker’s red-hot tip.

Jonathan sprawls his nude body in front of the roaring fireplace.
A nude Elizabeth kneels over his waistline, arches her spine backwards, and bounces. As she thrusts Jonathan deep inside her body, his excitement entails a blank stare at the ceiling.
Then he stares at the empty burgundy wine glass and decanter on the piano. His gaze then turns to an ornate, white closed door in the rear of the gourmet kitchen. A sexy, vibrant woman with the free will to fuck him to his heart’s desire and all Jonathan can think of is what lies beyond that ornate, white door.
In her private maid quarters, behind that white door, Ana stands in front of a vanity mirror. She caresses her breasts cupped in a red lace bra, closes her eyes and dreams of her heart’s desire.

*   *

Elizabeth rises from the tub waters into her robe. Ana admires the soapy bath waters that cascade from Elizabeth’s breasts. As Ana gazes into Elizabeth’s eyes, she gently cups her hand under Elizabeth’s breast. Ana’s hand navigates towards her mistress’s abdomen.
Elizabeth’s burgundy wine glass falls from the edge of the tub and shatters across the marble floor. The wine splatters into a five-petalled floral pattern: The Rosa Canina—a dog rose.
Elizabeth emits a moan.

*   *

Ana stares at herself in the vanity mirror. Her own hand travels below her red-laced panties. Ana moans in ecstasy.

CLAD in maroon silk pajamas, Jonathan stares at his reflection in a dresser mirror in the master bedroom. He pours from a decanter. He gulps his burgundy wine glass.
Adorned in a pink ballet body suit, white tights, and pink satin Pointe shoes, Elizabeth kneels on a padded base, restrained in a back stockade. Shackles secure her wrists behind, to the main spine. Shackles on her ankles connected by chains run to the back corners of the base. A pink leather blindfold encases her eyes. She kneels in silence.
Jonathan saunters to the bedroom window. He gazes at his distorted reflection and runs his finger down the icy pane. He gazes downward, onto the symmetrical patterns of the geometric box topiary gardens bisected with cobblestone pathways at the rear of the estate. Two small, leaf bare rounded trees rise from each topiary box filled with Boxwood Plants.
Jonathan returns his gaze to Elizabeth. He places the full burgundy wine glass to his waistline and positions the glass to her lips. She tries to reach out with her tongue.
Jonathan quotes Yeats’s “A Drinking Song”:

“Wine comes in at the mouth
And love comes in at the eye;
That’s all we shall know for truth
Before we grow old and die.
I lift the glass to your mouth,
I look to you, and I sigh.”

Jonathan tips the glass. Elizabeth drinks, but does not swallow. He kisses her and sucks the wine from her mouth; then spits the wine back into the glass. He sets down the glass, cleans her mouth with a deep kiss, then kisses the toe box of her Pointe shoe. “You are in your kobako, tiny dancer.”
“You are the landscaper. I am the ornament,” says Elizabeth. “Shape me, Jonathan.”
Jonathan grasps a pink muzzle to encase Elizabeth’s cheeks and chin. She moans in ecstasy as he secures the buckle; her abdominals spasm; her chest heaves. Jonathan then locks a metal collar around her neck to the stockade’s spine. He steps back and, with his hands, mimes a box around her body.
He goes to the dresser and sets a Wadokei in motion. He presses the record buttons on three tripod-mounted digital cameras that capture Elizabeth from every angle. As the Wadokei ticks, Jonathan saunters out with the glass of backwashed burgundy wine.
Elizabeth heaves to the close and lock engagement of the master bedroom door.

Jonathan breaks the seal of the ornate, white door at the rear of the gourmet kitchen.
Ana lies swaddled under white satin sheets. He kneels on the bed; his nostrils consume Ana’s aroma. He swirls the bowl, inhales the wine’s aroma, then rips away the satin sheets. He straddles Ana and gulps the burgundy wine glass dry. Jonathan retains the wine in his mouth, then kisses Ana.
She gulps. A burgundy bead drips from the meeting of their lips. The white satin sheet absorbs the fermented juices.
Upstairs, snow fall collects on a windowsill of the master bedroom where Elizabeth kneels motionless, bound against the back stockade. The three digital cameras continue to record. The Wadokei ticks away the time.
In the maid’s quarters, Jonathan stares at Ana’s breasts bounce; however, according to his eyes, the flesh drapes the body of Barbara Kinski. Vivacious and vigorous, Barbara pants and groans over Jonathan.
As Ana thrusts Jonathan up into her body, his excitement entails a blank stare at the ceiling. Then he stares at the empty wine glass on dresser.
A sexy, vibrant woman with the free will to fuck him to his heart’s desire and all Jonathan can think of is the pangs of the past.

*   *

Charles offers his assistance to the hunched, arthritic Barbara Kinski, as he escorts her from the master bathroom into the bed of the master bedroom.
“Be sure to check on Ana. Whatever she needs, Jonathan can script it. She needs to be helping me, Charles.”
“Yes, Mrs. Kinksi.”
Charles dips and twists a hand towel into the basin on the nightstand and refreshes Barbara’s skin. A medical tray with a syringe sits nearby.
“And no matter how late Elizabeth returns, please wake me, Charles. I must hear all about her recital.”
“Yes, ma’am. Doctor Kinski will be up shortly to dispense your medications.”
Barbara touches his arm. Charles cradles and kisses her crippled hand.

And the creak of key crank wound on a music box fills the master bedroom.

*   *
*

The lid to a pink, wooden music jewelry box opens. A clockwork ballerina springs upright and pirouettes to the tinkling of an eighteen-note movement of “Over the Rainbow” from The Wizard of Oz.
The Oz Box.
One of the many curios displayed in Elizabeth’s Doll Room—a room of forgotten tools, paints, and doll parts. Curio cabinets and shelves display collections of antique porcelain dolls, vintage Irwin and Wells Brimtoy Clockwork Dolls, along with an assortment of Mechanical Ballerinas.
On the rear walls stands a custom made, room-high mahogany chest with four 24-inch wide by 12-inch high drawers stacked two-by-two at its center. Each drawer has its own polished brass handle and engraved I.D plates with (unintelligible) names of “dolls” on them.
A pair of white-gloved hands pushes a collapsible, mortuary body transport trolley towards the mahogany chest. A white-gloved finger caresses the chest’s grain and the I.D plate for “Ana Nicols.” A cloth-encased hand clutches the handle and pulls out the drawer—to reveal a self-contained box. The gloved hands place the box onto the transport trolley.
The lid opens on the 36-inch by 24-inch by 12-inch box to reveal the ossified body parts of Ana Nicols. Her head, torso, feet, upper legs, lower legs, hands, upper arms, and forearms each set it their own compartment. The white-gloved hand caresses the waistline of Ana’s torso and lifts the body part from its compartment.

The lid to the Ox Box closes and silences its clockwork ballerina.

Jonathan stirs; springs up in bed—in the master bedroom. He turns to Elizabeth, who stirs, snuggles in and continues to sleep. Jonathan picks up a multimedia remote control from the night stand and hits play: “Someone’s Always Singing,” a 1971 ballad by Shuggie Otis fills the room; the soulful resonance awakes Elizabeth. A smile breaks across her face as she lies quietly in bed and bunches the pillow under her head. Jonathan saunters by the unbolted shackles of the unoccupied back stockade. He pulls back the drapes and exits on to the balcony.
Outside, he enjoys a light snow on his face. He stares upward at a winter rainbow set against clear, blue skies.

THE morning rainbow’s spectrum dances on the walls of the Calligraphy Studio on the first floor of the Kinski Estate. The studio’s curio cabinets and shelves display antique books and boxes. Pens, brushes, inks, vellums, and parchments populate a large worktable. Framed watercolors, vintage maps, European and Eastern Asian calligraphy, along with frottage and stone rubbings pepper the walls.
The blue of the clear sky that fills the window panes matches the framed gravestone rubbing of a German calligraphy transfer in blue rubbing wax on snow white paper. Topped with an encircled gothic cross medallion, and two wheat branches on the bottom, the gravestone honors the memory of a brave soldier and local hero who died for the Fatherland: Wilhelm Schroter.

Zum Andenken
Anden Krieger
Wilhelm Schroter
Gest Furs Vaterland
RIP

The bleeps of an office phone catch the attention of the studio’s proprietor. “Good Morning, E.K.S Studios. Elizabeth Kinski, speaking.”
“Elizabeth. It’s Bianka Behrami.”
“Yes. Hello, Ms. Behrami,” says Elizabeth as she removes two burgundy cloth gilt novels with patterned end papers and the title of Dead Souls in gold leaf lettering.
“Please, it’s Bianka. Did you receive the Nikolai Gogol works?”
“I’ve been assessing both volumes, replies Elizabeth. I see no problems on the detached cover board or the spine repairs. Their condition, overall, is very impressive.”
“They should be. Cost me enough.”
“An 1886, first edition English translation in original cloth gilt is exceptionally scarce. It’s quite a find, Bianka.”
“Are you familiar with the story, Elizabeth?”
“Yes. No one captures the flaws and faults of man’s mentality and character quite like Gogol.”
“I agree,” says Bianka. “Man is a silly creature of petty evils and self-satisfying vulgarity.”
“True. But we still love them,” says Elizabeth.
Bianka and Elizabeth chuckle in unison.
“Let’s just say we girls enjoy our boy-toys,” says Bianka, “and leave it at that.”
“Well, I’m really excited about this restoration.”
“I’m glad. As I said, the antiquities dealer I referenced in Germany spoke very highly of your studio’s work, Elizabeth. It’s worth the shipping cost to America.”

A fresco of clouds engulfs the high-vaulted ceiling of the dance studio inside the Kinski Estate. “Faust Symphony S. 108” by Franz Liszt fills the room.
Elizabeth Kinski completes a series of fouette turns in a bath of wintery sunlight that beams through oversized, tympana-styled windows.
In Jonathan’s study, a compact disc case for Faust Symphony by Franz Liszt, as inspired by the play Faust by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, sits on a Bose Wave Music Center. A William Dowd 1969 model harpsichord sits in the corner next to the fireplace. A cello sets on a stand, next to a stand with sheet music. Gothic art reproductions of Francisco Goya’s and Peter Paul Rubens’s Satan Devouring his Sons, along with Jean Baptiste Greuze’s Filial Piety and Wicked Son Punished, adorn the walls.
Jonathan reenters the study in lounging wears. He thumbs a copy of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s 1774 novel, The Sorrows of Young Werther. He approaches the room-length bookshelves filled with grimoires, witchcraft books, occult literature, and antique bibles. As he slips Werther into its proper place, he pulls out a copy of Goethe’s 1805 novel, Wilhelm Meister’s Apprenticeship. He takes a seat in a plush leather chair. A brandy decanter and snifter sits on an end table.
Upstairs, in the master bedroom, Charles packs men’s clothing into suitcases.
Meanwhile, Jonathan relaxes in the study as Liszt’s Faust fills the room. As he sips from the snifter, he now reads a red covered, 1633 edition of Poems by J.D by John Donne, with the book’s page opened to “The Flea”:

Mark but this flea,
and mark in this
How little that which thou
deny’st me is;
It sucked me first
and now sucks thee,
And in this flea
our two bloods mingled be.

Jonathan catches a glimpse of Charles in the hallway. “Are my bags ready for Germany?”
“Yes, sir,” says Charles as he pokes his head into the study.
“Do you have a favorite metaphor,” says Jonathan as he closes the book, “from John Donne’s erotic poetry and elegies, Charles?”
“‘By pictures made and marred to kill. How many ways mightst thou perform thy will.’”
“Yes. ‘Witchcraft by a Picture.’ That is a good one. But I find Donne’s comparing a flea biting two lovers, to the act of sperm mingling in the worm, quite arousing.”
“Yes, sir. I agree with your assessment of the text.”
“Could you explain why these were in your room, Charles?” Jonathan holds up a pair of pink leather split-soles ballet shoes—to Charles’s shock. “I am quite fond of this particular pair as well.” Jonathan inhales the aroma of the well-worn leather and adds, “They’re like a well-aged brandy, no?” then rises from the chair and waves the shoe under Charles’s nose. “If not for my diverting your indulgences over my late sister and mother, you’d be turning down cum-stained sheets in some flea-bag hotel.” Jonathan dangles the shoe on his fingertip. The shoe falls to the floor. “Gogol and Goethe were right. We are never satisfied. Are we, Charles?”
“No, sir. We are not.”
“There’s always that one, elusive desire,” says Jonathan as he lifts the snifter and sips, “that weighs us down like Prometheus to a rock,” and gives his valet a reassuring shoulder pat. “Don’t worry, Charles,” adds Jonathan as he slips a red flash drive into Charles’s pocket. “Just be a bit more careful in your indulgences.” With a whisper into Charles’s ear, he adds, “Remember. Our two bloods, mingled be.”

ELIZABETH and Jonathan walk hand-in-hand through New York City’s J.F.K International Airport. Charles keeps pace as he clutches a carry-on bag and a briefcase. They approach signage that indicates “Lufthansa Check In” with directional arrows to the First Class area.
As they approach the check-in desk at the First Class lounge, Jonathan presents his ticket to the hostess.

At the First Class bar, Charles nurses a beverage and thumbs a Wall Street Journal.
In the dining room area beyond the bar, as Jonathan and Elizabeth finish lunch, the blue and yellow tailfin logo of a Lufthansa Airbus taxis beyond a glass curtain wall. Jonathan reads a European science magazine article: “The Super Apple: Could Apple Tree in Switzerland be the Fountain of Youth?” His eye reads: 

. . . derived from a rare 18th century species of apple tree, the plant stem cells of the Uttwiler Spatlauber . . .

“I need to freshen up,” interjects Elizabeth to break his concentration. “I’ll meet you in the lounge, say in five?”
Jonathan nods. As Elizabeth walks off, his iPhone illuminates. A smirk cuts across his face.

In the First Class Lounge, Charles reads a French-language newspaper. In an adjacent seat, Jonathan reads a piece of correspondence from his opened briefcase—addressed from Merck Pharmaceuticals and signed by a “Dr. Bianka Behrami.”
Jonathan’s iPhone illuminates with another pleasant text. The message inspires—Charles also takes notice—Jonathan to trade stares with Charlotte Jungen, a German Lufthansa Air Hostess, who struts through the lounge with her iPhone in hand—and winks at Jonathan.
Elizabeth, consumed in her own iPhone activities, approaches. She sits down and hooks Jonathan’s arm. “The weather reports don’t look promising, Jonathan. You think they’ll cancel the flight?”
“Good afternoon, Ladies and Gentlemen,” opens the public address system with the voice of the hostess from the check-in desk. “Flight 401, with non-stop service from New York to Frankfurt, is now boarding.”
“Well, apparently not,” says Jonathan. “I’ll miss you, tiny dancer.”
Elizabeth flashes a smirk. “I won’t. I have things to keep me occupied, Johnny.”
“Just don’t hurt yourself, Beth.” They share a kiss. “Enjoy your Christmas shopping. I’ll call before I change planes to Leipzig.” Jonathan pulls a billfold from his coat. “Take good care of her, Charles.”
“Yes, sir. Of course. As always.”
“Merry Christmas, Charles,” adds Jonathan as he hands his gentleman a Saks Fifth Avenue Gift Card. “The sky’s the limit. Always within reason.”
“Yes, of course. Thank you, sir. Happy Holidays and a safe flight.”

Jonathan sleeps, tucked away in the first class cabin of the Lufthansa A380 Airbus, with the window sunscreen down and the security screen between the seats, rose.

A majestic clock tower’s distorted reflection mixes with the summertime sun onto the architecture of a blue illuminated, steel-lattice glass pyramid.
Medical professionals stride by a ground-level Merck-entrance sign to the right of the pyramid that serves as the Visitors Reception Center for Merck Pharmaceuticals in Darmstadt, Germany. Jonathan strolls by the Merck entrance sign, into the lobby.
The lobby interior boasts a promotional display in a red typeface set on a paisley background with matching pink flowers and butterflies for a female, blood anemia drug: Sangobion. Another red, pink, and pastel banner advertises the endocrine disease, growth hormone disorder medication: Saizen.
He approaches the reception desk. One receptionist answers incoming calls on a headset. A second receptionist greets in-person visitors. In perfect German, Jonathan says, “I have an appointment with Doctor Bianka Behrami.”
“Yes, Doctor Kinski,” in German, replies the in-person receptionist. “Please have a seat. I will call Doctor Behrami’s assistant.” Before the receptionist can complete her task, Jonathan’s stare turns from the pink pastels of the Saizen promotional display towards the voice of—
“Doctor Kinski.” And Jonathan’s eyes lock on a pair of firm, thirty-something, sheer-hosed legs set in stiletto heels that lead to a curve-fitting business-professional dress and long, cascading dark hair.
Jonathan stands. He tugs at his trousers to conceal his arousal.
“It is so nice to finally meet you,” says Bianka. Without warning, she strokes out Jonathan’s suit jacket breast and pins a visitor’s badge to his chest. “Welcome to Merck Pharmaceuticals.” Bianka’s intoxicating aroma causes his eyes to flutter in ecstasy.

*   *

An Audi R8 Coupe in white Ibis body paint speeds westbound along the A38 Bundesautobahn, west of the city of Markkleeberg.
Bianka jams the shifter.
Jonathan stirs from his slumber. His eyes immediately travel along Bianka’s sheer-hosed legs to the stilettos riding the accelerator and clutch.
Jonathan stares through the windshield and notices the blue and white interchange sign for Exit 31 Leipzig-Sud. Then, another sign for the B2 Bundesstrasse, appears. “Leipzig?” says Jonathan. “Uh, why are we going to Leipzig?”
“I personally see to it that all fellow wine connoisseurs and students of Goethe visit Leipzig’s best known and second oldest win bar,” replies Bianka, as she notices Jonathan’s indulgence of her legs. “Besides,” as she plays under her skirt, “I know the desires of my little Faustus. And I always look for an excuse to take an extended road trip to ride the stick and open it up.” She jams the stick shift.
Her stiletto digs into the accelerator.
Jonathan’s natural reaction: his penis shifts under his trousers in admiration of the flex of Bianka’s foot and calf muscles.

The Madler Passage. A three-story shopping arcade located in a historical shopping district along the street of Grimmaische Strasse 2. Shoppers patronage outdoor vendor booths selling wares at an art fair held along the plaza.
In a crowd, Jonathan and Bianka observe puppeteers who bestow life to German-language marionettes depicting Faust and Mephisto on a booth stage.
“Faustus, what is your desire?”
“Disclose to me what weakness you possess, Mephisto.”
“There is no weakness inside of me, my dear Faustus. By mere thought alone, I can create, a human.”
Bianka, disinterested, glances at her wristwatch. “Our table should be ready.” She takes Jonathan’s hand.
They navigate the crowd, through the Grimmaische Strasse Entrance Hall, a cavernous, three-storied structure bathed in sunlight by way of the hall’s skylight of ribbed concrete and glass that runs the length of the passage. Shoppers patronage an array of distinctive specialty shops and boutiques.
A scarlet passerine, adorned in a gown and corset, feathered headdress and mask, flaps her crimson and yellow wings in a hypnotic dance between the bronze sculptures of Mephisto and Faust and Bewitched Students—displayed on two staircase parapets. The passerine bows before Jonathan as she waves an opened wing towards the Mephisto and Faust sculpture. Jonathan cradles Bianka as he assists in their downward descent of the left master staircase that leads into Auerbach’s Keller; its stairway entrance adorned with a crimson, renaissance-style flag.
Jonathan and Bianka sit under the Faustian designs displayed inside Goethe’s Zimmer (“Cellar” for the non-German folks), a wine parlor rife with gothic, arched ceilings and two semicircular wood paintings depicting Faust Drinking with his Students and Faust Riding out the Door on a Wine Barrel. While Goethe indulges in drink, overhead—
Bianka rubs her silky, sheer-nylon foot along Jonathan’s trouser leg, nudging the cuff upward, ever so slightly.
A waiter approaches, ready to serve two bulbous flasks—with syringes attached to the necks. His arrival cues Bianka to expose her other leg outside of the table’s cloth and dangle the other stiletto to his delight.
“Doctor Behrami. So nice to see you,” says the waiter. “Your usual. Two Auerbach Witches Trunks.”
Bianka nudges a linen napkin onto the floor.
“So, your idea of a ‘usual’ is a Mephisto’s Elixir?” Jonathan removes the flask’s syringe to mix his brew.
The waiter gasps privately, enraptured by the possibilities waiting at the end of that napkin on the floor.
“It’s the only way to toast Goethe’s Wilhelm Meister,” says Bianka, as she sinks the syringe’s plunger. “May we have a more fulfilling life.”
And the waiter fulfills his desires, as he positions his nose near Bianka’s foot.
“Uh, when you’re done, Heinz?” says Bianka as Heinz enjoys the curvature of her leg. “Add a porcelain and chrome Goethe Pillbox on my bill, please.”
“I’ll bring a fresh linen, madam.”
“So, Jonathan. You’ll escort me,” says Bianka as she pops the stiletto back on her other foot under the table, “to the Paris conference in September,” and rubs the shoe’s toe box along Jonathan’s leg, “and protect me from the wolves at the wine festival in Bad Durkheim.”
“But who is protecting me from—.”
Bianka drops the stiletto under the table and pushes her stocking foot into Jonathan’s crouch. His penis shifts. A damp spot appears on his trousers.

Jonathan awakes in the First Class cabin of the Lufthansa A380 Airbus. He knocks a water bottle across the blanket and soaks his trousers. As he brushes off his pants, he presses buttons to raise the window’s sunscreen and lower the seat’s security screen.
Charlotte Jungen approaches. “Did you have a nice nap, Doctor.”
“I had a slight accident, Charlotte.”
Leaning into Jonathan to collect the damp blanket, she whispers, “Was it about me, Johnny? I give a good Christmas gift-fuck, don’t I.”
“Granting all my fantasies at twenty thousand feet, as always, Ms. Jungen.”
“I’ll get a fresh linen, Doctor.”

A banner draped across the steel lattice and glass atrium of the Congress Center in Leipzig, Germany, announces: German Interdisciplinary Meeting on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine, December 4 to 6. Professionally attired doctors adorned in nametags, carry briefcases and laptop bags; they congregate and mingle, and enter the atrium.
Inside the atrium, Jonathan shares a laugh with a Ukrainian doctor, Anton Konrad, along with Dr. Min-So Chang from South Korea, and Dr. Dawood Zardari from Pakistan.
“A fifth for poker? Absolutely,” interjects a French-Canadian accented doctor.
“Poker” fires a synapse in Jonathan brain; his eyes travel across the room to the black designer stilettos and hose-encased legs of Bianka Behrami.
Bianka nudges her twenty-something charge, Kate O’Mara, who peeks at Jonathan and nods a submissive acknowledgement to her boss.
“It’s settled then. My room at eight o’clock,” says Dawood. “Get ready to lose your Euros.”
“I just noticed someone,” says Jonathan. “Will you gentlemen excuse me a moment.” They nod their acknowledgement to him and continue their conversation.
“Ah the smell of cigars,” says Anton.
“And no wives complaining about smoke and moisture rings on the furniture,” says Min-So.
As Jonathan approaches Bianka, Kate O’Mara smiles and saunters off.
“Excuse me, Doctor Behrami?” says Jonathan.
“Yes.”
“I’m Jonathan. Jonathan Kinski.”
“Yes. It’s nice to see a man with the courage to follow the temptations of his eyes.”
“We met at the Merck offices this past summer.” Jonathan questions Bianka’s dismissive facial expression. Then he adds, “The Paris Medical Conference in September?”
“I don’t mean to be rude, Doctor, uh?”
“Kinski. Jonathan Kinski.”
“I meet many doctors. I don’t recall you and I being social.”
“Well, it seems I wasn’t as good as I thought.”
“I believe Merck may have an elixir to cure that, Dr. Kinski.”
“Pardon my candor, Ms. Behrami, but you do not need drugs to cure anyone.”
A playful smile cracks Bianka’s coldness. “Oh, Johnny. It is so good to see you.” She indulges in a quick hug. “How are you?”
“Well enough that you shouldn’t frotter against me,” whispers Jonathan.
“Well, I hope you brought your rubbing wax, Johnny,” whispers Bianka in return.

On the main conference room’s stage, a German doctor lectures from a podium in front of a theatre screen’s PowerPoint presentation of photos that feature arms and backs covered with red sores and peeling scales. “. . . An epidemic sweeping Russia, endangering Europe, and becoming a threat in the United States,” says the doctor to a capacity crowd adorned with earphones; they listen to language translations via laptops and watch PowerPoint duplicates run on the laptop screens.
“Heroin abuse alone is bad enough, but this is not heroine,” continues the German doctor, as patient faces with sores appear on-screen behind him. “Meth eats away at skin tissues, but this isn’t meth,” says the doctor, in-sync with the photos of legs that feature deep, scaly sores. “This is the aftermath of Krokodil. And it is ten times more potent than morphine. Krokodil eats away at human tissues from the inside out, and rots not only flesh, but also bone.”
As photos of feet ravaged by sores appear on user’s laptops, the doctor advises the crowd; “Users develop reptile, scale-like skin with legions that lead to gangrene. Festering, pungent, sores develop within days of injecting Krokodil.”
Although repulsive, the photos of feet engage a synapse in Jonathan’s brain; the corner of his right eye centers on Bianka’s right leg crossed over her left leg. She pops her stiletto and dangles her shoe loose.
“The initial side effects,” continues the lecturing doctor, “present themselves as atypical heroin abuse. As such, emergency rooms are approaching Krokodil as a typical opiate overdose.”
Bianka knows Jonathan’s brain chemicals are also overdosing; she glances at the bulge in his crouch. She pops her stiletto back on and rotates her right foot; the anklet sparkles.
“Codeine is the base,” continues the German doctor, “with other household fluids such as petrol, kerosene, paint thinner and even lithium extracted from batteries—all to create euphoric, deadly results.”
Bianka shifts the corner of her left eye to Jonathan. She slides the water bottle spout between her lips takes a seductive swig.
Jonathan’s eyes flutter—his brain drunk with sinful lust and desire.

In the dining area arranged in the atrium, medical professionals sit in parties of eight around fifty banquet tables adorned in white linen with red and pink floral centerpieces. As busboys clear tables, waiters and waitresses serve coffee with cake.
Meanwhile, under a table, a female’s stocking-clad foot rubs, then withdrawals from the calf of a man’s trouser cuff. “Well, Andy, Minny, Woody, it’s been a pleasure meeting each of you,” says Bianka.
Jonathan and Bianka sit next to each other. Three unoccupied seats have empty coffee cups, crumbly cake plates, and used linen napkins. Dr. Anton Konrad, Dr. Min-So Chang, and Dr. Dawood Zardari sit on the other side of Jonathan and Bianka.
“Remember, if you need anything, you have my cards,” says Bianka as her foot slips back into the stiletto under the table. “I’ll ship your samples as soon as I return to Darmstadt corporate. It was so nice running into you, Jonathan.” She shakes his hand. “Thanks for the lunch invite. If you gentlemen will excuse me, kindly.”
The men rise. Then sit down and trade stares as Bianka slithers off.
Anton lets out a deep sigh. “Lena would use her surgeon skills to chop it off if she found out what I was thinking.”
“Physician heal thy aching in your crouch,” interjects Woody. “You think she’d toss in a pair of panties into those samples?”
“I’d let her eat me alive,” adds Minny. “And so help me god, I’d enjoy every bite.”
“So, Jonathan,” says Anton. “Did you fu—.”
Jonathan’s iPhone rings. He looks at the Caller ID: “Tiny Dancer.” “I’ve been saved by the bell.”
“You never heard bell in your life, Pavlov,” says Anton.
“Which is why you dogs should call your bitches,” replies Jonathan. He rises and walks off, backed by the chuckles of Bianka’s new fan club. “Hey, Beth. . . . No, just finishing a lunch break with Andy, Minny, and Woody. . . . Oh, colorful pictures of diseased flesh. . . .”
Meanwhile, inside the ladies’ restroom: Bianka checks the stalls, then gives a quick test-turn to the front door’s deadbolt. She sends a text on her iPhone.
Kate O’Mara arrives at the exterior of the front door to the restroom and sends a text: “I feel more like a pledge, than your assistant, Ms. Behrami.”
“Sorority sisters for life,” Bianka texts in reply. “My little concubine for eternity” appears on Kate’s iPhone screen.

A stall door busts open in the ladies’ restroom. Jonathan pushes Bianka into the stall. She positions herself on the toilet tank, then unzips Jonathan and pushes up her skirt. . . .
Jonathan and Bianka straighten up in the mirror. Jonathan places his arm around her, supports her. She feigns wooziness; an illness. They exit the restroom inside the atrium at the Congress Center in Leipzig.

As a female guest begins to enter the ladies’ restroom located off the lobby inside the Hotel Le Meurice in Paris, France, she gasps at the emergence of Jonathan supporting a slightly woozy Bianka. In a perfect French accent, Jonathan explains away the social faux pas: “I’m sorry to startle you. My colleague became ill.”
“Is there anything I can do to help, Jonathan?” says the French female guest.
“She just needs some fresh air, Sara. Thank you for offering.”
As Sara enters the restroom, a concierge approaches. “Is everything alright, Doctor Kinski?” inquires the concierge in French-accented English.
“Yes, just a dizzy spell is all. Thank you for your kindness, Robert.”
Jonathan escorts Bianka as they stumble by a lobby card that announces: September 2 to 6: Paris Medical Congress Welcomes European College of Neuropsychopharmacology Congress. They exit the hotel’s glass-revolving doors.
The Hotel Meurice: a five star hotel of kings stands opposite of the topiary boxes of Tuileries Gardens along the Seine River. Traffic bustles along the Rue De Rivola as Jonathan and Bianka navigate the pedestrian-busy sidewalk.
“We did not just do that. I’m dreaming this, right,” Jonathan beams in disbelief at Bianka.
“Wasn’t it Johann Goethe who said, ‘Whatever you can do or dream, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it.’”
“Lilith and Empusa have nothing on you. You’re one hell of a woman, Bianka.”
“Who always owns your penis. And you are such a good tenant, Johnny.”

Jonathan and Bianka’s image reflects off the steel lattice glass pyramid in the courtyard of the Louve Museum. Bianka snaps a selfie with her iPhone. She glances at the digital photo that accentuates her reflective, green eyes.

A new day arises inside the 19th century-styled decor of the Belle Etoile Royal Suite perched atop the Hotel Le Meurice.
As Bianka leans over the vanity to apply cosmetics, Jonathan rubs his hair with a towel, tightens his robe and exits the Italian-marbled bathroom.
He strolls through a walk-in closet and passes the unmade canopy bed. As he draws back the window dressing, his reflection in the window pane gives way to the seventh-floor view of the Seine River, then onto the box topiaries of Tuileries Gardens.
“Uh, Lilith would love a cup of coffee,” Bianka calls from the master bedroom.

In the kitchen, Jonathan pours two cups on saucers from a carafe, and then places the china settings on a serving tray.

In the sitting room, Jonathan sips his coffee as he reviews a Google Map on laptop that plots the northern route from “Wissembourg, France,” to “Bad Durkheim, Germany.” He clicks the web browser’s second tab to reveal another Google Map that plots the western route across the Bad Durkheim district in Rhineland-Palatinate; as he engages the zoom feature, he concentrates on the western border and the “Village of Frankenstein.”
Jonathan rises; he carries his cup and saucer as he steps into a 360-degree panorama of Notre Dame, the Louve Museum, the Musee d’Orsay, the Eiffel Tower, the Obelisk at the Place de la Concorde, and the Arc de Triompe seen from the suite’s rooftop private terrace.
Adorned in a robe, Bianka pulls a brush through her hair. After a sip of coffee, she inserts a pair of post-style gold Eagle earrings. She exits the master bathroom onto the rooftop private terrace and comes up behind Jonathan. They share an embrace and a kiss.
Upon his notice of Bianka’s ears, Jonathan says, “She mounts up with wings as eagles.”
“But who will weary first, Johnny?” replies Bianka.
“You tell me,” says Jonathan as his teeth reach for her ear.
“Careful with the nibbling, they’re antiques. Poppa gave them to me.” Bianka takes Jonathan’s hand and guides him off the terrace. “So, how about a quick mounting before we pave the road with our bad intentions?”

Bianka’s Audi R8 Coupe races northbound along the two-lane rural passage of the D264/Route de Schweigen. They leave the French border town of Wissembourg.
As they cross the German border, onto the B38/Bundesstrassen, a yellow road sign appears with a stylized bunch of ten black grapes.
A route sign for Deutsche Weinstasse appears. The sign gives way to their passage through an imposing, sandstone ceremonial gatehouse: The German Wine Gate at Schweigen-Rechtenbach. Vineyards, chestnut trees, and almond blossoms reflect through the Audi’s windows.
In the town of Ruppertsberg, a rectangular, yellow road sign adorned in black trim announces the B271/Bundesstrassen. The Audi then speeds through the overpass for the K10/Hauptstrasse. Bianka follows the exit sign.
“And we’re turning off in Ruppertsburg, for?” questions Jonathan.
“A little frottering surprise, my little Faustus,” replies Bianka.

The Audi snakes along a narrow road that cuts through the endless rows of grapes of the vast wine fields, just off the K10/Hauptstrasse.
“Where in the hell are we, Bianka?”
“Exactly. And there it is.”
Just south of the K10, west of the B271, the Audi pulls into a grass clearing near an engraved, religious landmark of a field cross with a Jesus Christ bronze on a crucifix.
“So, are you ready for a little Faustian consorting with the Devil, Johnny?” Bianka pops the trunk. “You get your art supplies. I’ll set up lunch.”

An open gravestone rubbing kit of charcoal sticks, colored-cupcake rubbing waxes, a painter’s tape roll, spray adhesive, a soft brush, and an artist tube sits at the base of the Jesus Christ field cross. Jonathan rubs wax onto the adhered white rubbing paper.
Bianka opens a red and white gingham-lined, rattan picnic basket with a merlot glass service for two and two insulated wine duffels.

At the base of another, nearby Field Cross: a picnic lunch of fruits and cheeses consumed. Jonathan sits behind and cradles Bianka. He guides her hand as it clutches a cake of blue rubbing wax, across the white rubbing paper taped at the corners. Calligraphy transfers in blue wax for a local hero: “Wilhelm Schroter.” Topped with an encircled gothic cross medallion and two wheat branches on the bottom, the rubbing reads:

Zum Anderken
Anden Krieger
Wilhelm Schroter
Gest Furs Vaterland
RIP

“That’s it. Very gently, Bianka.” Don’t damage the stonework.”

Back under the Jesus Christ bronze, Jonathan lies on a blanket on his back; his arms spread out in mimic of the crucifix.
Jesus Christ gazes down at their sin.
Bianka straddles Jonathan, picks up the merlot bottle and pulls the cork with her teeth. She teases him with a red merlot drop onto his lips from the bottle’s mouth. She takes a purposeful swig. She leans over and spits a merlot cascade into his mouth.

North of Ruppertsburg, in Bad Durkheim, Jonathan naps in the passenger seat of the Audi.
They drive under the entrance banner: Wurstmarkt Wine Tasting Festival. Bad Durkheim. September 6 to 10 and 13 to 16. 10 AM to 1 AM. As the Audi parks, tourists enter the festival grounds. Bianka gives a little wake up rub to Jonathan’s crouch. “Hmmm. And you are playing with?”
“Who do you think?”
“You think I believe that, Johnny?”
Jonathan nods. Of course he was fucking someone else. He always is. Why lie?

Jonathan and Bianka navigate through the tourists who enjoy an assortment of carnival rides. A giant Ferris wheel spins. Patrons enjoy local cuisines and music.
As they pose in front of the festival’s landmark: The World’s Largest Wine Barrel, a male German tourist snaps Jonathan and Bianka’s image. He hands the iPhone back to Bianka. They thank the German tourist and walk off.
Their drafted “photographer” focuses on Bianka’s slink into the crowd.
Later on, hidden among tourists, he films Bianka on his own iPhone.

Bianka’s Audi R8 Coupe speeds along Kehre, a winding, tree-lined two-lane road east of Bad Durkheim. A square, yellow road sign directs travelers to the municipality district of Frankenstein Kreis Kaiserslautern. A rectangular, blue road sign fastened to a highway light pole appears for Frankenstein (Pflaz).
Then they view the red limestone ruins of Frankenstein’s Castle perched upon a stone spur that overlooks the village of Frankenstein—nestled in the Palatinate Forest.
The Audi parks in a clearing at a railroad crossing. Bianka pops the trunk and carries a wine duffel, a professional-grade digital camera, and a blanket. Jonathan carries his gravestone rubbing kit and an artist tube.
“This is perfect, Bianka. No admission or visitor center and everyone is at Wurstmarkt. The castle is ours.”
As they walk toward the cemetery beneath the shadows of the ruins, their “photographer” parks his car. He pulls out his iPhone and films.
Jonathan and Bianka make-out as they trudge by crumbly tombstones beneath the castle ruins. In the shadows, their friend from Wurstmarkt slinks behind trees. He positions himself behind a brittle tombstone: Frankenstein - 1400—as he films Bianka.
Jonathan and Bianka reach a path at the castle base. She grimaces at the steepness. “It’ll be worth it for the tower view. Just hold on tight,” assures Jonathan.

Bianka’s camera focuses on a 190-degree view of the Village of Frankenstein.
Then her view drifts down to the main floor, as sun streaks through the exposed roof. She focuses her shot on a flock of white doves perched on a craggy bolder.
Spooked, the doves fly through the open roof into a clear, blue sky.
The flight fails to stir Jonathan, deep in thought. He focuses on the glide of the cupcake rubbing wax as it exposes surrealistic images of walls on the rubbing paper.
As she clutches the neck of a burgundy wine bottle, Bianka struts toward Jonathan. She comes up behind him and says, “Now, it’s my turn to frotter something,” and reaches around and under him.
“Physician, heal thy aching in my crouch,” says Jonathan.
Bianka stops his attempt at a kiss with a finger tip to his lips. She hands him the burgundy wine bottle. As she reveals the porcelain and chrome Goethe Pillbox purchased earlier, which features the silhouette and signature of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, she tells Jonathan, “In the Book of Luke Ten, verse eighteen, he said unto them, ‘I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.’” Bianka pops the pillbox lid to expose three compartments. “Just little treats from the lightning god, Zeus.” Inside, the Goethe tin overflows with white pills, each emblazoned with Satanic “S” lightning bolts. “Here’s to Anton Kollisch. Merck’s greatest prodigy chemist and the pride of Darmstadt.” She places a white pill on her tongue.
“And to the town’s second greatest medical son, Johann Dippel,” says Jonathan as Bianka swigs from the bottle and swallows. “Ironic the patent for Ecstasy was filed on Christmas Day.”
“And you’re dying to open my little gift box, aren’t you, Johnny?”
Bianka places a second white pill on her tongue. She kisses Jonathan; he swallows the pill, then swigs from the wine bottle. As they consume each other’s lips in a second kiss, they collapse onto the blanket beneath them. She mounts him; undoes his trousers. She begins a rhythmic bounce on his waist line.
Meanwhile, concealed in shadows, their photographer-friend films their tryst with his iPhone. He unzips.

Jonathan and Bianka’s relaxed, hazed exhaustion breaks at the crunch of boots on the decay of leafy debris. With his non-filming hand, their Wurstmarkt friend opens his coat to expose a waistband-tucked handgun. He tosses a roll of duct tape at Jonathan.
Jonathan doesn’t process the tape roll. He stares with glazed eyes.
“Really, Wilh. You follow me, and that’s the best you’ve got? What a waste of an eternal peace,” scoffs Bianka.
Wilhelm Schroter’s face drains cold.
“Now, let me heal that aching in your dead, dry crouch, little Willy.”
Wilh clutches his crouch and groans in agony. A switchblade falls from his coat.
“Johnny, sweetie? A little help.”
Wihl’s pants soak with blood. He collapses on the ground and withers in pain.
“I don’t let just anyone open my Pandora’s Box, little Willy,” says Bianka as she hands Jonathan the switchblade. “Help me get him onto the boulder.” As they lift Wilh and stretch him over the rock face, Bianka plunges the switchblade into and carves his stomach. She burrows her hand into the wound and extracts Wilh’s liver. She takes a deep, purposefully bite. She chews and swallows. “Hmmm. It rejuvenates your emotions and tastes like eternity.” Bianka holds the liver to Jonathan’s mouth. “Go ahead, Johnny. Our little Prometheus won’t mind.” As she rubs the liver onto Jonathan’s lips, she says, “Come on, Johnny. Remember what Goethe said to God, through his poem, ‘Prometheus.’”
On cue, Jonathan recites in German: “‘When I was a child, I spake as a child—.’”
“And you understood as a child; you thought as a child.” Bianka takes a purposeful lick of the liver. “But now, it’s time to become a man. To put away childish things.” She places the liver before his lips. “Go ahead, Johnny. Be a man.”
Jonathan opens wide and bites down on the liver. Blood squirts across Bianka’s face. She sighs in ecstasy.

“Oh, good. You’re awake,” interjects the disembodied voice of Elizabeth.

SNOW falls at the Kinski Estate.
Elizabeth, with a towel around her neck and in sweaty ballet wears, peeks through the ajar doorway of their master bedroom. An exhausted Jonathan sits on the bed’s edge. She removes one of her pink leather split-sole ballet shoes and tosses it on Jonathan’s lap. Then the second shoe. “Consider them an early Christmas gift.” She pushes him down, mounts him.
“How long was I out?”
“Long enough.” Elizabeth gives him a deep kiss. “I gave Charles the night off.”
“That’s, uh, fine.”
“So, the Leipzig medical conference was productive.”
Jonathan doesn’t process the meaning.
“The Darmstadt Trunk arrived?” says Elizabeth.
“Trunk? Right. The trunk.” Jonathan twirls his finger at his temple. “Jetlag.”
“Johnny, you’re going to tease me with those keys, aren’t you.”
Jonathan doesn’t process the meaning.
“That must have been some flight.”
Jonathan gazes in puzzled silence.
“The letter from the antique store said they gave you the keys, Johnny.”
Jonathan is a blank slate.
“Wow. Curl up and nap. I’ll talk care of your bags, sweetie.”
As Jonathan climbs under the bedding and drifts away, Elizabeth unpacks his suitcases and finds a white, manila business-class envelope with a return address label for an antiquities establishment on Elisabethenstrasse (road): F.B Antiquitaten Buchen of Darmstadt, Germany; an envelope which features a simple company logo of a black triskelion and “Jonathan Kinksi” transcribed in blood-red ink.
As her fingers crack the envelope’s back flap, she fails to notice the intricate, sinister details of the envelope’s yellow wax seal that features three, small pentagrams wrapped inside the triple spirals of a triskelion. An ornate, silver key—with a bow design identical to the wax seal, which also fails to raise any alarms in her mind—spills out of the envelope. She removes and peeks at the pink bill of lading for the trunk. She places the triskelion key and lading slip back into the envelope and places it on the nightstand next to Jonathan’s side of the bed.
Later, Jonathan awakes to the envelope; he opens it and the triskelion key spills out. As he rubs the three pentagrams engraved into the key’s bow between his fingers, he hears Elizabeth’s disembodied voice: “The letter from the antique store said they gave you the keys.”

Kate O’Mara, Bianka’s little concubine, stands at the women’s restroom door inside the Congress Center in Leipzig, Germany. A female doctor approaches. “A colleague of mine became ill. A custodian is inside cleaning up. There’s another facility just beyond the visitor’s desk.” As the doctor walks off, Kate sends a text on her iPhone to Bianka.
Inside the rest room, Jonathan and Bianka straighten up in a mirror. Bianka reads the text, then texts back; she pops the deadbolt. Kate sneaks out Jonathan.
Jonathan, with a sexually satisfied demeanor, and Bianka, vibrant with her never depleted sexual energy, navigate the parked cars in the lot of the Congress Center and approach her Audi R8 Coupe. “Enough of the dead skin seminar,” says Bianka as she tosses the Audi’s keys to Jonathan. “I need my hands free to play in the devil’s workshop.”

As the Audi R8 Coupe speeds outside Ehringshausen, Bianka moans; ecstasy washes over her face. “Faster, Johnny. Faster.” Jonathan jams the stick shifter. Bianka fingers herself. He hosed feet curl into the dashboard. She climaxes.
East of the city, southwest bound on the A5 from Leipzig to Darmstadt, Bianka’s hosed feet dance with delight on the windshield. “No drug will ever do me like that. I’m addicted to you, Johnny. Stay.”
“I can’t blow off Christmas and a production of The Nutcracker.
“And I love blowing nuts. I guess you’ll attend church services, too?”
“I don’t impose my duplicity on Elizabeth. Or with Barbara.”
“Well, your body is my altar. And I only kneel to what’s between there,” as she clutches Jonathan’s steeple. “Once you meet my Poppa, you’ll see he’s not a crusty, old fossil lost in foolish traditions.”
Jonathan climaxes.
“Poppa understands men have needs,” says Bianka as she licks her fingers clean. “And my knack,” as her tongue moistens her lips, “for filling their prescriptions.”

A weathered, yet meaty hand fiddles with a red, gothic cross medallion-on-white porcelain cuff link that belongs to the sixty-year-old Fritz Behrami—the proprietor of F.B Antiquitaten Buchen, in Darmstadt, Germany. The music of “Faust Symphony S.108” by Franz Liszt echoes across the stores open floor plan that features two floors of books, along with an interior balcony that encircles the second floor. The plate glass of the front entrance door features a black triskelion logo; an antique brass bell hangs above the door.
The bells clangs as Jonathan and Bianka enter. “Poppa!” says Bianka as she runs into her father’s arms.
Fritz gives her a deep hug. “Bee-Bee Doll. How is my fallen angel?” Fritz kisses her forehead. “Still bad as ever?”
“Worse, Poppa.”
“Mr. Kinksi. Welcome to my humble, little shop. Bee-Bee speaks highly of you.” Fritz’s jovial greeting leads to a whisper. “Perhaps you make an honest woman out of my Bee-Bee,” as he stares at Bianka, “and give me some grandchildren.”
“Poppa, men wouldn’t like all of this with all of that,” replies Bianka as her hands accent her body curves and mocks a pregnant belly.
Jonathan gazes at the store’s two floors of books, armories, furniture, chests, art works, sculptures, and glassware. He takes notice of the Middle Ages-era weapons of Morning Stars and Holy Water Sprinklers on the shops walls. Then, on a wall behind the clerk’s customer service counter, Jonathan notices a photograph of the acclaimed opera singer, Ezio Pinza—as he plays a cittern in portrayal of the Faustian character—
“Ah, my Mephistopheles has caught your eye, Jonathan,” says Fritz.
“Ezio Pinza? Of course, Mr. Behrami. How could I not know the greatest bass to grace the New York Metropolitan Opera stage.”
“Ah, a fellow fan of Parisian composer, Charles Gounod. How wonderful a man you found, Bee-Bee. And please,” as he pats Jonathan’s shoulder, “it is Fritz to all my friends.”
Fritz’s warmth breaks a smile across Jonathan’s face.
“Notice the autograph, Jonathan,” says Bianka. My father had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Pinza after one of his Faust performances.”
Then, the blood drains from Jonathan face. Rapid heartbeats thumps echo across the caverns of his now hollow mind; a sweat breaks over his body. He realizes his body dangles from the ceiling by strings attached to his shoulders and wrists, elbows and knees. He gazes toward Fritz with a questioning look.
“Of course. Your sweet Babs and Beth,” responds Fritz. “I shall teach you to create with your hands, what I create by mere thought.”
Jonathan faints. His marionette strings snap; he collapses to the floor in a silent, groggy consciousness.
“But I do apologize, Jonathan,” says Fritz as he stares down at the fleshy puddle that is Jonathan. “Your dear Melanie is lost.” As Fritz holds out his hands, palms down, he raises his arms and moves his fingers.
Jonathan rises, pulled up and guided by invisible marionette strings. He notices the distorted views of Bianka, Barbara, and Elizabeth. Engaged in lesbian intercourse, Jonathan’s Three Fates gulp from three bulbous flasks—Auerbach Witches Trunks.
Jonathan then notices Fritz holds at bay, a collared, twenty-four-year-old Melanie Kinksi—her hairy, hoofed left leg is that of a donkey. She willingly follows Fritz’s lead-by-leash towards a weathered, wooden trunk encased in black iron hinges, latches, strapping, and an antique padlock.
“I believe this is what you’re searching for, my boy,” says Fritz as he waves his free hand in presentation to the trunk.
In trance, Jonathan plods to the trunk. Fritz slips a white bill of lading to Jonathan. A thick, yellow liquid plops onto the lading slip. Jonathan sticks a white quill pen into the yellow “ink” and signs.
Bianka licks off her fingers.
“I’ll ship today to assure Elizabeth receives the trunk before Christmas. I apologize about the key,” says Fritz. “I know it is around here somewhere. It will turn up before you leave for Frankfurt. I’ll messenger it to your suite.”
Bianka then straddles Jonathan over the trunk. She plunges her eagle-clawed hand into his abdomen and rips out his liver. Jonathan’s eyes flutter, his mind lost in a seventh heaven. “Fresh from the oven, Poppa,” says Bianka as she presents the organ.
Fritz takes the fleshy mass from Bianka’s hand and takes a long, purposeful lick. “You did good, dearest Bee-Bee.” Then, with a purposeful enjoyment, Fritz sinks his teeth into the liver. Jonathan gasps with delight; his body spasms in unison with each of Fritz’s chews. Fritz swallows and wipes a blood trip from the corner of his mouth. “He tastes like eternity.” Fritz tosses the liver remains to a cat-shrieking Elizabeth and Barbara.
As Jonathan’s wives screech and dive onto his body and devour his liver, he cries out in orgasmic glee.
A yellow “wax” oozes from the sides of a medieval-era seal matrix pressed into the envelope’s rear flap. As Fritz’s weathered, meaty hand lifts away the matrix, it impresses a signet of three, small pentagrams wrapped inside the triple spirals of a triskelion.
“Johnny. Johnny?” calls out the disembodied voice of a kinder, gentler, Bianka.
Sprawled an ornate couch in the backroom of Fritz’s humble, little shop, Bianka lifts open Jonathan’s eyes and examines his pupils. Fritz enters with a medical bag. “Thank you, Poppa. He’s awake.” Fritz and Bianka help Jonathan sit upright. Bianka removes a vial and syringe. She injects Jonathan; the shot awakens him and induces a coughing fit.
As Jonathan regains focus, he sees Fritz’s head morph into a horned demon . . . then back into human form. “Seems you had a touch of Stendhal Syndrome, my boy,” an explanation that Jonathan fails to process. Fritz removes a handkerchief from inside his blazer and dabs Jonathan’s forehead. “It’s a psychosomatic illness,” continues Fritz, “experienced when overwhelmed by too many works of art in museums or churches, or in my humble, little shop.”
“He knows what a psychosomatic illness is, Poppa. Explaining Hyperkulturmia to a doctor of his stature. Really, Poppa.”
“Okay, Okay. Fritz is just a simple man who buys and sells objects.”
As the injected drug brings Jonathan back to “reality,” the music of Franz Liszt’s “Faust Symphony S. 108” that once haunted his mind . . . fades into silence.

Elizabeth’s disembodied voice beckons, “You know what’s really weird about this trunk, Johnny?”

IN Elizabeth’s calligraphy studio inside the Kinski Estate, a white sheet snaps across the floor in front of the same weathered, Darmstadt wooden trunk.
“It has the same postmark as those Gogol’s volumes I’m restoring,” says Elizabeth as she and Jonathan slip on white cloth gloves.
“Well, the antique store took care of all the shipping details, Beth,” says Jonathan as she spills out the triskelion key from the white manila envelope, oblivious to its sinister casting.
“And you’re still not going to tell me,” says Elizabeth as she clutches the key in her gloved hand and caresses Jonathan’s cheek and chin with the key’s bow.
“Its two Christmas gifts in one,” says Jonathan as Elizabeth inserts the key into the padlock.
“Oh, wow,” she exclaims as the lid creaks open.
The opened trunk reveals a pink paisley interior filled with bound journals and handmade assembled books. Folded documents drafted on vellums, along with parchments tucked under the lid’s memo board, line the interior. A black leather ring box shares a space, tucked away against the memo board.
“Thank you, Jonathan.” Elizabeth removes and opens the ring box. “Es Fui Sum Eris? Uh, alright. Creepy.”
“As you are, so once was I,” whispers an unheard, breathless female presence in the room.
“Memento Mori cuff links. Nice.” Jonathan mocks in his best Bela Lugosi voice: “They’re coming to get you, Elizabeth.”
“Cut it out, Jonathan. Don’t tease.”
“They look like pure silver, cast from an antique wax seal,” admires Jonathan.
“A pair of skulls missing their jaws? You will not wear those to our social engagements, Johnny. In fact, they’re never to leave your cuff links collection.”
“You’re the boss, Beth.”
“Forever and always,” says Elizabeth with a kiss to Jonathan’s lips. She pulls a document from the memo board. As she unfolds the document, it reveals an anatomical ink rendering of a human skeleton. “The illustrations and calligraphy are exquisite. I can frame and sell this, easy.”
The unknown presence in the room swoops down in anger; it exhales deep heaves over Elizabeth’s shoulder.
“You know what, Beth? This trunk looks like it may have belonged to a doctor.” Jonathan removes a bound journal; Elizabeth an assembled book. “These are sketches of anatomical body maps. Hearts, lungs, arteries, muscles. Diagrams of the human eye,” notices Jonathan.
“They’re beautiful,” replies Elizabeth. She begins to read a passage from the assembled book in her hands. “The consumption of the recently deceased from the same community guides said soul into the bodies of its living descendants.” The passage inspires her to push the book off on Jonathan. “Oh, yuck. Yuck. Take it, Johnny. Take it.”
“The consumption of an enemy’s internal organs,” continues Jonathan as he reads the next passage from the assembled book, “will endow the victor with the characteristics of the deceased.”
“What possessed you to buy these, Johnny? Did you buy these for me, or for you?”
“Well, it’s a box of books, Beth. And you do restore and sell antique books,” says Jonathan as he rubs away Elizabeth’s goose bumps in comfort. “It can’t hurt you. It’s just old alchemy and medical journals.”
“I think we’ll leave the acquisitions in Allison’s hands, sweetie.”
Jonathan expresses sorrow.
“You couldn’t have known. The letter from the antique house said at the time you bought it, the key was misplaced.” Elizabeth reaches into the trunk’s main compartment and removes a 5-inch by 2-inch by 2-inch wooden, oak box. She opens it. “Oh, my god. There’s body parts? I am out of here.”
“It’s just a calcified index finger,” says Jonathan as Elizabeth rises to leave the studio. “A medical sample can’t hurt you, Beth.”
“I’m not reconditioning or framing any of it.”
“But there’s a market for medical antiques—.”
“That creepy trunk is all yours, Jonathan.
“Come on, Beth. I thought we’d explore the trunk together.”
Elizabeth flicks and dusts at her overalls. “You and Charles get those yucky things into your library.” As she peels off the white gloves, she makes a realization: “Oh god. All this dust on me is probably the ashes of poor, dead souls.”
Jonathan snickers at Elizabeth’s response. After she dashes out of the studio, Jonathan takes an interest in the white, petrified appendage. As he taps it, he notices its sound and quality of fine porcelain. He picks up the assembled book rejected by Elizabeth and reads the page’s next passage:

As I grow closer to the key of conquering death,
to reconstitute life, preserve eternal youth,
and create immortality. . . .

Evening falls on the Kinski Estate.
In his and Elizabeth’s master bedroom, Jonathan stands at the vanity mirror, adorned in a tailored suit. He opens the lid on two, brown crocodile leather, 12-inch by 8-inch by 6-inch display cases that contain a collection of vintage cuff links. He picks out those memento mori cuff links from the Darmstadt Trunk.
“Es Fui Sum Eris,” calls out the whispered tones of what is Bianka’s unheard, disembodied voice. As Jonathan places the cuff links back into the setting, Bianka repeats, “Es Fui Sum Eris.”
Jonathan then selects a pair of cuff links with a red gothic cross medallion on white background. He experiences a sense of . . . unable to recall the links are identical to the pair worn by Bianka’s father, Fritz—and their similarity to the cross medallion on the Wilhelm Schroter blue gravestone rubbing that hangs in Elizabeth’s studio. He holds the cuff links against his red, silk necktie. He fastens his sleeves.
In the foyer, a mahogany grandfather clock stands over six feet tall with an arched top that features an ominous, carved owl that keeps watch over the clock’s rolling movements of the sun and moon. Jonathan adjusts his red neck tie in the clock’s glass door. He opens the door, picks up the key crank, inserts it into the arch’s shaped brass dial and winds the clockwork. He adjusts the minute hands to the top of the hour. Six clock chimes fill the foyer as Elizabeth enters. Jonathan pulls a pink paisley scarf from his inside jacket pocket. He takes her hand.
“And what are you up too?” says Elizabeth.
“Just turn around,” replies Jonathan as he secures the scarf around Elizabeth’s eyes. “No peeking.”
“You better hold on. I’m in your favorite ‘fuck me’ pumps,” says Elizabeth as she treads lightly to Jonathan’s lead.
As they enter the family room, an 8-inch by 4-inch by 4-inch pink paper and ribbon gift box sits on the grand piano. “This ‘surprise’ better make up for that creepy trunk,” says Elizabeth.
“The trunk was just on a whim,” says Jonathan as he removes her blindfold. “This is the real gift I planned for you.” Elizabeth tears away the paper. “It’s your favorite childhood toy.”
“Jonathan!”
“When it comes to you,” says Jonathan as he hugs her from behind, “nothing is impossible.”
Elizabeth removes the occupant of the box—a vintage, wind-up mechanical ballroom Cinderella doll adorned in a blue crinoline dress. “Where did you ever. . . . This is a real British Wells Brimtoy clockwork fairy queen from the 1950s.”
Jonathan hands Elizabeth the doll’s key crank. “I found a retired toy maker who once worked for Wells to recondition it.”
“You mean it actually works? I can’t wait to display it in my doll room.” Elizabeth winds the doll. It springs to life and dances across the grand piano’s surface.

THE banner draped across the exterior of the Westchester County Center in White Plains, New York, announces the evening’s event: Pyotr Tchaikovsky’s The Nutcracker. Presented by the Westchester Ballet Company.
Inside, a romantic Jonathan and Elizabeth focus on the stage: A carved, owl-topped grandmother clock set at 8 p.m leads into the ending of “Act 1: Scene 1, No. 5 ‘Arrival of Drosselmeyer’”; it segues into “No. 6 ‘Dance of the Mechanical Dolls, a. Harlequin and Columbine.’” Four soldiers flank two, six foot tall boxes adorned in pink paper and ribbon. A maid and butler fuss over the boxes. The soldiers lift away the boxes to reveal Harlequin and Columbine—who begin their dance.
And Jonathan stares into Elizabeth, drawn deep into the whites of her eyes. . . .

And he sees Elizabeth’s breasts bounce over his face; his body propped against the rear bench seat of a ten-seat passenger limousine that speeds along the Connecticut Turnpike.
Wilhelm Schroter sits in the drive seat of the chauffeur cabin; he leans into the privacy screen behind his head.
As Jonathan enjoys his fuck, with his favorite pair of Elizabeth’s ‘fuck me’ pumps wrapped around his back, he closes his eyes. He sees and hears. . . .

“Act 2: Scene 2, No. 14 Pas de Deux, Variation II: ‘Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy’”; his mind drifts back to the stage of the David H. Koch Theatre in New York City, where Elizabeth, adorned in a snow white tutu, glides across the stage as the Sugar Plum Fairy. . . .

Jonathan’s vision of Elizabeth as the Sugar Plum Fairy on the stage of the Koch Theatre results in his sexual climax inside the limousine. And this time, he startles as he hears the haunt of Bianka’s angry whisper: “As you are, so once was I.”
Meanwhile, as Wilhelm satisfies his own climax in the front seat, he turns his attentions back to the road—too late.
The limousine skids.
Elizabeth loses her balance. She cracks her head on the corner of the wet bar. Burgundy wine splashes across her dress in a five-petalled floral pattern—a dog rose—to the sound of metal-on-metal impact.

An explosion rips across the sun-scorched sands of a non-descript patch of desert in the Middle East, under the hail of machine gun fire.
“I.E.D. I.E.D!” cracks a radio communication with a female marine’s voice. “Look for a target, Jimbo! Look for a target!”
A twenty-four-year-old Melanie Kinski, a First Lieutenant Marine, sits in the passenger seat of a military Humvee driven by another female marine. Jimbo operates the roof-top gun turret.
“This is leader,” urges Melanie. “Recon Echo is under mortar fire on road leading to the airport. Repeat. Convoy is under—.” Before Melanie can complete the transmission, a second explosion rips through the floorboards.

*   *
*

Jonathan shocks awake from his dream about Melanie.
He sits in a chair inside the family room of the Kinski Estate. A gold eagle-headed walking stick rests against the chair. He picks up a multimedia remote from the end table and turns off the soulful beat of “Who Will Pay Reparations for My Soul,” a 1970 tune by Gil Scott Heron.
Jonathan’s mind switches gears; he attempts to solve the puzzle of the scattered women’s summer clothes and three duffle bags filled with ballet wares in the room. He hears water splashes from the outdoors. Inspired, he clutches the walking stick and limps on his injured right leg—toward the voices of the teenage girls; he slides the window open.
He gazes in question at the estate’s Olympic-sized swimming pool and sees three, eighteen-year-old girls adorned in one-piece swimsuits from Hopkins Prep School of New Haven, Connecticut. They cheer for two other girls in a breaststroke competition.
Then his concentration breaks; he notices someone stares back at him from the window of the pool house located on the other side of the pool. The girls, however, do not notice their pool house admirer.

Inside the pool house, a thirteen-year-old Jonathan peeks out of the window. He clutches a pink satin pointe shoe. His arm moves rapidly; he cums into the shoe. He shuts the window.
“Those better not be mine, again,” says a voice from behind.
Disheveled, in his Hopkins Prep School uniform and unzipped khakis, the younger Jonathan turns around.
“I guess we’ll have to padlock the pool house, too. You little freak.” His sister, Melanie, as a twenty-four-year-old woman, stands in the doorway adorned in bloody, scorched Marine battle fatigues. Her body shows signs of burns, sores, and shrapnel injuries. “You are the horniest little thirteen-year-old kid, ever. Since you enjoy legs and feet so much, catch.” She tosses her severed leg at him. “Empusa loaned me her donkey leg. Jerk to your heart’s content.”
The catch knocks the younger Jonathan off balance. He falls into a wall-framed photograph of an eighteen-year-old Melanie and his thirteen-year-old self. A gold metal drapes over Melanie’s Hopkins Prep School swimsuit; Jonathan wears a Hopkins school uniform. The photograph’s glass shatters.
As the younger Jonathan reaches down for the photo . . . he, instead, picks up a shattered, framed photograph of a twenty-four-year-old Melanie adorned in her Marine dress uniform; she hugs an eighteen-year-old Jonathan in his University of Strasbourg, Alsace, France, sweatshirt.
He nicks his finger on a glass shard. He contemplates the blood . . . then paints his lips with his finger tip and laps the blood in ecstasy.

Adult Jonathan shocks awake at his reflection in the family room window, then focuses on the still waters of an empty Olympic swimming pool. The soulful beat of “Who Will Pay Reparations for My Soul” by Gil Scott Heron plays in the background.

As Jonathan clutches his gold eagle-headed walking stick, he limps on his right leg down a hallway.
“Excuse me, sir,” says Charles as he exits the doorway to the Kinski’s master bedroom. “I prepared Mrs. Kinski’s medications for you.”
Jonathan looks at Charles as to ask: “Medications?” As Charles walks off, Jonathan follows the sounds of sexual intercourse beyond the doorway.
Inside, he sees himself and Barbara Kinski engaged in sexual intercourse on a large, wall-mounted plasma screen television.
“Ah, the skills of a dancer’s body,” says a bed-ridden Barbara Kinski. She turns off the remote. “We were quite the devilish couple.”
“And we still are,” replies Jonathan as he limps toward her.
“It hurts me so to see you alone,” says Barbara, unable to feel the joy of Jonathan’s touch on her flesh.
“I’m not alone.” Jonathan dispenses the syringe from the medical tray on the night stand into her arm.
“You know what I mean,” replies Barbara. “It must be painful to have a beautiful girl like Elizabeth in the house—.”
Two medium-sized, passerine-perching songbirds that squawk and ruffle their feathers in an expansive bird cage distract Barbara’s thought. “Could you please cover Harlequin and Columbine, Jonathan?”
“‘If pretty girls could fly like birds,’” says Jonathan as he adjusts the cage’s cover, “as Tchaikovsky said in Queen of Spades.”
“And I’m the Queen, locked away,” replies Barbara. “My youth and happiness swallowed whole in this hardening body.”
Jonathan takes a place on the bed’s edge and strokes the cold smoothness of Barbara’s cheek as he quotes the Italian Statesman Lorenzo de Medici: “‘How beautiful is youth that is always slipping away. Whoever wants to be happy, let him be so; of tomorrow there’s no knowing.’”
“de Medici can go to hell. And I want you to be happy. I don’t want you locking yourself away in your lab anymore.”
“I am happy, Barbara,” says Jonathan as he clutches her frail hand and strokes her stony flesh. “I enjoy my research. I can beat this.”
Barbara dismisses him. “I want you to do what we—.”
“Barbara, I don’t love Elizabeth.”
“And you love me.”
“Yes. I do, Barbara.”
“You think I believe tha—.” As Jonathan attempts to cradle Barbara to comfort her coughing fit; she weakly bats him away. “We are just the other’s expensive playtoy.” She places her hand on a folder on the nightstand. “Sign the divorce papers, Jonathan. Live.”
Jonathan looks towards the folder—and sees a framed, wedding day photograph with Elizabeth. He picks up the photo.
Then he looks back onto a neatly made bed. Barbara is gone.
As Jonathan hugs his wedding day photograph with Elizabeth, he clutches the gold eagle-headed walking stick and exits the master bedroom.
As he enters Elizabeth’s old calligraphy studio, he rests the wedding photograph on her worktable. He walks over to and opens the lid on a double comb, oak-styled Regina Music Box manufactured in the 1800s, set atop an antique wood-and-glass display case. The 15 1/2-inch brass music disc tinkles the sounds of Tchaikovsky’s “Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy.” As the music spins, Jonathan observes Elizabeth’s works that decorate the studio shelves and walls. Then he notices the copy of Nikolai Gogol’s Dead Souls. A chill washes over that inspires him to turn his gaze to the wall-mounted Wilhelm Schroter blue-gravestone rubbing; his stare concentrates on its encircled gothic cross medallion.
As the music box slows to the final measures of the Sugar Plum Fairy’s dance, he gazes out the window—once again onto the reflections of the Olympic-swimming pool waters.

Sunny, blue skies and trees reflect across the waters of Lake Zoar in Oxford, Connecticut.
A thirteen-year-old Jonathan runs into view along the shoreline. He clutches a woman’s boat shoe. An eighteen-year-old Melanie runs into view as she clutches her other boat shoe, in barefoot pursuit.
“Come back here, Johnny. You little stinker,” calls out Melanie.
“I don’t stink. You’re the Smelly Melly. Stinky shoes. Stinky shoes,” Jonathan shouts back to Melanie as he passes a large boulder on the shoreline and scares off two white doves. Melanie stops and sits on the soggy ground, against the boulder. Behind Melanie stands an exquisite, two-story, two-acre chateau, sixteen miles outside of New Haven.
Then, an eighteen-year-old Jonathan approaches and sits down at the boulder—next to a now twenty-four-year-old Melanie.
“We had great summers on this lake, Johnny.”
“And we’ll have more of them, Melly Belly,” says Jonathan as he pokes her firm stomach.
“I can’t get used to this stupid phantom leg itch and cramps.” She raps at her prosthetic leg propped against the boulder. “And I hate this stupid donkey, cloven hoof. I miss guys checking out my legs. I miss swimming, and track, and ballet.” She rubs her left leg, above-the-knee amputation. “And to top it all off, my military career is over.”
“You’re a hero, Melanie.”
“Why, because I got my leg blown off?”
“Because you followed your dreams.”
“Degrees in Medicine and Philosophy at your age isn’t a bad deal, Johnny.”
“True. Our family’s prestige gave me things.” Jonathan contemplates. “But it also forced me to lock away passions that didn’t agree with my pedigree.”
“He’s dead. He can’t say anything about it. Go off and play jazz. Why not go to seminary?”
“The priesthood doesn’t need my dead soul. Besides, I’m marrying Barbara. I’ve already built her a . . . .”
“A dance studio.” Melanie rubs Jonathan’s arm. “It’s alright, Johnny.”
“Come live with us, Mel.”
“Oh, no. No way. I’m not giving Dad the satisfaction of crawling back into that Greenwich haunted house.”

A single gunshot rings out.

*   *

Adult Jonathan refocuses; the waters of Lake Zoar morph into the Olympic-swimming pool waters on the Kinski Estate. He strokes the grains of the Regina Music Box and stares into the emptiness of Elizabeth’s calligraphy studio.
Outside, a maroon BMW parks in the driveway of the Kinski estate. A twenty-five-year-old Allison Tisdell exits.
As Jonathan fans through the pages of Nikolai Gogol’s Dead Souls, the exterior, private business entrance door to the studio opens. Jonathan places down the novel.
“Is this a bad time, Jonathan?” asks Allison.
“No, it’s fine.”
“How’s your leg?”
“Like brass. I’ll be off this cane completely in a few days.” Jonathan uses his free arm to hug Allison.
At first, Allison reciprocates Jonathan’s embrace, then backs away. “No, I can’t. Not anymore,” says Allison to Jonathan’s displeasure. “God forgive me, but I wonder what would have been, if I—. She was my best friend since prep school.” Allison notices Jonathan rhythmic taps of his walking stick. “We were sorority sisters. We danced together. I betrayed her trust.”
“You can’t betray someone, if they don’t know, Allison.”
“I know, Jonathan. I know.”
“Well,” Jonathan sighs, “you were Beth’s business partner, so everything in the studio is yours.”
Allison purses her lips and takes a deep breath to hold her emotions.
“I’ll have Charles arrange for a new studio space. I want you, and all of this, out of here,” says Jonathan to Allison’s confusion. “Including this.” As he looks out the window onto the estate, he shoves the copy of Dead Souls across the table. “It’s the last thing Beth was working on before she died.”
“She was restoring these volumes for my Aunt Bee-Bee.”
The pet-name resonates with Jonathan. He turns his attention to Allison. “As in ‘Bianka.’”
“Yes,” says a puzzled Allison.
“Your Aunt,” as Jonathan’s grip tightens over the gold eagle’s head of the walking stick, “is Bianka Behrami?”
“Jonathan, what’s so funn—.”
Jonathan raises his walking stick to Allison.
“Wait. Jonathan. No!”
He cracks the walking stick into Allison’s neck. She crumbles to the floor, unconscious. He walks over to and presses the intercom button.
“Yes, sir,” says Charles.
“I need your assistance in the calligraphy studio.” Jonathan inspects Allison’s limp body with the tip of his walking stick. “It is time for you to put away the child, Charles. To become a man and indulge in your ultimate fantasy.”

*   *

On the south side of the main plaza for the Lincoln Center at the David H. Koch Theatre, a banner announces: New York City Ballet Production of Pyotr Tchaikovsky’s The Sleeping Beauty.
In the auditorium, Jonathan sits alone in prime balcony seats. The sound of hard violin strings rise for “Prologue: ‘The Baptism of Princess Aurora,’ No. 3 Pas de six, f. Variation ‘Violente.’” He sighs at the sight of Barbara Kinski.
Adorned in her crimson tutu and white tights, Barbara dances as the fairy, Violente. Then, the violin strings screech to an end; Barbara’s body ossifies into porcelain. She tips over and her body shatters into pieces of doll parts across the stage. The staid, glass eyes of her doll head replica, close.

*   *
*

In his library study, Jonathan plays Giuseppe Domenico Scarlatti’s “Sonata in D Minor, K517” on the harpsichord. He gazes at two, wall-framed oil-painted wedding portraits with Barbara and Elizabeth. He pounds the keys into cacophony.
As he clutches his walking stick, he pours a snifter of brandy. He turns his attentions to the Darmstadt Trunk. He walks over, opens the lid, and removes a bound journal. As he thumbs the journal, a page with a memento mori skull illustration atop a piece of sheet music entitled “Es Fui Sum Eris” catches his eye.
Jonathan returns a seat at the harpsichord. As he reads and plays the music, a panting, overhead, unseen presence—observes. He sings the lyrics—

“All soul comes willingly
To this sign of morality
And the same conclusion.
Regardless of the journey
And destination chosen,
Our souls are all the same.”

to the irritation of the presence, which swoops to the library’s closed door. Blood sweeps from under the threshold.
In the hallway, blood bubbles and soaks the carpet. Something forms. Something begins to grow, rising from the blood and fabric fibers.
As Jonathan plays the harpsichord, a hazy, ghostly choir of Barbara, Elizabeth, and Melanie join in—

“Thou memento mori bearer, ye
Soul bestowed raison d’etre,
Ye receiver shall not resist.
Ye must strive to be the best
And vanquish the evil guilt,
As each day is the last.
Sweet, Morgana le Fay,
Es Fui Sum Eris.
As you are, so once was I.
Sweet, Morgana le Fay,
Es Fui Sum Eris.
As you are, so once—.”

A knock on the library door silences the song to a close. “Go away, Charles. Not now!” calls out Jonathan.
As Jonathan turns to the door, he notices a blood puddle at the threshold. His shoes squish into the carpet. He opens the door to reveal—
Barbara Kinksi.
In her dancer’s prime, she stands adorned as the Fairy Violente from Tchaikovsky’s The Sleeping Beauty, with a tiara on a hair bun, a crimson tutu, white tights, and pink leather split-sole shoes. She rubs her outer thighs; blood pours from under the tutu and saturates the tights.
“Barbara? Barbara!” says Jonathan as he attempts to hug her.
Instead, she begins to run her hands over her body as she quotes from “Holy Sonnet #1,” one of Jonathan’s most beloved sonnets, by the poet, John Donne:

“‘Thou hast made me, and shall thy work decay?
Repair me now, for now, mine end doth haste;’”

She reaches out, embraces Jonathan, and continues,

“‘I run to death, and death meets me fast,
And all my pleasures are like yesterday.’”

As Jonathan reciprocates Barbara’s hug, he pulls away a clump of hair and skull from the head of—
“Jonathan. Help me, Jonathan. I don’t want to be dead,” cries out Elizabeth who now stands before him, in his arms. “My flesh hurts so bad. Make the pain go away.”
Jonathan shocks awake at the open library door. His open arms—unfilled. The carpet beneath his feet: clean. Barbara and Elizabeth: gone.

Ana curls in the bed of her maid quarters. She clutches and strokes Elizabeth’s framed photograph. She startles to a door creak.
Jonathan enters; adorned in lounging pajamas—with no walking stick and a strong leg. He clutches a chardonnay bottle and two glasses. He pours. Ana sips; he gulps. He shoves Ana onto the bed. Both chardonnay glasses shatter; the wine splatters into a five-petalled floral pattern—a dog rose.
“Jonathan, wait. What are you—?” A cloth jammed over her mouth and nose silences her.

At center floor of the dance studio on the Kinski Estate, sits the kneeling, rear view of two women dressed as ballerinas, their hair pulled back in buns, bound side-by-side in bondage stockades. One of the women, aware—whimpers.
Jonathan and Charles sit before them; a wine tasting table set between the chairs. A Bose Music Center sits on the table next to a merlot bottle. They drink.
Ana awakes to the sounds of Allison’s gagged whimpers.
Allison wears a pink ballet body suit, white tights, and pink leather split-sole ballet shoes; back pinned against the spine of the stockade. Shackles secure her wrists behind, to the main spine. Shackles on her ankles lead to chains into the corners of the base. A metal collar immobilizes her neck to the stockade spine.
Ana then realizes her own, similar costume and bondage.
Jonathan taps the play button on the music center. The “Second Suite, Act II: ‘Adagio from the Grand pas de Deux’” of The Nutcracker fills the room. He takes a colder, clinical view of his boxed dolls.
Charles, however, salivates in ignorant oblivion over the delights contained before him.
Jonathan sighs at the sight of Barbara and Elizabeth, who dance a series of echappees-on-point, fouette turns, pas de chots, and pirouettes around an oblivious Ana and Allison. “Shortly before Tchaikovsky began composing The Nutcracker ballet,” says Jonathan, “his sister perished. But from her death, he found beauty.”
Ana and Allison can only respond with cries into their pink leather muzzles.
“For Tchaikovsky found an inspiration to preserve his sister’s memory, by composing a melancholy, descending scale melody for this adagio of the ‘Grand pas de Deux.’”
Jonathan’s insights are lost on Charles, adrift in the darkness of his fantasies; unaware to the ghostly dance of Barbara and Elizabeth.
“My Barbara and Elizabeth moved hearts to tears when they graced the stage for the New York City Ballet.” Jonathan sighs in delight at their dance. “And I, like Tchaikovsky, shall use my gifts to my best abilities, so no one shall suffer my heartbreak.” Jonathan then turns to Charles. “Charles, could you please explain to the ladies what an endocrinologist is?”
Without breaking away from the indulgence of his eyes, Charles clarifies: “A doctor well-versed in the glands and the internal secretions of the human body.”
“At least you know from whence your ‘cum’ comes from, Charles,” says Jonathan as he rises from his chair and strokes Charles’s chin.
Charles looks up with soft eyes at Jonathan and exhales a deep, orgasmic sigh in delight.
“You see, ladies,” says Jonathan as he approaches and clutches Allison’s throat above her collar, “the missing ingredients are fear, pain, and stress; these mental and physical reactions are the exciters, the key to stimulating the body’s fight-or-flight responses.”
He turns his attentions to Ana; he squeezes her nostrils shut; her chest and throat spasm for air.
“These exciters circulate bodily fluids out of the adrenal gland, activate the pituitary gland to excrete endorphins, and excite neurohormones from the hypothalamus into the blood stream.”
Charles gulps from a wine glass as he rubs his crouch to fulfillment.
“And inside you, Ana and Allison,” declares Jonathan, “are the final ingredients; the key constituents I require to cure to Barbara’s Fibrodysplasia and deliver Elizabeth from an afterlife of pain and suffering.”
Jonathan turns his attentions to Charles; he strokes his valet’s cheek and cradles the chin. Charles smiles upward with soft, loving eyes at his master.
“Remember, Charles. Our two bloods, mingled be. Play nice. Inspire their exciters, within reason,” instructs Jonathan. He gulps the last of the merlot and leaves the dance studio.
And the presence of Barbara and Elizabeth vanish from sight.

In the driveway of the Kinski Estate, an overcoat adorned, sixty-year-old Father Edward Pertorksi exits the driver’s side door of a sedan.
In a lair of oak paneling, stuffed bookshelves, and antique displays of the billiards room, Jonathan swigs a snifter of Cognac. He shoots at balls on a red felt table.
His leg: completely healed.
“Sorry to disturb you, sir,” says Charles as he enters the room. “Father Pertorski to see you.”
“Send him in, Charles.”
The Father’s entrance brings a glow to Jonathan’s face. “It’s good to see you,” as he shakes the Father’s hand. “It has been a while, Father Ed.”
“I appreciate you seeing me, unannounced. Am I interrupting?”
“Not at all, Father. Just knocking balls around,” says Jonathan as he passes a cue stick. “You’re solids.”
“No cane. Leg strong as brass,” says Father Ed.
“Physician hell thy self.” Jonathan approaches the bar. “Can I interest you in a well-aged scotch, Father?”
“A cognac, please.” Father Ed takes notice of a framed reproduction of a man adorned in a red headdress and sash on the wall. “That’s a new one. Is that a long-lost relative from Bucharest?”
“That would be the 15th century Italian statesman and patron of the arts, Lorenzo de Medici.” Jonathan hands a snifter to Father Ed. “We wouldn’t have had a Da Vinci or Michelangelo without him. He’s noted for coining the phase, ‘Too much knowing is misery.’”
Father Ed seems to lose his place in the world.
“Your shot, Father,” says Jonathan.
“Oh, yes. Right. Of course.”
“So what brings you by, Father?” says Jonathan as the Father’s shot misses the pocket.
“One of my parishioners passed away,” Father Ed replies as Jonathan takes a shot and the balls sinks the pocket. “It’s been a time since Elizabeth’s funeral, so I stopped by your office. You also quit your teaching tenure at Yale as well.”
“I’m pursuing private research.”
Father Ed takes another shot; he misses—again. “Jonathan, God didn’t intend the grieving to mourn forever.”
Jonathan takes a hard, vengeful shot. The ball slams into the pocket. “But he intended man to see Satan as the bad guy. The one being who represents knowledge and freedom of authority is the bad man?”
“I didn’t come here for a misotheist debate, Jonathan. I wanted to—.”
“I wanted to serve God, but he abandoned me. Now,” says Jonathan as he raises his hands to the room, “I serve myself. This is my temple. I am my own Faust and Mephisto. And when it comes to worshipping . . . I choose me.”
“Jonathan, faith tells us—.”
“Faith is metaphor marketed as literal, historical fact for the spiritually weak and the ignorant of heart.”
“And Satan is truth?”
“Lucifer is nothing but metaphor, Father. Only without the collared spin doctors.”
“So your creed isn’t ‘Do unto others,’ it’s—.”
“‘Do as thou whilst,’ and I will accomplish what God cannot.”
“Which is what, Jonathan?”
“An innovative era in biology where necrocytosis never sets in. Where abnormal cell growth is corrected,” replies Jonathan as he picks up and studies the white cue ball, “damaged cells regenerate, and dead cells reanimate. Cells,” as he slams the cue ball into the table’s felt, “with an everlasting stability.”
“Jonathan,” says Father Ed, caught off-guard by the sudden slam of the cue ball, “if you could sum the Holy Bible’s message in one word—.”
“I haven’t opened a bible in years, Father. Besides, you know my answer.”
“It’s freewill, Jonathan,” says Father Ed as Jonathan re-racks the billiard balls. “From the book of Genesis to Revelation are parables of man misusing God’s greatest gift to commit the ultimate sin, which is using their freewill to impede the autonomy of others.” Jonathan digs the cue stick into the chalk as Father Ed continues. “God didn’t afflict Barbara in punishment, nor did He allow the devil to use her anatomy against you.”
Jonathan responds with the draw of his cue. He shoots—the 9-Ball sinks on the break.
“Jonathan, why would He gift freewill, only to become a sadist and murder a gifted woman like Elizabeth?”
“And prosthetics,” says Jonathan, “for some, is no way to restore a limb. What Melanie needed,” as he jams the cue stick into the cue ball, “was a prosthetic for the soul.” The ball misses the pocket. “And God created none.”
“The one principle medical science doesn’t teach is that man isn’t a grouping of cells inhabited by a spirit,” says Father Ed as Jonathan picks up and fingers the 8-Ball. “We’re spiritual creatures existing in vessels of flesh. It is what permits our true essence to thrive in this three-dimensional world against Satan’s flesh-driven temptations.”
“In every tragedy, there are innocent victims, Father Ed.”
“You are not victim. God isn’t a victimizer—.”
“And with God as my witness,” says Jonathan as he shakes the 8-Ball at Father Ed, “I will crack open your skull so you know how it felt when Elizabeth died.”
In shock and embarrassment, Father Ed begins to leave. “If you excuse me, Jonathan.”
“Too much knowing is misery, Father Ed. And know, you know.”
As Father Ed enters the foyer, the sight of the Nephilim of a Daniel Chester French sculpture reproduction in the center of the entrance inflicts uneasiness upon Father Ed’s soul. The foyer begins to distort in his sight. He stares at the twisted visions of the three William-Adolphe Bouguereau reproduction paintings of Nephilim that adorn the walls. Then, the carved owl perched atop the mahogany Grandmother Clock glares downward at him. The clock chimes—
“Excuse me, sir,” a dissonant voice calls out. I can’t allow you to leave.”
Father Ed catches his stagger on a table.
“Sir, are you alright?” says Charles.
“Yes. Yes, I’m fine, Charles. Just an old man having one of his spells.”
“Would you like some water, sir?” asks Charles as he assists the Father with his overcoat.
“No. Don’t trouble yourself. God bless you, Charles.”
“And you as well, Father Pertorski.”
In the driveway of the Kinski Estate, Father Ed stares back at the house. Then he shocks at the sight of a dozen hooting owls perched in the trees, staring down at him with an evil intent.
He rushes to his car. The sedan speeds off.

9

CHARLES chauffeurs Jonathan in a black Audi sedan. The Chambers Brothers’ 1969 cover of the Bee Gees’ 1967 hit, “To Love Somebody,” plays over the sound system.
The sedan parks at the entrance to the Sacred Heart Parish, a historic brick structure on Henry Street in Greenwich, Connecticut. Jonathan exits the sedan and approaches the doors.
In the vestibule narthex, he caresses the wing of a marble angel stoup. He taps his finger on the holy water’s surface and rubs it on his thumb. His mind drifts into the ripples.

*   *

Inside the Parish’s sacristy, a thirteen-year-old Jonathan, cloaked in a red alb and white chasuble, cleans two cruets in the sink; he fills one with water; the other, wine.
Older Jonathan stands in the corner; as he watches his memory unfold, he notices a forty-three-year-old Father Ed enter the sacristy.
“Jonathan,” says Young Father Ed to Young Jonathan, lost in his thoughts. “Johnny?”
Young Jonathan wipes tears and turns to Young Father Ed’s touch of the shoulder. “Forgive me, Father. My faith isn’t as strong as I had hoped.”
“I will miss you, Johnny,” says Young Father Ed as Young Jonathan gathers the Father’s liturgical vestments of a white alb and red chasuble to assist in his dress.
“I know His gifting of Yale is the destiny He planned, but—.”
“Jonathan, you don’t need to be in a box of wood and stone to be with God.” Young Father Ed presses his finger into Jonathan’s chest. “Your body is the true church.”
Before Young Jonathan can reply—
“And my adulthood is textbook ‘affect-effect,’ the fallout of childhood traumas from this sacred box, and my loving home, right Father Ed,” interjects Older Jonathan from the corner of the room.
Young Father Ed turns his attentions back to Young Jonathan. “I know you had dreams about serving the Lord, but—.”
“Dreams are a subconscious biology that renews and restores, Father,” says Young Jonathan. “Dreams help us find resilience against the events that caused disturbances and damage to our lives.”
“Please, spare us the lecture about Freud’s theory that ‘No dream is just dream,’ kid,” Older Jonathan chastises to his younger self.
“The past isn’t merely a source of psychological neurosis,” says Young Father Ed to Older Jonathan. “It’s a source of freedom and liberation. A healthy individual can break out of their box and find redemption through acceptance.”
“And speaking of ‘liberation,’” says Older Jonathan in reply to Young Father Ed, “I should have done this long ago.” To the shock of Young Jonathan, Older Jonathan clutches Young Father Ed by the vestments and thrusts his hand into the Father’s stomach—and rips out his liver.
Young Jonathan rushes to Young Father Ed collapsed on the floor; he twitches in pain.
As Older Jonathan dumps the cruets, he says to his younger self, “Remember when we read Robert Thompson and James V. McConnell’s studies on the chemical transferences of memories through cannibalism?”
“Yes,” says Young Jonathan as his older self squeezes the blood from Father Ed’s liver into the cruets. “And we realized all creatures are ritualistic, biomechanical engines gratifying basic needs with no other ambition or aim, which serve only to prolong one’s poor life.”
Older Jonathan passes a bloody cruet to his younger self; he gulps from the other cruet. “Ahh. Better than that swill they pass off as the blood of Christ.” Then he bites off a hunk from the liver. “Better than those bland wafers they pass off as his flesh,” says Older Jonathan as he smacks his lips in delight.
“I know flesh and organs served as medical ingredients since history began,” says Young Jonathan, “but—.”
“Kid, there is nothing immoral about a culture’s desire to survive the devastations of God’s four mythical equestrians by trading and cooking their children.” Older Jonathan holds the liver to the lips of his younger self. “It’s better raw, from the source.”
Young Jonathan grimaces.
“Why waste time in seminary, when you can learn it all in one bite. Screw that bitch Eve and her damned apple.”
“Na-nooo, Jon-ath-an. No-oo!” cries Young Father Ed from the floor in a pool of blood.

“Jonathan. Are you alright?” asks Older Father Ed.

As Adult Jonathan stumbles into the stoup, he finds himself back in the vestibule narthex. Father Ed catches his fall.
“Should I call someone, Jonathan?”
“It seems my body is rejecting the brass leg Empusa gave me.”
“Why don’t we go to my office? Ms. Buff would love to see you. I’ll have her make tea,” says Father Ed as he assists Jonathan.
“I wanted to apologize for my abhorrent behavior during your visit at my home, Father. I was filled with drink and melancholy.”
“I should have called first.”
“I’ll have Charles check my schedule, so we can shoot a more friendly game.”
“I would enjoy that, Jonathan.”
Jonathan holds a slip of paper in his hands. “I wanted to deliver this, personally.”
“After my visit, and the direct deposit not arriving, I assumed—.”
“My family financially and spiritually supported this parish, as will I.”
“You’re under no obligation to your family’s traditions, Jonathan.”
“You were more than a priest to my parents and grandparents. Barbara and Elizabeth considered you their friend, as do I,” says Jonathan as he places the check into and cups Father Ed’s hands. “Well, Charles is outside with the car. Please give Ms. Buff my warmest regards.”
“Of course. Bless you, Jonathan.”
Jonathan walks away without a response to the blessing.
Father Ed’s body shivers and he rubs the cold from his hands. He fails to notice the pentagram necklace—and not a check—in his palms.

Behind the desk in his office, Father Ed fans through a bible’s pages. As he writes a sermon in longhand on a legal pad, he calls out, “Come in, Ms. Buff,” to a door knock that causes him to peer over his glasses. As the door opens, Father Ed shocks—
“Mephistopheles isn’t an agent who seeks man’s downfall, Father,” speaks Barbara Kinski, who stands before him in the hallway.
Before Father Ed can process the words spoken by Barbara, he instead sees—
“He embodies clarity and energy,” spoken by Elizabeth Kinski.
“No. No. It’s not possible,” shivers Father Ed.
“Perhaps this form,” says Bianka, “is more appealing to your eye,” who now stands in Elizabeth’s place.
Father Ed sits in fear.
“What is it you drone on about in your sermons,” says Bianka, as she slinks towards his desk, “that ‘with God, all things are possible’?”
Ecstasy washes over Father Ed at the stroke of Bianka’s well-manicured fingernail under his chin.
“Well, many things are possible without him, Eddie. And now, you know.”
Father Ed sits in silence, mesmerized by Bianka’s reflective, green eyes.
“Yes. Exactly. We are not a myth.” Bianka slowly unbuttons her blouse to expose her breasts. “I’m sure you’ve confessed about these in your little booth.” Father Ed’s chair creaks backwards as Bianka straddles him; he nods.
Father Ed’s hands quake as he reaches outward.
“Jonathan is involved in very important work for my father,” says Bianka as Father Ed’s hands begin to massage her chest. She rolls her neck in pleasure. “And your offensive beguilements are no longer required.”
Father Ed’s eyes widen; he begins a deeper massage of Bianka’s breasts.
“Being a student of this ridiculous collar,” says Bianka as she runs her fingertips around his neck, “I’m sure you’ve heard of ‘Prometheus,’ Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s poem.”
As she cradles Father Ed’s face, he nods in agreement. They quote the poem in unison:

“‘Why shall anyone honor him? What for?
Has he softened the pains,
Ever, of a burdened one?
Has he silenced the tears,
Ever, of an anguished one?’”

Bianka pulls down the zipper of Father Ed’s trousers. “Now, let’s relieve you . . . of your tears . . . and anguish.”
Ecstasy rips across Father Ed’s body; then wide-eyed fear envelops him. He climaxes.
Outside of the Sacred Heart Parish, Jonathan’s Audi Sedan drives away. Father’s Ed’s unheard screams echo from the building—and fall upon silent ears.

RUDY Tomlinson, a forty-something detective, exits his parked, unmarked police sedan in the driveway of the Kinski Estate. He becomes unnerved at the sight of a dozen owls perched in observance. Their eyes tighten as he approaches the front door.
Instead of Charles attending to his duties, Bianka responds to Tomlinson’s door knock.
He replies with a silent stare into her reflective, green eyes.
Bianka strokes his cheek and quotes the first verse of the sixth chapter of Genesis. “‘And it came to pass,’” as she massages the front of his trousers, “‘when man began to multiply on the face of the earth,’” and tightly squeezes, “‘and daughters were born unto them.’”
Blood soaks Tomlinson’s trousers. He jerks back in shock—
Bianka arches her brow, in question, as Tomlinson stands dumbfounded in the doorway. “I, uh, I’m,” as he fumbles for his credentials, “Detective Rudy Tomlinson. I’d like to speak with Doctor Kinski, please, ma’am.”
“Jonathan is in the midst of sensitive research and can’t be disturbed.”
“Are you the maid Ana Nicols?”
Bianka responses with a smirk as Tomlinson fumbles with his notebook.
“Uh, sorry ma’am. Allison Tisdell?”
“A friend and colleague. Doctor Bianka Behrami,” says Bianka as she extends her hand to Tomlinson. “I board with the Kinski’s when visiting America. Please, do come in.” Tomlinson takes her hand. Instead of a sociable shake, his motionless arm serves as a leash in Bianka’s hand.
Once in the foyer, Tomlinson takes notice of the naked, erotic marble Nephilim seducing a woman—a reproduction of 1923 sculpture of The Sons of God Saw the Daughters of Men that they were Fair by Daniel Chester French—that stands at room center. Three William-Adolphe Bougereau Nephilim paintings of “Psyche & Cupid,” 1889, “Cupid & Psyche as Children,” 1890, and “The Abduction of Psyche,” 1895, surround French’s masterpiece.
Mesmerized by the artworks, as was Father Ed, Tomlinson feels woozy.
“Images of the Nephilim’s sexual liaisons with mortal women are intoxicating, aren’t they? It’s said their offspring, the Rephaim, have the most sensual, voracious appetites,” says Bianka.
“Yes. Of course. Uh, could I speak with . . . Charles, then, please, ma’am?”
“You’ve caught us on a bad week, Detective Tomlinson. He’s on-loan, assisting Ms. Tisdell on business in Germany.”
“If I could speak then, with Ana, then, please, if I may, ma’am?”
“She’s on errands for the house. As I said, I’m Doctor Kinski’s intimate confidant.” Bianka hooks the detective’s arm. “Let’s retire to the family room and be more comfortable, Rudolph.”
In the family room, the fire place crackles as Bianka’s slink towards the bar captivates Tomlinson. She mixes two scotches on the rocks. The detective begins to breathe deeply, enthralled by Jonathan’s collection.
“Jonathan’s high-end hoarding is one of his most appealing traits,” says Bianka as she slinks towards the couch with the scotches and coasters. “He has no interest in tin trinkets.” Bianka sits on the couch and slowly crosses her leg. She pops and dangles her heel. “Aw, not drinking, Rudolph?” she teases, with a swizzle stick between her lips. “I watered it down, you being on duty and all. A sociable sip won’t hurt.”
Tomlinson sips. He gazes at her heel dangle.
“You won’t solve your mystery gawking at my anklet, Detective Tomlinson.”
“Uh, yes. I wanted to speak with the Doctor about Father Pertorski. I’m sorry to tell him that the Father died of a heart attack.”
“Oh, how terrible. He and Jonathan enjoyed brandy and cigars over billiards just the other day.”
“Yes. The Father’s secretary said he was here. Were you with them, ma’am?”
“Briefly. But the Father seemed in fine spirits. I had retired to the lab to run some tests.”
“What type of research, if I may ask, please, ma’am?”
“A cure for Fibrodysplasia,” says Bianka to Tomlinson’s baffled look.
“Stone Man Syndrome.” She takes his hand and caresses his flesh. “A rare disease that fuses the human body into a solid mass.”
Tomlinson pulls away. He rubs and stretches his ice-cold hand. “This, uh, was a, in Father Pertorski’s hand when he died.” He shows Bianka an iPhone image of a pentagram necklace. “Did Doctor Kinski give it—.”
Bianka rips the iPhone from Tomlinson’s hand, a hand which offers no resistance. “You think the Father’s death is occult related, because of a trinket? How quaint.” Bianka rises from the couch and slinks toward the fireplace.
Tomlinson, slouched motionless on the couch, inhales a deep breath. He shivers in spite of the warmth that emanates from the roaring fireplace.
“An inverted star is an Egyptian hieroglyph meaning ‘knowledge,’ Detective.” She tosses his iPhone into the fire. “And its five-points represent the synchronized, forty year Venus-Earth orbital cycle: your solar system’s metronome.” Then she takes a Wadokei clock from the fireplace mantle in her hands and winds its clockworks. “And when superimposed on a five-petalled rose, the star symbolizes ‘resurrection,’ Detective.” Bianka steps out of both of her heels.
Tomlinson’s lips quiver.
“Now that we’ve answered all your questions about religious metaphor, Rudolph,” says Bianka as her dress drops from her body, “let’s spend our time productively in front of this warm fire.” Bianka lowers herself and lounges on the rug. “Come Rudolph. Let’s test the weakness of your body’s five meager, little senses.”
Tomlinson removes his blazer and drops to his knees, helpless to Bianka’s beguilements. Bianka pulls open and pops the buttons off his dress shirt.
“Well, of course you can put my ‘fuck me’ pumps back on,” says Bianka as she massages her feet into his crouch. Tomlinson cradles her feet as Bianka hands him each of her heels; he slips them on. Bianka swings her legs back and leans into him; she unbuckles his belt. “My bad, little Faust wants him Empusa.”
Tomlinson, his mouth agape and eyes groggy, nods in the positive.
Bianka extracts the belt from its trouser loops, folds and snaps the black leather, then shoves Tomlinson backwards onto the rug. Mesmerized, his arms opened in a crucifixion-like pose, Bianka rips down his pants.
Tomlinson turns his head toward the fireplace. The fire roars hotter, higher; his eyes widen as he stares deeper into the flames.
Mounted on Tomlinson, Bianka flings her black mane and arches her back as she bounces up and down on his waist.
As he turns his stare from the fire back to Bianka, his face shocks; unable to find air, at—
Bianka’s right hand morphs into an eagle’s claw.
She thrusts the clawed appendage into his stomach. She rips out his liver and relishes the bloody lump. She bites into the organ. “Mmm. Tastes like eternity.”
Orgasms rip through Tomlinson’s body as Bianka moans in pleasure with each chew.
Cat hiss shrieks—of a nude Barbara and Elizabeth, alongside a silent, one-donkey-legged Melanie, each perched doggy-style on the floor—fill the room; the trio kept at bay on leashed collars clutched by Fritz.
“Time for leftovers, pets,” says Fritz. He drops the leashes.
Barbara, Elizabeth, and Melanie leap and pounce on Tomlinson.

Outside, Tomlinson’s screams echo across the Kinski Estate—onto deaf ears.

The Greenwich Boat and Yacht Club sits in the eastern distance. Tomlinson’s unmarked sedan travels along Shore Road, southbound through Grass Island along Greenwich Harbor.
Tomlinson startles awake. His body jerks behind the wheel—
An eagle swoops into the windshield. Its claws puncture and shatter the glass.
The car skids out of control.

A twisted, yellow diamond Right Turn Sign lies on the asphalt. The sign leads to skid marks, then onto torn away grass and busted tree limbs, then onto the overturned wreckage of a sedan. Tomlinson’s body stands upright, impaled on a road sign post through his stomach—where his liver should be. His eyes remain wide open, condemned to see his death, forever.

ANA’S eyes shock open.
Inside the morgue of the Kinski Estate, her view focuses on a body transport trolley, then onto a four-drawer morgue freezer. The upper drawers have illegible I.D plates. The two lower drawers have no I.D plates.
Her eyes go wild.
She then focuses on three computer monitors that display 3D animations for Diencephalon, with a color-coded Thalamus System of the brain; a rotating human skull with a visible brain and Hypothalamus Gland; and a chemical model of Epinephrine. She also sees two large, dry erase boards with illustrations for the chemical synthesis of Epinephrine and the biosynthesis of Adrenaline and Enzymatic Reactions.
Ana’s eyes go wild.
On an adjacent stretcher, Ana sees Allison supined in four-point medical restraints; her right arm strapped at waist level and her left arm strapped at head level; her head inclined at a thirty degree angle. A pink leather muzzle encases her jaw. A series of catheters and wires attached to Allison’s body correspond to the female Endocrine Glandular System.
Ana then comes to realize her own, similar bondage and medical preparation. Catheters from both of their bodies lead into an embalming unit between them. They both come to notice the two empty stretchers on either side of them. Then they stare back at the four-draw morgue freezer—with its two occupied and two unoccupied drawers.
Unknown to them is the observation room—an empty, padded 10-foot by 10-foot cell, with one wall constructed of floor-to-ceiling glass, itself concealed by an outside wall with a visible split down the middle—that stands off of and isolated from the morgue.

A red bulb illuminates over the main entrance door to the morgue. Hydraulics hiss; the door slides open. Jonathan and Charles, adorned in lab coats, exit the main clinical research laboratory, into the morgue. Jonathan ignores Ana and Allison. He takes a seat at a computer station and reviews data.
Charles clutches two engraved I.D plates. “Hot off the presses,” Charles advises Ana and Allison, “so you know where you’ll be staying.”
“This isn’t a charity mixer, Charles. We have work to do,” scolds Jonathan.
“Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.” Charles caresses the I.D plates on the upper drawers for “Barbara Kinski” and “Elizabeth Kinski.” He adheres the I.D plates to the drawers for “Ana Nicols” and “Allison Tisdell.” He pulls open the drawer to expose Barbara Kinski’s ossified body. He caresses the metal slab and her porcelain skin. Ecstasy washes over his face—
A syringe plunges into his neck.
“I’m not running a necrophilia dating service, either,” says Jonathan. He places Charles onto a body transport trolley, then leans over and kisses Barbara’s stone lips. He pushes the drawer closed.
Ana and Allison have no recourse but to scream unheard into their muzzles.

The privacy screen splits open to expose the view of the observation room into the morgue. Cowered on the floor in a fetal position, sores and scales cover Charles’ body. He screams unheard, behind the soundproof glass.
Oblivious to Charles’ cries, Jonathan caresses Ana’s flesh. “I haven’t decided if you’re better whole, or in pieces. Elizabeth does love her dolls, after all.” Jonathan turns his attention to Allison. “Not to worry, Ally. Barbara adored you both, equally. She’ll be glad to see you both, again.”
Elizabeth’s corpse—with the remnants of a skull operation and a once beautiful mane—lies on the stretcher next to Allison. Barbara’s ossified body lies on the stretcher next to Ana.
Charles now stands and pounds on the soundproof transparency as he screams in silence. The fist blows leave trails of body fluids smears across the glass partition.
“Can you hear me in there, Charles,” says Jonathan into a handheld remote control unit.
Charles’ voice cracks over the morgue’s speakers. “What did you do to me?”
“Just shots of Krokodil. My own recipe.”
Charles’ body wretches in pain. He vomits.
“That’s the agony of your flesh rotting into gangrene.”
“I thought we were brothers, Jonathan.”
“Nothing personal, Charles.” Jonathan runs his finger on the blood smeared glass. He licks his finger, as if his valet’s blood was on his finger. He licks his lips. “Our two bloods, still, mingled be.”
“You bast—.” Jonathan cuts off the sound system.
“Not to worry, Charles. The endocrine systems of these two ladies will regenerate your flesh, and reanimate Barbara and Elizabeth. Barbara’s skin will be as soft as the day she was born.”
Jonathan presses the remote; the “Second Suite, Act II: ‘Adagio from the Grand pas de Deux’” from The Nutcracker fills the room. “I conducted childhood experiments under microscopes with hydras and planarian flatworms,” says Jonathan, as he begins his lecture.
In Jonathan’s childhood bedroom on the Kinski Estate, a six-year-old Jonathan hunches over a microscope with a scalpel. Adult Jonathan, in his lab wears, stands in the corner.
“Hydras do not age, nor die of old age. Planarian flatworms reign immortal under a scalpel,” says Adult Jonathan.
As he places his hand on the shoulder of his younger self, his younger self draws a blade across and bisects a protozoan seen under the scope’s optics.
“Once wounded, a protozoan activates regenerative properties,” continues Adult Jonathan as the protozoan morphs into two organisms under the microscopic slide, “properties rivaling humans. Each is resilient to natural fluctuations or violent events that inflict damage.”
Adult Jonathan now stands next to a 1787 portrait by Angelica Kauffman of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, at the age of 38, set on the wall of Jonathan’s teenaged bedroom. He observes his thirteen-year-old self, adorned in a Yale sweatshirt, as he studies an anatomy textbook. Teenaged Jonathan places the book down and rubs his eyes, then picks up a pair of tweezers and removes winged ants from an acrylic bug box; he feeds the bugs to two pairs of newts and salamanders in separate terrarium habitats.
“More amazing,” says Adult Jonathan, “are the Caudata, the order of tailed amphibians and vertebrate group.”
In the morgue, Jonathan continues his lecture. “They are capable of regenerating limbs, tails, jaws, and eyes, along with internal tissues.” The morgue lights dim. A theatre screen lowers from the ceiling. “And this brings us to our presentation regarding your individual contributions.”
Jonathan taps the keyboard.
Fluids begin to extract via the catheters from Ana and Allison. All they can do is whimper in fear at the theatre screen.
Charles stands inside and leans on the transparent wall of his glass womb; he spits up more bodily fluids that splash across the partition.
The theatre screen displays a title card:

“The Prometheus Project”

The title card’s typeface morphs into a PowerPoint presentation as The Last Supper by Leonardo De Vinci, 1490, appears on the screen.
Jonathan picks up a scalpel. “Man’s fascination with obtaining dominion over his flesh,” says Jonathan as he caresses Ana’s leg with the blade, “began with the man who first conquered it.” He carves a section of flesh from Ana. Ana screams silent whimpers into the pink leather that encases her lower jaw. “To celebrate, the Twelve Apostles consumed the flesh and blood of Jesus Christ.” Jonathan places Ana’s tasty morsel on his tongue—and swallows.
A second image, Crucifixion by Matthias Grunewald, 1510, appears.
“And as Christ had prophesized, he was brutally beaten, then murdered by impalement upon a crucifix. And he resurrected his flesh.”
Then, an image of a 1408 rendering of an ouroboros—a dragon with its tail wound around its neck, and a crucifix on its wing, appears on screen.
“As result of Christ conquering the flesh, the Order of the Dragon,” says Jonathan as he blesses Ana’s forehead, “founded in the year 1408, defended his cross. This ouroboros is their Coat of Arms.”
A fourth image appears: Two side-by-side illustrations of Vlad Tepes: the first, an oil-on-canvas portrait; the second, a woodblock print of Vlad as he dines on a grassy hill, surrounded by stake-impaled bodies.
“One of the proud members of the Order was Vlad the Third, Prince of Wallachia, born in the year 1431,” says Jonathan as he clutches a new scalpel. “The Romanian origin of his name, Vlad Tepes, means ‘Vlad the Impaler’; others referred to him as Vlad Dracul. Then Bram Stoker came along and turned Tepes’ brilliance into a comic book character: Count Dracula.”
Ana and Allison can only scream into their leather gags and buck their bodies against their restraints.
“The Prince found his strength through the bloodshed of up to 100,000 men by way of impalement,” says Jonathan as he plunges the scalpel into Allison’s thigh, then licks the blade, “so as to fill his tubs and goblets for rejuvenational bathing and nutritional refreshment.”
A 16th Century portrait of Elizabeth Bathory appears on the theatre screen.
“This is Countess Elizabeth Bathory of Hungary, born in 1560,” continues Jonathan as he lightly caresses Ana with the scalpel. “The Order’s emblem also served as the Bathory Coat of Arms.” He bends back Ana’s fingers; she winces. “In her just quest for immortality, the Countess drank, bathed, and showered in the blood of 600 young women,” says Jonathan as he turns his attentions to Allison, “leading her to be unjustly labeled as the world’s first female serial killer.”
A sixth screen image appears: a photo of the ruins of Burg Frankenstein.
“Another seeker of truth was Johann Konrad Dippel, born in 1673 at Burg Frankenstein on the Rhine in Darmstadt, Germany.” Jonathan caresses Ana’s hair; then clenches her disheveled locks in his fist and pulls. “Skilled in anatomy and alchemy, he too, sought life’s elixir.” He wipes Ana’s tears with a finger tip and enjoys the taste of her tears. “Through his work with cadavers, he developed the live giving, animal bone-based oil, known as ‘Dippel’s Oil.’”
An oil-painted rendering of Luigi Galvani appears in a split-screen with an ink rendering of an old prison: Newgate.
“Then, in 1771, the Italian physician and philosopher Luigi Galvani stimulated dead flesh with bioelectricity. Tests were completed on the scourge of British society at London’s Newgate Prison.”
An eighth image appears on screen: a pen and ink rendering of Jack the Ripper.
“Then, in 1888, London was plagued by the misunderstood ‘White Chapel Murders,’” says Jonathan as he begins to clench his hand around Allison’s throat. “In reality, Jack the Ripper harvested organs and fluids, not as an act of homicidal, erotic, or,” as he inhales the scent of Allison’s fear on his hand, “religious mania, but as medical research into eternal life.”
A ninth and final images appears on screen: Prometheus Bound by Peter Paul Rubens, 1618.
“And we reach Dante’s ninth circle with our lecture’s inspiration. This is Prometheus, the Greek Titan responsible for creating humankind from soggy mud and clay.”
Charles pounds the sides of his fists against the soundproof glass. His right hand snaps off—and plops to the floor. He screams in silence at the bloody stump.
“Displeased,” Jonathan says, uninterrupted by Charles’ agony, “Zeus punished Prometheus by eternally adhering him to a rock, where, each day, an eagle swooped in and devour his liver,” after he rubs Ana’s belly, he licks his fingers, and says, “only for said liver to regenerate the next day. Prometheus, like Jesus Christ, reigned immortal.”
The closing title card appears:

“The Prometheus Project”

And the presentation fades. The laboratory fills with light. The screen rises. The embalming unit’s canisters contain the bodily fluids of Ana and Allison—both drained of life.
“And for your assistance,” Jonathan continues, “in reanimating and regenerating my beloveds, I’ll bless you both, and you, Charles, with perpetual youth to spend an eternity of sexual ecstasy,” as he raises his arm and looks upward, “with the Earth’s first real God.”
On cue, Bianka slinks across the room with a burgundy glass dangling by the stem from her hand. Once she fills the flute with fluids from the embalming unit, she gulps and retains the fluids in her mouth and swishes elixir. She sets down the glass, embraces Jonathan and kisses him deeply. A bead of the life-granting juices drips along her cheek as Jonathan gulps the elixir from her mouth. As their lips part, she wipes around the rim of Jonathan’s lips and slides her finger into his mouth; he sucks on her finger as she pulls it from his lips. Jonathan runs his tongue around his lips and teeth.
“What’s so funny?” says Jonathan in response to Bianka’s smirk and chuckle.
“That you’re a text book case,” replies Bianka as she plunges the same finger cleaned by Jonathan’s mouth into Ana’s stomach, “of Schopenhauer’s ‘Design Fault Theory,’” and licks Ana’s juices from her finger. “Wasting your time reflecting on a quest for meaning and purpose that renders satisfaction impossible.” She takes another gulp of the wine-blood from the burgundy flute. “You’re a ridiculous folklore fairy. A leprechaun, a mythical dragon,” Bianka tells Jonathan as she runs her finger under his chin. “You are nothing but a self-indulgent connoisseur of wine, surrounded by art works, and taken care of by a household.” She clutches his crouch. “You’re a fool who blunders around the world, wrapped up in the earthly natures of obligation and sexual affection.”
Jonathan inhales in deep ecstasy to Bianka’s squeeze. His mouth agape; his eyes gloss over.
“You’re a shell of a man who, to feel any reason or purpose in his sad, sorry life, must have his penis belong to someone else.” She licks her fingers as she slinks over to the observation room. She squeaks her wet finger along the exterior of the bloody glass.
She gazes through the glass, down at a silent Charles; his body twitches in a pool of body fluids and liquefied flesh.
“All the evils in the world,” says Bianka as her reflective, green eyes begin to illuminate, “come from one’s inability to sit quietly in a room, Jonathan.”
Jonathan’s stare widens, locked into her eyes.
“Will you ever learn,” continues Bianka, as she points to the center of Jonathan’s chest, “that salvation is within?”
Jonathan’s stare sinks deeper into the eyes, not of Bianka, but of Father Ed standing in her place.

Jonathan’s view blows out.

He shocks at his new discovery: he kneels, naked; adhered to a bondage stockade, center floor in the dance studio of the Kinski Estate.
“The growth,” bellows a disembodied Fritz, “you seek is up here, my boy.”
A naked Fritz flaps red-and-yellow feathered, winged back limbs, engaged in a mutual, sexual embrace with an eagle-winged Bianka. A silent and collared, donkey-legged Melanie Kinski dangles by a leash and kicks her hairy, hoofed appendage.
A tear falls from Jonathan’s eye.
“It is man’s activities,” Fritz advises Jonathan, “that serve as the root of his problems: his appetites, pining for possessions, craving power, desires to create, and aching for flesh on which to impose his will.”
“What did Goethe say about ‘creation’ in his poem, ‘Prometheus,’ Johnny?” asks Bianka.
Jonathan begins to quote Goethe’s 1789 poem:

“‘Here I sit, forming humans
In my image;
A people to be like me,
To suffer, to weep,
To enjoy and to delight themselves,
And to not attend to you —
As I.’”

Then the creaks of four simultaneous key cranks being wound on music boxes echo through the dance studio—and unleash the unsynchronized cacophony of “Act 1: No. 9 ‘Waltz of the Snowflakes,’” for solo piano from The Nutcracker. The disembodied quartet cackles of Barbara and Elizabeth Kinksi, and Ana Nicols and Allison Tisdell fill the studio:

“Es Fui Sum Eris.
As you are, so once was I.
Es Fui Sum Eris.
As you are, so once was I.
Es Fui Sum Eris
As you are, so once was I. . . .”

As Jonathan kneels, adhered to his bondage stockade, he sees four, life-sized, mechanical ballroom Cinderella dolls dance around him. He comes to realize the mechanical ballerinas are the ossified bodies of Barbara, Elizabeth, Ana, and Allison—each adorned as Wells Brimtoy clockwork fairy queens in blue crinoline dresses.
“And you will tend your creations, in your image, for an eternity,” bellows Fritz to Jonathan.
“We all make our choices in life, Jonathan,” adds Bianka. “Sometimes we put ourselves into sterile emotional lives and diseased environments to punish ourselves for pasts sins.”
“For we each chose our bodies,” says Fritz. “And we construct our own boxes, Jonathan.”
A tear of realization falls from Jonathan’s eye.

Jonathan’s view blows out.

Jonathan sees himself approach the doors of the Sacred Heart Parish.
Inside, he walks toward the confessional booth.
He enters the penitent compartment and drops down to the kneeler. A blood droplet hits the center of his forehead. He wipes away the blood and plays with the bodily fluid between his thumb and index finger. As he gazes upward, he notices the blood drips from a weeping crucifix on the wall above the lattice divider.
A blood droplet then splatters into the palm of his opened hand—into a five-petalled floral pattern.
The privacy screen slides open. Fritz, in the wares of a Catholic priest, sits in the priest compartment.
“Bless me Father, for I have sinned,” states Jonathan. “I have forsaken my spirit to quench my earthly desires.”
“Say Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s axiom, ‘Life belongs to the living, and he who lives must be prepared for change,’ six times for your absolution, my little Prometheus,” advises Fritz.
Jonathan digs his fingers into the lattice divider. He quote Goethe’s poem:

“‘I am not like you!
I know no poorer creatures
Under the sun, than you, Gods!
You barely sustain your majesty
With sacrificial offerings
And exalted prayers.’”

“And you’re never going to escape this box through offering or prayer, my dearest Jonathan,” replies Fritz.
As Jonathan pulls away his grip from the lattice divider, he realizes his stigmatic palm clutches a bloody medical scalpel. He raises the instrument over his head and thrusts the blade into his stomach. He slices into his belly, reaches into the wound, and rips out his own liver. He slams the organ to the floor.
Fritz’s head morphs in a horned demon. An eagle’s screech fills the confessional booth.

Jonathan finds himself back in the dance studio. He looks upward from the bondage stockade.
Bianka spreads her wings. Her feet morph into eagle’s claws as she swoops down from the ceiling. “And you’ll change each and every day,” adds Bianka. She lands and clutches his throat in her hand. “And now,” as she kisses him on the lips, she whispers into his ear: “you know.”
The cackling chorus of the mechanical dance quartet of Barbara, Elizabeth, Ana, and Allison echo across the studio, “Sin, confess, repeat. Sin, confess, repeat. Sin, confess, repeat. Sin, confess, repeat. . . .”
Bianka’s other hand morphs; she thrusts the eagle’s claw into Jonathan’s stomach—and rips out his liver. She bites. “Mmmm. Tastes like eternity.”
A tear falls down Jonathan’s cheek.
He stares out the window of the dance studio as snow collects on the sill; his view pushes through the window onto the fresh snow blanket.

His soul travels across the snow blanket, onto the grounds of Putman St. Mary’s Cemetery that leads onto a field of tombstones. He sees the gravestone for opera singer Ezio Pinza, then St. Joseph Mausoleum in the distance. He travels down a chair-lined corridor that leads to a mahogany and bronze casket surrounded by red and pink oleander floral arrangements set against a burgundy tapestry. Jonathan stares into the casket.
It is his own body that rests in the white interior.
He hears the closing of “Act 1: No. 9 ‘Waltz of the Snow Flakes’” for solo piano from The Nutcracker for one final time—the four music boxes grind to a close. The lid to his casket creaks, and shuts closed.

BIANKA’S Audi R8 coupe with white ibis body paint speeds westbound along Messe-Allee to the B2/Bundesstrasse.
Bianka presses her heeled foot into the accelerator.
Dr. Anton Konrad’s eyes flutter; he slumps in a groggy state in the passenger seat.

A banner draped across the Congress Center in Leipzig announces the next year’s German Interdisciplinary Meeting on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine.
Dr. Anton Konrad, Dr. Min-So Chang, and Dr. Dawood Zardari socialize in the atrium amid a crowd of mingling doctors.
Kate O’Mara, Charles, and Detective Rudy Tomlinson—adorned in server uniforms—carry trays of wine glasses. Kate approaches and serves Bianka. Bianka whispers to Kate, who nods an acknowledgment to her mistress.
“. . .Yeah, Jonathan certainly was a hell raiser. Good times,” says Anton.
“The convention won’t be the same this year without him,” says Min-So.
“Red or white, gentlemen?” interjects Kate. Anton, Min-So, and Dawood select red wines. Each admires Kate strut as she moves to serve the next patron. Kate turns and grins—and wags her donkey tail.
“I wonder if the panties hugging her ass are laced red or white,” says Dawood.
“Where’s your imagination, Woody,” says Anton. “She’s not wearing any.”
“Better watch it, Andy. Here comes Lena with a scalpel,” jokes Min-So.
“And speaking of ‘cumming,’” as Dawood nods his head. “Physician, heal thy aching in your crouch.”
“What I wouldn’t give for her to beat me and eat me,” says Min-So.
“And what I wouldn’t give just to eat her,” adds Anton.
Bianka approaches with a warm greeting. “Andy, Minny, Woody,” as she gives each a friendly peck on the cheek. “It is so good to see you gentlemen again, under more pleasant circumstances.”
“We were just toasting Johnny,” says Min-So, “and discussing how it’s just not the same this year without our fourth horseman.”
“Well, the rodeo isn’t over, yet,” replies Bianka. She waves to Ana Nicols and Allison Tisdell in the crowd. “I’d like you to meet two colleagues of mine. This is Ana. And this is Allison.”
Blood soaks the trouser crouches of Anton, Min-So, and Dawood. Anton’s eyes widen.

Anton awakens in the passenger seat of the Audi—to Bianka’s massage of his crouch. They travel southbound on the B2 Bundesstrasse.
“Works every time,” coos Bianka. “We’re almost there, sleepyhead.”
“Uh,” Anton clears his throat. “Where’s . . . ‘almost’ supposed to be?”
“Auerbach’s Keller. Don’t you remember, Andy? Our date.”
“Oh right.” Anton gazes in the side and rear view mirrors. “I don’t see Woody and Minny with the girls behind us.”
“Oh, don’t worry about them. Ana and Allison are attending to their desires.”

Inside the Sachsenpark Hotel in Leipzig, Germany, Min-So and Dawood sprawl across a double-wide bed. Ana and Allison, adorned in negligees, saunter over to them—on their hairy, cloven donkey legs as they wag their tails. They kneel over the two unsuspecting doctors and begin to bounce up and down. As Min-So and Dawood begin to climax—
Ana and Allison thrust their eagle-clawed hands into Min-So’s and Dawood’s stomachs and rip out their livers. Ana and Allison chomp down in delight. Min-So and Dawood groan in ecstasy with each chew.

Bianka’s hand jams the stickshift of the Audi.
Anton’s eyes travel along the curves of her hose-encased legs. Her stiletto heel digs into the accelerator.
“Lena would use her surgeon skills to chop it off if she found out what you were thinking, Andy.” She unzips Anton. “Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was right: Your penis never belongs to you, always to someone else.”
“Bianka, I’d let you eat me alive, and so help me God, I’d enjoy every bite.”
“Oh, I think that can be arranged.”
Anton grabs his crouch in pain; blood pools. Bianka jams the stick shift. She throws a sly grin and turns to you, as she stares out the driver’s side window. She licks her sticky fingers. “Mmmm. Takes like eternity.”
A silver necklace of a Vitruvian man crucified inside a pentagram dangles from Bianka’s neck. The face of the “man” is Father Ed. A bloody tear falls from his eye. “And now, you know,” says Bianka.

Thank you for spending your time with me in the pages of my first novel. If you enjoyed this book, I would appreciate it if you would take a moment to leave a review at your favorite eRetailer. If you are a literary manager or producer in the film industry and you enjoyed this book, I believe you would enjoy reading one of my screenplays. I hope to hear from you.
I do ask that you be kind in your reviews, as this book was a grass-roots effort on the part of this writer: I did not have the luxury of a publisher or editor, proof readers or fact checkers, or a graphics and public relations department. However, do not let that diminish the fact that I put forth my best efforts to provide you, the reader, the highest quality product possible, as your time and money is as valuable to me as it is to you.
