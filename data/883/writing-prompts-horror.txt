Writing Prompt #2 — The Unfamiliar
Prompt: While walking through the woods, you see a creature, unfamiliar to you, wounded. It begs for help.

I couldn’t understand what it said, but from its tears and held out hand, I guessed it needed help. I moved through the tall grass, knelt before it. It gripped its leg with both hands, the muscles underneath its pale flesh taunt.

I looked at its leg, and shook my head. What could I do? It shouted again in its unknown language. It put its arms together and rocked them side to side. After a few moments, I understood. Wrapping my arm under its legs, the other across its back, I stood, carrying it, and turned back where I came from.

The creature continued to cry, sobbing about its leg. I wished it would’ve stopped, honestly I did. The leg was hardly broken, and it was now being rescued, why cry further? But, when I looked down, its long blonde hair stuck to its sweaty wincing face, I realized how weak it truly was, and vaguely understood its pain.

By the guidance of its pointing and hand motions, I finally managed to escape the woods, to where the creature came from. The trees and thickets gave way to a wide, grassy field. Strange wooden structures were randomly placed, where other creatures sat. They seemed to be consuming some kind of food and liquid. They all spoke the same foreign language the creature spoke.

It pointed towards a group, three other creatures sitting on a checkered cloth. I strode across the grass, and set down the blonde-haired one.

They did not greet me with kindness, nor they did not thank me for the rescue. Each one removed unfamiliar square devices, emitting a blaring light. Repeatedly, the light flashed, obscuring my vision. 

Confusion intertwined with rage. I wanted to rip the squares from their tiny hands and smash them against their egg-shaped heads; but at the same time, I wanted to run, and put as much distance I could between them and I.

I decided on the latter. I ran across the field, submerging into the woods. Giant oaks blurred passed, thickets and underbrush flattened underfoot, chipmunks and squirrels darted away. At last, I came to my cave, hunched, and went inside.

I renewed my fire, sat, and as my rage subsided, pondered about the creatures.
.
Weird they were, with two legs and arms, hairless besides what was on their head and face: puny arms like sticks and legs seemingly useless… The strangest thing was they had two eyes instead of one, and possessed five fingers on each hand, while I only possessed two.

































Writing Prompt #11 — The Red Eye
Prompt: The storms covering Jupiter cleared, but only for a moment, and we saw what was beneath it.

The thin book was thrown onto Sean Carrien’s desk. He eyed it for a moment, then looked to his assistant. “What is this?”

“It’s the journal of Michael Yitz, Commander. That one scientist that went crazy when we landed on Earth. I found it stashed behind some books in a hidden drawer under his cot.”

“Have you read it?” Sean asked.

“No, I thought you would want to be the first. After what happened with Yitz and all those people…”

Sean wiped his mouth and leaned into his chair. “Yeah, all those people… Gone.” He straightened and pulled the journal closer. “I’ll get to it now. Come back in about an hour and we can go get some lunch.”

With a nod, his assistant turned and left the office, closing the door behind him.

Sean glanced through the pages, ignoring what seemed to be irrelevant information: Michael Yitz applying to work on the Atlas as a Moon Researcher, getting the job, his anxiety and first impressions of the ship, space, and everything else.

He stopped when he reached what he believed to be the beginning of the terrible incident that led to a group of innocent bystanders being gunned down… 

January 16, 2106

It’s that time of the year again, my dear journal, for us aboard the Atlas to check upon the moons of Jupiter. The ship has moved its course from Neptune, passed Saturn, towards the red-eyed planet.

In a month we will be on the brink of Jupiter's gravitational pull, like a boat pulled onto shore, and we will examine its moons. Europa first, then Io and Ganymede, and in all likelihood Callisto on the same day. Then Lysithea, Thebe, and Elara the following, then onto the countless others.

Even from this distance, Jupiter’s storms can clearly be seen through my porthole. The swirl of reddish orange and gray clouds, and the never-ending twisting red eye that reminds me of the Eye of Sauron from The Lord of Rings.

That’s it for now. It’s time to enter hibernation, so I can be well awake for my job.

Michael Y.

February 16, 2106

We’ve made it! With no issues at all, surprisingly… Well except for that someone aboard — as a prank — had activated a stink bomb in the co-ed toiletry. Some of it still lingers in some of the hallways. Besides that, we’re all ready to begin working.

Currently I’m in my station. The manually operated telescopic machines are all pointed in the direction of the moons, moved partially western to make-up for the Atlas’s drift. In a few moments, I will begin the seemingly endless hours of peering into the scopes and record what I see. Just like in 2096, there’ll likely be nothing too different to report. Though mundane and repetitive, I’m still glad to be a Moon Researcher. A much better career than doing God knows what back on Earth. 

February 16, 2106 — Later

I haven’t written my report, but… I wasn’t paying much attention to the moons. So I let the scope wander a little towards Jupiter. Although nothing changes on Jupiter, it hasn't in thousands of years, I looked. Maybe it’s just the boy in me who wanted to see the great big planet, or maybe it was just idle curiosity, but the point is: What I saw was mind boggling.

The storms and clouds dissipated. Dissipated! The western hemisphere hardly had any red and orange swirls, as though being vacuumed by something. I couldn’t get a good look at what was below the clouds — if I would have, I would’ve been the first who saw what’s beyond the storms of Jupiter! — because my supervisor came in, and I quickly adjusted the scopes back to Ganymede.

I’m shaking. I can hardly keep this pen straight enough to write. Tomorrow I will inspect more. I’ll even start early. My supervisor will think nothing of it, probably even give me a pat on the back for showing initiative. Now it’s time to try my best to sleep.

Michael Y.

February 17—20, 2106

Too much has happened. I’ve seen too much. I waited to write everything down at once… 
The storms were dissipating, yes, but even more over the course of time I was inspecting it. As if it knew when I was watching, the clouds disappeared entirely from the western hemispheres, then gradually from the center and eastern hemispheres. By the 19th, the clouds and storms were gone — all except the Red Eye. Which seemingly is not a storm or a cloud or a byproduct of Jupiter’s weather.

It seemed to be an actual eye. I magnified all my scopes to the farthest they could go, but I couldn’t make out exactly what it was. The dull golden layer of Jupiter appeared to be concave, moving like the ocean, but with tarry, sluggish movements.

Things moved out of the surface, long enormous pipe-like things, ripping open the ground to only drop back down. They twisted, spiraling, and turned around the planet’s entire surface, converging to below the Red Eye.

I couldn’t see past it, but I imagined what was below. The pipe-like things in all likelihood rose out of the ground and formed a rippling, swaying tower, rising, and piercing Jupiter’s atmosphere. It emanated the red substance to create the eye… Or, perhaps, the eye is a being itself and the world is its body? I still don’t have the faintest clue.

Motionless, I sat, watching  for hours, noting nothing. I was afraid that it was a hallucination, or that it was only for me to see, that if I shared it, something would happen to the ship.

The Red Eye abnormally moved freely around the planet, settling straight ahead, looking directly at the Atlas and me. A bubbling black hole formed in its center, a wispy tendril of darkness rose from red and slithered across space.

I wanted to move from the scope, I wanted to run, but I couldn’t budge. Even though fear engulfed my body, curiosity kept me there. 

Scope-I’s refractor blackened and shattered, its glass falling inward onto the reflector. Despite this, I kept my eye glued to the ocular lens. The reflector shattered; its glass drifted into space. The tendril coated the scope’s internals, creating a barrier between space and the hull.

The ocular lens broke, and the tendril stung my eye. I turned away, hissing, holding my eye, rubbing it, but I already knew it would give no relief. It was in my head now. I felt it coat my nerves, cover my brain… A tingly, prickly sensation drifted over my body as it burrowed into my mind.

I left my station, returned to my room, and began writing. My supervisor came to the open portal and asked me what happened and I said I didn’t feel well. She said since I came in early, it was okay for me to call it a day. I thanked her. She must’ve not seen the broken scope, or the Red Eye move freely over the planet, or the tendril crossing the cosmos.

I looked out the port window. Jupiter’s storms had returned.

I must return home, to Earth, and bring what I’ve been given. The Verpins must burrow far below the crust and shake the parasites from it, must rattle the planet, erupt its core; start its own storms; only after can They begin to create an Eye.

Then I must go to the Moon and Mars and Saturn and Uranus and Pluto and every other planet to spread the Eye, then beyond. 

The Eye granted me sight.

The Eyes will connect the far-reaching universes, the Eyes will bring an utopia to us all, the Eyes will be everything and anything.

Eyugu'th Tyth.

Sean closed the journal, sighed, and pressed the button on the intercom. “You can come in now.”

The assistant came in. “So what do you think?”

Ignoring the question, he asked: “Do you have the video recording of Jupiter on February 16, 2106 through February 20, 2106?”

The assistant nodded.

“I want them exported to my computer now.”

“Will do,” the assistant said and left.

Five minutes later, an alert appeared on the Commander’s monitor, and a loading bar filled with a teal color. He opened the downloaded file, setting it to full screen.

The video was at twenty-five times speed, but he didn’t notice any change on Jupiter. There was nothing. The storms never ceased, the red eye never differed from its normal rotation, and there certainly was no black tendril stretching across space to the Atlas.

As he went to turn off his monitor, he briefly caught a millisecond of blackness appearing in the red eye, then before he could stop the feed, his screen went black, his computer short-circuited, and powered down.
































Writing Prompt #15 — The Mouth… The Teeth
Prompt: When they finally found, her hair had turned white, huddling in a corner she kept chanting... Teeth... Teeth... Teeth.

Detective Morgan and I found her in the basement of an abandoned house by the slums. Shit and dirt caked her body, piss soaked through her clothes, her clumpy, mangled hair stuck to her face like it was mud. She was huddled in a corner, holding her bony knees to her chest by pale thin hands. At first she refused to speak, refused to even move from the puddle of filth she sat in. But slowly, we managed to get out from the corner, wrap her in a blanket we brought, and into the patrol car. We tried figuring out what happened to her, but all she said was: “Teeth… Teeth… Teeth.”

We brought her into the station, and the female officers brought her to the showers, and helped her get cleaned up. They gave her fresh underwear and clothing, and a cup of coffee. An officer escorted her into the interrogation room and sat with her until I arrived. I sat across from her. Her hair was now pulled back in a ponytail, and the hot water made her pale skin splotchy. The hazel eyes underneath her thick brows seemed to glimmer below from overhead light.

“Hello, I’m Detective Fred Gretz. What’s your name?” I asked.

She stared at the table, her arms at her side. I don’t think she even heard the question. So I tried again.

“I'm Detective Fred Gretz, what’s your name?”

Nada.

I sat back, tapped on the table, and like she was a deer in the headlights, she looked up at me. Maybe she’s deaf?

“Can you hear me?” I said to her.

She shook her head.

“Are you deaf?”

She nodded.

Well, I’ll be damned. I put my finger up and mouthed, “One minute” and left the room. When I returned, I had a notebook and a pen. I scribbled down my name and the original question, and slid it over to her. She pushed it back a moment later. In childish handwriting, she wrote: Hello. I'm Paige.

Nice to meet you Paige. I wrote. Do you have anyone we could call to let them know you’re here and safe? Like a parent or sibling?

No. She wrote back.

Okay, well, is there may be a friend we can talk to? Maybe a buddy from school?

No.

I sighed, rubbing my eyes. The clock said it was about two in the morning and I hadn’t slept in a while. I felt bad for her but I was getting nowhere. So I threw caution to the wind and jumped straight into it, hoping that she wouldn’t lose her shit.

So Paige, why were you down in the cellar?

I was hiding.

Hiding? From what?

The Mouth. I noticed she capitalized mouth, which I thought was weird at the time.

The Mouth? Is that a person or?

No.

No? So is it like a nickname or a place, or some kind of drug?

No.

I caught myself before habitually furrowing my brow in frustration, instead I kept my cool and smiled.

I'm sorry for my stupidity, Paige, but what is the Mouth?

It’s what took my hearing away.

You weren’t born deaf? I asked.

No. The Mouth and its Teeth took it away. Weird again, now capitalizing teeth too.

Did the Mouth and its Teeth do anything else?

Took away my family too. Ate them.

What do you mean, “Ate them?”

I finally found the right question to ask, because when she took the notebook away and feverishly started writing. She covered each page, front to back, with words, from the margin to the last line. Sweat broke out on her face. The hand gripping the pen became white-knuckled. 

When she finished, she chucked the pen, and shoved the notebook across the table. Paige sat back, pulled her knees to her chest, and closed her eyes, breathing heavily and slowly swaying to a sound that I couldn’t hear.

I didn’t even look at the notebook at first. I paged a female officer and had Paige escorted to a spare room in the station. I made sure the officer got her clean sheets, blankets, pillow, and anything else she might want. Then, I picked up the notebook.

Most of it was gibberish. I could hardly make sense of her jutting and curvy handwriting… But what I could told a hellish story.

We summoned it. The Mouth and its Teeth. [A squiggly line.] The walls, the floors, the ceiling: black gums, stretching and peeling. Wet, greasy saliva and blood. [Incomprehensible words.] The Teeth tore through the world, opened reality, revealing the Ether.

They’re gone! We were promised safety to pass by [Some sort of symbols, like hieroglyphs.], but the leaders, my friends, were taken! Bitten into two in front of me! [Swirling lines.]

I ran home, left them in their blood and organs. My home became what I left. I couldn’t escape it! [Strange, jutting symbols.] Before I got to my parents, they were gone through the lipless gums emerging from the walls.

We should’ve left it alone, should’ve left The Gray Writ be. God… [Slashing lines, crisscrossing across the remainder of the page.]

The cellar was safe for a while. Then the Mouth enveloped the house. Black tendrils slithered from the Ether beyond the Opening, from the other side. [More slashing lines, though twisting and swirling at the ends.] They corkscrewed in the air, passing through my hands, holding my rattling head, and entered my ears.

I couldn’t hear. [Solid black, like a censorship bar.] I couldn’t hear the Mouth open and close, open, and close. So dark, so very dark. [Thick, filled in diagonal lines stretching across the paper.] No light anywhere, no matter where I went or looked. Was I blind?

Has it been a year? two? ten? [Overlapping numbers. Some could partially be made out, like 50, 70 and 1,000.]

Vibrations upstairs, coming down. [Large, empty circle in center of page. Words around it.] I had been deaf for ages, but still could hear the sounds of the creaky basement stairs in my head.
Then I was taken here. [A crudely drawn shield.]

“Jesus Christ…” I whispered, setting down the notebook.

When I returned to my desk, I hid the notebook in one of the locked cabinets. Detective Morgan came over and asked about Paige. I told him she was just a poor deaf girl that had been homeless for a while. I said I’d figure something out for her, call a couple of the shelters, and find a room for her. He slapped my shoulder, told me I was a good guy, and an even better cop. He met my gaze, saw my black bags, and urged me to get some sleep. I nodded, thanked him, and got my jacket from my chair and left the station.

The rain pelted my car. Thankfully, it was late into the evening and there were hardly any other drivers. A trip that usually took me ten minutes only took about six. I pulled into my driveway, killed the engine, and ran into the house, shielding myself with my coat.

I hung the jacket up as I walked down the hallway, into the kitchen. I flicked the light switch but no lights came on. I tried again. Nothing. I went into the dining room, tried the switch there. It didn’t work either. The power must be out, I thought. Damn.

I went up to my bedroom, and rifled through the drawer, searching for some clothes to change into.

Something creaked behind me and instinctively I whipped around, kneeling, like I was carrying. Paige appeared from the gloom. She no longer wore the clean clothing the station provided, no longer did her hair look washed. Blood and grime matted the hair to her face, black liquid dribbled down the sides of her mouth, dirt and mud caked her hands and feet.

“The Mouth… The Teeth…. We can’t escape, we’re bound.” She whispered.

I strode to her and sat her onto my bed. I picked up the phone on the nightstand to find it also not working.

“Paige,” I said, turning to her. “We have to go back to the station. I don’t know how you got here, but we have to get you back. We’ll get you some new clothes — don't worry about these ones — and a warm ba—” I stopped mid-sentence, remembering she was deaf.

“The Teeth… They come.”

A flash of lightning filled the room, casting long shadows across the floor. The sky grumbled and shook the house. The rain sounded like stones pummeling the roof.

“I’ll just take you now.” I gently took her hand and walked her to the stairs. One by one, like she was a child learning how to walk downstairs, she went. We reached the bottom and I held up a finger, then ran into the kitchen for my keys. When I returned, she had vanished.

“What the fuck…” I seethed, furrowing my brow.

“Paige!” I ran into the living room, the dining room, back into the kitchen. “Paige! Where are you?” Screaming like it would do any good. I took the stairs by two and checked the second story, to find it as vacant as before. “Paige, c’mon! We have to get to the station! You can’t be here.” I threw open the basement door and hurried down the creaky stairs, grabbing a flashlight dangling from the hook by the backdoor.

The dull light illuminated the cellar, revealing Paige in the corner, crouching, trembling, weeping. I knelt next to her, rubbing her back. “Hey, it’s going to be okay; everything will be fine. C’mon, let's just go and get you cleaned up, okay?”

“It’s not going to be okay. It’s not going to be fine. It's here.”

“You can hear m—”

The house shook, but not from the thunder. It felt like an earthquake tore through the basement to the crawl space. An eerie violet light filtered in through the small windows by the ceiling, and thick, black webbing lines spread across the walls. The door to the upstairs slammed shut.
The lines crisscrossed down the walls, over the floor, stretching over the ceiling. Like a broken mirror, the space in between the intersecting lines shattered, but instead of falling into the room, they fell inward into a swirling void. A deep purple replaced the violet, sending the room into even more darkness.

“What’s happening? What’s going on?” I asked, moving closer to Paige.

Everything gave way at once.

“The Opening,” she whispered.

Pinpricks formed in the far wall; thin lines of light pierced the gloom. The pinpricks rotated in the void, like dancing stars, and collided together, dropping to the floor.

Kaleidoscopic colors exploded from where they fell, covering the cellar — though it was no longer a cellar, but an endless space of swirling, colorful nothingness.

“The Ether.”

A multicolored horizontal line shot through the room, and split into two, like watching lips open from inside a mouth. Beyond were endless rows of deep valleys, and giant mountains… Its layers melted away, revealing deep-seated crevices lined with black, oily gums of a world-sized mouth. The mountains were teeth, enormous, jagged, and blunt.

The cellar was gone, replaced by oily darkness. The sky replicated below, and the mountain-sized teeth came down, sending chunks of decayed enamel into the bleeding gums.

“The Mouth… The Teeth.”

Swirling tendrils with endlessly peeling mouths rose from the blackened gums. They slithered in the air like snakes in water, drifting nearer. I scrambled back, warding them off with my hand, but slipped on a patch of greasy blood and fell. They lunged instantly, entering my raised palm, shooting through my veins, igniting my nerves like a wick, then there was nothing but blackness.

I came to, huddling in a corner of a cellar, nude, and trembling. Debris and trash littered the floor, piles of it scraping the ceiling. A bright light suddenly flashed. I covered my eyes until they stopped stinging. A man in a tan jacket walked down the stairs, covering his mouth with a handkerchief. I couldn’t understand what he was saying, but from his lips I think he asked, “Gretz? Is that you?”

I dumbly nodded.

In a blur, I was taken to the station, washed, and given new clothes, and placed in an interrogation room, with the lights dimmed. Detective Morgan came in, sat, and asked something. I shook my head.

“You deaf?” I read his lips.

I nodded.

He said something, got up and left. He returned soon with a pen and paper.

Tell me what happened, Gretz. He wrote.

I took the pen in my shaking hand, and began telling him the story of Paige, the Ether, the Opening, and the Mouth and Teeth.
















Writing Prompt #16 — The Unknown Dialect
Prompt: You say goodnight to your wife and kids, close your eyes, and wake up the next morning as if it were just another day. You walk downstairs to grab breakfast with your beautiful family only to hear that they all now talk in a foreign language you have never heard.

The kitchen backdoor was open. Something like a meteor was in the yard. Large, craggy, with a gold layer rippling over a transparent green shell. I didn’t hear anything last night, surely I should’ve if something that big fell into the lawn.

Sharon, my wife, said something from the table. I turned to her. “What did you say? And what’s that thing outside?”

“Eraluth meg’ath nousth,” she said, smiling to Stevey, who sat across from her.

Stevey, dirty from playing outside that morning, I guessed, smiled. “Asouth de’ath aggilth’b.”

“What are you guys saying? Is this one of those made-up languages to fool me?” I looked from my wife to my son, confused. I had taken French, Spanish, and even some Latin in college but what they spoke sounded obscure, odd, that I recognized none of its dialect.

She looked at me and said: “Acum’th uonagg tura-tae’ggth” and Stevey said cheerily, “Manjeuth ujjothyine nagith.”

I noticed her eyes… They were originally crystal blue, but now, they were tinged green and gold, and Stevey’s were light hazel and not brown. Maybe it was the way the sun hit them? I shook my head. Didn’t explain why they were speaking the way they were.

“C’mon, stop joking around. We have stuff to do today and I can’t have you speaking gibberish, the neighbors will think we’re crazy.”

Stevey glanced at his mother, nodded. “Uejith neugg brujth.”

My temples throbbed, and clenched my hands. It was fun at first, but now it was annoying. It was too early for this, especially when we planned to go to the park with the neighbors. “All right, cut it out now. It’s not funny anymore.”

Stevey faced me, repeating what he said to his mother.

“Now quit it!” I roared, slamming my fist on the table. “If you talk like that one more time, you’re grounded for a week!”

Sharon said, grinning. “Houg’th nyuaeth blougfh.”

I quickly turned to her. “And you too, Sharon! Don’t fucking play along with this! You’re a parent, too!”

They both suddenly stood up, their chairs toppling to the ground. Stevey and Sharon side-by-side, who walked towards me. I stumbled back, nearly falling against the stove. Incessantly they droned in unison: “Suoth’in jus’goi noijgus.”

“Stop! For the love of god stop this!” I moved from the stove to the wall. They jerked forward at a speed I didn’t see, as if they teleported.

Standing before me, unmoving, smiling.

“Stop, please!” I begged. “If you don’t, God help me I will do what I have to do!” I didn’t want to hurt them, they were my family, but the way they were acting drove me insane.

Sharon placed her hand on my shoulder, and the pent-up frustration exploded inside me. Before I knew it, I punched her in the stomach. It was like punching a cement wall. Bones snapped, and a fiery pain shot up my arm. I cradled my hand against my chest, rubbing it, crying. I slid down the wall, sitting on the floor.

“What are you? You’re— you're not my family.” I murmured.

Sharon leaned forward, placing her face an inch before mine. Her wide eyes grew beyond human capabilities, and the green and gold inside began to twist, to swirl around her cornea. The snaking colors sprung from her eyes and everything went black, as a sharp pain washed me.







Writing Prompt #18 — Johnny's Birthday
Prompt: When a person turns eighteen, their last words appear somewhere on their body. Yours frighten you intensely.

Johnny’s parents managed to book him a night club for his eighteenth birthday. All his friends and some of his family members were on the dance floor while pop music blared from the enormous speakers by the DJ. Multi-colored strobe lights lanced through the darkness, whizzing and zipping over the tables, walls, people.

Johnny sat at a corner table, hanging out with his best friend Tom. They scrolled through their phones, checking Facebook and Instagram for any new messages from the girls they invited. Johnny was still seventeen, but by ten o'clock, which was only in fifteen minutes, he would finally be an adult.

“Man, I can’t wait!” He shouted over the music to Tom.

Looking up from his phone, Tom said. “Yeah! It’s going to be totally awesome. Maybe your parents will let you get a car now!”

“Hopefully!” He checked the time. It was ten minutes away. He said to Tom, “Hey! Wanna go to the store and pick up a pack of smokes? I’ll be able to buy them legally!”

Tom clicked off his phone, pocketed it, and got up from the table. “Absolutely!”

The store stood at the corner of 5th and 4th Street, and only a five-minute walk from the club. The quiet night fell over them as they left the blaring music. The cold air felt good on their warm skin, and they joked around as they moved down the sidewalk. Dull light came through the transparent plastic walls of the convenience store, falling on the sidewalk and street.

Before entering, Johnny double-checked that he had his ID on him — wouldn’t want to forget that.

Tom pushed open the door and Johnny followed him in. Two people were in front of them in line, and Johnny checked his phone again. Two minutes left, he thought.

The line moved quicker than he anticipated and soon they were next. The slouched, wrinkly old cashier had beady, black eyes. “What do you want?” she croaked.

“Pack of smokes, Marlboros.” Johnny said, taking out his wallet.

“Got any ID?” she asked.

“Yeah, yeah I do, it’s right—” Tom snatched his wrist and pulled his arm close to his face.

“When did you get a tattoo?” he asked.

“What are you talking about? I didn’t get a tattoo.”

“Bullshit!” He shoved Johnny’s arm back. “Just look, on your wrist.”

Small and black, and it seemed to be a sentence. He raised his wrist, and started to read it aloud.
“Run, Tom, ru—”

The door to the convenience door exploded open by two men in black clothes and ski-masks. Tommy and Johnny spun to them instinctively, and their eyes widened as cold fear shot up their backs. The men carried two shotguns.

“What the hell do you want?” The old lady spat. “Get out of my store you damn hooligans!”

“Fuck you, you old broad,” one said, and pulled the trigger.

Tom dropped to the floor, his hands over his head, but Johnny dumbly watched Tom fall, wondering why he would do that, then looked at the man when he pulled the trigger. The shot sent Johnny flying against the counter, blood erupting from now the large hole in his abdomen.

The world became hazy, deafening; a blackness circled his vision and he steadily grew cold and numb. He couldn’t catch his breath, no matter how much he gulped at the air. His limbs trembled and tears streamed down his face.

The gun went off again, but he couldn’t see or tell where. Paper and plastic splashed the air like confetti above him, drifting down onto the blood-soaked floor.

Tom lay on the ground, shaking, a pool of urine under him, but still alive. Tom, his eyes filled with fear and tears, looked at Johnny.

“Run, Tom, run,” Johnny muttered, before blackness overwhelmed him.


Writing Prompt #19 — The Thing from the Fourth Dimension
Prompt: You are running for your life from a four-dimensional creature that can phase in and out of your three-dimensional space.

What has occurred up hitherto is something that must be put down into history, though it is doubtful that any poor soul would discover it.

A week or perhaps it was only a day or two, ago, I stumbled upon a relic in the museum on one of my many trips there. I’m fond of ancient and dusty things, and the past is far more interesting than the present. It was a round box with rusted golden trim, and a clear, large jewel embedded in the top. When I questioned one of the directors about it, they insisted it was not a diamond or any other type of common, transparent gem. They believed it to be a mix of moonstone, though lacking the milky color, and morganite, though, again, lacking the pinkish tint.

Under the electric light of the display, the gem sparkled and gleamed, sending blades of kaleidoscopic colors over my clothes. I moved out of the way and allowed the colors to plaster the wall… It's hard to describe, for I hardly believed it myself.

It appeared the light created a hole in the wall, but simultaneously, there was no hole at all. I could peer through the wall, view its insides, the wood, the plaster, the nails, and also clearly see into the connecting room. However, when I placed my hand over the hole, I felt the solid wall.

Initially I believed my mind was playing tricks, and that's what I assumed the other attendants at the museum believed, too, but after experimenting with other things — what a fool I must've appeared to the others who walked or idled by — like a piece of paper, a notebook, a watch, and whatever else I could manage to bring into the museum. It was all the same. I could see the insides of the paper, the thin, nearly microscopic insides; the leaves of paper inside the notebook; the inner workings of the clock.

But when I stood before it myself, allowing the light to fall onto me, I could not see into my body; nor even when I lifted my shirt and let it cast on my flesh. Before I was escorted out of the building by one of the burly security guards, I knelt and watched the light fall onto the other attendees as they viewed other exhibits, and I couldn’t see inside them either.

When I returned to my apartment, confused, intrigued and in dismay, I paced for quite some time. If the gem had the ability to open a sort of other dimension, then what did the box contain? Was what was inside the cause of it? Or was the gem but a catalyst? I pondered what may cause something like this, but came up with nothing. I was no scientist or physicist, just a curious fool.

The next day I set out early for the museum. The harsh wind was cold, and snow fell like dandruff. I came up with a plan, despite the danger and illegality of it, I had to know what was in that box. It weighed on my mind like a lead helmet. It was all I thought about, all I dreamed about, it was all consuming and just a peek would relieve me greatly.

I stood before the exhibit. There were no security or other attendees nearby. My body trembled and sweat started soaking through my clothes. I wiped my forehead, taking a deep breath. Quickly I snatched the artifact from its cushioned pedestal, held it underneath my overcoat and rushed out of the museum, keeping my eyes to the ground.

I only wanted to look inside. I’m no criminal, thief, or degenerate, just heavily curious. My intentions were to return it once I discovered what was inside, but God what a fool I was.

I sat on my apartment floor, it before me. I twisted the top, for it seemed to be screwed on, and removed it. As though a shadow passed over the light coming in through the window, my room darkened, but returned to normal a moment later. Inside the container was nothing, not a piece of paper, not another gem, not a single damn thing.

* * *

Fool! I said to myself, screwing the cover back into place. What I fool I am! Then suddenly an idea dawned on me, stopping me in my self-loathing.

I held the container under the light, and the gem sparkled yet there was no longer a rainbow, no light seemed to refract from the crystal. Had something released? I thought. Was I correct to believe that something inside was causing the rainbow? I must have been, for the rainbow was no more... But what was released?

After setting the box down, I stood and searched around the room. Nothing had changed, no furniture had moved, not even the books sitting atop the dresser had fallen over, but I noticed underneath one of the chairs was a hole in the floor. I slid the chair out of the way, and found the same as the one in the museum. Solid to the touch, but I saw the inside of my floor: the floorboards, the nails, the dust and ash and mice pellets.

Kneeling, I placed my face a few inches away, and something in between the space of my floor and not my floor  rippled, as though something had run past the hole. I jerked straight. Briefly, I caught sight of it but it gave the impression that it was large, like a beast of some sort.

I moved the chair back, and faced the box. There was now a hole underneath it, like the one I had just inspected. I snatched the box up, tossed it onto my bed, and peered into the hole. Again, I saw the woodwork of the floor but as I turned away, something passed by in that place that isn't a place. I stumbled back, wide-eyed.

God what a monster it was! I could hardly conceive its form: multiple legs carrying a titanic body, but yet not? The way it moved gave the impression it was light as a feather, but its body seemed so enormous it would be impossible for something of that size to move that fast.

I ripped off the blanket from my bed, and placed it over the hole. There, fine; if I couldn't see it, I thought, then it couldn't bother me. But then the hole pierced the blanket, passing through like a lit wick through paper. The monster passed by once more, but nearer.

I think I made out its head, its face, its maw of a mouth. No, God, no... This couldn't be happening, I told myself. I turned— Another hole in the wall, a smaller one above in the ceiling, one more crudely made on the floor. The creature crossed them at all once. I had to get away, praying it was bound to my apartment.

I threw open the door and sprinted down the stairs to the sidewalk. As soon as the winter wind hit me, I realized I forgot my jacket but I refused to go back. I looked from one end of the street to another, pondering where to go. I decided on the coffee shop a few blocks away, so after crossing the street, I tried my best to appear casual and walked there.

Inside was warm and welcoming with the aroma of coffee and fried dough. I ordered a cup of the black brew, and once received, sat at a small table near the window. The warmth radiating through the ceramic mug felt good cupped in my hands, and the steam drifting over my face, relaxed my raging thoughts. I closed my eyes and inhaled. God it smelled amazing. I took a sip. Tasted amazing, too.

I opened my eyes and glanced out the window, mid-drink— There was a hole in the street, like a sinkhole, and in the sidewalk, and spread across a shop, and even... No, that wasn’t possible... but in the sky! The mug almost shattered in my hand as I gripped it with dear life.

The monster passed by all of them at once, but now its details could be seen. A tooth-filled, jagged maw of swirling nothingness, stretching into the pits of the earth; dozens of eyes protruding from the center of its face, each oddly, differently shaped with colored irises without a name; its mane, one like a lion’s, a tangled mass of kaleidoscopic tendrils, swirling and twisting as if each strand was sentient.

I choked back a scream. With a trembling hand I set down the cup, and peeked at the others in the shop. None of them saw it, none of them screamed or ran or reacted to the monstrosity lurking just outside. Was I going mad? Was I hallucinating? Or was it because I was the fool who opened the box and released the imprisoned abomination?

* * *

These questions lingered in my mind for a moment before a hole larger than all the others, blanketed the coffee shop. The walls, windows, ceiling, counter, everything was covered. People still walked, talked, drank, and laughed as if nothing had changed but I could see everything and anything, into everything and anything; the inner workings of the machines, the woodworking of the floor and ceiling, the cement-work of the brick walls , and... in the distance of this vast, empty plain, the monster running towards me in the far distance.

I screamed. I could not hold it in any longer. I leapt up and ran out from the shop. No longer could the cement I ran upon be seen; nor sky, the shops, even the people soon vanished before my eyes. Everything was desolate, a place overlaying the world. I ran for what felt like hours, and my legs gave out. I gulped at the air. Nothing changed, no familiarity of my world returned. I was now a prisoner, and the monster’s prey. In the distance I could hear its gurgling roar, echoing through the air.

I sat, took out the small pad and pencil I had in my pocket, and began this entry. Perhaps one day someone will find it, perhaps it will somehow seep into the real world and make its way into someone’s lap, or, perhaps, it will stay here for all eternity… 

I must go, I have wasted too much time writing. The roaring has grown, the ground shakes under its titanic weight. The monster comes and I must hide, to live on... Is there a tomorrow in this world?












Writing Prompt #20 — The Unwanted Elder God
Prompt: One day you wake up with the powers of an elder god, space and time are yours to command. A few days later there's a knock at the door. You answer it to find Cthulhu in a suit and tie, "I believe there's been a mix up." He says.

Before I could usher him away, he pushed passed me and into my office. I was taken aback that his size was that of a normal person, not titanic that so many claimed him to be. He turned in the center of the room and faced me.

“I have come to issue a cease and desist on the behalf of the Elder Gods,” Cthulhu said, glancing around the room.

“What? Why?” I closed the door and neared him. “Why would they do that?”

“Well, simply because you're doing the work of others and you are not a true Elder God, and this is the most professional way to go about it. Oztalun wanted to seal you far below the earth, Orryx wanted to strap you to a chair and force you to look upon him for eternity, and Vorvadoss... Well, I do not want to get into what he wanted to do.

"The point is we want you to cease doing the work of an Elder God — driving men to madness, giving them insight far beyond their comprehension, having books written about you that speak of forbidden knowledge that only the insane would read, and so forth.” Cthulhu placed his briefcase onto the small coffee table, opened it and took out a thick, rope-bound document. He closed his briefcase, picked it up, and tossed the document onto the table.

I knew of the Ones Before Me, but I did not believe that they would be humanistic about it. They are uncaring, unimaginable, unworldly gods; why would they care that I, too, was similar to them, albeit more modern? I had an office where I consulted those who wished to learn beyond the reality they believed in so dearly, I scheduled appointments and meetings, published works of ancient knowledge, I did things that the Elder Gods refused to do.

I wanted to guide those unfortunate souls towards the path of esotericism, so, perhaps, they would release their grip on the modern gods of present day and worship those who are worthy, like the Elder Gods, or the Outer Gods, or the Great Old Ones. I was doing them a service and they do this?

“You know I can read your mind, right?”

“Sorry, totally forgot. So why do this? I am helping the Elder Gods without them doing any work.”

Sighing, he said. “You give us a bad name, truthfully. We are not supposed to be in sight, we are not supposed to help or harm the humans, we are not supposed to even be known — but thanks to some author, who will not be named, we are. We are the uncaring, the unmoving, we are the ones who are behind the veil of reality that only a few idiots look behind. What you are doing is whitewashing who we are, what we are, and doling out information that is not meant for humanity.”

I stood in silence for a moment, then asked, “What if I choose not to?”

“I could not describe what horrors lay in wait for you if you choose that course of action, but remember that it is not just men who go mad when dealing with the Elder Gods.” He strode to the door, opened it. “Oh, and also do not forget that I have acquaintances in places that are far beyond all the Gods you know of.” Then he left, turned down the hall and disappeared.

I shut the door, walked over to my desk. leaned against it. I stared at the large document sitting on the table, then closed my eyes. 

God... What was I to do?












Writing Prompt #26 — The Watcher
Prompt: You wake up in the middle of the night hearing a loud repeated thumping sound coming from downstairs. Suddenly the sound stops and a voice says, “Don’t worry. It’s dead.”

The stairs creaked under my weight. A soft light fell across the floor downstairs from the living room. I heard heavy breathing, scrambling, a shifting of something big. At the bottom of the stairs, I peeked around the corner. My mother stood over something odd and large.

It was like an enormous person wrapped in a sleeping bag, yet the way it’s skin rippled and broke apart like burnt paper, or the sound it made when it moved like rustling, dried leaves told me it was not. My mother’s hair was in a bun, a few strays hanging over her forehead. When I went to sleep she was wearing a dress and a blouse, but now she wore black sweatpants and a faded band t-shirt. As she maneuvered the thing over to the couch, the muscles in her thin forearms stood out and sweat covered her face.

“Mom?” I said from the stairs, now crouching, afraid of what she was handling.

She stopped mid-movement and turned. “Honey, what’re you doing up?”

“I heard a loud noise, then heard someone say, ‘Don't worry. It’s dead.’”

My mother stepped over the large thing towards me, swiping the hair from her eyes. “It was nothing honey, just a bad dream. Go upstairs and go back to bed. I’ll be up in a minute to tuck you in.”

I shook my head. “Can’t sleep, too scared.”

“Johnathan, go back up—”

“Mommy! It’s moving!”

Before my mother could turn, the thing rose and stood straight, looming. It nearly touched the ceiling.

“Run!” she screamed. “Run Johnathan! Go!”

A seam ran down it’s center, like a zipper without a zipper, and hundreds of layers peeled away from its middle, revealing rows upon endless rows of tiny, tar dripping fangs that ejected from vibrant blue and green gums. In its center, so far away, so deep in its body that it was like I was staring down a mile-long hallway, was the sound of crackling kindling and guttural moans. Something moved in its distance, jerking forward as if time skipped. The moans grew louder, closer, nearer.

Urine streamed down my numb leg. I couldn’t move, could hardly breath, only stupidly crouch there as the thing opened further, becoming a bottomless cocoon.

She strode to the stairwell, taking out her cellphone, dialed, screaming. “It’s not dead! I was wrong! The Watcher is coming!”

My mother threw the phone aside, turned and picked me up, and sprinted through the kitchen, out the backdoor. The starless sky was endless, not even the moon was out. She nearly slipped on the wet grass, but she didn’t stop, didn’t falter. Past the garage, and across the small strip of woods that divided our yard and the neighbors. We came to an empty doghouse, a dachshund that passed a year before, and set me down, crouched and dug in the dirt. After a few moments, she pulled out a plastic bag. Inside were keys, a wallet, and a gun.

“Mommy, mommy, what’s happening?” I cried, my arms wrapped around my chest, shivering.

“Nothing dear, nothing at all. We’re going to stay at Uncle Frank’s for a while, you’ll get to play with your cousins Sammy and Tiffany.” She rubbed my face with her fingers, smiling.

“But I don’t want to, they’re girls.”

“It’ll be just fine, it’ll only be for a while then we’ll find somewhere to live, somewhere safe.”

“Safe from who, mommy?”

Her eyes widened for a moment, then she shook her head. “No one, no one dear.”

“But momm—”

“No buts, now be a good boy and stop asking questions. We have to meet him soon.”

“Who?”

“What did I just say?”

I pouted briefly, then she took my hand, and we walked the small incline of the neighbor’s backyard to the street. From there we went to the intersection at the end of the road, where a black van sat. The driver’s side window rolled down, revealing my uncle. “Hey little man, what do you want to listen to?”

My mom pulled open the side door, and as I got in, I said, “Anything that mommy wants to listen to.”

She slid the door closed, buckled me in, and shuffled to the passenger seat. My uncle glanced at her, and smiled. “Got anything in mind?”

She rolled her eyes. “Just drive.”

Fifteen minutes later, we entered a patch of wood, and Mom hadn’t decided on anything to play on the radio, so we sat in silence.

Then, suddenly, there was an explosion in the distance. I turned in my seat, looked out the back window. A tuft of black smoke rose into the sky. Oddly, it seemed to be coming from where my house would be.


















Writing Prompt #28 — He Has Risen, He Has Risen…
Prompt: You are a 911 operator working the night shift. It’s been a normal night, but all the sudden every phone rings at once. 

“Things! God! Things!” a man roared.

“There’s— there’s shapes, spinning, so black, so very black— I can’t— I can’t read what they say but—” Another shouted until her words became lost in screaming.

“Et ortum est, se habet: surrexit, non est orta, sed surrexit: surrexit enim, cum ipse surrexerit ad Vetus unus de prioribus surrexit ut nobis, dona nobis oculis meis, ut liceat nobis videatur, ut et nos gustare ac sentire, et volant, sed surrexit: et ortum est, se habet—” A young boy, maybe only ten, droned until I was forced to switch to another call that was just a woman screaming gibberish into the phone.

The endless ringing filled the office, blending with the incessant ringing coming from the other offices. I couldn’t keep up with them, no matter how quickly I answered, no matter how quickly I read the prompt in front of me, I couldn’t keep up.

I spat and threw the headset onto the table, and pushed away from the desk, standing. I strode down the hallway and looked into the closest office to find it empty. I went to the next one, also empty. I started to run and glanced at each office I passed to find them all vacant.

“Where is everyone?” I shouted. I went through the double doors, down the stairwell, and out the front doors. The palpable air reeked of salt and decay. Immediately I felt like I hadn’t showered in weeks, and sharp pangs shot through my gums, as though my mouth was lined with cavities. I gripped the side of my mouth, wincing, and slowly walked into the street. They were empty, no one and nothing could be seen in either direction.

The sky— God, the sky teemed with colors that I couldn’t hardly remember the names of, if I had once learned them. My memories were fuzzy, my thoughts melting like gobs of honey, so hard to hold onto before it seeped through my fingers. The pastel, vivid, burning hues blended together like waves in the ocean above, twirling, swirling, forming maelstroms of beautiful, horrible things.

It was night now— or had it always been night? I couldn’t recall seeing the sun set, the moon rising, the stars coming out— could I even see those things with those colors, those wonderful colors? Something dark, shadowy rose on the horizon, so far away and bigger than the enormous, obsidian pillars, hideously etched with glowing sigils, jutting from the ground. It was round but not, bending to make new shapes, new forms, new things that didn’t have names just yet or would never have.

It rose and blocked the colors, blocked out any and all light coming from above. Peridots and sapphires speckled hundreds of openings that suddenly appeared out of the blackness, and vats of vibrant gemstones and diamonds swelled and spilled into our world from their world.

Words appeared in my head, not my own, but from someone— somewhere else.

He has risen, he has risen; we see all, we now see everything.






























Writing Prompt #29 — Incredible Man and the Eldritch Villain
Prompt: An unstoppable hero sees something that drives them insane. Describe what ensues.
 
The day was sunny, the people were happy, the world itself seemed to smile. Incredible Man zipped past the skyscrapers, waving to the citizens. His brilliantly white teeth shined, his bright blue eyes gleamed, and his perfectly set black hair blew in the breeze. Past the city, he made his rounds in the suburbs, then the downtrodden areas. With his muscular arms he stopped a car-jacking, a robbery, and convinced a drug addict to find some help. It appeared no matter where Incredible Man went, or who he spoke to, something great happened because of it, as if his presence were enough to end the world of misery and pain.

Suddenly, there was a disruption in the air. He had keen senses, that of a hundred men. He smelt a waft of decay.

“Hm…” he said, glancing towards the horizon, then smiled when he realized it didn’t matter what caused the disruption, nothing could stand against Incredible Man. He knew this, the people of the world knew this. No villain could rival him. He kicked off the ground, and zipped towards the disruption.

As the stretch of highway and desert blurred below him, the stench of decay grew stronger, the air becoming thick, palpable. Incredible Man slowed his flight and found deep, carved symbols etched the highway, ones even he couldn’t understand. They reminded him of Nordic runes, but didn’t read like them, no matter how much he tried. They just seemed weird, made him feel… off.

He faced ahead, picking up his speed. It didn’t matter, he thought as he smiled, they were gibberish.

The blue sky turned dark fuchsia, then an even darker crimson. It was like the sun was the heart and gradually its beat slowed, the surrounding sky dying. Night quickly fell, but there weren’t stars or a moon; nothing but pitch blackness. The symbols carved into the road glowed like dying embers, waves of soft, fiery light illuminating the pavement and sand. The temperature dropped to frigid levels.

No matter, he thought, I can see in the dark perfectly, and I don’t get cold. Incredible Man increased his speed.

Immediately he felt the immense weight of something miles ahead. Even his night vision couldn’t make out what it was. He slowed, then as the air became like flying in gelatin, he stopped. The symbols below were deeper with hideous colors. Fire was at the bottom, casting shadows onto the ground, and before Incredible Man looked away, he believed he saw someone move in the darkness.

“Who goes there?” Incredible Man shouted. “I am Incredible Man, Savior of Mankind and Protector of What is Good and Just!”

Silence followed, stillness weighing upon him like lead.

“I asked, ‘Who goes there?’ It is proper to announce who you are villain before I vanquish you!”
A gaunt man shuffled out of the darkness. He radiated a soft glow, as if he was a conduit of light. He held a gnarled staff, that he leaned against. Long, silvery hair rimmed his bald head, flowing over his shoulders. His cataract eyes stared at Incredible Man.

“You?” Incredible Man asked.

“Yes, me,” the old man said, as if he were sighing, “I have aged since our last battle, but since then I have not been idle.”

“Disastrous, Dangerous Darath!” He laughed. “You’re an old fool now! Is this what I sensed in the city? You?” He pointed, doubling over. “What could you possibly do to me, the Mighty Incredible Man, in your state? Beat me in cribbage?”

“I have made a pact with a powerful force, more powerful than you. It cost me my sight, mind and youth, but it was worth it to vanquish you.”

Incredible Man glared. “Nothing is more powerful than me.”

The old man grinned, and tapped the road. The symbols ignited with hellfire and shadows became thicker, enveloping him.

“Darath!” He strained his eyes, searching the darkness, finding nothing. “You run from a battle? Coward! How could you call yourself my rival when—”

The horizon, the overcast, the world itself came alive with blaring, jarring kaleidoscopic colors, blinding Incredible Man. He winced, rubbed his eyes, and opened them again. Before— above, maybe, for its body, its form, seemed to be both and below, to both his sides— he couldn’t understand, see, it clearly. A maelstrom, an enormous swirling vat, a maw with layers upon layers upon layers upon… of fleshy, blackened gums, lined with— teeming with things, people, creatures.

Incredible Man dropped to the ground like lead, collapsing to his knees. A numbness he had never felt before climbed up his legs, settling into his chest. His muscles hardened, became lumpy, then slowly they deflated, shrinking. His hair came undone, hung over his eyes, and turned gray.

The things inside rotated counterclockwise; arms, appendages raised, swaying like reeds underwater, reached out for help, Incredible Man knew, to be rescued from the hell they were a part of. There were torn crevices in their heads — or what could be considered heads — and a guttural moan echoed, droned, washed over Incredible Man’s hypersensitive hearing.

A brilliant white light appeared in the maw’s center, shooting shadows across the road and sand of the thousands of imprisoned souls. Incredible Man gripped his head, tears streaming down his face, blood trickling from his nose, eyes, and ears. His lungs burned and his heart pounded against his chest. A black seam appeared down the white light and separated to reveal— to reveal… Incredible Man didn’t know, couldn’t know, couldn’t decipher the hellish eye. He screamed nonsense, screamed words that made no sense, words that weren’t real.

His eyes widened, stretching to his hairline and jaw, and those holes in his skull were eyes no longer, but swirling vats, maelstroms of pain, lined with blackened, fleshy gums. They imprisoned thousands of screaming things, pleading for release, begging for the suffering to end.



















Writing Prompt #36 — Reading from Below
Prompt: When looking through the local library, you accidentally flip a switch and a book pops up. You grab it. It has no title, but you grab it and take it home. Little did you know, there was a title: The Soul Trap. When you get home, you open the book. 

It’s blank—

A sharp pain shot up my fingers, and I yanked them away from the book. The cream pages began to fill with red, thick words. I leaned forward to read them, but even closer I couldn’t understand what was written.

Must be some kind of dead language… Looks like Latin, but not. Wonder if the other pages are like this?

Gingerly, my fingers no longer hurting, I pinched the page’s corner and tried to turn it to discover it wouldn’t move. I tried to pull my hand away, but my fingers wouldn’t move, either.

“What the hell?”

I stood, the chair toppling over, and attempted to wrench my fingers free but they stuck.
The sharp pain returned in fiery waves, washing up my arms, settling over my chest, filling my stomach, and blossoming over my lower body. Sweat stood out on my forehead.

What’s happening?

The pages became white, the cream sinking away. The words became fuller, livelier, shaded with softer blacks and reds. Symbols and shapes appeared in the margins, twisting, weaving into one another, creating a tapestry of lines reminding me of Celtic designs. But these were off, different, as if their design were meant for someone or something else.

The book, the room, grew hazy. The hair in my eyes became a silvery blur, no longer brown. Veins enlarged, raised under my skin like piping.

I slumped against the table, hanging by my fingers attached to the book. My lungs flittered when I inhaled, coughing when I exhaled. The pounding inside my chest slowed. A numbness ran over my limbs, cooling the fire within. I took a gulp of air, and my fingers released as I crumbled onto the floor… 

I’m in a wet, pink endless place.

It’s like swimming in a pool of Vaseline. Everything is slick, warm, oddly soothing yet uncomfortable, oily, unable to see or feel or be clean. The holes in the sky are words, letters in which I can peer through like enormous sinkholes. Beyond is— was my room. The world trembles, there is thunder clashing somewhere in the distance. A giant eye appears in one of the holes.

The giant says something. Guttural, choking words. The eye gleams, and the world slams shut, filling with absolute darkness. There are pinpricks running up my feet, thin, webbed claws scratching my legs.

Here, I understand the words.




























Writing Prompt #43 — The Thing from Below
Prompt: You're skipping rocks across the Loch Ness in Scotland while on a trip, trying to see how far you can go. When you're on the verge of breaking your own personal record of 60+ skips, a bestial hand extends from out of the water and catches the stone.

I stumbled back, slipping on the wet stones scattered along the shore, and falling onto my backside. The gray and moldy green flesh hung from the skeletal body, like wet sheets on a line, rising from water, its hand still holding the stone.

I tried to find purchase on the shore, to crawl away from the thing now standing upon the murky water as if it were solid, but only found slick rocks and mud, nothing solid, dry.

It crossed the water, sending small ripples with each step. Its hand hung at its side, the other entirely gone, torn off by God only knew. My eyes widened. I opened my mouth to scream, but it was lodged in my throat, only a gasp escaping me.

It made no sound ascending the shore’s rise. It did not falter on the muck. The ragged clothing dripped with water reeking of rotten fish. I nearly vomited when it stood before me, its long, mangled dark hair covering its face.

It flicked the stone between my urine-soaked legs, and gurgled: “Keep it down — I am trying to sleep.”











Writing Prompt #44 — The Pact of a Whistler
Prompt: One of your coworkers whistles almost constantly. Everyone thinks he’s just trying to keep people from talking to him, but you’ve just found out his horrible secret… 

I sat across from Dave in the break room. He fidgeted with his fingers as he whistled. Perspiration covered him; the pits of white shirt soaked through.

“So how’s work, Dave?” I asked.

He shrugged, and quickly looked over his shoulder.

I glanced in the same direction. Nothing there. “So, uh… any plans for the weekend?”

Still whistling, he shook his head.

“The wife’s out of town with her friend,” I said, “so I’ll have the whole house to myself. I’m thinking of inviting some buddies from the department — Bill, Jack, and Michael — over Saturday night for drinks and cards. You want in?”

He locked eyes with me, his face reddening as began to perspire more. The melody from his paling lips never faltered. It seemed like he wanted to say more than just yes, like a man who wanted to scream for help.

Tabling the poker game, I asked. “Dave, are you in some trouble? Is that why you whistle all the time?”

He nodded.

“What kind of trouble?” I whispered, leaning forward. “Like money troubles or…”

He shook his head as his hand scrambled below the table, coming back up with a packet of sticky notes and a pen. Feverishly, he scribbled something, then slid the pad over.

Can’t talk. Can’t stop whistling. They’ll come.

“Uh, why can’t you stop whistling? Who’ll come?” I looked around the empty break room. “No one’s here but us — I wouldn’t tell anyone.”

He snatched the pad back, ripped the top one away, and wrote again.

Money problems. Bought some books from an old bookstore. Made a pact. Can’t stop whistling or they’ll come.

“Deal with who? The mob or what?”

He shook his head, tearing the note off, writing. The letters were thicker, larger, screaming.

THEY’LL COME IF I STOP. CAN’T STOP EVER.

“But Dave— c’mon, no one’s here. Whoever these guys are will never know. I’d never say anything, and even if you did come to the poker game, none of the guys would say a damn thing either — I swear it.”

His face scrunched up, tears seeping from his red-rimmed eyes. He groaned and in that second, that tiny fraction of time, the whistling stopped and the only sound in the break room was the refrigerator’s hum.

His eyes snapped open, and he screamed: “No!—” when the overhead lights died, throwing the room in darkness. There was scrambling on the floor, on the ceiling, as if dozens of rats scurried under the carpet and above the tiles. But it sounded more like hundreds of sheets of paper crinkling.

Dave coughed, hacking. He overturned the table, sending me jumping out of my seat, and stumbled into the darkness. The crinkling became overwhelming. I couldn’t think or hear my own shouts when I called for Dave. Then, like a bone cracking, the sound abruptly stopped and palpable silence filled the room. The lights flickered on, revealing the upturned table, my tipped over chair, and Dave’s empty, wrinkled clothes on the floor.








Writing Prompt #46 — The Better Things Come in Threes
Prompt: John got a new car; Tim got a new car. John got a pool put in; Tim made his indoors. John’s new entertainment system ran it all; Tim made sure his ran more. Then John summoned an eldritch horror from beyond.

Tim stood outside of John’s living room window, hidden by the tall hedges flanking its sides. He wrote down the size of John’s sigil on the floor; noted the type of chalk he used, the color of the candles, the book and what writing could be made out. The monstrosity he summoned, webbed in tattered, shimmering clothes: its approximate height, its features (deep, hollow eyes; no nose, nor mouth; thin, transparent appendages flowing like water).

Tim couldn’t hear what John was saying to the creature. Probably wishing for a bigger house or something — typical, he thought, scoffing.

When the creature vanished in a puff of kaleidoscopic smoke, and John began to mop up his ritual, Tim returned home, to prepare for his better ritual.

He purchased the highest quality of materials he could find in the city, even went so far as to buy even more than he saw John used. The more the better, he thought. Evening was settling in as he pulled into his driveway, the backseat brimming with bags. John was watering his freshly cut lawn, its ripe scent lingering in the air.

Tim opened the backseat door, and John called to him. “Whatchu’ been up to?”

He pulled five bags over his forearm, gripping a sixth. “Oh, nothing… Just doing some shopping, you know? What about you, buddy?”

“Nada, just hanging out. Sundays, am I right?” He turned off his hose, and coiled it on the ground. “Need any help with those?”

Tim had all twelve bags hanging from his arms and hands, and a thirteenth one dangling from his neck. A vein stood out of his sweaty temple, another rising from his jugular. He strained to shake his head. “Nope,” he spat, kicking the car door closed. “I got it — I’m a one trip man.”

John laughed. “Yeah, me too — I remember one time I carried in twenty bags at once! Martha was impressed.”

What a damn liar.

“Oh, wow, nice!” Tim said, struggling to get the keys from his pocket. When he finally did, he fell against the front door, shoving the key into the knob, unlocking it. He fell through the doorway, spilling the bags’ contents onto the floor. Before John could run over and help, he rolled over, and heeled the door shut. “Have a good night, John!” Jackass.

His sigil was larger; more detailed. There were double the candles and incense, their colors deeper. He purchased three leather bound tomes that spoke of strange things Tim could hardly understand, but he could recite them, that’s all that mattered. If John can summon one thing, I can do three.

He flipped off the lights, and lit the candles, their dim glow illuminating the room. Tim sat before the books, and read one passage from each at a time, until all three had been read. A wind blew through the house, extinguishing the candles, and thick darkness fell over Tim.

“Hello?” he said, dumbly.

The chalk drawn sigil illuminated violet and pink, green and blue, colors ebbing and flowing like the tide. They began strobing until the colors mixed, becoming a blinding white. Tim winced, covering his eyes with his arm, until it dimmed. When he put his arm down, opening his eyes, three children stood before him.

They shared the same gray-blue tinged flesh; the seaweed-like hair; the bloated fingers and shoeless feet, but each had one distinctive feature. One was missing eyes, gouged out, oozing black tar; one was missing a mouth, nothing but a thin, fleshly line crudely patched with staples and stitches; and the last was missing ears, the gaping holes on the sides of its head were connected, and when it turned, Tim saw the wall behind it, through it.

“You summon the Three,” the one with no ears gurgled.

“What do you seek?” the one with no eyes finished.

“I, uh… I don’t know…”

“Only one who wants something summons the Three,” a voice said from somewhere above him, but when Tim looked, there was only the ceiling.

“If one does not have wants and summons the Three,” no-ears said.

“Then thee will be a part of the Three,” no-eyes followed.

“You’ll take me… if I don’t want anything?” Tim said, his voice trembling.

“Yes,” the voice said.

“Then, I… uh, want to have more than John— John Black, my neighbor.”

“Are you certain?” the voice asked.

Tim nodded his head.

“Then—” no-ears said.

“—it is—” no-eyes continued.

“—done.” the voice finished.

In a flash of checkered smoke, the Three vanished, taking along with it the chalk drawn sigil, the candles, even the books. Tim was now alone in the empty room, unsure of what to do. He stood, walked around the house, finding everything the same.

“What a joke,” he whispered, coming to his bedroom. He flipped on the light and gasped. This one was the one thing John did not, could never have— his house couldn’t fit it.

The room was the size of his entire downstairs. His bed was as big as a car; the TV hanging on the wall was wide, flat, high-def. He entered the room, and the satin sheets rippled as if something scurried underneath, then a blonde woman’s head popped out from the top. Then another, another, another… There were at least a dozen beautiful women in the — his — bed, and from where Tim stood, he saw none of them wearing clothes.

Oh sweet Jesus.

He stumbled towards the bed, toppled onto it, and crawled to them. His teary eyes wide, his open mouth grinning.

Oh sweet Jesus.

His tingling fingers gripped the end of the sheet, pulled it away—

small, bloated bodies, tinged blue and green—

He looked at their faces to find gouging eyes; sewn smiles; gaping holes where ears should be.

“You wanted more than he—” a voice said from above.

“—and now you do—” one of no-ear’d heads continued.

“—for we’re certain that he does not have the Three,” one of the no-eyes finished.





















Writing Prompt #48 — From One Game to the Next
Prompt: Even after fixing it up, it’s very complicated living in a house that was the site of a survival horror game. 

“Get off my damn lawn!” Tom shouted at the people standing outside in his freshly cut yard. “It’s six in the morning! Don’t you people sleep?” They ignored him, as they took pictures of his home with their phones and cameras, laughing and conversing.

He slammed the door, and stomped into the kitchen.

“Out there again?” Sam, his wife, said.

He groaned, sitting down to his breakfast.

“I’m sorry dear, but what did you expect?”

He stopped chewing his eggs, looked up. “I don’t know Sammy, maybe some damn decency. The house doesn’t even look like it did before: we replaced the walls, the paint, even the polish on the floors. The yard is cut, the roof has new shingles, we replaced the siding with a different color, everything!” He slammed his fist on the table, rattling the dishes. “But these damn people and their morbid curiosity about a fucking game.”

She shrugged, took a sip from her split coffee, and bit into a slice of toast. “What can you do about it, honey? We don’t have enough money to move, and with October next month, I’d guess we’ll have even more people outside. I think you might just have to deal with it for the next couple of years until we can afford a new home.”

Tom glanced over his shoulder at the basement door. Beyond the door and down the stairs were his woodworking tools, some professional: surface planter, band saw, drill press, others his own, though more crude, like his razor saw and fire ax. He smiled, turning back to his wife.

“I think this October, we will start our own game.”





Writing Prompt #50 — A Place Made from Coral and Sand
Prompt: Deep in the ocean where darkness reigns, life begins to mirror the surface. In the future, A submarine is built powerful enough to explore those depths. As a member of the crew, you experience firsthand what that kind of environment does to a civilization.

Captain Wolf and I stood at the large, convex window at the sub’s southern end. The window was shielded by thin, bluish gray metal, serving as a curtain between the sea-life and us. Although I had been serving Captain Wolf and his ship for many years, I still felt unease knowing that only glass separated me from life and death.

“Michael?” the Captain said, breaking me from daydream.

“Yes, yes,” I said, “sorry sir, continue.”

He walked around me to the square monitor by the window. He stood on his toes, pressed one of the dozen black buttons flanking the monitor, and the screen came to life. I walked over to him; hands joined behind my back.

“Today I will show you something no one has seen.” He pressed another button. A dull metallic sound issued near the window. He was opening the curtains. “Look,” he nodded to the window with his pronounced chin, “what do you see?”

I glanced, it was as though I was staring into space and not the seabed. “Blackness, sir.”
“That’s correct blackness. It’s so dark in this part of the ocean that not even our eyes can decipher anything. Now what if I told you, Michael, that there are things living in that darkness? Amphibian life, ever evolving, growing similar and similar to on-shore life.”

I shifted my stance. “Like, humans, sir?”

“Nearly. Now look, on the screen.”

The monitor came to life with an electric green hue. Night vision was on. There were outlines of things in speckled white, but they were difficult to distinguish. Some figures had the shape of fish — fins, bulbous eyes, gaping mouths — but others were straight, as though they were standing, and some possessed two long, thin limbs that could’ve been arms or legs...

“Down here, there’s no light, as you can see. These species have evolved without light, wouldn’t even know what it was if they saw it, but from what I was able to gather, light can damage them severely.”

“Is that why you didn't turn on the search lights, sir?”

“Precisely.

“What you’re seeing on the screen is the best we’ve been able to capture. Night vision, even in this day in age, is very rudimentary in what we’re trying to accomplish, but…” He looked at the screen, seemingly lost in his thoughts.

“But sir?”

He shook his head. “Yes, sorry, but there have been advancements. Research, mostly theories and hypotheses, has been made. A group of oceanographers and marine biologists believe that these species can’t reflect light, like they’re air with a very, very thin frame... But they believe UV light will be able to refract within their bodies and reveal more of them. Moreover, the research has developed a device that shoots UV lights in a certain way — a certain ‘pattern,’ I was told — that would enter the figures without harm, revealing them to us. It’s in alpha stages currently, but I was able to procure a prototype for this voyage.” Captain Wolf pressed a black button, the metal curtains closed. He flicked a switch and the overhead lights dimmed. “Are you ready, Michael?”

I nodded, although he wasn’t facing me.

“Good, good.” He adjusted a dial near the bottom of the monitor, another near the top right corner, then pressed a green button to the left. The image of the screen flickered from electric green and white outlines to velvety purple with white outlines, then a deeper purple, almost black, with even brighter outlines. The screen flickered momentarily, then settled.

“Jesus,” I gasped.

“You see them?” he whispered.

“Yes— yes,” I said, whispering, too. “I see them... sir.”

There were upright moving figures with protruding back fins. There were ones with two arms and two legs, walking across the sands of the ocean floor. Some had human-shaped heads with two eyes, but with gaping, amphibious mouths; some had fins instead of arms but two legs; some reversed. Their skin was pale, ghostly, but I wasn’t certain if it was from the device or it was their true colors. Beyond the moving figures were crumbling structures made from must’ve been coral and sand; tall, spiraling like a seashell, towards the lighter seas above. The figures moved and swam from one low structure to the other, some venturing away towards the tall buildings in the distance.

A taller figure, one with bulging eyes from a human-shaped skull stopped mid-stride. It turned towards us.

“Sir?”

“Yes?” he said, his jaw slack, eyes wide with wonder.

“Can they see us?”

“They can’t see, at least from what the scientists told me. It’s so dark that they don’t need eyes. They use sonar, like dolphins.”

Another figure stopped, turned. A shorter one this time, with stout legs and two, webbed fins where its arms would be.

“Is it possible, sir, that our ship can create a sound they would be able to identify?”

He shook his head. “I doubt it and, even if it did, they would ignore us. We’re just onlookers, no importance to them.”

More and more figures stopped and faced us, as if peering through the monitor at the Captain and me. My hands became cold, clammy, and an unsettling feeling of unease fell over me. “Sir, you think we should kill the light and head back to base?”

“No,” he said, hushed, “not yet, Michael... Not just yet.”

The tall figure began walking towards the sub. Others trailed behind, forming a wall of deformed, amphibious creatures. I hesitantly took a step back. Even if they did come near the sub, they couldn’t pierce metal — they were fish, after all. I glanced at the window, the curtain was still drawn, then back to the monitor that flickered from purple, to black, to green, to black again.

“What the hell is going on?” the Captain said, began adjusting dials, pressing buttons.

I looked at the window again.

There were dull noises coming from somewhere in the sub; normal things to hear: oxygen adjusting, metal expanding, settling.

“Damnit! Work!” The Captain shouted as he pounded on the buttons.

The curtains began to open. “Sir?”

He didn’t hear me over his shouting. The curtains were parting faster than usual, as if the gears were working double time. “Sir!”

The Captain shouted, “What?”

“Did you open the metal shield?”

“No, no, I don’t think, but maybe,” he said, walking over to me, the shield now entirely open.
I couldn’t see anything but blackness.

Then something clinked against the glass.

Then, again.

Then a fissure shot across the window.

“Run! Run Michael!” The Captain screamed, grabbing my shoulder, forcing me to turn. My feet wouldn’t budge, my legs numb. I stood stupefied by the window.

Another fissure crossed the glass, shooting off from the previous one.

The emergency lights turned on, flaring red throughout the ship. The automatic system protecting the rest of the crew kicked on, the metal doors of the room clanged closed, sealed airtight.

I heard the Captain hammering on the steel door.

A spider webbing of fissures spread across the entire window.

Water spurted, trickling in through one of them.

“Sweet Jesus—”

The window gave way, glass and dark water flooding the room, red flashing lights reflecting within. Things moved around me, grasped me, reached past me to the Captain, but I couldn’t see anything, couldn’t see what must’ve been the pale species coming in like pillagers. Through the commotion, I thought I heard Captain Wolf’s gargled scream, but soon after, I fell unconscious.

I awoke sometime later, in a cot in one of the small rooms of the sub. I wore different clothes, and my head was shaved. A nurse sat on a stool in the corner, and she explained that my hair had withered and grayed, either from fear or being touched by one of those things.

Before I could ask, she went on: “By the time the window had self-sealed, and the water was pumped out, we couldn’t find Captain Wolf anywhere, even out on the seabed.”

I wanted to ask her why he was taken and not me, but I knew she wouldn’t know anything more than I did. All I could do was smile weakly, thank her, and fall back asleep. In a dream, pale figures listlessly walked across the dark sands, to sand huts and coral structures, but one stopped and looked at me and he had the Captain’s eyes.
























Writing Prompt #54 — My Prom Date’s Parents
Prompt: It’s prom night and you arrive at your high school sweethearts home to pick them up. You’re also meeting their parents for the first time, who turn out to be a pair of ancient demigods masquerading as a suburban couple raising a mortal child.

“Oh, shoot, sorry babe, but I forgot something upstairs,” my prom date said, running back upstairs. I stood at the doorway, fidgeting with my fingers, left with her parents.

“Why don’t you come sit in the living room for a bit?” Her dad asked, waving his hand towards the living room.

“Uh,” I said, “yeah, sure, okay.”

I followed them into the room. There were two loveseats facing each other, a glass coffee table in the center, and a fireplace to the side. A large mirror hung above the mantle, candles in golden holders on each side. I sat down, and they sat on the opposite couch.

Her dad’s hand rested on her mom’s thigh; her arm coiled around his.

“So,” he said, “what’s the plan for tonight?”

I shifted in my seat, wiped my forehead. “I, uh, the dance, then probably out to eat.”

“Anything else?”

“No, nothing else.” I shook my head, putting my hands in my pockets, feeling the foil of the unwrapped condom at the bottom.

“Good, good.” He nodded.

I glanced at the table, the soft gray carpet, the red brick fireplace, anything that wasn’t her parents whose eyes seemed to never leave me. In the mirror—

What the fuck?

Sitting where her parents were… Weren’t human… Weren’t people.

I looked at them, then the mirror, then them again. Sweat streamed from under my arms.
In the mirror was nothing I’d ever seen… Crimson reptilian skin covering their bodies… Pronged, curling horns jutting from their foreheads… Hollow, dark holes with smoldering eyes… Sharp, webbed hands… They each had a long-pointed tail, twisting around the back of the couch… 

“You see our true form, don’t you?” her mom asked.

“I, uh—a—” I faced her. She was smiling.

“It’s fine, it’s fine. We know you can see it. We showed you.”

Her dad patted her thigh. “Yes, and we could show you even more, if we desired, but I don’t think that’s necessary, do you?”

I shook my head, removing my hands from my pockets, placing them cupped on my lap.

“Good, good. So, our daughter, our beloved daughter, will be home right after dinner, is that right?”

I nodded.

“That’s what we thought.”

“Found it!” I heard my date shout as she ran downstairs. She held her phone in the air. “Must’ve fell under my bed!” As she came into the living room, I jumped up, grabbed her hand, and strode to the front door.

“Hey, hold on,” she said, “we still have to get our picture taken.”

“Yes,” I heard her mom say, “a picture.”

I inhaled, closed my eyes, prayed, then turned around, and opened them, forcing a smile. Her father stood next to her mom as she held out a camera. “Say cheese!”

Right before the flash, I saw them, I saw what they were. Both had a lipless smile, revealing jagged, crude teeth coated in black blood. Her father’s brow furrowed, his eyes glowing brighter, and a thought — not my own — popped in my head.

Home after dinner.

Writing Prompt #58 — The Eye of Cthulhu
Prompt: In 2019 scientists fawned over themselves after photographing a black hole for the first time. Unfortunately, they were wrong, it wasn't a black hole at all. It was an eye. Cthulhu has awakened. 

Before the oceans rose and flooded the earth, before the Old Ones clawed and crawled from the depths of silt and sand, and ravaged those who walked the earth; before the sky turned kaleidoscopic hues of unimaginable colors and clouds melted like wax, and everything that we once held as fact and logic vanished in a moment... We believed that humans had made a massive step in knowing the vast unknown surrounding the planet.

We thought that single photo of a black hole, some odd light years away, was our step to learning... But what we learned was not the image of a black hole, no, for it was an imprint of something far more unknown, something far more uncaring, something far closer to us than we imagined... What we didn’t learn was after the photo of what we believed to be the black hole had been taken, was that the black hole blinked, like an eye... The image we took awoke the one who dwelled in the watery city of R’lyeh, the one who died but continued to dream, with eyes open, who waited to be stirred and finally was.





















Writing Prompt #61 — Filling in the Memories
Prompt: An angry knock on your door has you peek out of the mail slot to see an unfamiliar person. “I am sorry, do I know you?” They stare at you angrily. “How many more times are they going to wipe your mind?”

“What do you mean they wiped my mind?” I asked, still hunched over, peering through the mail slot at a pair of oddly familiar teal eyes.

“Ugh, just— just can you open the damn door? My back's hurting like a bitch,” the man spat.
I straightened, and opened the door a sliver, keeping the chain lock in place. The man stood, hissing, rubbing his lower back. He wore a black overcoat with a stained white t-shirt underneath, and a pair of faded blue jeans. His ruffled hair was dirty blonde.

“Thanks,” he said and tried to push open the door to find it still locked. “C'mon, seriously? We’ve known each other for years and you still can't remember who I am?”

My grip on the doorknob tightened. “Years? I've never seen you before.”

“Ah shit, they musta’ got you good this time,” he scratched his stubbled cheek, “it’s me, Chuck. We go way back, elementary school and all that. We were in Mrs. Jowls class together, English, yeah? Double-dated for prom? Joined that shit-show of a ‘club’ after high school, the fuckers who wiped your memory.”

Images flashed through my mind. Mrs. Jowls with her beaked nose, the green chalkboard written on by someone he knew... Prom, his father’s suit because they couldn't afford to rent one, his date’s bright blue dress, her friend’s bright pink and her date with a white bow tie... The club... The headquarters out in the abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town... The rusted walls, the coppery smell when they lit fires... The black robes and golden embroidered symbols...

“Chuck?” I whispered.

“Yep, there you go... Comin’ all back to you now, isn’t it?” He grinned, revealing yellowed teeth.

I shook my head as I undid the chain lock and allowed him in. I stepped away and sunk into the couch, as he peeked outside, shut the door, and locked it. “Got anything to drink?” he asked, striding to the kitchen.

I waved my hand towards the fridge. “Yeah, juice, soda, iced coffee…”

I heard him rummage in the fridge, then he came back with a bottle of orange juice.

“So,” he said before taking a drink, “remember anything else?”

The absolute darkness in the warehouse... The machine in the center, lit by an overhead light... People sitting in it... Wires and pads attached to their temples, their chest, some on their groin... Screaming, blood, ghost-like tendrils seeping from eyes...

I shook my head. “Some, but not everything…”

He sat on the chair to the side, set the drink down next to the stack of coasters on the coffee table. “Yeah, that happens, bastards just keep doin’ it.”

“Doing what?”

“Using our fucking brains,” he poked his temple, “to summon some asshole from who-cares-Ville in space.”

“To do... What?”

He wiped his lips after taking a drink. “I don't fucking know. Destroy the planet? Make their little dicks bigger? Does it matter, really?”

I rubbed the crook of my nose. “I guess, it doesn’t.”

“But you better go get something to eat there bud,” Chuck said, finishing off his OJ.
“Why?”

“Because they keep fuckin’ with us, the ones who got out of that shit-fuck club. Drugging us in our food, taking us back to that shit-hole warehouse, using our minds and wiping them in the process. Every time it happens, little by little, it’s likely we won’t remember anything anymore. I used to be able to remember what my first girlfriend’s tits looked like, what they felt like, but now— fuck, nothing, nada... I can't even remember her damn name or face. Shit’s fucked, really.”

‘But... but—” I closed my eyes and shook my head. “What’s that have to do with me?”
“Jesus Christ, they really did a number on you. It has to do you with your dumb ass because we’re the last two who even remembers the warehouse, the club, all of that shit. They got enough of our mind energy. The thing they have been trying to summon is on its way, and we’re the only two who can actually do something about it.”

It felt like someone had stepped on my chest. I sat back into the couch, sighing. I knew what he was going to say before he did.

“So we’re going to go stop them, now go get some food in your tummy, drink some of that horrible vanilla ice coffee I saw in the fridge, and let’s go. The cars running out back, filled to the teeth with shit I got from some pyro-junkie yesterday.” I didn’t hear him get up, but I felt him slap my knee. “C’mon, get up, we don’t got fucking time daydreaming.”

I opened my eyes and inhaled deeply, nodded. “Fine, I’ll come, but don’t slap me again.”

He grinned. “Deal, now let’s go burn some shit.”


























Writing Prompt #67 — Unstable Foundation
Prompt: You are sent to the Moon as part of a crew to start the construction of humanity's first moon base. Halfway through your stay there, you realize one if your crew member went missing.

There was a crew before us. Four men, one woman. They were meant to lay the foundation of the base, but soon after their arrival HQ lost contact with them, one by one. HQ had cameras installed there long before crews were sent up, but they were old, monochrome; not much could be made out. One minute they were there, shoveling moon sand, carrying bags of cement, doing the work; the next they weren’t. It was as though something plucked them out from space.

The base needed built and HQ sure as hell weren’t going to wait out to figure out what happened. Accidents happen. People forget to refill their O2 tanks and suffocate, some even forget where they’re at and get lost. They became just another statistic. After a while, HQ decided to send another crew up. My crew.

We were only three guys. Jerry, Chad, and me, Michael. Our ship landed near the last crew’s. It stood like a tombstone, looming over the gray landscape. Jerry went to check their ship, while Chad and I went to the worksite. They made a lot of progress. Bags of cement and jugs of water still sat in the gray sand nearby, and long steel poles, gleaming under our flashlights, lay out forming the skeleton of the base. The foundation was solid, though only partially complete… There were weird markings across it, though, like some sort of bird had crossed it before it dried. Could’ve been a mistake by the crew, but it didn’t really matter at the end of the day.

“Jerry, how’s the ship?” I asked via the short-wave intercom. After no response, Chad said: “Hey, Jerry, everything okay in there?”

We turned and stared at the looming ship. It wasn’t large. A normal landing ship. One level. No artificial gravity. Jerry couldn’t have gotten lost getting to the ship, or somehow fell inside and hurt himself.

I looked to Chad, he shrugged, then over the flat, gray landscape, then the ship. The freeze-dried food hardened in my stomach. “Jerry,” I said into the intercom, “we’re coming to the ship.”

Chad went in first and as soon as he was inside: “Michael, get in here.”

I quickly climbed the small ladder inside and once through the portal, I understood why Chad sounded urgent. I stopped midway in. The walls, ceiling, floor were covered in dark gray etchings of long, scratchy words. It wasn’t English — it wasn’t any language I had ever seen. I tried to sound out the ones there were most English-like, but it only made my temples throb. The scratchy language covered the entirety of the hull, swirling until there wasn’t any empty space left.

Chad looked at me as I stood. “What do you think this is?”

“I don’t know... It’d guess it’s old, whatever it is. Look, some of the scratches are rusted.”

“That doesn’t make sense — this ship hasn’t been here that long. How could it be rusted?” Chad scratched one of the coppery patches. It flaked away, revealing smooth steel underneath. He stumbled, the back of his helmet hitting off the low ceiling. “Shit, that’s not rust! It’s dried blood!”

“Let’s return to the ship. HQ had to know about this.” I slipped as I hurriedly exited the ship, and fell face-first from the top of the ladder. Gray tufts enclosed around me. “Shit, Chad, can you help me up?”

No response.

“Chad?”

I scrambled around, and crawled to the ladder, pulled myself up to my feet. Through the open hatch, the ship was empty. “Chad?” I said once more… When I received no response, I ran to our ship and sealed the door.

As I opened a long-wave relay to HQ, I stared out the small port window.

“HQ, this is Michael Browny of US-SKEW 2, over. Repeat. This is Michael Browny of US-SKEW 2, over. Chad Young and Jerry York have disappeared, over. Chad Young and Jerry York have disappeared.”

It would take over fifteen minutes for HQ to receive the relay. I waited, peering outside.

Impressions appeared in the sand, like bird’s feet coming down before taking flight again. But there weren’t bodies, there wasn’t anything, an invisible thing hopping across the land. One after another until they stopped before the ship’s ladder. Heat sweltered in my suit, and sweat stung my eyes. There was scratching coming from above and behind. I spun to find scratch words being written within the hull, rising from steel as though water.

I looked outside again, quick, catching a glimpse of a faint form. Needle-thin arms, legs; tattered cloth hung over gnarled, gray flesh, a beaked head sticking out from beneath a hood covered in scratchy words. Then it was gone, vanishing into space. The moon wasn’t inhabited as we were led to believe.

“Abandon the mission, US-SKEW 2,” HQ’s voice said over the intercom, “Abandon the mission, over.”

Automatically, instinctively, I began flipping switches and pressing buttons. The ship’s hum rattled my brain. I refused to look outside anymore, refused to stare at the words etched into metal. The ship rose into the blackness of space towards home… 

What I realized as the ship left the moon’s orbit, was that the scratchy words weren’t only on the ship but carved into my suit. And, horrifyingly, I wondered if once I removed my suit, would they be written on my flesh, too?



























Writing Prompt #70 — In the Shadows of Stars
Prompt: You meet the girl of your dreams online. But all is not what it seems. A romantic tale soon becomes a horror story.

She was as beautiful in person as she was online, though more talkative online than at the restaurant. She had chestnut hair, brown eyes, a small, cute nose, and thin but kissable lips. She was everything I wanted in a partner… But something was off, something wasn’t right. When she laughed I couldn’t see her teeth, and when she widened her eyes it was as if I were looking into an empty sky. The dimples I initially loved seemed to take too long to slunk back into her skin, and the way her fingers seemed to elongate as they touched my arm made my skin crawl.

Before I had realized, two hours had passed and dinner was over. I paid, leaving a modest tip, and walked with her outside. The cold breeze felt good and I unbuttoned my overcoat to let more in. She stood idly, glancing down the street, the sky, the wind blowing the hem of her floral dress around her legs.

“So,” I said, “what do you want to do now?”

She faced me, eyes matching the blackness above. Her pupils encompassed everything, and a needle-thin white ring raised from the darkness. She placed her hand onto my shoulder and her fingers descended like growing vines, wrapping around my bicep, tightening until my arm went numb. Her lips stretched to her endless eyes, and a faint noise, as though someone screamed from the bottom of a well, entered my mind. She whispered like mist.

“Come back to my place.”

I swallowed the lump in my throat, licked my dry lips. “Where’s that?”

She looked up. “In the shadows of stars.”

I tried to break from her grip, but she pressed herself against me, her other arm wrapping around my waist, her talons digging into my back, probing my spine. Her hair rippled like water, and this close, the smell of smoke clogged my nose. She leaned in, said softly into my ear, “I won’t take no for an answer.”





Writing Prompt #72 — The Discovery of the Sided Sphere
Prompt: You are an explorer and you and your team just found a jungle with temples older than civilization and strange artifacts

The dark gray temples were cyclopean in nature, yet rounded and jutting in certain areas, like an expanded balloon. Some possessed needle-thin doorways into narrow hallways, and we weren't able to squeeze through. Crude, continuous — what we believed to be — words were scrawled around each temple, seamlessly flowing from one word to the next until its weathered turret was reached.

A larger temple stood in the center of the smaller ones, giving enough space for at least one of our crew to enter. I was chosen because I was first to stumble upon the temples, but truly, I believed I was the scapegoat and fear played a larger role than the crew would admit.

If I hadn’t a torch, I would’ve been stumbling in absolute darkness. The walls were covered in the same scrawl as the exterior, but the words were long, their bottoms reaching the stone floor. The narrow corridor began to descend and veer west, east, west, then north. The jungle’s warmth left me as sweat cooled on my brow.

A low, small room was at the end of the hallway. I hunched under the doorframe, and came to a small stone pillar, a shape with numberless sides placed atop. It looked like a sphere, but it wasn't quite round but round still. Each side gleamed with a different color under torchlight, creating a wave of kaleidoscopic colors flowing over its frame. I was certain any museum would pay an exuberant amount for it.

I removed a handkerchief from my pocket, covered my hand, and slowly reached for it.
When I touched the sphere an overwhelming burning sprung up my arm, exploding in my chest. I stumbled back, gasping for air, staring at my hand to find a dark outline of my hand burnt into the handkerchief. I looked at the sphere, removed my jacket, and wrapped it tightly around my hand, and reached for the sphere once more.

The burning was subtle, but I managed to raise it into the air. My skin prickled, and I smelled burnt hair. I ran from the room, back into the corridors; south, east, west, east. Faint, evening light fell through the doorway, and I briefly wondered how much time had passed since I entered. The burning increased, and my chest tightened. I slid through the portal and into the open air, smiling, holding the relic.

My crew was gone, only their equipment remained, scattered upon the ground. I shouted for them, receiving no response. I crouched next to a bag of supplies, finding it still full. The burning was paramount, as if I held the bottom of a kettle freshly off the stove. I hissed as I let it drop to the ground, where grass instantly burned and charred around it. As I returned to the supplies, a blinding light blared from the sphere, casting the clearing, temples, sky into a white light.

I turned— The scrawl on the temples glowed violet. A shimmering liquid oozed, seeping from the line, streaming down the stone sides, melting over the grass, and pooling beneath the sphere. The sphere glowed violet, then a deep purple.

Like a volcano, a beam of purple light erupted from the sphere's top and injected into the now night sky.

I looked up.

A constellation formed in the darkness, in the shape of the sphere. The insides glowed purple, appearing like melting max. Long fingers pushed through, extending, reaching; a thin gray arm followed; another hand, another arm; then an oval, craggy face speckled with kaleidoscopic, gleaming eyes.

Not only did my mouth scream when I sprinted into the jungle, but my mind, too. Screaming, relentlessly: What I have released onto the world?




















Writing Prompt #76 — A Hunter’s Last Meal
Prompt: You are tired… dead tired… so tired your bones ache and you can feel sleep embracing you even as you are standing in front of the fire. The rain and rocky terrain took their toll on you as you stalked your dinner through the forest all day. Suddenly you hear a noise that rouses you.

Before I can reach for the rifle lying in the grass, I hear a familiar, metallic click behind me.

“Don’t bother,” a woman’s voice says, “you’ll be dead before you can touch it.”

The small fire gives the clearing a warm glow. The blood and gristle coated metal plate on the ground gleams dully. Kindle snaps and pops. Rain spits on the overhead canopies.

I’m too tired to shift and face the woman, too tired to bother raising my hands from my lap. Perhaps I’m getting too old? Perhaps it’s time to be put down anyway?

There’s footsteps and the woman comes into view, holding a hunting rifle awkwardly with trembling hands. It’s too long for her small body. There’s tears in her eyes, and her lips are firm, tight, and her damp clothes are so black they almost melt into the shadows.

“How’d you find me?” I ask, though I probably already know.

“Followed you,” she nods towards the south, where miles of evergreens lay, “from the road.”

I wonder how long she had been doing that. Days? Probably.

“I saw your handy work left in the woods,” she sniffs, wipes her nose on her shoulder. “Disgusting.”

I laugh. “It’s something to have someone follow you, point a rifle at you, and insult your work.”
“Work? You call that your work?”

I nod. “What else would you call it? It’s not a hobby, or a job, or a career. It’s my work — it’s in my blood, in my bones.”

Fresh tears spill down her face, she grimaces. The rifle’s barrel wavers. “They're just—”

“Just what?” I spit, straightening, adjusting my aching shoulders. “They’re meant to be hunted, meant to be killed and stripped and eaten. What makes them so different, so special? They bleed, die all the same.”

She raises the rifle quickly, the barrel pointed directly at my shallow chest. “No, they aren’t, they’re more than that you sick bastard!”

I shake my head, run my tongue over my teeth, remembering the way my last meal tasted. I smile.

“If you’re going to do it, just do it,” I say.

She steps forward, digging the barrel into my sternum, pushing deep against bone. Even though she’s not near the heart, it’ll be fatal. She deeply inhales, exhales.

“The last one will be your last you sick-fuck,” she hisses. “I know you killed my son and fucking ate him, just before I showed up.”

She pulls the trigger.
























Writing Prompt #79 — The Ever-Changing Woman
Prompt: As you’re returning to port you see a woman on island needing rescue. Her motorboat is old but she appears to have been there only a few days. You take her aboard and you realize while talking to the crew everyone describes her in radically different ways varying in height, weight, race, etc.

“Aye, that stowaway is fat for my likings, but she has nice, almond eyes,” Tommy says, standing out on the forward by the railing.

“Fat? What do you mean, fat? She has a body like that of cloth on a wire, but her hair, like seaweed, stinks of it, and skin like mildew, too,” Henry replies.

I wonder who they’re talking about, certainly not the woman we retrieved from that desolate island, who now naps in my cabin. I pass the forward, open the door to the narrow bunk-lined corridor, enter the mess hall. Some of the crew sit around the stained, rickety table, playing cards and sipping from their canteens. Alcohol or not, it matters naught; our work’s done, all that’s left is the voyage home. They snicker and scowl, speaking about the same woman they others were.

“Plump and ripe and tan, like an orange just waiting to be bitten into,” Gregory says.

“Sinewy and thin, dark, too, jerky set out too long,” Chester says, grimacing, “not even salt would help the taste. And, her legs, far too short, she could barely reach my waist even if she stood on her toes.”

“Are you two fools? Mad? Have scurvy?” Lyle pipes in. “She's a goddess; tall; long, brown hair; endless ivory legs, a bust that's not too large, nor small; perfect cups in which to hold.”

I can’t keep my mouth shut any longer. “Who are you bloody fools speaking about? You and the others all speak of someone, but who?”

“Are you serious, Captain?” Chester asks. “You mad, too?”

They all stare at me.

“We’re speaking about that doll you pulled up not an hour ago,” Gregory says, smirking. “A plump, delicious fruit in which to suckle.”

They laugh, except for Lyle, who shakes his head. “A goddess she is,” he mumbles.
“If you are speaking about the same woman, then why are you fools seeing all sorts of things? I only brought up one woman, not a dozen.”

They fall in silence, and return to their game.

I left them to it, and return to my cabin. I knock before entering. It might be my ship, but she is a lady.

“Come in,” she says.

I enter, closing the door behind me. She sits on my bed with her pale, thin legs drawn beneath a white gown. Her blonde hair is tied back in a tail, and her hands together in her lap. When she looks at me, her blue eyes gleam under the sunlight coming in through the port window.

“May I sit?” I ask, standing near the bed.

She nods.

I shake my head, smirking. “I'm sorry lady, but I must ask you a question.”

She turns her head, facing me. “What is it, Captain?”

“The men — they believe your appearance changes.”

She smiles. “What do you mean?”

I laugh. “Well, they all see something different when they see you. Some say you're as fat as a pig, others say a frail as a scarecrow, and some think you're ripe as a plum. I see none of those things. I see a pale, blonde woman with blue eyes.”

She giggles, covering her mouth, and with her other, places it on my hand, says: “Well, they ought to see those things, for I am ever-changing.”

My mouth becomes dry. I lick my lips. “What?”

“Why do you think I was on that island, Captain? Why do you think that motorboat was so utterly rusted, aged eons? I was there longer than all the years of the men on this ship.”
“But—” I start to say, but dizziness overcomes me. I grip the edge of the bed to keep myself from falling back.

“You see what you truly want to see. There’s others, like me, too, out there in the world. We’re a race, an old, old race, traveled here ages ago. I was captured, foolishly, by jealous, hatred-fueled men and tied to that motorboat, tampered with to go without a Captain, and left to die at sea. But, as you know, I did not.”

My hands go numb. The world tilts, shifts. I stare at the ceiling. My temples throb as I try to make sense of her strange story, try to understand what’s happening.

She leans over me, strands of blonde hair dangling and framing her face. “Our touch is poisonous to you folk, see? That’s why I was tied to that ship. Too many men angry that they can’t have what they like. Look, not touch.” She smiles. “Now, before the darkness comes, would you like to see my true form? I could at least grant you that for rescuing me.”

I open my mouth, but only a gargle escapes me. My heart slows, my lungs feel like they are filling with tar. I cough and red specks splash her face. I close my eyes, open them and God— Flesh rippling like water; wide, misshapen hollow eyes burning like fire pits; hair sprouting from the sides of her head, connecting to bulbous things protruding from her shoulders. She opens the lipless seam under two slits, revealing a darkness that not even a starless night possesses. I hear something like wind, something like screaming, drift from the bottomless hole within her. She closes her mouth, and smiles.

“Now, succumb to the darkness, Captain,” she says with a guttural croak.

My eyes close.
















Writing Prompt #85 — Disrespecting the Deceased
Prompt: All the buried bodies of the deceased slowly sink to the center of the earth and form a large monster that emerges once every year. It gets stronger for everybody it adds to itself and it hunts those who have disrespect the dead.

The amber glow of the boys’ cigarettes softly illuminated the dewy grass and nearby tombstones. Tommy sat on a Mrs. Grawood, Henry leaned against a pillar of granite dedicated to a war hero with a name they couldn’t pronounce, and Mike stood with his foot flat on a tombstone he had just recently knocked over.

“I don’t know why you do that, Mike,” Tommy said to Mike, who stood with his back to them. Tommy took a drag, exhaled smoke through his nose.

Mike blew smoke from his pursed lips. “Because they’re just rocks.”

“But” Harry said, pointing his cigarette, “people pay for them. They’re important.”

Mike whipped around to Harry and Tommy. “And look who’s fucking talking? You both are using them as seats.”

“Yeah but,” Tommy said, “we’re not destroying them. We have at least some respect.” 

“Who cares?” Mike said, turning back around, taking a puff, and flicking the ash away. “It’s not like they care anyway. Their rich families will just fix it or get them a new one. Ain’t that right,” he moved his foot and bent over, “Mr. Random? Mr. Random. That’s your name? Sweet Jesus.” He straightened and glanced at his friends. “What kind of name is that?” He laughed, the other two joining them.

The ground began to tremble. The pillar Harry stood against rocked back and forth on the stone platform. He quickly moved away from it. Henry hopped off the tombstone before it fell over. Both boys stood near each other, but Mike remained still.

“What the hell is happening?” he asked, glancing around. The trembling eased, eased, stopped. The air became still and as if the graveyard could be quieter, it did. “Well, that was weird—”

An enormous appendage erupted from the grave beneath Mike. The moans and groans and wails of what sounded like millions exploded over the once silent cemetery. The appendage’s tip opened, blooming like a flower made from oily skeleton arms and ruptured innards, consuming Mike, who didn’t have the chance to yell or cry for help.

Henry and Tommy screamed, dropping their cigarettes, and sprinted away as the appendage spiraled into the air, echoing with the pain of thousands, and weaved back into the hollows of the earth. It still had more to consume, more to devour, adding endlessly to itself until all those who disrespected the deceased were deceased themselves.



































Writing Prompt #90 — Safer Inside
Prompt: “No, I said we were safer, not safe.”

“Come on!” the man screams, waving his hand towards the open door. Creatures wail and shriek, their claws stretching and zipping around me. I cover my head as I crouch under a limb dripping black blood, and nearly trip on another reaching over the trembling sidewalk.

“Come on, hurry! It’s safer in here!”

I push him to the side as I lurch inside. I hear the door slam shut and something metallic whine as it slams down. For a moment it’s quiet. I turn to him and he’s breathing heavy, his forehead beaded with sweat.

“Thank you,” I say. “It’s fucking crazy out there.”

He shakes his head, waving his hand. “Don’t mention it.” He steps around me and I watch him, now noticing that more than half of the small room is blanketed in shadows. I can hear tapping within the darkness, like fingers on glass.

He walks to the wall where a red button juts out, and presses it. Floodlights blare, casting the shadows away. I cover my eyes with my arm until my sight adjusts to the light. When it does— Oh, God… 

“Why— why are those in here?” I ask, my lips quivering.

He looks at the wall of glass that was once hidden. Beyond dozens of the creatures loom, pressing tightly against the pane. Their sharpened claws scratch and tap on the glass, while others’ fang-filled maws suction to it, misting it as they exhale.

“They’re my children. They need fed.”

“What?” I gasp, backing towards the door that begins shaking on its hinges. I stop. “What do you mean you’re children? You said it was safe here…”

He laughs, runs his hand through his hair. With his other, he removes a pistol from his pocket, cocks it and points it at me. “No, no, no… I said it was safer in here. It’s always safer with your family than on your own.”


Writing Prompt #99 — The Humans Are Coming
Prompt: We were “too curious” and always seeking to know more. They sealed us away in our own realm, and closed us off. Clever little things we are, we figured out how to open the paths again. The Gods, the Fae, and the Elder Horrors all tremble. The humans are coming.

“Sergeant!” Captain Young said in the bunker. “Is everything ready?” Their faces were partially illuminated by the hanging light above. They both stared down at the map of the valley and the door stretched across the table.

The Sergeant nodded. “Yes, everything is ready. There are so many explosives attached to the ugly, gray door there’ll be nothing left but ashes, and our men are stationed a few clicks from the blast radius. Once it's gone, we move in.”

“Good, good. What’s the infrared and x-ray say? I wanna know what these bastards are doing before we move.”

The Sergeant removed a few, large sheets of paper and placed them over the map. “They’re scared, Captain; terrified.” He pointed. “You can see that their body temperatures are a color similar to blue, which means cold to us but from our research, that means they’re scared. And the x-rays,” he removed another paper, placed it flat, “tells us they’re moving back, away from the door.”

“Weren’t they standing against it before? I remember the x-ray of all those feelers and eyes…”
“Yes, they were. I think they were curious, feeling us out before we did them… But now they’re retreating. They’re afraid Captain, afraid of us.” He grinned, his eyes widening. “They thought they could keep us out by sealing the door, thought their little mind tricks of insanity and hallucinations could keep us from pushing forward, would make us run away; but now they’re the ones running away…” His voice lowered. “Like my ex-wife, like my daughter, like…”

Captain Young straightened. “Is everything okay, Sergeant?”

A few moments of silence as the Sergeant stared wildly at nothing, then his eyes narrowed and he shook his head. “Yes, everything’s okay. Just want them as bad as you do.” He chuckled.
Captain Young stared at the Sergeant, ignored the obvious, and said: “We trigger the bombs at 05:00 and we move at 05:30, got it?”

The Sergeant nodded. “Yes, yes. 05:00 — I’ll let the bomb squad know.”

“Good, you’re dismissed.”
