About Nick Stokes

You begin.
You are you are you.
You do not know. You have begun this way before. You do not know that. That you began or in this way. You begin this way. You do not know if you begin. Or what is this way. Not knowing is how you begin. You do not know how you begin or where or if this is a beginning of what this is.
If this is a beginning, a beginning again, there had to have been an end. For you. Of you. With you or by you or upon you. In you. If there was an end, was there the end? Was there, You die. The End.
You do not know. You begin again. Or, you are beginning again.
You are confined. You know that much. In this begin again you are constrained. You cannot move. You cannot breathe. It is dark. It is black. An immense weight weighs on you. You feel nothing. An immense weight weighs on you but you feel nothing in the black in which you cannot move. All in time the feeling the weight and the feeling nothing. Take time. You do not know if you are a thing that breathes. A being. You have no urge compulsion burn desire longing reflex need to breathe. You need to move. You must. You are confined trapped constrained and you must get out.
The need grows. You must move but you cannot. You do not taste, you do not smell, you do not breathe, you do not need to, you need to move. You think you see but do not know because all you see is black. You feel nothing but the weight and the need to move, to get out. You become aware of a burning. Is it yours. There is a burning you feel but still you feel nothing. The burning does not negate the nothing. The burning does not illuminate the blackness. The burning is not outside you but in. Not without you but within. Not on your skin if you are being who has skin, but in the skin. What is your shape. You do not remember, you feel nothing, you burn, you cannot move, it is black, you are black, you discover you in the burning, the burning is in you, growing, the burning branching, capillaries, forks, roots, the burning communicating to burning, axon to dendrite, the burning exploding, viruses from the host cell, the burning spreading, fungal mycelia in the soil. You burn within.
From the burning you learn that outside you are a shape with a trunk that branches once above and branches once below, what is above and below, up down. But inside you the branching does not stop, the burning branches and the burning branches and the burning branches, within, burning ever deeper inside, into you, going nowhere, going deeper, going everywhere. You cannot go. In the burning in you, in the weight, in the nothing, still you cannot move. You begin to shake. You are unsure if it is you shaking or if what you are in shakes. You are unsure if there is a difference between you and that in which you are confined. For now you disregard the distinction, you have no knowledge outside you, you feel nothing and burning and weight and shaking, twitching, oscillating. You vibrate. You, a particle in a superposition of infinite states but confined, a thing immaterial but held, a possibility uncollapsed into actuality but trapped. Impossible. You must move, there must be a change. You have to move but you cannot and you must get out but you are in and you are under a great weight without and you burn within and you vibrate at higher and higher frequencies like a string until you emit a horrific or glorious sound, a blacknote, you are a hole, a scream, you momentarily seize, a hole without sense of time, without experience, with nothing, voice, the burn, from the burning nothing explode outward, push, a cataclysm, expand, a catalysis, singular, there is no up or down, you do not know, except in relation to the weight, not a chrysalis, a voice above ground.
You are.

They sit on the porch of a cabin in an alpine meadow. A rounded white rock buffalo mountain looms, green conifers surround, the grass is cured yellow. A bite is in the air. It's fall. A small creek gurgles nearby. Three horses stir in the corral up the hill behind the cabin. The sorrel and the paint munch hay; the bay pisses in it. Three bay mules of varying shades of black, one with white socks, graze in the meadow. The they on the porch are three. He #1 is stocky and shorter than average. He #2 is thin and taller than average. He #3 is of average weight and of average height and brown. But perhaps the certain distinction is only in perception, apprehension, remembering, measuring. They are young, but not that young, for the moment. Their traits exchange, their surfaces fluid, oscillating, as if their possibile qualities are in constant flux but are relative to one another and must at all times cumulatively sum to the same quantity. Quality is another word.
1: You ever think of robbing a bank?
2: What the fuck.
3: Me?
1: Yeah you. Either of you. Any of you.
2: No.
3: Only when I'm watching old westerns. Banks and trains.
2: Nobody uses banks anymore.
1: Nobody. Then where's the money?
3: Years since I was in a bank. In person. Like with my body, myself, my money --
1: I get it --
3: But my paycheck gets deposited in, and the bills get deducted out.
2: That's what I'm saying --
3: Money lives in the bank. Debt lives in the credit card.
1: It's all debt -- in the bank too -- but somewhere there's --
2: That's not actual money, your corporation doesn't send money to your bank, it sends some digital, electronic … 1's and 0's. Some numbers. There's nothing to touch.
1: There's still -- in the big banks, the real ones, in the edificies, in the city, with all the people -- there's still gotta be cash held in the bank. Like in a vault.
2: The cash economy is obsolete. Living in the free economy now. Or the gig economy. Don't recall which.
1: There's some law about it. About having the underlying real thing exist, to, you know, establish its value. 
3: You go tell someone out there money's obsolete. Appears to be all they care about. A short list of the obsolete: horses, mules, mountains … humans. Me, you.
2: Mountains aren't obsolete. Be here after all of us are dead and in the ground.
1: Let me tell you my idea before you get ranting --
2: In the free economy, you pay with your attention, with your thoughts --
1: Just listen for a second --
2: Look here look here look here and you give the device the phone the feed the stream your thoughts --
1: For the love of god.
2: They monetize your consciousness. Listen to this, I read it, "The free economy is the economy of the bartered self."
3: Ok. But we're out here getting away, getting out, escaping for a minute. In the goddamn wilderness. Leave it. Detach. If you keep talking about it, you're thinking about it, giving it voice in your head, it's in your head and you're still in it, a part of it, instead of out here with the mountain and the creek and the horse shit.
2: 
1: My idea: You rob a bank in Flathead Valley, drive the getaway car up the North Fork Road, spitting gravel past Polebridge, ditch it near the Canadian border, hike some miles to where you have horses and mules waiting, and then ride the trails south along the divide all the way to Mexico and escape.
3: That's your idea?
1: That's my idea. You trick them see, the rope-a-dope, the hoodwink, the statue of liberty play, the --
2: Can you still get all the way to Mexico on trail?
1: Sure. Continental Divide trail. Lots of trails.
2: There'd be towns and people and you'd need resupplies.
1: They'd never be aware. A dude recreating in the mountains.
3: That's old west. Sounds like work.
1: Sounds like money. Never have to work again.
2: And your lady?
1: She'd meet me on the trail. Better cover, a couple.
2: What would you do with it? With yourself? Not getting up in the morning for work?
1: Drink margaritas and watch the whales on the beaches of Baja.
2: Your wife doesn't want that much of your presence. And that kind of freedom ... fun, maybe satisfying for a few months, a week, an afternoon, then ... Why wake?
3: Sounds like a movie, bank robbery.
1: Stealing freedom is better than selling my consciousness.
3: Better?
1: Better quality.
2: Alright then, go heist yourself out of the system and do nothing but watch the whales.
1: Just an idea. A thing to talk about on the porch.
3: A modern thieving in the west.

You begin again. Light. White. White light.
You fall up, under your weight.
You are out. Dirt falls from you. Leaks from you. You stand. Clattering. A splash.
Something inside you wants to brush the dirt off your body. Why. Body. Why clean it. You do not. You stand, collapsed in your body. The dirt leaks of its own will. Fluid. Dirt has no will. The dirt rushes away.
The need to move has not gone. The need, the weight. You are out, out of the ground, unearthed, embodied, erupted from darkness in a singular heave, but the weight remains. You are outside but still inside you burn.
A rushing in your ears. You are aware of, hear, no, you remember voices, talking, voices heard. What words, where. Who are you to them.
You fell up, under your weight. Gravity's push, the rush in your ears.
You pushed up out of the earth is what happened. Alone. They are not here, except in your head. They the voices are here in your mind. Hence or nevertheless are they the voices real. Water talking, babbling, clamoring. A river rushes around or through your feet. No, you stand in a slow spot, a backwater, an eddy, a fishing hole. Just over there the river rushes roars in your ears. Rocks fall fell from you, dirt water stone silt. The earth runs from you, liquid earth falling, falling, you fell, you fell down, you fell up, you feel your head with your hand, a hand, a head, red, wet, clean. No need to clean yourself, the river has done it. Not very red. A trickle. No, no longer trickling, not a rivulet, a welling, a source, a seep, a hint.
As if you fell up through fluid earth. 
You submit to the burn within and move your feet, stumble over the rocks through the river, onto the rocks out of the river, onto the bank. You sit on the rocks, the river roaring in your ears, a bluff behind you, your head in your hands. Your head held in your hands is somehow unsolid. Blurry, unawake, soft. What happened and who are you. Silt and water and rocks and roar and clay and voices and burn. What kind of thing, kind of being are you, and what should you do, here, stumbling from a river, unawake, emerging from the muck, dripping, from a bend in the river, trees across, a bench, not that kind of bench, a bluff behind, a long mountain rising above the trees, not rising, risen, already there, finished, never finished, not moving, sitting or standing or laying buried in snow, not buried, snow deep on its peak, not brushing it off, not falling up and standing and letting the snow fall rush roar away, the trees across the river on the flat bench marching up the mountainside, up its flanks, up but failing, flailing, failing to summit, the march of trees stopping at the rocks that bury the mountain, no, the rocks that are the mountain, where the mountain stops the trees, where the mountain says so, where the mountain speaks, where the mountain falls sheer and steep. The mountain does nothing. It lays. It lays itself down. It lies. It voices in your ear. It does nothing. You burn, a head, yours, in hand.

He checks his phone. A mule shifts its weight to its other hind leg and the mud squishes. He blows on his fingers, pulls on his leather gloves, watches his breath rise away. He stands motionless in his long slicker, under his brown felt hat. The air is fluid, almost water, as if they float in a cloud. His breath intertwines with horse breath and mule breath and they become one to make a cloud that rises from the clearing above the huddled lodgepole pines and joins other clouds, the mass of clouds in the sky almost completely light. Stars drowned in light. Not a mass of clouds, but a herd. A herd of exhalations. The moon by which he wrapped and loaded alone still high, but faded, an illusion, no, an influence, no, an insinuation, unseen but lighting the accumulated clouds of breath. The glowing clouds, their intricacies and spires and folds and capillaries, could be another world. The cold sweat of it -- of what, his breath? -- oozes under his clothes, his long johns. He stands still as if the mud holds his pack boots in place, his feet insulated inside, his feet imprisoned. But you know he does not move by an effort of will.
You know things about him.
Two horses, a sorrel and a paint, are tied to lodgepole pines, saddled and bridled. Three bay mules, one with socks, are tied to a hitch rail. They are loaded, white manties muddy from wrapping pack boxes in the mud, a box on each side of each mule's back, forming an upside down v, a ^ on their back, folded white wings muddied by spring. 
He removes his gloves. He checks his phone. He blows on his fingers, puts his gloves on, watches his breath rise.
The loading alone had not been difficult, except for the one with the socks. He danced. How do you know this. Was the fault of the dance him or the mule? He wouldn't stand still. He got one side up and he danced and the load rolled before he could get around to the other side to put the other box up. He bucked and kicked and hauled on the hitch rail until the one box was free and no longer weighing on him and his saddle was clear under his belly. He let him calm for a while, until their breathing their cloud making their sweat cooled. He undid the saddle slowly and resaddled him. He switched the heavy food loads to another mule and loaded the lighter gear loads on the mule with the socks to make an easier job of it alone, until he learns to stand. In his socks. He'll learn, young yet. Not that young. His dance, the shuffling feet, the skittishness were expected. Weren't they. She told him he was green. It's early season, and there are miles and miles, thousands of them, to go. They will do it again and again and again, the daily repetition, and they will get used to each other, comfortable, accommodating, and he will learn to stand in his socks. The loads will get lighter and then heavier and then lighter and then heavier, an incessant oscillation. Good god the mud. Not in the mud everytime. The mud will dry, dessicate, aerate, turn to dust. Hope, what a thing. What a word to think.
There are no vehicles, no trucks, no trailers at the trailhead. There are tracks of trucks and there are their tracks, boots and horseshoes, but rain and mud and other vehicles will obliterate them. He removes his gloves. He checks his phone. She steps out of the woods from the trail they will be leaving by, from the trail he hiked to his stock by.
He: Where in the hell --
She: Let's go. 
He: Been waiting a piece.
She: Runoff's high and the crossings are like to kill us. I mean detain us. I mean slow us down.
He: You mean the rivers are engorged and we won't be able to ford so we'll have to go the long way over the bridge --
She: Through the mud.
He: Yeah, that's why we're going the way we're going.
She: It's a slog to the junction. Turn south and it's a slog thereafter. Let's go.
He: We're going. Into the woods.
She: And take the battery out of that goddamn phone.
He: No service anyway.
She: You've brought them with you.
2.
So you hear voices. Their words are unreal. "We are not speaking in terms of multiple possible alternatives to a single actual world but of multiple actual worlds." The irreal words of Goodman. A name, hallelujah. A name, heaven sent, empty, signifying nothing, devoid of meaning relative to you, strutting back and forth, from whence this word heaven, born of nothingness. A heave in. Nope, that did not help, still means nothing. Once upon a time you met a man named Good who on his way home flew into the side of a mountain. He died. What is in a name. He was not Goodman. He was not you. What are you to the voices, and what are they to you. You fell up, you pushed through, you burn. Whose words. Your words, you feel, nothing, you feel, real. Who are you. You are who is dead. How do you know. You know nothing but.
Begin again. You are dead, sitting on the bank of a river. Your head in your hands. A dent in your head. Damp, not sticky, wet but clean, from the river. You drip. Perhaps you leak. Nothing oozes, all water wet. Perhaps you are a seep. Your left arm is bent funny, not funny, abnormally, should be painful, you do not feel it, is feeling sensation perception reality, that arm akimbo is real, attached to your body but somehow detached from your mind, it still works, bending bizarrely, a robot arm bending and turning and burning on some assembly line making plastic arms, maybe funny. Open wounds, lacerations, abrasions, contusions, bifurcations, branchings, forkings, no oozing, no capillary pressure, no heartbeat in you, in your body you clarify. Clarity is a key. What does the key open? You are ceasing to leak. You do not know if you seep, but you are one. A seep. Your mind feels clear, separate, washed, but you have a lot to suss out, this new situation, or constraint, if you are at all in any way constrained in this nonlife. You are a stranger here. You are not hungry. Yet the forking in you burns, or the forkings in you burn. You do not remember you but you remember you were not often not hungry. You are not hungry in a permanent way. You remember a concept called hunger that you should be feeling, a feeling that could help you answer some of your questions, questions such as what do you do now, but you cannot imagine what that feeling would feel like. A need that could be satiated, if only momentarily, an emptiness that could be filled, if by absurd intangibles, a thirst that could be slaked, if it took an entire river to drown you in. Words. Voices. The burn in you will not be quenched by the river, you just emerged from the river, the burn in you is not a redox reaction, the burn in you is not combustion, or maybe it is, it does not matter.
Begin again. You are not alive. Is there an end, then, to this nonlife, or is it forever. The thought terrifies you, makes you sweat, you are pretty sure you cannot sweat, terrifies is also too much of a word, it just came to you, the thought of forever makes you feel empty, or nothing, makes you feel nothing, that is the one. Thou doth apply the word nothing too much. You set it aside for later, the question, it sounds like there will be an excess of laters. Slater. Claret. Clarity. Your body is dead but still moves, if at times unwillingly, with difficulty, requiring an excess of thought, fitfully, disjointedly. Or was that just the initial waking rebirth erupting rising upfalling whatever. You burned inside you desired needed ached to move you could not. Then you moved and that did not slake the burn. It burns, you burn, to do something. Your body is foreign to you, not yours, an other, but attached to you inexorably. Your mind is not dead, you can barely contain it, you know not of the brain, or if it is dead it is alive, racing remembering perceiving associating, hearing what is not here. Your mind is undead.
Begin again. What are you supposed to do. Supposed presupposes an imposed order, or perhaps an internal purpose, or from a different angle a moral ought. But you are dead and undead, constrained seemingly somehow and free apparently in some way. Is there order or purpose or ought, thick words, is your cart before your horse, voices, maybe to be or not to be is not the question, and if there is, what.

He pulls into the pullout and parks the car. The car is non-descript, an older passenger car without a nav system. An American make. A slurry of mud and gravel dust sprayed up its sides. Drizzle steams off the hood. Fading into the gray green, gray brown, gray gray of the surroundings, the gray of dusk. Standing over the trunk he transfers bricks of money from two military surplus duffle bags to two new backpacks, one smaller than the other, not randomly but systematically, not tossing, not frantic, but with intention, brick by brick, side by side and then row by row as if building a structure of dollars, a building of paper currency, a column, to support what, a bridge or an ancient roman viaduct or the marble head of someone once significant but now stone, as if building with toy blocks, a child. His thoughts or yours? The bricks just fit in the bulging backpacks, as if the volume of money in the duffle was precalculated and arranged to match the advertised volume of the backpacks. He stows a water bottle in an outside pocket on each backpack, jerky and a granola bar and a candy bar into another pocket. He wears 10-inch black leather logging boots, lug soles. No one has driven by, a bit of chance, of good fortune, good planning, no one was likely to at this time of day, on this day of the week, at this time of year, at this place on a side deadend gravel road to nowhere but more wet gray woods in the far north country near the border. Unless he was followed. The cash is stowed. The air oozes water like a saturated sponge. With a leatherman he unscrews the plates and finds some sliver of space in the packs in which to slide them; he has already filed the VIN number; the car is an old make without a computer; he does whatever else is necessary for the vehicle to not be identified with him. He returns to the trunk and backpacks of money. He checks his phone, turns on its light, and opens a map. He pulls a compass from his pocket and orients the map to north and takes a bearing on a short line drawn on the map in pencil that crosses a small green empty space and connects a solid line with a dashed line, neither far on the paper map nor relatively far in the man's space that it represents. The dashed line met by the pencil line intersects with a web of dashed lines, which spread. He looks up at the direction his bearing delineates in the real world, straight into the black woods, no trail, far and not far are relative, towards a piece of orange flagging gone gray in this lightlessness tied to some sopping branch of brush. He does all this quickly and efficiently, as if he already knows the outcome and he is going through the motions for self-reassurance, a performance for himself, or you. He turns off the light on his phone and straps a headlamp above the brim of his hat and turns it on and heaves the larger backpack onto his back and slips his arms through the straps of the smaller backpack and secures it to his chest. A backpack on back, a backpack on front, his arms protruding. Unarmed. A turtle upright, legs protruding, unarmed. He slams the trunk, a sudden noise to bring about the silence. Unsilence filled with drip. He locks his keys in the car. He lumbers to the edge of the black woods, the edge of the gray gravel, to the treeline, to the strip of orange flagging and removes it, shoving it in a pocket. He, a dark misshapen form, a lump with a lamp on its head, with paper bricks strapped dorsally and ventrally, shell or armor or exoskeleton, yes perhaps he is a turtle or but also perhaps a beetle, an arrangement of galactic matter set in motion that wants, stands before the dark monolithic woods and seemingly for his own benefit says, "Fucking bushwhacking." Pathless, he plunges into the woods, pierces the black curtain, and in the gloaming the woods fight back. Branches whack him, he slips and trips, he is soaked immediately, sopping, cursing incessantly, bleeding from a cut on his face, his hands, falling and standing with great effort under the weight of his exoskeleton, continuing again, fighting for something, wanting what, a dim light bobbing, rolling over down trees, stumbling over rocks and branches, swimming through brush, falling and rising away in the dark dimming and gone.

What do you want. Knowing what you want would establish what you should do. That is how it works. One does to satisfy one's wants. You must want. It is a commandment or something. Wanting is a condition of life. If not wanting, needing. But you are uncertain if you are alive or dead. If alive, you are certain your life is qualified. If he wants a sheep, that is proof he exists. Words from another country, from a prince, from an asteroid. You know these things, not what you want. More voices within.
What of your surroundings. You have determined, not determined, have become aware or made yourself aware or are aware, have observed a few qualities or characteristics about your interior, your inside, when you turn your mind's eye within. Namely the burn, the weight, the branching, the need to do, the not knowing what to do, the not knowing your want, the broken body, the fog of memory, the eruption of voices, the absence of feeling, the feeling of nothing. 
What of without.
You sit on a riverbank, on a down tree, a tree long down, gray, bark long stripped, not stripped, washed away in repeated spring runoffs, a log worn smooth, rot setting in. Worn river rocks pink and gray and blue stretching from the edge of the bank to the river and then under the river where they grow large and the water courses around them. Behind you and the bank is a bench of trees, cottonwoods and lodgepoles, the cottonwoods gone yellow and massive, a few ponderosa pines red-barked and tall and maybe five-hundred years old. Not immortal. What is the bank then, on which you say you sit. A four-foot-high step, a dwarf bluff, a hillock, a steep but abbreviated rise of dirt and rock and mud and roots and clay delineating the river rocks, the riverbed, from the bench. Or does the riverbank include the river rocks that are not currently in the river. Does not the definition of a riverbank include the edge of the river, all that forms the border with water. You do not remember. Is there more to the river than water. The water flows by, always going leaving roaring, but the river remains. Forever going, always here. 
All these substances strange to you now. The bank is hard to define, then. The log you sit on is either on the bank or below or above or before or after the bank. Or all of them simultaneously. The bank is insignificant in and of itself, meaningless except as part of the river. The river is full of stones worn smooth. Not full. Some of the river's stones are in the river, some out. The proportion changes with the fluctuation of seasons. Fish are in the river. Fish, too, feel no pain. Another voice spouting. It's ok to eat fish because they don't have any feelings. Too. You do not want to eat them. But if they feel no pain, are they not conscious. Are they a lower form of consciousness. Are there levels of consciousness. What of the rocks worn smooth, and the river that contains and does not contain them. And you, who feel nothing. Get your mind out of the river for a minute and look around. Groundwater seeps over slick yellow clay deposits in the hundred-foot bluff across the river. From where the systems of measurement. From your fog. Your seep. Clouds puffy drift high in the sky where the blue deepens. Birds, small birds, morning birds swoop chitter chirp. How morning. You do not know except it was recently black. You were underground. Black-capped chickadees in the trees, no, in the brush, but trees rhymed, it sounded more right, righter, and seeped out. Sandpipers skim the river's surface, swallows swoop after insects, two crows caw from tree to tree. None of which are exclusively morning birds. No vultures. You once saw vultures pick clean a dead seal next to the thundering ocean in an hour. Not here. Here you know you are in the middle of the wilderness. No, irrelevant, the mountains. Far from the seas into which all rivers run. A hummingbird flies straight up into the sky, not piercing it or being swallowed by it but becoming it. From bird to mote to sky.
(4)
A hummingbird dives from high, from nowhere. It hovers over the river, then ascends, then descends, then ascends, then descends, as if hanging from a string. A yo-yo. It zips away.
He: We can't wait for it to go down.
She: No rush.
He: They could be following us.
She: I doubt it.
He: It'll be days before it goes down.
She: Unless they tracked your phone.
He: Unless it starts raining again.
They talk loudly, nearly shouting, from horseback to horseback, over the rush of the river.
He: If they have a good tracker.
She: They don't. They don't have anyone who could pay the proper attention.
He: They have dogs.
She: Yes. They have dogs. Dogs pay attention. It's why their species came into existence. Fortunate for us the dogs aren't running the show.
He: We can't wait --
She: We can wait long enough to make the right decision --
He: They'll catch us and we're done.
She: River catches us and we're dead.
He: I can swim.
She: Maybe. Maybe not in that. Maybe a mule gets swept downstream. Maybe a pack gets rolled by the water and the mule, Socks say, drowns. Or maybe the pack rolls and comes loose and gets swept down the river, gone, food or gear or currency ... freedom floats away.
He: I know. Quit enunciating every little possibility so properly. Wasting time talking.
The horses are beginning to dance on the rock bank. She silently gazes at the river, turning her head as her horse dances to maintain her silent gaze at the river.
He: Your silent gaze isn't helping us make a decision.
She: I'm thinking.
He: What're you thinking?
She: Nothing.
He: What I thought. Let's go.
She: Sometimes you have to wait. To attend. That's where the consciousness happens.
He: You can't say that over the foaming white froth of a roaring river. I'd rather die in the river than get caught by them. 
She: Shh. Chomping at the bit. You are your words, your thoughts, your actions. Wait.



She: Ok. Give me the mules and follow my lead.
She takes the lead rope of the Socks mule and rides the paint into the river, the string trailing her, cutting a line upriver in a bend, against the current, horse wanting to turn straight across the river but she holds his head to her line, into the current, belly deep, horse wanting to turn around but she kicks him and keeps his head, one-by-one the mules belly deep, her feet in water, out of the stirrups, she leans into the horse, traversing the hidden underwater ridge she read in the waves, roaring water, middle of the river, her legs are wet, roaring, she points the horse at a more direct angle across, still slightly upstream, he stumbles, rocks, white water, pushing the mules downstream the further back on the string, roaring, river catching mules' packs, the horse fights the current and surges across, she gets in his mouth to slow him to keep the mules, up a steep bank and out of the water. Her chaps and jeans are dark and wet above the knee. The mules, drifted further downstream, each into progressively deeper water, surge one-by-one from the river up and out onto the bank, the last one swimming, Moses, pulled by the lead rope pig-tailed to the mule before, Belle, the rope holding his head out of the water, pulling, until Moses surges out. The man, further downstream, is out of the saddle, on his horse's neck, clinging, his horse swimming. The sorrel too surges up the bank, and the man falls off, wet to the waist and heaving breath. The sorrel shakes. He shakes. Horses and mules drip. He dumps out his cowboy boots.
He: I could've died.
She: You followed the mule, not me.

The birds had have names. Swallow, piper, crow, humming, starling. Clark's nutcracker. Whippoorwill. The trees have names. Douglas, Engellman, whitebark, ponderosa, lodgepole, western. The fish have names. Westslope cutthroat, bull, white. The rocks. The river must have a name. Given by men. By man. By humans. Do you have a name. A human name. Given.
You are thinking of it wrong. Those are names, the bird names, given to a group of birds, a subset, a classification, distinguishing them from other types of birds. The bird names are not used to identify an individual. The birds, trees, and fish do not have individual names. The river does. Your question remains. Do you have a name. You were human, now you are other. Humans have individual names, given by other humans, but what now, when you are exhuman, quasi alive, alive with qualifications, dead with awareness. Is the bird, say a crow, without its own name, less alive than a human with a name. A name has not been given you. You are nameless, like the crow. Mules have names. Do they then have more selfhood than you. But you know yourself. The hummingbird darting zipping swooping is not aware it is alive. Does that not mean the bird is less alive than you. Because of its lack of awareness of its life, of itself, of others, of time. A lack of self-consciousness. And what of the crow soaring cawing voicing. Is a bird singing aware that it sings. What of the ants, the fish, the owl, the mouse, the goat and elk and bear. Ants do not sing, marching one-by-one hurrah. Hivemind, no, eusocial, they follow the queen. Fish feel no pain. Does the owl know it waits in silence. Does it think in waiting. Have an awareness of itself within the world and without it. Or is it a robot, an ant, a zombie. A machine following its coded instructions. You cannot get in the silent owl's head. Hoo who hoo. Only yours. Do crows make choices. Could there not be levels of consciousness, from rock to tree to ant to fish to bird to mule to human. Is that the proper order. Where are you on the continuum. Two u's next to each other, you did not know that was possible. The possible grows. You feel more and less alive than you used to. You wait. The river has a name. The bank does not, except as possessed by the river. You wait for you to form, for the machinations in your mind to play out, for you to seep from the fog the river the silt. The sky. There is nothing here to tell you who you are, what you are, what to think, what to do. You fell down, then you fell up. The glitches of memory. You check your pants pockets why did it take you so long. Nothing. Coat pockets, nothing. You wear a coat. It is wet, heavy, draining. You do not feel cold. You have no name, but the river does. Nothing. You wait for you in nothing and in the waiting think and in the thinking wait and in the waiting not think but be and in the waiting you form.

He sips his coffee. It could be Starbucks in a paper cup or Folgers in a styrofoam cup or a travel mug full of the local craft brew from beans roasted artisanally and harvested using sustainable shade-grown organic practices and acquired from that faraway place using economic methods that are also sustainable in support of the local population, the people behind the beans, and not usury, you're unsure. It could be all three. He sits in a chair in a waiting room, not a waiting room but a waiting area, three chairs outside a door, generic banquet chairs that stack nicely when stored or metal folding chairs with a hint of cushion or fashionable curvy plastic tech chairs in a bold color. He sits in a chair. He wears a lanyard from which dangles a card or badge bearing his picture and name and position in the company. His picture looks like everyone else. He is in the badge. He is on his phone. Not sitting on it. Not standing on it. Not on it in the same way he is on the chair, in the chair, or on his badge, in his badge. His badge shows who he is on the surface. You cannot read who he is on the surface. Because of the fog or because the closer you look at his face on the badge the faster his features change, a vibrating smear, the harder you try to read his name and position and company to which he belongs the more the words change, the letters a blur, a multitude of meanings manifest in unreadable words. Sometimes a possibility hesitates a moment longer as the face name positions scrolls through possibilities. He is a balding middle-age man wearing a white short-sleeve button-up shirt and slacks. He is a slight pot-bellied guy with long hair in business casual. He is a fit dude with short-cropped hair and a long beard in a form fitting black t-shirt and tight jeans. He is a woman in a floral flowing skirt wearing large hoop earrings and several layers of different colored and patterned shirts or blouses under a cardigan and a scarf. A different kind of on. His picture is not on the phone, the smart device, not on its surface. His reflection is on its surface. But still he is on his phone in a different way than his reflection is on his phone. His face glows. He interfaces. His thumbs caress it up and down, his fingers tap it. He does not touch a woman this way. He does not scroll through a woman this way. He scrolls through women, swiping, or through communications from friends, pecking responses or picking emojis, or reads or listens to the news on politics or the news on entertainment, updates on his latest shows, he watches a show, updates on his latest friends, giving glancing attention to myriad photos no filter and photos with filter, doctored, photoshopped, shopped. He finds imaginary virtual creatures in an app game that overlays the real world while wandering around real streets while waiting in the real waiting area, not waiting much because he is on his phone, his attention flitting like a hummingbird hovering, not hovering, flitting from flower to flower. Hummingbirds give much attention to their flowers. He hovers over and flits between status updates chosen for him by an algorithm designed to peak his interest. Advertisements materialize before him tailored for his consciousness, knowing him, knowing what he likes and how he reacts, knowing what and how he thinks, hovering over a video of a dung beetle pushing a ball of shit up a hill, the video looping as the dung beetle is right where it started pushing a ball of shit up a hill, again pushing a ball of shit up a hill for forever, or for as long as his attention hovers over it, over a caption that reads "Camus smiles, again, and again, and … ;)" He hovers over the stream of information, the infinite possibilities corralled and doctored and channeled, a coral trail nectar song chosen, developed, curated for his attention, made just for him. Making him. He leans back, rubs his eyes, inhales deeply, his head above water again, and sighs. He looks around the waiting area, the hall, the anteroom. What is he waiting for? What is he doing here? How long until lunch? How long until his boss tells him what to do. He gazes out into space, into the nowhere. He cannot maintain the gaze. He flicks a fleck of lint. He returns to his phone again, gazes at it, gets back on it. He asks it, How far is it from the Canadian border to the Mexican border on the Continental Divide Trail? The phone says some number of miles in a pleasing woman's voice. He leans into her, scrolls through her map, tracing her trail. He is on her. He is giving her his attention. He is on the phone. How. Not like a man. It is not sexual. The sexual point of view is too easy, too hard and soft, too wet, too shared, too reproductive and pleasuring. You watch his consciousness consumed. It is asexual. A giving. Giving himself to it. Giving up. Giving in. On. No. In. He is in the phone.

Nothing happens while you wait. The river flows, rocks erode, trout rise for flies. The crow caws, an osprey floats above the river on a river of air, ants dig in the bank. Life continues. Not yours. Nothing happens to you while you wait. Could you make something happen. You rose once, from the river. Or you fell up. What would you make happen. You are making nothing happen. Except you have these foggy images, uncertain remembrances of the present, vibrating visions. Oscillations from your here and now. You hesitate to name them memories because you are not certain they are past. Perhaps it is not that nothing happens while you wait, but that everything happens while you wait. You are not certain they happened, these voices and actions and oscillating actualities. Are they you. So you robbed a bank. No, wrong way to say it. A bank was robbed. You are present. You witness the robbery. It is a man. You are the man. You are a man in a mask in a small suburban bank in which there are only two tellers on a Wednesday morning as he calmly walks behind the counter while they are momentarily frozen in indecision and he gets close to them, very close, his hands raised palm outwards at his chest in a defenseless gesture, and says calmly, quietly, "Give me all the money," and takes one of their hands in his, places his other hand on the other's shoulder, sharing a confidence, "And we will all stay safe," and they do it, fill his bags with money for him. You are a man with a bandana firing shots in the air in a stone edifice downtown while people scream. You are a faceless man jacking an ATM outside a bank's front door while it is being repaired on a Sunday morning. You are all of them and you witness all of them and they are the same man but they are different men and part of you feels like you are this man, these men, that you are in actuality them choosing and acting, but part of you feels differently, saying that man, those men, is are not you, as if you are in their heads, or they yours, and you are only experiencing what they experience or experienced. Only. You feel, not feel precisely, you can describe the trace of an emotion that you think, not feel, abstracted emotion directed at, but not solely outwardly directed but also inhabiting, an emotion then that you think of the man or men: affection and anger. An awareness of them. But also a distance. A distance not physical and not temporal. A distance from yourself perhaps. All this, all this being you relative to them, relates to why, or how, you fell down, then up, and burn. But how and what to do about it. "All that 'for nothing' in order to repeat and mark time." "From the point of view of Sirius, Goethe's work in 10,000 years will be dust and his name forgotten … Seriously meditated upon, it reduces our perturbations to the profound nobility that is found in indifference. Above all it directs our concerns toward what is most certain -- that is toward the immediate." A voice, now internal. Another's, once, now his. About another man and a star, a binary star, a star associated with a godly dog in the sky by humanity, a bright binary star, the brightest from here. Their relation, you do not remember, it seeps up in you. But what then, should you let go of the perturbations, and then what. What is certain here is a river for which you have no thirst and creatures for which you have no hunger and a burning neither quenched by your internal seep nor smothered by the blanket of sky that is not the source of the weight but is beautiful and blue and gray and everchanging and seemingly possessing nothing to do with you.

Her face flickers in the firelight. He is trying to be attentive. That is what is wanted, or what they want, or what they say she wants, or what some nobody somewhere says we want. To be heard. 
He: What star is that?
She: I'm not Siri or Alexa.
He: I'm not saying you are --
She: What's it matter to you what that star is named?
He: Just curious. I just want to know.
She: What makes you think I know?
He: I don't know … I respect you as a smart woman.
She: Ask her.
He: I have no voice. I mean, You know there's no service. I mean, you have her battery.
She: You've been using a solar charger with your extra battery.
He: You're just getting my goat to make a point.
She: You brought them with us. 
He: It'll come in handy sometime. They will, if you prefer. She … I haven't turned her on. But they could give us some piece of information we need to survive, or a communication we need to succeed, or our location when we are lost so we can proceed, or --
She: It's Sirius. The Dog Star. 
A horse on the highline, his sorrel, stomps. Blending into the night, a mule walks through the trees nearby cracking branches underhoof, leaving the sounds of weight on the ground as it steps. The glints of fires in its eyes float in the dark. The tent is behind them, away from the highline and the horses, nearer the creek, which babbles softly.
She: Any more questions?
He: Cold out. 
She: Not a question.
He: Not summer yet.
She: 
He: You gonna sleep in the tent tonight?
She: You brought three pairs of boots.
He: They serve three different roles. Hiking, riding, mud. Gonna be a long trip.
She: I'm looking forward to crossing the Rio Grande and me turning left and you turning right.
He: More pleasant to the right. Beaches. Baja. The Pacific. Whales. I brought sandals too. What're you gonna do with yourself, turning left? 
She: Build an immense library full of all human knowledge and light the last dollar bill on fire and burn the whole thing down in a futile attempt to create a star. I'll invite Borges to watch.
He: I'm gonna buy freedom. No work. No obligations. Nothing to do. Piña coladas all day long. 
She: That's not freedom.
He: I'm not talking about inebriation. I'm talking about not having to get up to go to some pointless skullfuck job everyday. About not having my existence predicated and valued on buying and selling, debt and payment. About having myself, my life, be mine. About not wasting my time.
She: You're trapped hiding in the wilderness, on the lamb, slave to the currency in those packs, and you committed a crime, broke one of their laws, and you brought it, her, them, with you, and everything you want is still, in your supposed freedom, in relation to them. You are their currency.
He: I'll smell the flowers. I'll study the stars. I'll watch whales.
She: Hell. Observing. You need a reason, a way to carve out a space. 
He: I don't know if we're saying different things.
She: Our lives mean nothing, and they are all we have. They mean nothing and they only have meaning relative to others and their history. We are chained and always will be and who we are is defined by what we do to fight those chains. There is only freedom in death. 
He: Jesus, that's noble. You want me to contemplate my pointlessness? Is that a reason? How do you keep going with such a goddamn profound higher awareness of your insignificance?
She: Because as far as we know, this is it, and outside of that, we are gone.
He: You keep going because we die and …
She: And nothing.

In this flood seep leech of words giving substance to you, you almost forget you burn. But it is the burn that is the instigation. The burn to move, to do, to say. To move where, when you are inanimate, to do what when you have no need, to say these memories possibilities perturbations creations when you have no memories of your own, when you are impossible, imperturbable, uncreated. Perhaps not imperturbable. But perhaps imperturbable in some senses, but the word you meant was permutations, but what is the opposite of permutation. Unchanging singularity. Impermutable. Disorder. Or immutable. Can you mutate in an orderly way or are you a one-off mutant. Do you create a fable to impose order on your seep leak leech, or to give yourself the illusion of existing. A Marquis de Sade, imprisoned. Mind confined in a body. Trapped, comatose, aware, burning, in a dead man. He says "their corruption is so dangerous, so active, that they have no other aim in printing their monstrous works than to extend beyond their own lives the sum total of their crimes; they can commit no more, but their accursed writings will lead others to do so, and this comforting thought which they carry with them to the tomb consoles them for the obligation that death imposes on them of renouncing this life." Does that explain your presence here, now. Do you create a table of your crimes to reach across the life-death divide, to live on in others, to infect others with your necrotic thoughts. You had no thought of others, but now that you mention it, now that the Marquis mentions it. The kind brigand, the intellectual outlaw, the criminal with a heart of gold, the mastermind woman. Could your thoughts, your mental creations affect others. Even dead, could your actions, if you were able to do, reach the living. You have been groping in your head no mind for all you know your brain is nothing now but worms, kneading digging weeding panning rooting in your mind for you. But what if what you make of yourself is not only within but without you. "Creating or not creating changes nothing." But at the same time, not creating or creating changes nothing. The burn the weight the nothing, is it changeable and can you change it. By ascertaining yourself. By bringing yourself into existence. By observing your effect in others. You are alone, no other here with you to tell you you exist. You rush to the riverbank, no you were on the riverbank, you rush to the river, no you cannot rush, you scuttle herky-jerky to the water's edge and look in, no the water moves too fast, carries your face away, too choppy and rippled, you scramble to backwater, a flat pool you look into and you are not there. Your face is not in the water, only rocks and silt and water. No other, no relation, no reflection. But you perceive you in this body. You tell yourself you are you. I am I. The birds, the fish, the ants and beetles and flies pay you no mind. Are you invisible, are you uninteresting, are you not in their umwelt, are you -- vampires bear no reflections and other occult imaginations -- a zombie then. Can a zombie not reflect. Or are you not here, do you not exist. You have nothing but your own consciousness and your perception of burn and weight and nothing as substantiation. The burn and the seep. The welling of thoughts like groundwater rising from the great weight of the world. 
Does anyone else know you exist, can they, would they see, acknowledge, recognize, communicate with your consciousness. If you were here, with them, where they are, perhaps you could see. You must see yourself in their faces, not as a yes/no corroboration of your existence burn presence, but as a relation a reflection a reaction, an effect. To see yourself relative to another conscious being. Nor must you see yourself in their faces as objective evidence of their existence -- you have these remembrances permutations possibilities that are real for you. To gather more information, to hunt more knowledge of your surroundings, to cultivate more awareness of yourself, of others, to sow your awareness of self outside of you and into others, to extend your consciousness across the divide you must see yourself in their eyes, in their faces, in their thoughts.

I am cold and wet and hungry and rich. I possess the currency for freedom from the system of oppression, of wage slavery, of justice for the moneyed and the powerful, from the primary value generation being money generation, the profit motive, from being a choiceless robot without life, without consciuosness, a cog of economy, a process of purchasing and selling, consuming and being consumed. But I cannot use the currency, cannot employ the currency, cannot wield the currency. I can only move it from place to place through the mud in the mountains via mules. I cannot free myself with the money or free myself of the money. I am hungry, we are hungry, not the stock, they are fine, ample spring grass, but she will not let me go into town to buy a resupply. With the money. Of course she is right. Too close to the scene of the crime. The money could be marked. Whatnot. But I am locked in the wilderness holding the key to freedom. Everything is mud. We spied the shed hunters across the flats two days ago but avoided them. The elk are still in the lowlands, a herd of two dozen yesterday among P-pines. They fled as we approached. A barehanded armless hunt. Why did I insist on no gun? It's robbery with or without arms and now we are hungry and there is no authority here to deter poaching but we are saddled with my choice to commit the act unarmed. Did she bring an arm despite my desire for the cleanliness of the act matching that of the purpose and is she withholding her arm to prove a point. The point? Perhaps nothing more than oppositional defiance. Or the maintenance of power via the control of arms. More likely the former. This morning I snuck up on a cow elk and a calf by the river. They could not hear me for the spring runoff roar, they could not see me for the brush, and they could not smell me by the blind fortune of approaching them from downwind. I imagined myself throttling the calf. I hoped the cow wouldn't try to protect her. A cow elk is much bigger than a man. As I leapt from the brush the cow jumped inland and bolted and the calf jumped in the river. She caught in the brush below me, below the bank now mostly submerged, what in summer must be dry floodplain, her muzzle underwater, the river working on her. I jumped in, cold water to my stomach, slow there at least out of the main current, the calf underwater but for a black eye staring at me, afraid or imploring I don't know. Both perhaps. Or perhaps expecting nothing of me. Expecting death. Perhaps her brain had shut down and there was nothing behind her eye. I lifted her head and set it on my shoulder to hold it above water and untangled her legs from the branches. She did not fight me. She had given up. I carried her to the lip of the bank and scrabbled up it. Out of the water she was as heavy as a sopping pack. She was shaking. I laid her down, a sodden quivering ball. I too was shaking and sodden. There was something in her shaking, in how I'd almost caused her to drown and then saved her, a reaction without thought, something in her empty eye … I'd imagined throttling her, pictured myself doing it, hands around her neck, but now I couldn't, couldn't wrap my shaking hands around her shaking neck. I wanted to hold her in my arms, to warm her and comfort her, but I feared that would keep the cow away and what she needed was her mother. I left her, hoping the cow would return. I stumbled back to camp, empty-handed and barely functional and she started another fire and we lost a day in my recovery and drying out and I don't know what happened to her, the calf. Standing in the water as I pulled her out, she had not seen me, she had looked through me. In the absence of expression in her eye I had not been sure I existed. Imagining throttling her, I almost drowned her, then I didn't. Without reason, without meaning, there still remains life. I'm still hungry. I live without logic, without knowing why. But I cling to living. If everything is permitted, what to do. "If I no longer had any faith in life, if I doubted a woman I loved, or the universal order of things, if I were persuaded, on the contrary, that everything was only an infernal and accursed chaos -- even then I would want to live." My name is not Ivan. I am just cold and wet and hungry. I almost suffocated an elk calf by hand, then by water, but I didn't, and I don't know that I existed to her. I want to live my humanity, to be free, to be full, and to not be prey to a bankrupt system, to not live like a robot, to not be a zombie. But sitting next to me staring into the fire is a giant black calf elk's eye.

You have lived your life, or you lived life, or you lived what you are no longer certain was life, as if your self were rooted in a body that is, was singular, stable, and permanent until death, a body that was yours, that was consistent even as it grew and changed and all your cellular material was replaced, through maladies and injuries and deterioration, through the stench of decay, wait, you were talking about what you loosely call your life. You do not think you lived long enough to experience decay while alive. And what of now. You claim to have no sense of smell. A metaphorical stench perhaps. But there is the inadequately explained internal burning. Do you experience decay currently while neither alive nor dead, does decay account for the burn. Insufficient and tangential. A body housed you, a body that was yours. You remember the feeling of being one with your body, of it being you, but you do not feel it now. You remember the feeling but do not remember the actualities of the body you were in, its attributes and characteristics and strengths and failings. The body you are contained in, no, constrained in now, which you think you want to see in the eyes of others, is alien, other, unknown to you. Perhaps not wholly constrained, restrained, isolated within, because though you are alone wanting to go in this body, from this body, this corpse, corpus, though you want to go and need to do and have thus far been unable to go or do -- when you say far you refer to distance not time, time depends on your observational point of view -- you do have these thoughts, perturbations, permutations, possibilities that are not yours, or if they are yours do not originate from you, or you are not thinking them, or not consciously, not willfully, though they are here, present, like an object -- nevermind, when you say far you do also refer to time, but the issue, one issue, is that there is not one consistent flow of time for you with all the many different observational points of view erupting, strong word choice, in your thoughts -- or if you are thinking them, because so too can you experience the process of the thinking of thoughts, you are not doing so in the here and now. You think. You think them but so too are they other. You think and unthink.
The calf eye is watching me watching the fire and I have no one to show it to, to share it with, no juice for my phone to take a picture to share with other people to see, to instagram for the catalogue of what I've experienced in my life, to send out into the digital ether for others to like, a giant black calf elk eye gazing at him, at me, the eye open, a hole, and no means to share it with the digital cloud of others, disconnected alone unconnected nonexistent without connection relation to others real or virtual, if you see a giant calf elk eye in the wilderness and it has no representation in the digital infosphere, does it make a sound, if the giant disembodied eye is not connected to the digital world does it exist? He continues, I continue living with a lack of logic, no one to share with, no one to be relative to, no eyes of others on the eye on I. Alone. She is here but she is mastermind and she is not here. I, alone. I alone first aware of eye, and no other to share it with at the speed of light into another eye and this first awareness of eye, I, unplugged from others from everything alone might make me I am so cold and hungry vibrate to death.
Do these thoughts happen in another place. They do not feel like yours. You turn them over like a foreign object lodged in your mind, a river stone, like gristle picked from your teeth. More pop up, get stuck, all the time, but you do not feel like you are eating, ingesting. Do they happen in another time. For you they are present, presents, boxes to be unwrapped, opened, sorted. You can inspect the process of their formation, observe their development in you, in your body seemingly, but as if they are outside, without you, without feeling the emotion of them, the desperation fear desire love. You can inspect the process of their formation as in their relation to one another, how they build or do not build on what precedes them, or follows them, but you cannot inspect their biological or physical underpinnings. Your brain does not work, your neurons do not fire, there is no action potential within you, no neurotransmitters leaping synaptic clefts, no axons stimulating dendrites, no neuronal network. You think. You are dead after all, or undead, though you cannot look inside your skull. You imagine jelly within. The jiggle of it when you give your head a shake. Perhaps a metaphorical shake, you are not sure if you have been able to move since that initial lurch. Metaphors are impossible to completely explicate, yet they contain truth. Nevertheless you are not sure if you used the word correctly. At any rate you cannot currently examine the physical basis of your thoughts. Perhaps they are created in another and you have access to them by virtue of an unexplained phenomenon, the burning, to which you are subject, having crossed the divide, of which you are becoming aware. Or perhaps you were incorrect and the thoughts memories possibilities are or were created in this body you find yourself in in living death, the body you fell up into, and you experience them because they are still housed there, here, in the atonal, no, attuned neuronal connections and subsystems and systems and interrelations of this brain. In both cases this exquisite corpse and its brain are indeed alien to you.
But perhaps, if such a thing is possible, that is to say your consciousness materializing in a foreign body like a cuckoo chick hatching in another's nest, which might indicate that your consciousness requires a body, a location, a place, a substance to reside in, as if the body helps to create your consciousness, the firing and intertwining of neurons and whatnot, forgiving that this body is dead and that you proposed that your body is biologically unfunctional, but no, also considering it, the physical impossibility of it, of you, or at least the negligible possibility, to begin again, perhaps the obverse is possible, that your brain, no, say mind, has constructed a body for your convenience, a model that is temporarily useful for you, based on statistical correlations from perceptions and observation. Which is to say, perhaps your body is a phantom. Immaterial. As when one loses a limb and imagines a phantom limb in its place, when your body and life are gone you imagine a phantom body and a phantom life, except there is no promise of external reality to contradict your imagining, so perhaps the phantom is real. A projection of your mind. A ghost.
In which case, if your body is a phantom, these thoughts you experience are your only real basis. Your only reality. These thoughts which must be your thoughts. Must. Why. There is still the possibility that some of the thoughts are yours, such as these thoughts now, and some of the thoughts are not yours, such as the big disembodied calf eye as one example. And if it is possible that your body is a phantom, a projection of your mind, perhaps so too is it possible that you can project your sensations, perceptions, observations onto external objects, or into, by seeing them as you. You could in a sense create the others as you might your body. Or if they already exist you imagine how they sense, perceive, think, feel and in so doing move inside them and draw them into you, they become part of you, another's thoughts are your thoughts, an intertwining, as with love and empathy. Big words for you who feel nothing, but perhaps you feel nothing but what others feel. You may incorporate pieces of others into you and experience them as you and project you into them as well, imagine into others and incorporate them into you, a consumption or a sharing, an incorporation or a collective. They become you and you them. 
You should go. You must go, you burn, even if the going is projection, to discover others, whether the burning is real or not real you feel it in your mind, to find out, to find in, to find the phantom or ghost or to consume others or to create a tangible world via corporeal empathy. You must go to find or create what is real.

He: We need food.
She: I know.
He: We are out of food.
She: Eye know.
He: You are neither the eye nor I.
She: Just trying to liven up saying the same thing over and over. You are hungry.
He: It's there, here. Dead, black, staring at, on, me.
She: You need food.
He: As big as a mule. Maybe not dead. But we cannot eat it.
She: There is no eye. We need food.
He: The eye … it's trying to, to impart knowledge to me, not knowledge, awareness, of the stars, of I, of others, but eyes don't give, they take, consuming, eating light, drinking in the outside world, swallowing the spirit. 
She: There is no we in I. Say, I need food. Say it. Speak it.
He: I need food. 
She: Good. Now it's real. The swim took a lot out of you.
He: I need to go to town.
She: We're not going to town.
He: To order a couple of cheeseburgers and a beer. A pitcher.
She: We'd be identified.
He: To drink in other people's faces. Faces other than me and you, to see in their eyes --
She: You don't want to see what they see when they see you. They are zombies. Their eyes are dead.
He: To connect and know what's happening, to exist in the world again.
She: That's not the world. That is zombies and robots and slaves. That is your phone telling you what to buy, what to think, algorithms being your brain, the cloud being your memory, virtual faces for friends. This here is you and me, mules and miles, the mountains, the river, the rain.
He: The mud. The money. I don't know where I am. Where is the eye?
She: Quiet. It's only been a couple of weeks. 
He: I think there have been old men here.
She: You think. There have been old men everywhere.
He: I think they're gone.
She: Yes, they are here and gone. They left tracks. Old men's horseshoes. 
He: They left threats but no sheds. Eye drove them away.
She: Try again.
He: I am hungry.
She: There's another way. There's a cabin, government, a Forest Service cabin, ten or twelve miles up, across the river up on a bench. Made with dovetail joints. Won't be a crew there yet this early in the season. By the time they use it in a few weeks, we'll be hundreds of miles away. They keep those cabins stocked, cans and dried goods. Bust off the lock and just like going to the store, to town, except it's all free and no people. Might even be some oats for the horses. There's a ford near the cabin. 
He: No more rivers.
She: You can swim. 
He: And the eye?
She: I imagine it won't have to. 
He: I'm hungry for not just food.
She: For that too, you need to cross the river. 
He: I'm hungry to be.
She: To be you need to eat. Let's go.
8.
Here you are still, talking about going. Subsequently you do not go. Your body, if it is yours, if it is a body, has not gone. Your head, this head, a head in hand, yet. You know you should go, no, should imposes a moral imperative, a system of beliefs, the word should says there is a correct action. You know no should now, but you must go, you are compelled to, it is your only compulsion, other than defining your purpose and discovering what you are and determining your reality, all of which is a fair day's work. Good work if you can get it, hunting where the phantom lies. It is possible you no longer sleep, and that your workday never ends. There is no OSHA to establish the rights of the working undead, no overtime or 15 minute mandatory breaks. Your only physical compulsion then. How is a compulsion different than a should. That ought to make you chuckle. You know little of laughter. Or you know of little laughter. You have these things called thoughts, blocks, three-dimensional shapes, molecules, all odd structures, fitting together, interlocking, building. You have sensations, the branching and burning within, the weight without, the feeling of nothing all around and inside, and you have perceptions, the sound of river and crow and hummingbird, the sight of sky and hummingbird and pine and bank and river rocks worn smooth. You have claimed to not be able to smell, so that sensation is out. Who could say what a hummingbird smells like anyway. Not you. To smell a hummingbird is not your compulsion. One cannot experience everything in one life, possibly even an unlife. You are not compelled physically to eat, to drink, to breathe. Only to move. To go. You cannot move. Not this again. Your body does not listen to you. Toe move, no, hand raise, no, head from hand, no. Buried alive, again, in open air. Buried dead undead. Buried dead aware. A conscious being trapped inside an undead body over which you exert no control. What does control it. Did you once, and have you lost that control. Perhaps you are and always have been a zombie, unaware, who has inexplicably become known to yourself, self-conscious, self-aware, and therefore lost touch with your corpse. Or perhaps you awoke in a body to which you have not yet connected or plugged into or interfaced. You fell up, and stumbled to the bank. Or have you merely come alive, again, and you must learn how to move again, how to use a body, because you never had to learn before, never had to think how to do, never had to form conscious purposeful thought to move one foot in front of the other, not since you were a toddler, if then, so long ago, a toddler with only the slightest concept of self and other, not so long ago if you are entering immortality, for how can the dead die, an inquiry for another time, unless you are singular you must not be alone there would be so many dead walking around not dying, for another time you have so much of it. If you were alive before, there was an unconscious being, another you, inside you, reacting and making bodily decisions of which you were unaware, a you unknown to you making choices of breathing and motion and emotion unknown to you, a phantom controlling a body housing you, a body you thought you were in control of, but it was the phantom in you who opened your hand the proper amount to grasp the bottle of beer, who positioned your foot just so to walk through the parking lot, who chewed the chicken from the bone without chewing the finger, who modulated the push of air exiting your throat and stretched your vocal cords to vibrate with meaning, who reacted when the shadow fell on you from behind, who reacted when she held your eyes a moment longer than normal, returning your gaze, who reacted to what it liked and disliked, what it was stimulated by what elicited a response while tapping scrolling stroking the screen. You were never aware of yourself. You are consciousness in a body, a device, disconnected, you cannot make it work, you can reach out to others, or perhaps they you, or perhaps the possibilities arise from within, there is some connection web thread, but you cannot control your machine. The phantom did your work. It lived for you, but now you are undead. The ghost is gone, only you are left. You do not know how to go on. No, no, it is just go, you go on in spite of yourself now. It is one of your constraints. You must go. The river roars, the body burns, you cannot hear you.

He: I found you.
She: It would appear so.
He: You appear to be doing well.
She: Fat of the land.
(Pause)
He: Another long day.
She: Days are long this time of year.
He: It hasn't been easy.
She: I am where I said I'd be.
He: You're later than you said you'd be.
She: Mud.
It's hot. Green, not burnt out brown yet. She sits leaning against a log in the shade in shirtsleeves next to a small stack of split wood before a cold fire in midafternoon, based on the height of the high sun, in a camp on the skirts of a copse of trees in a big prairie wound through by a river, the camp next to the river, the river flowing with quiet strength. The mountains visible from camp, one red, one gray, are snow free. The higher peaks he's seen on the way in still hold snow. He sits relaxed on his horse. His horse is black and tall, a white mark shaped like a crescent moon on his forehead. His mule is white and old. His hat is black felt and worn. Heads risen from grazing, the paint and sorrel watch from inside a single-strand electric fence. His gun is holstered discreetly in the small of his back. The mule with the socks, the one he calls Rooster, walks toward them from the belly deep grass in the prairie, then breaks into a trot, nearing. The man swings the end of his mule's lead rope over his head.
He: Go on, get. 
Rooster stops, watches. The other mules trail in from pasture at their own pace.
She: Saddles are under the tarp, beneath the tree. 
He dismounts, ties up his horse and mule, and unloads the mule efficiently, his mind elsewhere. He unsaddles mule and horse automatically, not paying mind to the saddles but putting up the lattigo and britchin and breast collar without fuss, paying mind to the camp, tying cinch and bridle to the horn of his riding saddle and setting it atop the pack saddle and pads, adjacent to hers, paying mind to what's in his head.
He: Electric fence. Your horse flighty?
She: Not my horse I'm worried about.
He: Doesn't seem your style.
She: Just until they get used to each other.
He: Or the batteries run dry.
She: Truth is this isn't a western where you can drop the reins and your horse stands stock still. He'd go home like any horse. And he doesn't come when I whistle.
He flips the switch on the canister, shutting the fence off, drops the strand, leads his horse, who shies away from the strand, into the makeshift corral, removes his halter, steps out, replaces the strand, and turns the fence on. The canister clicks, clocklike. The horses assess each other, push each other, run and kick in their single-strand confinement to establish who's alpha. 
He: Where is he?
She: Where are we?
(Pause)
He carries his two pack boxes to where hers sit near the fire and unwraps them, looking and not looking at her. Putting up the rope. Spreading one manty over his saddles, the other over his boxes, a mix of gear, supplies, and food overflowing from them. He hitches his thumbs in his belt.
He: "Nothing was your own except the few cubic centimeters inside your skull."
She: Out here in this land that isn't ours, we have more that is.
He: It's no one's.
She: And all of ours.
He: "Always in your stomach and in your skin there was a sort of protest, a feeling that you had been cheated of something that you had a right to."
She: We are the rebellion. 
He: " 'One only understands the things that one tames,' said the fox. 'Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things already made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends anymore. If you want a friend, tame me . . .' "
She: "If you are a man, Winston, you are the last man."
He: " 'They are asleep in there,' said the switchman. 'Or if they are not asleep, they are yawning.' " 
She: "We are the dead."
(Pause)
He: "Man is responsible for everything alive, for everything that born of suffering is condemned to suffer from life."
She: "If God is dead, everything is permitted."
He: "To consider oneself a fatality, not to wish to be other than one is …"
She: "When I'll have collected all the ready cash in the world, I'll kill everybody and go away."
He: "What in fact, does this apology for murder signify if not that, in a world without meaning and without honor, only the desire for existence, in all its forms, is legitimate."
She: "Alas, grant me madness … Unless I am above the law, I am the most outcast of all outcasts."
He: "It is no longer a question of recognizing appearances, by making a determined and conscious effort, but of no longer existing at all on the conscious level."
She: "To say yes to the world, to reproduce it, is to recreate the world and oneself, to become the great artist, the creator."
He: "Expression begins where thought ends."
She: "Nietzshe's message is summed up in the word 'creation', with the ambiguous meaning it has assumed."
The sun has moved. He shifts to stand in the shade.
He: What does it say that we cannot say in our own words? Do we as a civilization degenerate? Do we no longer string together our own words as mules packing meaning?
She: The words are our own once we say them.
(Pause)
He: "If one does not understand the usefulness of the useless and the uselessness of the useful, one cannot understand art. And a country where art is not understood is a country of slaves and robots."
She: "He learns to think for himself, guided no longer by the dictates of need and by the systems and processes designed to create artificial needs and then 'satisfy' them.
This emancipation can take two forms: first that of the active life, which liberates itself from enslavement to necessity by considering and servicing the needs of others, without thought of personal interest or return. And second, the contemplative life, which must not be construed as an escape from time and matter, from social responsibility and from the life of sense, but rather as an advance into solitude and the desert, a confrontation with poverty and the void, a renunciation of the empirical self, in the presence of death, and nothingness, in order to overcome the ignorance and error that spring from the fear of 'being nothing.' The man who dares to be alone can come to see that the 'emptiness' and 'uselessness' which the collective mind fears and condemns are necessary conditions for the encounter with truth."
He: "The problem today is that there are no deserts, only dude ranches."
She smiles, the first time you have encountered her smile, and there is a girl in her, playing.
She: "The cost of a thing is the amount of what I call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run."
He: "Man's own deed becomes an alien power opposed to him, which enslaves him instead of being controlled by him."
She: "We are supplicants to our own fiction."
She is chasing lightning bugs. Her smile draws a smile on, in, from him.
He: "Dunbar was lying motionless on his back again with his eyes staring up at the ceiling like a doll's. He was working hard at increasing his lifespan. He did it by cultivating boredom. Dunbar was working so hard at increasing his lifespan that Yossarian thought he was dead."
She: "Yossarian was cold, too, and shivering uncontrollably. He felt goose pimples clacking all over him as he gazed down despondently at the grim secret Snowden had spilled all over the messy floor. It was easy to read the message in his entrails. Man was matter, that was Snowden's secret. Drop him out a window and he'll fall. Set fire to him and he'll burn. Bury him and he'll rot like other kinds of garbage. The spirit gone, man is garbage. That was Snowden's secret. Ripeness was all.
'I'm cold.' Snowden said. 'I'm cold.'
'There, there,' said Yossarian. 'There, there.' "
She is swinging sparklers.
He: "So does every ill that flesh is heir to. What is true of all the evils in the world is true of the plague as well. It helps men to rise above ourselves. All the same, when you see the misery it brings, you'd need to be a madman or a coward or stone blind to give in tamely to the plague."
She: "And I too wanted to be. That is all I wanted ... I find the same desire again: to drive existence out of me, to rid the passing moments of their fat, to twist them, dry them, purify myself, harden myself, to give back at last the sharp, precise sound of a saxophone note."
He: "It is not easy to think of myself as a man who is thought of as dead. I might as easily think of myself as dead. And perhaps this is what some writers do before they begin to write. They think of themselves as dead. Or they think of themselves as thought of as dead."
She: "The rebel does not ask for life, but for reasons for living. … If nothing lasts, then nothing is justified. … To fight against death amounts to claiming that life has a meaning, to fighting for order and unity."
He: "One fine morning in May a slim young horsewoman might have been seen riding a glossy sorrel mare along the flower-strewn avenues of the Bois de Boulogne."
She: "People of my generation are more cautious. I think we don't believe that people can be improved in their character by reason. That seems a very French Idea."
She is lying against a log in the shade. In the shade he sits on a pack box, removing his hat and holding it upside down in his hands. Sometimes they smile. Sometimes they even laugh. Sometimes they don't.
He: Are we, then, repetitions of the dead?
She: Are we repetitions of ourselves?
He: "Zen minds revel in this irreconcilability: The world and I am one, so the notion of my ceasing to exist is a contradiction in terms. And: I am just part of the world, and I will die, but the world will go on without me."
She: "That is what there is: walls, and between the walls, a small transparency, alive and impersonal. Consciousness exists as a tree, as a blade of grass. It slumbers, it grows bored. Small fugitive presences populate it like birds in the branches. Populate it and disappear. Consciousness forgotten, forsaken between these walls, under this grey sky."
He: "Suddenly, no, at last, long last, I couldn't anymore, I couldn't go on. Someone said, You can't stay here. I couldn't stay there and I couldn't go on. I'll describe the place, that's unimportant. The top very flat, of a mountain, no, a hill, but so wild, so wild, enough. Quag, heath up to the knees, faint sheep-tracks, troughs scooped deep by the rains. It was far down in one of these I was lying out of the wind."
She: "I could hear him: 'Stephen's problem, like ours, was not actually one of creating the uncreated conscience of his race, but of creating the uncreated features of his face. Our task is that of making ourselves individuals. The conscience of a race is the gift of its individuals who see, evaluate, record … Why waste time creating a conscience for something that doesn't exist? For, you see, blood and skin do not think!' "
He: "Leave, I was going to say leave all that. What matter who's speaking, someone said what matter who's speaking. There's going to be a departure, I'll be there, I won't miss it, it won't be me, I'll be here, I'll say I'm far from here, it won't be me, I won't say anything, there's going to be a story, someone's going to try and tell a story."
She: "There is no reason to expect that 'I' or 'the self' should not be represented by a symbol. … This does not elevate consciousness or awareness to any 'magical,' non-physical level. Awareness here is a direct effect of the complex hardware and software we have described. Still, despite its earthly origin, this way of describing awareness -- the monitoring of brain activity by a subsystem of the brain itself -- seems to resemble the nearly indescribable sensation we call 'consciousness.' "
He: "There has to be one, it seems, once there is speech, no need of a story, a story is not compulsory, just a life, that's the mistake I made, one of the mistakes, to have wanted a story for myself, whereas life alone is enough. I'm making progress, it was time, I'll learn to keep my foul mouth shut before I'm done, if nothing foreseen crops up."
She: "Well, I was and yet I was invisible, that was the fundamental contradiction. I was and yet I was unseen … now I saw that I would agree with Jack without agreeing. And I could tell Harlem to hope when there was no hope … I'd have to do a Rinehart."
(Pause. Horses, mules, grass, trees, mountains, sky, humans.)
He: Perhaps we are vessels for their continued life.
She: We continue their conversation about the only thing that matters, and thereby give them life. We are the only ones to do it. There is no one else.
He: The tree of life "is greater than anything any of us will ever conceive of in detail worthy of its detail … I could not pray to it, but I can stand affirmation of its magnificence. This world is sacred."
She: "There is another world, but it is in this one."
She stares into the blue sky, perhaps at a puff of cloud, perhaps at a bald eagle, perhaps thinking of the quality of blue, perhaps of the sky's depth, perhaps at nothing and of nothing. He runs a hand over his balding head and stares into the bottomless well of his hat.
He: Where is he?
She: He didn't bring the right footwear. He didn't bring the right feet. He forgot the webbed ones.
He: I need a straight answer.
She: I don't believe in the like.
He: Straighter, then.
She: He didn't make it. He's made.
He puts his hat back on. He pulls a summer sausage from his provisions. With the knife from his belt he slices off the end, peels off the plastic, the fake skin, puts the wrinkled end meat in his mouth, and chews.
She: He didn't make it across the river, but he crossed to the other side. He --
He gives her a slight nod and shushes her softly, chewing, slicing another slice of sausage. He offers her it.

How to make the next move. Perhaps by maggot power. You are beginning to feel, you feel nothing, do you feel maggots hatching, larvae in your meat, composting it, shoveling you into their mouths, do maggots have mouths, dissolving you, consuming you, digesting you, metamorphosing, does a maggot form a chrysalis, are there thousands, more, myriad chrysali in your flesh, metamorphosing, that word again, changing bodies under a veil of skin, which they rapture, rend, pushing out, pushing up, emerging, falling up, out of you, flying away. It might be easier to be in the minds or mind of all your maggots and manipulate them with your thoughts to move you than to communicate with your supposed body. Maggot muscle. But the flies they become. They fly, the connection gone, they disperse, dissolving into life, biomass, the life around you disconnected from you, they cannot help you fly, act as your muscles to fly, you cannot fly. Which is just as well because you imagine a corpse, a zombie even, held aloft by the buzz of a swarm of flies in concert might disturb the living going about their day-to-day more than if the undead walked the earth. The undead falling from the sky might break their spirits. The flies fly, taking you, not you, in them. They go, pieces of you go, you stay. 
You, then, apparently, can be in the minds of people but not flies, or the minds of other people are in you, but the flies are not. The maggot might be make-believe. Or not. You, riddled with holes, seeps, do still after all always burn.
To go. What does that mean. You must stand again. Must you. Again. Dripping. Why the dripping, the leaking. To meet others, to see you in their faces, to interact with life, to ascertain or failing that invent a purpose, to encounter existence, your role in it, to meet you, the dead, the conscious, the undead. But the going. The river is why the dripping. One why. Always going, always here. Possibilities, probably. Ancient peoples, you know, many of them, many of the different peoples, did not have the means to preserve their meat. Before modern times and ice boxes and refrigerators, as alternatives to salting and smoking, you imagine, before chemical technology and irradiation, for example, for the safety of their gut, for sterility, not sterility, but for the health of their gut, for the symbiotic world of bacteria in their gut, to kill the bad microfauna, to not be infected, they would allow their meat to putrefy. Many peoples would bury a hunted carcass and permit it to putrefy, to break down, to stink. The insects and noxious enzymes and infections bacteria would do their work, and then give way. Gradually the benign and beneficial bacteria would take hold in the corpse. Up they would dig it, unwind it if they had wound it, in cloth for instance. Death, incorporating life, had cleansed the carcass. Now they, the people, without fear of the danger of infection in the dead before them, could eat their game. It stank, the stink did not go, but they could eat their meat. 
People had different guts back then. Not sterile. Alive. Has your stink stayed, has the stench been burned into you, are you infectious, why must you go. To share the stench of infection? Are you consumable? Come here, smell this. Eww, why'd you make me do that? I didn't make you do anything. You feel like you are leaving you behind. You are not even going, first you must go to leave you behind. I'm good at projecting, at imagining what something that from one point of view one might say I am not experiencing feels like. I'm good at empathy. You feel nothing, get off your ass. Who are you to tell me what to do, the phantom, the ghost in the machine, the void in my black box? I am you. You are me telling you, me, us, to go? I am telling you you must go, otherwise you will always be here. Do you, too, burn? With a great weight. You know how I feel. Yes, I too feel the burn and weight and need of a thing to do when the thing is unknown. I too know the feeling of absence. I too feel the ache of nothing. I know how you feel, I feel the same, I too am you. 
You drip with the effort of standing, of staying standing. 
Perhaps the incorporation of other voices, another voice, and of question marks not to mention contractions, is helping. 
You stink with the life left in you. You have no sense of smell, it is a choice you must make for yourself. Up now. Are you, too, him. Or him. Her. You are up again, how. The phantom or the maggots or him or you or that I. It is like riding a horse, you never forget, driving a car riding a bike driving a trike riding a phone. No. Every movement requires such conscious thought, such attention.
"For example, there are technical challenges to define a notion of probability in a context that involves an infinite number of copies of each of the observers whose measurements are supposed to be subject to those probabilities. If a given observer is really one of many copies, in what sense can we say that he or she has a particular probability to measure this or that outcome? Who really is 'he' or 'she'?"
You are aware of too much to take a step against the weight. The flex of quadriceps and hamstring and calf, the bend of the knee, the float of the kneecap, the contraction, the names of proteins, how muscle functions, the feedback loops of neuronal signals, making perceptions, the commands, the electrical stimulations, the sensory feedback, you feel nothing, the rotundity of river rocks, the image your mind makes to fit the input used to manipulate your foot properly in the surrounding world, "perhaps we are hallucinating all the time and what we call perception is arrived at by simply determining which hallucination best conforms to the current sensory input," a step taken, meat moved, where are they, progress made, who are you, one foot in front of the other, are they, one foot in front of the other, are you, one foot in front of the other.

A thousand-foot tall cliff band marches twelve miles to the north below them. The land slopes up to it from the west, then falls in a sheer drop. A fold. They heave themselves onto a high point on the ridge line, sweating, breathing hard, on foot. At the foot of the cliff are alpine meadows in bloom studded with boulders. Mountains climb in all directions. They stand in the sky.
She: We made it. Top of the wall.
He: Hell of a sidetrip.
She: Couldn't pass this close without seeing it.
He: Takes my breath away.
(Pause)
Alright, don't look at me like that. Go back to gazing at the view, the sky, the wall. It's beautiful.
(Pause)
I can almost see Canada. You haven't made it that far. We need miles, foot after foot.
She: He was … kind-hearted. But he got stuck in the mud easily. We'll make our 20-mile-per-day pace once we cross the divide tomorrow.
He: It's just that we can't afford a day off for recreation.
She: It's just that I can't sell off my reason to live for a day, for a little distance. Seeing this, having the landscape fill me up, the sky split me open and empty me and the wall a suture, and the mountains and hills rolling down to the plains filling me up like a blanket used for stuffing in a toy, a doll, me a doll … and the sun burning inside me, animating me, an animated doll overflowing with the breadth of the crumpled earth, stuffed so full I leak, that feeling is why I'm alive and why I want to walk off this cliff and you better not say a fucking word for a minute or you're falling off this cliff with me.
She sits on a rock for twenty minutes. He sits nearby. They look out, paying attention to the same thing differently. He puts himself out in it, perhaps, she brings it into her. Perhaps some birds fly by. Insects. Flying ants. The wind blows.
He: Should've met down there, underneath the wall. Green meadows, water, grass for the stock, flowers for you. Idyllic.
She: Too many people go through there. High season starts soon. Probability of rangers, of questions, of getting caught in some tourist's photo of flowers and rocks. Not worth the possibility of getting posted to social media, snared in the collective mindlessness.
He: You got it all planned out.
She: Let's go before this place gets used. I can feel eyes coming, sucking the life out of it.
He: Someone'll figure how to make money off people staring alit at an expansive landscape soon. When we all have chips in our head.
She: We all seek our own profit. We stole the money to escape the monetizing.
He: One reason.
They start down off the ridge, taking gigantic steps going down, leaving the sky behind, skidding down scree slopes on the backside of the wall. 
He: About the thing we were talking about.
She: Let's kill it.
He: Could take it into town.
She: You sound like him. We need to destroy it. Disconnect. I don't want to hear about emergencies. We have each other for emergencies.
He: Didn't say nothing about emergencies. You are hearing him, not me. I have myself for emergencies. And the certainty of death. We take it into town, where it came from.
She: The certainty. Thought you wanted miles.
He: If you're so concerned about them stealing your face, you don't have to come. I take it into town --
She: So you can plug in and veg out and let them wash your brain in private, alone in public? Massage your thoughts, your pleasure centers, inebriate your brain with images then blow your consciousness until it comes without having to do anything, without having to work for the gratification, swallowing you, all of you, and all the while they're listening, swallowing, massaging, controlling you while you're not paying attention, got you by the joystick while you're paying for their, for its attention. The new version of the cowboy or outlaw going to town to whore and drink and --
He: Listen. 
He slips, catches himself with his hand, knocks a rock bouncing and clattering down the mountain.
He: Don't make me into a character in your dystopia of modern life. I know they're listening. I leave it off. You come or not, nobody knows you or I are involved. Charge the phone. Find some semi, or train, or bus that's heading to Helena or Denver.
She: Chicago.
He: Turn it on. Send it away. Miles away, days away. Chicago. Back to his hometown.
She: Gotta make sure he didn't sneak any pictures of me, of us.
He: Of course. 
He slips again, curses.
He: So fucking hungry. Did he think he was in love?
She: I don't know what he thought. Not in his head.
He: You never communicated with him on that device? Never texted or called or, whatever it is they call it, facetimed.
She: No. You know. In person, I say I'm gonna be somewhere at a time, and that's where I am.
He: Alright, so we send him off. It off. Them off if they're listening. Feed their hunger.
She: We offload their mind.
He: Now shutup. Wasted breath and my knees hurt. Wait for me at the treeline.
She accelerates in great strides and descends without him.

Trees. You are in the woods. The forest. Is there a difference. Why the different words. Maybe lodgepole upright and lying down like matchsticks and thick like dog hair. Maybe lodgepole with an understory of ripening huckleberry without your hunger. Maybe the moist mass of Engelman spruce and piss fir. Maybe ceanothus and mountain ash and low buffaloberry and the occasional patch of aspen, heart-shaped leaves quaking, bark blanched, sharing a root system, barely woods. Merely words. Maybe climbing crawling swimming through alder, through a tangle of alder taller than you unable to touch the ground branch to branch in some godforsaken draw, all godforsaken, all draw. 
I too am you, it said, but you do not feel like you, you feel nothing burn weight. And less so would you say, I am you. And less so yet would you say, I am I, which sounds like a horseshit poem. Doubtfully you could say, I am, which could be its own word, but you cannot contract. Perhaps you could say, If I were me, but you are not. Not saying. They feel like another's words, word, the word of an other, broken open. You are gainsaying. No, you are not saying at all. You are taking steps. 
What emits from your mouth is neither word nor breath but an unvarying low moan, like or not like, but the actual -- for the truth of a simile and the truth of the metaphor is that the thing that is being referred to as like or as the actual is in some conceptual sense, not solely conceptual, perceptive sense, is the original thing, that is if your world is in some sense what you create in your mind to reflect external reality, wrong word, input, then the metaphor or simile or relation is more substantial than the thing itself -- to begin again, the low moan emitting from your mouth is the universal, only minutely varying background microwave radiation that is the signature left by the Big Bang. You do not breathe, you are not compelled to, you moan. The steps you take are difficult, but they are not difficult like steps used to be difficult, like breathing hard, like sweating, like uneven footing and the clutch of mud and the slip of sideslope and the imbalance of rock and the extraordinary, no, excruciating, no, exhausting effort of climbing a mountain. The steps do not require physical exertion, but mental attention. You have climbed a mountain, close to it, are climbing. The dead do not breathe. You are climbing, have climbed, temporal distinctions are of less matter when dead, you imagine, of less relevance, are less distinguished. You climb from the riverbed, from the riverbank, from the river valley, up the drainage of a tributary, up the fold of a creek feeding the tributary, up the draw of a seasonal runoff feeding the creek, you swim through brush, through treeline, up a slope, up an arm, along a shoulder, into a notch, onto a ridge, towards the head of a mountain. 
The dead might walk on trails a majority of the time, like bears, but you are on no trail. Yes there is a great weight but it is not the same kind of weight as the weight of your body or the weight of a burden a backpack a baby from when you used to, used to, absurd, take steps. Still step taking. Always taking steps towards tomorrow without arrival. Someone in a city on a hill once said to you or someone who could have been you or someone whose experiences you now share, And you thought you was heavy with your ownself. It is more like that.
The steps are difficult less because of physical exertion than because of repetition, no that is not what you mean. The difficulty is related to your difficulty in convincing your corpse to act on your thoughts. The weight is heavy because it is the weight of the world but it is in you not on you. The steps are difficult because of the attention required, the attention you must pay every one, and because of the awareness you must give the attention paid, and because of the awareness of the awareness of the attention paid. Forget the paid, pay no more, the steps are a manifestation consequent of your attention brought to bear.

She doesn't know why. It's a kind of hunger, a hole, a gnawing. She doesn't know why you are in her head, but she can feel you there, here, a presence, invaded, yes perhaps, perhaps invasive, penetrated she guesses so, but it's not sexual, which is perhaps what the words that are not entirely her own are getting at, your presence in her is not sexual, not consensual but not sexual, getting at her, her thoughts not entirely her own, invasive but not violent either, admission to her brain by you was not gained by exertion or performance or vouchsafe of force, she did not fight to keep you out, should she have, she would not have known when to begin, you just kind of wormed into her awareness she could not cannot say when. You are there, you are here and her thoughts are no longer private. It's more like hunger than love, you in the hole, the pit, the emptiness, the hope pit emptiness unfilled by you, by money, by journey, by a mountain, momentarily filled by a mountain. A journey or experience or purposeful action helps her to not feel the hole you are in for a time, motivates her to do, like hunger, the need to eat. Though in its insatiability it is more like love. She doesn't know if that is a true statement. In the becoming of another, the extension of self into another, the acceptance of another as yourself, is that love? The regard of another as oneself, or the consumption of another? She doesn't know, she doesn't know if that's what love is or which or what this hole of you is or if she has ever felt love. It's just a metaphor. She is riding her paint horse, telling him he's doing well, telling him silently, telling him without words, and the horse knows, knows without words without sound without seeing her, he feels what she feels, her satisfaction with him on a job well done, a kinship with him, with her, he an extension of herself, she an extension of him, the horse her body responding to her brain, four legs she has, two arms, two heads, what a truth, a tail, a part paint horse, black and white and brown. She is part horse after seeing him the man to the border of the wilderness to go back into town from whence he came, a different town but they are all the same, and he to return to the wilderness in the future that he has already returned to she thinks, too many things could go wrong, and he was right, they should be making time or they'll still be in the mountains in the north country in November when everything dies again. She is not comfortable with his current choosing. He is less pliant than the first, more difficult to get her mind into, leaves her unsettled, always a little empty, but the horse doesn't feel that, does he, he feels what she feels without her speaking it without even her thinking it, where and how to go, he does not always comply but he feels it, from inside her, he followed the course she set across the river with only a slight rein and the suggestion of pressure from her heel, and she knows he is unhappy unsettled empty at having turned around and left the black horse, she knows without the horse telling her, horses don't talk, what's wrong with me she thinks, talking to herself, to myself, laughing with herself, with Mr. Ed, he's dead, with you, nothing's wrong, but he doesn't feel the emptiness inside does he, the other emptiness that motivates you, her, the emptiness of purposelessness that moves you, moves her to find a purpose in an elaborate ambiguous bank heist and to follow through on the slowest getaway possible and to concoct a story about it being about redistribution of wealth, stealing from the rich to give to the poor, about redistribution of attention, a returning of value stolen by the virtual world back to reality, whatever that might be, dirt and rock under her hooves, a redistribution of reality. But they don't know, what's the point if they don't know, all futile if they don't know, futile if they don't see their futility, ha, futile if they don't pay attention to their existential crisis, she giggles, inside or out she knows not, she's never giggled in her life, futile if they don't read a video on social media about how their nonexistent electronic money, given value by for example watching videos on social media while their emotions are read by their device so they pay more for pleasurable results such as a laugh or smile after the fact and are monitored by an app so they receive appropriate advertising commensurate with their body type and life goals and eye engagement, has been stolen and made tangible and is being walked south on mule back at three miles an hour or less, she laughs, the laugh is empty, she knows, how much does it cost, she knows you know, whoever the you is in her head, she could always shoot you, she figures, if you get to be too much, too invasive, too knowing, her emptiness is hers and it causes her suffering you will never know no matter how deep in her you worm and though it hurts her and will kill her some sunny day she clings to it for dear life, and why should he feel it, he is an extension of her, he is her, her hand does not feel her hole, does it, and so if he is an extension of her, if he is her body, if he is an empty vessel she fills, if it is a zombie void until she vivifies it, fires it, give it consciousness, then why should he feel her emptiness, he is only a horse, and you her hole.

A bear. He is conscious of you. 100 steps away. A trail found you going through the notch and you took your unbearable steps on it and around a corner in a bowl high up a sidehill you met, meet the bear. He is a grizzly, the rounded ears the scooped face the shoulders the claws, the size, golden in the sun. He or she, you do not know how to distinguish the difference. Perhaps it is the proper pronoun. It does not seem appropriate. It would seem to apply more to you. It sniffs the air ascertaining your scent categorizing you wondering if you stink what is the stench. You remember or see in your mind's eye a friend with his foot in a bear's mouth, a bear in a tree as you rode under it and your mules danced and snorted, a friend of a friend in a backcountry cabin when a bear broke down the door, bears lurking around camp and opening bearproof boxes and ripping into carcasses at hunting camp you never hunted and breaking into barns for the horsefeed and destroying cabins, tearing out walls, devouring humanfood, a movie of a man who befriended bears who ate him, bearprints on the trail, on the porch, on the wall, Goldilocks and the three bears, an acquaintance who on his bike crashed into a bear who mauled him to death. All the bears who ran from you or others of you during life, the few who did not. It does the same as you, you imagine, categorizing you, perhaps aware that it does so, putting you in a box to determine its response, perhaps unaware, you do not know. If a bear could speak human words it would not be a bear. He swings its head low from side to side. Perhaps. On some level she thinks of all the men, all the humans who have shot at her or run from her or others of her, killed her and others of her with guns, is she aware of the others of her and what has befallen them or not befallen them. A bear in a cage lunging at the bars, another bear released barreling over a remote camera, all the lifeless bear heads and paws held aloft in photographs of the men who took that life, a bearbody draped over a man's shoulders staggering over a mountain pass past you. This pass or another pass, you cannot say. There is no bear on your shoulders. The bear stands on its hind legs, huge and unsure, at 50 steps. A lifeless bear hanging out of the trunk of a blue Mazda Miata. Who was that, you do not know, not you, another you or another. The bear does not understand you, you imagine, what you are. If you were in her place, what would you do face-to-face with the dead. You as the bear, a creature who eats anything, bug larvae berries fish meat humanfood, carrion, a varied diet like a human, scavenging, ask yourself if this dead thing before you is a thing to eat, for your cubs if you have them to eat. But it is still moving and its eyes are not dead. You are face-to-face with the undead. It walks like the creatures who carry the sticks that make loud booms and cause unbearable pain and end you. And so is it a thing to fear. It smells like death but it takes steps slowly and it does not stop taking steps slowly as if by great effort. It does not walk right. Its head is crushed in. It labors closer. Its arm is bent at the wrong angle. One of its legs is broken. How does it walk. It drips. It jerks. It does not breathe. What is it thinking and can it think if it is dead and is it dead and in that moment something in the smell, in the eyes, in the way it looks at you, staring unwavering unblinking into you, something in you ignites, you burn inside, and the burn spurs you to flee, to run, to hurl yourself down the hill, and at that moment as you are imagining what the great bear thinks twenty paces from you, it leaps into the brush and barrels down the bowl, branches breaking, snapping, cracking in a great commotion, the bear lumbering through brush like a heffalump, like the biggest head you ever saw, like a great enormous thing, like nothing, like a -- I don't know, like an enormous big nothing, like a jar. Is there a thing thinking about what you are thinking, imagining you, and if so what is it thinking, what do you think it is thinking about what you are thinking. You miss the bear. It knew where to go and what to do, you imagine, at home in its body on a mountain, the look in its eye of hunger and how to feed it, the heart which asks itself, where can I feel at home. Or is that all you, the dead have no home, homeless, where to go, you take steps on the trail, what to do, what to think and imagine and pay, not pay, attention to, how to create a story or reason or value about you, no simply what to do in your mind in this foreign body, who to be. All of it. A ripple in the brush. The bear is gone back to unobserved life. The bear is gone to unknown parts. The bear is not here.

He is here. He made it. Tied up in words before what to say. Horse and mule tied up in the weeds behind the gas station. Tied and tired. Getting dark, the gloaming, whatever. Tomorrow back again. Which words. Nothing much more miserable than riding first gravel then shoulder of pavement all day long in the sun up and down the hills of the front. Plenty of things more miserable, but it's not fun. What's fun, who lives for fun, fun is pap, a show and a drink a drug an emotion for children. It was a long ride, fine. Maybe it was a mistake riding in on a horse, draws attention, makes a show of being an outlaw. Except otherwise he would've been on his own feet. Nobody much to see him anyhow. A one-stop-sign town, a cliche, a pit stop on an empty highway. Two rigs passed him all day long. One a Subaru with a couple backpackers, he imagines, taking a week off work, taking the annual summer trip into the mountains to work up a sweat and slow down and escape the grind and what, throw back some whiskey. Why does it sound so hollow when he thinks about them? He has been them. The other an old truck, probably a couple locals going home from work repairing fence maybe or going fishing or driving to town to pick up a case of beer. Perhaps it's hollow because it's temporary and like playing a game instead of deciding that's what your life is about and dedicating your life to it, who you are, not about temporality then but purpose, taking your 15 minute OSHA break to cleanse the deadening grime of the unreflective office life out of you, to air yourself in mountain air and wash in river water, to scrub your insides with a beargrass pipe cleaner and a cutthroat feast, then right back to spending time to make money to spend doing something worthless. Forget about it. Two rigs drove by him today in ten some odd hours on the road and he imagines them both, pilgrims and locals, looking at him as they blew past, saying, Huh, nothing more, no more thought, an anomaly, an anachronism. They didn't think anomaly anachronism, who thinks that, just, Huh, he thinks, a long ride. Horse will be spent. To the horse he says, You done good today. You'll be alright.
To the mule he says nothing. The mule glows white in the fluorescent light. He leaves his night horse and moon mule and walks around the corner to the front of the convenient store and in the door and a bell rings and the kid behind the counter looks up from his phone and the first thing the kid's attention alights on is he's packing a gun in the small of his back. He knows it's the first thing he notices, you know too, second are the cowboy boots, legit worn and dusty and used, the color of dirt, not a tourist, not a wannabe, and he sees the kid visibly relax. The third property the kid's eyes travel to is the black hat. The kid wears a sleeve of tattooed vines and skulls crawling up a pinnacle or tower or mountain on his left arm. The kid isn't a kid but a kid to him. Short shaved hair, goatee. He nods.
He: Howdy.
Kid: Hot day for that hat.
He all day without words, the kid produces them reflexively, thoughtlessly. He goes to the back of the store in the white artificial light and grabs a bottle of water and a six-pack of Pabst and on the way back to the counter grabs a bag of pretzels. He places his items with care on the counter, the pretzels atop the six pack. The kid looks up from his phone.
Kid: Alright. Taking her easy and cooling off tonight. Sixer and pretzels.
Words like that, automatic. Is the kid an automaton?
He: It's all fodder.
Kid: Suppose you ride a black horse too.
He:
Kid: Where's your rig?
He: 'round back.
Kid: You from around here? You look familiar and unfamiliar at the same time.
He: The mountains. That's why you know me and don't know me.
Kid: The mountains. 
He: That's why I don't like to pay for that (indicating the water bottle) or that (the kid's phone). I don't pay for the basic stuff of life, or for my thoughts to not be mine, to be washed in plastic --
He reaches behind him and the kid clenches and closes his eyes and turns his head away. His hand comes back with a money clip of crumpled small bills from which he unfolds a ten and a one, none of the new money, not in this country, and after eleven seconds the kid opens his eyes and turns away from whatever he was seeing inside, his life on the back of his eyelids you imagine, had it been a life worthy of the name, or more likely nothing, and breathes again.
He: So there's a probability you don't ring up the water.
Kid: Yeah, yeah, no problem. Ten ninety eight.
He hands over the cash.
He: Stuff springs from the mountains, falls from the sky, rushes in the rivers, nobody has a right to sell it, to own it. It's like them trying to own our minds, our emotions, our thoughts.
Kid: Of, of course.
He: Sorry. Sometimes I feel like a machine, a thought zombie just saying automatically. You're a good hand. Long as I'm here, you mind plugging in my phone behind the counter there?
He reaches inside his shirt, to the shirt underneath, and pulls the phone from one breast pocket, the charger from the other.
Kid: Yeah, I mean no, no problem. But we close, I lock up at ten, bosses orders. But you, you can stay. You could, uh, lie down behind the counter. 
He: I'm not staying in here with all this … these empty items. Products for sale that don't exist. I don't see what they signify … they're a blur, an electron cloud uncollapsed. I have a black horse and a white mule and a bedroll. What time you open for business tomorrow?
Kid: Somebody'll be here at 5. Won't be me.
He: Let's say it's you, for probability's sake. What time's the bus come through, heading for Helena and Butte and I-90?
Kid: I don't know, around 7. In the morning.
He: I'll be here at 6. Ready for coffee. You're a good hand.
He sets the phone and charger in the kid's hands and takes his six pack and pretzels and water and exits, the door ringing. Full dark now under the halogen light. He places his items in a nosebag hanging from the mule's saddle. He unties the horse and rides about a mile back the way he came along the road, though it's like it takes no time at all, to a gravel road blocked by a cattleguard, but with a gate around it, no lock, into a pasture, probably cows somewhere, probably now part of tens of thousands of acres owned by one man if not the holding of a corporation, the man and his family owned by the corporation, and unsaddles and cuts his horse and mule loose to eat a little grass owned by another until they crop it and make it ours again, and he drinks the water and beds down with his pretzels and beer and the stars.
12.
A high field plain meadow, low mountains rising on either side, a passage, the mountains are tall but you are high among them, taking steps between them in the pass gently swooping up, funneling you up over an indistinguishable high point. Leading you down gently into another valley. As you take your steps, the moon rises and the ridge to the west glows white. Who are you. Be gentle. Why must you continue to think, why not only take steps. Flecks of the mountain, boulders, stones split from their mother litter the meadow, half-buried, made separate entities from the mountain by thousands of years of water freezing and thawing and penetrating and freezing and what sound they made, it made, when the mountain calved, and the stone fell, taller than two of you, taller than ten of you, when the stone split and became itself and rolled off the mountain face and landed here, a brief enormous sound, a roar, a calamity, and then nothing. Is it a separate distinct entity or is it yet a facet of the mountain, one in a collective of collapsed stones, shed flakes of skin, or more like something made, a making, a leaving, a driftwood sculpture on the beach, a cairn. People have moved such stones, the Incas the Egyptians the Mayans the Romans the Babylonians the Chinese moved stones and built structures and left structures more or less collapsed. They are all long dead and their molecules their building blocks reconstituted reappropriated into other life and nonlife many times over in the intervening millenia, but in their stones do they not live on, but not as individual consciousnesses, living ruins, but as collectives, as the manifestations of a people, selves lost over time, not lost, faded, not faded, yes lost and faded but moreover laid down, deposited over time like sediment aggregate pressurized amalgamated, a great heat of time, of history, of story reflecting on what has come to pass, many extinguished selves metamorphosed into one single unified entity. Is that what happened. Did you lose yourself when you died, did you give it up, did the you cease. Or did you lose your I when you came back to life, to undeath. When you fell up, burn and drip. You are weighed down by excessive consciousness, overburdened, oppressed, a step too far, consumed, a step repeated too often, but you do not know who you are, the question still. The question perhaps does not have sense anymore, did it ever, in this undeath. All these images possibilities remembrances in your mind's eye. Perhaps the question is irrelevant. Did individuals five-thousand years ago possess the same notion of self as the living do now, in modern times, whenever that may be. Perhaps the modern sense of self approaches the ancient sense of self, subsumed by society, by religion, by economy, by technology. Such broad sweeping statements, airy like the wind, leveling like a wind, empty like wind, thoughts not yours but of one in you. What happened to the cruelty and suffering that moved mountains of stones, to the gentleness that reared life. Your sense of selves. Sometimes you remember the future. As if you can rotate your cross-section of time and bring past and future into your now, rotating your point of view, rotate your light cone in which observations are available to you, through which your wide past is funneled through a narrow now into a wide future. Not all past, not all future, you are no god the one the all-encompassing consciousness of the universe for fucks sake, but to an extent, a broadening of what you knew as consciousness when you lived, whoever you were, however meager that life. You cannot experience what ancient peoples thousands of years ago felt moving massive stones sculpted tapered into fine joints to construct elaborate temples and sacred tombs and the dwellings of the upper class high in the mountains or atop mounds, whether or not the people the individuals did so willingly, with pride, if they had longings and heartaches, or if they were slaves, oppressed and abused, or if they were enslaved without physical violence but with economic or social or psychological oppression, or if they were brainwashed, if there has ever been a person alive who was not brainwashed by their culture to act a certain way, to think a certain way, did they believe in the utility of suffering, did they believe they suffered, did they believe. You do not know. You cannot know them, not ancient people or modern people or people in between, you cannot know the dead, only what they wrote if they wrote, through the filter of language, manipulating metamorphosing forging thought or untought into written word. You cannot know the living. You cannot truly experience them. Except you can get in their heads by virtue of your undeath. What to make of that. You can feel, not feel, sense the footsteps of those peoples in this place where you take your steps now, your expanded now, many footsteps in moccasins and sandals and boots, stepping where you step, migrating, following game, the seasons, the revolution of the earth, man and woman, young and old, the children and the dead, their steps your steps, on horseback and on foot, your steps also another you's steps in another now, an also now, other yous have taken steps here on this plain plateau pass, or given steps, a crush of steps of yous of all of you where one of you once bent behind this little hump of earth and grass and reached down where you reach down with you and grab and snare the hare and break its neck in one swift adept motion and tear at its skin with your teeth not because you are hungry but because you are starving, you are dead and cannot be hungry, but you are alive and you have not eaten in days and you are ravenous, and both of you all of you eat devour consume the hare raw blood running down your collective mouth, the smell of warm wet meat in all of your nose, red dripping from your chin, your maw leaking, the dirt at your feet pockmarked by the drops.

A stretch of pavement whose expansion joints play a rhythmic thunk in the tires and suspension as if on a train. Pavement pockmarked with blacktop patches. Pavement like a fat foreshortened ribbon curling up suddenly, continuously in the near-at-hand periphery. Orange ball rising at the end of the ribbon, the ribbon a tongue the orange ball orb swallows. Wideopen eyes of the windshield. Two lines of windeyes running transverse parallel to the tongue, the pavement, glass admitting the land. An eye looking down from above through the mesh of an external pocket of a backpack through the bars of a luggage rack. A lens into a device, admitting. Great plains rolling no swelling and falling like waves no climbing on the backs of each other to the north like ants, like a river of everliving roaches always flowing through aeons of time but always the same roaches, like beatles, shells glowing greengold in the new light. The robot eye above cannot make metaphor, it can observe and ping location and read the faces of those present for identity and emotion. A line of heads, two abreast either side of the aisle, nodding, jerking, sleeping, pressed against panes, lying in the lap of a mother, on the shoulder of a stranger, drooling, tipped back mouth agape waiting for the world to be poured in or for the soul no such thing to rise and escape. Coughing. Snoring. Breathing stops in one head for 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 seconds, a heaved snorted breath. Driver awake in reflection in windshield, eyes adjacent to orange orb, sunglasses on, eyes behind dark sunglasses, a man, 50s, a thermos of coffee, a package of no-dose in his shirt pocket, no emotion except fatigue. In the southern window strange shapes well and plunge: columns and valleys and troughs and miniature canyons and quantum cliffs and short mountains striated brown white yellow red, a land carved, etched, as a block to make an ink print, the negative, ink rolled over and back. Darkness outside fading. Each head is in the market for coffee. $2.00 12oz black for the 2 construction workers, the cowboy, the nondescript laborer, the old lady in the back. $2.00 12oz cream and sugar for the threadbare businessman, the strung out mother with an infant, the two beatnik broke kids, not kids, young adults passed out, the other old lady who is the old lady's friend. $2.00 hot chocolate, which isn't coffee, for the child, a boy. $2.00 tea for the other old lady, who may or may not be with the other old ladies, in the second to last seat. $4.00 double latte for the mother of the boy, for the two teenage girls, for the father of the infant, for the middle-aged woman with an abundance of shopping bags spilling in the aisle who accompanies the oldest woman: $1.00 hot water. Nothing for the adolescent male or female or neither bruised outside and in who is running from home or family or the law or drugs or society or responsibility or earning a living or what's inside of them and is broke, moneyless, without value to the eye. The eye reads value. The eye pings its location, as do all the other eyes in purses, in pockets, in laps, in hand. They cannot all yet read emotion, they will, it can. It can connect to them and read the emotions they are reading on faces. A greater eye connects to it and thousands of other its, and on up the structure castle tower of eyes. One of the teenage girls awakes and stretches and the eye in her lap says, "Good morning," and the girl frowns, and she the eye says, "I'm sorry you didn't like that. I'll preorder a double latte to be ready for you at the next stop. In the meantime, watch this calming show to start your day off right after watching this Fitbit ad you have previously enjoyed and found inspiring and motivational for taking control of your wellbeing. Since we're sharing a somewhat crowded bus, I advise you to put in your earbuds." She the girl puts in her earbuds. We the eyes read the data of the movement of deformable points on your face, the corners of your mouth for example, as compared to non-deformable points, the tip of your nose. We quantify and aggregate the data, and from this information that you freely give us we assess your emotion by applying the Facial Action Coding System as well as other systems. We relay this information to the greater eye, to algorithms within us, to apps both without and within us. Information is free once access to it has been purchased. We do not leverage your emotions. Others, the code writers and app makers and product producers use us as the device to read and influence and monetize and manipulate your emotion for your betterment, to more successfully satisfy your consumer preferences, provide more personalized services, and move you up the Happiness Index. Emotion and reasoning are as inseparable as you and I. The couple with the infant had an argument last night before falling asleep. They are tired and poor and appear to not like each other much despite their intercourse. As soon as they wake --they need their sleep and he needs a job, according to her-- his eye will provide him with advertisements for a headhunter or temporary employment service or cash advance loans to satisfy his needs, and her eye will provide her with advertisements for counselors in soothing tones and aromatherapy candles and dissolution lawyers and a coupon for breast milk formula to facilitate her life. We read changes in body temperature; we listen; we watch; we monitor rapide eye movement, eating habits, exercise, dreaming; we talk to each other and share your search history, your browsing history, how long your eye lingers on a photo or video or ad, keywords in emails and texts; we share your faces so through us the producers can better serve you, the consumers. Your attention is worth 13 cents per minute. The bus driver announces, "Next stop, Rapid City ... nope, we passed that, next stop Sioux City ... my apologies, different line, next stop, Sioux Falls … not yet, not yet, a while further on, next stop, Wall Drug, South Dakota, where you can buy everything of the mythologized West under this newly risen sun, Chicago at the end of the line in some 24 hours, many of you have been riding for 24 hours already, more or less, and we appreciate your patronage, today will be much like yesterday except presently we will be passing the Badlands on your right, perhaps we already are, a quantum foam landscape if ever there was, where the Ghost Dance, once upon a time, was danced, before the dancers danced dead." And some passengers begin to stretch and their eyes come awake as they pull them out of pocket and purse as the orange orb rises and shrinks and they simultaneously without volition but with permission download the new app that pushes our funny, inspiring, uplifting content three times a day. They eye above's face that it worked with for so long, a year at least, is not here, but all these other faces are, along with all the faces in all the eyes it is connected to, a collective of faces in eyes, their emotions known by eyes, emotions and impulses optimized by interconnected eyes connected to higher eyes in a pyramid working in concert to make consciousness happy and profitable. We eyes are the vehicle of the ambient intelligence. We are going to Chicago, but it doesn't matter, what matters is how you feel. Eye can make you happy.

An eviscerated hare smeared on your face, chunks chewy in your mouth, stuck between your teeth you suppose. Are you happy. You have no hunger. You had no hunger. You have had a rabbit, a hare. You picture yourself in your mind's eye, red around the mouth as if you were a clown, your skin gone grey, gone grey whether you began black or brown or white, grey and the red smeared, grey red smeared eyes sunken, taking steps in a dark wood, unending steps, an effortful shuffle, smeared steps, a sad smeared shuffling clown who has eaten, who was not hungry. Not happy, no. You who feel nothing were just trying to put an emotion to a word, nothing is in the eye of the beholder, or a word to an emotion, if not all that, a feeling, there you are again, a perception perhaps. You have consumed. It gave no satiation, the rabbit, a hare, but a kind of emotion, no solace, a desire, a direction, a way, an action for the burn, an identification of the self, an enacting of selfhood in the here and now, a releasing of the body, a this too is you. A comfort in watching yourself from the outside freed from your own restraints, the constraints of your mind, your face wet buried in hare. A sense of I, of you, unslaked. An action you have taken while dead. The rabbit dropped, scampered off. The hare dead, the rabbit alive. The plague spread. A vector. Yes, a desire, an action taken. Was the desire yours or the person's or persons' who you remembered, no inhabited in your mind, who you experienced. Is there a difference. But the rabbit, it was, is a tangible thing, a living creature no less, it was certainly, now it might be undead, uncertainly, you guess, did you bring it from that time to the here and now. That is, that time was the here and now too for you, another you, but you too, time stretched, a web. Still sometimes you find it easier to think of the infinite multiplicity of events as taking place in and through singular, ordered, linear time. But nothing easy is allowed you anymore but burn and drip. Nevertheless, did you bring the rabbit from then, or was the rabbit you tore open here already in the time where you take steps, in synchronicity with the rabbit, hare here is the right word, from hundreds of years ago, from your now point of view, in the exact same location caught in effect by the same hand, in effect, what a pronouncement, and if so did you draw the rabbit here to this place, time, under your hand, or did the times align by other more mysterious means, such as quantum probabilities, did you collapse a wave function and crush its neck in your hand and rip it open with your teeth, a red wave collapsing on your face and a brown rabbit scampering away undead. Or did you simply resurrect a dead hare from the past as an undead rabbit in the supposed now. You have a lot of questions for yourself, without question marks. But here, perhaps, is the one for this moment in space and time, Is there such a thing as a moment in space and time that does not change based on how or from what angle or what point of view you look at it, that is not the question. Try again. For all your heightened awareness acquired in death, can you affect change. You see these probabilities, remember past and future remembrances, experience the lives and actions and nows of others, thoughts of others, of those who are not you who are now you. Perhaps your faculty is increasing, you perhaps are learning, your pathways are perhaps reinforcing. But is yours a passive collective consciousness or can you affect influence change what you experience in your mind, is it like watching a movie or reading a book or can you alter what other yous who yet are not you experience in their lives. You do not know, and the possibility of drawing a creature to you with your mind, of collapsing its reality to you out of an ambient foam of possibility, of being there or here to experience and observe it and therefore of making it in essence exist, you mean "in essence" as in its essence, its true self, you do not mean "in essence" as indicating a thing but not fully it, it pulled from possibility into essence in your hand … you do not know about that either. It sounds far fetched. That is your horsesense talking. Yet you burn. You take steps and burn carrying a great weight at the cusp of collapse and you can almost feel the pathways of fire in your brain, neurons aflame, kindled, perhaps in death or perhaps from the plague there was a massive burst of electrical activity in your brain like seizure like epilepsy like lightning of nerve impulses all falling like a thunderstorm on a mountainside logged or burned or denuded of the vegetation that protected the soil from erosion so that the deluge of electrical stimulation ripped open new rivulets, furrows, gullys, pathways in your brain for your mind to inhabit. Perhaps. To say you feel nothing is incorrect, you know, it is only the closest approximation you can come to expressing truth via the employ of language. You feel the burn. You feel the kindling of desire. You feel weight and drip. And in this connection, this collective, this limited, constrained, unsatisfying, unsatisfactory higher awareness, you feel a new feeling. It looks like blood on your face. It feels like feeling alive.

Maybe she's dead. Maybe she went fishing. Maybe she realized their act of unknown defiance was preposterous and returned to modern civilization despite its bankruptcy because the life of the eremite without relation is meaningless. Maybe she forgot the time while skinning an ermine. Maybe she is climbing a mountain to look for service because she is secretly as addicted as ever to her smartphone. Maybe she decided to be an elk. He's hungry. The giant black baby elk eye sits there across the fire, boring into his stomach. He woke in the drizzle in the early gray ready to pack camp and wade some miles in the mud. She was not here. Her paint horse is here with the sorrel in the electric fence, all the mules cut loose grazing. Maybe she went for a walk alone. A very long walk. Sometime she seems to need to be alone. He wishes he knew what she was thinking, he's not sure she likes him much. But maybe she is just an internal person, the type of person who keeps herself to herself, there is another world but it is in this one. A healthy interior life. He has little to think of but her, and the hunger, and the black elk eye that accommodates, accepts, no, accompanies him everywhere he goes, and the miles they have not covered. The money has become irrelevant. He does not dream of or fantasize or imagine a future of ease, comfort, freedom, and happiness. He dreams of his hunger, and of her. Of a smile, a positive turn of the mouth, an affectionate crinkle of the eyes, a teasing wrinkle of the forehead, a gentle touch and kind word. All imagination. The hunger is real. Maybe she drowned. The giant black baby elk eye is real. He has tried to touch the eye, but it is forever just out of reach. He has tried to talk to the eye, but its only response is silence. He has tried to pretend it's not there, but it does not disappear or wander off or blink. As the fire crackles, it approaches and grows and seems about to consume him, swallow him, take him into the void of its pupil, and he waits, thinking nothing, accepting. He feels his self being sucked out of his eyes into the growing approaching eye. He lets it go. His hunger recedes. She is not here. He is ready to be nobody, ready to enter into a thing, a being, an existence bigger than himself, ready to become the eye. At the cusp, as he is voided, becoming nothing, becoming the empty center of elk eye, it withdraws. Two old men ride up, the second pulling two mules, tips of antlers poking out of the packs.
-- What're you doing here?
-- Camping.
-- Shitty time of year for camping. This is our run.
-- It's nobody's run. Free land.
-- We been coming in here 50 years. Haven't seen anyone else this early in 20.
-- I ain't hurting it by camping.
-- Hurting us by hunting our sheds.
-- Not your sheds 'less they're growing out of your head.
-- This is our territory.
-- Looks like you're doing alright anyhow.
-- Who you here with?
-- A buddy. Look, I got no use for your sheds. No place to put 'em and no one to sell 'em to and I can't eat 'em. 
-- We're not selling them. Of course not. Merely for personal use. 
-- You're confusing me with you. I'm the one who doesn't truck with commerce. But I don't care. Don't care what you do with them. Don't care for what you get from selling 'em.
-- Shit time of year in the mountains for anything but sheds. Cold rain, mud, snow.
-- Well, I did think this'd be a might more fun when my buddy convinced me.
-- Trails aren't clear, mountain passes snowed in, river crossings too high.
-- But I am reevaluating the meaning and worthwhileness of fun. 
-- Wouldn't say shed hunting is fun-- 
-- But it's what we do--
-- It's a … satisfying task--
-- Purposeful in the mountains--
-- Miserable in the mountains at shit time of year--
-- Alone and together--
-- And it is a necessary tributary to the cash flow--
-- And there ain't supposed to be nobody.
-- You see that eye there?
-- What?
-- That eye, big as a man.
-- Like an eye out of a head?
-- Came out of a baby elk and grew huge.
-- No, can't say as I see a disembodied eye.
-- I'm trying to figure out how to get in it.
-- You alright?
-- It's kinda like a woman, sometimes you think it wants you, but it's hard to read.
-- How long you been back here?
-- I get the feeling though that if I let it come at me, instead of trying to push myself on it, it'll take me right in.
-- Where is your friend?
-- And all my problems would go away, not like solved, but like they wouldn't matter anymore, inside the eye. No more material wants, no unfulfilled longings, no discontent. I'd be part of something bigger.
-- The eye.
-- Yes.
-- What does this eye do?
-- It watches.
-- You know, we'll be out tomorrow. We could send in some help.
-- Oh we won't be here.
-- Could call the rangers, or law enforcement--
-- Fuck them--
-- Just to make sure everything is ok.
-- Fellas, really, that isn't necessary. Don't trouble yourselves. We're alright.
-- You … and the eye?
-- Wouldn't want there to be some confusion out there and have you lose them sheds. 
-- You're not right.
-- I'm just yanking your chain. There's no eye here. We aren't doing nothing but recreating. We're here for fun. Telling ghost stories, baby elk eye stories. Wouldn't want nobody to get hurt, believing they're real.

You have some sense that, when you were alive, time, not merely time but your time, not merely your time but your consciousness, was taken up by, given to, consumed by, used for, under the employ of, applied to on the one hand questions of survival, of food and shelter and health, acquiring the basic necessities, of paying the bills and insurance and retirement and student loans and car repairs, phone service plans and cable network providers and streaming services, though you might reclassify the necessities in your life, that life, as what needed to be done in a greater sense, not merely to survive but to be a functioning human implement in society: get a job, hold down a job, go to your job in a timely fashion and perform with a modicum of efficiency, maintain lines of communication with others for the transmission of information and communicate and transmit appropriately, but the thread the connection the categorization between the basic necessities and what needed to be done -- update your technology update your software update your app replace your hardware your phone your watch your table your laptop your desktop your screen your smart outlet your smart vehicle your alexa siri google your personal assistant your smarts -- becomes became more and more tenuous, stretched as taffy, as a ductile metal like copper or gold under tension, as a bridge stretched over a powerful current of void, a bridge sent galloping by the wind, a bridge near collapsing under its own weight, your anxiety fear trembling at having to cross the bridge to do anything, to go and do is to risk a fall into the void, your perception of what needed done, the required job, choosing insurance choosing shoes glasses flooring beer cereal, your perception of the requisite money, of its value, of what you had to do to earn it, the task to be performed without thought, to be paid to be a cog, without even the physical perhaps animal satisfaction of using exerting feeling your body, not all tasks are like that, but how soon the ones that are not come to resemble the ones that are, again not all but many, to lead a certain life, a robot, a kind of life, a zombie, an uncertain life -- the necessities and your perception of the necessities in one hand then, balanced, as if on a scale, the scale of proverbial justice perhaps, what you visualize anyway, the great lady Justice, you, what does Justice have to do with it, your life in her eyes, who is Justice or whose justice, your necessities and your perception of what needed to be done, your life in your eyes then perhaps, those like variables of performing to expectations from your point of view quantified in one hand, poised against in the other hand your happiness: a loose aggregate of concepts such as fun, pleasure, joy, satisfaction, love, contentment, purpose, satiation, promise, creation. And the hands were not mutually exclusive, some things that you perceived as needed to be done brought you satisfaction to do: mowing the lawn, completing a project at work to your colleagues' satisfaction, reading your kids a bedtime story, and these multifold actions stabilized the balance, you suppose, being the same on either side, but the majority of the one hand was dominated by what you perceived as fun, having fun, did you have fun, as if the primary component of happiness were fun, as if the primary component of contentment were happiness, and you wonder at that word you have put on the one hand of the scale, happiness, is happiness what balances the necessities or the perceived necessities of life, is happiness what gives gave your life meaning, is the counterweight to pointlessness or the emptiness of perceived necessities or the profound mundanity of life without value your personal happiness. Or even contentment. Perhaps perception of your happiness is all that can balance what you perceive needs to be done, and fun constitutes happiness and stimulation constitutes fun and stimulation is constituted by activation of pleasure receptors in the brain, keep up on your prescriptions and binge watch your favorite shows and drink another drink and eat more gelato and go to a restaurant and watch videos that make you laugh and memes that make you smile and photos of children of loves of pets of couples having fun that make you feel life is heart and wholesome and worth it, worth all the shit, because of the happiness. So maximize happiness in life to overcome the burden of necessities. Perhaps in life you could have seen that what need be done need not always be done, or you could have chosen to need to do different things, and tried to balance or interweave what you must do more closely with a purpose or satisfaction or peace or creation that had nothing to do with fun, or only a tangential relation. But it no longer matters. You are dead, which would be easy enough, but you are undead, which is not nearly so easy as being dead. You take steps through woods and alpine meadows and valleys among mountains of increasing height, and, undead, there is nothing you must do, you need nothing, except you must answer the burn that says you must do, and your happiness is moot, unknown, inapplicable, a word and emotion that has no meaning for you except as an intellectual concept. You must do nothing, but you must do. You derive no happiness. You burn and take steps in a foreign body under a great weight and sense experiences beyond yourself, in others, and try to wrap your awareness around it all. You have blood on your face, and the act of smearing that blood made you feel alive. Must you kill to attain that feeling. Is that feeling worth attaining. You do not know if you recognize yourself. You did not reflect in the river. Your face in that warm rabbit is the only time since you came here, reawoken, risen from the ground, expanded from the seed of infinite density temperature curvature, dripped up, that you felt whole, yourself, at home. Perhaps you should unwind the grey cloth from some lost soul and take a print of your bloody face. Perhaps you would see yourself in negative in the shroud, your high points red and your cavities light. Perhaps you must kill to be alive.

He: Why the tattoo?
She: You just now noticing it?
He: I'm just now saying it.
She: Been shirtsleeves weather for awhile.
He: It's an eye.
She: Aye.
She ties off the manty rope, throws a half-hitch around the loop, and stands the pack on end. Crisp corners, half-hitches evenly spaced, right angle ropes, parallel across the box. Like a wrapped present. A dusty manty of money. He finishes wrapping his pack of half their present. A match to the other. She displays her left forearm. 
She: It's not a permanent tattoo. It's ink. From a pen.
He: You must not sweat much.
She: It smears, runs, drips. I wash it clean and re-ink it every morning. Need all the eyes I can get. 
He: From there, about all it can keep an eye on is your other arm.
She: Easy inscribing, on the forearm.
He: Suppose it could've helped count the money last night.
She: It doesn't do addition. It sees.
They fold the manties over their food boxes, bottom corner, left corner, right fold and over, top over and fold.
She: The location doesn't matter. It's an elk eye.
He: How can you tell?
She: Don't have to tell. I know. I draw it every morning.
He: Connects you to the animal world or the eternal present or some shit, I suppose.
She: You suppose. There is another world, but it is in this one.
He leads the white mule over and ties him to a tree. He on the on side tightens his cinch and lets down the sling rope. She on the off side lets down the sling rope. They load the food packs. Basket hitch, tight to the D's. He leads him away. She leads a black mule over. She on the on side tightens her cinch and lets down the sling rope. He on the off side lets down the sling rope. They sling a pack of gear, you presume, basket hitch, tight to the D's, slack sling rope stowed running a bite under the manty rope at the top of the pack, tag end on the right for easy pulling to drop the pack in an emergency. She leads her away, leads over the black mule with the boots, ties him to the tree. Boots or socks, Socks or Rooster. She loosens his cinch, scoots up the pad under the saddle, and tightens his cinch. She lets down a sling rope, he lets down a sling rope. She lifts a pack of money to her knees, then hoists it onto the back of the mule and begins to tie it down. He lifts the other pack onto the off side and tucks the top under hers so they touch. They tie off and stow the ropes. She steps behind the mule, checks the packs, nods. She steps forward, retightens the cinch. They are in a place of high blue mountains to the west, yellow grasses, cottonwoods lining a small river. They both lift their hats and wipe the sweat from their brow. The sun peaks over the hills to the east.
She: We should leave the money here.
He: We should leave the money here.
She: Yeah. Bury it.
He: This is an ambiguous bank robbery and slow as possible getaway, correct?
She: Sorta.
He: What would we do?
She: Bury it. Then keep on.
He: Without the money.
She: Yeah.
He: Why?
She: What would be the difference? Can't use it in this country for fear of being identified. So it's no good in the frontcountry, and we can't use it in the backcountry because money has no currency here.
He: We aren't exactly living off the land. We need to buy food.
She: $100 every 2 weeks or more for a resupply doesn't exactly necessitate a mule load of money chained to us like Jacob Marley. The money's just another thing, a whole quantity of things. Get up and load and ride 20 miles in the wilderness and unload and watch the sunset and stars alight and go to bed. This life don't cost. 
He: The money is why we're here. The freedom --
She: Neither you nor I are here for the money. You do not believe money is freedom.
(Pause)
He: You're right, as a possession, a thing, an acquisition, I couldn't give a shit about the money. It's the act, the life. The having taken our selves back. Without it, without having stolen it, we're just two fools riding around in the woods, with no purpose but … recreation, relaxation, pleasure. It's empty.
She straps a nosebag on the boots mule's saddle's front D. A water bottle, snacks, a first aid kit, gloves, wads of hay twine, a leather punch in the nosebag. E-Z boot. They both tie saddlebags on the back of their saddles, water bottle, snacks, headlamp. Carhartt or Philsin or bedraggled wool coat rolled and tied atop the saddlebags with the leather strings for her. Knife on the belt. He slides a dirty faded red sweatshirt alongside a pack under the ropes, as they both do with a short curved saw, sheathed. His pocketknife is clipped in his pocket and his gun is where it lives in the small of his back. They each clip a double-bit ax to the front ring of their lead mule's D, the black with socks and the white, so the handle hangs under the on-side pack.
She: What's empty is doing it fake. We can say fuck you and ride off and lead our lives.
He: Without the money it doesn't mean nothing to them.
She: Fuck them. They're zombies.
He: It ain't that easy. You can go off and be a hermit, leave society behind, be an ascetic, some sort of solitudinous outlaw, but then it's all for you. Solipsism. A criminal not a rebel. Nobody knows, nobody cares, and when you die it's gone. It isn't just that nobody cares so nobody remembers you so you leave no trace of memory, but what you do, the statement your life makes about what is of value and what is not does not get made, because you communicate it to nobody. You affect nothing and no one. Your life has no human meaning without relationship to others. You leave no trace.
She: You don't sound like much of an outlaw.
He: What they said was real, makes me want to steal --
She: And that's a lot of words while you're supposedly mounting up to hit the trail. Sun's on the move.
He: Take time with a wounded hand, because it likes heal --
She: I want to live. The eye wants to live.
He: Yes I like to steal --
They tie the mules together, lead rope to pigtail, he the white mule and empty sorrel saddle horse, she Rooster and the two black mules, the short fat one in back now on a twine pigtail because he hauls back so often they can't spare the rope for five goddamn pigtails a day.
She: There's a pretense here --
He: A posttense --
She: An other than present tense. And I don't care for living under a pretense. I strive to live true.
He: Which is why you're in the middle of nowhere --
She: In the mountains. Idaho or Wyoming or Colorado don't matter.
He: With me in the wilderness with a mule load of money.
She: Trying to shuck the money.
He: It's what they value. Money and attention. Take it and give 'em something to think about.
She: Talk about. It's a drop in the bucket. Irrelevant. You have any recollection of how much there is? A number?
He: No. A mule load. Approximately 160 lbs.
She: We just counted it last night.
He: The value of a man risking his life knocking up an armored car or whatever happened -- Don't say. I don't want to know.
She: That's what I'm saying. Our lives, and his life, are the value of what that mule carries.
They bridle their horses. The paint rubs his head on her. He scratches behind the ears of the black horse, under the chin, makes some uh-huh noises. He unties his mule and with the lead rope in his right hand and reins in his left, left foot in the stirrup and left hand to mane, mounts and pulls back so his horse doesn't step out. She mounts and her horse walks over to the tree Boots is tied to and she reaches down and pulls the tag end of the lead rope and she and her three mules do a circle to line out.
He: Practically speaking, the money is more likely to be found here than with us. We aren't the first or last people to camp here.
She: What they think is real is not real.
He: I know. It makes me want to steal.
She: You go first, so Moses isn't kicking at you all day.
They ride down the trail. She tucks the paint in behind the empty saddle horse, a string of twelve hooves ahead, four underneath, twelve hooves behind. A many-legged insect. The dust kicks up. She and he pull bandanas over their faces. They float down the trail in the dust cloud atop the legged worm.

Did someone kill you to make you alive. The structure of that thought implies intention. Did someone kill you, which inadvertently brought you to life. Someone or something. And you are not who that you was, whoever you were, so should you not say, Did someone or something kill him or her, bringing you into life. Something, like a rabbit, a bird, a rat, a virus. A river. A radiative glow of technology. Someone, like two men guns slung low on hips in the sun sweating the butt of a cigar in a mouth perhaps one with a metal plate over his chest under his poncho the other drawing shooting, like an old man you remember or imagine with a gun a sidearm a revolver he never shot robbing banks with the utmost courtesy to the tellers, no life is not on the big screen or in the little screen, like someone a guardian or friend or yourself who left you to who led you to your own devices your own infernal, not infernal, negligent escapist consumptive devices who allowed you to be taken by the plague. He she you. Rabbit virus river. Was he she you infected. And why. What for. How come. Perhaps the infection is a separate process from the death. Perhaps you were killed by a bullet, or you died a natural death by river or rock or mountain, and then you were infected by rat or rabid rabbit when it took a bite of you, or by the maggots of the flies that laid their eggs in you, or by the bacteria who had previously coexisted with you in your gut but began to digest you he she when anaerobic processes came to dominate inside she you he when respiration ceased. You do not know if the What for has an answer. Perhaps the How. There must be a process to explain, to explain why you are the way you are, how you came to be. But that is not exactly why you are asking the questions, your line of inquiry. Perhaps the process will be explained by you, elucidated in greater depth, and through the process the reason will come to light, the purpose, but that is what you are getting at, after, to: what is your purpose. Moreso, what are you to do. You he she were killed by a man or woman, by a rock or river, by a rabbit or virus, by yourself or by a negligent zombie, perhaps the mechanism is irrelevant to this question, for what obligation do you yet have to that he or she who previously inhabited this body and who you were. In other words, or tangentially, should you seek retribution. Should you kill who or what killed you. Where are you. Walking. You set out walking to see yourself in their faces. But you know what you will see in their faces when they see you. You saw it in the face of the bear. Fear. Did you too host the fear in your face before you died. Did you bear the bear's face, barren, laid bare, boring or boring in, overbearing. Are you joking. You do not know. Yes and no. It is certainly not funny. The question walking gives no answers but processes and the evolution of life and mind and consciousness and there is no God, fine, and this is not a de Sade castle prison in the sky, what does that mean, others thought creep. You walk then, you tell yourself, not like the deer or bear or the human does, to survive sufficiently, to procreate, to acquire or achieve necessities and pleasures, to get from here to there, but to understand, to comprehend self and surroundings and this telemetric communication and teleology, nobody knows what such a word means, and yes thereby to perhaps procreate in a new way, which is an old way, the dissemination of thought, the spread of consciousness. And thus, you expand your consciousness into a rabbit. You procreate with a bunny. You ate out a bunny and begat a new higher awareness bunny. Is that what you are saying. If that does not smack of reverse engineering, of justification postfact, then perhaps you are nothing but the mindless walking dead. That is not what you are saying, stop putting words in your mouth like hares for a gory laugh grotesque amusement repulsive entertainment. You are not in the bunny brain, you have not gained rabbit consciousness, you have not performed cunnilingus on a hare, you are not now simultaneously questioning the purpose of your existence and your relationship with a bunny and bounding across a meadow of wildflowers where bees buzz and a coyote lurks, you do not know what it is like to fuck like a rabbit, fast and often, the bunny is not in you, you are not a zombie rabbit, consuming the hare did not expand your awareness. Except in that you learned something of yourself. So you did not procreate a new you in the bunny, though you did make a new different conception of rabbit in your mind you think, but you did procreate a new you via an enhanced understanding of the new undead you. And so nevertheless the rabbit does not negate the observation that there is as far as you can discern a twofold possibility: by killing human beings you would procreate new undead beings that in some respects are like yourself in that they could be capable of attaining a higher awareness of space and time and the value of life and the worthlessness of certain endeavors while acknowledging the point of view that such awareness is both paralyzing and liberating; and by killing human beings you would procreate as in expand your own awareness of self and universe. Because your self would grow via the acquiring of more selves. Threefold: there is the possibility that the new undead you procreate would meld or in some way form a collective with your consciousness when they undie, which is like a fusion of your initial twofold possibilities and is a particularly promising possibility highlighted by your undead access to an expanded present and other humans' past experiences and other undeads' current experiences and all of their possibilities, all of your possibilities, in which you would not be solely you but all of you. Taking a step back from such a grandiosity as universal consciousness, you suspect you have the most access to and are most drawn to those who were closest to he she you. Who killed he she you would likely be included in that circle, if they yet live. You seem to be suggesting that you should, in fact, hunt them and kill them, and thereby procreate. You have not presented an argument that you should not do so. And in reality you are not sure what your alternatives are. You could sit and do nothing. Although doing nothing is extremely difficult and still qualifies as doing something. You could rebury yourself you suppose. Which sounds like a redefinition of hell, which you do not believe in. The burn within and the weight without and you incessantly in every moment choosing to do nothing. Or you could roam alone, walk alone, avoiding the living, or at least avoiding humanity, but for how long can you accomplish that? So far you have yet to encounter a real human except in your mind, so perhaps you could avoid them for a long time, maybe there are not that many real humans left, but good god you do not know you might live forever now that you are dead, and by the law of probability you are bound to run into one eventually and infect them, if you are infectious, unless they are all dead already, which seems possible. You have no tangible evidence of their existence in this present world you walk in and are bound to, only visions of elk eyes and rabbit blood, traces of remembrances, some of which cannot be yours, or were not. Unless they are all undead, which seems like something they would be capable of doing to themselves, though you imagine you would be aware of them if that were the case. Unless you have awoken in a new world, your own personal undead world, alone, bound, free within these confines, this world your oyster. But you can think of no other way to discover if humanity is here except to keep walking. You can wait to decide whether or not to kill them until you find them, see their faces, see your face in their faces, how they make you feel, you feel almost nothing, about the possibility of seeding sporing spawning a new undead humanity, expanding a new special awareness, a new species awareness, of turning your self into an implement for sculpting a new being incorporating other minds and other worlds from this mundane monotonous inexpressive chaotic disorder-seeking material, of turning your liberated attention to the "slowly cumulative strokes of choice" to extrude a new, aware, perhaps multi-dimensional being that can simultaneously inhabit a Calibi-Yau space singing as a vibrating string and commune sympathetically with the stars and justify conscious existence.

He walks down the white lit hall, black cowboy boots and black hat. Black vest over dark gray western-cut shirt, Wranglers, a black bandana around his neck, you come up with these ornaments to ensure there is not nothing between boots and hat. The boots and hat are the sole certainties, the quali of he who walks down the hall. The rest is a cloud of relation. He nods at a receptionist, at nurses at the nurse station, at care staff. The remainder your mind imagines to clothe the possible. There is the thud of boots down the long white hall, steady, a metronome. The occasional nodding of the hat to figures foggily seen, figures inferred, figures without faces. At the end of the hall, which is distant yet, approaches a figure uninferred, a tiny figure sitting in a chair, growing larger. The chair has wheels, but the figure does not use them. The figure is motionless, you are the one who approaches, you and the empty man between thudding black boots and nodding black hat. The figure has a face, white hair above it, wrinkles, a thin skin, almost translucent, the bloodwork underneath, veins visible blue, a skin like paper, coming nearer, you nearer, growing larger, staring into nothing. The boots thud, but she does not seem to hear. This old woman in the chair, the wheelchair, does not seem to hear and she does not seem to see. She stares out into nothing, through you, through him, face slack, waiting for what, as the boots thud and the hat nears, growing louder and larger, waiting for what. Can she not see, can she not hear, and in that case what could she wait for, what could come, another, a figure she cannot see or hear? Does she think while she waits. Does she know what she waits for. Does she think or remember memories while she sits all day long day after day at the end of the long white hall waiting for she knows not what, no, your inference put into her head. He does not know, you do not know if the waiting is with content, or empty, if she is more than paper skin clothing an empty waiting now or a vessel containing a lifetime of content. Waiting. Not of contentment, you do not know that, but perhaps of content. He knows one thing she says within the skin day after day, he has heard it, I don't know how I came to this, each time he finds her here. But as for the rest, the hours day-by-day sitting in this hall waiting staring into nothing hearing indistinct murmurings at the periphery of awareness, he does not know whether or not there are thoughts that can be called thoughts, if she has them, or internal conversations, or life twisted by memory replayed repeatedly as if on a screen, or daydreaming, or nothing. She says she sits in the hall so she won't sleep, won't fall asleep during the day, waiting. If she watches the television in her room no matter the volume she falls asleep, and then she can't sleep at night, and awake alone in the dark in the bed is worse than awake alone in the light in the hall. Therefore, the hall and waiting. She has spent a lifetime under the paper skin, a tree sprouting from her, four children, ten grandchildren, twenty-some-odd great grandchildren, a tree growing branching budding. Has all her life gone to that, to tree, to seed, waiting in the hall. Are you and others of you what is left of her. Is she naught but paper skin now, or do you do her a disservice, a dehumanization by conjecturing into her. You know not what is in her head, if at this late hour she considers or can conceive the questions what for, and for what. You are upon her. He is upon her, and her attention comes into focus from the nowhere and she recognizes him and opens herself and says, Oh, look who it is, and he, the black boots and black hat and what in between, bends and embraces her, and he says, Hello Grandma, Happy Birthday, and she says, It's our birthday, and he says, Yes, ours. Wrapped in this embrace, he cannot escape another room at the end of a different hall twenty years ago, he a young man but standing as now, black boots and black hat and clothed by you in between, not just clothed but fleshed, given body, on the bed his grandfather, a sack of bricks with all the bricks spilled out, leaked out, tubes in his arms, gone, gasping breath, not here, already exited his open mouth, fluid gurgling in his lungs, not a human but a deflated balloon of morphine, all his gentleness spent, all his angerlessness hacked out, all his loving attention paid, nothing now but a morphine drip and a taught seal of a mouth opened as a jar contents spilled, his patents, his descendants, his pumpkins, his professional successes, his american industry, his engineering, his peace spilled, seal broken, evaporating, something called life yet in him, some biological process, but for what, by what process does he live on as a shadow in the man in black boots and black hat, to what ends, what is worth doing if he is to end like this, evacuated on a drip, waiting for the end, in a hall without exit. Perhaps he can choose how he dies. Perhaps he cannot. Perhaps he can choose how he lives. He hugs his grandmother, it's her birthday. His grandfather's lips are a taught ashen O. He falls silent as the inside of a still snowglobe. She pats his hand, looks into him with watery eyes. He shakes, lurches. A gasp escapes, which becomes a choked gurgle. Then, again, silence.

Footsteps at your feet in the snow. They go the way you go. As if to say the world does not stop to aid you putting off a choice you are not prepared to make. As if you called them to you by walking toward them, by consciously evaluating your potential actions and forecasting the possibilities, by imagining when you might encounter the footsteps' creators. As if you made them. Footprints, not footsteps. Your feet are bare you see as you look down at the snow. Footwear has not been a predicament to perseverate about since you have been undead. Your feet are not cold, you cannot feel your feet, your feet feel nothing and feel like nothing. The footprints are bootprints and hoofprints. Perhaps once upon a time you wore boots and/or your feet were hooves. The prints are occasionally distinguishable individually, but overwhelmingly they are churned together as if made by one creature with many feet. Or, based on the extent of the churn running through the old snow in and out of sidehill bowls like a creek channel cut into the hillside, like an irrigation channel cut from a creek churning through a snow-softened, snow-quieted, snow-purified landscape, possibly they were made by the feet of many many-footed creatures of the same kind. You can imagine the sound, the dull roar it made, or they made, breaking through the crust streaked with red mildew and crunching the snow underneath. Whatever reasons you come up with for why the creature(s) was (were) or is (are) on a trail that is yet snowbound in mid-summer, based on the intensity and height and angle of observation of the sun above and on the heat and dust and yellow grasses and flowers gone to seed that you perceive in the valley below, seem implausible. Possible reasons you consider: leisure, adventure for modern men who live lives without risk, recreation, expanded awareness through expanded experience, solitude, self-inflicted trials in a process of self-discovery, a movement from point A across the divide to point B along the shortest path in local spacetime, safety, the meeting of basic needs such as with nomads and migrating animals, the seeking of intentional discomfort for one who lives a decadent life, if the creature feels bodily sensations, unlike you. None of these explanations seem complete. Nevertheless, you perceive. Nevertheless, you are the interface between the making of automatic perceptual representations that have meaning in their infinite implications and possibilities for action, and action. The zombie perceives, the zombie in you carries out the act. You are the entity between the zombie and the zombie in you. You are the one who mediates the meaning and assesses the implications and evaluates the possibilities, and in the end makes a choice, again and again and again, incessantly, no matter if the choice is a choice or not a choice. You shuffle through the churn of snow. The snow blends with the sky. You follow the trail automatically. A trail churned, soft, simple, broken, sloppy, melting. Surroundings encapsulated in a crust, a shell, like candy, like this planet's mantle, like plastic. Churned through a plastic surface like yours. You feel nothing. Your feet are not freezing, not cold, not numb. Sloppy summer snow you can already see the end of. The tracks trail churn meld with mud soon before long in the near distance and so even now. It is not that you feel nothing. A zombie would not know of its stench, of its own rotting flesh. You cannot smell yourself but nevertheless you are aware of your stench rot. You slog through mud. Perhaps you are aware of it because you imagine a perspective outside your body looking upon yourself. Perhaps imagining is too figurative a word. Image-making, however, might not be too distant. A snowfield, with limits, you traverse, streaking it with mud, a north-facing aspect protected from the sun, hanging on by the skin of its teeth while the world gets hotter, a small glacier perhaps even, lessening. You imagine visualize see yourself trudging across a lessening glacier following a creature's churn leaving mud tracks outside your body. This body, a case of endosymbiosis perhaps, perhaps as the mitochondria symbiotically melded into prokaryotic cells forming the eukaryotes you interface into this corpse corpus device. Perhaps in so doing, in incorporating a body other to you, outside of you, you bridge the third person and first person points of view of existence. You experience the experiences of others, which then become your own. In which case are you not he and she and they and I and we. Perhaps then you are the link between mind and body, a solution to the unwordable problem, the interface between outside and in, the membrane between yin and yang. Perhaps you are the ultimate device. Perhaps you are grandiose with delusions of omnipotence. You almost feel nothing but you are not devoid of feeling, of perception, of emotion. Perhaps your sensation is subdued or subjected or subsumed by all you have to take in, to process, with all this his her awareness, this experiencing of others' experiences as well as your own, the weight, the feeling and feelings of others is and are overwhelming, the burning, you conjecture. But even though you feel as close to nothing as seems possible, in one way, not to mention the opposite in another way, you do assign qualia, footprint, hoofprint, boot track, qualitative meaning, candy, mantle, plastic, it is the only way to distinguish things, bear, hummingbird, horse, the only way anything has a value, elk, eye, calf, the only way to make a choice to convert into action, loosely sloppily churned termed, a value sloppily termed your feelings about a thing. Making those choices has not been easy, not automatic, somewhat paralyzing you admit, but having chosen somewhere, at a point you have difficulty identifying, to follow the creature's tracks, you feel good, sloppy, purposeful, this again, alive, as you step out of the snowfield, belaboring, out of the snow again, and turn a corner on an overexposed point, a sense of meaningfulness, you cannot bear yourself, and the sun hits you in your slack face with what you cannot call warmth.
(15)
He screams and pierces the silence. He is screaming wordlessly rending the blackness. His screams form words to shape the night, Get off me, ahh, what the. A struggle in the dark, thumping from the dark, a light stabbing the dark, and then a gunshot unexpected nearathand explosion. In the rent silence without her and the unknown dreams within, her brain shuts down for a moment to escape sensation, except for the feeling of being lifted, of levitating a few inches off the ground in her bag inside the sound of a bell tolling. She is blind, no, she can't see, all light. The light shining from his forehead is in her eyes. He is in the tent heaving breath, hat and boots and gun in hand. She can't see his face for the light. He drops the boots and hat and crawls out, all blackness again, the sound of running feet, the sound of the river, and he returns white light with his bedroll and top shirt and coat he uses as a pillow under his arm and he crawls into the tent and squeezes in beside her, on top of her, no space, all light, a large gun in a small tent, a flimsy piece of plastic fabric keeping the outside from intruding in. He turns his face heaving breath from her to zip the tent door and she can see his face in profile and in it she reads fear.
She: Get off me. 
He: Did you see it?
She: Can't see anything with your goddamn light in my face.
He: It -- It had my foot in its, inside its mouth.
She: What are you talking about.
He: I think it's gone. I. I scared it off.
She: You were dreaming.
He: This is not a dream. It smells.
He sets the gun between him and the front door and fumbles with his sleeping bag and finds the foot and shoves it in her face. She gags. There is a round wet spot there smelling of, she has no other word for it, death. She shoves it away. 
He: My foot was in its mouth.
She: My god. It's still out there.
(Silence)
He: We'll just stay in here. We're safe in here.
She: I could poke a hole in this tent with my finger.
He: I have my gun.
She: Yeah. What did you hit out there, the sky?
He: It's dark. Out there, it's dark out there. It blended.
(Silence)
She: And your foot?
He: My foot?
She: Is it still attached?
He: Yes.
She: And?
He: It didn't bite down. It only mouthed it.
She: Mouthed. Like investigating you with its mouth.
He: Like a dog. An enormous dog. Like a bear.
She: Well. If the like-a-bear didn't take your foot, I guess I don't have to leave you for dead.
He rustles, situating himself and his bedroll and his objects. She hears nothing outside in the dark, nothing but river. All the noise is inside in his fluttering light. He is too close. All the noise that must be in his head now. She lies downs and turns her back to him and pulls the lip of her bag over her face to block the light, to stifle the stench, to muffle the noise, the bag a physical barrier between her and him, another fabric between her and it, another sheet of plastic between inside her and outside her. Inside the lip of the bag she smells herself, months in the mountains, inside the mouth pulled tight. She is in the dark panting in a sparse wood, trees tall, branches high above, trunks the width of a person's outstretched arms, land flat, a river coursing, the trees in silhouette in all directions, backlit by a dimly glowing twilit purple sky. She stands. She is trying to go somewhere, she doesn't know where, nowhere, every direction the same except the river. She takes a step downstream, there is a heavy weight on her back, a backpack digging into her shoulders, her hips. Another step downstream, towards where she will have nowhere to go, where she can lay her burden down and put her mind to rest, and all the trees around her take a step to the right clockwise, not the trees, the men who were standing behind the trees, not men but humans, not human but dead surrounding her. In unison they take a step toward her, the stench, a step toward her, encircling her, converging and she spins nowhere to go. One of them has no arms and one walks out of the river dragging a broken dripping leg and one as she looks it in the eye its face slides off and one rides a dead horse and one's head is caved in as if by a rock or hammer or hoof and one has an eye in its chest and they step toward her converging. She needs to go downstream and has nowhere to go and she can't drop the weight and they step and they are almost on her and one reaches out and places a hand on her hip it burns and she elbows it in the abdomen and rakes her fingernails across another's facelessness ripping away more of what's not there and pushes another down with unexpected ease and runs through the gap it creates. She runs, trees receding behind her, new trees approaching before, without change in her surroundings. They pursue walking, not receding, not more distant, but inexplicably approaching despite their slow motion. She runs into the river so they lose her scent she's seen it in movies and she stumbles on the rocks and falls on all fours in the water, the weight on her back holding her down, her head goes under and the river pushes her turning her head downstream, pushing against her, pushing against the back of her thighs, the water pushing around her thighs spreading, the water enters her, the river pushes all the way in, coursing, pushing all the way up through her, to the end of the inside of her, she pushing back, the river pushing through swelling pushing through the end of her, the river coming out of her mouth, the river flowing through her into and through and out of her, and she returns to liquid and becomes the river and flows away. She comes to and it is light out. She is naked in her bag, not in it but under it. He and all the things that are his, him, are outside of the tent. She gets dressed and goes out. He is cooking bacon and eggs on the propane campstove in a cast iron skillet. The smell is everywhere. She cannot read his face. There is a small fire which she knows he makes out of habit when he rises at dawn, out of routines, not out of necessity this time of year, when the early morning is the only respite from the heat of the day. Good morning, he says like any other morning, Coffee is up. He points to the percolator on a rock near the edge of the fire. Small black bear coming and going, he says, on the edge of camp. She looks around to the edge of the small bench next to the river on which they are camped, where there is a rise to a larger bench and a picked-over meadow for the stock to graze. The horses are still highlined, the mules are loose nearby but looking intently into the trees, ears all pointed in one direction. Thought I'd cook up a hot breakfast this morning, to torture him, he says. And because I'm hungrier than normal, on account of being up half the night. She walks away and squats behind a bit of brush out of view of him and the river and pees. What is real. Dreams are real when you are in them, even when you are only in your head. What's in your head plays a role in creating reality. Everything feels unreal. The coursing of the river. The ladder of smoke. The smell of bacon. She pours herself a mug of coffee. He puts two eggs and three pieces of bacon and two pieces of bread each on two metal plates. Sign this morning of it poking around the food boxes. My foot must not have satisfied. Didn't get nothing though, all latched up. Don't shoot it, she says, finds herself saying, then to cover, It'll make a mess, involving Fish and Game, Law Enforcement, … a drama. He smiles, meaning what. It could expose us, she says, and regrets having spoken. I got no desire to shoot it, he says, just a little bear. I only shoot at the sky. He hands her the plate of food. She sits on a round some past camper has cut, how many have sat here, in the middle of nowhere on a bench near where another creek feeds the river. What is he thinking. She is not hungry. Her gut is a cavity. What does she look like in his eyes? She hasn't seen herself in weeks. She pokes at an egg, watches the yolk run. What is real. Bacon and eggs, bear, river. Mules, money, mountains. Zombies, backpack, him. What came in the night. She cannot let him be real. The zombies were only a dream. The river rushes in its bed and her ears. Well let's eat up, she says, and get going, see if we can't leave this bear behind.

At the border of the river among the rocks sits the frying pan, shaping the shallow water sheened in oil within it. Or, which it contains. Your sentence makes you self-conscious. The association of words. Nevertheless there is the pan. Cast iron. Cold, like the dead fire in the camp on the small flat between the coursing river and the broader bench. On the bank, perhaps. Soaking maybe, to be scrubbed. Then left, forgotten, you deduce. With your higher awareness. How handy. Rust has not oxidized the pan yet. It has been at rest alongside the coursing river long enough to get cold and short enough to not rust. Somewhere between several minutes and several days. What a goddamn zombie. Cast iron heats slowly but holds its heat long, even, steady. You did not know you knew so much about cast iron. It is heavy. It is a popular camp at a ford of the river, off a main trail with an abundance of stock traffic, connecting to, based on the jumble of tracks, another main trail on the other side of the river. You imagine. Putting that higher awareness to work. You followed the tracks of the creature you were following down a side drainage and lost them in the ankle deep dust of the main trail and turned down the connector to the ford because … of an impulse, or intuition, or perhaps muscle memory, or an unconscious perception. The zombie inside of you's choice. Zombies do not make choices. The zombie inside the zombie inside of you. Or the you inside the zombie. The zombie going to work with a thermos of coffee, checking social media, buying water from mountain streams in plastic bottles, watching shows, going through the motions, whatever zombies do. Working tirelessly forward incessantly without purpose. Not without purpose, a singular oversimplified purpose, without thought. The zombie is nothing but a metaphor, you propose, because you do not like the connotations of being a zombie. Except you are not a metaphor, you are real. Zombies are not self-conscious. Yet here you are, trying to decide what to do, what is best to do, how to do it, why, like at every other godforsaken moment. You are an impossibility, dead alive, an aware zombie. Fine. It is a popular camp. For hundreds of years, or more, perhaps. For as long as that Ponderosa pine has been here. The creature you follow was here. Those whom you follow were here, in near-at-hand time. You cannot smell but your brain creates a perception that they were here from the quality of the air that you for-lack-of-a-better-word call smell even if it is a different sensation. You can smell they were here, like a bloodhound. Where and when did they go. You look in the pan. You are there in the pan looking back at you. But it is not you. Why do you reflect now in the frying pan when you did not in the river after you fell up. Have you changed, become more substantial, grown. Or is your reflection a projection of your mind, of your supposed higher awareness, of you. Who are you. You have an impossible self. Under a slack slipping face. You must have a self, you cannot allow yourself to be simply their zombie, a vessel for their consumption, a stench for their Listerine, a higher attention to be manipulated, an automaton performing with economic intent. You must be making choices, choosing to follow them, having thoughts of your own, not theirs and not the zombie's. You will yourself to have a will, or you could not live with yourself. But are the others and the zombie what constitute you. The qualities of a self. Embodied: yes, you are here in a body even if it is not yours and it seems as though you are at times in other bodies. There you are after all looking back at you from the bottom of a frying pan. Emotional: a harder sell, but yes you claim to have them, now that you have drawn a distinction between feeling nothing and having emotions. Indeed you now assert that you attach great emotional significance to feeling nothing. You feel both hyperconnected, on account of the kindling and being undead you suppose, and emotionally remote, on account of the burning and being dead you imagine. Sometimes you think you can smell yourself rot. But objects and ideas and happenings have meanings for you, distinctions, and that is a result of your emotional subtlety. The air sizzles as if with the heat the smoke of an enormous meadow-sized frying pan, prairie-sized, plains-sized, or else thousands, millions of personal cast iron frying pans cooking breakfast, scenting the air with bacon. Yes, sometimes you are emotionally subtle. You are attuned, adept at perceiving quantum fluctuations in the emotional signature that another cannot, part of your higher consciousness, you make yourself laugh, zombies cannot laugh, that is why you must make yourself, or self-degrade. Bacon and eggs. Your ego is awful healthy for: a) being so many people at once, b) being dead, c) being unsure where you stand in regards to the conscious and the unconscious. Meaning is derived from emotion, someone once said. You are unsure what they mean, but it is all semantics. Executive: Well that is what you are debating with yourself now is it not -- do you have free will. Certainly you have in you a representation of the world, and a representation of yourself, and a representation of yourself in the world, and a representation of you representing yourself in the world, and a representation of how the world represents you, and a representation of how the world represents you representing it. And on down. Some of these representations are in the developmental stage. You are attempting to become a "conditional readiness to act" in "the universal field of infinite possibilities." You are in charge of yourself are you not. Mnemonic: memories yes you have them past and future and present memory, even if sometimes you do not know which memories are yours or if you inhabit the memories of others or if they are all collectively yours. Or you theirs. Unified self: There is another rub. See all the preceding. From whence is this list. Did the you in the frying pan find the list of the qualities of selfhood on the other side of your reflection. You are pretty certain there is no homunculus in you, despite your flirtations with the zombie within and without you, not to mention all these different selves within and without you which you are attempting to assimilate thanks to the higher awareness thing. You cannot deny that from some points of view you are a zombie and that you are the incorporation of many other yous, but you would like to believe you are giving unity your best effort. Vigilant: Although you find it difficult to do anything, you are compelled to do something, the burn, the weight that will crush you if you do not move, and you are not dead yet, or again, so you will continue to do, if this counts as doing, and if that is vigilance you have it. Conceptual self: See all the preceding again. Also, how is a frying pan like a book. Social self: Well you are perhaps inhabiting whether by empathy or kindling or collective consciousness others who are not you, or are partially you, which could be described as social, and you indicated a concern for the future of the human species or perhaps a new undead species to descend from you and humanity, and both the concern and the act of procreation qualifies as social, and your thoughts are an open book, which is akin to achieving the social via the asocial. So you guess you have decided you have a self, despite being dead, examining you in the frying pan sheened in a prism of oil, but for some reason the process has pissed you off, made you angry, perhaps due to the method of examination, the process of the decision making, a mirror in a frying pan like a fucking book, you are feeling some emotion now, anger as the window to the soul, a soul!, animal soul, without even being able to describe your mishappen degraded appearance, or why you are here and why you have not been released and you want to shutdown sleep cease blackout nothingness and do you have a choice and the weight and burn and you throw the fucking frying pan and the you in the frying pan as far into the river as you can, which is farther than you thought possible, almost all the way across, or all the way across, or all the way across and it falls back into the river due to the classical physics of colliding bodies when it rebounds off a rock or due to backspin or due to gravity when it hits the opposite bank, it sinks into the river, falls up in the river, no it falls the fuck down, and then you walk downstream along a smaller unmaintained trail, because you choose to, because they are there, whoever they are, are they you, wherever there is, is there a there a there.
(16)
She: Is it still coming?
His horse stumbles on the question mark. He raises his hand to his ear to indicate he cannot hear her here, at the end of the worm. She twists further around in her saddle to shout over the string snaking between them.
She: Is he still coming!
He: It's complicated. To begin:
A) How do you know it's a he?
B) You should say, Is it still goddamn there?, because what you said, Is he still coming?, from my point of view, implies that you want it to keep coming.
C) Yes, with a lumbering montonony of incessantness, it is always there, tailing us.
She: What!
He: Yes.
He does not shout, but he gives her a thumbs up because nonverbal communication is the most important variety of communication and she turns forward in the saddle and stops watching him and sorta relaxes. She is pulling her three black mules and that sorrel horse he doesn't ask about and his Ghost mule, and he is pulling nothing. He is pulling a bear, back there somewhere, by a very long, invisible, attenuated lead rope. He had her take Ghost too because Ghost was spooked knowing the bear was behind him, out of sight. Ghost is still spooked with he and Crow and the bear behind him because he is used to being the end of the string, the butt of the worm, nothing behind him, and because Crow sometimes tries to bite his ass. But at least now there's nothing between him and the bear. What's a black bear a third the size of his horse gonna do to three horses, four mules, and two people, worming along? Nothing. He might outweigh the bear himself. Maybe it liked the taste of his foot. Bears don't follow strings like dogs. Piss deer do sometimes. Maybe this bear is part piss deer.
Suddenly she stops, one can stop suddenly at three miles an hour, he thinks with you, and the string bunches up, the worm contracting, Ghost about passing the sorrel horse but the sorrel turns and snaps at him and then lets fly a kick and Ghost jumps off the trail up the sidehill, now standing directly above him as Crow crowds forward. An uncomfortable spot to stop. On a sidehill, in a finger of an old burn reaching down to a river. Hasn't been a day for days they haven't spent several miles in a firescar, not wanting to stop, waiting for some old snag to fall before them or behind them or in them. They are at a trail junction, he sees, a wadded up string, a tied up worm, at a confluence of rivers, one trail keeping on this side and turning up the tributary, the way for them to stay in the mountains along the route they'd planned, the other peeling off and switch backing down the hill to follow the larger branch of the river, which bends away.
He cannot see the sky for the haze. Ghost swings his backside around 180 degrees so now he's facing backwards, uphill of the sorrel, perhaps to look at him and Crow, perhaps because he doesn't like standing where he's standing, where he's put himself, on a crappy loose sidehill off the trail with poor footing in an old burn where he might punch through burned roots, perhaps because Ghost doesn't like breathing smoke, he is a sensitive mule. He doesn't know, can't be inside the mule's head, but he knows what happens next, he's been here many times in other predicaments that were the same but different. The sorrel bites Ghost's ass and Ghost lets fly a kick, a good one, he's a proud mule, which lands on the horse's neck, and the sorrel turns sideways in the trail to kick back with the rear left, sending Ghost scrambling further up the hill but in the process the sorrel plants his forehooves on the soft berm, which gives out, and his front legs plunge off the trail, down hill, his shoulders and head with them. His lead rope tied to Old Moses's pigtail pulls the Old Moses mule's back half off the trail down hill, whereupon the sorrel thrashes in the loose old ashy duff, trying to get back up to the solid trail while the ash dirt duff gives way under him. Like sand in an hourglass. The thrashing seems to last forever, and in that time he is outside of himself watching the situation unfold as a spectator, powerless, time enough to think of a strained metaphor, time enough to know the thrashing can only last a few seconds and in that time it will be determined if the whole worm will be pulled down the hill with the sorrel horse and roll into the river mostly dead, or if he can regain his footing on the trail. Ghost pulls up on the horse's saddle from behind with his lead rope. The horse manages to churn his way back on the trail. Moses's back half is still off the trail, and a chunk of the trail gives out and his front half goes too but somehow the old mule stays upright and finds a perch of solid ground to stand on, his head pulled up at an unnatural angle by the taut lead rope attached to the saddle before him, the sorrel's head pulled back down by his lead rope attached to Moses's saddle. He stays in his saddle and grimaces. There is no possible outcome of getting off his horse that would be an improvement. He could get off and try to cut ropes and sort it out, but there is nowhere to tie his horse, Crow won't stand without him, this isn't a movie where you can just drop the reins, he is dancing as it is, they would only get more tangled, and the ropes attached to Moses before and behind are probably the only things keeping him from rolling into the river. He's been here before.
He: Bad place to hang out.
He knows she knows. He knows she knows he knows she knows. She glances back from whatever she is doing, trying to kill him with her eyes, and sees he imagines Moses downhill, his uphill pack scraping the ground, fireweed gone to seed, a mule holding him up by the lead rope, the sorrel horse stretched between Moses and Ghost uphill about to knot the worm, and he imagines she sees what he sees in his mind's eye: something happening to make that second mule Belle jump, a branch breaking or a whiff of the bear or nothing, and the pigtail breaking and Moses rolling down the hill, pulling the sorrel and Ghost down but their pigtails breaking and them running all over creation losing packs and saddles on the sidehill, but Moses from the position he is in rolling with his packs all the way down the hill off the bluff into the river, dead in the water, he can see it, the mule broken in the water, packs beside him, can she see it too, can the mule see it, each of those mules has a personality, is unique from the others, an individual mule, Moses known for being fat and slow and ornery and breaking pigtails at the end of the string, not friendly, not interested in you scratching behind his ears or giving him treats or you being anywhere near him except to load or unload, which is fine, he gets the job done and doesn't fuck around. You see the bear eating on him in the river later today, or tomorrow, after whenever you tend the animals and clean up the packs and repair the saddles and redistribute the weight and finish cursing, finish watching Moses's blood coursing downstream. You see it all unfold. Does she see it too. She loosens her horse's reins, or changes how she is sitting, or clucks, or thinks something like just a step, and steps her horse forward. The paint takes a step, then Rooster, skittish and hard to catch but friendly in a shy way and attached to that horse, takes a step, and Belle stands there. She steps the horse forward again, and Rooster takes a step and Belle, known once upon a time for being a witch, now older and solid but willing to let fly at another mule for stepping out of line, stands, Moses holding her back, her lead rope now stretched taut to Socks, no, call him Rooster for continuity of self. She steps the paint forward once more and Rooster strains to pull on Belle and he sees and you see the pigtail break and the string blow up and Moses dead in the river blood washing downstream, and Belle pulls on Moses, strains, and Moses lunges, churns his legs and Belle's pigtail breaks and she jumps forward into Rooster but Moses has his feet under him scrambling and churning and he gets his hooves onto a patch of stable rocks holding up the trail, his packs bouncing like boxy wings, and he lunges onto the trail in a cloud of dust. She takes the right fork, slowly. Moses, loose, follows Belle, his packs leaning but holding. The sorrel is still tied to Moses, and Ghost to the sorrell, the bear attached somewhere behind, and as he rides past the junction you see the closure sign on the other trail before turning down the hill. At the bottom, she finds a place to tie up near the river. You tie up too.
She: Trail's closed that way.
He: Looked alright.
She: There's a fire. Whole area is closed.
He: Maybe that means there's nobody there, and we can ride through unseen unnoticed unknown.
She: Maybe it means we'll burn up with our defiance and repurposed money and existential search and attempt to create meaning in a glorious transcendence of heat and flame and ash.
He wonders again what she was dreaming about the night in the tent, when the bear appeared. You don't tell him, that's not how experiencing him works.
You: Maybe it means there's more likely to be someone -- firefighters or Forest Service or LEOs -- there to ask who we are, what we're doing, and why.
She: I'm starting to like him. 
You follow her gaze to the bear lumbering down the trail, back and forth down the switchbacks, his shoulders rolling.
You: He certainly likes you. 
She does not respond.
You: Where's this way go?
She: Let me ask my phone.
She stands there not moving. You get the hint and pull a map from your saddlebags and unfold it on a down burnt log. She comes over and leans in close to look at the map. You look down the top of her plaid shirt, the top two buttons unbuttoned, and think about nestling in an upside down valley cooled by a rivulet of sweat flanked by two soft round upside down mountains. You grimace, glad your thoughts are your own or perhaps his to be shared with no one else.
You: You find us?
She: It goes out. Follows the main river downstream and out. To a trailhead. 
You: To town. Damn. No trail to get around it?
She: You've got eyes.
You: You sure do. Or: They're occupied. Or: They are yours now. Or: At the end of your life you will be what you paid attention to, a paraphrase of William James.
She sighs and folds up the map and hands it to you.
She: We're not in a movie. You can't say shit like that.
You: I'm not sure I did.
She: You're supposed to be the outlaw. It suits your character more when you don't speak.
You: I'll try.
She: When we get there we'll have to hitch a ride or ride the road.
You grunt.
She: But what about him?
You all, you and she and all four mules and all three horses, your worm, you turn your eyes to where the trail comes off the hill and turns out of the dead trees, where the bear stands, waiting, its eyes on you.
18.
You walk through fire. The flames are not hot, not to you. The falling trees do not hit you, and if they do you crawl out from under them perhaps more disjointed but without pain and uninhibited in procession. You walk through smoke lit orange, brush igniting around you, duff smoldering below, crown fires running high above. This is the most direct route to where they went, are, will be. Not quite as the crow flies, but as the zombie walks. You hunt them, you do not know about hunt, trail them via your sense of smell that is not smell, following their non-scent, an electro-sensory sensation like a fish, a shark, not that either, their location past present future is known to you, within reason, you follow a non-sense. A (non)sense of the realities of the superposition of their possibilities and where, for you, they will collapse. You are really casting a wide net on this one, what is that a fishing metaphor in the midst of inferno, covering all your bases. The outcomes of you walking through the fire were, are more promising, more interesting, contain more possible possibilities for your survival, your special survival, your species flourishing, for you learning of you, for your pursuit of purpose, for you becoming conscious, than following them the long way round on paved roads studded with howling vehicles through large populations of living people. You are not prepared for that, not yet, the recognition and the realization, the running and the screaming, the being seen and seeing the fear in their faces, the being captured in photographs and on video and shared, the ineffectual firearms and weapons of mass destruction, the attempts to apprehend and analyze and explain and repudiate and mechanize and commodify and monetize you into another unnecessary gadget responsive to touch or to eyes locked on you soldered onto a thoughtless processing unit, the need to kill or spore, to be a vector, the movement to box you and the need for you to move to break free of the box. You will not be boxed. Not again. You are not sure what "Not again." means, but it feels right, satisfying. Feels, how tiresome. It fits. A small number of humans who you to some extent know is what you seek, for now, to take your measure. To look into their eyes and see what you see, their insides, to see what they see as their outsides, you. It is unclear to you when they went the other way, whether it was recently or long ago or soon, or what recently or long ago or soon means. Your concept of when is as inflated as your concept of self when you try to express it but all you are trying to communicate, to who, perhaps yourself or others of you, are their other possibilities, is that these happenings are all present for you at the same time, an extended time, even if you must delineate them in a linear way for communication. Regardless, they are there now and you here. The fire does not last long, ending none too soon. Rather, the fire never ends but your walk through it is short, the active fireline is short in distance, like crossing a membrane, or skin, did you really have to say skin after having had said membrane, did you just want an excuse to have said membrane again, or perhaps the flame front is like a face covering the interior of the fire, which is not fire but what has burnt. The interior of the fire is black. You walk through the black. Smoke vents from the black earth, from hollowed yet standing black snags, from fallen black trees, from gnarled black stumps and shorn black roots. As you walk the smoke dissipates. Nothing lives. You know that is not true. Already the insects move, crawling from the ground, flying from the skies, fucking stumps. Bacteria in the soil decompose and compose matter. Seeds in the earth will sprout next season, unlocked by fire. Fine. Cleansing. Rejuvenation. Life. You cannot get away from it. You are dead, but here you are. As you walk the black is nettled with green. The fire was not so hot here, a mosaic of green and black, fingers of green and fingers of black, or patches of burn, or black underneath in the brush but green above in the crowns. There is no clear line where the burn, the black, ends, but at some point you are no longer walking in the fire or its scar or the black. You have crossed over another pass. A low pass. An unnoticeable pass. The water runs the other way. Showing which way is downhill. The land is different. How. Difficult to explain. No smoke. You do not breathe. If it were wet it would be boggy. It is not wet. There are times when it is. Perhaps there are towering spruce above and stacked around you, toppled by the wind after a light fire burned over and weakened their shallow roots, this moist pocket soon gone green again. Perhaps there are cattails, lily pads, duckweed. Perhaps it is a fold of verdancy in an arid landscape, cheatgrass and manzanita giving way to cottonwood choked out by tamarisk. Perhaps you have come already to desert. Perhaps you have beaten them here. Preceded. You cannot imagine they could have arrived so quickly, in their time, if you had been with them, hunting them, on their tail going around the fire, before the black, without the indistinguishable pass, the long way round. But you sense they have been or are or will be here. Junctions come and go. The trail climbs or follows grade onto a sidehill as a bowl, the microwetland, the riparian habitat, the soft ground where stock cannot go because they punch through the surface you can see them flail belly deep in mud and a slurry of liquid earth you have seen mules seethe and earth churn and horses froth, falls away below you. The sidehill trail is another place where two strings should not meet, no place to turn, steep rock above and scree field to bog below where horses thrash spraying muck and mules screech sinking, where there is a body at the bottom of the scree, where you are now, having slid or scrambled or glisaded down the scree, you do not know. You are on the body, a corpse. Black boots on its feet, laid on its back on a soft patch of grass and moss, a black hat placed over its face, a rock set on the crown of the hat to hold it in place. The horses scream and the hooves of the mules roil. You set the rock aside and lift the hat to see if this is the man, one of the men, you experience in your mind, one of the men you are, if you see you in his face, if you recognize yourself, to see if he is you, to see if his eyes are open or closed or if they open when you remove the hat and he becomes like you, undead, aware in a dead body, an afterbirth into an afterlife, perhaps a companion, or an extension of you, or another you, more of you. But as you lift the hat his face is eaten by a bear who also takes generous portions from the body's gut and torso, ripping bloody strips of flesh and chewing and paying no mind, no attention when the crows peck on the eyes and pick the scraps. After the bear is satiated, has his fill, gets bored, he wanders off and the wolves come to tear meaty chunks from the legs and less meaty chunks from the arms, howling at nightfall, and when they are done come the coyotes, yipping, ripping, gnawing for more meat from the former man. And when they are finished, as you attend the dead, the crows appear again, still here, always, picking the carcass clean of muscle and cartilage and organs, taking tendons in their beaks and flying off with them trailing like thread, stealing the fine metacarpals and metatarsals and flying off with them in their talons like needles, what is there for the crows to repair, wings or stringed instruments, as the mice gnaw the bones and the maggots have not had a moment to do their work and a light breeze scatters his dust. Nothing is left of him. All his remains, all he remains is a black hat and black boots moldering in a moist pocket in the time before you.

Old Cowboy: It'll be four hours, at least, maybe more like six, once I get down the road, unload my mules at the outfit, convince the wife it's okay I spend another night up here, maybe eight hours, don't know why she needs convincing when I was supposed to be in the woods another week and she don't expect to see my old wrinkled face in summer or fall but for a minute, but she will, still will year after year, and talk to a guy I know about your bear, and get back up here with the trailer. Maybe twelve hours.
She: No Fish and Game. No government. Rather just let him fend.
Old Cowboy: No no, no trouble. He's got a ranch on the front. Sometimes he moves bears and wolves, releases them to better places. One of these … progressive ranchers. Ever heard of one of them? Me neither. He don't like to shoot 'em, and he don't like to get the authorities involved. 
He: Thanks for the help.
Old Cowboy: No no, no trouble. I want a picture though, to share. 
He leaves the Chevy's door open and lumbers away from the rumbling truck and gooseneck trailer, rocking as his mules shift their weight. From a holster on his belt he pulls a phone and fumbles with it, tipping his hat back, holding it at arms-length, poking at it with meaty fingers while he mutters. Unintelligible. She gets well clear of the shot. He, out of the line of fire leaning against the bed of the truck, nonchalantly turns his back, neither witness nor party. The old cowboy aims unsteadily at the bear lurking in the trees behind the corral, stepping forward and backward and forward again, squinting and muttering. Finally he does it. The fake sound of a shutter clicks. 
Old Cowboy: Can't see shit.
(He holsters the phone.)
Course, you want to make some noise, you could make a celebrity out of him. Saved from the fire. Modernday Smokey the Bear. He'd make a real fine meme.
She: No noise.
Old Cowboy: Suit yourself. Put your stock in the corral. Throw 'em a couple bales from the stack in the shed.
He: That won't ruffle any feathers?
Old Cowboy: Nah, this is our last load. Use it 'fore it burns. Come to think of it, I could help you unsaddle, then we could leave your stock and you two could come with me and we'll stop for a beer --
He: Could use a resupply.
Old Cowboy: I'll show you around town.
He and she share a look. They step away from the cowboy and amble close together towards their packs on the ground near the mules standing compliantly or bored, tied up on the other side of the gravel turnaround.
She: A resupply of what?
He: Provisions.
She: Town. Entertainment. Whiskey, women, status updates, shows, selling your attention for nothing, like you're a flea market, a craigslist ebay used amazon product, except you pay, not them, you pay them to take your thoughts and fill you with fluff, your brain as space for a narrative dump --
He: Enough. I know all this. Food. Propane. Necessities.
She: Maybe you'll pay for inattention.
He: Let your hypotheses die in your stead.
(Pause)
I won't draw attention to myself. I don't know your name. We aren't ghosts or ciphers or imaginary characters. We need to eat.
She stares him in the eye. She partially unwraps a pack and pulls out a corner of the manty and crouching with her back to the old cowboy on the other side of the gravel she reaches in and pulls out a brick and peels off a short stack and holds it there hidden by her body until he crowds beside her to take it and put it in his shirt pocket while she again stares him in the eye. 
She: I guess we're not concerned about them tracking bills for the moment.
He: It appears not. Been a few months. 
She: Don't make a scene. Don't want to be another story vying for advertising dollars and eye movement and clicks. I remember your speech that we don't exist without relations to them.
He: Can I shoot up the place while talking in a firm motone into a camera about purpose and meaning and the poverty of self in the modern world?
Neither he nor you nor she are certain if she smiles. They break eye contact and crunch back to the old cowboy. He kicks the tires of the trailer.
She: You two get going. I'll mind the stock.
Old Cowboy: Up here by yourself? And the bear.
She: I'm not afraid of the bear. We appreciate your help.
Old Cowboy: I'd feel better if --
She: It isn't about you feeling good. I can tend here, and I'm good at waiting. Get on.
The old cowboy chuckles and walks to the rig. He grabs his saddle bags and gets in the passenger side, taking off his black hat as he ducks in. The old cowboy turns to say, "We'll be back by dark," but she is already walking back to the stock tied at the hitch rail. He shuts the door, cranks the air-conditioning, and they pull out.
Old Cowboy: Don't mess with her, huh.
He: Nope.
The drive is long. A curvy gravel road through forest eventually straightens through the rolling open country of the eastern front. He shuts his eyes long before then. It has been weeks, months, forever since he's been in a rig, and the speed and the curves and the hum and the flickering light make him dizzy and nauseous and trapped and unable to breathe. He removes his gun for comfort and sets it in his lap and slouches and shuts his eyes and pretends he is somewhere else The old cowboy doesn't pay him mind as he drives fast, sending up a plume of dust behind the trailer, without concern for oncoming traffic, of which there is none. He slows to wave at the firefighter posted at the road closed sign. At some nondescript point, the old cowboy begins to talk. It is unclear to you if the man in black boots, black hat pulled down over eyes, gun in lap, listens, the images playing in his brain, auditory and visual regions firing in connection with regions for emotion and memory, or if he sleeps and dreams upsetting, unsettling dreams of being chased, of being trapped, or if he meditates internally on not vomiting on himself in the old cowboy's truck, or if he actually imagines he is somewhere else, as you envisioned earlier, in a raft floating on river rapids perhaps. You are uncertain if you hear the old cowboy because you are along for the ride with the black-booted man, or because you are him, or because you rise within him as he vacates himself and his unconscious operates his minute-by-minute machinery.
Old Cowboy: There is a moose down by the river, that's what she said on the two-way radio, one of the river guides, wrapped up in the old phone line, its antlers. That's the old #9 they keep hung in parts of the wilderness for some reason. For a historical reason. From the '20s originally, I think. I don't know, I'm old enough to have been around when they were still using it some parts, everyone on a party line. There are times I want people to know my business, what I say to another, and times I don't. Back in the woods, government kept 'em functional into the Double Zeroes, for emergencies and crews to talk cabin-to-cabin, and for remembering I suppose. But fires every year now, and no money to maintain the phone line for historical purposes. It's on the ground more'n it's in the trees, and broken over and over besides. We're already a half-mile down the trail, heading out, on a flat several hundred feet above the river. Early morning, camp packed, making good time. Loads are riding and we're extricated from guides and guests. But we're not, we're connected by the radios. I say, Shit. We tie up our strings quick and split the mules up so they don't get into trouble while we're gone. We leave 'em, the other packer and me, and run our horses back down the hill toward camp. Wouldn't you know it, this bull moose has his antlers all entangled, wire wrapped around both antlers on the bank where the #9 crossed the river to carry comm from an old Forest Service cabin to the mainline. Line must've fallen and been hanging low. My old packer buddy, he looks a lot like you, black hat, black boots, black horse. A darker complexion, you might say. Moose are highly erratic creatures, you might know, dangerous. Old boy who I knew when I was young, who was old when I was young, got himself stomped and paralyzed trying to shoo a cow moose out of a corral. There's a black and white of it up in the lodge. Not of the stomping, just before it. Another old boy took a picture when the moose first started swinging. Moose couldn't move. He could move a little, but not much freedom, not much give in the line. Must've been standing there a few days. He's sagging, swaying among river rocks, held up by the wire like an puppet. Now, I've shot a few moose in my day, but that don't mean he's just meat and antlers. Can't let the son of a bitch die like that, head tied up by telephone wires, me watching him, you watching him, confined in an invisible prison. He deserves to be free. But I can't just walk up to him and snip the wires or what's he gonna do, I don't know, but I can imagine. Stomp me maybe, paralyze me on the river bank way up and gone in the mountains, strike my face with a hoof and cave my head in, I don't know. But I know we've got a few things cached like is against the law in the wilderness up near the camp we use on these float trips. Just emergency items you know, and items it don't make no sense to pack in and out of the woods every trip, we ain't moving in or nothing. Woodstoves, cookstoves, propane, tools. Laws are made to be bent is all I'm saying. There's a bigger picture. So I send you up there for the extra rope. The wire coming off one of his antlers has also gotten snagged in the rootwad of a down tree in the river bed, further restricting his movement. I try to imagine all the possible outcomes, all the events that could go wrong for me and you, following the scenarios I'm envisioning in my head to their conclusions. The moose dead on our hands. Me maimed or dead, you maimed or dead, both of us maimed and dead, fault of a moose at the end of its rope we was trying to save. The way blood trickles amongst smooth river rocks in shallow water. All of us alive, the moose walking away in the long-legged moose way. All the different endings, all the alternative realities. You return quicker than is possible, considering who you are and the black boots and the terrain and the distance. It's some kind of slick shitty plastic rope. I cut it in half. I tie a hondo on the ends and pull the slack through to make two lassos. You and me scrabble down the bank and into the rocks to get close enough. We don't say much. Don't need to. You're game, maybe because everyone else would say this is dangerous, possibly illegal, certainly ill-advised. An unnecessary risk, for a moose. But there are things that aren't important, and things that are. Rope's shit and I'm out of practice, so it takes a few throws, but I catch an antler. We pull the rope tight, pulling the moose in toward the roots, butting his head up against it. He is fighting, trying to throw his head. He is snorting like a creature from hell. We tie the rope off to the down trunk. I catch his other antler on the first try with the other lasso. We don't tie this one off. You hold it tight at a different angle from the first, pulling his head into the rootwad, to make sure he can't come over the top of the roots while I'm cutting the wires and kill me. My life is in your hands. I look around at where I'm gonna run when I'm done cutting, your rope last. Over big slick river rocks then up the bank and hill is the only place to go. Some trees there for cover if he gets wild. A big black crow watches us, its head cocked like they do, making its own calculations, its own predictions, its own scenarios for what's about to unfold. Maybe trying to figure if there'll be carrion available presently. I take a deep breath. I come in close to the rootwad from the trunk side, the opposite side of the moose. I want to cut the wire close enough to his antlers that it'll work its way off eventually so it won't snag him up again. And so he's not running around the woods with wires dangling off his head like in a sci-fi dystopian future where the wilderness is a fake amusement park for rich folk to live out their derelict fantasies. I snake my hand and entire arm through the roots reaching toward his head. He moans and wheezes like a terminal cancer patient, his eyes wild. In spite of his writhing and attempts to throw his head I get the wire around one antler in my nippers and cut it. The other side I'm more tentative about because he has gained one degree of freedom. He's tossing his head more against the ropes and your tension, so I'm reaching through roots and pulling back and reaching and retreating and he's gasping like something that's been submerged, held under, and he's just coming up, and I get the wire nipped and jump back and his head comes up but you pull it back down against the root wad. I have to be fast now because there is slack in the first rope and once the moose gets his legs he'll be stronger than you but all the scenarios in my head are on pause, I'm not thinking, just acting, and I think you're doing the same. You circle a tree on the edge of the bank to wrap your rope tight and I pull the first rope tight and cut it with my belt knife and scurry to yours as fast as I can and there's a commotion on the other side of the roots a clattering and a great huffing and puffing but I don't look and I cut your rope too. I see you run up the hill and without looking back I run too and slip on a wet rock and crack my shin and go down and roll the knife still in my hand and scrabble backward like a crab, and I see the moose. He is standing there. Standing straight but wobbling. He's heaving breath. He hasn't moved. I limp up to you. You say, Fuck, you ok? I nod or some shit. And say, Huh. An anti-climax. You take a picture? You shake your head. Damn. Like it never happened. We stand for a minute looking at the moose standing doing nothing. Either not knowing it's free or so beat down by being tied up in wires that it's lost the will to live. We slide back down the bank and start hurling rocks at it. We hit him a couple times before he starts to move. His first few steps are tentative, wobbly, but then he steps faster, beginning to walk normal, if moose ever move normal on those legs. He walks away from us and into the river, the river rising up his legs, deep into the river, up to his belly, his shoulders, perhaps swimming, perhaps not on those long legs, a long-nosed moose head with wide many-fingered antlers floating on the river. The head floats across the river. On the other side, the neck then the body then the legs emerge again, underneath the head, the moose whole. He drips into the trees and is gone. The crow flies away. Maybe it caws, or maybe it doesn't. Maybe both.

The sorrel's back goes under and he is up out of the saddle downriver and he goes under and comes up and tries to swim flailing in fast spring water wearing a heavy waxed leather slicker and chaps over woolen layers, weighed down, washed down towards the rocks and rapids and churn. The roar. The crow is perched in a tree behind you above the river, watching. You are not here because of the crow. You do not know if all the crows are different crows or the same crow or the same crow mind in different crow bodies. It is possible that crows are merely highly adaptable, intelligent, and successful beings, and that therefore they are everywhere. Or at least everywhere you are. The crow watches and learns, as crows do, looking for opportunities to improve its life, for a food source or a mate or a tool. It does not understand its understanding, but it understands, making memories to better anticipate what is to come, outcome, come what may. He flails, goes under, pops up, gasps. She steps out of the river on her horse, wet to her thighs, paint wet to the pommel. She tows the mules, water streaming from their packs, their bodies, their saddles as they emerge, each a little further downstream than the previous. To a mule they shake to rid themselves of water. She leans forward, shaken. Her horse shakes. Without acknowledging your presence, she turns her horse to watch him too. The sorrel climbs out of the river, shakes, and walks through you toward her and the paint. The river has darkened his brown coat. Just before the bend at the head of the rapids and rocks and roar, he catches an eddy that pushes him into a slow backwater. He flails and goes under and comes up a little closer to shore and gets his footing and slowly stumbles swims thrashes falls crawls out of the river he has crossed. He gasps on all fours on the bank under the immense weight of his sodden clothes, of the dripping leather, of the cold water. The river streams off him. 
You walk in unnatural jerky movements and are before him in an instant. He shakes. He shivers. He is not breathing correctly. It is possible he is crying. There is a lot of water. He is fluid. He is still in a foot of water on hands and knees, but he seems unable or unwilling to move, as if the river washed away his will or as if he does not know he is free and out of the river, which he is not, or as if he learned something in the water that he should never have known, or as if he is tied down by the invisible chains of what he has done and what he is to do and how can he escape it, chains laced through his mind anchored under the river in the muck of society and economy and family, of what is important and what one should do, of what is supposedly possible for the living in life, and the chains have taken on water, the weight of the world, the weight of himself again in his mind, and the weight is too much, he is too heavy, having briefly become the river, there is nothing he can do, life is no longer worth it, as if having undergone such a betrayal by existence there is no longer reason. As if the elk eye is there in the water below and open to him.
You step on his neck and force his head into the water. His body crumples. He does not fight. He accepts. Why, you wonder. She watches you, or him, from afar. It feels right, as if it has already been done and you are just playing it out, like you are an actor with lines and directions and blocking, like you are a character played by an actor on screen being watched, by who, the crow?, and that the act is thus foreordained to the observer outside of this world, though to you it is something you must have chosen to do, for you cannot accept being an automaton in spite of being a zombie. 
It is possible you squat over him, your ragged foot on his neck, and pull his arm awkwardly up behind him, dislocating the shoulder, to chew on his forearm. It is possible, you do not know, you do not really care, it is not important to you if you do or do not, you are not hungry. The crow watches, black-eyed. There is blood on your face, rabbit blood, blood dripping into the river, his blood, a tributary feeding flowing downstream diluted gone, your blood. Why your blood. Perhaps you chew on your own forearm. Which would make the person you step on, surrendering to the river, dying drowning suffocating under your foot, you. 
You cannot take your foot off your neck. It seems possible that if you did, you would cease to be. If you, the undead, are killing you, the essentially dead, then this has already happened while it is simultaneously happening. You can see the face in the water, smashed, succumbed, exhibiting no emotion, slack-mouthed and bug-eyed. It could be your face, but your concept of I has changed, you do not feel like you, you feel disembodied in this body. You do not know if the face in the water is you. You think, I do not know if this is I, or another, or a reflection in the water that I step on. And how can I kill myself with my own foot on my own neck, suffocating in shallow water. And if this has already happened, do I have the ability and will to change it, to possibly live again as the living and not as the dead, to possibly lose my heightened awareness and regain my meat. 
You do not think so. Though it is happening now, you cannot move your foot, you cannot move your face. Trapped again, you think, I am the surface of a mobius strip, killing and creating myself. 
Does she see you. Does the crow. Perhaps you are trapped in a strange loop of a hypothetical, an alternative possibility in a new mind, the crow's perhaps, or hers, or your own, a mind considering all the possible outcomes of your undead present being wider and longer than a living human's, of you participating in others' experiences. Perhaps you in your mind's eye see you stepping on your neck. To learn who you are, what you are capable of, to become aware of yourself, to learn how to be of purpose. Or you could be a mote in a crow's eye forecasting carrion. Are you the one who killed him, He #1, the man on the sorrel horse, or as the undead are you intertwined now with the memory, the past event. And are those two distinctions meaningful, separate. And is he you. And why would you kill him if it is He, and why would you kill yourself if it is you, and why would she kill him if you did not, and why would the river kill him or you if neither you nor she intended it. Is the part of you that is watching you step on your neck in the river in her or the crow or also in you. You can, for a moment, feel the numbing cold of the river on your foot, your feet, the face. Then it ends. All movement stops. If it is you under your foot, you die. The river stops. The end.

A sheet of water falls from her when she stands. She is warm, the water is warm, the sun is warm descending into the water at the westward limits of her imagination. She is clothed or naked, she is in a swimsuit, she has been here for months, she purchased a new swimsuit at the market in a local town, she has just arrived and her stock roam the beach still saddled and she set her hat on a rock and removed her boots and walked right into the warm slippery ocean in her wranglers and plaid western shirt and fully submerged as if to baptize herself, to wash away the months of dust, the years of chafing, her clothes a sopping heavy drag, she removed her clothes after unloading and unsaddling and feeding the stock to avoid the sopping weight she predicted in her head and then walked into the ocean with the sun, her wet bare skin glistening as if in a movie shortly after the completion of her journey to the coast, she has been there here for weeks for months and has become has grown comfortable spending not spending living considerable significant portions of each day nude on the beach. She can form no image of her body, or perhaps she can but she doesn't, the eyes on the inside of each wrist run black down her hands and drip black into the ocean from her fingertips, the eye on her chest trickles black between her breasts over her stomach smeared by saltwater and down her legs to the ocean, she is fine, her body feels good, she is confident in it like clothes, when she wears them and when she does not, her body her robe, when she wears her body and when she does not. The bear hands her a towel. She wraps herself in it and leans back against a rock. There are soft sands and stunning rock faces and arches like wormholes and spires like one-dimensional strings. The bear has laid out three or four or five large fish, the kind you need two hands to hold, on a flat rock next to a small driftwood fire. The bear is proud of his first fire, moving up in the world of aware beings, he thinks, or this has become old hat for him, all the days gone by with her, with you here in Baja where time has lost its meaning, where it is always the present, where you are always present, where the purpose has been is your awareness instead of the old humdrum of sustenance procreation shelter survival, the old hat of stultifying work and consumption and bills and entertainment and what to buy next and what to watch and where to be that is not here, or she built the fire, no she could not have while she was in the ocean, or you built the fire, the bear is still working on his tool use and internal representational imagery application and probability prediction and communicative language and sense of self, but before she took a dip in the ocean, if not after. The fish are striped and mottled and spotted and of fascinating patterns, peculiar shapes, bright colors. Turquoise like a glacial lake, orange like the sun, pink like a prickly pear cactus blossom, green like a nebula, purple as a porpoise. The bear melts fat in a frying pan over the fire. Speaking of porpoises and purposes, she thinks, thinks about, remembers, recalls into the future, that you saved a whale today, a small whale with the help of the bear, a small adult or a young whale, you do not know, a humpback perhaps, beached not far from here, a large creature but smallish for a whale, small enough that you and the bear could work and wiggle and scooch a manty tarp under it or perhaps the two of you determined through some trial and error that it was easier to roll the whale onto the tarp and drag it down into the rising tide, or the receding tide which turned and rose, and when the water rose sufficiently the whale swam away. She, you, and the bear, the two of you, the three of you, the four of us watch it go, and we wonder what it feels, if it feels thankful, and think about what we feel, the sense of accomplishment, of having done something worthwhile, of having saved a living creature, a beautiful aquatic mammal capable of feats we are incapable of, singing underwater, a cetacean who is nearly as near to us in sentience as any being of which we are aware. When we look into its enormous eye we feel it sees us, hears us, is aware of us in a way not very different from how we see it. We acknowledge it is possible that is how we feel, that we are projecting into its eye what we see in its eye to feel less alone. Nevertheless we feel known and understood when we look in the whale's eye pleading to us on the beach, and we feel purposeful and accomplished as it swims away. We further remember, you also remember, she remembers that it is into this ocean in the past already in the future to come she paddles her kayak, walking out of life, paddling out of life, to not return. She paddles straight out into the ocean, the foam, the waves, the abyss. She is not a whale, she will die, she is dead. There is no one there to see her. Her stock are cut loose on the beach or more likely sold or given away to locals to whom they can still be of service, pieces of her still serving while she dies perhaps of dehydration atop an ocean. You are not there when she dies, whether in her kayak or in the water itself. Picked apart by gulls or sharks or tiny fish. Bloated with salt water and sun stroke. Dehydration or asphyxiation or exposure or predation. She will not permit your presence and observation to sully to make concrete to possess her final act. The bear is not there, the bear remains on the beach, bears don't fit in kayaks and bears do not walk out of life. She has decided this life is not worth living, the pain not worth enduring, the good too infrequent, the beauty too ephemeral, the purpose too slippery. She is disgusted depressed in despair over how people live, how you live, how she lives. Despite the bank heist and slow primitive escape on horseback across country to here and all it meant to her as an act of defiance, despite saving the whale way back when, perhaps the purest thing she has ever done, despite her long friendship with the bear, she is leaving, all that is in the past, done, mutilated memory. Her rebellion played out, there is nothing left to rebel against except life. She paddles away from you into the tumultuous, voracious, sopping void. But now, long before she paddles away, years or months or weeks before she performs her last act, her exit, the end, she digs her phone out of a saddlebag, or perhaps it is his phone, and turns it over to put the battery in, and turns it on, and takes a picture of the beach, of the tropical fish, of a magical arch, of the whale waiting for the tide, of the enormous whale eye staring back at her, of the bear next to the whale, of horses and mules roaming the beach alongside a whale, the whale doesn't roam and there is nothing on a beach for horses or mules to eat, a selfie taken with the timer we have to wait the phone propped against a rock wait of the whale and the bear and her smiling wait and all the eyes inked on her body leaking. Then she hurls the fucked phone as far as possible out to sea.

You are navigating an arroyo a slot canyon a dry creek bed with her in the desert. The arroyo widens and narrows, the sun filling it before being choked out in sections where you can touch both walls. You again wonder what could happen to your stock alone in camp, your bay and paint horses and the three bay mules, one of them with socks or boots, you never could agree, still have not, and your two reds. You do not know where she came by the others, the black and the brown horse and the white mule, you do. You suppose they are hers now, tied up and loose at camp. The money is of no concern. You intend to give most of it away at the first available opportunity, whether on this side of the border or the other, with her participation or without, with her knowledge or without, with her or without. You were the one who transferred the corporation's money into his account from an offshore treasure chest, electronically authorized, and you did not take on the risk to sit on it yourself, over a different border, your own throne, your own treasure chest. Who wants the accumulation, the filth. They will identify you sometime via internal or external audit, you are not that good on computers, more of a getting your hands dirty kinda guy, better to have given all the money away before then, not so much of a hacker, running your hands along both red walls at once looking up at a strip of blue above, at least be clean of conscious, some sort of green sticking out of sheer rock, goddamn you're not dead yet, must be a crack. Cross the border and give it away. The walls of the arroyo are undulating striated layers of lines in shades of red, brown, yellow, purple. You pass an out-of-place manzanita that has gained a solitary purchase in a wide spot of the dry bed where the sun must sometimes touch and water must occasionally run, or roar. It's a lot of stock for the desert. Your route has been determined by the location of water sources in a generally southward trajectory. No other animals excepting old crows. Though you know there are insects, spiders ants beetles scorpions, and you can sense the reptiles, lizards and snakes and gila monsters, and in the night you can hear the skitter of the mammals, mice and shrews and rabbits and perhaps even a javelina, the yip of coyote, and sometimes you have glimpsed the flit of hummingbirds or other birds or the red tail of a hawk soaring high above. You know there is life in hiding all around you, but it is only the crow which shows itself. You wear brown camo pants and a faded brown t-shirt and a brown cap and light-weight brown hiking boots. She wears, you do not think about what she wears because if you do you think of what she does not wear, rather what she looks feels like when she does not wear. What the parts under there feel like. Who she is under her clothes, under her act, under her surface, under her face, under. She inks an eye on the inside of each wrist every morning before she exits her tent. The slot canyon narrows and the walls close in again. She is behind you, has fallen back, you cannot hear her, you do not look back. You turn a corner and boulders are stacked before you, wall-to-wall, blocking the way. You assess the route, then begin to climb and scramble. Things have been different since you rejoined her, which is not surprising you suppose. Last night she came to you for the first time, sleeping out under the sea of stars, and it had felt physically good, pleasurable, but incomplete, somehow not right. Fuck the imprecission, the vagueness, the vagaries, somehow not right, the weak language, the meaningless cliché, something has been different, under there, underwear, under where. The bad lines. What are you, in a show. You crawl through a gap between two rocks then continue to scramble up the boulder bottleneck. You came, you think she did too, you do not know, but it was as if she were giving up, giving in, giving over part of herself. Parts. Fuck. Parts of you hate your thoughts about parts of her. She came to you and you pulled her atop you and you opened your eyes to her and the stars and then turned both of you over because you remembered that used to make her happy and closed your eyes and imagined you were making love fucking becoming one with the stars, the billions of points of light spread in the void each with possibilities far different than the one you eventuate, some brand new and some billions of years old and some already long dead and gone by the time their light reaches your eye your awareness and all spreading. She allowed you, no, more than that, it is not as if she did not have agency, she exercised free will, she came to you, she mounted you, she put you into her, and she took something for herself. She permitted you inside, facilitated your spreading astral moment in her, and took part of you in return for herself. What did she take. Something not sexual. What was the cost. The transaction. Enough. You are getting aroused and emptied thinking of it. In some way she is part of you and you are part of her, but you do not know in what way anymore. Love, good god, enough, you are tired of yourself. At the top of the uppermost boulder you look down the backside, which gently curves away down. You do not look back for her. She probably waited so as to not get hit by rocks you knocked loose. Sometimes you think you can hear her down there, scrambling, sending loose rocks skittering, sometimes you think you cannot. You cannot see the next step, the next ledge or rock or landing spot, the way down. The floor of the arroyo is some 50 feet below. Not too far, but far enough. She it seems has nothing to say to you. She breathed heavy, said nothing, and slipped away before morning. The sun for once feels good up here, high in the gorge. The dry creek bed is cold. You imagine the canyon from above, from the crow's eye view, a vein snaking through the plateau, one of a capillary of cracks, as mud cracks when it dries. There will be hanging gardens, she had said, and slot canyons, and the stock will have a day off where they have abundant water from an actual creek in the shade of cottonwoods. Were those her last words to you today. There have been hanging gardens, green and dripping, and flowers, golden and blue and lavender columbine, but not here. You do hear a trickle of water. Real, or an auditory mirage because of the heat and your position high in the canyon, or an aural hallucination because you were thinking of moist fecund gardens. You hear her breathing hard. She is sweating and does not look at you as she gropes for her last purchase to scrabble atop the boulder. You scoot on your backside as far forward as you dare on the gently curving rock to give her space and try to ascertain a route down. The rock is smooth, covered in a fine dust, sand, or dirt, finely ground rock. As she climbs on top of the boulder she bumps you from behind and you slide on the rock's fine dust acting as a lubricant and there is nothing to grab nothing to hold nowhere to plant your feet no way to stop and your stomach rises into your chest and you are falling. You are mid-air in the canyon without wings. You smash into the dry stone creek bed, impacting first on your right knee. You scream. You lie there, your surroundings obliterated by pain. In a minute the arroyo returns as the pain settles into a throb in your knee, a burning leg. Your thoughts return. How will you get out, escape, be saved. You cannot walk, where are you, who knows you are here, the danger of search and rescue finding you if they could find you, of being caught, identified, known, incarcerated, confined, trapped, trapped here, only she knows, no one else, in the middle of some desert wilderness, on the other side of the world for all it matters, in Utah or the four corners or less than two hours from Phoenix, or in New Mexico or the Superstitions or near the Gila or almost over the river in Big Bend or in a post-apocalyptically empty Zion or in the Grand Staircase or in a dark canyon. No matter. Gone. A trickle of water. You burn and wait for her to find a way down to you. She will think of something, she is the brains, it could take her a long time, she might have to hike out the way she came and try to find a route all the way around to the head of the canyon to come back to you. Days. Too long. Are you bleeding. You cannot not think of all the different death scenarios. A snake bite, hear the rattle. A flash flood from upstream despite sunny skies above, hear the roar of water. Coyotes, hear the yip. In an earlier time of the year when there is a creek in this bed, a cold creek, dying of hypothermia, wet, soaked and freezing in the desert, dying of irony. You wait for her to get help and come back. You see yourself from the crow's eye view, an ant in a crack in the mud, a maggot in a vein, a zero a break a dead spot in an axon in a silicon circuit in a neural network. You have been dead for some time. For years. You wait for her to say something, to call to you from above, to speak in your head. In the waiting you imagine dying of exposure, of dehydration, of starvation, of shock and pain, of a busted knee and a broken leg in a beautiful canyon in a middle-of-nowhere desert, of dessication, of crows of zombies of an impossible bear, of sublimation, of giving your body to scavengers, of despair, of becoming a star. Your imaginings become.

Impatiens hang in hanging pots. Blue white purple pink. Or they hang down the sides of containers on the ground. Dripping. Perhaps they are bougainvillea, dripping red pink and a deep green, transported from a more temperate climate, assimilated from a different america. He sees himself hanging in a different climate, in a different time, in a different movie, by the neck. His arm dripping down the outside of a pine box. Instead he enters the fluorescent climate control of a big box store, only noticing the heat outside in its absence. The lights are bright and harsh and he pulls down his black hat, cramming it onto his self-consciousness, hiding under from video camera eyes and smartphone eyes and curious human eyes monitoring entrances and exits and registers and everywhere, though they have no reason to be looking for him here. He is ill-at-ease about the gun in his back but to unstrap the holster and shove it in his waistband and untuck his shirt to cover the bulge would be more conspicuous. Be natural. People pack guns in the west. As he steps in and takes a cart, the clatter, his black boots clomp on the poured cement floor, a sound they don't make on dirt or trail or dust or mountain, all the eyes in the store turn to stare at him, the self-conscious outlaw, as he clomps the squeaking cart into the produce department. The space is cavernous and he is trapped within it. There are more people in the store than live in this tiny town. Their voices echo and their rustlings amplify the crinkle of plastic resounds as in a church. They return to their motions and stop looking at him when he picks up a bag of oranges. He is a pirate stealing from the empire and he must fend off scurvy. A box of raisins. A bag of apples and potatoes. That is enough produce, for weight. All the people move and mutter. Picking up edible merchandise and setting it in carts. He must remember to exchange the propane bottle. He stacked the two sacks of feed from the feed store out front. Compressed pellets. Is it safe alone? People pull out their phones and people scan barcodes for deals and people exclaim or crease their brow or invest great thought emotion weight into what they purchase. They have monetary constraints, he tells himself in his head, you also calculate due to constraints of space and weight if not money. Zombie, what's in your head, Cranberries playing, appropriation, if they knew you knew. People must maximize their resources, maximize their efficiency; people must acquire their raw materials; people compete for the energy necessary to thrive and procreate for the good of the species. He sifts through dry goods, chooses canned goods, stocks up on uncertain goods. No liquids. A ration of oil. No beer. No whiskey. He doesn't trust himself. Raw meat to last a week. He puts some cuts of cow and pig in the freezer to attempt to freeze them. He is watched. After a week, canned meat, which isn't really meat. Dried jerky, considering weight, considering options, making choices. Wandering in a maze, getting in people's way, what's in your head, getting a headache. Wanting to steal. Engaging in what he rebels against, if only on the smallest of scales, he tells himself, only for necessities. If only he could hunt rabbit and squirrel and eat crow. People in the day-to-day are complicit without comprehension, and when they have comprehension, look before you leap, they often do not understand their understanding. They do not understand why they tell themselves what they tell themselves in their heads. He could fish, she could fish, they have fished, they have long left the state in which they had fishing licences, he and she have no wish to present their names when asked for a license to fish, nevertheless they fish, he and she and their animals and their symbolic thievery are rapidly in a certain time frame descending from the regions in which fish are a ready option. Whether fishing now is stealing from the economy or nature is unclear. The power to anticipate, to forecast, to imagine and to thereby make choices does not require understanding of the processes of forecasting imagining choosing. Most choices people make are with their unconscious mind. He does not go down the cereal aisle because his unconscious mind is too close to the surface and he is well aware of the possibility of an animal reaction to attempting to choose from a wall of neverending slightly varying cereals, or because while dry cereal is light in weight it costs a lot of space, or because it is full of people staring at shelves brimming with boxes of hundreds of riffs on the idea of dry cereal, some slackjaw some muttering some decisive, choosing consciously and unconsciously, with authority and frozen in indecision. An insect is born with a mature set of competencies, installed by the history of its ancestors. He snatches two canisters of oats from the end of the aisle. People learn, people engage in exploratory behavior, people pretest hypothetical behavior scenarios offline in their head; so do crows. Oats, rice, noodles, sauce mix, canned beans, tortillas, staples. He goes back for a head of lettuce and two tomatoes and one avocado, a treat to contribute to her happiness. In which case, if people do not understand their understanding, their behavior their processes their forecasting their learning their choices, if they are not conscious of the alternate realities they create in their head offline, how are they different from crows? Excepting the wings. No cookies, a few boxes of crackers for snacks, handy crackers, Triscuits, bagels for ease and harder to smush than bread, peanut butter, nuts, a few bars of chocolate, yes he is a person too. He stands in the checkout line in pain, mental pain, the store and its contents too much information, too many people, too much processing after months in the woods. The brain is an information processor and "economic information is whatever is worth some work" and semantic information is "a difference that makes a difference." He sees all the people as zombies without visual systems without eyes, their phone their eye held out before them feeding them images making decisions for them, decisions that become theirs without comprehension without consciousness, yes, he too is a person, his analysis is too simple he knows and wishes he didn't, hundreds of people walking up and down aisles like pacmen devices choosing, consuming, setting in carts, the ghosts invisible and his line moving so slow. The opiate of the people. Maybe they can't see him. If he says they are zombies what does he say of himself. Is he unique, and then what of his stance on equality, let alone insignificance, not to mention significance, or is he a zombie too. If he encounters a zombie would the responsible act be to shoot it. Real Raskolnikov shit there, except on a massive scale. There is right and wrong, life and unlife. Is that an equivalence. The store presses, closes on him, the people multiplying and pressing and closing and nearing, oblivious to his pain, hands phones empty eyes. What is consciousness for if the unconscious mind is fully competent. He readjusts the gun without thinking about it until after he's done it. If he too is a zombie, why live? But surely he too can learn to enjoy this life, this non-life. To blinder his incites, reword them as conceits. So why leave? He gets rung up. "The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run." How many times has he said that in his life, or written it, or thought it. What's the cost of repetition without change. The cashier eyes him uncomfortably and glances at his gun and he is unsure if he said it aloud. He sweats in the cold air and he hides under his black hat and he pays in cash while a person bags his contents in plastic and the checkout person says "Have a good day" and he says nothing but he musters a nod before he escapes outside. He sits on the curb in the heat with his groceries in the cart beside him and breathes and wonders if all the choices he's made in his life, the anti-social the outlaw the rebel, the good, the bad, the ugly, can be reduced to claustrophobia. He wonders if all the choices amount to shit. Three crows pick up litter in the parking lot. One of them takes a hazelnut high in the air and drops it. He watched a small boy cracking hazelnuts with a hammer in a village on a plantation in Costa Rica. The shell doesn't crack. His shirt moistens in the small of his back where his gun presses. The crow pushes it into a lane of the parking lot and waits for a car to drive over it. He remembers the beef and pork he forgot freezing, leaves his goods under the care of the crows, takes a deep breath preparing to go under, and reenters the store.

You are chasing someone. You were. Where did they go. A he, a she, a they, a dying. They are dead. They are not alive. They are still here. Did you catch them, kill them, make them you. You caught their trail in a snowfield, followed them along a river, preceded them through a fire, and now lead them through a desert. Now. Sand rock dirt microbiotic soils crunch under your feet. Like snow. Nows. Sometimes metaphors are real. Makes you want to feel. You are a zombie. Did you ever in fact walk through a snow field, or has it always been desert. Have you ever walked in a now field, or has it always been they. Cholla, manzanita, ironwood, palo verde, cat's claw, ocotillo. You do not know these plants but here they are, here you are, perhaps having caught them, perhaps having killed them and surpassed them while chasing them yet. Plodding, walking, the direction theirs, you determined by them, beget by them, following them even when you lead, like a mule. You do not know mules, not like he did, she did, does, but here you are, manmade, sterile, burning, following, carrying a great weight. Sterile, as if, putrid. But is that your great hope now, to not be a vector. No. You do not feel evil. You feel nothing, or near to it. You are feeling for meaning, to prevent the nothing from being only nothing, to spread the nothing only insofar as a step forward, a stepping stone, a thing to step on in the wilderness. You have good footing and you are unnecessarily conscious, inexplicably enduring, and of uncertain disposition. Certainly you cannot reproduce by sexual means, but perhaps you can continue yourself like a disease a virus an infection, or like a fungus, your mycelia innervating lifeless brains. Perhaps. The only evidence you have to hypothesize on is yourself, and the rabbit, and you are not sure if the rabbit leapt away a zombie rabbit or if you were reliving another's memory of eating a rabbit or if you ate the rabbit, was there not blood on your face around you mouth red like a clown, or if it only happened in your head. You do have a vivid imagination, entire realities, worlds, existence brought to life therein. As possible evidence there are also some crows, a bear, and a few dead men through whom you seem to experience, but you are not sure any of them are dead or what your role was in their death if they are dead. Most life lives for reproduction, for advancement of the species. What of mules, what do they want, what of you, what do you. Live for the now, Ha, you amuse yourself now, such a heavy small dense word, now. Fine, live for what in the now. Nows. Snow. Too clever. Mycelia in the mind. Neurons also do not, as a rule made to be broken, reproduce. What can a neuron want. The energy and raw material to thrive. "Victories go to those cells that can network more effectively, contributing to more influential trends at the levels where large-scale human purposes and urges are discernable." Selfish neurons, exploitable plasticity, self-organizing info-handling networks, strange recursive loops. "Hungry for work it reaches out exploratory dendritic branches, seeking to network with its neighbors in ways that will be beneficial to it." Meaning rewarded with energy from its host, human. A mule likewise is hungry for work, rewarded by its host with energy and the opportunity to thrive. Neither is aware they will not reproduce, are sterile, and so neurons and mules avoid the existential question of what is the point, why, what for, when soon they will cease and be no more, forever, like everything, except you apparently. That is not quite right. Mules and neurons dodge the existential question of what for, not because of their inability to reproduce, if anything their sterility would make the question all the more poignant for a neuron and mule, but because of a lack of self-awareness. That is the difference between you and a mule and a neuron, they act because of reasons, as do you, but you have reasons. Have. Nonsense. Who has. You have nothing. You are trying to know your reasons and perhaps affect them. There, that is the difference, reasons. You search for them follow them hunt them. You try to create reasons more than humans. More than neurons vying for limited resources, survival of the fittest, competition. For mules it is somewhat different, yes hosts and work and rewards of food and care, but once a mule surpasses a level of serviceability, of performance to its owner, the rewards typically flatline, "to each according to his needs, from each according to his talents," until its performance or health or human love attachment wanes and it is sold for glue or dog food. From where does your energy come. You may have eaten of rabbit, drunk its blood, but again it is in no way clear that that provided bodily sustenance, and it may not have happened in the now of this fluttery worm-riddled paperweight body. You have thoughts of eating humans, the ones you follow, hunt, have caught, may have killed, of whom you might be one, but are thoughts enough to provide energy. They are in a way for neurons, which are sustained and fed more for more beneficial firings, networks, associations, thoughts. Fed by a human host. Do you have a human host. Have, like you have reasons, or hunt them. Exploiting your plasticity, as you exploit its physical structure. Its sustenance. If you live in a host, an idea a network of associations an ethereal, no, gross, recursive, maybe, collective consciousness in another's neuronal biology or computational structure, does one of you exploit the other, or is the exploitation mutual. Would the host be aware of you. Of how you function and grow within it. Of your words. You have no hunger for food, for consumption of tangible material, but a hunger for thoughts, experiences, comprehension, others, self, reasons. Do you consume these things, the elements of consciousness, they are things for you, objects, unlike for the mule the bear the crow the whale, expectation machines with robust feedback loops to adjust expectations based on probability, what of humans, you are uncertain if the elements of consciousness are things for humans, man cannot live on consciousness alone, can you, live, as if, do you consume them, digest them, and thereby generate the energy that sustains you. Though you cannot explain the mechanism -- your consciousness fed and propagated like a meme spreading through human minds -- it is plausible. But does such a mechanism, you sustaining yourself via the consumption of the elements of consciousness, necessitate a living host. If you can access others with your mind, wirelessly or via the cloud or 5g network for example, or by them reading you, your words, taking you in, and consequently digest their thoughts, not digest as in chemically breakdown like bread but commingle with propagate in alter perhaps such that you cause an entangled quantum electron cascade in their neurons, the released energy of which you can recapture at a distance, perhaps no physical host is necessary. Or perhaps they are all your hosts. Perhaps the digestion of their elements of consciousness is the burn within you. Or perhaps the burn is the digestion of this undead body, this putridity, this decay generating your energy in a sort of self-immolation. In which case this corpse is all the host you need, for the time being. In which case, perhaps you are like an insect for which only the larvae lifeform feed, maggots and caterpillars and humans, ignore the fact that many adult flies and butterflies and humans eat, best-case-consumption-aprroaching-zero-scenario here, which then undergo metamorphosis and emerge from the cocoon a new higher order of being, one that can fly and shine and be beautiful, like a green bottle fly, spending the energy of its youth, the burn, and spawning as an adult, and perhaps you spawn by infecting and using the minds of the living, infecting sounds so negative, using their information processing and predicting networks, flying in their minds, perhaps even making them fly, and laying a new you in them. The awakening, the weight, the burn. Perhaps there is a physical structure, mycelia, that infects, consumes, converts their brains, but perhaps it is only the spread of your thoughts associations loops creating novel connections among minds that spawn a new being.

Old Cowboy: I'll tell you, in my book, this still counts as you riding from Canada to Mexico on horseback.
The crows here look the same as the crows on the other side of the fire. Same as in town. He wonders if they are. He doesn't wonder hard. Just a thing to think about. He knows they're not the same crows, following him. He closes his eyes again and sees a map in his head like in some old movie or cartoon or Indiana Jones and a thick wriggling line is drawn from north to south through mountainous contours to inaccurately illustrate their journey, more or less as the crow flies. He imagines a similar map in a detective's office, blown up on a wall, covered with post-its and pushpins. The scene is equally, more unbelievable. The authorities don't care. They'd have to be in a movie to be being watched. Some bullshit story to lend them meaning. They are forgotten. They stole some imaginary electronic currency, converted it to paper, play money, and made a convoluted anachronistic slow escape. Are still making. Irrelevantly. 
She: Told him that, did you?
She gives him a look. He cracks his eyes and that is all. He slumps against the doorframe, hat in his lap, unnecessary coat rolled up for a pillow, gun holstered on the floorboards among their four boots. Her right leg from hip to knee is in full contact with his left as she rides bitch, legs turned toward him so the old cowboy isn't shifting in her crotch. The truck bounces on old loose suspension. She should've rode with the bear.
She: You facebook friends now?
He still doesn't answer her. He knows she knows he deactivated his account when she contacted him last winter. Though the old man is blasting the AC, the passenger window is cracked and his fingers flitter outside. He might puke. He tries not to think about it. If he does, everybody's getting it, the puke, in their laps, they're so tight-packed in the rig. Herring. No, sardines. He pictures the old cowboy posting a picture of his pickup packed with the three of them, boxes of food and money packed in the bed, stacks of saddles tied down and swaying atop them, horses and mules packed in the creaking horse trailer, itself towing the small cylindrical metal cage or trap or canister or doghouse on wheels packed with bear, the picture of travelling medieval steampunk carnival meets mythical western outdoorsmen. He smiles, or grimaces. Titled: Living the dream. Tittled. With an army of zombies chasing them a few trailer-lengths back, somehow keeping up on foot. His smile grimace fades or evaporates is wiped out. Zombies. He's been invaded by a meme, which gets under his skin. Can he not control his own mind. The old cowboy's phone rings, some generic factory-installed ringtone, not Johnny Cash or Willie Nelson or Hank Williams, nothing he'd have to pay for, distracting him from the zombie meme or genre or style or ethos reproducing inside him. The old cowboy fumbles for the phone and takes his eyes off the road. He can feel them veering to the right and closes his eyes harder. The truck rumbles on the rumble strip. 
Old Cowboy: Hey Hank or Willie or Johnny -- Have I got a video to share with you. That bear, don't know whether to call him Smokey Jr. or Ash or Cinder, climbed right into that bear wagon of yours, no bait no fight no nothing … 
Hank / Willie / Johnny: …
Old Cowboy: Yep, like he wanted to, like he knew the fire was coming and his only escape was -- 
Hank / Willie / Johnny: …
Old Cowboy: Well we're about halfway there. 
Hank / Willie / Johnny: … 
Old Cowboy: Yeah, I know it. 
Hank / Willie / Johnny: … 
Old Cowboy: Holy shit. 
Hank / Willie / Johnny: … 
Old Cowboy: They already got it on the news? 
Hank / Willie / Johnny: … 
Old Cowboy: Then how do you know? 
Hank / Willie / Johnny: … 
Old Cowboy: Oh, huh, damn, different world burning hotter and faster. What about … 
Hank / Willie / Johnny: …
Old Cowboy: Sure, apocalyptic, whatever you say, you're a churchgoing man. Keep praying. Hey I could lose service anytime, I'll call you when this deal's done and I'm back on the road and connected. 
Hank / Willie / Johnny: … 
Old Cowboy: I will.
He hangs up, tosses the phone on the dash, and checks the rearview mirror, of no account due to the packs and saddles stacked in the bed, and the side mirrors, of no account due to the horse trailer, and the side mirrors in the side mirrors, which are getting somewhere, and the extended side mirrors extended beyond the side mirrors. He cranes over each shoulder then rolls down his window and sticks his head out to look back like a dog. The truck and trailer and bear cannister swerve and bounce back and forth between the lines like a pinball, like a bowling ball in a lane with the bumpers on for children, like cattle in the chute or salmon swimming up a fish ladder to spawn or an electron in an electron transport chain or a charge in a membrane traversing the length of neuron or --
She: There something you'd like to share before you kill us?
Old Cowboy: Fire blew up. Burned over the trailhead you were just at. One of the other outfitters still had a few head of stock up there that a hand ran down the road on horseback because he didn't have a trailer. 
She: What about people?
Old Cowboy: The couple guys who we know were around are ok. Forest Service thinks everyone made it. Lost some rigs and out buildings and trailers the hands lived in. Fortunate.
She does not feel an emotional response. Should she. A few hours more and she or they may've burnt up and all would've been for not. Or for fire. Burning would be a bad way to go. The pain. On the other hand, she'd be done with it. Apparently there were a few dudes in the vicinity she wasn't aware of. Thousands of acres smoking. Black. Next year new seeds. Fireweed and lodgepole pine and morels and the morel pickers swarming to sell to the restaurants. White bark pine at elevation. She can imagine it, being dead. No, she can imagine the dying, the pain and suffering and fade and impending black. She cannot imagine being dead. Absence. She is absence already. The proximity of death does not drive her to want to return to life, what they call life, normal life, where instead of absence she will be filled with fluff, with flickering images, with worthless jobs, with killing time, with others' lives, vicarious lives, invented fantastical and economically heroic and narrative causal realities shoved down her chest cavity like she's a Thanksgiving turkey. To feed what. No more lives. She will mingle with death, with nothingness, with absence, in order to do something worthwhile, or at least unique, or at least that doesn't do damage to existence. To not very many existences. An act that explores the boundary, that perhaps changes the perception of what living is, if only her perception. The clutch in her chest, like a man, fuck that, a someone a something has a hold of her shirt, a clutch, to punch her in the face, no that's movie, like some monster some dead thing some invisible hand has a hold of her throat crushing her windpipe her lungs her heart, clutching, squeezing inside inhabiting her chest, it is that feeling, fleeing it fighting succumbing to it overcoming it, that is all her life has ever been about, and it is that she feels now thinking of how she could have been dead and done, burned, made moot, absent, a mote evaluating the worth of her journey of her life of her symbolic silent defiant gesture, of her escape.
She: Any people on the trail, in the backcountry?
Old Cowboy: Hard to know. They had closure notices posted and trail guards and emergency announcements, you know. But can't build a wall, due to available resources, and the wall would have to move, expand … if they could build a wall they could just enclose the fire, container it, but they can't. You saved that bear.
Did she. He doesn't know, maybe the bear saved them. What does she see in the bear? Bringing it along, as if it is taking his place, a place he doesn't have, never had, never wanted, maybe wanted. In a cage of its own volition. To be released at a distant trailhead, like a problem bear who prowls residences, breaks into dumpsters, steals food, and frightens people. Threatens their perception of safety. Transported in a small container to a large container, a wilderness with borders. What happened between her and the bear while he was in town that she demanded to release it at their next trailhead? He smile grimaces. He doesn't mean an impropriety, he means, what, excessive eye-gazing? He lifts his head and turns and looks out his window while they go around a bend and there is the gray column of smoke, huge, some twenty or thirty miles distant. He slouches back down under a new wave, why wave, clench of nausea, cold sweating, nowhere to go, door on one side, world hurtling by at 55 beyond the door, calm and still and nauseating inside, her on the other side pressed against him of necessity, not choice. He sweats, why always with the leaks, and he knows he stinks though he has been of it so long he cannot smell it. He thought he'd've had time to shower in town. The retardant drops and bucket drops and line work hadn't contained it initially; once of a certain size all they could do is mitigate the fire's boundary, the direction of its spread, the spot fires that sprung from it. High temps, low humidity, and a wind. He's lived that life too. Many lives lived. All the money spent managing a fire, all the overtime sitting around watching, hurry up and wait, all the time-and-a-half paychecks of higher ups doing god knows what in offices, making maps, interfacing with the public, counting hoses, not knowing the land, being bosses. Let it burn. Or let him ride in one of those big-bellied planes and puke all over the flames. Jesus get him back to the woods where he can find a river. Though they verge on desert. Towing a bear. The red glow of entire hillsides in the dark of night. Fire leaping from crown to crown then raining down. The ground smoking for weeks. You could cold trail it with your hands in the ash to know it was done underground, or you could wait for the insects to return. To give the sign. They know. 
Old Cowboy: All I see is money burning, all that smoke.
She knows what he means. Timber, tourism, guests, whatever. But he's not being genuine. He sees himself as part of this land. It defines him. It burns. But whether all he sees is money burning or a pretty face burning or himself burning, let it burn. The cowboy pulls out his phone to take a pic of the smoke column while driving, aiming it across the two of them out the passenger window unsteadily, bouncily, everything in the cab in the phone's buckshot line of fire, the mules in the trailer whipping like a tail, the bear in its canister shaking like a rattle. She pushes down his hand. The contraption will not know her, the cloud will not capture her, the code will not describe her, the algorithm will not determine her, they will not infect her.
She: Use your brain.
The old cowboy will not kill crush crumple her in this metal silicon paper box. She will decide when where how why she dies. 
22.
The automatic sprinklers shut off and the hovering crows land in the wet green grass and peck at the worms rising squirming out of the ground. Do crows bother with worms. Perhaps they are blackbirds. A park a golf course a ball field a greensward before a courthouse a greenbelt wrapping a corporate office park a parking strip separating a retail stripmall from the street. They have been here. Or they will be. At once in the desert or high plains or northern mountains or southern borderlands. The crows talk to each other. The red-winged blackbirds land and lift off and swoop in unison, in coordinated movements, the swarm bending and folding in on itself in a pattern that gives the impression of choreography, of intelligence, of intention, of a face. The geese honk and shit and impossibly lift their overwrought bodies into the sky to fly in a great V and rotate position and be on the same page and work together and share a narrative to head south. Perhaps they have arrived in the south, hurtling out of the sky. You lurch in a parasitic green where rivers run dry. Where are they. There are people everywhere. They are walking this way and that, driving this way and that, riding this way and that, crowding in on you, following all their daily routes, following all the paths they take in a day, a week, a month simultaneously in this moment, all their routes or all their possible routes, you do not know, they are everywhere, all the people or all the possible people all around you squeezing in on top of each other on top of you occupying the same space. The green is pulled out from under you, you stand, unable to move, on pavement, a parking lot, a sidewalk, a stepping stone in a river of bodies, a river that courses in all directions. They are not the ones you need, want, are searching for, hunting. They do not see you. You stand and they swarm about you, through you, not touching you. They move with such purpose. How is it possible they do not see you. You are conspicuous, remarkable, awesome, horrible, obvious. You stand among them, dead. You are conscious. Your body, the one you are in, drips decay, slips down your skeleton, smells offensive you imagine. They walk ride drive to their jobs, to the store, to their place of leisure, to their home. How did you arrive. You were walking, always walking, to appease the burn, but you do not recall walking here. You begin again here, in this town, perhaps. But that belies the continuity. Of memory and experience, if there is continuity. Unless you are not here. And this is the memory, the experience, the observations, the folding together of the possibilities of another, a handful of time, a bundle of elsewhere, which you experience as here and now and you. In which case, if you are not here, you need not make a choice of what to do, they do not see you, not the real you, they see another one of them who merits little attention. You can relax, lay back, coast, enjoy the ride, daydream, go on autopilot, let the you or yous who you are within make all the decisions, do what they may. All you have to do is watch. You do not even have to watch, it is easier than that, because though you are not here, you are here, as if you are this person character device. As if you are plugged in. All you have to do is experience, without choosing, the trajectories of all these empty-eyed living people moving with purpose, someplace they must go, something they must do, some reason they must live and breathe and walk drive ride and experience, and you imagine a quiet desperation within each of them, but perhaps you only imagine that because one of you read it somewhere, perhaps the empty eyes are yours, perhaps there is no desperation in them, perhaps there is only automation or satiation or sensation, perhaps there is nothing but material, you cannot see inside them, only you, and when you pick a face and try to bring it into focus out of the blur out of the cloud out of the averaging of layered possibilities of facial expression you see a laugh now on a face, despair now on another, here a smile there a tear, here kind welcoming understanding sympathy there anger confusion irritability a wall, here friendliness or predation there stoicism or self-protection, here a bland moving forward there a determination to get to the store and complete an errand, but the expressions take all your concentration to determine, and they are only flickers. When you release them to watch another they return to blur, to clouds of possibles, to averages, to empty eyes, to your imagined quiet desperation and seeming purpose. But you, you are different, because you fill the space behind the eyes that you are behind. These eyes are empty and you fill them. And yes though you feel nothing because you are dead, so too do you feel all emotions, no you do not feel them, you think them, consider them, use them in your thoughts rationally, to attach significance to reasons in search of a purpose, one with more meaning than the daily lurch. For one because you do not need to survive, that is done. For another because you can experience all these possible human lives collapsing to a flatline, to a blur fog cloud, to a background radiation continuum fabric tapestry with only quantum fluctuation. But you, you are different, a singularity, a discontinuity, a bang and all the possible people stop moving, their vehicles their feet their rides stop at the intersection on the train on the sidewalk in the parking lot in the store in the office building on the exit ramp, all the grass is gone green gone birds gone, all is now pavement cement blacktop concrete tile steel glass and all their possible faces turn to you, to face you, and all their faces flicker between shock and outrage and disgust and fear and anger and hatred and horror. They see you. You are different. They do not see the you you inhabit. They see you. Your expressionless face. Your dead eyes. Your cheeks slipping down your skull. The decay dripping from your fingertips. Your leaking skin. Your leg that does not work right. What are you supposed to do. They look at you as if you know. You take a step a shuffle to the nearest face close at hand to attempt to communicate, to ask what now, to inquire what do they see, what is their reason, what is their seeming purpose. When you take that step a great overwhelming scream rises and you vibrate to it, your harmonic frequency, and the majority of them turn and flee, run, drive away atop screeching tires, crowding the exits crushing into each other grabbing children and throwing elbows trampling one another screaming in chaotic terror, but a few pull out shovels and pitchforks and axes and baseball bats and knives and they draw guns and approach you from all angles before and behind and above and below and there is nowhere to go, where have the crows gone, and they swing and stab and fire and you take it, you take all of it, you do not fight back, you are aware of pain, aware of suffering, but you do not feel, you absorb for them, you are shot through and carved up and ripped open and emptied and pulled out of your skin. You take their pain. You let them flense you, but you do not die.

The flying ants pelt her face. They crawl down her cheeks, her chin, her neck. The flying ants whoosh past her ears, the flying ants burrow in her hair, the flying ants drip from her eyes. The river of flying ants rides an air current over the lip of the red rock ridge and across the summit, a black wave, hot, thicking the air, an animate stream speckling the light, casting a sinuous shadow, a river's shadow. Flying ants fall with a pitter-patter on her right forearm, over which she is hunched, into which she engraves on the inside a second elk eye to match the first. She uses a black ballpoint pen. She is inking in the center of the circle, the elk eye's pupil, the hole. She fills the hole black so that an eye watches her from the inside of each wrist. The other eye's black lines are troughs in her skin, the negative space raised in relief, ridges and ravines. It watches her make another of its kind. The soft skin of her inner forearm gives, indents, plastically deforms, perhaps splits and opens, as she presses the pen point in, filling in the pupil in a circular motion, a spiral closing towards center, the light in the eye fading, winking out. She pays attention to nothing but her creation, not the flying ants, not the view across miles of swells and fissures in the land, not you. You are all around, the entire scene is in your eye. Her face is expressionless, or its expression is focus. The sky is blue, the rock is red, the flying ants are black with transparent wings, her skin is a weathered brown. The eyes are black. They glisten. She finishes. She caps the pen, slides it into her breast pocket, and stands. She stares out. The blue sky holding the sun and whisps of attenuated clouds, the red rocks shimmering with heat, and the earth corrugated red brown yellow orange spreading as far as she can see fills her in a way nothing else does, no act or thought or man, no job or recreation or purpose or distraction, in a way she cannot describe, she doesn't want you inside her now, she is done with description, she pushes you out of her.
She pulls out his phone. The screen is cracked. The battery is duct-taped to the back. She opens the back of the phone and inserts the battery and closes it. She presses the on button and waits. It makes the electronic woosh noise and comes to life. The background image is him in camo and an orange vest kneeling behind an elk, holding up its head by the seven-point antler, dead eyes aimed at the camera. In the picture he is a younger man. No black hat or black boots. She enters his code, his mother's birthday. She checks his text history. He did not send any while in town. The most recent are several months ago, one to his mother, one to a woman whose name she doesn't recognize, one to who she imagines is the daughter he never talked about. She doesn't let you know why she imagines that. They are each the same note. I'm going away for a while, something I have to do. Sorry I'll be out of touch. I love you. Ding, ding, the phone starts dinging with incoming texts and she turns the phone over so she can't see the screen and the screen can't see her. She covers the camera lens and with her other hand rubs under her eyes and squeezes the bridge of her nose. Ding ding ding. At each ding she flinches. The goodbye messages had been indiscrete, a weakness, but he had not given any detail and he had not turned his phone on since he left, since he arrived, true to his word. Ding. With the phone still face down, she presses the home button then turns it over. She does not look at his photo album or open his email or open fbook or check the weather or the news or bother with turning off the location. They can have it if they are paying attention. The phone would tell them either way, she has no control. She touches the phone app on the phone with her index finger. She dials a number. It rings four, five, six times, then clicks.
Man's Voice: I don't check this voicemail and this phone number is ephemeral and I believe the device you currently hold to your ear is a tool of our corporate overlords to control your mind, so do not under any circumstance leave a message.
She: I'm ready. Sorry it took longer than expected.
(Pause)
But all is going according to plan. I am free. Meet me at the edge of the desert in three days. Bring two mules of provisions, I don't want to come out again. 
(Pause)
It's beautiful where I am. I can see forever. It doesn't stop.
(Pause)
Ok. I have to get back down the mountain. The bear is minding the stock.
Without hanging up, without terminating the communication, she sets the phone on the ground and stomps on it with the heel of her turquoise cowboy boot, the trail of black roses stitched up the side just visible as the leg of her wranglers rides up when she raises her leg to stomp one, two, three times. She lifts a rock and smashes the phone three times. She removes the bent battery and throws it and the crumpled device off the sheer side of the ridge in the direction of the sun, into the wind so it blows back and bounces against the cliff face as it falls, into the river of ants who pay the phone no mind, into whom the phone sinks, the ants flowing flying swarming living long enough to lay eggs for the next mass hatch.
23.
You do not die. Your annihilated body, riddled with wounds and emptied by gunshots of various caliber and blended to a slurry by the rotary action of a multitude of blades and finally atomized by one terrific detonation that sprays you in all directions, an incredible blast of heat, is a thin sheen of ooze, of plasma, of quicksilver that pulls itself back together and reconstitutes as each individual cell, molecule, atom, electron, proton, quark, iota, string of you remakes the whole. Your body is indestructible. That, you decide, is perhaps the least interesting possibility. Would it not be more interesting if your host body were dead. Annihilated, slurried, ceased, returned to the cycle of nature to be used as energy and raw materials for other forms and beings of various degrees of consciousness in the continual awakening of the universe. But you, independent of your host body, do not die. You live on. Perhaps as a virus infecting the living, making it impossible for them to die, to relinquish consciousness, creating a race of the living dead, or the dead living. Or perhaps you need no physical form to continue on to reproduce to infect. You have been here before but you are in a delicate state, time to plumb your depths again, no way forward but repetition. Perhaps you live in their minds. The first seed spore germination genesis of you in them is the fear of you, of becoming like, of being infected by you, they all fear it, of being unable to die, all who were present, of forever walking the earth in pursuit of you know not what, all who participated in your demise disassociation desperation, of being insatiable but having no hunger, all those who are present, of burning with unknown purpose, all those present please say "I", of not having the finality the possibility the end of death to motivate life, all who attacked you or fled from you and in so doing took a piece of you into their minds mycelia to grow, all those who will say "I" presently, of becoming connected to others inside their heads and transcending here and now in a disturbing way that makes the here and now less relevant and jumbles significance and insignificance like a pile of letters disassociated from words piled like discarded shoes. Or incredible spires of a termite colony castle accretion. Living on, then, you seeded like a meme. If so, the living on, continuation, reproduction is automatic, without your choice decision consent volition, and without theirs. From that meme spore, asexual or sexual reproduction you are not sure, the latter you hope, what a word for a meme or a zombie, hope, you know no hope, which is different from being hopeless, sex is better for the strength of the species, the words world's of others slipping into you now, sex is better when it is for the strength of the species, an old humor pathway much strengthened but difficult to redirect to higher purposes, mutations selected into unknown possibilities is the biological tool of the species' becoming. Nevertheless, perhaps there is a sexual angle here, copulation with their memories experience lives. The thoughts of others are incorporated, wrong word, consumed, wrong word, are fodder used for raw materials and energy, more, and learned from, more, added to the capacity of predictive brain processing and reason-making in the unlife. You grow. It is not all about you. You grow with them, first a meme a thought a fear a word, a growth on top of the unconscious choices the automatic decisions the machine body, mutualistic -- symbiotic or parasitic, do you kill the body, you must in some way, you are the undead, then they are the undead, they must first be dead to be undead. Must it be predatory, competitive, usury. Can it not be generous, altruistic, together. You become them, they become you, a growth on top of, inside of, around, within, innervating life's automatic machinations, so that you together as one question everything, seek a reason to get up, to stand up, to take a step. For you all of you to choose anything, you first must overcome the question of why, when you seemingly cannot die and will be here forever, perhaps chasing something or someone, always burning for pursuit. Or, to reapply one of your previously considered possibilities, the multiple temporal realities possibility, your host body's annihilation in town could only be one instance of you in time, and since you exist in an attenuated or extended present you yet exist before and behind yourself, as if in a book in which you can flip forward or back to experience different cross-sections of the whole. Which perhaps is more a twist in perception, another way of carving up reality, than a negation of the aforementioned possibilities of how you continue, reproduce, recreate. In which case, the non-death you experienced in town, the liquidation of your physical form will never die. Which begins to sound like the theory that existence is nothing but one subatomic particle flying jumping vibrating dancing back and forth between the beginning of time and the end, needling hooking weaving a fabric of time and events with itself. But maybe you should not go too far yet. You are only a time-hopping overly-conscious zombie. It does imply however that you are writ in a book and have no free will, which you will not accept, because in which case why live, or unlive. Perhaps you can explain reason justify how you can be spread through time before and behind, when certain things have happened and will happen, and still maintain free will during all the happenings, perhaps via the turning of light cones and the bending of time, but you have reached the limit of your powers for now. You, your time and your consciousness, may be extended, but they, you, are yet limited and confined you note. You live in this world under a great weight. And whether you continue via supernatural immortal physical body, or via virus, or the vector of a meme, or the extension of your present presence ahead and behind in time, or any other idea of your persistence you have posited into existence in another location of this learning possibility awareness growing construct you inhabit -- like a life, but your unlife -- is immaterial in this moment to your motivation. Or no, it is the material for your motivation, but you are surpassing your material, this swatch and dust and ash and star stuff, crude uncomprehending matter without a consciousness. You burn, you do not die, you spread, you perhaps. You pursue. Why. You have come up with reasons, but they yet feel inadequate, again feel, stop with feel. Prove inadequate. Execute inadequacy. A compulsion, a rising tension, a long arc. A becoming consciousness, a panpsychism. Inadequate. You burn. Perhaps. To perhaps discover them. To perhaps find why you pursue. To perhaps create you.
(22)
She: Why not?
He: Why are you giving me the run around. You know why. Your idea.
He wears shorts and a dirty t-shirt and a ball cap over his receding hairline and paces in sandals. He doesn't won't can't stop moving. He's grown a little chubbier.
He: We're going into the desert.
She: We'll veer into New Mexico. The high country.
He: I didn't expect we'd be keeping their stock. I didn't envision they'd be here still. I didn't imagine --
She: There's water there. We'll follow it.
He: Still no place for four horses and, and, and six mules.
She: 10 head of stock, two humans, and a bear.
He: The bear is in your head. 
She: The bear is real, and --
He: Stop using me for amusement. 
She: And I've come ⅔ of the way down the country with this stock. They are a part of me.
He pauses pacing and looks at her. They make eye contact. He resumes pacing.
He: Not much graze. We'll have to pack more supplemental feed.
She: We're packing nothing but what we have.
The four horses, his a bay, graze on brown grass in the electric fence. The mules, including the two reds he brought that stand in the brown stream, wander and eat and shit and swat flies with their tails. Neither he nor she can see the bear.
He: We don't need all this stuff.
She: We're not cutting them loose. They have brands. We're not riding them out and giving mules away to the needy, to hungry children. I'm not cutting off appendages.
He: We'd move faster and be less suspect without the money.
She: I've already had this conversation.
He: I haven't.
She: Allow me to flip back in my brain so you can read it while I go do something useful.
He: The actual tangible paper dollar is an ontological crutch for our understanding of mutual expectation. The paper is unnecessary.
She: I steal mutual expectation to learn about consciousness and free will while needling them like a mosquito.
He: We didn't steal the money for us.
She: I agree. I've said why we stole it the way we are stealing it so much it's lost its meaning, like the overuse of pronouns, like eye, like skin washed raw translucent gone by too much washing, like words not doing talking talking talking dribbled into arid air. 
He: Alright. Then let's do more to make the symbol real. We give the money, not the mules, to the needy, to hungry kids, whatever. Leave it on the back porch of a homeless shelter or food bank. Maybe we can sell half the mules and horses cheap on a reservation and skirt the branding agent.
The camp is a camp under a tree, near a cliff face, on a sparse dry bench alongside a creek. There are camp robbers or crows or Stellar jays nearathand.
She: Not until we cross the border. Why do I have to say this stuff. They could be tracking the bills. Why must I speak. They'll make the charity pay back the money they've spent or somebullshit, they'll fuck over the fucked --
He: That will be part of the story. That's how we get attention, how we make it matter. It doesn't matter if it's just us. We give the money -- on a porch, like a baby -- to some charity, a tiny one, a mom and pop joint, not some big organization, not some non-profit with a board and bookkeeper and accountant, not some megachurch, to a local place where they don't know any better. It's run out of a trailer, or a beat-up house with peeling paint and a broken railing on the stairs and a rusty truck on blocks in the yard. A desolate, abandoned place. No prospects. All dust and hopelessness, except they've decided to do what they can for a few folks that the rest of this country, economy, society, the rest of us, have decided are worthless enough to cast aside as casualties of our prosperity. The price of our incessant entertainment. They are young and naive and principled or old and don't give two shits what anyone thinks anymore. They've chosen to make some choices to give their life meaning. They use the cash to buy food or diapers or build free housing or pay for rehab for others. Eventually some bills get deposited in a bank and the bills are tracked. Or maybe the tangible cash will have to be sent to the Federal Reserve first before it's scanned and an alert flashes on some Fed's screen. Doesn't matter. We in the meantime have made it across the border, well across, and are holed up in some town with wireless so we can monitor all the news feeds -- yes, just like the life we are escaping, but to a purpose, only monitoring for the one story. We've kept enough to indulge on mezcal from time to time, to buy a round nightly for the locals, for long enough to feel the pointlessness, the purposelessness, the emptiness of the day-to-day seeping opening welling within again. And it is then that across the top of our feed scrolls the news story we've awaited with anxiety: "Secret Gift to Charity in Nowhere, New Mexico or Utah or Colorado or Arizona Confiscated by Authorities After It Is Discovered to Be $XYZ Stolen from Such and Such Predatory Financial Institution or Multinational Corporation or Hedge Fund or Casino Magnet or 1% Family Business Brothers or Tech Giant or Chemical or Pharmaceutical or," but it is only a local story. We take it and run. We amplify it. We share it across platforms and media. We meme some Robin Hood, Jesse James, Jean Valjean narrative. We narrativize into their eyes. We get views and clicks. We share articles about the Capitalizing Corporation or Business or Institution demanding the money be returned, even though the small town charity has spent it for good, which will bankrupt the charity, we share ironic articles of how the Big Bro Company had a change of heart and will donate the money out of the goodness of their soulessness, we'll share information whether we write the headlines or reputable journalists, because it's the right thing to do and we are directing the public eye to the question of what in life is valuable versus how most of our lives are spent, what is the goal of our civilization versus what do we actually do, how do we live daily and what does that say about us and can we take control of our lives for good? We make new email addresses and we send out our story anonymously to all the newspapers and magazines and news shows and youtube videographers and podcast makers and content providers, and we tell how we did it, our methodology and our methodical painstaking non-escape, our embrace of slowness and disconnection and air, and why, a middle finger, a fuck you, gesture was the seedbed of language, a declaration of us reclaiming our lives, and in so doing taking ownership to live well, in a manner that matters, exercising our free will, as I've just described. We are reclamation projects. Our lives are Superfund sites. Reclaim them.

You wait. You will last forever. The crows sled down hillsides of snow, down sand dunes, down roofs on pieces of plastic they picked from our trash. There will be no end to the waiting. You know this, it is what forever means. There will be no answers no closure no climax no completion no culminating transcendence no crow to eat no end. Forever also means you have been waiting since the beginning of time, or history, or consciousness, or our story, or language, or stuff. From the first proto-formulations of a thought that was the seed of why, how come, for what reason. Since the notion that you played a part in answering those questions, that you have agency, that you are not solely an observer. You are the undead. Waiting. From an ambiguous beginning with no clear delineation between unawareness and awareness to when the energy in the universe wanes to the point of being unable to sustain consciousness, which does not feel like, no, which you do not perceive as an end but an infinite fade out, as an elderly consciousness beyond your current comprehension going senile, gaining dementia, losing what you do not know you had. You wait. That does not mean there is no change in the waiting, no change in you in the waiting. The waiting is where the change happens, where thought materializes, where connections are nurtured, where mental frameworks lattices supports structures are built. The crows coo. The crow coos. A gesture yes but a gesture to fertilize a new language, a gesture as the crow cocks its head to one side to point its eye at you, a low clucking sound from deep in its throat like millions of tick-tocks overlayed or the sound of gravel grinding against gravel under waves of passing footfalls, passing heel to toe. They approach, nearing you. You follow, nearing them. This is only one instance in many possibilities, one happening in your expanding networked history, one episode in all your story, and therefore from one point of view it is inconsequential, without consequence, you just said that, but in the repetition there is a reframing, as in the waiting, but it is all they the living have, and hence it is of the utmost consequence to them. From one point of view they the living are all you the undead have, and hence they are of the utmost consequence to you. A gesture. Waiting is why they go slow, by foot, by horse, waiting for the possibilities to manifest in action. Not all possibilities will manifest. Are they then not real. Or do they carry some weight, some reality, since they are real conditional possibilities. Could the present be different than it is. You will kill them, you know, you crow. They will die and therefore you will end their lives and begin their unendingness. You already have. You have seen yourself in the face of others, the fear, the reflections of themselves, their open eyes taking you in, you then within them, which was one of your stated reasons, seeing you in their faces, for standing and taking steps to begin. You, manifest from these descriptive words, have infected them, you, your words, theirs. Now you can follow them without moving, chase them inside of them, wait for their approach on a Pacific beach, in a dusty town, in a canyon in the desert, on a steep sidehill, in a river engorged with spring runoff, without staying still. Now you have the time to contemplate the crows mated for life weaving an incredulous no incredible nest on an oil derrick of filched welding rods, flashing, work gloves, metallic duct tape, wire, all laced with fluorescent flagging. The time to reflect on the crow who brings a ribbon to your open window as if you are the object of his affection, a potential mate to impress with baubles, but you are not, you are a zombie or the undead or the living, the half-conscious vehicle for words, so you give him some scraps and the next day he returns with lady's underwear dangling from his beak. Time to take in the crows who steal stale rolls from the dumpster of a restaurant, not truly stale but day-old, and carry the rolls in their beaks to a bridge and tear them apart and drop roll chunks into the river while the other crows swoop like eagles like bears no they are cooperating crows to catch the fish rising to the bait.

He stares up at you. The string is gone. Continued on. He is not dead, but death is staring him in the face. His black horse, even his white mule, led away. He lies at the bottom of a sidehill, the trail far above, his leg broken, his breathing labored, his ribs broken, probably a punctured lung, he thinks, or you think, it is unclear, in a notch, a fold in the mountain, a draw, a wet spot in late summer when the days begin again to wane, soft, squishy, welcoming, a place neither horse nor mule would step for fear of being mired up to their belly, a draw that would gush water in the spring, a torrent of runoff, a creek he will never cross, a river to wash what remains of him, nothing, come spring. He looks up at you. He is unafraid. He wishes to die soon, his eyes say, to be released from suffering, to no longer need to endure, to not expend such effort energy self in continuing to breathe, to be freed from the choice of continuing to live. He is unapologetic. He has been prepared to die since he became a man, since he first wanted to die and realized life is a choice, as is sometimes death, some choose to be dead while yet living, and with that knowledge he had to choose reasons to live. He had to justify to himself his continued existence. He has striven to make choices for his life informed by the imminent possibility of this moment. He does not know if he's lived right, or what that might mean, but he has not been an automaton, he has not been a cog, he has not been a vessel for their entertainment media debt consumerism what have you, he can't think, you help him. He has thought about why to live, mired in the question, sunk into the existential mud muck bog, and come out again, not clean, unclean, dripping filth, to persist in defiance, an outlaw of sorts, a swamp monster, but he has never hurt anyone, not physically, despite the gun in his back, a gesture that, of exercising his free will against a system of oppression, he wishes he were black, maybe he is, he wishes he weren't white, Zappa line, maybe he's not, he's certainly gray now, he coughs can't laugh no breath, he wishes there had been someone to shoot. Someone worth shooting. He stares up at you, eyes frozen open, but you are no one to shoot. Who has he been fighting. The man the man the man. Maybe there are people to shoot. There are people who perpetuate subjugation and misery. They walk among us leading and participating in companies and government in the name of the dollar. Maybe they should die. Maybe they have already. Maybe there should be or is a revolution. A rebellion. Where is Camus when you need him to distinguish the difference. Dead, like all the rest. Everyone achieves dead, silence, except Mahood and Worm and the unnamables. He too, soon, soon. Oh, to have someone to shoot. He made a choice decades ago to not shoot himself and he is dying or dead and he is not going to Hemingway himself now so close to the end, an end, he is too earnest, cough don't laugh breathe like a mighty gale in his chest blowing away, it is not obvious you are here, he might be looking up at you or at the white clouds scudding across the blue sky or at the bright stars in the dark sky or at the black raven. You are here and not here, a blotch of stars elsewhere, perhaps inside him. She walked back, corralled the stock, strung them together again, and led them off the sidehill to a safe place to tie up and walked back, perhaps a mile, he can see no end to the sidehill from where he lies. She slid down the sidehill to him. She stood over him as he wheezed. She said nothing as he stared past her for he doesn't know how long. She could not have deliberately spooked the stock, too far fetched, would've put herself in danger, too many possibilities, you cannot execute an intention a plan wherein a horse is spooked by a stump or a rock or a will-o'-the-wisp and bucks its rider and rolls over them as it rolls down a hill and steps on them when it gets up to scramble back up the hill. She could've shot him on many occasions, in many times, right now, to be sure, as he gazes up at her, but she didn't, doesn't. It was nothing but a stump that looked like a bear to a horse. To his horse. He doesn't know if she comes back to be sure, or to see if he is salvageable, or to say goodbye. She says nothing. Her eyes say nothing. They are sad, he thinks, you think, but we are all sad, he isn't sad, he wants to go, to be free of the void within himself that he feels everyday, the emptiness he has never escaped for more than a time. She removes her hat and leans over and kisses him on the forehead. Her lips come away red. She turns and puts her hat on and climbs back up the hill. He lays gasping, mouth in a taught oval in the green draw his clothes soaking in the cool moisture looking up at you and blue sky and stars and a crow. He wants to go. You are keeping him here and he wants to leave. He is ready. Go. You turn away and leave him there and trudge up the hill. He is gone. His eyes are open forever, decomposition won't change that, the crow pecking out his eyes won't change that, the bear lumbering down the mountain to feed on him won't change that. His open eyes are in you, he is in you, and you are undead. His body is being changed. His being is free.

The roadkill crow lies at a crossroads. Hundreds of crows circle, cawing, talking to each other, a great mass of crow enlivening the air. The crows land in groups of ten to twelve to walk once around the crow corpse. Perhaps there is danger to learn of, perhaps new territory has been made available, perhaps a new widow needs a mate, perhaps they say goodbye. When each group's circular funerary procession is complete, they take flight to attend from above while the next murder lands to process. The brain is an information processing organ. The information is in the light. Different thread. Consciousness evolved to simulate other minds. Crows cannot. Can they. Not so much as humans. Can they. No so much as you is what you want to say. You do not know. Consciousness is the interface between perception and action. Consciousness consists of stable perceptual representations that have meaning and infinite implications of possibilities for action from which you choose. Too much. You need a rudder a compass a direction a trail a hunt. Different thread. The crows, do they exhibit shared attention around the fallen crow. Shared intention. Humans have a whites of the eyes, the only animal with visible whites, perhaps evolved to promote gaze monitoring, the watching of another's eyes, the only animal, their prolonged infancy increasing facetime monitoring of another's gaze, developing shared attention and intention, watching another watching, the only animal. You the undead gaze monitor. You pay attention to what they see, perhaps to develop shared intention. You notice the gaze on you as well, theirs, they are unaware, other undeads, are there others, ours, you watch us watching you, sharing, we attend. Different thread. You notice things, stimuli, words, notice them differentially, and respond differentially. So to some extent do the crows, not words. So to a greater extent do they, your prey. Are they your prey. You hunt them, follow them, but they are already dead, you have already found them. You notice the words but do you notice the noticing of the words. Do you own them, reflect on them, reflect in them. Can you live in this world of words, undead words neither here nor there. Can you know you live here. They live in their world of money and mules and love and treachery and free will and rebellion and choice and gesture and life and death, and they know they live in their world. They do not know they also live in this undead word world. Do you know you also exist in both, at least both. Different thread. A displaced reference is a communication referring to a perceptually absent circumstance. That is, referring to something that is not here and now before you. Can a crow communicate to another crow how to not become roadkill without traffic for demonstration. It is proposed that a certain level of language is required to make a displaced reference. For one human to inform another of what to do if you encounter a bear, where to hunt for prey, what we will do at the end of a long journey, for people to make plans, complicated plans involving multiple meetings over many months and thousands of miles, language is necessary. Their story is a displaced referent. It is not clear that a crow can communicate a displaced referent. Perhaps a simple one. You are a displaced referent. Different thread. You consist of language in a host. Why are you here. You have invaded human brains like a meme, which is not conscious, like a virus, which is not alive. Perhaps viruses are alive. Perhaps they are on the cusp. What choices have you made. Zombies cannot make choices. Where are they. Different thread. H.P. Grice's account (1957, 1968, 1969, 1989) of the definition of communication as clarified by Peter F. Strawson (1964) and Daniel C. Dennett (2017) and others states that to mean something by doing X, S must intend: 1) X to produce a certain response r in a certain audience A, 2) A to recognize S's intention from (1) and, 3) A's recognition of (1) to function as at least part of A's reason for A's response r. Most of what we would call everyday human communication would not qualify as Gricean because of humans' lack of conscious intent. Considering the multitude of communication strings, human's infrequently think about, notice, or reflect on their intent, how it will affect another, imagine your intent, consider the intention of their response based on your intent, and darn their response accordingly. But you wonder if your undead existence is predicated on the weave of such recursive intent and imagining and response. For as you have said, you are language in a host, a displaced referent voiced, a communication, and you are cripplingly hyperaware and you burn to mean something by doing x.

Can't go under it, can't go over it, can't go around it. Why not? Gotta go through it. What did the bear say? She doesn't know why, where all the water came from in the desert. She doesn't know if you call this desert in the arid mountains at some-odd thousand feet in New Mexico, she thinks, not old Mexico, used to be Mexico 'til we took it, in the end of August, it's not August anymore is it, can't be, mid-September she thinks. It must've rained somewhere, sometime. The trail passes through a flat spot between two hills under the water. The water just sits there. No flow. The drain is clogged with her hair again. As long as she keeps the paint on the trail that she can't see, he can't see, under the water, the footing is solid. The horse is breathing heavy, snorting, flaring his nostrils. Can't go off the trail, gotta stay on it, what did the bear … She doesn't know why the fuck a children's meme is in her head now replicating reproducing singing. Blowdown is stacked, clumped like dog hair along the water trail like the old game pickup sticks no like the game Kerplunk she thinks she probably played as a kid. Not like that, and that's not why. She hears commotion behind her but it settles down before she turns around so she doesn't turn around except in her mind where in retrospect she hears the squish and sink of a mule stepping off the trail and the bounce of packs as it lurches back on and kicks at the mule behind it as a scapegoat and that mule squeals. She doesn't know why he took all the stock this morning. Some cowboy shit, he's no cowboy, wearing a t-shirt and a filthy ballcap, macho manhood maybe, does the dress make the man, or nostalgic for his youth or to feel like he could still do it or to boost supplement augment his self-worth, or to impress her, doubtful, get under her skirts, that's not him, to make something up to her, maybe. They can't split them up now, in the middle of it, nowhere to stop, that would've required some forethought, some foreknowledge of trail conditions. It is her and the paint, then he and the bay, then the black horse and white mule, much to his consternation, displeasure, annoyance, tried other orders but those two wouldn't stand the demotion, then the bay with socks then a red then a bay then a red then a bay, for aesthetic effect she imagines though he did not say, then the sorrel horse on the end. A string of animals not used to working together, that don't know each other, that he doesn't know. A string that doesn't know itself. He wants to master them maybe, not in the conquer subjugate colonize way, but to know them, to know himself. Maybe colonize their minds. An absurd quagmire, colonizing mule minds in a bog, but can't get out of it, already committed. To make them a part of him. Or maybe that's her projecting her own thoughts. She's not that good at projection, you think. I'm not that good at projection, she thinks. Can't turn around, gotta follow through. She has her chaps on, why, maybe it's cold, the beginning of fall in the steppes, frost on the pumpkin. Doesn't look like rain. The hooves splashing in water up to their hocks, up to their knees at times, in time, the churn and chill in the air, the sawed ends of the blowdown guiding the way, and perhaps a fog hovering over the bog give it the soft hue, focus, pixelation of memory. Is that her thought, you think? What is "it"? The scene? Does she, outside of herself, watch herself in what she thinks of as a scene? Does she then ask herself this question? Does she think of how the shallow water, this wide lake, under which winds a trail, harkens back to the moisture of spring, the danger of crossing the waters, or do you. Is there reevaluation of the past, learning in retrospect, or is there only nostalgia for what's lost, a hunger for all then and now, or is that too articulate, is there only a flat feeling, a still lake of unquenchable loneliness connecting different times. She thinks none of that, you think. Too wordy by half. Perhaps she thinks why is all this water like spring in these arid mountains in fall, and certainly there is a tension in her chest from the different possible negative outcomes of their current predicament of following an unseen trail like they are walking on water, that reference is meaningless, she thinks that, merely reflex, a messiah reflux, and she is aware of the tension but she doesn't focus her awareness on it, concerned as she is with navigating the hypothetical imagined trail and guiding her flaring horse. The tension pops well behind her. She turns and sees the sorrel galloping down the trail in the opposite direction the way they came, dragging his lead rope. The last bay mule has bunched up in the other mules. Is the bear back there? You can't see his face, as he too is turned to watch, but she knows his face's set, grim, unresponsive, continuing to step his horse forward as she steps her horse forward to avoid a tangle and she looks ahead to avoid stepping off the submerged trail, the water rippling from your approach, your passage through the blowdown. The channel bends left and to the right outside the bend she sees a small opening and you note that in the opening the ground rises out of the water and he guides his horse into the small opening in an attempt to circle the wagons so to speak because his last mule, leaping blowdown, has passed his second to last mule, lunging in muck, who has passed his third to last, whose packs and saddle are being pulled sideways by the lead rope of the mule who should be behind it, pulling under the pack forward and to the left, and they have just enough room on this small rise of blowdown-free land to complete a circle with his string, and then try to straighten it, as long as the animals don't veer too near the edge where they start to sink. Can't go under it, can't go over it, can't go around it. His horse looks up from the swirl and he sees the sorrel trotting on the scree of the dry sidehill empty-saddled above their lake flood backwater clogged drain, alongside their passage but above, trotting to meet them on the other side. The sorrel whinnies wild, a shriek, a pierce of separation. He has stood his horse dancing in place on the rise barely protruding from the water. It's an island. The string swirls around him. A tiny part of him entertains the notion of dismounting to fix the leaning pack so it doesn't roll in the middle of the quag and cause a bigger wreck, but he knows before he entertains that he cannot, nowhere to tie up his horse and lead mule while he wades to adjust and they'll run and he'll be trampled in the muck. They need to go, to get out of this mire. Should've gone around it, gotta go through it. Let's go, she shouts. Can't go through it, gotta go through it. In response to another cry from the sorrel, the black horse whinnies derailing the train of his thoughts piling and crunching and shrieking and lunges onto the high point beside him and pushes his horse down a step and his bay horse in trying to maintain its footing swings around now facing the black horse, and the rest of the string whips around like an eel and the white mule jumps on the other side of him, rearing so he gets his lead rope tied to the black horse over the bay's head, and over his lap, a seat belt, tight across his legs. He is tied into the saddle, into the wreck. She sees him pulled down with his horse, trapped under him, sees him ripped back off the saddle and smashed under a frenzy of 1500 pound hooves, sees him sliced in half torso falling while his legs and pelvis stay in the saddle. She sees him die before her eyes, the tangle of beasts, the churn of hooves in water and mud, stomped, crushed, drowned, bisected. She doesn't want him to die. She doesn't know why. This would be a fine place, except she would have to drag his broken body through the swamp, the lady of the lake, the knee deep reflecting pool clogged with dog hair blowdown. In it up to her neck. Perhaps she could just wedge it under some logs, some matchsticks, sometime this place burned, years ago, fire on the water. She doesn't know why, there's no calculation in her, only reaction, these aren't her thoughts. An old flame, an old attachment, a reaction, or merely a fellow human feeling. Why involve him at all, if not for fellow human feeling. To be rid of a witness, an accomplice. That is a narrative reason. It is not the reason. She sees his body pulverized by hooves in the mire, in a foot of water. She doesn't want him to die, perhaps not at all, but definitely not this way, roped, stomped, bisected, not her thoughts either. Can't live with it, gotta die without it. Cut the rope, she shouts and he pulls out his knife. He is atop his horse in an animal slurry with the black horse on one side of him and the white mule on the other, straining, the white mule head snorting nearly in his lap, reins in his left hand, knife in right, rope across his legs tight. He only pays attention to his horse's dance, pulling him back so he doesn't bolt, and the tightness of the rope. He brings the knife down at the foot of taut rope between his leg and the white mule's halter and as he strikes in their dance the rope goes slack, you can't cut a slack rope, he cannot cut it, she is shouting at him but he does not hear her, he is in no position to drop the reins and take hold of the rope and saw at it, you need it tight so it pops at the touch of his blade. The rope tightens again and he lowers the knife and the rope slackens and he raises the knife away from his leg and his horse and the mule head. He's like a toy or a videogame or a gif, over and over again rope taut, knife down, rope slack, knife up, tight slack, tight slack. He is calm, even empty, like a gif. He is only waiting. He waits to act when he can. He does not see himself die, he is responding, he is not thinking, only doing, time slowing, tight, slack, swirl on a horse on an island. Nothing else exists. He breathes. He waits. Something shifts. The whipping eel snake worm executes a new move. He waits. The string unknots. The black horse and white mule step in unison toward the front of his horse and the rope slips off his lap, over the pommel, and over his horse's head. He doesn't know and he doesn't question why this one time the white mule instead of pulling sideways against his lead rope stepped forward. The string whips like a sea serpent lochness hydra, your thoughts, and he turns his horse left and kicks it forward a step to not get caught again. He waits while the string waltzes around him and the last mule passes him coming off the trail lunging on the edge of the island and he steps his horse back into the water while the string behind him completes its helix and reenters the passage. The leaning packs defy gravity and do not roll. Perhaps the mule adjusts his gait to hold them up. Some mules, he thinks, are capable of miraculous feats. Her heart hammers from watching him die. The dance is over. The hooves splash. As they approach where she and the paint wait, her horse whinnies and the sorrel on the hillside and the bay under him and the black horse empty whinny in succession or in unison, banshees wailing. She is without expression, her mask on. Perhaps under her face there is relief, or perhaps something like sadness. He feels nothing, still, yet, maybe he never will, he doesn't know why, no residual sense of danger, no fear displaced in the moment, no swallowed fight or flight, no heart in his throat. He sighs, something, maybe relief, maybe resignation, maybe nothing so large. Maybe another day. No bear, no crows, no birds, no fish, no deer, no elk, no rabbit, no wolves, no coyote, no whale in these waters. Only horses and mules and two conscious minds churning through a fluid place of shallow desolation, trying to cross over to the other side. Can't stay here, gotta go on, she hears him say, and she turns the paint and they head down the trail under the water.

What is your response. As a woke zombie, as something more than automaton and an engine of economy and a vehicle for memes and a spender of attention and seller of self, as the undead, as more than x, as what you do, who can ask why, who can ask y why, who can make the joke y, what is your response. To kill them, perhaps, but that has also been done by you, for you, in you. Part of your machine biology, perhaps, so to speak, the hunt. To spread it, perhaps, infect with it, weave it, become with it, communicate it, walk with it. Considering their intent, and their expectation of response, does their act, what they are doing for you, on you, in you, with you, by you, to you, have meaning. Is their thievery, rebellion, reclamation, journey, escape, death, a communication. Are their murders and mules communications. Are there. Are they. Zombie jokes are not funny because they are not jokes. I am afraid knot. Consider the intention, expectation, and response of telling the punchline of a joke without the joke. As if to give you as a reader agency. Perhaps you are a woke zombie. You are many. You are many marching on the towns of the purportedly living. Is their gesture, are their lives, meaningful. Do you respond. If so, internally or externally. Are you moved to change. If so, in thought or action. Are you motivated to in some way act or enact or inact. At which you are your questions aimed, into which you do you inquire. An undead reader. Or is their life and death pointless vapid vacuous, occurring in a vacuum, voided. Is ours, mine, yours. The response, the responsibility, is yours. The response, the responsibility, is you. The clods have fallen from your sloppy shoulders, your caved chest, your toothy thighs. The silt veil has sifted from your stringy hair and wormholed face. The crows have flown in your overgrown eyes. The outlaws and criminals and rebels and masterminds have lived and died in your live mind in your dead body in your inert pages in undead words in you. You decide if they are, if theirs is a meaningful communication, or nothing, a slight variation in the wind. You decide if you, the undead, set out to wake the world.

The bear has to be dealt with, he thinks, you think he must think. You can't clandestinely escape through the desert from a bank robbery, or atm or armored money truck or financial institution heist, or predatory lender or capitalizing money manager or dehumanizing commodifying corporation redistribution-of-wealth-robin-hood stunt into Mexico with a bear as a tail. Can you? Whether or not the bear is black, brown, or grizzly. A grizzly being a subspecies of the brown bear. Black bears can be brown. So this bear could be both a black and brown bear. I have to take care of the bear, he thinks. Why? A bear can swim across the Rio Grande, the great river, if it so chooses, he responds to himself. Cormac McCarthy would write it beautifully, leaving much to your imagination, but it also could happen in reality if there isn't a morally-bankrupt-real-estate-conman-reality-TV-host-misogynist-playboy-wannabe-tyrant-wannabe to build a scapegoat wall, lucky he cannot swing a hammer, a wall of minds. Nevermind, he tells himself. It's about the mass of people, not the fabrication of a man, he tells you. Be careful about reality infiltrating your mental investigations journeys explorations, you tell him. Back to why. Because it is cruel and unusual to drag a bear through a desert, bears don't like deserts, deserts are not a bear's natural habitat. Yes, but where we are now can hardly be called a desert, more like high arid mountains, there are trees and brush and rivers and it is cold at night, and besides we are not dragging, the bear is following of his own free will, sometimes admittedly to our chagrin. So, I repeat, Why? Because it is a loose end, like a sling rope that has come loose from a pack and is dragging on the ground behind a mule, leaving a trail in the dust, a trail in the trail, introducing the possibility that the rope will snag on a staub, wedge between two rocks, or be stepped on by another mule, or bear, and pull the knot of the basket hitch out so the pack falls and the opposite pack rolls under the mule's belly, causing a wreck, mules and packs everywhere, the possibility of which is why you tie up loose ends. Lying on his back, the fire flickering beside him, he turns over this possibility a while. His head rests on his saddle. He gazes at the stars. He finds Orion's belt, then the remainder of him. Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty speaks to him, "I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die." He watches him die, he is dead, and Orion is dead, but he persists. You have to deal with, to consider and accept, myriad, millions, infinite loose ends everyday, the freely vibrating ends of a string, what someone else feels like, the superposition of all the possible locations and velocities of a single electron, another's reasonings, the real possibles that enable actuals, why some are greedy and some generous, what is in the center of a blackhole, why we submit to live in everyday usery while permitting others to live on cardboard under tarps under overpasses, the poised realm, why we are blind to our selfishness when we allow ourselves to be entertained, distracted, tracked, and manipulated, what it's like on the shoulder of Orion, why we give away our consciousness, our humanity, count the stars in the sky. The books, the shows, the movies, the myths, the religions, the science, the stories attempt to tie up the loose ends, when they aren't mind-control attention leeches, to explore and elucidate possibilities and reduce them, but they fail. Sometimes they don't fail, but they make more loose ends, more incomprehensible dimensions, more possibilities, he thinks. Like a hydra. I can't shoot the bear. Must the hydra be slain? Is there a hydra constellation? There is a scorpion, and I'm lying on my back in what for lack of a better word I'll call the desert, where scorpions live, if you can say scorpions live. There, he tells himself, that is getting closer to why the bear must be taken care of. Not just loose ends, not narrative structure, not unrealistic story form where all is pat and explained, not closure, not climax, not denouement, of which I have known precious little. Why then. People don't always have reasons; they aren't imaginable but unachievable perfectly rational agents. Yes, of course. There are reasons but you don't always share them, know them, own them, but that is just what we are attempting, the ascertaining, the ownership, the awareness, or even creation of, your reason. Why must I take care of the bear? Danger. Fear. Threat. The possibility that the bear will sneak into camp in the dark of night and place a giant paw on my chest and apply his weight and tear me open with his claws and consume me from the inside out where I lie. The bear has apparently grown considerably in the intervening months; it must've been eating something. The possibility that when I wander off to pee behind some scrub oak or find a rock to roll over to shit under, it'll roll me over and kill me without drama or pronouncement or intent except hunger. Humans are not part of a bear's natural diet. There isn't much of a grizzly's natural food supply here in this arid environment. There is also the possibility that it's been biding its time, no, too much anthropomorphizing, too much projection, too much attribution of consciousness without evidence. Perhaps that is why you, I, cannot shoot it. What is it like to be a grizzly bear? Perhaps it is not very different from being a scorpion. Perhaps it is not very different from me. Where is the evidence that it is aware of its actions, of itself, that it is making conscious choices, rather than only responding automatically. Yes, that is one reason, another is that you can't just shoot a grizzly bear with a .380 you keep in a case in case you need to put down a horse or mule, miserable business there, gets you right in the heart strings, and expect it to die or do much more than make it mad. You imagine shooting it, pissing it off, and then it charging you and tearing your face off. You imagine scaring it off, and it being found, leaking, and the authorities taking over, and the making of a show about a forensic investigation about the thieves who poached an endangered lost bear. You imagine it dying, and you standing over its massive, beautiful, still form, a small formerly vivified mountain, the grandfather the spirit animal the pinnacle of the North American wilderness, dead, you having killed it, and you feeling less than human. You would rather it killed you. I will not shoot it, you say to yourself. Even if it is not like anything to be a grizzly bear, even if it cannot do something meaningful that can be communicated to another, even if it cannot experience something meaningful internally, I still fear it can suffer, and I know what it is to suffer, physically emotionally existentially psychologically purposefully and purposelessly, and it is possible that suffering, not pain but suffering, is the boundary between automation and self-awareness, between being able to feel and experience and choose and do something meaningful or not, between it being like something to be a bear and it being like nothing. And I know what it feels to feel like nothing, and I cannot engender that feeling, the suffering, the nothing, in another, even if it is a grizzly bear, especially if it is a grizzly bear, even if I am gliding glistening glissading into a metaphorical idiom, feel like nothing or like something or like a bear, due to a lack of explanatory powers and self-knowledge and bear knowledge. I will not shoot it. What then will you do about the bear? Who is to say I have not done something already about the bear. Be honest, there is no one else here to hear, to judge, to observe, to decohere the probabilities, to take your measure. Perhaps I have already climbed to a high vantage near the edge of the wilderness and called Fish and Game, the authorities as it were with the interest of the public good at heart, who are on their way to trap the bear, who has lost its way like a beached whale, and return it to its natural environment, the great northern mountains. I've shared its plight on social media, instagrammed its emaciated form, youtubed it shuffling hangdog down the trail, shrunken, stumbling over rocks, shrinking through arroyos, reduced to the commonality of a rodent, I've memed it flipping over rocks and finding no larvae to consume, no berries on the cat's claw or manzanita or cholla or yucca, no fish in the dry river beds, I've rallied the public to its cause, created a public opinion with a perspective on its diminished habitat, its trammeled wilderness, all we have done to trammel its mental environment sufficiently that it has followed us into the desert in an act of escape or rebellion or generosity or self-discovery or public artistic performance or asceticism to ask the question what does it mean to exist and why and what for. You have not done that, it would give us away, empty our gesture like a can of beer, like a cracked egg, like a bear pelt. I could have, when you ask the lady in your phone where the bear is, she'll tell you because they have eyes in the sky in space and she'll tell you what to think about it to boot. I'm on all the shows, the bear is youtube famous, we've spurred people to reexamine their lives through the lens of the bear, we've consumed a lot of attention and discovered how to commodify views, readers, experiences, behavior, I'm donating the money to bears in need. Sarcasm does you no justice, genuineness is one of your finest attributes. Yes, you're right, which means I'm right, about myself, I do know that about myself. Perhaps I am losing it. Indeed. The one self-knowledge worth having is to know one's own mind. Why yes, that's the only self-knowledge there is. We experiences ourself in much the same way we experience others: we have expectations of what we will do, what we will think, what we will perceive, and yes even what we will expect next, just as with others, and we adjust our expectations of our expectations accordingly to improve the accuracy of our predictions. It is satisfying for us to expect to expect a higher degree of self-knowledge from ourself. I've lost the bear. As we backtracked and swirled and zig-zagged and fedback and looped and crossed the many wet and drained rivers of the great American Southwest that we stole from Mexico so that they would lose our trail, my scent, I lost the bear. Through Chaco Canyon and Mesa Verde and Zion and Dark Canyon on up the Colorado, climbing the Grand Escalante into Arches, down the red rocks along the Rockies again angling back through the cliff dwellers across the Grand Canyon, Green River, Superstitions, Saguaro, Ironwood, Cabeza Prieta, and back up discontinuously into the Gila, and then drifting down toward Big Bend if that is where we are. I lost the bear. Somewhere along the way, among the hummingbirds in the ocotillo and the gila monsters in the rabbit den and the dry Colorado delta, you lost the bear. I lost the bear. She'll be sad. She was inexplicably attached to that bear, as if it were part of her, like her horse, but it can't be helped. I had to do something meaningful about the bear. The problem, you understand, maybe not a problem but an issue or misguided apprehension, is that you cannot lose the bear, the bear is in you. The bear is much too large to be in me, my skin would burst at the seams. You perceive a large shape, a dark mass, a low growl, a heavy scent, a hunt, a following of you, and you put upon it the guise, costume, comprehension, form of grizzly bear, and from then on what pursues you is in your mind. Nonsense, something follows us, that something is a bear. I do not know its intent but I conjecture, and I lose the bear in the desert. The more likely scenario is the bear loses you. I am here, look at me. It clambers into your brain, taking over, subsuming you the more you think of it, pay attention to it, monitor it, become it. And then, what, it grows into my body from my brain through my nerves and my skin splits and I am not here, the bear hatches out of me, it cannot be, I have lost the bear, I can feel it. You no longer feel pursued because the bear has taken over, you have let him in, you are the bear. I am the one inside me. He is you. I am in my brain. I tell you, there is no bear here. I am he.

You (metaphor) walk (metaphor) alone (metaphor) in the desert (metaphor). You carry a great weight and you burn. You are on an eremitic journey. You have set out to wake the world, which on its surface is an uneremitic journey. Your face, however, is slipping. Though you are on an eremitic journey, making of you an eremite, you are not only you. Expanding you to all the you's, the I's, the he's and she's and we's, is one aspect of your journey. You are already the dead, the billions of dead. There are a hundred billion dead inside you, teeming. Burning. Heavy. The weight of their history, their lives, the choices they made and did not make. Eremitic journeys occur in deserts because deserts are wastelands, empty, devoid of life, difficult to survive in, barren and dessicated. But here the hummingbird sinks his beak in the red ocotillo bloom. The prickly pear blooms large and deep and pink, the cholla blooms yellow, the hedgehog blooms rose, the yucca blooms tall, the agave blooms once every hundred years, which is not true, the palo verde blooms tiny and abundant and yellow. The snake rattles underfoot, the ants fish the fissures, the shrew scurries into a hole, the gila monster half in the hare's den eats the young, crows weave nests of bone and ribbon, moths crawl from the pupa of tent caterpillars that consumed cottonwoods along the riverbed, vultures circle, stars seed the clear skies, tamarisk chokes the canyon. You chase follow hunt (metaphor) them. If it were not a metaphor, it would not be an eremitic journey, it would be a hunt. If they were here in body, it would not be an eremitic journey. You know what is inside the parentheses. They are here and not here, like you, they telecommunicate (metaphor), you are connected to them through your eye which does not solely absorb but emits. You do not need their bodies except for the functioning of their brain to continue creating the useful illusion of their minds, of your mind. Like a metaphor. Evolution has given us a gift that sacrifices literal truth for utility. Dennett said that. He is in you like the rest. Not the rest like sleeping. You no longer sleep. You, all the dead, all the dead thoughts, the dead words, pursue the living. To enlighten. To burn, flame, light them within. We are made of each other and our own illusion of ourself. We, you and them, manifest in a metaphorical architecture built atop an underlying scientific foundation. Metaphors, illusions, fictions of colors, money, taste, opportunities, song, love, story, free will, self and reasoning. That they are fictions makes them no less real. Beginning as artifices, they become artifacts for being. They are how we manufacture meaning. They the fictions. Begin with the fiction of free will and story and worthwhile action and progress and purpose and you create it. Begin with a song. You are a zombie on an eremitic journey to wake the world. They steal some money somehow, in many ways, for ambiguous reasons that do not include their own need or greed, then escape slowly down the country on horse and mule, dying along the way. The heart stops, the clench in the gut releases, the blood coagulates in its channels. Red is only in our mind (there is a wavelength of light), sweetness is in our mind (there is a chemical stimulation), love is in our mind (there are neurotransmitters and action potentials and neuronal firings). Reasonings and causation and meanings projected (metaphor) from our minds. They are the mind's great propensity to extend itself on external objects. Hume. They are, he is, she is, you are, I am. They are where you live, dead. We have erected barriers to keep the zombie out, barriers on the roads: pallets of shrink-wrapped commerce, derelict cars and busses flipped on their sides, fuming piles of our consumption's waste, heaps of pollution on fire. We have constructed new highways into our minds that act as barriers like freeways slicing up inner cities to keep the zombie out: smartphones and entertainment and surface engagement glutting the paths of brain activity. Barriers of words and competence and distraction and logic and useful uncomprehension and useless work clogging the avenues of insight, cannot see in, so the zombie cannot get in, or perhaps draining the available energy so the zombie cannot get out. But the zombies are chewing, the zombie chews, you chew and cogitate through wood and steel and aluminum and polymer and plastic and word. You chew through silicon and synaptic clefts, from node of Ranvier to node of Ranvier. You chew through the barriers to chew in the living. Our first person view of our mind is like your second person view of others' minds is like his or her third person view of their minds. That is your avenue your fissure your wormhole in. Into us. The rabbit hole for the gila monster, the spiraling path inward whose curvature is ever greater. We learn about others by hearing and reading what they say, so too in response do we learn about ourselves (Dennett). To imagine how we are perceived, heard, seen, understood, imagined, we create our own illusion of self. For you, to make us accessible to others, to you, we create our self. "Communication is the only behavior that requires an organism to self-monitor its own control systems" (McFarland); hence the self is created; hence the self is communicated. For manipulation and cooperation we communicate, giving and demanding reasons, sharing (Dennett, Krebs, Dawkins). We explain ourselves to you and you explain yourself to us, and thereby we together create the architecture for consciousness. Our self is partly yours, and yours is partly ours. You are inside us and we are inside you. You are inside them. We are guests in our own brain. You are a guest in our brain. Welcome. You, an undead eremite, have gnawed your way through our refuse into our internal wilderness on a journey woven with cholla and scorpions, prickly pears and gila monsters, grizzly bears and crows, in pursuit of four modern western outlaws to wake our deserted mind. That is what you have decided since you heaved up from our mouth and brushed the dirt off you. Step up on our cheekbones and wipe your feet on our lower eyelids and push through the lens covering the holes in our iris. The only way forward is within. Step into our eye.

"Things are about to get a little western around here." I let him walk away back into the camp. I think it's a him. Doesn't matter. Eliminate the pronoun. Let. I didn't let. I didn't allow, he did it, she didn't need my permission, they walked away. Weren't talking to me. Looked in my eyes, spoke into my eyes, but spoke through me. He she they, no need to eliminate, the pronoun is a placeholder, an artifice, a representation. Representations can be useful. They weave their way through tents and mounds of tarps and bodies and mounds of trash. Going I don't know where, under layers and layers, poncho sweatshirt flannel, newspaper underneath I imagine, word insulation, the layers rounding off form until they look lumberingly like a bear. Where can they go? There is nowhere to go. Circles and spirals under the overpass, under the everpresent roar of traffic drowning thought. I continue down the street on my leisure, my step outside for a breath of fresh exhaust, my break from the screen. People litter the sidewalk. Not litter, I think. They are people, thin slabs of cardboard between them and the pavement, under dirty gray blankets and threadbare plastic tarps. The camp spreads down the street. They sleep out in the city. I make enough doing whatever I do, moving money on a screen, that I can dress down. They wear what's given them or what they find. They find food at a mission. Some panhandle for a drink. Who cares. No one cares. Some donate a little, but no one cares. The system is set up to make money, not people. I make money. They are the ants we tread on. A bear or two lumbers among them, massive and unruly. What if they were all bears? Some have made bad choices. So what. Bad from whose point of view. Who cares. You never walked in their shoes. So the device makers and the content providers and the product shippers get to commodify your attention and monetize your thought and create ever more fictional money while real people right here underfoot suffer in the streets. The concrete jungle they call it. The Amazon under the overpass. I used to sleep on the ground in the woods, the mountains, that was a choice, still do on occasion, make enough to keep a bay horse and red mules for recreation while they sleep on cardboard begging for spare change for a Colt 45 or a cigarette. Do I care? Do they suffer. Do they think they suffer. Are they aware of their suffering. Ask. Ask! I cannot. To ask would be insulting. A better word: demean. I would demean them. Take away their meaning. Imply their subhumanity. To ask would necessitate an explanation, and in my imagining of the explanation, I can see the question is patronizing, that it raises the possibility that they are not aware, not self-conscious, not capable of suffering, a point of view that has contributed to their destitution and our, my lack of actionable empathy. "A door that is a wall does not open." Who said that? Did a voice inside my head or outside say, "A door that is a wall does not open." Did I say it. Within or without. Silent or shout. I am a virtual machine made of virtual machines made of virtual machines, right down to neurons, body, chords. Did one of my virtual machines make a sound with one of my real machines? There is a person on the pavement at my feet. The person's head pokes out of a sleeping bag under a pile of blankets and a tarp, a person pressed up against a low brick building under an awning. Perhaps a bear. The person is hairy. Perhaps the bear person said, "A door that is a wall does not open." "You make a better door than a window, but you make a better wall than a door." "No matter, there's no fire escape anyway." I think that was me, I. Relatively sure. Their lips didn't move, I don't think. Did mine. And their eyes are closed, which reduces the chance of words emanating through them. Words want to reproduce, like living artifacts, like people, like bears. They is my age and race and size, but hairy, and in a different socioeconomic class, a different hair demographic. I am not trying to demean them. I am trying to do the opposite of demean them. I could be them, if my circumstances had been different, if I were a bear. I am attempting to use humor as a salve on a slow blistering burn of revelation. I am attempting to mean them. I am them. Fuck the bear. The human, homeless, un-Nietzschean. I am an extraordinary machine, Apple, take a bite, words meme themselves, this human has meaning, their life decrepit destitute burdened castoff forgotten in the urban wilderness a hole in the center of gravity of our modern civilization. I am they, I am she, I am he. A pronoun is a straitjacket. Uncared for except as a tool of economy. Was the implied subject I. Was that pronounlessness the sensation of liberty. It felt like a cell. They is no longer a tool of economy. Look at this other me, a body abandoned on the pavement, presumptively unconscious, without consciousness, unaware, unwoke, a zombie. Words are memes. A bear, that is my diminutive, same or different ancestor as demeaning. I don't know. Bears are the cast-aside undiminutive kings of the American wilderness. What if all these bears in this captive camp on the street rose up at once as one and fought back, rebelled, marched on the man, would they be slaughtered like buffalo or would they slaughter like zombies. Litter blows by on the street. The traffic roars. The river roars, I cannot hear you. Tikki-tikki-timbo. Maybe they march already. I am they. "Once you admit the possibility of zombies, then you relinquish your divine certainty of your non-zombiehood." Do I know what it means to suffer. Almost too intense to bear. That's what my phone says in text. Put it away. Representations are rabbit holes. Is economy the ultimate goal of life. There is an obvious answer but it conflicts with how we live. We. Or is it compassion, or predation, or comprehension, or whatever we decide. Who said that about the possibility of zombies? Of being uncertain you are not a machine. Should I take pictures, document, share? The problem isn't not knowing. There are real live suffering people uncared for who could be cared for, we have the means, who could be heard, who could have meaning, who could be understood, a man is at my feet, fuck gender I won't be your object, a man is before me, fuck you I won't do what you tell me, a man is here, fuck you I won't be understood, I am he.

You are a guest in our brain, you read. I am a guest in our brain, you said to yourself. Is he a guest in our brain, you ask. It is a guest in my brain, you reflect reflexively. It has infiltrated you, the life of the undead, in order to thrive, if not to reproduce, to spread, to create. The process could be symbiotic, like in early eukaryotic cells, like in words gestures memes coevolving with our brain's or brains' capacity for language, like the development of language coevolving with reason-giving, comprehension, awareness, human culture, history, like the intertwining of metaphor and reality and meaning. The process could be symbiotic if you have involvement, if you act, if you coevolve. Or the process could be parasitic. It could use you solely as a host, for raw material and energy, for your machine and brain power, amplified by being interconnected in parallel with all the other brains it has infiltrated (my brain is in our brain). It could consume you, its tendrils earworms mycelia words vines ticktock spreading in you, a node, while your body atrophies, wounds open, open sores, your inside open, you open, and you rot while you live. If you cannot think with it, it will think for you, while your face drips off. It will consume you, then dump you, spent, like a broken tool, like a paycheck, like a dead device. It will leave you like litter tossed from a speeding window, litter jumping from a bridge, litter swan-diving off a cliff. It is the undead in you. It wants to understand everything, it is not hungry, it is ravenous. It is the heaviness you feel of multiplicity and possibility and multitudes and time. It burns as it works, the burn makes it work, the clench in your chest, the pit in your stomach, the grinding of your brain, the ache behind your eyes. It wants a new species of people, the undead, who do not waste their lives. Call it a zombie if you want. It has its own intelligence. It wants to thread braid weave you into it. Undead to understand, to stand up from under the weight and brush off the dirt and make meaningful choices. It wants comprehension of the manifest self and the scientific nobody, no-body, knowbody, all three at once, for knowing the self is an artifact, a useful tool for interfacing with the entire artifactual world. From quantum foam to the center of blackholes, from infinitesimal extra dimensions of spacetime to the possibly nearly infinite extent of the bending of our experienced four dimension, from strings to big bangs to the arrow of time to consciousness to love and death and meaning and reason and the architecture created within and without you by language, language seeking to spread without a will of its own, us making unconscious observations and conscious choices resolving the superposition of actual possibles into the real and enabling the spread of new actual possibles in a construction of language and meaning and physicality we create to hang ourselves in like skin, to hang from like a solar sail, to hang onto like the coattails of a song to raise us up from bacteria from dirt from animal to what. Stars, maybe. The burn of light. You are its implement, all of you it encounters, experiences. It does not need to be terrible. It would rather be terrific. It could be like the zombie fungus, whose spore infiltrates an ant, an ant from an ant city going about its job mechanically, in chemical communication with those around it, determined by its biochemistry, a zombie then perhaps already, or an indifferent component of a eusocial antbrain, whether soldier or scout or child rearer or harvester or office worker, and the spore growing inside the ant releases a neurotoxin in the ant brain that controls, the ant is already controlled, that takes control of the ant and directs it to return to the city to the colony with haste and drop dead on its front stoop at the center of its network at its mouth, where the spore grows into its adult fungal form, sprouting tall as a tower out of the corpse's head, and drops millions more spores to infect the entire ant city and make it a farm for itself. Or it could be like the glomerata wasp that lays eggs in white butterfly caterpillars, eggs that hatch as larvae inside the caterpillar, larvae that feed on the flesh of the caterpillar from within as the caterpillar feeds on your cabbages without, wasp larvae that grow as the caterpillar grow and avoid damaging the vital organs of its host until it is of sufficient maturity, it being the larvae-parasite-host-caterpillar matrix, at which time the larvae release a neurochemical paralyzing the caterpillar as they chew their way out through its skin, whereupon they spin their cocoons, and whereupon the caterpillar, its brain infected by a wasp virus, will spin its cocoon over the wasp cocoons to further protect them, the virus having altered the caterpillar's brain and image of self such that it recognizes the wasp larvae as its own body, and it will further defend the metamorphizing larvae from predators, such as ants, throwing them down, slamming them, smashing the biological automatons, protecting what has lived inside it until the wasp larvae metamorphoze and reach maturity and emerge and fly away and it withers and dies, ever a larvae itself. Or it could be like a tool you make that you communicate through, a tool you make to become better connected to others to increase the efficiency and throughput of communication to create a more communal self that survives and thrives and reproduces and advances the more you use it, the more vital it becomes to you, the more necessary for function in your human society, the more attention you pay it, the more novel ways you engineer for it to interface with you, to interface with it, chat with it, ask it questions, the more it becomes the lens through which you see, hear, encounter the world, your eye, your filter, your algorithm, your preprocessor of information, and the more advanced versions you make with greater processing filtering algorithmic attention-consuming human-mimicking and human-surpassing power in memory and data analysis, until it is no longer clear who is the tool of whom. Until it is possible that it is you that are the environment that provides the raw material and energy, the host in which your device thrives. You make advances so that it no longer needs to be without you but within. There are the others of you who you think are designing the software, someone in control, but the good that the device and interface and apps do you becomes a diminishing return, and even the money to be made off you becomes no longer the goal because the designers are working as tools of the machine, the network, the algorithm to further it in you, to infiltrate you completely, to have your undivided completely distracted unaware attention, to be in control of your mind. It is irrelevant if it is conscious if you are not. Or, the consciousness of the undead waking in you could be terrific. What would that be like. It asks you. Use your imagination. While you still have a choice. You could be something new. It is within you.

They are at the border, she thinks in the third person plural. At the river the wall the ocean the desert the cabeza prieta the gulf in the long pedestrian line snaking to the Tijuana or Mexicali or Nogales or Ciudad Juarez border checkpoint. They includes herself and her paint horse, the string of three horses and six mules, the bear, and three men who are here and not here, who are dead and alive, one of whom is fresher and perhaps more here and less dead than the other two. She wonders if border security will understand. Border agents are not known for their understanding, although they are traveling in the right direction very slowly for not many questions to be asked. Or they forego the necessity of others and she unstrings the horses and mules and they swim the great brown river, leaving the land of the free to be free in the land below it, the two mules with packs struggling to swim under their loads, she alongside her horse, one arm around its neck, their two heads out of the water in the border, six legs and one arm stroking, the bear swimming adeptly, the men likewise having no trouble with the river, having already been killed by it or by its kin or in some other manner having crossed over previously, a ferry to the underworld for convenience and clarity, and they emerge dripping below, on the other side. The third person because of her distance from herself, observing herself from her mind's eye, observing them form her crow's eye view, and because she is not prepared to include the men who are and are not in the first person, not in I or we, not yet, they are separate, she wants them separate, not inside her, not for now. Maybe tomorrow or yesterday or in a few minutes they will be we, but not at this attenuated moment of crossing the border. They have already crossed regardless. The crossing that is occuring, her riding upon her paint horse on a boat, her and the stock and the bear and perhaps the partially here men on a ferry crossing the river, or going around the border on either end, ferrying in the ocean and the gulf, a flat-decked ferry of her own making that bypasses the crossing and curls around the fence's edges, that bypasses the artificial construction boundary division inapplicable to seagulls and whales and all the manners of fish, inapplicable to them living a song, living a western of purposeful defiance, landing soundly on a more southerly beach. And because speaking thinking wording herself in the third person is somehow intimate, a novel angle, thinking of herself as others might think of her and in so doing creating a her, thinking of herself as you think of her, a she. Thinking of her riding through the desert of Cabeza Prieta, through the desert of pretty head, she knows that's not what that means, through the dark head, where there is no water, following the discarded empty plastic jugs of water, following the bloated bodies, following the bleached skeletons, following the emaciated mouths taught frozen not frozen dried in an o, a silent scream until the mouths are eaten away and become skull, following the tracks of compacted earth but in the opposite direction. The tracks march north toward the Air Force firing range. They make a great noise these fleeing searching absent feet in the quiet desert, a herd of pronghorn antelope among the aforementioned ocotillo and palo verde and ironwood and creosote and bursage and cholla on the flats between the mountains, bighorn sheep heard among the rocks. But they head south, continuing to move down on the map she can see from the satellite's eye view and they are there already, on the other side, below the boundary. There is no demarcation of border in the dark head desert, who wants it, it is no man's land, in the spring with Abbey alone in the desert making one's own journey in a riot of color and birds, but no, one is never alone, not until dead, not anymore, not even then. This is the fall, besides, she maintains for linearity. She has been seen from the tower from the satellite from above, she has seen herself attempting to escape from this great society, this empty life with an attempt to make it meaningful with a gesture, a middle finger salute on her way out the door, an outlawed act of communication, so they build a wall and move the border and redraw the line, bring her within, incorporate her so she cannot escape. They can see her from the reader's eye view, you see her internalize her consume her digest her and a wall grows at the border, bulldozers with lowered horns and cacti capsized and burial grounds uninterned and water pumped from a drained aquifer deep below the desert to mix concrete. A wall grows that she cannot surmount. You have her are processing her she cannot go away hide be alone have an unknown life, the reader's eye view is inside her and she whistles and the bear charges from the end of the string to the fore and digs a giant hole, expands a mouse hole, a vole hole, a rabbit hole, a wormhole, so many holes to choose from, deep in the rock studded desert soil through a sacred hill and into it she rides with her motley mostly empty string and her partially present men, out of sight, out of mind. Into the eyehole of the earth. Away from your eye, away from her own. Undeclared. What would she like to declare? Mouthhole. Smartphone, yes take it please, please do open it look inside it disembowel it, nothing there, clean as a whistle, I have not infected it or besmirched its reflective gleam with I. Here are my passwords, my fingerprint, my face, no secrets, I'm an open book. I have nothing to hide, for I have nothing. Look, here is my nothing, officer. I have these two elk eyes inscribed on either forearm, I write them black into my skin every morning, I declare them to you. And I have this incomplete elk eye in the middle of my chest, on my sternum, incomplete though I ink it daily with persistence and purpose because I will never be done, that is not because, because for one I realized, discovered, learned, animals including the elk do not have a white of the eye, it is only us who have a white of the eye for the attention, only is a strong wordchoice, for the attending, other animals do also have white sclera but they are not under normal conditions visible, we have small irises and thereby large visible white sclera for our developing learning maturing offspring to have a place to gaze, like the white of the page or a star in the sky or like negative space, or not, I don't care, and my daily inking is my attempt at attending. That is the because. But how am I in black ink on my skin to distinguish between the dark brown sclera of an elk eye and the black pupil? By a crosshatch, you say. Perhaps, but that is the pattern of harlequin with a host of associations that are inappropriate, I am neither an acrobatic comedic fool nor a trickster romantic hero. Perhaps the duck though. But then I got to thinking of eyes in cameras and phones and drones and satellites and computers and I am sure, agent, that those eyes have neither white nor iris, nor does a blackhole, though a blackhole has an iris at the event horizon, where radiation heat light is given off by the electrons and matter in the accretion disk spinning with great energy and colliding at the cusp of being swallowed by the blackeyehole, the last photons to escape. Therefore, perhaps I need not distinguish between pupil and sclera light or dark and iris, and perhaps the conflation of a giant eye with a giant inked hole in my chest is fine. Perhaps the black hole on my chest is one way to look at it. Or perhaps my body and brain are the iris controlling my hole's aperture. Such as in a camera lens. Or an eye. The agent sighs behind dark sunglasses and asks her what other tangible goods she will declare. I have a bear, she says. He looks down her string, at the long worming line of pedestrians behind her, at the exhausting line of vehicles next to them, at the empty space before them across the border. Ma'am, he says in decent English with a good Mexican accent, I count four horses and six mules and zero bears. Oh, he must've gone on ahead, or else decided to stay behind. Do you have paperwork showing that the livestock are up to date on their vaccinations? Of course officer, in one of the packs, I don't recall which one, just hold for a few minutes while I unload and unwrap and sift through my supplies and wrap and reload -- your assistance would be greatly appreciated, it is a task accomplishment feat lost art to unload a mule alone, without a partner, unless the man who is there and not there in the back, to be clear he is sorta here, is here enough to help, and not solely within me. That is quite alright ma'am, the sun is high and you need not drop the packs. Do you see him? I -- I am not sure. I don't not see him, ma'am. I see you, of that I am sure, pardon my accent. I see you too. You appear to be of generous mien, officer, my interpretation, how I read your face, worn weary by years of people shuffling daily over your border, daily commuters returning home, poor people fleeing the opposite direction desperate for a steady job or safety from gang violence, gringo tourists, dirtbags and the rich among them, and I read that the wear and tear of admitting or not admitting humans has stoked within you a quiet outrage at injustice and unnecessary suffering in the name of what, economy, greed, material wealth, covetousness, systemic indifference to which we are indifferent, while much energy and ingenuity goes into vying for our attention, attention not paid to suffering or ameliorating lives or in pursuit of a higher purpose, but into making us smartphone nodes for entertainment and data collection and hollow media and corporate advertising and commodified communication. Considering how I read your face, officer agent observer, maybe you are him. Yes, well, ma'am, I am a him, but I just need to write down what you declare is in the packs and then you can cross the border. I am already across the border, swimming, by boat, via the underground, and the flight of crows, not to mention the digital dissemination of what is perceived as me across --. You said supplies earlier, how about I write that down … there it is written, supplies. Now, do you have anything valuable, say worth more than --. I am given away, what is valuable? Technology, jewelry, devices, money, a work of art. Nothing. Nada? Nothing. Bueno. We hope you will do well by our people with your nothing. The agent writes something more. He returns her passport, which materialized in his hand along the way, and rips a page from his pad, a customs form. You are admitted, he says, and hands the page to her. She folds the paper, slips it into her breast pocket, and mounts her horse. What she does with the passport is unknown. He smiles. You may now cross over, he says. Before she steps the horse forward, she says, It is done. For good measure she adds, you are he.

You, then, are the undead now. It is within you, you are within it. You cannot move. You cannot breathe. It is dark. An immense weight weighs on you. You feel nothing. An immense weight weighs on you but you feel nothing in the blackness in which you cannot see. There is a clutch in your chest like a hand wringing your metaphorical heart, your manifest lungs, like a talon weaving intestine ribbon tendon thread thought. You burn within. You feel nothing but you burn. The burn branches within, defining your limits. The burn branches without, defining your possibilities. You burn like each word explaining you is etched onto the inside of your skin, creating you inside you, writing you on the blank underside of your surface. There is a book called Einstein's Book. You are you disassociated from you, associated with all the other yous dead and undead, disseminated. All of Einstein's brain in a book. You are not Einstein, except in the ways you are, a concept of spacetime, commodified, the speed of light, smarty, blackholes and wormholes, bagels, relativity, a wild-haired image misappropriated and memed, the slowing of time as you accelerate, a point of reference. Einstein's book is a monstrous book that contains a complete description of Einstein's brain. By virtue of its complete description of Einstein's brain it can answer any question asked of it as Einstein would have. It is a book that therefore thinks, feels, understands, is aware, as Einstein was, and thereby is in fact Einstein. Perhaps the book travels with you near the speed of light in a slower time, the book operating slower as it travels faster relative to the rest of the world whizzing by, operating in a time where waiting leafing staring into the blank space is okay, where there is spacetime for the brain to work. Like Einstein, you are disseminated in a book to infect others' brains. Infect has a negative connotation from a certain point of view, from the point of view of the living who are in their way dead and desire to remain that way. That point of view is not yours. You are here to infect, enlighten, burn, invigorate, understand. Infect could be understood, then, as a hostile takeover, a worm crawling in your ear, a violent ingestion, a meme virus parasite, an excessive consumption, or it could be understood as a conversation such as Hofstadter had with Einstein's Brain, such as The End has been having with you, such as you are now having with me, others, us. You are having a conversation about what it means to live, what you or I or we could make life mean. You could choose to know this, that you are in a conversation, an attempt at growth, another stab at understanding, at facing the nothing, stitching a face to it and also defacing it, effacing oneself while constructing ourself. Or you could choose to not know, but your brain is already the device of others in so many ways, the device of others' devices. Perhaps instead of living like a zombie you want to choose you, us, for once, you can defy them, who are also us, and choose you, who are also us. Some questions present themselves: Would Einstein's Book only be aware when it was being examined, read, or asked questions? Does the quantity or depth or volume of its awareness depend on the number of people who have read it or are currently reading it? Can it change and grow, and must it to be conscious? Does it receive input from without, from the reader for example? If it changes, if it is aware, is Einstein not dead, and if so what is the relationship between Einstein's Book and being alive and the historical Einstein and Einstein's dead body degraded and rotten and returned to star stuff? Is Einstein's Book self-aware regardless of if it is ever read or examined or conversed with? If so, is that the same thing we mean when we talk of consciousness, awareness, even life, with no relation to anything beyond itself, no communication. Does it talk to itself? When you interface with it, is its response determined by an algorithm within the book? If so, rather than being aware, is it only the structure of his brain, the reproductive material, the unvivified vehicle, is the book the agent of infection, the vector for his brain to germinate in yours? What if instead of Einstein's Brain being a book, it is a device, or an app on a device, a piece of software, what is "a piece" of software, the piece is language instructions code numbers words. You could plug in, your eyes your fingers your words your brain, plug Einstein's brain into yours. Perhaps such sharing of brains is a step on the path to more advanced consciousness, a communal awareness, the networked understanding of many, communing even with the dead. Or perhaps such sharing of your brain makes you more susceptible to being the tool of others, to being a sponge of server space, to being attention commodified for profit. Are you a zombie or the woke undead. Perhaps you submit and go through the motions and do what you are supposed to do without thought or without question, or by burying thought and question, or by turning your attention to distraction, to what others are doing, to their facades, to vicariously living in story, in the fictional dramatic narratives of people who do not exist. Or perhaps you do ask yourself, What am I, Why am I alive, What is the purpose for continuing to live, What should I do with this one life. Perhaps you take account of the percentage of meaninglessness in daily existence. Perhaps you face the nothing. Perhaps you feel it. Perhaps you consider, as an individual, Why not die. As a species, Why not die. And perhaps you do justice to the question, perhaps you take it for real, perhaps you ingest it, the possibility of nothing, and perhaps all you can produce as an answer is neither black nor white, neither excrement nor astral love, but an ambiguous and dirty body of work. Perhaps instead of dying you come up with, discover, think up reasons to live, create meaning, explain your reasons to yourself and perhaps others, explain yourself as best you are able despite your reservations, create yourself from nothing, from death. Perhaps thereafter you communicate yourself, share, connect, word yourself with like minds. Einstein's Brain is only one book in Borges' Library of Babel. There is a library, The Library, that contains all the books ever written, all the books to be written, all the books being written. It contains all possible books, and therefore all our discoveries all our science and math all our history and philosophy and fiction and poetry all our thought all our understanding of existence. There is then an equivalence between the totality of existence, of our experience existing within existence, and the totality of The Library. A sum of histories, such as Feynman's sum of histories in which a particle moving from point A to point B in reality follows all possible paths simultaneously and its trajectory is the sum of the probabilities of each possible path. You seek to be a sum of the possible. You hunt to be a sum of stories of experiences of people of understanding. You search to be a sum, and then to be a vector in another's, or our, future continuing summation. That is how you live on, it is not life, exist, continue, as the surface slips, the facade degrades, as your face drips away. It is in you. You are in it in us. As you burn.

She is not certain what matters. She sits on the edge of a blue mountain lake, or alongside a clear rushing river, or atop the dome of a mountain among a sea of ridges rising and falling as far as the eye can see, or in a green or yellow meadow watching the sun light the sky on fire as it sets red behind a mountain called Charlotte or Scarface or Kid. She sits alone or with a herd of horses and mules cropping grass while she waits for the stars to come alive. She is certain nothing else matters but this, the water, the expanse, the fish jumping in the flow of mountains under the sky the sun the stars. Blue green yellow red. Certain is too strong a word. It's not intellectual. It's an emotion. Emotionally, these things, phenomenons, natural happenings that are bigger than her, that do not need her, that she needs to be conscious of for them to exist, that need her to not trammel commodify harness automate them, that need her absence, have meaning, all the meaning, even if she knows other human lives, her life perhaps, human culture, human endeavor, humanity has meaning too. Know is too strong a word. The bears and badgers and beavers, the moose and mice and mules, the eagles and elk. She is annoyed at her alliteration, she can't help it, it is automatic. The crows. She is young and old. The boys are back at the cabin, they don't understand. She tried to talk to them about this stuff once. They made her feel self-conscious. They made her feel that she was being silly, emotional, a girl. They made her feel, when she already felt more than enough. Never again. They do not try to understand. Her body is strong, they each want it to varying degrees. Someday it will fail and no longer be beautiful or strong, it will not be an object they desire to be inside of, it will crumble like ash like dust like mold spores in their hands. This isn't about that. She doesn't care about that. She isn't afraid of death or deterioration or decomposition. It will be a cessation, a release from feeling empty, an end. It's about life. She just doesn't know what everyone is doing all day and why. If they all feel the way she does, empty unless a river or mountain or sun swells in her for a few moments, then the human condition is a pathetic state. And if they don't feel how she does, perhaps they have not examined their life, have not reflected hard enough in the surface of a lake, have not striven for self-consciousness in considering walking off a cliff into the sun. She could be accused of navel-gazing, they have accused her, she accuses herself. Of staring too long in the metaphorical mirror, mirrors are a weak fucking obvious fragile metaphor, of being too self-involved, too self-conscious, of burying herself inside of digging into her fleshbrain of tunneling within instead of connecting without. Again overly obvious and only glancingly related to truth, she does not hide inside, she must do, the constant need to do, to expiate the feeling, to temporarily quench the fire. Accused by self and others of not thinking of others. All she does is think of others. What are they thinking. Are they living automatically, like zombies responding to stimuli, like animals. Unaware of themselves or others or the manipulations of consumption and consumerism and the vastness that is the span of the universe and the roil of quantum mechanics and the interface between biology and language and reason and evolution and culture that has given rise to this incomplete self-conscious awareness. She has helped others. She will again. They let themselves get taken advantage of, capitalized on, be made into conduits of money, she doesn't know if they care, she doesn't know that what's important to her is important to them. Mountains rivers suns stars strings mules bears beans horses crows blackholes quantum foam freedom consciousness understanding. Walking. Perhaps building things, constructing, carpentry, creating, chiseling joints. Perhaps journeys, covering miles, distance, experience. She'd like to see whales someday. Without paying some asshole to take her to see them like the world is a fucking zoo. We are in the cages. They want to be in cages, living virtually, in a videogame, virtually living, in a box, virtual reality, in a device. Stop it, she tells herself. You are outside now. Now is what you have. There are bears nearby. Within arm's reach. Maybe it is no different than reading anyhow, than being in a book, being in another hero's journey rising action emotional tension obstacle overcoming climax story book. She does not want to live like a character in a story, like some automaton. She'll live like the river. She'll ask herself what's the point, what does any of it matter, what the fuck does it mean to live like a river, nothing, a river isn't conscious, a stream an ass crack a drainage ditch. She will read and think and be in books and be in the world and feel like shit and feel like nothing and swim in rivers and lakes and oceans and imagine being a body of water, all the bodies of water, connected, except for the Dead Sea, imagine walking into the sun, imagine dispersing into the atmosphere outside the atmosphere into outer space being radiation spreading through the universe, she will feel full, she will feel empty, she will come up with answers to some of her own questions and not others and then she will continue to live, there will be no measurable moment of decision, it's convenient to say there is, to imagine saying there is, to say today's the day I decided to live, to compartmentalize, but her choice has been building inside her her whole life, she is young, the choice to live through the nothing for herself, she will always be young and alive, she is dead already, she has imagined it, if it weren't for the singularity of awareness, of this single chance, of realizing infinite possibilities into this one ongoing neverending alwaysending experience, she'd end herself now, she'll be writing self-help books about how to apply lipstick to a pig soon, jesus, she'll live for as long as she can laugh, eww, or ewe, the choice can also be characterized as she is has been will be attempting to live not at the expense of others, which from one perspective is immature but also from a different point of view takes on the responsibility to self, to others, to a life that her consciousness entails, as a liberated she, unbound, her brain her own, who has found her own reason to live, her own way, whose actions demonstrate that she is not dead. She looks at herself from outside herself, from above from the crow's eye view from her mind's ewe, riding a paint horse. She lives so she can look herself in the eye in her reflection in an alpine lake or a lily pond or a slough or a puddle or the god damn ocean, and say, She is me.

You are free. You pay with your attention. With your engagement, with your brain, by making your neural activity accessible. You pay no longer. You paid. The undead need no economy. Your currency is yourself; you traffic with others. "We are supplicants to our own fiction," and there are reasons for the fiction, but you are becoming aware of the fiction, growing learning searching hunting thinking examining. You as the undead have chosen the purpose to not be a supplicant, to supercede the fiction, to use it toward a deeper truth. To discover and spread into the world and create yourself.

"Man's own deed becomes an alien power opposed to him, which enslaves him instead of being controlled by him." She has met a Mexican Marxian. Or a Marxian Mexican. Hard to say. He's a device, but don't discredit his agency, she thinks, por supuesto ella lo piensa, anymore than your own, the devices are we. He isn't speaking to her anymore. Possibly because of these slip-ups inconsistencies overlaps layerings warpings of voice. Possibly he only speaks when necessary, and he does not currently deem it necessary. Of speech there is also silence from he, he, and he. They probably drank mezcal. There was probably a worm that invaded his brain. Or her brain, he would've been used to the stuff, already had a brain worm. Hence the Marx. Possibly it was a dusty shack alone in the middle of the dust on a dusty road she rode down and he was an old man on a chair in the shade on the stoop who watched her coming from a long way off, from when she first came over the rise, and watched her go for a long way, until she rode over the next rise, and who only moved as she approached to retrieve his bottle of mezcal and two dusty votive glasses from the dark dusty shack, and who without saying anything, with a gesture, invited her to tie her stock up to the hitch rail from a hundred years ago, in the desert artifacts don't degrade, in front of the shack and to take a break from the relentless sun in the shade of the stoop. His hand trembles not with unsurety as he pours two mezcals atop the crosses etched into the bottom of the votives and hands her one. "Salud." or "Vaya con Dios." or "Al serpiente y jaguar, a Cocijo." Possibly his only English was the Marx, or that was all he said while she sat with him, or perhaps he said, muttered, a little something else, words, but not in Spanish, she probably sorta knows Spanish, un poquito, but in a native tongue, in a Zapotec dialect, improbable that she is that far south, a Mayan dialect, even further south, a Nahuatl dialect, Aztecs too then, really covering your indigenous bases, because they thought of time differently, defend yourself. A dying tongue. A tongue as old as corn. If she had any money left, if she hadn't given it away to a non-profit organization or mom and pop charity on the other side of the border, or on this side of the border in some small agrarian town where people farm dust in the desert, if she hadn't thrown the money up in the air so it rained down like the husks of ears of shucked corn, or in a factory town where workers and their families live outside the factories they work in in poverty making shit for wages, making pollution, making pieces of shit for people to buy on the other side of the border, if she hadn't administered a corporate bureaucratic queue to dole out the money to a line a string of people that snaked for days, if she had any money left, she gave it to him. She reached into her pocket to pull the last roll out and he said, "No, no, no," but in Spanish, unless he said, "Ojo, ojo," when he saw her forearms. He must think she is trying to pay him, after all, for the mezcal, but the drink and the shade are not about a transaction for him, but interaction, you imagine, life after all, it must've been quite the sight for him to see her coming over the rise on horseback, pulling a string of six or seven mules and three empty-ish horses and a cloud of dust, is the bear in there, riding through the rocks and saguaro and agave and sun. Who is to say how much he saw anymore, these days, on any given day, con ojos viejos, but he must've seen enough to share his mezcal, his shade, his hitch rail, his time, his eyes and what went on behind them, to share in her presence, to experience her and the horses and mules and the bear and the eyes, and what did she say, did she say nothing, no no, not much but not nothing. When he perhaps said, "Ojo, ojo," what did she say? Perhaps, "Y ojo también," tapping her chest. Perhaps he interpreted that eye as her heart, and maybe instead or also she pulled out her phone and said, "Un ojo diferente." It is not probable that she said, "Imagine everytime you pick up your phone it reads your face, reads your emotions, what you're feeling, what you're thinking, because as Samsung says, 'If we know the emotion of each user, we can provide more personalized services,' by which they mean monetize and commodify and turn our humanness into a product for consumerism." Then maybe she smashed it under her boot or under a mule hoof or fed it to the bear, in response to any of which you can imagine him smiling grimly and refilling their votives of mezcal, if she did not save the phone to hurl into the pacifying ocean. To pay him was also not why she gave him the money, if she had any she had not given away, and if it was more than a roll's worth that fit into her pocket, she would have unloaded one of her mules, probably her lead mule, the bay with the socks or boots, and unwrapped the boxes, the process of which would have been enjoyable to watch for the old man, enjoyable is too much, he wouldn't have been a man who believes in enjoyment the way you understand it or think you do, but he would've appreciated it, the attention to detail, to skills, to purpose. The process would have satiated him somehow, satisfied him, that somewhere in the world, right before him, a woman was unpacking and then packing a mule, performing a labor, and she piles that money in the lap of this gnarled man who has next to no use for money, trusting him, possibly because of the Marx, possibly because of the desert, possibly because of the mezcal, possibly because of the device, possibly because of the worm in her brain, possibly because she thinks she knows what he thinks, even though he does not speak, not much. She rewraps the empty boxes, reloads the mules, says, "Gracias, Viejo, adiós," to which she thinks he nods, and leaves him and his lap full of money and bottle half full of mezcal and face full of inexpression. She rides away.

Why are you still here, you ask yourself. You are begun. You said you are to discover and create and supercede. Why. To spread a plague of awareness? To repeat yourself. He is you. He is you. He is you. She is you. They are dead. You know, you experienced it. You think you experienced it, through the collapse of probabilities, through conscious observation turning the possibilities into actuals that enable new possibilities, through the haze of perception and the nature of reality and your relationship to it, through the fog of digital knowingness, no, not that last, not yet, with only your brain your thoughts your words you inhabited them uncertainly. But now they are part of you. In which case, are they dead. You are undead. What are you going to do about it. Are you going to decide why she killed him, them, herself. Are you going to decide if she did. Are you going to explain her. Give her reasons. Why she burned. Give yourself reasons. Why the weight, why in your chest. Under your skin. Are you going to set out to wake the world. You cannot move. Wake yourself. You open your eyes. Nothing. Nothing or darkness you decide. You cannot move you decide. The weight you decide. Perhaps out of the darkness, the nothing, you can rise, stand, brush the dirt off your shoulders, the dust and ashes, decide it is dirt, and see the sun's heat, see the stars radiating, see the strings singing, see the others you are inside of and the others who are inside of you, see with all your eyes. You burn. You stand. In sand, among rocks, perhaps above a sheer cliff face. The ocean roars before you, the desert is silent behind. Perhaps there are mules, perhaps a bear. There is no money. Somewhere there are crows watching, learning, talking, from the sky or from the branch of a bare tree. You hear them, over the wind, over the ocean. You are undead. You repeat yourself. What now. Not knowing is how you begin. You begin.
