Part One: Learning

"I am the Guardian of Life and Death. I will judge you with my scale on your life."
He heard the words while sleeping that repeated within his mind over and over. He heard the familiar yowling noise groaned and rolled over while in bed. Guard Beers nicknamed Guardian woke up from slumber from his sleep to hear his gonoid pet the bat cat dubbed Batty howling in his cage again. He got up shaking his black shoulder length hair out of his face. It was plastered to the side of his face the heat the previous night. Guardian seeing it was daylight from the window with the blinds glowing of sunlight got up from bed. He went to Batty howling away to throw a blanket over the cage that was sitting on the floor. He heard silence from the gonoid and figured that the sunlight was bothering him. He went out of the bedroom to the middle of the floor of the three roomed apartment's middle room. It was between the rooms used for kitchen and bedroom. It led to the bathroom that had a door entrance in the wall with a window to outside. He grunted out an annoyed sound to again find a round brown bumpy ball sitting on the floor. He felt annoyance take hold seeing the ball on the floor. It was from recognizing that the Spider Queen aka female spider gonoid hiding somewhere in the apartment building had deposited an egg again. He had to deposit through his eater aka fireplace in the middle room's wall. This was just to keep spiders from coming out of the egg and overrunning his home and the home of the other inhabitants in the building. He picked up the egg and threw it in his eater. He wound up waving a hand seeing the eater lit up by the motion and then went out once the egg was fully consumed. Guardian went in the middle of the room to sit down in a perfect split. He did his stretching exercises keeping himself limber. That along with swinging himself up with an acrobatic move to do combative art called Karate. He learned karate from the Egyptians living on this world of Egyptia. They had taught him as a youngster when he was being raised by a deaf woman named Verona. 
He grimaced thinking to himself "I wound up recalling my Mother raiser had an ability to flare golden eyes whenever she was angry at me. She during her life raising me habitually called me Guardian instead of any other name." 
He kept the grimace to recall "The Guardian name was kept up by my Mother raiser. That despite my attempts to use other names over the years she raised me." 
He frowned recalling "My Mother raiser passed away in some car accident. It was due to some drunk driver driving the wrong way on the highway road crashed his car into her car. I felt annoyed recalling those other cars' drivers claiming of easily avoiding the drunkard's car which killed her instantly." 
Guardian frowned recalling "Bloody Hades! The drunkard some male named Budge odd name was identified as the driver that crashed his car into my Mother raiser's car. Bloody Hades may my Mother raiser rest her soul. I recalled Budge wound up using some insanity defense during the court trial to get away with the murder. The court by three judges deciding his fate wound up agreed with the claim and issued him to take psychiatric counseling for one year instead of going to jail." 
He fumed during his Karate to recall "Budge wound up found drowned in the bottom of a lake soon after the court case was over wearing some kind of chain on his ankles attached to a concrete block. 
I call ‘The death a suicide.’ despite the police were keeping the case open instead of my attempts to close it over the cycles. 
That was due to saying various ridiculous claims of murder to my face on keeping the case open. I recalled that the police soon after Budge's death kept a habit of picking onto me as in spying onto me. This spying was still ongoing at the moment whenever I traveled outside in public in the town of Cairo." 
Guardian finished his Karate's Kata and shook his head of the memory forming a disgusted expression on his face. He went into the bathroom peeling off his shorts to shower. 
He in the shower thought to himself "I recalled fully on meeting Sally Lyons an old female. She's my neighbor that lived in the basement apartment of the four family houses, I was currently living in. My residence was the attic which I had to take two flights of ten stairs each to go up to my apartment and down back to outside. Sally, I recalled seemed to treat me with kindness. She was the one who taught me various hand motions' uses for manipulating eater places. I finding myself compelled to learn her teaching. I recalling that Ms. Lyons was the one who warned me of the Spider Queen a spider gonoid she dubbed by that name was hiding in the building. Spider Queen according to Ms. Lyons was having various eggs that needed to be deposited each time they were found, just to avoid a plague of spiders overrunning the building." 
He sighed during the shower to recall "Ms. Lyons telling me that the Spider Queen couldn't help herself with the egg depositing. It was due to instincts controlling her to do it. There were times when eggs weren't fertilized by a male spider and that the eggs were ok to be thrown in the dumpster outside." 
He continued to recall "Ms. Lyons added that the Spider Queen since taking residence in the building hasn't complained to her or the natives of them depositing her eggs. Mostly her complaints to her that someone tried to poison her out of a house which Ms. Lyons found her and gave her sanctuary in the apartment building. This talk included along with telling her that her eggs will be deposited as payment for sanctuary of living in the building." 
He showered thoroughly as he could use lukewarm water while shaking his head of the thought. That it was summer time and he didn't want to get too hot from the heat. It would overwhelm his three room apartment forcing him to spend time outside on the lawn. Mostly reading a book thrust at him from a neighbor while in the shade of another neighbor's one room apartment house underneath the awning. 
Guardian frowned thinking to himself "I wound up remembering meeting the neighbor of the one room apartment house. The neighbor was appearing to be a teenage girl. 
She had at meeting said 'I'm at the age of nineteen’ that despite her looking younger than that about sixteen. 
She also had said 'The name is Kendra.'
I found that she had wound up refusing to give up a last name despite expecting her to do it. 
She told me at meetings 'I'm a confessed bookaholic. I love to read books. I don't care what people say for reading is good for people to do.'"
"Kendra whatever her name and age" he thought while scrubbing "Was always thrusting me books to read whenever I was sitting underneath her awning to keep cool. She kept catching me trying to hide from her around the apartment building to keep cool. I kept recalling that Kendra seemed to have some sense cued towards me. It involved always finding me and wherever I was hiding around the building and its grounds."
Guardian gave up a disgust sound and finished his shower and got out to dry himself. 
He recalled "Kendra moved into the one room apartment soon after I met Ms. Lyons who introduced us. Ms Lyons wound up introducing her and me to the other neighbors in the building. The neighbors were always pulling some friendly act towards Ms. Lyons. They sort of kept to themselves around me and refusing to do any friendly behavior towards me, Bloody Hades to them."
He left the bathroom and got into underwear a pair of shorts and a tank top.
Guardian wound up recalling "The heat is going to be blasting today from listening to the radio talking about the weather. It was focused on the southern hemisphere island continent nation of Mahalia including the current city area of Cairo where I'm living at the moment." 
He sighed and went into the kitchen leaving his bedroom to prepare a meal of some food only to find an egg lying on the floor to his annoyance. He felt annoyed seeing it as always picked it up. Guardian felt no movement from inside the egg which he sensed it wasn't fertilized of spiders instead just a dead egg. He walked to the front door to yank it open along with keeping the door open by a heavy vase of fake flowers. 
Guardian recalling to his disgust "Ms. Lyons keeps on giving me various junk for my apartment I don't care for. Including the vase of fake flowers I don't want or care for. I keep the junk out of obligation towards her. She habitually manages to get up the stairs to pester me about the junk and what I was doing with it, Bloody Hades to her."
He saw the window at the top of the stairs was open and threw out the egg "I figuring out that the gonoids outside would make a meal of that thing." 
Guardian left the door open as he walked inside and got breakfast ready. It was always habitually of chicken eggs bought from the local grocery store walking distance from the house. He cooked them on the stove next to the door. He ate them from the pan once they were fully cooked not having many dishes to eat out of.
That despite thinking to himself "Why is Ms. Lyons giving me this feminine junk involving jewelry and vases of fake flowers on it instead of dishes for using to eat my meals out of? Blast her for purposely stealing my dishes or items from my apartment for me to survive on. I forced to use what I can."
He grimaced recalling "Her thievery of my dishes and personal hygiene stuff left me with not much. Such as I having only having four cups for drinking for me and three people." 
Guardian once done eating washed the pan thoroughly along with the fork then put them away. He gulped some milk from the carton in his refrigerator then he picked up his sneaker shoes and put them on without his socks out of habit along with grabbing his keys. Guardian removed the vase shutting the door and left the apartment locking the door. He wound up letting it slam shut with a bang despite feeling his mood bad. He put the keys on his waistband by hook and keychain then walked down the stairs heading outside towards Kendra's apartment. Guardian arrived to find her door open which he spotted her at the dumpster throwing out Spider Queen's egg from the looks of it. 
He sighed and thought "I figured that she found the egg I tossed out the window hence she throwing it in the dumpster." 
He went to sit in a lawn chair underneath the awning and waited as Kendra came up to him.
She, he heard speaking "Hmph Georgette must be desperate to avoid the heat. Hence she was having her eggs outside." 
He sighed again "I recalling that Kendra once told of the Spider Queen in my presence by Ms. Lyons with the same old story. Kendra has always referred the gonoid as Georgette period. That despite Ms. Lyons' repeated corrections including by the other neighbors to her who were ignored in response." 
Guardian didn't comment a response to Kendra's talk instead just sat in the chair and thumped an elbow onto the chair's arm while thrusting the fist onto his face. He wound up forming a disgusted expression on his face.
Kendra added to his disgust, ignoring his look and behavior as usual "Ms. Lyons will be along soon. It's once it's obvious that the heat is too much for her to stay in her apartment. I believe I have a book for you, Guard." 
He sighed and thought to he as Kendra went inside her apartment "Ugh better not be another romance novel involving the nation of Brittany. It's a fictionists story during the time of the Mahalia nation's continent island was discovered. I don't like being reminded of how terrible the Brittany natives treated the original manoid natives in Mahalia. That before declaring the continent underneath their Queen monarchy rule for a hundred cycles. Then some rebellion group got formed followed by a revolutionary war and then the result of that the Mahalia natives won. That got the Brittany nation's rule kicked out. Now the continent nation dubbed Mahalia is independently ruling itself with own monarchy ruler titled King. It's always King as always for passed down to males have been ruling us in peace for now." 
He stopped his thinking as Kendra came out carrying a book and tossed it to him. 
He eyed the book to read the cover to his shock mentally thinking "Why is it was on cat care?!"
He frowned wondering "Why is she was giving me this ridiculous book? That despite me having a hybrid cat bat as a pet kept caged in my apartment. The pet Batty as he was called was only let out during the night to hunt for rodents and bugs while fluttering outside. I keeping hold by a leash Batty was having some blindness and trouble telling which direction it was going while hunting. His behavior has indicated on me being blind enough to get lost and start banging into the house and into parked cars and not sparing the trees." 
Guardian frown eyeing Kendra after giving the book a quick scan, who spoke "I have someone I like you to meet so excuse me while I go get her." 
He frowned further as Kendra went inside the apartment and noticed the screen door firmly shut. He refrained from peering inside to see her come out carrying a white cat with yellow eyes. The cat he saw was appeared to have a leash on by collar that was sniffing the air firmly and looking comfortable being held in her arms. 
He eyed the cat warily as Kendra spoke "This is Whitney my cat. I recently adopted from the pound. The pound was going to put her down her staying there too long from apparent blindness which is spoken for no sight in her eyes." 
He gave a head bob in response towards Kendra who added "Hold up your hand towards her nose so she can sniff your scent." 
He obeyed finding Whitney seemed curious by the smell of his hand before some car alarm blared making the cat thrust her face onto Kendra's neck. Whitney he saw wound up appeared to be scared of the noises. He sighed to look with annoyance at a car in the lot that just arrived and already parked. He saw the driver was already out of it rooting around in the trunk. Guardian recognized the driver as a female wearing medical scrub uniform on her form as a nurse who worked a night shift at the local hospital. It was as told to him who gave up the name of Trudy omitting the last name and lived in the apartment below his. 
He thought to himself "I haven't heard any complaints from her on how noisy Batty was during the day while caged. That including along with no complaints of the Spider Queen habitually depositing eggs in her apartment likes the gonoid kept doing in my apartment and the others as well." 
Guardian made his mind blank in response to eyed Trudy's seat highlighted by the pants of scrubs while she was bent into the trunk. He eyed her who pulled out a bag appearing to be her backpack and took it out slamming the trunk loudly with a bang sound. Guardian grimaced from the noises forced himself to look down pretending to read the book as he kept an eye onto Trudy. He sensed Kendra gone from his presence with Whitney gone from noticing them both not in sight. 
Guardian continued to eye Trudy as he thought "I felt like I like her enough to be into her despite she repeatedly turning my efforts to date her squashed."
He saw Trudy jogged by him not looking in his direction instead darted inside. 
He sighed "Bloody Hades, I figured out that Trudy is really exhausted and wanted to get some sleep before her next shift time arrived. That explains her running inside instead of giving me the giggles for me sensed staring at her and forming a smirking smiley look on her face whenever I eyed her." 
He shifted to eye Kendra's apartment door lengthy while holding the book on cat care. Guardian saw Kendra come out of her apartment holding a book in hand having a cat on its picture and a bookmark stuck in it with a glare on her face. 
He heard from her "That's twice Trudy ignored my request to keep the car alarm off. Its scaring Whitney whenever she's outside. I have to bring Whitney outside for bathroom use. She's still confused on the litter box being her bathroom. That despite I keep on having to try over and over to introduce it to her repeatedly." 
Guardian spoke "Kendra-"
He was interrupted "Actually read that book, Guard, on cat care. I need the neighbors' help on knowing what to do to help me with caring for Whitney. It's in case I'm medically unable to be home caring for her. Trudy has claimed to me that she has a cat in her apartment. That has been a claim to me despite not showing that fuzzy to me whenever I request her to do it. She keeps on claiming that her cat is too shy around strangers. Humph! I think it’s spoken to avoid reading the book on cat care. I've been trying to push onto her to read."
Kendra, he saw went to sit down after giving off a loud harrumph sound.
Guardian spoke "I currently have a pet myself." 
He frowned as Kendra looked at him. 
She spoke in response "Yah I know what pet it is. Some cat bat hybrid that Ms. Lyons told me that you inherited from some police officer. He happened to be a family friend of yours who was some kind of Father figure to you actually." 
He sighed from hearing that spoke as Kendra gave him a glare "Yah it's what you said but I call my pet Batty. I haven't figured out what his original name was. The family friend and others around him are not saying the actual name to me despite asked besides Batty habitually wakes me up in the morning as some kind of alarm clock. He keeps up that wake up whenever I’m sleeping too much. He's better than an alarm clock anyway. Trudy has been whining to me of hearing my alarm clock going off while she's sleeping during the day in her apartment. Trudy hasn't complained of Batty being noisy. He's rather loud to me. I’m surprised that she's not complaining of his noises. I don't get it anyway." 
He shrugged as Kendra spoke "Actually gonoid noises are easily to tolerate whenever sleeping. It's how noisy it gets at night with those crickets chirping all over the place that sets Whitney off howling. I've gotten used to those noises after awhile of ignoring it. Whitney has managed to stop her howling at the moment. Those crickets are still chirping from time to time. They stop chirping whenever some stranger is wandering around the lawn and grounds. I know someone is visiting at night period. I know this. Because I've seen some people wandering outside the lawn underneath Luna's light from time to time whenever I peer through the window blinds."
Guardian frowned hearing Kendra's words as she added "Some of those strangers have ringed my doorbell by accident. They thinking Ms. Lyons lives here usually people claiming to be friends with her and wanting to check up on her. I have to direct them to her apartment. They were appearing to act not smart enough to know where it is. Humph."
He sighed hearing Kendra's words to think to himself "I recall Ms. Lyons had told me 'I have a private business on the side involving my psychic cards. It involved reading them to people wishing to know their money fortunes. This readings’ bit usually happened after they suddenly acquire a large amount of money and doing what it takes to keep the money intact in their possession. That despite me charging outrageous prices for the readings so keeps your mouth shut on that.'"
He sighed again as Kendra ignored his noises and went to read her book appearing to be engrossed into it. Guardian frowned to look at the cat book.
He wound up thinking "I recall Ms. Lyons told me 'I tried to introduce the psychic card ability to Kendra. It was sensing that she had some similar power abilities I sensed from you. Only to find out that the teenager was using her psychic powers for exorcisms of spirits of the dead inhibiting people and kicking them out of body possessions. Kendra was called by the local priests and police department to do that job.’ 
Ms. Lyons later told me 'The local priests and police department were the ones who paid Kendra money for living at the apartment and getting needed items for it.'" 
He opened the book and began to read it finding he familiar with some of the cat care. It was from caring for Batty who used a litter box whenever contained in his cage. Including whenever he was whining to be fed including let out of the cage for some attention. He finished the book to feel the heat hitting at the moment. He looked around to find Ms. Lyons sitting in a lawn chair next to him. She was holding a book in her hands that appeared to be some religious Bible from the looks of it. He has always seen her reading from time to time and nothing else. He sighed seeing her instead of being surprised that she snuck up onto him reading to get into the chair without him hearing her. He found Kendra gone from her chair and spotted her on the lawn holding a leash with Whitney attached sniffing the ground not looking blind to him but appearing to see. 
The cat from the looks of her was appearing to be more interested in sniffing the ground than expelling waste despite hearing from Kendra "Whitney, quit the sniffing and go you stinking cat!" 
Guardian put down the cat book on the table next to him in disgust to give off the noise. 
Guardian heard from Ms. Lyons abruptly "Whitney is partially a dog actually, despite having an appearance of a cat. I told Kendra that that’s ignoring my advice as usual. This including whenever I bring up the subject of her pet to her. Oh she wasn't lying about Trudy having a cat. Trudy does have a cat herself. That cat named Matilda can't be let outside by a claimed hearing loss. Trudy isn't kidding on Matilda being shy around people visiting the apartment. Matilda always hides herself underneath Trudy's bed whenever I stopped by to check on her at nighttime. It's whenever Trudy is out working as usual. Poor Kendra doesn't seem to get it that Trudy doesn't trust teenagers to be in Matilda's presence. Matilda was once reportedly heavy traumatized by abuse by a teenager according to Trudy. She has her mind made up that she thinks that the cat will be abused again hence she keeping Kendra away from her."
Guardian frowned to eye Ms. Lyons who looked at him and added "Besides Kendra is a bit spoiled at the moment. Only listening to what she wants to hear period. She doesn't seem to take authority figures very well. She tolerates the authority only whenever they ask her to do an exorcism. They pay her with items she requests to have for her apartment instead of giving her money for her to purchase them instead. They don't trust her to get greedy with money issues. Instead have only given her various items they think she needs for the apartment. Hence she was acquiring Whitney in the first place. Poor Kendra whether she's listening to this or not doesn't seem to care much around her. I believe that Whitney will be a good lesson on getting her to care for someone enough to start listening to people whenever they attempt to get her to listen to them." 
Guardian frowned forming it on his lips as Ms. Lyons gave up a sigh sound and continued talking "Besides those authority people have taken advantage of her exorcism powers aka psychic abilities to get people not really possessed but acting wrongly to behave properly. I've seen from various sessions to figure that out. They insisted that I come along as her legal guardian and escort. I have viewed various sessions from time to time and seen some of it. Just involves people behaving badly other than possession with her acting as an authority figure under their commands to get them to behave. They pay her with various junk in response like they were dumping Whitney onto her. The pound was going to put her down for to staying there for too long. Also I heard that people weren't willing to adopt a hybrid of a cat some status involving flaunting oneself to the public. So talk on what you experience with Kendra now."
Guardian spoke as Ms. Lyons gave him a glare "Actually my experience with Kendra only involves her thrusting various books. Some inappropriate to my taste for me to read whenever she catches me sitting here. It's from how hot it is in my apartment. I refused to get an air conditioner anyway. That that thing keeps shorting out after I hook it up in the window every time. Mechanics have claimed to find nothing wrong with the air conditioner every time I get them to check it out. Besides Batty from what I've learned from raising him seems to like the heat and hates the cold period. I don't know how Batty can withstand the heat of my apartment. The heat involves whenever it's too hot for me to be in there and too hot for a living being to be in there. He has seemed to indicate that the heat no matter how hot it’s is fine with him period." 
He frowned as Ms. Lyons spoke after he paused "Well Kendra is inside her apartment at the moment and will be inside with the air conditioner for awhile. It's hot. I'm feeling the heat which I don't mind the heat anyway. It helps to warm me up from being always cold as usual." 
Guardian spoke "Excuse me for changing the subject. Kendra has appeared to have some like of relationship feelings towards me. Hence she always is thrusting books on romance at me to read. The books' theme always involves the time of the Brittany nation finding the Mahalia nation's island continent. The theme includes the Brittany natives doing various bad things to make the natives submit to their ruler a Queen monarchy. It's a subject I hate reading despite always telling her that." 
He eyed Ms. Lyons who sighed loudly and spoke "Kendra currently has an interest on some male who's an authority figure. He's currently married to some female another authority figure who's figured out that interest. She has used her husband to get Kendra to do things as commanded whenever it involves her powers or not. Kendra unfortunately doesn't seem to get it that she's taken advantage of. I suspect that interests in the male are going away. The female he's married to is reportedly expecting their first child. She has been very manipulative in getting him to do various things for her while keeping him busy away from that poor teenager. I think she's getting interests in someone else from the way she behaves around this guy. I assure you its not you she's love struck on."
Guardian frowned as Ms. Lyons put the book down on her lap and continued talking "I believe those romance novels she thrusts onto you is her up to playing tricks again. It's her trickery way of trying to get you to find a female to be paired to."
Guardian groaned softly as Ms. Lyons kept talking ignoring his grimace forming on his face "She has reportedly gotten several single males paired up to females after some manipulating was done. This stunt was mostly via trickery. Some of those relationships don't always work out after such manipulating happened. Kendra has gotten it to her head that single males should be paired with female period. From the way I've seen her manipulating males to pair up to females including doing that to authority figures and whoever is in her presence. I think she's up to her own tricks again involving you as well."
Guardian gave up an Hmph sound as Ms. Lyons gave up a head bob before continuing "Those books you've been given are books that don't do well among the public enough to be considered trash. Hence they dumped from being bought at bookstores into reuse shops. It's how Kendra acquired them. There's a reuse shop dubbed Valley Thrift unsure of the name. Down the road opposite direction of Quickmart grocery store that Kendra frequents for buying books. That after she is paid some fixed money sum each month. She does like to read books. She doesn't have any way of getting to the nearest bookstore in another town to buy books. Her requests for own vehicle transportation have been balked repeatedly. The balking has been by various people using various excuses to her. The excuses used are all themed that the exorcism drains her enough to cause her to not function well whenever she drives. Also those people have balked on giving her various expensive stuffs whenever she requests something that seems expensive. They want her to live independently enough to get them herself. I heard that they want her to learn how to earn her own fortune enough to improve her own lifestyle. She hasn't been doing yet despite their attempts to get her into local colleges to learn a trade. This including trying to get a job and do something other than doing exorcisms which she's currently interested in doing than doing anything else at the moment." 
Guardian spoke as Ms. Lyons paused "Sounds like she's copying me in my opinion. I don't have a job or have expressed any interests in going to a local college to learn a trade to her. Or seemed interested in improving my lifestyle at the moment despite being on a fixed income myself and should be doing something else than that. I seemed to not have a purpose in life other than living like a lazy bum off the government. I despise that." 
He frowned as Ms. Lyons gave up a Tsk sound before adding "That's because she doesn't seem to get it that you’re an offspring of the current King. His first born son fathered by the current King the public not seemingly aware of your identity. I know it myself." 
He groaned hearing Ms. Lyons' words. 
Guardian looked away to stare at his lap thinking to himself "I recalling getting a letter in the mail saying 'Ms. Lyons was told of your actual identity related to the King via messenger in person. It was showing some heavy loyalty interests towards you. The loyalty is as in very strongly overheard defending you from people in town speaking various trashy rumors about you. The rumors were said about you after you became publicity known in town by the natives blabbing to each other about you living in Cairo.'
I recalled this loyalty was used onto me including the spying by the police department that was noticed by the city's natives. They refused to help me quit the spying instead encouraged it and acted as spies for the police themselves."
He spoke after hearing ahem sound from her "Thanks for the reminder Ms. Lyons. I'm sick of being reminded that the King cheated on his wife during them having a huge fight. He had sex with some unknown actress said to be some love struck female after him with marriage on her mind. My Father managed to get her to drop her attitude towards me. She wound up after the breakup expecting me secretly hiding her pregnancy from the public eye. She dumped me soon after she birthed me in secret in some midwife's home. The midwife wound up raising me as a result and passed me off as her own offspring fooling the public. She kept up the foolery till she passed away from some drunk driver crashing his car into her vehicle is when that deception came out. The press had a field day about that. They have been pestering various authority figures in the government to come out admitting that they fathered me. The King has publicity taken the Fatherly duties and claiming me as his son. The press by their blaring in media has appeared to believe a word of him doing it as a result. The press via what I hear on the radio is still pestering the government officials to admit that Fatherly duty at the moment. This despite the finger keeps pointing at the King as my Father repeatedly over and over by those government officials and him saying it. This fight is still ongoing which the public polled have been in a dead heat as always on who's my actual Father. Despite them don't know what I look like at the moment or my actual identity. The King has refused to let me be publicity known. Its known fears that I could be manipulated to want the King title duties. The King has already announced having an heir. The heir turns out to be a male child through his oldest daughter birthing a son three months ago out of wedlock through some unknown guy mating with her. Her expecting status wound up hitting as a shock to herself and the public."
He paused to clear his throat then continued talking "Besides there's a rumor going around that she was implanted through some donation. It was reportedly through some male through some kind of donation bank for that to have an heir to take over the King titled duties. That instead of going with me like people has been overheard commenting on that around town. I'm not even sure why the King is doing that instead. I heard another rumor is that his wife didn't want him to give me the King title duties. I was some kind of reminder of them having a fight. Both wound up cheating on each other and some off springs were the result of that. The Queen has acknowledged that she had a second daughter that wasn't fathered by the King but by someone else. The acknowledgment was soon after it came out that he fathered me despite some excuse of her second pregnancy turning out to be a miscarriage used. The second daughter from what I heard is living anonymously somewhere in Mahalia and could be anywhere. The Queen has like the King balked on publicity showing me or the second daughter to the public. Instead she have been flaunting their oldest daughter their only legal child the oldest of their children to produce a male child which has happened three months ago like I said. The King has declared his grandson the heir to the throne despite people commenting that I should be the heir to take over due to being the only son of him-"
He heard Ms. Lyons give off a Tsk sound interrupting him as there was a banging sound of a door. He saw Kendra come out of her apartment with Whitney leading the way. That despite leashed and looking like the cat dog hybrid was sniffing her way towards him by the beeline the gonoid was making. He groaned softly as Whitney reached his sneakered shoed foot to give it a lengthy sniff. 
Followed by Kendra he heard blaring loudly "I didn't say that you could go out and play smarty! So go to the grass and go!"
Guardian frowned as Whitney stopped sniffing him and sniffed her way to the lawn. Whitney he saw after Kendra kept blare her go command had appeared to making up her mind on where to expel waste by squatting like a dog he saw and did the deed. He eyed Kendra who ignored the mess and picked up the gonoid hauling her inside.
He heard her muttering loudly "It's too hot to do anything out there anyway."
Guardian frown further hearing Kendra's door slam shut. That along with the air conditioner unit resuming its function by the noises it made from being stuck in the window in his eyesight. He heard Ms. Lyons give off a Tsk sound. He looked at her. 
She spoke "Hmph. Kendra is beginning to realize what Whitney is. She's what I told her a hybrid of a cat and dog. It's judging by what she said to her pet's reaction towards you including ordering her to use the grass to do her business. I do think she should have picked up the mess her pet made and tossed it out in the dumpster instead of leaving it there. It's not proper for owners of such pets to do that period. Besides Henrietta will have a fit if her daughter Michaela walks into that mess. It whether by accident or not or plays with the crap out of curiosity of a three year old." 
He groaned loudly and spoke "Actually Batty habitually uses outside to do his bathroom business whenever he's let out to hunt on leash. His hunting can be for anything that can be a rodent or some insect. I haven't been vigilant on picking up the mess he makes. I've been fine with him using the litter box while he's contained in a cage in my home. He has repeatedly smacked himself into walls and things around my home whenever he's freed from the cage. It's for sessions involving bonding and playing time while inside my home depending on the weather outside. That's why I have him caged while I'm not inside the apartment. Just to keep he from causing damage to himself and the apartment's contents. Batty hasn't seemed to be complaining of being contained in the cage for too much time. That despite Trudy saying she hasn't heard many noises from him while I was out of the apartment whenever I ask her. I'm not even sure of how Batty can withstand the heat in the apartment. It's too hot for me to survive in it even if I have a blanket thrown over his cage to keep the sunlight out. I'm still confused on that at the moment. He's not so active whenever it's cold out. He's whenever its cold only uses outside to flutter around shortly before indicating on wanting to go inside by sitting on the ground and refusing to budge from his spot. I have to pick him up and carry him inside." 
He frowned to eye Ms. Lyons who spoke "Sounds to me that Batty has some kind of body system that can't take the cold very much. Hence he appearing to survive in very hot heat temperatures a normal Egyptian can't survive in without any way of cooling down." 
He sighed as Ms. Lyons checked her watch and spoke "Hmm time for me to go inside and take some medication. And check on Spider Queen if she had any eggs lying around despite repeatedly finding signs of her living in the basement's boiler room. She has been preying on the insects that get inside through the ground there. I warn you Guardian that the hot temps will cause her to lay eggs as usual all over the place. Plus the heat can trigger traveling males to seek shelter into people's homes where there's females already nesting there. To cause some hanky panky of eggs having offspring in them that must be deposited immediately. It's before the offsprings burst out and take over the place as their nesting home. Till their old enough to travel outside without any fears of being picked on by other predators." 
He sighed and without a comment got up and saw Ms. Lyons to the laundry room door entrance that led to both laundry and her basement apartment on the same floor. He yanked open the door to groan loudly. 
Guardian heard from her "Bloody Hades, wasn't fast enough!" 
Guardian frowned finding the floor was covered with too many to count white spiders that were crawling from a burst open egg sac that scattered from the sunlight pouring into the room. Some of the spiders were seen to burst into flame from the light hitting them over and over till there were a good number left out of the sunlight's glare. The spiders were seen still crawling away going up the corner walls of the laundry room. Some settling on Ms. Lyons' front doorframe's corners and appeared to be making nests from the looks of it in a fast move before becoming motionless still. 
He spoke "Bloody Hades, don't tell me those spiders are Drainer spiders. That sucked blood from gonoids including sucking them from insects. That's judging by the sunlight killing a bunch of them off and them getting out of the sunlight's light." 
He eyed Ms. Lyons who gave up an Hmph sound and wordlessly shut the laundry room's door with a slam. He was to shut the door properly by hand on the doorknob in a fast move despite some spiders in the door jamb getting crushed to death by the door. 
He heard from her "Actually Spider Queen must have mated with a spider. That is known to have Drainer offspring. A blood sucking trait they have till they get enough nourishment to grow a new body. They shed the old body and the blood sucking ability goes away. Those offsprings don't care who they suck as long as they get their nourishment to grow the new body which they'll suck manoids too. I figured if no one goes into the laundry room. It won't take long before they'll be fighting with each other. It's for their hunger will be too great to ignore which is bound to take till nightfall is when they'll be too full of blood to suck anymore. That sucking involves growing a new body that'll take a few hours of the night. Then Spider Queen will take care of kicking them out like the mama she wanting her offsprings to live elsewhere period." 
Guardian frowned but spoke "Bloody Hades, someone got to let Henrietta, Kendra and Trudy know of this situation as soon as possible. Before they venture into the laundry room and become a victim of a sucking." 
He heard from Ms. Lyons in response "Henrietta, you don't need to worry about. She's deathly afraid of spiders and won't venture into the laundry room even if she has clothes that need to be washed. She has claimed to been very vigilant on keeping spiders out of her apartment period. She has claimed to me to have littered her apartment with some bug called praying mantis unsure of the name that preys on spiders. In case Spider Queen has an egg in her apartment that hatches enough to eat the young and target the egg if it's fertilized enough to destroy it. I haven't seen anything of this in her apartment from what I've seen from her front door. Via her doorway but her apartment kind of reeks of bug spray poison very strongly. Trudy has complained to me of some stinky smell coming from the floor of her apartment. She can't seem to get rid of no matter what she uses to get the stink out."
Guardian spoke "Well who's informing Trudy and Kendra anyway?"
He heard from Ms. Lyons "I'll do Kendra while you go inform Trudy besides Trudy doesn't seem that friendly towards me whenever she is wakening up from one of her sleeping periods. That happens during the day by me informing her of a problem which can be anything. I suspect that she'll be even friendlier with you anyway. Don't ask me why so go now." 
He walked away and went to Trudy's apartment ringing the doorbell loudly to hear a cat yowling sounding faint. He stiffened of shock seeing a cat appearing to be black and white on the window still of Trudy's apartment having white spiders crawling over it. The spiders appearing to be sucking away onto the cat which made him groan. Guardian gave up another groan and figured out what to do. He quickly darted down the stairs and ran to Kendra's apartment. He met Ms. Lyons standing outside the door with Kendra looking annoyed. 
She he saw having a cell phone in her hand and appearing to be yelling onto it "I'm not kidding on what I'm saying Smarty-" 
Guardian spoke interrupting Kendra's yelling "Ms. Lyons I think Spider Queen laid an egg in Trudy's apartment that hatched. It's from seeing her cat in the window still having spiders crawling all over it that appear to be sucking it at the moment. I suspect that their sucking Trudy while she's sleeping." 
He heard from Kendra in response as if hearing him "Hurry up and get over here with your exterminator equipment! One of the neighbors just informed me that another egg hatched inside another apartment from seeing a cat in the window still having spiders all over it sucking away! I suspects that their targeting the gonoid's owner a female lying asleep inside! She works a night shift and sleeps during the day so get your seat over here now!"
He formed a frown while eyeing Kendra who hung up the cell phone by slamming two pieces together. 
The he heard her gave up to his shock "Bloody Hades to that exterminator!" 
He frowned hearing her use the Mahalian vulgarities swear words of Bloody Hades as Kendra added "Exterminator is sarcastic with believing me. He gave me a time frame of arrival which will be an hour's time frame. Just my luck it'll be two hours before he arrives."
He got thrust the cell phone by Kendra who added "Here you call emergency. See if they'll believe you enough to come over here. They attend to Trudy along with getting the exterminator to come over faster enough to take out the spiders." 
He didn't comment a response took the cell phone. He frowned as he got instructions from Kendra on how to use it to dial. He found himself easily getting her instructions. He dialed for emergency reaching an operator to his relief. Guardian found that that the female on the line seemed to take him seriously. He telling her of the situation along with omitting that the exterminator was called and sarcastic with their requests to come attend to the spiders. He frowned waiting lengthy as sirens were heard to see emergency crew come. He thrust Kendra the cell phone and showed the eater fighters' men the apartment Trudy was inside. The cat was still on the window still appearing to look weak and still having spiders on its form sucking away. 
Guardian didn't comment a response as he was ordered "Get away from the building while we go attend to get Trudy as you call her and cat out into the sunlight." 
He told them "I have a gonoid in my apartment a cat bat hybrid caged underneath a blanket. The apartment is the topmost floor of this house."
He got told "We'll check it out so leave." 
Guardian in response thrust the men his keys that snatched out of his hands. Guardian darted down the stairs hitting outside to stand with the emergency crew seemingly lengthy. Trudy he saw to his relief came out carried by a man over his shoulder along with another having her cat Matilda in hand. Both were placed onto the ground as the men removed their clothes baring themselves. He heard a Tsk sound from Ms. Lyons as the men wound up examining their naked themselves for any spiders as he saw multiple balls of eaters erupt all over them and their clothes. He kept seeing multiple balls erupt. He saw two men came out one carrying Batty looking weak in his arms' grips and saw multiple balls of eaters erupt all over the gonoid and the men. They put him on the ground him crouching while shaking. Guardian grimaced seeing the men removing their clothes to bare themselves and examining themselves for spiders with balls erupting all over the place. He frowned as he was tossed his keys which he grabbed. Guardian finding them hot to the touch and placed them on a hook on his shorts. He stood with arms folded in the sunlight feeling the heat hitting. The medics attended to Trudy and gonoids giving them all a through check for spiders. By them removing Trudy's clothes and checking her all over not were sparing her privates or her hair. They fluffing her clothes to the sunlight and seeing multiple balls on it. The clothes burst into flame. A man took and threw in the dumpster seeing an eater burn from the area. 
He eyed Ms. Lyons looking furious who spoke "That's the last straw. Spider Queen is out period. Those spiders weren't the spiders I thought actually. I just realized that they were from Spider Queen. It's why she's always hidden from me and whoever around here. It's her who's the Drainer spiders' creator. Hence she always was hiding from anyone in the building just so that they won't kick her out. Once she's seen like what's happened to others having her in their home. She overstayed her welcome having her offspring take over the building. Those spiders will stay in nesting in it for awhile till they outgrow that bloody sucking ability. It will take anywhere from a week to thirty suns before they leave for good if Spider Queen is still nesting in there. The exterminators will have to poison everything in the building and the nearest buildings near it repeatedly over and over. It's obvious that all the spiders are either killed off or out including their parents. This will take too much time and too much money. I suspect that the only cheapest thing to kill off the spiders and to get them out is to burn the building and its nearest neighbors. This while having exterminators poison the outside areas outside the nearest houses. It's just to keep spiders from gaining entrance in their escape from the fire as I refer eaters, Bloody Hades!" 
Guardian frowned as he shifted to eye Kendra's door as if drawn to see a fireman he assumed was the title come out carrying Whitney. He saw both went into the sun and saw multiple fireballs erupt on them both. 
He heard from Kendra "Bloody Hades, terrific. I'm homeless living in some crummy motel room. It's obvious till some city can get me an apartment to live in once I qualify for it." 
He frowned to eye the fireman that carried Whitney out. 
The fireman spoke loudly he heard "Found the Drainer spiders' Mother in this cat's mouth. I got her contained in the tub with the water running just to prevent her from getting out. Place is crawling of spiders all over the place. I managed to find the male's body by accidentally knocking a book off a shelf. It came out tumbling to the floor looking dead to me. I managed to squash the body flat with my foot."
Guardian heard from Kendra loudly "Great. Thanks a lot you Bloody Hades' spider for wrecking things up around here." 
He frowned to go to Batty examined by a vet on site.
Guardian spoke "I'm its owner." 
He eyed the vet who spoke towards him "Blood loss is pretty bad at the moment. I can't say if this gonoid will survive another day or not. I'm not sure if we have anything for getting its blood levels up. The gonoid is rare for this area in this state. We'll have to contact the local zoo to see if they have anything related towards it. Chances are if it survives the zoo is where it's going. A recently passed state law that involves people having adult hybrids of wild and domesticated gonoids which this gonoid qualifies according to state law."
He groaned softly as the vet continued talking "Besides there's no law against having hybrids of domesticated gonoids. There's law of people having wild adult hybrid gonoids. A zoo is where they must keep that type of gonoid period. I warn you that the state law includes a thousand currency pound fee if anyone is caught having such illegal gonoids in their residences. Lucky for you the law hasn't taken effect yet. It'll take effect at the beginning of the New Cycle. It's just to give people time to give up their gonoids and find sanctuaries willing to take them. That along with giving people time to move out of state to other states that have yet to pass such a law. I warn you that those states are currently in talks on passing such laws like what happened in our state. Other states habitually follow suit with twin laws passed soon after our state passes them." 
He groaned and spoke "I hereby give up this gonoid dubbed Batty by me to the care of you, the vet. You to do what you can for Batty along with seeing that he are placed properly in a sanctuary for his kind. I do hope no one complains of this anyway." 
He frowned eyeing the vet that held up a computer pad and pen device that spoke "Need your signature for giving up the gonoid. You're as its declared owner according to microchip detected in it labeling you as that." 
He wordlessly took the computer pad and pen and with favoring his left hand for writing attempted to sign. Guardian groaned finding his left hand refused to accept the pen as in indicated it wasn't fully healed from the arm injury.
He signed with his right hand in a messy scrawl after hearing a throat clearing noise from the vet "Guard Beers." 
Guardian frowned to himself thinking "I hate having to use that ridiculous name as my legal name." 
He wordlessly handed the vet back the computer pad and pen. The vet took them both without another comment towards him. 
He was hearing the vet ordering "Assistants! You're to take the gonoid into our vehicle! That along with doing it towards the other gonoids who obviously needed further medical help then I could provide!" 
He stood watching as Batty was hauled away along with Trudy's cat and Kendra's pet.
He hearing from Kendra loudly "I want a full report on how Whitney is doing once you can reach me as soon as possible!" 
Guardian heard nothing from the vet or assistants in response. He saw one of them drive away in their vehicle the vet and other assistants in the vehicle. Guardian stood as Ms. Lyons got a hold of his right arm and pulled him away from the buildings. To across the street where the parking lot to a bowling alley was held and forced him to sit down on the ground. He obeyed sitting crossed legged groaning loudly. 
He heard Kendra speaking "Great their going to burn the Bloody buildings. Judging from what I'm seeing them handling those Bloody Hades' grenades. Someone should contact Henrietta about this. I don't have her phone number to her work or to the daycare where her kid Michaela is at." 
He heard from Ms. Lyons "Let me handle that Kendra so hand me the cell phone now." 
He tuned out Ms. Lyons to focus onto the apartment building to see the firemen fully dressed into their clothes and uniform while holding grenades bursting of fire. They threw the grenades hitting the building all over the place from various points of firemen on their ladders and breaking the windows. They seen throwing grenades inside before retreating away from the area and parking their vehicles a good distance away as the house burst up in flame. He sat watching as the house fell apart burning to the ground leaving nothing left but ashes and spotted Kendra's house burning too. 
Guardian thought to himself "Oh what am I going to do now? What’s my purpose in life is going to be?”
He frowned as a water bottle was thrust into his hand. He felt himself thirsty gulped it slowly as he could. He focused away from the inferno to see the national registered group dubbed by the name of Samira in their twin outfits nearby him. Guardian saw that all the females were wearing shapeless blue dresses with various foot wears. Males he saw were wearing black pants and black long sleeve tops that appeared to be some loose form of covered neck top to him. They wearing twin black shoe wear appearing to be sneakers that had appeared to gather near him, Ms. Lyons and Kendra. The Samira group members handing out nourishment to all three of them, he and the females wordlessly took eating and drinking himself finding that he was hungry. 
He recalled as he thought to himself while chewing and drinking the nourishment "The Samira group is an actual religious cult of some private not publicized religion whatever it is. I would love to find out anyway. Oh they earned the official name of Samira by a King of Mahalia. The King back then was recognizing the group for helping out people in disasters regardless of how bad it was. The disasters were reportedly happening all over the Mahalia nation and its allied islands. Some isles underneath Mahalia's King rule. Some were ruled by their own rulers carrying the titles of Duke or Duchess passed down in the family and answering to the King period." 
He ate the food and drinks cutting his thought and handed back the bottles and wrappings towards a Samira member. 
He resumed sitting on the ground thinking to himself "I wonder what I'm to go next including what purpose in my life I was to do?" 
Guardian recalled to himself thinking "I recalled that the King after a private meeting with me soon after the death of my Mother raiser ordered me 'You're to go to West Allied state and stay there. You're to keep yourself out of the public eye and not flaunt yourself as my son. I have oath that I would provide you with a place to stay along with a fixed income monthly money allowance per month for you to live on for a certain time period.'"
He wound up recalling on reading a newspaper's headline as left taped to his door with article cut out. 
Only the headline was left onto his door it said "King's son would be awarded a huge money sum after the time period was up to keep himself anonymous." 
He sighed "I wound up recalling that the King ordered me 'Your not to contact me and my family for anything period. Unless a postcard from Elizabethan Island nation an ocean island allied territory of where my secret private island was arrived mailed to you with wording indicating on contact. It was when you could do the contact in anyway you could.'"
Guardian remained sitting for a long time feeling the heat hitting him as he shook his head of the memory flashing in his mind. 
Ms. Lyons' loud voice broke his thoughts "His name is Guard Beers. He's a loner around here who lives in the attic floor of the house apartment building. He's been living there as long as I've lived in the basement apartment which is five cycles. He was an employee of a factory company named Trick Party or TP. I used to work there before retiring. I'm not even sure of why he's not working at the moment that despite me hearing all sorts or rumors from contacts of the company. He doesn't seem to indicate towards me of having any family living nearby or indicate anything related to his family or why he's living there. Sorry I don't know much more about him. Except he had a hybrid bat cat as a pet he had to give up some state law that said something about wild and domesticated hybrid gonoids being kept as pets."
Guardian shifted to focus towards Ms. Lyons talking to a Samira female that had a computer pad in her hand. The Samira female appeared to one hand typing it.
He continued to overhear Ms. Lyons add "That girl who gave up the name of Kendra Star's actual name is Sydney Simons. She's a reported local exorcist for getting spirits of the dead to get out of possessing the living. She has been used by various local religious groups' leaders including the law for doing exorcisms onto people. Mostly behaving like their possessed by some bad spirit of the dead. They currently pay for her situation of living a dwelling, getting nourishment and items she needs to survive in a dwelling. She's currently on a fixed monthly income. She spends the money on items mostly books from the local reuse shop, Valley Thrift walking distance from here. It's about a five minutes' walk via main road avoiding traffic. She's a reported bookaholic and likes to read. She has been trying to pass off that reading habit onto the other inhabitants of the building. She currently has as a pet a white cat dog hybrid that is more like a cat by appearance but reportedly blind according to her. She lived in the cabin soon after the landlord Jack as he's known fixed it up for living. That was after using it as storage shed for too much time."
He frowned to get up from the ground and went to Ms. Lyons who noticed his arrival.
She heard speaking "This is Elise who's taking records for disaster relief for the victims. I already told her what I knew of you, Trudy, Henrietta and Kendra. It's from her asking me so tell her what she wants to know. Excuse me while I go ask for a proper seat I'm quite weary." 
Guardian watched her walk off going up to a male Samira and appeared to be in a whispered conversation with him. He frowned to eye them before seeing them both going inside the bowling alley building.
He focused onto Elise he assumed was the female's name who spoke "So tell me about yourself and what you knew of the neighbors." 
Guardian sighed softly and spoke as Elise's left hand flew on the computer pad "The name's Guard Beers. I'm actually an orphan some well known official in the government unknown to me sponsored all my life for helping me get various items I need. This while living as a youngster before reaching legal age of nineteen, while underneath various females in foster homes. One of them admitted this sponsorship. Something that is common among government officials to do towards kids who are orphans with no known family to raise them hence the sponsorship."
He frowned thinking to himself "I hate having to lie about my background as drilled to me by my Father wanting me to keep myself anonymous." 
Elise he heard broke his thinking spoke "Job you have at the moment?"
He spoke from seeing a red visible jagged scar line on his left forearm he unable to remove that scar's marking "I currently don't have a job at the moment. I don't have the proper schooling for the jobs I want to live a lifestyle. I was laid off from a packaging company factory job downsizing its company two lunar cycled months ago. They gave me a retirement pension for the laid off me getting injured during a spinner storm hitting the factory area. I wound up being the first in line to warn the factory workers of a spinner's coming. I warning the factory and people was from being outside smoking a cigarette which I quit the habit. I saw the spinner storm's arrival ran inside and told everybody to take shelter they didn't believe me at first. They believed me when a police officer's car smashed into the factory's entrance reportedly killing the cop inside that caused a horrible noise. Every ones of the employees except one had managed to get to safety and survived the disaster but the building suffered too much damage to be fixed and had to be torn down. I wound up breaking my left arm during the disaster of trying to help the President's son survive the disaster. That while contained in a private room for men during the spinner hitting the building. He was unable to get to the storm shelter on time. I went to look for him while noticing him missing from the shelter. I found him in the male's bathroom and helped keep him alive with the spinner storming the building. The left arm has a scar at the moment I'm unable to remove. The left arm's bone broke because I was lying on top of the son. I was shielding him from the debris falling from the sky from the roof ripping open. One of the debris slammed onto my arm very hard breaking the bone before getting off of me by the spinner's winds whipping around. I used a handheld onto a sink's faucet to hold myself and an arm around the son from being flown out by the winds. The spinner managed to go by and we both survived intact. I got laid off as a result of my heroism but was given a small pension. I currently live on but it's not much for me to live very comfortably." 
He frowned to eye Elise who spoke "Would this factory be the Trick Party or TP factory?"
Guardian groaned and spoke "Yes that's the factory where I used to work before I was laid off. My pension money I earned from the factory is simply five hundred and twenty seven pounds a month. I'm currently receiving at the moment till I qualify for social security at the age of sixty five. I'm currently twenty six. TP were currently paying most of my rent three hundred and twenty five pounds. The rest was paid by me totaling five hundred pounds per month in rent money in the apartment I was currently living in." 
He frowned as Elise spoke "The pet someone said you had some bat cat hybrid? How did you acquire it?"
Guardian sighed again and spoke "It was through inheritance from some police officer's passing away reportedly belonged to the officer whose car smashed into the factory's building. His family wound up claiming that he was a family friend of my parents from grade school. I was tracked down and given the bat cat hybrid I dubbed Batty not told his original name. I had Batty for two lunar cycled months before giving him up today. The vet telling me that the state passed a state law involving keeping gonoid hybrids like Batty as pets. This law making it illegal for that to happening which I signed over Batty to the vet." 
He frown eyeing Elise who continued to type on her computer pad then she spoke "Tell me what you know of your neighbors that lived with you in the building and the neighbor in the cabin?"
He spoke "I know about Kendra is from what she tells me. I heard Ms. Lyons tell you that her name is Sydney Simons is from what I overheard. I wound up overhearing Ms. Sally Lyons telling you about her. What I knew of her is what Ms. Lyons said."
Guardian frowned as Elise spoke "Anything on Ms. Lyons and the other inhabitants?"
He spoke "Ms. Lyons from what I know of her used to work at TP as I did. She retired from there during my four Egyptia's planetary world around the sun's trip cycles of working. She has been my neighbor as long as I lived in the apartment building. She appearing to currently living on a retiree pension from either the company or the state government I'm not sure which. Anyway the other neighbors I know that lived in the building were a woman named Trudy. I'm not given her last name that worked in some hospital as a nurse during Luna's time and slept during the sunlight who currently owns her own vehicle and a cat. The other neighbors are another woman named Henrietta Anita. That's the name she gave me and her three year old daughter Michaela Anita who moved into the apartment building after days of birthing her as claimed to me. I heard from Ms. Lyons that Henrietta admitted that she got out of a marriage with a male not named. The male according to Ms. Lyons wound using Henrietta's connections as a lawyer to further his lawyer career. The ex-husband hit her with divorce once his career was established. That along with getting out of paying her child support payments once it was obvious she was carrying his child. The excuse I heard to get out of paying her child support was that the child was created for her to gain his money wealth which the judge sided with him. The judge according to Ms. Lyons seemed to side with him on who should pay alimony money. She's currently paying him. The judge saying from what I learned that she was using her child as an excuse to get money amounts from her ex-husband hence she should pay as a result. I haven't heard on the amount of money she's currently paying at the moment. I heard that she currently works two jobs one as a lawyer handling defendants. They unable to afford a lawyer while their accused of crimes police have them arrested for the city of Georgina the state's capital. That happens and working part time at TP who hired her for secretary work. I don't know if their paying for her rent or not." 
He clamped his mouth shut once done to eye Elise who kept typing then paused to look at him.
She spoke "Do you still keep contact with the government official that sponsored you?"
He spoke "Sorry no. The sponsorship ended once I reached the legal age of nineteen with no knowledge of who sponsored me said to me yet. I wound up getting the job at TP. The hiring was before Mahalia Day's holiday week at age twenty. It happened after a cycle of unsuccessful attempts to get a job. I not qualified for various jobs and not having the proper schooling for getting the jobs I needed to have a lifestyle that involves working in an office."
Guardian again clamped his mouth shut as Elise kept typing then looked at him and spoke "Your school history please?"
He sighed and spoke "I was home schooled for most of my offspring life by various tutors till my current Mother raiser passed away when I was age seventeen. I wound up going to high school for two cycles. I wasn't able to qualify for a diploma. My schooling level was said to be lower than their standards as claimed to me. Despite me getting various high grades and scoring high on tests. I was kicked out once I turned nineteen or declared that age by the high school saying it to me. It was on claims that I was too old for high school and should be in college instead. I haven't been able to get into any diploma like programs at local colleges offered around the state. It's from not qualifying for scholarships offered for students to have paid for attending the local college. I don't currently earn enough money for diploma's college classes. I have been trying unsuccessfully to qualify for scholarships since I was laid off from working at Trick as it's dubbed and not TP. Also during my time of working at Trick while living in the apartment building with the company paying most of the rent is when I would take one night class. Mostly during Western Community College's semesters of whenever they offered classes involved with getting a diploma only at night. So far I have competed three of the required Western Community College's five classes over a three cycled period for getting a diploma offered at night. I haven't been able to get the other two classes at night. The college abruptly dropped having night classes for people to get diplomas. The college has been focused onto doing it during the day without any reason for doing that switchover. I heard a rumor from college students in my presence around town that switchover was because of some female student claimed to be pregnant by force in her car. The rumor says this pregnancy bit happened at night by some guy getting inside her vehicle after she got inside and forced her into a mating ritual. She wound up pregnant as a result. I heard she's keeping the baby out of family obligation. It’s reported to be a male someone in her family wanted her to keep to pass down their family's first name as traditionally done for males in their family. There's this tradition of females still retaining their last names while married to males which I hear is currently popular at the moment."
He stopped talking to frown staring at Elise who spoke "You own a vehicle or take public transportation?"
Guardian spoke "I take public transportation. It is company sponsored airbus for people working for the company living in the Cairo city area. Ms. Lyons and I used that mode of transportation after hiking a lengthy twenty minute walk to the town library parking lot. This happened in various kinds of weather to meet the airbus parked there. For there was a selected area was where people could park their cars and not worry about it towed away or paid a fee for it. It was sponsored by the company supporting the town library through various money donations. The airbus ride was reportedly a fifteen minute flyover to Merryville where the factory building was. This happened before it was destroyed by a spinner going through that area that caused the town too much damage in money amounts. Trick wound up laying me off despite not doing it towards others. It was as said to me by Ms. Lyons who kept some kind of communication connection to the company. I'm not even sure of why I was laid off instead of promoted to manager. The manager job was offered to employees who did something impressive to the company's President. That mostly involves doing something nice to the President's son. He was reportedly a spoiled brat and treated employees rudely according to other employees in my presence. I still can't figure out how I got fired for saving the President's son during the spinner storm hitting the building. Bloody Hades!" 
Guardian clamped his mouth shut again and eyed Elise who after a lengthy typing onto her computer pad. 
He frowned as she spoke "Scuttlebutt is that the President's son was embarrassed from having his life saved by an employee. That includes being in some debt towards the employee for doing it as honor bound by being a part of Samira's code of honor. I believe the son ordered you lay off and given a pension in response to saving his life. This included with having part of your rent still paid by the company. I do suspect that the company would come to your rescue for your homeless situation as honor bound by the President's son to do it till he saves your life back is when the life debt is paid period." 
He formed a frown hearing that from Elise who added after doing some typing "That's about it for my questioning. I suggest you go inside the bowling alley building. Go join Kendra as she's called and Ms. Lyons for waiting for someone to come pick the three of you up to where you're to stay. I can't say if it'll be the same driver for the three of you. Ms. Lyons and Kendra have both admitted to having family members living out of town at the moment who is being contacted to pick them up. I can't say who'll pick you up for driving you to a place to stay. I have to contact someone in the Samira group to make some phone calls. Just to see who'll take you in till you get back to your feet so go inside now?" 
He obeyed finding the bowling alley was quiet and appeared to be deserted of no one playing bowling while spotting Kendra and Ms. Lyons seated at a booth. Both he saw were not looking interested in playing a game that they had bored expressions on their faces. He frowned and went to the booth to sit next to them, them wordlessly not talking to him or each other.
Guardian sat lengthy till a loud voice spoke loudly "Ma!"
He looked at the entrance to find a young male around his age that reminded him of Ms. Lyons that darted up towards her and gave her a hug before escorting her out. 
She heard talking "Jack the landlord owes me the deposit money I paid him to live at the house as stated on the contract-" 
She became out of his earshot and out of the bowling alley building. He saw them leave sighed loudly to hear a disgust sound from Kendra who resumed that bored expression on her face. He eyed her warily till he looked away and looked at the entrance seemingly lengthy. He saw an older male with grey in his hair and wearing a police uniform came inside in view that gave him a glare as the male walked in his direction. 
He frowned but didn't comment as the policeman arrived to the booth speaking "Kendra, come with me now." 
Guardian watched as Kendra obeyed wordlessly following the officer out of the building out of sight. He resumed staring at the entrance seemingly lengthy to see people come inside wearing uniforms and carrying bags going to booths. 
He wound up approached by a female wearing a waitress uniform speaking "If you're not going to be playing bowling hit the bar in that direction and stay and wait there. The bowlers will rope you into bowling till closing time of midnight like they have always done towards anyone found new in here."
Guardian didn't say a word got up and went to the bar area as pointed out by the waitress. He walked inside finding the bar had two doors showing its entrance. He went to sit at a bar stool facing the entrance and frowned as a throat clearing noise sounded off his left. He found a male a bartender wearing a suit he assumed was the male's job. 
The male spoke "We're not open for business." 
He spoke "Excuse me just sitting here avoiding playing bowling." 
Guardian looked away to again hear from the bartender his familiar words. He ignored till a hand tapped him on the shoulder off his right. He looked to find the hand's owner was a big burly male appearing to be taller than him that jabbed a finger at the bar entrance.
The burly male spoke "Get out."
He frowned but wordlessly obeyed leaving the bar to find a Samira male at the entrance talking to a waitress as he heard bowling sounds sounding. 
He went to the waitress and Samira loudly speaking "I’m Guard Beers. Something I can do for you?"
He got from the Samira male "You?!"
The male's tone sounded rude to him. 
Guardian frowned inwardly as the Samira looked him up and down before adding "Come along." 
He obeyed following to a car parked among cars in the lot.
Guardian got ordered "Go sit in the back." 
He obeyed. Guardian sat buckling up his seatbelt and eyed the Samira who got inside and started up the car. He wound up hearing the Samira turning on the radio that gave up drumming sounds very loudly too loud for him to converse with the male. Guardian sat in the car as the Samira drove it out of the parking lot. The Samira he saw appeared to drive quite lengthy appearing to be out of Cairo and on the highway taking a lengthy route. Guardian saw the ocean off his right along with signs of inhabitants of houses nearby off his left. He frowned as the driver got the car off the highway into an apparent small town that had stores he recognized for food and touristy stuff. 
He saw the sign for the town he read "Welcome to Beach City!" 
Guardian frowned inwardly of what he was going to do in this ocean touristy town. He continued to frown as the Samira drove to a house appearing to have stairs in it for its tall height and parked the car in the driveway.
He heard the radio shut off followed by "Get out of the car now."
Guardian obeyed and wordlessly followed the male to the front door. 
He saw the male ring the doorbell which was answered by an old female who spoke "Yes something I can do for you?"
He heard from the Samira "Olivia, this is Guard Beers the new tenant I called you about."
He frowned as the old female spoke "I'm not Olivia but her Mother, Rita. I'll go get my daughter excuse me."
Guardian frowned eyeing the door as Rita he assumed he'll call her left the door open but screen door shut and walked out of sight. Guardian waited impatiently as a younger female with brown hair in a long length pulled back while wearing a Samira dress. She appearing to look heavily pregnant to him arrived to stand out the door to stare at him lengthy. The staring made him uncomfortable till he heard a faint doorbell ringing. Guardian frowned finding the male Samira had ring the doorbell by hand onto it.
The young female he saw walked outside and spoke "Thanks Jones, I can take it from here." 
He eyed the male Samira who walked away.
He heard from Olivia he assumed was her name "Follow me."
Guardian obeyed following her to around the house's side to find a driveway having two parked cars and a fence in front of it that appeared to be made out of wood. He frowned as she unlocked the fence's lock by key on a keychain and led him to the backyard and still around the house. He frowned to find her leading him to an entrance to the back of the house that appeared to be a basement apartment to him. Guardian got thrust the keys which he gripped.
He got from her "Good luck Mister Beers."
He frowned at Olivia's comment before watching her walk out of sight. He heard the fence sounded of being manipulated to him. Guardian frowned further forming the expression on his face but went down the steps to the screen door finding a door behind it. He found two of the keys led to that door as he unlocked it without any difficulty. Guardian got inside finding the lights were off. He used the sunlight from outside to find the light switch. He found a living room with a wall opening in his line of sight that appeared to show the kitchen peeking through it. Guardian shut the door and locked it and gave the apartment a through check. He finding the place was a one bedroom apartment fully furnished with items needing to sleep in it. He finding it included with various electronic equipment in the living room that was for TV watching and didn't find a radio among them. He explored the apartment as thoroughly as he could to find another door leading to the laundry room and found stairs leading up to Olivia's house inside. 
He figured thinking "The laundry is shared. I got to when I remember ask her on when I can use the laundry facilities."
Guardian wandered inside the apartment looking inside dressers and closets. He finding nothing but cleaning supplies along with nothing to indicate them holding anything for him to exchange clothes. He found towels in the bathroom that had a shower stall and no tub. There was nothing to indicate on washing himself clean. He sighed and peered into the refrigerator to find it empty of food along with peering into the cupboards to find nothing inside. 
Groaning he found the phone on the wall and saw a sign saying "This phone is contact to Olivia, the landlord for emergencies only after pressing the number seven on the button period." 
He sighed and walked out of the apartment locking the door and went to the fence. Guardian finding the sun was still shining but appeared to be low in the sky. 
Guardian recalled while thinking to himself "The car I was in was wound up driving by a grocery store. I figured to myself that I'll go walk towards it."
He hooked the keychain to his shorts. Guardian walked a lengthy route towards the grocery store to find it open. 
He saw a sign on the glass door saying "Always open and never closed." 
Guardian walked inside finding the store clerk giving him a glare of suspicion he ignored. Guardian wandered around picking up a cloth bag for buying groceries. He got it full and hauled it to the clerk's register to place it there. 
He frowned as the store clerk an old man spoke "Name's Seaman. Welcome to Beach City. Your purchase judging by the looks of you will be hand print only. Excuse me while I ring up everything." 
He frowned as Seaman he assumed was his name, rang up everything in the cloth bag along with resuming putting them back inside. 
He spoke "The name's Guard Beers, sir. I recently arrived in town. You care to direct me to where I can find items such as clothes?"
He eyed Seaman who gave him a narrowed eyed glare of suspicion again, that paused from ranging up food and non food items that kept staring at him. 
It made him uncomfortable and made him talk "My home was an apartment in a house in Cairo that got burned to the ground some vampire spider infestation. The clothes on me are what I was able to take out and nothing else. I currently live in a basement apartment on Dorrance Street in the house of a female named Olivia. You know her?"
He clamped his mouth shut feeling himself annoyed with what he said including saying vampire instead of Drainer regarding the spiders. He watched as Seaman in response ignored his question, resumed ranging up his food before stopping to thrust him a computer pad. 
Seaman heard speaking "Your hand’s print please." 
He obeyed putting his hand onto there to hear a beep sound.
Seaman added after he removed his hand "That's about it. Everything is taken care of. You'll find the clothes shop for males' clothes down the street called Lang but unfortunately their closed at this hour. It'll open at eight o'clock in the morning sharp period tomorrow. Their closed at five o'clock in the evening. Its six o'clock at the moment. I also suggest you go to this Inn called Boonsboro on Grasso Street if you're looking for a job. The Inn is hiring at the moment. They are quite desperate to fill up positions tourist season coming up in three suns. So dress up quite nicely when you go to there for a job. They have some kind of dress code involving employees and people hoping to get a job from there. Good luck with that."
He didn't comment a response gave Seaman a head bob and took the bag of items with him out of the store. He walked out going down the street to find the males' clothing store. He saw from peering through the window appeared to be focused onto suits and clothes related to it. He noted the hours were on the door as said by Seaman. Guardian walked back to the apartment as the sunlight became dim. He got to the apartment finding a light above blink on flooding the dim lighted sun area brightly. He let himself inside with the keys and locked the door behind him. Guardian went to the kitchen putting away the food and putting away the soap and shampoo he bought from the grocery store into the bathroom. 
Guardian put the cloth bag into the cupboard finding a sign on the bag's front saying "Save the environment reuse the bag for shopping at the grocery store." 
He figured to he "I might as well do what the bag's wording says and use the bag for groceries."
He took off his sneakers and left them near the door to the apartment's entrance. Guardian went to sit down on the couch finding a remote on the coffee table for the flat screened TV stuck to the wall. He turned on finding only three channels. That were involved with the news in West Allied state and a channel involving the weather in the Mahalia nation continent and nothing else. He sighed and focused onto one of the state news' channel. He recognizing it as the one he listened to via radio and listened to it boring him. 
They stopped boring him when they started talking "Missus Sally Lyons' house burning to the ground an offspring vampire spider infestation. The vampire spiders' Mother was later caught and taken out of the house then brought to a lab specializing on testing dangerous gonoids. This including making them become harmless after tests were done on them." 
He frowned to listen to the reporter showing a footage of the wreckage and then gesturing to a male wearing medical uniform of a doctor on his form while speaking "The vampire spiders' Mother what does she look like anyway?"
The doctor he assumed was the male's title was holding up a see through cage box showing a big spider inside that made him grimace seeing it. 
He listened to the doctor saying "The spider is what it looks like as the parent of the offspring vampire spiders."
He frowned eyeing the TV as the doctor was asked "How cans this spider be the vampire spiders' creator even if it's a female? What about male spiders?"
Guardian heard "Only females mating with a male spider regardless of species can produce offspring that have vampire ability to suck blood. The offspring spiders suck blood to shed that vampire ability by growing a new body and don't have that ability with the new body's forms. They sucked enough blood from whatever source they could get and don't spare manoids of that sucking either. The vampire ability gets dropped for good after their new body is fully grown and shed."
Guardian continued to watch the TV finding the interview over and the news going to elsewhere. The weather report for West Allied state came on he listening to it thoroughly.
The news saying "The Mahalia nation's national holiday dubbed Mahalia Day is coming up in three suns. Mahalia Day has habitually marked the opening of tourist season for Mahalia natives in the island continent nation."
He frowned as the weatherman continued to talk "The weather is going to be perfect for the holiday for tourists to do their traveling. It's for a week as schools and major government businesses are closed for a week to honor Mahalia Day. The holiday is actually a week long holiday as proclaimed by a King back then. This happened after taking the nation's title position. This was reportedly proclaimed after the Brittany natives' monarchy rule was removed."
He sighed again from hearing that as the news continued to broadcast till "It's time of eight o'clock which we'll be back at eleven o'clock for furthering this news' broadcast." 
Guardian found a commercialized program for women's undergarments involved with highlighting their breasts' areas taking its place. He sighed and flicked the channels finding the other local news' channels had paid programs in them except for the weather channel. 
He heard "We are blaring news on the weather involving the Mahalia nation. The blaring is all over Mahalia island continent instead of focused onto West Allied state." 
He sighed and felt himself bored after watching the weather channel's blared that line over and over instead of showing any weather related. He shut off the TV. Guardian placed the remote down onto the coffee table. He got up and looked around and figured that he'll do his stretching exercises. 
Guardian proceeded to do but got up awkwardly thinking "I'll avoid the karate and go to bed." 
Guardian went into the bedroom putting the keys on the dresser and sighed finding the light lamp in the darkness of the room having a window covered by a shade. He turned on the lamp and eyed the bed to find the blankets and sheets were folded at the foot instead of on the thing. Guardian with another sigh set the bed for sleeping in along with putting the pillow in pillowcase. He got himself on top of the bed which he leaned over and shut the lamp. He stared at the ceiling seemingly lengthy in the darkness till he felt himself tired enough to sleep shut his eyes and passed out unconscious. 

Guardian came to hearing the doorbell and alarm clock blare its noises. He threw himself awake to sit on the bed and turned on the lamp to eye the time on the electronic alarm clock seeing it was six o'clock in the morning. He shut off the alarm and heard the doorbell continue on ringing. He got up grabbing his keys and darted towards the door to yank it open to find Rita standing on the steps that thrust in front of her a set of papers that looked like printed writing. 
She heard saying "Your chores your to do while you live here for free like anyone else living in this apartment." 
He frowned but opened the screen door and took the papers as Rita turned around and walked up the steps walking out of sight. 
He examined the papers finding it listed chores including a note said "You're indicated to do the yard work around the yard surrounding the house with the items were from the shed in the backyard. You're expected to do the yard work period within a time frame for doing them." 
He sighed and put the papers on the coffee table and went to the kitchen to prepare a meal of cereal finding dishes in the cupboards and no pans indicating for stove work. Guardian found a microwave for cooking but nothing to indicate stove cooking. He ate the cereal the best he could then gulped down some milk from the carton and put the dishes away once cleaned in the sink not finding a dishwasher in sight. He went to his shoes and put them on then eyed the note to recall its contents fully.
Guardian groaned loudly to he "Can't believe I'm roped into doing yard work again."
He left the apartment locking the door. Guardian went up the stairs to find the shed in the backyard of the fenced yard. Along with noticing that the yard looked like it needed mowing to him. 
He sighed thinking to himself "I recalled meeting Jack an older male the Landlord of the apartment building in Cairo. Jack some bald head Mahalian wearing a suit like a lawyer giving up the name of Jackson. He wound up insisting on being called Jack to me after we shook hands his grip tight onto my right hand. I recalled Jack during a visit to the apartment house roped me into doing yard work. I getting the lawnmower from the basement and mowing the lawn." 
Guardian mentally thought to himself "I recalled later Jack telling me 'Your rent would go down to five hundred pounds if you willingly did the yard work instead of paying six hundred pounds as original rent price.' 
I recalled telling him 'I agree I'll do the yard work. I request the necessary equipment for it.'
I got from Jack pointing to the basement door entrance to Ms. Lyons' apartment and adding 'You'll find the equipment inside.'
I found myself doing the yard work whenever it needed lawn mowing during the warm months. This included along with doing the shoveling of sidewalks and snow plowing the driveway during the cold snowy winter months." 
Guardian groaned of his thoughts and yanked opened the shed door to find to his annoyance a push mower instead of an electric mower. He found several other tools that indicated muscle use to his disgust. He pulled out the push mower and he began mowing the lawn in the back yard. Guardian wound up finding the yard went around the side of the house. It was by the fence's indicating it that led to the front yard. The fence ended near the front door marking the boundary of the sidewalk to there. He mowed the entire lawn then once done felt himself weary. Guardian felt himself still having strength hauled the push mower to the shed. He saw Olivia outside standing at the top step of his apartment. He cleared his throat loudly to see her look in his direction. He hauled the push mower towards her and stood frowning.
She spoke "I forgot one detail on the list of chores I gave you. It involves deposing the yard's garbage work. It's into the designated garbage can that is colored green. The garbage can is to be put on the front yard for garbage pick up every Tim's day each week. The garbage can is there."
He saw her point a finger in a direction. Guardian saw the garbage can sitting next to the fence. It was appearing to be on the large size and had a lid with the word yard scrawled on it in white. He sighed and didn't comment as Olivia lowered her pointing finger after he resumed looking at her. 
Olivia added "There's a major store in town called Terrio. The store is a good twenty minutes walking distance from here on Main Street. It sells various stuff including clothes that you can get for doing yard work and wearing every day. Go see about going there. They also sell food and some items related to it at a cheaper price than Seaman's grocery store. Seaman's grocery store focuses on selling only items for tourists to get whenever they travel through." 
He sighed again and spoke as Olivia gave him a glare "Seaman of that grocery store told me of a men's store called Lang-"
He was interrupted "That store sells clothes from the price of one thousand pounds and up. They won't accept you into there judging by the looks of you. They have only accepted males who dressed appropriately to shop in there and purchase items. Sometimes discounted for five hundred pounds depending on how nice the male's clothes are period."
Guardian groaned as Olivia spoke after a pause "Well get onto your yard work now." 
He watched her leave out of sight. He hauled the push mower into the shed. Guardian saw a shovel in there indicating for snowy weather along with bags of salt for ice. He found gloves for wearing for doing yard work put them on. He began cleaning up the yard of its messes left from the mowing. Guardian wound up trimming the bushes and cleaning up the fallen branches. He put the mess into the garbage can marked for it. Guardian felt himself relieved to be done put the gloves back into the shed. Guardian went inside his apartment to hit the bathroom intending to shower. He stripped himself of his clothes and showered thoroughly then came out to dry himself. He groaned eyeing his clothes. Guardian finding that they looked sweat stained to him. He put on along with his sneakers and grabbed the keys leaving the bathroom to head to the kitchen. He got some cereal from the box and ate a few mouthfuls of it then gulped down some milk from the carton. He left the apartment once done locking the door and walked out of the yard. Guardian went to the front yard finding Rita on the porch reading a book appearing to look like a romance novel by the couple in a clinch on it. He cleared his throat loudly finding that Olivia was no where in sight. Guardian waited as Rita looked up at him with an annoyed expression on her face. 
Guardian spoke "Your daughter Olivia told me of a store named Terrio where I can get necessity things and items. You care to direct me to the direction of where it is?"
He eyed Rita who jabbed a finger in a direction same direction of where he walked to the Seaman's grocery store. 
Guardian got from her "You'll find Main Street that direction. There's a big sign in the sky that indicates on where that store is. It's trying to get travelers traveling on the highway to the store. So go on and leave me in peace with my reading." 
He didn't comment a response as Rita resumed reading her book. He walked to Main Street in the direction she pointed to look up at the sky around the street repeatedly. 
Guardian found the sign for the store a billboard actually indicating it along with directions of where to go. Guardian wordlessly followed walking to find it was a large building next to a highway traveling near the docks. He finding himself relieved that he didn't have to cross the highway finding a covered caged walkway bridge overhead that had stairs. 
He went to the stairs to find an elevator nearby that had a sign saying "Elevator is monitored heavily for abuse use. It's only for emergencies. People who are contained in disabled status can use period."
He went up the stairs and found this seemed lengthy to him making him annoyed. The wind was felt blowing getting harder as he reached the bridge to find the air was windy and cools to him. It made him walk on the area faster till he reached the stairs on the other side. Guardian went down them going to the parking lot of the store to notice the cars in the lot weren't many. 
He frowned thinking "I'm wondering if the store is open or not. I might as well go check." 
He went to the entrance to find its metal glass doors remained shut to notice the hours posted on it for summer months. 
He saw the store's sign saying "Store opens at ten o'clock in the morning sharp period with police taking notice of loiters hanging around." 
He sighed and thought to himself "I think I need to buy a time piece to see what time it is."
He eyed the sky finding the sun wasn't high enough to indicate the ten o'clock time frame. Guardian went back to the bridge and leaned against the metal wire rimmed fence eyeing the traffic going by in opposite directions. He wound up seeing some cars get off the highway a good distance away and travel on a road to the store to park. He eyed some of the parked cars to see its drivers get out. He saw people wearing uniforms indicating the store workers getting out of their cars. Guardian watched the people going to the side of the building out of sight. He remained watching the scenery quite lengthy and cooled by the wind blowing till a dog barking loudly broke his thoughts. Guardian looked off his left to find a cop coming into view having a leash on a dog wearing some kind of clothing on its form that was barking loudly. He frowned eyeing the cop as the male shushed the dog by a verbal command unheard. 
The cop then reached him to speak loudly "Sir we have complaints of someone spying onto people from the bridge. They have fingered you as that person. So what do you have to say about that to your defense?"
Guardian spoke "Excuse me, I just recently moved into town. It was after a disaster of a fire destroying my home and every single possession. I was told by the landlady Olivia of the apartment I'm staying in. It's on Dorrance Street. The store Terrio would have everything I need. I don't have a watch on me to tell what time it is. Hence I here am waiting for the store to open at ten o'clock." 
He eyed the cop who glanced at his watch and then looked at him.
The cop spoke "The store won't be open in an hour's time frame. Its nine o'clock on my watch. So sorry you'll have to come back at a later time. Move along now or I'll arrest you for the ridiculous spying your appearing to do."
He groaned softly and without a word walked down the bridge sensing the cop following. Guardian took the stairwell route to sense the cop had stopped his following but was spying onto him by his familiar feeling hitting him. 
He figured thinking "I'll explore the town's stores and see what I could purchase." 
Guardian found the majority of them catered to tourists "Store open at eight o'clock." 
He saw that by the signs on their doors. He saw from the looks of them seemed to be focused onto tourists to buy souvenirs for taking home from visiting the town. He found a clothing store for tourists to buy summer wear clothes. Guardian went inside and explored it. Guardian wound up finding that the clothes were geared towards anyone willing to wear it even if they were male or female. Guardian found three sizes for the clothes that indicated baby wear, kids and adults only. Guardian frowned but figured that he'll buy some of the clothes. He wound up picking up an adult sized t-shirt that had Beach City labeled on it. He wound up finding it the same with shorts. He grimaced inwardly due to finding the prices seemed to indicate it catered towards a rich tourist bracket. Guardian took the clothes to the cash register. Guardian wound up finding an older woman there wearing touristy clothes on her form. 
She spoke "Greetings stranger the name is Tricia, your sales clerk of this store Beach City. You find what you like, hmm?"
He gave a head bob as she held up a familiar computer pad after ranging up his clothes. He got his hand print onto it and heard the familiar beep before removing his hand and picked up the bag holding his clothes.
Tricia he assumed was her name continued speaking "Be seeing you around, Sir." 
He heard a faint giggle from her as he frowned to give her another head bob.
Guardian then walked out of the store he figured "I'll go home then put the clothes on my form before shopping at Terrio's. It's that my sweat stained clothes would cause the employees of the store to kick me out. I think my sweat stains wound up making me look sick actually." 
He walked home to arrive at the house to find Rita still on the porch reading her book. 
He heard "Oops should have told you the hours of Terrio. Or you wouldn't have to buy from that ridiculous touristy store Beach City. Their prices for clothes are outrageous anyway." 
Guardian sighed and found that Rita was still reading her book.
Guardian thought to himself "She must have glanced at me before speaking her comment, Bloody Hades for not telling me at first." 
He went inside his apartment to head towards the bedroom dumping the clothes from the bag. Guardian wound up dumping his tank top and shorts onto the floor leaving him clad in his underwear. He put on the touristy clothes finding it was on the large size for the t-shirt. The shorts were feeling like sliding off of him each time he walked. He groaned and dumped the shorts and exchanged them for his original shorts putting them on. That along with leaving the clothes piled onto the floor near the door to the laundry room. 
Guardian figured "I'll buy detergent from Terrio to wash them including my original clothes." 
Guardian eyed the time on the alarm clock. He finding it was almost ten o'clock. 
He thought to himself "I'll go out and go to the store which would be open by the time I arrived there." 
Guardian walked out of the apartment to meet Olivia on the top of the steps looking annoyed.
Olivia spoke seeing him "There you are. I wish you would get a calendar for telling what the date is. Today was garbage day. You should have put the yard garbage on the front lawn instead of leaving it in the back yard. Now you have to dump all that stuff across the street into the forest. I don't want gonoids making a nest out of the mess in the yard garbage can despite them able to get inside it. So move it with the dumping now." 
He groaned softly to go to the garbage can finding it had wheels. Guardian pulled the garbage can out of the yard. He wound up sensing Olivia following by his familiar sense blaring. He heard a door slam once leaving the fenced area and passed the door to her house on the side. Guardian looked to find the road clear of traffic. He went across the street finding a two wire fence blocking his way of gaining entrance to the forest. He saw wooden posts with the fence wires wrapped around them. Guardian hauled the garbage can over the fence dumping its contents into the forest seeing it wasn't that vast. That the forest had a beach peeking between trees in his eyesight. He hauled the garbage can across the street again finding no traffic. Guardian brought the garbage can back into the backyard putting it back in its spot. He sighed finding Olivia back at the top of his steps with arms folded. He went up to her with a questioning look on his face who thrust him a rolled piece of paper that appeared to be multiple papers rolled together he took. He found it was a monthly calendar after examination.
He got told what it was from Olivia mentioning "The calendar started at Octavia this cycle. It ends at Desiree next cycle. Today the date is Octavia twenty nine. Please use it to tell the date and whenever to do garbage duty. The day for garbage hauling is always on Tim's days in the summer months but changes to Man's days during the winter season. The day for garbage hauling in winter is mostly the day after Man's day if the weather was bad." 
He didn't comment a response as Olivia walked off after giving him her talk. Guardian went inside the apartment and found a hook on a cupboard for hanging the calendar. He put on there opened to the present cycle. 
Guardian wound up thinking "Olivia is right. Calendar indicates it's starting at Octavia the lunar month."
Guardian found a pen attached that indicated it was for crossing off dates. He found dates crossed off except Octavia twenty nine. 
He sighed and walked out of the apartment after locking the door to again find Olivia at the top of the steps with arms folded making him gulp seeing the glare on her face. He eyed Olivia as he went up the stairs to stand next to her.
She spoke he heard "I received a visit from our residence Gonoid Unit cop Trooper Frankie and his dog Bixler. Trooper Frankie wound up telling me that you were caught spying onto the natives from on the bridge to the Terrio store. This was as complained by people noticing you there lengthy." 
He sighed and spoke "Excuse me I didn't have a watch to tell the time for knowing when the store Terrio would open at ten o'clock. I thought I would stay on the bridge and wait for the store to open. Should I have done something else?"
He eyed Olivia who gave him a narrowed eyed glare before speaking "You should have gone to the parking lot. Waited till an employee arrived to ask what time it was before doing something else to pass the time. You should be doing that instead of standing on the bridge waiting for the store to open. Trooper Frankie told me he'll arrest you next time he finds you spying there again. That along with hitting me a high price hundred pound currency sum as your landlord. Don't do that spying again or I'll kick you out on a permanent basis. You get it my words Mister Beers?"
He frowned to give her a head bob as Olivia walked off jabbing a finger in his direction. Guardian saw her going out of sight hearing the fence's door bang shut with a loud slam along with a faint door slam sounded. 
He sighed and figured "I'll go to the Terrio store to buy some items." 
Guardian added "The store is open and would be open by the time I arrived there." 
He left the yard to hit the front yard to hear from the porch "Hold on a minute Mister Beers." 
Guardian turned to eye Rita who appeared to laugh quietly before stopping her laughing manner as he gave her a glare of accusation on his face and eyes.
Rita he glared at spoke ignoring his glare "Mister Beers I must warn you that Olivia has a reputation to hold in town among the natives despite her expectant status happening at the moment. Her reputation is that she takes in people into her home or apartment for free to live there. The people who live here wound up working on gaining what they need to live independently. As in getting back on their feet from them suffering a disaster of losing everything they own. She harbors people like you to get what they need back from the disaster. Such as helping them save money to help them live in a dwelling elsewhere than in the Beach City town. She expects people who live with her in the house and in the apartment to behave appropriately around town. That includes treating people appropriately in a manner she expects them to do it. I warn you that Olivia has despite her expectant status has managed to kick out people successfully. People who didn't do what were expected of them each time they did something that weren't up to her standards. Just be warned that those people have wound up jailed for a time period. That along with not accepted back into residence once the jail sentence was up. Just be warned of that Mister Beers." 
He opened his mouth to speak only to see Rita resume reading her book. Guardian saw that Rita appeared to be engrossed in it despite him clearing his throat repeatedly. He sighed and walked away. 
Guardian thought to himself "Bloody Hades to Rita! I'll go to the Terrio store and buy what I needed to get from there." 
He took the bridge route to the store finding the cop Trooper Frankie and dog Bixler weren't in sight to his relief. He walked across in the wind to reach the other end to find the parking lot was filled up with cars. Guardian maneuvered around going into the store finding people walking out along with escorted by an employee carrying their packages. He noticing employees were doing the carrying for women wearing high heeled shoes and looking snobby to him by their faces aimed at the air baring their nostrils. He ignored them to go inside the store. Guardian wound up finding the store had three levels for various items on everything he would need to live at the apartment. That including clothes which he selected some Summerland and Winterland geared clothes. Some underwear in packages for lasting two weeks, including a bathing suit short, a watch for telling time, shoes for wearing in the seasons' change over of Summerland to Winterland. This included finding laundry detergent to put it in a carriage and pushed it to the cashier to wait in line. He waited seemingly lengthy as he noticed at the front of the line was a young teenaged female looking annoyed. Guardian saw that the cashier looked annoyed to him. He saw another employee wearing a suit arrive into view talking to the teenager on something who stormed off in an angry mood without any purchases taken with her. The cashier he saw handed the suited male a two piece bathing suit that looked like it didn't give off coverage to him who walked away. Guardian found the line went smoothly till it was his turn. He found that the cashier didn't seem to protest to his remark of paying by hand print. Guardian found his order was obeyed finding everything accepted for purchase and bagged into paper bags with handles on them. He carried out of the store finding he would have to walk home. That was not having a vehicle for carrying his purchases. Guardian sighed as he reached the stairs to the bridge and slowly lumbered up them taking his time. He reached the bridge to walk on it slowly due to feeling he needing to walk slow. He slow walked to the bridge's other set of stairs and took it down and slow. Guardian slow walked himself home. At the apartment he had to put down the bags to unlock the fence and his front door. He hauled everything inside and put the clothes in the bedroom near the laundry room door along with checking the bags for any spiders getting into or onto them. He found nothing to indicate that put them away in the kitchen cupboards. He put the shoe wear next to the front door. Guardian with a groan went to sit down on the couch to turn on the TV after grabbing the remote. He checked the time on the wristwatch to find it was noon. Guardian sighed to eye the TV to find two of the news' programs were airing paid programming. The third had local news broadcasts. He watched the news' broadcast entirely for a full hour. Guardian finding himself bored with the program repeating already broadcasted news every fifteen minutes that involved the West Allied state. 
He always finding the news including one, blurb news on his Father the current King "The King, his wife, daughter and grandson are currently taking residence in a private island. Their all currently out of the country at the moment which was for the Mahalia Day week holiday. His leaving was early instead of waiting till October thirty first as traditionally done for people to start their week holiday." 
He sighed with a loud groan to figure to himself "Octavia is Samira speak for October. Desiree must be speaking for December."
Guardian continued to sit watching the news' broadcast till thirty minutes passed noon is when his stomach growled of hunger. He finding himself hungry which he found the news' program off air and gone to a paid programming. He switched channels to another news channel that wasn't airing paid programming. He raised the volume quite a bit and got up going to the kitchen keeping an ear out for the news' broadcast. 
He cooked a prepared meal in the microwave he thinking "Bloody Hades, I don't have a stove for cooking!" 
He felt his hunger take hold once the microwave was done cooking and quit his thought. Guardian grabbed the food out and grabbed a fork from a drawer and began ravenously eating the food not caring that it was slightly hot for him. He ate everything and dumped the tray into a cupboard's garbage can. Guardian washed the fork before going to the refrigerator to take out the milk carton and gulped down several swallows. He then put the milk back inside before going to the TV to watch the news for the weather report. He rewarded to find it coming on. Guardian listen paying attention to the TV thoroughly. 
He listened to the talking "The weather for the upcoming Mahalia Day holiday week is going to be sunny for travelers and tourists to visit various spots in West Allied state." 
Guardian frowned as they added "There's some slight rain at high elevations but isn't sure if the rain would turn into a rainstorm or not. Computer models are all over the place on that." 
He frowned as he found the news' broadcast was only thirty minutes long. The broadcast had again a blurb about his Father and family. He sighed once the news ended finding a paid program. He switched the TV to the weather channel and lowered the volume eyeing the monitor. 
Guardian listened to them talking "There's a slight no rain drought hitting some of the states on the southwestern part of Mahalia continent including West Allied state at the moment. There's rainy weather predicted to arrive to hit the area but we aren't sure if it'll be enough rain or form into some rainstorm to cause havoc. Computer models are all over the place and not accurate at the moment." 
He sighed and felt himself tired shut the TV off. Guardian leaned back in the couch shutting his eyes only to hear the doorbell ringing. He eyed the time finding that he had only slept for ten minutes. Guardian felt himself much better rested. He went to the door yanking it open to find Olivia at the top of the steps making him confused as to how she rang his doorbell. Guardian frowned to see her hold a remote control in her hand while having arms folded. He eyed her warily as he got up the steps and stood next to her.
She he eyed at spoke "There's rules involving use of the laundry machines and time frames of when you can use them. You can use them anytime after nine o'clock in the morning Women's days. You can't use them after seven o'clock in the evening Woman's days either. You can't use the laundry machines on a Man's End Day."
Guardian translated "Women's Days is weekdays while Man's End Day is weekend."
He paid attention towards Olivia who kept on speaking ignoring him thinking "That's when I set my time frame for myself and the house's inhabitants to do the laundry chore. You're responsible for your own laundry detergent. You're responsible for getting your own clothes out of the laundry machines along with attending to them too. I have a rule of throwing out clothes found abandoned in the laundry machines after a certain time period has passed for them to be taken out. It doesn't matter if it's being washed or dried. The washer machine takes thirty five minutes and the dryer takes an hour. So remember that time frame and remember what I said about clothes found in them after a certain time period has passed. And no I'm not going to tell you what that time period is going to be. For you not abandon your clothes in the machines. That's all see you around."
He watched her leave went inside the apartment and eyed his watch and calendar finding it was a weekday. He figured he'll do the laundry chore which he proceeded to do. Guardian wound up finding the laundry took him two loads to wash and dry all of his clothes omitting the ones he was wearing. He put the clothes away in the dressers and closet once done. Guardian put the laundry detergent on the floor of the closet. 
He figured out "If I left that laundry detergent in the laundry room it'll be used without my permission. Besides Olivia would have a hissy angry fit about that." 
He sighed and went in the middle of the living room to do his stretching exercises keeping him limber as always that along with swinging himself up to proceed to do his Karate exercises and drills involved in the exercise. 
Guardian wound up feeling himself a bit annoyed as he thought while doing his Kata "I wound up earning the rank of red belt. I feel more annoyed having another rank to go before getting the black belt. There was no way of getting further teaching in the discipline to get the black belt." 
He recalled "My Mother raiser used the name of Verona to people but always omitting the last name when introduced to them. She was always using the name of Guard Beers when introducing me to people. She has habitually from time to time using the name of Guardian to me. Along with as drilled for me to use as a nickname but she never used that name in people's presences instead referred me as Guard." 
He continued to recall "When I was ten cycled old is when Verona I guess I'll call her enrolled me into karate while living in Victoria State. It's the residence state of where the Mahalia nation's ruler the King lived. It was for whenever taking residence in the island continent. I took karate classes and reached the belt of red once turning seventeen along with some teaching involving getting a two colored belt. Karate wound up stopped after Verona passed away unable to pay for the lessons to continue the teaching." 
Guardian continued his karate finding himself still doing the lessons he learned perfect to his standards along with his movement group dubbed a Kata for red belt. 
He felt frustration hitting him "I'm frustrated on not knowing what the Kata for two colored belt was. I could only do some complicated kicking movements involving twisting the body into acrobatic moves. I recalled I was learning on doing that Kata from the sensei aka teacher of karate as they were referred just prior to Verona's death. I'm feeling further annoyed for I wound up finding that I was still was unable to get karate lessons for furthering my karate. The lessons were enough to gain the desired black belt and register in the state's registry for all black belts to do. That was just to give proof of able to teach others karate something that was very strongly frowned upon for belt ranks below black to do period." 
He finished his Kata with a hand fisted and other hand covering his palm then bowed. Guardian went to the TV finding it was still set for the weather channel. The two local news' channels were all showing paid programs after flicking via remote. He felt himself annoyed with the TV shut it off and eyed his watch finding it was still early for dinnertime. He grabbed his keys and walked out of the apartment locking the door. Guardian felt the heat hitting but wasn’t that boiling to him a light wind blowing. He walked around the house going to the porch to find Rita sitting in a lawn chair still engrossed in her book who ignored him sitting next to her. He sat in the lawn chair with arms folded eyeing the scenery outside along with counting cars driving by that seemed few and far between till the front door banged open. 
Olivia's voice was heard loudly "Ma! Ditch that book and come inside. Help me get stuff from the attic for the spare bedroom. My contact in the Samira group called. Contact said that their sending some female unsure of her age or who she is actually to take residence here. So help me get everything ready before she arrives by four o'clock this afternoon." 
He eyed Rita who gave up a loud groaning sound to shut the book after folding a page and got up him watching her and went inside the house still carrying it in her hands. 
He eyed Olivia standing on the porch screen door open by her form who added "I expect you to behave yourself around this female. There will absolutely be no hanky panky behavior of targeting her for mating period. Keep your hands to yourself you hear or I'll kick you out get it?"
He gave a head bob as she gave off disgust sound and went inside screen door slamming with a bang sound. He remained seated on the porch lengthy while glancing at his watch for the four o'clock time frame. Guardian kept up the glancing till an hour passed is when the door to the house slammed again. He looked to find Rita walking out looking like she was tired and saw her slump into the lawn chair hand still holding her book. She, Guardian saw, appeared to shut her eyes which he figured that she was taking a nap. He looked away glancing at the scenery lengthy till a car came into the driveway. It appearing to be twin to the male Samira's vehicle that drove him to Olivia's house stopped. A male got out wearing Samira clothes who frowned visibly seeing he seated there. He sighed and leaned over towards Rita who was still asleep and gently shook her arm getting her awake. 
Rita wound up sputtering he hearing "I don't want to be waken so let me sleep." 
She gave him a glare after he shook her awake further and he pointed a finger in the direction of the car and the Samira standing next to it. 
He eyed Rita who sighed loudly and then heard her speaking "I’m Rita, Olivia's Mother. Are you here to drop off the female someone in the Samira group told my daughter of?"
He eyed the male who without a word yanked open the back passenger door and then went to the trunk. Guardian saw a female got out wearing a Samira dress. He saw she had his black hair in a longer length and a facial appearance that reminded him of someone that avoided meeting his eyes. That despite seeing them green colored who stood next to the car as the male Samira came into view hauling a suitcase up to the house. The male left the suitcase on the porch before going back to the female and whispering to her then got inside the car and drove it away. He eyed the female warily who refused to meet his eyes instead slow walked up to the house.
She was met by Rita who loudly spoke "Dear, the name is Rita mother of the landlady Olivia who lives here. Don't mind Guard Beers sitting on the porch staring at you who lives in a basement apartment of the house. Must be hormones talking hence he staring. You care to tell me your name Missy?"
He eyed the female who appeared to talk but was mumbling her words too quiet for him to hear. Rita got her inside the house along with hauling in the suitcase with them silently not commenting anything towards him or her in response. He frowned as he checked his watch to find it was after four o'clock. 
Guardian figured "I'll go to my apartment to spend the rest of the day there." 
He proceeded to do going inside turning on the TV to watch the weather report.
They were saying "We're debating on rainy weather predicted to hit the southwestern part of the continent nation. We're debating on what kind of rainy weather it'll be either just regular rain scattered rain or a monsoon rainstorm like." 
He sigh finding himself bored with the program's debate among the weather forecasters talking about the rainy weather while still debating about it till his doorbell rang loudly. He shut off the TV and went to the apartment's entrance to find Olivia at the steps.
She was holding a remote in her hand who spoke loudly "Your mail as addressed to you. You're to get from the marked mailbox saying basement at the end of the driveway. That after me or some house resident does some mail sorting and dumps them in that mailbox. Its your responsibly to get the mail period within a time frame or it's thrown out in the garbage. It doesn't matter if its trash pick up day or not."
He sighed and spoke as Olivia continued to glare at him "The mailboxes, would they be in front of the sidewalk off the driveway's left?"
He eyed her as she gave him a head bob and jabbed a finger in their direction. Guardian without a comment walked out of the yard sensing her following him. Guardian wound up to sense the following stop once he passed the house's side entrance hearing the door slam shut. Guardian bypassed two parked sedans in the driveway to find the mailboxes were where he asked them to be. He went to them to find them in rows of three with one having the Dorrance Street name on it and number twenty nine on it at one end. He found the one in the middle had the word guest on it and the last one had the word basement on it. He sighed and opened the basement labeled mailbox. Guardian looked to find the mailbox was filled with various junk mails of coupons for stores. He sorted through while walking to the fence again bypassing the cars. Guardian found one appeared to be from a lawyer group Visser and Law Associates on its return address. 
He recalling "Visser and Law Associates was the group Jack worked for as the landlord representative of the apartment building I lived in. Wonder what they want now?" 
He found the house's trashcan sitting next to the wall near the side entrance. 
Guardian threw out the coupons and found another piece of mail addressed to basement renter from a post office address in Victoria State in handwriting that seemed feminine. 
He frowned as he opened the Visser and Law Associates' mail to find a letter stating "We are returning the security deposit Trick Party Group paid for you to live at the apartment house. The money is going back to Trick Party Group with awarding you a one thousand pound currency compensation for the lost of your home. The money awarding was the house suffering a spider infestation and burned down by firefighters. It was state law issues for people having twin situations as you went through." 
He sighed and continued to read "You're issued to bring this letter to Victoria bank anywhere in Mahalia nation. It's to get the funds of one thousand pound currency money set aside to be transferred into your account within a time period which is the end of this cycle period." 
He discovered that the old cycle ended in two lunar months for him to do that transfer. He sighed and went inside the yard going into his apartment locking the door. Guardian placed the lawyer group letter in a couch dresser drawer then yanked open the Victoria state letter to get a picture falling out. He picked up and discovered it was the female he and Rita met before both women went into the house. 
He found the letter in handwriting "I'm counting on you to protect Helene as she's dubbed. Helene is in some witness protection program from some male named Kevin Oran. Kevin Oran is reportedly was her ex-husband that was beating her along with flaunting her as the Queen's second daughter to the public. The flaunting was her looks via face were twin to the Queen's in some scams to cheat people out of their money. People were already scammed of their monies and aren't happy with that." 
He continued to read the letter detailing "I'm expecting you to keep Helene safe from her ex-husband reportedly out on bail. Kevin didn't show up for a scheduled court case which police are currently searching for the male. The police got Helene herself into the witness protection program. Kevin Oran was turned into the police by her making an anonymous phone call to them. It was to check him out which happened and the police are fears for her safety." 
He kept reading the letter added "Kevin Oran during his jailed status somehow found out that Helene was the one who turned him to the police. Kevin has been overheard swearing dangerous threats of killing her in people's presences and that she brought up the divorce. He's still contesting the divorce at the moment despite a judge declaring them divorced the male is repeatedly denying that at the moment." 
He frowned finding the letter didn't end with a name but with the words "A concerned Mother."
Guardian frowned to put the letter and picture into his couch dresser's drawer along with the lawyer letter included too. He eyed the time and felt himself hungry for dinner went to the kitchen and proceeded to cook a microwave meal of macaroni and cheese. The food was due to feeling like eating it. He again ate out of the tray with a fork once it was done cooking. Guardian not caring that it was quite hot for his taste feeling too hungry to bother protesting. He put the tray into the garbage bin and washed and dried the fork then went to drink some milk out of the carton taking multiple gulps. Guardian finding himself terribly thirsty which he once done eyed the milk carton. He frowned to find it was less than halfway full for its big size. 
Guardian thought "I'll go buy some more milk the next day." 
He continued to think "Olivia would have a fit if she heard of me traveling around town at night. Something single people were frowned on doing very strongly alone." 
He sighed and went to the TV turning it on to the local news' channel finding it was minutes before the news would come on. Guardian eyed the TV watching the paid program for girls' toy jewelry making him bored till the program came on. Guardian watched the local news entirely. Guardian finding the local news was repeating some of its broadcasted news he saw at noon from five o'clock to five thirty boring him. 
They started airing something new "There's a rumor that the King and family members weren't really vacationing at his private island but instead at a hospital unknown. 
The rumor is reportedly said ‘The King is to be on the continent specialized for children focused onto his grandson that seemed to indicate a medical problem.’ 
The rumor hasn't specialized on what the problem is for a three month old to require a hospital stay which could be anything."
He groaned loudly hearing the news' broadcast on his Father and talking about his nephew. 
This including the news' reporters talking "A doctor of a local children's hospital was asked on what medical conditions could affect a three month old that would require a hospital stay." 
He heard various medical conditions involving the doctor's answer. 
Then heard "There's one involved the heart organ having children born with heart problems coming into the hospital for surgeries to fix the problem. The age for the surgery to fix the problem right away was around three months old. It was how obvious the heart organ was affecting the child enough to require surgery for it despite not displaying any signs of distress before the age of three months was reached." 
He sighed as the reporters finished their talk about the doctor. 
The reporters Guardian heard were saying "We're still debating on whether the weather will be a rainstorm or just regular scattered rain that has been hitting the area. We're pretty sure the rain will not cure of the drought going on at the moment like what happened nearly every cycles’ at each monthly time of the cycle in West Allied State." 
He sighed again and heard the doorbell ringing loudly shut off the TV putting the remote down onto the coffee table. Guardian went to the front door to find Olivia at the top of the steps with arms folded a glare on her face. He sighed and left his door open while leaving the screen door shut. Guardian went up the stairs to stand next to her with a frown on his face.
Guardian eyed Olivia warily "I'm told you received a document detailing what my newest resident's purpose of living here so confirm that." 
He spoke "I have received such a document labeling her as Helene in case you want to know what name used. There was a picture of her included appearing to be from her Mother despite a name omitted on the letter. The letter's wording hinted to me on having to expects me to help keep things safe around here as my duty as a male to provide that safety issue." 
He clamped his mouth shut while eyeing Olivia who gave up a loud Hmph sound before adding "Anything you can provide this safety issue for a female to acquire?"
He spoke "I have kept up practiced training in combative art called karate with belt rank of red since I was seventeen. There is another belt I have to acquire before I can acquire the black belt the highest rank. Then declare myself a black belt and register via state law to teach karate. I haven't been able to get any further karate training since my raiser passed away when I was seventeen. Courts declared me a legal adult at that age. I'm currently aged twenty six at the moment. I'm still struggling to find a karate school I can afford on my pension from working at a company."
He kept talking as Olivia made no motion to talk "I'm also am struggling to get my diploma. For me to qualify for jobs that require a high school diploma at community colleges that have tuition I can afford. Just to take classes for diploma's related subjects. I was taking one class at Western Community College at night time during the fall semester for three years in classes required for getting a diploma. During the time I was working till they stopped having night classes. I already did about three of the five required classes for that college. I haven't had any luck on getting enough money saved for tuition for the remainder classes. That and money saved for someone to drive me to and from my residence not having my license and a vehicle. This was unfortunate circumstances involving me having to pay things out of my savings." 
Guardian clamped his mouth shut while eyeing Olivia and folded his arms as she spoke "That scar on your arm would that have something to do with not able to save money? It looks like some kind of healed serious injury to me." 
Guardian sighed and spoke "I broke a bone in my arm that went through the skin during a spinner disaster back then. That wound up nearly paralyzing my left hand, nerves cut. I'm unable to write with that hand despite favoring it for writing. I had to pay for some surgical medical expenses and rehab work done onto the area. That involved not having the proper documentation for medical insurance reasons hence I paying for this. I also was laid off from my job after the disaster. I was given some kind of money pension that doesn’t pay me much. It's on where I can live in a dwelling without assistance on the rent payments. I managed to save up enough money for a class at Western including a driver. Unfortunately some departed cop willed a bat cat hybrid for me to take care of months before the state passed a law saying that such gonoids like it weren't to be kept as pets. I wound up having to blow that saved money onto that gonoid's care and medical expenses. I was not willing to contest the willed document's order in court which would leave me in debt of lawyer's fees. I took care of that gonoid for two full lunar months till a crisis hit my home. It's when the vet informed me of the passed state law is when I gave up the gonoid in their care."
Guardian paused to see Olivia's eyes narrow with suspicion in them and frowned as he continued speaking "I did receive a document from the landlord saying I was compensated a money amount. I had to bring that paper to the named bank before the old cycle is over with as the deadline just to get funds transferred."
He clamped his mouth shut as Olivia spoke "The bank that was named what was it?"
He sighed and spoke "Victoria bank." 
Guardian frown eyeing Olivia who gave up a loud Hmph sound and spoke "The nearest Victoria bank branch I know of is in an hour's drive from Beach City. It's in the town of West Alia. I'll see if Ma can give you a ride to there on Saturday. She's expected to drive me to the Terrio store. I can purchase the necessity items for me and my house guests like I always expect her to do every Saturday period." 
He gave a head bob in response as she walked away going around the house. He went back inside the apartment shutting and locking the doors. Guardian eyed his wrist watch finding that he missed fifteen minutes of the news' broadcasts. He switched on the TV and sat on the couch listening to the news. 
He frowned as the news kept blabbing "The King and family are having a medical crisis related to the son. It was rumored reportedly said by some source within the King's circle. The source that was leaking secret information about the King and family for money amounts. The leaking was to a tabloid focused on trashing royal families ruling the Mahalia nation and allied islands underneath the King's rule." 
Guardian sighed listening to that program finding it was old news of them repeating "The King has fathered a son through an actress still not identified to this day. That along with not publicity flaunting the son to the public as people hoped despite him reportedly an adult age at the moment. It included debates on if he should be the heir to the throne instead of the grandson born through the King's oldest child a daughter." 
Guardian found he bored listening to the news' reporters talk "We debate on whose should take the King's crown after the King is unable to rule. We debate whether if the title should go to the son the King fathered or the grandson recently born through the daughter three months back." 
Guardian groaned hearing that the debate was old news to him. The debate made him feel bored that people were always in a dead heat battle on that debate with no side appearing to win it. From hearing the debate on the news and from hearing it from town's folk in Cairo in his presence debating the issue. He sighed and leaned back in the couch eyes staring at the ceiling. Guardian continued to hear the debate raging on the TV that seemed to get heated quite a bit. 
The debate quit after cutting to another reporter he heard interrupting the argument "The weather for the upcoming rainstorm isn't good despite still that computer models were all over the place. That on whether the upcoming rain would produce enough rain to end the drought or give some rain just to fill in some bodies of water. The rain to keep them up for people to get something to drink after it's purified." 
He sighed again to focus onto the TV "This is Kevin Oran." 
The TV he saw wound up showing a picture of a male looking bald with brown eyes and saying "The police are searching for this male Kevin Oran for not showing up for a scheduled dated court appearance. The police mentioned this was after bonding himself out of jail via money used from scamming various people out of their money fortunes. The police were still trying to recover the rest of the money reportedly in a low million pound amount after getting the banks to freeze his assets. Kevin wouldn't have use of the currency after he bonded himself out of jail. Kevin hasn't been seen in the Georgina, West allied state capital area since his freed status. There were rumored sightings of him traveling via highway in a car vehicle that was reportedly stolen. The sightings were said to be all over the place in the state. It's making the cops suspicious that he had some money set aside and paid people to tell the cops these leads to throw them off his trail." 
He continued to listen to the news' reporter talking "The cops have recently at previous news' broadcast issued a one hundred thousand currency pound award for the capture of Kevin Oran. This broadcasted status has brought too many calls to the station of people claiming to have captured the fugitive. The calls have turned out to be scam attempts to gain the money. It was how poor the state's economy is going with the clean up from the spinner disaster awhile back. The cleanup still ongoing reportedly in a high million pound mark. That included a drought hitting at the moment that is causing havoc with farming food nourishments and livestock to live off the ground's nourishments." 
He felt himself bored with the news eyed the time finding it was still not time for the news to end. Guardian continued to listen to it absent mildly while staring at the ceiling only glancing at the TV whenever something caught his ears making him want to view it. 
He kept it up till he heard "It's eight o'clock. It's when we'll quit for the time being before coming back on at eleven o'clock." 
Guardian shut off the TV and thought "I figured that I'll go do some stretching of limber exercises and then go to bed." 
He proceeded to stretch his limber exercises. Guardian stretched finding himself still limber as ever. Since he started the exercises as a seventeen taking a gym class for after high school and kept up the practice to he after a full cycle of taking the class. He once done heard the doorbell ringing groaned and eyed his watch finding it was nine o'clock in the evening dark time. Guardian peered through the peephole finding no one there and the light off which confused him. 
He recalled "Bloody Hades, the doorbell got to be the door to the laundry room!" 
Guardian darted towards the door yanking it open to find Rita there who looked relieved to see him. 
He frowned eyeing Rita who spoke "Olivia wanted me to see if you were home or not but since your home I can go tell her that." 
He spoke as Rita made a motion to leave "Excuse me but where is the doorbell involved with this door anyway?"
He eyed her as she pointed out the doorbell. 
She spoke "Olivia expects you to be in residence no later than eight o'clock at night. It's for safety issues involving people targeting tourists wandering around town after that hour. She also expects you to still be in residence till after seven o'clock in the morning. That time is when you can leave to do what you need to do around town. I do warn you that Olivia's curfew is related to the safety of a female guest. She named Helene that is currently in the witness protection program. It's a criminal matter of a criminal targeting her in some deathly way hence the curfew to keep things safe here." 
He sighed and gave a head bob as Rita left him going up the stairs passed the laundry machines. He shut the door to the apartment and locked it. 
Guardian figured "I'll leave the door unlocked in case the ladies needed to get through my apartment for safety reasons. I'll proceed to do." 
He wandered to the living room to take a look around eyeing the apartment's contents finding nothing to amuse him. Guardian wound up not finding any books in vicinity for him to read. He wandered into the bedroom eyeing the alarm clock and went to it setting it to go off at seven o'clock in the morning. He then stripped himself of his clothes and underwear leaving him naked in the room. Guardian still holding onto his dirty clothes going to put them on the floor near the laundry room door when the door opened showing Helene looking shocked to see him. He covered his sensitive part with his clothes thrust in front of it in a fast move.
Guardian spoke "That's not why I left the door unlocked, Miss Helene." 
Guardian narrowed his eyes aimed at Helene who spoke loudly looking not so shocked but amused "Sorry didn't realize." 
He eyed her as she backed up still ogling him making his senses blare warning. She shut the door with a gentle slam which he threw his clothes in a pile near the door. Guardian went to put on a pair of shorts set aside for him to sleep in while glaring at the door. 
He fumed to himself "Bloody Hades, Helene turned me off with her intrusion. Her reaction towards seeing my muscular body is making me think something else is going on with her." 
Guardian went to his bed after waving a hand fisted aimed at the laundry door and shut off the lamp after getting on top of the blankets. He feeling himself tensed up to sleep so he laid on the bed staring at the ceiling seemingly lengthy. He felt himself able to sleep shut his eyes passing out unconscious. 

Guardian came to hearing the door to his apartment leading to the laundry room opening along with seeing a bit of a flashlight that shut itself off once the door to the room was shut. He lay still listening keeping his breathing regular. Guardian listened as there were sounds of another person in the room breathing loudly.
He heard "Bloody Hades, he had to leave the lights off!"
He sensed the voice belonged to Helene as she was detected to make her way towards his bed. He reached over towards the lamp and turned it on. Guardian eyed Helene standing near the foot wearing some slinky bathrobe that was short baring her legs. He saw a frown expression on her face that turned to amusement as she disrobed the bathrobe baring her towards him. 
He sighed figuring out "Bloody Hades, she wants to have a mating ritual. What the Bloody Hades is she up to with that?" 
He narrowed his eyes eyeing her in the eyes with a glare. 
Helene spoke "Well don't you want to play with me hmm?"
Guardian heard her voice tone that sounded little girl like and put him off from the mood. He got up from the bed and went to the foot going to Helene thrusting her bathrobe back on covering her form in a fast move. 
He wound up snarling loudly while gripping her shoulders "Talk Helene on your actual feelings towards Kevin Oran. You're not acting like you're scared of him instead acting like your trying to make him jealous." 
He released his hands on her shoulders as Helene's face turned into a glaring expression.
She heard speaking "You should have agreed with this mating ritual for I'll make your life miserable if you don't go along with it. Believe me who'll believe me when I say that you're targeting me for forced mating?"
He glared at Helene despite her using an angry voice tone and using a Republic State accent to him. 
Guardian went to sit at the bed and spoke firmly "Tell me the actual story involving Kevin Oran. I'll do what you want since its obvious he's more than just an ex-husband out targeting you to death." 
He kept up the glare and stripped himself of the shorts tossing them aside off the bed on the right. Guardian folded his arms while clearing his throat ignoring his naked status while noticing Helene ogling him. 
He covered his sensitive part after she stared at it too long to his annoyance with a blanket while again clearing his throat loudly and speaking "Helene talk!"
Guardian glared at Helene who smirked then shook her head before she spoke "Alright Kevin Oran is my ex-husband actually. I brought up the divorce which he's still contesting at the moment some obsession of wanting me as his period. He was a faithful husband agreeing to go along with whatever I said. That involved scamming people out of their money with evidence linking him as the mastermind behind that when it was me actually. I had my face with the right amount of prosthetics attached altered to look like the Queen's. So I would be passed off as the second daughter as flaunted to the public in scams to get people's money. I'm surprised that the Queen hasn't done anything to correct this situation at the moment. That despite me flaunted all over West Allied state as her second daughter. So excuse me while I disrobe and you better not be doing any resisting to this." 
He didn't comment a response adjusted his position till he was completely lying down on the bed with hands behind his head while removing the blanket off of him. He found Helene again ogling him not sparing his sensitive part making he annoyed.
Guardian cleared his throat as he eyed her who wound up removing the bathrobe off her form to drop it onto the floor. He eyed her body not sparing her privates to make him think she was surgically altered to him. Her naked body he saw made him think it was altered by surgery work by the size of her breasts that looked on the big size to him. 
He kept his eyes onto her as he heard "Anna Kremenova hit the floor or I'll taser you out!"
He frowned to see a shocked expression on Helene's face as she obeyed to find two cops coming from the laundry room entrance to arrest her. The cops he saw two of them both getting her back into her bathrobe and reading her rights. She, Guardian saw was giving him a glare as they led her out of his bedroom out of sight. He got up and picked up his pajama shorts putting them on. 
He heard a door knocking sound on his door to the laundry room to find another cop there that spoke "Excuse me there's items in your apartment I have to retrieve so allow me to do this." 
Guardian wordlessly sat on the bed and eyed the cop going to the corner of the bedroom to open a hidden door showing a camera device in the wall to his surprised. The cop taking the recorder entirely out revealing an electric panel in its place which the door was closed shut completely. He spotted a small hole in the wall that looked too large to be a nail hole. He eyed the cop who took the camera device and left his apartment through the laundry room entrance. The cop shutting the door and heard its lock click in place.
He figured "That policeman must have locked the door to indicate everything is fine now." 
He groaned and eyed the time finding it was eleven o'clock in the evening leaned over towards the lamp and shut it off plunging the room in darkness. Guardian laid his form down on the bed eyeing the ceiling as the alarm clock's numbered time glowed red. He eyed till eleven thirty came and he forced himself to shut his eyes sleeping till the doorbell rang loudly as the alarm clock blared its siren waking him up. He groaned eyeing the laundry room door while hearing the doorbell to recognize its tone was indicating Olivia at the top of the steps outside his apartment .He thrust on a tank top and sandals and darted towards the apartment's entrance as the doorbell rang again. Guardian yanked opened the door to find the female landlady standing at the steps with arms folded her familiar remote in her hand. He groaned and darted up the steps to stand near her.
She spoke "Excuse me for waking you up. I've managed to rope my Ma into driving the both of us to West Alia. For me to shop and you to get some money transferred right away today. I believe that banks like government offices are closed during the Mahalia Day holiday week. I expect you to be ready at eight o'clock in an hour's time frame. You're to wait outside for us on the porch. I expect that traffic is going to be quite backed up taking more than an hour's time frame to get to West Alia. People are reportedly according to the local news, starting their holiday today, a day early, to copy the King to do it. So move it with getting ready now." 
He didn't comment a response darted inside the apartment shutting both doors. Guardian went to hit the bathroom tossing aside his clothes onto the sink counter and showered thoroughly as he could. He then dried himself then went into the bedroom carrying his clothes he put on the bed leaving it unmade. He took out a pair of underwear, a pair of jeans and a dressy t-shirt in color blue along with putting on his socks and sneakers. That despite not wearing socks with his shoes. He grabbed his keys hooking them onto the hook on his jeans. Guardian then went into the kitchen to cook a microwave meal. 
That was due to thinking "It'll be hours before my next meal." 
He ate after the microwave finished cooked. 
He drank the rest of his milk and thought "I better go buy some more once I get the chance." 
He went to the couch's dresser drawer and yanked out the paper involving the Visser and Law Associates' group. Guardian wound up folding the paper as many times as he could before putting it in his front pocket. He found his wrist watch still attached to his wrist and eyed it to see it was waterproof. 
He thought to himself "I recalled showering while wearing the wristwatch forgetting to take it off. Lucky I the wristwatch still working by the looks of it." 
He eyed the time finding that he had almost thirty minutes to show up on the porch. He went to the TV and turned it on to the local news' channel he watched last night. Guardian waited for the weather report. 
Only to find them talking "There's a female scam artist named Anna Kremenova going around as the Queen's second daughter. Anna Kremenova was heavily spied on and investigated as ordered by the King. The spying was to catch her in the act in doing something lawbreaking just so there'll be an excuse of arresting her. There was such a lawbreaking act was caught on recorder and Anna Kremenova was arrested and charged." 
He frowned listening to the news talking "Kevin Oran turned himself in Merryville's police station early this morning. This happened after the arrest of Anna Kremenova his ex-wife was broadcasted as breaking news last night during our eleven o'clock broadcast." 
Guardian sighed and eyed the time on his wristwatch and figured "I'll go out and wait for Rita and Olivia to arrive while waiting on the porch." 
He turned off the TV and left the apartment locking the door and went around the house going to the front porch to sit. Guardian found Rita there in a lawn chair reading her familiar book.
Rita spoke not looking up to see him "Olivia will be along soon once she's sure she has everything she needs for the long drive."
He frowned but wordlessly sat down on the lawn chair to see a big tote bag next to Rita's chair. Rita continued reading which he sat lengthy while eyeing his watch to find ten minutes to eight o'clock arrived. He heard the front door banged shut which he looked to see Olivia locking the door with a key. Guardian watched as Olivia put the key into her large tote bag.
She speaking "Ma, I'm ready so let's get this over with now." 
He got up and eyed Rita who put aside her book in the tote bag and hauled it to one of the sedans. He saw was a family wagon by its size and saw her get inside the driver's seat. 
He frowned as Olivia ordered "You're to get in the passenger's seat in the front. I'm sitting in the back seat. Not much room to accommodate this bowling ball." 
She he saw got inside in the back seat which he obeyed to sit in the front buckling up his seatbelt. Guardian stared out the window as Rita started up the car by giving verbal commands to it. He eyed scenery out the window as Rita backed the car out of the driveway driving it through Dorrance Street to get to Main Street and driving a route to the highway. Guardian kept his eyes out the window hearing silence from both women. He looked to see Rita appeared to be concentrating on driving by her glaring expression. He saw Olivia he peered at behind him was busy reading a book from the cover's title involved pregnancies and babies' first year after being born. He sighed and resumed staring out the window till traffic got bumper to bumper. 
He heard Rita give off "Bloody Hades, exit off's ahead but this traffic isn't letting me through to get off as fast as I wanted. Its going to take a bit before I reach the exit to get off." 
He kept his eyes onto the traffic ahead of him to find a police car parked in a lane leading towards a roadway ramp. 
Guardian heard from Rita again "Bloody Hades, the accident is on the exit route. I have to take another route to get to West Alia. This is going to take awhile." 
He heard nothing from Olivia only glanced at her to see she was still reading her book. Guardian saw that Olivia had appeared to have gotten further into the book by the amount of pages. He frowned inwardly to eye out the window as the traffic bumper to bumper went pass the exit ramp and resumed its slow crawl. Then they reached another exit ramp which he found Rita slowly driving the car onto it following bumper to bumper other cars with others following behind them. Guardian sighed again as Rita got the car down the ramp to an intersection which he saw a town name for Merryville. The name making him grimace and recognized some of the buildings spared of the spinner storm in vicinity. He continued to grimace as Rita drove the car through Merryville even passed the Trick's new building on the main road. She, he saw was taking back roads passed farms saying town names in some of them. Guardian then felt relieved to see West Alia's town name as they entered the city. He finding the town's looks was twin to Cairo judging by the looks of it as Rita parked the car in a lot of a major grocery store chain.
He sighed as Rita spoke loudly "Ok Olivia we're here in West Alia in front of the grocery store. I figured that they must have a bathroom for you so get out and see about that." 
He twisted to find Olivia unbuckling her seatbelt and getting out of the car hauling her bag. Guardian noticed her stuffing her book into the bag on the way and walking in a fast move towards the grocery store while avoiding cars in the vicinity. 
He frowned as he eyed Rita who spoke "A pity that the baby has settled on her bladder making her wants to go to the bathroom too many times. She can't seem to get rid of that feeling. Olivia can't seem to get the baby to move out of position hence she dubbing it bowling ball. Its position is that the baby is nearly in position for birth which will happen once it's obvious that she's finished carrying it." 
He frowned eyeing Rita to speak "How far along is she actually?"
Guardian frowned as Rita spoke looking at him "Olivia's predicted to be due in two weeks actually despite the doctor unsure of when's she's due. Olivia reportedly found out too late that she was pregnant hence the doctor unsure of when her due date is. She's reportedly predicted to have a week to go before she falls into the sleeping coma for pregnant women to undergo in their last week of pregnancy. This happens before they wake up and give birth to the baby naturally."
He spoke "Oh which gender is it actually?"
He frowned as Rita spoke "Actually sonar sound tests haven't been accurate on pinpointing the gender. The sonar sound has been having problems with scanning for the baby's gender like what happens to any woman pregnant. So the baby's gender will be a surprise once she has the baby on which one it'll be. Olivia is hoping for a girl wanting to pass down Irina a name on my side of the family that came from Lavinia one of nations in the Republics' of Tsar during the rebellion of the natives of Romany. My ancestors escaped being blackmailed into fighting in that war and came to Mahalia for sanctuary and haven't left since. Don't you dare mention that to anyone or whoever asks about me?! 
There's one descendant family left from that war that are still carrying on that blackmail scheme according to contacts in Lavinia. They blame my family for the Romany losing the war to the Tsarina at the time and her forces. That family has reportedly put out some high death bounty on descendants of my ancestors with heads of the person's body brought to that family with proof of them being a descendant documented." 
He spoke as Rita gave him a glare "I'll keep my mouth shut as you wish." 
Guardian frowned as Rita spoke again still glaring at him "Actually I'm sharing this with you. I'm still awaiting test results on a lump taken out of my breast. I warn you that breast cancer as its called has taken out two sisters, both siblings of mine that were older than me. I don't have anyone else other than my daughter Olivia to hold my hand while I fight this situation if it turns out to be cancer. My sisters' two children each have indicated through contact via mail that they immigrated to elsewhere. There's no knowledge of where they went included in their last letter they sent me. I haven't received any letters since but postcards addressed to my post office address with no writing included in them. All the postcards have come from the Columbia continent that seemed like their living all over the place. This has happened six months every week till they stopped coming is which is when it was during winter season here. I haven't received another postcard since. I would love to find out what's going on with the postcards or if my nephews and nieces are safe for now." 
He frowned to give her a head bob as Rita added groaning loudly "Looks like the grocery store included books Olivia carrying a bag in hand."
He looked to see Olivia come into view with a paper bag in hand that appeared to look heavy as he heard from Rita "Olivia inherited my love of books and always buys dozens of them if any store is selling them period." 
Guardian didn't comment a response as Olivia got to the car and got inside. He peered at her she ignoring him looking. 
Olivia he spied spoke while buckling on her seatbelt "Victoria bank, Ma and step on it. Mister Beers has business there." 
He stopped his peering to look out the window as Rita started up the car and drove out of the parking lot. Guardian saw Rita wound up driving to the Victoria bank he finding it a building separated from other buildings and didn't look impressive towards him. 
He frowned as Rita parked in the lot and spoke "Here you go Mister Beers."
Guardian got out of the car and went inside the bank to wait in line. Once it was his turn he showed the teller the letter that narrowed her eyes. 
The teller spoke "Proof of ID to prove this transfer?"
He groaned and spoke "Do I need an ID card for this? I wasn't made aware of needing one for this." 
He frowned as the bank teller handed him the letter and spoke "Get an ID card shown and I'll make the transfer." 
Guardian walked out fuming "I'm furious to hearing that from the teller." 
Guardian wound up getting inside Rita's car and spoken to her clearing her throat "I need an ID card to prove my business with the bank. I don't have an ID card at the moment and would need to get one as soon as possible." 
He heard from Olivia "Hit the Motor Vehicle building Ma. See if he can get one from there." 
Guardian didn't say a word as Rita started the car and drove it to the Motor Vehicle building.
Rita spoke towards him once parked "I warn you that the lines for ID are going to be lengthy. That's teenagers trying to get drivers' licenses once they turn sixteen despite no experience with driving yet." 
He didn't say a word instead walked inside. Guardian walked out two hours later carrying his ID card in his side pocket.
Guardian spoke towards Rita once in the car "I got the ID card but it's for not driving a car. I don't have any driving school education or experience with a car to drive or to do this." 
Guardian eyed Rita who gave up a disgust sound and drove the car back to Victoria bank. He walked inside to stand in line and waited as his turn was called to feel relieved to get a different bank officer this time. Guardian got a young male which he wordlessly handed the ID card and letter to the man. He frowned seeing a big frown form on the male's face who picked up the phone and had a whispered talk on it words not heard.
The male put the phone down and cleared his throat speaking "This is going to take a bit before I get this cleared. So please go sit and wait till one of us comes up to you and tells you everything is in order."
He obeyed after handed back his ID which he pocketed. Guardian found an armchair in the room which he sat down eyes onto the bank tellers processing people. He glanced at the doorway to spot two cops come into the bank he groaning loudly. 
Guardian thought to himself "The bank teller has called the cops instead of doing my bank request as requested." 
The cops he saw were seen going into the manager's office going inside before walking out one pocketing a piece of paper. They were seen heading towards him while pulling out handcuffs in a beeline. Guardian groaned softly as the cops arrived at him and arrested him along with proceeding to pat him down and reading him his rights. Then they wound up pushing him and yanking him outside to the cop car parked out there. He looked out the window to spot Rita's car parked in the vicinity along with her in the car looking annoyed to seeing him arrested. The cops drove the car to the police precinct which he was brought inside and fingerprinted along with picture taken. Guardian felt annoyance take hold as he was then brought to a jail cell and freed from handcuffs and pushed inside. Guardian went to the bed and sat seemingly lengthy while glancing out the window to find nighttime had arrived. 
A female cop arrived and ordered "You out! You're to follow me!" 
He obeyed. 
Guardian followed the female going to the front of the precinct to find Rita's car parked on the curb and ordered "You get inside now!" 
Guardian obeyed after handed back his ID card and his keys and not his paper for the bank transfer to his annoyance. 
He heard Rita give up "Bloody Hades towards bank tellers for not being smart!" 
Rita he saw drove the car away instead of commenting anything further.
He frowned to speak loudly as she drove the car through the town "What's going on with the arrest anyway?"
He heard from Olivia loudly "Actually the Victoria bank thought you were trying to scam them out of money. Hence they were having you arrested and thrown in jail instead of consulting the group that authorized the transfer in the first place. Your money has been transferred as authorized after Ma went inside the bank to tell off the bank teller on that scam joke. She tells me she told them to consult the group that had authorized the transfer. It took two hours of waiting for the bank to do what she told them, stalling on not doing it at first. Then they actually did that and found out it wasn’t a scam but actual fact. Anyway the police took too long to release you from their clutches. They were trying to run a background check onto you in case you were actually a criminal. You weren't but they released you anyway." 
He didn't comment a response got a tap on his shoulder looked at Olivia who thrust him a fast food diner labeled bag smelling of food making his stomach rumble. He took and gobbled up the cheeseburger and fries and gulped down the milk. Guardian feeling himself ravenous which he sighed once done. He leaned back in the seat and eyed out the window finding it open and found the night air seemed cool instead of warm. He kept an eye out as Rita drove the car to Beach City while meeting less traffic on the way. They pulled into the driveway of the house. 
He groaned of relief to get out hearing Olivia speaking "Guard, dump that food bag into the garbage on your way to the apartment. We're getting inside by the front door." 
He didn't comment a response obeyed to dump the bag in the garbage. Guardian took the yard route to his apartment finding the light over the door turn on illuminating the pale moonlight to his relief. He found a masked Coon in the yard near the steps that darted away. He went down the steps finding nothing amiss with them. Guardian let himself inside the apartment locking both doors behind him along with turning on the living room lights to eye his apartment finding nothing amiss in it. He sighed and went into his bedroom stripping himself of his clothes and put on his designated pajama shorts. He seeing the time was around midnight. He sighed and laid his form down on the bed stomach on it and shut his eyes passing out unconscious.

Guardian came to come to hearing a doorbell ringing quite loudly. He woke up eyeing the time seeing it was eight o'clock in the morning. Groaning he rolled over again hearing the doorbell finding it came from the laundry room. He got up and went to the door yanking it open to stare at Rita with an annoyed expression on his face. 
Rita he glared at spoke "Excuse me but the back yard needs some work done. Such as trees and bushes need to be trimmed. The weather reporters have made up their minds and said that we'll be hit with a rainstorm. That prediction is said despite claiming that their computer models all over the place so get on with the yard work now." 
He slammed the door in response only to hear the doorbell ringing yanked it opens to find Rita still there. 
She gave him a glare who spoke "Don't give Olivia an excuse to kick you out. That's from your still not on your feet yet." 
He didn't say a word instead gave a head bob in response and shut the door gently locking it. Guardian went to his clothes exchanging for a tank top and shorts and put on his socks and sneakers. He went to the kitchen to eat a meal finding he had two days supply of meals left. He groaned and without a comment walked out of the apartment leaving the doors unlocked but shut. He went to the shed and got to work clipping the bushes and the trees in vicinity. As well as he could think that would cause havoc if they broke off to fly around by the winds a rainstorm would bring. He once done went around the fenced yard examining it for anything involving Coons to find a freshly dug hole. Guardian filled it back in with dirt and rocks he found littering another area of the yard. He sighed once done to go back inside his apartment to lock the doors. Guardian went into the bathroom to shower after removing his clothes. He showered thoroughly then dried himself. Guardian then walked into his bedroom to pick out a fresh pair of underwear, socks, shorts and a t-shirt having Beach City labeled it. He picked up his keys from the dresser in the living room hooking it to his shorts. Guardian went to the refrigerator to find himself thirsty which he gulped down the rest of his milk. He finding himself finishing the milk and tossed it in the garbage can. He put on his sneakers and walked out of the apartment to meet Olivia coming into view that did a double take look seeing him. 
He spoke to her "Excuse me. I was on my way to Terrio store to grocery shop for some food. What else can I do for you hmm?"
He eyed Olivia who frowned and spoke "I was coming by to tell you this. My Ma is going to the Terrio store on my asking. It's by driving me. I came to see if you wanted to come along." 
He spoke "Fine, I'll come along. At least I can stock up on groceries. I don't have to worry about hauling them home. The food wound up getting bad from the summer weather."
Guardian eyed Olivia who spoke "Fine go to the porch and wait for us there. I need to get my purse ready." 
He didn't comment a response followed Olivia out of the yard to see her go inside the side entrance. He went to the porch and sat in a lawn chair eyes on the forest seemingly lengthy. Guardian felt his familiar senses blare warning abruptly that alerted him of someone watching him from a hiding spot. He looked around with his eyes finding no one in the vicinity. Guardian looked off his left on the sidewalk to find no one there. He felt drawn to look at below Rita's car to spot a pair of cat's eyes sitting there. He groaned and got up going to the car kneeling to peer underneath. Guardian found the cat had darted out and was on the sidewalk he saw was all orange colored. He went to the cat that darted away across the street going into the forest. Guardian resumed going to sit down on the lawn chair to again get his senses of being watched blared again. He eyed the cars to sense the watcher wasn't there but from the forest. He figured the watching came from the cat watching him. Guardian eyed the forest warily as the front door banged was heard which he got up seeing Rita walk out alone looking upset. 
Guardian spoke "Olivia, what's going on with her?"
Guardian eyed Rita who spoke after shaking her head in a no gesture "I have to call the hospital to send someone to monitor Olivia. I found her lying on the bed unresponsive to my noises. I figured that she's fallen into the coma related to her pregnancy. Excuse me. She can't be moved her sleeping status would kill her or the baby if she's moved. I'm afraid our trip to Terrio will have to wait while I go call the hospital. Excuse me again." 
He watched her go inside which he resumed sitting in the lawn chair. Guardian again feel the familiar watching sensation as sirens were heard loudly followed by an emergency vehicle arriving parking itself at the curb. Guardian saw a male wearing a doctor's uniform came out of the van's back carrying a bag and going up to him that formed a shocked expression on his face before composing himself.
The male spoke sounding firm "Olivia Madison, where is she?"
He spoke "Excuse me." 
Guardian went to the door and rang the doorbell repeatedly till Rita arrive looking upset. He jabbed a finger aimed at the doctor he assumed was the male. 
Rita spoke "Excuse me for not being outside waiting for you. I'll lead you in to attend to my daughter." 
He watched as the doctor walked inside the house following Rita as the emergency vehicle he saw drove off with sirens stopping. Guardian again got the familiar watching sense blaring to peer at the forest again to see nothing out of ordinary. He sighed and figured that he'll go shop for some food at the Seaman grocery store. He found Rita walking out sobbing loudly and going to sit at a lawn chair still crying away while burying her face into a handkerchief. He eyed Rita who kept her crying seemingly lengthy before she cleared her throat and rubbed her watery eyes with the cloth. 
She looked at him before speaking "Sorry just lost it. My daughter is currently in the coma related to her pregnancy at the moment. The doctor will be staying with me to monitor Olivia till its obvious time for the baby to be born. The doctor calling himself Hammad Ashar says that the baby's birth can happen in a week's time frame. He claims that by judging by his scans on his medical devices. He's not sure of how long Olivia will be in her coma for the baby to be born. 
Doctor Ashar warns me ‘Your daughter's coma might be permanent with the baby pushed out naturally by her own body doing it. She,’ he claims, ‘will be remaining asleep for an unknown time period.’ 
He did say ‘It has taken some women about six lunar cycled months the earliest for them to wake up from their coma once they already birthed the baby.’ 
He's not sure of the long term actually. Oh well."
Guardian sighed and spoke "Do you want me to stay home and hang around or go do something?"
He eyed Rita who spoke "Guard, just go do something and leave me to my thoughts now. Go take a walk if you want but make it a lengthy walk. I like to be alone for awhile." 
He didn't comment a response to Rita using his first name as he got up and walked off the porch. 
Guardian wound up going to the sidewalk thinking "I'll go to Seaman's grocery store to buy some groceries how short the walk it was to there." 
He found his feet as if compelled leading him to the bridge to Terrio while feeling senses blaring warning unexpectedly. Guardian found nothing to his mind to explain the compulsion. He felt himself annoyed as the compulsion stopped walking to again feel the compulsion to go into the store. Guardian obeyed to wander around the store exploring it entirely to find it was partially a grocery store. 
He grabbed a cart and went to get some groceries thinking "I'll buy some for three days supply." 
He found himself nearly overfilling the cart to his annoyance as if compelled. Guardian grabbing random items from the aisles he finding some of the food had nothing to do with his eating habits. He finding the food seemed for adults on a bad diet. He again found himself going to the cashier buying the food and lugging the cloth bags. By five a hand by handles up the bridge's stairs himself finding he had to rest repeatedly. He reached the top and walked across the bridge reaching the stairs down. Guardian lugged the bags to the house and rang the doorbell as if compelled. Guardian found the senses quit their blaring to his relief.
He thinking to himself "Some ghostly spirit took hold of me to buy food for the doctor and Rita with myself." 
He eyed the bags on the porch resting his arms as Rita arrived gasping loudly seeing him and the bags of food. 
He spoke "Bought out what I think you ate and the doctor eats as well. That including what I eat."
Guardian got no response from Rita who held open the door and gestured him to go inside which he obeyed. He finding a living room having a fireplace and a set of stairs going up on his left and eyed her. She led him to the kitchen through the living room to the dining room he saw appeared to be a bedroom having Olivia on the bed asleep. Guardian saw the doctor nearby seated reading a book that appeared to have a night sky on its cover. He followed Rita into the large kitchen to find a door leading towards outside on the side of the house.
She spoke "I'll help you take what you eat into a bag for you, so excuse me, while I go get it." 
He eyed her after putting the bags on the floor as she opened a bottom cupboard and yanked out a cloth bag appearing to be on the large side. She handed the bag towards him which he proceeded to take out his nourishment stuffing it into it. Rita, he saw stood watching him doing it. He found that he had two days worth of nourishment supply. He took the bag full of food out the side entrance. Guardian went into the yard going to his apartment to find a cat seated on the top steps. The cat looked like the gonoid he saw hiding underneath Rita's car that was washing its paw and bringing it to its ear. 
He thinking "Cat's bathing itself. I wonder where it came from anyway." 
He frowned eyeing the cat that stopped its bath to look at him before darting into the bushes in the yard out of sight. He sighed and went inside the apartment after manipulating the doors and locking it behind him. Guardian went to the kitchen and put away the nourishment. He felt himself terribly hungry got out a microwave meal and cooked it thoroughly then gobbled it up along with drinking from the milk carton. He felt himself tired went to the couch and leaned back shutting his eyes passing out to come to hearing the doorbell ringing. It's ringing sounding of coming from the laundry room. Guardian got up and went to there to find Rita there looking like she was shocked judging by the expression on her face. 
He stared at her as Rita spoke "Guard, how did you know what foods to buy for both me and the doctor? You got everything on our lists."
He sighed and spoke "I don't think you're going to believe me. I went to Terrio as if compelled. I wound up getting nourishment as if possessed by some spirit on what to buy. This possession stopped once I was at your residence to ring the doorbell." 
He kept the frown while eyeing Rita who sighed loudly.
She, he heard, spoke "I think it was a sign from Olivia saying that she'll be alright. I asked for a sign from Olivia. Just after you left just to show that she'll be alright from her coma. I think she's going to be fine so I can rest easy from that." 
Guardian didn't comment a response as Rita hugged him abruptly before letting go of him. He saw her go up the stairs which he shut the door to his apartment locking it. He went to the living room to sit turning on the TV. 
Guardian figured to he "It's time for the local news' broadcasts from glancing at my watch seeing it was noon." 
He sat eyeing the TV after turning it on with a remote. 
Guardian found the news' reporters declaring "The upcoming predicted rain is actually going to be a rainstorm predicted to hit Southwestern Mahalia. We aren't sure of the severity of the rainstorm it'll be or whether it'll involve a thunderstorm or anything worse than that." 
He groaned hearing the news' talk on that. 
They, he heard, started broadcasting local state news talking "Anna Kremenova has a court appearance for scamming people out of their money today. The cops have reportedly said they have a confession from her being the mastermind instead of her ex-husband. The ex-husband was pointed as the one doing this scamming. His crime is being obsessed in wanting her as his. Kevin Oran was said to assaulting her if she didn't agree with his demands of mating which she had some injuries from it as reported." 
He continued to listen to the news started talking "It's reportedly rumored the King's grandson is in some children's hospital having surgery for a heart condition." 
Guardian heard them mention "There's another rumor saying that it was actually tests for an undiagnosed medical condition. That involved his growth and responses to stimulation around him being slow and not acknowledged for a three month old." 
He sighed again hearing that as the news continued "It's rumored that the three month old still not shown to the public and unnamed to this day's Mother Olga is her name was drinking alcoholic drinks during her pregnancy. That was an addiction which caused side effects to the baby while she carried him hence he at the hospital getting checked out along with the medical issues fixed up."
Guardian groaned to felt a compulsion to walk out of the apartment. He found himself doing it after shutting off the TV and locking his doors with his keys. Guardian found himself going to the mailbox to the one labeled basement to find a postcard from Elizabethan Island nation where his Father's private island was. 
It included with wording on it saying "Hit the town's green's gazebo immediately once receiving this. Bring this with you. Excuse the smokers there." 
He obeyed finding the town's green was across the street from Seaman's grocery store. Guardian found the gazebo in the middle of the greenery area had one smoker an older male wearing a blue business suit with a blue tie and a white top peeking out smoking away. He went to sit down inside the gazebo next to the male who gave off a cough sound.
The smoker speaking "Sorry, I can't quit this habit. It's from being very stressed out about the affairs of your Father actually."
Guardian didn't comment a response spoke "Local news is blaring all sorts of junk about my nephew having medical issues. What's going on?"
He eyed the male he saw was his Father's hidden representative given up the name of Warwick to him at meetings.
Warwick spoke after a puff of smoking "Your sister reportedly drank during her pregnancy. That despite attempts by your parents to get her to stop an addiction habit caused her son to be born with some facial deformed status. The doctor told your Father to wait till it was obvious he was strong enough to withstand the surgery and its drugs related to it. The nephew is currently having that surgery done now. Your Father wasn't willing to wait for him to be declared fit enough to survive it. Stubborn man anyway." 
Guardian frowned hearing that from Warwick as he spoke "The leaked rumors going around as broadcasted by the news?"
He eyed Warwick who went to the trash can's ash tray stubbing out the cigarette and went back to sitting next to him.
Warwick spoke "The leaked news was based by someone who reportedly had some angry feeling towards your sister for some kind of rejection done. This someone was pointed out as currently the one doing the leaks at the moment that has been caught doing it. Leaks been plugged for now. Your Father I believe will be addressing those rumors once the holiday week is over with once officials are back to meet again."
He spoke "You know of anyone having people spying on me at my residence?"
He eyed Warwick that chuckle a soft laugh and then spoke "Like Father like son. You appeared to have inherited what makes your Father seemingly knowing whenever someone is spying onto him from some hidden status. That spying was put in place to see if you would get the communication for a meeting. So I would be there waiting for you. I've been waiting for several hours for your arrival actually. I have nothing else to report. Other than telling you that your Father hates the legal name your Mother raiser used to hide you from the public. She was reportedly trying to communicate about you to him repeatedly over the years with communication ignored."
Guardian spoke as Warwick got up from the bench "What about my other sister hiding somewhere? Any chance I could meet her?"
Guardian eyed Warwick who cleared his throat and spoke "That sister in question is currently living in your residence. We're unsure if she knows about you or her Mother raiser knows either. Good day sir." 
Guardian felt himself shocked with Warwick's words as the male walked out of the gazebo out of his line of sight. He sat frowning staring at the gazebo's wooden floor till footsteps sounded on there. Guardian looked up to find two teenagers a male and a female get inside acting like they didn't see him and get kissy faced by kissing each other on the lips repeatedly making him upset with that. 
Guardian mentally thought to himself "Can't I have someone to be paired with out of loneliness?"
He recalled himself "I kept trying to date Trudy out of loneliness who told me 'Sorry I just got out of a divorce. I'm not looking for anyone at the moment. I'll let you know when I'm ready to date.'"
Guardian recalled fully "Trudy till the house's bombing by the firemen always brought up her divorce comment as a way of rejecting my efforts to date her every time. It always annoyed me when she didn't object to me spying onto her getting out of her car from working a night shift to get inside the building. I recalled always hearing Trudy giving off a faint giggling sound each time she sensed me staring at her." 
Guardian got a glare from the male teen as he broke off his thoughts. He sighed as the teens broke off their kissing and jabbed fingers aimed at him and towards the gazebo's entrance. They he saw were giving him glaring expressions. He groaned softly still glared at and quietly walked out of the gazebo going to Olivia's house to find Rita again on the porch seated reading her familiar book. 
He went to the lawn chair and cleared his throat speaking loudly "How's Olivia doing anyway?"
He eyed Rita who looked up from reading with a finger marking where she was on the page who spoke "She's still the same with no change at the moment. The doctor says it'll take a full week's time before any changes will be noticed. Enough on his scanners to register when it's time for the baby to be born or she safe to wake up by medically means for manipulating her to the hospital. He still wants to stay with her in case the baby comes out by itself. He claims to have cases of that happening before and the Mother waking up from the birth a week later by medicinal use." 
Guardian groaned loudly hearing Rita's words as she added "Yes I felt impatience for this to get over with hence I outside reading my book. Its helping me with my mood it’s a very good book at the moment, excuse me." 
He eyed Rita who resumed reading her book. He looked away finding the watching sense stopped. Guardian found the familiar cat on the sidewalk in view washing its tail from the looks of it. He eyed the cat to see it was entirely orange colored with a pink nose and yellow eyes. Guardian frowned eyeing the cat that continued its bath till it stopped to stare at him back. He looked down edging his face to face the ground while adjusting his eyes to again eye the cat. The cat resumed its licking before getting onto the ground and rubbing its back on the sidewalk and stretching full length. 
He figured "The cat's a male judging by what I saw indicating its male status." 
He eyed the cat he figured "I'll call him Greenie for finding it underneath Rita's green family wagon vehicle." 
He eyed Greenie that stopped his stretching and back rubbing on the sidewalk. He watched as Greenie got up darting across the street going through the break of the fence and out of sight through the bushes. Guardian sighed and eyed Rita that was still reading her book. Guardian eyed his watch finding it was still mid afternoon at the moment as the sunlight become dimmer. Guardian got up and looked at the sky finding the clouds were scattering in the sky and repeatedly covering the sun as they traveled blown by the wind. He sighed finding that they appeared to look white not indicating of rain to him to his relief. 
Guardian without a comment towards Rita figured "I'll go back to the town's stores. I figured that I'll find a bookstore to find something worth reading. I aim to try the Terrio store if there weren't any good books to be bought." 
He left Rita reading her book and dumped the postcard into the trash can after ripping it up fully. Then after that walked to the town checking out stores fully finding some were involving restaurants and themed restaurant food such as ice cream but didn't find a bookstore. He sighed and eyed the sky finding the sun was low. Guardian found the time on his watch indicate it was near his dinnertime. 
He thought "It's near dinnertime for me. I'll go to Terrio the next day." 
He walked home in a fast speed walk not wanting to miss his dinnertime. Guardian arrived at the house to find Rita gone from the porch but the front door was shut along with the screen door. He went to the yard to again find Greenie sitting on his haunches at the top steps. The cat gave off a meow sound before darting away into the bushes out of sight. He sighed and figured that Greenie must have gotten inside through the Coon's digging entrance. Guardian finding the hole was again dug and big enough for a cat to get through. Guardian groaned and without a comment went inside the apartment to hear the doorbell to the laundry room's door go off. He locked the door and deposed his keys and darted through to the bedroom going to the door yanking it open. 
Guardian frowned seeing Rita there that spoke "Have you seen this orange male cat dubbed Bob hanging around the house's grounds?"
He spoke "I saw Bob in the yard that went to hide in the bushes. Is he yours?"
Guardian eyed Rita who spoke "Actually Bob belongs to the town's Mayor's Mother. She habitually let's him out for the day and then brought inside for the night. He hasn't been seen around her home at night very much hence she a little worried about him. There's signs of crocogators have been seen near the beach of the lake which this forest is bordering it."
He sighed and spoke as Rita stopped talking to frown "Fence has a hole indicating it's big enough for a cat to crawl underneath it. It was originally made by a coon I caught in the yard before it scampered off. I managed to fill in the hole. Bob as he's called must have dug the hole big enough to get access to the yard. Hence I keep seeing him at the top steps leading to the apartment."
Guardian stopped talking to frown as Rita spoke "Interesting that he's hanging around here. The Mayor Kim Lords has reportedly found signs of dogs loose in her neighborhood. She keeps seeing them unleashed by their owners while out walking at various hours of the day and night. That's whenever she's out walking with her own dog leashed. She's not happy that the town's people are ignoring an ordinance of having dogs' leashed period. 
The Mayor has gone up to the people to say ‘I’m telling you of that rule.’ who admit ‘We’re being out of town visiting for the Mahalia Day holiday week.’ 
They also claim ‘We don't know of the rule.’ 
She keeps finding those people have appeared to ignore her lectures of leashing their dogs. Them repeatedly seen letting their dogs wander without a leash on. Besides I figured out why Bob is nesting in the backyard. It's to avoid those wandering dogs. Missus Lords caught a couple having trapped a cat in a tree with their dog off leash barking at it. The couple not doing anything to call off their dog from scaring that trapped cat in question. Missus Lords had to call the cops to get the couple fined some two hundred dollar amount for having the dog off leash. That along with calling gonoid control to get the cat out of the tree that is currently at the pound awaiting adoption in Georgina."
He spoke "I'm surprised that Missus Lords didn't adopt the cat herself or have her Mother keep it." 
He frowned as Rita sighed loudly before speaking "Missus Lords in question has a young son that is allergic to cats. He's not so allergic to dogs hence they having a dog as a pet. Missus Lords' Mother could have adopted the cat but she has fears of adopting too many cats. This adoption would cause her to hoard the cats seeing that from her own Mother when she was being raised. This caused her Mother to be institutionalized and later died in the asylum. Missus Lords' Mother known as Granny Kim currently lives in a bungalow house on Walnut Street that is near the beach. Her house is no kidding is near a beach that isn't known to have crocogators in it. It's the beach being too used by tourists and visitors to the town of Beach City too much. Those gonoids have been scared off from using that area as their home. Besides I'll go call Granny Kim and tell her about Bob seen around the house's grounds. So she can rest and maybe visit to see that he's doing fine, excuse me."
He watched her leave which he shut the door locking it and thought “I should leave the door unlocked in case of emergency.” 
He proceeded to do feeling himself hungry went into the kitchen to cook a microwave meal.
Guardian thought to himself "I'm feeling annoyed at not able to cook via stove my omelet breakfast food I normally ate every day. I figuring out that the microwave wasn't able to cook one for me despite multiple attempts of this." 
He quit his thoughts once the microwave dinged loudly. He again ate the meal from the tray not caring that it was burning his tongue. Then threw out the tray into the garbage bin finding it wasn't full enough for throwing out. Guardian again went to the refrigerator and gulped milk from the carton multiple gulps till he felt his thirst satisfied. He then put the milk away and went to the TV to turn it on. Guardian eyed the TV to find the local news' broadcast was on. He eyed the time finding it was five thirty in the evening. 
He watched the local news to hear them mention "The King has confirmed to address the rumors involving his grandson. The confirmation is said to be done once the Mahalia Day week holiday was over and government officials back in session at a public meeting of parliament gathering together." 
He continued to watch the local news blaring "We're reporting another vampire spider infestation was found in Cairo in an empty boarded up house by a homeless drunk. The drunkard wound up going inside and getting sucked who managed to escape the sucking to get outside. The male wound up getting medical help for the blood loss by a passing car finding the drunk lying on the street with spiders on him still sucking away. The male once waken told the people of what he found in the house who had the firefighters come to it to confirm the infestation and burned it to the ground. The reported house's owners reportedly away on a lengthy vacation compensated for the loss of their home." 
He grimace hearing the news of the infestation. 
He heard "The firefighters managed to capture the spiders' Mother. By one of own dogs catching the gonoid in his mouth out of the grass as the house was being burned. They currently have the vampire spider's Mother sent to a test lab for veterinarians to work on eliminating the vampirism from the species. So it'll have young that will be harmless to manoids and gonoids and only target the insects as its food source. This is from a huge Quito problem of the insect only targeting humanoids for feeding out at night time during summer months. Hence there spraying of poison at the dead of the night just to cut down on the Quito population." 
He sighed and continued to watch the local news' report talking "We declare the predicted rain hitting the southwestern part of Mahalia will be turning out to be a tropical storm. It already had stormed over the ocean reef park area dubbed Marauder's reef. We wound up predicting the tropical storm to be a spinner storm. It was how violent it was over the ocean while it made its way towards land."
He kept watching the local news's weather reporter "We are predicting a path for the storm to hit land. It'll make landfall to hit the West Allied state area before traveling on land to other states. The spinner storm as predicted is to take a traveling path over land to the northeastern part of the continent nation before reaching the ocean and traveling elsewhere." 
Guardian frowned as the local weather kept on blaring "The storm is predicted to hit at noon the next day. We're not sure if it'll become a spinner or remain a rainstorm instead." 
He sighed and heard the doorbell ringing. 
He figured "It's got to be from the laundry room. I guess I'll shut off the TV and go see what's going on."
He went to the door yanking it open to find Rita there.
Rita spoke "I need your help with putting inside some things that are outside the house the predicted storm hitting. The doctor can't help me with this chore needing to monitor Olivia. Plus keep an eye on her in case of the baby gets born abruptly. He is claiming that storms such as this has resulted in multiple women birthing their babies while their in their comas and waking up once the storm's over."
Guardian sighed and stepped into the laundry room speaking "What do you have in mind for getting stored away?"
Guardian eyed Rita who made a come gesture which he obeyed. Guardian followed her up the stairs to find the doorway led to the hallway to the kitchen. 
He heard from her as she led the way to the porch "I need those lawn chairs inside along with assistance in getting some potted plants inside too." 
Guardian obeyed putting in the living room the three lawn chairs.
He thinking "I'm finding that they weren't bendable. They were made out of a hard material to keep them in position." 
Guardian walked out finding Rita coming from the left side of the porch hauling two big potted plants in her hands. He took her hint from her throat clearing noises and grabbed potted plants one for each hand to haul them inside the house. Guardian wound up following Rita's example of leaving the plants piled in the living room as the female did the same. 
He eyed the plants to think "I found the potted plants seemed to indicate herbs to me judging by the looks of them. I was recalling herb work by Ms. Lyons teaching me. The teaching wound up involving psychic abilities and use of herbs. I'm figuring out that I haven't been faithful in practicing the cooking and exercises related to my mental abilities." 
He groaned softly from his thoughts once the plants were all safety inside the house to get tossed a padlock by her.
He caught and heard "Please secure the shed doors by locking them now. I don't want the storm to blow open the doors and blow everything off." 
Guardian obeyed to take his apartment route to the yard. He saw the sunlight was very dim found the shed with no difficulty. Guardian found one of the doors open along with scratching sounds coming from inside once he shut the door. He yanked open the doors wide to get a coon darting out along with Bob giving chase both darting out of sight of the bushes. Guardian peered into the shed as thoroughly as he could. He then shut the doors finding nothing to indicate a gonoid inside and padlocked them together. He went to the apartment to find Bob at the top of the steps that gave off a meow sounding in a questioning tone to him. 
He paused from walking to speak "You should be indoors Bob. There's a nasty storm coming the next day. It'll cause havoc around here." 
He eyed Bob that darted towards the fence and saw the cat get underneath the area through a hole and out of sight. 
Guardian figured "The cat is probably going to Granny Kim's for safety. I hope so on that." 
He went inside the apartment after locking both doors. 
Guardian went back to the TV turning it on catching the tail end of the broadcast "About the rainstorm Angelique as its dubbed. Angelique has already been causing damage to Marauder's reef in the oceanic area it was traveling on as it headed towards Mahalia." 
He sighed and continued to watch the local news' broadcast "We are including what the natives of West Allied state bordering the ocean was doing to prepare for the storm. We the news broadcast have footage of the natives boarding up the windows of their houses with wooden planks."
He saw footage of that including hearing from them "That footage includes long lines of cars in highways showing various people driving out of state cutting their vacation short."
Guardian saw the footage and then heard "The upcoming storm is wrecking tourist season for West Allied state. The state is dependent on the tourist season for recovering from debt of cleaning up a mess of a high powered spinner storm that left millions in currency pounds in damages in the area over a cycle ago back. The damage is still being repaired at the moment along with damages from a freak winter storm that hit earlier this cycle. The winter storm happened during the seasonal change of summer to winter. That despite the winter storm is said to not causing too much damage in other states who have easily recovered very well." 
Guardian frowned thinking "I wound up recalling the freak winter storm dubbed Alfred hitting in March as said by local news on the radio. Alfred's damage wound up causing a power outage that practically wiped out the entire state's electricity grid. That despite the state was still cleaning up damage from the spinner storm's hitting the state's main electricity grid generator in Merryville. The governor running for reelection promised that the damage wasn't bad and would be easily repaired." 
He groaned adding to his thoughts "I recalled the governor wound up later voted out of office. His opponent a female named Katia omitting last name wound up winning by a landslide two weeks after the electricity grid generator was fixed up for elections to happen. This happened after power was restored to the entire state."
He sighed recalling "I wound up spending two weeks with Ms. Lyons and Kendra at the local senior center. They having electricity from a generator and having heat to warm things up during the night hours. The senior center wound up having a policy of not letting people to sleep there which at sunrise I and the ladies would walk home to own apartments. They and I all would reportedly to sleep in bed all day warmed by multiple blankets. Then about thirty minutes after four o'clock is when I would meet the ladies and go to the senior center to eat meals there. That included along with staying up all night." 
He grimaced recalling "I and the ladies weren't the only ones in town doing that sleeping during the day and spending the night awake at the senior center. A week later we were joined by Henrietta and her daughter doing it. 
I recalled Ms. Lyons confessed to me privately 'Henrietta told me that she was staying out of state at a local hotel for having electricity. She was using her ex-husband to pay for the hotel stay he paid fully fine for a bit. He quit doing that after claiming that he was fed up with paying for no reason abruptly. He wound up insisting on wanting Henrietta to pay for herself. Hence she back at home with us and her daughter. Her ex-husband according to Henrietta has refused to have anything to do with Michaela and taking care of her. The judge at their court case gave Henrietta full custody of their daughter from what I heard from her.'"
Guardian continued to recall "I wound up not seeing Trudy during the power outage time frame. The whole two weeks there weren't any power to the apartments till after the power came back on. I figured that Trudy was home in her apartment from being outside in the morning to snow plow the driveway by finding her car parked in the street. 
She admitting to me at a chance meeting of her throwing out the garbage 'I stayed overnight at the hospital. I worked for the whole time during the power outage. It was from a shortage of staff members. We wound up attending to a surge of people hitting the hospital with various medical injuries. Some of the injuries were found to be made up just to gain entrance into the hospital for getting out of the cold and getting some heat to stay. It was from not having any warm shelters in their town areas.'"
Guardian frowned eyeing the TV recalling that Trudy added "Those people who entered the hospital to find shelter from the cold were hit with fees by the cops. The fees were some three hundred pounds' price for wasting the hospital's time of checking them out. Each time they were visiting with claims of medical maladies. Some took the message and stayed out while others kept getting hit with fees. One male a college student racked up a thousand pounds' number total. He was reportedly told by a college's professor he attended classes for to stay out of the hospital or they'll kick him out of the college on a permanent basis. This kick out status would be permanent on his college credit records from what I heard. He wound up obeying the Professor's order of staying out of the hospital or being kicked out. He managed to pay his fee without complaint from what I last heard of him from hospital workers." 
Guardian continued to watch the TV shaking his head of the memory. 
Guardian heard "The King's spokesperson was reached for a comment about the upcoming storm. It's predicted to hit the southwestern part of the nation." 
The spokesperson commented via broadcast Guardian saw "The King hopes that the damage to Mahalia won't be too terrible. West Allied state has already has too much bad luck hitting already. They don't need another disaster to hit causing them irreparable damage." 
Guardian continued to watch the TV watching the broadcast entirely "It's eight o'clock as signaled by the director yelling in my ear via radio device so sorry I have to end this." 
He grunted an annoyed sound as "This is a paid program about TV service for additional TV channels for shows airing within the state of West Allied." 
He groaned and shut off the TV only to hear the doorbell ringing. 
Guardian went to the laundry room to find Rita there that spoke "I just got off the phone with Granny Kim. Bob is back at her house inside after she found him in her flowerbox outside her window. Bob meowing to be let inside which she has him safety in. She has reportedly said to already gotten the house prepared for keeping him indoors for a lengthy time period. I also was told by Granny Kim that she aims to keep Bob indoors on a permanent basis. She plans to have Bob leashed if he wants to go outside not trusting him to wander away from her home again."
He didn't comment a response as Rita took leave of him. He went back inside the apartment shutting the door leaving it unlocked. Guardian went to the living room to practice his limber stretching exercises then swung himself up once done from being on the floor with an acrobatic move. Guardian proceeded to do his karate doing various movements of various belt levels from red to beginner's white. That including doing his drills till he felt like he had enough and quite weary. 
He eyed his wrist watch "Bloody Hades, I find the time is an hour passed the news' broadcast." 
Guardian grumbled thinking "I thought I was quite lengthy with the karate. It appears I wasn't."
Guardian went to enter the bedroom exchanging his clothes for pajama shorts omitting a top and laid his form down on the bed after turning off the lamp. Guardian shut his eyes passing out unconscious to come to hearing a faint banging sound and his alarm clock not glowing red indicated that the power was off. He followed the banging to find it came from the laundry room door. He blindly yanked open to blink his eyes from the glare of the flashlight blaring at him. 
Guardian frowned as a voice was heard "Here take this flashlight and use it while your contained in your apartment." 
He took the flashlight Rita he recognizing her voice, held up for him and again heard from her "Feel free to come up anytime to visit me. Doctor Ashar is still reporting nothing new with Olivia at the moment. I'll be staying on the couch in the living room just to be near my daughter and be near the doctor in case he needs any help with Olivia. Doctor Ashar has claimed to unable to contact the local hospice unit for backing him up. His communicator is out at the moment with nothing to indicate on when it'll turn back on. Besides the news' broadcasts got the storm time hitting the state wrong. It's not noon the next day the storm is hitting but midnight at night actually which the storm is currently hitting outside at the moment. Nothing you can do for me except go to bed so excuse me." 
He watched Rita go up the stairs carrying her flashlight and saw the light wink out by the door slamming. He shut the laundry room door and used the flashlight's glare to make his way towards the bed putting the flashlight onto the bed's dresser table. He laid his form down onto the bed and shut his eyes passing out unconscious to come too again hearing the familiar banging noises. He woke up finding his windows blaring of light dimly despite the shades down covering them. 
Guardian got up and went to the laundry room door yanking it open to find Rita that spoke "Olivia had her baby a boy a bit ago which I'm just telling you that. The doctor isn't sure of when Olivia will wake up from her coma. He managed to contact the hospice unit after three hours of no contact. Their on the way to check out the baby boy, I believe Olivia will dub Ian after her Father raiser."
He spoke as Rita paused "Father, raiser?"
He eyed Rita who groaned loudly and then spoke "Actually Olivia is adopted at birth. I didn't birth her. I adopted her from the local hospital. That was after pestering them to give me a baby I could take care of with my current husband Ian at the time. They gave me Olivia. I've raised her all her life till Ian passed away from his smoking habit causing him smoker's cancer that later killed him. Ian made a good impression onto Olivia who told me that she would name her son after him. I suspect that she'll do that." 
Guardian spoke "You want to tell me how Olivia got pregnant in the first place?"
He felt his senses blare warning unexpectedly. 
Rita spoke answering his question "That's the thing Olivia can't explain how she wound up pregnant in the first place. She claims one of the guys who she took in must have broken in and forced mated with her. She says this happened while she was down out sick with some sleeping drug to help her with a sickness. She told me of waking up with an unconscious guy in bed with her. She refuses to tell me who this guy is instead have hinted that I'm quite a blabbermouth. Hence she not was willing to telling me who he is. Olivia has claimed that I have blabbed about her getting pregnant to the town all over the place after she told me of her pregnancy. I do hope she'll wake up soon to meet her son, Ian." 
He frowned to bob his head and then followed by Rita speaking "I have to check and see if the hospital has arrived to check on Ian excuse me." 
He watched her go up the stairs which he went inside the apartment and shut the door. Guardian went back to bed laying his form down from feeling too tired to do much except sleep. He proceeded to do till a familiar doorbell blared which he got up going to the laundry room door. Guardian wound up finding Rita falling into his arms after he opened the door. 
He caught her and he held her up as she blurt sounding upset "Doctor, keeps insisting on Ian be taken to the hospital for check up. He keeps wrecking my attempts to keep him home. The hospice's people have managed to knock me out and took Ian. I'm quite dizzy from the drugged status despite knocked out asleep for awhile. Doctor Ashar has managed to apologize for drugging me. He did warn me that the dizziness would be a side effect of the drug withdrawing from me. Help me up the stairs please." 
He obeyed to get her into the living room onto the couch to find her passed out unconscious. He went to the dining room to find the doctor there seated in an armchair reading a book that looked at him doing a double take look.
The doctor he heard speaking "Ah the first born son never thought I would be meeting you. The medicine I gave Missus Madison is enough to knock her out for two hours actually." 
He realized thinking "Bloody Hades, the doctor is working for my Father from the talk and Victoria state accent used. It figures that she was implanted with her offspring." 
Guardian spoke "Talk on what's going on with my sister Olivia. She's obviously implanted to produce an acceptable offspring for my Father to use as his heir to the throne." 
He glared at the doctor who shrugged and spoke "Olga has turned out to be an embarrassment. Olga has been embarrassing her Father with various inappropriate public behaviors. That includes a drinking habit she refused to quit despite pregnant with her son. Her son has appeared to have several medical maladies that make him unable to take the King's throne once its time for that to happen. Olivia your sister in question was implanted with an offspring. She was led to believe that a male housemate she found in her bed force mated with her unconscious. This was an excuse to make it seem how she wound up expecting in the first place. The King will be taking in Ian as he's dubbed once he's able to do it. Poor Olivia will wound up saddled with Olga's son as a result."
Guardian frowned and spoke "Who's going to tell Olivia about her family connection towards me and this deception for her to go along with it?"
He eyed the doctor who lowered the book and jabbed a finger in his direction while speaking "As far as I'm concerned Olivia thinks she's Rita Madison's daughter by birth period. Olivia doesn't seem to acknowledge people telling her that she was adopted as a baby. That despite accepting that Missus Madison's husband Ian wasn't her father but her raiser actually. I highly doubt that Olivia will accept that she's related towards you as your sister. Rita has repeatedly telling me various complaints Olivia has said to her about you in question. Most of those complaints involve your appearance reminding her of the male she found in her bed. She reportedly thought she was forced mated unconscious with no details given on how twinning this male is towards your looks actually. Hence my doubting that she'll accept the family connection. I do believe that she'll be told like Missus Madison that Ian had some problem that killed him. A fake medical mistake lie said to her from happening at the hospital. Then later dumped the baby Olga had who dubs him Sparky. It's was used as a payment for bribing Mothers out of suing the hospital. It's a familiar trick that has happened before with Missus Madison who had a baby girl. Her baby girl wound up put down from some sickly status detected. Missus Madison was thrust Olivia to take care as some bribery payment in response. This trick is still ongoing at the moment at hospitals doing it. The hospital is doing this to people whose offsprings were either accidentally killed by medical mistakes or put down a detected sickly fatal status as law states. Sometimes this trick involves people doing baby switching. That's depending on not wanting to be saddled with an offspring that has medical issues. This is common among government officials and people who have a vast amount of wealth they hope to pass down something your Father is currently doing to your sister."
Guardian frowned as the doctor resumed reading his book. He looked off his left as if drawn to see a transparent form of Olivia floating in the room with a glare on her face. 
He frowned wondering to himself "Did she actually hear anything said? I figured I'll ask her once she woke up." 
He heard the doorbell ringing went to answer the door. 
Guardian finding a male Samira with a Mahalia's native look of light brown skin and small brown eyes standing there that had short black hair that spoke "Is Olivia Madison around sir?"
He spoke "Sorry she and her Mother had a medical crisis and is unable to come to the door or assist you with anything. I currently live in the basement apartment and was just helping out with their medical issues I'm not at liberty to say." 
Guardian eyed the male who blurt "Olivia had her baby did she? Let me in and see her now." 
He sighed and unlocked the screen door letting in the male while speaking "Dining room is where she is if you know where it is." 
He shut both doors and found the male in the dining room standing near the doctor pestering with a question he heard "How's Olivia doing and her baby doing?" 
Guardian heard the doctor tell the male "Olivia already birthed her baby. The baby's at the hospital at the moment a medical issue. I can't say when the baby's Mother would wake up from her coma. I admit to drugging Olivia's Mother with some drug. Olivia's Mother was found to act very panicky on not willing to let the baby go with medics to the hospital." 
He eyed the doctor who spoke sounding annoyed after silence from the Samira in response "You have a name sir? Explain what your business with Olivia Madison is now." 
Guardian frowned finding the doctor wasn't speaking with a Victoria state accent. The male he heard was speaking with some accent that reminded him of West Allied state natives speaking it in front of him. 
Guardian heard from the Samira "The name's Daisuke Yamato. I believe I'm the Father of Olivia's baby. That's from finding me in her bed with her in the morning after getting me drunk of alcohol. With clothes on my form indicating that I must have done some mating towards her whose clothes indicated that status as well."
He didn't comment a response eyed the doctor who spoke still using the West allied state accent "Oh thanks for explaining your business with Olivia Madison. Does she know of you and that you fathered her baby?"
He eyed Daisuke who spoke "It was her who discovered me in her bed. She woke me up and later kicked me out of the house once it was apparent she was pregnant. I was staying in the house's basement apartment. It was from losing my home in a spinner disaster over cycles ago in Merryville. Olivia took me in and gave me shelter for me to get back on my feet. Unfortunately I overstayed my welcome with her after she found me in her bed and her expectant status became known. This is when she wound up kicking me out of her residence. I had to move to Northern Territory. Its due to having friends of mine living there. Olivia's Mother, Missus Madison kept contact with me on wanting to know how I was doing. I'm unsure if Missus Madison is aware of me fathering Olivia's offspring actually. Anyway I managed to get back on my feet and then moved back to West Allied state. I moved to Georgina. I currently have a job as a private teacher for families who want their sons to improve their grades in school."
He eyed the doctor who spoke "Actually kindly explain your reason of your visit now." 
He shifted to look at Daisuke who spoke "Missus Madison called me from West Alia to report on how Olivia was doing awhile ago. I told her I was planning on visiting once I was available for a social visit hence I'm here now." 
Guardian frowned further while eyeing Daisuke who kept staring at the doctor. 
He heard from the doctor "Anyway there's nothing you can do for Missus Madison and her daughter now. Mister Yamato, so sorry but I have to ask you to come back another time." 
He kept his attention aimed at Daisuke who looked at him with a narrowed eyed glare.
GuardianGuardian spoke "The name's Guard Beers sir. I'm living in the basement apartment. That's losing my home to a fire which I lost everything. I don't have any family that I know of at the moment."
He clamped his mouth shut feeling himself annoyed with having to lie about himself.
He eyed Daisuke who spoke with his brown almond shaped eyes narrowing "Interesting." 
Guardian frowned with his lips as Daisuke looked away and spoke "You tell Olivia and her Mother that Daisuke Yamato stopped by to see them once their awake, sir. I warn you sir that I'll be back unannounced once I have time to make another social call. I'll see myself out." 
Guardian watched Daisuke left the room and heard the front door manipulated with a loud bang sound he grimaced from the noises. 
Guardian eyed the doctor who formed a glare on his face and snarled "Olivia like her sister was implanted with an offspring from their Mother, fathered by their Father actually. Daisuke isn't the Father of Olivia's child. He appears to believe this fact like Olivia and her Mother believes herself." 
He stiffened from the doctor's words as the doctor continued "I believe your Father will use the excuse of having an unknown surrogate carry the offspring. He'll present to the public as his son and heir to the throne. He'll use the excuse that he and his wife were having marital problems that were lengthy. Your Father will also use an excuse of his wife unwilling to carry another child for him hence the surrogate used as a last effort of producing an heir."
Guardian spoke as the doctor stopped talking "What's the excuse related to Olga's pregnancy?"
He frowned eyeing the doctor who shrugged and spoke "I'm pretty sure that the King will say that she had a miscarriage actually. His lie about that was to hide the fact of a surrogate carrying an offspring for privacy reasons. It's a trick that has happened too many times among previous Kings. They all were wishing to keep their privacy involving male offspring being conceived for them to pass down their title which is still ongoing at the moment." 
He spoke as the doctor looked away towards Olivia "I'm surprised that my Father isn't having me declared his heir despite he said to fathered me." 
Guardian frowned to eye the doctor who resumed looking at him who spoke "I suspect that your Father's wife told him not to declare you as his heir. It was rumored that the woman who birthed you was targeting him in an attempt to break up their marriage and get him as her husband. If this was declared the woman reportedly some famous rich actress would come forwards claiming you as her son. She doing what it takes to get the King to divorce his current wife and marry her. Something the King's wife as rumored feared that would happen. Hence she was talking her husband out of making the declaration regarding you. She reportedly wound up going along with his trick of having a son born by his own daughter and her own daughter to pass down the title."
He groaned softly as the doctor stopped talking to resume reading his book. Guardian went to the living room to find Rita still sleeping away on the couch looking like she was passed out to him. He went to the couch and kneeled on the rugged floor and reached out a hand towards Rita taking her left hand. 
Guardian held the hand while she not stirring thinking to he "What will happen towards Olivia and her Mother raiser?"
He heard nothing in answer to his question remained holding Rita's hand as he sighed softly to frown while adding to his thought "When will I get a purpose in life if I'm not going to be King anyway? I wonder if my purpose will include being paired to someone. I wouldn't mind that but I guess I better wait and see."
Guardian frown feeling his senses blare warning when he thought his questions and wording to frown "I'm finding no reason for the senses to go off while thinking my thoughts."
He felt his senses stopped their blaring to his relief. 
He remained kneeling eyeing Rita sleeping to figure to he "At least I'll figure out the answers for myself period."

Part Two: Answers answered

Guardian stood with the memory running through his mind. He heard the Man of Cloth as his religious title for the religious beliefs involving a God named Lance Richard kept on droning his words. He wasn't paying attention to the words due to how bored he was as snow fell softly from the sky. The snow fell over the funeral for Rita Madison.
"Rita was later diagnosed with breast cancer that was found spread within her body. Medicines were used prolonged her life till the beginning of winter season in April is when she succumbed to cancer" he thought to himself.
He heard a crying sound sighed recognizing the noises from Ian, the boy child the local hospital dumped onto Olivia. 
"That child dumping" he recalled "Was done after claiming that her original son passed away from a medical ailment involving his heart. It was a trick actually for my Father to acquire her baby and put Olga's baby in her care." 
Guardian eyed the coffin holding Rita inside with an array of flowers on top as the priest kept on his droning. 
Guardian recalled "Two suns after the Mahalia Day week was over was when my Father made a public broadcast to the natives. I wound up watching a rebroadcast on TV at a later time. 
My Father wound up blaring “I’m talking about acquiring a son and heir to the throne from a surrogate.” 
The broadcast included my Father saying a lie “Olga actually had a miscarriage hence I lying about that for privacy reasons. The lie was said just to avoid my surrogate getting pressured by public and own family members on keeping the baby. That lie was also said, instead of giving the baby up for me to rise as my heir to pass on the throne.’" 
He sighed softly from the memory "I wound up seeing the broadcast showing my Father's hardly seen wife the Queen coming into camera view holding a wrapped blanketed bundle in her arms. 
My Father said “’I flaunted as the son dubbed Nikolas Alexander Junior named after me as my heir to the throne.’" 
He shifted from eyeing Rita's coffin to eye Olivia wearing a black dress with Daisuke wearing a black suit like he was wearing. Daisuke he saw was standing next to her having a hand on her shoulder while she held Ian. Ian he heard appeared to stop his crying noises from sounds stopping. He stood among various people he recognized were from the town who were dressed in black like he was. 
People who he met had claimed in his presence "We have a friendship with Rita herself. Hence we there attending Rita's religious funeral." 
It was held in West Alia where Rita's husband's departed ceremony was held and cemetery is where he was buried. He eyed the Man of Cloth who stopped his droning on his sermon to pause. He saw the male held up one of his hand freed from the religious book in his hand to make a gesture towards the coffin holding Rita's body. Then shut the book closed and going up to Daisuke to shake hands with the male and walking away. He stood as the snow fell a bit harder eyeing Olivia who remained standing still holding Ian as others around him were sensed walking away. Guardian eyed Daisuke in response appeared to be whispering something to Olivia's ear that bowed her head and didn't see or hear a protest from her as she was guided away from the coffin. Daisuke having hands on her shoulders Olivia still having her head bowed with tears staining her cheeks he glimpsed. Ian he saw appeared to have fallen asleep held in her arms. Guardian didn't say a word waited as the couple passed him. He followed going to a black vehicle dubbed a van. They got inside with him following to sit in a seat in the middle of the vehicle in the back of the van as Olivia, Daisuke and Ian sat at the front seat in front of him. He didn't comment a response as Olivia was heard wailing nonsense sounds. The driver to the van heard verbally starting up the vehicle in some shouting manner. Then the driver drove the vehicle out of the cemetery taking a route to Beach City. 
He sighed softly recalling "Two suns after my Father's flaunting his new son, are when Olivia woke up from her coma to be told of her original son's birth via the doctor himself. The son's birth happened during the spinner storm hitting the area according to the doctor privately. Olivia was then later told of the son's death at the hospital in my presence by the doctor. Rita had to calm her down, being very hysterically upset. I'm surprised that Rita woke up to calm her down despite seen giving the doctor glaring looks of accusation in her eyes." 
He continued to let himself to his thoughts recalling "After Olivia calmed down is when the doorbell rang. I went to answer the doorbell to find a medic there holding a baby I figured from the looks of the offspring was Olga's son. The boy child was presented to my sister. 
She told in my presence me eavesdropping from memory of it 'His Mother is some reported teenage girl dumped him at the hospital. She used the excuse of not wanting to care for him anymore.’ 
Hence I am bringing the baby to you to see if you were willing to take responsibility of caring for him. 
I recalled fully that Olivia without any hesitation spoke 'I'll take the boy child as my own offspring.'
The medic spoke from memory 'Here sign a document of adopting the child on this computer pad.’ 
I saw Olivia sign the computer pad using her left hand. Then the medic took leave of us. 
The doctor there gave the boy child a through check up spoke 'I'm declaring him physically fit. You should contact the hospital for any internal test results done on him. Just to see what can be done for him.'" 
He looked out the window of the van shaking his head of the memory. The driver drove the van on the highway. Guardian wound up recognizing the route to Beach City. 
He wound up still lost in his thoughts to recall "Daisuke stopped by again on a weekend in the morning. I catching Daisuke driving up in his car while hauling the garbage can holding various items I picked up scattered in the backyard and tossed inside. That along with doing some additional yard work to make order to it." 
Guardian recalled "I wound up getting the garbage can at the curb ready for the Samira group's representative to come take the items found inside to get them back to their original owners. 
I recalled telling Olivia 'The yard has items that appear to be from other people's residences.' 
She told me 'I'll call for someone to pick up the stuff.' 
I wound up recalling telling Daisuke of what the doctor told Olivia related to the original baby she had. 
I recalled telling Daisuke 'Olivia was given another male child to care for in his place soon after she was told of the news. She took the offspring as her own son and has been raising him dubbing him by the name of Ian.' 
I was recalling getting from Daisuke 'Interesting.'"
He formed the expression on his lips as he recalled "Daisuke habitually said the comment interesting but refused to explain further to that typical comment said".
He frowned still lost in his thoughts to hear silence from Olivia to think "I figured out that she had stopped wailing which she's sleeping now." 
He concentrated looking out the window to recall "Daisuke kept up the visiting during the whole summer months checking onto Olivia and her son. This included checking on Rita undergoing medical treatments to fight off the cancer that was found terminal within her body according to Olivia during a crying breakdown. 
She wound up confessing ‘My Mother wasn't willing to accept diagnose instead kept on insisting that the medicine would heal her.’ 
It's a view Rita kept up till she passed away quite recently." 
He saw the familiar oceanic view again "I figured that we're in Beach City judging by the looks of the scenery." 
Guardian looked in front of him eyeing Daisuke having an arm around Olivia who appeared to be sleeping to him from her slumped over position. Guardian frowned hearing nothing from Daisuke or Ian to sense that the boy child was sleeping sandwiched between Olivia and the male. 
The van reached the house to park at the curb he hearing from the driver "We're here so you can get out now." 
He got out of the van and stood outside with the snow still falling appearing to cover the grassed ground in a half hearted way. He eyed Daisuke wake up Olivia by gently kissing her on the cheek and shaking her awake. Guardian watched Olivia wake up to pick up Ian and carry him out of the van followed by Daisuke. He shut the doors to the van behind them. Guardian wordlessly followed them to the house stopping at the porch's first step to yank out his keys to the apartment. He watched Olivia go inside the house followed by Daisuke unlocking the door and shutting it behind them with a gentle slam. He sighed and walked around the house. He taking the familiar route to the apartment to find a cat wearing a collar with a leash attached. The cat he recognized as Bob standing at the top most steps giving off a meow in a questioning tone. He sighed as he recognized Granny Kim's cat. 
Guardian groaned softly "Bloody Hades to Bob! I figured from Bob being in the yard is that he has escaped Granny Kim again. His presence here is from being spooked by a loose dog in the neighborhood as always happening whenever she brought the gonoid outside by leashed walks. He was always found sitting in the yard collar and leash attached. The cat was always there at his spot waiting for me to bring him inside and give his owner a phone call to come pick him up." 
Guardian groaned and went to Bob picking up the cat's leash as he mentally added "I figured out that Bob hated being picked up after giving me multiple scratches and bites to my hands and arms. This injury status resulted from Bob being picked up to bring the gonoid inside the apartment." 
He went down the steps finding Bob leading the way. Guardian unlocked the door opening it and found the cat darting inside straining against the leash. He walked inside and shut the door still holding onto the leash. Guardian went to the phone to dial Granny Kim's number waiting patiently for her to pick up. His waiting was rewarded when the phone was picked up to his relief.
He recalled "I pestered Olivia to get me phone service which she did on request of her Mother hence the phone working for me."
He got a voice on the line speaking "Yes?"
He spoke recognizing the voice as the Mayor's "This is Guard Beers. I have your Mother's cat Bob in my possession. He appears to have escaped your Mother while out on a leashed walk with her. That's still having a leash attached to his collar." 
He stopped talking to hear muffled talking he couldn't make it out. 
This followed by the Mayor's familiar voice on the line speaking "Can you take Bob in on a permanent basis? My Mother was found unresponsive lying on a sidewalk appearing to have her light extinguished by a neighbor walking his dog. Bob no where in sight. The Dead Keeper is still running tests on how her light was extinguished." 
He groaned softly to himself and spoke "I have to ask my landlord permission on taking in Bob. It's from not knowing the policy regarding pets." 
He paused from talking to again hear muffled talking followed by the Mayor's voice speaking clearly "I left a message on Missus Madison's answering machine about my request. I'm still waiting for her to call me back. Excuse me I have to go now." 
He sighed softly as there was a dial tone in his ear. He hung up the phone and eyed Bob. 
Guardian recalled "It was a lunar cycled month ago of coming upon the house to see an ambulance parked there from a grocery shop walk to Terrio store. I had stood on the porch wondering what going on to see Rita was carried out on a stretcher by medics. She looking like she was sleeping and looking deathly pale while wearing an oxygen mask covering her mouth area. I watched them haul her into the ambulance as Olivia came out of the house crying. Olivia appeared to get hysterically upset. I put down my cloth bag holding my groceries on the porch's floor. I recalled I without a word hugged Olivia sensing she was accepting my touch by clinging to me. I even didn't break off the hold as Olivia was sensed leaning onto me for support as the ambulance's sirens were heard before the noises fading away. I recalled on kept on holding Olivia lengthy hearing her crying softly.
Her noises would broken by hearing a loud voice speaking 'Excuse me let me have her!'
I heard the venomous anger in Daisuke's voice finding Daisuke standing on the porch with a glare on his face. I saw that the male's car was in the driveway which I without a word handed off Olivia to the male who got her inside slamming the door. I picked up my grocery bag and carried it to the apartment going inside. I recalled an hour later of hearing the laundry room doorbell ringing. I went to answer the door to find Daisuke standing there that gave me a glare.
Daisuke spoke 'Olivia told me what happened to her Mother once calmed down. You should have gotten her inside the house instead of standing there hugging her lengthy for the public to see. I don't find it amusing that you're taking advantage of Olivia despite me courting her at the moment.' 
I from the memory stiffened from fear to see Daisuke's eyes turn all black looking creeping me out. 
The creepy eyed look making me admits to Daisuke 'I'm the King's rumored first born son. One of the servants of my Father in a secret meeting pointed out that the second daughter the King's wife carried. It wasn't as admitted to the public was actually Olivia herself. She's my sister actually. I'm still not sure if she's aware of that or not.' 
I wound up from the memory to find Daisuke speaking in a creepy cruel voice tone still displaying the all black eyed look 'Don't ever lie to me on anything again. I can detect lies. I don't like the lies you been spouting to Olivia and her Mother about yourself. That includes hearing people lying about what really happened to her original son. I know that the hospital switched babies actually. Don't lie to me period.' 
I recalling managed to give a head bob as Daisuke told me 'What's your background? The actual story was related to you as the King's first born son?' 
I wound up admitting 'I was raised by a deaf female named Verona. She's a midwife who passed away in a car accident from a drunk driver driving the wrong way on a highway. The deception of me posing as her son came out. The actual public story as publicity known is that I was born from an unknown to this day famous actress who hid the pregnancy and birthed me in secret. The story is the truth actually on how I came to exist. That story broke out via tabloid. Other presses took hold of the news and blared all over the place. The presses' media all saying that I was the King's first born son actually. My Father the King confirmed this publicity. He has refused to let me be flaunted to the public. It has left people to debate on who should take the King crown. The debate started soon after the news of my Father's oldest child my sister Olga had a son as broadcasted by my Father. People have been evenly divided on who should take the crown after my Father announced my nephew as the heir.'
I continued to remember the memory that Daisuke spoke 'Admits what you knew of the baby switch and don't lie to me.’ 
The story I told Daisuke came out as told to me by the doctor monitoring Olivia. I recalled telling Daisuke the doctor's views of Olivia's views towards people telling her that she was adopted by Rita. 
'The doctor claimed to me that Olivia wouldn't believe the news of me and her being siblings.' 
Guardian broke himself of the memory to eye Bob that strained against the leash again. Bob appeared from the straining to want to go to his couch which he sighed. Guardian released the leash letting the cat walk away going to the furniture to jump on and sit on it curling into a ball and appeared to be snoozing away. 
He sighed "I recalled from the memory of Daisuke finished his interrogation by showing brown Egyptian eyes. 
Daisuke speaking to me in a normal Egyptian male voice in a West Allied state accent 'Keep your mouth shut about this and my non Egyptian abilities to yourself. I'll find out if you've blabbed. Believe me I'll always find out period.'"
Guardian went into the bedroom after shaking his head of the memory "Daisuke wound up leaving me. I recalled I wound up hearing a rumor from Granny Kim after calling her of finding Bob in the yard again with his leash. 
Granny Kim told me 'I heard a rumor already going around town that Olivia has a mate friend. There's conflicting reports on who the guy was. Witnesses have been seeing two different males at different times appearing to act mate friendly towards Olivia in question. I was wondering what was going on. So can you tell me to set the matter straight?'"
Guardian sighed as he stripped himself of the cheapo suit and shoes he acquired from Terrio's store.
Guardian recalled telling Granny Kim "Olivia is actually courted by one male quite strongly. The male in question made it clear to me that she was his period. Besides I saw Olivia as a sister too strongly. That feeling I feel towards Olivia to bother courting her in some mate friend courtship."
He sighed to put away the suit and shoes and socks into the closet leaving him clad only in his underwear to go to the dresser. 
He recalled the phone call with Granny Kim who told him "'I'm coming over in my car to pick up Bob as soon as possible.'”
I recalled I heard the dial tone in my ear indicating that she had hung up the phone. I took the cat by leash with some protests to the porch in front of the house. I wound up to sit in a lawn chair still holding onto the cord tightly while waiting for the cat's owner to come pick him up. I recalled Daisuke coming out of the house to give him a glaring stare with all black eyed look again not saying anything but heard a throat clearing noise from the male. I found myself telling everything what I heard from Granny Kim via phone call including everything I said to her. I recalled fully Daisuke not saying a word instead went inside the house slamming the door in response. Granny Kim arrived in her two seat sedan parking the car at the curb. I got up and pulled Bob over towards her to find her putting the cat in a cat carrier after getting out of the car. 
Granny Kim commenting loudly towards me 'Olivia is apparently heavily spied on. It happened since word got out on her Mother having a terminal cancer diagnose. The town's people are overheard wondering who was going to take her Mother's place. They've been commenting on when Olivia would get a husband, a Father figure to her adopted son, Ian. The males reportedly have claimed to have some kind of code of behavior that only can be passed down via male to male.'"
Guardian groaned from his memory thoughts as he yanked out jeans and a sweatshirt from the dresser putting them on along with winter socks. 
He recalled "I recalled asking Granny Kim 'Should I inform Olivia of that rumor going around town? What’s the town’s person expected from Olivia anyway?'
I recalled told by Granny Kim 'Not to bother with that. I'll tell Olivia herself in person of this.'
I wound up watching as Granny Kim went to the house and rang the doorbell finding Daisuke answering the door. Granny Kim appeared to have a whispered talk with Daisuke I not hearing what's said seemingly lengthy. 
Granny Kim wound up seen walked away going to her car saying to me on the way to the vehicle 'Everything will be taken care of. You don't need to do anything about the rumor.'
I saw her get into the sedan and driving off." 
Guardian heard a doorbell sound breaking him of his memories. He sighed recognizing the sound from the laundry room. Guardian went to answer the door finding Daisuke there still clad in his suit but missing the jacket. He wordlessly stared at Daisuke waiting for the male to say something. 
Daisuke spoke "Bob, you have him in your possession?"
Guardian heard a meow in response before he could talk and saw Daisuke look down which he did the same. He grimaced finding the cat rubbing his head on Daisuke's foot and acting very friendly towards the male despite not friendly with himself in question.
He spoke making sure he sounded serious "Does that answer your question sir?"
He eyed Daisuke who without a word picked up Bob who didn't protest to that and seemed content being held in Daisuke's grips around him. 
Daisuke spoke looking at him "You're free to have Bob in your apartment. That's whenever the cat requests to go inside. I'm giving Bob free rein to go any where in the house as well. Besides Olivia told me of having a cat as youngster soon after her Mother passed away. I figured that Bob's presence in the house should help her with her grief. Anyway I'll inform Missus Lords of the adoption of Bob. So she can send over the proper nourishment and stuff for taking care of him, excuse me." 
He watched as Daisuke left him going up the stairs still carrying Bob that still wasn't complaining of being held. Guardian heard the door to the basement slam shut. He sighed and shut the door to his apartment and felt himself hungry. He went to the kitchen to get a microwave meal. 
He thought to himself "I felt regret of not able to cook some meals on my outdoor stove. The snowy weather hitting at the moment that the cold temps had made it harder for me to cook my food on it properly outside. Besides, Olivia had an angry fit when she caught me cooking outside in the snowy weather. 
She yelled at me ‘I accused you of trying to burn down the house with the cooking!’ which her Mother had to come out and calm her down.
I recalled that Olivia after the angry fit told me 'You're not to cook on that stove again unless I tell you otherwise period.'
I wound up having to obey to Olivia's order. Bloody Hades to Olivia for that order!" 
He put the meal into the microwave after removing it from the package thinking to himself "I recalling Rita two weeks after Olivia's adoption of Ian had asked me 'Do you know how to cook on an outdoor stove regardless of what was fueling its energy for cooking? I was planning on hosting a party to introduce my grandson to friends in town. Their questioning me on my grandson and wondering why he looked older than he supposedly looked. That's from not knowing the actual story of my original grandchild passing away in the hospital from a medical ailment. The medic giving Olivia, Ian in my grandson's place which I have accepted the adoption. I wanted people to know the actual story. That to happen instead of speculating something odd was going on with Ian to make him seem non Egyptian like.' 
I recalled fully telling Rita 'I can cook anything on an outdoor stove regardless of what it was fueled by. It's from having experience of doing the cooking over too many cycles.'" 
Guardian frowned thinking to himself as the microwave cooked his food "I wasn't really bragging on my talk about outdoor stoves like Rita seemed to indicate towards me. I was really used as the cook at outdoor parties my Mother raiser had me attend in the summer months. It was mostly attending the parties back to back in various towns all over Victoria State. A job I held since I was age fourteen a job I was paid to do the cooking for various people hosting the party which I kept it up till my Mother raiser passed away. People stopped their interests in having me as their cook as a result. I wound up having to cook for myself to keep practicing my outdoor stove cooking ability. I kept the cooking up till my Father ordered me to live in West Allied state. That happened after a private meeting. I had managed to acquire some summer job work of cooking at parties on the weekends and holidays despite working weekdays at Trick. I had to stop the cooking job, my arm injury and rehabilitation to my arm and hand. This happened after multiple surgeries to fix the damage. I haven't cooked since Rita asked me to cook for a party-" 
Guardian heard the ding of the microwave finishing its cooking interrupting his thoughts. He took out the meal and got out a fork and ate it not caring that it was burning his tongue again from how hot it felt in his mouth. He swallowed the food fast finding he terribly hungry. He once done eating put the tray into the garbage can and then washed the fork putting it away. He drank out of the milk carton like he habitually had done despite not drinking out of other liquid holder's cartons and using cups for them. 
He sighed and went to the couch to sit thinking "The party for Ian's introduction went off without a problem. I wound cooking off an outdoor gas stove Rita claimed to have bought from a female friend getting rid of it her husband's light extinguished abruptly. 
Olivia told me during the summer months before she caught me using it during a snowy snowstorm 'You can use the stove anytime you like for cooking meals for yourself. The price is cooking for my family members whenever they asked you to cook for me or them.'" 
He sighed from the memory and grabbed the remote turning on the TV to the weather channel finding the other news' channels were blaring paid programs. 
Guardian continued to remember "I wound up cooking for a public wedding and party for Daisuke and Olivia on the town's green. The cooking happened a week after Rita was sent to the hospital reportedly bedridden and unable to care for her needs. That most of the town's people showed up for the event. Some people were just there to join in the fun and others just to spy and give out rumors towards whoever was listening. All sorts of talk I heard was all over the place including mention of the King's son, heir to the throne was conceived for the King to pass down the King's title and duties. The son's conceiving was his wife not willing to let him do the pass down of the King's title towards me his hidden first born son. It was rumored to be out of jealousy towards the unidentified actress who bore me. The Queen was rumored to be thinking that the actress would target her husband with marriage on her mind if I the son was flaunted as the heir. Hence I remaining have hidden from the public." 
Guardian groaned putting the remote down on the table to rub a hand on his forehead to think "I wound up overhearing people commenting on that rumor involving the King's first born son. I mostly heard the rumor spoken among the grandparent folks whenever I was in their presence. I paid some fifty pound price to cook on outdoor stoves at their homes for parties all over town. It happened after Rita's party was held. 
Rita informed me 'My friends told me of being very impressed with the way you cooked the food. They have been recommending you to others around town. They reportedly said to hold a party on certain days after announcing the party to the town's people to attend.' 
I found myself saddled with the cooking job all summer long all over town. I always paid the price of fifty pounds for private parties including paid one hundred pounds for parties that involved the town having traditional yearly events in the summer months."
He sighed from rubbing his forehead and focused onto the weather channel "We are predicting that the light snow already hitting the state is going to turn into a snowstorm. The snow is going to travel through Mahalia hitting the southern part of the continent's states with lots of snow. We're not sure if the storm will turn to ice having that happen to West Allied state after a freak snowstorm hit the state. It happened during the last cycle during the change over from summer to winter. An ice storm was formed and knocked out power for the entire state that is still recovering from a spinner storm as dubbed Marina hitting near the end of spinner storm season in March." 
He groaned hearing "The spinner storm Marina according to our records wound up to hit the sea resort town of Beach City with lots of damage. The same towards nearby towns in its path as Marina traveled over Mahalia becoming a tropical storm while missing several states and Victoria State. Marina wound up traveling out onto the ocean becoming another huge spinner like storm. Then was last heard causing havoc on the continent of Columbia before there was no word of it since." 
He groaned loudly to eye the time on his watch "Bloody Hades. That thing is always stuck to my wrist on my right arm. I keep forgetting to take it off despite it's never taken off even when showering or swimming at pools. The watch was always taken off whenever doing swimming in the ocean during breaks of doing jobs of cooking at beachside houses. Fin Biters are said to be attracted to wrist watches and jewelry worn by people swimming in the ocean to bite them. The bite was enough to cause a chunk of their body to get detached from them. This included their arms and legs sometimes surgery was able to fix back if the detached status wasn't that bad. There was times when people were permanently amputated the Fin Biter's bite had bit the body part off entirely. The body part discovered swallowed by the gonoid accidentally and digested to the point of being not able to be repaired to be attached back to the person it bit. I recalling I wound up swimming in the ocean during a break of cooking for a teenaged college student's party while mostly people the same age as the college student were partying on land. Some appearing to get drunk from illegal alcohol brought to the party and getting into the water to drown their drunken status caused them to swim badly. I found myself repeatedly having to haul them out of the ocean their drunken status that was causing them to drown. I wound up punching out numerous drunks unconscious after saving them for the third time. The drunks kept going into the water and appearing to drown themselves after I got them out of the water safety and didn't appear to get my message of being too drunk to swim." 
He saw that the time on his wrist watch was around three o'clock in the afternoon. 
Guardian felt himself quite tired as he thought "I wound up attending the wake held in a Dead Keeper's home in West Alia. 
It was due to Olivia on her begging me 'Please be there for me with my husband Daisuke and Ian there.' 
We wound up attending the Dead Keeper's home the previous night receiving numerous visitors that gave out condolences towards Olivia. The visiting lasted till a late evening hour of eleven o'clock. That's the time is when the Dead Keeper's home closed with Daisuke able to drive us home to Beach City to stay overnight at the house." 
He yawned stretching his arms "I recalling that the drive was an hour long. We got home around midnight despite Olivia keeping me awake in the car and refusing to let me sleep. She kept on clinging towards me in some upset manner while ignoring Ian felt sandwiched between us using a seat belt for him. Lucky kid he fell asleep and ignored Olivia's weeping fit.
I recalled being told by Olivia 'I'm expecting you on the porch at seven o'clock for the drive to the Dead Keeper's home by a hired driver. The driver is driving me and family to there. There'll be a mass at the Lancelot Church in West Alia. Then this will be followed by Man of Cloth blessing in the cemetery. This includes then driven home after that.'"
Guardian continued to yawn lowering his arms feeling himself still exhausted. 
He felt tiredness from only having only four straight hours of sleep "I wound up woken up at four o'clock in the morning by the doorbell to my apartment going off outside. I went to the door to peer finding the light was on but no one in sight after opening the door. I recalled finding a postcard from Elizabethan Island taped to my door with a note written on it.
The note said 'Meet me at the gazebo at five o'clock ASAP.'
I figured the note indicate to me to meet Warwick with urgent news. I wound up going to the gazebo ten minutes early and sat in the cold air waiting. I recalling on waiting till I sensed myself spied on once five o'clock arrived. I wound up looking around to find the watchers were all over the place. I met a male figure wearing winter geared clothes twin to mine with a flashlight arrived to the gazebo. I discovering to my shock wasn't Warwick but my Father actually." 
Guardian again yawned again recalling "The meeting with my Father resulted in him heavily interrogated me on Olivia's life and her Mother raiser Rita. My Father from my questioning didn't seemed interested in learning much about me, his son's own life by ignoring my attempts to bring up the subject. My Father from voice tone seemed shocked hearing that Olivia was married to Daisuke Yamato who both was currently raising Ian, Olga's son together. 
My Father commented some mysterious comment 'Deity wants deity gets.'
That was before abruptly ending the meeting by getting up and walking away. I found myself compelled to remain seated for thirty minutes timed on my watch. The watching sense went away abruptly is when I got up and walked back to the house. I found the time was six o'clock on the alarm clock by it blaring loudly in my bedroom after arriving there to sleep." 
He again yawned and leaned back in the couch while eyeing the TV still blaring to shut his eyes to come to hearing the doorbell ringing loudly. Guardian woke up finding the TV was still blaring. The time on the screen was indicating two hours had passed. He again heard the doorbell to laundry room groaned getting up and shaking his head of sleep and went to the laundry room's door yanking it open to see Daisuke.
Daisuke he saw gestured to objects on the floor while speaking "This junk is for the cat to take residence in your apartment. That's whenever Bob indicates on wanting to go there. So figure out what to do with the items. I'm not teaching you." 
He wound up eyeing Daisuke that went up the stairs after saying his words towards him. 
Guardian eyed the junk on the floor Daisuke called it to think "I find the stuff is familiar from what I read in a cat book Kendra gave me to read and from taking care of Batty caged." 
Guardian without a word hauled everything out of the laundry room into his bedroom. He shut the door to the laundry room once done and set the apartment ready for a cat to take residence. By putting the cat's litter box filled with litter in the bathroom due to finding a spot for it next to the toilet. He put the nourishment bowls in the living room next to the wall filling them with food and water. 
Guardian put the remaining food away into a cupboard he figured "I'll set aside for Bob, the cat, whenever I was expected to keep a fresh supply of food nourishment. It was for Bob visiting my apartment from whenever the gonoid wanted to do it." 
He felt himself tired again went to the TV shutting it off and turned off the living room lights by light switches in the hallway leading to his bedroom and bathroom. Guardian used the wall to blindly find his way to the bedroom finding the laundry room door after his hand whacked the doorknob. He groaned from the pain and then searched for the alarm clock. 
He came to realize "Bloody Hades, I had set that thing down in a way for its glowing in the dark digital numbered lights weren't blaring like a nightlight. The light blaring to me would wound up repeatedly waking me up during my sleep."
Guardian groaned again. He forced himself to slide his feet to the bed his lower leg whacking against the bed's edge. He groaned again and then blindly got himself into bed blankets covering him up to his chest. 
Guardian felt himself warmed by the blankets "Blast the apartment's internal computer not yet registering the apartment cold enough to turn the heat on. It did with the air conditioner whenever it registered heat outside too warm for Egyptians keeping me cool in the summer time during blasting heat waves. The computer has a mind of its own for not always turned on during other heated days. It's balking of the air conditioner turning on has wound up leaving me to sweat in bed with the windows forced open. "
He sighed as he lay in bed fluffing the pillow and reached blindly for the alarm clock to check the time finding it was after five o'clock in the afternoon. Despite the darkness which he set the thing down to block the glowing it gave off and shut his eyes finding himself relieved to be sleeping. Guardian wound up passing out unconscious till the sound of a doorbell blared waking him up from sleep. He shook himself awake still hearing the doorbell sounding two more times before cutting itself off. He hearing noises came from the laundry room door. Guardian groaned and turned on the lamp and adjusted the alarm clock to see only an hour had passed since he lain down asleep. Groaning he got up and cut his noises going to the door yanking it open to find Daisuke there flaring his familiar all black eyed look with an angry expression on the male's face. He sighed as Daisuke used his familiar voice and tone used whenever flaring the all black eyed look in the faces of him, Ian and Olivia and never anyone else period. 
Daisuke spoke "Talk on that you received a visitor so early this morning at four o'clock. Your apartment's doorbell was detected going off according to the computer I checked. It's from you looking too sleepy this morning and snoozing in the car too much. That includes you nearly falling asleep during church mass. You managed to shake that sleepiness status off once at the cemetery. The computer's motion detector is reporting you asleep an hour ago so talk now." 
Guardian groaned softly and spoke "I received a communiqué from people working for my Father taped to my door. It is always a post card from Elizabethan Island nation. The postcard had wording on what to do for meeting privately with his people to discuss various subjects I should be aware of."
He frowned as Daisuke's eyes narrowed which he added "The postcard instructed me to meet at the gazebo on the town's green at five o'clock in the morning as fast as I could. I arrived there ten minutes early. The person meeting me turned out to be my Father himself. He interrogated me heavily about Olivia and her Mother raiser Rita. He seemed shocked to being told that Olivia was married to you. 
My Father said this mysterious comment of 'Deity wants deity gets.' 
He said it before ending the meeting by walking away. Would this deity business have something to do with you having some non Egyptian abilities? Like what you're flaring at me with your eyes' change ability I'm seemingly aware of it?"
He clamped his mouth shut and eyed Daisuke who kept his eyes narrowed before speaking "Egyptians with unusual abilities that make them odd towards normal Egyptian standards are considered prizes for rulers to have in servitude. Those odd Egyptians are forced into serving the rulers for life. This along with doing what it takes to pass down that ability through selected females the ruler approves for them to mate with. I had run in with people serving rulers over the years I lived. I outliving normal Egyptian life spans while traveling all over Egyptia. I always keep myself out of serving their rulers once they figured out something unusual about me." 
Guardian gulped hearing Daisuke's confession as Daisuke continued talking "Besides once I reached Mahalia during Brittany's invasion is when I started that national cult group known today as Samira. The cult was just to get people to see Egyptians with unusual abilities deity like and do anything to worship them as their deity including doing whatever the deity orders them to do. The Samira group wound up mysteriously influenced quite heavily to worshipping some deity God known by the name of Lance Richard. This Lance Richard deity worshipping is still ongoing at the moment despite them not interested in worshipping anyone else displaying non Egyptian abilities." 
He exhaled a breath as Daisuke kept talking "Besides your Grandfather Owen your Father's Father as a young man through a female spy servant managed to get a hold of me through nosiness of asking Samira members. It was nosiness on who created the group and pretending to be a follower. It was when the information of me came out. Owen managed to find me living somewhere in Victoria State. Owen tried to force me into servitude repeatedly through various ways including threats. That despite me was giving him resistance."
He groaned softly as Daisuke kept talking "I managed to get Owen to quit that behavior after taking out various females targeting him for wanting to be Queen. The females not caring about whether they loved him or not just as long as they were married to him to achieve the titled position soon after his Father passed away. It was I who helped Owen find the right female to declare as his wife. His declaration was from acquiring a Northern Columbian born female named Matilda. Matilda loved him for his personality after he anonymously went to college in Northern Columbia. Owen always had interests in acquiring Matilda and she doing the same. I got them together after going to Northern Columbia to search for her. That was from his Father passing away required him to return to Mahalia to take the King position. I found Matilda and brought her to Owen she accepting that he was a King of a nation and still willing to be his wife."
Guardian sighed again as Daisuke kept talking "Owen from that day of marriage backed off on having me serve him and his descendants as a favor for finding him the right female he wanted as his wife. Your Father Nikolas from what he said in front of you seems to know about me from his Father telling him. He didn't realize that I would find a female unknowingly a part of the royal family to marry. That's from having multiple wives over the cycles I lived in Mahalia always outliving them. Hence he shocked to hear I married Olivia who you truthfully said is the Queen's daughter with another male." 
He sighed again as Daisuke's eyes turned Egyptian brown looking who added changing his voice tone "I expect you to keep your mouth shut on what I told you. I'll keep your secret of you being the King's son if you keep the secret of what I am period." 
He spoke finding himself compelled to agree "I agree with you on secrets to be kept but does Olivia know of what you just admitted towards me?"
He eyed Daisuke with a frown who spoke "Olivia wasn't fooled that I wasn't a normal Egyptian after taking me into her home to live in her apartment you're living in now. She somehow figured out that there was something special involving me. She wasn't fully told of what it was till she found me in bed with her. That happened after waking up in the morning to figure out that I took advantage of her through some drunken status. I was actually drugged not drunk and she threatened to sicken the cops onto me. I told her everything and pleaded with her not to have me jailed. She appeared to accept what I was after showing my eye change ability to her. She managed to kick me out once it was apparent she was pregnant she believing the offspring was my child. Olivia threatened to sicken the cops onto me if I didn't leave. I still kept tabs on her through written communication towards her Mother raiser. Rita was very wordy on what was going on with Olivia thinking that I was asking for permission to court her which she gave."
Guardian spoke "Olivia agreeing to have this relationship with you and later marrying you?"
He frowned as Daisuke spoke "The relationship was pushed by Rita insisting towards Olivia to have a husband to help out with her adopted son Ian. She approved of me being the husband in Olivia's presence in my presence. Olivia wound up taking me in on a permanent basis to help out with her Mother suffering from cancer and raising Ian. It was this female Granny Kim who insisted on marriage to happen. 
Granny Kim told me ‘Some rumor saying that Olivia was courted by two males seen acting mate friendly with her. This behavior was leaving people assuming that the males were friendly with each other and competing in some gambling bet on who could get Olivia in bed.’ 
Olivia was told of the rumor and from her angry wording in my presence ‘I was thinking of kicking the both of you out of the house.’ 
She wound up agreeing to the marriage after visiting her Mother in the hospital. Rita in my presence managed to get her to oath on marrying me just to have someone take care of her and Ian. I had the marriage happen right away. I arranged a town meeting as ordered by the Mayor. 
The Mayor was hinting to the public ‘A local couple not identified wanted to get married on wanting to have everyone in the town to be there for the ceremony.’ which was done. 
Those rumors related towards Olivia were stopped as a result of that." 
He sighed softly as Daisuke stopped talking to give him a narrowed eyed glare with suspicion in the eyes' look which he spoke "Ugh don't know what you're implying." 
He frowned as Daisuke spoke "Owen had some unusual mental ability involved with detecting people spying onto him. It didn't matter if they were from hidden statuses or shown for him to see them doing it. A trait he passed down onto his son Nikolas who has shown to inherited that ability so talk if you got it." 
He sighed and spoke "I have that ability as inherited. Have you have any psychic abilities someone told me that I have that I have experience in?"
Guardian frown eyeing Daisuke who looked up the stairs before resuming looking at him looking nervous and he speaking "That psychic abilities is a part of a religious belief that I dubbed Bitchy. Don't ask me for why I dub it that insult name. I find it insulting anyway. It's turning out to be a religion that is getting a hold among the older folks in the Samira group at the moment. They have dropped out of the group as a result. They've been using various psychic related abilities also known as part of the Bitchy religion to gain money on the side from superstitious people. Those people suckers into willing to believe anything including predictions they tell them just to get currency from it. Those people have managed to get some younger people not in the Samira group but appearing to not have anything related towards religions into the Bitchy religion. I suspect is what happened to you by you saying that you have experience in it." 
He groaned loudly hearing Daisuke's words as Daisuke gave him a glare with suspicion in his eyes again.
He spoke "Yes, that's exactly what happened to me involving the Bitchy religion you call it involving psychic abilities. Some old woman pushed the belief onto me very strongly after saying some accurate predictions involving me having an injury to my left arm. Hence the scar marking there which it actually happened. I wound up as a believer as a result. I haven't been that faithful in following the religion's customs since I've moved into here. I haven't bothered to do anything related to it after I got into this apartment. I haven't seemed interested in practicing its customs." 
Guardian clamped his mouth shut while eyeing Daisuke to hear loudly "Days why are you down there too long talking to Guard? You promised that you would help me put the dishes away from the dishwasher. And see about getting Ian to bed tonight since he's been quite stubborn on when its time for him to sleep." 
He eyed Daisuke who spoke looking nervous "Got to go see you."
He frowned hearing the nervous voice tone from Daisuke and watched as the male darted up the stairs in a fast move to hear a door slam shut.
Guardian sighed thinking to himself "Bloody Hades, appears it's Olivia who's running this marriage at the moment. That's judging by Daisuke's facial expression and voice sounding nervous. It's a pity on that." 
He shut the door to hear a faint scratching sound coming from the area seemingly lengthy with the scratching as he went to sit on the bed. He groaned and went to the door yanking it open to see Bob streak inside a blur of orange heading out of the bedroom. He shut the door and left it unlocked and felt himself too tired to entertain the cat in the living room. Guardian went back to bed throwing the blankets up to his chest and shutting off the lamp. He sighed as he shut his eyes allowing himself to sleep passing out unconscious. 

Guardian came to hearing a loud meow sounding in his left ear waking him up along with feeling a cat's paw pawing his face. He groaned to reach over to turn on the lamp to eye Bob sitting on the bed as the doorbell to his apartment blared unexpectedly making him check for the time. He found the time was midnight. Guardian got up darting towards the door turning on the living room lights to peer through the peephole finding the light on but no one in sight. He groaned rubbing a hand on his forehead and yanked open the door to find a familiar postcard taped to the door. He took the postcard off the door shutting the door to find Bob in the living room giving off a meow in a questioning tone to him. 
Guardian ignored Bob to read the note on the postcard "Gazebo, now immediately!" 
He sighed and without a word got himself into winter gear. Guardian grabbed a flashlight and his keys which he shut off the lights to his apartment and walked out locking the door making sure that Bob didn't sneak out with him. He groaned softly as he traveled in the cold the grass making crunching noises underneath his boots and reached the sidewalk taking it to the towns green. Guardian saw a light of a smoker sitting there which he assumed was Warwick shut off the flashlight and went to sit down and cleared his throat. 
Guardian thought to himself after a silence of no talking "What's going on? Besides the cigarette smoke is making me disgusted. I used to have a smoking habit myself but I quit once I was hospitalized with my arm injury. The doctors' got me to quit."
Guardian spoke "Smoking is bad for you anyway." 
He heard in response in Warwick's familiar voice "What does this Daisuke Yamato as he's called now knows about you and Olivia?"
Guardian spoke "Daisuke admitted to having some non Egyptian deity abilities. He has been flaunting the abilities in my presence including in the presences of Ian and Olivia as claimed to me. Olivia has as claimed to me, already figured out what makes him so special. Daisuke has admitted one of the abilities includes an ability to detect lies. He flaunted that to me and got me to admit the whole story about who I am and what Olivia is to me. That happened after catching us together in some compromising mate friend position. And yes he does know of the deception related to Olivia's original son and she dumped her sister's son to rise."
He heard a hiss of breath as he added "I was told of the offspring deception by the doctor called by the name of Hammad Ashar. The doctor himself blabbed everything while he was monitoring Olivia after she gave birth. This doctor appeared to know who I was the moment he laid eyes onto me by a shocked expression forming on his face after our first meeting. He indicated he knew who I was by saying it. He spoke using a Victoria state accent only alone in my presence at meetings for me to both my apartment and me to check up on a comatose Olivia herself with her Mother raiser not within earshot. The doctor used a West Allied state accent in front of Daisuke, Olivia and her Mother raiser. Besides Daisuke when told a lie by me in front of the presences of Olivia and her Mother raiser has habitually not been that wordy in response to my lies. He appeared to have that habit when the doctor told lies in my presence. This happened after catching the doctor in the laundry room the inner entrance to my apartment from the house talking to me repeatedly instead of being near Olivia to monitor her. The doctor has repeatedly in private given me medical information on what he's been doing towards Olivia to keep her in some drugged sleep status. That includes with admitting on doing it towards her Mother raiser whenever she brings up the subject of Olivia's offspring in his presence."
He again heard a hiss as he paused from talking to continue "He did admit that the drugged sleep status was to keep Olivia from inquiring about her son. She woke up to give birth to the baby during a spinner storm raging outside cutting the power. He drugged her back to sleep soon after that. The doctor admitted to me that he tried to keep the baby's birth from being known to her Mother raiser who checked onto them. Rita found the baby him giving off noises. Her Mother raiser told me of the baby's birth and according to the doctor had gotten a hold of the baby during the power outage. It was while the doctor was trying to communicate to a hospice vehicle to come take the baby away. It took him three hours till communication was established which the offspring was taken. That happened despite Rita her Mother raiser's name giving up a big fight on not wanting to give up her grandson. She wound up locking herself in the first floor bathroom with him inside. The door had to be smashed to gain entrance and she hit with sleeping darts enough to not give up resistance to the baby taken away. 
The doctor admitted that after the medics left with the baby is ‘I gave Rita a sleep drug that appeared to be slow taking effect.’ 
She was able to get to my apartment and tell me of being drugged. I helped her up the stairs to the couch and she passed out from the looks of it. I went to meet the doctor who admitted knowing who I was without me saying anything towards him."
He stopped talking to frown hearing a cough sound from Warwick who he saw through the moonlight got up to stub out the cigarette. 
Then Warwick resumed sitting next to him which he heard "There's people in the King's circle among the government officials not yet indentified that have others speaking for them. Their hinting very strongly that you as the first born son should be the heir to the throne. They don't seem to care that the Queen was the one who talked your Father out of making that declaration despite some jealousy towards the female who bore you. The Queen reportedly suspects on who she is despite identity not confirmed or said to her yet. The Queen is seemingly jealous enough to think that this female would target her husband with marriage on her mind including being successful in breaking up her marriage with the King if you were publicity known and declared the heir. This is something the Queen doesn't want to happen in the first place."
He spoke as Warwick paused "What about the male that fathered Olivia? The Queen reportedly cheated on some fight with her husband? Making her doing it and my Father doing the same thing?"
Guardian frown eyeing Warwick who cleared his throat and spoke "The male in question after the Queen's second daughter was secretly born, a secret DNA test used among the staff finding a match, was ordered assassinated in some fake attempt assassination on the King. It was done by hired assassins willing to do that job for a high money sum who managed to kill him successfully. The male by DNA test matched, was reportedly, a hired bodyguard to the Queen. The hired bodyguard has been repeatedly, targeting her, she resisting, in mate friendship behavior, as observed by staff. The staff members have repeatedly caught them both in mate friendly compromising positions. She acting mad once caught as usual. The staff weren't fooled by the deception of she was cheating on her husband as flaunted to their faces by the bodyguard after being caught. Besides there's multiple recordings of the bodyguard admitting to some other bodyguards in the service of wanting the Queen as his wife. And an admittance of doing what it takes to break up her marriage to the King so he could have her as his."
He frowned hearing that as Warwick paused to clear his throat and added "There's a recording of the Queen acting very hysterically upset and out of it not aware of her surroundings while walking in the hallway. The not aware status was determined by judging by the way the Queen bumped into things while weave walking in the hallway after leaving the King's office. She was overheard by staff to have a nasty public argument with the King in front of the staff meeting there, just prior to the bodyguard found her. The recorders show the bodyguard getting the Queen into some gym room. She was determined to be appearing to not realize that she was brought to the gym room with no recorders to indicate on what happened in there. The bodyguard apparently mated with her and once done with the mating appeared to be aware of her out of it status by recorded carrying her out of the room she appearing to look like she had passed out. The recorders tracked him down several hallways appearing to head towards the back entrance of the house. It was where the King on a coincidence was already there who got the bodyguard to give up the Queen who was carried to their bedroom. Two hours later the King came out of the bedroom looking angry and went out of the house by the back entrance reportedly overheard saying that he wanted to take a ride around Capital City which his order was obeyed."
Guardian spoke "What's with the story of a miscarriage used for her second pregnancy?"
He eyed Warwick who spoke after giving off a cough "The second daughter's looks of skin coloring, hair, face and eyes were after birth apparently inherited from her Father the bodyguard. That inheritance would make people bring up questions that the King didn't want to answer to the public. Hence he was having the second pregnancy being known as a miscarriage. The Queen to this day to the King in presences of staff members has maintained a story of passing out in the hallway after getting very hysterically upset with her husband trashing her in some argument. She not remembering what happened after that or how she got to bed she found herself in it with her nightgown on."
He frowned to eye Warwick who spoke "As for the King fathering you he still maintains this story of going out for a lengthy ride in Capital City and ordering the vehicle to a hotel. It was where a popular movie production crew was reportedly known to staying for doing some filming work in the city for popular movies. That included the actress he met on a coincidence in the hallway who invited him to stay in her room. She claiming to have an extra bed which they wound up mating with each other in there during the night he stayed with her."
Guardian frowned as Warwick continued "Recorders show him entering the hotel through the back entrance and making a very strong beeline to a hotel room without stopping to talk to the staff members. He didn't tell the staff members on the way to privately register him as their supposed to do towards people who wish to keep themselves anonymous to stay at the hotel without press finding out. The hotel room he was seen beeline to approached and entered with a key card from a pocket on his person was reportedly registered to a well known international actress. She was reportedly said to be using a fake name by the staff. That status has always been given to that actress that numbered room whenever she checks in that hotel."
Guardian looked at Warwick despite the moonlight pale who added "I can't help you any more on her identity. Your Father and the hotel have been tight lipped on who she is. She has not yet publicity admitting to being your Mother despite your Father doing it and balking on showing you publicity. You judging by your looks have appeared to have inherited your Father's hair color including the unusual long hair length for males in the family. That despite your Father keeping his hair cut short. You have appeared to inherit his eyes' color but your face and skin coloring looks of you indicate it's inherited from your Mother actually."
He frowned to rub a hand on his cheek as Warwick cleared his throat and again spoke "The actress the King reportedly mated with conceiving you as rumored. She was rumored to have had some heavy cosmetic surgery done involving altering her face, adjusting her breasts' size and making her body thinner just prior to getting into the acting profession. This was rumored was from numerous Mahalia native actresses after they retire from acting old age have come out publicity admitting to this cosmetic surgery work already done on their bodies. That's just prior to getting into the acting profession offered in Mahalia. They'll look ideally perfect to the producers when auditioning for parts in movies. The producers as stated by them are looking for actresses with a certain appearance for those movies that have turned out to be worldwide popular among the Egyptians. It's a popularity of twin looks that's still ongoing at the moment hence the Mahalia native producers repeatedly making movies with the same type of females in them. That's thinking the looks are the reason why people are viewing those movies very heavily just to ogle the females."
Guardian frowned hearing that from Warwick which he heard a beep sound followed by the male adding "My time away is up, excuse me." 
He watched as Warwick walked out of the gazebo flashlight in hand shining in front of him. He sighed and got up turning on his flashlight and speed walked to home feeling chilled by the cold from sitting so long. Guardian got to his apartment to find the stairwell light blaring on again. He groaned and got inside checking for Bob and shut the door not seeing the cat around as he shut off the flashlight. Guardian turned on the living room lights near the door to find to his shock Daisuke standing in his living room with an all black eyed glare wearing his familiar Samira clothes on his form with arms folded eyes narrowing seeing him. Guardian groaned and pulled out the postcard from his pocket he forgot to shred and toss away and held it up in Daisuke's line of sight. 
Guardian spoke "The King's staff member who meets me privately from time to time regardless of location and where I am wanted a meeting with me immediately. That's after having someone waking me up by ringing my doorbell and leaving this taped to my door with it noted to go meet him right away. I did that and I'm back from doing it." 
He frown inwardly getting nothing from Daisuke who jabbed a finger in his direction and resumed folding his arms eyes still narrowed which he sighed softly. 
He spoke "The meeting was at the gazebo on the town green which is always the meeting spot during the dark time hours. I haven't met Warwick is his name during the day very much. It's actually fears of people from his past recognizing him enough to interfere with our meetings and converse with him too much. He's originally from West Allied, state as in born and raised in state all over before leaving to college in Victoria State. It is where he was roped into serving the King as a hidden representative to secretly talk to me from time to time during my time of being raised by my Mother raiser. This happened before it came out that he came from my Father actually which the secret meetings is still ongoing at the moment. I have met my Father on occasion secretly after it came out that he fathered me. I recently met him on the morning of Rita's funeral. He didn't seem interested in wanting to know anything about me during the meeting despite me bringing up the subject repeatedly."
Guardian clamped his mouth shut while eyeing Daisuke who again jabbed another finger aimed at him before resuming folding his arms eyes still in their narrowed look. 
He groaned softly "Bloody Hades, I figured out that Daisuke wanted the information said during the meeting hence he indicated this." 
Guardian again spoke the meeting's contents entirely from memory and then clamped his mouth shut while eyeing Daisuke. 
Daisuke spoke "Interesting. I admit it that I'm the assassin that took out that bodyguard in some fake assassination attempt done onto your Father actually."
He stiffened from Daisuke's admittance who added "Your Father complained to me during a private nightly meeting of a bodyguard he couldn't remove from service without killing him. The bodyguard he whined about was targeting his wife for mate friendship behavior who managed to get an offspring born from her. Your Father whined on having to give up the offspring the daughter's looks were twin to the male in question. Your Father was told that I would handle the situation of permanently. It involved putting the bodyguard down on a permanent basis in some fake assassination attempt on his life. Once the opportunity arrived for me to do that job with no time frame of when I was planning on doing it. I managed to do the assassination while the King was out in an open vehicle on the street for some holiday parade honoring King's day. By making the bodyguard suffers some heart stopping ailment using my mental powers. He collapsed onto the road dead getting people alarmed seeing that happened who got your Father out of the parade route and into some place safe."
Guardian gulped hearing that from Daisuke who continued talking "The presses had a field day with that incident calling it a botched assassination onto the King. They wound up going around that a government official wanted his titled position and doing what it takes to get it. Even if it meant having the King permanently removed from position in some departed status involving lights extinguished. Oh a government official of parliament was blamed for that botched assassination by the presses was voted out of office. The government official was reportedly saying some negative remark about the King to the public during a speech. The public wound up booing him at the time he gave his speech and them finding his speech boring. That government official wound up later killed in some car accident of his car blown up with him inside. The Dead Keeper said that the explosion caused his death. His death was really me causing him to have a heart ailment. By me stopping his car on a quiet deserted road trying to get a ride and pushing his car off a cliff after driving it to there with him dead inside which it exploded once reaching the bottom."
Guardian again gulped hearing Daisuke's confession who added "I admitted my secrets to you so talk on what you have been doing actually despite appearing to look law abiding?"
He groaned softly and spoke "My Mother raiser before it came out that she wasn't my Mother and the King, my Father died in a car accident of a drunk driver driving the wrong way on a highway. Drunkard crashed his car into her car head on reportedly killing her instantly. Drivers have come forwards to saying that they driving on that road have claimed to easily avoiding the drunkard's car after the accident was broadcasted on the local news. The drunkard some guy named Budge used some insanity defense during his court trial on accusations of manslaughter. The courts' three judges agreed with him and gave him one year of psychiatric counseling. He was later found dead drowned in the bottom of a lake wearing a chain around his ankles attached to a heavy cement block. The police have refused to close the case of Budge's death. I calling Budge's death a suicide, that there was a small row boat with intentions of holding something heavy on it, found on the surface just above where he was found. The police have instead have called the death a murder case. They have given me various ridiculous claims to me to why they kept the case open. That's despite my attempts to get the case closed or not believing me telling them it was suicide."
He groaned as Daisuke spoke "And where were you during the accident that killed your Mother raiser and during Budge's death actually?"
Guardian gulped and spoke "I was in the car in the back seat as ordered to sit there. My Mother raiser was angry at me for overstaying at a friend's house pass curfew time of ten o'clock. She having to come get me home due to not trusting me to walk home in the dark. Traffic was being heavy at that time of night. She was really angry at me and drove quite a bit erratically passing cars and speeding. The drunkard's car crashed into her car after she made an attempt to pass another car with no warning of the drunkard driving ahead the wrong way seen. That's how she died anyway. Besides I had nothing to do with Budge's suicide anyway." 
He clamped his mouth shut as Daisuke spoke "You sure of that, Guardian?"
He stiffened hearing Daisuke using his nickname instead of the name Guard. 
Guardian stiffened further realizing "I haven't told Daisuke the Guardian name or said it to Rita or Olivia either."
Guardian spoke "How did you get the name Guardian anyway? I never told you of that nickname or mentioned that name to Rita or Olivia or anyone in town when introducing me to people for the name Guard was always used." 
Guardian eyed Daisuke narrowing his eyes with suspicion in them as the male spoke "I’m a deity I'm supposed to know secret things people try to keep hidden. Guardian talk about what happened after the drunkard crashed his car into your Mother raiser's car." 
Guardian sighed and spoke "I don't remember exactly blacking out after the car was hit. It's when I came to finding myself hauled into an ambulance wearing restraints on my form and feeling very angry. Then passing out again with angry feelings whenever waking up restrained despite a change of clothes with the angry feelings keeping on hitting me and me passing out repeatedly over and over."
He clamped his mouth shut eyeing Daisuke who spoke jabbing a finger aimed at him "You will remember what you're in denial about, Guardian. You will remember what's involving the deaths of your Mother raiser and this male named Budge now." 
Guardian stiffened as a headache arrived hitting his head making him bent down groaning as he recalled fully his Mother raiser's car hit by Budge's car. 
He recalled to himself while speaking loudly not caring that he was doing it "She was still alive after the crash. I unbuckled my seatbelt and got into the front seat to check my Mother raiser over. She was looking at me with some odd confused look on her face. It was like she never saw me before along with having a gash on her forehead indicating a head injury. I wound up putting a hand on her throat gagging her she not giving resistance to that. 
I then wound up speaking in some odd voice tone sounding of your voice 'Your time on Egyptia has come to an end goodbye.'" 
Guardian continued to grimace as he added loudly "I got her to close her eyes and then grabbed her head with both hands giving it a sharp twist cracking her neck. I then went back to the back seat and buckling up the seatbelt and feeling rage hitting me. The rage made me unbuckle the seatbelt and attack the car door on my side of the car with great Egyptian strength bending it open. That along with getting out going to Budge's car to yank the car door with great strength then took the male unconscious out. I recalled started punching him in the front not caring on where the fist was landing till some electrical jolt hit me from behind. The jolt like feeling making me hit the ground becoming a bit paralysis. I saw myself lifted up onto a stretcher restrained and hauled into the ambulance. I continued to remember myself contained in some mental asylum." 
Guardian quit his talk to mentally think to himself "I recalling saying over and over ranting like a lunatic 'I am Guardian the Keeper of life and death.' 
I was ranting those words."
He straightened up his form removing his hands to eye Daisuke that spoke "Talk on what you remember involving your Mother raiser now." 
Guardian frowned finding Daisuke seemed to have confusion in his voice tone "Bloody Hades, this indicated to me that I spoke in a foreign language Daisuke couldn't translate. Hence his confusion sensed and silence heard in response to my talk."
Guardian obeyed talking the death of his Mother raiser fully. Guardian included what he was saying while contained in some mental asylum ranting words over and over. He talked on hearing himself saying including what they were.
He cut himself off as he saw Daisuke take a step back with a look of fear on his face that spoke "Budge, what you remember involving him?"
Guardian heard the nervousness in Daisuke's voice tone frowned but stiffened as he thought "I recalled myself after the trial swearing Budge dead and doing what it took to have him die for mercy killing to my Mother raiser. I remember something involving transporting myself from one place to another. The transportation happened after mentally saying certain words to a Tut and a Yerra to transport me. I was ordering a Tut and a Yerra to transport me to Budge's location for me to kill that male. 
I wound up hearing a mental male voice sounding in my mind ‘I'll wipe the knowledge of you and your actual purpose on Egyptia if you actually went through with the murder.’ 
I recalled finding myself not caring on the male's words to mentally give the transportation order. I found myself standing in a living room with Budge asleep on the couch that appeared to not wake up. I went to Budge grabbing the male's head and gave it a twist finding him dead from that neck snapping. 
I again ordered to a Tut and a Yerra 'Tut, Yerra, transport me and Budge's body to the nearest lake. So I can to depose into there.'
My order was obeyed finding myself in a row boat in the middle of the lake appearing to be anchored.
I told by a female voice mentally 'The anchor to the row boat is a cement block holding it in place.' 
I hauled up with great strength by chain breaking it apart and wrapped it around Budge's ankles before tossing the male overboard seeing him sink. 
I wound up ordering Tut 'Transport me home Tut.'
Tut sounded in a male voice via my mind 'Once your home, I'm mind wiping your actual purpose as Guardian and protector of the planetary world Egyptia. That includes being the hand that gives death towards deathless manoids living on this planetary world. Your purpose towards deathless manoids that have reached the end of their life's purpose of living will be removed from your mind. You're able to kill the deathless manoids is by any normal way of killing manoids. That despite them surviving such death attempts by other manoids doing it to them. Their death by your hand happens once the Guardian life force within you gets activated to do it. Hence you killing your Mother raiser your mental powers got accidentally triggered by the car accident and you killed her as a result.'" 
Guardian stiffened from the thoughts of the memory running in his mind to eye Daisuke still looking nervous. 
He spoke sounding annoyed "The cops are right. Budge's death wasn't suicide but murder. I just remembered doing that deed to him myself before willing myself to forget doing it." 
He clamped his mouth shut eyeing Daisuke who spoke "Excuse me. I think I should be in bed with Olivia before she wakes up and discovers me gone." 
He watched as Daisuke speed walked away and followed him to the laundry room door that slammed the door after opening and running out. 
He sigh thinking to himself "Daisuke figured out what my actual purpose was. I as Guardian of Egyptia was hence he nervous in my presence. He wanted to be away from me before I did anything involving ending his life." 
Guardian didn't say a word went to bed after stripping himself of his clothes putting on his pajama shorts. He was feeling the heat in the apartment running which he got onto the bed and shut his eyes after turning off the lamp and lying down passing out unconscious. 

Part Three: Discovered

Guardian came to hearing the alarm blare its noises and sighed waking up in the apartment he was staying in, in Capital City in Victoria State. 
He thought to himself "It was a lunar cycled month later after kicked out of staying in the apartment in West Allied state by Daisuke ordering me out. Daisuke appeared to be nervous but firm in the kicked out status order.
I recalled Daisuke got me a suitcase and told me 'You're to use for your shoes, clothes and personal purchased body hygienic items for carrying out of here immediately.' 
I wound up told 'You overstayed your welcome living for free. You should be living independently by yourself. You should be paying your own way and lifestyle instead. The apartment is going to be reserved for people who lost everything in disasters. It's for them to have shelter to get back on their feet and then move out once it was apparent. They had the money to afford a dwelling and a job to pay for it.'
I recalling that I packed everything I owned in the suitcase underneath Daisuke's watchful eye.
He wound up saying 'I protest to you trying to pack the alarm clock very strongly.'
I wound up tossing the alarm clock onto the bed. Once done packing got the suitcase out of the door as ordered by Daisuke.
Daisuke wound up telling me 'You're to hit the porch and wait for a hired driver to come pick you up.'"'
He frowned getting up from bed a large sized mattress on the floor on top of a box spring he found in the bedroom of the three room apartment. He used as his bed he lived in while shopping around Capital City finding the necessity items he needed to live there. Guardian recalled "The hired car in West Allied state arrived. 
Olivia gave me an envelope telling me 'You're to open while in the car.' 
I did and found a plane ticket to Capital City in Victoria State. That included along with a postcard from Elizabethan Island having an address on it with wording indicating on going there for residence living. The van's driver drove me to the airport which I got inside with other passengers. That after depositing my suitcase for them to process and getting through security to the plane finding it easily which took me and others to Capital City flying seemingly lengthy in the air to me. The plane's flight was making me bored enough to sleep which I did during the ride to Victoria state." 
Guardian sighed to go put on sweats of sweatshirt and a sweatshirt top to go to the hallway to his spare room. The hallway led to the living room stopping inside on the rugged floor to do his stretching exercises along with practicing his karate. He finished with the exercises went into the living room kitchen combination to the refrigerator. Yanking out some food bought from the grocery store yesterday and made his familiar omelet meal on the stove with the pan also bought from another store specializing in kitchen ware. He ate out of the pan once the eggs were finished cooked with a fork and then dumped the dishes in the sink washing them and ignoring the dishwasher unit sitting in the kitchen. That ignorance was towards the microwave parked above the stove in some silver color like the rest of the appliances were colored. He heard the doorbell ringing loudly went to the door to peer through the peephole finding Warwick to his shock standing outside that looked annoyed to him. He yanked open the door and without a word gestured for Warwick to come inside.
Guardian slammed the door shut and gave the male a glare speaking "Don't tell me that I'm going back to West Allied state after a month of staying here with no word or contact from you or my Father. That despite me repeatedly sends postcards to the King's residence each week on my location." 
He glared at Warwick that gave up a groan sound and undid his long jacket showing a suit underneath that pulled out a thick rolled set of papers held by a band. 
Warwick spoke "It’s a tabloid focused on West Allied state. Check the cover and you'll find one interesting headline and the story on page fifteen. This was caught circulating in Georgina at the regular newsstands. I can't say if the news it's holding will catch people's interests or not so check it out. Besides your Father is already aware of what that tabloid has been sprouting."
He frowned but undid the band tossing it on the counter to straighten up the newspaper appearing to be shaped like a magazine. 
He scanned the cover all over till a headline he saw caught his eye saying "I'm the Mother." 
He frowned as he turned to page fifteen to see it showed as a focus a picture of a well known older actress named Lila Lesley. Guardian frowned staring at the woman's picture finding nothing to indicate his face on her face. 
He read the article below her picture "I'm Lila Lesley the Mother. I was the one who had the King's first born son conceived in a hotel room. I hid the pregnancy from the public while hiding in Northern Territory in secret among natives of a small town who weren't that blabby about me living there. I later birth him in some one room cabin attended by the town's female midwife. The midwife wound up taking the baby as her own after she expressed interested in adopting him." 
He fumed reading the article further finding that Lila Lesley said "I agreed to give the baby to the midwife having an acting career I was hoping to further. I admitting to the tabloid I didn't need a child to interfere with my goals of achieving fame and wealth. I achieved my goals and then retired in West Allied state where I was from." 
Guardian felt himself annoyed instead of angry as he continued to read the article "I'm stated that I was coming forwards now, admitting to being the King's first born son's Mother. I was doing the admittance now to helping to settle the heated debate on who should take the throne once the current King was unable to keep his titled duties. I'm saying that my son should take the throne period." 
He found the article ended looked at Warwick after shutting the tabloid closed who spoke "She's not your Mother as stated in the tabloid. The King in the Queen's presence after shown this tabloid gave me the actual name of the woman he mated with in a hotel room. I'm not at liberty to say who she is to you yet. Lila Lesley according to background checks on her is an actual family member of a deceased government official that was fingered for a botched assassination attempt onto your Father too many cycles ago. Then later was found dead in some car explosion in some ravine after reportedly driven his car off a cliff into the area. The government official's family has reportedly claimed publicity that he was murdered and body dumped in his car rigged to blow up after driven off the cliff to hit the ravine down below. They claim murder saying that he wouldn't be driving on that road from some strong fear of heights. They claim that he has been known by them to avoid driving on roads like that due to his fear."
Guardian frowned hearing that as Warwick added "Mister Yamato was immediately contacted once the tabloid was found. He was told to have you kicked out of residence immediately. That along with you sent to here in Victoria State immediately by plane ticket provided by courier. The courier dropping it during an emergency drop off early in the morning is when he was contacted to do that kick out by delivering a message from me to do it." 
He stiffened hearing Warwick's words as the male continued talking "Your former President boss at Trick Party reportedly currently owns the building your living in. He was contacted via a Sally Lyons contacted to contact him to give you an apartment to live here rent free. Lucky you there was one available an eviction happening which you were given the apartment. It was him who provided the bed for you to sleep on. He did say through Ms Lyons that you were to furnish the apartment yourself with whatever furniture and necessity items you could afford via the monthly pension money your still on at the moment. He, through Ms Lyons had a document signed up stating that the monthly pension your on was to be given for life. Mostly via family members and Trick factory providing the money but was strongly firm on the amount to be given to you. The amount is currently fixed at six hundred pounds a month period. 
He also said ‘Your free to live in available apartment residences rent free in buildings I currently owns as long as you want to live there.’ 
Lucky for us he owns apartment buildings all over Mahalia. It shouldn't be a problem moving you around if the King feels that your hidden position is being threatened at the location your at. It's when he'll have you move either to out of state or to another location within the state." 
He heard a beep as Warwick paused then the male added "Time's up time for me to go so hand me back that newspaper." 
He obeyed putting the newspaper back into a roll along with the band holding it in place and tossed Warwick the tabloid that caught it putting it back into a coat pocket.
Guardian spoke "What am I supposed to do while living here?"
He eyed Warwick that spoke "Don't worry something will be figured out for you once it's obvious it can be done. I'll see myself out." 
Guardian watched Warwick walk out of the apartment gently shutting the door and mentally spoke to himself "I wonder what I'm doing anyway? I also wonder what my purpose is going to be other than being the Guardian of Life and Death."
He heard nothing to answer his question in response. 

Guardian frowned from the memory in his mind as he stood in front of a tall towering apartment building's doors while wearing a doorman uniform and hat on his head. That despite hair pulled back into a tail having his hair down frowned by the Doormen association. 
Also by the inhabitants of the building dubbed “Chelsea.” by the sign on its doors. 
The sign was in the city of Yekaterinburg surrounded by multiple tall towering buildings. 
He sighed softly thinking to himself "I wound up recalling getting a familiar postcard with an address written on it the next day taped to my door after the doorbell rang. The doorbell's noises wound up waking me up from sleep in my Capital City apartment. The postcard included an envelope behind it with a plane ticket to a city called Yekaterinburg in Republic state bordering West Allied state. I was expected to arrive at the airport in two hours." 
He frowned inwardly "I had to use a hired driver to get me to the airport after cramming all of my clothes and personal items into my suitcase. I wound up dressing in my familiar cheapo suit and getting to the airport on time. I had managed to get to the plane despite sensing myself spied on in the airplane's docking station while on the way to the plane I forced to ignore." 
Guardian frowned further as he saw a limo arrived parked at the curb in front of the building and sighed thinking "Bloody Hades, it's belonging to one of the inhabitants some starlet actress was living in the building. It was the female was always disguised by a head scarf covering her head and big sunglasses on her face." 
He eyed the limo as the driver got out and yanked the passenger door open showing a young woman coming out. She having her arms loaded with bags from stores he saw was within the city and walked towards his direction. He sighed seeing the woman looked like she was recently hired for modeling work judging by her tall as his height. 
He recalling from his mind of conversations overheard "Mahalia's stinking, snobby, modeling world had select females to reach a height requirement for models to take jobs modeling mostly focused into Republic State. Bloody Hades, whose idea, was it for me to get this stinking job?!"
He turned his form and opened one of the glass doors seeing another set inside cutting his thoughts. 
Guardian figured "I'll have to open that door as well judging by her loaded with bags." 
He waited as the woman walked inside. He speed walked passed her and got the other glass door open letting her inside she walking without giving him a thank you comment. He went back to his post resuming standing outside in front of one of the doors.
Guardian added to his thoughts "I'm feeling annoyed with having to do this job despite given a monthly pension. Why couldn't I do something else instead of this stinking job? It's not answering my question regarding my purpose in my life other than being this Guardian of Life and Death, Bloody Hades!" 
He continued to feel he further annoyed on arriving to Republic state to go to the address on the post card via taxi cab driver. He discovered that it was a house bordering a river with Yekaterinburg city sky line in view of it. Guardian paid the driver via hand print got out along with his suitcase and went up to the front door ringing the doorbell. Guardian didn't have long to wait till the door was opened by an older female looking around Rita's age while seemingly looking annoyed to him. 
She, he heard spoke "Your Guard Beers?"
He thinking to he "I recalling had spoken 'Yes.’ 
I was directed to go to this address. 
I eyed her who spoke 'The name is Daria Mustafina. I'm your landlord of the apartment your to be living in. I'll show you where it is.'" 
Guardian frowned from memory of her name to think "I recall that Republic state was formed by refugees of the rebellion war against the Tsarina at the time in Republics of the Tsar. Victoria State was formed for the Brittany natives to live there." 
He didn’t say a word to the memory as he added "I recalled eyeing Daria I assumed I'll call her as she walked out of the house and went around the corner me following. I was lugging my heavy suitcase the wheels broken following her to reach a set of stairs on the side of the house going up. 
She handed me a key and spoke 'Good luck.' 
I took the keys and hauled the suitcase up the stairs to get inside the apartment. I saw was a one room apartment. It was only furnished with a mattress and bed spring on the floor near the doorway entrance." 
Guardian kept his attention onto the cars driving by adding "I wound up looking around to find a door to the house with a sign on it saying 'Tenants no entrance.'
I was finding a hallway leading to a bathroom with a window and a tub shower combination inside and a large closet in the hallway. The closet included a small washer and dryer combination machine from the looks of it. I put away my clothes I was wearing inside the closet. I put away my personal items around the apartment and then put on jeans and a sweatshirt top. I went to explore the apartment fully. I found nothing to indicate food. I looked around and found a phone book sitting on the kitchen unit's counter and a phone attached to the wall. I gave the phone book a through check finding it involved the city's businesses along with food." 
He sighed from the memory to think "I wound up to figuring out that I had to call for a hired driver to drive me into the city for him to get food and necessity stuff. The doorbell rang while I was looking through the phone book. 
I went to answer finding Daria at the outside entrance handing me a folder she speaking 'Read it.' 
I obeyed to take the folder and watched her go down the stairs. I shut the doors in response making sure not to slam them. I found the folder contained what I was supposed to be doing while living at the apartment. It involved working around the yard after getting the necessity items from the shed in the backyard that also involved lawn mowing, shoveling the sidewalk and removing the snow from the driveway. I found that included making sure that the front yard looked neat to standards according to the instructions I found from Daria." 
Guardian groaned from the memory to focus onto the cars in the city's road driving by slowly some in the color of yellow indicating on taxis by the signs on the top. He eyed them warily as another limo stopped with a driver getting out stand near the passenger door and appeared to be waiting. He looked behind him turning sideways waiting patiently as a black haired older woman with some grey in her hair came into view with a teenaged blonde female with her. He wound up holding out the outer door for them both once he saw them. He stood and waited as they both walked out appearing to ignore him holding the door. That despite the teenager looking his direction and smirking before them both went into the limo by the driver opening the door for them. 
Guardian shut the door and resumed his position to think "I'm feeling myself annoyed with having to take this boring doorman job just to have something to do while living in Yekaterinburg. I was told of having a pension that was paying for my monthly rent entirely. I found out from Warwick later visiting me the next day after I moved in. 
Warwick had the doorman's uniform with him and told me ‘The job is at the Chelsea apartment building that was starting the next day.’ 
‘The job was reportedly’ according to Warwick ‘was paying you about a six hundred pound salary a month deposited into your private account for you to use for purchasing items.’ 
I found myself annoyed with the job how boring it is involving leaving me to think my thoughts to myself while being alert for people. I having to repeatedly stand there opening the door or doors for the inhabitants coming and going. 
My job of standing ‘Was for eight hours.’ as said to me by Warwick. 
Starting from the time of nine o'clock in the morning and ended at five o'clock. My relief some older male with grey in his hair would show up and take over for me." 
He continued to eye the scenery "I'm feeling myself bored with the job. 
I wound up asking Warwick 'Why wasn't I allowed to graduate from high school or get a diploma instead for an office job?'
Warwick had put me off by refusing to answer my question. 
That male wound up saying as a beep was heard 'Show up at the Chelsea apartment building the next day period for the job. Excuse me time's up.' 
Warwick then left me fuming at the male's ignoring my question." 
Guardian again saw a limo arriving that parked at the curb with a driver getting out stand near the passenger door. He sighed and twisted his form to wait eyeing through the glass doors seeing the lobby had a desk clerk and a security guard standing nearby. 
He saw the familiar female he assumed was a model by her height arrived into view while having some suit on her form and carrying a briefcase. He opened the door as she walked out ignoring him. Guardian turned to resume his position eyeing the model get into the limo and saw the driver get into the driver's side and drive vehicle away. He exhaled a breath eyeing his watch on his right wrist despite wearing white gloves on that was part of his uniform. 
Guardian found "I have hours to go before it was five o'clock my shift end time. Bloody Hades, I'm feeling annoyed with saddled with this stinking boring job. Just once I could have something else to do than this ridiculous standing for hours especially for eight hours."
Guardian sighed and mentally made his mind blank as he eyed the scenery seemingly lengthy while getting the door open for various people. He saw the people were mostly females of various ages who arrived via limos and always left by that vehicle parked at the curb. He stood as a taxi arrive parking at the curb to find the passenger an older male wearing a twin uniform as his that got out. The older male gestured him to go inside the vehicle by standing next to it. 
He obeyed getting inside and told the driver a dark colored skinned male with a purple hat wrapped around on his head "Parkville Street sir." 
Guardian didn't say another word as the driver drove him throughout the city to a bridge taking it and arrived at the street he was currently living on by stopping at the corner once on it. The driver refusing to budge any further which he sighed paying the fare by hand print after removing his glove. Guardian got out seeing the taxi turn it around and drove back into the city. He without another comment walked to the house finding it wasn't a lengthy walk. Guardian easily found the dwelling by the mailbox having Daria's last name blared on it while parked on the front lawn a good distance away from the front door. He went to his apartment letting himself inside and stripped himself of the uniform and hat hanging them both up in the hallway's closet. 
Guardian put on sweats "The sweats were loose clothes considered pajamas by the store in Capital City when I bought them. That despite calling them sweats." 
He wound up freeing his hair from the hair band Warwick gave him including the hairbrush for pulling it back while groaning loudly feeling himself freed from the confines of the hair band and uniform. He put the hair band in the bathroom's medicine cabinet with his hairbrush and then went into the apartment's kitchen unit. 
Guardian sighed again to think "Warwick telling me that the job was from Monday to Friday nine o'clock in the morning ending at five o'clock in the evening. 
I told 'Missus Mustafina is aware of your job and hours.'" 
Guardian groaned as he picked up the phone book feeling himself hungry and found the familiar place for food delivery by the ad and dialed the number. He was not able to grocery shop from not knowing of where to find the store in the city. Guardian wound up having to depend on take out food for meals in the morning of his shift and in the evening once done. 
He got the food ordered to his address mentioning "I'm currently living in an apartment of a house at the address via stairwell leading to it on the second floor. I will be paying via hand print." 
Guardian once done ordering got told of the food's arrival. He went to sit on the bed eyeing the front door and his watch seemingly lengthy till the doorbell rang. He went to answer finding the delivery male there wearing the familiar red uniform. He paid for the food and took it inside after handed it which the male left him. Guardian felt himself terribly hungry gobbled up the food once getting the bag onto the counter and taking out the nourishment to eat it all up along with gulping down the drink once done eating it. He threw out the bag and cup's carton into the trash can in the bottom cupboard. 
Guardian mentally recalled to himself "The folder Daria gave me said a dated day of the week of when it was trash pickup which was on Mondays." 
He eyed the calendar he managed to pack from living with Olivia hung on a cupboard door by a nail to see the date. He groaned seeing that the date was Wednesday and he had two more days of eating take out food and doing the doorman job. Till it was Saturday is when he could be free to travel around the city to shop for the items he needed. He groaned again of the job to go into the middle of the room on the black padded rugged floor and proceeded to do his stretching exercises. He wound up swinging himself up via acrobatic move and doing his karate till he finished everything involving his exercises and shut off the overhead light above by chain. Guardian went to lay his form down on the bed fluffing the pillow and setting the alarm clock for six o'clock in the morning on Warwick's order. It was knowing that he would need time to eat a take out meal and calling for a taxi to come pick him up and drive him to the apartment building. The taxi would be fighting the morning rush hour traffic just to arrive on time to the Chelsea building just to relieve the old male that was holding the doorman job before his shift. Guardian groaned and felt he weary shut his eyes passing out unconscious to come to hearing the alarm blaring its noises loudly which he reached over onto the floor shutting it off. He groaned finding the sunlight wasn't shining from out the window. Guardian blindly got up searching for the chain to feel it bang against his forehead. He turned it on after a lucky grab. 
He sighed and figured "I'll call for food to be delivered to me. I'll proceed to do." 
Guardian waited doing his exercises of stretching and karate not too lengthy this time as the delivery guy arrived with the food by ringing the doorbell he paying by hand print. Guardian ate the food taking his time then once done with deposing the bag went into the hallway into the bathroom to shower and get himself ready for the doorman job. He sighed once ready called for a taxi to come pick him up. He left the apartment locking the door and stood outside on the lawn feeling he annoyed as the snow fell. The taxi arrived and he got inside and it drove him to the apartment building him relieving the old male who took the vehicle in his place. He resumed his shift five minutes early again like he did the previous day. Guardian stood lengthy opening the glass door for various people coming and going. Mostly females including the familiar females he saw the previous day all getting into various limos coming. He doing the job he did till it was Saturday is when he was wakened up by the doorbell ringing to find the time was seven o'clock in the morning. He groaned and got up still clad in his sweats going to the door to yank it open seeing outside had snowed during the night quite heavily. He found a female standing on the steps wearing winter geared clothes that seemed aimed for teen females to wear. 
She, he heard speaking "My Grandmother has business in the city. She expects the sidewalk and driveway to be plowed by the snow plow entirely by eight o'clock every Saturday and Sunday. That's whenever there's snow as ordered by her as your landlord, Mister Beers." 
He spoke as the female made a motion to leave "Excuse me, didn't catch your name, Miss." 
Guardian eyed her as she spoke "The name is Maria Mustafina. Your landlord is my Grandmother who I currently live with only on the weekends. I wound up spending weekdays living in the city with my Father while attending college. Excuse me I'm expected inside." 
He didn't comment a response got into his winter gear and boots then left the apartment locking the door. Guardian wound up putting the keys into a zippered pocket of his coat. He stomped down the steps heading towards the fenced backyard finding the gate. Guardian yanked the gate entrance open to peer inside finding a shed in the corner. 
He stomped in the snow towards the shed to yank the doors open with force once arriving. Guardian found the familiar snow plow machine indicating it was fueled by liquid gas by the liquid gas cartons nearby it. That along with finding various yard work equipment inside that indicated on both muscle and liquid gas use. He sighed and grabbed the snow plow checking for the gas tank to see it was full. He hauled out of the yard to the driveway finding a garage. Guardian found the snow looked quite piled high by the street looking plowed. He got to work plowing the driveway as well as he could along with plowing the entrance to the street. He then plowed a path to the front door for Daria to take to the car without having to walk in the snow. He found the sidewalk and plowed that as well to find his landlord on the steps to the front door underneath the awning appearing to be inspecting his work by her narrowed eyes. Guardian didn't say a word instead plowed a path to his apartment's stairwell then once done haul the thing back into the yard to put it away into the shed. He went back out of the yard to find Daria standing at the foot of the steps waiting for him while holding a large brown cloth bag by handles with both hands indicating it heavy to him.
She thrust the bag at him speaking "Here's some food for you to eat instead of calling that fast food joint for nourishment. Also having them accidentally ringing my doorbell every time from confusion of where your apartment was." 
He groaned softly and took the bag finding it wasn't that heavy to him. 
Guardian spoke towards Daria as she made a motion to leave "Excuse me but do you know of any grocery stores walking distance from here I could go to?"
He eyed her as she paused and spoke "There's an outdoor Farmer's market on Kimmee Way two streets away in that direction." 
He saw Daria point a finger in a direction before adding "That Farmer's market is in always open for business regardless of the weather year round. Their open at eight o'clock in the morning and closed at the eight o'clock in the evening regardless of it dark or not. They take various forms of currency payment. Hand print is the popular payment for it. I strongly suggest you go explore your living area in this city today. Once you have the chance to do it instead of staying home and not doing much. Besides you should be able to find that Farmer's market after some exploring and be able to buy the necessity items you need." 
Guardian didn't say a word gave a head bob as Daria walked away via snow plowed sidewalks. Guardian went up the steps kicking snow off them by his booted feet then reached the top underneath an awning. He proceeded to kick the rest of the snow off and made sure it fell not on the snow plowed walkway he made. Guardian got himself inside the apartment to put away the food finding it seemed to involve a diet for organic vegan eating. He sighed and ate some of the food once he felt himself hungry then got his coat and gloves and hat. Guardian patted the coat's pocket for the keys finding them inside and put on the rest of the winter gear on and left the apartment. He wandered down the road in the direction Daria pointed was where Kimmee Way was. Guardian found the street with no difficulty finding the Farmer's market was underneath a giant metal tent from the looks of it. The tent was appearing to be shielding the Farmer's market from the weather elements. Guardian wandered around looking at the food that was being sold to people there buying them. He found various foods he liked eating to purchase some of them via hand print with glove off. He found himself given a cloth bag for the food till he got two cloth bags full of groceries. He carried the two bags full to arrive at the apartment to find a familiar postcard stuck to the door. He frowned but took the bags inside along with yanking off the postcard after shutting the door. Guardian sighed feeling the heat of the apartment on. He put away the food in the kitchen unit then peered at the postcard finding an address on it along with wording included.
He read "Dress nice for the outing. ID must be brought for Ed's that is a bar. It has a dress code. Please arrive there in an hour's time frame ASAP."
He sighed and got himself into his cheapo suit and then called for a cab to come pick him up. He waited outside in the cold not having the proper coat wear to go with his suited clothes. He found the cab arrived and gave the order of Ed's the bar's location. Guardian wound up hearing no complaints from the driver who drove him into the city. Guardian found the bar was in a street appearing to look like it was an office park for office work only from the looks of it. Guardian wound up finding the street having signs after a closer look standing on a certain dress code of what males were expected to wear when traveling in the vicinity of Ivanov's park. He frowned as eyed his watch finding that he had five minutes went to the bar's entrance. Guardian got inside to find the bouncer some big burly male taller than him but appearing to wear stilt shoes from the looks of him. 
He frowned as the bouncer spoke in some high female voice tone "I want your ID now."
Guardian obeyed finding his ID scanned seemingly lengthy by the bouncer he assumed was a female disguised as a male's eyes. Then scanned by a device in the bouncer's hand before handed back the ID then gestured to go inside. He went through a hallway to find a set of doors to hear not noises sounding inside which he found a large room once inside. He inside looking around and found Warwick seated at a booth slowly sipping from a mug appearing to look like coffee. Warwick continued to sip as he reached the booth to sit down and eyed the male. Guardian frowned as Warwick finished his sipping to place the empty cup on the table.
Warwick spoke "Drat can't seem to smoke while in here as law states. No smoking in public places such as this indoors. I have to settle for coffee to help my nerves." 
He sighed and spoke "Well what's going on for this meeting anyway?"
Guardian frowned with his lips as Warwick spoke in response "You know of the holiday King's Day coming up soon?"
He nodded his head to speak "I do recalling the dated day fully in my mind and calculated the days as later in three weeks." 
Warwick kept talking ignoring him "State governors have been since His Majesty Nikolas took the King's throne has been competing for him for him to select a state on King's Day. It's for a parade with him in it. It's still ongoing at the moment despite the scandals involving him and his wife with the theme of cheating if you get my meaning." 
Guardian groaned softly to nod his head as there was a throat clearing noise off his right. Guardian found a female dressed in a uniform of sexy maid with cleavage and short skirt in the color of black standing there that gave him a narrowed eyed glare. 
He frowned as Warwick spoke "Give my friend the health soda if you would please. Get me some more coffee while you're at it too." 
He saw Warwick hand the waitress the cup that took it and walked away. 
Guardian concentrated onto Warwick who continued "His Majesty had a lottery drawn each year with no set time frame before King's Day to determine what state would be hosting him for that holiday. Republic state was declared the winner quite recently."
He frowned hearing that formed the expression on his face. Warwick paused from talking to see the waitress put cups down in front of them. Him noticing the soda was in a clear glass and looked like water to him. He took a sip as Warwick sipped his coffee finding the soda was actually some version of sparking water. He sipped a bit before putting the cup down and continued to eye the male who stopped his sipping. 
Warwick added "The parade is as usual is held in Yekaterinburg regardless of what's going on in the city. It's that the city is large enough to accommodate the parade instead of the capital of Moscow. I believe your working your usual shift that day that the job description didn't include holidays off." 
He exhaled a breath hearing that from Warwick who sipped his coffee which he copied sipping his soda. He felt like he had an enough put the cup down and resumed staring at Warwick who stopped his sipping noticing his stare. 
Warwick spoke after a stare, continued "The parade route as usual lucky for you doesn't take the road where you're working but takes Main Street. It's the usual route for the yearly holiday parade involving their version of Lancelot. It's held on January first instead of the national date of May fourth. I believe that you should know why May fourth was picked for Mahalia to celebrate the Lancelot holiday nationally." 
He sighed and spoke as Warwick gave him a narrowed eyed glare "May fourth was when the nation of Mahalia achieved independence from Brittany officially. That happened despite already throwing them out on January first. Then later on the date of King's Day March thirty first officially crowning of some farmer who reportedly led the rebellion as King of the Mahalia nation. It took till May fourth for Brittany to officially recognize Mahalia as an independent nation and not underneath their rule despite resistance to that done after they were thrown out. The nation of Mahalia earned its official name of Mahalia after the King's wife of that same name. That was picked instead of going with the original name of Freeman's Nation as called by the Brittany natives after they arrived and discovered the island continent. This including discovering the original manoids living here on some primitive side. Is that it?"
He clamped his mouth shut and eyed Warwick who spoke "You forgot that the farmer Yevgeny Visser was originally from Brittany who traveled via boat to seek a new life for himself and his wife not agreeing with life in Brittany. His wife had twins a son named Ivan and a daughter named Georgina while in Mahalia just prior to starting up the rebellion that caused the Brittany natives' Queen's monarchy rule to be thrown out. Besides practically everyone knows the King's last name of whoever holds the title is always Visser period. That's regardless of what names he used to introduce himself to the public as the ruler hence His Majesty going with the last name when introducing his heir named after himself to the public." 
Guardian groaned softly as Warwick resumed sipping his coffee. 
He took the hint and sipped the soda thinking "Bloody Hades, I'm finding this soda isn't my taste to drink." 
Guardian felt like he had an enough of the soda, set it down despite not finishing the cup's contents. He shifted to look around the bar seeing it wasn't that crowded and had various males in it. That were served by waitresses all females wearing a sexy maid outfit that wound up making him think the bar was some male's club. He resumed looking at Warwick who appeared to finish his coffee as there was a loud beep sound heard. 
He heard from Warwick in response "My time is up. We'll meet again here as usual unless directed to go elsewhere. This bar is for males to frequent only. They don't seem to care who you are as long as you get something to drink from them period. So take off while I go pay the bill." 
Guardian obeyed getting up and left the bar going outside in the cold to sigh and eyed the time on his watch seeing that he had a few hours of daylight left. 
He figured "I'll see about exploring the city." 
He proceeded to do in his allotted time frame of an hour to think "I'm finding it was different from Capital City. Yekaterinburg from the looks of the city didn't seem to have any museums or tourist attractions for tourists to go to. The city seemed to be focused onto major store chains selling various items that seemed to be designer wear from the looks of them." 
Guardian wound up finding a male's suit store that had shocking prices in the thousands. 
Guardian grimaced finding that and walked out without buying anything as he thought "I figured that I'll go home." 
Guardian signaled for a taxi waiting lengthy as he thought "Why do I have to wait seemingly too long to me for one?" 
A taxi stopped near Guardian to his relief followed by a male getting out. He got inside and told the driver where to go finding the male parking the car at the beginning of the street and refusing to go any further. He sighed and paid the fare and then got out taking a walk through the plowed sidewalks to Daria's house to find the chimney blowing of smoke. 
Guardian figured "Daria must have a fireplace." 
Guardian let himself inside his apartment feeling the heat was on. He found the computer console for the heat and air conditioner in the wall behind a hidden door after feeling the walls for anything regarding hidden spots. Guardian proceeded to get out of his dressy cheapo suit clothes and shoes and socks and got into his sweats. That along with barefoot walked onto the floor going to the bedroom to spy a folding table and folding chairs in the room's corner he didn't see before along with something resembling a radio on top with a familiar postcard taped to it. 
He sighed and took the postcard to find a note on it saying "Radio's yours. Table and chairs are for whoever lives in the apartment renting it. Don’t ask landlord why she didn't provide furniture for she'll kick you out if asked." 
He ripped up the postcard and tossed it in the garbage can then with a sigh began making a meal of some food to cook in a pan on the stove. 
He figuring "The stove's electric from the looks of it." 
He felt himself terribly hungry ate the food out of the pan once done cooking, with a fork. Then washed the pan and fork in the sink not having a dishwasher for it then went to his bed to stand to notice a lamp parked next to his alarm clock. He wound up with noticing that his bed's blankets and pillowcase appeared to be replaced from the designs of them different. Guardian sighed to go to the bed to turn on the lamp and went to the overhead lamp shutting it off. He felt himself itching to exercise proceeded to do his stretching exercises due to not feeling keen on doing karate. He once done awkwardly got up and felt drawn to the hallway holding his closet. He proceeded to go to yanking open the closet doors to peer inside finding his suitcase was replaced judging by the color and design on it and looked bigger to him. Guardian examined the suitcase to find it didn't contain anything except had an ID tag saying his name of Guard Beers on it. 
Guardian sighed again figuring out "My Father must have provided the items for the apartment-"
His thinking was interrupted as the doorbell rang loudly. He frowned to dart towards the door noticing the window shade wasn’t glowing of sunlight he yanked open to peer finding an outdoor light on. He saw the light was showing Maria clad in winter gear on the landing he assumed was her. 
Maria he heard correct spoke "My Grandmother thanks you for doing such a good job with the snow plowing. She provided you some personal items in your apartment as a thank you." 
He spoke "Oh tell Missus Mustafina, your welcome for the snow plowing job I did." 
He eyed Maria who spoke jabbing a finger down "Icing the steps is you're responsibly by this bucket of salt provided. Excuse me I'm wanted indoors for dinner." 
He looked where Maria jabbed her finger to find a big bucket as she went down the stairs in the gloomy darkness hearing loud gibberish spoken from her that became fainter and fainter. Guardian figured she was speaking the Republic of Tsar's main language dubbed by the name of Raina while slipping and sliding down the steps ice on it. Guardian groaned and without a word got his boots on and walked out into the cold leaving the front door open but screen door shut as he grabbed the bucket. He proceeded to throw salt on each step counting ten of them then went back up to continue throwing salt on the landing. He then dumped the bucket inside the apartment after shutting both doors and locking it. He felt himself cold again went to the computer panel after removing his boots and dumping the shoe wear in the closet. He eyed the computer's panel finding the heat's highest number was permanently at a temperature of sixty five degrees and its lowest was permanently at the number of fifty. 
Guardian groaned figuring out "Daria set that being cheap with whatever was fueling the house for heat. I figured that she was using a fireplace for heat. It was due to seeing a chimney belching out smoke along with not seeing solar panels on the roof for solar power." 
He sighed and felt himself still chilled got himself in bed underneath the blankets to think "Ooh I'm finding that the blankets are better quality than the ones I purchased in Capital City. Thank you Missus Mustafina." 
He sighed feeling himself warmed up by the blankets leaned his head back to feel an indention of a book underneath his pillow. 
He yanked out to peer "Bloody Hades, I'm finding it was a religious book on Lance Richard that looked twin to the one Ms. Lyons was always reading in my presence." 
He groaned "I figured I'll call it by the name of Bible and read it when appropriate."
Guardian wound up setting the Bible aside down next to the lamp. Guardian eyed the alarm clock seeing it was still early for him to sleep seeing it was seven o'clock in the evening. 
He groaned eyeing the ceiling quite lengthy leaving his mind blank till a thought came to him "I figured I'll read the Bible to see what it was about." 
He proceeded to read a part in it that seemed to talk “There’s Goddess that seemed All Seeing One that created the planetary world of Egyptia and its gonoids that included creating humanoids from a gonoid evolved to become a manoid and forming the garden of Edenia in the island of Jacinda.” 
He felt himself tired set the Bible aside after folding the page where he was and shut off the lamp along with shutting his eyes. Guardian passed out unconscious to come to hearing the doorbell ringing which he eyed the time seeing it was five o'clock in the morning annoying him. 
He got up after turning on the lamp and went to the door swearing "Bloody Hades to whoever was waking me up at this morning hour!"
He wound up to cut his noises seeing Warwick on the landing.
He let inside and slammed the door while speaking "What's going on with waking me up at this hour?!"
Guardian glared at Warwick who in response went to sit down on one of the folding chair and gave out a big sigh before speaking "Your Father insisted on this meeting anyway some other actress not Lila Lesley has come forwards via a tabloid in Victoria state claiming to be your Mother. She's not actually. She's reportedly shares Ms. Lesley's views on who should be the heir to the throne which is you instead of your nephew in question."
Guardian groaned loudly hearing Warwick's announcement. 
Warwick continued ignoring his noises "Your Mother as an actress went by this name of Victoria Lynn as her professional name. She didn't give your father her actual name when he and she met together for a mating in Capital Choices hotel in Capital City. Your Father admits to meeting Victoria Lynn at a premier party for some blockbuster movie from Columbia. She was by his claims of slipping him an extra key card in his pocket and hinting on wanting to see him in private. It was said out of earshot of his wife seen dancing with a government official earlier just prior to meeting her for a mating. Victoria Lynn according to the Actors Association registry in Mahalia isn't listed on their lists actually as a Mahalia native. The Actors Association is for natives of the nation to register as the law states despite some background done on her." 
He sighed softly as Warwick paused to clear his throat then continued "As for Victoria Lynn's appearance description, your Father admitted that during the mating session she complained of him being rough with her implants. He figured out that her appearance was altered that she was still wearing her face's get up. She from description of her according to your Father appeared to be twin to the popular actresses' looks among actresses in the Mahalia nation. The look is currently is a big breasts' size, long blond hair looking pale and almost white and a sun kissed skin. She had a body that seemed a bit muscular and brown eyes instead of the blue eyes and rail thin bodies as seen from Mahalia actresses." 
Guardian didn't comment a response kept his mouth shut while folding his arms. 
He kept up staring at Warwick who added "Your Father has figured out from the background checked done on Victoria Lynn. That she's not a Mahalia native. The registry didn't have her name on it in either professional terms or actual name. He suspects that she originally came from Columbia. He suspects that she was trying to established herself as an actress in Columbia but not taken seriously enough. He thinks she went to Mahalia to further her acting career, how popular her looks were among the movie producers in Mahalia nation to produce movies featuring actresses with twinning looks."
He frowned as Warwick cleared his throat and continued talking "Unfortunately the Actors Association registry has proven to shown nothing from anyone named Victoria Lynn from Columbia getting any acting jobs within the Mahalia nation on their records. This suggested that the actress in question was just targeting your Father just for a mating ritual. She wounding up pregnant must have been an accident. Your Father said she told him she was on medication to prevent such status from happening despite taking them in his presence. He recognizing the pills his wife takes whenever they do any mating rituals with success of preventing pregnancies from happening each time." 
Guardian groaned softly hearing Warwick's words. Warwick he saw stopped talking to eye him with a narrowed eyed glare.
He spoke "So I'm nothing but an accident between couples mating. Ugh then how did the story of me come out anyway with the King claiming me as his son? I haven't gotten a clue on how this came out. That despite no word from my Mother raiser who always went by the name of Verona-" 
He was interrupted by Warwick hissing loudly before speaking "A hospital still unidentified to this day blabbed publicity that you weren't this popular midwife's offspring by an illegal DNA test done. It's still unknown on who ordered that test in the first place. The press in state of West Allied state where she was killed had a field day. They wound up blare all sorts of males on who could have fathered you. That blaring was done despite repeatedly not showing what you looked like to the public. I’m not entirely sure why they didn't do that anyway. The King was later pointed out as the Father after an unknown hospital in Capital City mysteriously acquired your DNA. They wound up tested your DNA against his DNA on orders of a voted out of office former government official. Reportedly a governor ordered that. His motive was to embarrass your Father for not backing him up in his reelection bid to the governor position. Your Father backed his opponent a female very strongly in case you wanted to know. This backing wound up humiliating this government official. He reportedly used the scandal of you being his son to show to the public that the King was some kind of womanizer soon after losing the election." 
Guardian hissed a breath loudly as Warwick paused from talking to give him a narrowed eyed look. 
He spoke that Warwick wanted him to talk "Alright from what I heard from my Mother raiser she always used the name of Verona whenever introducing herself to people in her midwife job. Always with me accompanied her omitting a last name and hardly cared if people assumed if it was her last name or not. She always used the name of Guard Beers to people's presences whenever she introduced me since I was age eight years old. I wound up taken along for my Mother raiser to do her job and that sometimes included on her didn't say anything on whether I was her son or not. As for my Mother raiser she habitually kept on calling me this name of Guardian in my presence. The name use was always alone period and never in front of other people. She always called me Guard Beers in people's presences. The name was used instead of just going with the name of Guard after introducing me to them. That includes even whenever she took me on her midwife job too. What I knew of my Mother raiser is that she's just a midwife who was deaf. Her job involved helping women give birth to babies at home and not with hospice care. Her job to help assist birthing took her all over Mahalia and not staying within a state on a permanent basis. Besides she had her eyes flare golden whenever she was angry with me misbehaving only alone in my presence period." 
Guardian clamp his mouth shut hearing a cough sound from Warwick and the male looking like he was trying to refrain from having a coughing fit. He eyed Warwick who burst out coughing loudly before clearing his throat. 
Warwick, Guardian heard speaking in a raspy voice "Excuse me. That eye flaring golden habit is common among the secret service body guarding Kings in position. I was just shocked to hear that your Mother raiser had this eye habit herself. I had knowledge of bodyguards using the golden eyed ability to intimidate people into doing things while keeping the King safe from harm. Actually so go on with what you know of your Mother raiser."
He frowned but spoke "My Mother raiser habitually since I turned fourteen had me present at births of off springs that instead of having me stay in another room out of sight with the other family members to calm them down from worries of the baby being born. She used me as some kind of assistant in births of numerous babies since I was fourteen. Mostly by helping the Mother push the baby out by getting behind the Mother seated. She was gripping my legs to push the offspring out. This during my Mother raiser had her hands on the baby to pull out once it could be pulled out. This after a certain amount of pushing was done. I did that as always whenever my Mother raiser was called to do her midwife job. My Mother raiser talked to me after she declared my age of seventeen despite not having any birthdays celebrated or a date set for that, on having me learn her job to take over once it, was obvious she couldn’t do it anymore. I didn't seem keen on doing that job. I kept on repeatedly telling her about my feelings and her ignoring me as usual. Besides I wanted a normal life of being a high school student to attend parties the schools reportedly offered and graduate with a diploma. I was thinking of becoming a karate instructor once I got my black belt from the karate school. The sensei aka teacher of karate has repeatedly having me assist on teaching beginners how to do karate and me liking doing the teaching."
He paused as Warwick gave up another fit of coughing before clearing his throat and speaking "Sorry I've been hit with these coughing fits lately. I do have a doctor's appointment scheduled later to figure out what's going on. The doctor is currently helping me quit the smoking habit by various medicines taken to avoid doing it. Your Father laid down the law actually on my smoking and insisted that I quit period. I'm doing at the moment despite some difficulty of wanting to smoke anyway continue on your talk."
Guardian spoke "My Mother raiser had me taught by various hired college students to tutor me in various subjects instead of putting me in schools whenever we traveled all over Mahalia. I went to Finely Town High School in West Allied state after my Mother passed away. It was for lousy two cycles. They kicked me out once it was apparent I was nineteen using my age as an excuse. They refused to give me a diploma claims that I wasn't doing well on their standard levels according to them. I kept finding myself scoring high on tests they gave me in the classes I took. Besides I wasn't able to continue on the karate lessons my Mother raiser paid for unable to pay for them myself. So my belt rank at the moment is red which there is another belt to go before I reach the desired black belt. That's the highest belt rank and rank where people can teach karate after registering within West Allied state despite frowning on that with lower belt ranks."
He clamped his mouth shut to eye Warwick who frowned visibly before speaking "What kind of tests did Finely Town High School give you that you said to score high on? I'm confused on that." 
Guardian sighed and spoke "They claimed to me that the tests were the twin tests they used towards students to practice on before giving them the actual test to gain entrance into major expensive colleges. The tests were a must for high school students to do as law stated in Mahalia." 
Guardian frowned as Warwick cleared his throat and spoke "Seems to me that they didn't want other parents to get the idea of home schooling their kids for a time period before putting them into high school to graduate with a diploma. That's judging by them refusing to give you a diploma and kicking you out of school. It's probably when word got out about that home schooling bit and they kicked you out as a result." 
He groaned loudly as there was a loud beep noise he figuring it came from Warwick.
Warwick added "Time's up. I will be seeing you around medically permitting. I suspect that this cough is something else other than withdrawing from smoking actually. Excuse me while I see myself out." 
Guardian watched Warwick left the apartment which he locked the door behind the male. He went back to bed finding the time was about five thirty in the morning finding it was always within timed limits of being with Warwick in his home locations. He sighed and went back to bed turning off the lamp and throwing the blankets over his head once he turned sideways. 
He wound up shutting his eyes to think "I figured that I'll get more sleep." 
Guardian passed out unconscious. 

Guardian frowned as he mopped the floor of the bar O'Shea's. It was an exclusive females' only club while clad in tight shorts and a tight vest highlighting his muscular physique. His uniform was a must for males working at the bar to have and muscular physique included. He groaned as he finished the mopping up the messes left from the patrons the previous night. Guardian hauled the mop and pail to the kitchen dumping them into the closet after pouring out the bucket's contents into the closet's sink. He left the kitchen and went to sit on a bar's stool and got handed his familiar drink of water from the bartender. The bartender was a female who had given up the name of Sparkette while wearing a feminine version of a men's suit. She was having short all cloud colored hair that was cut like a male's regular haircut but in a feminine style. He noticed that she had earth colored eyes while noticing her breasts were appearing to be on the large sized. 
Guardian figured "From her aged appearance on her face and hair that she was a former Mahalia washed out actress trying to earn a living." 
He sipped the water from the glass cup slowly. 
He let himself to his thoughts "I wound on a Monday went to do my doorman job. I during my shift saw a male wearing jeans and a hooded sweatshirt got out of a taxi and barge passed me into the building. The male was ignoring my attempts to open the door for him. The security officer arrived into view hauling the male appearing to look zapped unconscious. 
The security officer speaking loudly 'I see you didn't get the memo from the boss about not letting this yahoo into the building. This yahoo has been repeatedly targeting an inhabitant for some obsessed behavior which we were told to keep him out.'" 
Guardian thought as he sipped the water "I didn't comment a response towards the security officer's talk. I went to resume my position with my eyes onto the unconscious male. I even glanced at the scenery in front of me to see the yahoo as referred get up in an awkward way. I saw the male darted towards me appearing to want to barge into the entrance again running weave walking like a drunk. I wound up seeing the male's eyes were completely shut indicating a spiritual possession to me. I proceeded to do karate onto the male to keep him out despite resistance. I wound up finding the male fighting in some jerky awful combative art version of my karate's moves matching me. "
He frowned "The police arrived and broke up the fight hauling the both of us into a van handcuffed. 
Inside the van the male was heard saying “Bloody Hades towards Tanya!” insults aimed at a female I heard referred as Tanya. 
I heard him mention 'Bloody Hades to Tanya for keeping me away from her and to sickening a doorman onto me to use as a punching bag.'" 
He sipped the drink to add mentally "I wound up spending the night in a jail cell at a police precinct. In the morning one of the cops gave me a change of clothes consisted of dirty stained jeans and a hooded jean like jacket I had to button closed. 
I got told ‘The Doorman Association has requested you fired from doing doorman duties.’ 
It's the press having a field day about a doorman that could fight people. That's despite them not identifying you yet. 
Your boss called us and said ‘Guard Beers were out of job period.’ 
The firing was for the publicity which wasn't what doormen were supposed to have."
Guardian heard ahem noise coming from Sparkette breaking him of his thoughts while holding the cup of water. He sighed and sipped the drink in a faster move entirely then put the cup on the bar to see Sparkette take it away. He saw her appeared to get the cup cleaned up before resuming leaning against the bar. Sparkette he saw resumed staring at him as usual with some faint giggling sound heard coming from her. 
He discovering as told by a fellow waiter "She has always done the look and giggling sound towards any of the waiters sitting at the bar resting from clean up jobs." 
He didn't comment a response to her staring instead looked away around the bar area. 
Guardian thought to himself "Bloody Hades, I wound up roped into doing this job. It was by a cop a female bringing me out of jail in the afternoon to into the bar before it was actually open for business. 
The female cop heard speaking 'Sparkette, get your boss. I have a male trained in karate. I want to know if your boss was willing to take him on for the bouncer duties.'"
Guardian sighed sensing Sparkette kept staring at him by the noises she was making he heard. He ignored her staring as he felt his hair now longer than any Mahalia's native's male's normal length was pulled back into a neat ball. It was pulled back instead of left down around his shoulders. 
The boss he learned "I have insisted on having hair regardless of length pulled back as a must for the male waiters to have. I insisted on having your hair pulled back into a ball like style." 
He looked around the bar seemingly waiting lengthy as other waiters totaling five of them wearing twinning clothes as his. The males he noticed had muscular like physiques but not as muscular as his who arrived into the room. They arrived from the kitchen entrance and began setting up the mopped area by putting various tables and chairs in its place. 
Guardian recalled "I wound up meeting the boss of the bar an older blonde female giving off the name of Shea who appeared to be my Mother raiser's age if she lived. 
Shea at meeting spoke to me 'I insist that you flaunt your body to me by stripping your clothes in some dancing move. I like to know how well you can do this to clothes but leave your underwear on while doing that. Baring of your privates is a no, no in this bar period only the body so strip.' 
I recalled doing some stripping and dancing of removing my clothes in front of her not giving me any comments. I finished my dance to stand clad in my underwear dubbed briefs with my top and pants off along with shoes on the floor.
I eyed Shea who spoke 'Acceptable. You're hired right away.'
The cop took leave of us and I got introduced to the male waiters along with ordered by Shea 'Go to the locker room and change. Show him where he's to go now.' 
One of the males led me through the kitchen to the backend showing a door to the locker room having a sign saying 'Males only, females keep out.' 
Inside I found was a locker room for males only by the bathroom is having expellers for males only. I was given the uniform after pointed out a locker to stuff my clothes and shoes in it." 
Guardian didn't comment any more of thinking as Sparkette's staring was sensed stopped. He stood up to eye the doorway entrance to the private rooms to attend the club in peace with female friends served by a personal waiter assigned to do that duties. He saw Shea walk out of the entrance that also led to her office which he stood barefoot like any of the waiters as the males went to stand in a line next to him hands behind their backs him copying. He eyeing her warily as traditionally done fifteen minutes before opening time of six o'clock to inspect the work of the waiters' clean up job and arranging. He started working there two weeks ago on weekdays with more staff of extra three males on Saturdays and only having Sundays off. That it was when the bar was closed for business like any other bar in the city as the state's law stated. Guardian kept his mouth shut as Shea appeared to inspect the place with her blue eyes narrowed. She appearing to not to miss any detail from where she was standing in front of the entrances to private rooms and her office. 
He eyed her warily "Shea had waiters who she pointed as the one doing the job poorly each week be assigned to entertain the female patrons on the stage for stripping off clothes given them to wear. The selected waiter was to do a dance doing that strip off leaving them clad only in some skin tight underwear like briefs. That had enough room for the females to put paper money into the waistband. This money bit was included being groped all over the place not sparing the sensitive parts while going around the bar to patrons. The stripper as their job title was to do entertaining the females for money. The job included kissing the females on the lips and acting like the male was mating ritual hungry towards the females to give him paper money in response. Shea as she insisted on being called to me in my presence in a private meeting soon after hiring me."
Guardian shifted his eyes towards the floor whenever she noticed him staring which he kept the habit. He waited for her to give out her verdict and decision on who was entertaining the females in the stripper job. 
He kept his mouth shut as Shea with an odd accent he had heard from any of the natives of Mahalia but unsure of what nation she came from "Job's admirable this time." 
He frowned at the familiar words she always given after doing an inspection followed by her adding "Guardian, I expect you to keep order around here and inform Sparkette of any problem arriving that requires my presence."
He sighed softly from the familiar words aimed at him as he thought "Shea, I heard always used the Guardian name to refer to me, without realizing it, was my actual nickname. The name of Guardian, Shea gave me was code speak for the name, I was to use while being in the bar attending to patrons. Mostly in use of needing to kick out patrons causing inappropriate behavior and kicking out males that snuck into the bar whether dressed as a female or not just to either spy on females or target them with harm." 
He gave a head bob in response to Shea's words.
She added him hearing her again ignoring him "Hunter, your doing the stripper job acting as a fireman this time."
He heard soft groans from the males as Shea continued ignoring the noises "I expect everything to run smoothly this time as usual without any problems. So man your stations and contact Sparkette if there's a problem that needs my immediate attention. This only must involve anything law breaking or inappropriate behavior done. Good luck. I'll be in my office." 
He saw her leave entering the entrance by swishing aside the curtain showing blackness behind and disappeared out of sight. 
Guardian frowned as he heard "Ugh can't wait to graduate college so I can quit this job and focus onto something else. It's degrading doing it." 
He recognized the voice belonging to the male dubbed Hunter. He saw the dubbed male Hunter go into the kitchen yanking off his vest in the process. Guardian wound up hearing groaning sounds from the other males who got into their familiar positions around the bar area. He went to the entrance's double doors that led to outside by a set of twenty steps going up off his right underneath an awning having the O'Shea bar name on it. 
He went to stand behind the closed doors with arms folded a glare on his face he recalled "I'm to do this job as ordered by Shea. I was to indicate that I was the bouncer to female patrons entering the bar once it was open at six o'clock. I was to keep that standing position there while looking around as usual before a waiter would come up to me and tell me to handle a situation. I recalled has always involved a patron drinking too much alcohol and acting inappropriate while underneath the influence of the drink." 
Guardian didn't have to wait long as five of the bar's familiar female customers the waiters pointed out towards him “They habitually frequent the bar every weeknight except Saturdays with Shea.” 
The females always arrived he saw were gathered in a group while wearing revealing clothes going off to use a private room as usual. 
He recalled told by Hunter "The boss would join the ladies for a chat and remain with them till closing time of two o'clock in the morning. The boss and the ladies she stayed with for a chat would all leave. The boss left responsibility of who to kick out patrons up to us to do it. This kicked out status would take anywhere from an hour to two hours. It's depending on how stubborn the females were on leaving. The females always resorting to using threats of being forced mated to the cops after they were told to leave. That's when the excuse of using the cops to get patrons to leave for good would happen. The excuse of using cops has always worked on getting the patrons to leave. They don't seem to want to hang around for a cop to remove them despite their threats of forced mating used on us." 
Guardian kept his position and glare on his face while eyeing the doors as various females entered the bar wearing clothing that always looked revealing. 
He thought to himself "The revealing status was the dress code required for the females to enter the bar." 
Some of the females he spotted were gathered in a group at tables. He noticed some were sitting alone at the bar served by Sparkette.
"The bar patrons" Guardian thought "Didn't seem to be in a talkative mood towards anyone around them judging by them sitting at the bar getting drinks from Sparkette." 
He looked around the bar and glared at the doors as various females entered and left the bar all wearing revealing clothes on their forms. Guardian got a female wearing a revealing maid uniform he recognized belonging to a male's bar club. He blocked the female from walking further inside by his body getting into her way as she tried to walk around him. Guardian glared at the female who pouted with her mouth.
Guardian spoke towards the female during breaks of the music playing loudly "Your dress is not appropriate for the bar's dress code so leave now." 
He glared at the female who pouted as he thought "I wound up recalling, Shea, referred as the boss by waiters warning me and other bar workers as said at an inspection 'Males from an all male only club bar called Tucker another street away have been paying waitresses a huge money pound price to enter my bar to scout around for females there. Then have the waitresses report on what females were inside looked like. This included reporting via communication device called a cell phone while hiding in the females’ bathroom to talk on the bar's patrons. This information includes on when the patrons were reportedly about to leave after asking the females for a leaving time. It's when the males would leave their bar and target the females once they were outside for various purposes. That sometimes involved forced mating a female on purpose after she was found too drunk on alcohol to do anything to stop it. '"
Guardian resumed his glare aimed at the female which he figured was from Tucker's bar who again pouted as he stopped his thoughts. He gently pushed her outside shutting the doors in her face before resuming his position to peer through the glass windows to see her shake her head and go up the stairs out of sight. 
Guardian thought to himself "I recalled fully on the boss telling me 'You're to refuse any female appearing to be dressed as a waitress or a maid. Her clothes are to be in a revealing way to gain entrance into the bar. Tucker the males' bar has some dress code for female workers that always involved them dressed as waitresses and maids in a revealing way.'"
Guardian eyed the doors and around the room seemingly lengthy while hearing the music blaring in some thumping tone. He groaned softly as he saw Hunter on model like runway stage in the back end of the bar already stripping away clothes in some dancing move that looked like a fireman's clothes wear but in some revealing way. He looked away hearing no change in the music to concentrate eyeing the entrance and around the room as usual. 
Guardian groaned softly "I feel myself getting bored with the job. Hardly anything happens with this Bloody Hades' of an excuse of a job anyway."
He saw three females while wearing sexy short revealing dresses arrived into the bar. He frowned as he saw the three looking around making his senses blare warning unexpectedly. Guardian eyed the females warily to see them go to table to sit and get handed menus of drinks by a waiter. 
He kept an eye onto the three females as if drawn thinking to himself “I’m wondering why I was staring at them.” 
The three females ignoring him look at them. Guardian looked away in response to his staring and resumed looking at the bar's entrance and around the room. He found himself glancing at the three females as if still drawn but kept himself from staring too much. Guardian eyed Hunter to see that the male was off the stage clad only in his underwear in skin tight black color. He groaned seeing Hunter going around females letting them grope him. He looked away in response as the females he glimpsed deposited paper money to hang partially out of Hunter's underwear before moving off to go to other females. 
Guardian looked away thinking "I'm feeling myself annoyed with this degrading status it does towards us males in this ridiculous job. Just wish for once I would get respect from while holding a better job."
Guardian felt his senses blaring in warning as an odd feeling hit while he was thinking his thoughts as he shift to resume staring at the entrance. He stiffened from the feeling to sense it gone from him. Guardian glimpsed an older male wearing pajama wear on his form enter the bar who he tried to block from getting further into the room ignoring his blockade. The older male he saw barged passed him and grabbed one of the three females that made his senses blare enough to stare at the female at the table by the arm. He saw the male yanked the female up in a rude way despite resistance from her. Guardian frowned as the female resisted being pulled towards the entrance. She seen by him was giving a fight of punching and kicking at the male. He glimpsed her friends he assumed were the other two females get up and appear to be trying to sneak away from the scene. Guardian found the two females caught by two waiters holding them firmly as he saw the third female was still being pulled towards the entrance by the older male. He sighed and signaled towards Sparkette who he saw was looking in his direction to cut the music by his hand making a cut gesture across his throat. Guardian found his order obeyed which he went to the older male having hands on a female's arm as the music stopped abruptly. 
Guardian reached them to hear from the male sounding annoyed "Katrina, you're coming with me now as I your Father orders you period!"
He heard from Katrina he assumed was her name while she was struggling to free her arm from the male's grip "You're not my Father but Stepfather! You can't control my life! I can do what I want so leave me alone now-"
He went to them interrupting loudly "Something I can do for the both of you hmm?"
He heard silence from within the room to sense people were staring at the scene from the staring sense blaring. Guardian formed an angry glare on his face faking his anger. 
The older male was heard addressing him "This is my daughter who's fifteen and shouldn't be in here-"
Guardian heard Katrina interrupt "I'm not your daughter! Let go of me now and leave me alone! It's my life and I can do what I want with-"
He exhaled a breath as the older male backhanded Katrina on the face appearing to quiet her. 
Guardian kept the glare as the older male spoke loudly towards him while keeping a hold on Katrina's arm "Excuse me. Katrina my daughter here isn't the legal age to drink. She shouldn't be in here. I aim to take her home where she belongs instead of out partying." 
He didn't comment a response as a loud voice broke "Who did Katrina come with this time?"
Guardian found the two females that were with Katrina at the table in the arm grips of two waiters who pushed them both in sight near him as the boss came into his line of sight.
He eyed Shea he'll call her instead of the boss wording by the waiters, who added "Thank you sir on coming into here and preventing another incident of underage girls drinking themselves drunk and coming out to be targets of males for some forced mating ritual. Bouncer, please see this Mister and his daughter and her companions out now."
He didn't say a word jabbed a finger towards the doorway entrance. He watched as Katrina still silently pulled out of the bar by the older male he assumed was her legal guardian. Guardian found Katrina and her guardian were followed by her two companions. He went to resume his spot near the doorway entrance and heard the music resume its thumping noises. Guardian sensed himself spied at. The sense making him look around the room seeing various too many females appeared to be staring in his direction appearing to ogle him. Guardian saw their expressions were of amusement while appearing to ogle him making him disgusted. He resumed looking away from their staring as the spying sense continued making him get annoyed with it. 
He felt annoyance take hold as he thought "Bloody Hades, for being spied on since I have taken this ridiculous job as the bouncer of the bar whenever it was open. The spying sense seemed lengthy and ended when the bar signaled closing time by the music ending. 
I would feel relief hearing a bell noise heard followed by Sparkette blaring her familiar line in her foreign accented voice 'Bar closed now so leave!'" 
Guardian kept up the bouncer job seemingly lengthy keeping his mind blank in response, till the music stopped is when there was a bell and Sparkette's familiar voice blaring loudly. He heard her familiar words which he turned to glare at the patrons. Guardian finding only three of the females was left including a brown haired female looking his Mother raiser's age going up to him and gently kissed him on the cheek. She habitually doing that to him as usual every time at closing time and leaving the bar through the entrance. Guardian heard soft groaning loudly among the waiters. Shea he saw arrived with her familiar entourage group with her. He heard the waiters cutting off the noises abruptly and saw the ladies leave the bar through the entrance. Shea, Guardian saw through the glass windows locking the bar's entrance via key and going up the stairs as usual at every closing time. He frowned finding that Shea had always left that way leaving the staff to take the back entrance through the kitchen. 
Guardian thought "I recalled told by Sparkette still using her foreign accent ‘The kitchen door has a programmed computer lock locking the door after the staff members left work through that door.'" 
He went to the kitchen going inside to the men's locker room to find Hunter there yanking off his briefs and spilling money all over the place. Guardian found Hunter doing the money spilling while baring himself and the male always looking annoyed. He looked away going to his locker to exchange his clothes baring himself. He always was ignoring the other males in the room chattering on what they were going to do during the day. Guardian heard the same commentary spoken by one of the loud mouth males dubbed Talker by Shea. 
Talker he heard was saying in some whiny tone "I can't wait to get home to sleep. This job is tiring." 
He wound up hearing from Hunter loudly "I have to study for my classes at the local college. I despise having the bar job to pay for my schooling expenses while taking schooling to get an office job period. How degrading. I can't wait to quit this ridiculous job."
Guardian didn't comment a response to the talk he hearing silence from the other males. He wordlessly got into underwear, jeans, socks, sweatshirt and winter geared clothes including his boots. He patted his pocket always finding his key inside along with ID card. He without a word walked out of the locker room to find Sparkette wearing a coat over her clothes. 
She was speaking her familiar words towards him whenever he came out of the locker room via the kitchen near the back entrance to the bar "Walk me home will you?"
Guardian sighed and obeyed walking out of the bar with Sparkette to find them in a graffiti alleyway as usual. He didn't protest as she took his arm and led the way him silently not talking towards her. 
She heard commenting from time to time her familiar words "Whoever the boss ropes into doing the stripping job is expected to get a certain quota of pounds from the patrons. That quota must be met in order to keep sixty percent of the money with the rest going to Shea herself to help run the bar." 
He heard the familiar words from Sparkette as usual remained silent.
Guardian wound up only hear from her unexpectedly "You got a name Guardian?"
He sighed and spoke "Yah I do. Its Guard no joke, that I was given that Guardian name. It's my actual nickname as said to me by various people after meeting me including some family members." 
He clamped his mouth shut eyeing the scenery ahead of them as Sparkette kept a tight hold on his arm and heard from her "Sparkette isn't my actual name despite dubbed that when I tried out for parts in the acting industry in Mahalia. It's Kassenia actually. What's your last name anyway?"
Guardian frowned and spoke "Its Beers as in Guard Beers." 
He sensed Sparkette stiffen from his admittance by her hand on his arm. Guardian heard nothing from her again. They reached a public street looking deserted with cars parked at the curb on both sides. 
He didn't comment a response as Sparkette spoke shocking him "So you know who your parents are anyway?"
Guardian spoke feeling fed up with lying "Sorry can't say for privacy reasons."
Guardian kept his mouth shut as Sparkette led him to a building connected with other buildings in a row with stairs leading up to it. He stood and waited as Sparkette kept her hold onto his arm and found he looking at her. 
She spoke, Guardian seeing her looking at him "Do you know anyone named Victoria Lynn?"
Guardian stiffened with shock hearing her speak the name as he spoke "I do know who that is. She's my Mother actually some actress who gave me up for adoption."
He frowned as Sparkette hugged him unexpectedly shocking him. 
She spoke after breaking off the hugging status to Guardian's shock "One of the female patrons at the bar asked me to ask you various questions. It's thinking that you’re her son she gave up judging by the looks of her face seen on your face." 
He broke off Sparkette's hold on his arm and spoke "That older female that always kisses my cheek before leaving the bar. It was her wasn't it?"
He eyed Sparkette who spoke "That female in question who kisses your cheek isn't the one who asked me to ask you questions actually. She habitually does that to whoever does the bouncer job. And sorry I can't tell you which of the females asked me to ask you these questions. I have to tell her your responses first then action will be taken for a meeting actually."
Guardian sighed and didn't say a word as he saw Sparkette to her apartment inside going up three flights of stairs looking seedy and disgusting to him. That along with seeing people he assumed were drunkards lying in the floor of the landings looking like they were passed out drunk. He saw Sparkette inside her apartment by the door and heard her lock it after shutting it closed behind her in a door slam move as always after getting her to her apartment. He speed walked out of the building and took a quick route to a major street where there were taxis driving by. Guardian signaled for a taxi seemingly lengthy waiting ignored by taxis driving by. He found a taxi stopped near him to let out a female looking like she knew him while dressed in coat covering her form that gave him a glaring expression. Guardian ignored the glaring female in response to dart inside the taxi. He gave up his street address finding the driver parking the car at the intersection and refused to budge as always. He got out after paying his fare via hand print method. Guardian used the blaring city's lights to get himself home to the apartment's house. He finding there was motion detector lights on the stairs and landing to his relief. 
Guardian recalled "I wound up asking Daria to have the motion detector lights installed via electrician onto the stairs and on the landing which she wound up agreeing to that to my relief." 
He went inside the apartment after unlocking the door shutting it closed. Guardian locked the door then turned on the chain lamp overhead by banging forehead against it in his search. He stripped himself of his boots and winter gear putting them away into the closet before going to the bed. Guardian turned on the lamp along with turning off the overhead light. He groaned softly to get himself into bed adjusting the alarm clock to go off at the same time every day he worked at the bar except for Sundays. He threw the blankets up his chest and shut his eyes passing out unconscious after turning off the lamp.

Guardian came to hearing the doorbell ringing in an insisting tone. He groaned and eyed the alarm clock finding the time was six o'clock in the morning and not his wake up time. 
He grumbled "Bloody Hades." 
Guardian turned on the lamp and stormed to the front door. Guardian wound up peering through the peephole to find a male there visibly underneath the glaring light holding a postcard to Elizabethan Island up in view while appearing to be smoking from the looks of it. He sighed and yanked open the door after unlocking it and glared at the male he finding was looking different from Warwick by facial appearance. He saw the male had the twin clothes as Warwick who without a word stubbed his cigarette on an ashtray on the porch railing then pocketed the postcard. 
The male spoke as he glared "Mind if I come in?"
Guardian heard the familiar Victoria state accent obeyed as the male came into the apartment to sit in one of the dining chairs as he locked both doors behind. 
He turned to glare and spoke "What's going on with Warwick medically? He seemed to have some kind of coughing ailment in front of me the last time he visited me." 
He eyed the male who cleared his throat and spoke "The King gave all male personal contacts secretly communicating with you, to use the name of Warwick, period. It's currently undecided on what the name should be used if the contact is female."
Guardian groaned softly but didn't comment a response. The male he saw had some looks of Daisuke with the eye area looking twinning and skin color but had grey colored hair instead of all black by the first Warwick had. 
Warwick he assumed he'll call him continued "My predecessor had to quit, a medical issue hitting from his smoking habit. The medical issue turned out to be something else than smoking he had to take priority to further prolong his life. I'm not given clear details of what the medical issue is. Other than that the blame is aimed at his smoking habit for causing him to be sick in the first place."
Guardian spoke "Well what news is on the King I should know of anyway?"
He eyed Warwick who spoke "Actually I have news on your job establishment. It appears that word got out to the police that the bar was serving minors. The cops had the bar owner arrested an hour ago for breaking the law. The bar establishment O'Shea's as its called, in question wound up closed for further notice, according to the sign on the door. I checked your work establishment out after assigned this job by contacts related to the King himself." 
Guardian groaned loudly and clamped his mouth shut seeing Warwick give him a glare which he frowned visibly while eyeing the male. 
Warwick added sounding firm "That's not why I was sent to here."
He kept the frown visibly on his face as Warwick continued talking still using the firm voice tone "There's an accident with the King's plane on the route to Republic State."
Guardian gasped of shock hearing Warwick's words as Warwick continued talking ignoring his noises "The plane was flying from Victoria State went through some winter storm like weather springing up unexpectedly. The weather reporters have claimed when checked that there wouldn't be such a storm. The plane's distress signal was detected blaring before cut off along with other communications to the plane ignored. The plane was presumed crashed into Helene national park according to the distress signal traced to there. I'm still awaiting word of if the searchers will find the plane and see if there's any survivors or not." 
Guardian groaned softly as Warwick gave up a throat clearing noise before adding "The Queen and the King's offsprings remained behind in Victoria State. It was on orders of the King insisting that they shouldn't come with him to Republic state to celebrate King's Day. It's his reason to why he was on the route to Republic state by plane. Anyway last I heard from my contact related to the King is that searchers are currently in the national park where the plane presumed to crashed in. Unfortunately the searchers are fighting with a very snowy wintery like snow and ice storm hitting the area where the plane hit the ground in the park. The storm has seemed lengthy with its weather status hitting. Weather reporters have been claiming that the storm hitting the area is acting oddly. The storm observed to be focused on that park area instead of traveling elsewhere in the nation like such storms usually do."
He sighed and didn't comment a response as Warwick again cleared his throat and continued "The King did say unofficially that if he was unable to keep the King's throne title before his official male offspring heir was old enough to take his place that his oldest male offspring not declared the heir, would take the King title and hold it, till the heir is old enough to be declared King. The declaration age is sixteen according to the law set down on when a minor can take the King's official titled duties."
Guardian sighed again and spoke as Warwick paused from talking to give him a glare "Fine. I get it your point on what you're talking about. Anyway I must report that the bartender at the bar named Sparkette. She's a female talked to me to indicate that a female patron recognized me as her son from my facial appearance I'm assuming. I was told that the female patron told the bartender to ask me certain questions related to confirming that offspring Mother’s connection." 
He heard Warwick hiss out a breath as he continued "Sparkette indicated that she was going to tell that female the results of the questioning at the next meeting in the bar when it's open again." 
He clamped his mouth shut and eyed Warwick who spoke "Interesting what address did this Sparkette lived in? Perhaps I can get people to her to find this female she mentioned to you." 
Guardian spoke the address fully and added "It's some apartment building with drunkards lying in the stairwell landing appearing to be passed out unconscious. The building is in some reported bad part of the city for people living off the state. That's claims of some disability which is excuse to not get a job and have a life while they fuel some drinking habit." 
He clamped his mouth shut to hear a familiar beep sound from Warwick along with a ringing like noise to frown as the male pulled out a device from his pocket he assumed was a cell phone. He saw Warwick unfolded the cell phone sticking it in his ear. 
Guardian heard Warwick speaking "Yes?"
He frowned as Warwick's expression remained but the eyes formed a narrowed glare look before the male resumed talking "I'm currently at the location with the progeny at the moment whose already been told the situation related to the King himself." 
Guardian frowned hearing that eyed Warwick who paused then spoke "Fine. I'll tell the progeny of what you have in mind. I will put this order in action as soon as possible." 
He saw Warwick press a button on the cell phone giving off a beep sound. Then saw the male folded the cell phone in half and put it away in a pocket of his trench coat. 
Warwick spoke addressing him "Orders from the King's second in command is that you're to be transported to Victoria State immediately on a further notice. The storm focused onto the national park has managed to ease up its hitting. According to the weather reporters has appeared to stop for now. The searchers have managed to gain entrance into the park's area and are currently looking for wreckage of the plane including any survivors as well. So get dressed into something presentable now and shower while you're at it. You reek of female's perfume actually." 
He frowned as Warwick gave him a glare in response. Guardian went into the bathroom stripping himself of his sweats to shower fully. He once done showering brushed his long hair neatly after drying it by hair dryer. Guardian walked out to get his cheapo suit putting it on along with his underwear, socks and dressy shoes. Guardian walked out of the hallway into the bedroom eyeing Warwick who had resumed being on his cell phone. 
He heard Warwick's talk “I’m calling for transportation.” from the wording used. 
Guardian wound up hearing Warwick "I'm ordering the personal effects of the progeny be removed from the apartment. All evidence of him living there permanently removed."
He heard from Warwick after a pause "Let the landlord be allowed to keep the deposit to keep her mouth shut on the progeny living there." 
He frowned as Warwick noticed him and shut off the cell phone and put it away. 
He stood with arms folded as Warwick spoke "Have to wait for the driver to call that he's arrived. This is going to take quite a lengthy time so go eat something now. I can't say when's your next meal will arrive after you're safely transported to some place to wait on news related to the King himself so eat." 
He obeyed making sure to eat the food making sure it didn't spill onto his suited clothes. Then once done to find Warwick at the doorway entrance the doors open and gesturing him to come. Guardian obeyed following Warwick out into the cold of darkness. He glanced at the sky finding the dotted lights were beginning to wink out indicating sunrise was slowly arriving. Guardian followed Warwick to a black tinted windowed sedan parked at the curb. He got inside with Warwick. Guardian felt himself sleepy abruptly as the car was heard starting up by the driver's soothing voice in a compelling voice tone making him lean back in the seat shutting his eyes.

Guardian woke up with a start feeling Warwick's hand on his shoulder shaking him awake. He groaned of pain all over as he eyed Warwick after waking up.
Warwick spoke "We're here so get out now." 
He obeyed to think "I recall a dream fully in my mind." 
Guardian walked stiffly while grimacing from the pain cutting his thought as he followed Warwick out of the car. Guardian glimpsed the sun blaring through the windows of the airplane's docking room was. He exhaled a breath as Warwick led him to a plane parked nearby. He continued to grimace from going up the stairs as his knees whined in pain. Guardian got inside the plane to feel relief from sitting down. He buckled up his seatbelt finding Warwick seated in a seat across the aisle from him. He peered out the window while seeing the sun was fully above the horizon and appeared to already high in the sky. 
Guardian grimaced "Bloody Hades, I'm figuring out that my body was tossed into medical examination hence my all body pain." 
He kept his eyes out the window from being in too much pain to sleep. 
He added to himself "I saw in the dream a male figure wearing black clothing appearing to be pants wrapped around the ankles and feet but loose elsewhere. The male had on a vest that looked like armor to me with manacles around the wrists look up in the sky with long black hair, similar length to my hair length. I glimpsed the black male appeared to spot a plane flying overhead made a throwing ball gesture towards the plane. I saw snowy ice fell hard making the plane crash onto a mountain top nearby landing on the trees intact. I continued to recall the male jumped into the air and flew up the tree's trunk like he had some walking on the trunk's ability to reach the top of a tree. Then the male flew in the air with legs swinging, in a runner's jog. I saw the male's face was hidden from me showing it entirely black with yellow orbed eyes, in place of Egyptian eyes. I saw the male reached the plane to smash an entrance through tearing at the window and entered it."
Guardian sighed softly to think additional thoughts "I wound up dreaming or recalling what happened next is the male unsure of who he was got inside the plane where the crew inside appeared to be unconscious from the looks of them. I recalled spotting my Father awake struggling against a seatbelt pinning him to the seat with failure that appeared to panic further seeing the male reached him. 
I heard a guttural growling voice tone 'Your time as an Egyptian is up now.' 
I continued to recall my Father swearing 'Bloody Hades!' 
I heard my Father insult of Bloody Hades added 'Bloody Hades towards Meritanians!' 
I heard 'Yerra and Tut you stinking Meritanians! I'll get you for that for pulling this stunt onto me. That despite some deal made to let me be Egyptian instead of being Hades. That deal was put in place after I originally arrived to Egyptia as that vampire. I wound up taking the King's throne in Mahalia including originating that saying Bloody Hades. You got Owen manipulated to give me the throne with that male taking my place as Hades.' 
I frowned to continue to recall the male with the black face I figured was Hades as referred by my Father. I saw Hades reached behind his head and yanked off the face I saw was a mask. I saw Hades' Egyptian face was seen as a familiar face I figured from history books was King Owen himself. I found Hades put the mask onto my Father's face who didn't resisted to that sensing he was manipulated to not to resist. I continued to recall that my Father gave off a scream of terror before becoming still and silent after the mask was placed over his face. Hades Owen yanked my Father out of the seat putting him on the floor in a lying position. I saw ropey objects looking like ropes covered my Father which the Hades' clothes shredded off Hades Owen like water. Hades Owen disappeared in a flash of light which I saw clearly in my mind arrive to a beach fall onto the area appearing to be unconscious." 
Guardian kept his eyes out the plane's window as the plane flew in the air traveling to Victoria State he saw as he added to his thoughts "I recalled fully on Owen's youngness features changing into an old male with long cloud colored hair wearing clothes twin to mine on his form that was a suit. Then Owen I saw was woken up by a hand shaking the male's shoulder. Owen woke up to look at the hand's owner I saw appearing to be through Owen's eyesight abruptly instead of my own eyesight via dreaming memory method. I saw the hand's owner was a young male around my aged Egyptian appearance wearing odd clothing on his form that weren't seen among Egyptians in a long time. The clothes I saw consisted of blue tight pants highlighting the legs and black booted shoes that appeared to be easily slip on and off. I glimpsed a white dress of a red bird on the front on the male's chest. The male I saw was wearing a golden crown on top of the long black haired head having red jewels on it. I found myself looking in another's point of view via eyesight instead of Owen's eyesight. I saw the crowned male appeared to look at my eyesight point of view as if sensing me and made a hand chopping gesture. The dream went black and I wound up waking up from Warwick's hand's manipulation in the car feeling pain all over." 
Guardian frowned as the plane reached Victoria state's capital's airport while feeling the pain stopped bothering him. He saw the plane stop nearby a convoy of black vehicles all having black tinted windows creeping him out with their sinister looks. 
He got ordered by Warwick "We're here in Capital City, so let's get out of here."
Guardian obeyed leaving the plane to get from Warwick "Follow me. I'll show you which vehicle you're to go in."
He wordlessly followed Warwick to a vehicle and got inside the car. He found the vehicle was escorted by other cars in front of it, behind it and on its sides from looking out the windows as it traveled through Capital City. 
He recognized the vehicle was appearing to take a route to the King's residence as he thought "I recalled the King's residence when I last visited was dubbed Peaches by security. I wonder if they changed the name." 
The vehicle he saw went through an opening in the gate surrounding the house having armed guards escorting it on foot. He frowned as the vehicle drove slow on the driveway passed a forest of trees lining the driveway and stopped at the house's entrance from memory of been there before. Guardian saw a familiar female he recognized to be the Queen looking sad. He saw the Queen was standing holding a wrapped blanketed bundle in her arms. Guardian saw she had a female standing next to her that had looks of his Father's facial appearance he assumed was Olga who had a big frown on her face seen. He wordlessly got out of the car and walked up the Queen to stand facing her who appeared to grimace seeing him. 
Olga he heard loudly speaking "He's not bad looking anyway." 
Guardian spoke as if compelled by his familiar senses blaring again "I went around publicity using the name of Guard Beers with nickname of Guardian used. So tell me what name did my Father use to refer me to you anyway?"
He eyed the Queen who again grimaced fully on her face as he felt the feeling stopped hitting him.
Then she spoke "He called you Victor after word got out that he fathered you, are your official name to the public actually." 
Guardian frowned hearing the Queen's accent reminded him of Republic state natives' accents.
He kept his mouth shut and eyed the Queen who continued "Publicity Queens in my position were always referred by the name title of Queen Georgina which is not my actual name. It's Svetlana actually. I came from Republic state hence my accent. It's to explain to people never hearing me talk publicity. The no talking status towards Queens was ordered not to do any public speaking by a previous King I believe was Owen. He was holding the title at the time. His Majesty King Owen issued this status as an order that got taken up by Nikolas himself soon after he was crowned King." 
Guardian gave a head bob in response as the Queen kept talking "Your sister who was fathered by another male was publicity referred by the name of Victoria by my husband. I heard the name of Talia was used via news's reports in any way of them reporting on that subject. The Talia name stuck as a result despite my husband's efforts to use the Victoria name thwarted repeatedly." 
He frowned fully with his lips as Olga spoke after the Queen paused "I'm itching for a drink, so excuse me."
He watched as Olga walked off going inside the house. 
Guardian got ordered by the Queen "Come inside with me now."
Guardian obeyed following the Queen inside. He recalled the house's contents from memory of a personal private visit as an eighteen year old a cycle after the news's blaring of the King's first born son came out. 
He recalled "I personally met the King alone in an office after guided to there by the old Warwick title holder. I fully recalled the meeting." 
Guardian followed the Queen through the house while looking around. He pretended to look like he hadn't been in the house before as he followed the Queen. He met various staff on the way that did double take looks seeing him. 
Guardian mentally added feeling his senses quit their bothering him "I recalled the meeting with my Father. The King didn't speak much towards me instead at first appeared to be studying me fully. 
The King then spoke 'You're ordered to go hide from the public period. You will be paid a very large certain amount of pounds after a certain time period had passed. This will be done while you're in hiding. You're not to contact me or my current family for anything period.'" 
Guardian grimaced inwardly from the memory as he followed the Queen further into the house. 
The Queen led him to a door and she spoke "This is your bedroom. It's as set aside by the King for male heirs to live in. He was hoping that your nephew would take residence in the room once old enough."
Guardian stiffened from her wording to his nephew.
He spoke as she looked at him with eyes narrowed in a glare "Then you know of the deception my Father played on my sister Talia on acquiring her son to be raised as the heir while putting my other sister's son in his place. I already met Talia who doesn't seem to know of this sibling connection or the baby switches deception either." 
He clamped his mouth shut as the Queen spoke "My husband told me that he found Talia. Nick has repeatedly refused to arrange for a meeting between her and I to acknowledge this Mother daughter connection. He did tell me of the deception of getting a male heir from Talia after he presented me with baby Nicky for the first time. That's despite claims of a surrogate used at first. I refused to have anything to do with the baby till he confessed that Nicky was born through Talia which is when I accepted him. My Talia what name did she use while raised?"
He frowned to speak "She was referred as Olivia by her Mother raiser who's light was extinguished by cancer. Olivia is currently married to some guy named Daisuke Yamato." 
Guardian heard a hiss of breath from the Queen as he paused then continued "Daisuke Yamato wasn't fooled by the deception played onto Olivia. Or me lying on who I was claims of having an ability to detect lies in my presence. He sort of got me to admit everything related to me and my sister. That includes himself sharing various information of having some deity like abilities that involves his eyes changing ability and speaking in some creepy voice tone. He wound up admitting of outliving normal Egyptian life spans. Daisuke confessed to being responsible for some assassinations of people that were giving my Father problems removing on a permanent basis."
Guardian clamped his mouth shut and eyed the Queen who narrowed her eyes and spoke "Talk Victor on did this assassination job included taking out some pesky like bodyguard that was targeting me repeatedly in some mate friendship behavior. I kept on having to repeatedly refuse his mating behavior like advances repeatedly over and over."
He sighed and spoke "I got a confession from Daisuke that he assassinated the bodyguard using some mental power to stop his heart organ. This happened while the bodyguard was out in some parade guarding my Father during King's Day-"
He was interrupted "It figures that Nick would use that deity to do a job for him. Nick is paying the price by answering to that deity demanding his payment in response. Hence the plane crash including this odd winter storm hitting the area to keep people from reaching the plane for the deity to force the payment issue towards Nick himself." 
Guardian kept his mouth shut in response recalling his dream and felt compelled to not to talk about it instead eyed the Queen who added "Anyway I wouldn't be surprised if the searchers don't find Nick anywhere on the plane with the crew members all killed off by some mysterious way. That would indicates some non Egyptian ability and that the person who did the killing would show signs of gaining entrance into the plane in some non Egyptian way. This while appearing to carry my husband off the plane to elsewhere some place for him to serve this deity in question." 
He sighed softly and spoke recalling his dream and felt compelled to talk about it as the Queen stopped talking to give him a narrowed eyed glare "I figured that myself as well. I assure you that Daisuke had nothing to do with the deity payment towards my Father. This payment was done by another deity in question who has my Father in their possession at the moment. This deity wound up letting me knows of that via some dream while I was sleeping in a car ride to the airplane's docking area." 
Guardian clamped his mouth shut and eyed the Queen who spoke "Alright would you come with me into the bedroom? I want to talk to you privately. The hallways have recorders monitoring conversations and people. I'm told that private rooms such as bedrooms don't have those in place." 
He obeyed to follow the Queen into the bedroom. Guardian found the room seemed to be set for a teenaged male age sixteen from the looks of various objects inside. At the Queen's order locked the door and stood staring at her. 
She added he heard "Talk to me further on this dream of yours." 
He relayed the most of the contents including talk on Owen being Hades. He omitted seeing Owen transported to a beach and woken up by a crowned male. He compelled to not to talk about that scene. 
He frowned to see the Queen grimace fully on her face before she spoke "Actually some things you should know related to Owen and his wife. Nicole is her actual name was actually the daughter of Nick himself when he was Hades. He was going around as some vampire deity named Hades with an ability to cause snowy weather while living in Columbia. Nick was really close to his offsprings on Columbia. Nick has periods as Hades when he couldn't Father children despite it happening over and over. He after he left being Hades found that he couldn't Father off spring through mating ways." 
Guardian stiffened from the Queen's words who added "Nick as Hades wound up following Nicole to Mahalia, some connection of seeing her as family. He kept himself contained in Helene national park feeding off manoids that travel there. Nick always keeping them alive till Owen got old enough to announce an heir sought him out. 
Owen from what I was told by Nick wound up as Hades. Nick wound up taking Owen's place as King of Mahalia. Nick admitted this Hades connection towards me. He was having some allergy reaction towards taking in solid foods. Nick could only live on a diet of various liquid drinks including blood spoken to me. His admittance happened after I threatened to break up the relationship with him. He was pursuing me like other males were doing at the time. He always was refusing to eat the food in my presence that was cooked for him. He admitted everything to me as a result. I wound up choosing him as my husband despite males pursuing me heavily at the time. The pursuing was, won't go away strong rumors of me being related to the current Tsar. Mostly as an unknown relative's daughter which isn't the truth but a lie put in place by my Father a senior government official. My Father was trying to find males worthy of being my husband and spreading that rumor to get males of value to target me. This is how Nick wound up married to me in the first place."
He spoke as the Queen paused from talking "Oh interesting but what's with Olga's drinking habit?"
Guardian eyed the Queen who gave off a loud groan sound. He heard Nicky giving off cooing sounds before becoming quiet. 
The Queen spoke "Olga inherited Nick's desire to drink nourishment. This time the liquid focused onto alcohol. She wound up appearing to not having any effects from drinking more than a normal Egyptian female's tolerance for drinking that. Her body from tests appeared to be using the alcohol as some nourishment substance in place of drinking blood. Something I saw from Nick which the alcoholic use wound up affecting the baby she was carrying in some normal Egyptian female way. Towards females drinking during carrying which the baby switch wound up happening as a result. It was obvious that the baby was going to have a history of medical problems related to the drinking status making him unable to take the throne once old enough. The doctors did predict that the baby with his medical problems would have some problem involving developing properly as a normal offspring. They predicted that he might wound up behind in development including problems with thinking and grasping information. They claimed he would have some kind of mental health illness issue. The medical ailments were predicted by the doctors examining him to hit that would make him unable to take the throne hence the switch put in place."
Guardian frowned spoke as the Queen stopped talking to give him a narrowed eyed glare "Alright I learned of this baby switch deception from the doctor. He was monitoring my sister during her coma status before birthing the baby. This doctor blabbed everything to me involving the baby switch. He appeared to know who I was from the looks of me without an introduction said. The doctor didn't give me an explanation to how he knew who I was. I kept on repeatedly asking him for an explanation which the questions were ignored as usual. He went by this name of Hammad Ashar as said by my sister's Mother raiser. I wasn't able to get a name from the doctor, him ignoring my question in response. He has repeatedly changed the subject every time I brought up the name issue." 
He clamped his mouth shut and eyed the Queen whose eyes remained narrowed with suspicion in them. 
Guardian sighed and spoke "I'm being mysteriously monitored quite heavily by West Allied state's police force. It happened soon after a drunk driver slammed his car into my Mother raiser's car. The impact of the crash reportedly killed my Mother raiser. The drunkard was driving the wrong way on some highway. He was later found dead by a drowning death I call it suicide. The police have always said it was murder. They have refused to accept the suicide theory I kept on bringing up to them. This murder status was always brought up whenever questioned by the cops on the subject. I noticed the monitoring after it was obvious. This became obvious while out at high school students' parties in the state forest hidden from the public. The parties always involved illegal drinking and drugs as usual. I suspected this monitoring how easily the cops found the party spot each time to do their raids. They always avoiding on arresting me despite doing that towards other students. The students arrested have always been caught with illegal items on their person or in some state of making them impaired to walk normally. The police's chief got a hold of me at the residence I was living in, in a rented room of someone's house ‘You’re to avoid going to high school students' parties period.’ 
He mentioned ‘The exception of not arresting you would end period.’ 
I figured out the monitoring and found the monitoring continued no matter where I lived in Mahalia. That's from senses of someone repeatedly spying onto me. Even while I was out in public all over the place including at the jobs I worked to earn money for a living. A representative of my Father claimed to me that my Father had some sense of detecting whenever he was spied on by people. The sense didn't matter if they were hidden. Daisuke said that trait was inherited from Owen who passed it down to my Father. I'm not sure of how my Father can have that sense. I have the sense from what you said of Owen not fathering him." 
He eyed the Queen who spoke "Actually that sense was detected in your Father that appeared to have it. Nick displayed that sense towards me whenever we were out in public during our courtship him complaining of being spied on. That sense must be something a deity gave to Kings of Mahalia to have. 
Historical documents have said ‘Previous Kings have each complained of being spied on soon after they were crowned King.’ 
That sense was admitted by the first King Yevgeny Visser on his deathbed towards his wife Mahalia and son Ivan. Hence he reportedly able to avoid assassination attempts on his life by the Brittany nation's people attempting to retake the Mahalia nation back into their rule. The Brittany nation's retake attempts are still ongoing. Mahalia's King at the moment has some kind of decades' old secret alliance with Columbia's monarchy ruler from what I heard from Nick ruling as King. Columbia nation was once underneath the Brittany nation's rule which there was a rebellion and the natives threw them out and have been ruling in peace ignored by Brittany. I believe the ignorance is because of one of Columbia's previous monarch rulers was part of the Brittany nation's monarch family. Hence the Brittany nation not doing any retaking towards Columbia in response assumption that the nation is underneath their rule. This happened after one of their own royal members was accepted as one of the nation's rulers from a marriage happening as a result."
Guardian frowned hearing that as the Queen paused from talking to clear her throat then continued speaking in a louder tone, the baby heard wailing loudly. "I'll see that you acquire the proper clothing for the King position along with the schooling to learn how to hold that title right away. Excuse me I must go see about getting Nicky fed from the noises he's making." 
Guardian watched her leave the room with Nicky still wailing away. He kept the door unlocked behind her but shut. Guardian looked around the room with disgust. He kept finding the items didn't seem to be interested worth examining. The items he saw were geared towards teenage males starting at age sixteen. 
He thought "It was from having previous interests in the items and losing interests once turning nineteen years old." 
Guardian went to the bed and laid his form down on it due to feeling himself tired. Guardian shut his eyes to pass out unconscious to come to hearing an alarm clock blare its noises. He jerked open his eyes looking around and found the familiar alarm clock blaring the time of six o'clock in the morning by the digital numbers seen glowing along with an insistence knocking sound on his door. He groaned and turned on a lamp illuminating the room. He got up going to the door yanking it open to find an older male wearing some suit with a bow tie while having a cart in front of him.
The male spoke "Excuse me I'm required to come in for instructing you on the schedule the Queen has insisted it be kept period despite your titled position."
He frowned but opened the door wider allowing the male inside and shut the door eyeing him. 
The bow tied male spoke once looking at him inside the room "Please sit at the table. I'll give you your nourishment. I'll be giving you instructions of what you're expected to wear for going out in public formally and involves how you're to style your hair." 
He obeyed to sit at the table and got handed a tray holding nourishment from the cart. He was recognizing the food as normal breakfast food along with the drink. He felt himself terribly hungry ate up all the food. Guardian gulped down the drink despite senses blaring warning unexpectedly. 
He mentally called "Yerra!"
Guardian wound up speaking the female's name mentally repeatedly to feel himself ignored to his disgust. The male the butler he assumed was his position put the tray into the cart. 
He heard from the butler "Your scheduled breakfast is always going to be at six o'clock in the morning period. The time frame was insisted by Her Majesty the Queen. She insisted that you wake up to start your day by me or a staff servant. This wake up is mostly focused onto knocking onto your bedroom door and coming in with breakfast for you to eat via cart." 
Guardian felt his familiar senses blaring abruptly as he paused from repeatedly yelling Yerra's name. He figured the sense was familiar from Yerra's contact as he concentrated onto the butler. 
The butler added "I insisted on you getting yourself out of the clothes now before going into the adjoining bathroom for showering as part of your hygiene." 
He obeyed seeing the male give him a scrutiny look once he was naked. Guardian didn't comment as he walked inside the bathroom to find it contained a shower stall, a one person sink, and a toilet. He found the soap and shampoo in the stall appearing to be aimed for males judging by the smell of both of them. Guardian stepped into the shower he turned the water on to heat toleration levels. 
He heard from Yerra as expected despite his familiar senses blaring as always felt just prior to she talking to him "The Queen shouldn't have thought Nikolas was bragging on being immune to poisons she assumed he was joking. She didn't realize it was actual fact. The poisons are said to kill a manoid once in their system without the antidote taken after a certain time period." 
He stiffened from Yerra's words as she kept blaring "Nikolas is really immune to all kinds of poisons known to kill manoids including some unknown. He passed that down to you. He kept acting like he was sick from some poisoned status in front of people. Especially the Queen who had him poisoned just to retaliate against him admitting to fathering you. The poisoned status was just to control him like she's trying to do towards you in response. Oh hence there's poison in your drink which your body is immune to it."
Guardian continued to stiffen hearing that as Yerra paused. 
He sensed that she wanted him to comment mentally spoke "What's with the bit of me not acknowledged as the heir? It was rumored that the Queen was jealous towards the female who birthed me would target her husband with marriage on her mind?"
He continued to soap and scrubbed himself all over as Yerra blared "That was that Olga was implanted inside the Queen after repeated mating proved no results. The implantation was done secretly without the King's knowledge at first. This fact came out after the Queen wound up birthing her second daughter. The second daughter's appearance was twin to the male that fathered her. Hence the King told of that deception. Besides the Queen was really jealous of the female that produced you as the King's son. She used some poisoned status onto your Father. Just to keep him from announcing you as the heir. He has repeatedly acted sick from side effects of his body withdrawing from the poison hence it assumed that he was poisoned in the first place. Oh it was his idea to use Olga to carry offspring to produce a male heir which the Queen went along with it. The trick wound up backfiring from Olga's drinking habit affecting the baby. Your Father had to use that trick onto the Queen's second daughter despite repeatedly balking his wife's attempts to contact her female offspring. He wound up not telling the Queen that he kept tabs on the daughter. Your Father kept tabs in hopes she would produce a male offspring he would use as his heir despite already knowing of your existence back then."
Guardian frowned hearing that mentally spoke "Then what about my creation between my Mother and my Father being successful and reportedly some accident?"
He frowned as he heard a male voice blare in his mind. 
He figured belonged to Tut in response "That creation was no accident. It was actually planet Egyptia's way of wanting someone to handle those deathless manoids causing damage to her. As in removing them on a permanent basis despite her having her own efforts thwarted repeatedly."
Guardian continued to frown hearing Tut's words who added "The Queen has given secret orders of assassinating the female who birthed you. Her orders came out after the fact that the King fathered you came out just to keep her marriage to your Father intact. She's really power mad enough to want to have the King in position underneath her thumb. Hence she poisoning him along with able to make him a puppet of hers to do what she says. She aims to do the same towards you till her grandson is old enough to take the throne. Nicky to be influenced to ruled underneath her influence and teachings enough to change things around Mahalia. These changes despite people warning her through our influence would make the Brittany nation have no resistance to take over the monarchy rule. That including retaking the nation underneath them again despite their attempts still ongoing. Besides you showered enough. So get out now the butler is thinking that your a water waster when your not." 
He obeyed to get a towel drying himself then wrapped the towel around himself like a skirt and left the bathroom to face the butler who cleared his throat. 
The butler he glared at spoke "You'll find the appropriate clothes for wearing laid out on the bed sir. I may have to assist in helping you adjust them to presentable means." 
Guardian didn't comment a response removed the towel and put it on the bathroom's doorknob still watched by the butler went to the bed. Guardian found the clothes seemed to be another version of his cheapo suit omitting the tie. The material from the feel via his hands' touch was more richly made. He wound up finding the underwear and socks seemed to be cheaply made from the feel of them as he put them on. Guardian put on the suit having the butler assist on adjusting it to look neat. He didn't complain about along with putting on his shoes he found were some fancy sneaker to him. Guardian didn't complain to the butler tying his shoelaces for him tight on his feet. 
He spoke "Excuse me what's done about my hair?"
Guardian eyed the butler who went to the cart in response and pulled out a hairbrush and a hair band.
The butler he eyed spoke "You're expected to wear your hair neatly pulled back while out among the public for formal events including when wearing the suit. Your hair can be styled any way you wish for events that aren't required you to dress formally." 
He frowned but didn't say a word and took the hairbrush and hair band into the bathroom. Guardian wound up finding the butler following him inside the bathroom. He proceeded to brush his hair neatly as he could along with pulling it back into a tail held by the hair band. Guardian heard a sound of Tsk from the butler who took the hairbrush and yanked the hair band out of his hair to his annoyance. 
He glared at the butler who spoke "Your style of putting your hair back does not look appropriate. So excuse me while I teach you the proper way of doing it." 
Guardian didn't comment a response eyed the mirror in response. The butler proceeded to teach him on putting his hair back in an acceptable tail style including teaching him how to put the tail into an acceptable ball style. He wound up taught to use the hair band to hold the ball in place.
He got told "The ball hairstyle is habitually used by long haired Kings or heirs competing in sporting events. Such as one sporting event involved the right to compete in the Egyptian World Games which mostly involved racing a sailboat with crew aboard against other sailboats.” 
Guardian frowned as the butler got him to practice putting his hair up repeatedly in the appropriate way the male wanted him to wear his hair. 
Guardian spoke "Sailboats? Is that the traditional sporting event the King or heir competes in whenever hoping to compete in the Egyptian World Games?"
He eyed the butler through the mirror as he cleared his throat. 
The butler spoke "Actually that sporting event was proven to be very strongly publicity accepted for Kings or heirs to compete in when trying to gain entrance into the Egyptian World Games. Other sporting events for gaining entrance were very strongly put down by the Mahalia's natives. The restless natives insisted that they wanted their own people to compete in the games representing any sporting event that involves the King or heir expressed interests in. It doesn't matter if it involves just an interest in practicing that sport for recreational use and no interests in competing in it. Your Father had interests in this ridiculous sport of ball basket. It involves throwing a ball to get it into a holey basket above his height repeatedly. This involved watching people play games of doing this ridiculous sporting event while others were seen trying to block the ball from going into the holey basket over and over. Your Father even had bodyguards ordered to play one to one games against him in that sport for certain time periods of the evening. He played obsessed with body guards. The Queen had to come out of the house to the ball basket's court to order him inside for bed. She always was insisting that he played enough and should be resting. It's a pity that the Queen couldn't get him to drop his interests in that sport enough to consider doing something else. Oh well." 
He frowned but didn't comment a response as the butler added "I declare you ready for presenting yourself to the Queen in the Main office. I will be leading you to there as ordered. I being sure that you haven't been to the residence before.” 
Guardian kept his mouth shut as Yerra's voice blared in his mind as he wordlessly followed the butler out of the bathroom "Your Father had all records of your visit destroyed. That included taking out people who witnessed the visit through assassination means. Warwick the first one was actually poisoned by your Father to keep his mouth shut on the visit. That includes visiting you privately without the Queen's knowledge of it. Hence he taking up the smoking habit, it helped him tolerate the pain of the poison within his system. Unfortunately the Queen found out through manipulating your Father in some mating ritual to get him to talk. Like he always talks during such rituals like that happening to him answering some certain questions, about Warwick doing the tabs visiting since you were a youngster. She cut the visits short by hitting Warwick the first with another kind of poison. She's the one who told the King to order Warwick to quit smoking. Warwick the first is currently deposed on a permanent basis as in light extinguished as you say it, after the poison took effect through his system."
He eyed the butler's back without commenting to Yerra with him following. He taking a look around to pretend he hadn't been in the residence before. 
Guardian heard Tut blare "I warn you that the sickness of withdrawing from the poison that hit your Father always involves him throwing up his stomach contents. There's no set time frame of that happening actually. The throwing up was assumed to him reacting to being poisoned. Hence he thinking the same thing strongly enough to do what the Queen ordered him. 
We have managed to get people underneath our influence saying ‘You were actually immune to the poison and withdrawing from it.’ 
He has refused to believe those people every time this immune status was said to him from mind scans of him being told this." 
Guardian mentally spoke "I believe you that my senses gave me warning involving the nourishment I drank. My senses indicated the poisoned status. I had an incident of drinking some kind of lethal poison disguised as wine at some forest party invited there by a female. She insisted I go despite the party run by a male who was bullying me. This male kept on giving me some suicide themed stuff. The stuff doesn't matter if it involved talking or not repeatedly over and over. I drank that poison. I survived but wound up sick with throwing up later on. The bully admitted the poison in the wine aimed at me. He told his friends at the party finding it funny. He was said that the poison would be enough to kill me. He even claimed to makes the poisoning seem like I committed suicide. He used the reason of some girl refusing to date me which is when they left me lying in the forest. I wound up sick that night. The male left me with some stuff left to make it seem like it was a suicide when the cops found me in the morning claims that the poison would kill me then. I survived the poisoning after spending a few hours of throwing it all up from my stomach. I felt much better after that that I managed to get myself to civilization. A Samira female found me walking on the street while out with her dog got me into her house. I was giving resistance at the time. The Samira female wound up reportedly called my Mother raiser from recognizing me. It was from my Mother raiser doing a job for the family. My Mother raiser picked me up via vehicle. She scolded me in some angry mood for staying out passed my curfew time."
He stopped his mental talk to find the butler leading him in the hallway to the Main office as it was dubbed. 
Tut was heard "Yah I know what happened next which resulted in the car accident that took your Mother's life. I warn you that the Dead Keeper's test results said that your Mother had a head injury that was bound to cause damage. The head injury would make her a vegetable for life. The cops haven't said anything about her neck being broken .It's what they pinpointed was what killed her by you doing that killing."
Guardian stiffened hearing that as Tut continued "The cops also hid the fact that you killed your Mother by a price tag of monitoring you heavily via various ways. They are still suspecting you responsible for that drunkard's death instead of believing your theory of suicide."
He exhaled a breath through his mouth as he continued to hear "Besides those cops somehow must have figured out that you had some kind of importance of being kept alive at all costs. The drunkard in question was known among the cops in Cairo to be some deathless Egyptian breaking the law repeatedly. The drunkard kept on surviving people's attempts to kill him. That despite how much deadly force was used onto him that would have killed a normal Egyptian."
Guardian inhaled of shock hearing Tut's words that stopped talking and felt the mind scanning he assumed were what the Meritanians were doing towards him to stop. He and the butler reached the doors to the Main office which the male knocked on the doors a code of three knocks. He stood waiting as the door opened showing a male with short blonde hair wearing mirrored sunglasses and an entirely one colored suit of clothes. The male stepped aside widening the door wider and jerking his head aside to indicate on them both to come into the room. Guardian found himself going inside alone with the butler not following him. He found the Queen seated at the desk some look of calculation in her eyes creeping him out. He noticed a female nearby wearing some maid uniform that was covering her femininity. Guardian saw she was busy feeding Nicky via straw tube into his mouth he was appearing to suck the contents looking bloody to him. He noticed three other males in the room dressed and looks twinning to the male that answered the door. Guardian walked up to the desk and stood with arms on his sides eyeing the Queen with a frown on his face. He saw her look him up and down and fully looking at his face with the calculation look on her face. 
He got from her speaking "Your appearance is acceptable. I expect you to keep it up while out holding the King's position titled duties. The duties involving you having to look the way you're dressed and hair styled at the moment for events that calls for it." 
He gave a head bob in response and kept the frown on his face still eyeing the Queen.
She again spoke "Alright. I get to the point. Your Father's plane was found with wreckage smashed into a mountain from the looks of it. There were no survivors of that accident. The wreckage was found by a fire smoke billowing from it. It's how the searchers found the plane. It was found completely engulfed in fire indicating no one could have survived the explosion soon after it crashed. I'm sorry about this, Victor. 
The official story as said via broadcasts is ‘The plane had mechanical problems and crashed into Haunted Mountain in Helene national state forest bursting into a fireball killing all aboard.’ including your Father. 
This was publicity known once the wreckage was found." 
Guardian kept his mouth shut in response while eyeing the Queen who jabbed a finger aimed at him. 
He got thrust a metal bucket he gripped while speaking "Excuse me?"
Guardian felt a needle poke him in the neck along with restrained by two of the bodyguards as the drug's contents went into him then the needle was removed. He finding the needle's holder was from the female wearing the maid uniform while noticing a baby's crib nearby he figured was holding Nicky. He continued to hold the bucket as he felt himself needing to throw up arrived. Guardian threw up into the bucket repeatedly over and over. He felt like he threw up his entire stomach's contents and got the thing taken away along with given a familiar drink of orange juice his senses again blares warning. He gulped the orange juice down entirely due to thirstiness and needing nourishment from a weakness feeling hitting him. 
Guardian figured to himself thinking "The Queen is demonstrating that I'm poisoned." 
He got the cup taken away by force before he was finished with the contents. He resumed staring at the Queen with a confused expression on his face. 
The Queen, Guardian stared at spoke "That was just a demonstration of you being poisoned. The sickness is the result of the antidote injected into you to keep you alive on a temporary basis." 
He groaned softly to rub his neck where the needle's injection site was finding the area had healed up leaving no scar in its place. 
The Queen he heard kept talking "The poison I warn you is quite lethal enough to kill you. If you don't have the proper medicines injected into your system to keep you alive living longer. Don't bother asking if there's a cure for removing that poison from your system. I was assured there isn't actually. You want to keep yourself alive hmm?"
Guardian gave a head bob in response removed his hand from his neck. 
The Queen continued talking he hearing her "You will do what I say and what I see fit for you to do while holding the King's position. That's until Nicky is at the proper age to take over which is sixteen as the law states. Don't think of acquiring a female despite public pressures for you to acquire one. I will see that she whoever she is that attracts your eyes is deposed on a permanent basis. Even if she succeeds in snaring you into a marriage trap something I forbid you to do while holding the King's position. You get it my words Victor?"
He spoke "What about mating with females? I'm a man I have needs that only a woman can provide." 
Guardian clamped his mouth shut seeing the Queen's facial expression turned into a glare.
The Queen spoke "Too bad, you'll have to do without that mating issue period. I know of females would do anything to gain a husband. That includes getting pregnant with his child and doing what it takes to get the Father of her baby to marry her and accepting responsibility to the offspring's care. This issue will be ongoing towards you. Females have repeatedly been known to have tried that stunt onto various males’ mostly public figures in the government. Some of the females had success in breaking up marriages in the process including getting the targeted male to marry her. This includes having the targeted male as her husband for life despite attempts of divorce thwarted every time that was brought up." 
He frowned eyeing the Queen who paused from her snarling voice tone then continued speaking "The public polled is still scared on having a Queen leading the Mahalia nation. That's from what happened when Brittany's Queen ruled them as an excuse of still wanting a male to lead them as King. I aim to have you convince the Mahalia natives that a Queen can rule as well as a King. I expect you to do a good job in this period. I aim to lead Mahalia as their Queen once the public stops being scared enough to accept me with you in the King position leading the sheep to believe in this." 
He exhaled a breath hearing her reference to the word sheep for Mahalia's natives as the Queen continued talking "Contact Harrington and have him give Victor a tour of the house and its grounds. Including on where he's to go while holding the King position immediately." 
Guardian didn't comment a response kept his mouth shut as there was a door opening sound behind then a throat clearing noise behind him. 
Guardian took a look to find the familiar butler there that spoke "I remained outside the door. I was suspecting that Victor would need to be given a tour of the residence and where he's permitted to go as the King titled holder, Your Majesty." 
He kept his mouth shut as the Queen was heard not commenting behind him. He saw the butler gave a head bob. 
The butler added addressing him "Your Majesty, please follow me out." 
He wordlessly followed the butler he assumed was his name Harrington taking a tour throughout the house residence. He found Harrington showing him various rooms of where the King's personal family residence wing was involved with sleeping, exercising, and eating. Guardian was shown the rooms involving holding public events that involved dinners and parties including where people visitors were permitted to visit for a fee of seeing the rooms decorated for Lancelot holiday. He was led outside and shown the pool for swimming laps. The pool having itself underneath a huge balloon like cover which he figured it was for the weather. He was shown a small court for basketball one on one he saw along with a garden inside a greenhouse of vegetables and flowers scattered around inside it. 
Guardian spoke during the walk back to the house "What about pets? Is there any residence gonoids I should be aware of?"
He eyed Harrington who looked at him and spoke "Your Father had just prior to his courtship with Her Majesty had kept a dog for a lengthy period of time unsure of when. Her Majesty wound up indicating some terrible allergic reaction towards the dog on a visit to here. His Majesty was forced to give up the dog to someone else I heard reportedly put the poor dog down through some shooting accident. Your Father hasn't been successful on having any pets regardless of what domestic gonoid it is having fur or hair on its form. Her Majesty has complained of terrible allergic reactions to the gonoids in question each time she was in their presence. He did had to resort to having several water fish gonoids kept contained in water tanks for him to have something to take care of as a pet. There was a suggestion of him having a domesticated lizard. Her Majesty has reportedly tried to talk him out of having the lizard. The talk was some fear of the lizard gonoid. Something he didn't seem to listen to her about till after Olga was born is when he finally listened and got rid of them along with the fishes. He hasn't had any pets since he's been raising Olga. There are occasions of him secretly sponsoring rider gonoids used for racing. This sponsorship has mostly has been focused onto horses just prior to his light extinguished. I believe that you might be interested in keeping up the sponsorship in his place if your inclined now excuse me we must be inside for your meal." 
Guardian didn't comment a response followed Harrington to the King's private dining room to find the Queen there eating while seated at the head at the table. Guardian noticed the familiar female maid busy feeding Nicky via straw from a see through bottle full of red liquid. The color made him think the liquid involved blood. He found a tray holding nourishment next to the Queen off her left which he went to. Guardian found he terribly hungry gobbled up the food and gulped down the drink. He again got his senses blaring warning abruptly which he figured that the poison was in the drink as usual. 
He kept his mouth shut as Tut blared in his mind "Ooh someone from mind scans suspects that the Queen is some refugee from the war with the Tsar. It's from finding nothing to indicate her family in Republic state. The refugee status is from suspecting the Queen has basically been known to balk on grooming Olga to take her place as Queen from the moment the daughter was old enough to be influenced by her to believe her views. Besides I suspect that Nicky was created for the Queen to use as a puppet if her goals of achieving the Mahalia leadership position have been rejected repeatedly. Nicky will be a puppet in her getting her Queen title done. This would cause the Brittany nation to send a male family member to court her strongly enough to get them married. Then Mahalia nation underneath the Brittany nation's rule again with the Queen herself removed from position of power once this is achieved."
He frowned to hear nothing from Tut finished with his nourishment and eyed the Queen who appeared to be hungry judging by how fast she took in the nourishment before leaning back staring at him back. Guardian figured that he'll tell the Queen of Tut's theory related to the Brittany nation.
Guardian spoke "Just curious on how you're planning on keeping the Brittany nation's monarch ruler from sending a male royal to court you heavily enough to succeed in getting marriage happen. Then later having you removed from position of power and calling the Mahalia nation back underneath the rule of the Brittany nation."
He clamped his mouth shut as the Queen formed a glare on her face that got up in a fast move throwing her chair backwards with a bang sound. Guardian saw her got thrust Nicky who cooed loudly being held by her. He kept his eyes onto the Queen who shut her eyes and appeared to be willing herself to calm down from her angry mood hitting her. He saw the Queen opened her eyes. 
Guardian heard her speaking loudly over Nicky's cooing sounds "Alright I'll make an exception this time. I will order to the staff to find you a female with no ties to the Brittany nation's monarchy ruling family. She is declared worthy of being your wife enough to not to interfere with you ruling while holding the King title."
He gave a head bob in response to her words as she added "Excuse me. There's a regular staff meeting happening at eight o'clock every morning, It's as part of the King's duties to have in the Main office as it's called. The meeting there is for being updated on news related to the Mahalia nation and island nations underneath his rule including news on what the governors have done for their states. I'll introduce you to the staff so come along now." 
He obeyed following the Queen still holding Nicky with the familiar maid female following her, him taking the rear to the Main office. Guardian found the familiar four males in the room but appeared to be in the room's corners. The four males he saw were looking like they were trying to be discreet in hiding. He noticed that there were about six people gathered scattered around the room in front of the desk. Guardian wound up noticing one was wearing a fancy uniform that indicated the military to him. He felt himself confused to which military branch the uniform indicated and kept his mouth shut. He frowned as the staff members he assumed were they did double take looks seeing him in the room. Guardian saw one of the four bodyguards shut the doors to the office behind him after entering the room him noticing. Guardian eyed the Queen who went to a bassinet and put Nicky inside. 
She stood speaking loudly while gesturing a hand towards him "This is Victor, the son, my husband fathered with a female other than me. He is here to takeover the King’s title, the plane crash disaster of what happened to my husband that reportedly extinguished his light and his people's lights aboard extinguished as well."
Guardian kept his mouth shut as he paid attention to the Queen who introduced the staff members to him. He finding out that the military uniformed male was the Mahalia nation's military leader holding the rank of Brigadier General. The Queen gave up a name of Herod and didn't include a last name. 
He frowned as Herod he assumed he'll call him raised up a hand and spoke "Greetings Victor." 
Guardian heard a Victoria States accent from Herod as reached out his hand and gripped Herod's hand. He wound up finding the General pulling a trick of trying to get his arm behind his back. He easily resisting and using karate defense moves to get his hand out of Herod's hand hold. 
Guardian frowned as once freed from Herod's hand trap to find Herod speaking "Spill it! Victor, on what training involved karate and self defense you have. It's by you easily getting out of my hand trap. This hand trap was to prove that you have some training in that area to get yourself freed."
He sighed softly and eyed the Queen in response who spoke looking at him with eyes narrowed "Herod pulled this hand trick onto Nick and me at first meetings. He was trying to determine if either one of us had training in karate along with self defense. Neither one of us had that training from not able to get out his hand trap he played on the both of us. Talk now." 
He shifted to look at Herod giving him a narrowed eyed glare with arms folded. 
Guardian spoke "I received training in karate at age eight from various karate schools all over Mahalia. The karate training stopped at the declared to me age of seventeen by my Mother raiser. The stoppage was my Mother raiser passing away in some car accident me unable to pay for furthering the lessons. I reached the belt rank of red in case you want to know. There's another colored belt to go before I can reach the highest belt rank of black. That belt rank involves registering into the state registry to teach karate. I was planning on doing that the teachers using me repeatedly to teach beginners karate. I found myself liking on doing the teaching. I do warn you that I have kept up the karate teachings quite religiously. Also doing this stretching exercise which involves keeping one self's limber."
Guardian clamped his mouth shut once done talking to eye Herod who kept his arms folded and a glare on his face. 
Herod spoke "Interesting." 
He didn't comment a response as the Queen he eyed went to sit at the desk's chair leaving him standing. 
He frowned as she spoke "Secretary you ready to take notes as usual?"
Guardian eyed the secretary a female seated in a chair in front of the desk having a familiar computer pad in her hand with another hand over it ready to do typing. The secretary he saw gave the Queen a head bob in response. 
He sighed and focused his attention towards the Queen as Herod was heard loudly "Excuse me, Your Majesty, but I want to know what schooling did Victor receives so talk on that now." 
He shifted to look at Herod and spoke "I was home schooled by various tutors hired by my Mother raiser till she passed away. I went to Finely Town high school in Victoria State for furthering my education. The teachers there claimed that the tests they had me take involved students taking them to get into colleges.
They claimed in my face ‘Your test scores weren't up to our standards.’ 
I heard some rumor going around the school by various students overheard talking ‘A home schooled student scored high on those tests enough to get into some private expensive major college.’ 
Then once it was obvious I reached the age of nineteen is when the school kicked me out using my age as an excuse and refused to give me a diploma of graduation."
He shifted to look at the Queen while adding still talking "I wound up living in West Allied state doing some factory processing products' job at the factory called Trick Party or TP in Merryville for four cycles. I was doing that job while taking fall semesters of a night class for three cycles. This was involving getting my diploma from Western Community College. I competed three of the five required classes for that. I was planning on taking the remaining two classes but the college abruptly stopped holding night classes. It was rumored some female student claimed to be forced into a mating ritual in her car and wound up pregnant as a result. I hear she's keeping the baby. The baby turned out to be a male. She reportedly had some passing down some family name tradition involving males. I think she kept the baby from pressure from her own family to do the keeping status."
He kept talking noticing the secretary was busy typing on her computer pad that she was taking notes of his talk. 
Guardian continued "I later wound up laid off from my job after some disaster of a spinner storm hit the building with me first in line of a warning system. I was outside smoking a cigarette just prior to seeing the spinner storm's arrival. I wound up getting into the building to warn the employees and staff of the spinner storm. Everyone reached the storm shelter except for the President of the company's son. I saved the President of the company's son while contained in the bathroom for males. He was unable to reach the storm shelter on time. I wound up going to look for him while the storm was raging which I found him and saved his life in the process. The debris of the spinner storm caused terrible damage to my left arm hence I have a scar in the area. I was favoring my left hand when it comes to writing but from the damage I have to use my right hand. The doctors' managed during their rehab onto me got me to quit my smoking cigarette habit. I'm fine with people smoking in front of me enough to avoid being tempted in case you want to know. Besides it wasn't Warwick with his smoking habit that got me to smoke in the first place. It was peer pressure of being in high school trying to fit in hence I taking up the habit but I'm completely off it now. I was at first given a monthly pension of five hundred and twenty seven pounds after I was laid off from Trick I call the factory. 
I'm told by a Warwick ‘The President of the factory gave you a lifetime pension wound up including free uses of any of his residences' buildings he owns all over Mahalia.’ 
The money I earned from the pension wasn't enough for me to continue classes at the college. It took me practically half a cycle of saving my money till I had enough for getting into a class at the college and hiring a driver to drive me there. I don't have my driver's license or experience with driving a vehicle. My Mother raiser has repeatedly drilled into me to avoid driving period."
He resumed looking at the Queen who looked like she was interested in hearing his words. 
Guardian kept talking "Some cop whose identity is still unknown to this day after having their light extinguished ruined my plans by willing me some pet bat cat hybrid for me to take care of. I couldn't contest the will's legal order of not willing to fight it in court or wound up in debt of legal fees. Most of the college money I saved wound up blown on this gonoid and his care for two months I had him in my possession. Some vampire spider infestation hit my home a four family house I was living in the attic with rent mostly paid by Trick. The house wound up destroyed including all of my things too. The gonoid doctor titled vet on site informed me of a passed state law involving making it illegal for people to have wild hybrids as pets. The vet claimed to me that other states would follow suit with twin laws. This was usually done after West allied state passes any laws with other states copying them doing it. I know from my research on this subject at Finely Town high school for class assignments the vet wasn't kidding on this law copying. Oh I had to give up the pet from what the vet told me. I haven't been able to find out if there was such a law or if the vet was saying this talk to make me give up the pet on purpose. I also wound up living in some female Samira's house. Mostly living in an apartment in the basement living rent free for awhile the female talking me out of trying to sign up at a local college for getting my diploma repeatedly. She has claimed to me of needing me at her house. Her claim as always was to help care for her Mother who was diagnosed with cancer that later got her light extinguished. This female in question wound up adopting a son from the hospital who claimed that her original baby was killed by some medical mistake. She kept on clinging to me to assist on caring for her son. There was a rumor of a male reportedly going around town courting her heavily with marriage on his mind which isn't me anyway but another male actually. The marriage of this female Samira to this male wound up happening as a result of the female's Mother insisting to the female to have that happen while lying sick in the hospital. The Mother's light extinguished soon after the marriage took place. Anyway a contact from my father contacted this female's husband to kick me out and have me sent to Victoria State. That was related to some Georgina city's capital of West Allied state tabloid blaring about some retired actress claiming to be my Mother. I wound up living in Victoria State for a short time then sent to Republic state assigned some job of being a doorman. Victoria State wound up having another tabloid blaring the same thing but this time a different actress was used. I didn't keep the doorman job long enough only got fired. It was from getting into a karate fist fight with a male ordered to stay out of the building by one of the natives living there. I wound up assigned to some female patrons' only bar's bouncer job. It was based on my body's looks and training in karate. I was given that job on recommendation by a female cop introducing me to the bar and its owner. I worked there for two weeks straight till a contact from the King arrived. The contact told me of the plane disaster involving my Father. I also was told the bar closed and its owner arrested by police for reportedly serving minors alcoholic drinks. That's about it for my life." 
Guardian clamped his mouth shut and eyed the Queen who gave him a narrowed eyed glare making him frown visibly. 
She he heard spoke "Talk on a contact claiming to me that a bar worker some female bartender said something about a patron reportedly recognizing you as her son. The patron asked the bartender as the female's job title to ask you some questions related to that subject. That was just to confirm this offspring Mother connection and then later tell her the results of the questioning at another meeting at the bar." 
He sighed and spoke "Just to clarify something. My contact while I was living in Victoria State showed me a West allied state capital city of Georgina based tabloid having an article on an actress claiming to be my Mother. The contact said she was reportedly some deceased government official's family member. This is when the name of my Mother went by back then came out. I was told the name was Victoria Lynn. It was the twin name the bartender used when questioning me her questions on behalf of a female patron. My Mother appeared to be aware of the legal name I went by as Guard Beers. The Victoria Lynn name was used in her questioning after I balked talking about my parentage and admitted that name to her." 
Guardian clamped his mouth shut and eyed the Queen who formed a frown on her face before speaking "Talk on this bartender who asked you these questions such as her name and appearance looks. My contacts had no luck on contacting this bartender after you gave up her address. Her apartment had some male recently moved into her residence. The male admitted after heavy questioning that the previous tenant he not sure who had moved out abruptly without a last minute notice to the landlord. The landlord was some reported claimed to be an illegal drug lord by cops after a background check was done on the person. The bartender in question didn't leave a forwarding address to the landlord for where she went. She didn't bother to leave an address for the city's post office to mail her bills to after we checked them on that so talk on her." 
Guardian frowned hearing that spoke "She had the chest appearance of what the Mahalia movie producers were looking for in females to act in their movies. That is the look they still haven't changed despite reported retired female actresses admitting to having cosmetic surgery to make they look like that. She had all white spiky hair and brown eyes with an aged appearance of looking like a washed out actress. I assumed that status judging by her chest's size. Her chest's size was too large for a woman of her size from the looks of her." 
He clamped his mouth shut again and eyed the Queen whose eyes narrowed then she spoke "What name did this bartender use? I heard it involved something to do with electricity in some feminine term." 
Guardian frowned hearing the Queen's voice tone sounding of sneering to him.
He spoke "Sparkette was the name she used. She claimed that the movie producers dubbed her that whenever she tried out for their movies in auditions. That name must have stuck as her professional legal name from what I learned from her." 
Guardian again clamped his mouth shut while eyeing the Queen who kept her narrowed eyed look before she spoke "I suspect that the bartender herself is your Mother. That's her abruptly moving out soon after the news of my husband's plane accident was broadcast that the news said was what killed him." 
He stiffened from the Queen's words of shock running through him as she kept talking "The drug lord landlord on questioning admitted to having some set ridiculous high rent price to the apartment building. This Sparkette lived in that a bartending job she had wouldn't be able to pay for the rent entirely. It was suggested that someone else was assisting her on the payments. Also the landlord admitted on questioning that he had roped the apartment building's natives into doing some law breaking behavior in exchanged for a lower rent. Along with giving some females the charge of living rent free if they did mating behaviors towards him. This Sparkette in question paid the landlord the exact rent price each month for living there. She was found to never doing any law breaking behavior or anything mating towards him. The landlord didn't pressure her on that that the rent was paid period at a timely manner." 
He exhaled a breath and inhaled as the Queen paused to clear her throat. 
She continued talking "I suspect that my husband was contacted by your Mother secretly using a middle man. The contact was for helping her live in Mahalia soon after it became obvious that she was carrying you. I believe the midwife Verona was the go between for them contacting each other. People have admitted to me that Nick kept tabs on you soon after you were born. Your Father had someone contact you secretly once you were old enough to be contacted alone without your Mother raiser's presence."
He frowned forming it on his face to realize that the Queen wasn't lying on her words regarding his Father. 
Guardian recalled to himself "I wound up recalling seeing the first Warwick hanging around the cities and towns I was living in with my Mother raiser. She was raising me all over Mahalia while doing the midwife job. The first Warwick didn't approach me till after my Mother raiser's death to inform me of my actual parentage. It was after word got out via press of me not being the midwife's actual son." 
He again kept his mouth shut as the Queen gave him a glare which he figured she wanted him to talk.
Guardian spoke "Alright I admit it. A contact from the King was seen hanging around whenever I lived in Mahalia with my Mother raiser doing the midwife job. The contact using the name of Warwick didn't talk to me till after my Mother raiser's death. He contacted me once word got out that I wasn't her actual son. Warwick approached me for talks. He did inform me of my parentage just prior to the press started blaring me as the King's son. The presses always balking on showing any pictures of what I looked like or saying the legal name I used to the public. The contact whenever he wanted meetings would leave a postcard of Elizabethan island nation. Either in my residence's mailbox or taped to my door of where I was living with a location on it and time frame of a meeting. Some of those meetings involved the wee hours of the nighttime due to trying to keep nosy people out from interfering. The contact claimed he was known in one state of Mahalia for growing up there where I was living for awhile before moving to another state." 
He again clamped his mouth shut and frowned staring at the Queen as he heard in response "Interesting. Seems like His Majesty himself made a deal with the press on this business with the son he fathered. By His Majesty saying that he'll admit to fathering him but they couldn't show what he looked like or say what legal name he used publicity." 
Guardian felt himself stiffening from Herod's words as he continued to eye the Queen who spoke "Hmph seems like my husband was desperate to keep his son from being influenced from the public on being King. That includes keeping out the influence of known government officials who made no secret of disliking him very strongly to the public. They would have influenced his son to believe in their views enough to do what they wanted once it was time for him to take the King's title and duties." 
He again kept his mouth shut as Herod was heard sounding off his left "I believe that a government official must have bribed people to cause that plane disaster killing your husband just to remove him from his King position on a permanent basis. It's from some strong dislike towards him. I'm unsure of what they plan on doing towards his son Victor himself once he was publicity shown and declared King in his father's place." 
He felt himself stiffening from Herod's words as he continued to eye the Queen who rubbed a hand on her forehead looking like she was weary to him before removing her hand. 
She heard speaking "The public has made it clear strongly via polls that they don't want to be underneath Brittany's monarchy rule again. They kept bringing up how terrible the Brittany nation's ruler and Brittany natives were towards people living in Mahalia. This mistreatment was including mistreating their own people who were living here after coming from Brittany nation to settle here for a new life. The people have made it clear that Mahalia was to be ruled by their own ruler a male in the King titled position period. They refused to accept a female ruler ruling in the Queen position Brittany nation accepting females to rule their nation. It doesn't matter if the ruler is a male or a female as long as they have a monarch ruler period. Mahalia's natives made it clear that only a male can rule them in the leadership position. The restless natives made it clear that the Visser family and male descendants were to rule the nation period. They refused to accept any other family having a male to rule them in the King titled position. The people reportedly have been overheard over the cycles commenting on this subject all over the place including in my presence. They were heard commenting while I was growing up in Republic state and just prior to my Father announced me available for males to pursue." 
Guardian frowned hearing that eyed the Queen while keeping his mouth shut as Herod was heard "Victor publicity shown and coronation of being crowned King will happen as soon as that can be arranged at once. The public will panic of a takeover from the Brittany nation's ruler. Brittany nation in case you're wondering, Victor, has for cycles made no secret of wanting to retake Mahalia nation underneath their rule. They have proven to be responsible for causing several medical incidents towards the Kings holding the title over the cycles. They have tried numerous failed attempts to influence his own male heir offspring to give Mahalia nation towards their national ruler once it was time for them to hold the King position."
He shifted to look at Herod who was appearing to be looking at the Queen who continued talking "I do warn you that Brittany nation will send a female with their ruler's influence to pursue Victor with marriage quite heavily enough to get him as her husband. They will have her use whatever influential ways on getting him to get Mahalia underneath Brittany's monarchy rule. This stunt was reportedly already tried on His Majesty's predecessor King Owen himself repeatedly. Some reported unknown named deity managed to prevent such a marriage from happening. This deity in question was said to mysteriously hitting those females with bad luck of medical ailments. The medical ailments in question took those females out of doing the targeting. The public was strongly disapproving on them being Queen with their medical ailment they were currently suffering."
Guardian kept his eyes onto Herod who cleared his throat and looked at him as if noticing him staring.
Herod spoke "King Owen's Queen was reportedly a female from Columbia who liked him personality wise. It was without realizing that he was the heir to the Mahalia throne. He attended some school in Columbia nation anonymously is where he met this female who was found by this deity in question. She was brought to Mahalia which she became his wife and his Queen."
He frowned to give Herod a head bob who added "Besides Victor something you should know is that your Father isn't King Owen's own offspring but someone else's son. Your Father was influenced by Owen himself to take over the King's titled duties after it became clear that he didn't have any offsprings to pass down the title."
He exhaled a breath hearing that as Herod added talking "Soon after Owen's wife was introduced to the public as his Queen is when someone from Brittany nation bribed a doctor to misdiagnose her sick. She was actually poisoned by this doctor in question who used the excuse of some cancer hitting her baby carrier. He claimed the cancer was terminal enough to have the baby carrier removed preventing any offspring carrying status. This doctor wound up caught in this bribery scheme when he tried to misdiagnose Owen him self's sickness as some cancer hitting his sensitive part. This doctor claimed the cancer was hitting the area that produces the seed for offspring to form in females through mating. The stunt of poisoning Owen came out in response. The poisoning in question was done by this doctor. He wound up later was under interrogation admitted the scheme of Brittany nation's ruler at the time having Owen and wife kept childless. Then later having Owen and his wife taken out via some assassination method for their ruler to take over the Mahalia nation."
He frowned forming it on his lips as Herod paused to clear his throat then continued talking "The heavy poisoning and antidote by the doctor left Owen's body too damaged for him to father offsprings through females. Your Father was found after a heavy search on who could take the King position title. Owen and his wife were not indicating on having offsprings publicity as expected. The excuse of a surrogate carrying Owen's son and raising him secretly was used to explain your Father publicity taking the King title and duties. This happened soon after Owen was presumed dead in some boating accident of sailing a boat. He was sailing with a crew that reportedly ran into a powerful spinner like storm. He and the boat and crew went missing on the way to Atalanta Ocean to compete in the Egyptian World Games. The boat in question hasn't been found along with the crew despite there a heavy search in the Atalanta Ocean's bottom depths. This was to figure out if the boat sank in the area where its distress signal was last heard. That's the official story related to Owen's disappearance actually. Your Majesty you want me to tell him the unofficial story?"
He eyed the Queen who gave a head bob in response. 
Guardian eyed Herod who resumed looking at him and spoke "Some vampire deity answering to the name of Hades wanted to live a life as an Egyptian in a ruler position. Hades got a hold of Owen through some deal arrangement switched places with him. Owen wound up becoming Hades himself and this deity becoming an Egyptian named Nikolas who took the Mahalia King position and ruled in Owen's stead.
Nikolas overheard inventing the saying 'Bloody Hades.' 
This fact became knowledge soon after it became obvious that Nikolas your Father was different from normal Egyptian standards when it comes to processing nourishment through his body. Nikolas was only living on a liquid diet including drinking blood. He admitted this deal to his staff members at the time. He ordered the staff positions be passed down via offspring to keep this secret deal fact out of public knowledge. The staff obeyed to doing that passing down. My current position of General wasn't passed down via offspring instead via promotions of people the General back then figured wouldn't talk on this deal. Hence I having the position at the moment due to that my promotion was recommended by a family member of that General. It was from me displaying a very strong loyalty attitude towards your Father himself. My loyalty attitude involved defending him from people insulting his appearance among the military members' groups. The reason for the insults related to your Father's appearance was that they thought he wasn't born of Mahalia. People in Mahalia hardly having a twin appearance as his and assumed that he was Columbian born. Columbians have twin appearance looks hence the insults spoken about him." 
Guardian frowned but gave Herod a head bob as the General paused from talking to clear his throat then continued speaking "I warn you that my promotion to this General position was recent. It was at the beginning of this cycle is when I was given this position. That was due to a recommendation from a family descendant of a former General who was aware of this deity deal. The family member figured I would be ideal candidate to take this position. I wound up with this position despite heavy campaigning by military members towards your Father on picking a candidate who they approved to take this position. The approved candidate was passed over by him and I picked in response. Several of the military's members in leadership positions have made no secret of disapproving of having me picked for this General position. They have hit your Father with verbal threats of assassinating him if he didn't remove me and put their approved candidate in my stead."
Guardian didn't comment a response as Herod looked at the Queen he still looking at the General "I suspect that the military members succeeded in assassinating His Majesty via bribing the pilot to crash the plane in a location. They could take him out but unfortunately this bribery deal backfired when it became obvious that the plane was destroyed in some fiery crash explosion. Its explosion taking out all aboard into some light extinguished status. That's my theory of why His Majesty was killed." 
He shifted to eye the Queen who frowned before speaking "Alright Herod, leave the theories of my husband's light extinguished in the room to yourself. Actually my husband was suffering some medical condition that was causing him very terrible pains. It turned out that he was mysteriously poisoned with nothing to indicate of curing him of that medical ailment. There were various antidotes used to prolong his life. I haven't figured out who poisoned him successfully enough for him to bow to people's demands. Its how he allowed people who trashed him to get away with the insults and demands for him to do various things. Such as allowing the states to run some lottery on who'll host him for the King's Day holiday. 
Nick has told me ‘I don’t like doing that!’ in my presence repeatedly over and over. 
I have told him repeatedly ‘You to use your King title influence to stop that lottery from happening.’ 
He has balked on doing that ordering for cycles. Nick and I got into a terrible argument about the subject is when he accidentally slipped out the poisoned status to me. I figured out that he was bowing to people's demands on getting things done due to his medical ailment." 
Guardian continued to eye the Queen who paused to appear to gulp before adding "My husband coming out with Nicky was an excuse to flaunt to the public that he could easily replace his male heir Victor with another. That's it if anything bad happened to Victor himself hence Nicky flaunted as the heir. It was just to take attention off Victor who's the actual declared heir according to Nick himself to me privately. The story of me being jealous of the female who bore Victor was an excuse. It was to take attention off Victor himself to have attention focus onto Nicky. My husband feared that Victor would be easily influenced to do something inappropriate with the King titled duties. One example is the Brittany natives getting a hold of Victor and convincing him to give Mahalia nation underneath their rule. He was reportedly was raised without his Father's influence in his life. Nick confessed to me that he kept tabs on Victor soon after a midwife contacted him on wanting to adopt his son. That's due to his Mother an actress reportedly fingered him as the Father of her baby. She apparently didn't want to raise him to be influenced in some bad way due to her profession as an actress. Offsprings of famous actresses have turned out to be heavily influenced by the public in a bad way whenever raised by people in the acting world.”
He eyed the Queen who shifted to look at him while speaking "Those offsprings in case you don't know, Victor, have turned out to be heavily influenced by too many press people putting pressure on them publicity to follow their parents into the acting industry. This has happened repeatedly over and over towards offsprings of famous actors and actresses living in Mahalia at the time. Your Mother must have feared that this would happen to you. She gave you up just to prevent pressure put on you publicity by the Mahalia native people and press to follow her into the acting industry. She wanted you to avoid being raised in the public eye. Your Mother from what I figured must have realized that having you in the public eye as flaunted as her son and son of the King would cause you to be pressured heavily from the natives of Mahalia. Mostly with terrible influences from the public and press people on how to live your life just prior to taking the King's throne title. Hence she giving you up and hiding herself as your Mother from the public and from yourself as well." 
He frowned forming it on his lips as the Queen paused to clear her throat then continued talking "The midwife who raised you was probably ordered by my husband not to flaunt you as his son but her own offspring instead. Someone in his circle was ordered to keep an eye onto you ready to give advice with your Father's influence once it was obvious that your Mother raiser couldn't raise you anymore. It explains why you had someone spying onto you all your life including secret meetings with this Warwick as he's called. Mostly to give you advice said from your Father to you on living your life hidden from the public. That was until your Father was unable to keep the King's throne title and duties is when you would take his place once it was obvious you could do that." 
He heard a throat clearing noise sounding loudly in the room he figured came from Herod as the Queen paused from talking. She he saw was appearing to look elsewhere. He figured was appearing to be at the General by her head position. 
He saw her resumed looking at him and speaking "Your coronation of being crowned King will happen before this day is over. It'll happen once security can assure of your safety to Crystal Cathedral a Patrician Church of Patricia's religious order. The crowning ceremony is always happening at the Patrician Church as traditionally done for males taking the King position. The ceremony will be publicity broadcasted live via King's personal press people assigned to cover the crowning each time it happens. This along with publicity introducing offspring declared the heir to the throne once their old enough to withstand the pressures of the press and public. This always happens once the heir is at the declared age of sixteen as traditionally done. My husband broke that tradition by introducing Nicky to the public. The introduction was as an excuse to put people off from assuming that you as his first born son would be declared the heir. That was to avoid the press from pressuring him to publicity introduce you. He was having some secret poisoned status hitting him quite lengthy. The poisoned status caused him havoc with him running things as King. Hence he was doing what he could to outwit the people poisoning him. It was suspected that the Brittany nation's ruler had people responsible for the poisoned status. That's from demands aimed at him by the people who poisoned him via middle man communications. They were indicating on supporting Brittany nation's takeover attempts. Hence he doing what he could to outwit them and keep you safe enough to take his place. Once he was sure he could give up the King title medically and you avoided being a victim of a poisoning." 
He again heard Herod give off a loud throat clearing noise sighed softly as the Queen added "Victor, please go wait in your assigned bedroom till everything has been arranged for your coronation. It's going to take forever for that to happen. Security is very paranoid on Brittany nation having assassins put in place to take your light extinguished, after word got out that my husband's light was extinguished. I warn you that Mahalia's spies in Brittany nation have sent communications to here repeatedly. They have indicated that Brittany's current ruler a male holding the King position has displayed some do anything attitude to do what it takes to get Mahalia nation underneath the Brittany nation's rule. I'm pretty sure that Brittany's ruler like his predecessors has already have spies in Mahalia to report on what's going on. The news of my husband's light extinguished would be broadcasted to Brittany via spies doing it. They will be broadcasting propaganda aimed at Mahalia to indicate that they have taken over. They have repeatedly been doing each time a King has been declared light extinguished. That propaganda hitting I warn you will backfire. The public questioned very strongly via anonymous sources have indicated that they don't want to be underneath Brittany nation's rule. They prefer to be ruling independently with their own ruler period. The answers to questions have indicated that their undecided on who should take the throne Nicky or you. This happened while your Father's light was active. I suspect that the debate will be settled by them choosing you to take the throne. I have to make arrangements of getting clearance from security of having someone assigned to travel with you. Your going to your coronation even if it's me or Olga escorting you whoever security feels would be a safety issue. Excuse me so leave now Victor to your room." 
Guardian didn't say a word left the room hearing Herod speaking from behind "Excuse me Your Majesty while I see Victor to his room. That includes instructing him on safety protocols while out traveling to the coronation."
Guardian sensed Herod following him out as he walked to his assigned room. He went inside still followed by the General who shut the door. Herod walked up to him he feeling himself compelled to remain still. Herod held up a syringe needle he saw and injected it into his neck and pumped the contents into it making him dizzy. He felt a feeling like wanting to throw up hit. Once Herod removed the needle he darted into the bathroom and was lengthy with the expelling. He felt the expelling ended walked out to find his familiar butler there with a cart. 
Herod he saw was still there speaking "It takes two opponents to play a game my Queen." 
He stiffened from Herod's words as Herod gestured towards the butler "Give him some nourishment now. He needs it." 
Guardian didn't comment a response went to sit at the table's chair. He got a tray smelling of nourishment holding various foods in dishware and drinks on it making his stomach rumble. He found the butler forcing him to take his time eating and drinking the food. By the butler's hands' manipulating his hands holding the silverware and cups repeatedly till everything was consumed. 
Guardian spoke once the butler removed the tray "What's going on with your wording Herod?"
He frown eyeing Herod who cleared his throat as the butler he noticed took the tray and cart out of the room in a fast move while shutting the door. He heard the door's lock click in place. 
Guardian continued to frown as Herod spoke "I was specifically put in this General position to assure of your safety. Mostly from the Queen and her machinations of wanting you to rule things her way like she pulled onto your Father having him poisoned. Mostly poisoned enough to be her puppet doing things what she wanted. This poisoned status she pulled onto your Father making it appear that Brittany nation natives were behind it. This didn't fool the King not one bit who easily figured out that she was responsible for the poisoning. Your Father wasn't fooled by middle man communications with the ones who claimed to poison him were echoing the Queen's demanding words word to word. He recalled have private arguments with her demanding him to do things he balked on doing. Your Father wound up forced to do them after it became obvious that she got him into some poisoned status. The poisoned status happened a cycle after word came out that he fathered you." 
Guardian frown eyeing as Herod added "It was the Queen who insisted to him balking on declaring you his heir. She was very strongly refusing to let him publicity show you. That was strong jealousy aimed at the female who bore you. The Queen has put out an assassination order I managed to cancel without her knowing of it, towards the female who bore you. Besides I warn you that spies of Brittany's ruler is aware of the Queen pulling things around here including controlling your Father. The ruler has managed to thwart her attempts to get Mahalia underneath her control by how power mad she is. Brittany's ruler's spies have managed to communicate of them stopping her attempts to get things done her way. This includes via controlling your Father to do those things. Some of those things involve giving her Queen's position more power to control Mahalia while lessoning the ruler ship of the King's titled position. The spies tell me they have managed to put a stop to it." 
Guardian didn't comment a response as Herod cleared his throat then continued speaking "I warn you that Brittany's ruler has through a contact delivering the message to me privately that there's spies working in the King's circle including among the staff members working here to report on what's going on. Brittany's ruler at the moment has seemed undecided on whether to pursue which action to do. It involves taking over Mahalia nation underneath his rule or doing something about the machinations of the Queen being power mad. His contact did warn me that he has people currently hidden checking out the Queen's background. The spies at the moment are checking out her story of being from Republic state due to her sounding of being from there. Republic state is a popular refuge for natives living in the Republics of the Tsar to live. Out of safety of being persecuted of crimes the Tsar and government officials have brought up against them. This including living out of safety of others in that nation targeting them for assassinations."
He sighed softly as Herod pause hearing a familiar knocking on the door sound. He eyed the General who went to the door yanking it open to show a male wearing an army combat uniform. The male came walking into the room carrying a silver suitcase. Guardian frowned eyeing the male who spoke "I have the proper gear for Victor to wear for safety issues while out among the public." 
Guardian stood up and eyed the male who put the suitcase onto the bed. He watched as the male yanked open the suitcase. He saw a vest looking like it was armored inside the suitcase from its black color. 
He heard from Herod "It's an armored protection vest to be worn underneath your upper body's clothes whenever out traveling among the public period."
Guardian sighed and went to the bed yanking off his jacket putting it on the bed. Guardian took off his buttoned top of another color revealing his muscular chest and muscular arms. His arms wound up bare with the scar on his left arm to be seen. Guardian saw Herod and the suitcase holding male's eyes both widen seeing his form along with focused onto his scarred left arm. He gave them both a glare and cleared his throat loudly. The suitcase holder's male servant he saw shook his head of staring before going to the vest. He was handed the vest finding the male assisting on how to put it on properly. Guardian found the armored vest covered his upper body from his shoulders to his waist leaving his arms bare. The vest felt stiffly hard on his form as he went to his long sleeve shirt and put it on. Guardian wound up getting Herod assisting on making the shirt look neat on his form along with doing the straightening with his jacket. Guardian kept his mouth shut as the suitcase holding male left the room. 
He eyed Herod who spoke "Just get some sleep while you're at it. You don't know when security will clear you to travel for the coronation. This can happen at early hours of the morning while its still nightfall. This was just to avoid fighting with traffic on the way and assassination attempts. Security pulled this stunt I heard onto Owen soon after he arrived to Mahalia. The coronation happened after news of his Father passing away reached him in Columbia. He was crowned in an early hour of the morning after he arrived to Mahalia via plane. Security wound up suspecting that his Father was poisoned to death by spies of the Brittany nation's ruler back then. They broadcasted some propaganda message throughout Mahalia about them fully taking over the nation. The broadcast happened an hour after Owen's Father was found with light extinguished from his poisoned status proving them responsible for this stunt."
He didn't comment a response went to the bed and leaned his form against the headboard shutting his eyes passing out unconscious. 

Guardian came to feeling a hand shaking his shoulder he forcing open his eyes. Guardian frowned finding Olga in the room with him as the hand's owner. He saw the lamp was on from sitting on the dresser on along with noticing Herod in vicinity. He spotted four armed in armor like clothes he assumed were part of the army. The males he saw having various knife like weapons attached to their armor on their forms. He sighed and didn't comment a response got up and wordlessly followed Herod taking the lead with Olga next to him. The armored males spotted by him looking taking the rear out of the house to a van with black tinted windows. He noticed other too many to count in the driveway multiple twin vans in vicinity. He got inside a van with Herod and Olga escorting him. Guardian buckled up his seatbelt and eyed the window showing the house as the lights surrounding the area went out plunging darkness. He sighed and looked down at his hands blindly sitting on his lap. The van was felt moving which Guardian looked up blindly to peer at what he assumed was the driver's side finding that the blackness remained. He figured that the driver was using some seeing in the night vision ability to drive the vehicle through the blackness. Guardian continued to see the blackness remained intact instead of showing Capital city lighted up. 
He figured "The city's electrical grid was shut off just to prevent people from interfering with the motorcade transporting me to the cathedral for the crowning ceremony." 
Guardian resumed staring at his hands blindly again. He kept his head down listening to the noises around him consisted of multiple people breathing. Some seemingly nervous to him by the rapid fired breathing noises. Guardian heard various breathing patterns till the vehicle stopped abruptly followed by doors to the van yanked open by the noises. He found Olga taking his arm as he took off his seat belt blindly. He discovered her expertly guiding him out of the van like she had night vision. Along with up several sets of stairs into the cathedral he assumed was where he was going is when there was door slamming shut heard that echoed loudly. 
This was followed a voice heard blaring "Turn on the lights now!" 
Guardian blinked his eyes from the lights' glare to find himself in a church from the looks of it. He glimpsed after a quick look of looking quite grand from its tall towering height above. Guardian spotted the church having multiple pews in front of him. He noticed various press people having cameras aimed at him. Guardian noticed a uniformed male wearing a brown robe with a golden rope belt on his waist standing in the middle of the pews' section in an aisle with a crown seated on a stand next to him. Guardian spotted a footstool he assumed was for kneeling in front of the male. Guardian didn't comment a response as Olga let go of his arm and gently pushed him forwards. He walked towards the Man of Cloth he assumed was the robed male as the press people kept their camera devices aimed at him while one was flashing lights from one of their cameras. He ignored the lights' show to reach the Man of Cloth and felt compelled to kneel on the footstool. He obeyed to the compulsion. 
Guardian got the Man of Cloth speaking while picking up the crown from the stand and going to stand in front of him "I now crown you King of Mahalia! Your name shall be Yevgeny Alexander Visser! Rule us well!" 
He felt the crown onto his head settle on it like it easily fit. This was followed by the Man of Cloth backing up two steps and stopping to bow towards him. He felt the crown still sticking to his head by something in it clinging to his hair. Guardian turned around standing up with back to the Man of Cloth as if compelled.
He figured "Bloody Hades, Meritanians you have to manipulate me?"
He wound up cutting his thought to find the press's cameras were gathered in a semicircle facing in a direction towards him. 
Guardian thought as a memory flashed into his mind "My Mother raiser told me of my Father's coronation. She told me of what Mahalia's Kings were traditionally required to do once crowned king while facing the press's cameras." 
He cut his thought to focus onto a camera while raising a hand fisting it up his eye level and then brought the fist to over the left side on his chest. 
"It was as traditionally done to symbolize the King's oath towards Mahalia natives" He thought. 
Guardian spoke firmly while eyeing one of the cameras "I am King Yevgeny Alexander Visser ruler of all of Mahalia and her island territories underneath my control as long as live as her ruler! I rule you well!" 
He removed his hand fisted to wave it in front of him fist eye level with his eyes. Guardian lowered his arm uncurling the fist seeing the press's people stop their recording. The presses seen appearing to stop their attention aimed at him by fiddling with the buttons on their devices. 
He went to the Man of Cloth who spoke "The crown stays in the cathedral in a safe spot hidden from you. Its location is only known to the Patrician order is when it'll come out for the crowning of your successor. That crown is the crown used to crown Mahalia's first King. His actual name wasn't Yevgeny Alexander Visser but that name wound up adopted at his crowning by a Patrician member giving him that name he accepted. It was just to hide his family's origins leading the rebellion that threw out the Brittany natives' and their monarchy ruler. All I can say regarding Yevgeny the first is that he was a Brittany native who arrived to Mahalia just to better his life for his wife and twin off springs. Mahalia his Queen as the nation is named bore him twins, a male dubbed Ivan and a female dubbed Georgina. Ivan wound up taking the crown and the name of Alexander instead of his actual name. Hence I give you the second name of Alexander to make you unique from Yevgeny the first. The Republics' of the Tsar was having a fighting revolution at the time. His actual name of Ivan was a Republic name so hand me that crown now." 
Guardian obeyed feeling his hair being pulled partially from the crown as he yanked it off his head. He wound up seeing the Man of Cloth snatched the crown from him despite part of his hair attached that got pulled out. Guardian saw the Man of Cloth walk off out of sight through a doorway. He turned to face the press finding Olga in sight nearby that gave him a smirk.
She he stared at spoke "Come on let's get back to the residence and see about getting some sleep now. It's going to take forever before the local news's broadcasts to regularly come on TV. They'll be broadcasting their news. There'll be a rebroadcast of your crowning once the local news start airing. I hear the airing time for local news is at the time of six o'clock in the morning and not earlier." 
He didn't comment a response followed Olga to the vehicle finding the lights again turned off. Guardian again found Olga guiding him expertly into the van and buckling up his seatbelt for him. He eyed his hands blindly as the van was felt starting up and driving through the darkness seemingly not lengthy till it stopped. 
He was told “I ordered you out!” by Herod.
Guardian obeyed finding Olga guiding him out and into the house residence. He wound up finding the hallway lights blaring as usual. 
Guardian eyed his sister who spoke "Yevgeny, just go to your room and get some sleep now. Its going to be awhile before you'll have a good night's sleep. You're crowning as king requires you to travel around Mahalia and allied island nations while avoiding the plane transportation method. That's what got my Father's light extinguished via a plane crash. It's just to show support to people hurt by that disaster in their grief of losing him. So hit your bedroom now."
He obeyed finding the bedroom with no difficulty and stripped himself of his armored vest, clothes and shoes putting them in the closet. He then went into the bathroom to remove his hair band finding the hairbrush on the sink counter. Guardian once done brushing his hair went out to the bed clad in nothing. He went to yank back the blankets and got on the bed putting the blankets up to his chest. 
Guardian thought to himself as he felt his mind scanned by the Meritanians "Is this my life's purpose going to be? I as a puppet King underneath my Father's wife the Queen herself? What about acquiring someone for me to do my Guardian of Life and Death duties including my King titled duty?"
He frowned as he heard nothing in answer to his questions felt sleepiness in response sighed and shut his eyes to pass out unconscious. 

Guardian came to hearing the alarm clock blaring its ringing noise. He woke up with a start to find the lamp on and the butler in his bedroom.
The butler spoke while giving him a glare "Its morning its time for you to get up. With due respects go take a shower now."
Guardian obeyed to hear Tsk noise from the butler as he reached the bathroom door.
He looked at the butler who added "Clothes are a necessity when sleeping in bed sir."
He looked down at himself and found himself bare of clothes. Guardian with a soft groan went into the bathroom to shower. 
He mentally yelled "Yerra!'
He heard from Yerra "I managed to scan the Queen's mind. She appeared to detected the mind scanning via acting like she got head pain from it. Anyway from mind scans of her, her name is Svetlana no joke. She wasn't joking on being raised in Republic state. She was raised by a single parent a male. Her parent sort of spoiled her too much that she's managed to control her Father. She's managed to control him to the point of having her said to be a relative of the current Tsar. It's just to gain the hand of your Father in marriage. Your Father only pursued her via her reputation of being a relative of the current Tsar as rumored."
He took the shower washing he thoroughly as Yerra added "The Queen hasn't learned that being a spoiled brat isn't going to get her anything. She was detected thinking that view of her getting whatever she wants and doing what it takes to get things her way period. Also she didn't like being an object for your Father to display to the public. He went around running the nation as its leader and flaunted her as a trophy wife. Hence she coming up with the thinking that she should have say on running Mahalia. I can't say if she'll lose that thinking or not. Whenever she holds Nicky as she calls him she thinks of doing whatever the offspring demands. She has habitually obeyed to Nicky's demands over doing anything else."
Guardian heard nothing else from Yerra to quit his showering. Guardian went to dry his hair fully by the hair dryer including dried himself by towel. He wrapped a towel around his waist covering his sensitive parts like a skirt. He left the bathroom to find food on a tray in dishware on a table making him wary of taking it in. He sat and took his time eating and drinking the nourishment. He found his senses didn't blare this time when he drank the orange juice making him confused to that. Guardian found the butler had laid clothes and armored vest onto the bed. He found the bed already put in order despite clothes lying on it. He got himself dressed into the armored vest and clothes. Guardian frowned finding the butler watching him with narrowed eyes. The butler he saw was indicating by the eyes narrowed that he should figure out how to put the clothes and items on by himself. Guardian proceeded to do then go into the bathroom. Guardian recalled the butler's teaching on his hair brushed it and put it back in the acceptable tail style held by a hair band. He eyed the butler who looked him up and down before giving off a sign of approval by hand gesture.
The butler spoke "Show me the way to the Main office now. I need to know if you remember where it is."
He sighed and without a comment left the bathroom and the bedroom followed by the butler. He found the route to the Main office easily. Guardian took the route to find the butler once at arrival to the office's door knocked on it while he stood waiting. He found one of the Queen's guards opening the door that let him inside. He walked in to find the Queen seated at the desk's chair with a sneer on her face making him feel annoyed. He walked up to the desk and stood eyeing her warily. He heard gibberish spoken in a compelling voice tone behind him along with getting a headache hitting him. Guardian wound up finding himself remaining silent and refusing to talk as the head pain persisted. He recognized the head pain was his mind's way of balking Compeller's talk aimed at him to do anything which didn't matter if it involved talk. Guardian eyed the Queen who formed a glare in response to the gibberish spoken. 
He heard from the Queen who spoke interrupting the Compeller's speaking gibberish "Enough of that now. It's not working onto him anyway."
He kept his mouth shut as the Compeller's voice behind him quit the gibberish in a compelling voice tone. He felt the headache stopping as he heard door knocking sounds.
He frowned as he heard the Queen snarling "Answer the door now!"
Guardian turned sideways to eye the door to find Herod coming into the room who went to his familiar spot next to the desk.
Herod he eyed spoke "Something I can do for you Your Majesty?"
Guardian shifted to look at the Queen who jabbed a finger aimed at Herod. He stiffened hearing the familiar voice speaking gibberish in a compelling voice tone. He saw the voice's speaker was one of the short blonde haired guards behind Herod. Guardian stiffened further to see Herod flare golden eyes. He heard Herod spoke in familiar gibberish in a compelling voice tone. He eyed the bodyguard walking away as Herod cut his talking to glare appearing to be at the Queen with accusation in his eyes. 
Guardian looked at the Queen in response who spoke "Interesting that files on you don't say what you are Herod, a Compeller. It explains how you got this position despite heavy resistance done to your promotion. You compelled people to give you the General title didn't you hmm?'
Guardian kept his eyes onto the Queen finding her voice tone was in a sneer while seeing it on her face. 
He heard in response "With due respects my Queen does it matter on how I got the General position? That despite I what you accuse me of being a Compeller?"
He frowned inwardly as the Queen spoke "You being a Compeller do matter to me. I won't have people sabotaging my plans for Mahalia to lead as her ruler period. I insist on having that goal happen period. I won't tolerate anyone sabotaging me and my efforts."
Guardian exhaled a breath hearing that from the Queen. 
He heard from Herod abruptly "Who wants to live forever anyway?"
He heard the edge in Herod's voice tone. 
The Queen he kept his attention on spoke sneer gone from her face with anger in its place "I've lived too long not to have my plans thwarted by some Compeller. You sabotage me Herod. I will see you permanently deposed on a permanent basis. I'm not joking on my threat Herod. I have people willingly serving me who'll do what I say period."
Guardian eyed the Queen warily who shifted to look at him. 
He saw the angry look on her face change back to its sneer as she spoke "I have plans for you, Victor. I expect you to obey my plans period. You'll find yourself alone within your rebellion if you try to rebel against me and my plans towards you."
Guardian kept his mouth shut in response to give a head bob as the Queen added "Has the public received the broadcast of Victor's crowning?"
He frowned still hearing the sneering voice tone to hear from Herod "They have received the broadcast quite recently. The public is overheard currently spreading the word of Victor as you call him crowning as King at the moment. I'm still awaiting word of what the public's reaction towards Victor being their King."
Guardian kept his eyes onto the Queen who still sneer "Interesting. Anyway the Egyptian World Games of Egyptia is coming up. I already entered Victor into the sailing team. He should go meet the team as soon as possible for training including sailing to where the games are being hosted in Columbia."
He stiffened from the Queen's voice having an edge in her voice tone. 
Herod was heard "You sure this is necessary for Victor to do instead of being flaunted as King? Mostly around Mahalia helping the public with their grief on losing his predecessor?"
He saw the Queen form a glare and spoke "What I say as I order is my word of law period. I insist on this to happen immediately starting today. So see about getting Victor to the docks now."
He again heard the edge in the Queen's voice tone. 
Guardian frowned inwardly making him think "She's up to something nasty." 
He heard ahem noise to find the butler in the room that spoke "Come with me now sir."
Guardian obeyed to follow the butler out of the room. He found the butler leading him out of the house. He frowned as the butler led him to a landing pad in the yard holding a helicopter that didn't sound right to him. He wound up noticing that there was only the pilot aboard who didn't look happy to him. 
Guardian stiffened as he heard "I insist that you get aboard." 
He obeyed hearing the butler's wording had an edge in his voice he finding none of the bodyguards joining him inside. He stiffened to find the pilot piloting the helicopter above into the air. He finding the windows blacked out with some kind of paint despite attempts to scrub it. Guardian found the seatbelt locked around him as he tried to free himself. He found the helicopter came to a hover position after a lengthy time period of flying it. Guardian peered out the pilot's window to spot a deserted street as his senses blared warning unexpectedly. He saw the pilot slumping over as if dead. He found the helicopter exploding in fire all around him.

Part Four: Recovery

Guardian felt himself unaffected by the fire as it burned off his clothes and made the armored vest too hot on his form along with burning off the seatbelt that was made out of cloth. Guardian yanked off the armored vest from the heat. He found the helicopter felt hitting the ground and setting off another fireball giving off fire finding he still not burning to death. He felt annoyance take hold walked out of the wreckage lying on the ground he saw was on a road. Guardian finding he bare of clothes and shoes finding his hair was free of the hair band. The wind he felt was whipping his hair all over the place. He walked out of the fire's inferno towards a crowd gathered on the street that looked several of emotions seeing him in view. Guardian once reaching the crowd formed a glare on his face spoke ahem comment loudly. He found various males going up to him to give him some clothes for coverage. He finding that they were men's jackets. He didn't protest as the people wrapped his waist covering his sensitive parts. He kept the glare on his face as one of the males put a jacket on his form to wear. He got gestured by a male wearing an apron to come with him. He obeyed following to find the male leading him into a restaurant from the looks of it. He sat at a lonely table in the dining room cleared of patrons. Guardian got nourishment placed in front of him on the table. He ate the food and drank the drink while feeling his body and his skin didn't indicate of anything of being burned to him. Guardian ate the food and drank the nourishment taking his time still keeping the glare on his face. He saw Herod come into view doing a double take look seeing him once in the restaurant before going up to him and kneeling on one knee.
Herod, he heard speaking loudly "Your Majesty, my King, I await your commands."
He ignored Herod to continue eating and drinking as if compelled by the Meritanians he sensed were helping him heal, before finished with the nourishments.
Guardian got up to speak sounding firm "Take me where I can get properly attired now Herod."
Guardian kept the glare as Herod got up speaking "Follow me, Your Majesty." 
He obeyed finding the city's people getting out of the way while noticing them looking nervous. He followed Herod to a male's suit shop he saw had clothes in it. 
He saw one of the Queen's bodyguards there who spoke seeing him "Your Majesty the proper clothing is in the dressing room."
Guardian didn't say a word in response went into the dressing room's area to find the Queen there who had an angry look on her face. 
The Queen snarled he heard "Bloody Hades, who are you some deity? That helicopter explosion should have killed you like I ordered it to happen."
Guardian felt the Meritanians manipulating him to activate the guardian power activating within him abruptly he thought "Oh that's how it actives with the Meritanians manipulating me." 
He found himself cutting off his thought while speaking in his familiar creepy Daisuke's twin voice "I am the Guardian of life and death. You cannot extinguish my light for only Egyptia can do this. I live forever for as long as Egyptia has use for me."
Guardian glared at the Queen who took a step back forming a fear look on her face. 
He stiffened with a start as his guardian powers stopped being activated to think "She's one of the deathless humanoids living in Egyptia. I figured that she's deathless judging by reaction was twin to the reaction Daisuke displayed when I revealed my Guardian of Egyptia's identity." 
Guardian spoke firmly as the Queen appeared to be more nervous "Now about those clothes. I want to be properly attired. For what I'm wearing isn't proper at the moment. Why are you acting afraid of me anyway?"
He formed a confused look onto his face while eyeing the Queen. She, he saw appeared to compose herself before looking calm.
Guardian heard from her "You'll find the proper attire in this dressing room."
He saw her point a finger aimed at a dressing room's door obeyed. Guardian kept giving her a confused look while staring at the Queen with confusion as he went into the dressing room. He shut the door locked it and exhaled a breath to rub a hand on his forehead. Guardian took a look around and found his Victor identity clothes inside including the armored vest. He put on the clothes finding that they all felt more richly made than cheapo feeling. He frowned as he couldn't find a hair brush for his hair. Guardian checked himself in the mirror finding his hair was intact and not burned off from explosion. He walked out finding the Queen still there that appeared to gulp seeing him. Guardian saw the Queen still looking nervous as he kept the confused expression on his face while eyeing her. 
Guardian spoke using confusion in his voice tone "That helicopter crash? I don't remember getting out and losing my clothes in the process. Someone explain it to me." 
He groaned softly on having to lie towards the Queen. His lie was due to hiding his knowledge of his Guardian status from humanoids as ordered by Egyptia via Meritanians manipulating him to do it. 
He frowned as the Queen did a double take look towards him before her speaking "Just don't worry about the helicopter crash anyway. Excuse me. You and I are wanted outside to meet the public actually."
Guardian wordlessly followed to hear within his mind "Managed to scan the Queen's mind on which Egyptian species she is. Turns out she's one of those hidden humanoids who are immune to Compellers' voice tones. Those humanoids are marked by their eyes displayed a different color from normal Egyptians' eye color. She's wearing an eye disguise at the moment to hide that status. I got to add that those humanoids call themselves Immunes due to Compeller's immunity. They aren't really deathless but very long lived actually. The Immunes have been caught thinking their deathless repeatedly which their not. They can be killed by any of the medical ailments hitting Egyptians including via other Egyptians doing the assassinating. This can kill the Queen in question." 
He heard nothing more from Yerra as he followed the Queen outside the males' shop to stand next to her. He found a semi circle gathering of presses flashing their lights from devices aimed at the both of them. Guardian found the Queen going up to a microphone stand appearing to speak. He frowned as she shook her head and then hand gestured towards him to speak. 
He obeyed to think "I know what to say while standing in front of the microphones."
Guardian spoke after a pause of light shows from the presses "I'm the son of his majesty King Nikolas Visser himself born through another female and not by his wife the Queen herself."
He clamped his mouth shut to form a thin line as the presses' lights became more glaring. Guardian heard various questions thrown at him by different press members. 
He heard one presses' comment loudly "I want to focus was on asking you on your life of being raised by a midwife so ignore the questions." 
Guardian spoke as honestly "I was raised by a midwife till her light extinguished in a car accident."
He finding himself refusing to say how or what she died in a car accident despite asked. Guardian clamped his mouth shut refusing to talk more on the subject aimed at him about his life after his Mother raiser's death towards the presses despite pestered to do it. He kept his mouth shut as the presses continued asking him various questions that were all over the place. 
Guardian felt himself annoyed to find Herod at his side who whispered in his ear "Its time to go now Your Majesty."
He obeyed to follow Herod through the crowd of presses held back by cops in an aisle sensing the Queen following from behind. Guardian followed Herod to a limo which he and escorts got inside. He felt the limo start up followed by the driver driving it through the streets. He noticed a police escort that boxed the limo with lights from their vehicles flashing. He frowned as he heard gibberish spoken from the Queen unexpectedly she sounding angry. Guardian eyed Herod in response to see suspicion form in Herod's eyes. He saw the suspicion leave Herod followed by a familiar facial look indicating that the General figured something out. He heard the Queen kept up her angry language speaking still sounding furious to him. Guardian looked out the window ignoring the Queen ranting her gibberish language seemingly lengthy. The limo he was in reached the house to stop in the driveway near the residence. He got ordered out by Herod which he obeyed. Guardian walked inside the house still hearing the Queen still blaring her angry untranslatable words. He sensed the Queen was following them into the residence till they reached the Main office. He found the Queen once inside the Main office quit her ranting after thrust Nicky by a maid. Guardian eyed the Queen in response who appeared to compose herself before shifting her attention towards Nicky. He saw the Queen giving Nicky a look of Mother's love he recognized from attending multiple births of offsprings. 
He recalled "I saw that look from the Mothers seeing their babies by giving their baby the twin facial appearance whenever they held their offspring for the first time." 
He frown hearing Nicky giving off loud wailing noises. Guardian looked away as he went to sit down in the desk's chair. He eyed the staff members in the room with a glare noticing them each looking nervous. 
Guardian noticed the nervousness whenever he eyed each staff member before speaking "Report on that helicopter crash now."
He formed a glare as Herod spoke "The crash's results are still being tested at the moment. The testing is on the computer monitor that was monitoring the helicopter in use. The computer's system was found working fine despite the helicopter's destruction. Witness report seeing you walking out of the inferno clad in nothing on your form while displaying this all white eyed look. Your skin and hair by the looks of you seen are both looking like it wasn't affected by the fire actually. Once you reached the witnesses is when you quit that odd look and indicated on demanding some clothing on your form. The clothing status was indicated that your mind wasn't affected by the crash in question. You displayed a very heavy appetite when taking in the nourishment they gave you. The nourishment they gave you was a five course meal set for three people. You were seen eating and drinking everything set down in front of you on the table. I also being in your presence noticed this heavy appetite as well. So talk on what you remember of the crash now, Your Majesty."
He spoke as firmly as he could "I recall the pilot slumping over then nothing else after that. I came to found myself standing naked bare of clothes facing people with ranges of emotions on their faces seeing me. It's when I gave them a signal my way of demanding for clothes. Herod care to explain how you got to the restaurant so fast soon after the explosion? I wasn't in there long enough by the breaks between nourishment cooked for me to take in. You were looking like you weren't surprised by the disaster but seemed shocked to see me alive. So talk on that now."
Guardian glared at Herod hating himself on having to lie on hiding his Guardian of Egyptia's status from people. 
“You have to hide that status.” as enforced by the Meritanians “We’re insisting on that to happen period.” 
"My hiding status was from recalling the Meritanians ordering me once I found out my purpose on Egyptia after my Mother raiser's death by my hand in a car accident." Guardian mentally thought to himself. 
Herod he glared at appeared to gulp before looking at the Queen with a glare in response. 
He eyed the Queen to find the female speaking once he glared at her with an angry look "Alright that helicopter crash was an excuse to take you out Victor. I had plans that involved me ruling Mahalia as their monarchy ruler alone in title. It appears that is not my purpose at the moment other than raising Nicky." 
Guardian spoke recalling Olivia "Check Beach City in West Allied state where a Samira female named Olivia Madison lives. She's currently last I heard married to this Daisuke Yamato. She's currently still living with Daisuke while raising a boy child named Ian to my knowledge. Warwick on contact said that this Olivia after I met her was my sister, your daughter actually."
Guardian heard a gasp from the Queen followed by tears spilling from her eyes. 
He continued talking "I'm not even sure if Olivia is still living where she's currently at, at the moment or elsewhere. The location of her residence when I lived with her is on Dorrance Street in Beach City. It's a house used to house people helping them get back onto their feet after they suffer some disaster of losing everything in their life. That's what I was told via Olivia's Mother raiser herself. Olivia's Mother raiser called herself Rita wound up later having her light extinguished from some medical ailment of cancer actually. Olivia is currently raising Olga's son at the moment she dubs by the name of Ian after her Father raiser. Also I believe that Nicky is Olivia's son born through her actually."
He clamped his mouth shut to see the Queen kiss Nicky on the forehead before walking out of the room without another word followed by two of the bodyguards. Guardian frowned as he heard from Herod "You confirmed what the Queen and her husband were overheard arguing about. The argument was prior to the King taking his ill fated plane trip to Republic state."
He got up and spoke "See me to my room Herod now." 
Guardian felt himself annoyed with his wordings. He found Herod leading him out of the office to his familiar teenage male bedroom to his annoyance. 
Inside the room he got from Herod speaking after giving off a loud beep noise "Spill it Victor on what I've seen from you talking to the Queen on being this Guardian of life and death. Don't deny it. I have the ability to see everything all over within my mind so talk on this now."
He folded his arms to glare at Herod as he heard in response "Tsk Mason must you pester Egyptia's hand towards deathless manoids?"
He frowned hearing Tut's words including the name of Mason to hear from Herod again using his voice "So explain this Guardian of life and death bit I got from Victor towards the Queen as seen in my mind, Tut."
Guardian exhaled a breath hearing the Meritanian's name spoken by Herod he assumed was actually named Mason. 
Guardian frowned visibly to hear from Tut "The Guardian of life and death was Egyptia's creation towards deathless humanoids causing damage within her. Egyptia kept finding no success of removing those humanoids in question on a permanent basis. She created Victor to do that job for her. He already had success in removing some annoying deathless humanoids she orders him to kill. Victor is already aware of this status actually."
Guardian eyed Herod who shifted to look at him with eyes narrowed.
He frowned as Herod spoke "This bit of Guardian being the King isn't going to work out very well. It's how closely spied the public will be onto him like they were onto his Father in question."
He frowned forming it onto his lips as he heard in response "Leave that to Yerra and me to handle that matter in question, Mason. We have already had success on handling the spying public spying onto Victor after his Mother raiser passed away in a car accident so don't worry about it."
Guardian kept his eyes onto Herod as he sensed the Meritanian became silent and cutting off the scanning. 
He heard from Herod "That helicopter crash? Were you aware of what happened actually?"
He gave a head bob in response keeping his mouth shut Herod was seen touched his arm giving off a familiar beep sound. 
He frowned as Herod spoke "Alright you told me what you know of the helicopter crash. So get some rest while you're in here. I suspect that you'll need the sleep anyway."
He found himself agreeing with Herod's talk that without a word left the room. Guardian went into the bathroom to strip himself of his clothes, armored vest and shoes. He got himself into the shower and scrubbed himself thoroughly as he could. He cleaned himself with soap and shampoo then once done dried himself fully. Guardian wrapped the towel around his waist and picked up everything he left on the floor to carry into the bedroom. He found Herod back into his bedroom with the butler to his annoyance. 
Guardian formed a glare as Herod spoke "The butler's duty other than being a butler is being your personal physician. He's here to check you out from the helicopter crash. He's to make sure your fine physically with no side problems from the crash despite seen indicating no injury to the form."
He dumped the items in his hands onto a dresser. Guardian stood with arms folded as the butler placed a black briefcase onto the bed opening it. He saw a computer like monitor screen inside. He eyed the butler who picked up a hand sized wand from the suitcase. 
He heard from the butler who spoke firmly "Hold out your arms now while I wave the scanner over you."
Guardian obeyed to find the butler was slow with the wand waving and did it all over the place on him. He finding the wand waving was including not sparing his sensitive parts after removing his towel. Guardian finding Herod having widen eyes seeing his form he glared at the General who shook his head and formed a frown in response to his glare. 
He kept his arms out till the butler spoke "Done with the scanning. The Eli will tell me within moments on what I need to know regarding your health Your Majesty."
He picked up the towel and wrapped it around his waist to resume folding his arms. Guardian eyed the butler who put the wand back into the briefcase and typed some buttons on the keyboard included inside. He glared as he heard a beep sound sounding loudly in a fast tone seemingly lengthy making him annoyed with the noises till it cut itself off. The computer monitor screen flashed colors he glimpsed he unable to see clearly what image it was showing. 
Guardian kept his arms folded as the butler spoke "Eli says that Victor is in perfect health at the moment. Some bed rest is what I recommended for him to do for the remainder of the day and night. It's till morning the next day is when he can resume his activities."
He shifted to glare at Herod who spoke "What your doctor orders you obey period. It's his duty on keeping you alive at all costs. You to rule Mahalia till an heir possibly Nicky is old enough to takeover the King's title."
Guardian spoke firmly "Pajamas where can I find them around here? A servant no, no me sleeping without clothes on."
He eyed Herod to hear in response "Excuse me."
Guardian shifted to eye the butler who had the briefcase closed to go to a dresser drawer opening it. He frowned as the butler pulled out a piece of clothing he saw were some kind of loose sweats in black from the looks of them. 
Guardian got tossed the pants by the butler towards him he caught to hear "Your Father kept the habit of wearing these kinds of pants as his pajamas when sleeping in bed and nothing else on his form. I figured that they'll do for you as your pajamas. It was the Queen who insisted towards your Father, she overheard in the morning to have some kind of pants to be worn for bed. This insisting was after I wound up waking them both up for breakfast. She wanted your Father to avoid the naked status in bed. She didn't seem to appreciate the naked status seen from your Father. He was appearing to be parading his nakedness in front of female servants ordered to wake them up for breakfast in the morning. The female servants according to the Queen were acting amused seeing your Father's naked body form. I believe it was jealousy talking when the Queen got her pants must be worn order your Father obeyed in doing after she successfully got him poisoned."
Guardian didn't say a word removed the towel to sling it onto the dresser. He went to put on the black sweats. He wound up finding the sweats fit him loosely around his form but clutch to his waist and ankles. The pants he felt were like his familiar sweatpants to him.
He spoke "Anything else I should know of regarding my Father and the Queen's relationship with each other? This poisoned status the Queen did to my Father sounds like he was acting too childish and not taking her seriously as an equal in the marriage. I think my Father was poisoned the Queen fed up with being flaunted as a trophy to the public.”
He heard in response "The King doesn't admit any medical issues towards the staffs in meetings in the Main office. That admittance is frowned for Kings to do towards the public. He must appear to have suffered some medical issue visibly is when medical attention will be done onto him. Your medical issues are to be relayed to your personal physician the butler himself. This is done whenever you order him to your presence in private of your sleeping quarters anytime you wish. Your physician is on call every day every hour waiting to hear from you of any medical issues while you take residence here. As for any medical issues elsewhere it's my responsibility to see that you receive medical treatment while out traveling. The medical assistance is done once it's obvious you need it as you indicated it by your behavior. I have to figure out if you need the medical help or not. Regardless of you not permitted of saying anything related to that subject towards me."
Guardian frowned hearing Herod's words as he eyed Herod to hear from the butler "Excuse me. Herod but His Majesty needs his rest so make this short now."
He eyed Herod in response who spoke "I'll talk to you later on what you need to know regarding the King position excuse me."
He saw Herod leave the room followed by the butler. Guardian gave off a soft sigh sound and got into bed pulling the blankets up to his chest.
He wound up thinking to himself sensing the Meritanians scanning his mind "Who's this Mason aka Herod my General anyway? What's his purpose other than this vision ability to see various scenarios in his mind?"
Guardian stared at the ceiling seemingly lengthy hearing silence from the Meritanians. 
He groaned softly as he wound up hearing unexpectedly "Mason aka Herod your General is one of those deathless people like you that Egyptia is counting on to keep planetary order within the planet herself. Mason's job in question he aware of it is to assist you on targeting deathless people causing damage to Egyptia. The targeting deathless people is by either removing them on a permanent basis or teaching those people that the planet and her functions come first then humanoids second."
He exhaled a breath hearing Yerra's words as Tut was heard "Besides the bodyguard who fathered Olivia didn't really die as led to believe. Daisuke made a deal with him on letting him alive to raise Olivia as her Father raiser. This was done after admitting to the bodyguard of what he was supposedly being doing towards him."
He stiffened hearing Tut's words as the Meritanian continued "Olivia's Father really did die from a medical ailment once his health got to the point that he couldn't live anymore. Olivia from mind scans of her knows that her Father raiser is her actual Father. Her Mother raiser Rita is not aware of that fact. Your sister knows that her Mother was someone else other than her Mother raiser despite leading Rita to believe otherwise."
Guardian remained silent in response as he felt sleepiness hitting him to hear "Go to sleep you need the rest anyway."
He groaned softly turned onto his side and shut his eyes passing out unconscious. 

Guardian came to hearing the familiar alarm clock blaring its ringing noises. He reached with a hand to turn the alarm clock off along with turning on the lamp. Guardian heard a door knocking sound in a code of three knocks to him on the bedroom's door. He sat up as the butler arrived into the room pushing a cart he smelled from the smells contained nourishment making his stomach rumble in hunger. He got up and went to the eating table to sit. Guardian patiently waited as the butler placed in front of him a tray holding nourishment in dishware. He frowned seeing the butler putting cups of three drinks all appearing to look like milk to him next to the tray on the table. Guardian found he terribly hungry forced he to take his time eating the food. He found his eating and drinking was assisted by the butler having hands onto his hands onto the silverware and cups. He sighed once all the nourishment was consumed is when he gave off another sigh sound once done. 
He spoke towards the butler as the male removed the tray and cups back into the cart "What's my agenda on for the day as traditionally done anyway?"
He frowned as the butler spoke after looking at him "Your agenda is told to you via the staff in the Main office actually. I'm not included in that matter so go into the bathroom and attend to your personal hygiene. I'll see that your attires are properly laid on the bed waiting for you once you're done."
Guardian sighed softly and without another word went into the bathroom to shower fully cleaning he as well as he could. He then dried himself fully including his hair via hair dryer. 
He figured to himself "I'll leave my hair down instead of pulled back the public seeing me with it down." 
He walked out of the bathroom clad in a towel carrying his pajama pants to put them onto a dresser's top. Guardian frowned finding the butler still in the room that spoke ahem sound. He sighed and ditched the towel onto the dresser to put on the clothes finding the underwear and socks were of better quality. He found himself still issued the armored vest. Guardian didn't complain to wearing including putting on his clothes by himself and doing the same to his shoes. He found the shoes this time appeared to be sneakers in entirely black color that clung to his ankles and feet. Guardian frowned to feel the pants he was wearing drape themselves over the ankle parts of the sneakers. Guardian gave the butler a glare once done dressing himself who looked him up and down.
The butler he heard speaking "I'm to lead you to the Main office as protocol requires it. You as my King and required for private staff members to do the leading towards you around here. As for the public being present in the residence you're required to lead the way towards public only allowed areas with assigned staff members following behind. Excuse me." 
He wordlessly followed the butler to the Main office. Guardian found the male knocking on the door. He saw one of the bodyguards opened the door allowing him inside. Guardian finding the Queen seated in a chair in front of the desk still holding Nicky. She he saw was appearing to be feeding Nicky by a bottle's nipple into the baby's mouth. He saw the bottle was indicating of blood's contents while held in the Queen's hand. She ignored him looking appearing to concentrate all her attention onto Nicky sucking the bottle's contents. 
He looked away and went to sit down at the desk's chair to speak loudly "Report now."
Guardian folded his arms to hear ahem noise from Herod.
He eyed Herod who added speaking "Excuse me I must broach a subject that is personal. So what do you know of mating? What experience do you have in that area regarding relationships with females?"
He eyed Herod and spoke "I was raised by a midwife who was very clearly crystal clear to me on her job and its duties. I do know what the results of such mating behavior results in offspring forming if there aren’t any kinds of protection done to prevent that. The midwife was very crystal clear on what types of safety issues to be used for a mating to prevent offsprings from forming. The prevention was to be used between a male and a female mating which involves medical intervention actually."
Guardian heard a groan from Herod who shut his eyes rubbing a hand on his forehead.
He heard "Actually Herod is trying to know if you have experience in doing such mating behaviors yourself onto females including courting them for relationships. This followed by doing anything mating wise towards them in question."
Guardian exhaled a breath hearing that from the Queen to find her looking at him with a frown. He saw the Queen was still feeding Nicky his bottled drink that appeared to be taking his time sucking the bottle's contents to him. 
Guardian sighed and spoke from memories within his mind "Alright I do have experience in that area when it comes to courting females. The courting happened when I went to high school from ages seventeen to nineteen. Including attending high school sporting events my Mother raiser allowed me to attend which happened before her light got extinguished. The females have been habitually have been using me to make a male mate friend of theirs jealous enough to take them back after the male did the relationship breakup as always. I'm aware of that stunt played one of females got friendly with me rejected my advances of a courtship. She managed to keep the friendship to tell me of that joke played by females to make their males jealous. This jokey stunt continued played onto me over and over while I attended the high school. This stunt wound up played too much to the point that I wasn't sure about what the female wants. Her wants have me confused if it was me she wanted herself or she was doing some trick to make her targeted male jealous enough to court her or take her back after such relationship was broken up. One of those males wound up taking this jealousy too far by trying to get me sick with a medical ailment. It involved poisoning me via some alcoholic bottle and making it seem I drank out of suicide. I received medical help in a timely fashion which wound up intervening and saved my life as a result. I've been avoiding females targeting me for courtships as a teenager that trick played onto me too much. The trick has gotten me too suspicious of females pouncing onto me hence I preferring to do the courting instead. Unfortunately the courting I do onto females has resulted in them rejecting me and giving various excuses to me to avoid courtship. Besides there were females who didn't protest to me checking their body forms out who seemed amused to me doing it."
He clamped his mouth shut once done to hear Herod groaning again and eyed the General who still had his hand covering his eyes. 
He frowned Herod removed his hand to speak "Blast he confirmed what was rumored going on regarding him at a high school. He confirmed the rumor even when background checks were done onto him after he was revealed as the King's son to us. This female courtship bit isn't going to be easy for him as expected. That's this trickery repeatedly played onto him will make it hard for him to trust a female enough to get paired to one as his companion and Queen in question."
He sighed in response to Herod's words as he eyed the Queen in response who formed a glare before she speaking "Tell me more on this female who kept the friendship with you despite rejecting courtship advances."
Guardian spoke "Her name was Melinda Long as said to me. That despite hearing others use the name of melon to her even in my presence in some jokey way she didn't find amusing. She became friendly with me out of pity of me being used by females. She became friendly enough to tell me of that stunt and her pity feelings towards me. Anyway she was friendly with me before she graduated high school during cycles I went there. She wound up acting as my advisor towards handling females using me for a stunt. I haven't kept in touch with her since I was kicked out of the high school. This kicked out status happened once my declared age of nineteen was flaunted to my face as a reason to leave the school. Her parents I believe must have gotten to Melinda and told her to break off the friendship. 
It's from receiving a letter in some masculine handwriting ‘Your to breaking off the correspondence or be thrown in jail of accusations of being a stalker.’ 
The letter stated that Melinda's parents had proof of that stalker behavior despite not saying what it was."
He sighed and continued "I lost touch with Melinda as a result. My contact Warwick as he's called during contacts kept balking on giving me any information on her. Warwick has repeatedly said to me he would deliver correspondence from me to her. He balked on handing me anything from her in response. I kept up the letter writing correspondence towards Melinda with Warwick doing the delivering as he claimed he was doing. This stopped once I reached the declared age of twenty three by Warwick saying it to me. He wound up telling me that Melinda was no longer in Mahalia continent but elsewhere. Warwick refused to say where only said she was busy with schooling and didn't have time to focus onto reading correspondence letters."
Guardian groaned softly before adding "Warwick has managed to get me to drop the subject a lunar cycled month later after correspondence was stopped. I haven't brought it up with him again since. I have heard no word from Warwick on what's going on with Melinda at all despite receiving postcards from all over Egyptia. All the postcards have been addressed to my home residences with Warwick's name as the addressee in her handwriting on them. 
The postcards have always said a familiar ‘Wish you were here!’ comment on it. 
That included no written signature to indicate she was the one who wrote them."
He clamped his mouth shut to frown while eyeing the Queen who spoke “Interesting seems this Melinda Long has gotten your eye enough to want to pursue her in a courtship. Hence you were keeping contact with her in question and she sharing the same feelings in question."
Guardian frowned hearing that as Herod spoke loudly "Melinda Long? Is that her name as given to you or as called by the school in question?"
He spoke "It's the name used by the teachers using it in homeroom class with her when it comes to attendance taken. Other students have been teasing her by calling her by this word of melon a short version of her name. We took up the friendship after I confronted some males picking onto her in some rude way. The picking was based on her appearance of being a Columbian. The males picked onto me in response my looks was twin to her Columbian looks actually."
He frowned to eye Herod who formed a golden eyed look cocking his head before shutting them. 
He frowning wondering what the General was up to before hearing "Humph she either was a spy for the Brittany nation sent to find you or just a descendant of a Columbian taken residence in Mahalia. Nick had that spying happen to him just prior to finding me for a courtship."
Guardian shifted to eye the Queen who still held Nicky to notice the baby had stopped his bottle sucking and was seemingly sleeping held in her arms.
The Queen he looked at continued speaking "Columbia's current King has secret communication correspondence towards Nick. Columbia's King has made no secret towards Nick in correspondence of having one of the Brittany natives' royal families married into his family. Including how Brittany's ruler reacted towards that was to keep it under wraps instead of flaunting it all over the place in Brittany or in Columbia. Columbia's current King at the moment during correspondence Nick shared with me seems confused on why Brittany's ruler is keeping this marriage fact out of public eye at the moment. That despite the marriage is still reportedly going strong."
Guardian frowned further as the Queen paused to frown before adding "Brittany has been well known to attempt retakes of nations that were formerly underneath their rule. This retake attempt has happened repeatedly after they were thrown out by revolutions. They have kept on pulling this retake stunt over and over towards independent nations formerly underneath their control. Their not sparing Columbia and Mahalia either. 
Columbia's King has said during correspondences ‘Brittany stopped their takeover attempts once a member of their monarch's family was married into Columbia nation's royal family.’ 
This was done towards his youngest grandson kept out of the public eye at the moment via their youngest granddaughter who also was kept out of the public eye too. I heard that both met each other in the Republics of Tsar for some schooling in dance dubbed ballet. They unaware of who they were got together in some heavy courtship relationship and refused to break it off once their identities were pointed out to each other. The pair has both insisted on marriage to happen to each other period which was done with no protests from either nation's ruling monarch. As for the marriage it was kept in secret according to Columbia's King from the natives of Columbia and the natives of Brittany in question. They don't seem to be aware of them being a part of either nation's royal family as enforced by Brittany's King on keeping it a secret."
He formed a frown on his face while eyeing the Queen who met his eyes and kept talking "Columbia's King has said during correspondences that he's rather confused to why Brittany's King would keep this pairing a secret instead of flaunting it publicity and kept on insisting it be a secret. The excuse of not flaunting the pairing as always was related to the couple's ages of when they married each other as claimed to be in their late teens. That includes not sharing any information such as any pictures of the couple or any evidence of who they are."
Guardian sighed softly as Herod spoke "I suspect that Columbia's King was hinting on Brittany's royal family already sending a member to be a spy for them to Mahalia. The spying was to seek out Victor himself including seeing on what can be done to ensnare him into a marriage trap. I suspect that was what he was trying to say in his correspondence hence his odd subject at the moment."
He shifted to eye Herod to hear from the Queen loudly "Actually Nick figured out another theory related to the correspondence's theme. The theory he had was that Columbia sent a member of their royal family to Mahalia to ensnare Victor into a marriage trap. It was to keep Brittany from playing such stunt onto him. Besides if Mahalia and Columbia were to have a very public alliance it'll get Brittany to back off on doing their takeover attempts over either nation. Perhaps back off on any retake attempts on any nation in question once it was obvious that both nations were joined in agreement publicity. The joint alliance publicity flaunted to keep Brittany nation from doing any takeover behavior towards other nations. Those nations in question would follow the example of Mahalia and Columbia and form alliances among each other to keep Brittany from taking them over into their rule. Besides what Mahalia and Columbia does towards Brittany doing takeover attempts is reportedly copied by the other nations at the moment. Those nations somehow see Mahalia and Columbia as leaders of this rebellion in preventing Brittany doing a takeover and keeping their independence intact."
Guardian frowned eyeing the Queen in response to hear "Figures on what your saying my Queen. I should have realized what was really going on regarding this Melinda Long having a relationship with Victor. Her parents wound up stupidity breaking off the correspondence not knowing who he was. It appears that Warwick knew who this Melinda Long really was enough to encourage Victor and her to keep in contact with each other. Hence they both receiving correspondence he passed as the go between, between them in question. Warwick on heavy questioning just prior to light extinguished made it clear to me that he was playing matchmaker between Victor and this Melinda to be paired together. He even sounded belligerent when he got me to oath that I would see this relationship resulted into a marriage period. Unfortunately his light extinguished before he could tell me further information on this female he named as Melinda Long he was matching up towards Victor in question."
Guardian kept the frown on his face while eyeing Herod to hear a door knocking sound to find one of the bodyguards answering the door revealing Daisuke to his annoyance. He saw Daisuke was flaring his all black eyed look while dressed in Samira clothes. He heard ugh sound from the Queen to find Daisuke walking into the room to stop who folded his arms. Guardian frowned seeing Daisuke's attention of narrowed eyes was appearing to be aimed at Herod who appeared to gulp repeatedly. 
He eyed Herod who appeared to gulp before then clearly speaking "Melinda Long is her name. She is a student of Finely Town high school in West Allied state during the two cycles Victor attended that school. Her appearance is indicating of being a Columbian. Victor and Melinda had a correspondence relationship which was broken up by some male reportedly her Father writing to Victor himself to break off. Warwick or one of them just prior to death confessed on playing some matchmaker game between Melinda and Victor himself. Warwick confessed to keeping correspondences open between them as the go to between persons passing onto them correspondences. He on his deathbed was belligerent on seeing the both of them married. He made me oath that it'll happen period then had his light extinguished before he could give further information onto this female he was pairing towards Victor in question."
Guardian sighed softly while eyeing Daisuke warily who spoke using his familiar creepy voice tone while looking at him "What's this Melinda Long's habit involving clothing she wears and her hair styled?"
He sighed and recalled fully to speak "She appeared to be a Farmer's daughter judging by the look of one always wearing blue jean overalls, plaid shirt of whatever color and boots on her feet that appeared to be for hiking. Her hair was always pulled back into three styles of a ball, a tail or a hair banded braid that looked very neatly done to me. The hair is always neat instead of messy like I always seen from females regardless of them dressed twin to hers. She habitually wore dark rimmed glasses on her face she admitted to me via written correspondence that those glasses were ordered for her to wear them by her Father raiser who didn't want males targeting her for relationships. Her Father raiser somehow found out about the correspondence sent me a letter threatening me with jail for doing stalker like behavior. He said in his letter hinting that he had proof of the stalker behavior. The behavior wasn't explained what it was. Warwick wound up asking me during a private meeting on whether if there were any females I had my eye on which I admitted my friendship with Melinda Long herself. He talked about seeing that we'll keep in touch with each other period. That keep in touch only involved me writing letters to her. She never responding via letter method and Warwick managed to quit that once I was twenty three. Soon after I was that declared age is when I started receiving postcards addressed to Warwick at residences I was staying. The postcards were from all over Egyptia in Melinda's handwriting with some wish you were here comments always written on them and never included her name."
He clamped his mouth shut as Daisuke spoke "Excuse me."
Guardian frowned as Daisuke held up a hand followed by a flash of light to reveal a female dressed similar to the Queen around his age. She he saw appeared to panic before seeing Daisuke getting a hold of her and appearing to be whispering in her ear calming her down. He frowned as he saw her shaking her head of confusion while looking around the room before focusing onto him with recognition and a familiar look with her blue eyes making him confused as to where he's seen her before. 
Guardian felt himself confused as Daisuke was heard "Yes your eyes aren't deceiving you Melinda as your known by him. This is Guard Beers himself the King of Mahalia aka Yevgeny Alexander Visser as he'll be publicity known."
He stiffened from Daisuke's words as the female spoke sounding familiar "Argh! No wonder this Warwick guy kept on insisting on pairing us together. My Father raiser kept telling me that there was someone else in mind I should target with marriage on my mind. Turns out the target my Father raiser wanted me to target was him all along."
He exhaled a breath to stand up from the desk unfolding his arms realizing the female was Melinda herself as Daisuke was heard "Talk on who you really are now Melinda. I'll see that Yevgeny aka Victor as he's known around here will accept you in marriage period."
Guardian frowned hearing Daisuke's words as Melinda he eyed with a frown formed a frown and spoke "Alright my name is actually Jacinda Jensen. I'm a descendant of the Columbia nation's royal family. The descendant is from Columbia's King's youngest daughter who's secretly married to a Scandinavia nation native hence the last name. Columbia's King George White Feather my Grandfather after news of Victor sent me to Mahalia to ensnare him in a marriage trap. The ensnaring was just to make an alliance between Mahalia and Columbia permanent. My Grandfather came upon this theory that if both nations had a permanent alliance aka connection to each other via their royal families. It'll cause Brittany to back off on their takeover attempts. My Grandfather through written correspondence has been complaining of being fed up with Brittany's repeated propaganda. The correspondence has been complaints involving Brittany taking his nation into some takeover attempt being successful through broadcasts within Columbia. The Brittany's broadcasts have been forcing him to publicity broadcast that the nation was still under independence repeatedly. He's indicated that he's desperate for this alliance to happen period."
Guardian didn't say a word in response as Jacinda he assumed he'll call her stopped talking. He walked around the desk and went towards her as if drawn to find her raising her palms to meet his palms. He jerked as he felt an intense charge of pleasure running through him from the palms' meeting before gently leaning forwards to shut his eyes and met Jacinda's lips with his lips. He wound up feeling another charge of pleasure hitting him once their lips met. He kissed her in response as she moved her lips to meet his movements. 
Guardian heard blared in his mind "Walls."
He frowned at the word as he saw clearly in his mind was a wall of stone while feeling Jacinda's lips turn into a palm he felt kissing making himself annoyed. 
He mentally spoke "Walls."
Guardian saw the stone wall of white in his mind drop down in a fast move to hear via ears "Get Victor to quit that behavior now!"
He frown hearing the sneering voice tone of the Queen.
Guardian wound up hearing a voice speaking in a Compeller's voice tone "You will quit the lips' ritual and see Jacinda step away and disappear in a light show."
Guardian obeyed to find one hand was holding onto the maid's hand while she had a hand over his lips' mouth's area. 
He quit the hand holding to speak "I'll see you again Jacinda." 
He saw the maid walk off out of his eyesight. He shut his eyes to rub a hand over his lips making himself appear besotted with Jacinda. 
Guardian heard "Bloody Hades, get Victor to quit that behavior now!"
He frowned inwardly to hear the Queen's snarling voice tone. 
Guardian heard a Compeller's voice speaking "You will quit acting lovey dovey and resume your King's titled duties now."
Guardian obeyed to form a glare on his face and removed his hand to look around the room to find Daisuke not in sight. He found Herod seated on the couch looking annoyed by the expression on his face with golden eyes. Guardian frowned eyeing the Queen seated at the desk in the desk's seat he grimaced seeing her having a sneer on her face. 
He eyed the Queen who spoke "Tell me what this Guardian of Life and Death bit you are is."
He kept his mouth shut in response to hear blared behind him in a Compeller's voice "You will admit this Guardian of Life and Death now, Victor."
Guardian mentally spoke "Walls." 
He felt the compulsion to talk not there. He got a headache hitting his head to bend down groaning in pain loudly with hands covering his eyes them shut. He saw fully in his mind the events of the helicopter accident were real but a trick to find out who he was really. 
Guardian fumed to himself as he kept on groaning from the headache "Bloody Hades, the Queen rigged that helicopter explosion. Just to either kill me or have me reveal who I am to her. I wound up doing that by revealing this Guardian of Life and Death duty to her. Hence she using a Compeller to trick me into thinking I was kissing a female."
He stiffened as he heard "Herod what's Victor saying hmm? You're fluent in that gibberish Victor is speaking he inherited from Nick himself."
Guardian felt the headache stop to his relief. He wound up to stand up straighten his form to glare at the Queen hearing silence from Herod behind him. He jabbed a finger aimed at the Queen and recalled fully of how to activate his Guardian abilities. He noticed the Queen's sneer turn more sneering as he glared. Guardian activated his Guardian's Egyptia ability by dropping a see through wall in his mind. 
Guardian spoke recalling his duty as Egyptia's protector from manoids "I won't have you destroy Egypt and her natural order of life for humanoids to survive living in her. The planet comes first then humanoids come second after that. Don't deter me from doing what it takes to protect Egypt from you and your damaging destruction. I am the Guardian of Life and Death. I determine with Egypt's input who lives and whose light gets extinguished. Don't interfere with my work."
He glared at the Queen whose sneer remained but saw she had fear in her eyes. Guardian felt himself confused to why he referred Egytpia as Egypt. He kept his Guardian ability active to glare at her while pointing a finger aimed at her. Guardian then willed his power's aside to fold his arms forming a glare aimed at her. Guardian found the sneer was still on her face but she appearing to look nervous. 
He heard the Queen spoke "What do you have to say about having a freak excuse for a King, Herod? You still want to serve him hmm?"
He stood sideways away from the Queen to look at Herod due to thinking "Its best not to turn my back onto the Queen entirely. She's up to something by this stunt pulled onto me."
Guardian eyed Herod seated on the couch. He wound up finding one of the bodyguards behind the male having a handgun pointed at Herod's head. Guardian grimaced seeing the bodyguard thrusting the weapon further onto the Herod's head in some pushing method. 
He glared at Herod who spoke "The gun isn't necessary my Queen, so call off your dog now."
He heard as the bodyguard kept the gun pointed at Herod in response to the talk "Why pray tell should I do that hmm?"
He frowned hearing nervousness in the Queen's voice tone while hearing from Herod "Who's going to translate that gibberish? Victor seemed too inherited from his Father you heard complaining about my Queen? You sounded like you're not fluent in that gibberish like language like I am."
He shifted to glare at the Queen who stopped her sneer instead had a frown on her face. This was followed by hearing loudly a gun's safety clicking on he recognizing the sound. Guardian kept his eyes onto the Queen with them narrowed in a glare as she formed nervousness onto her face. 
He glared at the Queen who spoke sounding nervous "Alright Herod has a point on his talk regarding the gibberish like language. Victor or should I say Yevgeny Alexander spoke. Anyway excuse me I have business that requires me out of here."
He kept the glare as the Queen got up from the desk's seat. Guardian saw her faded from view to hear a crying noise sounding loudly he recognizing it from Nicky. He eyed Nicky held in the maid's arms to find the Queen appearing next to her. 
He figured "The Queen used a super speed running method."
Guardian saw the Queen grab the baby and again faded from view. He heard the doors to the room manipulated with a loud bang sound. Guardian shifted to eye Herod. He wound up finding the bodyguard who had the gun pointed at the General was gone from the room. He noticed along with another bodyguard. Guardian noticed that there were two bodyguards in the room while hearing a Tsk sound from the maid behind him. He faced Herod entirely with back to the maid.
Guardian mentally spoke "Walls."
He found the scene refused to change to his confusion. He shifted to eye the maid in a glare who walked up towards him. Guardian saw her pulled out a pair of glasses from her pocket to put on. He saw with shock was Melinda Long from the stunt joke played onto him. 
Guardian gave the maid a glare who spoke "The Queen played a jokey stunt of having a Compeller one of your bodyguards. To compel you into believing I was your Melinda Long from your high school when I wasn't."
He glared at her as she added ignoring his glaring "This Melinda Long is currently being searched at the moment from what you said of her. As for Jacinda Jensen it's my actual name. I have no relations towards Columbia's King at the moment. I do have relations toward Scandinavia. I did come from there to settle into Mahalia for refugee status. The refugee status wound up granted by your Father. He wound up hired me into serving him based on my knowledge of Scandinavia and its ruler the Queen Ingrid. Your Father wanted inside information on Scandinavia. I gave it to him in return of this maid job to hide myself from anyone seeking me out. Sorry I can't say why I'm a refugee from there. Your Father said to keep this fact to myself for security reasons actually. Anything else I should admit Herod?"
He shifted to glare at Herod who he saw was standing instead of sitting from the couch that shook his head in a humanoid no gesture. 
Herod he heard speaking "She's a spy from Queen Ingrid actually."
Guardian stiffened hearing words blaring in his mind from Herod who kept up his gibberish talk. 
He wound up hearing the language translation in his mind "Queen Ingrid isn't the only ruler having spies underneath your employ at the moment. There's others sensed around serving. I'm not sure why their spying at the moment. Besides Brittany nation seems to have some obsession in wanting to retake Mahalia underneath their rule. Its how focused they seemed to be aimed at this nation than any other nation formerly underneath them gaining independence-"
He heard ahem sound interrupting Herod's talk who added speaking "Anything else you want to admit Miss Jensen?"
He frowned hearing Herod speaking in Britain language as dubbed for Mahalia's natives to speak and language's uses. The natives still kept up as the Mahalia's national language use. He shifted to glare at Jacinda who removed the glassed and put them into a pocket of her dress before eyeing him. 
Jacinda he heard wound up speaking "Why is Olga claiming that Victor is blind in the dark? Explain that bit, Victor."
Guardian sighed as he recalled fully "I can see in the dark myself."
He wound up speaking "I'm not blind in the dark. I was faking my blindness actually."
He frowned to clamp his mouth shut as Jacinda walked up towards Herod he eyed her. 
This was followed by her speaking "Every Mahalia native born on this island continent has the ability to see in the dark. It's from what I know of your Father's bragging it towards me. He kept up that braggart behavior including some courtship feelings aimed at me whenever his wife wasn't around to see it happen. I admit it that he was doing the courtship to spite his wife's negative nitpicky attitude aimed at him. That including trying to get over being poisoned by her."
Guardian frown eyeing Herod in response he spoke "Your Father whined complaints towards me that he couldn't permanently put his wife down in some assassination method. He whined about this after it came out that she compelled people to get her paired towards him including compelling people to implant her with Olga."
He spoke "Don't tell me this bit involving Stepmother was some attitude of being power mad to rule Mahalia in a King position but this time using the Queen title."
He glared at Herod who he heard ahem sound to find the General frowned and not ahem speaker he assumed was a bodyguard. He wound up noticing Jacinda putting a hand on the male's arm that was folded with his other arm across his chest.
Herod spoke as another ahem sounded "Alright the Queen's power mad attitude was related to jealousy aimed at your Mother for conceiving you naturally via mating ways. That's despite Olga wound up implanted inside her. Her carrying of Olga gave her lots of trouble medical wise. That required her bedridden and receiving lots of blood transfusions. Olga from the doctor's tests drank blood from within her Mother carrying her hence she bedridden a lot from losing so much blood. Olga was surgically taken out. It was obvious she wasn't getting out via birth natural way or her Mother getting into a sleep status for that birthing to happen."
Guardian spoke "The bodyguard that targeted the Queen? What's going on with that involving Talia and her conceiving?"
He got from Herod who he noticed took Jacinda's hand to grip "The bodyguard that target the Queen with a courtship, had some thought theory that your Father didn't love her and was using her as trophy judging by the looks of her. The Queen just prior to Olga's implantation was looking twin to one of the actresses producers was looking for, for their movies. She was a movie star just prior to taking Your Father's hand in marriage after snaring him into a trap."
Guardian frowned forming it on his face as Herod continued "Besides soon after she started carrying Olga is when her appearance shifted into a Northern Columbian. It's a look twin to your Father currently which you have yourself. It was after Olga was taken out is when her look became permanent. He wound up flaunting her as from Northern Columbia and claiming she was a part of their royal family hence the term trophy wife used. Now as for the bodyguard he was targeting the Queen on account that he didn't approve of your Father's trophy wife's status towards her. He was reportedly trying to get her out of that trophy wife status by targeting her. Just to break up her marriage towards your Father. I do confess but there were cameras recording in the gym room where the bodyguard was seen mating with the Queen."
He groaned softly as Herod kept talking "The Queen via recorders appeared to not resist to the bodyguard mating with her. She instead was appearing to look out of it. The Queen heard saying your Father's name repeatedly. She was mistakenly thinking the bodyguard was your Father himself hence his name used. When the bodyguard was done with his mating job is when she appeared to faint after giving out a declaration of love towards your Father in question."
Guardian spoke "Then what's with my Father mating with that actress that created me anyway?"
He frowned eyeing Herod to see the male looking at Jacinda to hear ahem noise loudly. Guardian frowned eyeing the maid to notice that she was his Mother raiser's age.
He wound up hearing from her "Your Father met me in the hallway of the hotel actually. Your Father came onto me in private of a hotel room after I let him into a room. I wound up pregnant with you."
He gasped of shock sensing her words were the truth. 
Jacinda continued talking "The use of an actress was actually an excuse to the public to explain who your Mother was. There is a Victoria Lynn. She wound up pregnant at the same time I was carrying you actually. Victoria Lynn's baby wound up put down after he was born. The put down was some medical condition as law states for such light's to be extinguished towards babies. Victoria Lynn in question wasn't told of the put down status. She instead was led to believe her baby lived by the midwife attending to her who switched babies with my baby. I was aware of that switcheroo actually by the midwife. The midwife made it seem that your Father's offspring was fathered via Victoria Lynn herself when it was via me actually. Your Father kept up the deception of Victoria Lynn having his baby to his wife. He was keeping tabs onto you via Warwick given input from me on how to do things around Mahalia."
He sighed softly as Jacinda's hand got kissed by Herod which he spoke "You two together or what?"
He eyed Herod who spoke "Actually she's my wife. Jacinda worked in a hotel at the time of her getting pregnant with you. I managed to get your Father to put me into this General position after I worked my way up through the battle groups to gain this title legally. He agreed to have my wife work for him. That including input on what to do towards caring towards Sparky then Nicky."
He spoke as Herod stopped talking "Does Stepmother know of this talk you're both telling me?"
He heard "Yes she knows. Your Father blabbed soon after she got him into some mating ritual. He always talks whenever she does some kind of mating ritual towards him."
Guardian groaned softly hearing Jacinda's words.
He eyed her who added noticing his stare "Herod had to convince the Queen to back off on targeting me with the excuse of us being married and Mother of his son. I do have a male offspring. He's your brother that is currently in a battle group in Columbia's island nation of Megiddo. Mahalia has some agreement with Megiddo's ruler to keep a base on one of their islands on a permanent basis. I'm not even sure of the reason despite my husband doesn't want to talk about it. He keeps on hinting its bad really bad and keeps swearing Bloody Hades whenever he tells me this talk."
Guardian frowned to eye Herod who spoke after hearing ahem sound "Sorry I'm not at liberty to say towards you. I oath I wouldn't say. Besides shouldn't you meet the Queen in the dining room for a meal? You need nourishment anyway. Don't worry about this talk. She ordered us to tell you it actually hence she pulling a disappearing act involving her ability to run very fast hence she appearing to fade from view. Every Queen of Mahalia is given this ability to run very fast. Every King is always given an ability to detect them being spied on. Don't ask me how they gotten that ability hitting them it's always there period."
Guardian groaned and without a word walked out of the room sensing the remaining two bodyguards escorting him. He sensed them following him from behind by his spying senses telling him that. He went to the dining room as if from memory of where it was despite no compulsion orders done. Guardian found the Queen seated at the head of the table that formed a sneer seeing him.
This was followed by her speaking "I see you met your Mother, Jacinda, Herod's wife. He's in love with at the moment. The marriage towards your Mother was recent at the beginning of this cycle. It was when Herod took this job actually and not when you were conceived."
Guardian willed forwards his planet protecting ability to give the Queen a glare.
She stopped sneering to form a nervous expression followed by she speaking "Alright your Father sort of whenever I'm manipulating him in some mating ritual in the morning he always talks. Your Father confessed that he ordered Herod to marry Jacinda once it was obvious that she was carrying you. Your Father was aware of who carried you. Hence he was telling me all sorts of talk involving an actress carrying you. He also confessed to letting the midwife raise you while keeping tabs onto you in question. Your Father realized that Herod marrying your Mother would prove to be a good excuse to keep her alive. It was mostly away from me and my jealousy attitude of assassinations toward her. Herod being your Mother's husband and later Father of your brother through your Mother was used as excuses to keep her alive towards me. Once I found out who your Mother really was after I did some mating behavior manipulation onto your Father in the morning."
He kept the Guardian ability active to narrow his eyes aimed at the Queen.
She kept talking sounding of nervousness to him "Unfortunately your Father had recently put sound recorders placed into private residences including our bedroom. The recorders caught me in the act multiple times of manipulating him to talk via mating ways. It also was including overhearing what questions I used onto him. He wound up using the recordings in some blackmail scheme to counterattack my poisoning him. Your Father used the recordings onto me whenever I gave out orders of assassinations towards your Mother he refused to carry out."
He glared at the Queen while willing aside the Guardian ability. 
She continued talking "I do confess that his reasons for keeping me home instead of taking me along for the King's Day celebration is that we had a terrible fighting argument. Your Father threw divorce into my face and ordered me and Olga out of the house immediately. I sort of said something insulting towards your Father. 
It's just prior to him kicking me out of the residence which was along the lines I said ‘I’m wishing for Hades to cause your plane to crash and take you away!’ 
This wish from your talk on Hades appears I got my wish to happen."
Guardian went to sit down next to the Queen after she paused to find a plate full of food placed in front of him along with two cups. He felt himself fine enough to take in nourishment proceeded to do. He finding the food and drinks were normal Egyptian nourishment involving the Mahalia nation. He kept the glare aimed at the Queen. 
He took in nourishment to get from her "Out with it now Victor on what you're implying."
He paused from eating to speak "Why was your appearance altered despite carrying Olga? I didn't see this appearance altered from my Mother who looks like any of the natives of Mahalia other than not looking like an actress's looks."
Guardian glared at the Queen as he continued to eat his food.
The Queen spoke "Actually my appearance was twin to a Northern Columbian when I arrived to Mahalia as a little girl from Megiddo. I grew up in Republic state hence my accent. Once I was the legal age I had my appearance altered to look like one of those actresses in Mahalia focused onto the chest, the hair color. The body which was from starving myself hence I looking rail thin. The starving me status caused havoc within my system while I was carrying Olga. She did really drink blood from within me actually hence I bedridden a lot along with given lots of blood transfusions. The hair color was from some bleach dye used to dye my hair. My chest was actually implants I used some mating ritual onto a doctor to implant me with them for free. I later broke off the relationship once I was implanted with them. The doctor told me to tell other females seeking implants to treat him in some mating way for free implants. I wound up doing as a result. My name is really Svetlana Kremenova despite your Father using the Queen Georgina identity onto the public when introducing me to the natives."
He spoke while jabbing a fork aimed at her "Anna Kremenova who's she?"
He glared at her to hear from the Queen "She's my niece also has a pouch brother herself, through my pouch brother actually. My Mother carried my brother and me together at the same time. My brother was taken out first via surgical method followed by me taken out after him. As for Anna Kremenova, I don't think she knows of me being her Aunt or she wouldn't have gone around publicity pretending to be my daughter. She would have used another method to gain money from me instead of that daughter like status in question. It is what my brother is using towards me. He knows who I am and has used some pouch connection towards me to figure out where I'm hiding enough to demand money from me. I haven't gotten the faintest idea what he does with that money in question. Besides my pouch brother has successfully managed to hide himself from me that I have no idea where's he's hiding or if he's working here among us. He's always using various disguises whenever confronting me for money. He using certain words that I know instantly that he's my pouch brother by the wording used. That triggers my senses to indicate him as that person."
Guardian kept on taking in the nourishment as the Queen paused to look away. He saw her lean over a bassinet to pick up Nicky he heard unexpectedly was wailing loudly. Nicky from the noises, that appeared to get calmed down from her holding the baby by hearing soft cooing sounds. He eyed the Queen who kissed Nicky on the forehead. She, he saw appeared to rock the baby with her arms' swinging in a slow move while looking a look aimed at the offspring with a look he recognized. He sighed softly as he continued to eat his food till everything was consumed. Then sipped his drinks of milk from the taste he finding his senses refused to blare as he sipped the liquid. Guardian cleared his throat to get the Queen looking at him with a frown.
Guardian spoke "Have you arranged a meeting with Olivia Madison is your daughter's name with her yet? I was led to believe that you wanted to meet her."
Guardian frowned to get the Queen grimacing in response followed by her speaking "Alright I admit it I did try to arrange meetings with Olivia as you call her once I had your Father into some poisoned status. Unfortunately this deity answering to the name of Daisuke Yamato has repeatedly balked letting me meet Olivia. He has said to me that he was responsible for the assassination of the bodyguard targeting me inappropriately. He claims it's by some mental ability involved stopping the heart organ. Daisuke used this assassination as reason why I wasn't allowed to see Olivia as his payment price. Including getting her as his wife another payment price for keeping her alive he threatened to assassinate. Daisuke wound up demonstrating some hand mental assassination ability onto one of my bodyguards during a confrontation. The bodyguard didn't make it and got light extinguished. He claims that he put Olivia's Mother raiser down into some assassination method. Once it was obvious she was suffering too much from cancer raging through her system that was giving her a slow death. He also claims that Olivia knew of this assassination hence she seen appearing to dominate the marriage and relationship to people's presences. She, according to Daisuke, was using that light extinguished status as reason why she's the dominator of the relationship."
Guardian frowned as the Queen paused from talking to hold a hand towards' Nicky's outstretched hands to see one of the baby's hands gripped her fingers in a tight grip.
She added once he was done drinking his milk "So tell me does this Guardian of Life and Death you're talking about. Does it only focus onto keeping Egyptia's planetary functions perfect to the planetary world's standards?"
He sighed to hear "She admitted what Daisuke told her to keep quiet. He's aware that she talked towards you. He won't do a thing about it but he will if she tells anyone else of this talk. The bodyguards aren't allowed in the dining room actually."
Guardian sighed again as Yerra stopped talking with his mind to speak from memory flashing within him "The Guardian of Life and Death ability appears to be aimed at whoever is causing destruction towards Egyptia. I don't spare anyone harm from doing that destruction even if it causes assassination towards that person in question. I'll do what it takes to protect Egyptia period."
He leaned back into the chair to glare at the Queen who frowned before speaking "What about humanoids who are appearing to be deathless that can't be assassinated by normal means and immune to medical ailments?"
He inhaled a breath to speak firmly "You're question is related towards removing a certain annoying deity isn't it? Admit it my Queen."
Guardian folded his arms while eyeing the Queen who appeared to gulp before she spoke "This deity when he forbidden me from meeting Olivia, spoke his words in some jokey voice tone including giving off some laughter like sounds in my presence. He refused to explain his behavior towards me. He instead used a threat of light extinguishing Olivia if I were successful in meeting her while speaking in some laughing like voice tone. It really annoyed me when he spoke his threat in that tone hence I thinking he's doing that forbidding to spite me on something I'm not sure what it is."
He spoke "Wouldn't this deity figure out that you poisoned my Father enough to punish you by this forbidding status threat thrown at you?"
Guardian eyed the Queen who formed a grimace on her face followed by a light show. He grimaced seeing Daisuke wearing clothes of a Samira standing next to him having an all black eyed glare while holding a hand curling it into a fist aimed at the Queen. He frowned as the Queen in a fast move placed Nicky into the bassinet and clawed her throat while appearing to be gasping for air.
He heard from Daisuke "You think I won't find out what you're doing towards Nikolas? Such as poisoning him to do whatever madness you wanted? Don't try to meet Olivia period or anything threatening towards me for I'll find out. Believe me you'll receive a lot more than what I'm doing towards you. Now hand me the baby."
Guardian frowned as the Queen shook her head in a no gesture while appearing to be breathing fine followed by Daisuke speaking "Don't tempt me to cause a feeling of deadness to hit your legs. You'll find yourself crippled till I remove that feeling so hand me the baby. I know the baby belongs to Olivia and don't think of any excuses to not to hand him to me."
He frowned eyeing the Queen who appeared to gulp before leaning over to pick up Nicky and handed the baby towards Daisuke who gripped.
Guardian heard from Daisuke "Oh Olga's son I regret to say had his light extinguished. He was suffering too much in pain according to Olivia who insisted that I put him down despite she upset about it."
He saw Daisuke disappear in a light show to get the Queen speaking "Bloody Hades that stupid deity didn't remove that deadness feeling from my legs. I'm now crippled thanks to that stupid idiot."
Guardian frowned as the Queen stopped her chatter to lean back into the chair and saw her folded her arms she looking angry to him. 
He mentally yelled "Yerra! Tut!"
He got his mind scanned sense activating to hear "Daisuke is telling the truth about Olga's son put down. He put the offspring down himself once the baby was indicating it was going to be hospitalized with various medical ailments. It's something Olivia is having a hard time accepting at the moment. Mister Yamato thinks Nicky being her son would help her get over her upset mood. Unfortunately Olivia via mind scans wants another baby via mating way of her carrying it and not via adoption. Too bad Days as she refers him going to find his plan of giving his wife Nicky backfire onto him. Olivia won't accept an adoption of another baby period. Her mind is made up from scanning her."
Guardian felt Yerra leave his mind to focus onto the Queen who grumbled loudly "Bloody Hades!"
He frowned eyeing her as she kept repeating her comment over and over with pauses from the talk. Guardian sighed and made a motion to get up only to see a light show to find Daisuke looking nervous while still holding Nicky. Daisuke he saw thrust the Queen the baby who gripped with a confused expression. He saw the male wave a hand aimed at her before giving off a loud groan. He frowned as Daisuke disappeared in a light show to eye the Queen looking confused.
Guardian spoke "Something tells me that Olivia didn't accept Nicky hence this deity returning the baby and looking nervous. I get the feeling that Olivia prefers this deity to Father her baby via mating way instead of adoption."
He clamped his mouth shut to eye the Queen who stood up before sitting down and heard her groan loudly. 
She heard speaking "You're right on that view. Olga has been whining on wanting another baby via mating way soon after her son was taken away. She has refused to have anything to do with Nicky and his care. Olga instead has left me to care for him by myself with help from your Mother who seems to know how to care for him. I'm not entirely sure of the whole story your Mother regarding when she was pregnant with you. I keep getting put off from asking by Herod getting angry at me whenever I bring up the subject towards your Mother in his presence. Herod keeps confronting me in some angry manner after I keep asking your Mother of this carrying status in private without him there. She has refused to answer my question instead has acted like a wall staring at me with some fearful look on her face. Herod seems to have some kind of psychic ability involving whenever I'm alone with his wife. He barging onto us using the twin appearing ability this deity Daisuke used to be in my presence."
Guardian frowned hearing the Queen's words as his senses blared warning unexpectedly to hear "Herod so nice of you to join us."
He heard the sarcasm in the Queen's voice as he saw her looking pass him. He looked behind him to spot Herod there that had a glare on his face with arms folded.
Guardian frowned forming it on his lips as he eyed Herod who he heard spoke "Interesting choice of words My Queen."
Guardian heard the sarcasm in Herod's voice tone frowned to mentally call for the Meritanians to get "Busy, working on a situation. Sorry can't help now."
He frowned as he eyed the Queen in response to hear loudly "Crazy."
He kept the frown getting a smirk from the Queen despite hearing his Mother's voice speaking that word making him confused. Guardian felt sleepiness hitting him placed his head onto the table onto his arms and shut his eyes feeling himself passing out unconscious.

Part Five: Down

Guardian wound up coming to feeling himself in a box metal all around and naked of clothes. Guardian grimaced as images came to his mind he thrusting his fist into his open mouth to keep himself from screaming loudly. He saw the box was highlighted of green all over he figured was night vision. Guardian removed his fisted hand to quit his screaming as he looked around feeling himself annoyed with the Meritanians for playing a joke onto him again. He grunted as he bounced all around in the metal box banging he onto the walls of it. He adjusted his position to keep from bouncing finding the box was only length wise for his height and body width. Guardian felt himself annoyed as the box slammed down onto something with a loud thud and bang thump felt. He glared at one of the walls of the box in front of him as there was squealing of metal heard. He blinked his eyes from the glare of sunlight shining cutting off his green night vision to spot humanoids with green skin in shades of green colors and green outfits yanked him out of the box into daylight. He finding he aboard some military sea vessel from the looks of the airplanes there and thrust clothes to wear he finding were of an orange jumpsuit. Guardian put on the jumpsuit along with expertly zipping it up. He found himself handcuffed and pushed and pulled with a blindfold placed over his eyes till his seat hit something soft he frowning what it was. He felt himself again chained by wrapping around his ankles and neck followed by a sound of squeaking as he felt himself in motion gliding over the ground.
He figured to he "I'm in chair that has wheels."
Guardian felt something sticky placed over his mouth and nose making him annoyed with that feeling. It felt like an oxygen mask to him as he felt sleepiness shut his eyes and passed out unconscious.

Guardian came to feeling himself in a standing position naked with arms above his head having manacles over his wrists while still wearing a blind fold. 
He grimaced from a stinky smell underneath his nose spoke "Ugh."
He brought his face away from the stink which persisted. 
He heard clapping noises followed by "Enough of the potion now. Take that stink away since its obvious he's not going to drink it."
Guardian frowned hearing the voice for it sounded electronic and female in odd tones that weren't of Mahalia to him. 
He frowned with his lips in that expression as he heard from the voice "What name have you called yourself now?"
Guardian spoke recognizing the language as Meg a part of the Columbia nations island Megiddo to speak in twin language "Depends on what you mean by your question. I've gone with multiple names-"
He was interrupted by feeling pain hitting his back making him grimace cutting off his talk as the voice was heard "I didn't say for you to talk Guard Beers as you call yourself. That despite the Man of Cloth giving you that odd name of Yevgeny Alexander Visser."
He exhaled a breath to frown on his lips as the voice paused then continued "What do you have to say about calling yourself Guardian of Life and Death like some crazy lunatic?"
He clamped his mouth shut in a thin line to hear a faint roaring noise sounding in his mind making him confused to why he was hearing it. He saw an empty wall flash in his mind with some rocky wall hitting it trying to keep it up despite its attempts to go down.
Guardian frowned keeping his mouth in a thin line as the voice repeated its question which he spoke "Oh for crier's sakes!'
He saw the rocky wall stop hitting the see through wall to see it come down he feeling an odd feeling hitting him as he felt pain hit his back again.
Guardian heard "Spill it now on this Guardian of Life and Death you've been sprouting!"
He saw fully in his mind of images making him confused to concentrate onto them fully to find that they cleared up into one image of Herod he recognized speaking in Mahalian language.
He concentrated onto Herod speaking "The Queen has from mind scans of her has both the ability of a Compeller and an Immunes an actual hybrid of one. She has managed to manipulate the Mahalia's natives to believe that there's a King in position by recorder broadcasts of you kept on flaunted all over the place. The Queen still intends to rule Mahalia underneath her influence despite my warnings of Brittany sending a male to court her in a courtship to gain the nation underneath their rule which is what their doing at the moment. She is still power mad at the moment and doesn't care for anything but her own thinking of ruling Mahalia underneath her influence. I can't say much more but you've been sent to Megiddo to a battle group by Mahalia's sea forces having a base there for interrogating you as a lunatic and not doing what the Queen wants you to do. I'll contact later."
He grunted as he felt pain hit his back like electrical zapping as the image of Herod in his mind went out unexpectedly as he heard via ears "Don't daydream smarty. I'll have you suffer more pain if you don't talk on what this Guardian of Life and Death is now!"
Guardian felt the ability still within his mind not itching to take control as he heard a faint roaring sound within him making him further confused. 
He spoke in Megiddo's language of Meg "That depends on what I should tell you. I'll be telling you what you want to hear or don't want to hear. Either way I'll be a lunatic to you anyway."
He clamped his mouth shut to hear "Argh! Let him see where he is now!"
He frowned as he felt the blind fold yanked off his eyes to blink them to stare finding himself underneath a spotlight surrounded by inky darkness while hearing a faint bubbling sound below him. He frowned as he looked below to find his feet on a small platform standing on it appearing to be some diving board from the bouncing feel. He frowned to eye the ground down below was a pool of hot lava to him from the looks of it that was slowly swirling in a circle while in a whirlpool like gesture. Guardian exhaled a breath feeling the heat hitting him abruptly as the platform his feet was on removed itself leaving him dangling over the pool of lava by the manacles digging into his wrists. He looked up and with great strength grabbed the chain's bar lifting himself up to his waist and looked around. 
He glared as he found at the edge of the pool was machinery like tube ball that flashed red lights while hearing the familiar electronic voice speaking "That's not going to help you Mister Beers. All I have to do is press a button and you'll drop into the pool melting yourself to death."
Guardian spoke loudly "Mister Beers? So you made up your mind on what name to call me hmm?"
He glared at the machine to hear "Don't tempt me to have you drop into the pool whatever name you're going around as that other than that ridiculous name of Guard Beers."
Guardian spoke loudly while tightening his holds onto the bar "I agree that name is ridiculous too."
He felt the bar lower itself towards the pool in a jerking move which made him grab the bar's chain to keep on climbing it away from the area. He felt the jerking stop to his relief to glare at the machine finding he still on the same height with that thing but felt the heat became more blaring. 
He glared at the machine who spoke "Bad move Mister Beers. The chain's bar is inside the pool which the heat should travel up to your hands enough to make you let go and fall into it."
He looked down finding the machine wasn't kidding on what it was talking about. Guardian glared at the machine as he felt warmth from the metal hitting his hands and body touching the chain. 
He spoke sounding firm "I already survived a helicopter crash explosion poisoning of liquid and I'll survive this pool's crap."
He glared at the machine as he heard nothing in response as he released his hands and body off the chain to fall down below to hear a bang sound along with grunting once his back hit something metallic instead of the pool's substance to his annoyance. Guardian swung himself up with a karate move to find the pool had a see through cover appearing to be made out of some metal. 
He glared above him at the machine to see it blink red while hearing "Bad move Mister Beers. All I can do is press a button and withdraw the pool's cover and you'll fall through."
Guardian spoke with a firm voice "Fine go ahead and do that instead of telling me how bad my moves are. I'm sick of hearing you telling me that."
He glared at the machine to feel a thump as he felt the pool's cover rising in response to find he getting within eyesight of the machine. 
Guardian glared at the machine in response as he heard "Don't stand there knock him out now! The Eli is indicating a problem so put him asleep now!"
Guardian kept his mouth shut as he grunted from the sleepiness shut his eyes. He felt himself floating in something watery unexpectedly to his confusion and then passed out unconscious.

Guardian came to hearing voices jabbering in gibberish along with Herod's familiar voice sounding angry in twin language tones he hearing it appearing to be an argument. He frowned for the voices sounded like a lengthy argument till he heard grunting noises followed by a Compeller language speaking words he found he understanding.
He heard "I order the Guardian of Life and Death automatically immune to all Compellers' voice orders for only my voice in Compeller tones can belay that order."
Guardian frowned as he heard nothing else passed out unconscious to hear a sound of a weeping noise loudly making him jerk open his eyes with a start. He found himself lying in a bedroom he didn't recognize he seeing his Mother seated at the bed next to him while holding his hand and crying tears. Guardian frowned eyeing his Mother as he felt himself clad in nothing but a blanket covering him up to his chest. 
He eyed his Mother warily who quit weeping to speak noticing him staring "My Herod has gone off Egyptia with those servants of Egyptians in your place."
Guardian groaned softly hearing that as she continued "Herod sacrificed himself for you to remain in Egyptia doing what's important for Mahalia his words not mine."
He frowned fully to speak sensing the Meritanians were manipulating him from senses blaring "Why Herod did keep you from answering questions regarding carrying me?"
He clamped a free hand over his mouth while eyeing his Mother with a frown.
Guardian got from her "Because you were implanted inside me medically."
He removed his hand to place it over her hand holding his right hand as she continued "Your Mother's carrying Olga gave your Father ideas on how to craft a male heir for the title."
Guardian spoke "What do you mean your Mother carrying Olga anyway?"
He frowned to get from her "The Queen is your Mother actually despite I used to carry you."
He stiffened of shock hitting him as she kept talking ignoring his stiffening "A piece of your mother joined with two males your father and Herod himself was implanted inside me that created you to existence. I had quite a difficult pregnancy as a result that required lots of bed rest despite you not draining from me like what happened to your mother carrying Olga. Instead you were stealing my nourishments enough to grow healthy inside me while I got thinner and thinner enough to not gain weight hence the bed rest. The excuse of this Victoria Lynn was used to keep this implantation bit out of the public's eye something your father didn't want to admit to the public about like any other King in position-"
Guardian interrupted "Then what's with me raised by a mid wife and thrown in various ridiculous situations involving me and my lifestyle?"
He frowned to get a glare from Jacinda he assumed he'll call her to get her speaking "Your father did wanted you in his life but he was fearing of you being a spoiled brat and looking at people negatively something that's happened to Olga judging by the way your mother raised her to be."
Guardian frowned forming it on his lips while eyeing Jacinda who got up removing her hand from his hands' grip and adding "You should be sleeping now. You need your rest Robert."
He frowned at the name of Robert as she forced his eyes shut in response to feel he manipulated to keep them shut by the Meritanians. He wound up obeying to the sensation along with making himself appear to be sleeping by the expression on his face and deep breathing.
He heard loudly "Missus James, kindly tell the truth of Robert's carrying status now!"
He heard the Queen's voice sounding angry using a Compeller's voice talent tone to get Jacinda speaking everything she told him speaking it to the Queen in a firm voice tone. Guardian felt urged to roll over obeyed to do it despite hearing a Compeller's voice ordering him to do which he obeyed to throw the blanket over his head covering his form from head to foot. He listened to the Queen's voice using Compeller's tones demanding Jacinda to tell the truth on him being carried by her only to hear Jacinda's voice sounding firm after each compelling what she told him twin talk over and over. 
Guardian grimaced fully on his face as he heard loudly "My Queen I suggested you quit that interrogation. It's obvious that Missus James is talking underneath her husband's compeller voice influence's programming he must have said towards her before he disappeared off Egyptia with those freaks."
He breathed deeply to hear "Nevertheless prepare Victor to those freaks now! I want him out of Mahalia and off Egyptia now!"
He stiffened as the Queen spoke in a Compeller's voice tone her order while feeling the blanket removed from his face along with a needle injected into his neck. He was feeling himself falling unconscious while again still finding himself floating in a water tank from the feel along with sleepiness hitting him. 

Guardian woke up feeling a hand patting his cheek while feeling an odd feeling he wasn't sure what it was while naked of clothes lying onto hot sand that was feeling like burning his back. He jerked open his eyes to find leaning over him was a crowned male he recognized that woke up Owen from a Hades' status. He gave the male a glare as he swung himself up with an acrobatic move to stand with arms folded while glaring at the crowned figure.
He found the male flared Daisuke's all black eyes and speaking "You disgust me on forgetting how to expel drugs from your system by the looks of you indicating it."
He turned his back in response and rolled his eyes ignoring the male's creepy voice tone and felt all the drugs within his body out of his body's system before resuming face the male with arms folded. 
Guardian gave the male a glare who spoke "The name is Lance Richard ruler of the Isle of Forbidden where you have taken residence in on a permanent basis till Egyptia has no use for you is when you can leave."
He exhaled a breath finding Lance Richard he assumed he'll call him wasn't kidding on what he was saying by the firmness of the male's voice tone. 
He eyed Lance Richard warily who added "Use your nose to smell where the restless natives are living at the moment. I'm too busy to help you on this matter excuse me."
He frowned as Lance Richard he saw jumped off a cliff overhang he saw was over a large lake and fell into it feet first. He looked around to discover that he would have to copy Lance Richard's way off the area finding he in a narrow cave with no opening inside. Guardian sighed and without a word jumped only to see a gonoid unsure of the name pop out of the lake with mouth open wide appearing to want to catch him as its nourishment. He gave off a sound of disgust as he fell into the gonoid's mouth feeling himself sliding inside a tunnel of slime and skin like walls all over the place seemingly lengthy to him. He felt himself further disgusted as the slimy mess got into his mouth making him swallow some of it repeatedly while sliding around all over. Till he felt he had an enough of the sliding felt himself airborne out of the tunnel to land into water with a loud splash sound. He coughed up the sliminess while underwater he seeing it was a small lake from the looks of it and forced himself to stand up while gagging loudly. 
He frowned as his nose smelled something stinky making him annoyed to fold his arms and swear "Bloody Hades to Lance Richard!"
Guardian heard a clapping noise in response as he looked off his right to find Lance Richard the hands' source who spoke while showing Egyptian blue eyes "Come along while I show you where you're to wipe that mess off of you that gonoid did onto you for that eating."
He glared at Lance Richard stomped a foot into something slimy and smelly making him further disgusted as he snarled while stomping towards the male "Don't tell me that gonoid was an Egyptian eater."
He glared at Lance Richard as he halted to reach the male who spoke while holding his nose "Egyptia has purposes for manoids living here. Some of those manoids I favor aren't spared the death sentence despite it took me awhile to figure that out. It appears that you're spared of that death sentence despite her throwing you into a manoid's trap."
Guardian gave up a sound of disgust loudly to get from Lance Richard again still holding his nose to his annoyance "Come along while I show you where you're to get rid of that stinky mess you're displaying. It's disgusting."
He mentally spoke to himself "Manoid's death traps. I hope it's the last time I'm going through such trap like that."

Guardian found his thought was for nothing as he found himself suffering multiple manoid's death traps over and over while on the way to the ocean as said by Lance Richard. 
He once arriving to the beach yelled loudly "I get the message that you Egyptia is angry at me hence those stinking manoid death traps you keep throwing me into! So quit it now and leave me in peace!"
He heard from Lance Richard in response still using the nasal voice "Aw just get yourself into the ocean and wash that crap off now."
Guardian obeyed to get himself into the ocean only to realize with a start that he was led to another manoid's death trap this time belonging to sea wasps stinging him all over the place with their tentacles. He glared at Lance Richard once he was fully out of the ocean to stomp towards the male finding the crowned ruler going into the beach's ground and saw a burrowing form onto the beach he followed only to lose it once it reached the jungle. He peered through the jungle warily to find a lake down below where he saw Lance Richard swimming in the water that swam towards the shore and got onto it and walked off out of sight. 
He glared to snarl mentally "Lance Richard must have figured who I was and was trying to kill me off hence he leading me to those stinking manoid's death traps. Bloody Hades! Wait till I have a word with that idiot!"
He waved a fist in the direction Lance Richard left and went to the beach to sit on the hot burning sand ignoring the burning on his seat. He sulked with annoyance running through him as he recalled fully in his mind what he was supposed to be doing as the Guardian of Life and Death. 
Guardian picked up some sand and threw it up in the air as he snarled loudly "You Egyptia didn't do anything towards me when I killed my mother raiser but had the Meritanians manipulate me when I killed Budge. So quit being angry at me because I'm furious with myself."
He glared at the ocean as he heard a clapping noise sounding loudly only to blink his eyes finding his eyes staring at an overhead shining round light onto him making him squint. He squinted feeling some kind of restraint onto his form keeping him in a standing ramrod straight position with arms and legs spread. Guardian grunted as he felt the restraint holding his face up facing the light removed itself followed by blinking his eyes. Guardian saw with his shock Herod standing still wearing his uniform with a sinister look on his face and eyes making him annoyed. 
He glared at Herod finding the male cocked his head before hearing blasting within his mind "Admit it that you're the Guardian of Life and Death now!"
He stiffened feeling the blasting wasn't of the Meritanians but of some other mind walker as he glared with angry rising through him. He felt the blasting continued by the voice kept on blaring within his mind. Guardian willed forwards the Guardian's ability and got the voice cutting itself off. 
He spoke firmly voicing his words "I do what it takes to protect Egyptia from harm. I do what it takes to make the planet's natives know that the planet comes first than manoids second as Egyptia orders."
Guardian willed aside his Guardian's ability as he glared at Herod who he saw held up a tube device and shifted form into Daisuke to his annoyance. 
He again got the blasting within his mind "Talk on who you really are now!"
Guardian spoke firmly "I come in many names but one is Guardian of Life and Death."
He glared at Daisuke who again shifted form to the Queen to his annoyance again got the familiar voice blaring in his mind "Who's this Yevgeny Alexander Visser you appear to be as broadcasted by Mahalia's natives of you taking the King title?"
Guardian spoke still using the firm voice tone "Yevgeny Alexander Visser is the name a man of cloth named me when crowning me King of Mahalia. The natives of Mahalia aren't willing to take a female as their leader hence that broadcast to assure them that there's a King in position. I hear that Brittany nation keeps on broadcasting propaganda on retaking the Mahalia nation underneath their rule repeatedly over and over. Shouldn't you have seen that?"
He glared at the Queen who shifted form into Daisuke to his annoyance and again got that familiar voice blaring in his mind "Who's Budge that you're referring to?"
He spoke firmly "Just some drunkard with that name I murdered for crashing his car into my mother raiser's car in some highway while driving the wrong way. My mother raiser died from me manipulating her to have a peaceful death instead of a life as put down by poison. The drunkard Budge got away with the crash by judgment of one year of psychiatrist counseling something I didn't agree with and killed him as a result. His death is still considered a murder despite me calling it suicide to the cops. What's with this ridiculous interrogation anyway?"
Guardian glared at Daisuke who pocketed the tube device and flared an all black eyed look while waving a hand towards him. He found the restraints holding him in place released themselves which he fell towards the ground to land with a grunt sound onto his knees. He forced himself to stand in a fast move finding Daisuke still there with arms folded and still displaying his familiar all black eyed look to his disgust to give of that sound. 
Guardian got from Daisuke speaking his creepy voice tone "Anything else you want my Queen you want to know on Victor?"
He exhaled a breath hearing that from Daisuke to glare in response as if drawn towards a black window while folding his arms and narrowing his eyes with accusation. 
He glared at the window ignoring Daisuke to hear mentally blaring in his mind "This scene of your confession was taped. I suggested that you do what I says regarding you ruling Mahalia or else."
Guardian kept on glaring at the window in response he sensed his mind scanned from the senses blaring as he heard nothing from the mental voice he keeping his mind blank in response. He glared at the window to hear nothing from the mental voice as the mind walker quit scanning to his relief to feel sleepiness hitting him. Guardian shut his eyes again feeling himself floating in a water tank he figured he was in it as he passed out unconscious. 

Guardian came to finding he lying in bed hearing the familiar alarm clock blaring in his ear. He lurched up into a sitting position with a start to find the butler standing off his bed that removed the alarm clock's device and placed it onto the bed's table. He glared at the butler who made a Tsk sound he ignored as he got up from the bed finding he naked and not covered by the blankets. He ignored the butler to storm into the bathroom showering fully in the shower stall sensing his mind scanned in the process. 
Guardian snarled mentally "What do you want?!"
He heard in response "Egyptia has plans for you. It doesn't matter what the natives do towards you as long as you do what she orders you to do period."
He snarled despite hearing Yerra's voice "Then tells Egyptia to go shove it!"
Guardian glared at the shower wall as he forced himself out of the shower to again feel his mind still scanned to hear mentally "Ooh you're in a grouchy mood with the latest stunt Sylvia played onto you."
He frowned to mentally speak while drying himself with a towel roughly "Who is Sylvia anyway?"
He got from Tut in response "Sylvia Budge the sister of Budge the guy you killed is the Queen herself."
He heard nothing more from the Meritanians as he felt his mind quit scanned stomped out of the bathroom to glare at the butler while tossing aside the towel onto a dresser and went to his clothes lying on the bed. Guardian got the butler assisting him on how to put on the fancy suit and noticed that his bullet proof vest wasn't among the items he found on the bed making him annoyed. He once done dressed found the butler balking on giving him nourishment despite he glaring at the male.
Guardian glared to get from the butler "I'm to lead you to the eating room where you're to eat."
He didn't say a word followed the butler to the eating room to find the Queen there that was holding Nicky she giving the baby faces who cooed out laugh sounds she ignored him and his arrival. Guardian went to sit down and without another word ate and drank his food finding his appetite hearty he finding nothing wrong with the nourishment to indicate poison to him. He sat back in the chair with arms folded as he eyed the Queen he noticed was giving him a glare while noticing Nicky was gone from her arms. Guardian kept his mouth shut in response as he felt the familiar mind scanning sense blare in his mind. He kept his mind blank in response as he glared at the Queen in response to notice her eyes appearing to look blue in Egyptian style weren't really looking at him. 
Guardian spoke loudly "Something I can do for you, Mother?"
He glared at the Queen to feel the mind scanning quit to his relief as she spoke "Mother? What's with that?"
He spoke firmly what Jacinda told him regarding his creation and she carrying him including adding "It's probably a dream that I dreamed this anyway hence my bad mood at the moment."
Guardian shrugged in response to keep the glare aimed at the Queen who's eyes narrowed by the eye lids but her blue eyes didn't meet his eyes he feeling his mind not scanned to his relief. He kept glaring at the Queen who broke off the staring as he heard Nicky's loud wailing sound to notice Olga dart behind the female and appeared to be running out of sight. He heard nothing from the Queen about Olga as the female lifted up Nicky and appearing to try to sooth the baby from his loud wailing noises by giving him faces. 
Guardian felt himself disgusted looked away to glare at the wall as he heard Nicky's wailing stop followed by cooing sounds before hearing "That mood is not permitted to be aimed at me so get rid of that bad temper mood now Robert."
He spoke firmly while eyeing the Queen in response "I had a nightmare that seemed pretty bad. The dream won't go away and is making me furious from having lousy attempts to get rid of that."
He resumed glaring at the wall to hear loudly "That's an excuse and you know it Robert."
Guardian shifted to glare at the Queen to snarl loudly the stunts of Lance Richard pulled onto him getting him into manoid's death traps while making it seem like a nightmarish dream. 
He cut his words once done to resumed glaring at the wall to hear from the Queen "Robert O'Neil admit it what's gotten you upset now! Don't deny it for I can hear that voice tone of yours is twin to your sister's!"
He exhaled hearing the Queen to inhale to speak firmly "Why do I get the feeling that there's more to you than your appearance looks hmm?"
He glared at the Queen in response to feel his mind scanned abruptly to mentally yell "Get out of my mind now! I can sense you scanning me! You better be the Queen doing this mind scans and no one else!"
Guardian glared at the Queen to hear blasting in his mind "Yes it’s, I the Queen mind scanning you. You care to tell me how you managed to detect me mind scanning you hmm?"
He mentally spoke in response "Don't tell me this mind scanning bit is a part of being Queen of Mahalia she broadcasting her thoughts to the King speaking this and that."
Guardian kept the glare to hear "Actually this mind scanning is common among Mahalian natives. Mostly among people of the Samira group who pull this stunt onto people they help just to gain information on them and try to wheedle money from them for furthering their obsession with religion at the moment."
He gave off an exhale of a breath as the mind scanning quit to his relief as he inhaled to speak using his voice "What's with a servant of yours seen hiding from you?"
He clamped his mouth shut to get from the Queen verbalizing her words "Your referring to Nicola seen by you but hiding from me. She won't admit it but I suspect that she likes Danny enough to care for him. She keeps on asking me when she can play caretaker towards Danny. Yes something I can do for you Missus James?"
He found Jacinda in the room with head bowed off his right despite his confusion of the strange names used for naming people.
He wound up to hear from her "Miss Olga requests Victor outside for a game of one to one basketball. She emphasized shooting hoops whatever that is and not a physical game."
Guardian eyed the Queen in response to get from her "Simply show Victor where Olga is playing at the moment Victor, your dismissed."
He got up and followed Jacinda out of the eating room to find her leading him outside to the basketball hoop where he spotted Olga clad in little girl adult sized black dressy clothes and high heeled shoes thrusting a ball into a roped hoop from a lengthy distance. 
Guardian went to join Olga to stand next to her and speaking "Nice shooting I guess it's what it's called."
He frowned as Olga gave him a glare while still holding onto one of the balls from a rack and added "Something I should tell you?"
He got thrust the ball onto his front he held and got from Olga "Spill it Victor on that disgusted look you gave me when you laid eyes onto me playing this game."
Guardian exhaled a breath and inhaled "Your outfit is little girl like for you to be wearing for an adult."
He clamped his mouth shut forming a thin line with his lips only to get from Olga "I blame my father for always seeing me as a little girl. He has refused to see me as grown woman."
He spoke "Then why aren't you wearing anything adult like since our father isn't around?"
Guardian frowned eyeing Olga who spoke "Dad's around whether you detect him or not. He's still displaying this little girl attitude towards me regardless of what's he's doing now."
He exhaled a breath and without a word copied Olga to aim the ball towards the roped hoop to see it bounce on the metal before bouncing off of it. 
He spoke "Ugh. I don't get it why our father found this game amusing."
Guardian got thrust a ball again he gripped to eye Olga in response who spoke "This sport is the only thing Dad didn't see me as a little girl too young to play with. I played on school teams for schools I went to for education insisted by Dad to be on the team. I find that Dad always saw me as a woman whenever I play the game with whomever but a little girl doing other stuff. It's the only thing I can control and be myself with. Anything else I have to play some part as a Princess some spoiled brat as insisted by Mother to do this. I didn't care for the spoiled brat behavior anyway. I always tried to be friendly with people regardless of them being friendly with me, me being the Princess. You're lucky you grew up without the spotlight onto you anyway."
He sighed and without a word joined Olga in throwing balls into the ropey hoop finding himself klutzy with the throwing to his annoyance while his sister made every hoop throw. Guardian quit when he heard a loud wailing sound sounding of Nicky's crying to him. 
He frowned to eye Olga in response to get from her "That's Mother via intercom ordering us back into Peaches and out of playing. She pulled that noise of a baby crying onto Dad whenever he played too long. He always quitting the play to dart inside and see what the matter with that baby noise is. Hence she is pulling it onto me and now you as usual."
Guardian didn't say a word in response put the ball back onto the rack and followed Olga inside the house finding she leading to the eating room in the King's residence's quarters. He found the Queen there feeding Nicky nourishment via straw attached to a bottle along with his nose smelled food which made his stomach rumble. Guardian sat down at the table off the Queen's left finding Olga sitting off her mother's right and sipping slowly from a cup that appeared to be brown colored. He found nothing else placed in Olga's spot to indicate her taking any other nourishment as he went to take in his nourishment finding himself able to take in regular food and drink to his confusion. 
He took his time eating the food and drinking it till he heard "Out with it, Victor now."
Guardian paused from his nourishment to speak while eyeing the Queen "Nourishment I'm taking is different from my sister's."
He resumed eating and drinking to hear "Victor, your nourishment is cooked specially for you only to take. You do have nourishment allergies as tested when we threw you into those tests for that just to see what you would take in as nourishment."
Guardian looked down at the food finding it was what he cooked himself but tastier from the flavor in his mouth along with the drink was some kind of milk to him but seemed to be more smoothly swallowed by sipping instead of having to gulp it down to force himself to get it down.
He spoke once done with the eating during breaks of sipping the milk "Would this allergy have something to do with alcoholic drinks?"
He heard a cough in response to eye Olga who appeared to choke onto her nourishment by her eyes turning all red colored shocking him. 
He frowned to hear loudly "Olga, will that angry mood of yours away now!"
Guardian looked at the Queen finding her glaring at Olga he looked that appeared to resume sipping her nourishment while showing Egyptian black eyes instead of all red colored to his curiosity. 
He frowned to eye the Queen in response to get from her blasting in his mind "No you don't have an allergy towards alcoholic drinks or any dependence onto them like Olga has at the moment. She doesn't like being reminded that she survives on alcoholic drinks regardless of what it is. Her eyes will turn all into one color whenever she's furious with something which is what you should be aware of whenever she's in one of her angry hissy fits as your father called them."
He mentally spoke sensing his mind still scanned "A boy in high school picked onto me in some bullying way giving me lots of suicide themed stuff. A girl got me to go with her to some party in a state forest where there was drinking there. The bully got me to drink some kind of alcoholic drink he claimed was poisoned and left me to die with his friends going off with him. I threw up the drink actually and walked home which a Samira found me and got me into their house and called my mother raiser. It was the night she passed away in a car accident so gets out of my mind now."
Guardian glared at the Queen to find her obeying to his mind scans to hear another cough from Olga to look at her having all red eyes while showing her cup was empty of nourishment. 
He spoke after willing forwards his Guardian ability speaking firmly in his creepy voice tone "Nice eyes Olga."
Guardian got from Olga was her tossing her cup behind her back seeing it shatter onto the wall followed by her slouching further into the chair and folding her arms. 
He frowned as he heard unexpectedly "Ladies don't sit like that and you know this Olga."
He stiffened hearing his father's voice to look off his right to find Hades from the looks of him in the room with arms folded that went to stand behind the Queen while putting a hand on her shoulder. 
He saw the Queen appear to gulp by her throat motions as he eyed Hades to find the male still using his father's voice "Greetings Victor so nice to finally meet you. I see you're well acquainted with Olga and Svetlana as she's called."
Guardian gave a head bob in response while eyeing Hades warily who he saw leaned forwards and appeared to be whispering in the Queen's ear he overheard "I'm a male I got needs I need you to fulfill. I'm not taking no from you regardless of what you say. So let the staff know that I picked you for this job, so hand Olga this stinker to take care of while I get you someplace private. I'm itching."
He frowned eyeing the Queen who obeyed handing Nicky to Olga who gripped firmly in her arms and found the female leading Hades out of the room. 
Guardian frown eyeing Olga in response who spoke "Dad drilled into everyone working here including me and my mother what Hades wants from us he gets it period."
He spoke "I get it your words. What has Hades gotten from you if it's not too bad to talk about it?"
He frowned eyeing Olga who appeared to rock Nicky in a gentle move in her arms before speaking he hearing her using a lower voice tone "Mostly games of basketball against my father which usually backfires on the both of them. They play pretty physical enough to want to get nourishment. Hades habitually feeds onto a staff member while Dad hits the kitchen to gulp down something available which can be anything. Mother having to use the baby cry intercom is a way of getting Dad to quit the game with Hades or whoever just to get him inside the house to see what's going on. It's a trick that has worked onto him and myself as well as always."
Guardian spoke in a low voice tone finding Olga appearing to hear him fine "Sorry for bringing this up but did you really carry an offspring or was that a joke?"
He got Olga's red eyes in response followed by Nicky giving off a loud wailing sound making him grimace. He grimaced fully as Nicky quit his wailing once Olga quit her red eyed look and appeared to be making faces towards the baby. 
He frowned further as Olga after awhile of face making spoke "The offspring carrying was something I thought would make Dad see me as an adult in his eyes. He kept on treating me the same old habit even while I was carrying despite I bed ridden for awhile. The offspring reportedly sucked me from within actually to make me crave nourishment a lot. I was craving all sorts of nourishment which I took in for the first time but my body wasn't absorbing it. It was all going to the offspring actually."
Guardian spoke "I saw our sister whatever name she's referred carrying-"
He was interrupted "Mother refers her as Talia actually and she was carrying Nicky?"
He spoke "Yes I saw her but she appeared to have an easier time with her carrying status. She was active but avoided stairs. I heard from her mother raiser that she had problems with the offspring settling on her bladder enough to expel a lot."
Guardian heard snickering from Olga in response to see her laughing which he felt the Guardian ability in control and not willed away sighed and willed it aside while forming a glare with his Egyptian blue eyes. 
He glared at Olga who quit the laughing before adding "Sorry you look funny with that eyed look actually. Anyway during near the end of my carrying status I was bed ridden and stayed in bed a lot. I'm surprised that Talia had an easier time carrying than I did. I don't get it why she seemed to carry better than I did with my own son. That despite Nicky was tested and habitually likes to drink blood as his nourishment. He has refused other nourishment drinks given to him by spitting out the bottle or straw thrust into his mouth he refusing to take a sip of the nourishment in it."
He sighed softly and heard from Olga after a lengthy pause of talking "That reminds me it's about time I go put Nicky down for a nap. Since Mother is busy I'm expected to take care of him and his needs. Hades is always physical whenever he wants something done like those games. He's like a machine keeps on doing this physical act no matter what it is for too much time till he gets bored or too hungry to bother doing it anymore and then does something else."
Guardian exhaled a breath and without a word followed Olga out of the eating room to find her going to a bedroom door to stick her ear onto it while giving a head bob and then walking towards an open doorway he followed. He found Olga halted the walk to give him a red eyed glare and a hand wave towards him in a shooing gesture. He sighed and walked away out of the King's residence quarters to find his familiar teenaged bedroom was outside the door leading to the hallway to the area. 
He went to the door to feel a hand tapping him on the shoulder along with hearing "You have duties as King that requires daily meetings in the office along with public outings to the public to show that Mahalia is safe from Brittany nation's machinations."
He sighed softly hearing the firmness of the voice he figured belonged to a bodyguard and without a word went to the office to get inside finding the staff already inside but this time a different male was holding the General position of Herod. He went inside the office hearing the doors shut behind him and went to sit down at the King's chair at the desk.
Guardian spoke loudly in a loud firm voice "Enlighten me on your reports now."
He formed a glare while folding his arms and eyed each staff member to find them indicating towards the new General by their behavior. 
He spoke "Pleased to meet you General. For the record what name you wish to be referred as?"
He eyed the General to hear a loud ahem sound in the room to get from the male "For respects the name as referred is always Herod for the military's leader for Mahalia."
Guardian spoke sounding firm "My father wanted me not to be raised as a spoiled brat who got everything what they wanted. Instead I was taught to learn like a normal person who didn't know anything about my heritage of being the King's son including what the King titled duties involved. I was home schooled for most of my life tutored by various tutors while raised by a midwife. The midwife in question traveled all over Mahalia hence I unable to attend school for any learning to be done. I went to a high school after my mother raiser's light was extinguished once I was at the declared age of seventeen. She didn't celebrate birthdays with me anyway. She always uses various all over the place dates to have me declared an age. Anyway I went to a high school and once I was at the declared age of nineteen I was kicked out using my age as reason why I should be out of school. I worked so far three physical jobs, involving factory work, a doorman of a building, and being a bouncer of a female only bar-"
He heard ahem noise interrupting him which he added once the voice quit "Report on what I should know now."
He formed a glare to get another ahem noise which he spoke recalling his crowning ceremony "What is the public's reaction towards me being their King as in crowning and surviving some kind of weird helicopter crash?" 
Guardian heard from the new Herod he assumed he'll refer him "Actually the public has managed to get brave enough to seek out the air travel route again. You seen surviving the helicopter crash has given them the courage to travel via airway route. Their reaction to your crowning was mostly of relief. They were heard commenting of you having some resemblance to the Queen of having twin looks via facial appearance."
He shifted to glare at Herod to get from the General speaking "Your facial appearance after meeting you is twin to the Queen which is what the public is commenting about. Their claiming that a surrogate was used to carry you after the Queen reportedly had a miscarriage carrying the second daughter fathered by someone else."
He kept his mouth shut in response to continue on glaring at Herod who appeared to gulp before adding "Alright I admit it that your father had your face and body form given prosthetics that were realistically put onto you after you had your arm operation to fix your injury."
Guardian kept the glare as Herod continued talking "Someone a police officer unknown to this day found out about the disguise trick managed to get the police at where your living to spy onto you repeatedly all over. They even rigged your residences and your jobs you were working with recording devices to record you. Those prosthetics were removed once your father was declared dead in a plane crash."
Guardian kept the glare as Herod quit talking while hearing another ahem sound which he spoke firmly "What's Brittany nation's reaction to me being declared King?"
He resumed glaring at each staff member to hear from the secretary "Still up to their retake attempts at the moment. Their still broadcasting propaganda on retaking Mahalia as usual but this time using a recording of the helicopter crash altered to claim your light extinguished. The public doesn’t believe that propaganda anyway. It appears you walking out of the helicopter crash alive got spread by word of mouth which that news is all over Mahalia by that fashion."
Guardian didn't say a word in response kept the glare on his face while eyeing each staff member as he heard another ahem sound. 
He spoke "What's the status of finding me a female to marry that isn't of Brittany nation?"
He glared to hear from Herod "Actually this Melinda Long you spoke of isn't a student at the school you attended. She's a grandmother like teacher whose light is already extinguished."
Guardian groaned softly to rub a hand over his eyes while bowing his head to frown as he heard "You will remember who this female you friend at Finely Town high school and name included too."
He frowned as he saw clearly in his mind a see through wall hit by a wall of rocks making him confused to think "Walls."
Guardian stiffened as the see through wall went down followed by the wall of rocks he again finding himself floating in his water tank. He got images fully in his mind he groaned loudly from while feeling himself falling asleep and blinked his eyes. Guardian blinked his eyes finding himself back in the office and not in the water tank.
He spoke in a groaning tone after fully recalling who the female was "Her name was Chandra Lang as called by the teachers but she referred herself as Melinda Long to me and students. It's no joke that the students nicknamed her melon. It's no joke that she refused to date me despite friends with me. The principal got a hold of me just prior to kick out of school and used some Compeller voice tone to forget Chandra and only refer her as Melinda. I blame him for using that Compeller ability to kick me out of school. That's attending school one day and barred from entering by the principal who used some Compeller ability onto me to forget going back to school. He used the excuse of me being age nineteen to me as a reason why I shouldn't be in school. I wound up kicked out as a result and registration for a diploma rejected."
He clamped his mouth shut with a frown forming on his face to hear "Tell me more of this Chandra Lang now."
Guardian removed his hand to stare at Herod the speaker who appeared to gulp. 
He spoke "Alright what I said regarding this Melinda Long for the first time is true on what's this Chandra Lang looks like and wears her clothes while attending the school."
He clamped his mouth shut to frown to eye Herod who spoke "Any particular reason why the principal would kick you out of his school?"
Guardian heard in response "You will state the reason why you were kicked out of high school now."
Guardian frowned hearing the Compeller's voice spoke firmly as he recalled the reason why "Someone accused me of forcing mating onto a female and getting her carrying. It was all over the school with that rumor of some male doing that deed. The student some popular female wound up pointed as the one carrying and she proved that. I'm not even sure why but she fingered me as the one who got her carrying despite I wasn't responsible. This female student had a father who paid the school high amounts hence the principal doing what her father said having me kicked out as a result."
He clamped his mouth shut to form a thin line with his mouth while eyeing Herod who appeared to gulp and then heard a baby crying noise making him confused. 
He frowned as Herod spoke "Meeting's over now as stated by the alarm clock making that noise. Excuse me."
He saw Herod fade from view which he got up and without a word walked out of the office sensing bodyguards following him. 
Guardian went to his room only to get a hand tapping his shoulder and heard "Go to the eating room and see if the Queen is done with her business with Hades."
Guardian frowned but obeyed to the guard's comment and found the Queen seated there with Hades giving her a back rub by the looks of it. He frowned but went to sit down next to the Queen while keeping his mouth shut. He noticed the Queen looked tired to him whose eyes kept on blinking shut repeatedly. He frowned eyeing the Queen to see her put her arms onto the table followed by putting her head onto it and appeared to be sleeping to him. Hades he saw continued on the back rub rubbing the Queen's back in a gentle move before quitting fold his arms and looking at him while giving off a faint growl sound. 
Guardian frowned inwardly as he spoke in a low tone "Shouldn't she be in bed asleep instead of at the table?"
He got from Hades "Admit it Victor on why you were really kicked out of high school now."
He exhaled a breath and inhaled to speak as if compelled words coming out of his mouth "I was home schooled actually. I attended high school and scored high on their tests. The principal used some excuse of some female carrying as reason why I should be kicked out. Turns out that the school didn't want parents to think that home schooling their kids then later putting their offspring into school for a diploma would work like it was with me."
He clamped his mouth shut to form a thin line while eyeing Hades who spoke "That's not the reason and you know it, Victor."
Guardian groaned softly hearing the accusation in Hades' voice tone spoke firmly "That's my reason and I'm sticking with it period."
He glared at Hades that spoke "Yevgeny Alexander Visser."
Guardian heard Hades' firm voice spoke as if compelled "I was accused of causing a female to end her own light extinguished on an account of mating with her. She found the mating not acceptable ended her own light. What's with this interrogation anyway?"
He glared at Hades with his eyes narrowed to get from the male speaking "Interrogation? It's nothing but the truth actually. So admit it why you couldn't get a diploma hmm?"
He spoke firmly "I was working some factory job during the day while attending college for getting my diploma during the night. The college threw this five class requirement to get a high school diploma to me. I kept hearing that it took only one class to get a diploma and other students flaunting that fact despite the college balking on awarding me one. I already took three of those classes. One female wound up claiming that she was forced into a mating ritual in her car by some male is when the college quit having night classes. I managed to save up a great deal of money to get back into college once I was laid off from my factory job. Thanks to some departed cop I had to blow that money onto caring for a pet some bat cat hybrid I wound up giving up the vet claiming some law after some spider infestation happened to the residence I was living. I went to live with my sister not Olga but another sister elsewhere dubbing herself Olivia. It was Olivia who sort of balked on having me attend any local community colleges for getting my diploma. I kept getting that balking done repeatedly by her. Also I didn't live long enough in various states to get back into another community college to get my diploma as required for college students to do. They have to live into states long enough to gain entry into college other than paying a huge monetary price tag for that. I wasn't able to earn enough money for this anyway."
He glared at Hades quitting his talk to hear from the male "Something you want to admit hmm?"
Guardian frowned to get fully in his mind a memory. 
He saw himself asking a female student of the college he went to at night time "Can I have a ride home from you? I don't like the sound of this weather anyway."
He recalled got from her he recalling her name was Marissa "Certainly just point out the route to your address."
Guardian got into her car and pointed out his home route that led to his residence which on arrival in the parking lot underneath a stormy sky he and Marissa kissed on the lips. He shut his eyes groaning softly as he recalled what happened next was Marissa got a hold of his sensitive part and got himself inside her. He sigh cutting off his groaning to recall Marissa was his first he mated with despite sensing he wasn't her first after he got inside her. He exhaled a breath to recall he managed to spill himself inside Marissa who once he was done got him out of the car. Guardian recalled smiling a smirk before going inside his residence to sleep before the alarm went off signaling a factory work day. 
He heard from Hades finding the male next to him instead of behind the Queen "You reek of female's mating scent from the smell of you."
He sighed softly to speak firmly "I was hugged by a female pointed out to be my mother actually. I never mated with her anyway."
Guardian glared at Hades who leaned forwards thrusting his black face with yellow orbs seen into his face and appeared to be sniffing him from the sniffing sounds made from the male. 
It made him annoyed enough to speak "Your sniffing behavior is making me think you're suspicious of something."
He glared at Hades who quit the sniffing to his relief he heard from the male finding him behind the Queen this time "Actually you reek of her as the Queen told me."
He spoke firmly "I'm an offspring of hers via implantation done onto another female who carried me actually."
Guardian folded his arms to hear from Hades "Olga quit lurking in the doorway and go sit down but at least sit down ladylike now."
He found Olga in the room obeying Hades' order to sit down with arms folded and gave him a glare with red eyes seen.
Guardian spoke "Out with it Olga on what your furious about."
He got from Olga in response "You confirmed what Mother admitted she got from your mother carrying you. I didn't believe it at first but now I do."
He sighed softly but didn't comment a response as Hades he saw used some super speed to get next to Olga and was sniffing her she ignoring the male doing it. Guardian frowned as Hades quit his sniffing to get back behind the Queen using super speed method.
He heard "Well Olga what do you have to say for smelling like one of the guards hmm?"
He groaned softly while eyeing Olga who spoke still displaying her red eyed look "I admit it I'm crazy to want another offspring via mating way hence I targeting the guards with that on my mind. Excuse me while I go attend to Nicky. I left him sleeping in a crib."
Guardian eyed Olga who got up a fast move only to get blocked by Hades who placed a hand on her shoulder and heard from the male "I expect you to dress better than what you're dressing in. I don't want to see you dressed like this again."
Guardian sighed softly as Olga without a word got Hades' hand off her shoulder and stomped out of the room her hearing the door slamming shut with a bang sound. He eyed Hades in response to find the male picking up the Queen who remained sleeping and slung her over his shoulder before walking out of the room hearing the door bang shut. Guardian got up from the chair only to see a female wearing a cook uniform came into the room carrying a tray that formed a nervous expression on her face. He sighed and sat down with a frown while eyeing the female who placed the tray in front of him he finding it only contained his own nourishment and nothing for Olga or the Queen. He sighed and ate the food and drank the drink finding the cook watching him with a narrowed eyed glare on her face with arms folded. Guardian forced himself to take his time eating and drinking the nourishment making sure he consumed it all before getting up to hear a throat clearing noise from the cook. 
He spoke "Thanks for the meal miss."
Guardian got nothing from the cook only to see her pick up the tray and without a word entered the kitchen he assumed was where she went with the door slamming shut with a bang sound. 
He groaned softly without a word left the eating room to meet a bodyguard on the way who spoke "Meeting in the office now."
He obeyed to go to the office to again find the staff members there with the new Herod. 
Guardian went to sit down in the King's chair and folded his arms while speaking firmly "'Report."
Guardian heard from Herod "Actually same old news as usual. Just the usual propaganda by Brittany but this times their blaring some wedding ceremony with your look alike to a reported princess. This princess isn't a part of the Brittany's royal family but some actress according to spies paid to go around as a member of the Monarchy said to ensnare you into a marriage trap hence their propaganda at the moment."
Guardian groaned softly to rub a hand on his forehead as he spoke while removing the hand "What's the public's reaction to that actually?"
He eyed Herod to hear loudly "Actually the public's reaction is to deny that propaganda's broadcasting by claiming their own daughters would be worthy of being your wife. Hence there's a crowd of females gathered outside the gates with pick me signs included."
He sighed softly to frown eyeing the secretary the speaker who looked down at her computer pad as he heard another ahem noise. 
He resumed looking at Herod with a glare who spoke "The Eli is still running on who this Chandra Lang is. She has so far indicated her student of the high school you went to. She's still running on information on this Chandra Lang at the moment but will let us know once the information is fully gathered actually."
Guardian gave off a Humph sound before hearing Herod add "There's conflicting reports by the Eli reporting that this Chandra Lang while living in Mahalia and wasn't a native of this nation but actually a Republic native by alias of her family arriving to Mahalia with a Republic ID when signing up for citizenship."
He sighed softly while eyeing Herod who cocked his head forming a faraway expression on his face he figured was wearing a listening device in his ear. 
He frown eyeing Herod who spoke "Eli is reporting the ID that Chandra Lang's father used when registering for Visa here in Mahalia was a Brittany name of McNeil McFarland despite speaking with a Republic accent. He later used another name when signing up for citizenship which is Song Lang then some Orient like name. His daughter on registration to get a Visa was named Brittany McFarland. Her name was later changed to Chandra Lang as her citizenship name while using the ID of Melinda Long at the public schools she attended. The Eli is currently running at the moment on where her residence is at the moment."
Guardian eyed the secretary as if drawn to see her eyes were shut with a nervous expression on her face making him confused to what she was thinking. He frowned to eye the secretary to notice that she was older than his age appearing to be the Queen's age as she opened her eyes and did a double take look to notice him staring at her. 
He stared at her as she blurted loudly "Alright I know who that Chandra Lang is actually!"
Guardian frowned eyeing her as Herod was heard "Eli says that Chandra Lang's Mother is working as secretary for the King at the moment so admit this now!"
He formed a glare while eyeing the secretary who spoke in response while glaring at Herod "Chandra Lang is my daughter actually but she has a male offspring she gave the name of Robert. She claimed some male fathered her son through a one night stand in her car after giving him a ride to his residence."
Guardian stiffened of shock hearing that to keep the expression off his face while forming a thin line with his mouth he eyeing secretary who looked at him he spoke in response "Marissa was the name of the female who I had my first time."
He clamped his mouth shut to see the secretary's eyes widen of shock who spoke firmly "Spill it Your Majesty on what this Marissa looked like you had your first time with now."
He sighed and spoke the description fully including adding "When I mated with her I sensed I wasn't her first knowing what my mother raiser told me over the years of helping females give birth to offsprings. Mostly talk involving the offsprings' creation actually."
He formed a glare while eyeing secretary who placed down the computer pad and pulled out a cell phone she heard dialing numbers then speaking onto it fully "Hello daughter it's your mother. I found the Guardian at the residence working there."
He heard a pause making him confused to the name of Guardian used. 
It was followed by secretary adding "Yes I ID him from your description after giving him various worded questions which he proved to be the one actually. I didn't tell him that you were looking for him actually."
He stiffened as the secretary paused then added "Yes I'll make sure that there's clearance for you to enter the residence with Robert. So go now."
He eyed secretary who shut the cell phone by putting it away in her pocket and addressing him "My daughter is on the way with Robert. She's willing to submit her son to a DNA test to prove that he's yours actually. I warn you that Robert has been kept isolated out of the public eye his facial appearance is twin to Nikolai's from the looks of him. His facial appearance appears to have inherited from you as his father actually."
He frowned to give a head bob in response to hear from Herod loudly "Eli says-"
Herod he heard was interrupted "Enough of that stinking computer whining on who this Chandra Lang is actually."
He exhaled a breath hearing Hades' voice to find Hades in the room with arms folded he not sure of how the male got into the room he figuring it involved some super speed method. 
Guardian eyed Hades who spoke while looking at him "Admit it Guardian on how many females you mated with after the moment your mother raiser's light was extinguished hmm?"
Guardian eyed Herod as if drawn to find the male giving him a golden eyed glare with arms folded hands' seen fisted. 
He spoke as if compelled words coming out of his mouth shocking him "I was all over the place mating with various females around my age actually which I was their first time. After the mating was done they would dump me to go have a relationship with some other male. I did used protection some sort of medicine in my drinks to prevent offsprings from forming each time I mated with a female despite her claiming of using some medical status to keep from carrying. My mother raiser a midwife taught me various tricks on taking medicine for preventing offsprings from forming in hidden forms to use despite the female thinking she could get an offspring from me."
He glared at Hades who spoke "And what your not was admitting hmm?"
He spoke in response in a firm voice tone "I didn't take the medicine when I mated with a female in her car. I wanted to know what it was like to get an offspring created in the process. Besides that medicine prevented me from doing any seedling as called inside females. I couldn't feel anything from that medicinal use which made me feel numb down there as a result. So I didn't take it this time when I mated with a female in her car just to know what its like to feel actually is. Hence I am referring her as my first."
Guardian clamped his mouth shut while eyeing Hades to get from the male "What else you’re not admitting? I hear that edge in your voice tone actually."
He spoke firmly he feeling confused to what he was saying "We shared a cigarette which I quit that habit once I was hospitalized for my arm injury. Also Marissa and I got into a discussion on mating once arriving to the parking lot of my residence. She admitting some male forced her into a mating ritual hence she nervous about males and mating how painfully numb it was. I wound up sweet talking her into using me to get over her fear of the mating ritual which we did it in the car. She took the lead in the mating ritual which I let her have her own way with me all over the place. I kept my hands to myself till she was done."
He clamped his mouth shut while giving Hades a glare who spoke "What you’re not admitting hmm?"
He eyed secretary to see her giving him a narrowed eyed glare of accusation in her eyes which he recalled what happened after Marissa touched him all over not sparing his sensitive part but refraining from doing the mating ritual to him. 
Guardian spoke firmly while eyeing secretary "I got her into a mating ritual despite she not agreeing with it."
He clamped his mouth shut while leaning back in the chair and folded his arms while continuing to eye secretary who kept her mouth shut.
He heard a voice speak "What does the Eli say regarding this Guard Beers hmm?"
Guardian eyed Herod he feeling the voice sounded oddly Columbian and not of a Mahalia native. 
He kept on eyeing Herod to find the male still giving him a golden eyed glare who spoke "That police files on Guard Beers say that he murdered his mother raiser in a car accident. Some mercy killing and then later murdered the driver some drunkard for causing the car crash and called the murder a suicide when its not. There's some kind of homing beacon that pinpointed him at the site of the drunkard's murder before winking out and resuming function at his own residence. Cops went to check on this winking out status and found the drunkard's body underwater in a lake held by cement block after they gave that lake a through search. Autopsy says that the drunkard's light was extinguished by neck snapping and not by drowning hence they calling it a murder and not buying the story of suicide said to them."
Guardian grimaced fully on his face hearing the voice sounded feminine computer like in electronic tones. He frown feeling himself confused to why Herod was using that computer voice.
He continued to frown while eyeing Herod who kept the glare and continued speaking still using the voice "That the daughter of the secretary Marissa claimed that she was raped by a male pointed out to be Guard Beers in her car with no evidence to back up her claim. Instead she wound up carrying an offspring a male that had DNA test done recently after birthing him pointing out him as the father."
He groaned softly to grimace again while eyeing Herod who added "Guard Beers actual name of Robert O’Neil according to the police redeemed himself by saving the lives of a warship's workers by warning them of an approaching spinner storm. He was reportedly goofing off smoking a cigarette outside instead of doing work and was no where to be found when pestered to do work by the Captain. This goofing off status was habitually done by Robert found outside in various locations smoking anything other than just cigarettes. He seemed to have some habit of smoking drugs some illegal including reeking of them once he came inside to do work."
Guardian groaned softly recalling it was what Herod said fully in his mind as the General kept on glaring at him.
He spoke firmly "I saw the spinner storm form right in the parking lot which I ran inside and pulled the alarm for such storms. I managed to get to the storm shelter with everyone else only to find out that the President's son wasn't there. The President in the shelter ordered me to find his son and bring him safely or be fired and not have a job in West Allied state. I left the storm shelter intending to hide in the President's office staff facility's bathroom instead of finding the son. I found the son hiding in a stall in there on a coincidence. He was really clingy onto me using me as some kind of shield from the roof falling apart from the spinner storming outside. I broke my left arm from one of the debris hitting the area hence I have a scar. Anyway the spinner storm got into the bathroom which we both ran to the sinks to grab onto the faucets that they were still clinging to the wall. I got there first which the son grabbed my leg at the last minute and kept an ironclad hold onto the area despite me holding onto a sink faucet with one hand. I'm not even sure of what else happened next is that the spinner storm went by and the building suffered too much damage to be rebuilt which it was torn down. As for the President I was later fired and given a small pension and used the excuse of saving his son's life as reason why I shouldn't work for him anymore."
He clamped his mouth shut while eyeing Herod who kept the glare to hear from the General sounding of a male voice "And what about the drugs Robert took in his system hmm?"
He spoke voice sounding like feminine and electronic to his confusion "He wound up hospitalized for an arm injury that broke a bone and nerves in his arm that required rehabilitation. Robert used to favor his left hand when it came for writing. But now he's stuck using his right hand. His left hand regarding therapy is still balking on being used for that. The hospital had Robert withdrawn from his habit of drugs and drinking like an alcoholic fully. He hasn't had a cigarette or a drink in a long time."
Guardian found himself speaking sounding of he "I've been keeping myself clean and sober actually."
He eyed Herod in response who spoke sounding male to him instead of feminine electronic "And? What the reason for the drugged habit and drinking in the first place and the reason why Robert is completely off it?"
Guardian spoke sounding like himself "The drugs and drinking was trying to fit in with the crowd at the high school an addiction habit I kept up till I was hospitalized. It was a female who made her presence known to me of who my father was after I woke up to discover prosthetics put onto my form I didn't accept at first. Wanda told me of my father being the leader and told me I had to quit the drinking and drugged addiction habits period in case I could take over the title. I kept up the clean and sober status as a result despite Wanda smoking cigarettes in front of me repeatedly from time to time. I managed to refrain from smoking cigarettes after Wanda smoked them in front of me. I even refrained from asking Wanda for one of her cigarettes to smoke despite tempted."
Guardian clamped his mouth shut while forming a grimace on his face from what he said.
He eyed Herod who spoke "Well the Eli confirms what she says according to police files onto him. The President himself was responsible for those prosthetics being ordered put onto Robert just to hide him from the public. The prosthetics at first focused onto his entire body but during his healing periods from his arm injury is when they were removed one at a time but left on his face till Wanda got a hold of him and got him to a medical facility to get him tested fully."
Guardian groaned softly while rubbing a hand on his forehead as he heard a door rapping sound loudly in a code of four knocks to hear the door opening followed by "Ma that's him the one who fathered my son I have with me."
He looked up to spot a female around his age holding onto a young male child on her hip as he saw her looking at the secretary who got up and went to her appearing to be whispering in her ear. 
He overheard abruptly "Your Majesty, this is Guard Beers aka Victor aka Yevgeny Alexander Visser and what's left of him. You sure you want to do this procedure in question?"
He frowned to form a frown on his face at what he overheard. Guardian wound up eyeing the younger female he recalled was named Marissa that formed a glare before thrusting the boy child onto secretary her mother and marched up towards him he stood keeping his arms to the side in response. He eyed Marissa who slapped him on the cheek making him grimace from the pain inwardly while eyeing her in the blue eyes finding her height reached the tip of his nose. 
He eyed her warily as she spoke while holding up a hand towards him "The name is Marissa. Pleased to meet you Mister O'Neil or should I say Robert."
He took Marissa's hand and gently kissed it with his lips to get her glaring at him which he spoke after removing the hand "Excuse me I have to apologize for my rude behavior towards you. I admit it to the staff that I sort of used force to mate with you that resulted in the boy child you're seen with."
He clamped his mouth shut in response to frown eyeing Marissa who spoke "The boy child is dubbed American his looks of a Columbian by my family. I refer him as Collin officially as his nickname which his official name is American Collin York. I figured this time it'll be Robert O'Neil since you're the heir at the moment."
He nodded his head in response as Marissa removed her hand from his hand's grip and walked away. 
He followed to secretary holding the child who held up both arms while speaking "Dada."
Guardian didn't comment a response took the child from secretary and held him. 
He frowned seeing Collin's eyes turn all black colored to hear blared in his mind "My name is Robert not Collin."
Guardian frowned hearing that looked at Marissa who appeared to not notice instead was standing next to him with a hint of a smile on her face. 
He mentally thought to himself as Collin kept blaring his comment over and over mentally "Robert? I thought your name was Collin like your Mother called you?"
Guardian eyed Collin who kept blaring the comment sounding like a Meritanian sounding within his mind making him blurt loudly "My name is Robert not Collin."
Guardian frowned as his eyesight became blurry with greens in it along with liquid showing in view as he felt something like a tube cylinder over taking everything all around him making him confused. He felt the walls of the cylinder were surrounding his body while he was floating inside it suspended by the liquid. Guardian felt something like an oxygen mask covering his mouth making him confused to why he was contained to dream of something realistic. He felt confusion hitting him blinked his eyes from a glare of a shining sunlight blaring onto his eyes.
He heard a muffled "He's awake!"
It sounded of Meg language of Megiddo to him. 
Guardian continued to hear muffled "Put the sleepers in now! He's awake now! We have our orders regarding him now!"
He heard a roaring sound within his mind along with seeing a familiar see through wall that looked different from his Guardian of Life and Death wall instead gave him a creepy feeling like he knew it somewhere. He frowned as he felt sleepiness hitting him shut his eyes and passed out unconscious.

Part Six: Guardian

Guardian dreamed of memories involving Robert O'Neil himself making him seem to be the male despite feeling like he was someone else originally. 
He continued to dream the memories in his mind in a looping pattern till he mentally spoke "Stop it now! Stop this joke Egyptia! Just show what my purpose is actually!"
Guardian got fully in his mind an image of the ocean followed by two black plants he recognized as the Meritanians rising unfurling their petals. 
He heard "I'm Yerra a Meritanian speaking to you on what I've heard from you. The Guardian of Life and Death is actually an entity being that possessed males to function on protecting Egyptia from harm. Hence your confusion on whom you are actually."
He stiffened as Yerra continued speaking "Your confused due to the Guardian ability taking control of you and controlling you to point that you actually think yourself as this entity like a person when its not. It's just an entity actually. Sorry you're confused on this."
Guardian mentally spoke in response "Yerra kindly explain why I have memories of living on Mahalia as someone else dubbed Guardian?"
He frowned to hear from Yerra in response "The memories of the previous Guardian title holder gets passed down whoever is called to do that job in question. Hence you recall a life living on Mahalia when you received the memories of a previous title holder actually."
He spoke mentally in response "Do I remember what happened to my previous title holder?"
He got from Yerra "The Guardian entity of life and death got itself out of your previous title holder once it was obvious he wasn't able to do the job. Don't worry about him. He's still alive but this time doing a job what Egyptia's natives have called him to do this time. He's fine at the moment but has no memory of being the Guardian of Life and Death along with the knowledge of whoever knew him as that having the information erased from their minds. The entity's presence leaving a male always erases information from the title holder including whoever around the entity with knowledge of this out of their minds so they don't know of this actually. Sorry you're confused on this so sleep now."
Guardian obeyed to sleep.

Guardian came to finding himself still contained in a tube with his familiar oxygen mask covering his mouth. 
He heard the familiar voice speaking their familiar line making him yell despite muffled talk "What's going on?!"
Guardian felt sleepiness hitting him in response came to finding he lying on a bed wearing a hospital gown on his form while chained. He felt annoyance take hold to open his eyes to look around the room discovering it appeared to be a medical bay involving a Mahalia's warship to him. He looked around feeling himself confused to find Megs getting into view giving off soft groaning noises while appearing to be pawing him on the arms and looking upset to him. 
He stiffened when he heard from them "Alright? Alright?"
Guardian found the word repeated to open his mouth speaking "Alright."
He felt himself annoyed with what he spoken as the Megs got him freed from the chains he noticing his skin was scaly and green colored to hear from them "Alright we Megs want to do this."
Guardian frowned as the Megs in response opened their mouths showing fangs and began biting him all over the bare skin he finding pain and grunting loudly from it as if compelled to find himself passing out unconscious.

Guardian came to once again the tube with the oxygen mask covering his mouth and nose. 
He spoke loudly despite muffled talk "What's going on?!"
Guardian heard in response "Go to sleep!"
He stiffened hearing the familiar voice to yell "Why are you having me asleep instead of being awake?!"
He got from the voice in response "Sleep!"
Guardian felt sleepiness hitting him mentally spoke "Shield."
He found the shield command refused to work as the sleepiness persisted followed by passing out unconscious to come once again in the tube with the familiar oxygen mask still covering his mouth and nose. 
Guardian again heard the familiar voice's sleep command to yell loudly "Give me one good reason why I should be sleeping! I don't want to sleep any more!"
He formed a glare with his eyes narrowed to hear "You should sleep and quit asking ridiculous questions."
He stiffened for the voice reminded him of Eli's but didn't seem to be like that machine to him.
He spoke in response "What's so special about containing me into this tube for me to sleep?"
He formed a glare with his eyes to get from the voice in response "Just sleep! You need it to heal! You're sick with a medical ailment that sleeping it off will heal you! So sleep now!"
Guardian found himself passing out unconscious to dream of the Queen of Mahalia getting into a car vehicle while having a smirk on her face.
He hearing from her "Mahalia is mine forever."
He frowned as he eyed the vehicle warily to find it exploding in fireball making him stiffened. Guardian continued to dream of the former Queen he recalled was actually named Svetlana brought out of the car explosion her body just burnt bones and then dumped into the ocean which gonoids ate the bones. 
He kept on dreaming of Daisuke taking the King's crown with Olivia as Queen speaking "Olga I'm ordering you to raise Nicky as he's referred as.”
Guardian found Olga not protesting to Daisuke's order while in the King's office instead took Nicky and walked out of the room. He eyed Olivia standing silently in the room rub a hand over an area on her body he figured that she was pregnant again. He didn't say a word as he came to finding himself back into the tube hearing Eli's voice order him to sleep again which he passed out unconscious.

Guardian came to hearing sinister laughter including a voice of a Compeller sounding Eli's voice tone to him. It made him confused as he again fell unconscious while contained in the tube. He came to feeling himself lying on a bed cold all over and shivering. He frowned as he clung to the blanket trying to warm he up. Guardian frowned as images filled into his mind. He saw an underwater vessel a submarine as called going through the ocean with the maelstrom waves above it in an angry manner. He saw an object a round cylinder with a fire at the end that burned everything he seeing it hit the submarine via one end. He saw an explosion hit the submarine followed by it appearing to be sinking further down into the ocean. Guardian frowned seeing the submarine hit an underwater cliff and remained lying on it still without movement. He continued to see as if compelled to find a boat drifting in calm seas he focused onto its bottom to see if open into two parts and made a sucking movement into the ocean's water. Guardian continued to watch as the submarine was sucked up from the cliff into the boat's bottom like something attracting it. He frowned as the ship moved into the ocean still carrying the submarine till it reached the underwater kingdom of the Knivers to drop the submarine onto the area stirring up the gonoids. Guardian felt confusion hitting him as he saw the Knivers cover the submarine followed by the boat going away out of sight. He again got the familiar sinister laughter to his confusion. 
Guardian spoke in response "What's going on?"
He heard in response "Nothing just sleeps."
Guardian frowned for the voice sounded of Eli's to him but had a sinister laughter like tone to him. It made him confused for a lengthy time period till he focused onto the Knivers as if drawn in his mind. He saw Megs diving from a boat appearing to be a warship and swimming underwater towards the submarine that was covered by Knivers. He found the Megs had no problems getting the Knivers to remove themselves off the submarine by poking them with their clawed hands. He continued to see as the Megs entered the submarine via entrance on its side appearing to be the area where the cylinder's object burst a hole in. He frowned as he saw an eyesight view of a male contained in a tube he saw with shock was himself he confused to see. Guardian frowned as he saw Megs get himself out of the tube by punching the tube's walls that let in water and took him out. He saw himself appear to look thinly muscular with veins seen in red lines all over his form. Guardian heard nothing from the sinister laughter in response found the Megs hauling himself out and getting him to the warship where he was hoist onto it via ropes tied around him. Guardian frowned as he felt himself warm abruptly from the blanket sighed softly. He heard breathing sounds that sounded raspy to him and seemed like someone was having trouble breathing to him. He kept hearing the breather coming closer and closer to him whom he jerked open his eyes to find himself lying on his back and looked off his left as if drawn. He found the breather was a skeleton in a fire burned color to him. He frowned as the skeleton stared at him with Egyptian black eyes while still rasping its breathing. 
Guardian eyed the skeleton warily to find he speaking "Mother, Your Majesty."
He held up a hand that was showing red lines of veins popping towards the skeleton he finding it backed up and darted out of sight. He heard the familiar sinister laughter sound again to focus onto the sound for it reminded him of a Compeller's voice speaking compelling commands to him. He felt annoyance take hold as he found darkness surrounding his eyesight to blink his eyes once light shined in them. Guardian looked as if drawn to find he standing on a cliff with a lighted lighthouse lighting up the darkness surrounding him. He found ocean waves hitting the grounded area where he was. Guardian frowned as he felt a hand touching his shoulder off his right. He looked to find the Queen of Mahalia Svetlana he assumed was her name floating next to him. He found her having wings of a bat with body covered in a red robe while wearing a bottle like crown on her head and having no hair seen from the area. Guardian frowned as Svetlana faded from view followed by a hand grabbing his left shoulder he looked to find her again there while waving a finger in his direction. He didn't say a word as Svetlana forced his eyes shut and he came to feeling his chest going up and down as if someone was pressing onto it. 
He heard voices speaking "He's coming through! We got a pulse! We got him!"
Guardian frowned hearing the voices sounded excited but worried to him as he opened his mouth and sucked in air into his body. He kept on breathing in the air as he felt the pressure on his chest ceased followed by a hand holding onto his left hand in a tight grip he felt was feminine and seemed familiar to him. Guardian again heard the familiar sinister laughter again found he again contained in his tube while wearing his oxygen mask on he hearing voices.
He heard "Eli, its time for him to come out now!"
Guardian heard in response "You will forget ordering me to get this patient out of the tube now."
He stiffened from the Compeller's voice tone that sounded of Eli's to him followed by again the sinister laughter making him annoyed. He found himself seated in a bar as if blinking his eyes while sipping a drink that appeared to be alcoholic to him. 
Guardian frowned thinking to himself "What's going on?"
He heard nothing in answer to his question only to feel a hand clamp down onto the cup he was holding to find the owner belonged to a female appearing to look familiar to him he didn't recognize. He frowned eyeing her warily to find the female yanking the cup from his hand and putting it onto the bar's top and pulling him out of the bar in a fast blurring speed move. He found himself unable to see where he was going by the blurriness. Guardian frowned as he eyed the female with recognition within him he saw was Anna Kremenova. He frowned as the blurriness ceased followed by himself lying naked in bed facing Anna who was stripping her bathrobe and giving him looks of mating to him. He frown feeling himself confused to what was going on as Anna faded from view followed by finding himself twisting onto the bed to face her naked lying on it.
Guardian didn't say a word as Anna spoke "Make love to me now."
He again heard the sinister laughter to find Anna laughing in his face while giving off the sinister sound to his confusion he spoke firmly "Who are you anyway?"
Guardian got Eli he assumed was Anna quitting her laughter like noises to feel her hand touching his sensitive part in a tight grip. 
It made him stiffen as Anna spoke "Just make love to me Guard Beers."
He stiffened from the name she used to obey to her order. Guardian ignored Anna's gasping as he sucked her nipples on her breasts one at a time followed by licking her all over her body with his tongue. He didn't spare her privates down below the waist either he finding himself enjoying the sexual act. Guardian felt himself hard enough to enter her found her hand remained clinging to his sensitive part as he made a move to do the penetration. He again kissed her on the neck only to feel her hand on his sensitive parts remain ironclad blocking him from doing anything mating wise. 
Guardian spoke firmly eyeing Anna in the eyes she not meeting his eyes "You said make love to me now. I'm doing that ritual which involves me inside you as well. So remove your hand off of me now."
He formed a glare in response to glare at Anna who gave up a loud Humph sound followed by her speaking "Time for you to get out."
Guardian frowned finding her voice sounded angry to him as she forced his eyes shut and he passed out unconscious. 

Guardian came to hearing "He's ready to be let out of the sleeper now. So get him out! I'm tired of him now!"
He frowned hearing Eli's voice sounded angry to him as he felt himself back into the tube to feel its water drain out followed by himself sucked out of the tube to land onto metallic floor from the feel of it. He shivered feeling himself cold all over to raise his left hand into his eyesight view to find it was thin in a tanned color with red lines indicating veins to him seen. Guardian frowned while eyeing his hand as he eyed his other hand to find it was twin to his left hand. He saw a pair of shoes come into his eyesight appearing to look black and formal to him along with the pants making him look up to find it belonged to a male form. Guardian kept looking up finding the pants appearing to be black led to a jacket that was almost covering the thigh as he found a cane included with the area. He frowned as he kept on looking up to find the cane's owner was a male with blonde hair appearing to be in a short length and gave him a Compeller's golden eyed look with eyes appearing to be not kind to him. 
Guardian gulped but didn't say a word as the Compeller in response spoke "The name is Barry leader of the Crimson Industries here in Megiddo on the island of Flowers as it's dubbed."
He frown hearing the Meg language spoken from Barry he finding himself understanding a word as the male continued "The Duke of Megiddo the ruler had specific instructions regarding you involving you to heal from something I'm not told what it was. I was told the medical ailment involved you suffering from terrible burns in an eater's burning."
Guardian exhaled a breath hearing Barry's words as Barry continued speaking he forced himself to listen "The Duke gave you a name dubbing you Victor unsure of why he picked that name. Anyhow I don't care to know why your name is like that or why the Duke wished that you be healed at all costs. He'll reveal his purposes when he wishes them to be revealed. The time isn't right at the moment. But the time for you to be out of containment has arrived as indicated by Eli saying it, Guards!"
He found Megs arriving into view pushing a hospital bed that roughly picked him up and dumped him onto it followed by putting an oxygen mask over his mouth and nose he feeling himself sleepy again. Guardian shook his head of the sleepiness only to feel a needle prick of pain in his neck then he fell unconscious.

Guardian woke up feeling he lying on a bed hearing the familiar raspy breathing sound coming closer and closer towards him. He jerked open his eyes to find the familiar skeleton was back standing next to his bed but this time had on wings of a bat and a bottle crown on its head while having a feminine form. Guardian frowned eyeing the skeleton that shifted into Svetlana who shook her head and faded from view. He found himself blinking tears from his eyes while hearing a loud beeping noise getting louder and louder.
He heard "He's pulling through! It's working!"
Guardian frowned hearing the voices for it sounded of medics working on keeping him alive to him. He kept hearing the voices' chatter indicating on a male being kept alive from a death status. Guardian frowned while finding he sucking in air from his mouth and breathing through his nose. He kept on breathing through his nose as the oxygen mask was removed followed by objects on his bare chest ripped off making him grimace. He kept the breathing steady as a hand patted his face on the left cheek in some insisting move.
Guardian heard "Wake up! Come on wake up now!"
He frowned finding the voice sounded familiar to him like he heard before but wasn't sure of where. He lazily opened his eyes to focus onto the hand's owner he finding himself leaning over him with all white eyes to his confusion. 
Guardian frowned as he spoke "Egypt as she's referred has plans for you, Guardian. Hence she letting you lives again after appearing to be perished into some eater explosion involving this thing dubbed helicopter."
He exhaled a breath as he he figured was the Guardian of Life and Death added "Egypt with her purposes is a mystery to me. I'm not privy to her thoughts at the moment. I don't care to know as long as I do her bidding. This time she said for you to live again despite numerous medical procedures as it's called done onto you to keep you alive. I warn you that you'll be doing Egypt a favor once the time arrives. She doesn't do favors towards humanoids even towards me as well. She's like death incarnate. Never favors anyone to live again once death strikes them. This time she made an exception towards you and let you live again. Don't push Egypt with your death requests. Take the second chance she gave you and live now."
Guardian felt his eyes forced shut to come to feeling a rumbling vibration sitting on his chest. He frowned blinking his eyes to feel the rumbling was a cat's purring vibration to focus onto the cat seeing it was orange all over and gave off a loud meow in a soft tone. He frowned eyeing the cat as it licked his chin with its rough tongue followed by arching its back and walking off of him he feeling the vibrations of it walking on the bed. Guardian looked around discovering himself in a cabin from the looks of it indicating was entirely one room with everything needed for inhabitation. He frowned recognizing the cabin as the one he stayed in when he was going around as Robert son of Nikolai. He heard nothing in response to his thought of recognizing the cabin got up from the bed feeling himself clad only in a hospital gown to his annoyance. He looked around the cabin to find a camera dome in the ceiling with a multiple red dots jutting from it. Guardian sighed and didn't say a word in response went to explore the cabin he finding the bathroom facilities behind a wall with a doorway entrance. He went to the sink's mirror to peer only to find it turning entirely into a frosted white color as if anticipating him to look. 
Guardian grunted in response figured to himself "I might as well shower."
He found the shower stall contained the necessitations he needed for cleaning which he stripped himself of the hospital gown and entered the area. He eyed his body finding the lights above in the shower stall turning off plunging him in darkness he unable to see. He found himself annoyed with unable to see what was going on with his body. 
Guardian spoke loudly "Quit sugarcoating the truth from me! Just let me see what's going on!"
He glared at the shower stall's wall unseeing it as the lights remained off to his annoyance. Guardian forced himself to feel his body all over he feeling was thin and not muscular to the feel and seemed to not have much muscles to his annoyance. He cleaned himself fully as he could then while washing off the soap found the stall's light turning on. It blinded him a bit which he forced himself to stare at the floor. Guardian raised his arm into view he finding it looked thin and bony looking and didn't look like it had muscles to him. He groaned softly as he looked down at his chest and stomach to find it was looking thick and muscular to him. 
He sighed to think to himself "The armored vest protected me from the eater's burning."
Guardian frowned as he eyed his stomach to feel all over the area he finding it thin and not indicating of muscles to him despite showing something that indicating it. 
He groaned as he realized "It's my organs sticking out that are making it look this way."
Guardian forced himself out of the shower's stall to dry himself via towel followed by finding the mirror no longer covered in frostiness. He exhaled a breath and steeled himself to look in the mirror at his face. Guardian gasped of shock finding his face looked thin and bony including his eyes appearing to look all black eyed looking and nothing to indicated Egyptian's looks to him. 
He groaned softly to think to himself "What am I going to do to heal myself back into my form as before?"
He heard nothing in answer to his question eyed his teeth to find they remained intact but noticed they were cracked and chipped and looking like fangs to him. He grunted an annoyed sound and without a word left the bathroom with a towel wrapped around his thin bony waist. Guardian found clothes sitting in a dresser drawer on examination. He found the clothes indicated of yoga status to him. He put on the clothes finding he had to cinch the drawstring tight around his waist. Guardian went to the door in the room appearing to lead outside only to hear a faint humming sound from it. He groaned as he went to the windows to peer through the blinds. He found a red brick wall as his view making him confused to why he was contained.
Guardian spoke out loud "Just how long am I here for?"
He heard nothing in answer to his question frowned finding smoke coming from the door in the wall he feeling sleepiness. Guardian went to the bed and laid down staring at the camera dome. He passed out unconscious.

Part Seven: Meeting

Guardian jerked feeling a familiar patting on his face from a cat he grunted an annoyed sound in response. He jerked open his eyes to find an all orange colored cat sitting on his front on its haunches patting his face. He discovered he was back in Mahalia in Olivia's house's basement apartment only to feel an odd feeling like there was something missing going on. He frowned as he eyed Bob the cat warily who got off of him and heard scratching sounds onto the familiar door. He sighed and forced himself to get up he feeling his legs like jelly and refusing to hold him up. Guardian crawled towards the basement door and forced it open despite out of breath to find Bob darting up the stairs. He crawled back into bed and shut his eyes despite lying onto his stomach only to hear a loud meow sounding annoyed to him. Guardian woke up finding he lying on his back with Bob again sitting on his chest. 
He spoke firmly "Stop the insanity now! Stop it!"
He found the cat shifting into Egypt that appeared to be lying onto him while stroking his chest mostly on his abs. He sighed as her hand went higher and higher till it reached his forehead. Guardian frowned as Egypt forced his eyes shut to find himself once again underneath a spotlight facing a seated male with all black eyes displaying the Source as said by Daisuke. 
He again heard the voice speaking its familiar words “Who are you?”
He spoke in response "I'm dubbed Victor."
Guardian heard laughter in response to find the familiar six Senators were standing in a row off his left and appearing to have mirth on their faces. 
He gave them a glare in response to find the voice speaking "Victor isn't your name so talk on what it is!"
He sighed and spoke firmly "I was raised with the name of Guard Beers with the nickname of Guardian."
Guardian got from the Senators quitting their laughter and looking angry to him. 
He didn't comment a response as the voice spoke again "Guardian? What name involves this nickname of Guardian anyway?"
He sighed and spoke again still using the firm voice tone "I believe its Guardian-"
Guardian found a hand clamped over his mouth he finding Egypt in the room floating nearby while having her bat like wings flapping. He frowned finding her hand seemed clawed and found her putting a finger to her lips with a clawed fingernail followed by disappearing from his eyesight. 
Guardian heard "Why are you interrogating my son in question? Cut this joke now!"
He exhaled a breath recognizing the voice as Verona his Mother raiser to frown finding her coming into sight with golden eyes seen and glaring at the Senators. He didn't comment a response as he eyed the Senators warily to find the six men shift forms into four men with long hair and all black eyes and wearing ragged clothing while having lightening flashing from their hands. 
Guardian heard from Verona "Famine, Plague, Sword and Death unhand Egypt's son Guardian now!"
He stiffened from the words she used to eye the four males as if drawn to find one speaking blaring in his mind "She's not kidding on him being Egypt's own son in question."
He frowned finding the voice reminded him of Tut to find Verona marching up towards one of the males and giving a slap onto the male's cheek that flinched from the blow. He frowned as Verona to his shock shifted form into a floating Egypt. Guardian saw the four males get into one knee and appeared to be paying respects towards Egypt as the men bowed their heads cutting off their lightening show. He frowned as Egypt floated towards him and without a word forced his eyes shut.

Guardian wound up dreaming of himself as a seventeen year old walking home from school only to be met on the way a familiar female he recognized as Barton Jackson's girlfriend Matilda. 
He didn't comment a response as Matilda spoke towards him "So tell me where you live hmm?"
He spoke "With a midwife in a residence that rented."
He felt himself annoyed with what he blurted eyed Matilda who spoke again "Care to walk me to your residence? I might as well see what your home looks like. I'm curious."
Guardian sighed and didn't say a word towards Matilda in response took her arm and led the way to his residence where his Mother raiser wasn't home. He unlocked the door once letting go of her arm and walked inside with her following. 
Guardian showed the house to Matilda that appeared to be a bungalow and not much room in it to stop in his room and speaking "This is my room."
He didn't say a word towards Matilda went to sit on the bed and gave her a frown as she looked around the room. He saw his room looked bare of furniture and had a mattress on the floor including a suitcase holding his clothes he was only allowed to keep. He kept his mouth shut as Matilda joined him sitting onto the bed next to him and sighed feeling her hands running through his lengthy hair. 
He didn't say a word as Matilda got him to lie down followed by her straddling him which he stared at the ceiling he figuring to himself "She wants to mate. I might as well let her do the work."
Guardian kept his form still as Matilda got him stripped of his clothes baring him followed by herself stripping of her clothes then again straddling him. He rolled his eyes when he felt her hands onto his sensitive part making him gasp of pleasure. Guardian sighed as he felt her guide his sensitive part inside her thrusting through without anything blocking the way. He kept the eye roll and gasping sounds as Matilda rocked him with hands onto his shoulders giving him pleasure each time he entered her. He gave up a loud moaning like gasp once he spilled himself inside her. Guardian sighed softly to frown finding Matilda getting off of him pulling him out of her followed by putting on her clothes and walking out of the room shutting the door. He groaned and went to his clothes getting up from the bed to put on. He heard the phone ringing sounding of Ahs and Wahs to his confusion.
Guardian shook himself of the dream to recall it was an actual memory of his first times with Matilda he recalling to himself "I never saw her again after that. I didn't hear what happened to her. Instead I heard a rumor of some drunkard mowing down a recently pregnant student with their car and not heavily punished for that. The students in school kept pointing the finger aimed at Matilda as the one whose light was extinguished."
He stiffened to see the Guardian of Life and Death seated in a white chair who was clapping his hands clawed and appearing to look amused cutting the memory from the scene.
Guardian frowned as the Guardian of Life and Death spoke "Bravo Egypt! Shouldn't you be getting over him hmm? Clinging to him with the dream isn't going to work."
He stiffened hearing the word dream to frown as the male got up walking towards him while speaking "Egypt, he's not placed here for you to trifle with his life. Let go of him. Let me balance the scales regarding his life with the creator."
He exhaled a breath to find a hand grabbing his arm yanking him aside out back onto the familiar dark sea view. Guardian found he clad in nothing as Egypt appeared off the ocean floating with a look on her face he saw was pity.
He spoke loudly in response "Mother."
Guardian found the Guardian of Life and Death standing next to him speaking "You can't keep him here forever, Egypt. You'll have to let go of him once and for all for him to be judged to go have his light extinguished."
He stiffened hearing the Guardian of Life and Death's words as the male he saw disappeared in a light show.
He felt compelled to speak spoke "Egypt."
Guardian felt himself shocked with what he said as Egypt he saw glided towards him and with hands onto his shoulders pushed him backwards. Guardian found himself falling backwards as Egypt's hands released their holds onto him. He found himself landing onto something like a mat to grunt with pain from his left arm twisted into a painful hold. He thumped the mat three times as if recalling what to do to find his arm let go. Guardian got up in a fast move to find he facing a Meg while in a karate studio he and the female were both clad in uniforms involving the karate. He felt himself confused as he found muscle memory to fight the Meg as if trying to grab her into lock holds she kept on slinking out of his hands' grips. 
He heard clapping noises to find the Meg giving a bow in a direction which he copied only to hear "That's not necessary, Victor."
Guardian sighed to straighten up his form to find Nikolai in the room standing at the edge of the mat with arms folded. 
He frowned as Nikolai spoke "Come with me, Victor."
Guardian found Nikolai shifting into the Guardian of Life and Death holding a hand out towards him while noticing a golden object behind the male illuminated by a spotlight he saw was a scale. 
He found the Guardian of Life and Death repeating his words “Victor, come with me.”
 Guardian felt a hand familiar grab his arm and yank him out of view into the familiar ocean scene again. 
Guardian frowned while eyeing Egypt warily to find the Guardian of Life and Death walking into sight and speaking "You can't keep Victor hidden from me. I'll always find him no matter where you hide him, Egypt."
He got Egypt shaking her head into a no gesture followed by thrusting him backwards to fall again hitting the mat he finding himself still fighting with a female Meg. This time it involved karate he finding himself easily defeated. Guardian found Nikolai coming into view clapping his hands which he found shifted into the Guardian of Life and Death speaking his familiar words.
He spoke firmly loudly "I thought my name was Guardian not Victor?"
He eyed the Guardian of Life and Death that spoke "Your birth name is Victor actually named after your Mother who's name was Victoria Lynn. Come with me, Victor."
Guardian spoke firmly using the firm voice tone "Then what's going on with my life to require this visit with you?"
He frowned to get from the Guardian of Life and Death in response "You'll remember you life once you come with me for the judgment of the scales."
He exhaled a breath to make a step forwards only to feel a hand grabbing his arm yanking him back to the dark ocean. He stood on the ocean waters feeling the waves lapping onto his feet as he eyed Egypt floating above him. 
Guardian got the Guardian of Life and Death coming into view speaking "What or who are you protecting him from Egypt? Shouldn't he know his own life and his lifetimes he lived? Doesn't he deserve to know what the truth on his own life is?"
He frowned to eye Egypt to see her floating away from him onto the horizon to feel a hand gripping his hand he pulled away from the ocean. He found himself standing naked on steps leading up towards the Guardian of Life and Death standing at the top with a scale next to the male. 
He didn't comment a response as the Guardian of Life and Death spoke "Let judgment onto this soul Victor be done."
Guardian found the male jabbing a finger in a direction he compelled to look to find a round metal arch appear into sight flashing something that resembled a TV monitor adjusting its set. He focused onto the TV he figured was the gated arch as if needing to do it. 
He heard the familiar words from the Guardian of Life and Death "I am the Guardian of Life and Death. I will judge you with my scale on your life."

Part Eight: Judged

Guardian eyed the mental gated arch to see if flash an image of a male wearing gonoid skin clothing from head to foot. Guardian shifted to eye Egypt who was floating next to the Guardian of Life and Death with her wings flapping both appearing to ignore each other. Guardian kept on watching as if compelled a couple get into a mating ritual with clothes adjusted. He kept on watching finding them both ignoring a female as assumed as the female’s mother in the room appearing to be cleaning up clothes left scattered on the floor. He frowned as the scene changed to show Ryder Hawks flying in the air from the tallest tree of the Elizabethan town's forest and flying over the ocean. He kept on watching as if drawn to find one of the Ryder Hawks was carrying a male. This was reminding him of his father appearing to be Hades finding they were following a plane flying in the air. He found the plane landed in a dirt airport followed by Owen appearing to look younger with short blonde hair meeting the plane's inhabitants and finding one of them was a Columbian female he figured was Owen's wife. Guardian kept on watching as the Ryder Hawks brought a male onto Mahalia he found was twin to the Guardian of Life and Death’s appearance, he not sure who he was. He kept on watching as the Guardian, he figured was him got into a city into a hotel room using some mental powers to get inside. Nikolas, his father without the Hades suit wearing Egyptian's suit arrived into the hallway knocking onto a door in a code of knocks of three. He found the door opened by a female wearing a dress with breasts nearly hanging out. 
Nikolas licked his lips and walked into the room shutting the door while speaking "So show me more of what you said you would show me."
Nikolas eyed the female who spoke "The name is Victoria Lynn and that's all you'll know of me so strip and show yourself now. I'm not doing it if you won't."
Nikolas spoke in response "You do know of this hand game of scissors cut?"
Victoria Lynn rolled her eyes and spoke "Yes, I do know of it. Don't drop the subject now, Nikolas."
Nikolas wound up speaking "Loser has to strip an article of their clothing one at a time."
Victoria Lynn spoke "Humph. I'm not playing if you remove your jacket. You have more clothes than I do."
He spoke as he removed his jacket to sling it over the chair "Winner decides what article of clothing gets taken off."
Guardian found his Father and his mother playing the game till it ended when Victoria Lynn had to remove her private's panty that was covering her privates and seat. He frowned finding his Father removing his underwear shorts baring himself and looking like he was on the large size with his body form. 
He frowned as Nikolas spoke "Be prepared to be pleasured."
Guardian watched with ranges of emotions on his face as his Father and his Mother proceeded to touch and lick each other all over not sparing the sensitive parts and privates. He found Nikolas had an enough and was soon thrusting inside Victoria Lynn while running hands on her nipples from both laying on the bed his father on top.
He heard "Nikolas, be careful with the boobs their implants. Don't pop them with your pawing."
Guardian frowned finding Nikolas put hands onto Victoria Lynn's back and resumed doing the thrusting inside her while hearing his Mother moan out "You're good."
He heard the comment spoken repeatedly over and over till Nikolas gave up a loud roar and collapsed onto Victoria Lynn before pulling out and lying onto his back with an arm covering his eyes. 
He frowned as Victoria Lynn spoke "Can't you do something about my life in Mahalia? I don't want to be stuck in this hotel room forever."
Nikolas looked at her and spoke "I'll do what you ask if you provided me with an offspring, a son, an heir, to the throne to take over for me."
Victoria Lynn spoke in response "Oh go back to your miserable excuse of a wife now you foolish idiot."
Nikolas got up without a word and put on his clothes and spoke "Provide me with the son and I'll be in your debt forever for as long as I rule Mahalia."
He got Victoria Lynn tossing him a pillow which he caught followed by the male dropping the pillow and walking out of the room slamming the door with a bang sound. 
He eyed Victoria Lynn who snarled "The nerve of that idiotic king."
Guardian continued to watch as Victoria Lynn picked up a phone book and was looking through it before stopping at a desired page and dialing a number. 
"ABC Pizza" He heard on the phone line as Victoria Lynn spoke "I order food to be brought to my hotel room with the hotel Lancelot to pay the bill." 
He found the scene shifted to show Victoria Lynn sitting in a bathroom next to the toilet and looking pale like she was sick. He frowned as Victoria Lynn threw up into the toilet while she was clad in a bathrobe wrapped around her form still thin and not with child. Victoria Lynn continued to throw up repeatedly then the scene changed to show her in a jail cell looking pregnant but not that heavily to him. 
He found a cop a female coming into view speaking "Come with me now. I want to show you where you can have something to do other than trying to beg for money from people using your pregnant status as has been actress."
Victoria Lynn looked sick to him who didn't say a word in response followed the female cop out to the familiar bar to O’Shea's to meet the familiar owner looking younger this time. 
Shea spoke once at meeting "Yes I think she'll do as the bartender. I've been meaning to hire pregnant females to help out this establishment as females only. You're hired and your name as I will refer you will be Sparkette."
Guardian gave up a loud gasp of shock hearing that as Victoria Lynn got her hair cut into Sparkette's familiar style and familiar uniform despite her bulging pregnancy stomach seen. He exhaled a breath as the scene focused onto Sparkette he figured he'll refer her getting hugely pregnant with him while lying in bed of her seedy apartment and groaning loudly while seeing she was birthing him. He kept on watching as himself was born alone with no help no midwife and Sparkette doing the pulling him out by herself before collapsing onto the seedy lumpy mattress and appearing to be faint unconscious. Guardian heard banging sounds onto the door sounding in a firm insisting tone to find Sparkette waking up and going to the door while leaving him lying on the bed wailing away. 
He kept on watching with annoyance as Sparkette got the door open a crack to find Verona the midwife there speaking "You had the baby. So hand the baby over now. I'll give it a better life than this disgusting life you're living at, at the moment, bitch."
Sparkette in response spoke "Excuse me."
He found her slamming the door to undo the chain and thrusting the door wide while speaking "Baby's on the bed. I just birth it."
Verona went to the baby he saw and appeared to give him a through check up he finding himself having a mop of black hair on his head and intense blue eyes he recalled was twin to his Father's despite the male looking like his were black. He continued to watch as Sparkette slammed the door with a bang sound to find Verona looking at her with a golden eyed glare. 
Sparkette spoke "The baby's father is Nikolas Visser himself."
He found Verona speaking "So? Good riddance."
Guardian heard the sarcasm of Verona's voice tone focused onto Sparkette who held up a bottle he seeing labeled "Guard Beers" and spoke "Just call him Guard Beers. I'll know he's mine when I meet him and he using that name in my face."
Verona picked up the baby and without a word towards Sparkette left the apartment slamming the door with a bang sound. He saw Sparkette grimace from the bang noise but went to the refrigerator and pulled out a bottle of Guard Beers and opened it and then gulped it down before going back to bed and lying down still clutching the beer bottle in hand. He found her going to sleep in response only to wake up when there was a door knocking sound heard in an insisting tone. Sparkette woke up groaning with acting like a headache hurting her got up going to the door to yank open finding a familiar male he recognized as the first Warwick there, looking younger with a grim look on his face. 
Warwick spoke "Can I come in? I have news on Guard Beers."
Sparkette obeyed to let Warwick inside followed by shutting the door softly and going to the refrigerator of the one room apartment to pull out a bag of peas to put onto her forehead. 
Warwick cleared his throat speaking "You sick or something?"
Sparkette spoke in response "I just have a headache. So talk on what's going on with my son since you mentioned his name to me."
Warwick spoke in response "He's his Majesty's son. Tests results say its positive match as him as the Father."
Sparkette spoke "Didn't his Majesty say something about doing anything for me if I provided him with a son?"
Warwick cleared his throat and spoke "His Majesty said he'll fully pay for your rent of this residence just to keep you out the snares of this Jimo jerk using residents to break the law and sexual favors. Don't ask His Majesty for anything else. He's treading a fine line seen in an unfavorable light by the public at the moment who's thinking of removing him from his throne at any slightest mistake he does."
Sparkette spoke in response "So carrying my son was nothing but a mistake-"
Warwick interrupted "His wife wound up carrying another male's offspring which the mating was recorded her appearing to going along with it with this unknown male at the moment. Besides His Majesty told me to admit that his wife's carrying Olga resulted into her being sick a lot with lots of bed rest. I'm surprised that you got the better end of the deal involving pregnancies."
Sparkette removed the bag of peas and spoke in response "I wasn't spared of being sick myself. It took me a great deal of effort to do this stupid bartending job being on my feet for hours while carrying Guard Beers and refraining from drinking despite tempted. I had to do this job even while I was feeling like I wanted to drop into bed and lie there resting my poor feet. My feet wound up swollen enough to cause me problems to get into my shoes. Don't tell me I had the better end of the deal involving pregnancies. I was sick a lot myself."
He heard a beep sound to find Warwick speaking "That's my cue for times up for me. I'll contact you when it's appropriate."
Guardian watched as Warwick left the apartment shutting the door to find Sparkette locking it behind him and going back to bed to lie down while rubbing her forehead and speaking "The nerve of that idiot Nikolas. One of these days Hades will get a hold of him and teach him a lesson. My son will be crowned king in his place I'll see to it."
He found Sparkette groaning while lying in bed to realize with a start that her mind was being scanned by the Meritanians while she was suffering a headache from the mind scanning. He exhaled a breath to continue to watch as the scene changed to show an older Sparkette he saw from the bar walking into her apartment only to get a cloth covering her mouth and going unconscious from the looks of it. He kept on watching as Sparkette's unconscious form was hauled out of the apartment into the back of a sedan's trunk with black tinted windows and looking sinister to him making him nervous. Guardian continued to watch as if compelled as the sinister sedan drove away, away from the building and reached an airport to enter a building where he saw a familiar plane was seated. He found Sparkette taken out of the trunk she awake and swearing wording that sounded confusing to him. 
Sparkette wound up forced into the plane to meet the Guardian seated in a chair speaking "Hello Andreea."
Sparkette in response gave up a spit sound while looking furious only to get from the Guardian speaking "Your Nikolas is dead died in a plane accident. I just saved your life from the machinations of his wife Queen Svetlana who's been seeking you to have you dead."
The Guardian added "I am called Nikolai-"
He was interrupted "I know who you are. Bastard son of Charles Crimson the developer living in Megiddo who doesn't seem to care anything about nature but his own money gain in question."
Nikolai spoke in response "Interesting that you would call me a bastard since your own son is a bastard himself hmm?"
Sparkette got thrust to kneel who gave Nikolai a glare in response to find the male speaking loudly "Tell the pilot to get clearance to take off now. I don't give a damn if Nikolas's plane is having trouble. I want off of Mahalia and back onto Megiddo now immediately."
Nikolai got handed a cup full of brown liquid by a sexy clad in lingerie female to sip the drink in front of Sparkette who looked around the room finding it didn't have windows and appeared to not indicate anything of plane moving. 
Sparkette spoke in response "I'm not doing any sexual favors towards you."
Nikolai in response chuckle a sound and spoke after a lengthy sip "Actually I have something in mind for you Andreea Luna-"
"How did you know my name?" He was interrupted by Sparkette glaring at him with a glare. 
Nikolai kept on sipping and spoke during a pause of sipping "I have my ways of knowing things, Miss Luna. Such as your stage name is Victoria Lynn as known on Columbia but in Mahalia its Sparkette while your served that dead end bartending job and not able to get any acting jobs in question. Am I right in that hmm?"
Sparkette gave up a loud Humph sound in response to get from Nikolai speaking "Don't you remember that stupid pizza boy you didn't tip for giving you pizza once you had that sexual romp with His Majesty Nikolas himself?"
Guardian found the scene changing to show Sparkette looking younger in her Victoria Lynn persona answering the door after hearing a knocking sound to get Nikolai disguised as the pizza boy carrying her pizza via box entering the room and placing it onto the table. He found Nikolai as the pizza boy clearing his throat and removing the hat while letting his hair tumble down getting Sparkette giving off her familiar language words in an angry voice tone and thrusting a finger at the door that was open. 
Nikolai as the pizza boy in response spoke "Tsk such language Miss Luna. You can't get rid of me easily as you hoped so spill it why you reek of another male's cologne onto you."
Sparkette as Victoria Lynn spoke "It's none of your business, Nikolai. So get out now. Leave me in peace to eat. I'm hungry."
Sparkette went to the pizza box to open it up while giving a loud gasp sound and thrust the box's lid shut and speaking while facing Nikolai "You son of a bitch!"
Nikolai spoke in response "I owe you a favor Miss Luna and I intend to pay back my favors. So get onto the bed and wait while I call for my personal physician to attend to this procedure in question."
Sparkette gave up a loud Humph sound in response and got onto the bed lying onto it as Nikolai went to the phone speaking in Meg's language "Everything is set now sent the proper people up to this room immediately."
He watched as Nikolai went to the pizza box to open it lifting up a syringe showing it had various medical devices onto it and speaking "Nighty night, Miss Luna."
Guardian frowned as Sparkette rolled her sleeve and got injected with the syringe into it by Nikolai followed by the male stripping himself of the pizza boy's uniform to show his familiar white suited uniform and waited seemingly lengthy as the female fell unconscious. He saw paramedics arrive into the room and proceeded to strip Sparkette of her bathrobe and appeared to be waving scanners over her abdomen area while injecting various needles into the area. The sun was seen rising then setting followed by the room scene again to show Sparkette in the bathroom throwing up in the toilet while still clad in her bathrobe. 
He watched as Nikolai came into view to rub a hand onto her back followed by her speaking "This better be worth carrying him. I don't like the joke of tricking that idiot into thinking it's his own son I'm carrying but some medical experimental baby to come to existence."
Guardian gasped hearing Sparkette's words to find her throwing up again followed by Nikolai speaking "Medical experiment isn't what he is. He's Nikolas's son actually and he always will be including yours as well. You get what you want a piece of Nikolas and he gets what he wants a son to take over his throne."
He exhaled a breath as Sparkette spoke during a break of throwing up "Some piece he's turned out to be. I do hope he's not turning out to make me sick in bed a lot. I heard awful things regarding that bitch wife of his carrying his daughter Olga making her sick in bed."
Nikolai spoke "Don't worry about the bitch as you refer her. I'll handle her. Leave her to me. Just worry about carrying the son inside you."
Sparkette spoke once looking at Nikolai "Too bad I can't drink my favorite beer Guard Beers. It's forbidden for carrying females to drink anything beer wise."
Nikolai spoke while rubbing a hand over her forehead he showing he had the all black eyed look in control "You'll get your drink, Miss Luna. Don't worry. You won't remember this till we meet again when it appropriate."

Guardian found the scene changing to show Sparkette in the present day gasping while eyeing Nikolai she speaking "You bastard! Now I remember what you did to me!"
Nikolai spoke "Interesting insult Miss Luna. Now spare me the insults, Andreea."
Guardian found the TV monitor went black to focus onto the Guardian of Life and Death in response to find Egypt floating behind the male with a finger to her lips. He frowned while eyeing the Guardian of Life and Death who held up a black gloved hand to grunt as he saw a ball of light come out of his chest to reach the male's hand. He found the Guardian of Life and Death putting the ball onto a scale and adjusted it to be equal and let go. 
He eyed the scale to see Egypt floating nearby to hear "Egypt, don't you dare manipulate the scale. I know your here hiding."
Guardian exhaled a breath to eye the scale as if drawn to hear a loud shrieking sound sounding familiar to him like he heard it before to hear "I am the Guardian of Life and Death. I will judge you with my scale on your life."
He didn't say a word in response as the scale tipped over onto one side followed by darkness arriving to his eyesight then nothingness surrounding him.

Part Eight: Verdict

Guardian came to find he lying on sand still wearing gonoid skin clothing that is twin to someone familiar from the feel of it. He wound up feeling fine like he wasn’t burned got up to discover he’s in a desert. Guardian saw a flash of light above him to spot in the endless moving cloudy sky was a round metal gate with white light in it. He frowned staring at the gate as he felt himself moving towards a direction as if drawn. Guardian looked down at the horizon seeing nothing in his view as he continued to walk feeling himself drawn to walk in that direction. He continued to walk till a figure appearing to have a gonoid head he recognized as a jackal and a humanoid like muscular body is standing in his view while wearing a white skirt. He walked up to the jackal and found himself walking around the gonoid head figure only to feel his arm grabbed by his clawed hand. 
He stared at the jackal that spoke a comment of “Never mind, carry on.” 
Before releasing him to turn facing the direction he came. Guardian felt confused felt himself still drawn continued to walk to discover a stone arch. He walked through to discover it led to a stone city where there are people he saw are humanoid versions of Egyptia's gonoids that stare at him with narrowed eyed looks. He continued to walk taking a path through the stone city while being escorted on both sides by races walking away from him that appear to be following him walking in the city. He reached a large courtyard to see a metal gate arch like the TV monitor sitting in a wall with a chair in front of it and three steps in front of it. He stood waiting as the gate flashes showing a figure wearing a mask of the Sun with glowing golden eyes and body in a male form covered in a white loose robe and black gloves on the hands and feet hidden walked out. The male is followed by two, a male and female wearing blue jumpsuits holding knife staff in their hands that have twin looks in their faces despite pointed ears. He frowned as the figure with the mask sat in the chair and the twins he assumed was they despite their ears flank the male on both sides. 
He stood waiting as he heard a male voice sounding odd speaking "The Human in front of us isn't a Human but a reborn warrior of Humanity said to live over and over again achieving peace and prosperity on planetary worlds."
He frowned hearing that while hearing the mutters of the ruler's words echoed among the others surrounding him in a semi circle while feeling that the ruler was talking about him. He felt confused about the ruler saying that he’s not what he is despite he lived a life as a Human. 
He again heard the Pharaoh speak "The Human is to be put to work among the Surrai carving the God statue Amen Ra in the mountain wall."
Guardian saw what the ruler is talking about saw the mountain wall appear to be made out of hard stone and the Surrai are humanoid like Humans with golden Human eyes and clawed hands that are being used to hack at the wall with very slow effort. He found its due the wall being not that easily carved. He saw that the Surrai’s efforts are in vain for their not making any progress. 
He got a little frustrated when he discovered that the Surrai wasn’t listening to anyone telling them "You should give up carving the statue for it’s a waste of time." 
Guardian got roped by some races bullying him with threats "I'll use you as a punching bag if you don't bother to haul water in two large sized heavy buckets by handles to a well in one part of the city and hauling it to the Surrai who would drink from it from their hands while still doing their work." 
Guardian found that he didn’t get a break from doing the water hauling for one Surrai would drink up all of one bucket’s contents leaving it empty and he would have to go to the well repeatedly to fill in the buckets. Guardian discovered that the Surrai quit doing their work when the sunlight gets dim and watched them go into the ground leaving white stalks sticking out. He found that he has to sleep on the ground for no one has bothered to give him shelter or a bed for him to sleep on. He dreamed of Egypt with a feminine form of a female Human standing on an icy cliff looking sad by the face while clad in purple robes. Then dream ended as Guardian got waken up by a foot connecting to his stomach and saw the Surrai are out of the ground with the sun light slowly becoming brighter. 
He wound up ordered "You're to get water for us, Surrai now!"
He protested "You're work on the mountain wall is useless." 
Guardian wounded up being knocked to the ground hitting his head on the stone floor and feeling dizzy enough to shut his eyes only to open them being kicked at repeatedly by multiple Surrai while feeling himself sore from their feet hitting him. He got pained all over to groan loudly then the Surrai stop and go into the ground. He discovered that they’ve been kicking him all day and its sunset. Guardian lied on the ground to shut his eyes only to find that sleep won’t come to him. He lied on the ground still in pain as the image of the sad Egypt flashes in his mind. He finally shuts his eyes forcing himself to sleep only to feel himself kicked again all over by multiple Surrai which woke him up and made him suffer pain again. He found that they’ve been kicking him all day again by them leaving him and going into the ground. Guardian discovered that sleep still won’t come to him despite feeling pain all over and felt that he can’t get up from the ground due to some compulsion to lie on the ground. Guardian loses track of days the Surrai kick him repeatedly all day followed by them quitting to go underground. He found that he can’t sleep no matter how he tried at night followed by still compelled to lie on the ground with the night healing him of his pain till he’s better in the morning. Guardian continued to suffers pain from the Surrai again repeating their kicking which they would do all day till quitting at night time. Guardian found his voice has been cut off whenever he tried to talk during the Surrai kicking him and found that his voice comes back at night leaving him crying for help to stop the suffering he’s receiving. Guardian loses hope of ever stopping his suffering after too many days of this repeats over and over starts crying mentally and at night for Egypt to stop his suffering. 
He kept on begging "I’ll do anything to stop the suffering I'm receiving." 
Guardian continued during the suffering to plead "I'm apologizing for my crimes and wanted to make up for them and will do anything just to stop suffering from my torture." 
He one night after Surrai stop kicking him finds himself too numb to plead for help spoke "If my suffering was payment for my crimes then I have accepted it and will keep on taking it." 
Guardian felt sleepiness shuts his eyes passing out unconscious to wake up feeling himself better. Its daylight with the sun high in the sky with Surrai standing around appearing to be arguing with each other on whether to touch him in an attempt to wake him up after one of them knocked him to the ground knocking him out cold. Guardian discovered that his suffering was a dream remembered his words he said while suffering in the dream.
Guardian frowned wondering "What bargain I made to end the dream and what price I’ll pay for my crimes?" 
He got up to stare at the Surrai who looked irritated as he heard one speak “I had it with clawing the wall for its ruining my claws. I’m not making any progress with the carving.” 
Guardian heard the other Surrai echo the male’s words in agreement followed by them walking away scattering in different directions. Guardian felt himself lost wandered around the city while glared at by the races who acted threatening towards him with their hands in fists whenever he went near them. He found the courtyard again and felt that he couldn’t walk more than too many footsteps from the steps due to some invisible wall blocking him from walking any further. Guardian found himself camping out in the courtyard alone for three suns ignored by the races till there’s a horn sounding its sounds. He stood as the races arrive to stand in a semi circle around him in the courtyard as the Pharaoh he assumed he’ll call him arrived with his familiar guards. 
He stood as the Pharaoh spoke “You Human walk through the gate now.”
Guardian obeyed walking pass the Pharaoh to the gate while getting an image of a place in his mind which he entered the gate. He found himself walking out of another gate to face the Guardian of Life and Death he eyeing the scale that was tipping back and forth refusing to settle onto one end. He frowned while eyeing the Guardian of Life and Death warily to find Egypt floating in the room above the scale and was appearing to use her wings to make it tip back and forth by how heavy her wings were flapping in a blurring speed move. Guardian exhaled a breath and didn't say a word as the Guardian of Life and Death shifted from looking at him to eye the scale with all white eyes narrowed. 
He frowned as he heard "Egypt, I should have known that you would play this joke onto this, Victor, you're favoring at the moment. Quite the joke now and let the scales settle to determine his fate. He'll be judged like anyone else will be. I as Death don't make any favors towards anyone. So stop it now, Egypt."
Guardian eyed Egypt warily to find her putting a finger to her lips as she flapped backwards out of his eyesight. He focused onto the scale to find one end going down and the other end rising up in a fast move. He heard a roar from the Guardian of Life and Death sounding of a familiar roaring noise to him. It made him confused hearing the roaring to feel a heaviness hitting his body as he felt something like a light was blaring into his eyes. He heard the familiar roaring noise that he recalled was Meg's language spoken in a shouting tone continued to focus onto the sound using it to pull him further away. Guardian kept on focused onto the voice he recognized belonged to Nikolai and kept on clinging to the voice sounding furiously angry. 
He heard "We got a heartbeat! He's pulling through! He's taking in oxygen! Sir! Remove yourself now while we work on him!"
Guardian heard nothing more from Nikolai but felt the heaviness arriving to him indicating his body was feeling deadweight to him. He felt himself gulping in oxygen via mouth continued to breathe deeply. 
He flinched from the glare of lights shining onto his eyes only to feel a hand keeping them open followed by hearing "Victor, if you hear me move one of your feet now!"
Guardian felt the deadweight remove itself to feel his feet which he obeyed to flick it back and forth while feeling his other foot doing it. 
He felt the light removed itself from his eyes to groan loudly as he heard again from the voice "Squeeze my hand!"
Guardian felt a hand gloved holding his hand obeyed and got the same twin order to his other hand. 
He grunted feeling himself sore all over and in pain groaned loudly only to hear "Don't worry the pain will go away, Victor. Just concentrate on living now."
Guardian obeyed to grunt feeling a hand patting his cheek followed by hearing "Open your eyes now!"
He found the voice belonged to Nikolai forced open his eyes despite the glare of lights shining onto them. He squinted to focus onto Nikolai leaning over him lying on the bed he felt whose hand was patting his cheek. 
Guardian felt an oxygen mask covering his mouth and nose area focused onto Nikolai who held up two fingers and spoke "Make your hand twin to my hand and hold it up to my eyesight now."
He obeyed grunting of pain to see relief form in Nikolai's eyes as the male got his arm grabbed by a nurse speaking "Nothing more you can do here, Sir. Leave the patient to rest from his trauma."
Guardian frowned as Nikolai gave up a loud roar sounding of the Guardian of Life and Death's voice to him. He eyed Nikolai who gave him an all white eyed glare and jabbing a finger aimed at him before shaking the look away and walking away making him gulp. 
Guardian didn't say a word in response as he thought to himself "I got to live again despite Death not happy."
He focused onto the nurses and doctors attending to him till he felt sleepiness to hear within his mind "Go to sleep smarty. You need the rest."
Guardian sighed hearing Tut's familiar voice blaring in his mind shut his eyes to pass out unconscious only to find himself back at the dark ocean standing in the water. 
He frowned as the Guardian of Life and Death arrived snarling "Egypt! What's so special about this Victor that you're desperate to keep alive at all costs?! He insults me by baring my own face and using my own name of Guardian as his own name! I won't stand being insulted by this Egyptian creation of yours! One way or the other I will have him judged dead to have his light extinguished on a permanent basis! I won't stand this insult you are doing to me!"
Guardian found himself back in bed breathing onto his own while feeling a paw of a cat swatting his face repeatedly. He jerked open his eyes to find the cat an orange ball of fur seated onto his front that removed the paw and gave up an ear splitting meow in a loud tone that sounded annoyed to him. 
He frowned as the cat was removed by Nikolai who spoke "Damn cat for doing that!"
He eyed Nikolai that got the cat out of the room and came back minus the gonoid to stand with arms folded an all black eyed glare aimed at him. 
Guardian gulped hearing Nikolai's familiar beep noise followed by the male's creepy voice speaking "I'm surprised that you're clueless to why I'm here Victor, judging by the looks of your facial expression."
He sighed softly and frowned as Nikolai willed aside the Source to his relief and spoke after another beep sound was heard "You're not a joke like your Mother made you out to be giving you that name of Guard Beers after some alcoholic drink she favored. She thought of the name of Guard Beers as a joke actually."
He hissed out a breath to get Nikolai glaring at him which he spoke "What happened to me anyway?"
Nikolai he stared at spoke "Argh. A medical procedure an old one was done onto you just to give you your muscular strength and looks restored. It was done onto me and Robert with no terrible results of talking to the Guardian of Life and Death like what happened to you anyway."
Guardian grunted in response as he felt something hitting his stomach as he eyed Nikolai. He kept up the grunting to feel something was hitting him in the stomach feeling like a fist repeatedly over and over. He looked away towards his stomach only to feel something like a fist connect with his cheek keeping his head from looking. Guardian felt pain arriving from the punching as Nikolai faded from view along with the hospital room. He found his arms chained up into a raised position along with feet on tiptoes as he felt the fisting continued. Guardian shook his head of the fisting to focus onto the hand's owner finding it was the Guardian of Life and Death fisting him. He gave the Guardian of Life and Death a glare in response that halted the fisting.
He spoke "Bastard couldn't let me go didn't you?"
Guardian glared at the Guardian of Life and Death in response who spoke "One way or the other I will have your light extinguished with your insulting presence-"
He spat out a few mouthfuls of blood onto the Guardian of Life of Death's face interrupting the male who wiped it away with a black gloved clad hand. 
"Interesting" He got from the Guardian of Life and Death. "Twin reaction to me from the Father that spawned this insulting Egyptian that Egypt herself seems to favor too much. Too bad Osiris got an ironclad hold onto the Father enough to make him his vessel dubbing himself by the name of Hades. Odd name, not even sure of why he prefers that to Osiris despite being the God of the Underworld."
Guardian didn't say a word in response only gave up another bloody spit onto the Guardian of Life and Death to find the male wiping it away followed by turning around speaking "Egypt, how nice of you to join us."
He formed a glare at Egypt floating behind the Guardian of Life and Death with wings flapping in a fast furious flapping method and an angry look on her face with her teeth bore. 
He gulped seeing her teeth were fanged like a blood sucker vampire as he heard "How dare you call Victor an insult?! He's my son my offspring you fathered himself! Don't deny this fathering Guardian!"
Guardian frowned hearing Egypt's words for it didn't sound familiar to him instead made him confused. 
He eyed the Guardian of Life and Death that chuckled before speaking "Nice try with pinning Victor as my offspring. You know that I'm not capable of fathering offsprings. Don't deny that fact, Egypt. It's impossible for him to be my offspring anyway. Judging by the looks of him he's nothing but some medical experiment the Egyptians were playing God attempted to create and got him in the process. I managed to erase Osiris's ability to create more offsprings once it was obvious this insulting Egyptian came to exist by the Egyptians playing God. Don't deny that he fathered this insulting son of yours in question."
Guardian focused onto Egypt who spoke "You disappoint me, Mordecai-"
She was interrupted "Don't call me Mordecai! That name is dead within me now! I'm the Guardian of Life and Death-"
Guardian found the male interrupted "Mordecai, Mordecai is your name! Don't deny it like your denying Victor as your son!"
Guardian glared at the Guardian of Life and Death with a glare he figured was the male he saw in the TV monitor of his life paired to a female named Egypt despite the name of Niya used for her. 
He spoke as Egypt paused "That scene of this Eric and Niya being paired together was you and Egypt actually wasn't it?"
Guardian grunted from a fist punching him in the stomach he saw belonged to the Guardian of Life and Death, Mordecai he figured he'll refer him from now on. 
He glared at Mordecai who snarled "I didn't give you permission to speak, Victor. So shut up and be quiet now or I'll keep you forever trapped in purgatory."
He kept up the glare in response to spit onto Mordecai's face giving off blood to see with satisfaction it landed onto the male's cheek. 
He found Mordecai wiping it off and speaking "Like Father like son. Twin spitting. Yuck."
Guardian kept the glare as Egypt was heard shrieking "Mordecai stop denying it that Victor is your son! Stop it now! He's yours as you fathered him! The Egyptians created him-"
He found Egypt interrupted "So the Egyptians were playing God here weren't they hmm Egypt like you admitted?"
He glared at Mordecai to hear from Egypt again shrieking "The Egyptians playing God had nothing to do with it! His existence was to help answer a question that was plaguing them! So release him now! I'll do what it takes to free him from your grips you idiot!"
Guardian kept the glare onto Mordecai to find the male turning around and speaking "You'll do anything to free your son this insulting Egyptian from my grips wouldn't you, Egypt?"
He glared at Mordecai who added hearing nothing from Egypt "Just be gone Egypt, out of my sight now for insulting me with that word idiot and insulting me with the fact that this Egyptian claimed to be fathered by me when I know he's not. Be gone now."
Guardian focused onto Egypt to find her folding her arms and refusing to budge from her floating position while giving Mordecai a narrowed eyed glare in response. 
He spoke in response "You sure that the Egyptians are capable of creating this medical experiment you call me? I thought they wouldn't be able-"
He was interrupted "Egypt and her people are capable of anything including spawning you, you insulting Egyptian to bare my face and my name. I won't stand having you living with your insulting presence-"
"Don't you dare do anything to my son, Mordecai?" He heard from Egypt shrieking in her angry voice tone.
Guardian glared at Mordecai to speak "Your name is Mordecai-"
He got interrupted again "The name is the Guardian of Life and Death! Mordecai's light was extinguished! He's no more!"
Guardian spoke ignoring Mordecai's outburst "So? I had to put up with this ridiculous name of Guard Beers all my life by my mother raiser. She habitually kept calling me Guardian even to my face-"
"Your name is Victor and don't forget it!" He was interrupted by Mordecai.
Guardian spoke firmly while glaring at Mordecai "Victor? Why are you calling me that name despite my presence insults you hmm?"
He glared at Mordecai who gave up a loud roar in response and charged towards him with hands' fisted to find Egypt appearing between the two of them with wings flapping in a furious move her back to him. 
He heard "I told you Egypt that he insults me with his presence, his face and his use of my name of Guardian! Now let me extinguish his life for insulting me! Or I won't free him from here instead let him remain in purgatory forever!"
Guardian formed a glare in response to hear "Remaining in purgatory is where he'll be. I refused to let you extinguish my son's life. I refused to let you lay a hand onto our son-"
"Stop it with the insulting fact of him being my son when you know he's not!" He heard from Mordecai interrupting Egypt.
He spoke firmly "You're jealous! You're jealous that a simple Egyptian was able to father a son through your love of your life, Egypt herself!"
He cut himself off to find Egypt giving him a glare as Mordecai was heard "Do you want me to extinguish his light for his insulting words Egypt?"
Guardian continued to yell ignoring Egypt glaring at him "You're jealous! Admit it Guardian of Life and Death! You're upset that some male managed to father a son through Egypt the love of your life! Hence you are finding me insulting! You said it yourself that you weren't capable of fathering offspring! You're obviously jealous! Admit it now!"
He glared at Mordecai to find the male giving off a soft growling noise with eyes narrowing in a glare aimed at him. He returned the glare in response to feel the chains wrapped around his wrists let go to find himself back onto the soles of his feet and arms lowered. 
Guardian folded his arms while glaring at Mordecai hearing silence from Egypt to find the male speaking "One way or another I will have your light extinguished. Mark my words for it's an oath I will see it come to fruition with the scales judging you dead. Egypt, get your piece of trash excuse of a son out of my sight now. He's free from purgatory and free to live again on Egyptia. I will be watching for the slightest opportunity I oath that, Egypt."
He saw Mordecai turn around walking away out of sight to find Egypt floating into sight a glare on her face with anger in her eyes. 
He spoke firmly "What? I spoke the truth as I see it regarding him."
Guardian got Egypt giving off a sound of disgust in response followed by her fluttering up towards him to place hands onto his shoulders and he felt himself pushed backwards to fall seemingly lengthy. He found his back hitting a bed to grunt feeling a hand patting his cheek while hearing a familiar growling noise. 
Guardian jerked opens his eyes to find Nikolai was the hand's owner who snarled "I didn't give you permission to fall asleep on me lecturing you."
He heard the growling tone of Nikolai's twin to Mordecai gulped but kept his mouth shut as Nikolai removed his hand and added "Don't return to Mahalia or your old life, Victor."
He exhaled a breath hearing Mordecai's voice sounding from Nikolai to find the male wasn't displaying an all white eyed look instead was displaying Egyptian blue eyes.
Guardian kept his mouth shut as he eyed Nikolai he figured "Nikolai is another form of Mordecai, I think."
He kept his mouth shut to his thought while eyeing Nikolai who spoke "Your life in Mahalia is gone, Victor. You've been declared dead by this miserable excuse of a Queen declaring you the son she bore that was born dead hence she having a miscarriage to explain this rumor going around Mahalia. It's just an excuse for her to gain control of Mahalia underneath her thumb despite some car explosion tried to kill her off. Unfortunately someone warned the Queen of the car explosion and she switched places with a servant maid disguised to look like her. I heard she used the maid that was scapegoat to be your mother actually instead of believing it from this Victoria Lynn."
Guardian exhaled a breath hearing that as Nikolai continued speaking "Don't worry about Victoria Lynn. I have her someplace safe where I'll arrange for a meeting once the time arrives. I managed to get her to safety when it was obvious your Father died in that plane crash. She safe underneath the Lancelot group actually."
He sighed softly hearing Nikolai's words regarding his Mother to frown seeing Egypt peering over the male's shoulder before flapping into view he confused to see her. He frowned as Nikolai appeared to not notice Egypt flapping loudly with her wings instead went to sit down in an armchair groaning loudly while rubbing a hand onto his forehead. 
Guardian focused onto Egypt to find her jabbing a finger aimed at Nikolai he hearing her speaking "Ask how you came to exist."
He obeyed to speak "How did I come to exist?"
Guardian got from Nikolai snarling loudly "Bloody Lance Richard he had to ask me that question!"
Guardian frowned while giving Nikolai a glare that raised his head to stare at the ceiling before hearing from the male "Alright, your Father was desperate to have a male takeover his throne after it was obvious he married this bitch Svetlana who wanted the throne herself and was going to do anything to get it. I had managed to search high and low for a female acceptable of carrying you. You were created via medical experiments done onto your Mother using pieces of your Father's DNA they call it to create you within her. Also you were manipulated to not to be like the bitch's own daughter Olga a drinker of alcoholic drinks that was implanted into the bitch herself and using your Father's DNA for that. Svetlana's carrying of Olga wound up repeatedly brought her near death over and over but for some reason Svetlana kept on holding onto life even whenever she got sick to the point of having her light extinguished."
Guardian spoke "Who's Svetlana really anyway?"
He eyed Nikolai who lowered his head to stare at him back before the male spoke "The bitch incarnate, my own pouch sister, Helena."
He gulped hearing Nikolai's words as Nikolai added "Helena is her actual name despite she referring herself as Svetlana some relative of the Tsarina at the moment. It was just a ploy to trap your Father into marriage who pursued her. Too bad your Father lost interests into my own sister and was pursuing someone else. She came to me whining of your Father not interested in her and wanted to be implanted with an offspring of his. Bad choice I made as a result in helping her. She laid a trap to your Father in marriage once it was obvious she was carrying Olga despite she laid down sick a lot. Your Father didn't marry the bitch till Olga was born once it was obvious he was her child's father."
Guardian spoke in response "Then what's with Helena having ability to mind scan people's minds like communicating with them and use Compeller's voice talent orders onto people including immunity to that?"
He got Nikolai giving him the Source look in response to gulp which he spoke in response "I got a memory of Svetlana communicating with me mentally using mind scanning abilities including reading my mind. I also have a memory of her being immune to Compeller's voice talent orders and she giving off twin voice abilities. Is that my head talking or I did get this from her actually?"
He eyed Nikolai in response to get the male getting up going towards him hold up a hand once at the foot of the bed he feeling a choking sensation in his throat. 
Guardian gagged out "Why am I having these odd memories of Svetlana acting not like an Egyptian but someone with special abilities?"
He continued to gag felt himself breathing air deeply to find Nikolai had folded his arms but still kept the Source in control.
Guardian continued "I have odd memories of Svetlana obeying to Hades and what he wants like he wanted to use her for mating which she obeyed and fell asleep underneath his order in front of me by him rubbing her back."
He clamped his mouth shut only to gasp for air when Nikolai held up a hand his eyes narrowed into a glare he again felt himself choking. 
He gagged out "I have a memory of Hades in Mahalia's state forest park having a cold ability to make it snow which he did onto my Father's plane. He got aboard the plane once it crashed and dumped the Hades suit and mask onto my Father who became that person as a result."
Guardian again felt himself breathing gasped for air gulping through his mouth to hear a familiar beep followed by hearing "Your memory is a joke regarding my sister and her mental abilities. It's not true that she can do what your memory thought of. So drop the subject now. As for Hades it seems that your Father remembers himself and is trying to have his previous life back while as that vampire in question. Don't do what he's doing trying to have his previous life back on Mahalia. Forget Mahalia, Victor. Just live with the second chance of living. You cheated the Guardian of Life and Death of declaring your light extinguished. Just take the second opportunity at life, Victor."
He exhaled a breath hearing Nikolai's creepy voice tone had a hidden edge in the voice he recognized from his Mother raiser whenever she spoken a lie to him. 
Guardian didn't say a word instead thought to himself "I'll do what it takes to get back to Mahalia to confront Svetlana and her machinations. I don't give a damn what Nikolai says about his sister. He's lying about her and lying about something including lying about my previous life in Mahalia."
He kept his mouth into a thin line and adjusted his pillow on the bed to settle his head while hearing nothing from Nikolai in response. Guardian shut his eyes feeling himself passing out unconscious to come to feeling water dripping onto his face. He grunted an annoyed sound to jerk open his eyes he squinting from the sunlight's glare blaring onto him. 
He heard "Get up cadet now!"
Guardian obeyed getting up awkwardly finding his body whined in pain as if his muscles were sore all over. He found the voice was a male wearing a military uniform he discovering himself on a warship belonging to Brittany by the flag seen and at a seaport appearing to not be Megiddo to him. 
He frowned as the uniformed male spoke "Alright get this piece of garbage to the medical bay for quarantine now before he sickens anyone around here!"
Guardian found his arms grabbed by two males wearing black masks over their eyes and white orbs seen while having black and white smooth clothes on and having gloves on their hands. He exhaled a breath as one of the males bared their teeth to discover it was twin to a vampire from the looks of it to get jerked into a direction by hands onto his arm. He forced his feet to move finding the males refused to budge from letting go of his arms. 
Guardian found the two males he figured were vampires kept their holds onto him while jerking his arms practically out of the socket into directions he figured "Their leading me somewhere."
He heard nothing from the vampires to his thought as he was jerked led to the medical bay he discovered was a tented area on the deck where medical personal wearing hazardous suits got him inside he freed from the males. Guardian didn't comment a response as the medics proceeded to spray him all over with some smoke including scrubbing him with sponges not sparing his sensitive parts. He felt annoyance take hold as they kept up the spraying and sponging seemingly lengthy to make him give off a growling noise. Guardian heard faint roaring noises from outside the tent cutting his growling noises. He eyed his hand to discover it was the same except had blackness being scrubbed off he feeling himself annoyed. He kept on eyeing his body to discover it was covered with black slimy sludge he recognized belonged to the Knivers' blood. He felt annoyance take hold as the medics washed the blood off of him and then injected a needle into his seat he feeling the pain of it. Guardian grunted an annoyed sound to focus onto one of the medics to find a Meg was wearing the hazardous suit as he saw others were of Megs wearing suits. He kept his mouth shut into a thin line as he felt something plastering his face. Guardian reached a hand onto his face only to get the medics holding his hands and scrubbing his face in a fast move. He grunted and without a word reached the back of his head as if compelled and tore at the skin there. He found the skin easily peeling off followed by peeling off his face he grunted from the pain. Guardian found himself holding Hades' mask in his hands to his confusion which he felt a compulsion to tear it in half obeyed. He found the mask crumbling up into dirt in his hands and got his face and hands scrubbed clean. 
Guardian frowned thinking to himself "What happened to get me wearing Hades' mask and suit anyway?"
He heard in response "Enough of the bath now! He's fine for now! So get him some clothes and get Victor out of this tent!"
Guardian frowned hearing Nikolai's voice to find the male not in sight to find the Megs in response thrusting him a jumpsuit which he put on expertly and shoes he slipped onto his feet. He walked out as gestured by the Megs to do it by them pointing at a direction. Guardian obeyed to walk into the sunlight to glare squinting to find his arms again grabbed by the familiar vampires and got jerked to go into the middle of the deck. He frowned as the deck lowered itself revealing a stairwell which he got pushed to go down. Guardian found the two vampires refusing to follow instead left him to go down the stairs alone he finding himself seemingly going down lengthy while smelling something of stinky stale air to him. The air seemed familiar to him to his confusion till he found a spotlight at the end of the steps walked towards it only to get a familiar figure coming into sight. 
He groaned recognizing Mordecai who spoke "I am the Guardian of Life and Death-"
"Spare me of that talk Mordecai!" He heard from Egypt interrupting Mordecai who floated into view flapping her wings in a fast move. 
Guardian spoke "Spill it you had me become Hades as an excuse to judge my life on your scales didn't you?"
He glared at Mordecai to hear "Get this miserable excuse of insulting trash out of my sight now!"
He found Egypt floating into view to push him backwards he falling backwards to again feeling his seat hitting something hard and metallic while hearing snickering like laughter as he passed out unconscious. 

Part Nine: Past Hurts

Guardian grunted from the whip hitting him onto his back as he glared at Queen Svetlana he back in Mahalia. He kept on glaring at her with his all black eyes narrowed into a glare that appeared to be sneering despite fear in her eyes. 
He kept up the glare as the Queen spoke in Compeller's voice tone "You will tell me what you remember surviving that helicopter crash now!"
He found himself compelled to speak finding himself speaking "What helicopter's crash are you talking about Svetlana?"
Guardian kept the glare aimed at the Queen to see her eyes narrow with a concentration look onto there to see clearly in his mind a lighted cauldron flashing along with a headache of his mind scanned. He kept on seeing the lighted cauldron flashing repeatedly as the Queen looked away giving off a disgust sound. He kept the glare aimed at her despite chained with manacles keeping his arms above him while in the gym room of the King's residence. He ignored his naked status to glare at the Queen willing he to be calm and not angry. 
He eyed the Queen who spoke in response "You've seen my brother haven't you, Victor?"
Guardian spoke in response "What brother are you babbling about Stepmother?"
He got the Queen grimacing in response who spoke "Guards! Free Victor from his binds and dump him in the brig now!"
Guardian found the guards appearing to be Compellers with golden eyes seen grabbing him and freeing him from the chains to force walk him out of the room. He paid attention to where he was taken to find himself thrust into a cell in the basement while hearing groaning noises of a male's tone in another cell besides his. 
Guardian grunted an annoyed sound he sat down onto the lumpy bed to hear "So why are you in this jail cell hmm? Don't deny it that I can hear your breathing sir."
He sighed recognizing Herod's familiar voice spoke firmly "I'm nothing but an insult to the Queen with my presence and me being alive when my light should have been extinguished."
Guardian heard in response "Ah I see. Your using the same old wording whoever speaks to me in answer to why their jailed from the Queen having them ordered put there."
He shrugged in response to grimace from the pain on his back and leaned against the cold stone wall hearing nothing from Herod. He kept his mouth into a thin line to recall fully how he got back to Mahalia into the Queen's presence.
He recalled "I made a deal with Mordecai aka Nikolai as he's going around now for extinguishing the Queen's life in return of extinguishing mine. He took the deal literally and tried to play light extinguisher onto the Queen I saw via dream recognized him as Mordecai her brother. Humph. Some deal it turned out to be. The Queen managed to get rid of his Guardian of Life and Death powers away from Mordecai into her. It wound up making his Egyptian persona Nikolai upset enough to have a crying breakdown. Poor Nikolai, Jones managed to kick me out of Nikolai's residence once finding his Master lying on the kitchen floor crying in tears while I was kneeling next to him. Jones sort of used Compeller's voice talent orders to get me out and wandering around the city till someone appearing to be one of the Queen's guards from the palace jabbed a syringe into my neck and knocked me out unconscious. I woke up by whipping onto my back by the Queen's orders while in the palace then thrown into the brig once she was done with me. Humph."
Guardian heard nothing in response to his thinking heard from Herod again "Ah bitch incarnate Queen Svetlana decided to grace me with her presence. Something you want from me since I'm busy here?"
He frowned hearing Herod's words to focus onto the cell bars to find one of the guards standing behind it a golden eyed glare as he continued to hear "Is that the only insult you can think of Herod? Calling me a bitch since you have refused to say who in Brittany put you into this spying position to spy onto Mahalia and her ruler myself?"
Guardian heard snickering like laughter in response sounding in Herod's voice followed by the male speaking "You the ruler? All it'll take is Brittany sending a male with your talents of a Compeller to court you heavily and get marriage done before kicking you out of position you bitch."
He frowned to hear from the Queen in response "Courting me heavily? Nice try Herod. Nikolas survived the plane crash actually-"
"As that vampire Hades actually-" He heard her get interrupted by Herod only to hear from the Queen "Hades? He's not Hades now and won't ever be. I made sure that was removed from him. He's down recovering underneath observation-"
"Locked up in some lunatic asylum stark raving mad like a crazy loon is what Nikolas is now doing at the moment." He heard from Herod who added "You put him there bitch with that Compelling voice talent of yours enough to punish him for not going along with you plans to rule Mahalia by yourself. Baa. The sheep will be flocking out of Mahalia once they glimpsed you in their leadership position."
Guardian frowned forming it on his lips to hear Herod repeat the word Baa repeatedly only to get interrupted "Nevertheless Herod explains Victor being alive when he was supposed to be assassinated."
He exhaled a breath to listen to Herod's explanation to hear "Oh Victor being alive? What are you talking about you bitch? You raved like a happy person to me on Victor being assassinated and out of the way for you to rule Mahalia forever. No one lives forever and not even you."
He stiffened as he heard in response "I am the Guardian of Life and Death. I will judge you with my scale on your life."
Guardian exhaled a breath hearing Mordecai's familiar words sounding in the Queen's voice to hear hysterical like laughter from Herod in response followed by hearing "Go ahead and try to extinguish my light Guardian of Life and Death as you now call yourself. I thought being Queen of Mahalia was satisfactory to you. Appears you crave more than just being Queen isn't it hmm?"
He heard a growling noise to focus onto the Compeller guard watching him to see the male back up followed by the Queen walking by that paused and gave him an all white eyed glare.
He wound up hearing from her using a creepy voice "Your light will be extinguished, Victor. I'll see to it for that insult you are in my presence."
Guardian gave up a sound of disgust in response as the Queen walked away after shaking her head and was followed by four of the guards. 
He heard from Herod hysterical laughter sounding in a firm voice tone followed by hearing "Bitch is crazy isn't she Victor since she got you in a cell near mine?"
He spoke in response "What have I missed since I was declared light extinguished?"
Guardian heard from Herod "Nothing much actually. The public got over being fearful of plane rides by the Queen taking one to Republic State to do the King's Day parade. Too bad the Queen is nuts to think the public will accept her into the leadership position. They were heard booing her when she rode the King's car in the parade she acting like they were cheering her anyway. She raved like a lunatic to me once contained that the public accepted her into leadership position despite I knowing they were rejecting her actually. Too bad she only hears and sees what she wants and not what people have been doing to her actually."
Guardian frowned to hear hysterical laughter from Herod again to focus onto the cell bars to find the Queen standing behind there with eyes glowing of a Compeller making him gulp. He kept his mouth into a thin line as the Queen glared at a guard and jerked her head towards him. He frowned to find the guards entering the cell and grabbing his arms followed by hauling him out to follow the Queen taking a route to the familiar teenaged bedroom.
Once inside the Queen spoke ignoring her eyes golden as a Compeller "Its Herod who's crazy actually. He has refused my efforts to give up various information despite being a spy from Brittany as pointed out via spies in that nation who identified him actually."
Guardian heard her voice tone indicated that she lie spoke firmly as he was thrust to sit onto the bed "You sound like you're not fully saying anything to me."
He clamped his mouth into a thin line as the guards' arms around him became ironclad followed by forcing him to stand as the Queen walked up towards him to place a hand onto his cheek. He grimaced feeling his mind scanned only to see fully in his mind the familiar cauldron lighted image. 
Guardian grunted as the Queen released his cheek to slap him on the face hard followed by snarling "Someone betrayed me! His mind is impossible for me to penetrate with my mind walking ability!"
He exhaled a breath hearing that from the Queen who kept on snarling "Just see Victor down in bed sleeping. I have plans for him since its obvious the restless sheep have refused to accept me as their leader. They keep on clamoring for Victor to lead them despite excuses said repeatedly they refused to believe."
Guardian kept his mouth into a thin line as the guards got him lying down onto the bed followed by compelling him to sleep which he obeyed shutting his eyes. Guardian wound up dreaming of the Queen wearing a red dress with a golden crown on her head seated at a desk looking old and odd looking as he saw torch lights and stone block walls. The door to the room where the Queen was sitting yanked open as a male was thrust inside with two guards wearing armor and thrust to kneel. He stiffened seeing the male was himself with long hair while wearing gonoid skin clothing and looking annoyed. 
The male spoke "Helena, what's the meaning of this?"
Helena he assumed was the crowned female gave up hysterical laughter in response and spoke "I see a pest I have to get rid of. Cut off his head now!"
Guardian found the male yelling out "Helena no!"
The male's head was chopped off by a guard cutting it off with a sword as Helena added "See his body thrown into the eater now."
He heard hysterical laughter from Helena as the guards obeyed followed by following the guards entering the hallway and leaving the castle while carrying the male's head and body towards an eater pile in the middle of the courtyard. Guardian frowned as the guards carrying the male's body slumped over followed by a male figure grabbing the man's body and head to dump into a body bag then vaulted onto a horse riding it out of the castle he saw it was. The male figure rode the horse till reaching a field out of sight of the castle and dumped the body out of the bag followed by burying it into the field after digging a grave not marked. He found the figure holding up one of the male's fingers and with a knife chopped off a part of the middle finger and bagged it. Guardian heard horses neighing to find the figure throwing dirt onto the body and vaulted onto the horse riding it away while pocketing the bagged finger. He kept on watching as the figure rode the horse only to meet a group of riders wearing armor who swung their swords aimed at the figure as if trying to cut the male. Guardian found the male waving bare hands towards the armored males before finding his horse rearing up knocking him off as another figure appearing to be Lance Richard the God King God of the Underworld came into sight to grab the gonoid's halter. He watched as the armored males grabbed the figure into a tight ironclad hold and thrust him to kneel while yanking off his mask he gasped seeing Nikolai's face with the Source in control. Nikolai, he watched gave Lance Richard a glare who without a word took out the bagged finger from the male's pocket who gave up a spit towards the crowned male. 
He got Lance Richard speaking "Interesting Nikolai that you're desperate to destroy her enough to do what it takes to keep your son's spirit alive. Perhaps using him as a weapon to destroy her favored by your Mother despite you the oldest and heir to the throne. You're desperate to save your own son from the machinations of your pouch sister aren't you?"
Guardian exhaled a breath hearing Lance Richard's words to find Nikolai giving up another spit onto the crowned male who added speaking "I have plans for you, Nikolai, as my own son. You'll do my plans period. Forget your sister and her plans. She's just a useless female who'll be easily controlled by a male once lust strikes her-"
He found Nikolai interrupting "You don't know my sister as well as I does."
He heard the edge in Nikolai's voice tone to find Lance Richard speaking "Never mind go to sleep Nikolai."
Guardian saw Nikolai slump over as if asleep as Lance Richard tossed aside the bag holding the finger and ground it with his foot onto the grassed ground. He found a sound hitting him to frown as blackness arrived only to recall the sound as the alarm clock found he lying in bed opening his eyes lurching into a sitting position. 
Guardian found the familiar butler in the room giving him a golden eyed glare and speaking "Get up Victor for me to scan you medically."
He obeyed to stand up finding the butler scanning him via wand device followed by adding "Go attend to your hygiene and make it snappy now."
Guardian obeyed to make sure he was quick with the showering to walk out clad in a towel to find the butler thrusting him articles of clothing he put on. He discovered it was a suit twin to what he wore at his crowning as King of Mahalia but didn't include a bullet proof vest this time. 
He kept his mouth into a thin line as the butler spoke "Show me what you've been doing to your hair now."
Guardian obeyed to brush it back into a tail only to get the butler yanking the tail out and grabbing the hair brush followed by brushing his hair. 
He folded his arms with annoyance taking hold as the butler brushed his hair followed by declaring him done and telling him "Go to the dining room to take in nourishment now."
He obeyed feeling himself hungry to go to the dining room to find Olga inside holding Nicky from the looks of it with the Queen at the head of the table smirking while eating her food and taking in her drink. He sighed and went to sit down forcing himself to be slow taking his nourishment of eating and drinking only to hear a gasp sound. Guardian eyed the Queen finding her giving off another gasp and forming a pained expression on her face with eyes shut. He gave her a glare as he ate his food and drank his drink as the Queen quit the pained expression followed by resuming taking in her nourishment with her familiar smirk on her face. Guardian once done taking in his nourishment leaned back in the seat with arms folded to find the Queen had finished her nourishment. 
He eyed her warily to find the Queen speaking "Victor, come with me."
He heard the sneering voice tone of the Queen obeyed to follow her to the office she taking the desk's chair and he taking the couch as thrust to sit by a guard who kept a hand onto his shoulder. Guardian kept his mouth into a thin line as the butler arrived into the room carrying a briefcase he kept the glare to find the male was waving wands and lights into his eyes he flinched from the blaring. 
He glared at the butler who spoke after quitting the lights' glare "His eyes are permanently like that, Your Majesty. It's a result of blood getting onto his eyes and staining it with that look. There's nothing I can do to remove that look. It's permanent, Your Majesty."
Guardian heard the edge spoken in the butler's voice tone kept the glare as he heard "Give him the prosthetics for his eyes to wear on a permanent basis."
He exhaled a breath as the butler without a word opened the briefcase and yanked out objects he finding himself restrained via ironclad grip by the guards. Guardian kept the glare as the butler jabbed objects into his eyes he felt were giving him the itches. 
He ignored the urge to scratch his eyes out as the butler fiddled with his eyes followed by speaking "It's done. Their in now and can't be removed without surgical help."
Guardian sensed the butler was telling the truth as the male walked out of sight he finding the urge to scratch his eyes gone along with the itchy feeling. He gave the Queen a glare to find her forming the familiar pained expression followed by forming her familiar sneering look. 
Guardian kept his mouth into a thin line as he glared at the Queen who spoke "Now get a hold of this deity named Daisuke and give him an ultimatum. A baby implanted into my Talia for me to see her in my presence since he's unable to get her pregnant."
He kept the glare in response as the Queen sounded like she was speaking to someone but not anyone in the room as there was a light show showing Daisuke with Olivia. He found Daisuke giving off a loud hiss sound and crouching behind Olivia who did a double take look seeing the Queen her Mother. 
He kept his mouth into a thin line as the Queen spoke "Hello Talia. It's your Mother, herself."
Guardian eyed Olivia who walked away without a word only to get her progress halted by a hissing Daisuke grabbing her and forcing her to face the Queen he still hissing loudly. 
He heard loudly "Helena!"
Guardian exhaled a breath hearing the voice sounded of he using a creepy voice tone twin to Nikolai's Source voice as the Queen he saw formed a frown before speaking "Transport them both out now!"
He found Daisuke and Olivia disappearing in a light show to focus onto the Queen with a glare only to see her form shift into a black skeleton giving off raspy breathing noises. He frowned eyeing the skeleton that shifted back into the Queen she not noticing the body changes by giving off a golden eyed glare. 
Guardian kept his mouth shut as the Queen spoke loudly "You bastard brother! You had to do this to me to scare my own daughter and her husband from accepting me! No wonder Talia seemed scared of me!"
He kept the glare aimed at the Queen who gave up a loud Humph sound to hear "I'll get rid of that Guardian of Life and Death persona if I were you. It's associated with death actually Stepmother hence your Talia afraid of you."
He stiffened from his voice speaking the words to give the Queen a glare who looked in his direction with a golden eyed glare in response to get him speaking "I saw Death incarnate where you were sitting. It probably explains why Talia was afraid of you. She didn't see you in your Egyptian form but Death incarnate in the form of death to scare her."
Guardian clamped his mouth shut into a thin line to find the Queen cocking her head as if listening to something followed by slumping over groaning loudly while shaking her head. He found the skeleton tearing itself out of the Queen and darting passed him he sensing a light show from behind. 
Guardian kept his mouth into a thin line as the Queen eyed him with a golden eyed glare he found himself compelled to speak "The Guardian of Life and Death is insulted with my existence of me bearing his Egyptian face and using his name of Guardian whenever going around people including referring myself as that."
He clamped his mouth shut into a thin line to find the Queen kept the golden eyed glare he finding himself compelled to speak "I've met some male named Nikolai claiming you as his sister Helena before I landed in your lap. I'm not even sure of what's the actual story regarding this Nikolai and you. That despite having a dream of some female with your face ordering a male with my facial expression to have headed cut off."
He cut himself off when he saw the Queen formed her familiar pained expression to continue on speaking "Anyway this dream showed Nikolai or twin getting a hold of my twin's body and burying it into a field including taking a piece of the body. Some crowned male with Nikolai's face got a hold of Nikolai via force and took the body's piece off of him before putting him down unconscious. I heard this crowned male called my twin as some offspring of Nikolai's twin. It's when I woke up by the alarm clock blaring in my ear by the butler found in my sleeping room."
He clamped his mouth shut to see the Queen shake away her pained expression followed by forming a sneer and speaking "Just transport me Talia alone to me now!"
Guardian heard in response "Busy working on a problem."
He frowned hearing Tut's familiar excuse for not willing to do an order to find the door opening to show Daisuke walking into the room with the Source in control the male giving the Queen a glare. 
Guardian kept his mouth into a thin line as he eyed the Queen to find her flaring golden eyes and speaking "Daisuke, you had something to do with keeping Talia from me hmm?"
He eyed Daisuke to get from the male speaking "Don't Daisuke me, Helena."
He heard a gasp from the Queen to focus onto Daisuke as if drawn who continued on speaking "Bitch incarnate is what you are, Helena. I'll see that your light is extinguished on a permanent basis, you bitch. Don't toy with me Death incarnate and my powers, Helena. You'll pay for this insult and the price will be your daughter Talia for the insult you played onto me. Don't play me again, Helena."
Guardian eyed the Queen to sense Daisuke disappear in a light show to find the female was again displaying her familiar pained expression followed by she doing her familiar head shake and forming a sneer on her face. 
He found fear in her eyes despite her lips in a sneering look as she spoke "So get Victor schooled on how to act as King since he's clueless to this now."
He heard the fear in her voice tone kept his mouth into a thin line as he thought to himself "What's going to happen now?"
Guardian heard nothing in answer to his question.

Part ten: Chasing Dreams

Guardian lay in bed in the hotel room in Northern State feeling annoyed with his question he recalled asked himself and got no answer in response. He felt his mind scanned shifted to glare at the Queen as the familiar cauldron scene was seen in his mind. He glared as the Queen went to sit down in an armchair picking up a book and appeared to be reading it ignoring him. He found the mind scanning quit once she focused onto the book she appearing to not reading it instead had eyes shut with a pained expression on her face. Guardian grunted in response as he felt a fist punch him in the stomach to find he standing underneath a spotlight facing Mordecai punching him in the stomach.
He spoke firmly "Cuts it with the punching now!”
He glared at Mordecai who had remained silent with no visits since a visit as Daisuke to the Queen a lunar cycle ago. He kept the glare as he found Egypt appearing into view getting between Mordecai and himself. 
Guardian found Mordecai speaking "He made a deal with me that made me suffer in response to trying to get the deal's works done."
He kept the glare to find Egypt turning around pushing him backwards which he came to finding himself still lying in the hotel's bed with a hand was patting his cheek. He jerked open his eyes to glare with annoyance to find the hand's owner was the Queen looking annoyed. 
Guardian spoke in a rude tone "Something you want now since I'm trying to sleep?"
He formed a glare to get from the Queen in response "Your rest is over, Victor. Get up now."
He heard the Compeller's voice tone from the Queen didn't comment a response to get up from the bed to find guards grabbing his arms in a tight ironclad hold as the female stuck her fist into his stomach. 
He grunted from the blow as the Queen was heard while raining her fists onto his front "Blast that Daisuke for seemingly knowing what I'm up to! I knew he got Talia moved to Northern State as its dubbed but the residence where they were staying indicated no one had lived there for cycles! Wait till I get my hands onto that Daisuke for this joke-"
He interrupted "I'm not for you to use for your fists as a punching bag."
Guardian got from the Queen giving off a loud scream followed by grunting loudly as she kneed him in the sensitive part repeatedly.
He grunted out "I'm not for you to use for you anger Stepmother."
Guardian got another scream from the Queen followed by groaning loudly as she kicked him in the sensitive part with the top of her heeled shoe. He sagged into the grips of the guards from the pain then felt relief when the Queen went to sit down in the armchair and resume reading her book. He didn't comment a response as the guards roughhouse got him back onto the bed and forced him to lie down. Guardian shut his eyes in response forcing he to rest from the pain despite itching to rub a hand over his sensitive part through his pants. He felt the urge get too much rubbed a hand onto his sensitive part through the pants while groaning loudly.
He heard "The nerve of that idiot like father like son."
Guardian frowned hearing the Queen's comment sighed once his sensitive part quit stinging in pain and removed his hand to roll onto his side and curled into a ball keeping his eyes shut. He heard the phone ringing felt a hand shaking him awake which he jerked open his eyes to find a guard thrusting him the phone's mouth piece while keeping the ear part away from him.
Guardian recalled his teachings as King spoke "Yes?"
He heard the firmness of his voice to hear "Helena, my dear."
He heard the Queen gasping loudly as the creepy voice of some male with Source in control continued speaking "I'll give up pursuing Talia if I were you. If you keep it up I'll see that she's removed from Mahalia on the permanent basis. Give up the chase now Helena."
Guardian felt compelled to speak spoke "Go to the depths brother dear."
He felt annoyed with what he spoke to hear from the voice on the line seeing a guard making a circle motion with a finger to notice another guard onto a laptop computer "Interesting."
Guardian opened his mouth only to hear the dial tone in his ear focused onto the guard on the laptop that spoke loudly "Signal was tracked pinging all over the planet. It's indicating it was transmitted via satellite onto our location not using the hotel's operators this time. He's probably trying to hide his location at the moment but it'll take awhile before I can get the Eli to follow the trail and pinpoint his location."
He kept his mouth into a thin line to eye the Queen who formed a glare and spoke "Interesting brother dear. I will find you no matter the cost."
He exhaled a breath hearing the Queen's words to find the guards forcing him to lie down again which he obeyed and got his eyes forced shut. He found his pains quit bothering him to sleep dreamlessly till the sound of a phone ringing jarred him awake. Guardian found the guards getting him into a sitting position and thrusting the phone onto him he was speaking his familiar comment. 
He heard in response "Typical that you would try to find me, Helena. I had an ulterior motive on keeping Talia away from you. You killed my son who Victor's face is twin to. Don't deny that."
He heard the dial tone in his ear as he felt a compulsion to speak spoke "Blast you-"
Guardian got his mouth covered in response along with the compulsion to speak gone from him glared at the Queen who was again displaying her pained expression. 
He found the hand remove itself spoke in response "What else am I supposedly to be doing other than playing games with this brother of yours, Stepmother?"
He glared at the Queen who didn't answer his question as he found himself ignored to grumble loudly ignoring he was speaking out loud "This isn't what I had in mind."
Guardian heard nothing in answer to his complaint kept the glare aimed at the Queen. Guardian found himself relieved to be back into the King's residence in the yard playing a game of basketball with Olga. This time it involved just throwing the ball into the basket from a standing spot. 
He found Olga's throwing seemed erratic and missing the basket which he spoke "You're upset about something, Olga."
Guardian found Olga halted her throwing to speak giving him an all red eyed glare "My Mother is obsessed with meeting my sister Talia despite objections from advisors. She's left you to run things while she runs all over Mahalia for any sighting of Talia just to meet her. She's neglecting Nicky and me at the moment."
He sighed and threw the ball into the basket to see it swish in and found Olga's next shot going in which he spoke "I thought she wanted to rule Mahalia underneath her thumb. I guess I'm wrong to think of that."
Guardian got from Olga growling out "She's like a kid obsessed with the latest toy enough to be obsessed with it then once she gets what's she wants she loses interests into it enough to get into it again once its made shiny and new to her. Its same feeling shared with our Father at the moment something I haven't inherited myself."
He frowned to hear a loud Tsk sound halting his throwing to find the butler in vicinity speaking "Excuse me Your Majesty and Madam Olga but I'm told to inform you that Her Majesty has left the residence abruptly without saying where she was going. Besides I'll come again when its time for both of you to be in bed."
He saw the butler walk away which he focused onto Olga who snarled "It's our Father locked up in a lunatic asylum being lucid again. Something my Mother has to go to whenever lucidity strikes just to keep him a lunatic and keep him contained. Only she using her Compeller's voice can keep our Father believing he's crazy enough to remain locked up. Nothing I can do about it at all."
Guardian frowned feeling a cold feeling going away from his chest as Olga and him wound up resuming shooting baskets. He and Olga kept it up lengthy till the wind blew knocking aside their balls. 
He sighed and spoke "I think its cue to go inside probably a spinner storm."
Guardian got from Olga in response as the winds blew harder "That's just Father fighting the lunacy trick Mother is pulling onto him. He habitually causes a wind storm to blow whenever Mother is using the Compeller's voice talent onto him. I recognize his handiwork."
Guardian spoke as he and Olga paused from throwing feeling the winds blow harder "Wind storm? What talent does our Father seem to have anyway?"
He eyed Olga who spoke in response as the winds died down abruptly "He can make the winds blow over the residence whenever Mother is using her Compeller's voice trick onto him doesn't matter where he and Mother are within Mahalia which the winds will blow over the residence as always."
Guardian frowned to hear a familiar Tsk sound to find the butler in view that spoke "Excuse me you're both wanted inside for lockdown status to happen for security reasons. Her Majesty left a message saying that she won't be in residence tonight but may return the next day when it's appropriate for her to do within security clears it."
He heard Olga groaning in response as he dropped the basketball and followed her following the butler into the residence to groan once the lights in the hallway went out. He found Olga turn into a white figure that stopped walking and went up to him taking his arm he didn't resist. He found various people forming moving white figured blobs in vicinity of his eyesight despite surrounded by darkness as Olga was sensed getting him to his familiar bedroom. 
Guardian found Olga speaking once they were inside the bedroom "Nothing you can do except going to bed. The wind storm must have triggered a power outage to hit the residence hence the lights off at the moment. Good night, Victor."
He sighed finding her white blobbed figured form leaving him he hearing the door slam to blindly feel his way to the bed and forced himself to lie onto it shutting his eyes. 
Guardian heard a loud Humph sound sounding in Egypt's voice tone jerked open his eyes to discover himself standing facing a set of steps and found Mordecai sideways facing him. Mordecai, he saw was glaring at Egypt flapping her wings in fast movement over a scale that was tipping back and forth. 
He groaned softly to get Mordecai giving him a narrowed eyed glare in response followed by the male speaking "Desperate times call for desperate measures-"
He interrupted "Why don't you just let your sister Helena-"
Guardian was interrupted "I have no sister named Helena!'
He glared at Mordecai who added hearing Egypt hissing loudly "My life as Mordecai pouch brother of Helena ceased to exist. I'm now the Guardian of Life and Death. I am Death incarnate-"
Guardian interrupted "Spare me that talk Mordecai."
He glared at Mordecai who in a fast speed move was in front of him grabbing his armpits and thrusting him up to dangle his feet the male heard growling loudly. 
Guardian kept the glare as he found Mordecai speaking "Never call me by the name of Mordecai again."
He found himself lowered down then pushed backwards to fall landing onto his bed hearing the familiar alarm clock blaring its noises in a loud jarring tone. He rolled over groaning loudly only to feel a hand shaking his shoulder in an insisting moves.
Guardian opened his eyes to find the butler there that spoke "You have duties to attend to Your Majesty."
He heard the firmness of the butler's voice tone groaned and got up going into the bathroom. He made sure he was short in cleaning himself in the shower and found the butler left a new suit of clothes on his bed he finding his original ones he left on the bathroom's sink counter gone. 
Guardian got into the suit he finding it twin to what Nikolas habitually worn to think to himself "Somebody is playing a game with the Queen and is using me as a game piece."
He heard nothing in response to his thought went back into the bathroom to brush his hair finding his eye implants had changed from Egyptian blue colored to Egyptian black colored. Guardian found his efforts to put his hair into a tail thwarted by the butler who yanked the hair brush from him and brushed his hair in a fast speed move before voice ordering him out. He found himself compelled to go to the dining room obeyed to find Olga there holding Nicky that did a double take look seeing him along with seeing her sipping her drink in her free hand in a fast move.
Guardian spoke "Don't tell me your Mother is still obsessed with our Father hence me groomed to look twin to him."
He sat down to eat his food finding Olga kept on sipping her drink till once consumed got her speaking "Nope on that Victor. I suspect its our Father's influence during lucidity at the lunatic asylum enough to get the staff members to do his orders to play a game with my Mother. Oof she won't take it good when she sees you. Oh well."
He ignored Olga to continue on taking in his food and drink and once done went to the office to sit on the couch as thrust to sit by the guards. He folded his arms with a glare on his face glaring at the doors to the office's entrance to find the Queen darting inside with a golden eyed glare that did a double take look seeing him. 
Guardian felt a compulsion to bare his teeth obeyed snapping them at the Queen's direction who snarled "Whose sick idea of a joke to have Victor being a Nikolas wannabe?!"
He kept his mouth into a thin line covering his teeth to find no one answered the Queen's question to glare at her as she went to sit down at the desk. 
He shifted to glare at her as the Queen spoke "Report!"
Guardian found the same old story involving the staff members reporting only to hear from a guard "There was an unexplained power outage hitting the residence for unexplained reasons last night. We were unable to find out why but-"
The guard was interrupted "Son of a bitch that bastard!"
Guardian narrowed his eyes into a glare hearing the Queen's outburst to find the guard speaking ignoring her ranting her words repeatedly "The power outage last night was revealed to be an inside job of someone turning off the electricity. We're still running recordings to figure out who did this stunt in question enough to get them into the brig."
He found the Queen displaying a golden eyed look and he found himself compelled to speak spoke "I had nothing to do with that stunt. I was in the entrance's hallway when the lights went out with Olga escorting me to my bedroom. She told me to go to bed. We both were out on the lawn playing basketball of shooting the ball into the basket and talking on whatever come to mind just prior to getting inside."
Guardian clamped his mouth into a thin line only to feel compelled to bare his teeth obeyed snapping them aimed at the Queen who quit the golden eyed look to repeat her familiar question involving a Nikolas wannabe. 
He kept the glare as a staff member was heard "Your Majesty, you've appeared too forgotten who fathered Victor."
He found the staff member cutting herself off when the Queen gave her glare.
He kept glaring at the Queen to find her speaking "Alright Victor quit looking at me like that. Send for the doctor to fix his eyes' implants. I want them back to the blue look status. I don't want to be reminded of Victor being like Nikolas despite my miserable excuse of a husband fathering him."
Guardian exhaled a breath to find the guards restraining him as the butler arrived into view to pick onto his eyes. 
He kept the glare as the butler replaced his eyes' implants followed by speaking "Anything else, Your Majesty?"
Guardian heard the edge in the butler's voice tone that reminded him of sarcasm to find the Queen forming her familiar concentration look on her face while eyeing the butler. He shifted to eye the butler to find the male fading from view in a fast speed only to hear grunting and groaning sounds off his left. He looked to find the guards had their hands onto the butler and hauled him to the Queen whose concentration look remained followed by her flaring golden eyes.
Guardian got from the Queen "You bastard! It was you who played this sick joke of Nikolas wannabe onto Victor in question! Guards take this servant away and have him executed of having his head cut off immediately!"
He found the guards hauling the butler out of the room leaving him alone with the staff and the Queen as the door was slammed shut. He found the Queen giving him a familiar golden eyed look found his speaking compulsion refused to hit him. Guardian kept his mouth shut into a thin line as the Queen kept glaring at him with her golden eyes. He ignored throat clearing noises sounding in the room to keep silent till he heard a faint alarm sound he recognized as the Eli registering someone assassinated on the grounds. Guardian kept his mouth into a thin line as the guards were sensed back into the room by one's familiar hand onto his shoulder keeping him onto the couch. 
He found a guard speaking Compeller's voice tones "Victor, you will talk on what you know regarding this servant the butler playing a Nikolas wannabe joke onto the Queen."
Guardian found he not compelled to speak instead kept his mouth shut as the guard kept up his Compeller's voice order finding it refused to take effect onto him. 
He leaned back into the couch folding his arms only to hear from the Queen "Blast that servant. I should have realized what he was trying to keep me from learning by that insulting talk sounding in his mind when I mind scanned him. He compelled ordered Victor to be immune to Compeller voice orders take that order back now guards."
He heard silence from the guards in response to hear loud ahem sounds sounding within the room to frown finding the Queen rolling her eyes and focusing onto a guard.
He found her speaking "Don't tell me you did that head chopping literally?"
Guardian heard groans from the guards in response to get from the Queen "Blast it. This will ruin everything."
He glared at the Queen who focused onto him with eyes narrowed before cocking her head and then spoke "Hmm, I know what will get Victor to be a willing puppet. Get Victor out of the room now!"
He found the guards obeying to get him out of the room into the hallway while slamming the door in his face. Guardian grunted to hear a familiar Tsk sound to find the butler standing next to him alive and not having head chopped off to his shock. He stared at the butler that made a gesture for him to follow which he obeyed. He found the butler leading the way to outside to a sedan with black tinted windows and looking sinister creepy him out. He got ordered to get inside by the butler which he obeyed finding the servant disappearing in a light show. Guardian looked around the vehicle finding the driver's side was blocked out by blackness he unable to see who was driving him as he peered out the window seemingly lengthy. He found the vehicle driving through Victoria State only to reach a road he saw led to an insane asylum to feel confusion hitting him to why he was being sent there. Guardian frowned as the sedan arrived to the asylum's parking lot to find guards arriving to yank the door open and ordered him out using Compeller's voice tones. He obeyed to follow the guards a lengthy maze sensing he spied on to find them halting once they reached a door finding it sliding open to hear a loud roaring noise. Guardian grimaced hearing the noise sounded of his Father to him. He walked into the room to find his Father Nikolas leaning against the padded wall wearing a straitjacket around his upper body and growling loudly. He kept his mouth shut waiting for his Father to acknowledge him to find the male's black eyes focused onto him with recognition. 
Guardian kept his mouth into a thin line as his Father spoke "Interesting. So what have the bitch been up to hmm?"
He found himself compelled to talk found himself relaying what he and Olga talked about while throwing basketballs at the basket. He kept his mouth into a thin line once done talking to find his Father giving off hysterical laughter in a crazy voice tone before clearing his throat.
Guardian eyed his Father who spoke "You're not just my son but this Mordecai's son as well."
He inhaled a breath to speak only to feel a hand on his arm to find a familiar guard from the palace there as his Father rammed himself into the wall while hysterically laughing. He groaned and didn't say a word in response left the cell with the guard following him to find himself led to a limo and got inside. Guardian found the Queen seated inside the limo giving him a frown but not flaring golden eyes. 
He spoke "My Father had some lucidity when he and I talked but became crazy in front of me."
He clamped his mouth into a thin line and eyed the Queen who formed a pained expression on her face before opening her eyes and speaking "Alright, I admit it. I do still love your Father at the moment. It's a love that is hard for me to drop. I'm still at the moment trying to forgive him for your creation. I do admit its jealousy talking when I refer to the woman who bore you actually. I just feel various ranges of emotions all over the place when I see you including that you came to exist via another instead of me."
Guardian sensed her words were the truth and genuine didn't comment a response instead kept his mouth shut. 
He spoke firmly after a lengthy silence to feel the vehicle driving into Victoria State "With due respects is the reason why you display this facial expression of pain related to your various emotions all over the place?"
He clamped his mouth shut while eyeing the Queen to get her speaking in response after displaying a familiar expression "That and reminders of painful times I had with your father."
He heard the familiar tone in her voice that indicted that she lied didn't press the matter further instead stared out the window seemingly lengthy. Guardian felt himself sleepy leaned against a guard to feel the male inject him with a syringe which he passed out unconscious to come to finding himself lying on the ground. He found himself lying on top of the car door while hearing a roaring noise of an eater explosion behind him. He looked behind him to discover the limo was engulfed in eater and at the bottom of a ravine where he was lying next to it. Guardian got up feeling himself annoyed with the Queen only to see darkness surrounding him and the inferno. He found Mordecai walking into view speaking his familiar line while showing scales behind the male. Guardian found Egypt floating behind Mordecai an annoyed expression on her face. 
He formed a glare while glaring at Mordecai to speak "Your desperate to kill me aren't you?"
Guardian glared at Mordecai who didn't say a word in response instead addressed Egypt "Remove this trash from my presence now!"
He found Egypt pushing him backwards to come to finding himself lying on a car door hearing an explosion sound. He grunted annoyed sound to get up shaking his head and looked at the limo bursting in fire in the bottom of the ravine with him. Guardian found himself alone while standing facing the inferno. He forced himself to climb the hill to the road which he collapsed into a kneeling pose once reaching the road to find ambulances and police cars there parked. He heard shouts of surprise to find medics and cops attending to him by getting him into an ambulance and putting an oxygen mask over his face and he passed out unconscious.

Guardian woke up with a start to feel a cat tummy sitting on his front purring vibrations going through him. He jerked open his eyes to find the cat an orange ball of fur stand up on four paws arching its back. Guardian stared at the cat warily who gave up a soft mew sound before giving off a loud ear splitting yowl which he grimaced from the yowling. He grimaced groaning only to find the cat yanked off of him by Nikolai who got the gonoid out of the room and returned giving him an all white eyed glare. 
Guardian kept his mouth shut as Nikolai spoke "Talk on what you and this Nikolas talked while at that lunatic asylum."
He heard the creepy voice of Mordecai from Nikolai spoke it entirely including repeating his Father's comment regarding himself as the son of him and Mordecai. 
Guardian kept his mouth into a thin line as Nikolai shook away Mordecai's Mordecai’s entire white eyed look and spoke with blue eyes "And what else do you remember happened next other than you survived this car explosion?"
He spoke firmly "I wound up meeting stepmother in the limo and falling asleep followed by drugged and then woke up finding myself out of the car while it was in an eater explosion from the looks of it. I managed to force myself to walk to the road to get medical help."
He clamped his mouth shut to find Nikolai looking away from him displaying his all white eyed look he noticing Egypt floating next to the male who was appearing to be staring at her. 
Guardian frowned as he heard "Have you forgotten your own son that your sister killed and your feelings towards him?"
He frowned hearing that question from Egypt to focus onto Nikolai he figured was Mordecai himself who didn't move his mouth when speaking.
Guardian instead heard Nikolai mentally blasting in his mind "Don't remind me of this Egypt!"
He frowned further as Egypt spoke while glaring at Nikolai "Don't deny it that you loved your son too much enough to want him to live again."
Guardian kept his mouth shut as Nikolai looked away displaying the Source through and got the male's creepy voice speaking through his mind "Yes, I know of that love actually. My sister wound up knowing what's its like to have a child of her own when she got implanted with Olga. Humph too bad my sister didn't share her love of me being her sibling towards me. I loved my sister but she didn't love me back. Instead she did whatever she could do to spite me including beheading my own son. She even got Lance Richard to believe her lies of me being a drunkard, a whore, and a thief and got the Deity to get me as disciple complete with his power uses."
Guardian spoke as Nikolai paused "You sure that she was thinking of you to have something special despite your Mother's feelings towards her?"
He got Nikolai holding up a hand and felt himself choking only to get from Egypt "Don't you dare choke my son when he's right on what he said. You didn't have anything mental power wise till that Deity Lance Richard gave you them and made you a disciple of him."
He sighed to breathe feeling the choking quit which he sighed while eyeing Nikolai who displayed an all white eyed look this time and turning around he spotted the Queen standing in the doorway alive with a golden eyed glare.
Guardian exhaled a breath as Nikolai was heard "So the bitch incarnate Queen Svetlana herself decided to grace me with her presence. Nice."
He exhaled another breath hearing Nikolai's creepy voice tone indicating of using the Source in control to get the Queen entering the room slamming the door.
The Queen spoke "You bastard! I should have known that you were behind Victor coming to existence! I got it straight from the hospital that you did something screwy around to create Victor! Don't deny it your bastard son of a bitch!"
Nikolai he heard spoke despite the Queen using a Compeller's voice tone "Insults. Hmm you've gone to insulting me hmm? Where's your manners Svetlana?"
Guardian sat up eyeing the Queen warily to find her speaking "Victor, get up and throw yourself out the window now!"
He found himself compelled to get up only to halt when feeling paralysis hitting his feet once he was in front of the window. 
Guardian heard "So the bitch is desperate to destroy Victor such as that car explosion which his system was tested and he indicated on being drugged."
He again got the Queen's familiar order only to crawl onto the floor towards the window which he felt paralysis hitting his body from the neck down. 
Guardian kept his form still while struggling to breathe only to hear "Admit it you bastard that you love Victor enough to see him as your own son hence you keeping him alive!"
He breathed through his nose hearing the Queen's words as he heard "Does it matter on keeping him alive?"
Guardian heard from the Queen in response "You will pick up Victor and throw him out the window and make sure his light is extinguished."
He heard in response "I wouldn't be doing that stunt if I were you. I prefer to toss you out the window instead of doing it to Victor."
Guardian felt himself no longer paralysis to swing himself up in a fast move to stand giving the Queen a glare. 
He found the Queen still displaying golden eyes that spoke "You're Mordecai my brother!"
Guardian exhaled a breath to get from Nikolai in response "Interesting conclusion of calling me by that word of Mordecai whatever it is and accusing me as your brother. You know I'm not you, bitch."
Guardian eyed the Queen to get from her speaking in response "Stop denying it Mordecai. I can tell that you're my brother from seeing the memory clearly in your mind from mind scanning you."
He heard Nikolai hiss loudly followed by the male speaking "Ah Helena so we meet again. Too bad Mother favored you with her blessings instead of letting me have anything I wanted despite me the heir to the throne."
He frowned as the Queen quit the golden eyed look and formed a pleading expression on her face he frowning to see. 
Guardian frowned as the Queen spoke "Mordecai please-"
She was interrupted he heard "Mordecai is dead since Abydos dissolved. I call myself Nikolai now. Don't dredge up the past, Helena. Leave it buried where it should be."
He frowned while eyeing the Queen who kept the pleading followed by the female speaking "Nikolai please let me see Talia."
He exhaled a breath to get from Nikolai in response "So Talia is the name you're referring to her now despite she calls herself some other name. Nice try with your begging Helena. You know that won't work on me. You've forgotten what you did to my son do you hmm?"
He frowned eyeing the Queen who kept the pleading followed by her speaking "Nikolai then prove it that you don't care for Victor by letting him throw himself out the window. I'll quit my begging on seeing Talia if you do this for me."
Guardian got Nikolai giving off a loud growl sounding of Mordecai to him making him nervous seeing the Queen take a step back with fear on her face seen. He saw her appear to keep the fearful look as Nikolai marched up to her while putting a gloved hand onto her chin she averting her eyes from looking at the male. 
Guardian heard from Nikolai "I don't have to prove myself to you, you bitch. You killed my son. I haven't forgotten that incident, Helena. Don't try to kill, Victor. I made an oath to Nikolas your husband that I would keep him alive for him. You can ask Nikolas your husband on this if you want. He'll confirm this oath I made with my life."
He heard the voice tone of Nikolai indicating the male was lying to find Egypt floating next to the male who he heard spoke "He's your son Nikolai as you wish to be called."
Guardian heard nothing from Nikolai in response to Egypt's comment instead found the male releasing the Queen and stepping around her going to the door and opening it and walking out with the door slamming hard with a bang sound. He grimaced from the bang sound of the door only to hear a faint thump onto the door to frown as the Queen gave up a loud Humph sound while seeing she had a smirk on her face. 
Guardian spoke "What did you do this time Stepmother?"
He glared at the Queen who noticed him standing quit the smirk and formed a pained grimace followed by hearing a door knocking sound of three knocks. He frowned as the Queen still grimacing went to the door and yanked it open to find Nikolai grabbing the female by the neck and lifting her up choking loudly. 
He heard from Nikolai speaking as the Queen appeared to be clawing the male's hand onto her throat "Bitch, I should kill you anyway!"
He saw a palace guard behind Nikolai in a fast speed move inject the male with a syringe followed by the man dropping the Queen onto the floor who gasped loudly. 
He frowned as Nikolai collapsed onto the floor he hearing from the male blaring in his mind "Egypt is desperate to keep you alive, Victor, hence she making a bargain with my sister to destroy me."
Guardian frowned as Nikolai appeared to fall unconscious without hearing another word from him to find the Queen getting up awkwardly and looking at Egypt as if she could see the female. 
He stiffened as the Queen looked away with disgust on her face followed by speaking "Guards get Nikolai to the palace and into the brig now!"
Guardian found guards coming into the room picking up an unconscious Nikolai to find the Queen giving off a smirk making his senses blaring warning abruptly. 
He stiffened as the Queen spoke in a Compeller's voice "Victor, you will throw yourself out the window."
"No!" Guardian heard from Egypt.
Guardian heard hysterical laughter from the Queen as he obeyed to her Compeller's order throwing he out the window while hearing an alarm sound. Guardian found himself falling towards the road only to feel claws grab him onto his shoulders where his hospital gown was. He felt the claws belonged to Ryder Hawk grabbed the gonoid's legs and kept a tight hold as the gonoid flew in the air still clinging to him. Guardian found Ryder Hawk flying lengthy he finding the gonoid flying around before letting go of him which he obeyed to fell into a body of water. Guardian swam up to the surface to find a life raft thrown to him which he caught and got towed to the shore. He found the owner of the lift raft was Daisuke from the looks of him who appeared to look angry to him. 
Guardian didn't say a word while shivering from the cold of snow falling around him to find Daisuke speaking with the Source in control "Come along now."
He obeyed to walk in the snow while shivering to figure that he was in Republic State to find the city of Yekaterinburg in view finding Daisuke walking lengthy ignoring him pestering the male with questions. Guardian followed Daisuke to find the male leading to Daria Mustafina's street address to find the male stopping in front of a house not Daria's and walking up to the door waving a hand. He found the doors opening followed by a cat walking out to get onto Daisuke's shoulder giving off a loud meow in a friendly tone. He sighed and followed Daisuke inside to find Olivia from the looks of her entering the living room with a frown. Guardian saw recognition form in Olivia's eyes seeing him as he didn't say a word as Olivia got him into the kitchen to eat food and gave him clothes he recognized as his from staying at Daria's house. Guardian sighed feeling himself much better from the nourishment and clothes on his form and feeling the heat of the house to frown finding Olivia sitting across him in a chair. He saw the frown on her face but recognized the questioning look in her eyes.
Guardian spoke "Something you want to know?"
He found Daisuke no where in sight along with the cat he sensed neither one were staring from a hiding place.
Guardian frowned as Olivia spoke "Your my brother Victor and King of Mahalia."
He sighed hearing Olivia's comment was a statement and not a question spoke firmly "Yes I'm what you said. Besides your Mother wants to meet you."
He clamped his mouth into a frown as Olivia spoke "I know of that desire to meet me. Days told me but have been balking on explaining why we keep on moving all over the place."
Guardian opened his mouth only to feel a choking feeling in his throat to find Daisuke in the room with the cat on his shoulder. 
He clamped his mouth shut as Olivia spoke "Days admit it you don't want me to meet my Mother hence this ridiculous moving all over the place."
He found himself able to breathe to give Daisuke a glare to find the male speaking "I already met your Mother multiple times. She creepy me out enough to want to avoid her. I refused to have you be scared of her despite her scaring me. I figured once I'm over being scared of her is when you can meet her but she still scares me at the moment."
Guardian heard the doorbell ringing frowned as Daisuke formed a fearful expression on his face followed by the male speaking "Olivia, go answer the door. Your Mother is here to meet you. I can sense her at the door at the moment."
Guardian frowned but remained seated as Olivia went out of the kitchen to hear a shriek sounding of Egypt's voice followed by hearing a door slam. He frowned as Daisuke kneeled rocking his form and crying tears and looking upset. Guardian didn't say a word in response went out of the kitchen to the living room to find Olivia not in sight with the door shut. He went to the door to peer through the peephole to find a sinister sedan peeling away in a fast move through the street ignoring other cars driving by some drivers seen waving fists aimed at the vehicle. He opened the door and peered outside finding Olivia no where in sight but found a book on the porch's floor which he picked up to look only to get it yanked from his hand. 
Guardian found Daisuke standing next to him that threw the book into the house followed by the male speaking "Come with me. You should be home in Victoria State. I need to get you to the airport and help pay for your ticket since you don't seem to have any money."
He exhaled a breath to find Daisuke dumping the cat outside that gave up a loud yowl and shutting both doors locking it followed by following the male walking in a brisk pace to the bridge leading to Yekaterinburg. He frowned as a limo stopped by them followed by Daisuke hiding behind him with hands gripping his sides and hearing the male hissing loudly. Guardian found the Queen getting out displaying a golden eyed look making him gulp to find her gesturing him to get into the vehicle. He found Daisuke throwing himself off the bridge to find a Ryder Hawk catching the male and flying away in a fast speed move. Guardian went into the limo to sit facing the Queen to find her questioning him on meeting Olivia and her residence. He didn't comment a response as the limo drove to Olivia's house only to see it erupt in a huge fireball which the limo drove away instead of stopping in front of it. 
Guardian got the Queen speaking "Talk Victor on what happened to Talia now!"
He spoke firmly "I found her gone from the residence after her husband had her answer the doorbell."
He frowned as the Queen spoke "What else did you see, Victor?"
Guardian spoke "I saw a sedan with black tinted windows giving me the creeps driving away from the residence in a fast speed move aggravating fellow drivers."
Guardian clamped his mouth into a thin line to get the Queen snarling "You bastard Mordecai did this stunt to me!"
He exhaled a breath to find the Queen speaking gibberish sounding like she was angry to him. He kept his mouth shut to look away out the window to find the limo arriving to the bridge to park followed by the guards forcing him out. Guardian felt annoyance take hold as the guards got him over the edge of the bridge towards the raging maelstrom waters below and dropped him. Guardian groaned as he felt claws of a Ryder Hawk catch him followed by flying seemingly lengthy following the raging river only to drop him onto the deck of a boat. He found himself forced to stand by hands grabbing him to find himself restrained by the two familiar vampires to find them growling while baring fanged teeth aimed at him. Guardian stiffened as the vampires placed hands onto his chest he feeling dizziness and choking feeling. He choked as he felt pain from his throat that felt like pricks of bites he recalled what it was. Guardian heard a sucking sound from the biting sensation from his throat. He gagged as the sensation quit followed by licking felt then felt himself not long dizzy but sick in his stomach. Guardian kept his mouth shut as the vampires he figured fed off him hauled him onto the edge of the boat's deck and proceeded to toss him off into the water. He felt himself sleepy and unable to reach the surface heard a roaring noise sounding familiar along with hearing the word No repeated. Guardian felt himself passing out unconscious.

Part Eleven: Machinations

Guardian came to dreaming of Helena walking into a prison from the looks of stone walls to enter a jail cell while escorted with guards. Helena had torches lighted in the jail cell she having a glare on her face. Helena glared at a male chained sitting on the floor looking like he was asleep to her. 
She glared as she spoke "Wake him up now!"
Her order got obeyed by the guards dumping a pail of dirty water onto the male's face that woke up with a glare with blue eyes despite the hair black covering most of the face. 
Helena leaned forwards speaking "Hello Mordecai. Something you should be doing other than drinking yourself drunk enough to get the townsfolk to toss you out? Tell me why I should spare your life now!"
Mordecai spoke in response "Oh just have me fell onto my sword and be done with my life sister dear."
Helena spoke in response after straightening up her form "Mordecai drinking yourself drunk isn't the way to live brother dear. Think of something else now."
Mordecai got up despite the guards baring their swords the male snarling "Mother favored you, Helena, with the crown despite me the heir to the throne! I was born first! I should have been crowned King! Instead Mother favored you and got Father to die so she could give you the crown of Abydos! Don't deny it Helena! You killed Mother and my son Mordecai so you could have the throne to yourself!"
Helena walked up towards Mordecai and slapped him onto the cheek the male growling an angry sound in response.
Helena spoke "I'll see that the Deity Lord Lance Richard will punish you once the time arrives! Guards knock him out now!"
Mordecai kept up the growling the male displaying an all black eyed look as guards hit him on the head with the butt of their swords the male going unconscious in front of them. Guardian grunted from a fist hitting his stomach he finding himself chained again from his dream. He wound up to jerk open his eyes finding himself back in the King's residence in the gym room as a guard punched him. He glared at the Queen standing in sight with a golden eyed glare. Guardian spoke the dream fully to see the Queen form a pained expression on her face followed by forming a glare aimed at him. 
He glared at the Queen in response as she spoke "Alright enough of the fisting now!"
He found the guard quit to his relief to find himself urged to free himself obeyed breaking off the chains. Guardian heard gun cocking noises ignored it to fold his arms glaring at the Queen who formed a glare in response. 
Guardian glared as the Queen spoke "What special ability do you have involving freeing yourself, Victor?"
He heard the firmness of her voice not using the Compeller in control heard from Egypt in response "Queen Bitch! It’s me doing this stunt."
Guardian found the Queen looking pass him he sensing Egypt behind him by the noise of her flapping wings sounding. 
He ignored Egypt to focus onto the Queen who shifted to look at him followed by her speaking "Alright have the samples been taken from Nikolas and Victor, doctor?"
He found the familiar butler walking into view that spoke "Yes, the samples have been taken from Nikolas and sent to the hospital. Samples are already done on, Victor, when he was hospitalized. They'll send the results over once their done with the tests. They'll be sure to let you know where Victor was born according to tests saved for each baby born in Mahalia."
Guardian recalled the midwife's job spoke firmly "You sure that the hospital kept records for each baby? I was raised by a midwife who helped females’ birth babies at home. There was nothing to indicate of a test done onto the females and their babies when they had them at home."
He clamped his mouth shut to hear ahem sound loudly followed by the Queen walking up towards him till an arm length away and giving him a glare. He glared back feeling himself not afraid of the Queen as she glared back onto him.
Guardian kept the glare as the Queen spoke "The midwife's job was to get samples from the babies she did via the cords and baby attachment carriers. She had them sent to hospitals to keep records of the females and their babies. Also the hospitals kept records of the females coming into there claiming some pregnancy status and wanting that confirmed. They did samples onto the females and samples onto the babies. A hospital will probably have tested you for matching you with your Father after your Mother birthed you at her home and not hospitalized as thought. The results are there in their records. I will find out what the results are period."
Guardian spoke in response as the Queen paused "Are you desperate to prove something, Stepmother?'
He glared at the Queen who formed a pained expression on her face followed by turning around and walking out of the room followed by two of the guards. He found the butler standing giving off a Tsk sound which he glared at the male.
The butler spoke "Excuse me, Your Majesty but this isn't the proper room for you to sleep in. Go to your bedroom and get some rest now."
He obeyed without a comment and went to the teenaged boy room to get onto the bed shutting his eyes. Only to hear a meow along with pressures onto his front which he jerked open his eyes to discover a cat sitting on him. Guardian frowned as the cat tummy sat giving off purring vibrations which he sighed and shut his eyes lulled to sleepiness. He came to hearing the alarm clock blaring in his ear groaned to feel a cat's paw patting his face along with multiple meowing sounds. He sighed and opened his eyes to discover the cat was sitting on his front patting his face. He eyed the alarm clock to discover it was four o'clock in the morning to his confusion despite the darkness of the room. Guardian sensed himself stared at he figured was from the cat only to find a white blobbed figure walk into view in the darkness he eyed warily. 
Guardian frowned as the figure walked up towards him and heard "How many fingers am I holding up?"
He found the voice belonged to the butler and held up two fingers the male was holding up. 
Guardian opened his mouth to speak only to get the butler covering it and speaking "The test is to make sure the implants are working fine. So go back to sleep now. You look like you could use the rest. Excuse the cat."
Guardian shut his eyes as the butler forced him to lie down to dream of Mordecai speaking "Olga managed to get her Mother to agree to have the cat in residence to prey on the mouser gonoid problem. Olga was rather put out by that the staff would be using poison onto the residence to kick out the mousers. She used Nicky as an excuse to have no poisoning done and have the cat do the job. Her mother agreed for Nicky's sake her recalling her childhood residence in Abydos having cats galore to prey onto the mousers."
Guardian opened his mouth to speak only to hear a loud meow sounding loudly to look off his right as Mordecai did the same to find a female with a cat's head crouching onto her feet and wearing a white dress with a crown on her head. 
He exhaled a breath to get from Mordecai "Interesting High Priestess. You got Olga to fall for your charms enough to get one of your disciples into Victor's residence didn't you?"
He frowned as the female spoke in a hissing voice "Acknowledge that Victor is your son now Mordecai-"
Mordecai interrupt "Egypt got you to speak her cause. Humph-"
Guardian found Mordecai interrupted "I can only help you as far as I can Guardian. It's up to you to get the help you need."
He heard the familiar meow followed by an alarm clock blaring to come to finding he lying in bed with the cat still sitting on his front. He groaned from the alarm clock only to feel the cat patting his face and meowing loudly in an insisting tone. Guardian jerked opened his eyes to find sunlight streaming through the window despite the blinds open. He looked at the clock to see the time was eight o'clock in the morning. Guardian groaned as the cat rubbed its face onto his chin and gave him several licks while meowing in pleading tones. He sighed and forced himself to get up after the cat got off his front which he went into the bathroom while hearing the door to the bedroom open. He ignored the noise to shower quickly and walked out of the bathroom finding the butler there that had laid clothes onto the bed. Guardian got dressed into his clothes he finding wasn't his Father's style instead was something else and no bullet proof vest. He didn't protest as the butler brushed his hair for him followed by declaring him done. Guardian walked out followed by the butler giving off his familiar Tsk sound.
He halted to glare at the butler who spoke "Dining room. You need nourishment."
He obeyed finding the butler leading the way to find Olga inside holding Nicky who was cooing away. He found Olga sipping from a cup appearing to look brown and alcoholic to him. Guardian sat down and took in his nourishment including drinking the drink he finding his senses again blaring warning. 
He grunted an annoyed sound once done drinking the orange juice to lean back in the chair only to hear "Shouldn't you be in the office?" 
Guardian sighed hearing Olga's voice and comment got up finding the butler next to him. He found the butler leading the way to the office which inside he found the Queen seated a glare on her face. 
Guardian found himself forced to sit on the couch as he heard "About time you arrived, Victor. You wasted my patience by refusing to wake up from some sleeping status since six o'clock in the morning. The alarm clock was used onto you multiple times which you refused to wake up and kept on slumbering. Don't pull this stunt onto me again, Victor."
He gave a head bob in response only to feel a hand whack the back of his head. 
He grunted as he heard "Apologize, Victor."
Guardian felt the whacking quit as he spoke with a sarcastic voice tone "I apologize for being rude."
He again got the whacking to glare at the guard who spoke "Speak it like you mean it, Victor."
He noticed the Queen smirking spoke his comment in a firm voice tone while eyeing her in the eyes. 
Guardian got nothing more from the guard as the Queen spoke "Is there something you want to admit, Victor?"
He again got the head whack to keep his mouth shut in a thin line only to get from a guard "Talk Victor on why you overslept in bed."
Guardian spoke firmly "I didn't sleep well. I woke up multiple times during my sleep till morning around four o'clock is when I passed out."
He felt himself annoyed with what he said kept his mouth into a thin line to get the Queen displaying a golden eyed look in response followed by her speaking "Don't lie to me, Victor. I can tell lies from the truth. So tell me the truth now."
Guardian heard the firmness of her voice tone spoke in response "I was woken up around four o'clock for an eye exam of my eyes. Didn't the hospital test me on that?"
He glared at the Queen who quit the golden eyed glare and got from her loudly "Transport Nikolai to me now!"
He heard the Compeller's voice tone found a light show to show Nikolai wearing a straitjacket and white too small pants standing in the room with eyes all black looking. 
He exhaled a breath as the Queen spoke "Something you want to admit to me brother, dear?"
Nikolai he eyed gave up a spit sound in response which he found the male forced into a kneeling position by guards and one having a hand onto his long black hair keeping a tight ironclad hold. Guardian found a guard kept him into a sitting position on the couch as he squirmed to look at Nikolai. He kept his mouth into a thin line as the Queen he saw got up and walked around the desk going to Nikolai to stand in front of the male. Guardian frowned as the Queen placed hands onto Nikolai's cheeks and formed her familiar concentration look onto her face while staring at Nikolai who got forced to remain still by guards. He found the Queen forming a pained expression on her face followed by releasing Nikolai to rub hands onto her own cheeks and groaning loudly. Guardian frowned finding the guard restraining him gone to the Queen to put hands onto her shoulders and appeared to be hugging her. He got up to stand finding the Queen giving off wailing noises as he found Nikolai disappearing in a light show as ordered by a guard using Compeller's voice tones. He found himself ignored by the guards standing around the Queen who kept on crying her cries turning hysterical. Guardian felt disgust take hold walked out of the room shutting the double doors only to meet a guard blocking his way. 
He glared at the guard that jabbed a finger towards the office speaking "Inside now!"
Guardian obeyed to walk into the office despite manipulating the doors to find the Queen seated at the desk she having her familiar sneer on her face despite fear in her eyes seen when they fell onto him. He again got thrust to sit onto the couch by the guards and felt a hand onto his shoulder kept him sitting. Guardian didn't comment a response glared at the Queen from his sitting position to find her groaning loudly while rubbing a hand onto her forehead. He heard multiple ahem noises sounding in the room to get the Queen shaking her head and forming her familiar sneer. He glared at the Queen in response while clearing his throat. 
Guardian found the Queen looking in his direction with nervousness seen followed by her speaking "Remind me not to have Nikolai's mind scanned period."
Guardian heard the fearful tone of her voice frowned forming it on his face as he heard typing noises to figure it was the secretary typing onto the laptop. 
He ignored the noises of the laptop typing to hear from the Queen again "So Victor, what do you know of your creation?"
Guardian spoke firmly "Involves medical manipulation of implantation and injections."
He clamped his mouth shut to get the Queen widening her eyes followed by a fear look before appearing to compose her and her speaking "Alright, Victor. I'll admit it. Nikolas keeps on claiming during his crazy moments when I visit him that this Mordecai fathered you too other than him fathering you. I'm not sure if you got this talk from him did you?"
Guardian spoke keeping the firm voice tone "He mentioned this Mordecai in my presence while appearing to be lucid but went crazy again before he could explain."
He kept his mouth shut into a thin line while eyeing the Queen to get her speaking "Alright, I do know of a Mordecai. He's my pouch brother who's locked up in a lunatic asylum with Nikolas at the moment. He's been going around as this Nikolai Crimson claiming to be Charles Crimson's own offspring. Now Charles in question had his light extinguished seen throwing himself out of the window of his residence during a period of drinking himself drunk. No one has been identified as Charles' own offspring in question hence his company going to the Duke of Megiddo to handle and take care of."
He exhaled a breath sensing the Queen lied by her voice tone instead kept his mouth into a thin line while eyeing the female as he heard ahem noises sounding in the room. 
Guardian got from the Queen in response "Alright Parliament is meeting soon. They require the ruler at the time which is you Victor to give out a speech on the status of the kingship title. I have something in mind for you to talk about."
He stiffened from her wording using the word kingship to frown as the Queen proceeded to lecture him on what he was to do while giving a speech to the government. 

Guardian stood in Parliament's government room standing in front of the pulpit giving out his speech worded by the Meritanians blaring in his mind he heard sounded like they were compelled to speak the words to him. He heard the grumpy voice tone of Tut as he gave out the speech to Parliament that sounded like Tut's disagreement with use to voice the speech to him. Guardian felt himself confused hearing the speech's words from Tut sounded like he himself was taking control of Mahalia as their ruler and King and expected to be acknowledged as the heir to the throne. He heard nothing more from Tut to feel the mind scanning quit which he got an applause from the Parliament's members who stood up applauding some seen having looks of relief on their faces he saw. He kept his mouth into a King's mask smile of not baring his teeth as trained by the Queen to do it as he looked around eyeing each Member of Parliament acknowledging him. Guardian felt a compulsion to walk away obeyed while giving a head bob as traditionally done by Kings after a speech and walked to meet the Queen standing near the doorway holding Nicky in her arms. He didn't say a word towards the Queen instead stopped in front of her he noticing she had a pained expression on her face. Guardian heard gasps sounding along with an applause quitting followed by booing sounds. He heard the booing to eye the Queen firmly in the eyes to get her doing a curtsy in response despite her keeping her eyes averted towards Nicky. He found the booing quit to his relief walked away sensing her following. They reached the hallway leading to outside to hear gibberish spoken from the Queen along with Olga coming into sight to yank Nicky from her. Guardian sighed and ignored the Queen finding the guards halting the walk to restrain him in an ironclad hold. He glared at the Queen who kept walking back and forth in front of him in a pace while appearing to be throwing a hissy fit Olga calls them during one of their periods of playing basketball games. He glared at the Queen as he sensed someone was spying onto them ignored the spying to focus onto the female who kept on her pacing back and forth.
This was followed by her snarling "Blast the members of Parliament for booing me! They still are stuck to their sick minds on wanting a King to lead them instead of accepting me!"
He stiffened as he sensed the spying was a recorder recording the scene kept his mouth shut into a thin line only to hear "He's indicating on someone is spying onto us."
Guardian grunted an annoyed sound as the Queen spoke firmly using Compeller's voice tone "Spy come forwards now!"
He heard a meow to find a cat wearing a camera on its collar walking forwards into sight from hiding behind a curtain to get onto the Queen's shoulder and meowing loudly. Guardian eyed the cat warily to find the Queen yanking the gonoid off her shoulder and yanking the camera off its collar despite resistance from the fuzzy. 
He found the Queen tossing a guard the camera followed by her ordering once dropping the cat "Meritanians, you will dump this cat into an eater mountain now!"
He stiffened as the cat disappeared into a light show while hearing snickering like laughter sounding in his mind sounding of the Meritanians. 
Guardian found the Queen speaking "Shut up you stinking plants with you noises and be quiet now!"
He heard nothing more from the Meritanians instead focused onto the Queen to find her adding "Anyway let's get out of here now."
Guardian found he freed from hand holds to follow the Queen out of the building she taking the lead he hearing booing from the presses' people gathered outside. 
He heard loudly "Boo bitch!"
Guardian exhaled a breath hearing the voice sounded of Nikolai's to him but didn't sound like it came from him as he followed the Queen to the limo a long length covered truck. He got inside only to get restrained by the guards to find the Queen giving him a golden eyed glare.
Guardian found he compelled to speak spoke "The voice sounded like that Mordecai you said was locked up calling himself Nikolai Crimson."
He clamped his mouth into a thin line to find the vehicle felt in motion along with freed from the guards' holds. 
He eyed the Queen who formed a faraway look on her face he frowning thinking to himself “What’s was going on with her?” 
Guardian kept eyeing the Queen warily who shut her eyes with a concentration look on her face. 
He frowned to find the Queen opening her eyes with them golden followed by she snarling "Mordecai's out of containment along with Nikolas. Someone betrayed me and set them free. I'll have the betrayer's head chopped off if once I find out who pulled this stunt onto me."
Guardian spoke still using a firm voice tone "You sure that their out of containment? Someone could have just moved them from their jail cells-"
He was interrupted by a hand clamping over his mouth by a guard to focus onto the male who whispered "Her Majesty sees all like an all seeing deity as she is a Goddess."
He saw the familiar expression of reverence in the guard's eyes when they fell onto the Queen who removed his hand and bowed his head while sitting back. Guardian eyed the Queen warily to find her giving him a glare of golden eyes which he kept his mouth into a thin line and refused to budge from staring at her. He found a guard forcing his head down which he kept his eyes onto the Queen who ignored his staring to shut her eyes and appeared to be focusing onto seeing something by her concentration facial expression. Guardian kept his mouth shut as the truck got to the residence followed by getting out with the guards and the Queen he forced to lead the way into the palace. Guardian found Olga inside holding onto Nicky while displaying her familiar all red eyed look which he noticed she was glaring at the Queen. He kept his mouth into a thin line as he was forced to lead the way to the office finding he forced to sit into the couch as the Queen sat in the desk's chair. 
Guardian glared at the Queen with annoyance running through him finding her speaking "Anyhow I know who betrayed me. Meritanians transport one Cruz Miller of Mahalia continent to my office now!"
He found the male appearing into a light show that got forced into a kneeling pose by the guards having an ironclad hold onto the man. 
Guardian found the male Cruz Miller he assumed was him not speaking instead got from the Queen "You think I won't find out that you betrayed me didn't you, Mister Miller?"
He frowned as Cruz was heard "Boo bitch!"
He heard the voice tone sounded of Mordecai to him to find the male slumping over as if dead. Guardian eyed the guards lowering Cruz onto the floor and appeared to be doing heart beater restart work onto the male along with patting him on his face. The guards quit once the Queen went up to them they all kneeling on one knee. 
He got up in response to glare at the Queen noticing his glare and speaking "Meritanians dump this Cruz Miller's body into an eater mountain now!"
Guardian heard her compeller's voice tone found Cruz disappearing into a light show as he felt the guards restrain him and brought him to the Queen's presence. 
He formed a glare aimed at the Queen who spoke "Whose voice did this Cruz Miller spoke in?"
Guardian kept his mouth shut as the guard was heard "He knows whose voice it is from the feel of him."
Guardian got the Queen flaring golden eyes spoke firmly "Cruz sounded like the Guardian of Life and Death you used twin voice tones to this prisoner in a jail cell in the brig I overheard the conversation."
He got from a guard "He knows who the prisoner is."
Guardian spoke firmly "I know him by the name of Herod and no other names."
He again heard from a guard "He knows more than what's he's not saying regarding this Herod."
Guardian glared at the Queen and spoke firmly "Herod is some Compeller that was paired to a staff member a maid named Jacinda who was working for you on the care of Nicky."
He clamped his mouth into a thin line to hear from a guard "And Victor what else aren't you not admitting hmm?"
Guardian kept his mouth shut in a thin line he felt a compulsion to speak obeyed to speak "Herod has admitted to not working for Brittany but in contact with them via middle man. Brittany's ruler according to Herod isn't sure of what to do towards Mahalia. Either retake Mahalia or wreck up your attempts for ruler position Stepmother. Give or take either one the ruler is doing whichever is easy for their King to do."
Guardian again clamped his mouth shut into a thin line to find the guards releasing him to find the Queen going to back to sit down and again getting a pained expression on her face. He again got forced to sit onto the couch to feel pressure of a cat on his lap along with a meow sounding loudly. 
Guardian heard groaning noises sounding in the room followed by hearing "Get that gonoid out of my sight now!"
He got up holding the cat expertly which squirmed in his hand's grips to walk out of the room and got urged to release the gonoid. He obeyed and met a guard that ordered him back into the room. Guardian obeyed to get into the room only to feel pressure onto his foot he looked down to find a mouse gonoid sitting on his shoe grooming itself. 
Guardian groaned as the Queen gave up a loud shriek he finding her standing on the chair and yelling "Get that thing out of my sight now!"
He bent down and with a hand grabbed the mouse by the tail who squeaked an annoyed sound despite the Queen screaming loudly drowning the noises. He took the gonoid out of the room to drop it into a pail held by the butler as if compelled. Guardian got ordered back inside the office which he obeyed to get forced to sit down in the couch. He glared at the Queen finding a guard had her in a hugged hold and was trying to sooth her from her scare. He kept up the glare as the Queen shook off the guard's hold and resumed sitting down in the desk she forming a sneer and saw fear in her eyes. Guardian kept his mouth shut into a thin line as there were multiple ahem noises sounding of the guards' to him. He glared at the Queen as the staff members droned their reports they sounding the same with no change. 
Guardian found the Queen concentrating onto the secretary typing onto the laptop followed by the female snarling "You bitch! You sent the presses an email of our conversations!"
Guardian heard groaning tones in the room to find the secretary ignoring the Queen's outburst instead was continuing on typing into the laptop. He frowned as the Queen had another angry outburst this time focused onto a guard standing next to her. He found the Queen having outbursts of anger onto each staff members’ guards and didn't spare him of the anger. Guardian groaned softly as the Queen got up once she was done with her outburst and went to him slapping a hand onto his cheek.
He glared at the Queen despite grimacing from her hand's slap who snarled "You bastard son of Mordecai! You had to come back from the dead to torment me didn't you?!"
He stiffened from her words as she again slapped him to find Egypt appearing into view speaking "Boo bitch!"
Guardian groaned hearing the voice sounded of Mordecai to him to find the Queen giving Egypt a glare and snarling "You had to insult me didn't you?"
Guardian heard ahem sounds in the room frowned as the Queen looked away to resume looking at him with a glare. 
He felt a compulsion to speak spoke "Baa!"
Guardian clamped his mouth shut feeling himself annoyed with what he said as he glared at the Queen finding himself restrained by the guards. 
He again gave up “Baa!”
Guardian kept “Baa, baa!” loudly till a guard clamped a hand over his mouth cutting him off. 
Guardian glared at the Queen who snarled "Don't tempt me to have you dumped into an eater mountain for insulting me, Victor with that noise your making indicating you as sheep and I as the sheep herder."
Guardian kept the glare in response to feel the guards force him into a standing position to hear "He's not sorry for insulting you Goddess."
He exhaled a breath hearing the voice from a guard holding onto him to realize with a start to why they were holding him which was to feel his moods. 
Guardian inhaled and spoke firmly once his mouth was freed "Why isn't you using your Goddess deity powers to see where your Nikolas and your brother went hmm?"
He glared at the Queen to hear "He's serious on his question Goddess."
Guardian kept the glare only to hear a squeaking sound of a mouse to look down as if compelled to find a mouse sitting on the Queen's shoed foot. He heard a shriek of fear from the Queen followed by the mouse flying in the air as if kicked from her foot only to catch the gonoid with both hands after freed from the guards. Guardian restrained the mouse as the Queen kept on shrieking he finding her going to the desk's chair to stand on it while crying and screaming of terror. Guardian ignored the Queen to walk out of the room to meet the familiar butler having a bucket which he dumped the mouse inside finding himself compelled to go back inside the office. He again got compelled to sit down onto the couch and sat watching the Queen have a crying fit along with a hissing angry fit onto himself and people in the room once she calmed down from her terror. He shifted to glare at the floor ignoring the Queen's hissing fit onto a guard.
 "You bastard didn't do anything to get rid of that gonoid! Keep them out now! Tell Olga if that cat gonoid doesn't catch that gonoid next time it's in the office I'm ordering poison to be done onto the residence! It was Olga's idea to have that fuzzy to catch those terrible things! Ugh!” He heard whined by the Queen.
Guardian ignored the Queen ranting her words and repeating them including saying various gibberish like words to his confusion. He frowned hearing her speaking gibberish that sounded familiar to him but wasn't sure where the language was from. Guardian again got the guards restraining him into a standing position followed by the Queen marching up towards him as he felt his familiar spying sense going off. He found the guards balked on saying anything on his spying sense instead kept silent as the Queen proceeded to use him as punching bag for her fists all over his front and not sparing his sensitive part. He grunted from her fisting a hand clamped over his mouth this time he unable to tell her off on the punching. Guardian kept the glare in response to find the Queen stomping away going back to the desk and sitting down with a loud Humph sound. He heard a squeak sound indicated of a mouse gonoid in the room he heard sounded of death to him. Guardian looked down as if compelled once freed from the guard's grips to find the familiar cat in the room chewing and batting onto a mouse caught between its paws he noticed was still.
Guardian heard ahem noises sounding in the room to hear a shriek from the Queen followed by "Get them both out now!"
He obeyed to pick up the mouse by the tail that remained still and got the cat out of the room following him that appeared to paw his legs in an effort to get the gonoid. 
He ignored the cat to get out into the hallway finding the butler there that spoke "Hand me the mouser now. I'll see that the cat eats it in peace without anyone disgusted by it."
Guardian obeyed to get ordered into the office by another guard “You’re to go to the office now!”
 Guardian mentally spoke in response as he went to sit down on the couch "What's with her obsession of being in the office anyway?"
He felt his mind scanned when he spoke his question to glare at the Queen finding she wasn't scanning him instead had her head down onto the desk with her arms pillowing it. He kept the glare as the guards’ one at a time got him and the staff members out of the office in a quiet move. 
Guardian found the guards in the room entering the room and shutting the doors quietly which he found a guard speaking "I'll lead you to where you're to go."
He didn't say a word in response followed the guard to the King's residence instead of his familiar teenager boy bedroom to find himself led to the ruler's main bedroom and got ordered inside. Guardian walked inside to find the cat sitting on the floor munching onto the mouse he felt disgust take hold to find the guard followed him inside. 
Guardian glared at the guard who spoke "Goddess has ordered bedrooms to be switched this time. You're to take this bedroom while the Goddess takes your old one."
He spoke as the guard made a movement to leave "Would the cat have something to do with the switchover?"
He got from the guard "Sorry I'm not at liberty to say what the Goddess is thinking. What she orders you and whoever here obeys period."
Guardian sighed and found the guard leaving the room which he felt sleepiness went to lie down onto the bed only to hear multiple annoying squeaking sounds next to him. He lifted up the pillow next to him to find a mouse attending to offsprings about five of them he counted and was busy removing them from his presence. Guardian groaned and didn't say a word instead continued to lie down after throwing the pillow onto the floor he hearing an annoyed meow. He ignored the meowing and without a word shut his eyes to pass out unconscious only to come to facing Mordecai speaking his familiar line again making him annoyed. 
Guardian got Egypt appearing into sight flapping her wings over the scale as Mordecai turned around snarling "He's poisoned! He should be dead from the poisoned status!"
He stiffened from Mordecai's words to hear in response a loud meow to find the familiar cat female appearing into view he figured was named High Priestess who was again in a crouch position. 
Guardian eyed High Priestess who spoke "Acknowledge him Mordecai!"
Mordecai he eyed turned around to glare at High Priestess as he felt a pawing onto his face along with a loud meow found the cat female straightening up her form and darting towards him with her hands out. He frowned as High Priestess reached him and hugged him before he felt her bite his neck along with scratching his cheek. He grunted from the pain as High Priestess released him to push him backwards. Guardian found himself lying in bed feeling pain onto his throat and pain onto his cheek as he continued to feel a cat's paw pawing his face. He jerked open his eyes unseeing in the darkness to find the cat appeared in a white blobbed gonoid shape that quit pawing him followed by rubbing its face onto his chin. He heard the begging meows from the cat groaned and forced he to get up blindly seeking the lamp. Guardian found the lamp with effort and turned it on to find the cat on the floor pawing the pillow he tossed while meowing in begging tones. He sighed and went to the pillow to grab lifting it up finding a mouse underneath it appearing to be dead while holding a baby mouse in its mouth. He sighed again and ignored the cat happily chewing onto the baby mouse a pink blob from the looks of it. Guardian went into the bathroom to find it was twin to his teenaged boy bedroom's bathroom. He sighed once his eyes focused onto the mirror via the glaring lights to find a cat bite onto his neck appearing to have broken the skin along with a cat scratch onto his cheek. Groaning Guardian forced himself out of the clothes into the shower stall only to feel a sick feeling hitting him he recognized what it was. He darted out of the shower stall in a hurry and reached the expeller on time. 

Guardian groaned once done with bathroom to come out hand on his stomach injuries from the cat forgotten. He went to the bed and lay down onto his stomach. He shut his eyes only to hear a loud meow sounding in his ear. Guardian jerked open his eyes finding himself restrained to a bed by chains and naked while finding High Priestess showing a feminine body straddling him and purring loudly. He sighed only to find the bed gone along with hitting a floor and High Priestess getting off of him with a loud yowl. Guardian found the chains remained but this time he felt them raise his arms till they were above his head he on tiptoes. He found High Priestess gone from sight as Mordecai walked into view a glare on the male's face who gave him a punch onto the stomach. He found himself spitting blood onto Mordecai from the punch in response. 
Mordecai in response wiped the spit away via gloved hand and spoke "Like father like son still spitting rudely."
Guardian kept the glare spoke firmly "Bitch incarnate as you refer her Queen Svetlana seems to have some mental powers involving with seeing everything like an all seeing deity."
He found Mordecai clamping a hand over his mouth once he was done speaking to get from the male "I already know of that talk. Don't ever mention that bitch to me in my presence. Besides my disciple reports that this bitch in question used some Compeller voice ability onto him to find out what he was. He wound up hearing the Meritanians blurting about his all seeing ability to the bitch that got it transferred to her. She thinks she's so smart having that ability onto her. Well she's got another problem coming to her."
Guardian found his eyes forced shut to come to hearing the alarm blaring its noises which he mumbled "Just let me sleep some more I don't feel good."
He felt a hand shaking his shoulder in an insisting move to groan loudly and rolled over finding the butler there that gave him a golden eyed glare. 
Guardian spoke in a groaning tone "I was sick in the bathroom expelling through my mouth which turned into a marathon session of back and forth ends of expelling. I just got to the bed to lie down and rest once I was sure the expelling sickness quit."
He rolled over only to get the butler shaking his shoulder which he glared to find the male speaking "You were in bed for twenty four hours after Eli indicated that you were sick. You left a terrible mess in the bathroom that I had a servant clean it up. It wasn't a pleasant job of doing that cleaning in question."
Guardian spoke in response "Then why do I feel like I have no energy to get up?"
He got from the butler "Just get up and attend to your hygiene now! You smell from the stink of you being sick!"
He obeyed to get up discovering himself naked while hearing a Tsk sound from the butler. Guardian ignored the butler to go into the bathroom to find it reeked of cleaner to him making his nose wrinkle. 
He got into the shower thinking "Maybe this will wake me up."

Guardian came out of the bathroom wearing his familiar towel around his waist to find his bed stripped of the blankets and looking bare to him. He found the butler thrusting him a pair of sweats which he put on while commando underneath and got thrust a pair of slip on shoes. Guardian sighed feeling the shoes sticking to the bottoms of his feet once he put them on. He ignored the shoes to follow the butler out of the room following the male to the gym room he recalled only had padded walls, floor and punching bag. Guardian frowned finding the gym room had a large X on the floor in the middle. 
He got ordered "Go inside for the Eli to scan you."
Guardian obeyed to stand in the middle of the large X as the lights went out he finding darkness hitting then a red laser light shining over him not sparing his eyes despite he squinted from the glare. He kept on finding the laser's light shining onto his eyes lengthy making him getting annoyed but kept still. Guardian found the laser's light traveled down his body to reach his feet then went up again in a slow manner before turning itself off. He found the lights turning back on followed by the Queen walking into the room a golden eyed glare seen. He kept his mouth shut as he felt the familiar arm holds by the guards this time only two were doing the ironclad holds. 
Guardian glared at the Queen to hear "He's got markings onto him that indicated the cat was playing with him."
He kept the glare as the guard standing next to the Queen spoke “I pointed out his cat scratch on his cheek and bite mark onto his throat.” 
He kept the glare as the butler arrived into the room he noticing the male was appearing to be quietly sneaking into the room before straightening up the form and giving a loud Tsk sound. 
Guardian eyed the butler fully to find the Queen speaking "Anything on what made Victor sick, doctor?"
He kept the glare as the butler spoke "Eli is taking too long to reveal the results, Your Majesty."
He found the Queen glaring at the butler she heard speaking "You will reveal why Eli is taking too long to give up the results."
He grimaced hearing the Compeller's voice tone to find the butler speaking "Hackers got a hold of the Eli just as it scanned Victor and left an insulting message as her response. It's the familiar insult you hate hearing, Your Majesty."
Guardian got the Queen snarling gibberish again only to find a guard hugging her in response she thumping her fists onto the male's chest. He frowned as the guard made no movement to block the Queen's thumping fists. 
He found the Queen quit her thumping to speak "Anything else I should know of, doctor?"
He got from the butler in response "Tests results from the hospital on Victor say a positive match to him as the offspring but the Eli indicated the tests were altered to not fully say the truth. The tests results according to the Eli omitted why Victor hasn't inherited the liquid diet or his Father's looks or the looks of his Mother. 
I was trying to find out why the Eli was saying ‘Sabotage done onto the tests.’ 
The hackers made their presence known with their familiar insulting message aimed at you in question."
Guardian eyed the Queen who again got into a hissing angry fit she continued on speaking her familiar gibberish words. He found a guard calming her followed by a loud squeak sound to look down finding a mouse on the floor looking like it was sick. 
He heard a shriek from the Queen along with her familiar comment "Get that thing out of here!"
Guardian found himself freed from the guards as they went to the Queen to try to sooth her screaming in terror. He found the butler in response displaying golden eyes to go to the mouse that stopped jerking and picked the gonoid by the tail and carried it arm length in front of him out of the room. He followed only to find a guard blocking his way and jabbing a finger towards the Queen a golden eyed glare seen from the male. He ignored the guard and went to stand near the Queen who quit her screaming followed by feeling the guards restraining him again. He glared at the Queen who proceeded to use him as a punching bag he grunted through his throat from the pain. Guardian found his mouth covered up again as he glared at the Queen who kept on the punching while speaking her familiar gibberish. He kept the glare to realize with a start the gibberish was a phrase spoken over and over by how it sounded to him. 
Guardian kept his mouth shut as he glared at the Queen who quit her angry behavior followed by her snarling "Get him out of my sight now!"
He found himself freed to hear from the Queen speaking "Meritanians transport Guardian to an eater mountain and dump him in it now!"
He stiffened from the Compeller's voice tone to find himself floating in air to sense light down below he saw was a mountain having a fiery top with eaters to fall towards it. He felt sleepiness shut his eyes only to come to facing Mordecai speaking his familiar line again. 
Guardian kept the glare as Egypt appeared manipulating the scale again as Mordecai spoke "Argh! Egypt quit it that manipulation now! He's good as dead from the volcano! It's known to eat humanoids dumped into it!"
He heard a loud Awk sound sounding loudly to find something like claws digging into his left shoulder he looked to find a bird sitting there. Guardian recognized the bird with the brown body and all white head as Eagle, deity of birds' symbol of life. 
He didn't say a word as he glared at Mordecai who spoke "Blast you Eagle for getting involved with this conflict! Don't tell me that Egypt has been warming your bed-"
"I have not!" He heard from Egypt shrieking loudly interrupting Mordecai to get the male glaring at her.
Guardian glared at Mordecai to find the male speaking "Ryder Hawks. I should have known that they were around watching for the Meritanians to dump anything into that volcano which they'll catch and fly it elsewhere. No wonder Eagle's pet is sitting onto Victor's shoulder. Get your miserable excuse of a son out of my sight now!"
Guardian found Egypt pushing him backwards which he came to feeling himself lying onto something warm and soft which he rolled over only to hear a loud screech. He jerked open his eyes to find the warm and soft thing was a Ryder Hawk in a nest with him while feeling paws of a cat walking onto his legs. Guardian eyed the cat that got onto his front purring away giving off vibrations and curling into a ball. He groaned hearing nothing from the Ryder Hawk but a soft growling noise from the gonoid. 
Guardian sighed and shut his eyes figuring to he "I might as well get some rest."

Guardian came to feeling he floating in the air while feeling his top were tight on his form. He looked around to find a Ryder Hawk was carrying him he looked down to discover the ocean. He grunted as he felt vertigo forced himself to look straight ahead to spot something shiny in view. Guardian frowned seeing the shininess as it got closer and closer to recognize it as a building on a seaport with multiple boats sailing towards it. He eyed the seaport with disgust within him to recognize it as a seaport in Victoria State. He groaned as the Ryder Hawk dropped him to land onto padded floor to his confusion along with familiar hand holds forcing him to stand up. He found himself in the King's gym room facing the Queen who had a golden eyed glare. 
He glared at the Queen in response to find her quit the golden eyed glare and got her speaking "Ryder Hawks?"
Guardian kept his mouth shut only to feel a hand whacking the back of his head he spoke "Yes they saved my life but I fell asleep before I fell into that eater mountain so don't ask me on that. I woke up in a nest with one and fell asleep again only to wake up toted around the sea."
He glared at the Queen in response to get her speaking while forming a sugary facial expression "Sweetie tells me what happened to you after you were transported out by mistake?"
Guardian heard the familiar sugary sweet voice tone of the Queen as he kept his mouth shut into a thin line and kept the glare aimed at the female. He found the Queen repeated her words with the expression on her face changing into anger despite her eyes having fear in them. He kept the glare in response as the Queen exploded her familiar phrase gibberish loudly in an angry voice tone as he felt a coldness arrive to him. Guardian found the guards ignoring the stiffening he made to the coldness as the Queen kept on ranting her familiar wording over and over followed by her pacing and thrusting fists onto her sides. 
He kept his mouth into a thin line as the Queen stared at him with fear seen on her face she gasping out "Mordecai?"
Guardian felt himself compelled to speak spoke "Boo bitch!"
He felt sleepiness hitting him slumped over in the guards' hands' grips while feeling the coldness left him to groan loudly before speaking in a slurred voice tone "Did anyone catch that dump truck?"
Guardian felt a hand patting him on the cheek as he continued to speak his familiar question in a slurred voice tone till he jerked open his eyes to find the Queen was the hand's owner. 
He formed a glare aimed at the Queen while speaking "Possessing me is a sick way to go Stepmother. Stay out of my body-"
He got a hand clamped over his mouth cutting him off as he glared at the Queen. 
He heard "He does know what happened to him."
Guardian got the Queen giving off her familiar rant along with punching him all over he kept the glare aimed at her as she quit the punching. 
"Mordecai" she gasped out he heard "Is my enemy an evil spirit causing me trouble including the one responsible for this insulting comment of 'Boo bitch.'"
Guardian sensed she lied gave up a growling noise in his throat only to feel his air cut off by a hand grabbing his air pipe on his throat. He glared at the Queen as his air pipe was released followed by his mouth. 
He kept the glare in response as the Queen spoke "See Victor to his bedroom now!"
Guardian found the guards' hand holds off him followed by finding himself transported to the King's bedroom he forced himself to lie down onto the bed growling angrily. He heard multiple annoyed squeak sounds grunted in response only to feel a rattling noise sounding familiar along with a bite felt onto his neck which he felt himself passing out unconscious to face Mordecai again. Guardian felt annoyance take hold hearing Mordecai going into his familiar line. 
He interrupted "Spare me of your line now!"
He glared at Mordecai who spoke in response "You were bit by a rattler with poison enough to kill a humanoid by the bite onto your neck. What do you have to say about this, Egypt?"
Guardian folded his arms with a glare aimed at Mordecai who was looking at Egypt he saw above the scale. 
He kept the glare as Egypt shrieked "Did you say something about promising a certain Egyptian that you would do anything to keep a male child alive to the annoying one?"
Guardian got Mordecai giving off the Queen's familiar gibberish and twin tantrum like behavior by the male pacing in front of him throwing his fists back and forth. He heard a meow sounding loudly to find High Priestess coming into view to examine his neck he grimaced was where the bite was. 
He glared at Mordecai as High Priestess was heard speaking "Annoying one or not she's my Goddess and my leader but this time she's too busy amusing herself with living like an Egyptian as you called them Egypt."
Guardian eyed High Priestess to find the female scratching his neck with her clawed hand right over the bite he grimacing from the pain and hearing her add "Nighty night."
He felt his eyes forced shut to pass out unconscious to come to hearing voices speaking in excited tones. He grunted from the voices sounding loudly along with hearing a female voice sounding commanding compelling him to focus onto her. Guardian kept onto focusing onto the female voice as if compelled till he came to finding himself lying in bed hearing beeping noises of a monitor along with pain in his neck. He grunted shaking the sleepiness from his head trying to clear his mind as he saw a whip flash in his mind. 
He frowned as the whip continued to flash in his mind followed by a terrible headache hitting him making him grunt from the pain as he heard "Bloody Hades! He's moving! Keep him still!"
Guardian grunted from the pain but remained still as he felt something picking onto his eyes he found himself unable to see through them but darkness. He continued to feel the picking onto his eyes till light blared into them making them water. 
Guardian grunted from the light's blaring to move his head away to hear "His eyes are fine from the way he's reacting to my flashlight."
Guardian kept moving his head away from the light's glare that followed only to hear "Meritanians just put Victor down asleep. He needs his rest anyway."
He felt sleepiness hitting him passed out unconscious.

Guardian came to hearing a loud meow sounding in his ear he rolled over while in bed from the noise. He felt a cat's paws walking onto his side along with a loud ear splitting meow sounding in his ear. Guardian jerked his eyes open lurching into a sitting position to find the cat was gone and not in sight. He found himself back into the King's bedroom this time the pillows and blankets were appearing to be replaced as he heard nothing to indicate of mouse gonoids from his moving the bed. Guardian eyed the clock time finding it blared eight o'clock in the morning. He grunted and got up from the bed he feeling himself clad only in shorts on his form as the heater in the room sounded loudly. Guardian sensed himself stared at to find the butler in the room giving off his familiar Tsk sound. 
He glared while speaking "I need to attend to my hygiene-"
Guardian was interrupted "Not till you pass a simple test by my scanner."
He didn't comment a response cooperated as the butler scanned him via scanner which he spoke "I thought the Eli was hacked?"
He glared at the butler to hear ahem sound to find the Queen in the room with eyes red from crying. 
He exhaled a breath as she spoke in response "The Eli has been locked out at the moment by hackers. We're still trying to get access. A personal computer such as the scanner the doctor is using hasn't been hacked yet. It appears the hackers aren't interested despite heavy protection done onto the personal equipment."
Guardian heard the edge in the Queen's voice tone that indicated that she wasn't fully telling him the truth. 
He spoke firmly "What happened to me anyway?"
Guardian heard "I'll tell him, Your Majesty."
He heard from the butler who added "The cat wasn't doing a good job in catching mousers. Instead was more interested in playing with them than catching them to extinguish their lights. A rattler gonoid was brought into the residence to take care of the problem. Unfortunately the rattler targeted you instead of targeting the mousers."
Guardian heard nothing more from the butler spoke "And what else happened that you're not admitting, Stepmother? Your voice tone when you spoke of the Eli was indicating it."
He glared at the Queen who collapsed onto her knees wailing back and forth as he found the butler grabbing his arm and with force of strong strength got him into the bathroom slamming the door. 
Guardian blinked from the glare of the lights turning on to glare at the butler who spoke "Test results from the hospital say that you have DNA from two males appearing to be your Father which one was pointed out to be the father medically."
He kept the glare while folding his arms as the butler continued ignoring his glaring stare "DNA says you're both the offspring of His Majesty Nikolas and this Mordecai the Queen claims him as her brother. But you're more Mordecai's son by the tests indicating it in percentages hence you not inherited His Majesty's liquid diet habit."
Guardian didn't say a word in response as the butler added "Strip and get into the shower now. I'll see that Her Majesty has calmed down enough to answer some questions you seemed to want answered."
He found the butler fading from view to hear the door slam which he stripped himself of the shorts and entered the shower stall. Guardian forced himself to clean as thoroughly as he could then get out drying himself with a towel. He walked out of the bathroom to find the Queen seated on the armchair fawned over by four guards. He found the Queen did a double take look seeing him and his bare chest got her groaning in response followed by shutting her eyes. Guardian heard an ahem sound to find the butler handing him a suit of clothes which he put on ignoring the Queen sensed staring at him. He found his clothes were twin to his coronation clothes to hear ahem sounds from the guards and the familiar Tsk sound from the butler. Guardian stood with arms folded facing the Queen he finding her and himself alone in the room. 
He kept the glare as he spoke "Was that you that compelled me to live? I heard a female voice using a Compeller's tone that called me away from the Guardian of Life and Death enough to focus onto to live for life's sakes."
He clamped his mouth into a thin line to find the Queen rocking the rocking chair in response while staring away from him. Guardian frowned as the Queen didn't answer him instead gave up her familiar phrase in some singing voice tone he recognized she was speaking in a little girl's voice tone. 
He felt annoyance take hold walked away thinking to himself "She's crazy."
Guardian found he able to walk out of the room unstopped only to meet the guards outside that went into the room slamming the door. He felt a compulsion to walk obeyed finding himself led to the brig despite guards letting him through to hear the familiar phrase spoken in a male's voice tone. Guardian exhaled a breath and went to the jail cell where Herod was leaning against the wall that was singing in some firm male voice tone. He glared at Herod finding the male was wearing a jumpsuit of orange and had feet bare along with black hair a long length down his shoulders. 
He clapped his hands getting Herod to quit his singing followed by the male speaking "Interesting that the bitch incarnate would let you see me."
Guardian heard Herod's voice tone sounded of Mordecai to him as he gave the male a glare and spoke "She compelled me to live surviving from the bite of a rattler gonoid."
Guardian got from Herod doing a double take look before speaking "That phrase she and her disciples chant belongs to Lance Richard. 
It means 'Death cannot touch us, we will live forever.'
She got it from Lance Richard who fell for her feminine charms enough to pleasure him in bed. He got pleasured enough to believe all sort of talk she said regarding one disciple servant dubbed Nikolai that was manipulated by Compellers to be a drunkard. Nikolai in question happened to be her pouch brother actually."
Guardian frowned as Herod gave up a chuckle sound then added "A man can be led by his thing if you know what I mean even male deities aren't immune to it either. A female can be led by their ogling male who look pleasant to the eye and is a charmer. Males and females aren't immune to this ogling bit by either one. It's something the Queen used when she saw you without coverage onto your front looking twin to her husband's even with that scarring on your arm."
He got another chuckle as he spoke "She freaked out and saved my life in the process didn't she?"
Guardian got from Herod singing his familiar phrase and found the male ignoring him staring which he sighed and felt a compulsion to walk away. He obeyed to get compelled to go to the King's bedroom to find the door shut. He knocked onto the door and waited impatiently as a guard opened it with golden eyes that made him glare back. Guardian glared in response as the guard stepped aside and allowed him entry to find the Queen still in the rocking chair he hearing her singing her familiar gibberish line over and over. He sighed and kneeled in front of the Queen and reached for her hand getting her gasping loudly once his hand gripped her hand. He found his familiar cauldron scene seen in his mind as he eyed the Queen who looked at him before bursting into tears and looking away singing her line. Guardian frowned as the Queen kept on singing while crying tears he finding her eyes was indicating of implants to him by how the watery tears fell. Guardian kept his mouth into a thin line while holding onto the Queen's hand her allowing him to hold as she kept on crying halting her rocking. He didn't say a word in response as the Queen kept on crying seemingly lengthy till he felt fed up with holding her hand released it getting no protest from her. Guardian got up without a word and left the room unstopped to feel a compulsion to go into a direction. Guardian obeyed to go to a spare bedroom he hearing scratching sounds of a cat on the door. He opened the door to get a cat landing onto his shoulder in a loud meow tone and rubbing its head onto the side of his head. He sighed and recalled High Priestess's comment carried the cat to the King's bedroom to again knock onto the door. Guardian found the cat squirming while held to find a guard opening the door which he thrust the cat without a word. He found the guard taking the cat and slamming the door in response which he felt compelled to stand in the hallway he feeling annoyance take hold. Guardian folded his arms standing seemingly lengthy till the door opened and a guard came out thrusting him the cat and got a head shake from the male. He sighed and took the cat putting it onto his shoulder who gave up a meow he heard sounded angry to him. Guardian heard nothing from the guard but the door slamming in response to feel the cat's paws digging into his shoulder. He sighed and found the cat curling around the back of his neck which he ignored and walked away going to Olga's bedroom to knock onto the door. 
He heard a faint "Come in."
Guardian came into the room after manipulating the door finding Olga inside sitting in the rocking chair rocking away while holding onto Nicky as the cat was felt jumping off of him. 
He sighed and went to Olga to kneel in front of her he spoke "What's going on with your Mother? It's like she's very upset and is letting it control her."
Guardian got a sound of disgust from Olga in response followed by her speaking "It's just her remembering that she killed her nephew my cousin in question. The official story involves her finding out she could compel people to do things. She as the official story goes got her nephew to rob a jewelry store to get jewelry for her. He wound up shot to death by a guard guarding the jewelry store. Her brother, my uncle Mordecai as said by her took the death hard and got himself drunk too many times enough to drown himself by jumping off a bridge into the water down below."
Guardian spoke "What's the unofficial story?"
Olga spoke "She admits to be very long lived long enough to have lived during Brittany's time of discovering Mahalia."
Guardian frowned but didn't say a word in response as Olga continued "She admits that she got herself to the point of being declared a Queen of a kingdom named Abydos is when her brother challenged her to the throne. He according to her was born first and a pouch brother something he used authority over her for control means. Anyway she admits that she did a terrible thing back then which was the execution of her brother's son. The memory of his execution of having his head chopped off has always stayed in her mind. Has refused to leave her despite no matter how many times she tried to will away the memory. Hence she currently was taking anything to get that memory away from her mind."
Guardian spoke as she paused "Hence she saving my life in hopes it would free her from the torment."
He clamped his mouth shut seeing Olga's eyes turn all red to hear Nicky giving off a loud wailing noise. 
Guardian got from Olga in response "Get out! I just got Nicky to sleep!"
He obeyed to shut the door quietly hearing Nicky's crying quit. Guardian felt a compulsion hitting him obeyed to find he led to Herod's jail cell the male still singing away his familiar line while sitting. Guardian sighed as Herod saw him and appeared to be singing happily with a smile while making him annoyed. He clapped his hands in response to get Herod giving off a double take look. 
Guardian spoke "Her daughter claims that she has memory of her nephew's execution fully in her mind and can't get rid of the memory. Hence she desperate to do anything including saving my life in hopes of getting rid of it."
He glared at Herod who gave up a chuckle sound followed by the male speaking "You don't know anything of pouch siblings having an annoying bothersome connection don't you, hmm?"
He spoke firmly "You sound like her connection to her pouch brother is bothering her."
Guardian got from Herod in response "Actually Mordecai used his pouch connection to cause her pain. It involves what he drinks you call by this word of beer. It's some kind of poison that numbs the connection so she can't feel him and he can't feel her."
He exhaled a breath as Herod continued "The lack of the connection kind of rattles her enough to feel fearful of whenever he'll strike onto her without a warning. Hence the joke of boo and bitch used together onto her from time to time. She got that saying from Lance Richard actually who discovered what she did to him. As in using her feminine wills onto him to get his Deity Lord status in Brittany go to her she seen as a Goddess. Hence his vessel has refused to travel out of Columbia at the moment."
Guardian inhaled a breath as Herod added before he could talk "Lance Richard actually posing as his own vessel is still smarting from the joke stunt this Helena pulled onto him. Hence he was sickening her brother to be his vessel and travel all over Egyptia as the vessel of him. He doesn't want to wound up as a victim again like what Helena did to him. Poor Nikolai didn't have a choice in the matter of being his vessel. Instead was thrown into it. Nikolai has been trying to break off the vessel status by the creation of the Lancelot group in Megiddo and the Samira group in Mahalia."
Guardian got Herod singing his familiar line again which he figured was speak for "Talks over go away."
He obeyed without commenting a word and went to the King's bedroom to find the guards standing outside one blocked his way of trying to knock onto the door.
Guardian formed a glare and glared at the guard who spoke "Goddess's sleeping now. We managed to get her to lie down into bed and sleep using Compeller voice orders. Don't disturb her."
He kept his mouth shut into a thin line and without a word walked away finding himself compelled. He followed the compulsion to find himself led to the familiar teenaged boy's bedroom. He grunted an annoyed sound to go inside finding Herod sitting in the armchair to his shock. 
He shut the door as if compelled to find Herod speaking "The Meritanians transported me to here while giving me images in my mind on what I'm supposed to be saying towards you in question."
Guardian kept his mouth shut into a thin line to find Herod speaking "Her influence as Goddess in Brittany got too much to the point that the people started to spite her enough to not want anything to do with her. Hence this Yevgeny Visser leaving Brittany to go to Mahalia and kicking out Brittany's ruler ship out. His reason for the kick outs was to keep her Goddess influence out of Mahalia. He didn't agree with her Goddess's influence in question and wanted it out of Mahalia. The Brittany natives living in Mahalia recognized what he was doing helped out and declared him King as their ruler. The Kingship title was a promise to keep her out. He didn't keep his promise actually."
Guardian didn't say a word as Herod added "Brittany's natives got to the point when they stopped in believing her as their Goddess and started believing into something else. Some of them renewed interests into Lance Richard including some other gods and goddesses some I'm not sure of their names. Anyway she found no one believed into her anymore and found her brother's connection gone from her. He managed to find out some poison to kill the connection in question but left sloppy signs of the poison status originated from Mahalia. Hence she here in Mahalia trying to get her brother to stop this poisoned status and trying to get that connection restarted up again. It's something she's forgotten to do. Instead she's restarted this Goddess deity business again despite horrible resistance from the restless natives who seem to know of it."
Guardian spoke "Then what's with the saying of boo and bitch together anyway aimed at her?"
Herod spoke "I was telling the truth on what I said regarding that saying. Lance Richard originated it. Her brother took it up and has been saying that wording to torment her. Her brother in question is still drinking that poison so he won't feel the connection. The poison left a side effect onto him leaving him incapable of fathering offsprings via mating use onto females. Hence he had to use implantation methods for that to happen. It resulted into his son Robert born of a hotel maid paid a heavy currency price to carry him."
Guardian frowned as Herod cleared his throat then continued "Unfortunately Robert got adopted by a couple who found the maid pregnant and paid her a fool's price to give them the baby. The fool's price involved her married to me brother of that couple and carrying my own offsprings in question. The reason why it's a fool's price is because neither one of us were in love with each other actually. My brother turned my parents against me by pretending to be the good older son. He got me to be married to that maid just to claim responsibly for her carrying status so he could take her baby in question and raised it in his influence."
He exhaled a breath as Herod continued after a chuckle "Too bad the influence turned out to backfire onto him. Robert hated everything my brother tried to influence him in. It involved trying to be in the public eye running for Senator's position something Robert balked on doing. Instead Robert joined the Navy with faked parental permission and got onto a Mahalian warship bound to Megiddo is where he met Nikolai his actual father. His parentage came out as a result of him causing too much scandalized behavior on Megiddo's islands with some female he was in love with. The presses had a field day announcing him the son of Nikolai Crimson as the bitch incarnate brother is calling himself now."
He found Herod paused to sing his familiar line and found the male disappearing in a light show to frown hearing a door knocking sound on the door. Guardian sighed and went to the door yanking it open wide to find Olga there giving him her familiar red eyed glare. 
Guardian spoke firmly "Out with it now, Olga!"
He glared at Olga who spoke "You're supposed to open the door a crack to see who's out knocking onto your door then open it wider to let the visitor in. It's protocol around here as ordered by our Father in question. Too many servants paid by the presses have been leaking unflattering photos and recordings of our Father over the cycles. It's why the public is now wanting him out of the King's title and having you take his place."
He hissed a breath as Olga quit the red eyed glare in response he noticing her not having Nicky on hand.
He spoke "Where's Nicky in question?"
Olga replied "With the cook who's sort of a babysitter with Nicky whenever I need time alone from him. My Mother gave up caring for him and left me do the job mainly despite using him as a prop while out in public."
He inhaled and spoke "Something you wanted since your here seeing me?"
He frowned as Olga spoke displaying her red eyed look again "Just prove to me that you can defend yourself from someone trying to knock you out when answering the door with me as the attacker."
He found Olga throwing fists aimed at his head obeyed to do karate taught self defense moves to get his sister into an arm lock hold around her neck with hand holding onto her hair from the back. Guardian found Olga's efforts to free herself from the arm lock hold met failure. 
He spoke as she gave up a loud Humph "Don't you have training for this?"
Olga spoke in response "I do have training but what you got me trapped in is twin to the move Daddy would pull onto me to discipline me."
He freed Olga only to get her kicking at his sensitive part he blocked followed by her giving off another Humph and walking out of the room slamming the door with a bang sound. Guardian grimaced from the door's banging to hear a familiar knocking sound onto the door. He sighed and recalled what Olga told him involving the door to open a crack to peer finding her standing there. He opened the door wide and got attacked by Olga again this time she swinging a ball's bat aimed at him. Guardian proceeded to use karate training to get the ball's bat out of her hand's grips and into pieces followed by again getting her into Nikolas's familiar lock hold. 
Guardian ignored Olga's whining “I’m begging to be freed using our father as reason why you should do it.” 
He felt himself annoyed willed he to calm despite annoyed with Olga's pleading to ignore it. Guardian ignored her begging and pleading to the point that he got her kneeling onto the floor and kept he calm. He sensed himself spied on found the Queen standing in the doorway arms folded a glare on her face. 
Guardian freed Olga to glare at the Queen he noticing his sister noticed her mother to speak "Alright just testing him on his self defensive abilities. He's highly trained like Daddy is."
He kept the glare aimed at the Queen who spoke "Olga go to Nicky and leave now!"
He heard the angry voice tone of the Queen found Olga obeying followed by his sister slamming the door. 
Guardian kept the glare aimed at the Queen who spoke again "What did Herod say to you? He was found not in his jail cell for a certain time period causing a panic. Guards went to search for him found him singing in another jail cell. Herod has balked explaining why he was in that jail cell or how he got there. Besides guards say that you were the last visitor to visit Herod before the panic of him not being in his jail cell got started up. So talk now."
Guardian found his arms grabbed by the familiar guards he figured were the Queen's Goddess disciples he glared at her without saying a word. 
He found the Queen repeating her question followed by hearing "He knows what Herod said to him and get it's your question."
He kept his mouth into a thin line hearing the guard's familiar voice to continue to glare at the Queen as he felt a coldness feeling arrive within him. Guardian found the Queen gasping while looking down at the floor as the guards released him to kneel in front of her. He felt the coldness take control to glare at the Queen finding her looking up staring at him with pleading. 
Guardian spoke as if compelled “Boo bitch!” getting the Queen gasping "Mordecai got him again!"
He gave up hysterical laughter in a creepy voice tone to find the guards refused to go near him by fading from view leaving him alone her despite her ordering the disciples to grab him. Guardian waved a hand mentally ordering paralysis to hit the Queen's feet. He walked up towards her while cackling in his creepy voice tone seeing the Queen had panic onto her face. 
Guardian quit the laughter to speak "Helena, how desperate is you this time hmm?"
He got a gasp from the Queen who appeared to shake of fear with the pleading on her face and fear in her eyes. 
He heard his voice sounded creepy continued speaking "Herod admitted to Victor that you're desperate for restoring that pouch connection with your brother my disciple Nikolai."
He got a gasp from the Queen who shut her eyes as he kept on speaking "Too bad Helena. It was I who told Nikolai to break that pouch connection."
Guardian got the Queen opening her eyes with shock in them as he gave up a head bob and continued speaking "I knew that your pouch connection was vital to you and your life as a Goddess deity. No wonder your here in Mahalia trying to get it back. You knew that I sent him here to break it. Don't deny it, Helena that the pouch connection is what you want the most hence your Goddess deity tricks done onto the restless natives of Mahalia. It's just you trying to find out that connection in question."
He formed a glare aimed at the Queen who opened her mouth to speak only to feel the coldness feeling leaving him giving him a headache. He groaned loudly while rubbing a hand onto his forehead he feeling his mind scanned by the Meritanians. Guardian didn't say a word as he found the guards back into the room restraining him and he forming a glare aimed at the Queen. The Queen he saw appeared to compose herself followed by collapsing onto her knees with a loud gasp. 
He glared at the Queen as she spoke "My feet! I can't feel my feet!"
Guardian rolled his eyes in response and found the guards freeing him to go to the Queen picking her up. 
He glared at the Queen who snarled "That Mordecai did this stunt onto my feet. Just carry me to my bedroom now. I'll deal with his disciple Victor as he calls himself later."
Guardian heard ahem noises from the guards ignored the noises to find the males carrying the Queen out of the room which he followed to slam the door behind them. 
He spoke out loud "Good riddance."
"Not so Victor." He heard blared in his mind from Tut.
Guardian instead of answering flopped onto the bed onto his back and stared at the ceiling as he felt Tut still scanning him to mentally spoke in response "Do you mind? I'm trying to think of what snappy come back to say to Stepmother accusing me of serving this Mordecai as his disciple. Good riddance."
He heard a chuckle sound from Tut followed by hearing "Actually just go to sleep you need it."
Guardian frowned hearing Tut's words to feel sleepiness shut his eyes to find himself facing Mordecai looking angry and growling the familiar line he heard from Herod. He glared at Mordecai to find Egypt floating nearby her having arms folded and a glare on her face aimed at the male. 
Guardian spoke in response "What pouch connection is people babbling about that this bitch incarnate is obsessed with getting?"
He got Mordecai punching him in the stomach in a fast speed blurry move. 
He grunted from the fisting to glare at Mordecai who spoke "Only I can call her bitch incarnate. I don't want to hear you saying it to me again."
Guardian spoke "Fine Helena-"
He was interrupted with a fist into his jaw cutting him off making him groan as Mordecai spoke again "Don't mention the bitch incarnate name to me again. Egypt, get your son out of my sight now."
Guardian glared at Mordecai in response to find the male resumed standing on top of the stairs with his familiar scale and giving Egypt a glare and jabbing a finger aimed at him. 
He got Egypt shrieking in response "You fathered him so you get him out!"
Guardian groaned softly as Mordecai spoke "Again with that fathering joke Egypt. It's getting tiring of hearing it from you."
Guardian spoke in response "why am I here?'
He got Egypt and Mordecai looking at him to get the male speaking "You want me to extinguish his light for that question, Egypt?"
Guardian got Egypt shaking her head in an Egyptian no style gesture and fading from view only to find her appear in front of him pushing him backwards. He came to feeling a cat sitting on his front meowing loudly. Guardian groaned softly and forced his eyes open to glare at the cat that gave up hissing sounds as he found the Queen in the room via light show. 
He heard the cat kept up the hissing as the Queen spoke "Meritanians transport this cat out of the room to another location somewhere in the residence. Forget the eater mountain. Just get the thing out of my presence now."
Guardian found the cat disappearing in a light show to glare at the Queen who fell to kneel she groaning out "Restore my feet, Mordecai."
He sensed them spied on from her groaning tone she having an angry expression despite trying to keep her face’s away from the doorway's vicinity. 
He kept the glare as the Queen continued her begging with tone sounded familiar to him “Restore my feet, Mordecai.” 
Guardian lay down on the bed ignoring the Queen using females' familiar tone indicating of not going to listen to anything till their order or request was going to be done. He recognized the tone from pregnant females giving out demands while in the bouts of labor pains and giving off lots of requests. Guardian ignored the Queen using the familiar voice tone to get up feeling fed up with her speaking to walk by her only to find her grabbing his legs. He peeled off her hands' in a fast move and darted out of the bedroom slamming the door only to feel sickness hitting him. Guardian found his familiar guards holding onto his arms hauling him into the bedroom to the Queen kneeling on the floor. He glared at the Queen while forced into a kneeling position to find her holding up a syringe and smirking. He struggled against the guards' ironclad holds as she injected the syringe into his neck and pumped the contents into him. He found the familiar sickness involving rattler's poison hitting him from the feel and felt himself passing out unconscious.

Guardian came to finding he facing Mordecai who gave up a sound of disgust to find Egypt floating nearby. 
He got Mordecai speaking "Do something regarding your son, Egypt. I'm getting tired of these useless visits to see me judging him when you'll do anything to keep him alive."
Guardian gave Mordecai a glare in response to speak "Father."
He got punched into the stomach by Mordecai using super speed move followed by the male speaking "Don't call me, Father-"
"He's your son!" He heard shrieked from Egypt.
Guardian again spoke "Father-'
Only to get interrupted by Mordecai gagging him on the throat as Egypt shrieked again "It's true he's your son!"
Guardian gagged out "Isn't it true that sons bare the face of their Fathers?"
He got himself freed from the choke hold to find Mordecai seated onto a white throne chair looking like the male was rock hard like stone. Guardian groaned getting the familiar image of Mordecai not acknowledging the question and recognized that his persona Nikolai was having a crying fit again. He walked up the stairs towards Mordecai to put hands onto the throne chair's armrests while leaning forwards toward the male. 
He spoke again "Why are you in denial about this? Accept it that I'm your son. I bare your face, Father. It's like any male Egyptian does towards the one who fathered him. The face baring is a reminder of where the son came from fathered by this male who spawns him to existence-"
Guardian got a roar from Mordecai followed by the male getting up from the chair pushing him backwards he falling backwards seemingly lengthy only to feel something like a bed hitting his back along with a feminine voice compelling him to extinguish his light. Guardian found himself still clinging to his body and refusing to die as the voice compelled him to do. He heard a shrieking sound of Egypt's voice to hear the female Compeller's voice cut off followed by groaning sounds. Guardian found himself back into his body while restrained in a straitjacket from the feel as he was lying onto something padded. He jerked open his eyes to find the Queen nearby groaning while seated in a wheelchair. 
Guardian sat up glaring at the Queen who quit the groaning followed by her speaking "Meritanians transport me and my guards out now!"
He found the Queen's order obeyed to get up from the floor feeling padded all over the place to lean against the wall. He recalled himself able to get out of a straitjacket did the maneuver and got he freed of the thing only to hear a faint alarm sound. Guardian got his arms freed only to find the door to the room opening showing the familiar two vampires coming into the room growling loudly as they took off their head gear. 
He felt the familiar coldness feeling hitting him spoke "You can't contain me for I'll always get out."
Guardian got the vampires giving roars in response followed by them throwing their head gear aimed at him which he caught with each hand. Guardian got the vampires charging towards him body attacks which he proceeded to use karate onto them knocking them onto the floor and dropped the head gear. He stripped himself of the jacket and walked to the door only to feel sleepiness hitting him. He grunted as the sleepiness persist finding the door was only a piece of glass along with hearing a faint sound of gas going off. Guardian collapsed onto the floor shutting his eyes passing out unconscious to dream of himself as someone facing his father Nikolai. 
Nikolai held up the cup of beer he saw was brown liquid and spoke "Here drink."
He saw the hand come into view looking smaller and not adult sized to take the cup and sipped it before spitting it out while speaking "What the depths is this?!"
Guardian saw through eyesight Nikolai holding up a plant by a pot he didn't recognize and got from the male "It's the source of my drink actually. This plant I dub Helena's poison actual name of Brittany's Yuck for tasting bad can only be found in Mahalia. I managed to recreate samples of the plant to grow in Megiddo in my residence farm. Too bad the farm isn't doing anything to give me what I want actually. I'm forced to go to Mahalia to replenish my supplies for drinking cultivation at my farm there."
He heard a meow sounding loudly followed by feeling himself back into the straitjacket and leaning against the padded wall. He grunted an annoyed sound as he shook sleep from him to look around finding the two vampires were lying in the room asleep from the looks of them. Guardian found one vampire looking at him with white orbed eyes through the black mask and baring his teeth aimed at him. He sighed and adjusted his position to lean back onto the padded wall refraining from freeing himself to the restraint. He eyed the ceiling as if needing to do it to find a window high above him appearing to look black to him and sensed someone was spying onto him. He glared at the person spying onto him he sensed was the Queen from rage hitting him. Guardian kept the glare as the window opened sliding with a fast move to get the Queen coming into sight by wheelchair. 
He kept the glare as the Queen spoke "So talk on why I should free you from this lunacy?"
Guardian found he compelled to speak spoke "It's a drink he makes to kill off that pouch connection."
He felt himself annoyed with what he spoke glared at the Queen finding his compulsion gone followed by the window sliding shut in response. Guardian kept the glare as he heard growls from the vampires to focus onto them getting up dusting their pants. He glared at the vampires to find them in fast speed moves grabbing him by the sides of his restraint and lifting him up. Guardian kept the glare as the vampires roughly hauled him out of the room through dark hallways he seeing people as white blobbed figures. Guardian kept his mouth into a thin line as the hauling stopped followed by an elevator movement felt along with then pushed and pulled out then forced to kneel in the darkness. He kept the glare as the lights blared on he finding himself facing the Queen who formed a pleading expression on her face. 
Guardian glared as the Queen spoke "Sweetie, talk to me about this drink thing you're speaking of."
Guardian felt a coldness feeling take control spoke "Boo bitch!"
He got the Queen grimacing in response as he repeated the comment then added "Baa. You lead the sheep astray with your Goddess discipline all for some pouch connection. Drop the obsession now or I won't restore your feet."
He glared at the Queen feeling the coldness going away followed by groaning loudly from a headache hitting him he felt was the Meritanians scanning him again. Guardian glared in response to get the Queen snarling her familiar line sounding angry while flaring golden eyes of a Compeller. He glared at the Queen to find the vampires had released their holds onto him leaving him kneeling onto the floor. Guardian heard a growl from the vampires followed by the males darting towards the Queen in a fast move. He found her guards two of them getting into the way with golden eyes seen only to watch as the vampires with great strength punched the males' stomach making them groan loudly. He frowned as the vampires went to the Queen still sputtering her gibberish to grab her raising her up her ignoring them. He watched as the vampires placed hands onto her chest and gulped seeing her neck get swollen followed by her groaning loudly. Guardian gulped seeing the vampires bare their teeth followed by biting the Queen's swollen neck and making motions of sucking her. He groaned softly as the vampires cut off the Queen's talk she heard silenced. Guardian kept his mouth into a thin line as he felt a compulsion to free himself obeyed to find the vampires in a fast move licking the Queen's neck he seeing white smears onto the areas. He frowned as he freed his arms only to hear a faint alarm followed by the vampires charging towards him with hands throwing their head gear aimed at him. Guardian found himself compelled to sit still and found the head gear seemed to be metallic hitting his forehead bringing sleepiness which he slid to the floor appearing to be metal and shut his eyes passing out unconscious.

Part eleven: Confrontation

Guardian came to finding he facing Nikolai in Nikolai's office. He found Nikolai was drinking again but noticed the bottle the male was pouring into a glass cup had the name of Guard Beers on it. He found Nikolai didn't seem to notice him staring from his floating position to find the male sitting down behind the desk out of his sight. He heard barking sounds of an Egyptian's voice tone to find Nikolas crawling into the room acting like a Patty gonoid with tongue out and panting loudly. 
Guardian kept watching as Nikolas barked his way to Nikolai behind the desk only to hear "Argh!"
He frowned as Nikolai got up and poured himself a cup of liquid from the bottle before flaring white eyes and flaring the Source into control. Guardian watched as Nikolai waved a hand towards Nikolas he sensed next to the male behind the desk. He heard a loud oof sound followed by hearing nothing from Nikolas. Guardian kept watching Nikolai who tossed the beer bottle towards him right at the heart area like he could see him. He grunted feeling the bottle went through him and sounded of shattering from hitting the wall behind him. Guardian frowned as Nikolai's eyes flared white before remaining their Source look. 
He found Nikolai speaking "So the bitch incarnate decides to visit me."
Guardian frowned to watch as Nikolai turned around to show the Queen standing in the doorway of the office her flaring golden eyes and speaking "I didn't come alone."
He found light shows to find four guards her disciples appearing next to Nikolai in an attempt to grab the male's arms despite he drinking from his cup. Guardian heard a growling noise from Nikolai to find the male shifting form into the Death incarnate skeleton with black hair and raspy breathing as the guards tried to grab him. He found the guards screaming in terror before darting away from Nikolai in response and disappearing in light shows. Nikolai shifted his form back into his Egyptian humanoid form while still drinking from his cup wave a hand towards Nikolas. 
He heard groaning noises to find Nikolas getting up glaring at Nikolai and snarling "Your one sick bastard. I'm not a Patty."
Nikolai spoke "Suit yourself so get out with your bitch excuse of a wife now."
Nikolas in response jabbed a finger onto Nikolai's front the male ignoring him and then walked away going to the Queen to put an arm around her. 
The Queen spoke "Meritanians transport me and Nikolas back to my Mahalia residence now."
Guardian found them both transported out via light shows to find Nikolai turning around growling an angry sound while crunching the glass cup in his black gloved hand. He found Nikolai managed to crunch the cup entirely in pieces before tossing them towards him.
He heard "Get out!"
Guardian found himself out of Nikolai's residence back into the King's bedroom to find Nikolas chained to the bed while the Queen was busy running her tongue over his front the male gasping of pleasure. 
He felt disgust take hold as Nikolas spoke "Free me!"
He stiffened from the voice tone Nikolas used that indicated on something else to find the male repeating his comment over and over while jerking his head back and forth. Guardian frowned as Nikolas kept on jerking onto the chains not able to break them and kept repeating his comment. 
He kept on watching as the Queen crawled off Nikolas to hear "It's Hades. He's trying to take control of him again. He can't take control while he's tied up like that."
Guardian groaned hearing Yerra's comment hear the Queen speaking "Meritanians transport Nikolas out to a jail cell in the brig and have him become Hades there."
He saw Nikolas disappear in a light show to find he facing Mordecai who was glaring at Egypt from the looks of him. 
Guardian didn't say a word as Mordecai jabbed a finger aimed at Egypt's direction and snarled "What did I do to make you angry at me, just to punish me with this joke of fathering your son?"
He glared at Mordecai to hear in response "I'm not angry at you for punishment! I'm furious with you trying to kill your own son!"
Guardian groaned softly hearing that from Egypt to find Mordecai looking in his direction and snarling "Then why is my son spying onto me in my own home? I made sure he wouldn't return by telling Helena where to find him which she got a hold of him as a result."
He gave Mordecai a glare to hear in response "So you acknowledge that he's your son!"
Guardian got Mordecai sitting in his throne chair as a response. He walked up the steps to notice Mordecai rubbing his middle finger on his right hand indicating a ring's status while pausing from walking. 
Guardian spoke after recalling a TV scene on Mordecai's TV monitor "That Egyptian named Jason with the odd eyes was you wasn't it?"
He got Mordecai roaring in response to find the male getting off the throne chair and charging towards him only to find Egypt appearing in view blocking the male's way. 
He heard "You're not hurting him like you oath to the annoying one that you would keep him alive period!"
Guardian gave Mordecai a glare to find the male resumed seated on his throne. He marched up the stairs towards Mordecai and placed hands onto the armrests of the chair. 
Guardian stuck his face into Mordecai's face and spoke "Why is the Egyptians' place of healing claiming that I'm fathered by two males with you pointed out to be the father mostly by their stinking tests?"
He got another roar in response to find Mordecai got him into a choke hold by hands onto his neck and raising him up to dangle his feet. Guardian recalled his karate training proceeded to do it finding himself freed only to get gagged by Mordecai again who resumed the dangles hold. 
He gagged out once he felt paralysis hitting his body from the neck down "Admit it that you're hurt from the lost of your original son killed on your sister's orders."
He got pushed backwards in response to find himself falling in the air only to hit a padded mattress onto his back. Guardian found himself freed of the straitjacket to hear a loud hissing sound of a cat. He jerked open his eyes to find a cat seated on the bed next to him hissing away angrily he found the Queen seated in a wheelchair in the doorway staring at him with disgust seen on her face. 
Guardian sat up without a word and spoke noticing the lamps were on indicating a dark time hour "What's the point of having me contained as a lunatic?"
He glared at the Queen who formed her familiar sugary expression to hear "Sweetie tell me what drink my brother uses to kill off my pouch connection?"
Guardian formed disgust on his face laid down in response only to feel a familiar coldness feeling hitting him. 
He spoke the familiar insult towards the Queen she giving out a gasp “Boo bitch!” 
Guardian sat up finding the Queen pleading "Restore my feet now!"
He spoke in response "Go home to Brittany, Helena. Leave Mahalia-"
Guardian got interrupted "Bastard, I will not leave Mahalia!"
He waved a hand towards the Queen mentally giving her paralysis to her legs and then felt his mind scanned again. 
He grunted as he felt the familiar coldness feeling leave him he mentally spoke "You Meritanians are doing something for her aren't you?"
Guardian heard nothing in response from the Meritanians to feel his mind scanning stop as he glared at the Queen who without a word wheeled herself out of the room. He found one of her disciples slamming the door in response leaving him giving off a sound of disgust. Guardian lay down onto the bed feeling himself clad only in too short pants from the feel of them. He made a motion to get up only to feel the cat getting onto his front to tummy sit purring away while meowing in a happy tone. Guardian groaned and without a word shut his eyes forcing himself to sleep passing out unconscious.

Guardian came to hearing "So what this Mordecai, your brother is going around is referring himself now?"
He frowned for the voice sounded familiar to recognize it as Nikolas to jerk open his eyes finding Hades standing in the room with arms folded facing the Queen still in her wheelchair. 
Guardian sat up with a glare aimed at the Queen who noticed him awake spoke "Nikolai Crimson bastard son of Charles Crimson. Charles himself actually got tossed out the window by my brother doing it. It's just to gain his money fortune to create this awful tasting beer dubbed Guard Beers. It originates from Mahalia's state of Republic State actually. He's big on making production on that beer in question including making sure Columbians is addicted to it enough to keep drinking it. Only Columbians are tolerant of the awful taste of this beer in question. It's very addicting to Columbians actually."
He didn't say a word in response as Hades spoke "anything else, sweetie, you want to admit, hmm?'
He kept mouth into a thin line to find Hades looking at him with arms folded followed by hearing "Talk Victor on what you meant regarding Mordecai drinking to kill off the pouch connection to his sister in question."
Guardian felt his mind scanned to see the familiar cauldron scene fully in his mind followed by light shows to find his arms grabbed by two vampires who lifted him up from the bed. He grunted annoyed sound as the vampires got him up from the bed and got him to kneel in front of the Queen who formed a smirk on her face he seeing laughter in her eyes. 
Guardian kept the glare in response as the Queen spoke "Meritanians you will make Victor's mind easily for me to scan now."
He heard the Compeller's voice tone from the Queen to feel his mind scanned only to find the cauldron scene disappearing from his mind. He grunted as the memory of Nikolai's admittance to a drink in front of Robert flashed into his mind. He again got the familiar cauldron scene blaring in his mind. 
"Son of a bitch!" He heard from the Queen who added "Bastard! Mordecai has been drinking this Guard Beers drink to kill off the pouch connection!"
Guardian got in response "Burn his supply to that with an eater and see how he reacts to it. It'll help the Columbians with their addiction to this Guard Beers' drink in question."
He heard from Hades as he glared at the Queen who spoke in response "Jetsam! Flotsam! Meritanians transport them both to Republic State to where this Guard Beers' plant is and burn it with an eater now!"
Guardian kept his mouth into a thin line as the vampires freed him he feeling they rubbing hands on top of his head before disappearing in a light show. He felt the familiar arm holds of the disciples to glare at the Queen who smirked while shutting her eyes forming a concentration look on her face. He eyed the Queen as he was forced into a standing position by the disciples only to get her gasping of shock followed by the two vampires appearing into light shows growling angrily from their tones. Guardian kept his mouth into a thin line finding the vampires sticking their face into the Queen who opened her eyes forming a frown on her face. 
Guardian got from the Queen in response "Jetsam, Flotsam sucks Guardian and not me."
He heard the Compeller's voice tone found the two vampires obeying to her orders only to give up coughing sounds midway of biting him. He grunted as the vampires licked his neck and again stuck their faces into the Queen while growling angrily. 
Guardian spoke firmly "What's going on to get them angry at you anyway?"
He glared at the Queen who spoke "I should have realized that their afraid of eaters and won't do anything to do with that."
Guardian gave up a sound of disgust to find the vampires grabbing his arms in place of the disciples to get them both growling while glaring at him. 
He ignored the vampires in response to glare at the Queen who spoke "Hades, how are you with eaters-"
She was interrupted by roaring noises from the vampires and hearing them growling noises to see them looking at Hades. 
Guardian glared in response to get from Hades "Says the factory workers used eaters onto them in a fight."
He eyed the Queen who appeared to get a headache by her hand rubbing her forehead followed by speaking "Meritanians restore Herod's mental ability back to him. Take it out of me now."
He exhaled a breath finding her groaning in pain loudly while keeping on rubbing her forehead. 
Guardian glared at the Queen to find Hades kneeling next to her and speaking "Are you in pain from Herod and his joke-"
Only to get interrupted "I can feel my brother again! Guards!"
Guardian exhaled another breath in response to find her disciples arriving into view to kneel in front of her as Hades stood up with arms folded. 
He glared at the Queen who spoke in response "Arrange for the transport to take me to Brittany immediately."
Guardian heard the compelling voice tone of her to find her disciples wheeling her out of the room in response they slamming the door with a bang sound.
He spoke feeling the vampires' hands onto his neck "Did I just dream of that?"
Guardian gulped feeling the vampires' fingers onto his neck were feeling him as he heard nothing in response to his question. He frowned as the vampires proceeded to suck him he finding them still coughing from tasting his blood and licking his neck again. Guardian didn't say a word as the vampires got him to lie down onto the bed which he shut his eyes passing out unconscious. 

Guardian came to facing Mordecai seated in his chair while noticing the male was rubbing his middle finger on his left hand. He sighed and walked up the stairs going to Mordecai to stand once in front of him and kept his mouth shut.
He found Eagle onto his shoulder along with High Priestess rubbing herself against him he hearing "Acknowledge him, Mordecai!"
Guardian kept his mouth shut into a thin line while eyeing Mordecai to speak "Daddy."
He felt himself shocked with what he said as Eagle and High Priestess disappeared followed by Egypt floating into view. He saw Egypt's form shift into the Queen wearing her familiar red dress with her crown on her head.
Guardian stiffened as the Queen spoke "Is he worth living again is he brother dear?"
He frowned while staring at the Queen who shifted into a female Egyptian he recognized as Jason's Luna to find her speaking "What is he worth to you Jason?"
Guardian kept the frown as Luna shifted into a male Egyptian he recognized as White Eyes that spoke "Is there anything worth living for?"
He eyed White Eyes to find Egypt, the Queen, and Luna joined the male all speaking "Is there anything worth living for?"
Guardian focused onto Mordecai that shifted form into Jason complete with the white eyes wearing a ring on his finger he was fiddling with. He frowned as he felt himself wearing clothes abruptly to realize with a start with shock running through him on who he really was. Guardian didn't say a word in response eyed Mordecai that shifted into Nikolai who remained sitting silently. 
He held up a black gloved hand towards Mordecai and spoke "I am the Guardian of Life and Death. I will judge you with my scale on your life."
Guardian found silence in response from the others and Mordecai who kept on sitting in the chair keeping the Nikolai form. He willed Mordecai's life force to come out of the male into his hand. Guardian found his order obeyed to place the life force ball onto the scale and set it equal. He found the scale tipping back and forth finding Egypt not flapping above manipulating it. 
Guardian found the scale tipping into one direction to hear "My son is who I live for!"
He heard that from Mordecai to find the scale tipping in another direction and remained still. 
Guardian spoke "You have been judged to live again. Live you will till I will call you to extinguish your life."
He found himself seated on the chair Mordecai vacated to focus onto a metal gated arch as if drawn flashing like a TV. He eyed it to find it focused onto Queen Helena walking into a jail cell while in a castle. 
There was moaning and groaning heard echoing as Queen Helens spoke "Wake him up now!"
The armored guards were quick to obey throwing a bucket of dirty water onto a prisoner appearing to be a male who opened eyes showing them Egyptian blue while clad in chains and nothing on his form. The male's black hair long in length remained plastered to his face as armored guards thrust him to stand by grabbing his arms.
Queen Helena spoke with sarcasm "Well brother dear, Mordecai how do you like the accommodations, hmm?"
Mordecai spoke in response "You killed my son my only reason for living without trying to destroy you sister dear."
Queen Helena spoke still using the sarcasm "Your son is a useless idiot-"
Mordecai interrupted "You'll know how I'll feel when you have your own offspring to take care of!"
Queen Helena in response gave up a Humph sound followed by walking forwards to grab Mordecai's sensitive part with her hand he hissing loudly from her touch.
Queen Helena spoke "I should have you cut for creating that useless idiot in the first place."
Mordecai hissed out "Unhand me now. It's not proper for sisters to touch brothers there."
Queen Helena spoke "Unhand you because it's not proper? I ought to have you dumped into this deity Lord Lance Richard's employ becoming a servant of him-"
"Warming your bed with him aren't you?" Mordecai interrupted.
Queen Helena released his sensitive part in response and stepped back followed by speaking "Get this miserable excuse of a brother of mine out of this jail cell into where he can get himself cleaned up. He reeks from the smell of him. Yuck!"
Mordecai got freed of his chains and got armored guards holding onto his arms still hauling him out of the jail cell with Queen Helena taking the lead. Mordecai got taken outside and given a good scrubbing followed by given clothes to wear. He glared at his sister as a light flashed to show Lance Richard appearing with all black eyes.
Lance Richard spoke "My disciple is drunk again?"
Queen Helena spoke "I had him in the dungeon-"
Lance Richard interrupted "for being drunk?'
Mordecai glared at Helena with all black eyes as she gulped and spoke "He was trying to kill me for ordering the assassination of his son an idiot dead."
Lance Richard gave Helena a glare and in response spoke "Bring the warring factions to the dining hall now! We'll settle this!"
Mordecai didn't say a word as he and Helena were brought to the dining hall of the castle and forced into a kneeling position. He kept the glare as Lance Richard went to sit down in Helena's throne. 
Lance Richard spoke "So Mordecai tells me your side of the story now."
Mordecai obeyed despite hearing choking sounds from Helena "Our Mother favored my sister my pouch sibling over me when it comes to being the heir to Abydos' throne. I was born first according to our Father. Our Mother wound up having our Father killed by getting him knocked off his horse which he died from it. My sister found my son Morgan a useless idiot her words when calling him and had him killed by chopping off his head by guards doing it."
Lance Richard spoke once Mordecai stopped talking "Tell me your side of the story, Helena."
Helena obeyed despite hearing a choking sound from Mordecai "Sorry brother dear it was an accident that killed our father. I was running after one of our Patties an offspring form that got away from me. I got in front of our father's horse which reared up knocking him off the gonoid in question. The poor horse recognized me and reared up in fear just to avoid hitting me. Our Mother told me a belief that the Goddess Helena I'm named after takes supreme over males hence she insisting that I take the throne over you. I'm sorry I had your son killed. He was an idiot getting himself drunk a lot including charming the females for mating and not taking responsibility for that. He also balked responsibility for various females wounding up carrying as a result. I tried to get him to learn that his idiotic ways wasn't good for him. Your son refused to listen to my warnings when he preyed onto a fellow ruler's daughter and got her carrying. The ruler in question gave me an ultimatum. Have him killed or he'll kill me. I was forced to order his execution. I didn't agree to that but I was thinking of my life when I did that."
Mordecai felt he could breathe again didn't comment a response as he heard grumbling of the kingdom's people gathered around the room. He ignored them to focus onto Lance Richard who got up without a word and went to him lifting him up. He stood as Lance Richard pushed his hair from his face. 
He frowned as Lance Richard spoke "You bare my face, Mordecai. I'll declare you the vessel of me and to take the throne of Abydos. Helena will give up the throne and obey you."
Mordecai didn't say a word as Lance Richard disappeared in a light show to hear gasps from the crowd. He folded his arms forming the familiar symbol with his hand for his sister to see indicated that he forgiven her she giving him the crown in response. Mordecai found her folding her arms and giving him the familiar symbol with her hand. He sighed recognized the look in her eyes indicated that she was genuine as he held the crown.
Mordecai heard "Hail to-"
"Oh no you don't!" The people were interrupted by a loud voice. 
He saw Helena gasp forming a glare as armored males came into the room thrusting swords around him and his sister. He glared as a male entered the room with a crown on his head he noticing the male was smirking.
Mordecai kept the glare as Helena was heard "King Brittan! I did what you asked! Had the violator killed!"
He exhaled a breath hearing Helena's words as King Brittan in response gave up a chuckle sound and spoke "The kingdom of Abydos is now under me King Brittan ruler of Brittany and all of her territories. Guards cut off the heads of Mordecai and Helena now."
Mordecai found his arms grabbed and forced to kneel as he heard from Helena "You will lose a kingdom Mahalia."
He willed forwards the Source as he heard the creepy voice tone of Lance Richard spoken through Helena as the sword he sensed went down onto his neck. He found his light extinguished 

Guardian continued to watch as the scene shifted to a couple he recognized as Nikolas and his Mother mating he from a previous TV monitored scene saw it was twin to it. He then saw the couple shifted into Nikolai mating with his Mother who later got up once the mating was done a few suns later to throw up in the expeller. 
Guardian kept watching as Nikolai dialed a phone speaking 'Sent for medical personal to this room now."
Nikolai heard throwing up from the bathroom to sigh and didn't say a word as there was a door knocking sound. He went to the door making sure he was clad in his bathrobe to find medics there which he jabbed a finger at the bathroom and didn't say a word. Nikolai sat down in the armchair hearing the noises from the medics attending to Victoria Lynn who was still sick as usual. He glared as the medics came out one with a frown look that gave him a glare. He glared in response while willing forwards the Source. 
He got the medic giving him a bow and speaking "Respects. She's pregnant hence her sickness."
Nikolai didn't say a word in response to hear "You better be doing something to help me raise the baby."
He sighed hearing Victoria's sneering voice tone to find her in the room wearing a bathrobe and glaring at him. He glared at her in response as she threw up in front of him before darting into the bathroom he again hearing her expelling again. 
Nikolai spoke firmly "Just get out now! I'll handle her and her pregnancy now!"
He found his order obeyed despite he using the creepy voice tone of the Source. He went into the bathroom to find Victoria leaning over the toilet to thrust a bare hand onto her forehead. 
Nikolai spoke in response "You will think the baby is Nikolas Visser's and will forget mating with me and forget seeing me. So go to sleep and wake up when I slam the door to this bedroom."
Nikolai found his order obeyed by Victoria collapsing onto the floor which he ignored her lying there and left the bathroom. He went to his clothes to put them on including taking his bathrobe and left the room shutting the door with a bang sound.

Guardian found the scene changed to show Victoria Lynn heavily pregnant groaning loudly while in a hospital he saw had Mahalia's symbols of it. He continued to watch as Victoria Lynn pushed out a baby boy followed by again pushing out another baby that appeared to be a girl. 
He heard from the doctor as the nurses took the babies away "What names do you wish to refer the babies as?"
He heard from Victoria Lynn in response "Call the boy Victor and the girl Andreea Luna. It's my actual name despite the stage name of Victoria Lynn used."
Guardian stiffened hearing the name of Andreea Luna to find the doctor giving out a loud gasp and speaking "Was that you the one who brought the cure to Megiddo's people?"
He heard "Ugh yes that was me."
Guardian kept watching to find the Mahalian natives giving Victoria Lynn lots of attention while she was standing having her picture taken while wearing a dress that nearly bared her breasts. He kept on watching as Victoria Lynn smiled while holding onto the arm of a male he recognized was of a famous Mahalian actor named Liam but not sure of his last name. He kept on watching as the TV monitor went blank showing clouds instead of anything. 
He frowned to hear "Acknowledge him!"
Guardian eyed Egypt to find her floating next to him that repeated her words he finding who she was talking about. 
He saw Nikolai appear in front of him naked and heard Egypt repeat her words “Acknowledge him!” 
He spoke firmly "Father, I acknowledge you."
Guardian heard a clock chime bell ringing loudly only to hear Egypt speaking "He did what was required, All Seeing One."
He frowned as he found nothing in answer to Egypt's words only to hear silence from the clock. Guardian found hands onto his shoulder to feel compelled to stand up followed by pushed forwards off the chair into the darkness. He wound up falling face first to come to feeling himself wailing away like a baby. Guardian heard another wailing like noise sounding loudly twin to his but in a feminine voice tone. He felt the feeling went away followed by hearing singing of someone humming a lullaby. Guardian frowned hearing the humming followed by feeling himself back into his adult body lying on something like stone. He heard car honking noises sounding annoyed to him to shake sleepiness from his eyes to find a cop standing over him and giving him a golden eyed glare. Guardian didn't say a word in response got up in a fast move finding he lying on the middle of the sidewalk in Megiddo's familiar capital city. He sighed and didn't say a word towards the cop who kept the golden eyed glare. Guardian walked away in response only to feel a compulsion to go into a direction. He obeyed to find himself led to Nikolai's familiar building to groan loudly in response. 
Guardian walked inside the lobby to find Robert in sight sleeping in his wheelchair that woke up sputtering "Ooh, I'm trying to sleep."
He walked up to Robert and gently patted the male onto the cheek waking him up some more. 
Guardian got from Robert who focused onto him "Ooh its wannabe back from his walk. Father wants you in his office immediately. Follow me."
He sighed and found Robert leading the way to Nikolai's personal elevator to hear the male using Source orders to get the thing moving to his Father's residence. He didn't comment a response followed Robert out of the elevator to find Jones there that without a word led the way to Nikolai's office. Guardian heard multiple hissing sounds of cats within the room once in vicinity to frown and went inside hearing the door slam shut behind him. He stood finding Nikolai had back to him drinking from a cup from his arm movements. 
Guardian spoke "You wanted to see me?"
He frowned to hear a familiar crunch of glass to see orange liquid spurt from Nikolai to get the male turning around giving him a Source look. He got Nikolai's familiar finger gesture indicating on licking the floor. Guardian felt disgust take hold gave up the noise as he kneeled and gave the wooden floor several licks he feeling cat hair getting into his mouth. 
He spat out the cat hair and kept his kneeling pose with arms folded to get Nikolai speaking "What do you know of your origins, hmm?"
Guardian spoke as if compelled "Not a thing other than this Victoria Lynn and my father Nikolas Visser got together and made me."
He got from Nikolai hissing out "Nikolas Visser isn't your Father, I am."
Guardian gaped staring at Nikolai who continued speaking "Nikolas Visser and this Victoria Lynn met for a private mating game which there was nothing involving offspring forming from the union in question. Nikolas in question turned out to be medically unable to father offspring through females. Victoria Lynn in question wound up meeting me soon after Nikolas dumped her for Helena Crimson, my sister in question. It was when you were created from the both of us mating each other."
Guardian gasped as Nikolai continued "My sister in case you want to know is my pouch sibling. She was living in Mahalia a refugee from being declared a vessel of a deceased Queen she named after in Brittany. It's from how she looked involving this Queen. The vessel status got too much for my sister hence she went to Mahalia to get her privacy in question. Nikolas wound up trying to pursue her heavily till she was forced to escape him going to my residence island in Megiddo."
He clamped his mouth shut as Nikolai continued speaking "Nikolas was kind of all over the place regarding charming females to mate with him and not focused onto marriage. Some sort of womanizer to the point that Parliament kicked him out of Kingship position and went with an elected official in his place. Brittany quit at the time of trying to make any retake attempts but now their still doing it at the moment."
Guardian spoke as if compelled "What's going on with Helena now?"
He clamped his mouth shut to eye Nikolai who spoke in response "She's back in Brittany trying to tolerate this vessel of a Queen Goddess status at the moment. It's not easy for her but I do know how she feels. I have been declared the vessel of a male deity answering to the name of Lance Richard. I'm required to travel all over Egyptia whenever the Master Organization's group members request my presence for being their Deity Lord in question."
Guardian frowned finding nothing coming to mind about Helena as he eyed Nikolai which he got up only to hear "I didn't say that you could get up, my son."
He sighed and forced himself to kneel in response to get Nikolai making his familiar gesture which he obeyed to lick the floor spitting out cat hair. 
Guardian quit once Nikolai spoke "Door unlock."
He heard a thump noise behind him to hear the door open followed by hearing "How's baby brother accepting the news, Daddy?"
Guardian turned around to glare at Robert who was standing with arms folded the male wearing metallic objects on his legs. He felt something was odd regarding Robert's standing position but couldn't bring it up to his mind. Guardian shifted to glare at Nikolai he recalling that he never called any male father raiser by the fatherly words instead only called them by their first names. 
He kept the glare as Nikolai spoke "He took the news fine, Charles."
Guardian recalled the name of Robert to feel confused as his brother spoke "My name is Robert and don't forget it. I hate that name of Charles Crimson Junior. I don't care to be known as that drunkard uncle of yours drinking himself drunk to get thrown out of the window. Yuck."
He glared at Nikolai in response who spoke "Charles, my uncle despite his flaws of being a drunk was a father figure to me. I didn't have anybody to father me despite my own father not being around busy being a womanizer."
Guardian frowned as Robert he figured he'll refer him spoke "You still upset about Owen Visser being your own Dad and ignoring you and Auntie Helena in question despite you born of someone else than his wife?"
He frowned as Nikolai in response spoke "Owen Visser despite his flaws was more interested in feeding his thing then doing anything for me and my sister in question. Hence the both of us adopted by Charles Crimson when it was obvious he didn't have an heir for his fortune. He took the both of us out of the orphanage in Brittany and brought us to Megiddo to raise us as his heirs. I suspect that his drunken bout of throwing himself out the window was on purpose when it was obvious he was dying away from some wasting disease of his mind. The hospital said he was diagnosed before he did his death stunt appears he chose his way to get to the Guardian of Life and Death in question."
Guardian frowned sensing something odd about Nikolai's wording as Nikolai added "So Robert shouldn't you be in the pool working on your leg strength hmm?"
He eyed Robert who pulled out a stick appearing to be a walking stick and without a word stiffly walked out of sight. 
Guardian eyed Nikolai to speak "What happened to him anyway?"
He eyed Nikolai who leaned against the desk speaking "That's another story for Robert as he wishes to be called to tell you, Victor. I'm not at liberty to say what the story is. Robert told me he wants to tell you himself of that story. Ask him when the time is right. So get out of my office, Victor, and leave me to drink my juice in peace."
Guardian obeyed hearing the name of Victor he figured "Must be my name."
He found the butler shutting the doors behind him to hear multiple meows sounding faint once the doors were shut. 
Guardian spoke "How many cats does he have anyway?"
He eyed the butler who spoke "The name is Harrington, Sir. I gave up counting cats whenever asked. The Master has various cats all over the place."
He spoke "Well I meant living gonoid cats’ not themed cats."
Guardian got from Harrington in response "Ah the Master has one cat named Annie that is rather hissing towards visitors and other people. She only likes the Master and will only show herself to him. Don't ask me on how the Master got Annie. I heard a rumor among the Master Organization that someone got a towel with his scent on it and threw it in a den of cats. Reportedly some cat room in a cat sanctuary actually. Anyway none of the cats expressed interests in the towel as the rumor said until Annie was put into the room. The rumor stated she made a beeline towards the towel and rubbed herself with it including playing with it. I heard that's how the Master acquired Annie herself. Finicky cat she's turned to be. Only showing herself to her Master and balking on being around for the staff whenever food is put out for her. Oh-"
He heard blared "Harrington!"
Guardian sighed hearing it announced to find the butler without a word entering Nikolai's office slamming the doors. 
He spoke out loud "Just what am I supposed to be doing, such as finding my own life's purpose?"
Guardian heard in response "Figure it out yourself smarty. You have your own life to live. You should figure out your own paths to live and figure out what to do with your own life. Live it. Don't confront the Guardian of Life and Death again till he calls for you."
He exhaled a breath hearing that sounding in his mind abruptly along with confusion hitting him he not sure where the voice came from. 
Guardian spoke out loud "Well live life. Fine I might as well do that. But first I got to figure out what Father has in mind for me to do here."
He shrugged and felt like walking further into the residence to find himself going into a direction he thinking to himself "Well life shouldn't be a problem anyway. I aim to live the best I can."
Guardian wound up bumping into a female reading a book that did a double take look seeing him. 
He frowned sensing something familiar about her only to get her speaking 'Pouch brother?"
Guardian spoke realizing who the female was from shock hitting him "Pouch sister it's you. I should have realized when I saw you."
He didn't say a word as his pouch sister in response hugged him in a tight hold he hugging her back. 
He heard sobbing sounds from his sister to hear "My name is Andreea Luna. Is your name, Victor?'
Guardian spoke in response "It's my name. Isn't your name the name of that Mahalian actress married to this actor Liam in Mahalia?"
He frowned eyeing Andreea who spoke in response quitting her tears "Mother had you and I adopted out separately within Mahalia despite our Father managed to get people to adopt us both by his own people."
He spoke recalling the memory as if compelled "Yes I remember that adoption bit. I do recall something hitting me involving you which I figured it out."
Guardian got from Andreea as she quit hugging him he doing the same "Yes it's our pouch connection our Father told me of it at a meeting. He knows what we're feeling from him having that connection himself."
He sighed and spoke as Andreea took his arm and walked in the hallway "So tell me your life living in Mahalia."
Guardian got Andreea speaking his words at the same time he spoke them. 
He sighed and spoke as she spoke "You first."
Guardian spoke as she spoke "Life is going to be interesting isn't it?"
He sighed as Andreea sighed and without a word spoke as she spoke "Let's write it down."
Guardian eyed Andreea who eyed him back and without a word found her leading the way to the kitchen where there was a laptop computer sitting on the table. He sat down as Andreea sat down in front of the computer she typing away he recalling his life on Mahalia as if compelled. 
He sighed recalling "I was raised by a midwife all over Mahalia till a drunk driver took her out in a car accident. The drunk driver died in the process. Police said he was too drunk to survive the accident. Anyway I wound up graduating from high school in Victoria State at age nineteen despite home schooled all my life till my Mother raiser passed away. Nikolai got a hold of me after the graduation ceremony to get me to Megiddo to meet him. I wound up balking on going to Megiddo till I turned twenty one is when I went. My reason for falling asleep on the sidewalk was fainting from staying up so late and not sleeping. I was too excited to meet my father. I wound up walking to his building instead of taking the car to there as ordered by my Father. I fell asleep as a result."
He focused onto Andreea to find her speaking "So tell me of your life in Mahalia? I'll type it down along with my own story. I warn you I used various tall tale jokes into my story to make it seem fiction. It's just to hide our identities from the public. I'm hoping on having a writing career at the moment by myself with no help from our Father."
Guardian began the tale telling Andreea a detailed version of his story despite compelled to speak various tall tales as she typed.
She interrupted he heard "You want to hear the story I typed down?"
Guardian spoke "Tell me anyway I might know of it actually."
Andreea spoke in response.
Guardian found Andreea paused from her talk to frown staring at her as she cleared her throat speaking "Robert, you want something?"
He found Robert in the room who hobbled towards them both speaking "How's the story 'A Stranger's Fear' going anyway?"
He looked at Andreea questioningly to hear her speaking "Robert told me that he had a scary horseback ride in the jungle with dinosaurs. I wound up making up a story dubbed 'A Stranger's Fear' in the process. 
Daddy said ‘I heard of the story.’
He claims that parts of it are true involving an ancestor of the family named Robert O'Neil who our big brother named himself after."
Guardian frowned forming it on his lips as Andreea added "Just listen to the story I'm telling from what I could get from our Father regarding Charles Crimson himself. I invented some parts of the story myself just to fill in the blanks using what I used from a previous story."
Guardian noticed Robert leaning against the cane spoke "You want my seat?"
He frowned as Robert shook his head and heard Andreea continue on her story ignoring his question.

Guardian eyed Nikolai who had a cup of orange liquid in his hand and sipped it in front of him which he looked away to stare at Andreea with a frown giving her a glare.
Andreea he glared at looked at her laptop and spoke "I have something typed down on Lance Richard's point of view after he was returned to his Isle of Forbidden."
He kept the glare as he heard "Just tell the story anyway. I don't think Victor has heard it."
Guardian sighed hearing Robert to eye Andreea typing onto her laptop followed by her speaking he listening.

Guardian found Andreea looking at Nikolai and adding "That's about it regarding Lance Richard's point of view. Anything you want to add?"
He shifted to eye Nikolai finding Robert seated on the counter with arms folded a glare at their Father. 
Nikolai spoke in response showing Egyptian blue eyes "Sorry I'm not a liberty to say what else happened. Lance Richard told me to keep my trap shut. He has secrets he doesn't care for Egyptians to find out anyway. I oath him as his vessel I would be silent about them."
Guardian heard from Andreea speaking "Anyway here's the story 'A Stranger's Fear' I typed. You want to hear of it?"
He frowned as Nikolai spoke in response "Just tell Victor the story anyway."
Guardian found her obeying to listen.

Guardian sighed once Andreea finished the story. 
He focused onto Andreea as if drawn to find her speaking "Daddy listen to the wild story Victor told me regarding his life as named as Guard Beers."
He sighed again and eyed Nikolai who spoke "I have all the time in the world to listen. I like your stories, Andreea. So tell me what Victor said."
Guardian groaned and didn't protest as Andreea proceeded to tell their Father the tale he told her. He found she managed to type everything verbatim and was repeating it via the laptop computer.

Epilogue

Herod got into the car relieved to be free from his prison only to smell gas got out of the vehicle as it exploded in an eater fire. He felt pain hitting the back of his head grunted to find himself passing out unconscious. 
Herod came to finding himself seated on a throne chair hearing himself speaking "I am the Guardian of Life and Death. I will judge you with my scale on your life."
He found Egypt floating next to him as he spoke "Begin the judgment."
Herod found a metal gated arch float into view showing a male he recognized as Victor speaking to a female, he saw, was to his disgust the Queen, who was typing away on a laptop. He continued to watch as Victor spoke his story seemingly lengthy he listening.

The TV monitor showed Victor telling his story regarding the Guardian of Life and Death went back to showing clouds. Egypt floated next to the Guardian of Life and Death sat in his throne chair. He sensed, she saw, he wasn't alone to find her floating next to him with her wings flapping. She gave him a glare in response. 
The Guardian of Life and Death spoke "What are you angry about this time, Egypt?"
Egypt in response spoke "Herod."
She heard him speak "Don't mention that name to me again. Herod is dead light extinguished. I'm now the Guardian of Life and Death. I will judge with my scale on your people's life."
Egypt rolled her eyes in response seeing Herod didn't get her message. 
She recalled fully to herself "The Guardian of Life and Death isn't a position for my people to hold but me getting them worthy to live again actually. I have to get the current Guardian of Life and Death, Herod to acknowledge my message including trying to get him to live again before the All Seeing One's deadline of that passes. Ugh. Here we go again my battle to keep my people living alive in Egyptia despite the All Seeing One, Ra calling them home. Argh!"
Egypt didn't comment a response to sensing the All Seeing One watching with a clock ticking sounds heard she groaned in response. She sighed and focused onto the battle of saving Herod's life from having light extinguished.

The End?
