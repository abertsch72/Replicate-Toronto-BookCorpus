Prologue


The music in the club was beginning to give her a headache, but Melody ignored it. She was about to go to an after-party with the band members of Venom, who’d just finished their last encore at Club Nightshade. She was also pretty confident that if she played her cards right, she’d be in the lead vocalist’s arms before dawn. 
Slade. 
Just thinking about him made her tingle all over. Damn, the guy was hawt and had a voice that made her want to jump his bones. With those hypnotic green eyes, and that sexy infamous half-smile of his, she knew she wasn’t the only girl lusting after him in the club. But she’d definitely mastered the skill of flirting and had eventually gotten Slade’s attention. She’d done the pouty lip thing and made sure he’d gotten an eyeful of cleavage, dancing as close to the stage as possible, twerking with her girlfriends until every guy in the club had been drooling. It had obviously worked, because she’d gotten a note from one of the waitresses with an invite to some party being hosted by the owner of the club, complements of the band. Thankfully, she’d gotten the fake I.D. the week before or there was no way she’d have been able to step inside of the club, let alone party with the band afterwards.   
Leaning forward, she applied another layer of dark cherry gloss to her lips, and then fluffed out her long blond hair. She stood back and smiled, recalling how Slade’s eyes had been transfixed on those same lips. Obviously, he liked the rich crimson color.
“You ready to go, Melody?” asked her best friend Taylor, who was frantically texting someone on her phone. “It’s getting late and I told Ricky I’d stop by after we left the club.” She looked up and giggled. “Booty call, baby.”
“What about us?” asked Veronica, looking pissed. “I thought we’d agreed that I was staying at your place tonight, Taylor?”
“You’re welcome to wait in the car.  It won’t take long,” she replied. “He’s like a jack-hammer.”
Melody and Veronica looked at each other, and then burst out laughing.
Taylor bit her lower lip. “Actually, now that I think about it, I’m not in the mood for thirty seconds of Ricky. You know, I’d almost rather go eat somewhere. We could go back to that diner up the street. Remember how awesome their food was last time we went?”
Veronica’s eyes lit up. “Ruth’s? Girl, I’m starving. Let’s do it.”
“Uh… sorry. I can’t, guys,” said Melody. “I’m meeting someone.”
Taylor raised an eyebrow. “What do you mean? Who?!”
Melody stared at her side-view in the mirror, sucking in her stomach and thrusting out her chest. She was glad she’d worn her new leopard-colored pushup bra with the matching thong. She wondered if Slade liked animal print. “Wish I could tell you, but it’s kind of a secret.”
“Excuse me,” replied Veronica, putting her hands on her hips. “We’re your best friends. You have to tell us!” 
She hesitated, wanting to share the news, but her friends had big mouths. “I can’t. Look, I’ll tell you tomorrow. I just don’t want to blow my chances tonight.”
“Blow your chances? He’s not married or anything, is he?” asked Taylor.
“Please,” replied Melody, rolling her eyes. “I’m not into married guys. I just can’t tell you who it is because I promised not to say anything.”
“That’s just weird,” said Veronica.
“If you knew who it was, you wouldn’t think so,” she replied with a sly smile.
“Are you going to be okay? I feel uncomfortable taking off like this and not knowing exactly what’s up,” said Taylor.
Melody dug into her Louis Vuitton purse and took out a small bottle of perfume. She spritzed some into the air and then stepped into the fruity mist. “Don’t worry about me. Everything is totally cool.”
Veronica studied her face. “He’s not some freak, is he? You know him pretty well?”
Melody smiled. “Of course, and he’s not a freak. Chill out, guys.”
Veronica sighed. “We’re just worried about you.”
Melody zipped up her purse. “Look, I appreciate your concern, but I’ll be fine. Take off and get some breakfast.” She winked. “While I go and get me some dessert.”
Veronica laughed. “Girl, I hear that. Next time get some for me, too. I haven’t had sex since Jerome and I broke up last summer.”
“We know,” said Taylor. “You complain about it at least twice a day.”
“You would too if it wasn’t for the ‘Jack Hammer’,” she replied. 
“Speaking of… maybe I should meet up with Ricky,” said Taylor, biting her lower lip.
“Oh, hell no,” replied Veronica. “I’m not going to be the only one not getting some tonight.”
Taylor laughed. “Fine. I’m sure the food will be more satisfying than thirty seconds of Ricky anyway.”
“Especially if you order the cheesecake again,” said Melody. “Remember how much you loved it?”
“Mm… that’s right. Well, call us tomorrow,” said Taylor, dropping her phone into her satchel. “And give us the dirt.”
“You know it,” she replied, hugging her. Melody turned to Veronica and hugged her as well. “I’ll fill you both in on all the steamy details.” 
“You’d better. But not before noon,” said Taylor. “I’m going to hold you to it.”
After Veronica and Taylor left, Melody glanced at her reflection one more time. 
This time, Slade, you sexy bastard, she thought, you’re going to make me sing. All night long…

 
Chapter One 

Chelsey


“Chelsey, wake up.”
I opened my eyes and groaned when I looked at the alarm clock. “Mom, I have two more hours to sleep, and I was up late studying. What the heck?”
She switched on the light and stepped closer to my bed.  “Sorry, honey,” she replied, looking grim. “I wasn’t sure if this could wait.”
I rubbed my left eye. “If what could wait?”
She pulled her light blue robe in tighter. “Your Aunt Jody called,” she said. “Melody didn’t come home last night.”
Now that woke me up. “What?” I asked, sitting up.
She sat down on the edge of my bed. “I guess she went out with Taylor and Veronica around eight o’clock last night. That was the last time Jody saw her. She’s just going nuts now and doesn’t know what to do. Have you talked to Melody recently?”
I shook my head. “No. Not since her grad party.”
 The truth was that my cousin and I didn’t always see eye-to-eye. In fact, ever since we graduated last June from high school, we’d barely been on speaking terms. I figured it was because she was still pissed at me after I’d given her crap about sneaking shots of tequila at her graduation party. Afterwards, she’d puked her brains out, but it hadn’t changed how annoyed she’d been at me. I guess that ratting her out hadn’t really helped either. The only reason I’d blown the whistle was because my aunt had backed me into a corner when she’d noticed that her bottle of Patron was missing. I wasn’t very good at lying, and she’d known that. “I’m sure she’s fine,” I said, thinking about all of the other times Melody had pulled stuff. “I mean, she’s eighteen now anyway. She probably crashed at Taylor’s or Veronica’s.” After getting wasted, I wanted to say, but held back.
“Nope. Jody called them. They haven’t seen her since last night.”
I yawned. “Well, where did they go?”
My mom pushed her dark bangs to the side. “They went to over to Shore Lake to go watch some rock band play.”
That was surprising. Although Shore Lake was a tourist spot, it wasn’t exactly known for concerts or live bands. “Where?” 
“I think the place was called Nightshade or something. Anyway, they said she’d told them that someone else was giving her a ride home.”
I’d heard of Club Nightshade, which was in the next town over, but had never actually been there. A lot of the kids in school had raved about the place. Some of them had even snuck in with fake I.D.’s when it wasn’t Teen-Night. Supposedly, you could get anything in that place if you knew who to talk to – drugs, alcohol, even… sex. “I didn’t know they had bands playing there. I thought it was all hip-hop from the radio.”
“I guess not.” She raised her eyebrows. “Have you been to that place?”
I rolled my eyes. “No. It’s definitely not my scene. Besides, who has time for clubs when I barely have enough time for homework and studying?” I was a freshman at U.M.T. and my life was filled with studying, homework, and more studying. I barely had time to sleep or eat. 
She stood back up. “Well, maybe she met a boy…”
I smirked. “That’s what I’m thinking.” Plus, she had a reputation. She went through more guys than I did paper. 
“Well, I just wish she’d answer her mom’s phone calls and texts.”
I decided to lay it on the table for her. “Mom, look, I’m going to be honest – Melody is a major partier. Heck, I know for a fact that last night wasn’t Teen-Night at that place. So, she would have had to have gotten in with a fake I.D. She probably drank and then went home with some horny jerk.”
She scowled. “Well, that certainly doesn’t make me feel any better.”
“Sorry, but even you know that I’m probably right. Did her friends say who was taking her home?”
“No. She wouldn’t say; said it was a secret, but that she’d tell them later.”
I frowned. “Hmm… that’s kind of weird.”
“I know. Taylor seems to think that it might have been one of the guys in the band. I guess she has a crush on the singer, and had been trying to get his attention the entire night.”
“It probably worked,” I said. Melody had to be the prettiest girl in Beaver Creek. With her blond hair, curves, and dazzling smile, she’d always been popular with the guys in school. If she set her sights on someone at the club, chances were that they’d be putty in her hands. 
“Boys in bands are trouble,” she replied. “Obviously, this just proves it.”
“She’s not exactly an angel either, mom. She’s probably in bed with him right now.”
“Chelsey!”
I shrugged. “What? You know it’s true.”
She sighed. “I know. I just don’t want to think about your cousin having sex.”
I crawled back under my covers. “I know, but I wouldn’t worry too much about Melody, mom. If she was crushing on the singer, chances are she’s with him and not thinking about Aunt Jody right now.” 
“You’re probably right. She is eighteen.”
I yawned again. “Just go back to bed, mom. I’m sure she’ll be home in a couple of hours, puking and getting bawled out by Aunt Jody.”
Chuckling, she touched my shoulder. “I’m just glad that you’re responsible and don’t give me or your father problems like that.”
I closed my eyes and smiled. “You’re welcome. Now let me sleep so I can get on with my humdrum life.”
“It’s not humdrum,” she protested. “You’re preparing for the future.” 
I opened up one eye. “Mom, it’s boring. All I do is take tests and study, so that I can take more tests. It’s kind of lame.”
“You really think so? I don’t know, I’d love to go back to my college years,” she replied wistfully. “It’s where I met your father, you know.”
I’d heard the story many times. My mom had played hard-to-get and my dad had pursued her relentlessly, until she’d finally agreed to go out with him. Five years later, they eloped in Hawaii, after she became pregnant with me.  “I know.”
“Just hang in there, Chelsey. We’re proud of you and it’s going to pay off someday. Plus, if you’re going to be a Forensic Investigator, your life will eventually be anything but plain and boring.” 
“Yeah, I’m sure.”
“Well, I’ll let you get back to bed,” she said, squeezing my foot through the blanket. 
 “Make sure I’m up before seven,” I called out as she walked out of my bedroom.
She turned around. “I will. I won’t be able to sleep until I hear from Jody.”
After she closed my bedroom door, I thought about Melody. Growing up, we’d been close, even though she had always been a little bossy. Even at a young age, she’d always known exactly what she’d wanted and used everything she could to get her way. Chances were, my cousin had gotten her way again, tonight, and was getting her freak on with that singer she’d been lusting after. I had to admit, part of me was a little envious.
 

Chapter Two

Chelsey

When my alarm went off a couple of hours later, I dragged myself out of bed and took a hot shower. Wiping the steam from the mirror, I glanced at my reflection – pale skin, long auburn hair, and hazel eyes. I thought I was pretty average, except for the fact that I was barely five-feet and had a hard time finding shoes that fit, because my feet were so small. I wore a size three and had a heck of a time shopping for shoes that didn’t light up or feature a pink pony. 
After I slipped on a blue Henley and khakis, I grabbed a brush and pulled my hair up into a ponytail. When I was finished in the bathroom, I grabbed my backpack and headed downstairs to the kitchen.
“Good morning,” said my mom, who was sitting at the counter, drinking coffee behind her laptop. 
“Morning,” I said, opening up the refrigerator. I cleared my throat. “Heard anything from Aunt Jody yet?”
“She hasn’t heard from your cousin yet.”
I pulled the orange juice out and glanced at her. There were shadows under her eyes and she looked worn out. She’d obviously been up the entire night. “Well, it’s still pretty early.”
She removed her reading glasses and rubbed the bridge of her nose. “Yeah, I know.”
“Don’t worry, she’ll show up,” I said, pouring myself a glass of juice. 
“I hope so. You know, it’s dangerous out there in the world, especially for women. A guy could slip something into your drink, follow you home, rape –”
 “Yes, I know,” I cut in. I knew I was being snippy, but I’d already heard it many times before. My mom was a court reporter and after hearing so many horrible cases, she was a little paranoid. “You don’t have to tell me. I’m one of the last people you need to worry about.”
She reached over the counter and squeezed my hand. “Chelsey,” she said, staring into my eyes. “I’ll always worry about you. I’m your mother and you’re a pretty girl. There are a lot of bad people in this world.” She sighed. “I just want you to be safe.”
“I know. I get it, mom,” I said as she released my hand. “Don’t get me wrong, I’m grateful that you worry about me. But, I’m not Melody, okay? I’m responsible and certainly not stupid.”
“You don’t have to be stupid to be a victim,” she replied. “But making the right decisions can certainly help lessen your chance of becoming one.”
I put my glass into the sink and picked up my backpack. “That’s why you don’t have to worry about me. I always make the right decisions.”
“Right,” she said, her hazel eyes sparkling. “Joking aside, I am very proud of you, honey. Just keep doing what you’re doing.”
“I will,” I replied as I walked out of the kitchen. “See you when I get home.”
“Bye, honey.”

***

The day seemed to drag, and by the time I was finished with my biology class, I couldn’t wait to get home. It was Friday and I had a weekend to do four days of homework, but I was used to it and didn’t really care. I was going to take a night off and go to a movie with a friend of mine, Susan. I hadn’t seen her in over two weeks, my brain was mush, and I desperately needed some time away from all things “school”.
“Hey,” I said, walking into the house. I dropped my backpack next to the front door. 
Both of my parents looked up and I could tell from their expressions that something was wrong. 
“What is it?” I asked, surprised that my dad was home so early. Being a bankruptcy lawyer, I never saw him walk in the door earlier than seven.
“Your cousin is still missing,” he said, putting an arm around my mom’s shoulder. “She hasn’t returned anyone’s calls and Jody is frantic.”
I frowned. “Where is Aunt Jody?”
My mom, who was also clearly upset, looked up. “She’s at home. Grandma is with her.”
“Oh.”
 Sighing, she stood up and stretched her arms above her head. “Your dad and I are heading over there, too, pretty soon. Would you like to come with?”
“Uh, sure,” I replied. “I have to call Susan, though. We were going to see a movie tonight, but I’ll definitely cancel.”
“No, don’t cancel,” she said. “You should still go with her. You haven’t gotten out in a while and a movie would be good. Besides, we don’t even know for sure if she’s really missing.”
“Are you sure?” I asked, still thinking that Melody was just being Melody – selfish and irresponsible.  
“Your mother is right,” said my dad, running a hand through his short hair, which was the same color as mine. “This might be nothing to worry about. Chances are that she’ll walk through her front door any minute.”
I glanced at my mother again. “Are you sure? I don’t have to go.”
“Yes. We’ll call you if there really is a problem,” replied my mom.  
“Okay,” I replied, a little relieved. I really didn’t want to be there when Melody got home and was hollered at. She’d probably blame me for her getting into trouble.
Dad looked at his watch. “We should get going. There’s a hockey game I’d like to watch at four. If we’re lucky, we’ll make it there before the game starts.”
My mom’s eyes widened. “Richard!”
He grinned sheepishly. “Sorry, Mary. Hey, it gives me something to do while you guys wait for her to come home.”
“And if she doesn’t?” asked my mom, folding her arms across her chest.
 “I know, I’ll TiVo it,” he said, walking toward the stairs leading to the family room.
My mom smirked and shook her head. “I don’t know what he’d do without cable,” she replied, turning back to me. 
“No doubt.”
“There’s some leftover lasagna from last night in the refrigerator,” she said, picking up her purse from the coffee table. “Unless you’re going to grab a bite to eat before the movie?”
“No. We’ll just eat popcorn.”
“Okay.” She opened up the closet and took out her camel-colored Uggs. “I’ll text you when she comes home, or,” she frowned, “if we find out that she really is missing.”
“I’m sure she’ll be fine. It’s Melody, mom.”
“I know.” She zipped up her boots and then walked over to me. “Have fun at the movies,” she said, kissing the top of my head.
“I will. Look at you in those heeled boots,” I grinned. “You must be five-two now.” 
My lack of height came from my mother. 
“You think so?” she replied, staring down at them.
My dad walked back upstairs. “Oh, I like those, Mary,” he said, wiggling his eyebrows. “Are they new?”
“No, I just never wear them.”
“They’re cute,” I said.
“Cute? They’re sexy. You can wear them in the bed any time you want,” he teased.
“Oh, my God,” I groaned. “You’re gross.”
He laughed and grabbed his car keys from the credenza. “Lock the door when you leave, Pumpkin.”
“I will.”
He turned to me and his face became serious. “Watch yourselves. I’m pretty sure this thing with Melody is nothing to be concerned about, but you and Susan are both good-looking, young girls and… well, there are monsters out there.”
“Yes,” I replied, trying not to roll my eyes. As far as I was concerned, both of them were way too overprotective.
He put his hands on my shoulders and squeezed. “Honey, I know you’re tired of the same old spiel, but you know, being a prosecutor I’ve come face-to-face with some real dirt-bags. The absolute scum of the earth. The worst part is that there are so many out there who have yet to be caught.” His forehead wrinkled. “I just worry about you.”
“Oh, I’ll be fine,” I replied, smiling up at him. “You know me.”
He released my shoulders. “I know I’d beat the living tar out of anyone who ever hurt you. Anyway, just always be aware of your surroundings and make sure you never run out of gas again.”
I shuddered, remembering that freaky night. “I guarantee that will never happen again.” 
He chuckled. “I bet.”
A year ago, I’d run out of gas around ten o’clock at night, on a deserted freeway.  I’d forgotten my cell phone at home, and had ended up walking to the nearest gas station. The road had been dark and spooky, and I’d almost felt like someone had been watching me from the woods. By the time I’d gotten to the station, I’d just called my dad to come and pick me up, too terrified to walk back alone with a canister of gasoline.
“Richard,” said my mother, staring at her watch. “We should get going. I told Jody we’d be there in an hour and… that was over an hour ago.”
“Fine. Can we pick up some tacos along the way?” he asked. “I haven’t eaten since noon.” 
“There’s no time. I can always order a pizza or something when we get there.” She turned to me. “Chelsey, have fun tonight, and don’t worry about your cousin.”
“Okay.”
“Maybe I should go with Chelsey and Susan,” said my dad. “Check out the movie theater. Make sure Melody isn’t hiding out there?”
She pushed him toward the door. “Would you just stop, already?” she said, shaking her head. “You’re coming with me.”
He looked at me over his shoulder and smirked. “I had to try.”
“I know.”
“Maybe you should try harder at being more sympathetic to my sister,” said mom.
 He closed the door before I could hear his response, which I knew would probably make her laugh. I was one of the very few and fortunate who had parents that bickered, but lovingly and forgivingly. I couldn’t say that about many of my friends’ parents or even Aunt Jody. She’d been divorced for ten years after being cheated on, and hadn’t had much luck dating. From what my mom said, her ex-husband had been reckless and out-of-control. He liked to drink, party, and live on the edge, and, obviously, his daughter was hell bent on following in his footsteps.    

 
Chapter Three

Chelsey

After they left, I went upstairs and slipped into a pair of blue jeans, with a thin, cream-colored V-neck sweater. It was near the end of October and the nights were getting frosty. I didn’t mind, though, I loved winter and couldn’t wait for the first big snowfall to hit. My parents owned snowmobiles, and there was nothing better than whipping across freshly powdered fields at night, with the stars twinkling above your helmet. It was such a blast that I’d already decided school wasn’t going to deter me from going out this year. Even if I had to stay up both Friday and Saturday nights, cramming and studying, I’d make time for our Sunday snowmobile excursions. I wouldn’t miss them for anything.
 I took out my ponytail, and straightened it with a flat iron. When I was finished, my hair hung just past my shoulders and looked almost as silky as the models did in those hair commercials. Nodding in approval, I grabbed a tube of mascara just as my cell phone rang.
“Hi,” said Susan. “You almost ready?”
“Yeah. What movie should we see?” I asked, holding the phone against my shoulder as I applied the ebony color to my eyelashes.
“I was thinking about that new superhero one. That guy is so hot.”
“The blonde guy with the hammer?” I asked, thinking that he could definitely get my mind off of Melody.
“Hell yeah.”
I laughed. “What time is the movie showing?”
“Seven-twenty. You don’t mind driving over here, do you? My brakes are acting up. I’m going to bring it in tomorrow morning before work and see what’s wrong.”
Susan was my age and used to live across the street. She’d moved to Shore Lake in the eleventh grade, which was about twenty miles from Beaver Creek, but we’d remained good friends. “That’s fine,” I answered, making a mental note to check my gas situation.
“Cool.” She sighed. “I’m just so glad someone switched with me tonight. I really didn’t feel like working three late shifts in a row.”
Susan was a waitress at Ruth’s Diner. I’d only been there a handful of times, but the food was great and the portions were monstrous. Needless to say, they were always busy. “Hmm… I wonder if I should try and get a job there,” I said. “I could really use the money. Maybe even a couple of hours a week?”
“I could talk to Rosie,” she replied. “I’m sure she’d hire you.”
“Wait, didn’t she just hire that girl, Nikki, recently?” I asked, biting off a hangnail. “I suppose she’s not looking for anyone else, if that’s the case.”
“She was hired during the summer, but I’m telling you, we could still use the help. She’s always short-staffed.”
“That would be really cool. I’d only need a few hours a week and… we’d get to see each other more.”
“Exactly.”
 So, what’s Nikki like?” I asked. “She nice?”
“Very, and her brother, Nathan, he’s kind of a spaz, but adorable.”
I raised my eyebrows. “I didn’t know you had a thing for her brother.” 
“Actually, I forgot to mention it, but we went out a couple of times during the summer. It didn’t really go anywhere. He works so many hours at that marina across the street. Anyway, I heard he’s been hanging out with that girl, Celeste.”
An image of a redhead with perfect skin, a perfect smile, and a perfect body flashed through my head. From what Susan had told me last year, she was also a perfect bitch. “Isn’t her dad the town’s sheriff?”
“Yes. You know, he and Celeste are both kind of weird. She’s actually friends with those guys who used to come in at night and just stare at the other customers, creeping them out. Remember I told you about them? The guys who Amy had said were vampires.”
 I chuckled. “Vampires?”
“Don’t laugh,” she said, sounding serious. “Amy’s ex, Ethan, was part of that group. God, he freaked the hell out of me. I’m just happy he hasn’t been coming around lately.” 
“I still can’t believe that Amy killed herself.”
“Well, you know how I feel about all of that,” she replied. 
I did. Amy Kreger had supposedly committed suicide, but Susan, on the other hand, thought that Ethan had something to do with it. “I know. Let’s hope you’re wrong, and that she really did just kill herself. Didn’t you go out with one of Ethan’s friends?”
“Yeah, Drake. The guy from Australia.” She sighed. “I still don’t know what happened to him. He just kind of vanished, too.”
“Hmm… he didn’t call you or anything?”
“Nope.”
I’d never met Drake, but had heard about what a hottie he’d been. 
“Oh, and get this… before Ethan disappeared, he started hitting on Nikki.”
“Seriously?”
“Yeah.”
“What did she do?”
“Well, Nikki was seeing this other guy, Duncan, and I think she blew off Ethan. They’re not together anymore though, either.”
“Nikki and Duncan?”
“Right. She told me that they weren’t even on speaking terms. You know, now that I think about it, their breakup may have had something to do with Ethan.” She paused. “Damn, I want to ask her, but I don’t want to look too nosy.”
I snorted. “Susan, admit it, you are nosy and it’s going to kill you if you don’t find out.”
She laughed.
“Just ask her. If she doesn’t want to tell you, she won’t,” I answered, walking down the hallway towards my bedroom.
“True. God, it’s like one big soap opera.”
“Speaking of soap operas,” I said. “My cousin Melody is missing.”
“What?!” 
I reached into my dresser drawer and pulled out a new pair of white socks. “Yeah, I guess she went to Club Nightshade last night to see some band play.”
“Ah… Venom. I’d heard they were playing last night.”
“Venom?” I’d never even heard of the band.
“They’re from Europe, and are really getting popular. That gal who owns Club Nightshade must have spent a fortune to get those guys to play in Shore Lake. I’ll bet the tickets were outrageous.”
“Huh,” I replied, pulling my socks on. “Well, that’s who Melody went to go see last night. Nobody has heard from her since.”
“Wow. Hey, I heard the main singer, Slade, is a total hunk. I’ve heard him on the radio. If he’s as sexy as that voice of his, I wouldn’t doubt if every girl in town was trying to get in to see him last night.”
“That’s not good,” I replied. “I’m sure a popular band like Venom would attract some real weirdoes.” I sighed. “Great, now I’m worried about Melody.”
“She’s really missing?”
“Well, she never came home last night. I guess I don’t really know.”
“Maybe she’s been partying or something. You told me before that Melody likes to drink.”
“Yeah. That’s what I hope is happening. My aunt is freaking out, though. She says that Melody hasn’t returned her texts or phone calls.”
“Is that normal?”
“She usually returns her texts, I guess.”
“Crap, that’s not a good sign.”
“I know.”
“Hey, do you want to go to the club and find out if anyone knows anything? I’d like to check the place out anyway. I still haven’t been there.”
I raised my eyebrows. “How would we even get in to that place? Tuesdays are Teen-Nights, right? It’s Friday.”
“You forget - I have a fake I.D.”
I grunted. “You know, I think everyone has one of those but me.”
“Eh… it’s not like I use it very much. Curt Hammer made it for me last summer, after he forgot his credit card at home and couldn’t pay for his meal.”
“So, you have a fake I.D. How am I supposed to get in?”
She sucked in her breath. “I know… I know… you can use Katie’s! I still have hers because she’s been too damn chicken to use it. Hold on, I have it in my nightstand, somewhere,” she said. “I talked Curt into making one for her, too. Yep, here it is. Wow, seriously, now that I look at the picture, I just know you could pass for her. No problem.”
Katie was a girl that Susan had graduated with last year, one I’d never met. I bit my lower lip. “I don’t know if this is such a good idea.”
She groaned. “Come on, it’ll be fun. We don’t even have to drink anything; we’ll just ask questions. See if anyone remembers her. You’re the one who’s going to school to become a Private Investigator, right?”
“A Forensic Investigator.”
“Whatever. You know what I mean. Come on, Chelsey, let’s do it! The movie can wait.”
I had to admit, it was an intriguing idea. “Well, maybe we can just stop in for a little while.”
“Yes!” she said. “Like I said, I’ve been meaning to check the place out, but couldn’t find anyone to go with me.”
“Great, now I know the real reason you suggested it.”
“Chelsey! It’s not just that. I want to make sure Melody is okay, too,” she protested. “You know me.”
“I know,” I replied, although I also knew that she and Melody had never really gotten along. But Susan was my friend and had a good heart.
“Oh, I have to find something else to wear. I don’t want to look like a slob. I’m sure there will be some totally hot guys in that place.”
“I’m not dressing up,” I said, looking down at my jeans and sweater. “Just so you know.”
“That’s fine. You know what… I’m not dressing up either. Screw it.”
“What time should I pick you up?”
“Seven. I’m sure there will be a line to get in.”
“Okay,” I said. “I’ll see you then.”
“Cool. I can’t wait to check that place out. Who knows, maybe Melody will be back there.”
“Maybe,” I said, although there was a knot in my stomach telling me otherwise.
 

Chapter Four

Chelsey

When I pulled up to Susan’s house and she got into the passenger side of my car, I smiled wryly. “Not dressing up, huh?”
Tossing her light brown hair, she grinned. “If we’re going to be ‘undercover’, I figured I’d better play the part.”
“We’re not actually ‘undercover’,” I said. “We’re just… investigating.”
She pouted. “Yeah, but it’s more fun pretending that we’re ‘undercover’.”
“Well, I guess in a way we are ‘under-cover’,” I replied in amusement. “I mean we’ll be using fake I.D.s.”
“Which reminds me...” She unzipped her black purse. “Here,” she said, handing me a Montana state driver’s license. “This is you.”
I looked at the picture and my eyes widened. “This says I’m five foot eight.”
She bit her lower lip. “You didn’t happen to wear heels, did you?”
“Even with heels I’m not even close. Dang it.” I tapped my forehead against the steering wheel a couple of times. “Susan,” I said, turning to her. “I hope to God we don’t get arrested for this. My parents would kill me!”
“Relax; they’re not even going to look at your height or weight. All they care about is the year on the license.”
“Let’s hope so.” I looked at the girl in the photo again. I had to admit, she did look similar to me. Sighing, I slipped the I.D. into the front pocket of my jeans. “I just hope they don’t quiz me or anything.”
“You worry too much. Trust me, they won’t.”
I pulled out of her driveway. “Famous last words.”
Giggling, she flipped down the visor and applied lip gloss.  She rubbed her lips together and then flipped the visor back up. “You’re so paranoid.” 
“You should be, too. We’re breaking the law, and obviously, if we get caught, we’re screwed.” 
“Nah,” she said, slipping the tube of lip gloss back into her purse. “We won’t. Nothing interesting ever happens to me. The highlight of my day is counting my tips after I’m done working.”
“I wouldn’t call going to jail interesting.”
“You know what I mean. There is nothing exciting about my life. At least, not at the moment. My job is boring, my clothes are boring, and my love life is also freaken’ boring.”
It was like déjà vu. I’d pretty much told my mother the same thing earlier.
“Your clothes aren’t boring,” I replied, glancing at her sparkly silver sweater and black skirt. 
She smirked. “Yeah, it’s because I borrowed the outfit from my forty-year-old mother. How lame is that?”
I laughed. “Well, your mom has great taste in clothes.”
“She’s single. Single women usually do.”
“You’re single, what’s your excuse?” I teased.
She slugged me playfully. “Bitch.”
“I’m just giving you crap. I’m wearing jeans and a plain old sweater. It’s not exactly exciting either.”
“You’re pretty, though,” she replied. “You could wear anything and the guys wouldn’t notice because of those eyes.”
“My eyes?”
“Yeah. You’ve got cat-eyes.”
“Really?” I asked, glancing at them in the rearview mirror. 
“I’ve told you a million times, your eyes are wicked.”
“Thanks,” I replied. “Although I have to admit, ever since Billy Santino said that my eyes freaked him out in the fourth grade, I’ve been kind of self-conscious about them.”
She snorted. “Please…Billy Santino had a crush on you since the first grade. Your eyes didn’t freak him out, girlfriend. He just had it bad for you. Always did.”
I had to stop my jaw from dropping. Billy had actually turned out to be pretty hot. Well, annoying as all hell, but definitely drool-worthy. “What? How do you know that?”
“Because he told me. Told me he’d always wanted to ‘tap Chelsey’s ass’.”
“Tap my ass?” I burst out laughing. “You’re kidding me?”
“I know… what a pig, huh?”
“I’d say, but seriously, I had no idea he was interested in me.”
“That’s because he thought you hated him,” she replied. “I talked to him at the diner about a year ago and he told me that you used to glare at him all the time in the halls at your school.”
I snorted. “I’m sure I did, because of the comment he’d made about my eyes!”
She laughed.
“Anyway, I would have never gone out with him. Heck, he cheated on Sandy Mayer during the last two years of high school, when they were dating.”  
“Did he really? Well, if I remember she was a royal bitch. She probably deserved it.”
“Nobody deserves it,” I said, although Sandy had been a real snob and we’d never actually gotten along. 
Maybe it was because she knew her boyfriend wanted to tap my ass, I thought, stifling a giggle. 
“They were made for each other,” she said. “They’ll probably get married, have babies, and he’ll cheat on her with bathroom whores at Teddy’s, when he’s supposed to be working late.”
Teddy’s was a seedy strip joint, just outside of Beaver Creek, and known for having broken up a lot of marriages. Rumor had it that many of the strippers would do anything for a twenty, and the place was always packed.
“Yeah, I’ll bet you’re right there,” I replied, pushing Billy out of my mind. I turned on the radio and scrolled through the stations until I found a new song by Maroon Five that I really liked.
Susan reached over, turned it up louder, and began singing with Adam Levine. “He’s so hot,” she said, as the song ended. “I need to buy one of his CDs.”
“Yeah, I love his voice. Uh, here we are,” I said, pulling into the parking lot of the nightclub. I’d driven by it a couple of times on my way to Susan’s, but hadn’t given the place much thought until the last few hours. Now that the mirrored building was lit up with strobe and fluorescent lighting, it was pretty impressive, especially for such a small town in the middle of Montana.  “Looks pretty… swanky.”
Susan fluffed her hair as we parked. “I heard this place gets nuts after midnight.”
I turned off the engine. “Since it’s one of the only clubs around, that doesn’t surprise me.” 
She unbuckled her seatbelt and grabbed her purse. “You ready?”
“I guess so.” I looked at the building again and a knot formed in the pit of my stomach. “You sure we won’t get caught?”
She opened the car door and got out. “Just act confident and you’ll be fine. Come on.”
I slid out of the car and locked the doors. “Okay,” I replied, trying not to chicken-out. She’d obviously done something like this before at other bars, so she knew what she was doing.
Clutching my purse tightly, we walked to the front door and found that there wasn’t a line yet.
“Slow night?” asked Susan, handing the bouncer her I.D. 
“It’s early,” he replied, looking at the fraudulent card.
“True. I know it gets pretty crazy here at night.”
He didn’t reply. 
I stared at him nervously as he looked over her fake I.D. His nametag read “Honi”, and he was bald with a spider web tattoo that wrapped around his neck, and had muscles the size of coconuts on each arm. When he looked up, his dark eyes went directly to mine. 
I smiled innocently.
“You’re next, Cupcake,” he said, handing Susan back her I.D. 
Cupcake?
I cleared my throat and handed him the I.D, our fingers brushing. His skin was unnaturally cool, even for October and the brief contact gave me the chills.
He smiled, a big, toothy grin. “You nervous?” he asked, his eyes glittering in the darkness.
“No,” I answered, trying to look confident, although I was almost peeing my pants. 
He glanced down at the I.D. and then back at me. “Your I.D. doesn’t do you justice, Cupcake.” He smiled and handed me back the I.D. “You’re much better looking in person.”
“Uh, thanks,” I replied, my face turning two shades of pink. 
“You two, behave,” he said. “Or we’ll have to get the whips out, and you don’t want that.”
My eyes widened. “Whips?”
He chuckled and looked at Susan. “She always this gullible?”
Susan smirked. “Only after dark.”
His face became serious. “That’s when you have to be the most careful,” he said. “Especially in this place. Pomaika`i, ladies.”
My eyes widened. “What does that mean?”  
“Good luck.”
His words made the hair stand up on the back of my neck. “Oh.”  
“Uh, thanks,” replied Susan, grabbing my arm and pulling me away.     
I glanced over my shoulder and noticed that he was still watching us. 

Chapter Five 
Chelsey

“That was weird,” said Susan, handing the coat-check girl her jacket. 
“I know. But at least he didn’t say anything about the I.D.s,” I whispered.
She slung her purse over her shoulder. “Exactly. Told you everything would be cool.”
I looked down the hallway leading to the dance area. It was dark and the music was so loud, it made my teeth vibrate. “You ready?” I asked, feeling anxious now that we were inside of the club.  
“Yeah. Should we get a drink?”
“I’m just drinking soda,” I said, wanting to keep a clear head. I’d had a half-can of beer once, and even that had made me dizzy.   
“Suit yourself,” she said. “But I’m having a Cosmopolitan. I’ve always wanted to try one.”
“What is that?”
“It’s a martini.”
“Oh.”
She looped her arm through mine and walked me toward the bar. “We’re undercover, remember? We need to play the part.”
“I can still do that without booze,” I said. “Not everyone drinks alcohol here, I’m sure.”
“Fine, I’ll just tell everyone you’re my sober-cab.”
“Great idea.”
When we entered the main part of the club, I froze in my tracks, amazed at how big the place actually was. Not only did it have two floors, but on the first level, there was an expansive oval bar already crowded with customers, and a dance floor nearby that rivaled my old high school gymnasium. Next to the dance floor was a stage with music equipment from Venom still set up.
“Look.” I pointed at the stage. “I wonder if they’re playing again?”
“The club would have charged us an arm-and-a-leg to get in,” she replied. “Venom doesn’t play for free.”
“I suppose. Too bad. We might have gotten information from them. About Melody.”
“Chances are we wouldn’t have been able to get close to the band, even if they had been playing tonight. I’m sure their security is tight.”
“Yeah, I’m sure you’re right.”
A new hip-hop song began to play. “Come on,” hollered Susan as the volume increased. “Let’s get a drink.”
I followed her to the bar, still paranoid that we were going to get caught and land in jail. 
“Well, hello there,” said a hot bartender with light brown hair, green eyes, and a lazy smile. “Looks like we have some fresh blood here this evening. Excellent. So, what’s it going to be, lovely ladies?”
Susan smiled. “I’ll have a Cosmopolitan.”
“Great choice,” he turned to me. “And what about you? Same?”
I shook my head and ordered a diet soda.
“Sure you don’t want to add a little rum for fun?” he asked, leaning forward with a twinkle in his eyes. 
“No, that’s okay.”
“Suit yourself,” he replied, and then began mixing Susan’s drink.
“So, Brian,” said Susan, staring at his nametag. “I heard Venom was playing last night. Did they put on a good show?”
“It was phenomenal,” he said, shaking her martini in a silver decanter. “Too bad you missed it.”
“Why is their equipment still here?” I asked, nodding towards the stage. “Are they going to play again?”
A guy standing next to me wearing a long, black, leather jacket, turned around. He had dark hair and eyes so blue, they looked like tinted contacts. “Sorry to interrupt,” he said. “They are actually playing a song tonight. Just one.” 
“Really?” I asked, perking up. 
“Yep,” replied the stranger. “It’s the club owner’s birthday and he’s going to sing ‘Happy Birthday’ to her.”
“That’s awesome,” I replied, handing Brian a twenty-dollar bill. “Does she know?”
“No,” he smirked. “So, keep it hush-hush or, I’ll have to kill you.”
Susan snorted. “Really, Ethan? You seriously think that old line is funny?”
My head whipped around. “You know him?” I mouthed.
“Susan, humor is not one of my strong-points, which is why I never attempt it.”
Brian burst out laughing. “Leave it to Ethan to try and freak out the ladies. Don’t listen to him, he loves messing with young girls.”
“So, I’ve heard,” replied Susan, taking a sip of her drink. She licked her lips and set the glass back on the bar.  “I’d also heard that you left town, Ethan.”
He took a sip from what appeared to be a ‘Bloody Mary’. “Is that right. From who?”
“Nikki.”
His face softened. “Nikki... So, is she still working at the diner?”
Susan pushed her hair behind her ears. “I think you already know the answer to that.”
“You’re right. I do. Maybe I should pay her a visit,” he replied, tossing back the rest of his drink. 
I hated tomato juice and watching him slam it down made me shudder.
“So, tell me… do you know where she is right now?” he asked, licking all of the red juice from his celery stick.
“I don’t know. She might be working,” replied Susan, watching him closely. “Enjoy your drink much?”
He dropped the celery back into the glass and then shoved it toward Brian. “More than you know. Brian, I’m taking off. Tell Faye I’ll be back later if she asks.”
“She’s gonna be pissed when she finds out that you flew the coop on her birthday,” replied Brian.
He smiled cockily. “She could never stay mad at me.”
“Famous last words,” he replied. 
Ethan smirked. “I’m seriously not worried.”
“Right,” said Brian.
“Excuse me… Ethan? Uh, when is Slade supposed to sing?” I asked, as he turned to leave.
He turned around to face us again. “About ten minutes from now. Remember what I said - don’t tell anyone. It’s a surprise.”
“I won’t tell,” I replied.
He stared at me for a minute and then reached into his pocket. “Here,” he said, writing something on the back of a card. “Bring this free pass upstairs to the V.I.P. room after he’s done. You can meet the band.”
“Seriously?” squealed Susan.
He winked. “Seriously.”
“So, is this like a bribe?” I asked.
 “Yeah, I guess it is. Plus,” he grinned wickedly. “Something tells me that Slade will thank me later.”
“Ethan,” said Susan, who I noticed was finished with her Cosmopolitan. “You know, I have to say… I was wrong about you. You’re a really, really nice guy.”
“Well, thank you, Susan. Brian, why don’t you get them both another drink while they wait for the show to start. On me.”
“You bet. You sure you don’t want something stronger than that?” asked Brian, pointing at my untouched soda.
“No, this is fine,” I answered, picking up the glass and drinking through the little straw.
“Come here, you big lug,” said Susan, opening up her arms. She was obviously feeling no pain after that stiff drink. “Give me a hug.”
I knew it had to have been my imagination, but it almost looked like his eyes were glowing an eerie orange color when she threw her arms around his neck, and gave him a friendly hug. 
Must be the lights in the club, I thought.
He stiffened up and stepped back. “Gotta go. Have fun, girls. Enjoy yourselves, and Susan, party like a rock star tonight.” He nodded toward me. “Your friend…ah…”
“Chelsey,” I offered.
He grinned. “Chelsey, is obviously your sober-ride tonight. Take advantage of it.”
She put her arm around my shoulders. “I believe I will. Hey, say ‘hi’ to Nikki for me.”
“Will do. Have fun tonight, girls,” he replied, walking away.
Susan removed her arm from my shoulders as Brian set another cocktail onto the bar. “I don’t know about you, but Ethan could use a little more vitamin E in his life.”
“What do you mean?” I asked.
“Come on…. the guy is paler than my mom’s pit bull,” she said, taking a sip of her second Cosmopolitan. “Pugsley.”
“At least he doesn’t smell like Pugsley,” I replied.
“Actually, he smells like candy,” she replied. “Always. It’s kind of a weird smell for a guy, but yummy all the same.”
I agreed.

 
 
  Chapter Six
Slade

“Let’s move as soon as this song is over,” I said to my drummer, Liam, as we stepped out of the dressing room in the back of the club and headed toward the stage. 
“I think we should stay one more night here,” he replied. “Relax and have a few beers. Head out in the morning and sleep the entire day while on the road.”
“You just want to snuggle up to the club owner,” said Jimmy, who played bass. 
Liam smirked. “Can you blame me? The woman is sexier than hell. I wouldn’t mind getting a piece of that before the night’s over.”
Sean, our keyboardist, snorted. “God, you’re such a dog.”
Liam grinned. “I won’t deny that.”
“I’d stay away from Faye,” I said, smiling at two girls who were staring at us with open mouths. 
“Oh, my God, that’s Venom!” shrieked the shorter one, fanning herself quickly. “Oh, my God… oh, my God!”
“I love you, Slade!” yelled the other one, throwing me kisses. 
I waved and kept walking.
“Why not?” asked Liam. “You want her for yourself, bro?”
“Not at all,” I said, grimacing at that notion. Even though I had to admit that she was a beautiful woman, Faye was also very dangerous. I could see it in her eyes. “She’s just not the kind of woman who has a one-night stand without expecting something more.”
“Hell, I’ll give her more the next time I’m in town,” he laughed.
I grinned. “Căcănar”.
“What’s that?” he asked.
“I think he just called you an ‘ass’,” replied Bradan, our other guitarist. 
“At least I get ass,” said Liam. “Slade is too good for most of our fans.”
“Sorry, but I’m not interested in using our fans for sex. It’s not my thing, and you should really refrain from doing it, too,” I answered. 
He snorted. “Hey, I’m doing both of us a favor. They get to go back and brag that they slept with a member of the band, and I get to relieve some of my pent-up… anxieties, by putting a smile on their pretty little faces. Nothing wrong with that.”
“Nothing, if you’re human,” I replied quietly. “But every time you have sex with one of those girls, you risk losing control.”
“I have more control than all of you combined,” he said as we entered the main part of the club. “They’re much safer with me than with you. Remember, I’m not like you cretins.”
He was right about that. Liam was a Lycan, while the rest of us in the band were all vampires. 

Chapter Seven
Chelsey 


Less than ten minutes later, there was a sudden burst of commotion in the center of the club. 
Susan sucked in her breath and smiled. “Oh, my God, there they are!”
I turned toward the stage as the band, Venom, emerged from the crowd and stepped onto it. 
“Wow,” I replied, feeling a little breathless myself. I couldn’t see much, but I had to admit that it was a little exciting to know that they were actually there and going to sing. 
“Let’s go,” said Susan, grabbing my arm.
“Where?”
She looked at me like I was clueless. “Hello?! By the stage.”
“Are you kidding? We’ll never get close,” I said, pointing. There were already dozens of people fighting to get closer and more appearing from other parts of the club. To me it wasn’t worth the fight. “No way. Susan, people are going to get trampled and I, for one, am not going to be one of them.”
Her shoulders slumped. “You’re right. There’s no way we’ll get near them. Jesus, would you look at all of the people there already? It’s insane. Where in the hell did they come from?”
“Some of them were in the basement,” said Brian, pouring pink shots for a couple of girls who didn’t look much older than us. From the way they were embracing and kissing each other, they were obviously more than just friends. 
Embarrassed, I quickly looked away.
“The basement?” said Susan. “What’s down there?”
“Private parties,” he said with a sly smile. “I’ve never been to the basement, personally, but I’ve heard things are pretty intense down there.” He wiggled his eyebrows. “If you know what I mean.”
I didn’t know what he meant and wasn’t sure if I wanted to ever find out. “Let me get this straight, you’ve been here for a while and you’ve never been down there?” 
“It’s very elite. Even for the employees that work here. I guess you could say that most of us haven’t ever seen the basement. You need a special invite from Faye, even if you work here.”
“That’s really bizarre,” I replied, shaking my head. It made me wonder if my cousin had somehow ended up down there.
The lights dimmed even lower in the club, and I watched as a tall, dark-haired guy began to speak into the microphone on stage.
“Good evening, everyone,” he said. “Sorry to interrupt your partying -”
“We love you, Slade!” screamed one of the lesbians standing next to us. Then, both she and her girlfriend lifted their tops and flashed the band.
My jaw dropped.
“Classy,” mumbled Susan.
“Wow, well, thanks,” replied Slade, still staring toward us. “You’re making me blush.”
The two girls giggled and lowered their tops.
Slade began talking again. “The real star here tonight is that very lovely lady who invited us to come and play at her club. Now… a little birdy told me that it was a special occasion, and we just knew that we couldn’t leave Montana without wishing her a wonderful birthday. Everyone, give it up for Faye Dunbar!”
The crowd began to clap as one of the glass windows opened up in the balcony, where a group of people sat, drinking champagne and watching the stage. 
“Stand up, Faye!” hollered someone in the crowd.
An elegantly dressed woman sitting in the balcony stood up and waved. 
“Happy Birthday, Faye!” hollered a group of people in the back. 
“Thank you!” she answered, beaming down at everyone. 
“Faye, Birthday Girl, this song is for you,” said Slade as the band began to play the familiar jingle.
Slade put the microphone closer to his mouth and began to sing. His voice had a rich, deep timbre and it gave me goosebumps. I suddenly wished that I could get a closer look at him, but from the distance we were at, I could barely make out Slade’s face.  
“God is he gorgeous,” said Susan, stirring her drink. 
“I wish I could see him better,” I pouted, squinting my eyes.
“You still need glasses, don’t you?” 
“Probably. They’re not that bad, though. It’s just the lighting in here.”
“Right… You know, maybe I should drive home tonight?” she said, smirking. “I’d like to wake up tomorrow in someplace other than the coroner’s office.”
“Whatever. My eyes aren’t that bad. Seriously.”
“If you say so…”
I turned back toward the stage. “Is he really that cute?”
“Hell yes. Look, don’t worry,” she replied. “You’ll see him soon enough. V.I.P., remember?”
“Exactly.”
“Just don’t forget why we came,” she said, winking at me.
“What do you mean?”
“I mean a guy like that could make you forget to go home, if you know what I mean,” she replied.
My eyebrows shot up. “What? Are you saying that you think Melody may have really gotten together with Slade?”
“I don’t know. It’s possible when you look like Melody. She could get any guy in town, why not a hot, single musician?”
“He’s single?”  
“From what I hear. Although, it wouldn’t matter. Not these days. Rock stars like that always have girls hitting on them. I’m sure Slade sleeps with a new fan every night.”
I agreed.

 
Chapter Eight
SLADE

When we were finished with the song and getting ready to leave the stage, I stole another glance toward the bar. For some reason, I couldn’t stop staring at the little redhead in the cashmere sweater. I wasn’t sure if it was the fact that she looked so innocent and out of place at the club, or that her bluish-green eyes completely captivated me. Regardless, I was intrigued by a human and it had caught me off guard completely.
“Nice, huh?” said Liam, nodding toward the bar.
“Uh, yeah. She’s definitely a looker.”
His eyebrow arched. “I was talking about the girls making out over there. The ones who flashed us their goodies. Who in the hell are you talking about?”
“Nobody,” I replied as the club’s security accompanied us off of the stage. The crowd had grown considerably and were now screaming and yelling for us to play more songs.
“Should we do another one?” asked Jimmy, looking around. “I mean, I feel like we owe the fans, you know?”
I stopped in my tracks and turned around. “Fine. Just one.”
“Let’s do that new one you wrote,” said Liam. “See how they like it.”   
“Yeah, Dark Dreams,” agreed Jimmy.
“Okay,” I replied, thinking that one more song would give me a little longer to process what I was feeling about the girl at the bar.
When we made it back onto the stage, the crown erupted in approval.
“Thank you,” I said, after turning the microphone back on. “You guys in Shore Lake really rock.” When they noise finally died down I grinned. “So… we can’t leave without one more song, we just can’t.”
The crowd hooted and clapped.
The band began to play the chords to a song that was very personal, one called “Dark Dreams”. Closing my eyes, I thought of the woman who’d inspired me to write it and joined them when it was time. I sang of losing everything to a girl, one who’d bewitched and haunted my dreams after tearing my heart apart. I sang of regret, heartache, and the torture of moving forward. It was a song I’d written well over one-hundred years ago, after falling for a human girl. 
Vanessa. 
Our passion had been like no other and I would have given my life for hers, in a heartbeat, but in the end, it was me who’d actually destroyed her. Vanessa had not been able live with the fact that she’d loved a vampire. A monster. When she killed herself, she’d also killed a part of me. From that day forward, I stayed away from humans and only associated with other immortals when I needed sex. Although I’d managed to make it work, it was still a very hollow existence.  
When the song ended, the crowd erupted in applause. Forcing a smile, I glanced toward the bar again, but noticed the girl with the red hair was gone. Then something caught my eye, and I looked near the other side of the stage, and there she was, right below it, grinning up at me.
Good God she was even more beautiful when she smiled….
When I grinned back, she lowered her lashes and blushed. It was then that my senses went into overdrive. I could tell from the look in her eyes and the way that she was breathing that her body had released endorphins in response to my performance. I’d excited the hell out of this human girl, and based on her obvious innocence, she probably didn’t even realize it.
A fire ignited in my stomach and my jeans grew tighter. In horror, I turned around and stared at Liam’s ugly mug, hoping it would be enough to kill my arousal. But, her face was all I could see in the back of my mind. Her delicate face, staring up at me with hunger.
Shit.
I’d never gotten excited onstage, and it had been years since I’d even allowed myself to think about a human girl in such a way.  Now I had a raging boner. 
“You okay?” asked Sean.
I didn’t answer. I was far from okay. 
“Dude, what’s up besides…” laughed Liam, nodding towards my zipper.
“Give me your guitar,” I said to Jimmy, gritting my teeth.
Grinning, he handed it over to me. 
I held it in front of my jeans and turned back to the audience. 
“Thank you, everyone!” I hollered, waving my hand and trying to avoid the human who’d gotten me so worked up. “Have a great night!” Then I walked off the back of the stage while security rushed to keep the fans from mauling me.
 

Chapter Nine
Chelsey
  
“Wow, that was awesome,” said Susan as we walked back over to the bar. “I still can’t believe that you wanted to fight our way over to the stage. I definitely wasn’t expecting that one.”
“Neither was I,” I replied, still shocked myself. But, after he’d started to sing, something had come over me. Like a moth to a flame, I’d been drawn to Slade’s voice, wanting to get as near to it as I could. He’d swept me away with the lyrics, and the emotion in his words had touched me deeply. I could see why he had so many fans, especially female ones.     
“Did you see the way he stared at you?” remarked Susan. “The guy looked like he wanted to jump your bones!”
My eyebrows shot up. “What?”
“He was hot for you. Even his eyes looked like they were on fire.” Her forehead wrinkled. “Actually, it was kind of weird how they glowed. I’m sure it was some kind of stage act with contact lenses or whatever.”
“Yeah,” I replied, having noticed the same thing. Ethan’s eyes had glowed the same way, and again, I blamed it on the lighting.
“Anyway, now I bet you can’t wait to meet him.” She smirked. “Hell, I bet he can’t wait to meet you. I mean, wow… the way he looked at you. I thought he was going to leap off of the stage, throw you over his shoulder, and carry you to his man-cave.”
My stomach grew warm with that idea. “Shut up. He did not.”
“He was definitely lusting after you. You should be thrilled.”
“Slade wasn’t lusting after me,” I said, trying not to smile. I had to admit, the idea was making me tingle.  
She giggled. “You’re such a virgin.”
“How do you know?”
“Because you’d have told me all the gritty details by now.”
I blushed.
She pointed. “And you wouldn’t be blushing.”
“Whatever,” I said as we stopped back by the bar.
“Hey,” said Brian, handing Susan her martini. “You forgot this. I saved it for you.”
“Thanks,” she replied, winking at him.
“We should go up to the V.I.P. now,” I said. “Before it gets too late. I really don’t want to stay here too long. I have a lot of studying to do tomorrow.”  
“Sure, but let me finish this first,” she said, stirring the martini. 
“I take it those Cosmopolitans are pretty strong,” I said, noticing how shiny her eyes were getting.
Susan grinned. “They are but they go down smooth.” She held out the glass. “Try some? Just a sip?”
Not wanting her totally wasted by the time we met the band, I extended my hand. “Sure, I’ll help you.”
She handed the glass to me. “They are so… yummy,” she said. Susan lowered her voice and gave me a lopsided grin. “Kind of like the bartender.”
Chuckling, I gulped down most of the drink and then shivered. It was really strong. 
“Hey,” she pouted as I handed her the glass. “You hardly left me any.”
“Sorry,” I replied, feeling my stomach get warm. I smiled as the heat spread to my cheeks. “I see what you mean. Those are damn good.”
“Would either of you like another one?” asked Brian, handing an older guy next to us a bottle of beer.
“No,” I said, grabbing my purse from the bar. “I think we’re going upstairs.”
“But, we’ll be back,” said Susan, smiling at him flirtatiously. 
“Hey,” I asked leaning toward Brian. “Just curious… you mentioned that you were working last night?”
“Sure was. In fact, I’m here most nights until close.”
Feeling more comfortable with him, especially now that the booze had loosened my tongue, I lowered my voice. “Did you see a blonde around my age here last night? About as tall as Susan with long hair and big blue eyes?”
“Yeah and even bigger boobs,” said Susan.  
Brian burst out laughing. “Sounds like half the girls who were here last night.”
And tonight, I thought, looking around again. 
“What’s her name?” he asked, wiping the top of the black-marbled bar with a towel. “Maybe it will ring a bell.”
“Melody Williams,” I said. 
His forehead wrinkled. “Hmm… Melody…. blonde hair and stacked, huh? Can’t say that I recognize the name, but that doesn’t mean she wasn’t here. Last night was jam-packed.”
“Oh, she was definitely here,” I replied. “Her friends, Veronica and Taylor, verified that.”
He swung the towel over his shoulder and gave me a curious look. “So, why exactly are you looking for this chick?” 
“She’s my cousin and now she’s missing. She supposedly took off with some guy last night and hasn’t made it home yet.”
Brian shrugged. “Maybe she’s still with the dude and just forgot about checking in.”
Susan grinned wickedly. “Exactly. Maybe she’s just too busy gettin’ busy to think about anyone else right now.”
He chuckled. “Exactly. Once they come up for air, you’ll hear from her, I’ll bet.”
“I hope so,” I replied, still not too sure myself. No phone calls from Melody, well that was one thing, but the texting thing disturbed me. She was addicted to her keypad and should have texted somebody by now.
Just then, my own cell phone began to vibrate. I pulled it out of my purse. “It’s my mom,” I said to Susan, staring down at the text. I sighed. “They still haven’t heard from Melody.”
“Crap,” said Susan. “I was hoping that you were getting some good news.”
“Me too. She says she’s staying with my aunt overnight,” I said as I began typing a message back, telling her that I was still out with Susan and would be home later.
“Is your dad staying, too?” she asked. “Or is he going to start badgering the police to start looking for her?”
I shoved my phone back into my purse and zipped it up. “I’m sure they’re going to file a Missing Person’s Report. It’s been almost twenty-four hours since Melody’s friends saw her.” 
She bit her lower lip. “I know what Brian said and all,” she said as we stepped away from the bar. “But what if something seriously bad has happened to her?”
“That’s why we’re here,” I said. “To see if anyone remembers seeing her, or the guy she left with. Melody kind of stands out in the crowd, you know? I would think that someone would remember her.”
“She definitely thrives on attention. So, um… are you going to ask the band if they know anything?”
“Well, I’m going to try,” I replied as we took the stairs. “I mean I didn’t exactly come here to ‘ooh’ and ‘ah” over these guys. I’m here for answers.” 
“Ditto. Hey, maybe we should have asked Ethan? I didn’t even think about that.”
“I did, but not until after he left. Unfortunately, it’s too late now.”
“Shit,” she said, looking back toward the entrance. “We should have asked the coat-check girl. I didn’t even think about that!”
“If it’s even the same one from last night.”
“Doesn’t hurt to ask.”
“We’ll, do it on the way out.”
“Good thinking. Hopefully Slade will remember something about her, too. I’m sure Melody made her way to the front of the stage to get his attention.”
“It wouldn’t surprise me,” I replied, picturing her making goo-goo eyes at him. After seeing and listening to him tonight, however, I couldn’t exactly blame her.
When we reached the top, there were three rooms marked “V.I.P.” We stepped toward the one with two security guards.
“Yeah, um… I think we’re supposed to give you this,” I said, holding up the card from Ethan. 
The taller of the two, Bill, a guy with a blond ponytail and goatee, took the card. “You say Ethan gave you this?”
I nodded.
“Yeah,” said Susan, her eyes big. “Don’t worry, we’re not going to stay long. Just want to meet the band and maybe get an autograph or two.”
The other security guard, Mason, a dark-skinned man with soft brown eyes and a friendlier face, leaned over and looked at the card. He read it and then smiled at us.  “Huh… well, I guess it’s your lucky night.”
“It appears that way,” I replied, as Bill handed me back the card.
“Or maybe not,” said Bill under his breath with a smirk.
“What was that?” I asked, looking up at him. With his thick lips and beady eyes, he was far from attractive.
Mason laughed. “Don’t listen to him. He’s just jealous.”
“Screw that,” said Bill. “I’m not jealous of those guys. I get all the chicks I want. I don’t need to be in a rock band for that.”
“Whatever. I’ll escort you two inside,” said Mason, turning back to us. “There might be some crazy shit going on in the V.I.P.” He smiled wickedly. “And you lovely ladies might just need some protection from the animals in there.”  
I looked at Susan nervously, wondering what we’d gotten ourselves into. There were a lot of rumors about the club. Creepy ones. 
Mason looked at my face and burst out laughing. “Hey, I’m just messing with you. You look like you’re about ready to take off running.” 
I forced a smile. “No. I’m fine. I knew that you were joking.”
He tilted his head. “You still look a little apprehensive. Don’t be. Nothing bad will happen to you,” he grinned wickedly, “unless you want it.”
I glanced at Susan, who was also smiling.
“Come on,” he said, stepping back so we could enter the lounge. “I’ll introduce you to Venom. I have a feeling they’re going to be happy when you two walk through the door.”
“Really?” asked Susan.
 “Hell yeah. They love meeting their fans.”
“We’re kind of new fans,” I said, hoping that nobody would ask me about the music or which song was my favorite. 
“That’s even better,” said Mason, walking us down the hallway. “The band just loves fresh meat.”
I sighed. “Great.”

Chapter Ten 
Chelsey


When we stepped into the lounge, I had to admit, it was very classy. 
“Wow, now this is what I call a night club,” said Susan, beaming. “I just can’t believe it’s hidden away in a small town like Shore Lake. The owner must have spent a small fortune on this place.”
“Only the best for Faye. She wouldn’t have it any other way,” said Mason.    
I thought the club below was impressive, but it was dull compared to the décor in this room.
Obviously, I thought, looking around, if this was where they catered to the rich and famous, then it would have to be pretty extravagant. 
“Swanky, huh?” asked Susan, elbowing me.
“Yeah, it’s nice,” I replied, raising my voice as another song began to play in the club.  
The lounge was extravagant and obviously catered to a higher-class customer. The room itself was dimly lit with a purplish hue. Curved leather sofas and black marbled tables lined the sides of the room, most of them already filled with hipsters, drinking and talking loudly over the music. In the back was a large crystal bar with two bartenders serving top-shelf liquor while scantily dressed servers, dressed in purple and black uniforms, walked around with plates of appetizers and drinks. 
  “This way,” said Mason, leading us toward an area that overlooked the dance floor below. As we drew closer I recognized the group playing cards around a table that looked like it had been sculpted out of amethyst. As we approached, the guys looked up from their game, eyeing us curiously. Everyone in the band appeared to be there, except Slade. 
“Mason, what’s up?” asked a guy, who I recognized as the drummer. He had shoulder-length blond hair and twinkling blue eyes. 
“Ethan sent them up. Fans of yours,” he replied and then turned to us. “I’m going to hand you off to these fellows now. Have fun, ladies.”
“Uh, thanks,” I replied, feeling totally sober and awkward now that we were standing in front of the band. 
“Sounds good to me,” replied another guy at the table. He had brown eyes and dimples so deep that I couldn’t help but return his smile.
“I’m Liam,” said the blonde guy, who reminded me a lot of Thor, which I knew Susan must have found thrilling. “So… you girls into poker?”
“I’ve played before,” replied Susan, grinning stupidly at him. Obviously, my observation had been dead on.
Liam, who towered over both of us, stood up and pulled over a couple of purple leather club chairs. “Here, sit down and we’ll deal you in. We aren’t playing for money or anything.”
“That’s because you still owe me from last weekend,” said the guy with the dimples. “Cheap-ass.”
“I don’t owe you shit,” replied Liam. “You’re dreaming.”
“If I was dreaming, you’d have paid me,” he replied as Susan and I sat down.
“Keep dreaming and maybe you’ll get your money,” chuckled Liam, taking a swig of his beer. “
Dimples laughed. “You’re such a dickhead.” 
Liam ignored him and turned back to us. “So, don’t be shy. What are your names?”
“I’m Susan and that’s Chelsey,” she said, smiling nervously. Obviously she was a little star-struck. I myself was pleasantly surprised that these guys were so easy going.
“What about you?” I asked, trying to relax.  
“We’re the guys your momma warned you about,” said Liam.
We all laughed this time.
“Seriously, though,” I said. “What are your names?”
“Thought you were fans,” said Liam, shuffling the cards. He grinned. “Or are you just ‘Slade’ fans?”
“No. Actually, although we do enjoy your music, we came up here for something totally different,” I replied.
“To play poker?” joked Liam, staring at me with amusement. “Please tell me your favorite is ‘Strip’. I always pay up for that.”
“No,” I replied, blushing. “Actually, we wanted to find out if any of you have seen my cousin. She’s missing.”
There was a long silence and then the guy with the dimples leaned forward. “Missing? When did she go missing?”
“Last night. I guess she came here to see your band in concert and then left with a guy. Nobody has seen or heard from her since.”
“And you find that odd?” laughed Liam.
“Exactly. She’s probably just pulling an all-nighter,” said another guy. He had short red hair and a goatee. Like the others, he was also very handsome. “I’m Sean, by the way. That’s Jimmy,” he pointed to the dimpled guy. “And that’s Bradan,” he said, nodding to a fourth guy who was texting someone on his cell phone. 
Bradan looked up and smiled. “Sorry, lass, I’m listening to you. Truly I am. Keep going.”
I licked my lips. “Well, like I said, she’s missing, but I don’t think she’s pulling an ‘all-nighter’. She hasn’t contacted anyone, not even her friends, and Melody can’t live without texting.”
Bradan held up his phone. “Like I said, sorry about this. I’m not normally this bad. It’s me ma. She won’t stop asking me to come home for the holidays.” 
I smiled at his accent. “So, are you the only one from Ireland?”
“We all are,” said Liam, although he didn’t have an accent. “Except for Slade. He’s originally from Romania. He lost his accent eons ago.”
I laughed. “So, I take it you’ve been in the U.S. for a while then?”
“Yes,” said Jimmy with a glint in his eye. “Centuries, in fact. Interesting place.”
“Wow, you sure age well,” teased Susan. “Let me guess… you’re really vampires and drink blood to stay young and virile?”
The table went quiet.
“Ha ha…” said Susan, shaking her head. 
“Ah… you Americans and your infatuation with vampires,” chuckled Liam. “It’s quite amusing.”
“Almost as amusing as our infatuation with zombies,” replied Susan. “Last week there was a ‘Zombie Bar Crawl’ in town.” She grimaced. “They all showed up at Ruth’s afterwards - drunk, hungry, and… creepy. I know they do it for fun, but zombies just freak me out, you know?”
I agreed. 
“What is a ‘Zombie Bar Crawl’?” asked Liam.
“People dress up as zombies and basically bar-hop all night long,” she replied. “They’ll do it again on Halloween.”
“That actually sounds like a lot of fun,” said Jimmy. “Hell, we could join them and have a regular night without obsessed fans. I wouldn’t mind getting all gored up for that.”
“I agree,” said Liam. “Don’t get me wrong… I’m grateful we’re getting more popular, but it definitely has its drawbacks.”
“I’m sure you’ve lost a lot of privacy,” I replied.
He nodded. “You have no idea.” 
“So, um, where is Slade?” asked Susan. 
 Liam looked over my head. “What do you know? Ask and you shall receive.”
When I turned around and saw Slade this close, my mouth went dry. He had to have been the hottest guy I’d ever seen. Dark hair, broad shoulders, a strong jaw, and eyes as green as the grass after a rainfall. 
“What’s going on?” he asked, staring down at us, his face dark and brooding. 
“Fans,” replied Liam. “Ethan sent them up.” 
Slade stopped next to me and I lowered my trembling hands to my lap. Although he was clearly irritated that we’d joined the table, I felt like there was a static connection between us. 
“Is that right?” he smirked. “You two are fans of Venom?”
“Uh, yeah,” I replied, smiling up at him weakly.
His eyes darted down to my chest and then back up to my lips, so quickly that I’d almost missed it. 
“Don’t mind Slade,” said Liam. “He doesn’t like to mingle with fans the way we do. Not usually. Tonight might be an exception, though.” He winked at me and then looked back up at Slade. “Is this the one from earlier?”
Slade ignored him and continued staring, to the point of making me uncomfortable. 
Liam laughed. “That’s what I thought. I think you actually got under his skin tonight, honey. That’s a miracle in itself.”
“Liam,” said Slade, his voice even. “Why don’t you go find yourself a jar of peanut butter and a girl to occupy yourself for the rest of the evening?”
The other band members laughed, but I was confused about the peanut butter.
“Do you like peanut butter, sweetheart?” asked Liam with a gleam in his eyes as he turned to Susan.
“Doesn’t everybody?” she asked, smiling, but also looking confused.
Slade laughed and then I felt his eyes upon me again. Although I was secretly thrilled that he was checking me out, it was also very irritating. I wasn’t naïve and knew that he’d probably already pegged me as an easy lay.
“So, you two are fans but neither of you were at the show last night,” he said softly.
Stunned, I looked back up at him. “And how do you know that?”
His smile was dazzling and made my stomach quiver. “I just do.”
“He just does,” mimicked Liam. “Slade thinks he knows everything, but the truth is, he’s just full of shit.”
“And that’s coming from someone who talks circles around people, just to confuse the hell out of them,” countered Slade, piercing him with a hard stare. 
“It isn’t hard,” said Liam. He smiled. “And I cannot tell a lie, it amuses the hell out of me.”
“You mean the look of being pissed off?” chuckled Sean.
“That too,” replied Liam, raising his beer. 
Slade pulled up another chair and sat down next to me. Our knees touched briefly and I flinched.
“Sorry,” he said, moving his leg closer.
“It’s okay,” I replied in a light, breathy voice. Yes, there was definitely a charge emanating from his body and it was making it difficult for me to breathe.   
“What’s your name?” he asked. His sultry eyes were hypnotic and beautiful. I almost wanted to take a picture of them with my phone, just so that I wouldn’t forget what they looked like up close. 
“Chelsey,” I replied and then quickly moved back so he could see Susan. “And that’s Susan.”
“Hello,” she said, waving with another silly grin.
“Hi.” His eyes moved back to me and I reminded myself to breathe normally. I was here to find Melody and not pant over Slade, no matter how hot he was. I wasn’t a star-struck groupie who would fall at his feet like most of the girls did off-stage. I was someone who needed his help and not his approval. “So, what brings you to the club this evening? Obviously, you’re not a regular.”
“How do you know that?” I asked, wondering if we stood out that much. I had to admit, I felt a little over-dressed compared to the slinky outfits most of the girls wore. I looked like I was going out for pizza, not clubbing.
“She’s here because she’s looking for her cousin, who’s missing,” said Liam, still watching us with an amused expression. 
Slade’s face became serious. “Really? Missing? 
“Yeah. Since last night,” I said. “Nobody has seen or heard from her since.”
Just then, Faye Dunbar walked into the lounge and the table became quiet.
“Great,” whispered Susan, dryly.
Faye Dunbar, who I figured had to be somewhere in her twenties, was the richest, as well as the coldest woman in Shore Lake. I’d never met her personally, but Susan had mentioned several bad run-ins she’d had with her at the diner. 
“Faye,” said Liam, standing up. “You are a gorgeous woman, you know that?”
Even I had to admit that she was very attractive. Tonight, she wore a cream colored dress that hugged her perfect figure, and diamond earrings that cost more than my parents’ new SUV. 
“Oh, Liam,” she said, smiling up at him. She pushed his chest playfully. “You’re such a flirt, but don’t ever, ever change.” 
He grinned. “You make a man like me want to change, sexy. Just say the words and I’ll leave my entire harem for you.”
“I’d tire you out, Liam,” she teased back. “Just ask my harem.”
He laughed. “That’s rich, I like that. So, can you stay and have a drink with us?”
“I’m sorry, but I can’t. I do need to speak to Slade, though,” she said, turning her eyes toward him. “Can you spare a few minutes of your time?”
“Sure.”
Faye’s gaze shifted to me and I felt a shiver go up my spine. There was no warmth in those eyes, and I knew instantly that the woman didn’t like me. 
“Do I know you?” she asked, staring at me like I was an uninvited guest in her home.
“Uh, no,” I replied, trying to smile. “I don’t think so.”
She wrinkled her nose as if smelling something foul and then her eyes moved over to Susan. “You work over at Ruth’s, don’t you?”
“Yes,” replied Susan nervously.
I watched as Faye reached up and patted the side of her long, blond hair. It was so shiny and sleek that I couldn’t help but feel a twinge of envy. She kind of reminded me of a famous actress from one of my mother’s old black-and-white movies. With her style and perfect features, I just knew I could never look as glamorous as this woman. I began to wonder if there was something going on between her and Slade, and if that was the reason she was acting so frosty. 
Faye titled her head to the side and smirked. “Funny, I didn’t think you were of age to be here tonight, Susan.”
Susan’s smile didn’t falter and I had to give her credit. “Of course I am.”
“Good, because I would be very angry if I had minors sneaking into my club,” she replied stiffly. “It would be bad for business and even worse for the person doing it.”
Susan’s face went white. “I have an I.D.”
“Good for you,” replied Faye, smiling coldly. “Don’t lose it.”
Slade stood up quickly. “So, you said you needed to talk, Faye?” 
She turned, her eyes raking over the white graphic T-shirt, emphasizing his narrow waist and broad shoulders. Obviously, he still found time to work out between gigs and she noticed it as well. I normally wasn’t into muscles, but damn… everything about Slade was sexy. “Yes. Is now a good time, Slade?” she asked, turning into the friendly club owner again.
“For you, Birthday Girl, I have as many moments as you need,” he replied, holding out his forearm.
She linked her arm through his and beamed up at him. “My, I guess it’s true what they say about you.”
“What’s that?” he asked with a slight grin. 
“That you’re as smooth as that voice of yours,” she replied. 
“Smooth as shit,” muttered Liam under his breath with a sneer.
“Boys, I’ll return Slade after I’m finished with him,” said Faye over her shoulder as they began to walk away. “Oh,” she turned around. “If anyone runs into Ethan, let him know that I’m looking for him.”
“Did you try calling him?” asked Sean.
“He doesn’t carry a cell phone,” she replied, frowning. “Refuses to own one, actually.”
“Why?” asked Bradan. “I couldn’t live without mine.”
“If he doesn’t get one soon, he may not live without one either,” she replied, looking serious.
The guys laughed but from her expression, she was clearly angry. Ethan was obviously in for an argument when he ran into her again. I wondered if they were seeing each other or somehow related.
“Let’s go chat, shall we?” she said to Slade.
“Lead the way.”
I watched as they stepped towards the exit and felt another wave of envy. Not only was she everything I wasn’t, but it was obvious that she had the sexiest guy in the club wrapped around her finger.  
Jimmy cleared his throat. “So, Chelsey, tell us again about your cousin.”
I told him everything I knew. After I finished, they asked if I had a picture of her.
I took out my phone and scrolled through photos I’d taken. When I came to a picture of Melody at her graduation party, I handed Liam the phone.
He bit his lip and nodded. “Yeah, actually, we did see her. Last night.”
My eyes widened. “Seriously? You did?”
“Sure did,” he replied.
“Let me see,” said Bradan, holding out his hand.
Liam handed him my phone and Jimmy also glanced at it.
“Oh yeah,” said Jimmy. “I remember that chick.” He chuckled. “Who wouldn’t?”
Bradan laughed and handed me back the phone. “I’m sure she’s fine. She was in good hands last night. Nothing to worry about.”
I raised my eyebrows. “Really? With whom?”
He picked up his beer and took a swig. “Slade.”   
 

 Chapter Eleven
Slade


“Who were your friends?” asked Faye as we stepped out of the V.I.P. lounge.
 “Just a couple of fans,” I replied quickly. I was still stunned that Chelsey had been at our table when I’d stepped out of the bathroom. Then, when I’d sat down next to her and inhaled her human scent, it had almost been too much to handle. I was attracted to everything about her, which was unsettling for me and potentially lethal for her. 
Faye raised an eyebrow. “Just a fan… well, she obviously thinks you’re the cat’s meow.”
I played it off. “Of course she does. All of my female fans do.”
“Yes, I’m sure they do,” she agreed, chuckling.
I wondered what Faye wanted with me. Not many people made me nervous, especially a woman, but there were rumors about this one that were disturbing, even for me. Rumors that included pleasure, pain, and unimaginable horror for those who crossed her. If she hadn’t agreed to pay such a high price for our band to perform at the club, I would have never gotten within ten feet of her. The only reason we were still in Shore Lake was to sing her the Birthday song, which she’d also set up and paid for. 
“In there,” she said, waving a hand toward her private office. 
“Okay,” I replied, a little relieved she wasn’t taking me into the basement. Liam had been told that there were some freaky things going on down there, including BDSM and orgies. I wasn’t into either and had no interest in seeing it live and in person.  
“Close the door,” she replied, walking around her white and black marbled desk. 
I obeyed and then sat across from her in a black leather chair.
She took out a pack of cigarettes from the top drawer of her desk. “Your performance last night was incredible,” she said, lighting the end of one. 
“Thank you,” I replied, leaning back in the chair as she blew out a stream of smoke. “I thought we played pretty well myself.”
She rested her chin on her hand and smiled. “So, tell me, Slade, what do you think of Shore Lake?”
I shrugged. “It’s very… wildernessy.”
She nodded. “Yes. Well, you get used to it. I’m originally from Vegas.”
It wasn’t a secret. “Oh, is that right?” I asked, feigning surprise. 
She took another drag of her smoke and blew out a ring. “”Yes that is right. I have a feeling you already knew that, however.”
I grinned sheepishly. “Not a very good poker-face?”
“Not this time, but something tells me that you could lie through your teeth and most wouldn’t be the wiser.”
“You’ve got me all figured out, huh?” I asked, not liking how this conversation was going. She obviously wanted something more from me. Something more than just a song. 
“Slade, dear, I know what you are,” she said in a low, amused voice.
I tapped my fingers against the arms of the chair. “Is that right? You know what I am?”
“Oh, yes… definitely. It’s why I brought you here.”
I grinned. “I’m lost… could you enlighten me as to what you’re talking about?”
“You’re a Roamer.”
I chuckled. “A Roamer? What in the hell is that?”
She leaned forward. “In Romania, I believe you go by ‘Vampire’. Some of the vampires here, however, prefer the term ‘Roamer’.”
I grunted. “You’re kidding, right?”
She blew out another stream of smoke. “I’m dead serious, Slade.”
I leaned back in my chair. “What am I supposed to say to all of this? I mean, a vampire? Really? You believe in that shit?”
She looked amused. “Come on now. Just admit it.”
“There’s nothing to admit,” I replied evenly. “I’m a singer in a band. Nothing more and nothing less.” 
“Fine,” she said, standing up. “If you’re not going to do it freely, then I’m going to have to play dirty, which I rather enjoy anyway.”
I rubbed my forehead and sighed. “Faye, you’re wasting both of our times. We need to get on the road soon.”
She walked over to a door on the other side of the office and opened it. “Bring in the girl.”
A security guard with long, brown hair stepped out of the other room holding the arm of a disheveled-looking young woman. One that I recognized from the night before. Today, she looked like she’d just rolled out of bed and hadn’t showered or changed her clothing. 
“Hi, Slade,” she said, staring over at me with pleasure. 
Frowning, I stood up. “What’s happening here?” 
 “Don’t you remember her?” asked Faye, now standing next to the blonde. She put her arm around the girl’s shoulder and smiled darkly. “She certainly remembers you.”
For the life of me, I had no idea what Faye was trying to pull. The girl didn’t mean anything to me other than she was another fan who had tried to catch my eye.
“Slade?” said the girl in a breathless voice. “Where have you been? I waited for you all morning and afternoon, but you never returned to the room.”  
I stared at her in shock. “Excuse me?”
Her face fell. “You seriously don’t remember last night? The after-party… and then the hotel?”
What I remembered was seeing her in the club, dancing in front of the stage, but that was it. I had gone to the after-party for only a short time, but then I’d left and gone to my hotel room. Alone. 
“Oh, for Pete’s sake,” snapped Faye. She grabbed the girl’s hair, baring her neck. 
“Ouch!” she hollered, trying to get out of Faye’s grasp. “Let me go!”
My mouth went dry as I stared at the vein in her soft, fragile neck. I imagined my tongue licking the salty flesh right before I buried my teeth into her supple skin. It was then that I realized I hadn’t fed for a few days and it was now catching up with me. “Faye,” I growled in a raspy voice. “Enough.”
With her long, red nail, she traced along the girl’s neck, enticing me further. “Lovely, isn’t it? I bet you’d love to sink your teeth into this little morsel.”
“Screw this shit,” I snarled, heading towards the doorway. “I’m outta here.”
“Are you sure about that?” asked Faye.
The girl screeched in protest and the scent of her succulent blood filled the air, awakening the beast inside. Unable to resist my own damning urges, I soon found myself straddling the human on the carpet as she stared up at me with terror.
“Slade?” she whispered, her lip trembling as I stared down at her, my own body quivering with need.
“Go on,” urged Faye.
Panting, I battled against the hunger burning inside of me, but with every breath, I felt my resistance weakening. It had been decades since I’d tasted anything this sweet and fresh. Normally, my meals were collected from plasma centers, which quelled my hunger to a point, but it still wasn’t nearly as glorifying as warm blood. Nothing was. 
“Feed. Do it,” demanded Faye, kneeling down next to us. “Rip her throat out and take what’s yours.” She gently ran a hand over the girl’s hair, smoothing it away from her face. “You do want to please Slade, don’t you Princess?”
The girl swallowed hard and nodded.
I looked at Faye, who I could tell was only doing this for some kind of twisted pleasure. Her evil malice gave me the strength that I needed to resist
“Enough,” I growled, releasing my hold on the girl. I stood up and offered her my hand.
“What in the hell are you doing?” snapped Faye, looking furious.   
I pulled the girl to her feet and glared at Faye. “The real question is, what are you doing and why?”  
Ignoring the question, she turned to her security guard. “Lucas, take the girl out of here. Bring her downstairs and give her to the Roamers.”
I pulled the girl back, away from Faye and Lucas. “You’ve already done enough to her. I’m getting her out of here.” 
“Oh, what a gallant gesture,” sneered Faye. “You do realize that she knows too much now, don’t you?”
“She doesn’t have to remember anything,” I answered. “I can make her forget all of this.”
Faye stared at me and I could see the wheels turning in her head. I wasn’t sure why she’d wanted me to confess something she’d already known. “What exactly do you want from me?” I asked, positioning the terrified girl behind me. “Because you’re really pissing me off, Faye.”
Her face softened. “You know, I believe that we started this conversation on the wrong foot.”
I waited for her to go on.
She licked her lips and smiled. “I want you to fire your manager, move to Shore Lake, and let me take care of your career from this day forward.”
I grunted. “You’ve got to be kidding.”
“Not at all. As you already know, I’m a very wealthy and successful woman. I have connections all over the world with people who can take your career to an entirely new level of success. Slade, I can make you rich beyond your wildest dreams.”
“I’m already rich.” I’d accumulated a lot over the last three hundred years and our band did well. Money wasn’t even a motivator for me. Never had been. I only performed and sang, because it made me feel almost human. 
“Maybe, but you haven’t reached superstardom yet, Slade.” Her eyes glittered. “I can help you get there.”
“Thanks, but no thanks. We don’t need you.”
She smirked. “Is that right? Well, the rest of your band has already agreed to this. They want me to be your new financial advisor and manager.”
I stared at her in disbelief. “What? Bullshit.”
She went back around to her desk and turned on the laptop. “They even picked out a cabin already. Slade, moving here is the best decision for everyone. Vampires do need to stick together.”
“Are you saying that you’re a vampire?”  
She snorted. “Hell no. I’m a Shifter.”
Fuck, now that was bad news. Shapeshifters were dangerous, and most of them were known to have violent tempers when they didn’t get their way. Something told me that things were about to get uglier.
“It would never work. We don’t like to stay in one spot too long,” I replied. “I’d suffocate here.”
“You wouldn’t have to live here permanently,” she replied. “Hell, the Roamers have already proven to me that they are unable to settle anywhere for too long. But, when we move, you’d move. Eight months tops in Shore Lake and then we’ll move on to the next town. Together.”
I folded my arms across my chest. There was no way in hell I’d live near this psychotic bitch. “What do you get from all of this, besides more money and fame?”
“To be honest, I like to be in control. You’re relatively new to the U.S. and obviously don’t understand how things are done here.”
“What exactly does that mean?”  
Her face darkened. “Fine, I’ll tell you the truth - I run this part of the country. Me. Nothing happens without my knowledge or approval. There are those immortals who would challenge my authority and like more than anything to take away all of the power I’ve acquired. Of course, they always fail because I have an army to back me up. An army of your kind.”
“Then why do you need us if you’re so damn powerful?”
She smiled. “Let’s just say that I like you, Slade. I want you on the team.”
What she really wants is to control me and the band, I thought. Along with anyone else that poses a threat. There was no way I’d let that happen. “I need to speak to the band about this. Quite frankly, it would be inconvenient for us to settle here. Really inconvenient.”
Her eyes gleamed a purplish hue. “It would also be dangerous if you didn’t. Really dangerous.”
“I don’t take intimidation well,” I replied sternly. I’d survived a century in Romania, where vampires were hunted and crucified by both humans and other immortals. I’d been beaten and tortured by more than the likes of Faye Dunbar and there was no way that I’d allow her to push me around. 
“Then I suggest that you don’t do anything that will provoke any further threats,” she replied icily.
“You don’t frighten me,” I said. “So if I were you, I’d forget all about me and the other members of Venom. There is no way in hell that we are going to take orders from you.”
“You’re making a big mistake,” she said, standing up.
“Doubtful. I think we’re done here,” I said, preparing to leave. 
“Oh, you’re done, all right. Lucas, take the girl,” she ordered.
I turned to face Lucas. “Keep your hands to yourself, Roamer.”
Lucas hesitated for a moment, but then took a step toward us. 
“Stand down,” I hissed, baring my fangs. “Or you’ll all regret it.”
“Slade, seriously, reconsider what we’ve talked about,” said Faye. “You’re risking the lives of your entire band if you cross me, you know.”
“You’d better stop with the threats, Faye,” I said, backing away with the girl. “Before it’s too late.”
“Dammit, your defiance is infuriating!” she snapped, pushing a button on the side of her desk. 
The door in the back swung open again, and this time, three men dressed in club uniforms entered the office. 
“Escort Slade and this human to the basement,” said Faye. “And make sure they don’t escape.”
They nodded and advanced toward me. 
Swearing, I met them halfway.

 

Chapter Twelve 

Chelsey


“What?” I asked in shock.
“Now that pisses me off,” said Liam, frowning. “He was just giving me a hard time about screwing…” his eyes darted to me. “I mean partying with fans.”
“Well, he left the party with her last night. I believe they were heading to the hotel for a little something… something…,” said Jimmy, smirking.
“But she never came home after something… something…” I snapped, angry that I’d been so attracted to a player like Slade. What did I expect, though, he was in a band and drop-dead gorgeous. He wasn’t a normal guy that one dated or developed real feelings for. He was just a one-night stand that would never amount to even a phone-call afterwards. “So, he needs to help us find her.”
“Oh, he will,” said Liam, still scowling. “I’ll make sure of that.”
“You know, I’m a little surprised he left with her,” said Sean. “It’s not like him. Seriously.”
“That chick was really hot, though,” stated Jimmy, throwing his cards down. “I’m out.”
“Yeah, but he’s turned down hotter,” said Bradan. He looked at me. “No offense.”
“None taken,” I replied.
Susan stood up. “I think we should find him right now and ask what he did with her.”
“I think we know,” chuckled Jimmy.
She rolled her eyes. “You know what I mean.”
“I agree,” I said, not wanting to wait any longer. I just wanted to get out of the club and go home. I stood up. “Let’s go talk to your boy.”
“Faye might get mad if we interrupt their so-called meeting,” said Bradan. He shook his head. “That guy is getting all kinds of action this week.”
Liam, who appeared to be still sulking, stood up. “I agree with the girls, we need to find Melody, now. Plus, something doesn’t feel right, here. I can’t quite put my finger on it, but I’m feeling a little anxious. Let’s go interrupt them.”
The others stood up and we walked out of the lounge.
“Did you see where Faye Dunbar and Slade went?” Sean asked Mason, who was still standing just outside of the lounge, guarding the doorway.
He shook his head. “No, I’m sorry I didn’t see them.”
“They just walked out of here less than five minutes ago,” said Liam, who towered over Mason.
He shrugged. “Sorry, man, I don’t know where they are.” 
“If you see Slade, let him know we’re looking for him,” replied Sean.
“Hold on a second.” Liam cocked his head and then swore. “It’s Slade. He’s in trouble.”
“How do you know?” I asked, staring at him in shock. He hadn’t even pulled out a cell phone to check for messages.
“Let’s just say that he has exceptionally good hearing,” said Bradan.
“We gotta move,” said Liam, who turned and took off down the hallway. The others followed, running so fast that they seemed to have disappeared into thin air.
Mason muttered something under his breath and pulled out his phone.
I turned to Susan. “Did you see that?”
Her face was pale. “I don’t know. I think that drink I had earlier is making me crazy. They kind of like…vanished, didn’t they?”
“It almost seemed that way,” I replied, still stunned.
“Uh, what do we do?” asked Susan.
“Let’s go find them,” I said, pulling her arm.

 
Chapter Thirteen

Slade


“You done!?” snarled Lucas, who’d just slammed his fist into my face for the third time.
“Fuck you!” I growled, spitting out blood. Two of the Roamers had me pinned to the ground and the third was struggling to hold my legs.
“He’s stubborn, I’ll give him that,” chuckled Faye.
I glared at her. “Glad this amuses you.”
“Would you hold him down better?” complained Lucas as I broke my right arm free and punched one of them in the jaw.
Lucas stood up and kicked me in the ribs several times. 
“Asshole,” I growled. It hurt but my body healed so quickly that when he finished, there was nothing more than a dull ache.
“Slade!” screamed the blonde, who was in the corner, behind a filing cabinet.
“Run,” I ordered, but she just stared at me, frightened.
“Bring him into the basement. Maybe we can change his mind down there,” stated Faye. 
I spit out another wad of blood and it landed on her carpeting. 
She glared at me. “Great. I just had that installed last week, dammit. I’m going to need to replace it again.”
Lucas kicked me in the spleen. “Good going, fool.”
I grunted. “She can bill me.”
Before Faye could respond, her office door was kicked in and pieces of splintered wood flew everywhere.  
I sighed in relief as Liam and my boys entered the office. When they saw what was happening inside, all hell broke loose. Within seconds, I was free and Faye’s guards were being slaughtered.
“Stop!” hollered Faye, now staring in horror at the twist of events. It was obvious that we were much older and stronger; her men were useless in a one-on-one combat.
“You okay?” asked Liam, dropping the lifeless shell of Lucas to the ground. His fur and lycan features began to recede, until he was kneeling next to me, naked.
“I was until I saw you naked,” I joked, spitting out more blood. 
He stood up and waved towards his manhood. “Yeah, it’s a monster. I’d be scared too.”
I shook my head laughed.
 “Oh, my God!” shrieked Chelsey, who was now standing in the doorway with Susan, and staring at the nightmare in the office. The terror on her face wiped the smile from my face. I felt an urge to comfort her, but knew she’d freak out if I made any attempt.
“Shit,” said Liam, covering his junk with his hands. 
I looked behind me. Bradan and Jimmy were just finishing off Faye’s last two minions. Fangs were bared and blood was everywhere. It was like a grisly scene from a horror movie. I could only imagine what the human girls were feeling. This was our world, not theirs.
“Vampires!?” screeched Susan in horror. She tried to turn and run, but behind her stood a dark-skinned security guard, blocking her way. He grabbed her by the arm.
“Forget about her, Mason!” hollered Faye. “Get more security!”
His eyes now a fiery red, Mason released Susan and took off.
“Chelsey!” sobbed the blonde, still hiding behind the filing cabinet.
Chelsey turned and gasped. “Melody!” She ran over and pulled her into her arms. “Are you okay?”
Melody, nodded. “Yes. I think so.”
“You guys, come on!” choked Susan, who was also crying now. “We have to get out of here.”
I sighed. They’d seen too much and I had to do something about it.
“You need to make them forget,” said Liam.
“I know,” I said, walking towards the girls. I gave them a reassuring smile. “Don’t worry, I won’t hurt you.”
“Stay away from us!” hollered Chelsey. “You… you’re all monsters.”
The look in her eyes crushed me. It reminded me of Vanessa. “I’d never hurt you. I swear.”
Chelsey looked behind me and screamed.
I turned around just as some kind of winged reptilian creature lunged at me.
 

Chapter Fourteen

Chelsey



The creature that landed on Slade reminded me of a gargoyle, with its greenish-black scales and rubber-like wings.  It was like something out of a horror movie. I began to wonder if this was all a dream. 
“Oh, my God,” gasped Susan, covering her mouth in horror.
Just when I thought the madness couldn’t get any crazier, Liam turned into a massive wolf and sprang at the reptile trying to attack Slade. 
“Let’s go!” screamed Melody, grabbing my hand and pulling me toward the doorway.
Terrified, I obeyed. We grabbed Susan and then scrambled away from Faye’s office, down the hallway, and back to the main area of the club.
The music was as loud as ever, and everyone seemed oblivious to the horrors taking place on the top floor of Club Nightshade. Frightened beyond belief, we hurried down the staircase, toward the exit when our bartender from earlier stepped directly into our path
Are you girls okay?” he asked, looking concerned.
“Brian…. Oh, my God,” said Susan, shaking her head vehemently. “There are monsters upstairs. We’re leaving. Now.”
His eyebrows shot up. “What?”
“Just like she said,” I answered. “Vampires, werewolves, and gargoyles. We’re so out of here.”
He stared at us in amusement. “Let me guess, too many Cosmopolitans?”
“No,” I snapped. “Look, we’re not making this up. Go look for yourself if you don’t believe us.”
“Calm down,” he said, placing a hand on my shoulder. “You’re going to scare the other customers.”
“They should be,” I answered, as four security guys raced across the bar and headed toward the staircase.
“Let’s just get out of here,” said Susan, watching them go up quickly, “before the monsters start searching for us.”
“I agree,” I said.
As we attempted to walk around Brian, he grabbed my arm. “What’s your hurry? Why don’t you follow me to a quiet place and we can all talk about this?”
“Brian, seriously, you have to call the police,” said Susan. “We’re not drunk and there is some scary shit going on upstairs. No lie.”
He sighed. “Fine. Let’s just find a safe place and we’ll call the police.”
Susan shook her head. “No. You call the police, but we’re out of here. There’s no way in hell that I’m staying in this place any longer.”
His eyes hardened. “No, you’re not going anywhere. Now, follow me.”
“Excuse me?” I snapped, pulling away from him. “You can’t tell us what to do.”
Before he could respond, another security guard approached. “Brian, Faye wants you upstairs. Go, now.”
Without another word, Brian quickly obeyed and took off toward the stairs.
Releasing a ragged sigh, I followed Susan and Melody down the hallway by the entrance until we reached the exit. Once outside, we bolted to my car. Susan sat next to me and Melody got into the back.
“What do we do?” I asked as we locked ourselves inside. 
“I’ll call the police,” said Susan, pulling out her phone.
“Hurry, get us out of here,” begged Melody, hunching down into the back seat. “I just want to go home.”
“I’m so glad you’re safe,” I said as we pulled out of the parking lot. “Everyone’s been worried about you.”
“Me too,” she replied, rubbing a hand over her face. 
“What happened?” I asked, looking back at her in the rearview mirror.
“I’m not so sure anymore,” she said, leaning her head against the back of the seat. She closed her eyes. “I just remember bits and pieces of last night. Watching the band, the party, meeting Slade. I don’t know… I almost feel like I’ve been drugged.”
I frowned. “I wonder if someone slipped something into your drink.” 
“Maybe,” she replied. “Maybe it was Slade. We left the after-party last night. Together.”
“Yes, I’d like to report a… violent crime,” said Susan, into the phone. “At Club Nightshade.”
I grunted. A violent crime? Well, that was even putting it mildly.
She glanced at me and shrugged. 
“Oh, hi Sheriff,” she said, biting her nail. “You want us to come down to the station?” She looked at me.
I nodded.
“Sure. We’re on our way.”
After she hung up, Melody swore. “I can’t see the sheriff. I’m going to get into so much trouble. The cops are going to know that I had a fake I.D.”
“Us too,” I replied. “But I think when they find out what’s happening at the club, they might be a little more lenient.”
She snorted. “Right. Can you just drop me off at home and forget that you saw me there?”
“Melody,” I snapped, staring back at her in disbelief. “We were at the club trying to find you. We probably just saved your life and you’re worried about getting busted because of the I.D.?”
She didn’t say anything.
“People were being murdered right in front of us,” said Susan, turning back to look at her. “Once they start investigating everything, the cops are going to find out that you were there anyway. I’m sorry, but they need to know everything and I’m not lying.”
Melody groaned. “Yeah, I suppose you’re right.”
“I still can’t believe it,” I said, turning past Ruth’s Diner. “The guys from ‘Venom’ are vampires and werewolves? Seriously?”
“I guess so,” said Susan. “We all saw what was happening.”
“Do you honestly think anyone will believe us?” asked Melody.
“They have to,” I replied. “I just wish I would have taken a picture with my phone.”
“There was no time,” said Susan. “I mean, it wasn’t as if we were prepared for any of that.”
There was a loud thud on the roof of the car and we all screamed in shock.
“What was that?!” cried Susan, moving closer to me as she stared out the side of her window. As if someone was going to break it and try grabbing her.
Shaken, I pulled over to the side of the road. “I don’t know. Maybe a bird? I hope…”
“No fucking way,” whispered Susan in horror as the gargoyle from Club Nightshade, leaped from the top of my car to the pavement in front of us. It opened its mouth and let out a monstrous roar.
Terrified, I threw the car in reverse, and punched it. The tires squealed in protest as we raced backwards.
“Watch out! There’s something behind us!” screamed Melody, staring back out the window.
Before I could blink, we slammed into whatever it was and there was a loud thud under the tires.
“OhmyGod!” screeched Melody, as we rolled over whatever it was that we hit.
I slammed my foot on the brake and the car came to a quick halt.
“What did we just hit?” asked Susan, her voice shaky. “What the hell was it?”
Trembling, I looked at her. “Maybe it was that thing. It could have flown around and came at us from the back.”
“Then who cares if we hit it,” said Melody. “We just need to get the hell out of here.”
I caught a movement in the corner of my eye and Melody screamed as Susan’s door was ripped away from its hinges. 
“Susan!” I cried as the winged monster dragged her out of the car, kicking and screaming.
“Help me!” she shrieked, trying to get out of the beast’s grasp.
Crying, I jumped out of the car and raced toward them. “Leave her go, you freak!” I screamed, beating on the gargoyle’s head with my fists. The scales made my skin bleed, but I ignored it, along with the pain, and kept punching.
“Chelsey!” screamed Susan, still frantically trying to get out of the gargoyle’s grasp. “Help me!” 
The monster screeched angrily and then backhanded me. I flew backwards and my head hit the pavement, the pain overwhelming, but all I could think about was saving Susan. I scrambled back up and then cried out in horror as the beast leaped into the sky, carrying her like a rag doll into the darkness.
I closed my eyes and fainted.

Chapter Fifteen

Chelsey


When I finally came to, I was lying in a hospital bed, wearing a hospital gown. Confused, I tried to sit up but the pain in my head took my breath away.
“You’re awake,” said a nurse, peeking her head into the room. She was tall, with short curly red hair, and green glasses.
“Yes,” I replied in a raspy voice.
She walked inside and began examining me. “How do you feel?” she asked, checking my pulse.
“My head hurts. A lot,” I replied, wincing as I moved it.
Her smile was sympathetic. “I’ll get the doctor and I’m sure he’ll order something for the pain.”
“Is my mom here?” I asked. My head was a little fuzzy and I couldn’t exactly remember why I was even in the hospital.
“Uh, no. Let me get the doctor,” she said, walking away. “We’ll return shortly.”
I closed my eyes and tried to remember what happened. After a few seconds, the memory of Susan being carried away by the monster came back to me and my breath caught in my throat.
Was she okay? Had I been dreaming?
Someone knocked on the door as I tried getting out of the bed to search for my phone. 
“Yes?” I answered.
“Hey, sleepyhead,” said a man wearing a white lab coat. 
I slumped back against the pillows. “Hi.”
The nurse walked in behind him and they both approached the bed. 
“How are you feeling, Chelsey?” he asked, looking at a clipboard. 
I sighed. “My head hurts.”
“I’m sure it does,” he replied. “You have quite the lump back there.”
“Can you tell me if there was a girl named Susan Fields who may have either visited me or was admitted here?”
The doctor removed his reading glasses. “No, not that I’m aware of. Is she a friend of yours?”
“Yes. She was with me before I blacked out. Where are my mom and dad? Hasn’t anyone contacted them?”
He sighed. “I’m not sure where they are. We found your home phone number and tried contacting them, but they haven’t returned any of our calls.”
My eyes widened. “How long have I been here?”
“Since last night,” he replied. “I’m rather surprised myself that they haven’t called us back.” 
“You left a message?”
“Of course we have.”
 “What about my cousin, Melody Fairfax? Did she bring me in? Maybe she spoke with them?”
“No, actually a young man brought you here, along with your purse and cell phone.  Then, he pretty much vanished,” said the doctor. He tapped his pen against the metal on the clipboard. “I wish I had more information to give you. But, right now, that’s all I have.”
“You really don’t know who brought me here?” 
“Guess not,” he replied. “Look, Chelsey, the sheriff will be in to see you sometime this evening. He has some questions for you. Maybe he can help you get to the bottom of all this and figure out where your parents are.”
“I hope so,” I replied. “Do you know where my things are? I need my phone.”  
“They’re in here,” said the nurse, opening the closet door. She pulled out my purse and walked it over to me.
“Thanks,” I replied, taking it from her. I unzipped the top, pulled out my cell phone, and then quickly dialed my mom’s cell phone.
“We’ll be back in a minute,” murmured the doctor, his smile reassuring.
“Thanks,” I replied as mom’s phone continued to ring. When she didn’t answer, I left her a message and then dialed my dad.
“Dad, it’s me. I’m in the hospital, the one in Shore Lake, I believe,” I said, staring outside, into the darkness. It was after eight, and I couldn’t imagine why they hadn’t been to the hospital yet. It had been over twenty-four hours since I’d last spoken to them. It made no sense that they hadn’t at least tried to call me. “I can’t get ahold of mom, either, and… I’m scared. Please… call me.””
Next, I tried calling both Melody and Susan, but neither of them answered. Upset, I sent them both texts.
Maybe they were still with Aunt Jody?
I searched for her name in my contact list and dialed her as well, but got the same results. My eyes filled with tears as I tried my mom again.  “Mom, please call me,” I begged. “I need to hear from you.”
As I hung up, there was another knock at the door. 
“Yes,” I said, wiping the wetness from my cheeks. “Come in.”
A man with dark hair poked his head in the door and smiled. “Excuse me? Chelsey Fairfax?”  
“Yes.”
“I’m Caleb Smith, the sheriff here in Shore Lake. Do you have a few minutes?”
“Yes, of course,” I replied, sitting up straighter. “I’m so glad that you’re here. You have no idea…”
He chuckled. “Now that’s not something I hear every day.”
Smiling grimly, I pulled the blanket in tightly. “I’m scared, Sheriff. I don’t know what’s going on, I don’t know where my parents are, and I think my best friend might be dead.”
His eyes widened. “Whoa,” he said, reaching into the pocket of his brown uniform. He pulled out a pen and a small notepad. “Now you’re scaring me. Chelsey, I think we’d better start from the top. Tell me how you ended up with that bruise on your head? What do you remember?”
“Uh, okay. Have you spoken to my parents?”
He sat down in a chair next to me. “I’m trying to locate them. Have they been traveling lately?”
“No,” I said, and then proceeded to tell him about my cousin Melody.
“You say she’s missing?” he asked.
“Well, she was and then I found her. But…now she is again. I think.”
He frowned. “I’m confused.”
Sighing, I started from the very beginning and told him everything. When I got to the part of how we used the fake I.D.s to get into Club Nightshade, his eyes narrowed. “Obviously, you know that’s against the law.”
“I know,” I replied. “And… I realize that it was stupid. Very stupid. But, we did find Melody.” I proceeded to tell him the rest of my story, but when I got to the fight involving the band Venom, he stopped me.
“Chelsey, were you taking any drugs last night? Any hallucinogens?”
I shook my head vehemently. “No,” I replied. “Absolutely not! It was all real, Sheriff, I swear to God. I’m not making any of this up.”
From the expression on his face, he obviously did not believe me. He scratched the side of his cheek. “Hmm… Well, why don’t you just continue?”
I did, but when I got to the part of Susan being swept away by the gargoyle, he smirked. “Come on, Chelsey… you can’t expect me to believe that, now can you? Honestly, a gargoyle?”
“You have to believe me,” I said, gritting my teeth. “It really happened.”
“You’re talking about vampires, Chelsey.”
“Yes, and werewolves!” 
He closed his eyes and rubbed the bridge of his nose. 
“Look, did anyone find my car?” I asked, getting desperate. “The gargoyle ripped the door right off of it. A human couldn’t do that!”
Sheriff Caleb raised his pen again. “We did not find your car. I wasn’t even aware that it was missing,” he replied, jotting on his notepad. “But, we’ll search for it.”
“We were attacked about a quarter of a mile east from Ruth’s Diner,” I said. “It has to be there. Unless, Melody drove off with it. Have you spoken to her?”
“No, I’m sorry.”
My head began to pound even harder. Frustrated, I blinked back more tears. “What is happening? My family is missing and so is my best friend.”
“We’ll find them,” he replied. “I’m sure they’re all fine. Confused, but fine. Hell, maybe they’re out driving around, trying to find you.”
“They thought I was seeing a movie last night.”
“Obviously, they were wrong.” The sheriff stood up. “Let me make some phone calls and see if I can send someone out to your aunt’s place.”
I grabbed a tissue and blew my nose. “Thank you, Sheriff.”
“We’ll keep trying to get ahold of your parents, too,” he said, walking toward the doorway. 
“When can I go home?”  
“I’ll check with the doctor, and if you can leave, I’ll drive you home myself,” he said, putting the notepad in his pocket. “Maybe we’ll run into your parents.”
“I hope so. Thanks.”
He gave me a reassuring smile. “Don’t worry, honey, we’ll reunite you with your parents soon enough. Let me speak to the doctor and we’ll get the ball rolling.”
“Okay.”
After he left, I got out of bed and pulled my clothing out of the closet. I then went into the bathroom, washed my face, and changed back into my sweater and jeans. A few minutes later, there was another knock on the door.
“Yes?” I said.
The door opened and the nurse from earlier appeared. “Here, I brought you something to ease the pain,” she said, holding two white pills and a small cup of water.
“Thanks,” I said, talking them from her.
“You might feel a little sleepy,” she said, staring at me as I swallowed them down. “But at least the pain will subside.”
“What did the doctor say about my head? I forgot to ask.”
“I believe that you just have a slight concussion, nothing too serious. He’ll talk to you before your released.”
“Okay. Does that mean I can leave soon?”
“Yes, the sheriff is talking to the doctor now. I’m sure you’ll be checking out before nine.”
It was almost eight-thirty. “Cool.”
“Let me know if you need anything else.”
“Thanks, nurse,” I squinted to look at her name tag. “Jennifer Gardener.”
“You’re welcome, Chelsey.”
 After she left, I grabbed my cell phone. When I noticed that there was a message from Melody, I sighed in relief. I quickly dialed my voicemail and listened.
“Chelsey, it’s Melody. Listen, you’ve got to get out of the hospital, now! And whatever you do, don’t go anywhere with Sheriff Caleb, he’s one of them, Chelsey. A vampire! I’m serious… don’t say anything to him about what you saw last night, either. If he finds out that you know what took place at Club Nightshade, you’re as good as dead. Now, hurry and meet me in the parking ramp. Fourth floor. I’ll be watching for you.” She began to cry. “They’ve already gotten to our parents, Chels. They’re all dead! Please, hurry and get your ass out to the parking lot!”
Caleb was a vampire?!
Our parents were dead?!
Choking back a sob, I grabbed my purse and rushed to the door. Just when I was about to open it, someone knocked from the other side.
Crap, crap, crap!
Trying to remain calm, I pulled the door open, and stood face-to-face with Sheriff Caleb.
“Oh good,” he said, beaming a bright, white smile at me. “You’re ready. Perfect timing because I’ve been told that you can leave as long as you’re under my protection.” He nodded towards the lobby. “I’ve already signed you out, so we can just go. I take it you’re all set?”
I swallowed hard. “Uh, actually, I’m almost ready, but my stomach hurts. I think I have to go to the bathroom. Can I just meet you in the lobby?”
His smile fell. “Uh, sure. I can wait for you there.”
“Good. I won’t be long, Sheriff. Thanks so much for doing this.”
“No problem. You know,” he looked at his watch. “I need to call my daughter anyway. Tell her I’m running late. I’m supposed to be dropping off a late dinner for her.”
“Good idea.”
After he left, I waited a few minutes and then snuck out of my room and down the hallway. I then followed the signs until I found an exit that led to the parking ramp and then took the stairs. When I reached the fourth floor, my eyes scanned the cars, but I didn’t recognize any of them. I pulled out my cell phone to call Melody, when an old black Firebird with tinted windows turned the corner of the lot and sped toward me, its engine rumbling loudly. I held my breath as the passenger window rolled down and a hand waved at me.
“Melody,” I said, sighing in relief as the car stopped next to me. 
She opened the door quickly, got out, and pulled the seat back. “Hurry, get in before someone sees you.”
When I noticed who was driving, I stared back at her in horror. “What are you doing with him?”
Slade looked up at me from inside of the car. “Get in, Chelsey.”
“No way,” I said, taking a step backwards. “You’re one of them. A vampire.”  
Slade smiled grimly. “Yeah, I’m a vampire, but I’m also your only hope. So, get in if you want to make it out of here alive.”
Melody grabbed my wrist. “He’s right,” she said, her eyes haunted. “We’re both dead without him.”

Prologue


Kelly

I filled up my tank, and could not believe the price of fuel. How was it possible that it had doubled since yesterday? Two vials?
 Two vials had once been enough for me to pay the electricity in my apartment for a month, or a nice pair of shoes. Now, my hard-earned income seemed to go straight to gas or rent, and there was not much leftover for fun.
I shook my head in disgust and closed the gas cap tightly.  As I ran into the station to pay for the fuel, it started to rain.
Behind the counter, a sullen, bored-looking teenager sat paying no attention to me as her fingers quickly worked her cell phone.
I cleared my throat to get her attention.
 She looked up at me. “Pump number?” she asked, annoyed.
“Pump sixteen,” I said, mimicking her tone.
“That'll be two vials puh-lease,” she said, holding out her hand.  
I reached into the cooling pouch inside of my bag and reluctantly handed over the two vials.
She smiled insincerely. “Thank you for shopping at Gas-N-Go.  Have a nice day.”
Ignoring her, I grabbed the receipt from her hand, walked out the door, and then drove the short distance to my apartment building.  
When I arrived, I unlocked the front door, walked in, and set my keys and purse on the counter. It was a decent enough place, but as I looked around, I had to admit that there were days when I really missed my expansive childhood home.
No need to start feeling sorry for yourself, I thought. You’re the one who made the choice to move away from home.
I’d wanted to prove to myself and to my parents that I could do it on my own. So far, I was doing okay, but if things continued and blood became anymore scarce, I wasn’t sure where exactly that would take me.
I sat down on the worn hand-me-down couch, kicked off my heels, and clicked on the television. As usual, the first five minutes of the news was about the latest Eternal death. There had been a recent string of them in the past few weeks, and in each case, the M.O. was the same. Obviously, someone or something didn’t appreciate us being here, and it was starting to worry me.
From what I’d been told, The Eternals had once been a dying breed, even just a few years ago. They’d been in hiding, and were only able to hunt for food at night. Then, a new leader had risen to power amongst them with a plan. A plan that would once and for all ensure the existence of their kind. Little had his race known what kind of cataclysmic chain of events he’d trigger by setting it into place.

 
Chapter One

Rani

“Rani!” my Mom called. “Come on, you’re going to miss the bus!”
I took the stairs, two at time, kissed my mother quickly on the cheek, and ran to the bus stop just as the bus was pulling up. When I sat down, I could barely catch my breath.  
“Jesus, Rani,” snorted my best friend, Tyler. “If you would wake up five minutes earlier, you wouldn't have to run at such a breakneck speed just to make the bus, you know.”  
I coughed. “Shut up, Tyler,” I said between gasps. Not everyone is as fit or as perfect as you.”
He smiled at me and then looked out the window.  
I reached into my backpack and grabbed a spare brush that I always kept handy. My blonde hair was so thick with knots, that it took almost all my strength to brush the tangles out. I just couldn’t figure out how I could go to bed every night with smooth hair, and in the morning look like a family of rats had taken up residence in it. 
“Looking good,” sneered Katie, who was sitting across me.  Katie, the bitch, looked as though she got up every morning at three a.m. just to get ready for school. Her hair was always in place, make-up just right, and she never had chipped nails.  
“Screw you,” I mumbled in her general direction. I was definitely not in the mood to deal with her bullshit this morning.
Her eyes narrowed.  “What did you just say to me?”    
I knew she was looking for a fight, and I was so not going to let it happen. “Nothing,” I replied as innocently as possible.
“Yeah, that’s what I thought,” she replied, still glaring at me. Then, thankfully, she turned to her neighbor to finish whatever conversation they’d been having, which I’m sure was regarding foreign policies, welfare, or world hunger.  
I smirked.
Yeah, just the thought of that made me want to laugh out loud.  Katie, who was pretty and popular, was also as vapid as they came. Conversations with her included - who wore it best at an award show, or which color of eye-shadow would make her eyes “pop,”
Pathetic.
I stuffed the brush back into my backpack, and zoned out the rest of the way to school, thinking about the future. I was in my senior year and could not wait to start college in the fall. I had already been accepted to the University of Minnesota, and am not a brainiac or anything, but I have to say that I do “okay.”  Fortunately, schoolwork had always come pretty easy, and I’d never had to really worry about it.  Tyler, on the other hand, was a totally different story.  He’d excelled in sports, but had always struggled in school since the first grade. Many times in the mornings, I’d be quizzing him on the bus, and no matter how hard we’d studied together, he’d still only average a “C.”  Anyway, as far as I knew, Tyler had not made any plans for the fall yet, and he hated talking about it, which drove me nuts.  I‘d even tried pushing him on a few occasions, telling him the importance of college, but he’d get so pissed off.
“Rani,” he’d once said. “I already have a mom; I don't need you nagging me, too.”
I’d agreed and zipped my lips, hoping he’d eventually figure it out on his own. I just hated to see my best friend flounder.
Tyler.
He actually was a very good-looking guy - tall, with brown hair and the bluest eyes I’d ever seen on anyone.  His body wasn't so bad either; all those years of football and hockey had given him muscles in all of the right places.  
My other friends had always ribbed me about not going out with him, but even as good-looking as Tyler was, however, we just never really had a “spark.” I had certainly seen my share of “Rom-coms”, and according to those movies, I should have seen rainbows and butterflies when I kissed a guy. Hell, I’d settle for fluffy clouds and a horse. In fact, last year we’d both gone to a party at Mindy McGann's house.  Mindy's parents had been out of town, and her older brother, Luke, had purchased a keg of beer for the party.  I normally never drank, but that night I’d felt a little daring. So, I’d played Beer Pong with some classmates, and lo-and-behold, I sucked.  Apparently, Beer Pong is a lot harder than it looks.  In fact, twenty-five minutes into the game, I had already chugged five beers from my red Solo cup.  It was then that I’d started to feel warm and a little dizzy. So, I’d gone in search of Tyler, who’d been sitting around the television playing video games with a bunch of other jocks.
“Tyyyyylerrrr,” I’d slurred and then giggled at the sound of my voice. When he didn’t answer, I’d repeated it louder. “Tyyyyylerrr! Come on, let's go.”
Tyler had looked at me with a furrowed brow. “Hang on a minute, Rani. I’m about to blast this zombie.”
“Tyyyyy…” I’d whined, but then had been unable to finish because the damn Beer Pong beer decided, in that very bad moment, to return to the party. I felt my mouth begin to water and I knew exactly what was going to happen. I tried to hold it in, but it was pointless, the beer was coming back and there wasn’t a damn thing I could do to stop it. I turned my head and the beer and cheese doodles that I’d been munching on earlier ended up all over Mindy’s couch and Jake Callun’s head. 
“My bad,” I mumbled to nobody in particular.
“Oh, Christ, Rani,” Tyler had muttered. Then he’d, grabbed me around the waist and hoisted me up over his shoulder.
I then hiccupped-slash-burped and said, “sorry” to a horrified Jake, who was looking down at his coveted letterman’s jacket, which was now decorated with bits of bright orange doodles.
Thank God Tyler was a good athlete, because he had us out of that home in under ten seconds. 
When we’d gotten to Tyler's car, he put me in the front seat and buckled me in like a child. “You’d better not hurl in my car,” he’d warned, getting in next to me.
Still slightly dizzy, I didn’t say anything, only closed my eyes as we drove.
“What the hell were you thinking?” he’d asked sternly after a few minutes of silence. “I mean, seriously, Rani?”
I still hadn’t wanted  to talk, so I’d just shrugged my shoulders.  
“Well, I certainly can't take you home in this condition,” he’d said with a sigh. “So, let's just go to a park and chill out for a while.”  
I’d agreed.
When we’d reached the park and got out of the car for some fresh air, it had made me feel much better.
“Here,” he’d ordered handing me a stick of gum.    
I’d popped the gum into my mouth and the minty flavor had never tasted so good.
“Better?”
“Yes,” I’d answered and then began to shiver from the chill in the air.  
He’d noticed and removed his jacket.  “Here, put this on”.
I’d thanked him quietly and then had slipped it on.  The jacket had still been warm from his body heat and had felt awesome. Feeling better, I’d nudged in a little closer to him and then rested my head on his shoulder.  “Tyler,” I’d whispered after we’d sat there for some time.  “I don't really know what I’d do without you.”
He’d chuckled. “Right back at ya.”
Smiling, I’d sat up and then we’d both stared at each other in silence. When no words were spoken by either of us, I’d reached for him, gently pulling his face closer to mine. We kissed, and then kissed some more, and I was waiting for the fireworks, or some type of spark, but there was… nothing.  
Eventually, we’d pulled away from each other and then both of us had started laughing at the same time. “Well I guess it is true,” I’d said, as our laughter died down.
“What?”  
I’d smiled. “Men and women can just be just friends.”
Shaking his head and smiling, he’d unlocked the door and drove me home.
 
Chapter Two

Rani

The school year was coming to an end, and as I walked the halls, I noticed that they were still pretty empty.
Damn, that flu virus must be really spreading, I thought in dismay, hoping that I wouldn’t catch it.
Recently, we’d been informed about a rampant flu that was going around, and had been told to make sure that we washed our hands frequently, and stayed home if we were not feeling well.  Both Tyler and I had been fortunate enough not to catch the bug yet, so our lives went on as usual.  But, as time went on, I’d begun to notice that the students and faculty that had been out sick, returned to the school a little bit different than they had been before.
On Wednesday, I noticed a huge change in my Social Science teacher. Mrs. Conolly, was usually a shy, quiet, mousy-haired teacher. Normally, she wore the same kind of outfit every day, which consisted of slacks and turtlenecks. She also usually spoke quietly, her voice barely above a whisper. 
When she returned to school that morning after being out sick for a few days with the flu, she looked like a new woman. She’d dyed her hair a platinum-blonde, was wearing form-fitting clothes, and held a new demeanor that demanded attention.
“Hey, Mrs. Conolly,” smirked Jake McNally, eyeing the teacher up and down on her first day back. “Looking good.”
I’d expected her to blast him for talking to her like that.  Instead, she just smiled and said, “I know, Mr. McNally, and I am feeling good, too.” Then, they’d shared a smile as Jake took his seat.
I stared with my mouth open. Was she serious, did I just hear that?  
The class bell rang and the rest of the students took their seats.  Many of the boys in the class were whispering to each other, and one kid in the class starting humming “Hot for Teacher”, a song by Van Halen.  This made the rest of the class burst out laughing.
I sat quietly, waiting for Mrs. Conolly to bring the class to order, but she didn't. Instead, she turned around and went to the chalkboard. Then, she started writing down the next day’s assignment, and I swear - it looked as if she was purposely bending over seductively, trying to give the guys in the front row a show.
I glanced at the girl sitting next to me and she looked just as disturbed as I felt.
Stunned, I looked again at my teacher, and almost threw up in my mouth.
Mrs. Conolly was twerking!
I didn’t think anything else could rattle me as much as that did.
Boy, was I ever wrong.

Chapter Three

Tyler



 
“Tyler!” my mom called. “It’s time for dinner. Wash up and come downstairs!”
I shut off the television, dragged myself out of bed, and went into my bathroom to wash up. When I stepped into the dining room, both of my parents looked at me with odd expressions.
“What’s up?” I asked.
Mom forced a smile. “Um, not much. Hope you’re hungry.”
Even though my mom had made my favorite, chicken enchiladas, I had to admit, I wasn’t feeling very hungry. There was a dance coming up the following week and I’d been trying to think of a way to invite Rani without scaring her off. Although she’d always insisted that we were just friends, I still couldn’t help the intense feelings that I kept hidden from her. Every time we were together, and she smiled up at me or laughed, I wanted to grab her and try that kiss one more time. Make her want me the way that I wanted her. But, I was afraid it would destroy our friendship, and at least that was something.
“Dig in,” my father said as he scooped a generous helping of enchiladas onto his plate.  “Looks good, Diane,” he continued, adding a large dollop of sour cream to the top.
“Thanks, sweetheart,” she replied, beaming at him. “Just try to save enough for the rest of us.” She turned to me. “Tyler, honey, you better grab some before your Dad takes it all.”
I nodded and put a small piece on my plate. As I picked at my food, an image of Rani popped into my head again.  How in the hell was I going to get her to go with me to the dance? I knew she wanted to go, and there was no way I’d be able to handle it if she went without me. No way.
“You okay,” asked mom.
I looked up from my food. “Yeah. Fine.”
“Okay,” she replied, staring at me curiously.
I glanced over at my dad, who normally had half of his plate devoured before I even started, and noticed that he’d barely touched his enchiladas. In fact, as he stared down at his pile of food, he actually looked a little sad.
“Hey, Dad,” I teased. “What's the problem? Is it too spicy for ya?” We and had the same inside joke.  A year ago, we’d gone to the Minnesota State fair and had entered a jalapeno eating contest together. Before we’d even arrived in the parking lot, he’d bragged that since he’d married mom, he’d grown a cast-iron stomach.
“Son, the secret to eating spicy food is to just swallow it whole, and plug your nose,” he’d informed me after we’d sat down at the picnic table, waiting for the contest to begin.
“Okay,” I’d replied, trying to sound braver than I actually felt.  I’d had jalapenos before, but not a lot, and definitely not in one sitting.
“On your mark… get set… go!” yelled the announcer, after they’d given all ten of us a quart-sized bowl of the whole peppers.
I still remember looking down at them, and just the smell had made my eyes water. I’d glanced over at my dad, who’d already swallowed at least ten and was stuffing in another, when I’d noticed his eyes - they were watering and he also had sweat running down his face.
“You okay?” I’d whispered.
Instead of answering me, he’d turned the most curious color of green I’d ever seen.  Next thing I knew, he opened his mouth and projected a gush of vomit so intense, that it would have given that kid, Regan, from The Exorcist movie a run for her money.
“Oh, my God!” a woman had cried, sitting in the front row, and who was now covered in chunks of jalapenos, corn dogs, and cotton candy. “You’ve got to be kidding me?!”
I’d tried to stifle a giggle as everything began to unravel around us. First, the obese farmer sitting next to my dad must have caught a whiff of the puke, because he also lost it. Then, to everyone’s horror, down the line, each contestant began sputtering, gagging, and emptying out their stomachs.
“Come on,” groaned dad, grabbing me by the neck of my T-shirt. His face was pale and his lips were swollen from the peppers and stomach acid. “Let's get out of here.” We ran to the nearest bathroom where I watched as he tried his best to clean up.
“Let me guess, the swallowing thing backfired,” I’d teased as he blotted his face with wet paper towels. “And it was too much for your wimpy stomach.”
“Smartass,” he’d replied, trying his best not to smile. “Uh, let's go home before the locals catch up with us. They might just hang us up by our toenails if they find us.”
Picturing my dad hanging by his yellow toenails had made me gag. “Yeah, let’s cruise.”
Obviously, thinking back to the contest, my dad looked up from his plate of enchiladas and winked. “Don’t remind me. That had to be the most embarrassing day of my life.”
“Oh, you’ve had worse,” said mom, and they shared a smile.
I stuffed a forkful of food in my mouth. As I began to chew, I watched my parents curiously. For some reason, neither of them were eating. They both just stared down at their plates somberly.
“You guys sick?” I asked.
“No,” they both said in unison.
“Okay,” I said, watching them curiously. I ate a few more bites and then put my fork down. I just couldn’t do it. Thoughts of Rani were still interfering with my own appetite. “May I be excused?”  
“Yes,” she answered, smiling almost nervously. “Why don’t you go the living room; we’re going to have a family meeting.”
I pushed myself away from the table, and then wandered into the living room. Plopping down into the oversized couch, I wondered what this was about. “Family meetings” weren’t something our family did very often.  
A little tense, and with the spicy food not really settling very well in my stomach, I began to worry that the enchiladas would make a second appearance, and I grimaced.
Dad came in first, followed by my mom.  They sat down in the loveseat across from me, and for some reason, I noticed that they both had a mixture of fear and nervousness on their faces.
“Tyler,” my dad began, “your mother and I have some very important news for you, and frankly, we just don't know how to begin.”  
My mom then interrupted him. “What your father is trying to say, is that we have invited a man over to talk with you.”
“A man? Why, what’s going on?” I exclaimed, sitting up straighter. “You’re not sending me off to some swanky college on the other side of the country, are you? I told you I’d be just as happy if I stayed in town.”
My parents looked at each other and chuckled. “No, dear,” my mom replied. “Nothing like that.”
Just then, the doorbell rang. My mom glanced nervously over toward my father before she got up to answer the door.
I could hear the door open, followed by a hushed conversation right before the stranger entered our living room. I had to admit, he was an impressive looking figure - well over six feet, blond hair that was tied back into a ponytail, broad shoulders, and a strong chin. I’d actually expected someone in a suit from a college or church group, but this guy wore a pair of loose-fitting jeans, a black leather jacket, and a dark T-shirt. He actually didn't look much older than me, maybe a few years or so.
“This is our son, Tyler,” my dad said, introducing me the stranger. “Tyler, this is Phillip.”
“Please, please,” replied the man, holding out his hand. “Call me Phil. It’s very nice to meet you, Tyler.”
I shook his hand. “Nice to meet you, too, Phil.”
“Please, Phillip, err… I mean Phil, have a seat,” said my mom, sounding nervous.
I watched Phil as he sat down, trying to size him up, and wondering what the hell he was doing here and what it could possibly do with me.
“Tyler,” Phil began, staring at me intently. “Have your parents told you anything about the exciting changes that are happening across the world?”
I shook my head.
“Well,” he continued. “There have been many technological advances in the past few years that have made it possible for the human body to stop aging.”
Raising my eyebrows, I glanced over at my parents, expecting them to burst out laughing over the absurdity of what this man was saying.
“Ty,” my mom said, noticing my expression. “Just hear Phil out”
“Fine,” I said, sitting back in the sofa. I crossed my arms over my chest. “But so far, I still have no idea what the hell is going on here.”
“Our company,” Phil continued, “has found a way to prolong human life indefinitely. Here, take a look at this video. It will give you an idea of what I’m talking about.” He then pulled his laptop out of his messenger bag, and slid in a CD labeled “Eternals.” The whole room was silent as we watched him prepare the video.  When it began, I noticed that it looked like it was shot inside of a hospital room.  There was a man on the table, and he had some kind of electrodes on his scalp and chest.
“The readouts are of his brain and heart rate measurements,” said Phil, pointing to the machines next to the bed.  
We continued to watch the screen. The video went on for a few moments, just showing the man lying there with the machines around him beeping and buzzing. Then another man entered the room wearing hospital scrubs. He pulled out a long needle and syringe and then plunged it into the patient’s thigh.  The man on the bed immediately started to convulse, and the machines that were monitoring his vitals started going nuts. The heart rate monitor, previously at around sixty, sky-rocketed all the way to two-hundred.  I watched in disbelief as it quickly started to plummet back down. One-ninety-five, one-hundred, sixty, thirty, twenty, fifteen, ten, and then… flat-line.
“What the fuck was that?” I screamed in horror looking at my parents, then to Phil. “Why would you make me watch a man die? What kind of sick, twisted joke is this?”
“Honey” my mom said as calm as she could. “Just sit down and watch the rest.”
I ignored my mother. “Dad,” I implored. “Please tell me what’s going on…”
“Sit down, son, and watch the rest of the video,” he replied evenly. “Then we can finish our conversation. You’ll understand in a few minutes.”
I reluctantly sat back down.
Phil, who had paused the video, studied me closely and then restarted it.
I sighed.
The man on the video now lay motionless, obviously dead. The video camera moved and focused on the man’s slack face. After about one or two minutes, I saw it.  
The man’s eyelids began moving rapidly!  
I moved closer to the laptop screen, not believing what I was seeing.  The machines that were once silent began beeping again.  The heart monitor now indicated a normal heart-rate of close to sixty.
What the heck?
The patient on the table, who had just been dead, was now being helped to sit up.  He looked at the camera with a twinkle in his eyes, and gave a thumbs-up.  Then the screen went black.
Staring at the blank screen for what seemed like an eternity, I turned to Phil. “How, how is that possible? I saw it with my own two eyes - that dude was dead.”
“That is what I am trying to tell you, Tyler,” Phil said, smiling triumphantly. “We have found a serum that will allow humans to never age, never get sick. You’ll have the same results. Of course, in order to sustain life, your diet will need to change.”
“What?” I asked.
He smirked. “Oh, you’ll get used to it.”
“Get used to what?” I asked, feeling the hair stand up on the back of my neck..
He shrugged. “Blood. Preferably human.”
I stared at him in disbelief. “That’s just wrong,” I said, shaking my head vehemently. “A diet of blood?”
“Think about it - your body is made of about sixty percent of water and you need to keep replenishing it daily. This is almost the same thing, only you’ll be immortal and live forever because of the blood.” He grinned. “A true Eternal.”
I glared at him. “We were never intended to live forever.”
“Whether we were or weren’t,” said Phil. “It doesn’t matter, because now we can. You can.”
“No,” I said firmly. There was no way that I was going to drink blood. The thought repulsed me.
“Yes,” said Phil, his eyes turning cold. “And as you’ll see, you don’t have much of a choice.”
“No way!” I yelled, turning toward my parents. “No way will I ever become a freak of nature! How could you even ask me to participate in something like this? It’s wrong!”
“Son, it isn’t wrong. In fact,” my dad said softly. “We’ve already done it.”
“What?!” I shouted, staring at him in disbelief.
“We did,” said mom, her eyes filling with tears. “We did it for us, our family.”
“Bullshit!!” I retorted. “You made this decision without talking with me first, you and her!” I hollered while pointing at my mother accusingly. “You two did this for yourselves; don't pretend for one second that your decision was based on anything but your selfishness!”
“Tyler!” barked my dad as I ran up to my room and slammed the door.
Could this really be happening?  Am I getting ‘Punk'd’? Is Ashton Kutcher going to jump out of my closet?
I sat down on my bed, trying to process what had just happened.  Phil claimed that we can live forever... never age... or get sick. Oh, but by the way, the only way you can survive is on human blood.  How the fuck did I just end up in some Twilight bullshit?
I opened my door just a crack, straining my ears so I could hear what was going on downstairs, but I could only hear mumbled voices. I quietly edged the door open a little further to see if I could hear any better, but damned if I still couldn’t hear shit. Trembling and angry, I slowly opened the door and crept silently to the top of the stairs.
“I am sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Jacobson,” Phil was saying, “but, you do know what has to be done, and you also know the repercussions if it is not taken care of,” he paused, “tonight.”
What has to be done? What repercussions could he be talking about, and why would my parents ever put our family in jeopardy?
I heard my mother start to cry. “I just can’t… I just can't do it,” she said through her tears.
“What other choice do we have?” my father asked. “Tyler has made it perfectly clear that he does not want to go through with it.”
“Well,” my mom said sternly, “we can force him to do it. We -”
Phil interrupted her. “I am sorry, Mrs. Jacobson, but the agreement clearly states that an individual, who is over the age of eighteen, has free will on what they choose to do. The choice is - become one of us, or die. There is no in-between or gray area.”
“I.., just... can't... do... it,” said my mother between sobs.
I heard footsteps and the front door slamming.
“Mr. Jacobson, it has to be done. Now,” Phil said in a tone which almost sounded remorseful. “Either I do it… or you do.”
I could hear my father’s heavy footsteps pacing back and forth on the wooden floor in the living room.  Was he actually considering letting this crazy stranger kill me, or worse yet, trying to kill me himself?
“Ok,” he said in a husky voice. “I will do it, but… I want to do it alone.”
“That is fine by me, Mr. Jacobson,” Phil conceded. “But, I will be back here in the morning, and I will need proof that your son is dead. Make no mistake - if you fail, not only do you lose your life, but the life of your wife as well.”
“I understand” my father said. “I will take care of it.”
“Good.”
It sounded as if Phil was packing up his laptop. Was he really going to leave my dad alone?  I grinned. What a sucker. There was no way that my dad would ever kill me, I thought. He must have a plan for us to get out of this situation.
They moved to the front door and I could still faintly make out a conversation that my father was having with Phil, reassuring him that he’d take care of everything. Then the door opened and closed.
I held my breath, waiting for my dad to come upstairs and tell me what the plan was.  I waited and waited for what seemed like an eternity, but then I could hear my father beginning to pace again in the living room.  
What the hell was he doing?  Was he actually considering going through with it?!  
I silently crept down the stairs and stood in the hallway as silently as I could, wondering what to do.  I peeked around the corner and saw him pacing.  
I bit my lower lip, considering my options. I could just approach him and pretend that I was blissfully unaware of the conversation that he and Phil just had.  “Hey, Dad, crazy shit about that vampire kind of stuff, huh?  Wanna go shoot some hoops?”  I smiled in spite of myself over the crazy notion.  Just then, my father abruptly stopped and went into the kitchen.  I heard the kitchen drawers opening and closing, he then headed back through the living room with a chef's knife.  
My stomach dropped and I immediately felt dizzy.  It was clear, he had made his decision.


***
 
Phil

Those were the house calls I hated the most, families that did not see eye-to-eye.  I did understand that making such a life-changing decision must be hard for them, but normally once the shock wore off, the majority of people jumped at the chance of becoming immortal.
Who could resist the gift of living forever, without aging or getting sick?
Of course, they did not realize that living like that had its drawbacks. Nor did they realize how long ‘forever’ really was.
I, unfortunately, was never given a choice.  
I am the son of one the most powerful and well respected pure Eternals in the world, a pure Eternal is one whose bloodline has not been tainted with human blood.  My mother was born a human and my father, one-hundred percent Eternal.  It was actually my DNA that was used to create the serum DD8. I cringe when I think about the trials that failed before they finally got the serum right. Even now I shudder when I think back to the poor homeless man who had been the first human guinea pig for DD1.  We had picked him up from an alley behind a biker bar in Minneapolis. We’d promised him one hundred dollars for just taking a ride with us.  
The man had hopped into the van without hesitation, his eyes full of desperation.
“So whatcha guys need me to do?” he’d asked in a low, gravelly voice. “I ain't no queer, so don't you be getting any funny ideas.”
“Relax” I’d told him. “We just need to test out a new flu shot.”
“Flu?” he’d replied, looking at us with uncertainty. “You don't look like no doctors to me.”
I’d laughed, because he was right; we did not look like doctors.  We’d looked more like a rock band.  Big John had been the driver and Steve Marder, my right-hand man. Big John had been just shy of five feet and couldn't have weighed more than a hundred pounds.  He’d had long, stringy black hair and tattoos that covered almost every inch of his pale body.  He’d definitely looked like a bad-ass when he was sitting down, but unintimidating as all hell when he stood up.  Actually, I’d always thought he’d looked like a fifth grader gone bad.  Steve, on the other hand, had been the exact opposite.  Six-foot-five, Native American who weighed in at three-hundred pounds and looked like he could squash you like a bug if you looked at him wrong.  I’d been his best friend for years, and was still slightly intimidated by the son-of-a-bitch.  
“Nah,” I’d replied. "We aren't doctors, we just work for them”
“How long this gonna take?” the homeless man asked. “I got me a hot date later.”
“You do, huh?” I’d answered with a laugh.
“Shit yeah, I do,” the homeless man had replied seriously. “Do you know how much ass a hundred bucks can buy me?”
I’d shuddered to myself thinking about the “ass” the man would be getting later.
We’d driven the rest of the day in silence until we’d reached my father’s research facility.  
The Knightingdale.  
Knightindale during the day was a hustling and bustling legitimate research company whose primary objective was food safety.  They were responsible for making sure that all foods being served to large institutions, such as hospitals, schools, and prison were being handled properly and contained the correct amount of nutritional value as outlined by the government.  I worked there a few summers back as an intern, and I was shocked at the amount of rodent hair and feces which was legally allowed.
We’d driven to the back of the facility. Then after we’d all piled out, we walked up to the huge iron door at the back entrance.  I’d pushed the buzzer and we waited.  Finally, my father had opened the door.
“Follow me” he said shortly, “we don't have much time.”
My father was a very intimidating-looking man. He was an inch or two taller than me, had the same crew cut for years, and his eyes were darkest brown I have ever seen. Sometimes they even looked black.
We followed my father down the hall, and the homeless man had to do a slight jog just to keep up with us. We stopped just outside of one of the smaller research labs.
“Get undressed,” my father barked at the homeless man.
“Hey, Doc, I already told your cronies here that I aint into the gay stuff,” the homeless man said, sounding a bit nervous.
“Strip down to your boxers,” my father said, ignoring the homeless man’s previous comments. “And follow me.”
“It's ok,” I reassured him. “We just need you to get undressed so he can monitor your vitals.”
“Well, he shoulda just said that, for Christ sakes,” the homeless man said as he removed his shirt. “He don't need to be such a dick about it.”
If you had any idea about what a dick he really is, my friend, you would be running out of here right now, I thought.
 The room had been transformed and really did look like a legitimate hospital room.  In the middle of the room was a hospital bed, and on either side was a heart monitor and what looked like a ventilator.
“Gimme my hundred bucks,” homeless guy said to me. “Don't wanna do this until I see the dough.”
I pulled a hundred out of my wallet. “Here,” I said, handing it over. “This will be the quickest hundred bucks you will ever make.”
“Better be,” he said. “Standing around in a room full of dudes in my skivvies is not how I pictured my day going.”
“Quit with the chatter,” my Father demanded. “You,” he said, pointing at the homeless man. “Get on the bed.”
The man quietly walked to the bed and lay down.  He looked like he was beginning to get a little nervous.
“Dude,” I said “I promise you, one quick shot and we are outta here, then you can go get that ass.” I smiled and gave him a high five.
The man seemed to relax a bit, that is, until my father started to strap his arms down.
“What the hell is this?” he asked as my father tightened the first strap.
“It is for your protection,” my father answered flatly.
“What the hell kind of flu shot requires straps?” the homeless man asked.
My father quickly looked at me inquisitively,
 I just shrugged my shoulders.
“In case you have an allergic reaction,” I answered the man quickly.  That seemed to settle the man down enough for my father to attach the remaining three straps.
The man was swiftly connected to all the tubing and wiring necessary to monitor his vitals.  He was calm as my father attached the last piece of wire to the metal disc.
“Yo,” the man said, looking over at it. “This ain’t gonna hurt, is it?  I may look like tough dude, but man, I hate pain.”
“No,” I replied, not really sure how to answer him.  We’d never done this before. I hoped for his sake that this really would be painless and quick. That he could walk out of here and go get laid.
“Enough!” my father snapped. “We have to do this now, time is running out.”
I looked at the clock. It was already three a.m. The facility opened at six a.m., but sometimes the scientists arrived earlier.
My father pulled the syringe out of his pocket and looked over at me. “You forgetting something, Phil?” he asked.  
Oh shit, I’d almost forgotten.
I grabbed the camcorder out of the bag and hastily began recording.
“I am ready,” I said to my father.
He shook his head and pushed the needle into the man’s vein.  The man held his breath as the serum was then pushed through.
“Aw... geez,” the man complained. “It hurts.”
I held the camcorder as still as I could, making sure the man and the machines were all in the shot. After a few minutes, the man’s blood pressure and heart rate started to drop.  The man seemed to be gasping for air.  My gut reaction was to throw the camera down and try to help him, but I knew I couldn't.  I agreed to do this and I had to keep filming.
The heart rate monitor was now a flat line.  He was dead.  
My father quickly checked the man’s vitals and was taking notes as he checked all the machines.
Then I heard it. Beep… Beep...
 It worked!! My father had done it!
Then it sped up. Beep. Beep. Beep.Beep.Beep The machine started to go haywire.  
My father ran to the man and took his pulse. “NO! NO! NO!” he shouted. “This is not supposed to happen.”
“What can I do?” I yelled to him.
“Nothing!” he yelled back. “Just keep recording, dammit!”
I watched in horror as the scene unfolded before me.  The homeless man was now convulsing fiercely. His mouth began to foam and his eyes seemed to be bulging out of his head.  He then opened his lips and it looked as if he was trying to scream, but nothing came out.  
I looked over at my father, who was still racing around the bed, trying to keep track of the changes in his vitals. Then, as quickly as it began… it stopped.
The man now lay motionless on the bed.  He had blood pouring out of all of his orifices.
 I swallowed the saliva that had quickly formed at the sight of his blood.  
“SON OF A BITCH!” my father yelled, throwing the clipboard he was holding against the wall. He turned to me. “Clean this up and get him out of here,” he ordered, and then stormed out the door.
I turned the camcorder off and looked toward Big John and Steve. They looked just as shocked as I was after witnessing such a spectacle.
“Come on,” I said. “Let's get this cleaned up.”
“Hey, boss, can we get some of that?” Steve asked, looking at the homeless man.
“No” I replied softly. “His blood is tainted, too dangerous.”
I wrapped the homeless man in the sheet that was on the bed, feeling guilty.  
I was nothing like my father.  I may be an Eternal, like him, but I respected life, even if it was a human life.

Chapter Four

Rani

Later that afternoon, when I arrived home from school, I was still thinking about Mrs. Conolly’s strange behavior, when my cell phone buzzed.
It was Tyler.  
I answered. “Hey, Ty, what's going on?”
“Meet me at the park in twenty minutes,” he whispered.
I started to answer him, “I have too much home-”
 He cut me off.  “Meet me in twenty,” and then disconnected from the other end.
I sighed loudly as I put my phone back into my sweatshirt. What in the hell was that about?
I went to the fridge and grabbed a bottle of water and a granola bar from the pantry.  I was famished after being in school all day and something told me that I needed food in order to deal with the rest of the afternoon.  Then, I left the house and started the two-block walk to the park, where I found Tyler sitting alone on a bench.
I walked over to him. “What is with the Cloak and Dagger routine?” I ribbed. “Did you watch too many of your 007 movies?”
Tyler didn’t speak, only glanced around nervously as people walked by us in the park.
“Tyler?”
He motioned for me to keep quiet.
I normally would have laughed off his foolishness, but the look of fear in his eyes made the hair on my arms stand on-end.  
Standing up, he nodded for me to follow him to his car, but once inside, he still remained aloof and quiet.  Then he started the engine and we left, turning onto the main street of town. It wasn’t until we drove around for a few minutes that he finally he spoke up.  “Something awful has happened,” he said, with a tear slowly rolling down his cheek.
“Tyler, you’re starting to scare me. Please just tell me what’s going on,” I pleaded.
Tyler pulled into the parking lot of a convenience store and parked the car.  He turned toward me. “Now, Rani, I just want you to hear me out,” he said with desperation. “And please, don't think I’m crazy.”
I looked at him closely, trying to see if he was being serious, or just giving me a line of shit. The look on his face confirmed the latter.
“My mom and dad are dead,” he said quietly, looking out the window.
“Tyler, that’s not funny! I just saw your mom and dad yesterday at the grocery store,” I replied, refusing to believe what he was telling me.
He looked over at me. “I’m serious, Rani, they’re dead, and it’s all my fault.”
“What do you mean, it’s your fault?
“It’s my fault they’re dead,” he repeated, and then looked down at his hands again. “I killed them.”

 
Chapter Five

Rani

“Please tell me you’re kidding,” I begged Tyler. “Tell me that this is some kind of joke.”  
I could tell just by looking at him that he was definitely not kidding.  His eyes, usually full of life and love, were filled with fear and anxiety.  His clothes were disheveled, his hair was messy, and he even had little cuts on his hands and face. He looked… terrible.
“I have to get out of here, Rani,” he said. “They will come looking for me.”	
“They who?” I asked. “The police?”
“I wish,” he said, running a hand through his hair. “The police would be a helluva lot better than who is really coming after me.”
“This is crazy, Tyler,” I said, growing more and more annoyed by the James Bond behavior. “Who is they, and why would they be coming after you?”
He held up his hand. “Look, I promise, I will explain it all to you later, but I don't feel safe here. I just don't want to put you in any jeopardy,” he replied and then looked into his rearview mirror nervously.
“Tyler, you’re my best friend and I want to help you, but I can't unless you tell me what's going on.”
Something or someone must have caught his attention, because he tensed up and then insisted that I get out of the car.
“You’ve gotta get outta here,” he repeated urgently. “NOW!”
“But Tyler, I can help you,” I begged. “Please let me help you.”
“No, Rani, you’re my best friend and I love you way too much to drag you into this shit,” he said sternly. “I’ll try to call you once I feel safe. But please, if anyone starts asking you questions, just tell them that the last time you saw me was yesterday, at school.” He then reached over me, opened the car door, and then, kissed my cheek. “Now go!” he ordered, half pushing me out of the car. “I swear, I’m only thinking of you. Shit, I shouldn’t have even picked you up.”
Feeling defeated, I stepped out of the car and then bent down to look at his face. I wasn’t even sure how it was possible, but overnight he’d gone from a carefree teenager, to what seemed like a stressed out middle-aged man. Just by looking at the anguish on his face, I could tell that whatever had happened to him, it had changed him forever.
“Tyler,” I said softly. “Just remember, I will always be here for you.”
“I know.”  
I closed the door and watched as his car drove off into the distance.  What the hell am I supposed to do now?
Just then my cell phone rang.
My heart raced, hoping it was Tyler and that he was going to tell me that it was all a joke and was coming back around to pick me up.  I looked at the caller I.D.
 Dad.
“Hey, dad,” I said, trying to sound as normal as possible. “What's up?”
“What's up is dinner,” he replied, sounding annoyed.
I looked at the time - it was already six-fifteen, which meant that I was already fifteen minutes late.
“Ah crap, Dad,” I said. “I totally lost track of time. I’ll be home right away.”
“Just make it quick, your mom made her famous chili,” he said, and I could hear the amusement in his voice.
“In that case, maybe I should crawl home.”
“Nobody likes a smart mouth, young lady,” he replied teasingly. “Just hurry up so I don’t have to do this alone.”
I grinned. “I will.”
“Good.”
I hung up and thought about my mom, the “Homemaker.” She always loved to cook, clean, and take care of my dad, but the problem was that she’s a horrible cook.  Once, when we were out having a nice fried-chicken dinner, she’d decided that it made no sense to leave the house for the same meal she could make at home and decided to make her own special recipe, giving the restaurant a “run for their money.” When she’d mentioned it, my dad and I had exchanged fearful glances, knowing that once she’d put her mind to something, nothing would change it. So, the following week at dinner, my mom had surprised us with something that looked like a platter of burnt potatoes.
“Viola!” she’d exclaimed proudly. “Fried chicken.”
I’d glanced at my dad’s face and knew from his expression that we were both terrified of the monstrosity that my mom had made.
She set the platter in the middle of the table, grinning from ear-to-ear. “What do you think?”
“Looks delicious,” my dad said through a gritted smile. “You have obviously outdone yourself again, dear.	
“Ah, you are so sweet to me, my darling,” she replied lovingly. “Just for that, you get to have the first helping.”
I’d had to bite my lip from bursting out laughing as my mom used her tongs to find the biggest piece of chicken on the platter.
“Lucky me,” he’d answered quietly, looking at me, with terror in his eyes.
I watched in horror as she’d placed the chicken down on his plate, and then scooped a large helping of very sad-looking mashed potatoes next to it. Then, she’d handed me a plate to fill. “Come on, Rani,” she’d urged. “Don’t be shy.”
I’d swallowed hard and looked at my dad, whose turn it was now to be amused.
“Don’t be shy, dear,” he’d said mimicking my mom with a twinkle in his eyes. “You don't want the food to get cold.”
Giving him the dirtiest of looks, I’d reached over and grabbed what appeared to be the smallest piece of chicken, and scooped some mashed potatoes onto my plate.  Looking down at the meal in front of me had almost made me want gag. The chicken actually looked as if it had been run over a few hundred times by the car. Looking even closer, I’d noticed that there were lumps in it.
LUMPS!
In the chicken!?
Grimacing, I’d tried using my fork to cut open the meat, but that had been a “no go.” That chicken had definitely needed the big guns.  
Grabbing a steak knife, I’d pierced it, watching in disgust as some kind of oily substance squirted out from somewhere under the skin, actually hitting me in the face, and temporarily blinding me.  As I’d wiped the juice from my face and glanced down at the leg, I’d almost felt like it had been mocking me.  
Oh, it’s on now, chicken. This is war,
Chicken: One.
Rani: Zero.
But not for long…
Clutching the knife firmly, I’d attacked the chicken with more force, removing the skin. Then, when I’d pushed it aside and looked down in victory at my opponent, my stomach had rolled in disgust. The meat was pink and raw.  
Stone cold.
Chicken: Two.
Rani: Out.
“Well for Pete's sake,” mom had complained, while cutting into her piece. “This chicken is raw.”
I’d looked at my dad and we’d shared a smile. We knew what that meant.
Pizza!
I pushed away that memory and decided to make a quick detour over to Tyler's house on the way home to see if he’d returned. I just couldn’t believe that he’d killed his parents and was running from someone. This was real life, not a movie.
I turned onto his street and crossed the road, walking as fast as I could.  As I looked toward his house, which was almost a block away, I could already tell there were no police cars or any other kind of action going on at his place. Still, my heart began to race as I neared his home. In fact, when I reached the front door, I almost ran away in a panic. Instead, I forced myself to be brave and rang the doorbell.
Nobody answered.
I tried it again and waited.
Still no one came to the door.  
He has to be messing with me, I thought. If he’d killed his parents, there’d be cops around and it would be a circus over here. This is ridiculous.
Turning around, I bound down the steps and took off into a light jog. I knew that my mom was going to be pretty pissed off that I was now almost thirty minutes late for dinner.  
When I finally made it home, I walked through the door and took off my sweatshirt.
“You’re in big trouble!” my mom hollered from the dining room. “Rani, you’re thirty minutes late! Go wash up and come to the table.”
I quickly went into the downstairs bathroom and washed my hands.  I looked in the mirror.
Holy cow, I was a mess!  
Not only was my hair was matted to my forehead from sweat, but my makeup had run, and my jeans were wet on the bottom from an earlier rain.
After washing my face, I ran a brush through my hair, rushed out of the bathroom, and took my seat at the table, hoping my parents would just be cool about me being late.     
“Sorry, guys,” I said, scooping up a bowl of  dry chili. “I was with Kelly and we lost track of time.”
To my surprise my mom replied, “Rani, we’ll let it slide this time, but next time you won’t be so lucky, young lady. You know how we feel about eating dinner as a family and not being late.”
I apologized again and tried eating as much of the bland chili as I could. I didn’t want to piss her off any more by not eating her food.
“How’s the chili?” asked my dad, his eyes dancing.
I lied through my teeth. “It’s really good. You’ve outdone yourself again, mom.”
She smiled.

 
Chapter Six

Rani

At school the next day, I expected to see Tyler in our homeroom, but he wasn’t there.
“Is Tyler sick?” I asked Mr. Peterman.
“Not sure,” replied Mr. Peterman, not appearing very worried about it. He’d actually stopped taking our class attendance last week, and none of us were really sure why.  John Oliver, our class president and honor roll student, had asked him why he no longer took attendance. Mr. Peterman’s response had been - “What's the point?”  
It was weird.
Where was Kelly? I thought, watching the door nervously. I hoped she wasn’t sick with the flu.
Kelly Newsauer was my best friend and I’d met her when we’d moved from Minneapolis to St. Paul at the end of fourth grade.  My dad had been hired by a large engineering corporation, and wanted to find a place closer to his work.  He had said that the commute from Minneapolis to St. Paul had been too chaotic.  Not only would he spend almost an hour in traffic, but when there was a snow storm, that time usually doubled. He’d had enough.
Unfortunately, we’d been unable to find a house right away in St. Paul, so his company had put us up in an apartment building while we’d continued our search. It was where I’d met Kelly.
I’d loved the apartments. The best part had been the pool right in the center of the complex.  We’d had a pool at our old house, and I’d been a regular little fish, often daydreaming about living under the water like a real mermaid. I thought it would have been such a cool life and spent countless hours at the pool, pretending to be one. One day, in June, I’d been jumping off the diving board when I’d noticed a red-haired girl in a red, white and blue striped bathing suit, who seemed to be about my age.  She, and a few younger kids, had been playing Marco-Polo. Wanting to join in, I’d swum to the shallow end where they were.
“Hey, can I play, too?” I’d asked eagerly.
“You bet,” the red-haired girl had answered. “But all newbies have to start off by being ‘Marco’.”
I’d agreed. “Marco!” I called out.
We’d spent the rest of the summer attached at the hip.  We would pack lunches, and ride our bikes all the way to Como Zoo, which was at least ten miles away.  We never even told our parents where we were going- we were ten years old and we were free.
Countless hours we’d spend at each other’s homes and boy had I loved going to her place.  Her family had the better snacks, while at my house you’d open up the refrigerator, only to find fruit and healthy stuff, like cottage cheese or carrots.
Kelly, on the other hand, had the good stuff. I used to love opening her cupboard and seeing all the things that my mom had banned in our place - like Twinkies, Ho-Ho's, and other sugary goodness. Now, those were the things that I really enjoyed sinking my teeth into. Many times we’d both load up on snacks and soda and drive everyone crazy with our sugar high. It was innocent and a lot of fun, but then one day in late August, Kelly had snatched a cigarette from her Aunt Carol who was in town visiting her family.
“Come on, Rani,” Kelly had said excitedly, grabbing me by the hand. “I have something cool to show you!”
We’d raced off to our secret spot, which was actually a brick wall behind our apartment building.
“What is it?” I’d asked breathlessly, as we’d reached the wall.
“Sit down,” she’d commanded, “and keep a look out!”
I’d looked around and saw no one.
“We’re in the clear,” I’d whispered.
She’d pulled something out of her shorts pocket and along with a book of matches.
A cigarette!
“Are you crazy?” I’d yelled at her. “No way am I touching that.”
“Come on,” she’d pleaded. “Don't you want to know what all the fuss is about?”
“Nope!” I’d protested, crossing my arms. “Those things smell horrible.”
Kelly had sat for a minute, staring at the cigarette, her wheels turning. I could tell that she’d been up to something, and that something usually ended up getting me grounded.
“OK,” she’d started. “I’ll make a deal with you- you take a puff of this, and I’ll sneak you out a whole bottle of root beer.”
Crap.
I’d given her a dirty look. She’d known exactly what to say and that my love of root-beer would surpass any reservations about cigarettes.
“Fine, one puff but that’s it,” I’d replied sternly.
Kelly put the cigarette into her mouth, lit the end, and took a long puff. Then, she’d immediately started coughing and hacking. When her coughing fit had ended, she’d handed me the cigarette. “Your turn,” she’d ordered with another cough.
I’d grabbed the cigarette and just the smell had made me want to throw up. After I took a puff, it seemed as if I was swallowing fire. I threw the cigarette behind me and immediately threw up.
Kelly had laughed so hard that she’d actually peed her pants.  What a pair we’d been - her with the pee-stained shorts, and me, with chunks of nasty vomit all over my shirt.  Still laughing, we’d rushed to her apartment where I changed into one of her shirts while she changed out of her pee-stained shorts. When she’d finished, she walked out of the room and then returned with the glorious two liter of root beer.
Life had never seemed better.
Today, I would have given anything to go back to those days.
Thankfully, Kelly made it to class right as the bell rang. Her red curls bounced as she rushed to her seat.  
“Ah, hell,” she said, setting down her backpack “Who are the idiots that think we really need to be at school by seven-thirty every single morning?”
“No doubt,” I replied.
Kelly was my one friend who could always make me laugh.  She had the quickest wit, and never seemed to care what anyone thought of her.
“So, Chicken,” she asked while putting on a layer of pink lip gloss. “What's shakin', besides my ass?”
Chicken was the nickname she’d given to me after I told her about the horrendous chicken ordeal at my house.  
“I need to talk to you about something very serious,” I said in a hush toned. “But not here. After school.”
“Oh, come on. You know how I hate waiting,” she said, with a pouty look. “You’ve got to tell me now that you brought it up.”
I shook my head vehemently. “No really, Kelly after school.”
She sighed.
“I’m serious. God, I should have waited to even bring it up.” I turned my head back to the front of the class, hoping she would get the hint.
My cell phone buzzed and I winced, hoping the teacher wouldn’t hear it. I carefully slid it out of my pocket and noticed that it was a text from Kelly.
 I hate secrets.
I shook my head and replied - NOT Now.
The phone buzzed. Come on.
No, I typed back.
Buzz. Fine! But be warned… I am going to keep bugging you all day!
I slipped my phone back into my jeans.
It began buzzing again.
Clenching my jaw, I glanced over at Kelly.
She quickly put her phone away and then feigned innocence.
I mouthed stop. I knew that if Mr. Peterman saw us using our phones, they would both be confiscated for the day, and our parents would have to come to school and pick them up.  The last thing I needed was to have my phone taken away.  I was just hoping among hope, that Tyler would call me. The fact that he wasn’t in school was now scaring the crap out of me.
I couldn’t wait to get out of school and find out what was going on, but, it seemed to last forever. When the last bell of the day rang, I ran to my locker and grabbed the books I would need for the weekend.  I had a huge calculus test on Monday and I knew that I really wasn’t as prepared as I should have been.
As I closed my locker, I saw Kelly rushing toward me, looking very determined. She was short, around five feet tall and had an athletic build, thanks to all the years of gymnastics. I used to envy her so much when we were little, because she was so petite and small. I’m medium built, not too fat or too skinny, and stood five-foot-eight.  I always felt like Sasquatch next to her, however.
“Tick-tock, Chicken,” she said breathlessly. “Time to spill the deets! What is this big secret of yours?”
For someone small, she was also very loud and boisterous. You could actually hear her coming a mile away. I only hoped that once I told her about my encounter with Tyler yesterday, that she wouldn’t freak out and let the entire school in on what had happened.
“It's Tyler,” I began.
“Oh my God, I knew it!” she exclaimed. “You finally let Tyler hit it! I knew it.”
I took a step back. “What?”
She grinned wickedly. “It's about time, Rani. That poor guy looks like his pants are going to explode every time he looks at you.”
“What in the hell are you talking about, Kelly?” I whispered loudly. You could say that I was a bit irritated with her assumption. “First off, no one has ‘hit’ this yet! And second, for the millionth time, Tyler and I are just friends and his pants have never come close to exploding.”
Kelly started to laugh. “Okay, okay, so you still proudly have your ‘V’ card. If your cherry is still intact, then what could possibly be such a ‘hush-hush’ secret?”
I looked around the halls, they were still buzzing with kids. “Let's walk to the park and we can talk there,” I said, grabbing my backpack.
“Okay.”
On our way to the park, Kelly's boyfriend, Wade, saw us walking and slowed the car
“Hey, Chicken,” he said, looking my way.
 I gave him a quick wave hello.  I liked Wade, but I knew as soon as he and Kelly got together, it would take a hose of cold water to pry them apart.
“Hey, sexy,” he said, to Kelly. “You want some candy?”
Kelly giggled and nodded.
“Well come over here then, Hotness,” he said. “I've got something sweet for you.”
I groaned loudly.
“Rani, I promise, I will be back in two secs,” she whispered, and then bounded for his car.
Right.
She opened the passenger door, and as soon as her butt hit the seat, the grope-fest started.  
I tried to look away, but it was like watching a train wreck, I just could not stop staring.  Kelly had squirmed over the front seat and was now directly on top of Wade, kissing and dry humping him. My eyes actually felt like they were bulging out of my head, as I stared in shock.
I knew Kelly and Wade had had sex before, but they weren't going to do it right here, were they?
I finally had to look away, my inexperience with sex bothering me more than I’d ever let on.  Most of the girls in my graduating class were no longer virgins.  I, on the other hand, was as close to a virgin as they came, although, there was that time I’d gotten my boobs groped by Bobby Linn in the tenth grade.
I thought back to that day. Kelly and I had gone over to Chris Stein’s for her sixteenth birthday party. She had invited most of our classmates, which included Bobby Linn, who I had been secretly crushing on for over a month. The night had been pretty tame at first. We’d played some music, danced, had cake and Chris had opened her presents. The action really started when her parents went upstairs and left us alone.
“I know,” said Kelly in a hushed tone. “Let's play Seven Minutes in Heaven.”
“What's that?” Chris asked worriedly. “It can't be loud, otherwise my parents will come right back down here.”
“Seven Minutes in Heaven,” Kelly began explaining, her cheeks turning slightly pink. “Is… cool. We all sit in a circle, spin the bottle, and whoever it lands on, you go in there,” she said and then pointed at the closet.
“What are we supposed to do in there?” asked another classmate, Erin.
“Whatever you want to do,” replied Kelly coyly.
None of us were really sure how this was going to pan out, or what exactly we’d do behind the closet door. We agreed to try it out, however, and slowly got into a circle.
Kelly grabbed an empty plastic two-liter bottle and looked at Chris. “I’d say that the birthday girl should go first,” she said, smiling wickedly.
Obviously nervous, Chris grabbed the bottle and set it on its side. Then, after a few seconds of hesitation, she gave it a spin.  
Around and around it went as we all watched in anticipation. When it finally stopped, it pointed toward Tyler.  
He quickly looked over at me.
 I gave him a “thumbs up.”
He looked away and his cheeks began to turn the cutest shade of pink.  Then, they both slowly got up and went into the closet.
Kelly watched the time on her watch as we all stared at each other, smirking.  Once the time was up, and the door opened, we all silently cheered them on.  
Then, they sat down and I noticed that they both refused to even look at each other.  Tyler later told me that she’d giggled the entire time, and that when he had tried to kiss her, it had been so dark that he’d missed and was pretty sure he kissed her eyeball.
“You’re up next, Rani,” Kelly said, tossing me the bottle.
My heart pounding, I spun the bottle, hoping it would not land on Scott.  Scott was notorious for having the worst breath. It smelled like a mixture of moldy cheese and feet.  I closed my eyes and soon heard the others make a collective gasp. When I opened them back up, I was thrilled beyond belief.
Bobby Linn!
Bobby Linn was one of the most popular boys in high school. He played football and hockey and excelled at them both.  He was just a bit taller than me, with the coolest California blonde surfer hair.  Even though I have actually never been to California, I assumed that all the boys there looked like Bobby.  I actually had him in a few of my classes, but never really thought he was hot until I saw him play hockey one day.  Watching him on the ice, the way he’d been able to skate effortlessly, how he’d held his stick with such authority, and the ease of how he’d handled the puck had really impressed me.
“Okay, you two,” said Kelly, smiling wickedly. “Have fun.”
I looked over to Tyler for some type of encouragement, but he didn’t even look my way.  
Gee thanks, I thought.
My legs started to shake as soon as I stood up, and I prayed that the others couldn’t see how nervous I was.
Bobby stood up and followed me into the closet.
“Now what?” I asked him after we closed the door and sat down. It was so dark inside the closet that I could not even make out his face. From his heavy breathing, however, I knew he was close.
“What do you wanna do?” he asked, sounding almost as if he was out of breath.
“Umm…. err, we could talk?” I said rather quickly. “So, what's your favorite color?”
I could feel Bobby shifting a little closer to me.
“Or, we could do this,” he whispered as he felt around in the dark for my face.
I held my breath as he moved closer.
When his hands finally found my face, he traced a delicate line from my nose to my mouth.
I swallowed nervously. I could feel his warm breath on my skin as his lips gently touched mine. They felt nice and soft. He opened his mouth slightly and slid his tongue into mine.
My stomach tingled with excitement and I shivered.
It felt so good and so wrong at the same time.  I barely knew this boy, and here I was letting him stick his tongue into my mouth.  
Bobby must have felt me tense up. “Relax,” he said softly.
I took a few deep breaths and we continued our kiss. His hands were on my lower back massaging me in a way that I have never felt before, and soon I was like putty under his fingertips.  Then, his hands moved to my waist and I could feel his fingers slowly making their way north. When he cupped my left breast with his hand, I quickly pushed him away.
“Too fast,” I said breathlessly.
Just then someone knocked on the closet door.
“Time’s up, lovebirds!” another kid shouted in the background.
I opened the door and stepped out. The light from the basement seemed as bright as the sun, compared to the blackness in the closet.  I quickly took my seat and could tell that I was at least thirty shades of red. Even the tips of my ears felt like they were on fire.
Bobby, on the other hand, was giving high-fives to all his buddies, making gestures about my breasts, and smiling lecherously.
What a jackass!
That night was the end of my short time crush on Bobby.
As the memory faded, Kelly managed to peel herself off of Wade and then come running back to me.
“Sorry, girl,” said Kelly, as she tried smoothing down her tangled mess of hair. “Wade can be such an animal.”
“Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. Let’s just get to the park, you little vixen,” I said, playfully nudging her.
When we finally made it there, we sat down at a picnic table and I noticed right away that the place was dead, which was odd because it was such a beautiful day. Normally the place was jam-packed.
 I pulled out my cell phone to see if Tyler had called and noticed that it was two-forty-five. I knew we only had a little bit of time before the younger kids got out of school and we’d be bombarded by them.
“Spill it.”
“I had a talk with Tyler yesterday,” I began cautiously, “and he dropped quite the bomb on me.”
“What bomb?”
I looked at Kelly, and for the first time, had second thoughts of confiding in her. Tyler had been very clear that I was to tell no one, but… surely he could not have meant Kelly?  He knew she was my best girlfriend, and my go-to gal, whenever I needed her.  She’d been the only other person in my life, since meeting Tyler, who knew me better than my parents.
I looked at Kelly, my best friend, and just knew that I could trust her. We had been through so much together. She always had my back.
“Tyler called me yesterday, and told me to meet him here,” I said, motioning to the park. “We then took a drive and Tyler told me that he killed his parents.”
“What the hell are you talking about?” Kelly shrieked. “That is not even funny! Not even a little bit!”
Then she started to get up to leave.  I pleaded with her to sit back down.
“Kelly, I really believe him. You didn’t see how serious and frightened he looked when he told me,” I explained. “I thought he was kidding at first, too.”
Kelly sat back down. I could see she was trying to digest this huge bombshell I’d just dropped on her. “Where is he now?” she asked, sounding a little worn out.
“I don't know,” I answered honestly. “He told me his life was in danger, and that he had to leave town. He was also worried that somehow I would be hurt if someone saw him talking to me.”	
“Danger? Leave town?” she sputtered. “What exactly did Tyler get himself into?”
“I don't know, Kelly. I went by his place yesterday, expecting to see cops surrounding the place, but it was quiet, no one seemed to even be home.”
“Well,” she said, sounding relieved. “That's a good thing. If Tyler really had killed his parents, the cops would be crawling all over his place.”
I smiled. That’s what I loved about her. She always pointed out the obvious and knew how to calm me down.  She was confirming exactly what I wanted to believe. “Yeah, I kind of thought the same thing, too,” I answered, also feeling relieved. “Let's go over to his place right now. I think his mom's shift at the bakery ends at two p.m., so she should be home, by now.”
She agreed and we walked the short distance to Tyler's house.  Just as I had expected, it looked the same as it did yesterday. No cops prowling around, no detective-looking guys combing the area for prints or suspects.
It looked like it always had – normal.
Kelly and I went up to the front steps and noticed that their morning paper was still outside of the front door.  I picked it up and knocked on the door, but nobody answered.  I rang the doorbell; again no, answer.  Then I realized that I still knew their garage code.
I jogged over to the garage and quickly punched in the four-digit code.  The door started to open and my heart dropped when I noticed that their parents’ car, the only one they owned, besides Tyler’s, was parked inside.  When the garage door opened fully, Kelly and I exchanged the same freaked-out expression.
“We gotta get into the house,” Kelly insisted, her eyes filled with fear. “What if they’re inside, hurt, and needing our help?”
I had a really bad feeling about this, and my hands began to tremble. Although, I really did not want to break into their house, I knew Kelly was right and we had to see what was really going on.
“I know a way we can get in,” I said, sighing. “Follow me.”  
Tyler had once shown me where they hid their spare key.  He had a habit of losing his and his parents had gotten sick of driving home from wherever they were at, just to let him inside. So they’d kept one hidden in the backyard.
I went around the house to the patio and lifted up the lid of the grill. Inside, taped to the lid, was the key. I grabbed it, and motioned for Kelly to follow me. We then unlocked the front door and quietly entered the house.  
I wrinkled my nose. The house had a funky smell to it, but I wasn’t sure exactly what it was.  
“Smells weird,” whispered Kelly.
“I know.”
As we walked into the dining room, we noticed the dinner table - there was still food on it and it definitely wasn’t fresh.
We then glanced down at the plates and noticed enchiladas of some sort. As I peered into the glasses, I saw that they were still filled with milk, but it was now thick and obviously stale.
“Rani,” Kelly whispered behind me in a shaky voice. “I am getting really freaked out.”
“I know, me too,” I replied, sounding much calmer than what I actually was. “Let's just finish looking around and then we will get the heck out of here.”
“Okay.”
We walked up the staircase that led to the second floor and noticed that the majority of the pictures on the wall were crooked. Then I saw Tyler's door and immediately felt sick to my stomach. It looked like someone had broken it because it was only hanging on the hinges and there were pieces of broken wood and bolts lying on the carpeting.
“What the hell happened here?” Kelly asked mirroring my question.
Not knowing what else to say, I simply shrugged my shoulders and walked into Tyler's room.
“What a mess,” said Kelly.
Actually, it looked like it usually did - as if a tornado had gone through it.
I walked around the room, not really sure exactly what I was looking for.
“Listen, I’ll check the downstairs and then we are out of here,” Kelly said.
I continued to look around Tyler's room for a few minutes more when I heard Kelly yell from downstairs.
“Oh shit! Oh shit! Oh shit!” she screamed. “Get your ass down here, Chicken!!”
I flew down the stairs, two at a time.
Kelly was standing in the middle of the living room pointing at what looked like two piles of dirt.
I touched my chest. “Jesus, Kelly, you almost gave me a heart attack, it’s just dirt.”
“No, come and take a closer look at this pile of dirt,” she replied shakily.
I walked over and stood beside Kelly, staring down. “Dirt,” I repeated.
“No, Rani, look into the dirt,” she said impatiently.
I got down on my knees to get a better look.  It certainly looked like dirt with some white rocks. Then, something caught my eye. Near the top of one pile were strands of what looked like blonde hair.
The same color hair Tyler's mom had!
I stood up so quickly that I felt a wave of vertigo.
“See, I told you it was more than dirt,” Kelly said matter-of-factly.
I tried to compose myself and once again and got back on my knees.  I carefully touched some of the dirt with my fingertips.
“Oh my God! Are you crazy?” Kelly yelled shrilly. “Don't touch that shit!”
I looked up at her and frowned. “Calm down, Kelly, I just want to get a better look.”
She shuddered. “Fine, just hurry up.”
Looking around, I reached over and grabbed the poker from the fireplace, then started sifting through the dirt. As I examined its contents, I could see what looked like more clumps of blonde hair. Then, I picked up one of the white stones for closer inspection.  
It was a tooth.


Chapter Seven

Phil

I returned to the Jacobsons’ home and could just sense the wave of doom in the air. Somehow, I knew this wasn’t going to go the way I‘d wanted, and it made me sick. The knots in my stomach began to tighten as I thought about what the outcome would be if their son continued to refuse the injection.
Just, get ahold of yourself, man.
Frustrated, I pulled the visor mirror down and looked at my reflection.  What I saw was normal for me but very unsettling at the same time. As usual, I looked… perfect. Every hair was in place, my blue eyes were vibrant and bright, and hell, even my teeth looked like they could be in one of those toothpaste commercials.  
Clenching my jaw, I slammed the visor shut. How could I look that good on the outside, when deep down, I felt like such a monster?

I remembered asking him, when I was a young child, if we were monsters, since we drank blood to survive. His stock answer was always, “No, Phil, we are not monsters, we are blessed.”
Our lineage went to the beginning of time and he’d often tell me of the mortals who’d been the true monsters. Attila the Hun, Maximilien Robespierre, Idi Amin Dada, Vlad the Impaler, Ivan the Terrible, Caligula and Adolf Hitler.
I remember cringing on his lap as he would tell the stories.  
“There was once a Countess named Elizabeth Bathory,” he’d once said. “Now, she had been a true monster.  This woman believed that the blood of young girls would make her youthful. She’d killed over six-hundred-and fifty young girls, using their blood for her baths, smearing their blood on her face. But, alas, she was wrong. Once the people found out what she had done, they locked her alone a room, and she died four years later.  Son, now that is a monster.”
Unfortunately, I still felt like a monster at times.
Sighing, I got out of the car and strode to the front door.  I rang the doorbell and only waited a moment before Mrs. Jacobson opened the door.
She quickly pulled me inside. “He's gone.”  
“Who’s gone?”
She smiled grimly. “Tyler.”
My stomach dropped. “Shit.”
Just then, Mr. Henderson walked down the stairs, looking uneasy. “He took off last night.”
I rubbed my forehead in frustration as he continued.
“I… I… went up to his room, you know, to do what I had to do. But when I reached Tyler's door, it was locked.” He cleared his throat and continued. “He wouldn’t open the door, and I was so angry that I just broke it down.  When I stepped inside, I noticed his window was opened. He must have climbed down the trellis and took off.”
“What do we do now?” Mrs. Henderson asked while nervously rubbing her hands together. “His car was also gone; we spent the entire night searching for him.”
I looked at both Mr. and Mrs. Jacobson and had a gut feeling that they were telling the truth.
“What kind of car does Tyler have?” I asked, pulling out a small notepad.
“It's a gray 2006 Nissan Altima,” Mr. Jacobson answered. “License plate number is MNF384.”
I wrote down the information and thanked them.
“Unfortunately,” I said quietly, “we have unfinished business here.”  
They both looked at me in confusion.
I reached into my back pocket and produced a syringe, one that contained a serum that would destroy an Eternal. The one my father had created.  I quickly grabbed Mrs. Jacobson by the back of her blouse.
“No! No!” shouted her husband as he rushed toward us. “My wife! My beautiful wife!  Please, please… don’t hurt her!”
I raised the syringe and plunged it into his chest.
Horrified, he looked at me, his wife, and then finally to the needle that was protruding from his chest.  Then tears streamed down his cheeks as he fell to his knees.
“Nooooooo!” wailed Mrs. Jacobson. “Please don't die, baby, I love you so much!”
Mr. Jacobson fell to his knees, and within seconds, his body erupted in flames. Then, as quickly as the fire started, it was gone, leaving only a pile of ashes.
Mrs. Jacobson, trembling in terror, turned to me. “Please, Phil,” she begged. “You don't have to do this. I promise, I will find Tyler, and we’ll make sure your secret is safe... I promise!”
I did not want to prolong the agony of this any longer, nor did I want to give her any hope that there could be any other outcome. I had orders, and if I was caught disobeying them, I’d be dead.
Straightening up, I took a deep breath and pulled her toward me.  “I truly am sorry,” I whispered, plunging another syringe into her chest.
She fell to the floor, and within seconds, there were two piles of ashes at my feet.
Sighing, I quickly made an exit. I then drove away from the Jacobsons’ home clasping the steering wheel with shaky hands.  I knew that killing them was the only answer, but it still made me sick to my stomach.  I just hoped as time went on this would become easier.  
Why is this choice so difficult for some of them? I wondered. Who wouldn’t want to stay young and healthy for the rest of their lives?
I thought back to the day when my father had explained to me and the other recruiters of how we were actually doing these people a favor.  We were giving them to chance to live the life most people dreamed of.  
“Sit down,” said my father, Dane Slatter, through tight lips. He was one of only a handful of full-blooded Eternals left in the world. “I don't have all day, and we have a lot of material to cover.”
We quickly grabbed our seats around the conference table.
I looked around - Big John, Steve, and Gina Montgomery. The four of us had been hand-chosen by my father for this special assignment. We were the ones he trusted the most, and knew how important this assignment actually was.
“I know you are all aware that we have finally found success in creating DD8. Now, after several trials, we are finally ready to set the plan into motion.”
We all sat up straighter.
“I have already done the market research in our first test market,” he continued. “Unfortunately, not many people will have the honor of becoming an Eternal.”
“Why not?” Gina interrupted. “Wasn't that the point of DD8? To make as many Eternals as possible to ensure that we would become the majority?”
“NO!” my father barked. “We are not just going to make anyone an Eternal! The Eternals we want to bring into our fold have to fit a certain criteria.” “Here,” he said, giving us each a piece of paper. “These are the pre-qualifying factors that each person must meet:
1.	Individuals must be between fifteen and fifty-five years of age.
2.	Individuals must be financially stable (i.e. two-income homes and must make the minimum of one hundred grand a year.)
3.	Individuals must have a current health form stating that they are in good health
I was well aware of my father's criteria. He told me once that he refused to have any poor, losers or vagrants as Eternals.  His belief was that if someone could prove that they were hard-working and ambitious, they would be the most deserving, and typically the type of individual who would jump at the opportunity to become immortal.  He’d already worked with many CEOs and leaders of various organizations, and had noticed that they’d all shared similar qualities - the need to succeed, regardless of whom they harmed on the rise to the top and greed, even though many had more money than they could spend in a lifetime, they still always wanted more.
“Okay,” my father continued, as he handed each of us a large stack of papers. “What you have there, are the list of the families that you will be visiting. We’re going to start with Hugo, because they are a much newer community. The neighbors will be less likely to get into other people’s business, and we want to be able to visit their homes, without prying eyes watching our every move.”
I stared at the information on my stack of papers. I’d heard of Hugo. It was a small growing community in Minnesota and home to a lot of younger families who tended to earn decent salaries. At least that’s what my father had explained to me.
“Do you really think these people are going to let us into their homes?” Gina asked.
It was a great question, one that I had asked him in the beginning stages of DD8.
“Yes, they will,” he answered, glancing at each one of us. “Once you tell people that by accepting this gift their children will never get sick, old, or feel any pain, ever, their emotions will get the best of them,” he continued, “then their egos will kick in. Just the thought of being immortal, like a god, and,” he snapped his fingers, “bang, we got 'em hooked.”

***

I returned to the Jacobsons’ home later in the day to see if Tyler had returned.  When there was no sign of him, I decided to stake it out, for just a little bit.
I parked several houses down and watched, my stomach growling.
Shit, I should have fed.
I’d been very fortunate growing up that I’d never had to kill anyone myself for food.  My family had been wealthy enough that we’d had other Eternals go out and get our meals for us.  Of course, I’d been well aware of where the blood had come from, but it was easy to push aside the facts when sustenance was always neatly bottled in the fridge and waiting for me.
My stomach growled again.
Although we drink blood to survive, there were some Eternals who liked to compare themselves to vampires, which I thought was totally ridiculous.  
Totally ridiculous.
Most importantly, vampires are not real.  They are fictional creatures. that apparently, and according to the latest craze of vampire movies, now glitter in the sun.   I guess one would say that compared to vampires, Eternals are pretty boring. We don't shimmer in the sun, we can’t move at lightning speed, we don't have super strength, and we certainly can’t turn into bats.  The up side is that the sun does not bother us and holy water can't kill us.  The only thing we have in common with vampires is that we definitely need blood to survive.
And boy can we survive!
Although, admittedly, being an Eternal does come with drawbacks. For one, our bodies stop aging at the age of twenty-five, which sounds good, but can be complicated, especially when everyone else keeps aging around you. My father, who I tell everyone is my brother, and I have actually moved around so much that I have lost track of all the different cities we have lived.  He looks twenty-five on the outside, but he is over two-hundred and fifty years old.  I am only twenty-one, the same age my mother was when she met my dad, so I have four more years before I reach full maturity.
I thought about my mother and wondered if my father would ever share more information about her with me. Although she’d been human, he had fallen head-over-heels for her. Knowing it would never work, he’d tried denying the feelings he’d had, but it had been too late. Before he could break it off, she’d become pregnant and he’d ended up marrying her. Sadly, she died in childbirth and I’m not sure what went wrong, as my father refuses to talk about it. I still carry an old worn picture of her in my wallet, however. Many days I’d pull it out and stare at it for hours, wondering what would have happened if she’d have survived.
Pushing my mother and blood out of my mind, I played Candy Squash on my phone. It was such a dumb-ass game, but it was so damn addicting.  Just when I was about to pass a level I’d been stuck on, I saw a young blonde girl knocking on the Jacobsons’ door.  I stopped playing and watched her.
She waited for a few minutes at the doorway, and then ran off when nobody answered.
I tried to follow her with my car, but she zig-zagged through a couple of homes, and I lost her.
Who was that?  Maybe a girlfriend?
I went back to the house, waited around for another hour, and then left, calling it a day. I needed blood and if I waited too long, my mood would only get worse.
The next day, I went back to Tyler’s home in the early morning, but there was still no sign of him.  I played a little more Candy Squash, eventually throwing my phone against the windshield when I couldn’t get past the next level.
Damn game.
I sat in the car, listening to the sounds of the neighborhood, birds singing, a lone dog in the distance barking, and the occasional car that would pass me by. I thought it was a decent place to live, one you’d see in a typical new subdivision - perfectly landscaped lawns, two and three-story homes with two or three, stall garages. Unfortunately, I’d never lived in a neighborhood like this.  My father had always insisted on living in condos in the city.  He thought that living in the suburbs would be as much fun as watching paint dry.  
“Son,” he’d say. “I love the city life and the commotion. Something is always happening.”
Not me, though, I thought, stretching my arms. I could get used to living in the suburbs.
I was getting lost in my thoughts, once again, when I saw her again.  The blonde girl had returned, and this time she had a small red-haired girl with her.  I pulled out my pair of binoculars and watched the pair ring the front doorbell.  After a few seconds, the blonde ran off toward the back of the house, followed by the other girl.
What the hell are they up to?
I quickly left my car and quietly made my way near the back of the home, hiding on the other side of a fence. I could hear them talking.
“It should be under here,” one of them said.
I stole a glance and noticed that the blonde had retrieved a key from underneath a grill top.
Must be a girlfriend, or possibly a family member?  How would she know where the family hid their house key?
The two young girls raced back around the house and opened the front door.
I hastily went back to my car and waited to see what would happen next. After about ten minutes or so, the girls walked out.  They had their heads down and seemed to be talking to each other.
Did they see the ashes?  
Of course they did, you dumbass, I thought, mentally kicking myself.  You should have cleaned up your mess.
This time I was determined that I would not lose the blonde.  I followed them at a safe distance until they entered a bakery.  They went inside for a few minutes and then left, apparently without purchasing anything. Then, their next stop was a coffee/bistro.  I parked my car and watched through the windows as they sat down. After a few minutes, I decided to go inside.
When I entered the coffee shop, the smell of newly crushed coffee beans was a delight to my senses.  I‘d always loved the smell of coffee, and it was times like this that I wished I could drink the delectable smelling concoction.
I thought back to when I was six years old. “Dad,” I’d called out, while a commercial interrupted my favorite television show. “Can we please, please, please go to McDonald's?” I’d wanted to try the chicken nuggets that were on T.V. “Those kids look happy when they eat those chicken things.”
“Son,” my father had replied. “You and I have gone over this a hundred times…”
I’d stomped my foot. “I know, but it is not fair! I want a McNugget!!”
“If you eat that food, Phil, you will get sick.”
“I will not!” I’d argued.
He’d smirked. “Fine, let's go.”
When he’d pulled into the McDonald's drive thru, I’d still been shocked that he’d brought me there. My father was usually a very stubborn man.
“One kid’s meal with nuggets,” my dad said loudly into a menu of food.
“No, Dad!  MCNUGGETS!” I yelled, worried that I would get the wrong order and not look like one of those happy kids I’d seen on television.
“McNuggets,” repeated my father, sounding a little annoyed.
Unfortunately, he made me wait until we got home before I could dig into that deliciously smelling cardboard box that had a big yellow smile on it.  
We took the elevator up to the penthouse level where our condo was located and I was practically bouncing on the walls of the elevator, willing it to move faster.
“Go to the table.”
I ran and took a seat.  He handed me the box and I tore it open.  Inside was a smaller box.  I opened it and took one out, examining the nugget.  It was light brown, and had a weird shape to it.  I shoved it into my mouth, expecting to be amazed, but… there was nothing.
I could taste nothing.
I could feel the chicken moving around in my mouth as I chewed, but there was no taste whatsoever. 
I quickly grabbed another one and it was the same thing.
Hmm? I thought, Maybe they were bad?
I grabbed a few French fries, hoping they’d be different but…. nope. 
Sadly, I looked at my Happy Meal box and was pretty pissed off that I was not smiling like the kids I’d seen on the television commercial. 
I’d spent the rest of the evening in the bathroom, throwing up. He’d obviously been telling the truth about human food and I’d never attempted it again.
“How many?” the elderly woman asked at the front register.
“Ah, um… one please,” I replied, a little distracted.
“Here you go, hun,” she said, handing me a menu. “The special is tuna-and-rye with tomato soup.”
“Thank you.” I smiled and looked up at her. Unsurprisingly, she reacted to me as most females did.  I could already see the faint blush creeping up to her cheeks.
“My pleasure, hun. Your waitress will be right with you.”
“Okay.”
I watched her walk away, and then focused my attention to the reason why I was here.  The blonde and red-head were only a few tables, away.  I could tell they were having a deep conversation, but, unfortunately, I was not close enough to hear what they were saying.
When the waitress came by, I ordered a black coffee. Just because I couldn't drink it, didn't mean I couldn't enjoy the aroma.



Chapter Eight

		
			
Rani

“Who do you think this belongs to?” I asked, pulling the tooth out of my pocket.
“Oh my God, Rani! Put that nasty thing away,” Kelly said with a look of disgust. “I plan on eating at this table.”
I looked at it one more time and then slipped it back into my pocket.
“I just want to forget what we thought we saw,” Kelly said, looking nervously around the café. “What if Tyler was telling the truth? There could be people looking for us right now.”
I sighed. “You’re being paranoid. I’m sure there is a logical explanation for all of this.”
“The hell I am. I’ve seen movies like this before, and it’s always the people who are trying to be helpful that end up being slashed into itty bitty pieces.”
I laughed out loud.  Kelly had quite the imagination and her stories usually ended up with someone ending up in itty bitty pieces.
“Fine, we can talk about this later,” I conceded. “Let's order something to eat. I am starving.”
The waitress came by; we both ordered iced coffees and a tuna sandwich, to share. They had the best food in town and my mouth watered as I thought about sinking my teeth into the sandwich.
As I handed the waitress my menu and looked around the café, I noticed him.  He was by far the hottest man I’d ever seen, with blonde hair pulled into a ponytail and the bluest of eyes.  His lips were a pale pink and looked totally kissable.
“Earth to Rani,” Kelly said, snapping her fingers in my face, ruining the moment of where I was just about to undress him with my eyes.
“What are you staring at?” she asked, looking over her shoulder. Then, she must have spotted what had me damn near in a trance.
“Whoa!” she said, turning back to me. She giggled. “Mama likes.”
I feigned innocence. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
Her eyes widened. “Bullshit! That man over there is the hottest piece of man meat that has ever graced this town. Don't pretend for one minute that you didn’t notice him. I ain’t that stupid.”
I snorted.
“Here you go, ladies,” said the waitress, putting our tuna fish sandwich on the table. She handed us two plates. “You need anything else?”
“No, thank you,” we both answered in unison.
“Mm…” said Kelly, as she took her first bite. “This taste as good as he looks.”
“You are so wrong,” I said, smiling and shaking my head at her.
We sat in silence and finished the tuna sandwich  
I sat back in the chair, savoring my last bite, and without realizing it, my gaze immediately went to the hot blonde man.  This time, to my surprise, he was looking right back at me.  
He smiled and I could feel the heat rising to my cheeks.  I quickly averted my eyes and tried to focus on Kelly who happened to be staring at me.
Busted!
“For God's sake, girl, just go over there and say hello,” Kelly said impatiently.
“Are you nuts?  He looks like a freakin' movie star,” I whispered.
“You are really living up to your name, Chicken,” Kelly teased and then stood up. “I will be right back,” she said, walking away.
I watched in horror as she approached the blonde-haired stranger.  
What the hell is she up to?
Kelly then took a seat at his table. I could not hear what she was saying to him, but midway through the conversation I saw him look up at me.
OH, MY GOD! I am going to KILL her.  
I slid down lower into my chair, just hoping the ground would swallow me up.  Instead, I found, to my horror, that both of them were heading toward me.
Oh crap… oh crap… oh crap…
“Rani, this is Phil,” Kelly said, smiling at me. “And Phil, this is Rani.”
“Nice to meet you, Rani,” he said, extending his hand.
Oh, my God, his voice sounded just as hot as he looked. Deep and smooth.
“Nice to meet you, Phil,” I replied, shaking his hand. To my surprise, my voice sounded much calmer than I felt. On the inside, I was squealing like a five- year-old who’d just received a pony.
“Here,” Kelly said, pulling out her chair. “Sit down, and keep Rani company for a minute. I have to make a call. Be right back,” she said smiling wickedly at me.
You red-haired little devil, I am so going to get you back.
“So,” Phil began. “Your friend tells me you both are graduating next month. Have you thought about what college you’re going to?”
College? College? Who the hell cares about college?!
The only thing that was on my mind was the fact the hottest man I’d ever seen was talking to me.
“Umm, yeah,” I responded, trying to sound normal “I am going to the U of M.”
“That's a great school,” he said, giving me a killer smile that almost made me melt right there and then. 
I nodded. “Yeah, my parents are pretty happy that I was accepted. So, do you go to college?” I asked, interested in learning everything about him. Every time he smiled at me, my pulse shot up and I had to stop myself from gaping.
“I graduated last year,” he answered.
I took a sip of my iced-coffee. “So that means you are out in the real world, huh?”
“Yep, and let me tell you…  it's not at all what it’s cracked up to be,” he said through a soft laugh.
Just then, Kelly came back to the table.
“Well,” Phil said standing up. “I should be on my way.”

Oh crap, please don't go!  
I was surprised that this man had provoked such a feeling of desire in me.  I‘d never met anyone like him, and it sucked that just as quickly as he’d entered my life, he’d be gone.
“Rani,” said Phil, looking at me. “If it’s not too forward, I would love to get your number and get the chance to see you again.”
Um… yeah!  You can have my number and whatever else you want!
“That would be nice,” I answered and then wrote down my number on a napkin.
He grabbed it and put in his pocket. “Great to meet you both,” he said. “And Rani, I will call you soon.”
“Sounds great, nice meeting you, too,” I said, smiling.
We both watched as he walked away.
“Now that, my friend, is what you call a nice ass!” Kelly said in husky voice.
I gave her a light punch on the arm as we grabbed our stuff to leave.
She elbowed me in the side. “Hey, you’re welcome!”  
I just shook my head.
The next few days I felt like I was in limbo. Not only had I not heard from Tyler, but Phil never called, either. I kept looking at my phone every five minutes to see if I’d missed his call, but there was nothing. It had been too good to be true.
Why would a man like him even be interested in me?  
I figured that he thought I was just a kid, one who was still in high school. It was kind of how I felt anyway - a silly girl with a crush.
About a week later, I decided to go out for a walk. It was finally beginning to feel like spring, even though it was already the end of May. My thoughts drifted to Tyler and his disappearance. I wondered where he was and if he was okay. I was confused and more than a little hurt that he hadn't bothered to call and explain what was really happening. Kelly and I had both decided that we were not going to tell anyone about the dirt and teeth we’d found, even though it had totally freaked us out. We weren't sure what it was all about, and we didn’t want to get into trouble for sneaking into Tyler’s house.
On my way home, I felt my back pocket buzz. I pulled out my phone and looked at the caller I.D. Unknown.
“Hello?”
“Hi, is this Rani?”
I knew immediately who it was; I would remember his voice forever. “Yes, it is.”
“Hi, it's Phil, remember me?”
Remember you? No not at all… you’re just the only thing I have thought about since the day at the coffee shop. “Of course I do. How are you?”
“Good, I was wondering if you’d like to get together tomorrow night? Maybe dinner and a movie?”
YES, YES, YES!!!! How about now??
“Sure, sounds good,” I said, trying to sound as nonchalant as possible. 
“Would you like me to pick you up?”
It was then that I remembered - I had to meet with my guidance counselor tomorrow after school and wasn’t sure how long it would last. “Why don't we meet at Les Mexicano's at six o’clock? Does that work for you?” I asked hopefully
He paused. “It sure does.”
I smiled. “Great!”
“Okay then, I’ll see you tomorrow, Rani.”
“Great, see you then.”
“Bye.”
I slid the phone back into my pocket and practically skipped home, I was just so excited.
The next day at school seemed to drag on and on.  The only thing I could think about was seeing Phil.  Visions of his smile and those blue eyes flashed through my head all day, giving me butterflies.
Later that afternoon, the meeting with my counselor went much longer than anticipated. As Mrs. Sloan spoke, I watched as the clock tick closer to five.
“Rani?” she repeated, snapping me back into reality. “Do you have any questions for me?”
“Nope,” I answered, just wanting to get out of there.
She handed me a brochure of classes that I needed to take during my first year at the U. of M. “Alright,” she said, “looks we are done here then.”
“Thank you so much for your help, Mrs. Sloan, I really do appreciate it,” I said, tucking the brochure into my backpack.
“You’re welcome. Good luck next fall.”
“Thanks.”
I left her office and drove home quickly.  Fortunately, my parents had let me take their car, knowing I had an appointment with Mrs. Sloan.
“Hey, sweetie,” my mom called out from the kitchen as I walked in the door. “How was your day?”
“It was good,” I answered, running up the stairs.
I was brushing out my hair when she knocked on the door.
“Hey, you took off so quickly,” she said. “What’s the rush?”
I had not told my parents about the date with Phil, They’d have asked me a million questions that would have exhausted me. What's his name? What do his parents do? Is he a good student? Where did you meet him? What are you doing? When will you be home? Is he a safe driver?
“Um, I promised Kelly I would go over and help her with a composition paper that’s due on Monday,” I lied. As much as I hated lying to her, sometimes it was just easier than having to with the assault of questions she’d hurl at me.
“That is so nice of you,” she said, smiling at me “You are such a good friend.”
My insides did a flip-flop from the guilt. I really hated not telling her the truth. “Thanks, Mom,” I replied as I finished my hair. “Is it OK if I use the car again?” I asked. “I am not sure how long I’ll be at Kelly's”
“Sure, your dad and I were just going to hang around the house tonight.”
“Thank you,” I said and went over and gave her a kiss on the cheek.
She went back downstairs as I finished getting ready.  
What the hell was I going to wear?
I wanted to wear something that was cute, but not like I was trying too hard. In the end, I decided on a pair of skinny jeans, with cute new wedges that I’d just purchased. I added a simple black shirt and threw on a silver necklace.  Checking out my reflection in the mirror, I smiled. Hmmm, I looked pretty good.
I left my room and ran downstairs, calling out, “Bye, Mom,” as I got to the front door. “See you later.”
“Goodbye!”
Crap, I was going to be late, I thought, glancing at the clock on the dashboard.
Five minutes to six.  
I pushed down a little harder on the accelerator and prayed that there were no cops behind me.  
When I got to the restaurant, I quickly found a parking spot, pulled down the visor, and swiped on a fresh coat of lip gloss, while making sure that my hair was smooth and in place.  Then, I quickly got out of the car and entered the restaurant.  
As I stepped inside, I looked around in the waiting area, but did not see him anywhere.  I started thinking that maybe he’d left already, thinking that I had stood him up, since it was past six.  But, to my delight, I saw him at a nearby booth waving me over.  Smiling, I walked towards him.
Oh, my God, he looks even hotter than I remember.
“I hope you don't mind,” he said, standing up to greet me. “I grabbed us a booth already.”
“Not at all,” I answered, unable to quit grinning.
We both sat back down and immediately I felt the heat rising deep inside of my belly.  My body had never physically responded like that to anyone, and it took me by surprise.
“I hope you like Mexican food,” I said, looking over the menu. “I probably should have asked you, yesterday, when I recommended this place.”
“I love it,” he replied, smiling at me. “It’s one of my favorites.”
The waitress came over and took our order. I asked for the chicken taco salad, but to my surprise Phil did not order anything.
“I thought you said you liked Mexican food?” I asked, frowning.
“I do, I do.” he said reassuringly. “But, I totally forgot that I’d had a dentist appointment early tomorrow. They want me to fast, just in case they have to put me under. Root canal.”
“Ohhhh, ouch,” I grimaced. “No fun. Well, I’m going to feel bad eating in front of you.”
“No worries,” he replied. “I had a big lunch that filled me up.”
“Well, that’s good.” He definitely had a way of making me feel at ease, which I found very comforting.
“So, Phil,” I asked, grabbing a chip from the basket the waitress had brought to the table. “What do you do for a living?”
“Right now, I work with my dad at his research facility.”
“What kind of research do you do there?” I asked, interested in learning everything I could about the man.
“Well,” he said sheepishly. “What I do is kind of boring. I just write codes for their software.”
Writes codes?  He is hot and smart!  Ding, Ding, Ding, looks like we have a winner, folks! “That is not boring at all!”
He smiled.
When my food arrived, I felt a little weird eating in front of him, but Phil reassured me several times that he was perfectly fine. Then, as I picked at my food, we had a casual conversation and I could feel myself growing more and more attracted to him with every passing minute.
“What about your family?” I asked, completely enthralled by him.
He explained that his mother had passed away during childbirth, and that he had a condo in a building that his father owned, in Minneapolis.
After we finished dinner, or at least when I finished dinner, we decided to hit the local theater to check out what movies were playing.
“Let's take my car,” he insisted as we walked out to the parking lot. “I can bring you back here once the movie is finished.”
I agreed and then followed him through the parking lot until he stopped at his car. It was a sleek, black Audi Spyder.  
Wow, even his car was hot! I thought, admiring it.
I didn't know much about cars, but I could certainly tell that this one was not cheap.
He opened the doors and we both slid in.
I sighed in approval as my butt hit the leather. It had to have been the softest I’d ever felt.  
“Any particular movie you want to see?”  I asked Phil while catching a look at his profile.  That man does not have a bad angle.
“Nope,” he replied, smiling at me. Ladies choice.”
His grin sent a shiver down my spine.  What I wanted to do was stop the car and hop onto his lap, the exact same way that Kelly had done to Wade.  I envisioned his lips on mine, and his hands all over my body.  
I groaned inwardly. Oh great, now I am a nympho. One date and I was ready to turn in my V card.
Although I had not intended on being a virgin this long, I’d wanted to wait until I was truly in love, which was unlike most of my girlfriends. The majority of them had done the deed, just to get it over with, saying they did not want to enter college a virgin.  I normally couldn’t have cared less about being a one, but there was something about Phil that stirred something deep inside of me.
When we arrived at the theater, I picked out a Matt Damon movie, figuring it would have both action and romance. There was no need to punish the guy with a total chick flick.
As we walked by the concession stand, he offered to buy me popcorn and soda, but I declined. I wasn’t about to torture him into watching me eat, when he had to have been starving.
We found a seat in the back; the lights went down and the movie started.  I noticed that we were both sharing the same armrest, and soon I could feel the heat radiating between us.  
Did he feel it, too?
To my surprise, he reached over and grabbed my hand, placing it inside of his.
I tried watching the movie, but all I could really think about was my hand in his. It felt so small in his large, soft one and after a while, I began to wonder how it would feel on my breasts. Then, before I knew, the credits rolled and they turned on the lights.
“That was really good,” said Phil, looking over at me. “Did you like it?”
“I loved it,” I lied. I really had not been paying attention to the movie.
“Good.”
When drove back to the restaurant, I was bummed that his car was a manual transmission, making it impossible for us to hold hands again.  I saw the sign of the restaurant and was even more disappointed that our evening had come to an end.  I pointed out my car in the lot and he parked next to it.
“So, here we are,” he said, stopping next to mine.
“Yep, here we are,” I answered back, surprised by the sultry tone in my voice.
Phil reached over and gently guided my face toward his. First, he gave me a soft kiss and I noticed that his lips were even softer than they’d looked.  Soon, his kiss deepened, becoming more demanding, which made my nipples instantly harden.  He reached up with his hands and ran his fingers through my hair.
“Oh, my God, Rani” he whispered breathlessly in my ear. “You are so sexy.”
No one had ever told me that I was sexy before, and I loved hearing it from Phil.
He began kissing my neck and ears, making my insides feel wobbly, like Jell-O. With each kiss, I could feel small electrical charges shoot through my system, all landing directly in the junction between my legs.
We gradually pulled away from each other, needing to catch our breaths.
“I want to see you again,” he said huskily.
Still breathless, I just nodded my head.
Smiling, he gave me another kiss and told me that he’d call me tomorrow, after his dentist appointment.
“Okay,” I replied, although I was dreading the thought of leaving him.  I just wanted to stay with him all night.

 
Chapter Nine

Phil

I knew the minute our eyes met, that I was done for.  Besides forgetting all about Tyler, I was swept away by her beauty and innocence. It caught me totally off guard.
Rani…
Long blonde hair, beautiful green eyes, and legs that seemed to go on forever.  I had never been nervous around a human female before, but this one was different and I actually felt like a tongue-tied fool in her presence.
The night we had our first date, she was late, and I’d been terrified that she’d stood me up.  But then I saw her, standing in the entryway.  As she’d approached the table, I could not help but feel an immediate rush of desire for such an attractive girl. Her blonde hair had been soft and flowing, her jeans had looked like they’d been painted on, emphasizing her shapely her legs, and the black T-shirt had been tight enough that I could make out the outline of her round, firm breasts. I actually had to stop myself from drooling every time I stared at her.
When the waitress came, I’d already thought of the “dentist excuse” prior to dinner. The truth was, I had normally only dated other Eternals, because it was just easier than trying to come up with one-hundred-and-one different excuses as to why I couldn’t eat or drink anything.
Well, except for blood, that is…
Sitting across from Rani, it took every ounce of willpower not to reach over the table and kiss her while she picked at her food.  She seemed a little uneasy about eating in front of me, and I decided that if we had another date, we would do something that did not involve eating.
At the movies I decided to test the waters to see if she was into me.  I grabbed her hand, placing it into mine; she did not pull it away, so that was a good sign.
Driving back to the restaurant, all I could think about was how much I wanted to kiss her, and it was hard to focus on driving when I could feel the hardness growing inside of my jeans.  
Once we pulled into the parking spot next to her car, I decided to take the initiative and just go for it.  I reached over and grabbed her face with my hands and pulled her to me.  
After the first kiss, I knew I was a goner…  
She awoke something deep inside of me, something… primal.  
When I covered her lips with mine, I noticed that her skin seemed smoother than anything I’d felt before, and I wanted to take her right there and then. I eventually forced myself to back off, knowing that it was dangerous to keep kissing her when I was as hard as a rock, and not thinking clearly.
We made a date for the following day, and by the time I got home, I had to take a cold shower to settle myself down.
I woke up the following morning, and Rani was the first thing that I thought of; I was so eager to see her again. Unfortunately, our date was for later in the day and I still had a meeting with my father - it was time to check in and let him know how the recruiting was going. I decided to not tell him about the Jacobsons yet, and wasn’t even sure if I ever would.  I definitely did not want to deal with the ass reaming that would surely accompany my major fuck up.
I got dressed and took the elevator up a few floors to his place, grateful that we lived in the same building.
“Come in,” my father called out.
I entered his apartment and as always was blown away. Not only was his place bigger, but he had grandeur tastes and had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars furnishing it.  
I went into the refrigerator and grabbed a fresh jar of blood.  I poured myself a glass and my mouth began to water in anticipation. With all of the excitement of yesterday, I’d forgotten to feed.  
I closed my eyes and drank. The first sip was always the best. I loved the feeling of the thick liquid on my tongue, slowly going down my throat.  To me, the coppery bitterness was like heaven.
Just then my dad entered the kitchen and directed me into the dining room.
I finished my breakfast quickly, set the empty glass on the table, and followed him to the table.
“So, how is it going out there?  Do you have any news for me?”  
My stomach quickly dropped. Shit… does he already know about the Jacobsons? No, I am just being paranoid; there is no way he could. Not this soon.
I swallowed hard and pulled out the list of names from my back pocket.
“I have met with these families,” I said, pointing out the names on the list, “and all of them were successfully recruited and now are members of the Eternal family.”
My father glanced at the list and then flicked it back over to me.  “We need more,” he said. “You know you have a deadline, son, you need visit at least fifteen homes a day.” He shook his head in disappointment. “At this rate, it will take you three months to finish.”
“Don't worry, Dad, I will get it done.”
“Tell me how the people are reacting when you approach them.”
Every family I’d met, so far, excluding the Jacobsons, had gone pretty smooth.  Typically, I’d show them the video, explaining how they can live forever and never age or get sick.  The questions I’d received in return were mostly from middle-aged women asking if they could be younger.  Unfortunately, they can’t. Once they pass the age of maturity, they stay the same age as when they’ve turned. Most accept it, but I remember one lady, Rebecca Conolly, raising her hands in exasperation and asking me where I was twenty years ago.  
Although most people were a little put off by having to consume blood to stay alive, once I explained the nutrients inside and how their palate will change once they turn, they usually accepted it.  

“Their reactions are really positive, Dad, I had no idea so many people would agree so quickly,” I answered honestly.
“I told you they would, son. Don't ever doubt your old man.”
I laughed in spite of myself. My father describing himself as an old man was comical, considering he looked to be the same age as me. “I never do.”
Although, that was actually a lie.
I had doubted him when he’d originally revealed the plan to have the Eternals take over the world and become the dominant race.  I’d laughed at him, thinking he was being foolish when we were just a small minority of people. In fact, there had been only a few hundred full-blooded Eternals left in the world - most of them had moved away from the pack-style of living, going off on their own and not reproducing very many full-blooded newborns. This had aggravated my father.
“If we can perfect the serum,” he’d said a couple of years ago. “We will be able to ensure that our bloodline never disappears. Mark my words… over time we will prevail, and become the majority.”
My father had always despised hiding his true nature as well as having to move from town to town for centuries.
It was then that he sat me down and explained in detail what our mission was.  He and other elder Eternals around the globe were going to choose individuals who fit their criteria to become Eternals.   He knew after the amount of time he’d spent with people, they’d jump at the opportunity to become immortal.
“But, Dad, how can we expect them to survive?” I’d argued. “Do you really think they will be able to look at their own kind now as a meal?”  
He’d waved his hand. “Listen, I have been around a lot longer than you, lad, I know exactly what they are capable of doing.  Many of them would turn on their own family members to obtain the gift of eternal life.”
“You think so?” I’d asked in shock.
“Son, man's greatest fear is death,” he’d continued. “They hate that they have no control over aging and dying. Hell, look at the television. All you see are poor schlubs trying anything to stay young.  Men and women alike… going to doctors to have their faces pulled every which way, lips plumped up to appear more youthful, and,” he’d laughed. “Implants for their tits so they don't sag anymore. So you see - greed and vanity are their weakness, and we are the answer that they have been searching for; the fact that they may have to make a meal of their neighbor is just a minor bump in the road for them.”
Unfortunately, what he’d said was the truth. I, myself, had witnessed the ugly side of humans also.
“I want better for you, my son,” he’d went on. “I want you to be able to stay in one home for more than ten years. I want you to have a normal life and be proud of who you are. To never have to hide your true self, and if we are successful in our plan, you’ll never have to.”
“Dad,” I’d replied. “Why don't we just come out into the open, and tell people what we are? You might be surprised; maybe the people would be accepting?  The world is a much more tolerant place than it was years ago.”
His eyes had widened. “Are you kidding me? The government would hunt us down and rip us open to see what makes us tick. Do you want to live the rest of your life being someone's science project?”
I had to agree with him there, too. Although the world was evolving and changing, it certainly was not ready to accept a different humanoid species. There were still countries that turned their noses up at inter-racial and same-sex couples. If they couldn’t tolerate what they perceived as “abnormal” behavior with their own kind, there was no way they were ready to accept us.
My father and I finished our brief meeting about Hugo, and I headed back to my own apartment to shower and shave.  I was excited to spend the day with Rani.

 

Chapter Ten

Phil

“I am so glad we decided to go to the beach today,” Rani said, putting on her sunglasses.
We’d been seeing each other every day for the past two weeks, and it had been glorious.  I already felt like I’d known her a lifetime. During the day, she was constantly on my mind, and at night, her lovely face found its way into my dreams.
“I don't know if it’s warm enough to swim in,” I said, dipping my toe into the cool water.
Outside the temperature was close to eighty degrees, which was rare for the beginning of June in Minnesota.
“I don't care if we swim at all,” she said, smiling at me. “I am just happy to be here with you.” She bent forward and gave a quick kiss on the lips.
“Same here.”
I watched as she stood up, unbuttoned the top button of her shorts, and shimmied out of them. I could feel my mouth salivate as she pulled off her tank top; she must have seen me ogling her body, because she grabbed a towel and covered herself.
“Uh… I’m not sure if I am beach ready yet,” she said, sounding embarrassed.
Was she kidding?  
She had a body that was, in my opinion… perfection.  Her white bikini was stunning - the triangle top just barely contained her ample breasts while her thin waist and long toned legs were accented by the small white bottoms. She looked like a super-model at a film shoot.
“Honey,” I said, reaching toward her. “You couldn't look bad, even if you tried.”
We spread out our towels side-by-side and held hands as we listened to Rani’s iPod, bopping our heads and singing the songs we knew together.  Granted, neither one of us could hold a tune, but we didn't care. We just enjoyed being together.
After a while, Rani rolled over on her side. “Let's go somewhere private,” she said, smiling with a hint of mischief in her eyes.
I stood up right away, not thinking twice about it.  I had been fantasizing about getting her alone all day.
“Follow me,” she said as she headed toward a patch of woods.
I grabbed the blanket and followed her a few hundred feet into the woods, until she came to a stop.  She stood there and licked her lips, beckoning me forward.
My feet could not move fast enough.
When I reached Rani, I pulled her close and noticed that her body was warmed from the sun; it felt deliciously wonderful against my bare chest. I kissed her lips, reveling in her salty sweetness and our tongues intertwined and danced with each other.  It didn’t take long before I could feel the hardness beginning to form in my bathing suit.  I pressed it against her bikini bottom and to my surprise, she starting rubbing back.  
I slowly moved my pelvis up and down, all around her sweet spot. Just knowing that there was only a tiny piece of fabric holding me back from the “promised land”, was almost more than I could take.
She matched each motion with her own, our bodies already in sync with each other. I bent down and pulled down one side of her bikini top and released her prefect breast.  Her beautiful pink nipple was hard and she arched her back, just begging me to take it.
I bent down and licked the top of her nipple and felt her shiver in my arms.  I opened my mouth wider and began licking and lapping at her supple breast.  
“Lay me down,” she moaned.
My heart began to pound. Over the past couple of weeks, we have had our share of make-out sessions, but none were as hot or as intense as this one.
I quickly spread out the blanket and took her in my arms.  Kissing, we slowly made our way onto the fabric, and then I laid her out in front of me, amazed at the sight before my eyes.“ My God, you are beautiful,” I said, trying to soak up every inch of her body.
I reached down and removed her bikini top, exposing both of her breasts.  They were two beautiful perky mounds with rosebud nipples.  I took one in my hand as I suckled on the other one, and her moans let me know that she liked what I was doing.  My tongue slowly encircled each nipple, teasing, and nibbling as she moaned in my arms.
“I want you so bad,” I whispered into her ear.
“I want you, too,” she replied, her voice hoarse, “but… not here.”
She had already told me that she was a virgin, and I was fine with that.  I loved her, and would wait until forever if that is what it took to be with her.
“We can wait,” I said, “but, for now, let's keep having fun.”
She smiled and pulled me closer.
We began to kiss, again, igniting a fire in both of us. Our passion grew and soon… I could no longer control myself. I reached between her legs and could feel her wetness through the bathing suit. Her legs began to tremble as I slowly began rubbing the fabric of her bikini bottom. I reached in slowly and felt the sticky sweetness on my finger. I began rubbing her clitoris and she began moaning and moving along with my finger, faster and faster my fingers were like the conductor and her sweet spot was my orchestra.
“Phil,” she panted.
Smiling, I slid off her bottoms and started to kiss her inner thigh, with each lick and kiss I would look at her to make sure it was okay; I didn’t want rush her into anything.  
She smiled at me, nudging my face further toward her heat, and with that smile, I tasted heaven for the first time.
Afterwards, we walked back to the beach, hand-in-hand, and then began packing up our supplies we’d brought with. I smiled to myself, thinking of our naughty escapade in the woods and was honored that she wanted to share her precious gift of virginity with me in the future.
“What are you smiling about? You look like the Cheshire cat,” teased Rani.
“Oh, babe, if I told you, you would run right back into those woods with me.”
We both laughed and headed back to my car.
“Hey, Phil,” Rani said, turning down the radio as we left the parking lot.
“I have to tell you something.”
She looked serious, and I instantly became nervous.  Did she not want to see me anymore?  Was I moving too fast?
Trying to sound calm, I answered, “You can tell me anything, honey.”
She looked out the window and back at me nervously. “I think I am falling in love with you.”
I felt my body begin to relax instantly.  She loved me? Did she really just say that?
I pulled my car over to the side of the road.  I wanted to tell her exactly what I felt with no distractions. “I love you, too, Rani.  I think I fell in love with you the first time I laid eyes on you.” I leaned over and gave her a kiss, and to my surprise we both had tears of joy streaming down our cheeks.
 


Chapter Eleven

Kelly

“Mom, where is my new skirt?”
Wade and I had a date in less than an hour, and I could not find it. It was black and short; I just knew that Wade would love it.
“I have no idea,” she yelled back from the living room. “Check in that pigsty you call a closet! I am sure it’s in there somewhere.”
I rolled my eyes. Whatever, it wasn’t that bad.
I opened the closet door and quickly changed my mind.  I guess it could be a little neater.
I started going through the first mound of clothes. No skirt.  
Shit.
“Honey,” she said, nearly scaring the crap out of me.  I swear she was part ninja or part cat.  She had a way of just popping up without a noise.  I hadn’t even known that she’d come into my room.
“Jesus, mom,” I said, slightly irritated. “I’m going to put a bell around your neck, you scared me.”
“You are such a smart ass,” she said, smiling at me.  “Now, before you head out with Wade, we need to have a quick family meeting, downstairs.”
I did a quick mental checklist to see what I was busted for this time, and came up with nothing. Obviously, it had been a pretty slow month for mischief.
“Fine,” I replied, reaching for the second pile of clothes. I quickly started flinging shirts, pants, shorts and bras out of the way. “But how long is it going to take?  Wade and I are supposed to meet at the theater at seven.”
“It will only take a few minutes.” She bent down and grabbed something black. “Is this what you're looking for?” she asked, holding up my skirt.
I grabbed it and gave her a kiss on the cheek. “You're a lifesaver, Mom!”
“Meet us downstairs when you’re done,” she replied, walking out of my room.
“Sure.”
Both of my parents were sitting at the kitchen table with a woman I didn’t recognize when I went downstairs.
Now, who the hell is that?
My dad pointed to a chair. “Sit down, Kelly.”
I did, still staring at the woman.
“Kelly, this is Gina Montgomery,” my father said, nodding in the direction of the woman, “and Gina, this is our daughter, Kelly.”
For the next hour, I listened to Gina tell me something that would change my life forever. Had I known the fate of my future, however, I would have never agreed to it.

 
Chapter Twelve

Rani

I’d been so caught up with Phil and our new relationship, that I felt slightly guilty when I looked at my caller ID and noticed Kelly’s number pop up.  It had been a few weeks since we’d talked, and I couldn’t wait to catch up. I answered the phone and said with smile. “Hey, girl.”
“Hey,” replied Kelly, sounding a little down.
“Are you okay?  You and Wade haven’t broken up again, have you?”
Kelly and Wade have had a roller coaster of a relationship.  Most of the time, they were as sweet as ever, but when she was angry, watch out.  Her fiery hair matched her demeanor and if she was angry with you, her tongue could cut you like a knife.  I always felt lucky to have never been on the other side of her wrath.  Poor Wade, on the other hand, has seen it up close and personal more times than I could count.
“No, no, Wade and I are just fine.  I was just wondering if you wanted to go and grab a tuna sandwich?”
Phil was working and I wanted to see her badly, so I quickly agreed. “You know I am never going to say ‘no’ to a tuna sandwich. What time do you want to meet?
“How about half an hour?”  
“Works for me.”  
“Cool,” she replied. “I’ll see you in a bit.”
I reached the cafe before Kelly did, and grabbed a table toward the back.  The place was sometimes loud and I wanted to make sure we could actually have a conversation.
Kelly walked in, found me immediately, and made a beeline to the table. As she was approaching, I noticed that something was different about her, but I just couldn’t pin-point what it was.
Had she gained weight? Lost weight? New hair color?
We gave each other a quick hug and sat down.
I smiled. “It feels like forever since we’ve hung out.”
“I know, right? So, how are you and Mr. Hotpants doing?” she asked, referring to Phil.  “You cash in your ‘V’ card yet?”
I laughed at her blunt crudeness. “Not yet, you little tramp,” I teased. “But I think it might happen, soon.”
“I have no idea how you could wait this long. I would have had him naked within minutes of our first date. That man is just too yummy.”
She was right, he was yummy and it had been hard not ripping off all of his clothes, especially when we were alone. “Simmer down, Chica,” I teased. “You have your own yummy man.”
We were still laughing with each other, when suddenly, the mood turned serious.   
“What is going on?” I asked, noticing the new troubled look on her face.

She sighed. “Do you remember those piles of dirt that we found at Tyler's house?”
Remember?
Even though I’d been busy with Phil, Tyler and those piles were always at the back of my mind. I still wasn’t sure what had happened to him or his parents, and now, I noticed that their house was up for sale.
“Of course I remember,” I replied. “Why?”
“I found out what really happened and… I’m afraid you are not going to like what I’m about to tell you.”
I felt a little annoyed that Kelly seemed to be holding out the truth on me. “Okay… so what’s with the piles of dirt?”
Kelly looked around the cafe, and then leaned in toward me. “Those weren't piles of dirt. They were the ashes of Tyler's mom and dad, and… the tooth that you found belongs to one of them.”
I gasped in disbelief. “How do you know that?” I asked, a little louder than intended.
She grabbed my wrist. “Rani, I have something to tell you, and it is something that you can never, I mean never, repeat.”
My eyes widened.
“I’m serious,” she whispered. “I am putting my trust and life into your hands by telling you what I’ve found out.”
Life?
I felt a wave of nausea course through my body. It was like Déjà vu - basically the same conversation I’d had with Tyler over a month ago, before he’d disappeared.  If she disappeared, I wasn’t sure if I could handle another friend bailing on me.
“What are you talking about?”
Kelly then unloaded her story onto me and I sat in stunned silence for the next fifteen minutes, listening to every word. She explained that a woman named Gina Montgomery had come into her parents’ home, changing their world completely.
I sat with my mouth hanging open as she finished her tale.
Eternals? Living forever? Drinking blood? Bodies being turned to ashes?  It was too much for me to grasp at one time.
“So, let me get this straight,” I said, trying to remain calm. “Some lady showed you a video of a man dying and then coming back to life. Then, told you a bunch of lies about some magic potion that would make you live forever?
“I know it is hard to believe,” Kelly said quietly. “But, it’s the God’s honest truth, I swear.”
I stared at her in horror. “And you actually let someone inject you with something?”
Kelly nodded.
“For fuck’s sake, Kelly, she could have injected you with some kind of freakin' horse sperm or something!  You don't have any idea what that stuff was she put into your body!”
Kelly looked a little amused at the horse semen comment. “No. I knew what it was and I know that it worked.”
“How in the hell do you know if it worked?” I asked incredulously. “And how do you know that the dirt at Tyler's house was really his parents’ ashes?”
“Gina told me that Eternals who don't follow the rules are killed. Once they die, their bodies turn to ash.”
“Wait a minute, wait a minute,” I interrupted. “I thought you said that these Eternals never die?”
“There is a serum that was also created that can be used to kill them. If they drink or if it gets in their bloodstream, they will die.”
“So you are telling me that the Jacobsons were these Eternal things?”
Kelly shrugged her shoulders. “I don't know for sure, but it makes sense.”
“OK, so how do you know for sure that you are one of them, now?” I challenged her.
Kelly swiftly stood up. “Let’s go,” she said, heading toward the front door.  
I stood up and followed her. Once outside I asked where we were going.
“No more questions for now,” she replied, as she remotely unlocked her car.
We drove a short distance to an old swimming hole that had been closed since last summer. A bunch of little kids had ended up with chigger bites, and they’d never reopened it. Kelly parked the car and I followed her onto an old rickety dock that creaked with every step.
“What the hell, Kelly? Why did you bring me here?”  
In answer, Kelly started taking off her shorts and T-shirt.
“Are you crazy?” I hollered. “You can't go in there, the water is nasty!”
Standing in her bra and panties, she turned to me. “I have to prove that I am telling you the truth.”
“Fine, fine, fine” I said quickly. “I believe you, just get dressed and let's get outta here.” I then turned and began walking away when I heard a splash in the water.
Kelly had jumped in!
Shocked, I ran to the end of the dock trying to see where she went, because she hadn’t come back up.  I got down on my belly to try and get a good look in the water, but it was so full of algae that I could not see a damn thing.  
Dammit, Kelly! Your crazy stunt is the last thing I need right now.
I knew that she was a good swimmer so I sat up and counted to sixty, watching for her head to pop out of the water. But, sixty came and went, and there was no sign of Kelly.
Oh, my God!  Where is she?
Crap!
Okay, calm down…
I counted to sixty again in my head as my hands began to shake. I was so frightened that something had gone terribly wrong, and Kelly was in real danger.  
“Kelly!” I screamed.
Still nothing.
I could not wait any longer; she had been in the water too long.  I kicked off my shoes and jumped into the nasty, green chigger-filled lake.
ARRRGGGHHH!!!
The water was so cold that it felt like a million pins poking me all at once. The algae from the lake was already clinging to my skin and clothes.
Gross!  I am seriously going to kick her ass when I find her!
I inhaled deeply, held my breath, and submerged myself underneath the water.  It was at the most, four feet deep, but so murky that it made it impossible to see anything.
I came up for air and dove back down again, for the second time.  I opened my eyes, but the algae made it impossible for me to see more than two inches in front of my face.
Dammit, she has to be here somewhere.  
I swam a little further out, and still could not find her.
By my third attempt, I was becoming increasingly tired.  With a deep breath, I took another pass by the dock, and I was just about to come up for air, when I felt something grab my foot. I opened my mouth to scream, and instantly I was choking on nasty lake water.  I sputtered and kicked to the top.  
What the hell was that?  
I figured it had to be Kelly playing a stupid trick on me.
Forget her! I am going back up to the dock.
I pulled myself back up onto the dock and waited for her to resurface.  From where I stood, I had a bird’s-eye view of the lake, and would be able to see her when she came up.
I grabbed my phone and checked the time. I figured that I would give her another minute before I left without her; I was starting to get cold and stunk like nasty ass lake water.
The water was calm, and I did not see any ripples of movement. I grabbed my phone once again and to my surprise, three minutes had passed.  
Maybe she wasn't joking and she really needed my help? I figured that if she was just goofing around, she would have already surfaced. Besides, there was no way anyone could stay under that long.
Frightened, I jumped back into the water and quickly swam to the spot where I thought I felt something grab my leg.  I went underwater a little further until I bumped into something soft.  
Kelly!
I opened my eyes, and to my surprise, I could make out her face and she was smiling at me.  Looking closer, I noticed that she was holding onto some kind of seaweed.
I scowled and jerked my thumb upwards.
Kelly looked at me and shook her head.
WTF, Kelly!?
I was running out of air and had to resurface. My body was now shaking from both the cold and the fear I felt.
How in the hell is she doing that?
I took another breath and swam back down to her.  She was in the same spot, just as calm as could be, smiling and waving.  I tried pulling her up as hard as I could, but she wouldn’t budge.  Her grip was tight around the weeds, and I was weak. I gave up and swam to the surface. Seconds later, she did, too.
“Believe me now?” she hollered, as I stood up on the shore.
“Just come to shore,” I replied, feeling defeated. I was tired and my mind was spinning.
Kelly swam to shore and saddled up next to me. To my surprise she wasn't even out of breath. “So, do you want more proof?” she asked seriously.
“No.” Obviously, if she could stay under water for that length of time, then she had changed.
Kelly smelled her arm and grimaced. “Let's get out of here, we smell like ass.” Then she walked back to the dock and grabbed her clothes.   
The drive back to the cafe was a quiet one.  I needed time to absorb what I had just witnessed.  So what she’d told me was the truth?  That there really are things out there called Eternals that could live forever?
It sounded crazy but what other explanation was there?
Kelly parked her car in an empty spot and then shut off the engine.
“Why?” I asked
Kelly looked perplexed. “Why, what?”
“Why did you become one of them? How could you even consider killing another human being, just so you could live forever?”
Kelly took her time in answering. “I don't see it as me killing someone in order to live. In fact, I believe that the people who are not chosen to become an Eternal will be serving their own special purpose. It's kind of like that scene from the Lion King, you know the circle of life.”
“Circle of life, my ass!” I barked. “You made a choice to become a cold-blooded killer, and I think it is disgusting, selfish, and wrong!” I started to unlock the door to get out when Kelly grabbed me by the arm.
“Rani,” she said fearfully. “You cannot tell a soul what I’ve told you. If you do, not only will they kill me, but, they will kill you, too.”
I shook her hand off of me, now unable to look at my former best friend in the face. As far I as I was concerned, I would never be able to look at her the same. She’d made a decision that I couldn’t understand, and would never be able to forgive. “Don't worry - your dirty little secret is safe with me,” I hesitated and then said under my breath, “for now.
I left her and walked home, feeling as if I had the weight of the world on my shoulders.  All I wanted to do was go home, get into a hot bubble bath, and pretend that this day never happened.  
When I opened the front door of my house and was about to head upstairs, I heard strange grunting noises coming from the living room.
Oh my God!  My parents better not to be doing it in there!  I’d walked in on them once when I was ten, and knew that just seeing my dad’s naked ass had already scarred me for life. It was a horrifying experience, one that was now forever etched in my mind. I felt myself shudder at memory.
Disgusted, I walked back to the front door, opened it and then closed it loudly, hoping they’d hear it.
Thankfully, it must have done the trick, because the moaning and weird noises stopped.   As I was about to head upstairs, my mom called me into the living room.
I groaned. “Can it wait, Mom?” I didn’t feel like explaining why I was covered in green muck and smelled like rotten fish.
“No, it can't wait, come in here now.”
“Fine, I’m coming.” I slowly walked to the living room, picking as much of the dried up green crud as I could. When I stepped inside, I was surprised to see that my parents had a visitor.  A stranger.  
Oh crap, she must be selling something. As usual, my parents were the one couple in the neighborhood who just couldn’t say “no.”
“Oh, my goodness, what in the world happened to you?” mom asked while eying me from head-to-toe.
My dad looked around. “What is that smell?”  
I smiled innocently. “I dunno, maybe the sewer is backed up again?”  
“Rani,” said my mom, who was now standing right in front of me. “What happened to you?”
“Kelly and I were just goofing around by the old swimming hole, and I fell in, no big deal,” I said as nonchalantly as I could.
“You girls. Always getting into mischief. Well, I don't like it,” replied my dad, still trying to figure out where the horrible smell was coming from.
“Geez, Dad, it was an accident.” I was totally embarrassed that my parents were treating me like a child in front of a complete stranger.
The woman cleared her throat.
“Oh, my heavens,” said my mother, looking quite embarrassed. “I am so sorry for this.”
The woman laughed. “It is not a problem, Mrs. Vass.”
“I’ll be right back,” she replied. She then left the living room for a moment and returned with a towel from the closet, spreading it on the couch. “Here, Rani,” she said, smoothing it down. “Sit here.”
I sat down and stared at the woman, curious as to why she was in our living room and what exactly she was selling.
“Oh, my stars, I guess my manners have completely gone out the window today,” said my mom, looking uncomfortably nervous. “This is our daughter, Rani, and Rani… this is Gina Montgomery.”
I could feel the blood drain immediately from my face and it felt like the walls were closing in on me.  Gina Montgomery? That was the same name as the lady who went over to Kelly's house!  What the hell was she doing here?
I stood up and could feel the rage coursing through me. I faced my parents. “What the fuck is she doing here?” I yelled
My parents looked at me both wearing the same stunned expression, not saying a word.
“I said, what the FUCK is she doing here?” I whipped around and faced Gina. “GET OUT! NOW!”
Gina also looked a little surprise by my outburst. “Rani, I just want to talk to you,” she said in a calm and soothing voice.
“I know what you are, and I want you to get the FUCK outta my house!” I snapped, shoving her toward the front door. “There is no way my parents, or myself, would ever agree to become a monster like you!”
“Mr. and Mrs. Vass,” huffed Gina, as I pushed her closer and closer to the door.
“You just leave them alone!” I snarled, giving her a final push to the door.
“Rani!” hollered my father, rushing toward us, “That’s enough! I didn’t raise you this way!”
My eyes filled with tears. “But Dad, you don't know what she is! She's a… she's a monster!”
He grabbed me and pulled me into his arms. “Just sit down and hear Gina out,” he whispered. “I promise you’ll like what she has to say.”
A chill suddenly passed through me; I pushed away from my dad. “Oh, my God! Did you already do it?”
He didn’t respond.
I stared at both of them in horror. Dad had a pained expression and my mother was crying. She lowered her head, unable to meet my eyes. It was obvious that they’d fallen for the same bullshit that Kelly had.
I closed my eyes and shook my head; my world seemed to be crashing in around me.  
How could they do this?
The fact that they’d agreed to this made my heart ache. Apparently, I didn’t know my parents at all.
It became too much, and I knew that I had to get out of there, and quickly. I backed up and turned around, running as fast as I could out of our front door.
“Rani! Please come back, baby!” I heard my mother sob out as I raced down the driveway.
I ignored her and ran and ran, until my lungs felt like they were on fire.  When my side hurt and I couldn’t do it anymore, I hid behind a car that was parked on a deserted street to try and catch my breath. Then I pulled my cell phone out.
Several missed calls already from both my mom and dad.  
I began to cry. How could my parents do this to me?  Why would they choose to become one of those things?  
Overwhelmed with emotions, I sat behind the car until it started to get dark, ignoring the dozens of calls from my parents, along with the numerous voice messages.
What am I going to do?  Where am I going to go?
Just then, my cell phone buzzed again.
Christ, just leave me alone!
 I glanced at the caller ID.
Phil.  Thank God!  I swiped my fingers across the phone and answered.
“Hey, sweetie,” Phil said before I could say hello. The sound of his voice sounded like a chorus of angels to my ears.
“Hi, babe,” I whispered.
“Why are you whispering? You ok?” he asked, sounding concerned.
I decided that I needed to tell someone what was going on. I was afraid and not sure if I could handle this on my own. “No, actually, I am not all right.”
“What's wrong? Where are you?”
I sighed. “I am not exactly sure where I am.”
“What do you mean? Rani, you are really starting to scare me! Where are you?”
I stood up to try and read a street sign or something.  Our neighborhood has grown so much over the years that new streets seem to pop up every day.
“Um… I am not exactly sure, hang on just a sec.” I carefully ran toward the end of the street where a sign was posted. “Okay, I’m on the corner of Elm and First.”
“Stay there.  I will be there in 10 minutes.”
“Okay.”
I hung up and sat behind another parked car, realizing that I still had lake goo all over me.
Oh great, the man of my dreams is going to see me covered in green slime and smelling like dead fish.
Several minutes later, I recognized the headlights that were approaching. I jumped up and waved Phil down.  
He saw me, pulled up to where I was standing, and I got into his car.
“What happened to you?” he asked, looking me up and down.
“Long story. Can we please go to your place so I can take a shower?”
Phil put the car in gear and we headed in the direction of his condo. “So, you going to tell me what is going on?”
I slunk deeper into the seat, mentally exhausted. The day’s events slammed into me, all at once, like a million bricks. My parents. Kelly and the lake. Gina. The Eternals. It was just too much. “Can we talk later? I just need to rest my eyes for a minute.”
“Of course.”
I closed my eyes and let the motion of the car lull me to sleep.

***
Rani

I woke up in a panic.  
Where was I?
I glanced around the candlelit room and immediately relaxed. I was in Phil's living room.

I looked down and noticed that I was no longer wearing my crud-covered clothes and that I was now in a luxurious robe.
What is this, cashmere?
I hugged it closer to my body, loving the way it felt against my skin.  Then, when I peeked down the front of the robe, I noticed that I was naked.
“There is my sleeping beauty,” said Phil, walking into the room.
I smiled.
He gave me a kiss on the cheek. “Here, drink this,” he said, handing me a cup of steaming hot cocoa.
I grabbed the mug and took a sip. The chocolate felt wonderful as it slid down my throat and then warmed my insides. “So,” I said, peering at Phil over my mug. “How exactly did I end up in this robe?”
Phil cleared his throat and chuckled. “Well, I tried to wake you, but you were out like a light. I hate to say it, but you kind of had a funky odor going on.”
I could feel myself turning red. “You washed me off?”
“Babe, I had to… the smell was making my eyes water.” He gave me a smile that almost made me melt right there and then. “So, do you want to tell me what happened?”
I nodded and nervously began retelling him the horrific events that had transpired.  I was so afraid that he would think that I was crazy, or worse… not believe me.

 
Chapter Thirteen

Phil

I stared at Rani, already aware of what had happened. In fact, I’d received a call earlier in the day from Gina, telling me that Rani’s recruitment hadn’t gone as planned.
“How did you let her get away?” I’d barked into the phone.
“She surprised us all by taking off so quickly,” she’d argued. “She was gone before I could react.”	
I’d frowned into the phone, trying to quickly think of a way to rectify the situation.
“Phil? Are you still there?” she’d asked.
“Yeah, just… gimme a minute.”  .
“Sure.”
I’d closed my eyes and rubbed the bridge of my nose. “Okay, here is what you’re going to do - report to my father and tell him that all three were successful recruits.”
“But,” Gina had argued, “we can't do that. Your dad will find out. The new serum has some kind of tracking device. Remember?”
“Don't worry. I’ll take care of it.”
“But how? We have no idea where she went.”
“Do as I say and… don't worry about it.  I said I would take care of it, and I will.”
“I hope so.”
I’d only wanted Gina to make the change for the Vass family, so my hands would be clean. I loved Rani so much, that I did not want my identity to sway her decision in any way.  I even loved her enough that if she chose not to change, I’d have found a way to keep her alive.
Now, the woman I loved was sitting across from me, looking like a small child wrapped up in my robe, eagerly waiting for me to respond to the story she had just told me.
“Phil, please say something... anything.”
I reached over and put her hand in mine.
“I am so sorry that this has happened to you.”
“Yeah, well, I’m sorry it happened, too, Phil, but what in the hell am I going to do?”
I felt the syringe in my pocket and knew what I had to do.  I just prayed that someday she would realize that I did this out of my love for her. There was really no other way.
“Phil?”
My heart was heavy as I looked into her innocent, trusting eyes.  I knew there was nothing I could say or do to make her feel better.  I also knew that her life, after tonight, would never be the same again. Ever.

 

Chapter Fourteen

Rani

“Phil, say something,” I begged, “anything.”
He just stared at me.
I stood up and moved closer to him, but felt so dizzy and lightheaded, that I stumbled.
“Take it easy, sweetie,” said Phil, pulling me into his arms. “You have had a really rough day.”
I lay my head on his chest and listened to his heartbeat.
Thump, thump, thump…
The rhythmic sound put me at ease at once.
“I wish you would have stayed,” Phil said as he was stroking my hair.
“Stayed where?” I asked, confused.
“Your house,” said Phil softly. “I wish you would have stayed at your house, and listened to what Gina had to say.”
A chill ran through me. I pushed him away and stared into his eyes. The fear and sadness inside of them made me catch my breath. “What the hell do you mean - I should have stayed?  Did you not understand what I said about her?  She’s a monster!”
“I know what she is,” Phil said grimly, “because she and I are one in the same.”
I slapped Phil in the face, horrified by what he’d just said.  
He was an Eternal?  A monster?
I shook my head, not wanting to believe it.
“I am so sorry, Rani,” he whispered, looking defeated.
The next thing I knew, he pulled out what looked like a syringe and quickly plunged it into my arm.
“No!” I hollered, staring at him in horror. I could feel whatever was inside of the syringe, course through my body.
Oh, God, no.
The liquid felt like it was burning me from the inside out.  I tried to move my legs and then realized that I was completely paralyzed. It then must have somehow reached my heart, because I could actually feel it begin to slow.
Please, please, this cannot be happening!
Just as my heart was taking its last few beats, I heard him whispering in my ear, “ I am so sorry, Rani, I hope you know how much I love you.”
I felt him softly kissing my lips.
Then in an instant… there was nothing.
Nothing except… darkness.

Prologue



“Mom left the door unlocked,” I hollered at my twin brother as he slammed the door to his ’67 Mustang. It was the last day of eleventh grade, and we’d stopped off for burgers and malts at Grannie’s Diner with some friends to celebrate after school. Nathan and I were officially seniors and neither of us could wipe the grins from our faces. 
“That’s weird,” he said, brushing a hand through his sandy-brown hair. “You know how she’s always nagging us about doing it.”
I grinned and held the door open for him. “I’m certainly not going to let her live this one down.”   
Mom was married to a cop once, my father, and he’d drilled into her head how important it was to keep the doors locked, even when you’re home.
Nathan followed me into the kitchen and opened the refrigerator. 
“Oh, my God,” I teased him. “How can you still be hungry after eating that monster burger and malt?”
He flexed a muscle. “I’m growing,” he said. “Just ‘cause you’re a skinny little twerp doesn’t mean everyone else has to eat like a bird.”
I walked over and punched him in the arm. “Very funny.”
He smiled and raised the milk carton to take a swig when we both heard it.
“What’s that?” I whispered.
He slammed down the milk and rushed out of the kitchen. 
“Nathan?” I yelled, chasing him upstairs. The sobs were coming from somewhere in the upper level of the house and my stomach twisted in horror. 
Mom?
“Oh, my God,” he choked, entering her dark bedroom. She was lying naked on the floor next to the bed, her face swollen and bleeding, her body badly bruised.  
We rushed to her side and she cracked open one of her black eyes. “Call the police,” she mumbled, barely coherent.
I started to cry as I grabbed the phone and dialed nine-one-one. I don’t even remember talking to the person who’d answered. All I know is that I was blubbering and she was trying to console me with the fact that help was coming. 
I hung up and stared at my broken mother in shock, feeling helpless and frightened. Thankfully, Nathan handled stress much better than I did.
He grabbed a comforter and covered her gently.  “Mom, what happened?” he asked, pushing her dark bangs away from her eyes.
The shame on her face was heart-wrenching and I pretty much knew by her appearance what had happened. She’d obviously been beaten and raped.
I brushed the tears from my face, kneeled down next to her, and lightly touched her hand. “The police and ambulance are on their way.”
She nodded and closed her eyes.
“Mom?” prodded Nathan. “What happened?”
“Nathan, think about it,” I whispered. “She’s been raped.”
His lips trembled as he searched her face. “Mom, some stranger broke in here and… did this?”  
She opened her eyes and stared at both of us for a few seconds. “No… no stranger,” she whispered hoarsely. “It was your father.”
 

Chapter One


“Are we almost there?” I asked, staring through my sunglasses at the endless rows of cornfields. We’d been driving for hours through the countryside and I could no longer tell the difference from one town to the next. More than anything, I just wanted to get out of the car and stretch my legs, which were starting to tingle in an uncomfortable way.
Mom cleared her throat. “Pretty soon.”
Nathan was following us in his Mustang and I glanced back to see him talking on his cell phone once again. 
“Oh, Lord,” I said, leaning my head back against the headrest. “He must be talking to Deanna for the tenth time. She just won’t get over the fact that we’re really moving.”
Mom tightened her hands on the steering wheel and glanced at me. “I’m sorry about this. I’m just so sorry… about everything.”
I groaned. “Mom, for crying out loud, it’s not your fault. I can’t even believe you’re feeling guilty about it. I mean, nobody had any idea that he could be so violent.”
It had been less than three months since my father had brutally attacked my mother. They’d been separated for the last couple of years because of his sporadic temper tantrums, along with his inability to stop screwing other women. When my mother had finally gotten up the nerve to leave him, surprisingly, he’d actually been pretty civil about it. Then, when he’d found out she’d moved on emotionally and started dating again, he’d went off in a jealous rage, striking back at her viciously. We were all still stunned about the horrifying ordeal.
“I just wish they could locate him,” she said, staring straight ahead. “He’s… crazy.”
I nodded. I was so ashamed, that any thoughts of him made me physically ill. It was still really hard to believe that my own father was capable of being so violent, especially since he’d been a cop and responsible for keeping people safe. After the attack, he’d disappeared, and my poor mother had spent several nights in the hospital recovering. When she finally came home, she wasn’t able to sleep at night without drugs, terrified that he’d show up and beat her again. Then, just recently, she’d been given a gift; a way out. Her employer offered her an accounting job in Montana and that’s where all three of us were now headed; to start a new life.
“I think it’s good that Nathan’s getting away from Deanna anyway,” I said, staring in dismay at my short, stubbly nails. Not that they’d been perfect before, but all of the packing and cleaning had taken its toll. “She’s so whiny and annoying.”
Mom smiled wryly. “Now, Nikki, you haven’t liked any of Nathan’s girlfriends.”
 “It’s not my fault he attracts the psycho ones.”
She burst out laughing and I smiled, enjoying a sound that was finally finding its way back into our lives again.
 “God, you’re awful,” she said, shaking her head in amusement. 
I snorted. “Oh, come on. You know I’m right.”
She grabbed her Ray-Bans from the center column and plopped them onto her nose. “Yeah, he’s a little too young to be tied down to just one girl. So if you ask me, this move will be healthy for the both of them.”
“Oh, I’m sure Deanna will find someone else by next week anyway.” I made a face. “She’s so freaken needy.”
“You really don’t like her, do you?”
I shrugged. 
Deep down, I knew I wasn’t being totally fair, because the truth was, I was a little jealous. My brother and I had always been very close, especially living in such a dysfunctional family environment. My earliest memories were of my parents screaming and fighting, especially during the holidays. So, we’d weathered the storms together. In fact, for all of our lives, we’d been best friends; sharing and doing everything together. That is, until the tenth grade, when he’d discovered boobs, I mean girls. Of course I’d discovered boys as well; I’d discovered that most of them in my school were crude, boring, or just plain boobs. 
“So, mom,” I said, changing a subject in which, I had to admit, left me feeling a little guilty. “What were you saying about this place we’re renting?”
She grinned. “I guess it’s just beautiful. It’s a cabin on Shore Lake that’s been on the market for some time. The owners are related to Ernie, and because of our circumstances; they’re letting us stay there relatively cheap.”
Ernie was my mom’s boss; a really nice old man who’s been very supportive. He’s been like a father-figure to her, which is good because both of her parents passed away several years ago, and aside from us, she doesn’t have anyone else.
“A cabin sounds really cool. Do they happen to have a boat?”
“Yes, actually, and Ernie says he’s caught hundreds of fish on the lake, so we’ve got to check it out. I’m really excited about staying there. Honey, are you okay?”
“Something in my eye,” I muttered as I pulled down the visor. I blinked until I finally got the eyelash out. 
I touched my long, unruly hair and frowned. It had been almost six months since I’d last had it cut; now it was down to my lower back and I was constantly fighting snarls. “Jeez, I could really use a haircut.”
She put a hand on my shoulder and squeezed. “Don’t worry, honey. We’ll get you one before school starts. Once I get some extra money, you know?”
“Sure.”
I bit my lower lip and examined my reflection. Sandy brown hair, light blue eyes, and a pug nose. I’d always considered myself average looking, even though my mom said I looked exactly like her when she was growing up, and she turned out to be attractive. In fact, most of Nathan’s friends said she was a hot MILF, which was pretty gross, but I guess that meant there was still hope for me. 
I closed the visor and leaned my head back against the seat. “I wonder what the school is like.”
I was definitely a little nervous about going to a new school, although, truthfully, I knew I wouldn’t particularly miss the old one much. In fact, you could say I was sort of a loner. Sure, there were a couple of girls I’d hung out with back home occasionally, but I preferred to be alone most of the time, or hanging out with Nathan. 
“Ernie didn’t say much, but honestly, I don’t expect him to know. He’s in his seventies and never had children.”
“I’m sure it will be fine.”
I really didn’t want my mom to worry about me. She was the one who needed the extra support from us and I wasn’t about to make her feel any more guilty about moving than she already did. 
She slapped her fingers on the steering wheel. “Oh, I forgot to tell you, they have a computer, so you can surf the Internet.”
“Really? That’s cool,” I smiled. Although we used computers at school and my mom had her own laptop, I’d been nagging her forever about getting me one of my own. 
“Yes, but you’ll have to share it with your brother. I’d let you guys use mine, but…”
I smirked. “I know, you have too many important files and you don’t want anything happening to your computer.”
“Now you have one to use,” she answered. “And I won’t have to listen to you two badger me about it, anymore.”
“At least I can download books from the library,” I replied. “We’ll be in the middle of nowhere out here and I’ll need something to do.”
“Oh, I’m sure you’ll find plenty of things to do. Wait until you start school and meet some new friends. Or,” her face lit up, “maybe even some cute boys.”
I rolled my eyes. “Right. I doubt very much that’s going to happen.”
“Why in Heaven’s name would you say that? You’re a very pretty girl, Nikki. Don’t sell yourself short.”
The truth was, I couldn’t care less about meeting anyone at the moment. Most of the girls at my old school had been constantly stressed out because of their immature boyfriends and I wasn’t about to go down that road, especially in my last year of high school. “It doesn’t matter.”  
 She frowned. “Sure it does. You’ll want to go to all the dances, and then there’s the prom. You don’t want to miss out on all the fun. You’ll regret it later.”
“Didn’t you go with dad to the prom?” I asked, then immediately felt rotten when I saw the bitterness reflected in her eyes.
“I did,” she said slowly. “But, he wasn’t always so… volatile. And, really, he’s among the very few out there like that. You know, Nikki, you can’t be afraid of the world because your dad has some issues.”
Yeah, but weren’t we running because she was still very much afraid? 
Of course, I didn’t dare mention that. Instead, I just changed the subject.
“So, how much farther of a drive do we have, mom?” I asked, noticing the mountains coming up in the distance.  
“Oh, just a couple more hours,” she replied, plugging in her iPod. Seconds later, Adele, began to sing about Rumors. 
I stretched my arms and yawned.
“Honey,” she said, lowering her sunglasses, “you look beat; why don’t you try and get some rest? I’ll wake you when we get there.”
“Okay,” I said, closing my eyes. “Maybe I’ll just take a little nap.”

~~~

“Why not, mom? I just don’t understand,” protested Nathan.
She sighed. “Can we please talk about Deanna later?”
I woke up to the sound of mom and Nathan arguing. We were parked by a small grocery store and he was standing outside of her window, pouting.
“Oh God, not now,” I mumbled. It was getting dark and we’d missed dinner and my stomach was protesting. I was cranky, and the last thing I needed was to hear any more drama about Deanna.
“Can’t she just come for a week before school starts?” said Nathan. “She’s having a rough time with her parents, and now that I’m gone, things have gotten even worse. It’s not fair for her.”
She shook her head. “No, we have too much to do with unpacking and getting ready for school. Maybe she can come and visit sometime after it starts for a weekend.”
“This is all bullshit,” he snapped, backing up from the window. He raised his hands in exasperation. “We could have stayed home. I would’ve protected you. Now we’re forced to move, and you didn’t even give me a chance.”
“Nathan!” I gasped. “You are the one not being fair. Mom’s been through so much and you’re just mad because you can’t see Deanna whenever you want. God, you’re being an asshole.”
His face turned red and he opened up his mouth to retaliate when mom quickly interrupted.
“Okay, let’s all settle down. Quit pointing fingers at each other, and Nikki, watch your mouth.”
“Sorry,” I mumbled.
“Listen, it isn’t either of your faults, okay? And, Nathan,” she said, smiling sadly, “I’m grateful that you want to protect me, but you can’t possibly follow me around twenty-four hours a day, nor do I expect you to be my personal bodyguard. Now, as far as Deanna goes, we’ll talk about it later. Comprende?”
He nodded but was still sulking and I could tell that this conversation was far from over.
She noticed it as well and rubbed her forehead in frustration. “Okay, let’s get the things we need in the grocery store before it gets dark. I don’t want to get lost while searching for this cabin.”
“Let’s go,” I said, opening my door.
Nathan followed us into the store, still moping. 
“Nathan, would you please cheer up?” she pleaded when we were in the frozen pizza section and he refused to pick out food.
“Yeah,” I said. “Don’t ruin our first night here because of a girl who’s probably lining up her next soul-mate as we speak.”
“Would you just shut-up?” he snapped. “You’re just jealous because you didn’t leave anyone behind that mattered.”
I took a step towards him. “Excuse me? Jealous!?”
“Stop it!” hissed mom, getting into both of our faces. “We’re in public and you’re both acting… ridiculous. Now, I’m sorry that we had to move, I really am. But we’re here now and there’s no turning back. So get it together, or I swear to God, I won’t buy any ice cream.”
Nathan raised his hands in the air. “Okay, mom, just settle down. We can talk about this, no need to bring ice cream into the equation. That’s cruel.”
She smirked. “That’s what I thought.” She then turned to me. “What about you? Are you going to lay off Deanna, who isn’t even here to defend herself?”
“Fine,” I replied tightly. “As long as he stops talking about her every five minutes.”
“Whatever,” he replied, shaking his head. 
She closed her eyes and rubbed the bridge of her nose. “You know, maybe this was a mistake, I don’t know.” She opened her eyes. “But, what’s done is done, and we have to make the best of it. So, please, quit arguing and let’s try to make the best of this. Okay?”    
We both agreed, but avoided eye contact. 
“Okay,” she said, smiling again. “Now, let’s finish this up and find the cabin. I think you’re going to really like living out here if you just give it a chance. I mean, come on, you have to admit – the scenery is beautiful.” 
“California was beautiful too,” replied Nathan, grabbing a stack of pizzas from the freezer. “I’m just saying…”
She rolled her eyes. “Seriously?”
He put the pizzas in the cart. “Okay, fine, I’ll admit that it’s different here – the fresh air, the mountains, all of the greenness. I guess it’s cool.”
“Thank you. Now, let’s grab some Hot Pockets and Pizza Rolls,” she said, staring at the case.   
I grimaced. “Hot Pockets?”
She motioned her thumb at Nathan. “We need to keep him fed. Those are quick and easy.”
It was true, he was always hungry, and once his blood sugar began to drop, grumpier than all hell. Our dad’s family was prone to Diabetes and mom predicted we’d both end up getting it someday.
I opened the glass door and began sorting through the Hot Pockets with Nathan directing. Forty-five minutes later, the entire cart was full and Deanna was temporarily forgotten. 
“That will be two-hundred-and-forty dollars,” said the cashier, snapping her gum.  
Mom handed the young woman her credit card while the cashier appraised Nathan as he bagged the groceries. When he finished, she smiled. “Thanks. You didn’t have to do that, you know. It’s my job.”
“That’s okay. I don’t mind.”  
“You guys just move here?” she asked, twirling a piece of her blonde hair around her index finger.
I refrained from rolling my eyes.  
“We did,” smiled my mother. “Just today, in fact.”
“Cool,” replied the girl, still staring at him like he was a pair of designer jeans that she couldn’t possibly live without. “See you around.”
“Yeah,” replied Nathan as he began to push the grocery cart outside without a backwards glance.
Mom and I looked at each other in amusement. Sometimes men were so clueless.
“Let’s put the groceries in your car, Nathan,” said mom as we stepped back outside. “Mine is too full already.” 
“Okay,” he replied, veering towards his vehicle.
As we were trying to stuff the food into the back of Nathan’s Mustang, a soft voice greeted us. “Hi. You must be new in town?”
We all turned around to see a striking redhead getting out of a tall Chevy pickup. She wore a miniscule white sundress, which showed off her toned legs, and dark sunglasses, which I thought was a little odd, considering it was dusk.
Nathan’s blue eyes lit up and he grinned. “Yeah, we just pulled into town.”
She removed her sunglasses and smiled back. “I hope you enjoy it here. It’s quaint, but there are lots of things to do, especially after dark.”
Her teeth were pearly white and her hair was a mass of shiny curls. She dropped her keys, and after she bent to retrieve them, tossed her hair back over her shoulder. It was a simple thing, but it had an immediate effect on Nathan. Truthfully, I didn’t think anybody should be that gorgeous.
Before my mother or I could get in a word, Nathan spoke up in a surprisingly deeper voice. “Thanks for the info. Maybe we’ll run into each other sometime.”
 “Maybe. It was really nice meeting you,” she replied, clearly directing it towards Nathan, who looked like he’d all but forgotten about Deanna. Then she sashayed into the store like a runway model while we all stared.
“Wow,” I smirked, turning towards my brother. “You can reel your tongue back in now.”
“What do you mean?” 
I snorted. “Oh, come on, Nathan.”
He smiled innocently. “There’s nothing wrong with being friendly to strangers, especially when they look like that.”
“I think the feeling was mutual,” replied mom, looking at me. “That smile she gave him was enough to light up the entire town.” 
“How can she resist?” he said cockily. “Heck, I’ll bet that I’m the best thing that’s ever walked into this town.”
I rolled my eyes. “Oh, Lord. Here we go.”
He flexed left arm muscle. “Oh, come on, you know I’m right.”
“I certainly do,” said mom, leaning over to kiss his cheek. 
“Yeah, and mom’s biased,” I replied. “Don’t let it go to your head.”
He ignored me and started packing more groceries into the back of his trunk. “Let’s get the rest of this stuff loaded quickly,” he said, glancing up towards the sky, which was growing darker. “I’m starving and it’s getting late.”
“Me too,” I replied, handing him another bag of groceries.
When we had everything in the trunk, Mom gave Nathan the directions to the cabin, which was a few miles past town, and this time, he led the way. 
“Finally,” I said, putting on my seatbelt as she pulled out of the parking lot. “I just want to get there already.”
“Won’t be long now.”
Darkness came very quickly, and in a small town without many lights along the roads, it was a little creepy. 
“It’s a bitch driving when you don’t know exactly where you’re going in the dark,” said mom, frowning. “I think the turnoff is coming up in another few miles or so. I hope Nathan catches it in time and doesn’t overshoot it.”
“Knowing him, he probably will,” I answered with a smirk, “especially, if he’s on the phone with Deanna again.”
“He seemed to forget about her when that redhead made an appearance.”
“Thank God, although, she’s probably worse than Deanna.”
“Let’s hope not.”
I stared at her in shock. “See, you weren’t crazy about her either!”
She turned down the radio. “Are you kidding me?” she groaned, scowling into the rearview mirror.
I turned to see the flashing lights from a police car. “What, were you speeding or something?”
She pulled over to the side of the road. “No, you know me, I never speed.”
It was true, my mother was an annoyingly slow driver and Nathan was always giving her crap about it. Even grandmothers passed her on the roadway. 
Mom rolled down the window as the police officer approached her. She immediately handed him her driver’s license and insurance information. “I’m sorry, officer… was I speeding?”
My brother had noticed the cop, too, and pulled over ahead of us, waiting. He’d sent me a text message, wondering what was happening. I’d sent him one back, explaining that I wasn’t really sure, yet.
“No, but you do have a taillight out,” he replied with an easy smile.
My eyes widened as I stared at his mouth. What’s with this town and their unnaturally white teeth?
“Oh, no, really?” she answered, biting her lower lip. “Oh, man, I’m sorry. It must have just went out.”
“Yes. Anne Gerard… you must be new in town?” he asked, studying her license.
She smiled. “We are, in fact,” she pointed towards me, “this is my daughter, Nikki, and that’s my son, Nathan, ahead of us in the Mustang.”
He glanced down at her left hand, which no longer had a wedding ring, and his smile broadened.
“Ladies, I’m Sherriff Caleb Smith. Welcome to Shore Lake,” he answered, giving her back her license.
Was it me or did he actually puff out his chest a little before he leaned back down and handed it back?
“Thank you,” answered my mom with a silly grin on her face. She definitely noticed the puff.
“Since you have such a lovely smile and you’re new in town, I’m just going to give you a warning. Make sure that you take care of it as soon as you can, though. Next time I might not be so easy on you.”
Mom smiled wider than ever. “I will, thank you, officer.”
He tipped his hat. “My friends call me Caleb. Drive safely now.”
“Wow,” said mom after she’d rolled up her window. “Did you see that man’s eyes? They were an amazing shade of violet. I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone with that color of eyes. No wedding ring, either.”
I stared at her in disbelief. “Oh, my God mom, we just got into town!” 
“Yeah, but I agree with Nathan that there’s nothing wrong with making new friends; especially friends who are in law enforcement,” she replied with a straight face.
“Well, I guess,” I answered, staring into the darkness. Obviously, she was beginning to get a handle on her fears and I should have been relieved, but instead, it only made me… uneasy.

 
Chapter Two


 
When we finally made it to the cabin, my jaw literally dropped.
“What do you think?” asked mom as she parked the car next to Nathan’s.
“Wow. It’s amazing,” I replied, opening the car door. “Are you sure this is the right place?”
“It is. I saw pictures but wanted to surprise you,” she said, getting out of the car.
This was no average lakeside cabin; it looked like something you’d see on a “Top Ten List” of some luxurious getaways. 
“This must be worth millions. I can’t believe we’re staying here,” I said, unable to wipe the grin from my face. I felt like someone had just shouted “Move that bus!” and we were looking at our new dream home.
“Yes, it’s quite extraordinary,” she said, staring up at the cabin. “I’m still in shock that we get to stay here, too. Ernie is a lifesaver.”
“He’s more like Santa Claus,” I replied, feeling giddy. I couldn’t wait to check out the inside. It was possible that Shore Lake wasn’t going to suck quite as much as I thought.
She reached back into the car and pulled out her cell phone. “I’d better call him once we’ve unpacked the groceries. Let him know we’ve made it and how thrilled we are.” Her eyes became misty. “You know, I just can’t thank him enough for everything he’s done.”
I agreed with her there. This place was beyond words. Heck, everything about it screamed money, too, from the expensive cedar wood frame to the thick-plated enormous glass windows; it reminded me of a mountainside chateau in Europe. 
“Impressive, huh?” she said.
“Yeah.”
Especially with its two-tiered deck that someone had built on north side of the cabin, and a massive porch that wrapped around the entire main floor. There was even a gazebo with a hot tub next to a courtyard which contained a large grill and several pieces of outdoor furniture for entertaining. Unfortunately, we had nobody to entertain.
“Wow,” said Nathan as he got out of the car and walked over to us. He was also staring in amazement at the cabin. “How in the world did you score such an awesome place?”
Mom smiled. “Ernie.”
“Look, there’s the boathouse.” I pointed down towards the lake. Even that place looked like it was larger than some of the homes in our old neighborhood.
“Cool,” said Nathan, nodding in approval. “I hope the weather is nice tomorrow, so that we can take the boat out,” he started walking towards the dock. “I wonder what kind of boat they have?”
“Check later,” said mom, grabbing her purse. “We need to get this stuff inside.”
He sighed and turned around. “Okay. It’s probably too dark to see anything now anyway.”  
She took the keys out of her purse and began walking towards the cabin. “You know, I’m really surprised that there isn’t some kind of alarm on the cabin. I mean, this place is vacant most of the time.” She sighed. “I hope when we get inside, nothing is missing.”
“Everyone must trust each other in these parts,” I said, following her up the steps to the front door.
“Apparently,” she answered, putting the key into the lock. When we stepped inside, she flipped on the lights and my breath caught in my throat.  
“Wow…” said Nathan. “This place is… tight.”
“It’s amazing,” she said, taking a step back. “I’m just, speechless.”
“Can we step inside of the doorway, people?” I said, swatting at a mosquito. “Before the bugs enter before we do?”
“Oh, sorry,” she chuckled.
We entered what had to be called the “great room.” It was enormous and had a large soapstone fireplace with a bearskin rug lying near it, which was kind of hokey to me but it certainly added to the affect. Plush burgundy colored leather furniture with hand-carved wooden end tables sat across from the fireplace, and I imagined myself in the chair-and-a-half, reading a book next to a crackling fire.  
“Wow, I just love those light fixtures,” gushed mom, staring at the dozens of rustic chandeliers that made the place glow with warmth. She walked over to a row of intricately carved shelves and touched the amber colored wood. “And all of this lovely hand-carved woodwork, the leather furniture, and… oh God, what isn’t there to love about this place? Next time I see Ernie, I’m going to plant a huge kiss on his little bald head.”
“You should,” said Nathan. He raised his voice a few octaves and put a hand on his hip. “And give him a big sloppy one from me, too.”
“Oh, so you’re finally warming up to us being here?” she asked.
He grinned. “Mom, seriously, if you’re happy, then I’m happy.”
She walked over to Nathan and threw her arms around him. “I swear, I have the two best kids in the world.”
“Love you, too, mom,” he answered, patting her gently on the back. “And don’t worry, everything will work out. Even… even with Deanna. Seriously.”
“Good, I’m glad you feel that way,” she replied, releasing him. “I just want everything to work out for you and your sister.”
“Don’t worry. I’m sure it will,” he replied.  
“Guys, I’m going to check out the upstairs,” I said, climbing the staircase, two steps at a time. I could barely contain my excitement now that I knew we were actually staying at such a glamorous place.
“Pick out a bedroom!” she called as I made it to the top of the stairs. “I don’t care which; I hear they’re all pretty nice.”
“Will do!” I hollered back.
There were several bedrooms on the upper level, all spacious and each having their own bathroom. I chose one with a queen-sized pillow-top bed and a small balcony with an awesome view of the lake.
“So, what do you think?” asked my mom from the doorway, a few minutes later.
“Oh, my God, I love it!” I squealed. “I feel like we’re on vacation somewhere. I wish we could stay here forever.”
“I know, it’s pretty breathtaking. I don’t know about this one, but my bedroom has its own Jacuzzi and a closet so big, I could park the car in it. I’m going to check out yours.”
While she did that, I walked over to the balcony door and opened it, enjoying the cool air on my cheek. It was dark outside, but the reflection of the moon on the water made the lake seem so peaceful. I imagined myself lying on some kind of canoe or boat, staring up at the moon with the waves rocking me to sleep. “I just can’t believe this place. If we’re dreaming, I never want to wake up.”
She stepped next to me and linked her arm through mine. “Don’t worry, it’s real.”
My stomach began to growl and I patted it. “I don’t know about you, but I’m starving.”
“Yeah, I’m getting there myself. Let’s go see if Nathan did what I asked and brought the groceries inside. I’ll make us something to eat.”
“Okay.”
We went back downstairs and I helped mom put the rest of the groceries away in the fridge, which actually looked like the wooden cupboards surrounding it. 
She took out a frying pan from one of the boxes in the kitchen and smiled. “Who wants homemade sliders? It might be ghetto here, but I’m not about to give those up.” 
“Yeah, I’ll take as many as you can make,” replied Nathan as he entered the kitchen. “I’m going to pass out if I don’t get something to eat soon.”
“I’m surprised you’re still walking,” I said. 
“Me too,” he said, opening up the refrigerator. He grabbed a jar of pickles and untwisted the cap. Before he could get his fingers inside of the jar, mom stopped him.
“Here,” she said, handing him a fork. “Don’t use your fingers.”
He grinned sheepishly. “Oh, thanks.”
“So,” she said as she began preparing dinner, “is this place incredible or what?”
“Not too shabby,” said Nathan between bites of his pickle. “And it’s so quiet, I feel like we’re in the middle of nowhere.”
Mom nodded. “The next cabin is just a hop, skip, and a jump from here, but you’d never know it’s so peaceful.”
“Yeah, you did good, mom,” I said, cutting the onions for our burgers. “I just can’t wait until tomorrow when we get to see it all in the daylight.”
Nathan nodded. “Yeah, I’d really like to take the boat out on the lake tomorrow, if that’s okay?”
“Sure,” she answered
He wiped his hands on his jeans. “Sweet.”
She opened the fridge and grabbed the cheese. “I think that would be good for all of us to get out on that lake. I haven’t been able to work on my tan all summer.”
I snorted; my mom was as white as a ghost and typically burned and peeled, but never really tanned. My brother and I were the opposite, fortunately, even though you’d never know it this year. I just hadn’t had the time to get any sun, especially after the “incident.”
After dinner, I helped her with the dishes and then decided to check out the whirlpool tub in my bathroom.
“I’m taking a long, relaxing bath and then going to bed,” I said as we neared the staircase. It had been a long drive and I was so exhausted, I didn’t even feel like unpacking anything just yet.
“Okay,” she replied, kissing the top of my head. “I’ll see you in the morning.”
A moving company had dropped off our belongings earlier in the day and I found some of my own boxes very quickly. After carrying them to my room, I grabbed a towel and the fluffy white robe my mom had given me for Christmas last year. As I was about to walk into my bathroom to start the tub, there was a soft knock.
“Yeah?” 
My brother opened the door. “Hey, I’m sorry about snapping at you earlier. You were right,” he said with a sheepish grin. “I was being a little bit of an asshole.”
“Don’t worry, I’m used to it.”
He folded his arms across his chest. “You were kind of a bitch too, you know.”
I gasped. “I’ll show you bitch,” I replied, throwing my hairbrush at him. It missed and hit the wall next to the door.
“Better work on your aim,” he replied with a smirk.
I picked up my curling iron and raised it in the air. “Leave before I give you ringlets! I swear to God, I’ll make you pretty!”  
He brushed his bangs away from his eyes. “Can you include a bow? I’d look even prettier with a bow.”
I broke down and started laughing. “You are such a freak.”
“No need to be jealous. You’re my twin and kind of a freak, too.”
“Lucky me.” 
He smiled. “Night, Nik. I’ll see you in the morning.”
“Okay, goodnight.”
After he left, I grabbed my things and stepped into the black and white marbled bathroom, locking the door behind me. When I turned back around, I smiled.
Amazing.
There was even a large panoramic window surrounding the Jacuzzi with a view of the lake. Although it was dark and I couldn’t see much of anything outside, I imagined during the day, it was incredible.
I walked over to the large square tub and turned on the water. I sat on the edge and watched it rise slowly, wondering how many gallons I’d be using before it covered the jets entirely. It was enormous, even larger than the pool we’d had as kids. Hell, the entire bathroom was fit for a celebrity and I was going to use it for the next year or two? I decided to kiss Ernie myself the next time I saw him.
I stood back up and opened the new vanilla-scented spa bath gift set my mom had given me. I then lit the candle that came with it and placed it near the tub. When the water was high enough, I pulled my hair back into a ponytail, turned off the lights, and removed my shirt and jeans. 
“Oh, yeah, now that’s what I’m talking about,” I whispered, groaning in pleasure as I sunk into the warm bath. I laid my head against the bath pillow and closed my eyes. I imagined it couldn’t possibly get any better, but then remembered I’d forgotten my iPod. If this was Heaven, then listening to the music could only take me to another level of bliss.
As I stood up to grab a towel, my eyes were drawn towards a movement near the right side of the window that I was now facing. My heart stopped as a set of fiery-red eyes stared back at me. When I finally found my voice, I screamed in horror, and whatever it was, quickly shot away.
“Mom!” I shrieked, trying not to slip on the wet floor. I grabbed my robe and skidded out of the bathroom as quickly as possible. 
“What is it?” she cried, bursting through the door, also wearing her yellow terrycloth robe.
Trembling, I pointed towards the bathroom. “Mom,” I choked, “someone was watching me in the window! They saw me naked!”
Her eyes widened and she reached for the softball bat sticking out of one of my boxes. With my heart pounding in my chest, I followed her into the bathroom, half expecting someone to jump out of the shadows. She kept the light switch off and moved towards the window.
“Do you see anything?” I whispered over her shoulder.
Sighing, she turned to me and lowered the bat. “No.”
I looked back towards the darkness, and a shiver ran down my spine. I turned back to her. “Are you sure?”
Her forehead wrinkled. “Yes, I’m sure. I also don’t see how anyone could be watching you from this height, Nikki.”
“Mom, something was watching me. I’m not lying.”
She touched my cheek. “Baby, it’s been a long day and we’re in the middle of the woods. You probably saw a bird flying by – or maybe even a bat. Don’t be frightened.”
My bedroom was several feet from the ground, and truthfully, I really wasn’t sure what I’d seen. Obviously, it had to be some kind of animal. “I guess that’s possible.”
She held out a hand to me. “Come here and see for yourself. Look how far up we really are.”
Of course, when I looked back outside, common sense told me that we were too high for any person to be looking in. 
I closed my eyes. “Yeah, okay, maybe it was just a stupid bat or something.”
“Honey, you’re obviously very tired. Why don’t you go to bed and get a good night’s sleep? I’ll bet that tomorrow, you’ll be laughing about this.”
“Is everything okay in here?” asked Nathan, standing in the doorway in his blue flannel pajama pants.
“Everything’s fine,” she answered with another reassuring smile. “Nikki just saw a bird or something outside and it scared the hell out of her.”
Nathan’s eyebrows shot up. “Seriously? You know, I thought I saw something out there, too, when I was in my room watching TV. It freaked the shit out of me.”
I turned to see her reaction. 
“What?” she asked, staring at both of us, amused. “Come on… it’s some kind of bird. You know, there’s no possible way a living person could stand outside of your bedroom windows and look in. Unless Spider-man is vacationing in Montana and has decided to scale this particular cabin to check us out. You two are wigging out over nothing.”
“Still, I think we should take a look outside,” said Nathan as he turned and walked away. 
“Wait!” my mom hollered. She picked up the bat and charged after him. “Don’t go out there without this!”
And she thought I was being paranoid?
I followed them both downstairs and watched as he switched on the outdoor lights and threw open the front door. 
“Be careful!” I hollered, staying back. There was no way I was going out into that unknown darkness, harmless bird or not.
My mom hesitantly followed Nathan outside while I wrapped my arms around myself, trying to remain calm under the circumstances.
This is crazy, I thought, when they closed the door behind them. I wondered if it really was some kind of large bird checking both of us out. Maybe an owl or eagle?
But with red eyes? 
Owls were nocturnal so I imagined it was possible, although, I was a city girl and didn’t know the first thing about birds, other than they pooped, a lot, whenever they felt like it. 
I chewed on my lower lip and stared towards the dark windows, suddenly wondering if someone or something was watching me from the other side. 
Oh, my God… close the blinds, idiot!
I leaped towards the windows, moving the wooden blinds over the four large plated windows as quickly as possible. Once they were all covered, I took a step back and began breathing again.  
While I waited for my mom and brother to return, I couldn’t help it, I began to pace as the anxiety quickly built up again. I was definitely wigging out just like she’d said. I started imaging things like Sasquatches and aliens, freaking myself out until I felt like I was almost to the point of hyperventilating.
Jesus, Nikki, chill the hell out. 
Frustrated, I went back over to the sofa and sat down, tapping my foot nervously.  Seconds later, my brother stormed through the front door, followed by my mom, whose face was as pale as the moon. He picked up the phone and started dialing.
My stomach tightened when I noticed the strange look on Nathan’s face. “Okay, what’s going on?”  
Nathan raised his hand to silence me and then began speaking, his voice strangled. “Hello? Yes, I’d like to report a dead body.”
 

Chapter Three


 
Three hours later, the dead body, which they’d found near the dock, was examined, bagged, and finally taken away. 
“Well,” said Sheriff Caleb Smith, who was standing on the porch. “It looks like it’s the teenage girl who’s been missing for a few weeks, Tina Johnson.”
“What happened to her?” I asked, staring at him. He was taller than I’d thought, standing well over six-foot, had dark hair that hung just below his collar, and an almost perfectly chiseled face, except for his nose, which was a little large. I had to admit, though, for a guy in his thirties, he was handsome.
My mother, who was staring up at him as if he was Superman, cleared her throat. “Before you answer that, would you like to come in and have a cup of coffee, Sheriff?”  
He grinned widely and stepped inside. “Thanks; don’t worry about the coffee, though. I really need to be leaving soon.”
“So, was she murdered?” asked Nathan, still freaked out about finding her bloated body sticking out of the water. He’d described it so many times to me that I could see the image in my head, as if I’d actually been there.
The sheriff shook his head. “I don’t think so. She had a history of drinking and left a party pretty intoxicated at the time she went missing. She may have simply fallen into the water and drowned. There will be an autopsy, however, so we’ll know more later.”
Nathan, who watched a lot of C.S.I. shows on television, crossed his arms over his chest. “So, there were no witnesses? Nobody at the party actually saw her leave?”
The sheriff put his hand on the wall and leaned against it. “No. That particular party got a little out of hand and we ended up arresting a few minors for intoxication that night. It was an ugly mess.”
“Goodness,” said mom. “What a horrible thing for her parents. I can’t imagine what it’s been like for them.”
He nodded, looking very somber. “Just like us, they’ve been frantically searching for her all over this town and the next ones over. Well,” he sighed, “at least they have some closure now.”
“How tragic; I can’t possibly imagine how I’d cope in their situation,” she said. 
He nodded. “I agree.”
“Sherriff, are you sure you wouldn’t like a cup of coffee? It’ll just take a minute to brew.”
“No, Anne, but thanks again for the offer.” He straightened up and patted his pockets, as if searching for his keys. “I’d better get going; my daughter’s expecting me home soon.”
“You have children?” she asked.
He smiled proudly. “A daughter, Celeste. She just graduated.”
“Oh, you’re a single parent?” she asked, smiling as if she’d just won big on a lottery scratch-off. 
Ugh, could she look any more thrilled?
He nodded. “Yes, been single for quite a few years now, in fact.”
“Being a single parent is difficult with normal hours,” she replied quickly. “I could only imagine what you’re going through, with such crazy ones.”
“It’s not too bad. It’s just Celeste, and she’s… fairly manageable. You… you have twins. That must be quite a handful.”
“Not really. They’re pretty good kids.”
He smiled. “Good, then they won’t have to see much of me.”
Mom burst out laughing as if he’d said the funniest thing she’d ever heard.
“Oh, hell, I’m just kidding. Most of the other kids around here are pretty well-behaved, as well.”
“Good, then I can relax when these two start meeting other kids in town and go out at night.”
He tilted his head and leaned forward. “I wouldn’t go that far. They are still teenagers”.
“So very true,” she sighed. “Well, thanks for making it out here so quickly. We were all pretty shaken up.”
His lips thinned. “I’m sure. What a horrible experience for your first night in Shore Lake, too. I’m sorry you had to go through this.”
“So are we,” she said, frowning. “It was certainly an eventful evening. Crazy, huh?”
“I’d say.” He put his hat on. “I’d better get going. I hope the next time we meet it’s under much better circumstances.”
My mom followed him to the door. “Me, too. Goodnight, Sheriff.”
“Caleb,” he said softly, looking down at her.
Her cheeks turned pink. “Goodnight, Caleb.”
It was actually early morning but mom and Caleb didn’t seem to notice. They were too busy staring at each other with their lonely middle-aged hormones. 
“Goodbye, Sheriff,” called Nathan from the couch with a shit-eating grin. Like me, he’d been studying them quietly, and from the look on his face, he also knew they were into each other.
“Yeah, see you,” I added with a wave, hoping he’d just leave, already. 
Caleb smiled once more with his gleaming white teeth and then finally walked out the front door. 
“He’s such a nice man,” said mom, looking into space with a stupid grin. “It’s so refreshing to know this town has a great guy like him patrolling the streets.”
“Oh, you hardly know him,” I snapped, getting off of the sofa. “He might not really be that nice. It could be an act.”
Both my mom and brother stared at me in surprise. 
I raised my chin. “Sorry, but it’s true.”
She shook her head. “Oh for Heaven’s sake, Nikki, don’t be so quick to judge other people.”
I started walking up the steps to my bedroom, ready to fall into that soft pillow-top. “Whatever, I’m going to bed.”
“She’s just being a crab-ass,” said Nathan.
“I heard that!” I hollered.
I knew it was true, though. It had been a long day and I was ready to sleep for the next two.
 

Chapter Four


 
I slept until almost eleven the next morning. Mom was already up, drinking coffee and working on her computer, when I padded downstairs in my bare feet.
“Morning,” I said, pouring some coffee for myself. Normally, I wasn’t a coffee drinker, but I really needed something stronger than orange juice to perk me up. Especially after the last few hours.
“Good morning,” beamed my mother, who was always a morning person no matter how late she stayed up. 
“Where’s Nathan?”  
“He’s outside by the boat. We were thinking about taking it out on the lake within the hour.”
I yawned. “I’ll eat something and get ready.”
“Good.”
I took a drink of coffee and walked over to a large window facing the lake. The skies were blue and it looked like a beautiful day. Then I thought about the dead girl from last night.
“Um, did you really actually find her in the lake?” I asked. The idea of swimming in the lake when there’d been a floating body in it the night before was harrowing. I seriously doubted that I could even put my foot in the water.
“Why?” 
I could tell from her expression that she knew where this was going.
I shrugged. “It’s just kind of gross to think about swimming in it.”
My brother entered the kitchen. “Don’t worry, Nikki, that lake is so freaken big, I’m sure there are plenty of other bodies lost somewhere beneath the surface. People still swim in it all the time.”
I shot him a dirty look. “That’s gross.”  
Mom groaned. “Thanks, Nathan. Listen, people drown and it’s just a fact of life. I’m sure every lake has stories of people disappearing in it, including the ones you’ve swam in the past.”
I walked towards the doorway with my coffee. “That doesn’t make it sound any more enticing. I think I’ll just enjoy the view on the lake and try not to think about what’s under it.”
“Just make sure you’re ready to go in an hour!” hollered Nathan as I stepped out of the kitchen. “Or we’re leaving you behind.”

~~~

An hour-and-a-half later, I’d changed into my new orange and pink bikini, and we were racing across the lake in a twenty-five-foot Stingray. Nathan was grinning from ear to ear, my mom was also smiling and desperately trying to hold her straw sunhat onto her head, but I was still thinking about the girl in the lake. I just couldn’t shake the horror of knowing there’d been a body near the cabin we were now staying. I had to admit, the fact that my mother and brother were able to push it aside was a little disconcerting, too. It was almost like they’d forgotten all about it. 
“This is great!” yelled Nathan over the motor as his light brown hair whipped in the wind. “There’s hardly anyone out here and we have the entire lake to ourselves!”
It was true, but it was also early in the week. From the look of all the boats docked near the shoreline, this place was pretty busy on the weekends.
Nathan slowed down after crossing the entire lake and set the anchor. “Okay, I’m going for a swim,” he said, smiling eagerly.
“Sounds good,” said mom as she pulled out a book from her tote. “You know what I’m going to do – read and work on my tan.”
I handed her some sunscreen. “Not without this. You’ll be a lobster tonight as it is.”
She smiled and began rubbing some of the coconut scented lotion into her skin. 
“Coming in, twerp?” asked Nathan, removing his bright red T-shirt.
“Quit calling me that,” I snarled. “Maybe later I’ll come in and drown you.”
He dove into the dark water. When he surfaced, he yelled, “Wow, it’s really nice! Come on out, Nikki. Don’t be such a wimp!”
The sun was shining, it was already eighty degrees and as I stared at him in the water, I had to admit, it did look very enticing.
I let out a long sigh and stood up. I lifted the white beach dress over my head and dove into the cool water.
“See,” said Nathan when I popped my head back out. “It’s not so bad.”
I wiped some water away from my eyes and smiled. “Yeah, I guess not.” It also didn’t hurt that we were on the other side of the lake from where the girl had been found. For some reason, that comforted me quite a bit.
A small fishing boat was trolling towards us and I strained to see who was driving it, half expecting the sheriff who’d been making eyes at my mom earlier. Even today in her bikini, she’d caught the attention of a couple fishermen we’d passed by on the lake. Heck, I couldn’t deny the fact that she looked pretty fit for someone reaching forty.
“Hey,” shouted Nathan at the young man who stopped his boat next to ours. “How’s it going?”
The dark-haired guy looked about our age, maybe a little older. He was wearing black sunglasses and blue-and-white striped swim trunks. “Pretty good. Nice boat!” he hollered back.
Nathan smiled. “It’s not ours, but thanks.”
The stranger removed his sunglasses and returned the smile. “I’m Duncan. You guys vacationing out here?”
“No,” answered mom. “We’re renting a cabin on the other side of the lake.”
He nodded. “There are more than enough cabins available on this lake, that’s for sure.”
“Really? Why is that?” I asked.
He stared at me for a minute and then said, “I just meant that some of these cabins are only seasonal homes, so many of the owners rent them out during the year when they’re not in use.”
“Oh,” I replied.
“I’m Anne, but the way,” said mom. “And those two in the water are Nikki and Nathan.”
“Nice meeting you all.”
“You too,” replied Nathan. 
 “Do you live on the lake then, Duncan?” she asked.
He nodded. “I live with my dad on the north side of the lake. He owns the boat repair shop over there, and our place is right next to it.”
“Cool,” said Nathan. “I suppose you get to see a lot of nice boats coming through there.”
 “Definitely, my dad’s is the only repair shop nearby, so he’s pretty busy, even with my help. Because the lake is so big and there’s money on it, we definitely get some nice little yachts coming in for repairs.” 
I swam back over to our boat and climbed up the steps while Nathan and Duncan continued talking boats. As mom handed me a towel, I noticed Duncan stealing glances my way. When our eyes suddenly met, he quickly looked away.
“So, what do you guys do for fun here, other than fishing?” asked Nathan.
Duncan cleared his throat. “Actually, the town is having their annual end of summer barbeque this weekend at Turtle Beach. It’s on the northern side of the lake, too. I’m sure they’ll have tons of food and games. Then, at night they’ll launch the fireworks. They do it every year.”
“We’d better not miss that shindig,” smiled my mom. 
He nodded. “It’s a pretty big deal. Almost everyone in town will be there.”
“Will you be there?” I blurted out unexpectedly. I surprised everyone, even myself.
Duncan stared at me for a moment and smiled. “I wasn’t planning on it, but it’s starting to sound more interesting.” 
I could feel my face burning and it wasn’t from the sun. “I, um... I just think it would be nice for Nathan to have someone to hang out with. He gets so bored, sometimes… ”
“She’s right,” replied Nathan, grinning widely at me, as if he knew I was back-peddling. “I need a friend. I’m just so bored out of my mind now that we’re in a new town and I have no friends to raise hell with.”
He laughed. “I don’t know much about raising hell, but if you’re bored, you should stop by the shop later today. We just took in this mint Bluewater yacht that is incredible. I might even know someone with the keys who could give you a private tour.”
“Sweet! I might have to take you up on that,” said Nathan, his face brightening. 
Just then, a couple flew by us on a pair of jet-skis and Duncan turned to watch them, giving me another opportunity to check him out. I had to admit that he was not only cute, but had nicely-sculpted pecs and arms. It was obvious that he worked his muscles when he wasn’t working on boats. Before I had a chance to look away he turned back around and caught me staring. I immediately looked away, hoping my face wasn’t as red as Nathan’s trunks.
“What’s wrong, Nikki?” asked mom, an amused expression on her face. “You feeling a little flushed?”
“No,” I answered, a little too sharply.
“Oh. Okay.”
“Your face is a little red,” said Nathan, pointing to his cheek. He grinned. “Better use some sunscreen.”
I shot him an angry look and he turned away, chuckling.
 “I suppose I should get back to the marina. By the way, you ladies are invited, too, of course,” said Duncan.  
I looked up. “Okay.”
“Thanks,” said mom, “but maybe another time. I have too much to do this afternoon.”
“No problem. I’ll be around the shop all evening. Hope to see you there,” said Duncan, his eyes drifting back to me again. Then he started the engine and was gone. 
“That’s cool,” said Nathan as he got back on the boat after Duncan left. “Now I can check out some nice boats while Nikki checks out Duncan.”
“Very funny.”
He smiled. “Come on, I saw the way you were drooling over him!”
“I was not!” I retorted, scowling at him. “I was just checking his boat out.”
He threw his head back and laughed. “Right! Since when do you have an interest in boats?”
“I always have.”
My mom smiled and added her two cents. “Actually, I also noticed that you were checking out more than the boat.”
“Whatever. You guys are seeing things. Anyway, you both should talk, what, about that redhead in the parking lot yesterday, and… Sheriff White Strips?”
My mom looked confused. “Sheriff White Strips?”
Nathan nodded. “Yeah, Caleb.  His teeth were whiter than your pasty skin, mom. Bleached white.”
She snorted. “You’re funny.”
“Sorry, couldn’t resist,” replied Nathan as he started the engine. He grabbed his bottle of water and took a swig. “I say we go back to the cabin now, I’m starving.”
“Sounds good,” she replied. “I’ve got plenty to do.”
Nathan set his water in the cup-holder, turned on the engine, and we started back across the lake. A few seconds later, he grinned like a little kid and told us to hold on. 
I grabbed the handle next to my seat right as he punched it down and we took off across the lake. I squealed in delight as we sped over the calm waters, the wind practically blowing my hair dry as we flew. Soon, we were near our neck of the woods and I pulled my beach-dress back over my bathing suit. As we slowed down, I noticed a middle-aged woman sitting on her dock, fishing. She smiled and raised her hand in greeting.
“Must be our neighbor,” said mom, waving back. “Ernie mentioned that she was recently widowed. I think he said her name was Abigail. Very nice woman, I guess. Maybe it would be a good idea if I stopped by later and said hello.”
I stared at the woman and nodded. “I would. She’s probably sad and lonely.”
She nodded. “I’m sure.”
Nathan docked the boat near the end of the dock and we helped him secure it to the posts.  
“That should be good enough for now,” he said, testing the ropes. “I’ll leave it out here in case we want to take it out again, later.”
I stood up and looked down into the brown water. “So, um, it must be pretty deep, right here.”
 “Yeah,” replied Nathan, grabbing his shirt from the boat. “That’s why they built the dock this distance from the shore. It’s safer for the boat if the lake ever gets low.”
The water was so murky looking and I wondered if there were any more dead bodies below. I imagined someone’s dead eyes staring up at me from below the surface and started to feel sick to my stomach.
“I’ll meet you guys on shore,” I said, getting up quickly. 
“Are you okay?” called my mom.
“Just a little too much sun,” I shouted back as I raced towards the cabin, feeling dizzy and anxious. As I passed the area where the body was found, I averted my eyes and tried not to panic any worse than I already was. When I made it to the cabin’s porch, I closed my eyes and took a couple deep breaths.
“Hey,” said my brother as he climbed the steps a minute later. 
I smiled weakly.
He stared at me with concern. “You’re really freaked out about that girl, aren’t you?”
“Well, yeah. Aren’t you?”
He sighed. “I’m trying to forget about it. She made a huge mistake when she started drinking that night, and hopefully her friends have learned from it. But I’m not going to dwell on it, and neither should you. Heck, you didn’t even see the girl, I discovered her. I should be the one freaking out about it.”
I nodded. “I know. It’s just so… creepy.”
He put an arm around my shoulder. “It is, but you have to let it go. Or mom will send you to a shrink, which, actually, she should have done a long time ago.”
I pushed him away. “Ha-ha.”
She met us on the porch and took out her keys. “Whew, it’s getting hot out here. Thank goodness for air conditioning.”
“Summer’s almost over, mom. Then you’ll be complaining about the cold. In fact, I’ve read that it gets very cold here,” I said.
“That’s when the fireplace will come in handy,” she replied.
Nathan put the boat keys on one of the end tables. “Nikki, go get dressed and we’ll drive into town to check it out. I need to start looking for a job, too.”
“Okay,” I replied. I’d worked at a boutique back home and my savings was starting to dwindle. I wanted my own car soon so I didn’t have to rely on Nathan all the time.
“Then we’ll go check out your boyfriend’s boat repair shop,” he said with a smirk.
“You’re just full of jokes today.”
Just then, mom, who’d been checking her voicemail, started smiling. She hung up the phone and stared at us. “Guess who asked me to dinner?”
I groaned. “Sheriff Snaggletooth?”
She frowned. “That’s not fair, Nikki. Like I said before, he seems like a very nice man.”
“You going for it?” asked Nathan, with a shit-eating grin.
She tapped her fingers on the banister. “Oh, I don’t know. I’m not looking for anything right now, obviously, but it never hurts to get in good with a town’s sheriff. Maybe I’ll just invite him over to our house tonight for dinner. Can you pick up a couple of steaks in town, Nathan?”
He nodded. “But if you want wine, you’ll have to get that yourself.”
She snorted. “That’s the last thing I need, to get tipsy in front of the town’s sheriff.”
Nathan smiled wickedly. “It might be fun. He can handcuff you if you get too out of hand.” 
Her eyes lit up. “Oh, I never thought of that.”
“You’re sick,” I said, climbing the staircase. “Both of you.”
“Oh, Nikki, I can’t wait until the love bug nips you in the butt. I am going to tease the crap out of you,” she said.
“Don’t hold your breath. That’s not happening anytime soon,” I said.
“We’ll see,” she said.
“Be ready in thirty minutes, twerp,” called Nathan. “We’ll go cruising.”

Chapter Five


I took a quick shower and changed into a dark blue halter sundress and white sandals. I pulled my hair into a loose up-do and applied a smidgeon of lip gloss. 
“You look pretty,” smiled mom as I entered the kitchen, looking for Nathan.
I looked down at my dress and shrugged. “Oh, it was one of the few things already unpacked.”
She gave me a knowing smile and kissed the top of my head. “Don’t break too many hearts in town.” 
“Ha-ha, mom. Very funny,” I said, although I did feel sort of pretty in the new dress. It also wouldn’t hurt to make a good impression on any kids who were hanging out in town.
Nathan was polishing up his Mustang when I found him outside. The red paint gleamed in the sun when he was finished.
“Now I’ll definitely be a chic magnet,” he teased, flexing his muscles. “Don’t take offense if I ask you to duck down when the ladies are scoping me out.”
I rolled my eyes. “Right.” 
“You’ll see.”
I got into the car and we took our time driving back into town.
“Hear from Deanna yet today?” I asked.
He grimaced. “Yeah. She called freaking out, again. I just don’t know what to do about her. I mean, the more I think about it, the more I realize that I’m tired of the drama. Then I look at this town we’ve moved to and I think about all of the possibilities.”
I smiled. “You mean all of the chicks?”
“Hell yeah,” he laughed.
I shook my head at my brother, who was so predictable. 
“Okay, keep your eyes peeled for something interesting,” said Nathan, brushing his bangs away from his eyes. “Both of us need jobs.”
As we entered the town I pointed right away to a diner called ‘Ruth’s.’ “Let’s stop in there and see if they’re hiring.” 
“Good idea. I’m hungry again, anyway.”
We were seated by a frazzled-looking waitress who appeared to be one of only two working. It was only three in the afternoon, but the place was packed. 
“You wouldn’t be hiring, would you?” I asked the other waitress, Amy, a blond with light blue eyes and an easy smile.
“Actually, funny you should ask, we’re hiring for the nightshift,” she said. “We’re always hiring for that shift, so I guess it really isn’t funny.”
“That’s fine. I’m desperately broke and need a job. Could you please get me an application?” I asked. “Oh, and,” I handed her back the menu.  “A Caesar salad?” I pointed to Nathan. “He’s buying.”
She laughed. “Okay, so anything to drink?”
“Just water,” I replied.
“How are the burgers here, Amy?” asked Nathan.
“Oh, they’re very good. That’s why this place is always so busy. That and the fact that we’re the only diner open twenty-four hours.”
He smiled. “I’ll take your word for it, then. I’d like a bacon double cheeseburger, an order of onion rings, and a chocolate milkshake.”
She smiled back. “Hope you’re hungry because they serve big portions here.”
That’s when Nathan turned on the charm. He leaned forward and smiled. “You know what… I already like this place, sis. Nice portions and even nicer waitresses. What more could a guy ask for?”
Amy blushed. She was very pretty and I’m sure that guys were always coming on to her, but even I had to admit, Nathan was a good-looking guy himself. Obviously, he knew it, too.
“I’ll be back with your malt and water in just a moment,” she said softly before she walked away.
“I guess Deanna is beginning to fade from your memory as the day progresses,” I mused.
His face became serious. “Not really. I mean, there will always be a special place in my heart for her, but, I’ve decided to keep my options open. Heck, I’m young and shouldn’t be tying myself down to one girl; especially one who’s a few hundred miles away.”
I folded my hands and nodded. “That’s why I’m not going to waste time pining for any of the guys in town. After high school there will be college, and I don’t want anything holding me back.”
Amy returned with his milkshake and handed me an application.
“Um, if I were you I’d only request hours during the day or early evening.”
 “Why?” I asked, puzzled.
She looked around nervously and then whispered, “It’s too dangerous around here at night.”
Nathan raised his eyebrows. “What do you mean by dangerous?”
“Amy!” hollered someone behind the counter, who looked like the cook. “Order’s up! They’re waiting!”
“Sorry, I can’t talk about it now,” she mumbled. “Just take my word for it.”
Then she left us both staring at each other in surprise.
I bit the side of my lower lip. “Wow, first a dead body in the lake and now this creepy warning?”
He waved his hand. “Oh, it might be nothing. Maybe she’s talking about drunk drivers or something.”
“I don’t know, but, I’ll take her word for it. I’d prefer to work during the day, anyway.”
I finished the application just as our food arrived. 
“I can take this and give it to the owner if you’d like. She’ll be in later this evening,” said Amy.
“Thanks,” I said. “So, what did you mean earlier about it being dangerous around here at night?”
Her eyes darted around the restaurant again and I had this feeling like she was genuinely scared. Finally she cleared her throat and mumbled. “I didn’t mean anything by it. Just forget I said anything.”
At that moment I noticed that the diner was unusually quiet and I had the impression that some of the other customers were listening to our conversation. I decided it would be best just to drop the subject.
I raised my voice. “Oh. Well, yeah, if you could give the application to whoever does the hiring, I’d really appreciate it.” 
She nodded and then stepped away. I immediately noticed that the volume of the diner rose again and I stared at Nathan curiously.
“Okay, kind of weird,” he said, under his breath. “Must be a small town thing?”
“Must be,” I said, picking up my fork.
We finished our food and Nathan left a big tip for Amy, who was so busy she could barely make it back to the table, to refill our glasses. 
“You dropped something,” called Amy as we were leaving the diner. Before I could respond, she handed me a folded-up note and hurried away. 
“What was that all about?” asked Nathan as we walked to the car.”
The sun was bright and I put my shades on. “Don’t know. We’ll read it in the car.”
When we got into the Mustang, I immediately opened the note and read it out loud. “Lock your doors at night and don’t invite any strangers inside.” A shiver ran up my spine and I turned to Nathan. “Okay, that’s really freaky.”
Nathan’s cell phone began to ring before he could respond. “It’s mom,” he said, answering it.
I could hear them talking about her date with the sheriff and then he hung up.
“I guess it’s going to be a late dinner, so we don’t have to be home for a few hours. The sheriff is working a little later and isn’t getting off until sometime after nine.”
I snorted. “If it’s dangerous here at night, it would make sense that he’s really busy.”
“Listen,” said Nathan, as we pulled out of the parking lot. “I wouldn’t go blowing everything out of proportion. It’s possible that Amy was friends with that dead girl and doesn’t trust anyone right now. Or maybe, she’s a little crazy.”
I sighed. “Or maybe, she’s just worried about us. You have to admit that finding a dead body practically at our doorstep isn’t the best housewarming gift.”
“Since the sheriff is coming to dinner tonight, why don’t we just ask him about it? He’d certainly know if there was something wicked happening around here after dark.”
“Maybe,” I mumbled. 
“Hey, that must be Duncan’s dad’s shop,” said Nathan, slowing the car down. 
I looked up and noticed a large boat marina with a big sign that read: “Sonny’s Boat Repairs.” Nathan pulled into the parking lot and we both got out.
“Wow, check out all of those boats,” pointed Nathan, his face lighting up. “Oh man, I think I just had an orgasm.”
I glared at him. “God, you are so disgusting.”
There was a fenced-in storage area for some of the smaller boats not docked at the marina. On the other side was the repair shop. 
“I’d like to get myself an old Carver after I find a job,” said Nathan as we walked towards the shop’s entrance. “I hear you can get one relatively inexpensive and fix it up.” 
Nathan and my dad have always loved boats. In fact, we used to own a twenty-four foot Bayliner before my parents split up. Then dad had to sell the boat and Nathan’s been pining for his own ever since.
“Hey!” called Duncan, coming towards us. “You made it.”
“Yeah,” said Nathan. “Now that we’re here, I have to admit, I’m jealous. You’re surrounded by some pretty amazing boats.”
Duncan started telling us about another high-end yacht that needed repairs. I have to admit, though, I was paying more attention to him than what he was saying. Up close, he appeared much taller than I’d remembered and had a contagious smile. His eyes were a silvery gray color, and every time he glanced my way, I felt my cheeks heat up.
“I just realized something,” he said. “You’re twins, aren’t you?”
“Yeah,” said Nathan, putting his arm around my shoulders. “She’s the ugly one, poor little thing.”
My jaw dropped and I smacked him in the shoulder for what had to be the tenth time that day. “You are such a shit.”
“But I’m the good-looking one,” he laughed.
Duncan shook his head and stared at us in amusement. “Sorry, dude, but I think you might have that wrong. Nikki here seems to have absorbed all the beauty genes, leaving you with a great sense of humor, though.” 
“Oh, yeah,” I laughed, secretly thrilled that Duncan thought I was cute, “and even his sense of humor leaves a lot to be desired.” 
Nathan pouted. “And I thought you invited me along because I was the cuter twin.”
“No, but I have to say, you still have a nice butt,” joked Duncan.
“Pilates,” said Nathan, turning around to show us.
“Okay, enough!” I interrupted. “Now I’ve realized that you are both a couple of dorks.”
“From one dork to another,” said Nathan. “I’m ready to see some yachts. Lead the way, you sexy thang.”
Duncan burst out laughing and turned around to lead us towards the marina. I quickly checked out his rear and decided that he definitely didn’t need any Pilates.
 

Chapter Six
 
An hour later, after getting a few secret tours on some of the largest yachts I’d ever seen, we followed Duncan into the main shop to meet his dad, Sonny.
“Hello,” said Sonny, who was an older version of Duncan, minus the hair, “nice to meet the both of you.”
Nathan held out his hand and shook Sonny’s. “Thanks for letting Duncan give us a glimpse of some of these sweet yachts,” he said. “You must be extremely busy with all of those boats out there.”
“Tell me about it,” said Sonny. “I can barely keep up. I’m going to have to hire someone to help around the shop, especially now that fall is just around the corner. Many of these boats need to be winterized, and soon.”
I looked at Nathan, who was already way ahead of me. 
“What kind of experience do you need? I’m looking for a job,” said my brother.
Sonny rubbed his bald head. “I can’t imagine you’d know how to repair boat engines at your age, although Duncan does, but that’s because he’s been around them most his life. You know, I could still use someone to take care of the customers, order parts, and do some of the lighter maintenance. That would free up a lot of time for me and my son.”
I could see that Nathan was getting really excited. “Listen,” he said, his eyes sparkling. “I’m your man. I’m a very hard worker and learn quickly.”
Sonny leaned back in his chair. “Okay. We’ll have you fill out an application and I’ll certainly consider you. I do have a couple mechanics who work the graveyard shift, so what I could really use is someone who doesn’t mind doing a little grunt work.”
“Grunt is my middle name,” smiled Nathan.
Sonny smiled. “That’s what I like to hear.”
While Nathan started filling out the application, Duncan asked me if I wanted anything to drink.
“Um, sure... water?”
“Come on, I’ll show you our luxurious break room.”
I followed Duncan to the back of the shop and we entered into a small room with pop and snack machines. 
“Here,” he said, handing me a bottle of water from the back of the fridge. “I’ll give you one from my secret stash. If I don’t hide them, they seem to disappear overnight.”
I laughed. “Really? Thanks.”
“So,” he said as he sat down and stretched out his long legs. “How do you like Shore Lake so far?”
“Seriously, it’s kind of a hard question to answer. Last night we found a body near the lake, and today, one of the waitresses at Ruth’s passed me a note that warned us to stay inside after dark and not invite any strangers inside.”
His eyes widened. “Seriously?! Are you kidding me?”
I took a sip of the water. “No, I wish I was.” I set my water down and pulled out the note Amy had given me.
He read it and frowned. “Very strange. So, do the cops know whose body you found?”
“Some girl around my age, Tina Johnson?”
He scratched his head. “Tina Johnson? To tell you the truth, I don’t really know many of the locals. I only stay with my dad during the summer and then for the rest of the year, I live with my mom in Minnesota.”
“Oh, so you’re going back to Minnesota next month when school starts?”
He smiled. “I graduated last spring, so now I can stay wherever I want.”
“What are you going to do now?” I asked.
He sighed. “Probably help my dad out while I take some engineering classes at the local college.”
“What about your mom?”
“She just remarried and is pretty busy with her new husband,” he said. “My dad doesn’t really have anyone else but me, so I’m probably sticking around here.”
I took a sip of water and set it down. “Well, it sounds like your dad really needs you in more ways than one.”
He nodded. “What about your old man?” he asked and then looked embarrassed. “I’m sorry, I probably shouldn’t have asked. If he’s passed away or something, I apologize for my lack of tactfulness.”
I smiled humorlessly. “Actually, there are times that I wish he had passed away. I know that sounds really cold, but he’s an asshole. Thank goodness my mom is no longer with him.”
“Then cheers to that,” he said, tapping my water bottle with his.
“Cheers.”
He re-capped his water. “So, you mentioned the dead girl, do they think she was murdered?”
“No, it sounds like she liked to party a little too much and may have accidently killed herself.”
“What about the waitress at the diner?” he asked, biting his lower lip. “That was a pretty weird.”
“Very.” I sat back in the chair. “So, um, have you heard anything about missing people or other bodies being discovered near the lake?”
He looked thoughtful. “No, not really; although, there have been plenty of people moving recently. That’s why I mentioned the cabins. Either people are selling or just renting out their lake homes.”
“Hey, Nikki,” said Nathan as he stepped into the break room, “are you ready to get going? I want to pick up those steaks for mom before it gets too late.”
I looked at my watch and noticed it was already after seven. “Yeah, we’d better leave.”
“Thanks for stopping by, guys,” said Duncan, standing up. He lowered his voice. “I’ll work on my dad so he’ll hire you.”
Nathan laughed. “Sounds good. I’ll give you a call in a couple of days if I don’t hear from him, to see what’s going on. If anything, we can go cruising.”
“Definitely. And don’t forget about the barbeque this weekend,” said Duncan. “Now that Nikki’s practically begged me to be your date, Nathan.”
Nathan’s eyes widened innocently. “Oh, what ever will I wear?” he asked, standing kind of prissy. “Do you like pink, Duncan?”
Duncan looked at my dress and then winked.  “Actually, I prefer blue.”
 

Chapter Seven


It was dark by the time we made it home and mom was on the deck, desperately trying to figure out the grill.
“Step aside before you blow us all up,” ordered Nathan, handing her the package of steaks.
“No arguments here,” she answered. “I prefer cooking on the stove myself, but the steaks taste so much better on the grill. Thanks for picking them up, by the way.”
“No problem. Just don’t give the sheriff mine, it’s the thirty-ouncer,” he replied. 
“Of course not, you bottomless pit,” she said. “But we’re also having potatoes, pasta salad, and corn on the cob. So pace yourself tonight, if you can.”
He snorted. “That’s it? No dessert?”
“Cheesecake,” she said. “But let’s make sure our guest gets a piece before you get your mitts on it.”
“You should have made two, and then you wouldn’t have to worry about it,” he joked.
She raised her finger. “I’m not going to worry about it because you’re going to wait until everyone else has had a piece before you devour the rest.”
“Okay, I can live with that.”
“You look nice,” I told her. She was wearing a lilac colored blouse and a new white skirt I’d never seen before. 
“Thanks,” she smiled. “So, how was your trip into town?” 
“It started out a little strange but got better,” I answered.
“What do you mean?”
Nathan interrupted. “Oh, she applied for a job at the local diner and some waitress slipped her a note with an ominous warning.”
“What?”
I showed her the piece of paper and she shrugged. “That is pretty odd. Maybe she knew the deceased girl? Who knows, she may think there was foul play involved.”
“Maybe there was,” I said.
She frowned. “The sheriff didn’t seem to think so. We’ll ask him about it again when he gets here.”
“Okay,” I said, putting the note away. I didn’t think he’d tell us much, however. Having a father for a cop taught me that they weren’t keen on divulging information like that. 
“So, did you guys make it to Duncan’s boat shop?”
“Yeah,” said Nathan. “And his dad is hiring for shop help, so I filled out an application.”
Her eyes widened. “Wow, that means both of you might have jobs before the end of the summer? That’s amazing!”
“Yeah, I know. I need money and a car, badly,” I said. 
“If you get a job, I’ll help you find a car and you can pay me back in installments. But, don’t expect anything fancy,” she said.
“Seriously? Thanks, mom,” I replied, throwing my arms around her. I’d never owned my own car before, although I had my license. I started thinking about all of the possibilities and became giddy.
“You bet. I know it’s tough not having a car; especially, now that you’ll be a senior.”
As I pulled away, my eyes caught a movement in the woods. At first, I thought it was a deer or some other wild animal, but then in a blur, it shot up into the trees. I wasn’t sure, but I could have sworn its eyes were glowing, too. Just like the so-called “Peeping Tom.”
“Something’s in the woods,” I whispered hoarsely.  
“What?” asked my mother.
Nathan stepped off the deck and began walking slowly towards the trees.
“What the hell are you doing?” barked mom.
He raised his hand. “Calm down. It’s probably just a deer or something.”
I pointed up towards the top of the trees. “It flew up there, and I doubt it was a reindeer.”
My mom released a heavy sigh. “Then it was just a bird. Don’t scare me like that.”
I shook my head, vehemently. “No, it wasn’t a bird.”
Nathan walked back onto the deck. “Of course it was a bird. Or maybe a flying squirrel.”
I put my hands on my waist. “It wasn’t a small animal, okay? It was big! Bigger than you,” I told him.
“The shadow probably looked a lot larger than the animal. When it’s dark like this, your eyes can play tricks on you. Think about it, nothing my size would be able to fly up into a tree,” he said. “It’s not possible.”
“I know what I saw,” I snapped, glaring at him, “and it was big. I’m going into the cabin. This place is really starting to give me the creeps.”
“It’s been a long day,” said my mom, as I opened the patio door. “Caleb should be here in another hour. If you’re hungry, Nikki, eat some of that pasta salad I made. It’s in the refrigerator. Oh, and put these steaks in there too, will you?”
She handed them to me and my stomach started rumbling as I went into the kitchen.  Although I was still freaked out about the flying shadow, I was also starving, as I hadn’t eaten anything since my salad at the diner earlier. 
I opened up the refrigerator and took out the large bowl of pasta, setting it on the counter. As I began scooping out some of the salad, the hair on the back of my neck stood straight up. I raised my eyes to the window facing me and let out a bloodcurdling scream. A pale face was staring at me through the glass. It disappeared quickly and I leaped away from the window in terror.
“What’s wrong?” hollered my brother, rushing into the kitchen.
“Someone was watching me,” I choked, pointing towards the window. “Through there!”
He stared at my frightened face then grabbed a butcher knife from the block.
“What are you planning on doing with that?” cried mom, entering the kitchen.
“Nikki thinks there’s someone out there.” He raised the knife. “If there is someone, I’m not going unarmed.”
Just then the doorbell rang, startling us all. 
“I’ll get it,” said mom. “Hopefully it’s the sheriff and he can take a look around outside.”
We followed her to the front door and she swung it open.
“Hello,” smiled Caleb, holding out two bottles of wine, a red and a white. “I wasn’t sure if you were a wine drinker or not. I brought red and white, just in case.”
“Thank God you’re here,” she said, grabbing a bottle of wine and pulling him through the door. “Nikki thinks someone is lurking around outside.”
“Think?” I snapped. “I know there is. Someone was in the woods watching all of us, and then a face stared at me through the window.”
Caleb was dressed in civilian clothing, jeans and a white polo shirt, but he reached down by his ankle and pulled out a gun. “Okay, I’ll go take a look. You guys stay inside and lock your doors.”
“Mom, I’m seriously really scared,” I said, as she locked the door. “What the hell is going on around here?”
She walked over and hugged me. “Don’t worry, it’ll be fine.”
“What if it’s dad?” said Nathan, his face pale. “What if he’s found us and is trying to scare the shit out of us?”
“Oh, hell, I never even considered that,” said mom, looking quite troubled, herself. “I hope not.”
“Would he do that?” I asked.
She shrugged. “I don’t know. The law is after him now. He might do anything. I can’t imagine how he found out where we were staying, though. The only person who knew was Ernie.”
“I think you should call Ernie and make sure he’s okay,” said Nathan. 
She moved towards the phone, her face white. “I’ll call him right now.”
There was a loud knock at the door. “It’s me. Let me in. Everything’s okay,” called Caleb.
Mom put down the phone and rushed to the door. “Did you find anything?” she asked, when he stepped inside.
He smiled. “Actually, I found a couple of raccoons outside that were looking pretty mischievous. I didn’t find anything else out of the ordinary, though.”
“Um, did you see footprints by any of the kitchen windows, or any prints?” asked Nathan. 
He bit back a smile. “I didn’t see much, I’m sorry. But I really don’t think there’s anyone out there.”
“I know what I saw, and it was a human face, staring at me through the kitchen window,” I said. “It freaked the crap out of me.”
His eyebrows shot up. “Okay, what did this person look like?”  
I sighed. “It was hard to tell, it happened so fast.”
“If you couldn’t really tell, then it’s quite possible that you saw an animal,” said Caleb, walking towards the window. He lifted one of the blinds and peered outside. “There are a lot of those in these woods.”
“It moved so quickly, I couldn’t tell if it was a man or woman, but it definitely wasn’t an animal. I’m sure of that,” I said
He released the blind and walked back over to us. “I can look around again, if it makes you feel better.”
“Thank you, Caleb,” interrupted my mom. “This family has been through so much that it would really be comforting if you could do that for us.”
He nodded slowly. “Okay, I understand. I’ll be back in a few minutes.”
“Thank you,” I said, as he walked back towards the door.
“No problem. If it’s going to calm everyone down, I’ll be happy to do it.”
“I told you he was a nice man,” said mom after he left the cabin again.
Even I had to admit, it was almost comforting having him around. Almost.
Caleb took much longer this time, but when he returned, he still hadn’t discovered anything unusual.
“Thank you for doing that, Caleb,” said my mother, handing him a glass of red wine. “You could probably use a little of this right now.”
“I thought you’d never ask,” he answered with a lopsided grin. “Although I’d better not overindulge; I hear the cops in this area are pretty wicked.”
She giggled and then turned to Nathan. “Honey, can you fire up the grill? I’m sure everyone is starving by now.”
“Yeah, I’m fading away,” said Nathan, raising his hands in front of his face. “I can barely see my hands.”
Mom smiled and shook her head. Then she turned to me. “Nikki? Honey, why don’t you go upstairs and rest for a little while. I’ll fix you a plate of food and bring it up later, if you don’t feel like coming back down.”
I glanced at Caleb, who was staring at my mother like she was a filet mignon. I knew right then that it was time to make an exit. 
“Okay, I need to change anyway,” I said, getting off the couch. As I left, I could hear them talking and wanted to puke at the way she was flirting with the sheriff. It wasn’t that I didn’t like Caleb; I just didn’t think she was ready to start anything after what just happened.
I raced upstairs to my bedroom, still feeling tense. The gnawing feeling of dread in the pit of my stomach was driving me crazy and I just wanted to go back to my old home in San Diego.   
Feeling helpless, I kept the lights off and changed into a pair of shorts and a T-shirt, keeping my attention on the balcony window. When I finished, I grabbed my bat and slowly walked over to the glass and worked up the nerve to look down below. I half expected to see some kind of ghoul lurking around in the darkness. Nothing appeared out of the ordinary, however, which still wasn’t enough to calm my nerves. 
“What are you doing?” whispered Nathan next to my ear.
“Holy crap! Don’t you ever freak me out like that again!” I snapped. “You almost gave me a fucking heart attack!”
“Wow, I’m sorry. Just settle down, will you?”
I rubbed the beads of sweat from my forehead and then looked at him. “I don’t care what the sheriff says, I saw someone out there watching me in the kitchen.”
He sighed. “I’m not sure what you saw, either, but what I do know is that ever since we found that girl’s body, you’ve been going crazy. I mean, isn’t it possible that you saw a raccoon staring at you in the window? You said so yourself, you couldn’t even see the face very well.”
“I can tell the difference between a raccoon’s face and a person’s, Nathan. I’m not a complete moron,” I said, glancing through the window again. 
We both stared outside in silence for a while. 
“Maybe it really is dad, then,” he said softly. “He might be trying to frighten her or all of us.”
“I don’t know. It just doesn’t feel right. Dad had major anger issues, but he doesn’t seem the type of person who’d waste his time doing this kind of thing. In fact, he’s probably hiding on the other side of the world by now with the help of some of his cop friends.”
“Maybe,” said Nathan. 
I yawned. “I guess I’m going to bed. I lost my appetite anyway. Could you tell mom? I don’t really want to go back down there. It’s nauseating.”
He chuckled. “Okay, Nik, if you need us, just holler.”
“Oh, you’ll hear me. Count on that.”
After he left, I turned on the television and watched a movie about a girl who’d fallen in love with both a vampire and a werewolf. I’d already seen it a million times, so my eyelids grew heavy fairly quickly. Ten minutes later I was out cold in my bed and dreaming of Duncan, who turned into a werewolf and was trying to kill my own vampire boyfriend. Every time I tried to see the vampire’s face, however, it was a blur.
 

Chapter Eight


Mom was still sleeping when I woke the next morning, which was pretty odd, considering it was after ten and she never usually slept past eight.
“Hey,” I said to Nathan, who was eating a monstrous bowl of cereal and watching television at the kitchen counter.
He smirked. “It lives.”
“Very funny, butthead,” I answered.
“Just kidding, twerp,” he replied with his mouth full. “Hey, guess who called for you this morning?”
Duncan? “Who?”
“The manager at that diner you put in an application for.”
I stared at him in surprise. “Wow, really?”
“Yeah, you’re supposed to call her back if you’re still interested in setting up an interview. Here,” he said, handing me a slip of paper, “call Rosie at that number.”
“Awesome,” I said, grinning from ear to ear.  
Ten minutes later I had an interview set up for later that afternoon.
“Wow, that was fast,” said Nathan. “I guess I’ll have to give you a ride.”
“Or, you could just loan me your car.”
He snorted. “Right. Nobody drives that car but me. Not even Deanna got the privilege of driving my baby.”
“Hi, kids,” yawned mom as she shuffled into the kitchen. 
“You were up late,” said Nathan.
She turned on the Keurig and smiled. “Well, Caleb’s an interesting man. He’s traveled all over the world and we talked for hours about his crazy adventures.”
“Small town sheriff-slash-traveler extraordinaire, huh?” smirked Nathan.
Her eyes lit up. “He’s been to so many places, it’s amazing.”
“Oh, shoot,” I said. “Speaking of Caleb, I forgot to tell him about the note I received from the waitress yesterday.”
Mom waved her hand. “Oh, I mentioned it to him and he didn’t seem too concerned. He said this town has had its share of crimes, but there certainly wasn’t anything to be afraid of, even in the dark. He also mentioned that Amy was having a hard time getting over the loss of her friend, the one we found. It’s made her a little… unstable.”
I narrowed my eyes. “What do you mean, unstable?”
She sighed. “I’m not supposed to talk about this, but, she tried to commit suicide a couple weeks ago.”
“Wow,” replied Nathan. “That’s rough.”
Mom nodded. “I guess her parents have been trying frantically to get her help, even going as far as putting her on antidepressants, but obviously, she still has some emotional issues.”
“And Caleb knows all about this?” I asked.
She poured some cream into her coffee. “Yeah, his daughter, Celeste went to school with Amy. They both graduated in June.”
“Oh,” I said.
“How did you sleep last night?” she asked me.
“Fine, although, I had some disturbing dreams. Other than that, I slept pretty well.”
“Holy crap,” interrupted Nathan. He turned up the volume on the television and I stared at it in horror. A picture of the waitress who’d served us yesterday flashed across the screen.
“Seventeen-year-old Amy Kreger was found in the woods near Lake Shore, early this morning,” said the female reporter, standing next to an old Chevy Camaro. “Her car had been found abandoned by the side of the road with drug paraphernalia sitting openly on the front seat. When police officers were called to investigate, they found the deceased in the woods with self-inflicted wounds on both wrists. Tragically, this young girl was close friends with Tina Johnson, who went missing a few weeks ago. Tina’s body was found just two days ago, washed up onshore in an undisclosed location. Police officials do not suspect foul play in either case.”   
Nathan turned off the television and we all stared at each other in shock.
I cleared my throat. “No foul play in either case? Seems unlikely now, doesn’t it?
“Maybe it’s just two very disturbed girls,” replied Nathan.
Mom shook her head sadly. “That poor girl. Her parents must be devastated.” 
“She was so pretty, too,” said Nathan. “It just goes to show that you can’t judge people by what’s on the outside. Amy must have been pretty messed up.”
I stood up. “Did it ever occur to you that maybe she wasn’t messed up?”
“Nikki…” said my mom.
“They found drugs in her car. Obviously, she had issues,” said Nathan.
“Whatever, I’m going to lie down in my room for a while,” I said. “This is nuts.”
I went upstairs and took out the note Amy had given me. It gave me the chills to know that she was now dead. 
“Hey,” said Nathan from my doorway. “I’m taking the boat out in an hour if you want to get some fresh air and clear your head.”
I nodded. “Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. Is mom coming?”
He shook his head. “No, she’s going into town to talk with her new boss. I guess she’s starting work on Monday.”
“Okay. I’ll be down in an hour.”
He left and I took a quick shower, still thinking about Amy and the face in the window last night. I wasn’t sure at this point which was more disturbing. I knew one thing, however; I was going to try and talk mom out of staying here. Something was going on in this town. I wasn’t sure if it was just one crazy freak or a group of them. What I did know was that there were two dead girls and now someone was spying on us. At this point, dad seemed less frightening.
After I toweled off, I slipped on a pair of shorts and a tank top, then piled my hair on top of my head. 
“Ready?” asked Nathan when I met him downstairs.
“Yeah, let me grab something to eat first”
When I entered the kitchen, mom was standing over the sink with the water running, her face pasty white.
“Are you okay?”
She nodded. “Yeah, I think I had a little too much wine last night. It’s finally catching up to me.”
“Really? A delayed hangover? That’s weird. Hey, what’s that on your neck?” I asked, staring at her skin. “Did you get bit by a couple of mosquitos?”
She touched her neck. “I must have.”
The skin on her neck was definitely swollen and there were two small red bumps just below her ear.
I squinted. “Does it itch? It looks pretty inflamed.”
My mom had always been very sensitive to bug bites, so it wasn’t a surprise that her skin was tender and sore-looking.
She shrugged. “No, not really. It’s a little tender, though.”
“You should put something on that,” I said, turning away from her. I reached into the cupboard and grabbed a box of chewy granola bars. “Some of that Neosporin stuff.”
“I will.” She touched her head and groaned. “God, remind me not to have more than one glass of wine the next time anyone offers.”
I snorted. “No doubt.”
She grabbed a paper towel, poured cool water over it, and then dabbed her forehead. “You know, I think I’m going to lie back down for a while.”
“Hey,” I said as she began walking away, “I have an interview this afternoon. That diner I was telling you about.”
“Good job, sweetheart. I’m sure you’ll get it.”
I’m sure, too. They’re really in need of help now that Amy’s gone, I thought bitterly. 
Thirty minutes later, Nathan and I were racing across the lake in the boat again. 
“Let’s head over to Sonny and Duncan’s marina!” he yelled over the engine.
I gave him the thumbs-up. I had to admit, the thought of seeing Duncan again was stirring up the butterflies in my stomach. 
The sun was already hot, and by the time we reached the marina, I could feel the back of my neck and shoulders begin to burn. I grabbed some sunscreen and started lathering it on.
“Hey!” called Duncan, who was putting gasoline into a fishing boat. 
“What’s up, Dunc?” asked Nathan.
He smiled. “Not much.”
Nathan docked the boat and tied it. “So, did your dad mention anything about the job yet?”
Duncan laughed. “Haven’t had time to talk about it. But I think you have the best shot so far. My dad seems to like you.”
“Cool. Nikki already has an interview later this afternoon for a waitressing job.”
Duncan looked at me. “Ruth’s?”
“Yeah. By the way, did you watch the news this morning?”
He shook his head. “No, been working.”
I told him about Amy and then mentioned the face in the window.
His eyebrow shot up. “Seriously? Wow, it’s weird that you mentioned that, because I’m pretty sure that someone was watching me last night, too.”

Chapter Nine



My stomach clenched up like a fist. “Really?”
He nodded. “It was just before midnight and I was in the kitchen, having a snack. I heard some weird scraping noises near one of the windows, and when I looked up, I could have sworn someone ducked away. I even went outside to check it out.”
I shivered. “Did you find anyone?”
“I didn’t. But I felt like someone was watching me when I was outside, too. I have to admit, it kind of scared the shit out of me.”
I turned to Nathan. “So, do you think I’m still seeing things?”
He looked at both of us and shook his head. “Fine, I believe you. Maybe it’s a Peeping Tom?”
Duncan shrugged. “Could be, or something worse. It also happened to me a few weeks ago, too, but I thought I was just imagining things. In fact, now that I think about it, I believe it happened around the night that girl went missing, Tina Johnson.” 
I looked at both of them. “And last night, Amy was murdered.”
Nathan groaned. “Nikki, quit it already. You watched the news! They have evidence that she committed suicide. They found drugs in her car and her wrists were slashed. She was messed up. Caleb’s daughter even told him she had issues.”
“Maybe, but I still have a hard time believing it. Someone could have killed her and covered it up. She was terrified of something. Why would she warn us if she wasn’t?”
Nathan walked over and shook me playfully. “You’re making something out of nothing. Okay, even if someone was watching both of you last night, it’s probably just some pervert.”
“And that’s supposed to make me feel better?” I asked incredulously.
With a determined look on his face, Duncan said, “You know what? I think we should try and catch whoever’s doing it.”
“How?” I asked, my heart beginning to race. It sounded frightening and exciting at the same time. 
“We could set up video cameras. I have some extra ones in storage that we keep for the marina. Hey, we could monitor both our cabins.”
I nodded, feeling the surge of adrenaline strike every part of my body. “I think we should! If we get it on camera, the sheriff will take us seriously!”
“Fine,” replied Nathan. “If it’s going to help you get over your paranoia, Nikki, I’ll help Duncan set it up.”
“Okay,” said Duncan. “I’m pretty busy this morning, but around lunchtime, I can get them out of storage and start setting things up.”
“I have to bring Nikki to her interview this afternoon. We’ll stop by your place after and you can follow us out to the cabin to set up something there.”
Duncan nodded. “Sounds good.”
“Thanks, Duncan,” I said softly. “I’ve been going nuts about this.”
Duncan’s eyes met mine. “You’re welcome.”
“We’d better get back,” said Nathan, looking at his watch. “I’m hungry and Nikki probably wants to prepare for her interview.”
His eyes lowered and he grinned. “If she keeps that outfit on, she’ll definitely get hired.”
My cheeks burned red. I didn’t know what to say, although I had to admit, I was beyond delighted.
Nathan snickered. “Wow, Duncan, I’ve never seen Nikki at a loss for words. Do you want to move in with us? Could sure use the peace.”
I flipped him the bird. “Very funny.”
Nathan untied the boat and pushed us away from the dock. “See you later, Dunc.”
“Yeah, see you,” I said.
“Goodbye and good luck with your interview,” he replied.
“Thanks.”
As we drifted away and Nathan started the engine, I put my sunglasses on and watched as Duncan began fueling another boat. Not only was he cute, but he believed me, without question. So far, he was the only real good thing I’d encountered in Shore Lake.
 

Chapter Ten

 
Three hours later, I sat across from Rosie, who’d inherited Ruth’s diner from her mother several years back. As she looked over my job application, I studied the rail-thin, bleach-blond woman and gathered she was somewhere in her sixties because of her weathered skin. She did have a cigarette resting behind her ear, so she could have actually been younger.
“You’re new in town?” she asked in a gravelly voice.
“Yes, we just moved here a couple of days ago.”
“Have you ever waitressed before?”
I sighed. “No. I worked at a boutique, though, so I’ve used a register before and have experience with customers.”
She nodded. “You’ll be on your feet a lot. Do you have any problems with that?”
I shook my head. 
“Are you available to work nights?”
I bit the side of my lip. “I’d prefer days, if that’s possible.”
She studied me. “To be honest, I really need the help at night. I don’t expect you to work past midnight, but my second shift is really hurting right now. I’m even willing to pay you an extra dollar an hour.”
I sighed. “That’s fine. Is there a chance that I can switch to days in the future? When school starts, my mom won’t want me working past ten.”
She nodded. “We won’t make you work past nine during the week, but we’d need you until midnight on Friday or Saturday. Would that be an issue for you?”
“No,” I answered.
She asked me a few more questions then hired me on the spot. 
“Wow, that was fast,” I blurted out.
She smiled. “We need the help, desperately. Can you start tomorrow?”
I nodded. “That shouldn’t be a problem.”
“You’ll be training with Susan. So, we’ll see you around four, tomorrow afternoon?”
I agreed and then she found me a uniform, which wasn’t easy with my short frame. When it was all said and done, I left the diner so giddy that I wanted to scream.
“Let me guess, they hated you,” smiled Nathan as I got into his Mustang. He’d been listening to the stereo and waiting for me in the parking lot.
I held up my hand. “I start tomorrow.”
He slapped it. “Good job. I also have awesome news; Sonny called my cell phone and I start next Monday. Pending a drug test. I’m sure Duncan had everything to do with it, but I’m not complaining.”
“That’s great!” I said and then swore. “So, how are we going to work this out? I need a ride to and from work until I’m able to get a car. They want me working second shift.”
“If I’m at the marina, I’ll try and work something out with Sonny. Maybe I can take my lunch break and pick you up at the cabin? I’m sure he’ll be cool with that. It’ll just be for a little while, anyway.”
I smiled. “Thanks. I know it isn’t easy driving me around everywhere.”
“Yeah, you’re kind of a pain in the ass,” he smirked.
I smacked him in the shoulder again. “You are an ass so I guess it kind of makes sense.”
He rubbed his arm. “I must have a permanent bruise there from you beating up on me all the time. Show your brother some love,” he pouted.
“Shut your yap and you won’t get hurt.”
“Ho, ho… big words from such a little twerp,” he said.
I raised my fist again. “You don’t listen very well, do you?”
He snorted and shook his head. “You’re so violent.”
I smiled. “Just remember that.”
“So, let’s head over to the marina and check out the surveillance equipment,” he said.
“Okay.”
Nathan gave me a sideways glance. “Although I’m sure Duncan will be monitoring someone else.”
“What?”
Nathan smiled. “Oh, come on. You know he has the hots for you.”
“Whatever,” I said, looking out the window.
“He does, but that’s okay because he seems like a decent guy. I think you should go for it.”
I snorted. “Go for it? Look, I’m not interested in going for anything right now.”
“Right. That’s why you blush every time he looks your way.”
“I do not!”
“You’re face turns as red as a tomato.”
I could feel it burning right now as he teased me.
“See!” he laughed.
“It’s just a sunburn!”
He shook his head and gave me a knowing look. 
I turned up the radio and tried avoiding his smartass grin.
When we arrived at the marina, we walked over to the cabin next door, where Duncan was adjusting his surveillance equipment.
“All set?” asked Nathan.
He nodded. “Yeah, I’ve got cameras set up all around the perimeter of this place. There’s no way I’ll miss this guy if he comes back.”
“You still want to do our cabin, too?”
He nodded. “Yeah, I’ll follow you in my truck. I’m ready whenever you are.”
“Shoot, I just remembered, I have to pick up mom’s dry cleaning. Is it okay if Nikki rides with you and shows you where we live? I’ll meet you both at the cabin as soon as I’m done.”
My eyes narrowed, I didn’t remember her requesting anything like that. In fact, she was supposed to drive into town herself sometime today. I didn’t mention any of this, however. I didn’t want Duncan to think Nathan was trying to play matchmaker.
“Sure,” replied Duncan. He looked at me. “Should we get going?”
I nodded and then followed him to a white pickup truck with “Sonny’s Boat Repairs” on it.
Duncan apologized. “Sorry, it’s nothing fancy but it gets me places.”
I smiled. “It’s better than what I have, which is nothing.”
He turned the radio on and glanced at me. “You look nice. How did your interview go?”
I smiled. “I got the job. In fact, I start tomorrow evening.” 
“See, I told you, you’d get it.”
I looked down at my clothes. For the interview, I had worn a peach silk blouse and mid-length black skirt with heels. My feet were already killing me.
“I guess I know where I’ll be eating dinner from now on.”
I laughed. “It’s your stomach. I’m not cooking, you know, I’m only serving.”
He shrugged. “That’s okay. I’ll come in and be one of those annoying customers who sits and drinks coffee all day long, but I’ll leave a much better tip.”
“As long as you tip, I’ll save you a booth.”
“So,” he said, changing the subject. “Do you remember anything about the face you saw in the window?”
I shook my head. “No, it left so quickly. I know it wasn’t an animal like the sheriff suggested.”
“You called the sheriff?”
“He came over for dinner. He has the hots for my mom.”
He laughed. “Boy, he works fast.”
“My mom is already looking at engagement rings.”
He raised his eyebrows.
I laughed. “I’m just kidding.”
“I was going to say...”
“No, but she certainly likes him. Anyway, he went out and looked around for a while, but figured it was just a raccoon.”
“But you don’t believe it?”
“No,” I said. “There wasn’t any fur on the face that I saw.”
I then explained about the feeling of being watched when we were on the deck and the shadow that flew into the trees. As I went on, his face darkened. 
“What?” I asked.
“That’s happened to me before, too. I thought I was imagining it and made excuses, thinking it was a large barn owl or something.”
I could feel the goose bumps traveling up my arms again. “This thing that I saw stood as tall as you. I couldn’t make out what it looked like, but it was something much larger than a bird.”
“Hopefully, these cameras will pick something up. They have a range of one hundred feet. I’ll make sure some of them are pointing towards the woods, too.”
When we made it back to the cabin, it was almost five o’clock and my mother was gone.
“Wow, nice place,” said Duncan. 
“It is. Too bad I’m not enjoying it because I’m so freaked out at night.”
“I don’t blame you.”
I showed him around the cabin and then he started unloading the truck.
“Um, is there a way that you can put a camera near my bedroom balcony?” I asked.
“Have you seen someone looking through it?” he asked, incredulously.
“Actually, I thought I saw someone staring at me through the window in my bathroom when I was getting out of the tub.”
He raised his eyebrows. “He actually saw you naked?”
My face turned pink. “I think so.”
Duncan smiled wickedly. “I guess it would be inappropriate for me to say, ‘Lucky man’?”
My jaw dropped and I smiled. “Uh, yeah!”
“I’m sorry, I just couldn’t resist.”
“Right.”
“I’m sorry, that was uncalled for; a feeble attempt to flirt.”
“You were trying to flirt with me?”
His gray eyes burned into mine. “I was. Did it work?”
I shivered in pleasure.  “Well, I…”
Thankfully, Nathan pulled up in his car at that moment and I was saved from having to answer anything. 
“Hey, guys,” he said, slamming the door. 
“Hi,” said Duncan, walking past him. “Nikki just gave me a tour of the place, so let’s start getting these things set up before it gets dark.”
“Sounds good,” replied Nathan.
“Where’s the dry cleaning?” I whispered.
He smiled sheepishly. “Oh, I must have forgotten it.”
“You did that on purpose. Thanks,” I said, sarcastically.
“You’re welcome. Did you guys make out, yet?”
I punched him in the shoulder.

Chapter Eleven

It took a couple of hours to set up all of the cameras. Mom showed up just as we were finishing up.
“What’s all this?” she asked.
Nathan explained that we were setting up surveillance to catch a Peeping Tom.
“I thought we were through with that?” she said. She was wearing dark sunglasses and looked like she was still suffering from her hangover.
I cleared my throat. “Duncan had someone looking in his windows last night, too, mom. It’s not just us.”
She raised her eyebrows. “Really?” 
Duncan nodded. “Yeah and it was definitely not an animal.”
Mom yawned. “Then I hope you catch whoever is doing it. It’s probably some pervert or something.”
“Or a killer,” I said.
“What?” she asked, incredulously. She’d obviously heard me but didn’t believe what I was suggesting.
“Nothing.”
She yawned again. “Listen, I’m going to lie down for a while. I’m so wiped out.”
“Do you want me to make dinner?” I asked.
She grimaced. “Actually, I’ve been nauseated all day. I’m going to eat a couple more crackers and then go right to bed.”
“Duncan, would you like to dine with us?” asked Nathan as mom trudged up the stairs and into the cabin. “I make a mean frozen pizza.”
Duncan laughed. “No, I have to head back before my old man starts hounding me again,” he said, raising his cell phone. “He’s already sent me a message, wondering where I am.”
“Okay, thanks for setting all of this up. I kind of hope we see some action tonight,” said Nathan.
“Here’s my number,” he said, holding out a business card. “My dad made these for me to give to customers. Call me if something happens.”
“Will do. Your dad has my number, call me if you catch a prowler.”
“Okay. Good luck with your new job, Nikki,” said Duncan. “I’ll give you a couple of days before I stop in and harass you.”
“Thanks.” 
After Duncan left, we walked around the perimeter of the house again to make sure all of the cameras were facing the right way.
“There’s even one by your balcony to make sure some Romeo doesn’t try and steal you away at night.”
I snorted. “If someone shows up on my balcony, I’m going to beat them with my bat while I scream bloody murder.”
He laughed. “That guy has no chance.”
We went into the kitchen where Nathan made a pizza and then joined me on the couch to watch movies.
“So what do you think of mom dating Caleb?” I asked. 
“He seems like a good guy.”
“You don’t think it’s too soon for her?”
“I think mom is lonely and wants to feel protected. The town’s sheriff sure fits that bill.”
I shrugged. “I suppose. I’m just worried about her getting hurt.”
“Nobody can hurt her as much as dad did,” said Nathan. “Sad but true.”
That was for certain.
I fell asleep halfway through some horror flick about zombies when several loud thuds from outside woke me up.
“What was that?” I gasped.
Nathan stood up and I could tell he was as freaked out as I was. “I don’t know.”
Something heavy banged against the door, and we both jumped.
“Oh, my God, Nathan, what’s happening?” 
He ran into the kitchen and came back out carrying the butcher knife. 
“You’re not going out there, are you?” I whispered in horror.
He swallowed. “I was considering it.”
More loud bangs and I grabbed the phone. “I’m calling nine-one-one.”
“Wait, it could be a raccoon or a bear.”
“A bear; like you’d want to tackle that by yourself, anyway.”
He nodded. “True. I’m going to open up the blinds and look outside.”
I followed him over to the window. “Can you see anything?” I asked as he peeked through the gap in the blinds.
“Shit,” he whispered.
“What?”
He turned towards me, his face as white as a ghost. “It’s the cameras. Un… fucking… believable!”
I looked outside and gasped. Even in the dark I could tell that someone had destroyed all of the surveillance equipment we’d set up.
We raced upstairs and woke up mom. She called the police, and a half hour later, one of the deputy sheriffs arrived at the house. 
“I don’t know who did this, but they’re gone now,” he said. He was a middle-aged man with a curly black moustache that he kept touching, which creeped me out. 
Mom let out a long, ragged sigh. “Why would somebody do this?”  
“Oh, I don’t know… so they wouldn’t get caught spying on us?” I muttered sarcastically.
“Can you check for fingerprints or anything?” asked Nathan.
He nodded. “Yeah, I put a call in for a couple of our guys to get out here and do that, so try not to touch anything. They should be arriving any minute.”
“So, where is the sheriff?” I asked.
“Caleb? Oh, it’s his night off,” replied the deputy. “He won’t be back in until late tomorrow night.”
Mom nodded. “He mentioned that he was going out of town today with his daughter.”
“Let me get a statement from you and then I’ll be on my way. There isn’t much we can do without any evidence right now. If we pick up something from the fingerprints, we’ll proceed from there.”
After everyone was gone, mom dragged herself back to bed but Nathan and I were still spooked and unable to sleep. 
Nathan shook his head. “Duncan is going to be pissed when he finds out what happened. That was thousands of dollars in video equipment this person destroyed.”
“Let’s call him, it’s only eleven. I’m sure he’s awake.”
A half hour later Duncan pulled up in his white truck. Our eyes met immediately and I had to admit, I was really glad to see him.
“Wow,” he said, “This is amazing. I can’t believe someone trashed all of these cameras. Did you see anything?’
“We heard the crashes but were too freaked out to investigate when it was happening,” I said. “It actually happened pretty quickly.”
“They must have brought their own ladder,” said Nathan. “I locked up the other one we’d used, earlier.”
Duncan walked over to one of the trees and smiled proudly. “They missed one. I hid it pretty good. Let’s go see if it recorded anything interesting.”
Nathan slapped him on the back. “You are the man!” 
Fifteen minutes later, we stared in awe at the video screen. 
“What in the hell?” asked Nathan.
We watched in disbelief, as two of the other cameras were violently ripped from the house, but there was no sign of whoever was doing it.
“Ghosts?” I gasped incredulously. “I mean, there’s nobody there!”
Duncan and Nathan looked at each other, both obviously stunned as well.
“This is freaking crazy. It doesn’t make sense,” said Nathan.
We rewound the video and watched it again with the same results. It seemed as if an invisible force had destroyed each of the cameras.
“Okay, common sense doesn’t explain this at all,” said Duncan. “Maybe it is some kind of poltergeist?”
“If it is, I’m definitely not staying here any longer,” I said. The thought of the cabin being inhabited by ghosts freaked the crap out of me. I saw the movies Poltergeist and Amityville Horror. I knew when it was time to leave. Not after the ghosts tried killing you, but before.
“We have to show the sheriff,” said Nathan. “Maybe he can make sense of it.”
“Sense? A fucking ghost is messing with our minds, Nathan,” I snapped. “You keep trying to make scientific excuses because you don’t want to believe it. Look at the film! You heard the loud bangs! The cameras didn’t just fall from the house by themselves! We’ve got to get the hell out of this town!”
He raised his hands. “Okay, calm down. You’re right. Something is happening that is beyond any explanation that I can come up with. We’ll show mom tomorrow and still talk to the sheriff. If it is some kind of ghost, we’ll get the cabin… exorcised or something.”
“Maybe you should talk to the owners of the cabin?” interrupted Duncan. “They might already be aware of these ghosts.”
“What about your house, Duncan?” I asked. “How do you explain the face in the window or shadows flying into the trees?”
He smiled wryly. “Maybe the ghost is roaming the town? I don’t know. None of this shit makes sense to me, either.”
We watched the video one last time and then Duncan turned it off. “I’m going home to check on the cameras I’ve installed there, to see if they’re still in place. I’ll call you if I find anything else odd.”
“Duncan,” I said. “I’m sorry about the damaged equipment. I wish we could somehow replace it for you.”
He waved his hand. “Hell, it’s not your fault. If anything, we may have actual proof that ghosts inhabit Shore Lake,” he said with a sinister smile. “We could all become rich and famous.”

Chapter Twelve


 
I woke up around nine-thirty the next morning and noticed that mom was still sleeping.
“She must be coming down with something,” I said to Nathan, who was outside sweeping up pieces of the broken video equipment. 
He shrugged. “Could be the fresh air.”
“Maybe. So, did you hear anything from Duncan yet?”
“Yeah, he said his cameras were fine and there didn’t appear to be anything unusual going on in the videos.”
“That’s good, I guess. I had a hard time sleeping last night. I felt like something was watching me again.”
He laughed. “Probably me. I checked up on you a couple of times and you were snoring away.”
“I do not snore.”
“How in the hell do you know?”
I raised my chin. “I just do.”
He snorted. “Whatever. Anyway, as soon as mom gets up, we’ll show her the video and see what she thinks.”
Just then, an old red pickup drove up the path and parked next to Nathan’s Mustang.
“It’s our neighbor. I think mom said her name’s Abigail,” said Nathan.
“Hello!” said the older woman, getting out of the truck. “I just wanted to stop by and welcome you. Sorry it took me so long.”
“No problem,” said Nathan. “We should have come over and introduced ourselves.”
“No worries,” she replied, carrying a large pie pan. “I hope you like strawberry rhubarb pie; I made it fresh, early this morning!”
“We love it, thank you,” said Nathan as she handed it to him. “Wow, it looks awesome.”
“My name is Abigail, by the way. I live at the next cabin over.” 
“I’m Nathan and that’s Nikki,” said Nathan.
“Hi,” I said.
“Wonderful to meet you both.”
Abigail looked like she was in her seventies or eighties, had reddish-brown hair and watery green eyes.
“I’ll be right back,” said Nathan. “I’ll put the pie in the kitchen. Did you want a piece, Abigail?”
She shook her head and smiled. “No, but thank you. I made it for you folks.”
“Okay, if you change your mind, let me know,” he called, going into the house.
“Um, our mother’s not feeling well,” I explained. “Otherwise she’d be out here greeting you, too. I’m sure she’ll be sad that she missed you.”
She smiled. “That’s all right.”
“I suppose you saw the police here a couple of times,” I said. 
Her smile fell. “Yes I did notice that.”
“We found a body the first night we arrived, and last night, someone smashed our video equipment. We’ve been trying to catch the culprit. It’s been pretty crazy.”
“A body?” she said, her eyes widening. “Was it that young girl they mentioned on the news? Tina Johnson?”
I nodded. “Yes. They think she drowned and washed up here.”
“They don’t think it’s… foul play?”
“Well,” I said. “Personally, I think it is, but nobody else seems to believe it.”
She leaned forward. “And why do you think it’s foul play?”
I sighed. “Because we’ve had someone trying to scare us every night since we arrived. Then, the waitress who supposedly killed herself in the woods the other night, Amy? She gave me a warning the same day she died.”
“What do you mean?”
“She slipped me a note at Ruth’s, warning me not to go out at night and not to let any strangers into our home.”
Abigail stared at me for a few seconds and then let out a long sigh. “Nikki, she gave you some good advice. If I were you, I’d stay in and not invite anyone into your cabin. Especially, those you don’t know.”
My heart began to pound. “So, you think it’s dangerous out here at night?”
Her eyes grew misty. “I know it is. My husband was killed by something evil,” she said, looking up at towards trees. “There are things in Shore Lake that you don’t know about; things you couldn’t even imagine. In fact, I wanted to come over and warn you myself, before I left town.”
“What do you mean?” I asked, the hair standing up on the back of my neck.
Just then, Nathan walked out. “Okay, I couldn’t resist, Abigail; I had a little piece. And let me tell you, it was the best strawberry rhubarb pie I’d ever tasted.” 
She nodded. “Good.”
Noticing her sudden melancholy, he asked, “Are you okay?”  
“Um, Nathan, Abigail was just telling me it’s dangerous here at night and that her husband was murdered.”
Nathan’s stared at her in horror. “Your husband was murdered? Do you know who did it?”
“Vampires,” she stated without hesitation.
“Excuse me?” choked Nathan.
Her face darkened. “Shore Lake is infested with vampires.” 
He burst out laughing and clapped his hands. “Okay, very funny, Abigail. Vampires, that’s a good one!”
The look in her eyes was so serious, it made me start to doubt what was real and what wasn’t. 
“Don’t mock me,” she said. “I’m not joking, young man.”
The porch door opened up and mom stepped out. She was wearing dark sunglasses and still looked unusually pale. 
“Hey, mom,” said Nathan. “This is Abigail.”
Mom nodded. “Yes, I remember seeing you fishing the other day. Nice to meet you, Abigail. I’m Anne.”
“Nice to meet you, too. Say, if you don’t mind my asking, what’s wrong with your neck?”
The swelling on mom’s neck appeared to be getting worse. She touched it and winced. “I don’t know. I think I was bitten by a couple of mosquitos, or maybe even a spider.”
Abigail cleared her throat. “I used to be a nurse, can I take a look?” 
“Sure,” replied mom. 
Abigail walked up onto the porch and examined the bites. After a few seconds she stepped back. “When did you get those?” 
Mom shrugged. “I don’t know, the other night when the sheriff was over for dinner. I didn’t notice it until the next morning.”
“Sheriff Caleb?” asked Abigail.
“Yes, the sheriff,” I said. “I guess you could say they’re dating.”
Abigail backed away from mom and then hurried down the porch. “I have to go. It was nice meeting you folks.”
“What’s wrong?” I asked. First her talk about vampires, and now she appeared to be spooked by the bites on mom’s neck. Then it hit me. “You’re not thinking that the bites on mom’s neck are… vampire bites, are you?” I asked with a wry smile. Even I had a hard time believing her ridiculous talk. Believing in ghosts was bad enough.  
She opened her truck door and turned back to look at us. “Damn right I do.”
 
 
Chapter Thirteen


“What?” chuckled mom, staring at her in disbelief.
She pointed towards her neck. “You’ve got the mark and if you don’t get out of town while you still can, you’ll be a threat to your children and everyone else in town.”
All of us watched her in stunned silence as she slammed the door and drove away, kicking up dust in her wake.
“Now that was really weird,” I said.
“What a fruitcake,” said mom as she turned around and headed back into the house. “Certifiable nutcase.”
I followed her in and we went into the kitchen.
“So, um… are you feeling, okay?” I asked.
She removed her sunglasses and smiled. “I feel like turning into a vampire and sucking your blood!” she joked.
I snorted. “Yeah, that was one weird old lady. Maybe she’s the one trying to scare us.”
She sighed. “You know, I never thought of that. I should mention it to Caleb when he comes over tonight.”
“Are you guys going on a real date this time, or are you cooking, again?” 
“Actually, he’s planning on bringing me to his place. His daughter is making dinner for both of us, I guess.” 
“Mom,” said Nathan, coming into the kitchen. “Did Nikki tell you yet?”
“Tell me what?”
Nathan told her about the video and she followed us into the den to watch it.
“Something must be wrong with the camera,” said mom. “There’s no way that video equipment fell to the ground on its own.”
“Or… we have a poltergeist,” I said.
She looked at me and groaned. “You’ve got to be kidding! First all this talk about vampires, and now, you, with the ghosts?”
“Then how do you explain what happened on the film?” said Nathan. “Even I’m having a little trouble with it.”
She closed her eyes and rubbed the bridge of her nose. “Seriously, I don’t know. Maybe Duncan didn’t fasten them down tight enough and they fell. Or maybe an animal pulled them down.”
“I think we should show them to the sheriff and see what he thinks,” said Nathan.
“Okay, he’ll be here after nine o’clock to pick me up. I’ll show him.”
“You hungry, mom?” asked Nathan. “I can make you something.”
“Could you? I’m starving,” she said. “I’ll go take a shower and you can make me whatever you want.”
“Okay, how about a hamburger?” he asked. 
She yawned. “Oh, now that sounds good.”
“How do you want it prepared?”
Mom turned to him and smiled wickedly. “Bloody rare. I’m turning into a vampire, you know.”

~~~

I spent most of the day watching television and thinking about Duncan. He was coming over tonight when I was finished at the diner, and all three of us were going to try and videotape some more ghost activity. Nathan now believed it was really a poltergeist and was even talking about hiring an expert to help us.
Nathan dropped me off at the diner just before four o’clock. It was busy and the waitress who was supposed to train me, Susan, appeared stressed out. 
“Just follow me around for now and when it slows up, I’ll go over the menus and tickets,” she said, stepping around me with a tray full of food.
“Okay.”
I followed her to a busy table while other customers tried getting her attention. She handed out the food and then I followed her back to the counter, where she handed me a coffeepot.
“Better idea, why don’t you just go around and see if any of my tables need coffee or soda refills?” she said, pointing to her section. 
Unfortunately, it never did slow down and I spent most of my time following her around or refilling beverages. At the end of the night, my feet were sore, but Susan had shared some of her tips, so I was happy.
“Sorry the training sucked today,” she said, removing her apron. “We’ve been so busy ever since Amy…” she looked away.
I nodded. “I understand.”
She turned back to me and her eyes were moist. “She was a good friend. It’s going to be hard to replace her.”
“I doubt I could ever replace her,” I said. “In fact, she was the one who gave me the application in the first place.”
“Listen, if you can stay a little later tomorrow night, I’ll go over everything else with you that we missed during our shift. Friday evenings are always busy, so plan on being here, late.”
“Okay, thanks.”
“Just remember two of the most important rules: the customer is always right, even when they’re wrong, and to always smile, even when you want to slit their throats. Especially the super picky customers.”
I smiled. “Okay.”
She stared at me for a minute.
“What?” I asked.
“You know, you look very similar to Amy. Different color hair, but your features are similar.”
My cell phone began to vibrate.
“It’s my ride,” I told her and answered the phone.
“Hi,” said Nathan. “My car won’t start.”
“What do you mean?” 
He sighed. “The battery must be dead or something. I’m trying to get ahold of Duncan, to see if he can give you a ride home.”
“What about mom?”  
“I can’t find her keys anywhere. Caleb’s already picked her up, and she forgot her cell phone here on the counter.”
“Great. Okay, let me know if you talk to Duncan. I’ll just hang out here for a while.”
I hung up the phone and Susan tapped me on the shoulder. “Sorry, I wasn’t trying to listen in but… do you need a ride?”
“I might.”
“My brother should be here in a half hour. I’m sure he’ll give you one.”
I smiled. “Thanks. I can’t wait until I get my own car. Relying on someone else for a ride all the time is so frustrating.”
“I know. I’m going outside to have a smoke, you want to join me?”
“I don’t smoke but I’ll come out with you”
We both grabbed a couple of sodas and I followed her out the back door of the diner where there was a picnic table. We sat down in the darkness and she cleared her throat. “At least it’s a nice night. The moon is full and there aren’t any clouds.”
It was true; the stars were bright and it was a little cool outside, so we weren’t getting bitten up by mosquitos. It seemed really peaceful, although I kept thinking about Amy and her warnings about how dangerous it was at night in Shore Lake.
Susan lit up a cigarette and took a long drag. “Oh, man, I needed that.”
“So… you were friends with Amy?” I asked.
“Yeah,” she said, looking away. “I still can’t believe she’s gone.”
“She seemed really nice when I met her.”
Susan looked at me and nodded. “She was a sweetheart. Her boyfriend, though, he was scary. I’m glad she dumped him.”
“She had a boyfriend?”
She blew out another stream of smoke. “Yeah, Ethan. He hangs out here sometimes at night with his crew. They’re all kind of freaky if you ask me.”
“Why, what do you mean?”
Susan shrugged. “I don’t know; there’s just something strange about them. They come in here, hardly saying a word to each other. They just sit and stare at us, sipping their coffee. Ethan is the scariest. He’s cute, but there’s something about him that makes me nervous. He has these penetrating blue eyes that give me the creeps. Anyway, I really hate serving them, but they’re paying customers, so we can’t exactly kick them out.”
I cleared my throat. “Weird. So, why did she break up with this Ethan guy?”
She laughed. “Amy always had quite the imagination. Everyone thought she was a little… nuts, and maybe, she really was. I mean, she did kill herself. Anyway, she once told me she thought he was a vampire.”
“What?” I choked on my diet soda.
“I know, right?” she smirked. “A freakin’ vampire! Although, if I did believe in vampires, he’d be the first on my list of suspects.”
My throat was really dry as I took another sip of soda. First Abigail, and now Amy; both believed there were vampires roaming the town.
“We’d better go back into the diner,” she said, putting out her cigarette. “My brother will be here soon. I’ll see if he can give you a ride.”
My cell phone went off again as we entered the diner. 
“It’s Nathan,” said my brother. “Duncan’s coming to pick you up.”
“Great, thanks,” I said.
“Make sure he brings you straight home. Don’t go jumping his bones or anything.”
“Ha-ha. You are such a comedian.”
He laughed and hung up.
“I’m getting a ride from a friend,” I told Susan. “Thanks for the offer, though.”
“No problem. Oh, my brother’s here,” she said, looking at her phone. “He just texted me. I’ll see you tomorrow, at four o’clock again?”
“Yeah, see you tomorrow.” 
After she left, I sat down at one of the booths, to finish my soda and wait for Duncan. As I watched the front door, a group of kids around my age walked through. One of the other waitresses seated them.
“Same as usual?” asked the older waitress, who I’d met earlier. Her name was Darlene and she was close to retiring.
“Just coffee,” said a broad-shouldered, dark-haired guy, ordering for everyone. He handed her back the menu and our eyes met.
Embarrassed, I looked away quickly and stared outside at the parking lot, watching for Duncan. 
Before I could blink, someone slid into my booth and I was suddenly facing the stranger whose eyes I’d just met.
“Um, hi,” I said, sitting up straighter.
“Um, hi, yourself,” he said with a slow, lazy grin. 
Oh wow…
“I’m Nikki,” I replied, feeling myself blush at the intense way he was staring at me. I knew it had to be Amy’s ex-boyfriend, and he was undoubtedly gorgeous. He had thick, dark eyebrows with icy blue eyes; his face was perfectly sculpted with high cheekbones and a strong chin. His lips… they were sensual and even fuller than mine.
“You’re new in town?”
“Yes,” I replied, now studying his face more closely. He was definitely a little pale, which reminded me of the fact that Amy had accused him of being vampire. As I stared at him, I reasoned that most girls my age would have swooned at such a good-looking guy, but after everything that had happened the last few nights, I felt a cold shiver run down my spine. 
“Welcome to Shore Lake,” he replied, looking into my eyes again.
“Thanks.”
It was weird, but we sat there and stared at each other for a while without talking. Soon, I started feeling a heat somewhere inside of my belly that turned into an overwhelming ache of desire, further south.  
“I, ah…” My heart was pounding in my chest and I felt a strong urge to touch him. It was almost overwhelming.
“Nikki,” interrupted Duncan, standing next to our table. “Are you ready to go?”
I looked at Duncan and the spell, or whatever it was, was broken. “Yeah,” I said. “I’m ready.”
“Goodbye, Nikki,” said Ethan, with a small grin. “I’m sure we’ll meet again.”
“Goodbye,” I murmured, looking away. I was confused at the intense rush of desire I’d had for Ethan. He was a total stranger. How did that even happen?
“Who was that?” asked Duncan as he followed me out to his truck.
I don’t know how I knew, but there was no doubt in my mind that Ethan was still staring at me through the window. I shivered and wrapped my arms around myself. “You might think I’m crazy, but I’m pretty sure he was a vampire.”

Chapter Fourteen


“Excuse me?” he asked, unlocking the truck.
We both slid inside and I looked at him. “Amy was convinced he was a vampire, and there’s something about him that’s totally… unnerving.”
He shook his head and smiled as he started up the truck. “Okay, your imagination is really getting the best of you. It’s bad enough that there might be a ghost haunting your cabin, but a vampire in the local diner?”
I nodded. “I feel the same way, but there was something so strange about him. He made me feel…”
He raised his eyebrows. “He made you feel what?”
I swallowed hard. “Um, weird.”
I wasn’t about to tell Duncan that at one moment, I wanted to jump Ethan’s bones and probably would have, if we’d been alone. It didn’t even make sense to me.
Duncan looked back towards the diner. “If he gives you any problems, let me know.”
I smiled. “Sure.”
We pulled out of the parking lot in silence as I thought about the strange encounter. Duncan glanced at me a couple of times, and I could tell there was something on his mind, as well.
“What’s wrong?” I asked him.
He pulled over to the side of the road.
“What is it, Duncan?”
He tapped the steering wheel a couple of times and then looked at me. There was a funny smile on his face. “When I approached you with Ethan, you almost looked like you were ready to tear his clothes off or something. I don’t know; it just made me feel a little… jealous.”
I’m not even sure how it happened, but the next thing I knew, I was straddling him in the front seat and our mouths were crushed against each other. 
“Nikki,” he groaned against my lips.
My heart was pounding madly in my chest and I rocked against him, causing him to suck in his breath. He pulled away and looked into my eyes.
“I don’t think…” he whispered.
“Don’t think,” I said breathlessly, pulling him back towards my lips. There was an intense hunger inside of me, one that I’d never felt before. I wanted to tear off both of our clothing, just so I could feel our skin moving against each other.
His mouth was hot, and soon he was kissing my neck while his hands moved under my shirt. As he was about to slide his fingers under my bra, my cell phone rang, startling us both. He quickly removed his hands and I got off of his lap. 
My face was burning with embarrassment as I fumbled for my phone. “Yeah?”  I said into it, unable to look at Duncan.
“Hello to you, too,” mumbled Nathan.
I cleared my throat. “Sorry.”
“You guys almost home, yet?”
I nervously bit off a hangnail. “Almost.”
“Okay, I ordered a pizza and it’s already here, so hurry the hell up.”
I hung up and stole a glance at Duncan. 
“I’m sorry,” he said, although his eyes were still smoldering. “I don’t know what came over me.”
I smiled sheepishly. “I, um… it was me.  I practically raped you. I’ve never done that before, to anyone. I’m sorry.”
“At least I know you like me.”
I burst out laughing. “Do you think?”
“I’m sure you could probably tell that I liked you, too,” he said, grinning.
My cheeks grew hot and I changed the subject. “So, I hope you’re hungry. Nathan has a pizza waiting for us.”
“Oh, I’m starving, alright,” he said under his breath.
I looked at him and sighed. “Duncan, I…”
He stared at me for a minute. “It’s okay,” he said. “I’m not in a rush for anything.”
I smiled. “Thank you. I really do like you, you know. I’m just…”
He held up his hand. “Hey, it’s okay.”
It wasn’t okay. I really liked Duncan but I’d never attacked anyone before in my life like that. It was almost like the burning desire I’d felt towards Ethan had carried over towards Duncan. I was beginning to wonder if Ethan really was a vampire and had given off some kind of weird pheromone. 
We rode in silence the rest of the way to the cabin. Nathan was sitting on the porch, holding a BB gun, when we arrived.
“We come in peace,” teased Duncan, raising his hands in the air.
Nathan grinned. “Sorry. I was beginning to freak myself out, so I grabbed my old BB gun. I thought I heard some noises in the woods. But then, I actually found a couple of raccoons prowling around.”
 “Is the video camera still set up?” asked Duncan.
“Yeah. I think we should hang out on Nikki’s balcony and watch from above. See if we can see anyone sneaking around,” said Nathan. “Just in case it isn’t a ghost, but some degenerate trying to mess with us.”
“Good idea,” replied Duncan. 
We went inside, grabbed the box of pizza and some plates, and then headed up to my bedroom. On the balcony, Nathan had set up three chairs and a bistro table. We sat down and started eating.
“How was work?” asked Nathan.
“Busy. I met this girl named Susan who was friends with Amy.”
“Is she cute?” asked Nathan.
I snorted. “God, is that all you think about?”
“Is there anything else, Dunc?”
Duncan smiled but didn’t say anything.
“Anyway, Susan was telling me that Amy believed her ex-boyfriend, Ethan, was a vampire.”
Nathan grunted. “Yeah, I’d say Amy was a little messed up.”
“I don’t know,” I said, staring at my pizza.
His eyes narrowed. “What do you mean, you don’t know?”
I swallowed. “I met Ethan tonight and there was something really strange about him.”
“He was dating Amy at one point, that tells you enough right there,” said Nathan, grabbing another piece of pizza.
“Right. Anyway, he came over and sat by me at the restaurant. Um, when he looked into my eyes, I almost felt like… I was under some kind of spell.”
“Spell? What do you mean by that?” asked Nathan, chuckling. “Like he was hypnotizing you?”
“I can’t explain it,” I said, looking sideways at Duncan. There was no way that I was going to admit feeling attracted to Ethan, when Duncan was sitting right next to me. But, I did want Nathan to know that I felt easily manipulated.  “It was weird. I almost felt like if he asked me to do something, I’d have a hard time fighting it off.”
Nathan sat back and groaned. “There is no such thing as vampires, period. Quit letting Abigail’s and Amy’s crazy notions play with your mind. I mean, come on, Nikki, you know better than that!”
I shrank down in my seat. “I know. It’s just…I can’t explain it.”
Nathan looked at Duncan. “What do you think about all of this?”
Duncan shrugged. “I don’t know. I think something strange is going on and I’m not ruling anything out.”
Nathan snorted. “Even vampires?”
“Maybe this Ethan guy believes he’s a vampire and knows how to manipulate other people into believing it, too.”
Nathan took a drink of his soda and then nodded. “Okay, I guess that sounds more reasonable to me. Maybe he knows how to actually hypnotize people. That would explain how Nikki felt when he stared into her eyes.”
“Maybe,” I answered.
We sat in silence, as we finished the pizza and stared towards the woods. It was pretty silent except for the leaves rustling in the wind.
“Anyone want something to drink?” asked Nathan, standing up.
“I’ll take some water,” I replied.
“Me, too,” answered Duncan.
When Nathan left us alone, I stole a glance towards Duncan, who I found was staring at me.
“What?” I asked, feeling shy.
He smiled. “I was just thinking how beautiful you looked in the moonlight. I know that sounds like a line, but it’s true.”
I returned his smile. “Thanks, Duncan.”
He clasped his fingers and rested his chin on them. “So, did you leave a broken heart back in California?”
I snorted. “No. In fact, I guess you could say I haven’t had many boyfriends.”
“I find that hard to believe. The guys there must be blind and stupid.”
I blushed. “It’s not like I didn’t get asked out. I just wasn’t interested, I guess.”
“So, would you be interested now?”
“Maybe. Depends on the guy,” I answered, and then realized in shock that I was flirting back. 
He smiled..
“Duncan,” said Nathan, as he stepped onto the balcony. “I almost forgot, could you take a look at my Mustang? I think it’s the battery I’m having problems with, but I want to make sure.”
“Do you have a battery tester?” he asked.
“Actually, there might be one in the garage, I never even looked.”
Duncan got up. “Let’s go and check it out.”
Nathan nodded. “Thanks. Nikki, you can keep watch from up here and let us know if you see anything. I brought you the BB gun,” he said, handing it to me. “You still know how to use it?”
“Yeah.”
“Okay. Holler if you see anything,” he said.
They left me and I gripped the gun firmly in my hands, feeling uneasy because I was now alone and they were going to be in the garage.
Nathan’s laughter echoed through the darkness. I watched as the guys stepped away from the cabin and headed over to the garage.
“Nothing to be afraid of,” I murmured to myself, staring towards the dark woods. 
An owl hooted and I was reminded of some of the scary movies I’d watched with Nathan. An owl hoots and then something sinister usually happens in the next scene. I knew it was just cinema, but I felt a chill in my veins just the same.
My eyes darted quickly from one side of the yard to the other, and my breath caught in my throat as I saw a shadow move across the grass. I looked up into the sky, but saw nothing out of the ordinary.
“Nikki,” whispered a deep masculine voice behind me.
I whipped my head around, but found myself alone. I stood up and backed away from the table, frightened beyond belief. Hot breath brushed against the back of my neck and I whirled around again, this time seeing a blurry haze of movement.
“Oh, my God… Nathan!” I screamed, running into my bedroom. I ran downstairs and threw the front door open. “Nathan!” I yelled, again.
Nathan and Duncan rushed out of the garage towards me.
“What’s wrong?” called Nathan.
“Someone… was… on the balcony,” I gasped, out of breath. 
He looked behind me. “Who?”   
I shook my head. “I don’t know. I heard my name and then I felt someone breathing against the back of my neck.”
“Someone’s in the cabin?” Nathan swore, and then rushed past me and towards the house.
Duncan could tell I was pretty shook up and put his arms around me. He stared down into my eyes. “Are you okay?”
I nodded and leaned into him, closing my eyes. “I am now.”
Suddenly, he was ripped from my arms and thrown backwards.
“Duncan!” I screamed as he landed on the ground. 
“I’m fine,” he answered with an incredulous look on his face. He got up and began walking back towards me.
There was a flash of movement and he went flying through the air again, much farther this time. As I rushed towards him, I felt something pick me up, and then we were moving like the wind.
“Help!” I screamed in terror. We were going so fast that my head was spinning. The next thing I knew I was lying on the ground and a pair of steely blue eyes held mine. 
“We meet again,” whispered Ethan, trailing a cool finger down my cheek. 
I was paralyzed as his eyes burned into mine. A familiar yearning spread through my veins and suddenly I wanted him fiercely.
“Sweet Nikki,” he whispered with a small smile. He then licked his lips and lowered them to mine. Suddenly, we were kissing and I felt an urgent need to wrap my legs around him; to surrender myself to whatever he demanded. What was even stranger was that our lips melded perfectly together and that they weren’t quite strangers.
“Oh,” I breathed when he removed his mouth and began a hot trail down my neck with his tongue. My entire body was trembling with desire. “Oh, God.”
He chuckled softly against my skin. “Not quite.”  
Someone shouted my name, startling me back to my senses and I tensed up underneath him. 
Duncan!
Ethan raised his head and I could see the rage burning in his eyes. “Fuck,” he growled.
Duncan crashed through the bushes right as Ethan took off and I was left staring up at the stars in confusion.
“Are you okay?” asked Duncan, now at my side, looking down at me. 
“I think so,” I replied, as he helped me up. 
“What in the hell just happened!” hollered Nathan, stumbling through the woods, out of breath.
My lips began to tremble. “I wish I knew.”

Chapter Fifteen


Nathan and Duncan were full of questions as we walked back to the house. I was still in a state of confusion and had a difficult time answering them.
“Who was it?” asked Duncan.
“Where’d they go?” added Nathan.
I shook my head. “I…I just can’t remember.”
It wasn’t exactly true, but my thoughts were so muddled because of my overwhelming attraction towards Ethan. Part of me understood that it wasn’t natural; it was some power he was using to control me. Another part of me didn’t care; I just wanted him to have his way with me, whatever it was.
Nathan scratched his head. “Did you see who it was, Duncan?”
He shook his head. “I was thrown backwards and then she was gone in a flash. It was crazy.”
Nathan scowled. “I don’t even know how to call this one in to nine-one-one. Attempted kidnapping by the invisible man?”
I cleared my throat. “Um, don’t worry about it, Nathan. I’m fine.”
His face darkened. “No, we have to call the police. You could have been murdered or raped.”
It certainly wouldn’t have been rape, I thought. Although, if he was using mind control to make me desire him so much, then it was as bad as a date rape drug. 
“I didn’t see anything. I don’t even know who it was,” I protested. “The cops are going to think we’re all crazy.”
Nathan stared at me for a minute. “Okay, I’d better ask – was it human?”
“To be honest, I don’t know,” I muttered.
Duncan grabbed my hand and squeezed it. “I’m calling my dad to let him know I’m staying over tonight. I’m not letting you out of my sight again.”
Nathan looked at both of us, a funny smile playing on his lips. “Wait a second, did I miss something?” 
I could feel my cheeks turn pink. 
“I guess you could say that I’m kind of falling for your sister,” said Duncan with a sheepish grin. “I hope you’re okay with it.”
Nathan snorted. “I’m fine with it. Now I won’t be the only guy who has to suffer her P.M.S.”
I slugged him in the shoulder. “Very funny, booger.”
“See,” he said, moving away from my fist, which was cocked again. “You have to be very careful around her. She has a mean right hook.”
“Heads-up, your mom’s home,” said Duncan, as we stepped out of the woods.
She was just getting out of the sheriff’s car and he was helping her up the stairs.
“Sheriff, what’s wrong with her?” asked Nathan, looking worried.
Caleb smiled. “She enjoyed one too many glasses of wine again. I brought her home so she could sleep.”
Mom gave us a lopsided grin. “Hi, my babies…”
I groaned.
She was totally hammered and stumbled towards me. “Nikki, I love you.”
Nathan and I put our arms around her and held her up. “Wow, mom,” I grunted, trying to hold her up. “I think it’s time you start laying off the vino.”
Her smile fell. “I didn’t have anything to drink.”
“Sure you did,” interrupted the sheriff. “Don’t you remember the Cabernet you picked out yourself from the wine cellar? We had it with dinner.”
Mom looked confused but then when her eyes met Caleb’s, she smiled wickedly and licked her lips. “All, I remember is dessert.”
“Okay, T.M.I.,” I replied as Nathan and I swung her away from Caleb and into the house. The idea of her and Caleb getting it on was enough to make me want to be celibate for life.
“I’ll call you tomorrow night!” called Caleb from the porch.
“Nikki, can you take care of mom? I’m going to talk to the sheriff,” said Nathan.
I nodded and then proceeded to help her upstairs, which wasn’t an easy task. When we finally made it to her bedroom, she passed out the moment her head hit the pillow. I removed her shoes and covered her up with a sheet as she began to snore.
“Nikki, the sheriff wants to talk to you,” said Duncan, as I closed mom’s bedroom door.
I nodded and took his hand while he led me back downstairs. Both Nathan and Caleb were sitting on the couch.
“So, I heard there was a little excitement here earlier?” asked Caleb. 
I sighed. “I guess you could say that. It was really… bizarre.”
He nodded and took out a notepad. “Could you tell me in your words what happened?”
I gave him my version but left off the part of knowing who the person was that carried me off.
Caleb’s eyes narrowed. “So, you didn’t get a good look at the person at all? Didn’t notice what he was wearing or what he even smelled like?”
Come to think of it, Ethan had smelled like butterscotch. It was very odd, but I didn’t share the information with him. 
I rubbed my arm. “To tell you the truth, I was so scared that I didn’t notice much of anything. I do know that he was as fast as the wind.”
Duncan nodded. “He was quick. He shoved me to the ground, twice, and I didn’t see him either; just a blur of movement. It was freaky.”
Sheriff Caleb put away the notes he was taking and smiled wryly. “You realize how this sounds, don’t you?”
Nathan nodded. “Crazy, I know.”
“Why don’t you show him the video,” said Duncan.
“Oh, yeah,” replied Nathan, grabbing the tape from the fireplace mantel. “We taped this yesterday after someone destroyed all the video surveillance equipment. They apparently missed this one.”
We all watched the video in silence, and when it was over, Caleb let out a long sigh.
Nathan folded his arms across his chest. “Even crazier, huh?”  
He nodded. “I don’t really know what to say about it, actually. It doesn’t really make a lot of sense.”
I cleared my throat. “What should we do?” 
Caleb ran a hand over his face. “Let me take this tape and I’ll show some friends who specialize in paranormal research.”
Nathan’s jaw dropped. “So you think it might be a poltergeist, too?”
He shrugged. “Even I have to admit; it’s some kind of strange phenomenon. I just have no experience with this type of thing.”
“Okay, yeah take it. Let us know what you find out,” said Nathan, giving him the tape.
Caleb stood up and started walking towards the door.
“What about Nikki?” asked Duncan. “How are we supposed to protect her against whatever this thing is?”
Caleb turned back around, his expression grave. “Don’t go anywhere alone, keep your doors locked, and whatever you do, don’t invite any strangers in.”
Chapter Sixteen


Nathan and Duncan slept on my bedroom floor that night, just in case the “specter” came back to harass me. When I woke up, it was just after nine the next morning and I was alone. I went down to the kitchen. 
“Where’s Duncan?” I asked. 
As usual, Nathan was stuffing his face with food. “He had to work. He’s going to pick you up after your shift again tonight. I’ll get mom’s keys and drop you off at four.”
“Did you guys ever figure out what’s wrong with the Mustang?”
He nodded. “It’s the battery. I’m picking up a new one today.”
I yawned. “Where’s mom? Still sleeping?”
He nodded. “Yeah, she’s been doing a lot of that lately. I think she should quit drinking, she just can’t handle it.”
“I agree.”
Plus, she was our mom and really not making a good impression by getting so drunk that she could barely walk.
Two hours later, mom was still sleeping so I decided to check up on her.
“Mom?” I called, knocking softly on her door.
“Yeah,” she mumbled. “Come in.”
She had the blinds pulled shut so I turned on the light.
“You, okay?” I asked her.
She smiled, lazily. “Yeah, just tired.”
I sat down next to her on the bed. “You know, you really need to cool it on the wine, mom. The sheriff is going to think you’re some kind of lush. You never usually drink like this.”
“I didn’t drink anything last night. At least, I don’t remember,” she said with a confused look.
“Oh, come on… mom, you were trashed. I had to help you to bed last night. You had to have been drinking.”
She rubbed a hand over her forehead. “I don’t even remember.”
I sighed and changed the subject. “So, did his daughter make dinner for you?” 
 “I… think so.”
My eyes widened. “You don’t sound so sure.”
She rubbed her forehead. “To tell you the truth, last night was a bit of a blur.”
“I know the feeling,” I said, staring towards her bedroom window. Last night almost felt like a dream. I couldn’t explain my reaction to Ethan or the way he’d whisked me through the darkness the way he did. It didn’t make a whole lot of sense.
“What?” she asked.
I turned back to her and smiled. “Nothing.”
She stood up. “I’ve got so much to do today. I start work on Monday and have more errands than I have hours to complete them.”
“Ahem, thanks for asking… my first day went pretty good, by the way.”
“I’m sorry, honey,” she replied, grabbing a robe from the closet. “I totally forgot. So, your first day at the diner went pretty smooth?”
 “Yeah. I’m working again tonight. In fact, Nathan has to use your car to drop me off at the diner around four. His Mustang needs a new battery.”
She groaned and then nodded reluctantly. “Okay. I’ll just have to take care of some things tomorrow, I guess.”
I motioned towards her neck. “So, how’s your skin?” I asked. 
She touched it and winced. “Still tender.”
I got off the bed and walked over to her. “Did you put anything on it?”
“No. I probably should. How does it look?”
I examined her skin and frowned. It looked much worse. “You should really see a doctor.”
She waved her hand and shook her head. “No, you know me. I’m just allergic to mosquito bites. It usually takes a while for them to heal.”
“At least put something on it, so it doesn’t get infected.”
“Fine, Nurse Nikki,” she said with a wry smile. 
I walked over to the window and opened the blinds. “It’s a beautiful day, mom, you could use some vitamin D on that lily-white skin of yours.”
“Oh, hey… close the blinds,” she gasped holding her hand up to shield her face. “The sun hurts my eyes!”
I quickly closed them. “Wow, you seriously need to lay off the alcohol, mom. Hangovers are a bitch.”
She grabbed her sunglasses from the nightstand and put them on. “Actually, I think I have an eye infection or something,” she said. “They’ve been bothering me the last couple of days.”
I smirked. “Maybe you’re allergic to Caleb. Ever since you’ve been seeing him, you’ve been acting weird.”
She smiled. “It’s definitely not him. He is such a wonderful man. I’m so happy we met. It’s only been a few hours since we we’ve been together, but… I have to admit, I miss him already.”
It sounded like she really was falling pretty hard for the sheriff. “So, when’s the wedding?” I asked.
‘Oh, God, it’s too early for that but I’ll be honest, every time he looks at me,” she sighed and her eyes looked wistful, “I just want to jump his bones.”
I shuddered. “Okay, that’s something I didn’t need to hear. That’s just twisted, mom.”
She laughed. “Oh, just you wait, my dear. You’ll meet someone who makes your toes curl and then you’ll know exactly what I’m talking about.”
I’d already met two guys who made my toes curl but I wasn’t about to tell her that. “Whatever,” I said.
She walked over to me and touched my cheek. “What about Duncan? Any sparks?” 
My cheeks grew pink. “Well… I don’t know. I mean, we’re just friends, you know?”
She smiled, knowingly. “Friends, huh? Just make sure you use protection if he gets too friendly.”
My jaw dropped. “Mom!”
“You are still a virgin, right?”
I couldn’t believe we were actually having this conversation.
“Oh, my God, yes!” I replied, staring at her in horror.
“Although, you don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to. Just be safe.”
“Enough! I’m still a virgin and I plan on staying one for a while.”
Her eyes softened. “That’s what a mother wants to hear. But when things get confusing or too much, you can always come to me with any questions.”
“I’m going to take a shower,” I said. “I feel dirty after talking about it with you.”
She laughed. “You’re such a smartass.”
I left her and went back to my room. Instead of taking a shower, however, I lay down on my bed and thought about everything that had happened the night before. It now seemed so unbelievable, that I wondered if it had been just a dream. 
I closed my eyes and fell asleep.

~~~

“Nikki, come to me,” whispered the smooth, masculine voice in my ear.
I opened my eyes to find that I was in a forest wearing a billowy, white nightgown. I stood up and began walking in my bare feet. As I looked down, I noticed sharp pieces of broken glass cutting into my skin, which was now bleeding.
“Hurry,” prodded the voice. It was strong and demanding; it pushed me forward, one foot after another.
“Nikki!” yelled Duncan.
“Duncan?” I whispered, turning around.
“Wait, Nikki!” he cried, running towards me. I watched in amazement as he kept moving without making any progress.
There was a rush of movement and my heart began to race; I knew who it was. He’d come back for me. “Ethan?” 
Someone grabbed my shoulders and started digging their sharp nails into my skin. I was shoved roughly to the ground and the shadow jumped on top of me. “Amy?” I whispered in horror.
Amy’s eyes were filled with hate. “He’s mine,” she growled, her slit wrists bleeding onto my white dress. She opened her mouth and her pointy fangs closed in on my neck.  

I opened my eyes and let out a shaky breath. Just a dream.
Someone rapped on my door. 
“Hey, twerp!”
“Yeah, come in,” I mumbled, sitting up.
“Get ready,” said Nathan. “I have to drop you off early at the diner. Mom needs the car as soon as I get back from purchasing a battery.”
I looked at my alarm clock. It was already after two o’clock. “Okay,” I said.
His eyes narrowed. “Are you doing okay?” 
“Just a little tired.”
He pointed at me. “Don’t leave the diner after dark unless Duncan is with you.”
“Yeah, okay.”
He stared at me for a minute and then nodded. “I’ll be outside waiting for you. You have a half hour to get ready.”
“Okay, I’ll hurry.”
I took a quick shower, put my uniform on, and spent a little extra time with my makeup. Then I pinned my damp hair up and stared into the mirror. I had to admit, I was definitely beginning to look more like my mother every day. I decided it was a good thing and smiled.
Nathan laid on the horn outside and I rushed out to meet him in mom’s car.
“Makeup, huh? Trying to get more tips?” smirked Nathan.
I shrugged. “I could certainly use the money.”
“I hear you. So, what do you think about last night? Pretty crazy, huh?”
“It was freaky, that’s for sure. I still don’t know what happened, exactly.”
“I’m starting to think we really do have ghosts lurking around the cabin. That could be the real reason why mom’s renting it so cheap.”
“Makes sense.”
We drove the rest of the way in silence and he dropped me off in front of the diner, warning me to stay put when my shift was over.
“You worry too much,” I said. “I’m not going anywhere. I’ll wait for Duncan.”
“Here’s Duncan’s cell phone number,” he said, handing me a slip of paper. “If there’s a problem, call me or him.”
“Okay, thanks.”
When he finally drove off, I went into the diner and ran into Rosie in the back room.
“How’s it going, Nikki?” 
I smiled. “Pretty good. We were really swamped yesterday so Susan didn’t get a chance to show me too much.”
 “Yeah, I heard. Since you’re early, I’ll go over some things with you, myself.”
“Thanks.”
Rosie went over the menus and showed me how to write up meal tickets. Then she gave me some pointers on how to juggle multiple tables and get them in and out as quickly as possible. When we were done, my head was spinning, but I felt like I was starting to get a little handle on things.
“Don’t worry. It’s going to take a while, but you’ll get used to it. And, honey, don’t be afraid to tell the customers you’re new. They’ll have more patience and might even tip you better.”
“Oh, I’m all for that. Thanks.”
“You’ll do just fine here,” she said, patting me on the shoulder. “Just do your best, and eventually things will fall together.”
I smiled in pleasure. “Thanks, Rosie.”
When Susan showed up, I shadowed her for half the day, and then I was given a couple of my own tables. 
“You’re doing great,” said Rosie, after I served a large platter of food to one of my tables. “Keep it up.”
“Thanks.” 
The time flew by quickly and by the time my shift was over, I’d made almost thirty dollars in tips. I was so giddy that I texted Nathan, who was happy for me. 
“Listen, is there any way you can work a little later tonight?” asked Rosie, as I was about to punch out. “We could really use you until eleven o’clock. Darlene called in sick and I need all the help I can get. Since it’s Friday night, we’re going to get slammed soon.”
“Okay. Let me call my ride and let him know. I’m sure it will be fine.”
I grabbed my phone and called Duncan. 
“Okay,” he said, after I explained why they needed my help. “I’ll be there promptly at eleven, though I’ll expect a tip.”
I giggled. “I think I can manage that.”
We had a rush of customers around nine o’clock, and I was running ragged, trying to keep my orders right and not piss anyone off. By the time it was ten-thirty, I heaved a sigh of relief; the diner was finally clearing out.
“We usually get another big rush after the bars close,” said Susan. “Just be thankful you’re not working those customers. When they’re not trying to pick you up, they’re puking in the corner. It’s really disgusting.”
I grimaced. “I bet.”
“Funny thing is, they usually tip better,” she said, “because they’re drunk and feeling extra generous. But, to me, it isn’t really worth it.”
Thinking about my mom last night and practically having to babysit her, I agreed. I then took out my tips and started counting it when Susan swore.
“What?” I said, looking up. 
It was Ethan, followed by his clan. His eyes met mine and he smiled.
“Hey,” whispered Susan, noticing the exchange. “Do you know him?”
“Um, not really,” I said.
“Looks like they’re in your section tonight, Nikki,” said Rosie, “they usually only order coffee, though, so it should be a piece of cake.”
I took a deep breath and walked up to their table.
“Hello,” I said, handing out menus. “Can I start anyone out with something to drink?”
Ethan put his elbows on the table, clasped his fingers, and rested his chin on there. “Coffee for all of us, please, Nikki.”
Remembering the effect he had on me, I averted my eyes. “And will you want food, or should I take away the menus?”
“Well,” chuckled Ethan. “What I want probably isn’t on the menu.”
Oh, my God.
Our eyes met and I swear I could feel a charge of static electricity between us. It was eerie.
“You look beautiful tonight. As usual,” he said softly.
The carnal promises he held in his smoldering eyes were raw and made my heart race. I took a step backwards, trying to catch my breath, and dropped my pen.
“Everything okay here?” interrupted Rosie, coming towards us.
Ethan looked away and I grabbed the back of an empty chair to steady myself.
“Yeah, Rosie,” smiled Ethan. “Just being friendly with the new waitress.”
She smiled. “Now don’t be giving young Nikki here a hard time. It’s only her second day.”
For some reason, Rosie wasn’t affected by Ethan’s magnetic stare.
“Oh, don’t worry about Nikki, Rosie. She’s in good hands with me.”
“That’s what I’m afraid of,” she chuckled. “So, Nikki, why don’t you go pour some coffee for these boys.”
I cleared my throat. “Okay,” 
I grabbed six coffee cups and glanced towards Ethan’s minions. I watched, curiously, as Rosie continued talking to Ethan while the rest of the guys seemed content just listening to the exchange, never actually joining in on the conversation. All were tall, pale, and rivaled any of the male models I’d seen in magazines. None of them compared to Ethan, however. His animal magnetism was enough to make me forget everything else.
“It’s getting late,” said Rosie, coming up to the counter. “Why don’t you let me finish waiting on these guys and you can take off?”
I nodded, not quite trusting myself to talk.
Without another glance towards Ethan, I hurried to the break room, removed my apron, and grabbed my purse. When I turned around, I was staring into Ethan’s sultry eyes.
“Oh,” I gasped.
“Leaving so soon?” he asked me, stepping closer. I moved backwards until my back hit the wall.
“I really have to go,” I squeaked.
He touched my face and his eyes searched mine. “I’ve been searching for so long. I can’t believe that I’ve finally found you.”
My eyes widened. “Excuse me? I don’t understand what you mean.”
“You will.” He closed his eyes and inhaled. “You smell so sweet.”
I was so confused; my head was spinning and my stomach whirled. “I… what’s happening?”
Ethan opened his eyes again and smiled. “You’ll understand… in time.”
Suddenly his mouth was on mine again, and as before, I couldn’t resist his kisses. Our lips moved hungrily together and I moaned in pleasure, wanting him closer. I ran my hands up his back and into his hair, pulling his mouth harder against mine. But then he stopped abruptly and pulled away.
“I… I have to go and take care of something,” he said thickly.
“Your eyes…” I whispered. They were still blue but glowed brightly with something that reminded me of fire.
He backed away from me, breathing heavily. “Leave your balcony door open tonight.”
Then in a flash he was gone and I was left feeling frustrated and more alone then I’d ever felt before.

Chapter Seventeen


“Nikki,” said Rosie, stepping into the break room. “Someone named Duncan is waiting for you in the diner.”
“Thanks,” I replied, trying to compose myself.
Her eyes narrowed. “You okay? You look kind of flushed.”
“I’m fine,” I replied, not able to meet her eyes. 
“Go home and get a good night’s sleep,” she said. “Working here can take a lot out of you.”
I forced a smile. “I will. Thanks.”
I followed her back out and expected to see Ethan and his friends, but they were all gone.
“Hi,” said Duncan.
He was dressed in a light blue polo shirt that complimented his silvery-gray eyes and low-riding jeans that showed off his tight abs. Because I was still feeling the pheromones from whatever Ethan produced, I had an incredible urge to jump his bones.
“Ready?” I asked, grabbing his hand.
He chuckled as I pulled him out of the diner. “What’s wrong? Had enough of this place already?”
I released a heavy sigh and nodded. “It was a long day.”
We both hopped in to his truck and he turned on the music. He caught me staring at him and smiled.
“You look nice,” he said, grabbing my hand.
His smile was much more boyish than Ethan’s and the tenderness in his eyes was so sweet. Part of me was already falling hard for Duncan, while another part of me screamed out for Ethan. It was frustrating and I decided to try and drive away my lustful thoughts of Ethan, so I told him to pull over to the side of the road.
“What’s wrong?” he asked.
I scooted closer to him and pressed my lips against his. Soon we were kissing and my hands were all over him. When I pulled myself onto his lap and looked into his eyes, he let out a shaky sigh. “Nikki,” he groaned, and then his mouth captured mine.  
I ground my hips into his and he moaned with pleasure as I rocked against him. He unbuttoned the top of my uniform and raised my bra, kissing my breasts. Nobody had ever done that before and the sensation made me quiver down below.
“Shit,” he groaned as a squad car pulled up behind us and we were surrounded by bright flashing lights.
I jumped off of him and buttoned my uniform while Duncan tried to compose himself. “Man,” he said, looking at me again. “That was intense.”
There was a tap on the window and we both smiled sheepishly at Sheriff Caleb, who was frowning.
“What’s going on?” he asked. 
Duncan’s face looked so guilty it was comical. “Um, we were just talking.”
He smirked. “You certainly fogged up the windows pretty good with all that talking you must have been doing. Next time, open one up.”
We both smiled. 
“Listen,” said Caleb. “I’m not stupid, so I know your raging hormones probably got the better of you. Next time you feel like making out, though, don’t do it on the side of the road. It’s pretty dangerous, especially at night. Now, Duncan, bring Nikki home before her mom gets worried.”
“Okay. Thank you, sir,” answered Duncan.
He looked at me. “Say hello to your mother for me.”
“Okay.” 
He walked back to his squad car, and we drove to the cabin in an awkward silence. Thankfully, Nathan was waiting on the porch for us when we pulled up because I didn’t want to talk about what had just happened. The truth was, I wasn’t exactly sure myself. That promiscuous girl back there? That wasn’t me. I’d made out with two guys in the last two days and had no real explanation for it.  
“Hey, guys,” said Nathan, who was sitting on a gliding bench with a grim smile.  
Duncan cleared his throat. “What’s up, Nathan?” 
“Read this,” he said, holding out a newspaper.
I grabbed it from him and we both started reading the article he’d circled. There were several pictures of girls who were either missing or dead under the headline: ‘Serial Killer Targeting Similar Victims?’
“They’ve included a picture of the girl who was found in the lake, as well as Amy,” said Nathan, pointing. “See the resemblance there of the two girls?”
“Why is Amy included in this? She killed herself,” I said.
Nathan’s eyes narrowed. “Or maybe it was only made to look like she did. The most disturbing thing about this article is the photos of the girls.”
“They look very similar,” said Duncan. Then he turned to me and tensed up. “In fact, they look similar to Nikki, too.”
My brother nodded. “Their hair is different but, if you look closely at the facial features of those girls, there is a definite resemblance to Nikki’s. What really concerns me, are the strange things that have been happening to her. What if it’s somehow related?”
“Seriously, I doubt it has anything to do with what’s happened to all of those girls,” I said.
“Still, we’d better keep a close eye on you,” replied Nathan. 
“Fine,” I said, yawning. “Listen, I hate to be a party pooper, but I’m exhausted from being on my feet for the last several hours. I’m going to take a bath and then sleep for days, if mom will let me.”
“Do you need any help getting that bath ready?” asked Duncan, smiling.
“Dude, that’s my sister you’re talking about. Don’t say that stuff loud enough for my ears to pick up,” said Nathan, looking horrified.
Duncan laughed. 
“So, Duncan, are you planning on going to the barbeque tomorrow night?” I asked.
“Only if you’re going,” he said, leaning up against the cabin.
I smiled up at him. “Definitely. “
“How about if Nikki and I just meet you there?” interrupted Nathan. “I’ll call you tomorrow afternoon.”
“Sounds good,” he replied.
“Goodnight Dunc,” he said, opening the cabin door. “I’ll give you guys some privacy, in case you want to suck face or something.”
“Funny,” I mumbled.
“Night,” replied Duncan. As soon as Nathan was gone, he stepped closer and stared down into my eyes. “Well, goodnight.”
“Goodnight.
He gave me one of his dimpled smiles and then leaned forward, kissing me tenderly on the lips. This time the kiss was short and sweet.
“Maybe tomorrow I won’t smell like a diner,” I said softly as he stepped back.
“Believe me,” he replied, licking his lips. “I didn’t mind one bit.”
I cleared my throat. “I guess I’ll see you tomorrow then?”
He reached into his pocket, pulled out his keys, and began twirling them around his finger. “Definitely. Can’t wait.”  
“Me, too.
He motioned towards the door. “I’m not leaving until you’re safely inside of the house.”
His concern made me tingle. “Okay. Night.”
“Goodnight.”
I went inside the cabin and locked the door. When I turned around, Nathan stepped out of the kitchen with a bowl of popcorn. 
“Where’s mom?”  
“Where else? Sleeping,” he said, sitting down on the couch.
“Okay, I’m beat, too. I’ll see you in the morning.”
He nodded and flipped on the television.
I checked on mom and found her sprawled out on the bed, snoring softly. I closed the door and went into my room to get ready for my bath. I took out my hair down and set my cellphone on the charger, my head still spinning from everything that happened tonight. The fact that I’d made out with two guys in less than an hour was almost comical for someone like me; I still wasn’t sure what to make of it. In California, I’d shied away from the opposite sex; here, I was totally acting like a slut.
Maybe it’s the fresh air? I mused.
With a yawn, I walked into the bathroom and started the water. My cell phone began to ring and I rushed back into the bedroom to answer it. When I saw who it was, I sat down on the edge of my bed and smiled.
“I just wanted to say goodnight, again,” said Duncan, a smile in his voice. “I… um, miss you already.”
I laughed. “You’ll be seeing me soon enough.”
“Believe me, it won’t be.”
My heart melted. He was the sweetest guy and I told him so. 
“You must bring it out in me,” he replied. “Because, normally, I’m not like this.”
“Really? That’s hard to believe because you’re a natural. I can just tell.”
“Maybe, but I still think it’s you.” He sighed. “Look, this isn’t easy for me, so I’m just going say it. I… I think I’m falling in love with you. Actually,” he paused. “I know I am.”
“You hardly know me,” I said softly, although his words made me giddy. I’d never heard anyone says those words to me and it gave me tingles of pleasure.
“I know. Kind of weird, huh?” 
I lay back on the bed and stared at the ceiling, a wide grin on my face. “No. I, um… actually, I think I’m falling for you, too.” 
“Really?”
He was sweet and made my stomach flutter. I’d never been in love before, but I knew one thing, I felt something special for him. I wasn’t sure if it was love, but it sure felt good.
 “Yeah, really.”
“Okay, I just wanted you to know that I can’t stop thinking about you, and it’s driving me crazy.”
“Was that before or after I attacked you in the truck?”
He chuckled. “Both.”
I burst out laughing.
“Can I pick you up every night?” he teased. “I figure we’ll be at third base if this keeps up.”
“Oh, my God,” I said. “Just for that, I’m sending you back to first base.”
“I’ll take what I can get. We don’t even have to play the bases; we can just wander the fields.”
I laughed again, and it reminded me of my mother with Caleb. I was as pathetic as she was with men.
“Man, I love your laugh.”
My face hurt now, I was grinning so wide. “Thanks.”
“No problem.”
We sat in silence for a few seconds and then I spoke. “It’s late and I was just about ready to take a bath.”
He sucked in his breath. “I’ll be right over.”
“Duncan! I’m hanging up.”
“Wait, are you naked yet?”
I groaned. “Goodnight, Duncan.”
“Just give me something to fantasize about.”
I looked down at the uniform I was still wearing. “Yeah, I’m totally naked, except for the nail polish on my feet.”
He groaned. “You’re killing me.”
“Night,” I said. “This time… for real.”
“Night,” he murmured back.
He waited for me to hang up and I smiled again as I ended the call. One thing was for certain, Duncan was definitely the guy making my toes curl. No doubt about it.
I put my phone back in the charger, eyeing the balcony, suspiciously. The moon was bright, and normally I would have thought it was cool, but right now it was only ominous. There was no way that I was going to unlock the door, even if Ethan could somehow make it up here.
Ethan. 
I didn’t even know him and the conscious side of me knew that my reaction to the guy made no sense. Sure, I’d basically climbed all over him in our break room and his kisses ignited a raging fire inside of me, but the truth was, he scared the crap out of me, crazy sexy or not.
I checked the lock on the balcony door to make sure it was secure, then went back into the bathroom and got undressed. Seconds later, I had the jet streams going in the tub and my back was getting a much-needed water massage. I closed my eyes and soon began drifting off. 
A strange noise jolted me awake, and I looked towards the window, only to find myself alone.  
Must have been dreaming…
Sighing with relief, I checked the time and noticed I’d been in the tub for a half hour. The water was too chilly to enjoy anymore so I decided to get out. I toweled myself dry, put my robe on, and unplugged the bathtub. I then padded into the bedroom where I stopped dead in my tracks. Ethan was on my balcony, leaning against the railing watching me. He reminded me of a predator studying its kill before striking.
Time seemed to stand still as the realization of what Ethan really was sunk in. Obviously, he’d made it up to my balcony all by himself, and yesterday, we’d soared through the night faster than what was humanly possible. There could only be one explanation now, and it chilled me to the bone.
We stared at each other for what seemed like forever and then he pointed to the door.
Swallowing hard, I stepped over and unlocked it. 
“Aren’t you going to invite me in?” he asked softly.
My heart was hammering in my chest and I bit the side of my lip, trying to decide what to do.
“Well?” he asked, smiling devilishly. “I promise I won’t hurt you, Nikki. In fact, I imagine you’ll enjoy my company tremendously.” 
I let out a ragged sigh and nodded.
He stared at my mouth. “I’d like to hear you say it.”
“Come in, Ethan.”
 

Chapter Eighteen


Ethan stepped into my bedroom and I instinctively took a step backwards.
“Are you afraid of me?” he asked with a sardonic grin.
“I… don’t know,” I whispered, as the hair stood up on the back of my neck. Obviously I was lying. He scared the hell out of me.
He took another step towards me, his eyes probing. “Nikki, seriously, you have nothing to be afraid of.”
“Uh, why me?” I squeaked, surprised that I was able to ask any questions at all when what I really wanted to do was run like hell.
Ethan’s lips curled up. “Why not you?”
“I…” I stared at him as my panic began to change into something else entirely – an achy need to be closer to him; to touch and be touched by him. 
What is wrong with me?
He walked over to my bed and sat down. “Come here.”
I moved towards him and he grabbed both of my hands, kissing them with his soft lips. 
“Why you? Because we belong together,” he murmured.
Earlier his skin had felt cool to the touch. It had been the one thing that had surprised me. Now, his cheeks were warm and he held my hands against them, nuzzling them, lovingly.
“But I don’t even know you,” I said. “How can you say that?”
He shrugged. “You do. You just don’t remember.”
“That doesn’t make sense. I just moved here,” I said.
He looked up into my eyes. “Let’s just say we knew each other in another life.”
My eyes widened. “What… like reincarnation?”
His hands tightened on my wrists and he pulled me onto his lap. “Something like that.”
“Seriously?”
Instead of answering me, he leaned forward and captured my lips with his. I closed my eyes, abandoning all logic and caution. Soon we were kissing with as much heat and passion as earlier, this time without fear of being interrupted. When his fingers opened up my robe and began touching my naked body, I gasped with pleasure.
“Ethan,” I breathed, my heart pounding in my chest.
“You’re mine,” he whispered into my neck, making me shiver. “Forever.”
“Sure,” I whispered back as his tongue slid down to my nipple and began teasing it. “Whatever… you… say.”
His hands caressed my breasts and I closed my eyes as his hot mouth continued to make me quiver. Soon, I was making mewling noises and he was breathing as heavily as I was.
“What?” I whispered when he suddenly pushed me away.
“Come with me,” he said in a ragged voice. “I can’t make love to you here. It’s not safe.”
“No, it’s okay. Nobody will know,” I whispered, surprising myself with my own eagerness to give myself to him. 
He closed his eyes. “You’re a virgin and I’m…”
How did he know? Obviously, not from my actions.
“What? It’s okay.”
“Come with me now, Miranda,” he said, opening his eyes and pulling me to him. “It’s time to leave everything else, behind.”
I pulled away. “Miranda?” 
He blinked. “Nikki, come with me and we can be together forever. I’ll never let you go, again.”
“What? I can’t leave my family,” I said. Sure, he was hot and I wanted to feel him touch and kiss me again, but I wasn’t about to leave my family.
He stared into my eyes, and soon I was willing to go anywhere with him. I just wanted nothing more than to be lost in his arms forever. “Come with me,” he prodded, touching my face, lovingly.
I nodded. “Oh, God. Yes.”
Just then the bedroom door was thrown open and my brother stood in the doorway with a shotgun. “Hands off of her, pal. She’s not going anywhere with you!”
Ethan growled and moved away from me as I struggled to adjust my robe.
“Did you just growl at me? Get the hell out of here, Cujo, before I use this thing!” demanded Nathan. “I’ll fucking do it!”
Ethan took a step towards my brother and I yelled, “Ethan, don’t hurt him! Please!”
Somehow deep down, I knew that Ethan had the power to rip Nathan apart with little effort. Even though both of them were similar in size and stature, you could almost feel the power and strength emanating from him. It was both frightening and exciting at the same time. At least for me.  
Ethan looked at me and for a second, I thought he was going to carry me off into the moonlight. Instead, he let out a frustrated groan, and then in a flash, was gone.
“What in the hell was that?” hollered Nathan as he dashed towards the balcony.
“Um, that was Ethan,” I answered, touching my bruised lips. I couldn’t believe how much I wanted him to return. To finish what he’d started. 
Nathan stormed back into my bedroom and ran a hand through his brown hair. “What were you thinking, Nik? That has to be the thing trying to fuck with us. That certainly wasn’t a normal dude who was trying to feel you up, which, by the way, wasn’t at all fair to Duncan!”
A wave of shame spread through me as Duncan’s face popped into my mind. I did love him, didn’t I?
“Listen,” I said firmly. “He has this power to make me do things… I can’t control myself around him,” I shook my head incredulously. “Nathan, God, I seriously think I’d do anything for him if he asked.”
“What?”
“I know,” I said, my eyes misting over. “I couldn’t help it, either. One moment I was fine and the next, we were making out and I did nothing to stop it.”
His eyes narrowed. “Mind control?”  
I wiped a tear from my eye, my emotions all messed up.  “Yes.”
“So, do you honestly believe he’s a vampire?”
“Yes, Nathan, I do.” My mind was beginning to clear, and now there was little doubt in my mind that he actually was a vampire.
He leaned forward. “Did he suck your blood or anything?”
I touched my neck. “He didn’t bite me. At least… not that I remember.” I ran over to the mirror and checked my neck. “See, it looks normal.” Remembering our mother’s neck, I covered my mouth in horror. “Oh, my God… mom! She has that thing on her neck! Remember?”
We both flew out of the bedroom and began knocking on her door. 
“Come in,” she called.
Her room was dark except for a candle burning slowly on the nightstand.
“Hey,” I said, in a low voice. “Um, sorry to bother you. We were just wondering if we could check those bites on your neck. To make sure they aren’t infected.”
She rolled over and gave us an exasperated sigh. “You woke me up in the middle of the night to check my neck?”
“Sorry,” said Nathan. “Um, we saw this news report about these mosquito bites that get really inflamed if you don’t care for them correctly.”
“Yeah,” I said. “If you don’t clean them good… um, eggs will grow in your neck.”
She sat up and shrieked. “What?! Eggs! Look and see if anything is growing in my neck!”
Nathan bit back a smile as we stepped closer to examine mom’s neck. 
“Fine, I’m convinced,” he whispered, looking at me. “Check it out.”
I was, too. The swelling had gone down but the two holes could have definitely been caused by a vampire. Not that either of us were experts, but we’d watched enough horror flicks to know what we saw. 
“Mom, we have to talk to you,” I said, stepping back. “I know this is going to sound crazy but you have to believe us.”
She looked at both of us. “Okay, spill it. What’s on your minds?”
We started over from when we’d spoken to Amy, her warnings, and how she’d killed herself. Then, I told both of them how I met Ethan and how he’d called me Miranda and had almost made me run away with him.
She threw her head back and laughed. 
“It’s not funny, mom,” said Nathan. “This Ethan guy looked like he was ready to attack me tonight and I had to use a gun to scare him away.”
“Nathan, I doubt the gun would have killed him, anyway,” I said. “He only left you alone because I told him to.”
“Whatever,” he snapped. “This guy is some kind of monster. Whether it’s a vampire or demon. He flies, he growls – he isn’t normal!”
She threw her hands up in the air. “It’s… I don’t know how to react to this. I can’t just accept the fact that you both think this kid is a vampire. As far as my neck goes, I’ve never met Ethan, so if you think he bit my neck when I was having a cup of coffee and didn’t notice, you have another thing coming.”
“Do you feel different at all?” I asked.
She glared at me. “For Heaven’s sake, Nikki! I’m not going to turn into a damn vampire!”
Nathan and I looked at each other. We knew it was pointless to keep trying to convince her that there were vampires in Shore Lake. Unless she saw it for herself, there was no way she was going to believe us. Nathan had reacted the same way.
She rubbed her temples and then stared at us, again. “Look, I’m going back to bed and I suggest that the both of you do the same thing. In the morning, you’ll both realize how crazy this sounded.”
I sighed. “Okay.”
“Goodnight, mom,” said Nathan.
“I love you both, but if you wake me up to talk about vampires again, I’m getting rid of cable!”
 

Chapter Nineteen



“Okay, I’m not leaving you alone anymore,” said Nathan as he paced back and forth in the kitchen. We were both too shook up to sleep.
“Fine,” I said, taking a sip of coffee.
He wagged his finger. “We should talk to mom and see if she’s willing to move back home, too.”
My jaw dropped. “But what about Duncan and our new jobs?”
“What about… there’s a vampire after you, Nikki? Or should we call you ‘Miranda’?”
I sighed. “What if he follows us anyway? He said he’s been looking for me and now that he’s found me, we are supposed to be together.”
“How romantic,” snickered Nathan. “If you ask me, I think he just wants to get into your pants.”
“He almost did,” I mumbled.
“Good thing I heard those groans and whimpers coming from your room, which was gnarly, by the way. Do you know how disturbing it is to hear your sister getting it on with a vampire?” He shuddered. “It’s sick.”
I smiled. “Thank you for being a nosy brother, Nathan. You probably saved my life. At least, my virginity.”
“Thank my stomach. If it wasn’t for mom’s leftover pasta salad calling to me in the fridge, we wouldn’t be having this conversation.”
“Probably not.”
He sat down by the counter. “I just don’t know what else to do. You know, I wonder if we should see if Abigail is still in town. She might have some ideas. She’s the only other person who’d believe us.”
“We should probably go and pay her a visit in the morning,” I said.
He looked at his watch. “The sun will be up soon. I’m going to grab my sleeping bag and camp out in your room for the next few nights. Hopefully, that horny vampire gives up and decides to go after someone else.”
“Oh, my God,” I whispered in horror. “What if he killed all of those girls in the paper? You said they were all similar looking. Maybe he was looking for me?”
He snorted. “Or worse yet, you are not the real Miranda and he decides to kill you when he figures it out.”
I glared at him. “Oh, thanks, Nathan. Just when I think it can’t get any worse.”
“Hey, I’m just trying to keep everything in perspective. I mean, we shouldn’t rule anything out,” he said with a yawn.
His yawn triggered one from me. “True, but I hope you’re wrong,” I said as we headed out of the kitchen and back upstairs.
Ten minutes later, Nathan was snoring on the floor but I was still awake. I stared at the door to my balcony, which was now closed and locked. Part of me still longed for Ethan and I wondered if I’d have the strength to say no if given the chance to surrender to him again.

Chapter Twenty


“Wake up, Princess of Darkness,” teased my brother the next morning.
“Very funny,” I mumbled. I looked at my alarm clock to find it was already after eleven o’clock.
“I talked to Duncan already,” said Nathan, between bites of a banana. “We’re supposed to meet him at the marina around four o’clock.”
I yawned. “Did you tell him about last night?”
“I told him some things but left out the part where you were sitting on Ethan’s lap, panting away.”
I groaned. “It was pretty bad. I’m so disgusted with myself.” 
“You were certainly enjoying it last night.” He grimaced. “Heck, I was the one disgusted.”
“Come on, you know very well that it wasn’t me, last night. Aren’t I typically the frigid and shy twin?” 
His lips curled up. “True. I’m usually the one fighting off the opposite sex.”
I got out of bed. “I’m taking a shower now. At least you don’t have to follow me everywhere during the day. Vampires don’t like the daylight.”
“As far as we know,” he said. “But this is real life. I wouldn’t count anything out.”
“I’ve only run into Ethan at night. In fact, he usually hangs out at the diner after dark.”
His eyes narrowed. “What in the hell does he order? Steak Tartare?”
I grimaced. “Gross, no, he only orders coffee; he and his five friends.”
“Oh, hell, more vampires?” 
“I think so, although the others never say a word. They just sip coffee and stare at the rest of the customers.”
“Probably planning a strike.”
“I wouldn’t doubt it. Look, I’m taking a shower. I’ll meet you downstairs in a little while. Is mom awake?”
His face darkened. “No, that’s another thing that’s still bothering me. This isn’t like her, at all.”
“I know. We’d better keep an eye on her. Maybe give the sheriff a heads-up, too,” I said.
“He already thinks we’re nuts,” said Nathan. “Can you imagine if we tell him about last night?”
I bit my lower lip. The sheriff would never believe us. “Let’s keep it to ourselves, for now.”  
“We’re going to have to.”
Nathan left my room and I took a hot shower. When I was done, I slipped on a white sundress and a pair of sandals. After I dried my hair and added a little makeup, I stared at the results and frowned. I definitely looked like I was going on a date.
I’m doing it solely for Duncan, I told myself. 
“You getting dolled up for Duncan or trying to catch a vampire?” joked my brother when I stepped into the kitchen.
I scowled. “For your information, I am doing it for Duncan.”
“Wow, you look very fresh and lovely this morning,” said mom as she walked into the kitchen.
I smiled. “Thanks, mom. By the way, it’s the afternoon, now.”
She removed her sunglasses and looked at the clock. Her face fell. “Oh.”
“Your eyes still bothering you?” I asked.
She nodded. “I have an eye appointment today. I was lucky to get one on a Saturday.”
“I thought the entire town would be shut down with everything going on,” replied Nathan.
“What do you mean?” she asked.
“The town barbeque thingy,” I said. “We’re meeting Duncan there later this afternoon. Want to join us, mom? It should be a lot of fun.”
“Yeah, actually, I do.” Her eyes lit up. “Maybe I’ll see Caleb there.”
“He’s the sheriff. He’s probably heading up the security,” said Nathan.
“I’m sure. I’ll probably just meet you both there after my eye appointment. Keep your cell phone on so I can find you.”
“Just call me when you’re done and we’ll come look for you, mom,” said Nathan.
“Okay. This should be fun,” she said, turning on the coffeemaker.  
“Either of you want eggs?” asked Nathan, opening the fridge. “I don’t know about you two, but I’m craving a late breakfast.”
“No, that’s okay,” she replied, picking out one of her gourmet coffees from the carousel on the counter. “I’m hungry, but nothing sounds good. I think I’m just going to grab a bite in town before my exam.”
Nathan and I looked at each other, both of us obviously wondering the same thing, was she craving something rare and bloody?
“Nikki, are you hungry?” asked mom.
“Uh, just some toast.”
“Okay.”
Mom made some for me and then took off with her coffee, while Nathan made himself a monster omelet. After watching him down a half dozen eggs while I nibbled on my toast and jelly, we decided to take a drive over to Abigail’s, to see if she was still in town.
“I think this is her place,” he said as we drove up the dirt road to the next cabin over. It was older and much smaller than the one we were staying at, but kept up nicely. With all of the flowers and shrubs surrounding the cabin, it seemed inviting. 
“Yeah, there’s her truck,” I pointed next to the cabin. “Obviously she didn’t skip town just yet. Lucky for us.”
We got out and walked up to the porch. I could hear a dog barking somewhere inside and smiled. “At least we know she’s not living alone.”
“I don’t blame her,” said Nathan, swatting at a mosquito. “Not with Ethan and his band of freaks flying around at night. Hell, maybe we should consider getting a dog.”
“Something tells me a dog isn’t going to frighten a vampire,” I said. “If anything, it might put the dog’s life in grave danger.”
“No doubt,” he replied, ringing the doorbell. We waited and rang it again, but nobody answered. 
“Maybe she’s fishing on the dock?” I asked. 
He stared over my head towards the side of the cabin and nodded. “Good thinking. Let’s go check it out.”
We went around to the back and looked out towards the lake, but there was still no sign of anyone.
I looked up at Nathan and frowned. “You know, I’m getting this creepy feeling, that something isn’t right.” 
“Don’t get all paranoid, Nik. She’s probably taking a walk or over at a friend’s nearby.”
“Yeah. Let’s hope so.”
We walked to the back door, and this time, I pounded on it. When nobody answered, I looked through a small kitchen window and saw a dog sitting inside in a kennel, whining.
“Aw… poor thing. She’s got her Golden Retriever caged up. Maybe Abigail really is getting ready to leave town, today.”
He scraped his teeth over his lower lip and nodded. “Makes sense. Heck, I’m surprised she’s still here.” 
“Let’s wait on the porch for a little while,” I said, walking towards the front of the cabin again. “If she is heading out, we need to catch her beforehand.”
We both sat down on the wooden rockers on the porch and stared pensively towards the dirt road. After about fifteen minutes, I glanced back at her empty truck and sighed. “Something isn’t right, Nathan. I just have this horrible, horrible feeling.”
He stood up. “I know. I’m wigging out a little here, myself. You know, she’s pretty old. What if she had a stroke or heart attack, and is lying inside, unable to move?”
I rose to my feet, too. “Oh crap. Check the door.”
Nathan reached for the handle, and it opened easily. He stuck his head inside. “Hello? Abigail? It’s Nathan from the next cabin over!”
Nobody answered.
“Keep going,” I said.
We stepped inside and were immediately engulfed in a smell that made me want to puke.
“What’s that smell?” I whispered in horror, stopping in my tracks. It was worse than garbage that’s been baking in the sun and dog shit – combined. 
“Oh, hell, I don’t know. Let’s go find her bedroom,” he mumbled, his hand over his nose. “Just stay behind me.”
We searched the cabin until we found a room that appeared to be her bedroom. On the full-sized bed were two open suitcases and piles of women’s clothing, ready to be packed.
I looked at Nathan. “What now?” 
“Kitchen.”
I followed him out of the bedroom and we both gasped in horror the moment we entered the kitchen. On the floor, next to the refrigerator, lay Abigail – her neck ripped open and her lifeless eyes fixed on the ceiling. We both shrieked and then ran like hell out of the cabin, back to his Mustang.
“Oh, my God, we have to call the cops!” I cried. “That was horrible!” 
“Did you see her eyes?” he choked, his face whiter than my dress. He pulled his phone out and dialed nine-one-one. After he hung up with the police, he started the engine.
Dizzy and afraid of puking, I opened my window to let some fresh air in. “I guess there’s no question that vampires are involved, now, is there?”   
“Hell no. Let’s get out of here and call mom when we get back to the cabin. The police told me to stick around, but screw that. They know where to find us.”
“I agree.”
He kicked up rocks as we peeled out of the driveway and I closed my eyes, trying to get the image of Abigail’s body out of my head. If Ethan was responsible for that, there was no way in hell I’d want to see him again. As far as I was concerned, it was time to talk mom into leaving town.
 

Chapter Twenty-One


A squad car stopped by our cabin an hour later, asked us several questions, and then left. Because we didn’t want to sound crazy, we didn’t mention a word about vampires. 
“That must have been so horrifying,” said mom, who’d stopped back home after we’d called to let her know what had happened. 
“Her throat was torn apart, mom,” said Nathan. “There was blood everywhere. It was just… crazy.” 
Sighing, she picked off a piece of lint from her jean skirt. “Maybe it was a bear or a mountain lion that attacked her.”
Nathan’s face darkened. “Or maybe it was a vampire.”
She groaned. “You’re not going to start with that business, again, are you?”
He sighed. “Look, you know us. We aren’t making it up, mom. This Ethan dude, he literally flew out of Nikki’s room.”
“He’d better think twice before he sneaks into your sister’s bedroom, again.”
He smiled grimly. “Mom, if we aren’t careful, they’ll be bloodsucking lovers for the rest of eternity. No lie.”
Mom burst out laughing. “You’re so melodramatic.”
I knew she still wouldn’t believe the vampire story, and part of me didn’t blame her. I was still having a hard time accepting it, myself.
“Listen,” she said, looking down at her watch. “I’m going to be late for my eye appointment if I don’t leave. Are you both still going to this town barbeque?”
Nathan and I looked at each other.
“We should,” I told him. “Duncan’s expecting us and I’m afraid that Ethan is coming back later. He might hurt you.”
“Nikki, if you think someone is going to hurt your brother, then you call the police right away!” snapped mom. “I mean, seriously!”
“Mom,” said Nathan. “The police can’t stop this guy.” 
She rubbed her forehead. “Well, we’ll talk about this later. I’ll see you at in town. Have your cell phones on you.”  
After mom left us, I called Duncan and told him about finding Abigail.
“No shit? I wonder if Ethan was responsible for killing her.”
“I don’t know. I mean, he didn’t actually seem like a killer to me.”
Duncan paused. “Even so, if I catch that guy anywhere around you, I’m going to pound his head in.”
I smiled. “You’d do that for me?”
“Damn right,” he replied. “As far as I’m concerned, you’re my girl now.”
“I like that sound of that,” I replied, softly.
“Oh, hell, my dad’s calling me. Look, I’ll see you guys around four o’clock. Call me if you have any problems. I can’t wait to see you. I thought about you all night.”
“Me too,” I replied, although I’d been thinking about how I’d pretty much cheated on him, even though I’d been a victim myself. I only hoped that he wouldn’t find out about it. He was such a sweet guy and didn’t deserve to be hurt.  
As I hung up, Nathan walked out of the kitchen with some garlic and told me to try and find the cross necklace that my father had given me.
“I lost it,” I said with a grim smile, “last summer.”
He sighed. “You know, I never thought I’d meet someone more dangerous to us than our dad.”
“We don’t know for sure if Ethan killed our neighbor or those girls.”
Nathan scowled. “Don’t start making excuses for this…thing.”
“He has friends. Maybe one of them killed Abigail?”
“Just stop, okay? Ethan is no good for you. If he has killed people, then you have to stay away from him.”
“I know,” I said.
“Rub some of this garlic on your wrists,” he said, holding it out.
I backed away. “Yeah, right. I’m not going to walk around smelling like pizza, especially walking through crowds of people.”
He shrugged. “Fine then, let’s just go.”
Twenty minutes later, we arrived in town and parked at the marina. Duncan was waiting for us in the shop.
“Hey, Duncan,” said Nathan.
“Hey, Nathan.”
Duncan walked over and put his arms around me. “Are you okay?”
I nodded. 
He tilted my chin up and stared into my eyes. “I’m not leaving your side anymore. Not until this guy is behind bars. Or… whatever the hell he is.”
I nodded.
“Wow, you look… beautiful,” he said. “I’d better keep my eyes on you.” Then he brushed my lips with his.
“Let’s get going, I’m starving,” interrupted Nathan.
Duncan smiled and put his arm around my shoulders as we started walking towards the town festival. 
“Wow, they really go all out,” said Nathan.
Large tents and carnival rides were set up in the park and the smell of succulent barbequed meat and corndogs drifted through the air. Crowds of people were already stuffing their faces, standing in line for the rides, or chasing after their kids. 
Nathan groaned. “I’m starving, lead me to the chow.”
A half hour later we were sitting at a picnic table watching Nathan devour his second helping of ribs and listening to some band play old time rock-n-roll songs. Nathan’s cell phone began to ring. He licked his fingers and answered the phone. 
“Mom’s on her way,” he said after hanging up.
“Nikki!”
I looked up and saw Susan walking over. I introduced her to Nathan and Duncan.
“I thought you had to work today?” I asked her.
“No. They closed down for the day because of the festival, thank goodness,” she answered.
“Did you eat yet?” asked Nathan, sliding over to make room for her at the picnic table. 
She shook her head. “No, but that’s okay. I’m going to get something later.”
“You can sit down with us. I don’t bite,” he said, his lips curling up. “Unless you want me to.”
Susan blushed and sat down next to him.
I smiled in amusement as Nathan began teasing her some more. Susan looked totally different out of uniform and reminded me a little of a younger Jennifer Aniston. My brother must have liked what he saw, because he was totally laying on the charm.
 “So, do you know this Ethan character?” asked Nathan after a while.
“I only know that he pursued Amy and she had this notion he was a vampire.”
“Did she say why she thought he was a vampire?” asked Duncan.
She shrugged. “Just that he only came out at night and had this power to make her do whatever he wanted. It freaked the hell out of her.”
“So, did he ever try hitting on you?” asked Nathan. 
She stared at her clasped fingers. “No, but I went out with one of his friends a couple of times.”
My eyes widened. “You went out with one of the guys he comes in with at night?”
“Not one of them. I went out with Drake, who was more of a loner. Then, he kind of just fell off of the face of the earth. He used to come in at night alone and we’d go out after my shift. Then one night, he just never came back. I tried calling him but he never even returned my calls.”
“Did you really think he was a vampire?” I asked.
She shook her head. “No. I mean he was kind of intense and kept weird hours, but of course he wasn’t a vampire. There’s no such thing, right?”
Nathan and I stared at each other, but didn’t respond.
“Did you ever go to his house?” asked Duncan.
“We stopped by once, but he made me wait outside. He lived with Ethan and the others; they rent this house on the edge of town.”
“You didn’t think it was weird that he made you wait outside?” I asked.
She shook her head. “Not really. Besides, Ethan and the others really creep me out. Drake was different, though. I wish I knew what happened to him.”
“Did you ask Ethan?” I said.
She made a face. “Yeah but he didn’t say much. Personally, I think he went back home to Australia. He talked about his family a lot and how he missed them.”
My eyebrows shot up. “He was Australian?”   
She nodded and got this dreamy look on her face. “Yeah, he had this neat accent. Man, I miss that guy.”
Duncan cleared his throat. “So you know where Ethan lives?”
“Yes.”
“Maybe we should call the sheriff and tell him we think Ethan’s responsible for those murders?” said Nathan.
Susan’s jaw dropped. “You seriously think that Ethan is responsible?”
“We don’t know for sure,” I said.
Nathan scowled. “As far as I’m concerned, he’s responsible for something.”
Embarrassed, I looked away. I’d let Ethan into my bedroom and allowed him to do those things to me. What was even worse was that I’d enjoyed it, and wasn’t even certain that I had regrets. 
Was he a murderer?
 I didn’t want to believe it.
“Here comes mom,” said Nathan, standing up. He waved and she walked over.
“So, what did the eye doctor say?” I asked. She was still wearing her sunglasses.
She shrugged. “He prescribed some eye drops for me. He thinks it might be an eye infection, but doesn’t know for sure. If the drops don’t work then I’m supposed to come back in five days for more tests.”
“Hopefully you won’t have to wear your sunglasses to work on Monday.”
She smiled. “Now that would be awkward, wouldn’t it? So,” she looked around. “Have you seen Caleb, yet?” 
I shook my head. “No. Did you call him?”
“I did, but he never answers during the day. He says it’s because he’s so busy. I just hope it’s not something else.”
“Like what? Another woman?” I asked.
She smiled, sheepishly. “Yeah, maybe.” 
“Are you talking about Sheriff Caleb?” asked Susan.
“Yeah,” I said.
“He’s definitely not married,” she said. “He has a daughter who just graduated, Celeste. His wife died a few years ago.”
“That’s what he told me, too,” said mom.
“So what’s the sheriff’s daughter like?” I asked.
“Oh, I forgot to tell you! The redhead we saw on our first day in town… the cute one? That’s Celeste.”
“The hot one?” asked Nathan.
“Yes, Nathan. ‘The hot one’,” she said with a smile.
Nathan turned to Susan. “No offense, Susan. You’re really hot, too.”  
Susan’s cheeks turned bright red again. 
“Hey, here comes my dad,” said Duncan, waving his hand.
Sonny walked over with a plate of food and sat down next to mom. He smiled. “Hi, I’m Duncan’s dad… you must be Nikki and Nathan’s mom? I’m Sonny and I’m going to apologize right now for making a pig out of myself.”
Mom laughed. “I’m Anne. That’s quite all right. I’m used to it, Nathan eats round the clock.”
“I have to be back at the marina in fifteen minutes so I have to eat fast.”
I watched as my mom and Sonny began talking about some yacht he was currently fixing.
“How fascinating,” she said. “I’ve always wanted a ride on a beautiful yacht.”
He smiled. “Come on by the marina sometime and I’ll take you out on a couple. I own a fifty-foot carver myself, and haven’t had a chance to take it out much this summer. You’d give me a reason to start the engine.
My mom’s face lit up. “That sounds wonderful.”
“I’d better get back,” he said, standing up. “It was nice meeting you, Anne. Susan, I’ll see you at the diner again, I’m sure.”
“See you, Mr. Hamilton,” answered Susan.
“I probably won’t be home until late,” said Duncan.
Sonny’s eyes narrowed. “That’s right. Call me if you need me.”
When Sonny left, mom smiled. “Your dad seems very nice, Duncan.”
“Thanks.” 
She looked at me. “And cute, too.”
I laughed. He was pretty hot for an older guy.
Nathan stood up. “Anybody interested in going on some rides? Susan?”
“Sure,” she answered.
“Duncan, how about some rides?” I asked.
He nodded. “Let’s go.”
“I’m going to be taking off,” said mom. “Caleb’s supposed to be stopping over after work. I don’t see him patrolling around here anyway.”
There were a few cops wandering around but I hadn’t seen Caleb around either.
“Okay, bye, mom,” I said.
“Don’t stay up too late,” said Nathan.
“Same goes for you, dad,” she replied.
We purchased some carnival tickets and then spent the next couple of hours screaming on the rides. I watched in amusement as Nathan pretended to be frightened and hugged Susan for comfort.
“They seem to be hitting it off,” said Duncan as we got on the Ferris wheel by ourselves.
“Yeah.”
Duncan’s face darkened. “So, what exactly happened between you and Ethan?”

Chapter Twenty-Two

“Not much,” I lied. 
His eyes narrowed. “Nathan mentioned he was in your bedroom?”
“Yes. He knocked on the door and I opened it. I’m not even sure why I did. He has this way of manipulating people. You heard Susan.”
“He’d better leave you alone or I’ll manipulate his face,” he said. He then put his arms around me and drew me close.
I smiled in pleasure as his lips closed in on mine. Within a matter of seconds, I’d forgotten all about Ethan and was kissing Duncan back as hungrily as he was kissing me. Then the ride was ending, and we were forced to pull apart
“What are you doing to me?” he murmured. 
I’d certainly felt his excitement brush against me and decided it was probably better that the ride had ended when it did.
“So, Duncan, how many girls have you been with?’
He looked at me in surprise. “Is it important?”
“No, not really.”
“If it makes you feel better, I’ve only been with one other girl. We went out for a few months when I was living with my mom, in Minnesota.”
“Do you miss her?”
He grabbed my hand and squeezed it. “You’re all I care about, Nikki. I’ve never felt this way about anyone.”
I smiled and kissed him.
“What about you?” he asked, when I pulled away.
I blushed. “Actually, I’m a virgin.”
He raised his eyebrows.
“What?”  
“You are?”
I scowled. “Yeah, why? Do I seem easy to you or something.”
He burst out laughing. “No! I’m sorry. You just know how to…”
I smiled wickedly. “Excite you? You’re a guy. It’s not too difficult to figure out.”
“So, you’re really a virgin?” he said, rubbing the bottom of his chin. “Hmm…I’d better be careful then. You’re like a delicate flower that needs to be handled with kid gloves.”
I snorted. “Yeah right!”
“Okay, maybe I should tell you to be careful with me.”
“Maybe, you should.”
He smiled as the Ferris wheel stopped at the ground and then helped me down.
“There’s Nathan and Susan,” I said, pointing towards the ticket booth. They were apparently going on more rides.
“Would you like to go on more rides?” he asked, pulling out his wallet.
“Actually, I have to use the ladies’ room,” I said, looking around.
He nodded. “I’ll come with you.”
We walked towards the beach where there was a public restroom open for the festival, which was good because I hated using the satellites.  
“Do you want to take a walk by the beach?” he asked when I was finished.
I looked towards the beach. It was dusk and now deserted. “Sure.”  
We walked towards the lake and I took off my sandals so I could dig my toes in the sand.
“Now that I’ve got you alone…” he grinned, grabbing my arm and pulling me close.
Duncan was almost a foot taller than me and I stood on my tippy toes to meet his lips. We started kissing and then I remembered.
“Wait,” I said. “It’s getting dark. We shouldn’t be out here alone.”
He snorted. “Listen, if Ethan shows up, I’ll knock his lights out.”
Duncan would have been a formidable adversary for anyone, but not for whatever kind of creature Ethan was. There was no question in my mind about that.
“Duncan, he’s not normal. Remember how he grabbed me and ran through the woods? Even you can’t compete with that.”
He sighed. “Fine. Just one more kiss and we’ll head back.”
I slid my arms around his neck and we began kissing, again. Just when my legs began to feel like jelly, he released me.
“Hey,” I pouted as I opened my eyes.
“Well, well, well,” chuckled Ethan. “You’re a naughty little vixen, aren’t you?”
Duncan lay on the ground, obviously unconscious. I rushed to his side and looked up at Ethan. “What did you do to him?!” I yelled. 
He sighed. “Don’t worry he’s just taking a little nap. I should have killed him for even touching you.”
“Ethan, you have to stop this. I’m not Miranda.”  
He grabbed my hand and lifted me up. “You are Miranda. I can see it in your eyes, the way you smell, how you taste…” he murmured, looking into my eyes.
My heart began to race as he bent his head and began kissing me. A wave of hot pleasure shot through my body and I released a strangled moan.
Just then, Duncan came back to his senses. “Leave her alone, you asshole!” he raged, trying to get Ethan away from me.
Ethan’s eyes burned with fury and I watched in awe as he let out an unearthly roar. Before I could do anything, he held Duncan in the air by his throat.
“Please, stop!” I sobbed, rushing towards them. I started hitting Ethan in the back, but it was like hitting a plate of steel. He used his other hand and pushed me to the ground.
Duncan’s eyes were bugging out of his head and his face was turning purple. I knew he would die if I didn’t do something.
“Ethan!” I screamed, getting back up. I hit him repeatedly with my fists, but he continued to ignore me. It was only when a group of men began racing towards us that he swore and released Duncan.
“Let’s go, now,” ordered Ethan. 
I backed away from him and then turned to run. Before I could take five steps, I was in his arms and we were racing across the beach like a flash of lightning. 
“No…” I sobbed as the lights from the carnival became a blur. 


Chapter Twenty-Three

 
I woke up in a cool, dark bedroom. Candles lit up the room and rock music played softly in the background. 
I sat up. “Duncan?” I mumbled, “Nathan?”
Someone sighed and I found Ethan watching me from the shadows. He sat in a leather club chair that had been pushed into the corner of the room.
“So, you’re finally awake,” he murmured.  
I swallowed. “Where am I?” 
“Welcome to my humble abode,” he chuckled. He was naked from the waist up and my mind turned traitor once again as I imagined running my fingers over his impressive pecs.
What in the hell was wrong with me?!
I forced my lustful thoughts aside and tried to concentrate on Duncan and whether or not he was safe.
“Take me home,” I demanded, scooting to the edge of the bed. “Please.”
His eyes studied me intently, but he didn’t respond.
I stood up and smoothed down my dress. “Seriously, take me home,” I said, lifting my chin.
Ethan stood up and walked towards me. His eyes lowered to my dress and I suddenly felt naked. I wondered if vampires had x-ray vision.
I put a hand to my chest and looked up at him. “Ethan?” 
“You are home,” he replied, his voice husky. I backed away and he grinned. “Are we playing hard to get, now?” 
I ignored the question. “Look, this is insane. You can’t just keep me here like a prisoner.”
His eyes hardened. “Prisoner? If you want to leave, you’re certainly free to go.” He then stood sideways so that I could move around him to the doorway. 
Holding my breath, I decided to go for it. Before I could take two steps, however, he grabbed both of my hands and had them behind my back before I had a chance to exhale.
“You know you want to be with me,” he said, smiling darkly. “In every way.”
I stared up into eyes that hinted of things I’d only fantasized about, and shamefully, my resistance fell apart. 
Yes, I wanted Ethan…
In fact, from the tingling sensation growing between my legs, I wanted him every way and everywhere. 
One of his large hands slid into my hair, cupping the back of my head. “Let me,” he whispered seductively, his breath hinting of butterscotch once again, “please you.”
Oh, my God…
My eyes lowered to his mouth and I licked my lips, remembering how good they’d felt on my skin. The next thing I knew, he had me on the bed, pressing against me, and I surrendered all control, gasping in guilty pleasure. Within seconds I was returning his kisses as passionately as he was giving them.
“Yes,” he growled, against my mouth as my hands traveled along his back to his hair. I tightened my fingers around the strands and pulled him closer, kissing him deeper as hot waves of desire shot through my veins, urging me on.
More… I wanted more…
I wrapped my legs around his waist, this time holding him captive as our pelvises moved together in a rhythm that soon had me whimpering in pleasure.
Suddenly, he stopped and his body tensed up.
“What?” I asked, staring up at him.  
He closed his eyes and his jaw tightened.
“What did I do?” I whispered, touching his cheek.
He opened his eyes and they seemed to burn right into my soul. I stared in awe as a fire ignited around his irises and grew into flames. 
My eyes widened. “Are you okay?”
He touched my cheek with his finger, drawing circles. “I’m fine… and you’ve done nothing but… make me want you more than ever,” he whispered. “I just needed a second to regain my control.”
“Oh.”
“Now, where were we?” he asked as his fingers moved down my neck and across my chest. Before I could respond, the front of my dress was ripped open and his mouth was on my skin.
“Oh,” I moaned as his tongue trailed wet kisses to my nipples, teasing and driving me insane with desire. 
“You’re so beautiful,” he whispered, cupping my breasts as his mouth moved upwards. When I realized where he stopped, I tensed up, wondering what would happen next. 
Was he actually going to bite me? And worse, would I care?
His tongue stroked the skin near my collarbone and then moved up towards my ear, nibbling and licking. As I began to relax, his right hand released my breast and his fingers moved down my ribcage, across my bellybutton to my panties, stopping right at the edge of the cotton.  
“Invite me in,” he whispered against my neck.
“Yes…” I whispered, my legs trembling.
He ran one of his fingers over the top of the material and I gasped. “Say it…” he demanded.
“Come in, Ethan…”
Just as his fingers began to slide under the fabric, the door burst open and he shot up. His face was a mask of monstrous rage and my heart stopped as I saw his fangs for the first time. “What is the meaning of this?!” he growled.
Sheriff Caleb stood facing us while I pulled the blankets over my exposed body. His face was burning red, as were his homicidal eyes. “Why in the fuck did you bring her here?!”  
Chapter Twenty-Four


They’d locked me in the bedroom but I could still hear their angry shouts from somewhere in the house. Caleb said he had to bring me back, but Ethan raged that I belonged with him. I wanted to go home desperately and prayed that Ethan would give in and release me. 
There was a soft knock at the door and then it opened. An attractive red-haired girl entered the room, who I only assumed was Celeste, Caleb’s daughter. This time she wasn’t wearing glasses and her startling green eyes stared at me with interest.
“Here,” she said, throwing me a pair of shorts and T-shirt. “I heard you needed this.”
I stared at her, wondering if she was a vampire, too. 
“Yes,” she said with a sardonic grin. “I am whatever it is you think I am.”
“What, you can read minds?” I asked.
She laughed. “No, I could tell what you were thinking by the expression on your face.”
“What are they going to do with me?” I asked.
“If Ethan had his way, you’d never leave his side. Caleb doesn’t really trust you, but he has the hots for your mom and isn’t willing to hurt her.”
I scowled. “How fucking sensitive of him.”
She laughed. “So, what do you want to do?” she asked. “Do you care for Ethan?”
“I don’t know,” I said, pulling the T-shirt over my head, “he stares into my eyes and I want nothing more than to be with him. But that’s not real, is it? Isn’t that some kind of power he has to control people?”
She nodded. “True.”
“But, even now…” I said. “He has this effect on me and he’s not even in the room. I guess I really might feel something for him. It’s all so confusing.”
“It’s only natural to feel lust towards him, if that’s all it is. He’s very sexy.”
“That is no lie.” 
“Caleb said he caught you with some guy named Duncan,” she said. 
“Yeah,” I answered. “I’ve kind of been seeing Duncan.”
“Are you in love with this, Duncan?”
“I think I’m confused. I don’t know. Maybe I’m a little in love with both of them.”
She smiled. “Being in love with one of us is dangerous. If you decide to stay with Ethan, you can’t live a normal life.”
I swallowed. “So, are you vampires?”
She grimaced. “I never did like that word.”
I swallowed. “So… do you suck people’s blood?”
She stepped closer to me and touched my cheek as I held my breath. “We take nourishment wherever we can get it. Some are willing to give us our nourishment, some don’t have much say in the matter.”
I backed up. “So, you are willing to kill people if you have to?”
She smiled darkly. “Survival of the fittest.”
“Is Caleb turning my mother into one of you?”  
“I believe that he has chosen your mother to be his mate.”
Oh, hell.
“Is Caleb your real father?” I asked, continuing with my questions. If she was willing to answer, I wasn’t going to stop.
“Yes,” she said. “My father became a… vampire first. He then turned me into one to save my life.”
My eyebrows shot up. “What do you mean?” 
 “I had Typhoid.”
“Wow, when was that?”
“Eighteen ninety-one,” she said.
I stared at her in shock. “That would make you…”
“Much older than you,” she answered. 
Caleb stormed into the bedroom and waved at me. “Let’s go. We have to get you out of here before your brother and Duncan show up. I guess they know about this place from Susan.”
“Are you taking me home?” I asked, backing away from him.
His eyes narrowed. “You weren’t hurt, and when I walked in on you and Ethan, you looked to be enjoying yourself. You aren’t planning on pressing any charges against Ethan, are you?”
I looked past Caleb to where Ethan was standing with his arms crossed, looking furious. “No,” I said.
“You aren’t going to make any trouble for us, are you? Not that anyone would believe you anyway,” said Caleb.
“If you leave my mother alone,” I said. “I’ll keep my mouth shut.”
Caleb’s face turned dark. “I can’t do that.”
“Yes you can! Do you think I want my mom turning into a vampire? I’ve seen her neck!” I yelled, surprising myself.
He sighed. “There are things you don’t understand. Your mother… I have feelings for her and I’d do anything for her.”
“So you’d turn her into one of you?”
He ran a hand through his hair. “How do I say this?” he stepped closer. “Your mother has cancer and I’m giving her a second chance.”
I snorted. “You seriously expect me to believe that?”
“She has breast cancer,” he said, his face grim. “Hell, she doesn’t even know about it yet.”
I felt sick to my stomach. “What, you can sense that?”
He nodded. “Yes and if she becomes one of us, she’ll survive. If she doesn’t, she may die.”
“But you didn’t even consider giving her a chance?”
“I was afraid she’d say no,” he said. “You’re right, though, I didn’t give her a choice. She may hate me when she finds out, but at least she’ll be alive.”
“Do you consider yourself alive?”  
Ethan stepped past Caleb and put his hands on my shoulders. “Do I look dead to you? What you felt earlier, was that really so bad?”
I stepped back. “Ethan, you’re trying to control me again. I don’t know how I feel about you because it isn’t real. You use your powers to make me feel things that I’m not even sure about.”
“I only did it the first night we met,” he said. “And I’m…. sorry. But I haven’t manipulated you at all since that night. Every feeling, every emotion you’ve had since then, has been real.”
There was a sharp knock at the door and someone stepped into the room. “We have to do something, now!” hollered one of the guys I’d seen Ethan with in the diner the other night. “Someone’s here. I think it’s her damn brother.”
“Fuck,” groaned Caleb. 
“Wait,” said Celeste. “Let me take care of him.”
“Don’t you dare hurt my brother,” I snapped.
She smiled. “Believe me, when I’m done with him, he’ll be begging me to hurt him. But in a good way.”
I wasn’t sure what she meant, but Caleb nodded and said, “Celeste won’t hurt him or she’ll answer to me.”
She gave him a pouty face as she stepped out of the room.
Caleb nodded towards the door. “You’re free to leave,” he said to me.
I looked at Ethan, who was obviously upset. “I…”
“I told you before that you were free to go,” he said. “I’d never do anything to hurt you.”
I’m sure he still thought I was Miranda and wanted me to become a vampire like he was. But the very idea of doing that was frightening beyond belief. I still wasn’t exactly sure how I felt about him, but I knew without a doubt that I didn’t belong to that world.
I looked down and stepped past him to the door. 
“Nikki.”
I turned to him. “What, Ethan?”
“You haven’t seen the last of me.”
I wish I could have pretended that those words didn’t affect me, but they did. He must have noticed my reaction, because he licked his lips and gave me a slow sexy smile.   
“Goodbye, Ethan,” I said, walking away.

Chapter Twenty-Five


They lived in a large old colonial that was very well furnished. I’m not sure why I was so surprised; if they were vampires and could live for centuries, they had time to save for such luxuries.
“Nikki!” hollered my brother from the front door. “Are you okay?”
I was walking down a long spiral staircase that faced the front door where Nathan and Duncan stood. They were being held back by two other guys from the diner, who I assumed were also vampires. Celeste was also with them.
“I’m fine,” I said.
Duncan looked pissed and was glaring at the vampires. “Get out of our way so we can make sure she’s not hurt!”
“Now, now,” said Celeste. “She’s doing fine. She came here on her own free will, and isn’t hurt in the least.”
“Who are you?” asked Duncan.
She smiled. “I’m a friend of Nikki’s and Anne’s. I’m Caleb’s daughter, Celeste.”
“She’s fine,” confirmed Caleb, trying to ease the tension in the room. “And she’s not pressing charges because she came on her own free will.”
I walked to the front door and Duncan put his arms around me. “Are you okay?” he asked, searching my face.
“Yeah, I’m fine.”
Duncan frowned and looked at Caleb. “I should press charges against that asshole, Ethan, wherever he is.”
“I’m right here,” said Ethan, coming down from the top of the stairs.    
“Okay, do you want to press charges?” asked Caleb.
Duncan glared at Ethan, who was smiling malevolently. “I just want him to leave Nikki alone,” he said.
“Nikki and I are friends,” replied Ethan, his eyes undressing me again. Even now I wanted to be underneath him, his mouth and hands everywhere. Especially when he looked at me that way – like I was his possession and he knew it. 
“Right,” snapped Duncan.
“I remember you now,” said Celeste to Nathan. “You’re the cute guy from the grocery store the other night.” 
Nathan’s eyes appeared to dilate as he stared at the beautiful vampire. A lopsided grin spread across his face. “I was wondering what happened to you. It’s nice to see you again.”
“And it’s very nice to see you,” she replied, twirling a red curl around her finger.
Duncan frowned.  “Nathan, she’s with them. Don’t fall for this shit.”
Nathan ignored him, staring at her as if she was a buffet of food and he was dying of starvation. “So, Celeste, what are you doing with these jackasses?”  
“I rode over here with my dad,” she answered. “I’m friends with Ethan and wanted to find out what was happening.” She looked at Duncan and smiled. “You must be Duncan?”
Duncan sighed. “Yeah.”
“I’ve heard all about you,” she said, putting her hands on her hips. “Nikki’s quite fond of you.”
He looked at me and I smiled.
Celeste yawned. “Guys, I’m getting really tired and I think everyone should go home now, it’s very late. Isn’t that right, Duncan?”
Duncan’s eyes dilated as their eyes met. “Yes, it’s getting late. We should all go home.”
“Good thinking,” she said with an amused expression. She turned to Caleb who looked satisfied at the change of events. “Daddy, I’m starving. Can we stop somewhere for a late snack on the way home?”
From the look in her eyes, I knew her snack wasn’t the type I’d enjoy. I quickly grabbed Duncan’s and Nathan’s hands. “We have to leave. Now.”
“Goodbye, Nikki,” called Ethan. “I’m sure I’ll be seeing you very soon.”
Duncan somehow snapped out of his trance. He stared at Ethan with hate. “Stay the fuck away from her!”
“Only if she wants me to,” he replied, his eyes still focused on me. 
That had nothing to do with what I wanted from him. In fact, I knew that if we didn’t get out of the house soon, I’d never be able to leave. “Let’s go,” I said, pulling them through the door. 
When we got into Nathan’s Mustang, his mind seemed to clear from whatever spell Celeste had put him under. “What in the hell just happened?”
“I don’t know,” said Duncan, who was sitting in the backseat, tapping his fingers nervously on the door. “What I do know is that I should have had Ethan arrested for trying to kill me earlier.”
“Are you sure you’re okay, Nikki?” asked my brother. “You weren’t bitten or anything, were you?”
I shook my head.
“So, is Ethan a vampire or what?” asked Duncan. “He certainly has some kind of super strength. He almost killed me on the beach. Then he took off with my girl. I feel like such a lame excuse for a boyfriend. ”
I turned around to look at him. “There’s no way you could have done anything more. And look, I’m here, now, and I’m totally fine.”
He sighed. “It’s my fault, you know. You warned me about walking on the beach. I’m just glad you’re okay. I was so worried that he might have killed you or something.”
“No, he wouldn’t kill me.”
“How can you be so sure? You can’t trust that maniac. Look what happened to Abigail.”
“We don’t know if he did that,” I said, not wanting to believe it. I couldn’t imagine Ethan as a murderer. Not when he made me feel so safe and alive.
“Did you actually ask him?” asked Nathan.
“Um, no. Are you kidding?”
He frowned. “What about those other girls. Did you ask him about those?”
“No.”
The truth was, I was terrified of his answer.
“So, what were you doing all this time?” asked Duncan.  
I lied. “Just talked about other things.”  I certainly couldn’t tell him the truth. It did neither of us any good, and until I figured out what had actually happened and whether or not I’d had any control, I’d keep it to myself. Besides, hurting Duncan was the last thing I wanted to do. “To tell you the truth, I talked to Celeste more than anyone.”
“She is so freaken hot,” said Nathan, grinning. “I’m going to have to get her number from Caleb.”
“No, Nathan. Just stay away from her,” I said.
“Why?” asked Nathan. “Because you don’t like Caleb?” 
I sighed. “No, because she’s a vampire. So is he, by the way.”
Nathan slammed on the brakes. “What?”
Before I could continue, something landed on the top of Nathan’s car with a loud thud.
“Shit!” hollered Duncan as Ethan jumped to the ground. “He’s come back for Nikki.”
The doors were locked but it didn’t stop him. He ripped mine open and tossed it into the ditch.
“Shit, no… he didn’t just do that to my Mustang!” hollered Nathan, getting out of the car.
“Hi,” smiled Ethan, as he bent down on one knee. He held out his hand to me. “I just couldn’t stay away. Do you have a few minutes to talk in private?”
“No,” I said, backing away. “I can’t go anywhere with you.”
He actually looked hurt. He stood up. “Why?”
“Leave her alone, you bastard!” snarled Duncan, getting out of the car. He walked around and stood next to Nathan, his fists clenched, ready to fight. 
“I think we can take him together, bro,” said Nathan, taking a step towards Ethan. 
Ethan smiled with a hint of fang. “I won’t hurt you because Nikki wants it that way. But if either of you touch me, your future holds no promises.”
“Okay, fine, what do you want with me?” I asked, getting out of the car. I didn’t want anyone hurt but from the look on everyone’s faces, something was about to go down. Unfortunately, there was no doubt in my mind that it would be Duncan and Nathan.
Ethan sighed and ran a hand through his black hair, which was still messy from rolling around in bed with me. “I’m leaving. Caleb has banished me and I’m going to New York.”
“Good,” replied Duncan. “Then you’d better move quickly, daylight’s coming.”
He smiled coldly. “Daylight doesn’t affect me. It’s just a little… uncomfortable.”
“My sister isn’t going anywhere with you,” said Nathan. “And guess what? You’re going to pay for my door before you leave.”
Ethan took out his wallet and threw several hundred dollar bills at his feet. “There you go, bro. Get it fixed.”
“Asshole,” mumbled Nathan, picking up the bills.
Ethan turned back to me. “Can we just have a little time alone, Nikki? There are some things I need to tell you.”
Duncan moved in front of me. “You stay the fuck away from her.” 
“This doesn’t concern you,” replied Ethan, glaring at Duncan. “Move aside.” 
“You’re going to have to make me,” he growled.
I groaned and stepped around him. “Fine, I’ll talk to you, Ethan.” If he actually was leaving, I wanted to find out what he had to say. 
“Bullshit,” said Nathan. “No way is that going to happen.”
I turned to my brother and grabbed his arm, pulling him away. “Nathan,” I whispered. “Just, let me talk to him. He hasn’t hurt me. Not ever. Give us a few minutes alone, within eyesight of you two. Maybe he’ll give us information on those murders. I seriously don’t think he did it but maybe he knows who did.”
“No! He might sweep you away like he did last time,” said Nathan. “Besides, what do you have to say to this… monster?”
I stared into his eyes. “Nathan, nothing is going to happen, okay? Just, trust me. We won’t go far, and if I need your help, I’ll call you guys. Please?”
“What’s going on?” asked Duncan, moving closer to us.
He rubbed his forehead. “She really wants to talk to Ethan.”
Duncan’s eyes widened in alarm. “Why?”
“To see if he knows anything about those murders. Trust me, he won’t hurt me.”
“It’s him I don’t trust,” grunted Duncan.
“I could have taken her already,” volunteered Ethan loudly. Obviously, his ears were picking up on our conversation. “But I haven’t and won’t, if that’s her decision.” 
“What about the mind control thing? He might talk you into it,” said Nathan.
I turned towards Ethan. “You won’t use that. Right, Ethan?” I asked, raising my voice, although I didn’t know what the point was.
“Of course not.”
“I still don’t like it,” said Duncan, advancing towards Ethan. “She’s my girl, asshole. Why can’t you leave her alone?”
Ethan ignored him. He held his hand out to me as I chased after Duncan, to stop him. “Nikki? Can we just have a few moments alone? Seriously, I don’t have much time.”
“Yes,” I replied, ignoring his hand. I knew my brother and Duncan were still angry, but I wanted to hear what Ethan had to say.
“Don’t worry, I’ll take good care of her,” said Ethan right before he grabbed my hand and flew away.
 

Chapter Twenty-Six


“Ethan!”  I shouted as soon as we landed. I stepped away and pointed at him angrily. “What the hell? You weren’t supposed to actually fly off with me like that!”
“I wanted to be alone with you. It might be our last time,” he pouted.
I sighed. “That wasn’t supposed to be part of the deal.”
“Sorry.”
“So, what is this about?”
He smiled. “I wanted you to come with me. To New York.”
My eyes widened. “I’m still in school and you’re a… vampire. I can’t just go away with you.”
He got down on his knees and stared up at me. “Would it help if I confessed my undead love for you?”
This time I laughed out loud. “You’re crazy.”
He stood up and pulled me back into his arms. “Hey, the only thing I’m crazy about, is you.”
“I’m not so sure about that. I mean, you keep calling me Miranda. I’m not this person and I’ll never be her.”
He tipped my chin up and stared into my eyes. “I know that. Look, Nikki, I’m drawn to you, and as far as I’m concerned, nothing else matters.”
“Drawn to me?”
“Yes. There’s this magnetic pull between us, can’t you feel it? It’s like, we were meant to be together.”  
“I don’t know about a magnetic pull… I mean, I like you. I like you, a lot. But…”
“But what? Just throw caution to the wind. I’ll take care of you, Nikki. I swear I’ll keep you safe.”
“I just can’t do what you’re asking. My mother needs me so much right now, and I can’t leave my brother. You have to understand that? You and I… we don’t even really know each other.”
“I won’t force you to come with me, but I want you to understand that I can’t come back to this place.”
I stared at his face, which was so incredibly handsome. I knew I’d miss him. Whether it was real or not, I felt something for Ethan and wished things were different. 
He bent forward and pressed his lips to mine.  
“Your skin, it’s so cool,” I whispered, touching his cheek.
 “I haven’t had time to… feed.  I had other things on my mind.”
I touched his forehead. “When your skin is cooler, does it mean you’re weaker?”
“Yes, In fact, I’ll lose most of my strength if I don’t eat soon. That’s another reason I wanted to move quickly.”
“So, what exactly do you need to… survive?”
He smiled bitterly. “Do you really want to know?”
“Not really, but I need to know one thing; do you kill innocent people?”
He shook his head vehemently. “No. I feed off of willing victims. I only take what I need and they live to see another day. Swear to God.”
I stared at him. I wasn’t sure where he found ‘willing victims’ and wasn’t about to ask.  
I sighed. “Where are you going to find a willing victim now?”
 “I don’t know yet,” he smiled grimly. “I guess I hadn’t thought about that when I was chasing after you. I just really wanted to see you before I left.”
“How about me?”
His eyes widened. “You?”
I pulled my hair away from my neck. “Yes, use my blood. Do it before I change my mind, though.”
He stared at my neck and licked his lips. “I… there is some danger involved. If anything happened to you, I’d never forgive myself.”
“Then you’d better do it quickly, before I chicken out. I hate needles enough as it is.”
He lips curled up. “It’s not quite the same thing.”
I swallowed. “Okay, does it hurt?”
He caressed my neck with his fingertip and I shivered. “I can make it enjoyable for you,” he whispered, huskily.
I looked up into his blue eyes and the naked desire reflected there made me breathless. “Okay,” I whispered. “Just do it, quickly.”
“You sure?”
“Yes. Take my blood.”
His eyes dilated. With a low growl in the back of his throat, his lips crushed mine and his tongue made its way into my mouth, stroking and demanding a response. 
And respond I did.
I slid my hands around his neck, drawing him closer and I could feel his arousal pressing against me. I shivered in delight as a desire to wrap my legs around his waist and hold on forever washed over me.
Instead, he let me go.   
“Are you sure about this?” he asked. He was breathing so heavily, it reminded me of a lion panting for water.
I touched his lip with the pad of my thumb. It was so sensual and yet, something lurked behind it that both frightened and excited me. “Yes, just do it already.”
Ethan stared into my eyes and a burning desire to do whatever he wanted, slammed through every nerve in my body. This time I grabbed the back of his head and pulled him down to meet my lips, feeling like I just couldn’t get enough of his mouth. 
He groaned against my lips and cupped my rear, rubbing his hips against mine, causing a warm ache between my legs. Just when I didn’t think I could take it anymore, he raised his head.
“Please,” I begged, not even sure of what I was asking for anymore.
He moved his mouth to my neck and paused. I could feel the coolness of his breath against my skin; I could also feel him trembling. “I love you,” he whispered and then, his teeth broke through.
I shuddered in ecstasy as my blood flowed into him with a rush of pleasure so great, that I could have died and it wouldn’t have mattered. “Ethan,” I breathed, clutching him tighter so that I wouldn’t fall. 
A gunshot echoed through the night and suddenly he was backing away from me, a look of horror and pain etched on his face. Before I could ask him what had happened, he was gone.
“Did you get him?!” shouted my mother’s voice in the darkness.
“Yeah,” said Caleb. “He’s bleeding. He won’t get far.”
My mother was crying hysterically as she rushed towards me. “Nikki! Oh, my God, you’re bleeding everywhere. We have to get her to the hospital!” she screamed at Caleb.
Caleb nodded. “I’ve already called an ambulance.”
“Mom,” I whispered, staring at her in confusion. How did she get there? Where was Ethan?
“Are you okay?” she asked.
 “Yeah… I’m… fine.”
She shook her head and sobbed harder. “No, you’re not! You’re bleeding and you’re so pale. Dear Lord, what was that monster doing to my little girl?!”
I couldn’t answer her, because at that moment, I lost consciousness.

Author Note


Thank you for taking the time to read the first installment of Night Roamers, which is always free. I really hope that you enjoyed it! If not, well it’s one of the reasons that I make it free. You can quit and not move on to the next book in the series. Everyone’s tastes are different and I respect that.

Being an Indie author comes with many challenges, and the biggest one is advertising, which can be very expensive without the help of a big publisher. Because of this, we rely greatly on reviews and word of mouth, so if you’ve enjoyed this or any of my other books, I would be very grateful if you could leave a small one.  It means so much to a writer and gives them incentive to write more.

Thanks again for taking the time to read this book. Your support means everything 

Unanswered Questions? 

There are some things that happened in Blur that I want to address, as many people have questioned the ‘instant’ romances that took place in the story. 
Normal?
 Eh, probably not. But that’s the beauty of writing fiction. Anything is possible. For example, the vampires in my story have a hypnotic (I use the term “Charm” in later books) quality about them. In other words, Nikki’s mother fell for Caleb quickly, because he’s a vampire. The Night Roamers have a special kind of… pheromone, I guess you could say. The same was the case for Nikki. When she met Ethan in the diner, the charming began and that’s why she became so enamored with him, and so fast. As far as Duncan goes… well that started out as an innocent crush, which happens all the time to teenaged girls. Would she have still jumped all over him in the truck if she hadn’t just been around Ethan? 
More than likely – No. 
She liked Duncan, but the pheromone or charm really messed with her hormones, thus, she just couldn’t help herself.
Anyway, I hope this cleared a couple of things up. Thanks again for reading and taking the chance on an Indie Author.
