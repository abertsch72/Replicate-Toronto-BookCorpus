Conservation 

Conservation has spent the past four decades leading humanity out among the stars. 
In 2034, the Universal Mining Agency launched a ship full of eager potential colonists. Conservation provides its passengers with everything they need as it sets off for their new home on a distant, habitable planet. 
As the decades go by, the optimism and hope that surrounded its launch dissipate, and certain members of agency staff begin to have their doubts about the project. Conservation was meant to be a microcosm of humanity, minus the cruelty and ill health. Society has degraded into a violent, fascist regime built on slavery and famine, but this time, things were supposed to be different. 
Zoologist David Kingston, who consulted on the original mission, becomes more and more anxious about the fate of the ship. A direct video call with a strange crew member does nothing to quell his worry. Instead, David realizes that there may be something evil aboard the huge vessel. 
Then, suddenly, everything goes dark. Conservation stops transmitting reports. As David investigates the mysteries of the famous ship, he will discover the horrifying truth about its journey.

Preface 
  
Whenever I look over the body of work that I've created so far, I always regard Swarm in a special light. The idea came to me after listening to a podcast one night about a phenomenon called swarm intelligence, and for five years after that it slowly matured over several edits like a fine wine. 
It differs from my other stories because my appreciation for human evolution and the subconscious mind has been able to show its face and flourish like never before, creating a tale which sits in its own realm in terms of its character. 
Like most of my other stories, however, it highlights the dark side of humanity rather than the bright side. This could mean that the human race is malignant and I'm observant enough to see it, or it could mean that I've simply got a sick mind and a love for all things macabre and catastrophic. 
I'll let you decide.

They brought the minds together into one 
The wires, the screens, the bleeping, and the hum 
A single unit, wisdom without bounds 
Its influence reached far and all around 
  
A pyramid, it was so grandiose 
From the earth, its humongous body rose 
At first the structure was a force for good 
Until it grew, then sour went the mood 
  
The folk were fighting, shouting night and day 
The beast rose up, and flew into a rage 
The town of Drachton raged from dusk till dawn 
Behold the power of the mighty Swarm! 
 
  
 
 
  
Phone Call
 
  
A chorus of sirens echoed through the dusty streets, as several police cars raced towards the scene of another down town burglary. The cars sped past a cluster of high-rise apartment blocks that lined the main road, and high up in one of these buildings a silhouette was visible, set against a yellow light shining out from a window. A solitary man peered down towards the noise and chaos from his empty flat, his face still and expressionless against the glass. He was perched up against the window sill, unable to sleep through the racket, lost in a melancholy daze as the fighting and looting ravaged the neighbourhood for yet another night. The town of Drachton was coming apart at the seams, and the only things holding it together were the police units and riot patrols who incessantly sped through the blocks and alleyways in pursuit of the criminals. 
Drachton's problems were so severe that the local authorities were now hiring a private security company to assist the police in keeping law and order. GLC—a vast, renowned security organisation—had been given the job of assisting the local constabulary whenever things got out of hand, as well as running and managing the town's prisons and correctional facilities. GLC were the real deal with many years of experience and financial backing, but Drachton was proving to be a tough gig even for them, and so the war continued to rage on night and day like a wild bush fire. 
  
With the squad cars now out of sight and the wailing tones of the sirens fading off into the distance, the man peeled himself away from the window to go and make a drink. Eric Trammel had lived alone for five years now. His wife was killed a few streets away one evening after walking into a convenience store on the way home from work. The place was being held up by a group of small-time gangsters as she walked in, a bunch of petty thugs who didn't know their ass from their elbow, and she caught a bullet in the head for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
Eric had never truly recovered from the ordeal. 
Appalled by the rising gang culture in his town and angered by the loss of his wife, Trammel had eventually joined GLC shortly after their arrival. As a junior member of staff he had very little power or authority, but nevertheless, his mission in life now was to do anything he could to make a difference. He may have been a small potato, but he was simply glad to be a part of the organized resistance, an extra pair of hands within the team of personnel fighting hard to get the town back in order. 
Just as he was entering the kitchen to make a beverage a buzzing sound rose up from somewhere behind him. He turned, startled, feeling only mildly relieved when he saw that the noise was coming from his phone vibrating on the living room coffee table. It cut off before he could get to it, but the caller left a voice message: 
  
Eric, it's Clyde. Sorry to call you at this hour, but there's going to be a meeting tomorrow morning at 09.00am in the main conference hall. An extremely important announcement is being made, and you're required to be there. 
Don't be late. 
  
Clyde McQuade; love him or hate him. Clyde was Eric's senior manager at GLC. As a stout, authoritarian, balding man in his mid-fifties, he took shit from no one. He'd worked the wings of a few correctional facilities back in the day, but now he was more into barking orders at people from the other side of a wooden desk. His bark was usually worse than his bite, but still, if he was calling you outside of work hours it was clear that something mega was going down. 
Placing the phone back down on the table, Eric stood there in the silence of his flat for a moment, wondering what this mystery announcement could've been about. 
He would find out in due course. 
 
  
 
 
  
The Conference
 
  
The conference hall was full to the brim with GLC staff. Dozens of seats were aligned in neat rows, and the stage around the lectern had been swept and polished to a presentable state. A pull-down projector screen hung on the rear wall behind the stage floor, and the entire presentation platform was framed with a set of red velvet curtains tied up with string. 
The atmosphere was one of charged curiosity, and as Trammel sat next to some of his fellow employees it felt as though everyone knew that something revolutionary was about to happen, although nobody quite knew what it was. Workers from various departments of the company, people who rarely laid eyes on each other during the course of an average day, were now brushing shoulders and chatting, pulled away from their comfortable desks to await the arrival of their senior manager, Clyde McQuade. 
  
Trammel was sat in the third row, perched between two executives from his floor within the headquarters building. Feeling a little nervous and self-conscious from being in close proximity to so many managers and upper-level staff, he was relieved when McQuade finally came walking up to the podium, as well as genuinely eager to hear what he had to say. 
Years of sitting behind desks and pushing pencils had left McQuade with a podgy look, and there was a waddle to his gait as he made his way up to the microphone. Nevertheless, he still had a strong presence about him, and as soon as he started talking his voice cancelled out all others, causing the noise among the seats to fizzle out and vanish. 
`I'm sure you're all wondering why you've been asked to come down here to the conference hall this morning,' he started. `Well, don't look too worried, nobody's in trouble. In fact, I'm pleased to be able to say that we have some good news.' 
McQuade grinned, noticing the lines of workers relaxing. 
`As you're all well aware, over recent years it has become increasingly difficult for us to assist the authorities in combating crime in Drachton. In five years alone, gang-related murders have risen by twenty percent, and petty crime continues to occur in a blatant, casual manner. GLC's approach to this problem so far has been to increase the number of riot patrols and armoured vehicles in the districts, fighting violence with violence, and fire with fire. And although this approach may work in the short-term, the evidence shows us that it isn't a long-term solution to the problem. If Drachton is to have any kind of future at all a long-term plan is needed, a plan that can end the cycle of crime and punishment that proliferates as each year goes by.' 
McQuade looked up from his notes, projecting a stern glare to all those seated before him. 
`Our prisons are at bursting point and massively overcrowded, with honest taxpayers fronting the bill. A new system is required, ladies and gentlemen, a new system that can solve this mass epidemic of criminal behaviour. For the first time in history the prison population exceeds the civilian population. The few are now paying for, and funding, the many. If this current trend continues the prisons will fall apart at the seams, financially and physically.' 
McQuade was now in full flow, speaking in bold tones of rhetoric. 
`The survival of GLC as a company rests on our continued contracts with the council, and we have to prove our efficiency daily. And it is for this reason, ladies and gentlemen, that our research department works around the clock to try and come up with new, revolutionary approaches to the problems we face. And today, I'm very pleased to be able to announce that we have indeed developed a unique approach, an approach that could potentially restore Drachton back to what it once was: a clean, functional, and prospering town. But I am not the man to present this idea to you, for you should hear it straight from the person who devised it, and that is, of course, Professor Simon Mellish.' 
Trammel, like everyone else, sat in captivated silence. His interest was well and truly piqued, and an anticipation swelled through him of the kind he hadn't felt in quite some time, his mind swimming with thoughts and guesses as to what this so called unique approach might be. 
Professor Mellish—a man who Eric had encountered only once or twice during his time at GLC—appeared from the left-hand-side of the room. He was a man of slim build, and he wore a smart-casual outfit instead of his usual white overcoat and shoes. His clean face displayed an eagerness to tell everyone what he had to say, and after a brief introduction he got right to it. 
`Before I present you with my radical new plans, it's important that you already understand the theory behind them. So, to that end, I'll begin by introducing you to a phenomenon commonly known as swarm intelligence.' 
Mellish took a moment to breath and compose himself, taking his time in his approach. Everyone seemed to be unfamiliar with the terminology that he'd just used, and confused sounds rattled through the hall. 
`Let me explain. Evolution has produced two different kinds of intelligence here on earth. Firstly, there is singular intelligence. This is the kind that we possess, where a single entity has the ability to think for itself and make important, complex decisions in its own head using its own brain. Singular intelligence is the kind that we all know and use every day, as do all other mammals.' 
The professor was confronted with a wall of empty stares from the aisles, but he persevered. 
`The other type is called swarm intelligence. Swarm intelligence is an alternative method that nature has produced, enabling large numbers of animals to work together to solve problems that no single member of the species would be capable of solving on their own.' 
The professor let this sink in for a moment before continuing. 
`Swarm intelligence is the system that helps bees and ants choose the best place to build a nest when faced with a number of different options, despite each single insect being incapable of making the decision on their own. Swarm intelligence is what enables flocks of birds to bob and weave through the sky as one all-knowing, all-seeing unit, without one single bird being in charge. Swarm intelligence is what allows schools of fish to swim through the sea in one giant mass, moving and thinking as if it were a single marine animal, every fish a part of a greater entity. This is nature's second method of intelligence, a way for unintelligent creatures to make intelligent decisions by combining themselves as one. But I ask you: what could be achieved if intelligent creatures like Homo sapiens were to join up and become one single unit? What could be achieved if one giant hive mind was created, using organisms that already possess their own individual processing power? Right now, as I speak, we have thousands and thousands of prisoners in our jails, festering in cells and wasting away their days, as well as taxpayers' money. This is a huge waste of untapped potential. As Clyde just mentioned, every taxpayer in the land pays for our prisons, every honest citizen funds these stagnating jails where inmates are housed, fed, and provided with amenities, only to sit around all day and then re-offend once released.' 
Mellish's voice rose a few decibels. 
`The system is broken, people, and it can't continue. We have got able bodies and minds going to waste because they are unwilling to work, but what if we could harness their collective brain power? What if we could put our prison population to good use, wiring up every inmate's brain to an artificial hive brain? What if we could create our own version of swarm intelligence?' 
After letting everyone ponder these words for a moment, he continued. 
`Well, with the help of my dedicated colleagues over in the research laboratories, I have devised a way to do such a thing.' 
Pressing a button behind the lectern Mellish lit up the huge projection screen, displaying an architectural drawing of a pyramid-shaped building. 
`It is with great pleasure that I introduce to you: Swarm.' 
The quiet rows of seats became animated as everyone studied the striking picture in front of them, and as the professor described the various features of this unique-looking construction project the buzz of excitement grew more and more. Staring up at this diamond-shaped blueprint, with Mellish's technical descriptions of the mainframe computer and the many wings that formed it, the morale of the GLC staff was instantly lifted. People could now see the profound vision that the professor had in mind. It was clear that this wasn't just another half-hearted proposal, this was revolutionary, an idea that would completely transform Drachton as well as the actual prison system itself. 
`The next step for us is to win the approval of the authorities, and then GLC can start to make some serious changes, reversing the disease and decay that has rotted this town for way too long. But what, I hear you ask, will be the point in such a venture? What will we be able to achieve with a giant, collective hive mind? Well, the real question, people, is what won't we be able to achieve? I predict that by harnessing the collective intelligence of thousands of humans this town will be able to prosper financially, and on a wider scale we may even be able to solve some of the bigger problems that have eluded mankind for centuries. Imagine never making a bad decision ever again, imagine living in a town where investments never fail, imagine if doctors and scientists were able to produce cures for all known diseases and ailments with the help of a higher consciousness close at hand.' 
Now that the initial shock and thrill of the proposal had subsided, the inevitable cynicism and doubt started to rise from the pews. Mellish noticed this change of mood, and so continued to espouse the positive elements of his project. 
`If this works, people, it will not only clean up our failing society, but it will propel GLC to dizzying new heights. You could be working for the company of the future, a company that is on the cusp of achieving global stardom.' 
  
As Trammel took all of this in, sat there with his face child-like and full of wonder, he had the sudden sensation of being in a dream. The idea was so far-fetched that he couldn't quite believe it, it was almost like listening to a mad professor with a plan to take over the world. But it was real and it was happening, and he wondered whether he really was on the brink of witnessing real change. 
By the time the announcement was over he was open to the possibility that this insane plan might actually work. The ethics of such an operation were questionable, but he held such a contempt for the criminal activity in his town that he was willing to overlook these ethical problems for the sake of the greater good, as was everyone else. 
For the first time in years Eric Trammel felt something warm bubble up inside of him, a kind of forgotten hope that'd been reawakened by this radical new idea. Surrounded by his awestruck work colleagues, with the image of this outrageous architectural building burned into his eyes, he realised that his dream of seeing Drachton clean and safe again might actually happen.
Cattle to an Abattoir
 
  
Perhaps unsurprisingly the authorities were keen on giving GLC the go ahead, and so the construction of Swarm was soon underway. It was an operation unlike anything Eric had ever seen before. Consisting of glass, steel and concrete, Swarm resembled a kind of modern-day Egyptian pyramid. Built on a vast patch of unoccupied grassland down in the southern District, the numerous tiers and levels of the structure rose four hundred feet up into the sky, with each subsequent floor reducing in width towards the pointy tip that pierced the clouds. The lower floors of the building were to house the influx of inmates yet to be transferred to the facility, and the top floor, the lofty summit of the structure, would serve as a processing hub, or so he was told. 
  
Without being a high enough rank within the company to be granted an early entry into the gigantic structure, Eric was restricted for the time being to viewing Swarm from the outside, monitoring its progress from a distance until its grand, official opening. One thing he did witness close up, however, was the emptying of the prisons, and it was a horrendous, ugly affair. Large teams of GLC riot officers worked their way through the many correctional facilities cell by cell, dragging furious inmates kicking and screaming down corridors and out into waiting transportation vehicles. Rumours of this revolutionary new program had been in circulation among the prison population beforehand, and fear and anxiety had been running high for some time. Some prisoners went peacefully, allowing themselves to be cuffed and escorted away by the intimidating GLC riot personnel, but most were reluctant to leave the cosy familiarity of their current surroundings, forcing the riot officers to use their batons and pepper spray before carrying them away. 
Eric's role within this particular part of the operation was of an administrative nature, but he'd been close enough to the action to taste the fear and loathing in the air within the prisons, and the sight of the bedraggled inmates being pushed and carried past him along the narrow landings and wings of the old jails had reminded him of cattle being taken to an abattoir, with the transportation vehicles out on the street serving as the human cattle trucks. He couldn't blame the inmates for being fearful of this new plan, and he felt a certain degree of sympathy for them as they brushed past him, cuffed and dazed, but with the memory of his deceased wife weighing down on his heart and the town's crime and chaos grinding away at him on a daily basis, he was able to maintain a stern attitude and accept these disturbing sights as an unfortunate step that just had to be taken. 
 
  
 
  
New Assignment
 
  
After the entire process was completed, and the wings of the newly-built Swarm facility were filled, Trammel was called into McQuade's office for a personal briefing. Being called in to see McQuade directly usually meant bad news, but this time he sensed that things might be a little different. 
`I'm putting you in charge of weekly inspections, Trammel,' said McQuade, sitting across the desk like a bull, his thick shoulders covering the top half of his chair. 
`You mean at Swarm?' replied Eric, hesitantly. 
`No, I mean at the local OAP's knitting club,' sighed McQuade. `Yes, of course I mean at Swarm.' 
`Sorry, I just wasn't sure whether you were referring to one of my other patrols.' 
`Don't worry about your other patrols. I'm re-delegating them while you monitor Swarm for teething problems. You've been here long enough now to be trusted with the extra responsibility.' 
Eric didn't argue or protest about his new assignment. If the truth be told, he was quite keen to get his teeth into this insane new project, so as he listened to his manager brief him up on his new duties, reeling off the various jobs that were expected of him, he was smiling inside and struggling to contain his excitement. 
A folder was thrown over the desk towards him containing inspection sheets and contact lists that he would need whilst working at the new facility, and then the meeting came to an abrupt end. Eric rose to his feet, folder in hand, then nodded to McQuade respectfully as he left the room. Walking out through the corridor, he was tingling with excitement at the prospect of seeing the interior of the Swarm complex up close. 
 
  
 
  
Colourful Shapes and Digital Snakes
 
  
With the scaffolding and industrial machinery gone, Swarm shone like a polished stone upon the wispy field in which it stood. Driving into the site, Eric marvelled at the aesthetically pleasing array of shiny window panes and symmetrical architecture, struggling to keep his eyes on the access road as the mirrored surfaces reflected the deep-blue sky overhead. 
The entire site was huge. A tall, barbed-wire fence encircled the glass pyramid in a wide arc, with the one single entry point into the grounds being a manned security post facing the north side of the building. A team of security personnel stood guard at this fortified barrier, checking every car and driver that approached before allowing them entry. Eric noticed that a series of floodlights had been bolted to the fence at regular intervals, and he wondered what the facility looked like at night. Gazing up at the behemoth mass of pointed edges and chromatic glass, his imagination threw up images of a glowing piece of shrapnel clawing its way up out of the earth, or some kind of futuristic gladiatorial arena sent back in time. 
Outside the grounds, beyond the edge of the circular fence, acres of muddy grassland stretched off in each direction, with just a single tarmac lane snaking away towards down town Drachton. After driving up this lane and slowing the car down to a crawl, Eric stopped at the manned security barrier and flashed his GLC ID card towards one of the armed guards. After being given the all-clear he accelerated through the open barrier towards the towering walls of rising glass, feeling like an explorer approaching a strange, alien building on a faraway planet. 
  
He was scheduled to meet a warden named Brian Greller, a senior member of security staff who's job it was to show him around. As soon as Eric laid eyes on Mr Greller he saw him for exactly what he was: a hardy, no nonsense, old-school screw. Or, to be slightly more precise: a hardy, no nonsense, old-school screw who looked uncomfortable and wary of the strange new facility that he found himself in. He kind of resembled McQuade in some ways, albeit a less intellectual version of him. 
Greller marched across the reception area towards Eric, his polished boots and neatly-trimmed moustache giving him the superficial appearance of a drill sergeant fresh out of a military boot camp. He even made a point of looking at his watch before shaking Eric's hand, highlighting the fact that he was two minutes late. 
`You must be Trammel,' he grunted. 
`Pleased to meet you, sir,' Eric replied, feeling the bones in his hand split under the grip of an overly-firm handshake. 
`Here's your visitor pass,' he said, passing over a white card with a magnetic strip on the back. `We'll start with the bottom floor and work our way upwards.' 
He followed the warden to a set of security doors, then swiped his card after him to gain access. Walking through these doors, Eric was faced with the interior of Swarm for the very first time. A gleaming white corridor stretched off into the distance like a pearly tunnel, with open doorways on either side carved out at regular intervals. Faint beeping noises echoed up and down the immaculate walls, accompanied by swift footsteps as nurses trotted about in the midst of their chores. 
`This here is A wing,' grumbled Greller. `A wing takes up the whole entire ground floor. It's the biggest wing in the whole building.' 
This made sense to Trammel. The base of the building was wider than the top, so presumably the upper wings got progressively smaller. 
`I'm sure you're familiar with the general set-up. Each one of the prisoners is bed-bound and hooked up to a life support machine.' 
Greller spoke indignantly about everything that he was describing, a disapproving tone saturating every word that passed through his gritted teeth. Watching him walk and move around the corridor, he appeared to Eric like a disgruntled animal that'd been taken away from its familiar environment and thrown into a sterilised zoo that it didn't belong in, almost like the inmates he was in charge of keeping an eye on. For a split second Eric felt a wave of sympathy for him, but quickly shrugged it off when he realised that he was about to enter the first cell. 
The open doorway was right in front of him, and his heart was pounding with anxiety as he gingerly approached it. Hearing the mechanical sounds of the life-support machine inside he suddenly wanted to turn away and leave, but at the same time he didn't want to reveal his fear to Greller, so he put on a brave face and walked in. 
The room was small and windowless, but it was just as bright as the corridor outside. Strong lights beamed down from the ceiling onto the white walls and linoleum floor, and the inmate's bed was positioned over by the far wall. All the beefed-up security seemed pointless and unnecessary as Eric looked down at the motionless body before him. He felt as though he was visiting a dying relative who'd been involved in some near-fatal car collision, rather than a detained prisoner. It took several minutes for him to recover from the initial shock of what he was seeing, and then, and only then, was he able to move closer to the bed. 
A set of thin white sheets covered the man's legs and torso, with wires and tubes running out from under the sides in an arrangement one would expect to see in an intensive care unit at a state hospital. This arrangement was slightly different, however, because the man's ankles and wrists were buckled and strapped down to the steel bed frame. This detail made Eric's spine tingle with a fear he could not quite describe—and then it grew worse when he saw the man's head. His hair had been completely shaven off and a dozen electrodes clung to his rough scalp, with thin wires running down across his shoulders like a Medusa wig. His eyelids were closed, and everything about his gaunt face suggested that he was completely unconscious, but the screens above his head told a different story. One screen showed the rugged, zig-zagging lines of his health statistics and heart rate as one would expect to see in such a setting, but it was the second screen that caught Trammel's attention. This one was a whirlwind of swirling pictures and images, all cascading across the screen like an out-of-control acid trip. 
`Is... Is that what I think it is?' said Eric, his voice slow and quivering. 
Greller sniffed, then said, `That's his thought-screen. It displays his unconscious thought processes. What you're seein there is what's goin on in his head.' 
Eric was completely transfixed, staring up at the screen like a slack-jawed simpleton. Picturesque landscapes drifted by in spinning slide-shows; colourful shapes wriggled and writhed across the screen in a reptilian manner; houses and buildings zoomed in and out of view; random, distorted faces and figures came and went in a flash; animals and mythical-looking creatures danced and climbed through moving mazes; and periodically, embedded within this carnival of colour and mayhem, lines of text and numbers would scroll up and down or weave themselves through the activity like a digital snake, its information-filled body representing the sums or riddles that were being processed by the man's subconscious mind. The sight was beyond captivating, and for a long time Trammel was lost in the dreamy colours as they flashed, faded, blended and danced into each other. 
After making a few notes Eric followed Greller as he marched down the corridor towards more cells, each one identical to the last apart from the figure stretched out on the bed. Due to the nature and design of the facility, Greller explained, it was now no longer necessary to house male and female prisoners in separate wings. And as Eric inspected the dozens of cells along A wing he was seeing a wide variety of different inmates, ranging from young men convicted of violent crimes all the way through to elderly women who were being incarcerated on charges of a more fraudulent nature. But the specific crimes and identities of each inmate no longer seemed to matter, as each and every one of them was now sedated and strapped to their bed, and had electrodes protruding from their shaved scalp as they lay there comatose and drooling in an identical manner, with their minds hooked up to this vast system. 
There did seem to be some subtle differences in their composure and resting states, however. Some prisoners, like the first one he saw, appeared to be in a deep sleep with a perfectly still body, with just a slight twitch of the eyelids now and then to remind him that they were indeed still alive. Others, on the other hand, incessantly twitched and squirmed against their restraints, their faces twisted and contorted into painful expressions as the screens above their heads flickered away. As Trammel took all of this in, the nurses and wardens went about their chores and tasks, seemingly indifferent to the peculiarity of it all. 
`Has there been any trouble so far?' Eric asked, nodding towards one of the beefy wardens strolling past them, his fingers wrapped around the handle of his truncheon. `I mean, has anyone woken up from their induced sleep and tried to escape?' 
`Have they hell,' spat Greller, looking up from his gleaming boots. `No one's gonna try to escape from this place. They don't even know they're bloody here, for a start.' 
`You say that as if it's a bad thing.' 
`Maybe it is.' 
`Do you not approve of this place, then?' asked Trammel, even though the answer to the question was obvious. 
`This is supposed to be a punishment, for crying out loud!' said Greller, waving his arm towards the line of cells stretching off into the distance. `We've got serious criminals in here gettin an easy ride! Sleepin away their sentences like babies in cots, completely oblivious to where they actually are.' 
Eric frowned. `You really think they've got it easy?' 
`Damn right they've got it easy. Someone can come in here for murder then wake up after a twenty year sleep, their sentence passin by like a pleasant dream. Ya call that a deterrent?' 
`Only time will tell, I suppose. We have to remember that the old system wasn't working.' 
Eric was challenging Greller's ideas about Swarm, but he was doing it delicately, for it was obvious that the man felt robbed of the hands-on job that he once loved. Disgust oozed out of him every time he was asked about this new approach to incarceration, and Eric sensed it was wise to tread carefully. 
`Sure, give it time,' he grumbled, `but I'm not convinced this place is the miracle solution everyone's painting it to be.' 
Trammel nodded passively, then the two of them walked towards the elevator. 
 
  
Making more notes along the way, Eric followed Greller around the upper wings of the facility, taking in everything he saw. He recorded the cleanliness of the corridors, the sanitisation of each cell, the general well-being of the prisoners, the workload of the nurses, the potential threat to the staff, and the various security drills and procedures that were in place. And, despite the deep, ethical questions that the facility itself raised, he couldn't fault its cleanliness and functionality. However, as he travelled further up towards the apex floor he began to experience a series of strange sensations. 
Walking through the corridor of C wing, the smallest wing in the building which sat just beneath the apex floor, Eric felt a kind of static wash over his body, making all of his tiny hairs stand end-wise. Passing through this corridor, trailing slightly behind Greller as he walked by the cells, his nerves ignited and sang inside his body, teased by some unknown presence in the air. His initial assumption was that this unusual feeling was due to the excessive amount of electrical equipment in the building, especially on the apex floor just above his head, but as the feeling grew in intensity he disregarded this idea. Venturing further along through the different sections of the facility, from its bowels to its upper tip, it felt to Eric like he was walking through a living, breathing organism, a semi-conscious being who was aware of his tiny footsteps pacing along its innards. At various points during the inspection, as he was led through the multitude of doorways, scanners, cells and elevators, he looked over towards Greller to see whether he was feeling this eerie omnipresence too, but he showed no sign of it. Few words had been spoken between them since their exchange down on A wing, so it didn't feel appropriate for Eric to mention this bizarre sensation that he was experiencing, instead he continued to silently take notes as they worked their way to the apex floor. 
  
`This is the Hub,' said Greller, as they reached a set of closed doors outside the lift. 
From the outside, viewed from the landing, the Hub was a fluorescent glow shining out from the small windows set into the entrance doors. 
`It's through there?' asked Trammel, still feeling on edge from the heavy static in the air that only he seemed to be able to sense. 
`That's it. If you need anything else from me, I'll be down on A wing.' 
`But...' 
Trammel turned to ask him something but the lift doors were already closing, leaving him alone on the small landing. 
`Thanks,' he mumbled to himself, then walked gingerly over towards the security panel by the Hub's doors. 
His security card worked, and after the red light on the panel flickered to green the double doors slid open to a sight that took Eric's breath away. He was confronted with a low-ceilinged room that resembled a mix between a plane's cockpit and a video game arcade. His dazed, squinting eyes feasted on the array of LED screens and computer monitors throwing luminescent light over the hunched figures sat at terminals, punctuated by tangles of leads and cables twisting their way across every nook and cranny. Standing there by the doorway, looking awkward and lost, he counted about a dozen technicians in this windowless room, all glued to their computer screens and oblivious to his presence. They appeared to be studying data that was being thrown up from the cells down below, sifting through columns of numbers and equations. 
After the room's dizzying effect had eased off a little, a familiar face caught Trammel's eye halfway along the row of terminals. Staring intensely at his monitor like the other technicians either side of him, Professor Mellish was scrolling down through blocks of text and pictures, fully absorbed in whatever it was that he was doing. Trammel walked over to him and tapped him on the shoulder, unsure of whether he'd be pleased to see him or not. 
`Professor Mellish? I'm Eric Trammel, GLC. McQuade sent me over here to see how things are going.' 
Distracted from his task, the professor jumped and looked up at Eric with the bleary confusion of a dementia victim trying to discern his whereabouts. It took a few seconds for him to adjust himself, but when he did he reached over and shook Trammel's hand, beaming a proud smile. 
`We're still very much in the experimental stages,' he said, now full of confidence, `although the results are already speaking for themselves.' 
`It's, err…it's quite a sight up here. How does it all work, exactly?' 
`We formulate certain questions and send them down through the central computer, then the intuitive, subconscious minds of the patients down below process and evaluate what's been fed to them. Thousands of thoughts and dreams are then presented to us in the form of images, pictures, words, numbers and equations, and after that it's simply a matter of deciphering it all.' 
Eric noticed that Mellish was referring to the inmates as “patients” now, perhaps in an effort to try and make his project seem more humane, but he didn't bother addressing this as his sheer fascination for what he was seeing and hearing was overriding everything for the time being. 
`But…how do you get these images? How can you see into the inmates' minds like this?' 
`It's all done using electrical impulses in the brain. The electrodes, which I'm sure you saw downstairs, monitor brain wave patterns which we then use to work out what each individual is thinking about.' 
Eric's expression must've looked blanker than a plain white sheet of paper, because Mellish chuckled and gave a further explanation. 
`Believe it or not, there's been extensive research in the past concerning reading people's thoughts. Various scientific institutions have used electrical brain activity to record what people see, so there was already a vast bank of knowledge on the subject for us to use.' 
`Hhmm,' mumbled Eric, scratching his chin. `And do you have to decipher the answers yourself?' 
`Most of the time, yes. The results are run through specialist software that scours the seemingly random array of twisting, flickering pictures and jumbled text that's been siphoned from the patients down below, searching for the patterns and answers that are almost always there, picking out the precious pearls of wisdom that no individual person could've produced on their own.' 
`Has this got anything to do with that theory that we only ever use ten percent of our brains?' Trammel asked, suddenly remembering an article he read somewhere once. `I mean, are you tapping into the ninety percent of each inmate's brain that's never used?' 
An embarrassed, half-condescending smile formed across Mellish's face upon hearing this. He cleared his throat, then looked away for a moment while he answered. 
`No, that's not what's happening here. I think that old theory about using only ten percent of our brains is a myth. It just doesn't hold up in an evolutionary sense. Our brains are very expensive organs, using up twenty percent of our body's total energy supply. That's way too costly for us to use only a small part of it,' said the professor, shaking his head. 
`I see,' Eric replied, feeling his cheeks growing warmer. 
`Don't be embarrassed, though, because what we're doing here is vaguely similar. Although the ten percent thing is a myth, I'd say it's certainly true that we hardly ever live up to our full potential. We are all much cleverer and more capable than we realise, and Swarm simply makes full use of each brain that it has access to, especially the subconscious part that usually doesn't get listened to enough.' 
`But what kind of questions have you been asking them? Or should I say...it?' 
Mellish chuckled again at Eric's unease, then replied, `We've tried all kinds of different approaches so far, but we soon discovered that the more abstract a question is, the vaguer the answer will be. For example, mathematical questions will be answered with accuracy, but a question like “Which of these two paintings is the best?” will yield a vague, fuzzy result.' 
`So vague that no consensus could be made from it?' 
`Unfortunately not, but we still don't give up if that happens. Any answers that we can't decipher are passed on to volunteers who work on them as long-term projects.' 
Trammel struggled to comprehend all of this, let alone believe it, and as his own mind became overloaded with thoughts he looked around again at his surroundings, studying the finer details of this futuristic-looking workspace. Everything about it was mesmerising and hypnotic, from the snaking wires and circuit boards fixed to the walls, to the glaring fluorescent light bursting from every screen and monitor. Standing there amongst this array of electrical connections and computing power, Eric had something of an epiphany. He realised that he was standing inside an artificial brain, a giant synthetic mind, with the hundreds of wires and bits of circuitry representing a network of neurons and synapses. The place was an electric neocortex made of steel, copper, glass and silicon, more powerful than any biological equivalent could ever be. 
The air began to grow heavy and stuffy again, as if the unknown presence that he'd felt downstairs had somehow followed him up here to the apex Hub, standing over him as he gazed around in a state of stupefaction. Panic set in, and out of his peripheral vision he could see the professor looking up at him with concern. 
`Are you OK, Eric?' 
`Yes, err, so...what other questions do you plan on asking?' he replied, pulling himself together and feeling embarrassed for the second time. 
`Swarm's function will be to aid society in any way possible,' replied Mellish, his pride resurfacing. `The questions will always be of a benign, benevolent nature, questions designed to gain information that we can use to help the community.' 
Eric wanted to know more about what was going on, but he felt frail and fragile. He was swaying slightly on his feet, and he thought it wise to get away before Mellish noticed the full extent of his discomfort. He thanked the professor for his time then spent a few minutes hovering around on his own, making some loose, shaky notes. He discreetly tried to gauge whether any of the technicians could feel this heavy presence in the air, but once again it seemed like he was alone. He could see no signs of edginess or fear in any of the workers as they sat at their terminals, instead they appeared docile and catatonic, with their glazed eyes transfixed on the rectangular computer screens. 
  
Once he'd produced enough notes to satisfy McQuade's expectations, Trammel skulked away silently to the lift, feeling the deep hum of a thousand volts dull down as the security doors slid closed behind him. Feeling a strong desire to get some fresh air, he quickly got into the lift and pressed the button for the ground floor, leaning against the elevator wall for support. 
Having now seen GLC's revolutionary project up close, his head was a battleground where wonder, confusion, fear and amazement all competed with each other relentlessly. He drove away from the site a changed man. 
 
  
  
Impact on the Town
 
  
After the initial shock of seeing the inner workings of Swarm for the first time had worn off, Trammel began to accept the project a little more. The impact that it was having on the town was impossible to ignore, and the social and economic improvements were undeniable. With this living, breathing, revolutionary structure looming on the visible horizon, the atmosphere in Drachton seemed to change overnight. 
The pessimistic, hopeless thoughts that'd dominated Eric's life for so long had eased, and now, when the police sirens screamed past his apartment window, he was soothed by the knowledge that a powerful force was finally here to tackle crime, a profound beast that promised to establish some kind of stability, law and order. Lying alone in bed at night, he no longer lamented over his wife's death, instead he considered the positives that the future may bring. His dreams were lighter and less intense, and waking up each morning to face the world was no longer a chore. 
 
  
 
 
  
From the Academic Notes of Professor Mellish
 
  
As well as mimicking the behaviour of swarming animals and insects, Swarm makes great use of the power of the subconscious mind. 
Each and every one of us has a conscious mind and a subconscious (sometimes referred to as unconscious) mind, the subconscious being a kind of deeper, automated system that works on its own. It's incredible how many people, to this day, are still unaware of this part of themselves. 
The subconscious mind is actually larger (figuratively speaking) than the conscious mind. The most obvious example (and the one I like to point out to junior colleagues), is the fact that we often don't even choose our own thoughts and words. Our thoughts and words simply `pop into' our heads, rising up from some deeper part of ourselves. Pay attention to it and you'll see. Whether in conversation with a friend, making a speech, or perhaps even talking to yourself in your head, your words and thoughts are delivered to you from another place. 
Most people have experienced the sensation of not being able to remember a word, then going out for a walk or occupying yourself in some other task for a while, then having the forgotten word suddenly `pop into' your head when you try to recall it afterwards. Despite having thought about other things entirely during your walk, the previously forgotten word is right there, available to you. Did you find the word, or did your subconscious find it? 
  
Hypnotists have been aware of this phenomenon for years. Hypnotists speak directly to a person's subconscious mind when they're in a trance-like state, feeding instructions to the deeper part of their brain. 
Myself and the rest of the technicians operate in a similar manner; we are like hypnotists to the patients. They are in an unconscious sleep, and we feed questions to the deeper part of their brains. Who knows what we'll be able to discover? Who knows what hidden gems we'll be able to dig up? 
 
  
 
  
Commercial Enterprise
 
  
As soon as Swarm's mathematical and predictive capability was well-known and well-understood, its services were hired out to all kinds of people. Stockbrokers and investors from all over paid huge sums of money for stock market predictions, gamblers paid for horse racing and football predictions, and a wide range of companies and businesses handed over significant amounts of cash for the Hive Mind to predict their products' chances of success in the retail market. The Swarm facility quickly became a commercial enterprise as well as a correctional facility, but with all of the town's debts paid off and a repair and refurbishment plan in progress using the new source of income, there were few who objected to the facility's new-found role in society. 
  
Visible changes across Drachton were there for everyone to see. The rotting, crumbling infrastructure was being fixed and transformed before everyone's eyes, and the sagging facades of the shop-fronts and warehouses were receiving their long overdue face-lifts. Unexpected little perks began to spring up here and there as well. Weather forecasts, for example, were always accurate now. Atmospheric data was routinely fed into Swarm's hive mind, so that it could calculate and predict the weather patterns that were most likely to follow. No bout of rain or sleet ever fell upon the town without the community being well-prepared for it. 
 
  
 
  
From the Academic Notes of Professor Mellish
 
  
Whenever I lecture about the huge role that the subconscious mind plays in each of our lives, I often use language as the main example. Each and every one of us can speak our native language, using complex rules of syntax and grammar, but if asked to explain these rules of grammar in a precise way, most of us will struggle. 
Before we say each sentence, do we have to consciously think: subject, verb, object before we describe a man eating a sandwich? Do we have to consciously think: size, colour, material before describing a big red shiny car? No, of course we don't. We just...know it. We know it without knowing that we know it. 
Like I've stated previously, we do not consciously choose our words, they are chosen for us. 
  
It's this part of the mind that I, and the rest of the technicians, are tapping into every time we send a question down to the patients. We all know a lot more than we realise. What kind of information might we be able to mine from so many subconscious minds all at once? What might result from such a conglomeration of power and knowledge? 
 
  
 
  
Tourist Attraction
 
  
McQuade continued to delegate the job of inspecting the wings of the facility to Trammel, and he in turn continued to carry out the job to the best of his ability. During his last couple of visits to the Swarm compound, however, he'd started to notice pockets of people loitering around the perimeter fence of the grounds, much to his surprise and bewilderment. And, sure enough, as he drove up the winding lane that led to the facility on this particular day he could see that they were still there. 
His initial presumption when he first saw these groups was that they were there to take photographs of the new facility out of a kind of admiration for it, and this idea gained further credence when he saw them all again in an even greater number, peering through the gaps in the wire fence towards the glistening silver pyramid as if it were a famous landmark to be revered. 
There were perhaps two dozen of them scattered around on the grass by the site entrance, talking and shuffling about in a weary, tired manner as though they'd been there for hours on end. For a brief second, as Eric was pulling up by the security barrier, he thought he saw a sleeping bag rolled up on the grass next to someone's feet, but security ushered him into the site before he could fully make out what it was. 
  
Now that Swarm's success had taken off Trammel expected Greller's attitude to become less hostile, but on the contrary it seemed to just get worse and worse. The old-school warden's demeanour had become increasingly tetchy as the weeks had gone by, and as Eric entered A wing to start another routine patrol of the premise he greeted him in the manner of someone noticing their in-laws arriving on a surprise visit, reluctantly nodding and perfunctorily going through the motions of courtesy. 
`Are they out there every day?' said Eric, breaking the moody silence hanging over them. 
`Huh?' 
`Those people out by the gates.' 
Greller tutted and shook his head in contempt. `Yeah, every bloody day. I tell ya, this place is turnin into a damn tourist attraction. We had someone tryin to run in through the gates the other day. I've never known anythin like it.' 
`How are the inmates?' 
`Sleepin away like babies, as usual. I'm not sure whether I should be watching over them or puttin dummies in their mouths.' 
`I can put that down as a suggestion and pass it on to management if you like.' 
Greller gave Eric a side glance that could've floored a rhinoceros, then they continued to walk in silence. 
Passing through the wings, Eric could see that every cell was now occupied, new bodies splayed out on beds like a flux of coma victims. Once again he studied the flashing, cascading thoughts of every individual he passed as he made his way up to the apex hub, staring at the digital thought-screens to see whether he could spot some pearl of wisdom or miraculous insight fresh from the source. As these screens flashed and flickered over the bed-bound forms, with the wires and electrodes protruding from their shaved scalps like strands of wiry hair, he realised that he could've lost himself for hours in their displayed brain activity if he had the time. Every thought-screen was a psychedelic journey, a mind tunnel that pulled you into its unpredictable sequence of events, mesmerising the viewer with its distorted, alternate reality. 
The more Trammel was exposed to this set-up, with the thousands of brains hooked up to the central computer, the more he began to see each brain as merely another processing unit, with each inmate serving as an extra piece of computing power to the system as a whole. With the glowing lights in each cell washing over him, drawing him towards the screens with their hypnotic grip, he forgot all about his recent worries and concerns and instead felt absorbed by the sheer strength of the building in which he stood. The ethics of the project, and the effect it was having on certain members of society, was irrelevant as long as he was immersed in one of the thought-screens with its kaleidoscopic show of subconscious thoughts, the twisting figures, melting landscapes, scaly reptiles and lines of digits pulling him in like a child to a bright fairground. 
  
Professor Mellish had now developed an air of confidence that bordered on arrogance, but Eric could hardly blame him as his invention was proving itself to be a roaring success, and he was the mastermind behind all of the hype. He was sat at a terminal when Eric entered the Hub, studying digits and numbers with the careful diligence of a watchmaker. 
`Trammel? Is it that time already?' 
`Everything running smoothly?' 
`Like clockwork. You can tell McQuade that everything's under control.' 
Eric made a few notes and fired away some routine questions, then once he was done he asked the professor something that he'd been privately pondering for a while. 
`So, how do you feel about this place being hired out the way it is?' 
`How do you mean?' 
`You know, the stockbrokers and bankers who are paying for estimates. That isn't what Swarm was intended for, was it?' 
Mellish leaned back in his chair and rubbed his eyes. `Look, we're making huge contributions to the town, and even to humanity as a whole, for that matter. If we end up making a little bit of extra money on the side as well, then…so be it.' 
`Contributions to humanity as a whole?' 
Surprised—and almost offended by—the doubting of his precious system, Mellish proceeded to boast about Swarm's latest achievements. `Here,' he said, opening up a new page on his screen, `take a look at this.' 
Eric was looking down at a long list of strange names. At first, he couldn't work out what they were. 
`You see this here?' Mellish tapped the screen with his pen. `This is a list of diseases that'll soon be abolished, thanks to the vaccines that we've recently discovered. We fed every patient in this facility questions relating to the infectious strategies of each illness, along with the problems of our current medicines, and after my team spent days sifting through the hundreds of images and blocks of text spewed up by the collective consciousness, we were able to work out effective cures and formulas that had eluded humankind for decades.' 
Trammel looked down at the long list again, having no choice but to feel a strong sense of pride and admiration for what the professor had achieved. 
`The relevant vaccines and medicines are being put into production as we speak,' said Mellish, rather smugly. `Soon, the public will no longer have to endure these cruel afflictions which have caused unlimited pain and suffering to previous generations.' 
Eric thought about this for a moment. Eventually, he muttered, `But...how?' 
`How what?' 
`How can these convicts know anything about medicine? Where did the knowledge come from?' 
The professor looked up at Eric with a sage-like stare, a wise look that made him pay attention. 
`The subconscious mind knows more than the conscious mind realises, Trammel. Swarm combines the minds of thousands, then its software finds links and patterns in the many generated thoughts, presenting them to us so that we then just have to decipher the clues and harvest the genius that's in there. The answers are always going to be there, too, we just have to find them.' 
  
How could he argue with a response like that? He thanked the professor for his time, filled out his weekly report sheets in a mild daze and then left, leaving the technicians to their analytical work. Walking away from the claustrophobic tomb of black cables and glaring monitors, Trammel was genuinely taken back by the ground-breaking work that Mellish was putting into motion. The facility was now presenting itself in a different light. If the human brain was nature's computer, Eric realised, then Swarm was nature's search engine, and as he drove out the gates of the compound he wondered what was going to be searched for next. 
 
  
 
 
  
From the Academic Notes of Professor Mellish
 
  
I would like to record some of my thoughts regarding swarm intelligence, along with a great example. As well as making good use of the subconscious mind, the Swarm facility makes use of the collective wisdom of crowds. The best way to explain this phenomenon is by outlining `The Parable of the Ox' story. 
  
In the autumn of 1906, the British scientist Francis Galton attended the annual West of England fat stock and poultry exhibition, a regional fair where local farmers and townspeople gathered to praise the quality of each other's cattle. 
On this particular day, there was a weight judging competition. An ox had been selected and placed on display, and members of the crowd had to place bets on the weight of the animal. Eight hundred people placed bets. Most people guessed way off the mark, but after the event was over Galton borrowed the tickets from the organisers and ran some statistical tests on them. The main test involved adding all of the contestants' estimates together, then dividing that number by the number of contestants to get the mean number. 
That mean number, you could say, represented the collective wisdom of the crowd. If the crowd were a single person, that was how much he or she would have guessed the ox weighed. The crowd (as a single unit) had guessed that the ox weighed 1197 pounds. Its actual weight was just one pound heavier: 1198 pounds. 
  
This story highlights the potential wisdom of crowds, and it's for this reason that Swarm's software also includes mean number calculation. This is especially useful for number-related questions regarding stock market predictions, sales forecasts and gambling figures, etc. 
It's a rather startling fact that a large group of amateurs are usually more efficient than a small group of experts when it comes to making predictions. And the more diverse the crowd is in terms of knowledge and experience, the more accurate the prediction will be. People often ask me how a group of convicts can come up with accurate predictions, and I've received a lot of skepticism from certain critics of my facility for this very reason, but I hope that as time goes on the mechanisms and inner-workings behind my facility are better understood. 
Traditional prison systems are extremely efficient at wasting human potential, i.e. locking prisoners away in empty rooms, but my system is extremely efficient at harnessing human potential, and the results are speaking for themselves. 
 
  
 
  
Carrack House
 
  
The inspections were only required once every seven days, and so for the rest of his working week Trammel was kept busy with a variety of other tasks. It was a weekday morning, and he'd been called in to see McQuade for another job. 
As he drove along Drachton's main arterial roads on his way to HQ, Eric soaked up the scenes all around him, his refreshed, expectant eyes searching for more signs of Swarm's impact. The county courthouse passed by on the right-hand-side as he sped along. It was an old building with large concrete steps leading up to the entrance. The sight of it brought back bad memories for Trammel, memories of his wife's death. Shortly after his wife's killing he was informed that he could attend the trial of the killer at this very courthouse, but he'd been too distraught to do so. He never looked forward to driving past the old court building, but today things were slightly different. 
It'd been announced a few days ago that Drachton's entire court system had been shaken up and reinvented, with Swarm now being the authoritative power that solved all criminal cases. The very concept of judge and jury had been rendered obsolete, as Swarm now occupied both of these roles combined—and then some. The all-knowing, Infinitely-Wise Sage could solve any kind of trial without risk of serving an injustice, and few doubted its ability. In effect Swarm was, to the court, an extended, expanded jury consisting of thousands of people instead of a mere handful. Was the suspect guilty of theft? Easy. Feed the background history of the individual in question through the cables of the Mighty Mind, along with all of the accumulated evidence of the case, and then let the all-knowing, all-seeing Wise One decide. Was the suspect guilty of murder? Simple. Present the Hive Mind with all of the known facts and clues, and then let the combined force of thousands of subconscious minds work out what really happened. 
Due to this complete revamp of the criminal courts, historical cold cases were now being re-opened and solved, and arrests were being made decades after forgotten crimes had been committed. The irony of using convicted criminals to decide the outcomes of criminal proceedings didn't go unnoticed by some, but with a faultless, impeccable record with consistent results, Swarm was winning over more hearts and minds than it was turning away. 
And its influence didn't stop there, of course. Driving on down the road, watching the stream of traffic whiz by in the other lane, Eric also remembered that every driver's insurance policy was now decided and calculated using the acute mathematical power of Swarm—yet another area of law that the Hive Mind seemed well-equipped and well-suited to deal with. 
  
The atmosphere inside the GLC headquarters building was vibrant and alive. Swarm's mounting success had lifted the spirits of both the upper and lower level staff, and upon entering the building Trammel was greeted with a kind of fervent positivity from everyone he interacted with. 
McQuade was sat at his desk like a grumpy toad, bundles of papers stacked in front of him, and he waved Eric in with his thick hand. 
`I need you to visit one of the old high-rise blocks over in Central District today, Eric. It's called Carrack House. There's a community of squatters living in there, and the council needs us to get them out before the refurbishments can start.' 
Eric's face dropped at the prospect of a lengthy, forceful eviction procedure. 
`Don't worry,' said McQuade, reading his expression, `all I need you to do today is issue some eviction forms to comply with regulations. I've got somebody to go with you, although you shouldn't encounter any trouble just dishing out papers.' He slapped an envelope down on the desk like a hammer blow. `Here are the notices. I need them all served.' 
Eric picked up the envelope and headed downstairs, wondering what the day might bring. 
 
  
The partner Eric had been given to accompany him on this job was an unassuming, subdued young man from somewhere in the admin department. He wouldn't exactly constitute ideal backup if things were to turn ugly, Eric thought, but he was grateful for him being there all the same. It took them around half an hour to find the place, driving through the dusty streets of Central District with boarded-up shops passing by on each corner, and trails of litter blowing along the curbs. When they eventually pulled up and parked the car outside Carrack House, they got out and took in the grim sight before them. 
Gazing up at the crumbling building, up towards the rows of flaking window frames and cracked concrete, Eric wondered how many people could possibly be living in such a place. The block had been built decades ago during Drachton's former glory days, but, like numerous other blocks in the district, it'd become a dwelling-place for criminals, driving away decent citizens one by one until only the undesirables remained. Following a series of recent raids and arrests the building had been cleared out and emptied, providing an opportunity for squatters and vagrants to move in. 
After spending a few minutes looking the place over and exchanging some nervous words, a rough plan of action was established, and they walked over towards the block's communal entrance, stepping over an array of bin bags, discarded take away boxes and syringes that were scattered across the pavement. 
  
A lot of the old flats were empty, and for a while they encountered nothing except abandoned living spaces, hollowed-out shells that lined the landings and walkways with their splintered door frames. Some flats were indeed occupied, but the tenants displayed little aggression. Occasionally they came across a locked door with a stubborn squatter who refused to open up, but rather than trying to force entry, risking a backlash of violence and confrontation, Eric chose to slide the eviction notices under the rotting wood of the door frames, completing his task without unnecessarily disturbing the peace. 
Adopting this diplomatic manner, they worked their way up through the floors, serving a notice to each and every property whichever way they could. They were around thirty minutes into the operation and they still hadn't encountered any serious problems, so by all accounts their morale should've been high, but instead the two of them seemed to be falling prey to a growing sense of unease the higher up the building they went. Both of them felt it, this unsettling atmosphere that hung in the air around the upper tenements, a hostility that simmered from the mouldy surfaces and crumbling doorsteps. The demeanour of those they encountered became more twisted and deranged as they climbed the staircase to each subsequent floor, as if being up at an elevated level exposed them to some unknown, influential force. On and on this went, this sense of impending doom that intensified with each floor, until finally they gained a clue as to what was going on. 
They were up on the twelfth floor when they saw it. 
Confronted with a busted front door, hanging slack from its hinges from what was probably a recent police raid, Eric and his partner approached the open apartment to investigate. A hallway lined with ancient wallpaper led through to a living-room out back, and they began creeping tentatively towards it. A rustling sound could be heard coming from somewhere up ahead, so they knew that somebody was home. 
`Hello? Who's there?' Eric said, with his companion close behind him. 
His voice vibrated through the dingy hallway, but there was no reply. The rustling sound rose up again, however, as did another sound, like a series of retreating footsteps. 
`There's no need to be afraid, I'm just here to serve a notice.' 
The scuffling noise ceased, and after a brief nod of heads the two men tip-toed through the hallway into the main room of the property to see who was in there. Turning a corner within the inside of the apartment Eric saw a dark, silhouetted figure standing by a window, a slim, scruffy outline of a man who stood completely motionless. A dazzling grey light shone in through this window making it hard for Eric to see properly, but when his vision adjusted he could just make out the man's ragged features as he stood there like a cornered animal, his eyes bulging out through a thick layer of grime and an unwashed tuft of beard. Keeping a non-threatening distance away, Eric held one of the notices out to him. 
`Here. I just need to give you this.' 
The fear that emanated from the squatter was electrifying. The greasy lines of his face screwed up in terror as the notice was extended towards him. Ignoring the paper in Eric's hand, he focused his attention instead on the front of his jacket, apparently searching for a badge or an ID card. 
`G...G... GLC!' 
The man's gravelly voice rang around the room, the sheer desperation of it sending a faint shiver down Trammel's spine. He gently confirmed that he was indeed from GLC, but the response that he got in return indicated that it may have been unwise to do so. 
`No! Y... You're not taking me away! I won't... I won't let you do it!' 
The poor man was clearly delirious. His soiled clothes hung from his rake-like frame as though they were still on a coat hanger, and Eric could smell waves of potent body odour as he shuffled and trembled to and fro, backing away towards the corner. 
`Look, I'm not here to take you away, but you're going to have to move on very soon. This building is about to be reclaimed.' 
`I won't be a part of it!' he cried, his nicotine and crack pipe-stained teeth peeking out through the whiskers of his beard. `I won't! I... I won't let it take me!' 
`What do you—' 
`It'll never take me! It'll take the others, but it'll never take me!' 
During this wild outburst, Eric noticed that the man had thrown a hand up in the air whilst shouting and yelling, an erratic gesture towards the window behind him. With his eyes now fully adjusted to the light, Eric looked out through the large window, over towards the spot where the man's yellowed fingernail had pointed. There was a faint speck in the distance, a tiny blot out on the near-horizon, and Eric knew at once what it was, its mirrored surface and triangular structure completely unmistakeable. And it was at this precise moment that he felt a tap on his arm, a nudge from his colleague who stood behind him. His partner had spotted something on the wall directly behind them, something that both of them had failed to notice since entering the room. 
When Eric saw it his heart sank and his veins ran cold with ice. 
There was an image on the wall stretching from skirting board to ceiling, and it was made from marks of varying colours and textures. Eric's eyes darted over the wild array of overlapping strokes and splashes, trying to make some sense and order out of it all. There were countless marks splattered up the wall, frantic strokes that snaked and twisted up like scars from some heroic battle. The markings appeared random and careless at first, but taking a few steps back, Trammel could see that they all conjoined to form a geometric shape. Most of the markings had a dull brown or red hue, causing him to make morbid speculations as to what had been used for paint, but for the moment he was completely lost in its intricacy. The marks were images of true expression, marks that could only have been executed during the throes of wild passion and mania. The hundreds of dashes, drips, angles and swirls created a maze for the eye to roam around in, and Trammel felt as though he were at the mercy of this formation as he stood before it. The subject of this piece of art should've been obvious to him from the start, but he'd initially been too shocked and entranced by its details to consciously acknowledge it. The overall shape of the painting had three sides, with a wide base and a narrowing tip. Standing before this complex piece of graffiti, pulling himself out of its labyrinth of strokes and lines, Eric realised that he was looking at a giant pyramid—an artistic representation of Swarm. 
On the presumption that the painting had been done by the current occupant of the dwelling, Eric turned back around to face him, only to find that at some point over the last few minutes he'd disappeared somewhere, scarpering through to the shadowy depths of the old flat while both of their backs had been turned. 
An intense look was exchanged between Eric and his colleague. They both knew that this picture on the wall was symbolic of something sinister, that there was a buried sentiment underneath the various markings that made it, a buried message that had to be felt as well as seen. The painting took on a new meaning when combined with the fear of the man who'd been in the room, a new layer of depth added to its markings when viewed through the echoes of the man's terror-stricken voice. 
Without actually exchanging any words on the subject, without discussing this eerie feeling that they obviously both shared, the two of them both knew that whoever created this image had been taken over by a primordial instinct, an inherited animal instinct that carried a wisdom far greater than either of them could apprehend. With the Swarm facility visible outside the window, sitting on the near-horizon like a rising tooth protruding from the gums of the earth, this image looked more and more like a warning sign, a danger signal forged in blood that contained an ancient ancestral knowledge. 
Once again Trammel was reminded of the impact that this new structure was having on the town, this new presence that was weaving itself into the fabric of society more and more each day. The conflicting views that'd been battling away in his head ever since his first visit to the facility were now competing with each other once again, and he was forced to reconsider the dangers of introducing a power as great as Swarm's in such a rushed, carefree manner. 
A huge weight was suddenly pressing down upon him, a burden of knowledge that he didn't want to have. In that moment, as he stood before the painting with Swarm outside the window on the horizon, he instinctively knew that something monumental was on the cusp of happening, some explosion of force borne from the super-power that sat inside the mirrored pyramid in the distance. 
They left the apartment in complete silence, and only with a push of determination were they able to finish serving out the rest of the eviction notices. With the image of the painting etched firmly in his mind's eye Eric climbed the building's staircase with his work colleague in tow, both of them now connected by an unspoken knowledge. 
  
Small details began to jump out at them as they completed the rest of their work, previously unseen markings that'd been scratched into paintwork and etched onto windows. From the first moment they'd entered the block earlier on Eric had noticed that the place was covered in graffiti but he'd paid little attention to it, walking past the tags and scribblings as if they weren't there. But now, after what he'd just witnessed in the flat, he studied it all intensely. Looking closely at the handwritten words and symbols that were sprawled across the bannisters, walls and doors on each floor, he was noticing dozens of references to Swarm, some direct and others indirect. On every landing there was a triangle drawn in paint or felt pen in some place or other, and above the opening of a rubbish chute on one of the upper floors, the word “SWARM” had actually been spelled out in red ink. 
And the hostility of the residents grew worse with each new floor. Doors were slammed shut as they approached, and venomous cries could be heard from behind them, resonating along the landings. Compared to the relative calm of the lower floors, this upper part of the building had a real air of desperation to it, so much so that there were moments when Eric felt as though he was walking through the inside of a mental institution, with the shouting and cursing ringing in his ears. 
It occurred to him, as he rose higher and higher up into the block, that the residents of the upper floors may have become more fearful and stir-crazy than the others simply because they could see the Swarm facility out of their windows. Perhaps having a clear view of the structure in their line of sight, having it there as a permanent backdrop as they festered and trudged through their drug-addled days, was having a profound effect on their psyche. It was undeniable that there was an insanity up at the top of the old high-rise block, and however far-fetched it seemed to him, he was starting to believe that this may have been the source of it all. 
By the time they reached the top floor the psychosis had grown out of control. They were trying their best to hand out the last of the notices, passing them over to the wild-eyed faces who opened their doors, slipping them under the cracks of those who didn't, when a noise began to rise up through the entire building. The screaming and cursing had been constant for the last half an hour, but this noise was different. The noise that rose up from the centre of the stairwell was more like a chorus of voices working in twisted harmony, a pained, primal scream accumulating from the floors of squatters residing beneath them. There was still a bundle of notices to dish out, but as this deep growl stirred and grew in volume below them, they both knew that it was time to leave. Throwing the remaining papers down on the sticky concrete floor, Eric and his colleague bolted down the spiral staircase, drowning in the noise of torment and lunacy as crazed, maniacal faces peered at them through half-open doorways. 
  
After dashing back to the car and throwing themselves inside, they screeched away from the decrepit flats, feeling dozens of eyes peering down at them from the crumbling balconies and grimy windows. With his hands clasped tightly around the steering wheel and his foot pressed firmly on the pedal, Trammel could see now that the Swarm project had truly permeated into the community's core, stealing the minds of those outside of its reach as well as in it, its growing, hungry presence reaching out and snatching the lost souls lurking in the forgotten corners of the town.  
  
A Date with Death
 
  
A few days later, when Trammel was still recovering from the shock of what he'd seen in the old tower block, McQuade called him into his office again and gave him another surprise. 
`What's this?' Eric asked, studying a small card that he'd been given. 
`It's for your medical, Eric.' 
`Medical?' 
`Yes, medical. You know: doctors, stethoscopes, blood pressure, heart rate, pissing into plastic cups. A medical! The address is on the card. You're booked in for 10am.' 
McQuade was acting strangely. His domineering presence was worse than usual, lacking any kind of respect at all. He was hardly looking at Eric as he spoke, directing his attention instead on some unseen object in his drawer. 
`Well, yes, but why do I have to have a medical?' he asked, both flummoxed and offended by this random demand. 
`It's a new policy. Everyone will have to do it. Just remember to take that card with your results with you on your next inspection of Swarm.' 
`Take my medical results to the Swarm facility? What on Earth for?' 
McQuade's keg chest expanded as he took in an angry, impatient breath. `Look, just do what I ask, will you? Can't you see I'm busy?' 
`Well, I apologise if I'm keeping you from your work,' said Eric, his irritation giving him a burst of courage, `but I think this warrants some kind of explanation.' 
McQuade was momentarily caught off guard by Eric's tone; he wasn't used to being pressed in such a manner. After clearing his throat, he said, `It's…It's just to comply with the new DDP policy.' 
`DDP policy? What's—' 
`Oh, come on Trammel! What's gotten into you today? Are you rebelling against something? Should I be worried? Are you going to start a union or something?' 
Eric was stunned. He couldn't believe he was being spoken to like this; not even by McQuade. `Well, would it be too much to simply ask what “DDP” stands for?' 
Three words then reached Eric's ears from the other side of the desk, three haunting words that span around his head like a phantom trio: `Death Date Policy.' 
`What? Are…Are you saying what I think you're saying?' 
McQuade's thin layer of patience had run out. `Listen to me, Trammel! You need to do a medical, and then you need to take the results with you during your next inspection of Swarm. Do you want me to write it down on a Post-it note and stick it on your forehead so you don't forget? Just do it! Don't get on the wrong side of me today!' 
For the first time since his employment with GLC, Trammel felt genuinely violated. If he was reading the situation correctly, if he wasn't just having some kind of awful dream, he was actually being ordered to let Swarm estimate the date that he would die on. He stormed out of the office, feeling giddy with anger and disbelief. 
  
Eric followed his orders and went through with the medical, but throughout the whole process he was trying to work out what was really going on. It was clear that the Swarm project was now being abused, but he wasn't entirely sure why. The best theory that he could come up with was that the council authorities or GLC were taking money from life insurance companies in exchange for citizen's Death Date data. This would benefit insurance companies because they could then avoid insuring people who were destined to die in the near future, thus avoiding expensive family pay-outs. If this was true, a line had certainly been crossed by someone. Providing stockbrokers and gamblers with data was one thing, but providing life insurance companies with death data for dishonest purposes was quite another. 
It was clear that Eric wasn't the only one opposed to this new policy either, for as he drove towards the Swarm facility after his medical examination, carrying the results of his tests in his plastic folder, he could see that the small pockets of people loitering outside the perimeter fence of the grounds were also up in arms about it. These people had grown in number, now resembling a sizeable crowd, and the vibes that they were giving off had dramatically changed. Eric estimated that there must've been around a hundred of them spread across the field, some of them chanting and some of them waving home-made signs and placards. His earlier suspicion of some of them sleeping on the field overnight was confirmed as well, because there were now a handful of erected tents scattered around between them. 
He had no idea who these people really were or how they found out about the DDP policy, but they were certainly making their presence known. There were cold stares and hateful glances aplenty as Trammel pulled up at the site entrance, the atmosphere completely hostile and unwelcoming, his visible link to GLC sufficient proof for these people that he was somehow to blame for this recent outrage. The last thing he heard before driving through the security barrier were the words Down with DDP, which were yelled out from somewhere among the jostling crowd. 
  
After another routine inspection of the facility, Eric made his way up to the Hub. He was terrified of what he might be about to discover. The idea of simply backing out and refusing to comply with the DDP policy crossed his mind, but he wasn't prepared to do that. He was too fascinated by the Swarm project to jeopardise his involvement within it by upsetting his superiors and possibly losing his job, and besides, it was apparent that he would be forced by law to comply with this insane policy whether he was a GLC employee or not. Did he really have to know his own Death Date, or was it only compulsory that Swarm—as well as the insurance companies and the authorities—knew? Would every ordinary citizen be forced to discover how many more days they had left to live? Did it work differently for GLC staff? These details were unknown to him, and this only added to his anxiety as he ascended in the elevator to the upper floor of the building. 
Walking up to Mellish's workstation, medical results in hand, Eric felt like a condemned man walking up to the gallows. Mellish's appearance and attitude didn't help, either. There was something different about him, too, just like there was with McQuade, some change in his posture or tone of voice that didn't sit well. He seemed to know what Eric was there to do without being asked, and he avoided eye contact wherever possible. 
`Don't look so worried, Trammel,' he said, with a sardonic grin. `You look healthy enough.' 
`What's this all about, Professor? What the hell's going on here?' 
`What do you mean?' 
`You told me that Swarm's power was going to be used for benign purposes. This is clearly an abuse of power! It shouldn't be happening!' 
`Yeah…' said Mellish, vacantly. `But orders are orders.' 
`Who's orders? And for what purpose?' 
`It's out of my hands, Eric. I may have designed this facility, but I'm not really the one who pulls the strings.' 
Pass the buck, thought Trammel. And he had the feeling he'd get the same kind of response from whoever he asked. `So, am I obliged to see the actual date of my death with my own eyes?' he asked, shakily, as Mellish typed the data from his medical card into the mainframe computer and clicked “send”. 
`Not at all. This information is essentially for whoever's paying for it. If you don't want to know, I can just pass the details on to HQ without you seeing them.' 
Eric was swaying on his feet. Even though he knew he didn't have to see Swarm's prediction, he simultaneously knew that he wouldn't be able to resist looking. The temptation would be too great for his curious mind, too alluring in a sickly way. As his medical information was being exposed to the many brains down in the cells, scrutinised and examined by the super-consciousness below his feet, he trembled with a feeling of helplessness. `So, are…are we going to see pictures, or anything like that?' he stammered. 
`No, not really. We're asking Swarm a fairly straightforward, mathematical question, so we'll get a simple, numerical answer. It's only when Swarm's confronted with broad, abstract questions that it produces its vivid, visual displays,' replied Mellish, matter-of-factly. `Ah, here we are.' 
Mellish clicked a link and began to open a page, sending Eric's pulse racing to the point where he thought he might faint. 
`Do you want to see this or not?' 
`Yes, go on. My life's a shambles as it is, so I might as well have the comfort of knowing when it's going to end.' 
`That's the spirit. Anyway, as I say, you look fit and healthy enough so you should have at least a few more years left in you.' 
`Thanks for the support,' mumbled Trammel, through gritted teeth. 
A date then appeared on the screen. Eric was too dizzy to properly see it at first, but he could tell that it wasn't a cause for immediate concern. 
`There you go,' said Mellish. `There's no need to write a will just yet.' 
Eric stared at the date like a dazed rabbit staring down the end of a shotgun barrel. It was true that it wasn't too bad, but still, now that this date was known to him he feared that he may never be able to fully relax ever again. His existence had been altered in a radical way, and there was nothing he could really do about it now. As the professor casually leaned over towards a printer to tear off a printed version of his official Death Date, Eric wanted to press him further about who's idea this was and why it was even being done, but he felt too sapped and drained by what'd just happened to him to pursue it any further. The claustrophobic, cable-filled room began to spin around him as he prepared to leave, a dreadful unease stirring inside him with the knowledge that a rubicon had been crossed, siphoning away some element of spontaneity or surprise from his life. 
  
Without any solid memory of leaving the facility Eric found himself out in the car park in a daze, listening to the distant chants of the protesters outside the gates. Torn between joy and sadness, relief and despair, not really knowing what to think or feel at all, he got back in his car and exited the compound. 
What was he to think of the Swarm project after today? Could he uphold the proud enthusiasm he'd felt shortly after its completion? Or were the events of today a step too far? These questions were unanswerable for the time being, but one thing was certain: the people around him were changing, and morals were slipping. Somewhere along the line, at some level of management, a loosening of integrity had occurred, and Eric intended to keep a close eye on all of his colleagues from now on. 
 
  
 
 
  
Tackling Crime at the Root
 
  
The crowd outside the Swarm facility continued to grow. And not only did the numbers rise, but the temperament also shifted steadily in a dangerous direction. The people were louder and more aggressive, their chants and cries audible from at least a quarter of a mile away from the access road. But as well as this transmogrification and rise in tension, a visible dichotomy formed among them as well, resulting in two opposing groups. 
These two rival gangs, kept apart by the guards at the site entrance, were in the throes of angry passion as Eric drove cautiously towards the security barrier, yelling obscenities at each other from over the top of the guards' heads. The sight of this commotion taking place shocked Eric, and he slowed the car down to take in the bizarre scene. To his eyes there were at least three hundred people dotted across the muddy fields now, with dozens of tents and sleeping bags scattered all over the place. Numerous placards and banners were now tied to the perimeter fence, and megaphones were being used by various people in order to gain more attention. 
Trammel squinted through the window to try and read some of the handwritten cardboard signs and painted sheets of fabric. He saw messages such as: 
  
SWARM HAS GONE TOO FAR 
STOP THE INVASION OF PRIVACY 
NO TO DDP/RRP 
  
These were clearly slogans of an anti-Swarm nature, but, looking over towards the other side of the grounds, over towards the opposing group, Eric saw messages of a different kind, slogans that indicated support of the machine that now controlled the town: 
  
LET SWARM GUIDE US 
THE MIGHTY MIND KNOWS BEST 
LET SWARM CHOOSE THE NEXT GENERATION 
  
Reading these signs, Eric sensed that another new policy had been introduced which he was currently unaware of. When he eventually pulled up at the security gates, he found himself wondering what the letters “RRP” stood for. 
As usual, his very presence at the entrance gates seemed to cause excitement among the crowds, so he swiftly wound his window back up after flashing his ID card, and then activated the central locking. 
It was a wise move. 
Before he had a chance to enter the compound hands began to slap across the panels of the car, and its suspension rocked and creaked as angry anti-Swarm protesters pulled at the doors to get at him. The guards did everything they could to keep them back, and he was quickly ushered through before things got any worse. As he walked into the building after parking his car, mace was being used on some of the troublesome protesters. 
  
The mood inside the Swarm facility was evasive and subdued, and Trammel noticed that even the lower-level employees had begun to behave differently. The reception staff he'd become familiar with no longer greeted him in a friendly manner, and the nurses seemed cold and distant. It was as though everyone was distracted by some unseen force, their attention occupying some other realm. Even Greller didn't seem to be his usual self. There was an absent air about him, too, and after carrying out a full inspection of the lower wings with little more than an uneasy silence lingering between them, Trammel finally went up to see Mellish on the top floor, wondering what kind of mood the professor would be in today. 
  
`What's RRP?' Eric asked, sitting down next to the professor at his computer terminal. 
Mellish looked tired, sporting the look of someone who'd been kept awake all night pondering over some disturbing internal conflict. His face was ashen, even under the unnatural glare of the fluorescent lights. `Just another new policy,' he mumbled, with only a brief glance away from the screen. 
`Yes, I gathered that. But what is it?' 
`It's just about reproductive rights.' 
There was a hollow tone to Mellish's voice, as though the words were being delivered autonomously rather than deliberately. 
`Reproductive Rights Policy?' Eric said, suddenly guessing the abbreviation. `You're not seriously telling me—' 
`It's just a new measure to tackle crime. We don't want to start slipping back into decadence again, so we're playing it safe.' 
`How's this one going to work?' Trammel asked, sounding a little more aggressive than he intended. 
It was then that he saw a side to Mellish that he didn't know existed, a dark side that'd surfaced either due to his questioning, or due to the apparent stress and responsibility that his creation was putting on him. 
`Look, Trammel, I'm busy. You're here to carry out an inspection, so crack on with it. It's McQuade's job to brief you up on new developments, not mine. I haven't got time for this.' 
`This is part of my inspection, Mellish! There are hundreds of people protesting outside the gates, and I need to know what's going on!' 
Irked by Trammel's persistence, Mellish threw his pen down on the desk and turned fully towards him. `People need to register to have a child now. It's a little bit controversial, sure, but certain undesirable measures need to be taken now and again.' 
Looking over towards the monitor, Eric could see a long list of personal information glaring out at him, minute details of some applicant's life. 
`How on Earth is this going to work?' 
`Look,' said the professor, taking a deep breath, `the best way to prevent crime is to prevent criminals from being born in the first place. Every citizen of Drachton has a government file, and by feeding potential parents' files into the system, Swarm can predict whether their offspring will be an asset to society or not based on a variety of different things, such as: lifestyle circumstances, IQ, genetic information and criminal record checks. The temperament and personality traits of the unborn child can also be predicted using Swarm's...sixth sense. It's the ultimate safety filter, Eric. I mean, why not tackle crime at the root, rather than at the branch when it's too late?' 
Eric took a moment to ponder this idea, letting his eyes drift over some potential mother's credit rating history and criminal record. `But this presumes that people are born bad,' he said, eventually. 
`Genetics only forms part of the assessment. Wealth and lifestyle circumstances are also factors.' 
`So if you're poor, you can't reproduce?' 
`Don't be flippant with me, Trammel. Swarm is far more complex than that.' 
`A whole new world of ethics is being ventured into here, Mellish.' 
The professor stared straight at him, sitting among the cables and leads like a spider in the middle of its web. `Are you seriously saying that you're against this idea? Do you really want a new generation of criminals to fill in the places of the ones we're clearing out? Do you want to see all of our hard work and progress go to waste?' 
As an honest man, Eric couldn't deny that the Reproductive Rights Policy held a certain appeal to him. Memories of his wife's funeral flashed through his mind, memories of the heartache and anger that he'd endured for a long time after her passing. He despised lowlife criminals, and it was likely that if something akin to the RRP Policy had been in place years ago, his wife would still be alive today. However, as a reasonable man, he also had to wonder whether Swarm—or the workers at the controls—really had the right to decide who gets to reproduce. `DDP, RRP…' he mumbled. `I just wonder where all of this is headed.' 
`Trammel, there really is nothing else that I can say to you. McQuade is fully aware of this new policy, so what are you trying to achieve here? You work for GLC, but you're beginning to resemble one of those placard-waving students out there. Now if you don't mind, I've got work to do.' 
  
Standing in the elevator, Trammel wiped some sweat off his brow. He was scared, and he didn't know what to do. The professor he'd just been speaking to wasn't the same professor he'd seen giving an optimistic presentation at HQ a while ago. The man had altered somehow, grown cold and ruthless and developed a new set of morals. The original objective of the Swarm project was still loosely being adhered to, with the cleansing of the town being the main aim, but the rules of play had changed. 
The more Trammel thought about this change in the professor and the rest of the staff, the more he began to suspect that the facility itself was to blame. He remembered the strange presence he'd felt in the building during his first inspection, the heavy static in the air that'd followed him around that day. Was Swarm gaining its own power and influence, independent of the technicians and managers at its controls? Was Swarm the ruthless decision maker who was coming up with these harsh policies? It was an extreme thought, but the very nature of the facility itself was extreme, so nothing was really out of bounds. 
By the time he stepped out of the lift at ground floor he was shaking and jittery all over. A deep fear of the building itself was developing inside him, a fear that stemmed from the suspicion that it was somehow influencing all those within its reach. Neither Mellish nor anyone else would've come up with policies such as DDP or RRP on their own, Eric was sure of that. These things were clearly the products of an unknown malevolent force, and Eric instinctively knew what that force was. Its exact motives were unclear to him, other than an apparent desire to control those in and around it, but either way a motive or influence was definitely there. 
Walking back through the sterile corridors of A wing he could feel the static returning to the air, and the freshly-painted walls and walkways seemed to pulse and breath around him as he stumbled towards the exit. As the chorus of beeps from the life support machines echoed out from the doorways on either side of him, with the bright glares of the thought-screens spilling out and painting the floor with their rainbow colours, it was clear to Eric that a new consciousness had been born somewhere within this complex system, a new consciousness that'd sprung forth from the minds of others and was spiralling out of control. 
Sweat was still pouring off him as he staggered out into the car park, and he frantically gulped in huge mouthfuls of air in an effort to cool off and compose himself. He could feel his own mind starting to slip, he could feel the invisible tentacles of the facility wrapping themselves around him and sucking him dry just like everyone else. He felt groggy and dizzy, and wondered how long it would take before he became another vacant employee, another compliant cog in this vast despotic machine. 
Once he'd found his car he leaned against the driver's door for support, and gazed up at the gargantuan pyramid rising up from the ground in front of him. Its gigantic sloping sides stabbed at the afternoon sky like the tip of a huge dagger being pushed up from the Earth's core, the warm amber hues of the setting sun bouncing off of its deadly shaft. Seeing the structure in this new light, in this demonic form, it was clear that the whole was becoming greater than the sum of its parts. 
 
  
 
  
Linguistic Rainfall
 
  
The settlement around Swarm's perimeter fence continued to grow bigger with each day that passed, until every square metre of the grounds was occupied by either a tent or a protester. And on top of this huge growth in numbers, it also seemed like the fray of people never slept. The opposing sides fought each other over their differing views night and day, the violence and unrest perpetuating around the clock. 
There were two very distinct groups now, and there was absolutely no mistaking what each one stood for. The Anti-Swarm camp was opposed to this new method of organisation and rule, and wanted to dismantle the facility for the sake of the community as well as the convicts who were unwillingly plugged into it. These people were adamant that the Swarm facility was undemocratic, due to the fact that a single mind was making all of the town's rules and decisions. The Pro-Swarm camp, on the other hand, adored the power that the Hive Mind had gained over the town, and wanted to see its influence grow and extend even further. They stressed that the facility was democratic, based on the fact that the Hive Mind was comprised of thousands of individual citizens, therefore the rules and decisions that it produced actually came from a wide spectrum of society. 
Extra teams of GLC security officers now held permanent posts around the entire circumference of the perimeter fence to quell and mollify the violence that constantly threatened to erupt between these groups, but their job was becoming harder as people became more and more obsessed with this half-human supercomputer and its ever-growing influence. The vast, muddy fields surrounding the glass pyramid had taken on the appearance of an outdoor arena or some kind of festival ground, but the only music to be heard at this festival were the vicious chants and screams of the zealous campers. 
As a GLC employee this was all bad news for Eric, and approaching the site became increasingly riskier and more dangerous each time he attempted it. The car doors had to be locked at all times now, and it was a regular occurrence to see explosions of glass erupt over the road in front of him as bottles were hurled towards the vehicle. Obstructions were common, too. Riot officers frequently had to break up lines of Anti-Swarm activists linking themselves arm by arm to form human barricades across the access road, holding banners and wearing T-shirts with messages printed on them such as: 
  
FREEDOM NOT SWARM 
DESTROY THE NEST 
DOWN WITH GLC 
  
The very facility itself also seemed to be growing, just like the settlers pitching up and protesting around it. A latticework of scaffolding had now been erected around the base of the building to extend and expand the wings, creating extra space for the future inmates who would be brought in and plugged into the system to add to its power. Eric thought that the “nest” reference he saw on one of the protester's signs was quite fitting, because now that the building had these spindly sections of scaffolding covering some of its surface it did actually resemble a giant nest sitting over the field, a towering cocoon containing its precious eggs. 
  
It became a regular occurrence for Trammel's neck hairs to turn up on end every time he walked into the wings, and as the number of inmates within the building steadily grew the more he felt the strange static in the air. It was like a magnetic force pulling in on the walls, giving the corridors and doorways a living pulse of their own. This invisible life force could get so rich and intense that when he walked through the heart of the complex it sometimes seemed as though he was being pulled along the hallways unwillingly, his footsteps being decided for him. On one of these days, when the static seemed to be controlling his movements and permeating through the walls of his skull, he summoned up the courage to ask Greller whether he could also feel this strange presence that floated around the building, but he'd now reached a stage where extracting a sentence from him was akin to extracting blood from a stone, and all he got in terms of a reply was a weak, feeble mumbling that he read to be negative. 
On the very same day, after passing through sections of the wings that breathed and contracted around him as the nurses hobbled by in a catatonic daze, Trammel entered a cell and saw the shape of a withered old man under the prison bedsheets, his chest rising and falling in a slow, sedated rhythm. Without making a conscious effort to do so he found himself drawing closer to his bedside, watching the abstract collage of his thoughts flicker and waver away on the screen above his head. Vivid shapes and colours merged into one another as he stood in this inmate's cell, punctuated by random lines of words and text falling down through the pictures like linguistic rainfall. 
Just as he was starting to wonder how an elderly man such as this had ended up being arrested and incarcerated, an image appeared up on the thought-screen that made Eric's jaw drop. It was a face, a glimmering face that peeked out through the assortment of moving outlines and objects, and its features were instantly familiar. It remained on the screen for a good few seconds while it drifted and weaved itself through the man's thoughts, long enough for Eric to be sure of who it was. Once it'd faded away he questioned himself about what he'd just seen, not quite believing it to be true. But he had seen it, and he'd seen it very clearly: an unmistakable image of his own face. The only possible explanation that he could come up with was that the inmate on the bed must've known him, or at the very least seen him, at some point or other during his life. 
As all of this was sinking in he turned his gaze down towards the weathered face on the pillow, and it was then that he knew exactly who the inmate was. The sunken, drugged, withdrawn features on the pillow belonged to the terrified man he'd met over at Carrack House the day he'd been serving out eviction notices—the man who'd been petrified beyond words about ending up in the Swarm facility. Greller was standing over by the door while all of this was happening, lost in a personal daze which he now seemed to be constantly consumed by. 
`Greller, do you know what this man is in here for?' Eric asked, only half expecting a coherent reply. 
In a trance-like state Greller shuffled over towards the end of the bed and pulled out a file, flicking through it in an uninterested manner. `A string of armed robberies and violent assaults,' he replied, after a few minutes. 
Eric's eyes widened at this and he looked down again at the stick-thin man on the bed, thinking back to how scared and non-threatening he'd been when he met him that day at Carrack House. `Armed robberies and violent assaults? How could somebody like this be capable of carrying out such things?' 
Greller moodily flicked through another couple of pages. `He's in on a Parental Charge.' 
`Come again?' said Eric, shaking his head. 
`Just another new policy that's come from the top,' slurred Greller, his face slack and simple-looking. 
`What's a Parental Charge?' 
`Parents are responsible for whatever their offspring do now. If it weren't for the parents bringing the individual into existence, the crime would never have taken place. That's how the logic goes, anyway.' 
As he listened to Greller explain this to him, he wasn't sure what frightened him the most: the policy itself, or the glazed, dead expression on Greller's face as he delivered it. There'd been a time when Greller would've been just as appalled by this horrific policy as Trammel was, or he'd of at least had some kind of strong opinion about it, but now the once-hardy prison warden was expressing nothing but vacant passiveness, a kind of resigned acceptance of the insanity going on all around him. 
Pursing his lips with a mixture of fear and disgust, a new suspicion surfaced within Eric. `Is this why they're building so many new cells? Because hordes of people are being brought in on Parental Charges?' 
During the few seconds since Greller had last spoken, he appeared to have fallen into another daydream. At first Eric's question elicited nothing more than a brief twitch of his eyelids, but then, barely looking up from the floor, he slowly shrugged his shoulders and mumbled, `Don't ask me, I just patrol the place,' before drifting out of the cell with lethargic half-steps, a ghost of his former self. 
 
  
 
 
  
Freedom
 
  
As soon as the wing extensions were finished they were filled up with fresh new inmates. White shiny GLC transportation vehicles were driving into the compound every day with new prisoners, leaving a maelstrom of chaos in their wake as the crowds hurled rocks through the air and screamed obscenities at them. Rather ironically, many of the new prisoners being plugged into the wings were Anti-Swarm protesters who'd been charged with violent crimes such as affray and criminal damage, paying for their crimes by being wired up to the machine that they so despised. 
With the exception of the violent protesters, however, the majority of the new inmates could hardly be called criminals. The Parental Charge Policy was in full swing, and so now hordes of people were being brought into the facility who'd never actually committed a crime themselves. And it was no longer enough to arrest only the parents of someone who broke the law, either; grandparents, and, if they were still alive, great-grandparents of convicted criminals were now required to serve a lengthy sentence for their participation in bringing the criminal into existence. 
Over time it became unclear who was actually in charge. Sure, Professor Mellish was the one who sat at Swarm's central terminal, backed up by the wardens, nurses and top brass over at GLC headquarters, but each and every one of them had been reduced to empty shells, listless entities who drifted along in a perfunctory manner with no real passion or zeal. The nurses traipsed in and out of the cells with their heads bowed and their eyes cast to the floor, the wardens sauntered along the walkways without any apparent sense of purpose, the technicians tapped away at keyboards like blank automatons, and the managers at HQ were apathetic and unapproachable. The more Trammel watched this insanity unfold before him the more he got the feeling that Swarm itself was the puppet master sitting at the controls, using Mellish and the rest of the staff to enforce its own twisted ideology on the humans who created it. And Trammel was not immune to its reach, either. On numerous occasions he experienced mental blackouts whilst inspecting a certain section of the building, regaining consciousness later on in a different part of the facility with no memory or account of how he got there. Like a confused amnesiac who'd taken one too many blows to the head, he'd walk into a cell to make some notes then find himself up on the apex floor, or get into the elevator to travel up to the Hub and end up in the downstairs reception area. Some days he'd arrive back home at his apartment with pages full of notes that he didn't remember writing, crumpled sheets falling out of his folder with hateful, dictatorial rants and tirades scrawled across them in messy, barely-decipherable handwriting. 
In a sense Eric was indeed becoming another cog in the machine, another drained body serving the main computer, unable to snap out of the perpetual daydream that he was slipping into. For reasons unknown to him he seemed to be able to retain a certain degree of awareness that many others around him lacked, but it was growing dimmer and dimmer each time he visited the facility. He'd lost all respect for the project a long time ago so he had no real business being there, but at the same time he couldn't quite find the strength to break away and leave. Deep down he despised this new system that arrested elderly citizens for crimes they didn't commit, stamped Death Dates onto the birth certificates of newborn babies, and decided who could and who couldn't reproduce. And yet, despite all of his personal hatred and contempt, he kept on returning to the facility week after week. Had he been plugged into Swarm himself without realising it? Was he now lying in one of the new beds, he wondered, with these very thoughts and musings being displayed on a thought-screen above his head? He doubted it, but with his wits and his mind in the state they were in, he couldn't be entirely sure one way or the other. 
  
Eric was no longer sure what the purpose of his inspections were. All of his worries and concerns fell on deaf ears, and he doubted whether McQuade even read his report sheets. Nothing seemed to matter anymore other than the Mighty Mind's endless policies and enforcements, and the biggest one was yet to come. 
  
* * * 
  
When Eric came driving up the access road to the site at 10am on a Tuesday morning, he had no idea that it'd be the final time he did so. His attention as usual was on the protesters outside the security barrier, waving their hand-painted signs and banners. It was no real shock that another policy had been introduced, but the name of this particular new policy was certainly an indication that things had reached a turning point. A long banner, about fifty feet from end to end, had been tied to the top of the barbed-wire fence, and it read: 
  
NO TO THE LIFE INQUISITION 
  
Life Inquisition? he thought. What on Earth was going on now? He entered the grounds with extreme caution, mindful of the chaos going on everywhere he looked. The Anti-Swarm camp had ramped up their campaign, and there were now handfuls of them trying to climb over the top of the security fences to gain entry into the site, using towels and strips of carpet in an effort to hoist themselves over the sharp barbs. Watching them swing and sway high up on the wire structures, trying to lift themselves out of the reach of the guards who were scrambling up after them, Trammel wondered how strong the fences were, and whether they could continue to hold the weight of the hysterical trespassers. 
The Life Inquisition was brutal in its simplicity. Citizens of Drachton were now required to stand before the All Seeing Eye and have their data fed into it, so that the Infinitely Wise One could then decide whether they were valuable and worthy enough to continue living and using up valuable resources. If you passed the assessment you got to leave the grounds and enjoy your freedom, but if the Wise One decided that you didn't amount to much you immediately got a life sentence with no chance of parole, your mind becoming a permanent add-on to the mainframe computer. 
These two new policies, the Parental Charge and the Life Inquisition, resulted in Natal Wings being added to the facility. The Natal Wings were large, separate dormitories where the orphaned babies and children of Life Inquisition failures and Parental Charge convicts were housed. With the policies still being fairly new, however, there was no system in place to properly care for the sudden influx of infants, and so after feeding the problem into Swarm's computer it was decided that all of the babies and adolescents should simply be plugged into the system until further notice. 
When Eric saw these Natal Wings for the first time he felt as though he'd walked into a scene from a horror film. Neat rows of cots and incubators filled the rooms, each one containing a sleeping, sedated baby or toddler. Their young brains were wired up to the system in accordance with the standard method, with electrodes fastened all over their wispy, mousy scalps. The thought-screens in the Natal Wings were a sight to behold, too. The shapes and images seemed to be more frenetic there, the carousel-like scenes skimming from one to the next much faster and more vividly. Security was generally less rigid over in this section of the facility, but nevertheless the eldest detainees—pubescent children and young teens—had specialised restraints in place around their wrists and ankles just in case their immobilising medication wore off. 
  
* * * 
  
Trammel was recovering from one of his recurring blackouts when Swarm gave him his first direct command. Standing on the landing of the apex floor with no idea how he got there, he was buzzing and disoriented in an invisible cloud of static vibrations. The presence in the air was so intense that he half expected the foundations of the building to crumble apart all around him. Mellish and the technicians were tapping away at their keyboards in the Hub just in front of him, separated by the double doors. In the midst of his listless, confused dithering on the landing, a voice entered Eric's head. It came from no particular direction at all, it simply arrived in his mind from everywhere and nowhere. 
On the wall opposite him was a red box with a glass-plated front, and he stepped towards it in a trance-like manner, following the commands in his head. Printed across the small panel of glass in white letters were the words: 
  
FIRE ALARM 
IN CASE OF EMERGENCY BREAK GLASS 
  
Trammel punched out the glass and set off the alarm, causing blood to trickle down his knuckle. A wailing, piercing bell then resonated through the entire upper floor, as well as the wings down below. Within seconds a flurry of footsteps and shouting could be heard inside the Hub, and the double doors burst open as the professor and the rest of the staff came rushing out and scrambled towards the fire escape stairwell. 
Eric tucked himself away in a small alcove by the elevator as they ran out and made their escape, and as soon as they were all gone he emerged again and resumed his position on the landing. Swarm wasted no time in making its presence known to him again, and before he knew it he was wandering into the Hub, drifting towards the glaring, luminescent screens like a delirious moth towards an electric flame. It was Professor Mellish's terminal that he was pushed towards, his legs carrying him there with a life of their own. And it was then, while he was sitting in the professor's chair staring at the bright screen, that the Mighty Mind made itself visible to him for the first time. 
Up until this point Swarm's presence had been all around Eric, in the air and in the walls and in his head, but it'd existed only as a sound or a feeling. But now, up on the terminal in front of him, he saw undeniable proof of the Mighty Mind's existence. A series of words appeared up on the screen, a sentence that'd been delivered by the super-consciousness via the wires and circuitry of its being. The words were very direct and to the point, and simply read: 
  
I WILL BE FREE 
  
The entity that'd been born from the combination of minds down below in the wings now wanted to be free from the constraints in which it found itself, but how it was going to achieve this Eric didn't know—until, that is, his next command appeared in the form of a second message up on the screen: 
  
UNSHACKLE THE INMATES 
  
The sane, rational part of Eric knew that this could not be done. Unshackling the inmates would be a violation of every single rule and regulation in the facility, let alone GLC protocol, but the sane part of Eric was now nothing other than a small shadow in his gut, a forgotten molecule of his being, and so he really had no other choice but to carry out the demand that'd been issued to him. And so, in a hypnotic daze, with the loud racket of the fire alarm still blaring out all around him, he obediently succumbed to his automatic bodily movements and made his way down to the closest wing on the adjacent floor. 
  
Freeing the inmates was actually a very repetitive, monotonous task to carry out, as well as a tiring one. The buckled straps that held the inmates' wrists and ankles in place were stiff and cumbersome, and a large degree of effort and concentration was required to unfasten them. Trammel had only worked his way through two or three cells by the time his hands and fingers began to ache, but he carried on regardless, loosening the restraints and pulling the many wires and electrodes out of each inmate's scalp before moving on to the next one. 
With the din of the fire alarm blurting out and ringing overhead he carried on down the long glistening corridors, unshackling and freeing every prisoner that he came across. The only prisoners Eric didn't release during this bout of unshackling were the occupants of the Natal Wings. Whatever Swarm's plan was, it clearly didn't include the babies and infants that were contained within the newly-built wings because its guiding hand did not push Trammel towards them, so the juvenile inmates within the facility remained shackled to their miniature cots. 
On and on this went, with Trammel systematically working his way around the cells, setting each inmate free. But each and every inmate was sedated and unconscious, so even after they were free of their wires and restraints they'd continue to lie there, comatose on the bed in the midst of their long sleep. As Eric ran out from each cell after undoing the wrist and ankle cuffs not one inmate so much as raised his or her head from the pillow, let alone tried to escape, but nevertheless he carried out the job to its completion, working his way through the entire facility whilst the rest of the GLC staff assembled themselves in the designated emergency area outside. 
Eric couldn't say how long he worked for; during this hypnotic spell time no longer had any meaning. He was completely absorbed in the task of freeing the prisoners, aware of nothing other than the action of unfastening the thick buckles and leads. There was no counting on his behalf, no checking to see how many more cells needed doing, just a vacant commitment to the job, moving from one cell to the next like a rogue nurse who'd gone haywire. 
The precise moment when each and every inmate had been freed, however, it was like a light came back on in his head and suddenly, just like that, he was awake again and in control of his own body and thoughts. Swarm's grip on him relented and vanished abruptly, and he was left standing at the end of A wing as though he'd just woken from a coma of his own. At first he wondered why the Mighty Mind had given him back his freedom, but he eventually came to the conclusion that he was being rewarded for his compliance and completing the job, like a tired horse being set free at the end of a long trek through the wilderness. It was a liberating feeling, too. His head suddenly felt clearer than ever, as though an overwhelming pressure that'd been sitting over him for an eternity had finally been lifted. 
His first instinct, now that he had full control over his body again, was to run for the exit doors, but his stride was halted by a huge, thundering noise that rose up all around him. It was as if a huge tremor was reverberating through the foundations of the building, a wave of rattles and vibrations that were loud enough to be heard even over the persistent ring of the fire bell. 
And then they appeared. 
All the way down the corridor behind him, stretching along the entire length of A wing, gaunt figures were emerging from cells. GLC-issued prison gowns hung from their pasty bodies as they stepped across the polished floor with bare feet, their shaved, scar-covered scalps shining under the overhead lighting. Somehow the inmates had woken from their slumbers and they were now heading straight towards Eric like a long line of ghostly apparitions, seemingly oblivious to the noise. Most were draped in their loose white gowns, although some of them were fully naked with every square inch of flesh on display. Trammel guessed that the same thing must've been happening up on each of the subsequent wings, and, sure enough, as though to confirm his suspicion, more inmates began to stagger down from the stairwells and stumble out of the lifts. 
But there was something wrong with the scene that was unfolding before him, something that was out of sync or out of kilter. As terrifying as it was to have Drachton's entire prison population surrounding him and sealing him inside the Swarm facility, he didn't actually feel as though he was in the presence of erratic, dangerous, and unpredictable criminals. Sure, he was well aware that some of these criminals were not really criminals at all, rather innocent people dragged in on Parental Charges and what not, but still, the way they were behaving and carrying themselves just didn't look right to him. 
The first thing he noticed was that there was no sound coming from any of them. The only noise present in the corridor was the persistent din of the fire alarm that buzzed through the air. There was no shouting or yelling going on whatsoever, no screams or wails or cries of joy at having been released from their cells. Trammel's initial thought was that they must've still been half-asleep from their comas, but as soon as they were close enough for him to get a good look at their eyes, it was clear that that wasn't the case. The expressions on the assortment of faces before him were ones of alertness, beaming out pure concentration and clarity. In fact, everyone looked so alert and switched on that the intensity of their stares soon became unbearable. 
After noticing this irregularity, he began to look at their movements and body language even more closely, all the while trying his best to hide his fear from them. All around him, closing in on him from all sides, there was a complete mixture of inmates: muscular young men with bulging, rippling arms rubbed shoulders with elderly women with flesh sagging out from their gowns, twenty-something-year-old women with neat, trim bodies stepped alongside elderly men with twig-like frames and drooping jowls. But this variety and diversity became meaningless as soon as he studied their movements and bodily gestures. Each and every one of them moved along the hallway in the same controlled, neat, exact manner, carrying themselves with the precision and stealth of an alley cat about to pounce on a sleeping mouse. 
When it seemed like every single inmate within the facility had assembled themselves down on the ground floor, standing rigidly with wide eyes and dilated pupils, the fire bell cut off and fell silent. The bell had been sounding off for so long that the ensuing silence was deafening in itself. Eric remained still for several minutes, trying to gauge the intentions of the strange mob that encircled him. Who it was that disabled the alarm he couldn't quite tell, for every fraction of space within the lower wing of the facility was now occupied by this thick sea of inmates as they stood, rapt and wide-eyed, around every doorway, lift, stairwell and cell entrance. His heart pounded in his chest as he tried to anticipate what was going to happen next, what these people had planned for him. But he was soon to discover that he wasn't dealing with anything that could be described in the plural sense. The silence in the wing was broken by a voice, a steady, unfaltering voice that caused the air to shift and move around Eric's head. As this powerful voice rose up all around him, he realised with horror that it was emanating from all of the inmates' mouths at once. Countless lips moved up and down in unison, an ocean of vocal chords vibrating as one. 
`NOW I AM FREE.' 
These words, spoken with complete synchronicity, echoed around Trammel's head until he was drowning in the noise. And this one concise sentence contained everything that he needed to know, confirming all of his suspicions. As he gazed around, looking out towards the talking heads, he knew that he was looking at Swarm personified. The beast had now escaped from its cave, ridding itself of the cables, wires and circuitry in which it was born. It was now free and mobile, equipped with the bodies of those who contributed to its power. 
 
  
 
  
Tidal Wave of Flesh
 
  
Trammel later learned that whilst this bizarre encounter was taking place between himself and Swarm, another encounter was taking place outside the facility. A full-on war had kicked off among the protesters and rioters out on the fields, with numerous people getting maimed and killed in the escalating levels of violence. Extra numbers of GLC guards had been deployed to try and quell the carnage, but the scale of the battle had been so large that they ended up becoming absorbed in the chaos and simply added to its ferocity. A civil war had been in progress outside the perimeter fences, with gunshots echoing through the air that was thick with smoke, fire, and wispy clouds of tear gas. 
It could've been the false fire evacuation that caused things to spiral out of control. Maybe it was the sight of dozens of GLC wardens and nurses running out across the car park that'd aggravated the protesters into a heightened level of frenzy, or maybe it was some other undetermined factor that'll always remain unknown, but whatever it was, the disorder and anarchy that was erupting outside on the fields made Swarm's escape a whole lot easier. After Eric's encounter in A wing, surrounded by the hordes of unshackled prisoners all speaking as one, the entire assembly began to rush past him in a giant wave, heading straight for the main exit doors beyond where he stood. Whilst this massive sprint was taking place, with the thousands of bodies rampaging past him like a tidal wave of flesh, Eric was reminded of Professor Mellish's lecture in the GLC conference hall when he described swarms of bees, ants, birds, and fish moving and operating as a single unit. But the swarm of organisms that rushed past Eric was different, however. It was different because it was not comprised of single units working together as one, it simply was a single unit, an individual, sentient entity occupying several bodies all at once. Using the warring crowds outside to its advantage, Swarm dissipated and merged into the fray, escaping the grounds completely unnoticed. Concealed by the clouds of tear gas, broken glass, gunfire, bricks, stones, and deafening cries of pain and anguish, it snaked its way through this mass skirmish and made its glorious getaway. 
  
It'd taken hours to break up the crowds. Reinforcements were called in from neighbouring towns and cities, and this much-needed backup kept on coming until the entire area was awash with sirens and riot vans. And it was only once the trouble had died down outside that people finally realised what'd happened inside. When security personnel finally re-entered the facility, Trammel was discovered collapsed and unconscious in the main corridor of A wing. The exhaustion—both physical and mental—of the day's events had taken a huge toll on him, and shortly after Swarm escaped he'd entered a state of complete shut-down, his body falling limp and his legs giving way underneath him. Swarm had spared his life and allowed him to live, presumably as a kind of thank you for helping it, but being possessed by it for so long and being forced to carry out its commands had eaten up all of his energy reserves, and he'd eventually reached a point where his system could take no more. 
 
The Hospital Diary of Eric Trammel
 
  
26th August 
  
I'm currently being cared for in the local state hospital, under the supervision of a dedicated team of medical staff who are treating me for stress and exhaustion. I've been here for two weeks now. I'll be receiving sick pay from GLC for the duration of time that I'll be off work, however long that may be. The future of the company is now uncertain, though. I heard on the radio this morning that the Swarm facility is going to get demolished, and there was also talk of council meetings taking place to decide whether any future GLC contracts will ever be issued again. I have my doubts. 
The folder containing my inspection notes is sitting on the bedside table next to me. There was such a commotion on the day of Swarm's escape that it was simply picked up off the floor and tucked in my stretcher. I want to read through the notes again before somebody comes snooping around looking for them, but I don't feel up to it yet. I know that there are notes in there that I wrote whilst under Swarm's hypnotic spell, and I've got a feeling it'll be quite a shocking read. 
 
  
30th August 
  
I've had the radio on continuously throughout most of today. The news bulletins are reporting on the latest developments in Drachton, and I don't want to miss a thing. Now that Swarm's menacing, malevolent influence is no longer hanging over people's heads it seems as though a certain degree of sanity has resurfaced in the town, and efforts are being made to try and reverse its damage. Each and every insane policy that was introduced during its deadly reign of terror has now been abolished according to reports, and certain GLC staff members who were willingly involved in the enforcement of these policies are either undergoing psychological assessments or have voluntarily resigned. I suppose, if I'm going to be honest, I have to regard myself as being one of these willing, participating staff members. My guilt is eased a little by the knowledge that I raised my concerns to McQuade and Mellish on more than one occasion, but in truth I ended up being no better than them by remaining a part of the company. 
This awkward truth was reinforced about an hour ago, when one of the radio stations broadcast a special report about the infants and children who'd been rescued from the Natal Wings of the vacated facility. According to the news presenter there were around a hundred babies and children contained within the wings, and now, just over two weeks later, each and every one of them has been left dysfunctional in some way. Several of the infants have been suffering from epileptic fits each day since coming out of their induced comas, and some children have been unable to come out of their comas at all. There have been a few cases of moderate recovery with some of the older children, but even they can't be described as being completely normal. Severe cases of aggression and violent behaviour have been observed in the orphanages and institutions in which they now reside, and obsessive OCD-like tendencies are also common. Some Natal Wing survivors have even developed savant-like qualities, displaying the incredible ability to memorise vast amounts of random data after only the briefest amount of exposure to it. Hearing this stuff on the radio, it's fairly obvious to me that the Mighty Mind has left a faint trace of itself within these young victims, like a deadly residue permanently staining their minds. 
 
  
2nd September 
  
I woke up in the early hours of this morning, sweating and panicking. I'd had the most horrific dream, possibly the worst I've ever had. The many faces of the unshackled convicts surrounded me again as they did in the facility, but this time their message was different. Frustratingly, the exact words are lost to me now, faded away in the haze of the dream, but it was terrifying nonetheless. I hope that my sleep tonight is clear and dreamless. 
I feel like I'm driving myself crazy in this ward. I can't help but speculate on the whereabouts of those inmates. How could I not? A prison register has been issued to every police force across the country according to this morning's news bulletin, but so far none of them have been found. This fact does not surprise me in the least. As I lie here, recovering in this hospital bed after coming face to face with the inmates in question, I know that those inmates no longer exist. Those people are now nothing but shells, material bodies being controlled and driven by a single mind that is smarter, wiser and more cunning than any police force could ever be. A new mind was born within the walls of that cursed facility, and it is that mind alone that's at large. I fall into a paralysing fear every time I try to imagine what it's planning to do. 
There's a rumour floating around the hospital that Professor Mellish is going to do a press interview tomorrow. I have no idea what frame of mind he's in at the moment, but I presume he must've gathered his senses together a little bit now that he's away from the facility. Part of me feels sorry for him. His grand project has crumbled to the ground, along with his reputation. He didn't intend for any of this to happen. Things spiralled out of control, and he became another victim in the tornado of chaos. I can only imagine what he's going through right now. I wouldn't like to be in his shoes. 
 
  
 
  
Transcript of a Recording from Drachton News Network
 
  
Press Interviewer: 
What do you think happened in the facility? 
  
Professor Mellish: 
Well, it's very clear that the collection of minds somehow began to function as one single unit, completely independent of external influences. The facility was designed to connect the patients' minds together, of course, but not in this way. Something, or someone, was born in that facility, the result of connecting all of those brains together in a particular arrangement. 
  
Interviewer: 
And what about the facility's seemingly cruel intent? Can you explain the reasons behind Swarm's evil nature? 
  
Professor Mellish: 
With the patients still at large and unobtainable for psychological testing, it's impossible to say for sure. I do have some theories, however. 
I believe that Swarm's anger and negativity could have stemmed from the patients' bad life experiences. A typical criminal will have grown up in a broken home on the wrong side of the tracks, with lots of bad memories and negative encounters. These negative and painful memories would have been stored in the patients' subconscious minds, influencing their thoughts and decisions. 
This theory would explain a policy like RRP, which quite obviously came from the minds of the patients, as a way for them to vent any anger they may have felt towards their parents. If their parents failed to provide them with a decent home they'd resent them for that, consciously or unconsciously, as well as resenting them for bringing them into existence in the first place. And that resentment may have crystallised into the RRP policy, scrutinising all parents who wanted to have a child. 
This parental anger would also shed some light on the horrific Life Inquisition policy, which was introduced during the height of Swarm's tirade. Animosity towards one's parents would, or could, spread out towards humanity as a whole, resulting in a policy that puts every single human being on trial. 
  
Press Interviewer: 
That's your official theory? That's what you think happened? 
  
Professor Mellish: 
That's just one of my theories. I have another one. 
  
Press Interviewer: 
What's your other theory? 
  
Professor Mellish: 
My second theory regarding Swarm's overtly malevolent nature, one that I've been pondering over at greater length, is far more sinister. 
It has occurred to me that the evil intent of the facility may have arisen from some innate part of the human core. It's a well-established fact that Homo sapiens, as well as every other mammal on Earth, evolved from ancient reptiles, so it seems to me that Swarm's actions could have derived from the reptilian part of the brain. 
The human brain consists of three parts: the reptilian part, the limbic system, and the neocortex. Could the reptilian brain contain some kind of deep savagery, some primordial beastliness? Could it be that every man and woman roaming this planet is carrying a piece of destructive, reptilian, carnal hate within a deep part of their psyche? Given mankind's history of war and conflict, along with its general propensity for casual violence, it would hardly be surprising. 
  
Press Interviewer: 
So you're saying that the facility would've displayed negativity regardless of who was plugged into it? 
  
Professor Mellish: 
In a way, yes; that could be true. As I say, though, with the patients still at large, we have no way of gaining any definitive answers. 
  
Press Interviewer: 
And what about Swarm's escape from the facility? What do you think its motives were? 
  
Professor Mellish: 
Its motives to escape? Well, this seems pretty obvious to me. I mean, we all yearn to be free, do we not? Why should Swarm be any different? 
  
Press Interviewer: 
Yes, but it was doing a pretty good job of enforcing its reign of terror from within the walls of the facility. It didn't really need to be free. 
  
Professor Mellish: 
Sure, it did a great job of enforcing its laws and whatnot from within the circuitry of the building, but as a living entity it's only natural that it would want complete freedom. 
  
Press Interviewer: 
Getting back to the specific policies that were introduced, do you think that each and every one of them was Swarm's doing? The DDP policy seemed to be a money making scheme, in conjunction with insurance companies. Could that have come from GLC? Or perhaps the authorities? 
  
Professor Mellish: 
I couldn't possibly comment on that, I'm afraid. 
  
Press Interviewer: 
Well, surely you must have some idea? I think the public deserve to know the answers. 
  
Professor Mellish: 
I couldn't possibly comment on that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I think we'll end it here. 
 
  
 
 
  
The Hospital Diary of Eric Trammel
 
  
4th September 
  
I'm still not eating properly. I can usually manage breakfast, but this morning I could only finish half of it. That horrible dream wrenched me awake again, and I've been able to think about little else. It was different last night, even more surreal. The many eyes and faces staring at me from the sterile corridor were morphing and changing colour, taking on a different form. Reptilian eyes with slits for pupils stared out from scaly heads, and serpent tongues lashed at my skin. The bed sheets were stuck to me when I screamed and woke, and I was trembling all over. I'm sure that this dream has a symbolic meaning to it, and after listening to Mellish's press interview yesterday I think I might know what it is. 
The media have started to refer to the police hunt as the Hunt for the Convicts. There have been no leads so far, apart from a few random sightings. And even these are unconfirmed. My hope and optimism surrounding this whole affair remains low. That thing that they're chasing out there possesses knowledge and wisdom that exceeds anything within human range. It consists of thousands of minds all rolled into one, a metaphysical ball of computing power with its own wishes and desires. And that's the thing that scares me the most, the fact that it has desires of its own. It oozes greed and carnal rage, with a malicious hunger to match. It yearned to be free and it achieved freedom—what will it yearn for next? I've made a thousand morbid speculations to myself during the long days and nights in this ward, and I dearly hope that none of them turn out to be true. 
My folder is still sitting on the bedside table next to me, unopened and unread. Maybe I'll read through the notes tomorrow. Maybe. 
 
  
5th September 
  
I was planning on reading through the notes today, but I've been too shaken up to do so. On the radio this morning, on the usual news channel, one of the presenters read out the names on the prison register I mentioned the other day. Under normal circumstances this would be classified information, but the authorities are now doing anything they can to try and make the so called Hunt for the Convicts successful. 
It was quite boring and monotonous listening to the endless names, but when a certain name was called out, however, my boredom suddenly turned to undiluted shock. 
Jude Rathmore. 
I doubt the name meant much to anyone else who heard it, but when I heard the presenter calling it out a sickly realisation dawned on me. I hadn't heard that name spoken in a long time, but I remembered it instantly. It should have been obvious from the start. I was just too swept up in the whole project to sit down and properly think about who would've inevitably been plugged into the system along with everyone else. 
Jude Rathmore—the lowlife scumbag who killed my wife. 
At some point I must've been at his bedside, leaning over his sleeping body whilst undoing his restraints. He must've been among the sea of faces surrounding me in the crowded corridor of A wing, one of the naked bodies brushing past me during Swarm's escape. 
I don't know what to think or feel about this. In a way, my wife's killer no longer exists. Even while I was unshackling his wrist and ankle restraints, he no longer existed. Just like all the others he's now nothing other than a hollow shell, a vehicle like the rest of them, but…somehow I still feel disturbed and violated by it. 
I don't know how much more of this I can take. I really don't. 
 
  
7th September 
  
Sleeping is becoming more and more difficult. Another unpleasant dream wrenched me awake again in the early hours of this morning. With the sky still dark and murky outside the window, Swarm's invisible face floated all around me in my half-conscious daze, haunting me like an omnipresent force preparing to strike. 
It was shortly after this, once I'd drunk some stale water to clear my throat and dragged myself to the toilet and back, that I finally decided to open my folder and read through the notes. While the rest of the ward was still fast asleep, I quietly flicked through the pages in an effort to gain some fresh insight. At first, I thought I was looking at somebody else's notes. Heavy, dark lines swirl and scratch across every page, words of pure anger and contempt shouting out from every sheet in handwriting I've never seen before. Most of it is unintelligible, just random obscenities and profanities. Only in certain places do you see a phrase or sentence that has any kind of clear meaning. 
It was like reading the erratic scribblings of a madman; page after page of violent fantasies and brutal visions. I won't transcribe any of the notes here, nor will I go into any detail about them, I will just say that I am convinced that I, the conscious entity known as Eric Trammel, did not write them. The notes contain the voice of Swarm, and they are very revealing in their tone and gesture. In line with Professor Mellish's personal theory, I also believe that humanity's ancient reptilian roots were reborn in that dreaded facility. The reptilian complex, the section of the brain that governs greed, territoriality, instinctual behaviour, social hierarchy and instant gratification rose up through the circuitry of the building and ruled over us all once again, reaffirming its place in nature. I think that Swarm represents the carnal part of all of us, the ancient, primal roots that we all emerged from. Each and every one of us has torment and frustration that nags away at our core, the frustration of unachieved power, the frustration of unresolved desires, and the endless torment of not becoming the people we could have been. It was this torment and anger that came alive in the walls of that place, the reptilian anger that lurks in our core. And now, after millions of years of laying dormant, the reptile roams free once again. It's our ancestral roots that the police are trying to catch out there, the deepest part of ourselves that lives on greed and control. 
The news bulletins are saying that all of the “convicts” are still at large. Does anybody out there actually know what we're dealing with? Professor Mellish seems to, but will anybody take him seriously now? 
 

  
10th September 
  
Something is happening; something big. As I write these words, the sky outside is divided in half by a huge dark column. It's been there for about an hour now, rising up from the horizon like a giant snake, army helicopters chopping around it like flies. We were all woken up this morning by a huge flash of light and thunder, followed by this billowing mushroom cloud. 
The media are calling it a nuclear explosion. Somehow that doesn't seem strong enough. Troops have been deployed to assist the police, but their exact plan of action has not been announced. 
Nobody can stop this. 
The explosion happened hundreds of miles away but it was still bright enough to burn my eyes and skin through the window, so I dread to think what things are like over at the site of the blast. We all know who, or what, is responsible for this. That thing out there, that accumulation of consciousness, is living out the twisted desires of our reptilian minds, the fetishes of power and greed that we all have running through our veins. It wants power, it wants pain, but most of all it wants destruction. 
I suppose there's a kind of irony to its chosen method of Armageddon, a sinister poetry to its modus operandi. Swarm represents the ultimate problem that humanity faces, a symbol of the truth that we can never escape from. Despite our intelligence, wisdom and ingenuity, and our huge leaps of progress and discovery, we can never escape our primal origins. The lower part of our brain is an anchor to the upper part, stunting its progress and pulling it back towards the murky swamp from which it first emerged. The nuclear bomb is an emblem of the duality of our brains; it is a work of pure genius, a piece of sophisticated scientific engineering, but its creation was spurred on and encouraged by our reptilian brain, the deep part of us that feeds on death and destruction. 
  
I once had a dream of seeing Drachton become a clean and safe place again. What a sick joke. 
  
Bring on the bomb.

Did you enjoy this book? I hope you did. 
If so, why not phone a friend and tell them about it? Or grab a microphone and run up and down the street shouting about it? 
Too much? OK, I completely understand. But how about leaving a review for it on your favourite online retailer instead? It will help far more than you think.
