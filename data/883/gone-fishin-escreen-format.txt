Introduction to EScreen

EScreen is a unique form of book style. It is written as a modified screen play format so as to accommodate electronic reading devices. 
Why should you read a book written in EScreen format?
It is a movie using your mind as its screen. It allows the reader’s imagination to soar much as old time radio shows once did. It allows you become more a part of the story rather than merely an observer.  An entertaining story can be read in a short time rather than the traditional book which often requires many hours. It is entertainment that can easily be spliced into today’s fast paced life style no matter how demanding your schedule might be.

Chapter 1
Country “Livin’”




FADE IN:

Int. A church - sunday morning.

The CHOIR is just finishing the final lines of the Lord's Prayer. The volume increases as the singing concludes.

Choir 
(singing)
Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

The PRIEST is seated as the choir ends. He stands, walks to the pulpit, stands solemnly peering into the mass of seated parishioners and begins the sermon. His voice echos loudly throughout the church.  

Priest
Romans 12:17-21 Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all. If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all. Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God

The Priest's voice begins to fade as he speaks the following lines.

PRIEST (cont'd) 
For it is written, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord." 

JACK and his wife a couple in their early sixties are seated in the front pew as the priest speaks. They appear with hands folded and highly attentive, hanging on every word.

DISSOLVE TO:

Ext. The church doorway - after the service

The priest is standing at the doorway speaking to the parishioners as they leave. Jack and his wife are next in line.

JACK
Thank you Father. Your message was truly inspirational. If only we could all live by those words.

PRIEST
Thank you Jack but those are not my words, they are the words of God. I merely pass them on to those who are willing to receive them and act accordingly. The peace of the Lord be with both of you.

Cut to:

INT. BEAT UP 92 PONTIAC - EARLY AFTERNOON 

Jack is in the passenger's seat while his friend PETEY a balding, portly 68 year old is driving. They are driving along a country road bordered by woods and farm land. Flashing red and blue lights suddenly illuminate the rear view mirror. 

PETEY
Hey, Jack what's that cop want? He's right on our ass.

Jack turns in his seat to look out the rear window.

JACK 
(Anxiously)
How should I know? Better pull over!

They pull over and wait nervously for the COP to approach. The cop car pulls up behind them. After a few seconds the cop exits his car and walks up to Petey's car. He stops momentarily and looks at the large box protruding from the trunk of the car. He then continues to the driver's window.

COP
How are you gentleman doing today?

PETEY
What's the problem officer?

COP
What's in the box in your trunk?

Jack stares straight ahead in sweaty silence. After a second or two he turns towards the cop and struggles to appear less anxious than he is.

PETEY
It's a television! We're takin' it up to a friend.

COP
Television, huh? In a box that big?

JACK
It's an old one. 

The cop turns and walks to the back of the car. Looks over the box and returns to speak again with 
Petey.

COP 
(in an interrogating tone) 
Just where exactly are you taking it?

PETEY
We're takin' it to Larry up at 'Larry’s Fishin' Hole' a couple miles up the road.
Immediately the cop strikes a less threatening pose and tone. He smiles.

COP
Oh, you mean Larry Fine. Known him for years. I take my kids up there fishing now and then. (a beat) 
Anyway, the reason I stopped you is you can't have that box hanging outta the trunk like that without a flag on it. A piece of cloth will do it. A red piece would be the best.

The cop looks at the clutter in the back seat of Petey's car and points to an old shirt lying on the back.

COP (COnT'd)
That plaid shirt there. You can use that. 

Jack reaches back for the shirt as the cop begins to leave.

COP (CONT'D) 
That's about it boys and by the way tell Larry that Tim Harbor was asking about him. Have a good day.

The cop gets into his car and drives away. Jack expels a sigh of relief. Jack gets out of the car and puts the shirt on the protruding box. He reenters the car and they drive away.

JACK
Man that was a close one.

PETEY
What do you mean?

Jack hesitates and then speaks rather unconvincingly.

JACK
You don't have the money for a fucking ticket do you?

PETEY
Oh, yeah, I know what you mean. Yeah that was a close one.

DISSOLVE TO:

A sign appears in the distance The sign reads - 'Sorry - No fish are bitin' today - Closed for Repairs'. They turn and drive down the long, dirt lane adjacent to the sign. A dust cloud pours from the rear of the car as they drive. It is Sticksville for sure.

EXT. Larry’s HOUSE - MID MORNING

LARRY with a long scraggy, white pony tail, a beard, and some missing teeth. He's got tats on both arms - "Nam 68" and "Khe Sanh" and a huge scar on his cheek. He is sitting in a rocker on his dilapidated porch. He is wearing faded blue jeans and flannel shirt. His large, shaggy, mongrel dog Rusty is lying next to him. He is slowly rocking back and forth as the car approaches. He continues to rock even as Jack and Petey get out of the car.

Larry
You got it here alright I see.

Petey
Hope it's gonna work okay after that ride down your road there.

LARRY 
(Grinning broadly)
Oh, it's gonna work just fine I'm sure.

Petey goes to the the trunk and he starts to untie the box.

JACK
No, leave 'em on.

PETEY
Well, how are we gonna get it out of the trunk and into the house if we don't untie it?

LARRY
You didn't tell 'em Jack?

JACK
No, I didn't.

LARRY
(laughing)
Guess ya wanta make is a surprise, huh?

JACK
Petey, we gotta drive down to the pond.

LARRY
No, wait a minute. We can't just throw it in there. We gotta do some preparin' first.

JACK
What do ya mean?

LARRY
Pull around the back by the garage.

Petey gives Jack a surprised look and get back into the car. Jack follows Larry on foot to the garage.

Ext. LARRY'S garage - minutes later

The garage is an old, partially, dilapidated building with swing open doors. Larry opens the garage. The walls are aligned with old car parts, rusty tools and scrap lumber. In the middle stands a large, commercial style, meat grinding machine.

JACK
What's that?

LARRY
A meat grinder.

PETEY
What's it for?

LARRY
Get the box outta the trunk and I'm gonna show ya.

JACK
(with a look of realization)
Holy shit!

LARRY
Ya didn't think we were gonna just throw him in the pond in one piece did ya? I mean my guys a pretty good at eatin' stuff but they're not piranhas. If we don't cut him up it'll take days. If we do it'll be minutes.

Petey walks to the trunk and starts to untie the box.

JACK
Is this thing going to handle bones and all?

LARRY
Ya gotta quarter up the leg ones first and then it'll do 'em just fine.

JACK
How do you know?

LARRY
Cause I done it. Let me tell ya how I got this thing in the first place. I usta have a huntin' buddy, Ralph. We always got a couple of deer every season and sometimes inbetween seasons too, if ya know what I mean. Anyway, Ralph was really into making venison sausage so he bought this grinder here. Then about ten years ago the price of the liver that I usta feed the fish with went sky high. So what I did, was after we dressed out our deer I took the guts from 'em and ran 'em through the grinder. Made perfect fish food for free.

JACK
But the deer guts didn't have bones did they?

LARRY
No, but I usta run the feet and the left over bones through too and they went just fine.

JACK
You said it was your buddy Ralph's machine. How come you got it?

LARRY
Ralph, he hasn't hunted in five years now. He can't no more.

JACK
How so?

LARRY
It seems that poor Ralph was using the grinder and he got his hand caught. It took off all of his fingers includin' his trigger finger. After that happened he didn't want no part of this machine and I got it.

Petey has untied the box and dragged it into the garage. Jack untapes the box and opens it exposing the body. Petey flinches back at the sight. Larry goes to the back of the garage and returns with a yellow rain slicker, a shower cap, a scuba mask and a small electric chain saw. He takes a sheet of plywood which was standing against the wall and lays it on the ground in front of the grinder. He points to the body in the box and the plywood.

LARRY
Strip him down, put him here and stand back.

PETEY
(anxiously)
Did you ever do this before? To a human being I mean?

LARRY
(calmly)
Can't say as I have. 
(a beat)

Larry looks up at Petey and smiles.

LARRY (CONT'D)
Ya know what they though, - the first time is always the best!

Jack puts the body on the plywood and strips it. Larry then puts on the slicker, mask and cap, starts the saw and begins to dismember the body. After removing one of the arms he points to a pile of plastic leaf bags and calls to jack.

LARRY (COnT'D)
Grab one of the bags, put it under the machine and run this through.

Larry holds up the arm for Jack to take. Jack hesitates.

LARRY (CONT'D)
Come on man! You didn't think it was all on me did ya?

Jack timidly starts the grinder and follows Larry's commands.

DISSOLVE TO:

Larry and Jack have finished grinding the body. It is all in the plastic bag. Larry has the blood covered plywood sheet leaning against the garage door with his slicker, cap and mask lying next to it. He is washing everything down with a hose. Petey has just finished vomiting at the side of the garage. Larry speaks to Petey. 

LARRY 
(grinning) 
Now that wasn't so bad, was it?

PETEY 
(With vomit dripping from his chin)
Wasn't so bad! It was fuckin' awful!

LARRY
Tie up the bag so he doesn't ooze out on the way.

Larry points to a wheelbarrow and shovel leaning against the side of the garage.

LARRY
Get the wheelbarrow and the shovel.

Larry points to a can next to the garage wall.

LARRY (CONT'D)
Oh yeah! And the kerosene can too.

Petey obliges and they together lift the plastic bag into the wheelbarrow.

LARRY
Get his clothes and put 'em on top.

Petey gathers the pile of the dead man's clothes and puts them on top of the bag in the wheelbarrow.

LARRY 
(grinning)
Okay, let's get down there. It's already passed their lunchtime.

EXT. LARRY'S FISH POND - minutes later

Larry cuts the bag open to reveal the red, pulpy mass it contains. He throws the first shovel full into the pond.  The fish swarm voraciously devouring the pieces.

TIME CUT:

Larry has thrown the final portion of the body's remains into the pond and is now washing the last pieces from the bag.

LARRY
Throw his clothes in that barrel over there.
Larry points to an old, rusty burning barrel.

LARRY (CONT'D) 
I wanta burn the clothes. We don't wanta have any trace of him left - not so much as a fart.

Jack tosses the pile of the man's clothes into the barrel and larry pours some kerosene on them and sets them ablaze. The three men stand silently as flames leap from the barrel. 

JACK
Do you think that will get rid of everything for sure?

LARRY
No worryin'. If anything got spilled the rats will take care of it pronto.

Chapter 2
Before the fall



FADE OUT

INT. JACK'S OFFICE AT work (TYRON) - EARLY EVENING

Jack is seated at his desk laboriously working. Suddenly the door opens and MARK a coworker appears.

MARK
Don't you ever go home?

JACK
Gotta finish this up. Why are you here?

MARK
I left early and forgot my phone. Hadda come back for it. You know there's no time and a half here don't ya?

JACK
Yeah, I know.

MARK
A day's work for a day's pay - not a day and a half's work for a day's pay.

JACK
I guess I'm just a company man. Always have been. Can't help myself, that's the way I was raised.

MARK 
(laughing) 
So you're blaming your mother for you're being stupid.

JACK 
(laughing)
Gotta blame somebody.

Jack turns back to his work as Mark leaves.

MARK
Well, have a good night. See ya tomorrow.

Dissolve to:

INT. JACK'S OFFICE - SEVERAL DAYS LATER - MID MORNING

Jack is working at his desk. The door opens and Mark is standing there.

MARK
Hey Bud, it's here.

JACK
What's here?

MARK
All those rumors that were going around, it's happening. The Feds are downstairs right now. Better start packing.

JACK
What do you mean?

MARK
We're belly up. The party's over. Bankruptcy!

JACK 
But our stock price is up and... 

Suddenly two in black suits men appear at the door behind Mark. Mark steps aside and they enter holding out their badges.

MAN
We're sorry to tell you that Tyron has declared bankruptcy and we'll have to ask you to gather you're personal belonging. Someone will inspect them at the door on your way out. Thank you for your cooperation.

Jack appears startled and slumps back in his chair.

INT. JACK'S CAR IN TYRON'S PARKING LOT- later that MORNING.

Jack stares straight ahead for a few seconds. At the far side of the parking lot - he sees a cat approaching a large flock of black birds which then soar from the puddle at which they had been drinking. They vanish into the distant, gray mist. Jack sighs deeply, starts the car and leaves.  

INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - MID MORNING

Jack is standing, squinting pensively through the dirty window pane of his dingy, tenement apartment. The walls are in need of a paint job and the furniture has seen better days. Jack is with uncombed hair, is unshaven and wearing pajamas covered by a well-worn bathrobe. 

EXT. THE VIEW FROM JACK's WINDOW 

It is a grey day. The littered street below is bordered by aged, dirty facades and boarded store windows. Two homeless people are pushing shopping carts filled with plastic bags containing their meager possessions. Another sits in the mouth of an alleyway, semiconscious, with a bottle protruding from a paper bag by his side.

FLASHBACK TO:

INT. FUNERAL HOME - LATE AFTERNOON

Jack is standing before a closed coffin meeting a line of mourners. His daughter JANE is standing by his side.

MOUNER 1
I can't tell you how sorry I am. She put up one hell of a fight.

JACK
Thanks Arnie.

MOUNER 2
I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say.

Jane
Thanks. She was a good woman and a wonderful mother. 

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. IN FRONT OF JACK'S HOUSE - MID MORNING

Jack is standing on the sidewalk looking back at his daughter standing in the doorway of his old house. 

JANE
Do you think you have everything? Look around again just to be sure. 

JACK
No, I'm sure. I can't take much with me anyway. It's only three rooms you know.

JANE
Okay, grab the box and let's go!

She points to a large cardboard box on the step filled with pictures and a few books. On top is a frame of several military medals and decorations. He puts the box in the trunk of the Jane's car along with several others and they both get into the car.

INT. JANE'S CAR - LATER THAT MORNING

JACK 
(Muttering slowly)
Thirty-five years, gone in a flash!

JANE
What?

JACK
I was thinking out loud.

JANE
Are you sure you don't want to stay with us?

JACK 
(Solemnly)
You know I can't do that Honey.

INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - MID MORNING

Jack is now dressed and again is standing in front of the window with a vacant stare - the phone rings. He's startled out of his thoughts.

JACK 
(on the phone)
Hello.

JANE (O.C.) 
(On the phone)
Dad! Did you see the TV today?

JACK 
(on the phone)
No!

JANE (O.C.) 
(On the phone)
Turn it on. They have the verdict.

Jack hangs up the phone and walks to a small, old, CRT type TV sitting on a table at the corner of the room and turns in on.

TV NEWS ANNOUNCER
This latest news bulletin. James Wheeler, Hal Meter and several other high-ranking executives who have been found guilty in the collapse of Tyron have been sentenced today.Here comes John Hurley, Wheeler's lawyer now. Mr. Hurley - what is your opinion of today's sentencing?

HURLEY 
(on TV)
I think Judge Gavin was extremely fair. Justice prevailed. The judge's sentence speaks for itself. That's all I have to say. Thank you.

Jack snaps off the TV and sinks back into the chair next to the phone. A hateful look spreads over his face.

JACK 
(Muttering to himself disgustedly)
One year and a chump change fine! Justice prevailed! Son of a bitch!

Jack stares straight ahead for a moment. He then arises and leaves the apartment slamming the door behind. He stops, walks back and rattles the door knob.

JACK 
(Muttering to himself)
Gotta make sure it's locked. 
(With a sigh) 
But what's there to steal!

He turns and walks down the dimly lit stairs.

Chapter 3
I Think He’s Dead



EXT. THE FRONT OF JACK'S BUILDING - Moments later

Jack walks out of the front door and towards a bench at the front of the building. The sidewalk is dirty and littered. A group of small birds are gathered on the far side. Jack sits on the bench unwraps a short cigar and lights it. He reaches into his pocket, pulls out a hand full of popcorn and throws it to the birds. The birds are scurrying for the popcorn. Suddenly a Blue Jay chases the small birds around and begins to eat all the popcorn. HAL an old, gray haired, black man limps towards the bench.

HAL
How ya doin' Jack?

The muted tapping of a basketball being dribbled and banter of the players in a nearby court can be heard in the background.

JACK 
(Unconvincingly)
Not bad, Hal. How about you?

HAL
Okay, for an old man I guess. The knee is acting up a little again. It's that old Nam wound again. 
(a beat) 
Did you hear about Matty?

JACK
Matty- the guy who lives in the building next to yours?

HAL
Yeah! They walked him down to the bank and made him cash his Social Security check right in front of them and took the money right outta his hand.

JACK 
(Surprised)
They who? What do you mean 'Took the money'?

HAL
The Fireman! Petty punks! I guess they haven't got to your building yet. They come and say they're collectin' for the Fire Prevention Fund. They get fifty dollars a month outta everybody. Matty didn't pay so they marched him down to the bank and got the money out of him there and then.

JACK
What's the Fire Prevention Fund?

HAL
They say they'll make sure no fires start in your apartment. If you don't pay, they'll make sure fires do start. 
(a beat) 
You know Petey, the guy that lives in the other building next me? He wouldn't give them nothing. So last week he leaves and goes to the store and when he gets back, his door is knocked off the hinges and his bed is on fire. Lucky he got home when he did or the whole place woulda went up!

JACK
So what did he do after that?

HAL
Now he's payin' just like everybody else.

JACK
So why doesn't somebody call the cops?

HAL
Are you kiddin'? The cops don't want any part of down here. And second, who's gonna call? If they find out who did, you can be god damn sure that guy's gonna have a serious problem?

Jack looks away from Hal and stares straight ahead while puffing on his cigar. Hal begins of thumb through the newspaper he has brought with him. A brief silence.

JACK
Any good news in there?

HAL
Yanks won three in a row.

JACK
Well, that's about it for me. Gotta go up and get something together for lunch. See ya tomorrow.

HAL
Okay Bud!

Jack rises and walks towards his building.

INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - the next day - early MORNING 

A loud pounding at his apartment door awakens Jack.

JACK 
(Muttering to himself)
What the hell is going on?

He arises and stumbles to his door and opens it a crack. MRS. MURRAY, his downstairs neighbor is at the door sobbing and breathless. She is a frail, graying black woman and appears to be older than Jack. 

MRS. MURRAY
Let me in! Please let me in!

He opens the door widely. She hurries in and slumps in a chair.

JACK
What's the matter? What happened?

MRS. MURRAY 
(still sobbing)
I think he's dead! I know he's dead!

JACK
Who's dead?

MRS. MURRAY
The man in my apartment.

JACK
In your apartment?

MRS. MURRAY 
(Stammering)
He came to rob me.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. - MRS. MURRAY'S KITCHEN - the night before

Mrs. Murray goes to see about a noise at her door. The door is broken open as she approaches. A THUG with tattoos and holding a crowbar stands in the doorway.

MRS. MURRAY (O.C.)
(narrating)
I was in the kitchen. I was opening a can of cat food for Suzy when I heard a noise at my door. It was a thud. I got up to see what was going on and suddenly there he was in the doorway.

THUG
I need some cash. Whatta you got?

MRS. MURRAY 
(Quaking voice)
I don't have any except what's in there.
She backs into the kitchen, sinks to the floor in a corner and cowers. She points with a shaking hand to the drawer at side of the kitchen. The thug starts rifling through the drawer. Suddenly he looks up at her holding several bills.

THUG 
(Agitated)
You only got twenty bucks here!

The cat is old and feeble. It too is cowering in a corner. The cat tries to run as the Thug moves towards it but it is very slow. The Thug catches it and grabs the cat by the scruff of the neck, carries it over to the stove and turns on the burner.

THUG 
(while holding the squirming cat)
If you don't tell me where the rest of it is this cat is gonna get lit up.

Mrs. Murray is frantic. She spies the cat food can lid lying on the floor next to her and grabs it. She impulsively gets up and rushes towards him and slices it down the Thug's neck. Blood gushes from the wound. He drops the cat and crowbar, clutches his neck, stumbles backwards, slips on his own blood and falls striking his head on the radiator behind him. Mrs. Murray grabs a knife from the drawer and hovers over his motionless body.

MRS. MURRAY (O.C.)
I probably should have just run out but I was so scared. If he woke up I don't know what I would have done. I sat there next to him, frozen, for the whole night and he never moved. I tried to see if he was breathing and he wasn't.

JACK (O.C.)
So he's downstairs in your kitchen?

INT. MRS. MURRAY'S APARTMENT - LATEr that morning
Jack has left Mrs. Murray in his apartment and cautiously enters her apartment. He immediately spies the dead man by the radiator in a pool of blood. He checks for breath and sees none. He picks up the man's hand to check for a pulse and immediately drops it.

JACK 
(muttering)
Cold and dead alright!

CLOSE UP - "FM" IN A FLAME TATTOO ON DEAD MAN'S ARM

Jack hears the sound of footsteps in the hall through the partially opened apartment door. He jumps to his feet. Jack picks up the dead man's crowbar and turns towards the open door. Mrs. Murray suddenly appears.

JACK
I thought I told you to stay upstairs!

MRS. MURRAY 
(Voice quaking)
I couldn't stay alone. I was so afraid. What am I going to do? What am I going to do?

Jack lowers the crowbar and hesitates. He then speaks.

JACK
We can't have this spread all over. He's a gang member and they'll want revenge. We can't call the cops. If they see the cops coming here they'll find out in no time.

MRS. MURRAY
Then what should I do?

JACK
Well, we can't just leave him laying here on the kitchen floor. Let me go upstairs and you stay here. I'll be right back and this time do what I tell you - stay here!

Mrs. Murray takes a knife from the kitchen. She sits on the chair next to the body and holds the knife ready to strike if he should awaken. Jack leaves.

CROSSFADE:

He returns shortly with several large plastic garbage bags, a telephone cord and a scissors.

JACK
Get your vacuum cleaner and the hose with it.

He folds the body into a fetal pose and ties it with a piece of the telephone cord. Mrs. Murray returns with the vacuum.

JACK (CONT'D)
I have to tie him up so we can get him into the bag. If I wait much longer he'll stiffen up and we'll never be able get him in. Give me a bag.

He lifts the dead man's head and slides the bag over it and down over the shoulders. 

JACK (CONT'D)
Now, I'll lift the other end and you pull the bag all the way down. Okay, one, two, three - pull!

The corpse is finally pulled into the bag. Jack stands upright and points to the bag. He then speaks with an air of satisfaction.

JACK (CONT'D)
Lucky I remembered seeing those bags in the super's closet. He just fit. Give me the hose and plug the vacuum in.

He clamps the bag opening around the hose with both hands.

JACK (CONT'D)
Okay, start it up.

The bag shrinks to outline the body inside. Jack ties the opening closed with a piece of the telephone cord.

JACK (CONT'D)
Clean out the bottom of the bedroom closet and bring me the biggest towel you have.

Jack rolls the bag containing the body onto the towel and together they drag it to the closet.

JACK (CONT'D)
He's not as light as he looked. Okay, let's see if he fits in here.

The body is rolled into the closet and he pushes it to the rear as far as he can.

JACK (CONT'D) 
(Breathing heavily)
Do you have any moth flakes?

MRS. MURRAY
Yes!

She retrieves the moth flakes and Jack scatters them around the closet floor. He then takes some of her clothes off the hangers and covers the body with them.

MRS. MURRAY
We can't just leave him here can we?

JACK
We've got a few days to figure this out. He's going to keep just fine in that bag with the air sucked out. Let's go in and clean up the kitchen.

MRS. MURRAY
I can't stay here with him in the closet like that. I'll be scared to death. What if he wakes up?

JACK
Wakes up! What are you kidding me? Unless I see Jesus Christ coming through that door, he's not waking up. 

MRS. MURRAY
I still can't stay here. I'm so scared.

Jack pauses and sighs.

JACK
Okay, you can come up and stay with me for a while. You can have the bed. I'll stay on the sofa. 

MRS. MURRAY 
(Exuberantly)
Oh, thank you! Thank you! 
(Meekly) 
What about Suzy?

JACK 
(Slightly irritated) 
Oh shit! Okay, the cat can come too. Just be sure to bring the litter box.

INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - the next day - EARLY MORNING 

JACK is lying on the sofa wide awake. He arises and carefully checks Mrs. Murray who is still sleeping in his bedroom. He dresses and walks to her apartment to check the body. He cautiously opens the closet and peers in and takes a deep breath (sniff).

JACK 
(Muttering to himself)
Just the moth flakes - good! 

Chapter 4
Divided We Fall



EXT. THE BENCH - LATEr MORNING the same day.

Both Jack and Hal are seated and in conversation.

HAL
Hey, ya know what I heard? I heard the boy that was runnin' the FM gang went disappeared.

JACK 
(Feinting ignorance)
What do you mean disappeared?

HAL
Well, the way I heard it, they been havin' some problems with a rival uptown gang and they think he was killed and dumped by them. Too bad!

JACK
What do you mean 'Too bad'?

HAL
All of 'em shoulda been killed. The whole bunch.

JACK
Are they still collecting from everybody?

HAL
You don't think a little thing like one of 'em gettin' killed is gonna stop 'em do ya?

JACK
Did they come to get dues from you yet?

HAL
Not yet. But I think they're comin'. They're kinda workin' their way down the block from buildin' to buildin'. They haven't got to mine yet. I'm pretty sure that they'll be comin' soon and to your buildin' too.

JACK
What are you going to do?

HAL
Don't know. I'd like to say that I'm not gonna give 'em nothing but who knows. If they got Petey to pay up, I don't know. He's a tough buckaroo and he paid. 
(a beat) 
What about you, Jack?

JACK
I don't know either. I guess I'll have to wait and see. (Pause) Did you ever hear of Aesop?

HAL
Aesop? Where does he live?

JACK
No! Aesop was a famous old Greek story writer. He said 'United we stand, divided we fall'. Do you know what that means Hal?

HAL
Yeah, sure! Ya gotta stick together or you're done for.

JACK
Right!

HAL
Who are we gonna unite and what are we gonna do? We're all too old.

JACK 
(Angrily)
We're old but we're not dead and we're not stupid.
(Pause) 
Did you ever play Bocce, Hal?

HAL
Never even heard of it!

JACK
How would you like to learn? There's a Bocce court down at the other end of the park. Nobody ever uses it. I've got the balls. Let's go tomorrow and I'll show you how to play.

HAL
I guess. It's gotta be better than sittin' here all day.

JACK
And Hal - ask Petey to come too. Okay?

HAL
Sure!

They both leave the bench.

EXT. BOCCE COURT - the next day - EARLY AFTERNOON

JACK
Hey, Hal you made it, and you brought PETEY with you.

HAL
Yeah, Jack this is Petey; Petey, Jack.

JACK
Now let me tell you how we play this game.

DISSOLVE TO:

They are in the midst of playing and talking as they play.

JACK
Hal tells me you live over by him in the gray, brick building.

PETEY
Yeah, been there for about three years now.

JACK
How is it?

PETEY
Are you kiddin'? It's like all the other places in this neighbor, it's for shit! But everybody's gotta live somewhere and this is it for us.

JACK
How’d you wind up here?

PETEY
I wound up broke, that's how. Not a pot to piss in.

JACK
Hal told me that you were in Special Forces during Nam. How long were you in the service?

PETEY
'Bout eighteen years.

JACK
And you didn't get a pension?

PETEY
That's a long story. A long sad story.

JACK
We've got all afternoon!

PETEY
I don't even wanna talk about it. Let Hal tell ya if he wants to. He knows the whole thing.

Hal gets an approving glance from Petey and he begins.

HAL
When Petey was in Nam he had a commanding officer and well, they didn't see eye to eye about a lot of stuff.

JACK 
(Interjects)
What do you mean?

FLASHBACK begin:

Ext. A vietnam village during the war - afternoon - (stock)

Villagers are being rounded up by soldier as Hal speaks.

HAL
Treatin' people. A woman in the village they were in came to Petey and told him the Lieutenant had raped her kid. The kid was twelve and Petey was gonna report it. He had to. It was military law. Somehow the Lieutenant found out that Petey knew so he went to the girl and forced her to accuse Petey before he could report it.

Ext. Vietnam jungle - afternoon - (stock)

Soldiers are stealthy tramping through the jungle. 

PETEY (O.C.) 
(Interjecting soberly)
He even got some of the guys in our company to say that I bragged about it to them. He told them 'If you don't go with it you'll be point man on every mission from here on out'. You know what that means; you'll probably be a short timer. You'll be goin' home real soon - in a box.

Flashback end: 

Ext. Back at the bocce court - minutes later

Petey is continuing his story at the Bocce court.

PETEY (CONT'D)
So I wound up doing three years in the brig and got a Dishonorable. And here's the bitch of it. Shay - that was the guy's name; he wound up in the Pentagon, a full bird colonel. 

JACK
And what happened to you? How did you wind up here?

PETEY
When I got out I went lookin' for a job. What kinda job are you gonna get with my record? Not a good one, that's for sure. So I kinda bounced around from one shitty job to the next. Never got a military pension, of course. All I got is a little Social Security and that's it.

JACK
Sounds like you really got a screwin'.

PETEY
I'd say so. And ya know what! I think about it every goddamn day. I don't know what's worse, what happened or the thinkin' about it day after day after day.

JACK
I know. I know what you mean.

There is a brief silence and Jack turns to Hal.

JACK
Hey, ya know Hal; you never told me how life treated you. We talked a lot but every time I brought it up you kinda danced around it. Since we're all here spilling out our guts, I think it's your turn.

HAL
Ain't my turn. No use whinin' 'bout things gone by.

JACK
I don't think anybody's whining, just telling like it is. What do you think Petey?

PETEY 
(Nodding)
I guess. I showed you mine maybe you should show us yours Hal?

A silence and Hal reluctantly speaks.

HAL
Well, I suppose but there ain't a hellava lot to tell. Grew up down south. Didn't have shit.

FLASHBACK BEGIN:

Ext. Main street of an old southern town - afternoon - (stock)

The camera pans down the hot, dusty, main street of the old rural town as Hal speaks.

HAL (o.C.)
Dad got real sick. Ma, she couldn't work. She stayed home to take care of him. We lived on his Social Security. After a while the money we were getting just wasn't enough so she hadda get a job. She use ta lock the old man in the bedroom and go to work and hope for the best.

PETEY (O.C.)
How about your brothers and sisters. Couldn't they help out?

HAL (O.C.)
Ain't got none.

Ext. A 50s high football game - afternoon- (stock)

The game is being played as Hal continues to speak.

HAL (CONT'D)
Anyways, my town was a good old southern football town. In school everybody was expected to play unless you was crippled. We won thirty-two games in a row and were state champs for five years straight when I started.

JACK (O.C.)
And you played?

HAL (O.C.)
Are you kiddin'? Two hundred and ten pounds, six foot two, of course I played. Don't mean to be braggin', but I was good. All-State three years runnin' and still got the state rushin' record. After high school I got a scholarship to college. They called it a scholarship but it was really a job to play football. I don't remember seein' too many classrooms but I did see lots of locker rooms. I was second team All-American as a senior. After the last game, I got the C.O.A.

FLASHBACK END: 

Ext. Back at the bocce court - minutes later

JACK
A C.O.A.? What's that?

HAL
Certificate of Attendance. No diploma, just a weak handshake and a kick in the ass out the door. That's pretty much what most guys got then.

JACK
So what did you do then?

HAL
Got a job - what else. I was drivin' a bulldozer. That was a pretty good job in my town and I only got it cause I was kinda the local football hero.

JACK
So you did that all your life?

HAL
Nah, only for a year or two. Then one day I read about a guy I knew from college playin' pro ball. I knew I was better than him so I called my old coach to see if he could help me out. 

JACK
And?

HAL
This was the fifties. Coach told me that there wasn't too much room for a black guy in pro ball unless you was like Jim Brown.

PETEY
What about the guy you saw in the paper, the guy you played with?

HAL
He was a white guy.

JACK
So what did you do then?

HAL
I got another job in a plastics factory. A little more money than the bulldozer job. Worked there for forty years. The company got sold and the pension was sold off too. That happened a lot in those days. They'd buy a company, steal the pension money and fold up the company.

PETEY
Gotta family?

HAL
Wife died 'bout ten years ago. I got two boys.

PETEY
Do ya see 'em much?

HAL
Not really! They got some serious problems on their own.

JACK
So how do you get by?

HAL
I got Social Security. I get food stamps and a little rent help by the government, so I'm hangin' in. That's about it man.

PETEY
It must really piss you off when you watch football today? Guys making millions?

HAL
Born too soon I guess but that's the way it is. What can ya do?

Int. Mrs.murray's apartment - later that evening.

Jack climbs the stairs and stands before the apartment door. It is taped shut with a piece of duct tape. He hesitatingly enters the apartment. He immediately goes to the closet to view the body. He takes a deep breath (sniff). A slight smile crosses his face. Being satisfied that it has been undisturbed, he closed the closet and walks up the stairs towards his apartment. 

CROSSFADe:

EXT. THE BENCH - the next day - EARLY AFTERNOON

Jack is sitting and smoking as Petey approaches.

JACK
Where's Hal?

PETEY
Said he hadda go somewhere.

JACK
Sit down. Do you smoke? I got an extra one right here.

PETEY
Nah, thanks anyways but I gave it up when cigarettes were thirty-five cents a pack. I know if I smoke a cigar I'll be right back. I used to do a pack and a half a day. I don't want to take a chance.

JACK
Yeah, I get it. Hey, how did you like that Bocce?

PETEY
Pretty good. A lot of fun.

JACK
Wanta play tomorrow?

PETEY
I'd like to but I'm going fishing. Did you ever fish?

JACK
When I was a kid. 

PETEY
Did you like it?

JACK
Yeah, it was fun. Nice and relaxing. Quiet. I'd even say serene.

PETEY
Wanta go with me tomorrow?

JACK
I'd need to get equipment and a license. 

PETEY
Not where I'm going. I'm going to a friend of mine's place up state. I was in the service with him. He's got a fish farm. He raises trout and got a big pond in the back. He stocks fish in there and charges people to fish. You don't need a license because it's not public waters. He even supplies the rod and reel and all the fishing stuff if you don't have your own.

JACK
How much does it cost?

PETEY
For me and you, free. I've known LARRY for thirty years. You just gotta bring him a case of beer. What do you think?

JACK
Is Hal going?

PETEY
Can't, he's got some stuff he's gotta do again tomorrow he said.

JACK
Well, sounds like a good time. I'll be like a kid again. Sure, sign me up. I'll go!

PETEY
I'll pick you up at about eight-thirty. It'll take around an hour to get there. Just gotta hope for good weather. It's supposed to be nice. And, bring a couple of extra cigars. LARRY's a cigar guy.

Chapter 5
Fishing



EXT. PETEY'S CAR in front of JACK's building - EARLY MORNING.

Jack is about to enter the car.

PETEY
Throw those papers in the back and hop in. I got the beer in the trunk. Away we go!

JACK
Where'd you get this?

PETEY
My daughter's kid. She went to college with it and when she graduated, like all the kids today, first thing she does is gets a new car. So I got this. Looks like shit but runs good. Good for around here too. Who's gonna steal it?

DISSOLVE TO:

They have been driving for a while. A roadside sign appears through the windshield - LARRY's Fishin' Hole - No License Required. Petey turns down the long dusty road to Larry's.

EXT. LARRY'S FRONT PORCH - LATEr MORNING

Larry is sitting on the ram-shackled porch. His dog Rusty is lying next to him. He is slowly rocking back and forth as the car approaches. He continues to rock. Jack and Petey exit the car and walk towards Larry. 

LARRY
(Boisterously)
What do we got here? Two fishin' city slickers? How ya been PETEY? Ya look okay. Ain't seen ya since last year.

PETEY
Doin' good Larry, doin' good. This is Jack, a buddy of mine from around the corner by me.

Larry stands and shakes Jack's hand while talking to Petey.

LARRY
Got the beer?

PETEY
Sure do! In the trunk with a bag of ice on it just like usual.

LARRY
Well get it on out here.

Petey gets the beer from the trunk and they all go inside.

CUT TO:

INT. inside LARRY'S HOUSE - as they enter.

Rusty (Larry's dog) immediately runs and jumps onto the torn, stained sofa. The house is really a shack consisting of three rooms. The living room where they are seated has two old, overstuffed chairs and the sofa all covered with dog hair. A portion of a crack in the ceiling is covered with duct tape and a small kerosene heater is mounted against one wall. The floor is covered with faded, worn linoleum.   

LARRY
Rusty! Get the fuck off!

The dog immediately jumps from sofa and scurries to his cardboard box bed in the corner.

LARRY (CONT'D)
Grab one of the beers and sit down. Let's talk a bit and then we'll get to doing some fishin'. How's things down by you? Just as shitty as here I suppose?

JACK
Yeah, but probably worse. Here, at least, you don't have street gangs breakin' your balls.

LARRY 
(Laughing)
Street gangs! We don't even have streets! So, what's with these gangs anyway?

JACK 
(Nodding to Petey)
Go ahead Petey, tell 'em what happened to you the other day.

PETEY 
(Hesitatingly)
Some punks in the neighbor came around shakin' down everybody for protection money. I refused to pay 'em so a couple days later they tried to burn me out. I got home just in time or the whole place woulda gone up.

LARRY
Then what?

PETEY
Gotta pay 'em!

LARRY
I can't believe you'd ever take that shit!

He points to a shotgun in the corner.

LARRY (CONT'D)
Maybe you gotta get yourself a gun. I got one right here. I'll loan ya for as long as ya want. I know you're pretty good with it Petey. I saw you in Nam shootin' them gooks, like they was tin cans off a fence post. 

Larry gets the gun and hands it to Petey.

LARRY (CONT'D)
What about you Jack? I got one you can use too, if you want it?

JACK
It's not that simple. There's dozens of them and they pretty much run the neighborhood. You can't just go around shooting them. If you threaten them, you're going to have to lock every door, every window and never leave the house or you'll be a dead man. There's not much you can do even with a gun.

Larry looks down at the floor for a moment and hesitates.

LARRY
I suppose your right but I couldn't be livin' that way. I'd have ta fight back somehow. Livin' in fear all the time and kissin' these bastards asses ain't no way to live. Knowin' you Petey, I'm kinda surprised that you're suckin' down all this shit. I remember you bein' an awful lot tougher than that.

PETEY
Sure Larry, I was an awful lot younger too. And besides just like JACK told you, there isn't much we can do.

LARRY
Ain't no excuse. Just because you got older, don't mean you gotta take all that shit. There's gotta be something you could do. 
(a beat) 
Well, you guys think about it and if you want those guns there right here for yas. And if you need my help, I'll even come down and give ya a hand at teachin' these pricks a lesson. Just gimme a call. Now, let's do some fishin'. Grab those poles over there.

EXT. THE FISH PONDS - EARLY AFTERNOON

They are walking by the pond with the fishing equipment. Larry is chewing on a half smoked cigar. A large school of fish churn the water near the bank. The school follows them as they walk along the edge of the pond.

JACK
Look at these guys. They look like piranha without the teeth. There's hundreds of them.

LARRY
Oh, they think they're getting fed. Every time you come near the pond they think its dinner time.

JACK
What do you feed them?

LARRY
Use ta be liver but that got expensive and messy, so now I use commercial food. Dried stuff. It's cleaner and cheaper. But they'll eat anything that you throw in there. Watch this.

Larry throws his cigar butt into the pond and the fish devour it instantly.

LARRY (CONT'D)
See what I mean?

Jack points to small holes dug into the bank of the pond on the other side of the pond.

JACK
What's all those holes?

LARRY
Rats!

JACK
Rats?

LARRY
Yeah, lots of rats are livin' by the ponds. They survive on the fish food that falls on the bank when I feed the fish. If I feed 'em and come back an hour later there ain't a scrap nowhere. The rats get is all clean as could be.

They walk towards another pond. Larry points to the path and then to a chipper and a pile of wood chips alongside it.

LARRY (CONT'D)
Here, we gotta go this way. I got all my equipment blocking the road. Tryin' to clean the brush away from the bank over there so there's more fishin' room. That reminds me, I gotta call Ted. When I get a big pile, he comes down and picks 'em up. 

PETEY
What's he do with them?

LARRY
Don't really know, I think landscaping. I know his son's in the business. I don't really care as long as he gets 'em out of here.

JACK 
(laughing) 
Why don't you feed them to the fish?

LARRY 
(laughing) 
Don't ya think I haven't thought about it?

EXT. PETEY CAR - EARLY EVENING

Jack and Petey are riding home after the day of fishing with Larry.

JACK
Wonder if I remember how to cook them?

PETEY
Nothin' to it. Larry already cleaned and filleted them for us. All you gotta do is put some butter in the pan and fry 'em up. And there you have it. A great fish dinner.

JACK
Yeah, Larry is a cool guy, kinda rough on the edges but cool. Man, he was really into guttin' those fish like he did.

PETEY
Sure is. He'd do anything to help you. You know when he was talkin' about the guns and comin' down and helpin' out, he wasn't shittin'. He'd do it. I was with him in Nam one time when he got into it with three guys. They beat the livin' shit out of him. Two days later, he came back with a bat and gave all three a good old ass kickin'. Larry never was no good at takin' shit from nobody. He didn't care who, what or where, he wasn't about to suck it down and he hasn't changed a bit.

JACK
What's with that big fuckin' scar on his cheek?

PETEY
He got shot by a Cong right through the cheek. The bullet went in one side and out the other and blasted out most of his back teeth on the way through. The way he tells it, he just spit 'em out and kept on shotin' and knowin' Larry the way I do, it's most probably true.

EXT. JACK'S APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING

They pull up to Jack's apartment building. Police cars and an ambulance are in front with lights flashing. The front door is wide open and a stretcher is being carried out.

CLOSE UP - JACK'S STUNNED STARE

PETEY
Somebody probably died and they're pickin' up the body. When you got a lotta old people livin' here ya gotta expect it. Happens all the time.

Petey hands Jack a scrap of paper.

PETEY (CONT'D)
Jack, here's Larry's number. Remember you asked me for it before?

Jack is speaking in a hollow, voice and still staring at the commotion in front of his building as he takes the note from Petey.

JACK
Thanks, Petey.

Jack gets out of the car and starts to walk robotically towards the building. Petey pops the trunk lid and shouts to Jack.
.
PETEY
Jack - get your fish out of the trunk.

JACK
Oh yeah, sure - thanks.

Jack slowly turns and while still staring, goes to the trunk to get the fish. He then approaches the onlookers in front of the building.

JACK
What's going on?

A BYSTANDER
I think it's an old lady.

JACK
What about the old lady?

BYSTANDER
Think she had a heart attack. They found her in the hallway. Here, they're bringing her out now.

Mrs. Murray is being carried on a stretcher to the ambulance. As they pass Jack he goes over to her.

JACK
Mrs. Murray! What happened?

MRS. MURRAY
I don't know Jack, I just passed out and the next thing I knew these men were here. They said I had a heart attack but I don't really remember.

EMT
Excuse me Sir. We've got to get her to the hospital.

Jack is nudged out of the way by one of the EMTs. Jack speaks to the man in an excited voice.

JACK
Well how is she?

EMT
We think she's going to be okay but that's for the doctors to decide.

JACK 
(Muttering sigh)
Thank God.

The ambulance doors close and it takes off down the street with sirens blaring. The crowd dissipates and Jack is left standing alone momentarily. He then suddenly begins walking hurriedly towards the apartment.

INT. MRS. MURRAY'S APARTMENT - LATE EVENING

Jack races into her apartment. The still broken door is held closed with a strip of duct tape. He enters and hurriedly checks the closet. The bag with the body is just as he left it. He slumps into a relaxed pose, closes the closet door and leaves the apartment. 


Chapter 6
House cleaning



INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - LATEr that EVENING

Jack sits pensively for a few seconds. He then takes the paper scrap given to him by PETEY from his pocket. A few more seconds and he reluctantly reaches for the phone and dials.

Intercutting between JACK and LARRY: 

JACK 
(on the phone)
Hello Larry - this is Jack.

LARRY 
(on the phone and laughing)
What's the matter? Ya forget something or ya just wanta come back tomorrow for some more fishin'?

JACK 
(on the phone)
No Larry! I really did like it but that's not why I called. Remember this morning, when we were talking about our problem here and you said you'd help out if you could? Did you mean it?

LARRY
(on the phone)
I don't never say nothin' I don't really mean unless I'm jokin' and that wasn't no joke. I hate to see anybody get abused by those shit bags, especially when their friends of mine that's bein' abused.

JACK 
(on the phone)
Well, I got this problem..

Jack begins to explain to Larry on the phone.

TIME CUT:

LARRY 
(on the phone)
Okay then, I'll see you tomorrow if you can get Petey to drive you back up. Call me before you come so I can be sure I don't have any customers around and I can get everything ready.

Jack hangs up the phone and calls Petey.

JACK 
(on the phone)
Petey, this is Jack. Can you do me a favor tomorrow, really two favors?

PETEY 
(on the phone)
Sure Jack.

JACK 
(on the phone)
First I need you to go down to the furniture store on Hastings Street and get an empty box - the biggest one that will fit in your trunk. I'm going to get rid of an old TV for the lady downstairs. I want you to help me carry it out. I want the box so just in case we drop it; the glass doesn't fly all over. Then we'll take it up to Larry. It still plays good and he said he'd be glad to have it. What do you think?

PETEY 
(on the phone)
Sure Jack, I'll be over tomorrow morning as soon as I get the box.

EXT. FRONT OF JACK'S BUILDING - EARLY MORNING

Petey is pointing to the box in the trunk of his car.

PETEY
Is this the kind you wanted?

JACK
Perfect!

Jack hands Petey $5. 

JACK
Listen, go to the Dunkin Donuts over there on Haynes Street and get us some coffee and donuts for the ride up to Larry's. And Petey, make sure you get Dunkin Donuts coffee. That other stuff tastes like piss.

PETEY
Okay, but don't ya need some help with the TV?

JACK
Yeah, to get it down the stairs. I'll go up and load it into the box while you get the coffee.

Petey leaves and Jack walks back to the building.

INT. MRS. MURRAY'S APARTMENT - while PETEY is gone 

Jack struggles to load the body into the box. He stuffs newspaper around it and ties the box closed with heavy twine. He slides the box out into the hall. Petey finally returns with the coffee.

JACK
Let's get it down these stairs and into the car. I'll take the bottom.

PETEY
God damn, this is some heavy TV!

JACK
They don't make 'em like they used to. The old ones like this are heavy okay.

EXT. PETEY'S CAR in front of the building - moments later

They wrestle the box into the trunk. The box does not completely fit in the trunk. Jack secures the trunk lid down on the protruding box with a cord and they leave for Larry's.

EXT. LARRY'S PORCH - the same day - early afternoon

All three with beers. A train whistle sounds in the distance. Suddenly Larry stands up and looks at a dust cloud rising from a car coming down the lane. He squints to see who it might be.

LARRY
Who the hell is that? I thought I put up the closed sign?

A police car slowly comes into view. It stops in front of the porch and the COP steps out. It's the cop who stopped Jack and Petey earlier that morning.

COP
How's it going?

LARRY 
(Calmly)
Not bad Tim. Not bad. How about yourself?

COP
Okay! I saw that closed sign out front. I wanted to bring my kid over tomorrow to do some fishing. Are you gonna be closed tomorrow too?

LARRY
No, back in business tomorrow.

COP
Great! How'd you guys make it here with that TV? It was just about hanging out of your trunk and I was wondering if you made down this old bumpy road here without it falling out?

JACK
Yeah, we made it down okay.

COP
How's it workin'? Reception's not too good around here ya know?

LARRY
Ain't hooked it up yet. Want a beer Tim?

COP
Not when I'm drivin' the car here. But thanks anyway. I'll see you tomorrow then. So long boys. Have a safe one home.

EXT. THE BENCH - the next day - MID MORNING 

JACK 
(Casually)
What's you hearing around the neighborhood?

HAL
Well, yesterday, a guy in the building next to mine was tellin' me that he heard some street talk.

JACK
Street talk? What do you mean?

HAL
Stuff about that gang of young bastards, you know, the Firemen.

JACK
So what did he hear?

HAL
The gang that they thought took out their boss man really didn't have nothin' to do with it.

JACK
What do you mean?

HAL
They're all startin' to say he just took off with a bunch of their money.

JACK
How's that?

HAL
Sandman, he was the head honcho and he used ta carry most of the cash and whenever any of 'em needed any he would just peeled it off to them. He used ta give 'em chits, like little pieces of paper tellin' 'em how much they had comin'. Like a bank I guess.

JACK 
(Shocked)
You said he always kept the cash on him? In his pocket? Are you sure?

HAL
I'm not sure about any of this. I'm just tellin' you what I was told.

JACK
How come the rest of them went along with that? Why didn't they just demand their money right up front?

HAL
I don't know. I guess because Sandman was a pretty merciless dude. Did you ever notice the one of them that has a patch over one eye?

JACK
I've seen him around.

HAL
Here's how he got that patch. One time he got in Sandman's face about the money setup and Sandman wound up cuttin' his eye out. That set the rest of them straight. They just did exactly what they was told, after seein' that. They're all shittin' in their pants. 

JACK
Why do they call him? Sandman?

HAL
Cause he don't mind puttin' people to sleep, for keeps!

JACK
Do you know who's in charge now? 

HAL
They call him DS. That stands for Deuce of Spades, like he's number two and he's good at puttin' people in the ground too. I guess that's where the Spades comes in.

JACK
Who's telling you all this anyway? What's his name?

HAL
Like I told ya, he's a guy that lives in the building next to mine. His name is Frank. I don't know his last name. I was takin' the garbage out yesterday and I happened to meet him. He had a Nam tattoo. I saw it and I started talkin' to him. He was over there in the Delta when Petey was there. He even had a couple of holes in his leg as souvenirs.

JACK
Well, how does he know all this shit about the FM?

HAL
He used to go almost every day over to the Box, you know the Lunch Box, that little divey place on Hudson Street. He went about ten o'clock in the morning to get a little breakfast and who was always in there but a bunch of FMers. They always sit at the same table and bullshit with each other for an hour or two and he overheard it all.

JACK
He doesn't go there anymore?

HAL: Nah, he said listenin' to all their bullshit, day after day was gettin' him so pissed off that he was beginnin' to be afraid that he'd start sayin' something to 'em. He thought maybe he couldn't control himself anymore. So he just decided to stay away.

JACK 
(Puffing the cigar)
Where's Hudson Street? The Lunch Box?

HAL
It's about three blocks down and turn left. Ya can't miss it. Just look for the place with the windows that ain't been washed in a couple years.

Chapter 7
Ponder and Deliberate



CUT TO:

EXT. IN FRONT OF THE LUNCH BOX - the next day - EARLY MORNING

The Lunch Box is a broken down eatery that's seen its day. Jack peers through the dirty window and goes in. It has a worn scarred Formica counter with stools bearing duct tape patching on several. A greasy mirror is behind the counter and four worn booths also wearing duct tape patches line the opposite wall. Four gang members sit in the last booth. Jack quietly sits at the counter just within hearing distance. CHARLIE, the owner and cook, is behind the counter wearing a stained apron. He is a large, man in his fifties with a protruding belly and slicked back, oily hair. Jack orders a coffee. Jack listens intently to the conservation at the booth behind him. 

DISSOLVE TO:

Charlie is standing in front of Jack behind the counter washing some cups. 

DEUCE OF SPADES (DS) 
(Laughing)
Put it on my tab Charlie. I'm buyin' today.

CHARLIE 
(Mumbles under his breath angrily)
Those bastards! Every god damn day. Same shit!

Both Jack and Charlie speak softly so as not to be heard by those at the booth.

The gang gets up and begins to leave.

JACK
What's the problem?

CHARLIE
Those fuckin' bums come in here every day, order up breakfast and never pay a dime.

JACK
He just said, 'Put it on his tab', didn't he?

CHARLIE
Are you shittin' me? Tab! There's no tab. The only tab there would be, would be my hospital bill if I tried to collect.

JACK
Why not call the cops?

CHARLIE
Cops! They're more afraid of those punks than I am! And, even if I did call, the next thing would be, my place would get burned out. Did you see the FM tats on the back of their hands? They call themselves the Firemen. Why do you think? It's sure not because they put fires out! They start 'em.

JACK
It's a bitch alright!

CUT TO:

INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - EARLY AFTERNOON

Jack is on the phone.

Intercutting between JACK and LARRY: 

Jack (on the phone):  Larry, its Jack. I had to call you. You know that TV we brought up the other day, the one we had to get rid of because it was broken? Remember the stuff we burned up afterwards?

LARRY (O.C.) 
(on the phone) 
Sure Jack, what about it?

JACK 
(on the phone)
Well, I come to find out there was a shit load of money in there. We didn't even look. I guess we were in such a hurry to do what we had to do, that we never even looked.

LARRY 
(on the phone)
Man! What a hump! Next time, we'll make god damn sure we take a real good look.

JACK (O.C.) 
(on the phone)
Next time?

LARRY 
(on the phone)
There's more of 'em ain't there? For every rat ya kill there's always a dozen more down in the holes. You're not gonna keep taken this shit, are you, Jack?

JACK 
(on the phone)
They haven't bothered me yet. I've got no problem with them. I don't like what they're doing, but they're not bothering me any.

LARRY (O.C.) 
(on the phone)
From what you told me -they will! And when they do you'll get sick of it real quick and I might be gettin' a call about some more free food for my boys. I'll be waitin' by the phone.

INT. JACK APARTMENT - EARLY that NIGHT 

Jack hears a loud banging at his door. He goes to the door and looks through the peephole and sees three thugs which he recognizes from the Lunch Box.

THUG 1
Open the door!

THUG 2 
(Laughing)
Open the door or we'll huff and we'll puff and we'll blow your house down.

JACK
What do you want?

THUG 3
What the fuck do you think we want? We want to get in. Open the fuckin' door!

Jack slowly cracks open the door and they push their way in breaking the chain latch off the door jamb.

THUG 1 
(Sarcastically)
That's a boy. We're here doin' some charity work. We're collectin' for a community group called the Firemen's Fund. I'm sure you've heard about some of the apartment fires here in the neighborhood haven't you? It's a god damn shame isn't it?

Jack says nothing.

THUG 1 (CONT'D)
I guess you heard about the one over on Hayes Street and the one on Aryers. If those people woulda had us on the job, I bet those fires never would a happened. What do ya think?

Jack is again silent.

THUG 1 (CONT'D)
What we do is we make sure that kinda thing doesn't happen to you. Now, it's hard to keep this kinda service going without support. We're here to ask for your contribution. We suggest, strongly suggest, a fifty dollar per month donation.

Jack still says nothing.

THUG 3 
(Impatiently)
Let's quit the bullshit. Give up the fifty bucks and ya don't get burned out.

Jack slowly reaches into his pocket and hands them forty dollars.

THUG 1
You're light my man. I said fifty.

JACK
It's all I've got now.

THUG 2 
(snarling)
Okay, but we'll be back next month and it'll be sixty bucks. That'll give ya a whole month to save up.

They leave and move down the hall to the next apartment door. Jack closes his door and lumps in a chair. He can hear them pounding on the next apartment door.

JACK 
(Aloud to himself)
What a bitch.

EXT. THE BENCH - the next day - MID MORNING  

Hal approaches Jack. He has a splint and bandage on his finger and is still limping. He holds his hand by his side away from Jack in a weak attempt to hide it, however Jack immediately spots it. Jack proceeds to slowly pry information out of the reluctant Hal.

JACK
Hey man, what the hell happened to you? Your hand! What happened to your hand?

HAL
Oh, that! Got my finger busted.

JACK
Well yeah, but how?

HAL
Got it slammed in a door. Broke the little finger real good.

JACK
Slammed in a door? How did you do that?

HAL
Don't make no difference how, it just got smashed.

JACK
You seem kinda jittery Hal. What's the problem?

HAL
No problem Jack. No problem!

JACK
How long have I known you Hal?

HAL
Don't know. I guess pretty much ever since I moved here.

JACK
How much time do you figure we spend on this bench every week?

HAL
I suppose a couple hours a day, except in bad weather.

JACK
I'm not a great math guy but I'd say that adds up to a shit load of hours. What do you think?

HAL
Probably right.

JACK
I think then, we can pretty much tell when the other one of us isn't tellin' the whole truth.

HAL
Suppose so.

JACK
So what happened to the hand?

Hal hesitates and then speaks.

HAL
It happened last night.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING

One of the local gang members is pounding on Hal's door. Hal gets up from his seat. There are several empty beer bottles on the table in front of him. He is unsteady, with a beer in his hand as he goes to the door and looks out through the peephole.

THUG 1 
(loudly)
We're here collectin' for charity. Open the door.

HAL 
(Slurring)
Fuck you, you scum bags. You're not getting' a god damn dime, now get outta here.

THUG 3 
(threateningly)
If ya know what's good for you you'll open the fuckin' door.

HAL
Blow me.

Hal stumbles back from the door and starts walking away. Suddenly the door is broken open by the gang and they stream in. They push Hal into the bathroom and backwards down into the bathtub. He is lying on his back in the tub with one of the thugs grasping him by his shirt collar. Another pulls Hal's wallet out of his pocket and takes the money. Suddenly DS appears in the bathroom doorway.

DS
What the fuck is goin' on with this guy?

THUG 1
He ain't exactly cooperating with the program.

DS
We can't be goin' through this every time. If this gets out we're gonna have trouble with all the other ones too. Get him over here.

They pull Hal out of the bathtub and over towards the bathroom door. Hal struggles unsuccessfully. DS grabs Hal's hand and sticks his little finger in the crack between the door and the jamb by the hinge. His hand is held there as he continues to struggle. 

DS 
(yelling)
Okay let her go.

One of the others slams the door towards the closed position crushing Hal's finger. Hal screams and is released as the thugs begin to leave. He falls to the floor clutching his hand. DS yells as they leave.

DS
Next time it'll be your dick!

Hal is on the bathroom floor writhing in pain.

CROSSFADE:

EXT. THE BENCH - hal has finished his story

Jack and Hal continue their conversation.

JACK
Holy shit! What did you do then? 

HAL
What could I do? I packed my hand in ice and walked to the hospital ER down on Bradley; they set my finger and gave me some pain pills.

A long silence before Jack speaks.

JACK
Ponder and deliberate before you make a move.

HAL
What?

JACK
Sun Tzu - The Art of War. It was written by an ancient Chinese warlord about twenty-five hundred years ago. It means, think before you act and you will succeed. We have to think what we're going to do.

HAL
What do you mean, 'gonna do'?

JACK
You don't think we can just sit around and let this kinda shit keep happening over and over, do you?

HAL
Well, what are we gonna do about it?

JACK
That's what I just said, 'Ponder and deliberate before you act'. We have to decide how to stop this and soon. Something else Sun Tzu said was 'In order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger'. I know, I'm pretty pissed off and I'm sure you are too.

HAL
I guess then, all we gotta do is the 'ponder and deliberate' part. And, by the way, where did you get all this Chinese stuff from?

JACK
When I was in the service, I had this drill sergeant. He loved 'The Art of War'. He used to carry quotes from it in his shirt pocket. He'd say them every day. He even made us learn them by heart. We'd get the quote of the day, every day and the next day he'd call guys at random and ask them about the quote. If you didn't know it you we're in for some heavy ball bustin'. When I was going through it, I thought it was a bunch of shit but lots of times later those words served me well. This problem we've got here is war and Sun Tzu can help us win it. Bring Petey over with you tomorrow. 

CUT TO:

EXT. HALLWAY IN FRONT OF MRS. MURRAY'S DOOR - LATEr that AFTERNOON.

Jack stands before Mrs. Murray's which still hasn't been fixed. He cracks open the unlocked door and stealthily whispers into the apartment.

JACK 
(Softly)
Mrs. Murray? Ellen?

MRS. MURRAY (O.S.)
Jack, is that you?

JACK
Yes. I saw that your door was open. I see you're back from the hospital. Are you feeling alright?

MRS. MURRAY
I'm okay. I just gotta take these pills every day and they said I'd be okay.

She picks up the bottle of pills from the table and holds it up for Jack to see.

CLOSE UP ON the bottle label - "DIGITALIS 3mg"

JACK
Why'd you leave your door open?

MRS. MURRAY
I called the super about the door, it must be a dozen times and he keeps saying that he's going to fix it but he never shows up. I usually close it with a piece of duct tape but I guess it just came loose. I wanted to talk to you but I didn't want to make trouble for you again.

JACK
Talk about what?

MRS. MURRAY
Last night. Those thugs came to my door and scared me out of fifty dollars. They said it was a 'donation' to their Firemen Fund. I know it was a shakedown but I didn't even argue. I was so scared, especially after what happened before. I just gave them the money. They said they'll be back next month for more. I didn't know what to do. Did I do the right thing, Jack?

JACK
Yes, you did the only thing that you could do.

MRS. MURRAY
What should I do when they come back?

JACK
I think you have to give them the money again until we can straighten all this out.

MRS. MURRAY
What if I don't have the money?

JACK
See me before they are due to come and I'll try to help you out with the money as best I can.

INT. THE LUNCH BOX - the next day - NOON

Jack is sitting at the counter and points to his cup.

JACK
Charlie, give me a little more. Have those bums that usually sit at that table over there, been here already?

Charlie fills Jack's cup, walks around to the table at the gang's booth and starts to wipe it down as he answers.

CHARLIE 
(while continuing to clean)
Yeah! They always show up about ten and leave about eleven or twelve. They just left. Not only do they not pay the bill, they always leave a mess. Spill shit all over the place. Don't even put the lid back on the sugar.

Charlie points to the empty coffee cups on the table. Jack turns on his stool to look.

CHARLIE (CONT'D) 
(with disgust)
Look at this! That DS guy uses half the sugar on the table every time and most of it just lays on the bottom of the cup anyway.

JACK
They come here every day?

CHARLIE
Sure do. Like clockwork. Come here and steal breakfast from me and then go home and get high, sleep it off and be ready for their 'Night Ride' as the call it.

Jack finishes his coffee and stands up ready to leave.

JACK
See ya tomorrow, Charlie.

CHARLIE
Guess you're a regular now huh, Jack?

JACK 
(smiling)
I like your coffee and even better I pay the tab.

Jack leaves with Charlie still cleaning up.

Chapter 8
Talk is Cheap



INT. JACK'S BUILDING HALLWAY - the next day - LATE MORNING

Jack is in the stairway approaching Mrs. Murray's door - it is still taped shut. He cracks the door and softly whispers in.

JACK 
(softly)
Anybody home? 

He calls softly again.

JACK
(softly) 
Mrs. Murray?

Getting no answer he then steps into the apartment. The cat is cowering in the corner and hissing.
Jack walks into the kitchen and looks around. He spies the medicine bottle on the counter, the one that she had shown him.

CLOSE UP - A MEDICINE BOTTLE IS ON THE COUNTER - LABELED "DIGITALIS"

Jack stares at the bottle. He carefully opens the pill bottle. It is nearly filled. He dumps several pills from the bottle and puts them in his pocket then replaces the bottle on the counter. He leaves the apartment and replaces the tape on the door.

EXT. THE BENCH - that AFTERNOON

Jack, Hal and Petey are talking. Jack is puffing on his cigar and looking straight ahead. He suddenly stops and turns to Petey.

JACK
Ever kill anybody, Petey?

Petey is a bit startled by Jack's question. He then replies.

PETEY
You I know did. Larry told you about me in Nam.

JACK
What did you think when you did it?

PETEY
Didn't think, just did it? It was what I was there for. Kill them or they kill you. I never killed anybody up close and personal, it was always a guy off in the distance. I never saw the look in his eyes when he got shot. Never heard him scream. None of it. It was kinda like being at the boardwalk except the targets were shootin' back at ya. 

JACK
How did it make you feel? Afterwards, I mean?

PETEY
Not too good. Later I felt bad for those guys. They were forced into that whole thing just like me but like I said before, it was them or me and I had to do what I had to do.

JACK
So, your back was against the wall and there was no other way out, right? 

PETEY
Yeah, Jack, that's right.

JACK
What about you Hal?

HAL
Never killed nobody. Killed a dog once, my dog. I loved that Sammy. He was almost human to me. That was about the closest I ever come to killin' a person.


JACK
How come you killed him?
									FLASHBACK BEGINS:

HAL (O.S.)
He got real sick and in those days, back in my town, the only sick animals that ever saw a vet was the ones that were worth money, like farm stock. Pets, like dogs and cats, they got the bullet and he was my dog so I had the job of shootin' him. Felt pretty terrible about it but it was kinda like Petey in Nam. It was my job and I had ta do it.

INT. HAL'S BOYHOOD HOME - DAY

Hal as a child is seated on an old, rickety, wooden chair. Tears are streaming down his face. The camera pulls back to reveal a rifle across his lap and his dog lying by his side.
After a few seconds, Hal stands and slowly walks to the door with the dog following. They leave and close the door. The camera stays on the door for a few seconds before a gun shot
is heard.  



									FLASHBACK ENDS:

JACK
Do you think you could ever kill a person?

HAL
Maybe, if I had to, but I'm not real sure. I don't think anybody that's never done it could really say. They might say 'Oh yeah, sure', but when the time comes, it might be a whole different story.

JACK
You're right!

PETEY
What about you, Jack?

JACK
Don't know if I could but I think I'd like to be able to if I really had to.

HAL
What are you gettin' at Jack, with all this talking about killin'?

JACK 
(hesitating)
The other day, when those bums came to my house and hustled me, I thought I could have easily killed all of them if I had the chance. Then, when I saw you yesterday Hal and you told me what they did to you, I knew I could and would if I had the chance. I'm not talking about killing people here; I'm talking about exterminating rats and cockroaches. I look it as being just like Terminix or RotoRooter and cleaning out the bugs and sewer rats.  
(a beat) 
I guess I'm kinda letting my imagination run away with me.

PETEY
And I guess, you're trying to see if Hal and me would go along with you if you really decided to do something. Right?

JACK
Yeah, I guess so.

HAL
Count me out. I can't be murderin' nobody.

JACK
To be honest, I don't know if I could either in spite of all my bull shit. Probably when it came right down to it I wouldn't be able to.

HAL 
Guess we're just gonna have to go on living like animals then and get used to the Firemen being the masters and us being the ass lickin' dogs.

Hal pauses and thinks.

HAL (CONT'D
Even if we did wanta do it, how could we anyway?

PETEY
Without getting caught or getting ourselves killed?

JACK
I'm not sure but I have some ideas. Did you ever kill a snake?

HAL
I never did but I saw a lot of 'em get killed when I was a kid down South, Cotton Mouths ya know.

JACK
How'd they do it, Hal? Do ya remember? 

HAL
Yeah, they used to cut the head right off. They used to say that if ya didn't, it wouldn't die. If you did, it would die at sundown.

JACK
Well, that's kinda my idea. We got to cut the head off and then the body of the snake will die. Now how we cut it off is the problem.

HAL
What do you mean, 'cut off the head'?

JACK
I mean, if we get rid of the boss man.

HAL
Yeah but that didn't happen when Sandman disappeared? DS just stepped in and started the same old shit goin' again as smooth as could be.

JACK
Maybe this time it's gotta be more dramatic. Something to really scare the piss outta them.

PETEY
So what you're saying Jack, is we should get rid of DS and do it so it makes it clear that the others will be next if they don't quit?

JACK
You got it Petey.

HAL
But how? 

JACK
I'm not sure but I've got some ideas.

A brief silence.

PETEY
How about we send an anonymous threat. Maybe we can disrupt them, get them suspicious of each other. Maybe we can get them at each other's throats. I'm not so sure it would work but we should give it a try before we start planning on killin' anybody.

JACK 
(With a sigh)
I don't think it'll mean a damn thing but I'm willing to try if that's all you guys want to do. Maybe I'll be wrong and it'll work.

CUT TO:

INT. THE LUNCH BOX - the next day MORNING

Jack is at the counter with his coffee. Charlie is drying some glasses.  A KID walks in.

Kid
Gimme a can of Coke.

Charlie goes to the back room and immediately comes out with the Coke. He hands it to the kid. The kid pays and leaves.

JACK
Hey Charlie, how come the soda cooler is in the back? You always have to keep going back there to get them all the time?

CHARLIE
Used to have it in the front, over there.

Charlie points towards the front door where an outline of where the soda case once stood is still apparent on the floor.

CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Kids used to run in the front door, grab a soda out of the case and run out so I had to move it back there where they can't do that anymore.

JACK 
(a beat)
Where are your boys? That gang of punks?

Charlie looks at the clock.

CHARLIE
Oh they'll be here any minute. Every day, around ten o'clock. Never fails.

Jack sips his coffee. Within seconds four of the Firemen walk in and sit at their usual booth. Boisterous banter comes from the booth. Jack leaves.

EXT. the PLAYGROUND NEAR JACK'S APARTMENT - the next MORNING 9:30

Children are playing in background. Jack appears wearing a fake mustache and old black rimmed glasses. His hair is greased and slicked back and he is unshaven. Jack looks at his watch.

Close up on the watch - it reads 9:30

He approaches a BOY about ten years old who is tossing a ball against a cement wall.

JACK
Son, would you like to make ten dollars for doing me a favor?

The boy answers while continuing to throw and catch the ball.

BOY 
(A snappy tone)
Listen old man, I'm not into gay stuff! Leave me alone!

JACK
No! No! That's not what I mean. All you have to do is take this piece of paper to the Lunch Box down the street.

The boy stops playing and turns to Jack. Jack holds out the note to the boy.

BOY
(cautiously) 
You sure that's it?

JACK
Positive!

The boy timidly accepts the note from Jack.

BOY
Well, okay. What do I gotta do?

JACK
You take this note down to the Lunch Box. Keep it in your pocket. Go inside and ask the guy behind the counter for a soda. Here's the money for the soda. 

Jack hands the kid two dollars.

JACK (CONT'D)
When he goes in the back to get your soda, put this note on the first table from the door, face up. Put the sugar bowl on its corner so it stays there. Be sure he doesn't see you do it. Then come back here for your money.

BOY
That's it?

JACK
That's it kid, ten bucks and a free soda.

The boy takes off running with the note.

DISSOLVE TO:

The boy returns from the Lunch Box. 

BOY 
(Breathlessly from running)
Did it!

JACK
Was anybody in the place?

BOY
Just me and the guy.

JACK
And you put it on the first table like I said?

BOY 
(Smiling broadly)
Sure did!

JACK
Did he see you?

BOY
Not a bit!

Jack hands the kid a ten dollar bill.

BOY (CONT'd) 
(eagerly)
Whenever you want me to hand out any more notes, I'll be right here.

INT. THE LUNCH BOX - THAT AFTERNOON

Charlie is slumped on a stool with his apron clutched in his hand and head drooping. His hair is rustled; his face is reddened; his grease spotted shirt is torn. Jack enters.

JACK
Charlie, what the hell is going on?

CHARLIE
Those same fuckin' punks!

JACK
What happened this time?

CHARLIE 
(Speaking rapidly)
The whole thing was strange. At ten o'clock that same bunch came in, like usual. All of a sudden, one of them, I think it was DS, yells 'What's this shit?'

begin Flashback:

INT. THE LUNCH BOX - EARLIER that morning

The gang enters and sits at their usual booth. Suddenly DS jumps up from the booth waving the piece of paper planted by Jack. He rushes over to Charlie while yelling and holds the note in Charlie's face and grabs him by the front of his shirt. He slaps Charlie across the face and makes him read the note to the gang.

CHARLIE (cont'd) (O.C.)
(Narrating the scene)

He stands up wavin' this piece of paper at me. I didn't know what he was talking about. Then he comes over to me and shoves this note in my face. Then he grabs me by the shirt, pushes me against the wall.

DS 
(yelling)
'Where the fuck did this come from? 

CHARLIE
I don't know.

CHARLIE (O.C.)
That wasn't good enough I guess because he slapped me across the face and said 'Read it so we all can hear it real good Charlie boy'. So I had to read it.

CLOSE UP ON THE NOTE as charlie reads.

CHARLIE (CONT'D) 
(reading the note)
"No more ripping off the people living in this neighborhood. This is your only warning. If you do it again, you and all of your gang will be punished. This is no bullshit! The Grey Army."

End flashback:

int. back at the lunch box 

Charlie continues to explain to Jack.

CHARLIE 
Then he asked me again who wrote the note. I had to tell him all over again that I didn't know. I really don't! To me it sounded like one of those old sixties groups, like the Symbionese Liberation Army or somethin' like that. That's all I could tell him.

JACK 
What did they do then?

CHARLIE 
They sat there and ate like usual, all the time talkin' back and forth about that note, trying to guess where it came from. After about an hour they left.

DISSOLVE TO:

FLASHBACK BEGIN:

The gang begins to leave. As they do, DS takes the note, lights it on fire and throws it on the table.

DS
That's what we think of that shit - when we find out who left it we'll show 'em what punishment really is! You can be sure about that.

They march out of the Lunch Box and slam the door as they leave.

FLASHBACK END: 

Charlie continues to explain to Jack.

CHARLIE
About fifteen minutes later, a kid comes in and says they're going around askin' if anybody knows anything about the note. Then the kid asks me if I remember him coming into the store. I told him 'No, I didn't' and all the kid said is 'Good' and left.

INT. JACK'S APARTMENT -the next day - EARLY MORNING

Jack is sleeping and there is a pounding on his door. He gets up still groggy and goes to the door. 

JACK 
(Though the door)
Who it is?

He peeks through the peephole.

HAL
(Excitedly)
It's Hal, Jack! I came to tell you what happened last night over at my place.

Jack lets him in.

HAL (CONT'D)
The Firemen showed up at each apartment last night. They had a little kid with them and they got people in each apartment to come to the door. Then they asked the kid if any of them was the guy that gave him the note.

JACK 
(Playing dumb)
What note?

HAL
Well, it seems that they got a threatening note at the coffee shop yesterday and the note was delivered by the kid. Now, they want to know who sent the kid.

JACK
So then what?

HAL
The kid couldn't finger anybody. They said fire protection is going up by ten dollars each month for everybody, until they find out who wrote the note. They're going from building to building and I'm guessing they'll be here tonight.

JACK
I really appreciate the information but why did you come over here at this hour to tell me?

HAL
I just had a gut feeling that after our talk the other day you should know. Just a feeling if you know what I mean?

Chapter 9
Action

INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - THAT EVENING

Jack hears apartment doors down the hall being pounded on and brief, muffled conversations at each one after the other. The sound is getting progressively closer as it moves from one door to the next. Soon it is his. He reluctantly cracks opens the door. Three Firemen thugs push the door wide open in his face. The kid who planted the note for him is pushed into the open doorway. One of the thugs immediately points to Jack.

THUG 1
How about this dude?

The boy looks at Jack for a few seconds and then shakes his head and looks downward.

THUG 2 
(snarling)
I'm gettin' a little tired of this shit sonny boy. You best be getting' your memory straight or I'll be beginnin' to think you made all this shit up.

THUG 1
We'll be back next month and save up an extra ten bucks. Insurance premiums are goin' up.

They pull the kid out of the doorway and go to the next apartment. Jack closes the door but can hear the muffled bantering as they move down the hall.

CUT TO:

EXT. the PUBLIC LIBRARY - NEXT MORNING

Jack enters the building.

INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - MINUTES LATER

Jack sits in front a computer screen reading.

Close up - computer screen

THE COMPUTER SCREEN
"Digitoxin toxicity - Oral doses effective after two hours. Lethal dosage 5 to 25 milligrams dependent on body mass."

Int. The lunch box - an hour later

Jack is sitting at the counter with his coffee. Charlie goes into the back room. Jack quickly stuffs several sugar packets from one of the booths into his pocket. He goes back to the counter, finishes his coffee and leaves. 

CUT TO:

INT. JACK'S KITCHEN - THAT SAME DAY- an hour later

Jack is grinding up the pills that he took from Mrs. Murray. He carefully cuts open two sugar packets from the Lunch Box, empties them and pours in the powdered pills. He reseals each with a bit of glue.

INT. THE LUNCH BOX - the next day - EARLY MORNING - 9:30

The place is empty except for Jack and Charlie.

JACK
How's things goin'?

Charlie looks at the clock.

CHARLIE
Same shit! Just waitin' for those pricks to show up as usual.

Charlie disappears into the kitchen. Jack immediately moves to the gang's booth, removes all the sugar packages from the container. He replaces the ones which contain the Digitoxin and goes back to the counter. Minutes later the Firemen enter boisterously and take their seats at the booth.

THUG 1 (DS)
Get your ass out here with the cups, Charlie boy!

Charlie hurries from the kitchen with the cups. Jack watches as DS pours the sugar packets into his coffee and then looks for more.

THUG 2
Hey Charlie man, we's need more sugar out here. I like my coffee like my ladies, hot, black and sweet, if you know what I mean?

Charlie rushes over with more sugar and Jack continues to watch. DS begins to sip the coffee. 

a brief TIME CUT:

Several minutes pass and DS is becoming quieter.

THUG 3 
(Addressing DS)
Hey boy, what's with ya? Ya ain't said shit and ya ain't lookin' that good either.

THUG 1 (DS)
I ain't feelin' so great somehow. I'll be best goin' home and gettin' a little nappy in.

THUG 4
You be needin' some help? 

THUG 1 (DS) 
(Slurring)
Since when does I need help with anything?

DS gets up and walks out unsteadily. Seconds later Jack leaves and follows him.

EXT. THE STREET ON WHICH DS LIVES - a few minutes later

DS is stumbling towards his building. Jack is following across the street at a distance. DS arrives at his apartment building's door, opens it and falls into the doorway. Jack hurries to him.

JACK
Come on man! Let me help you.

DS struggles to his feet with Jack's help and slurs an unintelligible agreement. They move up the stairs to DS's apartment. He struggles with key but finally opens the door. Jack helps him to his bed. Jack stares at the prone, barely conscious man. Jack gets a plastic bag from DS’s kitchen, lifts the man's head and slips the bag over him. DS quivers briefly and then becomes lifeless. Jack rolls the body over and takes a large wad of bills from the DS's pocket and removes the bag from his head. He stands and stares at DS's lifeless body for a moment and then sits on a chair next to the bed still staring. Suddenly he lowers his head into to his hands. The priest's words are heard as he sits.

PRIEST (O.C.)
Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.

Jack slowly arises and leaves with DS's keys locking the door behind him.

INT. A CHURCH CONFESSIONAL - LATER THAT AFTERNOON.

Jack is sitting in a pew waiting to enter the confessional. He is kneeling with hands folded and head hanging. The door of the confessional opens, the previous confessor leaves and Jack immediately enters.

JACK 
(in a slow, hesitating voice)
Bless me Father for I have sinned. It has been five years since my last confession. I have...

JACK (CONT'D) 
(a long beat)
I have....
(another long beat)

Priest
Our Lord forgives all no matter how great the sin if the sinner is truly repentant.

JACK 
(a beat)
And if the sin is just?

PRIEST
That is for God to decide but first you must confess and repent in order to receive absolution. 

Another silence and Jack suddenly arises and leaves the confessional.

INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - THAT EVENING.

Jack is on the phone.

JACK 
(on the phone)
Petey - This is Jack. I'd like to do a little fishing tomorrow up at Larry's. What do you think? 

PETEY 
(on the phone and hesitatingly)
Are going to bring the bait again like last time?

JACK 
(on the phone)
I am. I've got to use it before it goes bad on me.

PETEY 
(on the phone and very hesitating)
Okay I guess we'll go then. I'll call Larry and I'll pick you up at about nine o'clock.

JACK
(on the phone)
No Petey, let's make it about five so we can get the bait into the trunk without a problem.

PETEY 
(on the phone)
Sure Jack, five it is.

INT. DS'S APARTMENT BUILDING- EARLY MORNING

Jack and Petey are dragging a piece of old carpeting up the stairs to DS's apartment.

PETEY
What's this rug for?

JACK
I grabbed it out of the garbage yesterday. It's exactly what we need. You'll see.

As they enter the bedroom Petey spies the corpse.

PETEY 
(shocked)
Holy shit Jack - you really did it!

JACK
Come on Petey! You had to know what I was talking about on the phone.

PETEY
Yeah- You're right, I did know but actually seeing it is somethin' else.

JACK
Let's get this over with.

They unroll the rug next to DS in the bed. It contains plastic bags and cord. They slide the corpse into the bag, roll it off the bed onto the rug, wrap it and tie it tightly. They quietly slide the rug with the body in it down the stairs and put it in Petey's trunk. With some pushing and shoving it just fits.

EXT. PETEY'S CAR - on the way to LARRY's - later that MORNING

PETEY
I never thought you would do it. I know you talked about it and I know you were plenty pissed but I never thought you would do it.

JACK
Neither did I. But, you know what, now that it's done, I'm glad! 

PETEY
What kinda pushed you over the edge Jack? 

JACK
I was thinking about it for a long time somebody had to do something. My mother always told me that if you want the right to complain then you have to earn it by being willing to do something to change things. I think this is going to change things a lot! (A long pause) You know, I heard the story about the old lady over on Beech Street the other day and I think that kind of did it too.

PETEY
You mean about the dog? I never got the whole story? 

JACK
These guys were going around the buildings lookin' to find out about that note. When they came into her place, her dog nipped one of them, a little dog, the size of a mouse. So the prick took the dog and threw it out of the third floor window. When the old lady started screaming and crying they took her over to the window and hung her half way out and threatened to throw her out too if she didn't stop yelling. When I heard that, it was the final straw. I knew what I had to do and I did it.

PETEY
What was it like Jack? I mean killin' him?

JACK
You should know. Larry said you killed a shit load in Nam.

PETEY
But I mean, up close and personal like you did. I told you, I never really saw the guys I killed up close.

JACK
You know what Petey! (A sigh) It wasn't that bad after all. I guess it was because I hated the son of bitch so much for what he was doing that it was like killing a mosquito. After it's squashed, you've done a service, not a sin. You know that you and nobody else is ever going to be bitten by that bastard again.

Chapter 10
Crazy Shit



EXT. LARRY'S FRONT PORCH - LATE MORNING

Jack and Petey arrive with the rug wrapped body in the trunk. Larry is sitting with a beer and cigar and Rusty lying next to him as usual.

LARRY
Good to see you boys again. How was the ride up?

PETEY
I would have liked it better if we didn't have our passenger ridin' shotgun in the trunk.

LARRY 
(Grinning)
Look at it this way. You guys are like the sanitation department for your neighborhood. You're just pickin' up the garbage and takin' it to the landfill. Helpin' to keep the streets clean. Who could argue with that? How about you Jack? Things okay by you?

JACK 
(Snidely)
Yeah! Great!

LARRY
I know what you mean. I know what you mean.

Larry taps on the trunk deck lid.

LARRY (CONT'D)
Let's get to it. Drive on down to the garage and let's get started.

Ext. LARRY's garage - minutes later

DS's naked body has been laid out on the plywood sheet. Suddenly Jack spies a ring on the corpse's finger glittering in the sun. 

CLOSE UP - A SMALL GOLD PINKY RING ON DS'S swollen FINGER.

JACK
Wait a minute! Let me get that ring off his finger.

Jack reaches towards the ring. Larry pushes Jack away and pulls out a pocket knife.

JACK
What are you doing?

LARRY
You don't think you're gonna just pull that thing off with his finger swelled up like that do ya? Let me show ya how it's done. I got some practice with this kinda stuff.

Larry proceeds to cut off the finger with the ring still on it. He tears a strip from DS's discarded shirt, wraps the finger and hands it to Jack. Blood is oozing through the cloth. Jack takes it timidly.

JACK
What the hell am I going to do with this?

LARRY
Let me tell you a story. Back in Nam, I still remember the day, August fifth, nineteen sixty-eight, we was out in the bush like usual. There was about ten of us, marchin' through the jungle with snakes, bugs and of course, the Cong. All of a sudden, one of our guys goes down.

FLASHBACK BEGIN:

EXT. JUNGLE IN VIETNAM - DUSK

A platoon is moving through thick jungle. A sniper is firing on the soldiers. Several soldiers immediately go down. The others scurry for cover and more are shot. A soldier is shot and falls on top of Larry who is lying prone. There is screaming shooting.

LARRY (CONT'D) (O.C.) 
(Narrating the scene)
He got it right through the head. The guy behind me stood up to get a look at where the shootin' was comin' from and pop he got one too and he fell right on top of me. I just stayed there and heard a bunch more shots and lots of screams.

A Cong soldier shimmies down a tree with his gun in hand. As he gets halfway down Larry shots him and he falls.

	LARRY (CONT'D) (O.C.) 
(Narrating the scene)
Then after a while, all was quiet and I see this Cong slidin' down a tree about ten yards away. I knew it was him. I took a bead on him and bang got him, like shootin' a squirrel out of a tree. It was quiet some more and I rolled out from underneath the guy that fell on me. I guess he saved me cause he took a bunch of bullets in the back while he was layin' on top of me.

Larry stands up and warily goes to see some of the other fallen soldiers. He finds only his friend KNOTSY barely alive and radios for help.

LARRY (CONT'D) (O.C.) 
(Narrating the scene)
Anyways, I looked around and found all the other guys. Only one was alive and I called us in so they'd send a chopper for us or what was left of us.

Larry walks over to and hovers over the dead Cong with a knife in his hand. An arriving helicopter is heard in the distance. He cuts off the dead man's ear and trigger finger.

LARRY (CONT'D) (O.C.) 
(Narrating the scene)
Then, I went over to the Cong. I couldn't just leave him there without some revenge after what he did, so I cut his trigger finger off and shoved it in my pocket. I started to walk away and then I stopped and went back cut off one of his ears and stuffed that in my pocket too.

FLASHBACK END: 

EXT. back AT THE garage - minutes later

Larry takes out his wallet, removes a thin, black, wrinkly object encased in plastic.

CLOSE UP OF THE OBJECT.

LARRY
 When I got back to base, I cut the bone out, flattened it out and dried it. Then I laminated it in plastic so I could keep it, kinda like the Indians in South America do with those shrunken heads, I guess. Here it is.

He thrusts the encased finger towards Jack.

PETEY
Why in Christ's name did you do that?

LARRY
Revenge, Petey! Revenge, I guess! Every time I look at it, I feel like I'm getting' a little even with that prick for killin' all my guys. It might be kinda nutty but it makes me feel better.

Larry pauses and stares for a moment.

LARRY (COnT'D)
When I got home from Nam I started havin' what the shrinks called 'episodes'. I call 'em 'bein' scared shitless, spells comin' outta nowhere. When I'm alone at night, I lay in bed and the whole thing happens all over again. I'm back there in that jungle and I can see, hear, feel and smell every minute of that day like it's happenin' all over again. Maybe it's because I can't never get rid of the fear and hate deep down. It's so strong that it got stuck inside me.

JACK
Did you ever talk to anybody about it - like a doctor I mean?

LARRY
I did some talkin' about it with the shrinks down at the VA a few years ago but that didn't help much. I guess they just thought I was nuts and that was it. They put a label on me, PTSD they called me. I suppose once they put a label on ya they figure they did their job, case closed, ya know what I mean? They gave me some pills but I stopped takin' them. They gave me headaches.

Larry pauses again and looks at the ground.

LARRY (COnT'D)
I did a shit load over there and when I came back too. You know, pot, acid, chipped a little horse and of lots of Jack D. I thought that might have somethin' to do with all this crazy shit that was goin' on with me. I went stone cold sober a few years back. I lasted more than six months but it didn't do no good. They still came back.

Larry snaps out of his trance-like conversation.

JACK 
(In a timid voice)
What happened to the ear? Did you keep that too?

LARRY
No, I gave it to the other guy that was with me, Knotsy and he kept it just like me. We usta call him Knotsy cause he always said he had a knot in his stomach from the day he landed in Nam. Knotsy and me, we were pretty good buds the whole time in Nam, especially after that day with the Cong. Shit, we were the only two guys left of our original bunch. After we got out of that shit hole and back to the States we lost touch. Maybe a Christmas card but that was about it.
	
FLASHBACK BEGIN:

INT. A LOCAL BAR - EVENING

Larry and KNOTSY meet joyfully. They are then seen drinking and laughing at the bar. Knotsy's face is never clearly shown in any of these scenes.

LARRY (CONT'D) (O.C.)
(Narrating)
Then one day, about ten years after we was out, he calls me out of the blue and we got together again for a couple of drinks and bullshit. He said he was doin' pretty good, makin' a lot of bucks. He never really said exactly what he was doin' but it was workin' out alright. Then just before we split, he pulled out his wallet and shows me. 

CLOSE UP - THE CONG'S EAR

The encased ear is shown to Larry.

LARRY (CONT'D) (O.C.)
It's the ear all laminated in plastic like mine. He said, he figures that was his good luck charm and without it he would never be doin' as good as he was. When we was talkin', I told him about wantin' to by this fish farm and how I didn't know if I could swing it. I never saw or talked to him again.

CUT TO:

INT. - THE LOCAL POST OFFICE IN FRONT OF THE MAILBOXES - MORNING

Larry opens an envelope and finds the check and the note from Knotsy. 

LARRY (CONT'D) (O.C.) 
(Narrating the scene)
About a month later, I got a check in the mail for ten grand with a note that says 'Good luck fishing. Some money for bait - Knotsy'. That's about thirty or forty thou today. The envelope had no return address and I never heard from him again. I cashed the check and that's how "Larry's Fishin' Hole' got started.

FLASHBACK END: 

PETEY
Man, that's some story Larry! And you never saw the guy again?

LARRY
Nope! Never! Never even got to thank him.

Jack holds up the blood soaked rag containing the finger.

JACK
So why are you giving me this?

LARRY
If I was you, I'd get it back to that Fireman bunch. I'm pretty sure that would back 'em off big time.

JACK
You know Larry, I think you're right on.

Jack shoves the rag with the finger into his pocket.

INT. THE LUNCH BOX -the next day - MORNING - 9:30

Jack is at the counter with his coffee. When Charlie goes to the kitchen Jack hurriedly places something in the sugar bowl. Within minutes the Firemen gang arrives boisterously and sits in their usual booth. Suddenly screams erupt and they all pile over each other jumping from the booth.

THUG 1 
(Screaming)
Holy fuckin' shit!

THUG 2 
(shouting)
What the fuck it that?

Hearing the uproar Charlie rushes from the kitchen.

CHARLIE 
(shouting)
Holy shit!

The sugar bowl is overturned and the severed finger is lying on the table with a Christmas tag attached to the ring.

CLOSE UP ON THE TAG 

The tag
'Merry Christmas - now back off - The Grey Army'.

Jack smiles faintly and slowly turns on his stool. He arises and walks out.

Chapter 11
A Surprise Visitor



INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - A WEEK LATER - EVENING.

A sharp knock at Jack's door. He looks through the peephole. Jack recognizes DFN (a Firemen gang member) who is at the door.

JACK 
(through the door)
What do you want?

DFN
 I just wanna talk, Man - just talk - nothin' else. Just talk! I come in peace Pale Face! I 
ain't got no gun or nothin', I come in peace Bro! 

JACK 
(through the door)
Talk about what?

DFN
Well, if ya open this door I'll tell ya. Can't be talkin' to no closed door out here.

JACK 
(through the door)
Take off your shirt.

DFN
What!

JACK 
(through the door)
Take off your shirt and turn your pockets inside out and turn around.

DFN 
(Scowling)
Okay!

Jack goes to the kitchen, gets a large knife, returns and cautiously cracks open the door.

DFN
Can I put my duds back on now, Man?

JACK
Okay.

DFN puts his shirt back on. Jack warily opens the door and DFN enters.

DFN
You don't be needin' that knife. I told ya I come in peace.

Jack warily lowers the knife by his side. 

JACK
So what's this all about?

DFN
I wanna talk, about what happened to DS.

JACK
I don't know what you're talking about. What happened and who is DS?

DFN
Come on Man, you don't have ta bullshit me. I know you know what happened. I saw ya.

JACK
What the hell are you talking about? Saw what?

DFN
You know god damn well. Didn't I just say don't bullshit me? 

JACK
Alright, let me hear what you think you know. 

DFN
Man, I don't think I know, I know! Here's how it goes. Ya know the kid that ya sent with that note down to the Box. He was my little nephew and he knew damn well who you was, even with that shitty disguise ya was wearin'. I told him not to tell anybody that he knew ya. Then, I told him to watch ya, real careful like. He saw ya when ya carried DS up to his place. Now, I don't know how DS got all fucked up like he was, but my boy did see ya carry him up. Then, after that he saw ya leave. He came and got me. The next afternoon I went to his place. I jimmied the lock and went in and guess what? No DS! Never did see him since, so what does that make me think? Makes me think, you had somethin' to do with him goin' disappeared. What would you think if you was me?

JACK
If that's what you think and that's what you know, how come you never told the rest of your gang? If you did I'm sure they would have come for me by now?
DFN: I hated that mother fucker. I just wished somebody woulda done him sooner. He raped my little sister when she was eleven.  She told me about it. She wouldn't tell anybody else cause he said he'd kill her and everybody else if she told and I'm sure he woulda. After a while, he kinda figured out that I knew what he done maybe cause of the way I was always lookin' at him. I couldn't help but keepin' from starin' at him all the time. Guess he just sensed I knew from that. Then, he put that DFN - 'Dumb Fuckin' Nigger' tag on me. I suppose that was to make the rest of 'em think I was stupid and anything I said couldn't be true, just in case I went and told about what he done. 

JACK
What's your real name?

DFN
Clyde, Clyde Johnson.

JACK
Why did you stay in the gang then? 

CLYDE
You just don't quit. Quit them and you quit livin'. 

JACK
So why are you here talking to me now then? 

CLYDE
Well, I gotta give you some stars. After two of our guys disappeared and we got the two notes, you scared everybody out. It's one thing when you can see people comin' up on ya and another when it comes outta nowhere. And I gotta tell ya, when DS's dead ass finger jumped outta that sugar bowl, that was tops! Man that really scared the shit outta everybody including me. That was some great shit ya did. Guys where startin' ta talk ghost and spook shit. It freaked 'em all out. They were all pissin' in their pants. Me, of course didn't believe any of that silly shit cause like I told you, I knew what I knew. But, this was my chance to get out and I took it. I told 'em all that I thought it was some kind spirit stuff and I was leavin' and not one of 'em tried to stop me or even said any bad shit about me. They was all more scared than I said I was.

JACK
So why are you here now? 

CLYDE
I know DS always carried lots of cash around with him. Like I mean a stack of bennies, maybe a few grand. I'm sure he musta had it with him. I think a piece of that should be mine, seein' as I kinda saved ya a lotta hurt. I'm here to get it.

JACK
What makes you think I've got it?

CLYDE 
(Smirking)
What makes me think ya don't?
 
Jack pauses and waits for Clyde to continue but Clyde is silent. Jack sighs. 

JACK
You have to give me a little more time. I don't have it right here.

CLYDE
I don't really believe ya but I'm gonna give ya a little more but not much. I'll be back tomorrow and don't think ya be gettin' over on me. Just because I had that DNF tag hung on me don't mean it's true, cause it ain't.

Clyde leaves. Jack hesitates and goes to the refrigerator and takes out a plastic bag from the back. 

He opens it revealing the money he took from DS.

CLOSE UP - A STACK OF MONEY IN THE BAG.

Jack closes the bag, puts in back in the freezer and goes to the living room. He turns on the TV and sits in a daze staring at it. The TV screen is showing a news ANNOUNCER.

The tv screen is shown as JACK watches

ANNOUNCER
James Wheeler has been released from prison after serving six months of his one and a half year sentence. He pleaded guilty to malfeasance and embezzlement in the collapse of Tyron Industries early last year. The failure of Tyron cost thousands their jobs and their life savings.

A picture of the building where WHEELER gets out of a limo is shown. The number and street sign on the entrance of the building is shown as the announcer continues speaking. 

ANNOUNCER (continuing)
Mr. Wheeler left Tacomy State Prison without comment. He is still suspected of depositing millions in off shore accounts, hidden from attack by creditors and pension fund officials.

Jack still seated before the TV.

JACK 
(Muttering to himself)
Fucking six months after ruining hundreds of lives! 

EXT. JACK IS RIDING ON A BUS - MORNING

Jack gets off the bus and sits in a park across from Wheeler's building. Time passes several people are seen to enter and leave the building. Soon Wheeler emerges to walk his dog. He disappears down the adjacent street. Jack arises and walks towards the bus stop heading for home.

Chapter 12
A Plan 


INT. JACK'S APARTMENT the next day - MORNING

A knock at the door. Clyde is at the door. Jack again warily cracks the door open leaving the chain latch in place.

CLYDE
I come for my money, Man. I sure hope you got it.

JACK
Yeah, I got it. One minute.

Jack unlatches the door and goes to the kitchen. He returns to find Clyde pointing a gun at him.

JACK 
(Startled)
Hey, what the fuck is going on here? 

CLYDE
Wanted to make sure you're comin' back with the cash and nothing' else.

Jack hands him some money. Clyde lowers the gun and quickly counts it.

CLYDE (CONT'D)
Forty two hundred sounds about right. I'm sure you kept a little for yourself but that's okay by me, as long as I got mine. I'm no hog.

He turns to leave.

JACK
Wait a minute! Wanta make some real money, real easy? 
 
Clyde slowly turns back towards Jack.

JACK (CONT'D)
Come on in the kitchen and have a beer and I'll tell you how.

Jack and Clyde go into the kitchen. Jack gets the beer from the refrigerator and they sit at the table.

JACK (cont'd)
Did you ever hear of James Wheeler?  

CLYDE
Was I supposed to?

JACK
How about Tyron?

CLYDE
Never did. Never heard of neither one.

JACK
I used to work for Tyron. Had a pretty good job. Then one day, the whole company collapsed. My job, my pension, everything, right down the shit can. The guy who ran the company was this James Wheeler. They charged him with embezzlement. The word was that he'd salted away a bunch of cash off shore but the Feds could never find it. He kept saying that when Tyron went down, he lost his ass too. In the end they got him on some little shit and he only got a year and a half. He didn't even do that. They paroled him early!

CLYDE
Some shit! 

JACK
I saw him on TV when he got released. He lives over in the city and I've been over there a bunch of times doin' some surveillance. I know he's got the money, I just know it and I got a plan to get it, or at least a good amount of it.

CLYDE
I like the sound of all that money but so where do I come in to this? 

JACK
Well, it's not only you; it's your little nephew too. You see, Wheeler's got this dog. When I worked there everybody said he liked the dog more than his old lady. He used to bring the dog to work with him on a regular basis. He had the dog with him when he interviewed people for jobs or promotions. The word was that if the dog didn't take to the guy right away, the guy didn't have a chance of getting the job. I guess he figured the dog had ESP or something. He's in love with the fucking dog, so my plan is to dognap the dog and ransom him back to Wheeler. If he comes up with the money, then we can be pretty sure that he's got more money squirreled away somewhere. If not, then we can be sure that he's on the level about being broke because like I said, he'd do anything for that mutt. If he does have the money, the next step will be to figure out how to get more of it from him.

CLYDE
And how do you plan to do that? 

JACK
I'm not sure yet but I have some ideas.

CLYDE
Let me get to Morris. He'll do whatever I say so it won't be any problem.

JACK
Who's Morris? 

CLYDE
He's my little nephew. That's his name. He's a pretty smart little shit. He'll catch on real quick.

EXT. IN THE PARK IN THE FRONT OF WHEELER'S BUILDING

Jack and MORRIS are sitting on a park bench across the street from Wheeler's building waiting for him to walk his dog. Morris is playing a video game. Wheeler exits the building with the dog.

JACK
Okay kid let's go.

Morris immediately leaves Jack and causally walks up to Wheeler. He begins to make a fuss over the dog.

MORRIS
Oh mister, what a cute little doggie. Can I pet him? 

WHEELER 
(smiling broadly)
Sure Sonny. He likes being petted.

MORRIS
I sure wish I had a dog like him. What's his name?

WHEELER
He's Sparky. And what's your name sonny?

MORRIS
I'm Morris.

Morris continues to pet the dog without looking up.

MORRIS (cont'd)
That's a cool name. I like Sparky. Can I come and see him again tomorrow? 

WHEELER
I think Sparky likes you too. See his tail going? I'm sure he wants to see you again tomorrow too. Sparky and I will be here the same time tomorrow.

MORRIS (CONT'D)
Me too.

Wheeler walks away. Morris returns to Jack. They both then leave for home.

EXT. IN FRONT OF WHEELER'S BUILDING -the next MORNING

Wheeler exits the building with Sparky. Morris approaches and begins to pet the dog. Suddenly he pulls out a pair of cutting pliers and snips the leash, picks up the dog and runs. Wheeler is momentarily stunned. 

WHEELER 
(shouting in panic)
No! Come back! Come back!

He then starts to chase Morris. He is nearly hit by a passing car as he runs across the street. After a short run into the park he stops and is breathing heavily. He sees Morris carrying Sparky, fade into the park.

EXT. AN ISOLATED PART OF THE PARK - A FEW MINUTES LATER.

Morris (out of breath) brings Sparky to Jack who tapes the dog's mouth and feet. He takes a can of ether (spray starter) from the roller bag he has brought with him. He sprays some on a rag. He covers Sparky's nose with the rag. The dog soon lies still. He puts Sparky into the roller luggage bag. They leave for the bus to go home.

INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - THAT AFTERNOON.

Jack and Morris are sitting with the luggage containing the dog in front of them. Jack opens the bag. Sparky is not moving. He untapes the dog's mouth. Its jaw drops open and the tongue protrudes. Jack looks up at Morris with a solemn stare. Morris immediately realizes the dog has died.  

MORRIS 
(Screaming and sobbing)
He's dead! Sparky's dead! You killed him!

JACK 
(soothingly)
Hey kid, we didn't mean to do it. It just happened. It was an accident!

MORRIS 
(still crying)
I know but I loved Sparky and I even thought if Mr. Wheeler wouldn't buy him back, I coulda kept him. I thought about that a lot.

JACK
I know kid but there's nothing that we can do now. We just gotta keep doing what we planned. We sure don't want Sparky's death to be for nothing, do we? Now go get your uncle. I want to talk with him.

DISSOLVE TO:

Clyde arrives at Jack's apartment. He sees the dog lying on the floor next to the luggage.

CLYDE 
(excitedly)
What the fuck are we gonna do now?

JACK
I say we go through with the whole thing as planned. We don't have to say shit about the dog being dead and he won't know until it's time for us to get the money.

CLYDE
What's gonna happen then? 

JACK
Who knows and who cares? We got the money then and its game over. We'll send the kid with this note tomorrow then, right? 

Jack shows Clyde the note he has prepared. Clyde looks at the note and slowly reads it aloud in a low voice.

CLOSE UP - NOTe

CLYDE (O.C.)
"If you want your dog back, be at Winter Park, in the woods at the edge of the ball field at 7 on Wednesday night. Bring $10K. I'll bring the dog, a can of gasoline and a match just in case you don't show up or don't come alone or don't bring the money."

Clyde looks up from the note.

CLYDE
Do you really think this is gonna work?

JACK
I won't have written it if I didn't.

EXT. THE FRONT OF WHEELER'S BUILDING - later that afternoon.

A doorman is stationed at the entrance. Morris warily walks up to the doorman. 

MORRIS
This is for Mr. Wheeler.

He hands the note to the doorman and quickly runs away. 

EXT. WINTER'S PARK -wednesday EVENING - dark and LIGHTLY RAINING

Jack and Clyde await Wheeler who soon arrives. They are under some trees at the edge of the park.

JACK 
(Whispering to Clyde)
It's Wheeler! 
(Then in a low shout) 
Wheeler! Is that you?

WHEELER
Yes.

JACK
Did you bring it?

WHEELER
No!

CLYDE 
(Excitedly)
No! How do you think you're gonna get your fuckin' dog back then? I hope this ain't no trick. If it is, we're gonna have a hot dog roast right here and now.

Clyde pulls a lighter from his pocket and lights it. Wheeler sees the lighter through the darkness.

WHEELER 
(In panic)
No trick. I just don't have the money. Don't! Please don't!

JACK
What about all that money that you hid?

WHEELER 
(anxiously)
I never had any money hidden. That was media bullshit. It sells papers like the truth never could. I lost my ass like everybody else. The only ones that got anything out of that whole deal were the lawyers. They picked the bones clean. I brought eight hundred with me. That's all I could come up with. That's all I've got.

CLYDE
How is it you're livin' in a fancy building with a doorman and all, if you ain't got no money?

WHEELER
That's no fancy building. The elevator doesn't even work. It's been broken for a month now and the doorman, he's no doorman. He's a rent-a-cop. He's only been there since I moved in. I've had a couple of death threats by people that think I screwed them. The guy who owns the building is a friend of mine and he hired a cop to give me security until the whole thing blows over. So what about Sparky? Will you give him to me? Here's the eight hundred bucks.

A brief silence fills the air as Wheeler holds the money out in front of him.

WHEELER (CONT'D)
Listen! Just give him to me and I'll try to get some more money, honest! Just take this now, give him to me and tell me where to leave the next money when I get it. I'll leave it, I swear.

CLYDE 
(whispering to Jack)
Come on Man, you may as well tell him.

Jack says nothing.

CLYDE
Come on man, tell 'em.

More silence.

CLYDE 
(Impatiently shouting)
Okay, the fuckin' dog's dead!

A brief silence and Wheeler mournfully screams.

WHEELER
Sparky's dead!

JACK
Listen, we didn't mean to hurt him.
Wheeler pulls out a knife and rushes towards Jack and Clyde. Wheeler is slashing at Jack but is missing.

WHEELER 
(shouting)
You mother fuckers killed my Sparky!

Clyde instinctively pulls out his gun and shoots Wheeler dead. Wheeler is lying in a puddle, still and bleeding.

JACK 
(nervously)
I think you killed him.

CLYDE
Yeah, he's dead okay. I didn't have any choice. If I didn't shoot him he woulda sliced you right up. The man just went crazy. I saved you. If it wasn't for me, you'd be the guy layin' there in that mud.

JACK 
(In disgust)
All this shit and all he had was a lousy eight hundred bucks. What the fuck are we going to do now? 

CLYDE
We can't just leave him here.

JACK
Why not? 

CLYDE
Look, if we leave him, they'll start lookin' for who killed him right away.

JACK
So what?

CLYDE
How many guys I seen think they'd never get caught and they still got tagged? If we get rid of him, the cops will probably think he just left town with the money he stashed away and they'll be lookin' for him, not us. They might even be lookin' for him in some foreign country cause everybody thinks that's where he hid the cash. If they never find the body, they won't never even know he's dead. They'll never be lookin' for who did it.

JACK
Clyde, for a guy who they called dumb, I have to say, you make a lot of sense.

CLYDE
Now I don't know how you did it but you must be pretty good at getting rid of dead people. I never did see DS again after you got done with him. Let's pull him over here and cover him up a little brush just in case somebody happens by.

They drag the body under a pine tree and cover it with some wet leaves and sticks. Jack takes out his phone.

JACK 
(on the phone)
Petey - It's me Jack - Listen do you think you can help me out? Can you bring your car and some garbage bags and pick me up over here on Seventy Eighth Street, by the park entrance? 

PETEY (O.C.) 
(on the phone)
What's going on?

JACK 
(on the phone)
I'll explain more when you get here. Just get here.

Jack hangs up the phone.

CLYDE
Is he gonna come?

JACK 
(Confidently)
God damn right he's gonna come. No problem. He's seen me in action and I know he's scared shitless of me. He's gonna do whatever I tell him. You wait here and make sure nobody comes snoopin' by. I'll go meet him. 

EXT. AT THE ROADSIDE IN THE PARK - a half hour later

Petey pulls up. 

JACK
Gimme the bags.

Jack takes the garbage bags from Petey and disappears into the park. He returns moments later.

JACK
Open the trunk.

Petey pops the trunk. The trunk is packed with junk.

JACK
What's all this shit you got in here?  Open the back door!

Clyde appears carrying the bag wrapped body over his shoulder.

JACK
Put him in here! Get in and let's go!

Clyde puts the body in the back seat.

PETEY
What the fuck's going on? What's in the bag?

JACK
We have to take a ride to Larry's tomorrow morning, early.

PETEY
Holy shit! You got to be kiddin'! Not again!

They go back to the back of Petey's building, clean out the car's trunk and stuff Wheeler in.

JACK
See ya in the mornin' light, about six. Call Larry and tell him we're comin'.

Chapter 13
Revenge is bitter


EXT. LARRY'S FRONT PORCH - late afternoon.

Larry and the dog are again sitting on the front porch.

LARRY
I see ya brought me another one of your local pricks. How many more is it going take before they catch on and get the fuck outta town on ya?  I'm guessin' they're a bunch of dumb fucks, slow learners. You're trying to teach 'em but they don't seem to be learnin', right Jack? 

PETEY
It's just not sinkin' in.

LARRY
Let's go inside and have a couple beers before we finish this up. Kinda get our stomachs up for it, if you know what I mean.

TIME CUT:

All three are seated around Larry's table filled with empty beer bottles.

LARRY
When the bullshit flies so does the time. Gonna be dark soon. We gotta take care of this before it gets too dark. Let's go.

They all arise and leave the house.

EXT. LARRY's garage - dusk

The sun is about to set and the landscape is dull grey. Jack and Petey have placed Wheeler's naked body on the plywood. We can see the very dark outline of its shape. His face is not visible in the dim light and his skin color is not apparent. Jack suddenly stares skyward and points. Several crows are seen outlined against the distant, bright sky. They are cawing loudly while sitting in a dead tree. Another crow is being attacked by two of the others.

JACK
What's goin' on with those birds?

LARRY 
(Looking up at the crows)
My mama usta call it holdin' court. I remember seein' that lots of times when I was a kid. Crows, when they think one of 'em screws up they all get together and cackle about it. Kinda like a trial. Then they kick his ass and chase him outta the flock, maybe even kill 'em if he don't get away in time.

PETEY
What do ya think he did?

LARRY
How the fuck would I know? How could I know what's goin' on in a bird's head? I don't even know what's goin' on in my own head half the time. I guess he just pissed some of 'em off. Kinda like people. Sometimes people get pissed and it eats on 'em. All they wanta do is get even no matter what.
(Pause)
Ya know, come to think of it maybe Ma was wrong. Maybe it's not a trial their havin'. Could be more like a lynch mob.

They look away and Larry starts the saw and is ready to start the dissection. Suddenly Larry stops, points to a drop light hanging on the wall and speaks to Jack.

LARRY
Grab that drop light over there. I can't see what the fuck I'm doing here. I don't wants be cuttin' off my own leg.

Jack turns on the light and holds it high, illuminating the Wheeler's body and especially his face.

CLOSE UP - LARRY'S PONDERING, PERPLEXED EXPRESSION.

LARRY
What the fuck is this? This ain't no young punk! What's goin' on here? Look, I was all for helpin' you guys get rid of those little pricks that are terrorizing your neighborhood but I'm not for choppin' up every Tom, Dick and Harry when I don't even know who they are or what for.

PETEY 
(excitedly)
Larry, I didn't know. I thought it was one of the gang like you did.

They both look at Jack.

JACK
Did you ever hear of Tyron and the Tyron collapse? 

LARRY
Can't say as I did. I don't never watch the news. I can't deal with it. Ain't watched it in years.

Larry is staring at Wheeler's face.

CLOSE UP - WHEELER'S FACE AGAIN.

LARRY (cont'd) 
Well, I guess it don't make no never mind, now that he's here we gotta get rid of him.

Larry restarts the saw. 

TIME CUT:

They finish running the body through the grinder have taken it to the pond.

EXT. LARRY'S FISH POND - late evening

Jack is holding a flashlight as Larry throws the final portion of the body's remains into the pond.

LARRY
We gotta burn up the guy's duds. Gimme that flashlight. 

Larry picks up the Wheeler's pants from the pile of his clothes. He shines the light on them and rustles through the pockets. He takes out Wheeler's wallet, looks at it and puts it in his pocket. He then throws the clothing into the burning barrel and sets it on fire. 

Cut to:

EXT. LARRY'S PORCH - an hour  

It is dark except for the dim porch light. All three are sitting with a beer in hand. Larry is shuffling through Wheeler's wallet and inspecting the contents with his flashlight. Jack is staring into space. He lowers his head into his hands.

Close up on JACK.

The priest's voice is heard.

PRIEST (O.C.)
Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord."

PETEY
Jack, are you okay?

Jack lifts his head and relies.

JACK
Yeah sure! Larry - what did you find in the wallet? 

LARRY
Wheeler, James Wheeler! 

JACK
Yeah, that was his name. 

A small, dark, plastic covered item from the wallet is in Larry's hand. Larry is staring at it.

CLOSE UP ON THE ITEM.

After a few seconds, Larry silently arises and goes into the house. The screen door slams. Jack and Petey remain on the porch silently drinking. The screen door slams again as Larry comes back out of the house. A suddenly shotgun blast is heard and Jack is catapulted forward from his chair. Jack is lying on the porch floor with the back of his head blown away.

CLOSE UP - PETEY STUNNED EXPRESSION

Larry is standing with the smoking shot gun lowered by his side.

LARRY
Don't worry Petey, I ain't gonna shoot you.

PETEY 
(shouting fearfully)
Holy shit! You just killed Jack! Right out of the blue like that! Why?

Larry sits in Jack's empty seat with gun still in hand.

LARRY 
(Softly)
I had to. I just had to. 

PETEY 
(in panic)
What the fuck do you mean 'Had to'?

Larry takes the dark, plastic covered object he had taken from Wheeler's wallet out of his pocket and stares at it.

LARRY
Know what this is?

PETEY
Can't really tell. Looks like beef jerky! 

LARRY
It's a Cong's ear. Been in this guy's wallet since sixty-eight when I gave it to him.

PETEY
You mean you knew the guy we just put into the pond? 

LARRY
Knew him? Shit yeah, I knew him! He was Knotsy, my bud from Nam. When we first pulled off the bag, I thought he looked familiar but I ain't seen him in twenty-five years or more so. I didn't really recognize him right away. Jack never did tell me his name so I never put anything together until I pulled his wallet outta his pants pocket and saw his name was Wheeler. That was Knotsy's last name, Wheeler. And then when I found this I knew for sure it was him.

PETEY
So why did you just kill Jack? He couldn't have known Wheeler was your friend Knotsy?

LARRY
Don't know. I guess it was just that old Nam thing. It just came right over me. I just had to.

FLASHBACK BEGIN:

Close up on JACK's face.

JACK's face is seen morphing into a Cong.

Close up on LARRY staring

Close up on JACK's face again.

Jack's face is again seen morphing into a Cong.

LARRY (CONT'D) (O.C.) 
(Narrating)
After I found the ear in Knotsy's wallet I looked up at Jack. It was like Jack, all of a sudden, looked just like that Cong that I shot outta the tree back in Nam. I tried to look away but somethin' was makin' me keep lookin' back at him. Every time I looked back, I was hopin' to see Jack but I just kept seein' that Cong sniper's face. I could smell the jungle, hear the sounds and feel the heat. I just knew that I had to shoot him or that fuckin' Cong would get me and Knotsy too. I had to do it.

FLASHBACK END: 

Larry walks over with his shotgun still in hand and sits by Petey. They continue to sit with silent stares for a while. The shotgun is lying across Larry's lap and still slightly smoking.

FADE TO BLACK:

INT. PETEY'S APARTMENT DOOR - SEVERAL DAYS LATER - MORNING

Clyde is knocking on Petey's apartment door. Petey opens the door and Clyde stands in the doorway.

CLYDE
Petey, I ain't seen Jack around lately. I went over to his place a couple of times but ain't nobody there. Where's Jack?

Petey hesitates and then replies.

PETEY
Jack! 
(a long beat) 
Jack went fishin'.

FADE TO BLACK:

                             END
