Dove & Crow Saga

Author's Preamble for December 17 of 2015.

I have been working on what had previously been titled �The Res Kid� since about 1995 or earlier. I'm not exactly sure. But I recall handing pages of the book where the fire eater was introduced to a classmate on the school bus.  It was intended to be the 3rd book of a series. The second book was penned on paper, hand-written. It was the story of Davik (the grandfather character of the twins) at a young age. I admit many of the early stories I wrote were drek. Incoherent. 

But then I wrote �The intermingling grasses of he veldt danced in the warm breeze.� I really would  like to say this came up in the first draft. Anyhow, many bouts of frustrations later... I had reached my breaking point. I didn't want to kill Bleach but I wanted to write about something else. Someone else.

Although Raven's Feather only appeared as barely a cameo during much of the action, he over-shadowed the main story and made many x-rated events to happen in what was loosely intended for young adults. I originally had dream sequences where Bleach experienced things his brother had done. I then cut those out. 

The strangest mistake was my compulsion to release the book into three parts. Then it went to one parter again. THEN four separate pieces with a completely new name for the saga.  Looking at them again, I think of maybe six instead. But I will try to control myself and show some restraint.  A new and much needed element will be these preambles. 


Cradle of Sin: Part One of the Dove & Crow Saga
Chapter One


I
The grass dances in the warm breeze in celebration, backlit by the waning light of the sun. 
Today is special.
Two young boys had been walking and planned to continue to do so until dusk. One is dressed in black with a black cape while the other is in white with a rainbow cape of many colors. The boy in black raises a hand to the air and points with a smile at something in the distance as it happens. 
The boy in white sees it as well. He frowns deeply.
High above them in the sky an eagle is flying. A smaller bird, a dove, flies too near the eagle which shrieks before snatching at the dove and carrying it off. 
�Reminds me of you,� says the boy in black. He takes a quick jump and begins to hover along the ground at great speed. �Always putting your nose where it doesn't belong!�
Not quite as gifted, the boy in white shouts �Aw, come on, Raven! You know I can't use magic as well as you!� He begins to run. 
Raven calls over his shoulder, �Drop the shrub, Bleach. Maybe you'll run faster!� 
�Its a corniferferer!� shouts back Bleach. �I wanted us to plant it today... together.�
�A coniferous tree blossom!� corrects Raven. 
As the eagle took its meal, the boys watched from a distance then waited until it had finished. Then the eagle flew away, satiated. Raven laughs at something. 
He laughs at something he sees ahead. �Oh, a crow arrived!�
In deed, a lone crow picks at the dying dove. It stands on the dove's broken wing, pinning it down with its crude, reptilian feet. And thus after a long drought, the grasses's thirst is quenched by the blood of a dove.
The crow openly rejoices at the meal, it had arrived to the carnage before the other scavengers; it had even beaten the flies that would have invaded such a prize. 
The crow swallows a morsel, smiling in its own way to the dove's shrieks of pain. "Thought you could soar with eagles, did you?" cajoles the crow. "Apparently old Thoragil didn't agree, eh?" It caws in laughter.
Not yet dead, the dove makes a small sound like that of a crying child.
"Fly, stupid Dove. Fly away. To your worms and play that you so love," says the crow as it is cawing in its crow-laughter. Then it pecks out an eye and swallows it whole. 
The mischievous one tosses a stone, laughing as the crow laughs; in mockery. He usurps it�s mirth for mirth of his own. He is a boy that believes a smile is something to be stolen, not shared or given. 
The stone travels its predictable course, striking the crow a mortal blow and ricochets so that falls at rest in front of his sibling�s feet. The throw is a marvel, calculated with cruel precision.
A third witness, their elder, suppresses a smile before his cracked lips manage to form it upon his face. Now is a time for discipline, not pride. A teacher doth not praise what he wishes to declaim. What remains of the crow looks rather like an ink spill. 
The boy in white does not smile either, in fact a single tear shimmers its way down his cheek.
The weepy one stares at what brother had just killed. He stands slump-shouldered, as if carrying the burden of grief were it a physical weight upon his shoulders; a cross he has borne many times throughout his young life. 
The wretched brother tosses the weepy one�s h
air and stomps the crippled crow to death; grinding its bones into powder. 
The kinder brother sighs. He gingerly lifts the bleeding husk of the once flighty dove into his arms and holds it against his chest. 
His heart beats softly in his chest while the dove�s is stilled within its breast. He kisses it. His hands and shirt and lips are stained the same pink from the crimson of the dove�s blood. 

He spits the small drops out with a grimace, ignoring his brother�s contemptuous requests for a sip. He breathes into the dove�s beak. 
And then the dove is whole again, its small heart no longer still, wings no longer broken. It leaps into the vapors of its home from the deathly ground, pausing only to chime a tune of thanksgiving to its healer and it is gone from this tale. 
Not for the first time, their elder is reminded of how dissimilar they are; as the saying goes, these two wards of his "are as different as night and day." 
�Why did you do THAT?� asks Raven. 
�It seemed the right thing to do. I couldn't let dove stay dead for some reason,� protests Bleach.
It is at this time that their elder decides to make his presence known. He�d followed them this morning as he follows them every morning they are together. Who knows what trouble they can get into? 
He rides his pony closer up behind them, forming a centaur-shaped silhouette on the ground beneath their feet. 
The boys turn to face the music.


He sits slumped forward on the bare back of his elderly pony, supporting his head in his right hand in a thinking gesture. His gray eyes peer at his "grand children" through his dusty spectacles. 

His brow furrows, forming a caterpillar-shape before softening again. He clicks his tongue against what's left of his teeth, signaling to pony that he wished to dismount. 

Instead of lifting a leg over the pony's back, he merely shuffles forward over the pony's head and raises his hand to signal it to stand. He walks to the crow's corpse with the pony in tow, sparing the boys from having to meet his glance a few moments more. 

"Well," he croaks in an old man's voice. 

"It'za crow, Grampah," the younger boy says. 

The old man immediately fixes him with an exasperated stare: I'm not blind, boy. Just because I'm old don't mean I'm stupid! 

First he looks at the twin to his left. The first striking thing upon first glance at him is his eyes. They are small, colorless globes in the middle of his pale, round face. His skin is as pale as ash. His hair is just long enough to stick out over his face and touch his shoulders and is as white as his small teeth.� No wonder the old man calls him "Bleach." 

The boy to the old man's right is the exact opposite of the other; both in appearance and manner.� Both are a terror to discipline, yet this one, he suspects, is pure evil. The lad, in stark contrast to the tattered ensemble preferred by his brother, is impeccably tailored in flashy, new duds. Where did he find it? He cared too much about his clothes, yet he was still a kid.

The outfit was complete with a black cape, chained across the throat with a silver clasp. Only his face and hands can be seen from behind the dark clothing, a gray tint to his skin and long, painted nails. His black hair is full, although contrasting to the gaunt face and haggard skull from which it grows.

The old fellow suspects that one may have missed a few meals, yet the arrogance and conceit apparent in his eyes precludes any pity he may have felt for him. Those very same eyes glint back at his elder with contempt, the portals from which a damned soul perceives the world. He is "Blacky." 

Just as the old fellow clears his throat to begin a lecture, a sudden explosion interrupts him. He wasn't quite caught off-guard, so he turns his back to the spectacle and stares at his dancing shadow. He knew this would happen. 

After all, it happens twice every single year, doesn't it? He isn't surprised that his benighted grandchild shields his eyes beneath the shadowy tent of his cape. He's also isn't surprised that the other one is staring at what he knows he should not be seeing. 

What does surprise him is that the horses are spooked away, but not his faithful pony. The old cuss had died and obediently lay stiffly at his master's feet. 

II


He stares straight at the spectacle, knuckling blood from his eyes as if they were tears.� A  naked woman of angelic beauty can be seen in the sky, her fiery red hair billowing out around her head like a flaming halo. He can't entirely see her body because her most private areas are covered with a sash of pure shadow that surrounds her. 

Bleach can't understand why a woman with such radiance would choose to wear something as hideous as that shawl. It doesn't emphasize her beauty but abolishes it. 

Just then, the monstrous head of a serpent rears up from behind the woman. It meets Bleach's gaze, hypnotizing him with its eyes. The serpent's body is composed entirely of a bleak darkness, but its eyes glow. Not with a light of their own, but with the blinding gleam of the sun reflecting off of a well-polished sword just before the thrust. 

His stiffens with the arctic chill of absolute fear. The serpent makes a move for him, he flinches. Then, all at once, he sees nothing.  

"I can't see, Grampah!" complains the small boy. Actually, the elder man isn't related to the boys by name, blood, or species. They're halvan-nymphs, the sons of a great warrior and the Goddess of Harvest. The old man is of the accursed's spawn.   

"Well, heal yourself with the spell I had just taught you, stupid boy! Does it take pain to cause you to forget your lessons?!!?" calls Gramp's voice from beyond the curtain of darkness. It doesn't echo as if from within a tunnel or from above as if you just happened to fall in a hole, but is clear and precise. 
 
The boy does as he is asked, and the world slowly comes into focus as if it were being painted meticulously upon a canvas. 

The Suns of Galfaste, once more flying their figure-eight formation around their queen, begin to set in the west. Darn! He missed it again! He finally got a chance to see the fabled Equinox and lost his sight just as it was getting good. 

When his gaze returns to his grandfather who is   leaning on his cane before him, he mutters an apology. 

Grampah sighs and begins his lecture: "You must never be so foolish. God's Flower is the mother of us all. We are her children. If not for her gifts of light, all life in this world would cease to exist. So, upon the hour of her desecration, you must avert your eyes as a show of respect. Never awe at her naked glow, for not even you is worthy of such a vision." 

In an instant, it is has become nighttime. Bleach collapses, falling asleep even as he hits the floor. 

The coniferous blossom, which he had intended to plant with the help of his brother, fell loose from his pack and lay on the grass beside him. 

His brother would have crushed this as well if Grampah had not caught his foot with the cane and tripped him. "Blacky...� 

The boy stands and shouts, �Call me Raven's Feather!�

�Whatever you are called, that was a vile thing you did! Is your heart so cold and hard as stone that you know no compassion? All creatures were born to die, but it is not your task to decide their fates!!!"  

Raven's Featehr screws his mouth in a shrewd smile, "Deride yourself, 'thou strok'dst me, and mad'st much of me; would'st give me water with berries in 't; and teach me how to name the bigger light and how the less, that burn by day and night; and then I lov'd thee in mine own, and shew'd thee all the qualities of the isle.'" 

Grampah is nonplussed by this and then recalls the same play; "'Abhorred slave; which any print of human goodness will not take, capable of all ill... I have used thee, filth as thou art, with human care; and lodged thee in mine own, till thou didst seek to violate the honor of my child.'" At this, Bleach cries fitfully in his sleep.  

Raven's Featehr, demurred rebukes him with, "You presume too much." 

Grampah carries his "grand child" off to the camp, a scornful eye on Raven's Featehr.� "I am by name... you are by nature.� Evil Spawn they call me, Evil Spawn you truly be.


III
�
Bleach awakens and yawns widely. Grampah, sitting in his usual chair in front of the fire, stokes the flames. He glances over his shoulder at his grandchild, steadying his horn rims with his thumb. "Well, well! What a mighty sound from such a small boy! Make your bed and wash; you can have breakfast when you're clean!" Bleach looks out the window that overlooks his bed, basking in the light of dawn. All of his life, he has slept since sunset to sunrise, and he still finds pride in the warm glow. It's as if, in her wisdom, God's Flower refuses to grace the sky with her presence, unless her favorite (himself) is awake. It's a beautiful, but childish fantasy, and he knows it, but still... There's always faith. By contrast, Grampah never seems to sleep.
�
Bleach quickly, but reverently, tucks the sheets of the small bed under its meager mattress and fluffs the pillow. Although faded from many years of use the topmost blanket or pillow case shines with a wealth of color: a beautiful rainbow-arch originating somewhere in the "horizon" of the design and ending at a pot of gold; the thousands of hand-woven coins each bearing his youthful face. This was a gift from his mother, which she had crafted on her rare visits. 

Bleach frowned. He had to check the chart on the wall. His height is marked there each birthday. The chart�s last measurement shows his height at his tenth such day which happened three weeks ago. In the middle, a month after his fifth birthday, there is a small, crying face to indicate his mother�s death that he drawn. As was custom, the reaps of each year's harvest was also considered. The numbers for harvest started diminishing around her death. And a new Harvest Goddess hasn�t been appointed since then. 8 years ago. She�d been dead half of his life. Sometimes, he greatly dreaded growing older and increasing that sad gap of loss.  
�
Well, he can�t dwell on the past much longer. At least, dwelling while standing in one place won�t do any good, but he could dwell while he washed. ���� 

Bleach rushes out of the cottage, wearing only a towel tied around his meager waist and runs bare-foot down the paved streets of the city and quickly arrives at the communal bathhouse, which is in the center of the Town Square. Once inside, he rips off the towel without the least of cares and dives straight into the cold water, making sure that he is a considerate distance away from the elders. Underwater, he curls himself into a ball, and "turtles" to the surface, holding his breath as long as he can. When he can no longer hold it, he springs his body upward.
�
The dull crack of his skull on bone echoes throughout the enclosure. Bleach whirls around, almost tripping Amy with his flailing feet. She stands before him, two years his senior and a few inches shorter than his brother; her nose bleeding profusely down her chin and into the water. Bleach's panicked mind becomes unhinged, leaving him dumbfounded and speechless. 
�
The pangs of long-suppressed amour towards her suddenly well up from his heart and he would of spouted poetry in declaration of his love for her, yet the words become caught in his throat and he chokes them down with all of his effort. For the moment, his usually pale face was suddenly flushed with color. S-s-s-sorry, Amy," he finally blathers, cursing his idiot tongue at his time of need.
�
"It's okay, Small Fry. I should have known better." She holds one of her long-fingered hands to her nose to stop the bleeding and tilts her head back. As she does this, her ample chest thrusts forward in an unintentional and ambitious seduction. Bleach shies away from this in shame, peering down at himself. For the first time in all of his life, he realizes his own nakedness within this small town. At first, the good-natured and carefree spirit of these people had elated him as a youngster. But now, he has grown to distrust it.
�
The original settlers of Lover�s Climb were a man and a woman, deeply in love, who had fled the strife of their homes so they could live together. They were both born and raised within the frozen regions of the northern mountain range; their house separated by an age-old and barely remembered conflict.
�
They had met by accident in the wilderness that bordered their homes. He and his uncle were hunting when they came across the woman, bathing in a clear stream. He had caught sight of her and cried aloud in appreciation of her beauty. As she was wading out of the water to dress, the uncle took hold of her. The man had never liked his uncle, who had been his foster parent and abused him as a youth, and it grieved his heart to see this beautiful woman being handled so roughly. He struck his uncle from behind and threw him into the water. As he turned to tell her to flee, his uncle leapt upon his back and bore him to the ground. His uncle cursed at him and brandished a knife in his face. While wrestling for possession of the knife, the two men rolled down a steep hill and eventually struck a tree. The force of the impact had hurled them apart.� After his attempts to reason with the man failed, he relinquished his life to the hands of his elder; on condition that the woman is allowed to leave. The foolish old man had slipped on the ice and fallen on his own blade, piercing his vile heart with its rugged steel.
�
They then fled from the scene of the bloodshed before either of their families could learn of the events which lead to their meeting. They eventually reached the peak of the highest mountain and were surprised of the warmth of the climate after having lived so long in the cold. According to folk lore, the lovers had stripped off their sodden clothes and heavy jackets, their skin slick with perspiration, and made love on the very spot where this bath house now stands. 
�
Every person in this entire city is reputed to being a direct descendant of the lovers, the children of Lover�s Climb. The most beautiful and well-endowed people of the entire world, bred to perfection for centuries. It has become tradition that all lovers in the city should make love for the first time in public, within the walls of the bathhouse to purify their souls.

��������������� 
"Now, peering down upon himself... Bleach finally recognizes the true differences which set him apart from her.
��� 
�He has known and recognized the difference of some children being "boys" (which he is) and "girls" (which she is) for several years (although he never understood WHY there is difference), and has grown to accept it as he would the fact that his beating heart keeps him alive.� But, now, in his despair, what he sees further alienates him from her.
�
She loved him. She knew it was foolish, since he didn't truly love her. She had loved both of them for so long. They were different. Completely unlike any two people she'd ever met. And this was why she loved them.
�
She herself is far too ordinary. Others may have commented on how her beauty, but they would call just about anything beautiful. To her, it was a hollow word. As a girl, she had once cavorted in a mound of fertilizer because she had believed that it would magically expedite her growth much like that of plants; for which a farmer relative of hers had named it "miraculous". It wasn't until afterward that she had realized that the word "fertilizer" was actually synonymous with "horse shit." From this day, Amy never trusted anything anyone ever said. If a pile of animal feces could be a called a "miracle," then the word "beautiful" can also be a euphemism for ugliness. She had the misfortune of living in a city of lies. She had been born here and could see no means of her own to leave. Yet, they had been born elsewhere, in the outside world! Together they may conceive of a way to escape.
�
She had failed in her attempt to "persuade" his brother to take her. Take her from here. She had approached him once, just after midnight. She knew what others would only guess: he prowls at night. She could never remember seeing him during the day. She couldn�t quite say that if she had seen him, that she would have been capable of recognizing him because she never had the chance to see much of his face. Yet, because of the fact that he was even out at all during the night was indication enough of who he was. She was also sure, were it someone else, then they would not have left their home without the aid of lantern. 
�
She had snuck out of her house wearing only a flimsy nightgown and had carried no light. Even though it was cold out, the nightgown was drenched in a sweat of anticipation so that it clung to her uncomfortably. 

She decided to take it off and as she pulled it over her head, she smelled him even before she had heard the ghostly flap of that cape he wore. At first, she had been afraid of that sound. 

It reminded her of window that had been left open at night; a window through which the wind might blow and rustle a curtain. A window through which something else far more sinister might crawl through...

Yet, she had not run because her first sign of his passage had not been that sound, yet it had been his smell. It was the fact that he actually smelled, really. 

She was sure that he bathed; yet the smell which had wafted through her nostrils and electrified her brain with excitement had not been a smell which a body could naturally produce. What she had smelled was most assuredly blood. 

She finally extricated herself from the sodden garment and had carelessly rolled it up into a ball and threw it behind her into the bushes where it would stay forever for all she cared. 

When she was rid of it, her last shreds of modestly and the fear which it produced was gone. She at first held her arms across her breasts for a moment, and then let them fall seductively to her sides with her hands on her hips. She was ready.
�
As he passed the tree behind which she hid, she could see that he was definitely drenched in the stuff. It was also obvious that it wasn�t his own blood, because she saw that he was carrying the corpse of a deer slung almost casually over one shoulder. He must have been hunting. Surely, this thought would have driven her mad with fear. She knew that it should of definitely. Instead, it aroused goose bumps on her soft, slick skin. All at once, she was no longer afraid. 
�
He sensed this change in her, because he stopped in mid-stride and had looked over his other shoulder and had looked right at her. She stood up straight and had stepped out onto the path to meet him. 

She had calmly walked right up to him, sweating, but no longer afraid. The look in his eyes was not one of surprise or annoyance. He had just expected her to be there. Perhaps, he had known where she was all along and only waited until she had gotten the nerve to approach him. He didn�t turn, so she walked around him in a short semi-circle so that she faced him. Even drenched with the blood of a deer, carrying the remains of it over one shoulder, she approached. She walked right up to him and had even hugged him, her arms circled around his waist, and he hadn�t even blinked at her. 

She walked right up to him and had even hugged him, her arms circled around his waist, and he hadn�t even blinked at her. She drove her lower half into his, smothering him, and still no reaction. His expression had not changed. She didn�t even feel him react, where she caressed him. He didn�t stiffen� down there. This was impossible! 

She had come to him, in the middle of the night, not wearing anything. And not one damned reaction. Not even so much as a twitch. That wasn�t a true. No sooner than she thought this, he did react. He dropped the carcass and shrugged elaborately,his arms fully extended to demonstrate his annoyance with her. 

Before he could speak, she kissed him & probed his mouth with her tongue, its pink flesh massaging his teeth, licking and tasting the gore. She attacked his tongue with her own, tantalizing it and pestering. She sensed his barriers soften even as she felt him harden, she leapt up, scissoring her legs around his hips.

Then he finally did embrace her, but not in a way she wanted him to because he enfolded his arms around her too tightly & suddenly he crushes her torso into his with the force of a vice. When she gapes in surprise, he bites down savagely on the tender flesh of her tongue, drawing blood.

He had held her for almost a minute, crushing her, and had dropped her. He picked up the corpse that he�d dropped and left without ever uttering a single word. He had not actually bitten her hard, so she was able to eat and talk without pain in only a couple of days. But still, he did drink her blood.
�
Now, this one has also drawn her blood, although inadvertently. Perhaps she had been too eager. She was so clumsy with men! She laughed. Even through the steeple of her fingers and the abating flow of her own blood, she catches him peaking shyly at her breasts. Afterwards, he hangs his head, staring thoughtfully at his genitals. She guesses that he might have felt something stir down there and is uniquely pleased with herself.
�
"Well," she says, lowering her head to face him when the bleeding has stopped. It would seem she had not been as seriously hurt as he'd originally thought. Even though a few seconds have passed since this incident had begun, it seems like an eternity to poor little Bleach. "That's okay; I'm not going to scold you. It was my fault," she comforts him, mistaking his self-examination for downcast shame; further sparing him any more embarrassment. "I just... I just wanted to know if you could teach me that... What you just did before."

Bleach is instantly buoyed from his former gloom, fueled with delight. She doesn't know how to swim! She's two years older than I am, and she can't swim! I can teach her! Yay! "To turtle?" the words explode forth from him like a geyser of pure joy, spouting forth from beneath his usually gloomy surface. "Sure!" His enthusiasm is infectious. 
�
He scampers up the wall of the bath with the speed and sure-footedness of a little monkey. He squats, hugging his legs tight to his chest with both frail arms. "First, you jump in. Then, you do this," he demonstrates by squatting and tightly embracing his knees. "If you jump in all tucked in like this, it's called a cannon ball!�

"Any way, you can hold your nose if you want, but be sure to take a deep breath and hold it before you jump in, okay?� When you just can't hold your breath any longer and need more air, do this," he springs onto his feet, head thrust back and upward. He slips on the wet floor, performing an incredibly painful belly flop. 
�
After catching his breath, Bleach gasps, "Knocked the wind out of me that's all." Amy giggles, holding him up with his arm over her shoulders and hugging him tight with her own. He looks at her incredulously, which causes her to laugh even harder. "What?" 

"I was just thinking, it probably didn't knock too much out you, because you've got a whole lot more where that came from left in you!" He stares at her and suddenly guffaws with breathless laughter, sounding like an elderly donkey with asthma. The two children laugh and play, splashing and wrestling, diving and submerging, kicking and running around the pool in a game of tag---knowing first-hand how dangerous it is, but, nether the less, too involved in having fun to care.
�
Later, they towel off and dress in the small coed changing area in the rear of the building and set out on a romp through town. Walking and running, giggling and laughing, and having fun. Bleach always liked her; she's Blacky's girlfriend. He knows, because they once kissed (her and Blacky, not him and her). Right in the middle of the night, during a lunar eclipse!
�
That night, Bleach had trouble going to sleep, so he just watched the world blacken and rot into Night. There were thousands of noises in the darkness: hooting owls and chirping crickets squeaking rats and all other manifestations of the night. The vile eyes of the Serpents scoured the blackness in their loathsome search to desecrate the Heavenly, causing Bleach to cringe each time they flew over his house. Yet in spite, of this, he had managed to witness them kiss. He was too young to understand romance, yet even a boy knows what a couple must feel for each other to kiss. 
              
IV

Jaste while wearing a black bandanna on his left elbow, thrusts out his scrawny chest like a frog courting for its mate. The simile is perhaps quite apt because of the blush on Amy�s face that the gesture elicits. Beneath the red tiara in her hair, her face is quite pink. Bleach, as pale as ever, is rather green with jealousy for this fact. Victor while also wearing a black bandanna, chuckles; causing the rolls of fat in his belly to jiggle. Amy�s blush deepens. 

Bleach impatiently glances between the two other boys who are standing on opposite sides of the pool, from Jaste to Victor to Jaste again, much like a spectator watching a tennis match. He grumbles something about the water getting colder. 

�That�s really funny. You look as if you�re frostbitten, but the lady over there must be boiling like a lobster,� commented Jaste. Victor jiggles some more. 

�Are we going to be waiting any longer? If I have to see Lardy�s stomach doing its jelly imitation any longer, I think I�m going to have to throw up!� shouted Galf from the pool. Victor finally stopped laughing long enough to make an obscene gesture at Galf.  

�Now that�s enough!� shouted Amy. �Now either we continue the game or we all get of the pool, now.� She said this even while giggling as Galf disgustedly washed his face off. �Now have we learned to call each other by our proper names?� Galf muttered an apology to Victor.

�Is it my turn to pee on the pale boy?� joked Jaste. Before Amy could admonish him, he had already leapt forward into the pool, shouting �Engarde!� at the top of his lungs. 

Victor makes his leap simultaneously. Victor at first stays in one place and dodges back and forth, waiting for an opening, and is subsequently cornered by Galfad and Vath. Jaste, on the other hand, dives beneath the surface of the water and bodily torpedoes himself off of the wall by kicking at it with his feet. He shoots between Bleach and the others, heading straight for Amy. No longer able to hold his breath any longer, he surfaces within a few feet of Amy. Just as he reaches for her, the other two boys each grab a foot and drag him back under. Guardians win!

Today, they're playing Guardians and Serpents. The rules are simple enough: six boys and one girl represent the eternal struggle of good versus evil. The idea is that the two players wearing the black bandannas on their arms (the Serpents) attack the four boys without the bandannas (the Guardians) in an attempt to capture their Queen. The rules explicitly state that a girl must only play this part. And, since Amy is the only girl who ever volunteered to play with them, she always played the Queen. Obviously, the �Guardians� win more often than not. 
�
But, if a Serpent does manage to reach Amy without being detained, then whoever last touched --- or came closest to touching them --- must trade places and become a Serpent until they can earn their way back. 

Jaste takes a moment to cough out the water he'd swallowed then scrambles back up the wall to begin another round. He counts to ten by odd numbers, Vic by evens, so that each boy gets to take part: "One," "Two," etc. Instead of leaping straight in after Vic says "TEN," Jaste swings his arms back and forth and winks. Vic winks back, message received. "Engarde!"
�
Victor leaps practically straight up, tucking his body into a ball, and crashes into the water backside first. Because of his considerable body mass, the water is not only displaced, but actually explodes upward and out, as if being pounded by a gigantic hammer. The resulting turmoil drenches and blinds the two Guardians who have unwittingly swum into the fray.
�
Jaste, however, flips head-over heels into the water, landing at an angle in the water, which is a useful enough deterrent to keep Bleach and Chris at bay in order to avoid being knocked senseless by his flailing limbs. This, accompanied with the fallout from Vic's blatant crash landing, puts a hole in the Guardian's cohesiveness. As soon as he gets his feet firmly on the ground, Jaste begins to pummel both Bleach and Chris with wave after wave after countless waves, using his height to full advantage so he could effectively avoid any damage from their futile counter attacks. 
�
Bleach, blinded by water and desperate to end the onslaught, raises his right hand up and traces a spiral in the air with his index finger. The water forms a great whirlpool, which spins and spins even as his hand moves, following his magical command. Still tracing the spiral, Bleach jabs his hand skyward, commanding the water to go up, up, up, up.
�
The other boys stare in awe as all of the water first coagulates into a liquid vortex and then rises skyward. There isn't anyone else around this afternoon, so there wasn�t much of stir besides the small group of children�s shocked silence. Truth be told, Bleach is the most surprised. Vash's hair is standing up on end not from fright but from the suction. He slaps Bleach on the back appreciatively. This causes Bleach to lose his concentration. Instead of falling in a methodical and gradual shower, the water crashes down onto them --- as if a thirsty giant, pausing to drink, had thought better of it and thrown the water back down in disgust. 
�
Incredibly, ludicrously, devilishly, despite what has just transpired, Jaste still has the gall to continue the game. He elbows Bleach aside with quick jab to his side, and gooses Amy's flabby left flank with a rough slap. They kiss, and Bleach, after catching a second wind, relinquishes his post.

V

After the game, Bleach slinks home with the black bandanna tied very tightly to his left elbow. Jaste had insisted on tying the knot and he had done his best to tighten until Bleach sobbed (the �better to teach him a lesson� as he put it). Still crying embarrassed tears, he has no idea how grandfather will take this news. Rather than a simple game, it is a cornerstone of the community and adults take it very seriously. 

The door to their cottage creaks forbiddingly under Bleach�s grasp. He peeks his head into the dark chamber, checking to see the old fellow is taking a nap or awake. He�d prefer to take a nap himself to sleep this day away. But he isn�t so lucky this time. 

Grampah is sitting in his usual chair in front of the fire, no longer stoking the flames. He glances over his shoulder at his grandchild, steadying his horn rims with his thumb. "Stupid boy!" he scolds. He turns from the fires, brandishing the stick he uses on the fire. "Have I not told you not to squander your gift for idle amusement of your few friends? Idiot boy!" These words, more than the threat of pain from a lashing, strike more fear into Bleach's young heart than anything else could ever provide. 
��� 
However, rather than making good his threat with the stick, Grampah kicks Bleach so hard and so unexpectedly on the buttocks, that he is flipped head-over-heels and lands facing up on the bed. His eyes wide from shock, he stares at his "grandfather"---who, from this vantage point, appears to be standing on the ceiling and hovering over the "floor" --- struck dumb with a comical look of surprise.
�
Grampah laughs, breaking the stick in two on his knee, and throws it into the fire. "That was for over-stepping your boundaries. If there's a beating to be given, I decide when. Not you. I recall, the night of the Equinox, I had just reprimanded you for not using your skills in a time of need. Although you did, accidentally, squander the gift, I think it was only a natural reflex action. In fact, I believe that it was instinct and you were as surprised by anyone by what had happened.� Bleach would have agreed, yet didn�t speak. 
�
"In fact, I think those tactics that the other boys used were against the rules of the game. So, I think it is justified that Jaste should never be allowed to play again... until he has proven he can play fairly. You should win back your position by default. Right?" He puts his hands to his hips, glares "up" at Bleach, and winks. Bleach leaps to his feet, hurriedly makes his bed, hugs Grampah, and runs full-tilt to the bathhouse, forgetting his towel. He washes hurriedly, since the other children are nowhere in sight, and must rush back to the cottage, naked and wet, to dry off.
�
Grampah stands at the doorway, Bleach's towel draped over his shoulders and his own around his waist. "Now, I guess you've forgot this, have you? I see you are wet. You're not allowed in the house wet, so you'll just have to wait until I'm finished to get it back. By that time, you might be dry enough that you might not need it. But, don't forget next time." The ancient creature hobbles feebly, taking his steps with exaggerated care, acting more like an old man than he is predisposed to. Shivering in the unusually cool air, Bleach follows close at his heels.
�
Finally, two hours later, they reach their goal. A similar walk which would have taken Bleach a quarter of the time and Grampah just over half. 

By this time, the young boy is so fueled by his impatience that he's literally on the verge of explosion. Blast that old man for his belittling ways, he thinks blasphemously. 

To further antagonize him, instead of just climbing into the large public bath, the old man hobbles to the private room in the back, where the dwarven gypsies usually bathed. 

This was built to accommodate the emigrants who periodically would wander through town, few if any willing to stay. All of which were widows who shrouded themselves in dark garments and wore veils over their faces. 

One couldn't glimpse hand nor foot or anything in between of them since they usually kept the door tightly shut while they were here. The gypsies were required not to ensconce themselves for too long and also kept their children within the community.���� 
�
At the threshold of the inner door, Bleach, no longer able to control himself, rips the towel from Gramp's waist and reveals the old man fully and completely. His eyes bulge out in immeasurable shock, surprise, and amazement. The naked body isn't a thing which he has ever been ignorant of, but this completely stupefies him.
�
Grampah catches hold of Bleach's arm with his left hand, closing the inner door with his right so hard that it sounds like a thunder-crack: BANG! Safe from the eyes of others---of which there were a few and none, thankfully, had seen the Secret except for the boy---, Grampah begins to slap the boy out his daze.
�
"You little brat! So, you've seen me for the first time, have you?" he shouts. "Now, isn't it clear why I chose to bathe in the confines of these four walls? Not modesty. Nobody's modest here, except for the gypsies. I suppose you've heard my name, have you?" The boy is too choked up from tears to speak. "Davik! Son of Dav: Son of a Demon! My father was of the Dav-Torve. My father was the bastard son of an ork, of all creatures! I am the sole survivor of Faghrod." This causes the boy to back-peddle until he reaches the far wall, pounding his own head soundlessly (but not less painfully) against the wall with uncharacteristic force. 
�
Bleach whimpers. The old man now turns aside from the sight of the child, and sees that he had not fully closed the door. It was ajar by approximately half an inch. This causes him to relent. He checks for any sign of observers, seeing none, he closes the door gently and sighs at the clicking sound of the lock. 

"I didn't mean to frighten you, boy. It's just that... this city was created on the basis of love. Considering the legacy I have been born in, love is not an option. It's my curse. I... saw you with that young girl, two years your senior, showing her affections to you most of all. But, you pretend to not notice. This entices her more. Sorry." For the first time in his life, despite his incredible age, this is the first time that he actually speaks as an elderly creature.
�
Bleach apprehensively steps to the naked old man's side, supporting him with his shoulder. Gramp's peers at him, a tear his eye, and smiles. "Grandfather," whispers Bleach, "I know how losing my mother has burdened you, which it has to both of us. She, after all, was my mother. And you were her protector, but tell me of Faghrod. I have heard there were no survivors. And those who had, well, survived, were all imprisoned.� As you've said countless times. But tell me once more. Please."
�
"In deed... Faghrod," Grampah says, thankful for the boy's considerate curiosity. "It was a city, as majestic as this, but more pure. In the city of Faghrod, all of the benevolent races of the world lived in harmony. There was no hatred, only for those who devoted their lives to Dark Forces... the Orks, Vampires, Werewolves, Darklings, and the Dark Lords of myth.
�
"There, the dwarves, elves, and humans lived in a great city, founded by the dwarf, Galahad. The orks invaded once and desecrated Galahad's queen. The second time, after Dav's death and when I was a young man, they decimated all. I had hid in a well. And, thanks to my cowardice, survived. What I never told you is why my dwarven rescuers let me live. I had offered them my life and they spared me. With a flaming brand, they... so I could never have children. You see, the reason I raised you... and your brother... was because I could never have any of my own."
�
Old man and young boy, grandfather and grandson, stand, in each other's arms, the rest of the world forgotten. The only thing that matters to each one is the other's proximity, closeness, and love. In time, Grampah descends into the cool waters of his bath, and Bleach trails off, still without a towel, but dry.
�
VI

At the main entrance, stands Jaste, his arms crossed and dressed in a tunic and a pair of baggy trousers. He chuckles.
�
"What?" demands Bleach indignantly.

"It's Lunch Time and you're still taking a bath! C'mon, Small Fry, I'll race ya home so you can get dressed. AND you can be Guardian next time!" 
�
Bleach immediately cheers up and dashes right through the doors, leaving Jaste in his dust.
�
"Hey! Wait up!!!"
�
VII

Amy had watched as the small boy and the ancient gnome came into the main hall.� She can tell that neither of them had noticed her yet, so she easily slips away into the shadows. 

Ivor, as she knows him secretly in her heart, is naked and a little damp.� She has seen him nude on several previous occasions, (in fact, she's seen him this way more often than when he was wearing clothes) but the sight of him never fails to excite her.�

It's more than obvious that he is more than a little upset with his "grandfather." She had heard that it was in the nature of that species to be cruel, but this particular Dav-Torve always blended a lesson into his punishments.
�
She was dismayed that they were heading right towards her and she froze in panic. She looked to either side and saw no means of escape. 

Finally, she dove to her right, behind a potted plant. Yet, she wasn't fast enough. He tripped over her ankle and muttered a curse without seeming to notice who she was. He must have been more upset than she had thought. From where she lay, she caught quite an eye-full of him and smiled despite herself. She watched his buttocks flex as he stamped into the private room of the bathhouse and turn about to glare at his foster parent. She giggled at the clear view of his penis and the scowling expression on his face which this rare stroke of luck had afforded her. She knew he worshiped her and resolved herself to remember him this way and never tell him that she had seen him. 
�
The agling took much longer to manage those few steps. It was obvious that he was relishing this as much as Amy was. All at once, Ivor makes a grab at the towel around the waist of his elder and whips it off like a magician would do with a tablecloth in a trick. Amy puts both hands to her mouth and gasps at what she sees. The grandfather grabs at the boy's wrist and slams the door, hard. Amy flinches yet finds herself creeping forward despite her fear. She is concerned, but her curiosity is overwhelming. The door had been shut, but fortunately had not been locked. She turns the lock slowly and pushes it open just a crack. She hears, "... seen me for the first time," then a whack which turns her stomach. 
�
When Ivor begins to cry, she steps back and doesn't know if she intends to storm in or run away, but she hears the agling apologize. He closes the door completely, once again forgetting to lock it. Amy leans against the door and peeks at them through the keyhole. She cannot fully hear what they are saying, but can catch most of the words and is relieved when she sees them hug each other. It's so beautiful that she begins to cry. When the boy disengages and begins to walk toward the door she springs to her feet and takes running swan dive into the pool without even looking to see where she's going. When she surfaces, she sees him walk right past her without so much as a glance in his direction and sees him begin to talk with Jaste, that amoral little boy who goosed her yesterday. They leave together, Ivor leading the way. Amy decides to stay where she is. It has been exciting enough already, she decides. Besides, her mother is seated in the opposite end of the pool, in the middle of a knot of her gossipy neighbors. She waves Amy over to speak with the others. Yes, she is acting very embarrassingly un-lady-like today, mother.

Darkling  Romance; part two of the  dove  & crow Saga


Chapter Two:
Saying �Goodbye� is Always Difficult
(Amy�s Exit).
�
I


But first, An Interlude with the Vampire:
His malignant heart was rife with a hatred of all things. Everything within his sight, he hated. Every sound in the night, every nuance of life and un-life, the incessantly chirping crickets, the silence of stones, were all things which his ambiguous hatred consumed of him. He had once seen his own face, in the glimmering steel of a knife he had intended to steal from a butcher, and hated himself at first sight. He had not known what it was that he had perceived in that brief second before he had struck at it in rage, before he had cut himself so grievously that he bled.� He had drank of his blood that first time, instinctively suckling from it as a newborn child would of another source --- only, his initial motive had not been merely an act of gaining nourishment, but a reflexive action. Afterwards, he hated the butcher for possessing such an object to bring harm to him. He hated pain even more than all things, even more than he'd hated himself a moment ago.� He'd taken the knife, carried it with him into the home of the butcher which had brought him such pain, and had given it back to him in a way much more intimate than the butcher would have ever wanted. He had given it back to him --- right through the bastard's heart.
�
There had been a time when his life had not been so simple, when he had agonized for many hours, many days, every waking moment. And every one in which he wasn't awake at all; his misfortune had plagued him in his dreams, as well. He had so desired not to be in such chaos, had wanted to settle for one and only emotion. Something he could count on. 
�A friend which would never leave him, no matter where he went. A friend he could never leave behind, even if he thought that he no longer need it, because deep in his heart, he would always need it. He so desperately wanted a friend. A guiding light: a dream.
�But, above all things (or, much rather, "beneath" them, in his esteem) was his own mother. He hated her for giving birth to him; a gift, which he often thought, was not given profitably. That was too kind. She had freed him from a claustrophobically small prison which had been all the more uncomfortable since he had been forced to share it with his brother, only to be put him in a much larger one. 
�Even as he reflects on these things, the twin moons of Dava sweep the night sky; their serpentine eyes gaze upon the world in a ceaseless search for light. They are the embodiment of shadow, creatures so hideous that they blend in perfectly with the night. They furnish no light of their own, but are ruthless thieves of it. They exist only to taint the beauty of God's Flower. To corrupt and covet her warmth and luster selfishly, rather than shine upon the world in tribute to her. His foolish brother happily walks in the light of day.� Raven's Featehr prefers the night.
�He and his brother were born to the Goddess of Harvest during an equinox. They had both been reminded of this fact throughout their young lives, yet Raven Feather (for such is the name which he'd given himself) could remember that day as vividly as any other moment of his life. They hadn't been born separately, as all other, ordinary twins were. No, they came into the world at the exact same instant, in each other's arms.� The first sight of his life had been that idiot�s face. That face, so like his own. It had seemed that he had been looking into a mirror at his own reflection. So infuriated was he that his infants hands had found themselves firmly clamp around his idiotic brother's throat, so accustomed had he been to murder, even on the hour of his birth. It was then that his brother had awakened, his eyes betraying surprise, then mortal terror. He brought his own face within an inch from the others and cursed him while he could only gag breathlessly.� He watched as the life drained out of the eyes of that pale face. His brother only cried and loosely embraced him, wanting him to stop, yet unwilling to let go all the same.� The act would have been so deliciously fulfilled if their mother had not separated them at that moment. She then held each child to either breast so that they would not need to share. The idiot drank of her hungrily, yet Raven would have none of her. He would not drink her milk; he only wished he were dead; anything would have been better than accepting nourishment from her. When she pressed him to try a taste of it, he had bitten at her with his teeth, making her bleed. It was only after this first taste of blood that he had deemed to suckle from her.
�While her children fed from her, she raised her face to the heavens and sang in praise of the Sky Woman, praying for her to watch over her children. They both looked up at the same instant, witnessing the same event for the first time in their lives. It was a sight that would never fail to enrapture his stupid brother, even a decade later. As they all stared at the sky, their mother named them. She called him Ebon, his brother Ivor. �It is through their union that Dusk and Dawn might finally see each other, eye to eye.� He could sense the love she and his mother felt for each other at this moment, their love for him. He could only hate them both in return. She thwarted him in his search for vengeance, so he could only take solace in the knowledge that, thanks to his efforts, his brother would forever have the complexion of a walking corpse.�� 
�Ever since then, each has pledged their hearts to opposite forces. Even as the darkness usurped the blasted light's rule, Raven's Featehr embraced it. Embraced it in the way his mother had pretended to embrace him. Even as the serpents crushed the life out of the Sky Woman, his own mother attempted to crush him! Did she somehow sense, even at birth, the evil that lurked in his heart? She crooned, kissed, and laughed, mocking his hatred of her with her false love. Consequently, it is only during the biannual equinox (the First and Last day of the Dwarven Calendar) that they can walk the earth together.
�While he broods in his dark thoughts, the twin moons of Dava traverse the darkness. Other people can only see the eyes of the Serpents, but he can see more. The Serpents glide and sliver along the sky, crisscrossing and running parallel of each other, enthralled in their search for the light. He respects their determination, but questions their goal. Why seek the blinding light of day, when they could simply rescind it and hunt in the night like him? 
�Hunt. This leads him to another memory. He smiles. Watching as a cloud passes in front of the moons, Raven's Featehr recalls Amy. Beautiful, lively, succulent Amy: the virgin princess. He despises her beauty, her maturity, and her being female. Bawdy, precocious Amy. She is a lewd mockery of the Sky Woman; chasing after the males, always ready to surrender herself to any man, never succeeding. She would willingly be ravaged by any man stupid enough to have her. And corrupting their flesh with hers, spawning bastard children like a blighted plot of farm land. 
�She had approached him once, just after a hunt. she had ruined a perfectly good meal with her intrusion. Yet, she had unwillingly quenched his thirst. He suspected that she would have given herself to a eunuch, if only because he once HAD been a man.
�She had done her best even to seduce, even going so far to kiss him. Even if he wasn't able to see in the dark, there was no way he could miss the way her nipples lanced at his muscular chest. He had surprised her by clamping his teeth into the tender flesh of her tongue, drinking heavily of its sweet, spittle- ridden blood. He had meant it as a warning to dissuade her from further intrusions, yet he had drunken from her. He also wanted some more.
�

�
The Would-be Heroine:
"Today is special." That's what she had said. She hadn't bothered to explain, but one could hardly miss her meaning. To her, it was a special day. Amy doubted it. She had always had arguments with her mother. And, more often than not, they were never resolved. They would continue shouting at each other until they could only agree on not wishing to see each other's face again, then they would go off into opposite rooms and close their doors. Amy would always slam her door as hard as she could, practically rattling it off of its hinges. One time, it had actually fallen off: thereby causing yet another argument. As for her darling mother, she never slams her door. The woman is as quiet as a titmouse. One could hardly believe that the minuscule-little heart of her hasn�t simply stopped by now. Surely, such a puritanical soul would not be much longer for this world. And now, she was piping about how simply SPECIAL today was. Imagine that! 
�
Of course they both knew what was so special about today, yet you didn't see Amy getting excited about it, did you? Nope. In fact, she was afraid that this day would ever happen. It wasn't always this way. She had always dreamed of this day since her seventh birthday, the day she had truly met her beloved. In truth she had held him often enough when he'd been a baby. She had loved him, in a way, since he was favored child of their �Goddess of Harvest� and it had been her responsibility to care for him while him while his mother was away. She had been a woman whom Amy admired. That made him not much more than a surrogate younger brother. Yet, when his mother had passed on, she had fallen in love with him because he had been the one to comfort her with her grief; rather than her comforting him with his own. She envied his bravery. Even at that ridiculously young age, she had known they were destined for each other. But theirs was a love that was never meant to be: simply because of the two-year gap in their ages. She also suspected that he might not be allowed to procreate, because he was so different. 
�
And now, the day that she feared most of all has finally come. It was at this year�s ceremony that Amy and her peers would sacrifice their virginity to the general public in attendance. The belief was that the more prolific their young women were in reproduction, and then the yield at the annual harvest would consequently become improved. But Amy knew what the real festivities were. It was nothing more than one of the many �Degradations� which lowlier people rumored to take part in: an orgy. Amy also was offended by the fact that boys weren�t similarly required to �prove� themselves. But, what could she do? All of her eldest friends had already performed at the ceremony in years before, and today was finally her turn. She had no choice but to attend. Even though her mother openly rejoiced this "pivotal point" in her daughter's life, Amy could only dread it. The night before, there had been none of the usual bickering. Amy had quietly locked herself in her room and wept into her pillow. She remembered the events of the day and this made her cry even harder. No one had come to console her. She had merely cried herself into exhaustion and had a fitful sleep.
�
She had reached a decision before the morning and had decided to make a concentrated effort to not allow herself to remember anything at all that would happen to her today.

She had eaten a breakfast she couldn't remember and put on the ceremonial skirt and sash and had walked blindly into a short line of other, similarly- dressed girls. (This was closest thing to a uniform necessitated by law. Since there was no official dress code for this or any occasion, most girls would wear their elder sisters� outfits. The most common color was green. Amy herself hadn�t even noticed in what color she had adorned herself. It hardly mattered; anyhow, since the sooner she took it off, the sooner she and everyone else would be happy.)� She saw amongst their faces a variety of expressions, from joy, to bewilderment, and even fear. Most of the girls had held their arms shyly across their breasts. She had not. She was determined to get this over as quickly as possible and didn't care who was looking at her. 

Then she did something... something she had chosen to forget. During which, her mother actually fainted while watching but Amy hardly cared. 

Her attention had already had been diverted the person whom she most wanted to see. She quickly spotted her beloved sitting nakedly in a pew. Of course, everyone else here was unclothed, but he seemed far more vulnerable than others. He looks at her, and then looks away. She can tell that he is uncomfortable seeing her this way, but maintains eye contact any way.



Even more than ever in his entire life, he feels exquisitely naked. Even though he fortunately isn't old enough to take part, he was required to attend without clothing. He looks away from her, not wanting to see. He can sense that she is staring at him, but doesn't want to look back. He sees that he isn't the only one who seems to be disinterested by the whole spectacle. The dwarven women, who, of course are the only ones clothed, sit by themselves and chat. The elder children are cavorting. Amy in a pink sash across one shoulder and her breasts maintain eye contact with him. Even in the throes of her actions, she has only eyes for him. He strays back toward the dames. "I think she likes you," cajoles his grand father. 

She imagines that he blushes. In the secret places of her girlish heart, she feels pity for him not being the same being of age; like her. By the time he is ready, she may have conceived a child. 

She would not know whose child it would be, yet could only regret that it would not be his. No! Can't think about that!

She hears a familiar voice speak to her. It asks her if she loves him. She looks down at her current mate and is a little surprised that she had paired herself with Jaste without recognizing him at first.

She sees him looking in the same direction as she and realizes he was asking her if she loved Ivor. She confides with him that she does. 

"That's alright. At least, now I can have the comfort that you were with me before him," he said. "Even though, in your heart, he would be your first." 

This strikes her as an odd thing for someone so young to say, although they are the same age. She thanks him. 
III
That Awful Night.

She feels dirty. She itched below the waist and endeavored to scratch with both hands. She scratched so hard that her hands had become covered in blood. She held them before her face, transfixed with an emotion which she could not readily identify. It chilled her already cold flesh and her hair seemed frozen onto her back so that she couldn�t move her head. Not ten minutes before, she had dipped her toe into the water to check its temperature and found it scolding hot. Never the less, she had thrown her nightgown into the fire before she extinguished it. This last was meant as a final rebellion against her parents. The garment had been new and was �the prettiest thing a young lady could ask for at her age,� as her mother so proudly said. In addition, it had cost her father �a pretty penny.� It had been purchased the very afternoon before her �disgraceful behavior.� She had meant to bathe this one last time before leaving forever.
Now, she could only stand here, shivering as if she were freezing. It occurred to her presently that the water could not have gotten so cold in such a short time. Even so, goose bumps became aroused on her soft slick skin. 
�Wherefore came this arousal,� she unknowingly asked herself. Her reply had been a sound which emanated behind her, a sort of chuckle. Yet she was here alone in the dark.
Alone in the dark. She couldn�t have possibly heard that, yet she was certain that she did. And this caused her to finally drop her gaze from her scarlet hands. She whispered a curse. The water within a foot circumference around where stood was now stained with her blood. She now launched into a frenzy of activity to finish up with her cleansing. No matter how hard she scrubbed, the blood wouldn�t come off. The phantom voice now laughed heartily at her expense.

�

He had risen from his slumber during the moonless nights between the Guardians' shifts, inching ever closer to that vile place. The house of "purity." 

He had risked his life without the protection of the Serpents, braving the wrath of the Galfaste in the pursuit of his meal.����������� 

He had waited in the shadows, watching with perverse pleasure while the Bitch Goddess bathed. She had no idea that she was being watched. He doubted if she would have cared is she had known.�� 
�
     
She leapt from the shallow end of the pool to the side of the pool with the grace of a cat, causing her body to animate itself in beatific ways. She then dives back in with the fluidity of a swan: her arms spread-eagled and ample chest heaved outward. 
     
It occurred to her that Ivor were seeing her now he would be shocked about the unconscious grace with which she carried herself when she was in private. Let him believe he had taught her to swim if he wished. She closed her eyes, anticipating a splash, yet was disappointed. She was not surprised to see that she had been caught in the arms of her first love. She had a moment to ponder the unexpected moments of bliss evident in her life, and that was her last. 
He picked his moment with the absolute skill of a born hunter and it was the exact moment that he struck. She had barely a second to recognize his face and her eyes betrayed an emotion of ecstatic joy that he found delicious. It was in the same instant that sank his teeth into the carotid artery of her neck and she all-at-once became a corpse within his embrace. Her blood was as purely nourishing and bountiful as her milk would ever be. What is mother's milk to a child without the blood that flows through the mother to fuel her beating heart? 



Author's Preamble for December 17 of 2015 for Darkling Romance. 

Okay, first of all, The old version of �Darkling Romance� started with the second chapter of the book and made the first book (originally called �Dove & Crow�) to be a little too short and end abruptly with the death of the �female� lead. So anyway, I hope the payoff is better with this event happening in the end of the first book and the second one being the payoff of events afterward. 

Summary: 

Have you ever met two completely different people who you wondered �how could they be related?� This is the case with a pair of twins (polar opposites) born atop a mountain in the village called �Lover's Climb.� The unpleasant death of an young woman whom one brother loved is murdered. 

By fate, both twins are only awake during an eclipse. Otherwise one is awake while the other is asleep. Did I mention that the one who sleeps during the day prefers a coffin? 









IV
Bleach wakes up from what seemed to be longest sleep of his life. He can remember everything from the previous day: from his pride in seeing Amy, dressed in a green skirt and a brown sash, as she entered the bathhouse on that special day. He laughed and waved fervently at her, wanting to congratulate her on her �graduation day,� yet she had not heard him. He then was shocked in her eagerness. He had felt� betrayed. Just two days before, he thought of her as his brother�s lover. But now, it would seem she was open to the general public. He� He� He loved her. How could she do this? Why?

Dismayed by these sacrilegious thoughts, her turns his face toward the window so that he bask in the light of dawn in attempt to cleanse his soul. He is surprised to see that the street is teaming with people at such an early hour. A group of easily twenty people prowls by, almost all seem to be holding torches in their left hands and daggers in their right. 

The group inspects each window and shadow while maintaining firm grips of both their torches and daggers. A man with a crossbow and another with a pitchfork walking abreast of each other closely follow them. "You, there, boy!" cries one woman in the group, her eyes wild, wearing only a modest bathrobe. "Have you seen a Darkling? Hey! Have you?" Speechless, Bleach can only shake his head. "Well, shutter that damn window and stay inside!!!"

Grampah crosses the room, closes the shutters, and engages the lock. He coughs into his hand, shaking his head. "I didn't want to frighten you, boy. A Darkling has visited our village... killed some chickens and goats and cattle. Go to the bathhouse, but be wary. Cry out if you hear or see something bad. I'll make your bed for you."

Bleach wanders cautiously through the street, fully clothed.� He stoops to pick up a good-sized rock to throw at an attacker. The walk to the bathhouse seems eternal. Something sinister lurks behind each and every shadow, just out of sight. However, each time he looks, there is nothing there. An owl hoots. A cloud passes over the face of the Blue Sun, limiting his Vision of the world. It would only be too easy for the malignant servants of the Dark Lord to infiltrate the city...

The door to the bathhouse creaks; there is no light within. Bleach stumbles in the dark to the large hearth in the corner, fumbles for a match, and lights the fire. Nothing in his young life could prepare what he sees in the newly illumed hall.

A black-robed creature, most certainly a Darkling from the Other World, hovers above the waters of the pool, which are stained crimson from the blood of his victim. 

"A serpent," Bleach gasps.

It bites deeply into the soft flesh of her throat, blood gushes out and into his mouth. There, enfolded in the Darkling's forceful embrace, her legs and arms thrashing, is Amy. The Darkling looks down onto the small, insignificant boy, and smiles. Its teeth are razor-sharp, and covered with gore.�

Its menacing eyes are large, reptilian ovals of obscene radiance. The body of a man; the face of a Serpent. An inordinately long and forked tongue lulled out of its mouth, licked at a drop of blood from Amy's slight breast. It flicked it at Bleach's face, where it ran down his left cheek like a crimson tear. Now, they both have tasted her blood.��� 

The Darkling lets go of Amy's corpse, which falls into the murky, red waters of Hell. With a final, sarcastic wave of its hand --- BYE-BYE --- it disappears into the shadows. 
     
Bleach, finally overcoming his paralysis, leaps into the water after her, floundering about like a fool. When he finally manages to locate her, he drags her lifeless corpse to the surface and out of the pool. The only thing he can think of doing is to attempt to suck out the creature's venom. Maybe she'll survive only if he could manage that. Perhaps it isn't too late; perhaps she'll live, or at least die in peace...

A woman screams. Jaste and Victor come charging in and beat him off of Amy's body with their fists. He tries to fight back, but Victor grabs his wrist in mid-air and pins it against his back and throws him into a wall. Immobilized, Jaste continues his onslaught only until his father stops him. Bleach gasps, Amy's blood still on his lips, and coughs weakly. "You bastard," cries Jaste, "You ki-ki-killed her. S-S-She l-l-l-loved you!!!" 

Several others burst in, as horrified as Bleach was by the Darkling's malice. What reason could a creature this evil have for such a deed? The mayor, brandishing a hot poker from the hearth, threatens Bleach with a disgusted hiss, 
     
"You vile creature! On the day you and that hell-born brother of yours came unto this world, we urged your Mother to destroy the child. It was pure evil, a horrible and twisted thing. Its eyes were enough to wither a man unfortunate enough to be caught in its gaze. However, she spared it. We thought he was the bad one. You were the good little boy. Oh, it seems that you are the worst of the two. Seemingly a good apple on the outside, but as rotten in the inside."

One man calls from behind him, "Run his brother through the heart with the poker and burn this one at the stake!" The rest of others agree immediately. 

"Yes, impale the Witch, burn the Vampire!!" cries the mayor, shaking the poker vehemently. Several men pick up Bleach and begin to carry him off on their shoulders as a sacrifice.

Suddenly, a blast of lightning streaks through the Heavens, which bedazzles the entire crowd. Standing in an electric corona, his staff held aloft, Grampah bellows unto the crowd, "RELEASE HIM! HEATHENS! OR FEEL THE WRATH OF THE SON OF DAV!" He swings his staff in a wide arc, cracking the head hard onto the ground; which causes an earth-moving tremor.

The mayor shakes his head and spits. "Leave us, Son of Dav. Justice is to be served. Like the justice which should of been bestowed upon the world the day you were birthed. They should have never been allowed to live with you on our soil,� he says. With quick inhalation of breath, he yells �THIS IS THE PROMISED LAND!" as if it were a battle cry and charges forward like a renegade bull.

The mayor raises the poker high above his head and swings it downward like a club, intending to bludgeon Grampah with it. Yet, the elder surprises him by catching the poker with a decrepit bare hand and counter-attacks with his staff. 

The mayor is thrown well over a dozen feet, sprawling into a cart full of horse dung. He popped straight up to his feet like a Jack-In-A-Box, turned on his heel, took a few skidding steps through the manure at the expense of his pride, and was streaking down the road in the exact opposite of direction which he�d been heading without uttering another word.

Few people if any marked his cowardly retreat, nor did any follow. All eyes were riveted on his opponent. "Well, if their only crime be to have set foot on your land, why not force them to leave YOUR land so they never will set foot upon YOUR soil again?" suggests Grampah, no longer shouting, but still holding the staff and poker. Intimidated by the old man's skills and anger, the people of Eden reluctantly elect to banish the brothers. 

The manure cart is loaded with Raven's Feather's "bed" --- a casket --- and a sickly nag is saddled. Ostensibly, no one had bothered to wash it out before doing so. A party of soldiers draws straws; those who pull the shortest ones must escort the infidels to the boundaries and make sure he never returns. 
     
Before they go, he is allowed to say farewell. None of the friends he has made care to speak with him, Jaste least of all. So, Grampah takes him aside for a moment, hugging an arm over the boy's shoulders as he weeps. He doesn't speak, just proffers his hand to the boy and they shake. 

As Bleach takes his own hand away, he notices something shiny in his palm. It looks like an icicle with a thin chain attached. He is about to ask what it is, but is silenced by a look and promptly stuffs his handkerchief in the boy's open palm so that no one notices what he was holding. 

"Now, I guess you will be leaving a little sooner than I had anticipated," says Grampah, ostensibly not being to particular about who over-hears him, as if he'd hadn't done anything suspicious. "Regardless of your age, you are now a man. I suggest you SWALLOW it and wipe those blasted tears from your face!" Bleach takes the cue immediately and swallows whatever he'd been given without a second thought. If they had been caught, it would not have boded well for either of them.

The march out of town is every bit as terrifying as the one to the bathhouse this morning. For, while he was familiar with the sprawling confines of the city, the persecuted has no knowledge of the outside world.

Damn these eight years of bliss, Bleach scolds himself harshly. Having never cared or even curious of what lies beyond, he finds himself thrust upon the world without. Damn them. Now you'll know, and you can't come back! Blind-folded, the soldiers guide him through town with a shove to his left shoulder to command him to turn left, a shove to the right to turn right, or a punch in the back to go straight. In his darkness, Bleach can acutely hear every yell, insult, and obscenity from the crowd who have lined up along both sides of the streets. 

At the brink of the town, the crowd's angry voice is replaced with a powerful roar. Stunned, the small boy freezes in his tracks like a statue. They're going to sacrifice me after all! Leading me into the den of some horrible creature! Oh no! Oh please! Not this way! Several of the soldiers laugh. One of the soldiers crouches down and unties the blindfold.������ 

A great wall, hundreds of feet in height, and miles long (and, no doubt, constructed of millions of stones and during a thousand years), stretches before him. Bleach looks about in awe, his shoulders steadied by the kneeling soldier before him so he can't turn around and look at the city behind him. 

"This, young witch, is the Wall of Galvador. What a perfect spy you were, never seeing such a glorious thing as this in your years as a Peeping Tom! Well, feast your eyes. This is the last time you will see the inside, and, for your sake, you'll never look upon these walls from the outside lest you want to be burnt," cajoles the soldier, a narrow- faced man with a curly beard and broad shoulders. 

"Never," agrees Bleach. "Fare thee well, Sire." The soldier laughs, pointing straight ahead. The wall is perfectly fortified, except a large, ten-foot gap in the middle. This great crack leads straight up the wall and is the only flaw. "Why is there no gate, Sire? How can you protect such a beautiful utopia so well with such a crack in its armor? Surely an evil horde could just march straight in whenever the please, yet I have never seen any march the streets."��� 

"Ha! HA! HA!" bellows the soldier. "Walk closer, boy, and look down." 
Bleach walks to the gap as he is asked, and sees beneath his feet a great waterfall, within an arm's length from the floor. "That is your answer, boy! Ha! You can ride your brother's box like a boat, and I'll lead your steed to the bottom. We can't allow you to ride upon the Road, so you'll have to go the wet way!!" A length of rope is tied around Bleach's ankle to anchor him onto the casket, and he is dumped into the water with it. 

The weight of the casket drags him below the surface. Bleach pops his head up, gasping in air, and is struck down again. He scrambles to the surface and attempts to wrestle his way on top of it, attempting to climb aboard and ride it like a wooden horse. The course is dizzying, continually banking left and right, than spirals upward; then surmounting and descending hills rapidly. It spirals up-and-over in three hundred and sixty degrees, then climbs straight up a steep hill. Just as suddenly as it began, the climb halts and dives straight down into a large pond.������ 

Gagging, Bleach drags himself out of the water and onto the shoreline. After a brief rest, he flounders out of the water and drags the casket onto the beach. Towering high above, somewhere in the Summit of Death Mountain, lays the Wall of Galvador, and behind it, the only home he knew.��� 
�
He sets the latch and opens the casket. Raven's Feather lies beneath a bath tub-full of water sound asleep. Bleach reaches beneath the waters and taps his sibling's shoulder lightly. Raven's Feather slowly sits up and climbs out, soaked to the bone, but stands straight as stone. Bleach isn�t surprised that he isn�t in the least shivering.������ 

"Y-Your casket's full of w-water," stammers Bleach in explanation. Raven's Feather is silent, his face covered in his shroud. He doesn't look at his brother, just straight ahead as if sleepwalking. Bleach coughs in his hand, "L-let's tip it over and let the water out." Raven's Feather heaves the casket onto its side, spraying a gush of water out and onto the floor.������ 
Bleach yawns. "I'll make a fire to keep us warm during the night. G'night," he says as he walks into the forest to get some sticks for firewood. He doesn't expect a reply, and doesn't get one. Raven's Feather never was talkative. 


Brief Interlude:
Damn them! Damn the world! When he had awakened from his slumber, he was cold and wet. The idiots from the city had discovered the slaughter and blamed his idiot brother, of all people. It had been perfect: the ultimate insult. Not only had he successfully murdered one of their mindless concubines, he�d also managed to destroy everything they believed in one fell swoop. After all his deeds, the stupid one gets credit. The stupid idiot was supposed to run through the streets, screaming and crying the loss of their bitch goddess. But, he was stupid enough to try and save her! Idiot!

Such an idiot that he actually left a letter to tell about his stupidity. "I was scared... A darkling with the face of a Serpent killed Amy. I dove in to save her..." Idiot. Raven's Feather was tempted to slice out the little idiot's throat and slake the Thirst with his brother's meager blood. But that would never do. No matter how much he hates the idiot, he must be kept him alive for the Purpose. Tonight he prowls, baked. He�ll bathe his way: in blood. 

V

Bleach awakens, rolled up in a blanket by the embers of a dying fire. He shivers. A knife. Stabbed into a nearby tree, bearing a message. Written over top of the letter he wrote to his brother, in blood, are the words:�� 

HOw DiD It TaStE?

� �Bleach shivers. This is obviously a letter from the darkling. Better tell Raven's Feather about it. His belly tenses up just then so he scampers into the brush to pee. There, laying behind a great bush with his throat torn out and ears and eyes and tongue cut off, no doubt with a knife, lays the kindly soldier. Written in the dirt, is another message:������� �

A LiTTlE SNAck!

Disgusted, Bleach retches. Feeling more than a little ashamed, he searches the body for possessions. He finds a stack of gold coins, a silver cross, a tin badge, food, a flask of ale, and a ten-inch long stick; easily the longest of the bunch which was drawn. He actually chose to escort me? Why?

Using the soldier's shield as a shovel, Bleach digs a shallow grave. He builds a modest cairn out of rock and marks it with a piece of wood. "FRIEND," is the only inscription he can think of.���

He gazes into the rays of the Suns, not seeking their warmth for the first time in his life, shivering fearfully and chastising himself for his life. �God�s Flower,� he thinks. �All of these years that I have thought that they had risen to welcome me into life. Oh should I haven�t seen the darkling eye that peered at me behind the veil of their warmth. Amy.�She was like the guilt for my mother wearing a costume... To lead from me being born up upon the mountain�s peak so I could gaze down on the world, then drop me like a stone into the black tides below! It is to weep.� 

These are not the thoughts of a small boy. Throughout his young life, ever since he was a year old, he would emulate his time in the womb --- the only time in his life when he was truly at peace. No temptation, and thus, no evil. Beneath his favorite blanket, the "Rainbow Child" one, he would curl up into a fetal ball; a homemade stethoscope clutched tightly, reverently, in his hand against his own heart. The sound of his own heart beat, the warmth of his own body heat trapped beneath the covers. Her preferred to sleep exactly how he did when he was in the womb. (His brother hated sleep. Despised it. It was a state of absolute weakness. He hated being weak. He hated mercy. He only loved to kill.)��� 

He sheds the clothing he had worn since the night before last, feeling filthy but not as enthusiastic as he always was. He wades into the cool and murky waters, his feet squelching in the mud. The water in the bathhouse was always heated and clear, thanks to the mountain springs that the foundation was built over. 

In recent years, the process of distillation has made the city of Eden a popular place to live, bathing in the pure waters to keep your skin clean, soft, and youthful. Indeed, it�s the Fountain of Youth. However, the town had always prospered on its agriculture. Surrounding the town on all sides was a forest of Licanthos, or "tear" trees.� This name comes from the fact that the climate in the forest was always the same and that it always rained. When the Lovers had encountered this strange place, they thought that the trees were weeping. Then, one day, it was all wiped out. That was the day Bleach had lost his mother.

Even though he was only half as old as he is know, and was just a small child, he can still vividly recall the events of that day.� He remembers the tin man and his mighty ax, who arose from the ----��� 

His train of thought is derailed by a shout from behind him, "Hey, there!" Startled, he spins on his heel, stumbling over his own feet, and falling face first into the water.�� 

He lifts his head from beneath the level of the water, reluctant to stand. After years of bathing in public, he shows modesty only in solitude. A burly soldier with a long, brown beard, his hands on his hips and laughing mightily, stands at the shore line. At his side rests an ax, handle up. From this vantage point, the man appears to tower above Bleach. "Stand, boy. C'mon, get up," says the soldier, turning his back to him.����� 
� 
Thankful for this consideration, Bleach stands up. He now sees that he is actually taller than the soldier, by at least two full inches. The soldier's hair is thick and braided behind the head. The soldier is wearing a steel, cone-shaped helmet, with great steer horns curling out and in with sharp points on the end. He looks like a goat, thinks Bleach. Without even looking, the soldier tosses a towel over his shoulder to Bleach, "Wrap it around your waist, boy."����� 
Bleach does so. Only afterward does the soldier turn to face him again. "So, you are the spawn of evil I hear tell of so often this day? I wonder why your self and your reputation are so conflicting? I hear of an albino demon that sees with blind eyes and walks among the people in the shape of a small boy. And now, I see only a small, defenseless, frail little boy. I also hear tale of the murder of a young and beautiful lass by a demon that walks the earth in the day. They say that the House of Purity's waters are now tainted with the gore, yet it is said that this girl lived a virtuous life. Is it her blood that taints the water so, or is it the malice of her death? No matter."���� 

Bleach coughs, paying complete attention to his elder, never interrupting, and only speaking when he's absolutely sure it is his turn to talk. "I am afraid so, Sir. Sir---?"��� 

The soldier laughs once again. He begins to stomp his foot happily, sending a miniature avalanche of dust into the water. "I am Zandegoz, which is dwarven for `hammer.' I am a dwarf, the last surviving guardsmen from the city of Garfod, the sister city of the Great Faghrod. I had fought bravely and wielded this here ax, the Hammer of Zandegoz, successfully felling nearly eight of the orkish host before I was struck down with a tree. Now, I am a hunter in these wilds, seeking the city behind the Wall of Galvador."�� 

"I am sorry, Sir Zandegoz. Both for your tragedy and your plight. For, while I had lived in that realm once, I now find myself in a state of banishment. Even if I were allowed to walk its streets again, which I now can't, it would be difficult to reach the city. I do not know the way up the mountain, and the way I have come," he indicates the waterfall, "is not accessible. There was a man who may have helped us, but he is not with us. I had awakened this morning only to find him dead and several taunting messages."�

Zandegoz crosses his arms, looking at Bleach degradingly. He snorts, blowing the whiskers of his face slightly. For the first time, he doesn't laugh, but merely stares. He hefts his ax and pats it on his hand. "`NOT WITH US?' Where is he, boy?� What have you done to him?"� 

Bleach, stricken by this dwarf's anger, sinks back a few steps in the water. He sobs. Annoyed, the dwarf advances a few steps, towering above a small boy, and his eyes ablaze with his anger. "I, um, he's uhhhh..." The dwarf advances, rushing the few remaining feet, cutting through the water like a shark, and grabs the small boy by the shoulders, shaking him like a rag doll. The towel falls from around his waist and into the water. "Spit it out," "The Hammer" warns, ignoring the boy's state of undress, staring straight into the boy's eyes as if they were windows into his soul. 
� 
Bleach sobs, his eyes watering.� "He's there!� In the bushes!"��� 
Zandegoz pulls Bleach out of the water by the hair, demanding to see where. "I was afraid of this, a demon child overcoming one of my men while he slept. I told that stupid Goff not to let his guard down and to make sure he wasn't seen, but he obviously didn't. I blame myself for your deeds." However, his mood soon changes back to jovial after he sees the soldier's grave. A cross of wood, bound with twine, holds the legend "Friend" neatly carved into the cross-section. The sword is laid out so the hilt is at the head and the blade at foot. 

The dwarf slaps the small boy on the back with burlesque affection, no longer roaring with rage, but with laughter. "You had me there, kid. You really did, I swear it! Ere, I could have broken your neck, and where would I be? Standing here, hotheaded and foolish, the blood of an innocent on my person. Only if that was the way war went, one side destroys the other, only to find that he's his own worst enemy. No revenge from the slain's kin, just self-desecration."� 

Bleach lies on the ground, shocked by this sudden development, humiliated for his own pessimism, again. First, his grand father kicks him in the ass, now this. His lays there, naked and bruised from the blow to his back, staring up at the laughing dwarf.����

�I thought that was it, he'd beat me and then make lean over a stump while he chopped off my head. Would my head roll off the stump and down the hill, watching my body dance around like a chicken with its head cut off? Would it of hurt? But, this? He's right, that life is the greater punishment.� His eyes shiny from tears of regret, Bleach once again meets the dwarf's gaze, whose eyes are wet with tears of joy.�� 
"I'm sorry I shouted, boy. I'm sorry. Truly. My friends call me Goz. I hope you are one of my friends," he kneels, holding out his hand to be shaken, holding his helmet to his heart with the other. Despite the complex braiding on the back of his head, the dwarf is as bald as polished stone on the top of his head. Branded into the skin of his scalp, on the peak of the bare patch, is a jaw-less skull.���� 

Bleach accepts the dwarf's hand graciously and his small hand is swallowed up by the dwarf's larger one. "My name, Sir Zandegoz... Goz, is Ivor the White, I am the son of the Goddess of Fertility. My father I have never known, as he was killed the Dark Lord's hand. My grand father, who was my father�s squire, raised me. You may call me Bleach. My brother is Ebon the Black, known as Raven's Feather."�� 

"Well, well, well! What a nice and proper mortal you be, boy. A scholarly old gentleman in the body of a boy. Yes, you are wise beyond your years, Master Ivor. So, where is this brother of yours. I hope he is as polite and respectful as you. Is he?" Goz laughs so hard that he appears on the brink of explosion. 

Bleach slips into the soiled clothes again and then leads Goz to see the casket. "There, Sir." The dwarf stands, his mouth hanging open, skin pale, he looks as old as Grampah, even older. He swallows hard. The lid of the casket opens and Raven's Feather sits up, his eyes covered with a handkerchief to protect them from the light. "Shut up! I'm trying to sleep," he shouts, then closes the casket again.���

Goz shakes his head to clear it. "I see that I wasn't disappointed. Your brother, he is so dark... he's your exact opposite. He sleeps during the day? Don't bother to explain. I guess I'd better help you lift that thing into the cart."� 


He sat in a furnace. He crouched in a gathering of flames so hot that they burned as they were a small pocket of hell upon the earth. He did not notice the fire, though. It did not burn him, nor did his face look as if he realized where he sat. He seemed as casual as if he�d been simply perched in the midst of a warm bath tub full of tepid water rather than in an inferno. 
His hands clasped his knees and the wrists were slit with thunder bolts of incisions and blood poured freely into his lap. Once in a while, he would hold his flayed wrists to his lips and drink of his own blood. The blood flowed and was endless, an ocean of scarlet stuff that was boiled by the flames as it rested in his lap. The hairs all over his body were aflame as well, as was the hair on his head. But, instead of screams of pain, his lips only loosed giggles of satisfaction and maniacal bouts of laughter. In between giggles and laughter, he chanted the same fragment of words incessantly.

 �Raven�s Feather from unwholesome fen� Raven�s Feather from unwholesome fen� Raven�s Feather from unwholesome fen� Raven�s Feather from unwholesome fen� Raven�s Feather from unwholesome fen� Raven�s Feather from unwholesome fen��

Cackling with laughter, seated casually in an inferno of flames that did not burn him, bleeding profusely from the wrists, genitals boiling in blood, he chanted.

He stared straight up towards the ceiling. Upon it, he�d drawn a five-pointed star --- a pentagram --- with his own blood, but it wasn�t long before he saw through the ceiling, though the pentagram stayed in his vision (reflecting the flames that did not burn him) and he could the night beyond and the moons above him in the dark.

�The Outcast.�

Later, after changing into a set of heavy clothing, the boy and the dwarf make their way down the heights of Death Mountain. Goz steers the nag with the reins while Bleach walks alongside the animal to coax it along. "Blasted nag," complains Goz. "This'll never get us anywhere. Blast those superstitious idiots!"� 

A hundred feet from its crest, the mountain is covered in snow and rises from the barren earth like the rib cage of some gargantuan beast which died long ago. The Lovers had escaped from the lower wastes to the mountain's peak, never even glancing back at the world below. To escape the mountain's curse, they climbed deeper into its recesses. For this reason, the city of Eden has been isolated from the rest of the world. Others gaze up at the mountain peaks at the aristocracy, the citizens only see the Wall they had built for their own protection.
� 

"Boy, I have traveled the world in search of the one true reward. I have lived under the shadow of evil, choking from the foul odor of its air, eating and drinking from its tainted succulence. One day, I was stricken down and looked up at the sky and saw, through the storm's eye, the peaks of Death Mountain. The hollow eyes of Devalcrag gazed down upon the world with the promise of irrevocable death. But, above that hated face, the Galfaste shone. I rolled aside, narrowly evading being cut in half by the sword of my adversary," proclaims The Hammer, standing before the campfire, holding sway over the conversation. They've traveled only an eighth of the way from the plateau, thanks to their aged nag.���� 

The Hammer steps to the side, miming battle, and slashes his ax horizontally to chop the top off of a nearby tree, "I clothed the beast's head off with one clean blow. Exhausted from my long day of bloodshed, I fell to the ground and crawled to a nearby stream, and thanked Kraken of the Seas for the fresh taste of his waters. My thirst slaked, I rolled onto my back and stared up at the Five. To them I prayed. Good night, young child. Sleep well and may the dream I have given you protect you from harm." The Suns of Galfaste disappear over the western horizon, and with them gone, Bleach embraces sleep.������ 

Another Interlude with the Vampire.������ 
A wolf howls in the distance. The Serpents streak the dark sky in search of their prey. Another howl, much closer than the first, comes from the east. The owl does not hoot, the rats do not squeak. Tonight is the wolf's reign. A shadow circles outside of the fire's glare, warding off the fiendish curs. A howl to the north. The shadow intercepts. The flash of metal, a retreating whimper.

The lid of the casket opens up silently and a bat flies out, leaving a trail of fire behind in its wake. Raven's Feather perches in a tree above the shadow's head. "Well, well, who might you be? Another one of my brother's friends?"

The shadow steps into the light of the fire, revealing itself as a dwarf with a great, horned helmet. "I am Zandegoz the Hammer, the last of the dwarven guardsmen. I am also your brother's guardian and mentor."

"Mentor, eh? What can a Stunted Person such as you offer to such a naive child in the ways of wisdom?�

�Actually, we prefer �stalwart,�� intoned Zandegoz, as if he were merely conversing at a fireside rather than caught in parlay with an opponent.

 �HA!" laughs Raven's Feather, clapping his hands together in ovation to something apparently funny in the dwarf's behavior. The dwarf advances, hefting his ax. "Oh, great Hammer-head, do you propose to chop the tree from beneath the mocking bird? Such wasted action while the bird flies away to roast once more. Do as you wish."

Zandegoz swings the Hammer in a wide arc, from right to left, cutting a deep gash in the tree's trunk. He pries his ax out and cuts another gash in the opposite side of the trunk. With a butt of his head, the tree topples over with a great thud. A bolt of fire passes over his shoulder, singing a few of the hair in his beard, and ignites the fallen tree on fire. Zandegoz spins to face the cowardly cretin who dares to attack him from behind. "Show yourself, Demon Spawn. How dare you attack when I'm looking the other way?!!?" A second bolt of fire comes down from above and scorches the ground at the dwarf's feet.

High up in a tree, Raven's Feather towers above his adversary. "So, vile tree killer, you are indeed foolish? Ha! Petty, petty, petty!" With each repetition of the word, the demon child thrusts out both hands, palms facing each other and fists half-curled, sending three successive bolts of flame at the wary dwarf.

 Zandegoz leaps over the first, parries the second, and ducks under the third. "Ha! Ha! Ha! Fool! Have you no idea that the dwarves are experts in evasion? Do we not win every game of dodge ball we are asked to play? Ha! Petty magic!" He laughs mightily, his boorish voice overshadowing the wolves' passionate cries to their masters. Slow to anger and slow to pacify, the dwarves are equally revered for their merriment.

Raven's Feather fires another volley: the first high; the second low; the third and forth from either side; and the fifth and sixth are catapulted with amazing speed, one on top of the other. Zandegoz ducks under the first and just barely manages to jump over the second. He stands his ground while the next two pass harmlessly by on either side, but is caught directly in the path of the last two, with no room to move.

Without a second thought, he flips straight up and over, taking the full force of the upper fire ball, but avoiding the lower one altogether. He falls to ground, his cape and hair on fire, and lands on his butt. Laughing mightily, Raven's Feather snaps his fingers and the fires are magically extinguished, leaving only scorched clothing and hair and the smell of something burnt.

"Farewell, Hammer. You have proven yourself to be a better warrior than I had thought. But not enough of one to vanquish me!" with this, he disappears into the night, levitating in thin air. Zandegoz lies on the ground, beaten and humiliated, but unwounded and alive. He rolls over and sleeps.

II
Bleach awakes with the Suns, but turns his back to them and faces westward. He cannot stand to see them any more. He chooses, just once, to sleep in a little. He covers his head with a pillow and curls up in the sleeping bag the people of the City had given him, a reluctant caterpillar unwilling to leave its cocoon and become a butter fly. Both items are worn from use, but they keep the chill wind off his back and somewhat insulate him from the cold.

Someone approaches, limping and favoring their right foot by the sound of their foot falls: thud! twap. Thud! twap. The pace is not that of an old man, but the careful gait of an injured soldier coming home from war. The person falls to their knees on the opposite side of the fire, warming their hands and rubbing them together. A rasping cough explodes from the stranger, who sighs and taps Bleach on the shoulder.

Since he was facing away from the suns, and therefore away from the fire, when the stranger had arrived, Bleach finds it hard to believe that they would know that he was awake. He decides to keep still. For the first time, the wounded stranger speaks: "Get up, boy. Food's gettin' cold!"

The boy instantly leaps from inside the covers like a projectile from a cannon, nearly tripping on his own feet and falling into the fire.

Zandegoz, Goz, kneels before him, like a servant before his lord, grievously wounded. Bleach leaps over the fire and tackles his dwarven friend, hugging him with almost ludicrously violent affection. The last two fingers on the dwarf's left hand are broken, his right eye is blackened, and even his helmet is dented in a few places. 

His clothes are torn in several places, and one of the sleeves on his shirt has been torn completely off. His cape and hair are singed. There's even a large bruise on his right knee.
� 
The Hammer coughs once more, holding a hand to his eye. "I was attacked by that darkling you have told me of, child. It awoke me and did this..." he hates to lie to the kid, but the fact is that he looks up to him and it is not the warrior's way to leave a battle unharmed. And never scared.

He had broken those two fingers by twisting them until they popped. He had punched himself in the eye, snapped a heavy log on his knee to wound it, and ripped his clothes by dragging them through a thorn patch. Only the damages to his cape, hair, and helmet are true. Now, is the time for Bleach to stare through his dwarven friend's eyes, into his soul.

"I never spoke of that in your company, Goz. Never shall I speak to any one of that horrible creature. Where have you heard? In the letter I had wrote to my brother?" He looks down at his hero, unnerved by the lies he has heard. The boy of ten glares down at the dwarf of countless millenniums of age, scornful with innocent regret. "What really happened?"

For a moment, Zandegoz's entire body is electrified with anger for being so easily seen through, but only for a moment. Afterward, he's solemn. He hangs his head as if the massive weight of his helm has just overwhelmed him. "I was awake, watching over you and the fire. I felt sorry for your friend who now lies in the earth's embrace, and perhaps a little afraid for my own fate. A creature clothed in entirely black attacked me from the shadows. It hurled flame at me from its finger tips, and in the end, it humiliated me.� I didn't want you to find out. Sorry."�

Bleach can sense more beneath this account, something which his stout friend attempts to keep secret for his own good, but chooses not to drag it out of him. Anything that important should be kept secret. They break camp and load the wagon, setting off for the day.

There had been a precipitous�blizzard earlier in the night; admittedly the first Bleach has ever seen. He had marveled at the millions upon thousands of crystalline flakes, each falling individually in droves like rain drops, yet so subtly dissimilar to that hitting the ground softly and freezing together. The ground did not puddle, like when it rains, but was covered in a frozen blanket, forming a "blanket". Goz had been skeptical of Bleach�s fascination, saying �A child who has not seen snow in his life is no child at all.� He had then taught him how to pack the snow into balls and toss them at each other, or to make a snowman by piling three big snowballs on top of each other. He also taught him how put it into a lidded pot and boil it, making fresh water from what he could find anywhere on the mountain if the need should arise if he had no other source handy.

During their trip, Zandegoz would ask many questions of Bleach. It was all too much for him. He was so caught up in the wonder of the snow to concentrate on the rasp of the dwarth's voice. He did note that not a single question dealt in geography. Most of his remarks would be of Grampah and the political policies of the city. Just as Bleach would warm up to a particular topic, Goz would move onto something else. It would seem that Goz enjoyed stringing him along in this manner.

Bleach, in much earnest, asked him what the �real� reason his taking it upon himself to meander in the direction of The Forbidden City, so high above the world on the top of the tallest mountain.� In reply Zandegoz had glanced sidelong at him for a shrewd interval before remarking, �Again, I must commend you for your perceptiveness.� Bleach didn�t reply. Zandegoz�s answer to the question was, cryptically enough, �I was looking for someone."���� 

"Who were you looking for?" Bleach wanted to know.

"A woman," was the answer. ��� 

"What was her name?" 

"I have no idea!" ��������� 

"If you didn't know her name, how did you expect to find her?"� 

"I just knew she would be up there."����� 

"Why were you looking for her?"���������� 
This garnered Bleach what he inferred to be the most abstract answer he could wish for. Zandegoz had answered the question with one of his own: 
"Why else would a man be looking for woman?"���� 

Bleach had no idea. But, he guessed the reason. "If you weren't pursuing any particular woman, why did you have to go to the city to find one?"���������� 

"There weren't any women where I lived." Before he could be asked yet another question, Zandegoz quickly went on, �I will explain to you this much. Dwarves are solitary fellows. Nothing pleases them more than to spend hours in the dark smithying or to stroll through the halls of his home; enthralled with their beauty.� Battles are the evils which we face, for this is where a dwarth may truly enjoy the opportunity as a chance to display his arms. In war or peace, we as a people savor each moment of our lives and never tire; whether or time is spent smithying (where each deliberate stroke of the hammer is in exacting detail) or in the battle-field (which also benefits from our attentiveness). Victories are the stuff of legends, defeats soon avenged, thereby leading to another victory. We rarely bathe, if I might say,� at this he stopped, stroking his beard thoughtfully for a moment. 

�As this would attest, we are a people who groom not as well as others would wish. There are no mirrors in our mansions, nor does [anyone] {a man} wish to have one. Vanity is a frivolity with which we do not hold with. When we do wash, it is always our beards and hands. The women long ago sundered themselves from the men. Most of us hardly entertained the question of why when they had left. It had just been accepted by silent agreement into our culture.� 

Zandegoz lapses in a thoughtful silence for a moment. He says, almost completely to himself, �I cannot imagine why anyone would find it necessary to find refuge on such a place as this. It is a bad omen that safety should be found in the heart of danger.�

Bleach questions this, �Why should you say that? What better place than Lover�s Climb?�
Goz laughs so heartily at this that the very hills about them shake and tremble, cannot reply. He only laughs until he can stop himself by force of will alone, but is too late. A drift of snow falls from the hill and they run with it at their heels until they find refuge beneath an overhanging cliff. �We may have paid dearly for your jest.� We might just have paid for it with our lives.� Bleach is about to protest but is overridden. �Forgive me, young one. I often forget your being naive. I had been the one to laugh, after all. I had taken as an incredibly good joke, forgetting you yourself had lived there. This is not, as you had said �Lover�s Climb.� Lover�s Climb is all over the world we live in. It is Lover�s Climb wherever lover decided to climb on top of each other! 

�Did you think I had been carven from stone or grown from the earth as trees do? It is my regret that the women my should people should think as you do. The true name of this place is Devalcrag. �The Mountain of Death.� Once it had been called �Proud Head� for upon it the faces of the great lords of old had been carven here, but that day is long ago. One of the great cataclysms of ancient days had claimed the lives of all that had lived of the mountain dwellers of my people had died off in that ancient tragedy. Only those of us who had been poor and indentured to work in the caves to find jewels for the wealthy citizens of the heights baubles had survived. Only fools seek to live upon mountains any more. Should another such tragedy occur, my people would have no hope of survival since all our blasted women live up there in bliss and pious ignorance.� 
�
"At this time, I feel that I must apologize, young friend, for not being more forthwith earlier. You must understand that I was adhering to the Dwarven Code of Honor. The first thing a male child learns, way before how to walk or talk, even before he can crawl, is that honor is everything. His father slaps him, across the face. The child is provoked throughout its life in a similar fashion, the resentment in its heart for that abuse growing deeper and deeper. At your age, the child is honor-bound to vent its anger in the Competition. Once he has defeated his father, then he may pursue a wife. I must admit that what I had really hoped for was a son."

Dumbfounded, Bleach, who had been running along side the nag as usual, freezes in mid-stride and stands still. As a result, the old nag snorts and plants a-big-wet-one on his lips. He solemnly wipes the slobber off of his face, not as moved by this form of animal affection as what Goz has just said. �Goz, I apologize, too. I trust you, but not merely as an elder, but as a friend. I never had known my father, and I had lost mother, along with the forest which she had tended. When I was very young, the forest had been destroyed. I don�t wish to speak of what had happened at this time, not even with you. It still hurts when I think of that tragedy.

Zandegoz pulls back on the reins and says "whoa," signaling the nag to halt. He climbs out of the seat and hugs the small child mightily. "That's okay, Ivor of the White, son of the Green Mother. Yes, I know of your mother, and I know of you. I had also heard of the wood of which you speak, yet do not name. Am I right in assuming this was the famous glen of Licanthos? I must admit that I had believed it to still be in bloom. During the time of my journeys, I lived on the road, earning a shilling here and there doing odd jobs. On the day of the commotion, I had finally reached the outskirts of town, yet was in quandary since I could find no way in. 

�I had made camp for the night and was just thinking of leaving when that soldier friend of yours arrived.� He was driving this very cart. I waylaid him and begged for food. I am not the great adventurer your father was, as I heard in legends. But, in my youth, I was close. Very close! As luck would have it that soldier friend of yours was drunk and wanted a friend to accompany him. So drunk that he was willing to speak with filthy old dwarf such as I am.

"He told me of your birth and your crimes, and of your brother. He cursed his captain for ordering on this �fool's errand,� as he called it. `Let the ungrateful bastard die in the wilds,' was what he said of you. After a while, he grew tired of talking about his woes and asked me to go away." He stares out into a small cluster of leaf-barren trees, wondering of what the Forest of Tears had once been like. Bleach hugs him back, and this is how they stand for the next hour, two good friends in each other's embrace.
�
�
Later, they sit side-by-side on the wagon's seat, half a mile from their last stop. Bleach holds his hand to his face and sighs. Zandegoz is compelled to do the same. "Goz...?"
"Yes, friend? What is it?"

"I was wondering... how old are you? I mean, were you when Faghrod was attacked? You don't have to answer, I was just curious. How old were you?" asks the small boy timidly, eager for an answer, but respectful enough not to pry. The nag's hooves thud in the snowy road, the wheels creak and swish as they roll through the powder. 

"So, it's come to my past, eh? Well, as you know, that was centuries before you were born. As for the first question, I am 1,200 years old." Bleach gapes comically, taken completely aback. "Ha! Ha! Ha! So, that seems old to you, does it? Well, let me tell you my father lived until he was seven thousand years old. Now, keep in mind that dwarves age slower than men. A dwarf a hundred years old is as healthy as a boy one-tenth his age. So, when a dwarf is 200 years old, he is in the same shape as a twenty-year old man. Since the Massacre happened 1100 years ago, I've already answered your question---" (Bleach figures 190 in his head) "---, right?"

"Right. So, I'd have to wait until I'm a century old to compete in the competition? Why do you wait so long to contest you father?"

Zandegoz the Hammer, former warrior and then beggar, laughs so hard that it sounds like thunder. Bleach feels like his head would explode. "Sorry, but your question was just so innocent that I couldn't resist. That is why I am called Zandegoz, or `Hammer of the Gods' in your tongue. The dwarves believe that when it rains, the sweat of some great smithy in the sky falls upon us. The lightning is the spark of his great hammer striking metal, the thunder the clap of steel on steel.

�No, lad. You won't have to be a century old before you can fight your father. Say you and dwarf were born on the same day, next door to each other. When you have your first birthday, he has his. When you come over to his house to play at the age of 10, he wouldn't be an infant, or someone twice as old as you. He'd be ten, too. The only difference is that dwarves are capable of living a much slower pace than humans. You may be capable of laughing and jumping and running more frequently than your dwarf friend at the age of ten, but you will be an old man by one-hundred. He, on the other hand, will be just as able to do all those things at 100 just as energetically you when you were 10!"

Bleach is silent, mulling this information over in his head. Dwarves age one-tenth as slow as humans. At the age of 10 the child challenges his father to a competition. What kind of competition? A foot race? Arm wrestling? Boulder, Parchment, Shears? Am I old enough now, or do I have to wait until I'm an old man since I'm not dwarven? Who can I challenge? Zandegoz is grim, allowing the child to work up his dander enough to ask the question which he's been trying to ask. �

The quiet is interrupted by a horrible bray of laughter, originating from behind them, among the trees which they had just passed ten minuets ago. Zandegoz looks back over his left shoulder and swears he can see a pair of luminous eyes, peering at him evilly from among the shadows. Approaching them and passing, the trees had been tall and proud, their branches naked, but never the less healthy looking. Now, cruel faces seem to be carved into the tree trunks, the branches twisted forward like groping arms. Not wanting to embrace, but to grab someone by the throat and throttle them.

Zandegoz slowly turns his head away from the ghastly sight, afraid of what else he might see. Unlike the dwarf, Bleach had not dared to look forward, but just buried his face in his hands and cried. Zandegoz ruffles his snow-white hair playfully, to no avail. "L-l-look," whispers Bleach,

"Look at the floor." Humoring the child, he looks down at the floor of the cart, not expecting to see a thing. There, between Bleach's left foot and his right, a message is carved into the wood:

�ThE bItcH goDDess' bLood 
was sWEEt.
YoUr frIenD's
biTTer. 
HoW wiLL your's TasTe? \
PeRhaps it will be as

III

Bleach awakes with the Suns. He doesn't turn away this time, nor turn towards them, but decides to face straight up so that darkness and light could each lay claim to him. Zandegoz stands before the crackling fire, his so- called wounds forgotten. This is the day, Bleach tells himself. Before he can stop himself, he asks the Question: "Zandegoz, am I old enough, now, to compete? I don't know my father, and he's not alive... but, can you teach me?"

The Hammer laughs, not in a belittling or in jest, but as a show of great relief. For the first time, Bleach finds himself chiming in. Soon, the both of them laughing like pair of lunatics, causing the distant peeks of the mountain to shake and rumble. Zandegoz's mighty laugh is over-ruled by a thundering groan, as if some great snow beast's rest has been disturbed by the raucous. "Ah, Son-Child (if you don't mind this title I give you), you are more than old enough, but the most qualified child I've ever seen. I have never been a father, and you have no real experience at being a son... but if I had a child, it would have been like you, regardless if it had a beard or not. I accept your challenge. Come, I will teach you the Way of the Warrior."

They disembark from camp on foot, the dwarf leading the small boy, and march about the camp until Zandegoz spots a high mound of snow, towering high above the rest of the snow.

He tells Bleach at the bottom while he clambers to the top of the snow mound.
	
"This is the most celebrated of the games our dwarven children play. Each game teaches them a particular skill in battle which they must learn. This one is called `Mogulaur*' or `King of the Mountain.' You must climb up the mound and throw me off to become the winner. However, I have the advantage of already being at the top before you, while you must use at least a small sum of your strength to get up here. That, and the fact that I'm older, more experienced, and heavier than you. Engarde, Sun Child."

Bleach races to the top, eager for his encounter with the enthroned dwarf. Zandegoz swats him down like a fly, sending the impetuous youth sprawling into the slushy floor. The second time, he zigzags from side to side, taking longer to reach the top. He strays a foot below the dwarf, out of his reach, until he can find an opening.

"C'mon, boy, Engarde!" hisses Zandegoz impatiently. He stamps his right foot and it slips on the icy surface of the mound, causing him to loose his balance for a moment. Bleach sees his opening and strikes. He rushes forward, and abruptly circles to his right so he could approach from just behind and out of the grasp of the dwarf's non-dominant left hand.

Zandegoz balls up his right fist and punches across his body at Bleach, but the boy dodges to the side and kicks him in the underside of his left knee. Zandegoz stumbles backward on the verge of falling, but stands his ground at last. He retreats a few feet down the mound, allowing Bleach to gain the top. The Hammer feints to his left, then jabs with his right, catching Bleach in the mouth.

Bleach counter-attacks with a punch of his own, but swings too high. Zandegoz ducks this easily and kicks the boy in the stomach with his left foot, doubling him over. He rushes behind him and applies a full nelson by shooting his arms under the boy's armpits and hooking his hands behind his head. "Give up? Do you, boy? Submit!! Nobody's ever broken my Hammer Lock! Give up!"

Bleach lifts his arms in a sign of surrender, so Zandegoz lets off a little pressure, but doesn't attempt to break the hold prematurely. As quick as a snake, Bleach grabs Zandegoz's head with his right arm and pitches his weight forward, hurling the dwarf over his shoulder and into the snowy floor below.

Defeated! Cold and wet from his splash around in the snow, he shivers not only because of the inclement weather, but also from a draft emanating from within. Defeated and humiliated! I, the Hammer, the bane of cowards, an asset to heroism, was defeated in the competition my a mere human child. Sure, that other one was different, his soul was dark and evil, surely of the Dav-Torve order. Maybe even the Prince of Darkness, the Dark Lord's son posing as this young boy's sibling. There was no way that Zandegoz, no matter how virtuous he was, could have ever defeated such an epitome of evil.

But, this is different! He had expected the young boy to be easily discouraged. He had planed on whittling down the child's self-confidence, discouraging him little by little Then, finally, taking a fall just so the kid would at least think he had won fairly. However, this was not foreseen. Never! I AM THE HAMMER! NO ONE! NO ONE! NO ONE!!!! HAS EVER BEATEN ME!!!!!! NO ONE! NEVER! EVER!
	
At first beaming brightly, then downcast in shame for his joy, the boy slowly slumps down from the ice mound and offers his mentor a helping hand. "I'm sorry. So sorry, Goz. Sir."
	
Laying at the feet of the human child, bickering at himself, Zandegoz is finally brought out of his misery by this child's apology. He takes the boy's hand, not as a support, but as a sign of congratulations. Kneeling at the boy's feet, he takes the child's out-stretched hand and shakes it vehemently in both of his.
	
"You must never apologize for being the victor in a conflict, Bleach," he says, using the boy's first name for perhaps the first time since he met him. "Nor must you turn your back to him in disgust. Both of these are great disadvantages. Only a fool would do either." He relinquishes his grasp and stands by his own vocation, then puts his hands on the boy's shoulders while he looks into his eyes in admiration. "Where did you learn that?"
	
Proud of himself, Bleach smiles from ear to ear, his wan face aglow with the youthful beauty from within. He brushes his white hair away from his eyes, blushing. "I learned it from my grand father, Sire. He isn't really my grand father, but that's what he likes to be called: `Grampah.' He was the only survivor of the Massacre of Faghrod, so he joined my father to seek retribution." 
	
Excited, he shakes the boy heartily. "Faghrod!?! You mean he was actually in the City of the People during the attack? Who is he?! Tell me, who? Is he dwarf? A dwarf warrior?� Tell me!!!" He explodes with immense joy, shaking the child like a rag doll in his anxiousness for enlightenment. I wasn't the only one! I was not the only survivor!! Perhaps it�s none other than old Bleakthorns himself, the old devil! 
	
"N-N-no, sir. He's not dwarf. Although he does have a beard. In fact, he's half dwelve and half ork. His name's Davik the Accursed. But he has proven himself in battle---" before he can finish, Zandegoz throws him aside in angst.

"`Half ork'!!? You are in league with a Dav-Torve? You are the demon you are said to be. YOU! I climbed Devalcrag only to be assailed by your lies. I have failed the Galfaste, lured by your profane deceit." He towers above the fallen Bleach, a murderous look in his insane eyes. He rips out two handfuls of hair from his beard by the roots, his cheeks bleeding. "I-I-I'll put an end to your lies."

Just then, a volley of flaming arrows is fired upon them, like the breath of a wrathful dragon. One of them strikes the dwarf in the underside of his knee, another hits his left shoulder blade. He falls atop the frightened Bleach. He rolls back and forth in the snow to smother the flames, breaking the shafts off of the arrows. "Run, boy, run! It's an army of elves. Run!"

Bleach scampers to his feet, stupidly looking all over to assess where their attackers were. Ten yards off, there is another bunch of trees. He gets a glimpse of tall, slender creature clad in leaves, loading his bow with another arrow. This one flies straight for the cart and Raven's Feather's casket immediately bursts into flames. "Brother!" Zandegoz kicks at his ankle and screams above the roar of the fires, "Run, damn you, run!"
	
With the raging fire as a backdrop, the young boy seems to overrule the scavenging, hateful flames with radiance within --- seemingly its master. His thin, translucent lips parted in a gape of fear and surprise; his phantasmal, pupil-less eyes staring at the cremation of his brother... the child is the picture of divinity. Childish in emotion and thought, aged in appearance, he seems as eternal as the Cycle of the Heavens.
	
Those specter's eyes seem to shift their gaze toward the trees, even though the whiteness of them doesn't change; only intensifying. He faces their elven sniper, the cool tears of grief evaporating from along his cheeks, his eyes blazing and white-hot. The elf stares into those eyes, as dazzled and frightened as he would be of a Serpent's, and they turn blood shot from the smoke. Within those eyes, he sees both his salvation and death.

Bleach about-faces and runs, following the dwarf's orders finally. Thankful for not having to look into those eyes any more, the elf sighs. He is confident that the tree-killer has learned his lesson; it is not his job to decide another's fate.

IV

He lays upon his bed, spinning as if in a revolving door. High above, God's Flower smiles down upon him. Behind her, the Four are locked in fierce combat with a Black Host. She loves him, not them. Him. Are you my mother? Are you? If not, where is ---       
	
My Mother? A phalanx of explosive thunder roars through the sky, the Hammer of the Gods striking upon the precious metal of the earth.  A metallic, almost assuredly amplified bellow commands the heavens: "Grinnn-LAB! GRIN-LAB!!!!!" Chug! Chug! Chug! With a hiss of escaping steam as if from a coffee pot and few mechanical ticks and tocks of an old clock, the behemoth raises its long-handled wedge in the air and swings it, cutting through the thick air lick a knife: Swish!
       
The wedge digs into the bark of the tree with a hollow thunk! Wood chips explode forth like shrapnel and reddish sap bleeds from the tree like a torrent of dried blood. Holding its great hammer in its other hand, Grinlab swings in a wide, over-head arc. Once again, there is thunder. "Grin- Lab chop!!"       

Half a decade ago, when the brothers were both five, they watched their mother die. A metallic giant, as tall as the mountain itself, its body composed entirely of armor, emerges from the south. A cloud of steam trails from behind it, as if the peak of its hat had snagged a cloud. It rolls rather than walks on tread, the technological equivalent of a centaur; humanoid from waist up, tank from below.       

"Grrrr-INNNnnnn-Labbb!!!!!" Its voice is metallic thunder, reverberating and amplified to the mighty cry of a Titan. He lifts up the felled tree, rips out all of the limbs, and tosses them into a furnace set into its chest. Each trunk is split into quarters and fed into the furnace to fuel the fires within. Several times, once every two hours, Grinlab stoops over a nearby stream and drinks. He does this, not because he's thirsty, but as a way to cool down the mechanics within.       

A column of air strikes the giant from behind, covering it with leaves and dirt.  "Be gone!" shouts a woman's voice from behind. Grinlab regains his balance with difficulty and glowers at its assailant. A woman hovers over the roof of the forest, in the eye of a hurricane. She is dressed in a gown of leaves, her legs, long and graceful, naked from the mid- thigh. Her hair is a deep forest green and splays out around her head and stretches to her feet like a hooded cape. Her face is soft and beautiful, with olive colored skin, full lips, and a petite nose.  Her eyes are, naturally, pine green.       

"Grinlab! Who dares challenge the wrath of Grinlab?" bellows the tin man, clutching his great hammer in his right hand and slapping the head in his left palm. The Green Woman unleashes another volley of wind, but Grinlab stands his ground. Her only asset was surprise; he will not be tripped up again.       

The woman shakes her head fiercely, sending her hair fluttering about like the leaves of a tree in a fierce breeze. "No, heathen, you were the one who attacked first. These are my woods, my children. Leave or be destroyed by my wrath!" She claps her hands together and the trees about Grinlab seem to come alive. They knock away his hateful tools and pin his arms behind his back. "Do you yield, Interloper?"       

In answer, Grinlab's arms snap off at the shoulders and he rushes away, leaving the trees with his disembodied limbs. The trees uproot themselves and follow close behind the fleeing tin man in the sluggish, drunken gait of old men. Grinlab is soon cornered against the Great Wall. The Green Woman unleashes the full wrath of her hurricane, which lift him straight up into the heavens and throw him to unforgiving ground below.       

Grinlab crashes into the ground, forming great canyon in the earth in the shape of his spread eagled form.  Broken, he utters one last "Grinlab" before he self destructs into a thousand pieces.       

For a moment there was peace. For a moment, the women of the city sang; the children danced and laughed; the elder began his record of the Forest's Triumph over machine; the Festival of Peace which had been parading the streets of the town before the turmoil began resumed its march. For a moment, the Green Mother tucked her child in bed.       

But only for a moment. The pieces of the giant began to glow and lifted up into the air of their own accord. They spun around in figure eight formation, mimicking the orbit of the Five. In the center of the whirling scrap metal, a new metallic giant was formed. Grinlab's head and torso were all that remained of its old manifestation. From each shoulder stretched out three massive arms, all joined together by a single scythe-like half-moon cutting blade where the hands should have been. Grinlab's old pair of arms which he had abandoned earlier joined together at his hips, forming two hand-footed legs.       

He spun like a top on his "hands." The Titanium Tornado spun wildly, demolishing anything in its path. The mighty trees were beheaded even as their feet were cut off from underneath them. Dismayed, they fell to the ground ten at a time, like so many broken match sticks.

However, they did not lay bleeding in defeat for long. Even as it felled the trees, Grinlab busied itself by scooping them up with its feet and depositing them into its fiery mouth. A black cloud surrounded the mass of spinning metal, obscuring it from the eye. If the skies had wept joyfully before in peace, they now wept with acidic tears of grief in defeat. Their tears fell to the ground in a thunderous rush of water, flooding the sewers beneath the city and forcing the citizens to higher ground.       

Without the trees to tend over, Bleach's mother was useless. In return for her cultivating and tending them, they, in turn, cultivated and tended her. She grieved for several days and died.       
Mother, sobs Bleach in his sleep. God's Flower smiled upon her adoptive son in his cradle, but he could only see his wicked step mother, laughing at his dismay.



Author's Preamble for December 17 of 2015 to �Pride before a Flight.� 

The previous book in the series (Darkling Romance) tells tale of Bleach being exiled from the village of Lover's Climb where he meets a dwarth named �Goz� who is on his way to the village itself. Having no idea how to even get into the place, the dwarth is content with taking Bleach with him as a surrogate son. 

They are attacked by an elf firing flaming arrows at them and Bleach believes that Goz is killed along with his own helpless brother. In his dreams, he relives the day his mother is killed by a robotic logging machine.

V
       
A rooster cock-a-doodle-doos somewhere in the world beyond the one in which he sleeps. Cock-a-doodle-do!!! How long had he known of these birds and this peculiar cry? All of his life? And he had never actually heard it himself? He had heard his friends impersonating this cry on many an occasion. But he, himself, had always been ignorant it. Bleach blinks his eyes and rolls over, nearly falling right out of the crotch of a tree.       

A soft hand touches his shoulder and pulls him back into place. "Be careful, child. Otherwise, you'd fall." The voice is as soft as the hand which now caresses his cheek. Bleach looks up and sees a woman, dressed in leaves, with soft green eyes and long, narrow ears. He starts, but settles down again. For a moment, she had looked like his mother.       
	
****Her face is too angular, her nose a shade too hawkish, her lips not as full. His mother was beautiful, but this woman is just handsome. Pretty, maybe, by mortal standards, but his mother was a goddess of heart, mind, and body. Her voice is melodic, charming. Like the song of a flute.       Bleach rolls over, careful this time, and looks up at her as she brushes his hair with her hands. Her hair is bluish green, completely unlike his mother's, but still beautiful enough. "So I see that the young boy is now as sweet awake as asleep," chimes the woman.       
	
He nuzzles into her caress and rests his weary head in her lap.  "Thank you, ma'am. May I say that you, as well, are beautiful? May I also ask what race of creatures has spawned such a vision?" he asks, his eyes closed and dreaming.       

"Why thank you, child. While I would to know where you are from, too, you did ask first: my answer is that I am Lady Phyllis, Princess of the Dryads (the Tree People). I am an elf," she says. Bleach yelps in surprise, "AN ELF!", and a scoots away, forgetting the height in his haste.  This time, he does fall out of the tree.       
	
He falls to his almost certain death, wide eyed and paralyzed with fear as the ground seems to rush up at him, eager to dose out his insignificant life. Fortunately, an elven warrior just happens to rush out from his guard post behind some bushes and catch him. The warrior is of tremendous height, at least seven feet fall, wearing the hollow bark of a tree as armor and a bow strung over his across his right shoulder. He holds Bleach like a baby, dwarfing him (pardon the expression) more than any man ever could.       

The elf lifts his head to the trees above and cock-a-doodle-doos. So, that's what I heard! Thinks Bleach indignantly. A rope ladder unfurls from above, seemingly from thin air. From the ground, the place from which he fell is virtually invisible. The elf looks down at Bleach in his arms. "You might as well use that, you clumsy human child. You know that you were lucky to have missed all of the branches on your way down, do you?"       
	
Just as he lets him down, Bleach tries to run away, but the elf grabs and strings him over his left shoulder. With uncanny agility, the elf climbs the rope ladder, one handed, in a graceful and swift pace. One minute he was standing on the ground, the next, he was a hundred feet up.       The elf kneels over so that Bleach could climb back into the tree's crotch safely. The meet eyes and recognize each other instantly: Bleach's barren and the sniper's sea-green. The elf laughs a reedy laugh. Bleach only snickers.       
	
Do you know each other?" asks the elven woman. She darts her eyes back and forth between them, wary of their differing expressions: pleasure and disgust.       
	
"You!" snaps Bleach at the warrior. "You ambushed me and Goz! You fiend!!"       
	
�Cool down, boy, or I would have to drop you back where you came from. After all, you are my guest! I was not the aggressor, boy. He had murdered a tree mercilessly with his hateful ax. It was not dead, but still alive and well. It is a sin to smite the life out of another living thing, in peace or war."       
	
Bleach subsides into tears, "You should talk, Elf!  For one who is so pure to live in the trees, but is adorned in their skin. What honor is there in cowardice? Who respects he who does not attempt to protect himself?"       

"You misunderstand. We elves live in the trees, in deed. However, we do not kill them for our purposes. We only remove the dead who have completed the journey of live so they would not waylay those still alive.       
	
�There is no honor in aggression, nor in pacification. If an enemy threatens us, we fight back. We do not attack his villages and threaten the women and children who are not on the battle field like the vile orks. We smite their menace from a distance. So, if an army insists on charging into the path of our arrows, so be it! We choose to fire, but they choose to be fired at!" the elf pounds one fist into the other palm: Whap! "We are the wall... they are the battering ram!!"       
	
Lady Phyllis, the elven woman, chooses to cast down her shroud of silence, "Sorry to interrupt, husband, but our friend hasn't introduced himself to us, nor have you to him."       

Bleach looks up into her warm, green eyes, and is thankful. He was beginning to lose the debate. Darn. "Thank you, Lady..." he searches for her name, then finds it, "...Phyllis. Once again, I must compliment you for your voice, you have pulled me out of the frying pan and into the fire, as my grand father would say. My name, forgive my rudeness, is Ivor the White, son of Alcrad. You may call me Bleach, for that is what my friends call me." He holds out his small hand to be accepted by the elf's larger one.       
	
The elven warrior laughs his reedy laugh again, delighted. "You are Alcrad's son? For the legends I have heard of you, you are more welcome here than you would be if you were what you are said to be! I have heard that the son of Alcrad was demon, dressed in black, with the eyes of death. `He wears a cape to shield his body from the rays of the sun which will surely harm him more than a sword. His fangs are great and vicious, to great advantage for ripping the throats out of his unwary victims. The son of Dav is his teacher, evil his master. He runs with the Serpents,' say the stories of his life."       
	
"Yes, I am the son of Alcrad, sir. But I am not the only one. The one you speak of is my brother, Ebon. I question the tales of who he perceives as master and of his teeth, but he dresses so. And, in deed, he walks the land during the night." For one instant, the virile elf seems to wither like a dead tree. "Who, sir, are you?" asks Bleach, impatient for the braggart to tell his name.       

"My name? Oh! I forgot, sorry. My name is Timbre. Tell me, is this Ebon your older brother? Was it he who was born during the Equinox, or was it you? I find it strange how he was so highly spoken of while you, on the other hand, are a completely ignored. There are no tales of your doing neither evil deeds, nor any of your good ones as well. Why is this?" Timbre lays down along a thick branch, straddling it with both legs and locking his feet together.       

Bleach stirs uncomfortably, wary of both the great height and this creature's odd gaze. His mother had eyes like his, but her gaze was always soft and loving. The woman has passing resemblance, but this man (if elves could be called "men") bears an uncanny resemblance. Could it be she, too, was an elf? "No, sir. I, like my brother, was born during an Equinox, ten years ago. We're twins. Ever since birth, I have been as wan as you see me now. I was born `old' and will die `old.'       

"My brother, on the other hand, is tall, dark, and raven haired. It is a common mistake; you�re thinking he's older because of his looks. However, he is not with us any more. You mustn't worry. Because YOU killed him. You set fire to our wagon AND his casket! And, sir, I would like to know how it is I somehow went to sleep the day of YOUR ambush and woke up here!?!" he lashes out with his sharp tongue, poisoning the elf with the venom of his dislike. Unlike his dwarven friend, Bleach has learned to bury his bad feelings deep within himself, taping it only in situations of need.

Stricken, the elven warrior, twice his height and nearly a thousand years older, perhaps, is silenced. He had arrogantly laid back and crossed his arms, but now he shoots forward, at attention. Phyllis, dutifully covering for her husband's silence, answers for him, "I'm sorry I did not tell you, child. My husband tells me that you had attempted to escape, though it was unnecessary. You ran away, tripping over your own feet in your haste. He had followed at a safe distance, concerned for your welfare. He did not stalk you, but followed as a guardian from danger." She pauses.

Timbre takes up the slack, thankful for his wife's intervention, "You had run nearly a mile down the slope, while I followed at steady pace and tracked your steps in the snow. They were far apart, easily distinguished. It looked as if you had run, stumbling along, falling down to your knees frequently and getting back up again.      
	
�You had reached a frozen stream and slipped. You fell and started rolling down a hill, accumulating more snow as you went. I found you two days later, near the bottom. You had caused an avalanche and were almost completely buried in snow. I would never have found you if not for the smell of your blood and your bruised form. You were fortunate for being on the top of the snow and not buried beneath all of it." he coughs, looking at his wife.
	
"You were sick for several weeks, feverish and yelling in sleep. I fed you as I would a baby, while you unconsciously suckled upon my breast. It was the only way. I apologize if this embarrasses you. You kept saying `Mother,' despite the fact that I am not. `Mother, no! Mother, NO! Please!' and `The Forest! The Forest!' were the only things which I could discern. The rest was unintelligible nonsense. Tell me, what did happen to your mother? I can tell from the way you look at me that I resemble her, no?" the question seems to stretch beyond eternity, surrounded by a widening gulf of mystery.

Bleach yawns, eager for escape. His host and hostess grant him with keeping his life secret, for at least one night. The two elves leave, climbing into the higher branches to their own beds. In his dreams, Grinlab reigns supreme over his nightmares, while a shadowy figure hovers on the edge of his consciousness. Who was that darkling? Who? 

VI

Bleach shades his eyes with his hand, gazing at the lone sun. By its orange glare and small size, he judges it to be Vast, the dwarven sun. So, today must be a Friday.

He rolls over to his side, careful of how high he is from the ground, and looks toward the peak of Devalcrag. A trail of smoke rises from its peak, where the city of Eden was. The eyes of great skull glow with their own heat within. A river of fire is vomited out of its mouth, leading straight down the center. Bleach cries out in surprise, nearly falling for the second time.       Timbre leaps down from above and lands on a thick branch with cat-like agility, not even losing him balance the slightest bit. "What, boy? What is the matter?" he asks.

"T-The M-M-M-Mountain! I-I-I-It's erupting!" stammers Bleach in his dismay. The elf looks disinterestedly at the smoky volcano, but is more concerned as the young boy seems to become whiter with fear. He shakes like an old man, his arms crossed over his chest, and his teeth chattering. "When?" croaks Bleach weakly.
	
"I'm sorry I did not tell you. Within a day after I found you, the Death Mountain (as it is called in your tongue) awoke. The fires of Hell leaped into the air and burned a hole into the heavens. I had guessed that the Dark Lord, deep within his catacombs beneath the Black Tide, had at last unleashed his wrath upon the Enlightened City high above. He sees other's prosperity as a mockery of his preferred desolate wastes. But, now that I know who you really are, I must say that you are the reason. I am sorry for your loss."
	
Bleach glares at the fiery mountain, staring straight into its unseeing, hating eyes. He stands rigid, consumed with the fires of his own hatred. "No," he says, talking to the elf but not looking away from that demonic spectacle. "I have not lost more than an old friend." He feels a familiar knotting in his belly, as if a colony of snakes slithered within him. No! Not now, not now! He pleads with his body, alarmed at having to do such a hideous thing at this time. He looks into the elf's face expectantly, as if choked with intense emotion.
	
Timbre kneels and takes him into his arms, mistaking his expression for a wish to be consoled rather than discomfort. "I..." he says against the nape of the elf's neck, unsure of how to phrase his plight.�I have to---UHHH... I've got to..." Timbre squeezes him harder, conveying great, yet misguided, empathy. "Can you... can you help he down to the ground?" he asks. Timbre takes him into his arms and leaps forward into thin air, plummeting to the forest floor like a stone. 
	
Bleach was lucky to keep whatever wanted out inside of him in, otherwise he would messed himself like a little baby. As it is, he had nothing to fear but fear itself. The elf landed feet first onto the floor, not splattering as Bleach had known he should of, but rather with hardly any jolt. He had fallen at least two hundred feet to the ground, not two! He sets Bleach down, who scurries into an overgrowth of bushes.

"Turn around," he says. Shrugging, Timbre obligingly does as he is asked. Bleach rips his pants down around his ankles and squats, disgusted by the smelly refuse he is depositing into the ground. How humiliating! He glances down himself and sees several ragged cuts in his feet. Blood flows, slowly seeping into the soil. Only now does he register the pain that he feels. Ouch! I'm in a thorn bush!

He leaps into the air, smarting from several places at once, and rushes out of the bush while hiking up his pants at the same time. Another branch of thorns had somehow hitch hiked into his shorts and sticks him in the tender flesh of his buttocks as well. OUCH! Timbre whirls around to see what is the matter. At the sight of the small child with thorns all over his body, on his clothing, and in his hair, the elf laughs. Bleach doesn't like this.

"What's the matter!?! Don't YOU have to do this once in a while!?!" snaps Bleach. "Don't tell me that you mighty elves are too high up in the aristocracy of society to do number two!?!" He speaks with wronged out rage, demanding an answer impudently of his elder. By age, the elf is eons older, but by manner, he's a selfish brat.
	
Slowly but surely, Timbre manages to quit laughing with only the greatest of efforts. "Sorry! It's just that..." HA! HA! HA! HA! "We don't! Any and all food we eat is burned off without the need for such trivial matters! I-I--" he breaks up into another round of laughter, clutching his stomach with both hands as if in great pain. "Never new it could smell so BAD!!" he finishes.   
	
Bleach finds no humor in this, so he merely ignores it. He begins to tell the elf what he had been planning on saying before his bowels had intruded into the conversation: "I was, Timbre of the Elves, banished a week after the Equinox.  A darkling had murdered a girl I had loved and befouled their precious bath house's water with her blood. My brother and I were blamed and barely escaped execution, thanks to my grand father, the Son of Dav." His eyes flicker at the elf and hold his gaze once more. "Did you ever hear tale of how the Dark Lord was foiled ten years ago?" Timbre withers once more.       
	
"Yes...  It is said, `the Great Alcrad was disarmed by the Dark Lord and betrayed by his squire, the Son of Dav.  He summoned all of his wits and happened to overpower the Dark Lord, sacrificing himself to destroy its Evil.'"

Bleach pounces, yelling the word "Liar!" at the top of his lungs. He crashes into the elf, forcing him to topple backward into another thorn bush with Bleach on top of him. Instead being torn to shreds, they fall onto solid dirt. Bleach looks to either side and sees that the branches of the thorn bush have split into a V, apparently sensing what was about to happen. Impossible! Plants don't think!

Timbre grabs both of Bleach's wrists and pins them against his back, embracing him. After a while, he lets go and Bleach embraces him back. "How," croaks Bleach against the elf's shoulder, choked with emotion. "How did you do that?" They kneel, face-to-face, embracing in the morning sun's rays, beneath the shade of a great tree. Bleach sobs, the elf croons.

"What, command the bush not to harm me? Tell me, boy, is the son of Alcrad ignorant of the ways of magic? Elves are in tune with their surroundings, the caretakers of the world we live in.  The mystery in the soft breeze of the wind which blows the leaves in the trees with an invisible hand; which carries with it the scent of the ocean, of life; the gentle exhale of the trees which we breathe in and exhale into the trees; the wind which carries our arrows to our villainous attackers and keeps our aim sure.  If we do not appease the wind by caring for the trees, the wind will not blow through our hair, nor will we breathe.  This rapport toward nature is the essence of magic." Once again, another is the teacher, Bleach his student. No matter dwarf, nor elf, nor man, or even Dav-Torve, all live their lives to experience and to pass down information to the young.
	
"The dwarves," he continues, "live in the ground and horde the precious metals found within its crust. They adorn themselves in armor made of what they have found below to wear in battles above. It is this pride in their possessions and the strength of their tempered weapons which leads them so easily to war: to brag of what damage they can withstand and unleash. Dwarves, by the consternation of their stomachs and eager greed for mass which they cannot make up for in height, are omnivorous, eating flesh and greens alike."

He shakes his head woefully, arriving at the evils of man, saving the best for last. "The men live in the fields, herding cattle for its furs and growing crops as they like. They uphold fire, the invention of dwarves, as true power. The all-consuming, ambiguous flames of destruction which they can summon with flint and stone to burn wood for their fires; to warm themselves; and cook the meat of the cattle they have slaughtered.

"They shake their heads at us because we do not eat of a fellow creature's flesh nor drink its blood. To them, we are as stupid and primitive as their cows which chew the grass beneath their feet!" he says, shaking his head slowly to convey great disgust. He raises his arms skyward to the lone sun, his feet planted firmly apart, letting the cool breeze caress his face and the sun to warm him fully.

No longer blinded by his fear or anger, Bleach sees his new companion for what he really is. Spouting a lecture to undermine the other races of the world, while simultaneously maintaining HIS people's humility; standing with his arms raised reverently to the skies; his coarse-haired chest exposed and heaving with his each and every breath---Bleach can see the specter of pride, glowing greenly from his entire body. This elf is not possessed with metal nor fire, but with himself. 
	
Grandfather had often told Bleach of a foolish titan known as Narcissus. Does this elf gaze lovingly into a stream for hours while he bathes, peering down into his reflection staring at him. Does he talk to the pool of water to hear himself speak? Is it a beautiful nymph he sees, or himself?

Bleach finds his voice again and stands, "Tell me, elf, can you fly like the birds? Does the wind bless your heavy form with their grace and bear your weight? Is that why you live in trees, to gather sticks and hay for your nests, so your women can lay their eggs in the warmth high above us land dwellers? Do you see the men as below you and the dwarves beneath the soil because they are so far beneath you? Tell me, have you ever kneeled when receiving a dwarven lord in your home? What is it that concerns you with the day I was born?"
	
Timbre crosses his arms again and glares defiantly down at Bleach, a pose so much like the one that Zandegoz often used that the poor boy had to laugh. "There is a saying among your people, boy, it goes `sticks and stones may break my bones, but words would never hurt me.'
	
"It is said that those born during the Equinox are destined to be at the mercy of both the Five and the Serpents: a priest may have evil in his heart which drives him to drink or gamble; the ork may have a portion of good in its heart which teaches them mercy. No matter who they bow to, they are still compelled toward the other. That is the balance of life. Those born on the first Equinox of the year are said to be bestowed with the might to unleash the ultimate good or evil, but are hindered by indecision.
	
"However, since there were two of you (your brother and yourself) born on the day of the Equinox, one became wholly evil while the other wholly good. You are the ultimate warrior, the one of legend. Is said that `one born of the light shall rise above the darkness of his life to kneel before God's Flower as her new warrior. And, if he proves himself to the Four, he may fly through the air on the wings of an angel, wielding the Light to overthrow Evil.' This, I believe is your destiny." 

Bleach begins his training as a warrior, with Timbre the elf as his teacher. Grandfather had taught him respect; Zandegoz loyalty and honor. "We elves are on a higher plain than both and both men and dwarves. While these two races live petty lives for the pursuit of their own interest, we live only preserve nature. Without plants, we would starve. Without trees to give shade and comfort, we would sweat. Both of these ailments are bellow us," he fires an arrow at a small target several yards away, and hits a bulls eye.

"To become an honorary elf, you must prove yourself to be able to become like one. You must have compassion, be proficient in archery, and become lithe and fleet footed. Elves can run like the wind and be as stealth as a mouse. You have told me how you like games, but this is no game, child. This is the entire world which rests on your shoulders."

Timbre ushers him within a few feet from the target and hands him set of darts. "Before we begin with the bow and arrow, you must first work on your aim. These darts are like arrows, but are easier to propel since you can just throw them at the target." At the elf's instruction, Bleach aims along the shaft of the dart and tosses it with a flick of his wrist, where it jabs into the wood of the post.

Timbre flogs him on his ear for his bad shot. "Good thing I didn't put that thing on a tree or else we'd unnecessarily harm the poor thing! Try again." Bleach stands with his feet apart, as the elf had stood, and tosses the dart over hand. It arrows down at a forty-five degree angle and lands in the ground a few feet ahead of him.  "Blast it, boy! Throw the dart straight! Don't tell me you were never taught to do such a simple task before!!" snapped Timbre, stamping his feet angrily.       

"I can throw," stresses Bleach.

"Prove it!" yells the elf at the top of his lungs in his agitation. Bleach stoops over and picks up a rock from the ground big enough to fit comfortably in the palm of his hand. He stands in a pitcher's stance with his feet apart and his left foot ahead of his right. He then lifts his left leg, aims, and lobs the rock right handed as his foot touches the floor. The stone strikes the middle of the target and breaks a small hole directly in the bull's eye.

The elf bellows with laughter, holding both hands to his stomach as if in pain. "So, I see you can, indeed, throw, but you were just using the wrong medium! Now, try it with one of these darts, but with a lot less body movement this time. Okay?"

Weeks later he finally graduated up to the bow and arrow lesson, resulting in similar sessions of put up or shut up. In this way, Bleach slowly learns how to become more proficient with a bow and arrow by taking in account which way the wind blew in relation to which way he fired. He moved on from a stationary target to a moving one and also learned how to maintain his equipment and make his own arrows by carving the bark off of straight twigs and making a sharp point on the end.

One day, he had asked Timbre why elves didn't make weapons from stone.  The elf had sighed deeply, indulging his curiosity, but not relishing it. "We are a simple folk, as I have always said. We do not wish to extinguish another's life, only to protect ourselves. People who crave war make weapons which will harm their enemies more and have them fear him because of what he has wrought. As it is, our way of fashioning our defenses is sufficient enough without improvement. If a creature invulnerable to wooden weapons attacked us, then we would use you precious metal!"

But, insisted Bleach, wouldn't a stone arrow head be easier to shoot than one without one? Again, his elven mentor was not to be up-staged by his pupil: "Yes, it would fly further and keep its course surer, even in a light breeze..." With this, Bleach agreed vehemently. "... However, it also would cause the arrow to penetrate deeper into the target, seriously harming it rather than acting as deterrent. And, the triangular blade on the arrowhead makes it difficult to remove the arrow without causing more damage on its way out. This is the work a true sadist, some one who's heart is evil." The subject dropped, leaving Bleach unfulfilled and feeling ignorant.

Still, he had yet to learn of magic...  

VIII

On the twenty fourth day of his training (he isn't sure what day it actually is, according to the Dwarven Calendar, since his hosts, being immortal, have no use for such trifles), Bleach decides to prove his expertise with his weapons. Sick of eating leaves and broth and bread, he vows to hunt his own kind of food---meat.

What good is a hunter who does not hunt? The citizens of the City had often hunted for sport on the outskirts of the veldt, killing rabbits and birds and the like. They had said he was too young to learn how to hunt because he might hurt himself. At least, that's what they always said... Now, he speculates that maybe, just maybe, they didn't trust him. Well, he had thought childishly, I'll show them! See if I don't.

He left the camp in the middle of a moonless night, walking soundlessly as he had been taught, not making even the slightest of sounds. He had taken only his bow and handful of arrows so he wouldn't be compelled to stay out for too long. Almost a mile from the Tree House, as he thought of his new home, he had hid behind a felled tree and waited.

Near two hours to dawn, he had spotted a white-tail deer, drinking from a nearby stream. The creature was beautiful and agile, standing ten feet away, on the opposite bank so it faced the tree he hid behind. Bleach knocked back his arrow and pulled the string taut. At that moment, a bird screeched, probably defending its nest.

Startled, the deer stopped drinking and abruptly raised its head, staring directly into Bleach's eyes. For a moment, it was dazzled by his odd gaze, but snapped out of it quickly.  The deer leapt over the stream, intending to run past Bleach, and that was when he fired.

The arrow caught the deer in the throat, plunging directly into its wind pipe and severing the jugular. It fell, gasping and bleeding profusely. Bleach cried out in joy and triumph, gloating over his victory over nature. However, this pride proved to be short lived.

The tree he had been hiding behind stood as if being miraculously replanted and an invisible hand shot out and slapped Bleach's white face so hard that his eyes teared and a hand print glowed redly from his cheek. The tree shimmered, lost all of its branches but two and a crack ran up the center of its trunk to waist level. The bark fell away and there, before Bleach, stood Timbre the elf. This was great magic, metamorphosis.

"Arrogant fool!" bellowed the titanic elf, towering over the small boy, taking full advantage of his height. "Murderer!" With each insinuation, he slaps Bleach once more. "Fool! Murderer! Infidel! Coward! Murderer! Fool! Fool! FOOL!!!" At the last, he strikes Bleach full in the face, sending him staggering back a few feet.

Bleach screams, his eyes welling with tears, and rolls into a protective ball fearing more punishment. "S-S-S-Sorry! S-Sorry, S-S-S-S-S-S-SIR!" he intones, choked up with emotion.

Rather than kicking him, Timbre merely stands above him, breathing hard to calm himself. He balls up one large hand into a fist and cocks his arm back, ready for a punch. Bleach shies away, but the elf merely uppercuts himself in the jaw. Timbre spits out his own blood, apparently he had also bit his own tongue. No longer consumed with anger, he kneels before the deer's corpse, and weeps.      

Bleach is surprised by this turn of events, having been afraid of the other's wrath and now feeling pity upon him. This kindly creature had hoped there never would be any need to dispense this sort of punishment, but had dutifully taken the necessary steps when an occasion did occur. For this reason, Bleach ended up loving him and hating himself.

Some what mournfully, Timbre took the shaft of the arrow with both hand and wrenched it out of the poor creature. He then broke the arrow on his knee and threw the two halves over either shoulder. He raised his hands to Sun high above, praying. A radiant green glow appeared between his upraised hands, giving off like the filament of a light bulb. Muttering and incantation, the elf lowered his hands and massaged the flesh surrounding the deer's wound, moving back and forth rhythmically. As Bleach watched, the wound slowly closed into itself and solidified as there had been no damage there to begin with. This was great magic.

The deer lifted its head and its eyes flicked warily at Bleach, then focused on the kneeling elf with a look of what appeared to be gratitude. It licked his hand and he petted it with the other. However, when Bleach approached, it stood up rather stiffly and dashed off. Disappointed, he stamped his foot and sulked.

Infidel! Coward! Murderer! Fool! Fool! FOOL!!!" At the last, he strikes Bleach full in the face, sending him staggering back a few feet.

Bleach screams, his eyes welling with tears, and rolls into a protective ball fearing more punishment. "S-S-S-Sorry! S-Sorry, S-S-S-S-S-S-SIR!" he intones, choked up with emotion.    
Timbre stood, holding his hands out in front of him, fingers hooked into painful claws like an arthritic old man's. Apparently, reviving the dead did have its toll on the healer. "Little Flower," he said, addressing his student with his honorary elven name. "It is not our way to kill another creature. It is our purpose to protect all that is alive, regardless of our own selfish misgivings. I am sorry that we did not provide you with the nourishment which you are used to live by, but we refuse to kill any creature. If you must indulge in this blood lust of yours, then do as you wish, but do not kill another creature while in this woods."       

But how can I eat meat without first killing it? Surely it would be cruel to torture an animal by cannibalizing it while it still breathes," protests Bleach. He has already made agreed to never kill again, but is unsure about the nature of this compromise. He can eat meat, only he can't kill something to get it.       

"You don't have to kill an animal yourself to eat from its flesh, you merely have to find an animal which is already dead. It may be against my beliefs to take a life, but isn't against nature's. If nothing ever died, then there wouldn't be enough room for the living to exist. The realization of our own mortality is the reason we are compelled to do good deeds as long as our term on Earth lasts. Without death, there would be no reason to help each other because we'd all be busy attending to our own needs."

And so, every time Bleach felt the desire to eat another animal, he would stalk into the woods and search out a suitable prey. Usually, this would be a deer or rabbit eating grass in a field or a raccoon. He would wait in the shadows until a predator approached, and, after it had killed the deer or whatever, he would fire an arrow into the air to ward it off so he scavenge the remains.       

This, of course, proved to be more tedious then actually killing the animal itself and eliminating the middle man, so to speak, but he had given his word not to take another's life who didn't threaten his own. He had supposed that if he had been dying of starvation, then a living animal would pose a threat to his existence by merely being alive, but he quickly discounted this. If there wasn't any meat to be eaten, then he could just eat something vegetarious to sustain himself.       

After awhile, even the thought of meat turned his stomach. In this way, he achieved the second rite of ascension---forsaking unjustly killing another.

"Only he who is in perfect harmony with his mind, body, and soul may wield magic, the gift of the enlightened. We do not fight in a war because it will earn us the praise of another or because we enjoy it; we fight because it is what's right. That, my pupil, is called Valor. You have learned how to defend yourself and not to be the aggressor, this is Valor. But these are not the only ways to uphold justice, because we must also right which has been made wrong. Do you understand?"       

"Yes, I guess so. It was wrong for me to unjustly murder another living creature, so, you brought that deer back to life? Right?" he asks apprehensively, sitting cross-legged on the forest floor before the pacing elf.       

"I healed that creature's wounds as best I could, but I was not the one who restored its life. Reincarnation is the ultimate whim of the Great. God's Flower is the Mother of All Living Creatures, while the Dark Lord is the reaper of Souls and Exploiter of Evil. By using some of my own life force to heal the damage which was done, therefore hindering my own existence, God's Flower accepted this as my penance and rewarded my actions by balking the Dark Lord's power." He continues pacing, staring at his feet. After a while, turns about to face Bleach head-on. "There are Five living entities of magic in this world, as there are Five suns in the Galfaste. Each is assigned a color and controls a certain aspect of nature. Do you know what each of the Five Galfaste represent?"           

Bleach scratches his head for a moment, looking back into his past for the answer. He sticks his tongue out of the corner of his mouth, concentrating hard, staring into space. Finally, he counts off each one on his fingers "One- Vast, the Dwarf King of the sky, he owns the underground and all of its riches within; Two-Hearth, the Lord of Flame, he taught the men how to wield the art of fire to cook their food and warm themselves; Three-Mage, the Elven Scholar, he is a sage, the chronicler of all which has been and the protector of nature; Four- Atlante, Kracken in human tongue, he is the Lord of the Seas, the giver of all life. I'm not sure, but isn't God's Flower the fifth?"       

"In deed, she is the Mother of the Living and essence of the Four. Without her, the others would of never banded together to create the World. Men, Dwarves, and Elves are all three entirely different races who may never entirely co- exist peacefully for very long. Without God's Flower acting as the mediator between the Four, they would eventually cancel each other out! With all the differences they have amongst each other, it is their desire for her which makes them all equal.       

"Now, each of the Five Colors is the essence of one of the Five. Vast is Violet, the Master of Warfare; Hearth is Red, the Master of Flame; Mage is Green, the Master of the Forests; Atlante is Blue, the Master of Water; and God's Flower is Yellow, the Master of Light. Do you understand?"       

"Yes," Bleach answers rapidly, only pausing long enough for the elf to finish asking. "But, what of the other Two? Orange and Indigo?"       

"Those are the result of two entities using their powers together. Orange is the combination Red and Yellow; Indigo is Blue and Violet. Now, the essence of all these colors combined is White. And the absence of them is Black. Your are the entity of White, the Master of the Prism, and you're brother was the Black, the Master of Darkness. Had he survived our encounter earlier, he would of surely opposed you in your battle with the Dark Lord. Now, I fell you have considerable means to defeat him at last. Only the pure of heart can defeat him, and you are the purest I have ever witnessed." He kneels before Bleach and takes the boy's shoulders in either hand. After a while, they embrace warmly, like a father and his son.       Father, reflects Bleach. Who was my father? Why did he fail where I will, hopefully, succeed? I wonder...       

"On with business..." says Timbre as he stands, unaware of what the child is thinking. "Before I teach you any magic, I must ask you if already know any so I wouldn't be boring you fruitlessly about what have already learned. Well---?"       

Bleach nods, thinking back to his lessons. He stands up and looks down at the grass beneath his feet, concentrating. He raises his hand, still looking at the ground, and traces a circle in the air. The dew pelts off of the grass like a sprinkler system, coalescing into a small cloud of water vapor. As more and more of the moisture leaves the grass, an entire a square foot patch of grass slowly turns brown and dies.       

"Incredible!" breathes Timbre, completely dumb founded. "You evaporated the water right out of the ground!!! If you had been fighting with the enemy---" he trails off.       

Bleach waves his hand the small cloud begins to rack onto the patch of dead grass at his feet. Within a few minuets, the grass is replenished a thousand times quicker than it would on its own the natural way. "The people of Eden were dependant solely upon the popularity of their bath house. People would come from all over the world to soak in its purifying waters. It was their only natural resource.       

"I was banished because the girl I loved had been murdered by an evil spirit, her blood tainted their precious water. Strange how someone with such a pure heart could defile their pure waters with the fluids which give her body life. Grandfather taught me how to master Water Magic." He takes one of the elf's bandaged hands in his own. It seems that the act of healing has cost a great sacrifice of his own, the use of his hands. Timbre's hand glows with a mysterious blue light. "Your body is constructed of mostly water: your blood, skin, urine, everything," Bleach explains. "I can manipulate each water molecule at will, healing your wounds and mine."       

Bleach does the same for his other hand and Timbre unwraps his hands. He stares at the fixatedly, as if he had never seen them before. "Healed. You healed me!" marvels Timbre, hardly believing what had just happened. "You are the chosen one, Little Flower! Now, I know who you really are; a savior!" He sits Indian style on the floor, his hands clasped together. "Do as I do, child." He closes his eyes and begins to mutter an incantation. Bleach follows his lead.       

A feeling of steady elevation disrupts the blank nothingness which he is in. He feels as if he is being lifted, but feels no hand upon his body and can still feel the ground beneath his butt. Nor is he standing since he has no intention to do this, and he feels his legs stay crossed as he had left them. In fact, he can feel his entire body go stiff and needled, too numb to move. He seems to rise a great height, then moves forward. He suddenly regains his vision, yet he hasn't actually opened his eyes.       

A vortex of what seems to be over a thousand colors spin before his closed eyes, like vultures circling over their dying prey, dizzying him to the point of nausea.  Blue, Indigo, Violet, Red, Orange, Yellow, and Green. He bolts forward into the final color, yet doesn't actually move. He feels a sensation of flight, flying forward at a great momentum. The world rushes past him at an incredible rate, he can feel his cheeks and face quiver like gelatin with the G- forces.  There's an incredible thunder clap of sound, an explosion so loud that he assumed that the entire world had blown into a billion pieces around him, as if it were a crystal ball smashed with a hammer.  KABOOOM!       

Even as the explosion subsides in the distance, slowly dissipating aftershocks in its wake, he hears the elf's voice, "Don't worry, Little Flower, that was only a sonic boom, you just broke the sound barrier!" He turns his head, and sees Timbre floating beside him. He sees his lips form the words and spit them out before his ears can pick them up. By the time he hears the word "barrier," the elf's lips are already forming the next: "Congratulations!" Before Bleach can speak, he plummets straight down as if falling from the very edge of the universe onto the world.       

He's in a tunnel, being pushed by invisible hands forward. The behind him there is absolute darkness, in front, a pin-point of light. They're forcing him toward the light! He feels anger, joy, and regret all at the same time in a strange hybrid of bizarre emotions. Anger for being rejected once more; joy for approaching the light, salvation from the bedeviled darkness; and regret at not knowing of his own crimes which could justify this bizarre banishment.       

He bursts through the tunnel's exit, and stares up along a woman's body from where he shouldn't be looking from. Her stomach is swollen and pregnant. At the same time, sees down along the woman's body at her child. From one perspective: joy, from the other, horror. A person yanks him out of the woman's body fully, cuts his umbilical with a swift slash of knife, and holds him upside down. The last thing he feels is a hard slap to his buttocks. He cries.       

He stoops over to sip some water from a stream, slaking his first after along run in the forest. Its cool, clean taste and the aromatic fragrance of the crushed leaves at his feet is soothing. He feels as if he can stand in this place for an eternity, with only water to sustain his thirst in the event of dehydration and feast on the grass along the banks of the stream in event of hunger. Just to feel this rare occasion of peace for the rest of his own life and the world's. Here, there is peace.       

Just then, a sudden, horrifying scream startles him from his respite and he looks up from the water directly into the eyes of hunter. It can't be! The tree people are our friends! What kind of grudge can they hold for us to be so determined in strife to return from the grave to carry out these deeds? The hunter, clothed in all white, with gaunt features and snow-white skin, aims his bow directly at him, the arrow held taut and ready.       He leaps over the stream, wanting to get a better look at this anomaly. Perhaps, at closer scrutiny, the vengeful spirit would prove to a mere illusion. That's when the hunter fires.       

The arrow rips out his throat, wounding him grievously. He falls to the ground, choking on his own blood and thrashing involuntarily with the extreme pain. Why, he tries to project the question to the hunter through his mind. Why did you do this?       

Bleach's mind leaps out of its daydreams and he returns to reality. He had just experienced the beginning of one's birth, and the death of another. Do Not Pass "Go" and Go Directly to Jail. He had leapt from the prologue of the book of life and skipped ahead to the final chapter without bothering the middle. Bleach looks down at the ground.  His mouth pops open and his eyes bulge with comic surprise---a double take. I'm in thin air.       

In deed, he hovers magically within a thousand feet of the ground. Beneath him, the canopy of Green Grove, home of the Dryads, is a seemingly patch of grass. To the north, the infamous Deval Crag is child's play thing. It can't be, I'm up in the air and not---       Falling! 

Even as he thinks the last word, he begins to plummet at a speed which seems over a thousand times worse than on the way up. He hadn't imagined the rising feeling, he'd been levitating! An eagle screeches above his head. Fighting against his fall, fearing the sight of the ground hitting him more than the actual impact, he tucks his legs beneath him and turtles around so that he's falling face up.      

A giant eagle with emerald eyes and great, powerful wings swoops down at him. He wills himself to fall faster, fearing what this creature would do once it gets clawed feet and beak on his tender flesh. Would it eat him as if he were a worm? The hawk catches him and begins to pump his wings as fast as it can, attempting to keep in the air against their combined weight.       

Bleach's fall gradually slows from a cannon ball's break-neck kamikaze death plunge to a feather's flittering descent.  Exhausted, the eagle sets him down carefully and perches in a low-hanging tree limb. The eagle squawks once more and then reverts back to its humanoid form---that of Timbre the elf.       

"Why is it, elven friend, that you can change form at will?" he asks, not in the least surprised by this sudden metamorphosis. Nearly a month ago, he would of fallen to the ground with a heart attack at this petty, prideful elf's parlor tricks. Is that a word, prideful? Full of pride...       

"As the guardian of these woods, do you think it beneficial to remain the same form for our entire eternal lives? The definition of elf, Little Flower, is `mischievous fairy.' We elves are not mischievous, but our deeds are merely mistaken for mischief by ignorant people," lectures Timbre. He snaps his fingers and becomes a smaller version of himself, large enough to stand on the palm of Bleach's hand, with little, insectile wings. "This is a fairy, which we are not." He snaps his fingers again and returns to his own, "normal" form. "We can be whatever we wish," he says, snapping his fingers again. This time, he becomes Bleach. "See?"       

The real Bleach nods at his fictitious replicate, barely grasping its meaning. The other Bleach which was Timbre claps his hands. The deer Bleach had shot before runs out of the forest and stands beneath the tree where Bleach Two is perched. The deer rears up on its hind hoofs and reverts into female form, clad in nothing more than her own skin---Lady Phillus. Bleach, the real Bleach, does another double take, instantly stricken dumb with guilt and amazement at the same time.      

"Don't worry, child," the elven woman comforts him. She doesn't even bothering to cover herself with her arms or hands, only stands there, nude. "You could not of known who I was. She had just regressed for a short moment into your old, barbaric customs. It is not your fault, only society's."       

"Now you see why I had been so wrathful at thy slaughter of a fellow animal?" asks Timbre, having changed back to himself. "Tell me, child, did you not find it awkward sleeping in a tree? For us, it is simple. We just change into birds and sleep in our humble nests!"      

	"Congratulations, you have mastered the art of Green Magic---Nature!" says Lady Phillus. She walks over to, unabashed, and hugs him patiently. Bleach respectively averts his eyes from her and body and concentrates on her face. She kisses his cheek affectionately. Timbre leaps from his tree branch, lands with his usual equilibrium, and gives Bleach a hardy hand shake.       

"Now, I must wish you farewell, Little Flower," says Timbre. He hands Bleach a map of the world, written on old tree bark, and a winged vest. "Here, takes these and your bow and arrows as a gift from us to you. The map will allow you to find your way anywhere in the world and the Enchanted Wings of Icarus will allow you to travel where you wish. Now, you must go to the Balkai Peninsula to speak with a tribe of men who live there. There you will learn the art of Fire. Good-bye to you, Bleach of the Aristocrats."       

Lady Phillus leads him up the tree, leaping from branch to branch and scrambling upward like a monkey. So great is her agility that she can land and leap off of each branch without disturbing the leaves the slightest bit.  Bleach, of course, is forced to use the rope ladder. He marvels at her grace.       

When he finally gets to the top, Bleach pokes his head through the canopy and looks around, like a gofer emerging from its hole to see if it can see its own shadow. He can see the peak of Death Mountain protrude from the due North with all of its phallic glory. Death's eyes peer at the world with hallow indifference, as if to say, "It's only a matter of time..." From its mouth, the molten lava is vomited out and runs down the middle of the world, forms the Venom River, and terminates into the Black Sea. To the far East Bleach can glimpse the Ruins of Fagrod and a large cave just beneath that. To the West, there is the Protected Sea and an archipelago. The world is exactly as it is seen upon the map Bleach holds.       

Lady Phillus indicates a large area of huts on a piece of land which protrudes from the world and is surrounded on three sides by water. "That is the Balkai Peninsula. You must go there before you can head eastward. Only these three settlements are truly safe to travel in. The Dark Lord has destroyed both Fagrod and Eden and the rest of the world is at his disposal. Do not step foot outside of the settlements of Elves, Men, or Dwarf, or you will be surely slain by one of His minions." Bleach dreads this and shivers. "Don't worry. Once you have become a full White Knight, a Paladin, you will be capable of disposing of any evil you see. But, as you currently are, you have no chance. Remember Valor at all times and never kill when you can avoid it."       

After a few pointers, Bleach straps on the wings of Icarus and dashes forward to get some wind resistance. At the edge of the branch, he leaps straight into the air, and flies.

The wind catches under his wings and Bleach flies higher. Below him, the world stretches out like an old, stained carpet. The trees form a minor area below him, a group of bushes rather than a forest of trees. The very soil of the ground is a blighted, infertile mud hole. Erosion has killed off any and all plant life, not even a single blade of grass can be spawned from this filth.       

Bleach looks above and sees the Five Suns of Galfaste shine down upon from directly above. The Mountain's shadow falls behind it and not onto the land, directly upward. Noon. He reflects back to his lessons in cartography and mutters the old anagram to himself, "Northern Elves (like) Sea Weed." N for north, E for east, S for south, W for west."      

Scanning the ground while circling above Green Grove, he sees the Peninsula and can just barely make out a set of houses. From this height, they look like only so many ant hills. As he spins clock-wise, the world seems to rotate beneath him as he appears to stay still. Peninsula, Black Sea, Fagrod, Death Mountain, Peninsula. Which way... should he go East? North? West? South? Or can he just go back to the forest and live with the elves for the rest of time?       

Once again, he looks upward. God's Flower smiles down upon her little cherub, offering him her embrace from behind the Four's fearsome protection. "Come to me," she beckons. "Go away," They command. "Come." "Go." "Come!" "Go!" "COME!" "GO!!!" Undecided, for wont of a coin to flip and see which fate would advise him to listen to, Bleach imagines a five- petalled flower in his mind's eye. I should go. One of the petals is plucked off by an invisible hand. I shouldn't. Should. Shouldn't. Should. As the fifth petal is plucked, he still can't find himself ascending.       

Icarus. Where had he heard that name before? Icarus and his father Daedulus had been imprisoned in Crete. Daedulus built wings for himself and Icarus. Icarus had foolishly flown too close to the sun and his wings had fallen off. No, I don't want that to happen, he thinks. He hears a cry and looks down once more, partly relieved by not having to see them any more. A black speck in the middle of the desolate wastes to the west can be seen.       

Bleach finally decides on following the elf's orders and head toward the peninsula. No telling what that thing down there really. From up here, it's an ant, but if he were on the ground, it may turn out to be some hideous monster ten times his size. The speck aims at him and opens fire. He can hear a loud Rat-Tat-tat from even up here, but has no idea what is happening.       

Projectiles fly past him at great speeds like angry bees overrunning their prey in their angst to sting. A hole is torn into the Wings and he begins to fall. The world rushes out at him, more than willing to crush him against itself. Timbre, help! 

Chapter Four:
Old and Young McDougles Have A Farm


I


Bleach crashes into a hay stack, which implodes on impact with a soft foosh! It catches in his hair, in his sleeves, and down the back of shirt as if he were a child attempting to imitate a scare crow. Bleach crawls deeper into the hay stack, despite the itchy feeling of having it so close to his skin. Why do horses eat this stuff? he wonders. He pokes his head out peers around at his surroundings.       

A farmer walks along two rows down from the Bleach hides, pitching hay with pitch fork into a wagon driven by an old mare. Flies as fat as golf balls fly around the mare's flanks and buzz its ears, and the mare snorts reproachfully and whips its tail about. The farmer himself wears denim overalls with a red and white plaid shirt, his cuffs rolled to his biceps to reveal his powerful, sun burned arms. His straw hat is pulled forward to keep the sun from getting in his eyes, but obscure his face above his nose. He sings in a twangy, Southern accent, "Old McDougle Had a Farm, E-I-E-I-O! On this Farm, he had some chicks, E-I-E-I-O!"       

The farmer pokes his fork into the hay, stoops, and lifts it in a high arc into the wagon behind him. He times these motions with the song: "With a chick-chick there, a chick-chick there, here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick, E-I-E-I-O!" He takes three steps ("On... This... Farm.") and begins on the next ("He had some pigs!"). The farmer moves on to ducks ("Quack!"), to dogs ("Woff!"), to cats ("MEE-OW!"), and finally cows ("MOO!"). Before he can begin another arduous chorus of this inane song, or impale Bleach with his fork (which is preferable to the former), the small boy leaps from hiding.      

"Enough! Thank you, but that is enough! I surrender!" pleads Bleach, shaking his clasped hands in front of his chest for emphasis. The farmer looks at him appraisingly, cocking his hat back so he can peer through his bifocals with his little, beady eyes properly. He stares for an indeterminable amount of time and then spits a wad of chew onto the ground thoughtfully.       

"Well, what do we have here? A young stranger hiding in my hay, eh? Speak, boy. Are you a runaway, taking a nap while there's chores to be done at home? Speak up!" he says, pronouncing the words "young" and "speak" "yun'" and "speek."       

Bleach smiles in the corner of mouth, not quite enough to attract the farmer's attention. "Well, sir, I'm not a runaway. I came from the home of the Elves to seek out a teacher. My name is Bleach," he holds out his hand to be shaken by the big, old man.       

"McDougle, Joe McDougle, boy! Pleased to meet cha! Don't be lying to old McDougle, boy, or I'll skin you like a ferret. Ever see a ferret skinned? Believe me, you don't.       

"No, sir, I never have, and, as you suggest, I guess that if a person should offer to show me how to skin a ferret I'd rather he didn't!" Joe stands over him, scratching the stubble of a beard on his face, then begins to guffaw wildly and slap his big hands on his knees. Bleach joins in and this is how they spend the next five minuets or so, laughing. "By the way, sir, may I ask what day of the year is this? I've been away with the elves for so long and they haven't got any calendars, y'know."       

"Yes, young 'un, I do, today's Saturday the 47th, 'cording to the D'ver-fish Calendar," Bleach's jaw drops almost to almost all the way to floor in his surprise. I've been with the elves for 35 days!! Joe just closes his mouth for him by putting one hand on the top of his head and pushing up on his chin. "Quit gawking!  You're liable to catch flies in yer mouth! ... Well, if you need some work, I guess you can stay at my place for a while and help out. The girls'd love ya, I'm sure of that much. Here's yer fork," Mr. McDougle hands Bleach the pitch fork and a mosseys away after nodding at the bale and then the wagon. Bleach gets the message and starts his chores.       

Later, Mr. McD sits in his thatched chair at the head of the table, smoking his pipe. The tall man sits back, leaning back slightly against the wall, his right leg crossed over his left knee. His flame red hair is now exposed without his straw hat on. Mrs. McD sits in her rocking chair, knitting. Their children, Ellie and Sophia, sit cross-legged on either side of Bleach, mirror images of each other. Both wear long, denim skirts with their red-and-white candy cane-striped stocking feet tucked beneath them; their teal blouses tucked in at the waist. Both have the same characteristic red hair as their parents, but Ellie has hair tied into pony-tails with red bows, Sophia's with green.       

For supper, the McDougles had eaten ham and eggs with corn on the cob. Bleach had said he didn't eat meat, so Joe merely nodded and told him to get a second helping of the corn and eggs; "Didn't raise and kill that damn piggy fer nuthin, Y'know!?!" he had whispered to Mrs. Mc D who sat at his left. Ellie and Sophie toss a tin can filled with dried kernels into the fire.  Bleach stares expectantly into the fire as Joe tosses another hunk of fire wood in and pokes around with a hot poker. Fire.       

Something in the can begins to pop and sputter and sizzle, as if some little critter had the misfortune to be trapped inside. Torment. Torture. Maybe it's a rat, burning alive with its hair caught on fire. Bleach imagines he hears a pitiful little squeak and shudders. Joe pulls on a pair of heavy gloves and plucks the can out with a pair of tongs. He pops the top with a knife and dumps some flurry, white things into Bleach's cupped hands. Magic Snow? "What is this?"       

Ellie and Sophie explode into unsuppressed giggles, holding their hands to their mouths in unison of each other. "Silly!" snaps Sophie, "That's Pop Corn!!" finishes Ellie. "You eat it!" they chime in chorus. Bleach shrugs and eats one to make sure. "You forgot ...", says Ellie. "... The butter!" finishes Sophie. Their timing is impeccable, thinks Bleach. Ellie always begins a sentence and sister finishes it for her so effortlessly that you could close your eyes and imagine only one person were talking. Amazing!       

Mrs. Mc D pours some melted butter from a little sauce pan on the kids' pop corn and then sits back down to resume her knitting. Joe fetches out a piece of wood and begins to whittle. Both hum "Old McDougle" under their breath.       

Bleach finishes his pop corn first and lays down with his hands on his belly. "Do," he says.      

Ellie picks up immediately and says "Re," nodding at her sister. "Me," says Sophie.       

"Fa," says Bleach.       

"So," says Ellie. "La," says Sophie.       

Bleach smiles, knowing that there are only two syllables left. "Te."       

Both girls shout "DO!" simulataneously that Bleach nearly has a heart attack. They're so in tune that they speak one at a time or at the same time, never alone.       

An hour later, the girls get dressed in their matching pajamas and climb into their bed, one on either side of Bleach, who wears only a pair of undershorts. Mrs. McD kisses their fore heads, wishes them "Sweet dreams," and closes the door behind her. The girls yawn simultaneously and each stretches, jabbing Bleach in the ribs on both sides. More giggles.  
    
II


It's been a long time, thinks Bleach. To think, in the beginning of this year, I was actually up there; living with the Chosen People at the very top of Devalcrag! And now, I'm sleeping in some farmer's house with his two tom boy daughters! As always, he awoke instantly at dawn, to watch the Suns rise and shine upon the world and banish all malignant shadows away like a radiant tide. Ellie and Sophie's room is like any other child's, the floor is covered with various clothes and miscellanious knick knacks all about. However, besides the mess, there is one not-so-common features. Three walls and the ceiling are all glass, and through out the room are various plants. Joe called it a green house. He said the girls like to grow things and why not, build one? They can learn how to be responsible, and stay outside, yet inside, all year long.

The green house is off the eastern wing of the McDougle's house, since you face south, with the horizon behind, as you enter the front door. The house is encompassed by a vast clearing with dark forest and hills about the edges.  From this vantage point, Bleach can watch the Suns rise from morning to noon. He lays on his back, his hands behind his head. Elsie is on his left, Sophie on his right, both sleep on their sides and face him.  A shadow is seen within 20 feet from him, against the Suns' light.     	

Bleach sits up and gasps in sudden fear. The shadow walks from he north-western corner and heads out and around so that it stands directly on the horizon. Bleach begins to settle down, noticing a peculiar triangle shape which stretches up from its ankles and peaks at its waist and the length of its hair.  It's only Mrs. McDougle!
�
Mrs. McDougle pulls metallic object from her pocket and strikes it with a little, wooden rod. "Time to get up!" she yells. The twins leap out of bed on either side of Bleach and run towards the door into the house and to their bathroom. He crawls wearily out and makes their bed for them.  He can hear grandpa's aged voice in his mind, scolding him for being with such wayward children. Well, he retorts in his thoughts, try and kick me now, old man. You're dead and I'm alive. A pestilence and blight upon your carcass.
�
The peak of Devalcrag emerges from north west as he crosses the room to the other side of the bed. It towers above the world, passing a great shadow on the ground which arrows through several miles of forests and grassland alike, across the blood red Venom River, and points directly to the McDougle's cabin like an accusing finger. Bleach gulps loudly, his eyes bulging out of their socket with mind-numbing fear and superstitious anxiety. Devalcrag, Spire of Death in the dwarven tongue. This is an omen! Some great misfortune will befall upon this household, whimpers Bleach under his breath. He feels his bladder almost erupt with a fresh draught of fresh urine from his fear.
�
Just then, the bathroom door swings open and the twins storm out, each clad in identical, fluffy cotton towels tied length wise around their waists and down to their knees. 

They appear as mirror images of each other, no distinction can possibly made between them. Both step aside at the time and wave toward the open door with their inside arms. Identical twins. How Bleach envied them.
�
He ran through the gap between them, thinking only of getting through that door and being able to pee in privacy. However, as he passes them, the both converge from behind him and yank on either side of the shorts he'd been wearing as underwear since that day he had met his dwarven comrade. He trips and falls face first onto the bathroom floor, his shorts forgotten in the grubby hands of the twin McDougle sisters. He couldn't help it. The pain in his throbbing testicles forced him to void himself where he lay.
�
Sophie and Elsie called him a "dirty boy" and slammed the door behind him. Bleach slowly got up and locked the door before they could do anything else to hurt him. The bathroom was a mess. They had overflowed the tub and splashed most of the water at each other, identical yellow rubber duckies floated in the sink, which hadn't been turned off and contributed to the mess. The first thing he did was turn the water off and pull the plug on that. Then, he walked haltingly, the gait of an old cripple, thanks to his injuries, and peered at the toilet.
�
A great quantity of refuse of toilet paper and an unmentionable mass still lay in there. Bleach could see the seat was down and only the sides were wet, as if the girls had sat back-to-back as they did number two. He no longer envied them. Geez! he thought as he flushed. They even crap at the same time!  He slaps his own forearm for having thought of such a word.  Yet, it was true. Not an original thought between the two.
�
He fished the soap out from behind the sink, careful not to hit his head, and climbed into the freezing water of the tub. He put his feet up on the rim and gradually sunk down lower as his body became more and more used to it. There he lay for almost an hour or more, with a watery-filled womb once again. He thought of his mother.
�
Later, he wrapped a towel around his waist and opened the door warily, expecting some more mischief. A small, rectangular closet/ corridor intersects between the twins' room and their bathroom, leaving the two of them enough room to hide on either side of the door and wait expectantly for him. He glances to the left, sees nothing but clothes on a rack and a door which leads outside. On the other side, there is an identical door which leads out to the back yard. Bleach takes the chance that no one is there and they aren't just hiding behind of the shield of the door for him to come out into the open. If they did that, he'd just run out the opposite door before they could move. He leaps through the gap, whirls, and slams their bedroom door behind him. Safe.
�
He stoops to pick up his duffle bag, and puts it down on the bed. He undoes the towel and lets it fall around his ankles. At the same instant, a harsh whistle explodes from the cryptic like silence. Oh, no! He'd forgotten about this being a green house! He looks across the bed and sees Elsie standing outside the glass wall, pointing and laughing at him. She wore an old dress and a thread bare shirt tucked in around her waist. He glanced behind him and saw Sophie standing in similar garb and posture. The bed fortunately obstructed Elsie's view of his lower body, but her sister had full view of his naked buttocks. The embarrassment finally ended when their mother's voice cried from outside that their breakfast "was getting cold."
�
They ran into the horizon, leaving Bleach to dress hurriedly while they were gone. Girls! he swore under his breath. Ironic how he should become so modest of his own flesh, since, in the beginning of this year, the thought of being seen naked by other people was a mere trifling to him faced every single day. In the city of Eden, atop Death Mountain, people were hardly ever seen wearing clothing.
�
The McDougles had their breakfast in small gazebo which was on the east side of their properity, providing an ideal view of the sun-rise (or is it Suns-rise? Perhaps sun-rises?). Bleach sat with his back to them, facing the twins who sat on the other side of the twins. To accomidate him, the spot directly in front of him was left empty, with Josie to his left and Elsie on the right. This way, there would be no argument between the two over who is attracting his attention the most. This was Mrs. Mc D's idea.
�
Joe sat at the head of the table with his wife at the foot.  Each of these two designations was clearly shown because there was a face drawn on the wooden surface of the table where Joe sat and a pair of feet where his wife was. To Bleach, it looked as if two-dimensional person was laying on the table and had some how misplaced his body below the chin and above his ankles.  He laughed. The twins laughed as well.
�
For breakfast, Mrs. Mc Donald (Bleach had still not heard anyone call her by name. Joe would refer to her as "the Missus," yell out "Wife" if she wasn't and in the immediate vacinity, and address her as "Dear" or so other compliment. Like-wise, the girls would caller "Mom" or "Mommy" or even say "Mother!" in tones of exasperation if she humiliated them) prepared a varitable feast of pancakes ("flap jacks"), sausages ("bangers"), bacon, eggs, orange juice, apple juice, honey for seasoning, buttered muffins, toast, and something peculiar called "cereal." Bleach ate plenty of each and everything, except for sausages and bacon, he even tried a bowl of cereal.
�
The were a couple tense scenes during the breakfast. The first time, Mr. Mc Donald had asked why he wouldn't eat meat. Bleach merely said it wasn't good for his digestion. At this, Joe grumbled something about, "Little Poof-ball, what do ya think we killed the damn thing for in the first place, decoration?" The other time, the girls said they had seen a "Full Moon" today and chuckled furvently amongst themselves. Mrs. Mc Donald cocked her eyebrows at this but said nothing.
�
The idea of eating elf flesh without even knowing it chilled him to the bone. Timbre had never told him how many animals were just animals and how many were elves in disguise, neither did Bleach attempt to ask. As far as he could tell, they all were elven people in metamorphosis.
�
After they ate, the McDougles started doing their morning chores, with the help of Bleach. The twins ran about, carrying an old whicker basket between them, which they filled to the top with flowers of all colors, shapes, and sizes. Mr.  Mc Donald split some logs, something which Bleach was horrified by. Joe had offered to show him how, but he flatly refused and insisted on doing something else. So, he climbed his way up a tree like a little, wan monkey and picked apples. These he tossed down to Mrs. McDougle who caught them in her apron and in turn emptied into a potato sack. They bounced off her apron, then rolled into the sack, both of which she held with both hands. Drop, bounce, into the sack.  Bleach began to hum and old song his mother had taught him as a child and crooned to him as a baby before that.
�
Joe picked up the tone and began singing: "Row, row, row your boat/ gently down the stream/ merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily/ life is but a dream. Row, row, your boat..." And so on. Bleach stopped in the middle of the second chorus, perturbed by what's happening. He had always thought his mother had made that delightful tone up just for him, yet it seems he was mistaken. He had loved her. The same way he had loved Amy. AMY! Why did he have to think of her, again! He had forgotten the events of that day, almost eons before, even though he knew it had been only a month or two ago. He had watched her die in front of him as he watched in amazement. Only after it was too late did he react. 

Poor, beautiful Amy. He wondered about all of the people he had met this year: the dwarf who had taught him how to become a warrior, Zandegoz the Hammer; his elven friend and mentor, Timbre, who had always called him "Little Flower"; and Timbre's wife... what was her name? Philiss? Yes, Philiss. He had also loved that woman, too. He kept meeting people and then, leaving them.
�
Joe McDougle sang "Row, row your boat" and the others soon caught on and they all sang, their entire lives were but dreams to them.
�
It was early that night, just before it too dark to go out, that Joe tapped Bleach on the shoulder. He had just dressed in his pajamas and was about to climb into bed with the twins when Joe walked quietly in the door. He was still dressed in his work clothes and parka to protect himself from the cold. "Put your shoes on, lad," he whispered, "And a coat, too." 

He tip-toed out, leaving the door open. As an after-thought, he half-turned to look a Bleach again and raised a finger to his lips: Shhh! Bleach did as he was asked and slipped on his coat with out bothering to change. He closed the door as silently as he could. He looked left and saw a horse, already hitched to a wagon, eating from a bag of oats. Straight ahead, Joe was searching in the linen closet for something. Again, he'd left the door open. He pulled out a strange, cone-shaped hat and a white sheet. He walked toward Bleach, closed the door to the house carefully behind him, and shooshed Bleach again. Whatever he was planning on doing, he was determined to be stealth as possible. He certainly didn't want the girls to know about it.
�
Joe followed Bleach out the other door and closed it behind him. Joe put on the hood and draped the sheet about is shoulders length-wise and cloaked it about himself so his clothes underneath could not be seen, only the white sheet. He climbed up into the wagon's seat, holding the corners up with both hands in the manner of a woman wearing a skirt, so he wouldn't trip, and Bleach climbed in along side him. To Bleach, Joe looked like the ghost of naughty child, white-sheeted and wearing a dunce cap. At a time like this, he chose not laugh. The truth is, the farmer scared him. Joe had cut a pair of eyeholes into the hood so he could see where he was going, even with it pulled over his face. Through these holes, Joe's eyes looked malicious.
�
The horse, Night Rider, so called because it was entirely black, was not at surprised in the least about the way the farmer acted. Bleach had expected it spook upon seeing it master climb into the wagon behind it in ghost apparel, sprinting down the countryside with the two of them haplessly flailing about for the reins. However, it just looked into Joe's eyes and he looked back; in bizarre conspirational way, between a man and his horse. To Bleach, the horse seemed to nod dolefully and then turned straight ahead. Joe flicked the reins slightly and Night Rider trotted silently into the horizon. He seemed to know the way, thought Bleach in alarm, as if they'd done this a thousand times before.
�
About a mile down the dirt road, Joe called out, "HEE-YA!", and the horse the instantly broke into a full run. Some chickens which had paused to peck at the dirt flew off in a frenzied rush as the horse came colliding towards them. They met some others wearing sheets like the one Joe wore, as well. They all stood in a clearing, at a cross-roads. 

Joe ties his his horse up with the other's along a wooden fence of to one side. Night Rider resumes chomping away on his dinner.
�
One man takes his hood off, and his shaven head glistened oddly in the setting Sun's light. He nods, and every one else, including Joe, take theirs off, too. Judging by his demeanor and the other's subservience to him, Bleach supposes he's their leader.
�
The Master of Ceremonies looked disdainfully at Bleach. He pointed him out as his fellow bretheren lit torches so they could see in the darkness. The light gave a peculiar quality to their faces --- cadaverous eyes, leering, sneering faces, hollowed-out cheek bones. They all looked... well, scary. "Who is this interloper?" asked the M.C. "Who has brought this outsider into our midst during these ceremonies? Who?"
�
Joe put a hand on Bleach's shoulder and squeezed reassuringly. Belatedly, Bleach realized that Joe was the only one who had any hair in this odd gathering of locals. "I brought him, Wallace. He is a visitor in my house. I trust him as I would my own wife. Yours, I'm not so sure of." The others laughed at this odd little joke, and Wallace silenced them all with an angry glare. Joe continued, "Besides, my little daughters seem to take kindly toward him. He may even be a son in law in just a few years, I think."
�
Again, they laughed, even Wallace. "Make sure he ain't on the business side of a shotgun, Joey!" called one of their comrades. This, Joe didn't find at all amusing. Wallace clapped his hands briskly and the other men abruptly went silent. "And now, for the pies de resistance. Getlemen, this ceremony is to remind you all of the evils of the outside world. I see that Joe, here, has forgotten his lessons." The hand on Bleach's shoulder trembled.
�
"Tonight, we burn this marker so that all outsiders everywhere will get lost. Any one who must rely on these signs for their bearings are not of your number and must be dealt with accordingly. If anyone asks you for directions, to any place, for any reason, must be steered clear of your homes. Tell them only how to get out of town and say that is they must go to get where they are going. These have no purpose to us and must be burned!" With that, Wallace took his torch to sign post which had four arrows, each pointing toward a different place. Bleach could only read one word, CIRCUS, which pointed to the east, before it was engulfed in flames. The others followed suit. The rest of the night, they rode to different sign posts, alone and in groups as large as three people, and burned them as well. A word came to Bleach from the back of his head, one Grampah had taught him: Xenophobia- the fear of outsiders.

That night, the owl hoots... shadows walk the earth.

Bleach climbs out of the twins' just as the Suns come up over the horizon. It was a warm night, so they had slept on top of the covers last night. He was able to crawl along between the twin sisters, who slept with their backs to him and on either side of the bed, nearly falling off. He walked as stealth as a mouse, his feet barely touching the wooden floor with each step, as he slowly made his way to the door. A couple feet from the door, within arm's reach of it, a floorboard suddenly creaked with his weight. He froze in his tracks, awaiting the humiliation.

Nothing. He waited. Nothing. "Nothing was stirring, not even a mouse," as the old song had said. He tip-toed the last few steps to the door and opened it noiselessly. He locked the door from the inside, just enough of a precaution so that he could detain the girls momentarily while he got into the bathroom and locked that behind himself. They would never of expected it to be locked on them when they just unlock it as simply as a flick of a switch. He sighed, facing toward their door, anticipating the girls to charge at it, thinking they had fooled him again by feigning sleep, only to bounce right off of the door. He felt somebody tap on his shoulder.
�
His heart leapt right into his throat and he swallowed as hard as he could to force it back where it belonged. He was absolutely certain that both of them were sound asleep in the other room. He turned around, slowly, fatigue suddenly wiping him out, his pale face grave and cadaverous; old. He looked as if he had aged a thousand years in just a few seconds. Mrs. Mc Donald stood behind him, holding a candle on a brass candle stick, a big smile on her face which stretches from ear to ear. She holds a finger to her lips, commanding him to remain silent, and whispers, "Don't worry child, you can take your bath now. Those girls are so rambunctious, aren't they? I'll wait until you're finished before waking them up, okay?" Her voice is pitched so low, Bleach can barely even hear it, even though he's standing directly in front of her. He smiles, nods, and walks to across the hall into the bathroom. She had already filled the tub for him while he had slept and now sat on chair her legs crossed and her hands folded around the candle on her knees. He thanks her, without making a noise, by blowing a kiss. 

Afterwards, he dresses in a nice, clean set of clothes she had laid out for him on the toilet tank and finds her where she had been the last time he had seen her. "Thank you," he says aloud, no longer afraid of what the girls may to do to him now that he's dressed and fully awake. He walks out the door which leads to the front yard even she steps out the opposite one. He's decided to walk today, get some fresh air. He waves to her, good-bye, and she returns the favor, closing the door behind her. Fifty paces from the house (he had counted them to occupy his mind with some activity in order to cleanse it of impure thoughts), he hears the soft tinkling of the metal rod against the triangle---the girls'  wake-up call.
�
Through the glass walls of the green house/ twins' bedroom, he sees them leap from beneath the covers and run full-tilt from either side of the bed and across the room. Elly reaches the door first and yanks it open and then Sophie slams it shut behind. They each grab the doorknob in both hands, plant their feet on the wall, and arch their backs, effectively using their combined weight in an attempt to keep him inside. Bleach sees the entire display through the open door which had used to exit the house only a moment ago. Sophie giggles once, but her sister admonishes her in a whisper. "Quiet, stupid! Don't blow it!! He'll be waking up any minute and this is supposed to be a surprise!" Sophie apologized in the same conspiratal tone.
�
He tip-toes closer, then leans against the door frame with his arms crossed confiently across his waist and watches. Sophie complains, using her normal speaking voice this time, but Ellie continues to whisper. "Shhh!! Shut up!"

Bleach whistles and the girls' heads swivel to gape at him in surprise. He touches his nose with his right hand and waggles his fingers. Before they can move, he lunges out the door and slams it behind him. He hears a mighty thud as the girls fall to the floor from eiether exhaustion or pure shock. He sprints halfway across the yard before stopping. He puts his hands on his knees a peaks at them from between his legs.
�
A pair of heads peer at him from the door of an upside-down house. They're not going to chase him this time, just watch him suspicously. He yanks the back of his shorts down and moons them both. The upside-down girls in the upside-down house slam the door behind them. The upside-down Ellie seemed to fume with intense anger while her upside-down sister cried. He laughed as he straightened his shorts out and walked confidently into the woods.

ME AND MY SHADOW
�
He steps foot within and a constricting presence, a tremety as precarious as the gaping maw of an old well with indeterminable depth, a pit leading straight to hell and misery, engulfs him completely. Jonah. Who? The guy. The one who was swallowed by the whale. Captain Ahab? Pinnochio? Was the whale named Moby Dick or Monstro? Neither! Jonah was a prophet, wasn't he? Yeah! Yeah, you're right. I can't believe I forgot that. Oops! (An internal conversation.) 
�
He looks above and sees that the canopy a trees completely blots out the sun light, making it seem as if it were night even though it wasn't. Dark. That's the word for it. Deep within him, something shivers, at the core of his being, maybe even his very soul. However, instead of fear, he feels a strange wonder. He'd never been out before in the dark. He always slept at that time. I wonder, what is it like to prowl in the abscence of light, darkness, with the hyprocritical light of the Suns to guide my way? He'd also never seen the moon, maybe never will. He's heard of a Man on
the Moon, but never has seen him himself before.
�
Darkness in the Providence of Light, he, a creature of Light in it's purest form, advances further into the mystery. 
�
A pair of eyes, seemingly hovering in the darkness, stare down at him. He stares back. Hoo! the apparitian says. 
�
Deep in the shadows, a lurking presence. Its two lantern-bright eyes peer at him with odd luminescence. Not bright or radiant. Nothing so beautiful. Sud-dued, not entirely dark, eiether. Not like inside his brother's coffin.
�
As a young child. two or three years old perhaps, he would creep silently to the stairs to the basement, peeking over his shoulder for with every step. Granpa, or course, wasn't there when he made these forbidden acts of stealth. His mother wasn't home since, being the Goddess of Fetility and all, it was her responcibilty most of each year to make sure the farmers reaped a greater harvest since the last, season after season, until they were content with their own labor as well as her's. Then, having it opened with the utmost care he could muster, he would climb down the sixteen stairs into the dim room.
�
How did he know there were sixteen and not one more or less? Because, he had numbered them all himself in his own special way. His chosen method was to mark each with sixteen of his favorie colors in all the world. The top stair was marked plaid, which he absolutley hated, and the last was his favorite of all, white and totally unmarked. He was a fickle boy. The top and bottom steps were the only constants, the others were always assigned a different color each week or even each day. To make sure that the last step was never blemished, he would hop from the second-to-last step to the floor over the white step so his feet wouldn't touch it. The floor was carpeted in a beautiful green which reminded him of
grass and trees, which also reminded him, in turn, of his own mother.
�
Down in the dim room, the only light source was the sunlight which shined through the open door. There was nothing down here, just that mysterious box which his brother slept in during the day.
�
He would open the coffin lid and put his brother's arms around himself and close the lid. He lay this way for a long time hugging his brother and pretend he was being hugged back. After a while, Granpa would invariably come home and slam the basement door, then shuffle about while he cried, "Bleach! How many times have I told you not to leave this door open?!?" He would sneak out of the coffin, up the stone
stairs and wait and listen to Grandpa's search for him through the door.---
�
The illusion is shattered by another horrible utterance of the question at hand, "Hoo?" There he had been standing for a length of time he couldn't even imagine, daydreaming about his past even as he was scared completely out of his wits. Wishful thinking. He just wishes he was back home, in the arms of the brother in black he'd never really known.
�
"Hoo!" A third time. Now, the word was spoken as an exclamation, as if impatient for a responce to the same stupid question. Hoo are you?, he imagined the creature in shadow to say. Hoo are you!?! What's the matter?! Don't you know hoo you are!?! He stared up into the glowing eyes which seemed to stare at him accussingly.
�
This time, he spoke directly to the possesor of those accusing eyes and his voice was not tainted fear. "Do you want to know who I am? Well, come down here and ask me yourself... if you're not too afraid, that is!" The creature spread its wings the flew off, saying one last hoo! as it left. He sighed. Only an owl.
�
A voice from behind him spoke, strangely familiar yet incredibly more alien than anything he'd ever heard before. "So, you want to know who you are, do you, Bright Boy? Well, I'll tell you---" Bleach spun around and as he did a hand shot out from the darkness, grabbed him by the throat, and another hit him in the stomach and knocked the wind out of him. He fell with a painful thud to the floor with this demonic creature bearing down on him. He stared into its face, all of ghastly sharp teeth and luminescent eyes, and he tried punch at it with his right fist. The beast grabbed his right wrist in its left hand pinned it down beside his head.
�
He tried to hit it with his left, but the thing somehow ducked its head inside of the arc and bit his left thumb, hard. By then, all of the thought of fighting back had gone out of him. "You are," the creature, the darkling he finally realized, continued as if it hadn't skipped a beat, "Another juicy morsel I shall gobble up, just like that girlfriend of yours!" The creature straddled him with its knees on the ground on eiether side of him and leaned forward with its mouth open, getting ready to tear out his throat. It drooled obscenely, saliva spattering him like colorless blood, while those fangs glinted and came closer and closer and closer.
�
As the creature's head came forward, he mustered all of his last strength to bring his own up and crack it in the face with a clean, economic stroke. The darklng let go of him and covered its face with both hands. "You broke my nose!" it complained just before he brought his right knee up into its crotch. It faltered for a moment, then he swung at with a roundhouse right which took it full in the chin, knocking it to the floor beside him.
�
He rolled backward even as he healed himself magically with a spell he long ago had forgotten; he last time he had been so grievously injured. He then hopped on his feet and crouched low in a dwarf's fighting stance.
�
Instead of confronting him, the darkling merely stood and backed off a couple feet further into the shadows. It held its hands in front of its face to consider the blood which now covered both palms and dried to its skin. A long, reptilian tongue snaked out its mouth the double set of fangs and licked the blood off of both hands with the quick laps a dog would use to drink from a bowl of water. Then, it curved up to wipe the remaining blood off of its face with a clock-wise motion. Before it was finished, the tongue darted towards Bleach and hissed, splattering two fine droplets on his shirt and finally retreated back into the hateful maw of the beast. "Funny," mused the darkling, "Even my own blood tastes so delicious to me. I had thought myself a connoisseur of such things. But, oh, her blood was so sweet! Like rose's blood."
�
Bleach had felt a deep revulsion in the pit of his stomach upon seeing this creature drink its own blood, maybe even a small twinge of fear, but loathsome rage sparked itself inside of him. His feelings for poor, innocent Amy had dried up inside like a bundle of dead sticks. However, this slur on top of all that had happened acted acted as an emotional piece of flint which burned that particular fayg�t into a blaze which warmed his heart with something like love. However, that love for her was juxtaposed by his extreme hatred for his adversary. The stronger his love grew, the more he hated this vile thing. This wretch. This interloper of his thoughts which had framed for the charge of murder. 
�
He freaked out. Bleach cursed this thing unintellibly in all of the tongues he knew of (human, dwarven, even in ways no one would ever thought possible) and began to hurl stones at which he picked off of the ground and tossed at it.
�
The first and second volleys, two or three rocks each, passed completely through the darkling as if it wasn't even there. It laughed a hideous laugh as it began to hover about two feet of the floor. Frustrated, Bleach grabbed one rock at at time and immediately hurled it before reaching for another. Still no contact. The darkling rose higher into the air, four feet, then six, seven, eight, nine feet. At ten feet, it made an obscene gesture then disappeared in an explosion of scorching fire. Bleach stood, rocking back and forth on his heels, with his hands on his knees. Suddenly, he felt very, very old.
�
A fist as large as a ham struck him hard in the right ear and he toppled over onto his side. His ear stung and he heard a buzzing, whooshing sound from the intense p ain. An enraged Joe stood over him, his face contorted hideously with simple-minded anger, his arms held rigid at his sides and bent at the elbows, with his large hands fisted and shaking in front of him, as if he were a weight lifter frozen in mid-curl. His hazel eyes conveyed the most emotion because they seemed ablaze with an inner fire of their own. His hair was disheveled, a tangled mess of red hair which looked almost like a crackling camp fire as the wind blew through it. Joe slowly rais ed his hands to the top of his head and rubbed them through his hair again, as if in attempt to massage his brain.

Bleach looked from him to the girls.  He could not tell who was who because the both only wore gray towels, their hair wet so that it clung to their skulls, they embraced their mother, who kneeled on the ground so that each girl could put their head over a different shoulder, who hugged them both back. She stared at him as her daughters wept. Bleach could see a tantalizing amount of flesh along one of the girls' legs, clear up from the foot to the thigh with a peek of a right buttock.  Joe caught him looking, so he struck him at the nape of the neck with a chopping right-handed blow which sent him sprawling onto his stomach and his face became covered in mud. As he pushed up off of the floor he looked forward and took in a horrible sight.  He almost gasped, but Joe stomped him in the small of the back and he lost his breath.

The glass wall of the green house, the girls' bedroom, was shattered.  Broken pieces of glass lay every where, on the floor inside the room, on the grass outside, even hanging from the frame in jagged edges. A dozen or so rocks littered the room, some had even scuffed the inner wall. Th e plants had been all been dumped over and the soil was spilling out of them. A few picture frames had also been knocked down, one portrait of an old, bald man holding a pitch fork and woman in a humble dress and a homely face, presumably the twins' grandparents, had been ruined by a large, gaping hole in the center. This was a malicious act.  It suddenly came clear to him. He was being accused of something he had not done, again, and paid the price. In a bizare form of juxtaposition, the d arkling had hypnotised him so that, while it seemed he had gone for a walk in the woods, he had actually walked around to this side of the house and perpetrated this horrible thing unknowingly. How long had Joe stood there, rubbing his hair in apprehension, while the girls stood crying their mother's arms, husband and wife staring on in disbelief?    

Joe kicked him in the belly so hard that he rolled over onto his back. The angry farmer/husband/father stomped Bleach once more, this time in the stomach. As Bleach rolled over onto his stomach, Joe stomped him on his buttocks so hard that he could feel his crotch aching as his body was squished into the floor. 

When he pushed up again, Joe field-goal kicked him in the ribs so hard that he flew a couple feet through the air and landed in a pile of manure.

Joe cursed under his breath. He undid his belt and looped it around his fist incase Bleach tried any monkey business while he was being disciplined. This is one thing he great deal experience with, discipling a wayward child. With rambunctous pair like Sophie and Elsie for daughters, he would have a great wealth of knowledge when it comes to this subject. Spare the rod and spoil the child. "If I had a dollar for every time I had to do this," he would tell one of his daughters as he took his "special" paddle to her (he had crafted it himself --- from an old pin-pong paddle.  The paddle had two sides: a smooth side where he would hit one of the girls on the heiney with a few quick flips of his wrist, and a sharp side through which he had driven five sharp nails in case he had to get really rough), "I would be a millionaire!"

One time, Josie had the gall to ask him, "who would give you the money?" after he'd spanked her. He took it as an insult and gave her ten smacks with the sh arp end of the paddle. The result of which, she didn't sit down for nearly a month, well, at least not voluntarily. He had to insist that she sat down while they said grace. Afterwards, she was eating her food standing up at her end of the table. Joe never liked having to perform this task, but he did kind-of enjoy doing it. Each year the sight of one of the girl's cute little tushy would entice him more and more. After dispensing discipline upon the girls, he and the Missus would go to their room to "bump uglies" for a while, as his father called it. Joe's father had beaten him as a child, as was his right and obligation. Only then, he had used whips and chains and a heavy brick which he'd use to break Joe's fingers with. One time, he'd ev en got so angry that he'd thrown Joe off of the roof of their house and broke both his legs and his fractured some ribs. Joe's father told his mother he'd had accident while climbing a damn tree. But, Joe loved his daughters to an extent that he was never so drastic.

But, this time, it was different. This ingrateful brat destroyed his property and every man knows if you destroy another man's property you're saying he's not a man. And that's the greatest insult you can use to soil a man's reputation with. It was even worse than sleeping with his wife, but not by much. Joe took his belt to the little son of a bitch and he intended to kill him.  The belt struck Bleach across his shoulders, from the right to left, and smacked across his ribs.  Joe yanked it back and hit him in the right ear. The third lash was across his kidneys. Joe then struck him an additional ten times in rapid succession, one after the other, on different parts of his back. When he was finished, this skin wa s split in several places and was raw and red. The final and most decisive strike was an underhanded blow to his adam's apple which wrapped around his neck twice. Fatigued, but still angry, Joe picked him up by the throat with one hand and with the other one grabbed him by the crotch. Joe tossed Bleach through a white picket fence he hadn't seen before. And, judging  by the paint which came off on his clothes as he hit it, it was just installed. So much for home decorating. 

"Get the hell off my property," said Joe, with little conviction, as he led his wife into the house. They each carried one of the girls, who had cried themselves to sleep, which they cradled in both arms like small babies. The last thing Bleach heard was the side door or slam shut.  Then, he picked himself up and left.


ON THE ROAD

Bleach stood at the side of long, paved road which winded its way from the west to the far eastern horizon. He held his hand out with his thump up and waved it while he looked expectantly to either side. He was hitching a ride, something Grampah warned him against never, ever, doing. When Bleach asked him what it was, Grampah showed him how. 

Sometimes, adults were funny that way. That you were always told not to do something, but they did it anyway. Grampah could of hitched a ride lots of times, but he never did. So far, Grampah needn't worry; nobody was coming, anyway. 

Funny how somebody built this road and they never used it. I wonder why? How could this road possibly be here and not be used?
Could they perhaps not know it was here? That would be impossible!

As he thought these things, he walked. The ground beneath his feet is hard and firm, radiating a mysterious heat through the thin soles of his shoes. He liked the feel of it, a complete contrast to the soft, wet grass and filthy mud which drastically changed with each foot step. The road is resolute. It goes straight ahead and around a corner, exactly where he's headed. He knows not who put it here and for what purpose is completely inconceivable to him. He stared at his feet, marveling at how they moved. One foot lifted itself from the ground, moved forward, lowered itself to the ground, and the other advanced ahead of its brother. Right foot forward, left, right, left, right... He envied them, they knew how to walk. He knew nothing, but they knew how to walk. He looked ahead of himself to see where his smart feet were taking him. He stopped. 

After waiting a full hour, he sits down in frustration and slowly falls asleep. He lies there, undisturbed, in a dreamless slumber. He begins to snore.

Much later, he begins to have nightmares. He dreams that Grinlab climbs out of the gaping mouth of the volcanic mountain, Devalcrag, and stares down at him menacingly. The little creature which had shot at him while he sleeps now dances about his feet, about the size of an insect, and stabs him continually in the ankle with a sword the size of sewing needle. He stomps it with his bare foot and the giant does the same to him.

He wakes with a start and hears the same chugging, whistling, popping sound he had heard the day his mother died coming from the west. He looks that way and sees a cloud of dust and glint of steel, coming closer every second. He jumps behind a boulder and hides.

He peeked out from behind the rock and saw an eccentric looking old man in peculiar clothes pull up in a bizarre, metallic vehicle. He slowed down to a crawl and called out in a voice has somehow gaspy, friendly, and, some how, as Grampah used to put it, with A-MAN-OF-THE-WORLD's tone ("I've been all over the world, and, boy, the tales I can tell...") all wrapped into one, "Hey, you there! Hop in the wagon and you climb in front with if you want a ride! I can't spot this damned thing on a dime, y'know!!!" 
Well, almost.

Bleach did as he was told. At least, the man did gasp. And with good reason: a miniature chimney was attached to the front of his contraption and it gave off grayish-black smoke which blew directly in his face. He decided to trust the guy. Surely, somebody as peculiar as this couldn't be of any harm to associate with. Could he? He shouldered his backpack by both straps and jogged alongside of the wagon and leapt in. He landed heavily on a large pile of coal which filled the wagon halfway. This must be the power source, he thought. The wagon was hitched to the back of the odd machine by a short length of chain. Bleach hopped over that gap lightly and landed on the seat right next to the old man.

"Graceful, ain't 'cha?" the old man asked almost casually. He wore a leather aviator's cap with his white hair protruding out the front over his fore head like a small fan. Because of the exhaust, his hair was almost black at the tips and his bushy side burns were white. His face was creased in many places and he had crow's feet around his eyes, which made him look very old, but the eyes themselves were bluer and more lucid than those of any one any fraction of his age could possibly be. Worldly. Like Grampah, we wore horn-rimmed glasses with wire frames, which occasionally got all sooty so he had to clean them with a dirty handkerchief while he drove with his elbows---which he was doing at the moment. 

He wore a red-and-white, candy cane-striped scarf which he wrapped around his neck twice and flapped in the breeze. Besides these things, his dress was not too different than that of the common blacksmith, complete with brown apron with the pockets filled with tools. He wore a leather belt which was buckled over top of the apron he had a pair of utilitarian boots which have appeared to have been torn and repaired and then torn again a great deal times, considering the various stitches on them.

The man held out a gloved hand, his left, and shook Bleach's from across his body. "My name's Athens Ford. And this, my friend is My Marvelous Machine. I invented it. I'm going to display it at the circus. What do you think, my lad? Isn't just a simply wonderful machine?" Athens smiled with teeth whiter and straighter than Bleach would expected in the mouth of such and old man. A little spark of light glinted off of one tooth, creating a peculiar sense of goodwill, actually making the smile seem even more benevolent than it otherwise would of been. Then, Athens upper row of teeth popped out of his mouth and fell in his lap. Bleach blinked. Where there had been healthy teeth a second ago, there was only pink gums in Athen's open mouth. "Oops!" said the toothless old man. He plucked his teeth out of his lap, blew on the them to get the crud off which might of accumulated on them, and put them back in his mouth. "Sorry. It's these dang dentures of mine! They keep falling out!"

Bleach was astonished. At first, he had been absolutely terrified by the sound of the oncoming machine. He had thought that the malevolent machine which had killed his mother and all of the trees in the Forest of Tears so many years ago had finally returned to finish the job by killing him, too. Then, he saw this strange little man roll by in this thing which he calls his "Marvelous Machine" and he could only wonder what else could possibly happen to him. The machine at first resembled a wagon or a horseless carriage made out of steel and other metals, with large, wooden cartwheels which were three or four feet in diameter and were just as tall as his hip. The seat which they sat abreast of each other on was comfortable and well-padded, in fact, it was actually and old sofa which was bolted down by the feet to keep it in place. Athens steered it with a "wheel" made out of the iron loop of a barrel and wore tough, leather gloves to protect his hands from getting cut by any sharp edges he hadn't already sanded out. The workmanship was admirable, although it was by no means perfect. Here and there, along the body, there were dents from a misplaced swing of a hammer. It was painted a noxious shade of green, almost florescent, and, along the sides, "MARVELOUS MACHINE" was written in bright yellow. On the hood, a large stencil of three balloons (one blue, a red one, and the last was purple) were drawn with their strings tied together and held in a disembodied hand. To the right of the balloon-holding hand, there was a clown's smiling face with gaudy make-up on it and it wore an orange wig.

Athens Ford was obviously a very pretentious man. Having gotten the idea of taking his invention to be shown off at a circus, he had gone to the trouble of actually making it looked it already was part of one. If he had been rejected by the circus's manager, Bleach had the feeling that he might continue to stubbornly insist that they needed him, that, after a while, they would come to him and beg on their hands and knees for forgiveness and so on until the poor man finally knuckled under and let Athens join up just so that he'd shut up about his damned machine's potential for earning the circus money. He had to admit, Athens could be just as tenacious at bartering with those show biz types, may even more so, as he'd expected him to be. 

Athens was saying, "---do you really like it? I modeled after the Little Engine that could. All my life, no matter what task had been set before me, I tackled it with the same determination and courage as that danged little sucker in my favorite story. He'd always say, `I think I can, I think I can,' and, you know what? He did! If you think you can do something, you will. If you don't, you won't. All ya gotta do is try!" He smiled again, this time with only his lips so his teeth wouldn't fall out again. After a second, he showed a little bit of teeth, then returned his attention to the road ahead.

Bleach asked him, "How does it work?" 
At that, Athens Ford stomped his foot hard on a pedal and threw back a metal lever. The Marvelous Machine all at once came to a screeching halt, and Bleach was thrown forward into the dashboard by the momentum. They hadn't been going too fast at all, but, if they were, he might of been tossed right out of his seat and collided head-first into the hot chimney and burned himself very badly. That was a close one!

"Why, I'll do better than tell you how it works, I'll show you! Come with me!" Athens jumped out of his seat onto the floor and landed as gingerly as a small child would of. Bleach did the same, but tripped on his own two feet and fell headlong into the dust. Athens was standing around the front of the vehicle, waving impatiently at Bleach in the manner of a child, eager to show a discovery to an adult, but too impatient for them to move in their own pace. In fact, the same impatience with which Bleach had acted with Granpa so long ago over the argument about a towel. Dismayed, Bleach pushes up off the floor and hobbles painfully around his side until he stands next to Athens.
Athens opens the hood of his car, revealing complex array of mechanics which would take a child as young Bleach or an old man like his grandfather a great deal of curmudegoning to understand. Athens points out the parts as he goes along. "This is a design of mine, the external combustion engine. I'm currently drawing up plans for an internal combustion engine, but I can't find the right materials to use. I once obtained a special elixir from a tradesman in Nistau who said that it was a nearly purified form of the stuff in the Black Tide. He said if I would invest in his wares, he may someday, with my help, find a way to actually purify that entire ocean's putrid toxins for abundant drinking water. Of course, that all was so much poppy cock, but I've found that the elixir is surprisingly flammable. Now, follow me. This engine is powered by two different cycles. First, I heat the water by burning the coal, the boiled water makes steam. Second, the steam passes through the turbines, creating motion.

"Of course, you can see that it would not be a very good idea if I kept boiling and boiling a great deal of water, over, and over, and over again. That would be all fine and dandy if I lived near a major body of water and always followed along it, but that would be both ridiculous and impossible as I've already **said that there is none abundant enough for this task. In fact, most people get their water from cactus-es or reconstituted whatever. So, using the process of---" said Athens in a lecturing tone of voice used by many pompous and brilliant people alike. The question is, what is the difference?

"Distillation," said Bleach. When it came right down to it, he actually knew a great deal about how machines worked, after all. He knew of distillation because that was how the people in the City of Eden had kept the water in their bath house so pure, from distilled hot spring water.

"Right!" said Athens. He applauded Bleach, literally clapping his hands together. Not knowing what was expected of him, Bleach bowed. "This tube, here, leaves the engine after the vapor has passed through the turbines, then goes down, along the bottom of the car," said Athens, trailing the tubing exactly and even climbing underneath his contraption, "this prevent the steam from re-entering the engine immediately. It goes up here, into this chamber underneath the seat where it is cooled by a mechanical bellows. The bellows are powered by each rotation of the rear-left wheel, see? The liquid is then pumped back into the engine. I guess you could say that my design is almost as efficient as the human body. The bellows are beating heart, the water is the engine's life blood which is continually recycled throughout the cycle. No haste makes waste." Athens started to breath deeply, both because he'd talked himself hoarse and also because he could tell that Bleach needed some time to let this all sink in.

As a child, he had been anguished by the way mechanical giant Grinlab had destroyed first the Licanthos forest, then his own mother, with out even a trace of emotion. Its face showed no trace of the characteristics of a creature which had a conscience. It had worked its evil deeds without mercy or a moment of pause. If it had expressed pleasure, grinning insanely as it chopped its great ax into the flesh of each tree, he would of felt a touch of disgust as well as fear. If it had re-directed its fury on the millions of animals which it displaced from their homes and even then were attacking it on all sides to no avail, he would of also been outraged. As it was, Grinlab was oblivious to the misery it was causing to all of those living things. If it felt the slightest twinge of pain as the birds pecked at its knees or the lion's teeth upon its arms or coils of a boa constrictor around its neck, it didn't respond in the least bit.

Once, after it had been completely overrun by beasts so that, to Bleach, it looked as they were all posing for some odd living sculpture only a complete genius or a lunatic would conceive and only hope of accomplishing. A living heap of inhuman creatures, of the entirety of life besides our own, all writhing together in an orgy of ferocious violence as if they all planned to fight to death so that only one of them would stand victorious among a hideous slaughter to proclaim itself the rightful King of the Jungle. A bizarre thought, but, with that most inhuman and conscious-less mechanical wonder absolutely covered from head to toe by the beasts which attacked it, that was the only conclusion you could make. Then, every single creature screamed in agony and left of their prey, fleeing in every possible direction. Some died and fell in a lifeless pile around Grinlab and others were trampled to death by the escaping menagerie. When they all were gone, Grinlab stood there shining even brighter than the Suns themselves with an incandescent yellow light for a few seconds.

When it had finished, it spit out an crude, black liquid on the heap of corpses which was the exact color with which the entire then-blue Pax-Atlantic Ocean would become in a year's time. It sparked once more and all of those dead creatures were burned in a huge, ring-shaped bonfire with Grinlab standing in the middle with a expressionless face. Afterward, after the fires subsided, it plowed through a wall of ash and set back to its work as if nothing at all had happened. No counter-attack, no murder, nothing. As if it hadn't even stopped doing what it was doing all of this time to defend itself. Most of all, it didn't show any regret whatsoever.
If a machine could do all of these things, carry out a single-minded task such as destroy the Forest of Tears completely and indiscriminately and efficiently dispose of whatever obstacles stood in its way, then leave once it's mission had been completed; Bleach could accept such mindless destruction even though it had so traumatized the rest of his life. However, to sit here and find out that a man like Athens Ford, an inventor, could create such a thing in the name of science and discovery of their own potential for creating "life" out of something which never lived was too much. Sure, Athens probably didn't make that horrific thing which haunted his dreams with the murder of his own mother, but the facts still stated that he could of been. Could of made something like it and sold it to some insidious person who then sent it on such a destructive rampage. That was unthinkable. And unforgivable.

Then again, looking into the wonder-lust in the man's eyes which would of been more appropriate in a child of, well, Bleach's age or younger, rather than the spectacled eyes of a man perhaps sixty or eighty years old. It was a look which seemed fundamentally out of place but strangely reassuring in its presence. He was used to seeing older folk with a contented, happy look in their eyes and faces, who always seemed to be smiling confidently no matter what happened as if it had happened to them a million times before in earlier years and they were used to it.

He had even seen those of the perpetually ill or disadvantaged who always seemed to be in some kind of excruciating pain but were too proud to cry out in agony. Those people looked at him, with his youth and dependably functional body, with aether an odd measure of envy or mild disgust. Such health is wasted on the young, is a thought he perceived of them thinking each time he saw that particular look.

But, worst of all, he had seen the eyes of the tragically old and wretched. Their eyes were too glassy, too pathetic, the hound-dog expression a dog would use to beg of its master for a treat. There was no clarity in those people's eyes, just a lost, sad expression. As if no cognizant thoughts rattled inside their heads except endless rhetorical question for which they had long-ago forgotten the answers: Where am I? Who are those people? Who am I? What am I doing here? Why can't I remember anything? This was the way he had always perceived babies, but at least babies have their entire lives ahead of them while the elderly have lived their entire lives but have forgotten every nuance of them.

Even though Athens Ford looked old, he didn't act like it, and thus left the impression that he had never been old for a single second in his entire life. The same way Bleach was only a decade old, but acted way too mature for his age. 

He had grown up quickly, during the course of five years, after his mother died. That was when he had lost the greatest piece of his faith in the world he lived in: the belief that his mother would always be there for him, no matter what happened or what he did to disappoint her. She had said all of that herself, with him sitting in her lap and enfolded in her loving arms as he cried and cried and cried. She said that when he was a baby and continued to say it every day, for five straight years. The last time she had said it was the morning before her death.

Bleach blinked a couple of times, rubbed the tears from his eyes, and saw Athens looking at him. Before he could speak, Athens winked an eye at him. He had no business knowing about what ails him so. Just a simple moment of nostalgia for things past. If he felt like talking about it, Athens would listen.

Bleach took a moment to collect himself, then spoke. "Alright, so you're saying that this thing is powered by steam, right? You just boil the water, then boil it again. So I assume this also eliminates the problem of having to carry around a cumbersome supply of fresh water whoever you go. All you have to drink is the distilled water which comes out of your machine, right?"

Athens took his cap off of his head and slapped it hard against one knee. "Well, yes'sir that's just about right! Except for the fact that, having gone through all that there dirty smoke, the dang water tastes so gawd-awful that I'd rather die of dehydration than drink the foul stuff. When making drinking water I make of point of getting a big kettle, fill that with water, then distill it with some tubes into pot sitting in nearby stream to cool it. Throw out the crud in the bottom of the kettle, then fill it back up with the same water. I distill it, screen out the impurities, then distill it again for about an hour before I drink it, then keep the stuff in a canteen. But at least you know some of the fundamentals. I 'spect you used ta live in that dang City of Eatin' with all their new-fangled ideas on how to do things, but they stole their process from me!"
Bleach stood there for a moment, shocked by this insight, but then began to laugh. Just then, for only a brief second, he had no idea what he was talking about, then he remembered. The City of Eden. The place he had lived for almost nine full years of his life. He had been displaced for so long that he had actually forgotten his own routes. He had also forgotten the fact that he had a brother, but that idea wasn't as funny as the other. He felt a little ashamed of himself, but the grief he felt was perfunctory. He really never had a chance to know his own brother, they had been apart for most of their lives. Now, he was the only one left of his line and the only surviving citizen of the City know that it had been destroyed. He had no faith that at least one other person had managed to escape before hand. Nobody ever left there by their own volition. It was paradise.

"So, kiddo?" said Athens. He was leaning over on the closed hood of his Marvelous Machine, arms folded, looking down at Bleach with casual impatience. "Got any more ideas ya want'ta throw my way? Well?"
Bleach blurted out the first thing he could think of: "The smoke!" Athens rolled his eyes a little and raised an eyebrow. "You could, um, do something so it wouldn't be, uh, chugging out a lot of smoke in your face all of the time. Maybe you could... do something about that? Right?" He said, hating himself for sounding so stupid.

Athens slapped his hand across his forehead in that timeless gesture. "You know, you are right! Perhaps I can divert it instead out the back instead in the front? Yeah! That would be a great idea! It'll make it a heck of a lot safer to maneuver the contraption without the smoke making my eyes all fuzzy! I wonder why I didn't think of it myself! I always said you kids had more initiative than us old fogies. Not as much brains, mind you, but more initiative," he said, more to himself than to Bleach. He held a hand out across the hood, Bleach shook it, and he took two running steps to the back of the car to fetch a tool box.

Bleach just stood there, silent. He put his hands in pockets, shook his head, then slowly got back in the contraption and sat on his side of the seat while the inventor set to work on the necessary modifications. He didn't bother trying to tell Athens the fact that, yes, while it may be a little easier on them, it would also be inconsiderate of them to blow all of their smoke in the faces of people he were traveling behind them. He had a feeling Athens wouldn't even care. He was engrossed in work at the moment to even consider a flaw in his plans.


Half an hour later, chugging along contentedly like the Little Engine That Could which Athens he had spoken of earlier, they came to the chaired remains of the sign post which he had watched Joe McDougle and his cohorts burn the night before. Bleach recognized the place because of the fence which went along of to one side. That, and the fact the was a small pile of dung, covered with buzzing flies, in the spot where Joe's horse had "went."

Surprisingly, it and the other horses hadn't spooked at the sight of the fire. It seemed they were as used to the sight as they were of the strange ways that their masters had dressed. 

Athens was furious. He fumed with anger and spat out a string of foul words, one after the other, so quick that Bleach couldn't even understand what he was saying but was certain that whatever they were, they weren't the kind of words you would use to address an elder with. He just pointed in the right direction, the one he had seen the sign pointing toward before it was set on fire.

Athens asked him if he was sure that was the way they had to go? He said he was, and Athens headed off in that direction. He didn't ask Bleach how he knew the way and Bleach didn't even try to explain to him. It didn't matter. Athens wanted to know the way and Bleach had told him. Nothing more, nothing less.

It occurred to Bleach, looking back on the events on the previous night, that there was a very thin line between a zealot and a nihilist. One had faith in the continued proof in favor of their beliefs and the other was just as dependent in the refuting of that proof. One was as dependent on those proves as the other was dependent on the lack of those things.
As far as Bleach was concerned, his loss in faith was both an omen of disaster to come and a welcome comfort.


Chapter Four:
 Burning Desire

THE CIRCUS: COME ONE, COME ALL!

������� A fat man in suspenders, with a great, big, top hat taller than his head with vertical red and white stripes and a blue field with many stars, was standing on a podium in the middle of the street at a town common. It looked as if he could pull it down over his ears, right down to his shoulders, and cover his whole head and neck with it and still have room to spare. Bleach giggled silently to himself at that thought. 
�
���� ���������� The fat man had a wooden cane with a bronze handle that he shook emphatically to punctuate at the end of each sentence. "Come one, come all! See the sights, smell the smells, and experience a veritable plethora of great and mystical things in our Big Top!" He waved the cane grandiosely toward a large tent that was cordoned off from the rest of the proper by a ten-foot fence that had its main gate open wide to welcome the public. A booth was off to one side from the open gate and people lined up there to get tickets. Thousands of people, of every size and shape, from all walks of life, waited aether patiently or with anxious expectation of the wonders there were yet to behold.
�
���� ������ Spattered on the fence, in intervals, were huge posters that promoted each and every thing to be seen inside. Each poster was four feet wide and six feet tall with large, fancily written legends in calligraphy Each and every poster had the same two legends: at the top read, "Come and see the AMAZING..."; at the bottom were the words, "At our CIRCUS OF THE MAGISTIQUE!"
�
���� ������ On one poster, the performer was called Kristofur, the Strong Man, "who could lift anything you could imagine over his head. Kristofur held a gigantic globe on his shoulders, kneeling down under his burden with his face red. He had an impressive amount of huge muscles in both his arms and his chest and a large, brown mustache under a rather hawkish nose. He grimaced as if in unbelievable pain, but Bleach guessed that the artist had meant to make it look as if the poor man was smiling confidently but didn't quite pull it off. He instantly reminded Bleach of Atlas, the titan who was charged with having to carry the entire world atop his shoulders as punishment for his crimes. Another poster depicted Rolento, the knife thrower. Still another showed Alcyone, the mermaid ("half
woman, and half fish. Not a very easy catch in aether case!"). There was another, �Gentlemen, do not forget to visit The Man Eater,� the meaning of which Bleach couldn�t even begin to guess. When he pointed this one out and read it aloud to Athens, the old man�s face became very worried and he looked at his ward in such a way that made him feel that he offended him.� 
�
���� ������ However, the two that really caught Bleach's interest were those of the PALACE OF THE PECULIAR ("What is it, you ask. Come and see this and many more oddities in our variety show; from odd curiosities to gruesomely monstrous freaks of nature. It's a Scream!") and another, much grander poster that displayed a profile of THE HUMAN DRAGON. The former was a compilation of the appendages of many different wild beasts pieced together in collage of life. It had the head of a lion, the wings of an eagle, the body of a horse, and some gigantic lizard's tail, to name a few. The latter showed only a pair incandescent eyes that seemed to burn as with a demonic fire and long, sharp fangs gleaming viciously. It had long, green hair that covered hung down well past its shoulders and partly over its face. The rest was masked with shadows, leaving only a glimpse of a chin and one check that appeared to be covered in diamond-shaped scales. Beneath the face was a reaching hand, with long, black nails and was entirely covered with the same scales. The entire effect was to intended indicate incredible savagery, but the inquisitive Bleach could see great intelligence in those eyes. 
�
���� ������ The fat man was shouting/ laughing/ singing in a boastful voice that was loud enough to be heard but at the same time pleasant to listen to. He was having a dialogue with a rather large woman in red dress who held a baby wrapped in blue (that signified it was a boy) and was an old woman, presumably her mother. "Come one, come all," chanted the fat man on the podium, shaking his cane in the air heartily. "Come see our shows and have the time of your lives while this wonderful circus still thrives. Because, if you don't you'll be outta luck and your friends'll call you a big, dumb cluck!"
���� 
����������� "Where can we see all of these marvelous things you have promised to show us, My Good Man?" asked the woman in red, jostling her baby back and forth in her cradled arms as it laughed and gurgled happily. She didn't appear to be putting much stock in what the man said.
�
����������� "Why, madam, to answer your question would be very simple. Now, if you would please loosen the knot in your wimple, that is making you so hard of hearing, step right into the line and all will be fine! And, for goodness gracious, do not sing, if you'd please; for, as the old saying goes, in doing so, you would bring on the end of our Grand Show!" he replied.
����������� 
���� ������ "What?" asked the woman in red, not understanding the last part of the man's speech A man in the crowd, considerably far away from where she was standing, clapped his hands to either side of his mouth and yelled, "What he means is: `It ain't over until the fat lady sings,' you old cow! If you were to sing, they'd have to cancel their show because that's what tradition says they should
do!" She ignored that. 
�
����������� "Well, is it as good as sermon in church?" asked the old woman while her daughter looked back and forth through the crowd to see if she could spot whoever insulted her. 
�
���� ������ "Why, madam, it would be a sin to say thus, but so you will not fuss, I'll say this: while it may not be as enriching for the soul as that most hallowed hall, the things that you can do here you won't forget (without regret); things that your pastor will not like at all!" he punned. At this many people, including the
woman in red and her mother, laughed at and most of them stepped foot in the line while the fat man turned his attention gravely to Athens and Bleach as they pulled over alongside of him.

���� ������ "Hello, friend," said Athens. This, as he'd told Bleach earlier, was the pitch. "In order to sell something, you must sell yourself first," he'd said. "I have here a most wonderful and truly Marvelous Machine of my own invention. I am the Great Gonzago and this is, um, my most noble, young apprentice, uh, Whitey," (he winked an eye confidentially to Bleach, who didn't like being called `Whitey' at all) "I was wondering if you might see it your way to include in your fabulous show..." 
���� 
����������� The fat man cut him off with an angry hiss, "Shut up!" He reached into a breast pocket of his coat and tossed a key at Athens. "Go around back! The door's locked, but you can use the key to open it. Once you're inside, tell the guard the password, that is written on the piece of paper attached to the key, and he'll take you to William. Now, get out of here before you suffocate some of my perspective curiosity seekers and drive them away. Get that piece of junk outta my face, NOW!" he said, jerking his thumb behind his back quickly.
�
���� ������ Athens held his tongue and stomped his foot on the accelerator, sending out an even blacker cloud of smoke into the air and zipped around the side of the building so fast that he almost hit a little boy who was running across the street after a bouncing ball in his haste. Bleach looked back and saw the fat
man break his cane across his knee and storm furiously into the front entrance. He said something like, "Show's almost over folks!" and disappeared into the black smoke. 
�
���� ������ Athens turned the corner and all of the previous promotions were repeated once more, two on one side, two on the other, yet there was a pair of double-doors in a wooden frame between the second and third posters. They opened outward and there was handle on the right hand door. Bleach took the keys and ran to the door. He knocked and waited for a response.� Yet there wasn't any.� So, he unlocked door and swung it open. 
�
���� ������ No sooner had he done that, a massive man with broad shoulders and a chest as thick around as a barrel reached out and grabbed his wrist with a� gigantic hand. The man walked on stubby little legs with his feet attached to wear his knees should of been, yet he more than made up for his height disadvantage with his inhuman strength. His head was small, with beady little black eyes and mashed in nose that looked as if had been broken more than once or twice during his life time and his ears were smaller than walnut shells. The knuckles on his hand looked as if he dragged them when he walked since the were bloody and filthy. This is quite understandable since it looked as if he were capable of walking on his hands while his legs dangled uselessly half a foot
of the ground. 
���� 
����������� The burly man stared directly at Bleach and regarded him coldly and with unmasked impatience. Bleach looked away, toward Athens, and the man followed his gaze to the kindly inventor. The man waited. "Let him go, you cretin!" shouted Athens, but the man wouldn't. Athens leapt from the car and rushed at him, but the man shoved him down to the ground roughly. There, Athens sat, surprised and more than a little teed off.
���� 
����������� Bleach looked again into the ape man's eyes and saw something he hadn't seen before.� Now, there was almost a doleful, stupidly animal quality to their gaze, a certain beseechingly earnest look; the one a dog might adopt to beg for a bone from its master. If he wasn't mistaken, the strange person actually mewled
at him. He finally understood why hadn't spoken from the outset. He smiled at the man, and the man returned the favor. He then looked back at Athens as the man let him go and retreated a step. Athens was still fuming, as he brushed his himself off. He had a befuddled look on his face that was absolutely comical.� However, he also looked angry enough to kill some one, any one.� Bleach spoke to him in a passive, serene voice, "It's alright now, Prof. Ford. This man is just mute. That's why he doesn't talk. He was just doing his job and doesn't really want to hurt any one." He turned back to the man. "Isn't that right?"
�
���� ������ The man had a confused look on his face and shrugged: Isn't what right? Then, Bleach knew that he also was deaf. Bleach spoke to him expressly, "I said: you cannot speak, so that's why you didn't verbally shout a warning and acted as you did. Also, you don't intend to harm us. Is that right?"

This time, the man smiled and nodded three times to show he agreed with everything Bleach had said to him. Okay, so he can read lips. He spoke to Athens, but still was looking at the nameless ape man so he wouldn't feel left out of the conversation, "Tell him who you are, Doc. We don't have all day. But, face him directly when you talk and speak slow enough so that he understands."
���� 
����������� Athens flustered for a while, still worked up by the sight of Bleach being handled roughly and being incapable of doing anything. He muttered something under his breath that neither of them could understand, then he slammed one fist into the palm of the other. He cracked his knuckles, then did the same with other hand. Athens made a little gesture to Bleach, silently asking him to come forward so he could talk with him. The man let him go without even the least bit of restraint. 
�
���� ������ Athens whispered in Bleach's ear, that seemed a little silly to him, considering that their friend was deaf, after all. "Give me the damned key, you idgit! Let me do the talking, okay?" Bleach gave him the key as he asked and admonished him to speak directly to the guard so that he would understand fully. Athens just slapped him lightly on the cheek with back of hand. "Now, sir," he said aloud. "Um, I was told to say whatever it says on this card here by this really bombastic man out front. I assume you know him, right?" The ape man smiled and nodded his bald head. "Well, any way, here goes nothing... `I am an inconsiderate and idiotic person and I would like you to take in some back alley some where and give me a kick in the ass because that's what I deserve' ?!!?"
Athens stared at the note for a second, then tore it to pieces in anger.
���� 
����������� The ape man laughed so hard that he fell over on his back, rolled onto his stomach, and began to beat the floor with fists as he laughed and laughed and laughed until he cried tears of joy. Bleach was dumbfounded for a moment, then laughed twice, saw the disapproval in Athen's indignant face, and stopped altogether. By that time, the ape man had recovered from his fit and was lifting himself off of the floor with those impossibly long and muscular arms of his. He whistled once, turned his back, and did something that looked more like a couple bunny hops than a walk. Upon seeing they didn't follow, he whistled over his shoulder and continued on without any further delay.
�
���� ������ When Bleach had caught up with him (Athens was still standing outside of the gate where he'd left him, breathing hard), he asked the man who he was. The ape man stopped immediately and held his hand out with the index finger pointing up, "Just a second, please," he appeared to be saying, and pulled paste-on mustache. He affixed it carefully on his face and Bleach recognized him instantly as Kristofur, the strong man who's likeness had appeared on one of the posters outside. Bleach asked him, "Why don't you look as well built now as you did on the poster?" Kristofur's replied by holding out both hand with all of his fingers out and the palms facing out. 10. He closed his hands into partial fists, then held up only his index fingers on aether side. 2. 10 + 2 = 12. "Oh, you're saying that was maid twelve years ago, when you were younger. Right?" Kristofur nodded. "Do you still perform?" Kristofur shrugged. Maybe.� Bleach looked back and saw that Athens had brought his car inside the gate, closed it, and was running towards them with the same youthful gait he had displayed earlier along the road. He seemed to be in a better mood. 


As they passed an alley between two old ramshackle carts, lengthening shadows spewing from the darkness into the lighter gloom of opening day, something small and agile leapt from the darkness and onto Athens' back. Its bare and sharp toed feet easily tied themselves about his shoulders and the figure firmly held both its hands over Athens' eyes. The old man swore, not at all amused at being set upon by unawares and not in the mood at playing games with his assailant. The figure seemed a hairy, disheveled boy who was covered from head to toe with shaggy, unwashed curls of dark hair and easily resisted the old man's struggles. The dirty boy was laughing soundlessly and inside his wide grinning mouth could be seen many sharp teeth.

"Get it off! Get it off! It smells! Get it off! Oh no! Get it off! It's wetting on my neck! Oh! Little shit is pissing on my head!" Poor Athens was shouting and all Bleach could do about it was laugh. Kristofur, however, was not laughing. He stood still with his shock riveted in his face and in his bearing, behaving in such away that almost caused Bleach to be shamed that he should find it funny.

Grudgingly, he lifted a tentative hand to the child to see if he could persuade it to get off of his friend or perhaps pull it off him, but the child bit his hand. This stopped the laughter dead. Bleach had time to curl the hand into a fist before the child leapt off of Athens, bounced off of his chest, and leapt into Kristofur's arms to hug the silent strongman. Kristofur held the boy, who now began to cry into his chest, and made a quick gesture over the boy's shaggy head that Bleach interpreted to be both an acknowledgment the boy was his son and a fatherly apology for the child's behavior.

As quickly as he had come, the boy left back in to the shadows. The threesome weren't too eager to make his acquaintance and shuffled on. Athens chose to not speak of the encounter and resolutely ignored the urine stains on the back of his shirt. Bleach was sure he'd burn it later, but now they had a meeting to carry on with.
��� ����������� Kristofur lead them to small shack near one corner of the gate, away from the rest of the attractions. It was outside of the Big Top, in the open air. A sign read: Manager's Quarters, Do Not Disturb. He opened the door and stood to one side as they went and then it behind them and shambled off.
�
���� ������ A man was sitting behind a large desk, that was littered with huge stacks over different colors and sizes. He swept these off of his desk and onto the floor as if they meant no more to him than just so many errant leaves. He pointed to a couple chairs that were across from him, on the other side of the desk. Then, he leaned back on his chair and put his feet on the desk, one foot crossed over the other, in a casual gesture. He folded his hands together and twiddled his thumbs busily and smiled benignly, but his eyes seemed to be a little too suspicious, as if he knew what this kooky old man and a small boy, that was presumably his grandchild, had in mind just by looking at them. 
�
���� ������ Athens was dazed by the man's nonchalant behavior and his steady gaze. He stood just inside the door, as if riveted to the floor, not moving even an inch. Their host, William, was a balding middle-aged man. He dressed modestly and had a shrewd way of carrying himself. The way he acted now was probably a well-thought-out ruse, practiced many times in the event of any surprises. As soon as they left, he would pick up all of the papers off of the floor, shuffle them a little, perhaps, in expectation of another interruption. If his visitor was a tax collector or some other man of rank, he would act more professionally, become a perfectly knowledgeable host.
���� 
Bleach grabbed Athens hand and dragged him over to the desk, the man laughed at this presumptuous behavior from a such a young boy. When Athens faltered before speaking, Bleach elbowed him slightly in the side and he shot is right hand out at the relaxing man so fast that he jerked in surprise as if a weapon were being brandished at him. He leaned over and shook hands and Athens muttered, "Nice to meet you, sir. My name is Ath... That is Professor Gonzago, stage name, you see... and I have brought with me something that you may find amazing...." he said, ruining his opening spiel because of his reluctance.
�
���� ������ The man cut him off, "The name is William, William Wright, please.� None of this `Sir' stuff, thank you. I was in the army for damn near seven years and if I can live the rest of my life without hearing that word again, then I can be contented for the rest of my days. Gonzago, is it? Peculiar name. Where is the marvel you have brought to show me? Is it, perchance, invisible? If it is then, no thank you, I already have thousands of those already; as you can see for yourself. Or is it cannot see? Whatever." The joke was sarcastic, but was gauged to be something called an ice breaker.
�
���� ������ Athens was perturbed by this remark, so Bleach decided to be his "mouthpiece." "Mr. Wanton, William. What my colleague means is that he has brought his `marvel,' as you called it, with him, yet it is outside at the moment. I am certain he would be very pleased to show it you at your leisure, if he may?" he said.
�
���� ������ William leveled a glance at the young boy, mild annoyance was conveyed in that short, lingering look. His eyes lazily rolled towards Athens Ford, who was sitting complacently in his chair, fidgetly plucking the collar on his shirt. "The kid talks too damn much, old man," he said. "You ought ta cuff the bastard behind the ears a few times and teach him a little respect."
���� 
Athens turned red with anger and shot forward in his chair. He grabbed the man's right foot and twisted his ankle a little, then elbowed his shin when he yelped in pain. After relinquishing his hold, William swiveled in his chair so that he was now standing up and leaning over on his desk. "What the hell do you think you're doing, old man?!!?" he shouted.
�
���� ������ Athens hooked an arm around the man's head, tweaked his nose, then sat down hard in his chair. He used the momentum and his weight to drive the man's balding head into the hard wooden top of his desk. "I'm teaching you some respect, you little whipper snapper! You should never speak that way to your elders!" He cuffed the man's ear, as he had suggested him to do earlier. "Don't mess with a professional, youngster, I used to be a pretty good rastler in my youth. And I ain't so old to clobbered a whelp like you." He punctuated this by pounding his fist on the table.
�
���� ������ At the sound of the commotion, someone new came into the room through the door, followed by Kristofur. This man was as broadly shouldered as the former, but much taller. He looked like a lumberjack to Bleach, dressed in a plaid corduroy shirt with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows. His chin was muscular and had a stubborn upward tilt; unshaven for perhaps many weeks, but he had no real facial hair besides this. He had a large scar that crisscrossed his right eye, nearly rendering useless. He squinted with scarred eye and the other was wide with vast suspicion. From his belt, he pulled a cruel, serrated knife and brandished it with an odd dexterity incongruous with a man his size.
���� 
William, the boss of the Circus, propped his elbows on his desk and physically lifted his head up in his hands. He had a large bruise on one temple that was even now turning a shade of dark blue. He addressed the unexpected visitors first, saying, "It's all right, Gentleman. These two were just making a proposal and things got a little out of hand. You may be dismissed, Kristofur," upon the mentioning of his name, Kristofur nods succinctly and leaves. "As for Rolento, remind to me talk with you about that temper of yours, friend. Capiesh?" Rolento growls a threat to Athens and Bleach, then stalks angrily out and slams the door behind himself.
�
���� ������ "Ah, yes. If I'm not mistaken, you had expressed a desire to `teach me some respect,' well consider the first step in my lessons: I'm letting the two of you live despite of the harm you have caused me. Normally, for such behavior, and much less, I would have ordered the two of you killed by one or all of my people. We, the Circus crowd, that is, are a very closely knit group. No infractions of one's personal space goes unpunished --- that includes their personal well being, of course. Do you get my drift?" He did not even wait for an answer. "Whoever, the reason I did not is because, Mr. Ford, you have something that we in show business call `balls.' It has two meanings: first and foremost, you have intestinal fortitude, or the desire and ability to do something no matter what the consequences that they bring. Also, it refers to the fact that you are a true man, not a gelding or weak-willed woman. Sir Athens Ford, you have balls. I like that in a man. So, for that one reason, you are still alive and I have decided to let you join our little itinerant family. Any questions?"
�
���� ������ Athens crossed his arms and looked adamantly at William Wright. "Yeah, I have a question. Why do you keep calling me by real name when I told you that it was Gonzago?" he asked in a voice that clearly fit his mood.
�
���� ������ William Wright laughed. "Because, my friend, I have certain ways to determine such things. I have methods that I will not bother to go into detail upon explaining to you. Just feel free to believe that learning who a complete eccentric like you was did not take a very long time to ascertain. I knew that you would invariably come here after you'd finished your little project of yours. All of the crackpots think that whatever they've managed to accomplished, it gives them the perfect right to enroll in my establishment. I am very selective of the people I choose to employ here, especially you!" he said, peering at Athens with a sick grin on his face. The look of contempt that this inspired in the man's elder made it look almost like a predatory show of emotion; he was getting a lot of satisfaction from this reaction. 
�
���� ������ Athens Ford shot out of his seat like a bolt of lightning and thunder toward the door without saying another word. Just as clasped the door knob in his hand and began to turn it, William Wright said something behind his back that made him pause. He said, "We are very knowledgeable people, Mr. Ford. What we don't already know about a person, we find out very quickly. Before you leave this office, let me give you a little free advice: make any mistakes and we will hold you responsible for them. If you do something wrong, that we don't agree with, then you might find yourself out on the street or in a jail cell somewhere along the line. Do something really wrong and it may be the last thing you ever do. Catch my drift? Now, have a nice day!" Athens was visibly shaken by this and he left, very cautious not to slam the door behind him.
�
���� ������ As Bleach got up, he glanced quickly at the pile of papers on the floor. Thanks to his odd, seemingly sightless eyes, William Wright could not tell exactly what he was looking at. He thanked the man behind the desk and left without offering to shake his hand out of courtesy. The were all the same document, written in different hand writings and on various sizes and colors of paper, but they all said the same thing. It was file on Athens Ford. Each and every detail about the man was painstakingly recorder: everything from his date of birth, to the fact that he had false teeth. Mr. Wright had even gone to the trouble of copying Athen's signature several times until he had gotten it just right.� This told Bleach, much more than the things that he'd actually said, that they were dealing with a very dishonest man. Man who could become very dangerous in the long run. What had Athens gotten the two of them into?
�

���� ������ After their meeting with Circus's ringleader, the unscrupulous Mr. William Wright, Kristofur showed them the way to an unused wagon where they were meant to set up camp. Athens parked
his Marvelous Machine outside of their living quarters, took a brief check to see that everything was in proper working order, then sent Bleach out to run a few errands. It took him a while, but he had finally recovered from their first meeting with their new boss and had regained that certain "bounce" in his step that he normally had. He was happy they had been accepted, yet he hadn't forgotten everything that had been said. He even gave Bleach a neatly written list of things he wanted him to do, right down to how long it should approximately take him to accomplish each task.
�
���� ������ First thing on the agenda, he was supposed to try and the find the barker who ushered them in and give his key back to him. Athens also told him to give the man a piece of mind as well, but Bleach decided to omit that last part. Secondly, he was to find out where the food was being served and bring that back for their dinners. He found a fat man wearing a dirty shirt, who assumed to be a chef because he was stirring a large pot of something that looked like gruel with a long handled, wooden spoon.
�
���� ������ "Naw, this ain't for grub, kid," the fat man said, still stirring the hideous contents of the pot as he talked. "This is for the pigs to eat.� Say, do you work here?" Bleach said yes."Well, I assume you met the boss, have you? What did you think of his long, flowing hair.� He kind of reminded you of Goldilocks in that story with the three bears, did he?" Bleach told the man that William Wright's head was balder than the baby's the day its born; and with the same disposition, too. The fat man laughed at that. He took the spoon out of the pot, wiped it off on his shirt, then put it in his back pocket. Bleach would never of eaten anything this man prepared, even if he was starving and his life depended on it. "I was just testing you, kid, and you passed with flying colors! See that tent over there, that's our Mess Tent. We call it that because it's always a mess in there! They'll give you something to eat. I think today's special is fried chicken. Either that or rat gut stew!" He laughed at his own sick jokes and Bleach ran off the way the man had pointed, having lost his own appetite at meeting such a complete slob.
�
He stirred from his dreamless sleep and looked across to the aged person lying in the northwest corner of the room. Bleach rolled over from his stomach onto his back. The noise that had awaken him wasn�t coming from the sleeping old man. Well, it probably wasn�t the snoring and groaning and moaning and even the shouted expletives in a dialect that was so strange to his young ears that he wasn�t sure if it was spoken or the sound of a pig farting. Athens sure made a lot of disgusting noises when he slept. Completely unlike his grandfather. His grandmother always slept a soundless sleep� Bleach�s eyes shifted from the old man to his own toes which had extricated themselves from the suffocating depths of the blanket. Had he ever heard or even seen his Grampah sleeping? Did he even know for sure if the agling ever did sleep? Certainly if he did� he wasn�t a gross noisome beast like his current roommate. In the dark of early dawn, he smiled for the first genuine time since he had shared a bed with the rambunctious McDougle twins. 

Before he could wonder about them, a voice spoke from outside the door and he realized what had waken him up.

"Hello there." 

It wasn't a voice he heard before. Curiosity might have caused him to look up to see who was speaking, but he wasn't in a very curious mood. He rubbed his eyes.

"Well, you're a rude little boy aren't you?" The door had been opened just a crack, bringing a small sliver of light into the room in which he was hiding. He guessed that the speaker was carrying a lantern, so that must mean it wasn't night. There weren't any windows in the room, so it would be dark any way even if it were still day time. He could tell that it was a lantern because the light it gave was somehow insubstantial... it pulsated... it didn't feel cheerful. Maybe the light was mocking him?

"You're the one who forgot to knock," he observed. 

The stranger laughed. The door opened wider.

"Could you close that door?" He wanted to tell this person, whoever they were, that he didn't want company. Would of insisted that they leave. But he somehow couldn't. He'd already been accused of being rude, so he didn't want to prove this person right.

The door closed, but the person with the lantern had already stepped inside the room. The figure holding the lantern laughed mischievously. At this moment, Athen�s eyes sprang open and he sat bolt upright with a curse and a loud, noxious fart that sounded like a trumpet flourish. The intruder gasped (whether from his waking or from the sound or smell of the flatulence cannot be told), and then a strange cloud of smoke hit Athen�s face just as he turned to face the intruder. Bleach had managed to jump from his bed, but he tripped in the covers and fell to his hands and knees. And he realized that it wasn�t smoke, it was sand, because a handful of it was thrown into his face as well. They both lay howling in pain and writhing, trying to rub the sand from their eyes, as the intruder ran straight for the door and out. 


Author's Preamble for December 17 of 2015 for �Journey of the Pale Pilgrim.� 

Many things happen in the previous book. Bleach meets a blustery elf who reveals an amazing magical oneness with the natural world. Regretfully Bleach cannot stick to his diet and accidentally kills he elf's wife during his hunt. This experience changes him completely. 

He also finally meets a family of farmers, experiencing first hand hospitality, hatred for the unknown, and how different it is to be given a hand of friendship only to be struck with it later on. 

After that, Bleach meets the childlike yet elderly inventor Athens Ford. Athens wants to find fame from  his new invention: a horseless carriage. Bleach is then taunted by a young woman who looks fairly familiar but he knows not why. 

Journey of the pza;e pilgrim: part     four of the dove  n crow saga

It was a small tent. 
From the outside, it didn�t look like much of anything to Bleach. It was a plain thing, really. 
He was sure he�d walked past it several times in the day and still never really managed to notice it as he passed. 
It could have been just any tent, by looks alone; it looked as common as any other and maybe even the least noteworthy. That was, if he only looked at tent itself and not what was around it. 
But, what was around this tent was completely unlike any other. This one had a line in front of it. While lines of people waiting for one of the attractions was also not too unusual in a circus, this line was unequivocally the longest. 
Those waiting in this line to this ordinary looking tent stretched completely around the tent five times in a huge spiral. It was surprising to find that not only were the people waiting in this one line were content to stand for as long as several hours just to hold their spots; those who attempted to cut into it before their turn were summarily beaten senseless by at least five of the waiting horde and thrown out where the newcomers would trample on their unconscious bodies on their way to the end of the line. It was very clear that cheating your way into this ordinary tent was an exceptional offense. 
And, more surprising than its length was the fact that only men waited for whatever it was which was in that tent. No women or children seemed allowed in it. Typically, each man would excuse himself from his family and then take his spot while they went elsewhere. Most of the men would kiss their wives and take their leave them with kisses and hugs and smiles. Bleach saw several farmers arguing with their wives for the right to wait in this line and almost come to blows. The women would mostly relent and turn their faces from their husbands in disgust, dragging their children away with them. But these arguments happened so infrequently that waiting here seemed here seemed to be a man�s duty. But waiting for what? 

And here was another mystery: what would the sign in front of the tent say about it�s contents? �Man-Eater.� Bleach scratched his head at that. Why would anyone wait in line to be eaten? But it seemed the sign actually was telling a lie since men did leave the tent not long after entering it, so they weren�t eaten at all. 
�
For five days, he had walked past this unexceptional little tent and it�s completely incomprehensible line of waiting men. He had walked past it for five days and never found out what it was. On the second day, he had asked one of the patient men and the person had flinched as if he�d been stung by a snake and turned his back. Several other men laughed at the back-turner�s discomfort. When he persisted to ask, the back-turner shouted in his face and told him �young boys asking such questions should be ashamed of their curiosity.� But this only instilled the mystery even deeper into him.
�
He had asked around dozens of times with the other workers of the fair ground and every time he was laughed at. The cook made some obscene comment that drew even more laughter and only puzzled Bleach mightily. He didn�t see anything funny. The words were so incomprehensible to him that they seemed to be of some different language entirely. Something about something called the �oar� was supposed to make its �nest� in it. Somehow he doubted men would wait in line with an oar, especially since there were no large bodies of water and thus no boats either.
�
And he had no better luck looking for any clues because there weren�t any signs at the end. Passing by it very late at night, he managed across the tent when there wasn�t anyone waiting around it. He wasn�t sure if this were the right one but it seemed to be in the right spot. There was a sign in front of it, but it was blank except for the word �Welcome� and a strange symbol. It was an arrow with piercing a target. But he some how waited archery would have been this popular. That, and he the fact that the tent wasn�t nearly large enough to allow for a decent shot. It wasn�t big enough to throw a stone, let alone fire an arrow inside of it.
�
Finally, his curiosity at its absolute worst after five days of not learning what secrets lay within, he could finally not stand to remain unenlightened. He made his way to it carrying a mop and a bucket. The bucket was filled the chef�s putrid swill to its absolute top so that it continually sloshed over as he walked. It smelled and looked so putrid that any man who got too close to him or whose foot it spilled upon would immediately step aside or vomit in disgust. So plainly, carrying a bucket of stew was the surest way to granted pass.
�
He finally reached the end of the line and cautiously peeked his head in the flap. At fist, he was shocked to see that men were actually taking their clothes off on their way in or putting them back on their way out. The laziest of which were shuffling about with only shirts on and their pants around their ankles. In the center of the tent, as many as half of a dozen men were standing in a circle. Why any man would want to wait for over an hour just to stand naked around other men was beyond the young boy�s understanding. Clearly these farmers were an odd breed. 

Then, one of the men shifted his weight from his right foot to his left and then stepped aside. As he moved aside, Bleach suddenly saw a woman�s face. Her hair was cut very short for a woman�s hair and was dark. She had a pretty face, or as much of what he could see of her from around a couple of men�s skinny asses, she looked pretty enough.

So there was a woman here. But why would naked men be standing around a seated pretty girl? Bleach frowned and moved a little closer to the woman. She glanced over at him and smiled at him and said, �Maybe when you�re older, sweetie.� She laughed and winked at him. 

Bleach honestly couldn�t understand what it was that these odd people were doing and wasn�t sure he wanted to know. Certainly he felt no need to find out later on, either. And, apart from that, she had smiled at him as if she had some secret knowledge about himself or some secret she was glad to know about that he was too young to contemplate. Surprised, confused, maybe even a little shocked at his discovery, he ran straight out of the tent and managed to collide with Athens who was waiting in line. �Oh, there you are, boy! I� uh� was looking for you. Haha. I thought I saw you come in here� this is no place for a boy� uh, well� you look� well, as funny as it is for me to say so, you look as if you had seen a ghost.� Athens laughs and claps him on the back. �Well, you look so much like a ghost, perhaps you had seen your own reflection? Haha. Well, anyway� I wanted to tell you I haven�t found out who it was that assaulted us in the night. But I am sure, whoever it is� they are still in this camp.� He brushed Bleach�s clothes off and absently slapped him on the rump. �Now, go on� go play some games you boys play or whatever� this really is an attraction meant for men.. so if, you�ll excuse me..� Athens stepped into the tent without saying goodbye and that was it. Several men laughed as the frightened boy skulked off. 
 HALITOSIS: THE DRAGON'S BREATH

The scene is the central big top of the Circus. Bleach sold tickets for nearly two hours in the sweltering heat of the day. He was locked in a little shack in the front of the Circus. A person in the line would walk up to the window on the front of the shack and give him the money. He would count it, then give them the correct number of tickets. A large poster above his head read:

"Tickets Adults, $5.00.
Children under 8, $3." 

Apparently, must of the population did not know how to count. Most people would either give him too much money or not enough. Quite frankly, he had been bored. Something that would seem to be an impossibility to those who knew him well. Finally, a tall woman wearing a gray dress with several, patches on it unlocked the door and said he could go watch the Main Attraction as long as he volunteered to tidy the place up after wards. He thanked her by kissing her check lightly and she gave him an old broom that may of been a Witch's Broom. He straddled it like an imaginary horse went skipping toward the Big Top, pretending he was flying just like a real witch would in the ghost stories Grampah used to tell him when he was younger.

He went around back of the huge tent in the center of the fairway and Kristofur let him in. When Kristofur asked him what the he was doing, he explained that he pretending to be a witch. Kristofur looked gravely at him, then shook his head adamantly. He made a show of pantomiming in the manner of parent correcting his child, but he burst out laughing in the middle of it. Bleach laughed, too, and began to sweep the floor when somebody walked past and glanced at them apprehensively.
�
���� ������ Tonight's Main Attraction was none other than the Human Dragon. Bleach hadn't met him yet, but he was getting a good view of the man's act from his post backstage. In deed, this figure, true to his name, is a human dragon. His hands and feet are clawed with razor-sharp talons on each of his six fingers and toes. Startled, Bleach recounts and sees that the last two fingers on each joined into one, the same for the last two. A thumb and two "fingers" on each hand. His skin is green and scaly, like a reptile's, and he has a long, flowing mane of orangish-red hair that lays hap-haphazardly about his shoulders. He is clothed only in a simple sash that hangs from his shoulders and is tied at his waist, barring his arms, legs, and muscular chest.
�
���� ������ The Human Dragon roars, shaking his deformed hands angrily over his head. The crowd yells its raucous appreciation. A live chicken is thrown into the shallow pit that he stands in. Pyre bites its head off in a gory festival of carnage, then throws its beheaded corpse into the air.
�
���� ������ The chicken flaps its useless wings mindlessly in the air, kicking its feet as if it intended to run away. Suddenly, The Human Dragon spits out a ball of fire and the flightless fowl is instantly engulfed in flame. He catches the cooked chicken and begins to devour it greedily.
���� 
A curtain falls, signaling the end of his performance. The crowd does a standing ovation, clapping their callused hands together madly and screaming, "Encore!" at the top of their lungs until they turn horse. When there is no answer, they leave.
�
����� After the last straggler had shuffled out of the tent --- some may have been disappointed that the show hadn't lasted as long as they'd expected, but each and every one of them, no doubt, were satisfied that the act was very convincing --- a garbled voice, as if the speaker had a mouthful of marbles, called from the bottom of the pit: "Hello, up there! Could you please throw me a rope so I could climb out, eh?" Kristofur didn't hear this, but Bleach fetched the rope from its peg on the wall and repeated the message to him.
�
���� Kristofur walked over to the edge of the pit. It was about was about six feet in diameter and was approximately six or seven feet deep. The walls of the pit looked like it was just a mere hole in the ground, but Bleach could see some patches of bare stone in several places, indicating that it had once been a shallow well. Standing at the bottom was the fierce-looking fire-eater.� Looking down at him, Bleach could see that the man was not as ferocious as he'd seemed during his act. Rather than breathing fire, the smoke that came forth from his lips looked to be steam; he was shivering in the cold pit. He wasn�t a Human Dragon after all, just a shivering man with green-painted skin. 
�
Now, he acted quite humbly, with an odd measure of confidence and boredom. He waved to Kristofur and Kristofur flung some of the length of the rope down.� The green man caught it, tied it around his waist, then waved again, signaling that he was ready to come up. Kristofur slowly but steadily reeled the rope back in, as if he'd caught a fish.� Pretty soon, The green man was reaching a hand up from over the edge and Kristofur helped him. The green man shook Kristofur's hand and thanked him for his trouble. Then, he looked down at Bleach and paused for a
second. He glanced at Kristofur without saying a word, and Kristofur answered the unspoken question: Yes, you can trust the kid. The green man leaned over and smiled, showing tremendously sharp fangs. When Bleach recoiled from this sight, The green man
laughed and took out his teeth and showed Bleach that they were actually false. What is with these people and their teeth, thought Bleach. Does any one here have their own set of teeth or not?
Without the get-up, Pyre's features were elfin with long, lanky arms and legs and a peaceful, well assured face. He looked almost like a prince. In deed, as they conversed, Pyre admitted he had once been a prince. A true prince of royal blood and an affluent family. The tale he told was an interesting one. Even as each word was spoken, Bleach had the odd notion that he'd heard it before. Many years ago. The same odd feeling of deja vu which he'd felt upon hearing the McDonalds sign "Row, Row, Your Boat."

�
���� "Pleased to make your acquaintance, young man. I am, as you already know, �The Human Dragon�. Fire-eating is my trade. If you wish, you may call me Pyre. It is not my real name, but it is one that I prefer to known as. It means, `Fire,' as if you did not already know it." Without the encumbrance of his false teeth, the performer spoke in a pleasant, if not urbane manner which a high-class citizen would speak in; highly polite, with a slight musical lilt when pronouncing some words. In deed, his voice rivaled (if not surpassed) that of Lady Phyllus, the Elven Maiden. Only his own mother singing a nursery rhyme could possibly have been any more welcome to his youthful ears.

�Not just fire, sir,� Bleach corrected. �A pyres are used to burn the bodies of the dead as a ceremonial funeral. Bonfires are the more commonly spoken variety because they are lit on cheerful rather than somber occassions.�
�
���� �Wonderfully said, young man,� replied Pyre. �Certainly I have seen many sad faces and smiling ones in the glow of a fire in my life. To be truthful: I somehow find more comfort in being around mourners, such is my wont.� He looked at Bleach in a much more personal level, looking deeply into those extraordinary eyes of his. He held a hand up to Bleach's face and snapped his fingers twice.
�
Bleach blinked his eyes. Pyre asked him a peculiar question just then, "Can you see, lad? You as though you could not, yet I am not sure that you are actually blind. I have this keen sense that you are completely aware of the world around you, but I cannot see anything in your eyes. Watch my finger, if you would." He held out his right hand, index finger pointing up, and moved from side-to-side and up-and-down. Bleach followed his hand throughout, his eyes conveying none of his attentiveness. Pyre shook his head, confused.
���� 
Bleach pointed at the center of Pyre's chest. "What's that?" he asked. When Pyre looked down, he flicked his nose with his finger. "Made you look!" laughed Bleach, pleased with the effectiveness of such an old, childish jest.
���� 
Pyre looked at him strangely. All at once, Bleach stopped laughing. Then, Pyre laughed. To Bleach, it sounded more like a little girl's bubbly, giggling laugh than a grown man's. "You know, I have grown tired of the jokes which young people tell. They are vulgar, disrespectful and very barbaric. So-called practical jokes' are the worst; some one always trying to get some one else to trip on a banana peel or some thing such as that." With that, Pyre stood up, put
on a long, hooded cloak of red color (which covered him completely from head to toe) that Kristofur had given him, and motioned toward the exit.� Bleach followed outside and they turned left on their way to Pyre's quarters which was in a lone tent near an old, withered tree. 

Right beside it stood a little pen which housed horses, dogs, and mules. They smell of dung and hay reeked in the hot, mid-day Sun. Bleach pinched his nostrils close at the scent while Pyre apologized for the stench and told Bleach, "you'll get used to it after a while." He held the flap open long enough for Bleach to precede him and let it fall closed.
�
���� He walked over to a stool which faced a small bureau, complete with a dusty, mostly shattered mirror. Pyre washed his face with a rag and hot water and removed his dragon make-up. The wig he placed on a dummy's head. He put the teeth in their own, specially marked container. He did the same with the claws and the sash. The scaly, muscular skin was actually a layer of skin-tight, coarse fabric which he peeled off of himself and rolled into a neat ball. 

Still wearing the red cloak, he put on a set of pauper's clothes and a pair of sandals. He wore an old, moth eaten shirt which had been dyed many colors and was faded in several places. 
�
Chapter Five:
� �A Walk in the Clouds.�

I

(A Story, as told by Pyre.) My father was a very old man, you must understand. He feared death so much that he only wished to live life to its absolute fullest. He'd conquered many lands and set up a vast Empire of mankind. Some say his palace was the corner stone of the Fagrod Empire. So covetous was he that insisted that we, his family, only be served with gilded dishes encrusted in many precious gems. My brothers --- of which there were many, so fruitful was my mother --- shared his avarice for richly decorated and valuable possessions and were happy only when their surroundings were greatly embellished with such splendorous things. I, on the other hand, thought that only the peasants which my father ruled over were truly content.
�
���� I befriended an old miller who had two identical daughters who resembled each other in every possible aspect. I loved both of his daughters more than I had ever loved any single person before. He used to delight me in tales of a son he had once who, according to legend, looked remarkably like myself. I was so flattered by this that I begged of him to think upon me as his long lost son now reclaimed.
�
���� The son's name had been Buhrne (pronounced "Burn"), so Buhrne I became. My father would of never condoned what might seem to him to be foolhardy behavior, yet my gracious mother helped me to pull the wool over his eyes. She insisted that my reason for visiting the miller and his family was to strengthen my own feelings of self importance in comparison to the squalor they lived in. However, as wanton as he was, my father issued one strict ultimatum: I should bring my own flatware from the castle to eat my meals on. He actually believed the gold could kill all impurities in the food which was placed upon it. The idea of any of his sons eating off of a commoner's plate was as incomprehensible as my actually loving a person of peasant status.
�
���� One day, when I returned to the palace after my most recent visit to the miller, I arrived in the middle of a great commotion. It seemed a wandering sorcerer from a distant land had enchanted my father. He told him that whatever he touched would turn into gold. By the time I arrived, my father had already alchemized (for an alchemist is said to be on skilled in forming gold from many baser components) two sheep, a glass of water, a copper coin, a pair of my mother's diamond earrings, and six of my brothers. 
�
The rest of my family was hiding behind locked doors for fear of being transformed into statues.
�
���� My brothers stood throughout the house, all frozen in various grotesque emotional states; some were either scared out of their wits or just mildly surprised. As I walked through the halls of the palace, I came upon a corridor where everything I saw, from ceiling to floor, was covered in gold. 
�
A soldier stood at attention eternally to one side of the door. A dog sat up beside him, its mouth open, tongue lulling out, and one paw offered out as it wanted to shake hands. There was even a few droplets of golden spittle hanging from its tongue. There had been also a gilded rose in a gilded vase with a golden bee trapped within its petals. 
�
���� Then, I heard this horrible scream. My father came charging out of one room at the end of the corridor. His hair had been turned solid gold in several places. The bunches hair stuck out like weird horns. I could only assume he'd been rubbing his hands through his hair when it happened.� When he saw me, he cried out in relief and ran towards me. I shrank from him because I was afraid of his touch, yet I could not move from the spot I stood in. He tripped over the dog's out-stretched paw and fell heavily upon me. His hands formed gold circles in the stone floor around my head. The fall had knocked him unconscious. I grabbed his wrists, careful to avoid brushing against his hands, and rolled him off of me. I ran away that day.
�
���� A week later my mother found me in the care of the miller's. I had fully adopted my alter ego as Buhrne as my true identity and had become the miller's son, if only by deception. She had a pair of guards force me into a carriage against my will and we returned to our castle. On the way, she revealed to my shocked ears the worst I had ever heard during my entire life --- that night I had so narrowly avoided my father's lethal touch, he had wandered into the library and had seen a statue of me in the library. That's what caused him to scream. "The truth is, Claudio, although your father and I have had many children, you were always his favorite and youngest child. The very idea of losing you drove him off of the edge," she said to me.
�
���� Ever since that day, he had sworn off food. "Why should I try? It would only turn into some inedible hunk of worthless gold?" However, my mother was convinced that the fact I had escaped unscathed was proof that the magic had worn off. I didn't have the heart to tell her that he hadn't actually touched me that fateful night.
�
���� She tried with all of her might to convince my father he had not turned me into a statue, but to no avail. He took one look at the rags I wore and insisted that I was not his son. Plead as mother was wont to do, he would not eat. He cursed himself for ever trusting the sorcerer who had given him the ability to turn anything into gold with a mere touch. He then renounced his claim to the throne and spat on the floor.
�
���� When my mother asked him to reconsider his actions, he flashed her a horrible look of loathing. His gaze passed over the jeweled tiara she wore on her head, her long hair braided with ruby studded tresses, and her necklace diamonds. Her hands were decorated with rings, each delicate finger was encased in a golden band with many different precious gems. He then sat up in bed as she shrank from in fear.
�
���� He made one final commandment, "As my final duty as king, I offer up all possessions I have in this world as an inheritance to all people in this kingdom. All of the money they have paid in taxes will returned to each every one of them, with a generous stipend as well. This palace and everything in it will no longer belong to me and my family alone. Now, it will be torn apart, piece by piece, and whoever desires their share of wealth shall have it --- with a price. For every precious thing a person shall receive will only increase their hunger for more and more. I only hope that no one else is so succumbed by greed that they are afflicted with my disease. From this day, may it be called after myself, so it will forever be known as the Midas Touch." After saying all of these things, my father died.



II
���� 
Pyre paused. The world which Bleach had imagined while listening to his friend's tale vanished, as all day dreams will at a time. "So, at the price of my father's life and everything he'd cherished most in this world, including myself, I had finally acquired my own freedom to live as I wished. After wards, I had lost interest in my fleeting love in the miller's twin daughters and bade them farewell. I joined up with this nickle and dime operation three years ago and have been performing here ever since." He bowed.
���� 
Bleach clapped his small hands together in vigorous applause to the storyteller's skills and Pyre bowed once more and then a third time. "Wonderful story!" he cried.
�
���� Pyre thanked him. "Yes, I thought you would think so. Do you, per chance remember being told it by your mother many times before as a small child?" he asked.
���� 
"How did you---?" Bleach started to ask, but was too befuddled to continue. Pyre filled him in. "How did I know about what you would know from your childhood? Well, the answer is simple: because I was there. I lied when I said Buhrne was the name of a simple miller's son. It is my own. Our mother gave it to me. Bleach, I am your brother."
�
���� �What? But that is impossible! It can't be! I have no brother, at least, not any more. My only brother, Ebon, was killed during a surprise attack by Timbre the elf. I saw his coffin burst into flames right before my eyes!" He began to cry in mourning.
�
���� "You were always the emotional one, brother. Ivor. The name represents your truthful and pure spirit more than any other could. The truth of the matter is this, I am your brother. I was born to the Green Lady, our mother, but my father was not Alcrad the Usurper as yours and our brother's was. I am half elf. My father, instead, was Lorenaldell'a the Ancient. Other wise known as Lore. The grief he had for this world's misery made him grow old and withered. None other of the elves have ever become such as he. He used to be Natharas, which means `Swan Rider.' He still lives among the elves, yet he has lost his power of transformation for he wants to be nothing more than an old man. So, in honor of his wishes, they made him their king."
�
���� Bleach refuted these things. "How do know you're not lying to me? Why is it I have no memory of ever knowing you? Can you explain any of these things to me so that I can more certain whether or not you are lying to me?"
���� 
Buhrne was not dismayed. Rather, he acknowledged each new challenge with silence and only nodded his head. Then, he spoke, "Well, you are certainly full of questions, now aren't you? The grief which had affected my father so greatly, as I have said, was the result of his seeing his wife in an adulterous act one night, ten years ago. That was the night you and your twin brother were conceived." Buhrne fell silent and bowed his head in mourning. "His eyes had deceived him. I was the only one who ever discovered the truth, but it was too late, then. Our mother loved Lore with a dedication which no man could ever possess. She had been defiled against her will by a stranger. You are alive today only because she had mercy enough in her heart to spare your lives from my wrath."
�
���� Buhrne clenched his right hand into a fist as he relived the anger he had been so possessed with ten years before. At first, it began to turn red, then it burst into flames and his eyes glowed a fiery scarlet color. However, the fire did not eat away the flesh from his hand, yet seemed to emanate from his hand like intensified body heat. The fire in his grew hotter and hotter as he gazed into nothingness. Bleach stared in amazement. After a minute, Buhrne finally registered what was happening and calmed down, unclenching his fist. The fire subsided, then winked out of existence as if had never been there in the first place. Small drops of blood fell from his hand where his nails had dug into his
���� 
"Who are you?" Bleach asked breathlessly. He sat down into a nearby chair heavily as if he knees had just given out and he no longer had the will to stand. He was just lucky he hadn't fallen on the floor rather than into the chair because he hadn't checked to see if there was any available
�
���� Buhrne sat down as well, however, he did this much more casually than his guest had. "We all have our secrets. I had wanted to reveal to you some of my own, yet I never wished to completely unmask myself to you until a later time. Our mother was the Elemental of Nature, Green. I, to tell the truth, became the Elemental of Fire, Red. I was not born this way, yet earned my post. The Usurper sought to steal the essences of others in order to use in his selfish quest for glory. He had Valor, so he was not an Elf. He had no Honor, so no Dwarf could he be. Also, he didn't even have true courage, so he wasn't even a lowly Mortal Man. He was an outsider, a non-conformist, and an ambitious lout.
�
���� "I hated him. And, at first, I hated you. However, as you grew up, I became fond of you and your fascinating ways. I became your unseen protector. Davik the Old may of approved of this. He used to let me lull you to sleep when our mother was gone from home, which was very often. You thought, eventually, that I was actually the Warden of Sleep and named me Sand Man, or Zand-Mehn as you pronounced it. That honorary title I was proud to hold for five long years." Again, he was stricken with grief.
�
���� "---When our mother had perished, right?" concluded Bleach. Buhrne nodded. He paused, paying his respects to their long-gone mother, and then asked, "Brother... can I call you `Zand' once more. Or, would you prefer something else?"
�
���� Buhrne smiled. "Then let me be known as Zand forever more. The Warden and Bringer of Sleep." He laughed. They talked for almost two more hours until some one poked his head into the tent uninvited. It was Athens. He admonished Bleach for "disturbing this poor fellow" and commanded him to come back to their quarters so he could sleep for the night. 
�
���� As Bleach left, he was shocked to see that the Sun had nearly disappeared beneath the horizon. He barely managed to drag himself to their trailer and fell asleep on the floor. Athens tossed a blanket over him and set a pillow under his head so he would be more comfortable. Afterwards, he shuffled over to his bed, put his dentures in glass full of water on a bedside table, and slept as well. The hadn't bothe
�red to exchange "Good Nights." Both were too bone tired from traveling to think of such a custom.
�

III

Two hours afterward, Bleach stirred from a fitful sleep. He was still thinking over all that had happened between him and Buhrne. A poor, intelligent man who lived in a smelly tent had told him a story about a prince, a story he claimed to be about himself. No, that wasn�t quite it. Later, that man with his pointed ears and elven face had told him they were brothers. A long-forgotten apparition from his youth had coalesced into a living, breathing person. Remarkable. Then he heard it.

Bleach rolled over from his stomach onto his back. The noise that had awakened him the night before. He wasn�t sure how long ago that had been, but the knocking distracted him from his thoughts, so he was thankful for that. Athens still slept in his snoring, groaning, moaning, and cursing glory. 

Bleach smiled. This time, it was his turn to say �Hello there." 


The voice didn�t answer right away. Perhaps the knocker was disappointed for having its line stolen. Yet the next words it had spoken earlier eventually came."Well, you're a rude little boy aren't you?" The door once again was opened just a crack, bringing a small sliver of light into the room. 

"You're the one who forgot to knock," he observed again. 

The stranger laughed. The door opened wider.

"Close that door and come in. Quietly." The stranger was no longer laughing. Annoyed by his deviation from what was expected of him, the stranger closed the door with a crash, but not quite loud enough to wake the noisy old man. �Turn that lantern off." It wasn�t a request. He supposed it was enough to let one person see him in this state even though didn't really want anyone to see him. But he knew he definitely didn't want his brother to be peeking at him from the lantern's small flame. 

The lantern remained on. �Please turn off the lantern.�

"Oh, so now he says 'please'?" the voice asked. The lantern went out, but he suddenly felt a little fearful to have someone he didn't know in the darkness with him. There was a laugh in the dark. Oh no... he suddenly realized that the stranger was a woman. He had been so distracted with his thoughts that he hadn't picked up on the gender of his visitor until now. As if the strange woman were amused by his apprehension, she laughed.

"I'm sorry, Miss... I'm not sure I remember who you are... I guess I might recognize your face... but I'm not too keen on voices." 

"Perhaps you're thinking I'm a Miss Take?" she asked just as she sat on the bed. He was a little surprised by this. He hadn't even heard her walking across the floor. He couldn't help but gasp. 

"Miss take...?" 

"Haha. A little joke, sweetie. Miss Take... Mistake, like the word?" She leaned forward so that the bed creaked.

"Oh, that is pretty clever." 

"Or, it could go the other way. I'm used to taking what I want. Either that or someone takes from me." She took his hand in one of hers. She moved her hand until she had maneuvered it onto her breast. "Since you can't take a look at my face, I guess you'll have to be satisfied with trying to guess who I am by touch." 

"No, I..." She closed his mouth by putting her other hand on his mouth. She then moved her free hand from his mouth down his chin, over his neck, then down his chest. He didn't say anything, just held his breath. Her hand came down his chest to his stomach. She pinched him. As she pinched him, he used the hand she pinned against her breast to pinch her nipple. She laughed. She pinched his nipple. 

His hand on her breast was pushed down her belly, her hand on his belly moved down even further. She let go of his hand. Both his hands found her breasts. Both her hands went below his belly, slipped inside his underwear. Squeezed. �That�s how I am accustomed to saying �hello,�� the woman breathed into his ear. She got up from his bed, walked across the room in the dark, and stopped as she reached the door. �I hope we might see more of each other later� maybe next time, I�ll let you hold something of mine.� Although he couldn�t see it, he felt certain she was smiling at him over her shoulder in the dark. She opened the door, then left.

���� He learned many things from his brother's speeches and he now recycled this information and turned it around in his mind in the form of dreams. He "saw" his brother and his brother's father, Natharis the elf, as they crept silently through the Green Wood in a hunt. They hunted a boar which had gone mad from an illness of the mind which had killed many small animals and cannibalized one of its young. They pitied the animal in its misery and purposed to put it to rest. He "heard" his mother's screams from deep within the woods and Natharis and young Buhrne rushed headlong in pursuit. In a clearing, they saw the hateful deeds of the Usurper as he raped Buhrne's mother in the fashion of an ork.
���� 
So incensed with anger was Buhrne that he lit the tip of his arrow on fire with his touch and swore to smote the Interloper with it. He would have, if only Natharis had not caught the arrow before it had alighted through the air. No archer was as sure of his art as young Buhrne in his youth; he had aimed directly for the Usurper's heart and there it would of struck had his wrath been fulfilled 
But Natharis broke the arrow in half on his knee and the flames winked out before they pieces of the broken arrow struck the ground. Already, his hair had turned gray as well as his eyes and he said, "Let her do as she wishes. I have no further need of her or her false love... she has already given me a son, already." 
�
With that, he slunk into the wilderness in such a way that his true thoughts revealed that he wished that it were not.
�
No arrow did Buhrne attempt to fire at the Interloper after that, even without his father's continued intervention. Rather, he swore that a day shall come when he will avenge himself on the Interloper and his kin. ("To tell the truth,"
�
Buhrne had said that night, "I never had the chance to make good on this oath and nor do I wish I could. I don't think of you, brother, as his kin anymore. You are my younger brother and that is all you will ever be.")
���� 
In his dreams, Bleach "saw" himself and Zandegoz, the dwarf, after the game they played on the snow covered Davalcrag. We witnessed, through the eyes of their assailant, the argument they had after wards The sniper, high in tree to the south east aimed a flaming arrow at them and knocked the arrow back in his bow and pulled it taut. At this instant, Bleach had a chance to see the true face of their assailant which they hadn't been capable of seeing that faithful night of their departure. He saw... Burhne's face. Timbre stood to one side, taking no part in the act.
�
���� He heard, once more, Zand telling him of his pyrotechnic abilities and the nature of elves. "As the Elemental of Fire, I have learned many things of this world's happenings. Not only can I project my spirit into a concentrated fire of my choosing..." he held out a hand and small ember crackled into life and disappeared in a whiff of sulfur-smelling smoke. "... but they are also my eyes as well as my children. Whatever is happening in this world, as long as there is a fire nearby, I will be able to watch it occur." Bleach heard himself ask him why is it that he doesn't change form as an elf does, by willing to himself that way. Buhrne's answer was not too easily understood: "Because I have always envied mankind. This place is a world constructed from deception and tricks of slight of hand. It is called prestidigitation, much simply --- magic. Here, I can walk among men and live as they do. Without purpose, without any pretext of the strict morality which hangs over every one of my kind as an ubiquitous Sword of Damocles.

���� "When the time comes, I will leave this world as they do and secretly reincarnate myself, in the way of a Phoenix rising from its own ashes, as an entirely new person. I am an individual. Who would wish to metamorphose much easier than some change clothes throughout one's existence, unsure of which you are meant to display; when you can completely change your identity?"
�
���� As he slept, Athens tossed and turned in his bed. In his dreams, a monster terrorized him with a mechanical roar and it gleamed in the light. It's eyes were made of glass and looked like steel. He wasn't afraid of it, yet was very proud of himself for what he had wrought. What inspired fear in him was what it had done. What he said in his dreams could not be heard by either Bleach or himself. He chanted, over and over again, the words, "Tin Man, Tin Man, Tin..."

IV

The next day, Bleach found himself in the variety tent.� 

The kaleidoscopic melody of an eccentric composer's symphony wafted through the air with a remarkable puissance. The haughty fellow sat back in his chair before the gaily painted piano, hands clasped behind his head as he played with his feet. His unshod toes danced dextrously across the keys and a maddening pace. The diminutive maestro beamed brightly smiled broadly as his audience first gaped in amazement and then cheered and applauded his performance. For an encore, he dove forward as he brought his feet down to the floor and began to play almost as well with his hands as he did with his feet.� Then, he did a hand-stand, the coat tails of his snappy green suit hang down over his shoulders, and continued to play while his feet pointed straight up. He finished with somersault onto the top of his piano and bowed extravagantly.
�
���� The M.C. dismissed him with the words, "How bout a final round of applause for Danny Boy; the Leprechaun." The leprechaun bowed once more and cart-wheeled off-stage. A curtain was lifted, revealing mock-up of a beach, with the horizon painted flatly onto a back drop. An actor who wore a sailor's outfit came on-stage from the left and he carried a large umbrella. He unfurled it and stuck the end of it into the sand. He sat beneath the umbrella and then laid himself down for a nap. As he slept, a woman's head popped up from behind some rocks off to the edge of the shore. She had long, blond hair and a beautiful face with blue eyes. Her head disappeared beneath the rocks and reappeared a few feet closer to where the sailor slept. She laughed.
�
���� When she was just parallel of him, she raised herself up so that her body, from the waist up, was visible. Bleach was surprised to see she wasn't wearing any clothes at all and began to blush. Her hair, even though it was wet, hung loosely down her shoulders and away from her face in way which lead one to believe that it were perfectly dry. From what Bleach could see of her, she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. She reminded him of the way Amy had looked so long ago. Her eyes, although a different color than those of the elven woman's, they had the same intelligence about them. She smiled with full lips and perfectly white teeth which gleamed slightly in the light. She dove below and a fish tail came up and splashed some water into the sailor's
�
���� He awoke with a start and looked all around to see who had disturbed his sleep. The woman appeared once more, this time at the edge of the rocks. She smiled and beckoned to him before diving below. He stood up fast, knocking the umbrella over in his haste. He flung his shirt and shoes off as he ran toward the rocks. Reaching the end, he dove in after her. 
�
���� A minute later, he surfaced and splashed about, searching for her with alarm. One of her hands broke the surface about ten feet away from him. The hand waved, then went below once more. He swam to where she had been. After looking about to no avail, he dived underwater to see if he could find her. He surfaced in the same spot, gulped up a mouthful of air, then went below again. When he surfaced for a second time, he began to gasp, already starting to get exhausted.
�
���� A single, enchanting note of a siren's caught in the air and he spun about to see her lying face down on a smooth rock near the beach. She waved to him extravagantly and her bosoms swayed and glistened wetly in the light.� He swam along the surface in a rough, torturous stroke which disturbed the water a great deal. Just before he could reach her, she disappeared behind the rock and he could only see a ripple in the water which marked her passage.

���� He stood, dripping wet, wearing only a pair sodden pants which clung to his legs. The pockets were full of water and bulged out at his sides. He clasped his hands to his lips and called for her. She then reappeared, far out in the bay. She laughed and waved again. This time she sang a full verse of her song, which was a wordless jungle of sounds which were pleasant to the ear. He dived back into the water and began to swim toward her at a feverish pace as soon as he hit the surface. Once again, just before he reached her, she disappeared. He stopped right in his tracks and moaned with all of the sorrow in his heart. Just then, she shot out of the water and flew up and over his head in wide arc, almost five feet up and three to the side.

���� For the first time, her entire body was revealed. From the waist up, she was a beautiful woman, yet, instead of legs, she had a fish's tail with emerald-colored scales like the plates in a knights armor and a fin on the end. She even had a short dorsal fin growing out of her back. Surprised, the hapless sailor reached for her, yet her body passed right past his groping hands. After she went under, the mermaid rose up right next to the sailor and they embraced. She kissed him, her breasts crushed against his broad chest. She undid his pants and they made love in the sea. 

They flopped around and around on their sides in the water like a cap-sized in a bizarre flurry of naked flesh. Still kissing, they sunk beneath the surface. The surface of the water was disrupted with many bubbles.

���� Almost five minutes later, the mermaid swam to the beach and dragged the naked body of the drowned sailor onto the sand. She kissed his cold, blue lips once more and dove underwater. The curtain fell. The air was permeated in exhalation by all of the menfolk present, sighs in regret to no longer be capable of seeing this human oddity, as well as in relief in having not taken the place of her unfortunate victim. In deed, many amongst them were sailors themselves, all the more seduced by her wily charms than less hardier souls.


���� As was his custom, the gregarious young Bleach spoke with the young actress who had performed in said sideshow. Actually, he had been speechless. He had been dining in with Buhrne, discussing the past times they had shared. At a sudden, there was a rustling at the curtained threshold. A figure crawled along the floor, dragging itself with two highly muscular front limbs. It's true shape was obscured by the lack illumination in that area of tent. It was well nigh an hour or two from nightfall, but dark clouds covered the rays of the sun from reaching the earth. To keep his brother buoyant and alert enough to converse with, Buhrne had obligingly transplanted all of the candles in a circle on the dirt floor which surrounded the chair in which Bleach sat.
���� 
A chill draft seemed to creep up the young child's spine as he sat aghast with a foreboding of death beating monotonously in his small heart. Not in fear of his own safety, but that of another which had already occurred. Irrationally, he thought that the dead soldier, the man whom he buried with the token of Friend on his tombstone, had somehow crawled out of the grave to seek vengeance on him. The anomaly oozed across the dirt floor and into the circle of light. It reached a groping hand out to him, caked in mud, and he fell backward in his chair in fear. Too late, he noticed that hand was slender and long nailed rather than the skeletal claw of a zombie. The back of his head thudded on the ground and he realized that he had knocked over several candles and his hair had caught on fire.

���� He screamed and dashed past what he realized was the mermaid who had come to visit them, like a fish out of water. As he ducked through the entrance in his rush to extinguish his flaming hair, the tent itself caught on fire. Not more than ten paces away was water trough to slake the first of a dehydrated animal and he dunked his head into it without pause. So embarrassed was he that rather than turn his attention to the burning tent, he sulked out, his cheeks burning painfully with a blush.
���� 
He came to the outside, beyond the perimeter of the fence, to the very front of the Circus lot. The throng of spectators waiting patiently to behold the wonders was as crowded as always. The fat barker even smiled a ponderous smile at him with his saggy, bull-dog face of his. At the very back, he noticed a commotion occurring

���� The crowds parted, their places in line, in which they had patiently waited for perhaps hours on end, were forgotten in their mass revulsion for the horrible sight which they saw approaching them. A broken and pathetic man sat in the saddle of a starved horse, swaying lifelessly as the horse walked. Pale horse with even paler rider, he stank of death; that is, of stagnant earth from the depths of a graveyard. He looked like the embodiment of death unhooded and astride a dying horse. His face was torn off and bloodied, revealing his skull from his forehead to the hollows of his eyes. In deed, his eyes were plastered shut from dried blood and he was effectively blind. He wore a soldier's clothes which were a little too big for him or he had simply wasted away from starvation along the long road he had traveled. His legs were bandaged in several places and one arm had been broken; it was held across his chest in a crude sling. His hair was shaped in unflattering arrangements and he bled from a wound on the crown of his head, which was also bandaged.

���� The most absurd thing about him, had it been a laughing matter, was the way he steered his horse; in his hand he held a stick and on the opposite end of the stick hung a carrot, dangling before the poor beast's snout. He fell from the saddle rather than dismount as the carrot and stick was released from his grasp. The horse gobbled up its prize and shuffled about four feet from him and fell dead on the floor, bereft of all strength it had once had. Some hearty men came over and carried him onto a bench outside of the gate. The fat barker told one of the women to get something called a "first aid kit" and she ran off. He let the man drink from a flask of brandy, "free of charge," and the wounded soldier was grateful. He spoke of long voyage he had taken and how tired he was. He complained a little of his pains, but was not really cognizant of how badly he was injured. He said that if he was to die this day, he had only one more request to make; "I always wanted to be with a beautiful woman. Could some kindly lady grant a kiss to a dying man?"
���� 
A homely young maid, by no means could she ever be considered anything more than mildly pretty, approached and kissed him shyly on the lips. He thanked her and she blushed as she returned to the crowd. Already, they all thought of this man as a hero.

���� Someone asked him from where did he come? He sobbed. The woman who had gone to retrieve the first aid kit returned and began to remove his old bandage and redress and clean his wounds. He opened his mouth and spoke in a voice completely without mirth. "From a place that is no more," he said. "A city which stood upon the zenith of the world but is now wading in the middle of a canker of woe." 

���� The bloody man's vivid description sent shock and fear coursing through Bleach's veins. He felt a hand clasp his shoulder and he cried out a curse in surprise. The bloody man heard the cry and his head shot up and his eyes popped open suddenly. He cried out as soon as he laid eyes on Bleach and pointed him out to the crowd. As he fell off the bench. He died of a heart attack as soon as he hit the ground. His last words had been, "It's the WITCH!"
���� 
However, the crowd was confused at first because of what stood behind Bleach: Burhne, covered in ashes with the mermaid, looking a lot worse for wear, clutched in his arms like a newlywed bride. In all of the excitement, Bleach had forgotten about the fire in the tent which he had escaped not too long ago. He took a step forward before a mob overtook him, snatched the mermaid from his arms, and threw him to the ground restrained by many rough hands. As nearly two dozen people held him down, a beefy man squatted over him and punched him out cold. Then, four men, each holding a hand or foot, and a fifth who pulled at his hair, carried his prone body off. Bleach could only follow from behind the unruly mob.

�� They carried him to his performance stage and tossed him unceremoniously into the pit. They poured two bucket fulls off water in there to arose him and flung his girlfriend, stripped naked of her clothing, into his arms. He managed to catch her, almost too late. The women who stared down at them spat and cursed them, a few of the men even pulled their trousers down and urinated on the heads of the surprised pair. A cartload of horse dung was backed into the tent and its contents was dumped into the pit. The chamber reeked

���� Bleach broke from the crowd and ran with the speed of a wraith across the fairgrounds and found Kristofur sleeping against a tree with his hands folded on his lap. Bleach roused him and screamed a frantic explanation of the events occurred, yet a crowd had broken off from the main procession and followed him. They tied Kristofur, who sat whimpering on the ground, as innocent as a puppy, despite the strength which he possessed. As it turned out, Joe McDonald was one of the radicals and he recognized Bleach at first sight and immediately dove at him out of desperation. Bleach hopped over him and ran off, leaving the lot of them in his wake.

���� 
He returned two hours later, crawling up a hill which overlooked one corner of the complex from above the fence line. At top was old deserted shack. He stared out the window just in time to see a procession of hooded men. In their midst, he saw his brother, the mermaid, Kristofur, and two others; all tied in a spider web-like knot of ropes, intersecting in a metal ring. The hooded men carried torches in mockery of the noon day sun. Theirs was a dark deed, best not illuminated by the hallowed glow to assuage the rage which filled their hearts. They wanted, yet did not wish, only to see their enemies by the light of which had come forth from their own hands in the form of pagan fire... not from a blessed mystery.

���� All of this, of course would be no sweat for Bleach's brother, the elemental of fire, only if he were not tied up at the moment. He could only squirm in his binds futiley as he saw, from the eyes of each flaming, mute tongue and from his own eyes, his upcoming demise. The faces throng was overrun with be-sheeted clansmen. The air reeked of some devilish ceremony; a judgment set to pass. Bleach himself was only too familiar with persecution. The crowd waited, chanting some hideous tongue which Bleach did not know, but only feared. They all stared at the setting sun as it shone with its last, dying rays of light. There they saw the sweetness of mercy, to rebuke their actions and let their prisoners go. A few even murmured dissent.

���� Above the now hesitant murmur, a cruel, grumbling voice was heard. The owner of the voice cleared his throat, a sound which resembled the clash of a thousand swords upon a thousand shields "Enough! Gahrg!" The torches' light revealed only a portion of the speaker's countenance Red-pupiled eyes, fang-like teeth, and a crooked ear. The speaker was ugly, to say the least. In his hands, he held an incredible weapon, which literally roared to life as he pulled its trigger.

���� He swept the barrel of the weapon in several arcs, from the left to right, flames spewing forth about him along with smoke. A couple dozen or more people fell dead in a heap, blood saturating their white robes. The rest of them, rather than avenge their fallen comrades or flee in terror, were only shocked. 

The intruder walked into their midst and only then was his face fully revealed. Infectious, gangrenous scars abound, a missing eye, a toad's be-spotted skin. The last rays of the sun nearly vanished. "Valvarikt Kwinsitavk!" he shouted. They repeated it in a clamorous voice as hundred tongues spoke the same words at the same time.
���� 
Up above, in the battlements of a castle which they all cavorted around, a humongous, boiling cauldron was suddenly revealed by the fire beneath it. 

Or, perhaps, it was just that Bleach had been transfixed upon the crowd, the stranger, and the prisoners. Crazily, he thought that they had meant to cannibalize their unfortunate victims. 

However, two executioners, who stirred the pot with metal rods, began, ludicrously, to rip open pillows and drop the feathers into the boiling pot. The chant was repeated, along with the new verse supplied by the stranger, who now seemed to be welcomed by all but Bleach and his friends. When the contents of the cauldron were at its hottest and the stirring rods began to melt, the executioners began to tip over the contents. Most importantly, the sun had set. Bleach glimpsed molten tar as it was sluiced into a culvert at the rim of the battlements. From then on, the next few moments seemed to crawl by in slow motion.

���� Bleach, finally recalled his lessons in magic and almost instinctively whistled the elven chime for wind and waved his arm in the air. The bound prisoners gaped in fear and screamed soundlessly. The crowd reveled in savage pleasures. The falling rain of tar and feathers was diverted by a sudden gust of wind as it fell and came to earth on the heads of the unsuspecting throng of heathens. The stuff caught afire from contact with the torches and the smell of cremating flesh sickened Bleach. He pitied them, even after witnessing what they had intended to do to his friends. He ran down the other side of the hill and stumbled onto an archer's quiver and bow. He fired the arrow at the rope from which they all hung and it was cleft. They all floated, rather than fell to safety, thanks to his skills. Kristofur broke from his binds and assisted the others promptly. The six of them escaped, Buhrne carrying his girlfriend in his arms as before.

���� 
They ran into the wake of the setting sun, leaving an inferno, fueled this time by man's greed and indomitable search for purification. The fire burned, indiscriminate in whom perished as it propelled itself toward mass destruction, and ultimately rebirth. Fortunately, all it encountered was pure evil. Kindling of hollow scarecrows set out to terrify flighting vermin with their straw-brained ignorance. Strangely, although gifted with his fire-sight, Buhrne smiled. Could it be he himself stoked those flames and kept them on the rampage?

���� Bleach himself, running as fast as his virile legs could carry him, was fading fast. Adrenaline and panic had aided him by keeping him awake long enough to free his comrades from a fate worse than as well as humiliating and torturous. When the hit the road where it intersected their headlong path, he could not continue any further. He halted, sank to his knees, and fell asleep with his chin landing smack dab onto the stones.

���������������� 
Buhrne was afraid. His instincts told him to keep on the move, to run among the wild things. To speak with them and reconnoiter They told him that he wasn't safe yet. It wouldn't be long before the pandemonium broke down long enough for some one to realize they had escaped and would form a lynch mob to search them out. He was just too damn close, only three-quarters of a mile outside of the pavilion. Yet, his heart told him something different. He reasoned that at least one person back there had been a friend amongst all of those charlatans, a true friend who would also be on a look out for them, and he was just about to show up.

���� So that's how it happened, after skirting the road for some time and then dashing frantically across when the cost was clear, that he finally met Athens Ford after several hours of clandestine escape. In the darkness of night, he had struck only a lone match to light the way and, by virtue of his gift, it never went out. They walked through tall grass which went all of the way up to their knees and wallowed through muddy morasses while they weren't walking on the stony road. If they must tred upon it, they raced laterally across in single file while Buhrne held the rear. He carried Bleach in arms while Alcyone clung to his waist. She swept the ground with her tail to displace their tracks in the dust.

���� After some time, they were crossing the road once more when Athens in his incredible contraption came hurtling towards them from out of nowhere. At the time, every one else was either standing on one side of the road or the other, yet big Kristofur was in the middle of crossing it. Kristofur just stood his ground and held his huge arms up in front of him to protect his head.

���� The cow catcher on the front of the Marvelous Machine crashed directly into him, and the force of the impact crumpled the contraption like a tin can. Athens flew out of the driver's seat and fell safely into Kristofur's waiting arms, who had come out of the ordeal with barely a scratch.

However, the same could not be said for the intrepid eccentric's invention: it was a complete and total wreck. A wheel fell off and rolled a few down the road before stopping on its side.

���� Athens was absolutely miserable. He wrestled himself from the gentle giant's grip and stalked about the scene of the accident and surveyed the damage with a cynical eye. From its niche beneath the seat, he unsheathed a rattan cane and advanced on Kristofur with the sole purpose of beating the daylights out of him with it. Even as he raised up to swing the first blow, it suddenly became too hot to his touch and he dropped it on the ground with a curse. When the cane hit the floor, it sparked and caught fire. Buhrne stepped into the glow of the light and stood his ground between the irate Athens Ford and the cowering Kristofur. "Who are you?" he asked.

���� In the glow of his burning cane, Athens laid eyes on the slumbering child cradled in the arms of a stranger and his jaw hung open stupidly for a few moments. Then he doubled up into himself, hands upon knees, and laughed with insane glee.

Tears began squirting from his eyes. He easily circumvented Buhrne with the bustle of a five-year-old and he was effervescent with charm as he apologized whole-heatedly to Kristofur for his aches and pains caused by his careless behavior, yet the "ruckus" he was fleeing from was one party he'd rather not be in attendance at. He introduced himself to one and all, then took his cap off and held it against his heart in mourning as addressed the issue of his now kaput Marvelous Machine.

���� After-wards, he combed through the wreckage until he found a bottle of wine he'd saved for "a special occasion; N', boy howdy, ain't this a very special one in deed?" 

Unfortunately, he only had single tin cup from which to offer out the vittles with and for this, he was embarrassed. As each drank from the cup, one at a time, he produced from a pocket in his vest a vial containing an opaque, white powder. Its texture appeared to the untrained eye both smooth and grainy. Athens put a finger in his mouth, wet it with saliva, poked the finger in the vial, then stuck his finger in his nose. He snorted it, wiped the excess powder off on his trouser leg, then put the vial back in his pocket without bothering to offer some to anyone else. Buhrne looked into the man's eyes and he didn't like what he saw. Whatever it had been, it appeared to affect the man's mind in some harmful way.

���� He pranced about, hollering out cordiality to each of his companions. At one time he even slipped in a mud puddle and clambered out, filthy, with several obscenities ripe on his lips. Buhrne restrained him while the others found a rope to tie his hands behind his back and furnish a leash.

However, rather than neutralize the threat he posed to their clandestine retreat, it only intensified his callousness. He began to run about and butt people with his head and shoulders or tangled the leash about his wardens' legs by running around them until they trip and fell in the gloom. Once, he even bit Kristofur on the nose and the poor fellow screamed and shuffled off, the dentures locked shut with a
pit-bull's tenacious grip.

���� Buhrne tackled him and they both stumbled into a patch of dirt which collapsed beneath their weight and they fell in a gaping pit. From the pit, Buhrne stared up at his surprised cohorts and called for them to fetch some more rope to hoist him out with. That was when a sparkle in the distance caught his eye. He glanced at it then walked across the earthy floor until he found what he'd seen. It appeared to be a precious gem of some kind. When he raised his head to report what he'd found, he noticed that he passed further beneath the ground.

He stared forward and could not determine where it all ended. That's when he figured out where he was. A tunnel. When he returned to the hole, he saw that they had just helped Athens out of the pit and were waiting on him. 

���� He called out that he had changed his mind and wanted everyone to join him in the pit. At the first, they were all thunderstruck by this ridiculous notion, yet he explained to them finally that he believed they actually had stumbled into an abandoned mine shaft and showed them the gem he found.
���� 
In the next half hour, they all set about recovering all of the supplies and wreckage of the Mystery Machine and tossed it into the pit. Buhrne lit a dozen torches and they stuck diagnoally into the earthen walls as they worked. When they finished, at his advice, they booby trapped the entrance by putting spikes on the floor. They also collapsed that portion of the tunnel so none would follow. When they couldn't figure out where to precede to, Athens produced a compass and suggested they go north west.

���� He had calmed down considerably since his lunatic episode of a few moments hence. He shrugged it all off of his conscience, as if it had not happened. Athens consulted the compass once more, nodded. "We should continue further... NW along this passage here, then, when we reach an intersection, we should precede in a direction heading NE."

���� "Are you absolutely sure?" Alcyone wanted to know. So did Buhrne, but he'd rather not go to the trouble of asking. He now wore a cloak made from a tarp which he had found inside the MM and a piece of string served as a clasp.

���� "My dear lady, nothing is absolute. All of the things you have told in your life, which undoubtedly have been referred to as an 'absolute' principle is nothing more than absolutely wrong or absolutely boring!! I believe in science. I acquire scientific knowledge, then I apply it with technology. Witchcraft is superstition. Superstition is poppy-cock! Besides, we can't go straight the other way because we just closed off any chance of going back!!! 'The grass is always greener,' and 'there is always a silver lining on every cloud.'" With that, he marched forward without another word.

���� They trudged on. A crack of lightning was heard. It could only mean that it had begun to rain. This point was further punctuated by a sudden flood which had at first drenched their ankles and was then getting far deeper every second. Their morale was down. People complained, yet Athens continued to shout that he was right. He was right! They were all running point ahead of some major disaster. The water was freezing cold and their teeth began to chatter everyone was miserable.

���� Athens had a solution. He instructed Buhrne to set fire the roots of tree which had punctured through the earth into the tunnel they were following. Buhrne insisted the idea was pointless, yet his comments fell on deaf ears. He did as he was asked, and the fire would he not catch. As he'd said, the roots were too soggy to be of any use as firewood. Then, Athens withdrew the near-empty bottle of wine from his pack. He sloshed down the rest. From another pocket, he took out a can which contained a flammable, inky liquid and poured that into the empty bole. He tore a strip of his shirt off and stuffed some of that in the bottle. "Now," when I throw this at those roots, you light 'er up. Remember, the instant the bottle breaks, you roast it, okay? One the count of three: One, Two, Three!!" He tossed the Molotov cocktail and the wet roots were immediately burning.

���� "Now!" Athens repeated himself, "Now, we run like heck! Go! Go! Go!" They did as they asked. Just as the last person had run a full fifteen feet from the roots, a tree came tumbling over and crashed through the ceiling. It had fallen the opposite way that they were heading and was still on fire. When the tree had fallen, a blood-curdling scream was heard. But nobody saw any one of their number get injured in the explosion. So, that meant they were probably being followed. They were heartened by this awareness which was evinced in Athen's character because he had been prudent enough to expect someone had been trailing them, despite their precautions.

���� They came to an intersection before much time had passed. It was actually a large room, octagonal shaped, and with walls made from carved stone. It's heigth and depth was almost as great as the length of tunnel they had just traversed. Honey-combed all along each wall, at varying positions, the mouths of tunnels similar to the one they been traversing.� From each opening, a great quantity of fresh rain water was collected in this reservoir. Athens was quick to explain that this "tunnel" actually was a sewage line, meant to provide drinking water to a nearby community of dwarves. However, he admonished, he doubted very much that any dwarves lived here anymore. No one protested. They were all too busy clinging to walls, in an effort to keep from being swept away.

Athens carefully waded to edge of the tunnel and peered upward. He called back for "My Good Friend, Mr. Colossus," to help him out of "jam." Buhrne tapped Kristofur on the shoulder and motioned for him to go see Athens.

Athens stood pondering for a moment as Kristofur stood patiently waiting for instructions. Athens stood nearly motionless, staring at Kristofur�s arm or chest or his elbow, then turning to look up into the vertical well. A child lost his balance and would have been swept out over the edge if Kristofur hadn�t had caught him. The boy said his thanks and stalked back to his mother and sister. The sister whispered to him that only Kristofur read upon her lips and no one else heard besides the boy: �So I wasn't the one who made him slip, right?� He smiled. Athens glanced in the direction of the children disapprovingly and then suddenly cursed and kicked the wall quite hard. �Blast it!� Athens muttered. �Um, I don�t suppose we�ve counted at any time?�

�Counted?� asked Buhrne.

�Counted ourselves�Y�know� when ya�ll got away from that bruhah� when we met on the road� when we got into this tunnel� when we got here to this point? How many of us?� Athens wanted to know.

�We didn�t. You�re right,� replied Buhrne. �We hadn�t thought of it. Don�t worry, it isn�t your fault��

�I wasn�t volunteering to be given any blame and I�m also not worried,� corrected Athens. �Just mildly curious.�

�Whatever. Anyway, I don�t believe we can count right now in this dark�� mused Buhrne. �Just figure out how to get us out of here and we can get to the surface.� 

�I think we should count now!� insisted Alcyone. 

�I understand your reason for why, but we can�t now. If you think we should count, you can count for us,� Athens said. He turned Kristofur to face him and begin to pantomime his plans to him. 

�Oh? Is it because I�m a woman, is it?� Alycone presisted. �Well, I would, but I can�t� at least not very well past ten� I�d count up to twenty if I had toes� but I haven�t� or is it because I haven�t got feet is why you�re relegating me to counter, is it? Well, I can swim much better than you leggy folk, so there!� she said, splashing her tail and flicking a gout of water at Athen�s back. He paid her no attention. Buhrne gave her a stern look and she subsided. 

Athens turned and called for a rope and after some discussion, one was produced. He tied a loop into the end of the rope and in this loop placed a stone and tightened the knot. Then, he threw the end of the rope underhanded so that it arced up and back so that the stone landed on the stone parapet just above their heads. �So now we know we can do that�� He reeled the rope back and gathered it up around his shoulder neatly. �Matches.� A book of them was produced as before. He struck one, turned to acknowledge Buhrne, glanced at the match in his hand, then to Buhrne, and back to the match. Buhrne nodded. Athens held the match out to arm's length until it burned completely out. Then he struck another and dropped it straight down the shaft. The next one he threw across to the left. The next to the right. The third straight up. �Have you seen anything of use to us?�

�There is a ladder.� Buhrne pointed across to the opposite end of the shaft. �Problem is we have to get over there.� 

�Do you suppose it can be jumped?� wondered Athens. 

�Are you insane?� Buhrne said, sounding exasperated. 

�Obviously I am. Why do you ask?� mused Athens.

�You are?� asked Buhrne.

�Why else would I be here, helping you rather being part of that mob?� Athens wanted to know. 

�Because doing this, being here is the right thing,� Buhrne put in.
�The right thing? Perhaps you are more insane than I am,� Athens insisted, spreading his hands out at his sides. He continued before a reply could come. �I hardly believe endangering my life so recklessly and putting myself at great risk is �right� at all.� He then pointed a finger across the gap. �Anyhow. Can it be jumped?�

�It would be too far. You couldn�t have been asking in all seriousness�� Buhrne trailed off.

�I WASN�T. Just an option to be explored. Next, could we perhaps throw something across?�

�We haven�t got a grappling hook with us and we may not fashion one well enough to be used in this predicament,� said Buhrne.

�Perhaps if we tossed a person across?� Athens asked.
�I would rather not,� said Buhrne.

�Could someone perhaps crawl along the wall to the right or left to one of the openings to the side?� Athens asked.

�Good suggestion, but who?� Burhne asked.

�Our strong fellow perhaps?� Athens answered with a question of his own." 
"Can he actually do this?" Buhrne asked.

�I suggest we ask him,� Athens said.

They nodded at each other. Athens quickly showed Kristofur what he wanted him to do. Kristofur signed his agreement. They tied the rope around his waist and sent him towards the opening. He made good progress and was over there almost within a few seconds. After a rest, he began towards the opposite opening from Buhrne. 

It was on this trip he slipped and would of fallen if he hadn�t of caught onto the ladder. He tied the rope to here and Buhrne held tight onto his end along with the help of two other men. Each of the others made their way across the rope by using their hands and crossing their feet over the top while their backs hung down. 

In this way, each person shimmied across facing up rather than down. Almost two dozen made their way across in this way. But an exact number couldn�t be determined because only Bleach or Buhrne alone were capable counting above ten. Buhrne was too busy squinting from the effort it to took hold the rope steady� Bleach� well�. He was asleep again. 

Alcyone forsake the rope completely. She made a point of climbing hand-over-hand across the shaft, even using her tail to balance herself, to cross within seconds without the merest of pauses. She then climbed straight up the ladder as quick as a shot and came back down almost immediately. �Oh, and thanks for asking me!� She shouted back to her fuming lover. �Well, there�s a roof, but it doesn�t appear to be locked.�

�Describe it,� Athens said.

�Well, my not having legs must somehow affect my vision. But� even my poor legless freak self can see that it�s a metal door� round�. with a wheel that you turn to open the door. It goes up, but I didn�t check to see what is on the other side.�

�Why not?� asked Athens.

�I can�t use my arms to open it and hold onto the ladder at the same time� that�s the only disadvantage to having a tail.� Alcyone explained sheepishly. 

�I can�t tell if you envy us or feel we should envy you,� Athens mused. 
She had no reply to this. She might even have been tempted to say he was right on both cases. Sometimes one, sometimes the other, but she wasn�t going to tell an old bastard like him that in the middle of a dank tunnel. Well, this is probably a first, she thought. Here I am, traipsing around in a giant vagina. Funnier still, the last time he�s been in one hopefully was when he was born. I hope his mother pissed on his face when he came out of her. She laughed at him. 

�Oh, I know what you�re thinking. Mildred feels I�m pretty good company. She�s eaten a lot of fish in her life. She�s also eaten women while they were still alive and breathing; much to their pleasure she admits. Y�know, the ones that haven�t got gills and have a hoohoo betwixt their legs. Have you even got a hoohoo? Where do you keep it? In a box in your purse?� Athens commented. 

Alycone�s complete shock at him throwing her own thoughts back into her face was very evident. �Okay, so maybe I went a little far there. I�m sorry.� 

�You shouldn�t be!� spoke up the woman in the red dress, who apparently was named Mildred.

�Don�t worry, lassie, They�re just polite little noise people make. I don�t genuinely feel contrition,� Athens explained. �So, anyway, fishgirl, why is it you hadn�t counted earlier?� 

�Because I don�t know how,� commented Alcyone �No, stop. Don�t judge me so soon. Most of us don�t. Officially, only Mr. Wright�� 

�His name should be Mr. Wrong. Sorry. Please continue.�
She laughed in-spite of herself. �You�re right. You should be Mr. Right. Well� not that you�re right all the time� well, let�s not get into that. Mr. Wrong was the only one allowed to count anything. He wouldn�t even let us count the money he paid us for what we did for him. We�d have tabs at all the merchants around. You�d pick up what you wanted to buy, show them your card which showed that you worked for the circus on it, and say �put it on my tab.� The merchants weren�t allowed to tell you how much what you were buying cost.�
�I imagine that he had some pretty harsh punishments for transgression,� Athens wanted to know.
�Um. Trans�? Well, anyway, punishments? Sure. He�d stab your eyes out. And if you tried counting with your fingers, he�d cut those off, too. Same punishment for reading. When you were hired, he�d have a dozen of his goons in his office. He�d write your name down on a piece of paper, he�d ask if you wanted to work for him, you�d say �yes� and the goons would witness you agreeing to work for him.�
�Anything special about these goons?� Athens asked.
�They all wore hoods. And one of them had a shaved head.� Alcyone said. Bleach stirred a little in his sleep. He was hardly noticed. She continued, �And if anyone asked to read his contract, well, they woke up on the side of a ditch somewhere with two broken legs.�
�Two broken legs?� Athens asked.
�So they couldn�t walk away, you see,� Alcyone said. She was getting used to talking to him despite his misbehavior earlier. 
�I suppose if you had asked to see yours, he�d break your arms?� Athens joked.
This time she did laugh genuinely. �Right. Not that I would give a cause to do so. I can�t read or write. Well, I know how to write PLEASE and HUG and ME. Usually I write them all together.�
�Will you stop asking him to hug you and let me come across already!� shouted Buhrne. Everyone laughed at this. He scooped up Bleach off of the floor, put the sleeping child�s arms around his neck, hooked one arm around to cradle him to his chest, and held the rope clenched in both hands. He took a running leap, and landed squarely on the floor on the opposite side, completely crossing the gap with plenty of room to spare. �Oh, and thanks for asking me to jump across earlier. We�re all so impressed with both of your climbing skills and the old buzzard�s prattling nonsense.�
�Sarcasm would be the death of this poor old man,� lamented Athens. �What�s that?� he said, pointing to the side where they�d just come from. They saw the light of a torch coming around the corner. Before they could see who it was, everyone had run away down the corridor as soundlessly as they could. 
The hand holding the torch ended at a bracelet at the wrist made of dull plated of metal. The wrist guard came to the elbow. The elbow terminated into a shoulder covered in more metal. The arm itself was the length of that of a child�s, but it was incredibly muscled from exercise and was very powerful-looking. The shoulder was attached to a torso wrapped in heavy chain mail that sparkled in the light of the torch. Buhrne could have seen the face of the person holding the torch, but he had not at the time wished to do so. He was too busy grousing over what he felt was the flirtation between the old goat and his girlfriend. 
They met a channel which emptied out into an-above ground lake. Daylight had come, as seemed to them, at-last. However, they had no way of knowing what the time of day was exactly just past noon, yet, for them, it was a welcome sight after spending a night in a sewer. At this time, as well as you can imagine, sleeping beauty awoke from the singular kiss of a beautiful sunshine. He was perplexed by his soiled cohorts and the blood which had dried to his cheek like a scaly second skin. He vaguely recalled stumbling in the dark, fleeing from some unknowable terror beyond his capacity of imagination. He was surprised also by inexplicable manifestation of Athens Ford, reeking of shit and sodden in some horrible mess. His beard was brown with grime, his feet bare. Bleach suspected that they were on the lamb.

���� Buhrne set his brother down in a thicket of reeds and assisted the others in a similar fashion. Bleach rubbed his eyes, blinked, then seemed to become satisfied that he wasn't hallucinating. "Is it safe here, do you think?" he whispered cautiously. Athens put a hand to his pursed lips and raised his index finger, telling him to be quiet, and pointed. Bleach saw a vague shadow in the horizon, standing above the waterline. His heart quelled with fear and he hid amongst the grass.

���� As far as they could tell, the stranger was alone. He was standing at-ease, and raised his hand to his mouth as if to cough. Instead, a puff of smoke drifted from his lips. Buhrne had a sudden realization and tuned in on his second-sight. He closed his eyes, concentrated on the small flicker of flame, and pressed his second and third fingers of each hand on either his temples. In the next moment, he was seeing along a cylinder of rolled paper which contained a quantity of tobacco. The face of the smoker was a grotesque visage to say the least. 

Stupid, mulish eyes; a swinish snout of a nose; and fangs. Otherwise, it was lump of gray or semi-turquoise flesh meshed with a multitude of scars. An ugly brute. Buhrne perceived that what he was seeing was perhaps dead, yet unquestionably a viable entity. He "heard" a voice rebuke the lollygagger and the brute extinguished with a curse. Buhrne opened his eyes. The interloper apparently was on guard, yet did not take his duty fairly seriously. He stood at attention, clicking his heels, and his posture improved slightly; his hands held his weapon rigidly against his chest.

���� Five minuets passed, when his superior had left, the guard made an impolite gesture. He lit another match. Buhrne willed it to extinguish itself. The soldier's back was turned to them. Buhrne stooped over and motioned for Alcyone to swim over and accost the creature. She crawled into the water and submerged stealthily. A second match was struck, the guard began to turn about, and the match suddenly burned the tips of his fingers before it went out. The guard cursed. He was fifty or sixty feet off, a yard above the waterline. 

Buhrne was not concerned for Alycone's safety. It was her element, she could breathe underwater with the aide of gills as well as she could on dry land. He could see a wave in the still water which signified her passage through it. She was half-way there.

���� A third match bit the dust. The interloper's attention began to wander once again. This time, the match suddenly sparked into life and he re-lit his used cigarette. A tense moment passed. Alcyone surfaced without a splash. She signaled to Buhrne that she was fine. She sang a siren's song which was pleasant to the heart. The guard abruptly finished smoking and spun around and aimed his weapon. He walked to the shore line, visibly relaxed, and bent to scrutinize her face. She suddenly swept his legs out from under him and pulled his head down. The brute stumbled into the water and her arms were about its neck in a savage embrace. The poor beast sputtered, then fell silent. She released her hold and the guard's body floated momentarily. She had snapped its neck in an instant, thought Buhrne with horror. He realized for the first time how romanticized the old tales were.
�
����� They disposed of the body and rationed out the provisions it had possessed amongst themselves. Most of the food was rotted and ill preserved. The soldiers' weapon posed a disagreements and Athens confiscated it --- because of "professional curiosity," and nothing more. Alcyone was sent on reconnaissance while the others set about on rotating shifts throughout the night. During the day, there was nothing of value to report. They saw no sign of the interloper's brethren. He obviously was of a lower rank than the other ork and it was unlikely that an officer would bother to travel abroad with only one soldier to accompany him. (It was soon ascertained that what they just seen was an ork.) Only Buhrne and Alcyone alone had seen the creature up-close. What had alarmed them most was not the brute's surly disposition, but the muscle tone it had in the chest and arms. Clearly, the ork had possessed incredible strength, yet not an ounce of intelligence.
�
�
���� They wandered in broad day light furtively, with more caution than they'd had during the last night. Whoever, or whatever, was on their track, would find it much simpler to spot them in the brightness of sunlight. That night, they had passed by several camps of the cloaked citizenry, bivouacking on the outskirts of town. The men, some of whom had removed their hoods --- for it was a warm night --- and wiped sweat from their surly brows, had the attitude of guardians rather than the search parties which had been expected by the fugitives.� Each camp was located along a curved line, equidistant from each other with about a quarter mile between.
�
���� As they passed, Buhrne commanded the campfires to dim so that they would be unnoticed by a chance observer. The men spoke harshly and with fearful superstition toward the shape of the moon or the contemplative silence outside of their line of site. When the fire closed in on itself, they cowered together and a shuffled closer to the ebbing light. When the fugitives had passed stealthily by them, they laughed at their own actions in the newly re-born fire.
�
���� That was how most of the following nights had been spent. With one major exception. One night, after they had passed the final concentric circle of guards, literally in no-man's-land, they nearly stumbled onto on an orkish horde. All told, nearly a thousand were gathered in a great heap in a clearing. The ground upon which their bare feet stomped about was only blighted earth. Every single shoot of grass had been burned and then trampled to pieces. Every tree which should of occupied the impossibly barren wasteland was destroyed and fueled a roaring bonfire which shone so brightly that Bleach had been fooled into waking only to be stifled from crying out in horror. The cretins which cavorted about the great fire were unclothed, yet were covered perversely with thick, coarse hair.
�
���� Surrounded by groups of lecherous orks were women, naked and afraid. Small children were mercilessly snatched away from the protective circle of their mothers' arms and were bound tightly together in bunches with barbed wire. More hideous than this was the intended purpose of the fire. The children were scooped up and thrown alive into it as casually as if they were just fagots of wood.� From a thousand points of light, Buhrne witnessed the genocide and misery of its victims. He lost his will to interrupt the ritual out of a crushing revulsion; which he felt for himself. The burning of the heretics was poetic justice, yet this was unprovoked and purest evil.� If anything, the orks were amused by the response which they received from the captive women. 
�
���� The ugliest and strongest ork was a mammoth who was missing a foot so that he limped along. On his head he wore a black crown made from iron which was fused to his skull by a silver ax with an inscription on its blade with dwarven characters. The others regarded him as their king and chanted his name with fearful respect: "Blud! Blud!" Blud limped toward a young wench of fifteen. He threw her to the ground without protest, her face was stark of emotion as if it were carved on stone. His followers cheered.� Blud fell upon her deliberately and struck her in the face with his fist. As he began to rape her, he unsheathed a dagger from his belt and slashed her throat when he had finished with her.
�
���� Blud beheaded her and held her head by the hair aloft so that all present could see the piteous expression on that once beautiful face. "MEDUSA!" he yelled and the cry was repeated in unison by all of his cohorts.� That was the last straw.
�
���� Buhrne charged into the clearing with a war cry hot on his lips. The hateful bonfire, which had burned brightly before from its hideous fuel, exploded into a great inferno and sparks of flame were spat at the nearby orks on all sides. Buhrne himself tore the ax and the crown with it from Blud's head with incredible strength and smote the entire horde with it by chopping them to pieces. Blud, blood spurting as from a geyser from the gash on his head, collapsed and died. Regardless, his was the final head to roll into the fire.
�
���� Bleach watched the carnage. The huge ax swooped through the air with the energy of a bird in flight and fell across the neck of the fallen ork lord. He had not been the first of the demonic heathens to be attacked; yet it was entirely unnecessary. A wave of exhaustion ebbed in his heart, yet he stood firm. A single word sprang forth from his lips, without intending to, he shouted it: "Enough!"
�
���� The roaring bonfire belched and subsided into itself, the red blood which stained the carpet of dirt and ash evaporated; the bodies of the orks, which were covered in a dense group of flies during life and ultimately death, were forgotten. The minuscule insects dropped one-by-one and in droves onto the ground. They had not died, yet simultaneously lost interest in staying in the air..Each and every eye, whether the owner was one of his comrades or a squirrel or wolf in the outlying woods, was turned to him. In the matter of ten minutes, all that which the orks had so callously destroyed had become regenerated. After those ten short minutes, they all stood in amaze in virgin woodlands. This small boy, it was clear, was a....?
�
���� A mirage. Once again, they were amidst a desolate waste.� The child had succumbed to exhaustion where he stood. "This is the end," spoke each man in turn, and everyone else knew to what he was referring. The great fire continued to burn and spread along a path of corpses into the wood. Buhrne took his brother in his arms and marched into the west. His comrades followed listlessly at his heels.� The displaced animals calmly filed in behind them at a respectful distance.


A whisper. That was all. He faltered in a passionate sleep. The world came to him in the form of crisp sea air. He wrinkled his nose, unwilling to escape from the comfort of his dreams and the voice that whispered softly in his ears. He did not know what the words meant; yet they soothed him with the familiar tone of a lullaby. "Carpe dium."
Without further warning, he was thrown into the air and fell awkwardly into the surf. Gagging, he broke to the surface to find himself kneeling at the feet of his brother, who stood hip-deep in the briny water. Alcyone came along his flank and flipped a spray of water into their faces with her tail.
"`Seize the day,'" said Buhrne. He patted a hand against the top of his younger brother's hair and joined Alcyone in her play. The others lay prostrate along the beach; a pot full of water boiled away and the peculiar smell of cooking fish was in the air. 
Athens sat with his pants rolled up to his knees and his feet soaking contentedly in the water.� He had washed all the soot off of his face and was busy shaving his scraggly beard off with a razor. Kristofur pranced about on his hands with his stubby legs sticking up.

���� Bleach was oblivious to all of these wonderfully novel activities, remaining focused intently upon the time of day. He had overslept, the sun was just about high noon. He could just distinguish it from small gap behind a dark cloud that clung to the hemisphere from east to west and north to south.� Apart from that, by the meager light that the nearby cook fire afforded, he could see that it was almost complete darkness about.
�
���� In the distance, he saw a pair of venomous eyes glaring at him from a place that should have been fully illuminated. The old fear did not come to him. He fixed his glare fully upon that spot and thrust his right hand up in a clenched fist of defiance. "Garok Zandegoz karpack tu Novarusta!" he cried out in fluent dwarven and commanded the heavens to heed his call. The hammer transfixed itself between heaven and earth in an instant of lightning, leaving only an explosive crack of thunder in its wake. Whatever had been there a moment ago had fled.
�
���� Camp was struck. Buhrne surveys the scene with a trained eye. To the west, he can see only a marsh that they had circumvented for fear of the delay that it might have caused them in the long run. As a result, they knew not what dangers might lurk amongst those forbidden areas. He was dimly aware of a certain gargantuan lizard, far more deadly than a snake, which had jaws powerful enough to crush a man to death. A reptile. A caretaker who once worked for the circus was the first and only a person to ever tell him of it.� He, the caretaker, used to be a beast tamer until one of his arms had been forfeited for his life in one grisly accident.� He had killed the loathsome beast even as it gorged itself upon his appendage and made himself a pair of boots from its hide. Croc was the name he'd given to this beast.
�
���� Buhrne looked right, to the east. All he could see in the distance was the sea and nothing else besides. Wasn't there a legend, he thought, one that told of a city in the sea? The name of the city escaped him from a moment, yet he recalled it as time passed. Without his being aware of it, Alcyone emerged beside him from out of thin air. She guessed his thoughts and spoke just as the name occurred to him. "Atlantis," he said aloud.
�
���� "What of it?" she asked. He nearly shrieked in pure surprise but managed to hold his excitement with effort. "Sorry. It comes with the territory. I forgot how disconcerting that could be. I try not to have that effect on people, but I can't help it if you're so jumpy!"
�
���� "I'm not jumpy! Besides, this conversation isn't about my emotions. We weren't even speaking in the first place. I was just thinking. Thinking about the mythical city Atlantis. That's all. Just thinking," he insisted, although weakly. Sometimes, she could really get on his nerves.
�
�
Bleach looked over at the mermaid and his brother as they pretended not to speak with each other. A being of water and the master of fire. He had no idea how those two could mix. Together, yet separate, fire could be used to boil a pot of water. Yet, you could not make a fire warmer or cooler by pouring water upon it. All you would succeed in doing in is putting out the fire. One negates the other. It was like some cosmic game of "paper, rock, scissors" which the fates played to amuse themselves and befuddle mankind. Then, he returned his concentration onto the task at hand. For what purpose, he knew not. The fact that night had come didn't even occur to him. He was awake. 
�
���� "It's not a myth," Alcyone said. "It is legend amongst� land-dwellers because of the great fame it once had, yet it isn't pure imagination. It once existed long ago and still does to this day. It's still here. It has never left us. Atlantis shall never fall." She sounded quite sure of it.
�
���� "But what of the cataclysm? The one which reformed the world? Look out there and tell me, truthfully what it is that you see. Anything?" he said as he pointed toward the horizon.
�
���� "You know my eyesight is more keen than yours, mortal man. I agree with the fact that you cannot see that which you were never meant to behold. I see only a fool. And that should be plain to you, if you would but see your own reflection for what it is worth. You remind me of a lover of mine I once knew, long ago. Perhaps you have heard of Narcissus?" Her smile acquired a unique touch of honesty to it. He felt his heart melt with admiration. However, he maintained his composure.
�
���� He squatted down so that the water rose from his hips to his breastbone and took her up in his arms. He kissed her cheek. "Surely you are not so old that you are now acquainting yourself with such a character of historic infamy." Those were the last romantic words spoken among them. As he turned his gaze from her face, he caught a fleeting glance at his younger brother's face and did not like what he had seen. On the grave, clean face of the former, a blemish had suddenly arisen above the right eye.
�
����� He stared at it in disbelief. He stared for so long, in fact, that Bleach saw him and� held his gaze quizzically.
�
���� Buhrne spoke once more and this time his voice was dry and full of seriousness. "You know of Atlantis, is that right?" he asked Alcyone, yet his eyes did not leave that single pimple on the child's face. She balked and drew back from him with dismay. "You know where it is and you can find your way there without any trouble." He looked at her just then and she didn't like what she saw, either. "I know you do and I am absolutely sure that you can."
�
���� "No!" she protested. "I can't! It's forbidden allowing any... I can't!! There's nothing there that is of any interest to you. It's too dangerous!" She instantly had withdrawn further off into deeper water before he could react. "I'll never let you go there! I'm not even allowed there, for it is forbidden to return once one has left before. I was starting to love you. Doesn't that mean anything to you at all?"
�
���� He only continued to look at her, then he turned away and began to wade further down stream. She came after him and pleaded that he should stop, yet he ignored her. "My task has been set," he replied. She caught one of his hands and tried to pull him to shore. Only then did he act. He turned about quickly and swept her into his arms so that he held her like a man who carries his bride to a honeymoon suite. He kissed her full on the lips and together they sunk beneath the tide as a great wave crashed over them. Bleach attempted to follow them, yet Athens waylaid him before he could set reach the water and the watched as a series of bubbles broke the surface. The two lovers were gone.
�
���� "Let them go, child. Let them make their own choice. There is nothing you can do or say to stop them, now." Bleach wept against the old man's chest. "Nothing," repeated Athens, choking back his own tears.
�


�
���� Despite the danger, they remained camped at the sea for another four days. Grief infected them all in the form of some unknown disease. All had grown cold and sullen, Bleach was the first to become ill.
�
���� A caravan of lunatics had come into their midst and then left. These people had claimed to be colonists who wished to explore a new frontier in the west, "beyond the frontier." A few of the hundreds of emigrants had spoken with Athens and he managed to discourage them from such foolishness. They went back to their respective homes in disappointment.
�
���� From a young fellow who's head was completely bald,� Athens was told that the wraiths which had so adamantly pursued them not a week ago had already forgotten them. They had folded in on themselves sullenly and decided to leave outsiders on the outside. "There was something doing when I was there last," said the young man. "Something big. Although... I never found out what it was." He cracked his knuckles.
�
���� Athens was squatting on the floor, his eyes studying his hand of cards. He glanced in the young man's direction for a second as he was picking his own cards back up and sorting them. He saw no expression on the young man's face. "How do you know all of this... `information' ?"
�
���� "Same way I am learning some from you, old timer," the bald guy responded. He took a card from the deck, considered it for a moment, then put it back to get another. "I won it in a card game along with this watch from a red-headed hick." He finally found a card that he liked, because he smiled for the first time and put it down face-up on the bench between them. It was the ace of hearts. "Your move."
�
���� "Hit me." The kid did. "Blast it! I meant, `give me another card!'" Athens rubbed his shoulder that throbbed from the blow.
�
���� "I knew that. I was just obliging you." He gave Athens another card. "You've twenty showing. I think you're busted, old timer. But, I'll give myself another card." He got the five of spades. Athens turned over his cards: a 2, a 7, a 4, another seven, and an ace. The dealer had the ace, a ten, and the five. The dealer's face twitched for a second, but Athens didn't notice. He was too busy knocking back a drought of whiskey. By the time he looked at the other man's face, he had regained his composure and was absolutely beaming. "Sorry, pops. You lost. Your score is 21, I have 26. I win by five points."
�
���� Athens slammed his fist on the bench in fury, scattering the cars onto the floor. "Are you sure this is how you play blackjack?"
�
���� "Absolutely," replied the card shark. He held his hand out for Athen's bottle. "Now, you don't want to Welsh on our bet, do you? I wagered my watch, you put up your juice. Give it to me."
�
���� Athens did. He broke the bottle on the cheater's head, punched him across the right temple, and slammed his bald noggin on the bench so hard that he almost cracked it like a big, pink egg. In the least, he'd knocked him clean out. "I'm not so old as to be so easily beaten at a child's game, youngster," he spat on the deceiver. He shuffled over to the fire to warm himself.
�
���� They had dug a shallow pit, rectangular, in the ground and filled it with rocks. Running length-wise down the center was the carcass of a deer on a spit. To counteract famine, Bleach had taught the men how to hunt using the same elven ways that Timbre had taught to him. He himself only made the armaments and refused to kill anything when he was asked. He'd had reached the conclusion that he'd killed enough things in his lifetime, recalling the episode with Lady Phyllus. The fire itself had not been summoned by magic, but by a single match accompanied with some dry grass and leaves for fuel.
�
���� Truth be told, famine was not the cause for this bloodletting. The men, after a while grew tired of eating fish, if not with the way Bleach caught them. When there was a need, He would stand on the bank and call for the fish and they would voluntarily leap from the water onto the shore to lay completely motionless; even while men came scurrying out of the bushes like savages playing hide-and-seek to spear and roast them alive in the fire like scaly marshmallows.
�
���� As for the protagonist himself, for only the second time in his whole life, he could not sleep. Then, all at once, he found that he could.
�

����� His malignant heart was rife with a hatred of all things. Everything within his sight, he hated. Every sound in the night, every nuance of life and un-life, the incessantly chirping crickets, the silence of stones, were all things which his ambiguous hatred consumed of him. He had once seen his own face, in the glimmering steel of a knife he had intended to steal from a butcher, and hated himself at first sight. He had not known what it was that he had perceived in that brief second before he had struck at it in rage, before he had cut himself so grievously that he bled.� He had drank of his blood that first time, instinctively suckling from it as a newborn child would of another source --- only, his initial motive had not been merely an act of gaining nourishment, but in a reflexive action. After-wards, he hated the butcher for possessing such an object to bring harm to him. He hated pain even more than all things, even more than he'd hated himself a moment ago. He'd taken the knife, carried it with him into the home of the butcher which had brought him such pain, and gave it back to his enemy in a way much more intimate than the butcher would have ever wanted. He had given it back to him--- right through the bastard's heart.

���� There had been a time when his life had not been so simple, when he had agonized for many hours, many days, every waking moment. And every one in which he wasn't awake at all, his misfortune had plagued him in his dreams, as well. He had so desired not to be in such chaos, had wanted to settle for one and only emotion. Something he could count on. A friend which would never leave him, no matter where he went. A friend he could never leave behind, even if he thought that he no longer need it, because deep in his heart, he would always need it. He so desperately wanted a friend. A guiding light, a dream.

`What had he been thinking? Everything in that particular dream had been the complete inverse of anything he'd ever thought of in his entire life! Still, ... had he been dreaming?� A shocking epiphany. Death had taken so many people from him already; his mother, the father whom he had never met, an innocent girl whose only crime was her affections toward him, and... his brothers (one of which he'd never spoken with even though they were together all throughout life, and an elder brother who left so soon). He wanted to weep, but the tears wouldn't come to his eyes, as if such emotions had been irreparably frozen within himself. He had never known hate. However, now, after awaking from a nightmare of emotions barren of hope for salvation, he could only grieve in the face of a bleak future. 
He lay on his side, just at the edge of the surf, watching as the sand was at first swept away by a wave and returned --- seeing his reflection continually form just within the reach of his hand and retreat as if it were on a pendulum --- when he cocked his head to the side and looked out into the horizon. He could see a shining light, as if a star had come down from the sky and decided to swim in the cool, inviting waves as he wished to. The light sparkled in his eyes and caused him to smile despite himself. �
���� He rolled over onto his back and saw another remarkable thing. An arc of a rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, and a thousand dazzling colors in between) was originating somewhere in the far east and followed a straight course directly above his head and rested at that distant point of light in the sea. It was so beautiful.
�
���� Laughing, he leaped to his feet in a flash of adrenaline, tearing the clothes from his body rather than merely disrobing in the blink of an eye, and ran naked directly into the path of a fresh wave. Saltwater splashed all about him, forcing him to return to land, yet he kicked and fought his way through the barrier with sheer will power. 
�
���� Then, to his surprise, even above the pounding of the surf and his own frantic breathing, he could hear the cries of birds. They sang, a million shrill voices strong, Vagner's Ride of the Valkyries with incredible bravado. The first formation was of what seemed to be a squadron of aviary forces, arranged in a wide V, was spear-headed by an eagle with a single gilded arrow clenched in its talons. The eagle soared high above, hovered in the sky, then dove toward the earth. Just as it was about to completely crash, it banked to the right at the last moment, came around once, and finally landed effortlessly upon the top of an evergreen tree. The people, who had anticipated the poor creature's demise at the sight of such suicidal acrobats, cringed and averted their eyes in dismay.� All but Bleach. He saw everything and cheered.
�
���� The eagle swooped down from the tree, circled once more above Bleach's head and released the arrow from its grasp in mid-flight. Bleach caught the arrow deftly, without thinking about it or incident. The eagle cried once, then returned to its perch.
�
���� Holding one hand above his eyes while holding the arrow in the other, he looked off in the horizon once again. The eagle's retinue was a flock seagull, each one carrying a single fruit in its claws. The gulls came to earth individually, deposited its cargo onto the beach in a neat pile, and took its place on the tree with the eagle. Oranges, apples, grapes, etc.
�
���� Thirdly, completely alone, came a vulture. It wore a steel helmet on its ugly head and greedily clutched a dagger in a leather sheath in its scrawny clutches. Rather than offer any gift, the foul creature perched in the branches of a barren birch. The branch it first touched down on broke from its weight and fell, dead, to the ground. Dismayed, the vulture cursed to itself and finally chose another perch, this one much higher up than before. No one celebrated this arrival.
�
���� At the last, a dozen hawks arrived, carrying the most precious cargo yet. It was a swing crafted from fine silver and supported by chains on four side. Seated upon the swing was Buhrne, only with a full grown beard, and with what seemed to be an elven woman seated in his lap with her arms embracing his neck and her legs dangling across his thighs.
��
����� The woman waved as she were a tourist, grinning with amusement. Who was she? It was a shock to see how much he had changed after such a brief hiatus. ... How long had it been since he had last been among them? A few days, an entire week? A fortnight? Who could tell? What was so troubling about his appearance? ... Buhrne had said he was the son of a king. He had been lying. There were no kings, not any more. Not since the Massacre. He had said he was an elf; was that true? But ... he had, no he didn't have a beard before, but now... HE DID?! But that just couldn't be! Only Men and Dwarves could grow facial hair; right? 
�
����� Only when she spoke did they know who she was. "Well, don't just there like lumps of barnacles! Hop to it!" She leapt to her feet from her mythical chariot, yet unbalanced and fell to the ground almost instantly. Athens came forward with a large smile plastered to his face, as yet unheedful of the aviary companions which had descended not ten minutes ago. The vulture squawked in disdain. 

Athens it paid not so much as glance. He helped the woman to her feet. "I see that you are not used to your new pair of legs, Lassie How long is it that you have had them?" Athens asked.
�
����� "I have no way of knowing. Time passes differently for mortals in different parts of the world. How long has it been for you?" Alcyone asked.
�
����� "Far too long,� Athens said. Bleach wanted to say the same thing but didn't.

"So, may I guess to which place you are referring to (even though you won't mention it)?"
�
����� "Oh, you!" she piped up.
�
����� The others began to flock toward them. "May I introduce to you Lady---" began Athens, introducing her as a ring-leader would.
�
����� "Alcyone!" interrupted Bleach. Athens looked a little sour at this. He came to her, kneeled, and embraced her knees. "You forgot to shave your legs!"
�
����� "Oh?" she frowned. "I never knew that." He smiled. Now, she looked exactly like Amy.
�
����� Buhrne dismounted with much more grace, rather accustomed to his predicament. "Greetings from parts unknown to you, as of yet." He pranced as if he expected a flourish of trumpets from unseen heralds. He, as expected, was met with a barrage of questions, none of which did he so much as attempt to answer. "Please, it has been a long time since I have eaten a proper meal. Such is the quisine I have supped on for I know not how long. What day is this?" For once, he was met with silence. No one knew. What day is it? "That was one which I was afraid of." He studied every detail with a keen eye, finding some difficulty with his eyes. When he turned in Bleach's direction, he frowned slightly. Alcyone followed his gaze. She stepped away, her hands falling limply to her sides. Bleach had been standing there, naked and no one actually noticed. He looked down at himself self-consciously and was even more shocked at what he saw than any one else. He clasped his hands around his privates to cover them and streaked back to the concealment of the water. All eyes followed. He knew not when, but he had grown a ginger coating of hair down there.
�
�
����� Not long afterward, a during an awkward silence, a mariner spoke out. He was eating a fish and continued to chew as he talked. He confessed to know a way they could find out the time of day (by building a sun-dial) and how they could ascertain which day it was. "You see, often times, the captain of a vessel would elect to land his ship on the nearest isle..."
�
����� "How does any of this help us? We're on land, you imbecile. What does it matter to us, your telling these silly fish stories at times like this?"� butted in some one as the mariner paused to wash down a mouthful.
�
����� "Are you finished, you pansy?" asked the mariner. No response. "As I had been saying. As I had been saying... the captain would run 'er a-ground so we could look about the lay of the land and send out a party of men to scrounge up any food to eat. And, if he was truly lost, now here's where my story is pertinent to us: he would send a message out in code and send it through pigeon to a compatriot back at his home land. Now, if we could only find us a suitable messenger to send off..."
�
����� Not everyone was listening. Staying aloof from prying eyes, the two brothers and Alcyone walked side-by-side-by-side through the winding paths in the wilderness, discussing many things. It is not known which topics were addressed or by whom. Yet, at some point their steps were bent inexorably to the beach. Their feet formed tracks in the sand which constantly meandered together. They didn't realize they had come to the trees until a pale blob fell past Buhrne's face. The vulture cackled, having nearly defecated upon him from above. "Dirty Beast," commented Alcyone, who now took the name "Eve." Intrinsically,� Buhrne was now "Adam."
�
����� "I realize the significance," mused Bleach. "No need to go into that. But I just can not understand your entrance. You had left through the sea and return with a retinue such as these majestic beasts. Why?"
�
����� Adam mused. He stroked his beard vigorously as if the discussion were allegorical, despite Bleach's protest. He spoke fleetingly, as if his words were sent to him telepathically from a deity in the distance. "We were guests of the LORD and it is by his behest that we are here..." He smiled briefly with pride at his words.
�
����� "She had been right in calling you Narcissus earlier," muttered Bleach.
�
����� "What?" asked Eve.
����� 
����� "I was wondering to what you were speaking of. What 'Lord' is it that you speak of with such regard?"
�
����� "Poseidon. Neptune. Who is the lord of everything. The Air, the Seas, everything." There was a hole in this argument, left wide open. Yet Bleach was not willing to be suckered into treading upon thin ice just yet. However, he was expected to take the plunge. He had no choice but to take this chance, but no before a little preparation. Adam and Eve were together, his left arm curled along her shoulder and then across her back, the hand resting on her hip. With his right hand, he caressed both of hers, gently kissing her knuckles. They seemed the perfect couple, like the mythical founders of Eden had been reincarnated before him. Theirs is a love which will never die. What was the tragic flaw of those original lovers?
�
����� "-hip the lord?" said Buhrne.
�
����� "Excuse me? I didn't quite hear what you said."
�
����� "I said, 'Now, will you pledge to forever honor and worship the lord?'" repeated Adam. The first time he had said this, he had not at all sounded like he did now. His voice had momentarily regressed to the old accents which Buhrne had spoken with before.
�
����� "Not just� yet. Tell me, how is it that you say that he is master of the air, as well as his own domain. Yet you choose� not to say what relationship he has with dry earth. Is that he reigns where none may intrude? 'Out of sight, out of mind'?" Bleach spoke earnestly, holding a hand up democratically as if weighing the issue in his mind as his words leadened the air. "Also, I have considered things in a new light. How is it that you the two of you return to us in such transformed shapes? He was an elf, she a mermaid. Now, you both are mortal as I. How is this?" He took a step backward from them, suddenly cautious. 
�
����� "Such questions from a stripling. Might I ask you how I left a boy here only to return to find an early blooming adolescent in his stead?" returned Adam. Touche. "I will answer your suspicions any other time, Midas. But unfortunately, we have more precious matters to deal with."
�
����� He broke apart from them so abruptly that neither Eve or Bleach seemed to realize at first that he had gone. They shortly followed his lead.
����� 
����� Adam walked to the live tree where the eagle was serving as sentinel. He whistled and the eagle down to perch on his arm. "The eagle is his emissary of the higher reaches of the earth; he himself oversees its depths and all great mysteries which lie within. Yes, those places, at this current time, are beyond the reach of your grasp. Since you may breathe, you claim that is yours, too. Or, you can only sail your ship across the top of the water, that is your, too.� In both respects, you are wrong. Everything is his to command. If he so wished, he would destroy� every ship so much as touch a thimble of full of water until men learn to never build another. He would refuse to irrigate your crops so that clouds would only release their burden above the sea. You and all beasts which live on land would die. However, since he is merciful, such punishment has not become dispensable. He alone is sovereign."
�
����� Throughout his monologue, Adam preached rather than instruct his pupil. Of all his lessons he had learned, Bleach was absolutely certain not a word had truth in it. If Neptune were so gracious, why he would such a blithering fool to sing praise?� Perhaps it is a test. The woman which had once had more in common with a fish than with homosapiens had been willing to give up heritage and amenity for the love of his land-liver. And he once been immortal and graced with the gifts of clean soul. Now, his love was given to a strumpet. Is love, even the most alluring, worth such sacrifice? He did think so.
�
����� "Not impressed? To be brief, I should expedite things by taking the opportunity to acknowledge your accomplishments." He murmured in a vague resemblance of what Bleach recognized as elven. The eagle didn't understand, so Bleach translated. It flew aloft into the horizon, to the east.


�
���� "He, in his infinite wisdom, has chosen you as a great heroic... hero... and has sent you the trophies which you shall need to accomplish your chosen path --- you already have been given the Golden Arrow of Athene, the most sacred artifact of the Elves who died during the Fiedelveph (*"Many tears.) slaughter. You have already gained the respect of their descendants, so it is your gift. Since you are yet unknown of to the dwarven community, you must earn Aries' Helm." A paganism, war and peace preserved in two such objects. Also, even though Buhrne, the old Buhrne, already knew of Bleach's relationship with Zandegoz, he seemed to discount this fact. Or was he surreptitiously divulging to Bleach about the fate of that mighty dwarth since the last time that they had seen each other?
�
���� Bleach looked straight up into the eyes of the scavenging beast and shivered. Even from far below, the stench of death which pervaded from its breath was a loathsome sentiment to begin a day. He wished he could destroy this harbinger of beyond. Never had he desired such a thing without the pretense of nourishment. He desired to; what? Did he begin to realize the true meaning of his horrible dreams? That thought was so hideous that he began to question his own strength of will. Fate must surely be against him. The beast laughed at his fears. For lack of a proper bow, he nevertheless prepared to hurl the arrow at with only his bare hand.
�
���� It was Adam who staved his wrath. "Do not profane your destiny! If you do not, then you and all others will die. It is your task to venture to the depth of hell, as Orpheus did; and to climb the peak of Olympus, such is the true and only way of things. You are the only savior for us all. You will become our hope."
�
���� When they had returned to the parley, not much in the way of a friendly conversation was in progress. The mariner who had been speaking of a strategy to escape had withdrawn into a corner and was busily curses under his breath. His face was in shadow, hunched over secretively within himself. His opponent in a game of checkers was a jolly buccaneer whose face was bathed in the light from the candle which was in the center of a table. He, on the other hand, paid more of his attention to a floozy which was leaning over his shoulder to whisper in his ear. He made one final move before getting up to accompany the woman elsewhere. The old mariner didn't
seem to mind the intrusion. He just remained seated, continuing his monologue about "the rudeness of the common fellow," without pausing even a moment to take a breath.
�
���� Bleach sat in the empty seat across the old sot. He tapped his fingers on the table and looked at the game board for an entire minute. "So," he said. The mariner apparently didn't hear him. "So, would you like to play another game besides this?"
�
���� "Besides this?" pronounced the old mariner. "What?"
�
���� "`What game would (I) rather be playing "besides this"' ? Well, I have no objections to this particular game, except for the fact that I don't know how to play."
�
���� "What other game is there?" asked the mariner, sitting up straight in his chair with interest. His posture had improved so significantly that he seemed to have become younger. He gestured at the unfinished game with his open right hand.
� 
"Well have you got a deck of cards?"

"No. What card games do you know how to play?"

���� "None." 

���� "So, what difference does it make? You don't know how to play anything, any how. So, let's just break out the checkers and play another game," suggested the mariner. To demonstrate this, he neatly set the pieces into their correct order on the board with adept skill.
�
Bleach took the older man's wrist into his hand walked him over to the opposite end of the room; where some drunken fellows had helped themselves to a barrel and were having a game of darts. None of them were particularly skilled at either one. The others had resolved themselves to give these fellows and their contest a wide berth.
�
Bleach took a step toward one of the contestants and said "excuse me." The man snorted and threw a dart at him. Bleach easily caught it in mid-air, even though it passed over his right shoulder any how. The mariner had reflexively ducked and was almost as shocked by the young boy's skill as the others were. Bleach hadn't just caught it. He'd caught it by its sharp needle tip between his thumb and forefinger. He adjusted his grip so that he held it by the shaft and then easily tossed it at the dart board behind him without turning around. Regardless, he struck dead-center.

�������� The mariner scratched his head bewildered. "I don't know how you did it, kid. I don't reckon much that it matters. All I know is I better not try and play against you. I'm not sure I could ever win."

��������������The fellow who had thrown the dart was rather put-off by the occurrence as he was. "Dammit!! I once saw a guy in Tahoe who could do that, but he used a mirror!�You must have eyes in the back of your head or an angel-kiss blessing in yar britches."

����������Bleach was from flattered. "It wasn't luck... winning anything isn't important.�
A third man spoke up, �Easy for him to say; fella who can�t lose probably wouldn�t mind winning again.�

�Who says I�ll win every time? It was just a single throw.� 

�Ah dunno. Cohd beh hizzum faerie�� grumbled one of the drunks along the bar. 

�Aye, you might�nt be right there, Darrel. Praps the lad be touched.�

�You mean he have a charm? Something that helps him win?�

�Hey, you old fayg�t, were you wagering with this lad?�

�I�m not a fayg�t,� muttered the mariner, but not too convincingly. 

Bleach was aghast by this round of questioning. �It was only a single throw��

�Yah, and quite a catch at that.� This fellow winked at his friends.

�I can�t believe�� Bleach began.

�Maybe this little one�s the fayg�t!� shouted another man. This one took his mug of beer and splashed it�s contents all over the front of Bleach�s pants. �See? Fayg�t wet himself.� 

�Har, har. A faerie fayg�t wettening hissum pahnts.�

�I dinna mean thut. Meant he might be mahgic,� protested the drunk. 

�Magic? Oh? And what drink could he possibly know? How to piss his farking pants like a li�l baby waby?�

A chorus of laughter this time. Chants of �baby waby� made the rounds.
Raging with fury, his eyes alight with a glow of his wrath, he struck the laughing man with all his might. The clash of his small hand upon that hard and stern face was deafening. He retrieved his hand, the fingers broken with the force of the blow. He cradled his broken hand against his chest with the other arm. The others laughed harder still with the sight of his injuring himself.

They laughed at him and he closed his eyes, crying tears of shame. They continued to laugh until the man he struck fell forward and crushed him flat against the floor. He crawled from beneath the bulk of the man�s body and sat on the floor, staring in disbelief at it. Here he was, a small boy, sitting on the floor beside the body of a grown man. He sat there still, amidst silence. No one was laughing at the moment. All were in as much disbelief as he.

One man broke from the crowd and poked the body with his toe. Another fetched a pitcher and poured cold water upon him. Niether one availed. Crying miserably, the small child ran from the saloon while stared at his fleeing back in awe & relief that he should have decided to spare them. Into the wastes he might have wandered to die alone. Of whom no tales have told.

Being Happy-Go-Lucky with Jesus & Ourselves.
By Michael Owen Reeve

Jesus isn't a brooding, grim, unhappy guy. He's a happy, cheerful guy laying some good vibes on people. I'd go so far as to say he was the first "flower child". Not in the sense that he was disreputable. But he walked around wearing sandals, long hair, long beard, doing the odd job as whatever he could do to earn money, but his job didn't consume his life. He carpentered because he enjoyed doing it. Not because he NEEDED a paycheck.

He tried to get people to look on the bright side; to cast off their doubt & suspicion that life could improve under the shadow of the Roman Empire. He was a nice guy who did good deeds so other people would follow his example of spreading goodwill. But unfortunately the people saw fit to rise him up on a pedestal. "I'm not Jesus, I can only look towards his spirit for strength." This not what he truly wanted people to think. He wanted them to think they had strength, that they had power. The strength of an individual acting with integrity that isn't afraid of being ostracized by the crowd. Jesus was one such individual & he hoped that the people who followed him would share these qualities. Sure, they wouldn't be the Son of God like he was, but they don't have to be.

He didn�t want to be a King of Kings. He was a leader, but only in a time when people needed a push towards something to inspire them to band together & create something much better than what had come before. Moses & the other prophets could have been said to have been men who possessed a mania of compassion for the underclass who could not be content with being part of the crowd.

They had to speak against their oppressors and because they spoke up, the people followed them. Not because the prophets wished to lead but because the people were so content with their being followers that they lacked in the ability to be anything else. Everyone felt this compulsion, but not everyone was outfitted with the means of speaking in a way that would please the listener�s ear. �I don�t know what to say. I don�t know what tone of voice to use.�

Forgive my meager indulgences in egotism should they appear. I know they said this because they say it now. The people I see in this world are lost. They need to rekindle the passion they have for knowledge, for wisdom. To learn how to speak to each other unfettered & without restraint or worry for being judged negatively.

The people� we� as a people need to embrace our own true potentials. It matters not what religion you were taught as a youngster. No religion is wrong; just very few religions know how to be right. You must build a true foundation of communication with each other. Don�t worry about always being polite: be genuine. Say what you mean. It matters not the tone of one�s voice. Those who speak sternly at times speak this way out of passion. Everyone feels they are right, but not everyone is righteous. The Muslim, the Hindu, the Catholic, the Jew, the everything-in-between & beyond shouldn�t be content with disagreements & scorn for each other. We all can�t be of the same mind about things, but just because we disagree we don�t have to over-indulge in anger. Words spoken in true hatred are words best not spoken.

Pay no heed to tone, to seeming aggression of a person�s actions. When we empower these behaviors by reacting to them with fear & subservience we are lessening our strengths as individuals. Do not shackle your self in invisible chains made from fear of lack-of-conformity. �To thine own self be true� as Hamlet so wisely spoke.
 
So how to we empower the individuals? By bonding with our loved ones. Don�t struggle for the most appropriate and friendly thing to say. If you feel sad, say you feel sad. Families should hold bountiful love for each other. They should not fuel our own lack of self-worth. We don�t always feel like smiling. Smiling when we don�t really have anything to smile about forces a person into a fierce desire to please, to be the �happy� one. Do not be a dutiful servant to your family members, do it out of love. And how to do you acquire this love? By genuinely feeling it & genuinely expressing every emotion you feel to those you love.

Respect should be freely given. Love should be freely given. If you�re in a public place (such as a checkout lane), do not just stare at other people & wish you could talk to them. Open your mouth, say �hi� or �hello� and then begin to speak of the most cheerful thing you can think of discussing. You really like a TV show or something else others might share in and you never seem to find anyone who likes it? Don�t talk small. Talk big. If that other person isn�t receptive, chances are someone else around would be.

�Did you see Monk last night?� Pause. �That guy�s really brave I think. Despite the fact that he has such fears he�s willing to do the best he can do at whatever he sets his mind to.� You don�t have to worry about the proper wording of what you say. Life isn�t about reading from a script. (Unless you�re an actor.)

Oh, if you want to be an actor, maybe you should try doing voice acting for animation. It�s quite simple. Just read from a script, put a wealth of emotion into your voice, and speak into a microphone. 

Many Voice-actors are average people who dress averagely. Watch more cartoons. :D They aren�t just for children: they are valuable tools for maintaining a cheerful disposition. Mark Hamill & Tom Kenny among many others are fine examples of voice-actors. Anyone can do it. Not everyone has to look beautiful, but I feel when people speak confidently with their voices they all sound beautiful.

To perform you need not focus upon technique or gaining acceptance from the crowd. Don�t bother sweating what everyone else is doing, thinking, wearing, eating, or whatever. If speaking to that person does not cause you to feel happy, do not speak to them. Having no speaking connection, the person should not be acknowledged.

Too often we are spies of each other. We look about with suspicion. We are all lost in the world. We spend our time looking at people, looking, looking, looking, looking, and looking. We don�t like being quiet & polite all the time. We repress & control ourselves so that we depersonalize when in public. The people we don�t know become threats to our safety.

But how would you get to know someone if you don�t speak to them? Don�t worry if others deem your small amounts of bravery with scorn or discontent. It is out of jealousy. You are something. Jesus wished you to be humble, meek, merciful, peacemakers.

Stigmas are created out of fear. Out of an obsessive oppressive desire to be controlled. Never stigmatize. Never call another person �crazy� or �stupid� or any other hurtful words. Life isn�t a competition. You need not be better than another person at any given task. Just be. Oh, and �Cleanliness is next to godliness� has nothing to do with bathing or washing of the clothes. It means cleanliness of the SPIRIT, of the soul, of the mind. Do not over-burden yourself with anger towards another human being. Don�t struggle to be perfect. Live in spiritual comfort. You don�t have to dress to the nines. Wear comfortable clothing. Clothes mustn�t have to look nice. If you have a winning, grandiose, friendly disposition and are willing to happily & inexhaustively speak to another person, then you�ll do well in this world. Once we have obtained cleansing of our souls, hearts, and minds we can achieve our place in Heaven besides God. (Any sinner can take a bath to temporarily wash the filth of the body from himself but it is very hard to maintain our humble goodliness.)

Don�t repress, don�t hold your emotions chained in heart and your mind forever revolving around how much more full of money your wallet is than another person�s. Live frugally, utilitarianly. There are never too many words. Only too little. There are lechers in this world because men & women fear each other. If you are a woman and you see a man you like or you are a man and see a woman you like --- or you are a man who sees a man you like or a woman who sees a woman you like --- speak to that person warmly & ingratiatingly. Don�t be afraid to be thoroughly bubbly with your goodwill. �OH! I don�t feel it�s appropriate to do this or this!�

Have a hobby? Like books? Go to a book store. Buy something. If you have a favorite author, obviously you must have a strong opinion about that person for you to love them so much. Strike up a spontaneous & absurd conversation about something. You�d be amazed. No matter how completely embarrassed & silly you feel for having spoken in earnest about something you genuinely care about in public, the other person might react positively. I did the same not to long ago at a book store myself. I once hypothesized in the middle of a Borders Express store that: �Peter Parker always needed to believe in himself, he needed to believe that he didn�t have to hide his full potential as a person. He was Spiderman but didn�t let anyone else around him know it. I�m a writer but I don�t talk about it well. If Peter hadn�t worn his mask, people would not have feared him. You have to believe in yourself, you know?�

The young lady cashier muttered �I like Batman� & started giggling at herself for not being able to speak intelligibly. I retreated out of surprise. I couldn�t have possibly been that charming. I was nervous of from my lack of belief in myself so I left. As I left, she went to the backroom. When I returned, she wouldn�t leave the backroom. You see? We both felt crestfallen even as we�d achieved a connection. Was the interaction a disaster? Not at all. It was life.

I find it amazing how often I encounter people who are deathly afraid of a karaoke machine. Just stand on the stage, hold the microphone to your lips, & sing the words that appear on the screen. You don�t even have to be good to do it. You might be surprised how many people will come to search you out to shake your hand & tell you how much they admire you. For what? Being able to read & talk at the same time.

Talking is like singing. Don�t let anyone tell you �they are two completely different things.�




Dreams May Come To You.
by Michael Owen Reeve

I remember a TV show when I was a kid that had the theme song �when you wish on a star, carry moon beams in a jar� or some other doggerel. It was nice although I don�t think it had much to do with the premise of the show. Whatever that was� 

Dreaming is something many of us can achieve. It is discouraged to dream while one is awake. America is a place of a Dream many people in other countries have heard of. Hamlet himself uttered the words �what dreams may come� referring to an afterlife beyond that of a �mortal coil.� 

I know somewhat about dreaming. Perhaps writing & the imagination behind it is akin to dreaming? Dreaming is a manifestation of all that is impossible in this world. It is better than this world, it is the stuff of imagination when imagination is at its purest. We all dream, we speak of an American Dream but that dream never reaches fruition in this world, doesn�t it? Sleeping is an activity of the immobile. We all lay in a bed at one time in our lives but lying in bed too long is considered too much pampering of ourselves, we count the ours we sleep & tabulate them. We compare hours slept with others to find who got the better score. We are all tired of ours lives and sleep is a respite from it we relish. We wonder often enough about what it would like to actually be a hotdog.

Speaking of hot dogs, I am now thinking about barbecuing: it is in the hell fires we often find ourselves in this world. Every time we seethe with rage, every time we burn with desire, we spend our own time in hell. Hell on earth is an absolute certainty. To reach true peace within ourselves & to find happiness, to soar as angels we have to cast off the shackles & chains that Satan himself has put upon us and learn to find comfort in our pain that is life. A life of constant upheaval, a life made in which we forgive ourselves and others their mistakes & their small imperfections is a world in which we were meant to live in. 

I know I preach at times; at times I can be a downright heathen. Being among God is equal part piety and grace with an equal part of sacrilege and vulgarity. Many of us can be the lamb, some of the shepherds, and still more the wolves. Wolves are among us, they trim the herd. We live in a world of nature, we are all animals. We are animals of good fortune for having lived in this world but we are animals of bad fortune for the same reason. We cannot truly find peace in this life until we have gone the extra mile to walk away from our own poor piety, being impoverished in the soul is more damning than being without money. 

As the original people were born innocent of this world & naked, they damned themselves with impropriety once they decided to wear clothes for the sake of pride rather than to protect one�s nakedness from the elements. We are of a rainbow in colors in our skin pigments because of the severity of the sun shine above our heads. In all likelihood the closer we are to the equator, the darker the people became. It is with this assessment that perhaps those of us in the much milder climates have suffered the wrath of nature. Why should we give such wrath upon others with the form of our own God-given bodies??? It doesn�t make any damn sense to hate upon something HE provided us!  

COMMENTARY ABOUT A POSSIBLE �COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS.� 

There is a term I have learned from a Catholic friend of mine: Collective Consciousness. He specifically referred to a church group he was part of: each member of the group provided a part of a cohesive unit. Each member who faithfully follows the protocols and doctrines of the group is to be part of a chain. I myself have never really considered myself as being truly part of anything and therefore might upon cursory observation be designated the �weaker link� of any chain or CC I enter upon. 

Now that I am thinking of a Collective Consciousness, I will expand upon my observations of such: 

We tend to memorize texts � hell; we MEMORIZE nearly everything we can get our hands on because it gives the illusion of knowledge stored. The smarter you want to be perceived, the more things you have committed to memory. 

People expect you to remember verbal instructions the first time you hear them, even complicated ones. A dull memory is seen as a dull wit. 

You seem to have a very obstinate way of seeing things. You tend to improve when you can which is most of the time. You don�t care what other people think about you and you can extrapolate their thoughts not from reading their minds BUT from how they behave. 

You can see beneath the surface behavior. People don�t like being read as being outside of the norm. 

Let�s face it!  Jesus was persecuted because he was an unusual person. Miracles or not, he stuck out like a sore thumb. He challenged the aristocracy and undermined the religious practices of his time. He was a radical who was punished.

There have been lots of individuals in this world who have been treated unfairly because they were different somehow. Sometimes just having an unusual hair color is cause for scorn.  

Uniforms enforce the collective�s control over the individual. If each member wears the same thing, the group remains in control. Other armies wear different uniforms. Going with this assessment, is it any wonder why the Greek Olympics were carried out in the nude? Everyone �wore� the same thing so the competitions were clearly based upon skill & conditioning rather than in the cohesiveness of sub-groupings� not that I�m advising this sensibility to carried out in modern sportsmanship�.  (Thinks about it.) Ewww�.. 

So where does it fall that like-minded individuals should be so like-minded in their thoughts of EVERYTHING??? And why did I just call such people �individuals� when it would be just to infer they have a �cattle-mentality�? Why do they all graze upon the grass of ignorance? Why do they all moo the same way? Why walk so serenely into the slaughter houses? Why not zig-and-zag? Why not??? Why are they so obedient??? Why are they so programmed??? 

It takes the strength of an individual who �marches to the beat of his own drum� who has continually �suffered the slings & arrows of outrageous fortune� to set a positive example. Maybe not one of leadership perse, but one of self respect. Make a stand in a small way against the conformists. Brush your teeth a different way, don�t be afraid to wear your hair a little longer. Don�t be afraid to BE YOU!!! Don�t be one of them. Don�t just be a face in the crowd, but be a mind of your own among the like-minds. Just because a million others are 1s in perfect conformism doesn�t mean you should be a 0 in life. Remember:  �from zero to hero.� 

I�d like to reinterpret an old Beck song �I�m a loser baby�. aren�t you freaking jealous!?!?!?� Life is about being an orange in the apple basket sometimes, folks. 





   Bringing the Mind to Peace 
and Removing it of Sin.
By 
Mara The Sorrowful

Genesis 19:6 

6 But his wife looked back from behind him,
 and she became a pillar of salt. 

http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-26.htm

So was the fate of Lot�s wife as she witnessed the destruction of Sodom & Gomorrah. The place had been a place of sin and so great was the sin that God had it destroyed. All she did is witness its destruction, she is punished for it. 

The mind, body, and soul of deeply religious person in today�s society is equal to that of a pillar of stone. Their hearts and minds are hardened to armor them against the love that is God�s Love for them. Against the love of their fellow man. 

The teaching of Jesus upon the Sermon on the Mount were many wise and well considered words. They will be a cornerstone of this book. But I do not wish to preach to champion the Christian Faith. Rather, I use these words to comfort the soul of all men & women upon the earth.  You may find solace in them if you are or are not a believer in him. 


I will begin with a most important concept. 
 Matthew 5-7 (King James Version)
http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MATT%205-7&version=KJV

25 Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?
26 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?
27 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?
28 And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:
29 And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?
31 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?
32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.
33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
34 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.


Jesus isn�t saying you should be a nudist. He�s saying DO NOT judge people by their clothes (aka �raiment�) if you think wearing your Sunday Best or an expensive piece of clothing gives you a higher place in Heaven than a bum wearing rags, you�re dead wrong, buster.

To whom is Jesus speaking? Who does Jesus truly believe will follow him into Heaven & get their just rewards? You and me, my friend. God doesn�t judge you harshly for being gay or lesbian or bi or transgender or even heterosexual. He doesn�t care how you express your sexuality or gender. He made you different because he loves you and wishes to give you strength to stand up against your oppressors and say �NO!�

Be happy with who you are. I�m not here to pressure you to join any group you don�t entirely want to join. I wrote this document to give you hope for your future. Shine that light of yours that God has given you. If you�re LGBT, wave that Pride Flag high! If you are not, then speak no more sinful assertions against your fellow man or woman who are.


Now let�s back up a bit. 


www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MATT+5-7&version=NIV

�Matthew 5-7
King James Version (KJV)
5 And seeing the multitudes, he (Jesus) went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:
2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,
3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.
10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.�

And is when Jesus spoke the words �falsely, for my sake� he predicted that a series of new religions would spring up which claimed to be inspired by him and his sacrifice but ultimately were just a continuation of the practices of the Temple he sought to overthrow.

�12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward  in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.� And great the reward shall be��

Let�s step  outside of preaching mode for a moment so I may explain. I am referencing Jesus, but I am not speaking only to Christians. Jesus is speaking to those who have been outcast or teased or bullied. Whether or not you admit it, if you have been set aside because you are different, you have been persecuted.

http://facu.proboards.com/thread/139/goals-website?page=1&scrollTo=246

If you have been told you�re too tall, if you�re too short, or too this or too that. If you�re not good at sports, if you stutter, if you have ADHD, whatever� and people are using your difference from the norm against you, Jesus is looking right at you and giving you a promise towards salvation.

http://facu.proboards.com/thread/139/goals-website?page=1&scrollTo=246

Jesus isn�t going to save the bullies. The bully can go to church every sunday and swear on a stack of Bibles all he wants, and Jesus isn�t fooled by this deceit. Bullies threw stones at Jesus, the whipped him, and they murdered him. He will have not that person in Heaven beside you.


�14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.
15 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.
16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.�

A little opaque in the delivery, but Jesus is saying do not hide or feel shame for your gifts and God-given talents. If you can sing, sing. If you can draw, draw. If you can write, write. Do all the creative things you wish. Do not let the bullies and naysayers tell you to stop being you. Those who do so are jealous of you and your gifts, they wish to poison your mind against you so that they may feel satisfaction.

�20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.�

He�s saying that those who have been bullied & scorned are far better than those who do the bullying & scorning.



40 And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.
41 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.
42 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.
43 Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.�

Now I know the word �sue� gets a different meaning now than Jesus had meant. The word should be �request.� He means in these passages that you freely give of yourself to others, especially those who are poor or harmless who ask for help. That you should go beyond that, even, give the person roughly twice the help they request.

Now I�m not saying give someone twenty dollars just because they want ten. If you cannot realistically afford to give money, give them kindness. Be that person�s friend in the very least. By adding value and self-worth into their lives adds value and self-worth into your own.

http://facu.proboards.com/thread/139/goals-website?page=1&scrollTo=246

�44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;�

Need I explain? (smiles) Do not seek vengeance, but try and ask for God to forgive them.


�6 Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.
2 Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
3 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:
4 That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward  thee openly.�

http://facu.proboards.com/thread/139/goals-website?page=1&scrollTo=246

Fascinating. Jesus actually predicted mega-charities springing up! Don�t let them fool you, most of the money you give to these places to �feed the poor starving African children� doesn�t go entirely towards feeding them. A large portion of it pays for the salaries of paid actors & high production values� goes into the pockets of people who become wealthy thru this subterfuge.

http://facu.proboards.com/thread/139/goals-website?page=1&scrollTo=246

Jesus doesn�t pass the collection plate. If you worship somewhere that expects you to DEFY Jesus�s above proclamation against public charity, then do not go there. Don�t let them convince you they are serving his will, don�t believe the lies! This is the first of the crimes organized religion has made against him and the most telling example of their falsehood.

�5 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.�

Okay, not literally in your closet. But in Jesus�s time there were only synagogues. But if Jesus were alive today, he�d tell you not to go into a Church either. Any building that says it is �God�s House� and exists only to profit off of people seeking enlightenment is a place of sin.

He is saying your prayer should be a private thing between you and God, that God will see you pray and will hear your words no matter how secretly you do it. In fact, you don�t even have to pray at all. He�ll read your mind, he will know what bothers you and will do his best to give you happiness but he cannot give everyone instant gratification for there are so many other people in need.

�7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.
8 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.�

Jesus is specifically saying do not form your prayer as a routine thing you say. Don�t say Grace, don�t say The Lord�s Prayer before you go to bed. God will hear your words and ignore you. And back to the mind-reading I said earlier. Sweet.

�9 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
10 Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
11 Give us this day our daily bread.�

This passage is invalid because it contradicts his edict against �vain repetitions.�


What have we learned? We have learned not to value Organized Religion�s doctrines above our own self-worth. We have learned not to make a show of charity or prayer. We have also learned to not structure our prayer in the form of a prideful speech. We have discredited the tools that the bullies use to oppress us. 

This is the end of the first part of my narrative. Be well. See you in Part Two. 




THERE WAS SOMETHING OUT THERE IN THE DARKNESS. Something hungry. KeeLow didn�t believe HomeBrew. He said HomeBrew was illin�. Now KeeLow was dead. HomeBrew lay in a corner of the pickup�s bed parked in the alley. He did his best to remain motionless with KeeLow�s sagging dead weight on top of him like a blanket. He hoped whatever was out there would think he was dead, too.

HomeBrew�s real name was Bernard. He�d gotten his name because he drank only homemade coffee from a thermos he�d had since he was a child. He ate mostly chocolate ice cream & chocolate yogurt. HomeBrew was at the best of times a twitchy, nervous man. But this wasn�t the best of times. He was� well, how did he wind up here? He had no idea who the heck�s truck this was. Wasn�t even quite sure what color it was because it so dark. All he knew for sure was the was scared. And he had to move his bowels.  

- Written as a cliff-hanger circa 2009.


Bernard's Day Before.

Goddamn, this one's gonna wreck me, Bernard was thinking. He got up out of the couch slopilly, nearly falling down. He had to be careful. KeeLow tossed the second controller at the back Bernard's head which it bounced off of. 

�Wiggle your black ass back here! I'm not letting you take a dive! I let your cheap ass play Johnny Cage all these frickin' years! Cheap ass bitch!� KeeLow yelled. 

�Just snort some cocaine or something, dude,� said Bernard, wiggling a little bit faster. 

�You must be kidding a brother!� screamed Kee-Low as he got off the couch as well. 

From the kitchen stormed a large woman in an apron. �Kevin Lovenski! I told you not to get excited when your friends come over to play that stupid crap!�

Something in Bernard's stomach exploded. �Oh no!�

�Goddamit, Bernard! I told you if you do that often enough I'd put your black ass in diapers!!!�

She ran into the kitchen and came out with trash bag. �Lord have mercy,� she prayed to herself, �two grown men without jobs playing that Blasphemy!' She put the trash bag on the couch for Bernard to sit on. 

�Oh come on, mom. It's Sega Genesis...� Kee-Low complained.  

- Yet another cliff-hanger, but this written circa 2016.







Shattered Psyches
by Michael Owen Reeve

I

The intermingling grasses of the veldt dance in the warm breeze as if enthralled in celebration, back lit by the waning light of an afternoon sun. Today is special. After a long draught, the thirst is finally quenched with the blood of a dove. 

II


In an abbey in the far east of the charted world, before all maps had been drawn, there lived a small contingent of monks. These were old men who had no other place to live. They were not the sort of men who would be welcome and easily wore out their welcome not very long after they had first arrived in a new place. Now, if you will listen, I believe you can hear these unwelcome monks returning home.


�Scourges upon scourges.� The other four continue walking, then look back to see that the fifth of their company had slipped in the mud and fallen to his back. He was a very tall and heavy man dressed in what had been a gaudy costume of expensive clothing. He carried no weapon upon his person, but possessed such strength that had he wanted to, he could kill a man (or even a bear) with his barehands alone.

His four comrades stared at him and shuffled their feet, waiting to see if he�d ask for assistance. It wasn�t wise to offer unsolicited help to this fellow. He was a proud, insufferable man. �Tinli, would you mind?� he asked, holding his hand up.

Tinli, the smallest of the four cautiously walked back to where the large man lay upon the floor. He said not a word.

�Would you mind holding the bottle?� asked the large man. Tinli took the bottle and stepped back a pace. The large man stood and brushed himself off. He checked himself quickly for bruises and satisfied that he had taken a little tumble without sustaining much harm to his person, snatched the bottle back. There was only the slightest bit of liquid left in it, but he had carried it for a thousand miles. Perhaps the first dozen of those miles it had been full.

Tinli lowered his eyes to his feet as if he�d been caught stealing the bottle. The large man snatched at his wrist, turned the palm upward, and dropped a coin into it, then closed the hand. Tinli put the tip into his pocket and made sure to wait until the large man was no longer looking before rubbing his wrist.

�Well, I do hope that the gods weep. Now look at me, Tirskon Varg, once a good monk and then a merchant, and now an itinerant beggar. Look where I have been placed. Look at the misfortune that is upon me.�

�Varg, if I knew who could be blamed for your being with us, I would promise that person would die a horrible and excruciatingly painful death. At mine own hands,� commented a slight figure wearing a black robe. This one was covered in a curly, matted hair and had a medium-length beard.

�Now, it is doubly amusing to hear a rich man speak of the gods and to have a sister speak of murder,� commented an elderly man wearing a white cloak. He smiled for a few minutes, but then decided it prudent to stop smiling since no one else seemed to find his joke amusing. �Forgive me Varg. I hadn�t meant to contradict your claims of poverty.� A hiss came from the black-robed thing. �Forgive me also for the transgression. Did not mean to imply you weren�t a brother.�

�Ulowlin, this is probably one of the few moments in all the time that we have been acquainted with each other that I feel I would regret killing you,� Varg growled. �Any man who the witch despises must be useful.� The witch in question ignores this last comment.

�A wonderful time for firsts,� agreed Ulowlin. He wiped sweat from his forehead. Varg nodded gravely at him.

�To what shall I bless with my final swallow?� asked Varg, holding the bottle up by the neck. �Well, besides the chance of finding another bottle?�

�That would be a wish,� commented the black robed thing.

�It would be so easy to forget that you were a woman, Manke. It wouldn�t take much effort in fact.�

�Insulting me is the simple part, Tirsk. Backing up those words, however. Well, you might find yourself in for quite a lot more effort than you usually would put into anything else. Do not bless me with your poison. Do not curse me without either.�

Ulowlin stood between them, raised his hands, and then thought better of touching either person. So he lowered them back down to his sides. �Have any of us put any thought into the meaning of our strange predicament? What is it that the amulets we wear signify? Or why it is we carry such odd objects?�

�It is the burden of Habakkuk,� put in the last member of the party to speak. His was the heaviest pack among the group and he also wore a harness on his shoulders and dragged a cart full of wares as well. Tinli took up the rear and endeavored to push on the rear of the cart but not to help for he was too hard small to lend much assistance. Yet he felt safer having something between himself and the others.

�Do shut up, Yosef,� interrupted Tirsk. �You are hardly Habook-material.� He drank the last few drops from his bottle and then tossed it negligently behind his back. The others ducked their heads to prevent being hit by and it and it flew completely over Tinli�s head and shattered at his heels. He didn�t complain, though.

Ulowlin took his hat from his head and worried it between his hands for a moment. Many times he regretted being the peace-keeper in the group. �I don�t feel he means himself. I think he had meant the amulets we wear are said burden.�

Manke scoffed. �We don�t even know who this fellow is. Surely if we did, we could return the burden of them to him. I for one am tired of speaking in tongues. People don�t like being accused of showing off their �iniquity� and �perverseness.� Not very good way to start a pleasant conversation among people you hadn�t met before.�

�Aye. And nearly everyone is put off by us saying �destruction and violence and strife and contention are riseth up before me.�� Tinli piped up. Then he scratched his chin for a moment. �Aren�t those all the related to the same thing? The strife & contention are basically ways of describing a fight and the other two are the usual results of such rows.�

�You�re quite right, Tinli,� Ulowlin raised his head to smile, but lowered it again when Tirsk growled at him. �Sadly we�ve been accused of starting those arguments. �Hey, you�re lying! Nobody was fighting anyone until you showed up. So the strife starts AFTER you arrive and not before.�

Manke laughed. Tirsk growled at her, too. �Sorry, this beard keeps tickling my nose.� Tirsk grunted his disbelief. Well, lucky for us, sometimes they�ll look outside their gates to the next town over and decide to blame them instead of us.�

�Oh, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear? I cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save,� put in Yosef. Manke glanced at him. �Metaphorically speaking.� Manke raised her eyebrow. �I wasn�t saying you were crying, dear.�

�Don�t wonder marvelously if I will not believe everything you told me.� Manke smiled sardonically.

�I�m not sure if we are or are not justice.� Tinli bumped his knee on the cart, leaned down to rub it with his hands, and then bumped his head on the cart as he leaned. He cursed.

Ulowlin: �What do you mean?�

�Perhaps �the law is slacked,� yet we couldn�t be because �justice doth never go forth.� That can�t be true of us because we�re always traveling. Yet if we are righteous, then wickedness surely does compass all about us. But then again, if we are justice, I don�t like the idea of us going forth �perverted� because that seems to mean we�re tainted by the evil around us and our goodness is diluted.�

�Right you are. And, really what nation isn�t �bitter and hasty�? Each and everyone is just raring to �march through� and... devour the bread of the world? I�m not sure about that part, but certainly they wish to �to possess dwelling-places that are not theirs.��

Manke scoffed again. �All you men are alike. You all set your faces forward, are �terrible and dreadful.� Even though you kid yourselves into believing your �dignity proceeds from being �more fierce than the evening wolves,� you forget that you once were toothless babes who wouldn�t survive without the love of your mothers to defend you from the brutality of the world.

�Sure you men find your pride in your swords which you won�t let the women carry; if she isn�t allowed to carry a sword, then he would never have to suffer the blow to his dignity of finding out that she might actually be better at swordsmanship than he, should she be given the chance to do so. Sure, speak of your swords. But without a woman�s womb or breasts, those are useless as you yourselves are.�

�Speak for yourself. You bloody women need us men, too,� groused Tirsk.

�Um, maybe she meant both were needed and neither one is more important?� Tirsk and Manke both gave angry looks at Tinli for saying this. �Perhaps not.�

�Besides, what fool would collect sand as he journeyed in the desert? I don�t mean to say having it accumulate on your person, but to have actually to put some in your sack on purpose as you travel so you�ll have more sand than the other travelers who would come before or after you. Why would you be collecting sand in the desert? Because likely someone would tell you it could be made into diamonds or gold. Who�d believe such a thing and do such a thing? A man.�

Tirsk roared. �Come off it, woman! Now don�t you start telling us that that is how the dunes are formed! I will not hear such foolishness!�

An old man came wandering into a small village that resided along a river. Bent with exhaustion, he finally lay down to rest. The people whispered in astonishment at seeing him because he was deathly pale and stank of death. Fearful that he be a beggar with a curse of bad luck about him, they kept shunned him for one entire day. Finally, a young woman came near enough to drop a bowl of water & a small loaf of bread at his side before running back into her home. Her father threw her from his home and she was stoned. The old man had not stirred to drink or to eat.

By the middle of the second day, the people believed he had died. It was then decided that a small contingent of guards should be sent to recover the body and drag it off into the wilderness. As the men lays hands on his ankle to a rope attached to a horse, the old man stirred. Yelping, the guards ran back a dozen paces and huddled together to discuss a new plan of action. One of their number, the youngest & lowest ranking of them, was sent to speak to the old man and ask what he wanted.

Young: �Old man, who are you and where have you come from to bring evil to our home?�

Old:� �I am a son of David & a King of Jerusalem,� the old man replied.

Young: �I have not heard of either man or place you mention. As for yourself, you look like no king I have heard of.�

Old: �Vanity of vanities. All is vanity.� The old man laughed weakly. �No one remembers the past nor will there be anyone in the future to remember.�

Young: �It is said that �there is no new thing under the sun.� Men will work and prosper or they will not work and perish. As it has always been.�

Old: �And thus what has been is that which shall be. That which has been done is that which shall be done among those that come after.�

Young: �Such is the way of the world.�

Old: �It is not the world�s way. Men must make up their own ways.�

Young: �Tell me, what you have done besides be a beggar who brings ill news to those you burden with your presence?�

Old:� �I am a king of a land you have not heard. It is the old story: I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.�

Young: �I assure you we have little use for vanity for her, but I must insist you wash and�make yourself clean. You look & smell of evil.� Leave and keep your filth about you or stay and wash.�

Old: �What is it you do besides wash here?�

Young: �Each man works as needed by the community. Yet we have no work for one as old as you. Truthfully, we are disappointed you hadn�t just died.�


Old:� �I applied my heart to seek and to search out wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven; I have gotten me great wisdom above all that were before me in Jerusalem.�

Young: �Again, I know not of this Jerusalem. I swear to my ears your words are ones of madness. You say you applied your heart and let your body grow weak.�

Old: �So my search to know wisdom, is madness and folly to you?�

Young: �You are only conjurer of lies and deceits. You stand here telling me stories even as other men struggle beneath the son to do honest work in earnest.�

Old: �What profit hath man if the only purpose for his life is to labor under the sun?�

Young: �You see? That is why your children have cast you out. It is you who have betrayed them by not aiding in their works and making a burden of yourself.�

Old: �All is vanity. You build your castles with sand and then the wind blows them away, so you are always striving to build again with sand before the wind destroys your efforts again. To beat it, you must build with stone.�

The two men nodded to each other and stood, bowing, as they accepted congratulations from the gathered audience. They shook hands and the older man lost interest in what the younger man was saying to him as he managed to catch the eye of a young woman smiling at him.

She wasn't her. This girl was older than the one he'd known before. She was taller, fuller in the breast, rounder in the hip. Amy had only twelve or fourteen, a girl just growing into her body. Even at eighteen, she stayed this same way. 

Even at  This other one was a woman already, atleast twenty summers had she known, and her smile was of such cheerfulness that he doubted she had ever seen a single winter in all her years. 

The first girl was older and taller than he, but this other, while her arms and legs seemed quite long and supple, her waist slender, and her breasts quite large, he actually seemed the older and taller one. 

But how could he be? Last he remembered he himself had been sixteen & just shy of it at that. But now he found himself to be as unsteady on his feet as his own grandfather.  Whoever that codger had been... How could that be?

He might of lost track of a year or two in his journeys (three at most), but not sixty or eighty. That was unfathomable. And� there was the matter of his beard and hair to contend with. And his eyes. While his hair as youngster had always been white, it was now a darker color. In fact, it seemed more than content with changing its hue from red to brown to blond to dark gray seemingly of its own will. It never once was white as it should and certainly never black. Thinking this, he brought his left hand up and scratched thoughtfully at the beard that now grew there.

His beard seemed to be content with a color somewhat between blond or brown. His hair being longer and having grown a beard were somewhat surprising, even if he couldn�t make up their minds which color they wanted to be. But what really got to him was how poorly his eyesight had gotten. To such a degree that he now wore a pair of spectacles like his grandfather wore when he was a child.

The younger man glanced to see where the older fellow was looking, then bade farewell as he suddenly thought of somewhere else he had to be. Now that he was alone, she stepped within the circle where the plays were performed each afternoon. �That was quite wonderful, grandfather,� she commented.

The old fellow frowned. �I�m not much older than twenty, if you must know. My name is �Thesus,� not grandfather.� She smiled indulgingly. �Might I ask your name?�

�Amber,� she breathed. She seemed to be glowing with pride but whether from having such a name or because he�d been kind enough to wish to know it he cannot be certain.

�We are well-met, Amber,� Thesus says, holding his hand forward to be shaken.

�We certainly are,� she replies. She bows at the waist, clasps his hand in both of hers, and maneuvers it to grasp her breast. He gasps and takes his hand away from her. She cringes, embarrassed for her forwardness, and clasps her hands above her stomach. Her head hangs shamefully as she stands erect. �My apologies, Lord.� She takes a deep breath, and then slowly exhales it.

�No harm has been done. I had forgotten that hand-shaking is all but unheard of in this region.� He patted the top of her head and she raised her eyes to his, smiling.

�Oh, my Lord.� She laughs fetchingly. �Such welcomes are for the men to practice amongst themselves. Women and children smile to each other. As for a man greeting a woman? She allows him to place his hands wherever he wishes to.�

He says nothing to this. She smiles at his silence and he joins her in laughter.

V

As she walked home later that night, a stern young man emerged and began walking beside her. �Who are you to speak to such an unseemly personage such as him?� It is the young man from the play.

�I am your sister,� she remarked lightly. �As if you should forget. Tis a fact you often remind me so. Is he unseemly because he is an actor, then?�

�You are a young woman and he is nearly the age of your own grand-sire,� her brother�s words were chilled as if from a frost. �As if you hadn�t been aware.�

�With that tone, you sound as if you had seen more winters than he. He may look aged, but he speaks more gaily than thee.� She stopped for a moment to look at him closely. When he stopped as well, she resumed walking. He reached out and grabbed her arm in his hand, pulling her around to face him again. He stared piercingly into her eyes.

He then let her go. �You don�t love him? You don�t hate me for hectoring you?� She shrugs. �Sister, sister, sister! Must you always be so uncooperative? You�ll never have much presence as an actress if you don�t learn to be more emotive.� He shook his head, sighing.

�I find him amusing, tis all. His lechery towards me is really quite welcoming.�

�Amusing in this one particular incidence?� He looks at her, completely flabbergasted. �Forgive my surprise, but you aren�t usually flattered...�

�He asked me my name,� she says as if the implication was obvious. �He didn�t attempt to have his way with me the moment he saw me. Most men focus solely upon using me to satisfy their own urges and consider introductions to be a hindrance. I cannot tell you how frustrating it is to have a man on top of me and not knowing the man�s name...�

�I certainly would rather not here you describe such a thing in detail!�

�... knowing that he doesn�t even know my name,� she continues as if he hadn�t interrupted. �Knowing that he identifies me to his friends with such unflattering nicknames.�

�But you don�t know the names of such men, either, now do you?�

�I do. The women tell each other the names of the men we are with. We collectively know all the names of the men and watch what each man�s tastes are so we may warn each other.�

�And you believe this man to be different because he told you his name and he wanted to know yours?�

She stops and glares at him defiantly. �I don�t know your name, brother.�

Chastened, he lowers his head. �Okay, I concede your point. You aren�t actually my sister.� Sighs. �Forgive a eunuch for being unaware of how such games between men and women are played.�

�Oh, don�t be so sad now, you wonderful lad,� she holds his hand consolingly.

�If you hadn�t said �now,� the couplet would have been perfect,� he smiles half-heartedly.

�We don�t have to perfect, sweets,� she pats the back of the hand she�s holding. �We just have to breathe and accept that we are not as terribly imperfect as the others.�

�I wonder,� he asks. �Now should we exchange names?�

�It wouldn�t be fair because you haven�t got one of your own.�

�Oh, that is correct.�


VI

It is the following morning, after they awake in each other�s arms that Ambers asks Thesus if he�d loved another woman. The question is so sudden that at first doesn�t grasp their meaning. �I slept well,� he says, thinking she�d asked him how well he�d slept.

�Oh, they couldn�t have been that boring.�

�They who?�

�The women you slept with.�

Puzzled, he considers. �I think you are putting a different meaning on that word than I am familiar with.�

�Were I not so mannerly, I could say I imagine you�ve rutted with pigs in a sty.� Her eyes twinkle. �I could use more colorful language if you wanted me to.�

�I would rather you didn�t, but I am not your master. I am but a humble man.�

�That�s almost beyond imagination --- a man being humble.� She pokes him. �You�re masterful at being humble.� Pinches his stomach. �One of the reasons that I love you.�

�Can we stop evading the issue here? What causes you to ask me about my �sleeping� habits?� He raises an eyebrow. �We haven�t actually done anything. I remember I lay down here to get some rest and when I wake up, you�re lying here next to me and asking questions.�

�Clearly I remind you some girl you used to know. I could see it in your eyes the moment we met. Are you perhaps disappointed that I�m not who you thought I was?�

�You couldn�t be her.� He shudders. �She died.� He begins to shiver and passes out.

VII

He found himself standing in a place where he�d been before, beyond the perimeter of a fence. A long line of people stand waiting patiently in order to enter something behind him. He knew not because he didn�t spare a glance behind. Instead, he stared straight ahead as he had done that day many long years ago at what was approaching.

The crowds parted, their places in line forgotten in their mass revulsion for the horrible sight which they saw approaching them. A broken and pathetic man sat in the saddle of a starved horse, swaying lifelessly as the horse walked. Pale horse with even paler rider, he stank of death; that is, of stagnant earth from the depths of a graveyard. He looked like the embodiment of death unhooded and astride a dying horse. His face was torn off and bloodied, revealing his skull from his forehead to the hollows of his eyes. In deed, his eyes were plastered shut from dried blood and he was effectively blind. He wore a soldier's clothes which were a little too big of him or he had simply wasted away from starvation along the long road he had traveled. His legs were bandaged in several places and one arm had been broken; it was held across his chest in a crude sling. His hair was shaped in unflattering arrangements and he bled from a wound on the crown of his head, which was also bandaged. It was the man whose grave he�d marked with the word �friend� come back from the dead.

IX

Thesus awoke this time, shrieking in fear.

He was in a new place now, lying in a bed. He felt the covers wrapped around his shoulders, up to his neck. He was tucked in. He squirmed. He�d never liked being tucked in. It was dark in this room. The door opened a crack...

X

He stirred from his dreamless sleep and looked across to the aged person lying in the northwest corner of the room. He rolled over from his stomach onto his back. The noise that had awakened him wasn�t coming from the sleeping old man. Well, it probably wasn�t the snoring and groaning and moaning and even the shouted expletives in a dialect that was so strange to his young ears that he wasn�t sure if it was spoken or the sound of a pig farting. This old cuss sure made a lot of disgusting noises when he slept. Completely unlike his grandfather. His grandmother always slept a soundless sleep� did he have a grandfather? Why was he sleeping in a strange bed? Why was he sharing a room with an old man who snored loudly? These questions troubled him.

His eyes shifted from the old man to his own toes which had extricated themselves from the suffocating depths of the blanket. Whether or not he had a grandfather of his own, he was sure his own grandfather wasn�t a gross noisome beast like his current roommate. In the dark of early dawn, he smiled for the first genuine time since he had shared a bed with the rambunctious McDonald twins. And now who were the McDonald twins? Could it be that he was getting senile in his old age? It suddenly occurred to him that he shouldn�t be wondering about his own grandfather, but if he were someone�s grandfather. He certainly was old enough to be somebody�s grampy. Imagine... here he lies, not being able to sleep, and thinking about a pair of twins he can�t even remember a thing about!

Before he could wonder more about them, a voice spoke from outside the door and he realized what had wakened him up.

"Hello there."

It wasn't a voice he heard before. Curiosity might have caused him to look up to see who was speaking, but he wasn't in a very curious mood. He rubbed his eyes.

"Well, you're a rude little boy aren't you?" The door had been opened just a crack, bringing a small sliver of light into the room in which he was hiding. He guessed that the speaker was carrying a lantern, so that must mean it wasn't night. There weren't any windows in the room, so it would be dark any way even if it were still day time. He could tell that it was a lantern because the light it gave was somehow insubstantial... it pulsated... it didn't feel cheerful. Maybe the light was mocking him?

"You're the one who forgot to knock," he observed.

The stranger laughed. The door opened wider.

"Could you close that door?" He wanted to tell this person, whoever they were, that he didn't want company. Would have insisted that they leave. But he somehow couldn't. He'd already been accused of being rude, so he didn't want to prove this person right.

The door closed, but the person with the lantern had already stepped inside the room. The figure holding the lantern laughed mischievously. At this moment, his room-mate eyes sprang open and he sat bolt upright with a curse and a loud, noxious fart that sounded like a trumpet flourish. The intruder gasped (whether from his waking or from the sound or smell of the flatulence cannot be told), and then a strange cloud of smoke hit whatshisname�s face just as he turned to face the intruder.

Jump from his own bed, somehow managed to trip in the covers and fell to his hands and knees.� And he realized that it wasn�t smoke, it was sand, because a handful of it was thrown into his face as well. They both lay howling in pain and writhing, trying to rub the sand from their eyes, as the intruder ran straight for the door and out.



Thesus lay on the floor, rolling about and howling in pain. The door opened, Amber came rushing in. She grabbed him by the shoulders. �Thesus! Thesus!� she whispered urgently. �Why are you on the floor? Are you in pain?�

�There�s sand in my eyes!� he yelled, rubbing at them.

�Let me see!� She pulled his hands away from his eyes and felt them with her own. �I feel nothing. There is no sand. Your face is clean except for your tears.�

Thesus looked at her, his vision blurred. Somehow he thought what he was seeing should be tinged red, but couldn�t remember why. He blinked away the tears. �Ask him!� he yelled, pointing to where his snoring room-mate had been sleeping. He glances over, and sees there is no other bed. He�d been lying in the only bed in the small room. No, not a room. It was a simple hut. The floor had a rug, the rest was wood. Why was he thinking there should be things growing here and the walls should be made of glass? �No one there... but I was sleeping in a room with someone else. Another old man like me... he was sleeping in a bed over there.� He pointed vaguely this time, uncertain of his own recollection. �I... saw the door open... someone was talking to me... she came in and woke up the other man up... she threw sand in our faces and ran out...�

�Thesus, please stop saying these things!� she whispered urgently. �I have been sleeping out on the floor while you were in my bed. I was worried for you. Now you wake and tell me such things I can only think to be madness. Please don�t say... don�t say...�

�Don�t say what?� he asked in a whisper. If he hadn�t already been over-burdened by questions, now he must worry why she seemed so determined to be quiet. She hadn�t even asked him to whisper...

�Please don�t say I am falling in love with a mad man.� Having said these words, she continued on without waiting for his reply. He couldn�t have thought of one in any case. �I opened the door a crack to check on you. You tossed a little in your sleep, and then dozed off again. I didn�t want to wake you. Now I find you raving about... you must have been dreaming.�

�I know not if they were a memory or I was remembering something from my past.�

She smiled slyly. �Oh, your past. Shame that you cannot tell me stories now once you finally regain somewhat of your wits & your memory. Now is the time to sleep.� She rises. �I cannot be alone this near to a bed with you.� She brushes herself off. �People will talk. Now, I hope you enjoy sleeping comfortably while I lay outside on the ground.� She moves to leave.

�No, no. It is your bed.� He rises. �You sleep here.� He gets up, walks across the room, and puts his hand on the door knob. She stops him. The look in her eyes stops him from speaking. They walk outside together.

Groupings of men and women are scattered around the tent. �Have you consecrated?� one man asks. Thesus shakes his head no. Five men shrug as if in disgust and walk off. The women remain, along with one man. The stragglers remain riveted. They at least seem to realize that there are more things to be curious about besides matters of the flesh.

�He is prepared to speak,� Amber announces. They speak the next part in unison with her, �And we are prepared to listen.� After a beat, the man preens, �eagerly.�

�I know not what is I may tell you,� Thesus answers. �What would you know?
I am but a man who has traveled. Surely you do not expect every traveler to have told tale of himself. Not all men are boasters of their own deeds.�

�Well, we aren�t asking you to boast,� says one of the women. Her hair is golden. Her voice is that of burnished brass. �In troth we are glad that you aren�t. So of course our interest is the greater for it.�

�Please. Forgive the impertinence of an old man, but how is it that your voice is so rough, young lady?�

�You won�t be so easily be reprieved as you would wish, beloved,� Amber purrs.

�Forgive me. Sleeping outside of your own doors must have given you a cold.� 
     
�I am not sick, sir. Outside my own doors perhaps, but I was inside another�s doors,� at this she smiles. �And if I could truly say this, I have been inside another�s drawers.� 
     
�You�ve� oh. I have forgotten what you have said of the customs of this town.� He looks at her sheepishly, wondering what exactly is going on here. 
     
This time she laughs. �Do not wonder too much what an unmarried woman in our village might be doing while an old man such as you stirs in the sleep of damned.� 
     
�I am not damned,� he insists.
     
She doesn�t laugh this time, just strikes him a back-handed blow. �All of us are damned since HE left us at the mercy of the OTHER.� 

�HE? You mean you don�t know this person�s name?�

�The white haired boy. We don�t speak his name because the Other forbids it. The other is a usurper and evil creature. We hadn�t appreciated the white haired one. Some of us feared him, in fact.� 

Amused, Thesus asked, �Where do you think he�s gone to?�

�Wipe that smile from your face!� She made as if to strike him again, but didn�t. �He ran away from us after killing some drunken lout. That happened a very long time ago.�

Thesus doubted it had happened very long ago. But then again, there was the matter of his own difficulty in guessing his own age to take into consideration. Had he really been gone so long? Why couldn�t he remember what he�d done during that time away? And why did this young lady look so much like that other girl from his past? He sighed wearily. �Let me sleep, please,� he asked.

She looked at him fiercely for a moment. As if to be tired after hearing such news were some kind of effrontery. But she decided to forgive him. He was an old fellow in poor health. She doubted he�d remember any of their discussion later on anyway.

She stood and walked out the door. 

IX


The news troubled him, but his sleep this time was dreamless. He was even more confused. Had he been sleeping the whole time like Rip Van Wrinkle? Had the Darkling come back in the interim and become somehow more powerful? Or was it some greater evil that he must fear? He turned over in bed and faced the wall. That was no help. He almost wished for the madness he had been feeling for the past few weeks to overcome him again. At least then he wouldn't be responsible for anything further to come. He rubbed sweat from his brow. The stress of just trying to get some sleep in his own sick bed was driving him nuts with anxiety. 

But it was her smiling face that brought him clarity each day & night between his dreamt horrors. But she didn�t seem to be taking as much pleasure from seeing his face it seemed. One morning he asked her. This is how she replied: 

�For I cannot judge how old you are. I want to kiss you sometimes because you look young & desirable to me, even if a bit bushy about the face.�

He laughed. �So I look like shrubbery to you. Perhaps I should shear this beard from my face. It is very uncomfortable let me comment.�

�No, you don�t have to. Other times you look like my father� and the tears just come to my eyes but I dare not let them be shed in your presence. I don�t want you seeing my crying.� She put a hand to her mouth as if surprised the words had been said from her own lips. 

�How often had he seen you cry?� he asked. �Before you answer that, is he in his grave?�

�I wouldn�t know.� She smiled a wan smile. �I mean I do not know if he is in his grave. He could have gotten out. But any how, since he had caused those tears, I never could judge if he liked seeing them or not. Oh, �stop crying� he�d say. But did he really mean it? � I do not know why I am saying things to my patient.� 

He looked at her for such a long time that she stepped to the wash basin & poured its contents onto his face. He laughed. �I�m sorry but I was just thinking of my changling ways!�

She laughed with him. �Your what now?�

�You wish to kiss me sometimes when I look young & others, you feel you wish to cry at my old face.� 

�Oh, but it isn�t just your face. It is your hands as well. When you�ve slept well, you have strong hands; the hands of a good man. At others, well, you have trouble feeding yourself because those hands of yours have got all rheumatized.� 

His silence wasn�t as long this time. �They change so?�

�Aye.� She nodded. �You no longer look of death, but you don�t seem to making any progress I can discern.� 

But she was speaking to him as he slept. She raised a hand as if to strike & awaken him but thought better of it. He was sick. Strange, to be sure, but sick on top of that. What other tricks did this magician know? She was sure he would tell her once he felt better. Patience, her mother spoke from the ethereal realm beyond ours, Patience my little one. Your treat will be sweeter the more patient you are. 

Easy for dead mothers to speak of patience, she thought.

As she left his tent... her tent... she had to remember it was HER tent & not his, she glanced at the looks strangers were giving her. Let them think she was still that strumpet. They wouldn't believe her if she told them what he was really... no.... they wouldn't think he was their savior. She knew he was, for surely a creature of magic like him would have been able to grow old fast. 

Purely the whim of a child it was! To want to be older so badly that he aged himself fifty years too much. Stupid! But at least it disguised him. Thank the maker for that. No, thank the Raven for that.

She had her own savior. At least he himself was smart enough to only age half that of his brother's age. Not only that, but to... she mustn't think of it. He'd be angry if anyone knew if he was the Eunuch without a name. The EWAM. Secretly she named him Geoffrey. One time he'd told her of people who worshiped a stupid giraffe (whatever that was) and they practiced improper grammar. She knew what grammar was and because she was stupid (her father always told her that) & also because she worshiped the Raven, she called him �Geoffrey� in her secret thoughts. At least that's what she called his alternate form. 

She who was once daddy's Mel-Annie & who was now the Raven's secret spy walked confidently despite the looks she got. Half of the men here had seen her naked & all of the women have had their husbands describe her naked but yet hadn't seen her that way. And they weren't going to.

And if legends were true, the people of Eden used to bathe in public! Pah! In a giant bathhouse, even! Absurd! Nobody could afford to heat an entire public pool, so it must be a lie. Such immodesty! And to give your daughters' virginity away freely just for a stupid harvest! Disgusting!

Now there's a thought. She'd given hers to the Raven. When her body was sixteen. But she hadn't seen sixteen summers & she loved how he looked at her, this �Thesus,� because she looked like that stupid Amy-girl he'd loved when he was younger. The Raven's magic was splendid! It would be immodest to say how many years he'd sped up her bodily development! 

It's great, Mel-Annie thought. To be eight & have BREASTS and be taller than any other girl her age ever could be. She smiled for reasons only she would know. She smiled so much people believed, like her father did, that she was stupid. She could read these thoughts off people's faces & how they looked at her. 

But the Raven's little-big-girl was no fool. Let that Thesus think Amber was a nurse & let the people think she was still a Man-Eater.

The Crime Scene Has Been Tainted.

�So, you�re saying he what? He was gray? He had gills?
Fuck, that�s hard for me to understand. Was he wearing a scuba mask? I don�t see a fucking fishing boat here. This is your apartment, miss, I don�t see anything here that reminds me of a damn shark. I heard that alligators are in the sewers? Did one climb out and bite you on the ass? Did a shark bite you? Looks like you�ve got all your arms and legs.�

�No, listen. I said, �it was like Jaws.� Not in the sense that it was anything like a shark. The guy had nothing to do with a damn shark.�

�You weren�t even swimming, either. You got a shower back there, but no bath tub. And you�ve got a nice assortment of rubber ducks back there. Oh, I�m sorry, not rubber ducks, but rubber dicks.�

�Jealous because you only have the one? Rubber dick I mean. Why don�t you take it out of your ass and shove it in your mouth so you can shut up for a fucking minute?�

Valley found himself thinking of a movie. It wasn�t Jaws he thought about, but Basic Instinct. But this chick wasn�t any thing like Sharon Stone. First of all, instead of being blond, this chick was a brunette. She had short hair, cut like a guy�s. Shit, she looked like �just one of the guys� if all you saw was her hair. But, oh man, if you managed to look at anything else, man, you really were sure this was a woman. One hell of a woman, too. There she sat, telling Berk to shut the fuck up, and she wasn�t wearing any clothes. Well, she did have on a pair of stockings and some high heals, but that was it. Apart from that, the only other thing covering her was that towel that she had on over her shoulders. Her hair was wet, so she occasionally lifted up the towel to wipe the water off it. Valley could sympathize with her, but she still got him. Got him feeling for her a way he�d been told he shouldn�t. Damn, she had a nice rack. Just huge, so big that Valley kind of worried that it might hurt her back when she walked. He thought about asking her what bra size she had and decided against it. Even if he could somehow work that into sounding like a legitimate question --- a question he�s supposed to ask ---, he doubted she had ever worn one. 

The thing that reminded Valley about that movie was her... Damn, he couldn�t think of way to put it which wouldn�t make him sick enough to puke. He�d never said any of the obscene words in his life (had heard it called a million disgusting things) and even the �nice� things it was called sounded dirty. Regardless of what he could think of calling it, she covered it with only her hands. Both hands clasping each other, except when she shook a fist at Berk or when she shrugged. Valley loved the shrug. When she did that, both hands went up, not just one. He got to see the whole works when she shrugged and it even moved.

�� You see?�

�Yes, I do, miss. We see a whole fucking lot. Davie here probably is seeing more of you than he�d ever seen of a woman in his life. I mean, I doubt this is the first time he�d ever seen a naked woman, but he�s acting as if this were the first time he�d seen one seeing him seeing her.� Berk. Fucking Berk making fun of him again.
     
�That�s David Valley, please. Call me that and I�ll call you �Tim Berk.� Hell, I might even call you �Timothy.� But you call me anything other than �David� or �Valley,� and I�ll call you much worse.�

Berk smiles. �You wanna show her your fig leaf, David?�

Valley ignores that. �In what way did you mean that, �you see�?� he asks her, hoping she wasn�t asking him if he liked what he saw. He felt that if she had been, then he might just vomit all over that damp boy�s hair of hers and she�d have to take another shower. He might even stay to watch� Call it his civic duty to help her wash his puke out of her hair and clean it off her back. He�d love to get a look at what her ass looked like.

�I didn�t have a chance to say what I meant before this asshole interrupted. I was saying, �you see,� and before I could continue, Old Faithful decided to ejaculate again. But, looking at him, I guess only his mouth could do that. He just talks so fucking much because his little buddy is shriveled little interrogatory. No exclamations out of this one. Just questions nobody wants to answer. Questions like, �why can�t I get the damn thing to stand up on it�s own?� I bet he squats when he pees.�

�He sure does,� answers one of the other guys. Valley doesn�t know his name, but he�s sure it�s safe to say he can tell him and the other guy who�s name he can�t remember apart. The one who just said something Valley had wanted to say is black. The other guy, well, it�s safe to say he isn�t. Funny. Three words. So far, in the hour they�ve been here, one of them finally said something. And with those three words, Valley was sure of two things. The first that was he liked this one. This brother. And the other was that the other one must be either ten times hornier than Valley himself was, or just simply dead. He was sure if he touched that guy, he might just fall over backwards, as rigid as he�d been chiseled from stone. That brought a smile to his face. Saying a guy as fat as that was �chiseled� had to be a great joke. 

Berk sneered. He didn�t look at the black guy, but he stared right at the smile on Valley�s face. Valley smiled again, and pointed at the wooden Indian over there standing next to the black guy he liked. Berk walked right up to the fat guy and slapped him in the face. Sure enough, the big bastard fainted.

No statue this one. He proved to have far less grace. He fell back, slammed the back of his head against the book case (a book case that sported no books, but a healthy collection of the articles that Berk had mentioned was in the bathroom), fell forward, and landed with head in the chick�s lap. She then kicked him in his balls and threw him down to the floor. Valley had to envy the guy. Heck, he even respected him a little. Even unconscious, he still got a chance to give her a big kiss down there. And, despite the fact she�d kicked him so hard that his balls must of detonated with pain, the guy lay there, smiling.

�Anyone, you see, I�m not saying the guy was a shark. I�m just saying that you remember when the girl got attacked? She got shaken around like a goddamn rag doll and she didn�t see what was doing it to her? Like that. Goddamn rag doll.�

�You didn�t see him?� Berk, oh fuck, that kick must of scared him, because Berk was actually writing this down. He�d suddenly dropped the pig act and was acting like he was doing his job. And forget him being a cop. This guy was suddenly a fucking police officer.

�No, I didn�t see him. Didn�t see his face. Didn�t see him at all. But I sure as hell felt it.�

�You weren�t awake during this?� Writing it down.

�I was awake.�

�He blindfold you?�

�No.�

�So how come you didn�t see him? You wear glasses?�

�Yes, but I was wearing them when it happened.� She actually reaches behind Valley, leaning forward in the bed, touching her lips to his� to him� then pulls back her arm with a pair of glasses in her hand. She puts them on. �I just didn�t want to see that ugly face of yours,� she says, and smiles at Berk.

Berk writes this down. Valley would be goddamned if he didn�t it write in third person as if she hadn�t insulted him. Something like, �didn�t want to see Berk�s �ugly face.��

�I was on the phone at the time, just got out of the shower and I was calling my sister. Stupid fucking bitch mentioned her probably being pregnant. Fuck. Here I�m working for three years, not a goddamn one of them wanted to wear a damn glove, and the stupid bitch gets herself knocked up by that fucking retard boyfriend of hers. KIDS! Any way, I was talking and then all of a sudden, I get thrown right across the room and land in the bed.�

�What time was this?�

�12:01am.�

�When was this finished?�

�12:01.�

�Uh, that fast? Or that slow?�

�One second. Not twelve hours. After it happened, I asked Steph if she�d heard anything weird. She said she was talking, I�d said �Oh!� and that was it. Didn�t notice anything.�

�Oh?�

�Yep. I get raped by the fucking Flash and she thinks I�m saying �Oh!� Damn, I wish they were all that quick. Average jerk wants to try for fifteen minutes even though he�s done way before that. Just under one second of work, and, well, then that.� She says this, then points at the nightstand by the bed. On it, there�s the most money Valley had ever seen in his life. He was also pretty sure that it wasn�t the most this hooker had seen. Sure, when she�d been a waitress, it would have been. But now, with her current employment, he guessed she spent that much on just a couple of those toys of hers. One of them had a handle resembling a light saber right outta Star Wars. And if that damn thing didn�t glow in the dark, well, then Valley�s new friend over there was probably just a white guy pretending to be black.

He sat in a furnace. He crouched in a gathering of flames so hot that they burned as they were a small pocket of hell upon the earth. He did not notice the fire, though. It did not burn him, nor did his face look as if he realized where he sat. He seemed as casual as if he�d been simply perched in the midst of a warm bath tub full of tepid water rather than in an inferno. 

His hands clasped his knees and the wrists were slit with thunder bolts of incisions and blood poured freely into his lap. Once in a while, he would hold his flayed wrists to his lips and drink of his own blood. The blood flowed and was endless, an ocean of scarlet stuff that was boiled by the flames as it rested in his lap. The hairs all over his body were aflame as well, as was the hair on his head. But, instead of screams of pain, his lips only loosed giggles of satisfaction and maniacal bouts of laughter. In between giggles and laughter, he chanted the same fragment of words incessantly.

�Raven�s Feather from unwholesome fen� Raven�s Feather from unwholesome fen� Raven�s Feather from unwholesome fen� Raven�s Feather from unwholesome fen� Raven�s Feather from unwholesome fen� Raven�s Feather from unwholesome fen��

Cackling with laughter, seated casually in an inferno of flames that did not burn him, bleeding profusely from the wrists, genitals boiling in blood, he chanted.

He stared straight up towards the ceiling. Upon it, he�d drawn a five-pointed star --- a pentagram --- with his own blood, but it wasn�t long before he saw through the ceiling, though the pentagram stayed in his vision (reflecting the flames that did not burn him) and he could see the night beyond and the moons above him in the dark.

XIII

Words. He closes in his eyes and hears words in his ears. Words being spoken to him. �she looked like �just one of the guys� if all you saw was.� Raven�s Feather laughed harder as he released the words were not spoken to him, but were actually another man�s thoughts. Thinking of him. No. Thinking of a woman in whose body he now resided. He opened the woman�s eyes while his own stayed firmly shut. He opened her eyes and saw another world. 

Men were standing around the woman where she sat. One of them was staring intently at her hair and his thoughts were heard clearly as if spoken, and more, what he could see --- was seeing --- was painted on his forehead as if it were a living tattoo.  �But, oh man, if you managed to look at anything else, man, you really were sure this was a woman. One hell of a woman, too.�

The man standing to the staring man�s left was speaking to the woman and her head moved to face him. She saw her own face on his mind. Only her face. He was looking at nothing else but her face, centering his gaze on her eyes. 

The woman (�did have on a pair of stockings and some high�) lifted a hand to her face, saw her own reflection (�had a nice rack. Just huge, so big�) in the other man�s mind do the same thing. The hair was very short, as the first man had thought. From the rambling of his thoughts, she knew he was staring at her breasts even though she didn�t bother to check to see if his mind showed them. (�might hurt her back�). She laughed at this one, not even guessing what he might of meant by that. She sensed he liked it when she laughed, but he �loved the shrug.� She waved at the other man, smiling as she waved back in his mind.

She couldn�t sense the other mens� thoughts. They weren�t a direct chain of thoughts organized as if spoken, but more like pictures of what these men wished to perform with her, regardless if she wanted to or not. Especially if she didn�t. But she wanted to.

She turned to the first man, saw her breasts focused intently upon his mind, and she raised his hands to them, caressed her own breasts. His eyes widened and his mouth fell open. Then, she froze all of them still with a word.

And they were all frozen as if statues, staring at the bed where she sat even as she got up from it. Not even their mind pictures changed. For all intents and purposes, they only saw her sitting in the bed and not walking across the room. She went to the first man, kneeled before his rigid body, and took his pants off. She then crawled behind him, let one hand sneak in front and grab him in the center of his being (between his legs) for a moment to make sure he was ready for what she wanted him to do, then pushed him. He fell over as his he were a statue over-turned on his pedestal and his face fell into the pillows where she had sat. 

She climbed beneath his frozen body again, put only the part of him that she had willed back to life inside of herself, then writhed and floundered beneath him. She did this underneath him for what could have been called days had not she frozen the entire world in place and it wasn�t only until she had been satiated a thousand times or more that she finished with him. She then pulled his pants back up, stood him back him where he�d been, and returned to her place on the bed.

Then she willed the world to unfreeze. He coerced the woman into speaking just two words: �� You see?�

�Yes, I do, miss. We see a whole fucking lot,� the other man was saying. The thing inside her asked her what he was and she answered with three words in her thoughts: �cop, fucking asshole.� The thing inside her laughed. �Maybe he�s just jealous,� it said. �Jealous of what?� the woman�s thoughts asked it, but it would not answer.

 The �fucking asshole� of a �cop� continued: �Davie here probably is seeing more of you than he�d ever seen of a woman in his life. I mean, I doubt this is the first time he�d ever seen a naked woman, but he�s acting as if this were the first time he�d seen one seeing him seeing her.� 

�Berk, the first man�s thoughts said. �Fucking Berk making fun of me again.� But he kept these to himself and only the thing in the woman heard him. He spoke aloud instead: �That�s David Valley, please. Call me that and I�ll call you �Tim Berk.� Hell, I might even call you �Timothy.� But you call me anything other than �David� or �Valley,� and I�ll call you much worse.�

Berk smiles. �You wanna show her your fig leaf, David?� At that, the woman looked at him, saw naked man whose genitals discreetly covered with a leaf. Ah. This one was so boring, he even censored his own thoughts.

Valley ignores that. �In what way did you mean that, �you see�?� he asks her. She can clearing read his thoughts: �clean it off her back. He�d love to get a look at what her ass looked like.� 

The thing inside of the woman is happily surprised as the woman speaks, sharing in the conversation: �I didn�t have a chance to say what I meant before this asshole interrupted. I was saying, �you see,� and before I could continue, Old Faithful decided to ejaculate again. But, looking at him, I guess only his mouth could do that. He just talks so fucking much because his little buddy is shriveled little interrogatory. No exclamations out of this one. Just questions nobody wants to answer. Questions like, �why can�t I get the damn thing to stand up on it�s own?� I bet he squats when he pees.�

�He sure does,� answers a man with very dark, brown skin. She searches in Valley�s mind and only comes up with the words �black guy.� 

She looks into the dark skinned man�s mind, can only find a picture of what he wants to do to her; something his mind insists on calling �doggie-style.� Other than that, only Cassius Clay seems to be the only name his mind, not even a hint of whether or not he himself is this Clay man. �Then again,� says the thing in the woman�s mind, �these are all my Clay Men!� She freezes time again while the men are in the midst of a bitter silence. She goes to Cassius, does the same thing she had done with the first man, only this time she faces away from him and bends at the waist. She forces him into her and does it like a �doggie� would to him as he stands there frozen, laughing at the joke he�d told about Berk.

When finished with the experiment, she sets him to rights and then starts to walk back to the bed. On her way, she stops. She looks at Berk. Smiling, she takes a pad of paper from a pocket in his pants and places it and a pen into his hands. She then shoots him pictures of her previous encounters with his fellows into his mind and commands him to draw them on the pad of paper. The command given, she sits down again. Unfreezes.

Valley thinks: �Saying a guy as fat as that was �chiseled� had to be a great joke.� She looks up at his face, sees the face of the �tub of lard� he�s looking at in his mind and seriously doubts she�d want to do anything to him. The man is so ugly the only thing she would want to do to him is kill him. 

Berk sneered. He didn�t look at the black guy, but he stared right at the smile on Valley�s face. Valley smiled again, and pointed at the wooden Indian over there standing next to the black guy he liked. Berk walked right up to the fat guy and slapped him in the face. Sure enough, the big bastard fainted. Freeze.

The woman laughs in incredible good humor. She hadn�t told Berk to do that, but she now wishes she did. She turns her gaze to the first man and to the dark skinned man. She has claimed their souls as completely as she had claimed the woman in which she now breathed. She kept their minds frozen and blinded their eyes, but brought them entirely to life from their necks down. She makes them attack the fat man. Fists slam into his stomach a hundred times. Feet impact with his genitals dozens of times. They break his arms for her and she laughs. They hold him up, one man behind and the other in front, both pairs of hands strangling the fat man by his throat. Four pairs of hands lift him up and slam his head on the ceiling four scores of times. Four hands break his neck. They throw him against the wall and all freeze once more.

The fat man is as good as dead the very instant that she returns him to himself. She has the two men return to their places and the fat man slammed the back of his head against the book case fell forward (the vertebrae in his neck finally emitting the SNAP of his spine being broken), and landed with head in the chick�s lap. She then kicked him in his balls and threw him down to the floor. 

And, despite the fact she�d kicked him so hard that his balls must of detonated with pain, the guy lay there, smiling.

The woman now speaks again: �Any way, you see, I�m not saying the guy was a shark. I�m just saying that you remember when the girl got attacked? She got shaken around like a goddamn rag doll and she didn�t see what was doing it to her? Like that. Goddamn rag doll.�

�You didn�t see him?�  Valley�s thoughts: �Berk, oh fuck, that kick must of scared him, because Berk was actually writing this down.� The woman considered correcting him, but was delighted with look of shock in Berk�s eyes as drew those awful pictures in that note book of his completely without his volition.

�No, I didn�t see him. Didn�t see his face. Didn�t see him at all. But I sure as hell felt it.� Raven�s Feather laughs. �I hope you felt what you just did to these men,� he says to her before he leaves.

As the cops leave, a homeless woman busily inspecting a dumpster suddenly stops what she is doing. She leaps out of the dumpster and walks shakily to the edge of the alley. She quietly mutters to herself, �Please! I am not of your ilk, Satan� and then subsides. 

Her eyes move of their own volition, picking out three men in plainclothes. They are all poorly dressed. She can tell just by looking at them that they are detectives of some sort. She can smell the stench of bacon upon them as easily as she smells the cheap cologne they all wear. She tries to pull herself back into the shadows more but instead walks towards the detectives. She stops, standing across the street from them.

A million miles away, her controllers confer. �We have an Undesirable,� speaks one person. �We are aware of this, Alphie,� is the reply. 

Alphie makes a sound of disgust.  

�Report, Alphie.�

�The old broad wet herself is all.�

�We are not amused, Alphie. She is of no consequence. Stick to the details.�

�Well, the Undesirable seems highly skilled. We felt a time flux. Not sure how long it lasted or what was done.�

�Have you located the Undesirable?�

�He�s not one of ours. And I�ll be damned if I can figure out his signature. You know I�m good at that sort of thing.�

�Cut the crap, Alphie. No bragging.�

�My apologies. I don�t feel this one is of this world. I�m getting a real occult feel from it.�

�We�ve discussed this, Alphie. There are no parallel universes or wormholes. Our Undie is of this world. We have to find him & incorporate him into our way of doing things.� 

�Yes, I know. Otherwise he�s a threat to National security.�

�Exactly, Alphie.�

�Uh� bad news.�

�What, Alphie.�

�I�ve lost the vital signs of the fourth detective to enter the residence. He still hasn�t left the apartment.�

�Shit, Alphie.�

�Why not? This broad�s already soiled herself.� 

�That isn�t what we met, Alphie. Put her back where you found her and calm  her down if you have to.�

�Acknowledged.� The old woman gingerly about-faces. The detectives still noticed her. She gratefully walks back into the alley where she�d come from. Before she reaches the dumpster, she loudly shouts, �Praise you, Jesus, for rescuing me!�

Valley & Berk share a look. Their black counterpart has gone back inside to retrieve Sleeping Beauty. They haven�t yet realized how deeply in trouble they are yet. But they soon will. 


Valley was the first to re-enter the residence. It turned out the black detective's name was Baker. Baker  had gone back in expecting to find his sad sack of partner trying to get the whore to give him a freebie. He wouldn't pay for anything if he could weasel his way around a bill. Turns out they found the fourth man was very dead. 

The whore herself was hanging from the shower head from a pair of her own panties. An autopsy performed on her body revealed that almost all of the men who'd interrogated her had somehow taken turns with the woman. Each man denied it. One of the deceased, Jannels, had recorded the whole proceeding with a mini-cassette recorder. Each man testified that none of the lewd comments spoken or the love-making noises on the tape were made by 
themselves. 

The story made the  papers briefly but as with all things that happen in this Rotten Apple of ours, it was soon forgotten. One thing was certain... Raven's Feather had transgressed The Divide.

Voices in the dark of the abyss:

�I have a concern, Momma Bear.�

�What is you concern, Goldilocks?� 

A stream of images: sequential close-ups of Berk, Valley, Jannels, & Baker. 

Upon closer reflection they might have proven to be the men�s driver�s licenses. Jannel�s face is crossed out with red ink. The others are circled with green marker.

Another stream of images: the crime scene photos. A picture of the victim is even featured. It might even be a magazine pin-up.  

�Your concern is valid, Goldilocks.� 

�Momma!!�

�Yes, Little Bear One?�

�I can�t tell who is talking!�

�Use tags, Poppa Bear.�

�Yes, Momma Bear. I forgot we could do that.� 

LB1: �Momma Bear, this is serious! We can�t let a former bunny�s death be 
blamed upon our own police force.� 

GDL: �She wasn�t that good of a model. She was a page seven girl. Bikini shoot. Five years ago.� 

PB: �Good memory, Goldilocks.� 

GDL: �I have a good memory for the maBEEP!�

MB: �Don�t swear, Goldilocks! Bad boy!�

GDL: �I don�t see how that computes. I am officially designated Fem for this mission.� 

MB: �Don�t argue semantics, Goldilocks!!!�

GDL: �My bad, Momma Bear.� 

MB: �Momma spank!� 

Goldilocks swears. Somewhere in the south east of the city, a waitress rubs away the pain in her tush. Her supervisor yells at her. 

�Francine!!! Pick that crap up offa the floor!!! I told you IGNORE it when the customers pinch that sweet rump of yers!�

�My rump is mine and mine alone, Paulie. I quit.� Francine takes off her apron.

�Good luck finding a damn job in this neighborhood if you do, Doll Face!� Paulie puts his fists on his hips. It�s a pose of arrogance he�s used many times when talking to the goils. He wouldn�t dare do that to his wife. 

Francine drops the apron & walks out of the diner.

Francine imagines how great it would feel to kick this slime bag in the nether-regions but decides not to. It would just make it harder to find a job if she were charged with assault. And he would charge her. She�d be lucky to get a last paycheck out of him even. Cup a noodle for her for the rest of the week it seems�

Little Bear One snickers. Of course Momma Bear doesn�t hurt him. He�s one of her favorites. She knew not why & knew not how, but he was.

Amber woke him as usual. He wondered about her lack of shyness of a sudden. She woke him while she wore no clothes and she made no attempts to disguise her pleasure at his surprise. Her belly was swollen with child. He expressed shock for not having recalled seeing her in this state previously. 

Amber smiled a wan smile but secretly she was pleased that her master had 
thought to make her with child so suddenly in such an obvious way. It was wise of him to �throw the old bastard for a loop.� 

He was certain this would be an interesting gambit to play. To make it appear as if the man was witless in regards to the passage of time they had together. Truthfully she wised 
that her master were the sire of the child within her. But she decided it unwise to complain. 

�This cannot be!� he exclaimed. 

�It is,� she breathed. �I am with your child. I wished you would show more composure in this regard.� 

�Composure? I just did not notice you swell with child before. It must be a trick of the light. My eyes must be deceived.� His look of amaze softened to a smile of his own. He looked her over more closely this time. 

His new pleasure was evident. He had seen through the deception but not deeply enough. �Perhaps you are right,� he said. He didn�t mean his words, though. 

She hated him for it. It was a look she wanted her father to give her on many occasions but the falseness of this look on his face hurt her and piqued her fury for him. She stomped her foot. �But you speak of MY composure? What of yours?�

He held out his hand to her in a way that was meant to welcome her into his bed with him. She spurned him. �I understand we have already done so to bring you about this way. I merely wish to listen to the child�s heart beat.�

�I will render myself without it if you continue to speak towards me with such guile and lack of true feeling.� The look of fury in her eyes was evident. He blanched at it. �I am sorry,� she said, even though her eyes did not soften. �I am on edge. I am with child. Your child, as you can see. A woman needs her times of anger at her man, does she not?�

He stepped forward to take her hand or to kiss her or to do something appropriate but she lashed at him again. He should have known she wasn't in the mood for such frivolity. He apologized. She left him standing there, ineffectual, to show off her belly for the women to coo over and for the men 
to think poisonous thoughts of him over. 

�Very well done, my sister.� She heard the comment before she saw him. That turned out to be a good thing.

She turned to where the voice came from and only saw a pair eyes glimmer at her from the dark. They were low to the ground and she found out why soon enough. A wolf came towards her. 

She held a hand up to her face and would have run if not at that moment the wolf spoke to her. 

�So you have done well. An interesting trick I must say.� The wolf licked his foreleg. �Mine is more interesting. A woman making herself seem pregnant is a petty trick when a man can make himself a wolf.� 

�Brother... I liked you when you were human.� She couldn't keep the fear out 
of her voice. The knowledge that her master was capable of such things had always been at the back of her mind. What sorcery was he using now? How could she top it? 

Almost as if he had heard these thoughts in her mind, he started to change. It was a horrible thing to witness. Hair fell from most of the wolf's body. It convulsed, but she stayed fixated on the spectacle. The fact that her master might be dying never even touched her mind. She stared in fascination, hoping for the day when he would teach her the same trick.

Even as she watched his mass increased. It was a bloody sight, but the wolf became a man. He spoke to her again in his own voice. �Sister, are you pleased now?� 

�Oh, brother, I am. But how did you know I was faking it?� She held her hand to her belly. She somehow learned how to make her own heart beat seem to come from her abdomen to fool people into thinking there was a baby in there. But she knew there wasn't.

�Sister, we are about to pull another trick,� he said, approaching her. 

�What trick is that, my beloved?�

�You are to become my mother,� he said. And then he vanished. Right afterward there was a pain in her belly. She lay on the floor, trying to shriek but no sound came from her mouth. She frothed at the mouth, convulsed as the wolf had. 

Closing her eyes, she looked within herself. Inside herself, she found an interesting sight. It was a boy. She began laughing and this sound was also muted. Her plans to destroy the stranger had just become a great deal more attainable.

LB: �What�s the situation?�

PB: �I think we have an inter-dimensional on our hands.�

LB: �A what?�

Papa Bear stirs slightly in his sleep. �Someone from another side of the universe is affecting our universe.� He pauses. �That�s what I think anyway.� 

LB: �That�s impossible.� 

PB: �Never underestimate the power of a determined mind. Psychic phenom as you know is a mental thing.�

LB: �I think you�re mental. Are you having delusions? Are your emotions right even your own? 

PB: �I am aware of no other possible explanation. These high-level psychics on the Neural Net? We are their puppets, us common folk. It would take a very advanced intelligence to do these sort of things, I agree. It is possible to do things across plains of existence. Even across time. One time I made 
Hitler eat his own booger.�

LB: �Hitler?� He glances sidelong at the other patrons of the particular diner he�s in to make sure he isn�t displaying any unusual behavior in the middle of this conversation. Satisfied, he continues. �He�s been dead for decades.�

PB: �Somewhere, in another portion of the universes, it is currently the 1940s. It took all the concentration I had, I admit, but booger he did eat. 
Goebbels looked at him funny but continued his report regardless.� 

LB: �Really? What were they discussing?�

PB: �That�s classified.� He wakes from his slumber. It is two hours past midnight in Los Angeles. He quickly initiates a pre-programmed ritual where his body goes through the motions of getting out of bed, undressing, showering, and eating cereal & eggs for breakfast while he concentrates his mind on more important matters. Matters of which are secret to even the writer. 

LB: �Oh.� He scratches his chin for a moment as something occurs to him. �Does the bitch slumber well?� 

PB: �Who do you mean?�

LB: �Mama Bear. Have any theories on who she really is?�

PB: �Just a moment.� He stops his body in the act of raising a cup of coffee to his lips to drink from it. Oops. �Your clearance checks out.�

LB: �As it should.� 

PB: �Believe it or not, she�s Eva Braun.�

LB: �Eva WHO?�

PB: �Hitler�s wife. Don�t you read the history books?�

LB: �Didn�t she also die?�

PB: �On the books, she did. He gut-shot her. Took a bullet in the brain 
himself. Unofficially, they both somehow survived. Ever wonder who the �Boss' is?� He smirks, burning himself with the coffee.

LB: �Who? Boss?�

PB: �Sorry. Just re-checked your clearance. I have stricken my last remark about Hitler from your memory as well as your question.�

Little Bear sneers. The bar tender gives him an inquiring look as he pours the cup of coffee.  �I think I recall the booger thing.�

PB: �Not that. We won't discuss Mama Bear or her past any further.� 

LB: �I wonder about that. You're Papa Bear and she's Mama Bear and you just commented that she was Eva for goodness sake. Doesn't that make you...�

PB: �It's a code word. I'm the Vice President of the United States of America. For reals. Not the puppet the people elected.� 

LB: �They voted for the President Elect, not his baggage.� Little Bear frowns. �That isn't the word I meant to use.� 

The bar tender leans over the bar and looks Little Bear squarely in the face. He says, �At least you're not like the other crazies who come in here. You talk to yourself without making much noise. But please don't call me a 'bitch' this close to happy hour.� 

PB: �Had you going there for a min, haven't I?�

Little Bear scowls. He pays for his drinks and deposits his car key into a locked box on the wall. It's a PROMISE BOX. The promise being that he won't drive intoxicated. Truth be told he hadn't drunken that much. Also truth be told he wasn't sure who the body of the owner of the car he was driving had been found yet. 

Little Bear was on the field, wearing another man's face as well as that other man's clothes. He felt his skin crawl a little at the thought. Then his mental conditioning re-asserted itself. Suddenly he felt as cool as a cucumber. 

He doesn't know his objective yet, he will know his target only when hissuperiors have deemed it an opportune time to carry out his objective.

He walked down one block and up the next. Something was pinging in his head, giving him a simple direction to follow. Every time he stopped to consider which direction he was actually going, he lost concentration. His thoughts got muddled a little.

Perhaps he was programmed to head in a direction but wasn't even allowed to know where he was heading or even in which direction? The ping blipped louder in his head for a moment in assent. It hurt. Something fizzled in his brain for a moment and he stopped in his tracks.

Just at that moment he had stepped off a curb in the path of an oncoming bus, but something caused him to step back onto the curb at just the right moment.

�Careful there, LB junior!� A voice said in his head. �You're too important to the bosses right now for you to die so soon or by accident!�

�Right. Sorry. Something in my head broke and I stopped... oh... you just healed it.�

�Nothing but a mini-stroke! Nothing to worry your little head about!� Little Bear could sense the voice turning its attention to an underling to scold them.

Little Bear was used to the scoffing & the referring to him as �little� or �small.� It was all part of his code name.

�So how is the next King of England feeling?� This nearly stopped him a second time, but he kept going.

�Which one am I supposed to be, Harry or William?� Little Bear grinned a little despite himself.

�Can't you tell?� More scolding. �I'm sorry, just pulling your leg.�

�Are you sure?� The concept was a new one on him. �When am I by the way?�

�Good question. You're on a little scouting mission. It has been determined 
that a certain Lady's death is might be inopportune. We're wondering if she 
didn't die...�

�So it is 1997? Good God. We can send people back that long?�

�As perceptive as ever, Junior.�

�So I'm gonna put a couple slugs into Henri Paul?�

�You ARE Henri Paul, Junior,� was the reply. 

�The freakin' driver! No wonder I tossed the keys. Uh? How many times have well done this before?�

�More perspective than is usual in an agent on the field you are, Little Bear.� There is a pause. �We might regret losing you.� Another pause.  �Six hundred sixty five times.�

Little Bear nearly stops in his tracks but continues on a few more steps because he had been in the middle of an intersection. Good thing he had or else he would have gotten hit by Porsche that came blazing around the corner too fast. It missed hitting by moments. �The mark of the beast. Damn. Why bother trying more than six hundred fifty five?�

�I was starting to like you, Little Bear. But superstition sinks ships. I don't have the patience with you to let you persist much further... whatever you do, don't pull your weapon on her.�

Little Bear continues his part of the conversation as he walks. �You're kidding? You mean we actually resorted to that?�

�The last incarnation shot out her tires. He warned her not to go and she was insistent. Then he got shot and she hopped into a Bentley & crashed almost immediately trying to flee the scene.�

�Do I have right of refusal?�

�I'm scrubbing you now. This mission is a bust. I'll tell the higher-ups we failed.� 

Little Bear blanked out and fell to the ground. He reaches beneath his jacket to the holster there, retrieves a pistol. He shoots himself in the face.

Amber was with child. Thesus struggled, but he could not grasp entirely in is own mind when they had been... together. He remembered only sleeping. He also doubted he had been in her tent long enough for her to have come this far into pregnancy. 

He hadn�t done it, so who did? 

He would find the father of her child. 

Having found a purpose for once, he labored to find the strength to get himself out of bed. He finally managed to put his legs over the edge of the bed, lifted himself heavily from the bed and tried to apply his weight upon them, sparks of pain buzzing down his legs from lack of use. 

His knees wouldn�t lock. Then he fell onto his butt on the floor. The chamber pot beneath the bed clattered but didn�t spill. But the smell was awful. How long had he lain here? 

He should empty the chamberpot, but didn�t have the strength to stand. He dared not pull himself to his feet. One leg was dead weight. The other buzzed from the toes up its entire length with pins & needles. 

He resolved to crawl for now, taking great care not to hit the chamberpot behind himself as he moved awkwardly along the floor. 

He expected Amber to come home to him, but she was strangely absent. Thesus crawled in the dark. It must have been very early into the daytime. He could see a little bit of light seeping into the corners of the tent. 

He found his way to one of those corners, not remembering if the tent flap was here or not. All at once his hand came to rest on a hot coal that had been in the fire pit. He shouted a quick curse, pain in his burning hand. It seemed that there was only one remaining hot coal in the mostly ashes. 

What had he known about fire? How long ago had the fire been set? Silly of himself to buhrne himself like that. 

Sitting next to the fire was a bowl of soup he hadn�t eaten. He stuck his wounded hand in there as he mused about something he had forgotten. 

Why had he just not thought �burn� was spelled �B-U-H-R-N-E?� Was it a name? 

Had it been someone he knew? 

He pulled his hand from the soup bowl. His fingers had turned green. Yuck. But what did this also remind himself of? 

All at once he was afraid. Other times, when he had come close to the fuzzy edges of a memory, he had fallen into an awful series of nightmares. He didn�t want to sleep now. He had a mission now.

Not exactly knowing what he intended to do, he pointed into the embers of the fire pit and said a single word. It was a quick, strange word, but even as he said it he forgot what he�d said. 

The fire in the fire pit all once sparked to life. The embers began to glow to his surprise. He�d cast a spell!

Uniquely pleased, he found he was hungry. He smelled his hand, but what he smelled made him feel a little dizzy. He�d been eating soup for he knew nothow long. Amber had given it to him.

Could something in the soup had made him sleep so fretfully? Thinking this over, he stood up without realizing his intention. Once he was up, he looked around. 

The very fact that he couldn�t stand a few minutes earlier had left his mind. 

He walked to the bed, rubbing his grubby hand onto his pants. The bed smelled awful. There were stains... 

Next to the bed was his pack. He leaned over, picked the pack up, then set it on a chair while he looked at its contents. Few of his old possessions were still there. The most valuable things in it were missing.

A small strip of fabric was in the bottom. He pulled it out and looked at it. 

Woven on the fabric was a picture of a boy�s face etched into a gold coin. He realized that this was HIS face he was looking at. A younger version of himself. 

Thesus stood, swaying for a few minutes as he finally remembered, then tucked the cloth piece back into his pack. He found himself crying a little. 

How did he become so old?  

As he put the pack on his backpack, memories came back to him, clouding his vision of as he walked from the bed towards the exit. He nearly stepped in the fire. Standing at the doorway, he looked behind his shoulder at it.

He muttered a word --- piffle! --- and the fire put itself out. He didn't want to be accused of burning her tent down as well as the other things she must have accused him of at this point.

The walk through the village was uneventful. He realized he didn't know which way was which. He also didn't know his way to the city walls or if there were any walls around the city.

He must have neared the border because a group of villagers approached him. 

They looked angry.

�Where you going, old man?� one of them wondered. He didn't look in their direction or attempt to answer.

�Sure, abandon us! Abandon us like even the Little Master did... did so long ago,� muttered a woman.

He glanced at her. She was old. He didn't recognize her face, which was progress.

�Does the father of my child wish to leave?� spoke up Amber. He heard her approaching from behind. He shuddered as he turned to face her.

As he moved, he heard a hiss of wind. His arm shot out reflexively, faster than one would credit him of moving. He caught an arrow... holding it by the tip of the arrowhead. She had attempted to shoot him from behind? This was getting interesting.

�See how quickly he moves!� She yelled. Many stunned faces surrounded them. �I told you this child was his! I told you he was a quick one.� She smiled. Then changed it to a frown before the smile had gotten warm on her lips. �A trixter.�

He wasn't sure what was happening, but he still held the arrow between his fingers, the fingers bleeding a little from having caught the sharp bits of the arrow. He dropped the arrow on the ground, stepping on it. He then put his fingers in his mouth and sucked on them. He quickly healed the finger tips. It wouldn't be noticeable.

She laughed at this action. �Have fun curing yourself of the poison!� This was the last he knew as the world fell into abrupt grayness. 


XXII

Bleach just ran. He heard something rustle in the leaves behind him above and looked frantically over his shoulder. It wasn't the darkling following him this time. It was the vulture. It had left its prizes up in the tree where it had landed earlier. He dared not look back again. The soldiers had found him in his camp. 
He was certain he heard the crash of hooves on the ground gaining ground upon him, visions of the dead soldier atop his now skeletal horse came to mind and he couldn't shake them off. 
If not his former friend whom he had buried; only to have the man rise from his own grave to haunt him later in that village far from the mountain's peak... surely Death himself rode at his back.
A wet pair of hands grabbed him by the shoulder and up rose the panic level again. Amy was also back from her watery grave to claim his soul! He tried to run but the clutching grasp kept him in one spot. He looked back and no one was there. 
The talons of the vulture sunk into the meat of his back and threw him to the ground. Then before he could get a grab at it, it had flown away with his a large part of his cape in its arms. His special cape. 
He cried and in his sudden despair he realized he was lost. Laying upon his face, he began to throw a tantrum. His fists and feet banged in the dust as he bawled like a much younger child. 
Oh, grow up! Came a voice In his head. He heard it not with his ears for it had no sound. But it rasped in his mind. Don't you humans spend enough time as babies in your cradles. 
�I'm not a baby,� he said aloud, falling still. No longer crying. 
Cradles of Sin they be. Sins against the Greater World of Nature you live in. The voice seemed to come from the vulture. Friendless you are... twice a runaway. 
�You laugh like that crow had laughed,� Bleach remarked, turning onto his back to look up at his tormentor. �Before my brother had killed it.� Then he remembered the burning casket. Before he could begin to weep again, the image in his head shattered like a pane of glass. It was replaced by a spark of white light. 
If I were a predator, so easily would I have sunk my beak or talons into your neck  to drink your blood, said the vulture in a casual remark. 
�Well you did attack me, didn't you?� Bleach wanted to know.
�Only because my wings were getting tired from following you.� Not surprisingly, the vulture had chosen a tall gravestone to perch from.
A shadowy figure landed next to Bleach. On its waist there was the scabbard and belt for the dagger. Upon its head it wore the steel helmet. The rest of its features were cloaked. He could not tell how tall this latest arrival was. 
Before he could address this person, it spoke. �So a scavenger complains about the chase for you? Indeed. I have been chasing you even further... grandson.� 
�Grampah? Am I dead now?� He climbed to his feet and almost fell.
The figure grabbed his elbow to steady him. �You look older.� He laughed. �In fact you look older than me at this moment.� 
Bleach felt his face and found his beard was still there. And then he found that his hair was a tangled mess as well. �Why am I old?�
�You wished to be older. Older and wiser. But you wished too hard and your age got too far ahead of you. And your wisdom was dimmed.� Grampah mused for a second. �You also have grown more than a little insane since I last saw you.� 





Random Insanity
by Michael Owen Reeve

CLAUDE IN MOURNING.
TFNY: �How could you do this to me?�
CLD: �You aren�t making any sense. How could I do what to you?�
TFNY: �THIS!�
CLD: �I don�t know what you think I�ve done to you, Tiffany.�
TFNY: �You�ve been treating me like a stranger. As if you
TFNY: �don�t know me or you�re afraid to hurt me.�
CLD:�I don�t want to hurt me.�
TFNY:�You don�t want to or you tell yourself you don�t want to, �
TFNY: �but you�re still hurting me.�
CLD: �How am I hurting you?�
TFNY: �You blame yourself for her death! You�re afraid
TFNY: I might be next!�
CLD: �Even if I did blame myself. How can that affect you?�
TFNY: �You do?�

It was suddenly very hard to hold onto the phone. He leaned against the broken husk of something that had once been a bath tub. At least he hoped it was a bath tub. He didn�t want to allow his mind to think of it as a coffin. Didn�t want to see her in it. The tragedy was all too recent in his memory. The metal shaft passing though her back and out her stomach, the shock of her navel having birthed five feet of curved steel. The curious lack of blood.

TFNY: �Are you there, Claude? Claude? The conn is still open. Speak to me!�
CLD: �Do you mind, Tiff? I need to cry here.�
TFNY: �Call me� when you�re ready to talk. I�m trying by best to
TFNY: �sound sincere about this.�
CLD: �I hadn�t detected any sarcasm.�
TFNY: �Well, I detected some from you just now, but� call me later
TFNY: �when you want to talk about it. I�m hanging up now.�

And with that, Tiffany was gone as well. Gone. Claude lay in desolation, lying against the bathtub that so depressingly reminded him of a coffin. The cell-phone fell from his limp fingers and scooted into his jacket pocket by virtue of the retractable chain it was attached to. Claude was the sort of person who felt taking something out of his pocket manually was okay, but putting it back into his pocket after he was done with it was a waste of time. Claude lay weeping among the trash of the decrepit city dump.

He wasn�t unusual in such a place. Everyone about him in this squalor was filthy as he was. His blond hair was shaved very close to his skull and his beard was blond as well even though it currently was black from tar and ash. 

He laid weeping, rubbing away the tears that came from his eyes and leaving sooty dark circles instead. It was a dreary, rainy night. His clothes were covered in muck, sodden and sticking to his skin. The night was miserable and he was appropriately miserable as well.

Claude had no idea how long he lay like this. A day passed without his knowing that the sun was in the sky. No one ever knew when the sun was out anyway in these lower reaches. The electricity for the few lights that still functioned in this dreck had gone out more years than anyone wanted to count.

By this time, a dog had urinated on him nearly three times without his noticing. He was too encumbered by his own grief to notice. All he heard was her voice. All he saw were her eyes. All he felt was his pain. She was just simply as gone as gone could be. He couldn�t understand why it was that he lived, why he should breathe in a world where she no longer would.
Claude plucked the small phone from his pocket, held it to his mouth like a tricorder, and spoke into it.

�COMM: TFNY.�
(Claude�s words are in Japanese spoken aloud, the phone transcribes it instantly so that it appears on the screen as English.)
(Tiffany�s words are in German spoken aloud, the phone transcribes it instantly so that it appears on the screen as English.)
CLD: �I was just thinking. It somehow pains me that we are
CLD: �communicating with a dead language.�
TFNY: �I suppose you�re in a morbid mood today.�
CLD: �DON�T SAY THAT!�
TFNY: �I�m sorry. Well, you don�t understand German and I don�t understand Japanese.�
CLD: �There isn�t any other, living languages that can be a middle-ground?�
TFNY: �French was outlawed, remember? I�m not getting arrested�
TFNY: �just because you�re feeling gloomy.�
CLD: �You�re cold.�
TFNY: �Again with the morbid talk.�
CLD: �Do you have to comment on my behavior?�
TFNY: �What do you mean?�
CLD: �We�re just making pithy conversations without any real substance.�
TFNY: �Pithy?�
CLD: �Don�t ask me what it means. That�s just how it was translated.�
TFNY: �Hm.�

TFNY: �This conversation is too subjective and not philosophical�
TFNY: �enough for your taste?�

Claude stood up and stretched. Who could sense that Tiffany thought he was arguing with her. And he knew that he didn�t want to argue with her. He yawned. By this time he noticed the smell coming from himself. He made a face. Checked his pocket for his key card. Good. Still had it. The bio-lock on the front door of the apartment building was broken, so he had to cut in through the side-door on the alley with the older locks. He leaned forward and put his hand lightly on the smooth metal lid of the�. box he�d been lying against. Didn�t want to think of it as a coffin and he�d forgotten what that other thing he�d been thinking it was had been. Maybe he was feeling morbid today�

CLD: �Where are you, Tiff?�
TFNY: �I�m at home, sitting on the couch. You remember where my couch is?�
CLD: �Yah. As for me, I�m� well� sitting in an unpleasant place. Hm.
CLD: �you probably could call it an alley or something� honestly, I don�t know
CLD: �what it�s called.�
TFNY: �How did you wind up in a place you don�t know the name of?�
CLD: �Too busy grieving to check the signs when I walked here.�
TFNY: �Well, track your signal and then figure out the best way home.�
CLD: �You always loved pointing out the obvious things.�
TFNY: �Trust me. They aren�t as scary as the difficult ones.�
CLD: �I have no idea how I�m going to eat. I can�t remember if I have food�
CLD: �Uh. Well, I�ve got no pets, so there won�t be anything dead rotting there
CLD: �when I get back.�
TFNY: �It�s not funny; a joke like that coming from you in the mood you�re in
TFNY: �right now. That�s just not funny.�
CLD: �See me in UltiQue if you want to change my attitude. But later.
CLD: �When I�m home.�
TFNY: �Typical guy. You always want to settle things in a fight.�
TFNY: �You guys and your Ultimate Quest battle arenas.�
CLD: �Typical girl doesn�t like guy stuff.�
TFNY: �Okay, so we�re both atypical. UltiQue it is.�

Claude logged off. He spoke the �find me� command into the phone. A green dot appeared on the screen. �Going home.� A green triangle where he was headed for appeared on the screen as well. A dotted line connected the two and showed the distance between them. Half-a-mile. He was going to have to walk for quite a bit. He took a moment to consider how much the yakuza liked him this week.

SHE WAS GORGEOUS.
CAP ONE:
She was gorgeous. A tall, slender, pretty thing wearing a simple red dress, a white blouse, and a blue blazer overtop. Her auburn hair was tied back and up in a curt, professional style. She had the gait of a gazelle loping about gracefully in a hot African savanna. Her eyes were emerald green, clear open, thoughtful. Her nose was the right shape. Her mouth.

ELOISE: �Uh? Can we get back to the usual customer-store-employee routine?�
END SCRIPT

Liz walked carefully from the clothing store to the food court. She looked around quickly and didn�t see Eloise anywhere. It was a large room, though. She couldn�t remember if she was supposed to buy coffee for the two of them or if Eloise was or was she supposed to just get coffee for herself. 
So many questions she hadn�t thought of asking. She shuffled over to a table that wasn�t somewhat in the corner of the food court and not near any of the occupied seats. As soon as she sat down, Eloise set the two coffees down on the table and Liz, shrieking in surprise, fell backward onto the floor.

Eloise, �I guess I scared you. But I had said �hello� almost twice.�

Liz, �I�m deaf. Well, not completely, but I have trouble hearing sounds that aren�t coming from directly in front of me.�

Eloise, �So if you�re looking at it, you can hear it?�

Liz, �Right.� She glanced at the hand that Eloise was offering her. She did her best to get up on her own power before shaking the hand. �Ooops! You meant to help me up. God, I�m so stupid!�

Eloise frowned. �Don�t say that. I wouldn�t have asked you for coffee if I thought you were stupid.�

�You just met me. I�ve known me my whole life.� Liz looked down at the other woman�s elbow when she said this. From there she looked at her own hands.

�Same to you, yet I don�t think I�m a loser.�

�I said I was �stupid.��

�My sister said she was stupid at first. Then she was a loser. She said those things up until she killed herself. You look like her. I�m not letting two women die on me.�

�I�m sorry that she died like that.�

�There are other ways to die. Most people don�t have the luxury to choose when they perish.�

�So you�re attracted to suicidal girls?� Liz bit her lip. She looked up again at this point.

�Honey, every girl is suicidal. Heck, every person alive who isn�t suicidal is already dead.�

�So what is it that attracts you? Potential?�

�I think you are a wonderful person, but you could be better in some ways. You are definitely a somebody, but you could be a better somebody,� Eloise was saying. Liz groaned but El didn�t seem to hear her. �We all could use a little �tweaking.��

Tweak? So I�m a witch now? Is that what she�s saying? I can tweak my nose and suddenly be able to cast spells like Samantha? Darn. I don�t need a Daren in my life. Heck. I AM a Daren as it is. Despite her thoughts, Liz smiled because it was the polite thing to do. She also decided to ask a question because that was the proper way to feign interest. �So I have �wonderful� potential that needs �a little tweaking?��

�You don�t sound very enthusiastic for one. But, hey, that�s what I like about you. You wanna ask questions before you do things� you�re not one of those blind-faith people. Which is very adorable.�

�Adorable?�

�I stand corrected. Admirable then. Just my opinion, no disrespect intended. Please don�t mind.�

�You�ve got adorable opinions. But, well, don�t minds turn you on?�

�Looking at MRIs makes me horny. I lost that job because I kept embarrassing myself. People don�t seem to like the idea of passionate, beautiful techies. Wonder why, though?� Eloise laughed at Liz�s surprised expression and she leaned forward, taking the coffee from the carrier. �Mocha fine?�

�Coffee and chocolate. Mmmm.� Liz reached for hers, yet her eyes were still looking at El�s cleavage. She managed to pick up the coffee anyhow and take a sip from it. It wasn�t neither hot nor cold, a very pleasant medium. Eloise seemed to have an impeccable sense of timing.

�Well, when it comes to it, I�m pretty ambivalent when it comes to choosing between chocolate and vanilla girls; but my coffee�s always mocha.� She smiled. �Listen, my theory is: appearance is not every thing; but I think it�s important enough for us all to look our best. Because it thinks it helps you blend in with the crowd, which always feels better.�

�You went from being a techie to working in a clothing store?�

�Ugh. Well, it�s a very boring kinda job, but I do get to see plenty of women with their clothes off, which is always a perk.� Laughs. �When I look in the mirror and I see myself as pretty, it makes me feel good on the inside. Yah, I know. I�m ecstatic them I�m an incredibly clever person. Heck, I mostly dress myself with clothing people return to the store. Amazing! Sewing seems to fallen out of fashion. Rather than five minutes sewing, these yuppie ladies toss out an entire wardrobe if the tiniest little hole appears anywhere!�

�Very resourceful. I look in the mirror and I feel like I look crappy. I seem to love it when I feel really terrible.�

Liz sighed. 

�Well, honey, I�m not sure, but I think if I made you look ravishingly beautiful, would you think you�d be happy or really miserable?� Eloise sipped her mocha. �Don�t answer that. You�re one Cinderella who�d be very irritated if someone tried to �improve� her mice or her pumpkin.�

�It�s really awesome that you�re beginning to talk like I usually do. Gives me the opportunity to hear myself talking and yet have the words spoken by a more pleasant voice.� Liz said rather dolefully.

�HEY! There�s an idea! You ever thought much about doing screenplays? I�d love to read any scripts you could write down.�

�Nobody ever said anything nice about anything I�ve ever written.�

�See? That means you�re positively great at it and they�re beside themselves with jealousy!� Eloise laughed. What is it that you do, anyway? Besides drooling over pretty girls anyway.�

�I was drooling!?!�

�Well, maybe not from your mouth, but you were coming all over yourself when I stopped to talk with you.�

Eloise set her mocha down.

�You�re finished with yours?�

�Nah. Keep drinking yours. You don�t have to pretend to be done when I�m done. I�m patient as it is.�

�I feel so utterly transparent. Thank goodness I�m wearing my lead underwear.�

�Haha! And people call me �Lois!� You�re quite the catch, Beth.�

�Um, don�t be terribly offended if I prefer �Liz.� Sorry.�

�I�m just glad that I don�t have to lay THE SPEECH on you. Always more fun not having to stick to
something rehearsed that you honestly don�t care much for.� Eloise sorted through her purse and passed a laminated piece of paper to Liz. Much of what El had said about beauty earlier was listed on it, as well as: 
� I think if you look at yourself in the mirror while you�re wearing your favorite clothes, well I bet it would boost you into a better frame of mind.
� Self-Confidence mostly means liking how you look.
� (Save this one for skeptical men.) Why do you think girls wear make up? Because if we look in the mirror and see dark circles under our eyes and a pimple from our latest episode of PMS, well we�d just be more bitchy. Make up helps some people feel better about themselves.
� Better looks = Better folks.
� For others, it�s clothes, or the car they drive or their teeth being white. As shallow as it may sound, it�s just how our society is. So I�m not being totally shallow here.
� I feel once I am happy with what�s on the outside, and then I feel more prepared to work on what is on the inside.
� But that�s just me. (Smile.)

�Before I comment on it,� Liz said, �I have to ask who wrote it.�

�Well, sometimes you�ve got to write something you know in your heart to be dreadful, but� dreadful lies are very welcome to most people�s ears I�m afraid to say. Uh, so I wrote it. I did a wonderful job of not vomiting while I wrote that stupid list.�

�Thanks. You saved me the effort of pretending I liked it.�

�Every morning, the first thing I do when I wake up is take a piss on that damned list. Then I wash it clean. That�s why I laminated it.�

�I like potty mouths.�

�Ack! You don�t mean you like having girls piss in your mouth?�

�Argh, no! I just didn�t know how to lead off from what you�d said about why you laminated the card� so� you were kidding?�

�Right,� smiles Eloise. �You made your joke, I made another.�
�Okay. I don�t know many people� I guess it�s because I never know when people are kidding.�

�With me, I�m always wishing they�d STOP kidding and just be serious about something for a few minutes.�

�A serious relationship that lasts a few minutes?�

�That�s not what I meant, but�� Eloise catches herself and laughs again. �You�re witty. Even though you don�t believe you are, you�re actually very amusing AND also insightful. Most people are threatened by that sort of thing; they don�t know how to deal with someone who isn�t easily classifiable.�

�I�m the nerdy chick who thinks her snatch is used for storing her slide-rule,� Liz said mournfully. 

�Not literally of course.�

�So. When do you usually ask a girl if she�d like to get naked with you? After the first or fourth cup of coffee?�

CAPTAIN CAVE GIRL!!!!!!!!
Alternate:
Liz (sighs). (Inclines head to stare at ceiling.)

Narrator (aka Narr.): The dream of the auburn-haired beauty is dissolved and is inadequately
resolved into the gray, depressing reality of her singledom.

Liz (talking to self): �It seems that the only goal I can accomplish is the one I really don�t want to but seem to have a knack at achieving; failure. Not that I consciously wish to fail at anything.

Eloise (voice over): �Who�d want to do such a thing?�

Narr: Liz starts, surprised. Then she composes herself.

Liz: �The certainly of doom never leaves me, it�s always looming large in my mind. I just see the
faults in everything I simply can�t appreciate the good part of anything. It�s like I�m inflating a balloon with only the express interest of bursting it and starting over again. What a sick game. I can�t even let myself hope that some day I�d actually have a nice balloon around to brighten my day up.�

Narr.: Eloise walks into scene.

Eloise: �You�d blow your balloon up, then when it was filled up, your fingers would lose grasp of it�s
string and it�ll fly away into the sky out of your own reach. You�d feel sad because you were down on the ground and couldn�t follow it on its happy voyage into the sky.�

Liz: �What women doesn�t have issues with abandonment of some kind?�

Eloise: �Everyone loses something.�

Liz: �I�m dreaming again.�

Narr.: Eloise�s image shimmers for a moment, becomes a wire-frame to show that it is a simulation.

Eloise does a Threepio-worried motion (arms rigidly bent at the elbow ninety degrees, swivel hips, turn head left and right) to show that she is a machine. Liz laughs.

Liz: �That move is SO three-kay years ago! I�m surprised you would have known how to do that.�

Eloise: �You watch that film serial sim enough times for me to find a pattern.�

Liz: �Really, what pattern?�

Eloise: �You seem to watch ep6 the most. I bet you love seeing that woman in the uncomfortable
lingerie strangling that approximation of masculine over-indulgence.�


Liz: �Right. The chick in the metal underwear strangling the big slug-dude.�

Narr.: Eloise�s image shimmers again. The clothes evaporate, leaving a nude woman with a bald head. Then, she becomes a simulation of Princess Leia in black-leather dominatrix regalia and high heels. She even has a dog collar around her neck with a chain, the chain held about her shoulders like a stole.

Eloise: �I could become solid and show you pleasure. You know this.�

Liz: �A vampire can only enter into my home if I invite it. I�m not in the mood now. Anyway. We were having a conversation.�

Narr.: Eloise becomes a rabbit sitting on a drum. The rabbit hops up and down on the drum and manages to bow. Liz ignores this.

Liz: �I�m just sorry I didn�t call myself �Bonnie� at first. It was so obvious, his name being Claude and all. But then again, I didn�t want him to think I was making fun of him� maybe he wasn�t serious. Maybe �Claude� was his joke and he�s disappointed that I hadn�t reciprocated appropriately?�

Eloise: �Get serious, Liz. You change your name as often as chicks in earlier decades would�ve
changed the color of their hair or something else as frivolous. �Oh, I�m tired of being the
red-headed-chick, I want to be the-blond-haired-chick from now on! That�s who I�m going to be!��

Liz: �Names. You�re saying names are frivolous, Eloise?�

Eloise: �Gawd. Don�t you hate it how people would cement themselves into believing their identity is
DEFINED by a name? How the name of their family is important to them?�

Liz: �You�re right! Crap, you don�t even decide your name. Your dang parents GIVE it to you when
you�re a baby the minute you�re born while you�re still naked and shivering and scared shitless that
you�re suddenly not in the womb any more.�

Eloise: �Yah, we all start inside of a woman. A part of her body, grown within her. And that isn�t
where our �legacies� begin. Of course not! Some guy who pokes his dick into the woman, who barely
does any of the work get most if not all of the credit.�

Liz: �Hey, he�s pissed off because he�s missing a rib. The rib from which she was formed. Yah, right! Only a man would say �Hey! It doesn�t count that I came out of a chick�s cooch. Because, you see, God --- who was a very important MAN --- yanked a rib outta some dude�s chest.�

Narr.: The rabbit becomes an egg. The egg cracks and a baby is shown inside.

Eloise: �You ever wish you were born in an egg? Like that guy in the red pajamas?�

Liz: �We�re straying from the point here. God, to be prisoner to something as ridiculous as the
name-game! How many girls who could have done something positive for the world were murdered
as infants because their fathers hadn�t wanted to lose his dignity, his pathetic legacy founded on
deceit?�

Eloise: �So what? You�re saying you feel that the only coupling that has got integrity at all is one
without some dude spoiling everything?�

Liz: �Now don�t you try to simplify anything!�

Liz had in fact reflected many times how men, in this ridiculous game of �marriage� and the procreative frenzy that it unleashed, must construe their becoming fathers to daughters a defeat. If he should only have girls, then he would lose to when some other, luckier father�s son had stolen his own legacy from him. It had become common practice for girl-babies in some parts of the world to become abandoned or killed outright to avert the shame of such a defeat. After all, the prestige of the last name, the family name, is more important than any member of a family�s life. Outright lunacy. Sitting alone in her climate-controlled loft, even with the heat on, Liz shuddered. Thinking such things never failed to really creep her out. 

Eloise: �You should be creeped out by a lot things. The fact that I�m a hologram representation of
one of your alternate personalities who is speaking to you through thoughts in your mind. By the fact that you are talking to yourself. And I can read your mind AND worse yet, you mostly think of yourself in the third person. That�s MAJOR creepy. But anyway� so� perhaps, on an intellectual basis, perhaps� this could explain your own leanings towards lesbianism? Women loving each other mutually rather than falling prey to traditionalist idiocy and pillaging by the male menace. He hasn�t called.) 

Narr: Liz smirked.

Liz: �I can�t help it. It�s all terribly amusing that I�d be thinking �male menace� and then next to that I�d be worried about a boy being late to call me. It wasn�t as if I had any plans of dating this Claude person. That Martian-uncle guy who was somebody�s favorite would be a more likely suitor for me. But still��

Narr: The phone rings. Claude�s face appeared between them.

Eloise: �Our time is up.�

Narr: Eloise vanishes, leaving only Claude�s simulated face hovering in the air.

�To be continued... 


Nothing surprises.
Everything is expected.

These words are engraved upon the plinth of the statue. The statue itself is a rather bored looking man with his chin resting on his fist and staring impassively at the ground in front of himself.

Murders have been committed on that piece of ground, in regard of the statue. Women planted flowers there. Couples had conceived there. The statue is the witnesses of many of life�s most dramatic occurrences and not a trace of surprise it shows. As if the whole of humanity it had already foreseen. Not a few people hung themselves from its elbow. Hasn�t everything been seen already? Perhaps by the statue. 
He sits on the opposite end of the statue, on a bench, his back leaning against its back. He is young; he hasn�t seen nearly everything, not nearly enough. He can understand how the statue must feel, never seeing more than what it sees in that one spot. He lifts his head, looks every which way. Theoretically, he can go places the statue can never go to. He can stand and walk. Walking, he never gets further than the eight points of a compass from the statue. It is a small village there isn�t much of it. 
He�s been here his whole short life. The statue is his only friend. The people speak to him, but he cannot understand their words. He can understand the tone when they shout at him. He knows as he runs, a loaf of bread or an apple clenched in his hands, that they are calling him a thief. He is a thief, but he knows not the currency that is used here, how many of it is needed to buy what he steals. So he runs and they shout at his retreating back.
Being a thief doesn�t shame him. It is a necessity of his survival. He imagines they call him �the boy who is the statue�s friend.� It�s as much of a name for himself as he can think of. 
�
He is the statue�s witness. He tells it what he sees. He cannot know if the tongue he speaks is known by any other living person besides himself. But he knows the statue listens gladly to each word. 

Cacophany. When sound cannot be divided from noise. When meaning is not only lost, but missing, and fearful that it may not again be found. 

Young boy: �That�s fantastic! That is good. That is a story.�

Mother: �Yes, it was a story. What do you think it should be?�

Young boy: �I mean I liked it.�
�
Mother: �It is well to be expected. I wished that you�d like it.�
�
Young boy: �I certainly did.�

Prologues:
Birth, mother

He hated her for giving birth to him; a gift, which he often thought, was not given profitably. That was too kind. She had freed him from a claustrophobically small prison which had been all the more uncomfortable since he had been forced to share it with his brother, only to be put him in a much larger one. 
 
Even as he reflects on these things, the twin moons of Dava sweep the night sky; their serpentine eyes gaze upon the world in a ceaseless search for light. They are the embodiment of shadow, creatures so hideous that they blend in perfectly with the night. They furnish no light of their own, but are ruthless thieves of it. They exist only to taint the beauty of God's Flower. To corrupt and covet her warmth and luster selfishly, rather than shine upon the world in tribute to her. His foolish brother happily walks in the light of day.  Blacky prefers the night.
 
He and his brother were born to the Goddess of Harvest during an equinox. They had both been reminded of this fact throughout their young lives, yet Raven Feather (for such is the name which he'd given himself) could remember that day as vividly as any other moment of his life. They hadn't been born separately, as all other, ordinary twins were. No, they came into the world at the exact same instant, in each other's arms.  The first sight of his life had been that idiot�s face. That face, so like his own. It had seemed that he had been looking into a mirror at his own reflection. So infuriated was he that his infants hands had found themselves firmly clamp around his idiotic brother's throat, so accustomed had he been to murder, even on the hour of his birth. It was then that his brother had awakened, his eyes betraying surprise, then mortal terror. He brought his own face within an inch from the others and cursed him while he could only gag breathlessly.  He watched as the life drained out of the eyes of that pale face. His brother only cried and loosely embraced him, wanting him to stop, yet unwilling to let go all the same.  The act would have been so deliciously fulfilled if their mother had not separated them at that moment. She then held each child to either breast so that they would not need to share. The idiot drank of her hungrily, yet Raven would have none of her. He would not drink her milk; he only wished he were dead; anything would have been better than accepting nourishment from her. When she pressed him to try a taste of it, he had bitten at her with his teeth, making her bleed. It was only after this first taste of blood that he had deemed to suckle from her.
 
 
While her children fed from her, she raised her face to the heavens and sang in praise of the Sky Woman, praying for her to watch over her children. They both looked up at the same instant, witnessing the same event for the first time in their lives. It was a sight that would never fail to enrapture his stupid brother, even a decade later. As they all stared at the sky, their mother named them. She called him Ebon, his brother Ivor. �It is through their union that Dusk and Dawn might finally see each other, eye to eye.� He could sense the love she and his mother felt for each other at this moment, their love for him. He could only hate them both in return. She thwarted him in his search for vengeance, so he could only take solace in the knowledge that, thanks to his efforts, his brother would forever have the complexion of a walking corpse.   
 
Ever since then, each has pledged their hearts to opposite forces. Even as the darkness usurped the blasted light's rule, Blacky embraced it. Embraced it in the way his mother had pretended to embrace him. Even as the serpents crushed the life out of the Sky Woman, his own mother attempted to crush him! Did she somehow sense, even at birth, the evil that lurked in his heart? She crooned, kissed, and laughed, mocking his hatred of her with her false love. Consequently, it is only during the biannual equinox (the First and Last day of the Dwarven Calendar) that they can walk the earth together.
 
While he broods in his dark thoughts, the twin moons of Dava traverse the darkness. Other people can only see the eyes of the Serpents, but he can see more. The Serpents glide and sliver along the sky, crisscrossing and running parallel of each other, enthralled in their search for the light. He respects their determination, but questions their goal. Why seek the blinding light of day, when they could simply rescind it and hunt in the night like him? 


Motives:
Why Did He?

His malignant heart was rife with a hatred of all things. Everything within his sight, he hated. Every sound in the night, every nuance of life and un-life, the incessantly chirping crickets, the silence of stones, were all things which his ambiguous hatred consumed of him. He had once seen his own face, in the glimmering steel of a knife he had intended to steal from a butcher, and hated himself at first sight. He had not known what it was that he had perceived in that brief second before he had struck at it in rage, before he had cut himself so grievously that he bled.  He had drank of his blood that first time, instinctively suckling from it as a newborn child would of another source --- only, his initial motive had not been merely an act of gaining nourishment, but a reflexive action. Afterwards, he hated the butcher for possessing such an object to bring harm to him. He hated pain even more than all things, even more than he'd hated himself a moment ago.  He'd taken the knife, carried it with him into the home of the butcher which had brought him such pain, and had given it back to him in a way much more intimate than the butcher would have ever wanted. He had given it back to him --- right through the bastard's heart.
 
There had been a time when his life had not been so simple, when he had agonized for many hours, many days, every waking moment. And every one in which he wasn't awake at all; his misfortune had plagued him in his dreams, as well. He had so desired not to be in such chaos, had wanted to settle for one and only emotion. Something he could count on. 
 
A friend which would never leave him, no matter where he went. A friend he could never leave behind, even if he thought that he no longer need it, because deep in his heart, he would always need it. He so desperately wanted a friend. A guiding light: a dream.

The Victims:
THE PRINCESS MEETS HER DESTINY

Walking past the silent pews, his cloak manifest as a living shadow, his steps carried him ever closer to his destiny. In the distance, the cacophony of the approaching mob drifted on the wind to his ear. This pleased him. Their cries for redemption were as insignificant to him as the chirps of crickets. Their complaints of his crimes did not concern him. He had enjoyed the killings. Anyone who chose to punish rather than reward the �murderer� of their loved ones was inherently a fool. Death should be celebrated, not mourned. Life was the true tragedy; to be released from life into death was a blessing. And he enjoyed his capacity to present this blessing.

He mostly enjoyed their screams. And he was a master at extracting such beautiful screams from his chosen; each meticulous incision was made with utmost care, each tiny cut brought a feeling of exquisite ecstasy from both he and his victims. He delighted in the fear that pain would bring, the way their faces simultaneously filled with life and being drained of it. Such proves that love taking far surpasses lovemaking.

Those were his thoughts as he walked. Those were always his thoughts. He knew, he believed. The only concept he could not comprehend was fear. He knew others had fear in them; it was his mission in life to release it from them. But he could not remember being afraid. He frowned slightly. They could never teach him fear. Even if he were to be caught and executed, they could never accomplish his task. They had not the imagination nor the genius with which he was sole owner. They could never properly torture him. If anything, the only thing that could cause him to be afraid was the certainty that he would never feel fear. He shook his head, negating this troubling thought before it could breed. Instead, he cast his thoughts back to his latest endeavor.

He�d seen her. She was walking down a street --- it mattered not which because all streets in this asylum were all equally polluted with lunatics --- and his eyes only saw her. She was peculiar, perhaps even unique. She stuck out of the crowd. When men and women saw her coming, they got out of their way. They didn�t stand their ground. The men didn�t grope for her; the women did not shove her. Upon seeing her, shock instantly came into the looker�s face and they shoved their hands behind their backs; even dropping or throwing away whatever they had held. She had a walk which made her seem better than everyone else, and their deference of her proved it. Yet she was not better than him. They could not see him but they were afraid of him. But she was different. She could be seen and was feared. He became jealous of her, suddenly wanted more than anything to make her especially afraid of him.

And then the truly extraordinary happened. She looked at him. She turned her head and he was suddenly staring deep into her emerald eyes across an empty space in the teaming masses. She was looking directly at him and she wasn�t afraid. She lifted her hand to her mouth and he could see her laughing at him beneath that raised hand. The other hand pointed at him and she turned, still laughing, toward the nearest peasant. It was a butcher. The butcher followed her gesture and he, too, could suddenly see him, too. He swallowed, his throat working tremulously, and he managed a small, sick smile. He didn�t think what she was pointing at was funny, either. But all the same, the butcher had just signed the death warrant for himself and his entire family. Not right now, but later. After he had finished with her, the butcher�s family would all sing in chorus. Too bad all anyone else would hear was �screaming like bloody murder.� A smile. That�s exactly what it would be.

She stopped laughing; the smile on her face became a vague frown of disgust at the butcher for not laughing along with her. She shoved him and even though he obviously was much stronger than she, he fell. He fell as a cow would if it were bludgeoned with a sledgehammer. Now that was a funny thing, a butcher pretending to be a slaughtered animal. She continued walking down the street, stopping once in awhile to take whatever she wished from the merchant�s booths. He once again slipped into invisibility. He easily drifted ahead and ducked into an alley which he knew she could not help but to pass. As she came into view, he grabbed her by the arm and threw her into the alley. The clumsy girl catapulted head first into a wall like an arrow into a butte. She was out before she could make a scream. Laughing, he took the opportunity to tear her clothes from her slender form; delighting in the fabric�s ripping as much as he would enjoy the ripping of her flesh.

Oh the things he did. They were all magnificent! The cunning! The genius! The ambition! First he bound her, hanging from her wrists from either wall. In his haste to waken her, he brushed his hand a tad too briskly against her face. So fragile was her imperfect skin that his caress left a mark and blackened her eye.

Her eyes flew open immediately and their eyes met. She had that look in her eyes. That look he knew and loved. A look of fear. From his pocket he extracted a small knife with a very fine blade --- something he incorrectly believed to be called a �scallop,� but his not knowing its proper name didn�t hamper his knowledge of how to use it  --- and showed it to her. He saw her delight in her eyes; that tiny gleam of anticipation in her pupil. That tiny hint of long, to be free, to be free from inhibition. He started with a single, slow cut; across her left thigh. The screams sent shivers through both of their bodies. They both loved it. 

The delicate incisions continued, in numerous parts of her anatomy. Each small cut bringing further beauty to her body. Here the kiss of metal upon a breast, the other, upon a cheek, upon a buttock, upon a chin, even to the root of her womb. She was panting, eyes tearful with the obscenity of her pleasure. The words upon her lips, �Please! Please!� and he endeavored to do so. For hours, his knife reveled in its love taking. It was cleansed in her blood. It drank as much as he drank.

Each scream brought them both more joy, more humor, more bliss. Oh the things he did to her. And then the blade sought to bury itself into the nexus of her sex, sheathing itself where other men�s lesser swords could only hope to find a home.

Then he salted her wounds and began to feed. He tore flesh from her body with his teeth. He stared into her eyes for a third time as he took a bite from her shoulder. This time she knew him, she died knowing who he was and he was much that gladder for having his face be the last thing she had seen in the world.


She was the first. The most succulent. A waif of a girl in a silken dress. She wasn't really a princess, her father simply called her one. Hers was the wealthiest families of all the wealthy families. Her father lived like a king, called his daughter "Princess" and did his best to treat her like one. She always had the finest clothes, the most jewelry, and the softest, most beautiful skin. Princess may have been considered well-off, but she was far from innocent. 

Many were the hard-worn and callused men that had been softened within the grasp of her own well-manicured hands or delicately painted lips and polished teeth.

Night Dreams

Walking in a house he didn't know, it was dark, yet he could see perfectly in the dimness. He was awake at night in a strange house.  He could hear crickets. He couldn't hear his own feet as he walked or his breath. He moved in the darkness with the grace of a cat. And as even as he thought it, here came one. He kicked it.

He shocked himself by doing this, but was shocked once again as his hands, as treacherous as his walking feet, reached for a knife from a cupboard in the dark.  A pale shard of moon light from a window from which he'd entered this dark room reflected off the glimmering steel, blinding him for a moment. He hissed. When he looked again at the blade, he saw the reflection of a face
(that was)
that wasn't his own. Before he could remember whose face in that brief second
(it was his face)
if it wasn't
(it was)
his own, his other hand formed a convulsive fist and struck at it in rage. He held his injured hand in, drinking from his bleeding hand. He didn't know where he was
(he did)
and didn't know who he was any more
(he did know)
and now he was bleeding. This horrified
(aroused)
him that he should live such a nightmare
(dream of ecstasy). The blood tasted foul
(splendorous)
 in his lips.  The fear
(ecstasy)
sent shivers up his spine so that he was stiff from the waist down 
(incredibly stiff in that regard)
and up the back of his neck. The cat, a smaller blob of darkness in the greater darkness with its luminous emerald eyes, the one he'd kicked by accident
(on purpose)
hissed at him from the dark. He bent his own back up and hissed at it. The cat relented with a whimper and ran from what it took to be an even bigger cat. The cat ran down the hall and thudded gracelessly into a door in its haste. It raised its voice plaintively in the dark and a girl's voice whispered to it from the other side of the door. "Quiet, you stupid thing. You almost killed yourself and woke up the house with your racket."

He felt himself moving closer to the door and the girl's voice, moving with quiet grace that even a cat would envy. As he neared, the cat's screeches became louder and the girl's voice came back closer as well and slightly angry, "I am beginning to wish you had! Quiet! Let you in must, but you won't like what happens when I do!" With that, the door opened and then ran inside the room. 

Before the door could close again, he pounced onto the girl ---	she was wearing only a silk robe that flew open when he grabbed her shoulder --- and threw her into the room before closing the door. She fell into a sitting position on the bed, her robe torn from her body when she stepped on the trailing hem. Now all she wore was a portion of one sleeve up one arm. The rest of her was naked. She held a table leg in her hand which she had been using to puncture herself with in the dark of the night on her lonely maiden bed and now brandished its dripping length as a club. 

She rose to her feet and struck at him with her "pleasure stick" (the table to which it belonged was now a three legged martyr to lust). He deflected the blow with a back sweep of one hand and punched her in the face with the other. Before she could shout, he kicked her brusquely in the stomach; a pain which was now something less pleasurable than the one she'd given herself.

He yanked her head back up by the hair and brought her face level with his own.  She was no longer afraid or angry, the only shock was his own as she smiled and the leaned forward to kiss him as he grabbed her wrists with either hand. She kissed him, the soft meat of her tongue gliding along his teeth and mingling with his own.  He tasted her and she tasted him, she was sour to him and him sweet to her. She pulled back a little to run her tongue up along his lips, one cheek, and the side of neck as well. "All I ask of thee is that mine elders do not hear. Use me as roughly as you want, but be silent with your pleasures," she told him around another smile.

He bent forward, grabbed her ankles and then yanked them so that she fell back into the bed. He positioned each of her ankles on either of his shoulders and smelled the cave of her sex. It smelled uxoriously of warm blood. He breathed deeply of it, the scent of her. And she was still dripping.

He kissed it and his lips came back moist with blood. He licked this off greedily. There was a spot of blood on his nose. He got this as well, and he heard her moan at the sight of such a trick. He had never guessed such a miracle. He had known that girls bled. Had known because he had caused many to bleed. But he had never dreamed that they would bleed without even being cut. Cut. He opened his eyes and peered at the fork where her legs met. It certainly did appear that she�d been cut there. It was a deep gash, festooned with a curly bushel of coarse hair. How any man could love this, he asked himself. an answer was not forthcoming. It looked nothing so much more than lids of an eye, minus the eye. Or a tongue less mouth. Beneath the blood, he found that the labia were bruised. Mute evidence of her senseless need. He played his tongue out and tasted the circumference of the inner weavings of her thighs. It tickled beneath either knee, even overtop each buttocks and the base of her spine. He still didn�t know. The tongue ran up along her stomach and found each nipple The girl was chanting some strange words he could not begin to understand. 

She was clearly enjoying whatever he was doing to her, but his questing tongue only sought to taste, to explore, to fulfill a curiosity. He brought his head to that tongueless mouth again and kissed it. She rocked backward and suddenly both her legs were scissored around his neck and her feet locked at the ankles. his head was trapped against that hateful place. He would have screamed, but the smell of blood was too tempting. 

Abortive Measures

She was quick on her feet. This was a pleasurable surprise. She ran fast and hard in spite of the burden she carried. Or perhaps what lent her the most impediments for speed was the weight and the promise it brought with it. It seemed a foolish thing, to run so far and so fast for such a heavy promise. He only regretted that she made so much noise.

Her heavy tread roared on, feet pounding with such a force that he believed she didn't simply want to cover ground but to have some destructive need to destroy it as she went. The tracks in the snow were craters, large ungainly holes more suited to meteorites than a woman's feet. Along the center trail was a line of steaming urine. Leaning his face into the mess he smiled at the scent of her fear. It was delicious. From his grinning mouth his long, serpent�s tongue cascaded into the puddle and he drank her warm fear from the snow like a thirsty wolf. In the distance to the west he heard the melodious sympathy of her pounding feet, furiously beating heart, and her ever more ragged breathing.

Squatting face down in the snow, his eyes shut, he smelled her fear, heard her fear, drank her fear, squatting face down in the snow, he loved her fear. He smiled, his 
thoughts singing with his love for her fear.

The happy circumstance of his discovery of her came to him his interior darkness and he swam in the recollection. He had no need to hurry. He would find her and thank her for running later. 

He'd happened across a tent.	The tent was lit from a fire on the inside. Through the fabric of the tent he could see two figures. One was lying on its back, legs splayed while the other was kneeling with its hands held together between the lying one's spread legs as if in prayer. Even before her heard them speak he knew they both must be women. The evidence was unmistakable. He smelled blood, warm and fragrant. The smell of blood was coming from their legs. Their menstruations were ministering to his thirst.

The woman on her back was panting, dank with sweat and tears. The kneeling woman held a wash cloth in one hand and a man's razor in the other. Her intent was clear as she was washing and shaving the lying woman's pudendum in preparation for the birth.

"Watch where you put that damn thing, Jennifer," the woman on her back was complaining.

"A woman like you should learn that she should be more afraid of how blunt the thing a man holding is and less about how sharp what a woman is holding when it comes to her place. You'd be smarter to let a woman in there, knowing she couldn't come in. Invite a man and he'd never want to leave her cozy hole."

"Well his blunt thing didn't have chance of making me bleed like a stuck sow when he poked me with it," the other replied.

"You didn't bleed when he stuck you?"

"Alright I did. So shove that damn thing in there if you're so insistent in asking. Damn me if I wished asked so much. If he had, I might not have let him and you'd be getting your lovely little peek in a night a lot less cold than this."

Jennifer laughed at that and it was the last sound she'd make. He clubbed her from behind with a log from the fire and she fell forward into the woman on her back's crotch. He took the wash cloth and shoved it into the prone woman's mouth as he dragged Jennifer to her feet.

He cut her dress off of her with the razor and jammed a knife into her eye. The knife slid easily into her brain at that angle and he carved her eye socket wider with corkscrewing motions. The woman on the floor tried to take the gag from her mouth and he sliced her hand with the razor, severing a pair of fingers.

The knife and the razor weren't necessary for his purposes. He'd murdered women in his time with an efficiency  and quickness using his bare hands  that such that would wish to believe he could kill one as if with a single touch. But his thirst for fear was sometimes more prevalent than his thirst for blood. As it was at this time. He drank her fear from his staring eyes. She lay still on the floor, turned about so that she was on her hands and feet. He could see and smell her fear, but also cunningness as she was about to pounce or bolt but indecisive over which alternative was her best. He smiled at both of her motives. 

And, just as unnecessarily, he made his move. He carved Jennifer's breast from her corpse and ate it. Then he cut out her tongue ate that as well, drinking the unnamed woman's fear as he did. But this was a beginning to the festivities. He could feel the woman's courage begin to die at the sight of his appetites. He savored it. He briefly considered what he could accomplish if he were to spend hours engrossed such a game but he dismissed it.

 He had best finish with it and move on. He didn't enjoy what he was doing to the corpse, his efforts of further perfecting what had once been Jennifer could only mar --- transforming his deathly art into a lively indulgence. The death he had given her was a singular gift; but a man who gives too many gifts is a pest. And worse still if his true prey should believe him to playing games. 

The woman had finally chosen. She leapt to her feet, using the weight around her middle as a balance as she moved. He was knocked to the floor, laughing. He pretended to slash at her wife the knife and was pleased when she caught his wrist and took the knife from him. With a final kick at his laughing face, she ran out into the snow.

The knife did not serve her. In the end she'd dropped it as she ran and had not dared stop to retrieve it. Better still, she even managed to cut herself with it in her haste and bled steadily. It was the blood from the wound she'd given herself that he followed. The knife he didn't pickup from the ground. He did not need it for what he had planned for her.

 Furnace.

He sat in a furnace. He crouched in a gathering of flames so hot that they burned as they were a small pocket of hell upon the earth. He did not notice the fire, though. It did not burn him, nor did his face look as if he realized where he sat. He seemed as casual as if he�d been simply perched in the midst of a warm bath tub full of tepid water rather than in an inferno. 
 
His hands clasped his knees and the wrists were slit with thunder bolts of incisions and blood poured freely into his lap. Once in a while, he would hold his flayed wrists to his lips and drink of his own blood. The blood flowed and was endless, an ocean of scarlet stuff that was boiled by the flames as it rested in his lap. The hairs all over his body were aflame as well, as was the hair on his head. But, instead of screams of pain, his lips only loosed giggles of satisfaction and maniacal bouts of laughter. In between giggles and laughter, he chanted the same fragment of words incessantly.
 
�Raven�s Feather from unwholesome fen� Raven�s Feather from unwholesome fen� Raven�s Feather from unwholesome fen� Raven�s Feather from unwholesome fen� Raven�s Feather from unwholesome fen� Raven�s Feather from unwholesome fen��
 
Cackling with laughter, seated casually in an inferno of flames that did not burn him, bleeding profusely from the wrists, genitals boiling in blood, he chanted.
 
He stared straight up towards the ceiling. Upon it, he�d drawn a five-pointed star --- a pentagram --- with his own blood, but it wasn�t long before he saw through the ceiling, though the pentagram stayed in his vision (reflecting the flames that did not burn him) and he could the night beyond and the moons above him in the dark.
------------------------------------
  
When he found her, Mel-Annie was a young girl. She was playing with her doll. Her father was poor and so his daughter only had one doll to play with, but she had only one father, any way, so she loved both adamantly. It was hard not to love your one and only of something. She had no comparison, could either love what she had or hate what she didn't. She chose to love her father and love the doll he gave her. But it wasn't such a simple precept for her father. 

He was one to hate what another man and had and which he'd unfairly been denied. A wife for instance. He couldn't remember what had happened to his daughter's mother, but she must have had a mother, and this woman must have been briefly his wife. The proof of his erstwhile wife was there in the yard with the ugly rag doll of hers. 

Where the fuck had she found that damn thing, any way? It was filthy, attracted flies, and smelled something rank. Did the stupid little cunt wipe her ass with the fucking thing, was that why it smelled so fucking awful? Goddamn, how could a girl love something so much and use it wipe her ass with it? Had the girl's mother given it to her?

He scowled at the thought. His head was swollen with pain. He knew he shouldn't be thinking so hard. His head always hurt when he thought hard. He took a slow pull from the half-empty bottle of kerosene and tried to steady his headache. When it dissolved into the slightly diffuse gnawing of a toothache, he reconsidered his last idea. The girl's mother?

The girl herself was happily talking to her shit rag. Ugh, she just kissed the damn thing. That's just not right. He intended to shout at the girl, to tell her to stop kissing what she used to wipe shit off her bottom with, but the words came out in a barely audible mumble. The girl pretended to hear him, said, "I will, Poppa," and then made the doll wave its little hand at him. Foul odor or not, that little kid sure loved that damn thing. The thought that she loved him, too, didn't surface.

He wasn't too interested in what or who his daughter might love. Right now, it was who the hell this child's mother was. He tried to remember all the faces of the women he'd known in his life, but could only come back with a vague impression of the little face that was even now smiling at him. He tried to tell her to turn her head away, and this time the words came out obligingly enough. Again, she said, "I will, Poppa," but this time turned her back to him. 

He started feeling angry about this. Even though he just now told her not to look at him, he had already forgotten speaking to her. A daughter who turned her back on her father was an ungrateful child. He didn't like having his child turn her back on him. The indignity of it.

Here he was sitting, the father of an ungrateful daughter. A man without a wife. Here he sat on his porch while his daughter watched him. It wasn't something he was proud of. Some dim part of him felt that doing such a thing where his daughter could watch was unseemly.  

But, on the face of it, how much worse could it be than kissing an old doll you used to wipe your ass with?  And why did he have to any way? 

Because the whore who'd given him such a curious child had left him. He didn't know what he wanted to do more to the girl's mother, fuck the damn whore or kill her. Or he could do both and save the time of deciding on it. Fair enough.

But her mother's not here.  That bitch! He leapt to his feet and immediately fell backward into his chair and they both crashed into the yard. He pushed himself up off the floor and spat dust from his nostrils. 

The girl was giggling at him. She covered her mouth with her hands and tried to not to stare, but he knew she was giggling at him. Daddy fall down, heheh. 

"Funny I not am, you bitch stupid!" he shouted at her. 

He climbed to his feet, fuming. The girl held her doll tighter to her chest and clenched her face tight together in anticipation. She expected him to beat her. She'd be lucky if it were only that. 

 Considering he could not screw her mother... considering he could not screw her mother... (fucking head was hurting again). 

In fury, he punched himself in the face and bit his lip. 

Considering he could not screw her mother... what was keeping him from screwing her? 

He stopped. "WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT MEAN?!?" he shouted at his own confused thoughts.  

This frightened Mel-Annie horribly. A shouting-daddy was also a hitting-daddy. She was as fast as running deer, running so quickly that she seemed to hover above the ground; faster than a horse, as gracefully as a bird in flight. If she wasn�t so badly scared, she would have found it a beautiful experience. But there was no beauty in running from the hitting-daddy. Noey wooey, Joanie! She was even too scared to find the thought amusing. She knew better than to laugh around her father; most of the time any way. She must have laughed this time. The proof of such a thing was screaming a wide variety of profane and violent things at her at this very minute. Mel-Annie ran and her father didn�t follow her. 

He was angry. Goddamn motherfucking right he was mad. He was mad because that was exactly what he couldn�t do. He had no wife, no mistress, just this stupid little whore who was at the moment running from her own father as if from a leper. 

Even when he was angry, he knew better than to follow his daughter when she ran from him. She�d run from him enough times for even him to realize the futility in such a thing. He didn�t feel like making a fool out of himself (laughably, he didn�t realize that he�d just had done several foolish things by now). 

He wasn�t fucking a leper. Uh� well� maybe he wouldn�t to that sort of thing --- sex with a leper --- if the occasion did arise. (How he could arise to it would be a different story.)  But he himself was not a leper. (He also wasn�t a competent father, but of course he wouldn�t understand that, either.) 

So, with as much dignity as he could muster (KABLAM! a sudden, violent fart exploded from his rectum and deposited a fresh load of shit into his drawers) he carefully slid out of his coveralls and threw the mess disgustedly onto the floor. Let Mrs. I-Love-Kissing-My-Ass-Rag pick that up and clean it. 

He looked in either direction, saw nothing about the same deserted shithole he always saw (somewhere out there, a rabbit or coyote is having itself one hell of a laugh) and made his winding, inebriated way inside of the cabin (only walked into a wall twice, so he must not be too drunk). 

He sat there and waited. And imagined the very adult games he was about to teach that little brat when she finally came home. And she didn�t. And he didn�t.

As I said, �When he found her, Mel-Annie was a young girl.� She came loping out of the underbrush, still as fast as jack rabbit when she collided with him. Well, to put a finer point of it, her head collided with his crotch and he fell to the floor in shock. 

The young girl just yelled, �Daddy-a mad, mister! I�m sorry!� and continued on her way. He stood, brushed himself off, swallowing the pain. He admired her for that; having wounded him at unawares and surprise. Few things surprised the one named Raven�s Feather. But this girl on their first meeting had. So it wasn�t the daughter who he visited his wrath upon, but the father.

It had been the man�s thoughts, buzzing away in Raven�s head which lead him to this small house in the clearing. The father had leapt from the shadows, placing both hands upon Raven�s shoulders as soon as the young man had stepped in the door. Clearly the randy coward had thought it to be his daughter to step through the door. 

It was for these sins that Raven�s quick hands found themselves behind the man�s ears and thrown him into the corner. Well, such was his surprise at being surprised by the galoot that Raven had actually torn the man�s foul head from his evil fouler body and hiked it like a football. Surprise because he hadn�t known he possesed the strength to do such a thing, even when in the grips of shock. 

So it was that Mel-Annie�s father�s lessons hadn�t been taught. But the young girl would learn much from this particulair man and a mutual hatred would for another would flower in her heart. His hatred became hers and hers his.

Excerpts from Henry David Thoreau�s (1817-1862) "Civil Disobedience."


"The government itself, which is only the mode which the people have chosen to execute their will, is equally liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it. Witness the present Mexican war, the work of comparatively a few individuals using the standing government as their tool; for, in the outset, the people would not have consented to this measure." ... It has not the vitality and force of a single living man; for a single man can bend it to his will. It is a sort of wooden gun to the people themselves. But it is not the less necessary for this; for the people must have some complicated machinery or other, and hear its din, to satisfy that idea of government which they have. Governments show thus how successfully men can be imposed on, even impose on themselves, for their own advantage. ...

... For government is an expedient by which men would fain succeed in letting one another alone; and, as has been said, when it is most expedient, the governed are most let alone by it.�Trade and commerce, if they were not made of India rubber, would never manage to bounce over the obstacles which legislators are continually putting in their way; and, if one were to judge these men wholly by the effects of their actions, and not partly by their intentions, they would deserve to be classed and punished with those mischievous persons who put obstructions on the railroads. ...
... Law never made men a whit more just; and, by means of their respect for it, even the well-disposed are daily made the agents of injustice. A common and natural result of an undue respect for law is, that you may see a file of soldiers, colonel, captain, corporal, privates, powder-monkeys, and all, marching in admirable order over hill and dale to the wars, against their wills, ay, against their common sense and consciences, which makes it very steep marching indeed, and produces a palpitation of the heart. They have no doubt that it is a damnable business in which they are concerned; they are all peaceably inclined.

... Now, what are they? Men at all? or small movable forts and magazines, at the service of some unscrupulous man in power?� In most cases there is no free exercise whatever of the judgment or of the moral sense; but they put themselves on a level with wood and earth and stones; and wooden men can perhaps be manufactured that will serve the purpose as well. Such command no more respect than men of straw or a lump of dirt. They have the same sort of worth only as horses and dogs. Yet such as these even are commonly esteemed good citizens.

--- Excerpts from Henry David Thoreau�s (1817-1862) "Civil Disobedience."

Default Let me introduce you to J. Michael Straczynski
List of Spiderman comics he's worked on.

"Worlds of JMS."

Now answer some questions.

How many Marvel comics have you written that have been published?
(He's written the ones listed above. And you'll notice he hasn't just written "Sins Past" which is only six issues long.)

How many TV shows have you created that have actually aired?
(He's created Babylon 5.)

So I really find it ludicrous how people are judging him on six issues of forty-six. (Forty-two not counting the "Skin Deep".) That's like what?

6/42 or 0.14285714285714285714285714285714. Okay, so I'm a little rusty on my math, but that's 14% isn't it?

And the people doing the judging are comic readers not comic writers. You've been reading comics for fifteen or twenty years and don't like 14% of a professional's work so you're committing yourself to flaming him online every chance you get. My heart bleeds for you.

Since when is it okay to judge a person negatively because of 14% of their work. "Hey, 86% of your stuff has been good, but the last 14% has been bad so I'm giving you an F." You'd support a teacher using this hair-brained rationale to grade tests? I didn't think so. And that's only talking about his "Amazing Spiderman" work. He's done far more than that.

Let me re-state this. You've been paying money to read Marvel's comics and Marvel never paid you to do anything for them. Money is being withdrawn from your account and deposited into Marvel's. You have your name on your checks and JMS has his name on 42 comic books as crediting him as "writer."

Oh, but JMS dared to mess with continuity of a Golden Age story. Something dozens if not hundreds of comic book writers wouldn't dare to do. I guess the word for this is bravery. The man has guts. I for one respect this.

Just trying to impress upon the people who disliked the story is that if they think they can write better stories, they should. Wasting their energies with hostility & grudges when they can be using that energy for creative expression is completely unhealthy.

Making a better mouse trap = good.

Screaming obscenities at someone else who made a "defective"
mouse trap = bad.

How did Todd McFarlaine get a career? By thinking he could make a better comic book character than either Batman or Spiderman so he created & published Spawn. Now he's a very well-respected big-shot artist. He believed in his abilities and DID SOMETHING ABOUT IT in an attempt to prove he could do a better job.

How did Trey Parker & Matt Stone get famous? By doing the "Spirit of Christmas" animated short & constantly showing it around until someone in authority in the entertainment industry (Comedy Central) noticed them.

Wanna be like George Lucas or Kevin Smith or Bob Kane or Woody Allen etc. etc. etc.? Then perfect whatever creative impulses you have and jam your foot in the door.

Flawless? So you're saying tests should be graded as 100% passing and anything below that should be a failing grade? I completely don't understand this obsession with "perfection" that our culture has.

I don't want a flawless record. In point of fact, I don't even want a record. I just want to live my life as a human being and not a machine.

I have the strictest confidence in you, Corp. I'm not trying to force you to like something and I'm not seriously trying to shame you for disliking something. Just trying to inspire you to do something what talents you have and to stop being a curmudgeon.


Curmudgeons don't get anywhere really special in life. They just remain stuck in an unhappy rut. Don't frown.

Want to rise above it? Be happy and do your best to best person you can be. Don't let your anger drive you to the Dark Side. Smile!

Marvel liked the sales he generated, I'm sure. The fact of the matter is, Marvel doesn't care about quality. They care about sales. I've just started to accept that fact.
I'm looking forward to seeing your name on a Dark Horse or Image comic (or something). Wanna get back at Marvel for forsaking what you think is important? Create something of your own that far surpasses their quality. Or join a team that believes in the same things you believe in.

In point of fact, I believe in the potential of everyone here. Toss those frowns in the trash and keep on thinking sunny thoughts.

Initially Steranko filled in layouts created by Marvel workhorse Kirby, but soon took over the series and began to play with his new medium in surprising and innovative ways. Steranko emphasized the series' sci-fi aspects, employing an amazing variety of graphic tricks including unusual points of view, moire screens and Benday dots, and completely reorganizing the composition of frames on the page. The Fury strip turned into a tour de force of graphic effects that had never been so thoroughly explored in the comics. His work became a major influence on contemporary comix artists.

He used unusual points of view?
Completely reorganized composition of frames on a page?

HOW DARE HE!?!?!?!

Everyone knows you're supposed to do everything like everyone else does it. You're supposed to not stand apart from the crowd! You're supposed to not get noticed! You're NOT supposed to do things that undermine your predecessors!!!!!

What a lousy crumb-bum!!!
GRRRR!!!!

He makes me SICK! SICK!! SICK!!!


(Little play-acting exercise.)
(Don't worry. I'm out of let-me-introduce-you-to ideas for threads.)


What are the chances fifteen to twenty years from now, people would still be grousing about Bendis & JMS? They might still hate the guys, but they'll remember the names and tell other people about 'em.

On the contrary, these two threads have been rather devoid of idiocy. You like Steranko, but when someone posts a thread to honor him, you question that person's intellect. I figured it was a fair comparison to make.

It might surprise you to learn Steranko hadn't gotten his due amount of respect when he'd worked on his Marvel stuff. His editors hassled him. He'd made his mark, quit Marvel after a short interval because he wasn't getting what he wanted out of it. I'm sure there were many fans in his day that were critical of him.

It's also unfortunate how little respect fans have for writers. Oh, the artist isn't to be blamed for anything. The artist will draw something beautifully but if a favorite hero is acting impulsivley & gets injured, people scream they want the writer's head on a spit. The writer isn't the boss, he can't force an artist to draw something he doesn't want to. So they work as a team, the finished product comes out and.... the writer gets dissed to heck & back while the other guys who worked on the comic are hardly noticed.

Or maybe people will insult the artist for working with a disliked writer... it's absurd.

Not necessarily one particulair scene. Just every time I pick up a Marvel comic, I always seem to find a completely lazy writer writing dialouge out of his butt while the artist does his absolute best to draw all kinds of wacky, ubiquitous action. Why? "BECAUSE IT LOOKS COOL!"

It really smacks of a poor imitation of what a movie could do. There's obviously lots of examples out there... but basically I have to say "the more captions the better." Captions that express inner-workings of the main hero's mind. It's a shame that I'm a word-person but I can't adequately use 'em to explain what exactly I'm trying to convey. I generally read all the words on a page, savor them, then maybe glance at the artist's drawings. I'm pretty sure to an extent I might enjoy reading the script of a comic more than I'd like reading the actual finished product.

Off-topic:
I don't believe that a writer would write down every little action he wants to have done in a comic. And let me tell you from experience, I've been majorly blocked with writer's block for two or three years because I'm always sweating the small stuff. I'm worrying about how difficult it is for me to come up with names. What really awesome super-powers a bunch of chars could have. Oh, I don't know anything about Vietnam! I have to do some research some day!

Writing was a lot easier before I started using MS Word. I'm forever worrying about which font to use. Re-sizing the text size... and I'd get stuck with the limitations of the software... it was a lot easier when I typed everything out using a basic text-only program. And the INTERNET! Man! That's killing my creative side! It's SO easy to use this medium that I don't want to use the boring junk. Who wants to sit there by myself when I can be communicating online about all kinds of drivel?

So you're saying the artist is an underling who can't stand up to mean, old editor & writer? I find that pretty hard to believe. But anyway, we are talking about a comic book!!!

Issue two to be exact! Aye carumba! I haven't read many of these I have to admit. Okay, but in Issue 2, Spiderman gets his arm broken by Jigsaw. Maybe in page 6 of issue 2, we'll get an explanation for Spiderman's being weakened. Maybe in Issue 7, Spiderman's going to beat up Jigsaw & give him an incredible arse-kicking.

It's like, hey! To put it simply, Peter Parker is sorta like Clark Kent. But the difference is he's a far more humble and fleshed-out character. He's definitely NOT Superman. (That's pretty much Captain America's job to an extent.) What makes Peter stand-out from Clark is that Peter has the world's absolute worst luck in the world. He's never had it easy. Every fight he's been in since he was created has never been one-sided completely in his favor. In point of fact, I really don't believe the highlight of the comics are the Spiderman parts. The highlight is Peter! Compared to Peter, Bruce & Clark are spoiled rotten. Clark's always loved Lois Lane. Peter's destiny was never that simple.

I would have to say I don't want to read a Spiderman comic where Spiderman is working at 100% maximum efficency & is kicking the crud out of villains with the greatest of ease like Superman busting two bit hoods. I love his being fallible. I love his wise-cracks to a certain extent. (Although I have to say I never understood what the humor in his jokes were.)

If Flash Thompson were Spiderman, the character wouldn't have lasted for forty years. What's enduring about it is that Peter was a nerd who endured, who survived, and he became a teacher. He's very fortunate enough to be married to a woman who is an aspiring actress. He's a decent guy I respect. I have to say one of the main reasons I hated the Superman character for many years is because Clark Kent IS NOT a realistic portrayal of a nerd. Mild-mannered he may be, but he's a six foot tall, barrel-chested, square-jawed guy who disguises his identity with glasses! That's so lame!

2/20/2005

I find it startling how obstinate & stubborn religious-indocrinated people are. Ideas and concepts are set-in-stone. They refuse to listen to anyone who isn�t a recognized authority figure. �You haven�t got a degree, why should I listen to you?�

They learn by memorization and rote. Everything they read, they read with the goal of memorizing it. They can�t just read something to relax, kill some time. Case in point: the bible. They find such pride in rattling off memorized sections of it. I-can-recite-from-memory-and-you-can�t. But interestingly, as I was keeping track of the segment recited to me, I casually mentioned the fact they�d messed up somewhere. The books are things written on paper. Real life isn�t Mission Impossible. Books aren�t going to self-destruct. You can read one at your liesure at your own pace.

But the indocrination of school that insists we read 100 pages in a week for an assignment turns us off of reading. Reading is also not very necessary for daily life. Math is because we have to use it to keep track of our money. But I can glance at a word and the exact second that I look at it be able to read what the word is. I�m a fast-reader. A constant one as well. But anyhow� religious people seem to take every idea and concept that enters into their mind and do some sort of Houdini trick with it. Put it the idea and concept in a strait jacket, lock it into a metal chest, pour concrete on top of the metal chest, and then toss the whole thing into a frozen lake within their minds. And for good measure infest the frozen lake with� well, you see how extreme the metaphor is getting for yourself. Immutable facts. Absolutes.

Well, so many of the white population in America seem to be staunch racists. They learn to read-and-write English as children. English-is-the-official-language-of-America. And their most common complaint of non-white people? �They don�t speak English!� Does it ever dawn upon the white person that their not being able to speak any other language besides English isn�t very impressive either? No way. I�ve often said that I believe being bilingual makes a person twice as smart. No sarcasm. I cannot read any Asian dialects, but I do know that Japanese atleast is based upon pictographs much like the Egyptian hieroglyphs. (Draw little picture that looks like a house rather than write H-O-U-S-E with letters. So we�ve got the written Japanese, we�ve also got it transferred into phonetic Romanian letters --- English & other European languages based upon this --- to get �domo arigato�, spoken Japanese to speak the sounds, and finally an English translation of �Thank You.�)

Mention �German� to a white person in America. You get mentions of �Nazis.� Mention Japanese, you might get a reference to �Pearl Harbor.� There�s more to either nationality than what happened in World War II, but America is a nation saturated in these concepts. Without straying too far from my point (I�m not even sure if I had one to begin with) the Pledge of Allegiance is interesting. �I Pledge Allegiance�� and �One Nation Under God�� I�ve noticed very often that the country can be VERY divisible despite the fact that the Pledge says it isn�t and not everyone is allowed liberty and justice. Only certain people. As a certain facist college teacher I�ve heard say, �We�d like to think we�ve Equal Opportunity in our country, but we haven�t. Only a certain people who are fortunate enough to be born into a certain place are. If you�re born poor, you�ll stay poor. If you�re born wealthy, you�ll stay wealthy.� And certainly there�s quite a few people who find themselves pridefully reinforcing the class system at every opportunity. No matter what their gender or race. Interestingly I was born in an affluent suburb, so I was Middle Class wealthy yet due to many things, I�m rather poor.

Personally, I�m a uniter. I unite ideas, I speak with every person I come into contact with. Why are people so remarkably specific? �I�m sorry, the woman you need to talk to is not in the office right now. Call back Monday.� What the hell is your job, bitch, sit on your ass all day and tell people when they call this same spiel? The specific person in the entire office whose job it is to do something (presumably whatever task a caller asks about is this �job�) is never in the office. It ticks me off to hear this excuse, but I don�t bother saying anything. Just decide �I hate calling these office morons� and let whatever problem I had fester. A person isn�t more important just because they work in an office. Just because they are on the side of the desk where the least amount of work is accomplished by the least capable employees available while the people who COULD do the job and are denied the opportunity to do so are regulated as being �lowly irritating pests.�

Honestly, the people of the suburbs (in my life�s experience) are the most useless people alive in the world. Because they are pampered, spoiled children with every advantage who haven�t earned a single one of them. A person born in an affluent suburb of white parents and lives their entire life in this affluent suburb quite honestly cares far too much for themselves than what is healthy. I find it amusing that most people at the first sighting of me would find it nearly impossible to believe I actually lived there at all.

Mute, I re-inforce that person�s feeling of vast superiority over me. When I fully articulate myself, I immediately crush that person�s ego & send them into a downward spiral of inferiority. Because I�m just so much smarter than they are and so much more capable of expressing myself than they. That because I�m not afraid to be honest & open with people about my beliefs. While the majority of people only seem to think about how much what they eat, wear, or own costs in comparisson to the people around them eat, wear, or own costs, I am constantly considering concepts they�d find nearly impossible to comprehend. Why? Because they purposefully limit the reach of their imaginations. When-I-was-your-age-I� When you were my age it was 2004? No? Then how exactly does that compute? It doesn�t.

I really fucking hate geeks. All the trivial bullshit they hold sacred. Now don�t get me wrong, I�m a geek. But let me give you an example annoying geek behaviour.
People who get a hate on over a movie that is inspired by their favorite comicbook. They expect the movie to duplicate every miniscule detail of the comicbook. The story �continuity.� The costumes the chars wear. The secret identities of the chars. All the stupid conventions. They mistakenly believe that comic fans are the only ones who potentially watch the movie. And they will be unforgivingly critical of every thing. Hey, morons! It costs a crap load of money to make a big budget Hollywood movie. I guess it�s too much to expect for the audience to understand the creative process.
Movies are more stringently regulated than comics. Many people contend that in order for a movie to be �good� it has to have an R-rating. But an R-rating at times can alienate potential viewers. Even if the moviemakers manage to trim down a lot of the content for a PG-13 or PG rating with the intention of saving the �good stuff� for a DVD release, the consumer might not be able to get it. Like it or not, Disney-type products that have G-rated content are more likely to sell to the larger audience. A studio could lose money from making a movie based upon a comicbook char that the general audience at large might not know about or care about. But �Care Bears Meet The Smurfs� would be gang-busters all 
around & net in a great deal of profit.

This honestly isn�t a useful exercise. As for myself, I suppose you would call me somewhat of an enigma. I�m sure many people have many interests. When it comes to fiction, I have to say I appreciate many disparate author�s works. George Orwell (1984 & Animal Farm), John Stienbeck (especially Grapes of Wrath), Katherine Dunn�s Geek Love, J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis (can�t believe the man was a best friend to JRRT & yet his own Chronicles of Narnia is so blah), Michael Crichton, Dean Koontz, Mary Shelley�s Frankenstien, Stephen King, etc. I mostly enjoy horror. Give me something dark, visceral, descriptive. Anyhow, I realize I haven�t read many books written by women. I really like reading feminist magazines. I�ve read some �chick books� & was thoroughly entertained. Lately, I have been over-endulging in reading comic books.

I prefer Batman because he�s dark. He broods. I can�t say I�ve read many of Shakespeare�s comedies or sonnets, but I like his tragedies. But I also don�t mind reading a little Green Arrow. I�m thoroghly impressed with all the territory that manga encompasses. Manga has a tendency to have realistic settings & chars who aren�t too far removed from ordinary. There might be a small twist where this one char might be a sorceror or a samurai or something, but that twist isn�t the whole of the char�s existence.
�Hey! I�m the Flash! I can run fast! Watch me run fast in public while I wear these red pajamas! Wee! I run fast! I�m impatient! Ooops! Now I have to wear civvies. I can only move fast when nobody else is around or else I�ll give away my SECRET� IDENTITY. I�m a chemist! Look at me do chemistry-type stuff! Here is me, doing chemistry stuff! Chemistry stuff is so boring. I can�t wait until I get to put on my red pajamas! Then I can run fast. And people will watch me run fast. Yep, I get to run fast in public when I�m wearing my red pajamas.�
God, I hate that guy! Anyhow, one of the amusing things about Dragon Ball Z is that the chars in that show have no pretentions about secret identities. Goku�s married. He and his wife & kid Gohan live out in the boonies. He and just every one of the heroes can fly like Superman. Heck, they can toss energy projectile beams like in Street Fighter II. (The beams are powered by chi.) There�s no pretension about �secret identities.� Fact is nobody really seems to realize they�re heroes because Mr. Satan (�Hercule� in America) hogs the glory. Hercule has no super-powers, but he blusters & self-promotes. He�s a basically a culmination of every American professional wrestler (with a huge helping of Hulkamania) into one char. If you consider bragging to be ability, Hercule is the grandmaster. Another un-super character on the show is the fat, lazy Yajarobie. He�s got a katana. I�m not sure if he�s a samurai or merely pretends to be one. He�s cowardly, like Hercule.
Another interesting part about DBZ is that not all villains are villains forever. Vegetta had been the main baddie during the �Saiyan Saga.� During the �Namek Saga� he searched for the Namek Dragon Balls so he could become immortal. He made a tenuous alliance with Gohan & Krillin so they could fight the Ginyu Force & Frieza. Afterward, Vegetta pretty much mellowed out & made an alliance with the good guys. He isn�t a good guy because he�s surly, bitter, & hostile. But he likes to fight and likes the odds when it comes to being part of a group of heroes ganking a single, nearly invincible nemesis. Heck, he even married Bulma --- that chick is nearly as cranky as he is --- and fathered the half-saiyan Trunks.
What I don�t like is how DBZ tends to re-enact the same basic setup. The Z-game is fighting this amazing bad guy who none of them seem capable of defeating. The bad guy takes nearly twenty episodes to fight. The bad guy can upgrade his abilities. Yawn. Frieza. Yawn. Cell. Yawn. Buu. Hm. I loved Buu... the fat, candy-obsessed one with the puffy pants. I hated the green dude who bossed him around, though. Anyway, Evil Buu was a wanker. Crud, Frieza was okay because he gave off that disquieting effeminate vibe... he pursed his lips & blew some air, causing major damage at one time. He was scary in that he seemed to be a flaming queer. A flaming queer who could make you explode into a million pieces with a limp-wristed bitch-slamp. Then he wraps his tail around Vegetta�s neck, strangling him, while he laid into Vegetta�s kidneys with a few dozen hard rabbit punches. YOWCH! But the rest of the bad guys were (with the exception of Buu) shites.
Anyhow. As like most people, I have a variety of tastes. Hrum. I can�t say I enjoy how women are expoited in many gaming magazines (mags). Well, essentially that�s the problem. They aren�t women. They�re TITS & ASS. They haven�t got personalities, they don�t speak. The mags just have an over-abundance T&A that have almost nothing to do with the product at all. �HEY! Let�s put some T&A in this puzzle game! It�ll sell more!� Oh, let�s show gratuitious T&A and then toss in some blurb about �sexy girls� in the middle of paragraph. This sort of attitude is pathetic. It�s almost a desperate attempt of these churlish lads to assert their own heterosexuality by jamming in as much insufferably insipid eye candy as possible. Mammaries. Yay. As if I really cared. All these guys walking around who have shrivelled little balls the size of marbles who like to insist their nuts are as big as the tires on monster trucks. Honestly, I�m not impressed fellas. The gals will agree with me, I do hope. Hey, I can�t be the only hetero dude out there who isn�t a wanker, now can I?

On a side-note, I have say I appreciate the use of pictures of women wearing bikinis in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. In this particular case, the content is appropriate & amusing. The Navy crew on the tanker level presumably have been out to sea for a rather long time. It�s an entirely male crew, so I don�t begrudge them for hiding girlie pictures in their lockers. In fact, it�s fun to go around a level in the game, tranquilize all the guards in the area. Once they�re all tranquilized, kill each of the guards with a shot to groin or the head. Heck, empty a few dozen clips into them & watch the blood splatter on the floor as they�re lifeless bodies twitch. When you�re through, toss them into a locker. Hmmm... why is it after you�ve killed a guard, you still feel a pulse when you pick up his body? Anyhow, there aren�t many women in MGS 2. There�s Olga, a Russian chick with hairy armpits and a crew cut. She also has a knife with a gun in it�s handle. Oh, and before you speculate that she�s a dyke, she does mention being pregnant. Interestingly, there�s even a Romanian vampire guy named, well, Vamp who has an odd relationship with the other female villain whose name is Fortune. Vamp drinks blood, is impervious to bullets (he gets shot in the head and he gets up) and he�s also bisexual. Fortune laments how her luck causes bullets to be deflected by an invisible aura around her. She wants to die, but her fortune won�t allow it. Her heart�s even on the right side... Fatman is demolitions expert who runs about on roller-skates & has an fetish with his hands. His hands are slim & well-manicured, but the rest of him is grotesquely fat. Anyhow, the other female char is Rose. She�s the girlfriend of Raiden (aka �Jack� aka �Jack the Ripper�). Rose & Raiden�s banter on the radio is rather realistic. I thoroughly enjoyed learning all those tidbits through listening to the chars interact with each other. Impressive attention to detail. Oh... there�s a guard. * TRANGS * * SHOOTS FIFTY BULLETS INTO UNCONCIOUS GUARD�S CROTCH * :D
It gets to be tiresome how comic book chars --- especially the ones done by Marvel --- seem to have all the men with cookie-cutter buff bodies & the women have gigantic tities with runner bods. Okay, maybe not gigantic. But the breasts don�t really range very far in size. In a recent issue of Robin, Tim Drake dresses in drag. We don�t know at first it�s him. We just see a girl with brown hair. A tall guy comes over & asks her some questions. She offers a lame excuse. Rather than be suspicious, the guy awkwardly makes a pass at him. Once the girl gets into the room where she�d wanted to go, she speaks over a com-link to Alfred & reveals herself to be Tim Drake. The first thing he does is to complain that Alfred had made his fake boobs too big. Alfred disagrees. He just felt that Tim could benefit from some under-cover work & he was too young to pose as a male. The female guise was the only practical solution. And no, the boobs aren�t too big. This exchange relieves a tremendous amount of tension that had been built up previous to that issue of Robin. Why weren�t there any females at hand to do the operation? Stephanie Brown (aka Spoiler who�d also had a short run as a female Robin) had been killed in the War Games cross-over. She had been Robin�s girlfriend. Another girlfriend of Tim�s, Darla, was the daughter of a mobster and she�d also bitten the dust. Around about the same time, Tim�s father was killed in his own house in Identity Crisis # 5. So seeing Tim being skeeved off by an older man flirting with him & have to wear falsies is much appreciated.
Another failing of Marvel is much of the dialouge the chars have seems to feature gratuitious product placements for real-world products. And the settings are in real-world locations. For me, these ingredients are unwelcome as laxative in a cheeseburger.
Gail Simone, the writer for Birds of Prey, quite aptly states �It�s true that, in a lot of comics, the idea of showing a tough woman just seems to mean putting breasts on male characters. Being cranky doesn�t mean being powerful in my book.� I feel this applies quite well. Batman�s this guy who wanders about Gotham at night wearing an animal costume. He nimbly leaps around roof-tops. Catwoman�s this chick who wanders about Gotham at night wearing an animal costume. She nimbly leaps around roof-tops. Batman has a tenuous relationship with the police in Gotham. Catwoman has a tenuous relationship with the police in Gotham. Surprise, surprise, they�re compatible. (Of course when she isn�t guest-starring in a Batman comic, Catwoman�s feminie side comes to play.)
Superman�s this strong guy who can fly. Wonder Woman�s this strong girl can fly. The differences between them are marginal. Superman has oodles of super-powers besides his strength & flight. He can deflect bullets just by standing still & lettiing them bounce off his body. Wonder Woman can deflect bullets by using her metal wrist guards. She also has a lasso. But fundamentally, they�re two halves of the same whole. When it comes to dealing with others, they both tend to be assertive & think they should lead since they share being the strongest means they should be heard.� And Wonder Woman�s lack of feminity & gruffness is easily excused by her being an Amazon warrior from an island populated solely by women.

Let me tell you the most beautiful thing I ever saw in my life. It involves a stray cat. Actually a kitten. The cat was outside my sister�s bedroom window (she was living with I and my parents in some rather confusing period of my life I can�t exactly remember very well*) During one night, my sister�s sleep was broken by a crying kitten outside her window. Her bedroom was below-ground so that the window was level with the grass outside. She pitied the poor thing and went outside to investigate.

The cat was deformed. It�s head was too large because spinal fluid flooded it�s skull & wouldn�t go properly along it�s spine to the extermities. Or maybe it�s head was just too big for it�s small body to hold up. I honestly have no idea how far that little kitten must have walked before it had gotten to my sister�s window. Walked? The litle thing couldn�t walk. It must have crawled. Imagine a scrawny, starving kitten with a head vaguely the size of a potato crawling for a block before anyone took notice it in the dead of the night. When was it born? Where was it born? Those are life�s little mysteries. Is that kitten the beautiful thing? Nah. I guess you�d say it was the �brave thing.� Now let me finish!

My sister brought that little kitten into the house, named it Gizmo after that little adorable mogwi in the Gremlins movies. Probably because of how they made similiar sounds. I can still see that kitten even now as I�m typing. Just a few moments ago I was weeping at the memory of its plight. Since it couldn�t walk on it�s own, we tried putting an empty toilet paper roll under it. The kitten rolled a few adorable steps, then collapsed. Wahled. We tried again.

Now I never liked cats. Concieted, proudful, useless things. You do not own a cat, it owns you. What else would you call a creature that poops in a box & expects YOU to clean up it�s mess besides �Master�? There�s no such thing as a cat-owner. Just people-owned-by-cats. But that kitten should it have lived might have made a very interesting pet. But, someone had decided the humane thing to do was to take it to the vet to euphanized. I�m not sure if that was a few days later or the next day or a week later. But seeing my sister trying to give that little kitten�s last few moments of life a little dignity & respect. That was beautiful. I remember thinking my sister was the only good person I�d ever met in my entire life.

With all my years of being the hapless victim of cruel, sadistic bullies as a youth, I knew well enough that there WAS evil in the world. Enough to fill entire oceans with it. But that spoonful of goodness my sister showed to that cat sure balanced things out in my rather limited view of the world. I remembered thinking my sister would make Eowyn & Luthien Tinuviel look like Cruella DeVille & The Wicked Witch of the West by contrast. But I was too busy trying to solve Final Fantasy VI to begin to formulate a half-way comprehensible way to tell her. Ah, she knew she was a beautiful human being. What was the point of telling her something she already knew?

Well, right now my sister is the mother of two really great kids. My nieces... well what can I say but the eldest is the smartest person I�ve ever met in my life? She�s very forth-right & honest. Every time she talks to me I�m left staggered & speechless at how profound what she�d just said was. How is it possible that a little girl who isn�t even ten years old could be smarter than Hillary Freaking Rodham Clinton? Because she�s my sister�s daughter. The little tyke scares me... Must we wait thirty more years before this kid gets sworn into the White House? Will America still be a democracy at that point in time?

Forgive me, sis, if I wish your daughter should be the fifth female president. I don�t think I can wait for thirty years for her to be the first.

* Dad was well into his cups; mom was well into denial & enabling his saucy disposition towards getting sauced; and I was transfixed with my own obsession with Super Nintendo,� horror novels, & Lord of the Rings. I mean, why not? The stuff of our lives was a horror story that made The Shining seem like the sisiest theme park ride in Disney World. What in the world was was my sister doing? I guess she was busy being the only one of us who wasn�t a complete nutjob. Who cares about what was going on in my parent�s house when I was spellbound with Traveling Jack�s journeys in The Territories & across America in the Talisman to find a magical cure for his mother�s cancer?� Certainly not me.

Interesting. You know, I often times find it rather frustrating how little progress there seems to be within the comic book continuum. Revision, to my eyes, is met with scorn & ridicule. Honestly, they are ignoring one of the central pillars of fiction. The Suspension of Diselief. Instead of witholding disbelief, they are wrapping themselves up in cloaks it as if were some sort of virtue. Well, if Ignorance is Bliss, then such people must be profoundly, blessedly blissful (meaning: very stupid). As one scrawny worthy had often times re-iterated to my ear some years ago, such people can �suck my left testicle!�

Granted, the reading of comic books is hardly an exercise of the intellect. Rather, I see it as a interesting diversion. A happy little respite from reading a newspaper or magazine. (I hate such periodicals. Decadent, moronic, caustic filth. The things should be printed on toilet paper, the better to facilitate my using them to my ass with because the very last thing a newspaper or magazine could do is provide one with information about the real world in real way. Thanks, but I prefer Yahoo News, CNN.COM, MSNBC.COM, etc. for that sort of thing.) Comic books are a fine thing to read for fun. Sometimes they prove to be almost like mini-TV shows (more at sitcom or crime show than cartoons to be truthful) or in some wonderful cases like mini-novels. Novels. Now those make me smile. From John Steinbeck to Katherine Dunn to Tad Williams to well, others. I don�t want to belabor with listing my favorites. That�d probably be a different article.

These days, the Catwoman film with Halle Berry (the haters call it �Catwoman In Name Only� or CINO), The Batman cartoon (aka �The�), the two Joel Schumaker Batman films, the Teen Titans cartoon are all universally reviled by DC fans. Marvel seems to be undergoing a Renaissance these days with two X-Men, three Blade, two Spiderman, Punisher, Daredevil, and Hulk making their way into theatres. Granted, every item of fiction that transitions from one medium to another is bound to have changes.
(The differences between the Lord of the Rings live-action movies and J.R. Tolkien�s book trilogy from which they spawned are staggering to say the least.)

Many times these changes are good. In Peter Benchley�s book, the killer shark wreaks the boat and the two surviving shark-hunters are mercifully left alive while the monster menace they had been chasing leaves them alone. Hm. It�s possible that the book had been a modern-day retelling of Moby Dick, with the whale being replaced with a shark. (Never actually read Moby Dick and my memory of the TV movie starring Patrick Stewart is fuzzy at best.) Anyhow, this ending sucks. The movie ends with the shark being blown to smithereens. Much better ending. Although that�s the different between literature and movies, isn�t it? Literature says �don�t mess with nature or it�ll kick your ass� and action movies say �don�t mess with the good guy or he�ll kick your ass.�

Most of the time, the changes are bad. In Stephen King�s IT,� it was essentially shapeless entity who --- in a homage to J.R.R T�s Shelob --- was a giant spider. It was whatever its victims were afraid of. In the case of Beverly, she was afraid of growing into womanhood, so the blood spouting from the bathroom sink appropriately symbolized menstruation. Her father couldn�t see the blood because he ostensibly refused to recognize the fact his daughter were anything more than an insignifigant girl. Her friends could see the blood because of their strong spiritual bond with each other and also because they respected her flowering maturity. Beverly�s father was an abuser and she had ran from him because he began to suspect she�d lost her virginity to her friends --- such was the extent of the man�s lacking in scrupples, he honestly thought the only things a group of boys would want for a girl would be sexual in nature --- and she has the misfortune of picking a hiding place where a group of bullies are playing secret games of their own. To her profound amazement, her first glimpse of the male genitalia is watching these bullies standing in a circle with their pants down and in lighting each other�s farts. Later on in the book, Beverly teaches her six friends learn how to �fly� in the depths of the sewers as she gives herself to each of them. They had just faced off against a horrible monster and very well could have died from being lost in the mazes of the monster�s lair. The reasoning behind Beverly�s sacrifice is her realization that It was also sex and therefore they had to confront the beast in that way as well.

Sadly, the movie version of IT was dreadful. The various forms of It were shuffled around so that wrong boy faced the wrong variation of the demon and many people scoff �who is afraid of clowns, for Pete�s sake?� (I wonder how many circus clowns have been criminals on the lamb. Who knows? Maybe that cartwheeling buffoon is really an escaped murderer?) But anyway, that wasn�t the point. It had chosen the clown facade because It felt this was an innocuous disguise. So we aren�t supposed to be afraid a clowns, dumb-dumb! (Another homage to Tolkien is how the little boat made from newspaper is meant to symbolize the funeral boat Boromir�s body had been placed in.)

Thankfully, the transition from a comic to the movie screen at times are mild. Just don�t expect the hardcore comic-nazi to be thankful.

Beneath the radar of the main-stream, Batman and then Superman were given Animated Series treatment in the 90s. (Batman: The Animated Series shall be B-TAS & Superman: The Animated Series shall be S-TAS.) Marvel�s Spiderman on the other hand couldn�t figure out if it was a cartoon or an Animated Series. While B & S rarely guest-starred on each other�s show, nearly every Spiderman episode had Spidey playing second-fiddle to some ridiculous guest-star. Sometimes X-Men, sometimes Daredevil, sometimes Blade, sometimes The Punisher, even Captain America.

Anyhow, there were multiple changes apparent in B-TAS & S-TAS. (I�m not very well-versed in Superman, so I�ll let someone else enumerate those.) For one, B-TAS granted the characteristics to Jason Todd of the comics to it�s own version of Tim Drake. Jason Todd of the comic had been murdered by Joker. Tim Drake of the comic had a father who was an alcoholic. Since killing a character as important as Robin would not have been feasible in animated program ostensibly meant for children, the third Robin replaced the second Robin as the first Robin�s little buddy. (Dick Grayson in the comics had become Nightwing.)

Another wrinkle of the Robin legacy comes in the form of the insipid misconception that there was something gay going on Wayne Manor between Bruce & Dick. Robin was the original teenage side-kick. His creation had been meant to mellow Batman from a vengeful, angry pyscopath of his earliest incarnation into a proud foster father who�d adopted an orphan. Robin�s bare-legged costume speaks of Peter Pan & Robin Hood. Besides, the kid was also an acrobat & circus people certainly dress funny as it is. Sadly, even this change back-fired. A closet pediophile named Wertram blamed his unholy obsession with boy-flesh on Robin & wrote a book called Seduction of the Innocent.

The fifties are universally seen as a wholesome decade. But, come on, hello! That was the era that the the baby-boomers were born. Horny soldiers traumatized by the devastation of World War II had come back to America to get married & fucked their ever-loving brains out. So it�s really hypocritical how the squares considered the flower children of the 1960s to be decadent. It doesn�t matter if one is married or not. Sex is sex. And there certainly was no sex in the Batcave.

The live-action Batman TV show had introduced an aunt to alleviate� groundless suspicions. And for whatever reason, a Batgirl was created as well. The aunt ostensibly was Alfred�s hectoring girlfriend who was kept in the dark over the fact Bruce & Dick were Batman &� Robin. And Batgirl was Dick�s girlfriend. Batman himself was smitten like a kitten by Catwoman. (There were three Catwomen through-out the run of the live-action show�s run, none of which were Selina Kyle.) When the aunt was transfered to the comic, she became Leslie Thompkins, a social worker who cared for Gotham�s homeless and a friend to Bruce�s parents. Batgirl became the adopted daughter of Commissioner Jim Gordon (Barbara).

Another interesting change is how Barbara is never paralyzed in B-TAS. Alan Moore�s The Killing Joke had had Joker shooting her through the spine. In B-TAS, she dreams that she had died & her father had sworn a vendetta against Batman. Yet we can�t have overly unpleasant things happen in arena where the censorship-happy vultures normally congregate.

The American culture is a fundamentally illiterate one. It is rather shameful how many people are susceptible by charlatans & hucksters who feign holiness yet are fundamentally money-grubbing leaches. Speaking ofcourse of evangelists. Such people peddle immorality & package it as �morality.� To expect all people be enthralled as slaves to their own diety especially if that other person would dislike to do so.

Well, anyway, changes. It�s quite remarkable how firmly attached people are to the concept that women are beneath men on the totem pole of life. Considering how superhero comics are firmly entrenched within out-moded worship of the masculine archetypes. (Kinda gay, isn�t it?) Superman, Batman, Hawkman, Spiderman. Women are allowed to be super, just not as super as the men are. So Wonder Woman is more Wonder Woman than Wonder Woman.

To be blunt: Who is Wonder Woman? Superman�s bitch. Who is Catwoman? Batman�s bitch.

Of course these are falsehoods. But independant females scare the sensibilities of fanboys. �Oh, Wonder Woman�s so butch because she�s an Amazon from the island of Themyscra where only women warrior lives and she doesn�t know any better. She�s not a lesbian. I mean, look at her totally kissing Superman! Even though she tries to be coy, she�s a complete slut.�� Ah... hrum.

Catwoman presents an interesting case in that her side-kick, Holly, is a lesbian who lives with her lover. It�s no coincidence that she (Catwoman) dresses in leather and carries a whip because she has more of than a little of the dominatrix in her blood.

Michelle Pfeifer (Batman Returns) had presented her version of the character as a frumpy secretary who had been tossed out of window. Halle Berry�s (Catwoman) character was an artist who had sold out so she could design ads for a perfume manufacturer and she dresses poorly. Many fans fixate upon the superficial fact that Pfiefer�s character was named �Selina Kyle� and Berry�s was �Patience Phillips.� They use this as justificaion to launch into hysterics that Gollum would be most proud of. Sadly, niether characters are legit.
It is amusing that Pfeiffer�s secretary is a much better seamstress than Berry�s artist. �Oh, but ofcourse! All women know how to sew! It�s in their blood!� Pardon me while I vomit.

Truthfully, Selina Kyle�s true place in the world is far more somber. The most recent incarnation of her character has her being the daughter of an unemployed alcoholic man who would sit all day in a chair with a blanket over his head because the light harmed his eyes. Her mother had committed suicide by slashing her own wrists. The only kindness her useless father had done for her is to pass away quietly. Afterward, Selina was taken into a home for wayward girls. It was here that she perfected her gymnastic abilities.

Of course, this isn�t certain. Another variation in the comic has her being a prostitute (Frank Miller�s Batman: Year One). Still, Selina is an edgy woman who has lived in dire circumstances in her life She delights in her own abilities and uses her charms to her advantage against the hapless men who come within her path. This lady is a stray that picks her own destiny and is no one�s pet cat.
She does hope to tame the vengeful spirit that drives Batman to continue upon his nearly impossible quest to rid his city of crime & corruption. Batman himself is heavily conflicted by his feelings for her. She is a criminal, a cat burglar to be more precise. At best they have a truce. Selina cannot force Batman to love her and he cannot force her to stop being a criminal. Compromise.

It isn�t too hard to imagine that the obsessive, cynical naysaying fanboys are perhaps heavily orthodox religious types? Inflexible, incapable of exerting their own individuality in a sea of pressures. Vehementy arguing whatever side is populair among their fellow trolls even though each person really doesn�t genuinely believe in such a stance.

Here�s where I break from fact & launch into wild theories.

As it stands, why is it not possible to imagine that there has been more than one Catwoman? Or more than one Batman?

Let�s say that there are several copycats. Many of which take on the dual identities of �Catwoman� & �Selina Kyle.� They aren�t all the same woman.

One Selina is the original black haired one from the comic. She�s a �bored socialite� femme fatale. Her exploits with Batman have been fictionalized in the Bob Kane comic.

In reality, there never had been a Bruce Wayne. Kane had watched Citizen Kane and was struck by how the film portrayed a wealthy man. Considering the fact the film had stolen his name for a purpose he had disapproved of, he set out to revise the movie�s premise. He changed the selfish rich man with the depressing life into a self-less crime fighter. Kane became Wayne, Bruce Wayne.

Wayne was like James Bond in that he had a large assortment of wacky vehicles & inventive toys. But unlike Bond, Wayne would wear a mask & costume, becoming �The Batman� to disguise his identity.

In a rather ridiculous turn of events, Kane decided to invent a side-kick to become companion to Wayne. This side-kick is Dick �Robin� Grayson. �Son� is obvious.� This gives Wayne a foster-son to look after. Without the son, there was very little to distinquish the Dark Knight from the hoods he fought. He was black; a nearly evil hunter who preyed upon criminals. The gray brightens the darkness of Wayne�s spirit. Gives him a reason to cherish life. Even those of his enemies.
But he never completely passes over into the white.

The butler, Alfred, finally enters into the story. How is it that a butler would come AFTER an adopted son into the life of� a wealthy millionaire? It�s silly. Anyhow, Alfred becomes the father figure to Bruce.

Conciously, Alfred is regaded by Bruce as his father�s butler. Subconciously, Bruce respects and loves him although he isn�t willing to accept Alfred as a replacement for the father he�d lost. He never was very close to his father. Mother was his favorite & father was uncomfortable expressing himself to their son. Thomas didn�t like having to be a role-model for his son. He never quite learned how to balance the love he felt with the sterness of a parent.

Anyhow, Bruce over-compensates with his relationship to Dick. He lumps a whole lot of fatherly concern on the child & smothers him.

Although Bruce doesn�t look up to his father or Alfred, he does look up to somebody. In the comic (HUSH), this role-model is Alan Scott whom he�d known distantly. He hadn�t actually� met Scott, was just one among many who worshipped the� (first) Green Lantern from afar. TAS presents the �Gray Ghost� (who is voiced by Adam West) to be the mentor. This character gives the live-action TV Batman a bridge with TAS. Although the SLAM! BAM! is not within the comic�s continuity any more. Niether is TAS.

His relationship with Alfred is colored with resentment that a step-son would feel for his step-dad. Alfred had adopted him. He has a reluctant respect for him.

Alfred, on the other hand, disapproves almost completely with the Batman fixation. He makes this known rather subtly but with great feeling beneath the surface of pithy remarks. He�s trying to wear down Bruce�s resolve & get him to settle down to become a family man with a more useful life. To give up the pretense of using �Bruce Wayne� as an alibi & put more value in this side of himself. Politically or as a surgeon like his father, Bruce has a lot to offer. And the world has a lot to offer Bruce as well.

But anyway, another Catwoman is the blond daughter of the original Selina. She takes her mother�s name & makes herself into an activist who fights for the rights of cats & steals from those who do bad things to felines. She even takes objects that are cat-like.

The third Selina is Michelle Pfeifer�s mentally unhinged Catwoman. (Batman Returns.) Her true name is not �Selina� at all, but she answers to it. It�s her means of breaking apart from the ....

AH!!!!!! The original Catwoman is Cleopatra. Her bloodline passes down through throughout the generations to various Catwomen. Each of them hopes to obtain the queen lifestyle Cleopatra had enjoyed.

Anyhow, I know what you�re thinking: trivial bullshit. If you have reached this point, you must be wondering if I have a point to this story or if I�m wasting your time.

Now let�s put it this way:
If you think along those terms, then I am.

But I sincerely wish that don�t. Time can only be invested. Now how how much time have you truly invested in yourself? In those around you? Truly given?

I am asking in earnest here. I don�t wish to have any negative connotations with what I�m saying here. If my tone has not always been polite, I wish it wasn�t entirely condescending. I care. I sit here, in idle moments of my small, insignifigant to impart what little wisdom or whimsy I have to you here. I do so with the hope you would also speak in honesty.

There aren�t any sacred cows here. Traditional is not the whole essence of our existence. Tonight some one who hadn�t eaten asked me for food & I gave it to him. I gave him sixty dollars so he could pay for food & a place to stay for a couple nights until he�d gotten his pay-check.

Guy had been outside in the rain �all day� & I was the first person willing to pull my head out of my own ass for five minutes to bother with anyone else. Figure I�ll see if a friend of mine who works with folks like the guy could help him out. Indigent people with an iffy home situation. I just feel bad for not being able to rent a room out of a house to the guy. People these days are too busy believing in silly wrong-headed mundane myths to be kind to one another. Not even good myths like the ones in a book or a comic or even in very rare occassions even in TV shows or movies (A Beautiful Mind, Adaptation, Man on the Moon, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Pulp Fiction, Resevoir Dogs, About Schmdt, One Hour Photo, & The Final Cut� are fine examples of celluoid dreams.) I mean stupid shit like: �If you give a bum money, he�ll just buy drugs.� Hey, I give someone money, I do it out of trust they�d do the right thing. If they do the wrong thing, I�m not there to see them do it and it is not my responcibility.

People�s minds are too full with bullshit and don�t realize enough how they might hold themselves & others sacred instead.

The Not-So Incredibles (Inc). The movie the Incredibles is a blatant rip-off of Frank Miller�s The Dark Knight Returns (TDKR) & Alan Moore�s The Watchmen (tWM). Almost. All three are stories of retired superheroes in a world that no longer wants them to exist.

Though it isn�t explained what exactly caused the capes to quit in TDKR, we are given a sense from Superman (Clark) that they�d mostly gone quietly into the dark. Clark stays on as a covert agent of the gov�t who kicks ass for Reagan where his President needs him. His equivalent is The Comedian of
tWM

Batman (Bruce), however, is haunted by his past. Something inside him refuses to remain dormant. It refuses to go away until he is dead. It is the Bat within his soul. tWM�s Rorshack fulfills this task. His entire identity lies in the murky chaos of his symbol that never maintains it�s form. He realizes the world is an ambiguity & struggles to form absolutes, reading the signs & portents while creating order in the world by ridding the world of rapists, murderes, and thieves. How? By the simple expedient of killing them. Bruce on the other hand never kills, but he certainly knows the best ways to harm people who do bad things.

In tWM, the heroes are forced into retirement by the Keene Act which renders vigilantism illegal. Inc has a far more mundane reason. In a copy of Harvey Dent�s suicide plunge from TDKR as he attempts to evade capture, Mr. Incredible catches a jumper and they crash through a plate-glass window. The jumper�s reason for attempting to end his life isn�t explained outside of his not-wanting-to-be-saved and he sues the pants of his rescuer.

Inc rapidly shoe-horned an annoying side-kick (an over-zealous fanboy stalking Mr. Incredible), Mr. I & Elastigirl flirting as they argue about who had captured a thief, a train-wreck caused by a Parisian bomber & the annoying side-kick�s interference, the police being baffled by Mr. I�s seeming too busy to help with capturing said Parisian, and Mr. I & Elastigirl marrying sans masks.

Chances are you�ve already seen the film. I personally felt it was too over-burned with TV cliches about family life (sitting at the dinner table & fighting only to stop everything when company came to visit; reading the newspaper, kid loudly complaining as they drove the family car, vacuuming, a father nauseatingly doting on his daughter because she decided to wear her hair a different way). For an �exceptional� family of superheroes, they sure were achingly dull even after the action had started. And where the hell did they get the stupid idea of the eccentric fashion designer making supersuits? Even as they were kicking things into what should have been high-gear, I found myself bored & restless for the entire thing to stop sucking.
Although it was somewhat amusing to see Dash punching a couple a thug at superspeed only to have the man completely unfazed at all because Dash�s tiny fists wouldn�t have bothered an ant.

Remember where America Started.

All these "Remember 9/11" bumper stickers I see are starting to seriously irk me. Why? Because it has become increasingly apparent to me that we as an American people are forgetting about 1776.

The United States of America wasn't always United. We originally were colonies. Some madman named George (back then he was the King of England) was unjustly taxing the colonists. The man was completely off his rocker. Now, it was traditional for a king to believe he'd been ordained by God to be king & thus his rule was backed by this perceived divine right. (Heck, King John was so crazy he even had his scribes re-write the Bible for goodness sake so that it accommodated his own conception of it.) But George was especially wacko. Finally, the colonists decided they were fed up with being bossed around by some guy who was lived all the way across the ocean. They wanted to rule themselves, so they revolted. At the end of the American Revolutionary War, the colonists got their wish.

Skip ahead.

Iraq is currently within the turmoil that the American colonies had been in. They are no longer enthralled by the dictatorship of Saddam Hussien. But the people they'd believed to be their liberators are beginning to more & more like a new regime trying to control them. Some madman named George (now he is George Walker Bush, "President" of the US) who lives on the other side of an ocean. His soldiers bring them something far worse than taxes: they bring death. Many sacred traditions that have been in place for centuries are being defiled by infidels. The American news media labels these people who are fighting for their homes "terrorists" & "insurgents" while the truest name for them would be "Revolutionaries."

In Summary: We haven't always been America: The World Superpower. We were once a country as steeped in turmoil & confusion as Iraq is now. And, heck, maybe comparing the Iraqis to the Native Americans would be more acceptable? They were called savages & were hated & despised by the settlers of America. The American people, rather than contenting themselves with staying to the East, decided to take away nearly the whole of the continent. So end result is "America" is the country in the lower part of the North American continent & is bordered by Mexico.

Look at a map of Europe. See how all those countries co-exist there? Several small countries snuggled together. Imagine if the people of America had stopped 30 or 25 & left the other half to the "Indians"? 


Fanatical Attitudes of the Right Wingers Clash with Fanatical Attitudes of the Muslim World. (Propaganda v.s. Propaganda. Hate v.s Hate.) 

I believe there was a Time magazine published sometime this year that had the cover story "Should Christians Convert Muslims?" The bias of course is meant to say that Christianity was more valid in some people's eyes than Muslim. And the goal of the Bush administration is to establish a democracy in Iraq to replace the old dictatorship.

I fail to see how America isn't also guilty of this one-vision perspective. This my-way-or-the-highway theory.

And what do you know about the people of Iraq? What you've read in American newspapers or other news-sources. Which is essentially as propaganda-istic as the media is the Middle East. I've read the articles as you have. How "insurgents" are daily blamed for most of the bloodshed going on over there. They are people defending their homes. Homes that have been decimated by American mortar fire. They are people whose places are worship is under attack.

If a foreign country actively invaded American soil, you seriously believe people would go belly-up & surrender like, well,... Poland during WW II? Absolutely not. They'd get mad, get angry, and probably go completely berserk. The Right-To-Carry-Arms advocates especially.


I believe I had heard that during the American Revolution, the colonists had resorted to guerrilla warfare to fight off the Red Coats. They hid behind cover and fired at their targets. The Red Coats' style of warfare was to orderly march onto a battlefield, have both sides stand face-to-face, then fire at each other until one side had sustained more casualties than the other. It was a practice of very well-established rules. More ceremonial than practical.

"Those people are savages because they're beheading people!"

Yah... and making a bunch of guys gang-bang each other or decorating some guy up like a Christmas tree with electrodes on his nuts is "kind."... 

The message is perfectly obvious: the US is not wanted in Iraq by those who live there. They're radicals who fight using guerrilla tactics who take shelter in the countries surrounding Iraq.

They haven't got the technology or the preparation or the capabilities of our troops. Why? Basically because they aren't as fortunate as we our when it comes to capital & resources. They use what means they have to combat us. They are willing to go to whatever extreme it takes to take back their own land.

Now these are simply my own opinions. I don't support the bloodshed; I'm just an observer as you are. I'm not significant enough to have my opinion respected. But I will still speak my mind. No matter who or how many disagree with me. My friend, THAT is what being an American is being about. (It's just not an American thing, I believe all people's voices should be heard on all matters.)

"Okay, bigshot! What would you do differently? HUH!?!? Cry to your mommy?"

The best tactic I can foresee for the US is to create a stronghold within Baghdad. Rebuild that city, do not chase anyone outside of that zone. Maintain a defensive front. Do our absolute best to show the Iraqi people we are serious about humanitarian resources. Make Baghdad into a safe-zone. Take care of the sick, feed the poor. Repair our reputation. PROVE to them we do not intend to be oppressors.

Running willy-nilly all over the country as if it were some stupid videogame or insipid action movie come life is definitely not the way to go.

Is There Altruism In The World?

Considering I�m not a self-promoter, I won�t regale you with my own virtues. Instead I�ll provide a running commentary where I analyze several pigheaded ninnyheads� disgusting lack of virtues.

My mother says: �I have an article dated in 1970 that says you can get AIDS from touching something without washing your hands.� Then: �In 1700, they published a paper that said you could get disesaes from germs.� �The article is actually from 1997. �You can get AIDS from saliva.� Uh� �Don�t touch me. I have enough problems without you touching me.� Okay� let�s see� she never cleans her house. It is always dirty. When I ask her if she wants me to clean it, she gets angry. �You should do something without asking first. JUST CLEAN IT AND SURPRISE ME!� So I let it stay dirty. Everytime I do things, she�ll watch me do it and will scream her lungs out about how I�m doing it WRONG! WRONG! WRONG! �The right way is�� And when she sees me doing something �wrong again�? She�ll scream again. The dog�s dirty. The furniture is dirty. The kitchen is dirty. Every surface in the house has dust or dirt on it. But she�s okay as long as she washes herself and does her laundry. And she�s very adamant about how she does things. She�s older, so she�ll always be right & I�ll always be wrong. God� does she realize she�s making herself sick?

I took a shower, washed every last germ off my skin with some body soap & loffa. And you know what? I nearly vomitted. I�m sitting here, sicker than a dog. It�s actually kinda fun. How long can I avoid puking my ever-lasting guts out all over my keyboard? Yep. Gonna be fun. �Sure, my clothes are clean, but I�m sicker than a dog. But, hey, I�ve got a strong constitution. Being a persecuted minority sure does give one great insight in this world of sinners we live in.

I haven�t had a cold or the flu. (A cold so bad that I can�t go anywhere and have to lie in bed & sneeze & cough & vomit. Um. No. �How do I do it? I take a shower to wash the grime off my body every morning. I wash my hair. Don�t brush my teeth. But I should use Listerine. The bacteria that collects in my mouth impairs my health. Being around smokers and breathing that junk in so that it gets stuck in my mouth & esophagus isn�t healthy. I put on some dirty clothes. They aren�t very, very, very dirty. Just aren�t exactly clean.

Think of the Incas & the Spaniards. Spanish explorers shanghaied homeless people off the streets to join their crew. Crud, every exploration was conducted the same way. The homeless people got to leave a life of poverty of being filthy on the streets to have the chance to travel to an unexplored continent. The �unwashed masses� the rich called the lower classes. 

The old ditty about monsters being drawn on maps or the-world-is-flat-and-if-you-sail-off-the-edge-of-the-world-you�ll-fall? Lies made up to discourage people from exploring. The cartographers & explorers didn�t want competition from just any old riff raff off the street. Three guys in a canoe might have been able to explore much of The Old World by themselves if they weren�t attacked by any jealous parties.

But anyway, the explorers themselves (the high echellon leading the operations) had frequent periods of illness in their voyage. Why? Impeccable bathing rituals. They were rich men of high renoun. They HAD to dress-to-impress. Wear fancy uniforms with swords. Fancy hats. And had to fight to rid themselves off all those nasty, despicable germs. GERMS! GERMS! GERMS! Only the wealthy bathed in Europe during the Age of Exploration. Only the wealthy were literate. It�s amazing how the middle-class of America has adopted Europen attitudes about hygeiene only the rich had. Did I mention the fact that the peasants (the people who had jobs who lived in the cities and not in the castle were dirty, too?). Hm. Then again, that was during the time of the plague. I�m pretty sure only the old would have died. The people whose job it was to clean the castle (the maids) probably had good hygeine. The important thing is that while the aristocrats were puking their ever-loving guts out on the ship & miserable with illnesses, the crew was blissfully filthy & dirty & their stomachs were fine & dandy. Impeccable hygeine makes you into a sissy.

Mt 6:25
Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?

EBD NTB TTT
Mt 6:26
Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?

Don�t worry about your clothes. Don�t worry about what you look like. Don�t worry about how tall you are or how fat you are or how old you are. Don�t worry about eating a healthy diet. Don�t worry about how expensive your clothes or your food is. A beggar is equal to any other person alive. And the answer to the question in MATTHEW 6:26? No, you aren�t. You�re not any better than any other animal in the world.

It�s amusing that in today�s society, people can read if they wish, but it is discouraged. It�s not cool to read. It�s cool to play sports, but reading?

[stupidity] Only a text book! Don�t know how to do something? Take a college course, buy the textbook, and squeak by.� Other books? Only a self-help book! Don�t forget the BIBLE, YOU HEATHEN SUCKHEAD PIECE OF SHIT! Only a newspaper! Only a magazine! Reading novels that you aren�t assigned in class is a waste-of-time! Only read what you are assigned by an Authority Figure! The Republican President Is Always Right! The Democrats Are Evil, Thieving, Adulterous Bastards! Don�t read a book or draw or do any faggotty creative stuff! Watch the GODDAMN EAGLES, DRINK A GODDAMN BEER, SMOKE A GODDAMN CIGARETTE, AND BE GODDAMN PATRIOTIC LIKE A REAL MAN!!!! [/stupidity] �That was fun, wasn�t it? A very accurate impersonation of a simpering Republican dope. It actually felt good to rant like that. L *sobs*

I get excitable at times, talk fast and loud. I express anger towards someone else I know & she gets mad at me because she thinks I�m yelling at her & ranting-and-raving. I am merely speaking strongly on the side of an opinion I have. It�s so very frustrating that nobody bothers interrupting me in mid-stream. They just can�t-get-a-word-in-edgewise because they aren�t trying to be assertive enough. INTERRUPT ME WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY. I won�t take offense. I�m not a preppie-fairy-queen-meterosexual-straight-and-narrow-sissy-boy. A person who loses their temper and speaks angrily when they don�t like another person�s tone isn�t strong. Such a person is a coward of the most comtemptible degree. A coward afraid of �seeming� weak. But this is a seemingness of weakness according to the brutalistic savage paternalistic society we live in today. People repress all human emotion except for anger, jealousy, and lust. They are taught these things are �virtues.� Interrupt me in mid-stream.

I�ll stop, listen to what you�re saying. If you say something I�d like to comment on, I�ll interrupt to interject that comment. I�m not talking just to hear myself talk. (I can do that in my car while I�m driving by myself.) I�m talking to give the person I�m talking to ample subjects to pounce upon. Don�t just sit there and be befuddled. A lot of the time, I�ll be listening to someone and they�ll say something I�d like to comment on. I�m not even directly involved in the discussion, but I�ll interrupt. Isn�t necessarry for a person to be speaking to me before I pipe up. Sure, it�s rude, but why insist upon politeness? Politeness is the cause of so much misery in the world.


Mt 5:28
But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.

�Just because I�m married (or have a girlfriend) doesn�t mean I�m not allowed to look,� says the lecher.

People get nervous when it comes to speaking with a member of the opposite sex. Heck, talking with girls is a lot easier than talking to guys. I can tell you that. A guy will interrupt me, shout at me, ignore what I am saying to him, in short be as hostile as he possibly can be. It�s sad that women in today�s society would rather whisper secretly into the ears of a man she trusts that she wants to have him tell off another man. She�ll tell all manner of lies she can think of to get the enforcer to bully the guy who is �being mean� to her. I�m not afraid of a guy shouting in my face. Just let him make a fool of himself. The people around him might feel he is justified in his arrogance. But.


Mt 5:25
Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.

Okay, so I wasn�t exactly doing that. I�m quick to challenge other people�s stupidity. I have a temper when it comes to people saying stupid things. I suppose everyone does. But I�m tolerant if someone makes a small miscalculation. If they�re clumsy or something, I won�t hold it against them. Everyone makes a mistake sometimes. No point hasseling a person because they make a small mistake in judgement or trip & fall or something.

Mt 5:39

And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.

�Hey, buddy, can I have a dollar?� asks the beggar. Sure, here�s two.

STOP HERE! Three pages done. Read the rest for fun. Put it down, please. Set it aside, grade a few boring papers, then read this one to amuse yourself when you�re feeling bored of that garbage.

Mt 5:42
Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.


Therefore insulting a person who asks to borrow from you is against the teachings of Jesus.

But if they try to make a judgement based upon statistics, I�m knocking that theory out of the freakin� ball park. �You�re a young man. You�re twenty six years old. You�re strong,� the Bahamian Bully Doctor with the lilting voice says to me. I�m not a racist. But I hate stupidity. You don�t know me well enough to make that judgement. Besides I don�t want to be strong. I want to be smart. �I�m talking statisically,� he shouts.


Why was I in the hospital? I�ve got high blood pressure. Just found that out recently. Had let a homeless friend sleep over at my apartment. He�s an okay-guy but he�s a walking ashtray. Not his fault. He hasn�t had a chance to wash his clothes effectively. Still got who knows how much cigarette ash wafting around in his clothing. During the night, I kept breathing in all that accumulated ash. Should have turned on the air conditioner. That wasn�t a very smart move. Er, I�ll continue that thought later.

Mt 5:22
But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.

What was Mr. Bahamian Bully Doctor mad at me? I was an unemployed, dirty, person with a Medicare card. I nearly passed out on the drive over to the hospital. I don�t have a job. He has a job. I came into his sterile enviroment dirty & stinky so he decided to unload on me. But being unemployed & dirty doesn�t make me a bad person. Instead of getting a job of my own� I don�t smoke, I don�t drink, I don�t do drugs. Statisics are for people too lazy to think for themselves.

[angry] WHAT THE FUCK? You�d think you could get a job by tip-tapping your Ruby Slippers & saying �I would like a job, please� with how easy people make it sound. Okay� I�m just making myself angry from thinking about it. [/angry] �[mellow]

Mt 5:11
Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
Mt 5:10
Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

[mellow] People who don�t uphold the �Beatitudes� yet claim to be Christian are basically fitting into the hypocrite category. Am I persecuted because of my joblessness? You betcha. [/mellow]

[angry]Honestly, how the fuck am I supposed to get a job if nobody hires me? �You haven�t worked in six years, why should we hire you?� Hey, douche bag! If nobody hires me, how am I supposed to get a job so future job interviewers will trust me?!?!?!?!?!?! HIRE ME! See how GREAT I am at the job, then shove your doubts up your whiney little arse!!! �Why did I quit my last job? Wait� I was fired from K-Mart because I was mentally ill. �Because I don�t take shit from anyone. I�m not a slave, I will speak my mind & stand up for myself as best as I am capable. (In the past I couldn�t. I just kept my frustration inside, lost my temper occassionally, then quit because I was concerned if I kept the job I�d kill myself.) [/angry]

[mellow] I drive when there�s rain or snow flurries coming down. I drive slowly, keep up a good pace, and put the car in over-drive. (I guess I didn�t help my suspension by wieghing my car down a lot, but hey, I�m a packrat. I don�t feel safe if I can�t trust whether or not my stuff is in okay shape. I noticed when I was driving with a lot of wieght in the back, I swerved in snow. But now that I�ve lightened the load considerably, the car�s working fine.)

Sure, that would have caused an accident, but I can drive. I don�t drink, but I can drive no matter how drowsy I�m feeling. Sure, I might miss a turn and have to turn back. But I�ve got some brain-power. I walked very slowly, bent completely over into the ER. I was unsteady on my feet. You see how well a person walks when they�ve got their blood pressure in the stratosphere & they�re crashing.

Was I panicky? Hey, I sat down on a toilet that had cleaning powder on it & I thought I�d sat in someone�s cocaine they�d snorted off the bowl. I didn�t know what it was, I was riding high on paranoia. �Did I like it? No. Did I realize I was �high�? Never been that way before. I figured out a lot of my health problems were caused by wearing a belt that was too tight. I measured my waist then the belt and the belt was 5.5� smaller than my waist.

�You can�t make diagnosises because you�re not a doctor.� Correction: I can as long as I make diagnoses regarding my own personal health. And if I pass on my deductions to another person, I�m not asking to be paid for them. �I could have a heart murmur, but a doctor never stopped to listen to my heart-beat. They just check the blood pressure, then have me breathe so they can check my lungs. But in order to listen to one�s heart, you have to have them hold their breath & listen to the heart beat by itself. Atleast I�m pretty sure that�s how it works. Wouldn�t the sound of the breath cover up any abnormal beats? You gotta listen for a few minutes to make sure you can hear everything properly.

I drove him in my car, he�d smoked. I guess I�ve figured out what happens to a person when they smoke (or get a goodly lungful of second-hand smoke when in close proximity to a smoker). I went to Walmart, checked my blood pressure. I had a whopping 151 systostic/ 75 diostic / 103 pulse. My heart was racing. Guess you could call that a �high.� Then roughly four hours later, maybe six, I�m completely drained. I don�t have the strength to sit or stand. I was complaining that I might pass out, but some mean women was torturing me by insisting I had to continue to play a game of Sorry! even though I couldn�t concentrate on the game.

Why? I was crashing, had reached a moment of collapse. I don�t smoke. My father smoked. Hated it. Since I have been wearing a belt for four years that was too tight around my waist, it cut off whatever arteries are along the waist. I�ll look those up� http://www.innerbody.com/image/cardov.html and http://www.innerbody.com/image/nervov.html .

Okay... so compressing those arteries and nerve endings impaired my memory, ability to see at night (especially bad when driving), concentration, confidence, and my legs didn�t have proper blood circulation. Couldn�t do simple math. Generally I was functioning at 60% mental capacity. Hehe. I wonder how much higher my IQ was than the average person when I WASN�T working at peak performance? �But, um, I was immune to cigarette smoke. Couldn�t breathe, couldn�t smell the nasty stench of my own clothing, but I kept my hands and face and hair clean. The parts under the dirty clothes? Doing okay. Maybe a little soiled. ��I had to rest my elbows on my stomach because I couldn�t hold up my own arms. Vision was getting blurry. Went past Macy�s exit of the mall. Crap! Turned around in a parking lot for some doctor�s office. Drove down Business Route 1. Almost went in the wrong lot. What do you expect from someone on the verge of collapse? I didn�t get in an accident, went completely limp the whole time I was in the Frankford Hospital�s ER & waiting room. Did I get any sympathy? No. Just comtempt.

�It�s snowing out,� says Mr. Square. �You better drive to your mother�s house because it�s closer.� I responded, It�s okay as long as it doesn�t freeze. It�s just powder. I can drive through it as far as Bristol. I was planning on driving to Bailey�s for Karaoke that night anyhow. (Weds.) Mr. Square looks dubious. He watches as I scratch his dog�s ears, side, rub its ears, basically working-my-magic. The dog�s digging it. The dog is lying there with its belly up, putty in my hands. I�m good with dogs. Show affection to a dog, work it up into a frenzy of ecstacy. Then when you get bored, leave it alone. The dog�ll sit around moping & miserable that its being ignored as you watch TV. Jealousy that its �friend-who-can-scratch-it-in-that-ticklish-place-near-its-breast-bone-so that its leg spasms (hm� I always thought dogs especially liked this part)

OH. They called a janitor to wash every surface I�d sat or leaned on. Those cards I�d handed the receptionist? She probably washed her hands but good. I guess I figured out what it�s like to get high & go through withdrawl. It was a miserable feeling. I was weaker than I�ve ever felt in my life. Thought I was dying. I wasn�t feeling depressed or nothing. Just annoyed. My abdominal muscles weren�t working. I had no strength in my neck to keep my head up. Staggered around. And all they say was a dirty, filthy bum with no job spreading GERMS! GERMS! GERMS! �While I was there, they had some nurse come in adjust the bed so she could get a fire extinquisher. Or some kind of oxygen tank. Did they need that specific tank? No. It was to test if I was serious. I couldn�t raise myself up using my abdominal muscles. Couldn�t do a sit up if my life depended on it. So I used my left arm to pull on the bar.

I wasn�t a human being to them. These people don�t care about human beings. They care about what�s in your wallet, how expensive your clothes look, and whether or not you have more or less money than they�ve got. I was a lowlife, scum. A figure of comtempt. Of ridicule. A nuissance. A whiney, depressed sack of shit. *laughing* I think I�ll call up my lawyer friends and have a nice, little talk with them. Medical Malpractice case? Yes. Discrimination? Yes! I may be poor myself, but I have relatives who work in the insurance racket. Relatives who very well must have lawyer colleagues. I am angry. I am pissed off. When I think of all the friends I have who are poor, disabled, & have been fooled by an insane world into believing they are �mentally ill�� It burns me with an anger of righteous indignation. I have friends in high places, I have exceptional networking skills. And I am very, very, very interested in giving a legal arse-kicking to a few hospitals I know of. Honestly, the people in the staff aren�t people. They�re breathing robots.

[Unneccessary theological theorizing]

Christianity started out on the Down-Low. Christians are basically The Jews Version 2.0. Before Christians, there were The Jews who followed the Old Testament. The Jews were persecuted minorities. Jesus was a poor jew who got tired of his people being persecuted and stood up to give his people advice about how to live their lives.

What he performed were �miracles� because they were beyond the comprehension of the average person. He could give someone mouth-to-mouth & anyone watching would claim he�d magically resurrected that person. He was a healer who understood how the body worked. The people murdered in Salem during the Witch Hunt were healers like Jesus. The average person in Europe went to the barber to have surgery done. He�d cut �em up, bandage the person, and that person living or dying was all based on luck. It�s funny how people don�t believe in magic. They believe Jesus performed Miracles�. which were basically magic. Weren�t they? Ghosts exist? Why not? Aliens? Why not? I would never think to discourage a person from having an imagination.

Was he crucified? Yes. Did he rise from the cross? Probably not. Someone who looked like him probably started claiming he was Jesus arisen from the cross. The world�s first copycat. Anyway, it�s unfortunate. Instead of following the example set by Jesus (the guy being persecuted), people follow the example of the Romans & the Egyptians before that (the guys who persecute).

Tighten Our Belts.

Finding virtue in being "less perfect." 
Survival techniques learned by an expert dork.

Now first take a few moments to think of some people in the world who are successful who don't have "proper posture." Stephen King, Bill Gates, Peter Jackson, Tom Hanks. Just about every intelligent person I can think of has one thing in common: they walk stoop-shouldered. Another one is Albert Einstein. Sigmund Freud. Donald Trump. These aren't good-looking people, but aye carumba are they smart! 

Think of Shaggy from Scooby Doo. Think of Gyro Gearloose on Ducktales. Think of Beavis & Butt-head. Our culture is structured around depicting people who haven't got "proper posture" as being stupid or cowardly. It's not good to be smart. It's good to fit-in. But obviously the real people I've listed in the above paragraph are successful, intelligent people. And what about Stephen Hawking? He's the smartest man alive & he has a paralyzing illness. Whatever doesn't go to his extremities must be traveling to his brain at super-speeds. 

STEP ONE: 
I thought we�d start with a simple relaxation technique. Now, I�d like you all to relax your muscles.

The simplest way to do this is to stop concentrating on sitting-up-straight or standing-up-straight. Relax your necks so that your heads move out of the position you�ve been taught to be �poor-posture.� Let all the stiffness out of your spines. The human body isn't supposed to be completely erect all the time. 

Now I�m sure you�ve all had complaints in your lives about headaches, muscle pain, your joints hurting. You feel stressed out� I believe all these things are caused by maintaing an unnaturally rigid posture. Your bodies aren�t meant to be rigid. If you constantly stand & sit like that, your muscles never have a chance to relax. You�ve got muscles all over your bodies, they are all inter-connected.

I�m not sure if you�ve paid attention to what happens with a person�s body when they smoke a cigarette. I�m not advocating smoking, but rather examining the technique.

The person holds their hand like so, they have the cigarette pointed towards themself. The head comes forward, they light the cigarette. When the person smokes, they inhale. As they inhale & exhale to breathe the smoke deeply into their lungs, their muscles relax. It isn�t the smoke that causes the relaxation. [b]It�s the technique.[/b] The muscles become relaxed for a few moments that it takes to puff on a cigarette. The deep breath also helps.

Okay, so I want everyone to hold their hands in front of their faces and take a deep breath. And for this whole day, don�t even think about �proper posture.� Think of maintaining a relaxed, at-ease position. Yawn frequently. Sigh. Take cleansing breaths. When you're itchy, scratch. 

It is in this position that you will discover you will become incredibly better at everything. I�m not kidding here. Okay, so maybe my memory isn�t very good. I guess if I stood more straight I�d be able to get verbal directions people give me better. But when it comes to nearly everything else, I�m solid.

STEP TWO: 
Okay, now here�s another technique. I�m sure you�ve heard the expression �tighten your belt�? When you eat at Thanksgiving, I�m sure you�ve heard of people who loosen their belts as they ate so they could eat more food. Letting their bellies go loose, after eating, they feel such a profound moment of ease & content. They feel happy. It�s the belt. Let me tell you, for five years of my life, I wore a belt that was too small. I knew it was, but I felt so empty inside my head that I could never quite make the thought �I have to buy a new belt� loud enough so that it seemed like a priority. I constantly said �I�m going to do this, I�m going to do that� and had completely forgotten my plans.
I�m asked �how was my week so far� and I was completely at-a-loss for what had happened the day before. You probably noticed I didn�t smell very good. I didn�t know. I couldn�t smell anything. My nose wasn�t working.

I couldn�t do simple math in my head. Nobody believed me. �You�re so smart, you must be lying to me when you say you can�t do math. You�re making excuses for not being more responcible with your money.�

I had lower back pain, headaches, felt nearly dizzy all the time. My blood circulation was very poor. I know I complained once about sitting around so that my legs fell asleep & I couldn�t walk. I was irritable because of my bad health because nobody believed me when I said I had things wrong with my health. �There�s nothing wrong with you.� I thought I had schizophrenia or schizoaffective or some days I thought I was bipolar. I wanted to know what exactly was wrong with me and was going to figure it out for myself. And it turns out� it was that stupid belt.

I bought a new belt along with some clothes for a job interview. I was wearing that new belt & those new clothes, walking around. I finally had something around my waist that was loose. But why was it important to me to wear a tight belt? I didn�t want some idiot to walk up behind me & pants me.� It was a survival technique that dorks learn.

When you walk, keep an eye on where your feet go. I personally never trusted my feet. I used to have a left-ankle that would turn-in. I tripped over my own left-foot during a square-dance in gym class when I was 13. Ever since them, I always made a point of being suspicious of that foot. And, besides, the easiest way to get tripped by a bully is to walk without paying attention to your feet.

Now let me tell you about how I learned this relaxation techique I told you about earlier. By playing videogames. I would sit in a chair for hours a day leaning forward in my chair with my elbows on my knees. This was how I got into �the zone.�

I had complete concentration on the television screen, could see everything that was going on. Every situation that Super Mario or Sonic the Hedgehog found himself in, I could figure out a way to get to the next stage. I acted with confidence, with precision, my reflexes were increased.

Now, the other kids when they heard I played videogames teased me. They asked �are you going to marry your Nintendo?� I honestly didn�t understand the logic behind this. I knew I was being teased, but I never figured out what the rationale behind the tease was. I wasn�t dating. I wasn�t pressured to date anyone� heck, I was trained to believe I wasn�t like other people. I was inferior. I wasn�t good at sports, I was too emotional. I wanted to be nice to people & have them be nice to me. That didn�t get me anywhere. But hey, you know why they teased me? Because I read better than they could, because they probably tried to play videogames but weren�t good at them. Why? Because they were using the wrong posture.

�Nice guys finish last� and certainly I was finishing last in comparisson to the other crowd. But this isn�t a sad story. It isn�t �bad� for me to talk about it. I learned that the only person in this world who really had to like me was me. I could live happilly persuing my hobbies.

So I made friends with books. I would think of reading a novel as having a long conversation with a friend. In this way, John Stienbeck, Stephen King, J.R.R. Tolkien, Dean Koontz, and many many more were very good friends of mine. I�d never met them in person. Never got any of their autographs. But I read the stories they had written & wanted to write my own.

Concentrate on my own happiness. I�m not bragging. I�ve lived a life as filled with misery & torment as the next person. But the important thing is that I chose not to be around people who caused me to feel unhappy. The ones who did just weren�t worth acknowledging. So I spent most of my life learning things, figuring stuff out. I know many of you might say I�m �an intellectual.� Please stop.

I�m not better than anyone else in the world. My station in life is very low. I�m that person who people would rather dislike. I�m an individual, but being an individual doesn�t make me feel happy. I�m standing up here and all I see in myself is that pathetic loser nobody ever liked. A worthless nobody. � Now you see? Those are things said by average people to lessen my ability to compete with them. They can�t stand seeing me be better at things they falter at. But honestly, why should anyone�s goal be to be average? Being average doesn�t make a person better. Being part of the group doesn�t. Honestly, it limits the individual�s ability to live up to their own potential. It disables every member of the group from diverting from the group into their own path.

The world would be a happier place if every person was capable of expressing themselves without feeling a whole wieght of comtempt & hatred tossed upon them by the under-achievers. I don�t speak confidently to lessen another person�s belief in their own person. I speak this way in hopes they�d start believing in themselves, too. When you have to, use the proper posture. For job interviews or something. But keeping in this position all day & all night is KILLING YOU!

Okay, so try it out. Don't wear clothes that are too tight around your waist & always keep your posture relaxed. You'll be less angry. Don't feel compelled to think what everyone else in the world is thinking. Think for yourself. Be proud of your "dorky" hobbies because dorks are the kings of the universe right now. 

So... try these techniques or don't. I'm not asking for any money. Just trying to help each of your lives be far less stressful.






















My Twin is��
a Darkling?�
�by�
Mara The Sorrowful


























Prologue: Kyle the Eunuch.
A digital alarm clock roars to life with the sound of a rockband
playing loud music. The room is a mess, posters on the walls,
clothes and varous debris all over the floor. Something stirs
in the bed beneath the covers.
�Dammit, shut up!� says the thing as it emerges from the
covers and swats at a button on the top of the alarm clock. A
teenage boy has awakened in the chaos of the morning.
�Tyler!� shouts a woman from beyond a bedroom wall. �You
woke your father up again! He isn�t happy.� There is noise
from the other side of the wall. �You know he doesn�t have to
go to work until a half hour after you have that alarm clock of
yours set!�
�CHANGE THE DAMN TIME ON YOURS!� roars another voice.
This would be dad. Tyler hopes they aren�t fighting in there
but there�s nothing he can do.
�Sorry!� yells Tyler.
�I�ll make you sorry, boy!� answers his father. �I was just
trying to get back to sleep.�
3
Tyler isn�t sure he should apologize again. He elects not to.
There�s a slight tapping on his bedroom door. Tyler crawls out
of bed and opens the door.
There stands his mother. She looks haggard. �I asked you to
clean your room, remember?� she whispers. �It�s Saturday.�
Tyler doesn�t answer at first. �Can you help me? It�s kinda
overwhelming.�
�So is being married to your father,� his mom says. Despite
how tired she is, she smiles.
�So then what happened?� asks a girl.
Flash forward to Tyler sitting in a pickup truck with his
girlfriend. He has his arm around her shoulders. �We cleaned
my room, so what?�
�That�s a happy memory of your mother? C�mon!� She looks at
Tyler with disappointment.
�What? We waited til dad got to work and then we cleaned my
room. It was nice. She usually just told me to clean my room
but she never actually helped me do it before.�
4
�But your dad was probably hitting her or pushing her around
in the other bedroom before that!�
Tyler didn�t get it. �So what?� He shrugged.
�Don�t �so what?� me, Tyler! As if that is acceptable behavior
for a man to behave.�
�My dad wasn�t acceptable, Shirley,� Tyler says.
Shirley pushes at him and makes some distance between the
two of them.
Tyler doesn�t force her back into his embrace. He�s learned
that when she does that, she wants the space and that
wrestling with her won�t get her in a better mood. He also
knows that trying to make her laugh by tickling her doesn�t
work either. She doesn�t like that. �Well the point is they are
getting divorced, isn�t it?�
�You should have kicked his ass!� Shirley says. �Be a man!�
�Why don�t you be the man in my story instead, huh? I had no
other place to go. Your dad wouldn�t of let me in your house
AND I didn�t know you then anyway!�
Shirley twirls a piece of her hair in her fingers. �I guess you�re
right.�
6
put her hands on her temples.
Tyler laughs. �I�m the mess. At least I was when I lived with
my parents in their house.�
Shirley manages a giggle or two. �You�re still a mess in that
sense!�
Tyler is eighteen now. That time he was talking about earlier
had been two years ago. The days following he would call
�Dad�s Nuclear Period� and this was the closest he had come
to telling anyone about that time. Not even at his parents�
divorce hearings had he spoken of such things. His girlfriend,
Shirley, is two years his senior.
On her twenty-first birthday she�d gone to a drinking party
where a young man she barely knew, the aforementioned
Dylan, had gotten his mitts on her and knocked her up. It was
young Tyler who came to her rescue after they�d met at a
support group for family members of alcoholics.
�I�m Tyler and my dad went nuclear on me and my mom so I�m
here,� he had said from his chair in the auditorium when it
was his turn to speak. He was asked to elaborate by the cute
redhead sitting next to him. (This would have been Shirley.)
�Well, you know. He got madder than I�d ever seen him and
just LEFT. Like afterward I could swear there was a
mushroom cloud over the house and me & mom were left
7
living in the fall out.�
�Did your dad hurt you or your mom?� asked the brunette
across the room who was slightly prettier looking. Tyler
grunted. She�d lost a few points with that question.
�Can I take a pass on the question? It�s still too raw for me to
talk about,� Tyler said.
�Life isn�t a game, you know!� pouted the brunette.
�We�re sitting here taking turns talking. We have to follow the
rules, right?�
�So?� said the ugly chick. She really lost quite a few points by
now.
�So I can pass if I want,� said Tyler. �Or I can take a shot for
greatness.�
�So what�s stopping you?� said the troll girl.
�LINDSAY!� said Shirley. �We didn�t goad you this much when
you first showed up here.�
Troll girl shut up. She had to make a huffing noise first, but
did it.
10
thursday, "Jane the Hooker" (as most of knew her) was
murdered."
There were a few gasps. Mark got angry. "Are you talking
tonight or the badge?"
"Both of us are talking, Mark." He grimaced. He glanced at
the facilitator.
David was the guy's name. David was facilitating tonight.
"Please, it is Sam's turn, Mark. No cross-talk."
Mark muttered something about shoving that badge up
Sam's ass.
"Sam, please don't take more than one turn. If you know how
I mean," said David.
"I"m not here to be personal, David." Sam caught himself
from mentioning a fig leaf. This wasn't the same David. It
was just a guy with the same name. Mark raised his hand.
Sam pointed at him.
David acknoweledged Mark. "You can interject for a couple
minutes, but keep in mind it it is Sam's turn."
11
Mark stood this time. "I hate it when the cop comes. It ruins
the meetings!" A couple people nodded ascent. "I leave here
paranoid for a couple days afteward each time."
Sam raised an eyebrow at Mark. Mark sat down again. Sam
stood again and this time he was holding a poloraid up along
with his small notebook. He handed the poloraid to David.
David glanced at it and passeed it to the person next to him.
David
said, "Pass it around, everyone look at it." He looked up at
Sam. "Any other photos?"
"Not this time, David." He cleared his throat. "The suspects
are three detectives under my command who are under
suspension."
Mark was getting out of his chair and putting his coat on.
Mark didn't like the cold.
As he made his way out, Sam watched Mark walk to the
coffee machine to fetch himself a cup.
Sam glanced at his notes for another minute. No one else
stood. David was making a go-on gesture. "They also beat
down "Stinky Silvio"... caved his skull in." It was true that
Jannels was also a member of the group. Sam in fact was
Jannel's sponsor.






One of the women, Janet, pipes up "This is why I don't want cops to be in these meetings!"

“I don't know, Janet. I for one like the transparency of the meetings,” David
 said as he counted signatures on the sheet. “We hardly ever have the experience of seeing the Boys in Blue giving us the Straight Shit.”

Sam said his thanks and left.

As he walked out he, he noticed that the two youngsters had started to make out in the back of the room. Well, Sam thought, you can't make the young kids pay attention to the older crowd if they didn't want to be.

David did make a little joke about it. Sam wasn't sure what the man said but he was sure the kids hadn't heard him either. Sam made a gesture, pointing his index finger down at empty space. It meant “let's keep this on the down low.” David winked. Message received.

David flicked the lights five times quickly on and off to announce the end of the meeting. The love birds had disengaged by the second blink and were out the door on the fourth.






Chapter 2


THERE WAS SOMETHING OUT THERE IN THE DARKNESS.
Something hungry. KeeLow didn’t believe HomeBrew. He said HomeBrew was illin’. Now KeeLow was dead. HomeBrew lay in a corner of the pickup’s bed parked in the alley. He did his best to remain motionless with KeeLow’s sagging dead weight on top of him like a blanket. He hoped whatever was out there would think he was dead, too.

HomeBrew’s real name was Bernard. He’d gotten his name because he drank only homemade coffee from a thermos he’d had since he was a child. He ate mostly chocolate ice cream & chocolate yogurt. HomeBrew was at the best of times a twitchy, nervous man. But this wasn’t the best of times. He was… well, how did he wind up here? He had no idea who the heck’s truck this was. Wasn’t even quite sure what color it was because it so dark. All he knew for sure was the was scared. And he had to move his bowels.  

- Written as a cliff-hanger circa 2009.


Bernard's Day Before.

Goddamn, this one's gonna wreck me, Bernard was thinking. He got up out of the couch slopilly, nearly falling down. He had to be careful. KeeLow tossed the second controller at the back Bernard's head which it bounced off of.

“Wiggle your black ass back here! I'm not letting you take a dive! I let your cheap ass play Johnny Cage all these frickin' years! Cheap ass bitch!” KeeLow yelled.

“Just snort some cocaine or something, dude,” said Bernard, wiggling a little bit faster.

“You must be kidding a brother!” screamed Kee-Low as he got off the couch as well.

From the kitchen stormed a large woman in an apron. “Kevin Lovenski! I told you not to get excited when your friends come over to play that stupid crap!”

Something in Bernard's stomach exploded. “Oh no!”

“Goddamit, Bernard! I told you if you do that often enough I'd put your black ass in diapers!!!”

She ran into the kitchen and came out with trash bag. “Lord have mercy,” she prayed to herself, “two grown men without jobs playing that Blasphemy!' She put the trash bag on the couch for Bernard to sit on.

“Oh come on, mom. It's Sega Genesis...” Kee-Low complained.  

- Yet another cliff-hanger, but this written circa 2016.


The Personal Ad

Bernard's Salvation came two weeks earlier when he just happened to reading in a classified section of a news paper some rather unorthodox personal ad.

It read:  “20s M looking for (NONgay) 20s M or F. Goal: Kick it old school. I can't afford a modern gaming console & need someone to chill wid.”

Bernard was amused. That was how he met Kee-Low. Despite the name Kee-Low was and wasn't a dealer. He just didn't have a knack for selling. And he smelled of various chemicals. When Bernard came over to the house the first time, Kee-Low had a blanket sheet on his coffee table.

There was also a half-naked girl who also visited. She was upset Kee-Low wasn't a rapper and also that he didn't share his stash. But the girl shared much of herself in ways that were a bit too liberal for the 29 year old Bernard.

But this was before The Big Reveal. Kee-Low let Bernard into the house and after Bernard had removed his shoes, Kee-Low swiped the sheet from the coffee table, revealing a battered old console. “Behold! The Sega Mega Drive & Madden 1994, fools!” For some reason the “Mega Drive” was painted white and  the logo on the front had been obscured by a handmade sign saying “Mdrive” on it.

“Is this a joke,” the girl wanted to know. “We playing just a Genesis & one game? And a sports game at that made the year I was born?”

Kee-Low's mom had walked into the room at that exact moment burdened with a plate of cookies. At the hearing of the dreaded G-word the old woman dropped the plate and fell to her knees to pray. Which wound up being a twenty minute argument between her and her son whose name turned out to really be “Kevin.” She demanded her son renounce Judaism and fretted where to find a sufficent substitute of holy water in her home.

She also banished her two house guests to her son's bedroom. Bored and maybe a laughing a little too much at the spectacle, the girl brought Bernard's salvation to him. All it cost him was a few spankings in the middle of the excitement. Her name turned out to be Francine.

Francine brought Bernard him his damnation as well, but that is a different story.

To be continued again.



Chapter 3

Book of the Crow:
Dove & Crow Saga Continued
by Michael Woodard



Scene One.

(BLACK SCREEN)
(Action as described by
Voice Over when there is VO.)

(VO) “The grass dances in the warm breeze in celebration, back lit by the waning light of an evening sun.”

(Fade into scene, close up of blood dripping on a few tufts of grass. The grass is being aggressively blown around in the wind. The sun is near setting.)

(VO) “Today is special.”

(Camera zooms out to show a dying dove (CGI or animated) with a crow pecking at the corpse.)

(VO) “After a long drought, the thirst is finally quenched with the blood of a dove.”)

Two young boys walk at dusk.

One is dressed in black with a black cape. His name is Raven.

The other boy is dressed in white with a rainbow cape of many colors. His name is Bleach.

Raven raises a hand to the air and points at something in the distance as it happens.

Equally sharp-eyed, Bleach sees it as well.



High above them in the sky an eagle is flying.

A smaller bird, a dove, flies too near and the eagle shrieks before striking at the dove and knocking it down to fall to the earth below.

“Reminds me of you,” says the boy in black. He takes a quick jump and begins to hover along the ground at great speed.



A lone crow picks at the dying dove. It stands on the dove's broken wing, pinning it down with its crude, reptilian feet.

The crow openly rejoices at the dove's misery, it had arrived to the carnage first and it had even beaten the flies that would have invaded such a prize.

The crow swallows a morsel, smiling in its own way to the dove's shrieks of pain. "Thought you could soar with eagles, did you?" cajoles the crow. "Apparently old Thoragil didn't agree, eh?"

The dove convulses and chirps curses at the crow, blood welling from its severed wing. The crow steps aside, croaking, "Fly, stupid Dove. Fly away. To your worms and play that you so love."

The dove stands on its rickety feet and makes a last, feeble attempt to regain flight. The dove chirps one final time then dies.

The crow saunters over, cawing in its crow-laughter as it pecks out an eye and swallows it whole.

SCENE TWO.

Two men watch the scene. One is fat, white, balding, and slouched over. He drools on himself as he pokes a cigarette in his mouth. The bald man is gross, a collection of sweat, stained clothing, and general sloth. His name is KEVIN.

The other is tall, African American, and skinny. He is wearing a suit, dressed impeccably. He stands up straight and narrow. His name is PAUL.
Paul has one hand on Kevin's left shoulder.

The two men stare at what can be termed a hologram. The room is gloomy around them, insubstantial.

Paul is chanting softly and slowly to himself:  “I am Paul, me and my friend see what we wish. We see with second sight what we wish to see, a sight beyond normal sight.” It is a mouthful, but he intones each word slowly as this helps him concentrate. After a pause, he repeats the chant.

Around both men's necks are pieces of stone which appear to be quartz on necklaces. Paul's has a silver chain while Kevin's is a length of twine. Both stones redly in the gloom.

At the sight of the boys entering the scene, Kevin begins to act bored and rummages through his pockets for a cigar and a match.

KEVIN: “How the fuck did you get it to talk like that, Paul? Narrate like that?”
Kevin lights his cigar, spits.

Paul is visibly angry with him. His face tenses and he slaps his hand on Kevin's shoulder. He is in mid-chant. “WE SEE WITH A SECOND SIGHT!” he shouts this part out before going back into the soft chant.

A woman's voice (Kevin's Wife): “Shut up, Kevin! This is amazing you drunken fool!”

A man's voice (Kevin's son): “Paul, keep it up! We're having great progress.”

At the sight of the eye being removed, Kevin shudders. He blows smoke into Paul's face.

Paul growls with anger this time.

In the hologram, the Raven suddenly stops. The scene freezes. He looks over his shoulder and smiles at the men. He faces them (looking into camera).

RAVEN: “I see two of my enemies watching my past.” His voice is that of an adult.

Raven's eyes turn feline and the irises glow red. His tongue comes out and it stretches a foot in length, tasting the air. The smokey aura around the hologram glows red instead of gray. It disappears. From the center where the hologram was a burst of blood splatters and the men's faces are suddenly covered in blood.

Demonic laughter. The room around the two men becomes completely dark. We can only see their faces by the light of Kevin's cigar.

Paul is furious. He shoves Kevin back a pace and slaps him very hard.
Paul: “Goddamn you, Mr. Foreman of MY railroad, you made a mistake!”

Kevin: “Goddamn yourself, NI---” he stops himself mid-slur.

Paul: “Knee?” His face looks like it is about  to explode. “Are you calling me a KNEE or something, else, Draquil?'

Paul raises a fist and holds his arm cocked, ready to slug Kevin should he say the wrong thing.

KEVIN: “Nightbird.”
Kevin grimaces, tossing the cigar down to the floor.

(Camera follows the cigar in close-up as it falls down.)

Paul composes himself. “I am Paul and I am calm.”


SCENE THREE.

From the embers of the falling cigar, we see a closeup of another fire. This fire is inside a coffin wherein a sleeping vampire boy has come awake.)

In this scene Raven is wakened from his sleep by light. He realizes his coffin is on fire and he is about  to be burned up. He says a word in a strange language. His clothing and body become fireproof.

He then says “kaboom!” and the coffin around him explodes, sending burning pieces arcing into the air.

He flies out at breakneck speed til he is safe above the conflagaration.

Adult Raven, VO (laughing evilly): “If I could of chosen a day to have been my birth, I would claim this day to be it. For it was this day I was unleashed into the world without a safe haven to call home any longer.”

Adult Raven, VO: “No rest for the wicked it seems...”

The flying boy looks around, beginning to laugh and at the same time curses.

Young Raven: “I fear for the life of whoever attacks the predator in its slumber!”

A wolf howls at a distance. Young Raven spies it, punching his fist in the direction of the wolf in anger. A line of fire spits from his hand and travels a quarter of the distance from him towards the direction of the wolf but sputters out.

Young Raven laughs. The wolf whimpers and runs away. Young Raven swoops towards the running wolf and strikes it with a burning fist. The carnage is over quickly.

Young Raven: “I am your new alpha!”
He howls just like an actual wolf.


Close up on his smiling face. Zoom into his forehead.


SCENE FOUR.

Adult Raven, VO: “But truth be told, I had a proper birth like anyone else.”

A naked, pregnant, green woman with long green hair writhes in a golden room.

Adult Raven, VO: “She has twenty nurse maids at her call and a whole slew of her animal friends from the forest watching her (two of each species) but she not once asked for help.”

Adult Raven, VO: “Esteem was her name. The Goddess of Harvest.”

One of the nurse maids exclaims and grabs at Esteem's right leg. “Grab the other one! I think the child is to be born!” Another old woman grabs the left as ordered.

The birds begin to sing as the baby's head starts crowning.

A baby boy is born. This one has grayish skin and a mop of black hair. The baby hisses like a snake. It is Raven. The birds lose their song disjointedly.

A moment later, a pale, white-haired, white skinned baby is born. The birds begin their song again. The baby cries. He is normal, despite his complexion. It is Baby Bleach.

Snarling, Raven baby grabs his younger brother's throat. His brother embraces him.

Esteem: “Grandfather, what  is happening?”

In the back of the room, a shriveled old gnome with glasses is wakened from his snoring slumber by the urgency in the green woman's voice. He sees what is happening.

Grampah: “The older child is evil! He is trying to kill his brother!”
He leaps from the wooden  chair he was sitting in aggresively moves towards the two babies.

Esteem: “Do not kill him! Save both children!”
She bends over and separates the two fighting children. Baby Bleach isn't breathing. “Save my son!”

Grampah: “It is too late! He is dead...”

Esteem: “Do not tell me this, bring him from back from the dead!”

Grampah: “But... .but...”

Esteem: “Do It! Do it now!”

Grampah places one hand on the boy's head and the other on the boy's chest. He mutters in a strange language. “I will you to live, small one.” He frowns. “As I was telling you, the spark of life is barely in this one. He has just come into the world and his soul had just as swiftly been distinguished.”

Baby Raven laughs. It is an evil sound. The wolves howl in dismay.

Baby Bleach begins to cry again and breathe. If at all possible, he has gotten paler.

Grampah: “It is done. You have birthed a daywalker... a hollow and undead child. A child with no soul. I hope you are happy with your decision.”

Esteem shushes him. She holds the babies to opposite breasts and begins to sing. Hesitantly, the birds begin to sing along with her. Bleach is suckling immediately. Raven refuses nourishment.

Grampah sighs.

Baby Raven bites at the breast with a mouthful of sharp teeth. Esteem grimaces in pain, but the baby begins to nurse on something he finds tasty: her bloody milk.

Grampah, VO: “From that day, I knew them to be different. As different from night and day. So I decided to hex the birth to prevent the boys from being at each other's throats most of the time. One shall sleep while the other awakens... but the boys may play only at an Equinox...”


SCENE FIVE:

The Crime Scene Has Been Tainted. Revised.

“So, you’re saying he what? He was gray? He had gills?
Fuck, that’s hard for me to understand. Was he wearing a scuba mask? I don’t see a fucking fishing boat here. This is your apartment, miss, I don’t see anything here that reminds me of a damn shark. I heard that alligators are in the sewers? Did one climb out and bite you on the ass? Did a shark bite you? Looks like you’ve got all your arms and legs.”

“No, listen. I said, ‘it was like Jaws.’ Not in the sense that it was anything like a shark. The guy had nothing to do with a damn shark.”

“You weren’t even swimming, either. You got a shower back there, but no bath tub. And you’ve got a nice assortment of rubber ducks back there. Oh, I’m sorry, not rubber ducks, but rubber dicks.”

“Jealous because you only have the one? Rubber dick I mean. Why don’t you take it out of your ass and shove it in your mouth so you can shut up for a fucking minute?”

Valley found himself thinking of a movie. It wasn’t Jaws he thought about, but Basic Instinct. But this chick wasn’t any thing like Sharon Stone. First of all, instead of being blond, this chick was a brunette. She had short hair, cut like a guy’s. Shit, she looked like “just one of the guys” if all you saw was her hair. But, oh man, if you managed to look at anything else, man, you really were sure this was a woman. One hell of a woman, too. There she sat, telling Berk to shut the fuck up, and she wasn’t wearing any clothes. Well, she did have on a pair of stockings and some high heals, but that was it. Apart from that, the only other thing covering her was that towel that she had on over her shoulders. Her hair was wet, so she occasionally lifted up the towel to wipe the water off it. Valley could sympathize with her, but she still got him. Got him feeling for her a way he’d been told he shouldn’t. Damn, she had a nice rack. Just huge, so big that Valley kind of worried that it might hurt her back when she walked. He thought about asking her what bra size she had and decided against it. Even if he could somehow work that into sounding like a legitimate question --- a question he’s supposed to ask ---, he doubted she had ever worn one.

The thing that reminded Valley about that movie was her... Damn, he couldn’t think of way to put it which wouldn’t make him sick enough to puke. He’d never said any of the obscene words in his life (had heard it called a million disgusting things) and even the “nice” things it was called sounded dirty. Regardless of what he could think of calling it, she covered it with only her hands. Both hands clasping each other, except when she shook a fist at Berk or when she shrugged. Valley loved the shrug. When she did that, both hands went up, not just one. He got to see the whole works when she shrugged and it even moved.

“… You see?”

“Yes, I do, miss. We see a whole fucking lot. Davie here probably is seeing more of you than he’d ever seen of a woman in his life. I mean, I doubt this is the first time he’d ever seen a naked woman, but he’s acting as if this were the first time he’d seen one seeing him seeing her.” Berk. Fucking Berk making fun of him again.
     
“That’s David Valley, please. Call me that and I’ll call you ‘Tim Berk.’ Hell, I might even call you ‘Timothy.’ But you call me anything other than ‘David’ or ‘Valley,’ and I’ll call you much worse.”

Berk smiles. “You wanna show her your fig leaf, David?”

Valley ignores that. “In what way did you mean that, ‘you see’?” he asks her, hoping she wasn’t asking him if he liked what he saw. He felt that if she had been, then he might just vomit all over that damp boy’s hair of hers and she’d have to take another shower. He might even stay to watch… Call it his civic duty to help her wash his puke out of her hair and clean it off her back. He’d love to get a look at what her ass looked like.

“I didn’t have a chance to say what I meant before this asshole interrupted. I was saying, ‘you see,’ and before I could continue, Old Faithful decided to ejaculate again. But, looking at him, I guess only his mouth could do that. He just talks so fucking much because his little buddy is shriveled little interrogatory. No exclamations out of this one. Just questions nobody wants to answer. Questions like, ‘why can’t I get the damn thing to stand up on it’s own?’ I bet he squats when he pees.”

“He sure does,” answers one of the other guys. Valley doesn’t know his name, but he’s sure it’s safe to say he can tell him and the other guy who’s name he can’t remember apart. The one who just said something Valley had wanted to say is black. The other guy, well, it’s safe to say he isn’t. Funny. Three words. So far, in the hour they’ve been here, one of them finally said something. And with those three words, Valley was sure of two things. The first that was he liked this one. This brother. And the other was that the other one must be either ten times hornier than Valley himself was, or just simply dead. He was sure if he touched that guy, he might just fall over backwards, as rigid as he’d been chiseled from stone. That brought a smile to his face. Saying a guy as fat as that was “chiseled” had to be a great joke.

Berk sneered. He didn’t look at the black guy, but he stared right at the smile on Valley’s face. Valley smiled again, and pointed at the wooden Indian over there standing next to the black guy he liked. Berk walked right up to the fat guy and slapped him in the face. Sure enough, the big bastard fainted.

No statue this one. He proved to have far less grace. He fell back, slammed the back of his head against the book case (a book case that sported no books, but a healthy collection of the articles that Berk had mentioned was in the bathroom), fell forward, and landed with head in the chick’s lap. She then kicked him in his balls and threw him down to the floor. Valley had to envy the guy. Heck, he even respected him a little. Even unconscious, he still got a chance to give her a big kiss down there. And, despite the fact she’d kicked him so hard that his balls must of detonated with pain, the guy lay there, smiling.

“Anyone, you see, I’m not saying the guy was a shark. I’m just saying that you remember when the girl got attacked? She got shaken around like a goddamn rag doll and she didn’t see what was doing it to her? Like that. Goddamn rag doll.”

“You didn’t see him?” Berk, oh fuck, that kick must of scared him, because Berk was actually writing this down. He’d suddenly dropped the pig act and was acting like he was doing his job. And forget him being a cop. This guy was suddenly a fucking police officer.

“No, I didn’t see him. Didn’t see his face. Didn’t see him at all. But I sure as hell felt it.”

“You weren’t awake during this?” Writing it down.

“I was awake.”

“He blindfold you?”

“No.”

“So how come you didn’t see him? You wear glasses?”

“Yes, but I was wearing them when it happened.” She actually reaches behind Valley, leaning forward in the bed, touching her lips to his… to him… then pulls back her arm with a pair of glasses in her hand. She puts them on. “I just didn’t want to see that ugly face of yours,” she says, and smiles at Berk.

Berk writes this down. Valley would be goddamned if he didn’t it write in third person as if she hadn’t insulted him. Something like, “didn’t want to see Berk’s ‘ugly face.’”

“I was on the phone at the time, just got out of the shower and I was calling my sister. Stupid fucking bitch mentioned her probably being pregnant. Fuck. Here I’m working for three years, not a goddamn one of them wanted to wear a damn glove, and the stupid bitch gets herself knocked up by that fucking retard boyfriend of hers. KIDS! Any way, I was talking and then all of a sudden, I get thrown right across the room and land in the bed.”

“What time was this?”

“12:01am.”

“When was this finished?”

“12:01.”

“Uh, that fast? Or that slow?”

“One second. Not twelve hours. After it happened, I asked Steph if she’d heard anything weird. She said she was talking, I’d said ‘Oh!’ and that was it. Didn’t notice anything.”

“Oh?”

“Yep. I get raped by the fucking Flash and she thinks I’m saying ‘Oh!’ Damn, I wish they were all that quick. Average jerk wants to try for fifteen minutes even though he’s done way before that. Just under one second of work, and, well, then that.” She says this, then points at the nightstand by the bed. On it, there’s the most money Valley had ever seen in his life. He was also pretty sure that it wasn’t the most this hooker had seen. Sure, when she’d been a waitress, it would have been. But now, with her current employment, he guessed she spent that much on just a couple of those toys of hers. One of them had a handle resembling a light saber right outta Star Wars. And if that damn thing didn’t glow in the dark, well, then Valley’s new friend over there was probably just a white guy pretending to be black.

SCENE 6

He sat in a furnace. He crouched in a gathering of flames so hot that they burned as they were a small pocket of hell upon the earth. He did not notice the fire, though. It did not burn him, nor did his face look as if he realized where he sat. He seemed as casual as if he’d been simply perched in the midst of a warm bath tub full of tepid water rather than in an inferno.

His hands clasped his knees and the wrists were slit with thunder bolts of incisions and blood poured freely into his lap. Once in a while, he would hold his flayed wrists to his lips and drink of his own blood. The blood flowed and was endless, an ocean of scarlet stuff that was boiled by the flames as it rested in his lap. The hairs all over his body were aflame as well, as was the hair on his head. But, instead of screams of pain, his lips only loosed giggles of satisfaction and maniacal bouts of laughter. In between giggles and laughter, he chanted the same fragment of words incessantly.

“Raven’s Feather from unwholesome fen… Raven’s Feather from unwholesome fen… Raven’s Feather from unwholesome fen… Raven’s Feather from unwholesome fen… Raven’s Feather from unwholesome fen… Raven’s Feather from unwholesome fen…”

Cackling with laughter, seated casually in an inferno of flames that did not burn him, bleeding profusely from the wrists, genitals boiling in blood, he chanted.

He stared straight up towards the ceiling. Upon it, he’d drawn a five-pointed star --- a pentagram --- with his own blood, but it wasn’t long before he saw through the ceiling, though the pentagram stayed in his vision (reflecting the flames that did not burn him) and he could see the night beyond and the moons above him in the dark.

SCENE 7

Words. He closes in his eyes and hears words in his ears. Words being spoken to him. “she looked like ‘just one of the guys’ if all you saw was.” Raven’s Feather laughed harder as he released the words were not spoken to him, but were actually another man’s thoughts. Thinking of him. No. Thinking of a woman in whose body he now resided. He opened the woman’s eyes while his own stayed firmly shut. He opened her eyes and saw another world.

Men were standing around the woman where she sat. One of them was staring intently at her hair and his thoughts were heard clearly as if spoken, and more, what he could see --- was seeing --- was painted on his forehead as if it were a living tattoo.  “But, oh man, if you managed to look at anything else, man, you really were sure this was a woman. One hell of a woman, too.”

The man standing to the staring man’s left was speaking to the woman and her head moved to face him. She saw her own face on his mind. Only her face. He was looking at nothing else but her face, centering his gaze on her eyes.

The woman (“did have on a pair of stockings and some high”) lifted a hand to her face, saw her own reflection (“had a nice rack. Just huge, so big”) in the other man’s mind do the same thing. The hair was very short, as the first man had thought. From the rambling of his thoughts, she knew he was staring at her breasts even though she didn’t bother to check to see if his mind showed them. (“might hurt her back”). She laughed at this one, not even guessing what he might of meant by that. She sensed he liked it when she laughed, but he “loved the shrug.” She waved at the other man, smiling as she waved back in his mind picture.

She couldn’t sense the other mens’ thoughts. They weren’t a direct chain of thoughts organized as if spoken, but more like pictures of what these men wished to perform with her, regardless if she wanted to or not. Especially if she didn’t. But she wanted to.

She turned to the first man, saw her breasts focused intently upon his mind, and she raised his hands to them, caressed her own breasts. His eyes widened and his mouth fell open. Then, she froze all of them still with a word.

And they were all frozen as if statues, staring at the bed where she sat even as she got up from it. Not even their mind pictures changed. For all intents and purposes, they only saw her sitting in the bed and not walking across the room. She went to the first man, kneeled before his rigid body, and took his pants off. She then crawled behind him, let one hand sneak in front and grab him in the center of his being (between his legs) for a moment to make sure he was ready for what she wanted him to do, then pushed him. He fell over as his he were a statue over-turned on his pedestal and his face fell into the pillows where she had sat.

She climbed beneath his frozen body again, put only the part of him that she had willed back to life inside of herself, then writhed and floundered beneath him. She did this underneath him for what could have been called days had not she frozen the entire world in place and it wasn’t only until she had been satiated a thousand times or more that she finished with him. She then pulled his pants back up, stood him back him where he’d been, and returned to her place on the bed.

Then she willed the world to unfreeze. He coerced the woman into speaking just two words: “… You see?”

“Yes, I do, miss. We see a whole fucking lot,” the other man was saying. The thing inside her asked her what he was and she answered with three words in her thoughts: “cop, fucking asshole.” The thing inside her laughed. “Maybe he’s just jealous,” it said. “Jealous of what?” the woman’s thoughts asked it, but it would not answer.

 The “fucking asshole” of a “cop” continued: “Davie here probably is seeing more of you than he’d ever seen of a woman in his life. I mean, I doubt this is the first time he’d ever seen a naked woman, but he’s acting as if this were the first time he’d seen one seeing him seeing her.”

“Berk," the first man’s thoughts said. “Fucking Berk making fun of me again.” But he kept these to himself and only the thing in the woman heard him. He spoke aloud instead: “That’s David Valley, please. Call me that and I’ll call you ‘Tim Berk.’ Hell, I might even call you ‘Timothy.’ But you call me anything other than ‘David’ or ‘Valley,’ and I’ll call you much worse.”

Berk smiles. “You wanna show her your fig leaf, David?” At that, the woman looked at him, saw naked man whose genitals discreetly covered with a leaf in his thoughts. Ah. This one was so boring, he even censored his own mental image.

Valley ignores that. “In what way did you mean that, ‘you see’?” he asks her. She can clearing read his thoughts: “clean it off her back. He’d love to get a look at what her ass looked like.”

The thing inside of the woman is happily surprised as the woman speaks, sharing in the conversation: “I didn’t have a chance to say what I meant before this asshole interrupted. I was saying, ‘you see,’ and before I could continue, Old Faithful decided to ejaculate again. But, looking at him, I guess only his mouth could do that.

"He just talks so fucking much because his little buddy is shriveled little interrogatory. No exclamations out of this one. Just questions nobody wants to answer. Questions like, ‘why can’t I get the damn thing to stand up on it’s own?’ I bet he squats when he pees.”

“He sure does,” answers a man with very dark, brown skin. She searches in Valley’s mind and only comes up with the words “black cop.”

She looks into the dark skinned man’s mind, can only find a picture of what he wants to do to her; something his mind insists on calling “doggie-style.” Other than that, only Cassius Clay seems to be the only name in his mind, not even a hint of whether or not he himself is this Clay man. “Then again,” says the thing in the woman’s mind, “these are all my Clay Men!” She freezes time again while the men are in the midst of a bitter silence. She goes to Cassius, does the same thing she had done with the first man, only this time she faces away from him and bends at the waist.

She intends to force him into her and do it like a pair of “doggies” would but he balks somehow. She isn't too alarmed. His expression had changed for a moment to a look of shock. She slaps him, but he doesn't appear to feel it.

When finished with the experiment, she sets him to rights and then starts to walk back to the bed. On her way, she stops. She looks at Berk. Smiling, she takes a pad of paper from a pocket in his pants and places it & a pen into his hands. She then shoots him pictures of her previous encounters with his fellows into his mind and commands him to draw them on the pad of paper. The command given, she sits down again. Unfreezes.

Valley thinks: “Saying a guy as fat as that was ‘chiseled’ had to be a great joke.” She looks up at his face, sees the face of the “tub of lard” he’s looking at in his mind and seriously doubts she’d want to do anything to him. The man is so ugly the only thing she would want to do to him is kill him.

Berk sneered. He didn’t look at the black guy, but he stared right at the smile on Valley’s face. Valley smiled again, and pointed at the wooden Indian over there standing next to the black guy he liked. Berk walked right up to the fat guy and slapped him in the face. Sure enough, the big bastard fainted. Freeze.

The woman laughs in incredible good humor. She hadn’t told Berk to do that, but she now wishes she did. She turns her gaze to the first man and to the dark skinned man. She has claimed their souls as completely as she had claimed the woman in which she now breathed. She kept their minds frozen and blinded their eyes, but brought them entirely to life from their necks down. She makes them attack the fat man. Fists slam into his stomach a hundred times. Feet impact with his genitals dozens of times. They break his arms for her and she laughs. They hold him up, one man behind and the other in front, both pairs of hands strangling the fat man by his throat. Four pairs of hands lift him up and slam his head on the ceiling four scores of times. Four hands break his neck. They throw him against the wall and all freeze once more.

The fat man is as good as dead the very instant that she returns him to himself. She has the two men return to their places and the fat man slammed the back of his head against the book case fell forward (the vertebrae in his neck finally emitting the SNAP of his spine being broken), and landed with head in the chick’s lap. She then kicked him in his balls and threw him down to the floor.

And, despite the fact she’d kicked him so hard that his balls must of detonated with pain, the guy lay there, smiling.

The woman now speaks again: “Any way, you see, I’m not saying the guy was a shark. I’m just saying that you remember when the girl got attacked? She got shaken around like a goddamn rag doll and she didn’t see what was doing it to her? Like that. Goddamn rag doll.”

“You didn’t see him?”  Valley’s thoughts: “Berk, oh fuck, that kick must of scared him, because Berk was actually writing this down.” The woman considered correcting him, but was delighted with look of shock in Berk’s eyes as drew those awful pictures in that note book of his completely without his volition.

“No, I didn’t see him. Didn’t see his face. Didn’t see him at all. But I sure as hell felt it.” Raven’s Feather laughs. “I hope you felt what you just did to these men,” he says to her before he leaves.

SCENE 8

As the cops leave, a homeless woman busily inspecting a dumpster suddenly stops what she is doing. She leaps out of the dumpster and walks shakily to the edge of the alley. She quietly mutters to herself, “Please! I am not of your ilk, Satan” and then subsides.

Her eyes move of their own volition, picking out two men in plainclothes. They are all poorly dressed. She can tell just by looking at them that they are detectives of some sort. She can smell the stench of bacon upon them as easily as she smells the cheap cologne they all wear. She tries to pull herself back into the shadows more but instead walks towards the detectives. She stops, standing across the street from them.
SCENE 9



A million miles away, her controllers confer. “We have an Undesirable,” speaks one person. “We are aware of this, Alphie,” is the reply.

Alphie makes a sound of disgust.  

Papa Bear, VO:  “Report, Alphie.”

Alphie: “The old broad wet herself is all.”

Momma Bear: “We are not amused, Alphie. She is of no consequence. Stick to the details.”

Alphie: “Well, the Undesirable seems highly skilled. We felt a time flux. Not sure how long it lasted or what was done.”

Poppa Bear: “Have you located the Undesirable?”

Alphie: “He’s not one of ours. And I’ll be damned if I can figure out his signature. You know I’m good at that sort of thing.”

Momma Bear: “Cut the crap, Alphie. No bragging.”

Alphie: “My apologies. I don’t feel this one is of this world. I’m getting a real occult feel from it.”

Poppa Bear: “We’ve discussed this, Alphie. There are no parallel universes or wormholes. Our Undie is of this world. We have to find him & incorporate him into our way of doing things.”

Alphie: “Yes, I know. Otherwise he’s a threat to National security.”

Poppa Bear: “Exactly, Alphie.”

Alphie: “Uh… bad news.”

Momma Bear: “What, Alphie.”

Alphie: “I’ve lost the vital signs of the fourth detective to enter the residence. He still hasn’t left the apartment.”

Poppa Bear: “Shit, Alphie.”

Alphie: “Why not? This broad’s already soiled herself.”

Momma Bear: “That isn’t what we met, Alphie. Put her back where you found her and calm  her down if you have to.”

Alphie: “Acknowledged.” The old woman gingerly about-faces. The detectives still haven't noticed her. She gratefully walks back into the alley where she’d come from. Before she reaches the dumpster, she loudly shouts, “Praise you, Jesus, for rescuing me!”

SCENE 10


Valley & Berk share a look. Their black counterpart has gone back inside to retrieve Sleeping Beauty. They haven’t yet realized how deeply in trouble they are yet. But they soon will.


Valley was the first to re-enter the residence. It turned out the black detective's name was Baker. Baker  had gone back in expecting to find his sad sack of partner trying to get the whore to give him a freebie. He wouldn't pay for anything if he could weasel his way around a bill. Turns out they found the fourth man was very dead.

The whore herself was hanging from the shower head from a pair of her own panties. An autopsy performed on her body revealed that almost all of the men who'd interrogated her had somehow taken turns with the woman. Each man denied it. One of the deceased, Jannels, had recorded the whole proceeding with a mini-cassette recorder. Each man testified that none of the lewd comments spoken or the love-making noises on the tape were made by themselves.

The story made the  papers briefly but as with all things that happen in this Rotten Apple of ours, it was soon forgotten. One thing was certain... Raven's Feather had transgressed The Divide.
